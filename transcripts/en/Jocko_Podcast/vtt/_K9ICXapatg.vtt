This is Jocko podcast number one 48 with Echo Charles and me,

2
00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:09.220
Jocko Willink.
Good Evening Echo.
Good evening,

3
00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:13.270
20 November,
1950

4
00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:17.650
dear mister and Missus Richardson,

5
00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:23.680
I regret that I must confirm my recent telegram in which you were informed that

6
00:00:23.681 --> 00:00:27.220
your son,
Master Sergeant William J.

7
00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:32.220
Richardson Infantry has been reported missing in action in Korea since two

8
00:00:32.561 --> 00:00:34.420
November,
1950

9
00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:41.980
I know that added distress is caused by failure to receive any more information

10
00:00:43.041 --> 00:00:44.840
or details.
Therefore,

11
00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:49.930
I wish to assure you that at any time additional information is received,

12
00:00:49.991 --> 00:00:53.090
it will be transmitted to you without delay.

13
00:00:55.790 --> 00:01:00.790
The term missing in action is used only to indicate that the whereabouts or

14
00:01:02.181 --> 00:01:04.940
status of an individual is not immediately known.

15
00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:06.350
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

16
00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:10.520
<v 0>it is not intended to convey the impression that the case is closed.</v>

17
00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:16.700
I wish to emphasize that every effort is exerted continuously to clear up the

18
00:01:16.701 --> 00:01:20.890
status of our personnel under battle conditions.

19
00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:25.360
This is a difficult task as you must readily realize.

20
00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:31.360
Experience has shown that many persons reported missing in action are

21
00:01:31.361 --> 00:01:36.361
subsequently reported as return to duty or being hospitalized for injuries

22
00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:40.980
in order to relieve financial worry.

23
00:01:40.981 --> 00:01:45.690
On the part of the dependence of military personnel being carried in a missing

24
00:01:45.691 --> 00:01:50.160
in action status.
Congress enacted legislation legislation,

25
00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:55.340
which continues the pay allowance and allotments of such persons until their

26
00:01:55.501 --> 00:01:58.080
status is definitely established.

27
00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:04.630
Permit me to extend to you my heartfelt sympathy during this period of

28
00:02:05.421 --> 00:02:06.254
uncertainty.

29
00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:07.670
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

30
00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:09.050
<v 0>Sincerely Yours,</v>

31
00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:14.860
Edward F with cell Major General US army.

32
00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:21.683
So

33
00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:27.750
obviously that is a letter from the government about a missing soldier,

34
00:02:27.751 --> 00:02:29.160
this missing soldier in this case,

35
00:02:29.161 --> 00:02:34.161
is it William Richardson and William Richardson or Bill Richardson,

36
00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:41.690
who was a part of that whole melee that unfolded in the beginning of the Korean

37
00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.823
War

38
00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:49.670
when the eighth army was caught off from the rest of coalition forces and many

39
00:02:51.091 --> 00:02:55.920
of those that got caught off as that retreat took place.

40
00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:00.100
Many Americans and South Koreans as well were captured,

41
00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:04.300
were killed or otherwise they were somehow lost or missing.

42
00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:09.670
And this guy,
Bill Richardson,

43
00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:11.270
was one of those men,

44
00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:16.810
one of those men that went missing and clearly from this letter,

45
00:03:16.811 --> 00:03:21.811
his parents were notified about that and he wrote a book on these experiences

46
00:03:24.641 --> 00:03:27.430
that he went through.
The book is called valleys of death,

47
00:03:27.431 --> 00:03:29.590
a memoir of the Korean War,

48
00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:36.070
and you actually has that letter from the army too.

49
00:03:36.071 --> 00:03:39.880
His parents inside the book,
which is a pretty shocking thing to see.

50
00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:45.940
And you know these days the with with the current way they notify,

51
00:03:45.941 --> 00:03:47.710
they send people to your house.

52
00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:52.120
But I can't even imagine that the old days when you just get a telegram or a

53
00:03:52.121 --> 00:03:54.020
letter that shows up and says that your,

54
00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:58.300
your son's been missing for three weeks or four weeks or whatever the case may

55
00:03:58.301 --> 00:04:01.540
be.
But this book,

56
00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:03.603
I definitely,

57
00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.020
there's the combat in this book is out a hand and you're going to see that

58
00:04:08.021 --> 00:04:12.970
pretty quick.
And like every other book that we review on here,

59
00:04:12.971 --> 00:04:14.830
obviously I can't read the whole thing,

60
00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:19.660
but definitely this book is worth getting valleys of death,

61
00:04:19.661 --> 00:04:24.661
a memoir of the Korean War written by Colonel William or Bill Richardson.

62
00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:30.370
And it's a phenomenal book.
So with that,

63
00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:33.610
let's dive right into it.

64
00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:39.480
He lays out a little bit of his perspective writing the book here in the,

65
00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:42.370
in the preface of the book.
And here we go.

66
00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:46.360
This is not a history of the Korean War.
It is a down dirty.

67
00:04:46.361 --> 00:04:50.590
Look at some of the soldiers who five years before had experienced combat and

68
00:04:50.591 --> 00:04:53.800
the Second World War.
It is the story of the men.

69
00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:58.570
They would lead a new generation of courageous young soldiers in what would be

70
00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:01.000
the last true infantry war.

71
00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:05.500
The heroes of this story are the young man of the Third Battalion,

72
00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:07.000
Eighth Cavalry Regiment,

73
00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:11.320
and in particular the men of the weapons platoon of El Company.

74
00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:13.480
<v 1>Okay?</v>

75
00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:14.560
<v 0>Most of them died.</v>

76
00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:16.730
<v 1>Okay?</v>

77
00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:19.190
<v 0>The story is told through my own eyes.</v>

78
00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:25.000
I've made a strong attempt to avoid adding to the story what others have said or

79
00:05:25.491 --> 00:05:28.580
what I have learned over the last 57 years,

80
00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:32.670
but there are a few truths that are undeniable.

81
00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:39.610
Korea was a war that neither the country nor the military was ready for and we

82
00:05:39.651 --> 00:05:42.200
paid a high price for a lack of readiness.

83
00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:48.290
The disaster at [inaudible] written about in this book was caused by a lapse of

84
00:05:48.291 --> 00:05:51.380
leadership from the highest echelon down to the battalion level.

85
00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:57.230
Mistakes we paid for with the blood of the most heroic

86
00:05:58.950 --> 00:06:03.440
I have ever known.
And you know,

87
00:06:03.441 --> 00:06:07.820
when we covered chesty puller,
he talked a lot about that,

88
00:06:07.821 --> 00:06:11.180
a lot about the lack of readiness and if you remember the marine corps throwing

89
00:06:11.181 --> 00:06:14.300
together battalions to try and get over there.

90
00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:17.240
And that was the whole country that was doing this.

91
00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:21.740
And in the beginning of this book it,
you know,
he talks about,

92
00:06:21.741 --> 00:06:25.520
he kind of introduces the characters that he was with.

93
00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:29.180
He talks about some of the training that they had been through.

94
00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:33.620
He was part of a squad that fired the 57 they called it,

95
00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:36.290
which is a recoilless rifle,
the m 18

96
00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:42.710
to 57 millimeter recoilless rifle.
Basically it looks like a bazooka,

97
00:06:42.711 --> 00:06:46.610
kind of your traditional,
if you're in your mind,
you picture the Bazooka.

98
00:06:46.850 --> 00:06:47.960
That's sort of what it looks like.

99
00:06:47.961 --> 00:06:50.870
And there's a bunch of different variations of the Bazooka and this is sort of

100
00:06:50.871 --> 00:06:55.520
one of them.
And in this point when we pick up the book,

101
00:06:55.521 --> 00:06:59.990
he's kind of gone through that and they actually are now heading on callow to

102
00:06:59.991 --> 00:07:02.390
California on their way to war.
So you know,

103
00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:06.350
he'd covers the kickoff of the war and what that was like and him kind of

104
00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:10.730
getting back in the game.
And here we go.

105
00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:15.410
They're heading to California to get on a ship to go to Korea for the war.

106
00:07:16.250 --> 00:07:20.930
Back to the book,
there was a gravity to it.
We were on the doorstep of war.

107
00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:25.370
We all knew it and want it to be disciplined because when the bullets started,

108
00:07:25.670 --> 00:07:29.030
discipline could be the difference between life and death.

109
00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:32.480
That is indeed true.

110
00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:37.220
Continuing the war in Korea had reached a crisis level.

111
00:07:38.030 --> 00:07:40.820
American and South Korean units were fighting for their lives.

112
00:07:41.090 --> 00:07:45.350
They'd been swept from the 38th parallel and quickly forced out of soul.

113
00:07:45.890 --> 00:07:48.590
The North Koreans swept south towards Pusan,

114
00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:52.010
a port on the eastern tip of the Korean Peninsula.

115
00:07:53.030 --> 00:07:57.620
Now our troops were making their last stand along the NAC tongue river in the

116
00:07:57.621 --> 00:08:02.621
west and and align north of the taboo reaching east to the Sea of Japan and they

117
00:08:04.701 --> 00:08:09.701
were heading on the US troop transport ship called the pope,

118
00:08:10.790 --> 00:08:13.220
which had just been taken out of mothballs.
If you don't know this,

119
00:08:13.221 --> 00:08:16.850
they take old old ships when they're not needed.

120
00:08:17.630 --> 00:08:21.260
They put them up while they put them in a couple of places around the country,

121
00:08:21.261 --> 00:08:25.130
but they put them up and they called it mothballs and then they just leave these

122
00:08:25.131 --> 00:08:29.900
big old ships sitting there.
If they,
if they ever are needed again,

123
00:08:29.901 --> 00:08:32.150
they can pull them out and kind of get them up to speed.

124
00:08:32.151 --> 00:08:33.050
So that's what the pope was.

125
00:08:33.051 --> 00:08:36.470
It was a vessel that was pulled out of mothballs and now was getting ready to

126
00:08:36.740 --> 00:08:41.740
sail overseas and these guys get on and the head overseas and then back to the

127
00:08:42.381 --> 00:08:45.710
book after eight days on bar onboard the ship word spread that we were getting

128
00:08:45.711 --> 00:08:50.270
close to Japan.
We do another month of training before landing in Korea.

129
00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:54.800
We crowded along the rail looking at the shore lights in the distance,

130
00:08:55.530 --> 00:08:58.530
the water made the lights from the city look like stars.

131
00:08:59.970 --> 00:09:02.280
It's Yokohama and we're headed right for it.

132
00:09:02.580 --> 00:09:07.580
I heard a soldier say suddenly the ship started slowly turning to the starboard

133
00:09:10.170 --> 00:09:12.330
and running south parallel to the shore.

134
00:09:13.290 --> 00:09:13.840
<v 1>Okay.</v>

135
00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:14.920
<v 0>I didn't think much of it,</v>

136
00:09:16.090 --> 00:09:21.090
but the next morning we were informed that we were going straight to Korea.

137
00:09:25.370 --> 00:09:27.560
There you go.
That's the way the military works.

138
00:09:27.561 --> 00:09:30.380
Sometimes you're think you're going to go train for an extra month and you have

139
00:09:30.381 --> 00:09:33.860
a little bit more time to prepare for combat and all of a sudden that time's

140
00:09:33.861 --> 00:09:38.000
gone and you're going straight in straight into the combat scenario.

141
00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:43.240
So that's why everyone out there in the military don't wait till tomorrow to

142
00:09:43.371 --> 00:09:47.210
train.
It's not going to come or it may not come.

143
00:09:48.920 --> 00:09:53.660
So they pull into this port and Pusan back the book,
the smell was unbearable.

144
00:09:53.990 --> 00:09:58.550
The water around the dock dock at Pusan was black and slick with oil and sewage

145
00:09:59.060 --> 00:09:59.631
to docs.

146
00:09:59.631 --> 00:10:04.280
Up from where we were was a cattle holding area where and when they cleaned the

147
00:10:04.281 --> 00:10:08.360
pens,
they just host everything into the water.
The pungent odor hate us.

148
00:10:08.361 --> 00:10:12.500
As we approached the pier,
most of the guys stayed below out of the smell,

149
00:10:12.710 --> 00:10:15.620
but I stayed on the deck mesmerized by the port.

150
00:10:17.300 --> 00:10:21.650
The eighth army had established a perimeter to hold off the Koreans,
people,

151
00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:23.720
the Korean people's Army,

152
00:10:23.780 --> 00:10:28.580
until enough troops could arrive and organize a counter offensive set up in

153
00:10:28.610 --> 00:10:29.443
August,

154
00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:34.370
the perimeters western boundary boundary was formed mostly by the nok tongue

155
00:10:34.371 --> 00:10:35.204
river.

156
00:10:36.500 --> 00:10:39.650
The North Koreans crossed the knocked on river

157
00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:44.660
and then he says,
I know one thing.

158
00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:48.770
If you're defending a river and the enemy is on your side,
you're in trouble.

159
00:10:50.450 --> 00:10:54.110
That evening,
after another dinner of sea rations,

160
00:10:54.380 --> 00:10:56.210
I got the section together.
This is his,

161
00:10:56.270 --> 00:10:59.720
his little section of troops that he's running.
He's in charge of I want,

162
00:10:59.721 --> 00:11:02.690
and here's what he tells them.
I want everyone to check his gear one more time.

163
00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:06.980
We're moving to an assembly area north of the taboo first thing in the morning

164
00:11:08.180 --> 00:11:12.170
and take a moment to write home.
You never know when you'll get another chance.

165
00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:15.760
And that's one of those things that,

166
00:11:17.820 --> 00:11:18.653
<v 1>okay,</v>

167
00:11:19.100 --> 00:11:22.140
<v 0>that can be perhaps a pretty heavy statement when he's saying that.
And I'll,</v>

168
00:11:22.141 --> 00:11:25.850
I'll tell you when you're in that situation,
if you,
especially if you're young,

169
00:11:25.940 --> 00:11:27.710
at least in my situation,

170
00:11:28.550 --> 00:11:30.560
if someone would have told me that when I was 19 years old,

171
00:11:30.561 --> 00:11:34.910
I would've been fired up.
And that's just the way it is.
Um,

172
00:11:36.350 --> 00:11:39.950
yeah,
I guess.
Um,
some people think it's crazy to think that way,

173
00:11:39.951 --> 00:11:41.240
but I'm telling you,

174
00:11:41.241 --> 00:11:46.241
there's a whole group of human beings in the world that they have a little

175
00:11:47.030 --> 00:11:51.560
genetic makeup that makes them want to go to war.
And so when you get told,

176
00:11:51.710 --> 00:11:54.520
hey,
you know,
you write your last letter home,

177
00:11:54.940 --> 00:11:59.410
you're actually pretty fired up about it again.

178
00:11:59.470 --> 00:12:04.210
I know that sounds completely crazy.
And even thing is,
he was a little bit older.

179
00:12:04.570 --> 00:12:08.770
So I think for him he had,
it had more gravity for him than it did for his boys.

180
00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:15.100
The other thing is I think it's hard for them to have recognized,

181
00:12:15.190 --> 00:12:18.100
even though they read in the news like how bad it was.

182
00:12:18.640 --> 00:12:21.190
And we've heard this from other people too.
We've heard this from other people.

183
00:12:21.370 --> 00:12:23.720
Like you always think it's not going to be you,
right?
Yeah.

184
00:12:23.770 --> 00:12:26.620
It's not going to be me that gets,
that gets killed.
It's not going to be,

185
00:12:26.650 --> 00:12:27.790
that's not going to happen to me.

186
00:12:28.180 --> 00:12:30.130
So you have that little thing in your brain too.

187
00:12:30.131 --> 00:12:33.550
We just think it won't happen to you.
So

188
00:12:35.050 --> 00:12:38.950
you aren't that concerned about it.
And the other thing is like you're,
you,

189
00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:39.131
you know,

190
00:12:39.131 --> 00:12:44.080
you just got done what we just got done with world war two where all this heavy

191
00:12:44.081 --> 00:12:48.220
combat,
and guess what?
We were back to back World War champions,
right?

192
00:12:48.221 --> 00:12:50.160
America was back to back World War champion.

193
00:12:50.161 --> 00:12:54.310
So how are we going to get into a worse situation on this little random little

194
00:12:54.580 --> 00:12:58.210
Asian country,
little peninsula,
like this won't be a factor.

195
00:12:58.240 --> 00:13:02.670
So you had to have that in your head a little bit.
Yeah.
To,
uh,

196
00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:05.860
I don't think they recognized how serious the situation was even though they

197
00:13:05.861 --> 00:13:08.770
were saying it.
My point is that even though you're getting told,
hey,

198
00:13:08.771 --> 00:13:10.560
this is a dire situation and we're,

199
00:13:10.660 --> 00:13:14.500
we're holding up a perimeter to try and wait for more troops to arrives so we

200
00:13:14.501 --> 00:13:17.740
can actually do a counter offensive.
Even though you're here that you're like,

201
00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:22.510
all right,
that's no big deal.
We'll handle it in my mind.
Again,
I'm trying,

202
00:13:22.511 --> 00:13:25.780
I'm trying to transpose a 19 year old brain on this situation.

203
00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:31.330
All right.
Going back to the book,
the trains to Tegu left just afternoon.

204
00:13:32.290 --> 00:13:36.640
I heard a few cheers as the train picked up momentum,
so there you go.
I'm right,

205
00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:40.780
right.
The train is heading to combat and what are the boys doing?
Their cheering,

206
00:13:42.460 --> 00:13:46.270
the train lumbering down the track for a while and then stopped at a siding.

207
00:13:47.410 --> 00:13:50.860
Word came back that we were near the assembly area but had to make way for a

208
00:13:50.861 --> 00:13:52.900
hospital train,
headed self.

209
00:13:55.230 --> 00:13:58.740
The train carrying the wounded stopped for a few moments and we could see the

210
00:13:58.741 --> 00:14:02.760
soldiers inside.
[inaudible] bags hung next to litters.

211
00:14:03.420 --> 00:14:06.300
Men with bandages,
arms,
legs,

212
00:14:06.390 --> 00:14:08.550
and heads lined the cars,

213
00:14:09.330 --> 00:14:12.690
the few walking wounded stared out the windows.

214
00:14:13.890 --> 00:14:16.140
The wounded Americans had dark,

215
00:14:16.170 --> 00:14:19.140
depressing eyes and a vacant stare.

216
00:14:20.590 --> 00:14:24.190
A few of our guys tried to pass them cigarettes and candy from the window,

217
00:14:25.570 --> 00:14:30.280
but they didn't react.
They just stared into space.

218
00:14:32.620 --> 00:14:33.970
So there's your reality check.

219
00:14:35.530 --> 00:14:38.680
That's what we're heading for and that's a little wake up call.

220
00:14:38.740 --> 00:14:42.190
I doubt that the there was cheers when the plane,
when they're trained,

221
00:14:42.191 --> 00:14:45.940
rolled north again and they go from trains.

222
00:14:45.941 --> 00:14:50.350
Eventually they get off trains and next up is they're getting into some troop

223
00:14:50.351 --> 00:14:53.780
transport.
And here we go back to the book.
As the trucks rumble forward,

224
00:14:53.990 --> 00:14:58.430
we could see American troops moving south down the road.
They looked like ghosts,

225
00:14:58.580 --> 00:15:02.570
frail with torn and dirty uniforms.
They're black eyes,

226
00:15:02.571 --> 00:15:04.490
didn't even register as we passed.

227
00:15:05.240 --> 00:15:09.890
They had the infantry men's thousand yard stare.
They were lost,

228
00:15:10.700 --> 00:15:11.533
gone.

229
00:15:12.530 --> 00:15:17.530
We were operating under Lieutenant General Walton h walkers standing order to

230
00:15:17.811 --> 00:15:20.840
stand or die.
Walker.

231
00:15:21.050 --> 00:15:25.880
The Eighth Army commander had issued the order in July before we arrived.

232
00:15:27.140 --> 00:15:30.650
And here's,
here's the quote from,
from General Walker.

233
00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:32.480
We are fighting a battle against time.

234
00:15:33.770 --> 00:15:38.770
There will be no more retreating withdrawal or readjustment of the lines or any

235
00:15:39.111 --> 00:15:40.550
other term you choose.

236
00:15:41.540 --> 00:15:46.130
There is no line behind us to which we can retreat.
There will be no Dunkirk,

237
00:15:46.250 --> 00:15:47.660
there will be no Bhutan.

238
00:15:49.500 --> 00:15:54.180
A retreat to Pusan would be one of the greatest butchers in history.

239
00:15:54.300 --> 00:15:57.390
We must fight until the end.
We will fight as a team.

240
00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:02.300
If some of us must die,
we will die fighting together.

241
00:16:03.550 --> 00:16:04.210
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

242
00:16:04.210 --> 00:16:08.440
<v 0>I want everybody to understand we are going to hold this line.</v>

243
00:16:10.650 --> 00:16:11.890
We are going to win.

244
00:16:16.270 --> 00:16:17.770
Now.
That's it.
That's a heavy statement.

245
00:16:17.950 --> 00:16:22.930
And if you know a little bit of the background about this Walker General Walker

246
00:16:22.931 --> 00:16:26.410
was in World War One and World War II and now he's in Korea.

247
00:16:27.430 --> 00:16:31.120
And you had MacArthur at the time who was in Japan,

248
00:16:31.780 --> 00:16:35.500
who was basically saying,
hey look,
I don't care.
You're gonna hold the line.

249
00:16:35.920 --> 00:16:40.780
You're gonna hold the line.
Even though Walker was thinking,
Hey,
I need,

250
00:16:40.810 --> 00:16:43.780
you know,
massive support.
I don't know if we can pull this off.

251
00:16:44.470 --> 00:16:47.860
And the order came and he was like,
okay,
and you know,

252
00:16:47.861 --> 00:16:52.000
I mean I talk about this.
If you're getting that command,
you know,

253
00:16:52.001 --> 00:16:54.310
you can't come down and say,
well MacArthur is telling us that we got to,

254
00:16:54.311 --> 00:16:55.900
but I don't think we can do it.
No.
He's like,
okay,

255
00:16:56.230 --> 00:16:57.700
that's what we're going to do our best to do.

256
00:16:57.790 --> 00:17:00.700
Now as you actually study what unfolded.

257
00:17:00.790 --> 00:17:04.180
Eventually he held it as long as he could and then he started to tactically

258
00:17:04.181 --> 00:17:08.980
retreat to the best of his ability and so he sort of compromised.

259
00:17:09.880 --> 00:17:12.010
He didn't just,
they didn't,
didn't stand and get slaughtered.

260
00:17:12.660 --> 00:17:16.750
So he eventually made a more organ,
the best organized retreat that he could,

261
00:17:16.751 --> 00:17:19.420
but still the,
the eighth army was on the run.
If you remember this time,

262
00:17:19.421 --> 00:17:23.110
this is when the marines were tr trying to hold the line as well.

263
00:17:23.111 --> 00:17:27.940
So it was a very hard situation going back to the book,
thick,

264
00:17:27.941 --> 00:17:30.880
black smoke,
Rosen,
a steady stream on the other side of the horizon.

265
00:17:31.090 --> 00:17:33.640
I could see only a few of the squat huts,

266
00:17:33.760 --> 00:17:37.180
but the valley and ridges had fixed scraggly bushes,

267
00:17:37.300 --> 00:17:41.230
which made it very difficult to see any movement.
Suddenly,

268
00:17:41.380 --> 00:17:44.350
artillery shells and mortar rounds crashed down around us.

269
00:17:44.440 --> 00:17:48.010
We dove into ditches that line the road and waited for the barrage to end.

270
00:17:48.430 --> 00:17:52.260
I wave to my section and got them together before we moved out toward the

271
00:17:52.261 --> 00:17:53.520
outskirts of the village,

272
00:17:54.360 --> 00:17:57.720
a smokey haze with a pungent smell of gunpowder hung over us.

273
00:17:57.960 --> 00:17:59.430
As we started moving forward,

274
00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:02.910
I could feel my heart beating and my breasts came quickly,

275
00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:07.830
almost like I was running,
but it wasn't nerves.
It was adrenaline.

276
00:18:08.430 --> 00:18:09.930
My body was on fire,

277
00:18:09.990 --> 00:18:14.990
popping with energy back on the road on North Korean machine gun to our right

278
00:18:15.121 --> 00:18:15.990
open fire.

279
00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:20.370
I could see tracer rounds in almost slow motion dashing into the line of men

280
00:18:20.371 --> 00:18:21.204
ahead of me.

281
00:18:21.720 --> 00:18:25.320
The soldiers duct and dove out of the way as the rounds bit into the dirt around

282
00:18:25.321 --> 00:18:28.770
them.
Time is a strange thing in combat.

283
00:18:29.460 --> 00:18:33.150
Sometimes it moves so fast that you cannot believe it in and other times it is

284
00:18:33.360 --> 00:18:35.520
moving so slowly that you could scream.

285
00:18:36.420 --> 00:18:39.720
We dove into the dirt and pressed ourselves flat against the ground.

286
00:18:40.690 --> 00:18:42.300
Maccabee Maccabee at this time,

287
00:18:42.301 --> 00:18:47.301
as the company commander started moving the other platoons toward the guns while

288
00:18:47.401 --> 00:18:52.050
my section part of the weapons platoon provided supporting fire.
So there you go.

289
00:18:52.051 --> 00:18:56.250
They set up a little cover and move.
This was real combat.

290
00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:59.580
All of my fears seems so far away now.

291
00:19:00.060 --> 00:19:04.500
I didn't have time to worry about how I'd react.
I just had to act.

292
00:19:05.550 --> 00:19:07.440
Turning back towards Walsh's gun.

293
00:19:07.441 --> 00:19:10.350
I yelled for him to get in position and start firing at the machine.
Guns.

294
00:19:10.710 --> 00:19:13.800
Walsh nodded and started calling to his men like veterans.

295
00:19:13.801 --> 00:19:17.250
They ignored the machine gun fire and got the gun up and got ready.

296
00:19:17.730 --> 00:19:19.470
Put some fire on that hail.
I shouted,

297
00:19:19.710 --> 00:19:23.460
pointing toward the North Korean gunners with my hand wash pointed out the

298
00:19:23.461 --> 00:19:25.320
machine gun position and Gomez,

299
00:19:25.321 --> 00:19:30.321
the assistant gunner loaded around and haul cited in the gun and fired my

300
00:19:30.571 --> 00:19:33.960
section.
Fired it's first shot of the war.

301
00:19:34.620 --> 00:19:38.210
So a couple key things that I liked about this paragraph of uh,
you know,

302
00:19:38.220 --> 00:19:42.960
he talks about time and the weird things at time doe does during combat and that

303
00:19:42.961 --> 00:19:47.961
happens during any really stressful situation where you become hyper sensitive

304
00:19:48.901 --> 00:19:51.150
to what's happening in,
in the way it appears.

305
00:19:51.151 --> 00:19:53.520
The way it feels is that time is actually slowing down.

306
00:19:53.880 --> 00:19:57.240
I think the first time that I ever experienced that was in a car crash,

307
00:19:57.270 --> 00:19:58.500
not a bad car crash,

308
00:19:58.620 --> 00:20:02.850
but I was in a car crash and it seemed like things were moving in slow motion

309
00:20:02.970 --> 00:20:05.220
and I wasn't driving,
I was just a passenger,
but I was,

310
00:20:05.490 --> 00:20:10.360
that's the first time I ever felt it.
Um,
and then the other thing I'd,

311
00:20:10.370 --> 00:20:12.720
so you can,
you can be expecting that,

312
00:20:12.810 --> 00:20:16.170
be expecting if you're going into combat that you might have that slow motion

313
00:20:16.171 --> 00:20:20.630
and it's actually an awesome thing because you can feel like you can,
I dunno,

314
00:20:20.670 --> 00:20:22.980
to me it didn't feel like I was moving slow.

315
00:20:23.220 --> 00:20:26.580
It always felt like things were moving slow and I could still,

316
00:20:26.730 --> 00:20:28.380
it gave me more time to react.

317
00:20:28.381 --> 00:20:32.190
It's like if you're doing Jujitsu and your opponent was moving in slow motion,

318
00:20:32.191 --> 00:20:35.880
but even though you weren't,
even though you couldn't move faster than them,

319
00:20:35.881 --> 00:20:39.560
you could see it and react to it properly.
Does that make sense?
Yeah.

320
00:20:40.860 --> 00:20:44.760
And then the other thing is if you notice the fear,

321
00:20:44.761 --> 00:20:46.380
he's saying that he didn't have time to be afraid,

322
00:20:46.381 --> 00:20:49.840
which is definitely something I've felt were like once rounds are being shot,

323
00:20:49.841 --> 00:20:52.510
you're not thinking,
oh,
I'm going to get shot.
You're thinking,
okay,
we need to,

324
00:20:52.540 --> 00:20:54.160
we need to get on mine.
We need to peel,
right?
We need to,

325
00:20:54.220 --> 00:20:56.350
we need to make a call as opposed to,

326
00:20:56.351 --> 00:20:58.630
and what did that that's based on in my opinion,

327
00:20:58.870 --> 00:21:02.920
is training and if you train properly,
then you just react.
That just,

328
00:21:02.980 --> 00:21:05.650
that's just what happens.
And this is why,
and you heard me say this at the,

329
00:21:05.651 --> 00:21:08.710
at the muster,
when was talking about like from a self defense perspective,

330
00:21:09.690 --> 00:21:13.240
for females that are doing Jujitsu for the first time,
I'm like,
Hey,

331
00:21:13.241 --> 00:21:14.680
if you've never done Jujitsu before,

332
00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:19.800
you're about to see that this is about as intimate as a sport or or this about

333
00:21:21.731 --> 00:21:26.731
as intimate as an activity you can possibly engage in without actually taking it

334
00:21:28.151 --> 00:21:31.780
to the next level,
right.
Without actually having yes.

335
00:21:31.900 --> 00:21:36.880
Without being married to the other person.
Right.
So and,
and that's the thing.

336
00:21:36.881 --> 00:21:39.910
If you get used to that,
you get used to somebody grinding on you,

337
00:21:39.911 --> 00:21:43.540
get used to someone grabbing you.
And once you get used to it,

338
00:21:43.541 --> 00:21:45.490
then you don't have to deal with that in the moment.

339
00:21:45.491 --> 00:21:47.230
Cause you already know how to deal with it.
You can just react.

340
00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:49.840
So it's the same thing here.
These guys have trained really hard.

341
00:21:49.841 --> 00:21:52.330
And so now once the situation is unfolding,

342
00:21:52.630 --> 00:21:55.660
what they're doing is just reacting to it as they should.

343
00:21:56.470 --> 00:21:59.100
They're not sitting there panicking and getting,
getting shared.

344
00:21:59.260 --> 00:22:03.040
Not that everyone's going to be like that because you will have some people that

345
00:22:03.041 --> 00:22:04.180
will immediately get that,

346
00:22:04.590 --> 00:22:07.630
that fight or flight and they might roll into the flight scenario of getting

347
00:22:07.631 --> 00:22:11.090
down in hiding.
And so you might have to deal with that a little bit,
um,

348
00:22:11.140 --> 00:22:13.960
but be ready for any of those reactions.

349
00:22:15.190 --> 00:22:16.240
So now the first,

350
00:22:16.270 --> 00:22:19.060
once they get through this first big kind of firefight going on,

351
00:22:19.090 --> 00:22:21.100
now we're going back to the book the guys were digging in.

352
00:22:21.130 --> 00:22:22.510
I told them to set up the guns,

353
00:22:22.511 --> 00:22:25.090
but we'd be covering our section with rifles that night.

354
00:22:25.750 --> 00:22:29.020
We were all wired after our first fire fight and it was good that we had

355
00:22:29.021 --> 00:22:31.830
something to do.
I was happy to see that every bone,

356
00:22:31.870 --> 00:22:34.000
everybody was digging in with a sense of urgency.

357
00:22:35.140 --> 00:22:38.320
I was worried about our open flank to the right.

358
00:22:38.590 --> 00:22:41.650
I ordered the section to dig in some positions facing to the right in case we

359
00:22:41.651 --> 00:22:44.500
had to occupy them.
When we were done,

360
00:22:44.680 --> 00:22:48.430
I told my guys to eat and rest while they got with Walsh and gray

361
00:22:50.110 --> 00:22:53.620
word is the North Koreans were attacking that night.

362
00:22:55.240 --> 00:22:58.690
So
the most of the,

363
00:22:58.990 --> 00:23:02.860
you'll see throughout this book that the North Koreans and then eventually the

364
00:23:02.861 --> 00:23:05.590
Chinese,
they do their attacks during the night.
That's what they do.

365
00:23:05.591 --> 00:23:07.590
And that's how they roll.
They're there on,

366
00:23:07.591 --> 00:23:11.560
if you remember even t Fred Harvey was talking about when he was doing the

367
00:23:11.561 --> 00:23:13.000
island happy hopping and campaign.

368
00:23:13.850 --> 00:23:17.770
They was Americans moving in the day and then at night the Japanese would
attack.

369
00:23:17.800 --> 00:23:21.700
So similar situation here now it's actually the opposite against the enemy

370
00:23:21.701 --> 00:23:24.610
because we have,
you know,
we have night vision capabilities,

371
00:23:24.611 --> 00:23:28.150
we have a huge advantage at night.
So that's when we normally work in and,
and,

372
00:23:28.390 --> 00:23:31.660
and in the seal teams.
That's the way,
that's the way we always worked.

373
00:23:31.720 --> 00:23:32.860
We always worked at night.

374
00:23:32.920 --> 00:23:36.220
Now when we got to Ramadi and it was a lot of daytime fighting.

375
00:23:36.230 --> 00:23:39.730
We had to fight in the day.
But the preferred thing is to fight at night.

376
00:23:39.731 --> 00:23:42.130
And that goes back to the seals in Vietnam.

377
00:23:42.280 --> 00:23:45.590
And if you remember Roger Hayden,

378
00:23:45.591 --> 00:23:49.880
I think it was Roger Hayden was saying when they were going out at night,

379
00:23:50.150 --> 00:23:51.320
no one else was going out at night.

380
00:23:51.321 --> 00:23:53.810
It was just like seals and going out at night.
But other than that,

381
00:23:53.811 --> 00:23:58.070
it was only the Vietcong that were going out at night and the Nva who's but

382
00:23:58.071 --> 00:24:02.150
friendly forces just just seals.
And I know there's other,
there's other ones,

383
00:24:02.151 --> 00:24:03.980
but he was saying early on it was them.

384
00:24:06.230 --> 00:24:09.170
So now the attack comes here.
We go back to the book.

385
00:24:09.171 --> 00:24:11.360
The attack started with a guttural scream.

386
00:24:12.530 --> 00:24:15.350
The North Koreans came out of the brush in waves.

387
00:24:15.500 --> 00:24:17.540
We could see them moving toward us like shadows.

388
00:24:17.660 --> 00:24:20.210
Muzzle flashes exploded out of the darkness.

389
00:24:20.990 --> 00:24:23.060
There was very little aimed fire.

390
00:24:23.390 --> 00:24:27.860
Instead we were firing straight ahead and into their assigned to zones.

391
00:24:28.490 --> 00:24:31.640
Soon screams came from our wounded,

392
00:24:32.270 --> 00:24:37.270
joined the chorus of battle cries orders and machine guns illuminating rounds

393
00:24:38.871 --> 00:24:43.460
from our mortar section soon lit up the area like a ballpark making the North

394
00:24:43.460 --> 00:24:46.040
Korean soldiers look like silhouettes on a firing range.

395
00:24:46.850 --> 00:24:49.640
We dropped several before the flare burned out.

396
00:24:50.630 --> 00:24:52.400
Since the rounds were in short supply,

397
00:24:52.550 --> 00:24:57.260
the mortars waited several minutes between rounds during a lull.

398
00:24:57.500 --> 00:25:02.060
I could hear one of the engineers to our left screaming in pain and calling for

399
00:25:02.061 --> 00:25:02.894
his mother.

400
00:25:04.310 --> 00:25:08.810
His saabs and screams for help landed harder than the North Korean artillery

401
00:25:08.811 --> 00:25:13.010
shells.
Finally,
Private Jones,

402
00:25:13.130 --> 00:25:15.950
one of my young smart asses,
had heard enough.

403
00:25:16.670 --> 00:25:18.260
He started to yell and scream.

404
00:25:19.640 --> 00:25:22.670
I covered Walsh as he scrambled out to Jones.

405
00:25:23.600 --> 00:25:28.430
He was on the bottom of halls.
Whole crying walls,
tried to get him up,

406
00:25:28.431 --> 00:25:30.920
but he wouldn't move.
I climbed out and helped.

407
00:25:30.921 --> 00:25:34.760
Waltzed dragged Jones his ass out of the foxhole.
You stay with hall.

408
00:25:34.820 --> 00:25:37.910
I told Walsh snatching Jones by his shirt color.

409
00:25:38.030 --> 00:25:40.040
I stumbled with him back to my foxhole.

410
00:25:40.130 --> 00:25:44.030
He crawled in and huddled against the wall sobbing.
He couldn't talk.

411
00:25:44.150 --> 00:25:48.560
Even when I asked him a simple question.
His body heaved with every sob.

412
00:25:48.860 --> 00:25:53.210
The engineer had finally stopped screaming and now in an ever desperate voice,

413
00:25:53.330 --> 00:25:54.920
pleaded for someone to come get him.

414
00:25:57.410 --> 00:25:59.630
Stay in your holes.
I barked.

415
00:26:01.070 --> 00:26:03.080
I was sure the North Koreans were lying in wait,

416
00:26:03.110 --> 00:26:07.510
hoping someone would try and get him.
God,

417
00:26:07.511 --> 00:26:08.920
I wished he would just die.

418
00:26:11.750 --> 00:26:16.370
That fought,
sent a jolt through me.
Jesus Christ.

419
00:26:16.371 --> 00:26:18.740
I didn't really mean that,
that poor son of a bitch.

420
00:26:19.840 --> 00:26:20.210
<v 1>Okay.</v>

421
00:26:20.210 --> 00:26:24.650
<v 0>My only thought now was pleased.
God bring the daylight soon.</v>

422
00:26:26.890 --> 00:26:29.970
I mean the sun's rays finally peaked over the horizon.

423
00:26:30.360 --> 00:26:32.880
We started getting the wounded off the hill.

424
00:26:38.680 --> 00:26:41.740
So there you go.
Like I said,

425
00:26:42.490 --> 00:26:45.770
there's some people that are not gonna react well and,

426
00:26:45.910 --> 00:26:50.910
and you got this kid Jones that can't handle this situation and he's done.

427
00:26:51.600 --> 00:26:53.850
He's done.
What does this night too,

428
00:26:54.120 --> 00:26:58.890
he's done and I mean obviously it doesn't help when you got to one of your
wound,

429
00:26:58.900 --> 00:27:03.900
you guys out just ahead of you and he's screaming for help and crying for help

430
00:27:04.980 --> 00:27:09.690
and you can't do anything.
And the order from Richardson,
which is,

431
00:27:09.760 --> 00:27:12.720
you know,
stay in your halls.
And again,
this is the same exact thing.

432
00:27:12.721 --> 00:27:17.721
The Ti Fred Harvey talked about when they'd captured one of his guys and they,

433
00:27:17.880 --> 00:27:22.500
the Japanese sat and tortured him.
It sounded like 30 40 meters away.

434
00:27:22.620 --> 00:27:27.240
They tortured this guy the whole night and the whole night t Fred Harvey's,

435
00:27:27.480 --> 00:27:31.680
you know,
leaders were saying,
stay in your home,
stay in your holes,
were staying.

436
00:27:32.590 --> 00:27:36.510
What?
What a what a nightmare.
That is.

437
00:27:42.850 --> 00:27:47.290
Back to the book.
Walsh grabbed me and here's what says,
sarge black lost it.

438
00:27:47.890 --> 00:27:52.180
He's crying.
He's hugging a tree and will not respond to me black.

439
00:27:52.510 --> 00:27:56.200
I didn't know him very well.
He was one of the company's problem children.

440
00:27:56.380 --> 00:27:59.890
He'd gotten drunk after a unit picnic at Fort Devins in the military.

441
00:27:59.891 --> 00:28:02.230
Police had locked him up for being drunk and disorderly.

442
00:28:03.010 --> 00:28:06.220
This incident confirmed that at w what I follow already,

443
00:28:06.670 --> 00:28:08.920
black was going to be a constant problem.

444
00:28:09.790 --> 00:28:14.140
I put them in Walsh's squad and we both kept on his ass making sure he was doing

445
00:28:14.141 --> 00:28:18.910
the right thing.
When I got to black,
he was wrapped around a tree like a vine.

446
00:28:19.180 --> 00:28:22.780
Every time a shell landed nearby,
he began shaking and crying.

447
00:28:23.920 --> 00:28:25.360
No talking was going to help.

448
00:28:25.660 --> 00:28:28.180
I just wanted to get him away from the rest of the men.

449
00:28:29.270 --> 00:28:33.010
The section had fought well,
but after listening to the engineer all night,

450
00:28:33.760 --> 00:28:36.850
they had their own nerves to continue to contend with.

451
00:28:38.950 --> 00:28:39.783
<v 2>Okay.</v>

452
00:28:39.990 --> 00:28:44.940
<v 0>That made two men within 24 hours.
If this continued,</v>

453
00:28:44.941 --> 00:28:48.960
I would lose the whole section to fear instead of the enemy.

454
00:28:52.370 --> 00:28:55.560
Yeah.
So two guys gone to,
you guys can't any,

455
00:28:55.600 --> 00:28:57.890
and he's ends up sending him to the rear because he just can't,

456
00:28:57.920 --> 00:29:01.010
he can't do anything with this guy.
And that's a tough call to make.
Hey,

457
00:29:01.011 --> 00:29:02.120
if I send this guy to the rear,

458
00:29:02.180 --> 00:29:03.860
how's that gonna Affect everyone else on the team?

459
00:29:03.980 --> 00:29:06.610
Everyone else on the team who's going to be thinking,
you know,
oh,

460
00:29:06.611 --> 00:29:09.920
all I need to do is cry and scream and I'll get,
I'll save my ass.

461
00:29:12.580 --> 00:29:15.820
So you know,
in my opinion,
there's this,

462
00:29:16.660 --> 00:29:20.080
if you're in these situations,
I think

463
00:29:21.670 --> 00:29:25.630
if you're scared to die,
it's going to be a problem.
If you're scared to die,

464
00:29:25.631 --> 00:29:30.580
it's going to be a problem.
If you basically accept the fact that you,

465
00:29:31.300 --> 00:29:35.260
you could die and,
and you're okay with that,
that's how you,

466
00:29:35.590 --> 00:29:38.740
that's to me,
that's a different screen.
These two guys and everyone else,

467
00:29:38.950 --> 00:29:42.190
everyone else was like,
okay,
do they want to die?
I'm not saying they want to die,

468
00:29:42.370 --> 00:29:46.500
but they recognize they can die and they're okay with it.
You know,

469
00:29:47.080 --> 00:29:51.030
maybe,
okay,
was this a strong word?
They accept it,
I should say.
They accept it.

470
00:29:51.550 --> 00:29:54.400
Whereas these two guys are scared and if you're scared to die,

471
00:29:55.330 --> 00:29:56.380
then I think this is,

472
00:29:56.410 --> 00:29:59.050
this is the kind of thing that happens because obviously if you're,

473
00:29:59.080 --> 00:30:00.310
if you're like,
okay,
you know what,

474
00:30:00.311 --> 00:30:05.170
there's a chance I could die and that's the way it is and I'm willing to take

475
00:30:05.171 --> 00:30:07.840
that chance and I'm gonna do my best.
Like that's one attitude.

476
00:30:08.140 --> 00:30:13.140
The other attitude is I don't want to die and here I am in a situation where

477
00:30:13.691 --> 00:30:18.220
death is everywhere around me and that just closes it on your brain,

478
00:30:18.540 --> 00:30:22.930
right?
That just closed in on your brain.
I can't like,
I can't imagine,

479
00:30:22.931 --> 00:30:24.580
I can't imagine how that would,

480
00:30:25.270 --> 00:30:28.690
how that would affect you psychologically if you are scared of scared of dying.

481
00:30:28.691 --> 00:30:32.560
And again,
I don't want to,
I'm not trying to sound like,
Hey,
I want to die.

482
00:30:32.561 --> 00:30:35.710
Or troops on the front line.
We're like,
yeah,
we don't care if we die.
No,

483
00:30:35.740 --> 00:30:39.760
I'm not talking about that.
But to be able to psychologically say,
hey look,

484
00:30:39.820 --> 00:30:40.960
I could die.

485
00:30:41.230 --> 00:30:45.820
That's one of the possible outcomes here and okay,

486
00:30:46.030 --> 00:30:50.620
I get it and I'm okay with that.
That's different than being,

487
00:30:50.770 --> 00:30:52.660
I don't want to die out if you don't,
if your,

488
00:30:52.750 --> 00:30:56.950
if your main goal is to not die and you're in a combat situation or especially a

489
00:30:56.951 --> 00:31:00.760
really,
really violent hardcore combat situation like this,

490
00:31:00.820 --> 00:31:05.260
this isn't gonna work out good for you
at all.
Yeah.

491
00:31:05.450 --> 00:31:08.530
Because it's like when I,
you know,
when I used to work with MMA fighters,

492
00:31:08.800 --> 00:31:11.150
if they were scared of getting knocked out,
yeah.

493
00:31:11.530 --> 00:31:14.350
If that's what they were scared of,
it's really hard to not be,

494
00:31:14.680 --> 00:31:17.770
to go into that cage with any level of confidence because you're scared of that

495
00:31:17.771 --> 00:31:19.750
one thing that might happen.
It's the same thing here.

496
00:31:20.170 --> 00:31:22.600
If you're so scared of that one thing happening,

497
00:31:23.020 --> 00:31:27.960
that's going to possess your brain and even you yet MMA,
even if like you're,

498
00:31:28.370 --> 00:31:31.130
I don't know if you're new to boxing or something,
you know,
and you,

499
00:31:32.190 --> 00:31:36.820
if like you haven't accepted the fact that you're going to get hit every time,

500
00:31:36.821 --> 00:31:40.600
like someone even flip,
you know,
if they throw a faint,

501
00:31:40.680 --> 00:31:42.940
you're reacting to everything.
Right.

502
00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:47.470
So if you're constantly under the kind of the stress.
Yeah,

503
00:31:47.480 --> 00:31:51.170
the stress of like bullets and all this stuff.
It's like you're what we call it,

504
00:31:51.190 --> 00:31:52.780
your self preservation

505
00:31:54.600 --> 00:31:57.940
mechanism in your brain is just firing,
firing,
firing,

506
00:31:58.320 --> 00:32:01.860
and then after a while that thing is just like gone haywire already.
Yeah,

507
00:32:02.130 --> 00:32:05.200
it's gone into overdrive.
That's where it's happening to these guys,
man.

508
00:32:05.201 --> 00:32:09.490
It's horrible.
It's horrible to see.
Yeah.
All right.
Back to the book.

509
00:32:09.491 --> 00:32:12.460
The smoke and dust still hung in the air when they attacked again,

510
00:32:13.600 --> 00:32:16.150
the first waves came with rifles behind them.

511
00:32:16.151 --> 00:32:19.720
More soldiers followed and picked up the weapons left by the dead.

512
00:32:20.280 --> 00:32:23.410
So that's a,
that's a common battle plan.

513
00:32:23.500 --> 00:32:28.500
Where we're going to here is that we've heard it before in other books about the

514
00:32:28.720 --> 00:32:30.640
Korean War.
Hey,
we're going to send the first wave.

515
00:32:30.641 --> 00:32:32.590
They're going to have rifles and magazines.

516
00:32:32.680 --> 00:32:37.570
The next wave is just going to come and pick up the dead guys gear and use that.

517
00:32:38.230 --> 00:32:41.360
So part of the plan is the guy's dying garden.
The planning part of them.

518
00:32:41.361 --> 00:32:46.361
That is absolutely part of the plant and not a small amount either because you

519
00:32:47.061 --> 00:32:50.450
know when you,
when when the military,
when the u s military,

520
00:32:50.451 --> 00:32:51.560
when he plan a big operation,

521
00:32:51.561 --> 00:32:55.370
you plan for casualties and I can't say this about the seal teams.

522
00:32:55.371 --> 00:32:58.820
The seal teams is like,
okay,
like we're going to take this amount of casualties.

523
00:32:58.880 --> 00:33:01.460
The seal teams doesn't do that.
We're not planning to take any casualties,

524
00:33:01.730 --> 00:33:02.990
but like you go with a big,

525
00:33:03.410 --> 00:33:08.240
a big division going in for an airborne drop in World War II,
they were like,

526
00:33:08.241 --> 00:33:12.800
okay,
10% of these folks are going to be injured on the drop.
Boom.

527
00:33:12.801 --> 00:33:17.060
That's it.
So yeah,
and these guys are just saying,

528
00:33:17.600 --> 00:33:20.360
hey,
we got whatever,
300 guys attacking,

529
00:33:20.420 --> 00:33:23.900
we need about 70 guns or whatever that number is.

530
00:33:25.910 --> 00:33:27.830
Back to the book on almost every attack.

531
00:33:27.831 --> 00:33:31.340
The North Koreans tried to slip behind our lines and cut off our avenue of

532
00:33:31.341 --> 00:33:34.340
retreat.
Once they did,
they would pound our flanks.

533
00:33:34.460 --> 00:33:38.030
This time the North Korean soldiers charged up hill right into the teeth of our

534
00:33:38.031 --> 00:33:41.090
machine guns.
After the third attempt,

535
00:33:41.330 --> 00:33:43.850
they quit and we settled in for a tense night.

536
00:33:44.840 --> 00:33:47.630
We waited all night but they didn't attack again.

537
00:33:48.230 --> 00:33:53.230
North Koreans instead went around us and caught off the road back to Taboo Dong

538
00:33:54.530 --> 00:33:57.440
as the fingers and the pink light shot up over the horizon.

539
00:33:57.710 --> 00:34:00.290
We were ordered to withdraw through the Korean line.

540
00:34:01.070 --> 00:34:03.200
This was not going to be easy.

541
00:34:04.670 --> 00:34:08.060
So going back,
so they're getting called back,
hey,

542
00:34:08.061 --> 00:34:13.061
there's a Korean line and they're getting told to fall back past that line.

543
00:34:13.280 --> 00:34:16.160
They got it.
They basically,
they're kind of surrounded even at this point

544
00:34:19.370 --> 00:34:19.941
and here we go.

545
00:34:19.941 --> 00:34:24.941
He kind of expands on what it was like from his perspective and he's,

546
00:34:24.991 --> 00:34:29.000
he talks a little bit about this,
just General Walton walkers mobile defense,

547
00:34:29.001 --> 00:34:34.001
which was hey basically use a thin line of people to sort of sort of hold up the

548
00:34:36.891 --> 00:34:41.060
enemy and then as like a screen and then the bulk of the force would be ready

549
00:34:41.061 --> 00:34:45.650
for a counter attack.
And it was,
it was kind of considered a fury at this time,

550
00:34:45.800 --> 00:34:49.610
but this is what they were trying to do.
And then he says,
for US ground troops,

551
00:34:49.850 --> 00:34:53.480
it was confusing.
This game of chess would become maddening.

552
00:34:53.750 --> 00:34:58.750
I never had a map and seldom knew the number designation of the hills or

553
00:34:59.001 --> 00:35:01.250
objectives.
Now,
that's crazy.

554
00:35:02.240 --> 00:35:04.970
That's freaking crazy and you've heard me say this,

555
00:35:04.971 --> 00:35:07.400
the most important piece of information you can have on the battlefield as a

556
00:35:07.401 --> 00:35:08.240
where you are,

557
00:35:09.170 --> 00:35:13.790
if you don't even have a map and he's a section leader and doesn't have a map,

558
00:35:14.090 --> 00:35:18.320
just Fyi,
like nowadays when we go out,

559
00:35:18.380 --> 00:35:23.380
every single guy has a detailed battle map of the whole area of operations to

560
00:35:23.901 --> 00:35:28.670
think that you have a section leader that doesn't even have a map that's,

561
00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:32.870
that's crazy.
And then the number designations he talks about when you know,

562
00:35:32.871 --> 00:35:36.560
you hear about hill three 48 or whatever,
he doesn't even know what those are.

563
00:35:37.050 --> 00:35:38.820
Back to the book,
we only knew to move,

564
00:35:39.030 --> 00:35:42.720
attack and defend unknown hills that would stop the North Koreans from breaking

565
00:35:42.721 --> 00:35:44.490
through and capturing the city of taboo.

566
00:35:45.690 --> 00:35:50.670
This was our world following orders,
fighting for one another,
being successful,

567
00:35:51.570 --> 00:35:53.070
and somehow surviving.

568
00:35:55.850 --> 00:35:56.683
<v 1>Okay.</v>

569
00:35:57.320 --> 00:35:58.153
<v 0>Now he there.</v>

570
00:35:59.040 --> 00:36:04.040
They're sort of in a little lull in the fighting in one of his guys comes over.

571
00:36:04.250 --> 00:36:08.330
The guy's name is gray.
I'm not feeling very good.

572
00:36:08.420 --> 00:36:09.920
I need to sit down for a few minutes.

573
00:36:09.921 --> 00:36:12.800
Grace said his head was pounding and he felt dizzy.

574
00:36:13.640 --> 00:36:16.370
Try to come over as soon as you can.
Are you going to be all right?
Yeah.

575
00:36:16.371 --> 00:36:20.090
Just give me a few minutes.
When we got to the other side of the ridge,

576
00:36:20.390 --> 00:36:23.150
I turned and looked back at grace sitting on a tree stump.

577
00:36:23.780 --> 00:36:28.550
He had his head in his hands.
Now we know we know what this is a symbol of,
right?

578
00:36:28.551 --> 00:36:31.070
This is a symbol of like a little bit of combat stress happening,

579
00:36:31.310 --> 00:36:32.690
but he's just trying to get it together.

580
00:36:34.010 --> 00:36:37.370
Grain Walsh had been great squad leaders and I hope he was okay.

581
00:36:38.420 --> 00:36:41.030
I needed him to,
I needed him and his leadership.

582
00:36:41.810 --> 00:36:46.280
I had taken off my helmet to wait to wipe away some sweat when gray and the

583
00:36:46.281 --> 00:36:51.281
stump suddenly disappeared in a fireball and artillery round landed right on

584
00:36:52.761 --> 00:36:56.450
him.
I was stunned and just stood on the ridge.

585
00:36:56.451 --> 00:36:58.100
Looking at the smoking crater.

586
00:36:59.870 --> 00:37:03.920
Something happens to men who see combat.
No matter how you try,

587
00:37:04.190 --> 00:37:08.270
you cannot make death invisible.
It is there with you.
Every moment.

588
00:37:09.470 --> 00:37:13.070
That split second would be seared into my mind for the rest of my life,

589
00:37:14.210 --> 00:37:19.070
but at that time we didn't have time to mourn gray.
We had to get in,

590
00:37:19.160 --> 00:37:20.210
start digging.

591
00:37:21.140 --> 00:37:24.560
That round has us zeroed and the barrage will be coming next.

592
00:37:24.561 --> 00:37:28.310
I said grabbing Walsh did haul over and take charge of grey squad.

593
00:37:28.490 --> 00:37:30.440
Tell him I'll be over there to talk to him later

594
00:37:32.620 --> 00:37:35.050
for the rest of the day.
I kept the men busy.

595
00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:39.400
Anything to keep their minds off gray.

596
00:37:39.730 --> 00:37:44.020
So let's think about that again.
You can see,

597
00:37:44.021 --> 00:37:47.470
you can see that Richardson,
he's,
he's legit.

598
00:37:48.730 --> 00:37:52.810
And this is your classic situation where this horrible thing,

599
00:37:52.840 --> 00:37:57.010
you witnessed this horrible thing.
Everyone sees it and what does he say?

600
00:37:57.070 --> 00:38:01.900
Hey look,
this is horrifying.
You say,
oh,
they have a zeroed in.

601
00:38:01.930 --> 00:38:04.870
So where the ref next round is going to hit,
they're going to hit all around us.

602
00:38:05.560 --> 00:38:08.520
So what we need to do is dig in and we needed to do it now and then he just

603
00:38:08.590 --> 00:38:12.160
immediately say,
as hall,
go take over grey squad.
Look Grays gone.

604
00:38:12.370 --> 00:38:16.240
We need to move on.
Tell him I'll be over to talk to him later.

605
00:38:22.790 --> 00:38:23.010
<v 1>Okay.</v>

606
00:38:23.010 --> 00:38:23.671
<v 0>Back to the book.</v>

607
00:38:23.671 --> 00:38:27.870
What drove me more than anything was a positive outlook and the fact that my men

608
00:38:27.871 --> 00:38:30.060
were watching everything I did,

609
00:38:31.170 --> 00:38:33.660
I often wondered when we were moving down the road,

610
00:38:33.780 --> 00:38:34.980
what went through their minds.

611
00:38:35.440 --> 00:38:37.870
This is something that every leader should be thinking about all the time,

612
00:38:38.800 --> 00:38:40.570
is that everyone's watching you,
your,
your,

613
00:38:40.600 --> 00:38:45.070
your boys are watching you and they're judging you.
As harsh as that sounds,

614
00:38:45.071 --> 00:38:48.100
that's what's happening.
So you know what?
Give them a good example.

615
00:38:49.810 --> 00:38:51.220
I'll tell you what,
when I see,

616
00:38:51.250 --> 00:38:56.080
when I would see leaders in the seal teams that didn't act that way,

617
00:38:56.110 --> 00:38:59.780
that didn't act as if they were being watched all the time.
They've,
they,

618
00:38:59.790 --> 00:39:04.630
they usually slacked off.
Like,
what does that look like wearing?

619
00:39:04.660 --> 00:39:09.310
Oh,
it looks like,
I mean,
yeah.
Like,
Hey,
oh no,
I can be a little bit late.

620
00:39:09.310 --> 00:39:12.730
No one's watching.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's a big one.
Like,
oh,
it's okay.
Oh,

621
00:39:12.731 --> 00:39:16.780
I didn't need this piece of gear.
Oh,
I'll cut the corner on this thing.

622
00:39:17.050 --> 00:39:20.170
Just all those little tiny things and not to mention,

623
00:39:20.290 --> 00:39:23.800
but when you're in a situation like this,
when they're watching you and you say,

624
00:39:23.801 --> 00:39:24.634
Hey,
you know what?

625
00:39:24.640 --> 00:39:27.250
They got us dialed in and we need to get Doug and now hall you got,

626
00:39:27.251 --> 00:39:30.740
that's great squad.
Now get to it.
They're watching that too.
Yeah,

627
00:39:31.150 --> 00:39:34.060
and they're seeing and going,
okay,
they're judging and what are they judging?

628
00:39:34.061 --> 00:39:35.050
Their judging positive.

629
00:39:35.320 --> 00:39:38.440
They're judging that Richardson's got his shit together and he's going to take

630
00:39:38.441 --> 00:39:39.274
care of them.

631
00:39:41.350 --> 00:39:42.183
<v 2>Okay.</v>

632
00:39:43.510 --> 00:39:46.480
<v 0>Back to the book.
It had to be a lot tougher on them.
The non me,</v>

633
00:39:47.620 --> 00:39:49.840
while they had only death dwell on,

634
00:39:50.080 --> 00:39:53.980
I had dozens of other things that I must be thinking about and prepared for.

635
00:39:54.130 --> 00:39:57.400
What was ahead?
Where would I be if I were a North Korean?

636
00:39:57.850 --> 00:40:01.450
How would I react if we got hit from the right or left?
How was our ammunition?

637
00:40:01.570 --> 00:40:05.500
Water was the bore sighting of the gun's still.
All right.
Where were the men?

638
00:40:05.530 --> 00:40:10.030
Were the men taking care of their feet?
So he's saying this correctly.
So,

639
00:40:10.031 --> 00:40:14.200
but this is a kind of a different twist is you know a lot of times you hear

640
00:40:14.201 --> 00:40:14.561
leaders say,

641
00:40:14.561 --> 00:40:17.050
well I was responsible for all these guys and that was a heavier weight.

642
00:40:17.320 --> 00:40:21.160
But for him he's thinking I was busy with all these other things.

643
00:40:21.161 --> 00:40:24.220
All these other guys had to do is think about the fact that they're about to die

644
00:40:25.090 --> 00:40:27.490
and how that's actually harder on them.
Right?

645
00:40:31.190 --> 00:40:31.610
Z You,

646
00:40:31.610 --> 00:40:36.610
if you go into it with a perspective that everything's for you is harder and for

647
00:40:37.250 --> 00:40:38.180
for everything,
you know,

648
00:40:38.240 --> 00:40:41.810
for me it's harder cause I'm the leader where's his attitude is fantastic,

649
00:40:41.811 --> 00:40:42.644
which is,
look I'm,

650
00:40:42.680 --> 00:40:46.250
I have the luxury of having other things to think about these poor guys.

651
00:40:46.251 --> 00:40:47.600
They're just thinking about,
you know,

652
00:40:47.630 --> 00:40:52.630
them being overrun as opposed to if your attitude was flipped and you were,

653
00:40:54.560 --> 00:40:57.410
you don't think I have it so hard but these guys have it so easy,

654
00:40:57.440 --> 00:41:02.440
they will sense that and that's not going to end up net positive for you.

655
00:41:02.691 --> 00:41:06.380
And you're in your leadership
back to the book.

656
00:41:06.381 --> 00:41:10.010
The next North Korean assault started with screams and machine gun fire,

657
00:41:10.070 --> 00:41:14.810
but we beat it back with mortars in our own machine gun fire running between

658
00:41:14.811 --> 00:41:17.990
holes.
I made sure everybody was ready for the next wave.

659
00:41:18.170 --> 00:41:22.100
Walsh had his section up and ready to fire halls all also ready,

660
00:41:22.101 --> 00:41:25.550
which was impressive.
Impressive.
Since he had just taken over from gray.

661
00:41:26.480 --> 00:41:28.070
The second attack was worse.

662
00:41:28.760 --> 00:41:33.740
The North Koreans were less than 50 yards from us.
As I fired it,

663
00:41:33.741 --> 00:41:37.880
the shadow is moving toward us.
I heard a frantic voice come over the radio.

664
00:41:38.360 --> 00:41:41.690
Roy Rogers three the voice said in a deep southern draw,

665
00:41:42.020 --> 00:41:46.340
I need more firepower.
I need more fire power.
I'm about to get overrun.

666
00:41:46.460 --> 00:41:49.850
It was Lieutenant Jim Brown from the bell tune that was on our left,

667
00:41:50.540 --> 00:41:54.800
I hope to hell he got more fire support.
We were all hanging by a thread.

668
00:41:56.820 --> 00:42:00.770
Dead North Korean soldiers were stacking up in front of our fox holes,

669
00:42:00.930 --> 00:42:04.170
but they kept coming.
Wave after wave,

670
00:42:05.640 --> 00:42:08.520
I could hear Walsh screaming at the men to stay in their holes.

671
00:42:09.120 --> 00:42:11.520
I was frantically changing the magazine in my car,

672
00:42:11.521 --> 00:42:14.880
being as to the North Koreans were within 10 feet of me.

673
00:42:16.200 --> 00:42:17.940
Walsh and hall saw them too,

674
00:42:18.090 --> 00:42:20.700
and open fire cutting the North Korean soldiers down.

675
00:42:21.900 --> 00:42:24.210
I saw another North Korean to my right and fired.

676
00:42:24.390 --> 00:42:26.460
He staggered back and drop to the ground.

677
00:42:27.690 --> 00:42:31.260
I stayed low and my foxhole and kept firing straight ahead.

678
00:42:31.620 --> 00:42:35.460
Hall and Walsh kept firing to the rear,
hitting the North Koreans,

679
00:42:35.461 --> 00:42:38.130
attempting to move through our position.

680
00:42:39.210 --> 00:42:43.410
We had them in a crossfire and in minutes our position was littered with North

681
00:42:43.410 --> 00:42:44.243
Korean bodies,

682
00:42:45.270 --> 00:42:50.040
sliding a fresh magazine into my car being I poked my head up waiting for the

683
00:42:50.041 --> 00:42:52.620
next wave,
but it never came.

684
00:42:54.860 --> 00:42:59.270
Stay alert.
Some of them may still be alive if you,
if you see any movement,

685
00:42:59.420 --> 00:43:00.253
shoot them.

686
00:43:02.020 --> 00:43:04.540
We waited a few minutes and find the climbed out.

687
00:43:05.720 --> 00:43:06.160
<v 1>Okay,</v>

688
00:43:06.160 --> 00:43:08.590
<v 0>check around your holes for live Koreans</v>

689
00:43:13.370 --> 00:43:17.240
and he goes on to say that we dragged the rest of the body's away from our

690
00:43:17.241 --> 00:43:20.150
position and piled them to one side.
I didn't even look at their faces,

691
00:43:20.360 --> 00:43:21.230
I didn't care.

692
00:43:22.100 --> 00:43:26.150
And he talks about the fact that his medics would try and take care of the North

693
00:43:26.150 --> 00:43:30.810
Korean wounded soldiers.
That's pretty impressive.
Back to the book.

694
00:43:30.811 --> 00:43:33.150
As daylight peeked over its head over the hills,

695
00:43:33.151 --> 00:43:36.750
a tall scrubby looking infantry man carrying a car being approached me from out

696
00:43:36.751 --> 00:43:39.090
of the mist.
As he got closer,

697
00:43:39.540 --> 00:43:42.210
I saw the small white cross painted on his helmet.

698
00:43:43.660 --> 00:43:47.830
He stuck out his hand as he approached chaplain coupon.
He said,

699
00:43:48.160 --> 00:43:50.620
given me a firm handshake.
Where are you from?

700
00:43:51.580 --> 00:43:54.070
Chaplain Amil coupon from Pilsen.

701
00:43:54.100 --> 00:43:58.270
Kansas was a catholic father who joined the army toward the end of World War II.

702
00:43:58.570 --> 00:44:02.620
He served in Burma in India until May,

703
00:44:02.620 --> 00:44:05.950
1946 he returned home and was assigned a parish in Kansas,

704
00:44:07.090 --> 00:44:09.190
but he felt his calling was with the troops,

705
00:44:09.191 --> 00:44:13.420
so he rejoined the army in 1948 he joined us in Korea.

706
00:44:13.421 --> 00:44:15.100
After spending a few months in Japan,

707
00:44:15.310 --> 00:44:18.790
his uniform was dirty and he like the rest of us needed a shave.

708
00:44:19.420 --> 00:44:23.140
It was clear he'd spent the night up close to the fighting and not safely in the

709
00:44:23.141 --> 00:44:23.974
rear.

710
00:44:24.700 --> 00:44:28.150
There was a peacefulness about him though that put me at ease,

711
00:44:28.360 --> 00:44:29.440
a quiet confidence.

712
00:44:29.620 --> 00:44:33.870
He seemed to care where I was from and I watched him as he spoke to the rest of

713
00:44:33.871 --> 00:44:34.704
this section.

714
00:44:35.640 --> 00:44:39.180
Each time he asked a soldier where he was from and gave him a firm handshake.

715
00:44:39.900 --> 00:44:42.150
It was not long before he had us all smiling.

716
00:44:43.170 --> 00:44:45.750
When coupon finished making his rounds,

717
00:44:45.751 --> 00:44:49.870
he sat down near my foxhole and took out his pipe.
It was missing most of it.

718
00:44:49.871 --> 00:44:54.780
Stem.
What happened?
Your pipe?
I asked as he filled it,
a sniper.

719
00:44:54.781 --> 00:44:59.160
He said,
shot it out of my mouth.
A few days ago,
we both had a laugh.

720
00:45:00.870 --> 00:45:03.030
I noticed the car been laying across his lap.

721
00:45:03.450 --> 00:45:07.470
I thought chaplains couldn't carry a weapons.
He smiled and nodded.

722
00:45:07.770 --> 00:45:11.340
If they're going to shoot at me,
how I'm going to be ready to shoot back.

723
00:45:15.290 --> 00:45:17.390
My section was down to eight men.

724
00:45:18.530 --> 00:45:20.720
We received two replacements.

725
00:45:20.990 --> 00:45:25.250
They showed up with their gear and clean uniforms.
One was named,

726
00:45:25.251 --> 00:45:28.550
Jackson's one was named Jackson,
but I didn't catch the other's name.

727
00:45:28.700 --> 00:45:32.870
Jackson had a lot of questions about the North Koreans and where we were on the

728
00:45:32.871 --> 00:45:37.040
line.
Stay close to your foxhole partner and listened to him.

729
00:45:37.041 --> 00:45:41.930
I said I didn't see them again until next morning we'd been attacked again.

730
00:45:41.931 --> 00:45:44.510
But this time we were able to keep the North Koreans from our lines,

731
00:45:44.511 --> 00:45:47.810
but not without cost.
Three men were gone,

732
00:45:48.020 --> 00:45:51.710
one missing and two wounded,
including both the replacements.

733
00:45:53.840 --> 00:45:58.160
We were taking casualties every night and soon could no longer hold our
position.

734
00:46:00.350 --> 00:46:03.650
Later that night we got orders to withdraw withdrawing in the daylight.

735
00:46:03.651 --> 00:46:07.160
Was it bad enough?
Now we're going to attempt it at night.

736
00:46:09.070 --> 00:46:09.880
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

737
00:46:09.880 --> 00:46:13.720
<v 0>So couple things.
You're gonna hear a lot about this,</v>

738
00:46:13.780 --> 00:46:18.640
this chaplain coupon and,
well not a lot as you should.

739
00:46:18.960 --> 00:46:19.840
Um,
there's the,
he's,

740
00:46:19.841 --> 00:46:24.370
he's got his own story that needs to be told and about what he did in his

741
00:46:24.371 --> 00:46:25.204
service

742
00:46:26.430 --> 00:46:27.263
<v 1>and then,</v>

743
00:46:28.210 --> 00:46:28.681
<v 0>you know,
but I,</v>

744
00:46:28.681 --> 00:46:33.400
I tried to pull out a few sections about him and then the fact that these guys,

745
00:46:33.401 --> 00:46:37.570
I mean,
they're losing guys all the time.
You get to replacements and they're,

746
00:46:37.750 --> 00:46:41.530
they're gone by the next morning.
That's not a positive outlook on the situation.

747
00:46:41.531 --> 00:46:44.620
So they finally get the orders to withdraw.
And it's funny,
not funny,

748
00:46:44.621 --> 00:46:49.240
but it's interesting that they're actually not looking forward to withdrawing at

749
00:46:49.241 --> 00:46:53.320
night.
You know?
Whereas me,
my instinct is like I'd rather go at night.
Right?

750
00:46:53.350 --> 00:46:58.240
I mean of course.
But you know what,
if you haven't trained that way,

751
00:46:58.330 --> 00:47:00.310
because you can train,
even without night vision,

752
00:47:00.311 --> 00:47:03.580
you can train to operate at night.
You learned that spacing that you need to get,

753
00:47:03.581 --> 00:47:04.750
you learn,
you know,

754
00:47:04.751 --> 00:47:09.751
certain maneuvers that you do at nighttime that are easier at nighttime.

755
00:47:10.090 --> 00:47:14.080
So nighttime is not something to be scared of.
But these guys,

756
00:47:14.530 --> 00:47:17.320
unless you haven't trained that way,
if you haven't trained that way,
man,

757
00:47:17.410 --> 00:47:20.230
I can't even imagine what it's like cause I trained so much in the dark.

758
00:47:20.231 --> 00:47:22.270
I mean when I first got in the seal teams,
we did everything in the dark.

759
00:47:22.271 --> 00:47:25.390
We'd have night vision.
No,
we just did.
We just patrolled in dark how we do.

760
00:47:25.391 --> 00:47:29.110
We had closer spacing.
You learn how to use person silhouette in front of you.

761
00:47:29.320 --> 00:47:31.930
You're,
you learn how to adapt your eyes to the dark.

762
00:47:32.760 --> 00:47:37.000
So there's all these things that you can do to make you a more formidable night

763
00:47:37.001 --> 00:47:41.980
fighter.
But if you don't train that way,
you,
you,

764
00:47:42.010 --> 00:47:43.390
you're,
you're in big trouble.

765
00:47:45.820 --> 00:47:49.090
So these guys are starting up their withdraw back to the book.
Let's go.

766
00:47:49.091 --> 00:47:49.630
I whispered.

767
00:47:49.630 --> 00:47:53.170
I was nervous in wanting to get going before another attack while standing by

768
00:47:53.171 --> 00:47:56.380
looked over at me.
Sarge,
that's Johnson.
He's dead.
So he was,

769
00:47:56.440 --> 00:47:59.590
he was kicking a guy on the ground saying,
hey,
let's go.
And he's,
you know,

770
00:47:59.620 --> 00:48:02.980
waltzes SARS.
That's Johnson.
He's dead.
I felt terrible.

771
00:48:03.340 --> 00:48:05.560
It hurts to see another one of my men dead in the mud.

772
00:48:06.310 --> 00:48:08.020
I didn't even know Johnson that well.

773
00:48:08.230 --> 00:48:11.710
He was another replacement replacement and I'd only just learned his name.

774
00:48:12.910 --> 00:48:15.850
The fact that I had a little time to dwell saved me.

775
00:48:16.660 --> 00:48:19.060
Plus I knew that if I showed weakness,

776
00:48:19.120 --> 00:48:23.380
my men might finally give in and feel sorry for themselves and I couldn't have

777
00:48:23.381 --> 00:48:26.080
that.
We needed to stick together.

778
00:48:27.040 --> 00:48:31.210
I became stoic and would remain that way for a long time.

779
00:48:31.810 --> 00:48:36.010
Again,
he recognizes that his guys are looking at them.
There's two points there.

780
00:48:36.011 --> 00:48:39.160
Number one,
he recognizes that his guys are looking at him and if he breaks down,

781
00:48:39.440 --> 00:48:42.430
he's going to cause breakdowns.
And number two,

782
00:48:42.580 --> 00:48:45.610
the fact that he had a little time to dwell.
So what does that mean?

783
00:48:46.150 --> 00:48:47.770
Translate that to your life.

784
00:48:47.830 --> 00:48:52.450
If something goes wrong and you decide you're going to take a break to reflect

785
00:48:52.451 --> 00:48:57.310
on that thing,
it don't do that.
It's better.
That's like get back on the horse.

786
00:48:57.311 --> 00:48:59.590
You know the old saying like you've got to get back on the horse.

787
00:48:59.890 --> 00:49:02.950
That's not only does that help you overcome the fear,

788
00:49:03.610 --> 00:49:06.520
but it's better than sitting around and dwelling on it.
You know?

789
00:49:06.580 --> 00:49:09.130
Even if it's something not physical that you're physically afraid of,

790
00:49:09.670 --> 00:49:14.520
still don't sit around and dwell.
That's a bad,
that's a bad thing.
Yeah.

791
00:49:14.980 --> 00:49:19.150
Like are you saying need he gives you?
Yeah.
Like you,
something happens,
right?

792
00:49:19.210 --> 00:49:20.200
Girl breaks up with you

793
00:49:22.240 --> 00:49:24.940
and you take the day off from work.

794
00:49:25.880 --> 00:49:29.050
When we get to sit down and look at the pillow that she necessarily

795
00:49:30.860 --> 00:49:34.930
going to jam you up way more that you go to work and you know your mind's

796
00:49:34.931 --> 00:49:38.230
occupied all these tasks and you know you don't have time to dwell.

797
00:49:38.320 --> 00:49:42.820
And meanwhile I'll say this,
your mind is still processing it,
right?

798
00:49:42.821 --> 00:49:46.000
It's not like,
it's not like you're at work and so you're not thinking about it.

799
00:49:46.001 --> 00:49:49.210
It's in the back and it's getting worked through.
Your mind is doing its job,

800
00:49:49.211 --> 00:49:53.200
kind of getting a grip on the situation and then you get home and like instead

801
00:49:53.201 --> 00:49:56.650
of just going home,
go train,
go,
you'll go directly to the gym,

802
00:49:56.651 --> 00:49:58.330
you're actually kind of stoke cause you're not,

803
00:49:58.331 --> 00:50:01.150
have that pressure of your girl waiting on you at home to that kind of hurry up

804
00:50:01.151 --> 00:50:02.610
and get home like no,
sorry.

805
00:50:02.610 --> 00:50:06.370
We're trying to get some extra rounds and so go get some extra rounds and maybe

806
00:50:06.371 --> 00:50:09.250
stop by that.
We'll place on the way home,
grab a little bite to eat,

807
00:50:09.490 --> 00:50:13.750
you know with one of your buddies and then go home and when you get home,

808
00:50:13.751 --> 00:50:15.880
clean your room.
You know when you get home,

809
00:50:16.790 --> 00:50:19.390
just finished putting together the bid,
the bookcase or whatever,

810
00:50:19.420 --> 00:50:22.870
do something and now you're tired and now you go to bed.
Meanwhile,

811
00:50:22.871 --> 00:50:23.830
like I said in the background,

812
00:50:23.831 --> 00:50:26.110
your mind's been processing this and you're starting to realize like,

813
00:50:26.111 --> 00:50:27.980
you know what,
it's not actually that

814
00:50:27.980 --> 00:50:29.690
<v 3>big of a deal with that.
She left.</v>

815
00:50:29.970 --> 00:50:34.050
<v 4>Yeah.
Yeah.
You know how it isn't there.
The,</v>

816
00:50:34.051 --> 00:50:36.630
I mean I wonder why this,
I'm sure he could kind of figure it out,

817
00:50:36.631 --> 00:50:41.490
but you know how something like bad or traumatic or whatever will happen and

818
00:50:41.491 --> 00:50:46.491
then the person essentially ignores it or whatever and focuses on work folks in

819
00:50:46.621 --> 00:50:51.570
this book and then people close to home,
our therapist or whatever would be like,

820
00:50:51.571 --> 00:50:55.050
hey,
I'm scared.
I'm concerned cause you haven't like,

821
00:50:55.140 --> 00:50:59.760
<v 3>yeah,
I think there's a dichotomy here.
I'm not talking about burying it,
right?</v>

822
00:50:59.770 --> 00:51:01.200
Yeah.
Yeah.
They're not what I'm talking about.

823
00:51:01.230 --> 00:51:03.300
You still got to contend with it and you know,

824
00:51:03.360 --> 00:51:08.250
at some point I'll write down like the,
the,
the protocol,

825
00:51:08.460 --> 00:51:12.960
the breakup protocol straight up and the,
and even like the death protocol.
Like,

826
00:51:13.030 --> 00:51:16.260
here's what you're supposed to do.
And now in,
in these situations,

827
00:51:16.261 --> 00:51:20.730
they don't have time to do any protocol.
Right.
So,
so this,
to your point,

828
00:51:20.880 --> 00:51:25.440
this can be a problem because if you're in combat and you lose someone and then

829
00:51:25.441 --> 00:51:29.790
you never have the time to set aside and contend with it,

830
00:51:30.120 --> 00:51:32.650
then you get back and now you get back to America and now your,

831
00:51:32.760 --> 00:51:34.890
your family and now you're getting a new job and you're getting out of the

832
00:51:34.891 --> 00:51:36.270
military and you're making,
all this stuff happened.

833
00:51:36.630 --> 00:51:40.740
You never contended with what had occurred.
So yes you are correct.

834
00:51:40.741 --> 00:51:44.970
If you don't ever content with it and face it,
then it can turn into a problem.

835
00:51:44.971 --> 00:51:49.200
Then it turns into what we talked about with Tim Ferriss,
which is they tried,

836
00:51:49.390 --> 00:51:52.620
if you tried to bury it,
you didn't realize it.
It was a seed.

837
00:51:53.310 --> 00:51:56.610
So you gotta you gotta make sure that it's not a seed that's going to grow out

838
00:51:56.611 --> 00:51:58.440
of control in the darkness over there.

839
00:51:58.470 --> 00:52:00.270
You gotta you gotta put the shed some light on it.

840
00:52:00.550 --> 00:52:03.790
<v 4>Yeah.
Cause cause that's how,
right.
Like a lot of the time like,
Oh,</v>

841
00:52:05.280 --> 00:52:08.830
you know,
my girl broke up with,
I don't know,
whatever,
like something traumatic.

842
00:52:08.860 --> 00:52:10.840
And then there'll be like,
hey,
I don't want to think about it.

843
00:52:10.870 --> 00:52:13.270
I want to focus on these other things.
I don't want to think about it.

844
00:52:14.140 --> 00:52:14.690
And they kind of

845
00:52:14.690 --> 00:52:18.920
<v 3>bury it seems like that could have happened.
And that's what I'm saying,</v>

846
00:52:19.010 --> 00:52:20.450
there's a balance that you have to do.

847
00:52:20.960 --> 00:52:24.500
There's a balance because you can't just bury it.
You have to contend with it,

848
00:52:24.710 --> 00:52:25.730
but you want to do it.

849
00:52:26.300 --> 00:52:31.300
What you don't want to do is go overboard and just focus 100% on,

850
00:52:31.851 --> 00:52:34.400
I can't believe that this person's gone.
Whether they died,

851
00:52:34.401 --> 00:52:37.070
whether they broke up with you,
whether they would,
you know what?
I get little,

852
00:52:37.220 --> 00:52:37.671
you know,
it's funny,

853
00:52:37.671 --> 00:52:42.260
I get little warrior kid questions for the warrior kid podcasts of my friend is

854
00:52:42.261 --> 00:52:45.410
moving away.
How can I not be sad?
And it's like the same thing.

855
00:52:45.411 --> 00:52:48.710
Like people are gonna come in and out of your life and you got to learn to

856
00:52:48.711 --> 00:52:50.240
contend with it.
And,

857
00:52:50.900 --> 00:52:55.900
and what I'm saying is don't focus on it a hundred percent remember it,

858
00:52:56.660 --> 00:52:59.540
contend with it,
but don't dwell on it because we know what that gets you.

859
00:52:59.810 --> 00:53:03.830
It gets you just down the de,
the darkness,
the spiral of darkness,

860
00:53:04.130 --> 00:53:05.830
which we don't want to go down.
No,

861
00:53:06.170 --> 00:53:10.460
we don't want to avoid it because then it grows behind your back.

862
00:53:11.000 --> 00:53:11.460
Yeah.

863
00:53:11.460 --> 00:53:13.410
<v 4>Yeah.
Well his situation's kind of different.</v>

864
00:53:13.411 --> 00:53:16.050
That's more of a small picture scenario where where it's like,

865
00:53:16.051 --> 00:53:17.530
I don't have time to dwell on it,

866
00:53:17.810 --> 00:53:18.643
<v 3>guy who'd just,</v>

867
00:53:18.650 --> 00:53:22.730
this just happened to him because right now is the most important things going

868
00:53:22.731 --> 00:53:26.100
on.
And I,
again,
this is where people get

869
00:53:26.100 --> 00:53:30.060
<v 0>jammed up because they never contend with it.</v>

870
00:53:30.120 --> 00:53:34.320
They never mourn properly.
They never go through that process.

871
00:53:34.560 --> 00:53:39.270
And then they look up,
you know,
six months later and they go,
oh,
you know,
I'm,

872
00:53:39.350 --> 00:53:41.820
I'm sad I missed my friend.
It's like,
yeah,
that's okay.

873
00:53:41.850 --> 00:53:43.080
You know what you got to take.

874
00:53:43.260 --> 00:53:47.810
That's why you should be able to take the protocol and just enacted when
there's,

875
00:53:47.850 --> 00:53:49.620
you know like you get home from deployment,

876
00:53:49.621 --> 00:53:53.310
it's like okay we're going through the protocol because we let we know or you

877
00:53:53.311 --> 00:53:55.530
lose a friend,
car accident,
whatever,

878
00:53:55.630 --> 00:54:00.480
whatever situation you want.
It comes time to enact that protocol.

879
00:54:00.780 --> 00:54:01.760
Boom you,
you,

880
00:54:01.920 --> 00:54:06.150
you press play on the protocol and then you go through the motions and that gets

881
00:54:06.151 --> 00:54:11.010
you get you through it
or at least start to get you through it.

882
00:54:11.070 --> 00:54:13.440
Cause there's always going to be there but it's not like you're going to be
like,

883
00:54:13.470 --> 00:54:18.470
oh you're always going to remember but don't dwell.

884
00:54:19.020 --> 00:54:19.853
I don't dwell.

885
00:54:23.500 --> 00:54:24.180
<v 2>Okay.</v>

886
00:54:24.180 --> 00:54:25.480
<v 0>All right.
Going back to the book,</v>

887
00:54:25.510 --> 00:54:30.510
it was another attack and when I say that he's actually talking about there

888
00:54:30.881 --> 00:54:35.881
being told that they are going to attack again and this is coming from his boss

889
00:54:36.821 --> 00:54:40.100
Mccabe.
The entire battalion is going to attack hills.

890
00:54:40.360 --> 00:54:44.020
Five 73 ridges go direct to the top of the hill.

891
00:54:44.260 --> 00:54:45.970
Kay Company will be on the left.

892
00:54:46.210 --> 00:54:48.970
We will move in the center and I company on the right.

893
00:54:49.480 --> 00:54:53.080
We will attack at daylight with no artillery or air support.

894
00:54:55.300 --> 00:54:56.133
The,
I don't like that,

895
00:54:56.300 --> 00:54:59.920
like to know the second and third platoons will attack a breast.

896
00:55:00.130 --> 00:55:03.010
Second on the right third on the left.
Richardson,

897
00:55:03.011 --> 00:55:07.030
we'll follow with the 57 in the center.
The first platoon will be in reserve,

898
00:55:07.090 --> 00:55:11.650
so there's your plan.
Boom.
There it is.
What does a breast mean?

899
00:55:11.651 --> 00:55:14.780
Side by side.
Okay.
Yeah.

900
00:55:16.720 --> 00:55:20.200
And now,
so they're,
they're sort of going through and,

901
00:55:20.250 --> 00:55:24.640
and starting to enact this plan and as they're doing this,
one of his boys says,

902
00:55:24.970 --> 00:55:26.980
Sarge,
we're getting out of here by dark.
Right.

903
00:55:28.340 --> 00:55:29.090
<v 2>Okay.</v>

904
00:55:29.090 --> 00:55:30.740
<v 0>I knew the other men wouldn't speak up,</v>

905
00:55:31.070 --> 00:55:33.290
but I could just look in their eyes and see.
They were scared.

906
00:55:33.680 --> 00:55:35.810
I just hope they couldn't see fear in my eyes.

907
00:55:36.020 --> 00:55:39.650
We're staying here until we get orders.
I said finally answering Walsh and hall,

908
00:55:40.460 --> 00:55:42.530
I spoke up loud enough for the whole section here.

909
00:55:42.650 --> 00:55:45.770
Farther down the hill and mark mortar and artillery fire was heavy.

910
00:55:46.010 --> 00:55:48.710
We could see the North Korean positions and they could see us.

911
00:55:49.610 --> 00:55:53.120
I was hoping we were out of grenade range and too close to their,

912
00:55:53.180 --> 00:55:56.450
to their position for them to put mortar fire on us.
Dude,

913
00:55:56.570 --> 00:56:00.770
what kind of situation are you in when what you're hoping for is that you're too

914
00:56:00.771 --> 00:56:04.640
far for grenade range and to close for mortars?
Wow.

915
00:56:06.070 --> 00:56:09.150
Uh,
uh,
man.

916
00:56:10.180 --> 00:56:12.380
So that just puts you in machine gun range basically,

917
00:56:13.280 --> 00:56:17.960
unless you got some kind of dead space or cover,
but not a good situation.

918
00:56:17.990 --> 00:56:22.460
But you know when that's what you're hoping for.
Outlook is not good.

919
00:56:22.470 --> 00:56:25.600
That's your best sooner.
Soon instead of mortars,

920
00:56:25.601 --> 00:56:28.360
the North Korean soldiers started sending down taunts.

921
00:56:28.720 --> 00:56:32.380
We didn't speak the language,
but each word had a charge.

922
00:56:33.130 --> 00:56:37.060
Silence.
No one talks back.
I whispered and put my finger to my lips.

923
00:56:37.840 --> 00:56:42.220
Not that we knew what they were saying as the minutes and then hours ticked off.

924
00:56:42.221 --> 00:56:46.390
I realized that slowly but surely we were moving back a foot at a time.

925
00:56:47.260 --> 00:56:51.280
A guy would reposition and then the rest of the whole section would go off of

926
00:56:51.281 --> 00:56:54.700
him.
At this rate,
we might be off the hill by the end of the war.

927
00:56:55.540 --> 00:56:58.840
I knew one thing,
there was no way we were staying overnight.

928
00:57:01.490 --> 00:57:02.323
<v 2>So</v>

929
00:57:03.330 --> 00:57:06.030
<v 0>situation happens.
Um,
they start,</v>

930
00:57:06.450 --> 00:57:11.450
they start actually there's a fire firing starts and these guys actually start

931
00:57:11.461 --> 00:57:16.461
running down the hill and then they started receiving small arms fire and then

932
00:57:16.950 --> 00:57:21.480
he rolls into another position and there's a guy in there named Vaillancourt who

933
00:57:22.140 --> 00:57:23.340
was another,
uh,

934
00:57:23.820 --> 00:57:28.740
experienced guy in charge of one of the other sections or one of the other

935
00:57:28.741 --> 00:57:31.710
elements.
And he comes in,
where's the executive officer?

936
00:57:31.711 --> 00:57:33.810
I asked Vaillancourt when I caught up with him,

937
00:57:34.170 --> 00:57:36.510
he was killed along with one of the other platoon leaders.

938
00:57:36.990 --> 00:57:39.720
The company has regrouped and tried to come back up the hill,

939
00:57:39.721 --> 00:57:42.480
but it was ripped apart by heavy mortar and artillery fire.

940
00:57:42.750 --> 00:57:45.870
We lost two lieutenants and two platoons took heavy losses.

941
00:57:52.880 --> 00:57:55.700
So that's,
that continues.
And again,

942
00:57:55.701 --> 00:58:00.650
you got to get this book so you can get these details.
I'm not reading them all.

943
00:58:00.680 --> 00:58:05.680
There's the detailed combat for anyone that's in combat arms of any kind to

944
00:58:07.390 --> 00:58:12.320
order this book immediately because there's so much good information in it that

945
00:58:12.321 --> 00:58:16.730
I'm not covering.
So these guys,
they're retreating from that attack.

946
00:58:16.731 --> 00:58:21.140
They get to like an orchard situation and there's a kernel that's in charge of

947
00:58:21.141 --> 00:58:24.080
the regimen and this Guy Mccabe,

948
00:58:24.800 --> 00:58:26.240
who's the company commander,

949
00:58:26.300 --> 00:58:30.800
he comes up and here we go.

950
00:58:31.740 --> 00:58:35.540
Maccabees kind of talking with and brings Richardson over.
Sergeant Richard,

951
00:58:35.810 --> 00:58:38.300
Sergeant Richardson and his men were the last ones off the hill.

952
00:58:38.301 --> 00:58:41.690
Macka B told Colonel Johnson how your men doing.
The colonel asked,

953
00:58:41.691 --> 00:58:46.570
looking over my shoulder at the men finishing up their letter to Sears that this

954
00:58:46.670 --> 00:58:49.970
little joke that they had made earlier.
Okay,
but very tired.

955
00:58:50.690 --> 00:58:54.230
Johnson nodded and shook my hand.
Try and get some rest tonight.

956
00:58:55.010 --> 00:58:57.950
He started to walk away frustrated with the attack.

957
00:58:58.070 --> 00:59:01.580
I knew this was my chance to speak my mind and the mind of my men.

958
00:59:02.270 --> 00:59:06.050
I wanted to know how many more times we are going to have to climb up a hill.

959
00:59:06.170 --> 00:59:10.670
Only did leave it and fight our way up another.
From my point of view,

960
00:59:10.760 --> 00:59:14.480
we were just getting our asses kicked.
How are we doing?

961
00:59:15.260 --> 00:59:17.120
It seems like we never make any headway.

962
00:59:18.590 --> 00:59:20.750
Johnson stopped sergeant.

963
00:59:21.950 --> 00:59:25.490
You tell your men they did a great job against great odds.

964
00:59:25.670 --> 00:59:28.190
We have stopped the North Koreans main attack.

965
00:59:29.690 --> 00:59:33.830
I turned away and slowly walked back toward the men.
I thought to myself,

966
00:59:33.831 --> 00:59:36.710
how Great Walsh Hall and Higley War,

967
00:59:37.700 --> 00:59:42.320
it was their courage and bravery that held us together.
As I looked at them,

968
00:59:42.980 --> 00:59:44.780
it almost brought tears to my eyes.

969
00:59:45.800 --> 00:59:49.250
Johnson's news had an immediate impact on my section.

970
00:59:49.730 --> 00:59:53.540
We no longer dragged ass.
Instead,
we seemed hopeful,

971
00:59:53.900 --> 00:59:58.460
even optimistic.
So again,

972
00:59:58.550 --> 01:00:03.550
this is a good point that when you're in a leadership position,

973
01:00:04.010 --> 01:00:08.300
you're little words have significant impact and you might not realize it.

974
01:00:08.301 --> 01:00:12.770
And I experienced that a lot with leaders,
not only in combat or in the military,

975
01:00:12.830 --> 01:00:13.460
but I expressed,

976
01:00:13.460 --> 01:00:17.330
I see that with leaders in the civilian sector where they don't realize the

977
01:00:17.331 --> 01:00:21.740
weight that they carry.
And this will even be like the CEO of a company.
We'll,

978
01:00:21.741 --> 01:00:23.180
we'll say something,

979
01:00:23.270 --> 01:00:27.770
maybe it's off the cuff and it's a negative thing and it has a negative impact.

980
01:00:27.860 --> 01:00:31.070
But they also don't realize how positive it can be when they say something

981
01:00:31.071 --> 01:00:34.010
positive.
So if you're in a leadership position every once in a while,

982
01:00:34.310 --> 01:00:37.610
every once in a while,
throw out some love to people.
Right.

983
01:00:37.970 --> 01:00:41.730
I'm not saying you don't Lafe likes to use the word false cheerleading,

984
01:00:41.750 --> 01:00:45.380
which is definitely,
yeah,
that's a,
that's a good term.
Yeah.
You know,
which is,
hey,

985
01:00:45.381 --> 01:00:49.550
you've done a great job when you didn't do a great job and cheerleaders,

986
01:00:49.580 --> 01:00:53.750
cheerleaders,
cheer,
pretty much no matter what.
Yeah.
This is what their job is.

987
01:00:53.751 --> 01:00:57.410
They're cheering you.
Hey,
good job.
Even though you're down 47 to zero,

988
01:00:58.370 --> 01:01:02.630
like they don't stop.
Right.
I don't think they just keep,
keep cheering,

989
01:01:02.631 --> 01:01:06.410
keeps hearing.
So I guess you don't even have to say false cheerleader.

990
01:01:06.420 --> 01:01:10.900
You'd just say straight cheerleading.
Well,
oh I guess when they are,

991
01:01:10.901 --> 01:01:13.610
when somebody is winning this,
then it's positive,
right?

992
01:01:13.860 --> 01:01:16.400
<v 4>Yeah.
So,
Hey,
let me ask you this about false cheerleading.</v>

993
01:01:16.420 --> 01:01:18.490
So cause that came up in the muster by the way,

994
01:01:19.130 --> 01:01:23.520
someone thought that it was just like focusing on the positives and not the

995
01:01:23.521 --> 01:01:24.870
negatives.
Then they were like,

996
01:01:24.871 --> 01:01:26.940
that's false cheerleading where they implied that that's what,

997
01:01:27.470 --> 01:01:28.470
and leave it was like,
no,
false.

998
01:01:28.480 --> 01:01:30.300
You're leading is when you're cheering for someone,

999
01:01:31.440 --> 01:01:32.480
even though they're not doing it.

1000
01:01:32.710 --> 01:01:36.520
<v 0>Yeah.
Or,
or making statements that are factually untrue.
Right.
Hey,
echo,</v>

1001
01:01:36.521 --> 01:01:39.730
you did a great job putting out a bunch of videos this last year.
Oh,

1002
01:01:39.731 --> 01:01:40.990
that's actually factually untrue.

1003
01:01:40.991 --> 01:01:43.780
And I wouldn't be able to say that to you because you need to put out a limited

1004
01:01:43.781 --> 01:01:44.930
number of videos.
Yeah.

1005
01:01:45.050 --> 01:01:47.930
<v 4>But if you were to say,
Hey,
those are real quality and not quantity,</v>

1006
01:01:47.931 --> 01:01:50.290
like that would be factored you factually true too.
Yeah.

1007
01:01:50.900 --> 01:01:54.860
Actually technically that's an opinion.
But Hey,
the,
okay,
so what about this?

1008
01:01:54.861 --> 01:01:59.700
He was my question.
So if,
well let's say,
okay,
I'm doing like this,
um,
you know,

1009
01:01:59.780 --> 01:02:04.780
60% of my work load is great and then there's the 40 that's like,

1010
01:02:06.261 --> 01:02:08.030
hey,
you,
you got to change this.

1011
01:02:08.031 --> 01:02:12.800
And then I sorta sorta downplay the 40 ute.
It not me.

1012
01:02:12.801 --> 01:02:17.510
You like my boss downplay the 40 just to encourage me,
whatever reason.

1013
01:02:17.610 --> 01:02:20.040
Um,
and you really up play that

1014
01:02:20.070 --> 01:02:22.830
<v 0>the 60 is that false cheerleading?
It is,</v>

1015
01:02:22.831 --> 01:02:27.831
but there's a little bit more strategy behind this because as your leader,

1016
01:02:28.380 --> 01:02:31.940
I wouldn't only talk to you one time,
right?

1017
01:02:31.980 --> 01:02:33.630
I'm talking to you over a period of time.

1018
01:02:33.840 --> 01:02:38.010
So what my first comment to you might be something like,
Hey,

1019
01:02:38.370 --> 01:02:42.060
echo that 60% that you're over there,
you're crushing it out,

1020
01:02:42.090 --> 01:02:45.660
that you're doing a great job.
Super.
So you know some of the other stuff,

1021
01:02:45.850 --> 01:02:50.220
not quite there yet,
but actually the first time I talked to him I'd be like,
Hey,

1022
01:02:50.221 --> 01:02:52.380
you're,
you're crushing it.
You're doing awesome.
Yeah.

1023
01:02:52.560 --> 01:02:55.260
I might need to mention that 40% because I'm thinking,
Hey,

1024
01:02:55.261 --> 01:02:57.060
if this guy gets encouraged,
he's going to be like,
yeah,

1025
01:02:57.061 --> 01:02:58.390
I'm going to do a little bit more.
Right.

1026
01:02:58.680 --> 01:03:02.460
And yet that you just might pick up the sock anyways on your own accord because

1027
01:03:02.461 --> 01:03:06.540
you're just encouraged by the whole,
the whole positivity that I'm giving you.

1028
01:03:06.590 --> 01:03:10.290
Yeah.
So that's cool.
Right?
Well maybe it doesn't work.

1029
01:03:10.530 --> 01:03:14.070
So now I might have to come just a little bit more direct.
Right?
Hey,

1030
01:03:14.071 --> 01:03:17.250
I noticed that you know this 60% over here that you're dominating and it's

1031
01:03:17.251 --> 01:03:21.540
awesome.
Is there something that with this 40% over here that's different debt,

1032
01:03:21.990 --> 01:03:22.823
you know,

1033
01:03:22.980 --> 01:03:26.760
that date comes to cause it seems to be like a different level and it's not up

1034
01:03:26.761 --> 01:03:29.490
to 60%.
Is there something that's ever been,
maybe I find lard or something,
right?

1035
01:03:29.790 --> 01:03:32.220
But I give you the opposite to say,
well yeah,
it's because of this,
that whatever,

1036
01:03:32.221 --> 01:03:36.690
maybe we can correct it and then if that doesn't work then maybe you have to

1037
01:03:36.691 --> 01:03:41.040
amplify or escalate a little bit more.
Right?

1038
01:03:41.670 --> 01:03:45.750
And then it's,
hey man,
the 60% of that you're doing while awesome.

1039
01:03:47.100 --> 01:03:50.820
There's another,
there's also that 40% that when I'm looking at it,

1040
01:03:50.960 --> 01:03:54.570
I'm actually wondering if it's the same guy because for you to be able to do

1041
01:03:54.571 --> 01:03:59.460
this over here and still kind of throw this in the mix to kind of,

1042
01:04:00.120 --> 01:04:02.430
yeah,
it doesn't make sense to me.
And um,
again,

1043
01:04:02.431 --> 01:04:05.880
my whole thing would be trying to figure out why you're slacking in that area.

1044
01:04:06.220 --> 01:04:08.070
Because if you're doing 60% great,
why are you doing 40 minutes?

1045
01:04:08.730 --> 01:04:10.290
Let's hope there's a reason behind that.

1046
01:04:11.160 --> 01:04:13.680
And so once we find out what that reason is,
it's like,
okay.

1047
01:04:13.920 --> 01:04:18.450
And so I'm going to slowly escalate and start until I get to the point,
you know,

1048
01:04:18.451 --> 01:04:21.320
if we go six months and I've done,

1049
01:04:21.321 --> 01:04:23.130
I've pulled out whatever obstacles in your way.

1050
01:04:23.131 --> 01:04:24.990
Cause there was some obstacles on the 40% was like,

1051
01:04:25.140 --> 01:04:26.730
well we weren't getting that information at a time.

1052
01:04:26.731 --> 01:04:29.230
Okay Watch now I start getting you the information and tough.
And he said,

1053
01:04:29.250 --> 01:04:30.300
well I didn't have the resources.

1054
01:04:30.301 --> 01:04:33.630
Okay well then I throw you another person to help you and you're still slacking.

1055
01:04:33.870 --> 01:04:34.710
So eventually,
you know,

1056
01:04:34.711 --> 01:04:38.100
I'm going to have to come a little bit more direct and be less than man.

1057
01:04:38.340 --> 01:04:41.820
The 60% I appreciate the 40% is actually starting to hurt us.

1058
01:04:42.540 --> 01:04:44.490
And either you need to step it up,

1059
01:04:44.700 --> 01:04:49.020
which is what I'm hoping because I see nothing but potential and you or I'm

1060
01:04:49.120 --> 01:04:51.600
going to actually have to bring someone else in that can kind of handle a

1061
01:04:51.601 --> 01:04:55.500
hundred percent you see where I'm coming from and it would even escalated from

1062
01:04:55.501 --> 01:04:57.240
there.
So.
So,
yeah,
there's,

1063
01:04:57.390 --> 01:05:01.380
I don't think of things as black and white conversations like,
hey,

1064
01:05:01.470 --> 01:05:06.120
I just need to go in and drop the hammer today cause I don't,
I don't,
I'd rather,

1065
01:05:06.240 --> 01:05:10.250
I'd rather have you recognize it.
Right.
I'd rather have you realize that,

1066
01:05:10.470 --> 01:05:12.240
that there's a problem with that 40%.

1067
01:05:12.720 --> 01:05:16.580
Now I might say something and just omit the 40% like when I first talked to you,

1068
01:05:16.630 --> 01:05:18.010
and this is 60% of

1069
01:05:18.010 --> 01:05:20.530
<v 3>this stuff we'll read that you're doing is awesome.
Yeah.</v>

1070
01:05:21.240 --> 01:05:23.530
And I'm giving you the benefit of the doubt that you can straighten out that

1071
01:05:23.531 --> 01:05:27.400
other 40% right?
Get out your ruler and get it straight.

1072
01:05:28.230 --> 01:05:31.830
Syrah.
Of course the ruler.
But so,
okay,
so technically the ass,

1073
01:05:31.831 --> 01:05:36.250
so your whole campaign yeah.
Is not false cheerleading that.
So it's like,

1074
01:05:36.700 --> 01:05:40.510
but let's say you just stuck.
Let's say that for that first one,
that's step one,

1075
01:05:40.540 --> 01:05:42.640
right?
And then you've got,
let's say,
I don't know if I step,

1076
01:05:42.850 --> 01:05:46.540
so if you just stuck with step one,
I guess it depends on the reason to,
right?

1077
01:05:46.541 --> 01:05:48.130
So if I'm like,
Hey,
great,

1078
01:05:48.250 --> 01:05:52.870
this 60% is awesome and don't even mention the 40% because I don't want any

1079
01:05:52.871 --> 01:05:56.240
conflict with that guy,
or I'm scared to,
you know,

1080
01:05:56.540 --> 01:05:58.160
confront them or I'm scared for that.

1081
01:05:58.180 --> 01:06:02.650
That conversation as far as should be realistically scared of is if you're
doing,

1082
01:06:02.651 --> 01:06:06.820
if you're busting your ass to do that 60% great.
And all I come into say like,

1083
01:06:06.821 --> 01:06:09.190
Hey,
this 60% is good,
but the other 40% socks,

1084
01:06:09.730 --> 01:06:13.210
I discourage you and now you're like,
I can't do anything right for Jocko.

1085
01:06:13.330 --> 01:06:14.950
So now you're,
you're not going to get your 60% right.

1086
01:06:14.980 --> 01:06:18.190
There's a good chance that you don't even get the 60% now you're down to 50% and

1087
01:06:18.191 --> 01:06:21.190
then 40% is good and 60% is bad.
I don't want that.

1088
01:06:21.191 --> 01:06:25.390
I want you to be on board with the program.
I want you to be like,
Oh man,

1089
01:06:25.720 --> 01:06:28.300
I could work a little bit more and work a little bit harder,

1090
01:06:28.450 --> 01:06:30.250
discipline myself a little bit better,

1091
01:06:30.460 --> 01:06:33.700
and I could actually get 70% and then let's see what Jocko comes in here and

1092
01:06:33.701 --> 01:06:37.020
says when he's all fired up that I did 60% watch this.
Yeah.

1093
01:06:37.270 --> 01:06:40.270
So this is a whole thing.
So Dang,

1094
01:06:40.300 --> 01:06:45.300
you could almost say almost that false cheerleading,

1095
01:06:47.230 --> 01:06:49.990
I guess.
Okay.
I was going to say,
you could almost say false cheerleading.

1096
01:06:50.170 --> 01:06:52.150
Cheerleading actually has its little spot.

1097
01:06:52.151 --> 01:06:54.550
How does it in a bigger campaign used in a campaign,

1098
01:06:54.551 --> 01:06:57.370
but I guess technically if it is by its very nature,

1099
01:06:57.400 --> 01:07:00.790
if it's part of a big campaign,
it's not false cheerleading,

1100
01:07:00.820 --> 01:07:05.620
it's just this maybe strategics,
Cigi Maneuver,
strategic maneuver.

1101
01:07:05.890 --> 01:07:10.210
Like just think of a little kid.
I mean let's break it down to two.

1102
01:07:10.270 --> 01:07:13.360
The fundamental realities of life as a little kid.

1103
01:07:13.780 --> 01:07:18.280
If you take a little kid that does something,
okay,

1104
01:07:18.370 --> 01:07:23.360
let's say the kid tries to draw a rabbit.
Sure.
And was it look like I'm out.

1105
01:07:23.530 --> 01:07:26.380
It looks like doesn't even living up miles rarely looks like a stick.

1106
01:07:27.550 --> 01:07:32.470
So if you say,
okay,
I'm not going to overuse false cheerleading,
hey kid,

1107
01:07:33.190 --> 01:07:37.000
you're,
that doesn't look like a rabbit.
It looks like a stick fail.

1108
01:07:38.230 --> 01:07:42.910
Is that kid going to draw another rabbit?
It's not going to want to.
If you say,

1109
01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:46.780
oh,
I really liked that you tried,
I can see where the eyes should go.

1110
01:07:47.800 --> 01:07:49.930
You know what I mean?
And they get a little bit and they're like,
okay,

1111
01:07:49.960 --> 01:07:54.790
can I hang this up?
I'm going to hang this up on my refrigerator.
Huh?
Wait,

1112
01:07:55.090 --> 01:07:57.440
what does that kid want to do now?
Draw more.
Yeah.

1113
01:07:58.720 --> 01:08:03.710
Does that translate directly to adults?
Oh yes it does.
Oh yes it does.

1114
01:08:03.780 --> 01:08:06.400
Does it always translate a hundred percent no,
of course not.

1115
01:08:06.401 --> 01:08:08.770
It doesn't translate 100% but because there's some people that are,

1116
01:08:09.070 --> 01:08:11.340
of course there's some people that just trying to skate and do the minimum.

1117
01:08:11.341 --> 01:08:13.570
And if you say like,
Hey,
good job.
You're like,
okay,
cool.
Thanks.

1118
01:08:13.600 --> 01:08:16.310
Right now I'm just gonna keep doing whatever you told me.
But if you're,
you know,

1119
01:08:17.030 --> 01:08:19.250
again,
for an EC strategic,
we're in a campaign,

1120
01:08:19.251 --> 01:08:23.240
we're trying to make things happen.
It's like,
yeah,
you know what?
Hmm.
Hey,

1121
01:08:23.420 --> 01:08:27.630
echo man.
That stuff fixed of the first time you ever made a video.
Yeah.

1122
01:08:27.960 --> 01:08:32.330
Imagine if I said,
you know,
I mean,

1123
01:08:32.710 --> 01:08:36.470
do decent work,
you know,
not exactly I grabbing though.

1124
01:08:36.860 --> 01:08:41.120
Would you have been excited to make more videos pro?
Yeah,
probably not.
Yeah.

1125
01:08:41.330 --> 01:08:44.270
I mean,
you'd probably be like,
oh,
okay,
well,
whatever.

1126
01:08:44.300 --> 01:08:47.440
I guess maybe this isn't for me or maybe I won't make videos for this guy,

1127
01:08:48.680 --> 01:08:52.520
but if I was like,
aw man,
I really liked the way that was some good that was,

1128
01:08:52.550 --> 01:08:56.210
you know what I mean?
Then you go,
oh yeah.
I'm like,
he's in the game with me.

1129
01:08:56.370 --> 01:08:58.250
[inaudible] we're a team.
We're not against each other,

1130
01:08:58.910 --> 01:09:01.640
so I'm just trying to unify things and bring things together.
Yeah.

1131
01:09:01.641 --> 01:09:06.040
I might even come back to you to improve myself more with deals.

1132
01:09:06.800 --> 01:09:08.960
I had the,
yeah,
we're a team now.

1133
01:09:09.160 --> 01:09:12.020
That's a good way to do my best leaders that I had.

1134
01:09:12.140 --> 01:09:15.350
All I wanted to do is do better for them.
They did and they never,

1135
01:09:15.400 --> 01:09:16.790
they might give me critique,

1136
01:09:16.791 --> 01:09:21.350
but it was like the kind of critique that makes you feel guilty about being
alive

1137
01:09:23.040 --> 01:09:26.210
with the alignment.
Really,
really like this.
You know?

1138
01:09:27.890 --> 01:09:31.580
I wish if we could do this a little bit more,
man,
that would be really nice.

1139
01:09:31.581 --> 01:09:35.800
I'm like,
man,
I wish I got better.

1140
01:09:36.260 --> 01:09:38.780
And then you have to also remember that people have different levels of

1141
01:09:38.781 --> 01:09:41.180
sensitivities.
Right?
Cause for you,

1142
01:09:41.540 --> 01:09:45.380
like especially when it's something that they deeply care about.

1143
01:09:45.710 --> 01:09:49.220
When you critique them,
there's almost no one that takes that critique.
Well,

1144
01:09:49.520 --> 01:09:53.060
right.
Oh,
you want to tell me about,
oh,
you want to tell me about whatever.

1145
01:09:53.061 --> 01:09:56.120
I did this drawing like a little kid.
Right?
The kid tries to do good drawing.

1146
01:09:56.430 --> 01:10:00.890
Yeah.
You tell him that the drawings no good.
That breaks their heart.
Yeah.
Yes,

1147
01:10:00.891 --> 01:10:05.420
it does evil.
Yeah,
man.
So you're right.

1148
01:10:05.750 --> 01:10:09.500
Is that false cheerleading?
No.
That's part of a campaign plan.

1149
01:10:09.670 --> 01:10:12.740
Is it good if the kid draws a stick and you're like,

1150
01:10:12.741 --> 01:10:15.260
that's the most amazing drawing I've ever seen.
Well.

1151
01:10:15.261 --> 01:10:17.560
Now what's this is to [inaudible] point,
if you,

1152
01:10:17.570 --> 01:10:19.820
the kid draws a stick and supposed to be a rabbit and you go,

1153
01:10:19.850 --> 01:10:23.780
that's the most amazing rabbit I've ever seen drawn.
Now let me ask you this.

1154
01:10:23.810 --> 01:10:27.860
Is that kid going to try and improve at all?
No,

1155
01:10:27.890 --> 01:10:32.360
and he'll probably not take criticism because they start getting used to like

1156
01:10:32.410 --> 01:10:33.010
never have.

1157
01:10:33.010 --> 01:10:37.970
Everything I do is great and I think that one applies more to adults because

1158
01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:40.460
when you say that to an adult like,
man,
that's the best thing I've ever seen.

1159
01:10:40.490 --> 01:10:44.450
They're like,
AH,
yeah,
they're a little bit more egotistical.
They believe it more.

1160
01:10:44.451 --> 01:10:47.780
Yeah.
Little kids are like,
well,
like kind of surprised if you tell him that it,

1161
01:10:47.781 --> 01:10:50.300
plus they wouldn't really believe you.
They're like,
hey look,
I'm only six,

1162
01:10:50.301 --> 01:10:52.250
but that's the stick as far as I'm concerned.

1163
01:10:52.430 --> 01:10:54.560
I'd tried to make a rabbit like I got,

1164
01:10:54.740 --> 01:10:58.400
I got an ear on there anyways after that.
Don't know.

1165
01:10:59.630 --> 01:11:03.740
I could see that too.
Yes,
so there you go.

1166
01:11:05.270 --> 01:11:10.040
Meanwhile,
back in Korea,
here's what's going on there.

1167
01:11:10.100 --> 01:11:13.160
Under another attack in his,
you can see there's a little pattern developing.

1168
01:11:13.530 --> 01:11:14.100
It's just we're

1169
01:11:14.100 --> 01:11:16.170
<v 0>getting attacked.
We're getting attacked,
we're getting attacked,</v>

1170
01:11:16.171 --> 01:11:17.640
we're getting attacked.
That's what's going on.

1171
01:11:18.330 --> 01:11:20.400
We could see the North Koreans pouring over the hill.

1172
01:11:20.460 --> 01:11:24.090
The North Korean artillery fire followed k company down the hill.

1173
01:11:24.150 --> 01:11:27.150
The ground shook like an earthquake.
As the rounds walk towards us,

1174
01:11:27.270 --> 01:11:29.310
I hugged the bottom of the side of the hole.

1175
01:11:29.610 --> 01:11:32.460
All I could think about was around landing straight on top of me.

1176
01:11:32.610 --> 01:11:34.200
If that happened,
I'd never know.

1177
01:11:34.710 --> 01:11:37.800
I pulled my helmet and gritted my teeth.

1178
01:11:38.800 --> 01:11:40.630
I was starting to lose it.

1179
01:11:43.420 --> 01:11:43.970
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1180
01:11:43.970 --> 01:11:46.210
<v 0>Now again,
this is just continue there,</v>

1181
01:11:46.211 --> 01:11:48.030
continue to get hammered and waltzed comes over.

1182
01:11:48.031 --> 01:11:51.650
He's are we going to stay goddammit to stay in these holes until I tell you

1183
01:11:51.651 --> 01:11:56.120
differently.
I raced back to my whole on the way a young lieutenant ran by me.

1184
01:11:56.360 --> 01:11:59.840
He was scared.
He was so scared.
As voice cracked.
When he screamed at me,

1185
01:12:00.140 --> 01:12:03.440
get Outta here.
Fall back.
Who the hell are you?
I barked.

1186
01:12:03.650 --> 01:12:06.560
There were men still trying to get back and if we left,

1187
01:12:06.590 --> 01:12:08.540
they wouldn't have a chance in hell.
So He's,

1188
01:12:08.630 --> 01:12:12.470
his group is trying to provide cover fire for the groups that are now
retreating.

1189
01:12:12.800 --> 01:12:16.550
He didn't stop and I never got his name.
He just yelled to fall back.

1190
01:12:16.610 --> 01:12:19.580
You're full of shit.
I yelled at him.
We can't leave here.

1191
01:12:19.610 --> 01:12:23.760
We have to help these men.
Yeah,
this is that.

1192
01:12:23.780 --> 01:12:25.580
He's keeping order.
In this retreat,

1193
01:12:25.880 --> 01:12:30.140
several other members of k company past me following the lieutenant,

1194
01:12:30.410 --> 01:12:33.650
I saw some of my men getting out of their holes.
You sons of bitches,

1195
01:12:33.651 --> 01:12:36.680
get back in your God damn holes.
I co I yelled,
get back.

1196
01:12:37.130 --> 01:12:40.400
They scrambled back round,
started to crash around us again.

1197
01:12:40.580 --> 01:12:43.580
I could hear the K company men scream is shrapnel showered,

1198
01:12:43.581 --> 01:12:46.550
them slicing into their skin,
larger pieces,

1199
01:12:46.700 --> 01:12:49.520
punched holes in their chest or sheered off their limbs.

1200
01:12:49.670 --> 01:12:53.510
Their screams filled in the silence between the crashes of artillery shells.

1201
01:12:54.110 --> 01:12:57.530
I was not going to be able to control this fucking situation much longer.

1202
01:12:58.250 --> 01:13:01.070
Walsh just stared at me with a vacant look.
Don't lose it.

1203
01:13:01.071 --> 01:13:05.180
Now I thought another barrage landed nearby.
I put my head down,

1204
01:13:05.420 --> 01:13:09.470
my ears started ringing.
Smoke was down on the bottom of the hole again.

1205
01:13:09.680 --> 01:13:11.870
The artillery fire finally stopped.

1206
01:13:13.100 --> 01:13:16.940
The screaming for the medics began.
Go check your man.

1207
01:13:16.941 --> 01:13:21.290
I told wall shaking him out of his stupor.
I headed over to halls position.

1208
01:13:21.440 --> 01:13:24.620
He had the same vacant look as Walsh men from k company.

1209
01:13:24.621 --> 01:13:26.660
We're moving down the ridge carrying the wounded.

1210
01:13:26.870 --> 01:13:28.880
Everybody was bleeding or bandaged.

1211
01:13:29.570 --> 01:13:33.470
I kept my men focused on the hill waiting for the North Koreans to counter

1212
01:13:33.471 --> 01:13:36.290
attack,
but they never came.

1213
01:13:37.380 --> 01:13:38.720
Neither did the artillery.

1214
01:13:39.500 --> 01:13:42.950
It wasn't long and I was told to withdraw off the hill.

1215
01:13:48.330 --> 01:13:53.330
He talks about the Korean augmentation to the U s army or Cat Catoosa program,

1216
01:13:54.451 --> 01:13:56.340
k a t u.
S a,

1217
01:13:56.910 --> 01:14:00.780
so Korean augmentation to the u s army and this was like soldiers.

1218
01:14:00.781 --> 01:14:01.740
He describes it here.

1219
01:14:02.340 --> 01:14:05.850
Katusa soldiers were young men picked up in larger cities given a couple of

1220
01:14:05.851 --> 01:14:09.630
weeks training and assigned to the American units.
Despite the language barriers,

1221
01:14:09.750 --> 01:14:13.780
the Koreans fell right in with the rest of us.
When we marched.
They kept up.

1222
01:14:13.810 --> 01:14:16.210
When we fought,
they stood their ground too.

1223
01:14:20.790 --> 01:14:21.623
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1224
01:14:22.210 --> 01:14:25.150
<v 0>Over the next few days,
we continued to attack to the west.</v>

1225
01:14:25.151 --> 01:14:27.700
It was a knockdown drag outs.
Slug fest.

1226
01:14:27.880 --> 01:14:31.420
The North Koreans attacked us with abandoned and tried to overwhelm us with

1227
01:14:31.421 --> 01:14:33.310
numbers.
They were fanatical.

1228
01:14:33.430 --> 01:14:37.390
One regimental commander said after the war that the North Koreans had no

1229
01:14:37.391 --> 01:14:39.430
consideration for the loss of life.

1230
01:14:39.610 --> 01:14:44.080
They have no hesitancy in losing 500 lives to gain a small piece of ground.

1231
01:14:46.990 --> 01:14:50.170
It took us three more days to take two more North Korean positions.

1232
01:14:50.440 --> 01:14:55.440
We uncovered large ammunition caches and killed 72 and captured 200 all at a

1233
01:14:57.701 --> 01:14:58.570
great price.

1234
01:14:59.680 --> 01:15:04.120
I lost two more men and the company suffered a total of four killed with 13

1235
01:15:04.121 --> 01:15:08.800
wounded.
The losses reduced our strength to round 53 men,

1236
01:15:11.240 --> 01:15:14.990
but the enemy was now on the run and we held the river river lined.

1237
01:15:15.740 --> 01:15:17.720
The morale went sky high,

1238
01:15:17.900 --> 01:15:21.290
so they kind of turned the tables a little bit as they went on the attack and

1239
01:15:21.291 --> 01:15:22.310
the counter offensive

1240
01:15:24.410 --> 01:15:29.410
and then they're continuing to push and as they're,

1241
01:15:30.950 --> 01:15:33.350
as they're heading down the road,
all of a sudden,

1242
01:15:33.351 --> 01:15:37.580
North Korean machine guns started spraying the road.
They had us in the open.

1243
01:15:38.690 --> 01:15:42.290
The North Koreans had us pin down and unable to push into the village,

1244
01:15:42.291 --> 01:15:44.000
which is what their,
what their objective was.

1245
01:15:45.500 --> 01:15:49.610
I heard the rumbling first peeking over the dyke.

1246
01:15:49.640 --> 01:15:54.640
I saw three Russian made t 34 tanks I could tell they were t 34 is because of

1247
01:15:55.041 --> 01:15:58.640
the narrow turret that sat on top of the almost pyramid shaped body.

1248
01:15:59.810 --> 01:16:04.810
The tanks had led the charge against Nazi Germany in world war two the t 34

1249
01:16:05.211 --> 01:16:08.990
dominated the German tanks because the Russian tanks could race over the deep

1250
01:16:08.991 --> 01:16:13.460
mud and snow of the eastern front.
After the war,

1251
01:16:13.730 --> 01:16:16.520
the Soviets sold them to their communist allies.

1252
01:16:16.940 --> 01:16:21.290
The North Korean invasion was spearheaded by t 34 tanks.

1253
01:16:21.410 --> 01:16:23.780
The North Korean lead tank was almost on us.

1254
01:16:23.990 --> 01:16:28.010
It stopped and the main gun started to slowly turn in our direction.

1255
01:16:29.090 --> 01:16:33.650
I looked at the road and saw a bazooka gunner jump out of the rice patty run to

1256
01:16:33.651 --> 01:16:37.730
the middle of the road,
stop shoulder the tube aiming at the tank.

1257
01:16:37.850 --> 01:16:41.120
I thought this guy must have nerves of steel.
It was a modern day,

1258
01:16:41.121 --> 01:16:43.070
David and Goliath.
Wham.

1259
01:16:44.150 --> 01:16:46.790
The rocket smashed into the tank and bounced off.

1260
01:16:47.240 --> 01:16:50.990
The God damn thing was a dud or the governor was too close in.

1261
01:16:50.991 --> 01:16:54.750
The rockets did not have time to arm a burst from the tanks.

1262
01:16:54.751 --> 01:16:58.680
Machine gun opened up and quickly cut the American gun down.

1263
01:17:00.580 --> 01:17:04.510
I scrambled down the muddy dykes screaming at Hiigli to get the his gun up

1264
01:17:04.690 --> 01:17:07.810
machine.
Gun rounds from the tanks.
Gunner sprayed me with mud.

1265
01:17:08.020 --> 01:17:09.010
Go for the treads I,

1266
01:17:10.640 --> 01:17:15.170
I watched he leads assistant gunner side around into the 57 on his shoulder and

1267
01:17:15.171 --> 01:17:19.760
tap them on the helmet.
I slid to a stop and buried my head in my hands.

1268
01:17:19.940 --> 01:17:23.960
I felt the concussion before I heard the round race by and hit the tank.

1269
01:17:24.170 --> 01:17:27.590
The armored tried to shake off the blast,
but when it moved,

1270
01:17:27.591 --> 01:17:29.810
I watched the tread roll off the wheels.

1271
01:17:30.890 --> 01:17:34.580
The turrets still worked and I could see it move back and forth searching for

1272
01:17:34.581 --> 01:17:37.190
targets,
staying out of the North Korean sites.

1273
01:17:37.370 --> 01:17:41.090
I emotion to Walsh to get his gun on the second tank in minutes.

1274
01:17:41.091 --> 01:17:46.010
I heard another blast from the 57 soon the two tanks unable to get there by

1275
01:17:46.011 --> 01:17:49.580
they're crippled mate reversed and headed back to the village

1276
01:17:53.830 --> 01:17:56.140
just taking out tanks with bazookas.

1277
01:17:59.550 --> 01:18:00.383
<v 1>Unbelievable.</v>

1278
01:18:01.890 --> 01:18:04.350
<v 0>The next morning we started out toward the hill and the village,</v>

1279
01:18:05.100 --> 01:18:09.690
a thick early morning fog hung low over the rice patties.
Visibility was zero.

1280
01:18:09.810 --> 01:18:11.760
We were stiff,
wet,
and very anxious.

1281
01:18:11.761 --> 01:18:15.540
As we started moving toward the objective up ahead,

1282
01:18:15.720 --> 01:18:18.960
I saw soldiers walked through the North Korean positions and continued toward

1283
01:18:18.961 --> 01:18:21.180
the village climbing like the last dyke.

1284
01:18:21.510 --> 01:18:24.330
We ran up on a road covered in North Korean bodies.

1285
01:18:24.450 --> 01:18:29.430
They were in a heap torn apart by shrapnel mules and broken,
broken equipment,

1286
01:18:29.460 --> 01:18:34.380
sat motionless nearby body parts were strewn on both sides of the road.

1287
01:18:34.980 --> 01:18:38.790
I saw men lying dead and still chained to the machine guns they were pulling.

1288
01:18:39.840 --> 01:18:42.900
As the fog lifted,
the site became even more gruesome.

1289
01:18:43.790 --> 01:18:47.370
Our our artillery had caught them trying to withdraw.

1290
01:18:48.570 --> 01:18:51.030
The same scene played over and over again.

1291
01:18:51.240 --> 01:18:53.460
As we moved up the road into the village,

1292
01:18:54.420 --> 01:18:57.660
we didn't face a fight taking this position

1293
01:19:00.580 --> 01:19:03.190
every mile we moved north,
my outlook changed.

1294
01:19:03.191 --> 01:19:07.720
The whole section looked and acted more self confident.
When we got into a fight,

1295
01:19:07.721 --> 01:19:08.554
we enjoyed it.

1296
01:19:08.680 --> 01:19:13.040
The killing was quickly becoming revenge rather than necessity rather than

1297
01:19:13.050 --> 01:19:16.060
necessity to gain ground and drive the North Koreans out.

1298
01:19:16.780 --> 01:19:21.760
We were still being killed only now we were the aggressors and they were dying

1299
01:19:21.761 --> 01:19:22.720
in their holes.

1300
01:19:23.830 --> 01:19:28.810
I knew we were better fighters and had held them under tremendous odds.

1301
01:19:29.290 --> 01:19:33.520
Now the tables were turned and they did not have the will or resolve to

1302
01:19:33.521 --> 01:19:37.360
accomplish what we had in Pusan during the darkest days of summer.

1303
01:19:38.530 --> 01:19:42.400
So the momentum's kind of changed and these guys are feeling,

1304
01:19:42.880 --> 01:19:47.650
feeling good about the whole situation as they,
and there's something good.

1305
01:19:47.651 --> 01:19:49.720
There's something that feels good about being an offense,
right?

1306
01:19:49.930 --> 01:19:52.030
Being an offense is,
is where we want to be.

1307
01:19:52.060 --> 01:19:56.770
We don't want to be on defense and this confidence can't continues as they

1308
01:19:56.771 --> 01:19:58.180
continue to advance.
Early.

1309
01:19:58.181 --> 01:20:01.390
The next morning we were back on foot advancing toward the North Koreans,

1310
01:20:01.391 --> 01:20:04.960
behind the three American tanks.
We were receiving heavy,

1311
01:20:05.110 --> 01:20:07.920
heavy artillery fire and tried to close to the tanks,

1312
01:20:07.921 --> 01:20:11.010
hoping the army root shield us from the shrapnel flying through the air.

1313
01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:12.631
One second,

1314
01:20:12.631 --> 01:20:16.500
I was looking back to make sure Walsh's squad was keeping up and the next I was

1315
01:20:16.501 --> 01:20:17.334
stunned.

1316
01:20:18.090 --> 01:20:21.690
A shell landed on the tank sending shrapnel and fire into the air.

1317
01:20:21.960 --> 01:20:25.050
The explosion was deafening and I stumbled back,
dazed,

1318
01:20:26.280 --> 01:20:28.590
falling down in the tracks behind the tank.

1319
01:20:28.920 --> 01:20:31.920
I saw the crew crawling out of the escape hatch machine.

1320
01:20:31.921 --> 01:20:35.040
Gun fire was kicking up dirt all around me as I hugged the ground.

1321
01:20:36.320 --> 01:20:36.920
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

1322
01:20:36.920 --> 01:20:39.260
<v 0>I could see two tankers lying under the tank.</v>

1323
01:20:39.470 --> 01:20:44.210
They were wounded and couldn't crawl away from the hulk.
Walsh,
I screamed,

1324
01:20:44.330 --> 01:20:48.560
help me get these guys.
A couple of artillery rounds.
Net landed on the road.

1325
01:20:48.770 --> 01:20:53.210
I felt a sharp hot pain in my left shoulder.
You all right?

1326
01:20:53.780 --> 01:20:57.620
Walsh asked as he raced to my side.
Yeah.

1327
01:20:58.370 --> 01:20:59.510
I said shaking my head,

1328
01:20:59.511 --> 01:21:02.360
trying to reassure him I didn't have time to worry about it.

1329
01:21:02.990 --> 01:21:06.530
The machine gun rounds pinged off the armor as I crawled underneath the tank and

1330
01:21:06.531 --> 01:21:10.640
grab one of the tankers by as color pain shot through my arm and my shoulder

1331
01:21:10.641 --> 01:21:14.930
felt hot and week I let go but hung on with my good hand.

1332
01:21:15.170 --> 01:21:19.460
Waltzed grabbed the other tanker and we dragged the pair intuitive nearby ditch

1333
01:21:19.550 --> 01:21:21.470
medic medic.
I screamed.

1334
01:21:23.840 --> 01:21:25.190
So this again,

1335
01:21:25.191 --> 01:21:30.191
there's this like heroism after heroism after heroism in this book and I brought

1336
01:21:31.221 --> 01:21:34.640
bring up some of them but I don't bring up all of them cause we just don't have,

1337
01:21:35.210 --> 01:21:40.040
I'm not going to read the whole book.
You got to buy the book
continuing.

1338
01:21:40.430 --> 01:21:43.550
I squatted down and try to take off my gear and jackets and the medic could get

1339
01:21:43.551 --> 01:21:46.340
to the wound because obviously got hit in the shoulder.

1340
01:21:46.520 --> 01:21:48.740
My left hand show cause I peeled off the shirt.

1341
01:21:48.860 --> 01:21:52.460
Now a few shades darker from the blood.
The medic arrived with Walsh.

1342
01:21:52.580 --> 01:21:56.540
He wiped away the blood with a wad of gauze and started to bandage the Gash.

1343
01:21:57.350 --> 01:22:00.500
It was on the backside of my shoulder and I couldn't see the wound.

1344
01:22:02.510 --> 01:22:06.110
A few pieces of shrapnel,
the medic said,
you can move it right.

1345
01:22:06.980 --> 01:22:08.600
Probably nothing torn or broken.

1346
01:22:12.240 --> 01:22:15.780
So now he's,
you know,
he's wounded,
not too severe.

1347
01:22:17.610 --> 01:22:21.340
Not exactly a good deal though.
You know,
you think about you,

1348
01:22:21.420 --> 01:22:25.410
you think about your neck in an athletic competition,
which is what this is.

1349
01:22:25.890 --> 01:22:28.350
And on top of that,
there's a massive amount of mental stress.

1350
01:22:28.830 --> 01:22:31.920
And on top of that you've got to make decisions.
And on top of that you get,

1351
01:22:31.921 --> 01:22:34.200
you get a big gash in your shoulder.

1352
01:22:36.210 --> 01:22:39.960
A couple of days later,
we were,
we sat overlooking the 38th parallel.

1353
01:22:40.140 --> 01:22:44.640
We'd push the North Koreans back now in a weighted orders to attack sitting in

1354
01:22:44.641 --> 01:22:47.970
my foxhole.
I watched as the full moon began to rise,

1355
01:22:48.240 --> 01:22:51.990
I got the feeling that there was something safe and secure as it washed gently

1356
01:22:51.991 --> 01:22:56.670
over us.
I felt like God was protecting us to,
we're surely trying to help.

1357
01:22:57.000 --> 01:22:58.800
At least he'd kept me alive.

1358
01:23:00.550 --> 01:23:04.840
Even though my shoulder throbbed if only we were back home,

1359
01:23:05.320 --> 01:23:10.320
we could all go to sleep under the moon's calming light and wake up safe to the

1360
01:23:11.321 --> 01:23:12.340
warmth of the sun.

1361
01:23:15.750 --> 01:23:16.583
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1362
01:23:17.080 --> 01:23:21.420
<v 0>Now that shoulder wound that he kind of blew off actually isn't,</v>

1363
01:23:21.530 --> 01:23:24.600
is not all that good.
He starts getting a little,
uh,

1364
01:23:25.240 --> 01:23:29.020
starts getting a little infection in.
It passes out from it.
I woke up this time,

1365
01:23:29.021 --> 01:23:31.210
they carried me back to the battalions aid station.

1366
01:23:31.540 --> 01:23:36.010
The medic set the stretcher on a dirt floor.
Doctor comes in,
you're lucky.

1367
01:23:36.730 --> 01:23:39.040
Had you waited any longer,
the infection would have spread.

1368
01:23:40.220 --> 01:23:40.920
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1369
01:23:40.920 --> 01:23:43.470
<v 0>Some time goes by.
The next day I felt fine.</v>

1370
01:23:43.680 --> 01:23:48.270
The doctors had me on a Jello Diet.
So when the doctor came on,

1371
01:23:48.360 --> 01:23:52.500
came on his rounds,
I told him I wanted to leave.
I need to go back to my unit.

1372
01:23:53.160 --> 01:23:57.960
I said,
typical fashion,
the uh,

1373
01:23:58.050 --> 01:24:02.190
of the,
uh,
American doughboy,
the American grunt,

1374
01:24:02.880 --> 01:24:05.310
they get wounded.
What do they want to do?
They want to go back.

1375
01:24:05.460 --> 01:24:09.720
They want to go back with their team and that's exactly what he,
what he does.

1376
01:24:11.400 --> 01:24:15.780
And a couple of days later,
he gets back with his unit and of course,

1377
01:24:15.781 --> 01:24:16.410
what are they doing?

1378
01:24:16.410 --> 01:24:20.430
They're going on attack and as they're going on attack back to the book,

1379
01:24:20.431 --> 01:24:24.270
all of a sudden there was a thunderous roar as an artillery barrage hit us.

1380
01:24:24.390 --> 01:24:28.050
I was blown straight up in the air.
My feet were over my head.

1381
01:24:28.500 --> 01:24:32.130
I came down on my shoulder and my head,
the mud soften the blow,

1382
01:24:33.060 --> 01:24:36.870
grabbing my helmet.
I yelled for my section to run forward out of the kill zone.

1383
01:24:37.650 --> 01:24:40.170
Three guys in front of me and two behind me were wounded.

1384
01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:48.270
I could hear them moaning as they clutch their stomachs and legs.

1385
01:24:49.680 --> 01:24:52.290
I checked myself.
I had escaped without a scratch.

1386
01:24:53.430 --> 01:24:57.330
Medics hurried to the down men.
I,
I looked back and Saki,

1387
01:24:57.331 --> 01:24:59.880
ugly standing days to get moving.
I yelled,

1388
01:25:01.710 --> 01:25:05.070
he looked at me with a funny expression on his face and then look down at his

1389
01:25:05.071 --> 01:25:07.710
waist.
He had been hit by shrapnel in the stomach.

1390
01:25:08.700 --> 01:25:12.240
I could see the blood soaking through his fatigues.
Um,
hit rich,

1391
01:25:13.350 --> 01:25:16.680
get down.
I said,
and I hollered medic.

1392
01:25:17.770 --> 01:25:21.060
He actually fell to his knees and rolled over onto his back.

1393
01:25:22.080 --> 01:25:24.840
I was torn.
I wanted to run to him,

1394
01:25:25.020 --> 01:25:27.120
but I had to keep the rest of the section moving.

1395
01:25:28.460 --> 01:25:31.150
It was one of those choices that you never want to make.

1396
01:25:32.210 --> 01:25:32.820
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

1397
01:25:32.820 --> 01:25:36.120
<v 0>I saw the medics coming and turn to join the other men.</v>

1398
01:25:37.840 --> 01:25:40.660
Good luck buddy.
See you later.
I screamed over my shoulder.

1399
01:25:41.920 --> 01:25:46.480
I couldn't look back,
but I knew I'd probably never see.

1400
01:25:46.481 --> 01:25:51.160
He Lee again.
A stomach wound.
I thought,
Jesus Christ,

1401
01:25:51.161 --> 01:25:54.820
I hope he makes it.
I wanted to sit down and cry,

1402
01:25:55.390 --> 01:25:57.340
but this was not the time or place for that.

1403
01:25:58.720 --> 01:26:00.970
I had damn near lost a whole squad.

1404
01:26:11.570 --> 01:26:14.660
There was only one way to go at the hill,
so now they're trying to take the hill.

1405
01:26:14.900 --> 01:26:17.360
There's only one way to go with the hill and it was straight forward.

1406
01:26:18.110 --> 01:26:22.670
I looked across the open space we were going to cross.
There was little cover.

1407
01:26:23.720 --> 01:26:24.950
This was going to be tough.

1408
01:26:25.160 --> 01:26:28.760
There was no time to dwell on Hiigli or are dwindling numbers.

1409
01:26:28.850 --> 01:26:31.310
The longer we sat behind the railroad embankment,

1410
01:26:31.820 --> 01:26:33.620
but tougher it would be to get started.

1411
01:26:34.590 --> 01:26:39.200
Bronzer was waiting to get artillery support.
The same guys I had dinner with.

1412
01:26:39.350 --> 01:26:43.190
I hope they remembered what I'd told them and come through leaning back against

1413
01:26:43.191 --> 01:26:46.460
the embankment.
I saw Alan and the Korean hosteling across the field,

1414
01:26:46.700 --> 01:26:51.350
each carrying Tupac boards with Ammo.
Get ready,
Brahms,
or said,

1415
01:26:51.980 --> 01:26:56.840
I grew up my rifle and closed my eyes.
My mind knew going forward was crazy,

1416
01:26:56.960 --> 01:26:59.930
but I willed my legs to move soon.

1417
01:26:59.931 --> 01:27:02.720
I was running and leading the rest of this section across the patties.

1418
01:27:03.110 --> 01:27:06.710
Mortar and artillery.
Fire crashed around me,
but I didn't notice.

1419
01:27:06.890 --> 01:27:10.070
I only saw the flashes of the North Korean machine guns ahead of me.

1420
01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:12.290
I stayed close to Mac.

1421
01:27:12.530 --> 01:27:17.530
I could hear him hollering at his squad to move to my right.

1422
01:27:17.660 --> 01:27:21.440
I saw that Walsh was right beside us.
He had his squad movie.

1423
01:27:23.080 --> 01:27:28.000
It all seemed almost normal.
It was just another day,
another attack.

1424
01:27:29.970 --> 01:27:33.510
So you're getting mortar and artillery fire crashing all around you,

1425
01:27:33.511 --> 01:27:35.880
but you're not paying attention to that because you're really paying attention

1426
01:27:35.881 --> 01:27:39.720
to the damn muzzle flashes from the Korean machine guns that are right in front

1427
01:27:39.721 --> 01:27:44.220
of you.
When they,
they,

1428
01:27:44.240 --> 01:27:47.700
they end up pulling off that attack and again get the books so you can get some

1429
01:27:47.701 --> 01:27:51.180
of those details.
When he attacks complete,
he writes,

1430
01:27:51.181 --> 01:27:52.560
I was not a religious person,

1431
01:27:52.561 --> 01:27:57.561
but I felt like one that day I gave thanks with Walsh for our gift of life

1432
01:27:59.740 --> 01:28:04.680
after services that evening we turned in our basic load of ammunition.

1433
01:28:05.730 --> 01:28:07.830
Another sure sign that it was over.

1434
01:28:09.600 --> 01:28:12.390
So just to rehash that last little statement,

1435
01:28:12.630 --> 01:28:15.330
they're turning in their ammunition because they're getting a positive feeling

1436
01:28:15.331 --> 01:28:16.380
like they've been doing this good fighting.

1437
01:28:16.381 --> 01:28:19.230
They'd been on a pursuit and they were kind of on the defensive in the beginning

1438
01:28:19.231 --> 01:28:21.960
and now they go back on the counter attack and now they're feeling pretty good

1439
01:28:21.961 --> 01:28:25.170
and now they,
they get,
Hey,
you know what?
You can turn in your ammunition.

1440
01:28:26.160 --> 01:28:26.993
Think about that.

1441
01:28:29.580 --> 01:28:34.290
But back to the book of that night,
we got orders to move,
but not home.

1442
01:28:34.770 --> 01:28:37.110
We were headed north to the town of Busan.

1443
01:28:39.210 --> 01:28:41.790
I was a corporal when we arrived in Korea.

1444
01:28:41.910 --> 01:28:46.770
Now less than 67 days later,
I was going to be a master sergeant.

1445
01:28:46.800 --> 01:28:50.070
The army's a highest noncommissioned officers ranked.

1446
01:28:50.110 --> 01:28:50.943
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1447
01:28:52.570 --> 01:28:57.130
<v 0>The promotions couldn't have come at a better time with the war winding down.</v>

1448
01:28:57.131 --> 01:29:01.980
I was sure this will be the last of the fast promotions.
So he's actually,

1449
01:29:01.981 --> 01:29:05.310
again,
these guys think that they're doing a good job and they kind of think that

1450
01:29:05.311 --> 01:29:09.870
things are heading in their direction.
And yeah,
1950 I mean,

1451
01:29:09.871 --> 01:29:13.290
we know just from history that this war is not even close to over yet,

1452
01:29:13.830 --> 01:29:17.460
and yeah,
but that's the way they're feeling.

1453
01:29:18.150 --> 01:29:20.870
And can you imagine,
I mean,
he's,
he's at the highest,
he's,
he's a,

1454
01:29:20.910 --> 01:29:25.470
he's a master sergeant right now.
67 days.
He got promoted through all the ranks.

1455
01:29:25.740 --> 01:29:28.380
That's how many guys,
that's how many guys were wounded or killed,

1456
01:29:29.160 --> 01:29:33.780
that they needed him to be promoted to run these units.

1457
01:29:35.820 --> 01:29:40.820
So they now get sent into a position where they're holding a bridge and while

1458
01:29:42.361 --> 01:29:43.230
they're holding this bridge,

1459
01:29:43.260 --> 01:29:48.260
he sends a couple of guys out on recon to take a look around and they'd come

1460
01:29:48.571 --> 01:29:51.480
back and he says,
what the Hell is that?
I asked him,

1461
01:29:51.630 --> 01:29:53.730
it's just an old glove and a shovel.
It's all wet.

1462
01:29:53.731 --> 01:29:55.050
It's probably been there for weeks.

1463
01:29:55.290 --> 01:29:58.260
He said in a defiant tone and that's one of the guys that were on the recon

1464
01:29:58.261 --> 01:29:59.820
talking.
That was on the recon talking.

1465
01:30:00.720 --> 01:30:04.320
It didn't look like any glove I had seen before.
It was large and padded.

1466
01:30:05.430 --> 01:30:08.370
What else did you find?
I shot back just some old positions.

1467
01:30:08.371 --> 01:30:09.360
Nothing to worry about.

1468
01:30:10.620 --> 01:30:14.160
I was a little concerned now and continued to quiz him on how many holes there

1469
01:30:14.161 --> 01:30:16.620
were up there around five or six.

1470
01:30:16.920 --> 01:30:21.480
The sergeant said was the dirt wet or dry?
God Damn it.

1471
01:30:21.481 --> 01:30:23.670
I don't know.
It was pitch black.
I'm telling you,

1472
01:30:23.671 --> 01:30:27.270
there's nothing up on that fucking hill.
The smug sergeant snapped at me.

1473
01:30:29.160 --> 01:30:32.490
You can guess what's coming.
You find a shovel up their guess what's going on?

1474
01:30:32.550 --> 01:30:34.380
They're digging in.
That's what's going on.

1475
01:30:34.500 --> 01:30:39.150
They're digging in and these gloves,
these kinds of heavy gloves,

1476
01:30:39.300 --> 01:30:40.420
um,
you know,

1477
01:30:40.440 --> 01:30:43.770
probably resupply from the Chinese cause that's why I didn't recognize him.

1478
01:30:44.640 --> 01:30:48.330
So they hadn't really encountered the Chinese yet that we're about to attack in

1479
01:30:48.720 --> 01:30:49.980
massive numbers.

1480
01:30:52.920 --> 01:30:57.270
Back to the book around 4:00 AM the hail erupted,

1481
01:30:58.200 --> 01:31:02.460
four machine guns from the high hills on the south end of the bridge opened up

1482
01:31:02.640 --> 01:31:06.000
two guns cross firing on each end of the bridge.

1483
01:31:06.120 --> 01:31:07.470
The tracers from the machine gun,

1484
01:31:07.471 --> 01:31:11.100
we're skipping off the concrete like firecrackers.
My guys quickly,
man,

1485
01:31:11.101 --> 01:31:14.310
the 57 record this rifle and got off a few rounds.

1486
01:31:15.120 --> 01:31:19.260
It did little immediately we started getting hit with mortar fire.

1487
01:31:19.410 --> 01:31:22.320
My radio was shot up and I tried to get the company on the land line,

1488
01:31:22.321 --> 01:31:25.440
but it was out to my mind was on my men.

1489
01:31:25.650 --> 01:31:30.270
I'd lost two in the opening barrage and I had lost track of the two men on the

1490
01:31:30.271 --> 01:31:31.500
south side of the bridge.

1491
01:31:31.800 --> 01:31:36.360
This attack didn't make sense too much fire power for a few stragglers.
So He's,

1492
01:31:36.450 --> 01:31:38.730
again looking back to the recon report that he got,

1493
01:31:40.260 --> 01:31:43.800
it looked like the 4th of July fireworks as tracers skipped off the concrete.

1494
01:31:43.800 --> 01:31:47.070
But I soon realized that some of the fire was coming from our left flank.

1495
01:31:47.190 --> 01:31:50.190
Jesus Christ.
It was our own company firing at us.

1496
01:31:51.090 --> 01:31:53.490
So we got a little blue on blue going down.

1497
01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:56.520
Which again for folks that are in the military,

1498
01:31:57.570 --> 01:31:59.130
blue on blue is a real thing.

1499
01:32:00.160 --> 01:32:03.190
And if you don't pay attention to and you don't plan for it can absolutely

1500
01:32:03.191 --> 01:32:05.260
happen to,
you know Lafe was saying that the other day.

1501
01:32:05.620 --> 01:32:08.260
If you would have asked him before we went on deployment,

1502
01:32:08.470 --> 01:32:13.470
what are the chances that you're involved in a blue on blue situation?

1503
01:32:13.720 --> 01:32:16.020
Before we went on deployment,
life would've been like no chance.

1504
01:32:16.021 --> 01:32:19.420
I would never happen to us.
And then during deployment,
you know there was,

1505
01:32:19.510 --> 01:32:23.650
there was the,
I think we talked about three blue on blue possibilities.

1506
01:32:23.651 --> 01:32:28.390
Well one real and in two possibilities in the extreme ownership.

1507
01:32:29.170 --> 01:32:31.990
And you know,
one is the opening story of blue on blue.

1508
01:32:32.200 --> 01:32:37.200
One is Lafe with Chris Kyle who's getting ready to take a shot and you know,

1509
01:32:37.931 --> 01:32:40.720
life is basically getting asked,
hey,
take that guy out.

1510
01:32:40.721 --> 01:32:44.920
And Lafe puts the brakes on it and it turns out being friendly.
US Army soldiers.

1511
01:32:45.250 --> 01:32:49.120
And then one where I got guys on the rooftop of a building and there's a a

1512
01:32:49.180 --> 01:32:52.570
Bradley fighting vehicle that's wanting to engage it with 25 millimeter chain

1513
01:32:52.571 --> 01:32:55.120
gun.
And they're looking,

1514
01:32:55.180 --> 01:32:58.980
they're reporting that they're looking at one building but they're actually look

1515
01:32:59.050 --> 01:33:03.510
and I'm and all indications are yes you can engage.
Those are enemies.

1516
01:33:03.511 --> 01:33:08.230
Snipers on that rooftop take 'em out.
But on the same block,

1517
01:33:08.350 --> 01:33:10.890
a few buildings down.
And it was actually considered,

1518
01:33:10.910 --> 01:33:15.910
was actually like probably a couple blocks away was my guys and that gunner in

1519
01:33:17.891 --> 01:33:21.820
that Bradley that was reporting it and he just got a little bit a little bit off

1520
01:33:21.880 --> 01:33:24.070
on which building was which building.
Oh yeah.

1521
01:33:24.310 --> 01:33:29.170
So he was actually pointing at one building and just thought he was.
So he,

1522
01:33:29.171 --> 01:33:32.890
he's looking through,
they've really good imagery on those buildings,

1523
01:33:32.891 --> 01:33:33.970
especially the thermo,

1524
01:33:33.971 --> 01:33:38.620
so you can see like white hot and he's looking at a building down this long

1525
01:33:38.621 --> 01:33:41.320
street and he's reporting,
I don't,
I forget what the buildings were,

1526
01:33:41.321 --> 01:33:42.280
but the building,

1527
01:33:42.281 --> 01:33:45.940
he's in your reporting building 50 I've got an enemy enemy personnel on the

1528
01:33:45.941 --> 01:33:50.890
rooftop and my guys were in building a hundred.
Yeah.
So he's asking,

1529
01:33:50.891 --> 01:33:54.520
does anyone have any true,
any friendly troops in building 50 no.

1530
01:33:54.521 --> 01:33:57.970
No one has any troops in building 50 oh,
there's a,
there's an enemy with,

1531
01:33:58.120 --> 01:34:01.690
with a sculpt weapons there.
And everyone's thinking,
Hey,

1532
01:34:01.720 --> 01:34:04.990
this is the sniper that's been killing our guys by the way.
Right.

1533
01:34:06.220 --> 01:34:09.280
Let's take 'em out.
And then looking at,

1534
01:34:09.850 --> 01:34:13.460
and what I actually told them to do,
I was like,
hey,
before,
and,

1535
01:34:13.510 --> 01:34:16.750
and the reason I was heads up was because we had blue on blue.

1536
01:34:17.410 --> 01:34:20.470
I knew that this was a possibility.
So I said,

1537
01:34:20.500 --> 01:34:25.090
count the buildings from your intersection up to the target building.

1538
01:34:26.260 --> 01:34:30.130
And so then it just went quiet for a little while and he comes back,
he's like,

1539
01:34:30.170 --> 01:34:33.730
standby,
because he caught himself,
you know,
gives,
you can see on the battle map,

1540
01:34:33.731 --> 01:34:36.730
it's like,
okay,
one,
two,
three,
four,
five,
six,

1541
01:34:36.760 --> 01:34:40.140
seven and that's what he,

1542
01:34:40.180 --> 01:34:42.910
whenever he gets to 12 and he's like,
oh wait,
I'm in the wrong spot.

1543
01:34:42.940 --> 01:34:46.660
And you realized it.
It's,
it's like,
uh,
you know,
so it's still down.
But yeah,

1544
01:34:46.661 --> 01:34:50.170
you don't want to be on a rooftop getting hit with 50 or 25 millimeter chain gum

1545
01:34:50.171 --> 01:34:53.480
from a Bradley fighting vehicle is not going to be a good situation.
No,
sir.

1546
01:34:53.890 --> 01:34:56.530
At all.
And so the same thing's going on here.

1547
01:34:56.560 --> 01:34:58.240
You got firefight going on at night,

1548
01:34:58.241 --> 01:35:01.280
you got troops moving around and these guys are getting lit up by their own men,

1549
01:35:03.200 --> 01:35:05.870
all kinds of ways tactically to deconflict these things.

1550
01:35:05.871 --> 01:35:07.190
But you have to pay attention to you.

1551
01:35:07.280 --> 01:35:11.870
And one of the things you have to do is you have to have the humility to

1552
01:35:11.871 --> 01:35:14.640
recognize that it can actually happen.
Yeah.

1553
01:35:16.260 --> 01:35:17.093
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1554
01:35:17.280 --> 01:35:19.680
<v 0>Back to the book,
the Koreans were all over the place.</v>

1555
01:35:19.890 --> 01:35:23.220
Mack was hit worse than he thought.
I could feel his back.

1556
01:35:23.221 --> 01:35:25.260
It was drenched in blood.
He started to choke.

1557
01:35:25.261 --> 01:35:26.820
I talked to him but he didn't answer.

1558
01:35:27.990 --> 01:35:31.650
I laid him down and at the same time hollered to the rest of the men to pull in

1559
01:35:31.651 --> 01:35:32.910
tighter around the road.

1560
01:35:34.140 --> 01:35:38.940
I had four men left are two jeeps were shot up,
one was on fire.

1561
01:35:40.170 --> 01:35:43.860
I knew at this point we could not hold the bridge,
get the breach,

1562
01:35:44.190 --> 01:35:48.000
get the breach block from the 57 and throw it in the river.
A yelled to my guys.

1563
01:35:49.940 --> 01:35:51.720
So,
so that's sort of like,

1564
01:35:53.100 --> 01:35:56.340
that's like one of those when you make that call right there,

1565
01:35:56.880 --> 01:36:01.500
which is disable our weapon permanently cause we're going to not make it.

1566
01:36:02.610 --> 01:36:06.630
We don't want the enemy to be able to use this when may capture it in a matter

1567
01:36:06.631 --> 01:36:09.840
of minutes.
That's what he's saying is,
you know,

1568
01:36:10.230 --> 01:36:12.600
get the breach block out and throw it in the river.

1569
01:36:13.950 --> 01:36:14.610
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

1570
01:36:14.610 --> 01:36:19.610
<v 0>And then of course the North Koreans attack again and got within 20 feet before</v>

1571
01:36:19.651 --> 01:36:20.484
we stopped them.

1572
01:36:21.030 --> 01:36:24.180
I rushed to the other side of the road and got slammed to the ground from an

1573
01:36:24.181 --> 01:36:28.620
explosion confused.
I stumbled into a nearby ditch.
My head was ringing.

1574
01:36:28.770 --> 01:36:29.610
I checked Mac.

1575
01:36:29.611 --> 01:36:34.500
He was dead and so were the other two men on his side of the road with only two

1576
01:36:34.501 --> 01:36:36.750
men left.
We had to leave the bridge.

1577
01:36:37.050 --> 01:36:40.860
I shoved a grenade in the breach of the 57 the grenade exploded,

1578
01:36:40.861 --> 01:36:45.861
destroying the gun and we started pushing up the ditch away from the bridge.

1579
01:36:46.770 --> 01:36:48.840
I couldn't see or hear anything.

1580
01:36:51.810 --> 01:36:52.643
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1581
01:36:52.970 --> 01:36:56.360
<v 0>We had not gone very far when the point man told me someone was coming down the</v>

1582
01:36:56.361 --> 01:36:59.240
ditch toward us,
I took a knee and re readied my rifle.

1583
01:36:59.900 --> 01:37:04.220
Hold your fire until they get closer.
I whispered
the point,

1584
01:37:04.221 --> 01:37:07.250
man yelled quickly back.
Sarge,

1585
01:37:07.251 --> 01:37:12.080
their own guys to two of them from battalion.
Come over here.

1586
01:37:12.110 --> 01:37:13.520
What's going on?
I barked at them.

1587
01:37:14.870 --> 01:37:17.120
The men looked at crazed both.

1588
01:37:17.121 --> 01:37:21.140
We're talking a mile a minute and I tried to settle them down.
Look,
take it easy.

1589
01:37:21.141 --> 01:37:23.300
I told them slowly.
Tell me what you know.

1590
01:37:24.830 --> 01:37:28.580
The battalion got hit.
They were in the headquarters before we knew it.

1591
01:37:28.670 --> 01:37:30.260
The whole damn place was a mess.

1592
01:37:30.320 --> 01:37:34.130
One of the soldiers said there were dead and wounded all over.

1593
01:37:34.310 --> 01:37:38.270
Everything was shot up.
It looked like an artillery barrage made a direct hit.

1594
01:37:38.420 --> 01:37:39.830
It was total chaos.

1595
01:37:40.700 --> 01:37:41.330
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1596
01:37:41.330 --> 01:37:43.310
<v 0>What are you to trying to do?
I asked.</v>

1597
01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:48.560
They said they were trying to make contact with someone.
Sarge,

1598
01:37:48.561 --> 01:37:53.480
I'm Taylor,
one of Walsh's men,
the other guys from first battalion in the dark.

1599
01:37:53.481 --> 01:37:55.530
I didn't recognize him.
Where's Walsh?

1600
01:37:57.950 --> 01:38:00.590
They're all dead.
Sarge Taylor said,

1601
01:38:03.080 --> 01:38:03.913
<v 1>okay,</v>

1602
01:38:09.990 --> 01:38:14.990
<v 0>so they make movement towards that battalion headquarters area and there's still</v>

1603
01:38:17.790 --> 01:38:21.610
some friendlies there.
We stumbled into the battalion headquarters area at,

1604
01:38:21.620 --> 01:38:25.950
and I introduced myself and asked Jones what the situation was.
It was not good.

1605
01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:32.000
There were 30 or 40 wounded or dead doc Anderson and the chaplain and are in the

1606
01:38:32.461 --> 01:38:34.560
command post trying to take care of the wounded.

1607
01:38:35.580 --> 01:38:37.590
Jones thought the battalion commander was dead.

1608
01:38:37.830 --> 01:38:40.980
They just walked in on them and shot up the whole damn place.

1609
01:38:48.370 --> 01:38:53.370
So at this point they kind of Ziggy out of there into a tree line and we got

1610
01:38:53.921 --> 01:38:57.760
into the woodline and through ourselves to the ground completely exhausted.

1611
01:39:00.370 --> 01:39:05.370
And from there the chaplain moved onto another position,

1612
01:39:06.281 --> 01:39:09.160
but before he left,
he told me we were fighting the Chinese.

1613
01:39:10.720 --> 01:39:14.350
We'd heard rumors about the Chinese soldiers coming over the border.

1614
01:39:15.070 --> 01:39:18.160
That pretty much confirmed what I had fought for the last couple of hours.

1615
01:39:18.250 --> 01:39:21.460
Jones had basically told me when he mentioned that they're quilted,

1616
01:39:21.461 --> 01:39:24.580
uniform jackets looked much different than the North Koreans.

1617
01:39:25.660 --> 01:39:30.190
First Lieutenant Phil Peterson and Walt Mayo had also scrambled into our

1618
01:39:30.191 --> 01:39:33.340
perimeter.
Both officers were artillery forward observers,

1619
01:39:33.341 --> 01:39:35.350
but had lost their radios in the confusion.

1620
01:39:36.130 --> 01:39:40.480
They'd gotten reports hours before the attack that the Chinese were in the area.

1621
01:39:40.690 --> 01:39:41.690
The Chinese soldiers,

1622
01:39:42.040 --> 01:39:46.690
soldiers had crossed the Yay Lou to protect electrical generators along the

1623
01:39:46.691 --> 01:39:48.460
river that night.

1624
01:39:48.640 --> 01:39:51.760
Peterson had seen a Chinese prisoner in his quilted jacket,

1625
01:39:52.090 --> 01:39:54.850
but had no idea the danger we were in.

1626
01:39:55.750 --> 01:39:59.800
They'd been ordered back to the battalion and then tried to escape when

1627
01:39:59.801 --> 01:40:02.740
artillery unit tried to save their own Howard sirs.

1628
01:40:03.790 --> 01:40:06.610
But the Chinese had already cut the road.

1629
01:40:08.200 --> 01:40:09.280
We were trapped.

1630
01:40:10.570 --> 01:40:11.190
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

1631
01:40:11.190 --> 01:40:13.830
<v 0>For the rest of the day we set up our defenses.</v>

1632
01:40:14.670 --> 01:40:19.260
We knew the Chinese would come for us that night.
So that's it.

1633
01:40:19.440 --> 01:40:22.710
Right now they're,
they're surrounded and

1634
01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:24.690
<v 1>yeah,</v>

1635
01:40:24.690 --> 01:40:29.690
<v 0>they set up a perimeter to the best of their ability and they got a bunch of</v>

1636
01:40:29.971 --> 01:40:33.780
wounded.
They're low on ammunition.
They're low on food or low on water.

1637
01:40:34.800 --> 01:40:38.430
And so a perimeter is basically,
for those of you that don't know,

1638
01:40:38.431 --> 01:40:41.640
you set up 360 degree security perimeter.
You dig some Fox holes,

1639
01:40:41.641 --> 01:40:45.120
you put machine guns pointing out,
it's your,
it's your last stand situation.

1640
01:40:45.121 --> 01:40:47.910
Now it doesn't always last stand because when you're on a normal patrol,

1641
01:40:47.911 --> 01:40:51.390
you set up a perimeter.
Anytime you stop,
you set up 360 degree security.

1642
01:40:51.500 --> 01:40:52.333
<v 1>Hmm.</v>

1643
01:40:53.590 --> 01:40:54.100
<v 0>And in this</v>

1644
01:40:54.100 --> 01:40:55.330
<v 2>situation,
that's what they're doing.</v>

1645
01:40:55.331 --> 01:40:58.090
They're set up their perimeter to the best of their ability with what they've

1646
01:40:58.091 --> 01:40:58.870
got left.

1647
01:40:58.870 --> 01:41:03.490
And then there's a little command post in the center of the perimeter and here

1648
01:41:03.491 --> 01:41:05.890
we go back to the book,
inside the command post,

1649
01:41:05.891 --> 01:41:10.810
I knew what the officers were talking about.
It was a forbidden subject.

1650
01:41:11.860 --> 01:41:12.610
What were we,

1651
01:41:12.610 --> 01:41:17.610
what were we going to do with the wounded in the terrible final mo moment that

1652
01:41:19.061 --> 01:41:22.960
everyone knew was coming,
the battalion surgeon,

1653
01:41:23.170 --> 01:41:27.100
doc Anderson and the chaplain were doing what they could for about 40 wounded

1654
01:41:27.101 --> 01:41:30.430
men,
but we couldn't hold out for long without a relief column,

1655
01:41:31.330 --> 01:41:36.100
meaning people coming to back them up.
And if we had to run the wounded officers,

1656
01:41:36.101 --> 01:41:40.510
we're going to have to decide whether or not to leave themselves and the other

1657
01:41:40.511 --> 01:41:43.810
wounded men behind to the mercies of the enemy.

1658
01:41:47.580 --> 01:41:52.500
<v 0>And once he kind of hears that inside the center of the perimeter,
during the,</v>

1659
01:41:52.580 --> 01:41:52.850
at the,

1660
01:41:52.850 --> 01:41:57.840
at the command post there he goes back out to his edge of the perimeter.

1661
01:41:59.250 --> 01:42:00.480
And then here we go,
back to the book,

1662
01:42:00.481 --> 01:42:02.970
I saw a group of 20 men running right at us.

1663
01:42:04.290 --> 01:42:08.100
They were Americans and were hollering and waving at us.
I prayed there.

1664
01:42:08.160 --> 01:42:12.600
They were the lead element of a relief column because of course they're hearing

1665
01:42:12.601 --> 01:42:15.630
rumors that someone's going to come,
there's pee,
there's friendlies on the way.

1666
01:42:15.631 --> 01:42:17.670
That's what they're getting.
They're kind of,
and it,

1667
01:42:17.800 --> 01:42:22.620
I wasn't clear where they were getting those rumors from or whether they were

1668
01:42:22.621 --> 01:42:27.060
just assuming like,
hey,
we're here.
Americans are going to come to get us.

1669
01:42:27.210 --> 01:42:29.820
They've got to be sending in a relief battalion.
We just need to hang on.

1670
01:42:30.600 --> 01:42:31.530
So that's what he's saying.

1671
01:42:31.531 --> 01:42:34.320
I prayed that they were the lead element of a relief column.

1672
01:42:35.370 --> 01:42:39.060
The other guys were cheering them on as they made the short dash two our trench.

1673
01:42:39.570 --> 01:42:42.690
They slid inside their chest,
chest heaving.

1674
01:42:43.980 --> 01:42:45.510
What unit are you guys from?

1675
01:42:45.511 --> 01:42:50.511
I asked second of the eighth an officer said between deep breaths,

1676
01:42:53.340 --> 01:42:57.600
the stragglers pushed by us and collapsed in the center of the perimeter.

1677
01:42:57.960 --> 01:43:00.720
Everyone's morale sank lower than whale shit.

1678
01:43:01.860 --> 01:43:06.330
The energy and excitement seem to deflate from the men in the trench and all at

1679
01:43:06.331 --> 01:43:09.150
once.
Their heads Hoang and shoulders dipped.

1680
01:43:10.440 --> 01:43:12.480
These guys weren't a relief column.

1681
01:43:13.140 --> 01:43:16.170
They were just more stragglers from the second battalion.

1682
01:43:17.740 --> 01:43:18.970
I couldn't shake the thought

1683
01:43:20.990 --> 01:43:23.030
that no one was coming for us.

1684
01:43:33.700 --> 01:43:38.320
There's a soldier that he talks about,
a Polish guy,
I mean American guy,

1685
01:43:38.321 --> 01:43:43.120
but of Polish descent,
last names,
a Wallach.
Later that day,

1686
01:43:43.310 --> 01:43:46.150
I,
so now they're in their perimeter.
Later that day,
Wallach sent for me.

1687
01:43:46.510 --> 01:43:49.540
I walked across the west side of the perimeter and som standing near a machine

1688
01:43:49.541 --> 01:43:50.374
gun position.

1689
01:43:50.380 --> 01:43:54.920
He looked and started pointing out towards what looked like an open field.

1690
01:43:56.090 --> 01:44:00.410
Look over there.
He said,
I watched where he was pointing.
I didn't see anything.

1691
01:44:01.400 --> 01:44:05.120
I looked at him and shrugged my soldiers.
No,
keep looking.
He said,

1692
01:44:05.121 --> 01:44:06.590
this time staring intently.

1693
01:44:07.720 --> 01:44:08.250
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1694
01:44:08.250 --> 01:44:09.450
<v 0>Then I saw it,</v>

1695
01:44:10.170 --> 01:44:13.290
a faint shovel full of dirt flying right into the air.

1696
01:44:14.490 --> 01:44:16.590
The little bastards were digging a trench.

1697
01:44:16.800 --> 01:44:20.790
There were about a half does nor so digging a path right for us.

1698
01:44:21.120 --> 01:44:23.430
Our machine guns had been keeping them at a distance,

1699
01:44:23.640 --> 01:44:25.020
but when their trench was done,

1700
01:44:25.350 --> 01:44:29.430
they could move undercover right up to the edge of our trenches.

1701
01:44:31.190 --> 01:44:32.640
So that's a determined enemy.

1702
01:44:33.240 --> 01:44:38.240
They're just going to spend all day digging toward you as clandestine as they

1703
01:44:39.781 --> 01:44:42.780
can,
but they can only keep it so clandestine and no one the only,

1704
01:44:42.790 --> 01:44:44.130
only one soldier noticed

1705
01:44:48.900 --> 01:44:53.220
back to the book.
Sunset was a bad time.
Night always meant another attack.

1706
01:44:53.221 --> 01:44:56.370
It started with a probe.
A few Chinese soldiers would move up to the perimeter,

1707
01:44:56.371 --> 01:45:00.060
followed by a short and violent firefight.
Shortly after the probe,

1708
01:45:00.061 --> 01:45:05.061
the artillery and mortar fire would start followed by the demonic ball of brass

1709
01:45:06.031 --> 01:45:09.270
bugles and whistles.
As the Chinese infantry attacked

1710
01:45:12.770 --> 01:45:13.940
the,
now he's talking about his guys.

1711
01:45:13.941 --> 01:45:16.160
The men looked at me with weary and tired eyes.

1712
01:45:16.161 --> 01:45:20.150
All of us had scruffy beards and our skin was caked with mud and blood.

1713
01:45:20.390 --> 01:45:21.950
None of the soldiers could look at me,

1714
01:45:23.020 --> 01:45:23.480
<v 1>okay?</v>

1715
01:45:23.480 --> 01:45:26.390
<v 0>They knew that they wouldn't survive unless they got up and fought,</v>

1716
01:45:26.750 --> 01:45:28.010
but they just sat there,

1717
01:45:28.920 --> 01:45:29.600
<v 1>okay?</v>

1718
01:45:29.600 --> 01:45:32.990
<v 0>They were not cowards,
just frozen by fear.
For some,</v>

1719
01:45:33.110 --> 01:45:34.820
this was their first taste of combat.

1720
01:45:34.940 --> 01:45:37.340
Boys who overnight we're forced to become men.

1721
01:45:37.580 --> 01:45:40.370
I could only imagine the terror they must have been through.

1722
01:45:41.360 --> 01:45:45.350
Must have been going through.
You've got two choices.
I yelled,

1723
01:45:45.830 --> 01:45:46.140
<v 1>okay,</v>

1724
01:45:46.140 --> 01:45:49.530
<v 0>get up and get to the line or I'll shoot you.</v>

1725
01:45:51.170 --> 01:45:51.800
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1726
01:45:51.800 --> 01:45:55.640
<v 0>That shocked them into action.
I don't think they fought.
I would shoot them.</v>

1727
01:45:55.850 --> 01:46:00.440
I had no sooner finished prodding the men out of their interior holes than one

1728
01:46:00.441 --> 01:46:03.110
hell of a fight took place at the battalion command post.

1729
01:46:04.220 --> 01:46:07.280
I knew there were mostly wounded soldiers there and I feared for Jones,

1730
01:46:07.281 --> 01:46:11.030
the lone man on the machine gun,
but I had my own problems.

1731
01:46:11.180 --> 01:46:14.510
The bugles and whistles broke the silence and the Chinese rush.

1732
01:46:14.511 --> 01:46:18.590
The east side of our perimeter,
they came in waves straight into our fire.

1733
01:46:19.700 --> 01:46:21.860
As quickly as they fell more appeared,

1734
01:46:22.840 --> 01:46:25.390
they moved into our fire like they were possessed.

1735
01:46:25.720 --> 01:46:29.440
I raced from trench to trench moving men where the Chinese concentrated their

1736
01:46:29.441 --> 01:46:32.110
attack.
When their attack on the east side slowed,

1737
01:46:32.290 --> 01:46:36.160
they launched an attack on the west side.
Although we were dug in,

1738
01:46:36.161 --> 01:46:39.490
our casualties were mounting.
I kept moving men to wear the most.

1739
01:46:39.491 --> 01:46:42.010
Chinese were concentrated,
the attack slowed down,

1740
01:46:42.011 --> 01:46:45.070
but it was not long before they began an assault on the west side of the

1741
01:46:45.071 --> 01:46:45.904
perimeter.

1742
01:46:46.400 --> 01:46:46.630
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1743
01:46:46.630 --> 01:46:49.230
<v 0>Now they get this idea as these attacks are taking place,</v>

1744
01:46:49.231 --> 01:46:51.090
there's these trucks that were there,

1745
01:46:51.870 --> 01:46:54.630
kind of abandoned trucks and they figure it's nighttime.

1746
01:46:54.631 --> 01:46:56.430
If they can set these trucks on fire,

1747
01:46:56.670 --> 01:47:01.670
then it will allow them to see the enemy and so that's what they do.

1748
01:47:02.370 --> 01:47:05.300
They want,
once one of these attack starts,
they,

1749
01:47:05.490 --> 01:47:10.490
they shot the gas tanks and then shot tracers until all the vehicles were on

1750
01:47:11.611 --> 01:47:16.180
fire.
When the Chinese name for tree men ran past,

1751
01:47:16.181 --> 01:47:19.270
we could see them silhouetted against the light.
It was a shooting gallery.

1752
01:47:19.420 --> 01:47:23.230
We cut down the first wave only to watch the next one's climb over their

1753
01:47:23.231 --> 01:47:27.130
comrades and keep coming.
We mowed down the next wave,

1754
01:47:27.550 --> 01:47:29.860
but they still kept coming for the rest of the night.

1755
01:47:29.861 --> 01:47:33.160
The Chinese came up at us like waves to the shore,

1756
01:47:34.240 --> 01:47:37.270
but each time we stopped them,
they never reached the perimeter.

1757
01:47:38.410 --> 01:47:42.340
The next morning we took stock of our situation.
Water and food were a problem,

1758
01:47:42.490 --> 01:47:46.480
but ammunition and the wounded were our biggest concern.

1759
01:47:47.470 --> 01:47:52.470
We had 85 able bodied men left out of about 200 the rest were dead or wounded.

1760
01:47:56.860 --> 01:48:00.250
We were also out of morphine and the screams of the wounded,

1761
01:48:00.490 --> 01:48:02.980
we're starting to have an impact on the rest of the men.

1762
01:48:03.940 --> 01:48:04.380
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

1763
01:48:04.380 --> 01:48:08.070
<v 0>I could see in their eyes a tired haggard look.</v>

1764
01:48:08.980 --> 01:48:09.813
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

1765
01:48:09.830 --> 01:48:12.500
<v 0>a relief.
Calm is calling for us.
They'll get through today.</v>

1766
01:48:12.501 --> 01:48:14.120
I told the man as I walked the line,

1767
01:48:14.960 --> 01:48:19.940
I said it over and over again hoping to calm them and as I realized in
hindsight,

1768
01:48:20.150 --> 01:48:22.160
probably hoping to convince myself,

1769
01:48:23.180 --> 01:48:23.750
<v 1>okay,</v>

1770
01:48:23.750 --> 01:48:25.170
<v 0>I hope to hell I was right.</v>

1771
01:48:29.920 --> 01:48:30.753
Now

1772
01:48:32.560 --> 01:48:37.560
this is just a little report again about chaplain coupon and he gets a report.

1773
01:48:40.590 --> 01:48:43.150
Um,
Richardson gets a report and it says this,

1774
01:48:43.151 --> 01:48:45.580
the doc said that when the Chinese got into the Dugout,

1775
01:48:45.940 --> 01:48:49.930
chaplain coupon stopped them from killing all the wounded by surrendering

1776
01:48:49.931 --> 01:48:53.800
himself.
The Chinese took him and 15 of the walking wounded,

1777
01:48:54.070 --> 01:48:56.560
including my old company commander,
Captain Mccabe.

1778
01:48:57.540 --> 01:48:58.080
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1779
01:48:58.080 --> 01:49:01.530
<v 0>What coupon did was heroic stopping the Chinese</v>

1780
01:49:03.570 --> 01:49:08.030
when he left,
he was carrying Sergeant Miller.
So chaplain coupon.

1781
01:49:08.560 --> 01:49:10.350
This once again,

1782
01:49:11.190 --> 01:49:15.960
heroic actions saving the lives of these guys before they were slaughtered by

1783
01:49:15.961 --> 01:49:17.700
the Chinese,
by surrendering himself.

1784
01:49:21.660 --> 01:49:22.351
When I got back,

1785
01:49:22.351 --> 01:49:25.500
I organized about a dozen guys to follow me out of the perimeter and gather up

1786
01:49:25.501 --> 01:49:27.630
some of the Chinese weapons and ammunition.

1787
01:49:28.140 --> 01:49:32.190
We were out of almost everything but lying in front of us were weapons and

1788
01:49:32.191 --> 01:49:35.640
ammunition including much needed grenades.
Before we left,

1789
01:49:35.641 --> 01:49:39.030
I told the men to be careful because some of the Chinese might still be alive.

1790
01:49:39.450 --> 01:49:40.920
It was gruesome business,

1791
01:49:41.190 --> 01:49:46.140
but the only solution to our most pressing problem crawling over piles of dead

1792
01:49:46.141 --> 01:49:49.510
Chinese.
The smell was overpowering at time.

1793
01:49:49.511 --> 01:49:53.230
I could hear gas seep out of the decaying corpses.

1794
01:49:54.820 --> 01:49:58.930
I could hear men behind me gag and throw up.

1795
01:50:00.280 --> 01:50:03.940
Yeah,
so this is like a,
this is like you've got to sit around,
you got to,

1796
01:50:04.150 --> 01:50:06.250
you got to imagine what this is like that they are.

1797
01:50:06.280 --> 01:50:11.280
The Chinese attackers are literally stacked and piled on top of one another and

1798
01:50:12.581 --> 01:50:17.581
you're so low that you have to go out and gather weapons and ammunition from

1799
01:50:18.011 --> 01:50:22.120
them and as you're doing that,
they're bloated.

1800
01:50:22.121 --> 01:50:27.121
Bodies are giving off gases and it's the smells so horrible and the whole scene

1801
01:50:28.271 --> 01:50:33.271
is so horrific that your men are dry heaving and throwing up as you're trying to

1802
01:50:33.821 --> 01:50:34.654
do this.

1803
01:50:42.000 --> 01:50:43.290
Back to the book for the rest of the morning,

1804
01:50:43.291 --> 01:50:47.160
we passed out our new trove of ammunition and dug in deeper as we worked,

1805
01:50:47.161 --> 01:50:49.320
I heard the faint buzz of an airplane overhead.

1806
01:50:49.620 --> 01:50:53.160
The spotter plane that had dropped a bags of medical supplies was back.

1807
01:50:53.161 --> 01:50:55.020
So I skipped over this part,
but there was a,

1808
01:50:55.110 --> 01:50:58.590
they got some medical supplies from a little plane and this time instead of

1809
01:50:58.591 --> 01:50:59.760
dropping supplies,

1810
01:51:00.120 --> 01:51:04.440
it dropped the message and this time the pilot dropped it on target.

1811
01:51:05.520 --> 01:51:10.520
Guru grow opened the message from one of the one of the other guys grow.

1812
01:51:11.520 --> 01:51:14.310
I hope I'm pronouncing that right.
G I r.
O.

1813
01:51:14.310 --> 01:51:16.710
U x grow opened the message.

1814
01:51:17.910 --> 01:51:19.860
I saw the color leave his face.

1815
01:51:21.390 --> 01:51:26.390
I knew what the message said before he told me we were on our own.

1816
01:51:27.840 --> 01:51:31.650
No relief column was on its way.
Our new order was simple.

1817
01:51:32.220 --> 01:51:36.090
We needed to get back to friendly lines the best way we could

1818
01:51:37.980 --> 01:51:40.320
while grow.
Got the officer's together.

1819
01:51:40.530 --> 01:51:44.310
I gathered up a few of the sergeants and we had a meeting.
Well,

1820
01:51:44.311 --> 01:51:48.180
we are on our own.
That message told us to get back the best way we can.

1821
01:51:48.181 --> 01:51:51.510
I told the Sergeants Wallach was the first one to speak up.

1822
01:51:51.511 --> 01:51:54.570
We can't just leave the wounded.
What the hell else are we going to do?

1823
01:51:54.571 --> 01:51:58.320
A sergeant I didn't recognize,
said the meeting was tense.

1824
01:51:59.160 --> 01:52:04.160
I realized that what I had been telling them was going to happen wasn't going to

1825
01:52:04.680 --> 01:52:09.180
no relief,
no rescue,
and if we stayed in this hell hole,

1826
01:52:10.050 --> 01:52:10.980
we would all die.

1827
01:52:12.750 --> 01:52:15.510
I don't think we can keep the Chinese out of the perimeter for one,

1828
01:52:15.600 --> 01:52:18.810
for more than one more night if we can even do that.
I said

1829
01:52:20.390 --> 01:52:24.210
there was silence.
We were facing death,

1830
01:52:25.020 --> 01:52:30.020
but bravery is a funny thing that comes in all shapes and sizes and appears in

1831
01:52:30.661 --> 01:52:34.770
men.
You would least expect it from
most of us.

1832
01:52:34.771 --> 01:52:39.120
Didn't know one another,
but we fought hard together like we were blood brothers.

1833
01:52:41.990 --> 01:52:44.180
What do you say about staying one more night?

1834
01:52:45.170 --> 01:52:48.890
Maybe somehow they'll break through Louis tomorrow.
I said,

1835
01:52:50.150 --> 01:52:53.110
tomorrow we talk about the wounded

1836
01:52:55.060 --> 01:52:58.690
Wallach nodded his head and looked at the others,
um,
for staying one more night,

1837
01:52:59.950 --> 01:53:03.520
everyone quickly agreed.
No one wanted to leave the wounded.

1838
01:53:04.570 --> 01:53:08.430
I told grow the way the men felt and after he met with Bronzer,

1839
01:53:08.450 --> 01:53:10.120
Mayo and Peterson,
they all agreed.

1840
01:53:10.330 --> 01:53:14.170
No one was comfortable leaving our wounded or the wounded nearby in the

1841
01:53:14.171 --> 01:53:15.400
battalion headquarters,

1842
01:53:17.340 --> 01:53:19.560
the Chinese that night,

1843
01:53:19.561 --> 01:53:22.830
the Chinese attack three times and three times we held,

1844
01:53:23.670 --> 01:53:28.440
but not without suffering more casualties.
After the last attack,

1845
01:53:28.620 --> 01:53:31.620
I literally fell into a hole near the center of the perimeter.

1846
01:53:31.980 --> 01:53:35.280
I was fighting a losing battle against sleep.

1847
01:53:37.020 --> 01:53:41.880
I could feel myself slipping away.
My body felt numb,
damp and heavy.

1848
01:53:43.450 --> 01:53:43.750
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1849
01:53:43.750 --> 01:53:45.610
<v 0>There was no noise,
no sound.</v>

1850
01:53:47.290 --> 01:53:50.410
I was paralyzed and the harder I tried to move,
the more I felt,

1851
01:53:50.470 --> 01:53:55.210
the more my body felt like stone.
I tried to scream nothing.

1852
01:53:55.540 --> 01:53:57.820
I tried harder.
I couldn't make a sound

1853
01:53:59.600 --> 01:54:03.170
bugles and the distance cleared my hazy mind.

1854
01:54:04.130 --> 01:54:07.470
I could hear the Burp Burp of Chinese sub machine guns,
but the cop,

1855
01:54:07.520 --> 01:54:10.850
but not the constant rattle of our own machine gun closest to me.

1856
01:54:11.570 --> 01:54:13.100
I instantly got a sick feeling.

1857
01:54:13.280 --> 01:54:16.460
I bolted out of the trench and crawled toward the machine gun position and fell

1858
01:54:16.461 --> 01:54:17.241
into the whole head.

1859
01:54:17.241 --> 01:54:21.590
First the gunner was wounded and the assistant gunner was trying to put the gun

1860
01:54:21.591 --> 01:54:25.370
back into action.
There was Ammo,
but the gun was jammed.

1861
01:54:25.580 --> 01:54:28.820
I racked it back.
Nothing.
The headspace was screwed up.

1862
01:54:29.630 --> 01:54:30.930
The Chinese were the worthy.

1863
01:54:31.300 --> 01:54:34.940
The Chinese were within 20 yards of us and I was screaming for the men to keep

1864
01:54:34.941 --> 01:54:38.600
firing.
I pulled the gun into the hole and started to take it apart.

1865
01:54:38.870 --> 01:54:40.310
I adjusted the headspace,

1866
01:54:40.490 --> 01:54:44.600
put the barrel and chamber and alignment and reassembled it.
The Aa Garner,

1867
01:54:44.690 --> 01:54:48.830
the assistant gunner,
laid the ammo belt in and slap the cover down.

1868
01:54:49.540 --> 01:54:53.390
I rock the boat back and pulled the trigger.
The gun jumped back to life.

1869
01:54:53.750 --> 01:54:57.680
The fire immediately had an impact and drove a wedge into the advancing
soldiers.

1870
01:54:57.830 --> 01:55:01.040
The first book,
the first burst took out half a dozen.

1871
01:55:02.030 --> 01:55:04.940
Some of the wounded and dead Chinese fell into our trenches.

1872
01:55:05.240 --> 01:55:07.130
Others crumbled in a heap near the edge,

1873
01:55:07.131 --> 01:55:09.560
close enough that we could reach out and touch them.

1874
01:55:11.240 --> 01:55:14.030
I looked down and saw that the gunner was dead.

1875
01:55:14.600 --> 01:55:18.410
The aid gunner was hit in the arms and I could see blood staining is fatigue

1876
01:55:18.411 --> 01:55:19.010
jacket,

1877
01:55:19.010 --> 01:55:22.850
but he kept firing his rifle and replacing ammo belts when the machine gun went

1878
01:55:22.851 --> 01:55:23.684
dry.

1879
01:55:25.290 --> 01:55:25.880
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1880
01:55:25.880 --> 01:55:28.520
<v 0>Just as fast as it started,
the attack ended.</v>

1881
01:55:29.690 --> 01:55:33.170
There were some sporadic firing from the other side of the perimeter.

1882
01:55:34.070 --> 01:55:38.150
A couple of guys close to the gun position came over to me and took over.

1883
01:55:39.200 --> 01:55:40.670
As I headed back to my hole,

1884
01:55:41.240 --> 01:55:44.430
I crawled over several dead American and Chinese.

1885
01:55:45.700 --> 01:55:46.280
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

1886
01:55:46.280 --> 01:55:51.080
<v 0>Every trench and whole seem to be filled with wounded men screaming and crying</v>

1887
01:55:51.081 --> 01:55:51.920
for their mothers,

1888
01:55:55.280 --> 01:55:56.390
always their mothers.

1889
01:55:59.360 --> 01:56:04.040
We had an added problem now since some of the wounded war Chinese soldiers.

1890
01:56:04.970 --> 01:56:05.290
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

1891
01:56:05.290 --> 01:56:08.950
<v 0>the dead.
We're not a problem.
We just pushed them out in front of the trench,</v>

1892
01:56:09.160 --> 01:56:11.200
but the wounded we had to help if we could.

1893
01:56:13.550 --> 01:56:16.850
The medics did their best,
but we barely had enough for grown men.

1894
01:56:18.120 --> 01:56:18.850
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1895
01:56:18.850 --> 01:56:22.270
<v 0>The Chinese were all scared to death,
crying and moaning.</v>

1896
01:56:24.910 --> 01:56:29.230
They were the enemy,
but they were also soldiers just like us.

1897
01:56:30.270 --> 01:56:30.740
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1898
01:56:30.740 --> 01:56:33.260
<v 0>And it was difficult to see them that way.</v>

1899
01:56:41.740 --> 01:56:45.670
The next morning,
Brahms or in Guerrero called me over to them,

1900
01:56:46.510 --> 01:56:49.180
the two artillery lieutenants,
Mayo and Peterson.
We're also,

1901
01:56:49.181 --> 01:56:51.130
their Gross said what we all knew.

1902
01:56:51.730 --> 01:56:52.140
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

1903
01:56:52.140 --> 01:56:53.550
<v 0>we can't stay here any longer.</v>

1904
01:56:53.790 --> 01:56:57.330
There is no doubt in my mind that the Chinese will overrun us tonight.
He said,

1905
01:56:57.870 --> 01:57:02.810
we need to find a way out.
We'll leave.
Will you lead a patrol lieutenant?

1906
01:57:02.811 --> 01:57:05.580
Mayo and Peterson have already volunteered to go.

1907
01:57:07.500 --> 01:57:10.410
I looked at the lieutenants and nodded my head yes.

1908
01:57:12.810 --> 01:57:17.810
So they're going to try and find a way out of this perimeter and they're doing

1909
01:57:21.091 --> 01:57:24.840
to do a little reconnaissance tonight or or now to try and figure out their

1910
01:57:24.841 --> 01:57:29.010
route so that then later they can get out of there and come up with a plan to

1911
01:57:29.011 --> 01:57:32.320
get out of there,
back to the book as we grow.

1912
01:57:32.350 --> 01:57:35.400
And so they're crawling down a trench to try and look for the,
for the way out.

1913
01:57:35.910 --> 01:57:38.760
As we crawled down the trench toward the east side,

1914
01:57:38.761 --> 01:57:40.980
word got out that we were going on patrol.

1915
01:57:41.860 --> 01:57:42.200
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1916
01:57:42.200 --> 01:57:46.190
<v 0>Peterson crawled by a badly wounded radio operator,
Lieutenant Peterson,</v>

1917
01:57:46.310 --> 01:57:50.060
where are you going?
Looking for a way out.
He said,

1918
01:57:51.080 --> 01:57:55.040
Lieutenant Peterson,
the radio operator,
pleated,
please don't leave me here.

1919
01:57:55.160 --> 01:57:59.270
Please don't leave me.
You can't leave me here for them to get me.

1920
01:58:00.660 --> 01:58:01.290
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

1921
01:58:01.290 --> 01:58:04.500
<v 0>Peterson looked shaken and I urged us forward.</v>

1922
01:58:04.830 --> 01:58:07.920
I heard him say he was sorry.
As we crawled off.

1923
01:58:08.990 --> 01:58:09.670
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

1924
01:58:09.670 --> 01:58:12.370
<v 0>others reached out to us,
patted us on the back</v>

1925
01:58:14.140 --> 01:58:15.370
and wished us good luck.

1926
01:58:16.250 --> 01:58:17.110
<v 1>Okay.
Okay.</v>

1927
01:58:17.540 --> 01:58:19.880
<v 0>As we move down the river bed,
the Chinese soldiers</v>

1928
01:58:21.190 --> 01:58:24.700
grabbed it us and held out cops begging for water.

1929
01:58:25.930 --> 01:58:29.680
I took my canteen and turned it upside down to show them that we had no water,

1930
01:58:29.681 --> 01:58:33.280
so there's the enemy.
They're also wounded laying in these trenches.

1931
01:58:33.370 --> 01:58:38.370
It's just a total blood bath and the Chinese soldiers are asking these Americans

1932
01:58:39.670 --> 01:58:42.370
and he couldn't even imagine what guys look like at this point.

1933
01:58:42.790 --> 01:58:47.290
They'd been fighting for weeks on end.
They have no water.
They've had no food.

1934
01:58:47.291 --> 01:58:49.270
They're out ammunition there covered in blood.

1935
01:58:49.390 --> 01:58:54.250
I mean Richardson's actually wounded
and his,

1936
01:58:54.251 --> 01:58:55.540
sorry state,
they're in.

1937
01:58:55.720 --> 01:58:59.680
You've got the Chinese soldiers that are even worse state begging for water.

1938
01:59:02.250 --> 01:59:03.083
<v 1>Okay,</v>

1939
01:59:03.440 --> 01:59:08.120
<v 0>so these guys find a route and I don't wanna make it sound like they found some</v>

1940
01:59:08.121 --> 01:59:10.130
easy escape route that's going to work.

1941
01:59:10.160 --> 01:59:12.950
They found a possible way of getting out of this perimeter.

1942
01:59:14.270 --> 01:59:17.780
And when they get back
they,

1943
01:59:19.160 --> 01:59:23.120
they come back and put out the word like,
okay,

1944
01:59:23.210 --> 01:59:28.210
this is what we're going to try and do and to grow talk.

1945
01:59:28.971 --> 01:59:31.970
And he says,
we move at 1700 before the Chinese move in.

1946
01:59:32.240 --> 01:59:36.680
Gross said word was passed to all able bodied men.

1947
01:59:37.940 --> 01:59:41.900
They were told to make sure that they took what ammunition they had left.

1948
01:59:43.190 --> 01:59:45.440
I got a burp gun and some ammo.

1949
01:59:48.240 --> 01:59:50.130
The wounded men knew what was happening.

1950
01:59:52.170 --> 01:59:55.800
Some broke down,
cried and begged us not to leave.

1951
01:59:56.910 --> 02:00:01.890
Please,
dear God,
take us.
One soldier begged me,
grabbing at my shirt.

1952
02:00:02.010 --> 02:00:03.600
Don't leave us to the Chinese.

1953
02:00:06.250 --> 02:00:09.220
Others just watched in silence.

1954
02:00:10.730 --> 02:00:12.200
They knew they'd slow us down.

1955
02:00:14.710 --> 02:00:17.260
They also knew that they'd be dead soon.

1956
02:00:19.450 --> 02:00:21.430
They simply asked that we come back for them,

1957
02:00:24.230 --> 02:00:27.860
but I knew we were leaving them to die or worse get captured.

1958
02:00:29.170 --> 02:00:32.110
I knew my orders and agreed with them,

1959
02:00:34.080 --> 02:00:37.200
but I couldn't shake the feeling that I was leaving.
So many good men,

1960
02:00:38.340 --> 02:00:41.520
men who'd fought well only to be left behind to die.

1961
02:00:44.020 --> 02:00:47.740
I wasn't sure I could ever forget this.

1962
02:00:49.840 --> 02:00:53.530
Miss was the hardest thing I had done in my short lifetime.

1963
02:00:57.500 --> 02:00:58.333
<v 1>Okay,</v>

1964
02:00:59.330 --> 02:01:04.100
<v 0>this is your classic scenario of May.
What do we do?
We do.</v>

1965
02:01:04.101 --> 02:01:05.990
We know we leave no man behind,

1966
02:01:06.560 --> 02:01:10.520
so then what's going to happen if they do that is everyone is going to die

1967
02:01:12.610 --> 02:01:14.710
and they make the decision.
Now,

1968
02:01:14.800 --> 02:01:19.780
we could have a theoretical debate on,
well,
maybe if they fought it out,

1969
02:01:19.781 --> 02:01:21.010
maybe if they stuck together,

1970
02:01:22.000 --> 02:01:26.080
maybe they could defeat the Chinese that are surrounding them.

1971
02:01:27.130 --> 02:01:28.150
In my estimation,

1972
02:01:29.650 --> 02:01:33.430
this is wrong and you can see these guys already stayed longer and they've

1973
02:01:33.431 --> 02:01:34.780
already done everything that they can.

1974
02:01:34.781 --> 02:01:36.700
They're out of ammunition there surrounded by Chinese.

1975
02:01:36.701 --> 02:01:41.060
The Chinese have unlimited number of men that are literally in piles around them

1976
02:01:42.660 --> 02:01:47.190
and they know that if they are going to,
if anyone is going to survive,

1977
02:01:48.270 --> 02:01:52.940
the need to make a break for it and again,
it's theoretical for us it,

1978
02:01:52.941 --> 02:01:55.650
it's sitting here,
it's hypothetical.
We could say all,
we'd stay in fight,

1979
02:01:55.651 --> 02:01:58.830
we could say whatever you want to say right now,
you're not in that position.

1980
02:02:05.040 --> 02:02:09.990
So now they leave at around five o'clock they start making a move.

1981
02:02:10.110 --> 02:02:12.870
A few hours into the march the rain turned into a downpour.

1982
02:02:12.871 --> 02:02:14.310
In minutes we were soaked to the skin,

1983
02:02:14.311 --> 02:02:17.130
the temperature was dropping and started and I started to shiver.

1984
02:02:17.610 --> 02:02:19.350
Moving was the only way to stay warm.

1985
02:02:19.351 --> 02:02:23.100
I pushed on trying to get as many miles as possible between us and the old

1986
02:02:23.101 --> 02:02:23.934
perimeter.

1987
02:02:24.420 --> 02:02:28.590
We were well behind Chinese lines and because of the size of our group it was

1988
02:02:28.591 --> 02:02:33.510
likely that we'd be spotted soon.
Now this is interesting trying to move with,

1989
02:02:33.540 --> 02:02:36.030
I think they said they had an 80 able bodied man.

1990
02:02:36.031 --> 02:02:39.030
Maybe it's 60 that's a massive number of people.

1991
02:02:39.510 --> 02:02:43.920
You can't hide 60 people.
It doesn't work.
You can,
well,

1992
02:02:44.190 --> 02:02:47.490
I shouldn't say you can't.
It's very,
very difficult to hide.

1993
02:02:47.491 --> 02:02:52.200
60 people like a platoon of 40 guys like it.
It's hard.
You know,

1994
02:02:52.201 --> 02:02:55.320
in the seal teams we have little tiny elements to little tiny platoons,

1995
02:02:55.321 --> 02:02:58.590
a 16 guys.
You can find some terrain that will,

1996
02:02:59.100 --> 02:03:03.960
that will hide you wheeze work in squads with eight guys.
Like,
okay,

1997
02:03:03.961 --> 02:03:05.400
we can,
we can find a place to hide.

1998
02:03:05.550 --> 02:03:09.320
When you have 60 or 80 guys behind enemy lines,

1999
02:03:09.450 --> 02:03:11.160
that's going to be a challenge.
I mean,

2000
02:03:11.161 --> 02:03:13.350
just think about where can you hide though that many people,

2001
02:03:13.740 --> 02:03:18.150
like a perfect terrain,
feature a ravine,
you know,
something like that.

2002
02:03:18.540 --> 02:03:21.970
That's a lot of people to put into a ravine and just the noise discipline of

2003
02:03:21.990 --> 02:03:24.900
people.
You know who,
who's gonna Cough,
you get 60 people,

2004
02:03:25.260 --> 02:03:26.160
someone's going to cough.

2005
02:03:26.310 --> 02:03:29.370
I mean just you and me sitting in this room and we noticed when one of us costs

2006
02:03:29.371 --> 02:03:34.140
because we're one to one of us grunts or whatever because we're recording it.

2007
02:03:34.660 --> 02:03:36.360
Yeah,
but you think about w you know,

2008
02:03:36.361 --> 02:03:38.460
you and I sitting here for two hours for three hours.

2009
02:03:38.790 --> 02:03:42.930
I would say five times during that one of us will cough.

2010
02:03:43.950 --> 02:03:47.080
Right?
And you got to go edit it out.
Sure.

2011
02:03:47.400 --> 02:03:49.440
So if that's happening with two of us,

2012
02:03:49.770 --> 02:03:54.770
you put 80 people into a ravine where they're trying to hide from the enemy and

2013
02:03:55.381 --> 02:04:00.000
there's how many people are coughing.
You know how many people are,
are sneezing,

2014
02:04:00.710 --> 02:04:05.160
right?
And it's not,
it's not good odds.
And that's where these guys are saying,

2015
02:04:05.210 --> 02:04:06.540
he is Richardson saying,
look,

2016
02:04:06.541 --> 02:04:09.660
we have a massive group and it's not going to be easy to,
uh,
to hide

2017
02:04:11.820 --> 02:04:14.700
back to the book.
We need to get moving to take advantage of the dark.

2018
02:04:17.130 --> 02:04:19.800
I left the house,
they'd been a little house.
Speaking of hiding,

2019
02:04:20.070 --> 02:04:23.790
I left the house frustrated sergeant mayor from the battalion's intelligence

2020
02:04:23.791 --> 02:04:26.160
section called me over.
Let's get outta here.
He said,

2021
02:04:26.580 --> 02:04:29.310
you and I have a better chance to get back to this group is too large.

2022
02:04:29.520 --> 02:04:32.040
We don't have the fire power to fight and they're slowing us down.

2023
02:04:33.030 --> 02:04:33.470
<v 2>Okay,</v>

2024
02:04:33.470 --> 02:04:37.410
<v 0>sorry.
Here's a guy saying,
let bro.
Let's just make a run for it.
He was right.</v>

2025
02:04:38.370 --> 02:04:42.150
I knew that we'd probably make it back to friendly lines together.

2026
02:04:42.930 --> 02:04:45.870
Breaking down into smaller groups would be better,

2027
02:04:47.070 --> 02:04:50.940
but I'd helped shepherd these men too far to turn my back on them.

2028
02:04:51.120 --> 02:04:55.860
Even if it costs me my life.
Sorry,
can't do it.

2029
02:04:57.180 --> 02:05:00.360
Mayor shrugged and disappeared into the darkness.

2030
02:05:00.570 --> 02:05:04.030
So exactly what I just said.
This guy made the decision.
You know what?

2031
02:05:04.170 --> 02:05:06.840
Now going alone,
that's not a good idea either.
You know,

2032
02:05:06.870 --> 02:05:10.320
cause now you've got no one to support you.
You've got no one to watch your six.

2033
02:05:10.321 --> 02:05:12.390
I mean that's just a bad idea.
You can't,

2034
02:05:12.420 --> 02:05:15.060
you're going to need to sleep at some point and you're by yourself.

2035
02:05:15.510 --> 02:05:18.150
What happens when you start snoring?
Right?

2036
02:05:19.320 --> 02:05:21.600
But this guy figured I've got a better chance of doing this by myself,

2037
02:05:21.601 --> 02:05:24.750
so I'm going to break out.
Now you could have given an order like,
hey everyone,

2038
02:05:25.020 --> 02:05:27.960
there's something called the escape and evasion when you're just,

2039
02:05:28.140 --> 02:05:32.370
everyone's basically every man for himself.
You could do that.

2040
02:05:32.820 --> 02:05:37.050
But at this point Richardson is like,
Hey,
we made it this far.

2041
02:05:37.470 --> 02:05:41.430
We're going to,
we're going to stick together.
Back to the book.

2042
02:05:41.460 --> 02:05:43.530
My group climb to the top of the knoll.

2043
02:05:43.560 --> 02:05:47.040
I could see the rounds hitting a mountain no more than five miles away.

2044
02:05:47.250 --> 02:05:49.740
We were close for the first time.
I felt hope.

2045
02:05:51.180 --> 02:05:54.510
Then the halo erupted with machine gun and mortar fire.

2046
02:05:54.720 --> 02:05:56.190
I was knocked flat on my face.

2047
02:05:56.191 --> 02:06:00.000
I quickly got up and just as quickly got back down in the prone position,

2048
02:06:00.150 --> 02:06:01.770
the Chinese were shelling the hill.

2049
02:06:01.890 --> 02:06:06.450
My lower back felt wet and I could feel what I thought was sweat running down

2050
02:06:06.451 --> 02:06:10.530
the crack of my ass.
It wasn't sweat.
They was blood.

2051
02:06:11.430 --> 02:06:14.550
I was hit,
but I didn't feel anything.
There was so much smoke,
dirt,

2052
02:06:14.551 --> 02:06:17.760
and dust that I could barely see.
I stumbled off the hill,

2053
02:06:17.761 --> 02:06:22.470
followed by three others.
There were about a dozen Chinese soldiers chasing us.

2054
02:06:22.680 --> 02:06:24.570
I prided myself to think and move.

2055
02:06:24.810 --> 02:06:27.870
We started to head for a village on the other side of the road behind the

2056
02:06:27.871 --> 02:06:31.260
village.
I could see a massive rice patty that ran up to a hill.

2057
02:06:31.410 --> 02:06:34.320
I figured we could escape it if we got over the hill first.

2058
02:06:35.370 --> 02:06:38.010
The Patty had about three or four inches of water in it.

2059
02:06:38.190 --> 02:06:42.000
We stayed on the tops of the dikes and got halfway across the patty before I

2060
02:06:42.060 --> 02:06:46.980
turned to fire back.
The Chinese soldiers dove for cover.

2061
02:06:47.100 --> 02:06:50.730
When they did,
we started running again.
As I was running,

2062
02:06:50.850 --> 02:06:53.460
I saw a rounds hitting the water in front of me.

2063
02:06:57.470 --> 02:06:58.370
It's not good.

2064
02:07:01.160 --> 02:07:02.930
When we got to the other side,

2065
02:07:03.230 --> 02:07:07.430
we got down behind the dike and started firing at the Chinese again.

2066
02:07:07.580 --> 02:07:11.750
I didn't see anyone behind them.
If we could take them out,
we had a chance,

2067
02:07:12.710 --> 02:07:14.060
but the others didn't have it.

2068
02:07:14.061 --> 02:07:18.710
Any ammunition left and I was down to a few rounds myself.

2069
02:07:20.220 --> 02:07:23.250
Get going.
I said,
I'll hold them off.

2070
02:07:24.630 --> 02:07:26.790
They looked at me for a second go.

2071
02:07:26.880 --> 02:07:31.290
I screamed and turn toward the Chinese soldiers.
Crossing the Patty.

2072
02:07:32.700 --> 02:07:36.190
I fired a few shots and then dove behind a dyke.
A few seconds later,

2073
02:07:36.191 --> 02:07:39.130
I fired two more bursts before I was out of ammunition

2074
02:07:41.360 --> 02:07:43.880
between burst,
my mind was searching for an escape route.

2075
02:07:45.050 --> 02:07:46.670
I knew that if I ran straight up the hill,

2076
02:07:46.671 --> 02:07:50.690
I didn't stand a chance about 30 yards to my right.
There was a house,

2077
02:07:50.990 --> 02:07:54.590
a woman and a baby were crying and wailing in a dug out near the hill.

2078
02:07:54.830 --> 02:07:57.080
I went into the house.
If I wanted into the house,

2079
02:07:57.500 --> 02:07:59.270
I was sure the woman would tell them,

2080
02:07:59.840 --> 02:08:03.290
but I couldn't stay behind the dike with no ammunition.
Jumping up,

2081
02:08:03.470 --> 02:08:06.080
I ran behind the house and started up the hill.

2082
02:08:06.200 --> 02:08:09.620
I tried to keep the house at my back hoping to mask my movement.

2083
02:08:10.550 --> 02:08:14.270
I went as far as I could go without the Chinese seeing me and then dove into a

2084
02:08:14.271 --> 02:08:19.271
large Bush rolling onto my stomach with my Chinese burp gun underneath me.

2085
02:08:19.580 --> 02:08:22.700
I waited.
I had no Ammo,

2086
02:08:22.880 --> 02:08:27.200
but I had a death grip on the weapon.
It was like my security blanket.

2087
02:08:28.790 --> 02:08:31.250
I could hear the Chinese soldiers climbing up the hill.

2088
02:08:31.490 --> 02:08:35.570
They were yelling at one another.
I was trying not to move,

2089
02:08:36.200 --> 02:08:40.460
not even breathe,
a fly hovered around my face,

2090
02:08:40.461 --> 02:08:45.290
landing on my nose and mouth.
I tried to keep my mind close to everything.

2091
02:08:46.880 --> 02:08:51.440
I closed my eyes as they passed and took my first breath.
As I heard,

2092
02:08:51.441 --> 02:08:55.100
they're yelling behind me in a few minutes.

2093
02:08:55.790 --> 02:09:00.500
I was sure they were gone,
but every unit has one,

2094
02:09:01.760 --> 02:09:03.950
a straggler that can't keep up.

2095
02:09:05.300 --> 02:09:09.440
The Chinese straggler was so slow.
Then when he got close to the Bush,

2096
02:09:10.100 --> 02:09:14.600
he saw me.
I never moved and just shut my eyes.

2097
02:09:14.840 --> 02:09:17.420
He started to Holler to drove his bayonet into my,

2098
02:09:17.421 --> 02:09:19.670
but I felt the TTIP hit the bone.

2099
02:09:21.880 --> 02:09:26.140
When I opened my eyes,
I saw boots all around me.
My mind went to the BURP gun.

2100
02:09:27.520 --> 02:09:30.700
If I rolled over holding it,
they'd shoot me for sure.

2101
02:09:32.450 --> 02:09:35.810
I shot my arms out along the ground and rolled over,

2102
02:09:35.990 --> 02:09:37.610
leaving the burp gun in the mud.

2103
02:09:39.330 --> 02:09:41.100
They reached down and jerked me up.

2104
02:09:49.310 --> 02:09:53.840
The barrel of the pistol looked like the business end of 105 millimeter
howitzer,

2105
02:09:54.050 --> 02:09:58.130
a Chinese officer with red piping down the side of his pants had the pistol

2106
02:09:58.131 --> 02:09:59.750
pressed between my eyes.

2107
02:09:59.990 --> 02:10:02.630
He was screaming at me and Chinese and pointing up the hill.

2108
02:10:02.990 --> 02:10:06.590
I was numb and couldn't speak.
I lifted my shoulders and let them drop.

2109
02:10:06.890 --> 02:10:10.160
I thought of this moment many times,

2110
02:10:11.690 --> 02:10:15.290
and I know that if he pulled the trigger,
I would never have known it.

2111
02:10:16.940 --> 02:10:18.140
That would've been the end.

2112
02:10:19.530 --> 02:10:19.920
<v 1>Okay.</v>

2113
02:10:19.920 --> 02:10:22.320
<v 0>I'd been captured now when I had no idea what to do,</v>

2114
02:10:22.530 --> 02:10:24.930
at least when I was on the run,
I knew where I was going.

2115
02:10:24.960 --> 02:10:28.560
Even fighting for my life was easier than giving up all control.

2116
02:10:31.190 --> 02:10:34.190
I was now at the mercy of the Chinese,

2117
02:10:36.490 --> 02:10:39.280
<v 2>so there you go.
Captured</v>

2118
02:10:39.630 --> 02:10:43.180
<v 0>did fought until he's literally out of ammunition and</v>

2119
02:10:44.910 --> 02:10:48.390
<v 2>there's nothing else he could do.
Hmm.
Nothing else he can do</v>

2120
02:10:52.380 --> 02:10:55.170
<v 0>ends up.
They must have some other guys that got captured.</v>

2121
02:10:55.171 --> 02:10:57.840
They muster them all together.
Now we're going back to the book.

2122
02:10:57.841 --> 02:11:01.560
There were about 10 Chinese guards.
They lined up us.

2123
02:11:01.800 --> 02:11:05.880
They lined up beside us and moved us down the road a couple hundred yards.

2124
02:11:06.000 --> 02:11:10.080
Suddenly the one in the lead started yelling in.
The whole column stopped.

2125
02:11:11.220 --> 02:11:11.770
<v 2>Okay.</v>

2126
02:11:11.770 --> 02:11:16.120
<v 0>The graph,
the guards grabbed us and made us kneel down in front of a ditch.</v>

2127
02:11:17.500 --> 02:11:21.280
I could hear one of the soldiers barking.
What sounded bike orders in Chinese.

2128
02:11:22.630 --> 02:11:24.100
My mind went on full alert.

2129
02:11:25.530 --> 02:11:25.860
<v 2>Okay.</v>

2130
02:11:25.860 --> 02:11:27.510
<v 0>They were going to execute us.</v>

2131
02:11:28.660 --> 02:11:29.320
<v 2>Okay.</v>

2132
02:11:29.320 --> 02:11:32.800
<v 0>I felt the guy next to me shaking and another started sobbing.</v>

2133
02:11:33.940 --> 02:11:35.530
My God,
this is it.

2134
02:11:36.460 --> 02:11:40.330
This is one of those situations where you expect to see your life flash before

2135
02:11:40.331 --> 02:11:44.860
your eyes.
I was ready to relieve really of scenes from my childhood,

2136
02:11:45.430 --> 02:11:46.810
good times in Austria,

2137
02:11:46.960 --> 02:11:50.830
anything to take my mind from Korea and this ditch.

2138
02:11:52.350 --> 02:11:52.950
<v 2>Okay.</v>

2139
02:11:52.950 --> 02:11:54.000
<v 0>It didn't happen to me.</v>

2140
02:11:54.840 --> 02:11:55.400
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

2141
02:11:55.400 --> 02:11:56.750
<v 0>I just closed my eyes</v>

2142
02:11:59.530 --> 02:12:02.770
instead of shots.
I heard laughing.

2143
02:12:04.620 --> 02:12:06.090
They motioned for us to get up.

2144
02:12:06.720 --> 02:12:10.230
The guy next to me was so emotionally drained that he couldn't get up.

2145
02:12:10.440 --> 02:12:14.490
I tried to help him,
but my hands were tied behind my back.
Get up,
I yelled,

2146
02:12:15.450 --> 02:12:19.630
don't let them laugh at you.
Get up.

2147
02:12:26.600 --> 02:12:31.600
They get to like a little building and they'd been carrying captured rifles this

2148
02:12:31.911 --> 02:12:35.810
whole time so they get to a little building in back to the book.

2149
02:12:35.811 --> 02:12:39.320
The Chinese dropped the pile of rice on the ground and motioned for us to eat
it.

2150
02:12:39.950 --> 02:12:43.040
The prisoners rushed in and started fighting over the grains.

2151
02:12:44.060 --> 02:12:47.210
I staggered back from the melee and angrily watched.

2152
02:12:47.390 --> 02:12:51.650
We've been turned into animals.
After all we'd been through.
Why were,

2153
02:12:51.740 --> 02:12:54.950
why were the others not helping one another?

2154
02:12:55.810 --> 02:12:56.230
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

2155
02:12:56.230 --> 02:12:59.320
<v 0>Instead,
they pushed and fought.
I refuse to join in.</v>

2156
02:12:59.620 --> 02:13:02.320
We needed leadership and control more than ever,

2157
02:13:02.440 --> 02:13:06.190
and I was going to begin leading by example.

2158
02:13:13.210 --> 02:13:16.300
So
they go to,

2159
02:13:16.960 --> 02:13:18.790
they get some initial interrogation.

2160
02:13:19.120 --> 02:13:22.720
Of course you don't have that mock execution.
Horrible.

2161
02:13:23.680 --> 02:13:28.060
And then he moves into the next chapter,
which is called death march.

2162
02:13:30.010 --> 02:13:33.390
We started north up the road at a good clip.

2163
02:13:33.600 --> 02:13:38.580
The guards circled us like sharks,
sharks,
pushing stragglers with their rifles,

2164
02:13:38.700 --> 02:13:42.510
hitting and kicking.
Anyone who stopped,
many in the group,
we'll wounded.

2165
02:13:43.110 --> 02:13:47.820
One man had a massive chest wound.
It was covered by bloodstain bandages.

2166
02:13:47.970 --> 02:13:50.310
He wheezed as he shuffled down the road,

2167
02:13:51.920 --> 02:13:56.180
my shoulder was a little stiff and the shrapnel in my back was wet and sticky.

2168
02:13:56.570 --> 02:13:59.150
But I felt lucky.
It was nothing in comparison.

2169
02:14:00.960 --> 02:14:01.793
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

2170
02:14:01.850 --> 02:14:04.130
<v 0>So yeah.
Next time you're thinking you have a rough day.</v>

2171
02:14:04.160 --> 02:14:08.240
How about you're a prisoner of war on a death march and you've got a massive

2172
02:14:08.241 --> 02:14:09.110
chest wound.

2173
02:14:12.310 --> 02:14:16.300
So now one of these,
some of the Chinese guards could speak English,

2174
02:14:16.630 --> 02:14:18.220
and here we go.
Pick up the wounded.

2175
02:14:19.240 --> 02:14:24.010
He kept saying in like a broken record guard started pushing us back toward the

2176
02:14:24.011 --> 02:14:25.990
back of the formation on the ground.

2177
02:14:26.080 --> 02:14:30.940
We're about 20 soldiers on Jerry rigged litters made out of burlap bags attached

2178
02:14:31.000 --> 02:14:34.480
and stretched between Poles.
10 more soldiers stood around them,

2179
02:14:35.140 --> 02:14:37.630
pick up the wounded.
The officer barked again.

2180
02:14:38.920 --> 02:14:40.780
It took four of us to carry one litter.

2181
02:14:40.930 --> 02:14:43.180
I grabbed the closes litter and hoisted it up.

2182
02:14:43.780 --> 02:14:46.930
The soldier and the litter had a horribly mangled leg,

2183
02:14:47.050 --> 02:14:52.050
has calf muscle was long gone and his foot rested on the inner limp on the

2184
02:14:52.931 --> 02:14:54.580
litter,
limp and lifeless.

2185
02:14:55.660 --> 02:14:58.300
None of the wounded men had seen a doctor since being captured.

2186
02:14:58.570 --> 02:15:02.050
I heard someone say they'd been in trucks but were dumped on the road when the

2187
02:15:02.051 --> 02:15:03.280
trucks were needed elsewhere.

2188
02:15:04.300 --> 02:15:07.480
A whistle sounded and we started to shuffle toward the men.

2189
02:15:07.810 --> 02:15:10.600
None of us were strong enough to carry the stretchers very long.

2190
02:15:10.780 --> 02:15:15.310
My shoulders burned.
I tried to focus on each step left right,

2191
02:15:15.490 --> 02:15:18.490
left,
right whenever things got tough,

2192
02:15:18.491 --> 02:15:22.840
my mind wandered back to the guy with the sucking chest wound or I stole a

2193
02:15:22.841 --> 02:15:27.640
glance at the guy on the litter with a mangled leg.
I vowed to never quit,

2194
02:15:28.930 --> 02:15:31.420
but soon my body started to break down.

2195
02:15:31.600 --> 02:15:33.730
I tried to get another prisoner to relieve me,

2196
02:15:33.880 --> 02:15:37.570
but everyone I asked looked away or move to ahead.

2197
02:15:38.470 --> 02:15:39.100
<v 1>Okay.</v>

2198
02:15:39.100 --> 02:15:39.850
<v 0>Most Hayden,</v>

2199
02:15:39.850 --> 02:15:43.000
the dark trying to stay as far away from the stretchers as they could.

2200
02:15:43.150 --> 02:15:47.650
You son of a bitch.
I barked at one soldier who almost jerked away when I asked.

2201
02:15:48.490 --> 02:15:49.510
I was disgusted.

2202
02:15:49.660 --> 02:15:53.080
It reminded me of the soldiers that first night fighting over the rice.

2203
02:15:53.230 --> 02:15:57.850
We'd forgotten that the backbone of any military was the bond of the soldiers.

2204
02:15:59.370 --> 02:16:01.500
We fought for the guys to our left and right.

2205
02:16:01.680 --> 02:16:06.680
That is why we fought to protect our unit buddies and we expected them to do the

2206
02:16:06.961 --> 02:16:10.880
same.
Put on a death march.

2207
02:16:11.060 --> 02:16:12.590
Every man was an island.

2208
02:16:14.110 --> 02:16:18.940
There seemed to be no place for anything else.
I refuse to be that way.

2209
02:16:26.810 --> 02:16:31.630
It's heavy burden.
Each night.
The guards were getting tougher.

2210
02:16:31.960 --> 02:16:34.270
They were constantly pushing and hitting men with the rifles.

2211
02:16:34.271 --> 02:16:37.420
If a man fell behind,
he was shot and pushed off the mountain side.

2212
02:16:38.290 --> 02:16:41.290
Everyone was rapidly losing weight,
lack of food,

2213
02:16:41.410 --> 02:16:45.280
wounds and dysentery.
We're taking their toll.

2214
02:16:46.120 --> 02:16:49.090
Carrying the men on stretchers was becoming even more difficult.

2215
02:16:49.091 --> 02:16:54.091
We looked like skeletons are uniforms hung off us like a scarecrows quote coat.

2216
02:16:54.400 --> 02:16:58.150
Each time we got topped,
each time we topped one of the mountains,

2217
02:16:58.151 --> 02:17:01.900
we faced another one.
Ears,
nose,
fingers,

2218
02:17:01.901 --> 02:17:03.820
and toes were becoming numb.

2219
02:17:04.990 --> 02:17:09.070
At times I felt like I was walking on my ankles.

2220
02:17:10.960 --> 02:17:14.860
I was lucky that my legs had always been the strongest part of my body.

2221
02:17:14.990 --> 02:17:18.280
Many of the wounded men who were strong enough to walk earlier,

2222
02:17:18.400 --> 02:17:22.030
we're now in the need of stretchers.
However,

2223
02:17:22.150 --> 02:17:26.050
there were none and we found ourselves carrying them along between two of us.

2224
02:17:26.230 --> 02:17:28.870
In some cases,
we are practically dragging them.

2225
02:17:30.220 --> 02:17:33.340
When I heard a single rifle shot back down the road,

2226
02:17:34.140 --> 02:17:35.120
<v 1>yeah,
yeah.</v>

2227
02:17:35.600 --> 02:17:37.490
<v 0>I knew another man's struggle was over.</v>

2228
02:17:38.810 --> 02:17:39.480
<v 1>Okay.</v>

2229
02:17:39.480 --> 02:17:42.090
<v 0>My heart was aching for them,
but at the same time,</v>

2230
02:17:42.091 --> 02:17:45.840
my mind kept telling me to move.
We had two choices,

2231
02:17:47.130 --> 02:17:49.410
March or die.

2232
02:17:55.790 --> 02:17:57.470
My survival mode kicked in,

2233
02:17:57.800 --> 02:18:01.130
not allowing me to surrender to pain and fatigue.

2234
02:18:02.670 --> 02:18:03.150
<v 1>Okay.</v>

2235
02:18:03.150 --> 02:18:06.150
<v 0>The guards shoved us into a cluster of hot,</v>

2236
02:18:06.151 --> 02:18:09.780
so after walking long time they get to dig into like a little village.

2237
02:18:09.870 --> 02:18:13.440
We were jammed into the room so tightly that my legs rested on another soldier.

2238
02:18:13.560 --> 02:18:16.800
The only thing good about sleeping this way was that we will warm or

2239
02:18:18.320 --> 02:18:23.320
a cold front from the plains of Manchuria came roaring down and slamming into

2240
02:18:23.791 --> 02:18:25.710
the very mountains we were struggling through.

2241
02:18:25.950 --> 02:18:29.040
We were facing the coldest winter in 50 years.

2242
02:18:31.110 --> 02:18:32.250
As we got ready to move out,

2243
02:18:32.251 --> 02:18:34.920
the commander of the guards told us to leave the stretchers.

2244
02:18:38.140 --> 02:18:41.830
The wounded were pleading with us to take them.

2245
02:18:43.840 --> 02:18:46.840
I started to move toward one and got a rifle button.
The Gut.

2246
02:18:47.050 --> 02:18:50.530
Others tried to grab the stretchers,
but the guards pushed them away too.

2247
02:18:53.030 --> 02:18:55.520
I started to move toward the helpless soldiers again,

2248
02:18:55.760 --> 02:18:57.410
but couldn't risk another blow.

2249
02:18:59.820 --> 02:19:04.590
I let my mind drift into a Zombie state hoping to block out the screams of the

2250
02:19:04.591 --> 02:19:09.050
wounded,
left foot,

2251
02:19:09.560 --> 02:19:12.740
right foot,
left foot,
right foot

2252
02:19:14.300 --> 02:19:15.620
over and over again.

2253
02:19:16.100 --> 02:19:20.150
I repeated it until I couldn't hear their screams.

2254
02:19:23.270 --> 02:19:24.103
<v 1>Cool.</v>

2255
02:19:35.180 --> 02:19:36.013
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

2256
02:19:41.160 --> 02:19:41.993
<v 0>absolutely.</v>

2257
02:19:47.780 --> 02:19:49.070
Just absolutely horrible.

2258
02:19:53.560 --> 02:19:58.120
After 10 nights,
we marched into a fairly good sized town

2259
02:20:01.360 --> 02:20:06.360
and this is when he decides that he's going to try and escape pretty early on

2260
02:20:07.750 --> 02:20:12.750
and he's got a couple buddies and there's some confusion and there's some chaos

2261
02:20:13.001 --> 02:20:17.830
that that happens as they're trying to round up the prisoners and he kind of

2262
02:20:17.831 --> 02:20:21.670
jumps over with a couple of the guys into a little ditch and they cover up with

2263
02:20:21.671 --> 02:20:26.410
some branches
and they start talking to these three guys,

2264
02:20:26.411 --> 02:20:30.040
start saying,
look what you know.
Can we make a move?
Well,
let's,
you know,

2265
02:20:30.041 --> 02:20:34.660
let's head south and then finally one of the guys says,

2266
02:20:34.750 --> 02:20:39.160
that would be suicide in our condition.
We won't make it over those mountains.

2267
02:20:39.520 --> 02:20:43.540
We don't have warm clothes and we will probably die of hypothermia.

2268
02:20:43.810 --> 02:20:44.890
We knew he was right.

2269
02:20:47.470 --> 02:20:49.660
It was smarter to wait until springtime.

2270
02:20:49.870 --> 02:20:54.370
We needed to try and survive and hope our forces liberated us.

2271
02:20:58.790 --> 02:21:01.820
Now they're starting to get into like all the little bit of a routine.

2272
02:21:01.821 --> 02:21:05.240
My goal is to bring back discipline and start acting like soldiers again.

2273
02:21:05.360 --> 02:21:05.751
The scene,

2274
02:21:05.751 --> 02:21:09.140
the first night with the rice dropped on the ground was burned into my brain.

2275
02:21:09.260 --> 02:21:14.030
The only way we could survive until spring was an a possible escape attempt was

2276
02:21:14.031 --> 02:21:15.560
to start working together.

2277
02:21:19.390 --> 02:21:22.810
The sick and wounded suffered the most are frostbitten feet.

2278
02:21:22.811 --> 02:21:27.250
It turned to trench foot and open wounds were infected or gang green and said
in,

2279
02:21:27.251 --> 02:21:31.000
for those guys,
it was only a matter of time before they died,

2280
02:21:31.001 --> 02:21:34.090
since we had no medicine to treat them,

2281
02:21:37.290 --> 02:21:41.670
and finally from his little group,
he loses a guy whose last name is graves.

2282
02:21:41.850 --> 02:21:43.500
Graves was the first to die.

2283
02:21:44.610 --> 02:21:47.610
The valley had turned into one of death and suffering.

2284
02:21:48.510 --> 02:21:50.220
Soon after graves death,

2285
02:21:50.760 --> 02:21:55.350
chaplain coupon came to the house.
We were all surprised to see him.

2286
02:21:55.800 --> 02:21:58.410
I had last seen him at [inaudible],
but when he walked in,

2287
02:21:58.411 --> 02:21:59.790
I barely recognized him.

2288
02:22:00.810 --> 02:22:03.990
The man I'd met on a region Pusan was gone.

2289
02:22:04.200 --> 02:22:07.170
He'd lost a lot of weight and his uniform kind of hung on.

2290
02:22:07.171 --> 02:22:10.950
His frame is tired and worn out eyes.

2291
02:22:11.100 --> 02:22:12.750
Belied his warm smile

2292
02:22:14.410 --> 02:22:17.740
coupon told us who was dead or wounded before he left.

2293
02:22:17.800 --> 02:22:21.790
He told us to get organized.
We'll need to take action when the troops show up.

2294
02:22:21.791 --> 02:22:24.760
He said,
have a plan.
When the troops get close,

2295
02:22:24.880 --> 02:22:27.570
the North Koreans might try to kill us all

2296
02:22:34.300 --> 02:22:38.080
upon.
Never came back to my house,
but he continued to visit troops in the valley.

2297
02:22:38.740 --> 02:22:42.700
I know he prayed for each one of us when he could brought food to the starving

2298
02:22:42.940 --> 02:22:47.020
until he became so weak that the guards took him to the hospital.

2299
02:22:48.550 --> 02:22:50.890
Then we're going to hear about what that hospital consisted of.

2300
02:22:51.100 --> 02:22:56.100
He died of pneumonia in May of 1951 it was buried in a mass grave by the Yalu

2301
02:22:56.230 --> 02:22:57.063
River.

2302
02:22:59.530 --> 02:23:00.363
<v 1>Okay,</v>

2303
02:23:00.870 --> 02:23:03.990
<v 0>and if you don't know the story about chaplain coupon,</v>

2304
02:23:03.991 --> 02:23:08.991
he was awarded the Medal of honor for his actions in the Korean War.

2305
02:23:10.740 --> 02:23:14.310
And I'm sure we'll cover that in more detail at some point on this podcast,

2306
02:23:14.311 --> 02:23:19.311
but in the meantime you can look it up and read about a hero of war and a hero

2307
02:23:20.791 --> 02:23:24.560
of faith.
At one point,

2308
02:23:25.790 --> 02:23:28.460
Richardson tries to steal some Kimchi,
and again,

2309
02:23:28.490 --> 02:23:30.860
now I'm fast forwarding a bit to where

2310
02:23:33.080 --> 02:23:37.310
to where they're a little bit more settled in and he,

2311
02:23:37.500 --> 02:23:41.410
he steals like a bowl of Kimchi and they started,

2312
02:23:41.420 --> 02:23:44.800
the guards go all nuts and they're trying to find out who took the Kimchi,

2313
02:23:44.810 --> 02:23:47.410
who took the Kimchi and they,

2314
02:23:47.411 --> 02:23:50.690
they threatened them with a no one's going to be able to eat until we know who

2315
02:23:50.691 --> 02:23:55.310
took the Kimchi.
And finally he breaks down and says,
I did it.

2316
02:23:56.240 --> 02:24:01.040
Only me.
Now was the officer's turn to shake his head.

2317
02:24:01.400 --> 02:24:05.900
You lie more,
do it.
No,
only me and the guards.

2318
02:24:05.901 --> 02:24:06.734
I said,

2319
02:24:08.220 --> 02:24:11.870
the little son of a bitch looked at me and then nodded to the guards who grabbed

2320
02:24:11.871 --> 02:24:14.120
me and tied my arms behind my back.

2321
02:24:17.280 --> 02:24:18.210
You learn lesson.

2322
02:24:18.240 --> 02:24:23.240
Now the officer said the guards threw a rope over an open trust and pulled me up

2323
02:24:25.271 --> 02:24:28.600
by my arms until my feet barely touch the dirt floor.

2324
02:24:30.470 --> 02:24:31.970
The pain was excruciating.

2325
02:24:32.960 --> 02:24:37.880
I could feel lightening jolts of pain in my left arm and shoulder where I still

2326
02:24:37.881 --> 02:24:38.960
had shrapnel wounds.

2327
02:24:39.050 --> 02:24:43.100
The pain quickly crept up my arms driving straight to the top of my head.

2328
02:24:43.130 --> 02:24:44.600
I gasp for air.

2329
02:24:44.840 --> 02:24:49.760
The pressure on my chest allowed me to take only sharp short breaths.

2330
02:24:51.410 --> 02:24:56.410
I could hear myself moaning and once I cried out in pain before I passed out,

2331
02:25:00.710 --> 02:25:02.060
I woke up on the dirt floor.

2332
02:25:02.061 --> 02:25:05.090
I could barely feel the guards pulling the ropes off my arms.

2333
02:25:06.080 --> 02:25:09.320
I could hear the son of a bitch rattle off a few a few orders.

2334
02:25:09.530 --> 02:25:13.130
He sounded far away,
but I could see his boots and knew he was standing over me.

2335
02:25:14.090 --> 02:25:16.910
The guards dragged me to my feet throwing open the door.

2336
02:25:16.911 --> 02:25:19.370
They tossed me on the floor of my room.

2337
02:25:19.490 --> 02:25:24.070
I could barely move my legs and arms and stayed where I landed rest of the
night.

2338
02:25:25.030 --> 02:25:30.030
Martin helped me get comfortable and told me that the house had been fed earlier

2339
02:25:30.130 --> 02:25:34.070
that night.
He had no idea how long I'd been strung up.

2340
02:25:35.730 --> 02:25:38.940
The next morning I sat up and started making jokes.

2341
02:25:39.810 --> 02:25:44.790
Some of them laughed with me.
Others were just scared,
laughing,
hurt my ribs.

2342
02:25:44.880 --> 02:25:47.280
But it was the first time I've done it.
Since you saw him,

2343
02:25:48.600 --> 02:25:52.050
I was determined to keep my sense of humor.
I was tied.

2344
02:25:52.290 --> 02:25:54.900
It was tied to my will to live.

2345
02:25:56.510 --> 02:25:57.220
<v 1>Okay.</v>

2346
02:25:57.220 --> 02:26:00.430
<v 0>From that point on,
I remember to laugh whenever I could.</v>

2347
02:26:02.080 --> 02:26:05.050
Well,
I guess we won't be having Kim.
She anymore

2348
02:26:10.300 --> 02:26:11.800
after two months in the valley of the guards,

2349
02:26:11.820 --> 02:26:16.820
marches out of the valley and backup to the road in Pew tone.

2350
02:26:19.370 --> 02:26:21.890
So they're in a different location now

2351
02:26:23.450 --> 02:26:27.290
and in this location the Chinese have finally full,

2352
02:26:27.350 --> 02:26:32.350
fully take over the operation of the camp as opposed to the Koreans,

2353
02:26:32.661 --> 02:26:34.940
the North Koreans.
So now the,

2354
02:26:34.970 --> 02:26:38.510
it seems like the Chinese were a little bit nicer to the prisoners.

2355
02:26:39.140 --> 02:26:42.800
The Chinese issued each of us a small drinking cup along with a bowl for our

2356
02:26:42.801 --> 02:26:47.090
millet or our maze.
No more eating out of a helmet liner.

2357
02:26:47.570 --> 02:26:50.210
We were also allowed to start a Cooke house for each company.

2358
02:26:50.220 --> 02:26:52.310
We were occasionally given soybeans.

2359
02:26:54.650 --> 02:26:59.650
The wells were contaminated from animal and human feces seeping through the

2360
02:26:59.781 --> 02:27:03.230
ground and into the water.
Well,
so we didn't have fresh water.

2361
02:27:05.340 --> 02:27:07.830
There were about 3000 men in the camp.

2362
02:27:07.831 --> 02:27:12.150
Conditions were about as bad as a human being could possibly live with.
So again,

2363
02:27:12.180 --> 02:27:15.030
I pointed out that the Chinese were a little bit nicer because they gave him

2364
02:27:15.031 --> 02:27:18.210
like a bowl,
but it's,
don't get me wrong.

2365
02:27:19.170 --> 02:27:22.710
This was about as close as you could get to Andersonville and the civil war,

2366
02:27:22.920 --> 02:27:25.690
which that was a,
uh,

2367
02:27:25.870 --> 02:27:30.060
a confederate prisoner of war camp for union soldiers.

2368
02:27:31.320 --> 02:27:36.180
And there was about 45,000 soldiers that were captured in,

2369
02:27:36.181 --> 02:27:37.150
that were in that prison camp.

2370
02:27:37.151 --> 02:27:40.830
We're about 13,000 of them died from scurvy and from,

2371
02:27:41.070 --> 02:27:44.520
from diarrhea and dysentery.

2372
02:27:45.960 --> 02:27:50.460
So,
you know,
it's funny,
we think of like diarrhea,
first of all,

2373
02:27:50.461 --> 02:27:53.460
we think of as like a joke and then we think of it as like an inconvenience.

2374
02:27:53.670 --> 02:27:56.190
But when you're in these situations,
it kills you.

2375
02:27:56.470 --> 02:27:57.303
<v 1>Hmm.</v>

2376
02:27:58.510 --> 02:28:02.280
<v 0>Back to the book.
We were full of lice.
The farm boys told us we were hot.</v>

2377
02:28:02.680 --> 02:28:05.800
They were hog lice growing larger every day on our blood.

2378
02:28:06.430 --> 02:28:08.800
While the lice got fat,
we starved.

2379
02:28:10.000 --> 02:28:15.000
The guards brought us two bowls of millet a day and one bowl of boiled water,

2380
02:28:16.090 --> 02:28:20.670
which barely kept us alive.
And even when we ate disinterested,

2381
02:28:20.680 --> 02:28:25.130
kept weak and dehydrated hunger can do some strange,

2382
02:28:25.420 --> 02:28:29.810
strange things to your mind.
I was at the latrine,

2383
02:28:30.260 --> 02:28:35.240
a slit trench,
and I noticed that many of the soy beans,
we're past hole.

2384
02:28:36.530 --> 02:28:41.390
I thought if I picked them out of the feces and wash them off,

2385
02:28:41.990 --> 02:28:42.823
I could eat them.

2386
02:28:43.770 --> 02:28:44.370
<v 1>Okay.</v>

2387
02:28:44.370 --> 02:28:47.940
<v 0>Then it dawned on me that I must be going crazy or turning it into an animal.</v>

2388
02:28:48.180 --> 02:28:51.570
It would be a few days before I was able to get over the fact that I had let

2389
02:28:51.571 --> 02:28:55.290
myself sink to a disgusting fought like that.

2390
02:29:02.700 --> 02:29:06.240
So
next time you feeling hungry,

2391
02:29:06.270 --> 02:29:09.510
you're not feeling hungry.
You even know what that feels like.

2392
02:29:13.820 --> 02:29:14.490
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

2393
02:29:14.490 --> 02:29:19.290
<v 0>They ended up,
uh,
like forming a little group.</v>

2394
02:29:19.291 --> 02:29:20.220
And you just mentioned this,

2395
02:29:20.221 --> 02:29:25.110
this one guy in this group named Vincent Doyle Doyle became the leader of this

2396
02:29:25.111 --> 02:29:28.470
little group and infantry men during World War II.

2397
02:29:29.950 --> 02:29:32.820
You had a wife and a son in fall river,
river,
Massachusetts.

2398
02:29:32.821 --> 02:29:36.240
He received a battlefield commission in France and left the army as a
lieutenant.

2399
02:29:36.450 --> 02:29:40.860
He opened up a frozen food store in fall river.
A little ahead of its time.

2400
02:29:40.861 --> 02:29:42.390
Not many families had freezers.

2401
02:29:42.600 --> 02:29:46.860
He went out of business and reenlisted as a master sergeant,
not an officer.

2402
02:29:47.370 --> 02:29:51.750
He was an inch too short to be an officer of the army.
Told him.
Yeah.

2403
02:29:51.780 --> 02:29:53.460
That's one of the reasons why I left that in.

2404
02:29:53.461 --> 02:29:55.440
There was like the guys just humble like,
oh,

2405
02:29:55.441 --> 02:29:56.640
I can't cut it as an officer anymore.

2406
02:29:56.730 --> 02:30:00.990
Even though I got a battlefield commission in World War Two.
Oh,
that's okay.

2407
02:30:00.991 --> 02:30:04.170
I'll just,
I'll just enlist.
That's no for no factor.
That's,

2408
02:30:04.171 --> 02:30:09.150
that's like the humility.
I don't know if you see that kind of humility anymore.

2409
02:30:10.230 --> 02:30:13.380
Normally I don't make a big deal out of the generational differences,

2410
02:30:13.381 --> 02:30:15.630
but that's a pretty humble guy right there.

2411
02:30:17.570 --> 02:30:18.403
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

2412
02:30:19.200 --> 02:30:19.831
<v 0>Back to the book.</v>

2413
02:30:19.831 --> 02:30:23.700
Our biggest problem was our physical condition brought on by the march men with

2414
02:30:23.701 --> 02:30:27.720
open wounds.
Many with gang green didn't survive long.

2415
02:30:27.900 --> 02:30:32.400
Some were saved from gangrene by maggots eating their dead flesh,

2416
02:30:32.610 --> 02:30:35.490
which only meant they suffered longer.
I mean,

2417
02:30:35.491 --> 02:30:38.730
we've been through that before with a forgotten island or who they would

2418
02:30:39.030 --> 02:30:43.680
actually put magnets to get rid of dead flesh to try and save themselves.

2419
02:30:45.150 --> 02:30:48.240
Some of the soldiers had black feet from frostbite and trench foot.

2420
02:30:48.241 --> 02:30:52.350
I watched while one man pulled rotted flesh off his toe bones.

2421
02:30:53.240 --> 02:30:53.810
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

2422
02:30:53.810 --> 02:30:57.590
<v 0>The soldiers from the Second Infantry Division had it worst they'd been issued</v>

2423
02:30:57.620 --> 02:31:01.700
shoe packs,
rubber boots with felt liners and insoles.

2424
02:31:02.300 --> 02:31:06.440
Their feet would sweat and they were continuously wet while marching and they

2425
02:31:06.441 --> 02:31:08.150
would freeze when they stopped marching.

2426
02:31:08.300 --> 02:31:12.440
Since they never took off the shoe packs,
the soldiers got trench foot.

2427
02:31:13.700 --> 02:31:17.170
It's easily understood when men die of wounds or pneumonia.

2428
02:31:17.410 --> 02:31:21.120
It is more difficult to understand when men just lie down and quit.

2429
02:31:22.280 --> 02:31:22.870
<v 1>Okay.</v>

2430
02:31:22.870 --> 02:31:25.540
<v 0>I've seen strong men seemingly just give up and die.</v>

2431
02:31:25.750 --> 02:31:29.260
First they would stop eating and stare with blank eyes at the mud walls of the

2432
02:31:29.261 --> 02:31:30.094
hut.

2433
02:31:30.920 --> 02:31:31.540
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

2434
02:31:31.540 --> 02:31:34.720
<v 0>Their minds were gone and life just slipped away.</v>

2435
02:31:36.180 --> 02:31:36.920
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

2436
02:31:36.920 --> 02:31:41.780
<v 0>Then after a few days,
you are at an all too familiar death rattle.</v>

2437
02:31:44.500 --> 02:31:47.530
We were dying at a rate of about 30 a day.

2438
02:31:47.770 --> 02:31:49.600
Each morning we took out the dead,

2439
02:31:49.870 --> 02:31:53.110
stripped them of their clothes and stack them like cordwood in a pile.

2440
02:31:53.230 --> 02:31:56.200
At first we tried to take the uniforms and coats and give them to other

2441
02:31:56.201 --> 02:31:58.360
prisoners,
but the Chinese guards wouldn't allow it.

2442
02:32:00.240 --> 02:32:02.640
What they did with the uniforms is still a mystery.

2443
02:32:04.150 --> 02:32:04.850
<v 1>Okay.</v>

2444
02:32:04.850 --> 02:32:09.530
<v 0>I hated being part of the burial detail.
The physical part was bad enough,</v>

2445
02:32:09.531 --> 02:32:11.270
but the mental part was much worse.

2446
02:32:11.510 --> 02:32:15.290
Thoughts about the families of the dead men and if they left children behind who

2447
02:32:15.291 --> 02:32:17.360
might never know what happened to them.

2448
02:32:19.030 --> 02:32:22.420
I knew from listening to men talk that what bothered most of them was the

2449
02:32:22.421 --> 02:32:24.010
thought that they might be next.

2450
02:32:24.460 --> 02:32:27.080
That's one thing I never let my mind to think about.

2451
02:32:36.290 --> 02:32:37.123
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

2452
02:32:38.110 --> 02:32:38.621
<v 0>And again,</v>

2453
02:32:38.621 --> 02:32:43.621
he moves around a bit to various places and various camps and gets various jobs.

2454
02:32:43.811 --> 02:32:47.680
And again,
you have to read this book to really comprehend this.

2455
02:32:48.080 --> 02:32:53.080
The level of suffering that was endured by these prisoners back to the book in

2456
02:32:53.171 --> 02:32:53.981
early spring,

2457
02:32:53.981 --> 02:32:58.330
1951 the Chinese were building small docs on the river and I was unlucky enough

2458
02:32:58.331 --> 02:33:00.340
to be put to work on the crew.

2459
02:33:00.910 --> 02:33:03.670
A group of us were carrying one of these timbers up a hill.

2460
02:33:03.820 --> 02:33:05.830
When someone in the center stumbled,
stumbled,

2461
02:33:05.860 --> 02:33:08.710
and the timber fell pinning me to the ground.

2462
02:33:09.940 --> 02:33:10.580
<v 1>Okay.</v>

2463
02:33:10.580 --> 02:33:13.670
<v 0>And when that happens is back,</v>

2464
02:33:13.671 --> 02:33:15.920
gets jammed up and,

2465
02:33:17.300 --> 02:33:18.950
and even though he makes it through that day,

2466
02:33:18.951 --> 02:33:21.740
it starts getting worse and worse throughout the day.
Now,

2467
02:33:22.670 --> 02:33:23.503
<v 1>okay,</v>

2468
02:33:23.900 --> 02:33:27.350
<v 0>there's a hospital,
right?
It's a hospital,</v>

2469
02:33:27.351 --> 02:33:29.060
but they actually called this the hospital.

2470
02:33:29.061 --> 02:33:31.310
It's just like every other prisoner camp that we've heard about.

2471
02:33:31.311 --> 02:33:34.760
When you go to the hospital,
you're dead.
That's just a place they put you a diet.

2472
02:33:34.761 --> 02:33:35.810
It's the same thing here.

2473
02:33:35.990 --> 02:33:39.510
So his guys are trying to prevent him from being taken to the hall,

2474
02:33:39.620 --> 02:33:40.730
to the hospital.

2475
02:33:41.330 --> 02:33:45.380
So they're carrying him back and forth to their formations and finally the

2476
02:33:45.381 --> 02:33:47.120
Chinese realize that he can't walk.

2477
02:33:48.380 --> 02:33:53.000
So the Chinese come to the door and back to the book,

2478
02:33:53.001 --> 02:33:55.310
they were taking me to the hospital.
We called it the morgue.

2479
02:33:55.340 --> 02:33:59.030
We had never seen anyone return from there.
I wanted to fight back,

2480
02:33:59.031 --> 02:33:59.864
but I couldn't.

2481
02:34:00.140 --> 02:34:04.490
The guards close the door to one of the rooms in the cluster of houses that

2482
02:34:04.491 --> 02:34:08.360
served as the hospital and threw me in.
It was dark and I could not see anyone.

2483
02:34:08.570 --> 02:34:12.110
I landed on top of a wounded and sick lying on the dirt floor.

2484
02:34:12.260 --> 02:34:14.780
They immediately started kicking in,
cursing me.

2485
02:34:14.990 --> 02:34:18.490
The stench from the wounds and the human feces was unimaginable.

2486
02:34:18.700 --> 02:34:23.330
I started to gag.
So this is,
I mean,
this is just the,

2487
02:34:23.820 --> 02:34:24.370
I don't even,

2488
02:34:24.370 --> 02:34:27.400
I can't even imagine anything is going to be worse than the situation he's in

2489
02:34:27.401 --> 02:34:28.160
now.

2490
02:34:28.160 --> 02:34:32.980
These put in this giant room filled with shit and wounded people that are going

2491
02:34:32.981 --> 02:34:37.270
to die,
and by the way,
it's like they've got dysentery and they've got diarrhea.

2492
02:34:37.271 --> 02:34:42.271
So it's just a total nightmare and he's trying to maintain a little bit of

2493
02:34:42.911 --> 02:34:46.540
dignity and he asks one of the guys in the room,
where's the,

2494
02:34:46.840 --> 02:34:47.980
where's the latrine?

2495
02:34:49.030 --> 02:34:54.030
He had to use the restroom and the guy tells him out the door,

2496
02:34:54.251 --> 02:34:57.730
go left to the end of the building,
left again in 25 yards on a no,

2497
02:34:57.731 --> 02:35:01.540
you'll find the latrine.
The temperature was freezing,

2498
02:35:01.541 --> 02:35:02.650
but I welcome the fresh air.

2499
02:35:02.651 --> 02:35:06.550
I dragged myself out on my buttocks pushing myself along with my hands.

2500
02:35:06.760 --> 02:35:11.320
I reached the latrine,
a trench,
a foot and a half wide and 10 feet long.

2501
02:35:12.370 --> 02:35:14.500
The trench sat just outside.

2502
02:35:14.501 --> 02:35:18.310
A strand of wire that separated our camp from the black prisoners.

2503
02:35:19.390 --> 02:35:23.980
The human waste was like putting an,
almost reached to the top of the trench.

2504
02:35:24.130 --> 02:35:29.130
I managed to get my pants down and had worked my way to the edge when the side

2505
02:35:29.621 --> 02:35:30.454
caved in.

2506
02:35:31.250 --> 02:35:31.780
<v 2>Okay?</v>

2507
02:35:31.780 --> 02:35:35.050
<v 0>I fell into the trench,
finally catching my shoulders on the edge.</v>

2508
02:35:35.290 --> 02:35:39.430
The waste was at my chin.
As I clawed at the dirt,
trying to pull myself free,

2509
02:35:39.640 --> 02:35:44.110
my legs paralyzed like an anchor,
pulled me toward the bottom.

2510
02:35:45.860 --> 02:35:47.990
I yelled out and kept crawling,
climbing,

2511
02:35:48.170 --> 02:35:53.170
but every second I slipped deeper and deeper into the trench to black prisoners

2512
02:35:54.201 --> 02:35:57.650
on the other side.
Heard me.
They crawled through the barbed wire,

2513
02:35:57.770 --> 02:36:02.210
grabbed me by my arms and pulled me out a second later and I would have slipped

2514
02:36:02.211 --> 02:36:03.200
under the surface.

2515
02:36:04.370 --> 02:36:05.050
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

2516
02:36:05.050 --> 02:36:07.480
<v 0>the guards heard all the commotion and we're closing in.</v>

2517
02:36:07.660 --> 02:36:11.830
My saviors scrambled back through the fence.
Just as the guards arrived.

2518
02:36:11.980 --> 02:36:12.671
To this day,

2519
02:36:12.671 --> 02:36:17.320
I have no idea who saved me fearing I was trying to escape.

2520
02:36:17.500 --> 02:36:19.750
They started to beat me with the rifle butts.

2521
02:36:19.930 --> 02:36:22.480
I covered my head to try and protect myself.

2522
02:36:22.690 --> 02:36:27.490
As I lay there covered in shit.
I lost control of my bowels.

2523
02:36:31.270 --> 02:36:32.103
That was it.

2524
02:36:33.830 --> 02:36:34.020
<v 2>Okay.</v>

2525
02:36:34.020 --> 02:36:34.853
<v 0>I was done,</v>

2526
02:36:38.780 --> 02:36:40.490
but giving up meant def.

2527
02:36:41.570 --> 02:36:42.060
<v 2>Okay.</v>

2528
02:36:42.060 --> 02:36:44.820
<v 0>I had lived with death every day since coming to Korea.</v>

2529
02:36:45.000 --> 02:36:47.610
The battlefield was like a movie.
In fast forward,

2530
02:36:47.760 --> 02:36:50.850
there was so much going on and I couldn't dwell on death.

2531
02:36:50.851 --> 02:36:52.860
Very long call for the medic,

2532
02:36:52.980 --> 02:36:56.010
possibly hold the wounded man in my arms or say a word or two.

2533
02:36:56.011 --> 02:36:58.320
As he passed from life to death,

2534
02:37:00.640 --> 02:37:01.930
it was different.
As a prisoner.

2535
02:37:03.470 --> 02:37:08.150
I had no way of defending myself other than using my mind and what physical

2536
02:37:08.151 --> 02:37:09.950
capabilities I could muster.

2537
02:37:13.320 --> 02:37:16.970
I realized my mind had to be my strength

2538
02:37:20.440 --> 02:37:21.940
for a split second,

2539
02:37:23.620 --> 02:37:27.610
all of the pain and suffering could have ended.

2540
02:37:30.900 --> 02:37:35.340
No.
My mind screamed.
I could not give up.

2541
02:37:35.550 --> 02:37:40.500
I'd come this far and in that second I set my mind to doing something no one had

2542
02:37:40.501 --> 02:37:44.710
done.
I was going to come back from the morgue.

2543
02:37:46.470 --> 02:37:50.670
As the Chinese soldiers landed blow after blow on my back and legs.

2544
02:37:51.330 --> 02:37:55.920
I banished death from my mind.
Never again

2545
02:37:57.420 --> 02:37:58.740
did it enter into it.

2546
02:38:07.140 --> 02:38:11.880
Many lost control of their minds and did things they would never have done under

2547
02:38:11.881 --> 02:38:15.060
normal circumstances.
I didn't know what to say.

2548
02:38:16.260 --> 02:38:19.950
When I heard stories or saw things were men were mistreating one another.

2549
02:38:20.820 --> 02:38:24.030
I thought of the first night of captivity when the Chinese dumped the rice on

2550
02:38:24.031 --> 02:38:27.120
the ground.
What happens to men when they become prisoners?

2551
02:38:27.300 --> 02:38:32.300
Why did they change from helping one another and becoming and become totally

2552
02:38:32.911 --> 02:38:37.290
engrossed in themselves with totally selfish outlook on life?

2553
02:38:37.970 --> 02:38:40.170
I understand.
I'm not talking about all men,

2554
02:38:41.610 --> 02:38:44.160
but many never come to grips with losing their freedom.

2555
02:38:45.240 --> 02:38:48.590
They feel abandoned by their country and are no longer longer with men.

2556
02:38:48.591 --> 02:38:50.220
They trust in their minds,

2557
02:38:50.340 --> 02:38:54.540
their personal survival becomes paramount and group survival no longer matters.

2558
02:38:56.970 --> 02:39:00.480
So again,
I mean going back to that part at the latrine,

2559
02:39:02.640 --> 02:39:03.330
that's a little,

2560
02:39:03.330 --> 02:39:06.870
that's a little footnote you can put in your brain for the rest of your life

2561
02:39:07.260 --> 02:39:10.680
because we're all going to have bad situations.
I get it.
I mean,

2562
02:39:10.681 --> 02:39:12.540
there's going to be horrible things that are going to happen.

2563
02:39:13.320 --> 02:39:16.230
I don't know if there's much,

2564
02:39:16.350 --> 02:39:19.440
I don't know if it can get much worse than the situation that he was in right

2565
02:39:19.441 --> 02:39:23.730
there.
And,
and realizing

2566
02:39:25.230 --> 02:39:29.370
that his mind was his strength,
realizing that,

2567
02:39:30.420 --> 02:39:30.840
<v 1>okay,</v>

2568
02:39:30.840 --> 02:39:32.460
<v 0>he had no other way to defend,</v>

2569
02:39:32.490 --> 02:39:37.490
but he's mind had to be strong and he had that little split second thought that

2570
02:39:40.351 --> 02:39:45.210
he could give up and just let it all go.
Just let it all go.

2571
02:39:45.660 --> 02:39:47.670
Let that pain and suffering stop.

2572
02:39:50.000 --> 02:39:50.833
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

2573
02:39:51.240 --> 02:39:55.830
<v 0>But then he realized,
no,
not going to do that.</v>

2574
02:39:57.730 --> 02:40:00.160
Not going to surrender.
Not Happening.

2575
02:40:03.160 --> 02:40:06.840
<v 1>Okay.
Okay.</v>

2576
02:40:08.570 --> 02:40:09.403
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

2577
02:40:13.290 --> 02:40:15.510
So eventually,

2578
02:40:15.780 --> 02:40:20.780
I mean he goes through more hell and eventually gets on two crutches and then

2579
02:40:21.001 --> 02:40:23.040
one crutch and eventually he makes it,

2580
02:40:23.250 --> 02:40:28.020
he makes it out of the morgue and he gets sent back with the rest of the rest of

2581
02:40:28.021 --> 02:40:29.220
the team.
And when he gets back,

2582
02:40:29.240 --> 02:40:31.590
they're like completely amazed that this is a guy that they,

2583
02:40:31.710 --> 02:40:34.500
they probably mourn his death cause they thought when you go to the morgue,

2584
02:40:34.501 --> 02:40:39.270
you're dead.
And when he gets back,
he's with Doyle and smoke.
These are his boys,

2585
02:40:39.360 --> 02:40:44.190
Doyle and smoke.
S.
M.
O a.
K.
Welcome back.
Doyle said,

2586
02:40:45.150 --> 02:40:47.400
says no one had ever come back from the morgue.

2587
02:40:47.580 --> 02:40:52.230
The guy's peppered me with questions about his treatment,
what treatment?
I said,

2588
02:40:52.980 --> 02:40:57.690
and they all laughed.
I told them we never received any medicine,
God,
less food.

2589
02:40:57.691 --> 02:40:59.520
And the room smelled like a cesspool.

2590
02:41:00.570 --> 02:41:05.570
I told them how I'd almost drown in the trench and that two guys from the black

2591
02:41:05.701 --> 02:41:07.590
compound saved my life.

2592
02:41:09.860 --> 02:41:14.720
It was a shitty situation.
I said,
and again,
they all laughed.

2593
02:41:15.080 --> 02:41:18.560
So this guy does a great job of trying to keep,
keep track of that humor

2594
02:41:22.040 --> 02:41:23.510
continuing since I'd been in the morgue,

2595
02:41:23.511 --> 02:41:25.850
the Chinese had started putting a lot of pressure on us.

2596
02:41:26.210 --> 02:41:30.080
We were required to spend hours in lectures and discussion groups supervised by

2597
02:41:30.081 --> 02:41:33.650
Chinese political officers.
This is when their indoctrination has taken place.

2598
02:41:34.010 --> 02:41:36.830
Doyle explained that the political officers began by breaking you down

2599
02:41:36.831 --> 02:41:37.281
physically,

2600
02:41:37.281 --> 02:41:40.460
so you started to agree with them and then just just to get them off your back

2601
02:41:40.670 --> 02:41:41.540
when this happened,

2602
02:41:41.750 --> 02:41:45.320
they would be on you full first portion you to make a statement against the

2603
02:41:45.321 --> 02:41:48.200
United States government or to make a statement as to the next wonderful

2604
02:41:48.201 --> 02:41:50.720
treatment that you're receiving.
Next,

2605
02:41:50.721 --> 02:41:54.140
you'd be one of the turncoats standing up on stage giving a lecture,

2606
02:41:56.630 --> 02:41:58.790
so they're going through this.
Even though they're getting,

2607
02:41:58.791 --> 02:42:00.980
trying to get propaganda statements out of them,

2608
02:42:01.010 --> 02:42:04.730
they're still getting treated horribly.
We were still dying in great numbers.

2609
02:42:05.060 --> 02:42:08.420
It had just been removed from our site.
They also tried to improve our diet.

2610
02:42:08.600 --> 02:42:12.290
Prisoners even started to make steam bred by taking balls of Dylan,

2611
02:42:12.291 --> 02:42:15.290
placing them on a bamboo rack.
Over a pot of steaming water.

2612
02:42:17.670 --> 02:42:21.660
And one of the,
one of the leaders I just had to note this one,
uh,

2613
02:42:21.661 --> 02:42:26.160
one of the interrogation propaganda communist leader said,

2614
02:42:26.430 --> 02:42:30.210
I will leave a hundred men to die to save one progressive

2615
02:42:33.200 --> 02:42:37.190
meaning communist
and they spoke English.

2616
02:42:37.191 --> 02:42:41.030
Those are the words that they used a Chinese interrogators propaganda.

2617
02:42:41.031 --> 02:42:45.050
People spoke English and he says,

2618
02:42:45.051 --> 02:42:49.220
we outwardly challenged the loss of individual freedom under their system.

2619
02:42:49.221 --> 02:42:51.860
The Chinese became quite agitated

2620
02:42:53.570 --> 02:42:56.540
and I liked this part.
So there again,
I mean,

2621
02:42:56.550 --> 02:43:00.140
I don't want to say that they're getting the treatments good by any stretch,

2622
02:43:00.141 --> 02:43:01.910
but it's at least a little bit better.

2623
02:43:02.210 --> 02:43:05.390
And it's part of it is them trying to convince them to,
you know,
be communists.

2624
02:43:05.391 --> 02:43:09.770
They can make statements against American,
do that whole thing.
So they,

2625
02:43:09.860 --> 02:43:11.770
here's the,
here's this one part.

2626
02:43:11.771 --> 02:43:15.550
Despite working many hours building the long houses,

2627
02:43:15.700 --> 02:43:18.890
we were still required to attend lectures.
And one,

2628
02:43:19.230 --> 02:43:21.550
a Chinese acting troupe came to town.

2629
02:43:22.030 --> 02:43:25.660
It was their version of a USO show called the white haired girl.

2630
02:43:25.780 --> 02:43:26.830
The storyline was simple.

2631
02:43:28.210 --> 02:43:32.590
A peasant family could not pay the taxes demanded by the dastardly landowner.

2632
02:43:32.740 --> 02:43:37.390
So he takes the peasants,
beautiful young black hair daughter as his concubine.

2633
02:43:38.170 --> 02:43:41.350
She suffers terribly under his demented date demands,

2634
02:43:41.560 --> 02:43:45.340
but eventually escapes to the mountains.
Years later,

2635
02:43:45.341 --> 02:43:48.670
as the People's Liberation Liberation Army frees the people,

2636
02:43:49.270 --> 02:43:54.100
the girl returns to the village,
but now her hair has turned completely white.

2637
02:43:55.000 --> 02:43:59.410
The play was well done and the Chinese officers and soldiers hung on every word.

2638
02:43:59.590 --> 02:44:01.690
They saw the girl story as their own.

2639
02:44:02.830 --> 02:44:05.560
They clapped when the People's Liberation Army arrived.

2640
02:44:05.740 --> 02:44:09.400
The play of course omitted the fact that Mao and killed thousands,

2641
02:44:09.401 --> 02:44:14.260
and I'll correct him there millions of people and his drive to take control of

2642
02:44:14.261 --> 02:44:18.100
China.
And this is why I read this part cause he says,

2643
02:44:18.280 --> 02:44:22.180
we laughed and cheered when the landlord drag the young girl away.

2644
02:44:23.050 --> 02:44:27.070
The Chinese guards were not amused and for days there was an awkward silence,

2645
02:44:29.810 --> 02:44:34.810
kind of got a kick out of that bunch of rambunctious prisoners of war ruining

2646
02:44:36.251 --> 02:44:40.940
your little play.
When it got warm enough,

2647
02:44:41.000 --> 02:44:43.820
the Chinese let us stay out of baseball field near the river.

2648
02:44:43.940 --> 02:44:46.730
We didn't have any balls or bats,
but we went through the motions.

2649
02:44:46.850 --> 02:44:50.810
We made teams and selected umpires.
We called balls and strikes.

2650
02:44:50.930 --> 02:44:53.030
It sounded weird,
but we had a lot of fun.

2651
02:44:53.180 --> 02:44:56.960
We spend hours out there and then he goes on to tell this story.

2652
02:44:56.961 --> 02:45:00.680
Late one afternoon I cry when I read that.
I was like,
that's kind of interesting.

2653
02:45:00.681 --> 02:45:02.510
I mean,
I could see where you'd do something to entertain yourself,

2654
02:45:02.511 --> 02:45:05.620
but they had a little bit of a bigger plan.
Late one afternoon alone,

2655
02:45:05.630 --> 02:45:08.210
American fighter jet came screaming down the river.

2656
02:45:08.750 --> 02:45:12.590
We were out on the ball field.
At first.
It scared the hell out of us.

2657
02:45:12.710 --> 02:45:16.010
It went by us in a flash,
but doubled back and flew straight down the river.

2658
02:45:16.340 --> 02:45:20.090
We could see the pilot looking down and as he passed the pilot waves and wiggled

2659
02:45:20.091 --> 02:45:24.440
his wings at us,
there were no words to describe how that incident made us feel.

2660
02:45:24.441 --> 02:45:27.080
God bless him.
He probably never knew.

2661
02:45:27.170 --> 02:45:29.450
That's what that simple act did for us.

2662
02:45:29.660 --> 02:45:33.980
It was very long time before we stopped talking about it and we'd achieved our

2663
02:45:33.981 --> 02:45:38.900
goal with the ball field.
The Chinese refuse to identify POW camps,

2664
02:45:39.110 --> 02:45:42.010
but the ball field did the trick,
uh,

2665
02:45:45.920 --> 02:45:50.230
soon after when winter set in,
so now they're going to another winter.
I got sick,

2666
02:45:50.270 --> 02:45:53.270
started running a high fever and was coughing up green and yellow mucus.

2667
02:45:53.271 --> 02:45:57.740
Doyle and smoke moved me near the stove and kept me hydrated with hot water.

2668
02:45:57.860 --> 02:45:59.540
A medic told me I had pneumonia.

2669
02:45:59.720 --> 02:46:03.350
I thought of graves and was grateful that I wasn't still in the morgue.

2670
02:46:04.670 --> 02:46:05.930
After a couple of days,
the fee,

2671
02:46:05.990 --> 02:46:08.990
the fever broke and I got better Doyle and smoke both.

2672
02:46:09.230 --> 02:46:12.680
They were sure I'd make it.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Rich.

2673
02:46:12.740 --> 02:46:15.980
Some of us thought we might need to dip you in the Shit House again to make you

2674
02:46:15.981 --> 02:46:17.210
better as what?
Smoked all the time.

2675
02:46:20.410 --> 02:46:21.160
<v 2>Okay.</v>

2676
02:46:21.160 --> 02:46:23.710
<v 0>In early spring,</v>

2677
02:46:23.770 --> 02:46:28.770
my legs were finally in shape to begin thinking about escape again too.

2678
02:46:30.040 --> 02:46:34.960
When I read that,
I just wrote the words long game next to her.
I mean,
Bro,

2679
02:46:35.020 --> 02:46:38.950
can you imagine you're three years deep in prison camp and the whole time you're

2680
02:46:38.951 --> 02:46:39.730
thinking,
well,

2681
02:46:39.730 --> 02:46:43.420
if I can just take the next year to get my legs healed up enough where I can

2682
02:46:43.421 --> 02:46:46.590
walk,
then I can try and escape again.
Even when he first got capture is like,

2683
02:46:46.591 --> 02:46:48.090
okay,
if I can just make the springtime,

2684
02:46:48.280 --> 02:46:51.760
we'll be a little bit stronger to let the weather to talk about playing the long

2685
02:46:51.761 --> 02:46:52.520
game.

2686
02:46:52.520 --> 02:46:53.353
<v 2>Yes.</v>

2687
02:46:56.790 --> 02:46:59.960
<v 0>They as they were planned in this escape,
uh,</v>

2688
02:47:00.910 --> 02:47:05.910
they were going to take Doyle and smoke and they were talking about it and soon

2689
02:47:07.901 --> 02:47:11.020
smoke was doubled over.
Doyle tried to get the Chinese to do something,

2690
02:47:11.021 --> 02:47:13.840
but they ignored us.
Please soon smoke couldn't talk.

2691
02:47:13.900 --> 02:47:18.690
He just laid in bed and Moan.
When it got really bad,
he screamed.

2692
02:47:18.691 --> 02:47:23.070
Finally he passed out.
His face was locked into torment,
tortured,
grimace,

2693
02:47:23.071 --> 02:47:25.920
and his skin turned ashen at noon.

2694
02:47:25.921 --> 02:47:28.920
The medic that was helping him turn to us and shook his head.

2695
02:47:29.790 --> 02:47:30.170
<v 2>Okay,</v>

2696
02:47:30.170 --> 02:47:31.003
<v 0>he's dead.</v>

2697
02:47:31.780 --> 02:47:32.370
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

2698
02:47:32.370 --> 02:47:35.040
<v 0>The words landed on us like mortar rounds.</v>

2699
02:47:35.041 --> 02:47:38.880
I just stood there staring at his face and shock dead.

2700
02:47:39.600 --> 02:47:42.660
How could this have happened in such a short time?
Only seven months ago,

2701
02:47:42.661 --> 02:47:45.840
men were dying all around us.
It was normal since we'd moved,

2702
02:47:45.841 --> 02:47:48.750
prisoners didn't die anymore.
We were the survivors.

2703
02:47:48.870 --> 02:47:51.690
This wasn't supposed to happen to anyone anymore.

2704
02:47:53.220 --> 02:47:53.780
<v 2>Okay.</v>

2705
02:47:53.780 --> 02:47:56.510
<v 0>The shock quickly boiled up into a rage.</v>

2706
02:47:58.400 --> 02:47:58.810
<v 2>Okay.</v>

2707
02:47:58.810 --> 02:48:01.060
<v 0>And these guys kind of,
you know,</v>

2708
02:48:01.061 --> 02:48:05.320
kind of yell at the Chinese and make a little,
they,

2709
02:48:05.580 --> 02:48:09.580
they kind of cause some,
some problems.
Um,
nothing too drastic,

2710
02:48:09.581 --> 02:48:13.210
but you know,
they weren't,
they weren't just cowering anymore.

2711
02:48:13.390 --> 02:48:14.223
<v 2>Hmm.</v>

2712
02:48:15.660 --> 02:48:16.121
<v 0>Back to book.</v>

2713
02:48:16.121 --> 02:48:20.100
The winter of 1952 to 53 was livable compared to the past two winters.

2714
02:48:20.280 --> 02:48:23.700
We were allowed to select our own leaders in organized committees to work on

2715
02:48:23.701 --> 02:48:27.690
different facets of our daily life.
Uh,
sanitation committee,
Athletic Committee.

2716
02:48:27.691 --> 02:48:31.920
A day we action committee all brought some semblance of order to our lives.

2717
02:48:32.490 --> 02:48:35.250
Food had improved too.
We got steamed bread,

2718
02:48:35.251 --> 02:48:38.700
vegetables and rice once in a while,
some fish and meat.

2719
02:48:39.600 --> 02:48:41.250
But it was usually just a scrap.

2720
02:48:42.120 --> 02:48:45.720
The change in Diet was enough to let us gain some weight.

2721
02:48:52.680 --> 02:48:55.440
July 27th,

2722
02:48:55.440 --> 02:48:59.640
1953 the Chinese had us all in a formation when they announced that a peace

2723
02:48:59.641 --> 02:49:04.380
agreement had been reached.
We stood silently looking at one another.

2724
02:49:05.460 --> 02:49:09.120
No one said anything.
This news had been a long time coming.

2725
02:49:10.690 --> 02:49:13.810
I just stood there,
a smile plastered across my face.

2726
02:49:13.960 --> 02:49:18.670
I looked down at my rail thin frame,
like a map.
It showed my journey,

2727
02:49:19.210 --> 02:49:22.300
scars on my back from shrapnel,
a missing tooth,

2728
02:49:23.050 --> 02:49:25.480
night blindness from lack of vitamins,

2729
02:49:25.930 --> 02:49:28.960
which luckily only lasted for a couple of weeks.

2730
02:49:29.810 --> 02:49:30.380
<v 2>Okay.</v>

2731
02:49:30.380 --> 02:49:31.910
<v 0>I was one of the fortunate ones.</v>

2732
02:49:33.100 --> 02:49:33.580
<v 2>Okay.</v>

2733
02:49:33.580 --> 02:49:38.270
<v 0>I'd survived
and that's it.
I mean,
that's like,</v>

2734
02:49:38.970 --> 02:49:41.870
like it just changes immediately now.
They still have to get out of there.

2735
02:49:42.080 --> 02:49:45.200
To this day,
when I think of our movement south,

2736
02:49:45.201 --> 02:49:47.270
I still get butterflies in my stomach.

2737
02:49:49.900 --> 02:49:50.460
<v 2>Okay.</v>

2738
02:49:50.460 --> 02:49:53.580
<v 0>They were moving us to the railhead at Ma'am Poe.</v>

2739
02:49:53.581 --> 02:49:57.450
The Chinese gave one of the prisoners a lock and told them to close the gates

2740
02:49:57.451 --> 02:50:00.660
after the trucks pulled out.
After we passed,

2741
02:50:01.000 --> 02:50:06.000
he snapped the lock shot closing some of the darkest chapters in my life.

2742
02:50:09.050 --> 02:50:12.800
And um,
they continue this trains,

2743
02:50:12.801 --> 02:50:16.190
planes and automobiles to try and get to freedom.

2744
02:50:16.340 --> 02:50:17.660
We boarded and finally we get to,

2745
02:50:17.661 --> 02:50:21.350
we boarded the trucks and proceeded across the Freedom Bridge to freedom
village.

2746
02:50:21.530 --> 02:50:24.530
When we arrived,
I didn't wait for the tailgate to drop.

2747
02:50:24.710 --> 02:50:26.300
I jumped right out onto the ground.

2748
02:50:26.510 --> 02:50:30.410
There were two American escorts for each of us.
They grabbed me and I thought,

2749
02:50:30.411 --> 02:50:32.720
Holy Shit.
These guys were big and muscular.

2750
02:50:33.530 --> 02:50:36.050
I quickly realized they were average guys.

2751
02:50:36.770 --> 02:50:40.460
I was just a little skinny and at one point he gets on a scale.

2752
02:50:40.461 --> 02:50:42.260
He weighed 108 pounds.

2753
02:50:43.450 --> 02:50:44.283
<v 2>Cool.</v>

2754
02:50:46.150 --> 02:50:50.470
<v 0>Our first stop was tent city in a thousand yard neutral circle in the rice</v>

2755
02:50:50.471 --> 02:50:53.650
patties we stripped show.
We stripped,

2756
02:50:53.980 --> 02:50:58.360
showered and deloused having put on slippers and pajamas.

2757
02:50:58.630 --> 02:51:00.550
We were checked by good looking nurses.

2758
02:51:00.730 --> 02:51:05.110
We stayed less than an hour before we moving to another building to get uniforms

2759
02:51:05.111 --> 02:51:07.090
and our first meal after our meal,

2760
02:51:07.091 --> 02:51:11.310
we were formed by helicopter to a replacement depot in,
in Sean.

2761
02:51:11.740 --> 02:51:16.450
It was my first helicopter flight and I sat near the door and watched Korea pass

2762
02:51:16.451 --> 02:51:20.620
and a blurb below me.
I felt like screaming,
singing and dancing,

2763
02:51:21.580 --> 02:51:25.150
but instead I remain subdued,
quiet and happy.

2764
02:51:25.151 --> 02:51:30.151
Inside 57 years had passed and I can still remember how great it felt like being

2765
02:51:32.201 --> 02:51:36.790
born again
and he gets on the phone and he says,

2766
02:51:36.791 --> 02:51:39.520
I reached my dad.
I could hear the excitement in his voice.

2767
02:51:39.521 --> 02:51:42.370
He bombarded me with questions.
Are you all right when you coming home?

2768
02:51:42.580 --> 02:51:45.280
Don't worry about me.
I'll be okay.

2769
02:51:46.320 --> 02:51:46.760
<v 2>Okay.</v>

2770
02:51:46.760 --> 02:51:50.570
<v 0>There was some kind of calmness inside of me that was difficult to describe.</v>

2771
02:51:50.870 --> 02:51:55.870
I'd been through so much that just being free and headed home was enough.

2772
02:51:58.100 --> 02:52:01.370
After worrying about Living Day in and day out,

2773
02:52:01.580 --> 02:52:05.150
I wondered if anything would ever bother me in the future.

2774
02:52:07.180 --> 02:52:09.520
The voyage back to California on the Brewster,

2775
02:52:09.521 --> 02:52:13.120
which was the ship they were on was great.
They serve three meals a day.

2776
02:52:13.960 --> 02:52:16.360
The small things mattered more now than before.

2777
02:52:17.440 --> 02:52:19.480
We were subjected to daily debriefings,

2778
02:52:19.481 --> 02:52:22.870
which were more like interrogations by intelligence officers.

2779
02:52:24.800 --> 02:52:28.490
He goes through answering a bunch of questions about what he saw and what he

2780
02:52:28.491 --> 02:52:30.860
went through when they were actually trying to figure out if there were more

2781
02:52:30.890 --> 02:52:32.670
like how many other prisoners war.

2782
02:52:32.671 --> 02:52:34.550
There are other prisoners that were left behind.

2783
02:52:37.730 --> 02:52:41.870
He finishes those and those interrogations are those questioning or Intel

2784
02:52:41.871 --> 02:52:46.280
gathering situations and then for the rest of the voyage,
I stayed on the deck.

2785
02:52:46.610 --> 02:52:49.970
I sucked in the fresh sea air and bashed in the warm breeze.

2786
02:52:50.120 --> 02:52:53.960
Everything I could hear,
smell and see was so full of life.

2787
02:52:55.520 --> 02:52:57.050
As I looked over the rail of the ship,

2788
02:52:57.051 --> 02:53:00.650
I remembered three years ago looking down at the sea and praying that I would

2789
02:53:00.651 --> 02:53:02.900
have the strength to lead my men in combat.

2790
02:53:04.020 --> 02:53:04.630
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

2791
02:53:04.630 --> 02:53:08.380
<v 0>Now I was returning by myself.
I had been born again,</v>

2792
02:53:08.560 --> 02:53:13.560
a chance to live for tomorrow to make the most of every day and never look back.

2793
02:53:16.180 --> 02:53:19.480
I had survived the greatest laboratory of human behavior,

2794
02:53:20.140 --> 02:53:23.260
one that no education could ever equal.

2795
02:53:26.170 --> 02:53:27.003
Weeks later,

2796
02:53:27.250 --> 02:53:31.000
the Golden Gate Bridge jutted out of the fog as the ship pulled into port.

2797
02:53:33.070 --> 02:53:36.910
We had a few hours before our flight,
so I left and walked around the post.

2798
02:53:37.390 --> 02:53:40.030
My path took me to the post cemetery.

2799
02:53:41.350 --> 02:53:46.350
It was very quiet and my thoughts were on all of the men and friends that will

2800
02:53:46.481 --> 02:53:47.500
no longer with me.

2801
02:53:48.820 --> 02:53:52.330
Walsh grow smoke.

2802
02:53:53.830 --> 02:53:55.540
I could feel them standing above me.

2803
02:53:57.040 --> 02:54:01.330
I hope they were smiling and happy for me because it was my men,

2804
02:54:01.480 --> 02:54:04.570
my section that had kept me motivated and alive.

2805
02:54:06.410 --> 02:54:10.100
I owed my freedom and survival to them.

2806
02:54:12.670 --> 02:54:15.910
A number of us flew to Chicago where we changed planes.

2807
02:54:16.060 --> 02:54:19.480
When the plane left Chicago,
I was the only returning prisoner of war board.

2808
02:54:20.500 --> 02:54:22.960
Although the plane was full of people,
I felt very lonely.

2809
02:54:23.140 --> 02:54:26.050
I was free and on my way home with mixed emotions,

2810
02:54:26.260 --> 02:54:31.240
I realized that I had just left men that I had lived with 24 hours a day for 34

2811
02:54:31.241 --> 02:54:32.074
months.

2812
02:54:33.720 --> 02:54:36.780
They were sad that with all the freedom surrounding me,

2813
02:54:36.781 --> 02:54:38.010
that there was an empty feeling.

2814
02:54:40.170 --> 02:54:44.070
There were also false of the ones who would never return.

2815
02:54:46.130 --> 02:54:50.150
The ones whose lives had been lost almost before they began.

2816
02:54:54.170 --> 02:54:55.670
When we landed in Philadelphia,

2817
02:54:55.671 --> 02:54:59.540
the stewardess asked if we would remain seated for just a minute while a special

2818
02:54:59.541 --> 02:55:01.430
passenger exited the plane.

2819
02:55:03.080 --> 02:55:05.330
Am I surprised that special passenger was me?

2820
02:55:06.920 --> 02:55:09.530
I walked down the stairs and onto the tarmac

2821
02:55:11.030 --> 02:55:13.670
waiting there where my mother and father,

2822
02:55:15.150 --> 02:55:18.060
they hugged and kissed me.
This time,

2823
02:55:18.660 --> 02:55:20.520
unlike on the street before the war,

2824
02:55:20.610 --> 02:55:25.610
I realized the act of affection between father and son was a wonderful thing and

2825
02:55:26.311 --> 02:55:29.280
I will never forget the emotion on my father's face.

2826
02:55:29.910 --> 02:55:31.740
As tears welled up in his eyes

2827
02:55:40.300 --> 02:55:45.300
and he goes on and there was a whole story within a story within a story in this

2828
02:55:47.171 --> 02:55:51.010
about a woman that wasn't an associate,

2829
02:55:51.011 --> 02:55:53.890
a friend and and,
and several others.
And there was,

2830
02:55:54.040 --> 02:55:58.930
there's a whole other realm to this,
but
he gets,

2831
02:55:59.000 --> 02:56:02.020
you know,
he starts to get back on with his life a little bit back to the book.

2832
02:56:02.021 --> 02:56:04.180
While I was absorbing the sounds and sights of freedom,

2833
02:56:04.181 --> 02:56:05.830
I was beginning to think about my future.

2834
02:56:06.700 --> 02:56:10.510
I had been given a second chance and was determined that I was not going to blow

2835
02:56:10.511 --> 02:56:15.400
it.
Claire and I had become inseparable.
And I was falling in love with her.

2836
02:56:15.550 --> 02:56:18.430
My only fear was that the feeling might not be mutual.

2837
02:56:19.450 --> 02:56:22.150
We had a wonderful Christmas holiday in both realized that we were definitely

2838
02:56:22.151 --> 02:56:24.730
meant to be together during the New Year's Eve party.

2839
02:56:25.120 --> 02:56:28.570
I gave clear and engagement ring.
She said yes.

2840
02:56:29.800 --> 02:56:32.260
We announced to everyone that we were going to be married.

2841
02:56:34.820 --> 02:56:36.800
There were happy people,

2842
02:56:36.830 --> 02:56:41.330
sad people and mad people to tell the story behind this statement would take

2843
02:56:41.331 --> 02:56:46.190
another book.
But five children and 56 years later we're still happily married.

2844
02:56:48.900 --> 02:56:49.430
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

2845
02:56:49.430 --> 02:56:52.130
<v 0>And from there,
and this is,</v>

2846
02:56:52.790 --> 02:56:57.560
this is like as I was researching this whole situation,

2847
02:56:57.561 --> 02:57:02.561
this is so he gets done with us and he ends up going to officer candidate school

2848
02:57:03.320 --> 02:57:04.610
in the army,
uh,

2849
02:57:05.690 --> 02:57:10.610
gets assigned to the 505th airborne infantry regiment.
That's fine.
Awesome.

2850
02:57:12.020 --> 02:57:16.460
Just outstanding.
And then he,
then he goes to special forces at Fort Bragg,

2851
02:57:16.580 --> 02:57:20.360
North Carolina.
And so he's,
you know,

2852
02:57:20.361 --> 02:57:24.680
becomes a green baret special forces guy.
And then he goes to Vietnam

2853
02:57:26.230 --> 02:57:31.230
and he is the two time commander of Project Delta in Vietnam,

2854
02:57:32.350 --> 02:57:37.150
which is like the,
the deep reconnaissance.

2855
02:57:37.900 --> 02:57:42.310
Like the,
the,
the,
the,
the uh,
the format.

2856
02:57:42.340 --> 02:57:45.550
Like this is how we do deep reconnaissance is based on project Delta and
product.

2857
02:57:45.551 --> 02:57:48.140
Delta was also had Beckwith and at Charlie Beckwith who is the,

2858
02:57:48.370 --> 02:57:52.450
the founder of Delta Force.
So,

2859
02:57:52.960 --> 02:57:53.793
you know,

2860
02:57:53.980 --> 02:57:58.980
Richardson just drives on and those deployments to Vietnam going into enemy

2861
02:57:59.951 --> 02:58:00.490
territory,

2862
02:58:00.490 --> 02:58:05.490
territory in enemy territory and ends up doing 39 years in the army

2863
02:58:09.990 --> 02:58:14.700
and,
and you know,
like you said,
has,
uh,
you know,

2864
02:58:14.730 --> 02:58:19.730
the wife and the kids and be incredible career in and after that,

2865
02:58:19.770 --> 02:58:24.030
you know,
has a civilian career,
he's still alive by the way.
Yeah.

2866
02:58:26.080 --> 02:58:30.630
Then here's what he closes out with.
He says,
every day on this journey,

2867
02:58:30.631 --> 02:58:35.460
I believed the men of the weapons platoon and my close buddies in prison.

2868
02:58:35.610 --> 02:58:40.610
We're watching me to see how I looked after my men and prepared them for

2869
02:58:41.191 --> 02:58:43.830
whatever they may have had to face.

2870
02:58:46.730 --> 02:58:50.600
I tried my best to make them proud of me.

2871
02:58:58.250 --> 02:58:59.083
So,

2872
02:59:00.710 --> 02:59:03.320
well I think that Colonel Richardson,

2873
02:59:03.350 --> 02:59:08.350
I think we can absolutely answer in the affirmative that yes,

2874
02:59:10.530 --> 02:59:15.530
I think anyone would be proud of how you handled yourself,

2875
02:59:16.190 --> 02:59:21.000
how you lead,
and then on top of that,
how you lived your life.

2876
02:59:23.190 --> 02:59:24.770
I mean,
I think that's just,
um,

2877
02:59:26.190 --> 02:59:29.880
self evident in every page of this book,
which once again,

2878
02:59:29.881 --> 02:59:33.360
valleys of death is unbelievable.

2879
02:59:33.361 --> 02:59:36.210
Book should be handed out to people.

2880
02:59:36.211 --> 02:59:39.360
It should be issued in the military as far as I'm concerned.

2881
02:59:41.430 --> 02:59:43.650
And I mean,
I think in reading the book,

2882
02:59:45.540 --> 02:59:50.430
I mean it's like your actions,
colonel,
Colonel Richardson,
his actions,

2883
02:59:50.490 --> 02:59:53.070
his behavior.
I mean,
how can you not be,

2884
02:59:53.100 --> 02:59:56.160
how can you not think to yourself that you can do a little bit better with the

2885
02:59:56.161 --> 02:59:57.210
situation that you're in

2886
02:59:59.100 --> 03:00:01.920
and realize how much people are,

2887
03:00:02.220 --> 03:00:04.740
how much human beings are capable of.

2888
03:00:07.920 --> 03:00:08.880
I don't,
I just don't,

2889
03:00:09.480 --> 03:00:12.630
I don't see how you could read this and not walk away and say,
you know what?

2890
03:00:12.660 --> 03:00:17.590
I'm going to do better.
And whatever situation you're in,

2891
03:00:17.591 --> 03:00:20.710
look,
and I know people who end up in horrible situations,

2892
03:00:20.980 --> 03:00:25.690
but no matter what that situation is,
no matter what it is,
you can,

2893
03:00:25.960 --> 03:00:27.460
you can move forward.

2894
03:00:28.880 --> 03:00:29.490
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

2895
03:00:29.490 --> 03:00:33.420
<v 0>you can move forward,
you can keep your mind positive,</v>

2896
03:00:33.421 --> 03:00:35.220
you can use your mind as your weapon

2897
03:00:39.170 --> 03:00:41.630
and also you can,
you know,

2898
03:00:41.631 --> 03:00:45.800
one of the parts in that's encompassed in that is like,
oh,
you can actually have,

2899
03:00:45.920 --> 03:00:49.560
have fun and keep your sense of humor when you're going through these terrible

2900
03:00:49.580 --> 03:00:52.430
situations,
which people ask me that all the time.
Like,
don't you,

2901
03:00:52.431 --> 03:00:54.920
do you think it's important to have a sense of humor of like,
of course I do.

2902
03:00:55.940 --> 03:01:00.370
You know,
of course I do.
But again,

2903
03:01:00.460 --> 03:01:03.400
<v 3>um,
Colonel Richardson,
if you ever hear this,</v>

2904
03:01:03.730 --> 03:01:08.730
obviously there is a wide open invite for you to come and debrief us and teach

2905
03:01:09.671 --> 03:01:13.090
us life lessons here and tell us about,

2906
03:01:13.330 --> 03:01:17.620
tell us more detail and the parts that I know I missed and things that I messed

2907
03:01:17.621 --> 03:01:20.530
up.
I apologize.
But,
uh,
thanks.

2908
03:01:21.700 --> 03:01:26.230
Thanks for your service.
Thanks for your sacrifice and thanks for showing us,

2909
03:01:28.010 --> 03:01:32.090
showing us
how to live properly,

2910
03:01:33.830 --> 03:01:35.750
even in the most dire of circumstances

2911
03:01:40.060 --> 03:01:40.893
<v 2>with that.</v>

2912
03:01:42.580 --> 03:01:47.530
<v 3>That was low.
Yeah.
I was reading this book and it was just,
I couldn't,</v>

2913
03:01:47.590 --> 03:01:50.980
I couldn't stop.
I couldn't stop.
I couldn't stop.

2914
03:01:51.040 --> 03:01:55.260
It's one of those books you just don't,
you just don't see it's,
it's,

2915
03:01:55.390 --> 03:02:00.390
it's so hard to understand like some of that combat the beginning is crazy.

2916
03:02:00.970 --> 03:02:05.680
It's crazy.
Just the situation that they were in.

2917
03:02:05.770 --> 03:02:05.981
I mean,

2918
03:02:05.981 --> 03:02:09.790
you're surrounded by the Chinese for three days and they're just a hammering

2919
03:02:09.791 --> 03:02:12.580
your perimeter on night with waves,
cumin waves,

2920
03:02:14.590 --> 03:02:19.060
and then you get the note dropped from a,
from a damn plane that says,

2921
03:02:19.180 --> 03:02:23.410
no relief is coming.
Find your way out.
Appreciate it.

2922
03:02:24.730 --> 03:02:29.500
Yeah,
and then you got to leave your wounded.
That's,

2923
03:02:29.501 --> 03:02:32.680
that's what happens.
It's like,
okay,
we either all die,
we're going to leave.

2924
03:02:32.750 --> 03:02:34.810
These are,
this is just like,
it's incredible.

2925
03:02:35.560 --> 03:02:39.970
It's incredible and you should read this or you get some sort of semblance of

2926
03:02:39.971 --> 03:02:41.950
maybe what your thoughts are going to be when you,

2927
03:02:41.951 --> 03:02:44.380
if you get into a situation like that,
whatever it is.

2928
03:02:47.940 --> 03:02:52.770
So yeah,
always learning.
Always.
And for me again,

2929
03:02:52.860 --> 03:02:56.400
I get done with this and I can't even sleep because I think to myself,

2930
03:02:56.520 --> 03:03:00.810
I've got so much opportunity as guess what?
Oh I wake up and I'm,

2931
03:03:00.870 --> 03:03:04.110
I can walk around.
I don't have shrapnel in my back.

2932
03:03:05.010 --> 03:03:09.450
I get to eat food,
whatever you like.
Yeah.
Whatever you want.
Whatever you want.

2933
03:03:10.260 --> 03:03:11.630
They're like,

2934
03:03:11.631 --> 03:03:15.410
we like people complain about working out the complain like,

2935
03:03:15.630 --> 03:03:18.780
Oh I don't feel like working on,
what are you talking about?
I got a good idea.

2936
03:03:18.781 --> 03:03:21.840
Why don't you just be quiet?
Just stop.

2937
03:03:22.290 --> 03:03:24.900
People complained that they got to go to work.
Guess what?
You're blessed.

2938
03:03:24.901 --> 03:03:26.790
You're lucky you get to go to work.

2939
03:03:27.540 --> 03:03:31.740
You're lucky or thinking about that yesterday,
the working out thing.

2940
03:03:32.340 --> 03:03:35.490
Oh like people complain only cause my arm.

2941
03:03:35.491 --> 03:03:38.820
You know you have your situations that keep you from working out or training.

2942
03:03:38.870 --> 03:03:43.410
Yeah.
And on the up,
like did you check yourself when you get it?
Well,

2943
03:03:43.860 --> 03:03:47.430
it was a moment of appreciation what it was.
You know,
when you get,
you know,

2944
03:03:47.431 --> 03:03:52.431
you get injured or sick and you feel yourself getting better.

2945
03:03:53.491 --> 03:03:55.200
Like,
oh shoot like a mark.
You know,

2946
03:03:55.201 --> 03:03:58.110
like today I felt better than I've felt this whole time kind

2947
03:03:58.110 --> 03:04:02.370
<v 4>of thing.
And that's when the,
the waves of appreciation,
you come back,
come back,</v>

2948
03:04:03.010 --> 03:04:06.710
come back.
You know what the thing is also for those people that you know,

2949
03:04:06.770 --> 03:04:08.900
when you get an injury you think it's going to last forever.

2950
03:04:08.930 --> 03:04:11.170
This is what it feels like.
It feels like it last forever.

2951
03:04:11.300 --> 03:04:14.300
And then you realize when you get back you've kind of forget that it even

2952
03:04:14.301 --> 03:04:19.070
happened.
Yeah.
So yeah,
so the eating,
and that's a big part.

2953
03:04:19.071 --> 03:04:21.980
Every time that he mentioned eating,

2954
03:04:22.160 --> 03:04:26.870
we're starving or all the weight that he lost 88 pounds.

2955
03:04:26.930 --> 03:04:31.470
Yeah.
So that for whatever reason though,
that affects me a lot when I hear it.

2956
03:04:31.471 --> 03:04:34.230
And it's like,
Oh man,
cause you picture your biceps,
wouldn't he?

2957
03:04:34.730 --> 03:04:38.030
It makes you crushed.
Crushing.
Well,

2958
03:04:38.210 --> 03:04:42.650
you know just being hungry the whole time,
you know?
Yeah.

2959
03:04:43.490 --> 03:04:47.990
What's the longest you fasted for like 24 hours a day.

2960
03:04:47.990 --> 03:04:51.500
You need to get your 72 I dunno.
I Dunno.

2961
03:04:51.560 --> 03:04:55.730
That's cause you're saying for me cause cause being hungry goes away after a

2962
03:04:55.731 --> 03:05:00.460
little while now I haven't done,
I haven't done a hunger for 34 months.
Yeah.

2963
03:05:01.240 --> 03:05:06.110
Well it goes away like after like seven hours I think or subsides like to me in

2964
03:05:06.111 --> 03:05:10.520
my experience,
it depends on who you are,
I'm sure.
But at about four,

2965
03:05:10.580 --> 03:05:14.390
five hours,
that's when that's peak hunger in 10 but either way.

2966
03:05:15.320 --> 03:05:18.830
So you don't,
when he gets back like he gets,
you know they can't even believe it.

2967
03:05:18.831 --> 03:05:22.040
Wait,
just so everyone knows,
we are in no stretch of the,

2968
03:05:22.340 --> 03:05:27.340
any sort of imagination trying to compare a fast for 24 hours with 34 months,

2969
03:05:28.941 --> 03:05:31.670
34 months.
And I mean look at,

2970
03:05:31.700 --> 03:05:35.330
look at captain plumb six years and I don't know what Hilton eat no rice ball in

2971
03:05:35.331 --> 03:05:40.130
the morning and a rice ball in the evening with filled with wood chips.

2972
03:05:41.720 --> 03:05:44.120
What's up wood chips.
You know what,

2973
03:05:44.210 --> 03:05:48.530
you go to a restaurant right now if your rice is like slightly overcook your

2974
03:05:48.550 --> 03:05:50.600
complaining miss back.

2975
03:05:50.730 --> 03:05:54.740
Yeah nevermind bugs and wood chips in there.
Yeah,
no,

2976
03:05:54.830 --> 03:05:59.690
no it ships typically know.
Yeah,
it's um,
yeah that's,

2977
03:05:59.870 --> 03:06:04.340
that's rough to say the least.
But now you know,

2978
03:06:04.430 --> 03:06:06.050
and I look,
I'm living,
you know,

2979
03:06:06.051 --> 03:06:09.420
we're living kind of this journey with them in a small way.
Right.
And He,

2980
03:06:09.440 --> 03:06:12.860
the piece they come to,
you know,
peace agreement.

2981
03:06:12.980 --> 03:06:17.930
So he's back on the boat feeling the warm air eating three times a day,

2982
03:06:18.080 --> 03:06:22.850
man.
It makes you think like now,
okay,
what,
2018 right?

2983
03:06:23.090 --> 03:06:25.280
There's like more than one tooth.
There's many,

2984
03:06:25.281 --> 03:06:29.150
many apps on your phone that you can be like,
Hey,

2985
03:06:29.151 --> 03:06:33.920
I want a triple burger,
double cheese bacon,

2986
03:06:34.090 --> 03:06:36.770
I bacon,
avocado and you know what?
I will do onions,

2987
03:06:36.800 --> 03:06:39.380
grilled onions and I'm going to need that.
A grass fed

2988
03:06:41.230 --> 03:06:45.680
steak isn't quite good enough for me over here.
And by the way,
can I get the,

2989
03:06:45.800 --> 03:06:49.010
what's that special kind of Manet's that has like something else in it?
Well,

2990
03:06:49.011 --> 03:06:53.630
there's a few.
So it's called an AOL.
Lisa,
a old,
some of that.
All right.

2991
03:06:53.980 --> 03:06:56.340
Hey only man,
cause that's all other normal

2992
03:06:56.340 --> 03:06:59.170
<v 3>man isn't quite in your,
you know,
you need to stop it.</v>

2993
03:06:59.280 --> 03:07:01.480
We just don't want that one.
We don't want to,
you don't want to tell it.

2994
03:07:01.530 --> 03:07:04.560
We want the good ones so and so.
Let me go ahead and click this doctor.

2995
03:07:04.570 --> 03:07:08.910
So spoiled and then it comes to your door in about 15 minutes and he brings it

2996
03:07:08.911 --> 03:07:12.840
there and 15 minutes drive seven.
Even if it's 22 minutes,

2997
03:07:12.841 --> 03:07:17.150
you're kind of mad because that's like,
you know I was hungry.
Yeah,
you don't,

2998
03:07:17.151 --> 03:07:21.900
you know that.
And it'll say 10 to 22 minutes on the APP.
Like people,

2999
03:07:21.960 --> 03:07:26.580
people,
they get separated from their phone and they freak out.
Right?

3000
03:07:27.510 --> 03:07:32.310
I mean you imagine this,
like you would even know what's happening.

3001
03:07:32.370 --> 03:07:34.470
Anything in the world,
you know,
nothing.

3002
03:07:34.860 --> 03:07:38.520
You know nothing of what's happening in the world with your family.

3003
03:07:40.090 --> 03:07:43.200
Nothing.
Yeah.
Yeah.

3004
03:07:43.860 --> 03:07:45.270
So with this,

3005
03:07:45.300 --> 03:07:50.300
since other people have suffered through that maybe in in our world,

3006
03:07:53.550 --> 03:07:54.090
you can,

3007
03:07:54.090 --> 03:07:57.660
you can try and get yourself on a little bit better of a path of with a little

3008
03:07:57.661 --> 03:08:00.060
bit more discipline in the world is what I'm saying.

3009
03:08:00.420 --> 03:08:02.370
I know I need to step it up harder.

3010
03:08:02.640 --> 03:08:07.090
Did you more try and make more stuff happen because the opportunities there,

3011
03:08:07.110 --> 03:08:07.943
think about,
you know,

3012
03:08:07.980 --> 03:08:12.980
and the crazy thing is Richardson's one of the people that survived because

3013
03:08:14.281 --> 03:08:18.810
there's thousands upon thousands that didn't,
that died of diarrhea,

3014
03:08:19.860 --> 03:08:23.970
that died of dysentery,
that died of gangrene and infections.

3015
03:08:24.960 --> 03:08:28.260
Yeah.
So man,

3016
03:08:28.350 --> 03:08:32.460
we got it made so you know what?
We got it made.
So make something.

3017
03:08:32.490 --> 03:08:35.430
How's that sound?
We got made?
So make something of what you got,

3018
03:08:36.120 --> 03:08:39.870
which is everything,
which is everything by the way,
unless you're in the next to,

3019
03:08:39.910 --> 03:08:43.260
unless you're drowning in a trench full of shit.

3020
03:08:44.920 --> 03:08:48.120
108 pounds with no with your legs,

3021
03:08:48.121 --> 03:08:52.800
not working with scars in your back unless you're in that situation.

3022
03:08:53.220 --> 03:08:56.510
How about you step up into like just start moving in the right direction to a

3023
03:08:56.520 --> 03:08:57.630
little.
We're doing all right.

3024
03:08:58.260 --> 03:09:02.880
Yeah and and the helpful or what makes it helpful?

3025
03:09:02.881 --> 03:09:05.130
It's like perspective,
right?
When you put it into perspective,

3026
03:09:05.131 --> 03:09:07.350
let's say you live in your life every day year I'll use to it.

3027
03:09:07.351 --> 03:09:11.220
We're all used to it and you don't feel like doing something.

3028
03:09:11.460 --> 03:09:13.620
That's really what it,
what it comes down to.

3029
03:09:13.621 --> 03:09:17.070
And of course there's different levels of not feeling like doing something.

3030
03:09:17.180 --> 03:09:20.790
It's like kind of not feeling like this one or hey,
this is straight.

3031
03:09:20.791 --> 03:09:23.740
I'm not going to happen today.
Kind of feel it.
I feel like doing me.

3032
03:09:24.270 --> 03:09:28.170
So when you put it into perspective,
I don't know if you can like,
no,

3033
03:09:28.530 --> 03:09:31.560
it's to say not ours.
It's a non argument.
Exactly right.
Didn't even fly.

3034
03:09:31.570 --> 03:09:34.350
It doesn't hold zero water whatsoever.
Exactly.
Right.

3035
03:09:34.390 --> 03:09:37.830
You can't get to a place that you don't feel that.

3036
03:09:37.831 --> 03:09:41.220
You can't convince me ever that whatever you're saying is,

3037
03:09:41.400 --> 03:09:45.540
is even remotely weighs in on the situation at all ever.
Exactly.
Right.

3038
03:09:45.570 --> 03:09:48.750
That's where I don't want to get to know whatever.
Yeah.

3039
03:09:48.751 --> 03:09:52.620
When you know it needs to get done and you don't feel it.
Let's say up,
man,

3040
03:09:52.621 --> 03:09:53.920
I haven't in two days.

3041
03:09:54.070 --> 03:09:56.860
Let's say that that's legitimate in everyday life like man,

3042
03:09:56.861 --> 03:10:00.880
you get your rest row,
but if it needs to be done after you read this book,

3043
03:10:01.690 --> 03:10:04.540
let's say you didn't sleep because you read that book and you were just up for

3044
03:10:04.541 --> 03:10:07.870
two days,
you really don't feel like going to the gym.
I'll tell you that

3045
03:10:10.990 --> 03:10:11.823
physically,

3046
03:10:11.950 --> 03:10:16.510
but I like to leave just going and doing a bicep workout

3047
03:10:18.160 --> 03:10:19.810
or whatever you know or I hope,

3048
03:10:20.470 --> 03:10:25.250
I hope as a bare minimum,
I hope people use them.

3049
03:10:25.450 --> 03:10:30.010
The mindset you can pull from the,
from the perspective you get from this,

3050
03:10:30.100 --> 03:10:33.470
I hope at a bare minimum you get your workouts at the maximum hour,

3051
03:10:33.490 --> 03:10:36.730
will you step up and just take over the world because it's sitting there right

3052
03:10:36.731 --> 03:10:40.270
in front of you.
You're not locked behind Barb wire.
You don't have,

3053
03:10:40.271 --> 03:10:43.900
your arms are strong up behind your back and hung from the ceiling.

3054
03:10:44.050 --> 03:10:47.410
So painful that you pass out so painful that you pass out,
which that's just,

3055
03:10:47.580 --> 03:10:48.550
what does that even mean?

3056
03:10:50.680 --> 03:10:53.230
It means you can kind of do anything really when you,

3057
03:10:53.260 --> 03:10:58.170
when you kind of put it into perspective.
So what are we doing?
Me and Dave Burke,

3058
03:10:58.750 --> 03:11:02.510
good deal did.
Yes,
but you know,
we'll,
we'll,
we'll,

3059
03:11:02.910 --> 03:11:07.150
he's does reads a lot of books too.
And he just like,
man,
we didn't,
we just suck.

3060
03:11:07.990 --> 03:11:11.380
And we were just pathetic.
Yeah.
I can hear it.
I'm like,
yeah.
I'm like,
yeah,

3061
03:11:11.381 --> 03:11:16.000
it's just,
you can't even,
yeah,
I sent him a note.
I was wanting to know,

3062
03:11:16.260 --> 03:11:18.800
I was like,
you did,
hey,
you had combat,
um,

3063
03:11:18.880 --> 03:11:22.240
you did combat flights in Afghanistan and Iraq.
And he's like,

3064
03:11:24.250 --> 03:11:29.000
he's like,
Bro,
come on.
You know,
that's just come on.
And I'm like,
what?
He's like,

3065
03:11:29.110 --> 03:11:32.530
yeah,
Ted,
I technically did I drop bombs in those countries?
Yes.

3066
03:11:32.550 --> 03:11:35.440
Or where they considered a combat operations?
I'm like,
yeah.
And he's like,

3067
03:11:35.441 --> 03:11:40.420
but come on.
He's like,
he's like,
I got two words for you.
He,
whoa.

3068
03:11:40.450 --> 03:11:43.490
Gima and I was like,
all right,
I get it,
man.
But yeah,
that's,

3069
03:11:43.520 --> 03:11:45.550
that's how you feel when you get done in something like this.

3070
03:11:45.551 --> 03:11:48.700
And then by the way,
he's got a,
uh,
a one,

3071
03:11:49.360 --> 03:11:51.790
one half of a paragraph where he's like,
oh,
by the way,

3072
03:11:51.791 --> 03:11:54.430
I did 39 years in the army and by the way,
I was in Vietnam and by the way,

3073
03:11:54.431 --> 03:11:57.970
I was in charge of Project Delta for two times,
twice.

3074
03:11:58.830 --> 03:12:01.520
It's just like a little sub that's like a little,

3075
03:12:01.880 --> 03:12:06.340
little like just a little sub note,
a little ps look,
postscript.

3076
03:12:07.090 --> 03:12:10.690
Jeez.
Talk about that should be its own book.

3077
03:12:10.930 --> 03:12:15.790
Each one of those command tours is its own book about doing deep reconnaissance

3078
03:12:15.820 --> 03:12:20.530
into Vietnam.
Are you kidding me?
Yeah.
I didn't even make the cut.

3079
03:12:21.280 --> 03:12:25.670
Make the cut for the colonel and said,
Oh yeah,
no,

3080
03:12:25.690 --> 03:12:28.870
I talked about it.
I put up a paragraph in there.
Half a paragraph.

3081
03:12:30.770 --> 03:12:34.730
Yeah.
So he,
not only did he power through it,
he went back.
Yeah.

3082
03:12:35.340 --> 03:12:39.460
Jeez.
That's hit me.

3083
03:12:40.180 --> 03:12:44.300
And he did power through it by the way.
He did it like,
no,

3084
03:12:44.320 --> 03:12:47.220
he held on the line.
He didn't.

3085
03:12:47.510 --> 03:12:50.770
That part where he's talking about don't let them laugh at you.
Don't let them.

3086
03:12:51.950 --> 03:12:55.490
I underlined that and highlighted it and then I put stars by it because that's

3087
03:12:55.491 --> 03:12:57.530
the kind of thing that you think about.
Like,

3088
03:12:58.880 --> 03:13:02.420
like we know the world sometimes seems like it's having a joke with you.

3089
03:13:02.890 --> 03:13:05.690
Like it's like the joke is on you.
You ever wake up,
you're like,

3090
03:13:05.691 --> 03:13:08.750
the joke is on the joke's on me in the words and laughing at me.

3091
03:13:09.120 --> 03:13:13.790
Like that's not a good feeling,
right?
No.
Won't let that happen.
No,

3092
03:13:13.940 --> 03:13:18.530
you don't.
And Yeah,
thank you man.
See,
even keeping a sense of humor.

3093
03:13:18.531 --> 03:13:22.940
All this man.
So it's a humor.
Laughing.

3094
03:13:23.240 --> 03:13:26.370
That was a shitty situation.
Tuition.
Yes sir.
It was never.

3095
03:13:26.630 --> 03:13:28.850
Next time you think about something being shitty,

3096
03:13:28.851 --> 03:13:31.490
now you know what a true shitty situation is.

3097
03:13:32.150 --> 03:13:36.510
We all knew now we all now have a new definition of what a shitty situation is.

3098
03:13:36.540 --> 03:13:40.130
Standard.
That's the standard.
That's it.
That's the standard.

3099
03:13:40.910 --> 03:13:44.930
That's where you're at.
So well,
yeah.

3100
03:13:45.170 --> 03:13:49.310
So we're on the path.
Like there's no one is off the path anymore.

3101
03:13:50.040 --> 03:13:53.440
We can't,
you're not allowed to just not even allowed on the path.
Right.

3102
03:13:53.580 --> 03:13:56.410
So when you,
when you started,
you did three,
if you have it all ready,

3103
03:13:56.660 --> 03:14:00.680
which most of us have.
Holy Cow.
Oh yeah.

3104
03:14:00.770 --> 03:14:04.890
It's like everyone that's thinking that's still on the fence,
right?
Just,

3105
03:14:04.940 --> 03:14:08.390
just get over the fence because every single person I know,

3106
03:14:08.450 --> 03:14:12.650
I won't say every single person there is a what percentage.

3107
03:14:12.710 --> 03:14:13.880
I've heard feedback,

3108
03:14:13.881 --> 03:14:18.881
I think from a total feedback of three people and it might only be two that

3109
03:14:19.551 --> 03:14:24.350
actually just didn't like it.
Jujitsu,
actually it's three,
one female,

3110
03:14:24.500 --> 03:14:29.180
two males,
the one,
the one male I went back and forth with for a while,

3111
03:14:29.330 --> 03:14:31.460
you know,
he was like hitting me up on Twitter.
This was pretty early on.

3112
03:14:31.461 --> 03:14:34.670
He's just like,
I just don't like it.
I'm like to perform grinding on me.
And,

3113
03:14:35.180 --> 03:14:38.900
and finally with that guy,
he just didn't want to do it,
man.
And I was like,
look,

3114
03:14:38.960 --> 03:14:41.990
do you know,
hey cool.
You don't want to ruin your life.

3115
03:14:42.110 --> 03:14:44.790
You don't make this into a living hell because you do something.
You did,

3116
03:14:44.791 --> 03:14:45.624
you fully hate.

3117
03:14:46.190 --> 03:14:50.510
It wasn't until the next guy that bitterly complained that I was like,
listen,

3118
03:14:50.810 --> 03:14:53.750
okay,
here's the plan.
Keep doing it until you submit someone.

3119
03:14:53.751 --> 03:14:55.570
Once you submit someone you can stop.
Yeah.

3120
03:14:55.850 --> 03:14:58.990
I didn't think of that plan yet until the guy number two and the other one who

3121
03:14:58.991 --> 03:15:02.360
was a female that it was two things,
uh,

3122
03:15:02.570 --> 03:15:04.750
didn't really like it but more important.

3123
03:15:04.770 --> 03:15:09.370
Didn't have anywhere to train and kind of just got off the path.
But yeah.
So uh,

3124
03:15:09.740 --> 03:15:14.540
but that's three out of many and many,
many,
many.

3125
03:15:14.600 --> 03:15:18.140
I mean most people are like,
oh yeah,

3126
03:15:18.500 --> 03:15:21.170
I'm obsessed now.
I'm obsessed.
Yeah.
Win or lose.

3127
03:15:21.200 --> 03:15:24.830
Like sometimes people will be like,
Hey,
I got beat up for hour and a half.

3128
03:15:25.100 --> 03:15:27.800
Well everyone says,
just went to my first Jujitsu class,

3129
03:15:27.801 --> 03:15:31.460
got choked 28 times by a 14 year old kid.
I love it.

3130
03:15:32.780 --> 03:15:34.400
If you've got your ego in check,
you say,
I love it.

3131
03:15:34.430 --> 03:15:36.530
If you don't got your ego in check,
you're like,
you know,

3132
03:15:36.531 --> 03:15:39.860
I don't know if this is for me.
I couldn't punch him.
Don't try and punch him.

3133
03:15:40.040 --> 03:15:42.410
Try and punch that 14 year old zoo at that triangle feels like then

3134
03:15:44.090 --> 03:15:46.880
cause it doesn't feel good.
Yeah.
People go hard.

3135
03:15:47.070 --> 03:15:50.500
And we ever had dean go hard on a triangle on you.
Like actually often,

3136
03:15:50.510 --> 03:15:53.850
authentically he did a triangle meat to me as he was just showing me something.

3137
03:15:53.910 --> 03:15:57.570
He locked that triangle up so tight.
I felt that in my lower back.

3138
03:15:57.780 --> 03:16:02.710
That doesn't even make sense.
It moved my spinal cord.
Yeah.

3139
03:16:02.730 --> 03:16:07.560
Don't,
I don't doubt it for sure,
but all right,
so we are doing Jujitsu.

3140
03:16:07.770 --> 03:16:11.970
That's Kinda,
that's kind of the deal.
Do you get,
what rash guard do you get?

3141
03:16:12.000 --> 03:16:16.060
Hey look,
there's plenty geese.
Plenty rash guards.
Not really all from origin.

3142
03:16:16.440 --> 03:16:19.590
There's only one.
Well the good news is,

3143
03:16:19.740 --> 03:16:23.400
and I was talking to some folks at the muster about this few times actually,

3144
03:16:23.401 --> 03:16:26.430
you know,
hey,
what gee should I get?
They're still asking that question.

3145
03:16:26.730 --> 03:16:31.450
That's the thing.
They already know the origin game.
Oh one G which should I get?

3146
03:16:32.030 --> 03:16:34.920
Get whatever one you want more advanced in our quest.
Yeah.

3147
03:16:34.920 --> 03:16:38.190
Because it's not the kind,
even if you get the,
you know how there's like levels,

3148
03:16:38.191 --> 03:16:40.920
if you even want to call them that will say price point,
if you will.

3149
03:16:40.950 --> 03:16:43.170
Like the Murrick some more expensive ones.

3150
03:16:43.380 --> 03:16:46.180
It's not the kind of where you get that and then you come in as a new white belt

3151
03:16:46.181 --> 03:16:49.920
and was like,
Ooh,
you're kind of flossing hard with that,
that you know.
No,

3152
03:16:49.921 --> 03:16:53.010
like if you get something like in wrestling,
if you were gold shoes and rusted,

3153
03:16:53.240 --> 03:16:55.590
that's exactly right.
It's not like that.
It's not like that.

3154
03:16:55.670 --> 03:17:00.480
Or You dye your hair or,
yes.
Okay.
That's a little statement as a statement.
Yeah.

3155
03:17:00.640 --> 03:17:05.640
He's,
he's not like that orange hair.
Yeah.
I'm,
I'm really good.
He's not like that.

3156
03:17:05.641 --> 03:17:09.720
No,
no sir.
He's just to get functional.
Yeah,
man.
You know,
maybe you know,
I don't,

3157
03:17:09.721 --> 03:17:12.080
obviously I don't go with Pete and Buehler courier.

3158
03:17:12.100 --> 03:17:14.940
Why are we doing this or this is per ticket,
so I don't know,

3159
03:17:14.941 --> 03:17:18.180
but I'm assuming maybe it took more to make certain ones or whatever,
but get,

3160
03:17:18.240 --> 03:17:21.540
get to the point is get whichever one you want.
Straight up,

3161
03:17:22.770 --> 03:17:27.450
lightweight,
heavyweight,
whatever from origin main.com.
True.

3162
03:17:27.930 --> 03:17:31.080
True.
Also you got rash guards.
If,

3163
03:17:31.130 --> 03:17:36.130
if you want a rash guard then you can get a little git rash guard.

3164
03:17:36.510 --> 03:17:41.160
You got t shirts as well at from origin.

3165
03:17:41.190 --> 03:17:45.270
So basic like clothing and guess what we're we're making right now at this time

3166
03:17:46.170 --> 03:17:47.360
denim.
Yeah.

3167
03:17:50.370 --> 03:17:54.690
Oh I'm getting my,
I haven't gotten my pair yet,
but yeah,
we're making jeans.

3168
03:17:54.720 --> 03:17:58.260
So just be on standby.
It's going to take a little while to get that ramped up.

3169
03:17:58.710 --> 03:18:02.820
But it looked good though.
I saw pictures.
Oh yeah,
that's already posted them.

3170
03:18:02.910 --> 03:18:06.030
Yeah.
Yeah we will be.
We'll be making cause you know why?

3171
03:18:06.300 --> 03:18:10.620
Because everyone needs every human wears jeans.
Yeah.

3172
03:18:10.680 --> 03:18:11.910
Cause they're functional.
Yeah.

3173
03:18:12.480 --> 03:18:17.480
So every human needs genes and if everyone does then why not get jeans that are

3174
03:18:18.450 --> 03:18:23.450
made here made with the highest quality now all that stuff anyways,

3175
03:18:24.300 --> 03:18:28.830
so we have genes are common.
We also got some supplements.
Yup.
Jocko supplements.

3176
03:18:28.831 --> 03:18:30.390
So what joint warfare,

3177
03:18:30.720 --> 03:18:34.530
Krill oil discipline mark and where he could milk.

3178
03:18:34.740 --> 03:18:38.340
So what are these cover the most important elements?

3179
03:18:38.370 --> 03:18:43.200
I think of slop supplementation.
So joints,

3180
03:18:43.860 --> 03:18:46.890
those are going to go out on you.
That's it.
If you're into lifting heavy,

3181
03:18:46.980 --> 03:18:48.100
did Jujitsu hard you

3182
03:18:48.100 --> 03:18:52.720
<v 4>into you work hard if you had like a manual labor type job?
Yup.
Moving company.</v>

3183
03:18:52.790 --> 03:18:54.490
Yeah.
I know you are a mover.

3184
03:18:54.550 --> 03:18:58.180
I was American looser bouncer that that wasn't very hard.

3185
03:18:59.590 --> 03:19:01.720
I mean you'd have to work at all night.
Yes.

3186
03:19:01.721 --> 03:19:06.010
On your like feet and knees maybe depending.
But uh,
I would say,
you know,

3187
03:19:06.040 --> 03:19:09.430
just one year I would say the workouts,
the workouts get your joints.

3188
03:19:09.431 --> 03:19:12.190
I think especially over time,
especially if you're going very often.

3189
03:19:12.670 --> 03:19:14.710
And here's one of the things about the joint stuff.

3190
03:19:16.150 --> 03:19:19.720
A big part of it is you don't realize how much that,

3191
03:19:19.780 --> 03:19:24.250
how much benefit there is to taking krill oil and joint warfare on a regular

3192
03:19:24.251 --> 03:19:25.290
basis until you

3193
03:19:25.610 --> 03:19:29.680
<v 3>yeah.
Well until or until you stop.
Oh yeah.
Big Time.
Which I haven't stopped.</v>

3194
03:19:29.830 --> 03:19:34.210
I can't even answer that question.
But you've told us.
Yes.
So he had joy,
warfare,

3195
03:19:34.690 --> 03:19:38.470
Krill oil discipline.
Which discipline?
Like during the monster,

3196
03:19:38.471 --> 03:19:40.600
I drink a lot of discipline because like,
you know,

3197
03:19:40.601 --> 03:19:44.170
it's like go time the whole time.
Yeah.
So that's what now I'll tell you,

3198
03:19:44.200 --> 03:19:47.560
we got something else coming out.
We've got disciplined in little pills,

3199
03:19:47.590 --> 03:19:49.450
go pills and I'll tell you why.

3200
03:19:49.990 --> 03:19:54.990
I can't always pound right a bunch of discipline drink before.

3201
03:19:56.470 --> 03:19:58.300
Let's say I'm going out to speak sir.

3202
03:19:58.480 --> 03:20:01.810
I don't want to have to like hit the head in the middle of the speech because I

3203
03:20:01.900 --> 03:20:05.770
drink like a bottle of water right before I went out there.
So anyways,

3204
03:20:05.980 --> 03:20:06.521
I was like,
Hey,

3205
03:20:06.521 --> 03:20:09.430
can we make these things in little pills that I can take that can kind of get me

3206
03:20:09.910 --> 03:20:12.100
in the rock and roll mode real quick?
So yeah,

3207
03:20:12.210 --> 03:20:16.350
<v 4>got those coming comments.
Not to mention you got to mix it up a big deal,</v>

3208
03:20:16.351 --> 03:20:20.940
but if you're on the good,
good girl.
Yeah know.
So yeah,
discipline go,
go pills

3209
03:20:21.210 --> 03:20:24.150
<v 3>common and they got a little bit of nootropic in them.</v>

3210
03:20:24.151 --> 03:20:26.520
They've got a little bit of caffeine in them.
They had got a little bit of go,

3211
03:20:26.560 --> 03:20:28.650
you know,
a little bit too good.
That's the main ingredient,

3212
03:20:28.651 --> 03:20:32.940
the meeting ingredient.
Just go dig it.
Hey also,
okay,

3213
03:20:32.941 --> 03:20:34.590
so as we know,

3214
03:20:34.770 --> 03:20:39.770
the warrior kid mark is live and as we also know is tasting well.

3215
03:20:40.210 --> 03:20:44.340
It's live.
It's live.
It was this morning I was,

3216
03:20:45.150 --> 03:20:49.170
I was making some strawberry milk for the kids for me,

3217
03:20:49.200 --> 03:20:53.160
but it's the kids mark and everyone in my house is freaking going nuts.

3218
03:20:53.280 --> 03:20:57.510
Everyone in my house is just drinking strawberry milk except for my youngest

3219
03:20:57.511 --> 03:20:59.310
daughter.
She's all about the chocolate.

3220
03:20:59.820 --> 03:21:04.820
But somebody took the milk scoop from the ward and like they was gone.

3221
03:21:05.700 --> 03:21:10.020
And this is where I realized there's something going on because I said to my

3222
03:21:10.021 --> 03:21:13.800
wife,
I said,
hey,
where's,
I said,
hey,
where's the scoop for the,

3223
03:21:14.040 --> 03:21:15.570
for the strawberry quick,

3224
03:21:16.440 --> 03:21:21.440
I actually called it strawberry quick because it tastes and now,

3225
03:21:22.440 --> 03:21:26.260
now I was talking to Brian and Brian's got Pete.
People are like notify gambit.

3226
03:21:26.310 --> 03:21:28.390
They're getting like putting the stall chick

3227
03:21:30.420 --> 03:21:34.500
memories of drinking Nestle's Quik cause that's where we're at.

3228
03:21:34.560 --> 03:21:37.680
The strawberry one,
the chocolate one doesn't taste as much,

3229
03:21:37.681 --> 03:21:39.780
like it tastes delicious but it doesn't taste the same.

3230
03:21:39.900 --> 03:21:42.020
Like whatever the quick like,

3231
03:21:42.230 --> 03:21:45.640
like exactly like quick does because that quick let's face it,
isn't,

3232
03:21:45.740 --> 03:21:48.440
isn't really that great,
but the strawberry quick is great.

3233
03:21:49.310 --> 03:21:51.860
Our chocolate is probably better than,
than the mass of these chocolate.

3234
03:21:52.280 --> 03:21:56.210
The strawberry quick is almost a replica.
And this is he legal to,

3235
03:21:56.211 --> 03:22:00.590
for me to say this is like comparing the brands or something like man,
okay.

3236
03:22:00.930 --> 03:22:05.510
Legal yet.
No,
no,
no.
All good.
And the nostalgia part that is,
that is something,

3237
03:22:05.511 --> 03:22:06.650
and I felt that too,

3238
03:22:06.710 --> 03:22:11.710
the one part then the SLG I used to get from the seven 11.

3239
03:22:12.670 --> 03:22:15.200
Yeah.
The strawberry quick from the seven 11.
Yeah.

3240
03:22:15.750 --> 03:22:18.280
We've got it from a store called big safe uncle.

3241
03:22:22.430 --> 03:22:26.160
But yeah,
that's for the protein and the regular milk.
That's for the protein.
So,

3242
03:22:26.400 --> 03:22:31.280
and so this is the other thing I wanted to say is as soon as I had the warrior

3243
03:22:31.281 --> 03:22:35.630
kids strawberry milk,
I texted Brian 14 seconds later,
it said,

3244
03:22:35.900 --> 03:22:39.800
make adult,
you know,
milk strawberry.

3245
03:22:39.830 --> 03:22:43.880
So it's in the works.
Um,
there's a couple,

3246
03:22:44.080 --> 03:22:46.310
there's you can't just say,

3247
03:22:46.311 --> 03:22:50.030
well I'll just double up because there's a little bit more protein in it in the,

3248
03:22:50.090 --> 03:22:55.090
you know you want to get a little bit more protein in the adult milk so that's

3249
03:22:55.360 --> 03:22:58.430
cool.
For those of you that are freaking out in the meantime,

3250
03:22:58.490 --> 03:23:02.450
take two scoops of two scoops of warrior kid mall.
Can you still do it?
All right.

3251
03:23:03.260 --> 03:23:07.970
Yes you are.
If you want to represent

3252
03:23:09.470 --> 03:23:14.120
the discipline equals freedom way,
whose discipline does equal freedom?

3253
03:23:14.750 --> 03:23:19.340
I think the more you grow up in life and embrace the discipline,

3254
03:23:19.480 --> 03:23:21.500
you understand that more because there are,

3255
03:23:21.650 --> 03:23:25.990
there are levels of understanding to the core to the core anyway.

3256
03:23:26.000 --> 03:23:29.930
If you want to represent,
go to Jocko store.com cause com has a store.

3257
03:23:30.320 --> 03:23:35.180
Which shirts on their hoodies?
Any,
any second now?

3258
03:23:35.300 --> 03:23:38.060
Hoodies,
Maura hoods or hoodies,
winter hoodies.

3259
03:23:38.090 --> 03:23:40.580
Well Michigan hoodies.

3260
03:23:40.790 --> 03:23:44.360
If your winter hoodies,
Minnesota,

3261
03:23:44.990 --> 03:23:49.880
potentially Hawaii.
They're not quite there.
Mainland,

3262
03:23:50.510 --> 03:23:51.950
mainland or at least we're in the mainland.

3263
03:23:52.100 --> 03:23:55.730
We are in the mainland in these cities for sure.
Maine.
What about my people?

3264
03:23:55.880 --> 03:24:00.110
Probably.
Yeah.
All right.
Anyway.
The point is,
is a lot of cool stuff on there.

3265
03:24:00.140 --> 03:24:03.330
I think it's cool.
DEF core difficult stuff to the car.

3266
03:24:04.200 --> 03:24:07.490
All things technically or def core.

3267
03:24:08.040 --> 03:24:11.180
Technically true.
I'm going to leave it at that.
Also,

3268
03:24:12.620 --> 03:24:16.510
hats on there and women's stuff.
Also rash guards too,
and the,

3269
03:24:16.560 --> 03:24:20.000
the hats are legit.
Yeah.
Truckers,
hats,
by the way,

3270
03:24:20.660 --> 03:24:24.890
does a year that are moral,
more old school in my opinion.
Truckers,

3271
03:24:24.891 --> 03:24:28.040
hats are more old school.
That's what I wore when I was a kid.
Truckers hats.

3272
03:24:28.270 --> 03:24:30.230
They come in and out though.
You know how they go out.

3273
03:24:30.231 --> 03:24:33.000
Then they come back in this style.
That's just the I've been wearing.

3274
03:24:33.090 --> 03:24:36.140
You didn't know about style.
Yeah.
I forgot.
I forgot.
Anyway,
flex it.

3275
03:24:36.141 --> 03:24:40.220
Hats on there as well.
A lot of good stuff.
If you want something,
get something.

3276
03:24:40.640 --> 03:24:44.220
Did we do represent while staying on the path?

3277
03:24:44.250 --> 03:24:49.250
There's some tea on the Doco t's on there and various other things.

3289
03:25:29.470 --> 03:25:32.940
And also don't forget about the war.
Your kid podcast,

3290
03:25:33.690 --> 03:25:36.240
the warrior kid podcast.
You can ask kids,

3291
03:25:36.241 --> 03:25:41.241
ask questions to uncle Jake and Uncle Jake tells stories about when he was a kid

3292
03:25:41.940 --> 03:25:46.410
and where he got his way from,
where he,

3293
03:25:46.470 --> 03:25:47.840
where he uncovered the way.
Also,

3294
03:25:47.850 --> 03:25:51.690
you've got the warrior kids soap from Irish oaks ranch.com.

3295
03:25:52.530 --> 03:25:56.430
Aiden's up there.
He's taken advantage of life.
Guess what?
You got goats.

3296
03:25:56.460 --> 03:26:00.270
You're in California.
You can't sell goat milk.
Guess what?
You can do make soap.

3297
03:26:00.930 --> 03:26:04.290
That's what Aiden's doing.
Young Aiden.
I was watching shark tank,

3298
03:26:05.030 --> 03:26:07.110
the entrepreneurship and you know,

3299
03:26:07.111 --> 03:26:11.220
there's a kid on there doing his thing and wasn't making respect.
Uh,
what was it?

3300
03:26:11.221 --> 03:26:15.240
Some glue,
some washable glue user using it for Legos,

3301
03:26:15.241 --> 03:26:19.410
which was kind of odd,
but I guess if you're anyone at lung,
but I thought it,

3302
03:26:19.470 --> 03:26:23.660
I thought about Aiden and the Jocko soap c eight and up there with chocolate

3303
03:26:23.661 --> 03:26:27.960
next to them or whatever you say all the time anyway.

3304
03:26:29.370 --> 03:26:32.220
And while you're in the subscribe mode,

3305
03:26:32.700 --> 03:26:37.290
then also subscribed to the,
the youtube channel,

3306
03:26:37.350 --> 03:26:41.490
the Jocko podcasts or youtube channel if you want to see echoes videos,

3307
03:26:41.491 --> 03:26:44.580
which he puts all kinds of time and effort into real super.

3308
03:26:45.180 --> 03:26:47.370
He gets super things that crazy about it.

3309
03:26:47.400 --> 03:26:52.400
It makes everything explode and then reflecting off of things as music,

3310
03:26:54.000 --> 03:26:55.960
cello,
music do.

3311
03:26:57.570 --> 03:27:01.710
So that's on the youtube channel and we've got some other things planned for the

3312
03:27:01.711 --> 03:27:05.580
youtube channel coming shortly.
Coming quickly.
We'll see.

3313
03:27:06.180 --> 03:27:09.420
I don't know if quickly is really a word that we used a lot back in Hawaii,

3314
03:27:09.421 --> 03:27:12.870
but you know,
we'll do our best and we're going to,
we're making it happen.

3315
03:27:12.900 --> 03:27:14.370
And then you got psychological warfare,

3316
03:27:14.580 --> 03:27:18.510
little little album with some tracks to kind of be pushed through some of those

3317
03:27:18.511 --> 03:27:21.210
moments of weakness where you're thinking you'd just want to eat that donut,

3318
03:27:21.240 --> 03:27:25.050
you don't need to know,
just don't need to.
So that'll help you out.

3319
03:27:25.051 --> 03:27:29.160
And we're also making a second psychological warfare album.

3320
03:27:29.161 --> 03:27:32.020
And if you want that then you can,
uh,
if you want to,
if he wants,

3321
03:27:32.070 --> 03:27:36.600
if you have a special request for that,
should I do some stop smoking cigarettes?

3322
03:27:36.780 --> 03:27:41.510
I've never smoked cigarettes.
I think you should at least do it.

3323
03:27:41.650 --> 03:27:41.980
And then

3324
03:27:41.980 --> 03:27:45.190
<v 4>if it's like,
yeah,
cause I,
I would think,
but as far as potential problems,</v>

3325
03:27:45.191 --> 03:27:48.640
you might run into like,
you know,
how like on the other ones like you can,
I get,

3326
03:27:48.641 --> 03:27:52.330
you can relate,
you know,
kind of what to say about it.
You know,
like,
hey,

3327
03:27:52.331 --> 03:27:55.420
you're thinking this or whatever.
Um,
yeah.
With the smoking.

3328
03:27:55.930 --> 03:27:59.260
Maybe you could compare it to something maybe felt that you might be addicted to

3329
03:27:59.261 --> 03:28:04.150
in the past,
but on an,
I think that's the whole,
that's a whole different game.

3330
03:28:04.151 --> 03:28:08.080
I'm pretty,
you know?
Yeah.
But I think again,

3331
03:28:08.081 --> 03:28:11.860
I think it's a different game to really like recruit tons and to be addicted to

3332
03:28:11.861 --> 03:28:15.530
smoking.
I don't know.
I've never smoked.
Well that,
yeah,

3333
03:28:15.531 --> 03:28:19.800
that's what that one's available.
Wherever you get mp3s,
iTunes,
Google play.
What

3334
03:28:21.310 --> 03:28:25.300
also,
if you're on the path working out,
that's part of it,
right?

3335
03:28:25.330 --> 03:28:30.240
My four things working out was wonderful and you want a very every workout.

3336
03:28:30.250 --> 03:28:33.700
So this is where you get your kettle bells on it.
On it.
Dot Tom.
Calm talk.

3337
03:28:33.730 --> 03:28:38.260
It's called on.com/jocko/jocko.
By the way,

3338
03:28:38.710 --> 03:28:42.050
get some rings.
Kettlebells,
Mace,

3339
03:28:43.100 --> 03:28:46.030
you got to the Macy's.
Dangerous.
If you don't know what you're doing.

3340
03:28:46.060 --> 03:28:48.630
So the goals that may seem like they're not heavy.
Yeah.

3341
03:28:48.640 --> 03:28:50.690
And you picked that thing up and you're like,
yeah,
big.

3342
03:28:50.740 --> 03:28:53.650
What's the big long thing with a ball in the end called?
Oh,
that's the mace.
No,

3343
03:28:53.651 --> 03:28:54.590
I'm thinking about the club.

3344
03:28:54.600 --> 03:28:57.820
The club bells bells are way more dangerous than the mace.
Yeah.

3345
03:28:57.821 --> 03:28:59.650
And that's what I'm saying where the club bells,

3346
03:28:59.651 --> 03:29:02.830
if you drop a club belt on your toe,
you will lose your toe.
Yeah.

3347
03:29:02.831 --> 03:29:07.240
And the work that should be called a tow remover.
If you are in a hospital,

3348
03:29:07.280 --> 03:29:09.670
then you were like,
oh,
you got a bad toe,
we're going to have to remove it.
Okay,

3349
03:29:09.671 --> 03:29:12.800
cool.
Come over here,
whack.
That thing's gone.
The club,

3350
03:29:13.180 --> 03:29:16.120
I like to work out barefoot sometimes.
Yeah.
And like you,

3351
03:29:16.300 --> 03:29:19.960
that's a dangerous proposition.
So be careful.
Just be,
yeah.
And really,

3352
03:29:19.961 --> 03:29:22.480
I mean a sane it,
it makes it sound like,
oh,

3353
03:29:22.481 --> 03:29:24.160
like almost more dangerous than it really.
Well,

3354
03:29:24.280 --> 03:29:28.940
my point is go on there and look at the workouts first.

3355
03:29:29.620 --> 03:29:32.440
Cause I've never done it and I still have all my toes.
I,
well I've never,

3356
03:29:32.470 --> 03:29:34.870
I've worked out with it a bunch and they still have all my toes.

3357
03:29:34.871 --> 03:29:38.140
So it's not that big of a deal.
But when you picked it up you're like,
Dang,

3358
03:29:38.141 --> 03:29:41.230
this is kind of it.
And then when you swing it and you're like,
Whoa,
Whoa,
Whoa,

3359
03:29:41.231 --> 03:29:44.320
let me get the smaller one.
Yeah,
well that's how it was anyway.
But anyway,

3360
03:29:44.321 --> 03:29:48.120
you can get that stuff.
Their rings are a big deal in my opinion.
Rings.
Yeah,

3361
03:29:48.130 --> 03:29:50.280
definitely.
You should have rings if you don't have rings to get them.
You see?

3362
03:29:50.320 --> 03:29:52.270
I said in my opinion like I just know about them.

3363
03:29:52.271 --> 03:29:56.170
Even though you were preaching rings from now I'm signed onto the rink.

3364
03:29:56.230 --> 03:29:57.940
How's the big stability muscles?

3365
03:30:00.790 --> 03:30:03.740
They're stable.
They're stable anyway.
Yeah.

3366
03:30:03.800 --> 03:30:06.340
I posted a picture of my son.

3367
03:30:06.550 --> 03:30:09.820
I don't really post that many pictures of my kids all the time or nothing like

3368
03:30:09.821 --> 03:30:13.570
that.
Every once in a while.
Sure.
But he was lifting.

3369
03:30:13.660 --> 03:30:16.000
You don't when you lift and it's like he just jumps in and says,

3370
03:30:16.001 --> 03:30:19.180
my attorney doesn't deadlift,
doesn't pretty good.
Kids have good form by the way.

3371
03:30:19.240 --> 03:30:22.600
Yes they do.
So he does a dead lift on one of the little on it.

3372
03:30:23.080 --> 03:30:27.730
Kettle bell is a smaller ones too.
Yeah,
and he's learned much.
Watch me.

3373
03:30:28.250 --> 03:30:32.440
He did.
Was a weight 18 pounds.
How much does he weigh?
I don't know,

3374
03:30:33.400 --> 03:30:37.330
18 pounds.
Here's a little light.
It was like he did it easy.
Well anyway,

3375
03:30:37.331 --> 03:30:39.970
I take it.
Why don't you get him a bit of color though?

3376
03:30:39.990 --> 03:30:42.200
<v 3>He can start pushing the envelope or whatever.
But look,</v>

3377
03:30:42.201 --> 03:30:44.050
we're not going to raise your kid to be reading.
No,

3378
03:30:44.330 --> 03:30:47.000
I'm just saying that's what he did at that time.
And I took a picture.

3379
03:30:47.001 --> 03:30:48.950
I mean I'm not saying we were maxing out,

3380
03:30:48.951 --> 03:30:52.700
me and my two year old maxing out dead lift and he only could do eight days.

3381
03:30:52.730 --> 03:30:55.730
That's not what I'm saying.
I'm saying.
Anyway,
I took a picture of it

3382
03:30:57.290 --> 03:30:59.600
so you can see it and it's,
and it has,

3383
03:30:59.780 --> 03:31:01.790
I looked at the picture and I can evaluate it.
I was like,

3384
03:31:01.791 --> 03:31:05.540
this is a good picture because it has like all the kettle know kind of scattered

3385
03:31:05.541 --> 03:31:09.140
about.
You framed it up.
Well technically,
I mean truth be told I was,

3386
03:31:09.210 --> 03:31:11.180
I'm making a video.
Oh,
okay.

3387
03:31:11.990 --> 03:31:15.920
Which may or may not have warrior kid themes.
Oh to it.

3388
03:31:16.790 --> 03:31:21.140
So while I was doing,
I picked that picture anyway,
it looks good on,

3389
03:31:21.141 --> 03:31:25.310
it was highly represented in that picture.
I liked it.
Let me tell you this.
Uh,

3390
03:31:26.300 --> 03:31:30.410
maybe if you would give your kid some Jocko white tea,

3391
03:31:30.530 --> 03:31:32.960
he would be able to deadlift more than 18 pounds.

3392
03:31:33.140 --> 03:31:35.870
He would might be able to deadlift 8,000 pounds.
In fact,

3393
03:31:36.140 --> 03:31:39.830
there's an actual guarantee because there's no age minimum requirement.

3394
03:31:40.100 --> 03:31:43.970
If you get that kid on the Jocko white tea,
there's the 800 pound deadlift.

3395
03:31:44.120 --> 03:31:47.960
Actually my girl drink two drinks,
legitimate drinks,

3396
03:31:48.140 --> 03:31:52.960
my wife's Jocko white tea and she dead lifted 8,000 barrels per yes.
Yup.

3397
03:31:53.160 --> 03:31:55.580
Proven hundred percent kids.
Everything Jocko white tea.

3398
03:31:55.610 --> 03:32:00.610
You can get the cams which are ready to drink or you can get the tea bags that

3399
03:32:00.741 --> 03:32:05.300
you have to boil water too big.
Oh God.
I don't want it to boil water.

3400
03:32:07.360 --> 03:32:11.540
And then that,
then you have to seek,
you have to seep it a what?

3401
03:32:11.570 --> 03:32:14.820
When you in the morning.
I don't drink uh,

3402
03:32:14.900 --> 03:32:18.380
Jocko white tea warm in the morning every morning.

3403
03:32:18.650 --> 03:32:21.680
But there's certain situ like at the muster.
Sure.
Oh,
I'm all about it.

3404
03:32:22.040 --> 03:32:24.710
And you know what his seat means?

3405
03:32:24.711 --> 03:32:28.340
Seat means you put the tea bag in there and you let it sit for a little while

3406
03:32:28.570 --> 03:32:31.280
and for some people they pull it out.
I just leave it in there the whole time.

3407
03:32:31.550 --> 03:32:35.360
You know Allen Allen stages.
Oh,

3408
03:32:35.361 --> 03:32:39.940
Ellen from monster,
Monster Allen.
He's stages.
He stays.

3409
03:32:40.640 --> 03:32:45.010
When I get up to the podium,
it's staged and I'm just like,

3410
03:32:46.360 --> 03:32:48.980
so what's good about that is it's,
I don't know,

3411
03:32:48.981 --> 03:32:52.460
in the morning time we just have a little warm while I guess it's hot,

3412
03:32:52.490 --> 03:32:55.760
technically is hot,
but I drink it warm.
Yeah,
I'm with you.

3413
03:32:55.910 --> 03:33:00.380
I don't know that there's a better beverage for that little morning little

3414
03:33:00.380 --> 03:33:03.120
morning scenario.
Yeah,
those a little mornings.
No,

3415
03:33:03.121 --> 03:33:07.340
just a little little cup of dark or white tea so you can get that.
Also,

3416
03:33:07.341 --> 03:33:08.174
I've got some books.

3417
03:33:09.260 --> 03:33:13.310
I got the way the warrior kid one end too,

3418
03:33:13.550 --> 03:33:15.380
and Mark's mission,
it's one and two.

3419
03:33:15.381 --> 03:33:20.381
It's the same series and those books I get more

3420
03:33:22.520 --> 03:33:27.520
incredible heartfelt feedback on those two books then I could have ever

3421
03:33:30.680 --> 03:33:31.513
imagined.

3422
03:33:31.640 --> 03:33:36.640
And it's awesome because kids can relate to the books and it is great for the

3423
03:33:38.010 --> 03:33:42.090
<v 4>kids and it's great for the parents too.
And I get parents that just say,</v>

3424
03:33:42.091 --> 03:33:44.580
this is making me a better parent because it's all just a big,

3425
03:33:44.790 --> 03:33:48.150
it's all just a covered move,
right?
I'm giving you this information here.

3426
03:33:48.270 --> 03:33:51.090
You get to flank your kid because your kids aren't going to listen to you.

3427
03:33:51.210 --> 03:33:54.360
Not 100% they'll listen to a little bit,
but they'll listen to someone that they,

3428
03:33:54.480 --> 03:33:54.930
some,

3429
03:33:54.930 --> 03:33:59.910
some other person that seems like kind of tough that they want to listen to.

3430
03:33:59.911 --> 03:34:03.510
Uncle Jake,
uncle Jake starts telling them what to do and they're down.

3431
03:34:03.600 --> 03:34:05.700
Totally dumb.
And Yeah,

3432
03:34:05.760 --> 03:34:10.760
so the warrior kid books one and two obviously get one first because it's a,

3433
03:34:11.730 --> 03:34:14.480
it's a story and it kind of continues and you need to grow and it's gonna

3434
03:34:14.500 --> 03:34:16.380
continue to grow.
We're going to see this,

3435
03:34:16.560 --> 03:34:21.420
we're going to see young mark all the way through through high school.
Right.

3436
03:34:22.170 --> 03:34:25.680
And Yeah.
So those books will help kids get on the path,

3437
03:34:25.770 --> 03:34:27.510
teach them about discipline,
to teach them about hard work,

3438
03:34:27.511 --> 03:34:29.400
teach them about eating right,
teach them about study habits,

3439
03:34:29.401 --> 03:34:30.600
teach them about taking responsibility.

3440
03:34:30.601 --> 03:34:33.630
It's like everything that a kid needs to know to be quite honest.

3441
03:34:33.631 --> 03:34:37.890
Where the red this is.
And this is kind of mean I guess in a way.

3442
03:34:38.340 --> 03:34:43.340
So I've worried kid to mark the mission on repeat in the household helps that

3443
03:34:46.140 --> 03:34:48.030
for my daughter's kindergarten,

3444
03:34:48.300 --> 03:34:51.420
they suggest like all these things that you should do every day and you can kind

3445
03:34:51.421 --> 03:34:55.170
of choose one and one is reading.
No,
there you go for a certain amount of time.

3446
03:34:55.171 --> 03:34:59.250
So I just read one chapter every single night,
every single night as punishment.

3447
03:34:59.400 --> 03:35:03.870
I won't though,
which is v pretty rare.
That's pretty awesome though.
Yeah.

3448
03:35:04.980 --> 03:35:08.400
All threaten.
Hey,
nope chapter tonight.
Ooh.
She scrambles to

3449
03:35:10.560 --> 03:35:14.820
fall in line.
Anyway.
Um,
so the good thing about having it on repeat,

3450
03:35:14.821 --> 03:35:16.170
cause obviously we finished or whatever.

3451
03:35:16.171 --> 03:35:20.010
I'm on round two like towards the end of the book and she just knows,

3452
03:35:20.040 --> 03:35:24.690
she knows that the answers now,
she's still excited about it.
But yeah,
because,

3453
03:35:24.700 --> 03:35:28.110
well now she knows.
So it's all familiar,
you know,
so she kind of knows.

3454
03:35:28.140 --> 03:35:32.660
It's almost like now she's,
I think she's,
that's amazing.
Yeah.

3455
03:35:32.720 --> 03:35:33.553
That's amazing.

3456
03:35:33.870 --> 03:35:37.620
So that's where the warrior kid and Mark Smith's get it for your kids.

3457
03:35:37.800 --> 03:35:41.340
Get it free.
Your neighbor's kids.
Get it for your kids across the streets kids.

3458
03:35:41.460 --> 03:35:45.240
Oh,
I'm sorry.
Cause why not just help kids out?
Yeah.
And it does help.

3459
03:35:45.241 --> 03:35:48.240
What I'm what I was about to say about,
and I feel bad because one night,

3460
03:35:48.270 --> 03:35:53.010
this was like two nights ago,
um,
she got this new Unicorn Book Kids Book.

3461
03:35:53.200 --> 03:35:55.770
I don't know where she got it from school or something like this.
Oh yeah.

3462
03:35:55.771 --> 03:35:58.260
From their library,
whatever,
you know,
borrow the book.

3463
03:35:58.350 --> 03:36:01.530
Cause I had a new unicorn book.
Probably read that thing.
The thing is so lame.

3464
03:36:01.800 --> 03:36:03.870
It's a kindergarten level books by the way.

3465
03:36:04.740 --> 03:36:08.490
And so I'm reading it and I'm thinking this thing is lame.
I'm looking at her,

3466
03:36:08.491 --> 03:36:11.160
she's over there playing with Lego's while I'm reading and express.

3467
03:36:11.161 --> 03:36:13.480
She disengaged.
So quit.
It's some that just yet just,

3468
03:36:13.500 --> 03:36:18.350
she was just off that getting the word kid books back all day long.
Uh,

3469
03:36:18.420 --> 03:36:21.150
discipline equals freedom field manual.
This was cool at the muster.

3470
03:36:21.151 --> 03:36:24.570
A lot of people,
this,
this book definitely,

3471
03:36:24.660 --> 03:36:28.740
definitely hit people.
Hard.
Discipline equals freedom field manual.

3472
03:36:28.950 --> 03:36:32.430
So that book is a good,
you know what?
This book's going to be good for Christmas.

3473
03:36:33.090 --> 03:36:36.430
I know it's only what?
Thanksgiving,
Halloween.

3474
03:36:36.460 --> 03:36:39.820
<v 0>Halloween.
Yeah,
but this book,
Christmas time,</v>

3475
03:36:40.090 --> 03:36:44.260
this is the book you get for the the person,
you know who you need it for.

3476
03:36:44.520 --> 03:36:46.780
The person that needs to get a little a little help getting on the path.

3477
03:36:47.080 --> 03:36:50.920
So people read page a day,
two pages a day.
I read it,

3478
03:36:51.670 --> 03:36:56.260
I wrote it and I read it because it keeps you on the path.

3479
03:36:56.500 --> 03:36:58.390
So this one it goes freedom field manual.

3480
03:36:58.600 --> 03:37:00.310
Then you've got of course extreme ownership,

3481
03:37:01.570 --> 03:37:03.340
which I wrote with my brother Leif Babin,

3482
03:37:03.670 --> 03:37:08.620
which is just universally kind of become an accepted as a,
as a,

3483
03:37:08.860 --> 03:37:11.260
as a book that you need to read as a leader.

3484
03:37:11.680 --> 03:37:14.920
And that's followed up by the dichotomy of leadership,
which just came out,

3485
03:37:15.790 --> 03:37:18.850
both those books,
New York Times will sellers,
both those books,
number one,

3486
03:37:18.851 --> 03:37:22.430
Wall Street Journal,
bestsellers,
both those books continuing to be almost less.

3487
03:37:22.510 --> 03:37:25.930
Why?
Because that's not through the big advertising campaign.

3488
03:37:26.590 --> 03:37:28.030
That's just through word of mouth.

3489
03:37:28.150 --> 03:37:30.850
People get it for themselves and they get it for their teammate,

3490
03:37:30.851 --> 03:37:33.490
then they get it up the chain of command down in the chain of command.
Get your,

3491
03:37:33.520 --> 03:37:38.110
get your,
uh,
get your team in the game with the dichotomy of leadership and,

3492
03:37:38.111 --> 03:37:42.070
and extreme ownership.
And then we got Mike and the dragons,

3493
03:37:42.550 --> 03:37:47.200
which comes out in November.
So here's what it's about.
Mikey young kid,

3494
03:37:47.500 --> 03:37:50.860
scared,
scared of everything,
finds a book.

3495
03:37:51.580 --> 03:37:55.210
The book that he finds,
it's called the dragon prince.

3496
03:37:55.840 --> 03:37:58.660
And he scared to read it because there's pictures of scary dragons in it.

3497
03:37:58.661 --> 03:38:01.510
But then he gets the courage to read it because he sees a little boy in there

3498
03:38:01.511 --> 03:38:06.220
too,
that kind of looks like he knows what's going on.
So he sees that little boy,

3499
03:38:06.221 --> 03:38:07.054
he goes,
I'm gonna read it.

3500
03:38:07.810 --> 03:38:11.890
So he reads the book and in the book the Dragon Prince,

3501
03:38:12.220 --> 03:38:13.840
there's the king,
his dad,

3502
03:38:14.380 --> 03:38:19.380
and the boy is now the only one that will defend the kingdom from the dragons

3503
03:38:20.531 --> 03:38:22.570
that are over the hill in the dragon cave.

3504
03:38:23.020 --> 03:38:26.670
And the boy is scared because he's only seven years old and just know what he's

3505
03:38:26.671 --> 03:38:30.490
gonna do.
It goes and finds his father's war chest,
pulls out the shield,

3506
03:38:30.491 --> 03:38:33.730
pulls out the sword,
they're too big for him,
and now he's even more scared.

3507
03:38:33.731 --> 03:38:38.731
But then he sees a note in the bottom of the war chest and he picks up the note

3508
03:38:41.740 --> 03:38:46.360
and here's what it says after he finds this note,
it says to my son,

3509
03:38:47.890 --> 03:38:51.640
if you are reading this now,
it means I am gone.

3510
03:38:51.670 --> 03:38:56.080
And you are the one that must carry on our kingdom is now what you must save.

3511
03:38:56.081 --> 03:38:58.660
And to do that,
you have to be brave.

3512
03:39:00.160 --> 03:39:01.960
I know that you think you don't know what to do,

3513
03:39:02.140 --> 03:39:05.530
but remember that I was once a little boy too.

3514
03:39:06.310 --> 03:39:10.570
I was also small and had fear in my heart and I didn't even know where to start.

3515
03:39:10.750 --> 03:39:15.040
I couldn't imagine going over the hill to face the dragons that wanted to kill.

3516
03:39:15.400 --> 03:39:16.810
But don't worry son,

3517
03:39:17.080 --> 03:39:21.670
you will be just fine if you can just keep these things in your mind.

3518
03:39:22.670 --> 03:39:27.130
And then he goes on to explain to him how he can overcome his fear of the

3519
03:39:27.131 --> 03:39:31.390
dragons.
And that's what this does.

3520
03:39:31.660 --> 03:39:35.540
The prince does,
the prince stands up to his fears and faces the dragons.

3521
03:39:36.470 --> 03:39:41.470
And then the boy Mikey learns from the lesson.

3522
03:39:42.050 --> 03:39:46.580
And you know,
we have to remember that we all have dragons to fight.

3523
03:39:46.640 --> 03:39:50.260
So when also remember that this book is coming out on Jocko publishing.
Hmm.

3524
03:39:50.600 --> 03:39:51.433
Why is that?

3525
03:39:51.470 --> 03:39:55.310
The big publishers couldn't get it out in time for kids to have it for
Christmas.

3526
03:39:55.311 --> 03:39:58.220
And that's what I,
once I had the book in my mind,

3527
03:39:58.940 --> 03:40:03.940
I wanted kids to have it by Christmas and the big publishers couldn't make it

3528
03:40:04.671 --> 03:40:08.090
happen because they're big,
they're big,
you know,
they got a lot of moving pieces.

3529
03:40:08.510 --> 03:40:12.260
We're nimble over here,
you know,
we're nimble.
So

3530
03:40:13.760 --> 03:40:15.790
since they couldn't get it out in time,
I had to kind of like,

3531
03:40:15.800 --> 03:40:17.840
they're a big dragon.
That's what they are true.

3532
03:40:18.200 --> 03:40:22.610
And so I had to kind of like stand up to the dragons and we can stand up to the

3533
03:40:22.611 --> 03:40:26.300
dragons in our own right with this,
with this book.

3534
03:40:26.330 --> 03:40:30.860
So if you want to help fight the dragons then grab a sword or at least grab a

3535
03:40:30.861 --> 03:40:33.640
copy and together we'll slay the dragons coming.

3536
03:40:34.780 --> 03:40:38.120
Also we got to have Salon Front leadership consultancy.
That's what we do.

3537
03:40:38.180 --> 03:40:41.150
We solve problems through leadership.
It's me,

3538
03:40:41.240 --> 03:40:44.510
it's the leaf is JP,
Dave Flynn,

3539
03:40:44.870 --> 03:40:47.540
Mike Cirelli and Mike Bye Mama.

3540
03:40:48.800 --> 03:40:51.680
Don't call a speaking agency to get us,
we won't do it.

3541
03:40:52.640 --> 03:40:56.750
Email echelon front or check the website echelon front.com or you can email

3542
03:40:56.751 --> 03:41:01.700
info@echelonfront.com the muster.
We just got done with the monster.
Good show,

3543
03:41:01.790 --> 03:41:05.360
good show.
It's awesome.
Awesome to be up there.

3544
03:41:05.630 --> 03:41:10.160
Awesome to meet all these people coming from all over the world.

3545
03:41:10.520 --> 03:41:14.290
South Africa,
New Zealand.
Right.

3546
03:41:14.810 --> 03:41:18.800
It's interesting this one woman came from New Zealand and like it didn't get a

3547
03:41:18.801 --> 03:41:19.221
shout out.

3548
03:41:19.221 --> 03:41:22.580
Lafe was kind of naming some of the countries where people from from and I don't

3549
03:41:22.581 --> 03:41:24.680
think,
well we didn't have it on the list or whatever.

3550
03:41:24.800 --> 03:41:27.770
We should have done a better job of screening it.
But she came up,
she was like,

3551
03:41:27.771 --> 03:41:31.460
I'm from New Zealand and I was like,
she goes,
I was like,
all that's awesome.

3552
03:41:31.461 --> 03:41:33.740
She goes,
you guys didn't say it.
I was like,
ah.

3553
03:41:34.190 --> 03:41:39.080
Now New Zealand was represented and it strongly,
and I signed a book.

3554
03:41:39.380 --> 03:41:41.420
She had to go,
she had to do a little like,

3555
03:41:41.570 --> 03:41:44.510
I think she did a coin flip to figure out who gets to go to the muster,

3556
03:41:44.900 --> 03:41:49.580
her husband she wants,
so I signed books for him.
So yeah,

3557
03:41:49.581 --> 03:41:51.560
come to the monster and the next one,

3558
03:41:51.620 --> 03:41:56.030
it just want be one in Chicago in the spring and one in Denver in the fall.

3559
03:41:56.330 --> 03:42:01.160
So it's looking like Australia in the winter,
so keep that on the down low.

3560
03:42:03.260 --> 03:42:07.400
But every,
every monster we've done is sold out and these are gonna sell out too.

3561
03:42:07.520 --> 03:42:12.200
So check extreme ownership.com if you want to get into that game.
Of course.

3562
03:42:12.201 --> 03:42:17.000
Now we also have EIF,
Overwatch,
a big subject.
Lots of people.

3563
03:42:17.170 --> 03:42:20.150
It's,
it's the war on the war for talent.
That's what it is.

3564
03:42:20.660 --> 03:42:24.890
Everyone needs good.
What if you have a problem in your world?

3565
03:42:24.950 --> 03:42:26.510
What's going to solve that problem?
Good leadership.

3566
03:42:26.570 --> 03:42:28.010
Where do you get good leaders from?
Well,

3567
03:42:28.011 --> 03:42:31.070
what we figured out is we get good leadership from the military,

3568
03:42:31.140 --> 03:42:36.140
so we got special operations and combat aviators that are ready to go out and do

3569
03:42:37.291 --> 03:42:41.130
work and we're putting them into companies that need leaders.

3570
03:42:41.700 --> 03:42:46.700
So if you've got a company or if you're a vet SPEC ops or or combat aviation,

3571
03:42:47.190 --> 03:42:51.600
go to eff Overwatch and you can get in the game there.

3572
03:42:53.080 --> 03:42:56.160
And if you want to continue this conversation that we're kind of having right

3573
03:42:56.161 --> 03:43:00.270
now,
you will spend kind of a long conversation,
but if you want to keep it going,

3574
03:43:00.750 --> 03:43:05.670
you can find us on the interwebs,
on Twitter,
on Instagram,
and on Facebook.

3575
03:43:06.450 --> 03:43:09.090
Keep Echo is at echo.

3576
03:43:09.091 --> 03:43:14.091
Charles and I am at jockowillink and thanks to all of you for making this

3577
03:43:14.761 --> 03:43:17.790
podcast possible by all of you.
I mean,
first of all,

3578
03:43:17.791 --> 03:43:22.791
the military who protects our way of life and who sacrifice so much for our

3579
03:43:25.080 --> 03:43:29.070
freedom and our security and here at home,
police,

3580
03:43:29.640 --> 03:43:34.320
law enforcement,
firefighters,
paramedics,
key,
mts,
correctional officer's border,

3581
03:43:34.321 --> 03:43:38.130
patrol's first responders.
You know who you are.
Those of you in uniform.

3582
03:43:38.131 --> 03:43:43.131
Thank you for your service in protecting us here at home and everyone that

3583
03:43:44.641 --> 03:43:45.474
listens

3584
03:43:46.800 --> 03:43:50.970
wherever you are in whatever it is that you do.
Teachers,

3585
03:43:51.240 --> 03:43:55.290
investment bankers,
plumbers,
engineers,
electricians,

3586
03:43:55.291 --> 03:44:00.291
doctors and nurses and builders and bricklayers and everyone else that is out

3587
03:44:00.331 --> 03:44:04.170
there making their way.
Like I said earlier,

3588
03:44:04.200 --> 03:44:06.120
it can get hard sometimes.

3589
03:44:08.540 --> 03:44:10.070
That's the way life is.

3590
03:44:10.430 --> 03:44:15.140
And sometimes you can actually hear life laughing at you sometimes.

3591
03:44:16.930 --> 03:44:17.763
<v 1>Okay.</v>

3592
03:44:17.890 --> 03:44:19.060
<v 0>But I say don't let it.</v>

3593
03:44:19.270 --> 03:44:24.270
It's like when the Chinese guards conducted a mock execution on Colonel

3594
03:44:24.611 --> 03:44:28.420
Richardson and the other prisoners,
prisoners that he was there with,

3595
03:44:28.870 --> 03:44:32.530
and then the good the guards,
they stood there and they weren't laughing.

3596
03:44:33.900 --> 03:44:34.690
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

3597
03:44:34.690 --> 03:44:38.560
<v 0>they were laughing at these terrified prisoners and the colonel,</v>

3598
03:44:38.561 --> 03:44:42.010
he didn't like that at the time to master sergeant.
He didn't like that.

3599
03:44:42.070 --> 03:44:44.980
So he yelled,
he yelled,
get up.

3600
03:44:47.050 --> 03:44:50.140
Don't let them laugh at you.
Get up.

3601
03:44:54.120 --> 03:44:59.120
And I recommend that if you feel like the world is laughing at you,

3602
03:44:59.850 --> 03:45:02.280
you do the same.
You get up.

3603
03:45:03.600 --> 03:45:04.433
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

3604
03:45:04.450 --> 03:45:09.370
<v 0>And get after it.
And until next time,</v>

3605
03:45:10.420 --> 03:45:14.370
this is echo and Jocko out.
