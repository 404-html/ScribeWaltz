00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:02.380
And you know,
this,
this last question,

2
00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:07.540
it's not really a question.
What would it look?

3
00:00:07.541 --> 00:00:12.541
I get a lot of awesome emails and I get emails from people that have completely

4
00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:19.720
turned
their lives around.
They've,
they've lost weight.

5
00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:23.080
If they needed to lose weight or they've gained weight because they needed to

6
00:00:23.081 --> 00:00:28.081
gain weight or they've gotten promoted or they've become a better parent or they

7
00:00:29.201 --> 00:00:32.170
become a better spouse or they become a better kid.
Yeah,

8
00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:34.220
<v 1>yeah.</v>

9
00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:39.220
<v 0>And I get emails from people that have quit their addictions or they've,</v>

10
00:00:39.291 --> 00:00:43.160
or they've overcome their fear and I say,
what?

11
00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:48.520
I get letters and packages and notes about all this kind of stuff.

12
00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:50.960
Then it's awesome.
I get,

13
00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:56.050
I get people send me books for the podcast and pictures and drawings and,

14
00:00:58.080 --> 00:00:58.550
and,

15
00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:03.550
and military memorabilia or unit patches and coins from police departments and

16
00:01:07.041 --> 00:01:10.400
fire departments and,
and military units.
It's just,

17
00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:16.020
it's awesome.
And,
and I,
um,

18
00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:20.110
I'm so thankful for all that feedback

19
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.680
and it,
it drives me bad feedback that I get,

20
00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:32.070
drives me to work hard and keep pushing to do this to the best of my ability and

21
00:01:35.711 --> 00:01:36.670
try and get better at it.

22
00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:43.790
But
you know,
I,

23
00:01:43.791 --> 00:01:48.791
I hear from people that have used the podcast and the discipline and the,

24
00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:50.190
the,

25
00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:55.190
the mindset of looking at things that are problematic as being good.

26
00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.670
I hear from people that have used those things to overcome,

27
00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:08.180
you know,
dark patches yeah.
In their lives.
No,

28
00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:13.210
whether it's depression or anxiety or even like full fledged despair.

29
00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:19.900
And again,
when you hear from people that are turned that corner,

30
00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.950
that's just incredibly rewarding

31
00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:27.270
to know that there's,
you know,

32
00:02:27.271 --> 00:02:30.540
there's people out there that are really changing for the better and turning

33
00:02:30.541 --> 00:02:34.140
their lives from negative

34
00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:36.793
to positive.

35
00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:41.490
It's unbelievably rewarding.

36
00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:46.750
But I also get

37
00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:52.980
some other emails and I get some other messages

38
00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:58.080
from people that haven't been able

39
00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:04.960
to dig out of that hole to overcome that,

40
00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:07.300
that despair.

41
00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:13.710
I hear from people sometimes that fuel Vitters nowhere,

42
00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:15.720
nowhere else to go.
There's no way out.

43
00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:19.080
And they don't have any more options

44
00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:26.570
and they are considering

45
00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:33.470
taking the only way out that they can see.

46
00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:35.900
And that is they want to take their own life.

47
00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:40.863
<v 1>Okay.</v>

48
00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:43.023
<v 0>And</v>

49
00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:50.820
to anybody out there that's in that place,

50
00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:54.883
<v 1>you know,</v>

51
00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:02.170
<v 0>I don't really know what exactly to tell you,</v>

52
00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:09.410
but I can kind of tell you what I think.

53
00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:15.270
I think.
No,

54
00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:20.250
I think,
no,

55
00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:25.490
I think don't save that last bullet for yourself.

56
00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:28.730
Don't save it for yourself.

57
00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:33.760
You lock and load that last bullet and you shoot it at your enemy.

58
00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:40.890
And when you're out of bullets,
get out your knife and attack with that.

59
00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:45.310
And if you lose your knife,

60
00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:50.970
grab your enemy by the fruit and you keep fighting

61
00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:58.300
and you keep fighting and you keep fighting and you keep fighting no matter

62
00:04:58.910 --> 00:04:59.743
what.

63
00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:08.440
And you never quit.
Never,

64
00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:10.293
never

65
00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:11.443
<v 1>quit.</v>

66
00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:19.240
<v 0>And if you feel like your wife isn't a place where you can't get any lower</v>

67
00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:26.710
and you don't think you can find any way out,

68
00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:29.473
<v 1>good</v>

69
00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:36.690
<v 0>cause that means the ultimate challenge is ahead of you.</v>

70
00:05:36.691 --> 00:05:38.460
It means you can only go up.

71
00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:47.360
And it also means that things are going to be tough.

72
00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:54.390
Things are going to be tougher than anything you can imagine,

73
00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:58.790
but that storm you're in from,

74
00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:00.530
from your perspective,

75
00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:07.580
it seems like that storm is enveloping the whole world,

76
00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:14.000
but I'm telling you,
it is not

77
00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:20.390
the storm that urine.

78
00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:24.980
It is hard to see out of that storm.
It's hard to see past it.

79
00:06:24.981 --> 00:06:28.430
It seems like the storm,
it seems like the storm is everything,

80
00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:36.010
but the storm is not everything

81
00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:41.690
Andy alone last forever.

82
00:06:46.690 --> 00:06:51.690
You can get out of the storm and you will get out of the storm,

83
00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:54.760
and when you get out,

84
00:06:59.230 --> 00:07:00.400
you're going to see this sauna.

85
00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:02.853
<v 1>Okay,</v>

86
00:07:07.530 --> 00:07:10.710
<v 0>but right now you're being tried.</v>

87
00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:14.360
You're being forge.

88
00:07:14.570 --> 00:07:19.570
You're being tested by fire and by pain.

89
00:07:24.730 --> 00:07:25.690
That's the test.

90
00:07:30.590 --> 00:07:31.760
Don't fail the test.

91
00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:39.760
Don't fail the test.
Don't give in.
Don't quit.

92
00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:44.113
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

93
00:07:45.050 --> 00:07:48.930
<v 0>Don't ever quit.
Fight on</v>

94
00:07:50.790 --> 00:07:51.900
fight through the storm.

95
00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:58.040
Fight through the pain and come out the other side.

96
00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:01.010
Stronger and tougher

97
00:08:02.110 --> 00:08:02.980
<v 1>and better.</v>

98
00:08:08.690 --> 00:08:09.940
A fighter,

99
00:08:13.420 --> 00:08:14.590
<v 0>a survivor,</v>

100
00:08:17.820 --> 00:08:18.653
<v 1>oh,
winner.</v>

101
00:08:24.020 --> 00:08:25.130
<v 0>Victorious</v>

102
00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:29.393
and

103
00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:33.700
free from that storm.

104
00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:40.320
Free from the darkness.

105
00:08:46.180 --> 00:08:46.600
<v 1>Free.</v>
