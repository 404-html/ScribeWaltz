This is Jocko podcast number one 14 with Echo Charles and me,

2
00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:09.440
Jocko Willink.
Good Evening Echo.
Good evening.

3
00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:15.670
And tonight we have a guest on the podcast for the fourth time.

4
00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:20.480
The fourth appearance,

5
00:00:20.481 --> 00:00:25.481
which is no surprise really because this is a guy that I went to war with,

6
00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:31.760
started a business with,
wrote a book with.

7
00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:38.030
I actually watched him get married and have kids and buy houses and go from a,

8
00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.890
let's say a wild single man going to live a Friday night.

9
00:00:49.741 --> 00:00:51.900
Like it was his last night ever

10
00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:59.090
to a guy with a diaper in one hand and a bag of Cheddar bunnies in the other

11
00:01:00.391 --> 00:01:04.560
hands trying to tame his son,

12
00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.970
who at one years old was like a hardheaded borderline psychotic version of

13
00:01:14.251 --> 00:01:15.240
himself.

14
00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:24.170
And I also saw this guy in much harsher environments and in some of the most

15
00:01:25.111 --> 00:01:30.111
challenging situations I saw him bear the incredibly heavy weight of leading men

16
00:01:32.851 --> 00:01:33.684
in combat

17
00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:40.670
and also the crushing weight of losing some of those men.

18
00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:49.080
I still see that weight on his shoulders.

19
00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:53.060
Can I see it in his eyes?

20
00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:57.830
And I wish I could take some of it away.

21
00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:01.123
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

22
00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:06.130
<v 0>but I can't,
they end</v>

23
00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:08.920
as we learn.

24
00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:10.620
<v 1>Okay.</v>

25
00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:14.400
<v 0>In the seal teams we don't complain.</v>

26
00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.550
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

27
00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:19.190
<v 0>We shoulder our share</v>

28
00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:21.023
<v 1>of the weight,</v>

29
00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:27.060
<v 0>which shoulder our share of the burden and we drive on.</v>

30
00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:30.433
<v 1>Okay.</v>

31
00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:31.643
<v 0>And I've</v>

32
00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:36.960
seen him stand up when I needed him to stand up

33
00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:44.120
when what I was asking for was more than I could have asked or should have

34
00:02:46.771 --> 00:02:48.300
expected from anyone.

35
00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:56.730
And I watched him time and time and time again move out,

36
00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:03.120
<v 2>move out into the darkness,</v>

37
00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:07.070
toward the unknown,
toward the violence,

38
00:03:07.071 --> 00:03:11.120
toward the enemy who's mission was

39
00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:15.530
to Maine or to kill him

40
00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:19.523
and his men.

41
00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:26.500
But he went and he went every time and he went without fail

42
00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:31.270
and his name is Leif Babin.

43
00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:37.740
And if you want a more thorough background of leaf,

44
00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:41.110
you can listen to the other times that he's been on this podcast.

45
00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:46.580
He was on number 11 number 34 number 65 you should listen to those first before

46
00:03:46.901 --> 00:03:49.990
you listen to this one.
You can also read the book that we wrote.

47
00:03:49.991 --> 00:03:50.950
It's called extreme ownership.

48
00:03:50.951 --> 00:03:54.430
It's about our experiences in combat and the leadership lessons we learned
there.

49
00:03:54.431 --> 00:03:56.170
But for now,

50
00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:00.530
here we are once again in life.

51
00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:04.840
Welcome back to the show.
Thanks for having me on.

52
00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:08.690
And we had a couple of different options on what we were going to do this time

53
00:04:08.691 --> 00:04:11.380
around and tweeted out,
you know,

54
00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:16.420
if anybody has any questions and we got a lot of questions so I know I can

55
00:04:16.491 --> 00:04:17.600
answer questions.

56
00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:23.350
We'll just say in a really in a very in depth manner from time to time and we

57
00:04:25.251 --> 00:04:28.250
got a lot of questions.
So I,
I,
you know,
we,

58
00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:32.160
we just took down a bunch of the questions and I'll read through some of them

59
00:04:32.161 --> 00:04:34.250
and we'll try and burn through a bunch of these questions that we got from

60
00:04:34.251 --> 00:04:38.450
everybody.
Let's get some ready.
Get some,
like I said,

61
00:04:38.451 --> 00:04:39.660
life is always ready to get Sophie,

62
00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:43.140
which is static stand buddy gets on standby to yes for,

63
00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:45.350
for people that didn't know,
don't know what that means.

64
00:04:45.351 --> 00:04:46.850
And we often put that out on social media.

65
00:04:46.851 --> 00:04:50.460
I don't think people recognize what that actually means.
So it's like we,

66
00:04:50.461 --> 00:04:54.230
we knew we'd say this all the time in combat or in training scenarios when you

67
00:04:54.231 --> 00:04:57.230
knew that,
I mean it was about to go down bullets,

68
00:04:57.231 --> 00:04:58.400
we're going to be flying around,

69
00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:02.360
exposure going to be going off and you hear someone very clearly over the radio

70
00:05:02.361 --> 00:05:06.110
just in a real combo is come up and be like stand by.
It gets them.

71
00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:10.610
Yeah.
So get a chuckle out of that every time.

72
00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:15.170
I always get a chuckle out of that one.
Yeah,
that's a,
that's a,

73
00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:18.250
it's a true statement though,
right?
You know,
you're,

74
00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:21.880
but when you could say it in that manner,
you know,
when you should be like,
Yo,

75
00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:25.810
let's do that.
Or in the job and,
and people were like stand by to get some,
yeah,

76
00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:27.980
it's pretty awesome.

77
00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:32.980
I was on my first deployment and we were driving driving south from Baghdad and

78
00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:40.970
we got ambushed and we were like out for like a five or six vehicle convoy and

79
00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:43.690
the ambush hit the tail end.
I wasn't,

80
00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:46.140
I was in the number two vehicle as normal for,
you know,

81
00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:50.690
for platoon commander at the time.
I'm in the number two vehicle,

82
00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:54.980
the tail end of the ambush gets ambushed or tail,

83
00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.320
the convoy gets camp ambushed.
And

84
00:05:58.220 --> 00:05:59.270
<v 0>what I mean it's very clear,</v>

85
00:05:59.271 --> 00:06:02.990
it's RPGs are going over the convoy and explosions and machine gun fire.

86
00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:08.480
And it's really obvious we're getting ambushed and what we're on a highway and

87
00:06:08.991 --> 00:06:12.590
we're moving fast.
So we,
you know,
it's,
you know,
I was like a push through,

88
00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:14.840
you know what I mean?
Like we didn't stop at all,
didn't even hesitate.

89
00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:19.290
And then we continued down the road and I asked for the um,
you know,

90
00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:21.920
like UPC count from the ribs up count.
And so it was,
you know,

91
00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:24.320
I hear like Google six is up,

92
00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:28.790
we will call five is up and the vehicle for us up and it gets the front and I'm

93
00:06:28.791 --> 00:06:31.880
like,
Roger,
we're up,
keep it rolling.
And then another,

94
00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:37.040
maybe another minute goes by.
And My platoon chief,

95
00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:38.060
great guy,

96
00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:41.450
he's in the back vehicle rear in the rear of vehicles cause that's how you
break,

97
00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:45.020
you know,
break it up.
So if something happens,
he's in controller and,

98
00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:50.120
and he comes up in the radio and he's like,
he's like,
Hey sir,

99
00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:53.060
just you just want to let you tell me.
We got ambushed her back here.

100
00:06:53.061 --> 00:06:55.970
Did you know that?
And I go like this,
Roger,

101
00:06:57.650 --> 00:07:01.400
we got back.
We had a good laugh about that one but uh,
it was pretty good times.

102
00:07:01.670 --> 00:07:05.090
So awesome.
Yeah.
All right,

103
00:07:06.290 --> 00:07:07.250
get into some questions.

104
00:07:07.970 --> 00:07:10.670
This is a question that actually came very similar questions that I had when it,

105
00:07:10.671 --> 00:07:14.180
when it had Tony on.
And most of these questions,

106
00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:16.790
cause I said these questions are for life coming on the podcast and most of them

107
00:07:16.791 --> 00:07:20.450
are directed at you and I'll,
I'll,
I'll chime in or whatever if I feel the need.

108
00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:24.560
But you like that.
So here we go.
First and one life.

109
00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:29.270
How often did you disagree with Jocko was commands and how many times did you

110
00:07:29.271 --> 00:07:34.271
actually let them know also how did your handle either situation?

111
00:07:35.930 --> 00:07:36.763
So there you go.

112
00:07:38.090 --> 00:07:42.870
<v 3>I disagree with Jocko every minute.
We actually,
we had a,</v>

113
00:07:43.610 --> 00:07:46.310
it's a great question and look,
Jack and I are different people.

114
00:07:46.311 --> 00:07:49.880
We have different views of the world.
We have,
uh,
there were,

115
00:07:49.881 --> 00:07:52.550
there were times when his job was,

116
00:07:53.090 --> 00:07:55.660
your job was strategic and you're looking at the bigger strategic picture.

117
00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:57.710
My job was tactical.
I'm looking at the tactical picture.

118
00:07:57.890 --> 00:08:01.790
Sometimes you can make a tactical decision that could impact the strategic

119
00:08:01.791 --> 00:08:02.740
mission and ever.

120
00:08:02.870 --> 00:08:05.660
It was very rare though that we ever had any kind of disagreement on those

121
00:08:05.661 --> 00:08:09.580
things.
Uh,
I think,
um,
you know,
there were,

122
00:08:09.581 --> 00:08:12.540
there are a number of times that when,
uh,
what,

123
00:08:12.541 --> 00:08:15.620
what I always liked about Jocko and I think people look at you and think,
oh,

124
00:08:15.621 --> 00:08:19.000
he's just big intimidating guide at our member.
Uh,

125
00:08:19.070 --> 00:08:21.300
our commanding officer actually,
um,

126
00:08:21.460 --> 00:08:24.980
we were talking to them and of course he loved our task unit and he was like,

127
00:08:24.981 --> 00:08:27.750
yeah,
you guys Bruce.
He was like,
he was talking to me and,

128
00:08:27.751 --> 00:08:32.090
and a Delta platoon commander and uh,
and said,
you guys,

129
00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:34.580
you got to do a jock who says,
oh,
he's,
he'll choke you out.

130
00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:36.710
And we were kind of laughing about that cause we were,

131
00:08:36.711 --> 00:08:38.450
we were training Jujitsu every morning.
I'm like,
man,

132
00:08:38.451 --> 00:08:41.300
I've been choked out by Jaco hundreds of times.
It's not even a threat anymore.

133
00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:44.450
But uh,
it was,
it was never,

134
00:08:44.540 --> 00:08:49.540
we never did what you said because it was fear or intimidation or like we have

135
00:08:49.581 --> 00:08:50.840
to do what he says because he's in charge.

136
00:08:51.140 --> 00:08:54.410
What I always loved about you and your leadership was that I knew that I could

137
00:08:54.411 --> 00:08:57.120
push back on stuff and you're going to listen to me.
And it was uh,

138
00:08:57.121 --> 00:08:59.850
it was engineering interesting for me to see that as,
you know,

139
00:08:59.851 --> 00:09:02.850
we built a relationship.
I could,
I could come in and be like,
Hey,

140
00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:07.040
I think we ought to do this.
And,
and,
and very rarely would you are,

141
00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:10.650
you would never say like,
no,
do it this way cause it's my way.
But even very,

142
00:09:10.651 --> 00:09:13.590
very rarely would you would you say sometimes you might bet,
well,

143
00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:15.840
we want to go in this direction and here's why we want to do this.

144
00:09:16.140 --> 00:09:19.980
But most of the time you would actually just say,
hey,
we'll talk me through that.

145
00:09:20.610 --> 00:09:22.290
Okay,
how's that going to work?

146
00:09:22.380 --> 00:09:25.730
And you would give me the opportunity and others in the,

147
00:09:25.731 --> 00:09:29.580
between the opportunity to come up with a plan and kind of analyze it and look

148
00:09:29.581 --> 00:09:33.410
at it and,
and give it,
give it a shot.
And so that's,
that's where I live.

149
00:09:33.420 --> 00:09:35.460
I always loved about,
uh,
about that.

150
00:09:35.461 --> 00:09:39.000
I mean a couple of disagreements that that came up,
uh,
you know,
for,

151
00:09:39.001 --> 00:09:41.550
for me something that we talk about all the time,
you know,

152
00:09:41.551 --> 00:09:44.370
with our business echelon front and when we talking in talking to companies and

153
00:09:44.371 --> 00:09:47.760
leadership teams,
going to the workup cycle,
you know,

154
00:09:47.761 --> 00:09:50.520
we always talk about people want to hire folks and just kind of let them,

155
00:09:50.550 --> 00:09:53.280
let them run and,
and you know,
people won't say,
Hey,
give them,

156
00:09:53.580 --> 00:09:56.370
give him the opportunity to go out and succeed.
And A,

157
00:09:56.371 --> 00:09:59.670
and a lot of bosses want to kind of,
you know,
we'll just,
hey,
I'm really busy.

158
00:09:59.671 --> 00:10:02.940
Hire someone with experience,
put them,
put them in and position you kept really,

159
00:10:02.941 --> 00:10:07.200
really tight reins on us.
Uh,
and initially that was super frustrating to me.

160
00:10:07.230 --> 00:10:07.810
I mean,
I,

161
00:10:07.810 --> 00:10:11.520
I remember being in our mount training military operates urban terrain training

162
00:10:11.970 --> 00:10:13.800
for folks that don't know what that means.
We're,
we're,

163
00:10:13.801 --> 00:10:17.700
we're in the mock cinder block city and we've talked about that on the podcast

164
00:10:17.701 --> 00:10:21.800
and talk about that often here for,
for other folks at other podcasts.
But,
uh,

165
00:10:21.870 --> 00:10:24.570
that was it.
I wanted to plan these things.

166
00:10:24.571 --> 00:10:27.780
I'm the platoon commander and I want to be in charge.
I remember you saying,
Hey,

167
00:10:27.781 --> 00:10:29.820
we should do this or let's plan it this way or,

168
00:10:29.830 --> 00:10:34.830
and I remember wanting to kind of push back against that and a,
and oftentimes,

169
00:10:35.190 --> 00:10:37.860
uh,
but I recognize like as we're going along,

170
00:10:37.870 --> 00:10:42.600
you're actually training me and given me the,
the,
uh,
given me up to you,

171
00:10:42.601 --> 00:10:45.030
you've done a whole bunch of these operations that I hadn't done any of those

172
00:10:45.031 --> 00:10:49.450
operations previously.
So,
uh,
you,
you were teaching me and mentoring me and,

173
00:10:49.451 --> 00:10:52.890
and once we got to the battlefield,
you just unleash,
just have to get after it.

174
00:10:53.130 --> 00:10:57.450
And a couple of times I do remember some push back where you came up and gave me

175
00:10:57.451 --> 00:11:01.950
some direction and uh,
you know,
were,
were,
uh,
you said,
hey,

176
00:11:02.010 --> 00:11:03.300
why don't you try this or do that?

177
00:11:03.301 --> 00:11:06.100
And one of those times in particular was when I was,
you know,

178
00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:08.400
what I was trying to get,
get,
uh,

179
00:11:08.700 --> 00:11:13.020
I remember a number of times and one of them out it in our desert,
uh,
uh,

180
00:11:13.290 --> 00:11:16.410
training facility out at what be called land warfare.
And,
uh,

181
00:11:16.411 --> 00:11:20.000
I'm trying to get the platoon,
um,
to,
to,
uh,
to,

182
00:11:20.070 --> 00:11:22.710
to pull back to a position and we're trying to try on a patrol out.

183
00:11:22.711 --> 00:11:27.570
And you gave me,
um,
he,
he told me to actually stop trying to put,

184
00:11:27.660 --> 00:11:29.460
put a bunch of detailed information out of the radio,

185
00:11:29.461 --> 00:11:33.380
like Jews verbal commands do it this way.
And I,
you know,

186
00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:35.460
immediately my ego getting the way I was in,

187
00:11:35.540 --> 00:11:37.950
it was frustrating because the team wasn't doing what I want them to do.

188
00:11:38.730 --> 00:11:41.820
And that's like step number one in the frustration.

189
00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:45.270
So I team isn't doing what I wanted was so automatically my meters kind of

190
00:11:45.271 --> 00:11:48.210
starting to get pegged and like,
you know,
the rag,
no one's listening to me.

191
00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:51.600
So when Jocko comes up to give me some direction of like,
hey,

192
00:11:51.601 --> 00:11:54.040
you ought to do this,
my immediate pushback is like,
no,

193
00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:57.910
<v 0>I'm not going to do that.
You know,
I didn't say that,
but I,
I just,
I was like,</v>

194
00:11:58.120 --> 00:11:59.170
I kind of bristled a little bit.

195
00:11:59.171 --> 00:12:03.080
I remember kind of Breslin at that and I was like,
okay,
let me think about it.
Um,

196
00:12:03.340 --> 00:12:06.970
what do we,
you know,
uh,
he hasn't told me wrong before.
And I was like,

197
00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.870
let me give that a shot.
I was like,
okay,
I'll do that.
Use verbal commands,
get,

198
00:12:09.880 --> 00:12:11.120
get her by moving dude.

199
00:12:11.150 --> 00:12:13.780
And you do that over and over and over again throughout multiple training

200
00:12:13.781 --> 00:12:17.600
scenarios and then on the ballot as well.
We're,
we're,
that's what built up trust.

201
00:12:17.601 --> 00:12:20.170
So when,
when you did tell me to do some,
I was like,
I'm going to give it a shot.

202
00:12:20.171 --> 00:12:24.220
And,
and it worked.
It worked like magic.
Expand on that a little bit.

203
00:12:24.250 --> 00:12:25.210
The verbal command thing is,

204
00:12:25.211 --> 00:12:28.810
so you get guys that there's a bunch of people you know you've got,

205
00:12:28.811 --> 00:12:30.130
you've got to protect the,
we'll just take this case,

206
00:12:30.131 --> 00:12:33.640
you've got to tune of 16 guys there in various terrain features.

207
00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:36.760
One guys in a little in a little low,
uh,
a ravine,

208
00:12:36.761 --> 00:12:38.680
one guys up on a little knoll and other guys behind a stroke.

209
00:12:38.681 --> 00:12:42.670
So there's a little bit of dispersion with your troops and you want to get them

210
00:12:42.671 --> 00:12:43.390
to do something.

211
00:12:43.390 --> 00:12:45.790
You want him to get him to fall back or you want to get them to muster where you

212
00:12:45.791 --> 00:12:47.650
are and maybe the shooting stopped or whatever.

213
00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:50.590
But you want to control all these people at the same time.

214
00:12:51.010 --> 00:12:55.330
And so what you think is,
hey,
I'll just get on the radio and I'll tell everyone,

215
00:12:55.420 --> 00:12:59.350
hey everyone,
I'm back about a hundred meters back.

216
00:12:59.380 --> 00:13:02.800
There's a little piece of terrain sticking out.
There's a rock by it.

217
00:13:02.920 --> 00:13:04.000
I'm behind that rock.

218
00:13:04.001 --> 00:13:07.870
And if you guys start peeling back here to the northwest at about zero nine zero

219
00:13:07.871 --> 00:13:10.570
degrees,
that's where you're flying me.
Okay.

220
00:13:10.571 --> 00:13:14.290
So now what does that come across like on a transmission for a guy that's

221
00:13:14.410 --> 00:13:19.040
shooting them a machine gun?
He hears like grown up,
got come back.

222
00:13:20.070 --> 00:13:22.510
That's what he hears.
He doesn't hear anything.
And,
and so,

223
00:13:22.511 --> 00:13:27.340
and you've given this long,
complex direction and what you really need is,
hey,

224
00:13:27.341 --> 00:13:31.750
everyone fall back here.
Now that's what,
that's what they need to hear.

225
00:13:32.680 --> 00:13:36.390
And so then you do it.
And he realized that now we have,
uh,
uh,

226
00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:38.140
a thing in the seal teams where you pass the command.

227
00:13:38.141 --> 00:13:40.390
And so when you hear a loud verbal command,
everyone passes it.

228
00:13:40.391 --> 00:13:42.430
Now everyone heard it and now everyone comes back to your position.

229
00:13:43.060 --> 00:13:45.460
But this is the essence of the book,
extreme ownership.

230
00:13:45.490 --> 00:13:48.430
This is really the essence of simple.
Like it's simple,
clear communications.

231
00:13:48.431 --> 00:13:52.540
And that's one of those things that once you learn it and you're like,
yeah,

232
00:13:53.170 --> 00:13:55.630
if I,
if my people with my team isn't doing what I want him to do,

233
00:13:55.870 --> 00:13:58.120
not that they don't want to,
they don't even know what do you want him to do?

234
00:13:58.330 --> 00:14:00.250
Because you're giving it in such a complex way.

235
00:14:00.370 --> 00:14:04.390
I S I gave that council hundreds of times.

236
00:14:04.510 --> 00:14:06.490
Once I was running the training on the west coast.

237
00:14:06.491 --> 00:14:08.200
I gave that council a hundred times like,
hey man,

238
00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:11.740
just tell everyone a simple command right now to get them to do something.

239
00:14:11.741 --> 00:14:16.300
So that holds true.
And I'll tell you,
I'll tell you another situation where you,

240
00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:20.230
you kind of disagreed with me and we,
we,
we were working with a company,

241
00:14:20.231 --> 00:14:21.370
I'm not going to mention the company's name.

242
00:14:21.640 --> 00:14:25.160
We were working with a company and there was a,
a,
uh,
uh,

243
00:14:25.960 --> 00:14:28.570
like a mid level but somewhat senior leader.

244
00:14:29.050 --> 00:14:31.720
And you didn't like him.

245
00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:34.330
And the reason you didn't like him because he wasn't really that confident.

246
00:14:34.520 --> 00:14:37.960
He had messed some things up and his whole,

247
00:14:37.990 --> 00:14:39.700
his division was suffering a little bit.

248
00:14:40.900 --> 00:14:44.350
And you were,
you were kind of like,
hey,
Jocko,

249
00:14:44.351 --> 00:14:47.230
we should talk about getting this guy fired.
Well,
it wasn't that he was,

250
00:14:47.290 --> 00:14:50.230
it just wasn't that he was competent.
His division was suffering.

251
00:14:50.231 --> 00:14:52.190
Like they were like,
Hey,
what's the dis guy

252
00:14:52.190 --> 00:14:56.690
<v 4>is dragging us down?
This is a major issue.
Uh,
and,
uh,
and I was,</v>

253
00:14:56.810 --> 00:14:59.900
we were getting massive negative feedback that was impacting the team,

254
00:14:59.901 --> 00:15:02.640
particularly from a guy who was supposed to be,
uh,

255
00:15:03.140 --> 00:15:07.760
the knowledgeable guy that was able to groom and mentor the Junior leaders

256
00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:11.900
underneath him.
Uh,
and you know,
I thought,
man,

257
00:15:13.100 --> 00:15:16.940
why should they keep this guy?
This is that he's actually dragging the team down.

258
00:15:17.390 --> 00:15:22.080
Uh,
and you said,
well,
strategically it,
if they get rid of you,

259
00:15:22.081 --> 00:15:23.380
I think get rid of this guy.
It's going to,

260
00:15:23.450 --> 00:15:25.970
it's going to actually have some impacts.
The strategic mission,

261
00:15:25.971 --> 00:15:29.120
they're trying to do it.
Yeah.
There's the senior leaders were going to quote,

262
00:15:29.180 --> 00:15:30.950
you know,
maybe question what was going on there.

263
00:15:30.951 --> 00:15:34.070
If you remove a key leader from so strategically at that point in the company,

264
00:15:34.460 --> 00:15:38.090
that individual who was,
you know,

265
00:15:38.091 --> 00:15:42.920
again we'll just say incompetent and also online,
he had really,

266
00:15:42.980 --> 00:15:47.980
really good political and relationship connections with the,

267
00:15:49.880 --> 00:15:51.020
we'll say a parent company,

268
00:15:51.021 --> 00:15:56.021
but the people that controlled the funding and so we could get rid of this guy,

269
00:15:56.150 --> 00:15:59.030
but all of a sudden all these people that were funding this company,

270
00:15:59.240 --> 00:16:03.650
there was going to be problems.
And I was like,
Hey,
if we get rid of that guy,

271
00:16:03.651 --> 00:16:07.770
we're going to cut a lot of relationship courts.
So we,

272
00:16:07.850 --> 00:16:10.230
let's try and find a way to mitigate as much as we can do.

273
00:16:10.250 --> 00:16:14.960
And we disagreed upon it.
But basically,
you know,

274
00:16:14.990 --> 00:16:19.990
you've fundamentally got the other leader in that division to figure out how to

275
00:16:21.171 --> 00:16:25.040
work with the guy and got him trained up and then that guy took enough control

276
00:16:25.280 --> 00:16:30.280
that they mitigated the non-performer kind of out of the picture and it worked

277
00:16:30.771 --> 00:16:35.420
out well.
Um,
I think the lesson there is that,
you know,
like I mentioned earlier,

278
00:16:35.421 --> 00:16:37.540
like you can win the tactical battle and lose this,

279
00:16:37.541 --> 00:16:40.100
the strategic a war and you certainly don't want to do that.

280
00:16:40.101 --> 00:16:41.750
I think you've got to recognize when you're,

281
00:16:41.900 --> 00:16:45.260
whether it's terminating someone or making decisions.
Uh,

282
00:16:45.261 --> 00:16:46.920
I think that's where we had,
you know,

283
00:16:46.940 --> 00:16:50.130
you had that strategic picture in mind and I was focused a little more on the,

284
00:16:50.131 --> 00:16:52.970
on the tactical side.
So,
um,
you gotta you gotta keep,

285
00:16:53.390 --> 00:16:56.270
you can make the right tactical call and can have some real strategic

286
00:16:56.271 --> 00:16:59.210
consequences,
you know,
the cascade and cause you a lot more problems.

287
00:16:59.630 --> 00:17:02.450
I think though that the,
my true answer,

288
00:17:02.451 --> 00:17:07.451
this question on our most fundamental disagreement came on patches and uh,

289
00:17:08.720 --> 00:17:09.650
that was,
uh,

290
00:17:09.710 --> 00:17:14.480
Jocko was understood as seals that we needed to be squared away.

291
00:17:14.690 --> 00:17:17.450
We wanted to be storm troopers and t you bruiser that's what we wanted to,

292
00:17:17.480 --> 00:17:21.050
we wanted to all look the same.
We wanted to have,
uh,
you know,
squared away,

293
00:17:21.051 --> 00:17:23.630
haircuts,
quarter a uniforms,
everybody in the same,
same year.

294
00:17:23.631 --> 00:17:27.330
That's hard for seals cause seals often want to just kind of where uh,
you know,

295
00:17:27.350 --> 00:17:31.610
mix and match of uniforms and kind of whatever gear that they want to look cool,

296
00:17:31.640 --> 00:17:33.080
straight up long hair,

297
00:17:33.081 --> 00:17:36.200
beard to all those things you recognize that we needed to when you do that and,

298
00:17:36.360 --> 00:17:39.260
and guys can get out of control.
We have all these patches made that are,

299
00:17:39.770 --> 00:17:43.250
you know,
that are like look at these cool guy.
I've got patches all over me and,

300
00:17:43.580 --> 00:17:45.980
and uh,
and,
and that's seals.
There's some of the best,
you know,

301
00:17:45.981 --> 00:17:50.130
the biggest offenders of that.
So Jocko was like no patches.
And just to expand

302
00:17:50.130 --> 00:17:53.490
<v 2>on this a little bit more,
but strategically from the army,
from the Marine Corp,</v>

303
00:17:53.580 --> 00:17:54.480
the army in the Marine Corps,

304
00:17:54.481 --> 00:17:57.150
when they look at someone that's not in a square to you two squared away
uniform,

305
00:17:57.180 --> 00:17:59.340
they think they think to themselves,
Hey,

306
00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:01.530
if this guy can't even wear a squared away uniform,

307
00:18:01.560 --> 00:18:04.130
how can he operate out in the battlefield?
And that that's what,

308
00:18:04.140 --> 00:18:06.600
what they think and good for them because it's a true statement.

309
00:18:06.750 --> 00:18:10.170
If you've got someone that can't mind some,
some details and look squared away,

310
00:18:10.380 --> 00:18:14.460
then how can,
how can I expect them to do their job?
Well now in the,

311
00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:17.190
in the seal teams and really in all soft communities,

312
00:18:17.191 --> 00:18:21.450
there's some absolute laxity when it comes to uniform requirements.

313
00:18:21.451 --> 00:18:24.690
That's why you see pictures of guys doing this,
uh,
you know,

314
00:18:24.691 --> 00:18:27.480
dressing out of uniform and mix and match in uniforms.
It's,
it's the way it is.

315
00:18:27.720 --> 00:18:29.850
And you know what my,
in my,

316
00:18:30.750 --> 00:18:34.470
in my deepest knowledge,
I know that you can have,

317
00:18:34.590 --> 00:18:37.410
and this is a classic military quotas,
you know,
uh,

318
00:18:37.860 --> 00:18:42.860
an inspection ready platoon has never passed combat and a combat ready platoon

319
00:18:43.411 --> 00:18:44.800
has never passed inspection.
It's,

320
00:18:44.860 --> 00:18:48.840
it's a commonly known thing that I understand and I get and,

321
00:18:49.650 --> 00:18:53.670
but especially where new in the battlespace,
we're just showing up here.
We got,

322
00:18:53.880 --> 00:18:54.180
you know,

323
00:18:54.180 --> 00:18:58.530
marines and Army soldiers and senior leadership that we're going to be working

324
00:18:58.531 --> 00:19:00.960
for.
And I say,
okay,
we're gonna make this is the bait.
The fundamentally,

325
00:19:00.990 --> 00:19:03.450
we're going to make a good first impression.
We're going to look square it away,

326
00:19:03.630 --> 00:19:06.230
which means we're gonna,
you know,
have squared away haircuts.

327
00:19:06.290 --> 00:19:10.830
We're going to bounce our boots and we're going to wear a normal looking
uniform,

328
00:19:10.950 --> 00:19:14.520
which means we don't have crazy looking patches that,

329
00:19:14.580 --> 00:19:16.910
that make us look different.
Right.
Cause it's,

330
00:19:16.980 --> 00:19:19.290
that's the thing that you're saying,
the thing that you're saying is look at me.

331
00:19:19.410 --> 00:19:22.800
That's what you're saying.
Look at me.
I'm cool.
That's what a patch is.
It's,
hey,

332
00:19:22.801 --> 00:19:26.270
look at me.
I'm special.
And,
and,

333
00:19:26.271 --> 00:19:30.540
and obviously I don't like that attitude.
And so here we go back to the patches.

334
00:19:31.230 --> 00:19:33.610
So we,
I mean when you told me we were,

335
00:19:33.620 --> 00:19:37.050
we were on board with everything on the same page and we saw eye to eye on so

336
00:19:37.051 --> 00:19:41.400
many things.
It certainly me and the Deltona commander,
uh,
would you?
Absolutely.

337
00:19:41.430 --> 00:19:46.110
And,
uh,
but that was,
I don't know why,
but for one reason we got together.

338
00:19:46.111 --> 00:19:49.350
I was like,
we designed our own patches where like,
where when you say we,

339
00:19:49.490 --> 00:19:52.590
you mean you and the Delta,
me and the Delta platoon commander,
we,

340
00:19:53.910 --> 00:19:57.750
me and the Delta commander said we're going to design some batches for task and

341
00:19:57.751 --> 00:19:59.940
bruiser and I don't know.
I don't know.

342
00:19:59.990 --> 00:20:03.330
Why have we just had an idea that this was going to be a historic unit.

343
00:20:03.331 --> 00:20:04.710
This is going to be something we want it to be a part of,

344
00:20:04.711 --> 00:20:08.040
but we felt like we needed to tasking it backs.

345
00:20:08.041 --> 00:20:11.460
And I felt like you secretly wanted us to have them even though you told us not

346
00:20:11.461 --> 00:20:15.240
to do it.
So sounds like we designed these badges.

347
00:20:15.241 --> 00:20:19.440
One of them I use the Lord humongous from the road warrior,
uh,

348
00:20:19.530 --> 00:20:24.510
for one and a.
The other one we had a,
we had a big cow skull and a,
and it was,

349
00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:27.750
so we had these two dispatches without,
we had a maid.
So we,

350
00:20:27.751 --> 00:20:30.920
I secretly had them shift.
I secretly had them distributed to,
uh,

351
00:20:31.080 --> 00:20:35.680
to both platoons.
And we keep them in our shoulder patch pocket and we'd be,
uh,

352
00:20:35.690 --> 00:20:38.910
so we'd be in a convoy ready to roll out.
Jocko would come out,
see everybody off,

353
00:20:38.911 --> 00:20:40.980
shake hands with everybody,
uh,

354
00:20:40.981 --> 00:20:45.330
and we'd be launched on the operation and that we'd come up over the radio,

355
00:20:45.360 --> 00:20:48.370
my leading pet,
how should come up with a ready and be like patches on everyone,

356
00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:50.360
pull the badges out,
slap the badges on it.
And then we,

357
00:20:50.980 --> 00:20:54.890
although we got busted when there was an embedded reporter with a,

358
00:20:54.990 --> 00:20:56.980
there was an embedded reporter,
uh,

359
00:20:57.160 --> 00:21:00.520
with one of the units we were working with and there were some photos of
patches.

360
00:21:00.550 --> 00:21:04.660
So we got busted.
Although you didn't,
you didn't come down on me hard like that.

361
00:21:04.661 --> 00:21:06.340
You just,
I just,

362
00:21:06.341 --> 00:21:09.240
cause you mentioned that we had this conversation on text the other day and I'm,

363
00:21:09.250 --> 00:21:12.820
I'm actually good.
I just pulled out my phone to read this text back and forth.

364
00:21:12.821 --> 00:21:17.470
We were just talking about,
um,
you were basically saying,
hey,
you know,
you,

365
00:21:17.500 --> 00:21:20.710
that's not forget you didn't want us to wear patches and,
and,
and then,

366
00:21:20.810 --> 00:21:22.330
and then I wrote back to you a,

367
00:21:22.510 --> 00:21:26.890
don't forget that while I was out outwardly disapproving inside,

368
00:21:26.891 --> 00:21:27.640
I was smiling.

369
00:21:27.640 --> 00:21:31.780
Knowing that a little rebelliousness isn't important is important for leaders to

370
00:21:31.781 --> 00:21:36.670
possess and that a spree decor trumps compliance and uniformity.

371
00:21:36.850 --> 00:21:39.670
Oh,
that's an actual text conversation we were having.

372
00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:44.590
That's kind of jacked up isn't it?
But my point is like you got,
you know,

373
00:21:44.591 --> 00:21:47.230
obviously it meant something to you and it was bringing the team together.

374
00:21:47.231 --> 00:21:49.540
It's to swing.
When you go through boot camp and the drought,

375
00:21:49.570 --> 00:21:52.000
Joan instructors will let you get away with something because they know it's

376
00:21:52.050 --> 00:21:54.550
unifying the team.
And that's what it was for me.
I was like,
okay.

377
00:21:54.730 --> 00:21:57.550
And also how much leadership capital am I going to expand?

378
00:21:57.730 --> 00:22:00.140
Because even though I just made it sound like there's a big deal at that.

379
00:22:00.880 --> 00:22:03.500
And also we had earned a good reputation.
We,

380
00:22:03.520 --> 00:22:06.460
it wasn't a first impression anymore.
It was like the impression had been made.

381
00:22:06.461 --> 00:22:09.160
And the impression was solid.
And so now it's like,
oh yeah,

382
00:22:09.190 --> 00:22:10.640
these guys are these guys.
Oh yeah,
they,

383
00:22:10.680 --> 00:22:14.320
they're actually a unit identifying patch.
So we actually,

384
00:22:14.321 --> 00:22:17.560
and we gave that patch to the brigade commander department,
which was awesome.

385
00:22:17.590 --> 00:22:20.350
And I'm very proud to say that,
uh,
uh,

386
00:22:20.351 --> 00:22:24.730
there's not a whole lot up on the wall and the Jocko Gym,
but uh,

387
00:22:24.880 --> 00:22:29.000
in the garage there.
But,
uh,
but there is a t you bruiser pads.

388
00:22:29.620 --> 00:22:32.650
Lord humongous represents,
there's a seven echo from my,

389
00:22:32.680 --> 00:22:36.370
from my echo platoon at team seven.
And there's a seal team one patch.
I mean,

390
00:22:36.371 --> 00:22:39.400
a sticker.
That's my,
that's my,
uh,
wall of glory

391
00:22:41.410 --> 00:22:45.250
stapled to the wall.
Awesome.
All right,
next question.

392
00:22:45.330 --> 00:22:49.320
So that's the one question that we're 20 minutes deep.
You gotta like that.
Um,

393
00:22:49.420 --> 00:22:50.740
all right.
Next question.

394
00:22:52.360 --> 00:22:54.790
Can you discuss the evolution of Echelon Front?

395
00:22:54.791 --> 00:22:58.090
Was the company ready for the explosive popularity of extreme ownership?

396
00:22:58.090 --> 00:22:59.740
What kinds of challenges have you faced?

397
00:23:00.790 --> 00:23:03.610
We faced all kinds of challenges and the same challenges that a,

398
00:23:03.611 --> 00:23:07.960
that any business faces,
uh,
certainly.
And you know,
for,
for us,

399
00:23:07.961 --> 00:23:11.230
it's been learned to the firehouse.
It's been,
it's been an awesome experience.

400
00:23:11.231 --> 00:23:14.920
I mean,
I,
I think,
uh,
just like any,
just like our,
our combat experience,

401
00:23:14.921 --> 00:23:16.990
we would adapt to the battlefield.
We learned,

402
00:23:17.140 --> 00:23:20.470
we educated ourselves about things that we didn't know about and,
and,
uh,

403
00:23:20.471 --> 00:23:23.080
and we've grown.
I mean,
I don't think anyone could,

404
00:23:23.290 --> 00:23:26.800
I don't know if we could have predicted just how widely disseminated the the

405
00:23:26.801 --> 00:23:29.050
book would be or,
or,
uh,
you know,

406
00:23:29.051 --> 00:23:31.360
the popular of the things that we're talking about.
We knew they were powerful.

407
00:23:31.361 --> 00:23:34.900
It's a whole reason we wrote the books.
There was a massive demand signal for it.

408
00:23:35.410 --> 00:23:38.470
And,
uh,
and I think,
you know,
as we work with companies now through a,

409
00:23:38.480 --> 00:23:41.830
I'll come national on fraud.
I mean,
there's just,
we're,
we're able to go and,

410
00:23:42.370 --> 00:23:45.710
and deliver a,
some impact to teams,

411
00:23:45.980 --> 00:23:48.270
<v 3>uh,
in a way that other people aren't able to do it.</v>

412
00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:52.010
Because most of the folks in that space are,
it's a feelgood thing.

413
00:23:52.040 --> 00:23:54.380
You're out there to talk about,
hey,
you guys,

414
00:23:54.381 --> 00:23:57.890
you're great and let's harness your inner potential and all this kind of stuff.

415
00:23:57.930 --> 00:24:02.240
And I laugh when people call us motivational speakers because a,

416
00:24:02.241 --> 00:24:04.880
I say motivational speakers tell you how good,
good you are.

417
00:24:05.150 --> 00:24:07.430
And we're here to tell you how much you suck and be better.

418
00:24:07.490 --> 00:24:11.180
You got to get better if you want to win.
So,
um,
that's what we do.

419
00:24:11.181 --> 00:24:12.830
And I think it's the same,
same way that,
that,

420
00:24:12.831 --> 00:24:14.870
that brutally honest assessment of yourself,
your team,

421
00:24:14.990 --> 00:24:16.550
the same thing that makes you know,

422
00:24:16.551 --> 00:24:19.640
seal unit successful on the battlefield and other military units is the same

423
00:24:19.641 --> 00:24:22.010
thing that we're doing now with our company.
Certainly,
you know,

424
00:24:22.011 --> 00:24:25.850
all the challenges of,
of bookkeeping and,
and,
and uh,
you know,

425
00:24:26.120 --> 00:24:29.930
the billing processes and,
and pay in taxes.
And I mean,

426
00:24:29.931 --> 00:24:32.270
just the regulatory environment,
those things that,

427
00:24:32.271 --> 00:24:34.520
that make it hard for any business launching a,

428
00:24:34.521 --> 00:24:38.810
but just like on the battlefield where we can either bitch about the paperwork

429
00:24:38.960 --> 00:24:42.140
or we could figure out a way to most efficiently get it done so that we could

430
00:24:42.141 --> 00:24:46.190
actually go accomplish the mission,
uh,
which you instilled in us.
Like,
Hey,

431
00:24:46.310 --> 00:24:47.450
I can complain about it all day.

432
00:24:47.470 --> 00:24:49.730
I can figure out a way to get this done and make it happen because that's what

433
00:24:49.731 --> 00:24:53.640
it requires to do.
And that's what we're doing with our business.
Uh,
and it's,

434
00:24:53.641 --> 00:24:55.270
it's been awesome.
And,
and frankly,

435
00:24:55.271 --> 00:24:59.720
you know what I love is working with leaders in so many of the folks that

436
00:24:59.721 --> 00:25:01.140
contact us that want to work with us there,

437
00:25:01.290 --> 00:25:04.700
they're already doing well and they want to do even better.
And,

438
00:25:04.770 --> 00:25:09.470
and it's just so much fun to work with folks who want to just constantly grow

439
00:25:09.471 --> 00:25:13.580
and learn and we grow and learn all the time from them.
Yeah.
Yeah.

440
00:25:14.990 --> 00:25:15.823
I think you hit it all.

441
00:25:17.480 --> 00:25:21.740
Mex Quest in battle,
having the high ground is crucial.

442
00:25:22.430 --> 00:25:25.640
How do you see this principle applied to the business world?
And,
and we have,

443
00:25:25.700 --> 00:25:28.490
I've answered this question before with the statement,

444
00:25:29.600 --> 00:25:34.340
take the high ground to the high ground.
We'll take you.
So business world.
Okay.

445
00:25:34.341 --> 00:25:37.850
Well tactically,
what do you think the high ground,

446
00:25:38.690 --> 00:25:40.880
well though I think that's the,
that's the real question,
right?

447
00:25:41.540 --> 00:25:45.500
Why is the high ground important?
And obviously,
you know,

448
00:25:45.501 --> 00:25:48.670
out of thousands of years of military history,
um,
the,

449
00:25:48.671 --> 00:25:52.010
the high grounds always important by the way.
I did have a,

450
00:25:52.011 --> 00:25:54.420
I did have a training instructor a few years ago.
My,

451
00:25:54.530 --> 00:25:57.170
my seal team days who we had,
he said,

452
00:25:57.171 --> 00:26:00.390
look at your high speed altimeter watch and uh,
and,

453
00:26:00.520 --> 00:26:04.100
and you get get down behind something.
So he was basically telling us like,

454
00:26:04.130 --> 00:26:06.650
if that thing's going up,
you're wrong.
That she thinks she'd be going down.

455
00:26:06.651 --> 00:26:09.470
He was,
he was telling us to take the low ground,
which was,
uh,

456
00:26:09.800 --> 00:26:13.400
which was kind of laughable.
So outdoing thousands of years of,

457
00:26:13.401 --> 00:26:17.180
of military history always take the low ground.
No,
don't do that.

458
00:26:17.210 --> 00:26:19.640
You want to take the high ground.
The reason is because tactically,

459
00:26:19.670 --> 00:26:22.820
if you're on the high ground,
you,
you have got a better shooting position.

460
00:26:22.821 --> 00:26:26.240
You can shoot down on people who can't hide very well because you,
you,

461
00:26:26.330 --> 00:26:29.870
you're above them.
Which is why it was awesome for us to be in buildings.

462
00:26:29.960 --> 00:26:32.840
And if we could get a three or four story building in this,
you know,
in the city,

463
00:26:32.860 --> 00:26:34.760
reminding the urban environment,
we,
it was awesome.

464
00:26:35.030 --> 00:26:36.660
It's no different in the business environment.
And,

465
00:26:36.661 --> 00:26:39.170
and what you have to do is just identified the key terrain.

466
00:26:39.470 --> 00:26:43.980
What is the key to the high ground is key terrain.
Uh,
so it doesn't,
it doesn't

467
00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:45.150
<v 2>necessarily mean that you know,</v>

468
00:26:45.850 --> 00:26:48.600
you're going to go climb to the mountain top because that's where you want to
be.

469
00:26:48.830 --> 00:26:49.950
Uh,
but,
but if,

470
00:26:49.980 --> 00:26:52.980
if that ridge line that's on the high ground gives you tackle vantage on the

471
00:26:52.981 --> 00:26:55.260
battlefield,
that's,
it's the same thing in the business world.
If you're,

472
00:26:55.470 --> 00:26:58.380
if you're a retailer,
you know,
where's that key terrain?

473
00:26:58.381 --> 00:27:00.570
Where's the intersection that,
that's,
that you want to be,

474
00:27:00.571 --> 00:27:03.390
that's going to give your business the best,
uh,
you know,

475
00:27:03.391 --> 00:27:07.980
the best chance to succeed if you're,
um,
you know,
any space.
I mean,
there's,

476
00:27:07.981 --> 00:27:10.590
there's key terrain that you can identify where you want to be a part of.

477
00:27:10.630 --> 00:27:11.220
If it's,

478
00:27:11.220 --> 00:27:13.920
if you're a private equity company and you're trying to break into some new,

479
00:27:14.530 --> 00:27:18.560
some new technology or new,
uh,
a new new,
particular industry,
that's,

480
00:27:18.600 --> 00:27:19.470
that's key terrain.

481
00:27:19.500 --> 00:27:22.070
You need to be focused on that and identifying that as critical,

482
00:27:22.080 --> 00:27:26.340
why it's important.
Um,
and,
and everyone's going to be going to be vying for that.

483
00:27:26.341 --> 00:27:28.910
And you want to be aggressive if you want to a maneuver a,

484
00:27:28.920 --> 00:27:33.120
because if you get there first,
um,
you're going to be a lot better position.
It's,

485
00:27:33.380 --> 00:27:35.220
it's flanker be flank.
We always say,
you know,

486
00:27:35.250 --> 00:27:37.830
your maneuver on the enemy and they're gonna maneuver on you.
Um,

487
00:27:37.831 --> 00:27:41.550
so what you don't want to do is wait for somebody else to get in a better

488
00:27:41.551 --> 00:27:44.380
position,
and then you actually have to fight your way out of that.
It's,

489
00:27:44.430 --> 00:27:47.070
it's not good.
Like,
and Jujitsu,
you don't want to wait to,

490
00:27:47.080 --> 00:27:50.040
someone's going to mount you.
That's not a good place to be or take your back.

491
00:27:50.041 --> 00:27:53.580
Right?
You want to try to prevent that before we can get there.
Uh,
and,
uh,

492
00:27:53.581 --> 00:27:55.950
and if you can do that to them first and you're in a much better position.

493
00:27:55.950 --> 00:27:58.680
And I think it's no different.
And the business world,
I had her,

494
00:27:58.770 --> 00:28:02.760
it was working with a company the other day and basically what they were saying

495
00:28:02.761 --> 00:28:06.570
was that their competitor was lying about them too,
too.

496
00:28:06.600 --> 00:28:08.450
As they're trying to close accounts there,

497
00:28:08.570 --> 00:28:12.240
their competitor would go in the field and say,
Oh yeah,
this,
this,

498
00:28:12.360 --> 00:28:14.790
the company are this to this company.
They don't do it right.

499
00:28:14.791 --> 00:28:16.170
And they don't have these accounts and they're,

500
00:28:16.380 --> 00:28:18.660
they're going out of business and everything's bad.
So there's,

501
00:28:18.810 --> 00:28:22.590
there's their competitors were out there lying about them and you know,

502
00:28:22.591 --> 00:28:26.490
the sales leader said,
you know,
I don't,
I don't want to stoop to their level,

503
00:28:26.940 --> 00:28:30.660
you know,
and,
and start throwing lies out there about them or making accusations.

504
00:28:30.661 --> 00:28:33.750
I think that's,
you know,
I said,
well,
no,
you don't want to take the low ground.

505
00:28:33.780 --> 00:28:37.050
You want to take the high ground.
And he said,
well,
yeah,
but at the same time,

506
00:28:37.051 --> 00:28:38.610
what,
what are we supposed to do?
And I said,
well,

507
00:28:39.720 --> 00:28:42.720
you actually have the most powerful weapon in this fight.

508
00:28:43.140 --> 00:28:46.080
The weapon that you have is the truth.
You have the,
you have the truth,

509
00:28:46.380 --> 00:28:47.670
but you're not getting the truth out there.
I said,

510
00:28:47.671 --> 00:28:49.260
what do you do when you do close an account?
What do you do?

511
00:28:49.261 --> 00:28:53.820
How do you publicize it needs to cool?
We really don't.
And I said,
well,

512
00:28:53.850 --> 00:28:56.940
do you,
do you do a press release when you closed a big account?
No,

513
00:28:56.941 --> 00:29:00.120
we don't do that.
Do you advertise it anyway?
No,
we don't do that.
I said,

514
00:29:00.121 --> 00:29:02.790
so the most powerful weapon you have is the truth and you're not utilizing that

515
00:29:02.791 --> 00:29:03.360
weapon.

516
00:29:03.360 --> 00:29:07.890
Do you need to have a propaganda arm at this company that's going to go out

517
00:29:07.891 --> 00:29:12.000
there and explain that though all the wins and what the truth really is and that

518
00:29:12.001 --> 00:29:15.300
will be more powerful.
And then you can maintain the high ground.
And by the way,

519
00:29:15.750 --> 00:29:19.770
when those other companies are out there lying about you and then people find

520
00:29:19.771 --> 00:29:22.110
out,
it makes them look even worse.

521
00:29:23.010 --> 00:29:27.420
So they've broken their trust with,
with the potential client.
So,
yeah,

522
00:29:27.570 --> 00:29:29.290
always take the high ground.
Always take that ground.

523
00:29:29.760 --> 00:29:33.670
It might not win you the short term battle in business,
right?
Um,

524
00:29:34.680 --> 00:29:37.500
you know,
you see,
you see companies,
you know,
like,
uh,

525
00:29:38.010 --> 00:29:42.070
I can sell you this thing right now.
I can,
I can paint this thing,

526
00:29:42.070 --> 00:29:45.250
<v 0>put a fresh coat of paint on it and sell it to you.
That's not the high ground,</v>

527
00:29:45.251 --> 00:29:46.510
right?
That's the low ground.
Cause it's gonna.

528
00:29:46.570 --> 00:29:49.000
It's gonna fail you cause it's on what's underneath the hood is crap.

529
00:29:49.720 --> 00:29:52.180
So that might win me,
you know,
that one sale.

530
00:29:52.420 --> 00:29:55.970
But what's going to happen in the long road?
Taking the low ground,
you're gonna,

531
00:29:56.110 --> 00:29:59.650
you're gonna put on Yelp that you got a crappy deal.
And I did.
You know,

532
00:29:59.651 --> 00:30:02.440
I repainted something and sold it to you and it wasn't worth it.

533
00:30:02.650 --> 00:30:06.580
And now that reputation is going to spread and it's not going to help you if you

534
00:30:06.581 --> 00:30:07.450
take the high ground,
hey,

535
00:30:07.540 --> 00:30:09.730
here's what's going on with his vehicle or whatever you're selling,

536
00:30:11.020 --> 00:30:12.660
take the high ground.
There's all closing.

537
00:30:12.900 --> 00:30:16.500
<v 3>That is,
is we,
we see so many leaders and some of those successful people.</v>

538
00:30:16.501 --> 00:30:20.130
We do that recognize how important that is to build relationships and they're,

539
00:30:20.370 --> 00:30:24.180
they're willing to,
to lose a sale or lose,
uh,
uh,
you know,

540
00:30:24.181 --> 00:30:26.850
to send someone to a competitor just to,

541
00:30:26.851 --> 00:30:30.090
just to make sure that person gets exactly what they need and they're building

542
00:30:30.091 --> 00:30:32.850
relationships.
So that means more business gets sent to them.

543
00:30:33.060 --> 00:30:34.750
<v 0>It's what you started off talking about.</v>

544
00:30:34.810 --> 00:30:37.680
It's a strategic win as opposed to a tactical wind and that,

545
00:30:37.681 --> 00:30:40.450
and that's what you've gotta be focused on.
And that's really as a leader,

546
00:30:40.451 --> 00:30:41.500
that's what you gotta be looking at it.

547
00:30:41.501 --> 00:30:44.770
You gotta be looking at your front line people and making sure that they,

548
00:30:44.780 --> 00:30:46.840
they're not just out there trying to win every little tactical battle,

549
00:30:46.841 --> 00:30:49.660
but they're going backwards strategically.
So keep that in mind.

550
00:30:49.661 --> 00:30:52.660
That's why you have to detach.
That's why you have to stay out of the weeds.

551
00:30:52.720 --> 00:30:53.441
And when you get in the weeds,

552
00:30:53.441 --> 00:30:56.320
you got to step back out of them because otherwise you lose track of that and

553
00:30:56.321 --> 00:31:00.940
you're going to end up in a low ground before you even recognize it.
All right,

554
00:31:00.941 --> 00:31:02.080
next question.

555
00:31:03.580 --> 00:31:06.790
How do you control rumors and gossip within an organization?

556
00:31:08.460 --> 00:31:11.490
<v 3>That's pretty easy.
You just,
you just talked about being,
you know,</v>

557
00:31:11.491 --> 00:31:14.340
getting out there for the truth and your propaganda arm to outside your company.

558
00:31:14.341 --> 00:31:18.060
It's no different inside your company.
You've got to make sure that people,

559
00:31:19.440 --> 00:31:20.910
I,
it's interesting that when you were,

560
00:31:20.920 --> 00:31:23.490
we work with leaders sometimes you see people that are like,
well,

561
00:31:23.520 --> 00:31:25.590
I don't want to share those with my people.
You know,

562
00:31:25.591 --> 00:31:27.100
cause I don't know what they might think.
Like they're,

563
00:31:27.101 --> 00:31:29.880
or they're thinking something that may be totally not true.

564
00:31:30.060 --> 00:31:32.970
They're not just sitting there not thinking anything because you're not sharing

565
00:31:32.971 --> 00:31:34.800
it with them.
They're coming up to their own conclusions,

566
00:31:34.920 --> 00:31:38.430
which may be completely false or opposite.
But like we say in the,
in the,

567
00:31:38.431 --> 00:31:42.060
in the navy all the time,
you know,
perception is reality.
That becomes reality.

568
00:31:42.270 --> 00:31:44.130
So you've got to,
you got to,

569
00:31:44.131 --> 00:31:48.330
you can defeat the gossip and rumors by actually just sharing the truth.

570
00:31:48.330 --> 00:31:51.220
Be Open with people and uh,
and,
and,
and,

571
00:31:51.310 --> 00:31:53.730
and be in first out there with a message so people get an understanding.

572
00:31:53.731 --> 00:31:57.440
And even when horrible,
bad things go wrong,
extreme ownership,
right?
If,

573
00:31:57.560 --> 00:32:00.600
if you take ownership for that and say,
Hey,
listen,
this happened.

574
00:32:00.750 --> 00:32:01.890
Here's what we're doing to fix it.

575
00:32:02.040 --> 00:32:04.360
Here's what we're doing to turn things around it.

576
00:32:04.370 --> 00:32:07.050
It's going to be people.

577
00:32:07.080 --> 00:32:09.780
People are not going to lose respect for you and the organization.

578
00:32:09.970 --> 00:32:11.760
They're actually going to gain respect for you as a result.

579
00:32:11.761 --> 00:32:16.350
Something we talk about all the time.
So don't be afraid to do that again,

580
00:32:16.410 --> 00:32:20.430
just get the message out there and,
and be transparent and talk to folks.

581
00:32:24.550 --> 00:32:26.500
<v 0>If you don't tell people what's going on,</v>

582
00:32:26.501 --> 00:32:31.501
they're going to make up their own ideas of what's going on and the thing that I

583
00:32:31.871 --> 00:32:32.704
have to,

584
00:32:33.770 --> 00:32:34.450
<v 1>yeah,</v>

585
00:32:34.450 --> 00:32:38.050
<v 0>I have to,
we have to,
we have to take this just a little bit further,
right?</v>

586
00:32:38.110 --> 00:32:41.000
Just a little bit further because we talk about transparency,
right?

587
00:32:41.001 --> 00:32:46.001
And that word gets thrown around all the time and have the idea that you're just

588
00:32:46.671 --> 00:32:47.310
going to use that,

589
00:32:47.310 --> 00:32:51.080
the idea that you're just going to tell everyone exactly what's going on and

590
00:32:51.110 --> 00:32:54.120
that sounds great.
And it's like,
Hey,
I'm a fully transparent leader.

591
00:32:54.121 --> 00:32:55.010
And I'm gonna tell her what's going on.

592
00:32:55.100 --> 00:32:58.070
But there's times where you actually don't want to do that.

593
00:32:58.100 --> 00:33:03.020
There's times where you have to maneuver and you have to be tactful and some of

594
00:33:03.021 --> 00:33:06.650
the things that you might tell someone actually is not the right thing to do.

595
00:33:06.920 --> 00:33:10.820
Now,
am I,
I'm not saying we're,
we're,
we're going to be dishonest with our people.

596
00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:14.360
I'm not saying that and I'm saying that transparency's great thing,
but I mean,

597
00:33:14.361 --> 00:33:18.650
just on a personal level,
if laughs,
laughs,
uh,

598
00:33:18.740 --> 00:33:22.940
working for me and he's not doing what he's doing,

599
00:33:22.941 --> 00:33:26.510
something horrible is the best way to go about that to fully true,

600
00:33:26.511 --> 00:33:29.180
full transparency is,
Hailey,
you're doing horrible at this.

601
00:33:29.450 --> 00:33:32.690
Is that the best way to do it in front of the entire team in front of the right

602
00:33:32.691 --> 00:33:35.930
is that,
is that it's full transparency,
right?
Hey,
I'm fully transparent.
Okay,

603
00:33:35.931 --> 00:33:37.490
everyone welcome to the meeting today,
by the way.

604
00:33:37.491 --> 00:33:40.970
I just wanted to point it out that life mrs numbers again and he's a loser.

605
00:33:41.660 --> 00:33:44.350
That might be what I'm thinking.
That's fully transparent.
Hey guys,
just be,

606
00:33:44.470 --> 00:33:48.740
I need,
love this too,
right?
Just being transparent,
layoffs,
layoffs,
a loser.

607
00:33:48.770 --> 00:33:50.960
He missed his numbers again.
And you know what?

608
00:33:50.961 --> 00:33:53.840
I'm actually thinking about firing him just in case anyone was wondering.

609
00:33:54.410 --> 00:33:55.560
So that's,
that's for trucks.

610
00:33:55.620 --> 00:33:59.450
It's not going away to close of business Friday did I do a good job?
Right?
So,

611
00:33:59.510 --> 00:34:03.380
so let's not get carried away,
right?
You know,
what is the smart way,

612
00:34:03.410 --> 00:34:06.860
the smart ways to maneuver.
The smart way is to say,
okay,
lace not doing what he,

613
00:34:06.980 --> 00:34:11.750
what he wants,
what he should be doing.
If I go and accuse him of failing,

614
00:34:11.780 --> 00:34:16.130
what's his reaction going to be?
How's it?
So what do I do instead?

615
00:34:16.520 --> 00:34:20.370
Instead I go,
I want to take ownership of it.
And so instead I say,
hey leaf,

616
00:34:21.110 --> 00:34:24.320
you know,
hey comes in,
come to come conquer my office.

617
00:34:24.321 --> 00:34:25.280
I want to talk to you about a couple of things.

618
00:34:25.281 --> 00:34:29.630
So he comes to my office or not in a public place and now it's,
hey leaf.
Hey Man,

619
00:34:29.631 --> 00:34:31.280
I noticed that you,
you know,
you,
you,

620
00:34:31.281 --> 00:34:34.340
you missed your numbers and I'm thinking that maybe I'm not giving you the kind

621
00:34:34.341 --> 00:34:36.980
of support that you need to,
to get where you need to be.

622
00:34:37.040 --> 00:34:41.510
Is there anything that else that you need from me so that you can win again

623
00:34:41.660 --> 00:34:45.950
inside?
Sure.
I'm thinking Lafe you pathetic loser.

624
00:34:45.980 --> 00:34:49.370
You missed your numbers again.
Right.
But I'm not going to do that.

625
00:34:49.610 --> 00:34:51.500
So the full transparency thing,

626
00:34:52.010 --> 00:34:54.800
I get it and it makes sense,

627
00:34:55.400 --> 00:35:00.400
but we do have to consider the tertiary and the secondary and tertiary effects

628
00:35:01.760 --> 00:35:03.350
of the things that we say,
especially as a leader.

629
00:35:03.590 --> 00:35:06.350
What you say is a lot of impact as a leader.
And sometimes I see leaders,

630
00:35:06.351 --> 00:35:09.560
they make a little off the cuff remark about something,
you know?
Oh,

631
00:35:09.920 --> 00:35:14.750
that won't matter.
Oh,
oh,
oh,
okay.
So it doesn't matter.
So,
so this little thing,

632
00:35:14.800 --> 00:35:18.560
you know,
hey,
hey boss,
we wanted to get this task done by this date.

633
00:35:19.280 --> 00:35:21.770
Is it still important?
Od doesn't matter.
Oh,
okay.
So it doesn't matter.

634
00:35:21.771 --> 00:35:24.500
So when I was working on for the last month and a half,
doesn't matter.
Okay,
cool.

635
00:35:24.501 --> 00:35:29.360
Great.
I was fully transparent.
So just be careful.
Use Tact.

636
00:35:29.670 --> 00:35:33.330
Use your brain.
Yeah,
that's,
that's 100% correct.
I think,
you know,

637
00:35:33.410 --> 00:35:34.610
what I was trying to explain in the,

638
00:35:34.611 --> 00:35:37.920
in the first situation is I was having a conversation with a leader,
uh,

639
00:35:38.280 --> 00:35:42.470
<v 4>that we work with who was telling me that a,</v>

640
00:35:42.510 --> 00:35:45.120
there was a key leader in his team that didn't want to share with any of these

641
00:35:45.121 --> 00:35:50.040
key leaders that they,
uh,
you know,
they,
they're the,

642
00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:52.620
he didn't want to share with the key leaders that they were,

643
00:35:52.650 --> 00:35:56.400
they were having as having some issues,
having some dire straights wonder,

644
00:35:56.401 --> 00:35:58.800
you know,
getting to a point where they're wondering,
Hey,

645
00:35:58.830 --> 00:36:01.440
I don't know if we're going to make payroll,
you know,

646
00:36:01.470 --> 00:36:03.780
a few months from now if we don't turn these things around.

647
00:36:04.050 --> 00:36:07.050
But I don't want to share that with them because I don't want him to panic.

648
00:36:07.770 --> 00:36:10.760
And when I laugh when I heard that,
I was like,
uh,

649
00:36:10.950 --> 00:36:15.630
what kind of panic or are they going to have when they find out they can't make

650
00:36:15.631 --> 00:36:17.940
payroll but no one told them about and they thought everything was great.

651
00:36:18.060 --> 00:36:21.750
So the pen is going to be a hundred times worse.
Yeah.
And,
and that's,

652
00:36:21.780 --> 00:36:24.000
that's the kind of transparency I'm talking about.
We were like,
listen,

653
00:36:24.150 --> 00:36:26.610
you need to go and have a direct conversation and say,
guys,

654
00:36:26.670 --> 00:36:30.150
here's where we're at.
Yup.
And that should be something to help get them in gear.

655
00:36:30.180 --> 00:36:33.540
I'd be like,
listen,
we have got to,
we got to hit these numbers.

656
00:36:33.541 --> 00:36:36.000
We've got to get things going again.
We've got a turn performance around our,

657
00:36:36.001 --> 00:36:39.450
this is where we're going to be next quarter.
Uh,
if,
if we don't do that,

658
00:36:39.451 --> 00:36:40.370
and I think those,
uh,

659
00:36:40.740 --> 00:36:44.220
that's the kind of thing I'm talking about where you're not keeping the secrets

660
00:36:44.280 --> 00:36:47.580
is not helping you out.
Because by the way,
everyone knows the numbers,
right?

661
00:36:47.610 --> 00:36:50.520
So they know they're already probably know you're in dire straits and they're

662
00:36:50.521 --> 00:36:50.970
thinking,
well,

663
00:36:50.970 --> 00:36:54.060
I better find a backup job and they're going to leave and now you're an even

664
00:36:54.061 --> 00:36:58.110
worse straight.
So yeah,
absolutely.
You don't need to hide information from,

665
00:36:58.140 --> 00:37:01.680
from the team.
All right.
You know what,

666
00:37:01.681 --> 00:37:06.660
we actually have like a few questions on the muster that people asked.

667
00:37:07.170 --> 00:37:11.370
Uh,
one of them was,
one of them was,
why should I come to the master?

668
00:37:12.510 --> 00:37:17.400
What do you think?
Why should you come to the muster?

669
00:37:18.610 --> 00:37:19.170
<v 1>Okay.</v>

670
00:37:19.170 --> 00:37:22.140
<v 4>By the way,
the monster,
in case you don't know the monster's a leadership</v>

671
00:37:23.700 --> 00:37:28.410
event cause it seminar gathering,
gathering.
Oh,

672
00:37:28.440 --> 00:37:30.600
okay.
I like it.
Get with that leaders.

673
00:37:30.690 --> 00:37:35.690
So the masters or a leadership gathering where we get together and we talk about

674
00:37:36.241 --> 00:37:40.390
leadership and we have them twice a,
well this one we're having twice a year.
Uh,

675
00:37:40.440 --> 00:37:44.130
but anyways,
why should someone come to the monster?

676
00:37:45.030 --> 00:37:45.863
What do you think?

677
00:37:46.510 --> 00:37:46.960
<v 1>Okay.</v>

678
00:37:46.960 --> 00:37:49.000
<v 4>What I love about the muster is,</v>

679
00:37:50.100 --> 00:37:50.720
<v 1>okay,</v>

680
00:37:50.720 --> 00:37:54.470
<v 4>well you have to understand that we talked to hundreds of [inaudible].
We've,</v>

681
00:37:54.471 --> 00:37:55.304
we've actually worked with,

682
00:37:55.370 --> 00:37:58.730
we talked to thousands of leaders over the last six years that we've had this

683
00:37:58.731 --> 00:37:59.570
company echelon front,

684
00:37:59.870 --> 00:38:03.020
worked with hundreds of companies in at about every industry you could imagine.

685
00:38:03.290 --> 00:38:07.190
And we speak a lot of leadership conferences.
We speak at him all the time.
Uh,

686
00:38:07.370 --> 00:38:10.220
and there is nothing like the muster room.

687
00:38:10.670 --> 00:38:14.180
There just isn't anything out there like the Mussar,
nothing even comes close.

688
00:38:14.690 --> 00:38:17.000
And the reason I love it,
I'm going to,
I,

689
00:38:17.040 --> 00:38:20.930
I'm I guess get super excited to be there and be a part of that stuff.

690
00:38:21.290 --> 00:38:25.340
And I even use words like magical to describe it on previous podcasts,

691
00:38:25.341 --> 00:38:27.890
which I took some heavies for us,
it took a lot of heavies for out there.

692
00:38:27.891 --> 00:38:30.800
It was pretty magical.
I guess there were a,
there was a pretty good like Disney,

693
00:38:31.160 --> 00:38:34.240
Disney means Disney memes go in there.
That was pretty good.
But the,

694
00:38:34.250 --> 00:38:36.250
the reason the is so amazing is

695
00:38:36.940 --> 00:38:38.680
<v 2>it's just different from anything else that we do.</v>

696
00:38:38.681 --> 00:38:41.140
And I think when I think about what really makes the muster different,

697
00:38:41.141 --> 00:38:44.950
it's the people that are there.
It's the content that we're talking about.

698
00:38:44.951 --> 00:38:49.570
And it's the impact that it has.
And you know,
so who comes to the muster?

699
00:38:49.690 --> 00:38:54.690
The reason that's so awesome is that there are leaders from all over the place

700
00:38:55.180 --> 00:38:59.710
and these leaders are hell bent on dominating their universe.
I mean,

701
00:38:59.711 --> 00:39:02.920
these are people that are there.
They're in the game,
uh,

702
00:39:02.921 --> 00:39:05.320
and they're from every type of business,
every type of industry.
I mean,

703
00:39:05.321 --> 00:39:08.980
we have entrepreneurs,
we have senior executives from major companies,

704
00:39:08.981 --> 00:39:11.560
we have mid level managers,
we have frontline leaders,

705
00:39:11.561 --> 00:39:14.740
and we have people who really aren't even in a leadership position,

706
00:39:14.741 --> 00:39:18.790
maybe with no direct reports,
but are aspiring to be that way and grow and learn.

707
00:39:19.130 --> 00:39:23.800
Uh,
we get,
we get police and firefighters and other law enforcement officers,

708
00:39:24.340 --> 00:39:25.500
members of the military,

709
00:39:25.501 --> 00:39:28.990
and they're serving out there on our front lines of the home front and abroad

710
00:39:29.650 --> 00:39:33.520
and a,
these are the most committed people I've ever met.
You know,
it's,
it's,

711
00:39:33.730 --> 00:39:38.140
it's one way to quantify this or when,
when we're up in muster,

712
00:39:38.950 --> 00:39:43.660
the,
like,
the hotel staff will,
will come up and there'll be like,

713
00:39:43.690 --> 00:39:46.810
oh my God,
this is crazy.
Because for instance,

714
00:39:46.811 --> 00:39:49.930
the doors to open to actually get in the morning of the monster,

715
00:39:50.410 --> 00:39:51.940
they open at eight o'clock right?

716
00:39:51.970 --> 00:39:56.970
Or I guess seven seven 15 or seven 45 because it starts at eight seven 45 the

717
00:39:57.731 --> 00:39:59.860
doors open up and most,
I mean like you said,

718
00:39:59.861 --> 00:40:00.880
we go to these conferences all the time.

719
00:40:00.881 --> 00:40:03.220
Everyone was listening to it to some kind of conference and it's,
you know,

720
00:40:03.310 --> 00:40:05.710
people are meandering around and there are so many that blade,

721
00:40:05.711 --> 00:40:07.510
they don't really care at the muster.

722
00:40:07.690 --> 00:40:11.920
It's like the doors open at seven 45 everyone's out in the hallway and we're not

723
00:40:11.921 --> 00:40:14.410
in the hallway hanging out with everyone at you know,

724
00:40:14.650 --> 00:40:19.390
seven o'clock and that's after we do a four 45 PT in the morning.
We do,

725
00:40:19.420 --> 00:40:23.700
cause we do a little get some and that's another thing like the hotel people w

726
00:40:23.730 --> 00:40:25.780
we'll clearing it with hotel,
which is letting them know like,
hey,

727
00:40:25.781 --> 00:40:27.840
there's going to be a large gathering of people in,

728
00:40:27.940 --> 00:40:30.080
in front of the hotel in the morning.
And they're like,
well what time?

729
00:40:30.081 --> 00:40:34.160
But we were like,
oh,
four 45.
And they say,
well look,
Hey,
look how many people,

730
00:40:34.161 --> 00:40:36.280
and we're like,
well,
there's 450 people here,

731
00:40:36.281 --> 00:40:40.330
so there's going to be about 450 people here.
And sure enough,
there it is.

732
00:40:40.630 --> 00:40:43.690
And that's what the whole musters like,
oh,
we say,
hey,

733
00:40:43.691 --> 00:40:45.820
we're going to restart in 10 minutes.

734
00:40:45.850 --> 00:40:48.070
And everyone goes out and they'd come back in in 10 minutes.
Everyone seated,

735
00:40:48.090 --> 00:40:50.080
ready to rock and roll.
So that's,
that's the,
and that's,

736
00:40:50.140 --> 00:40:53.140
it's funny to hear that from an outside perspective because we're in it,

737
00:40:53.290 --> 00:40:58.090
but the hotel people always make comments about,
they say,
Hey,
we've never,

738
00:40:58.630 --> 00:40:59.860
you know,
guy will say,
Hey,
I've been,

739
00:40:59.890 --> 00:41:02.680
I've been running conferences here for 22 years.

740
00:41:02.680 --> 00:41:05.540
I've never seen a group of people like that.
So that,

741
00:41:05.560 --> 00:41:09.190
that to me shows you what kind of people show up at the muster when the,

742
00:41:09.191 --> 00:41:11.830
and when the doors open and just bum rush in there to,

743
00:41:11.831 --> 00:41:13.450
everyone wants to be in that front row.

744
00:41:13.660 --> 00:41:17.570
They're engaged and they can ask and not just so they can,
uh,
you know,

745
00:41:18.010 --> 00:41:21.390
so they can actually ask questions so they can actually engage with us.
And,

746
00:41:21.391 --> 00:41:23.110
and that's what I love about those folks.
I mean,
they just,

747
00:41:23.530 --> 00:41:25.450
they're not there to feel good about themselves,
right?

748
00:41:25.451 --> 00:41:28.610
They're there to take a hard look in the mirror and a,

749
00:41:28.611 --> 00:41:31.450
and learn and grow and get better and,
and,

750
00:41:31.451 --> 00:41:34.100
and so they can better and B be more

751
00:41:34.100 --> 00:41:37.720
<v 3>effective leaders so they can lead and win in their teams,
whatever they happen.</v>

752
00:41:37.830 --> 00:41:40.160
<v 0>You don't know.
So you just kind of talked about the,</v>

753
00:41:40.190 --> 00:41:42.780
the other question was a school comes to the monster and it's really every

754
00:41:43.100 --> 00:41:44.970
different type of leader.
The,

755
00:41:44.971 --> 00:41:49.350
another question that we got about the monster is what do we talk about at the

756
00:41:49.351 --> 00:41:52.620
muster
for

757
00:41:53.730 --> 00:41:56.670
<v 3>what,
that's the other piece that I really like about it is,
is content,
right?</v>

758
00:41:56.700 --> 00:42:00.210
It's content that,
uh,
that,
that we talk about.
And of course,

759
00:42:00.211 --> 00:42:04.080
I love telling war stories.
As you all know from the this podcast,

760
00:42:04.450 --> 00:42:05.850
we like talking about war stories,

761
00:42:05.851 --> 00:42:08.790
who'd like talking about our time and the teams.
And,
uh,
even when you just,

762
00:42:08.820 --> 00:42:11.570
you put that photo up there of,
uh,
you know,

763
00:42:11.750 --> 00:42:15.290
of Austin Ramadi from back in the day.
And I just,

764
00:42:15.330 --> 00:42:18.720
it just brings back great memories.
I mean,
those will always be,
um,

765
00:42:19.110 --> 00:42:21.780
some of the absolute best times of my life.

766
00:42:22.530 --> 00:42:26.130
Certainly some of the worst times in my life as well.
Uh,
but,
uh,

767
00:42:26.550 --> 00:42:29.090
but mostly some of the absolute best times in my life.
And,

768
00:42:29.160 --> 00:42:32.050
and so we get to talk about that,
but not just in a way that's,
that's a,

769
00:42:32.060 --> 00:42:34.410
that's a cool story.
But it has impact.
And I think taking the,

770
00:42:34.590 --> 00:42:37.560
taking the combat leadership lessons and we talk about from extreme ownership

771
00:42:37.561 --> 00:42:40.810
and applying them directly to a,
you know,
to,

772
00:42:40.820 --> 00:42:44.670
to people's lives and what they do and how to overcome their challenges.

773
00:42:45.360 --> 00:42:50.040
That's what it's about.
It's,
it's super engaging.
Uh,
and for us,
you know,
for,

774
00:42:50.100 --> 00:42:50.980
for me and jog,

775
00:42:51.140 --> 00:42:55.020
this isn't a standard leadership conference where there's like 40 different

776
00:42:55.021 --> 00:42:58.560
speakers and the,
the main folks kind of get up there and spend a few hours.

777
00:42:58.561 --> 00:43:01.740
I mean we're,
we're there the whole time and we're there to engage with leaders.

778
00:43:01.950 --> 00:43:04.350
It's me,
it's Jocko,
it's Dave Burke,

779
00:43:04.351 --> 00:43:09.120
it's JP Denelle from our echelon front team were there were the guys on stage

780
00:43:09.210 --> 00:43:10.650
and even during the breaks,

781
00:43:10.651 --> 00:43:13.130
we're talking to leaders that are coming up and asking questions.
We're,

782
00:43:13.131 --> 00:43:16.920
we're engaging with them.
No green and Q and.
A,
there isn't a green room.

783
00:43:16.921 --> 00:43:18.990
There isn't someplace where hiding behind the curtain,
there isn't.

784
00:43:18.991 --> 00:43:23.160
Somewhere in the back were Lafe is getting a cucumber is put on his eyes,

785
00:43:24.480 --> 00:43:25.980
take a load off sir,

786
00:43:26.820 --> 00:43:31.680
sipping a sipping my Jocko white tea pinky look I,
and that's,

787
00:43:31.970 --> 00:43:32.461
you know,
these,

788
00:43:32.461 --> 00:43:35.850
these folks are there to get their questions answered and to ask hard questions.

789
00:43:36.390 --> 00:43:40.440
<v 0>The thing that you really,
we really get granular on a lot and that's,</v>

790
00:43:40.530 --> 00:43:44.550
that's what it is.
You're taking like,
you understand the principles.
It's like,

791
00:43:44.970 --> 00:43:45.870
it's like learning a,

792
00:43:45.880 --> 00:43:50.880
a Jujitsu move from one person and they teach you a fundamental basic move and

793
00:43:52.891 --> 00:43:57.480
you're like,
okay,
I understand that.
And then compared to,
okay,
now you're getting,

794
00:43:57.481 --> 00:44:00.420
getting a private lesson.
Like that's like an a class,
right?
Hey,

795
00:44:00.421 --> 00:44:01.254
this is the arm lock.

796
00:44:01.410 --> 00:44:06.240
Then you get a private lesson with someone that goes in and adapts the technique

797
00:44:06.241 --> 00:44:09.390
to your body style,
to the opponents that you're facing,

798
00:44:09.570 --> 00:44:12.750
the adjustments that you need to make.
That's the kind of granularity we get.

799
00:44:12.751 --> 00:44:15.510
Cause the,
the,
the,
the more you see these different angles.

800
00:44:15.511 --> 00:44:17.630
And the other great thing is because with all these different people that you

801
00:44:17.631 --> 00:44:17.881
got there,

802
00:44:17.881 --> 00:44:22.830
and we do group exercises where now you're sitting down and we purposely don't

803
00:44:22.831 --> 00:44:25.650
want people to sit with,
with industries that they already work with.

804
00:44:25.650 --> 00:44:30.180
So in one group you'll get a,
a CEO,
you'll get a firefighter,

805
00:44:30.300 --> 00:44:33.900
you'll get a startup business owner,

806
00:44:34.050 --> 00:44:36.720
you'll get a mid level manager and you'll get it some,
you know,

807
00:44:36.850 --> 00:44:40.140
regular corporate EVP and they'll all be sitting at the same table.

808
00:44:40.740 --> 00:44:42.570
And we will give them a problem.

809
00:44:42.571 --> 00:44:45.900
We'll give him a task and they'll come up with a solution and they'll relate it

810
00:44:45.901 --> 00:44:47.760
to how it affects their lives and their business.

811
00:44:47.820 --> 00:44:52.820
And when you see stuff from different angles like that and you're all applying,

812
00:44:52.861 --> 00:44:54.240
we're all speaking the same language because everyone,

813
00:44:54.241 --> 00:44:55.900
there's obviously read the book,
everyone understands that.

814
00:44:56.070 --> 00:44:57.960
Everyone understands fundamentally what the principles are.

815
00:44:58.140 --> 00:45:02.550
But now we're getting to see how they impact people's businesses and lives and

816
00:45:02.551 --> 00:45:05.070
leadership roles from all these different perspectives.

817
00:45:05.071 --> 00:45:09.000
And it just makes you that much better.
That's why during these exercises,

818
00:45:09.690 --> 00:45:12.390
like I'll,
I'll say,
oh come to float around to these different tables and listen,

819
00:45:12.540 --> 00:45:15.270
but the first day,
but I'll get to,
I'll be like,
oh man,
these guys are your,

820
00:45:15.480 --> 00:45:17.460
I'm sitting there learning cause you got,
like I said,

821
00:45:17.461 --> 00:45:22.050
you've got a firefighter that's explaining to a CEO what you do in a situation

822
00:45:22.170 --> 00:45:27.090
where your team has decided that they're not gonna follow this procedure anymore

823
00:45:27.150 --> 00:45:31.920
and they have good reason why they don't want to.
Like it's one thing when your,

824
00:45:32.040 --> 00:45:34.620
when your team doesn't follow the procedure and you say,
Hey,

825
00:45:34.621 --> 00:45:37.350
you got to follow this procedure and you,
and they say,
well why?

826
00:45:37.351 --> 00:45:39.750
And you say you explain it to them and they go,
oh okay,
that makes sense.

827
00:45:39.751 --> 00:45:43.380
But what about when you tell them to follow the procedure and they have a reason

828
00:45:43.381 --> 00:45:45.960
that actually makes sense,
then what are you going to do?
Well,

829
00:45:45.961 --> 00:45:47.430
that's what you learned at that,
at the muster.

830
00:45:47.760 --> 00:45:50.910
That's where you make the progress.
So that's good.

831
00:45:51.090 --> 00:45:53.590
One last question that we got about the,

832
00:45:53.600 --> 00:45:58.600
the muster is what kind of impact do you see from people that have been to the

833
00:45:59.551 --> 00:46:00.384
muster?

834
00:46:01.560 --> 00:46:02.840
<v 3>The impact is uh,</v>

835
00:46:02.900 --> 00:46:07.900
is is obvious in that the number of people who are there that are talking about

836
00:46:09.961 --> 00:46:14.540
how they just got promoted or are they just got put in this,
in this position,
uh,

837
00:46:14.541 --> 00:46:18.990
have greater responsibility and a and authority,
uh,
on their teams are,

838
00:46:18.991 --> 00:46:20.880
they've been recognized for their exceptional performance?

839
00:46:20.881 --> 00:46:23.450
Are The folks who've cove who've come back from that and we hear about it on

840
00:46:23.460 --> 00:46:27.390
social media or reach out to us via email or come back to a muster to talk about

841
00:46:27.391 --> 00:46:29.670
that from what they,
you know,
what had happened to them previously?

842
00:46:30.090 --> 00:46:34.410
The number of leaders who come and see what we're doing and bring their teams.

843
00:46:34.660 --> 00:46:37.660
That's what's pretty awesome too.
I mean that to me when a,
when a,

844
00:46:37.680 --> 00:46:42.110
when a CEO from a company comes,
checks out what we're doing,
uh,

845
00:46:42.111 --> 00:46:45.170
and brings 25 of his to his team members back,
uh,

846
00:46:45.240 --> 00:46:47.340
to be a part of that because he recognizes the impact that,

847
00:46:47.341 --> 00:46:50.580
that can have a to his,
to his team and we'll have,
and it's just,

848
00:46:50.880 --> 00:46:53.640
it's awesome to see that.
I mean,
these are the most,
again,

849
00:46:53.670 --> 00:46:56.040
the most committed people you could ever be around.
And they just,

850
00:46:56.160 --> 00:46:59.820
they leave there with the knowledge to directly apply things to solve problems,

851
00:47:00.200 --> 00:47:04.010
uh,
and they learn from us.
They learned from each other just as you said.
Uh,

852
00:47:04.060 --> 00:47:04.891
and part of that too,

853
00:47:04.891 --> 00:47:09.390
I think there's a recognition that these kinds of problems that I'm having are

854
00:47:09.391 --> 00:47:12.210
not unique to me.
They're not unique to the market that I'm in.

855
00:47:12.211 --> 00:47:16.110
They're not unique to my industry,
but their leadership problems and they,

856
00:47:16.111 --> 00:47:17.940
and they apply everywhere.
Uh,

857
00:47:17.941 --> 00:47:22.650
and I'm trying to get a diverse group of people to focus their efforts to,
uh,

858
00:47:22.651 --> 00:47:25.800
and mutual support one another or accomplish a mission just like everybody else

859
00:47:25.810 --> 00:47:30.240
in every other industry.
In the,
in the business world as a first responder,

860
00:47:30.250 --> 00:47:33.210
the military doesn't matter.
It's the same thing.
Uh,

861
00:47:33.310 --> 00:47:37.690
and the same techniques apply everywhere.
And it just,
uh,
that's why it's awesome.

862
00:47:37.691 --> 00:47:42.650
I love the muster and,
and I,
I can't wait.
I can't wait to meet those folks.
Uh,

863
00:47:42.700 --> 00:47:46.420
and uh,
and that's why so many people come back again and again and again.

864
00:47:46.421 --> 00:47:48.820
And it's just a,
it's just an awesome event.

865
00:47:49.030 --> 00:47:52.090
It's the best thing that there were a part of.
And a,
and frankly,

866
00:47:52.091 --> 00:47:54.130
if you don't want to have that good look in the mirror,
that hard,

867
00:47:54.131 --> 00:47:56.920
look in the mirror at yourself and have answer some tough questions about where

868
00:47:56.921 --> 00:48:00.670
you can do better,
you probably shouldn't come because it's not for you.
It's a,

869
00:48:00.671 --> 00:48:01.630
it's for people who are,

870
00:48:01.930 --> 00:48:06.490
are eager to destroy their competition and dominate the universe.

871
00:48:06.520 --> 00:48:09.940
And that starts with looking at themselves and taking ownership in solving

872
00:48:09.941 --> 00:48:11.710
problems so they can win.

873
00:48:11.780 --> 00:48:15.350
<v 0>Yeah,
it's,
it's interesting cause if you think about it,</v>

874
00:48:15.440 --> 00:48:16.790
I was talking about this yesterday,

875
00:48:16.850 --> 00:48:21.850
like every problem that you have in an organization is going to be solved by

876
00:48:22.311 --> 00:48:24.800
leadership.
That that's it.
That's it.
That's what it's gonna get solved by.

877
00:48:24.950 --> 00:48:28.310
Every problem that is in an organization is going to be solved by leadership.

878
00:48:28.550 --> 00:48:30.110
I don't care if it's cause you're missing numbers.

879
00:48:30.111 --> 00:48:31.310
I don't care if you've got bad process.

880
00:48:31.311 --> 00:48:33.350
I don't care if you've got brown people in the wrong positions.

881
00:48:34.120 --> 00:48:37.340
All of those problems are all about leadership because if you've got a bad

882
00:48:37.341 --> 00:48:40.220
process,
there's a leader that's allowing that process to be in place.

883
00:48:40.310 --> 00:48:43.880
If you've got bad people,
then there's a leader that's not either training.

884
00:48:43.881 --> 00:48:47.360
Those people are getting rid of those people.
And if your P and l is upside down,

885
00:48:47.420 --> 00:48:49.490
there's a leader that is not paying attention to the numbers.

886
00:48:49.550 --> 00:48:51.290
So all of these problems are going to be used to prompt.

887
00:48:51.291 --> 00:48:53.300
So if you want to improve your business,

888
00:48:53.330 --> 00:48:55.040
well then what you needed to do is improve your leadership.

889
00:48:55.760 --> 00:48:57.320
Now I will say this as well.

890
00:48:57.321 --> 00:49:00.740
I just gotta make like a little caveat here cause you just talked about the

891
00:49:00.741 --> 00:49:01.574
value of it.

892
00:49:01.730 --> 00:49:05.450
If you're out there in the world and you can't afford to come to the monster,

893
00:49:05.451 --> 00:49:08.450
which I understand the monsters is expensive.
It costs us a lot to put together.

894
00:49:08.630 --> 00:49:11.450
I had somebody hit me up like,
hey,

895
00:49:11.510 --> 00:49:14.960
it sounds like you care but more about making money.
I was like,
no,
no,

896
00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:17.080
we definitely want to make money.
That's what,

897
00:49:17.090 --> 00:49:20.180
that's what we our business and we need to make money and we need to pay our

898
00:49:20.181 --> 00:49:23.570
team and so yeah,
we are.
We are going to make money and the monster is expensive.

899
00:49:23.630 --> 00:49:26.030
It costs a lot of money.
If you can't afford to come to the monster,

900
00:49:27.530 --> 00:49:29.570
don't come to the muster.
If you can't,

901
00:49:29.750 --> 00:49:33.380
don't go out and borrow money to come to the muster.
No,
you,
you,
you're not,

902
00:49:33.830 --> 00:49:36.920
you know,
don't skip a mortgage payment so you can come to the muster.

903
00:49:36.921 --> 00:49:40.940
That's not a good idea.
What you do is you implement some financial discipline.

904
00:49:40.970 --> 00:49:43.880
You start saving money,
you put it together and you can come to the next muster.

905
00:49:44.720 --> 00:49:47.420
By the way,
if you can't afford the muster,

906
00:49:47.790 --> 00:49:52.430
you can get a book called extreme ownership.
It costs 1697 on Amazon.

907
00:49:52.910 --> 00:49:55.490
That's fine.
We,
this podcast is free.

908
00:49:55.850 --> 00:50:00.140
There's 400 something hours of us talking about this kind of thing.

909
00:50:00.350 --> 00:50:04.850
So you can do that.
Like I said,
if you can come to the monster,

910
00:50:04.880 --> 00:50:07.730
that's when you're going to get basically a private jujitsu lesson.

911
00:50:07.760 --> 00:50:09.530
You're going to learn really granular things.

912
00:50:09.531 --> 00:50:11.330
You're going to get the interaction face to face.

913
00:50:11.331 --> 00:50:13.940
You're going to have to ask the specific questions about your world and you're

914
00:50:13.941 --> 00:50:17.030
going to interact with people that are on the same path as you.
That's awesome.

915
00:50:17.990 --> 00:50:19.490
If you can come,
come,
we'll,

916
00:50:19.491 --> 00:50:24.491
we'll see you at the muster that no green room thing and we've talked about that

917
00:50:24.621 --> 00:50:28.340
before.
But that's,
that's a big deal.
It's a bigger than it might seem

918
00:50:28.760 --> 00:50:33.340
<v 5>because you know how like how you said like,
okay,
you have a Q and a part or um,</v>

919
00:50:33.470 --> 00:50:35.570
you know,
like you have a,
you have a specific question.
Like,
hey,

920
00:50:35.600 --> 00:50:37.580
that was cool what you just said,
but what about the,
you know,

921
00:50:37.581 --> 00:50:39.050
like some people have questions.

922
00:50:39.590 --> 00:50:44.510
So during the break when most times I get these conventions and whatever,

923
00:50:44.511 --> 00:50:46.820
they got the,
you know,
the people,
they'll,
they'll say their,

924
00:50:46.821 --> 00:50:47.660
what they have to send them,

925
00:50:47.661 --> 00:50:50.840
they'll go and they'll disappear straight up district newcomers on their eyes,

926
00:50:51.290 --> 00:50:56.000
whatever,
grapes,
whatever.
And um,
but here it's like people are like,
Hey,

927
00:50:56.001 --> 00:50:59.780
that question that I had,
now I can go run and go,
go grab,

928
00:50:59.781 --> 00:51:02.240
lay for duck or whatever and ask it like personally,

929
00:51:02.850 --> 00:51:06.670
it's what we have when during the break Lafe and I were on stage.
Yeah.

930
00:51:07.280 --> 00:51:08.810
With a break we say,
okay,
take a break,

931
00:51:08.870 --> 00:51:12.650
come back in 12 minutes we stepped down off the stage and we stand right there

932
00:51:12.740 --> 00:51:15.920
and people just come and ask us more questions and we continued talking and

933
00:51:15.921 --> 00:51:17.780
sometimes somebody has such a good question and we're like,

934
00:51:17.781 --> 00:51:19.820
bring it back and we'll get back on stage and say,
hey,

935
00:51:19.821 --> 00:51:22.370
someone just asked this question.
Here's the question.
It's a great question.

936
00:51:22.371 --> 00:51:25.240
You know,
it's a problem time.
Yeah.
The whole time.
The whole time.
Yeah.
Yeah.

937
00:51:25.300 --> 00:51:26.150
Even looking in the,

938
00:51:26.500 --> 00:51:29.340
and this would happen to me a lot for some reason they think I know,

939
00:51:29.360 --> 00:51:30.710
well I guess I kind of know a little bit,

940
00:51:30.711 --> 00:51:33.440
but I'm going to ask you to the leadership questions always in the game,

941
00:51:33.441 --> 00:51:37.010
like in the hallway and he said the best thing to do in that situation and you

942
00:51:37.011 --> 00:51:38.550
want to just kind of,
cause

943
00:51:40.250 --> 00:51:43.460
I was going to say that's one of the other primaries to come to musters Echo

944
00:51:43.460 --> 00:51:45.300
Charles is going to be there one of these days.

945
00:51:45.301 --> 00:51:49.460
We're going to get you on stage for a keynote presentation and it's going to be

946
00:51:49.461 --> 00:51:53.630
awesome.
Yeah.
You gotta to be right,
right in your comfort zone.
Getting flanked.

947
00:51:54.270 --> 00:51:57.740
All right,
moving on.
That was the three questions about the muster,

948
00:51:58.010 --> 00:51:59.990
but they got asked.
So here,

949
00:52:02.150 --> 00:52:07.100
knowing what you know about war and the teams,
if you could go back in time,

950
00:52:07.101 --> 00:52:08.120
what would you have done differently?

951
00:52:10.330 --> 00:52:14.400
<v 3>Man,
I wish I could go back in time day.
Burke and I were doing an event</v>

952
00:52:16.020 --> 00:52:20.470
earlier this week and he was,
he,
he,
he said,
uh,
you know,

953
00:52:20.471 --> 00:52:24.310
I'm glad I'm not in Ramadi.
I know lave probably wished he was everybody 100%.

954
00:52:24.311 --> 00:52:28.340
I would go there right now,
let's go and look.

955
00:52:28.390 --> 00:52:32.560
It's what I would do differently is the recognition that,
uh,

956
00:52:33.340 --> 00:52:37.210
we were super aggressive.
We took a lot of risk.
Um,

957
00:52:38.620 --> 00:52:42.490
what I would do differently is I would actually be even more aggressive.

958
00:52:42.520 --> 00:52:45.940
I would be a hundred times more aggressive.
I would be putting up,
you know,

959
00:52:46.210 --> 00:52:48.400
a concept of operations brief for your,

960
00:52:48.430 --> 00:52:53.430
for your approval to send up the chain to swim across the river and hit targets

961
00:52:54.041 --> 00:52:55.150
and,
and,
and,
you know,

962
00:52:55.420 --> 00:53:00.420
put in some cyber Overwatch's and just completely ruined the bad guys program

963
00:53:01.120 --> 00:53:02.320
going on in south central.
My,

964
00:53:02.321 --> 00:53:05.350
when they had complete freedom movement before they had any expectation that we

965
00:53:05.351 --> 00:53:07.820
could be there before he met could get to us.
And I think,
uh,

966
00:53:07.900 --> 00:53:10.420
they would never see it coming,
which means that,
uh,

967
00:53:10.421 --> 00:53:13.840
we would have more impact and it would actually be safer for us,
uh,

968
00:53:13.841 --> 00:53:16.150
because they wouldn't expect back in it.
So they would probably hammers.

969
00:53:16.151 --> 00:53:19.770
But we recognize that we could get away with a lot more.
Um,
you know,

970
00:53:19.870 --> 00:53:23.080
then we could,
uh,
and looking back on it,
I just,
when you,

971
00:53:23.081 --> 00:53:24.460
when you come into an area and they're like,
hey,

972
00:53:24.461 --> 00:53:26.100
don't go and you're all going to get killed,
he,

973
00:53:26.390 --> 00:53:30.120
<v 2>you want to be cautious.
You want to,
you don't want to just jump into things.</v>

974
00:53:30.121 --> 00:53:32.490
You want to mitigate risk and control.
Certainly.
Uh,

975
00:53:32.491 --> 00:53:37.230
but we recognize we could get away with a lot more than we thought we could and

976
00:53:37.290 --> 00:53:39.300
more often than not bring,
bring guys at home.
And of course,

977
00:53:39.301 --> 00:53:41.940
that's the one that I would change.
Obviously if I could change,
if,
uh,

978
00:53:42.300 --> 00:53:46.590
I would trade places with Mark Lee and Ryan,
Joe in my platoon in a second,

979
00:53:47.010 --> 00:53:50.400
uh,
I'd trade places with Mike Monsoor and Delta platoon in a second.

980
00:53:50.430 --> 00:53:54.120
And I wish I could do that and I can't,
but,
uh,
that is,
uh,

981
00:53:54.360 --> 00:53:58.200
that is what I would change.
Um,
but,
uh,
I certainly would,

982
00:53:58.350 --> 00:53:59.670
if we could go back there again,

983
00:53:59.671 --> 00:54:02.910
we would be even more aggressive and we'd have even more impact.

984
00:54:03.840 --> 00:54:06.690
There's a term that they used to say in the teams.

985
00:54:06.690 --> 00:54:07.650
I don't know if you ever heard,

986
00:54:07.710 --> 00:54:11.880
you probably did when we'd be doing special reconnaissance training and guys

987
00:54:11.881 --> 00:54:14.370
would say trust your camouflage.
Did you ever hear that expression?

988
00:54:15.090 --> 00:54:16.770
You may not have.
I don't.
I don't believe so.

989
00:54:16.771 --> 00:54:21.771
So what it was was when you got good at putting your camouflage together,

990
00:54:21.960 --> 00:54:25.590
you could really get aggressive in getting up and observing a target.

991
00:54:26.100 --> 00:54:27.660
Because if you trust your camera,

992
00:54:27.661 --> 00:54:31.250
if you've done a good job with your Cammie paint,
your Ghillie suit and d and,

993
00:54:31.340 --> 00:54:34.530
and putting yourself together,
well the enemy's not going to be able to see you.

994
00:54:34.740 --> 00:54:36.780
But it's really weird to be,
you know,

995
00:54:36.930 --> 00:54:40.050
40 meters from a target that you're looking at.

996
00:54:40.180 --> 00:54:43.530
Then there's a guy walking around and you feel completely naked.

997
00:54:43.531 --> 00:54:46.230
Like they can see what they can't see you at all.
They can't see you at all.

998
00:54:46.380 --> 00:54:50.310
And so it takes some,
it takes some time to learn to trust your camouflage.

999
00:54:50.770 --> 00:54:53.790
And I think,
you know,
obviously hindsight is 2020.

1000
00:54:53.880 --> 00:54:57.390
And when you look back at your Mati like you look back and you think to
yourself,

1001
00:54:57.391 --> 00:54:58.890
what,
we could've done this and we could have done that.

1002
00:54:58.891 --> 00:55:00.240
We could have gotten closer to that target,

1003
00:55:00.241 --> 00:55:03.000
we could have done more things because our hindsight is 2020.

1004
00:55:03.001 --> 00:55:05.860
And also we learned over time to trust our camouflage.

1005
00:55:05.861 --> 00:55:10.020
And the longer we were there,
the the,
the more aggressive,
you know,

1006
00:55:10.200 --> 00:55:12.720
operations took place.
But yeah,
that's,

1007
00:55:13.310 --> 00:55:17.430
hindsight's 2020 isn't it?
That it is.

1008
00:55:19.320 --> 00:55:20.153
Okay.

1009
00:55:22.290 --> 00:55:25.110
Advice on restarting your life after the military.

1010
00:55:29.150 --> 00:55:30.940
I think you just got to figure out what you want to do.
Yeah.

1011
00:55:31.010 --> 00:55:31.860
You got to figure out what you want to.

1012
00:55:31.870 --> 00:55:34.050
I have a new mantra that I tell people now it's,
it's,
uh,

1013
00:55:34.700 --> 00:55:37.210
find your next mission and that's what you gotta do.
And I got,

1014
00:55:37.260 --> 00:55:42.260
I got really lucky because got right into this and you use the same thing.

1015
00:55:42.890 --> 00:55:45.230
Like we,
we went right into a new mission.

1016
00:55:45.500 --> 00:55:49.850
And so any time to kind of wander around and look around and figure out which

1017
00:55:49.851 --> 00:55:51.230
direction to go.
And by the way,

1018
00:55:51.350 --> 00:55:53.600
when you're wandering around and looking around to find out which direction to

1019
00:55:53.601 --> 00:55:53.990
go,

1020
00:55:53.990 --> 00:55:56.410
you're going to get pulled in a direction and that direction is probably going

1021
00:55:56.411 --> 00:55:58.730
to be the path of least resistance.
It's not going to be a good path.

1022
00:55:59.300 --> 00:56:03.920
We certainly know it's not going to be the path.
So when you come out,

1023
00:56:03.980 --> 00:56:05.300
when you get out of the military man,

1024
00:56:05.301 --> 00:56:07.580
have a mission to figure out what your next mission is going to be.
But I,

1025
00:56:07.590 --> 00:56:11.690
I would disagree with you there and that it wasn't that we'd got lucky right in

1026
00:56:11.691 --> 00:56:13.700
that and that if you think about what we're doing now,

1027
00:56:13.760 --> 00:56:17.210
this is what we like to do.
And this is what we,
we,
uh,

1028
00:56:17.211 --> 00:56:20.210
we brought lessons back from Marty that we,
uh,

1029
00:56:20.270 --> 00:56:24.220
we translating and gave to the next generation seals and,
and saw

1030
00:56:24.220 --> 00:56:27.130
<v 4>the impact that was out.
I mean,
when you,
when you came back from my,</v>

1031
00:56:27.131 --> 00:56:30.220
you could have any,
any job that you want to do and you said,

1032
00:56:30.221 --> 00:56:33.460
I want to go run trying to attachment because I want to make sure that the,

1033
00:56:33.730 --> 00:56:35.150
the next,
uh,

1034
00:56:35.200 --> 00:56:37.630
seals that are coming through this training and going forward to places like

1035
00:56:37.631 --> 00:56:40.600
Iraq or Afghanistan or ready,
uh,
you chose to do that.

1036
00:56:40.640 --> 00:56:43.420
And I was running a training program that that's,
I would,

1037
00:56:43.421 --> 00:56:45.310
I didn't want to be anywhere else in that.
It was awesome.

1038
00:56:45.490 --> 00:56:48.070
And I recognize how powerful that was.
Uh,
and,

1039
00:56:48.071 --> 00:56:51.370
and the kind of reward it brought to me to see these young officers go out there

1040
00:56:51.371 --> 00:56:54.400
that I put the training and,
and succeed on,
on incredibly difficult,

1041
00:56:54.610 --> 00:56:58.440
dangerous battlefields in different areas that,
that I'd been to.
So,
you know,
we,

1042
00:56:58.441 --> 00:57:02.860
we took that and recognize that this is something that,
that,
that,
uh,
is useful,

1043
00:57:02.861 --> 00:57:06.700
it has impact and that we can do for others.
So I think that's,

1044
00:57:07.060 --> 00:57:10.810
it was absolutely not the path of least resistance.
And I got,
you know,

1045
00:57:10.811 --> 00:57:11.920
we had job offers,

1046
00:57:12.010 --> 00:57:15.730
offers that people thought people thought I was completely crazy,

1047
00:57:16.060 --> 00:57:17.920
a buddy of mine.
I was like,
come work for me,

1048
00:57:18.070 --> 00:57:22.210
we'll pay you this huge salary that was triple and what my navy salary was.

1049
00:57:22.520 --> 00:57:25.690
And I said,
I'm not going to do that.
I'm going to start my own business.
I mean,

1050
00:57:25.691 --> 00:57:27.430
he looked at me like I was nuts.
Yeah.

1051
00:57:27.431 --> 00:57:30.160
We were talking about yesterday because we weren't making a lot of money at the

1052
00:57:30.161 --> 00:57:34.510
beginning of echelon front.
Now where were we?
We were,
we,
we,

1053
00:57:34.660 --> 00:57:36.010
we had to put together,

1054
00:57:36.011 --> 00:57:41.011
we were writing checks and paying for things and traveling on her own dime to,

1055
00:57:41.051 --> 00:57:44.920
to go and talk to companies and for free,
for free or for almost nothing.

1056
00:57:45.700 --> 00:57:48.340
And I think that's the,
and that's really it is,
is finding your mission.

1057
00:57:48.340 --> 00:57:51.190
Like this is what I can do a,
and this is,

1058
00:57:51.220 --> 00:57:53.530
this is what I liked to do and,

1059
00:57:53.531 --> 00:57:56.620
and I'm going to figure out a way to do something that is useful.

1060
00:57:56.621 --> 00:57:58.690
It impacts people.
Uh,
and I think that's,

1061
00:57:58.720 --> 00:58:02.920
that's a real key is fine to the next mission.
For sure.
Next question.

1062
00:58:02.950 --> 00:58:03.880
I like this question.

1063
00:58:04.050 --> 00:58:09.050
This question made me think that whoever wrote this question has a good feel for

1064
00:58:09.540 --> 00:58:12.190
like kind of the whole thing here.
So the question was,

1065
00:58:12.680 --> 00:58:13.940
he said this question to leaf,

1066
00:58:14.080 --> 00:58:19.080
what's Jockos most impactful strategy on you when he says life gets real fired

1067
00:58:22.091 --> 00:58:22.924
up?

1068
00:58:24.430 --> 00:58:27.700
Definitely someone who's been listening to a lot of podcasts or maybe he's

1069
00:58:27.701 --> 00:58:28.620
coming to the muster.
I heard,

1070
00:58:28.690 --> 00:58:33.300
heard us speak or top before cause Jocko talks about angry lavey late and it

1071
00:58:33.301 --> 00:58:36.400
really,
I can get angry.
That's psychotic,
right?

1072
00:58:36.430 --> 00:58:39.420
Basically be a little bit of a hothead.
I can definitely be a hothead.

1073
00:58:39.430 --> 00:58:43.480
He can be a lot of bit of audit.
Sometimes I can't and usually,
I mean I,
I uh,

1074
00:58:43.630 --> 00:58:47.020
I'd like to think that it takes me,
uh,
I,
I don't immediately spit up on things,

1075
00:58:47.021 --> 00:58:50.470
but once I get spun off I get,
I get really spun off.
And uh,

1076
00:58:50.590 --> 00:58:53.280
I don't know if you disagree with,
no,
no,
no.

1077
00:58:53.310 --> 00:58:58.190
I was going to ask you is how has having two kids for sure that,

1078
00:58:58.191 --> 00:59:01.970
that that teaches you some temper control?
Big Time,
big time.
And it,

1079
00:59:02.000 --> 00:59:04.330
and particularly when,
you know,
when,
when there's,

1080
00:59:04.331 --> 00:59:06.970
there's timelines that you're trying to meet and we're trying to run a business.

1081
00:59:07.960 --> 00:59:10.960
They don't,
cause they don't,
they just do.
The timeline is now,

1082
00:59:11.260 --> 00:59:13.400
I want some crayons now.
And what I've,

1083
00:59:13.420 --> 00:59:17.590
what I've loved is that I love spending time with my son and uh,
and,

1084
00:59:17.591 --> 00:59:20.230
and my daughter,
and they're awesome kids in particular.
My son now he's three,

1085
00:59:20.231 --> 00:59:22.040
he's old enough to kind of,
you know,
he,
he's

1086
00:59:22.040 --> 00:59:23.870
<v 3>in the game.
Yeah,
we'll go,
we'll go somewhere,</v>

1087
00:59:23.880 --> 00:59:26.270
do something fun or are we're hanging out.

1088
00:59:26.271 --> 00:59:29.150
And it doesn't matter if that's five minutes long or five hours long,

1089
00:59:29.151 --> 00:59:33.800
like when it's time to leave,
it's level 19 meltdown every time.

1090
00:59:33.890 --> 00:59:37.910
Right.
And He,
I,
I'm waiting for the time.
He was like,
Dad,
thank you for the time.

1091
00:59:37.911 --> 00:59:41.210
This is really fun.
It doesn't happen.
So,
so yeah,
that,

1092
00:59:41.211 --> 00:59:45.620
that actually instills in you some,
uh,
some patients,
some patients,
but it's the,

1093
00:59:45.680 --> 00:59:49.460
we always talk about red flags and that's something that I learned from you.
Um,

1094
00:59:49.550 --> 00:59:52.550
and that,
uh,
and I know you were looking at for me to see like,

1095
00:59:52.580 --> 00:59:53.930
oh some red flags are going off,

1096
00:59:54.110 --> 00:59:58.460
red flags are those things that as you talked about often you recognize in

1097
00:59:58.461 --> 01:00:01.040
yourself like okay I'm getting spun up right now.

1098
01:00:01.190 --> 01:00:05.030
I need to take a step back here and and throttled back.

1099
01:00:05.180 --> 01:00:07.340
I knew throttled back here cause I'm getting spun up.
So,

1100
01:00:07.341 --> 01:00:11.090
so with kids I got to look at it as you know what this is good cause cause I

1101
01:00:11.091 --> 01:00:13.880
know that's something that I,
it's in my nature that I can get spun up.

1102
01:00:13.881 --> 01:00:17.480
So with kids I got to relish that opportunity to say this is a training

1103
01:00:17.481 --> 01:00:20.570
opportunity for me to be outside of my comfort zone and just say,

1104
01:00:20.571 --> 01:00:22.940
Oh you know what?
I feel myself getting spun up.

1105
01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:25.510
I'm going to practice detaching and spinning down and not,

1106
01:00:25.610 --> 01:00:27.860
not reacting in a way that I might otherwise would have.

1107
01:00:28.200 --> 01:00:32.480
And I think it's a great,
it's a great tool there really for,
for me,
I think the,

1108
01:00:33.110 --> 01:00:34.730
when Jocko would since that in me,

1109
01:00:34.760 --> 01:00:37.640
and we've talked about a number of times when that's happened here on the

1110
01:00:37.641 --> 01:00:42.200
podcast that I was getting spun up,
you know,
we talked about,
you know,
previous,

1111
01:00:42.610 --> 01:00:43.270
uh,
in,
in,

1112
01:00:43.270 --> 01:00:46.400
in previous podcasts about cancel the op and some of these things where I,

1113
01:00:46.410 --> 01:00:50.870
you know,
I just,
uh,
I would,
I would get fired relief and get angry and,

1114
01:00:50.900 --> 01:00:53.570
and you,
what most people would have done in that situation,

1115
01:00:53.571 --> 01:00:56.570
what I probably would have done to a subordinate leader is get is,

1116
01:00:57.380 --> 01:00:59.330
is gets spun up as well.

1117
01:00:59.450 --> 01:01:02.840
And like you yell at me now I'm going to yell at you but a little bit louder.

1118
01:01:03.080 --> 01:01:04.850
Exactly.
And how we're going to ramp up.

1119
01:01:04.851 --> 01:01:07.460
And it becomes like the battle of wills and,
and how you,

1120
01:01:07.461 --> 01:01:10.580
how you handled that exceptionally well with me was generally you would,

1121
01:01:10.690 --> 01:01:11.930
what you would never get spun up.

1122
01:01:11.950 --> 01:01:16.160
He would just be very calm and your response and you would ask questions or in

1123
01:01:16.161 --> 01:01:20.480
some cases you would just start chuckling like,
like laughing about it.
Like,

1124
01:01:20.481 --> 01:01:24.320
Hey man,
you get smart and not,
not in a way that it was condescending or like,
oh,

1125
01:01:24.321 --> 01:01:25.500
look at you.
You idiot.
Yeah.

1126
01:01:25.580 --> 01:01:28.040
It was in a way of going to laugh at people when they're getting mad.

1127
01:01:28.130 --> 01:01:32.750
It was in a wheel that,
hey man,
take it easy.
Yeah,
just take it easy.

1128
01:01:32.810 --> 01:01:35.330
And then you start laughing at anybody.
It was,
and then it just,

1129
01:01:35.331 --> 01:01:39.050
that was something that was,
what would you ask questions in a way that were,
hey,

1130
01:01:39.080 --> 01:01:42.560
well why,
why do you think this are those things?

1131
01:01:42.560 --> 01:01:45.800
That was powerful as well to me that wasn't,
it wasn't a like,
hey,

1132
01:01:46.280 --> 01:01:48.680
why are you doing this?
Or why won't you listen to me?
And it was,

1133
01:01:49.010 --> 01:01:52.700
that always allowed me to Kinda take a step back and recognize,
okay,
so,

1134
01:01:52.701 --> 01:01:54.860
so I think you,
you've got to make sure you see a red flag.

1135
01:01:54.861 --> 01:01:57.320
If somebody else they're getting spun up and they're really emotional,

1136
01:01:57.560 --> 01:01:59.440
you need to be unemotional and you need to,

1137
01:01:59.690 --> 01:02:02.240
you need to check your ego to do an end around,

1138
01:02:02.360 --> 01:02:04.400
I'd never see anybody do that before.

1139
01:02:04.640 --> 01:02:07.640
You do that exceptionally well a against me.
And uh,

1140
01:02:07.880 --> 01:02:10.460
and I learned a lot from that because I recognize like I got to do that better

1141
01:02:10.730 --> 01:02:14.020
and it never,
it just doesn't benefit you from getting spun up and angry.
And,

1142
01:02:14.050 --> 01:02:15.200
and I'll tell you one thing,

1143
01:02:15.201 --> 01:02:20.070
that's another little thing that I noticed that I do for sure is

1144
01:02:20.130 --> 01:02:22.830
<v 0>if someone comes at me and they're super mad about something,</v>

1145
01:02:23.880 --> 01:02:27.150
I can't just be a hundred percent calm.
Cause if,

1146
01:02:27.170 --> 01:02:30.240
if you come in the room at Uco,
chocolate is crap.

1147
01:02:30.390 --> 01:02:33.780
The we're getting told to do this thing over here,
this is total crap.

1148
01:02:33.781 --> 01:02:38.400
We shouldn't be told to do this.
And if I go Lafe just calm down,

1149
01:02:38.610 --> 01:02:42.060
it's not that big of a deal.
Like right there,
I've already taken it right.

1150
01:02:42.061 --> 01:02:43.900
Cause you're like,
well what are you talking about?
Not People.

1151
01:02:43.920 --> 01:02:47.730
I tried that with my wife Jenna.
At times it doesn't work very well.
The opposite,

1152
01:02:48.090 --> 01:02:51.870
what you have is you have to be,
you have to show some,
uh,
uh,

1153
01:02:51.930 --> 01:02:55.980
we'll call it a diminished reflection of the motion that they're showing.

1154
01:02:56.130 --> 01:02:58.080
You want to,
you want to take a little off of it,

1155
01:02:58.230 --> 01:03:01.860
but you don't owe my late for you serious.
They're telling us to do that.
Aw Man,

1156
01:03:02.280 --> 01:03:04.830
that's,
that's,
that's crap.
All right,
let's,
let's find out what's going on.

1157
01:03:04.980 --> 01:03:07.320
So now instead of being against you,
now all of a sudden I'm on your side.

1158
01:03:07.920 --> 01:03:09.930
I've calmed down a little bit.
I've brought you down a little bit,

1159
01:03:09.990 --> 01:03:12.630
but you at least recognize that I'm on your side.
Because if I just,

1160
01:03:12.750 --> 01:03:16.820
if I just say relief,
calm down,
getting mad is not going to help.
Won't like,

1161
01:03:16.950 --> 01:03:19.950
you're going to get even matter where if I say you need to think about what

1162
01:03:19.951 --> 01:03:24.480
they're saying,
no,
no,
I need to join your side first.
Once I'm on your side,

1163
01:03:24.630 --> 01:03:27.420
now we can talk and we can move through the problem effectively.

1164
01:03:27.630 --> 01:03:31.880
So you might want to just show a little diminished reflection of the purr of,

1165
01:03:31.881 --> 01:03:34.500
you know,
if someone's really sad about something,
okay.
You know,

1166
01:03:34.501 --> 01:03:36.810
you can't just be like,
hey,
it's not that big of a deal.
Like,
Hey,
you know,
I got,

1167
01:03:37.020 --> 01:03:40.670
I got kids,
right?
I got,
I got teenage girls and you know,

1168
01:03:40.710 --> 01:03:45.450
they get sad about stuff.
Um,
and I can't just,
you know,
I've tried it before,
like,

1169
01:03:45.451 --> 01:03:48.690
don't worry about that.
It will mean nothing in three years I've done that.

1170
01:03:48.790 --> 01:03:50.550
I'm like,
by the time you graduated high school,

1171
01:03:50.551 --> 01:03:54.180
you don't even think about that anymore.
Stop.
How does that work?

1172
01:03:54.600 --> 01:03:57.690
It doesn't work good because you realize that that's the whole world to them.
So,

1173
01:03:57.720 --> 01:04:00.390
you know,
instead you've got to say,
aw man,
I can't believe that happened.

1174
01:04:00.391 --> 01:04:02.640
You know?
That's,
that's,
that's sad,
you know?

1175
01:04:02.641 --> 01:04:05.400
But the good thing is here's some good points about it and maybe,

1176
01:04:05.401 --> 01:04:06.120
you know what I mean?

1177
01:04:06.120 --> 01:04:11.120
So just don't be completely emotionless because then the person can't relate to

1178
01:04:12.020 --> 01:04:14.610
you.
And if they can't relate to you,
you're not gonna be able to talk about it.

1179
01:04:14.610 --> 01:04:17.550
If you can't talk about it,
you're not going to make any progress on the subject.

1180
01:04:19.250 --> 01:04:21.210
Careful of that one.
All right.

1181
01:04:22.240 --> 01:04:24.720
Want to hear more HDH in Vegas.

1182
01:04:25.050 --> 01:04:28.590
Did we talk about the HDH hands on one of the other podcasts?
Yeah,

1183
01:04:28.620 --> 01:04:31.950
we talked about it.
It's $100 on cast.
Vegas isn't a podcast 11,

1184
01:04:31.951 --> 01:04:36.000
if you want to hear about a markedly.
So [inaudible] is to Vegas.
We did have,
uh,

1185
01:04:36.720 --> 01:04:39.300
there were,
there were a couple of good stories.
Vegas and we,
you know,
we,

1186
01:04:39.301 --> 01:04:42.660
that was a crazy boondoggle chat but one of them that I,
I did,
uh,

1187
01:04:43.050 --> 01:04:47.130
remember well was we had this giant convoy of Humvees and uh,

1188
01:04:47.190 --> 01:04:51.340
we were coming up to a major intersection just off the Vegas trip.
Uh,

1189
01:04:51.420 --> 01:04:54.750
a red light cause we were just so everyone knows we're driving.
We drove the,

1190
01:04:55.260 --> 01:04:59.400
the Humvees to arrange to do work up in that area.
Uh,

1191
01:04:59.640 --> 01:05:02.160
there's an air force range knows Nellis Air Force Base.

1192
01:05:02.190 --> 01:05:05.040
So it was a Nellis range where they do training up there.

1193
01:05:05.041 --> 01:05:10.041
And we had taken the Humvees from one base on civilian roads to another base and

1194
01:05:10.531 --> 01:05:13.650
we'd spent the day training there and now it was time to come back to base.

1195
01:05:13.651 --> 01:05:18.070
And we're back on civilian roads again in a,
in a convoy of Humvees.
What,

1196
01:05:18.070 --> 01:05:20.740
<v 2>five trucks?
Probably.
So five Humvees.</v>

1197
01:05:20.920 --> 01:05:23.860
And we had done a drill where we had the,
we,

1198
01:05:24.280 --> 01:05:26.590
I was always big on you train how you fight,
right?

1199
01:05:26.800 --> 01:05:28.750
So that means if we're driving home fees,
guess what we're doing?

1200
01:05:28.960 --> 01:05:30.420
We're mounting weapons.
We're going to,

1201
01:05:30.460 --> 01:05:32.710
we're going to be ready to get after it if we have to.

1202
01:05:33.100 --> 01:05:35.500
Not that we're gonna have to get after it in Vegas,
but we're going to,

1203
01:05:35.501 --> 01:05:38.500
we're going to test things because if you're not used to swing that gun around,

1204
01:05:38.501 --> 01:05:41.950
up in the up in the Turret,
then you're not used to it.
So you've got a practice.

1205
01:05:41.951 --> 01:05:46.060
So we were basically in,
in full kind of kit.

1206
01:05:46.270 --> 01:05:48.100
I think we actually had the whole task in us.

1207
01:05:48.101 --> 01:05:51.460
I think we had like eight or 10 humvees.
It was,
it was,
it was a big,
big tomboy.

1208
01:05:51.970 --> 01:05:54.370
But,
uh,
yeah,
so we come up to it.
We're coming up to a red light.

1209
01:05:54.371 --> 01:05:58.900
The red light starts to turn yellow and the lead,
the lead navigator.
Um,
yeah,

1210
01:05:58.940 --> 01:06:02.200
this is a major intersection,
you know,
two,
four lane roads that are coming up,

1211
01:06:02.230 --> 01:06:07.060
coming up to,
uh,
he's,
he gives the command below,
through,
which means that a,

1212
01:06:07.090 --> 01:06:07.690
we're just,

1213
01:06:07.690 --> 01:06:11.160
if you get your an ambush and people are shooting at you and you're just going

1214
01:06:11.161 --> 01:06:13.600
to keep rolling and he says blow through.

1215
01:06:14.140 --> 01:06:17.020
So we literally have the entire convoy behind him,

1216
01:06:17.021 --> 01:06:20.280
like running this red light and a major,
major intersection.
I was like,

1217
01:06:20.570 --> 01:06:23.870
we're going to be standing tall off the Abu [inaudible].

1218
01:06:24.040 --> 01:06:26.290
We don't want to do that because in,
in like an Iraqi,

1219
01:06:26.291 --> 01:06:28.930
you wouldn't stop at a red light or you wouldn't stop at a stop sign.
You,

1220
01:06:28.960 --> 01:06:32.140
you know,
you obviously the lead vehicle would check close enough and then you,

1221
01:06:32.380 --> 01:06:35.110
you're traveling really tight and you make sure there's no cars coming.
But yeah,

1222
01:06:35.111 --> 01:06:37.630
you're just going to blow through.
You're not going to stop.
And so that,
yeah,

1223
01:06:37.631 --> 01:06:38.950
the call came out to blow through,

1224
01:06:39.150 --> 01:06:41.770
which we're going to get in trouble for that it would have been a fight.
Well,

1225
01:06:41.771 --> 01:06:45.810
luckily we had some heads up drivers that stopped at the,
at the,
their green and,

1226
01:06:45.811 --> 01:06:46.750
and saw us coming,

1227
01:06:46.751 --> 01:06:49.990
or maybe they were intimidated by guys with 50 cal machine guns and the Turret.

1228
01:06:50.470 --> 01:06:52.060
But,
uh,
definitely,
uh,
you know,

1229
01:06:52.061 --> 01:06:54.610
that's one of those things where it's hard for guys to turn it off sometimes.

1230
01:06:54.611 --> 01:06:55.300
And then when you're,

1231
01:06:55.300 --> 01:06:59.560
when you're doing tactical driving on the range as if you were in a combat

1232
01:06:59.561 --> 01:07:03.790
scenario and all of a sudden you're on the street again,
this is hard.

1233
01:07:04.290 --> 01:07:08.830
I should have been said,
okay guys,
we're going back on swing roads.

1234
01:07:08.980 --> 01:07:11.260
Stand down.
You know what I mean?
I should have said that,

1235
01:07:11.470 --> 01:07:15.040
but I didn't say that because I'm dumb and I,
you know,
we,
we,
we,

1236
01:07:15.070 --> 01:07:17.950
we made the assumption,
which turned out to be false,

1237
01:07:17.951 --> 01:07:20.170
that people would automatically know that and they didn't.

1238
01:07:21.110 --> 01:07:24.600
So we had to tighten that up.
But,
uh,
that was just one lesson learned from our,

1239
01:07:24.601 --> 01:07:27.250
our biggest trick that was shenanigans.
These good times.

1240
01:07:27.280 --> 01:07:31.630
I'm surprised I didn't get in more trouble for that.
One of the one a year guys,

1241
01:07:32.140 --> 01:07:32.973
we were in a,

1242
01:07:33.010 --> 01:07:38.010
he was a designated driver wearing a navy fan and we go from one place,

1243
01:07:39.680 --> 01:07:43.870
we knew someone and we were out in town and we went from there to downtown to go

1244
01:07:43.871 --> 01:07:44.920
to know the bars.

1245
01:07:44.980 --> 01:07:49.030
Right in Vegas we're pulling into a parking garage and you know how they have

1246
01:07:49.031 --> 01:07:51.670
that metal pipe that says,
you know,
six foot,

1247
01:07:51.671 --> 01:07:54.250
two inch clearance or whatever the clearance was.

1248
01:07:54.251 --> 01:07:56.890
It was a very low parking garage.
So he's got this big Navy van.

1249
01:07:56.891 --> 01:08:01.570
We come in and we kind of hit that.
And I'm,

1250
01:08:01.620 --> 01:08:03.190
I'm sitting in the back at,
and you know what,

1251
01:08:03.280 --> 01:08:06.040
this is a classic example of a decentralized command.

1252
01:08:06.070 --> 01:08:09.590
I'm not gonna step on the toes.
The guys,
the designated driver,
I wasn't drinking.

1253
01:08:09.750 --> 01:08:14.230
I had a few drinks or whatever,
but I wasn't definitely wasn't intoxicated.
And,

1254
01:08:14.960 --> 01:08:15.890
but I see,
oh,

1255
01:08:15.980 --> 01:08:18.350
<v 0>like I look out and see what we,
we kind of hit that thing.</v>

1256
01:08:19.220 --> 01:08:23.840
And so we go around the corner and then we start to actually enter the parking

1257
01:08:23.841 --> 01:08:28.610
garage.
And as we go underneath the first concrete beam,
the,

1258
01:08:28.760 --> 01:08:32.450
the,
it's,
you can hear it with scrapes against the ceiling,

1259
01:08:32.790 --> 01:08:35.630
but it scrapes hard and the vehicle comes to a stop.

1260
01:08:36.800 --> 01:08:40.790
And what does the driver do again?
This is the designated driver.
What does he do?

1261
01:08:41.300 --> 01:08:45.110
He starts pressing down the gas.
He's just going to power through this.

1262
01:08:46.330 --> 01:08:50.780
I'm in the back.
I go,
dude,
blow through.
I'm like,
dude,
what are you doing?

1263
01:08:51.200 --> 01:08:55.040
Stop.
What are you going to rip the roof off of the vehicle?

1264
01:08:55.790 --> 01:08:58.940
Like back out here in leave music?
Well,
we photo made mood.

1265
01:09:01.310 --> 01:09:02.100
Oh Man.

1266
01:09:02.100 --> 01:09:04.020
<v 4>One,
one Gig,
a team guy.</v>

1267
01:09:04.021 --> 01:09:08.640
Shenanigans that we were talking about was me,
you and the Delta commander.

1268
01:09:09.360 --> 01:09:12.780
Dell platoon commander.
Rolling.
Rolling up to Santa Barbara.

1269
01:09:12.930 --> 01:09:16.170
I think you actually came up to me and said,
tenacious.

1270
01:09:16.171 --> 01:09:20.100
D.
O.
U.
S.
E.
Tenacious D.
Yeah.
So for those of you may not know,

1271
01:09:20.130 --> 01:09:21.930
Jocko is a huge tenacious d fan,

1272
01:09:22.810 --> 01:09:25.560
the d and I think that that's how it came out.

1273
01:09:25.561 --> 01:09:30.090
You're like the d there in Santa Barbara.
Let's go.
Road trip,
road trip,

1274
01:09:30.091 --> 01:09:34.020
road Gig,
no Gig.
So we jumped in.
Yeah.

1275
01:09:34.021 --> 01:09:35.970
Of all the things that you gave me,

1276
01:09:35.971 --> 01:09:39.970
you gave me a copy of about face by David Hackworth.
When,
when,

1277
01:09:40.110 --> 01:09:43.230
when we were working together to you brazer a at the end of our art,

1278
01:09:43.231 --> 01:09:46.530
our tour together.
And you gave me the,
this set to the,

1279
01:09:46.531 --> 01:09:49.880
of the DVDs to tenacious d and the dove tiggers.

1280
01:09:49.890 --> 01:09:52.170
So that's the dichotomy of leadership right there.

1281
01:09:52.410 --> 01:09:55.500
Hackworth about faced that tenacious d.

1282
01:09:56.190 --> 01:09:59.550
So we found out tenacious d was having a,
having a concert up in Santa Barbara,

1283
01:09:59.551 --> 01:10:01.200
you know,
were all stationed here at San Diego and,

1284
01:10:01.360 --> 01:10:06.360
and we jumped in Jockos dodge grand,

1285
01:10:06.481 --> 01:10:08.190
1997 Dodge Grand Caravan,

1286
01:10:08.191 --> 01:10:13.191
1997 a lot of people just called it the pimp wagon because it was hard to keep

1287
01:10:14.161 --> 01:10:16.440
the ladies off when you're rolling.

1288
01:10:16.450 --> 01:10:20.700
And this is the window was tape shot on the driver's side.
It's too rigorous.

1289
01:10:20.701 --> 01:10:22.560
Taped,
shut harder.
You weren't getting in there.

1290
01:10:22.910 --> 01:10:26.970
Nothing thing was shut because a little electrical thing broke.
So we're uh,

1291
01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:30.060
we're,
we're cheap bastard so we're not going to spend the night up there.

1292
01:10:30.061 --> 01:10:32.550
I think we actually had work to do maybe the next day.
So we jumped,

1293
01:10:32.551 --> 01:10:35.700
we jumped in the van.
Jock,
I think you drove up there.

1294
01:10:35.701 --> 01:10:40.110
We rock out to tenacious d concert in Santa Barbara.
We uh,

1295
01:10:40.111 --> 01:10:43.890
we bought Jocko a tee shirt to still got it.
The Sasquatch is real.

1296
01:10:44.580 --> 01:10:49.260
The Sasquatch is real.
And I remember driving back at about,

1297
01:10:49.410 --> 01:10:51.200
there's about three o'clock in the morning.

1298
01:10:51.220 --> 01:10:54.780
We were like passing through Camp Pendleton as kind of where our ranges are

1299
01:10:54.781 --> 01:10:56.190
there.
As,
as on the way back down,

1300
01:10:56.490 --> 01:11:00.880
we'll just acapella singing to every tenacious d zone that we,

1301
01:11:00.940 --> 01:11:02.970
we knew by heart.
We're going to make a new band.

1302
01:11:02.971 --> 01:11:05.040
It's going to be called Acappella.
Capello d

1303
01:11:07.560 --> 01:11:10.590
that was a good time.
Yeah,
that was a

1304
01:11:10.650 --> 01:11:13.920
<v 0>pretty fun.
All right.
Tenacious d</v>

1305
01:11:15.570 --> 01:11:18.780
<v 3>what are your daily non negotiable habits?</v>

1306
01:11:18.810 --> 01:11:23.810
Wave Babin my daily non negotiable habits use the odd one who,

1307
01:11:25.391 --> 01:11:30.120
uh,
asleep and about 10 30,
10:30 AM and style,
just a,

1308
01:11:30.870 --> 01:11:35.510
he's some donuts.
Listen,
I mean,
I,
I th th at the end of the day,

1309
01:11:35.550 --> 01:11:38.760
just when he goes freedom,
it's a mantra that I learned from you and that it's,

1310
01:11:38.761 --> 01:11:41.410
it just absolutely true.
And if you gotta,
um,

1311
01:11:41.730 --> 01:11:43.980
you gotta get up in the morning to workout on the,
on the,

1312
01:11:44.010 --> 01:11:46.680
there's some days I frankly,
I can't do that because life gets in the way,

1313
01:11:46.681 --> 01:11:50.010
whether I'm,
if I'm traveling or,
uh,
my,

1314
01:11:50.040 --> 01:11:53.640
my kid wakes up early and I know I've been out of town and my wife wants to get

1315
01:11:53.641 --> 01:11:55.170
a workout in before the day starts.

1316
01:11:55.171 --> 01:11:58.710
So I've taken the kids so she can do that and we can,
we can rotate out,
you know,

1317
01:11:58.711 --> 01:12:02.370
so,
so I can't tell you that always happens.
Um,
but you gotta get up early,

1318
01:12:02.430 --> 01:12:04.260
you got to work out and you have to,

1319
01:12:04.320 --> 01:12:07.620
you have to prioritize and eschewed and and having that checklist that you put

1320
01:12:07.621 --> 01:12:11.400
together the night before about what you want to do a and what's important is,

1321
01:12:11.401 --> 01:12:14.340
is absolute critical.
Otherwise you lose it.
And you know,

1322
01:12:14.341 --> 01:12:18.060
for me and Jocko and for all of us at our team on echelon front like it,

1323
01:12:18.090 --> 01:12:21.990
it's when we get away from the things that we talk about the people,

1324
01:12:22.230 --> 01:12:24.450
we're human beings like everybody else and we can get pulled in different

1325
01:12:24.451 --> 01:12:27.120
directions.
When we get away from those things,
it doesn't work.

1326
01:12:27.140 --> 01:12:30.500
They start to fall apart.
You lose,
you lose track of where the priorities are.

1327
01:12:30.540 --> 01:12:32.130
If I can't regularly detach,

1328
01:12:32.220 --> 01:12:34.720
that's something that I have to really focus on to do is is,

1329
01:12:34.740 --> 01:12:35.910
is to regularly detached.

1330
01:12:35.911 --> 01:12:39.000
If I'm grinding on something for two or three or four hours at a time,

1331
01:12:39.330 --> 01:12:41.820
sometimes it's easy to miss other things that are,
that are coming up.

1332
01:12:41.960 --> 01:12:43.680
I got to make sure I pull away from things,

1333
01:12:43.790 --> 01:12:47.100
kind of it kind of think about the prior prioritize.
Nice,
cute piece,
figured out,

1334
01:12:47.101 --> 01:12:49.250
you know,
if I need to reprioritize and,

1335
01:12:49.251 --> 01:12:53.430
and so I don't get target fixating on one thing and,
and,
and keep going.
But,
uh,

1336
01:12:53.431 --> 01:12:54.360
I think for me,

1337
01:12:54.890 --> 01:12:57.750
what I want to do is I try to make time to spend time with my family as much as

1338
01:12:57.751 --> 01:13:00.720
I can as well.
And obviously there's a,
there's a,
there's a lot of work to do.

1339
01:13:00.721 --> 01:13:05.600
There always is.
Um,
and uh,
and it's,
you know,
those things.
Um,

1340
01:13:05.720 --> 01:13:07.350
the,
the,
when,
when,

1341
01:13:07.470 --> 01:13:10.350
when I could stay consistent on getting up early in the morning,

1342
01:13:10.500 --> 01:13:12.000
getting a workout in,
you know,

1343
01:13:12.001 --> 01:13:14.580
stay focused on our list that I have from the night before that I'm falling

1344
01:13:14.581 --> 01:13:18.200
through all of the things that you talk about.
Uh,
that's,
I,
I'm,

1345
01:13:18.260 --> 01:13:23.220
I'm performing better than I ever do to you.
When it works,
at the end of the day,

1346
01:13:23.221 --> 01:13:27.330
there's what works and what doesn't work.
That's how you win.
Check.

1347
01:13:28.320 --> 01:13:32.430
Tell us about a time you were annoyed with Jocko or his intensity.

1348
01:13:36.410 --> 01:13:41.060
Annoyed with Jocko or his intensity.
Um,
you know what,

1349
01:13:41.240 --> 01:13:45.240
we,
uh,
we got along pretty damn well together and uh,
and I think,
uh,

1350
01:13:46.100 --> 01:13:47.180
there's not a,

1351
01:13:47.930 --> 01:13:51.200
there's not really any time that comes to mind that I was annoyed by you except

1352
01:13:51.201 --> 01:13:52.940
for maybe,
you know what,
what I mentioned earlier,
right?

1353
01:13:52.941 --> 01:13:55.580
When the times when initially when we're working together and you're looking

1354
01:13:55.581 --> 01:13:59.690
over my shoulder and telling me to do like,
we should do this way,
let's,
let's,

1355
01:13:59.691 --> 01:14:00.710
let's plan it like that.

1356
01:14:01.010 --> 01:14:04.580
That I definitely got got annoyed from that time when I felt like I want to run

1357
01:14:04.581 --> 01:14:07.070
my,
you know,
everyone's trying to tell me what to do here.

1358
01:14:07.071 --> 01:14:09.170
And jock was looking over my shoulder.
I want to run,

1359
01:14:09.290 --> 01:14:11.590
run my team just as I earlier.

1360
01:14:12.030 --> 01:14:15.490
<v 2>Um,
and,
and I didn't realize until later like what you are doing,
you're like,
hey,</v>

1361
01:14:15.491 --> 01:14:18.640
you're,
you're passing,
you're passing on a lot of great information.

1362
01:14:18.770 --> 01:14:22.800
And I see that all the time actually with people because if I could have

1363
01:14:22.810 --> 01:14:26.410
detached from that situation,
I would recognize like,
Hey,
I'm a new Pataki manner.

1364
01:14:26.470 --> 01:14:29.050
I've never been at a tick manner.
Jocko was just doubled their commander.

1365
01:14:29.230 --> 01:14:32.240
He had a highly successful particular manner tour.
He had historic deployment.

1366
01:14:32.270 --> 01:14:35.710
We did a whole bunch operations.
Uh,
and he's got a ton of lessons learned.

1367
01:14:35.770 --> 01:14:38.800
So what an amazing opportunity to learn everything from him.

1368
01:14:39.310 --> 01:14:42.790
But that's not the way you approach it,
right?
It's like an ego.
My Ego,

1369
01:14:43.240 --> 01:14:46.060
and I see it all the time.
There was a,
there was a leader,

1370
01:14:46.690 --> 01:14:50.420
a leader I was dealing with were,
I was talking to a member of the board,
um,

1371
01:14:50.470 --> 01:14:53.680
for this particular leader who was constantly bucking against the,
you know,

1372
01:14:53.681 --> 01:14:57.130
this guys.
And it was,
it's amazing to me though to see like,
hey,
the,

1373
01:14:57.131 --> 01:15:00.190
the CEO of this company who's pushing back in September the board,
like,

1374
01:15:00.790 --> 01:15:04.780
he should be so thankful that the member of the board has,

1375
01:15:04.840 --> 01:15:06.670
who's got massive amounts of experience.

1376
01:15:06.671 --> 01:15:10.150
Extraordinary success is there to mentor and train them.

1377
01:15:10.151 --> 01:15:13.480
And yet he doesn't want to listen to that guy.
I want to do it myself.

1378
01:15:13.510 --> 01:15:16.090
You're always over my shoulder.
Instead of being like,
hey man,

1379
01:15:16.240 --> 01:15:19.370
open up the legal pad.
Let's take some notes here.
I'm going to,

1380
01:15:19.371 --> 01:15:22.680
I want to pick your brain for everything.
I want to,
you know,
it's,
it's,
and,

1381
01:15:22.730 --> 01:15:25.860
and I think just recognize if you're feeling that way and you're frustrated
with,

1382
01:15:26.110 --> 01:15:28.510
with somebody who's,
uh,
looking over your shoulder,

1383
01:15:28.540 --> 01:15:32.440
then then you need to take advantage of the situation and learn from them.
Uh,

1384
01:15:32.441 --> 01:15:34.480
and certainly build up,
trust the bow.

1385
01:15:34.480 --> 01:15:36.910
The way to get out of that situation is to build up trust that show that you,

1386
01:15:37.120 --> 01:15:38.460
you're learning,
you're growing and,

1387
01:15:38.461 --> 01:15:40.900
and that you don't need someone to look over your shoulder every second.

1388
01:15:40.930 --> 01:15:45.930
And usually that comes even after we got forward and you just unleashed us on

1389
01:15:46.301 --> 01:15:49.130
the battlefield,
I would always come to you and be like,
Hey Jackie,

1390
01:15:49.131 --> 01:15:51.100
what do you think about this?
We're going to do this situation.

1391
01:15:51.280 --> 01:15:53.980
I wasn't looking to you to tell me what to do,
uh,

1392
01:15:53.981 --> 01:15:56.560
but I was running things by you.
And we do that all the time.

1393
01:15:56.561 --> 01:16:00.160
Now that's not in front.
I called Jocko up and say,
hey,
here's what's going on.

1394
01:16:00.161 --> 01:16:02.410
I'm working with this leader.
Uh,
you do the same.
I mean we,

1395
01:16:02.420 --> 01:16:05.830
we talk about these things all the time and that it's actually that,

1396
01:16:06.300 --> 01:16:09.520
what's interesting about that is that in the last six months,

1397
01:16:09.521 --> 01:16:12.400
that idea has really become formalized in the tank,

1398
01:16:12.490 --> 01:16:17.350
which is where we take the companies that we're working with and we,

1399
01:16:17.351 --> 01:16:19.180
whoever's working specifically with,

1400
01:16:19.320 --> 01:16:23.540
with a specific company on the ground is coming back to the tank,
all,

1401
01:16:23.541 --> 01:16:24.760
all the echelon front team.

1402
01:16:24.790 --> 01:16:29.790
And we get on the call or the Skype or the conference room and we'd go through

1403
01:16:31.330 --> 01:16:33.940
all the issues that all these different companies are happening and that's where

1404
01:16:33.941 --> 01:16:36.940
we solve the problems is in the tank.
So that way we get everyone's input.

1405
01:16:37.090 --> 01:16:40.060
And not only do we give the best solution to the client,

1406
01:16:40.420 --> 01:16:43.650
we also all learned from it so that we have that solution in our heads.

1407
01:16:43.651 --> 01:16:45.880
So it'd be we all get stronger and better.
So that's,

1408
01:16:45.990 --> 01:16:48.790
that's one of the evolutions and national on front that's pretty awesome to see

1409
01:16:48.791 --> 01:16:53.440
is what started off as just like how we would run to you.
Bruiser,
which is,
hey,

1410
01:16:53.441 --> 01:16:55.510
we're going to bounce ideas off each other and hey,

1411
01:16:55.570 --> 01:16:57.850
I don't know how to solve this problem to you or hey,

1412
01:16:57.910 --> 01:17:00.220
I don't know how to do this operation to you or this is what I think,

1413
01:17:00.221 --> 01:17:00.881
what do you think?

1414
01:17:00.881 --> 01:17:05.320
Which is the way a team should work together and now what we do is we get to do

1415
01:17:05.321 --> 01:17:07.870
that for other companies.
Use the same brainpower,

1416
01:17:07.890 --> 01:17:10.340
you use the same methodology and it's,

1417
01:17:10.400 --> 01:17:14.990
<v 0>it's awesome to do and it's awesome to see.
It is awesome.
The tank.
Yeah,</v>

1418
01:17:14.991 --> 01:17:19.580
getting in the tank.
Uh,
all right,
life.
You were,
for those of you who don't know,

1419
01:17:19.581 --> 01:17:22.190
life was a ship driver for how many years before.

1420
01:17:22.250 --> 01:17:25.510
So me didn't get picked up for seal teams right out road.

1421
01:17:25.520 --> 01:17:27.500
Didn't get picked up for buds right out of the Naval Academy.

1422
01:17:27.501 --> 01:17:31.340
So he had to go to a ship.
Here's a question about,
not about that specifically,

1423
01:17:31.341 --> 01:17:35.000
but a life.
What are your thoughts on a ship's captain?

1424
01:17:35.001 --> 01:17:39.440
Being relieved of command and what to do if you are involved.

1425
01:17:40.310 --> 01:17:45.310
And he would like to know from the ship's captains perspective that is being

1426
01:17:45.681 --> 01:17:49.480
relieved because of the mistakes of your crew or if you're in the crew and the

1427
01:17:49.481 --> 01:17:52.100
captain's getting real,
getting relieved even though you made the mistakes.

1428
01:17:52.101 --> 01:17:53.450
What are you,
what are your perspectives on that?

1429
01:17:55.150 --> 01:17:58.660
<v 3>Well,
look,
just to give people some background on that.</v>

1430
01:17:58.661 --> 01:18:02.170
I know I've talked about my background in podcast 11,
but,
but it was,

1431
01:18:02.200 --> 01:18:03.910
I never wanted to be a shift job.
I wanted to be a seal.

1432
01:18:03.911 --> 01:18:06.790
That's why I went to the Naval Academy.
Uh,
I got thrust in that position.

1433
01:18:06.970 --> 01:18:08.080
Looking back on it.
It was,

1434
01:18:08.110 --> 01:18:12.250
it was an amazing opportunity for me as a young man to have to be in those

1435
01:18:12.251 --> 01:18:13.001
leadership positions.

1436
01:18:13.001 --> 01:18:17.630
And I enjoyed my time on the ship is a warship cost to build billion,

1437
01:18:17.940 --> 01:18:20.290
couple of billion dollars.
Crazy.
So you're,
you're,
you're,

1438
01:18:20.560 --> 01:18:22.390
sometimes you're the guy,
right?

1439
01:18:22.391 --> 01:18:26.620
You're a lieutenant JG on the bridge of a $2 billion ship and you're in charge

1440
01:18:26.621 --> 01:18:27.290
of all,
when you're,

1441
01:18:27.290 --> 01:18:29.710
when you're the officer of the deck that you're the guy in charge,

1442
01:18:29.711 --> 01:18:33.380
the captain's asleep in his cabin and he's got all full,

1443
01:18:33.400 --> 01:18:35.530
full faith and trust in you and you're running the ship.

1444
01:18:35.690 --> 01:18:37.970
<v 0>And so there's the question right there.
Sometimes the captain,</v>

1445
01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:42.200
the ship asleep in the cabin and he runs the [inaudible] and the crew runs the

1446
01:18:42.201 --> 01:18:44.750
ship aground,
the captain gets fired.
What do you think about that?

1447
01:18:45.380 --> 01:18:50.180
<v 3>That is the navy way.
It's uh,
it's always been that way.
Uh,
and uh,</v>

1448
01:18:50.210 --> 01:18:53.930
I think it's 100% correct because there are no bad teams,
only bad leaders.

1449
01:18:53.990 --> 01:18:56.490
And I think that if you have,
um,

1450
01:18:56.630 --> 01:18:59.360
even if the captain wasn't in direct responsibility,

1451
01:18:59.660 --> 01:19:03.530
it's his job to train that team.
It's his job to mentor that team.

1452
01:19:03.531 --> 01:19:06.960
And if he's got questions about whether or not somebody is,
uh,

1453
01:19:06.980 --> 01:19:10.340
has the capability to do that job,
uh,
then,

1454
01:19:10.370 --> 01:19:12.650
then they shouldn't be in that position.
It's up,
it's up,
it's up,

1455
01:19:12.740 --> 01:19:15.800
it's up to the captain now.
The captain can be everywhere at once.

1456
01:19:15.801 --> 01:19:20.600
So it's decentralized command.
He has to rely on his leaders.
But,
uh,
it's,
um,

1457
01:19:21.530 --> 01:19:24.810
it's definitely,
uh,
I think ultimately the,
the,

1458
01:19:24.811 --> 01:19:27.790
the captain is responsible and that's really what makes ownership stuff.

1459
01:19:28.010 --> 01:19:30.770
<v 0>A client asks me a question yesterday,
uh,</v>

1460
01:19:31.010 --> 01:19:35.030
have you ever sent anyone to do something that they weren't ready to do?

1461
01:19:36.710 --> 01:19:40.700
And I thought about it for a minute,
and the first thought was,

1462
01:19:41.780 --> 01:19:46.670
well,
of course then the second thought was,
no,
the real answer is it's gray area.

1463
01:19:46.700 --> 01:19:50.630
Right?
Did I ever send somebody to do something that they weren't 100%.

1464
01:19:50.930 --> 01:19:55.580
If I put this quantification on 100% ready for it,
all the time,
all the time,

1465
01:19:56.800 --> 01:20:01.220
uh,
how often did I send somebody to do something that they weren't capable of

1466
01:20:01.221 --> 01:20:06.110
doing?
The answer is zero.
In other words,
if you weren't capable of doing this,

1467
01:20:06.111 --> 01:20:08.010
and I didn't trust that you could make

1468
01:20:08.010 --> 01:20:09.750
<v 2>it happen,
I wasn't gonna let you do it.</v>

1469
01:20:09.751 --> 01:20:12.540
That'd be irresponsible for me as a leader to let a subordinate go and do

1470
01:20:12.541 --> 01:20:14.340
something that they're not ready to do.
That's it.
Period.

1471
01:20:14.940 --> 01:20:16.920
Or they're not 100% ready to do,
are there?
No,
not,

1472
01:20:16.921 --> 01:20:18.540
not 100% but they're not capable of doing.

1473
01:20:18.900 --> 01:20:22.200
But I mean when we first got to Ramadi in your mind,

1474
01:20:22.680 --> 01:20:25.560
you probably weren't a hundred percent ready to go out there and execute.

1475
01:20:26.090 --> 01:20:29.790
And particularly because we've had training for a mission with just seals,

1476
01:20:30.150 --> 01:20:34.050
you know,
for,
for,
for roll-up assaults or direct action raids,
you know,

1477
01:20:34.051 --> 01:20:37.240
at nighttime and all of a sudden we're shifting to daytime counterinsurgency

1478
01:20:37.350 --> 01:20:41.060
operations,
working with Iraqi soldiers.
Completely different mission.
Yeah.

1479
01:20:41.070 --> 01:20:43.110
Broken up in all these different units.
We hadn't trained,

1480
01:20:43.140 --> 01:20:47.970
we haven't trained like that in a violent war zone by the way.
But I,
you know,

1481
01:20:47.971 --> 01:20:52.971
I had trust that you were completely competent and capable of doing that.

1482
01:20:53.250 --> 01:20:56.370
And if I didn't think that and I didn't think you were competent or I didn't

1483
01:20:56.371 --> 01:21:01.140
think you were capable,
then I would be a bad leader if I said,
yeah,

1484
01:21:01.141 --> 01:21:03.070
go ahead and go to go do that.
And,

1485
01:21:03.071 --> 01:21:04.680
and then I answered the question further to this client.

1486
01:21:04.681 --> 01:21:08.490
I said there was two people from tasking at bruiser that didn't go on deployment

1487
01:21:08.491 --> 01:21:13.050
with us because they weren't capable of doing that job.
So yes,
you as a leader,

1488
01:21:13.051 --> 01:21:14.190
you're responsible.
I was thinking about this.

1489
01:21:14.250 --> 01:21:18.240
There's been times where navy ships have run aground and the captain wasn't even

1490
01:21:18.241 --> 01:21:21.810
on board.
He had flown to somewhere to go do a meeting somewhere.

1491
01:21:21.840 --> 01:21:23.020
The ship runs aground.
Guess what?

1492
01:21:23.050 --> 01:21:27.030
Still getting fired because you left someone in charge that you left that team.

1493
01:21:27.031 --> 01:21:30.090
You didn't train them well enough,
and you can make all the excuses you want.

1494
01:21:30.090 --> 01:21:31.860
I wasn't there.
Yeah.
Well guess what?

1495
01:21:31.950 --> 01:21:34.080
You're still getting fired because you were responsible for that team.

1496
01:21:34.350 --> 01:21:37.590
So I think part of that too is the understanding.
You know what?
No bad teams,

1497
01:21:37.591 --> 01:21:38.490
only bad leaders.

1498
01:21:38.910 --> 01:21:43.800
The chapter two we wrote extreme ownership is about the part of that is,

1499
01:21:44.070 --> 01:21:46.920
I have seen some people misinterpret that,
right?
To say,
well,

1500
01:21:46.921 --> 01:21:50.180
I'll get a better leader.
So the team's not good.
That's not an excuse.

1501
01:21:50.610 --> 01:21:52.110
So when we're talking about leadership,

1502
01:21:52.111 --> 01:21:55.470
we're talking about leaders at every level of the organization.
So,
so,
you know,

1503
01:21:55.471 --> 01:21:56.520
if you're,
if you're,

1504
01:21:56.610 --> 01:22:00.480
if you're a department head on that ship or a division officer,
a division chief,

1505
01:22:00.840 --> 01:22:03.990
and you say,
Oh,
I've got a bad,
I got a bad commanding officer,

1506
01:22:04.100 --> 01:22:06.000
it's all the commanding officers fall.
Our ship doesn't,

1507
01:22:06.160 --> 01:22:08.610
does it perform the way it should?
Whatever your team is,

1508
01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:10.020
that's not an excuse you.

1509
01:22:10.020 --> 01:22:14.500
You got to do your utmost to get your team ready to train others around you,
uh,

1510
01:22:14.520 --> 01:22:17.250
and,
and lead that team as much as you possibly can.

1511
01:22:17.251 --> 01:22:19.320
And you don't have to be the senior guy in charge and office.

1512
01:22:19.321 --> 01:22:22.920
Some of the best units we work with,
and we're part of the senior guy,
may not,

1513
01:22:22.950 --> 01:22:24.840
he may have been the guy driving the operations,

1514
01:22:25.020 --> 01:22:28.710
but he allowed his leaders to go out and execute and,
and make it happen.

1515
01:22:28.711 --> 01:22:31.640
So leadership,
we're talking,
we're talking to leaders at every level,

1516
01:22:31.660 --> 01:22:34.770
the organization.
It's not an excuse to put the blame on the boss.
Uh,

1517
01:22:35.010 --> 01:22:39.360
you gotta step up.
You got to lead and own your team,
solve problems,

1518
01:22:39.390 --> 01:22:41.910
get better,
learn from mistakes and make it happen.

1519
01:22:42.510 --> 01:22:46.380
What does it mean when a ship runs aground mean,
literally hits dirt?
Oh,

1520
01:22:47.050 --> 01:22:51.300
it's true.
Well,
and in this case,
we're talking about ship collisions.

1521
01:22:51.960 --> 01:22:56.740
So running to ground is one thing.
Uh,
the,
um,
you know,
and there's an org,

1522
01:22:56.830 --> 01:23:00.360
there is an argument to be said like,
because some of our greatest leaders like,

1523
01:23:00.530 --> 01:23:03.560
uh,
Adam wrote fleet,
Admiral Chester Nimitz who was the hero,

1524
01:23:03.590 --> 01:23:05.830
the Pacific war was the,
quoted him,

1525
01:23:06.060 --> 01:23:08.050
<v 4>you know,
on this,
uh,
on this Badass.
Previously,</v>

1526
01:23:08.610 --> 01:23:11.740
he was the commander in chief of all US forces in the Pacific.
So he was,

1527
01:23:11.860 --> 01:23:13.290
he was the,
the,
the,

1528
01:23:13.300 --> 01:23:17.980
the person responsible for the entire war effort against the Japanese in World

1529
01:23:17.980 --> 01:23:20.590
War II.
And that victory,
uh,
a massive effort,

1530
01:23:20.591 --> 01:23:23.560
obviously in an extraordinary turnaround,
uh,
from,

1531
01:23:23.590 --> 01:23:28.570
from disaster to two victory.
He actually ran the ship aground as,
as a,

1532
01:23:28.571 --> 01:23:30.580
as a junior officer.
So,
so there's,
you know,

1533
01:23:30.581 --> 01:23:32.650
there's an argument to be made that there is no fee.
You know,

1534
01:23:32.680 --> 01:23:35.680
the flawless performance.
It doesn't exist and people make mistakes.

1535
01:23:35.681 --> 01:23:40.360
You can learn from it.
Um,
you know,
as far as ships running around,
um,
you know,

1536
01:23:40.361 --> 01:23:41.830
that,
that's one thing I think,
you know,

1537
01:23:41.831 --> 01:23:43.480
you can make a care of a careful evaluation.

1538
01:23:43.600 --> 01:23:47.440
What we're talking about here that is specifically say ship collisions and uh,

1539
01:23:47.441 --> 01:23:51.010
you know,
those,
those should not happen that just,
that should not happen.

1540
01:23:51.010 --> 01:23:53.830
I understand how easily that can happen cause it,
there's a,

1541
01:23:54.010 --> 01:23:58.570
these are huge machines that go very fast and you're out on the ocean with

1542
01:23:58.810 --> 01:23:59.470
other,

1543
01:23:59.470 --> 01:24:02.710
other ships that are moving around and there's a whole lot of dangerous things.

1544
01:24:03.160 --> 01:24:07.210
Those big ships takes miles to stop them.
Like even if you see it,
you go,
okay,

1545
01:24:07.211 --> 01:24:09.940
hit all full breaks right now.
It doesn't matter.
You're still going to hit.

1546
01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:13.240
Absolutely.
You know,
you're going to get hit for like 10 minutes.
Yup.
You know,

1547
01:24:13.241 --> 01:24:16.720
if you can't stop it,
just brace for impact.
Yeah.
But,
but if you've got,

1548
01:24:16.750 --> 01:24:18.890
you've got the right team in place,
they know what they're doing,
you know,
there,

1549
01:24:18.920 --> 01:24:21.070
there's all kinds of safe,
safe guards in place.

1550
01:24:21.071 --> 01:24:23.950
And if that team's properly trained,
like that should not happen.
It shouldn't.
I,

1551
01:24:23.951 --> 01:24:26.770
it's like you should be able to,
the airplane should land safely.

1552
01:24:26.800 --> 01:24:29.680
All the horrible things that could go wrong when you're flying in an airplane

1553
01:24:29.681 --> 01:24:34.390
and landing in a crazy airport like JFK or lax Hong Kong.

1554
01:24:34.540 --> 01:24:37.930
Yeah,
that's a doozy.
So those,
those kinds of things that are crazy.
So,

1555
01:24:38.020 --> 01:24:39.490
but there's a lot of things to go wrong,

1556
01:24:39.491 --> 01:24:42.550
but if it's done properly and safeguards are in place,
you're going to,

1557
01:24:42.610 --> 01:24:45.540
you're going to be fine.
So,
so,
so,
but there's again,
it,

1558
01:24:45.541 --> 01:24:47.950
it doesn't mean that we expect flawless performance,

1559
01:24:47.951 --> 01:24:51.610
that no one's ever going to make mistakes.
I think if a mistake isn't that bad,

1560
01:24:51.611 --> 01:24:55.240
it should be forgiven.
But there isn't.
There just isn't an excuse of like,
well,

1561
01:24:55.241 --> 01:24:57.790
it wasn't me.
Somebody else on my team did it.

1562
01:24:57.970 --> 01:25:00.220
That's the opposite extreme in ownership.
It doesn't work.

1563
01:25:00.720 --> 01:25:05.110
That was the word check.
Next.

1564
01:25:06.720 --> 01:25:08.950
This is really,
well I guess,
yeah,
I guess it is for life.

1565
01:25:09.670 --> 01:25:14.230
I heard you say it is important to think I heard Jocko say this too.

1566
01:25:14.710 --> 01:25:18.310
How do you think meaning,
how do you talk to yourself?

1567
01:25:18.400 --> 01:25:22.060
Do you ask yourself questions?
Do you think by talking to others,

1568
01:25:22.210 --> 01:25:26.800
what do you believe is the most valuable method for becoming a clear thinker and

1569
01:25:26.801 --> 01:25:31.040
communicator?
That's a deep question.

1570
01:25:31.550 --> 01:25:33.980
I actually think it's pretty easy to answer.
It is easy answer.

1571
01:25:33.981 --> 01:25:38.030
I think I can answer in one word.
Go Detach.

1572
01:25:40.470 --> 01:25:44.400
That's that's,
that's how I think.
You can't,
you got to step out.

1573
01:25:44.430 --> 01:25:46.680
You got to step back mentally.
You've got to step back,

1574
01:25:46.800 --> 01:25:50.940
look at what's going on and think of and that's where you can think about it.

1575
01:25:50.941 --> 01:25:54.660
That's where you can figure out what's going on.
If you can do that,
you're there.

1576
01:25:55.170 --> 01:25:58.470
If you can't do it,
you don't even know you're not doing it.
That's the problem.

1577
01:25:58.770 --> 01:26:00.990
When you're not detached,
you don't even know you're not detached,

1578
01:26:00.991 --> 01:26:04.070
you're in the storm and you don't even it.
That's a

1579
01:26:04.070 --> 01:26:05.750
<v 3>job for,
that's exactly right,</v>

1580
01:26:05.990 --> 01:26:09.320
but I think you know for people that maybe don't fully understand what that

1581
01:26:09.321 --> 01:26:10.100
means.
Right.

1582
01:26:10.100 --> 01:26:12.950
This this idea of the tasks of which you've obviously talked a lot about on

1583
01:26:12.951 --> 01:26:17.950
hearing,
which is such a key thing for decision making.
It's the,

1584
01:26:17.951 --> 01:26:21.800
the,
I think the key thing there is,
is to make sure that you're not,

1585
01:26:21.830 --> 01:26:25.640
you're not clouded by this emotional attachment to plans,

1586
01:26:25.641 --> 01:26:27.950
which we often talk about with our leaders in the seal teams.

1587
01:26:28.370 --> 01:26:31.040
I'm emotionally invested in a plan that I came up with.

1588
01:26:31.041 --> 01:26:35.110
I spent hours or days or weeks or months,
you know,
in involved in,
uh,

1589
01:26:35.170 --> 01:26:38.810
and I want that to succeed,
of course,
but,
but is that,
you know,

1590
01:26:38.870 --> 01:26:40.670
I got to have that realistic assessment.

1591
01:26:40.671 --> 01:26:42.450
And that's what the detachment really requires,

1592
01:26:42.451 --> 01:26:47.451
is that you pull yourself not just physically away out of the weeds or to say,

1593
01:26:47.571 --> 01:26:49.970
okay,
let me think about this and the strategic picture.
But you really,

1594
01:26:50.210 --> 01:26:54.800
you take away that emotional investment that you have to maybe even whether it's

1595
01:26:54.801 --> 01:26:58.040
a plant,
sometimes it's a team member as well.
And if you have,
you know,

1596
01:26:58.180 --> 01:27:01.000
someone that you just have a close relationship with that you,
you know,

1597
01:27:01.220 --> 01:27:03.830
whether they're a relative of yours or you've had a longstanding relationship

1598
01:27:03.831 --> 01:27:07.030
with and that maybe you've gotten too close to them and you can't see that,

1599
01:27:07.290 --> 01:27:07.940
that you know,

1600
01:27:07.940 --> 01:27:10.400
they become more important than the mission and they're dragging the rest of the

1601
01:27:10.401 --> 01:27:10.940
team down.

1602
01:27:10.940 --> 01:27:14.060
You're not making the call either tightened them up or let them go with that.

1603
01:27:14.090 --> 01:27:14.751
That's the right case.

1604
01:27:14.751 --> 01:27:18.720
So I think what that really requires is you got to emotionally pulled back.
It's,

1605
01:27:18.721 --> 01:27:20.420
it's a,
it's a mental thing to,

1606
01:27:20.421 --> 01:27:24.410
to really have a brutally honest assessment of the situation.
Uh,
that's,

1607
01:27:24.440 --> 01:27:29.150
that's independent from any kind of a previous bias that you might've had.

1608
01:27:30.540 --> 01:27:33.900
<v 2>That's interesting there because even if you know,
like,
Oh yeah,</v>

1609
01:27:33.901 --> 01:27:38.430
I'm going to detach.
Oh,
it's not that easy.
Yeah.
Like go through the motions.

1610
01:27:38.550 --> 01:27:41.010
You can't be like,
Hey,
I'm going to detach them detached right now.
Meanwhile,

1611
01:27:41.011 --> 01:27:41.970
you're just,
like I said,

1612
01:27:41.971 --> 01:27:45.620
clouded by the emotional part that you're like kind of one foot in and

1613
01:27:45.630 --> 01:27:48.810
emotionally so you're technically not detached.
So it doesn't work.

1614
01:27:49.560 --> 01:27:52.740
You know what else is a good way to think is to listen.

1615
01:27:53.750 --> 01:27:57.480
Listen to what people are saying.
I've been thinking about how more,
how he said,

1616
01:27:58.170 --> 01:28:02.370
if you listen,
you know twice as much,

1617
01:28:02.880 --> 01:28:05.220
you know everything that you know and you know everything that the other guy

1618
01:28:05.221 --> 01:28:09.600
knows,
that's a great,
that's a great thing.
But if you're sitting in a,

1619
01:28:09.710 --> 01:28:13.000
in a conversation,
I mean from a business perspective,
if you're in a meeting and,

1620
01:28:13.001 --> 01:28:16.110
and there's a conversation going on,
if you're in the conversation,

1621
01:28:16.670 --> 01:28:20.390
you're talking and you're adding your piece,
well then you're,

1622
01:28:20.430 --> 01:28:22.710
you're not detached,
you're in it.

1623
01:28:23.160 --> 01:28:25.470
But if you sit back and you listen and you hear what's going on,

1624
01:28:25.471 --> 01:28:29.640
you can assemble,
you know?
Fobts better.
So,

1625
01:28:31.300 --> 01:28:32.550
all right,
next.

1626
01:28:32.970 --> 01:28:37.320
When can we expect any books to come out by either of you and what are they

1627
01:28:37.321 --> 01:28:40.560
going to be like?
Extreme ownership or way of the warrior kid.

1628
01:28:41.040 --> 01:28:43.680
So I also had a book out called discipline equals freedom.

1629
01:28:43.710 --> 01:28:45.720
It's a field manual by the way.
Sure.

1630
01:28:45.810 --> 01:28:49.230
You familiar with field manual Naco you claim to be familiar with field manual

1631
01:28:49.231 --> 01:28:51.130
and his favorite kind of manual.
Okay.

1632
01:28:53.070 --> 01:28:55.920
Way The warrior kid too is coming out in April.

1633
01:28:57.150 --> 01:29:02.100
It's called Mark's mission.
And we are in the process writing,
Leif Babin.

1634
01:29:02.130 --> 01:29:05.040
<v 3>Tell me about that.
Yes,
we are.
We're getting after a second book right now.</v>

1635
01:29:05.041 --> 01:29:09.200
It's a follow on book,
two extreme ownership and a,
I'm super excited about.
It's,

1636
01:29:09.210 --> 01:29:09.840
it's a,

1637
01:29:09.840 --> 01:29:13.650
it's going to be in the same format when we talk about combat combat lessons

1638
01:29:13.680 --> 01:29:16.770
learned on the battlefield or in training and then a principal and then as

1639
01:29:16.771 --> 01:29:18.580
application of the business squirreled,
uh,

1640
01:29:18.710 --> 01:29:22.080
and the same in the same format as extreme ownership.
And what it really is,

1641
01:29:22.081 --> 01:29:26.550
is it's to answer all of the questions and difficulties that people have from

1642
01:29:26.551 --> 01:29:30.210
applying the principles.
We get these common questions all the time.
I'm like,

1643
01:29:30.211 --> 01:29:33.840
okay,
I'm having this issue and okay,
you said taking ownership here,
but,
but,
uh,

1644
01:29:33.841 --> 01:29:36.840
what does that really mean and error?
How do I apply a cover moved,
you know,

1645
01:29:36.841 --> 01:29:41.690
to my team.
Uh,
these,
uh,
it's going to dive much deeper into that.
And,
uh,

1646
01:29:41.730 --> 01:29:44.610
it's,
uh,
it's going to be also gonna be coming out fall of 2018.

1647
01:29:44.690 --> 01:29:48.950
<v 0>How do you feel about writing a sequel?
It's a,</v>

1648
01:29:49.100 --> 01:29:52.610
it's not a sequel.
It's going to be a standalone book on its own.

1649
01:29:53.460 --> 01:29:57.740
It's going to be good.
Okay.
I,
I,
I think it's nerve wracking because,

1650
01:29:57.741 --> 01:30:01.380
you know what,
have you ever seen the movie jaws?
Yes.
Yes.

1651
01:30:01.430 --> 01:30:04.820
That's one of my favorite movies.
Have you ever seen the movie jaws too?

1652
01:30:06.260 --> 01:30:08.320
Yes,
we got issues with jaws too.

1653
01:30:08.630 --> 01:30:13.220
We got issues and this is what I think.
So I think,

1654
01:30:13.760 --> 01:30:17.360
again,
I'll call it luck,
maybe not,
but I call it luck.

1655
01:30:17.840 --> 01:30:19.490
Luckily for us,

1656
01:30:19.550 --> 01:30:24.550
this book has sold really well that if we would've written a sequel a year after

1657
01:30:27.861 --> 01:30:31.430
this book came out,
it would have been jaws too,
to be honest with you.

1658
01:30:32.060 --> 01:30:34.370
But luckily during,

1659
01:30:34.400 --> 01:30:38.220
because now it's been two years since this came out.
So we've had,
uh,
and,

1660
01:30:38.230 --> 01:30:41.810
and by the way,
a followup year,
if we were to re released a book,

1661
01:30:41.960 --> 01:30:44.790
if the is going released another book,
released another book,
you will,

1662
01:30:44.791 --> 01:30:46.040
we'll pay you more money.
That's what they do.

1663
01:30:46.041 --> 01:30:48.140
They want you to really start a book.
Now we got some hype from this book,

1664
01:30:48.141 --> 01:30:50.960
we'll get another one out there and life.
And I were like,
well no,
not right now.

1665
01:30:52.040 --> 01:30:56.900
Just stop and we'll let time we write another book.

1666
01:30:56.901 --> 01:31:00.170
Well I did write another book,
but they're not the same.
Right.
We don't want,

1667
01:31:00.171 --> 01:31:03.650
we want,
we don't want to make jaws too.
So we let time go.

1668
01:31:03.651 --> 01:31:06.680
And guess what we were doing all the time that we,
that we had passed,
right?

1669
01:31:06.950 --> 01:31:09.200
We weren't sitting around.
No,
we were working with more companies.

1670
01:31:09.290 --> 01:31:10.670
We're working with more military units.

1671
01:31:10.760 --> 01:31:13.340
We were working with police were working firefighters,
we were having the muster,

1672
01:31:13.341 --> 01:31:15.080
we were learning more and more lessons.

1673
01:31:15.200 --> 01:31:19.910
And we were getting feedback from this book and saying,
okay,
I see some threads.

1674
01:31:19.911 --> 01:31:22.400
And at first it was one little thread and there was another little thread and

1675
01:31:22.401 --> 01:31:26.720
now all of a sudden all those threads come together and you get something,

1676
01:31:26.870 --> 01:31:28.490
you get,
you get a fabric.

1677
01:31:29.420 --> 01:31:34.420
And that's what we waited for is let's get something that is a woven fabric is

1678
01:31:35.721 --> 01:31:38.690
gonna be strong.
Like Calphalon.
So the next book that we got coming out,

1679
01:31:40.400 --> 01:31:42.560
I disagree with you that it's a standalone book.

1680
01:31:42.561 --> 01:31:45.500
I don't think it's a standalone book.
Are you going to retract your statement?

1681
01:31:45.550 --> 01:31:49.930
I'm gonna give you a chance.
You should I do check my statement because,

1682
01:31:49.931 --> 01:31:53.360
because it is,
I mean,
the new book,
I thought you were setting me up for a,
uh,

1683
01:31:53.420 --> 01:31:57.090
an ambush them.
No,
no.
It's,

1684
01:31:58.670 --> 01:32:00.250
I'm sure can read the new book

1685
01:32:00.610 --> 01:32:03.250
<v 2>on you're on its own,
but you shouldn't,</v>

1686
01:32:03.490 --> 01:32:07.720
you should read extreme ownership first and then you read the new book and when

1687
01:32:07.721 --> 01:32:09.490
you read a new book,
it's going to,
again,

1688
01:32:09.491 --> 01:32:12.610
all those threads are going to weave together and,
and,
and

1689
01:32:14.200 --> 01:32:15.520
they're going to be the perfect,
it's going to be,

1690
01:32:15.640 --> 01:32:18.250
they're going to compliment each other.
Amazing.
An amazing way.

1691
01:32:18.400 --> 01:32:22.210
I think that's in that and that method or an for from that perspective.

1692
01:32:22.211 --> 01:32:26.000
Absolutely.
I think absolutely it is.
It is a sequel net perspective.
It,

1693
01:32:26.180 --> 01:32:29.560
it will be written in a way that,
that you can read it as a standalone book for,

1694
01:32:29.590 --> 01:32:31.900
for sure.
Uh,
it will certainly reference,
uh,
you know,

1695
01:32:31.901 --> 01:32:34.420
the things that we talked about in extreme ownership and the foundational

1696
01:32:34.421 --> 01:32:36.880
principles of home would say that that's a written,

1697
01:32:37.300 --> 01:32:41.160
I think there are a few exceptions.
Don't do your jaws analogy and excellent.

1698
01:32:41.620 --> 01:32:42.280
I mean,

1699
01:32:42.280 --> 01:32:47.080
I can think that Indiana Jones and the temple of Doom Terminator Terminator two

1700
01:32:47.110 --> 01:32:49.900
Judgment Day,
but it doesn't have a lot to do with how you said,
hey,

1701
01:32:49.901 --> 01:32:52.000
let's wait a little bit.
Yeah,
that's true.

1702
01:32:52.570 --> 01:32:56.560
Unless the whole story that you going to dust the difference.
Cause if you just,

1703
01:32:56.590 --> 01:33:00.760
Oh,
we had a hit movie.
Make another one.
Right,
right.
Yeah.
That's a good title.

1704
01:33:00.940 --> 01:33:05.600
Jaws wasn't hit.
Let's make another one.
We'll call it jaws to yeah.

1705
01:33:05.890 --> 01:33:09.070
If they would've waited,
like terminate,
they waited at what,
eight years or so,

1706
01:33:09.370 --> 01:33:12.010
then it's like,
okay,
a lot of things are updated,
a lot of new stuff.

1707
01:33:12.011 --> 01:33:15.390
They figured it out and it's like you were saying that boom terminated two just

1708
01:33:15.391 --> 01:33:17.740
as good aliens,
aliens.

1709
01:33:18.710 --> 01:33:20.710
The first movie was that pretty quick afterwards,

1710
01:33:20.830 --> 01:33:25.350
the second movie aliens crossed the first movie.
Really?
Eh,
I,
I,

1711
01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:30.400
to be totally honest,
it's a gamble though.
No,
I actually,
I don't know cause I'm,

1712
01:33:30.990 --> 01:33:34.240
I'm halfway,
a little bit more than halfway done with my writing part,

1713
01:33:34.270 --> 01:33:38.960
right before we start editing each other.
I think,
I think we might have an,
uh,

1714
01:33:39.220 --> 01:33:42.970
a SQL that's better.
I Dunno,
I have a suspicion that this equals better,

1715
01:33:43.270 --> 01:33:45.880
possibly better.
So I think so too.

1716
01:33:45.881 --> 01:33:48.940
It's been super fun to write know as we're doing a,
I think,
as you said,

1717
01:33:48.941 --> 01:33:50.980
are our knowledge is so much more now.
I mean,
we,

1718
01:33:51.220 --> 01:33:54.680
our knowledge of the business world was,
was,
you know,
we,

1719
01:33:54.681 --> 01:33:55.900
we'd been working for a couple of,
you know,

1720
01:33:55.901 --> 01:33:58.360
two or three years in the business world at that point.
Uh,
but,

1721
01:33:58.390 --> 01:34:01.120
but now we've got double more than double that and yeah,

1722
01:34:01.280 --> 01:34:02.970
and the region expansion of,
of,

1723
01:34:02.980 --> 01:34:06.430
of what we've been doing since the release of extreme ownership is it's a

1724
01:34:06.431 --> 01:34:10.600
hundred x what we were doing previously.
So,
uh,
that's just given us,

1725
01:34:10.601 --> 01:34:15.010
it's been a massive education and our knowledge of how to apply these things

1726
01:34:15.011 --> 01:34:18.790
across the spectrum,
yeah.
Is Incredibly,
um,
uh,
so much,

1727
01:34:18.850 --> 01:34:22.440
so much deeper than than it was previously.
And,
and um,
I'm,
I'm excited about it.

1728
01:34:22.630 --> 01:34:24.190
Yeah.
It's going to be good.

1729
01:34:25.540 --> 01:34:30.100
Next question is how long does it take to prepare for a muster?
And when,

1730
01:34:30.101 --> 01:34:31.780
when we read this question earlier,

1731
01:34:32.140 --> 01:34:35.200
I thought it was the person asking how long it would take this individual,

1732
01:34:35.201 --> 01:34:39.810
me or whoever,
uh,
a person out in the world to get ready to go to the muster.

1733
01:34:40.010 --> 01:34:44.770
Oh yeah.
And the answer to that is it doesn't take you any time.
You just,
I mean,

1734
01:34:44.771 --> 01:34:48.430
you should read extreme ownership for sure,
but there's no,
like big physical,

1735
01:34:49.190 --> 01:34:50.800
there's physical things that you do with the muster,

1736
01:34:50.890 --> 01:34:53.200
but they're scaled that anybody can do them.
So it's really,

1737
01:34:53.201 --> 01:34:57.290
you don't need to do any major preparation other than put your ego in check.

1738
01:34:57.770 --> 01:34:59.470
I didn't think it's preparation you need is,

1739
01:34:59.471 --> 01:35:03.710
is to look at yourself in the mirror and,
and write down that,

1740
01:35:03.711 --> 01:35:06.080
that where you're weakest and where you need to work.
I mean,

1741
01:35:06.081 --> 01:35:08.330
that's what we want to talk about it.
I don't care where you're doing great.

1742
01:35:08.660 --> 01:35:09.770
We're not there to patch on the back.

1743
01:35:09.771 --> 01:35:12.950
We want to care like where you can get better and everyone can get better.

1744
01:35:13.280 --> 01:35:15.260
Certainly you can prove all the time and I think that's what you need to do.

1745
01:35:15.440 --> 01:35:17.900
I thought this question was about how we prepped for the muster,

1746
01:35:18.110 --> 01:35:21.200
which is it's always about,
which is substantial always about life.

1747
01:35:21.920 --> 01:35:26.320
It's all about me all the time.
It's,
it's,

1748
01:35:26.370 --> 01:35:30.290
it is a ton of work to prepare for the monster,
but it's fun.
Yeah,
it's fun.
It's,

1749
01:35:30.340 --> 01:35:34.760
it's great.
We do it.
A random question.

1750
01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:39.380
In your experience,
have you had or do you see high injury rates in Jujitsu?

1751
01:35:40.310 --> 01:35:45.050
Want to start rolling again but don't want to disrupt progress on the Barbell,

1752
01:35:45.540 --> 01:35:49.340
Barb?
Oh yeah,
sure.
Well,
it's possible.

1753
01:35:49.610 --> 01:35:54.320
I am being a weak suck,
although not probable

1754
01:35:55.850 --> 01:36:00.720
risk assessment.
What do you think?
Can you get injured in Jujitsu?
Yes.
Yeah.
Look,

1755
01:36:00.780 --> 01:36:03.470
just like he can injured.
Even been injured,
playing basketball.
She,

1756
01:36:03.471 --> 01:36:07.280
you'll get injured playing basketball quicker than you did two events as far as

1757
01:36:07.281 --> 01:36:09.590
it goes.
Yeah,
I will.
I the the,

1758
01:36:09.620 --> 01:36:13.820
the key part about this question for me is you want to keep making progress on

1759
01:36:13.821 --> 01:36:17.210
the Barbell,
right?
Yeah.
So you want to keep getting stronger.
That's cool.

1760
01:36:17.300 --> 01:36:20.000
I want you to be stronger,
but if you're super strong,

1761
01:36:20.001 --> 01:36:22.510
you didn't know how to fight.
I got nothing for you.
Yeah.

1762
01:36:22.820 --> 01:36:25.700
That's a deeper thing too.
And keep this in mind though,

1763
01:36:25.701 --> 01:36:27.560
and this goes for any it physical activity.

1764
01:36:27.561 --> 01:36:32.180
Like if your goal physically is this thing and then you start going hard in

1765
01:36:32.360 --> 01:36:36.830
another direction,
it could very well take away from you.

1766
01:36:36.920 --> 01:36:40.780
You're not going to reach your maximum potential as a weightlifter if you're

1767
01:36:40.790 --> 01:36:43.700
doing Jujitsu for sure.
Swimming or swimming or anything else about ever.
Yeah.

1768
01:36:43.870 --> 01:36:46.670
You got to find a balance.
But I mean,
what's the most important?

1769
01:36:46.671 --> 01:36:47.930
What's a more important skill to have?

1770
01:36:48.440 --> 01:36:53.440
Be able to snatch big weight or be able to defend yourself in a street fight.

1771
01:36:54.500 --> 01:36:56.570
Hey,
the snatching big weight's going to help you defend yourself.

1772
01:36:57.080 --> 01:36:59.580
We appreciate that we're fans.
Yeah.

1773
01:37:00.110 --> 01:37:05.110
But prioritize now what's interesting is on a daily basis,

1774
01:37:05.660 --> 01:37:07.160
I always work out,

1775
01:37:07.790 --> 01:37:11.450
but I don't always do Jujitsu because you can't,
you need,

1776
01:37:11.451 --> 01:37:13.190
you need someone to train with.
You know what I mean?

1777
01:37:13.191 --> 01:37:15.530
Like he need somebody to do Jujitsu with you,
can't you just,
you're by yourself.

1778
01:37:16.020 --> 01:37:18.470
So sometimes you don't have anyone to train with.
Look,

1779
01:37:18.471 --> 01:37:22.220
I think from my perspective as a,
as a white belt,
it's,
it's,
uh,
I,

1780
01:37:22.221 --> 01:37:26.410
I've trained enough,
if you've gotta be getting close to that Blue Bouche will,

1781
01:37:26.420 --> 01:37:29.610
uh,
I got a lot,
lot more work to do.
Certainly a lot more to it.

1782
01:37:29.830 --> 01:37:32.660
It's not up to him and you guys.
Yeah,
that's true.
You guys have inspired me.

1783
01:37:32.661 --> 01:37:34.580
I'm trying to turn it hard.
Got A,
got a great place.

1784
01:37:34.581 --> 01:37:38.540
I'm turning down in Texas now.
John John Machado.
Austin's awesome.
Yeah.

1785
01:37:38.700 --> 01:37:39.810
Todd white collar,
white sauce today.

1786
01:37:40.270 --> 01:37:45.120
If you're the type of people that train in there,
I mean,
it's,
and that's,

1787
01:37:45.170 --> 01:37:46.300
that's what I like about it.
That's that.

1788
01:37:46.310 --> 01:37:48.710
That's the same thing that the place I tried to New York,

1789
01:37:48.711 --> 01:37:52.010
it's just that to me has,
uh,

1790
01:37:52.520 --> 01:37:54.470
I think if you're constantly getting injured all the time,

1791
01:37:54.471 --> 01:37:55.710
like you're not training with the right people

1792
01:37:55.980 --> 01:37:56.910
<v 4>and you're not training in the,</v>

1793
01:37:56.911 --> 01:37:59.790
in the right manner of something that I learned years ago.

1794
01:37:59.791 --> 01:38:03.600
And when I was on the boxing team,
the Naval Academy,
me and my buddies,
you know,

1795
01:38:03.601 --> 01:38:05.520
who were kind of scrubs,
we didn't travel with the team,

1796
01:38:05.521 --> 01:38:08.220
but we just beat the piss out of each other every,
every day.

1797
01:38:08.640 --> 01:38:11.490
And no one could breathe out of their nose at.
Everyone had black eyes.

1798
01:38:11.491 --> 01:38:15.630
And he watched the guy who was the guys who were really skilled.
They smart,

1799
01:38:15.631 --> 01:38:17.130
but they were working on form.
There were,
you know,
they,

1800
01:38:17.131 --> 01:38:21.090
they weren't just knocking each other's heads off every punch,
every time,

1801
01:38:21.091 --> 01:38:24.960
you know,
every single day.
And I think that's,
that's where you have to,

1802
01:38:24.961 --> 01:38:27.660
it's great to train hard,
but I think you need to train smart and I think you,

1803
01:38:27.661 --> 01:38:28.950
you need to,
the biggest thing,

1804
01:38:28.980 --> 01:38:33.030
I'm guessing this person is probably hasn't trained that much so that they,

1805
01:38:33.360 --> 01:38:36.990
they spin out Dave Burke and I were just rolling here at victory last night.

1806
01:38:37.410 --> 01:38:42.120
And uh,
I was,
uh,
I was,
I was telling,
telling Dave,
you know,

1807
01:38:42.121 --> 01:38:45.540
Dave,
he's made some progress,
has been training out in Virginia.
I was like,

1808
01:38:45.541 --> 01:38:46.710
cool man,
you're doing good.
But he's,

1809
01:38:46.711 --> 01:38:51.030
he gets so amped up that he can't detach so he can't detach because he's,

1810
01:38:51.240 --> 01:38:52.360
he's gets so amped up and it's,

1811
01:38:52.620 --> 01:38:55.470
I realized I used to just be in that I've trained enough now,

1812
01:38:55.800 --> 01:38:57.090
I still might be the white belts.
She,

1813
01:38:57.091 --> 01:39:01.020
but I've trained it enough now to know that,
uh,
that I've got,
uh,

1814
01:39:01.170 --> 01:39:05.310
I've got to the throttle that back.
Cause it's,
you get so focused,
right.

1815
01:39:05.350 --> 01:39:08.610
I'm going to focus on my one little white built American.
I'm trying to get it,

1816
01:39:08.880 --> 01:39:11.190
you know,
or arm bar versus versus like,
no,

1817
01:39:11.191 --> 01:39:15.950
detach and think for this looks like four or five
with him.

1818
01:39:17.070 --> 01:39:20.990
Yeah,
we did like,
yeah.
So he,
it was funny because we were rolling around it.

1819
01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:23.230
I mean,
he is,
uh,
uh,

1820
01:39:23.260 --> 01:39:28.000
and at one point I'm like laughing at him because he's literally like
that,

1821
01:39:28.040 --> 01:39:32.320
that kind of briefly like Dave [inaudible] was like,
you know,
when you breathe,

1822
01:39:32.340 --> 01:39:34.080
when you feel,
hear somebody breathing hard like that,

1823
01:39:34.081 --> 01:39:36.840
typically it's like when you're there,
right in your ear,
so it's,

1824
01:39:36.940 --> 01:39:39.920
it sounds way more intense.
They,
what about the tie?

1825
01:39:39.921 --> 01:39:41.730
It could have been also because I had a little,
little,

1826
01:39:41.910 --> 01:39:46.410
little elbow pressure will go up to the time period when you're like kind of

1827
01:39:46.411 --> 01:39:50.730
starting Jujitsu and Dave Burke might be in this situation right now.
It's,

1828
01:39:50.740 --> 01:39:55.560
it's the very early end Jujitsu where in your mind you think like,

1829
01:39:55.980 --> 01:40:00.300
you know what,
like I'll be able to,
I think I'll be able to get like Jocko,
right?

1830
01:40:02.060 --> 01:40:04.520
Like I'll be like,
hey man,
I evict.

1831
01:40:04.550 --> 01:40:06.060
They let him some little move and they're like,
Oh,

1832
01:40:06.061 --> 01:40:09.120
if I throw this Ajiaco at the right time at this black belt,

1833
01:40:09.121 --> 01:40:11.880
the right time won't be able to get them.
You know what I'm saying?

1834
01:40:13.990 --> 01:40:18.860
For sure I had with Dean one time.
Yeah.
I mean what I,

1835
01:40:19.200 --> 01:40:22.110
when you're amped up to that level though,
you know,
and yeah,

1836
01:40:22.111 --> 01:40:24.370
you with your thinking that like no one can tap me or,

1837
01:40:24.400 --> 01:40:26.520
and I don't think Dave's is in that and that mode,

1838
01:40:26.710 --> 01:40:29.960
he's learned enough maybe to be,
be beyond that.
But it's,

1839
01:40:30.310 --> 01:40:33.650
it's when you're that amped up,
your chances of,

1840
01:40:34.010 --> 01:40:37.790
of getting injured or way worse,
just more significant.
It's why,
you know,

1841
01:40:37.820 --> 01:40:39.160
if you see a brand new white belt coming,

1842
01:40:39.190 --> 01:40:41.990
I'd much rather roll with Brown belts and purpose blue,

1843
01:40:42.180 --> 01:40:44.580
even though I know they're gonna,
you know,
they're going to get the best of me.

1844
01:40:44.790 --> 01:40:45.170
Uh,

1845
01:40:45.170 --> 01:40:48.840
I have a much less chance of getting injured then just the death match with some

1846
01:40:48.841 --> 01:40:52.820
white belt who's,
you know,
who doesn't even know,
you know,
anything.
And,
and,

1847
01:40:52.821 --> 01:40:54.040
and so I think

1848
01:40:54.040 --> 01:40:56.470
<v 5>you've gotta be smart about who you trained with.
And that's what I love about,</v>

1849
01:40:56.471 --> 01:40:59.320
you know,
uh,
genres up,
Machado Austin with,
with Todd white does guys,
they're,

1850
01:40:59.321 --> 01:41:02.470
they're there,
they're super,
you know,
they're very knowledgeable.

1851
01:41:02.471 --> 01:41:04.330
They pass on stuff with her humble,
just,
just like,

1852
01:41:04.360 --> 01:41:06.940
just like folks here if victory.
I mean it,
it's,
uh,

1853
01:41:07.420 --> 01:41:09.580
and I think when you're training with the right people,
they're like,
oh,
cool,

1854
01:41:09.581 --> 01:41:12.580
you got,
you got me in an arm bar.
You've got to know that choke was great.

1855
01:41:12.581 --> 01:41:14.090
Show me how to do that.
And it's,
it's,
uh,

1856
01:41:14.350 --> 01:41:16.690
but it's a humble learning environment where,
you know,

1857
01:41:16.691 --> 01:41:18.880
you're not there to injure people,
you're not there to get hurt.

1858
01:41:18.881 --> 01:41:22.360
And I think it's sure you're going to get tweaks and,
and bumps and bruises,

1859
01:41:22.930 --> 01:41:26.890
but I think there's,
you know,
if you're training smartly and training to learn,

1860
01:41:26.920 --> 01:41:30.630
then a,
the chance of getting injured,
the probability is much less.
My boy,

1861
01:41:30.631 --> 01:41:35.020
Todd [inaudible],
Todd white,
he's like old school Jiujitsu guy and he,

1862
01:41:35.470 --> 01:41:39.910
me and him were on the circuit.
Burke,
the competence to back in the day,

1863
01:41:39.930 --> 01:41:44.230
he was La John Jacques Guy.
And,
and he,
by the way,

1864
01:41:44.231 --> 01:41:48.280
he listens to the podcast by the way.
La Payments were fully,
yeah,

1865
01:41:48.281 --> 01:41:53.170
they were back in the day.
All right.
Um,
in addition to that,
the Jujitsu,

1866
01:41:53.230 --> 01:41:57.040
what even like,
I wouldn't want to paint the picture of that.

1867
01:41:57.041 --> 01:42:00.620
Like all white belts are going to increase your chance of injury.
It's a,

1868
01:42:00.640 --> 01:42:04.600
it's kind of a specific type of person that will increase your chance of injury

1869
01:42:04.601 --> 01:42:09.601
and that's like a guy who's strong may or may not have like this eagle where you

1870
01:42:10.691 --> 01:42:13.570
can't tell me and I'm going to try to kick you every single time.
For sure.

1871
01:42:13.840 --> 01:42:14.740
And he,

1872
01:42:14.800 --> 01:42:19.800
he has like an element of like legitimate strength lettuces.

1873
01:42:22.110 --> 01:42:25.630
So you've got to put all those together.
Like you go into a typical gym,
all,

1874
01:42:25.631 --> 01:42:29.260
you take all the white belt,
you may not even have a guy like that.
That's true.

1875
01:42:30.060 --> 01:42:33.250
The probability of a guy being like that is pretty low.
I'm not saying

1876
01:42:34.750 --> 01:42:36.970
there might be higher products,
pretty low.

1877
01:42:37.120 --> 01:42:41.290
Depends on what the changes that though,
in my opinion,
what changes is the,

1878
01:42:41.291 --> 01:42:44.320
is the black belt instructor like someone's like,
Oh,

1879
01:42:44.321 --> 01:42:46.120
you want to get tough with that guy over there?
We'll let,
let me,

1880
01:42:46.790 --> 01:42:50.190
I'm going to impose some humility on you.
It's called regulation.
It has to be,

1881
01:42:50.191 --> 01:42:50.411
yeah.

1882
01:42:50.411 --> 01:42:55.411
Which is yet another factor that kind of contributes to the overall safety of

1883
01:42:55.991 --> 01:42:58.990
it.
So,
and I'm not saying low,
like they're rare and nothing like that.

1884
01:42:59.110 --> 01:43:02.950
What I'm saying,
if you take a just,
I don't know,
some random class,
uh,

1885
01:43:04.060 --> 01:43:04.360
uh,

1886
01:43:04.360 --> 01:43:09.360
new white belt spazzy strong maybe may or may not be young with like a huge ego.

1887
01:43:10.780 --> 01:43:14.530
Maybe one guy,
maybe you won't get a class full of though.

1888
01:43:15.300 --> 01:43:20.170
So your day to day rolling is,
is pretty safe.
You know what I mean?
Yeah.

1889
01:43:20.500 --> 01:43:24.130
You do need to pick your training partners carefully for sure.

1890
01:43:24.200 --> 01:43:26.940
But to this guy though.
[inaudible] I mean,

1891
01:43:27.190 --> 01:43:32.170
look back when I go way back,
I think I probably knew echo even before,

1892
01:43:32.620 --> 01:43:35.900
before you did Jacqueline in our a surface warfare days are good,

1893
01:43:35.910 --> 01:43:39.400
good Fred cake nuts who's a mutual friend and,
and others that we've uh,

1894
01:43:39.730 --> 01:43:42.500
kicked me,
we work with.
In fact,
echo was,
you were,

1895
01:43:42.550 --> 01:43:44.620
he was a bouncer downtown before I'd,

1896
01:43:44.740 --> 01:43:49.740
everyone knows cause he talks about he had to put up with all our shenanigans in

1897
01:43:50.180 --> 01:43:52.250
trouble.
Yes.
But I remember

1898
01:43:52.250 --> 01:43:55.940
<v 3>coming in here and training it victory and echo was a blue belt and showing me</v>

1899
01:43:55.941 --> 01:43:57.920
and cake nuts like some moves and,
and,
and,
and,

1900
01:43:58.190 --> 01:44:01.430
and because I kind of had this mentality of the guy who asked this question of

1901
01:44:01.431 --> 01:44:02.000
like,
you know,

1902
01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:06.140
you might get injured and I was focused on other things and I trained you're all

1903
01:44:06.141 --> 01:44:10.260
the time.
And a lot of times I'd be here to work out and I,
I do stand up,
uh,

1904
01:44:10.340 --> 01:44:12.380
and I would never,
I never trained Jujitsu.

1905
01:44:12.381 --> 01:44:16.130
Like I should have never stuck with it consistently didn't have the discipline

1906
01:44:16.370 --> 01:44:18.920
to do that.
Uh,
for whatever reason,

1907
01:44:18.921 --> 01:44:20.870
I get pulled in different directions and you know,

1908
01:44:21.200 --> 01:44:24.460
here we are 10 or 12 years later and echoes of Brown belt.

1909
01:44:24.461 --> 01:44:25.880
He knocking on the door of a,

1910
01:44:26.230 --> 01:44:29.620
I'm getting his black belt and I'm still a white belt.
What doors he knocking on?

1911
01:44:29.720 --> 01:44:32.200
I'm not knocking on door getting knocked on this matter.

1912
01:44:32.990 --> 01:44:37.670
I don't think about their silence out there,
so don't be that guy.
I think,
uh,

1913
01:44:37.730 --> 01:44:42.440
I would make the time to train pretty good.
So,
yeah,
for sure.
All right.

1914
01:44:42.890 --> 01:44:46.910
<v 0>Losing a teammate,
both military and civilian civilian world happens.</v>

1915
01:44:47.360 --> 01:44:51.110
How do you assist and promote healing and growth within a team that has lost a

1916
01:44:51.111 --> 01:44:52.040
pivotal member?

1917
01:44:53.090 --> 01:44:57.920
What do you do when the emotional toll leaves your guys' unfocused and is

1918
01:44:57.921 --> 01:45:00.410
creating unacceptable risks?

1919
01:45:06.320 --> 01:45:08.510
Yeah.
Um,
you know,
I've talked about this,

1920
01:45:08.511 --> 01:45:12.560
this before and I think obviously in this can happen,

1921
01:45:12.620 --> 01:45:17.620
this is part of life is death and people are gonna die and you obviously we're

1922
01:45:18.321 --> 01:45:21.050
all going to deal with,
they're all going to face it at some time.
You know,

1923
01:45:21.051 --> 01:45:23.420
work environment.
How do you deal with it?

1924
01:45:23.750 --> 01:45:28.190
One of the things that I always say is get back to work,

1925
01:45:28.490 --> 01:45:31.250
right?
You're,
yes,
you're going to mourn.
Yes,

1926
01:45:31.251 --> 01:45:32.780
you're going to have your memorial services,

1927
01:45:33.860 --> 01:45:38.690
and then you got to get back to work.
And I think if you let people,

1928
01:45:39.350 --> 01:45:42.730
if you give them too much time off,
if you let them sit around,
um,

1929
01:45:42.830 --> 01:45:46.310
they're going to get unfocused.
They're going to start thinking about,
you know,

1930
01:45:46.311 --> 01:45:48.180
they're gonna start thinking about things that are,

1931
01:45:48.280 --> 01:45:52.150
are not good to think about because we want to,
yes,
we want a more,

1932
01:45:52.260 --> 01:45:55.520
we want to do the,
we want to remember.
But at the same time,

1933
01:45:55.521 --> 01:45:56.780
and I say this all the time,
we don't want to do well.

1934
01:45:57.560 --> 01:46:02.090
You don't want to dwell in the past.
You want to remember,
but don't dwell.

1935
01:46:02.120 --> 01:46:06.470
So I say,
get back to work.
Going back to what we talked about earlier,

1936
01:46:06.471 --> 01:46:08.000
find out what your next mission is going to be.

1937
01:46:08.180 --> 01:46:13.180
You have more of a reason to achieve your mission because you lost someone that

1938
01:46:14.510 --> 01:46:16.940
you lost.
Someone that can't kick,

1939
01:46:16.941 --> 01:46:19.700
that can no longer carry on with their mission.

1940
01:46:20.480 --> 01:46:25.370
So for them,
carry on with your mission.
Go forward.
Don't dwell in the past.

1941
01:46:25.640 --> 01:46:29.030
Anybody that you asked that you cared about,
what would they want you to do?

1942
01:46:29.360 --> 01:46:33.230
Would they want you to sit around and sulk and look at the ground?
No,

1943
01:46:33.470 --> 01:46:36.260
they'd want you to get your gear,

1944
01:46:36.950 --> 01:46:40.520
get your mindset straight and get back after it.

1945
01:46:41.180 --> 01:46:42.320
So that's what I recommend.

1946
01:46:42.870 --> 01:46:46.560
<v 3>I think that's,
that's exactly right.
And I think getting a work,
uh,</v>

1947
01:46:46.561 --> 01:46:50.340
the reason that's important is if people,
if

1948
01:46:50.340 --> 01:46:53.460
<v 4>that person died,
you know,
in,
for the guys that we lost,
I get,
if we just,</v>

1949
01:46:53.610 --> 01:46:58.090
if we just gave up and walked away,
that means they died in vain for nothing.
And,

1950
01:46:58.100 --> 01:47:01.020
and we're not gonna do that.
We're going to,
we're going to double a triple,

1951
01:47:01.021 --> 01:47:03.510
quadruple down on that mission to make sure that we win,

1952
01:47:03.900 --> 01:47:05.730
that their sacrifices weren't,
weren't advantage.

1953
01:47:05.731 --> 01:47:09.100
I think that's helping the team understand,
uh,

1954
01:47:09.120 --> 01:47:11.760
what you're accomplishing and why they're doing what they're doing is,

1955
01:47:11.761 --> 01:47:13.200
is incredibly important.

1956
01:47:13.500 --> 01:47:16.530
And we wrote about that and extreme ownership and talk about it all the time.

1957
01:47:16.540 --> 01:47:16.651
That,

1958
01:47:16.651 --> 01:47:19.900
that understanding why briefing the team and helping them understand why it is

1959
01:47:19.901 --> 01:47:23.750
critical,
but yeah,
focused on accomplishing that mission is,
uh,

1960
01:47:23.970 --> 01:47:24.661
is what you gotta do.

1961
01:47:24.661 --> 01:47:27.600
I think the other thing too is you'll do everything you can to take care of
that,

1962
01:47:27.660 --> 01:47:31.980
that,
that person and their family take care of their family and help them out.

1963
01:47:31.981 --> 01:47:34.170
And you know,
that's an obligation that never goes away.

1964
01:47:34.440 --> 01:47:35.940
Now you're always going to have a,

1965
01:47:35.960 --> 01:47:38.790
and that's extremely important and something that's,
uh,

1966
01:47:38.791 --> 01:47:42.270
that's helped me through those difficult losses is by serving others and
looking,

1967
01:47:42.300 --> 01:47:46.350
trying to look out for others.
Uh,
and I got to do that even more than I do.

1968
01:47:50.340 --> 01:47:51.840
Um,
you know,

1969
01:47:52.170 --> 01:47:56.820
another thing that can help out in those dark times is a little bit of Jujitsu

1970
01:47:56.910 --> 01:48:00.120
to be quite frank with you.
Next question's about Jujitsu.
Again,

1971
01:48:01.560 --> 01:48:03.390
my BJJ coach knows it all.

1972
01:48:04.020 --> 01:48:07.920
The problem is he's a know it all condescending,

1973
01:48:08.220 --> 01:48:12.720
insulting,
derogatory comments to students while class is in session.

1974
01:48:13.530 --> 01:48:16.890
Option A,
stay option B,

1975
01:48:16.980 --> 01:48:21.980
go to a school down the road with less experienced but much more mature minded

1976
01:48:22.230 --> 01:48:26.610
teacher.
What would jack would do?
What would life do?
What would echo do?

1977
01:48:29.380 --> 01:48:31.070
<v 1>I would probably move.
Okay,</v>

1978
01:48:33.320 --> 01:48:37.350
<v 4>fair enough.
It's straightforward to depends how,
maybe not that straight fans,</v>

1979
01:48:37.351 --> 01:48:41.360
how much less experienced though.
Yeah.
Okay.
But,
but purple belt,

1980
01:48:41.361 --> 01:48:46.190
Brown belt it move.
If I'm just beginning white belt,
whatever.
Yeah.
Oof.
Okay.

1981
01:48:47.240 --> 01:48:51.020
Leif Babin yeah.
Look it as,
as a white belt myself that I learned from,

1982
01:48:51.140 --> 01:48:54.080
there's amazing purple belts in Brown belts out there.
You know,

1983
01:48:54.290 --> 01:48:57.890
I've learned a ton from you after you always show up,
show me stuff.
And,
and you,

1984
01:48:58.160 --> 01:49:01.160
you have a great knack for teaching,
which is getting,
you know,
people,

1985
01:49:01.161 --> 01:49:04.980
some people just don't have that as much.
And I think,
uh,
um,
yeah,
I think that's,

1986
01:49:05.120 --> 01:49:09.290
if you're at the white belt level,
that's,
that's great.
So,
uh,
I think that's a

1987
01:49:11.090 --> 01:49:14.990
Jocko apparently disagrees.
I know that goes a very good teacher.

1988
01:49:15.170 --> 01:49:19.550
That is a echos.
You can see as you can see him swell up a little bit,
gets that,

1989
01:49:21.350 --> 01:49:22.183
loves it.

1990
01:49:23.180 --> 01:49:26.510
A Lafe said it a impartial.

1991
01:49:27.980 --> 01:49:30.110
Listen,
that's cause I've been,
you have taught me things.

1992
01:49:30.230 --> 01:49:35.150
I imagine you have a dot.
Jocko.
Think sit in that way.
And he,
even if he would,

1993
01:49:35.210 --> 01:49:38.480
yeah,
you should,
you should go over that.
Maybe we should do that right now.

1994
01:49:39.110 --> 01:49:42.000
Kuma take down.
But look,
I,
yeah,

1995
01:49:42.010 --> 01:49:45.010
I think you can learn from a lot of different people and wheeled down one thing.

1996
01:49:45.030 --> 01:49:46.550
You just can't make sure that you can't make it.

1997
01:49:46.551 --> 01:49:48.130
You make sure it's ego getting in the way

1998
01:49:48.130 --> 01:49:50.710
<v 2>and when someone's really coaching and saying,
Hey,
you need to do this,</v>

1999
01:49:50.711 --> 01:49:53.650
you need to get better.
And you just don't like the manner in what's there.

2000
01:49:53.800 --> 01:49:55.270
They're doing it public or whatever.

2001
01:49:55.930 --> 01:49:57.880
You might need to put your ego in check and just say,
okay,

2002
01:49:57.910 --> 01:50:01.510
I don't know everything.
Of course you don't,
let's learn.
Uh,
if it's over the top,

2003
01:50:01.511 --> 01:50:04.130
then yeah,
absolutely.
You should go where you can learn,
uh,

2004
01:50:04.300 --> 01:50:07.030
best [inaudible] and the quality of the people around you that you're rolling

2005
01:50:07.031 --> 01:50:10.600
with this we talked about earlier.
I mean,
that's,
that to me is everything.
Uh,
and,

2006
01:50:10.601 --> 01:50:13.050
and that's what I love about Jujitsu is just the,
you know,

2007
01:50:13.110 --> 01:50:14.500
such a diverse group of people.

2008
01:50:14.501 --> 01:50:17.470
When you get a great gym that you're trying to edit and just folks who are

2009
01:50:17.471 --> 01:50:20.590
working together and learning together and uh,
you know,

2010
01:50:20.650 --> 01:50:21.880
they get the best of you and then they're,

2011
01:50:21.881 --> 01:50:24.220
they're willing to show you about how they did that or some things you should

2012
01:50:24.221 --> 01:50:29.030
think about it.
Keep it a secret.
But my opinion on that as well,

2013
01:50:29.350 --> 01:50:32.620
just to,
yeah,
I agree with you guys,
but at the same time I'll say this,

2014
01:50:33.280 --> 01:50:36.490
one of the things you got to learn to do in life is you got to learn that you're

2015
01:50:36.491 --> 01:50:37.660
not going to get along with everyone.

2016
01:50:37.690 --> 01:50:39.880
And not everyone's personality is going to Mesh with yours.

2017
01:50:40.150 --> 01:50:42.940
That doesn't mean you throw away the baby with the bath water.

2018
01:50:43.540 --> 01:50:46.270
You see what I'm saying?
So there might be a guy that he's not a good teacher.

2019
01:50:46.271 --> 01:50:47.440
He treats people like crap,

2020
01:50:47.590 --> 01:50:51.500
but he's got really good information and you're learning a lot and you,

2021
01:50:51.610 --> 01:50:53.950
so we're going to take as much knowledge as I can from that person.

2022
01:50:54.490 --> 01:50:57.220
I'm not just going to walk away because I don't like his attitude.
You know what?

2023
01:50:57.400 --> 01:51:00.220
You're going to have people that you work for that have bad attitudes,

2024
01:51:00.221 --> 01:51:02.710
and you're gonna have people that work for you that have bad attitudes.

2025
01:51:03.010 --> 01:51:04.450
You're going to have to learn to deal with it.

2026
01:51:04.451 --> 01:51:07.930
You're gonna have to learn how to get as much out of them as you can out of

2027
01:51:07.931 --> 01:51:10.450
everybody as a leader.
Everybody that you got there,

2028
01:51:10.540 --> 01:51:12.400
there's people that are going to be good at this,
but they're good at that.
Okay,

2029
01:51:12.401 --> 01:51:16.240
well let's,
let's capitalize on what they're good at.
So this guy,

2030
01:51:16.390 --> 01:51:18.160
very knowledgeable,
kind of a jerk.

2031
01:51:18.220 --> 01:51:20.200
Let's capitalize on the fact that he's very knowledgeable.

2032
01:51:20.260 --> 01:51:23.320
Put your ego in check and show up there.
Take the knowledge from him,

2033
01:51:24.010 --> 01:51:25.180
and then years to come.

2034
01:51:25.800 --> 01:51:30.300
<v 5>You pay him back.
Pay Him a visit.
Yeah,
I've,
ah,
I dig it.</v>

2035
01:51:30.750 --> 01:51:34.220
Sure.
And that's me.
But overall there's two.
But

2036
01:51:35.730 --> 01:51:38.100
if yes,
if you're getting the knowledge,
you're,

2037
01:51:38.220 --> 01:51:40.990
you emphasizing your life cruising.
No,
no.

2038
01:51:41.020 --> 01:51:44.170
And I emphasize in my life getting after it.
So for this,

2039
01:51:44.220 --> 01:51:46.800
therefore you're at that,
you're like,
oh,
this guy doesn't cruise hard enough.

2040
01:51:47.010 --> 01:51:50.840
Right.
We might be coming.
I want to get after it.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
No,
I dig it in.

2041
01:51:51.120 --> 01:51:54.780
But I think at the end of the day,
if,
how you said the guy,
yeah,

2042
01:51:54.781 --> 01:51:57.870
he's not saying cool stuff,
are you saying stuff that's not cool or whatever,

2043
01:51:58.170 --> 01:52:01.800
but you're still getting the information then okay.
You know,
and also just like,

2044
01:52:01.801 --> 01:52:06.060
um,
we,
Jordan Peterson and like it pays off in life to have thick skin.

2045
01:52:06.180 --> 01:52:08.250
Like you're going to be successful.

2046
01:52:08.350 --> 01:52:11.370
Like that's one of the ingredients were for success.
Like dig it.

2047
01:52:11.400 --> 01:52:12.990
So if you're giving the information for sure.

2048
01:52:13.470 --> 01:52:17.700
But a lot of times with the node all situation,
which is the words he used,
um,

2049
01:52:17.850 --> 01:52:20.310
I've been in that situation like a few times where it's like,

2050
01:52:20.760 --> 01:52:21.930
I see what you're doing there.

2051
01:52:22.020 --> 01:52:25.780
And being the guy who's kind of had some experiences,

2052
01:52:26.030 --> 01:52:27.060
I'm thinking like,

2053
01:52:27.330 --> 01:52:30.940
I don't know the circumstances that you're talking about that's not going to

2054
01:52:30.941 --> 01:52:33.930
work.
And I know that just from experience or whatever,

2055
01:52:34.140 --> 01:52:35.670
but this guy a know it all and no,
no,

2056
01:52:35.671 --> 01:52:37.830
I know you don't know kind of attitude or whatever.

2057
01:52:38.400 --> 01:52:43.020
And if that's the way the whole teaching experiences and learning,

2058
01:52:43.021 --> 01:52:45.030
quote unquote learning experiences,
I think,

2059
01:52:45.170 --> 01:52:48.380
I think more benefits would be gathered elsewhere.
Yeah.

2060
01:52:48.710 --> 01:52:51.170
It's interesting when late from you're talking about,
yeah,

2061
01:52:51.171 --> 01:52:56.171
you use your kid as a task for yourself to calm down and get more mature and

2062
01:52:58.280 --> 01:53:01.250
detach and all that.
That's good advice.
Can elastically doing that all the time.

2063
01:53:01.251 --> 01:53:04.220
Like when I,
when I meet someone that that is rubs me the wrong way.

2064
01:53:04.250 --> 01:53:05.690
I always look at that like,
okay,
cool.

2065
01:53:05.750 --> 01:53:07.080
I'm going to form a relationship with this person,

2066
01:53:07.100 --> 01:53:09.320
become their best friend and and see if I can get there.
This a big,

2067
01:53:09.321 --> 01:53:11.020
it happened so that's maybe what I do with that.

2068
01:53:11.021 --> 01:53:13.520
She just a trickle wall by wall by the way.

2069
01:53:13.521 --> 01:53:17.660
I'm taking all of his knowledge from him so I can formulate it into goodness.

2070
01:53:17.690 --> 01:53:22.280
Again,
if you getting the knowledge good men good,
but as a white belt it's like,

2071
01:53:22.580 --> 01:53:23.980
come on bro,
you to eat.

2072
01:53:24.590 --> 01:53:29.270
You want to get the best teaching learning overall Jujitsu experience possible.

2073
01:53:29.420 --> 01:53:32.720
That's where,
you know,
like as a new beginner,
white belt or whatever,

2074
01:53:32.721 --> 01:53:35.480
I'm going to come in and then just get insulted by a know it all or whatever.

2075
01:53:35.480 --> 01:53:35.991
Like I don't know,

2076
01:53:35.991 --> 01:53:39.300
even know if I like Jujitsu now kind of things are good and you run that role.

2077
01:53:39.301 --> 01:53:43.010
It's not good for business,
that's for sure.
So of course,
hey,
you're Jocko.

2078
01:53:43.100 --> 01:53:47.150
I get it man.
Life gets it.
But we're not all Jocko.

2079
01:53:47.210 --> 01:53:48.380
When someone says like,

2080
01:53:48.410 --> 01:53:51.920
or is a know it all and I'm supposed to trust this person to teach me.

2081
01:53:51.921 --> 01:53:52.490
Do you get to,

2082
01:53:52.490 --> 01:53:56.780
because you know for all the great reasons we take Jiu Jitsu and I'm trusting

2083
01:53:56.781 --> 01:53:59.810
this person and they're going to be like how this guy explained.

2084
01:53:59.870 --> 01:54:02.960
I don't know man.
I don't know.
Repeat question mark.
There you go.

2085
01:54:02.961 --> 01:54:05.510
Deep down the street and train.
That's fine.

2086
01:54:05.750 --> 01:54:10.750
I would rather get 99% of the knowledge from a good purple belt than 5% of the

2087
01:54:11.481 --> 01:54:15.760
knowledge of a know it all guy.
Okay.
There's,
there's,

2088
01:54:15.820 --> 01:54:18.800
there's clean argument for that.
Next question.

2089
01:54:20.090 --> 01:54:24.890
This is from a VJ normal Kumar.
He's been,

2090
01:54:25.160 --> 01:54:28.760
he's been on in the game for a long time.
Yeah,
I've got a lot of,
a lot of lists.

2091
01:54:28.761 --> 01:54:31.090
Do you know,
we've got a lot of listeners in India.
No,
that,
yeah.

2092
01:54:31.200 --> 01:54:34.370
Actually I taught VJ from time to time online check.

2093
01:54:34.790 --> 01:54:39.790
So he says you must have had good days and awful ones in the field.

2094
01:54:42.050 --> 01:54:46.550
How did you manage to stay focused despite the ups and downs?

2095
01:54:46.820 --> 01:54:49.130
How did you win over the darkness?
Also?

2096
01:54:49.160 --> 01:54:53.510
What was your workout like when you guys were engaged in the field and probably

2097
01:54:53.511 --> 01:54:55.160
tired?
Two questions there.

2098
01:54:56.810 --> 01:55:01.650
I think how you manage the ups and downs is,
is uh,
you got to stay focused

2099
01:55:01.650 --> 01:55:06.480
<v 3>on what the goal is.
You know,
and I think we talk about that,
how the recognition,</v>

2100
01:55:06.960 --> 01:55:07.411
you know,

2101
01:55:07.411 --> 01:55:11.160
when we came back from that deployment and you put that slide together about the

2102
01:55:11.161 --> 01:55:14.670
bowel of that kind of capture on this map,
you know,
the,
the,
uh,

2103
01:55:14.671 --> 01:55:16.260
the areas that we'd taken back.

2104
01:55:16.500 --> 01:55:21.390
And even though I had planned and lead those operations,
um,
eat,
you know,

2105
01:55:21.391 --> 01:55:22.650
so many of those operations.

2106
01:55:22.651 --> 01:55:25.550
I've been intimately involved in the planning and leading those ops and in

2107
01:55:25.551 --> 01:55:28.400
writing,
you know,
post operational summaries and all the reports that we,

2108
01:55:28.640 --> 01:55:32.970
we had and was involved in some of the battalion and brigade level meetings.
Uh,

2109
01:55:32.971 --> 01:55:35.310
you know,
for that,
that whole strategic plan.
Uh,

2110
01:55:35.311 --> 01:55:38.460
I didn't really have a fully grass,
just,

2111
01:55:38.640 --> 01:55:40.320
I didn't put it all together and that way.
And when you,

2112
01:55:40.321 --> 01:55:44.040
when I saw that slide that you put together that showed,
you know,
the,
the red

2113
01:55:44.400 --> 01:55:48.600
<v 2>enemy held areas of Ramadi and all of a sudden blue circles going in the u s</v>

2114
01:55:48.601 --> 01:55:52.920
basis,
uh,
that were put in,
that we were often the lead element on the ground for,

2115
01:55:53.300 --> 01:55:55.680
um,
it put it all together for me in a way that,

2116
01:55:55.681 --> 01:55:59.130
that I had not seen before and that I recognize I had to do better job with my

2117
01:55:59.131 --> 01:56:02.190
guys of doing that too.
And I think that's something that for every leader,

2118
01:56:02.580 --> 01:56:06.150
that's where that detachment comes in to to be able to think,
okay,

2119
01:56:06.460 --> 01:56:10.200
help me understand what this is all about through the dark times,

2120
01:56:10.201 --> 01:56:14.700
through the rough times,
so I can focus on what the strategic goal is.
Uh,
and uh,

2121
01:56:14.701 --> 01:56:18.630
and so I can help the team understand that as well.
And I think,
uh,
that's,

2122
01:56:18.660 --> 01:56:21.210
that's something that,
you know,
if you step back from the details,

2123
01:56:21.270 --> 01:56:24.300
kind of think about it so that you can understand it and then impart that team

2124
01:56:24.440 --> 01:56:26.510
that to your team so they get an understanding.
It's,

2125
01:56:26.600 --> 01:56:29.400
it enables them to slog through a,
when it's,

2126
01:56:29.401 --> 01:56:31.930
when it's really difficult and it's a,
it's dangerous or,

2127
01:56:31.940 --> 01:56:35.100
or they've got some real challenges ahead,
but they can stay focused on that,

2128
01:56:35.130 --> 01:56:36.180
that uh,
that go,

2129
01:56:37.110 --> 01:56:41.430
you also got to remember what it feels like to do the right thing for me.

2130
01:56:41.460 --> 01:56:45.060
Like I know what it feels like to not do the right thing and I don't like that

2131
01:56:45.061 --> 01:56:47.740
feeling later.
Right.

2132
01:56:47.860 --> 01:56:50.990
It feels good right now to not do the right thing because you're like,
oh,

2133
01:56:50.991 --> 01:56:54.570
cool bag of Cheetos and I'm going to get something right.
You know what,

2134
01:56:54.571 --> 01:56:57.120
that feels good right there.
We know what it feels like later.
You know,

2135
01:56:57.121 --> 01:57:01.290
you went off the path and that's not good.
So I just always think,
okay,

2136
01:57:01.291 --> 01:57:03.990
well I'm gonna,
I'm gonna suck it up now.
Take the,

2137
01:57:04.020 --> 01:57:07.020
take the problem now take the hard path now because I know later it's gonna pay

2138
01:57:07.021 --> 01:57:09.300
off.
I'm gonna feel better in the long run.
Pay Now,
pay later,

2139
01:57:09.600 --> 01:57:13.170
pay now or pay later.
That stuck with me when he said it was good.
Yeah.
Yeah.

2140
01:57:13.890 --> 01:57:16.410
I like it when you pay now and pay later.

2141
01:57:16.530 --> 01:57:21.390
Sometimes she do that take sometimes pay the man now and then pay them in late

2142
01:57:21.430 --> 01:57:24.900
and then hey asked about workouts too while we're in the field.

2143
01:57:25.020 --> 01:57:27.460
And this is a good one cause you know like firefighters,
right?

2144
01:57:27.480 --> 01:57:29.160
Firefighters are on duty for 24 hours.

2145
01:57:29.161 --> 01:57:31.170
So that means they're going to get a workout in at some,

2146
01:57:31.171 --> 01:57:34.680
sometimes they do more than that.
But the new 24 hours on,
on,
on duty,

2147
01:57:34.830 --> 01:57:39.240
where there at the station waiting for a call.
Are you going to do,

2148
01:57:41.900 --> 01:57:45.210
let's say one of the workouts from this sprinkles freedom field manual,

2149
01:57:45.211 --> 01:57:50.010
are you going to do the three sets of 20 rep squats with 20 minute rest in

2150
01:57:50.011 --> 01:57:53.970
between?
I think they call those widow maker.
Are you going to do that?
If you,
if,

2151
01:57:54.120 --> 01:57:54.390
if,

2152
01:57:54.390 --> 01:57:59.390
if within like 15 minutes you might be called on to carry a kid down a ladder,

2153
01:58:01.210 --> 01:58:04.230
don't do that workout then cause you won't be ready.

2154
01:58:04.590 --> 01:58:07.700
And that's kind of the attitude in Ramadi.
It was like,
yeah we,
we,

2155
01:58:07.701 --> 01:58:10.050
we trained hard certainly.
And it,
you know,
we talked about that on,

2156
01:58:10.060 --> 01:58:14.670
on a podcast 65 that the things they carried and,
and uh,
how we had to be,

2157
01:58:14.700 --> 01:58:15.660
we had to train hard,

2158
01:58:15.661 --> 01:58:18.890
but you had to always hold a little back because you never knew when you're

2159
01:58:18.900 --> 01:58:20.850
going to get to call.
And,
and you certainly,

2160
01:58:20.940 --> 01:58:23.350
after a big blow up squat workout like that,
I mean,

2161
01:58:23.450 --> 01:58:26.520
you weren't going to be able to run to the streets and run upstairs and drag

2162
01:58:26.521 --> 01:58:30.360
your 215 pound buddy was 60 pounds of gear on,
you know,

2163
01:58:30.361 --> 01:58:33.810
for 50 yards across the open street while shooting with the other hand.
So,

2164
01:58:33.990 --> 01:58:37.230
I mean those are the kinds of things where you gotta be ready for that.

2165
01:58:37.231 --> 01:58:42.190
And you could,
you had to leave a little reserve in the tank.
Um,
just in case,
uh,

2166
01:58:42.250 --> 01:58:44.590
because we got often we're like,
oh,
we don't have an option.
Right.
Oh,

2167
01:58:44.591 --> 01:58:49.060
we do have an opt in and get ready.
Oh,
right on.
Yeah.

2168
01:58:49.061 --> 01:58:52.360
So leave a little in the tank.
That's a good way of putting it.
Okay.

2169
01:58:52.361 --> 01:58:55.930
Here's a good one.
Next question.
This is for both of you.

2170
01:58:56.110 --> 01:59:00.670
Did either of you ever get into serious trouble as a team before joining the

2171
01:59:00.671 --> 01:59:04.630
military or will you always exceptionally disciplined from a young age?

2172
01:59:06.160 --> 01:59:11.050
Uh,
the Rafe Babbitt exceptionally disciplined from you.
The reason I'm laughing,

2173
01:59:11.051 --> 01:59:13.370
if my,
if my parents,
uh,
uh,
or,

2174
01:59:13.390 --> 01:59:16.420
or listening to this and they're probably laughing hysterically right now.
So as,

2175
01:59:16.421 --> 01:59:19.150
as our mind,
this is,
yeah,
I got an all kinds of trouble,

2176
01:59:19.240 --> 01:59:23.220
all kinds of trouble all the time.
I was a total wild man.
I,
I'm,

2177
01:59:23.290 --> 01:59:26.260
can you shoot your brother with an Arrow in the leg or something?

2178
01:59:26.810 --> 01:59:29.710
I know he stabbed himself.
Oh,
okay.
He stabs that.

2179
01:59:29.730 --> 01:59:32.440
We used to shoot each other with BB guns still in the list all the time.

2180
01:59:32.441 --> 01:59:35.460
That was,
and we threw spears and each other,
uh,
you know,

2181
01:59:35.470 --> 01:59:38.830
in high school I drove around with an old beat up pickup truck and I heard it

2182
01:59:38.831 --> 01:59:39.390
from my,

2183
01:59:39.390 --> 01:59:43.950
my uncle who had inherited from my grandfather and smash road signs and just

2184
01:59:43.990 --> 01:59:48.530
knucklehead stuff.
And,
uh,
yeah,
I was a complete idiot.
And,
um,

2185
01:59:49.000 --> 01:59:53.310
but,
uh,
you know,
in the military help score me way certainly.
And it was,
uh,

2186
01:59:53.560 --> 01:59:58.420
I'm lucky that I didn't do something that caused me to have lifelong injury or

2187
01:59:58.421 --> 02:00:00.490
death or damage.
And,

2188
02:00:00.491 --> 02:00:03.010
you know what I think or do something that you get a bunch of trouble for it for

2189
02:00:03.011 --> 02:00:05.620
sure that would have changed your jack to prevented me from going to the naval

2190
02:00:05.621 --> 02:00:08.410
cam prevented me from going in the military and,
and,
and would've,

2191
02:00:08.440 --> 02:00:13.030
that would've redrafted my,
my whole life.
So I think,
uh,
uh,
you know,

2192
02:00:13.420 --> 02:00:16.210
if you're in that stage and you're,
you're a wild teen,

2193
02:00:16.220 --> 02:00:20.590
you need to think clearly about the longterm consequences,
uh,
because,
uh,

2194
02:00:20.591 --> 02:00:24.040
you definitely can pay the man now and pay later.
And that situation,
for sure.

2195
02:00:24.100 --> 02:00:26.950
One of the things that we do is as young boys,

2196
02:00:26.951 --> 02:00:29.620
I'm speaking from a boy perspective because I'm not a girl.

2197
02:00:29.800 --> 02:00:33.010
And when I was growing up and with the way I look back on it now,

2198
02:00:33.070 --> 02:00:37.810
a lot of the stuff that we did,
dumb stuff that we did as teenagers was,
uh,

2199
02:00:37.840 --> 02:00:41.620
we were testing each other and we were trying to prove ourselves that I'm tough

2200
02:00:41.650 --> 02:00:43.840
watching me do this.
Like,
um,
it's almost,

2201
02:00:43.870 --> 02:00:47.350
it's almost like if you go instinctually as a tribe member,

2202
02:00:47.800 --> 02:00:49.660
you're proving that you're willing to sacrifice,

2203
02:00:49.661 --> 02:00:51.190
you're willing to take risk and sacrifice.

2204
02:00:51.191 --> 02:00:54.460
That's what you're proving to your peers.
Like I'm gonna like what you just said,

2205
02:00:54.461 --> 02:00:57.150
pickup truck.
I'm going to drive down the road and I'm going to,

2206
02:00:57.340 --> 02:01:00.190
I'm going to run over this sign.
Well,
okay,
it's funny,

2207
02:01:00.191 --> 02:01:02.710
but you're also proving to your friends that you don't really care.

2208
02:01:02.830 --> 02:01:05.890
I can take risk and you'll do things for the tribe.

2209
02:01:05.950 --> 02:01:09.220
That's kind of what you're proving.
So I think,
again,

2210
02:01:09.230 --> 02:01:13.300
I don't want to sound like a going back to the same broken record,

2211
02:01:13.480 --> 02:01:15.400
but if you want to get your kid,

2212
02:01:15.401 --> 02:01:17.830
or if you're a kid and you want to prove yourself,
guess what you can do?

2213
02:01:17.950 --> 02:01:20.320
You can go take Jujitsu.
You can learn how to fight for real.

2214
02:01:20.380 --> 02:01:21.500
You can learn how to defend yourself.

2215
02:01:21.540 --> 02:01:23.620
You can learn how to take care of your tribe,
take care of yourself,

2216
02:01:23.621 --> 02:01:28.210
take care of your family.
You can do,
you can learn how to beat up other people,

2217
02:01:28.330 --> 02:01:30.700
which is an important thing.
I wish I would've known it.

2218
02:01:31.540 --> 02:01:32.580
When you know what you did to you,

2219
02:01:32.581 --> 02:01:35.620
you have less of a chance of getting into a fight because the way you act is

2220
02:01:35.621 --> 02:01:39.950
different.
You don't act like a jackass cause you realize that you

2221
02:01:39.980 --> 02:01:44.030
<v 0>might get stabbed and so you act respectful to people and people can tell that</v>

2222
02:01:44.031 --> 02:01:46.190
and you're respectful back to you.
So yeah,

2223
02:01:46.191 --> 02:01:49.910
it's just another thing I think helps out a lot with kids cause I think boys are

2224
02:01:49.911 --> 02:01:53.630
always trying to prove themselves to each other and to themselves that you're

2225
02:01:53.631 --> 02:01:56.600
tough and that you're brave.
I'm trying to prove that.
You know how many,

2226
02:01:56.860 --> 02:01:58.370
let's just,
let's just survey.

2227
02:01:59.540 --> 02:02:03.050
How many times did you jump off the roof of buildings?

2228
02:02:04.520 --> 02:02:07.690
A lot.
Yeah.
It's like,
why are you doing that?
We actually used to go when I was,

2229
02:02:07.760 --> 02:02:08.810
we'd go a fishing [inaudible]

2230
02:02:08.850 --> 02:02:12.750
<v 3>the oil rigs off the coast go deep sea fishing and you might run 40 or 50 miles</v>

2231
02:02:12.751 --> 02:02:15.870
off and um,
w you're not supposed to get on the rigs.

2232
02:02:15.871 --> 02:02:16.800
There's all these signs and stuff,

2233
02:02:16.801 --> 02:02:20.520
but we totally get up on the rig and just jump off at 60 feet off the top of the

2234
02:02:20.521 --> 02:02:24.180
rig,
which was awesome.
It hurts a little bit,
but I said it was good times,

2235
02:02:24.270 --> 02:02:28.020
<v 0>but we do things to prove that we're tough.</v>

2236
02:02:28.410 --> 02:02:32.460
I did a lot of dumb things when I was a kid and most of them were to prove to

2237
02:02:32.760 --> 02:02:36.270
myself and to my friends that I was tough and then I was committed and that I

2238
02:02:36.271 --> 02:02:39.510
would take risks,
which are all that was crazier than that,

2239
02:02:39.660 --> 02:02:43.650
which are all positive qualities,
right?
That you want.
Like we were in the teams.

2240
02:02:43.720 --> 02:02:45.210
What kind of guy?
What kind of teammate do you want?

2241
02:02:45.211 --> 02:02:46.920
You want a guy that's aggressive,

2242
02:02:47.010 --> 02:02:49.290
you want a guide that will take risks if he needs to.

2243
02:02:49.620 --> 02:02:52.410
You want a guy that's committed,
that's what you want.

2244
02:02:52.530 --> 02:02:55.920
So in these little weird tribes that we have as teenagers,
that's when we have,

2245
02:02:56.100 --> 02:02:58.170
and what are you going to do to prove,
well,
let's go get a fight with somebody.

2246
02:02:58.171 --> 02:03:00.420
Let's go beat someone up.
You know,
there's all those dumb things that you do.

2247
02:03:00.750 --> 02:03:05.210
So be smart,
be smart.
Neither one of us,
uh,

2248
02:03:05.490 --> 02:03:10.260
were model children to say to say the least.
All right.
Lafe next one.

2249
02:03:10.261 --> 02:03:12.330
[inaudible] first off,
thanks for picking up the spear.

2250
02:03:12.660 --> 02:03:15.780
I'm interested to hear more about the mujahideen in Ramadi.

2251
02:03:16.080 --> 02:03:18.150
How did they stack up against US forces?

2252
02:03:18.270 --> 02:03:21.990
Was it like an NFL team playing against the high school team or did they have

2253
02:03:21.991 --> 02:03:24.390
tactics,
training and discipline equal to our own?

2254
02:03:26.970 --> 02:03:28.800
<v 3>Well,
first of all,
I appreciate the thanks,</v>

2255
02:03:28.801 --> 02:03:31.650
but it was an honor for me to carry the spear and as,
as we said,

2256
02:03:31.950 --> 02:03:35.050
we'd go back there in a heartbeat.
Certainly this is a great question.
It's,

2257
02:03:35.051 --> 02:03:36.450
it's an as a great question.

2258
02:03:36.451 --> 02:03:40.200
I think it really gets to the heart of what we talk about all the time is the

2259
02:03:40.201 --> 02:03:43.460
greatest quality in a leader in that as humility.
Um,

2260
02:03:43.500 --> 02:03:47.430
and when you look at the Mujahideen,
uh,
or the Mooc as we call them,
right?

2261
02:03:47.431 --> 02:03:51.000
The enemy fighters who control Ramadi.
There were several thousand of them by,

2262
02:03:51.180 --> 02:03:53.430
by a u s intelligence reports,
uh,

2263
02:03:53.431 --> 02:03:56.880
estimates one who controlled two thirds of the geographic area,

2264
02:03:56.881 --> 02:04:00.120
the city when we first arrived in the spring of 2006 with tasking at bruiser

2265
02:04:00.450 --> 02:04:03.910
when Jack and I were there.
And,
uh,
you know,
we were showing up our,
our,

2266
02:04:03.920 --> 02:04:06.210
our seals or some of the best shooters in the world.

2267
02:04:06.210 --> 02:04:09.270
There's some of the best combat troops in the world.

2268
02:04:09.300 --> 02:04:13.380
We have a highly screened group of guys who've been through all that,

2269
02:04:13.381 --> 02:04:16.950
the seal training pipeline.
That's a year and a half long,
probably at a minimum.

2270
02:04:17.310 --> 02:04:20.760
And then we've worked together for almost a year as a,
as a seal platoon.

2271
02:04:20.970 --> 02:04:23.910
We've got guys with extraordinary physical fitness.
Uh,

2272
02:04:23.911 --> 02:04:27.060
we'd go to these awesome shooting schools.
We trained together,
we have,

2273
02:04:27.120 --> 02:04:30.470
we have the best budget and gear,
you know,
that,
that uh,

2274
02:04:30.471 --> 02:04:34.450
all the giant special operations,
uh,
in a budget can buy a,

2275
02:04:34.470 --> 02:04:38.130
that's turning in equipment.
And,
uh,
so when we get there,
we're,
we're

2276
02:04:38.130 --> 02:04:41.180
<v 4>ready to go and pound for pound.
If you take,
you know,</v>

2277
02:04:41.190 --> 02:04:44.850
a CEO operator and from Charlotte batoon versus one of the Moose fighters that

2278
02:04:44.851 --> 02:04:49.080
were going up against that seal operator can do hundreds of pushups.

2279
02:04:49.081 --> 02:04:53.610
He can do hundreds of bullets.
NFL versus grade school.
Exactly.

2280
02:04:53.640 --> 02:04:58.500
And that the,
you know,
the,
the MOOC fighter,
he has virtually no training.

2281
02:04:58.770 --> 02:05:02.250
He could probably can't do 10 pushups.
He's,
uh,

2282
02:05:02.580 --> 02:05:06.570
he has none of the gear and awesome gear that we have.
And um,

2283
02:05:06.600 --> 02:05:09.030
and it's so it's pound for pound.
It's not even comparable.

2284
02:05:09.031 --> 02:05:13.270
And yet to think about this from,
from the reality perspective,
right in,

2285
02:05:13.280 --> 02:05:14.580
in my book,
in charter between,

2286
02:05:14.581 --> 02:05:19.020
we had 16 seals and five of those guys were brand new,
straight out of training,

2287
02:05:19.021 --> 02:05:23.040
never been,
never been in combat before,
never been,
never deployed to Iraq,

2288
02:05:23.041 --> 02:05:23.874
five of us.

2289
02:05:24.240 --> 02:05:28.710
And we're going up against the enemy that has had three years at that time,

2290
02:05:28.711 --> 02:05:33.120
three straight years of nonstop real world combat experience.

2291
02:05:33.300 --> 02:05:34.150
And so the,

2292
02:05:34.260 --> 02:05:37.620
the experience level is not even comparable when we're going up against these

2293
02:05:37.621 --> 02:05:39.960
guys.
They know the city,
they,
I mean,

2294
02:05:39.961 --> 02:05:42.450
and they're able to use our weaknesses against us.

2295
02:05:42.570 --> 02:05:46.040
Whereas we got to carry all the heavy weight and the body armor and helmets and,

2296
02:05:46.400 --> 02:05:50.850
and,
and we're not a climatized to 115 or 120 degree high,

2297
02:05:51.210 --> 02:05:54.660
uh,
during the,
during the day and the heat of the summertime.
They are,

2298
02:05:54.810 --> 02:05:57.120
and they lived there and they don't have to carry water on them and they don't

2299
02:05:57.121 --> 02:05:59.700
have to carry body armor and helmets.
And they,
they,
they,
uh,

2300
02:06:00.000 --> 02:06:02.750
they can just throw a backpack with seven RPG rockets in a,
in a,

2301
02:06:02.751 --> 02:06:06.330
in a rocket tube and rolled out with their flip flops and knock off Adidas

2302
02:06:06.331 --> 02:06:09.930
tracksuit,
which is what they generally war.
And,
uh,
and you know,

2303
02:06:09.931 --> 02:06:12.810
or their belt fed,
no Russian machine guns.
And they use,

2304
02:06:12.811 --> 02:06:14.910
they weren't near as good as the ones we had,
but they were,

2305
02:06:14.970 --> 02:06:18.530
they were deadly and they could use them and they could shoot.
And,

2306
02:06:18.531 --> 02:06:21.390
and so you can never,
ever,
ever take those guys for granted.

2307
02:06:21.420 --> 02:06:22.710
And I think that's the,

2308
02:06:23.190 --> 02:06:27.090
if they would always be looking to probe weaknesses and they weren't there to

2309
02:06:27.091 --> 02:06:30.420
fight us head to head,
they would try to take advantage of our weaknesses.

2310
02:06:30.421 --> 02:06:33.180
They were very good at analyzing a situation,

2311
02:06:33.780 --> 02:06:36.770
looking at a weakness and taking advantage of that weakness or probing for him.

2312
02:06:37.160 --> 02:06:39.780
Uh,
and if you ever took them for granted,
I mean they were,

2313
02:06:39.810 --> 02:06:41.430
they were going to there,
you were setting yourself,

2314
02:06:41.490 --> 02:06:45.300
they might hit you hard anyway and you might get lose guys,
uh,

2315
02:06:45.330 --> 02:06:46.620
even if he were prepared.

2316
02:06:46.770 --> 02:06:49.440
But if you weren't prepared and he started taking for the him for granted,

2317
02:06:49.441 --> 02:06:53.910
you sort of get complacent and a,
and not respecting them as an enemy,

2318
02:06:54.300 --> 02:06:58.260
uh,
then then you are going to fail.
And they kind of mean,

2319
02:06:58.410 --> 02:07:01.410
for lack of a better word,
they cheat too.
That's the thing,
right?

2320
02:07:01.500 --> 02:07:03.320
Looks you guys have rules of engagement for sure.

2321
02:07:03.340 --> 02:07:04.740
This stuff and they just straight up.

2322
02:07:05.010 --> 02:07:10.010
And what's I would say even more important than that is they don't have value

2323
02:07:11.610 --> 02:07:16.020
for human life.
Value their own lives.
They're,
they're literally suicide bombers.

2324
02:07:16.500 --> 02:07:20.910
And so that,
you know,
they could lose five.
They want to die,

2325
02:07:21.690 --> 02:07:26.280
they want it,
they want to achieve martyrdom in many cases.
And so,

2326
02:07:27.090 --> 02:07:32.030
you know,
them dying is,
is not a huge impact.
And then obviously for,

2327
02:07:32.060 --> 02:07:35.800
for Americans and American soldiers in our friends,
it's,
it's,

2328
02:07:36.550 --> 02:07:41.020
it's APIC and,
and crushing loss of life every single time.

2329
02:07:41.050 --> 02:07:42.960
And so that is the,

2330
02:07:43.000 --> 02:07:46.390
the biggest differences that we have to,

2331
02:07:47.350 --> 02:07:50.140
it's like being in,
it's like,
you know,
he says it,
this is what he says.

2332
02:07:50.140 --> 02:07:54.550
He says it's his NFL versus the high school team,
right?
Well,
the,
the,
the,

2333
02:07:54.580 --> 02:07:59.540
if the NFL should destroy that team,
right?
Completely destroy it.

2334
02:08:00.220 --> 02:08:04.870
But if the high school team scores a single point,
the kick a field goal,

2335
02:08:05.110 --> 02:08:08.460
they get lucky and kick a field goal,
that's it.
That's a win.
And it has,

2336
02:08:08.470 --> 02:08:11.710
that's crutch,
that's crushing.
And that's kind of what it's like.

2337
02:08:12.240 --> 02:08:14.830
They're not going to win.
They're not going to win the game.

2338
02:08:15.850 --> 02:08:19.090
But even when they put a score on the board,
man,
it,
it's crushing.

2339
02:08:19.960 --> 02:08:24.190
And one thing that I think about it too,
that what was unique about that tasking,

2340
02:08:24.191 --> 02:08:27.510
a bruiser deployment to Ramadi and 2006 was I deployed three times to Iraq.

2341
02:08:28.060 --> 02:08:31.970
A headquarter Jocko made multiple deployments.
Our rack.
We've a lot of,
you know,

2342
02:08:31.990 --> 02:08:33.610
we had a handful of guys who've been there multiple times,

2343
02:08:33.611 --> 02:08:36.300
the guys who went later Afghanistan and,
and uh,
and,

2344
02:08:36.310 --> 02:08:39.610
and elsewhere around the world and saw significant combat operations.

2345
02:08:39.610 --> 02:08:41.770
But what was unique about that was we were,

2346
02:08:41.890 --> 02:08:44.290
we were going on foot did you want to drive?

2347
02:08:44.291 --> 02:08:45.730
Cause you gonna get blown up with these,
you know,

2348
02:08:45.731 --> 02:08:49.240
horrific ids are going to destroy your vehicles.
So we park our vehicles,

2349
02:08:49.360 --> 02:08:54.100
we had to carry everything on our backs and,
and,
and walk into deep,

2350
02:08:54.190 --> 02:08:58.930
deep in enemy territory in place where we knew that it was very unlikely that

2351
02:08:58.931 --> 02:09:03.550
that tanks could even get to us to help us out in some cases.
Um,
and if they did,

2352
02:09:03.551 --> 02:09:05.680
if they were going to try to come in and they might very well get blown up and

2353
02:09:05.681 --> 02:09:08.110
kill.
So what was interesting about that is,
you know,

2354
02:09:08.111 --> 02:09:12.850
we might have eight or 10 or you know,
seal.
Sometimes it may be he was 20 seals,

2355
02:09:12.851 --> 02:09:16.480
but,
but that's a fairly small group.
You know,
we had some Iraqi soldiers with us,

2356
02:09:16.481 --> 02:09:19.930
but we didn't count them when it came to,
uh,
they didn't count when it came to a,

2357
02:09:19.940 --> 02:09:21.790
hey,
who's going to actually be able to defend this position?

2358
02:09:22.150 --> 02:09:24.760
But I had to have the expectation that,

2359
02:09:24.790 --> 02:09:28.090
that we might very well have 50,

2360
02:09:28.120 --> 02:09:32.650
60 enemy fighters surrounding our position attack us and they could easily

2361
02:09:32.651 --> 02:09:34.210
overrun us.
And what was unique about that?

2362
02:09:34.211 --> 02:09:36.760
The point was we didn't have dedicated air support.

2363
02:09:36.910 --> 02:09:40.460
We didn't have a dedicated quick reaction force that was going to come out and,

2364
02:09:40.461 --> 02:09:43.970
and help us.
That only was supporting us.
Um,
unlike,
you know,

2365
02:09:44.010 --> 02:09:45.950
some other of combat operations that are,

2366
02:09:45.970 --> 02:09:48.250
that have happened elsewhere and it was a,

2367
02:09:48.300 --> 02:09:51.880
or on other departments that I was on and we were on our own.

2368
02:09:51.881 --> 02:09:55.090
We had a plan for that and you had to recognize that they could add,

2369
02:09:55.120 --> 02:09:58.630
they would absolutely bring it and they would try to kill you,

2370
02:09:58.631 --> 02:10:01.180
overrun your position to kill everybody,
capture someone.

2371
02:10:01.181 --> 02:10:05.140
And that was a real possibility that we had to be a,
we had to recognize,

2372
02:10:05.141 --> 02:10:08.730
could happen at any time and we had to be ready for it.
Well,
just to,

2373
02:10:08.970 --> 02:10:11.530
just to stay at the statement of fact,
on top of what you're saying,

2374
02:10:11.940 --> 02:10:12.773
the enemy did.

2375
02:10:13.020 --> 02:10:18.010
The enemy did overrun friendly positions multiple times while we're there and

2376
02:10:18.011 --> 02:10:20.850
killed dozens of people in some of those,
you know,

2377
02:10:21.010 --> 02:10:25.660
some of those heavily fortified ETPs would get completely overrun attack to

2378
02:10:25.661 --> 02:10:30.100
overrun vehicle born IED.
So it,
yeah,
it wasn't like this could happen.

2379
02:10:30.700 --> 02:10:33.620
This is actually happening while we were there.

2380
02:10:34.070 --> 02:10:39.020
Friendly positions got overrun by the enemy.
And so yeah,

2381
02:10:39.050 --> 02:10:42.470
it was not just,
it could happen,
but it is happening and it's a,
it's a,

2382
02:10:43.170 --> 02:10:46.580
it could happen to us tonight,
tomorrow night,
whenever they were good,

2383
02:10:46.581 --> 02:10:50.030
they use cover move.
I mean they laid down fire support each other.
They,
they,

2384
02:10:50.330 --> 02:10:54.560
they bind together plants.
They'd combined arms,
you know,

2385
02:10:54.561 --> 02:10:56.140
they'd come in with,
uh,
the,

2386
02:10:56.260 --> 02:10:59.780
the machine gun fire and then the RPG fire and the mortar fire.

2387
02:10:59.830 --> 02:11:02.360
And then all of a sudden there'd be a VB.
That's,
that's what they do.

2388
02:11:03.290 --> 02:11:05.150
And there were different levels within there as well.
I mean,

2389
02:11:05.210 --> 02:11:08.130
sometimes you get shot at and it was kind of a spray and pray someone dumping or

2390
02:11:08.140 --> 02:11:09.170
an AK and your direction.

2391
02:11:09.410 --> 02:11:12.320
And then other times you'd have multiple belt fed machine guns hitting you that

2392
02:11:12.321 --> 02:11:14.320
were,
you know,
coming through a little,
you know,

2393
02:11:14.390 --> 02:11:18.940
three or a three by four foot window from a hundred yards away.
Uh,

2394
02:11:18.980 --> 02:11:21.770
and they're coming inches over your head and you're looking at each other like,

2395
02:11:21.771 --> 02:11:25.940
man,
these guys know what they're doing.
They,
they,
uh,
so you,
you could tell when,

2396
02:11:25.970 --> 02:11:26.803
you know,
the,
the,

2397
02:11:26.930 --> 02:11:29.720
the guys who've been there for awhile maybe come from elsewhere.
Uh,

2398
02:11:29.721 --> 02:11:32.570
they brought it and you could never take them for granted.
And also,

2399
02:11:32.571 --> 02:11:35.540
luckily for us,
even though we might not had a dedicated QRF,

2400
02:11:35.541 --> 02:11:39.420
we had the best damn Q and f in the world,
which was absolutely the One,
one a.

2401
02:11:40.130 --> 02:11:45.130
And they were awesome and never failed to come in and save any acids,

2402
02:11:45.831 --> 02:11:49.520
have tue.
They brave those roads over and over and over and over again,

2403
02:11:49.521 --> 02:11:52.670
jumping in their tanks,
taking such tremendous risk are driving it home,

2404
02:11:52.671 --> 02:11:54.620
these down,
these horribly dangerous roads.

2405
02:11:54.621 --> 02:11:57.440
We didn't want to drive to come help us out and they do that all the time.

2406
02:11:57.500 --> 02:12:00.440
They were,
they were awesome.
We couldn't have done any of our operations without,

2407
02:12:00.441 --> 02:12:02.120
without them.
Next question,

2408
02:12:03.540 --> 02:12:04.980
<v 0>and that's actually a good question.
It's,</v>

2409
02:12:04.981 --> 02:12:09.600
it's how did the Naval Academy prepare you to lead?

2410
02:12:09.601 --> 02:12:10.860
And actually a lot,

2411
02:12:10.890 --> 02:12:15.520
a lot of listeners at the naval academy and a lot of listeners at west point,
um,

2412
02:12:15.600 --> 02:12:18.450
I hear from him and actually I got sent,
that's really the helmet I got sent.

2413
02:12:18.720 --> 02:12:21.480
Somebody sent me a hand painted navy football helmet.

2414
02:12:21.740 --> 02:12:24.060
It's pretty awesome with a warship on it.
Yeah,

2415
02:12:24.280 --> 02:12:25.890
I'll show it to you this afternoon.
It's awesome.

2416
02:12:26.070 --> 02:12:30.750
Thanks for sending me that by the way.
It's awesome.
So like,
like I said,

2417
02:12:30.751 --> 02:12:33.180
a lot of listeners,
we've had Brian Stann on,
you know,

2418
02:12:33.181 --> 02:12:37.740
he talked about his experiences there and a lot of leadership he got from the

2419
02:12:37.740 --> 02:12:39.660
Naval Academy was actually from playing football.
When you listen to him,

2420
02:12:39.670 --> 02:12:43.770
he's playing football at the Naval Academy,
which was,
was a challenge for him,

2421
02:12:44.340 --> 02:12:46.230
but he learned a lot of leadership lessons there.

2422
02:12:46.320 --> 02:12:48.810
How did the Naval Academy prepare you to lead?

2423
02:12:50.740 --> 02:12:53.710
<v 4>Well,
first of all,
I love my spirits of the naval academy.</v>

2424
02:12:53.711 --> 02:12:57.870
And for me that was all about the,
the people that I serve with,
you know,

2425
02:12:57.880 --> 02:13:00.940
in the folks that I met and uh,
and the things that we went through together.

2426
02:13:00.941 --> 02:13:04.150
I've gotten a lot of trouble.
The Naval Academy,
uh,
I struggled my grades,

2427
02:13:04.151 --> 02:13:06.200
something we talked about previously.
Uh,
I got,

2428
02:13:06.201 --> 02:13:10.660
I had a big conduct record because I still did some of this knucklehead teenage

2429
02:13:10.661 --> 02:13:14.650
things and rebelled against authority.
But frankly,
uh,
you know,

2430
02:13:15.820 --> 02:13:18.040
look,
there's great people there.
You know,
there's great people on the staff.

2431
02:13:18.041 --> 02:13:18.970
I've got a very close friend,

2432
02:13:18.971 --> 02:13:22.840
there's a battalion officer now and it's awesome to have good people there that

2433
02:13:22.841 --> 02:13:26.090
are passing lessons on to,
you know,
to those young Midshipman as,

2434
02:13:26.091 --> 02:13:30.040
as a graduating and for every academy or ROTC unit know,
uh,

2435
02:13:30.370 --> 02:13:33.510
for that matter I saw,
you know,
cause you have such a wide swath of,

2436
02:13:33.511 --> 02:13:37.530
of officers from all different,
uh,
um,
you know,
from all different,
um,

2437
02:13:38.010 --> 02:13:40.740
uh,
Navy Marine Corps.
I mean every,

2438
02:13:40.830 --> 02:13:45.090
every kind of different branch of within those services as well.
And,
uh,

2439
02:13:45.091 --> 02:13:48.710
and also you have a,
an a midshipman leadership hierarchy,
right?

2440
02:13:48.730 --> 02:13:51.150
So you've got someone who,
because they made good grades are headed good.

2441
02:13:51.160 --> 02:13:54.820
Connor ever got,
got promoted into this kind of make believe position.

2442
02:13:54.830 --> 02:13:56.710
That right there.
A little bit of,

2443
02:13:56.720 --> 02:13:59.460
a little bit of anger about that one right there.

2444
02:13:59.520 --> 02:14:01.760
Just because they got good grades or they didn't have a good cognitive,

2445
02:14:01.770 --> 02:14:04.890
they really don't fit in conduct.
Record this,
they're going to charge me.

2446
02:14:04.980 --> 02:14:08.290
Listen there,
there were some resentful.
This is a new way.

2447
02:14:08.291 --> 02:14:12.420
If I just met a new life,
resentful,
I'm actually not at all resentful.
I,
I,
uh,

2448
02:14:12.540 --> 02:14:13.890
I can tell you I had some,

2449
02:14:13.950 --> 02:14:16.590
I had some good friends who were in those positions and it was great for them,

2450
02:14:16.640 --> 02:14:19.510
you know,
good for them.
Um,
it's,
it's Kinda,
it's just,

2451
02:14:19.560 --> 02:14:22.530
it's funny looking back now cause it's completely meaningless right when you're,

2452
02:14:22.531 --> 02:14:24.870
do you have a regimental commander there?
Yeah.

2453
02:14:25.160 --> 02:14:28.070
There's that guy in charge of all the students.
Yeah.
There's,
there's,
you know,

2454
02:14:28.190 --> 02:14:32.440
there's a regiment,
brigade battalion.
I had ocs.
They have it too.

2455
02:14:33.540 --> 02:14:38.470
When I was at ocs I was the man.
I was cool.
I was with a regimen redcom so,

2456
02:14:38.760 --> 02:14:40.710
so no wonder is a little sense of this.

2457
02:14:41.080 --> 02:14:45.990
He's a little red car hot and they also called it the five bar because either

2458
02:14:45.991 --> 02:14:49.020
the only person with five bars on your little uniform.
Did they,

2459
02:14:49.021 --> 02:14:52.470
did they call you captain?
Big Time though?
They cut me off President Day.

2460
02:14:52.990 --> 02:14:56.850
I was the president of my class to write a good time at ocs.
So,
so now,

2461
02:14:56.880 --> 02:15:00.090
now we see the sensitivity there.
Listen,
I,
you know,
great.

2462
02:15:00.120 --> 02:15:04.030
We maybe you should've studied harder.
I need some kids now or I hear from a guy,

2463
02:15:04.080 --> 02:15:07.260
I get correspondence from people at the naval academy and like I can see that

2464
02:15:07.261 --> 02:15:08.880
they're in the game.
I can see that.
They're like,
oh,

2465
02:15:09.140 --> 02:15:12.420
this is going on and I'm gonna,
I'm gonna like,
you know what I'm saying?

2466
02:15:12.421 --> 02:15:16.060
Like you think you could've been,
you could've had that no question about it.

2467
02:15:16.240 --> 02:15:18.510
Now would it have mattered at the time?
I don't know.
You know,

2468
02:15:18.640 --> 02:15:21.930
failure as we say is often the best teacher.
Look,
I,
I made,

2469
02:15:21.990 --> 02:15:26.250
I made great grades in high school and did well on my sats and acds without,

2470
02:15:26.990 --> 02:15:31.610
with almost no study.
Uh,
I got super,
um,
uh,
I,
I just,

2471
02:15:31.700 --> 02:15:34.000
I didn't have the discipline that was in place.
Uh,

2472
02:15:34.110 --> 02:15:35.970
once I got to the Naval Academy,
that structure that it was,

2473
02:15:36.000 --> 02:15:36.900
it was difficult for me.

2474
02:15:37.110 --> 02:15:40.050
It was very hard for me as I went into assistant engineering program and,

2475
02:15:40.320 --> 02:15:41.820
and those sort of things.
So,
so I struggle with that.

2476
02:15:41.821 --> 02:15:43.560
So that could have helped me if somebody hit,

2477
02:15:43.680 --> 02:15:45.540
if I had to learn discipline equals freedom at a,

2478
02:15:45.560 --> 02:15:49.110
at a young age and recognize the power in that I'd be way,

2479
02:15:49.200 --> 02:15:52.020
way more ahead in life and we all for sure.

2480
02:15:52.021 --> 02:15:54.840
What about playing the game and playing the game as well,
right.

2481
02:15:54.841 --> 02:15:56.610
That I'm going to buck authority of like,
you know what,

2482
02:15:56.611 --> 02:15:59.100
actually it's going to be a lot worse for you if you just,

2483
02:15:59.610 --> 02:16:01.020
even from a personal perspective,

2484
02:16:01.050 --> 02:16:03.780
not only works for you but your for your squad or for your,
you know,

2485
02:16:03.781 --> 02:16:04.890
these folks that you care about.

2486
02:16:05.080 --> 02:16:08.850
If you just build a better relationship with the folks above you instead of

2487
02:16:08.851 --> 02:16:10.140
being the the,
you know,

2488
02:16:10.141 --> 02:16:12.870
hardheaded argumentative guy for sure it would be way better for him.

2489
02:16:12.880 --> 02:16:15.780
I don't know.
When I figured that out,
I mean it was definitely,

2490
02:16:15.840 --> 02:16:17.520
it was definitely in my enlisted time.

2491
02:16:17.521 --> 02:16:21.060
I started figuring out that I'm working for a guy and I can either make my life,

2492
02:16:21.150 --> 02:16:25.740
I can either tell him he socks and then my life is going to suck out or I can

2493
02:16:25.860 --> 02:16:28.590
figure out how to work with him.
And that's going to make my life better.

2494
02:16:28.591 --> 02:16:30.730
And by the way,
it's not just gonna make my life better.

2495
02:16:30.731 --> 02:16:32.710
It's gonna make us do a better job as a team.

2496
02:16:32.950 --> 02:16:35.140
So it's interesting when you pick up on that in life.

2497
02:16:35.141 --> 02:16:39.040
And obviously if I would have been going to the Naval Academy at 18 I was a

2498
02:16:39.041 --> 02:16:42.370
knucklehead,
you know,
I would have been in the same boat of like,
oh,

2499
02:16:42.371 --> 02:16:45.120
I'm going to stick it to the man.
Right?
I mean,
I'm still listening.

2500
02:16:45.130 --> 02:16:48.340
It's tenacious d at Age,
whatever.
And we're still sticking it to the man.
Well,

2501
02:16:48.430 --> 02:16:51.200
I'll tell you the people that I realized,
like my upperclassmen,
I really like,

2502
02:16:51.201 --> 02:16:53.410
and we have some that are still serving the seal teams and,

2503
02:16:53.830 --> 02:16:56.340
and a great guy as it helped influence me.
And,

2504
02:16:56.360 --> 02:16:59.260
and I expected when I showed up there,

2505
02:17:00.340 --> 02:17:03.820
I want it to be a seal.
Yeah.
I wanted to go to war.
That's what I wanted to do.

2506
02:17:03.960 --> 02:17:04.250
And I,

2507
02:17:04.250 --> 02:17:08.470
it was very hard for me to recognize that like not everybody wanted to do that.

2508
02:17:08.471 --> 02:17:11.650
It was exactly like me or was.
So it was a,
you know,

2509
02:17:11.651 --> 02:17:13.810
that some people were a little more academic and wonder to be on the

2510
02:17:13.811 --> 02:17:15.790
intelligence side or wanting to be,
you know,

2511
02:17:15.800 --> 02:17:18.410
they wanted to drive a ship or they wanted to be on a submarine or that,

2512
02:17:18.411 --> 02:17:21.580
you know,
those things that uh,
you know,
fly a plane.

2513
02:17:21.610 --> 02:17:23.170
I mean top gun had come basket,
but you know,

2514
02:17:23.171 --> 02:17:24.640
we had a whole bunch of people that want,
wanted to be,
you know,

2515
02:17:24.641 --> 02:17:27.310
pilots that had gone to school.
So it was,
it was interesting.

2516
02:17:27.520 --> 02:17:30.410
People were a lot different than I expected and,
and uh,

2517
02:17:30.430 --> 02:17:34.390
some folks didn't quite have the,
the war lack mentality that,
uh,

2518
02:17:34.391 --> 02:17:37.180
that I expected everyone might have,
um,
you know,
going,

2519
02:17:37.181 --> 02:17:39.790
going into that environment.
But there's no question that,
uh,
I,

2520
02:17:40.240 --> 02:17:44.110
if I had done a better job of,
you know,
you call it playing,
playing the games,

2521
02:17:44.120 --> 02:17:46.480
it just seeing that,
you know,
detaching and seeing like,
hey listen,

2522
02:17:46.481 --> 02:17:48.510
thinking strategically,
thinking strategically.

2523
02:17:48.520 --> 02:17:50.410
You want to see how if we were like,
don't want to say play the game.

2524
02:17:50.411 --> 02:17:54.480
Cause that sounds too to build,
I want to build relationships.
Dbs.

2525
02:17:54.520 --> 02:17:56.070
That is not,

2526
02:17:56.110 --> 02:18:00.100
I didn't recognize that it was not in my benefit or the benefit of the people

2527
02:18:00.101 --> 02:18:03.850
around me to,
to create antagonistic relationships and that,

2528
02:18:03.851 --> 02:18:05.800
so rather than deescalate those situations,

2529
02:18:06.040 --> 02:18:08.790
I rebelled against them and pushed against them.
And,
and it,
it,

2530
02:18:08.800 --> 02:18:11.830
it was a struggle for me and it took me a long time to figure that out.

2531
02:18:12.410 --> 02:18:14.560
That that being said though,
they're there,
you know,
there's,

2532
02:18:15.700 --> 02:18:17.320
the naval calves are different than anywhere else.

2533
02:18:17.350 --> 02:18:19.990
There was great leaders there who mentored people and train people and

2534
02:18:19.991 --> 02:18:22.960
represented,
you know,
folks well that we're both officers on the staff.

2535
02:18:22.970 --> 02:18:26.740
And I listen on the staff as well as a,
you know,
as Mitchem.
And so,
uh,

2536
02:18:26.800 --> 02:18:27.850
but I think what,

2537
02:18:28.510 --> 02:18:32.110
what was the lesson for me and looking back on it now that I recognize it's

2538
02:18:32.111 --> 02:18:35.350
great to identify who you don't want to be and if someone does something that's

2539
02:18:35.590 --> 02:18:38.110
looking out for themselves or throw those people under the bus or you know,

2540
02:18:38.111 --> 02:18:40.090
those,
those leaders that you start losing respect for,

2541
02:18:40.270 --> 02:18:43.750
it's great to actually identify that.
And that's a good lesson to learn to say,

2542
02:18:43.751 --> 02:18:46.540
okay,
good.
I want to make sure I don't be that that way.
But what,

2543
02:18:46.980 --> 02:18:49.330
what I have learned is that I can't be,

2544
02:18:50.260 --> 02:18:52.570
we talked to leaders about this all the time and I get people like,

2545
02:18:52.571 --> 02:18:56.860
what do you do?
You know,
when your boss is just using a good leader,
you're like,

2546
02:18:56.890 --> 02:18:57.723
guess what?

2547
02:18:58.180 --> 02:19:01.810
The seal teams is one of the most highly screened organizations in the world.

2548
02:19:02.170 --> 02:19:03.003
What's,
uh,

2549
02:19:03.190 --> 02:19:07.990
what's the percentage of senior leaders that I worked for that I had respect
for,

2550
02:19:07.991 --> 02:19:11.920
that I'd go and work for again,
that's maybe,
maybe 20%,

2551
02:19:12.370 --> 02:19:15.160
maybe 20% of the people I worked for during my time and get,

2552
02:19:15.161 --> 02:19:17.530
that's about average.
As you talk to people,
you know,

2553
02:19:17.560 --> 02:19:20.050
it's about average in the business world is better.
It's certainly the naval cab,

2554
02:19:20.080 --> 02:19:21.070
any of those places.

2555
02:19:21.250 --> 02:19:24.820
So if you're expecting that there's most of the world out there is not going to

2556
02:19:24.821 --> 02:19:27.500
be a good leader,
they're not going to get later.
And that doesn't matter.

2557
02:19:27.520 --> 02:19:30.680
That shouldn't affect your performance.
You should be able to do,
you know,

2558
02:19:30.710 --> 02:19:31.760
something that I learned from you,

2559
02:19:31.761 --> 02:19:35.630
which has probably been the most helpful thing that you ever taught me was that

2560
02:19:35.631 --> 02:19:39.440
I should try to have the same relationship with,
with every boss.
You know,

2561
02:19:39.441 --> 02:19:42.800
whether I had deep respect for an aberration for them or whether I despise them

2562
02:19:42.801 --> 02:19:47.430
and thought they were,
you know,
Egomaniac who you know,
are a coward,
who,
you know,

2563
02:19:47.510 --> 02:19:49.840
could mitigate risks.
So,
and that it's,

2564
02:19:49.850 --> 02:19:53.150
it's in my benefit and my team's benefit to build that relationship with,

2565
02:19:53.151 --> 02:19:57.440
with my team.
And that was,
that was a lesson that I had not learned in.

2566
02:19:57.920 --> 02:20:00.910
Um,
so yeah,
those negative,
those negative lesson learns.
We're,
we're,

2567
02:20:00.911 --> 02:20:03.350
we're good for me.
Um,
and also,
uh,

2568
02:20:03.710 --> 02:20:07.070
I would have had less negative a lessons learned how to figure this out earlier

2569
02:20:07.390 --> 02:20:10.880
check,
same.
And really we got time for like one more question,

2570
02:20:11.420 --> 02:20:14.960
but it's,
it's almost the same vein.
So I think it's a good question to ask.

2571
02:20:15.260 --> 02:20:15.980
It's as life.

2572
02:20:15.980 --> 02:20:20.980
At what points did you become enlightened to extreme ownership and how did you

2573
02:20:22.551 --> 02:20:27.290
respond to the philosophy?
Kind of same vein of what you were just talking about.

2574
02:20:27.680 --> 02:20:31.070
Exactly.
I mean I,
I clearly didn't have that fully at the Naval Academy,

2575
02:20:31.100 --> 02:20:33.860
but I started to understand through the kind of school of hard knocks and

2576
02:20:33.861 --> 02:20:36.020
falling on my face and get into much of trouble and realizing like,
hey,

2577
02:20:36.320 --> 02:20:39.440
it doesn't benefit me to rebel against authority or you know,

2578
02:20:39.441 --> 02:20:43.400
not do what I'm told or be seen as,
you know,
as someone who's,
you know,

2579
02:20:43.420 --> 02:20:45.620
doesn't respect the rules or whatever.
And,
and um,

2580
02:20:46.850 --> 02:20:49.410
I think I started to learn that a little more on the surface fleet cause I,

2581
02:20:49.460 --> 02:20:51.070
my goal,
I went out surfing,

2582
02:20:51.100 --> 02:20:55.610
it was crushing to me to not be selected out of the Naval Academy and to go into

2583
02:20:55.611 --> 02:20:57.910
the seal program.
So as I went out to the,

2584
02:20:57.920 --> 02:21:00.620
and served on a couple of different surface ships,
I recognize like the,

2585
02:21:00.710 --> 02:21:04.730
what is the pathway for me to,
to the seal teams,
but my lifelong dream,

2586
02:21:04.731 --> 02:21:05.690
that's all I want to do.

2587
02:21:06.410 --> 02:21:11.180
And it was be the best freaking surface warfare officer.
Now you got to,

2588
02:21:11.181 --> 02:21:14.690
just so everyone knows now you've got to earn a recommendation to go and do
this.

2589
02:21:14.691 --> 02:21:17.870
So if you're not the best fleet officer you could possibly be,

2590
02:21:17.871 --> 02:21:18.740
someone's going to go,
why would you,

2591
02:21:18.741 --> 02:21:20.000
why would you send you the seal teams and you,

2592
02:21:20.001 --> 02:21:23.390
you're not even doing a good job here.
No.
So you've got to earn a reputation.

2593
02:21:23.420 --> 02:21:26.210
You also have to,
and a recommendation for sure you.

2594
02:21:26.420 --> 02:21:29.630
So you have to build that trust with your bosses and you have to get qualified.

2595
02:21:29.900 --> 02:21:32.660
So they've got to trust you and you have to achieve that qualification.

2596
02:21:32.660 --> 02:21:35.690
You're not even eligible until you hit your warfare qualification.

2597
02:21:36.360 --> 02:21:38.030
When you reported on board a ship,

2598
02:21:38.060 --> 02:21:41.450
you have to do certain qualifications that say,
okay,
yes,

2599
02:21:41.451 --> 02:21:45.500
you are now a surface warfare officer,
qualified surface warfare officer.

2600
02:21:45.590 --> 02:21:48.140
There's a bunch of boxes.
You've got to check those boxes,

2601
02:21:48.141 --> 02:21:52.250
or you got to learn all kinds of information about all the hundreds of different

2602
02:21:52.251 --> 02:21:54.260
systems.
And until you get that,
you're not even going to get,

2603
02:21:54.440 --> 02:21:57.290
you're not getting a recommendation that you're not even eligible.

2604
02:21:57.410 --> 02:21:59.600
You're not even eligible.
So you had to,
you had to get,

2605
02:21:59.601 --> 02:22:04.370
so I do embrace it and that helped me.
And I still had frictions certainly.

2606
02:22:04.440 --> 02:22:07.460
And,
and,
but I started recognizing like what works and what doesn't and,

2607
02:22:07.640 --> 02:22:10.490
but it wasn't really until tasking at bruiser.

2608
02:22:10.760 --> 02:22:14.690
That's where you really quantify that for me.
And,
and you know,
as,

2609
02:22:14.691 --> 02:22:15.740
as we were going through,

2610
02:22:15.741 --> 02:22:19.430
I was in my second button and so I'd already been through a previous platoon
and,

2611
02:22:19.431 --> 02:22:23.810
um,
and I,
I didn't even realize like as in that second,
the second platoon is,

2612
02:22:23.811 --> 02:22:26.970
we were working at tasking at bruiser,
which Arneb tune.
I was like,
man,

2613
02:22:26.971 --> 02:22:30.480
we're good.
We're,
we're performing well.
And when we started having,
you know,

2614
02:22:30.481 --> 02:22:33.860
a few months into the workup cycle,
we'd have,
you know,
training instructors,

2615
02:22:33.870 --> 02:22:36.180
be like,
you guys are the best tasking that we've ever seen come through here.

2616
02:22:36.750 --> 02:22:39.630
And it was interesting to me cause I was like,
well,
I don't really,

2617
02:22:39.780 --> 02:22:41.940
I mean we have some amazing guys in this task in it,

2618
02:22:42.270 --> 02:22:45.270
but I had amazing guys in my last task.
It too,
but we had very talented,

2619
02:22:45.271 --> 02:22:48.120
so it's not really the talent factor that broke us out.
You know?

2620
02:22:48.170 --> 02:22:52.890
And and I didn't even realize he certainly wasn't that we didn't make mistakes

2621
02:22:52.891 --> 02:22:55.310
cause we made all kinds of mistakes and tasking at bruiser and you know,

2622
02:22:55.520 --> 02:22:58.830
disastrous training operations where we had to come back and revamp our training

2623
02:22:58.831 --> 02:23:02.310
process and,
and make sure that we dialed in standard operating procedures.

2624
02:23:02.670 --> 02:23:07.530
Just what trainees exactly and right,
exactly.
That's the difference really.

2625
02:23:07.531 --> 02:23:11.040
Yeah.
And that was it.
It was,
it was this idea that we now call extreme ownership,

2626
02:23:11.041 --> 02:23:14.040
which is we're going to take ownership of this and instead of being like,
hey,

2627
02:23:14.250 --> 02:23:16.380
we're going to push back and gets people that are telling us we need to be

2628
02:23:16.381 --> 02:23:19.770
better or we're going to eat,
maybe even deny that we're as bad as we are,

2629
02:23:20.040 --> 02:23:23.010
we're going to take a brutally honest assessment of ourselves.

2630
02:23:23.460 --> 02:23:26.040
And that was one thing that really stands out to me as I think about it.

2631
02:23:26.610 --> 02:23:29.250
Do you remember our,
our debriefs that the training instructors,

2632
02:23:29.251 --> 02:23:32.280
they're usually have,
it's super lengthy and critical debriefs.

2633
02:23:32.700 --> 02:23:35.010
We would debrief ourselves after a run because they let the,

2634
02:23:35.011 --> 02:23:36.840
they let the tunes and the task is to go first.

2635
02:23:37.260 --> 02:23:41.190
And so often it was the only time I ever saw it to all my,
you know,

2636
02:23:41.310 --> 02:23:44.110
my nine years in the seal teams that,
uh,
that,

2637
02:23:44.120 --> 02:23:48.690
that most of the time we would get done debriefing ourselves.
And,

2638
02:23:48.830 --> 02:23:51.150
and the training instructors did not have it.

2639
02:23:51.151 --> 02:23:54.030
They had either nothing to say or maybe just a couple of sentences.

2640
02:23:54.031 --> 02:23:57.390
And that was it.
Yeah.
Cause we'd rip ourselves to shreds cause we,
we,
we were,

2641
02:23:57.450 --> 02:24:00.750
that was such a brutally honest assessment of,
and sometimes they'd be like,
Hey,

2642
02:24:00.751 --> 02:24:04.860
I actually thought you guys did pretty good.
Showed up.
We're,
yeah,
we're working.

2643
02:24:04.980 --> 02:24:08.260
And that's actually you told,
you told them,
right?
They say the worst thing,

2644
02:24:08.280 --> 02:24:12.750
you don't ever tell my guys that,
uh,
that they're,
they're doing,
they're amazing.

2645
02:24:12.751 --> 02:24:14.460
That's the best one they ever seen because that,
that,

2646
02:24:14.520 --> 02:24:17.520
that allows us to not get better,
to not grow,
to get complacent.

2647
02:24:17.850 --> 02:24:21.090
So we always did that.
And I think that's,
I s I was starting to,

2648
02:24:21.180 --> 02:24:24.630
I recognized just how powerful that was to our performance.
So again,

2649
02:24:24.631 --> 02:24:26.760
we were never flawless.
We always made,
we made mistakes,

2650
02:24:26.761 --> 02:24:29.040
but we learn from those mistakes.
We got better,

2651
02:24:29.160 --> 02:24:33.090
we grew all the time and we were able to run circles around everybody else as a

2652
02:24:33.091 --> 02:24:36.810
result and deliver some exceptional performance on the battlefields with that

2653
02:24:36.811 --> 02:24:40.180
attitude.
And that's,
you know,
that that mindset and attitude is,

2654
02:24:40.190 --> 02:24:44.090
is the game changer.
That's why we called the book extreme ownership.
Uh,

2655
02:24:44.100 --> 02:24:47.760
and it's what we impart to people as,
as we see in the business world.

2656
02:24:47.761 --> 02:24:50.580
And if there's at the end of the day just what works and there's what doesn't

2657
02:24:50.581 --> 02:24:50.850
work,

2658
02:24:50.850 --> 02:24:55.410
but that Ti tasking a bruiser and working with you and recognizing what that is

2659
02:24:55.411 --> 02:24:59.010
and how powerful that is,
uh,
that's,
that's made all the difference.

2660
02:24:59.100 --> 02:25:02.130
It's crazy to see,
and I'd see this all the time that,
well,

2661
02:25:02.310 --> 02:25:03.770
you just think about what you're saying when the,

2662
02:25:03.800 --> 02:25:06.810
when the training contrary for instance,
tells you,
Hey,

2663
02:25:07.680 --> 02:25:12.480
it took you guys a long time to get a headcount,
meaning you're on the target.

2664
02:25:12.481 --> 02:25:14.340
And you want to leave the target before you leave the target.

2665
02:25:14.341 --> 02:25:15.900
You've got to know that you've got all your people,

2666
02:25:15.901 --> 02:25:19.020
so you want to get a headcount.
So the training contrary says,
Hey,

2667
02:25:19.021 --> 02:25:21.330
it took you guys a long time to get a headcount.

2668
02:25:22.290 --> 02:25:23.920
Now you can do one of two things here.

2669
02:25:24.280 --> 02:25:27.340
<v 2>You can say,
okay,
that's because criticism.</v>

2670
02:25:27.940 --> 02:25:30.790
How could we get faster headcount?
Hey guys,

2671
02:25:30.791 --> 02:25:32.470
anyone ever done this a different way?
Yeah,
Hey,

2672
02:25:32.471 --> 02:25:35.650
I've used this process in the past.
It works really good.
Okay,
let's try that.
Oh,

2673
02:25:35.710 --> 02:25:37.720
that worked better.
And we do this one little thing.

2674
02:25:37.721 --> 02:25:40.180
It can be even a little bit faster.
Okay,
let's rehearse it.

2675
02:25:40.270 --> 02:25:43.420
Let's actually try and rehearse it.
Okay,
boom.
Now we're getting really good.
So,

2676
02:25:43.510 --> 02:25:45.700
so we take that and all of a sudden the next time we go out,

2677
02:25:45.970 --> 02:25:48.760
we do a little bit better and then we've modified a little bit more and all of a

2678
02:25:48.761 --> 02:25:52.750
sudden we can get a headcount in 15 seconds instead of four minutes.

2679
02:25:52.751 --> 02:25:54.760
Which is a huge difference when you're trying to leave a target.

2680
02:25:55.000 --> 02:25:56.590
So that's one attitude to have.
That's like,

2681
02:25:56.591 --> 02:25:59.500
we're going to take ownership of the problems.
But I would see this all the time,

2682
02:25:59.920 --> 02:26:04.740
which is,
hey guys,
your head count was a little slow and guys get up.

2683
02:26:04.870 --> 02:26:08.860
It wasn't that bad,
wasn't that bad.
And when we,
it took us four minutes,

2684
02:26:08.920 --> 02:26:13.540
four minutes is not that big of a deal
like,
or,
or like the,

2685
02:26:13.570 --> 02:26:15.010
that guy saying that right now.

2686
02:26:15.100 --> 02:26:17.830
But I'd like to see him get a head count faster than that.

2687
02:26:18.040 --> 02:26:19.630
And when we did it as fast as we could do it,

2688
02:26:19.720 --> 02:26:21.070
everyone counted as fast as we could.

2689
02:26:21.071 --> 02:26:24.280
And we made it through the first time that took us three minutes and they're

2690
02:26:24.281 --> 02:26:27.190
going to say,
that's not good enough.
A,
don't worry about that.
And so,

2691
02:26:27.191 --> 02:26:29.800
so you're going to stay on that pattern and you never get better and you're

2692
02:26:29.801 --> 02:26:32.100
never going to get better.
And it's cause you're not looking at your,

2693
02:26:32.110 --> 02:26:34.570
you're not accepting criticism from the outside.

2694
02:26:34.900 --> 02:26:38.080
And it's like when we see that with leaders now,
I started laughing,
Dave,

2695
02:26:38.260 --> 02:26:41.230
Dave and I were just working with it with,
with a team and,
and uh,
we had that.

2696
02:26:41.380 --> 02:26:42.400
It comes up all the time.

2697
02:26:42.530 --> 02:26:44.890
And it's funny when you see people pushing back against them,

2698
02:26:45.010 --> 02:26:49.870
some real constructive criticism,
and my question is always like,
oh,
okay.

2699
02:26:50.590 --> 02:26:53.800
I said,
it's just,
you know that battle of Egos there.
I look at that and say,
okay,

2700
02:26:54.220 --> 02:26:56.920
what you're telling it,
just,
just let me understand.
You're telling me that you,

2701
02:26:57.370 --> 02:27:01.540
you are at absolute optimal performance and you can never improve in any way

2702
02:27:01.590 --> 02:27:03.130
then that does that,
does that,
is that what you're saying?

2703
02:27:03.500 --> 02:27:06.730
And obviously then they ran it as like,
of course not there.
So,

2704
02:27:06.790 --> 02:27:09.820
so that kind of opens the door of,
yeah,
you can improve and you should improve.

2705
02:27:09.970 --> 02:27:13.840
And if you're not,
what you taught me is not only should you improve,

2706
02:27:14.290 --> 02:27:18.110
I think the big lesson that I learned from you and that we now teach here with

2707
02:27:18.160 --> 02:27:21.700
echelon front is,
is that if not only should you improve,

2708
02:27:21.910 --> 02:27:23.830
but if you're not trying to do better,

2709
02:27:23.831 --> 02:27:27.040
if you're not doing everything you can to have the most efficient and effective

2710
02:27:27.100 --> 02:27:31.780
headcount that you can and improve in every aspect of your game,
all the time,

2711
02:27:32.140 --> 02:27:35.140
that you're actually failing you as a leader and you're failing your team.

2712
02:27:35.140 --> 02:27:38.500
And I think that's a very fundamental difference of looking at it,
that it's,

2713
02:27:38.510 --> 02:27:41.590
it's not just know I should be doing that,
but no,
if I'm not doing that,

2714
02:27:41.620 --> 02:27:44.950
I'm a failure as a leader and I'm failing my team.
Yeah.
And all of this is weird,

2715
02:27:44.980 --> 02:27:47.830
you know,
talking about this headcount thing,
it's,
it's a great example.

2716
02:27:47.860 --> 02:27:49.720
I'm surprised I haven't talked about it very much because it's a,

2717
02:27:49.721 --> 02:27:52.960
it's a really big deal like for,
and when you leave at target,

2718
02:27:52.961 --> 02:27:55.480
you can't leave until you know that you have all your guys,

2719
02:27:55.780 --> 02:27:56.740
so you've got to get a head count.

2720
02:27:56.741 --> 02:28:01.270
There's multiple different ways to get a head count and the easiest ways you use

2721
02:28:01.271 --> 02:28:03.790
decentralized command in every little team leader counts there,

2722
02:28:03.791 --> 02:28:05.020
three or four guys and they go,
Yep,

2723
02:28:05.140 --> 02:28:09.310
one's up to is up threes up and they report in up one level and by the time I

2724
02:28:09.311 --> 02:28:11.090
would need a head count I'd look at life and,

2725
02:28:11.150 --> 02:28:13.090
and the Delta platoon commander and I'd be like,
Hey,
are we up?

2726
02:28:13.300 --> 02:28:16.600
And it would take them 10 seconds and like we're up the,
the way,

2727
02:28:16.660 --> 02:28:21.040
the worst way to do it,
which I would also see would be,
you would literally

2728
02:28:22.490 --> 02:28:27.050
<v 0>from,
from the lowest guy,
there's 36 guys in the troop and someone would say,</v>

2729
02:28:27.051 --> 02:28:31.740
hey head count.
And the back guy would go 36 35 and they,

2730
02:28:31.820 --> 02:28:36.820
you'd have assigned numbers 35343330230 was 31 oh over here.

2731
02:28:42.670 --> 02:28:46.930
Wait,
you're 31 no I'm 32 W did you count?
And so you need,

2732
02:28:47.000 --> 02:28:50.210
it takes three minutes,
four minutes.
And,
and yet it's like,

2733
02:28:50.270 --> 02:28:53.660
well that that's a very sensible way on paper to do it.

2734
02:28:53.690 --> 02:28:56.510
Cause you know you're going to have all your people but in reality doesn't work.

2735
02:28:56.900 --> 02:28:59.330
And that's that one.
And so this is that one little thing,
right?

2736
02:28:59.331 --> 02:29:02.200
This one little thing,
one little improvement you can make,
but,

2737
02:29:02.270 --> 02:29:04.220
but that's not the only improvement you can make.

2738
02:29:04.280 --> 02:29:08.360
You can improve every little thing that you do and every little thing that you

2739
02:29:08.361 --> 02:29:11.000
do as a team,
everything that you do as an individual human being,

2740
02:29:11.001 --> 02:29:14.450
you can make it just a little bit better.
And the minute that year you're,

2741
02:29:14.451 --> 02:29:16.220
you're seeing back new year your phone,
you know what,

2742
02:29:16.250 --> 02:29:19.230
I'm not going to make this change anymore.
Um,
I'm,

2743
02:29:19.400 --> 02:29:22.580
I've reached my pinnacle of performance in this category.

2744
02:29:22.790 --> 02:29:24.080
The minute that you're do that,

2745
02:29:24.170 --> 02:29:27.380
it's not just one category that you're slacking off on.
It's all of them.

2746
02:29:27.890 --> 02:29:29.330
And I was telling you guys the other day,
I'm like,

2747
02:29:29.570 --> 02:29:33.820
you know when you see me post a picture in the morning that is saying we've got,

2748
02:29:33.830 --> 02:29:36.440
I'm getting up,
but I'm mocking it before 30 if it does,

2749
02:29:36.441 --> 02:29:39.770
it says the four 35 that means I got up at four 30 and I got out of bed and I

2750
02:29:39.771 --> 02:29:41.530
went in and,
and,
and,

2751
02:29:41.560 --> 02:29:46.010
and I took a picture of my watch and I post it when I'm posting it at four oh

2752
02:29:46.011 --> 02:29:50.570
eight that means I woke up and I was like,
I got to get busy is I,

2753
02:29:50.630 --> 02:29:53.130
it's not all,
it's not alarm clock.
I'm gotta get,
I gotta go do,

2754
02:29:53.131 --> 02:29:54.320
I've got to go make these things happen.

2755
02:29:54.620 --> 02:29:58.960
I gotta look and see where I can improve my method for getting a headcount.

2756
02:29:58.970 --> 02:30:01.280
How can I make it that much faster?
That one little thing.

2757
02:30:01.281 --> 02:30:04.700
And when you look at your array of what's your going on in your business and

2758
02:30:04.701 --> 02:30:06.980
it's also in your life,
do,
what can you do a little bit better?

2759
02:30:08.060 --> 02:30:12.020
You attack those problems.
You accept the criticism when it comes at you,

2760
02:30:12.021 --> 02:30:15.520
which is so hard for everyone to do,
myself included.
You accept the Chris,

2761
02:30:15.521 --> 02:30:16.520
he listened to it,

2762
02:30:17.000 --> 02:30:21.740
and then you modify and you make these little iterative changes and at the end,

2763
02:30:21.890 --> 02:30:26.540
instead of being a decent task unit or instead of being a decent person or

2764
02:30:26.541 --> 02:30:29.570
instead of running a decent team,
you can be the best.

2765
02:30:30.710 --> 02:30:35.710
And that's only happens if you take ownership of what's going on in your world

2766
02:30:40.160 --> 02:30:44.120
with that
Echo Charles.
Yes.

2767
02:30:45.170 --> 02:30:49.090
Speaking of taking ownership,
trying to get better.
Yes.

2768
02:30:49.160 --> 02:30:51.410
Maybe you could help us out with that a little bit.
I don't know.
Yeah,

2769
02:30:51.411 --> 02:30:52.820
that's possible.
That's interesting though.

2770
02:30:52.821 --> 02:30:56.900
Like where when you put it into perspective,
right?
The extreme ownership,

2771
02:30:56.901 --> 02:30:59.390
because you know how you say the biggest or one of the,
the biggest,

2772
02:30:59.391 --> 02:31:02.150
best qualities of a leader is humility.
Humility.
Yeah.

2773
02:31:02.280 --> 02:31:07.130
You see the tie in right now,
right?
More so.
Yes.
Because you figure,

2774
02:31:07.140 --> 02:31:10.920
okay,
so you said a little bit of a stripe stripe on the,

2775
02:31:11.360 --> 02:31:15.920
on the leadership white belts.
There you go.
So you get a team,

2776
02:31:16.150 --> 02:31:20.280
a team of people,
all different,
you know,
personalities,
whatever.

2777
02:31:20.310 --> 02:31:23.610
<v 2>Eagles,
different varying levels,
right?
So for little,</v>

2778
02:31:23.820 --> 02:31:26.940
there's going to be all these little problems.
No one's perfect,
no one's optimal,

2779
02:31:27.180 --> 02:31:30.840
right?
That's kind of the goal.
Even if it's unattainable perfection,
right?

2780
02:31:30.841 --> 02:31:32.070
That's the kind of the gold optimal.

2781
02:31:32.460 --> 02:31:37.440
Then you have a team with however many mistakes they make and then as they
train,

2782
02:31:37.441 --> 02:31:41.250
perform all this stuff,
all the little mistakes get pointed out.

2783
02:31:41.580 --> 02:31:45.930
And it's almost like this self,
uh,
self correcting organism.

2784
02:31:46.020 --> 02:31:48.540
We hope it is.
That's why,
yes,
you hope it is.

2785
02:31:48.541 --> 02:31:50.970
So like if you compare it to like a machine learning situation,

2786
02:31:50.971 --> 02:31:53.640
it does that cause it doesn't have ego,
it doesn't take things personal.

2787
02:31:53.641 --> 02:31:55.890
It's kind of like,
let me just solve all the little problems.

2788
02:31:55.891 --> 02:31:59.610
And then that's why they can grow and exponential rates.
Right.

2789
02:31:59.910 --> 02:32:02.710
The thing that's awesome about that though is that you get w w attic,

2790
02:32:02.880 --> 02:32:05.010
what you're talking about is building the culture,
right?
So you get,

2791
02:32:05.011 --> 02:32:07.470
if the leaders doing that and you get to team doing it once,

2792
02:32:07.590 --> 02:32:10.850
once people recognize like,
hey look how much better we are.
Head counts.

2793
02:32:11.160 --> 02:32:15.090
Even if our existed that then you start getting junior leadership who knew,

2794
02:32:15.170 --> 02:32:18.510
you know,
frontline troops,
new guys who,
you know,
they come up with an idea,
hey,

2795
02:32:18.511 --> 02:32:22.170
here's a way we can do this a little better.
Solving problems you don't even see.

2796
02:32:22.320 --> 02:32:24.760
Yeah.
It's a so saying that the other day,
you know,
I was,

2797
02:32:26.340 --> 02:32:31.260
I was at in a training situation the other day and I saw things go bad for this

2798
02:32:31.261 --> 02:32:35.260
group.
It was a military group and,
and things are going bad.
They weren't,

2799
02:32:35.340 --> 02:32:38.010
they all dropped the ball.
They all kind of drop the ball.

2800
02:32:38.011 --> 02:32:42.450
But there's slack there,
there were slack.
True.
And I was thinking to myself,

2801
02:32:42.900 --> 02:32:45.750
I wouldn't see,
uh,
a young but new guy,

2802
02:32:45.751 --> 02:32:48.390
machine gunner not get in a good position.

2803
02:32:48.450 --> 02:32:52.470
I would never see that with my eyes because the guy that was immediately senior

2804
02:32:52.471 --> 02:32:56.610
to him would,
would straighten them out.
There would be no slack right there.

2805
02:32:56.670 --> 02:32:58.200
There'd be no soccer.
Like he gets straight out.

2806
02:32:58.350 --> 02:33:02.610
So by the time I show up and I look around,
everyone's doing amazingly well.

2807
02:33:03.290 --> 02:33:07.050
Everything's the way it should be.
It's not quite optimal,
but it's damn close.

2808
02:33:07.650 --> 02:33:09.860
And why is that?
It's because what you just said life.

2809
02:33:09.861 --> 02:33:13.670
If it's because every leader,
every individual leader and every person is,

2810
02:33:13.830 --> 02:33:17.040
is adjusting and making things,
making adjustments that I'm not even seeing.

2811
02:33:17.640 --> 02:33:19.560
And why are they doing that?
Number one,

2812
02:33:19.590 --> 02:33:21.810
because they're all humble enough to look that they need to change things.

2813
02:33:21.811 --> 02:33:25.140
And number two,
everyone in the group has their ego in check.

2814
02:33:25.141 --> 02:33:28.830
So when someone says,
Hey,
shift,
you're fueled the fire a little bit to the West,

2815
02:33:29.070 --> 02:33:33.300
the guy doesn't say why.
Yeah,
no,
he goes,
I wonder why.
Oh I see.

2816
02:33:33.301 --> 02:33:35.460
Cause he's got another guy over there that's covering that feel.
If I got it,

2817
02:33:35.580 --> 02:33:39.030
got it.
Boss.
You know that's,
that's what,
that's it.
Now we have like,

2818
02:33:39.031 --> 02:33:41.400
like a machine that just improving all the time.
Yeah.

2819
02:33:41.550 --> 02:33:45.330
Which is what we're going for.
And if you lack humility in any,

2820
02:33:45.420 --> 02:33:48.740
in any one of those levels,
you're,
you're,
you're going to slow down that machine.

2821
02:33:48.741 --> 02:33:51.360
It's progress,
that process fully.
Duh.
Yeah.

2822
02:33:51.361 --> 02:33:53.790
So it's weird when you look at it from the big picture,
you know,

2823
02:33:53.940 --> 02:33:54.773
and you see like,

2824
02:33:54.930 --> 02:33:58.380
just like how you're saying when you kind of mentally compared your current team

2825
02:33:58.381 --> 02:34:01.260
with teams in the past like Oh,
there was talented guys on the other side,

2826
02:34:01.320 --> 02:34:03.210
on the other teams that I was on too.

2827
02:34:04.170 --> 02:34:09.170
But you kind of understand and recognize that one factor is that everyone's kind

2828
02:34:09.421 --> 02:34:13.800
of humbling is always constantly like,
what can I do better right here with my,

2829
02:34:14.380 --> 02:34:18.280
you know,
situation in my own little world here.
But everyone's

2830
02:34:18.280 --> 02:34:19.970
<v 5>doing that.
So it's like this,
if you,</v>

2831
02:34:20.020 --> 02:34:23.890
if you kind of collectively consider this group,
they're just humble,
boom,
self,

2832
02:34:23.891 --> 02:34:26.980
self entertaining,
one step forward.
Just,
just once that further,

2833
02:34:26.981 --> 02:34:29.830
just so everyone can think about how to implement this in your world,

2834
02:34:30.520 --> 02:34:34.660
the way you implement it isn't by saying,
guys,

2835
02:34:35.650 --> 02:34:40.120
the headcount will slow.
You need to fix it.
It's not by saying,
hey,

2836
02:34:40.121 --> 02:34:43.510
the approach to the target was too loud.
You need to be quiet.

2837
02:34:44.440 --> 02:34:47.200
That's not how you fix the problem.
You say,
hey guys,

2838
02:34:49.030 --> 02:34:52.690
our headcount is taking too long.
I need to come up with a better way to do it.

2839
02:34:53.200 --> 02:34:55.660
I need to,
I need,
I need to figure this out.
Or Hey guys,

2840
02:34:55.661 --> 02:34:57.520
we were too noisy going to the target.

2841
02:34:58.000 --> 02:35:00.070
I need to make sure that you have the gear that you need to,

2842
02:35:00.071 --> 02:35:03.240
and I need to make sure we all understand how important it is to be quiet going

2843
02:35:03.250 --> 02:35:07.320
to the target.
I think I was too loud,
right?

2844
02:35:07.360 --> 02:35:08.290
I think I was too loud.

2845
02:35:08.440 --> 02:35:11.440
Now everyone says Pam giagles like he's blaming himself for being too loud,

2846
02:35:11.441 --> 02:35:13.930
but I'm the one that was over the back there.
My drop my canteen.

2847
02:35:13.931 --> 02:35:15.850
It made a bunch of noise in the rocks.
That was my fault.

2848
02:35:16.540 --> 02:35:20.470
I'm going to tighten myself up.
Yeah,
as opposed to blaming everyone,

2849
02:35:20.471 --> 02:35:23.350
and we talk about this all the time.
The minute you're blaming everyone,

2850
02:35:23.351 --> 02:35:25.840
everyone's just,
you know,
they're looking for excuse,
they're blaming you.

2851
02:35:25.841 --> 02:35:28.180
You don't understand how hard it is to carry that canteen quietly.

2852
02:35:28.181 --> 02:35:30.730
And I was thirsty cause I've been carrying them machine gun and I needed to get

2853
02:35:30.731 --> 02:35:32.200
water right there.
I was going to get dehydrated.

2854
02:35:32.201 --> 02:35:36.700
They're just making excuses and the machine can't self correct and machine kid

2855
02:35:36.710 --> 02:35:41.590
self can't do it just stays in the one inefficient ineffective mode.

2856
02:35:42.670 --> 02:35:47.620
Speaking of machines,
machines need oil.
Hmm.
Not Necessarily Krill oil,

2857
02:35:47.621 --> 02:35:51.140
but we need krill oil.
B Plus a fee.

2858
02:35:52.400 --> 02:35:55.510
No,
already jumping to Jacqueline's supplements.
Good News.

2859
02:35:56.200 --> 02:35:58.060
I just took my Jocko Krill oil.

2860
02:35:58.120 --> 02:36:01.420
This small room gets so let me to always everyday.
Don't forget,

2861
02:36:02.230 --> 02:36:03.160
can't slack on that.

2862
02:36:03.190 --> 02:36:07.240
Thanks for bringing me some Krill oil in New York too by the way.
Yeah,

2863
02:36:07.310 --> 02:36:10.930
that you still owe me a bottle for them.
Yeah,
no problem.
I know a guy,

2864
02:36:11.470 --> 02:36:14.530
his name is Jocko and the Krill oil is called Jocko,

2865
02:36:14.560 --> 02:36:19.060
Super Krill and joint warfare by the way,
which is another joint supplement,

2866
02:36:19.420 --> 02:36:23.930
you know,
maintain the physical capabilities of your body.
Um,

2867
02:36:24.040 --> 02:36:28.150
I said don't forget to take it and don't run out by the way.

2868
02:36:28.750 --> 02:36:30.910
I ran out before.
But if you are running out,

2869
02:36:30.911 --> 02:36:35.770
there is a subscription option by real robust by request.
Yeah.
You get it.

2870
02:36:35.770 --> 02:36:38.500
Let every month you can get it every month,
every two weeks.
This,

2871
02:36:38.940 --> 02:36:43.940
well this was cool though because the indicator was when people order Krill

2872
02:36:45.520 --> 02:36:49.210
during warfare,
guess what they do?
They order more.
Yeah.

2873
02:36:49.420 --> 02:36:51.520
And then they order more so than the requests were.

2874
02:36:51.640 --> 02:36:54.640
Can we just put it on subscription?
So there,
uh,
I mean I don't,

2875
02:36:54.641 --> 02:36:57.280
I just take three of them,
three of each,
boom.

2876
02:36:57.400 --> 02:37:01.030
But I had never read like how much should I be taking this a little bit more

2877
02:37:01.031 --> 02:37:03.700
like strong like this.
I'll tell you what I take.

2878
02:37:03.760 --> 02:37:08.760
I take three of each in the morning and I take three at night.

2879
02:37:10.470 --> 02:37:13.300
I know that's good and that's fine.

2880
02:37:13.301 --> 02:37:17.540
But what is the recommended you're talking to the guy that orders the 40 ounce

2881
02:37:17.541 --> 02:37:21.870
steak to be good.
More is better after a 48 hour recommended,

2882
02:37:22.290 --> 02:37:25.670
I would say.
I would say depending on your way,
but I'd say like two and two.

2883
02:37:25.700 --> 02:37:29.050
Take two of each in the morning,
two of each at night.
And also you can,

2884
02:37:29.660 --> 02:37:33.170
you can also do this.
You can also,
you know,
see where you're at.
Right.

2885
02:37:33.710 --> 02:37:36.330
Like you know what it feels like when you haven't been taking your like yeah.

2886
02:37:36.410 --> 02:37:39.290
So then up the dose.
That's what I did and I've been real,

2887
02:37:39.530 --> 02:37:42.830
real confident with where I'm at.
Yeah.
I mean two,
three and three for me.

2888
02:37:42.831 --> 02:37:46.280
Not twice one one time,
three and three.
Boom.
Morning.

2889
02:37:46.550 --> 02:37:48.350
I got to get a lot of subscription though.
That's good.

2890
02:37:48.351 --> 02:37:51.470
I like that option cause I run out and uh,

2891
02:37:51.810 --> 02:37:54.260
and then and then it takes days to,
yeah,
it,

2892
02:37:55.400 --> 02:37:58.880
that's what sucks is it takes like three days,
right?
Three days you're like,

2893
02:37:58.910 --> 02:37:59.600
oh my,

2894
02:37:59.600 --> 02:38:03.680
oh I haven't been taking it and then you got to get back on it and it takes

2895
02:38:03.681 --> 02:38:08.360
another couple of days.
It's wack subscription if you're into it.

2896
02:38:08.730 --> 02:38:13.400
We're like,
can you get that anyways all like that.
Well this is more stuff.

2897
02:38:13.401 --> 02:38:15.590
What?
Yeah.
Yeah.
If you want to go get it right now,

2898
02:38:15.591 --> 02:38:17.480
origin main.com that's where you get it.

2899
02:38:17.570 --> 02:38:21.920
also@originmean.com also Jocko supplement,
it's called discipline.

2900
02:38:22.280 --> 02:38:26.330
It's a pre admission cognitive enhancers,

2901
02:38:26.360 --> 02:38:31.010
micro dose of caffeine.
If you're into it,
just like Jocko white tea,

2902
02:38:31.950 --> 02:38:36.860
you're all,
I just wanted the bottle just sampled.
So tasty.
Yeah.
See Tasty,

2903
02:38:36.920 --> 02:38:41.660
which is,
I mean maybe,
yeah.
I mean again,
I know I said it before,

2904
02:38:41.661 --> 02:38:42.520
but it,

2905
02:38:42.550 --> 02:38:46.190
it doesn't seem like you're all like focused on taste because you're not focused

2906
02:38:46.191 --> 02:38:50.180
on looks.
No,
not at all.
Yeah.
But you liked the taste

2907
02:38:51.890 --> 02:38:56.030
and make sure it's the stuff tastes good apparently.
But uh,
it is good stuff.

2908
02:38:57.170 --> 02:39:01.040
I take that one every day too.
When do you take it?
Morning now?

2909
02:39:01.370 --> 02:39:05.420
Pre,
pre day life free day Manulife.
You know why?

2910
02:39:05.421 --> 02:39:09.410
The way I see it is like there's no caffeine or there's not like huge amounts of

2911
02:39:09.411 --> 02:39:11.120
caffeine.
So it's like,
okay,

2912
02:39:11.121 --> 02:39:14.870
if I'm going to microdose I ripped that off from Tim Ferriss.

2913
02:39:15.320 --> 02:39:20.320
Microdosing microdosing LSD and microdosing cycle drugs and whatever sounds

2914
02:39:22.251 --> 02:39:25.730
cool.
That's not really my thing,
but I'll take a little micro dose of caffeine,

2915
02:39:26.120 --> 02:39:31.010
15 milligrams.
Sure.
But give you a little glimpse into the spirit world.

2916
02:39:32.690 --> 02:39:37.160
I don't think you'd do it well.
The LSD might.
Yes,
for sure.
Oh

2917
02:39:39.630 --> 02:39:41.630
yes.
Let me get some of that sometime.

2918
02:39:41.990 --> 02:39:45.350
I just figured that like the cognitive enhancing,

2919
02:39:45.351 --> 02:39:47.390
enhancing nutrients.

2920
02:39:47.450 --> 02:39:51.790
I figured that's like a thing that's not like a drug.
Right?
It's nutrients.

2921
02:39:51.800 --> 02:39:56.000
So that's he's taking every day.
So your brain is just generally more capable.

2922
02:39:56.990 --> 02:39:58.250
It's just what I figured.

2923
02:39:58.251 --> 02:40:00.150
Maybe that's why he's answering all of these good questions.

2924
02:40:00.150 --> 02:40:04.310
So they got the discipline and maybe the neurons are firing.
I've been on it.

2925
02:40:05.060 --> 02:40:09.780
That's why I got those stripes.
19% increase in performance.
Thanks for and,

2926
02:40:09.870 --> 02:40:13.070
and the rest her to do that by the way also anyway.
Um,

2927
02:40:13.230 --> 02:40:18.230
get them@originmain.com also@originmain.com is where you get your key straight

2928
02:40:20.131 --> 02:40:24.720
up.
You have origin g I do have an orange.
Again,
they're,
they're awesome.

2929
02:40:24.960 --> 02:40:28.290
I had comments on all the time.
They're uh,
there,
Greg [inaudible].
They're,

2930
02:40:28.291 --> 02:40:31.650
they're super lightweight but they're super strong and,
and uh,
yeah,

2931
02:40:31.680 --> 02:40:32.640
definitely my favorite game.

2932
02:40:33.070 --> 02:40:36.420
I'm looking to get another one mind too and made it in America by the way.

2933
02:40:36.450 --> 02:40:38.490
Brian emailed me yesterday.

2934
02:40:38.560 --> 02:40:42.210
You might think that's the best thing about origin geese that it made in
America,

2935
02:40:42.240 --> 02:40:45.030
but then it's not because he'd get the gate and you realize that.
Yeah,

2936
02:40:45.120 --> 02:40:46.140
it's awesome.
Yeah,

2937
02:40:46.141 --> 02:40:50.640
because if it was made in America and then you're like [inaudible] the other

2938
02:40:50.641 --> 02:40:54.320
night I was rolling in the deaf.
Yeah.

2939
02:40:56.410 --> 02:41:00.660
The interesting thing,
we obviously we don't,
I'm not a fashion guy.
Right?
Well,

2940
02:41:00.690 --> 02:41:05.210
I mean clearly I'm not a fashion life can tell you want to see your stories.

2941
02:41:05.220 --> 02:41:10.220
You can tell like to tell stories about my fashion escapades from 1987 tapered

2942
02:41:10.260 --> 02:41:14.430
jeans.
Danner,
Danner,
combat boots.
Right.
That's how I roll.

2943
02:41:14.700 --> 02:41:19.470
But when you put it on the deaf guy that everyone says something,
why is that?

2944
02:41:19.471 --> 02:41:21.720
It's just cause it looks because it's not flashy.

2945
02:41:22.360 --> 02:41:27.270
It just says discipline equals freedom and then it says get after every time I

2946
02:41:27.271 --> 02:41:30.180
walked by people when I'd walk by,
then I'd hear him going to get after it.

2947
02:41:31.650 --> 02:41:33.600
And you know what Pete is like that though.

2948
02:41:34.080 --> 02:41:37.200
What has like an element of fashion in his stuff?
No,
I know.

2949
02:41:37.201 --> 02:41:38.310
I got to put them in check on that.

2950
02:41:38.800 --> 02:41:40.650
I had to go back and forth a little bit of like,
Hey,

2951
02:41:40.860 --> 02:41:43.660
you got to put that in check.
You want to,
cause he made some,

2952
02:41:45.330 --> 02:41:48.630
he made some spats.
Oh yes.
Which is an approved term now.

2953
02:41:49.230 --> 02:41:53.280
Wave compression pants.
Compression pits.
Tights is what?

2954
02:41:53.281 --> 02:41:56.730
Super Superman and call them Spanish.
But anyways,
he made some of that work.

2955
02:41:56.790 --> 02:42:01.650
Is that like jeggings?
No Jake,
way too far.
Their genes,
but they're late.

2956
02:42:01.651 --> 02:42:06.270
It's,
I know this because my daughter has some chick to teenage girls.

2957
02:42:06.271 --> 02:42:10.750
You don't know what jeggings arc about?
They're like legging slash jeans.

2958
02:42:12.050 --> 02:42:13.120
Well yeah.

2959
02:42:13.620 --> 02:42:16.860
Pete has more fashion sense cause he's got that whole design thing going on.

2960
02:42:16.910 --> 02:42:19.710
Yeah.
Like he's a designer.
He's a creative.

2961
02:42:19.740 --> 02:42:23.280
I know you listed in your all designing stuff up there.
Me,

2962
02:42:23.281 --> 02:42:24.450
I'm like make it black.

2963
02:42:25.280 --> 02:42:28.440
What can we add to it more black and what kind of shape do you want in the

2964
02:42:28.441 --> 02:42:31.590
waistline or it just like,
I,
I don't know about that kind of stuff with pizza.

2965
02:42:31.780 --> 02:42:34.890
Don't worry.
I got it.
And that's why until he designed the,

2966
02:42:35.100 --> 02:42:38.040
the multicolored spats.
Whoa.

2967
02:42:38.220 --> 02:42:42.090
That's just like just taking it again or I can't even,
I can't even,
I'm not even,

2968
02:42:42.320 --> 02:42:46.110
I have to put myself in check here because I realized that that is beyond my

2969
02:42:46.111 --> 02:42:49.890
domain of competency right there.
That is way beyond my domain of competency.

2970
02:42:49.980 --> 02:42:53.060
So if you want to get those spots,
go for it.

2971
02:42:53.490 --> 02:42:58.190
But to Pete's credit,
guess what they have now black black spots.

2972
02:42:58.680 --> 02:43:02.820
If you need them you can get them.
Boom.
But even here,
even the other gies though,

2973
02:43:02.821 --> 02:43:07.200
people before I got the deaf one,
people would be like,
oh that's a nice geek.

2974
02:43:07.310 --> 02:43:09.960
What's really interesting is when you see that we've,
yeah,

2975
02:43:09.961 --> 02:43:13.220
we've is what makes it gorilla.
Yeah.

2976
02:43:13.360 --> 02:43:17.080
But there's like this little pattern in the raven actually the first one of the

2977
02:43:17.081 --> 02:43:19.230
first ones I actually held was years life cause you've,

2978
02:43:19.231 --> 02:43:20.890
you've got an origin GE for a long time.

2979
02:43:20.900 --> 02:43:24.150
Yeah because you asked me a long time ago before I was even with origin,

2980
02:43:24.160 --> 02:43:26.630
you're like,
hey what kind of gift shops don't get a damn origin game.

2981
02:43:27.220 --> 02:43:30.940
Awesome coming.
You would tell me about it and you went and got one.

2982
02:43:30.941 --> 02:43:33.670
I went and bought one.
It was good and I was like,
God damn,
this thing is nice.

2983
02:43:33.700 --> 02:43:38.050
But yeah,
there's a pattern.
All right,
cool.
We get it.
Sorry,
I'm just saying crazy.

2984
02:43:38.160 --> 02:43:39.520
He don't care about the fashion of people.

2985
02:43:39.521 --> 02:43:43.210
Sneak it in there just for like fashion.
I got to watch out for Pete.

2986
02:43:43.390 --> 02:43:47.350

3006
02:44:53.560 --> 02:44:57.490
Can you buy a driving lot more?
Cause when I think lawnmower,
I think drew Amazon,

3007
02:44:57.491 --> 02:45:00.640
you probably can probably here like this.

3008

3011
02:45:10.750 --> 02:45:13.860

No.
No.

3012
02:45:13.870 --> 02:45:16.600
You've got to go somewhere else to show that is a damn shit.

3013
02:45:16.630 --> 02:45:19.680
One of my buddies was asking me that the day he was going to go shooting and,

3014
02:45:19.710 --> 02:45:23.710
and he's uh,
he's a British guy and his name is English.

3015
02:45:23.711 --> 02:45:28.711
Peta and sure and English pizza don't hold that guys shoot and they call them

3016
02:45:29.390 --> 02:45:34.030
English as his nickname,
English Peta,
p.
E t,
a.
H,
English,

3017
02:45:34.031 --> 02:45:38.170
Peta.
I think this pizza was going to go shooting with someone and he says,
Hey,

3018
02:45:38.171 --> 02:45:40.210
you know,
want to go?
He says,
Hey,
I'm going to go shoot tinker.

3019
02:45:40.270 --> 02:45:42.880
Would you like to come?
And maybe we could work on some covered move.

3020
02:45:44.060 --> 02:45:46.480
And I was like,
I was like,
I was like,
I can't make it.

3021
02:45:46.540 --> 02:45:50.170
And then I saw him later and I said,
oh,
how was the shooting?
He says,
oh,

3022
02:45:50.180 --> 02:45:54.550
we didn't get to go mate,
or does it go,
couldn't go,
couldn't go.
And I said,
oh,

3023
02:45:54.551 --> 02:45:56.560
that's a bummer.
I said,
you're going to like it.
He goes,

3024
02:45:56.660 --> 02:46:00.760
I really want to shoot is like the RPG.
And I was like,

3025
02:46:01.030 --> 02:46:04.120
that's going to be a little tricky.
Check Amazon.

3026
02:46:07.070 --> 02:46:11.600
Yeah,
Amazon.
I don't think they provide that kind of stuff,
but if they do,
hey,

3027
02:46:11.630 --> 02:46:14.270
whatever.
You know when you buy your book by one of those,
cool.

3028

There's a bunch of other podcast apps and I don't even know what their names
are.

3032
02:46:30.201 --> 02:46:32.420
I need to start tweeting the,

3033
02:46:32.960 --> 02:46:36.230
the locations of those have got to figure them all out.
Yeah.
Well,

3034
02:46:36.530 --> 02:46:39.410
and there's a bunch.
Yeah,
and they're coming out with new ones.
It's like this,

3035
02:46:39.680 --> 02:46:44.120
you'd think we,
well,
we kind of said before you'd think,
oh,
iTunes.
Right.

3036
02:46:44.121 --> 02:46:47.040
That's what podcasts are.
But the podcast is a podcast and hey,

3037
02:46:47.050 --> 02:46:47.841
what's interesting,

3038
02:46:47.841 --> 02:46:51.080
and I haven't seen this factually or I don't know where that number came from.

3039
02:46:51.290 --> 02:46:55.520
So like two years ago,
18% of America was listening to podcasts.

3040
02:46:55.580 --> 02:46:58.520
1818 like when we started,
that's the number I got.

3041
02:46:58.550 --> 02:47:01.550
I was like researching all how many people are listened to her right now?

3042
02:47:01.580 --> 02:47:05.180
So it's been two years.
48% of Americans listen to podcasts.

3043
02:47:05.181 --> 02:47:06.830
And that right there is explosive growth.

3044
02:47:06.880 --> 02:47:10.550
It's pretty amazing because it's a great medium.
Yeah.
Yeah.

3045
02:47:10.551 --> 02:47:13.520
It's like kind of like having a commerce,
well,
I guess it depends on the podcast,

3046
02:47:13.521 --> 02:47:16.670
but yeah,
I agree fully.
Please subscribe if you want.

3051
02:47:32.601 --> 02:47:36.170
Mostly I'm just saying we see more people watching the episodes with,

3052
02:47:36.260 --> 02:47:39.850
with guests.
I want to see what they look like.
A parody.
Yeah.

3053
02:47:40.040 --> 02:47:42.110
Unless if you're interested in that and excerpts.

3054
02:47:42.111 --> 02:47:44.240
If you don't want to necessarily watch the whole podcast,

3055
02:47:44.241 --> 02:47:46.400

Also enhanced excerpts.
That's what we're calling them now.

3058
02:47:53.870 --> 02:47:56.450
Some of that too.
Anyway,
various video types on there.

3059
02:47:57.470 --> 02:48:00.080
I've seen you've been a little bit more your spear throwing more punches now

3060
02:48:00.730 --> 02:48:04.640
let's go a little bit more.
Yeah,
more.
Yeah,
we're going to keep that going,

3061
02:48:04.670 --> 02:48:07.920
so yeah,
there'll be more clips to choose from.
You know,

3062
02:48:07.940 --> 02:48:10.530
you don't listen or watch or whatever.
Yeah,
so he has subscribed.

3063
02:48:10.550 --> 02:48:14.030
Good way to support.
Also,
Jack was a store.

3064
02:48:14.300 --> 02:48:16.850
It was called Jocko store.
Of course.

3065
02:48:16.910 --> 02:48:21.770
[inaudible] dot com that's where you can get discipline equals freedom shirts,

3066
02:48:23.120 --> 02:48:24.340
victory MMA shirts.

3067
02:48:24.341 --> 02:48:28.490
Someone Jocko wears every day while we do the podcast and otherwise,

3068
02:48:29.240 --> 02:48:32.390
and you don't get out anyway.
This shirts on this podcast,
shirts,

3069
02:48:32.420 --> 02:48:36.800
Jocko gear shirts also rash guards,
also hoodies,

3070
02:48:36.801 --> 02:48:40.160
also hats.
Did you mention a new shirt?
Is there a new shirt?

3071
02:48:40.190 --> 02:48:44.190
I mentioned new shirt cause it out cause I haven't approved or seen anything.
No,

3072
02:48:44.830 --> 02:48:49.300
it's good.
It's good.
Authorize.
Yeah.
Yeah,
it's in limbo right now,
but I,
I'm very,

3073
02:48:49.520 --> 02:48:53.810
we're confident.
It's like the patches.
He secretly wants you to do it.
Yeah.
Yeah.

3074
02:48:53.900 --> 02:48:55.130
Now this one he's going to openly,

3075
02:48:55.880 --> 02:49:00.880
I think you'll approve cause there there's no colored shirts yet approved and

3076
02:49:00.951 --> 02:49:04.670
then you know,
actually it's called back to the book.
Oh no surprise.

3077
02:49:04.910 --> 02:49:06.950
We talked about it before but I,

3078
02:49:07.110 --> 02:49:09.630
it's coming along with a few layers on there and I'm,
you know,

3079
02:49:09.960 --> 02:49:12.670
I'm going to go ahead and offer it,
offer it up.com.

3080
02:49:12.690 --> 02:49:15.810
Can't release it until there's enough layers.
Yes,
no.
Yeah.
Layer lists,

3081
02:49:15.811 --> 02:49:17.310
shirts or unapproved.
Who has the most,

3082
02:49:18.140 --> 02:49:21.900
the shirt that I designed is the most layered shirt.
Is that correct?
Yes.

3083
02:49:21.901 --> 02:49:24.000
I think that's good.

3084
02:49:24.510 --> 02:49:27.990
You said you submitted quite easily there.
It's true.
The truth.

3085
02:49:27.991 --> 02:49:31.080
You have the woody call it the gift of truth or what it was it,

3086
02:49:31.680 --> 02:49:34.260
I don't know when they're like,
hey,
what if the,

3087
02:49:34.390 --> 02:49:38.280
our competition is gossiping about us?
You have the big weapon,

3088
02:49:38.670 --> 02:49:40.890
the weapon or the truth.
The high ground.
Yeah.

3089
02:49:40.891 --> 02:49:44.250
So you've got numbers on your site nonetheless.
Chocolate store.com.

3090
02:49:44.251 --> 02:49:47.820
That's where you can get all the cool stuff.
Check it out.
If you want something,

3091
02:49:48.120 --> 02:49:51.570
get something.
Also,
psychological warfare,
if you didn't know what that is,

3092
02:49:51.571 --> 02:49:54.870
it's an album with tracks,
Jocko tracks.

3093
02:49:56.490 --> 02:50:00.240
When you run into those moments of weakness in your campaign against weakness,

3094
02:50:01.130 --> 02:50:04.160
<v 3>speaking of which,
uh,
so I'm getting my car,
you know,</v>

3095
02:50:04.161 --> 02:50:08.240
I've got thousands of songs on my iTunes.
Yeah,
I get,
I get in my car,

3096
02:50:08.330 --> 02:50:10.820
you know how to it.
I have my Bluetooth on and he realize it,

3097
02:50:10.821 --> 02:50:15.620
but it just automatically syncs up to my trucks.
I jump on my truck and,
and the,

3098
02:50:15.690 --> 02:50:19.280
I didn't realize the radio was kind of a high volume.
Apparently.

3099
02:50:19.580 --> 02:50:21.580
I think my kids would be screaming in the backseat.

3100
02:50:21.590 --> 02:50:24.140
So I'll play like some kid kiddos,
but I get in there,

3101
02:50:25.640 --> 02:50:30.110
I get in there and uh,
and all of a sudden it's like Jockos voice.
I mean,

3102
02:50:30.200 --> 02:50:33.550
I get it,
I'm not paying attention,
backing up and it's like,
it's Kinda weird.

3103
02:50:34.010 --> 02:50:35.830
Does Discipline Cope?

3104
02:50:37.220 --> 02:50:41.240
And of all the random,
you know,
thousands of songs that I have on my iTunes,

3105
02:50:41.241 --> 02:50:42.770
like that comes up.
I was like,
what are the odds?

3106
02:50:42.771 --> 02:50:47.270
And it was actually something I needed to hear at that moment,
uh,
and,
and to,

3107
02:50:47.340 --> 02:50:48.980
to remind me to give back all the bath.

3108
02:50:48.981 --> 02:50:53.140
So that is something that's extremely helpful.
Perfect.
Um,
and uh,
the,

3109
02:50:54.300 --> 02:50:58.220
the universe universal line,
diverse Charles for that,

3110
02:50:58.270 --> 02:51:02.030
and it may cause Echo Charles originally said to me like,
Hey,

3111
02:51:02.031 --> 02:51:05.300
what do you do here?
And I answered him some question.
It was a,
it was like,

3112
02:51:06.240 --> 02:51:07.430
he's like,
well,
how do you not skip

3113
02:51:07.470 --> 02:51:10.230
<v 5>workouts?
And I was like,
I bumped up,
up,
up,
up.
He's like,
Bro,</v>

3114
02:51:11.130 --> 02:51:14.670
we need to record that and put it out so people can listen to it.
And he's like,

3115
02:51:14.690 --> 02:51:16.420
and you should answer the rest of them.
You should be like,
what?

3116
02:51:16.710 --> 02:51:19.020
How'd you get out of bed?
And drives us.
All right.
Ask me the questions.

3117
02:51:19.290 --> 02:51:22.390
And that's where it came from.
Echo Charles.
Yeah.
A little additional thing.

3118
02:51:23.010 --> 02:51:25.570
You know how the cane,
I don't know if you've run into this where you're,

3119
02:51:25.630 --> 02:51:28.200
you're like,
shit,
I have Outta,
I'm confused,

3120
02:51:28.201 --> 02:51:29.740
or I don't have the answer for this thing.
So I'm going to,

3121
02:51:29.790 --> 02:51:32.460
I'm going to ask Jocko what is just,
what is he think?
Right?

3122
02:51:32.461 --> 02:51:36.130
As you're asking them,
you're like,
oh,
I know what he's gonna say or it.
Right?

3123
02:51:36.570 --> 02:51:38.310
So this one,
he was like,
oh.
I was like,
oh,

3124
02:51:38.311 --> 02:51:39.690
I know what this guy's going to say right now.

3125
02:51:39.690 --> 02:51:42.120
He's just going to stop being weak or something,
something like that.

3126
02:51:42.450 --> 02:51:46.140
So it was more like,
I get it.
Stop being weak.
Okay.

3127
02:51:46.230 --> 02:51:49.590
But there was a little bit more to that,
like,
what do you say?

3128
02:51:49.591 --> 02:51:52.770
Like what do you think?
Or whatever,
you know,
something like,
all right,
yeah,

3129
02:51:52.800 --> 02:51:56.760
we're going to record that.
And these chocolate trucks,
they have it for anything,

3130
02:51:56.761 --> 02:52:00.720
not just skipping workouts for procrastination,
getting up early,
all this stuff.

3131
02:52:00.721 --> 02:52:03.990
So it's kind of like,
even if your volumes not turned up,

3132
02:52:04.020 --> 02:52:06.100
it's kind of like Jocko is actually telling you like

3133
02:52:06.100 --> 02:52:10.710
<v 2>hottest,
not skip the workout.
It's good.
It's encouragement.
Yeah.</v>

3134
02:52:10.810 --> 02:52:13.480
Yeah.
I would say what's funny is happening,
people are always like,

3135
02:52:13.510 --> 02:52:17.860
oh you should make a thing of you yelling at me to get out of bed.
Yeah.
I,

3136
02:52:17.970 --> 02:52:20.650
you know,
I thing that would work,

3137
02:52:21.040 --> 02:52:25.130
but it would only work like a few times after a while it's kind of like,
oh yeah,

3138
02:52:26.080 --> 02:52:29.210
cool.
Shut him according of Jocko yelling.
But if you,

3139
02:52:29.211 --> 02:52:31.060
you know how like you're talking like you know,

3140
02:52:31.061 --> 02:52:34.860
so like it's kind of like you're explaining,
you know,
like this is this,

3141
02:52:34.870 --> 02:52:36.490
what's going on,
this which good kind of thing.
It's,

3142
02:52:36.500 --> 02:52:41.470
it's enough of a reminder of that.
Kay,
get back on the path.
There you go.

3143
02:52:41.820 --> 02:52:45.130
But yeah.
Good one.
Get down one on iTunes.

3144
02:52:45.430 --> 02:52:48.640
It basically anywhere where they sell in.
Yeah.
It's available.

3145
02:52:48.700 --> 02:52:49.580
Psychological warfare.

3146
02:52:49.770 --> 02:52:54.770
We support the also when you're on Amazon you can get Jocko white tea.

3147
02:52:54.850 --> 02:52:57.520
Now the good thing about there's some good things and bad things about Jocko

3148
02:52:57.521 --> 02:53:01.540
white tea,
the bad things or is you got to mix it up with hot water.

3149
02:53:01.541 --> 02:53:02.740
That can take a little extra time.

3150
02:53:02.920 --> 02:53:07.920
The good things is once you drink about a half a cup of white tea,

3151
02:53:08.060 --> 02:53:09.250
and this is what we're finding now,

3152
02:53:09.430 --> 02:53:11.110
when you drank about a half a cup of white tea,

3153
02:53:11.111 --> 02:53:13.780
you are then able to deadlift 8,000 pounds.

3154
02:53:13.930 --> 02:53:17.590
A lot of people are wondering how much you had to drink and the answer is you

3155
02:53:17.591 --> 02:53:22.210
can drink a half a cup and you're there so you can get Jocko white team and it's

3156
02:53:22.211 --> 02:53:26.950
also legal in which a lot of people are trying to get it out loud right now by

3157
02:53:27.400 --> 02:53:29.320
the athletic commission and the Olympics.

3158
02:53:29.321 --> 02:53:32.290
They don't want people on the records and everything,
so yeah,

3159
02:53:32.291 --> 02:53:36.280
they're trying to just ban it but get it while you can get it while you can,

3160
02:53:36.281 --> 02:53:40.030
before it gets bad,
before it gets banned and then you're just done.

3161
02:53:40.360 --> 02:53:44.140
Also some books,
the books that I read on the podcast for sure.

3162
02:53:44.440 --> 02:53:47.870
There's also a book called a lot of the books I read in the podcast or are for

3163
02:53:47.890 --> 02:53:51.430
adults,
clearly a lot of more very,
you need a mature audience,

3164
02:53:51.790 --> 02:53:55.690
but kids also need to know how to get on the path.
And my right,
you've got kids,

3165
02:53:55.691 --> 02:53:57.640
you got kids.
Kids need to know how to get on the path.

3166
02:53:57.940 --> 02:54:01.060
How are they gonna get on a path?
Well,
number one,

3167
02:54:01.061 --> 02:54:05.350
they can get the book way of the Warrior Kid and they can get on the path with

3168
02:54:05.351 --> 02:54:07.840
that.
And now there's another book coming out.

3169
02:54:07.900 --> 02:54:12.580
It's way the warrior kid to sequel,

3170
02:54:12.670 --> 02:54:16.030
the sequel.
Cool.
Could it be,
but jaws to fail.

3171
02:54:17.620 --> 02:54:22.240
There's always that chance.
If I would've listened to my publisher.

3172
02:54:23.620 --> 02:54:27.850
Yeah,
cause the,
what do they want to do?
They want you to churn out,
hey,

3173
02:54:27.851 --> 02:54:31.360
you've got a little bit going here.
Let me get another one that's ride the wave.

3174
02:54:31.450 --> 02:54:35.170
Right.
And by the way,
let us help you shape,
you know,
where we think we,

3175
02:54:35.171 --> 02:54:38.410
this could go.
Oh,
so you just want to take it down that path to no,

3176
02:54:38.411 --> 02:54:41.290
we're not going down that path.
Life's hard.

3177
02:54:41.830 --> 02:54:45.700
Mark's gonna face some more struggles and he does.

3178
02:54:46.990 --> 02:54:49.030
Luckily he's got an uncle Jake comes and help him out.

3179
02:54:49.360 --> 02:54:52.660
Weigh the word kid marks mission.
You can preorder it right now.

3180
02:54:52.690 --> 02:54:57.160
It comes out April 24th is the date that it comes out.

3181
02:54:57.520 --> 02:54:58.810
You can get that.
Also,

3182
02:54:59.830 --> 02:55:02.080
if you're an adult and you want to get on the path to stay on the path,

3183
02:55:02.081 --> 02:55:04.190
be on the path,
move down

3184
02:55:04.190 --> 02:55:08.450
<v 4>the path.
You can get a book called Discipline Equals Freedom Field Manual,</v>

3185
02:55:09.680 --> 02:55:13.100
which echoes apparently knows all about field manuals.
My favorite kind of man,

3186
02:55:13.110 --> 02:55:17.030
you have a favorite kind of manuals.
This is going to help you stay on the path.

3187
02:55:17.060 --> 02:55:18.020
That's what it's gonna do.

3188
02:55:18.890 --> 02:55:22.250
Not only what you should think about in a section called thoughts,

3189
02:55:22.251 --> 02:55:27.251
but also the actions you should take if you want to proceed to get stronger,

3190
02:55:28.610 --> 02:55:33.490
faster,
smarter and all around better.
And if you want the audio version,

3191
02:55:33.560 --> 02:55:36.140
don't look for it on audible cause it's not there.

3192
02:55:36.950 --> 02:55:41.950
This is an album also with tracks and it's available in MP three format from

3193
02:55:44.811 --> 02:55:49.700
Amazon music from Google,
play from other MP three platforms

3194
02:55:51.950 --> 02:55:56.630
and actually life.
Talk a little bit about,
I dunno,
a couple books.

3195
02:55:56.631 --> 02:56:00.170
We wrote a little company,
we got maybe a little event that we're doing.

3196
02:56:00.740 --> 02:56:01.521
First and foremost,

3197
02:56:01.521 --> 02:56:05.000
if you want to dive deeper and the leadership principles that we've been talking

3198
02:56:05.001 --> 02:56:09.290
about and referencing get extreme ownership.
That's we have people ask us like,

3199
02:56:09.291 --> 02:56:11.030
Hey,
what did you make mistakes in your career?

3200
02:56:11.120 --> 02:56:13.070
We wrote a whole book about him and that's when he screamed.
Oh,

3201
02:56:13.071 --> 02:56:15.350
she was about the mistakes we learned on the battlefield,

3202
02:56:15.590 --> 02:56:18.130
the things that happened to us,
what we learned from them.
Um,

3203
02:56:18.210 --> 02:56:21.140
and then how that principle applies a business in life.

3204
02:56:21.141 --> 02:56:24.620
So go get that book on Amazon or anywhere that you can buy books.

3205
02:56:24.621 --> 02:56:27.140
And if you're like me and you're super busy and you don't have a lot of time to

3206
02:56:27.141 --> 02:56:31.880
read,
um,
then,
uh,
you can get the audible book now,
the audio book,
it's on audible,

3207
02:56:31.881 --> 02:56:35.150
it's on anywhere,
uh,
and uh,
and get,
uh,
get that version.

3208
02:56:35.180 --> 02:56:38.810
And we read it by the way we read it,
the James Earl Jones wasn't available.

3209
02:56:39.300 --> 02:56:42.980
So parents is Batman was we,
we,
uh,
we had to read it.

3210
02:56:43.220 --> 02:56:46.040
I didn't realize it was the Texas Batman until people are listening to this
book.

3211
02:56:46.250 --> 02:56:49.670
Yeah.
That's where that was born on social media.

3212
02:56:49.850 --> 02:56:52.900
I hear good things about the audio version though.
There's,

3213
02:56:53.450 --> 02:56:56.600
there's little surprises in the audio version that it wants.
Again,

3214
02:56:56.601 --> 02:56:58.700
we didn't listen to our publisher.
Our publisher was like,

3215
02:56:58.701 --> 02:57:01.460
well that's kind of weird to put that.
Well we,
well,
what do you,

3216
02:57:01.461 --> 02:57:04.780
would you rather hear for gunfire?
Uh,
you know,

3217
02:57:04.790 --> 02:57:07.700
me going or would you rather hear gunfire?

3218
02:57:07.760 --> 02:57:10.850
What would you rather hear for an explosion?
Lafe going,
Kaboom.

3219
02:57:11.270 --> 02:57:12.470
Or would you rather have an explosion?

3220
02:57:13.010 --> 02:57:16.310
What would you rather have for the call to prayer life?

3221
02:57:16.311 --> 02:57:18.310
Talking about the call to prayer coming?
Cause it's,

3222
02:57:18.380 --> 02:57:22.460
it can be pretty eerie in those situations.
Or would you rather actually hear it?

3223
02:57:22.940 --> 02:57:27.410
So there's,
what would you call that?
Uh,
audio theater.
Sure.

3224
02:57:27.830 --> 02:57:31.030
You make it into call it that.
Okay.

3225
02:57:31.630 --> 02:57:34.490
And they did a great job with that,
with the audio book.
So get that,

3226
02:57:34.491 --> 02:57:36.380
that's certainly an option as well.
Uh,

3227
02:57:37.010 --> 02:57:41.780
and if you have a company or you want to work,
work with us,
uh,
echelon front,

3228
02:57:41.870 --> 02:57:43.550
that's our,
that's our company that's not in front of you.

3229
02:57:43.551 --> 02:57:45.320
And if you're looking to,
uh,

3230
02:57:45.350 --> 02:57:50.030
to implement these leadership programs into your team,
learn from us,
learn,

3231
02:57:50.060 --> 02:57:52.800
learn those same principles that we talk about.
Um,

3232
02:57:52.910 --> 02:57:55.490
then that's what we do and Islam front is we,

3237
02:58:06.271 --> 02:58:10.110
and win on your battlefield.
And that's just that,
that what echelon front is,

3238
02:58:10.111 --> 02:58:13.200
is our company is Jocko,

3240
02:58:16.781 --> 02:58:20.370
and a whole team of folks is Jocko talks about the tank where we talk about

3241
02:58:20.371 --> 02:58:23.610
these leadership problems,
we solve those problems and,

3242
02:58:23.640 --> 02:58:26.460
and we help you lead and win.
And that's awesome.
We love that.

3243
02:58:26.490 --> 02:58:29.160
So if you're interested in and working with us,

3244
02:58:29.400 --> 02:58:32.910
go to a echelon front.com and of course the muster,
which you talked about,

3245
02:58:32.940 --> 02:58:36.180
this is the ultimate leadership conference.
Uh,
and an F.

3246
02:58:36.210 --> 02:58:37.410
We've got four of these so far.

3247
02:58:37.440 --> 02:58:40.500
Every single one of them have sold out every single one of sold out.

3248
02:58:40.501 --> 02:58:43.500
So don't wait if you were interested in common,
uh,

3249
02:58:43.550 --> 02:58:45.450
we're only doing two this year.
We're only doing two.

3250
02:58:45.480 --> 02:58:49.550
We had a lot going on for us and we said we're going to do two amazing monsters.

3251
02:58:49.800 --> 02:58:51.780
A,
that's what we're going to focus on.
We did three last year,

3252
02:58:51.781 --> 02:58:54.630
but we're only doing two this year and that's in Washington DC,

3253
02:58:54.780 --> 02:58:59.130
May 17th and 18th and that's in San Francisco October 17th and 18th.

3254
02:58:59.670 --> 02:59:01.040
And that's it.
If you want to,
uh,

3255
02:59:01.200 --> 02:59:02.670
if you want to come and be a part of the monster,

3256
02:59:02.680 --> 02:59:06.060
go to extreme ownership.com and get registered and we'll see you there.

3257
02:59:07.260 --> 02:59:08.460
<v 0>And until the muster,</v>

3258
02:59:08.490 --> 02:59:13.490
if you want to kind of continue this conversation that we're having right now,

3259
02:59:13.681 --> 02:59:16.950
you can find us continually conversing.

3260
02:59:17.890 --> 02:59:21.210
As far the Inter webs on Twitter,

3261
02:59:22.350 --> 02:59:23.780
on Instagram,
me

3262
02:59:25.430 --> 02:59:28.490
<v 3>and on that face he ball</v>

3263
02:59:30.770 --> 02:59:32.680
Lafe is that Leif Babin

3264
02:59:32.960 --> 02:59:37.310
<v 0>go is at Echo Charles and I am at Jockowillink Echo Charles.
Anything else?</v>

3265
02:59:38.390 --> 02:59:41.480
No self correcting machine.

3266
02:59:42.350 --> 02:59:45.170
That's what happens when you start doing the extreme ownership thing.

3267
02:59:45.680 --> 02:59:48.890
Does the added layer I gathered from today?
Legit.
I like it.

3268
02:59:48.891 --> 02:59:53.070
Thanks for [inaudible] clarify.
Oh it was good to see you.
Nice forever.

3269
02:59:53.150 --> 02:59:58.070
Maybe not always,
but if any closing thoughts.
Good to be on.
Again,

3270
02:59:58.280 --> 02:59:59.600
we're looking forward to the next time.

3271
02:59:59.870 --> 03:00:03.230
I suppose we'll do one more of when we're up the muster we'll talk more.

3272
03:00:03.260 --> 03:00:07.180
They will talk more about,
probably talk a little bit about extreme ownership.

3273
03:00:07.190 --> 03:00:08.780
Maybe we'll talk a little bit more about the new book,

3274
03:00:09.320 --> 03:00:12.950
which will be done for the most part by then.
Awesome.

3275
03:00:13.010 --> 03:00:16.160
Obviously thanks for coming on.
Thanks to everyone out there,

3276
03:00:16.161 --> 03:00:21.161
especially those of you who are out there in uniform who have basically said,

3277
03:00:25.280 --> 03:00:30.280
I am willing to give everything I have for freedom or we're here today because

3278
03:00:30.381 --> 03:00:31.730
of you.
So thank you.

3279
03:00:31.731 --> 03:00:35.660
Thank you to the police and the law enforcement and the firefighters and the

3280
03:00:35.661 --> 03:00:40.661
paramedics and the rest of the first responders that do their job every day,

3281
03:00:43.710 --> 03:00:48.710
every day to make sure that we are safe here at home and everyone else out there

3282
03:00:49.971 --> 03:00:53.690
that's listening and sharing and supporting this podcast.

3283
03:00:55.040 --> 03:00:58.850
Thank you.
But don't just,

3284
03:01:00.520 --> 03:01:05.170
and don't just support and don't just share,

3285
03:01:06.880 --> 03:01:11.530
but instead
wake up every day with a mission.

3286
03:01:13.320 --> 03:01:18.320
Wake up everyday with a goal to be a little bit better than you were yesterday

3287
03:01:19.890 --> 03:01:24.090
and become the self correcting machine

3288
03:01:26.520 --> 03:01:28.260
that's not going to bring you to perfection,

3289
03:01:29.280 --> 03:01:34.280
but it's going to bring you to a place that's a little bit closer to get out

3290
03:01:35.041 --> 03:01:39.330
there and get after it.
And until next time,

3291
03:01:39.600 --> 03:01:42.330
this is Lafe and echo and Jocko

3292
03:01:43.590 --> 03:01:43.930
<v 1>out.</v>
