00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:05.700
This is Jocko podcast number one 37 with Echo Charles and me,

2
00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:09.160
Jocko Willink.
Good Evening Echo and good evening.

3
00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.460
If you know the way broadly,

4
00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:17.730
you will see it in all things

5
00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:24.910
and that is a simplified quote from Musashi's book of five rings and it's a

6
00:00:25.861 --> 00:00:30.810
solid quote.
Make sense?
I'd,
I believe it to be true,

7
00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:33.690
but at the same time,

8
00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.200
while I agree with Musashi that if you know the way broadly,

9
00:00:37.201 --> 00:00:38.370
you'll see it in all things.

10
00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:43.790
There's a little bit of a problem with that concept and the problem is how do

11
00:00:43.891 --> 00:00:47.100
you get to know the way broadly?

12
00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:51.630
I mean the way is no easy thing to grasp.

13
00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:54.570
You weren't born with it.

14
00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:58.850
You don't just wake up with it.

15
00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:05.530
It's something that you have to learn and it's something that you are always

16
00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:06.800
still learning,

17
00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:13.400
but even though you have to learn the way at the same time,

18
00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:18.670
learning the way is hard because of the way is something that's hard to teach.

19
00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.290
Then recently I've been asked a couple by a couple different people in a couple

20
00:01:25.291 --> 00:01:27.920
of different scenarios how I learned what I learned,

21
00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.270
how have I learned what I learned and this is believe me,

22
00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:38.190
no claim that I know what ton of stuff I don't,

23
00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.190
as I just said,
I am still learning.

24
00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:47.300
But I will say that I do know the way broadly enough that I now see it

25
00:01:49.381 --> 00:01:51.900
everywhere and in everything.
So

26
00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:55.060
<v 1>how did I learn the way?</v>

27
00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:02.530
<v 0>Well it's kind of interesting cause it's a combination of actually it's more of</v>

28
00:02:02.531 --> 00:02:04.420
a collision of a bunch of different things.

29
00:02:04.421 --> 00:02:09.421
Of course my time in the seal teams and I do trace a lot of it back to the seal

30
00:02:10.751 --> 00:02:12.250
platoon where we had a little mutiny.

31
00:02:12.251 --> 00:02:17.251
We hired a bad boss and we ended up turning against him and he got fired and

32
00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:21.130
replaced by the best boss and,

33
00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:25.390
and the juxtaposition and the contrast between really good leadership and really

34
00:02:25.391 --> 00:02:28.540
badly or ship made it very clear.

35
00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:30.113
<v 1>Okay.</v>

36
00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:32.870
<v 0>But it wasn't just that I,
of course,</v>

37
00:02:32.871 --> 00:02:37.760
I had other great guys that I work with in the seal teams that taught me a ton

38
00:02:37.761 --> 00:02:42.320
of great instructor cadre that put me through training,

39
00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:45.140
taught me a ton and you want,

40
00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:50.120
I realized I always paid close attention to leadership and tactics and I think

41
00:02:50.121 --> 00:02:54.500
that's probably because I sought something that I might be able to get good at.

42
00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:58.340
Since there was a lot of things that I wasn't naturally good,

43
00:02:58.341 --> 00:03:01.810
I wasn't naturally the strongest,
I wasn't naturally the fastest,

44
00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:04.540
I wasn't naturally the best shot.

45
00:03:04.541 --> 00:03:08.680
So I kind of paid attention to leadership and I paid attention to who did it

46
00:03:08.681 --> 00:03:09.760
well and who didn't.

47
00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:14.260
And I paid attention to tactics and I paid attention to what worked and what

48
00:03:14.261 --> 00:03:16.210
didn't.
From a tactical perspective,

49
00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:21.100
and I read now,
I will tell you right now,

50
00:03:21.101 --> 00:03:23.980
I did not read a lot by any stretch,

51
00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:26.380
especially compared to how much I read right now.

52
00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:32.250
But I read some important books that had a big impact on me.

53
00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:38.610
And of course they were only books about war and in those books about war,

54
00:03:38.771 --> 00:03:43.270
the things that I actually paid attention to,
it wasn't like the,

55
00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:48.490
wasn't the,
the the political situation that was going on.

56
00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:52.270
I,
I paid attention to the leadership.
I paid attention to the tactics.

57
00:03:52.271 --> 00:03:57.271
I paid attention to the human nature of how men reacted to war.

58
00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:01.780
And so some of those books,
and again,

59
00:04:01.781 --> 00:04:06.781
it wasn't a lot about face with the old breed battle leadership,

60
00:04:07.541 --> 00:04:08.650
the last hundred yards,

61
00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:13.360
some very straightforward books and books that I'd covered early on this
podcast.

62
00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:17.380
And then of course on top of that I got lucky with my deployments overseas and I

63
00:04:17.381 --> 00:04:22.030
got to experience war from a leadership perspective

64
00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:28.360
and I started to see how things overlapped and intertwined.

65
00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:35.370
And one of the things that really helped me see the connections between

66
00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:40.800
leadership and tactics and human nature and life in general was Jujitsu.

67
00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:48.310
I talk about digital a lot.
Obviously we talk about Jujitsu a lot.

68
00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:52.840
Jujitsu is a simple,
straight forward,

69
00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:56.290
practical representation of the way.

70
00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:00.790
If you think about what you did too,
hasn't it?
Right?
It has.

71
00:05:00.791 --> 00:05:03.520
Oftentimes it has defense.
It has flanking,

72
00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:08.470
they'd has conservation of energy.
It has deception.

73
00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:12.160
It has attack.
It has concentration of effort.

74
00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:17.200
It has position improving your position.
It has maneuvering.

75
00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:22.290
It has placing Bates and using faints and always keeping your base and keeping

76
00:05:23.171 --> 00:05:26.680
your balance while at the same time trying to upset your opponents.
Now,

77
00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:30.100
everything I just said,
you could use that for combat,

78
00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:34.180
for tactical situations.
You could also use it in business.

79
00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:39.450
You could use it in interactions with other human beings as you maneuver through

80
00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:47.670
human nature and how it you interact with it and their psychological elements

81
00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:52.330
inside of Jujitsu as well that are reflected humility.

82
00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:58.440
You're gonna get humbled by Jujitsu and at the same time dichotomy,

83
00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:03.530
you're going to gain confidence.
You're going to know the truth.

84
00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:06.350
You're going to know where you actually stand.

85
00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:11.120
You know it's not you're going to get a belt,
but that belt,

86
00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:16.490
it only represents
it only.

87
00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:20.330
It doesn't fully represent the reality of the situation.

88
00:06:20.331 --> 00:06:23.930
The reality of the situation is the truth.
And in Jujitsu,
you know the truth.

89
00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:28.220
You're going to be vulnerable.
You're going to,
you're psychologically,

90
00:06:28.221 --> 00:06:29.810
you're going to learn about tenacity.
You're going to,

91
00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:32.840
you're going to have to have grit,
you're going to have to have durability,

92
00:06:32.841 --> 00:06:34.220
you're going to have to have stability.

93
00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:40.520
And as I trained Jujitsu and I had garnered a better understanding of Jujitsu,

94
00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:46.200
I just started to have a better understanding of the way.

95
00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:51.740
And as I learned the way on the maths,

96
00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:56.540
the way revealed itself in combat,
it revealed itself in leadership,

97
00:06:56.660 --> 00:06:59.090
in human nature and in life.

98
00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:06.090
Because as you and I talk about this as well as you understand things from

99
00:07:06.311 --> 00:07:08.590
different angles,
right?

100
00:07:08.591 --> 00:07:12.760
So when you learned the way in different disciplines and you start to see it

101
00:07:12.761 --> 00:07:16.420
from different angles,
and eventually

102
00:07:18.370 --> 00:07:20.590
I came to understand the way broadly

103
00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:26.510
and now I do see it in everything.
And this is another thing.

104
00:07:26.660 --> 00:07:29.120
The more I see it in everything,

105
00:07:29.510 --> 00:07:32.240
the more I see it in everything.

106
00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:37.400
So understanding the way,
like I said,

107
00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:41.780
a lot of it had to do with this thread.
And I talked about it when we,

108
00:07:41.810 --> 00:07:46.280
when we talked about judo,
I talked about how Jujitsu is the thing that started.

109
00:07:46.281 --> 00:07:49.610
I started to see a connective thread between these,

110
00:07:50.690 --> 00:07:53.150
between these different disciplines

111
00:07:55.210 --> 00:07:57.970
and
a lot of it.

112
00:07:58.630 --> 00:08:03.340
My understanding of Jujitsu helped me in every other aspect and a lot of my,

113
00:08:03.341 --> 00:08:07.540
in fact the vast majority of my understanding of Jujitsu comes from one person

114
00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:14.280
and the person I was lucky enough to learn from the,

115
00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:16.450
as a pioneer of the sport

116
00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:21.820
considered by many people to be one of the greatest rappers ever

117
00:08:24.230 --> 00:08:29.190
a PR.
He's a practitioner that actually revolutionized the sport of Jiu Jitsu and

118
00:08:29.191 --> 00:08:34.080
grappling and his influence is still evident today.

119
00:08:34.590 --> 00:08:37.050
World champion multiple times over.

120
00:08:37.380 --> 00:08:41.730
Also a mixed martial arts fighter who has faced some of the best in the world

121
00:08:41.731 --> 00:08:44.550
and some of the biggest arenas in that sport

122
00:08:46.230 --> 00:08:51.230
and someone who I've trained on the mats of Justice with for over 20 years and

123
00:08:52.831 --> 00:08:56.100
who's been a close friend of mine.
That whole through

124
00:08:56.430 --> 00:09:01.430
<v 2>many ups and downs through victories and defeats through struggles of life on</v>

125
00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:05.850
and off the mat,
master of Jujitsu and

126
00:09:07.770 --> 00:09:09.210
more important a friend of mine,

127
00:09:09.270 --> 00:09:14.220
my brother Dean lister who is now finally coming on the show.

128
00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:18.900
Dean,
welcome to the show shut.
Gow

129
00:09:20.910 --> 00:09:24.450
great to be a brother.
Thank you for the invite.
Yeah,
man.
Uh,

130
00:09:25.110 --> 00:09:27.540
let's start at the beginning and I was thinking about,

131
00:09:27.541 --> 00:09:30.060
I know a little bit about your beginning and,

132
00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:32.580
but I actually didn't realize that,

133
00:09:32.581 --> 00:09:35.910
I know that you were raised somewhat in Panama,

134
00:09:36.420 --> 00:09:39.780
but where were you actually born?
Born in Camp Pendleton.

135
00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:43.160
Osha side here in San Diego.
Was Your Dad was in the marines,
right?
That's right.

136
00:09:44.150 --> 00:09:49.070
So I'm a native of San Diego,
but um,
two years ago,
up in Venezuela,
uh,

137
00:09:49.230 --> 00:09:51.420
two years in Panama and uh,

138
00:09:51.570 --> 00:09:53.760
my whole life had been on all around the world and traveling,

139
00:09:53.820 --> 00:09:57.540
learning in the world and it was very important to study.
How old were you?

140
00:09:57.541 --> 00:10:01.590
How old were you when you moved to Venezuela?
I was in third grade,
so eight,

141
00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:04.500
nine years to go right into Spanish speaking school.

142
00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:08.310
They had English and Spanish at the time.
I didn't speak Spanish.

143
00:10:08.490 --> 00:10:09.690
That was actually a problem for me.

144
00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:14.610
And I actually learned Spanish fluently when I lived in Panama was a junior high

145
00:10:15.030 --> 00:10:17.130
and that was of course you go to a Spanish school,

146
00:10:17.550 --> 00:10:20.460
Spanish speaking school or did you just learn it out in the streets?

147
00:10:21.510 --> 00:10:25.920
I learned best from let's say free rolling.
Say talking,
saying something,

148
00:10:26.130 --> 00:10:28.830
you do it wrong.
You actually learn how to speak better.
Uh,

149
00:10:28.870 --> 00:10:32.220
so I've actually been dropped off in countries and learn languages that way.

150
00:10:32.221 --> 00:10:37.050
It's the best way actually.
So you have no choice.
Immersion.
Immersion.
Exactly.
Um,

151
00:10:37.230 --> 00:10:42.230
in Panama it was a dod depart of different school and that matter of fact,

152
00:10:42.841 --> 00:10:44.000
they used my junior highs.

153
00:10:44.050 --> 00:10:48.010
There's a hospital field hospital and during the Panama invasion and uh,
that,

154
00:10:48.040 --> 00:10:50.310
that's where I actually learned Spanish.
Uh,

155
00:10:50.430 --> 00:10:52.980
I had survival Spanish when I was a little kid,
but Panama.

156
00:10:52.981 --> 00:10:56.970
What years did you live in Panama?
89 88.
So I was a seventh and eighth grade.

157
00:10:57.360 --> 00:10:59.460
Around that time,
seventh and eighth grade.
You lived in Panama?

158
00:10:59.461 --> 00:11:01.420
The invasion went down in 89 with this,

159
00:11:01.590 --> 00:11:04.770
I think December of September 18th or 20th,
forget.
Yeah,

160
00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:10.170
and you are like in it,
it was a,
it was happening around you.
What happened was,

161
00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:13.960
uh,
Fort Amador,
which actually means Fort Lover in Spanish.

162
00:11:14.430 --> 00:11:16.650
It's a navy base.
It's not a very big base,

163
00:11:17.130 --> 00:11:19.380
but it's the only base in Panama that was,

164
00:11:19.470 --> 00:11:22.920
were trying to make a joint effort to have half Panamanian.
Well,

165
00:11:23.790 --> 00:11:28.790
imagine I was in the middle of about maybe 80 yards from where my house was down

166
00:11:29.701 --> 00:11:33.760
a hill about 40 guys got massacred there,

167
00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:38.820
a front gate to the base.
Um,
some pdf,
the pediment to French forces,

168
00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.340
police,
military,
same thing down there.
They,

169
00:11:41.580 --> 00:11:45.870
they did try to run a marine roadblock in a bus that's not going to work out

170
00:11:45.871 --> 00:11:48.950
good for them.
And uh,
the marine side,
50 cal,
just

171
00:11:50.550 --> 00:11:54.040
the bus grinded to a halt of basically

172
00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:57.490
<v 3>didn't make it.
And so,
yeah.
What did they do with the families during that time?</v>

173
00:11:58.010 --> 00:12:01.440
What's the like what did your,
I mean,
your dad died after worker.
He was,

174
00:12:01.560 --> 00:12:05.680
he was at quarry heights,
which was the main headquarters.
So he was,
uh,

175
00:12:05.770 --> 00:12:10.720
basically underground this big rock,
and he could not tell us.
So he knew,

176
00:12:10.860 --> 00:12:14.320
but there's no way it was like top secret,
whatever,
compartmentalize,

177
00:12:14.321 --> 00:12:17.110
whatever you would say as far as he couldn't let us know and they didn't,

178
00:12:17.230 --> 00:12:19.960
he didn't,
didn't send you out of the country.

179
00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:24.220
It happened real fast because they killed a marine lieutenant,

180
00:12:24.250 --> 00:12:28.720
I believe her name was lieutenant pause.
And uh,
that was,
uh,
maybe,
yeah,

181
00:12:28.750 --> 00:12:31.840
that was not the reason.
That was the straw that not the straw,

182
00:12:31.841 --> 00:12:35.470
that boulder that broke the camel's back for sure.
And,
uh,
sending,
uh,

183
00:12:35.590 --> 00:12:39.850
all our forces.
And that caused me some problems though,
Eh,
and school because,

184
00:12:40.830 --> 00:12:45.270
uh,
most of the kids were Panamanian kids that were,
they called them [inaudible].

185
00:12:45.430 --> 00:12:49.330
Their parents worked on the Panama Canal.
And so they were pretty well off.

186
00:12:49.390 --> 00:12:53.050
I went,
did,
he's in a school down there.
And because of that,
everyone,

187
00:12:53.230 --> 00:12:56.140
everyone from Panama had an uncle or a cousin who died.

188
00:12:56.440 --> 00:13:00.550
And so they see me,
by the way,
I was a goofy little kid.

189
00:13:01.710 --> 00:13:06.070
I'm not saying I wasn't tough,
it was just goofy,
so didn't speak Spanish.
Uh,

190
00:13:06.250 --> 00:13:09.760
I was goofy.
Uh,
my social skills were a little bit awkward.

191
00:13:09.820 --> 00:13:14.360
Maybe they are to this day actually.
And uh,
that's a recipe for disaster.
Right.

192
00:13:14.490 --> 00:13:17.950
So scrawny,
I was always,

193
00:13:19.060 --> 00:13:22.900
I was always tough,
scrawny,
but I wasn't,
I didn't get big until I was like 16,

194
00:13:22.901 --> 00:13:25.480
17 and started growing real fast.
Yeah.

195
00:13:26.020 --> 00:13:29.020
And so you were getting scraps down their basic rights cause you were in a

196
00:13:29.021 --> 00:13:33.040
gringo.
Oh,
can go.
We call this Yankee down there.
Gringo didn't exist.

197
00:13:33.040 --> 00:13:37.090
That's everyone was Yankee go home.
It was everywhere.

198
00:13:37.590 --> 00:13:39.170
And it just felt wrong.
Hoem

199
00:13:40.780 --> 00:13:45.610
and Yankee was y a n Q.
U.
I smelled like Spanish.
So the school was on base.

200
00:13:45.790 --> 00:13:50.770
No,
no,
you take a bus.
Matter of fact,
it was really stupid.
Um,

201
00:13:51.310 --> 00:13:55.600
the Iti had a failed coup about,
I think two weeks before the invasion.

202
00:13:56.140 --> 00:13:58.040
One of a Noriega,
Manuel Noriega's,

203
00:13:58.070 --> 00:14:02.080
a top guys generals successfully took them down.

204
00:14:02.530 --> 00:14:03.890
And uh,

205
00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:07.990
the loyalist tube to Noriega came to his rescue and the general surrendered.

206
00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:11.380
But that day the country was on high alert.

207
00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:14.530
And we're going home on the bus back to get dropped off it,

208
00:14:14.560 --> 00:14:19.090
but to my base and other bases and uh,
the penny,

209
00:14:19.091 --> 00:14:24.090
meaning a pdf,
penny meaning defense force skies when a machine gun nest just,

210
00:14:24.730 --> 00:14:28.960
and I'm telling you all these high school kids,
I knew enough to just shut up.

211
00:14:29.170 --> 00:14:31.870
They opened the window and started talking and these guys and these guys had,

212
00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:38.980
what are the [inaudible] w was pointed right at us and they were like looking at

213
00:14:38.981 --> 00:14:41.290
us and I'm man,
they didn't shoot us.

214
00:14:41.291 --> 00:14:45.400
But that was one of the things when you're young,
you do stupid things.

215
00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:50.410
So yeah.
So I was right there.
It was,
um,
that was a crazy time.

216
00:14:50.411 --> 00:14:55.400
It was good though.
I'm actually glad.
Uh,
and this is,
oh,
I was teased Jocko,

217
00:14:55.401 --> 00:14:57.890
which is,
I don't think he appreciates it,
but I was like,
chocolate.

218
00:14:57.940 --> 00:15:02.180
I saw war before you.
It's true.

219
00:15:03.100 --> 00:15:04.400
Junk was like,
yeah,
whatever.

220
00:15:04.700 --> 00:15:09.700
So I've seen one 10th of 1% or whatever of 10 years old.

221
00:15:10.240 --> 00:15:12.830
I was 1313.
It's actually,

222
00:15:13.220 --> 00:15:16.250
you actually had more of an understanding if you were a little bit younger.
Yeah.

223
00:15:16.251 --> 00:15:17.450
You might not really get it,

224
00:15:17.810 --> 00:15:20.420
but you got enough understanding to realize that you are in danger and stuff.

225
00:15:20.450 --> 00:15:23.840
Yeah.
So for 24 hours we were all alone,
pitch dark.
Uh,

226
00:15:24.170 --> 00:15:26.960
basically I was just on the ground for three days and,
uh,

227
00:15:27.110 --> 00:15:31.130
my mom filled the bathtub with water and I thought it was gonna die.
It really,

228
00:15:31.460 --> 00:15:35.600
you know,
you're 12 years old,
didn't make a lot,
but uh,
that changed my life.

229
00:15:35.601 --> 00:15:37.430
I should just stop just to have that experience.

230
00:15:37.510 --> 00:15:41.870
It's actually a good thing on base that was secured by,
it wasn't US forces,

231
00:15:42.140 --> 00:15:43.340
it was becoming security.

232
00:15:43.370 --> 00:15:46.970
It was the only base in Panama that was half Panamanian across the street,

233
00:15:46.971 --> 00:15:48.470
down a hill was the Panamanian officers.

234
00:15:48.650 --> 00:15:52.860
So it was a joint effort and my situation,
most of the,
uh,

235
00:15:52.910 --> 00:15:57.500
us kids or like for Howard,
they were an Rodman.
There were over this hills,

236
00:15:57.920 --> 00:16:02.840
they heard gunshots and uh,
you know,
concussions,
whatever.

237
00:16:03.050 --> 00:16:05.600
But they didn't see anything.
Right.
That might've seen you a few tracers.

238
00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:08.540
But yeah,
it was right in the middle day rounds.
Hit Your House.
Uh,

239
00:16:09.110 --> 00:16:11.580
w we are top of the hill.
So a few things,
uh,

240
00:16:11.630 --> 00:16:16.630
chip the top of our roof and for sure if you want by windows someone could shoot

241
00:16:16.781 --> 00:16:20.180
you.
So we didn't do that of course.
And we just drink out of a bathtub.

242
00:16:20.230 --> 00:16:22.610
It was just you and your you and you're my sister,
sister.

243
00:16:22.670 --> 00:16:25.490
My Mom and dad was at work.
My Dad was,
he was working,

244
00:16:26.330 --> 00:16:29.270
he must have freaked out our neighbor,

245
00:16:29.300 --> 00:16:33.200
we had giant yards between these houses.
Nice houses actually.

246
00:16:33.320 --> 00:16:37.430
And the neighbor,
she was all by herself,
so it was just no cage.

247
00:16:37.460 --> 00:16:41.030
She ran over,
uh,
across us,
I'd say a hundred yards.

248
00:16:41.210 --> 00:16:45.120
The yards were really wide and she's knocking our doors.
She came inside.
She,

249
00:16:45.410 --> 00:16:48.110
we had a fourth.
It was young,
young lady to me.

250
00:16:48.111 --> 00:16:50.420
It was an old lady for about 25 to me.

251
00:16:50.421 --> 00:16:53.280
That was an older person you have ever seen in her life.
She came in,

252
00:16:53.281 --> 00:16:56.160
she had leave any weapons at the house.
Damn.

253
00:16:57.370 --> 00:17:01.250
I've been like daddy for a reason.
I would have strapped up and go get,

254
00:17:01.251 --> 00:17:04.490
not really,
but yeah,
my dad was a,
yeah,
it was just a sudden thing.

255
00:17:04.491 --> 00:17:08.030
It was short notice.
And he was,
yeah,
but happening around,
I don't know,

256
00:17:08.031 --> 00:17:11.420
11 before midnight,
1135 or something.

257
00:17:11.710 --> 00:17:16.710
I thought it was firecrackers first and just shaking and flashes everywhere.

258
00:17:17.680 --> 00:17:20.810
Just chaotic chaos.
And then did you finish out that school year?

259
00:17:20.811 --> 00:17:24.870
So that goes down in December.
It was Scott [inaudible] pretty quickly.
Yeah,

260
00:17:24.890 --> 00:17:29.210
let's say three days of two days of very intense.
First Day was the most,

261
00:17:29.330 --> 00:17:31.790
second was serious,
third was okay.

262
00:17:31.970 --> 00:17:36.100
And the next week was just mop up operations.
So it's still for 10 days it was,

263
00:17:36.150 --> 00:17:38.410
it was dangerous.
But the first,
um,

264
00:17:38.870 --> 00:17:43.070
one of my teachers from my junior high got got killed and a wizard just out in

265
00:17:43.071 --> 00:17:45.860
the street.
They're long time and he was living in town actually.

266
00:17:45.890 --> 00:17:50.010
That's why he's in the wrong place.
Wrong time.
I don't know how I got shot,

267
00:17:50.010 --> 00:17:54.720
<v 2>but I'm not,
I'm not sure by who,
but the wrong place.
Wrong time.
So,
uh,</v>

268
00:17:54.840 --> 00:17:56.340
yeah,
right in the middle of it.
Yeah.

269
00:17:57.060 --> 00:18:00.780
We used to go down to Panama to do jungle training and is awesome.

270
00:18:00.781 --> 00:18:05.310
But it was after.
I mean this is in the nineties so,
but I,

271
00:18:05.311 --> 00:18:08.190
we went in and we'd look around and try and find,
you know,

272
00:18:08.191 --> 00:18:12.090
where some of these battles took place in.
And it was interesting.

273
00:18:12.150 --> 00:18:15.870
So then when you,
you see,
did you finish out that school year?

274
00:18:15.990 --> 00:18:20.340
Halfway through we moved to San Diego.
Okay.
To high school down here.

275
00:18:20.490 --> 00:18:23.850
And then you went down.
Now if you were down there,
did you start,

276
00:18:24.570 --> 00:18:27.450
did you start getting interested in martial arts when you getting picked on?

277
00:18:27.480 --> 00:18:28.410
I was doing karate.

278
00:18:28.770 --> 00:18:32.100
Karate now I did wrestling for one year when I was eight years old.

279
00:18:32.101 --> 00:18:35.220
My Dad made me do it and I didn't like it at the time,

280
00:18:35.640 --> 00:18:38.910
but I'm really glad he made me do it cause that helped me a lot in flights.

281
00:18:39.060 --> 00:18:42.180
It's a weird,
it's a weird thing with kids.

282
00:18:42.420 --> 00:18:46.710
Like you know that it's good that he made you do it.
But if he,
he might,
he,

283
00:18:46.711 --> 00:18:49.540
if he made you do it even more,
I might be,
you would just say,
Hey,

284
00:18:50.070 --> 00:18:52.150
I'm not getting the wrestling high school.
I wanted to wrestle.

285
00:18:52.151 --> 00:18:55.290
And so that's good.
So then we got to San Diego and now,

286
00:18:55.520 --> 00:18:58.350
and you also played football.
Yes.
Where you better at football?

287
00:18:58.351 --> 00:19:00.360
Are you better at wrestling?
Wrestling?
I was a good tackler.

288
00:19:00.580 --> 00:19:04.530
I was one of the top one or two best tacklers not the fastest guy,

289
00:19:05.310 --> 00:19:08.940
an average.
But really my body is not made for sprinting.

290
00:19:08.941 --> 00:19:12.780
It's made for grabbing people.
Did you start,
did you,
you are a mutant.
Um,

291
00:19:12.810 --> 00:19:15.870
did you start,
did you,
was that,
so you,

292
00:19:16.020 --> 00:19:17.700
what grade was it that you wrestled in for one year?

293
00:19:17.730 --> 00:19:22.440
Is that like sixth grade or something?
Oh,
you said you were 39 years old maybe.

294
00:19:22.441 --> 00:19:25.290
So now your freshman year in high school was the first year that you actually

295
00:19:25.291 --> 00:19:26.490
started wrestling freshmen.

296
00:19:26.580 --> 00:19:30.390
I skipped 10th grade because I wanted to focus on weights and football mistake,

297
00:19:30.391 --> 00:19:31.224
but it's okay.

298
00:19:31.420 --> 00:19:35.580
And then 11th and 12th grade I wrestled and I was varsity 11 to 12 and I was,

299
00:19:35.581 --> 00:19:40.230
the regional did that well with out that much experience.
I don't know why,

300
00:19:40.231 --> 00:19:43.250
but for me,
well I do know why because you're,
you know,

301
00:19:43.260 --> 00:19:48.210
you just joked about being like a mute and grappler,

302
00:19:48.211 --> 00:19:50.400
but you actually literally have

303
00:19:52.800 --> 00:19:57.620
like you were designed to grapple,
serious ran.
Uh,

304
00:19:58.080 --> 00:20:03.000
so yeah.
So that's proof right there.
Is that you,

305
00:20:03.060 --> 00:20:03.600
is that you,

306
00:20:03.600 --> 00:20:06.990
you wrestled once when you were eight years old and then you wrestled and

307
00:20:06.991 --> 00:20:09.090
freshman year and then,
I mean there's kids,

308
00:20:09.390 --> 00:20:12.780
there's kids that wrestled their whole lives in there that you're wrestling

309
00:20:12.781 --> 00:20:15.960
against.
Yes.
And how did you do?
Uh,

310
00:20:15.961 --> 00:20:20.840
I would say South Bay regional champion.
I took third and county.
Um,

311
00:20:21.690 --> 00:20:24.960
I wasn't that good until 1920 for some reason.

312
00:20:24.961 --> 00:20:28.680
This submission arts sambal and a Jujitsu guys who will beat me in high school.

313
00:20:28.710 --> 00:20:33.480
What you said,
1920,
19 2019 or 20.
Oh,
okay.
Got around the time I got out for that.

314
00:20:33.481 --> 00:20:36.900
It can coordinate it.
I was kind of clumsy when I was 17.

315
00:20:37.380 --> 00:20:41.280
So those kids that beat me,
one guy beat me,
almost tech falls me,

316
00:20:41.281 --> 00:20:43.710
which means almost got 15 to two army or whatever.

317
00:20:44.050 --> 00:20:48.010
He was from our local high school.
And I faced him in a after

318
00:20:48.010 --> 00:20:51.660
<v 3>high school and I pinned him in 30 seconds.
So I dunno why,</v>

319
00:20:51.670 --> 00:20:56.670
just a late bloomer and also you have this natural gift that you'd hadn't

320
00:20:57.190 --> 00:21:00.400
started to hone yet and once you started to hone age just started to make sense.

321
00:21:00.401 --> 00:21:04.270
It was the submission that got me really interested and just,
okay,

322
00:21:04.360 --> 00:21:06.690
so from eight since Samba,

323
00:21:06.720 --> 00:21:09.870
right psalm was your introduction to subway did Jujitsu?
Yes.

324
00:21:09.950 --> 00:21:13.780
Sambos for those would don't know.
It's,
it's a Russian grappling style.

325
00:21:14.230 --> 00:21:17.710
I would roughly compare it maybe in the middle of judo and Entergy sued because

326
00:21:17.711 --> 00:21:22.360
they the stress a little more wrestling then judo and a little more submissions.

327
00:21:23.100 --> 00:21:24.130
It's in the middle that say,
yeah.

328
00:21:24.680 --> 00:21:28.540
So I would say it's sort of like in the middle of wrestling,

329
00:21:28.930 --> 00:21:31.450
judo and Jujitsu.
Like you got to put all three of them together.

330
00:21:31.510 --> 00:21:35.530
It's like a collage because you wear a jacket,
jacket,
shorts,

331
00:21:35.540 --> 00:21:39.920
you wear shorts and shoes.
Yeah.
Which is,
which is literally,

332
00:21:39.950 --> 00:21:43.090
he combination of everything go for foot.
Locks was in judo.

333
00:21:43.091 --> 00:21:46.600
You can't go from foot logs.
Uh,
you can go for a single leg,
double leg.

334
00:21:46.630 --> 00:21:51.250
We're in judo.
You can't do that.
So,
um,
yeah.
Where'd you hear about Samba?

335
00:21:51.670 --> 00:21:56.670
My was my off season coach named Jerry Matsumoto down at my high school,

336
00:21:56.951 --> 00:22:01.150
hilltop high school,
and Chew lavise.here in San Diego and an off season.

337
00:22:01.151 --> 00:22:05.890
He was teaching this thing called Sambo.
This is right,
right before UFC one.
So,

338
00:22:06.610 --> 00:22:10.480
um,
and what's that stuff with the jacket and what's this?
And they said,
oh,

339
00:22:10.481 --> 00:22:14.230
this is submission.
What is a submission?
I was like,
17,
oh,

340
00:22:14.231 --> 00:22:16.840
you can get your arm broken.
I'm like,
and I told myself,

341
00:22:16.900 --> 00:22:20.260
and this is something that this one,
the not few,

342
00:22:20.290 --> 00:22:23.200
several things Jocko and myself share,
we haven't common.

343
00:22:23.770 --> 00:22:28.630
I told myself at age 17,
even though I was uncoordinated,
I said,
that's scary.

344
00:22:28.780 --> 00:22:32.840
And I now I have to do it.
I gotta do it now.
If I don't do it now,
I'm uh,
I'm,
uh,

345
00:22:33.220 --> 00:22:34.270
I'll feel ashamed of myself.

346
00:22:34.540 --> 00:22:39.130
So I did it for some reason that guys that could beat me in Greco or freestyle,

347
00:22:39.131 --> 00:22:41.230
I could submit them.
I don't know why.
I have no idea why,

348
00:22:41.260 --> 00:22:43.360
but it was making sense for me.
And uh,

349
00:22:43.390 --> 00:22:48.180
then I went to Jiu Jitsu at fabulous sound,
those
and,

350
00:22:48.190 --> 00:22:52.300
and you know,
you say like you were naturally good at Zombot and you were,

351
00:22:52.301 --> 00:22:56.110
and you,
you were like the national champion two time national champion in Samba,

352
00:22:56.111 --> 00:23:00.220
right?
Yeah,
it's amateur.
At that time it wasn't really super popular,

353
00:23:00.221 --> 00:23:05.221
but that prepared me in the American rules of Sambal because the athletic

354
00:23:05.870 --> 00:23:10.210
commissioner,
the union was a no twisting submissions,

355
00:23:10.240 --> 00:23:11.110
no chokes.

356
00:23:11.500 --> 00:23:14.650
So street full lock straight and you lock in the street on lock so you can get

357
00:23:14.651 --> 00:23:17.200
good.
Those three submissions,
three submissions then yes,

358
00:23:17.260 --> 00:23:19.930
because those were the days where they thought,
oh,

359
00:23:19.931 --> 00:23:23.170
like Steven Seagal grabbed your neck and breaks it,
you'll die.
Oh,
you get choked.

360
00:23:23.171 --> 00:23:25.780
You Die.
Yeah.
Like,
oh by the way,
that ruins war movies.

361
00:23:25.781 --> 00:23:29.320
When I see the guy sneak up behind you down with a machine gun that chokes him

362
00:23:29.560 --> 00:23:31.270
and the guy's like done for the movie.
I'm like,

363
00:23:31.271 --> 00:23:33.160
he's going to wake up in 10 seconds and then shoot you.

364
00:23:33.740 --> 00:23:37.600
So kind of add to kind of separate myself.
At the moment,
but,
but yeah,

365
00:23:38.140 --> 00:23:39.850
at that time,
right at the time,

366
00:23:39.860 --> 00:23:44.830
USC one to peel thought it's important for people to know that there's a key

367
00:23:44.960 --> 00:23:46.040
element here in Samba

368
00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:48.680
<v 2>is that the foot lock,
the straight full locking,
the knee,</v>

369
00:23:48.850 --> 00:23:53.180
the straight knee lock was one with the two of the three submissions you were

370
00:23:53.181 --> 00:23:56.780
allowed to do and you were good at them.

371
00:23:58.300 --> 00:24:02.350
When I studied Higgs would tell you this.
Oh,
and our good friends,
Jeff Higgs,
uh,

372
00:24:02.600 --> 00:24:04.910
I came in there and actually was submitting guys and uh,

373
00:24:05.450 --> 00:24:09.020
but they didn't like that because yeah,
I was,
I was the sambal kid.
Oh,

374
00:24:09.021 --> 00:24:11.490
that's right kid for awhile,

375
00:24:11.750 --> 00:24:14.900
for awhile I used to get people in bear hugs from the guard and make them top.

376
00:24:15.110 --> 00:24:19.440
I was like,
I was a mean little bastard.
I made a,
well,

377
00:24:19.640 --> 00:24:23.090
I don't think he's listening,
but if he has forgiven me,
but his name was John,

378
00:24:23.570 --> 00:24:27.230
he was,
this isn't coach for Fabio and he was blue belt for striped.
I came in,

379
00:24:27.260 --> 00:24:31.070
I caught him in full guard,
bear hug.
He's got you.
He tapped,

380
00:24:31.071 --> 00:24:35.420
he screamed and then he went,
he was crying.
But my back from the garden,

381
00:24:36.320 --> 00:24:39.470
that's all I knew so well and lived the past again,
you have some,

382
00:24:39.500 --> 00:24:41.230
you have some mutated um,

383
00:24:41.600 --> 00:24:46.600
structure that is maybe more for grappling than anything.

384
00:24:47.240 --> 00:24:50.240
It's very odd.
And,
and,
and,

385
00:24:51.010 --> 00:24:55.310
and I remember you told me you would like arm lock people in their,

386
00:24:55.311 --> 00:24:58.650
there you be in their garden and you arm lock them.
They'd reach for under oath.

387
00:24:58.700 --> 00:25:01.420
I locked my postulate that the time that they said,

388
00:25:01.790 --> 00:25:03.740
I didn't know you could arm lock someone from the garden.
I'm like,

389
00:25:03.830 --> 00:25:08.570
well they aren't there.
They're like,
well,
I was taught that's wrong.
And uh,

390
00:25:08.690 --> 00:25:11.680
well eventually I learned that that's not the best way to do it.
Yeah.

391
00:25:12.050 --> 00:25:15.530
And so then it was at UFC one where you said,
oh,
do Jitsu,

392
00:25:15.590 --> 00:25:16.910
what's going on with that?
Yeah,

393
00:25:16.911 --> 00:25:21.020
because that was the time when choke holds.
We're like,

394
00:25:21.021 --> 00:25:24.920
what do you feel like you're going to die?
Will you realize?
Not really the guy,

395
00:25:24.921 --> 00:25:29.270
you know,
second USC,
no one died 30 go see you in choke holds actually work.

396
00:25:29.780 --> 00:25:33.520
And nowadays people will can sometimes say,
oh,
Jitsu is,

397
00:25:34.500 --> 00:25:37.490
it's not the most,
it's really,
it's a base.
It's a prerequisite.

398
00:25:37.520 --> 00:25:42.440
You have to have the would be competitive.
So yeah,
very effective,

399
00:25:42.560 --> 00:25:43.131
very effective.

400
00:25:43.131 --> 00:25:48.131
And of course the sport has evolved technically over the years.

401
00:25:48.770 --> 00:25:53.770
If you look at technology and technique are kind of similar because they develop

402
00:25:53.811 --> 00:25:54.644
over time.

403
00:25:54.800 --> 00:25:58.760
The technique of boxing now is different in the 80s and that's different from

404
00:25:58.761 --> 00:26:03.620
the 50s football looks different now than back then.
Jitsu is the same thing,

405
00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:04.340
right?

406
00:26:04.340 --> 00:26:09.200
All kinds of things happening right now that no one even envisioned back in 1995

407
00:26:09.500 --> 00:26:11.840
and it compounds faster,
right?

408
00:26:11.870 --> 00:26:16.250
Like if you watch how fast technology's gotten has improved.

409
00:26:16.430 --> 00:26:21.380
If you watched the Jujitsu curve,
it's like the new moves,
you know,
back when we,

410
00:26:21.530 --> 00:26:25.940
when we started,
there'd be like a new move.
It wouldn't be locked up.

411
00:26:26.570 --> 00:26:28.850
Oh my God,
this is crazy that this could,

412
00:26:29.030 --> 00:26:31.510
someone came up with something and now there's,
you know,

413
00:26:31.550 --> 00:26:36.540
some blue belt tonight came up with like a sick of variation of a move and,

414
00:26:36.541 --> 00:26:40.300
and that's just the way it works.
So it's like everyone's better.
I,

415
00:26:40.470 --> 00:26:43.920
I started eight months,
I don't know,
maybe one year,
maybe six months before you.

416
00:26:44.010 --> 00:26:47.730
And so you for sure had already joined this time,

417
00:26:48.120 --> 00:26:51.840
but the Omoplata was a brand new move and if someone did that at a tournament I

418
00:26:51.841 --> 00:26:54.390
was like,
Oh look,
he's doing a brand new move and then we'll look at,

419
00:26:54.450 --> 00:26:58.890
take the VHS camcorders and look at it.
And was like,
oh that was a highlight.

420
00:26:58.891 --> 00:27:02.670
That was like the band Bolo or you know,
now it's leg locks up course.

421
00:27:02.700 --> 00:27:05.870
So what was it?
So was it the UFC when you ask you a few like all right,

422
00:27:05.871 --> 00:27:08.700
I got to find a Jujitsu gym and you open up the yellow pages or whatever.

423
00:27:10.200 --> 00:27:12.860
No one knows about like yellow pages.
No,

424
00:27:14.640 --> 00:27:19.320
Fabio had an ad in the San Diego Sr.
Yeah,
he was like this.

425
00:27:19.530 --> 00:27:20.041
That's where I,

426
00:27:20.041 --> 00:27:22.830
that's what I remembered that Fabio Santos had in the San Diego reader.

427
00:27:22.831 --> 00:27:23.880
I remember seeing that.

428
00:27:23.910 --> 00:27:27.600
But it was Higgs that brought me down cause Higgs had been trained in there for

429
00:27:27.610 --> 00:27:30.930
awhile.
So you,
you,

430
00:27:31.620 --> 00:27:35.310
I mean you were good fast,
right?

431
00:27:36.750 --> 00:27:40.650
Sometimes I'll think,
man,
I'm really faltering here.

432
00:27:41.310 --> 00:27:42.001
Nothing's happening,

433
00:27:42.001 --> 00:27:46.560
and then next month I realize I'm twice as good as I was and I'll go,

434
00:27:46.620 --> 00:27:49.890
what happened?
And then I feel like I'm losing ground.

435
00:27:49.920 --> 00:27:53.070
I think that's because you're learning.
Sometimes you,
you learn a little bit,

436
00:27:53.340 --> 00:27:56.790
but because it's something new you might be in better actually go down and

437
00:27:56.791 --> 00:27:58.750
performance.
Yeah,
because you're,

438
00:27:58.890 --> 00:28:02.190
you don't have that down yet and then of course you get it down to that higher

439
00:28:02.191 --> 00:28:04.700
level of technique.
Now you're up to here.
I explained that to business,

440
00:28:05.180 --> 00:28:07.890
like businesses want to implement a new process and I'm like,

441
00:28:07.891 --> 00:28:11.490
you have to tell the people that out of the gate you're going to get less

442
00:28:11.491 --> 00:28:13.680
efficient.
You implement a new process,

443
00:28:13.681 --> 00:28:17.010
you're going to get less efficient than once you master the new process,

444
00:28:17.011 --> 00:28:18.980
you'll get more efficient.
It's the same thing.
Would you do get to,

445
00:28:18.990 --> 00:28:20.190
you started implementing a new move,

446
00:28:20.191 --> 00:28:23.520
you're going to get worse and then once you master the move where you get good

447
00:28:23.521 --> 00:28:28.140
at to move,
then you'll start getting better again.
Did we go real fast?

448
00:28:28.370 --> 00:28:31.650
I'm going to,
I'm going to lend to you an analogy for that.

449
00:28:32.040 --> 00:28:36.330
This very simple I heard nowadays,
Kurt kids don't even learn cursive.

450
00:28:36.331 --> 00:28:37.170
Now I heard that,
I don't know,

451
00:28:37.200 --> 00:28:41.040
but he learned printing and a few years you're writing your name,

452
00:28:42.190 --> 00:28:43.650
it put glitter on it.
You give it to your mom.

453
00:28:43.651 --> 00:28:46.440
She puts in the fridge on a little kid riding,
but I don't have to.
For years,

454
00:28:46.441 --> 00:28:48.810
you're writing your name and you could write and say,

455
00:28:48.811 --> 00:28:50.330
we're going to learn cursive now.
Well,

456
00:28:50.610 --> 00:28:52.920
your cursive looks way more jacked up than your printing,

457
00:28:52.950 --> 00:28:56.910
but it's a more advanced form of writing.
So we get that down.
And then back then,

458
00:28:56.911 --> 00:29:00.750
by the way,
there's no typing in high school.
That was June.
It was college.

459
00:29:00.900 --> 00:29:04.260
So in college you learned typing.
Initially you're just like,
hm,

460
00:29:04.550 --> 00:29:08.340
you're slower than you would.
Right?
But eventually we aren't typing.
See,

461
00:29:08.370 --> 00:29:12.480
so your performance declines until you get the more advanced thing down in your

462
00:29:12.481 --> 00:29:14.970
head.
All of a sudden you can type 50 words,
60 words a minute.

463
00:29:15.210 --> 00:29:18.000
That's a more advanced,
more efficient way of typing or writing.

464
00:29:18.210 --> 00:29:19.080
So that's a good way.

465
00:29:19.260 --> 00:29:24.260
I express that idea to people who may not be in business that simple way,

466
00:29:24.450 --> 00:29:29.080
like that make sense?
That's why it doesn't make sense.
I'm trying to think.
So,

467
00:29:29.820 --> 00:29:34.260
um,
so we,
you and I,
I don't know why,

468
00:29:34.261 --> 00:29:37.380
but you and I immediately started training together like super hard all the
time.

469
00:29:37.500 --> 00:29:41.500
You were,
you were one of the guys,
like I mentioned,
if I say that's of scary,

470
00:29:41.530 --> 00:29:45.850
oh I got to do it.
Also,
if I say it would,
it would suck to be mounted.

471
00:29:46.330 --> 00:29:51.070
I'll all purpose start mounted.
And if we brought a bounce,
most people,

472
00:29:51.071 --> 00:29:53.320
Jocko was one of the few guys that if we wrote a bounds,

473
00:29:53.650 --> 00:29:56.560
Andy and I have a good position on him,

474
00:29:56.740 --> 00:30:01.420
he will insist we started an aisle,
I'll argue to actually like no,

475
00:30:01.510 --> 00:30:02.650
put your arm back where it was.

476
00:30:02.650 --> 00:30:06.250
Cause I actually want to have it reset to a what's harder for me.

477
00:30:06.460 --> 00:30:09.850
So if I go to bounce the,
that I think that's why.
And uh,

478
00:30:09.910 --> 00:30:12.790
first time I saw you Higgs,
he's like,
I have a friend named Jocko.

479
00:30:12.791 --> 00:30:16.720
Man knew he gets involved.
He just kind of like men,
you'll know,

480
00:30:17.320 --> 00:30:19.030
you'll see me Alice know and I'm like,
okay.

481
00:30:19.510 --> 00:30:23.850
So I knew you were coming in and you walked in and he were like Roger Yet and

482
00:30:24.880 --> 00:30:27.820
first day you got,
you got arm locked in and no emotion.

483
00:30:27.821 --> 00:30:30.730
Just you sit like the term benchmark and just

484
00:30:33.440 --> 00:30:37.240
this.
I was like,
Hey,
it's pretty hardcore,
you know?
Yeah,
yeah.

485
00:30:37.900 --> 00:30:40.330
But you were training hard.
You training hard.
It was pretty hard too.
That's fine.

486
00:30:40.331 --> 00:30:42.400
Yeah.
Yeah,
I remember,

487
00:30:42.490 --> 00:30:45.160
I just remember like almost immediately I was training with you a lot.

488
00:30:45.161 --> 00:30:48.040
Maybe it's cause we were,
I don't know.
We would,

489
00:30:48.041 --> 00:30:52.360
we would spend three hours after Saturday talking on the mat about things and

490
00:30:52.361 --> 00:30:54.760
techniques.
Like literally two hours open mat,

491
00:30:54.820 --> 00:30:58.240
three hours more technique every Saturday.
That's Saturday.

492
00:30:58.300 --> 00:31:00.620
Of course times were different back then.
Yeah.

493
00:31:01.030 --> 00:31:04.840
I was going crazy thinking about the fact,

494
00:31:04.910 --> 00:31:08.110
and there's,
so,
I don't know if this is,

495
00:31:08.200 --> 00:31:12.460
you guys can tell me if this is insecurity or what,

496
00:31:13.030 --> 00:31:18.030
but I like Higgs came to my house and Higgs was now Higgs had just got his

497
00:31:18.911 --> 00:31:22.060
purple belt and he came to my house and he,
well he called me and said,
hey,

498
00:31:22.061 --> 00:31:25.960
you want to train each look or you want to train?
And I said,
come on over man.

499
00:31:26.530 --> 00:31:29.840
And you know I was bigger than Higgs and he was long and he's,

500
00:31:30.040 --> 00:31:33.790
his legs go up to like his sternum.
So his legs,

501
00:31:33.791 --> 00:31:37.780
he's like a reason you can too.
And Triangle.
Yeah.

502
00:31:37.781 --> 00:31:42.010
And so he came over and we went in the grass across the street from the house

503
00:31:42.160 --> 00:31:46.330
and he's just worked me over.
And I was like,
and so again,

504
00:31:46.331 --> 00:31:48.520
you tell me if this is insecurity,
but I was like,

505
00:31:48.521 --> 00:31:52.930
I never want to have another man be able to impose his will on me like that.

506
00:31:52.980 --> 00:31:57.280
That is not the way I want to wait to look at things.
So by the time,

507
00:31:57.310 --> 00:32:02.310
so I literally went down to Fabio's the next day and signed up and he's like,

508
00:32:02.800 --> 00:32:04.450
do you want to try a class?
And I was like,
no,

509
00:32:04.570 --> 00:32:07.870
I just want to sign up unlimited classes 165 bucks a month here,

510
00:32:08.020 --> 00:32:11.440
take my money train.
And I remember,

511
00:32:11.690 --> 00:32:15.070
I remember you couldn't go immediately into the advanced class.

512
00:32:15.640 --> 00:32:17.530
You had to just take the beginner's class.
Yeah.

513
00:32:17.800 --> 00:32:21.130
And I don't know if I talked to him or I told him like,
Hey,

514
00:32:21.131 --> 00:32:24.370
I can't get her until later sometimes.
Can I just every go.
And He,

515
00:32:24.371 --> 00:32:27.760
and he was pretty cool,
you know,
he just said,
yeah.
And then,

516
00:32:28.350 --> 00:32:30.340
and so those times where,
you know,

517
00:32:30.341 --> 00:32:33.370
I just wanted to learn as much as I possibly possibly,

518
00:32:33.371 --> 00:32:38.371
possibly could because I didn't want to be at the of some other

519
00:32:40.040 --> 00:32:42.560
<v 0>human beings will.
Yeah.
It's an awful feeling.</v>

520
00:32:43.010 --> 00:32:45.960
There's some people that don't like that feeling and so they avoided completely.

521
00:32:46.090 --> 00:32:50.480
Yeah.
That's actually the more common,
that's the more common reaction.

522
00:32:50.630 --> 00:32:52.220
The more common reaction is,
oh,

523
00:32:52.640 --> 00:32:57.530
I don't like that situation because I get dominated and I have to submit to

524
00:32:57.531 --> 00:33:01.700
another man or woman by the way,

525
00:33:02.990 --> 00:33:07.220
I have to submit to this other man or woman and I hate that.

526
00:33:07.250 --> 00:33:09.890
So I'm just never going to get in this situation.

527
00:33:10.130 --> 00:33:11.630
The problem is as we know in life,

528
00:33:11.631 --> 00:33:14.570
you can't always avoid those situations and those situations can present

529
00:33:14.571 --> 00:33:17.570
themselves and you can't do anything about it.
So,

530
00:33:17.960 --> 00:33:21.890
so you and I just started training like maniacs.
Yeah.

531
00:33:21.980 --> 00:33:26.300
And the thing I was thinking about for,
for some reason,

532
00:33:27.170 --> 00:33:29.440
even in the beginning we did know,
gee,

533
00:33:30.320 --> 00:33:34.770
we would take our gies off so many times we would get yelled at sometimes and,

534
00:33:34.771 --> 00:33:35.690
and,
and for me,

535
00:33:35.691 --> 00:33:40.580
luckily I would teach guys at and the teams and I w I just would always wear

536
00:33:40.620 --> 00:33:43.280
Nogi.
I would just always wear a tee shirt and khaki pants.

537
00:33:43.310 --> 00:33:45.860
That was like the standard.
Yeah.
I was like,
if you want to train,
yeah.
Tee Shirt,

538
00:33:45.930 --> 00:33:46.880
khaki pants,
barefoot.

539
00:33:47.390 --> 00:33:51.260
And so I was almost immediately training Nogi because I was training at the team

540
00:33:51.261 --> 00:33:54.410
and I would be training guys even though we weren't highly skilled.

541
00:33:54.590 --> 00:33:57.830
But I was at least understanding that there were some nuance differences cause I

542
00:33:57.831 --> 00:34:00.380
didn't have the wrestling background that you had.
Yeah.

543
00:34:01.120 --> 00:34:02.840
Well it's good because you know,

544
00:34:02.960 --> 00:34:07.960
if you rely upon the uniform only and that's only how you're train no uniform,

545
00:34:08.151 --> 00:34:12.800
how are you going to be?
Yeah.
Yeah.
So then the other big thing here is,

546
00:34:12.950 --> 00:34:17.020
I mean we were competing a lot back then.
Yeah.

547
00:34:17.270 --> 00:34:22.270
We were competing a lot and those old school Jujitsu tournaments were freaking

548
00:34:22.701 --> 00:34:27.650
awesome back in the day.
They were,
they were super,

549
00:34:29.020 --> 00:34:31.790
they were crazy.
They were crazy.
Just trash back in the day,

550
00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:35.210
the Armenian guy and there was a riot.

551
00:34:36.120 --> 00:34:40.640
Oh it was canon.
It was,
it was crazy.
500 resilience and like 20 Armenian guys.

552
00:34:40.641 --> 00:34:43.250
And by the way,
my coach,

553
00:34:44.210 --> 00:34:47.660
you had a thing with that coach and,
and I'm not going to say what he said,

554
00:34:47.661 --> 00:34:49.400
but it wasn't very nice.

555
00:34:50.150 --> 00:34:53.660
The guy actually took me down to zero.
It had me to fall,

556
00:34:53.661 --> 00:34:57.470
like almost broke my foot,
but I escaped and I want Ethan to,
to like,
I was tough.

557
00:34:57.780 --> 00:35:02.690
I'd beat them.
And Fabio is culture.
Oh Sir.
He's coaching me.

558
00:35:03.020 --> 00:35:07.040
And of course the other coaches in Armenian seems to,
I don't speak Armenian,

559
00:35:07.190 --> 00:35:11.390
but uh,
for some reason that guy is not an official Jujitsu guy.

560
00:35:11.660 --> 00:35:15.410
More like a judo,
sambo,
whatever variant.
And right afterwards,

561
00:35:17.210 --> 00:35:19.490
yeah.
And because of that,

562
00:35:20.210 --> 00:35:24.230
there was a riot to Jujitsu.
I was,

563
00:35:24.231 --> 00:35:28.880
because my match hundreds of hundreds of people chanting Jujitsu and the judo,

564
00:35:28.990 --> 00:35:32.180
the Armenian guys were,
but they were actually,
they were great dudes.

565
00:35:32.700 --> 00:35:36.410
And like it was like the Carl Friesian crew.
It was all those guys,

566
00:35:36.530 --> 00:35:38.040
they were hard fighters.

567
00:35:38.250 --> 00:35:42.760
<v 2>They were telling were tough as hell.
And they were,
and they were,
uh,</v>

568
00:35:42.810 --> 00:35:46.590
connected to judo,
gene labella suits.
So it was like total respect.

569
00:35:46.591 --> 00:35:49.020
But I respect there was respect.

570
00:35:49.021 --> 00:35:54.021
I think that the disrespect came more from the Brazilian side and,

571
00:35:55.080 --> 00:35:55.411
well,

572
00:35:55.411 --> 00:35:58.640
I mean we were certainly associated with the Brazilians cause we had a Brazilian

573
00:35:58.650 --> 00:36:01.980
coach when we were doing Brazilian Jujitsu.
But,
uh,
yeah,
there was some,

574
00:36:01.981 --> 00:36:04.220
there was some mayhem,
but the guy car,

575
00:36:04.250 --> 00:36:07.080
he was in Cairo and actually he's like a mathematician now.

576
00:36:08.210 --> 00:36:11.050
I'm not going to fight anymore.
I'm a doctorate,
you know,
just

577
00:36:12.780 --> 00:36:15.870
find some strange people in the sport.
I mean the way that guy,

578
00:36:15.930 --> 00:36:17.670
he broke two people's feet,

579
00:36:17.700 --> 00:36:22.570
this is back in the day when they let it was more hard core as it was.

580
00:36:22.710 --> 00:36:24.450
It was,
uh,
it was,

581
00:36:24.780 --> 00:36:29.460
it was disrespectful to,
to tap to a foot lock,

582
00:36:30.020 --> 00:36:34.800
you know,
like,
oh,
you can't tap to that.
Uh,
you know,
those don't work.
You know,

583
00:36:34.890 --> 00:36:36.480
that's not technically,
you shouldn't have to that.

584
00:36:36.570 --> 00:36:40.710
So guys would just get their foot broken by these,
you know,
cause again,

585
00:36:40.740 --> 00:36:42.480
what could you know,
Jean Luc,
Jean the bell,
I mean his,

586
00:36:42.720 --> 00:36:47.720
his repertoire of super strong love of submissions is crazy and brutal.

587
00:36:49.980 --> 00:36:53.010
And so all those guys were coming in with that whole game plus there,

588
00:36:53.040 --> 00:36:57.480
whatever sambo background they had.
And there were some good,

589
00:36:57.660 --> 00:37:00.720
good competitions in and it was total mayhem.
But,

590
00:37:01.020 --> 00:37:03.630
so I was thinking like the Machado invitation,

591
00:37:03.631 --> 00:37:06.990
which I think he won that like four or five times.
You have the champion,

592
00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:12.560
the Gracie national,
you won that a bunch of times.
Yeah.

593
00:37:13.260 --> 00:37:16.140
The grapplers quest back in the day.

594
00:37:16.200 --> 00:37:21.090
That's still going to grapplers quest.
The group.
Remember the grappling games?

595
00:37:21.510 --> 00:37:24.030
Remember neutral grounds.
That's,
that's the last one I had.

596
00:37:24.031 --> 00:37:27.740
The last one I had was neutral grounds grounds.
That was in the hood.

597
00:37:28.350 --> 00:37:31.980
It was in the hood in La and the cage,

598
00:37:32.290 --> 00:37:37.080
somebody didn't finish the fence for correctly cut you.
There was,

599
00:37:37.880 --> 00:37:42.880
I mean he was straight teach math like WWF back in deleting in this backyard and

600
00:37:43.741 --> 00:37:46.950
there's like 200 guys who are just like,
uh,

601
00:37:47.370 --> 00:37:50.790
no one's throwing anything but almost,
oh sorry.
Let me start.

602
00:37:50.830 --> 00:37:55.660
I like like environment but not punches that day.
And those required,

603
00:37:55.690 --> 00:37:57.030
Rico's was there.
He is.

604
00:37:57.270 --> 00:38:01.920
I I win against Ricoh Rodriguez.
Yeah,
I lost,

605
00:38:02.460 --> 00:38:06.980
um,
you didn't you go against well,
yeah.

606
00:38:07.340 --> 00:38:12.330
Well let's see though.
I'm a good,
yeah,
I had two matches.
Higgs also,
we both want,

607
00:38:12.360 --> 00:38:17.280
he'd be Hickson's guy.
Yeah,
he was,
he was like a beast.
He was,

608
00:38:17.281 --> 00:38:18.110
he was one of the,

609
00:38:18.110 --> 00:38:21.990
that was an incredible match because he eggs was kind of getting,
you know,

610
00:38:22.030 --> 00:38:24.480
Higgs was a lot smaller than him.
Well maybe in a lot,

611
00:38:24.481 --> 00:38:28.370
but he was 30 or 40 pounds smaller than him.
He has a little bit,
he's,

612
00:38:28.710 --> 00:38:31.410
he's a very confident,

613
00:38:31.411 --> 00:38:35.500
but he's a little more reserved and bows little more physically intimidating

614
00:38:35.530 --> 00:38:38.920
looking is a core guy and exist.

615
00:38:39.760 --> 00:38:43.710
And they went out of,
and then Higgs caught him in a triangle trying to arm lock.

616
00:38:43.820 --> 00:38:47.020
Yeah,
that was nice.
And who,
yeah,
you would,

617
00:38:47.440 --> 00:38:50.800
didn't you have a guy that like wouldn't give up?
Was that you?
Oh No,

618
00:38:50.830 --> 00:38:53.460
that was Carl.
The same guy against Rico,

619
00:38:55.780 --> 00:38:59.290
but not just unconscious where you wake up talking 30 seconds later unconscious

620
00:39:00.280 --> 00:39:04.450
from a grappling match because coach is like,
oh,
he's fine.
He's okay.
He's like,

621
00:39:04.480 --> 00:39:08.110
oh,
he's fine.
And he's like,
he's not in the movie.
And I'm like,

622
00:39:08.170 --> 00:39:11.860
I think I see his chest moving also.
Like he's not dead.
And I'll be like,

623
00:39:11.861 --> 00:39:14.410
are you sure?
He's,
I know he's trying,
he's trying to pick up the guy's like limp.

624
00:39:15.010 --> 00:39:19.170
So tough than top to that head arm.
But match was over heading off frank,

625
00:39:19.180 --> 00:39:21.670
two minutes.
Oh,
they're Armenian guys sandwich.

626
00:39:21.671 --> 00:39:26.470
And that was what we called Rodriguez weighed 300,
300 pounds,
300 pounds.

627
00:39:26.700 --> 00:39:29.890
[inaudible] 71 [inaudible] 70.
My face them,

628
00:39:30.130 --> 00:39:34.480
I got to his back four times and he finally got me the head and arm and 300

629
00:39:34.481 --> 00:39:37.750
pounds.
There's no joke.
He didn't get me in the head and arm.
Uh,

630
00:39:37.840 --> 00:39:40.720
you and I remember you and I on this,

631
00:39:40.930 --> 00:39:45.930
on this like random piece of carpet rolled out and then Allie before the fight

632
00:39:46.181 --> 00:39:47.110
and were,
and you're,

633
00:39:47.140 --> 00:39:49.600
you and me are just drilling because we knew it had an arm was his move.

634
00:39:49.810 --> 00:39:51.040
And so you're just going head Norman.

635
00:39:51.041 --> 00:39:52.960
And I'm getting out of it and getting out of it,
getting out of it.

636
00:39:53.170 --> 00:39:57.850
But he got me in a,
um,
was it Geeky?
Yes it was.

637
00:39:58.180 --> 00:39:59.200
He had spandex,

638
00:40:00.600 --> 00:40:04.930
spandex bottoms and a guitar and he,
uh,
he got me in a,

639
00:40:05.110 --> 00:40:09.160
in an a Zeke,
you'll from my half guard.
Yeah.
Which you don't,

640
00:40:09.670 --> 00:40:12.460
you know the learning phases of Jujitsu and you go,

641
00:40:12.550 --> 00:40:15.640
I didn't know that would work.
That was one of those for me.
I was like,

642
00:40:15.641 --> 00:40:17.560
I didn't know that would work.
I didn't think it would work.

643
00:40:17.561 --> 00:40:22.080
Like you can't put into Zeke,
you all me my half guard and then it work.
Yeah,

644
00:40:22.210 --> 00:40:26.410
we did.
Just just a side tangent,
we're walking to the venue.

645
00:40:26.411 --> 00:40:30.910
We parked two blocks down and Jocko had sunglasses on and there was these two

646
00:40:31.390 --> 00:40:32.560
ghetto dogs.

647
00:40:32.620 --> 00:40:37.240
Like these were pissed off at the or partials and chocolate went like this and

648
00:40:37.241 --> 00:40:42.070
he stared at the August one wrong.
It's funny because I'm like 19 years,

649
00:40:42.180 --> 00:40:44.560
you were probably like 25 and the dogs they were,

650
00:40:44.561 --> 00:40:49.110
they weren't Robert real confident and you came that devil stare and they kind

651
00:40:49.120 --> 00:40:53.380
of backed up.
There were still barking but immediately it was a fence between us.

652
00:40:53.381 --> 00:40:57.680
But first time I seen a man just pumped to dogs with his eyeballs.

653
00:40:58.020 --> 00:41:01.690
It was awesome.
Kind of motivated me.
Fit,
match actually,

654
00:41:01.800 --> 00:41:04.780
you know what was pretty cool?
So this is one of my favorite Dean Lester stories.

655
00:41:05.110 --> 00:41:09.400
You are going against again,
it was one of these crazy tournaments.
Total mayhem.

656
00:41:10.060 --> 00:41:13.750
And so we're talking,
this is like 90 I don't know,

657
00:41:13.810 --> 00:41:17.380
97 98 something like that.
Total mayhem.

658
00:41:17.800 --> 00:41:21.910
And you would always get,
well you'd always be in the finals or the semifinals,

659
00:41:21.940 --> 00:41:24.610
you know,
on your way to the finals because you would win every tournament.

660
00:41:24.611 --> 00:41:29.050
It was freaking ridiculous.
Well not everyone,
but yeah.
Okay.

661
00:41:29.320 --> 00:41:32.810
Not everyone,
but most of all I would do the absolute to it.

662
00:41:32.811 --> 00:41:35.110
So I win my division and the absence.
No,

663
00:41:35.390 --> 00:41:39.170
<v 0>it was awesome.
And I would do my best,
which wouldn't be as good as Dave.</v>

664
00:41:40.930 --> 00:41:42.590
And so when he was deans in this match,

665
00:41:42.650 --> 00:41:46.520
and he's going against this Brazilian kid and they are,

666
00:41:46.730 --> 00:41:49.700
they're going at it and the Brazilian gets real,
super fiery,
right?

667
00:41:49.790 --> 00:41:54.710
Super Five zillion guy slapping and he's going crazy.
And,
and you know,

668
00:41:54.740 --> 00:41:59.600
it's really,
it's,
it's,
it's head touching,
but it's like a head slap.

669
00:41:59.601 --> 00:42:02.480
You can hear the slaps happen and you can see this guy's going all crazy.

670
00:42:03.050 --> 00:42:06.770
And he goes after dean,
like super hard trying to get a takedown.

671
00:42:07.130 --> 00:42:11.720
And they fly across the mat and he's pushing and deans sprawling,
boom.

672
00:42:11.721 --> 00:42:16.670
And they go way out into the stance.
I know I'm,
I'm the side like in his corner.

673
00:42:16.910 --> 00:42:17.810
And so I just see the,

674
00:42:17.811 --> 00:42:22.220
both of them disappear into the crowd and the crowd's going crazy and it gets

675
00:42:22.221 --> 00:42:25.970
quiet and the guy comes out and he's all going crazy.

676
00:42:25.970 --> 00:42:30.290
His all on fire and he's all,
he's like,
come on,
let's go.

677
00:42:30.291 --> 00:42:34.130
And he goes to the middle of a mismatch and get on his knees and starts slamming

678
00:42:34.131 --> 00:42:38.900
the Mat.
Ah,
like he's just so crazy.
And I,
and then I look at,

679
00:42:38.930 --> 00:42:41.420
and then I looked back at the crowd where the hole was,
where they came.

680
00:42:41.870 --> 00:42:45.980
Dean comes walking out and he's looks totally,
completely,
literally.

681
00:42:45.981 --> 00:42:48.860
He looks like the Terminator.
He comes walking out,
no expression on his face.

682
00:42:48.861 --> 00:42:53.600
Comes walking up to the middle of the mat and then the arm lock the guy like 20

683
00:42:53.601 --> 00:42:55.970
seconds later and just the house.

684
00:42:59.930 --> 00:43:04.400
That was pretty awesome.
That was good.
And then,
uh,

685
00:43:05.350 --> 00:43:10.190
in,
in that time period,
right,
is when you do the ADCC trials?

686
00:43:10.580 --> 00:43:15.060
Actually,
we both did.
ADCC Charles in 2003,

687
00:43:16.760 --> 00:43:20.580
<v 2>2002,
I won the,
the trials and then I ended up in Brazil.</v>

688
00:43:21.130 --> 00:43:24.540
I went to all but Dhabi,
I went to up Adobe.
It competed.
I didn't win that year.

689
00:43:25.230 --> 00:43:27.460
I was a purple belt.
We did,
uh,

690
00:43:29.100 --> 00:43:33.160
we did several big trial tournaments,
uh,
Sunday.

691
00:43:33.170 --> 00:43:36.600
It didn't materialize into actual events.
We did several of these saints,

692
00:43:37.270 --> 00:43:39.660
albeit the McCall fires that I think that was the first one.

693
00:43:39.661 --> 00:43:44.250
2001 2002 I think it was 2002.
Yeah.
And it was here in San Diego,
right?
Yeah.

694
00:43:44.310 --> 00:43:46.230
And I've got like Nice Health Club.
Yeah.

695
00:43:46.231 --> 00:43:50.070
The hotel and Kenny Florian was there.
Ah,

696
00:43:50.250 --> 00:43:53.800
Kenny Florian was there and he was super cool.
And uh,
yeah.

697
00:43:54.360 --> 00:43:57.350
And I went against um,

698
00:43:58.200 --> 00:44:00.470
big country related to country.

699
00:44:00.471 --> 00:44:04.320
Matt Nelson and I think it were a division of like four to two or something.

700
00:44:04.350 --> 00:44:07.710
Yeah.
And then you had just wars.

701
00:44:08.010 --> 00:44:11.010
I had this all American wrestler,
I dunno.

702
00:44:11.250 --> 00:44:14.250
Good restaurant that Nate do Charmaine and he slammed my knee.

703
00:44:14.310 --> 00:44:16.560
I found out later that he does it on purpose.

704
00:44:16.680 --> 00:44:20.790
He lets you get the back and he dives and spears and he in the ground and it

705
00:44:20.850 --> 00:44:22.860
damages your knee.
Actually fist choke.

706
00:44:23.640 --> 00:44:26.250
I registered impact or registered like that.
That kind of hurt.

707
00:44:26.550 --> 00:44:29.040
But I didn't let go the truck when he tapped and I was like,

708
00:44:29.220 --> 00:44:32.580
my knee doesn't feel correct and swelled up like this.

709
00:44:32.581 --> 00:44:37.230
Like double the size and I put two epic to knee sleeves over it and I'm like,

710
00:44:37.740 --> 00:44:41.110
I don't know why that's somehow focused me.
I didn't,
I didn't go,
oh,
I'm hurt.

711
00:44:41.920 --> 00:44:45.000
Oh this is my excuse to quit.
I went,
I went,
you know,
it would be really cool.

712
00:44:45.090 --> 00:44:45.740
There's some I did.

713
00:44:45.740 --> 00:44:48.550
Doesn't three psychologically you like being the underdog kind of,
yeah.
Yeah.

714
00:44:48.551 --> 00:44:52.470
Yeah.
I have less pressured.
I think most people would like to be the favorite.

715
00:44:52.530 --> 00:44:54.360
I'd have to be the one that's like,
oh that guy can't win.

716
00:44:54.870 --> 00:44:57.210
And so I had the guy from,
um,

717
00:44:57.840 --> 00:45:02.130
what's his name from Henzel Gracie's from New York and he attacked my leg.

718
00:45:02.520 --> 00:45:06.180
We're going after it and he had me straight in the lock and the reference about

719
00:45:06.181 --> 00:45:09.420
stop.
I looked at record and went like this and he's shaking his legs.

720
00:45:09.510 --> 00:45:13.860
He played my college ball cause we'll athletic Patterson,
Jamal Patterson.

721
00:45:14.710 --> 00:45:17.880
And I got this back,
choked him and I see you in the corner.
Like you're lucky.

722
00:45:18.590 --> 00:45:21.420
This evil grin just shines through the ground.
And I'm like,
yeah.

723
00:45:21.630 --> 00:45:24.690
And then the layman was in the finals and I won by points that one on top of

724
00:45:24.691 --> 00:45:27.840
Dhabi or went to Brazil.
That's also when,

725
00:45:27.960 --> 00:45:32.490
that's also when Eddie Bravo was at the same trials.
He won the trials too.

726
00:45:32.820 --> 00:45:36.030
Yeah.
So that was,
that was kind of a big deal.
And Dave trail one,

727
00:45:36.031 --> 00:45:38.610
his and Dave Tyrrell's when his,
yeah.

728
00:45:38.760 --> 00:45:42.530
And the one who won the heavyweight was in some country.
Boy,
I dunno,

729
00:45:42.540 --> 00:45:47.040
I forget his name.
Yeah.
Once.
So we went down to Brazil and Eddie,

730
00:45:47.190 --> 00:45:50.630
Eddie took third,
but he beat up hoarded ratio.
That was that,

731
00:45:50.750 --> 00:45:54.340
that I got more attention than me winning the absolute yeah.
Ways that was,
well,

732
00:45:54.350 --> 00:45:59.070
they think I'm,
for some reason,
I mean
towards her.
Yeah.
And,

733
00:45:59.580 --> 00:46:04.230
um,
but yeah,
you went and won the absolutes,
which is,
you know,

734
00:46:04.231 --> 00:46:07.740
it's freaking insane that you won the absolute Jocko train me so hard number.

735
00:46:07.741 --> 00:46:10.200
The seven ups on the,
on the stairs shoving ups,

736
00:46:10.360 --> 00:46:12.840
these Danes seven on the cross,

737
00:46:12.841 --> 00:46:16.710
seven ups by seven ups is not like what it sounds like a pop money that's seven

738
00:46:16.711 --> 00:46:21.000
times up the stairs and under what,
20 seconds,
20 seconds you do it again.

739
00:46:21.330 --> 00:46:23.550
And I'm like,
that's my,

740
00:46:24.050 --> 00:46:29.050
my invitation to Jocko Jocko would do this evil navy seal tactic on me where

741
00:46:31.050 --> 00:46:34.810
dean jump up hit the bar and I'm like,
okay,
keep going.
Keep blowing warm too.

742
00:46:35.270 --> 00:46:36.960
I'm like,
when are we gonna stop?
I don't know.

743
00:46:36.990 --> 00:46:40.650
Jocko has some fictitious number in his head.
I have no idea.

744
00:46:41.220 --> 00:46:46.220
But if I slow down it'd be like 99 100 101 I told on 199 and you,

745
00:46:47.910 --> 00:46:50.890
I'm like,
I'm losing my ground.
I can't stop now because I'm going to die.

746
00:46:51.210 --> 00:46:53.640
And the stairs was like,
yeah,
I'll put down seven times.

747
00:46:54.090 --> 00:46:56.380
It wasn't a long stare with maybe three,
but it was like,
Yup,

748
00:46:56.390 --> 00:47:01.390
you up and down in less than 30 seconds or you have to do it x amount of times.

749
00:47:01.411 --> 00:47:04.860
And I got a good shape for that.
Then there was a good teams up in the top floor.

750
00:47:04.861 --> 00:47:07.260
This is when we were at city boxing in downtown San Diego.

751
00:47:07.620 --> 00:47:12.620
There was beams and pipes and like the beams were 14 inches taller than the

752
00:47:13.171 --> 00:47:14.820
pipes up that you had to jumps.

753
00:47:14.821 --> 00:47:19.530
I'd be like on the beam beam beam pipe pipe when he was getting exhausted I'd be

754
00:47:19.531 --> 00:47:22.020
like pipe cause there's a little bit lower.
But yeah,

755
00:47:22.021 --> 00:47:25.640
you were in sec shape and we were just grab that that time.
So uh,

756
00:47:26.370 --> 00:47:29.680
at that time I was going to college.
Yeah.
So I

757
00:47:30.010 --> 00:47:34.230
<v 3>all I had to do,
I wasn't,
I was detached from the seal teams.
Yeah.</v>

758
00:47:34.450 --> 00:47:35.620
From 2003.

759
00:47:35.621 --> 00:47:40.621
And all I was doing was going to college and all we did was train Jujitsu

760
00:47:40.901 --> 00:47:41.650
actually.
Yeah.

761
00:47:41.650 --> 00:47:45.460
And we would just train and just trained more and then just train after that.

762
00:47:45.900 --> 00:47:48.910
Jack was such a maniac.
He's one of the few guys,
I'll say,
hey,

763
00:47:48.970 --> 00:47:49.960
want to trade is six in the morning.

764
00:47:49.961 --> 00:47:54.420
Tomorrow we'll be there at five 30 because we're not,
why be late?
You know,

765
00:47:55.090 --> 00:47:59.470
how about nine 30,
nine o'clock at night?
Yeah,
sure.
Wow.
No,
you'll do it.

766
00:47:59.471 --> 00:48:03.020
No problem.
Jocko helped me cut weight one time.
Remember this?
Uh,

767
00:48:03.670 --> 00:48:06.070
it was funny at one e five for the belt,

768
00:48:06.160 --> 00:48:09.700
it king of the cage and two weeks before the fight,

769
00:48:09.701 --> 00:48:14.170
this is of course a fight now,
uh,
chocolates like dean,

Um,

775
00:48:33.820 --> 00:48:38.010

776

It's,
chuck was like,

779
00:48:51.400 --> 00:48:56.260
I'm like,

Dean,
mother lazy with it.

780
00:48:56.440 --> 00:48:59.530
Get some Epsom salt,

Let me know.
I'm like,
I'm all confident.

781
00:48:59.560 --> 00:49:03.130
I go get Epson salt.
I guess alcohol like rubbed me,
I'll call you,

782
00:49:03.131 --> 00:49:06.700
pour it in the bath.
I don't know,
30 minutes later I get out.

783
00:49:06.870 --> 00:49:11.870
I lost like half a pound and might not 20 half of can I go?

784
00:49:12.940 --> 00:49:17.380
I called Jocko doors.
Like what happened or input or something.
Something,

785
00:49:17.560 --> 00:49:22.240
something,
something military like report.
Yes.
Reconnaissance.
Whatever.

786
00:49:24.700 --> 00:49:29.440
Field report.
So,
so I'm like chocolate.
How much did you lose your mother?

787
00:49:29.530 --> 00:49:33.340
You know,
make,
uh,
uh,
I think I was like three quarters of,
I think I had,

788
00:49:33.800 --> 00:49:36.130
I think I exaggerate.
Three quarters.
Yeah.

789
00:49:36.131 --> 00:49:41.010
It was like your mother maybe at the beach by the house is with both.

790
00:49:41.050 --> 00:49:41.790
How they don't know.

791
00:49:41.790 --> 00:49:46.540
We're all long branch and six in the morning and I go there and John was like,

792
00:49:46.740 --> 00:49:47.573
you know,

793
00:49:47.940 --> 00:49:51.310
the next two weeks you could have like a can of tuna per day and we're going to

794
00:49:51.311 --> 00:49:54.940
run in three hours.
Draka ran it with me,
by the way.
Most people won't do that.
Oh,

795
00:49:54.941 --> 00:49:57.330
I don't watch you run.
You ran me.

796
00:49:57.340 --> 00:50:00.490
We ran all around point Loma in.
By the way,

797
00:50:00.491 --> 00:50:02.620
we're going to the beach and I'm like,
oh,

798
00:50:02.621 --> 00:50:04.960
we're going to run on beach chocolate just over little sea wall.

799
00:50:05.070 --> 00:50:09.430
It's run at the beach,
can kind of close to water and uh,
in the water.
I'm like,

800
00:50:09.431 --> 00:50:12.700
okay.
It's like on the water,
chocolate swimming and these cliffs and I'm,

801
00:50:12.760 --> 00:50:16.590
I'm like,
I'm trying to catch up with them on,
I'm not as seal swim.
Right.
My,

802
00:50:16.600 --> 00:50:20.050
I'm a strong swimmer and I'm not usually like flippers,
flippers.

803
00:50:20.530 --> 00:50:23.170
I thought he did it though.
He's out in the surf going runs cliff.
So I'm like,

804
00:50:23.171 --> 00:50:25.810
okay,
I've done that before,
but he's ahead of me.
I'm like tired.

805
00:50:25.811 --> 00:50:30.480
Like this sucks because I'm already not eating and whatever.
Plus,
uh,

806
00:50:31.280 --> 00:50:32.900
I was younger.
So you know when you're younger,

807
00:50:33.140 --> 00:50:34.730
things suck more than when he older.

808
00:50:34.850 --> 00:50:37.370
You realize it didn't suck that bad because you're older,

809
00:50:37.371 --> 00:50:40.610
you have these experience.
So from a fair run all the way to mission beach,

810
00:50:40.611 --> 00:50:43.610
we're across the bridge.
We sram through that.
Well not a very clean river,

811
00:50:43.611 --> 00:50:45.320
just went through.
But the San Diego River,

812
00:50:45.350 --> 00:50:48.700
we've found through their three hour run,
not every day,

813
00:50:49.380 --> 00:50:52.190
maybe for two weeks all the time.
And I,

814
00:50:52.400 --> 00:50:56.540
I lost 18 pounds and then of course I lost 15 pounds of water and I made the

815
00:50:56.541 --> 00:50:59.360
weight.
That was terrible.
That was harder to cut a,

816
00:50:59.510 --> 00:51:03.740
now it's a hard and I fought a tough guy too.
So yeah,
those anyone,
yeah.

817
00:51:03.770 --> 00:51:05.420
Yeah it was a,
it was a good day.

818
00:51:05.520 --> 00:51:07.260
<v 0>You know what?
I got to go back to the,
uh,</v>

819
00:51:07.440 --> 00:51:11.220
when you won ADCC in Brazil cause that was freaking amazing.

820
00:51:12.020 --> 00:51:13.680
So there's a couple things.
Number one,

821
00:51:13.740 --> 00:51:18.030
one of the guys that you faced was a guy named,
paid upon.
Oh yeah.
And,

822
00:51:18.060 --> 00:51:22.380
and I was reading so I couldn't go down cause I was in college at the time.

823
00:51:22.381 --> 00:51:24.450
And it was right in final exams.
I couldn't,

824
00:51:24.510 --> 00:51:26.520
I literally could not go down with you.

825
00:51:26.910 --> 00:51:31.910
And so you were down there by yourself in Brazil in enemy territory and you're

826
00:51:33.031 --> 00:51:37.440
down there.
And so I'm reading,
there's something called the,
it's the underground,

827
00:51:37.620 --> 00:51:40.530
it's the,
it's the m is the mixed martial arts.com.

828
00:51:40.800 --> 00:51:45.180
It's the Ugi which also has the Oji.
So it's,
it's an old forum,

829
00:51:45.181 --> 00:51:47.730
which still exists to this day.
It used to be called submission fighting.

830
00:51:47.731 --> 00:51:51.810
And actually you and I,
when I was on deployment like way back then,

831
00:51:52.200 --> 00:51:54.750
you and I would communicate,
we didn't have email,

832
00:51:54.810 --> 00:51:57.210
so I would communicate on submission,

833
00:51:57.211 --> 00:52:02.160
fighting.com and the threads and the struggle.
Yeah.
Yeah.

834
00:52:02.580 --> 00:52:04.260
And uh,
so I'm reading,

835
00:52:04.261 --> 00:52:09.210
so what they're doing is someone is translating like an some kind of automatic

836
00:52:09.211 --> 00:52:11.970
termination,
watching them posting what it's saying.

837
00:52:12.810 --> 00:52:16.440
And so it was like a literal,
the Americans in trouble.
Yeah,
no,
it was a literal,

838
00:52:16.441 --> 00:52:20.190
it was a literal translation and so paid upon,
oh,
means cloth foot,
is that right?

839
00:52:20.430 --> 00:52:23.730
Yeah,
but it's actually,
it's a car clunkier care something.
Yeah.
Well,

840
00:52:23.731 --> 00:52:27.930
this guy paid upon him was a guy that our instructor,
Fabio,
he's unbeatable.

841
00:52:28.050 --> 00:52:32.260
He paid upon was this massive guy and he was sick black belt in Jujitsu.

842
00:52:32.280 --> 00:52:32.851
And he's like,
yeah,

843
00:52:32.851 --> 00:52:36.010
this guy will never be beaten because he's so massive and he's so good at

844
00:52:36.011 --> 00:52:38.970
Jujitsu.
No one could score points on him.
Usually he was just a dominator.

845
00:52:39.090 --> 00:52:42.060
And how has anyone are going to be something that's that big and that skilled.

846
00:52:42.510 --> 00:52:44.040
And so dean,
so I'm reading,

847
00:52:44.041 --> 00:52:48.210
I remember I'm sitting in the parking lot of home depot for some reason and the

848
00:52:48.211 --> 00:52:49.980
match is going on and I'm reading,

849
00:52:49.981 --> 00:52:54.981
I'm refreshing it on my phone and it's popping up and it's slow.

850
00:52:55.920 --> 00:52:59.730
It's like back in the day,
right?
Reception's bad.

851
00:53:00.480 --> 00:53:02.310
And I'm reading it in it.
And I remember this thing,

852
00:53:02.311 --> 00:53:07.140
it says that it says the cloth foot has a choke in deep.

853
00:53:08.190 --> 00:53:12.840
The American must have a tube to his lungs because he is not tapping.

854
00:53:13.250 --> 00:53:14.190
And I was like,
yes.

855
00:53:15.100 --> 00:53:19.890
And then you beat him and a man you beat and then you went on a one that was a,

856
00:53:19.891 --> 00:53:22.220
that was a big deal,
man.
Yeah,
he beat,

857
00:53:22.370 --> 00:53:27.330
<v 3>I mean,
he beat a bedroom that day and then well in their own division and uh,</v>

858
00:53:27.360 --> 00:53:30.840
but he cheated in that match.
Oh,
by the way,
pit upon was the only guy,

859
00:53:30.841 --> 00:53:33.270
he wouldn't shake my hand.
You not talking to smack.

860
00:53:33.271 --> 00:53:36.180
He just wasn't a very gracious,
uh,
you know,
by the way,

861
00:53:36.181 --> 00:53:38.570
you can tell a lot about a person,
how,

862
00:53:38.571 --> 00:53:42.510
how they conduct themselves when they win and all Saudi Lewis.
So by the way,

863
00:53:42.600 --> 00:53:45.000
he was smashing me when the points didn't count.
My buddy,

864
00:53:45.001 --> 00:53:49.820
he was 40 pounds heavier than he said,
big guy,
six foot six,
six foot,
seven foot,

865
00:53:49.830 --> 00:53:54.780
six,
260,
70 pounds.
And uh,

866
00:53:54.870 --> 00:53:59.190
but he,
he,
uh,
he,
he won against very to him,
but he cheated.

867
00:53:59.580 --> 00:54:02.110
I saw the tape and he put his arm on.
Uh,

868
00:54:02.430 --> 00:54:06.720
it wasn't a submission out of balance each.
He did,
whenever we started the crowd,

869
00:54:06.721 --> 00:54:10.230
the crowd was ingredient,
a submission about,
he was in trouble.
He wasn't,

870
00:54:10.980 --> 00:54:13.770
he was on the verge of it being locked in,
but he kind of moved his arms.

871
00:54:13.771 --> 00:54:16.230
So He wa he started in a more favorable position.

872
00:54:16.290 --> 00:54:19.110
So that was the one match where the Brazilians were kind of cheering for me.

873
00:54:19.410 --> 00:54:21.450
Otherwise,
no,
they're caring for the other Brazilians,

874
00:54:21.451 --> 00:54:26.020
but so when I wanted to people,
so who was the first match against?

875
00:54:26.040 --> 00:54:28.760
What's match was Nate Marquardt Neymar court and I got to get in my Camaro.

876
00:54:28.830 --> 00:54:32.830
Tough guy.
Yeah.
Awesome.
God that was brutal.
Yeah.
Sallow here.

877
00:54:32.831 --> 00:54:36.330
Barrel and then Solo and the salad was already at five time world champion at

878
00:54:36.331 --> 00:54:40.610
the time I was a brown belt,
so it was kind of,
for me,
it was weird.
I,

879
00:54:41.130 --> 00:54:44.340
I had less pressure in the harder division,
uh,

880
00:54:45.990 --> 00:54:50.360
where I was.
Last guy was number 16 of the world.
Um,

881
00:54:51.300 --> 00:54:54.840
it was,
I dunno why he just will you like I said,
you like to be the underdog.

882
00:54:54.960 --> 00:54:56.280
Yeah.
I don't know.
I don't,

883
00:54:56.340 --> 00:55:00.090
I wish I could describe what happened that day because if I could replicate
that,

884
00:55:00.630 --> 00:55:02.520
I don't know what happened.
Eric Paulson said,

885
00:55:03.360 --> 00:55:06.390
he said Dean had a golden aura around and I saw it.

886
00:55:08.040 --> 00:55:10.650
I don't see auras yet,
but I'm working there one day.

887
00:55:10.651 --> 00:55:15.050
I want to see you like that gift.
And so these guys,
I mean sallows like,

888
00:55:15.390 --> 00:55:16.460
like you said,
five times more.

889
00:55:16.470 --> 00:55:19.920
I mean he's just one of the best in his boss's brothers,
Raji and John History,

890
00:55:19.921 --> 00:55:22.920
both awesome,
unbelievable Jujitsu players.
And then you,

891
00:55:22.980 --> 00:55:24.330
and then it was paid upon him.

892
00:55:25.170 --> 00:55:29.660
And then in the finals it was cockeyed eight who was cockeyed Eiko at a handy

893
00:55:29.680 --> 00:55:34.410
for Hara.
And He,
uh,
he's a beast.
He,
he's known for,

894
00:55:35.100 --> 00:55:37.420
he actually was a good sport,
but he,
he,

895
00:55:37.440 --> 00:55:41.040
he had the reputation that Tokyo has today.
He would hurt people actually.

896
00:55:41.040 --> 00:55:41.580
Footlocker,

897
00:55:41.580 --> 00:55:45.930
John G that day he guilty and completed that day and he beat for abusive or do

898
00:55:45.940 --> 00:55:47.490
them also just by Quincy at the same guy,

899
00:55:47.790 --> 00:55:51.100
eight zero five zero and then fiber sub be paid upon.
Oh,

900
00:55:51.101 --> 00:55:55.350
and that third fourth match.
So that was Kinda like,
uh,
you know,

901
00:55:55.600 --> 00:55:59.850
this is payback here,
you know,
so he went,
so it was a good day.
And the finals,

902
00:56:00.030 --> 00:56:03.360
I was told this guy has the best gilts in the world and the best foot locks in

903
00:56:03.361 --> 00:56:06.120
Brazil for sure.
And he's the best wrestler in Brazil.
So I'm like,

904
00:56:06.150 --> 00:56:10.500
I thought about it like,
who is,
Oh,
be careful as guilty.
And I thought to myself,

905
00:56:10.740 --> 00:56:14.790
I'm not trying to act courageous,
nothing like that,
but I said to myself,

906
00:56:14.910 --> 00:56:17.280
that would really suck.
And I go,
I kind of,

907
00:56:17.340 --> 00:56:19.080
maybe you could feel how is guilty and his,
you know,

908
00:56:19.110 --> 00:56:22.020
and so I grabbed his legs and he went for,
and I was like,
let me see how it is.

909
00:56:23.590 --> 00:56:26.200
Not that I wanted it.
Yeah.
Kind of.
I wanted to escape it.

910
00:56:26.350 --> 00:56:29.380
It's kind of weird anyway,
and to play with the fire and it wasn't,
yeah,

911
00:56:29.430 --> 00:56:30.670
that was in it.
And he really,
I hear,

912
00:56:30.700 --> 00:56:33.430
I hear the crowd yelling and I hear the crowd gets silent because he has me so

913
00:56:33.431 --> 00:56:37.650
tight,
not where my ears,
but I'm getting choked really somehow.
I'm,

914
00:56:37.780 --> 00:56:42.030
I guess I'm slightly resistant to submissions.
I heard.
And um,
and I,

915
00:56:42.480 --> 00:56:45.780
I'm just thinking like I could see the light at the tunnel and uh,

916
00:56:46.320 --> 00:56:50.210
as he started getting a little tired and as soon as elbow on his could,

917
00:56:50.670 --> 00:56:55.190
technically that was the reason,
but I maybe just resistant,
echo something.

918
00:56:55.450 --> 00:56:59.380
Um,
so he eventually got tired,
let go,
and I saw his eyes.
He was just,
I got him,

919
00:56:59.470 --> 00:57:00.340
I knew at that moment.

920
00:57:00.580 --> 00:57:03.010
And then we started in the middle and I went for a full lock and he was real

921
00:57:03.011 --> 00:57:06.820
calm for luck and that 50,
50,
we didn't call it 50,
50.

922
00:57:06.820 --> 00:57:10.660
Then I said let's try it.
And I did it and his eyes,

923
00:57:10.661 --> 00:57:14.260
you could see he doesn't know what's coming function and he would iie tap,

924
00:57:14.261 --> 00:57:17.590
well more of a macho.
I,
I got him.

925
00:57:17.920 --> 00:57:22.050
And then of course I actually couldn't believe it at the moment because I would

926
00:57:22.051 --> 00:57:22.884
probably use,

927
00:57:23.620 --> 00:57:27.190
well it's the equivalent of the Olympics for our sport and it's the,

928
00:57:27.540 --> 00:57:31.980
there are Olympic wrestling in Abu Dhabi.
There's sambal geysers only judo guys.

929
00:57:32.030 --> 00:57:36.670
Best Jiu Jitsu guys are in this and a whole world's invited and the winner gets

930
00:57:36.940 --> 00:57:37.960
40 g's baby.

931
00:57:38.080 --> 00:57:42.610
So there's no other tournament that pays how much I was 27.

932
00:57:44.470 --> 00:57:49.270
That was a lot of money man.
Your legs a on yeah.
Yeah,
it is easy.
Yeah.
And uh,

933
00:57:49.820 --> 00:57:54.010
it was funny.
Uh,
so I'm,
I'm number 16,

934
00:57:54.011 --> 00:57:57.100
but I have no co Margarita came down the coach saying you're number 16,

935
00:57:57.101 --> 00:57:59.560
you were in the number six toes seed.
Yeah,
exactly.

936
00:57:59.740 --> 00:58:01.840
And that's how you ended up being one.

937
00:58:01.870 --> 00:58:06.870
But so I'm worried I have no coach until Margaret came down for the last three

938
00:58:07.031 --> 00:58:10.720
matches.
I'm shadow boxing.
I have no,
everyone's wrestling with the coach.

939
00:58:10.721 --> 00:58:13.180
I'm just like shadowbox I'm like a Weirdo.
I by the way,

940
00:58:14.130 --> 00:58:15.430
I didn't think I was going to be in the tournament,

941
00:58:15.431 --> 00:58:19.180
so I wore my Bridgeland entitys cause I don't usually fight or compete in those.

942
00:58:19.330 --> 00:58:22.480
I use the word sip trunks,
but I'm like God,
in case I'm invited,

943
00:58:22.750 --> 00:58:24.550
I'll put my sweatpants over you.

944
00:58:24.551 --> 00:58:28.820
So I'm in like basically speedos warm me up shadowboxing,

945
00:58:28.920 --> 00:58:29.561
all want yourself.

946
00:58:29.561 --> 00:58:33.630
And I look up and there's just only Brazilian girls looking down at me.
Like,

947
00:58:33.640 --> 00:58:36.910
and I'm like going down and one girl goes,
hey,
come here in that,

948
00:58:37.270 --> 00:58:38.380
I shouldn't have done it.
But you know,

949
00:58:39.370 --> 00:58:43.660
this girl could have been on lung on the cover of a magazine and
she said,
hey,

950
00:58:46.060 --> 00:58:49.750
how you doing?
Portuguese was not that good back then.
I was like,
oh,

951
00:58:51.480 --> 00:58:55.450
I'm good.
How are you?
And she said in Portuguese,
Oh,
you're not resilient,

952
00:58:55.451 --> 00:58:58.470
how are you?
And I said,
no.
And she went and she turned her back and walk.

953
00:58:58.530 --> 00:59:02.680
She called me over and then turn the ways jacked up.
So I'm like,
all right,

954
00:59:02.700 --> 00:59:07.570
mister chops up,
focus,
focus.
And then I got through this.
And then at this moment,

955
00:59:07.571 --> 00:59:12.040
I don't know why this is,
but the champion gets like 95% of the attention.

956
00:59:12.041 --> 00:59:14.770
The Guy who took second is equal level of me.

957
00:59:14.980 --> 00:59:16.750
Maybe it could be me a different day.
I must admit,

958
00:59:16.751 --> 00:59:18.940
I'm not gonna say it can never lose to that guy.
He's really good.

959
00:59:19.870 --> 00:59:21.500
But I have align

960
00:59:21.980 --> 00:59:25.400
<v 2>a thousand people waiting to meet me and take pictures with me.
So I'm in the,</v>

961
00:59:25.410 --> 00:59:29.810
I'm still on my Brisbane's tidy.
So you know,
and uh,
I'm glad you guys like,
Hey,

962
00:59:29.811 --> 00:59:33.290
what's up?
Hey girls.
Hey kids.
You know,
I can picture it.

963
00:59:33.530 --> 00:59:37.550
And after half hour I see this girl,
like eight people don't go on like,
hi,

964
00:59:37.790 --> 00:59:41.870

Hi.
And I'm like,
I'm like mental note.
Like so sh she waits.

965
00:59:41.871 --> 00:59:45.250
She waited like an hour to meet me and she finally within earshot,

966
00:59:45.260 --> 00:59:48.990
she's like in Portuguese murmur me.
Hey,
I knew you could do it.
She's Spanish,

967
00:59:49.070 --> 00:59:50.240
Portuguese.
And I'm like,
yeah,
whatever.

968
00:59:50.390 --> 00:59:55.390
She gets up to me and I'm sure I was guy would've would've caved in to this.

969
00:59:55.910 --> 01:00:00.190
But I,
I skipped her just like that.
And uh,
she had this little puppy dog look,

970
01:00:00.200 --> 01:00:04.550
this hurt ice on it.
That was like,
you either try Jan moral victory of that game.

971
01:00:04.630 --> 01:00:08.780
It was awesome.
So the walk when,
when you were doing that,

972
01:00:08.781 --> 01:00:12.650
I remember in when you getting ready for that,
first of all,

973
01:00:12.651 --> 01:00:15.380
we trained freaking hard like crazy.

974
01:00:15.650 --> 01:00:20.060
And I remember sarge since to push you hard as hard as we possibly could.

975
01:00:20.061 --> 01:00:22.410
Like sarge cause starts a better wrestler than me.

976
01:00:22.610 --> 01:00:25.880
He would do the take downs with you and then as soon as you guys would hit the

977
01:00:25.881 --> 01:00:29.050
mat,
I would jump on top and that way and get,

978
01:00:29.060 --> 01:00:30.920
get you just as tired as we get you.

979
01:00:31.130 --> 01:00:35.870
But also I didn't think about it this way,
but man,

980
01:00:35.871 --> 01:00:37.940
a lot of times when you and I would be training,

981
01:00:38.420 --> 01:00:41.420
like we would just sit there and try and foot lock each other for just a half an

982
01:00:41.420 --> 01:00:42.770
hour.
I mean it would be like it's,

983
01:00:42.920 --> 01:00:46.730
which is weird because now that's very common to see in one was really doing

984
01:00:46.731 --> 01:00:47.564
that actually.
Yeah,

985
01:00:47.570 --> 01:00:50.540
no one was doing it back then and now you see tournaments and that's what the

986
01:00:50.541 --> 01:00:51.470
tournament is.

987
01:00:51.500 --> 01:00:54.610
It's just a bunch of people trying to foot lock each other and l sit there,

988
01:00:54.650 --> 01:00:58.340
he will hook for luck and when,
when we were doing it,

989
01:00:58.760 --> 01:01:03.260
that's why like when I look back on,
I was like no one was doing that.

990
01:01:03.290 --> 01:01:08.060
You would never see anyone sit there and trade foot locks and heal hooks for 20

991
01:01:08.061 --> 01:01:11.570
minutes as we're,
we're actually rolling trying to submit each other,

992
01:01:11.571 --> 01:01:13.730
but we're just trading and trading and trading.

993
01:01:14.060 --> 01:01:18.530
And that gave you such an advantage when,
you know,
you knew moves,

994
01:01:18.590 --> 01:01:22.910
you had techniques that were just no one even understood the position.

995
01:01:22.911 --> 01:01:26.890
And now you hear a John Danaher talking about it,
you know,

996
01:01:26.930 --> 01:01:30.620
and I heard John Donahoe her talking about the fact that,
you know,

997
01:01:30.621 --> 01:01:34.790
he teaches his guys to get people in a position that the other person isn't

998
01:01:34.791 --> 01:01:36.130
comfortable with.
Right?
And that's,

999
01:01:36.320 --> 01:01:40.640
that's what you were doing weight way back then was,
hey,

1000
01:01:40.641 --> 01:01:43.580
I'm going to take you to somewhere that you do not understand what's happening

1001
01:01:43.581 --> 01:01:47.960
and you will be confused and I'm going to crush you.
And on top of that,
you know,

1002
01:01:47.961 --> 01:01:51.830
your natural,
like I said,
a mutant skills and all that.

1003
01:01:52.130 --> 01:01:53.600
And it just turns into a while.

1004
01:01:53.601 --> 01:01:56.570
I guess it turns into world championship is when it turns into that was a good

1005
01:01:56.570 --> 01:01:58.760
day,
you know,
you know,
uh,
the,

1006
01:01:59.180 --> 01:02:02.780
it became what I won with the 50,
50.
I didn't,

1007
01:02:02.900 --> 01:02:05.150
I didn't have a name for that position.
I,

1008
01:02:05.620 --> 01:02:10.620
I was reading Portuguese from some respectable older guy who's homeless,

1009
01:02:10.731 --> 01:02:15.590
their names.
But people I looked up to were saying,
basically,
this is a disaster.

1010
01:02:15.591 --> 01:02:18.560
This green Goo Griego means foreigner.
It's not a slur,

1011
01:02:18.561 --> 01:02:22.380
just means 400 Zam foreigners coming down here.
This is not Jujitsu.

1012
01:02:22.560 --> 01:02:26.970
What the hell repeated by different people.
And I'm like,
okay,
well,
you know,

1013
01:02:26.971 --> 01:02:30.060
I looked at my gold medal in my trophy and I'm like,

1014
01:02:30.061 --> 01:02:31.170
I don't feel so bad actually.

1015
01:02:32.090 --> 01:02:37.090
But that three months later I hear about a position called the 50 50 I'm like,

1016
01:02:37.231 --> 01:02:41.310
I want to see it and I'll go,
oh,
now it's accepted.
It's a Brazilian move now.

1017
01:02:41.360 --> 01:02:45.660
Yeah.
Also won the move.
I got a solid one.
No one was doing that knee lock now.

1018
01:02:45.900 --> 01:02:48.210
Now it's commonplace.
A Crowbar,

1019
01:02:48.300 --> 01:02:52.050
I forget if it was you or me that came up with the idea,
but you for sure Kim,

1020
01:02:52.100 --> 01:02:52.933
the name Crowbar.

1021
01:02:52.950 --> 01:02:57.330
I heard in Russia the a crowbar and they're doing cobra with a cage.
I'm like,

1022
01:02:57.331 --> 01:03:01.740
man,
that's been around.
So like the man,
all these kinds of things.

1023
01:03:02.040 --> 01:03:05.910
Um,
you know what?
Maybe someone's done it before me,

1024
01:03:06.090 --> 01:03:10.770
but you brought it a legit actual military gas mask on their treadmill or like

1025
01:03:10.771 --> 01:03:12.420
do you put it on like what the hell?
I just,

1026
01:03:12.640 --> 01:03:15.240
I looked like late from a damn horror movie like Montreal.

1027
01:03:16.080 --> 01:03:19.150
And so now everyone's worn gas,
Mac dream mass.

1028
01:03:19.151 --> 01:03:23.670
When did these aren't real gas man,
this is actual,
I'm running.

1029
01:03:23.860 --> 01:03:28.320
I was like,
if you're slow down,
we're adding another 20 minutes.
Okay.
I did it.

1030
01:03:28.321 --> 01:03:31.940
I didn't complain.
But yeah,
we were like doing stuff before most people.
It was,

1031
01:03:31.941 --> 01:03:35.970
it was good times.
That was pretty awesome.
And also at this whole time period,

1032
01:03:36.030 --> 01:03:40.740
you were also fighting MMA and you were king of the cage.

1033
01:03:41.390 --> 01:03:42.810
You fought a bunch of fights and king of the cage,

1034
01:03:42.811 --> 01:03:45.870
you were in the middle weight champion and King of the cage pretty.

1035
01:03:46.110 --> 01:03:49.260
And then that's when King of the cage was sort of the feet or organization for

1036
01:03:49.261 --> 01:03:52.200
pride,
which was when pride was,

1037
01:03:52.830 --> 01:03:57.660
the equivalent was number one UFC until everyone in the world,

1038
01:03:57.990 --> 01:04:01.500
you know,
it was,
it was very,
very popular.
The fights were awesome.

1039
01:04:01.501 --> 01:04:03.810
They had the best fighters.
Um,

1040
01:04:04.260 --> 01:04:06.030
well I can't say they had the best fighters because they had,

1041
01:04:06.060 --> 01:04:08.700
they had equivalent fighters of,

1042
01:04:08.880 --> 01:04:12.900
I think they were one notch at that time.
I think there were one notch above you,

1043
01:04:12.901 --> 01:04:13.411
some of them.

1044
01:04:13.411 --> 01:04:18.040
But some of them came to the UFC and didn't do as well as well as with the pride

1045
01:04:18.180 --> 01:04:21.720
and it work both ways at different rules.
Say it's equivalent,

1046
01:04:21.721 --> 01:04:23.430
I won't say it's better,
but it was definitely,

1047
01:04:23.490 --> 01:04:26.680
it was definitely so you were in the feed or organization for pride and then,

1048
01:04:26.760 --> 01:04:28.890
and then you went to private,
but he had the cage was third.

1049
01:04:28.940 --> 01:04:31.320
It was considered the third hardest in the world.
Yeah,
it was.

1050
01:04:31.600 --> 01:04:32.610
Well I don't even think,
yeah,

1051
01:04:32.611 --> 01:04:35.060
Al underneath that was just completely unknown things.

1052
01:04:35.580 --> 01:04:37.950
And you and I got lucky because uh,

1053
01:04:38.310 --> 01:04:42.480
well I got lucky because I was hanging out with you and we would go to Japan and

1054
01:04:42.481 --> 01:04:46.300
we saw some pretty,
pretty crazy fights in Japan too.

1055
01:04:47.030 --> 01:04:49.470
My goodness.
The stories we have,
remember that,

1056
01:04:49.471 --> 01:04:53.730
remember that time we were his pool hall?
Like it's late night,

1057
01:04:54.750 --> 01:04:56.610
one 30,
and I dunno,
whatever it was benign.

1058
01:04:56.630 --> 01:05:00.990
Maybe we're playing pool and there's this a VIP area.

1059
01:05:01.290 --> 01:05:06.290
It's actual a pool lounge and there's a big Japanese bodyguard there.

1060
01:05:07.080 --> 01:05:10.050
What's beyond our music and stuff?
And they just try to get in there.
He's like,

1061
01:05:10.051 --> 01:05:12.660
he's like,
like,
I guess that means no,

1062
01:05:12.690 --> 01:05:15.960
you can't come in and we're just Harrington hoists.

1063
01:05:16.140 --> 01:05:18.040
That's when that's when he lost to your

1064
01:05:18.040 --> 01:05:22.630
<v 3>sheet.
Oh yeah.
He's come by with a bunch of,
um,
let's say connected Japanese,</v>

1065
01:05:23.130 --> 01:05:25.210
uh,
friends and he sees us.
He goes,
hey,

1066
01:05:25.240 --> 01:05:29.560
dean shotgun and gets his in there and it's,
it's like a Karaoke lounge.

1067
01:05:29.590 --> 01:05:32.500
And it was Lionel Richie's a voice coach

1068
01:05:32.710 --> 01:05:36.700
<v 0>was singing there.
It was just nuts.</v>

1069
01:05:37.330 --> 01:05:41.460
And,
um,
dude,
I met Lionel Richie's voice building.
What's out,

1070
01:05:42.790 --> 01:05:45.300
what's the time that we saw?

1071
01:05:45.430 --> 01:05:50.350
So seeing those big fights in Japan and when we saw no gira fight,
Bob Sapp,

1072
01:05:50.410 --> 01:05:54.910
so no bureau was no gears to 100 or 230 pounds,
maybe 200,

1073
01:05:54.911 --> 01:05:57.280
350.
Yeah.
Bob Sapp 350 pounds.

1074
01:05:57.281 --> 01:06:02.281
He beat the living crap out of no Gira for however long.

1075
01:06:04.450 --> 01:06:07.630
Seven minutes.
Yeah.
And then no gear.
Got Him in an arm lock.

1076
01:06:07.780 --> 01:06:11.020
Omoplata sweep arm locked.
That was clear.
The army,

1077
01:06:11.200 --> 01:06:14.350
it wasn't the national stadium.
There's like 120,000 people on the crowd.

1078
01:06:14.351 --> 01:06:16.720
They had kettle drums.
Do you know what those are?
Echo,

1079
01:06:16.780 --> 01:06:18.010
you know what a kettle drum is?

1080
01:06:18.580 --> 01:06:23.580
Just big giant drums and then ways that troop of Japanese drum players.

1081
01:06:24.160 --> 01:06:25.210
So when this thing kicked off,

1082
01:06:25.211 --> 01:06:29.020
these guys are surrounding the top of the stadium with kettle drums,
Doo,
Doo,

1083
01:06:29.021 --> 01:06:30.430
Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo,
Doo Doo.

1084
01:06:30.730 --> 01:06:35.050
It was on fire and dean and I were there,
you know,
and we flew,

1085
01:06:35.051 --> 01:06:38.830
actually flew over with,
with voice for those things and them was there I think.

1086
01:06:38.860 --> 01:06:40.350
Yeah,
that's right man.
It was just,

1087
01:06:40.660 --> 01:06:43.870
I think Bergen was in the walkout entourage or something.
You know,

1088
01:06:43.871 --> 01:06:48.050
he was somewhere else.
But it's guys or parachuting in like remember that?

1089
01:06:48.250 --> 01:06:51.860
Oh yeah,
I would say in is,
yeah.
He's like,
he has a camera,

1090
01:06:51.861 --> 01:06:55.290
it's like [inaudible] at 20,000 feet and he's like,
I'm falling.
And it was like,

1091
01:06:55.500 --> 01:06:58.180
and they come down and they landed like in the ring.

1092
01:06:58.250 --> 01:07:01.660
It was procurious he was crazy.
And then you ended up for,
you know,

1093
01:07:01.690 --> 01:07:03.250
obviously since you were the king of the cage champion,

1094
01:07:03.251 --> 01:07:07.210
you ended up going to pride,
you got sick fights and pride.
You fought,
uh,

1095
01:07:07.660 --> 01:07:09.970
will you beat so g yeah.
And he was uh,

1096
01:07:10.060 --> 01:07:14.350
he was like a warrior and then you got a beast of a fight against a Rona.

1097
01:07:14.710 --> 01:07:15.610
I also face to,

1098
01:07:16.540 --> 01:07:20.780
<v 3>oh,
and then I,
I,
well I didn't get to fight Paula Philo,
he,</v>

1099
01:07:20.870 --> 01:07:25.220
because he got his,
um,
you guys lake broken.
Um,
but I also fought job.

1100
01:07:25.700 --> 01:07:26.840
I'm also,
they're from Russia.

1101
01:07:27.090 --> 01:07:29.360
Sounds like some of these things sound like I'm making them up.

1102
01:07:29.361 --> 01:07:34.280
But he legitimately became a hit man for the Russian something.
The syndicate.

1103
01:07:34.700 --> 01:07:39.350
Russia killed a couple politicians and the arrested him because apparently you

1104
01:07:39.351 --> 01:07:41.960
can't do that.
And does,

1105
01:07:42.020 --> 01:07:45.740
he confirmed he died in prison of cancer.
And in Russia,

1106
01:07:45.741 --> 01:07:47.360
if you kill a few politicians,
they just go,

1107
01:07:47.660 --> 01:07:51.020
we're not going to take care of your cancer too much.
He did that right away.

1108
01:07:51.021 --> 01:07:53.000
He died.
I died like two years ago.
So He's in prison.

1109
01:07:53.150 --> 01:07:56.420
That guy you've seen him before.
His nose was just probably broken.

1110
01:07:56.630 --> 01:08:01.040
That guy became a hit man.
And so I fought that guy and uh,
I Rona was,

1111
01:08:01.070 --> 01:08:05.120
that was our match.
That wasn't,
I'll take ownership of this situation.
I'm not,

1112
01:08:05.150 --> 01:08:08.840
I'm not making excuses,
but explanation wise it was not,

1113
01:08:09.770 --> 01:08:14.210
I was not my normal self for that fight,
but it was our fight.

1114
01:08:14.300 --> 01:08:16.040
I lost my decision.
It was good.
It was good.

1115
01:08:16.040 --> 01:08:18.160
<v 2>It was 100,000 people in the crowd was awesome.</v>

1116
01:08:18.200 --> 01:08:22.880
That was you walked down Z and Shandy?
Yeah.
Go.
Yeah,
my friend Tim.

1117
01:08:23.080 --> 01:08:24.830
All right.
Tim Comas,
Tim,

1118
01:08:27.340 --> 01:08:32.270
Tim Comas now.
Oh yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
Back then it was,
yeah.
Yeah,
he uh,

1119
01:08:32.570 --> 01:08:37.400
he me,
I walked into one of the songs
and Hans was there.

1120
01:08:37.401 --> 01:08:41.150
It was good.
It was good times till Brent who was there and then,

1121
01:08:42.200 --> 01:08:44.990
and then eventually you get picked up by UFC.

1122
01:08:45.320 --> 01:08:49.340
So I transferred it the right time.
2005 six I just transferred.

1123
01:08:49.730 --> 01:08:53.030
It was a perfect time to transfer actually.
They had some good scraps.

1124
01:08:53.031 --> 01:08:56.560
I was actually going overseas now cause I was backwards team for awhile.

1125
01:08:56.660 --> 01:08:58.900
So I was kind of out of the,
uh,

1126
01:09:00.080 --> 01:09:03.110
out of the fight game for a little bit.
It was still training.
Yeah.

1127
01:09:03.130 --> 01:09:04.670
Training when I was with you.
But um,

1128
01:09:05.360 --> 01:09:10.300
you had a bunch of fights in UFC by the way.
Make sure that I,

1129
01:09:10.301 --> 01:09:13.430
I don't forget to tell the kill Jocko story.
I've got to tell that story later,

1130
01:09:13.431 --> 01:09:18.020
but we'll just tell her right now.
Well,
I'll see it but,
but um,
okay.

1131
01:09:18.350 --> 01:09:21.200
So I was not,
I mean there wasn't pride at the time.

1132
01:09:22.080 --> 01:09:25.410
Jocko went to Afghanistan.
You were somewhere.
I think it was good.

1133
01:09:25.411 --> 01:09:28.730
I think it was my first deployment to Iraq for a couple of months and then it

1134
01:09:28.731 --> 01:09:31.490
was maybe I was just doing it.
Maybe if we,
I'm not sure.

1135
01:09:31.640 --> 01:09:36.640
But you were gone and you come back and my mom had this medication,

1136
01:09:38.301 --> 01:09:42.560
I had acne and it was some kind of antibiotic helped it,

1137
01:09:42.561 --> 01:09:47.300
but I didn't know.
It made me really weak and uh,
took my endurance away.

1138
01:09:47.570 --> 01:09:52.170
This is actually true.
This is not an excuse to this
chocolate comes back and I'm,

1139
01:09:52.250 --> 01:09:54.230
I'm not really feeling like a trunk was.
I was trained on Michael.
Okay.

1140
01:09:54.650 --> 01:09:57.920
And Jog would that kicks my ass and chocolates.
Like literally he's angry.

1141
01:09:57.921 --> 01:10:02.100
He's like,
you lazy more than I'm in the desert.
I'm doing this and you,

1142
01:10:02.720 --> 01:10:05.180
you're sitting on your ass here and sandy will do nothing and I kicked your ass

1143
01:10:05.181 --> 01:10:06.870
in w and I'm like,
Eh,
I'm just like,

1144
01:10:07.760 --> 01:10:11.870
I'm not ashamed of myself cause cause and then you go away for like a month or

1145
01:10:11.880 --> 01:10:13.700
somewhere you're gone.
And I'm like,

1146
01:10:14.480 --> 01:10:17.300
but that medication were at 10 days and I stopped taking it.
I feel strong again.

1147
01:10:17.420 --> 01:10:20.600
I'm like,
oh I understand now.
So I'm training.
I'm like,
mother,

1148
01:10:20.620 --> 01:10:23.840
when the kid comes back,
I can't wait for this.
I made a CD

1149
01:10:25.840 --> 01:10:29.570
kill Jocko was had like corn and Metallica all he was like,

1150
01:10:29.810 --> 01:10:33.180
and so John came and I'm like,
Hey Jocko.
And I put this in and we trained in,

1151
01:10:33.850 --> 01:10:38.360
that was my day,
I guess.
I think I was like talking shit to you.
Like you,

1152
01:10:40.360 --> 01:10:44.120
my feelings were hurt and here's what socks for me is.
So if,

1153
01:10:44.270 --> 01:10:48.540
if both of us are on point,
I'm get,
I'm catching a beat down.
If so,

1154
01:10:48.550 --> 01:10:51.020
if both of us are bringing our a game on,
catching a beat down,

1155
01:10:51.760 --> 01:10:56.000
if deans bringing his a game and I'm bringing my week game,

1156
01:10:56.180 --> 01:10:57.170
I'm catching a beat down.

1157
01:10:57.650 --> 01:11:01.280
If I'm bringing my full a game and beans having a horrible day,

1158
01:11:01.310 --> 01:11:04.880
I could do like barely Oh Canada.
So it's like

1159
01:11:06.680 --> 01:11:09.950
the day,
the really good days that I have are,
are very few.
I have to,

1160
01:11:09.951 --> 01:11:14.120
I have to earn them.
I'll put it through that way.
I have to earn them.
And um,

1161
01:11:15.180 --> 01:11:20.070
<v 3>then so,
so you do UFC,
you do decent Ufcu had some tough fights,</v>

1162
01:11:20.550 --> 01:11:23.100
good fights,
three,
four ranked in my division,
my law,

1163
01:11:23.130 --> 01:11:26.430
my only two losses by decision was named Mark Ward and you shall call me.

1164
01:11:26.431 --> 01:11:30.840
And they both after that fight fire and the silver.
So I was two times right.

1165
01:11:30.841 --> 01:11:34.060
They're fighting for the belt.
I was top five top,
no,
I don't care tops.

1166
01:11:34.180 --> 01:11:37.650
But I fought to fight his silver and I lost both of his matches,

1167
01:11:37.980 --> 01:11:39.980
but the four I want.
And uh,

1168
01:11:40.020 --> 01:11:43.950
my first ride was Elissa Sakara who's from Italy's really tough fighter fat,

1169
01:11:44.490 --> 01:11:48.360
probably the fastest hands.
And actually I figured this out later.

1170
01:11:48.390 --> 01:11:52.350
I was the underdog,
but they were actually trying to feed me to him.

1171
01:11:52.680 --> 01:11:55.260
He was gonna fight chocolate all out.
Who you are stepping stone?

1172
01:11:55.590 --> 01:11:58.200
Well supposedly yes,
supposed to van de this group,

1173
01:11:58.280 --> 01:11:59.490
they're already planning like he's in a fight.

1174
01:11:59.490 --> 01:12:02.400
Chocolate l cause see I probably he has faster hands.

1175
01:12:02.700 --> 01:12:06.240
Probably Chuck has a really good chin,
better wrestling,

1176
01:12:06.241 --> 01:12:08.370
but Sacara it faster hands,
better boxing.

1177
01:12:08.400 --> 01:12:12.180
So I'll have them fight after is what I heard.
But um,

1178
01:12:12.210 --> 01:12:15.870
that day I got in the same triangle.
It shows you a cure in and uh,

1179
01:12:15.900 --> 01:12:18.090
but he taught the children here went to sleep.

1180
01:12:18.300 --> 01:12:22.830
So both my debuts won't one by the same move and uh,
against a tough guys.

1181
01:12:22.890 --> 01:12:25.320
So then I find out that the Japanese opponent,

1182
01:12:25.380 --> 01:12:28.200
I fight a Bulgarian Olympic wrestler,
I fought Nate Marquardt,

1183
01:12:28.201 --> 01:12:31.860
you should have called me and I fought Jeremy Horn.
So six fights in UFC.

1184
01:12:32.190 --> 01:12:37.190
So my career has been focused on Jujitsu more Nogi is because when you do MMA,

1185
01:12:37.651 --> 01:12:40.830
you don't,
you don't have a g or a chemo on one.
So it kind of wasting your time.

1186
01:12:40.950 --> 01:12:45.150
If you're training and that aspect and you don't have a gauge on your car,

1187
01:12:45.540 --> 01:12:48.540
how to grab the belt,
how to do this,
kind of wasting your time.
So yeah,

1188
01:12:48.780 --> 01:12:53.190
I've distributed my time between mixed martial arts and grappling Jujitsu.

1189
01:12:53.570 --> 01:12:58.170
And you weren't done either cause you went back in 2011.
Yeah.

1190
01:12:58.320 --> 01:13:03.320
You went back and well 2009 was that 2000 and thousand nine we were in

1191
01:13:03.481 --> 01:13:06.340
Barcelona,
Spain,
Barcelona and um,

1192
01:13:06.570 --> 01:13:10.950
yeah I was just well coming out by surgery.
It wasn't my,
it wasn't my year.
Yeah.

1193
01:13:11.370 --> 01:13:12.960
And those were some close matches having,

1194
01:13:13.020 --> 01:13:15.470
I was thinking about it the double overtime to Vinnie Magalia.
Yeah.

1195
01:13:15.600 --> 01:13:18.510
And we've next year and we both want our divisions well middle.

1196
01:13:18.511 --> 01:13:22.650
So his first match in the absolute and he had wine.
It was double overtime,
zero,

1197
01:13:22.651 --> 01:13:26.140
zero and well,
yeah.
The judges were looking at other,

1198
01:13:26.330 --> 01:13:28.180
like they raised his hands.

1199
01:13:29.100 --> 01:13:31.600
Did he have an Aluma plot on you or did you ever knew him?

1200
01:13:31.730 --> 01:13:34.680
I think that's why he won because I item two foot luxe.
Oh that's right.

1201
01:13:34.680 --> 01:13:36.990
You had him in two foot Luxy at him and he only went about doing pods and more

1202
01:13:36.991 --> 01:13:41.820
Jujitsu Ish,
I think that's why.
Yeah.
And then,
um,
yeah,

1203
01:13:41.821 --> 01:13:44.820
2011.
I don't know why.
Probably it was a harder tournament,

1204
01:13:44.850 --> 01:13:47.880
but I'm not saying it wasn't easy.

1205
01:13:48.240 --> 01:13:53.010
[inaudible] Nora came back.
You don't know why?
I don't,
I have no idea why,

1206
01:13:53.011 --> 01:13:57.380
but I,
yeah,
I just showed up and first match.

1207
01:13:57.620 --> 01:14:01.470
It was hard match.
Actually my friend,
I'll Cousteau Ferrari from Sao Paulo,

1208
01:14:01.471 --> 01:14:03.370
Brazil.
Very tough guy.
Um,

1209
01:14:04.230 --> 01:14:08.730
I thought that I'm top three or four seated right.

1210
01:14:08.940 --> 01:14:13.270
I was wrong.
He was,
he was like three and I was number 14 because now I'm 30,

1211
01:14:13.271 --> 01:14:17.930
I'm 35 and he was like 25 or like others get this old guy out of here.
Yeah,

1212
01:14:17.950 --> 01:14:20.670
knock him out of this thing I want,
I'm like,
that was the one,

1213
01:14:20.690 --> 01:14:23.570
the lowest rent guys.
That was a hard match.
My points.

1214
01:14:23.571 --> 01:14:25.060
The second guy was the European champion.

1215
01:14:25.061 --> 01:14:28.240
I feel locked in like two minutes and then we have one day to rest and I'm

1216
01:14:28.241 --> 01:14:32.470
facing a rental.
Javier,
who's total be someone can beat this guy.

1217
01:14:33.040 --> 01:14:37.380
He's like 21 and I'm 35 and this,
it was,
it was,

1218
01:14:37.390 --> 01:14:40.480
it was a not marching in England.
I can't,
I can't do that accent,
dammit.

1219
01:14:40.510 --> 01:14:45.370
But Nottingham England,
we were there and at the hotel I popped my rib.

1220
01:14:46.060 --> 01:14:47.860
I didn't want him to know my ribs pop.

1221
01:14:47.861 --> 01:14:51.400
Like during the batch a derm match with the Polish guy.

1222
01:14:51.460 --> 01:14:54.100
Orotic Turik European champion who he tried for loving me.

1223
01:14:54.430 --> 01:14:57.160
And it turned out it had popped my rib and I got his heel and I'm like,

1224
01:14:57.340 --> 01:15:01.870
my rib is unsat.
It's,
it's not,
it's not up to,
it's not up to standards,
you know?

1225
01:15:02.320 --> 01:15:04.330
So I'm like,
it hurts right now and I'm warm.

1226
01:15:05.110 --> 01:15:08.170
So I sat down and waiting for everyone to leave the arena so they wouldn't see

1227
01:15:08.171 --> 01:15:11.290
me.
You're like an Olympian home to the hotel.
So I didn't want to see,
you know,

1228
01:15:11.291 --> 01:15:14.410
appear strong when you're weak every week when you're strong.
So I was,

1229
01:15:14.620 --> 01:15:17.050
let's say we at the moment,
and I don't want people to see that.

1230
01:15:17.260 --> 01:15:20.980
So I got kind of walk real slow back to hotel.
And there's guys downstairs,

1231
01:15:21.530 --> 01:15:24.490
hey dean,
you're,
you're facing rural feared mom.
Like,
yeah,

1232
01:15:24.700 --> 01:15:27.820
do you know how good that guy is?
And I'm like,
yeah,
I heard no.

1233
01:15:27.821 --> 01:15:31.120
Do you actually understand what you're getting yourself into?
I'm like,
okay,

1234
01:15:31.180 --> 01:15:34.990
just stop it man.
It's just get the fuck,
get away from me.
And uh,
and uh,

1235
01:15:35.560 --> 01:15:38.530
I'm like trying to get my head kind of motivated me actually.

1236
01:15:38.620 --> 01:15:41.980
I like the a feeling like,
oh,
would you like to be an underdog man,

1237
01:15:42.010 --> 01:15:45.040
next day I showed up.
Oh.
And I saw [inaudible] he was competing with,

1238
01:15:45.041 --> 01:15:46.690
with spandex on.
I'm like,
oh yeah,

1239
01:15:46.691 --> 01:15:51.070
because it's harder to slip out of leg locks mixed day,
no shirt and no Spanish.

1240
01:15:51.300 --> 01:15:55.600
So someone told them something.
So I faced him and yeah,
he's,
you know,

1241
01:15:55.601 --> 01:15:59.260
he's like the future of the sport.
Awesome.
A great sport as well.

1242
01:15:59.470 --> 01:16:01.330
But it got him into,
but I think four minutes,

1243
01:16:01.331 --> 01:16:05.650
I got his heel in the four 11 which no one was doing and I'm moment.

1244
01:16:05.860 --> 01:16:07.390
So my 55th and for 11,

1245
01:16:07.720 --> 01:16:12.070
it was two of my nine lives of innovation that after I,
I did that.

1246
01:16:12.071 --> 01:16:15.310
People started doing it.
Yeah,
yeah,
of course when I did it,

1247
01:16:15.311 --> 01:16:17.910
no one understood what was going on.
And so if he was like,

1248
01:16:18.140 --> 01:16:22.030
it's like a secret weapon just to see that vision.
And then Joanna cease also,

1249
01:16:22.031 --> 01:16:24.520
he beat John G.
I took them down a mountain at him.

1250
01:16:24.550 --> 01:16:29.090
So beat someone like John g Joel sees is also super high level and uh,

1251
01:16:29.230 --> 01:16:33.760
but see mental mental games.
Um,
I'm older,
10 years older than,
than Joelle.

1252
01:16:33.790 --> 01:16:37.330
So I went to,
now at the time I speak good Portuguese,

1253
01:16:37.690 --> 01:16:41.890
so I'm in his corner was Leo Zinio via,
and Leo knows me,

1254
01:16:41.920 --> 01:16:44.120
he knows what for luck guy.
So,
so I'm like,

1255
01:16:44.380 --> 01:16:47.530
and I heard that Joie has good foot Luxton whatever it is.
So I'm,

1256
01:16:47.610 --> 01:16:52.330
I'm kind of talking like to him,
I'm like,
Hey,
I'm a keep saying,

1257
01:16:52.420 --> 01:16:55.720
my foot's right here.
Come on.
And I'm a weekly and my feet like in his armpit,

1258
01:16:55.721 --> 01:17:00.070
like,
go for it.
And he's like,
he goes,
I don't think so man.
And then Lee was like,

1259
01:17:00.160 --> 01:17:04.810
no,
no,
but I could see before the match.
It's like he's not,

1260
01:17:04.960 --> 01:17:08.050
he's not cocky,
but I could see he has a little pride.

1261
01:17:08.050 --> 01:17:11.090
I can just tell him he's younger than me,
so I'm like,
I'm played that.
I came,

1262
01:17:11.870 --> 01:17:14.240
I'm like,
that'll put you on my game.
You know,
he has good full marks,

1263
01:17:14.241 --> 01:17:18.410
but that's my board's Forte.
Let's see.
So eventually I'm like,
hey man,

1264
01:17:18.411 --> 01:17:21.380
this right here,
I heard you have good full lux.
I was too much.

1265
01:17:21.381 --> 01:17:26.310
He went from my foot and then I go,
what do you do?
You

1266
01:17:29.330 --> 01:17:32.170
see the thing is like right when he got older,

1267
01:17:32.171 --> 01:17:33.230
you got to use those little tricks.

1268
01:17:33.231 --> 01:17:37.280
You know sometimes you did that thing where when they go for your foot and that

1269
01:17:37.281 --> 01:17:41.250
opens up punching,
punch me,
I'll punch you back.
But yes,

1270
01:17:41.710 --> 01:17:43.880
but I have to be confident I can take a punch.
Right.
Well,

1271
01:17:43.881 --> 01:17:48.060
I'm somewhat confident that I can resist a leg lock or countering time and,

1272
01:17:48.330 --> 01:17:49.250
and it all worked.
You know,

1273
01:17:49.251 --> 01:17:51.350
it's funny because I'm sitting here laughing at laughing at that.

1274
01:17:51.350 --> 01:17:55.270
But you do that to me.
Yeah.
And know you don't.
You don't fall for it though.
Yeah,

1275
01:17:55.280 --> 01:17:58.280
but then I will.
Yeah.
Eventually I'll be like,
fuck,

1276
01:17:58.340 --> 01:18:00.800
I can get dressed and I'll just go for it and then you'll,

1277
01:18:00.920 --> 01:18:04.320
you'll get yolk for wrong me from,
yeah,
exactly.
I get that's junk.

1278
01:18:04.340 --> 01:18:09.340
Was Sin went back again in 2013 for the GCC again,

1279
01:18:10.900 --> 01:18:13.730
it took silver to Jamal.
He won that year.
He won that year.

1280
01:18:13.880 --> 01:18:16.970
How anywhere I went for and I talked the referees afterwards.

1281
01:18:16.971 --> 01:18:17.804
It wasn't their fault.

1282
01:18:17.990 --> 01:18:21.500
I went for like a lock and he was I exact moment to suite me.

1283
01:18:21.560 --> 01:18:25.490
I did it wrong though.
I got greedy that time.
He had the arm position.

1284
01:18:25.520 --> 01:18:27.830
I went for the wrong move.
Technically,

1285
01:18:28.040 --> 01:18:32.180
if the referees knew I was going for legal,
like it's not as sweet,
but I was up.

1286
01:18:32.420 --> 01:18:37.100
I've got my points by one point I haven't been triangle and he's really strong.

1287
01:18:37.250 --> 01:18:39.830
He's flexing his ladder.
I'm like,
I have 30 seconds.
I'm not,

1288
01:18:39.950 --> 01:18:43.010
I haven't been locked and triangle,
but it was hard.
I was on the opposite side.

1289
01:18:43.011 --> 01:18:45.560
I'm like,
you know what he's doing?
The muscle is out one by one point.

1290
01:18:45.860 --> 01:18:49.760
So I opened up my full guard from the bottom,
turning my stomach.
He got my back.

1291
01:18:49.761 --> 01:18:54.350
So we actually won a four,
four,
four.
So you're trying to,
yeah,

1292
01:18:54.351 --> 01:18:56.330
because otherwise I can mentally be like,

1293
01:18:56.660 --> 01:18:59.760
you know what little thoughts racing through your mind.
You know,
I,
I can,

1294
01:19:00.080 --> 01:19:02.940
I know I'm going to lose,
but I would say I would have submitted them like,

1295
01:19:02.960 --> 01:19:07.130
you know,
but I'm going to lose the only chance I have really,

1296
01:19:07.190 --> 01:19:09.200
unless I had been there two minutes.
Then it's different.

1297
01:19:09.950 --> 01:19:13.190
So I had to take a chance.
It's a one in 10 chance and it didn't pay off.

1298
01:19:13.460 --> 01:19:15.910
It took silver.
I was really upset about taking solar,

1299
01:19:15.920 --> 01:19:19.010
but in the end up Adobe silver is not too bad.
Right?
No.

1300
01:19:19.790 --> 01:19:22.520
Your second best in the entire world.
The reason it's pretty time gold.

1301
01:19:22.521 --> 01:19:27.200
One time silver.
And then you did the absolute that year too.
Oh,
did right.
Yeah,

1302
01:19:27.201 --> 01:19:28.034
that's right.

1303
01:19:28.220 --> 01:19:30.880
That's one of my favorite matches that you've ever done as against Chacha.

1304
01:19:30.960 --> 01:19:35.840
You wish lost.
It was tied up zero,
zero for nine minutes and eat.

1305
01:19:36.220 --> 01:19:40.910
He was like 22 I'm 35 and now I'm 37 now.
And Man,

1306
01:19:40.911 --> 01:19:44.220
it was how it was this weird cause I wasn't intimidated.
But yeah,

1307
01:19:44.320 --> 01:19:46.790
he's very healthy.
He's got east,

1308
01:19:47.050 --> 01:19:50.990
but people were user was strong and athletic.
Read technical.
Someone's like,
okay,

1309
01:19:50.991 --> 01:19:53.030
be careful this.
I'm like,
be careful.
I'm going to give,

1310
01:19:53.090 --> 01:19:54.160
I'm going to give him my leg.
You know her.

1311
01:19:54.161 --> 01:19:56.630
I just walk out hopping after on my leg and he's like,
what the hell?

1312
01:19:57.140 --> 01:20:00.320
And he grabbed my leg,
took it up.
There's no points.
He had meetings to Smith.

1313
01:20:00.340 --> 01:20:04.910
I am three submissions.
It was awesome at the end I took them down,
got mounted,

1314
01:20:04.911 --> 01:20:07.910
but my foot was stuck so it didn't count any Oupa

1315
01:20:08.120 --> 01:20:10.440
<v 2>whoops me shoulder roll and Portuguese over.</v>

1316
01:20:10.800 --> 01:20:12.710
That's two points in Abu Dhabi we'll put means.

1317
01:20:12.770 --> 01:20:15.720
And actually it actually means shoulder roll or is that just,

1318
01:20:15.721 --> 01:20:20.030
I thought it was just a noise that thought made everyone's,
that's all.
Bye.
Oh,

1319
01:20:20.080 --> 01:20:24.090
okay.
Buys is shorter.
Well,
but if you talked to someone that doesn't do Jujitsu,

1320
01:20:24.180 --> 01:20:28.710
open doesn't mean shoulder.
All it means is Jitsu term.
Okay,
oop.
I mean shoulder,

1321
01:20:28.711 --> 01:20:30.960
we'll,
yeah.
Oh,
escaped him out.

1322
01:20:31.230 --> 01:20:34.650
So he did that and he's the one Dan Brazilian who has a wrestler bridge.

1323
01:20:34.680 --> 01:20:37.410
Like he brushed up on it,
it took me over and I'm like God damn.

1324
01:20:37.430 --> 01:20:41.460
And I know that move for like when I was 14 years old but he took me over and I

1325
01:20:41.461 --> 01:20:46.030
was in my full guard.
He's up to zero.
Anyone like that?
So it was a good match.

1326
01:20:46.180 --> 01:20:48.480
Good match that's on Youtube.
Go Watch that match.

1327
01:20:48.481 --> 01:20:51.450
If you want to just see we were exhausted out of that will.
That is,

1328
01:20:51.510 --> 01:20:55.230
that is just a beast of a match.
It's a beast of an I could not,

1329
01:20:55.270 --> 01:20:56.280
I'm going to say cool.
Yeah.

1330
01:20:56.430 --> 01:21:00.480
Couldn't when my shoulders afterwards and I'm like this is gonna suck.

1331
01:21:02.580 --> 01:21:06.390
It's weird cause you had injuries along the way obviously,

1332
01:21:06.480 --> 01:21:10.210
but like you write it how many knee surgeries if you had to and,

1333
01:21:10.260 --> 01:21:13.110
but those were when you were pretty young,
right?
Yeah,
but I got older.

1334
01:21:13.111 --> 01:21:17.280
It's like my shoulder on my bicep.
You were there in the gym on my bicep snapped.

1335
01:21:17.730 --> 01:21:22.730
That was terrible.
It's boring.
What I go listers done under.

1336
01:21:22.830 --> 01:21:27.630
Usually done?
Yeah,
undisputed.
Yeah,
it was the guy was blocking with his elbow.

1337
01:21:27.631 --> 01:21:29.500
He's trying to knock me out,
so I was like,
oh,
I'll knock you out.

1338
01:21:29.510 --> 01:21:33.030
Then just wanting to honor wasn't really warm yet and I hit his elbow with my

1339
01:21:33.120 --> 01:21:36.870
bicep snapped.
Terrible.
I'm like,
I didn't know you could snap your bicep,

1340
01:21:36.930 --> 01:21:40.830
but you can.
Yes.
You confirmed.
Yeah.
Double,

1341
01:21:41.430 --> 01:21:44.790
double confirmed.
What do you do when you win?

1342
01:21:45.300 --> 01:21:48.840
Like when you've got an injury?
What's,

1343
01:21:48.900 --> 01:21:51.300
what's your philosophy around trying to get it to heal?

1344
01:21:51.300 --> 01:21:54.150
Because people get injured during Jiu Jitsu or you know,
it's,

1345
01:21:54.151 --> 01:21:56.430
it's difficult for me because,

1346
01:21:57.870 --> 01:22:01.800
but I could try to make it as simple as possible.
See Jujitsu,
boxing,

1347
01:22:01.980 --> 01:22:06.180
any kind of a confrontational thing,
which you are an expert in and the military,

1348
01:22:06.600 --> 01:22:07.560
but also in Jujitsu.

1349
01:22:07.890 --> 01:22:12.890
I mean even if it's not a fun because you're getting smashed,

1350
01:22:14.040 --> 01:22:18.000
you're not bored,
you're not bored.
So we can't train Jujitsu.

1351
01:22:18.600 --> 01:22:20.130
Me Now I know we're different.

1352
01:22:20.490 --> 01:22:23.460
I personally don't like looking at myself in the mirror.

1353
01:22:23.461 --> 01:22:26.550
I don't like that at all.
But with weights,
I,
I get bored.
Personally.

1354
01:22:26.850 --> 01:22:30.570
I want to have someone trying to Herzmark and they don't want to get hurt,

1355
01:22:30.571 --> 01:22:34.920
but that at least I can be mentally immersed in,
in the issue.

1356
01:22:35.360 --> 01:22:39.270
Um,
so that makes our,
for me so personally I,

1357
01:22:40.110 --> 01:22:44.400
I focused on other things like learning languages or traveling or doing
seminars,

1358
01:22:44.401 --> 01:22:46.970
things like that.
How many languages do you speak all at once?

1359
01:22:46.980 --> 01:22:51.900
Out Team speaks seven languages.
I speak three in the way that I can make jokes.

1360
01:22:51.901 --> 01:22:56.070
I can argue and I can spell well I can write and I could read a Portuguese,

1361
01:22:56.071 --> 01:22:59.790
Spanish and English French.
I can,
uh,
I can have a conversation,

1362
01:23:00.090 --> 01:23:02.370
but I'm not smooth.
I have a big accent.

1363
01:23:02.640 --> 01:23:05.970
I couldn't make jokes and I couldn't effectively argue unless I to sound like

1364
01:23:05.980 --> 01:23:09.550
more at a nice,
I can,
I can do that.

1365
01:23:09.580 --> 01:23:14.140
Maybe I was sound like Croatian was a musical core crops coach,

1366
01:23:14.620 --> 01:23:19.360
uh,
for like seven years.
Like survival.
Like I want to go there.
How are you like,

1367
01:23:19.420 --> 01:23:24.370
you know,
so three or four or five,
depends on your definition.
Even German.

1368
01:23:24.371 --> 01:23:25.510
I can kind of get around a little bit,

1369
01:23:25.511 --> 01:23:28.480
but it's just on the street asking for directions and stuff like that,

1370
01:23:28.481 --> 01:23:31.660
but it's not good.
So three,
I guess three.
I'll say three.
Three solid.

1371
01:23:32.680 --> 01:23:36.370
Let's talk some Jujitsu philosophies,
sheets,
GI or no GI.

1372
01:23:37.660 --> 01:23:40.630
That's like saying,
um,
what do you like doing better?

1373
01:23:40.980 --> 01:23:45.490
A long distance runner versus a sprinter or a judo versus wrestling.

1374
01:23:45.870 --> 01:23:49.060
Uh,
kickboxing and boxing.
There's different sports.
They're related.

1375
01:23:49.180 --> 01:23:53.900
There's similar,
there's a lot of mechanical similarities.
So Oak,

1376
01:23:53.901 --> 01:23:57.340
he is better for,
uh,
it does help you to get a tighter of style,

1377
01:23:57.550 --> 01:24:00.280
but if you're wasting not wasting the saying,
yeah,
yeah.

1378
01:24:00.430 --> 01:24:02.560
If you're going to be doing Nogi,
and I know,
I know some,

1379
01:24:03.280 --> 01:24:06.460
I don't know if anyone watching knows,
knows the significance of this.

1380
01:24:07.030 --> 01:24:10.820
A wrestler knows right away this is wrong.
This is,
uh,

1381
01:24:11.440 --> 01:24:15.900
this is the,
a gable grip.
This is the script.
They're fine.
This is the BS grip.

1382
01:24:16.050 --> 01:24:18.250
It doesn't work.
A lot of world champions,

1383
01:24:18.251 --> 01:24:20.740
the only train all over a sleeve and belt.

1384
01:24:21.400 --> 01:24:25.450
They grabbed like this because they're taught to rely upon the uniform.

1385
01:24:25.690 --> 01:24:28.300
So if you rely upon the uniform and you don't have the uniform,

1386
01:24:28.570 --> 01:24:33.400
now 80% of your tools are gone.
So I think it's good to do both.

1387
01:24:34.120 --> 01:24:37.950
It's normal to prefer one over the other,
but don't discount,
uh,
no.

1388
01:24:37.951 --> 01:24:42.280
Gies more technical and faster and the transitions.
Absolutely.

1389
01:24:42.370 --> 01:24:45.910
And the fact that you can slip out of something easier means,

1390
01:24:45.911 --> 01:24:50.440
I'd say a transition to the next move faster,
but GE has more options.

1391
01:24:50.441 --> 01:24:54.400
I have many chokes I can do,
I can grab my own belt,
wrap it around your wrist.

1392
01:24:54.670 --> 01:24:59.020
You can't do that without Ge.
Uh,
so that's only,
so some people say,

1393
01:24:59.021 --> 01:25:02.500
some people will say,
gee is more technical,

1394
01:25:02.860 --> 01:25:07.000
but I don't believe that it's more technical.
Different.
There might be,
I guess,

1395
01:25:07.360 --> 01:25:10.030
no,
I was going to say maybe there's more techniques,
but there is not theirs.

1396
01:25:10.150 --> 01:25:12.820
It's equal.
I just think they're equal.
Yeah,

1397
01:25:13.390 --> 01:25:16.720
they're equal and technical because to hold someone down with the Geek as a lot

1398
01:25:16.721 --> 01:25:18.940
easier and you get someone across side with the g,

1399
01:25:18.970 --> 01:25:22.360
like you're going to hold them down.
You get across side and someone with Nogi,

1400
01:25:22.450 --> 01:25:27.030
it's a lot harder to hold him down because there's nothing to hold onto and so

1401
01:25:27.040 --> 01:25:31.570
it makes it harder.
That's why I think Nogi made sure office better.

1402
01:25:32.340 --> 01:25:35.230
He makes your defense.
Yeah,
that makes it harder to slip kind of things.

1403
01:25:35.350 --> 01:25:38.620
If you're in a submission with Ge,
it's hard to slip out of the,
you know,

1404
01:25:38.760 --> 01:25:40.360
you can get lucky.
It's really hard.

1405
01:25:40.361 --> 01:25:42.010
You're not really going to slip out of things.
Also,

1406
01:25:42.011 --> 01:25:43.450
if you're training with wrestling shoes,
it's different.

1407
01:25:43.780 --> 01:25:47.410
If you ate with the fatigues,
it's different training with the marines,

1408
01:25:48.580 --> 01:25:53.470
the team guys or a train the police,
whatever done in Brazil as well.

1409
01:25:53.680 --> 01:25:58.010
I mean they train like how there aren't duty,
you know?
So having someone with a,

1410
01:25:58.320 --> 01:26:01.570
you know,
fatigues on,
you still call the fatigues and no,
no.
Yeah,

1411
01:26:01.571 --> 01:26:06.290
I usually just go into Cambiz.
Cammies that's cute.
Sorry Dude.

1412
01:26:06.291 --> 01:26:10.080
That's what I call them.
Get you cammies on.
Yeah,

1413
01:26:10.230 --> 01:26:14.270
Btus and there were,
there we go.
I remember,
I don't know.

1414
01:26:14.271 --> 01:26:17.690
We are everyone I know.
We just called him cammies fatigues.

1415
01:26:18.200 --> 01:26:23.200
Maybe it's cute to you told God should a human being pulled guard and a fight?

1416
01:26:23.661 --> 01:26:26.540
No.
Oh,
unless it's a controlled like USC.
I pulled garden one,

1417
01:26:26.541 --> 01:26:31.310
but that's because there's one person right there and their forte is striking

1418
01:26:31.910 --> 01:26:35.780
and to the end of my hose,
the end of my career,
people wouldn't fall for that.

1419
01:26:35.781 --> 01:26:37.250
They just get the hell away from me.

1420
01:26:37.251 --> 01:26:42.251
But I've wanted to fights where even one the guy was across side on top and he

1421
01:26:43.731 --> 01:26:44.690
could have just got away from me.

1422
01:26:44.690 --> 01:26:48.740
But he proceeded to attack me and then I reversed triangle arm off.

1423
01:26:48.790 --> 01:26:52.370
It was a change leads my friend now,
a very tough guy,

1424
01:26:52.371 --> 01:26:57.260
but he engaged my strength.
Uh,
so you could,
same thing like cro,

1425
01:26:57.261 --> 01:27:02.150
cop,
probably the most notorious at high kick and history at MMA.

1426
01:27:02.180 --> 01:27:04.340
You know,
he broke a lot of grounds with that average guy.

1427
01:27:04.341 --> 01:27:07.610
You wouldn't say just left like head.
Yeah.
It's not gonna work that well,

1428
01:27:07.790 --> 01:27:09.290
but it works.
You do it really well.

1429
01:27:09.650 --> 01:27:11.630
I wouldn't say it's a good strategy in a fight,

1430
01:27:11.660 --> 01:27:15.770
but it's good to do because you get to a situation where you're familiar.

1431
01:27:15.771 --> 01:27:19.280
You have hold you up your legs and your arms engaging the opponent and you can

1432
01:27:19.281 --> 01:27:21.620
work from there.
But you have to have a guard.
You can't just,

1433
01:27:21.710 --> 01:27:25.160
oh I'm to sit in the bottom be good.
Oh,
but across my feet and I'm fine.
No,

1434
01:27:25.280 --> 01:27:28.520
you got beat up in a fight.
Yeah.
So if you're,
if you're good there,
you can do it.

1435
01:27:28.730 --> 01:27:31.950
It's not a general thing I would recommend though.
Yeah.
You know it's,

1436
01:27:31.970 --> 01:27:35.870
I was just remembering that when you fought Nate mark court in the UFC,

1437
01:27:36.650 --> 01:27:41.180
that was the,
what bummed me out about that is I can hear Jackson going,

1438
01:27:41.420 --> 01:27:42.390
you're not draw a punch,

1439
01:27:42.420 --> 01:27:47.120
you don't garden to use this like so strict that the game plan.
So Greg Jackson,

1440
01:27:47.180 --> 01:27:51.320
who is a really smart strategist where the smart,
and I'm Kinda like,

1441
01:27:51.340 --> 01:27:54.020
you know your strategists.
So it was like my strategy,

1442
01:27:54.021 --> 01:27:57.620
I'm supposed to be cornering you and telling you what to do strategy wise.

1443
01:27:58.070 --> 01:28:02.390
And Greg Jackson is on the other side telling Nate what to do strategy wise.

1444
01:28:02.900 --> 01:28:05.450
And after the fight I was even during the,

1445
01:28:05.451 --> 01:28:09.650
well that's what pissed me off was that during the fight I didn't recognize

1446
01:28:09.651 --> 01:28:13.970
quickly enough what was happening and what was happening was mate mark or was

1447
01:28:13.971 --> 01:28:17.610
just not moving.
So all he was doing was waiting for the referee stand up.

1448
01:28:17.810 --> 01:28:21.650
Then I can't expose nothing cause you know,
Nate was better on the feet.

1449
01:28:21.800 --> 01:28:26.040
He's also blocked bummed Judith be good too,
but he didn't want to play around.

1450
01:28:26.350 --> 01:28:30.100
There's no why take the chance.
Right.
The chance is there's a,
there's a yeah,

1451
01:28:30.220 --> 01:28:34.190
a much higher percentage of him getting submitted than it is of him getting

1452
01:28:34.191 --> 01:28:35.180
knocked out by you.
Yeah.

1453
01:28:35.330 --> 01:28:40.330
So he would just literally hold dean in weight and I got strategically beat by

1454
01:28:41.871 --> 01:28:44.990
Greg Jackson.
Now I love Greg Jackson.
I think he's an awesome guy.

1455
01:28:44.991 --> 01:28:48.050
And then I was hung out with her and he's a super guy and like,

1456
01:28:48.200 --> 01:28:52.550
it bummed me out that he tactically,
we strategically beat me,
um,

1457
01:28:52.730 --> 01:28:54.830
with that plan,
which was,
hey,

1458
01:28:54.831 --> 01:28:57.270
we're just gonna hold and we're going to wait for the referee standup.

1459
01:28:57.290 --> 01:28:59.090
And it was something that we didn't train for.

1460
01:28:59.420 --> 01:29:01.830
We didn't train for it until later.
Then we started training for like,
okay,

1461
01:29:02.250 --> 01:29:05.340
the other thing,
we had to start training for someone that runs away from you.

1462
01:29:05.880 --> 01:29:07.950
Right?
Because a lot of guys,
they would,

1463
01:29:07.980 --> 01:29:11.370
they would just try and get away from you.
That's all they wanted.
And so that's,

1464
01:29:11.430 --> 01:29:13.530
that's very difficult to contend with.

1465
01:29:13.830 --> 01:29:16.560
I wish that we could have a fight like in an elevator

1466
01:29:20.350 --> 01:29:23.330
and list your champion because I can't get away from them.

1467
01:29:23.610 --> 01:29:26.320
Or like in a movie theater,
like I'm sitting next to you.
Ready?
Cool.

1468
01:29:30.570 --> 01:29:32.760
I liked that range is,
it was my style.
You know what I'm saying?

1469
01:29:34.200 --> 01:29:37.260
You are meant for that.
You were meant for that.
Do you,

1470
01:29:37.290 --> 01:29:40.410
what do you think about when you see all the foot locks?

1471
01:29:40.470 --> 01:29:43.120
That's become such a huge focus of the game?
Um,

1472
01:29:43.170 --> 01:29:48.170
right now I'm kind of like I told you so because I,

1473
01:29:48.670 --> 01:29:52.350
you know,
you were in the middle of this.
I had about 10 years of,
yeah,

1474
01:29:52.351 --> 01:29:56.030
you're doing good with that somehow,
but we don't,
you know,
that's wrong.
Yeah.

1475
01:29:56.250 --> 01:29:59.730
And Oh,
by the way,
Jerry Costa Kid pay league will.
Yeah.

1476
01:29:59.880 --> 01:30:03.420
He actually told me when I was blue,
he goes,
you know,
Dean,
this philosophy,

1477
01:30:03.430 --> 01:30:08.340
it's Kinda like tacky.
And when I won,
he was there in Brazil.
When I won,

1478
01:30:08.520 --> 01:30:13.140
he walked,
he went in English,
she's Brazilian.
He goes,
lister fit God.

1479
01:30:13.141 --> 01:30:16.830
You didn't listen to me on my bullshit.
Awesome.
He's a great guy.
He is.

1480
01:30:16.831 --> 01:30:20.280
He's awesome.
He,
uh,
at the time it was just,
that was the way,

1481
01:30:20.610 --> 01:30:25.450
and yeah,
I do use some cliches,
but some cliches makes sense.
Uh,

1482
01:30:25.710 --> 01:30:28.890
we know the rules now you can break the rules if you don't know the rules.

1483
01:30:30.190 --> 01:30:33.270
So I knew the rules and you can get away with doing that because no one else was

1484
01:30:33.271 --> 01:30:33.661
doing that.

1485
01:30:33.661 --> 01:30:38.661
And sometimes they break rules because I don't want to react in a way my

1486
01:30:38.910 --> 01:30:40.530
opponent will predict so easily.

1487
01:30:40.780 --> 01:30:44.610
So I'll do something wrong because it's unexpected.
I'll do something that,
well,

1488
01:30:44.910 --> 01:30:48.030
those who don't do do Jujitsu and I understand this,
but I'm in new guard.

1489
01:30:48.690 --> 01:30:50.370
I'll reach my arm down inside.

1490
01:30:50.730 --> 01:30:53.900
Like I'm a white belt knowing you will go for triangle.
Yeah.

1491
01:30:54.110 --> 01:30:55.760
And as I I'm around your guard.
Yeah,
no,
no.

1492
01:30:55.770 --> 01:30:57.990
I know you're one teacher had to white belt,
they'll get caught triangle.

1493
01:30:58.560 --> 01:31:02.280
So I do things like that just cause it's weird.
I'm weird too,
but yeah.

1494
01:31:02.340 --> 01:31:07.200
So that's my style.
But yeah.
Naturebox.
Yeah.
What do you think about,

1495
01:31:07.360 --> 01:31:08.193
uh,

1496
01:31:08.580 --> 01:31:13.580
some people talk about the self defense techniques of Jujitsu and or the lack of

1497
01:31:14.821 --> 01:31:18.480
self defense techniques.
Virginia too.
Now what I will say is this,

1498
01:31:18.900 --> 01:31:23.900
I've been in some self defense classes that you're teaching and you don't focus

1499
01:31:23.971 --> 01:31:25.570
it on a lot,
but occasionally you'll do itself.

1500
01:31:25.980 --> 01:31:29.370
I act almost every time you teach one of those self defense classes.

1501
01:31:29.520 --> 01:31:34.020
I pick something up,
I learned something.
Okay.
Well I,

1502
01:31:35.130 --> 01:31:40.070
it is true.
When we were young starting,
it was from born from the UFC.

1503
01:31:40.470 --> 01:31:43.080
Let's see.
Motive.
It was like,
oh,
hoists Gracie.
That was the main thing.

1504
01:31:43.320 --> 01:31:44.620
Hixon Gracie,
you know,

1505
01:31:44.820 --> 01:31:49.820
valley to ODOT and back then at least your coach could fight or has been in

1506
01:31:50.251 --> 01:31:50.820
fights.

1507
01:31:50.820 --> 01:31:55.820
And I'm not criticizing anyone but it's a martial art martial being wet or

1508
01:31:56.460 --> 01:31:59.700
confrontation.
I'm not saying you want to be a cop,

1509
01:31:59.890 --> 01:32:01.600
be confrontational or be in fights,

1510
01:32:01.601 --> 01:32:05.200
but if you can't use Jiu Jitsu to defend yourself when it counts most.

1511
01:32:05.920 --> 01:32:10.900
And I don't know if it's not really a martial art anymore.
So yeah.
Um,

1512
01:32:12.310 --> 01:32:16.870
on the other hand,
if you think that I've had people told me this,
well you,
I DNR,

1513
01:32:17.050 --> 01:32:20.640
I saw your,
you're a good fight and you'll see,
oh but you know,
if you tried,

1514
01:32:20.650 --> 01:32:24.790
I mean I poke your eyes and I go,
okay,
thanks for letting me know.
Warning me.

1515
01:32:24.791 --> 01:32:27.550
Cause that's kind of scary.
I could poke their eyes too.

1516
01:32:27.551 --> 01:32:32.050
I don't tell him cause challenge,
argument.
See if you do one class one time,

1517
01:32:33.190 --> 01:32:36.340
you know,
that's why you have to roll and do it again for boxing.

1518
01:32:36.730 --> 01:32:38.530
You need someone to actually throwing punches at,
you.

1519
01:32:39.100 --> 01:32:43.150
Learn how to stop those and move away from the punches.
Just hitting a bag or,

1520
01:32:43.460 --> 01:32:44.560
and I hit back,
you know,

1521
01:32:44.561 --> 01:32:48.880
so let's see if anyone in your listening is under 25.

1522
01:32:48.910 --> 01:32:52.600
No one's gonna understand what that means.
But,
so having this,

1523
01:32:52.840 --> 01:32:55.630
putting herself in hard situations,
escape,
Jujitsu,

1524
01:32:55.820 --> 01:32:57.430
all is all about problem solving.
You know,

1525
01:32:57.431 --> 01:32:59.590
you get to a situation and you learn how to solve the problem.

1526
01:32:59.591 --> 01:33:02.230
You get relaxed and you learn to deal with this.

1527
01:33:02.380 --> 01:33:06.730
I think that's really important to know how to relax,

1528
01:33:06.760 --> 01:33:10.670
how to conserve your energy.
As you said,
knowing when to attack.
There's psyops,

1529
01:33:10.671 --> 01:33:14.680
hers,
his mental tactics.
There's a,
you know,
you could tell a lot about person,

1530
01:33:15.350 --> 01:33:19.150
uh,
how they fight.
You can see if they're dirty,
if they take shortcuts,

1531
01:33:19.300 --> 01:33:21.400
if they have a temper,
you can see if their patient,

1532
01:33:21.490 --> 01:33:23.260
you can see if they're explosive.
You can see if the lack,

1533
01:33:23.270 --> 01:33:25.270
today's go lackadaisical.
You can see it.

1534
01:33:25.271 --> 01:33:29.050
A lot of things about somebody if they're greedy.
That's what I'm laughing.

1535
01:33:29.080 --> 01:33:33.850
He's going to a accuses me of being greed and he's right.

1536
01:33:33.970 --> 01:33:36.820
I will get greedy with a move and I'll hang on to something that I shouldn't

1537
01:33:36.821 --> 01:33:37.654
hang on to.

1538
01:33:37.720 --> 01:33:40.900
And I'll end up in a position that I shouldn't be in and then dean will

1539
01:33:40.901 --> 01:33:45.460
immediately start going,
greed,
greed,
you know.

1540
01:33:46.530 --> 01:33:46.940
Well,
you know,

1541
01:33:46.940 --> 01:33:50.160
you can tell a lot about a person by how they fight and also how they handle it,

1542
01:33:50.161 --> 01:33:51.520
the feet and how they handle the victory.

1543
01:33:52.180 --> 01:33:54.580
That's why I don't do as an outward display,

1544
01:33:54.581 --> 01:33:58.210
but every time I win against someone,
I never run around and yelling.
I,

1545
01:33:58.500 --> 01:34:03.340
I check on them and if I was lose,
I shake my opponent's hand.
Uh,
I'm not,

1546
01:34:03.610 --> 01:34:05.750
there's nothing,
I'm not saying anything,
add more about that,
but,

1547
01:34:06.130 --> 01:34:08.720
but that's something I always strive to be as somewhat disrespectful.

1548
01:34:08.790 --> 01:34:10.870
You can see,
as you said,

1549
01:34:10.871 --> 01:34:15.871
humility is taught and people don't like to be humbled.

1550
01:34:16.660 --> 01:34:19.330
They're probably not going to last very long doing a martial art,

1551
01:34:19.360 --> 01:34:24.160
especially just because it's such a close and personal,

1552
01:34:24.370 --> 01:34:28.030
like you got owned like that and there's no escape that are belongs to Jocko.

1553
01:34:28.031 --> 01:34:31.480
There's no debate.
There's no debate.
You just got tapped out.

1554
01:34:31.481 --> 01:34:34.210
You can't lie in a fight.
You just got tapped out.

1555
01:34:34.390 --> 01:34:38.770
Now with some other martial arts,
it's like,
well,
you know,
if this was real fight,

1556
01:34:38.771 --> 01:34:40.780
I would have done this or that.
Or if I would have punched him harder,

1557
01:34:40.781 --> 01:34:42.880
I would have done something else.
I would have done some different,
it's like,

1558
01:34:43.570 --> 01:34:44.590
did you do too?
You just got,

1559
01:34:44.591 --> 01:34:47.810
you got put in a position where this dude could have ripped your shoulder apart

1560
01:34:48.190 --> 01:34:52.240
or put you to sleep and killed you.
So,
so there's,

1561
01:34:52.300 --> 01:34:55.780
there's truth in Jujitsu and that's why it's so humbling.
So I said,

1562
01:34:55.781 --> 01:34:57.960
you could tell a lot by how someone is,
uh,

1563
01:34:58.370 --> 01:35:03.100
<v 3>okay.
If we have a sport,
like,
okay,
cough or sprinting,
okay,
these,</v>

1564
01:35:03.110 --> 01:35:04.340
these are all sports and they're good.

1565
01:35:04.341 --> 01:35:08.610
But I don't know how someone is a swinging a golf club.

1566
01:35:08.650 --> 01:35:10.190
I can't tell too much about the personality,

1567
01:35:10.191 --> 01:35:13.460
but if someone takes a punch and they look right back at you and they punch you

1568
01:35:13.461 --> 01:35:14.880
back,
yeah,
that person's a,

1569
01:35:15.440 --> 01:35:17.840
there's something about that guy that's different than the average guy who turns

1570
01:35:17.841 --> 01:35:19.470
away and runs away.
Okay.
Um,

1571
01:35:19.730 --> 01:35:23.540
if someone tries to our mock me and I relax and I escaped,

1572
01:35:24.110 --> 01:35:25.220
I time it correctly.
Okay.

1573
01:35:25.250 --> 01:35:29.530
There's timing and his technique of course make some kind of sense.
Um,

1574
01:35:30.290 --> 01:35:33.950
I don't know,
back to the salt offense aspect.

1575
01:35:35.270 --> 01:35:39.590
Yeah.
I think,
I think you should be prepared for worst case scenario.

1576
01:35:39.591 --> 01:35:44.060
And actually for some weird reason now that I can fight,
I don't know,

1577
01:35:44.061 --> 01:35:48.410
one even messes with me.
I don't,
I don't go,
I'm not going to try to pick,

1578
01:35:48.470 --> 01:35:49.280
pick fights where they went,

1579
01:35:49.280 --> 01:35:52.010
but for some reason like no one even tries to fight me right now.

1580
01:35:52.100 --> 01:35:53.600
I wonder why I'm not,

1581
01:35:54.290 --> 01:35:59.120
but you know what I noticed like Bro,
you know,
you know,

1582
01:35:59.240 --> 01:36:01.070
in Japan and Russia and Brazil,

1583
01:36:01.220 --> 01:36:06.220
whatever coratia in any country you can imagine I'd been to for some reason and

1584
01:36:08.091 --> 01:36:12.590
I'm,
I'm by far like not a,
um,
a criminal or something like that.

1585
01:36:12.591 --> 01:36:13.490
But for some reason you get,

1586
01:36:13.491 --> 01:36:17.480
you get a lot of these gangster mafia type guys that are fans and you end up

1587
01:36:17.481 --> 01:36:19.520
hanging out with these guys and it happened in Russia.

1588
01:36:19.910 --> 01:36:22.220
I'm not glorifying anything but these guys,

1589
01:36:22.221 --> 01:36:24.500
you wouldn't even know they're gangsters.
These guys are powerful.

1590
01:36:24.600 --> 01:36:28.880
These are powerful guys.
You don't want to anger.
And also Jocko himself navies.

1591
01:36:29.260 --> 01:36:33.590
Hey Jocko,
what do you do?
I'm an investor.
Um,
Jocko,
where you're in the navy.
Yes,

1592
01:36:33.620 --> 01:36:38.210
I was in the Navy Jocko.
What did you do in the navy?
Well,
I,
okay,

1593
01:36:38.211 --> 01:36:39.044
I wasn't healed.

1594
01:36:40.100 --> 01:36:43.160
Whereas maybe at 19 year old kid who wants to be a seal will be like,

1595
01:36:43.170 --> 01:36:44.003
I'm going to be,
you know,

1596
01:36:44.120 --> 01:36:48.540
he's going to say it and a young fighter or someone who wants to be a fighters

1597
01:36:48.550 --> 01:36:52.190
can be like,
yeah,
you,
I'm a UFC fighter.
You get a really established fighter.

1598
01:36:52.191 --> 01:36:55.930
He's not going to usually say I'm a fighter.
I braked was arms and not,

1599
01:36:56.150 --> 01:36:56.983
it's not usually that way.

1600
01:36:57.050 --> 01:37:01.030
Also some of the richest people I know you wouldn't know the rich cause,

1601
01:37:01.640 --> 01:37:06.440
but I've met girls,
I dated girls who they have one nice dress.

1602
01:37:06.800 --> 01:37:08.200
They're poor as hell,
but it looked,

1603
01:37:08.201 --> 01:37:10.640
it looked like the rich were they going out there trying really hard to look

1604
01:37:10.641 --> 01:37:14.030
rich.
Right.
So it's interesting how,
how,

1605
01:37:14.031 --> 01:37:17.490
when when you understand things more,
it's like,
I don't think you have to,

1606
01:37:18.150 --> 01:37:21.290
it sounds corny.
Prove it.
I think you just,
you just,

1607
01:37:21.780 --> 01:37:25.160
you got a higher understanding about that.
The confrontational,
uh,

1608
01:37:25.530 --> 01:37:26.363
of human beings.

1609
01:37:26.530 --> 01:37:29.440
<v 0>I've talked about how when you roll with someone you've never rolled with,</v>

1610
01:37:29.441 --> 01:37:32.860
but where you meet someone and as soon as you make contact with them,

1611
01:37:33.190 --> 01:37:34.510
as soon as you clinch up with them,

1612
01:37:34.540 --> 01:37:36.560
you could tell something to tell him what's up and you can,

1613
01:37:36.590 --> 01:37:39.340
you can kind of tell like,
okay,
this is going to be,

1614
01:37:39.370 --> 01:37:41.500
this guy knows what he's doing this because this person doesn't really know

1615
01:37:41.501 --> 01:37:44.530
where they're okay.
Or wait a second,
I'm not 100% sure,

1616
01:37:44.531 --> 01:37:48.610
but I'm going to find out pretty quickly.
Members,
Sasha,
dude,

1617
01:37:48.880 --> 01:37:53.470
his aura was strong.
His Alicia was way strong.
He looked like Shrek.

1618
01:37:54.270 --> 01:37:56.190
Yeah,
no,
the ease,
Croatian straight east

1619
01:37:56.250 --> 01:37:57.000
<v 3>borough if,</v>

1620
01:37:57.000 --> 01:38:01.290
if you got Shrek and like took away his green skin but like a pill,

1621
01:38:02.160 --> 01:38:06.750
polar bear white skin on him.
It looks like a Shrek.
And he actually,

1622
01:38:06.780 --> 01:38:09.600
he wouldn't mind me saying this because no one really knows his full name.

1623
01:38:10.350 --> 01:38:15.120
He was quote hops main training partner and uh,
he,

1624
01:38:15.130 --> 01:38:17.040
he didn't speak English.
He speaks Spanish.

1625
01:38:17.100 --> 01:38:22.100
He served us some prison time in Spain for a felony,

1626
01:38:22.171 --> 01:38:23.004
let's say.
Okay.

1627
01:38:23.220 --> 01:38:25.990
And so we were talking in Spanish the whole time and he came to San Diego visit.

1628
01:38:26.010 --> 01:38:27.630
That's how you met him.
And that guy,

1629
01:38:28.470 --> 01:38:30.660
you know the first time I had trained with him at Cro cop's,

1630
01:38:30.670 --> 01:38:34.880
Jim hub has a gym under his house is full gym with a Cajun Sasha,

1631
01:38:34.960 --> 01:38:37.350
ways to 30 probably duties.

1632
01:38:37.370 --> 01:38:42.370
Kind of got his head on the size of this 25 at nine 10 you know,

1633
01:38:42.960 --> 01:38:45.360
and he has really good hands.
That guy's hardcore.

1634
01:38:45.510 --> 01:38:50.120
He was locked up with his head and his duty.
Come on,
he's,
he's just like,
yeah,

1635
01:38:51.460 --> 01:38:55.320
he's a great guy.
I don't think he and cro cop or in touch anymore.

1636
01:38:55.370 --> 01:38:58.770
I'm not really for some reason,
I mean core up don't talk so much anymore.

1637
01:38:59.190 --> 01:39:04.110
But he was the resident grappling guy slash coach training partner.

1638
01:39:04.320 --> 01:39:06.810
So I arrive and I'm like,
I'm kind of like the new guy.
Like hey this,

1639
01:39:07.070 --> 01:39:09.750
it looks at me.
And there was that little bit of like,
okay,

1640
01:39:09.751 --> 01:39:14.751
this is the new guy and we train and he got me in an well an arm lock behind the

1641
01:39:15.301 --> 01:39:19.890
head and I'm like,
I'm not tapping to this.
And I got an,
I got him and I'm like,

1642
01:39:19.950 --> 01:39:23.070
I should adapt to that because it was the first time,
you know,
I'm not going to,

1643
01:39:23.071 --> 01:39:24.960
I don't really.
Yeah.
And he was probably doing the same thing,

1644
01:39:25.350 --> 01:39:26.670
going to be real good friends.

1645
01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:30.900
He's a better wrestler than me and a better boxer than me and he has good

1646
01:39:30.901 --> 01:39:34.110
submissions,
but my in his head,
yeah,

1647
01:39:35.820 --> 01:39:39.360
you hit it.
Pardon me,
you hit his head can actually hurt your hand.

1648
01:39:40.420 --> 01:39:44.250
Actually he'll just take,
he won't even blink his eye.
He's really confident guy.

1649
01:39:44.251 --> 01:39:47.610
He's solid,
you know?
So you get some freaks like that.

1650
01:39:48.140 --> 01:39:50.310
Like a bowling ball of fury.
Yeah.

1651
01:39:50.640 --> 01:39:53.250
What should beginners focus on in Jujitsu?

1652
01:39:54.870 --> 01:39:59.870
Finding a good coach is imperative because you need some kind of direction and

1653
01:40:01.171 --> 01:40:05.280
in the end,
or hopefully sooner than later,
you start developing your own way.

1654
01:40:05.490 --> 01:40:09.480
Even if it's a little,
a little variation of what your coach is saying.
Uh,

1655
01:40:09.540 --> 01:40:12.570
maybe it doesn't have to be some champion.
Someone you connect with,

1656
01:40:12.580 --> 01:40:17.430
you not listening,
you can hear what they're saying because someone,
I might,

1657
01:40:17.760 --> 01:40:22.500
I might say something and on the dagger mom would say the same thing and the

1658
01:40:22.501 --> 01:40:27.480
slight variation,
it will make sense.
Maybe he says over me and vice versa.

1659
01:40:27.780 --> 01:40:30.240
I've had people both ways told me,
you know,

1660
01:40:30.270 --> 01:40:34.470
something that you will say made more sense or something that someone else said

1661
01:40:35.220 --> 01:40:37.230
the same exact thing,
but sending it if away.

1662
01:40:37.410 --> 01:40:41.580
So finding a coach is really important.
Uh,
also,
well,

1663
01:40:41.610 --> 01:40:46.290
humility will be taught by itself,
you know?
Um,
so that goes without saying.

1664
01:40:46.291 --> 01:40:49.950
I always tell people,
relax.
There we go.
Yeah,
of course.
Relax.
Of course.

1665
01:40:50.220 --> 01:40:54.010
But that's difficult for a beginner because you don't want to relax.

1666
01:40:54.010 --> 01:40:54.790
<v 0>You want to win.</v>

1667
01:40:54.790 --> 01:40:58.780
That's why I try and make it so evident that that's the most important thing you

1668
01:40:58.781 --> 01:41:01.450
should do.
You know,
a lot of people also ask me like,

1669
01:41:01.451 --> 01:41:05.920
what schools I live in Cleveland,
I live in Toledo.
What school should I go to?

1670
01:41:06.280 --> 01:41:09.700
And I think one thing that people should realize these days,

1671
01:41:10.390 --> 01:41:11.710
the days of like,
Hey,

1672
01:41:11.711 --> 01:41:14.710
there's some shyster that's running around saying he's a black belt.

1673
01:41:15.190 --> 01:41:19.420
There's not a lot of those guys left anymore because the data that as just

1674
01:41:19.600 --> 01:41:22.960
overtaken them and they just get called out.
So,

1675
01:41:23.080 --> 01:41:28.080
so I think if you go to a place that has a website that lists the instructors'

1676
01:41:29.621 --> 01:41:34.510
names,
the instructors maybe show some of their competitive history.

1677
01:41:34.690 --> 01:41:38.000
They show their lineage of where they got their black belt from Salt Lake.

1678
01:41:38.020 --> 01:41:40.360
You can't put that stuff on the Internet.
You can't say,

1679
01:41:40.361 --> 01:41:45.361
I got my black belt from wholesaler Gracie and not if you didn't,

1680
01:41:46.410 --> 01:41:49.510
and expect to have like expect to get away with that.

1681
01:41:49.600 --> 01:41:54.380
So do you know who Rafael Tory was?
He was a,
yeah.
So that's back to the day.

1682
01:41:54.670 --> 01:41:59.050
They were like,
yeah.
Um,
so you said I,
can you drive me out to the forest?

1683
01:41:59.051 --> 01:42:00.340
I have a to go to.

1684
01:42:00.520 --> 01:42:03.940
And they drove him out there and he got out with all this stuff and went the

1685
01:42:03.941 --> 01:42:08.100
forest and then came back like three hours later with like a trophy.
And then

1686
01:42:10.780 --> 01:42:14.420
Joe Rogan,
I was with a drug or Eddie Bravo and he's like,
yeah,
I beat 10 guys.

1687
01:42:14.800 --> 01:42:18.940
I'm paraphrasing by the way.
That guy was.
Yeah,
and he fixed fights.

1688
01:42:19.360 --> 01:42:22.860
It's like you fight a student.
It wasn't work.
It was a war 15 years ago.
Force.

1689
01:42:23.050 --> 01:42:24.950
He's in prison now.
It's gone.
So that guy,

1690
01:42:25.180 --> 01:42:30.180
this is an example of what it used to be like a guy could show up somewhere and

1691
01:42:30.750 --> 01:42:34.240
he put a black belt on and be like,
yeah,
I'm a,
I'm a,
I'm a black belt.

1692
01:42:34.240 --> 01:42:35.230
I got my black belt in Brazil.

1693
01:42:35.231 --> 01:42:38.830
I trained down there for four years and I'm a black belt and I won this and I

1694
01:42:38.831 --> 01:42:41.920
won that.
And he didn't win anything and he was just a liar.

1695
01:42:42.250 --> 01:42:45.750
But these days I'm telling you,
if you find a,

1696
01:42:46.150 --> 01:42:50.050
if you find a place online,
it lists the instructors,

1697
01:42:50.200 --> 01:42:53.560
the instructors names are there.
You can Google the instructors' names,

1698
01:42:53.561 --> 01:42:57.820
you can see if they've,
every instructor has competed at some point.
Right.

1699
01:42:57.821 --> 01:42:58.580
I mean if someone's,

1700
01:42:58.580 --> 01:43:02.590
I would say 95% of instructors have done some competition at some point.

1701
01:43:02.770 --> 01:43:07.660
There may be a few very small percentage of instructors that have never

1702
01:43:07.661 --> 01:43:11.470
competed.
Yeah.
I don't even know if that's possible.
If you've,

1703
01:43:11.530 --> 01:43:14.620
if you Google your instructor of your instructors never competed.

1704
01:43:14.680 --> 01:43:18.370
I would definitely be suspect possible.
But yeah,

1705
01:43:18.390 --> 01:43:22.840
it's not likely competition.
Like I said,
you could see how someone is the truth.

1706
01:43:22.970 --> 01:43:27.550
Yeah.
I would say one piece of advice I would give to people is,
okay,

1707
01:43:27.551 --> 01:43:30.790
I'm in Cleveland,
whatever,
or there's eight school.
Whenever five

1708
01:43:32.470 --> 01:43:36.370
go to each school.
Don't say you live there.
Say I'm visiting from yeah,

1709
01:43:36.371 --> 01:43:40.870
it's you're lying,
but it's wildlife.
Yeah.
It's okay.
God will forgive you.
You say,

1710
01:43:40.871 --> 01:43:44.260
hey listen,
I'm a,
I'm a white belt,
I'm from Florida.
I'm just passing through.

1711
01:43:44.261 --> 01:43:48.160
I have no experience.
So you're not getting the sales pitch.
You know,

1712
01:43:48.790 --> 01:43:51.900
the instructor was representative,
not his real self trying to press.

1713
01:43:52.190 --> 01:43:54.680
<v 3>So we signed a contract.
Signing a contract is okay,</v>

1714
01:43:54.740 --> 01:43:57.560
but if you believe in and the instructor you'd like we saying you like the

1715
01:43:57.561 --> 01:44:00.750
environment cause then as a visitor you're going to see like this,

1716
01:44:00.840 --> 01:44:03.290
this person not trying to sell me something.

1717
01:44:03.500 --> 01:44:06.380
You could see how that actually are and if you hear what they're saying is

1718
01:44:06.381 --> 01:44:07.700
making sense to you and you,

1719
01:44:07.820 --> 01:44:12.180
you vibe with the energy or let's say the style or the personality of the

1720
01:44:12.420 --> 01:44:15.920
instructor,
go to all five gyms in this,
pay the day fee,

1721
01:44:15.950 --> 01:44:20.950
2030 bucks and try it and then come back with which one did you like best and

1722
01:44:20.961 --> 01:44:22.280
then try it out.
And yes,

1723
01:44:22.370 --> 01:44:27.220
Jitsu is awesome because also you're not getting hit in the head.
Yeah.
You know,

1724
01:44:27.330 --> 01:44:31.070
and I love boxing.
Boxing.
Cute.
It's awesome.
I've done it at a high level of,

1725
01:44:31.071 --> 01:44:35.540
I've fought Wiltshire,
I sparred BOJ,
Ascii of Spark Co coppice Bart,

1726
01:44:35.870 --> 01:44:38.660
a gentleman,
the banner who's also one of the best in history from France.

1727
01:44:38.810 --> 01:44:40.280
That's why living in France for one month,

1728
01:44:40.610 --> 01:44:45.440
that's how I know it's a French you up,
you do get hit,

1729
01:44:45.470 --> 01:44:49.340
you get hurt and you only have one brain.
And it's not wrong.
It's not bad.

1730
01:44:49.580 --> 01:44:51.500
It's good to know everything.
A little bit of something.

1731
01:44:51.800 --> 01:44:54.890
But you can actually spar and Jujitsu without getting,

1732
01:44:55.970 --> 01:45:00.140
you can spar everyday base.
Yeah.
Unless you're injured.
Yeah.
So that the damage,

1733
01:45:00.170 --> 01:45:03.560
if you do get an unfortunate like any sport is distributed around your body,

1734
01:45:03.920 --> 01:45:08.870
which boxing,
it's mostly your brain.
So it's okay,

1735
01:45:08.871 --> 01:45:11.750
it's good to do all this stuff.
I mean I like it all.
Uh,

1736
01:45:11.751 --> 01:45:14.390
also grappling and assault defense scenario.

1737
01:45:14.391 --> 01:45:16.490
I mean even if it's more than one person,

1738
01:45:17.210 --> 01:45:19.470
the fact that someone cannot easily put me on the ground.

1739
01:45:19.490 --> 01:45:22.490
If two guys grabbed me actually like average guys,

1740
01:45:22.491 --> 01:45:26.060
I could actually probably just win the fight but what punch it,

1741
01:45:26.061 --> 01:45:27.770
but they're not going to take me down that easy.
Okay.

1742
01:45:27.900 --> 01:45:30.350
Someone grabs you from the side?
I can,
I could throw them,

1743
01:45:30.680 --> 01:45:32.510
I can get escape and I could leave.
Right.

1744
01:45:32.540 --> 01:45:34.100
That's something you said when it need a lot of sense.

1745
01:45:34.430 --> 01:45:38.780
If I decide I don't want to fight and you can't restrain me,
I could leave.
Yeah.

1746
01:45:39.370 --> 01:45:42.410
I don't have to.
Nowadays with all the lawsuits and stuff like that.

1747
01:45:42.440 --> 01:45:47.270
I mean just making a fist is ammunition for a lawyer.
That's,

1748
01:45:47.330 --> 01:45:50.450
that's a sign.
Okay.
Matter of fact,
he hits him with the open palm.

1749
01:45:50.480 --> 01:45:54.470
It's not a mini jurisdiction is not the same if you restrain someone.

1750
01:45:54.830 --> 01:45:57.520
If you had to,
and I,
and I call,
is it similar to that?

1751
01:45:57.590 --> 01:46:02.590
I say this is it a drunk uncle technique because if you had a wedding and your

1752
01:46:03.081 --> 01:46:06.380
uncles had too much to drink and every family has one of these uncles and

1753
01:46:06.381 --> 01:46:10.040
usually so they're like,
I understand what saying,
but you have to stop him.

1754
01:46:10.040 --> 01:46:12.320
He's doing something that's really the sea,
not,

1755
01:46:12.440 --> 01:46:16.460
not cool and he's hurting someone.
You could hold him without hurting him.

1756
01:46:17.080 --> 01:46:19.970
He can't do that with boxing.
Boxing is awesome,

1757
01:46:20.030 --> 01:46:23.690
but you're going to hurt someone or maybe not.
Uh,
and uh,

1758
01:46:23.930 --> 01:46:27.950
I know people who have hit people and fights,
the guy falls,

1759
01:46:27.980 --> 01:46:31.370
hits his head and dies.
I know people and they're in trouble.

1760
01:46:31.580 --> 01:46:35.540
And imagine your conscious,
how do you feel about that?
Does,
does so big?

1761
01:46:35.600 --> 01:46:40.110
It's all good to know.
San Diego does surf,
Kis are for kids.
Uh,

1762
01:46:40.370 --> 01:46:41.660
they knocked some kid out,

1763
01:46:41.900 --> 01:46:45.590
I heard about this and the guy who's not knocked him out as exactly that,

1764
01:46:45.591 --> 01:46:47.090
knocked him and punched him in the head and fell down,

1765
01:46:47.091 --> 01:46:49.980
hit his hand and curb died and,
and dude,
you don't went

1766
01:46:49.980 --> 01:46:52.860
<v 0>to prison,
so let's,
that's whatever,
manslaughter or murder.</v>

1767
01:46:53.520 --> 01:46:57.960
So whereas if he would have just done a double leg and choke the dude out,

1768
01:46:57.961 --> 01:47:01.080
which is more kind of more humiliating,
I think in a way

1769
01:47:02.850 --> 01:47:06.660
it's,
where am I?
Yeah.
I'm on the beach somewhere.
Yeah,

1770
01:47:07.570 --> 01:47:11.070
that's,
that's a good way to do it.
Uh,
so you find a good school.

1771
01:47:11.071 --> 01:47:13.890
I always think the proximity is important too.
Of course,
you know,

1772
01:47:14.100 --> 01:47:17.280
get something close to your,
if you've picked a school that's an hour away,

1773
01:47:17.281 --> 01:47:20.370
you're not going to go as often.
You're going to get struck John for your time.

1774
01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:24.900
Yeah.
Well,
I always,
you know,
we always picked schools that were,

1775
01:47:25.690 --> 01:47:30.630
there were two in San Diego County.
Yeah.
Yeah.
There's a ton and ton in San Diego.

1776
01:47:30.631 --> 01:47:33.780
They're all over the place though.
There's Jujitsu just goes everywhere.
You know.

1777
01:47:33.810 --> 01:47:38.810
I think we've done a pretty good job of being a political at our gym of just

1778
01:47:39.990 --> 01:47:44.760
look,
man.
Guess what?
We loved Jujitsu.
We loved the train Jujitsu.

1779
01:47:44.820 --> 01:47:47.280
We love to teach Jujitsu.
We love to roll Jujitsu.

1780
01:47:47.790 --> 01:47:52.110
If you fall into any of those categories,
come and train,

1781
01:47:52.200 --> 01:47:55.890
come and get it.
And we don't,
you know,
that's just kind of our attitude.

1782
01:47:55.960 --> 01:47:58.050
It was a quick,
quick story.
Chocolate,
you would appreciate it.

1783
01:47:58.110 --> 01:48:00.650
And I'm not gonna say his name because you know,
uh,

1784
01:48:01.350 --> 01:48:05.940
been training here for a few years.
Nice.
Nice guy actually came to me and said,

1785
01:48:06.300 --> 01:48:09.750
hey dean,
um,
I want you to know,
I really like training with you.
You're my coach.

1786
01:48:10.620 --> 01:48:13.350
But I was,
I was invited by hundred gov own for two months.

1787
01:48:13.351 --> 01:48:17.280
Come train with them for free,
you know,
said okay if I,
and I'm like,
yeah man.
It,

1788
01:48:17.790 --> 01:48:20.250
first of all,
most men wouldn't ask them.
You have that.

1789
01:48:20.410 --> 01:48:23.390
You would just go and do it.
The fact you asked me,
and I've thought,

1790
01:48:23.391 --> 01:48:27.210
he's a friend of mine,
I'm like,
and he,
he was like,
who's ray surprise?

1791
01:48:27.210 --> 01:48:30.720
He thought I was gonna be mad or something.
Um,
but if he,
if he,

1792
01:48:30.760 --> 01:48:33.150
she went and didn't say anything,
it will be a little awkward,

1793
01:48:33.390 --> 01:48:36.330
which has happened to us in the past and like someone does something weird and

1794
01:48:36.820 --> 01:48:40.830
um,
it's a little bit,
let's say not polite or not correct,
but that was,

1795
01:48:41.040 --> 01:48:43.920
would that be taking ownership of the problem in his mind?

1796
01:48:43.950 --> 01:48:47.250
He actually told me up front or asked me and I was like,
yeah,
right on.

1797
01:48:47.310 --> 01:48:49.650
It was good.
And I,
I wasn't lying either.

1798
01:48:49.830 --> 01:48:53.080
It wasn't me being like fake jealous and I was like,
hey,
he's a friend,

1799
01:48:53.340 --> 01:48:55.530
he's awesome.
He's a champion.
Go.
I said,

1800
01:48:55.531 --> 01:48:57.810
I don't want to use with a student and her friend,
I want you to come back.

1801
01:48:57.820 --> 01:49:02.280
He's like,
I'm coming back for sure.
And so yeah,
we're not political at all.
Yeah.

1802
01:49:02.281 --> 01:49:06.720
I was found that just like it's capitalistic system in my opinion.

1803
01:49:06.780 --> 01:49:09.920
It's like go train where you're going to get the best training of evil

1804
01:49:09.960 --> 01:49:14.610
capitalists,
evil capitalism,
and like,
oh you,
you,
you,
it's not

1805
01:49:16.350 --> 01:49:20.130
you train where you get the best training and now there's a level of loyalty,

1806
01:49:20.131 --> 01:49:20.791
right?
I mean,

1807
01:49:20.791 --> 01:49:25.470
you don't just bail on people that you've trained with for a long time and

1808
01:49:25.471 --> 01:49:28.440
there's a level of loyalty and that that's not like some level that you are

1809
01:49:28.441 --> 01:49:30.330
holding a gun to someone's head.
It's like,
man,

1810
01:49:30.331 --> 01:49:32.220
you're been trained with someone for a long time.

1811
01:49:32.221 --> 01:49:35.180
You keep training with them and you have a relationship with them,
you know,

1812
01:49:35.250 --> 01:49:38.340
and you don't just throw that out the window because you think someone else is

1813
01:49:38.341 --> 01:49:41.130
going to teach you a different mood for something.
It's not you.

1814
01:49:41.730 --> 01:49:45.660
That's not what I'm talking about.
Um,
but it is a capitalistic system.

1815
01:49:45.690 --> 01:49:47.770
So you go train,
where are you going to get training and,

1816
01:49:48.330 --> 01:49:50.770
<v 2>and that's the way I,
that's the way I feel about it.
Yeah.</v>

1817
01:49:50.771 --> 01:49:54.850
And I think if you're somewhat confident in your ability to save the environment

1818
01:49:54.851 --> 01:49:56.200
you create,
that you're a part of,

1819
01:49:56.910 --> 01:49:59.160
it's not so much about threat for someone to go train somewhere else.

1820
01:49:59.161 --> 01:50:02.500
Everyone's phone.
It's not a big deal.
That's why I'm like,
cool.
Yeah,
go.

1821
01:50:03.640 --> 01:50:08.290
It's fine.
Cause we know what we do here and other gyms.

1822
01:50:08.320 --> 01:50:10.930
It's like,
yeah,
right on.
Let's,
let's,
let's train.

1823
01:50:10.931 --> 01:50:15.860
Jujitsu is my overall philosophy of all this stuff.
I had a female friend,
um,

1824
01:50:16.380 --> 01:50:19.330
we're a pretty girl and we're about the same age.

1825
01:50:19.510 --> 01:50:23.470
She was one year older than me and her first real boyfriend,
I knew him too.

1826
01:50:23.471 --> 01:50:26.470
It wasn't real close to him.
He was very jealous and she,

1827
01:50:26.530 --> 01:50:28.570
I'm going to go up my car and the kid,
she would,

1828
01:50:28.571 --> 01:50:31.490
she's a while their girlfriends and he'd be bad and they'd make up the,

1829
01:50:31.520 --> 01:50:34.030
in the fights.
They broke up.
Eventually a few years later,

1830
01:50:34.031 --> 01:50:37.900
she actually dated a guy and he was,
he was a cop,
but he was like 28,

1831
01:50:38.080 --> 01:50:38.913
so she was 22,

1832
01:50:38.930 --> 01:50:43.930
28 year old guy hit a little more mature than the guys and straight to pull the

1833
01:50:44.891 --> 01:50:47.110
business with this guy.
She said,
I'm going to go up my girlfriends,
he went,

1834
01:50:47.111 --> 01:50:49.690
oh sure,
have a good time.
And she's okay.

1835
01:50:49.840 --> 01:50:51.840
She's trying to play this game with them actually.
So it wasn't,

1836
01:50:51.841 --> 01:50:54.880
it was equal back and forth game with proof,
proof of previous relationship.

1837
01:50:55.000 --> 01:50:58.300
And I know inside information that she was playing,
he was,
it was a game,

1838
01:50:58.301 --> 01:51:02.880
child's game.
And um,
she get ready and about to leave.

1839
01:51:02.881 --> 01:51:07.220
And I said,
hey,
listen,
um,
you know,
I like you to expand time with you.
But,
um,

1840
01:51:07.750 --> 01:51:11.130
I'm just saying,
I,
uh,
I had my own expectations and you know,

1841
01:51:11.170 --> 01:51:13.660
I don't really want to want to be with a girl who goes out all the time with her

1842
01:51:13.661 --> 01:51:17.380
girlfriends.
I mean,
have a good time,
go have a good time.
And she's like,
wait,

1843
01:51:18.580 --> 01:51:20.350
no,
I don't want to go out.
And she didn't go out.

1844
01:51:20.530 --> 01:51:23.740
So it's funny how he actually let her go out and she didn't go out the,
I said,

1845
01:51:23.741 --> 01:51:26.230
no,
I don't want you to out.
Shit went out of course.

1846
01:51:26.380 --> 01:51:29.470
And I'm not saying how to manipulate or quick,
that's,

1847
01:51:29.500 --> 01:51:32.770
that's some psychology there.
Would there be a dichotomy there?

1848
01:51:32.850 --> 01:51:36.550
A chance that a dichotomy?
I don't know.
I just felt,

1849
01:51:36.580 --> 01:51:40.720
I felt like saying that word one time today.
I don't know why I said No.

1850
01:51:40.721 --> 01:51:44.020
I said dichotomy a little too much.
But then another ego he asked me and I said,

1851
01:51:44.350 --> 01:51:46.550
by the way,
I wasn't playing again with him.
He wasn't playing together.

1852
01:51:46.551 --> 01:51:50.050
It was actually sincere.
I said right on man,
have a good time and do it.

1853
01:51:50.350 --> 01:51:52.030
It's a great training partner,
great Greek camp.

1854
01:51:52.031 --> 01:51:57.010
And I could see in his eyes he was very happy about the response.
So yeah,

1855
01:51:57.011 --> 01:52:00.040
I think that's uh,
taking ownership of the situation,
which is awesome.

1856
01:52:00.170 --> 01:52:02.840
It's good for sure.
Right on any,

1857
01:52:03.940 --> 01:52:06.430
I think we've been going two hours,
man.
Anything else?
Uh,

1858
01:52:07.090 --> 01:52:09.310
back when you were saying when used to train with Jocko

1859
01:52:11.920 --> 01:52:12.710
at Fabi is,

1860
01:52:12.710 --> 01:52:17.710
and you said he was the kind where if you guys were would roll out of bounds and

1861
01:52:17.801 --> 01:52:19.960
when you come back inbound,

1862
01:52:19.961 --> 01:52:24.961
what do you think he would want to reset or if I have let's say a x person so

1863
01:52:29.740 --> 01:52:34.570
and so and um,
I have the arm on the ground either Kimora halfway locked up.

1864
01:52:34.600 --> 01:52:38.140
We were a lot of balance and okay,
let go of it.

1865
01:52:38.590 --> 01:52:41.850
Average person wants to start where you don't have the keyboard golfing.
Yeah.

1866
01:52:42.030 --> 01:52:46.080
Chuck was like,
you had two arms on my,
on my army and I'm like,
whoa.
I know.

1867
01:52:46.080 --> 01:52:48.680
<v 4>I'm like,
no it wasn't.
No,
I had mama the ground.</v>

1868
01:52:48.681 --> 01:52:50.310
You've got two arms and all my called it cut.
Dammit.

1869
01:52:50.860 --> 01:52:55.280
What would to have the worst situation.
Most guys want to cheat kind of.

1870
01:52:56.090 --> 01:52:56.923
Yeah,
exactly.

1871
01:52:57.110 --> 01:53:00.860
I was the one doing the stuck of that because if you're super competitive in

1872
01:53:00.861 --> 01:53:04.610
training you'll pull that kind of stuff.
Like should I go now?
We'll pull not,

1873
01:53:04.730 --> 01:53:08.000
he won't cheat like that.
But Jack was a little more stingy.
Selfish.

1874
01:53:10.060 --> 01:53:12.440
I don't think I ever had that experience where you'd want to stay.

1875
01:53:12.500 --> 01:53:16.020
Or like if you,
if you'd be in an inferior position,
we go a bounce,

1876
01:53:16.180 --> 01:53:18.560
you got against the cage or something,
we'll restart.

1877
01:53:18.561 --> 01:53:21.260
And then you want to start like even Stevens.
I've never had that.

1878
01:53:21.440 --> 01:53:24.470
But the thing is people do that all the time.
All the time.
So I was wondering,

1879
01:53:24.500 --> 01:53:25.460
Oh maybe Jack was like

1880
01:53:27.770 --> 01:53:32.470
the other day and I wasn't.
I was like,
oh no,

1881
01:53:32.540 --> 01:53:34.400
I like,
we got close to the wall.
I don't know.

1882
01:53:34.401 --> 01:53:38.480
We got to close to another people that were rolling and I wasn't like a good

1883
01:53:38.481 --> 01:53:41.470
position.
I think I was actually a cross side and if I get across on you,
you,
you,

1884
01:53:41.480 --> 01:53:45.880
you know,
you've known and so and so we,
you know,

1885
01:53:45.950 --> 01:53:48.880
got a little close to these other people and,
and you know,
like,

1886
01:53:48.890 --> 01:53:50.700
well their foot hit hit him or something.

1887
01:53:50.950 --> 01:53:54.890
Say we get it move and then he likes kneels down.

1888
01:53:55.490 --> 01:53:58.970
And I was like,
okay,
but here's the thing.
Okay.
So here's the thing.

1889
01:53:59.000 --> 01:54:01.380
Let's say someone does that to you.
What's the rule in your mind?

1890
01:54:01.381 --> 01:54:04.850
I'm sure you were actually mentally in their head.

1891
01:54:04.851 --> 01:54:09.360
Now are you allowed to say,
hey,
no,
I w I had no or right hand,

1892
01:54:09.950 --> 01:54:14.900
but it's more critical and that's the equivalent of trying to have,

1893
01:54:14.901 --> 01:54:18.770
trying to be like,
oh no,
you didn't have my arm all the way there.
That's cool.

1894
01:54:19.070 --> 01:54:21.480
That's fine.
By the way,

1895
01:54:23.170 --> 01:54:27.040
stuff just escalate mental notes.
You can't say,

1896
01:54:27.710 --> 01:54:31.640
I don't know how many of these themes I have,
like I had just finished.

1897
01:54:31.641 --> 01:54:34.780
Whether that's a cool for a minute sweater,
like I was just,

1898
01:54:34.920 --> 01:54:37.690
I don't know why it just crazy themes,
which I'll cope and it

1899
01:54:39.530 --> 01:54:44.240
smack talking themes.
We'll get he,
he does like,
excuse me,

1900
01:54:44.241 --> 01:54:45.970
when I heard there were hills,

1901
01:54:46.520 --> 01:54:51.290
be a Venezuelan soccer player or

1902
01:54:55.550 --> 01:54:59.780
I'll talk him with an accent,
but here's like,
oh man,
on geography,
like chocolate.

1903
01:54:59.840 --> 01:55:03.740
If you want,
I'll just get up and you can,
it's okay.
It's all right.

1904
01:55:03.741 --> 01:55:06.920
Just let just tell me Dean and Jack would be like,

1905
01:55:08.960 --> 01:55:12.830
I did it other guys before if you want me to.
Yeah,
thanks.
I'm like,
what?

1906
01:55:13.550 --> 01:55:18.370
I said it now.
I'm like,
I lost my mouth,
Bro.
I'm like,

1907
01:55:18.560 --> 01:55:20.820
actually they don't joke in the,
I'm joking.
Right.

1908
01:55:20.930 --> 01:55:22.650
What are the best psychological warfare you,

1909
01:55:22.670 --> 01:55:26.210
they don't mean it was like when you acted like you didn't want to train but you

1910
01:55:26.211 --> 01:55:27.560
were actually fired up because I had,

1911
01:55:27.800 --> 01:55:29.750
I had kinda gotten the best to you the day before.

1912
01:55:29.751 --> 01:55:32.450
I think it was a morning or something.
I was in the morning and you're like,
yeah,

1913
01:55:32.451 --> 01:55:35.120
I don't know.
And you're like,
I got to go soon.
And I was like,

1914
01:55:35.410 --> 01:55:38.510
in my mind I'm thinking,
okay cool.
I'll just get a quick round,
you know,

1915
01:55:38.540 --> 01:55:43.540
five minute round,
no big deal.
And then he was all in the game.
So Hema,

1916
01:55:43.580 --> 01:55:43.980
ma'am,

1917
01:55:43.980 --> 01:55:44.910
<v 2>were you there that day?</v>

1918
01:55:45.600 --> 01:55:49.320
He mounted me for like 30 to 30 minutes and was torturing me.

1919
01:55:49.780 --> 01:55:52.080
Well that's all the snow angel,
the whole nine yards.

1920
01:55:52.310 --> 01:55:57.210
Was it water torture of Chinese water torture and with the drips of sweat in my

1921
01:55:57.210 --> 01:56:01.910
year,
that left a mark,
that one,
one of those,
it's really jacked up though.

1922
01:56:01.911 --> 01:56:04.770
He's really jacked up that I'm a grown man.

1923
01:56:06.120 --> 01:56:10.110
I trained Jujitsu on a regular basis.
I work out,

1924
01:56:10.620 --> 01:56:12.150
I eat good food.

1925
01:56:13.020 --> 01:56:18.020
And yet you dean lister can't get a position on me that I can't get out of.

1926
01:56:20.100 --> 01:56:24.960
That's not cool man.
I don't like that.
You have your days too by the way.

1927
01:56:24.990 --> 01:56:27.850
You smack talk sometimes too.
You do the arrest them.

1928
01:56:27.870 --> 01:56:31.200
You did that to me sometimes,
but that's the retaliation.
It's retaliatory.

1929
01:56:32.780 --> 01:56:37.650
There are,
you have,
you have three positions you can get on me and crushed me.

1930
01:56:37.750 --> 01:56:42.090
I have to cross side and mount.
Yes.
And I have to,
I keep money.

1931
01:56:42.120 --> 01:56:45.090
I used to have get the back.
I got hold on you now.
I really can't hold it

1932
01:56:46.690 --> 01:56:47.400
but uh,

1933
01:56:47.400 --> 01:56:52.400
but I only have two so I can only talk smack in two positions and it's for all.

1934
01:56:53.520 --> 01:56:58.290
Yeah.
So interesting.
Uh,
element of you're smack talking as well.

1935
01:56:58.620 --> 01:57:01.370
Sometimes it,
it'll transcend the mets.

1936
01:57:01.380 --> 01:57:05.370
Like you can go home and get voicemails.
Oh yeah.
Oh

1937
01:57:08.480 --> 01:57:09.313
really?
Interesting.

1938
01:57:12.420 --> 01:57:15.120
I used to just spam is for them.

1939
01:57:16.200 --> 01:57:21.010
I send like videos or pictures.
Um,
man,
one of the funniest ones to like,

1940
01:57:21.011 --> 01:57:24.400
you didn't do this
earlier today.

1941
01:57:25.610 --> 01:57:28.470
This is just kind of unique.
I don't know why and my comment or some weird today,

1942
01:57:29.100 --> 01:57:30.200
I was feeling good though.
I'm like,
I'm a,

1943
01:57:30.210 --> 01:57:32.250
I'm going to fuck with chuck was head and I'm like,

1944
01:57:32.490 --> 01:57:35.250
I can take a position and I would call it 22.5

1945
01:57:37.040 --> 01:57:39.660
and I'd take it out and

1946
01:57:43.810 --> 01:57:48.100
I'm like,
no comment.
I'm like 99.3 and it's

1947
01:57:49.700 --> 01:57:53.190
gotta be something in your head like,
what's he doing?
I,

1948
01:57:53.400 --> 01:57:55.040
I completely turned to your,

1949
01:57:55.680 --> 01:57:59.220
your volume off and I put you on mute in my head.

1950
01:57:59.221 --> 01:58:03.060
But that was what accent is the most annoying for you?
Um,

1951
01:58:04.020 --> 01:58:08.670
man,
I dunno.
I Dunno what this way the Russians pretty good.

1952
01:58:08.810 --> 01:58:10.930
The Russians at the mouth and you come up to skip

1953
01:58:13.090 --> 01:58:17.580
or Arnold or whatever.
It's just,
yeah.
But yeah,
he gets,

1954
01:58:17.581 --> 01:58:20.690
gets used to it.
Yeah,
it doesn't,
it doesn't impact them too much psy ops to,

1955
01:58:20.750 --> 01:58:24.150
well that's my Syapse is I try not to show any reaction whatsoever.

1956
01:58:24.300 --> 01:58:28.530
It's actually funny.
Dave Burke was watching.
Good deal.
Good deal.

1957
01:58:28.531 --> 01:58:33.531
Dave [inaudible] was watching Andy and I roll and he afterwards he was like,

1958
01:58:33.781 --> 01:58:34.410
you know,

1959
01:58:34.410 --> 01:58:38.910
it was cool to watch your role because first of all like it didn't even look

1960
01:58:38.911 --> 01:58:42.220
like anything I've been training.
Right.

1961
01:58:42.250 --> 01:58:47.140
<v 0>Cause you guys were just getting crazy.
And he goes and I saw,</v>

1962
01:58:47.230 --> 01:58:47.890
uh,

1963
01:58:47.890 --> 01:58:52.890
I saw like emotion or I saw facial emotions on you.

1964
01:58:54.100 --> 01:58:54.940
And I was like,
what do you mean?
He's like,

1965
01:58:54.941 --> 01:58:58.690
you'd normally just look like the same all the time.

1966
01:58:58.960 --> 01:59:01.600
And then when you're training or when I was training I'll share it with Andy,

1967
01:59:01.601 --> 01:59:03.730
Andy all I was like,
you know,

1968
01:59:03.970 --> 01:59:07.780
some taste is crap and trying to move and all that.
And uh,

1969
01:59:08.320 --> 01:59:11.470
so yeah,
that's one of those things.
It's one of those things,

1970
01:59:11.471 --> 01:59:16.471
that's why I know that whatever I'm doing is micro successful when you increase

1971
01:59:17.831 --> 01:59:21.100
your sense of urgency because you're all normal faith the whole time.

1972
01:59:21.580 --> 01:59:23.090
Even when she was my face,
normal face north.

1973
01:59:23.770 --> 01:59:26.820
And then occasionally you make me scramble a little bit

1974
01:59:28.320 --> 01:59:30.340
cause you can't,
that's the thing,
you know,

1975
01:59:30.341 --> 01:59:35.140
you're getting to a point where I can't just allow some little,

1976
01:59:35.890 --> 01:59:40.060
some little situation to occur because I can go to,
it's like the,
the,
uh,

1977
01:59:41.440 --> 01:59:46.110
the event horizon on a black hole.
Like,
Oh,
if I let this,

1978
01:59:46.111 --> 01:59:49.090
it's done.
Yeah.
If I let this go,
it's going,
it's going to go.

1979
01:59:50.320 --> 01:59:53.980
And the better you get,
the,

1980
01:59:54.640 --> 01:59:58.210
the more I got to pay attention to where that event horizon to make sure I don't

1981
01:59:58.211 --> 02:00:01.180
get myself in a situation where,
you know,
we've got a problem.

1982
02:00:02.030 --> 02:00:06.600
<v 3>You want to hear an Echo Charles Story.
So I,
uh,
yeah,
I,</v>

1983
02:00:06.670 --> 02:00:10.410
I expect talk to you a little bit.
Not,
not the same extreme as chocolate,

1984
02:00:10.411 --> 02:00:13.950
but last time we was the last time maybe,
and I'm like,

1985
02:00:14.910 --> 02:00:17.930
I didn't let you pass,
but I was kind of like waxy days go like,
oh he's cross.

1986
02:00:17.960 --> 02:00:22.520
And I went,
hey,
echo,
here's my arm.
And usually he's like,
there's something wrong.

1987
02:00:22.530 --> 02:00:25.140
Like it's a trap.
And usually there is a trap.

1988
02:00:25.440 --> 02:00:29.430
I was just talking smack and echoes like,
Oh okay,

1989
02:00:30.300 --> 02:00:34.650
I'll take that arm.
And I'm like,
God dammit.
He called my bullshit,
you know,

1990
02:00:36.090 --> 02:00:37.190
because most guys go,
there's something,

1991
02:00:37.260 --> 02:00:40.420
there's some reason that he's given me the arm,
you know,
and you're like,

1992
02:00:40.450 --> 02:00:45.210
yeah that was just going to give me an arm.
Like this is a trap.
But I knew that,

1993
02:00:45.211 --> 02:00:45.520
you know like,

1994
02:00:45.520 --> 02:00:50.230
cause you were talking smack the whole time we were rolling the whole time.
Yeah.

1995
02:00:50.990 --> 02:00:55.040
<v 0>22 it's funny that for anyone that's listening that thinks that dean might be</v>

1996
02:00:55.041 --> 02:00:58.790
this big smack talker.
The funny thing is is that you own the only,

1997
02:00:59.700 --> 02:01:03.560
yeah,
my friend actually a lot of times when you teach moves,
you're like,

1998
02:01:03.740 --> 02:01:07.520
this is a move that you would only do to someone that's very good friend of

1999
02:01:07.521 --> 02:01:09.320
yours or someone that you hate,

2000
02:01:10.100 --> 02:01:13.290
which is really kind of jacked up if you think about it.
Like,

2001
02:01:13.670 --> 02:01:18.530
oh he doesn't mind grinding his elbow into my temple for three or my ribs

2002
02:01:18.950 --> 02:01:21.980
because,
cause I'm as broke allegedly.
And so he,

2003
02:01:21.981 --> 02:01:23.630
but he won't do it to someone who doesn't really know that well,

2004
02:01:23.631 --> 02:01:26.360
because that wouldn't be,
you know,
that's not cool.
But if you,

2005
02:01:26.361 --> 02:01:29.430
if he hated me or if he was friends with me,
they need,

2006
02:01:29.550 --> 02:01:31.790
then I'm going to elbows to the ribs when he's trying to come near me.

2007
02:01:31.820 --> 02:01:36.050
That's awesome.
Well,
and really when you really think about it,

2008
02:01:36.051 --> 02:01:40.070
you're smack talking is never ever like serious.
Oh yeah.
And

2009
02:01:40.080 --> 02:01:42.320
<v 2>it's never like the greatest new store.</v>

2010
02:01:42.321 --> 02:01:47.060
It's not that it's all your Arnold impressions or your police man or you know,

2011
02:01:47.061 --> 02:01:49.370
all these,
all these things.
It's all like literally jokes,

2012
02:01:49.371 --> 02:01:52.820
but the jokes just to kind of think they're not always that funny when it's

2013
02:01:52.821 --> 02:01:55.730
occurring to you.
That's the genius of it though.
You see what I'm saying?

2014
02:01:56.550 --> 02:02:01.510
I love when the tables turn,
oh,
when the tables turn,
if you're,

2015
02:02:01.600 --> 02:02:05.030
if you're talking smack and I can get the tables to turn,
Oh man,

2016
02:02:05.090 --> 02:02:07.240
that's when I have no mercy.
It's,

2017
02:02:07.250 --> 02:02:12.150
it's gotta be shocking to some people were either one of us,
you and training,

2018
02:02:12.950 --> 02:02:13.783
you're going

2019
02:02:15.890 --> 02:02:20.480
to wall to wall and I'm like,
oh,
this is awesome.

2020
02:02:20.720 --> 02:02:25.060
The two you do it.
And like in reprisal to me are the,

2021
02:02:25.260 --> 02:02:29.530
the cop you did that.
But in like revenge,
like if he gets it like,
all right sir,

2022
02:02:29.540 --> 02:02:34.450
I'm like,
cut.
Dammit you're mine.
You're in the wrong neighborhood today.
I'm like,

2023
02:02:34.580 --> 02:02:37.730
God dammit.
I want to get out of this neighborhood is not cool.

2024
02:02:38.090 --> 02:02:41.880
And he also do the,
I'll do it too.
I'll start,
I'll light the fire.

2025
02:02:42.940 --> 02:02:47.240
Oh,
that's your guy here.
I'll do like bad Brazilian accent.

2026
02:02:47.570 --> 02:02:50.360
And when he got on top you're like,
oh,
oh,
you do it back to me.
I'm like,

2027
02:02:50.361 --> 02:02:52.760
God dammit.
I don't like your,
I don't want to help you with something.

2028
02:02:52.780 --> 02:02:56.780
Like I want to reverse to where it was
horrible.

2029
02:02:56.870 --> 02:02:59.750
It wasn't your tooth right on man.
Well,
like I said,

2030
02:02:59.751 --> 02:03:04.630
we've been going for a little over two hours.
So Dean,

2031
02:03:04.631 --> 02:03:06.940
anything else?
Not just a eight.

2032
02:03:07.180 --> 02:03:10.850
My Bros here and that would have victory in Maine.
You know,
like Jack who said,

2033
02:03:10.851 --> 02:03:15.280
yeah,
I mean there's been some rough times and yeah,
some,

2034
02:03:15.820 --> 02:03:20.200
some,
some unique things that I'd been through.
And you know,
that's how,
you know,

2035
02:03:20.201 --> 02:03:23.560
you have a real pro,
a real team stick by my side and it'll help me actually,

2036
02:03:23.561 --> 02:03:28.090
you know,
if I can help them as well.
I know they know that,
you know,
my dad,

2037
02:03:28.120 --> 02:03:32.680
he actually,
you know,
did not bring him easy.
Not saying he would,

2038
02:03:32.740 --> 02:03:35.260
he was a real good dad,
but he,
you know,

2039
02:03:35.261 --> 02:03:38.860
I know it's not popular to say this nowadays,
but it may be tough.
I mean,

2040
02:03:39.280 --> 02:03:43.990
you know,
uh,
hey,
you got to fight.
He did you fight hard?
Did he fight hard?
Not,
Oh,

2041
02:03:43.991 --> 02:03:47.540
poor you.
Oh,
you know,
we're going to,
we're going to make a complaint and all,

2042
02:03:47.770 --> 02:03:51.610
I'm not making some statements saying my dad was awesome or marine.
Right.

2043
02:03:51.611 --> 02:03:55.850
Didn't you say that if you weren't a seal?
We marine,
we were saying,
someone said,

2044
02:03:55.870 --> 02:03:59.290
I'd say there's a really good percentage that if I didn't join the seal teams,

2045
02:03:59.291 --> 02:04:02.710
I would've gone to the Marine Corps.
Yeah.
That's it.
That's a pretty good,
yeah,

2046
02:04:02.740 --> 02:04:06.400
pretty good assessment.
Yes.
My Dad was kind of like,
how you raise the war?

2047
02:04:06.490 --> 02:04:10.650
Like you know you're going to do this and,
and yeah,
you don't force the war,

2048
02:04:10.840 --> 02:04:14.860
but you kind of encourage him to do certain things.
And that's how my dad was.

2049
02:04:14.890 --> 02:04:19.180
That's another little torture that you do with thorough with my son.
With a,

2050
02:04:19.830 --> 02:04:24.100
I don't know why I go.
Um,
I don't know why.
I just go,
hey Thor,

2051
02:04:24.110 --> 02:04:27.360
what's her favorite food?
And he'll go like,
oh,
steak.
I'll be,
no,

2052
02:04:31.580 --> 02:04:34.490
I'll throw him down and I'll be like,
piggies in a blanket.
He's like,
no,
it's not.

2053
02:04:35.330 --> 02:04:37.050
Say No.
No.
Say it.

2054
02:04:39.000 --> 02:04:43.680
<v 3>It'll go say,
hey,
he's on a bike.
And they'll be like,
no.
Okay.</v>

2055
02:04:43.681 --> 02:04:48.150
Pig is on back.
No,
sorry.
It's torture him.
Where did you come from?

2056
02:04:48.180 --> 02:04:50.190
No idea.
It's just something I thought.

2057
02:04:50.200 --> 02:04:55.170
Of course I have no idea why it just pick a theme.

2058
02:04:55.910 --> 02:04:59.400
And then the fourth time he was like,
all right,
take it.
Oh my God,

2059
02:04:59.401 --> 02:05:00.234
you said it correctly.

2060
02:05:00.390 --> 02:05:03.180
So you earned the privilege of letting me like coffee right now.

2061
02:05:05.080 --> 02:05:08.040
That's a Siop.
All brothers got to do that.
You know?
It's just the way it is.

2062
02:05:08.130 --> 02:05:09.810
That's how it is,
man.
That's how it is.

2063
02:05:09.840 --> 02:05:12.830
One day the pecking order will be reversed,
right?
Yeah.
I know.

2064
02:05:12.831 --> 02:05:15.150
I was talking to me now.
I know.
Well,
I saw you.
You,

2065
02:05:15.151 --> 02:05:17.700
you went to take him down or whatever it was the first time you actually

2066
02:05:17.701 --> 02:05:20.520
definitive mocad days defending him saying,
I went to double.

2067
02:05:20.521 --> 02:05:24.360
They come like he actually said he's wrong.
And I was like,
Oh yeah,

2068
02:05:24.361 --> 02:05:25.194
I had to turn up the heat.

2069
02:05:25.890 --> 02:05:28.500
<v 4>Awesome man.
Well,
uh,
echo,
it looks like,</v>

2070
02:05:28.501 --> 02:05:31.470
I think everyone's going to be training Jujitsu now.

2071
02:05:32.550 --> 02:05:34.530
Everyone is going to get on that path.

2072
02:05:34.710 --> 02:05:37.620
How can we get on that path to stay on that path,
you know?
Yeah.

2073
02:05:38.130 --> 02:05:41.920
I'll let you like that.
Yeah.
So you get to,
if you do G,

2074
02:05:41.921 --> 02:05:44.220
which we recommend,
we recommend

2075
02:05:47.660 --> 02:05:51.240
you get an origin Gig,
get Orenstein hundred percent.
No,
you didn't even have to.

2076
02:05:52.010 --> 02:05:54.750
Are those the ones that don't rip at all or something like that?
Oh,

2077
02:05:54.780 --> 02:05:58.380
I don't know that they rip.
I've never seen witnessed one rip ever.

2078
02:05:58.500 --> 02:06:02.340
I've never witnessed one even come close to ripping or even having the sound of

2079
02:06:02.341 --> 02:06:05.310
ripping sounds.
Oh by the way,
that's an investment because Jocko,

2080
02:06:05.311 --> 02:06:08.240
how many keys have we gone through?
Like a lot of days.
Yeah.

2081
02:06:08.540 --> 02:06:13.320
So I've ripped someone's Geek in a match by the ladder.
Hey,
awesome.

2082
02:06:14.630 --> 02:06:16.010
I think you taught me that.
Anyway,

2083
02:06:16.020 --> 02:06:20.130
get origin g that's the made all made in America from the thread from the cotton

2084
02:06:20.820 --> 02:06:24.210
all the way to the actual [inaudible] all made in America.
Assembled in America.

2085
02:06:24.240 --> 02:06:29.040
And also if you're going to train Nogi yeah.
Which we also recommend right?

2086
02:06:29.480 --> 02:06:33.060
Fully.
So you can get a a rash guard,

2087
02:06:33.360 --> 02:06:38.360
which is very good for training Jujitsu with cause it's compression and it

2088
02:06:38.851 --> 02:06:43.830
doesn't get caught up toes,
fingers,
fingers.
So you can get that.
That's true.

2089
02:06:44.250 --> 02:06:48.810
The rash guards and they are also made a hundred percent in an America.

2090
02:06:49.960 --> 02:06:54.240
Where we go is,
where are you guys?
Online origin main.com.

2091
02:06:54.300 --> 02:06:58.380
It's in Maine.
Um,
and yeah,
you can get sweats,
shirts,
you know,

2092
02:06:58.740 --> 02:07:03.670
lifestyle stuff,
apparel,
real cool stuff,
lifestyle stuff.
I said,
okay,

2093
02:07:04.050 --> 02:07:07.350
we'll leave that one with that.
His lifestyle bread.
Do you get to trends?
Sands,

2094
02:07:07.351 --> 02:07:11.340
the maps.
Once you find the way broadly,
you see it in all things.

2095
02:07:11.700 --> 02:07:13.320
You see what I'm saying?
I don't think I see that.

2096
02:07:13.350 --> 02:07:15.000
I don't think I see the way in John.

2097
02:07:15.030 --> 02:07:19.020
I'm just saying it's going to be your lifestyle is what I'm saying.

2098
02:07:19.050 --> 02:07:21.480
You see what I'm saying?
You'd knows what I'm saying.
Hunting.
Oh yeah,

2099
02:07:21.660 --> 02:07:25.910
there you go.
Boom.
Also supplements.
Okay.
Jocko had supplements.
Good News,
Jocko.

2100
02:07:25.940 --> 02:07:29.250
Supplements.
You had a surgery on your shoulders.
Same Day.

2101
02:07:29.251 --> 02:07:33.060
I had surgery by the way.
Actually.
Thanks for four.
He gave me,

2102
02:07:33.061 --> 02:07:36.970
he'll be out with some,
some gear.
Oh,
cure what?
Joint warfare patient.
Yes.
Yeah,

2103
02:07:36.971 --> 02:07:40.030
so that's going to help you see like mine is waived.
Remember Kay,

2104
02:07:40.031 --> 02:07:44.450
I did my other side to my buy side.
This one's healing way faster.
Ignite and day.

2105
02:07:44.451 --> 02:07:46.810
Wait,
crazy faster.
Anyway,
joint warfare,

2106
02:07:46.990 --> 02:07:51.180
so supplements Jocko has thankfully joint warfare.

2107
02:07:51.240 --> 02:07:55.240
Glucosomine can Jordan,
you know grappling,
we always kind of knew about that.

2108
02:07:55.690 --> 02:08:00.130
The crow,
curcumin and then also Jocko.
Super Krill oil,

2109
02:08:00.460 --> 02:08:04.660
which is good for your joints.
The joints,
lubrication,
Omega threes.

2110
02:08:04.750 --> 02:08:08.620
What not other good benefits for that too.
And you can get disciplined.

2111
02:08:09.940 --> 02:08:13.870
Yeah.
Not just regular discipline,
but a supplement called discipline,

2112
02:08:14.410 --> 02:08:19.000
which is good for the pre mission situation.

2113
02:08:19.780 --> 02:08:24.580
Dave Burke.
Good deal.
Deal deal.
Dave,
he's on the discipline.

2114
02:08:24.730 --> 02:08:28.810
Yeah,
a lot.
So here's the thing about discipline going to sick k.
So I'm like,

2115
02:08:28.811 --> 02:08:32.950
all right,
that's not an every day deal for me.
Discipline.
Oh.
So I'm like,
oh no,

2116
02:08:32.951 --> 02:08:36.520
I'll take it.
You know.
Cool.
I'm down.
Um,
so I'm like,
all right,

2117
02:08:36.521 --> 02:08:39.180
so let me do the three.
Oh,
you didn't hear,

2118
02:08:39.270 --> 02:08:43.000
I heard some good things about the three scoops.
So I did the three scoops and,

2119
02:08:43.320 --> 02:08:46.180
and here's the thing,
I wasn't like tired or nothing like that.
It wasn't like,
oh,

2120
02:08:46.181 --> 02:08:48.460
I need this specific label.
Let me just do the three scoops.

2121
02:08:48.520 --> 02:08:52.060
Good for your program.
A little bit of this,
got to do it.

2122
02:08:52.061 --> 02:08:54.220
So I get in three schools,
boom.

2123
02:08:54.430 --> 02:08:57.360
I go and here's one thing that like,

2124
02:08:57.860 --> 02:09:01.000
I wasn't necessarily trying to pay attention to him.

2125
02:09:01.001 --> 02:09:02.200
I remember everything and my sharp,

2126
02:09:02.201 --> 02:09:04.090
I wasn't trying to really paying attention to that.

2127
02:09:04.091 --> 02:09:06.100
I was just going to take it and be like,
okay,
what happens?

2128
02:09:06.340 --> 02:09:08.290
This is what I noticed what stuck out to me.

2129
02:09:08.510 --> 02:09:13.420
My patients like you don't want to increase in increase in life.

2130
02:09:13.450 --> 02:09:15.000
So like you,

2131
02:09:15.040 --> 02:09:19.460
you might think that your patients would go down because you're all here but you

2132
02:09:19.490 --> 02:09:21.100
don't get that.
But it's not,
it's,

2133
02:09:21.101 --> 02:09:24.850
I mean it's slightly caffeinated and like her dose of caffeine but it's not,
no,

2134
02:09:24.851 --> 02:09:29.750
like maybe maybe caffeine might make you like that.
Maybe,
but um,

2135
02:09:30.030 --> 02:09:31.330
cause it's not that I don't,

2136
02:09:31.331 --> 02:09:35.530
I don't know what the mechanism is that made me patient,
but I really,

2137
02:09:35.531 --> 02:09:37.660
you know how like through the day you'll get,
you know,
it'll get tested.

2138
02:09:37.660 --> 02:09:42.280
Things won't go your way or whatever.
I felt like,
Oh man,
it's all good.
Like man,

2139
02:09:42.281 --> 02:09:46.870
I'm problem solving.
And in there that's giving you emotional discipline.
Yeah.

2140
02:09:46.871 --> 02:09:47.531
Like it's like,

2141
02:09:47.531 --> 02:09:52.531
it's like making my mind like PR solve problems rather than like be all,

2142
02:09:52.990 --> 02:09:55.510
you know,
you have little micro reaction.
The inside internally.

2143
02:09:55.511 --> 02:09:57.700
I mean I'm not a bad behavior.
You're cute.
What

2144
02:10:00.070 --> 02:10:02.920
it felt like I could manage that like really good.

2145
02:10:02.980 --> 02:10:05.590
It was like really easy to manage that.
That's what it felt like.

2146
02:10:05.800 --> 02:10:08.770
The on the three schools that,
that's my three scoops.
That's what happened.
Boom.

2147
02:10:08.970 --> 02:10:10.970
Either way,
discipline,
Moke

2148
02:10:13.720 --> 02:10:15.030
biking or something like,

2149
02:10:15.260 --> 02:10:20.260
it's actually a word that I literally created to make something and I was like,

2150
02:10:22.110 --> 02:10:22.511
hey man,

2151
02:10:22.511 --> 02:10:27.511
this has to taste really good and it has to have a great profile nutritionally.

2152
02:10:28.630 --> 02:10:29.380
And when we,

2153
02:10:29.380 --> 02:10:34.380
when I finally got the sample where I wanted and Pete and Brian McCall,

2154
02:10:35.471 --> 02:10:39.080
he got so good and they sent me my idols like oh it's so good.
And I'm thinking,

2155
02:10:39.081 --> 02:10:44.000
well it's not even a protein drink.
It's something else.
It's milk,

2156
02:10:45.160 --> 02:10:47.010
but it is so it's just a word,

2157
02:10:48.530 --> 02:10:53.530
but it happens to have 22 grams of protein in one's curse group and taste like,

2158
02:10:53.750 --> 02:10:56.540
like a for rest probiotics or something too.
It has probiotics

2159
02:11:00.490 --> 02:11:04.100
and peanut butter.
Chocolate is now also available.

2160
02:11:04.340 --> 02:11:08.200
It's a big hit in my household.
Brought mine too man.

2161
02:11:09.050 --> 02:11:12.740
It's fun.
That's all I had to eat today by the way.
I had,
I had milk,

2162
02:11:12.790 --> 02:11:16.460
a triple milkshake milk.
Put some heavy cream in there too.
Not a lot.

2163
02:11:16.461 --> 02:11:20.960
It's a little bit.
And then um,
oh,

2164
02:11:20.961 --> 02:11:24.990
I know I had a worrier bar too,
but that's all I had to pry him on a mock train.

2165
02:11:25.040 --> 02:11:27.080
Big told.
It's like,

2166
02:11:27.081 --> 02:11:31.850
it's like a protein supplement and a dessert.
So if you're like,
Hey,
I'm lifting,

2167
02:11:31.970 --> 02:11:36.740
I'm rolling.
Um,
working out hard,
you eat dinner,
you can have a dessert.
Boom.

2168
02:11:36.770 --> 02:11:39.470
That's a protein supplement,
right?
The

2169
02:11:41.440 --> 02:11:45.590
not,
okay.
The Mint is delicious,

2170
02:11:45.950 --> 02:11:50.420
but let's face it,
I've been drinking nothing but men milk for whatever.

2171
02:11:50.421 --> 02:11:52.490
How ever long it's been released for.

2172
02:11:53.070 --> 02:11:57.830
So now all of a sudden I've got a little option.
Yeah,
the new and it's new.

2173
02:11:58.830 --> 02:12:03.620
It is new,
but it's awesome
when you open,
here's what I'll tell you what,

2174
02:12:03.621 --> 02:12:07.580
when you open up either one of those two and you smell them,
you know,
you know,

2175
02:12:07.650 --> 02:12:11.390
you know you're,
you know,
you know things are about to get real good,
real good.

2176
02:12:11.391 --> 02:12:14.960
Either one of them.
Can you vanilla and next time we're working vanilla.

2177
02:12:15.360 --> 02:12:20.160
I have some vanilla.
You like vanilla for real.
No kidding.
Yeah,

2178
02:12:20.161 --> 02:12:22.670
I made the vanilla and give him to my son.
He's too,
by the way.

2179
02:12:23.180 --> 02:12:26.330
I think he thought it was like a for real milk,
like a dessert.
And he was like,

2180
02:12:26.360 --> 02:12:29.270
oh,
he's all like crying for it.
Have a video.
I sent it to Pete for real.

2181
02:12:29.271 --> 02:12:31.100
It's funny by the way.
And that was vanilla.

2182
02:12:31.580 --> 02:12:33.050
It's not just going to be vanilla though.

2183
02:12:34.380 --> 02:12:36.800
Gotta be vanilla something vanilla gorilla

2184
02:12:38.680 --> 02:12:43.070
is for real.
He was like,
are you serious?
And I was like,
yeah,

2185
02:12:43.430 --> 02:12:46.730
I mean,
of course.
And he goes,
he goes,
what do you mean?
I said,

2186
02:12:46.731 --> 02:12:51.090
put a white gorilla on there.
The Vanilla Gorilla is combat.

2187
02:12:51.770 --> 02:12:54.530
I would expect so much from John.
Makes Sense.
Yeah.

2188
02:12:54.531 --> 02:12:57.320
So we took a picture of you dean inputs,
but you on here,

2189
02:12:59.580 --> 02:13:04.490
boom.
Make sense?
Uh,
immersion camp by the way,
that Dean will be at,

2190
02:13:05.000 --> 02:13:08.690
and I would say come,
but if you didn't already sign up,

2191
02:13:08.870 --> 02:13:12.530
you're not going to be there because a,
it's sold out.
No kidding.
Official,

2192
02:13:12.950 --> 02:13:16.010
official sold out.
We'll be doing it next year.
We'll try and get,
you know,

2193
02:13:16.190 --> 02:13:19.730
come next year.
We'll try and expand it a little bit,
but it's sold out.
Sorry,

2194
02:13:19.990 --> 02:13:21.700
next time.
But those are fun.

2195
02:13:22.580 --> 02:13:26.960
I talk a little about that with people very often because they want to go

2196
02:13:27.650 --> 02:13:28.430
anyway.
Was good.

2197
02:13:28.430 --> 02:13:32.790
Also good way to support and support yourself and represent boom,
three things.

2198
02:13:32.970 --> 02:13:36.120
Boom,
boom,
boom.
Jock was a store called Jocko store.

2199
02:13:36.690 --> 02:13:40.050
You go to the Jocko store.com right,
makes sense.
Anyway,

2200
02:13:40.140 --> 02:13:44.490
this is where you can get the shirts.
The hoodies is more rash guards,

2201
02:13:44.491 --> 02:13:46.410
more Jocko representative.
You know,

2202
02:13:46.590 --> 02:13:50.070
kind of a little bit more direct message on that one,
but some good stuff.

2203
02:13:50.250 --> 02:13:54.750
If you want to represent a,
yeah,
go there.
Jocko.
store.com hats.
Yeah,
that's good.

2204
02:13:55.380 --> 02:14:00.210
Whatever.
Flex fit hats.
Flex fit the Nouveau snapback chic.

2205
02:14:00.630 --> 02:14:02.550
That's what flex flex fit our new Gucci

2206
02:14:06.390 --> 02:14:10.620
hoodies.
Legit hoodies and lightweight hoodies.
Yeah,
the lightweight hoodies.

2207
02:14:10.621 --> 02:14:14.050
Here's the thing,
right?
You made me like stutter step on the lightweight hoodies,

2208
02:14:14.051 --> 02:14:18.310
so like I have them in,
but they're not like in the pipe yet,
but we're good.

2209
02:14:18.600 --> 02:14:19.433
Keep them out of the pipe.

2210
02:14:20.040 --> 02:14:23.370
Now they're going in the pipe or there's people that there's,
there is people,

2211
02:14:23.580 --> 02:14:27.750
there are people,
a lot of support for the lightweight.
Everyone in Hawaii,

2212
02:14:28.930 --> 02:14:32.970
sir,
a bunch of people in Florida.
Sure.

2213
02:14:34.260 --> 02:14:37.830
Texas sometimes too.
But yeah,
that's a good way to support and represent.

2214
02:14:37.831 --> 02:14:38.220
Like I said,

2215
02:14:38.220 --> 02:14:42.900
[inaudible] dot com also good way to support is to subscribe to the podcast if

2216
02:14:42.901 --> 02:14:46.860
you haven't already.
Seems obvious.
I know,
but on iTunes and Stitcher,

2217
02:14:46.900 --> 02:14:47.910
drill obvious in school,

2218
02:14:47.911 --> 02:14:52.590
go play this for 137 episodes and I think I even say it seems obvious.

2219
02:14:52.591 --> 02:14:54.590
Every single diaries I have you say it seems obvious,

2220
02:14:54.591 --> 02:14:57.970
which kind of in Moraga which makes,
yeah,
exactly right.
But my point even more,

2221
02:14:57.971 --> 02:15:01.350
it seems obvious because I say it all the time and that's just kinda how with

2222
02:15:01.351 --> 02:15:03.030
podcasts you subscribed to the podcast,

2223
02:15:03.031 --> 02:15:06.060
that's how everyone knows that when you say things a certain way and then,

2224
02:15:06.100 --> 02:15:08.610
then you just think that's the best way to say it and you're just going to keep

2225
02:15:08.611 --> 02:15:10.890
saying yes,
it ain't broke,
don't fix it kind of thing.

2226
02:15:11.250 --> 02:15:13.530
Even though it kind of is broke because you look at me like his broke every

2227
02:15:13.531 --> 02:15:16.410
single time.
Either way.
When you're signing up for podcasts,

2228
02:15:16.470 --> 02:15:17.830
don't forget that there's also the war,

2229
02:15:17.831 --> 02:15:22.320
your kid podcast and you can subscribe to that one too.

2230
02:15:22.321 --> 02:15:24.810
You can play it for kids.
There's some stories on there.

2231
02:15:24.870 --> 02:15:28.920
There's some Q and a for uncle Jake,
which you know it's good.
Yeah,

2232
02:15:28.950 --> 02:15:33.480
I liked the story.
So k those stories I have to,
should I shorten it sometimes,

2233
02:15:33.540 --> 02:15:37.110
but all those stories I tell my daughter before bedtime stories.

2234
02:15:37.590 --> 02:15:42.350
Now you have a story now you know how like do you make yourself the first person

2235
02:15:42.351 --> 02:15:44.850
or character or do you save this aunt and Uncle Jake?

2236
02:15:45.600 --> 02:15:49.320
I actually don't even say uncle Jake.
So how do you make us different names?

2237
02:15:49.950 --> 02:15:52.920
Different names.
She thinks she's buying that.
Yes.
She's like,

2238
02:15:53.160 --> 02:15:57.920
you ripped this off from Jacqueline.
She's like,
Dad,
come on.
Where are you at?
No,

2239
02:15:58.010 --> 02:16:02.520
no,
no,
no.
She knows and he was think they're interesting.
We're running a race.

2240
02:16:02.580 --> 02:16:05.970
Okay.
No,
I don't say me.
No,
I don't see me.
I say,
look,

2241
02:16:06.030 --> 02:16:08.780
there was this girl who owe me money.
Yeah,
kinds of fun.

2242
02:16:08.790 --> 02:16:13.710
Like a royalties like scenario.
But you say someone else was running the race.

2243
02:16:13.740 --> 02:16:17.820
You say a story about some buddy and he was the important thing and hasn't she

2244
02:16:17.821 --> 02:16:20.780
heard the warrior kid podcast?
No.
Oh,
you know,

2245
02:16:20.810 --> 02:16:24.840
you've evil no holding out on her and you're taking my stories and now you're

2246
02:16:24.841 --> 02:16:25.770
making it your own.

2247
02:16:26.400 --> 02:16:29.950
And one day she's going to listen to me like she stole this story from daddy was

2248
02:16:29.951 --> 02:16:32.710
bad is I didn't realize those doing that.
But technically that is what happened.

2249
02:16:33.220 --> 02:16:35.950
What happened,
what happened?
It's cold blooded.
But either way,

2250
02:16:36.250 --> 02:16:40.820
if they don't hear those stories on the podcast for whatever reason or whatever

2251
02:16:41.710 --> 02:16:42.580
or what have you,

2252
02:16:43.630 --> 02:16:46.990
you have stories to tell and you know they're going to come with that lesson.

2253
02:16:47.050 --> 02:16:50.950
That's what I think is yet another element of value.
Immense value.

2254
02:16:51.500 --> 02:16:56.320
Keep podcasts through some of those stories on the,
uh,
on the youtube channel.

2255
02:16:56.440 --> 02:16:58.060
Yes.
The JOCKO podcast,
youtube channel,

2256
02:16:58.090 --> 02:17:01.690
and there's a warrior king podcast or a youtube channel.

2257
02:17:02.110 --> 02:17:06.160
So go to youtube,
subscribe to that if you want to see echoes,

2258
02:17:06.250 --> 02:17:07.150
legit videos,

2259
02:17:07.151 --> 02:17:11.440
which apparently he has some in the hopper and he's going to be releasing.

2260
02:17:11.740 --> 02:17:14.920
So we're looking forward to that as well,
which shouldn't be good.

2261
02:17:15.310 --> 02:17:18.470
Get them out there.
I think so.
Also on it.
Okay.

2262
02:17:18.550 --> 02:17:22.840
On att.com/jocko this is where you can get your kettle bells.

2263
02:17:23.200 --> 02:17:26.770
I got some heat for calling them artistic Kettlebell.
Actually,

2264
02:17:26.771 --> 02:17:29.980
it wasn't called them that for seven years.
It wasn't here.

2265
02:17:30.010 --> 02:17:34.150
It was like an intro oriented.
What's an artist like?

2266
02:17:34.300 --> 02:17:35.021
Primal bells.

2267
02:17:35.021 --> 02:17:40.021
The ones that look like faces on them on they're the gorilla.

2268
02:17:40.870 --> 02:17:44.830
He was where they were for,
but don't even think brother the best

2269
02:17:46.480 --> 02:17:51.250
you do kill us.
I used to.
Yeah,

2270
02:17:51.430 --> 02:17:56.050
so you get the werewolf warm is way better anyway.
Even looks better anyway.

2271
02:17:56.110 --> 02:17:59.230
They're cool and,
and you get it from on it.
So there's that.

2272
02:17:59.260 --> 02:18:02.660
I got rings and there's a bunch of other work.
Cool workup.

2273
02:18:02.661 --> 02:18:05.520
Sticking with couples are awesome.
Yeah,
but if they look awesome,

2274
02:18:05.530 --> 02:18:08.260
that's even more awesome when you saw the regular ones too,
by the way.

2275
02:18:08.261 --> 02:18:12.240
But that's what a lot of information to ama website,
psychological war.

2276
02:18:12.310 --> 02:18:16.630
It was psychological warfare and we're working on the second album,

2277
02:18:16.660 --> 02:18:19.510
but that's on iTunes.
If you want to hear me talking about

2278
02:18:21.760 --> 02:18:26.760
when to get after it instead of being a little baby and succumbing to your own

2279
02:18:28.240 --> 02:18:29.290
pathetic,

2280
02:18:29.620 --> 02:18:34.400
horrible laziness and we thought was nice.

2281
02:18:34.430 --> 02:18:36.970
Yeah.
Cool.
Yeah,
there's that.

2282
02:18:37.090 --> 02:18:39.580
Yeah there's white tea yet.

2283
02:18:39.730 --> 02:18:43.480
Jocko white tea in cans too by the way if you like tea and a can or if you just

2284
02:18:43.481 --> 02:18:45.120
like the whole idea of holding a,

2285
02:18:45.380 --> 02:18:47.320
you know like can you do with the energy drinks or whatever.

2286
02:18:47.350 --> 02:18:49.510
Jp told me today he's at caught.

2287
02:18:49.511 --> 02:18:53.310
Can you just pay me and Jocko white tea cause you know reason to have salon

2288
02:18:53.320 --> 02:18:56.530
front and I'm like brother we can make it happen man.

2289
02:18:56.620 --> 02:18:59.020
It's ordering Jocko white tea which is awesome.
Like I said,

2290
02:18:59.021 --> 02:19:04.021
it's awesome because as I said last time AP he used to get on those energy

2291
02:19:04.061 --> 02:19:08.080
drinks,
make time for that.
Now he's just getting on a little Jocko white tea.

2292
02:19:08.410 --> 02:19:13.410
Dean's been hammering the Jocko white tea and you're also an energy drink guy.

2293
02:19:14.740 --> 02:19:17.860
Yeah those,
those were the days where it wasn't regulated,
you know.

2294
02:19:18.330 --> 02:19:22.390
Oh Yeah Phaedra tea drink.

2295
02:19:23.170 --> 02:19:27.770
Hey do you drink tea?
Like in normal,
like everyday life.
Are you a drinker?
Yeah.

2296
02:19:27.771 --> 02:19:28.910
That's weird.
Right.
Me Too.

2297
02:19:28.911 --> 02:19:32.600
But I piled niece upon these older houses so I stopped,

2298
02:19:32.601 --> 02:19:36.200
I stopped using like the red bull type stuff.
That's not really.
Yeah.

2299
02:19:36.240 --> 02:19:40.930
And when this is like a transition kind of thing.
Make sense?
You had uh,

2300
02:19:41.060 --> 02:19:46.060
an of like an energy type drink the other day and because I was driving and I

2301
02:19:46.071 --> 02:19:49.790
needed a little bit of energy and it was like one of those ones that had said,

2302
02:19:49.791 --> 02:19:53.570
you know,
like all the,
all the little buzz words on it,
healthy,
natural,
blah,
blah,

2303
02:19:53.571 --> 02:19:56.690
blah,
blah.
So I drink this thing and all of a sudden,

2304
02:19:57.560 --> 02:20:02.270
30 minutes later I feel like I'm going to start stabbing like the road with a

2305
02:20:02.271 --> 02:20:04.070
battleaxe and attacking people.

2306
02:20:04.610 --> 02:20:09.610
Like it had 200 milligrams of caffeine to 400 milligrams of caffeine.

2307
02:20:10.820 --> 02:20:15.380
Yeah.
That's going to get you,
what are you doing?
Give me all that.
Are you psycho?

2308
02:20:16.070 --> 02:20:18.350
You're right.
It's their fault.
No.
Yeah,
you're right.
You're right.

2309
02:20:18.530 --> 02:20:23.300
It's all their fault.
Not your fault.
Good.
How's this?
So my wife,

2310
02:20:23.301 --> 02:20:26.030
she knows she's on the path of my life,
big time actually now,

2311
02:20:26.031 --> 02:20:27.410
just like boom on the path.

2312
02:20:27.810 --> 02:20:32.270
So listen to that podcast that I looked at her phone and it has the podcast.
Oh,

2313
02:20:37.870 --> 02:20:42.680
it's not that she's just on her own.
And I'm like,
oh man.
So I'm like,

2314
02:20:42.681 --> 02:20:45.380
okay.
The other day,
okay,
this is just an,
this was me,

2315
02:20:45.381 --> 02:20:48.290
this maybe to start maybe three,
four weeks ago,
right in the game.

2316
02:20:48.291 --> 02:20:51.680
So the other day I hear,
I'm like in the site,
not in the next room,

2317
02:20:51.681 --> 02:20:55.680
but kind of like to the side.
I'm not in her visual like so her,
you know,

2318
02:20:55.760 --> 02:20:59.120
people don't,
I'm not saying my wife talks to herself,
I'm not saying that,

2319
02:20:59.121 --> 02:21:01.340
but you know,
you say something,
you say,
oops,
you made a mistake,

2320
02:21:01.341 --> 02:21:05.530
just got under your breath,
can stuff.
She's like,
no.
She goes,

2321
02:21:07.370 --> 02:21:11.120
she pops another one of these can't just like,
I love this stuff to herself,

2322
02:21:11.570 --> 02:21:14.990
not to me.
She was like on her own,
like popping them and yeah,
she's,
she,

2323
02:21:15.230 --> 02:21:18.890
she's founding this,
this stuff.
So it's interesting.
I asked.
Here's the thing,

2324
02:21:19.040 --> 02:21:23.000
she is kind of a tea drinker.
She likes like if you,
okay.

2325
02:21:23.001 --> 02:21:28.001
If it was a blind double blind test and you just,

2326
02:21:29.420 --> 02:21:33.500
you just came into a room and you'd never drank this before and you picked up a

2327
02:21:33.830 --> 02:21:36.050
cup,
somebody put it in your hand and put it in your mouth.

2328
02:21:36.200 --> 02:21:40.610
Would you say it was tea?
I would,
but I'm not like a,
hey,
that's,

2329
02:21:40.700 --> 02:21:43.190
that's tea.
You know,
I'm not a teaching or,
that's why I asked.

2330
02:21:43.230 --> 02:21:47.300
I was asking if you're a tea drinker because I know it tastes like tea if you

2331
02:21:47.301 --> 02:21:49.530
drink tea,
but if it was just,
if you would just like you in a,

2332
02:21:49.540 --> 02:21:52.400
in a store and grabbed a,
can you open,
you'd be like,
oh,
this is interesting.

2333
02:21:52.550 --> 02:21:56.750
You wouldn't maybe necessarily,
no,
it was tea maybe.
Yeah.

2334
02:21:56.751 --> 02:21:57.980
Well don't say that in England.

2335
02:21:59.850 --> 02:22:04.100
That's evil over there.
I think it's,
yeah.
Oh,
it's bad tank.
Okay,

2336
02:22:04.660 --> 02:22:05.570
well they just don't drink it.

2337
02:22:05.810 --> 02:22:10.190
They drink their tea warm or hot and with milk in it.
Do you put milk in that?

2338
02:22:10.310 --> 02:22:13.870
I know,
right?
It seems like like a psycho thing to do with this one.

2339
02:22:13.910 --> 02:22:15.710
Don't do that nonetheless.
Good.
Hey,

2340
02:22:15.711 --> 02:22:20.120
I got some books where the warrior kid books for your kid.

2341
02:22:21.680 --> 02:22:23.350
There's one of them.
It's called way of the warrior kid.

2342
02:22:23.360 --> 02:22:25.890
Then the second one in that series is Mark's mission.

2343
02:22:26.100 --> 02:22:27.870
<v 0>Got The discipline equals freedom field manual.</v>

2344
02:22:28.470 --> 02:22:30.090
If you need to know how to get after it,

2345
02:22:30.570 --> 02:22:33.720
that's where you find out how to get after it.
The audio version,
that book,

2346
02:22:33.721 --> 02:22:37.980
you get it on Itunes as an MP,
three or Amazon music or Google play or whatever.

2347
02:22:38.700 --> 02:22:39.960
Also got extreme ownership.

2348
02:22:42.300 --> 02:22:46.950
That's about combat leadership written by by me and my brother Leif Babin and on

2349
02:22:47.010 --> 02:22:52.010
September 25th the dichotomy of leadership comes out that iconomy of leadership.

2350
02:22:52.260 --> 02:22:53.880
It's a followup.
Leif and I wrote it.

2351
02:22:53.881 --> 02:22:58.881
Fall of two extreme ownership dives in and it gets granular on how to balance

2352
02:22:59.371 --> 02:23:04.371
the opposing forces of leadership so that you and your team can win dichotomy.

2353
02:23:06.190 --> 02:23:07.023
You liked the word

2354
02:23:08.570 --> 02:23:12.270
things all smiling and I was waiting for you to say it actually.
I said it once.

2355
02:23:12.271 --> 02:23:13.680
I only said it once.
This podcast,

2356
02:23:13.710 --> 02:23:18.710
which is weird because I should have said it a bunch because in Jujitsu you've

2357
02:23:19.111 --> 02:23:22.230
got to be aggressive,
but there's a dichotomy because you can't be do aggressive,

2358
02:23:23.040 --> 02:23:26.190
you've got to be offensive.
But at the same time,
you've got to also,

2359
02:23:26.220 --> 02:23:28.200
there's a dichotomy because you gotta be defensive,
right?

2360
02:23:28.670 --> 02:23:30.600
You've got to train with the Geeky.

2361
02:23:30.660 --> 02:23:34.650
But there's a dichotomy because you've also got a train without tags me and
yeah,

2362
02:23:34.770 --> 02:23:37.410
so there's a dichotomy there.
He ended Ogi both of important.

2363
02:23:38.040 --> 02:23:42.570
So you've got to do it.

California,
October 17th and 18th all the other ones have sold out.

2373
02:24:20.790 --> 02:24:24.900

Leadership Seminar,
two days of

2376
02:24:33.120 --> 02:24:37.200
granular practical leadership.
It's not,

2377
02:24:37.420 --> 02:24:41.340
it's not a motivation that they can get.
You can do this,

2378
02:24:41.370 --> 02:24:44.610
and I'm not saying you won't be motivated because I get motivated,
but what?

2379
02:24:44.630 --> 02:24:47.790
We're not there going like,
how can we motivate these people?
That's not even,

2380
02:24:48.720 --> 02:24:53.460
that word's not even said at any point at all.
Neither is you can do it.

2381
02:24:53.550 --> 02:24:56.640
Yeah.
Do you ever say that?
Never know,

2382
02:24:57.460 --> 02:25:02.440
but how the strength today,
he was a strong person.
You believe in yourself,

2383
02:25:02.460 --> 02:25:06.100
you are great.
For sure.
That does not what his ass,

2384
02:25:07.020 --> 02:25:07.980
that is not what is happening.

2385
02:25:08.060 --> 02:25:11.490
We talk about leadership and leadership is the most important thing on the

2386
02:25:11.491 --> 02:25:12.300
battlefield.

2387
02:25:12.300 --> 02:25:14.940
It's the most important thing in your business and it's the most important thing

2388
02:25:14.941 --> 02:25:15.870
in your life.

2389
02:25:16.170 --> 02:25:20.730
So if you want to come and learn some pragmatic leadership skills,

2390
02:25:21.060 --> 02:25:21.893
then come with the muster.

2391
02:25:23.410 --> 02:25:28.180
Also for current law enforcement,
military border patrol,

2392
02:25:28.181 --> 02:25:32.080
firefighters,
paramedics,
first responders,
all you out there in uniform,

2393
02:25:32.081 --> 02:25:35.770
we got roll call number zero zero one is our first roll call.

2394
02:25:35.771 --> 02:25:38.440
We're having roll call because the musters two days,

2395
02:25:38.650 --> 02:25:43.330
it's pricey and we wanted to offer something to military law enforcement to the

2396
02:25:43.331 --> 02:25:47.260
folks out there in uniform to come and get a condensed version focused on the

2397
02:25:47.261 --> 02:25:51.250
dynamic leadership situations that you all face.

2398
02:25:51.550 --> 02:25:54.100
That's September 21st in Dallas,
Texas.

2399
02:25:54.101 --> 02:25:59.101
You also register for that@extremeownership.com and also we now have f Overwatch

2400
02:26:02.291 --> 02:26:05.530
echelon front,
Overwatch,
overwatch.com okay,
so this is it.

2401
02:26:05.980 --> 02:26:08.200
We've been working with companies for all these years.

2402
02:26:09.490 --> 02:26:12.130
All these years we've been working with all these various different companies

2403
02:26:12.131 --> 02:26:16.030
and all these companies.
We work with them and help their leadership.
Well,

2404
02:26:16.031 --> 02:26:19.150
they want to hire leaders,
they want to bring leaders on board.

2405
02:26:20.890 --> 02:26:24.100
We were also in the military,
all of us additional on front were in the military.

2406
02:26:24.130 --> 02:26:28.090
And we have connections with a lot of people that were in the military that,

2407
02:26:29.050 --> 02:26:33.550
that want to go work at jobs with great companies.

2408
02:26:33.580 --> 02:26:37.390
So in order to connect those two groups,

2409
02:26:37.630 --> 02:26:42.630
people that want jobs and people that need leaders in their business go to

2410
02:26:44.670 --> 02:26:48.160
[inaudible] dot com to get in the game.

2411
02:26:48.550 --> 02:26:53.550
And you can either register as someone that's looking for a job to focused on

2412
02:26:54.880 --> 02:26:58.480
special ops folks and combat aviation,

2413
02:26:59.110 --> 02:27:02.080
those types of what we're looking at right now,

2414
02:27:02.560 --> 02:27:06.790
we're going to broaden that out and put together another company in the very

2415
02:27:06.791 --> 02:27:10.000
near for another arm of this company.
And,

2416
02:27:10.810 --> 02:27:13.630
but that's where we're starting because that's basically the reason we're

2417
02:27:13.631 --> 02:27:16.660
starting.
There's cause that's the element that we have connections with.

2418
02:27:16.960 --> 02:27:18.520
And so as we expand,

2419
02:27:18.550 --> 02:27:23.080
and we're working this right now to get the lines of communication open in the

2420
02:27:23.110 --> 02:27:27.130
other branches of the military so that we can bring on board,
you know,
uh,

2421
02:27:27.190 --> 02:27:30.310
other folks.
But again,
this is,
we started with the groups that we know.

2422
02:27:30.550 --> 02:27:35.350
So if you're in those groups,
go register.
If you're getting ready to retire,

2423
02:27:35.500 --> 02:27:39.010
if you're looking at getting out and you don't know what you're going to do
next.

2424
02:27:39.070 --> 02:27:42.010
We need leaders,
America needs leaders.

2425
02:27:42.520 --> 02:27:46.840
These businesses need experienced leaders that understand the principles.

2426
02:27:46.841 --> 02:27:50.830
We talk about the principles that are in extreme ownership of the things that

2427
02:27:50.831 --> 02:27:55.570
you learned in combat.
The things you learned leading troops on the battlefield.

2428
02:27:57.070 --> 02:27:58.960

02:28:23.260 --> 02:28:28.260
<v 4>til we're rolling up a monster or Brolin in Texas or rolling it at the immersion</v>

2435
02:28:28.791 --> 02:28:32.180
camp.
Until then,
we're all up on the interwebs.
Dean,

2436
02:28:33.170 --> 02:28:36.710
Dean lister,
Dean is at on Instagram,

2437
02:28:36.850 --> 02:28:39.260
Dina's at Dean Lister Bjj.

2438
02:28:39.800 --> 02:28:42.440
That's right on Twitter.

2439
02:28:42.530 --> 02:28:47.270
You might not even remember this on Twitter.
Your Dean underscore lister.

2440
02:28:47.510 --> 02:28:51.380
I looked up to see if you had Twitter,

2441
02:28:51.770 --> 02:28:53.040
you had a post,
your,

2442
02:28:53.200 --> 02:28:58.200
your last post was in 2010 did Twitter exist in 2010 I'm not even kidding.

2443
02:29:00.130 --> 02:29:03.980
I thought Twitter was like three years old.
No.
Has it been around that long?

2444
02:29:03.981 --> 02:29:08.420
When was it invented?
Easily before 2010 it makes sense.

2445
02:29:09.260 --> 02:29:13.820
I knew that well cause he just kind of said he did.
Amen.
All good.

2446
02:29:14.150 --> 02:29:19.060
Yeah.
When three years ago factually,
uh,

2447
02:29:19.310 --> 02:29:23.810
and uh,
Facebook,
you do you do Facebook?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Instagram.

2448
02:29:24.850 --> 02:29:28.100
Yeah,
it's again more now.
Basically there's one,
it's like a fan,
you know,

2449
02:29:28.101 --> 02:29:31.380
they make the audit generate one for you.
If you find you go see you or whatever,

2450
02:29:32.210 --> 02:29:35.870
if you have a certain amount of friends.
I personal one it's me and my mom,

2451
02:29:35.871 --> 02:29:40.820
my sister in the cage.
And then there was another one.
I don't know.
What is mean.

2452
02:29:41.330 --> 02:29:43.460
Remember you made,
no,
you didn't make me,

2453
02:29:43.461 --> 02:29:46.220
but you asked me to set you up one like eat 10 years ago.
Yeah.

2454
02:29:46.221 --> 02:29:48.620
But there's another one.
Oh,
another one on top of that.

2455
02:29:49.400 --> 02:29:53.290
It's actually post things about me.
But what's the real one?
It's uh,

2456
02:29:53.360 --> 02:29:58.130
just dean lister.
Yeah.
It's just,
that's me in a cage with my,
my mom,
my sister.

2457
02:29:58.240 --> 02:30:02.150
Yeah.
Right on.
Uh,
and that's where you can find a snow.
Of course.

2458
02:30:02.160 --> 02:30:06.620
Echo is at echocharles in all mediums.
Yes,
I am at Jocko Willink.

2459
02:30:07.100 --> 02:30:10.790
Echo.
You got anything else?
Nope.
Pretty cool to hang with dean in this capacity.

2460
02:30:10.830 --> 02:30:12.310
You know,
like I see every,

2461
02:30:12.320 --> 02:30:16.500
literally every time I come here pretty much literally pretty much.
I see.

2462
02:30:16.530 --> 02:30:18.830
You know,
whatever,
by the way,

2463
02:30:19.130 --> 02:30:24.130
you're my first actually your class,

2464
02:30:24.230 --> 02:30:29.030
it was my third.
She did some class really old to live with that in that half

2465
02:30:31.220 --> 02:30:33.080
a strong back then too.
If you ever heard him tell that.

2466
02:30:33.081 --> 02:30:35.580
So like he thought he could take you kinda.
Yeah.
Yeah.

2467
02:30:35.640 --> 02:30:39.530
I told him a couple of days.
Okay.

2468
02:30:39.770 --> 02:30:43.160
So the mean cake not story is different.
So it was like when I,

2469
02:30:43.161 --> 02:30:45.240
for the first time I ever rolled with you,
you were like,
Hey,

2470
02:30:45.241 --> 02:30:48.860
I've come roll like you.
Yeah.
And I was like,
how,
how,

2471
02:30:48.920 --> 02:30:50.240
this is literally what I thought.

2472
02:30:50.480 --> 02:30:54.320
How embarrassing is it going to be and how awkward is it going to be if like I

2473
02:30:54.321 --> 02:30:55.580
get dean today?

2474
02:30:55.800 --> 02:30:59.280
Like that's how what I was thinking that I was literally not to sit and he

2475
02:30:59.281 --> 02:31:02.540
wasn't like this fantasy.
It was literally worried about the awkwardness.

2476
02:31:02.570 --> 02:31:04.550
So that's how really it was to me.
I didn't,

2477
02:31:04.640 --> 02:31:07.130
I'm not saying I was going to get you,
but to me there was a chance,

2478
02:31:07.730 --> 02:31:10.700
but I was like,
yeah,
it's okay.
You know,
he'll,
he'll respect that.
If that happens.

2479
02:31:10.701 --> 02:31:13.880
I'm not saying it,
we'll put it in my kind of thing.
Right.
When you,

2480
02:31:13.900 --> 02:31:16.700
you know how you were saying right when you locked up,
and this is uh,
yeah,

2481
02:31:16.800 --> 02:31:20.400
this was maybe like a week or yeah.
Oh five.
Yeah.

2482
02:31:20.670 --> 02:31:25.650
So this may be like a week or two into Jujitsu.
Right.
Even then,

2483
02:31:25.651 --> 02:31:26.520
right when we locked up,

2484
02:31:26.521 --> 02:31:30.410
I knew that there is zero chance of me beating Dean right now.

2485
02:31:30.790 --> 02:31:35.020
Maybe Dave Burke came on and we were talking about top gun and how like he,

2486
02:31:35.021 --> 02:31:36.860
he set it up really nicely and he's like,
oh,
he,

2487
02:31:36.861 --> 02:31:40.000
if he had a guy that was really good about when this whole thing,
he's like,

2488
02:31:40.080 --> 02:31:44.610
then his chance of beating a,
you know,
me as a top gun instructor would be zero,

2489
02:31:45.360 --> 02:31:49.470
0%.
There's no,
and that's kind of the situation.
Yes.
There's literally,

2490
02:31:49.830 --> 02:31:52.860
I'm saying there's actually no possible way,

2491
02:31:53.790 --> 02:31:56.790
no possible way that you could have submitted dean lister,
no possible way.

2492
02:31:56.791 --> 02:31:59.910
And I knew that like literally right when we locked up and I was like,
okay.

2493
02:32:00.030 --> 02:32:02.850
And it was,
um,
uh,
and even at that point,

2494
02:32:02.880 --> 02:32:05.280
even before this was like when you were in pride,

2495
02:32:05.281 --> 02:32:08.700
this was like right after you won or maybe right before.
No,
no,

2496
02:32:08.740 --> 02:32:13.130
it was right before you one.
ADCC oh man.

2497
02:32:13.590 --> 02:32:15.030
Or right after,
I don't know.

2498
02:32:15.031 --> 02:32:17.800
I remember one day you came in and everyone cheered for you cause it's the first

2499
02:32:19.180 --> 02:32:21.650
fish.
She started my shadow on the super fight.
Maybe.
Yes,

2500
02:32:21.960 --> 02:32:23.360
that's what it was actually.
Yep.
Know,

2501
02:32:24.390 --> 02:32:27.000
Jacques Machado and the super fights that we had come Prieto who's an awesome

2502
02:32:27.001 --> 02:32:29.100
guy,
came up to help train you.

2503
02:32:29.700 --> 02:32:32.850
And so we were all training you and we were all training with you and,

2504
02:32:33.600 --> 02:32:37.300
and uh,
when we got to the fight,
this is the,

2505
02:32:37.301 --> 02:32:41.130
this is the difference in attitudes,
right?
So he got to the match,

2506
02:32:41.190 --> 02:32:43.140
I won't call it a fight because it's not a fight,
it's a match.

2507
02:32:43.500 --> 02:32:47.250
And you are going against John Jacques Machado who is a legendary,

2508
02:32:47.280 --> 02:32:48.780
legendary Jujitsu player.

2509
02:32:49.440 --> 02:32:54.440
And when you got to like a dominant position and you were up by life,

2510
02:32:54.720 --> 02:32:57.820
hold on.
Hey,
you're up by like three or four points.
Like go for the

2511
02:33:00.640 --> 02:33:03.870
hold right there.
Hold,
you got this,
you know,
like that type of thing.

2512
02:33:03.871 --> 02:33:07.340
Strategical and Brazilians stick by there and on the goal.
And

2513
02:33:12.060 --> 02:33:15.490
it was funny right before the match coach trained for like three weeks,
you know,

2514
02:33:15.780 --> 02:33:18.390
and a over right before now she goes,
Hey,
do you didn't want to talk to you?

2515
02:33:18.680 --> 02:33:21.210
He said in English actually,
he went,
just so you know,

2516
02:33:21.300 --> 02:33:24.990
I came down here to help you and if you don't win today,

2517
02:33:25.500 --> 02:33:30.090
I have let you down.
And I feel like I'm a,
I'm a like whatever.
I was like,

2518
02:33:30.600 --> 02:33:34.430
he's like,
so if you lose,
I lose her also.
And you know,
I really hope you win.

2519
02:33:34.630 --> 02:33:38.590
And I'm like damn to the oppression,
you know,
cause that ownership,

2520
02:33:39.740 --> 02:33:43.810
I don't want to let you down if I'm not,
I don't want to,

2521
02:33:43.811 --> 02:33:48.750
you don't let some cy ops on.
You're pretty cool.
And it worked.
But yeah,

2522
02:33:48.751 --> 02:33:51.520
that was uh,
yeah,
that was it.
Those good.
It's good.

2523
02:33:51.530 --> 02:33:55.110
Well it's cause my point is cool to hang with you in this capacity,
you know,

2524
02:33:55.350 --> 02:33:59.310
slightly different,
but it's more simple than nonetheless.
Dean,

2525
02:33:59.311 --> 02:34:02.730
any closing thoughts?
I'll just,
uh,
you mentioned the first responders.

2526
02:34:02.790 --> 02:34:06.180
I think for them.
Most importantly,
get on the mat.

2527
02:34:06.900 --> 02:34:10.590
If you any kind of forced smarter and you deal with erratic people,

2528
02:34:10.591 --> 02:34:13.440
I think it's really good.
Uh,
it does take some,

2529
02:34:14.370 --> 02:34:18.010
some measure to put yourself in the situation where are,
you will be

2530
02:34:18.010 --> 02:34:21.010
<v 0>weaker than people to get stronger.
But I think it's very important.</v>

2531
02:34:21.011 --> 02:34:24.430
I think that's,
I see more seals than I'm at that I do cops.

2532
02:34:24.580 --> 02:34:28.030
I think cops need more and then a seal.
I know.

2533
02:34:28.031 --> 02:34:31.480
So I hope to see more of this from first responders on the mat learning this

2534
02:34:31.481 --> 02:34:34.510
kind of stuff.
It's just really valuable.
Definitely.

2535
02:34:34.640 --> 02:34:38.610
I look forward to the immersion camp at the Ford.

2536
02:34:39.100 --> 02:34:40.480
Awesome man.
Well,
uh,

2537
02:34:41.560 --> 02:34:44.470
obviously thanks for coming on Dean [inaudible] or we've been putting this off

2538
02:34:44.471 --> 02:34:47.800
for a while and I'm sure he'll be back on again and we'll talk more.

2539
02:34:47.860 --> 02:34:50.030
Jewishy it's stories.

2540
02:34:51.390 --> 02:34:56.350
Got a cow and thanks to everyone else out there for listening and,

2541
02:34:56.470 --> 02:35:01.390
and especially those of you that wear the uniform.
So,
yeah.
You know,

2542
02:35:01.510 --> 02:35:05.830
military police,
firefighters,
border patrol,
paramedics,

2543
02:35:05.831 --> 02:35:07.120
all their first responders.

2544
02:35:08.050 --> 02:35:13.050
We know that all of you make sacrifices every day to protect us and we

2545
02:35:15.070 --> 02:35:18.070
absolutely thank you for that.
And like Dean,

2546
02:35:18.250 --> 02:35:20.980
I also hope that all you and all those jobs,

2547
02:35:21.730 --> 02:35:26.730
find some time to train some Jujitsu because it'll make you better at your job.

2548
02:35:26.731 --> 02:35:29.440
It will make you better at life.
And if you can't find Jujitsu,

2549
02:35:29.800 --> 02:35:34.750
go find some boxing or some judo or some wrestling or some Moy Tai or some way

2550
02:35:34.751 --> 02:35:38.800
to train so that you can fight when the time comes.

2551
02:35:39.620 --> 02:35:39.890
<v 1>Okay.</v>

2552
02:35:39.890 --> 02:35:43.430
<v 0>And,
and really that goes to everyone that is listening to this.</v>

2553
02:35:44.270 --> 02:35:48.640
If you can get out there and fight
you out there,
fight,
fight,

2554
02:35:48.700 --> 02:35:49.533

<v 1>Okay.</v>

2556
02:35:50.970 --> 02:35:55.350
<v 0>And fight metaphorically in your everyday life.</v>

2557

Fight against the enemy.
Fight against the criminals.

2558
02:35:58.440 --> 02:36:03.000
Fight Against Fire and catastrophe.
Fight against your training partners.

2559
02:36:03.150 --> 02:36:06.360
Fight against your weakness.
Fight against slaw off,

2560
02:36:06.480 --> 02:36:11.480
fight against laziness and stagnation and fight to stay on the path and live in

2561
02:36:12.811 --> 02:36:14.880
accordance with the way.

2562
02:36:16.310 --> 02:36:16.920
<v 1>Yeah.</v>
