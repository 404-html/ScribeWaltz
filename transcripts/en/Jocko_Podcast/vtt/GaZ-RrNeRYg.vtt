00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:05.630
This is Jocko podcast number 40 with Echo Charles and me,

2
00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:10.560
Jocko Willink.
Good Evening Echo,
good evening.

3
00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.290
And the last podcast that we did,

4
00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:20.400
I went a little long with the book.

5
00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.250
The book was brave men

6
00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.710
by a guy named Ernie Pyle and there was just some incredible writing in there

7
00:00:31.561 --> 00:00:34.950
that I just went deep with.
I read it all

8
00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.140
and so we had to postpone the Q and a so that's okay.

9
00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:51.000
Gave us some time here to gives us some time here to go a little deep on some Q

10
00:00:51.001 --> 00:00:53.430
and.
A.
This is podcast number 40 by the way,

11
00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.850
40 weeks straight who wants some 40 weeks straight is where we're at.

12
00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.630
And that's apparently that's the battle rhythm here.

13
00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:09.080
We put out podcasts and we do it weekly and we've been doing it for 40 straight

14
00:01:09.991 --> 00:01:12.030
weeks and I did that.

15
00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:19.170
And it's not always easy,
you know,

16
00:01:19.171 --> 00:01:21.240
cause if you think about the times,

17
00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:23.550
think about the times when you're not doing anything

18
00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:28.680
well when you're not doing anything or when I would normally not be doing

19
00:01:28.681 --> 00:01:32.460
anything for 40 weeks I've been doing something,
I've been reading,

20
00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.360
I've been prepping,
I've been researching.
So 40 weeks is legit and I'm,

21
00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.290
I'm stoked that we're at number 40.
Me Too.

22
00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:46.490
And now we get to talk about some questions from the interwebs.

23
00:01:46.741 --> 00:01:50.610
So thanks to everybody for giving us the,
uh,
awesome questions through Twitter,

24
00:01:50.611 --> 00:01:55.050
through Facebook.
It's pretty much where they come from.
Twitter and Facebook,

25
00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:59.640
I guess.
I get a couple emails.
I get texts too from like some of my,

26
00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:01.200
some of my buddies in the seal teams,

27
00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:02.880
they'll hit me up with a question here and there.

28
00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.920
A lot of times I just respond to them,
keep it real.
Um,
sometimes I

29
00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:13.080
use them.
Sure.
But anyways,
yeah,
let's get to it.

30
00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.090
Let's do it.
Okay.

31
00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:21.000
[inaudible] first question from the vault.
From the vault.

32
00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:25.620
I've got a lot of questions.
I've got a big vote.
Got a big vote.

33
00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:29.280
And so I was just trying to go through and make sure there wasn't any questions

34
00:02:29.281 --> 00:02:32.340
or just reviewing questions that might be good that I missed the first time

35
00:02:32.341 --> 00:02:32.671
around.

36
00:02:32.671 --> 00:02:37.030
So this one right here is from the volts from the old school to all Western one

37
00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:41.760
that you always intended to maybe revisit.
Yes.
We go revisiting it.
Yes.

38
00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:46.610
Let the revisit begin
started Jujitsu,

39
00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:51.330
thanks to you.
Any tips for complimentary exercises,

40
00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:56.220
especially for nonathletic civilian?
What's the hardest stage of your end?

41
00:02:56.221 --> 00:02:59.320
What's the hardest stage of your Jujitsu journey?
Yeah,
and that's actually,

42
00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:02.860
that's actually,
it was two questions combined them into one cause they're,

43
00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:07.990
they're kind of a similar and,
okay.

44
00:03:07.991 --> 00:03:11.530
So do you just do one thing that's cool.
Bunch of Jujitsu is it's a,

45
00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:17.090
it's a very well rounded physical activity,
right?

46
00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:19.660
You've got to have flexibility,
you've got to have strength,

47
00:03:19.661 --> 00:03:22.780
you've got to have endurance.
You got to be able to recover quickly.

48
00:03:22.781 --> 00:03:27.250
Went from fatigue.
Yes.
You got to have some agility.
Speed,

49
00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:30.760
balance,
coordination.

50
00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:32.440
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

51
00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:36.790
<v 0>Proprioception.
Do you know what proprioception is?
[inaudible] it's,</v>

52
00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:41.860
it's knowing where your body is in space.
Sure.
It's,

53
00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:46.760
it's a talent that gymnast have very well.
Yes,
yes.

54
00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:49.910
Um,
maybe a dancer has rule,

55
00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:52.590
they know where their body is in space.
Yeah.

56
00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:57.340
And Jujitsu demands that you know where your body is at all times.

57
00:03:57.341 --> 00:04:00.850
So that's the stuff that you need to work on.
All this,
all those things.

58
00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:03.910
Cause Jujitsu is a unique test of all those things.

59
00:04:03.911 --> 00:04:06.370
It's a test of your strike that's a test of your flexibility to test of your

60
00:04:06.371 --> 00:04:09.400
endurance.
It's a test of your ability to recover.

61
00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:11.680
It's a test of your agility.

62
00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:15.070
It's a test of your speed of your coordination is a test of all those things.

63
00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:19.270
And so that makes it,
that makes it,
um,

64
00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:21.560
<v 1>yeah,</v>

65
00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:25.520
<v 0>a really good sport to practice in my opinion.
So,</v>

66
00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:30.980
uh,
what do you need to do?
What you need to do,
um,
to,

67
00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:34.520
to train them and you need to trade all those things.
You know?

68
00:04:34.521 --> 00:04:38.030
So for flexibility,
I like,

69
00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:42.260
I personally like to MobilityWOD I think that's excellent.
You know,

70
00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:46.320
but you don't get some kind of stretching protocol,
uh,

71
00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:50.990
gymnastics type smooth movements.
There's gymnastic bodies,

72
00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:53.720
which is a ridiculous Lee good

73
00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:59.210
protocol.
You can go on.
It's an internet thing.
Gymnastics,

74
00:04:59.211 --> 00:05:03.890
[inaudible] dot com and what is that like a workout?
Yeah,
it's a flexibility.

75
00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:08.690
Yeah,
it's,
it's,
it's hardcore.
It's hardcore.

76
00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:11.870
Um,
but that's really good.
Or you know,
you'll get your flexible,

77
00:05:11.871 --> 00:05:16.310
you get all kinds of stuff from that.
But so you gotta be flexible.

78
00:05:16.311 --> 00:05:18.680
You've got to work on your flexibility.
So what are you gonna do?
Like I said,

79
00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:21.980
you're going to do mobility,
water,
some kind of stretching protocol.

80
00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:25.400
So you get limber,
you've got to work on your strengths are,
what do you do?

81
00:05:25.401 --> 00:05:30.160
Work on strength,
Olympic lifting,
what does that clean and jerk snatches,
uh,

82
00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:35.420
that brings in things like cleans by themselves,
you know,

83
00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:39.890
uh,
presses and hang queens and all that.
And then on top of that for strength,

84
00:05:39.891 --> 00:05:44.810
you also have the simple movements,
the dead lift,
the squat,

85
00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:48.680
the front squat,
the overhead squat,
and also first strength.

86
00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:53.900
You can go back to gymnastics again,
go back to those gymnastics movements.

87
00:05:53.901 --> 00:05:58.610
And basic calisthenics,
pullups pushups,

88
00:05:58.611 --> 00:06:02.600
dips,
squats,
flutter,
kicks,
that whole nine yards.

89
00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:07.310
Now you got to have endurance,
right?
So what do you do for endurance?

90
00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:12.050
You could see where this is heading for endurance,
what he gotta do,
run,
swim,

91
00:06:12.051 --> 00:06:16.850
bike,
some kind of metcon.
I liked the metcon personally for my,

92
00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:21.410
for my cardiovascular endurance and recovery and whatnot,

93
00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:24.620
you know,
so yes,
you can,

94
00:06:24.621 --> 00:06:29.510
you can add running and sprinting into those.
You can sprint swimming,

95
00:06:29.511 --> 00:06:31.130
you can sprint on a bike,

96
00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:36.110
you can use kettle bells to work your met come scenario.

97
00:06:36.111 --> 00:06:40.400
You can actually use barbells to do metcons,
you know,

98
00:06:40.401 --> 00:06:45.280
do a bunch of cleans and you will get tired.
And uh,

99
00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:46.970
and then with that,
when you work on your insurance,

100
00:06:46.971 --> 00:06:49.070
that thereby improves your recovery.

101
00:06:50.450 --> 00:06:53.420
And so that's,
that's going to help you there.

102
00:06:54.410 --> 00:06:58.520
Then you have agility and for agility.
What do you do to some sports?
Some,

103
00:06:58.610 --> 00:07:00.620
some cross training of sports.

104
00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:05.270
I personally like to surf.
Um,
but you know,

105
00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:10.670
it's not just that it's basketball,
it's go play soccer,
go Haka,

106
00:07:10.671 --> 00:07:14.420
baseball,
whatever set you work on your agility.
Then you get your speed.

107
00:07:14.421 --> 00:07:15.890
And I already talked about this.
You got you're running,

108
00:07:15.891 --> 00:07:18.260
you're sprinting and the air bike or whatever

109
00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:24.200
the appropriate reception,
the the gymnastics,

110
00:07:24.201 --> 00:07:28.010
the movement type things,
or you're holding your body in space.

111
00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:33.470
So that's a lot of stuff.
That's a lot of stuff.

112
00:07:34.190 --> 00:07:39.190
And you pile all that together and you got a lot of varied,

113
00:07:40.730 --> 00:07:42.110
varied activity.

114
00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:45.290
And what's nice about that is when people talk about getting burnt out,
I'm like,

115
00:07:45.291 --> 00:07:47.150
well I never get burnt out on working out.

116
00:07:47.780 --> 00:07:51.410
I got 97 different bass exercises that I can use.

117
00:07:51.411 --> 00:07:54.350
I'm not going to get burned out.
So,

118
00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:57.480
and what's fun is you jump into these challenges like or,

119
00:07:57.481 --> 00:08:00.560
or you find something that's challenging that you can't do and you go,
okay,

120
00:08:00.561 --> 00:08:01.490
well I'm going to try and do that.

121
00:08:01.550 --> 00:08:03.620
I'm going to see what I can get my weight up to on this.

122
00:08:03.621 --> 00:08:07.100
I'm going to see if I can do this movement in gymnastics.

123
00:08:07.101 --> 00:08:09.680
I'm going to see if I can do this many pull ups or whatever.

124
00:08:09.681 --> 00:08:13.790
You do keep continually varying and heading in a different direction.

125
00:08:13.850 --> 00:08:14.683
And I think,

126
00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:18.350
I think when you combine all those things together and you become a well rounded

127
00:08:18.351 --> 00:08:21.940
athlete,
that is what will help you the most with the Jujitsu well,

128
00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:25.550
but I don't think there's one exercise like hey this will help you in Jujitsu.

129
00:08:26.510 --> 00:08:28.830
Although the clean and jerk is pretty good.
Yeah.

130
00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:32.870
Anything with like your body weight.

131
00:08:33.210 --> 00:08:37.370
So cause like in Judith that when you're doing Jujitsu that's mainly what it is.

132
00:08:37.371 --> 00:08:38.750
Sure.
There are elements where you're,

133
00:08:38.751 --> 00:08:41.880
you're trying to control someone else's body with,

134
00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:45.400
but it's mainly what you're doing with your body.
So like when you do,
you know,

135
00:08:45.450 --> 00:08:49.570
you know like
when you climb up oh the pegboard yes.
Yeah.

136
00:08:49.610 --> 00:08:54.210
Like that kind of stuff.
Bars,
all the gymnastic stuff.
Um,

137
00:08:54.530 --> 00:08:56.040
and then as far as

138
00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:59.400
<v 2>like being strong in these weird ways cause that's essentially what you're going</v>

139
00:08:59.401 --> 00:09:01.950
to be doing.
And you do too,
you know,
there is,
there is though,

140
00:09:02.070 --> 00:09:06.660
there is in Jujitsu you're oftentimes you're moving someone else's way too.

141
00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:09.900
Yeah.
In,
in guys that are super explosive.

142
00:09:10.510 --> 00:09:13.170
Oh that's a different thing to deal with.
And it's,

143
00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:17.730
it's a good trait to have to be super explosive.
Yes,
for sure.

144
00:09:17.731 --> 00:09:21.820
So the,
so you combine that with what I like when you shrimp out the summit,

145
00:09:21.940 --> 00:09:24.570
right?
Yup,
sure.
Something's gonna be trying to holding you,
but when you shrimp,

146
00:09:24.571 --> 00:09:27.720
you're pushing your own body weight,
that's your own body weight of sure.

147
00:09:27.721 --> 00:09:30.810
You add his own,
that's you're with a guy that's just kind of part of the game.

148
00:09:30.811 --> 00:09:35.670
But if you can control your own body in these stronger ways,

149
00:09:35.730 --> 00:09:38.610
that's going to give like such a big benefit.
So,

150
00:09:38.611 --> 00:09:42.690
and then to your Olympic lifting.
To me that's,
in my opinion,
that's

151
00:09:44.220 --> 00:09:45.830
probably one of the best ones.
Olympic.

152
00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:50.610
And this is why not only do you get that little little explosion,
uh,

153
00:09:50.611 --> 00:09:54.360
explosive movements in there,
but when you,
uh,

154
00:09:54.361 --> 00:09:57.900
when you put Olympic lifting,
lifting to make up your metcon,

155
00:09:59.580 --> 00:10:02.970
when you do like a clean,
like a clean and press right,
you,

156
00:10:03.330 --> 00:10:05.940
your muscle work is just for a second.

157
00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:10.050
And then for a second it's almost kind of relaxed and then pull them again and

158
00:10:10.051 --> 00:10:14.330
then it's kind of relaxed and then you hold and boom and it's just repetitive to

159
00:10:14.350 --> 00:10:19.240
you.
That's kind of what you did.
So it can be depending on your game.
Yeah.
Yeah.

160
00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:20.060
So,

161
00:10:20.060 --> 00:10:24.810
and if you're in shape in that way where you can go hard rest for just a little

162
00:10:24.811 --> 00:10:27.930
bit and then go hard again,
if that's kind of,
if you can do that,

163
00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:31.590
if you're in that kind of shape,
that's going to help.
So when you do,

164
00:10:31.620 --> 00:10:33.360
when you do a met Connor circuit training,

165
00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:38.260
something like that where if you can do the exercise dynamic risks,

166
00:10:38.261 --> 00:10:42.330
like active rest,
you know where you were,
you're walking or even jogging kind of.

167
00:10:42.450 --> 00:10:44.430
That's what you do too,
is it's like work and you're,

168
00:10:44.460 --> 00:10:46.360
cause you're never really just laying there,
you know,

169
00:10:47.220 --> 00:10:49.580
do that kind of thing and do it in like rounds.
If,

170
00:10:49.581 --> 00:10:52.290
if you're into like a 10 minute round and you did too and that's really your

171
00:10:52.291 --> 00:10:55.680
thing,
then do your circuit train 10 minute rounds,
you know,
it'll like,

172
00:10:55.681 --> 00:10:59.320
it'll help,
it'll get you kind of aware of like,
okay,
I'm this tired,

173
00:10:59.321 --> 00:11:02.610
they're going to manage,
you know,
all this stuff.
Um,
but yeah,
I agree.

174
00:11:02.670 --> 00:11:04.860
I think metcon,
swimming,
Ooh,
swimming.

175
00:11:05.310 --> 00:11:09.030
Well if you do swimming sprints cause it's like your whole body,
you know,

176
00:11:09.330 --> 00:11:12.510
as you see,
the less the least,
the less comfortable you are in the water,

177
00:11:12.630 --> 00:11:17.490
the more those swimming things are going to be challenging for you.

178
00:11:17.900 --> 00:11:21.460
But Hey,
speaking of Olympic lift,
you know,
do you know mo Mo Wall?
Yeah.

179
00:11:22.170 --> 00:11:23.350
Have you returned with them?
No.

180
00:11:23.820 --> 00:11:26.970
So Molo off if for those of you listening that don't know who moe is,

181
00:11:26.971 --> 00:11:31.640
he's a really incredibly good wrestler.
He wrestled in college and,

182
00:11:31.641 --> 00:11:36.630
and he is a,
he didn't,

183
00:11:36.660 --> 00:11:39.240
he didn't make the Olympic teams but he was like in second,

184
00:11:39.270 --> 00:11:43.180
he almost made the Olympic team but he's a big guy so he's,
you know,

185
00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:48.000
like 205 pounds.
And,
uh,
he is,

186
00:11:48.210 --> 00:11:48.511
he,

187
00:11:48.511 --> 00:11:53.511
I think he is the most explosive person I've ever

188
00:11:54.250 --> 00:11:57.490
<v 0>trained with when I've trained with some unbelievably,</v>

189
00:11:58.390 --> 00:11:59.920
incredibly explosive people.

190
00:12:00.730 --> 00:12:05.050
And you'll find that if anybody wrestled on a high,

191
00:12:05.051 --> 00:12:09.310
high level,
like if they were,
if they were a high level college wrestler,

192
00:12:09.430 --> 00:12:12.760
well there's a likely chance that they're very explosive.
But yeah,

193
00:12:13.060 --> 00:12:18.060
they're very expressive and mo is explosive to a crazy level.

194
00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:23.830
But the reason that I thought of it when you said Olympic lifts is one time he

195
00:12:23.831 --> 00:12:27.280
was just trying to help you with some take downs and he was the way he was

196
00:12:27.281 --> 00:12:30.910
exploding into him and he was all fired up.
He's like,
you know,

197
00:12:30.911 --> 00:12:33.320
it's like when you do a clean and jerk,
he goes,
this right here is,

198
00:12:33.330 --> 00:12:34.810
is it the beginning of it?
And he's,

199
00:12:34.840 --> 00:12:38.020
you could see that he's developing so much explosiveness.

200
00:12:38.140 --> 00:12:42.910
The first time I ever trained with him,
uh,
Dean Dean,
the,

201
00:12:42.911 --> 00:12:47.200
I can never read dean with,
with,
when he sets me to train with somebody,

202
00:12:48.370 --> 00:12:50.170
he doesn't give me a heads up.
Like if I were going to tell you,

203
00:12:50.171 --> 00:12:50.710
if there was like,

204
00:12:50.710 --> 00:12:54.970
let's say there was a guy that was a really good wrestler and I go,
I go,
hey,

205
00:12:54.971 --> 00:12:57.760
echo train with this guy over,
hey,
he's a really good wrestler.

206
00:12:58.470 --> 00:13:01.240
And I might even say how many and say,
hey man,

207
00:13:01.241 --> 00:13:03.370
he's a really good wrestler and he's got a sick guillotine.

208
00:13:03.460 --> 00:13:07.180
So you're like thinking about it,
right?
I'll give you a little heads up,
dean,

209
00:13:07.181 --> 00:13:11.140
just discos.
Hey,
you should train with him.
Right.
That's what Dean does.

210
00:13:12.310 --> 00:13:15.760
And so anyways,
he did tell me on this occasion he goes,

211
00:13:15.761 --> 00:13:19.840
hey mose coming down.
You got to train with him.
He's a really sick wrestler.

212
00:13:20.140 --> 00:13:24.460
And I go,
awesome.
I think to myself,
oh cool.
You know,
I've,

213
00:13:24.520 --> 00:13:28.300
I actually,
for a guy that didn't wrestle in,
in high school,

214
00:13:29.050 --> 00:13:32.830
I have decent takedown defense because I've been defending,

215
00:13:32.831 --> 00:13:36.370
take Dallas for a long time.
He and I utilize Jujitsu,
did if I might take down.

216
00:13:36.371 --> 00:13:40.210
So I'm sprawling and guillotine and going,
going for communalism,
doing active,

217
00:13:40.211 --> 00:13:43.540
aggressive Jujitsu moves to people when they're trying to take me down.
So I'm,

218
00:13:43.610 --> 00:13:47.080
no,
I'm not trying to say I have any major skills there,

219
00:13:47.081 --> 00:13:51.460
but I'm not a slouch to take down.
So I figured,
Hey,

220
00:13:51.461 --> 00:13:54.530
I got a good wrestler.
Cool.
And He,
and he wasn't that experience in Jujitsu,

221
00:13:54.550 --> 00:13:57.070
which tells you,
okay,
cool,
cold,
you know,
you're going to get to in this guy,

222
00:13:57.071 --> 00:14:01.540
this isn't,
you know,
or at least have a good chance,
whatever.
Yeah.

223
00:14:01.630 --> 00:14:06.520
I'm thinking that.
So I meet Mo and a good dude,
you know,
or,

224
00:14:06.521 --> 00:14:09.790
or going over some moves and then it's like time to train and dean's like,
okay,

225
00:14:09.791 --> 00:14:13.120
yeah,
you,
you train with them,
Jocko.
And I go,
okay,
cool.
So you know,

226
00:14:13.121 --> 00:14:16.300
we slap hands and we're doing the,
and Mo was getting ready for a fight,

227
00:14:16.301 --> 00:14:18.040
but we weren't fighting at all.
We were just,

228
00:14:18.150 --> 00:14:20.290
and it just the kind of put in context of them and you say,

229
00:14:20.291 --> 00:14:23.410
Moe's look good wrestler Mo also happens to be

230
00:14:24.970 --> 00:14:29.260
the Bella tour to five or it wasn't even a champ.
He wasn't that this time.

231
00:14:29.261 --> 00:14:33.070
This was before.
This was like as he was getting into MMA.
Oh,
okay.
Yeah.

232
00:14:33.220 --> 00:14:36.880
So he was really actually probably sharper wrestling at this time cause he was

233
00:14:36.881 --> 00:14:38.050
coming out of,
you know,

234
00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:43.030
trying to be on the Olympics and yeah,
he wrestled,

235
00:14:43.180 --> 00:14:46.150
I want to say he wrestled at Oklahoma but anyways,

236
00:14:46.840 --> 00:14:49.470
King Mo is what he's known is king.

237
00:14:50.350 --> 00:14:54.500
And so anyway,
so we slap hands were getting ready,
you know,
we,

238
00:14:54.501 --> 00:14:59.330
we kind of square off and I'm,
I'm,
you know,
okay,
do my thing.
Boom.

239
00:14:59.360 --> 00:15:03.380
He,
he does this take down to me,
his,

240
00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:04.760
his face,

241
00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:09.710
his face hits me in the chest and this is in the less than the blink of an eye

242
00:15:10.010 --> 00:15:14.120
is face hits me in the chest and his hands,
they don't even grab my legs.

243
00:15:14.180 --> 00:15:18.710
They just tap my legs like a double leg and it's a blast double.

244
00:15:18.740 --> 00:15:23.540
And I'm in the air.
I mean,
I mean he's,
he knocked me into the air with his face.

245
00:15:23.710 --> 00:15:26.820
Let's say it a lot,
cause you're huge.
He knocked me into the air with,

246
00:15:26.900 --> 00:15:30.770
with his face.
I,
I fall down to the ground.

247
00:15:31.280 --> 00:15:36.230
And the funny thing was it was,
I got back up immediately.
Like,
he didn't even,

248
00:15:36.890 --> 00:15:37.970
he took me down so fast,

249
00:15:37.971 --> 00:15:40.130
he couldn't even chase me to the ground because I was already,

250
00:15:40.220 --> 00:15:41.540
I was back up really quickly,

251
00:15:41.900 --> 00:15:46.390
but that was the fastest take down that you know,

252
00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:49.970
that I'd felt that is probably the fastest takedown.
Now we have one more guy.

253
00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.550
There's a guy coming up right now at the gym,

254
00:15:52.730 --> 00:15:55.940
a nother sick wrestler.

255
00:15:57.200 --> 00:15:59.960
But you know,
he wrestled,
he's a really good wrestler,

256
00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:05.090
a sick rest or collegiate wrestler and all that.
Um,
Taylor,
Taylor Johnson.

257
00:16:05.510 --> 00:16:10.130
So Taylor is another guy who has mutant strength.

258
00:16:10.190 --> 00:16:10.610
He's,

259
00:16:10.610 --> 00:16:15.610
he has mutant strength on normal is not normal.

260
00:16:17.090 --> 00:16:22.090
I was on Taylor and I was going for like a guillotine or I think I was actually

261
00:16:23.751 --> 00:16:24.920
going for a crucifix though.
I was.

262
00:16:25.040 --> 00:16:27.230
So for those of you that don't know what this is,

263
00:16:27.830 --> 00:16:32.640
Taylor picture take picture of guy on all fours on the ground and someone else

264
00:16:32.641 --> 00:16:34.880
is trying to rip their head off.
Okay.
So that's Taylor.

265
00:16:34.881 --> 00:16:39.340
He's on all fours on the ground and I'm trying to guillotine him,

266
00:16:39.350 --> 00:16:44.210
rip his head off with one hand.
He,
he,

267
00:16:44.390 --> 00:16:48.950
he goes up to his knees and lifts me into the air and shop,

268
00:16:48.951 --> 00:16:53.951
puts me through the air onto the ground and is and then gets across side and I

269
00:16:57.861 --> 00:17:01.250
started laughing.
I'm like,
Bro,
you just shot,
put me.

270
00:17:01.400 --> 00:17:03.290
And he didn't even do it from his,
from his hips.

271
00:17:03.290 --> 00:17:05.420
Like he didn't get the strength from his hips.

272
00:17:05.480 --> 00:17:08.950
He got it from his upper torso.

273
00:17:09.530 --> 00:17:12.590
He didn't use his legs at all,
has no legs cause he was on his knees.

274
00:17:13.970 --> 00:17:17.330
And so he just has this massive explosiveness.

275
00:17:17.780 --> 00:17:22.780
But then in the thing that's really scary about Taylor is that he's adapting.

276
00:17:23.240 --> 00:17:26.630
He cause it because just because you're a good wrestler doesn't mean you

277
00:17:26.631 --> 00:17:28.250
automatically adapt well to Jujitsu.

278
00:17:28.310 --> 00:17:33.080
Some people never adapt really well to Jujitsu.
And you can see,

279
00:17:33.081 --> 00:17:35.360
I mean in MMA,
in the UFC,

280
00:17:35.361 --> 00:17:37.850
there's plenty of wrestlers that you look at and you go,
yeah,

281
00:17:37.851 --> 00:17:42.290
that guy never really transitioned into become a comprehensive ground fighter

282
00:17:42.410 --> 00:17:46.580
that was as comfortable on his back as he is all these cross side as he is going

283
00:17:46.581 --> 00:17:47.414
for submissions.

284
00:17:47.570 --> 00:17:50.070
There's some guys that would have been extremely successful but never made

285
00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:54.330
<v 3>that transition.
But they stay on top ground impound.
Taylor,</v>

286
00:17:54.390 --> 00:17:56.010
if you watch him role you,

287
00:17:56.011 --> 00:17:59.340
you might not even know he was a wrestler until you roll with them and then

288
00:17:59.341 --> 00:18:02.010
you're going to feel that you can't move them.
But if you just watch him rolling,

289
00:18:02.011 --> 00:18:04.710
you'll be like,
oh wow,
he's going for,
you know,
advanced.

290
00:18:04.711 --> 00:18:08.520
You did some moves might away been training for less than a year.

291
00:18:09.930 --> 00:18:14.490
Very surprising with him in regards to that.
Like he look at them,

292
00:18:14.820 --> 00:18:17.160
if you look at him,
you buddy,
okay,
I'm about to roll with this guy.

293
00:18:17.161 --> 00:18:18.480
And then you roll with him,
you're going to be like,
okay,

294
00:18:18.481 --> 00:18:22.550
I'm not surprised at this guys.
Like this guy is strong,
is balanced,
is just like,

295
00:18:23.550 --> 00:18:28.200
like magical balance kind of thing.
Um,
so when you look at,
I mean on the,
on the,

296
00:18:28.290 --> 00:18:31.710
on the surface,
but if you know that he's such an accomplished wrestler,

297
00:18:31.820 --> 00:18:35.490
you would think given his experience you'd think,
okay,
his,

298
00:18:35.491 --> 00:18:40.200
his Jujitsu or even his,
like when he's training his Jujitsu,
you know,

299
00:18:40.201 --> 00:18:43.260
you wouldn't expect it to be that fluid.
Like when I rolled with him I was like,

300
00:18:43.770 --> 00:18:46.830
I thought when you were like,
yeah,
Taylor's,
he's kind of this new guy,
you know,

301
00:18:46.831 --> 00:18:48.380
you,
you,
you haven't rolled with him,
what are,

302
00:18:48.381 --> 00:18:50.460
you should roll with him because you know,
he,

303
00:18:50.520 --> 00:18:54.660
he gives good training is really good.
So what I'm thinking is good,

304
00:18:54.661 --> 00:18:59.040
but I'm thinking this is going to be real wrestling intensive training scenario.

305
00:19:00.280 --> 00:19:04.990
No,
he didn't pull guard but his whole thing.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

306
00:19:05.370 --> 00:19:08.790
He was like,
I'm here to train Amir to,
you know,
get good or whatever,
man.

307
00:19:08.791 --> 00:19:12.950
And he's,
and that kind of attitude.
It gets you so good.
And he's hamming.

308
00:19:13.050 --> 00:19:17.040
It wasn't,
he wasn't trying to like,
okay,
another big guy,
let me wrestle this guy.

309
00:19:17.041 --> 00:19:21.240
He was,
we were doing straight up Jujitsu and,
and he's,
he was,
it was clean,

310
00:19:21.270 --> 00:19:23.070
it was good.
But anyways,

311
00:19:23.071 --> 00:19:27.780
he's got that super explosiveness to that's that's mutant level and also his

312
00:19:27.781 --> 00:19:31.280
striking.
Yeah.
That's ridiculous.
And he hasn't been known ab,

313
00:19:31.290 --> 00:19:34.490
he's just a natural athlete cause he'd been just anyways,
so that's,

314
00:19:34.500 --> 00:19:36.210
I mean we've got a bunch of other pipe fitters to,
I mean,

315
00:19:36.211 --> 00:19:40.060
you got big Andy who's awesome.
Justin,

316
00:19:40.460 --> 00:19:42.900
he's good about Justin Jordan just showed up.
So we've got some,

317
00:19:43.740 --> 00:19:48.390
got some good training.
Yeah.
But back to this deal.

318
00:19:48.450 --> 00:19:53.040
So I was talking to Taylor about,
I go,
bro,

319
00:19:53.041 --> 00:19:56.400
did you ever like Olympic lift?
And he goes,
yeah,
yeah.

320
00:19:56.401 --> 00:20:00.510
I got into crossfit for like a month
and uh,

321
00:20:00.600 --> 00:20:03.420
and that was right before I got into MMA and I was doing pretty good.

322
00:20:03.480 --> 00:20:05.310
And I was like,
oh,
what does that mean?
He's like,
oh,
always.

323
00:20:05.700 --> 00:20:09.740
I could snatch the snatching like 300 e.
I was like,
whoa.

324
00:20:09.780 --> 00:20:11.250
And then invited me to the crossfit games.

325
00:20:11.270 --> 00:20:15.150
He did crossfit for a month and never snatch before and all of a sudden he's

326
00:20:15.151 --> 00:20:19.800
snatching almost 300 pounds.
That's,
that's insane.
Yeah.
So,

327
00:20:20.250 --> 00:20:20.940
but that,

328
00:20:20.940 --> 00:20:24.780
and that's what it feels like when you roll with somebody that has that kind of

329
00:20:24.781 --> 00:20:29.520
explosive strength.
It's a very,
very,
it's,
it's a very good tool to have.

330
00:20:29.720 --> 00:20:33.200
Now there's other,
we could go through the entire list of body types,

331
00:20:33.210 --> 00:20:35.610
strengths and weaknesses because you know,
you get,

332
00:20:36.120 --> 00:20:39.360
you get the lanky people that are strong and why relate to Higgs,

333
00:20:39.361 --> 00:20:43.050
you rolled with heads before,
right?
Nah,
he exists.
Lanky,

334
00:20:43.051 --> 00:20:46.080
wirey skinny.
When he puts a triangle on you,

335
00:20:46.081 --> 00:20:50.330
it starts to cut your body cause he's all,
you know,
uh,

336
00:20:50.410 --> 00:20:53.070
come pre dose like that.
Capri owes us again blank.

337
00:20:53.080 --> 00:20:55.300
Like how can you sweep him when his arm is,

338
00:20:55.380 --> 00:20:59.410
is basing like for like eight feet over there is where he's basing,

339
00:20:59.560 --> 00:21:03.650
so you get that kind of body,
then you get the real small,
like a stocky,
uh,

340
00:21:04.420 --> 00:21:09.370
people with no limbs sticking out.
Right?
Yeah.
You can't,
it's hard to choke him.

341
00:21:09.790 --> 00:21:13.540
So anyways,
we could go through everybody's style,
but in each one of them has an,

342
00:21:13.570 --> 00:21:14.620
has an advantage.

343
00:21:15.100 --> 00:21:18.520
But the thing that's cool about explosiveness is something you can somewhat

344
00:21:18.521 --> 00:21:20.920
trained,
right?
You can somewhat trained now you can't,

345
00:21:20.950 --> 00:21:25.570
you're not going to be able to naturally get as explosive as Mola wall or as

346
00:21:25.571 --> 00:21:29.620
Taylor Johnson,
but you can get stronger,

347
00:21:30.350 --> 00:21:33.100
right?
You can get strong or so,
but,

348
00:21:33.130 --> 00:21:37.570
but the other thing is where can you defeat them?

349
00:21:37.571 --> 00:21:39.310
Where can you,
where can you be better than them?

350
00:21:39.400 --> 00:21:42.730
Maybe you can be more flexible than that.
Maybe you can be faster on a scramble.

351
00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:45.850
Maybe you can be heavier and tighter.

352
00:21:45.851 --> 00:21:48.700
So there's some athletic things that you could try and do,

353
00:21:48.701 --> 00:21:53.320
try and improve to overcome and negate some of their advantages.
Hard to do.

354
00:21:53.350 --> 00:21:58.060
You get some people that are mutants.
Dean's big and flexible,

355
00:21:58.090 --> 00:22:01.180
right?
Dean as being strong.
It's a shockingly flexible.

356
00:22:01.390 --> 00:22:05.800
Glover is so flexible that you know,

357
00:22:05.801 --> 00:22:08.080
you have to negate that in Glover,
you know,

358
00:22:08.081 --> 00:22:11.110
he loves training with big muscle bound guys.
That's his,

359
00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:14.210
that's like an easy day for him.
That's what he likes to,
you know?
That's what,

360
00:22:14.240 --> 00:22:17.520
that's the,
that's the,
that's the,
the easiest matchup.

361
00:22:17.530 --> 00:22:21.850
Body style for him is someone that's just super,
super strong and muscle bound.

362
00:22:21.970 --> 00:22:25.480
Yeah.
And that you get,
it's like,
and I'd say that's kind of,

363
00:22:25.570 --> 00:22:27.440
that's kind of a good way of putting it mute.

364
00:22:27.441 --> 00:22:31.870
And like Taylor where he has a wrestling background so he's no stranger to like

365
00:22:32.020 --> 00:22:35.710
functioning while he's tired,
you know?
So I would say if you're big,

366
00:22:36.280 --> 00:22:38.590
explosive,
strong or whatever,

367
00:22:38.800 --> 00:22:42.220
typically your endurance is not that good typically.

368
00:22:42.490 --> 00:22:46.240
So if you get all those factors and they're flexible and stuff and they have

369
00:22:46.241 --> 00:22:50.920
endurance,
there's your bad day right there.
If this guy has that.
Other than that,

370
00:22:51.070 --> 00:22:54.520
if you take one or two different attributes,
you can always find,
it's like rock,

371
00:22:54.521 --> 00:22:56.830
paper,
scissors.
You can always find one that can,

372
00:22:57.010 --> 00:23:00.520
if you just employ this strategy,
it'll give you more of an advantage.
And,

373
00:23:00.521 --> 00:23:03.280
and cause I always like to tie this together to leadership.

374
00:23:03.630 --> 00:23:06.800
So it's the same thing with leadership and what,

375
00:23:06.801 --> 00:23:09.610
because people will ask me all the time or are leaders born or made or you know,

376
00:23:09.611 --> 00:23:11.290
can you,
can you develop a leader?

377
00:23:11.830 --> 00:23:15.700
Everybody is born with certain leadership characteristics.

378
00:23:15.760 --> 00:23:19.240
It's just like a video game where they rank your strength and your intelligence

379
00:23:19.241 --> 00:23:21.310
and your agility and all this stuff that we just talked about.

380
00:23:21.910 --> 00:23:24.580
People have that further leadership capability as well,
right?

381
00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:27.700
Are they articulate?
You know,

382
00:23:27.701 --> 00:23:30.970
because that's some people articulate and that as a good advantage to have.

383
00:23:31.360 --> 00:23:32.830
Can you read people well?

384
00:23:32.860 --> 00:23:35.650
Well that's another thing that some people are naturally good at.

385
00:23:36.340 --> 00:23:41.290
Can you simplify things?
That's a talent that some people have.

386
00:23:41.291 --> 00:23:45.130
Now you could go on this list,
but what you find is that people,
some

387
00:23:45.990 --> 00:23:50.990
<v 0>are are gifted and they have really strong leadership characteristics,</v>

388
00:23:52.431 --> 00:23:54.350
leadership traits.
And that's great.

389
00:23:55.760 --> 00:23:58.520
And then you get some people that don't have those.

390
00:23:58.550 --> 00:24:02.440
And so what are you gonna do to the same thing that I have to do in my Jujitsu

391
00:24:02.450 --> 00:24:05.510
game?
How do you develop those things?
How do you become more articulate?

392
00:24:05.511 --> 00:24:06.980
How do you simplify things?

393
00:24:06.981 --> 00:24:11.540
How do you recognize that you are a person that makes things more complex?

394
00:24:11.541 --> 00:24:15.050
And how do you focus on making things simplified?

395
00:24:15.230 --> 00:24:17.810
So you just go right down the list.
So yes,

396
00:24:17.811 --> 00:24:20.360
you can be born with some natural leadership characteristics,

397
00:24:20.361 --> 00:24:24.400
but if you're not born with them,
how do you develop them?
It's,

398
00:24:24.700 --> 00:24:28.100
it's usually these things aren't that hard to develop either.
You know?

399
00:24:28.850 --> 00:24:33.230
So when you have weaknesses,
identify them.

400
00:24:33.260 --> 00:24:38.260
Be Humble enough to identify them and then see how you can improve upon them.

401
00:24:38.690 --> 00:24:43.690
And although they may never become your staple of your game,

402
00:24:45.260 --> 00:24:47.570
either as a leader or a Jujitsu player or anything else,

403
00:24:47.840 --> 00:24:51.410
they can become that you,
it's not something you have to protect.

404
00:24:51.530 --> 00:24:54.350
It's not something you have to worry about.
Yeah.
Yeah.

405
00:24:54.351 --> 00:24:58.130
You can kind of function in those little regards.
Now you can become functional.

406
00:24:58.970 --> 00:25:03.620
And for instance,
if you're not the most articulate person,

407
00:25:03.621 --> 00:25:07.280
well number one,
you can,
you can study,

408
00:25:07.340 --> 00:25:11.390
you can listen to people speak,
you can record yourself speaking,

409
00:25:11.391 --> 00:25:14.750
you can video yourself so you can practice and become more and more articulate.

410
00:25:14.751 --> 00:25:16.970
And you can,
that means,
oh,
guess what?
I'm not very techie though.

411
00:25:16.971 --> 00:25:19.760
So guess what I'm gonna do.
I'm going to plan more.
Before I go and brief people,

412
00:25:20.390 --> 00:25:22.160
I'm going to go through exactly what I'm gonna say.

413
00:25:22.161 --> 00:25:25.400
I might even rehearse it two times.
Then I'm going to sound articulate.

414
00:25:25.400 --> 00:25:28.460
So you're going to make up for those those problems and that's all you have to

415
00:25:28.461 --> 00:25:29.840
do is figure out how you can,

416
00:25:30.380 --> 00:25:34.760
how you can make up or how you can get rid of or how you can mitigate some of

417
00:25:34.761 --> 00:25:35.930
those weaknesses that you have.

418
00:25:35.931 --> 00:25:38.960
The other thing you could do is you surround yourself with somebody that's super

419
00:25:38.961 --> 00:25:41.540
articulate.
Echo,
you're more [inaudible] than me.
Cool.

420
00:25:41.541 --> 00:25:44.150
I want you to put out the word of the troops.
Boom,
done.

421
00:25:44.570 --> 00:25:46.610
Even though I might be in charge,
I'll say,
all right,
hey,

422
00:25:47.050 --> 00:25:49.710
echo is going to brief this operation over or echo is going to brief this

423
00:25:49.711 --> 00:25:52.370
strategy and then boom,
Mr articulate echo gets up there and does it.

424
00:25:53.810 --> 00:25:56.810
Maybe not the best example,
but that's what you do.

425
00:25:56.870 --> 00:25:59.540
That's how you want to that.
That's how you,

426
00:25:59.600 --> 00:26:03.200
you fill in the holes in your leadership game and the,

427
00:26:04.160 --> 00:26:04.880
by the way,

428
00:26:04.880 --> 00:26:08.750
you'll never have the ability to do that if you're not humble enough to admit

429
00:26:08.900 --> 00:26:12.950
where you have weaknesses and that they're there.
Yeah,
totally true.

430
00:26:13.110 --> 00:26:16.580
And I know you,
you back to the GT three real quick,

431
00:26:16.640 --> 00:26:19.940
I know you were saying all these things kind of with it,

432
00:26:20.300 --> 00:26:24.710
given that really the main thing to train is how much,
you know Jujitsu.

433
00:26:24.740 --> 00:26:27.770
That's really kind of the main,
that is the main thing.
Yeah,
the number one thing.

434
00:26:27.771 --> 00:26:31.790
So that's all it's like I said a given cause the question instrumental stuff for

435
00:26:31.791 --> 00:26:33.890
sure.
So yeah,

436
00:26:33.891 --> 00:26:37.280
so let's say these all these little comparisons like you know the,
the,

437
00:26:37.610 --> 00:26:41.840
to me aside from knowing Jujitsu,
that's the main strength or whatever.

438
00:26:41.870 --> 00:26:44.220
If everyone's even to me the taller

439
00:26:44.220 --> 00:26:48.690
<v 3>guy has the advantage that to me that's the most effective advantage that I've</v>

440
00:26:48.691 --> 00:26:50.930
seen.
It's interesting that you think that,
yeah,

441
00:26:51.030 --> 00:26:55.440
I don't think I necessarily agree with you.
What a very tall,

442
00:26:56.310 --> 00:27:01.310
very lanky guy will have is a body type that w that you come across the least.

443
00:27:03.570 --> 00:27:07.380
So since you are coming across this body type the least to get the less time you

444
00:27:07.381 --> 00:27:08.930
have the least train against it.

445
00:27:09.300 --> 00:27:11.280
And since you have less training yet so you don't have to react to it.

446
00:27:11.370 --> 00:27:12.450
And by the way,

447
00:27:12.810 --> 00:27:17.810
they constantly work on their strange body style because you are correct in the

448
00:27:19.321 --> 00:27:24.150
fact that the lanky body style
is,

449
00:27:24.210 --> 00:27:28.470
is gives you more moves,

450
00:27:28.500 --> 00:27:33.290
more unique moves than any other body style.
So there's unique mood,

451
00:27:33.300 --> 00:27:34.050
there's more,

452
00:27:34.050 --> 00:27:39.050
more unique moves that only are utilized or can be utilized by a tall,

453
00:27:39.631 --> 00:27:42.420
lanky person.
Then there are then any other body style.

454
00:27:42.930 --> 00:27:47.760
And also you can pretty,
I mean I'm not saying he's seven feet tall,

455
00:27:47.761 --> 00:27:52.710
I'm saying
up to,
yeah,
like six one doesn't do it to me.

456
00:27:53.130 --> 00:27:56.140
Well six one can do it if the president's in beginning of it,

457
00:27:56.370 --> 00:28:01.370
but how like we have stilts appropriately named at the gym and he has,

458
00:28:02.221 --> 00:28:07.221
he's tall and my kid think he's six five but he has really developed the Lanky

459
00:28:07.531 --> 00:28:11.580
guy style that people aren't used to and it's a challenge for anybody.
Yeah.

460
00:28:11.581 --> 00:28:15.870
So still too a good example where in this case where he's little bit different

461
00:28:15.930 --> 00:28:20.280
because still to has the lengthy buddy style,
but he,
he went pretty,

462
00:28:20.281 --> 00:28:21.000
he goes,

463
00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:25.410
he's going pretty hard in that direction where he's missing moves that only he

464
00:28:25.411 --> 00:28:29.010
can be kind of thing.
So that's what,
that's exactly the point I'm making.
Right,

465
00:28:29.011 --> 00:28:33.280
right.
So my,
whereas most normal body styles,
everybody that's,
you know,

466
00:28:33.450 --> 00:28:36.540
five,
three,
two,
you know,

467
00:28:36.900 --> 00:28:41.580
six Oh they all have pretty much the same moves.
Right?
Yeah.

468
00:28:41.590 --> 00:28:44.700
So what I'm talking about,
I'm not talking about them,
I th I think there's that,

469
00:28:44.760 --> 00:28:47.460
but those are the kind of the outliers I think overall.

470
00:28:47.490 --> 00:28:49.490
I mean everyone plays their strengths in one form or another,

471
00:28:49.491 --> 00:28:51.690
but I'm saying just it all things being equal.

472
00:28:51.691 --> 00:28:55.680
So like let's say all three Gracie brothers,
Hodra,
Gracie,

473
00:28:55.681 --> 00:28:59.040
even these guys who were,
who were taught,
these are like six,
three,
six,
four,
six,

474
00:28:59.430 --> 00:29:02.790
five type guys.
We'll take Hodgett for example.

475
00:29:02.791 --> 00:29:07.680
He doesn't really do any kind of crazy.
I am tall,
so I'm,
I can only do this.
True.

476
00:29:07.681 --> 00:29:09.040
No,
he doesn't do that yet.
I was like,
you know,

477
00:29:09.780 --> 00:29:11.850
but his like just a mount for example,

478
00:29:12.030 --> 00:29:17.030
or his arm bar set up from the bottom or from the bottom stuff is just way

479
00:29:17.851 --> 00:29:21.690
harder to deal with because he developed such a good base on top of the fact

480
00:29:21.691 --> 00:29:25.770
that physically he's made for such a good base,
you know?
And he and,
okay.

481
00:29:25.771 --> 00:29:27.840
And here's the thing about tall guys in general,

482
00:29:27.870 --> 00:29:30.860
they're not limited to the moves they can do.
They can do more or less.
Yes.

483
00:29:30.900 --> 00:29:33.600
All of the move.
So like the guy who's five,
three,

484
00:29:33.601 --> 00:29:38.601
two 50 or we'll say five three to 20 and just say five,

485
00:29:39.091 --> 00:29:42.100
eight I'm sure.
Two two 30 whatever.
We'll just say that's

486
00:29:42.100 --> 00:29:46.870
<v 2>a stocky buff guy.
He's gonna have a hard time doing triangle on guys.</v>

487
00:29:46.900 --> 00:29:50.560
He's on size and his weight division.
He probably the chancellor him.
Yeah.

488
00:29:50.650 --> 00:29:55.420
That's a triangle.
The mark of the game move.
Yes.
You can't do it.
Yeah.

489
00:29:55.421 --> 00:29:58.510
Tall guys don't have that problem.
They can do all the moves,
they can do chokes,

490
00:29:58.530 --> 00:30:01.750
armbars,
whatever.
And he was pretty easy,
you know.
So like I said,

491
00:30:01.751 --> 00:30:06.280
that's why I think and of course the,
the flexible tall,

492
00:30:06.281 --> 00:30:09.430
lanky guys,
they do have that.
But I think we all do,

493
00:30:09.730 --> 00:30:14.710
I think have like our body style,
give us special moves only we can do.

494
00:30:14.950 --> 00:30:17.500
Even if you're shorting stocks,
the list of moves,

495
00:30:17.530 --> 00:30:22.260
the list of special moves that I can do with my body style is like too.

496
00:30:22.330 --> 00:30:22.900
Yeah.

497
00:30:22.900 --> 00:30:27.340
And the lists that stilts can do with his body style is infinite.

498
00:30:27.341 --> 00:30:32.250
Still says two things though he is tall and lanky and he has flexible so that's

499
00:30:32.260 --> 00:30:36.430
like he has doubled it.
But I think the tall has the most in their bucket.

500
00:30:36.460 --> 00:30:41.460
I think they definitely have the most options of moves that other humans can't

501
00:30:41.681 --> 00:30:42.190
do and you know,

502
00:30:42.190 --> 00:30:47.190
but again the main thing is to know the main thing is for sure for sure.

503
00:30:47.650 --> 00:30:50.800
That is the,
that is the amazing thing.
A number.

504
00:30:51.340 --> 00:30:55.000
And then the other part of this question is what was the hardest stage of your

505
00:30:55.001 --> 00:30:56.170
Jujitsu journey?

506
00:31:00.370 --> 00:31:03.970
Me,
I would say the whole thing just in completely different ways.

507
00:31:03.990 --> 00:31:07.780
Like the first part is like,
Dang,
you get tired away too quick.

508
00:31:08.080 --> 00:31:13.080
And guys who you know are way smaller than you weigh,

509
00:31:14.051 --> 00:31:16.960
you know,
whatever they new or are beating you up,
you know,

510
00:31:16.961 --> 00:31:17.794
and that kind of thing,

511
00:31:17.800 --> 00:31:22.120
beating you up with no factor whatsoever.

512
00:31:22.900 --> 00:31:24.310
And they're like teaching you,
hey,

513
00:31:24.311 --> 00:31:26.230
this is what you did wrong and you're sitting there all but well,

514
00:31:26.231 --> 00:31:29.980
I mean in my case I was like two 25 when I started and I'm like sitting there

515
00:31:29.981 --> 00:31:34.120
and this little guy,
I don't know if you remember George,
but he um,

516
00:31:34.300 --> 00:31:36.430
he was a little purple belt.
That was,
I was rolling with a lot.

517
00:31:36.431 --> 00:31:39.930
He taught me butterfly guard.
Oh,
Jr yeah.
Yeah.
He's teaching me still.

518
00:31:39.931 --> 00:31:43.360
I'm still seeing there when my big muscles and he's like teaching me stuff so

519
00:31:43.390 --> 00:31:48.220
that can be hard.
I guess I'm getting tired,
but I think,
and then yeah,

520
00:31:48.221 --> 00:31:51.340
you go up blue belt.
In my particular experience,

521
00:31:51.341 --> 00:31:53.390
blue belt was the easiest I think.
Hmm.

522
00:31:53.530 --> 00:31:57.080
Because nothing really was expected of me and blue belts,

523
00:31:57.100 --> 00:32:00.760
a good place at the same time in a way.
Some people,
it's the most frustrating.

524
00:32:01.260 --> 00:32:05.490
But if you're like blue belt,
you're good.
You're,

525
00:32:05.491 --> 00:32:08.680
you're a blue belt.
So people know that you know Jujitsu a little bit,

526
00:32:08.980 --> 00:32:11.210
but you're not expected to tap anybody know.
Yeah.

527
00:32:11.230 --> 00:32:15.040
And if you get tapped out by another blue belt or a purple belt or a brown

528
00:32:15.041 --> 00:32:16.300
bottle of vodka by,
it's no big deal.

529
00:32:16.530 --> 00:32:19.600
You're a blue book and even a white belt taps you and you're like,
yeah.

530
00:32:19.601 --> 00:32:24.540
And you know,
that shouldn't happen.
But yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
totally.
And yeah,
that you,

531
00:32:24.610 --> 00:32:25.690
and you know how,
you know,

532
00:32:25.691 --> 00:32:28.780
when you learn something from the point of not knowing anything and then you

533
00:32:28.781 --> 00:32:29.590
start to learn,

534
00:32:29.590 --> 00:32:33.430
you learn the most quantity wise at the bottom when you start for sure.
You know,

535
00:32:33.431 --> 00:32:36.390
so,
um,
and that's a philosophical way of putting it.

536
00:32:36.410 --> 00:32:40.040
It's a specific way of putting it.
I think there's some in the mid

537
00:32:40.040 --> 00:32:44.900
<v 0>levels where your,
where your mind starts to fill up and you start to be able to</v>

538
00:32:45.420 --> 00:32:50.420
<v 2>really absorb stuff to big giant things.</v>

539
00:32:51.270 --> 00:32:54.660
But in,
as far as DJ,
totally true.
And that's what I mean by like that's a,

540
00:32:54.661 --> 00:32:59.640
that's a way of putting it.
Maybe philosophically,
maybe it's because when you're,

541
00:33:00.060 --> 00:33:04.090
I mean,
quantity wise,
meaning learning the moves in Jujitsu,
you know,
at,

542
00:33:04.100 --> 00:33:05.490
at like black belt,

543
00:33:05.880 --> 00:33:08.280
unless there's these weird special needs that are coming out or whatever,

544
00:33:08.281 --> 00:33:11.790
you know,
all the moves,
you know,
all this stuff.
It's now it's about other stuff.

545
00:33:11.791 --> 00:33:14.780
You got to learn other stuff,
timing,
we'll,
you know,

546
00:33:14.880 --> 00:33:18.840
approaches and all this more like interstitial stuff.
But from a blue belt,

547
00:33:18.841 --> 00:33:22.360
you still like there's moves.
You just don't know every blue belt.
Sure.

548
00:33:22.950 --> 00:33:26.220
So you learn a way quicker if you're interested,
you know,
so you're like,
oh,

549
00:33:26.280 --> 00:33:29.550
I have no answer to this guard pass.
I have no answer.
I'm a blue belt.

550
00:33:29.730 --> 00:33:32.490
Literally no answer to this car pass.
Someone can show you,
oh,

551
00:33:32.491 --> 00:33:34.620
this is how you do it.
You just just block the research and you're like,
oh,

552
00:33:34.770 --> 00:33:38.340
I automatically know.
So you just learn more.
So in my experience,

553
00:33:38.670 --> 00:33:42.750
so I didn't think blue belt was very frustrating at all and I didn't spend much

554
00:33:42.751 --> 00:33:45.270
time to move out.
And then when you hit purple belt,

555
00:33:45.271 --> 00:33:48.510
that's when the learning frustration hits because you're good enough and you

556
00:33:48.511 --> 00:33:52.230
kind of have this weird confidence that's developed and then you and you're,

557
00:33:52.290 --> 00:33:54.450
you're doing so well against all these guys and they just,

558
00:33:54.451 --> 00:33:57.660
you just hit that one level up where you can't do nothing against nobody and

559
00:33:57.661 --> 00:33:58.950
you're just there for a long time.

560
00:33:59.700 --> 00:34:02.760
Cause it's almost like you got to switch over to learning different types of

561
00:34:02.761 --> 00:34:03.350
things.

562
00:34:03.350 --> 00:34:04.700
<v 0>Yeah.
You've got to open your brain up,</v>

563
00:34:04.701 --> 00:34:08.270
open your mind up and open your game up and you got to be vulnerable.

564
00:34:08.390 --> 00:34:11.720
You're not going to learn without making yourself vulnerable from time to time.

565
00:34:11.960 --> 00:34:14.120
Yeah.
And I,
you know,
and again,

566
00:34:14.121 --> 00:34:16.520
there's a good parallel here worth learning about leadership.

567
00:34:16.730 --> 00:34:17.870
I think it's the same thing.
You know,

568
00:34:17.871 --> 00:34:21.740
you come into a leadership position for the first time and it doesn't take long

569
00:34:21.741 --> 00:34:23.060
before you're like,
okay I kind of got this.

570
00:34:23.061 --> 00:34:24.450
And that's like your blue belt phase where you,

571
00:34:24.451 --> 00:34:29.451
you start feeling light and then the more people you get to command or the

572
00:34:31.460 --> 00:34:33.650
senior leadership positions you get put into,

573
00:34:33.651 --> 00:34:35.300
or the harder situations you get put into,

574
00:34:35.301 --> 00:34:38.840
you realize that all you got to continue to exercise your mind.

575
00:34:38.841 --> 00:34:39.950
You've got to continue to grow.

576
00:34:39.951 --> 00:34:44.951
You got to continue to try and absorb new information and try new strategies and

577
00:34:45.021 --> 00:34:48.170
tactics and still stick with the fundamentals.
Cause that's,

578
00:34:48.171 --> 00:34:50.980
that's one thing that,
you know,
the,
the fundamentals of Jujitsu,

579
00:34:51.230 --> 00:34:55.100
they're fundamentally the same from white belt to black belt.

580
00:34:55.700 --> 00:35:00.080
And yet there they change and there's times you break those rules and they're

581
00:35:00.081 --> 00:35:02.330
nuanced.
And it's the same thing with being in a leadership position.

582
00:35:02.331 --> 00:35:06.170
The fundamentals don't change.
But then how are those,

583
00:35:06.440 --> 00:35:11.440
how are those fundamental principles nuanced to handle these different

584
00:35:12.651 --> 00:35:13.260
situations?

585
00:35:13.260 --> 00:35:17.940
<v 2>It's very challenging.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
that's true.</v>

586
00:35:17.980 --> 00:35:21.360
And Brown belt to me is more the same as purple belt,

587
00:35:21.361 --> 00:35:25.170
but just more like refined,
you know,
so it's,

588
00:35:25.650 --> 00:35:27.690
it's like less of the frustration,

589
00:35:27.691 --> 00:35:30.060
but the frustration becomes like more conscious.

590
00:35:30.440 --> 00:35:34.280
<v 0>You know what's crazy for me,
and I don't know if this is just,
you know,</v>

591
00:35:34.281 --> 00:35:38.310
when you remember back in the past,
like you forget the bad stuff

592
00:35:38.370 --> 00:35:41.580
<v 2>of the past.
Sure.
Do you know what I mean?
Doesn't everyone do that?</v>

593
00:35:43.120 --> 00:35:45.320
Depends on the bed,
but yeah.
Yeah.
I mean I know that

594
00:35:45.460 --> 00:35:48.460
<v 3>set all.
Yeah.
When we were in high school,
everything was great.
Right?
Or Hey,</v>

595
00:35:48.461 --> 00:35:50.800
when we went to college,
everything was great.
Or you know,

596
00:35:50.810 --> 00:35:52.570
in the seal teams you go all you had that deployment was great.

597
00:35:52.571 --> 00:35:56.230
We forget about all the hard stuff on our deployment or any one that was bad or

598
00:35:56.231 --> 00:35:59.920
whatever.
Didn't work out the way you wanted it to.
I don't know if it's that,

599
00:35:59.980 --> 00:36:03.610
but when I talk about the hardest stage of my Jujitsu jury journey,

600
00:36:03.670 --> 00:36:08.470
it's one big blur of fun.
There's nothing where I think back,
wow,

601
00:36:08.471 --> 00:36:11.110
I was frustrated.
The [inaudible].
No Man,
I never had that feeling.

602
00:36:11.440 --> 00:36:14.680
I go home from the gym every time.
Kind of like good,
good day at training,

603
00:36:14.681 --> 00:36:17.020
but that was fun.
That was cool that I learned this or man,

604
00:36:17.021 --> 00:36:19.660
I can't believe I got a copy of that guy.
He's getting good or whatever.
You know,

605
00:36:19.680 --> 00:36:24.430
you just kind of,
I don't have like these,
these hard stages to me.

606
00:36:24.790 --> 00:36:27.820
Maybe I'm just a person that really enjoys it a lot,
I guess.

607
00:36:27.920 --> 00:36:31.670
<v 2>Yeah.
And I,
and I,
I would say that that's most people.</v>

608
00:36:32.300 --> 00:36:35.240
I think so too.
I think I'm the same boat and you know,
for,

609
00:36:35.280 --> 00:36:38.840
you use the term frustration lot more.
And I've actually,
you know,
I don't,

610
00:36:38.930 --> 00:36:40.820
I don't want to bring this out in the public audience,

611
00:36:40.821 --> 00:36:44.210
but I actually have seen you get frustrated from time to time.

612
00:36:44.760 --> 00:36:48.590
Well those are like really funny way of getting frustrated to ever I then I seen

613
00:36:48.591 --> 00:36:51.680
the same thing with you when,
Oh,
you want me to say?
Okay,

614
00:36:51.710 --> 00:36:55.410
one time you were rolling with Dean and Dean had you,

615
00:36:55.500 --> 00:36:59.030
you know how like dino get ahead of you psychologically and he'll be like,

616
00:36:59.060 --> 00:36:59.421
oh yeah.

617
00:36:59.421 --> 00:37:02.780
And he'll like be baiting you and laughing and stuff and then the more he lasts,

618
00:37:02.781 --> 00:37:04.850
less you left.
So you're getting really mad.

619
00:37:04.851 --> 00:37:07.550
And I remember he was doing this thing where you get stood up and you were like,

620
00:37:07.940 --> 00:37:11.090
you look like you were just tired of what's going on and you're tired of it and

621
00:37:11.091 --> 00:37:14.020
you're turning up the heat.
And Dean who was just like,
okay,
and then he like Lee,

622
00:37:14.080 --> 00:37:16.610
okay,
this is what he did.
He leaned against the wall kind of like,

623
00:37:16.640 --> 00:37:19.790
oh you can't take me not him against the wall and you engage or what have you

624
00:37:19.791 --> 00:37:21.710
guys went down and he got you.

625
00:37:21.711 --> 00:37:25.280
I think you got you with arm bar and I remember it was armored because I

626
00:37:25.281 --> 00:37:25.940
remember thinking,

627
00:37:25.940 --> 00:37:29.090
I don't think I've ever seen Jocko get tapped out be with the arm bar.

628
00:37:29.120 --> 00:37:32.510
I can see like a flintlock someone like jumped in con but he got you in the

629
00:37:32.511 --> 00:37:37.290
armor and you were like,
Duh.
You were frustrated on the last,
I was like a,

630
00:37:37.390 --> 00:37:41.820
we could call them micro frustration overall there.

631
00:37:41.960 --> 00:37:46.400
These are like little challenges.
That frustration though.

632
00:37:47.420 --> 00:37:51.770
Is it possible for it to be called frustration?
If it brings me joy,

633
00:37:52.490 --> 00:37:53.330
is it possible?

634
00:37:53.331 --> 00:37:58.331
Because even in the depths of like frustration and I feel good even though I'm

635
00:38:00.291 --> 00:38:02.000
tapped out.
Yeah.

636
00:38:02.120 --> 00:38:06.500
Especially when you can reflect on it and that's why I think you said what or

637
00:38:06.501 --> 00:38:09.440
when you said,
um,
uh,
you forget about the bad things.

638
00:38:09.650 --> 00:38:13.070
You forget about the bad things in a certain kind of discourse.

639
00:38:13.130 --> 00:38:17.180
If you regard that overall discourse as being a good thing,

640
00:38:17.181 --> 00:38:19.400
then you'll start to forget about things and vice versa.

641
00:38:19.520 --> 00:38:22.910
But I never go home and say like,
Oh man,

642
00:38:22.911 --> 00:38:26.360
I can't believe that I couldn't get out of there.
I just couldn't do anything.

643
00:38:26.510 --> 00:38:29.760
At least it's,
I don't remember.
Yeah,
yeah.
Going back,

644
00:38:29.770 --> 00:38:31.760
got to have that feeling of there somewhere.
Yeah.
It has to be.

645
00:38:31.761 --> 00:38:33.590
And really what they are or just the,

646
00:38:33.591 --> 00:38:37.040
the challenges that are specific to certain stages and these are just,

647
00:38:37.120 --> 00:38:40.930
these are real general things that probably apply to it,
you know,

648
00:38:41.020 --> 00:38:43.510
to everybody in one way or another in the stages.

649
00:38:44.660 --> 00:38:47.350
It's the same thing with leadership.
Like most of the time,

650
00:38:47.560 --> 00:38:50.080
even though I've been some situations where I was like,
man,

651
00:38:50.081 --> 00:38:52.300
I didn't do a good job there.
I could done better.

652
00:38:53.170 --> 00:38:57.760
Normally I'm not frustrated where I was working for somebody that wasn't letting

653
00:38:57.761 --> 00:39:02.620
me do what I wanted to do and I had more maneuvering to do to get where I needed

654
00:39:02.621 --> 00:39:06.700
to be.
Didn't get frustrated.
Enjoy that game I the game.

655
00:39:07.420 --> 00:39:10.000
Yeah.
Micro frustrations.

656
00:39:10.980 --> 00:39:13.000
They're like micro tears in your muscle.

657
00:39:13.210 --> 00:39:16.840
You feel them but they're offered like benefit for overall make you stronger in

658
00:39:16.841 --> 00:39:20.880
the long run.
They're not injuries.
Awesome.

659
00:39:21.330 --> 00:39:24.490
Next question.
Next question.
Jocko.

660
00:39:25.210 --> 00:39:29.410
You've talked about how getting into into adversarial relationships is
pointless,

661
00:39:29.560 --> 00:39:32.980
but people always get into adversarial relationships with me.

662
00:39:34.720 --> 00:39:38.350
I've been told I'm scary before but never understood why.

663
00:39:38.800 --> 00:39:43.800
My question is how do I maneuver on this without acting like a little weakling

664
00:39:44.620 --> 00:39:49.000
bitch for lack of a better term,
to appear less threatening.

665
00:39:49.930 --> 00:39:53.110
Do I just accept that I rubbed people the wrong way?

666
00:39:55.660 --> 00:40:00.660
<v 0>So this is a question and I'll do my best to answer cause it's time for</v>

667
00:40:02.051 --> 00:40:05.860
definitely time for some self awareness here for the individual asking this

668
00:40:05.861 --> 00:40:10.600
question.
It sounds like you are,
you know,

669
00:40:10.601 --> 00:40:14.230
a big abrasive person that is aggressive and intimidates people.

670
00:40:14.560 --> 00:40:17.500
And I know what it's like to be that person because I could be,

671
00:40:18.220 --> 00:40:21.020
I could come across as intimidating.
I know that,
um,

672
00:40:21.160 --> 00:40:23.800
I can definitely come across as aggressive.
I can be aggressive,

673
00:40:23.801 --> 00:40:28.300
I am aggressive in many ways,
abrasive.
I don't know that not necessarily.

674
00:40:28.510 --> 00:40:29.430
<v 1>MMM.
Um,</v>

675
00:40:31.540 --> 00:40:36.540
<v 0>categorizes me because I'm very cautious about not being abrasive because if I'm</v>

676
00:40:37.841 --> 00:40:40.840
being abrasive with people and my building a relationship under making any

677
00:40:40.841 --> 00:40:43.090
progress,
the answer's obviously no.
So something,

678
00:40:43.420 --> 00:40:46.960
the thing is when I hear this type of question,

679
00:40:48.930 --> 00:40:53.450
I,
I think that there's some little bit of insecurity going on here,
right?
Some,

680
00:40:53.470 --> 00:40:58.090
a little bit of,
hey that's not an insult.
That's what I sense.

681
00:40:58.540 --> 00:41:00.700
Cause everyone's got insecurities.
I do.

682
00:41:00.850 --> 00:41:03.790
Everybody does and but,

683
00:41:03.791 --> 00:41:06.370
but the fact that you asked this question,

684
00:41:06.400 --> 00:41:10.510
I'm hoping that that means you want to make some kind of improvement,
right?

685
00:41:10.540 --> 00:41:14.680
Do you want to get better?
And,
you know,

686
00:41:14.710 --> 00:41:19.630
I'm a little worried that you might just be looking for like reinforcement cause

687
00:41:19.631 --> 00:41:23.290
people think jock was big and aggressive.
So if I say I'm big and aggressive,

688
00:41:23.291 --> 00:41:25.150
I'll,
you know,
Jack was just going to say,
Hey,

689
00:41:25.151 --> 00:41:28.900
those people are just scared of you and they don't deserve your mercy or you

690
00:41:28.901 --> 00:41:32.950
don't.
You do.
You use your intimidation factor.
Overrun those people,
right?

691
00:41:32.960 --> 00:41:37.880
That might be what you're looking for,
but you're not going to get that here.

692
00:41:37.881 --> 00:41:39.010
And the reason you're not gonna get that here,

693
00:41:39.040 --> 00:41:40.670
cause that's not going to help you.

694
00:41:41.090 --> 00:41:43.730
It's not going to help you achieve your goals.

695
00:41:44.540 --> 00:41:47.900
And you talk about people being scared of you.

696
00:41:47.901 --> 00:41:52.700
But the fact likely is,
is that you're the one that scared

697
00:41:54.170 --> 00:41:56.480
in,
in you actually said it yourself,

698
00:41:56.510 --> 00:42:00.170
that you don't want to appear to be weak.

699
00:42:01.010 --> 00:42:04.150
You don't want to appear to be a bitch,
right?

700
00:42:04.760 --> 00:42:09.200
That is that feeling.
That's fear.

701
00:42:10.250 --> 00:42:15.050
That's fear.
It's fear of looking weak.
It's fear of looking wrong.

702
00:42:15.051 --> 00:42:19.010
It's fear of failure and it's fear of vulnerability.

703
00:42:20.420 --> 00:42:25.040
And those are,
those are real,
those are real.

704
00:42:26.060 --> 00:42:30.530
And if you're,
you know,
everybody should be feeling those fears.
I at some level,

705
00:42:30.800 --> 00:42:33.830
but you have to overcome those fears.
If you don't,

706
00:42:34.340 --> 00:42:37.040
then how are you ever going to step up if you're,

707
00:42:37.041 --> 00:42:40.790
if you're too afraid to be wrong,
how are you ever going to answer a question?

708
00:42:41.360 --> 00:42:44.060
If you're too afraid to

709
00:42:46.230 --> 00:42:50.220
look weak,
how are you ever going to exposures?
Any weaknesses?

710
00:42:50.460 --> 00:42:51.810
And if you don't expose any weaknesses,

711
00:42:51.811 --> 00:42:54.630
well just build a bunker around yourself and sit in there by herself.
You know?

712
00:42:55.530 --> 00:42:59.340
So as a leader,
we know that up and down the chain of command,

713
00:42:59.341 --> 00:43:02.550
you need to develop relationships,
right?
That's what,

714
00:43:02.580 --> 00:43:04.260
that's what you're supposed to do.

715
00:43:05.040 --> 00:43:07.500
That means you need to communicate with people.

716
00:43:07.560 --> 00:43:12.300
That means you need to talk and you need to listen and you need to develop
trust.

717
00:43:12.720 --> 00:43:17.720
And one of the best ways to develop trust with other people is by exposing some

718
00:43:18.601 --> 00:43:23.090
vulnerability
by Saint Hack on,

719
00:43:23.180 --> 00:43:26.300
I'm not quite sure how to do this,
or hey,
echo,
hey,
can you,

720
00:43:26.301 --> 00:43:28.250
can you help me with this issue I have going on here?

721
00:43:28.310 --> 00:43:29.390
I don't know how to solve it.

722
00:43:31.750 --> 00:43:36.750
That's ways that you build trust and thereby build relationships.

723
00:43:39.070 --> 00:43:42.820
And it's hard to do that because you don't want to look stupid.

724
00:43:42.821 --> 00:43:43.810
You don't want to look weak.

725
00:43:43.811 --> 00:43:48.811
You don't want to admit you don't know something because you want to be Mr.

726
00:43:48.850 --> 00:43:53.300
Strong and know everything
in.

727
00:43:53.301 --> 00:43:56.060
So you're probably putting up a front,

728
00:43:57.480 --> 00:44:00.160
an aggressive front and abrasive front.

729
00:44:01.690 --> 00:44:06.310
It's a wall to keep people intimidated.
And then in your mind you think,

730
00:44:06.340 --> 00:44:10.660
it's not my fault,
it's their fault because they're scared of me.

731
00:44:10.661 --> 00:44:13.630
It's their fault because I'm so intimidating.

732
00:44:16.150 --> 00:44:20.950
So that is not good.
And then you get the,
you're kind of closing statement.

733
00:44:20.951 --> 00:44:24.310
Should you just accept that I rub people the wrong way?
You can.

734
00:44:25.880 --> 00:44:27.800
You can't accept that you rub people the wrong way,

735
00:44:27.830 --> 00:44:30.560
but then you might as well accept right then and there that you're never going

736
00:44:30.561 --> 00:44:32.760
to be a true leader.
That's,

737
00:44:32.761 --> 00:44:35.640
you're never going to build any relationships that you're never going to inspire

738
00:44:35.641 --> 00:44:40.380
anybody.
And you're never going to be the leader of a bad ass unified,

739
00:44:41.070 --> 00:44:42.480
high performing team,

740
00:44:44.370 --> 00:44:48.450
<v 1>probably not worth it.
And</v>

741
00:44:50.340 --> 00:44:52.290
the the better thing to do

742
00:44:54.200 --> 00:44:56.330
<v 0>is to humble yourself.</v>

743
00:44:57.290 --> 00:44:57.730
<v 1>Okay.</v>

744
00:44:57.730 --> 00:45:02.730
<v 0>Is to open yourself up to the pain and the discomfort of displaying weakness and</v>

745
00:45:06.130 --> 00:45:08.080
error and failure

746
00:45:11.550 --> 00:45:12.383
<v 1>and</v>

747
00:45:12.970 --> 00:45:17.970
<v 0>open yourself up to try and be nice to other people</v>

748
00:45:20.380 --> 00:45:23.200
instead of being scared of what's going to happen if you expose yourself,

749
00:45:23.290 --> 00:45:24.460
go ahead and throw it out there.

750
00:45:24.970 --> 00:45:26.990
<v 1>We act</v>

751
00:45:27.460 --> 00:45:30.640
<v 0>pleasant to them so they talk to you without fear.</v>

752
00:45:31.510 --> 00:45:35.920
And in doing those things,
you can overcome whatever these insecurities are.

753
00:45:36.730 --> 00:45:39.190
And I don't know what the insecures you have.
It could be any number of things.

754
00:45:39.191 --> 00:45:40.900
Maybe you don't think you're smart as they are.

755
00:45:41.080 --> 00:45:43.210
Maybe you don't think you're as well educated as they are.

756
00:45:43.390 --> 00:45:44.620
Maybe you don't think that they have.

757
00:45:44.621 --> 00:45:47.350
You have the strategic vision that they have,
whatever those insecurities are,

758
00:45:47.380 --> 00:45:50.530
it's all good.
We all got him,
no big deal.

759
00:45:51.430 --> 00:45:54.520
But if you stop hiding them and you own them,

760
00:45:56.630 --> 00:46:01.630
you will become not only a better leader,

761
00:46:04.170 --> 00:46:05.840
but to become a better man.

762
00:46:09.550 --> 00:46:12.550
<v 1>So
take a breath</v>

763
00:46:14.620 --> 00:46:19.180
and get home
and take another crack at this gig.

764
00:46:21.100 --> 00:46:21.933
You know?

765
00:46:22.570 --> 00:46:25.980
<v 0>Well,
I think losing your temper is a huge red flag.
Like I've always said,</v>

766
00:46:25.981 --> 00:46:28.860
and always will see huge red flag if you ever lose your temper,

767
00:46:29.070 --> 00:46:30.330
and I'm nothing screaming,
yell.

768
00:46:30.331 --> 00:46:34.590
I'm just saying you're getting mad at displaying that anger.
Well,
what's really,

769
00:46:34.800 --> 00:46:39.800
what's really what's really bad is when people utilize their temper as a tool to

770
00:46:41.580 --> 00:46:43.980
scare and intimidate people.
So they go,
Oh man,

771
00:46:43.981 --> 00:46:46.440
I don't want to say anything to Jocko on this cause you've got to go loses and

772
00:46:46.530 --> 00:46:50.460
loses his temper and his mind go crazy like that.
That's,

773
00:46:50.490 --> 00:46:52.290
that's me using it as a tool,

774
00:46:53.760 --> 00:46:56.670
which is not good because you're not building any relationship,

775
00:46:56.671 --> 00:46:58.320
so you're not getting any input from people.

776
00:46:59.010 --> 00:46:59.590
<v 1>Okay.</v>

777
00:46:59.590 --> 00:47:01.540
<v 0>You're,
you're not respected.
By the way.</v>

778
00:47:02.140 --> 00:47:05.380
People might fear you if you have a bad temper,
but they don't respect you.

779
00:47:06.010 --> 00:47:08.500
They're not calling you up and asking you for advice.

780
00:47:08.980 --> 00:47:13.480
They're not wanting you to run their,
their project.
Yeah.

781
00:47:13.510 --> 00:47:17.350
No,
and they're not motivated to do good by you when you're not around.

782
00:47:17.620 --> 00:47:21.370
They are definitely not motivated to do good by you and you're not around it.

783
00:47:21.400 --> 00:47:24.140
In fact,
the only reason they do anything is out of fear.
You.

784
00:47:25.150 --> 00:47:27.010
Whereas if you have a relationship with them,

785
00:47:27.040 --> 00:47:32.020
you could leave for six months and the people that know you and respect you and

786
00:47:32.021 --> 00:47:34.000
care about you and have relating to their still Boston,

787
00:47:34.001 --> 00:47:35.620
they're asked to do the best they can for you.

788
00:47:35.810 --> 00:47:40.260
<v 2>Yep.
Glad when you come back to yeah.
Yeah.
In,</v>

789
00:47:40.280 --> 00:47:45.110
in a lot of times like we'll get still the adversarial relationship thing,

790
00:47:47.440 --> 00:47:50.840
a way to look at it as it kind of takes both of you to kind of cultivate an

791
00:47:50.841 --> 00:47:54.460
adversarial relationship,
goes,
go through any kind of relationship,
but it's,
well,

792
00:47:54.700 --> 00:47:59.610
no,
yes and no.
It will.
Okay.
So here,
um,
you,

793
00:47:59.670 --> 00:48:02.180
you keep being a dick to me.
We'll see.

794
00:48:02.570 --> 00:48:05.570
And if I just keep being nice to you,

795
00:48:06.200 --> 00:48:07.610
even though you're being a dick to me,

796
00:48:07.611 --> 00:48:09.170
even though we have a job to do what it yes.

797
00:48:09.190 --> 00:48:11.500
All in all of that and we're maintaining the integrity of that.
Um,

798
00:48:11.540 --> 00:48:13.880
but I'm keep being nice to you.
You keep being a dick to me.

799
00:48:13.881 --> 00:48:18.140
I keep being nice to you after a while.
The way that shakes itself out is,

800
00:48:19.150 --> 00:48:23.680
um,
be nice,
you know,
the next person.
Yeah,
no,
well,
here's the thing.

801
00:48:23.681 --> 00:48:26.750
We're still getting the job done and whatever,
but my reason,
my response to you,

802
00:48:26.751 --> 00:48:30.470
if you'd be a dick to me is not be a dick back or defend.
You know,

803
00:48:30.590 --> 00:48:32.870
it's just be nice.
Oh,
you know,
it's a,

804
00:48:32.871 --> 00:48:35.390
where are you going to say it shakes out as it shakes out.

805
00:48:35.930 --> 00:48:38.300
The one guy who's a Dick stands out.

806
00:48:40.690 --> 00:48:43.630
So everyone's been cool.
And when all is said and done,

807
00:48:43.900 --> 00:48:48.010
we're just dealing with one guy is a dick.
So if you,
if,

808
00:48:48.310 --> 00:48:51.790
if you cultivate the adversarial relationship,
it's like,
okay,

809
00:48:51.791 --> 00:48:54.880
you have this competitive situation now to people that you know,

810
00:48:54.930 --> 00:48:57.940
or Dick or guys that are jerks,
which ended up with,
yeah,

811
00:48:57.941 --> 00:48:59.500
and let's say you were a nice guy to begin with.

812
00:49:01.160 --> 00:49:05.600
Don't become a a jerk now.
You know,
it's true.

813
00:49:05.860 --> 00:49:09.440
So,
and I'm say that because a lot of times if you're like,
hey,
people were Cree,

814
00:49:09.520 --> 00:49:12.140
uh,
creating adversarial relationships with me,

815
00:49:14.420 --> 00:49:16.730
you're going to play a part in that relationship.

816
00:49:17.020 --> 00:49:21.970
<v 0>Yeah.
Yeah.
And,
and the thing with this question,
and you know,
I mean,</v>

817
00:49:21.971 --> 00:49:25.150
even the terminology used,
which,
which is,
you know,

818
00:49:25.180 --> 00:49:29.210
how do I maneuver on this without acting like a little bitch?
Yeah,
yeah.

819
00:49:29.320 --> 00:49:33.160
Literally.
So you gotta figure,
not,
not,
you know,

820
00:49:33.161 --> 00:49:36.560
not the most mature person.
So I'm,
I'm guessing,
hey man,
you're probably 22,

821
00:49:36.760 --> 00:49:38.770
you know,
24 something like that,

822
00:49:38.800 --> 00:49:43.540
or you're having matured a lot and you're 27 but you're still caught in that

823
00:49:43.840 --> 00:49:47.550
enact game.
And I think a lot of times,
you know,
uh,

824
00:49:47.980 --> 00:49:51.250
people when they,
when they meet me or they,

825
00:49:51.390 --> 00:49:55.180
they learn about me or I show up at their business,

826
00:49:55.390 --> 00:49:58.090
they think I'm going to be that guy that's like,

827
00:49:58.091 --> 00:50:00.910
we're going to just come in here and,
and it's,

828
00:50:00.940 --> 00:50:05.110
it's always really cool when people go,
man,
yeah,

829
00:50:05.111 --> 00:50:09.070
I didn't think of that.
It's,
Oh,
you have this approach that we didn't expect.

830
00:50:09.070 --> 00:50:13.210
And I'm like,
yeah,
you know,
and by now most people kind of,
you know,

831
00:50:13.360 --> 00:50:16.190
at this stage and echelon front,
and when I show up some work,

832
00:50:16.200 --> 00:50:19.060
people have listened to park as they know where I'm coming from now.

833
00:50:19.330 --> 00:50:21.610
But you know,
two years ago,
you know,

834
00:50:21.611 --> 00:50:26.420
they expected this big sergeant slaughter type thing to go down these folks in a

835
00:50:26.440 --> 00:50:28.010
whip,
these people in shape.
And,

836
00:50:28.011 --> 00:50:32.360
and my guess is that the individual that asks this question was kind of thinking

837
00:50:32.390 --> 00:50:33.980
he would get some moral support from me.

838
00:50:34.730 --> 00:50:37.640
And I'm trying to give them moral support cause I want her to be successful

839
00:50:37.641 --> 00:50:39.860
because I want him to go out and dominate in the world.

840
00:50:39.950 --> 00:50:44.150
But to go out and dominate in the world,
you have to be a a chess player,

841
00:50:44.480 --> 00:50:46.160
not a checkers player.
You gotta,

842
00:50:46.161 --> 00:50:49.850
you gotta think you gotta use the relationships.

843
00:50:49.850 --> 00:50:53.450
You've got to use indirect warfare to go out there and be blunt force trauma and

844
00:50:53.451 --> 00:50:57.200
everybody,
it'll get you,
it'll get you,
you know,

845
00:50:57.740 --> 00:51:01.640
it'll get you a quarter of the way there if you're lucky.

846
00:51:02.120 --> 00:51:05.000
And then it'll,
it won't get you the rest of the way.
So just,
just,

847
00:51:05.001 --> 00:51:08.900
it's no big deal,
man.
You're young.
You got some learning to do.
That's awesome.

848
00:51:09.170 --> 00:51:11.870
I wish I would have been smart enough to ask this question when I was a young,

849
00:51:11.871 --> 00:51:15.560
stupid 23 year old.
You got some,
you're thinking,

850
00:51:15.561 --> 00:51:18.620
you recognize that you're in a situation,
so all you gotta do is just,
uh,

851
00:51:19.430 --> 00:51:20.960
just start taking a different approach,

852
00:51:20.961 --> 00:51:23.540
a little bit more of an indirect approach,
a little bit more of an open mind,

853
00:51:23.541 --> 00:51:26.880
a little bit more humility.
Don't worry about looking weak when you,

854
00:51:26.990 --> 00:51:31.780
the people that are scared to look weak are the people that are weak,

855
00:51:31.880 --> 00:51:36.320
right?
The people that are okay being exposed are the people that are strong.

856
00:51:36.980 --> 00:51:39.830
Like I'm totally comfortable in my leadership capabilities.

857
00:51:39.890 --> 00:51:42.500
So when I have an issue,
I'm like,
Hey,
I don't feel comfortable about this.

858
00:51:42.620 --> 00:51:44.450
I'm not worried that somebody's not going to say like,
oh,

859
00:51:44.451 --> 00:51:47.000
well we don't think you can handle this,
that,
no,
no,
no.
I actually,
I know I can.

860
00:51:47.540 --> 00:51:49.500
I've been in worse situations.
So when he got,
yeah.

861
00:51:49.730 --> 00:51:53.690
So if you're paranoid about looking weak,
a means you probably are weak.

862
00:51:53.960 --> 00:51:56.450
If you don't care about being looking weak,

863
00:51:56.451 --> 00:52:01.070
it probably means that you're coming along.
You're doing pretty good.
Solid.
Yeah.

864
00:52:03.950 --> 00:52:04.783
Chick.

865
00:52:05.350 --> 00:52:08.920
<v 2>So you don't need a hard shell if you have a hardcore,</v>

866
00:52:10.060 --> 00:52:13.180
but you need a hard shell.
If you have a soft core.
Yes.

867
00:52:13.181 --> 00:52:17.590
That is true kind of thing.
Yes.
Did you just make that up?
Yeah,

868
00:52:17.620 --> 00:52:21.010
but I mean,
I'm not looking at it like,
Dang,
that was deep.
I'm not,

869
00:52:21.130 --> 00:52:23.050
I'm not thinking that.
But that is a true

870
00:52:23.160 --> 00:52:24.180
<v 0>your statement.
If you're,</v>

871
00:52:24.181 --> 00:52:29.181
if you're fundamentally sound on the internal and the meaningful structure of

872
00:52:32.011 --> 00:52:36.170
your,
of your being,
then your can withstand attacks.

873
00:52:36.180 --> 00:52:39.130
So you don't need to put up a big wall.
Right,
right.
You know,

874
00:52:39.150 --> 00:52:43.920
but if you're fundamentally weak internally and the fundamentals of your,

875
00:52:44.130 --> 00:52:48.570
of your being are weak,
then you need to put up a big wall of protection.

876
00:52:48.620 --> 00:52:50.960
You need to go round and blow up to people.
And

877
00:52:51.320 --> 00:52:56.250
<v 2>Yeah,
you made me do some weapons out there to really keep them away from guns.</v>

878
00:52:56.710 --> 00:52:57.543
Some heavy.
Yeah.

879
00:52:59.460 --> 00:53:01.080
<v 0>Nice.
All right,
good.</v>

880
00:53:01.940 --> 00:53:02.773
<v 2>Next question.</v>

881
00:53:04.610 --> 00:53:09.610
We'd love to hear tips for moving to wake up earlier alarms and not disturbing

882
00:53:11.211 --> 00:53:14.060
your spouse.
Keeping an alert throughout the day.
You know,

883
00:53:14.061 --> 00:53:16.520
when you wake up early this,
these are,
yeah,
these are thing.

884
00:53:16.760 --> 00:53:20.840
So tips for managing the implications around making that change to get up

885
00:53:20.841 --> 00:53:25.290
earlier while keeping the space or the keeping the speed or keeping the peace at

886
00:53:25.291 --> 00:53:26.310
home and work

887
00:53:26.460 --> 00:53:30.530
<v 0>and working.
You put that work yet.
So Ma,</v>

888
00:53:31.170 --> 00:53:35.190
he then made a typo or he's,
or he's on the inside.
What that is,

889
00:53:35.470 --> 00:53:39.750
is that's the homage to the Portuguese accent.
Yes,
it was.
Well,
no,
it's,

890
00:53:39.810 --> 00:53:44.550
it's a whole march to the fake Portuguese accent.
No,
it's the real one.

891
00:53:44.640 --> 00:53:49.570
Worki anything adding like he like it,

892
00:53:49.571 --> 00:53:51.060
it'll come out.
Oh yeah.

893
00:53:52.560 --> 00:53:57.550
It can be exaggerated though by certain people myself recruited.
Uh,

894
00:53:57.730 --> 00:54:00.890
okay,
so,
so how do wake up in the morning?
Number one,
let's,

895
00:54:00.960 --> 00:54:02.850
let's talk about one important piece of this.

896
00:54:02.851 --> 00:54:05.190
How do you do it without disturbing the spouse?

897
00:54:05.730 --> 00:54:08.580
Because we don't wanna we don't wanna make the spouse angry.

898
00:54:08.640 --> 00:54:12.370
No adversarial relationships with this bus at four 30 to four 30.

899
00:54:12.510 --> 00:54:16.860
So one of the things,
real,
real easy,
one out of the gate get an escalating alarm.

900
00:54:17.130 --> 00:54:20.250
So what that means is it starts off quiet.
Sure.
And it gets louder.

901
00:54:20.280 --> 00:54:21.570
It gets progressively louder.

902
00:54:22.530 --> 00:54:25.830
I am a much lighter sleeper than my wife.

903
00:54:26.220 --> 00:54:30.990
So this is not that big of a deal to me and I can't answer,

904
00:54:32.240 --> 00:54:35.550
but I've,
I've,
I've slept with roommates that one to sleep,
you know,

905
00:54:35.670 --> 00:54:38.970
like in the military,
you know,
you got,
you got bunked together or whatever.

906
00:54:40.500 --> 00:54:43.290
So I've dealt with this a little bit,
but it's really no factor.

907
00:54:43.320 --> 00:54:47.960
Did an escalating alarm.
And then when that thing goes off,
um,
you,

908
00:54:47.970 --> 00:54:50.250
you wake up before it gets too loud to wake your spouse,

909
00:54:50.251 --> 00:54:53.970
that should be on your side of the bed so you can make it happen or you can pick

910
00:54:53.971 --> 00:54:58.320
a song that starts off nice and mellow and that kind of builds.

911
00:54:58.950 --> 00:55:03.660
And for a long time,
for this particular reason,
I used to have,

912
00:55:03.690 --> 00:55:04.523
um,

913
00:55:04.710 --> 00:55:09.710
there's a band called the sword and they have a song called Iron Swan.

914
00:55:10.980 --> 00:55:15.960
And it starts off nice and mellow.
And if you don't get up in time,
it's common.

915
00:55:16.500 --> 00:55:17.333
So you got it.

916
00:55:18.100 --> 00:55:22.530
So it's like kind of like a game within the game right there where you got to

917
00:55:22.531 --> 00:55:24.890
beat the clock.
Yes.
Yes.
You gotta beat the clock.

918
00:55:24.920 --> 00:55:29.390
You've got to get up and turn that thing because otherwise it's an aunt and
then,

919
00:55:29.640 --> 00:55:34.320
and then you're too late.
What is it?
Black Swan?
No Iron Swan.
It's the source.

920
00:55:35.230 --> 00:55:36.900
Yeah.
Cause there's,

921
00:55:36.901 --> 00:55:41.901
there's times in my life where I will put like the ultimate shocker of a tune in

922
00:55:44.701 --> 00:55:46.140
my,
um,

923
00:55:47.510 --> 00:55:51.060
in my playlist that if I need to get up and I need to get up and get on it,

924
00:55:51.120 --> 00:55:56.120
like there's a song called repeat repeat process by 100 demons.

925
00:55:57.750 --> 00:56:01.530
That song will get you out of bed.
He will get you out of bed.
When it kicks in.

926
00:56:01.530 --> 00:56:04.500
It just comes,
it comes in.
It's like,
it's like getting,

927
00:56:04.850 --> 00:56:09.390
it's like an explosion happens in your room and it's a great song by a great

928
00:56:09.391 --> 00:56:12.000
band.
But anyways,
so if,

929
00:56:12.030 --> 00:56:14.700
but in this case you don't want to go with a hundred demons,

930
00:56:15.210 --> 00:56:19.950
you don't want to go with repeat par process.
You want to go with the sword,
iron,

931
00:56:19.960 --> 00:56:24.010
sand or an escalating alarm.
Now once you do that,

932
00:56:24.040 --> 00:56:26.200
you got to have the gear pre staged.

933
00:56:26.260 --> 00:56:29.050
The gear has the morning gear has to be pre-staged.

934
00:56:29.230 --> 00:56:31.570
So we're not in the dress that we're not pulling.

935
00:56:31.571 --> 00:56:34.720
Open drawers are not flipping on lights are not searching for stuff.
No,

936
00:56:34.721 --> 00:56:38.530
we get up,
we walk out of the room.
Yeah,
quietly.
Stealth mode.

937
00:56:39.130 --> 00:56:43.630
Then you get to either the bathroom.
Now if you have the bathroom on sweet,

938
00:56:44.020 --> 00:56:47.050
maybe you have some stuff staged in the other bathroom in the house.

939
00:56:47.110 --> 00:56:49.510
So he just walked right out of the room,
shut the door and you're good.

940
00:56:49.720 --> 00:56:53.950
You made your escape,
you know.
Oh and I'll tell you another thing,

941
00:56:54.230 --> 00:56:57.880
little heads up.
Make sure that you set off your secondary,

942
00:56:58.030 --> 00:57:01.000
I mean that you turn off your secondary and your tertiary alarms.

943
00:57:01.210 --> 00:57:04.150
So if you're like me and you sleep with multiple alarm clocks,

944
00:57:05.020 --> 00:57:08.290
if you leave cause they go off sequentially.
Right.
You know,

945
00:57:08.291 --> 00:57:11.410
you got your first one iPhone,
then you got your second one battery power,

946
00:57:11.411 --> 00:57:12.640
then you've got your third one wind up.

947
00:57:12.641 --> 00:57:17.190
The windup has the gnarly last one with the
right.

948
00:57:17.510 --> 00:57:19.750
Right.
If you leave that thing,

949
00:57:20.380 --> 00:57:22.450
if you forget to shut that thing off before you walk out,

950
00:57:22.510 --> 00:57:26.350
you want to hear about it.
You hear about,
cause now when it goes off,

951
00:57:26.410 --> 00:57:29.830
it's a startle or cause it doesn't go off.
I mean most of the,
you know,

952
00:57:29.831 --> 00:57:33.820
50% of the time I'm up before the alarms,
but,
but if you leave that one on there,

953
00:57:33.821 --> 00:57:35.270
it's a star Adler and then,
then you,

954
00:57:35.320 --> 00:57:40.300
your spouse's waking up in a panic mode because now they don't know where it is.

955
00:57:40.640 --> 00:57:45.340
Then there's effort,
they're being attacked.
It's,
it's,
it's a gnarly situation.

956
00:57:45.730 --> 00:57:50.730
So shut off the secondary and tertiary alarms and then get out of the room and

957
00:57:51.701 --> 00:57:52.240
then,
you know,

958
00:57:52.240 --> 00:57:55.780
maybe even have your toothbrush and your toothpaste staged and another in the

959
00:57:55.970 --> 00:57:58.910
other bathroom or in the kitchen or whatever.
Get your workout gears.

960
00:57:58.930 --> 00:58:03.520
Not in a drawer by the bed where you're pulling that open,
making that racket.
No,

961
00:58:03.521 --> 00:58:08.290
you'd just get up and you leave.
So then,
um,

962
00:58:08.320 --> 00:58:11.710
that's,
that's how you do it.
That's how I do it.
And again,

963
00:58:11.770 --> 00:58:16.770
I have an advantage because my wife is a pretty heavy sleeper.
Um,

964
00:58:17.200 --> 00:58:19.840
she gets mad though when I come home from a trip and late at night,

965
00:58:19.900 --> 00:58:23.260
I do some unpacking in the night.
That can be a little frustrating for her.

966
00:58:23.890 --> 00:58:27.070
But anyways,
that's what you do.
Now,

967
00:58:27.310 --> 00:58:32.200
the next piece of this question was for alertness throughout the day.

968
00:58:32.290 --> 00:58:34.150
What do you do to stay alert throughout the day?

969
00:58:35.020 --> 00:58:38.320
I think one of the things you gotta do is check your diet,

970
00:58:39.760 --> 00:58:43.450
check the Diet,
make sure,
in my opinion,

971
00:58:43.451 --> 00:58:48.451
make sure you're not ingesting a ton of carbohydrates because those are going to

972
00:58:49.901 --> 00:58:50.380
make you tired.

973
00:58:50.380 --> 00:58:54.520
They're going to make you excited or make you fired up for about 20 minutes.

974
00:58:54.521 --> 00:58:56.030
I don't know,
haven't had him in a long

975
00:58:56.110 --> 00:58:59.650
<v 2>prime for like 20 minutes before you eat them.
Like right when you actually,</v>

976
00:58:59.651 --> 00:59:03.800
that's really what they're for.
Yeah.
Instant energy.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well,

977
00:59:04.450 --> 00:59:07.090
and they put you to sleep.
So when when you,
when you eat it,

978
00:59:07.180 --> 00:59:12.180
it's basically a really basic sequence is I'm going to do some output.

979
00:59:14.290 --> 00:59:16.700
You know,
in the wild.
I'm going to go hunting and whatever,
you know,

980
00:59:16.701 --> 00:59:21.350
I'm going to gather whatever,
do some output that expended some energy.

981
00:59:21.410 --> 00:59:22.040
I'm going to need some

982
00:59:22.040 --> 00:59:25.790
<v 3>energy and I'm going to need some rest.
When you get the,
the,
the energy,</v>

983
00:59:26.240 --> 00:59:29.810
carbohydrates,
food in any way,
Serotonin,

984
00:59:30.410 --> 00:59:34.310
all these other chemicals that induce you to go rest,
that's the sequence.

985
00:59:34.340 --> 00:59:36.060
That's the process.
Don't forget about an insulin.

986
00:59:39.520 --> 00:59:42.260
The insulin is going to make you tired too.
So check your diet,

987
00:59:42.890 --> 00:59:47.660
check your diamond.
I just had a guy on Twitter.
Ah Man,
he,
he's,
he's like,

988
00:59:47.840 --> 00:59:50.000
hey man,
I'm tired during the day.
I'm dragging.
I was like,
well,

989
00:59:50.001 --> 00:59:52.370
we'll check your diet.
And he's like,
well,
I think it's okay.

990
00:59:52.400 --> 00:59:56.720
I'm drinking a lot of energy drinks.
No,

991
00:59:56.900 --> 01:00:01.310
not good.
The energy drinks are addictive.
They're tasty,

992
01:00:01.400 --> 01:00:02.390
they're addictive,

993
01:00:03.260 --> 01:00:06.740
and they're filled with sugar most of the time.

994
01:00:06.970 --> 01:00:10.190
So you're going to get a major sugar rush and then you're going to crash.

995
01:00:10.220 --> 01:00:15.110
So you gotta be careful that they also,
you don't want to be on,

996
01:00:15.111 --> 01:00:17.600
on the crazy amount of caffeine all day.

997
01:00:17.600 --> 01:00:21.470
And that's gonna mess up your system as well.
Does the same thing as the sugar,

998
01:00:21.500 --> 01:00:23.330
the caffeine rush and then the crash,

999
01:00:23.710 --> 01:00:28.600
that's the same thing more than sugar.
Yeah.

1000
01:00:28.670 --> 01:00:32.770
In,
in,
well,
I'll tell you right now,
people ask me all the time,

1001
01:00:32.810 --> 01:00:35.540
they're surprised that I work out without caffeine in the morning.

1002
01:00:36.170 --> 01:00:39.240
But I'm telling you,
give it a try.
Yeah.

1003
01:00:39.680 --> 01:00:43.910
Because it'll be harder.
Maybe it's harder for you to get out of bed.

1004
01:00:43.940 --> 01:00:46.280
Maybe it's harder for you to get ready.

1005
01:00:46.281 --> 01:00:51.080
Maybe it's harder for you to get into the gym with no caffeine and maybe it's

1006
01:00:51.081 --> 01:00:53.480
harder for you to start your workout with no caffeine.

1007
01:00:53.481 --> 01:00:55.040
But once you start the workout,

1008
01:00:56.840 --> 01:01:01.010
I don't think it's going to be that big of a deal.
Yeah.
And if it is good,

1009
01:01:01.430 --> 01:01:04.910
make your workout harder.
You know,
I don't think it's that big of a deal.

1010
01:01:05.060 --> 01:01:08.660
So don't become addicted to the caffeine and that's going to be cause that can

1011
01:01:08.661 --> 01:01:11.780
get problematic.
And then,
um,

1012
01:01:12.200 --> 01:01:16.340
power nap talked about this before.
If you need to,
you take a little power nap.

1013
01:01:16.550 --> 01:01:18.680
You take six to eight minutes,
you set your alarm clock,

1014
01:01:18.681 --> 01:01:22.760
you elevate your feet above your heart,
you lay down and you can black out.

1015
01:01:22.761 --> 01:01:25.040
If you're really tired,
you six to eight minutes of your field.

1016
01:01:25.041 --> 01:01:29.270
Like you feel like a rock star after one of those,
you know,
I agree.

1017
01:01:29.930 --> 01:01:33.620
And another thing you can do if you're tired during the day,
no big deal.

1018
01:01:35.120 --> 01:01:37.610
Just find a little corner somewhere.
Go Bang some pushups out.

1019
01:01:37.970 --> 01:01:41.960
Go Bang out 10 burpees.
Yeah,
yeah.
Get the blood flow.
Just get the blood flowing.

1020
01:01:42.320 --> 01:01:43.700
There's no way it's,
it's,

1021
01:01:43.701 --> 01:01:48.701
it's physiologically impossible to do burpees and,

1022
01:01:49.630 --> 01:01:52.970
and remain tire,
whatever.

1023
01:01:52.971 --> 01:01:56.600
Burpees you can tell you since you turned into a physiology major over here

1024
01:01:56.660 --> 01:02:00.740
tonight,
if you want to tell me what that does physiologically,
I don't know.

1025
01:02:00.770 --> 01:02:04.530
But I do know this.
If you knock out 10 burpees,
it's a small purse,
Paul,

1026
01:02:04.550 --> 01:02:07.760
small prescription.
You will not be tired for at least a half an hour.

1027
01:02:08.080 --> 01:02:12.020
You're not going to be 10 burpees and then feel tired.
He can't do it.

1028
01:02:12.290 --> 01:02:16.910
I can tell you why physiologically endorphins get released or their stuff

1029
01:02:17.240 --> 01:02:20.040
adrenaline,
like when you know you're going to do physical activity,
when

1030
01:02:20.040 --> 01:02:22.950
<v 0>you know it,
you have it.
I'm not seen a huge adrenaline rush.
Just a little bit.</v>

1031
01:02:22.951 --> 01:02:27.870
We'll get into China and Russia a little bit.
She's still going part of it.

1032
01:02:27.960 --> 01:02:32.370
So that's,
those are some tips I guess for alertness throughout the day,

1033
01:02:32.770 --> 01:02:35.900
uh,
that I use.
Yeah.
Okay,
cool.

1034
01:02:36.030 --> 01:02:38.790
And for getting out of bed early in the morning.
Hey and by the way,

1035
01:02:38.820 --> 01:02:41.460
go to bed earlier at night.
Yeah.
Go to bed earlier at night.

1036
01:02:41.490 --> 01:02:45.960
I go to bed usually around 11.
Um,
I don't recommend that.
I don't run.

1037
01:02:46.050 --> 01:02:48.810
Recommend going to bed at 11 and getting up at four 30.
No,

1038
01:02:48.840 --> 01:02:51.570
I don't recommend that.
I recommend going to bed when you get tired.

1039
01:02:51.840 --> 01:02:53.070
Shut your computer off.

1040
01:02:53.120 --> 01:02:57.750
Stop looking at the interwebs and go to sleep.
You know what?

1041
01:02:57.751 --> 01:03:01.830
Go read an actual book cause that made you tired.
Yeah,
that will make you tie.

1042
01:03:01.840 --> 01:03:06.120
That's like the opposite of burpees.
Go read,
go read a book,

1043
01:03:06.510 --> 01:03:10.780
you know,
and just sit there and you will get more tired.
Yeah.

1044
01:03:10.890 --> 01:03:15.000
Unless like a real exciting or interesting book.
Whoa.
We had some more,
of course,

1045
01:03:15.060 --> 01:03:20.060
of course you don't read blood meridian before you go to bed and you're,

1046
01:03:20.340 --> 01:03:24.600
cause you're a fast sleeper.
Fast sleeper.
Well you don't need that much sleep,

1047
01:03:24.630 --> 01:03:29.100
but yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
The no sleep thing that'll get you so quick.

1048
01:03:29.130 --> 01:03:33.520
It'll promptly put you into your crash the next day.
Yeah.
I don't know.

1049
01:03:33.660 --> 01:03:37.380
You can power through.
Well,
I dunno.
I,
if I can go the next man.

1050
01:03:37.381 --> 01:03:40.500
I've even when you had the latest little baby,

1051
01:03:40.740 --> 01:03:44.460
you came in here on a couple hours sleep rolled in here ready to record.

1052
01:03:44.461 --> 01:03:47.820
You sat here,
you got after it.
Yeah.
It's true.
And there's all these different,

1053
01:03:48.020 --> 01:03:49.550
doesn't that make you realize?
Yeah.

1054
01:03:50.460 --> 01:03:52.590
It makes you realize how much more you can do.
I think a lot of people,

1055
01:03:53.020 --> 01:03:56.040
it's like this,
and I don't want to go into this full subject right now,

1056
01:03:56.130 --> 01:03:59.190
but the other day I did a 72 hour fast,

1057
01:03:59.820 --> 01:04:03.180
no food for 72 hours.
And there's a bunch of reasons we can talk about it.

1058
01:04:03.240 --> 01:04:05.550
Maybe we'll do it on a later podcast.
I will say this though.

1059
01:04:05.640 --> 01:04:06.810
What one small thing.

1060
01:04:08.340 --> 01:04:13.340
If you go 72 hours without eating it recalibrates your hunger meter because we

1061
01:04:17.191 --> 01:04:21.990
just think,
oh,
I haven't had a donut in two hours.
I'm starving.

1062
01:04:22.360 --> 01:04:25.980
No,
you're not starving.
You're not even hungry.
Not even close to Hungary.

1063
01:04:26.460 --> 01:04:30.840
So recalibrate that thing.
Do a fast.
Even if you just don't eat for 24 hours,

1064
01:04:30.900 --> 01:04:34.890
you realize that most of your hunger signals that are coming to your brain are

1065
01:04:34.891 --> 01:04:39.060
lies.
And I'm not saying they're lies like,
oh,
don't eat.

1066
01:04:39.390 --> 01:04:43.560
But I'm saying you don't need to eat.
And how liberating is it that I was,

1067
01:04:43.561 --> 01:04:46.560
I was having so much fun.
I was a,
I was on this fast and I'm just like,

1068
01:04:46.590 --> 01:04:50.070
don't even need food.
I don't eat food.
I don't need to eat that.

1069
01:04:50.280 --> 01:04:52.080
That's the ultimate control,
right?

1070
01:04:52.230 --> 01:04:55.800
What I don't need food fruit is the fruit for fruit is if you're weak,

1071
01:04:56.100 --> 01:04:59.490
you know what I mean?
It's that type of,
you get that mentality going in.

1072
01:04:59.491 --> 01:05:03.750
Then guess what?
Now you go on a travel day and you go,
Oh man,

1073
01:05:03.900 --> 01:05:06.300
I'm going to be in the airport all day today and I don't know what I'm going to

1074
01:05:06.301 --> 01:05:09.440
eat.
Don't eat anything.
Yup,
you're capable.
You're too low to keep.

1075
01:05:09.480 --> 01:05:12.780
You can go 72 hours.
As a matter of fact,
you can go 30 days without food.

1076
01:05:12.990 --> 01:05:17.260
So going three days is not that big of a deal.
It's not even that big of a deal.

1077
01:05:17.560 --> 01:05:20.380
I did when I just did this 72 hour fast.

1078
01:05:21.370 --> 01:05:25.450
He was just not like I did everything normal.
I went to Jujitsu,
I did worked out,

1079
01:05:25.451 --> 01:05:29.320
I did squats and pull ups.
Everything was normal,
everything was normal.

1080
01:05:29.321 --> 01:05:31.360
It's not that big crazy deal.

1081
01:05:31.900 --> 01:05:35.950
Just we just get so accustomed to to just feed in the machine all the time and

1082
01:05:35.951 --> 01:05:36.731
you could have a,
you know,

1083
01:05:36.731 --> 01:05:40.370
you got to have a meal every six hours and it's so at our fingertips.
It's so,

1084
01:05:40.900 --> 01:05:42.670
but it's also,
this is what I realized.

1085
01:05:42.671 --> 01:05:46.870
It's so inconvenient to have to eat all the time.
Oh Man.
You know flack.

1086
01:05:46.871 --> 01:05:49.210
You're right.
So it's kind of Nice to just eating.

1087
01:05:49.270 --> 01:05:54.070
I know once a day guys have put a big old steak on and get after it.
And yeah,

1088
01:05:54.071 --> 01:05:56.710
I mean,
and again I hate,
there's all kinds of people.

1089
01:05:56.830 --> 01:05:58.770
There's people that know this is it.

1090
01:05:58.810 --> 01:06:03.350
This is one of the reasons I don't like talking about this particular topic,
um,

1091
01:06:03.550 --> 01:06:04.221
is cause there's,

1092
01:06:04.221 --> 01:06:07.240
there's a lot of people that like study this and know a bunch about this Nepalis

1093
01:06:07.270 --> 01:06:12.130
facts.
So if I go and do the research,
well I know the facts too,

1094
01:06:12.131 --> 01:06:14.740
but I don't,
I can't not considering quote them.
Right.

1095
01:06:14.800 --> 01:06:19.800
I don't have the in depth knowledge that Peter a Tiaa has on fasting.

1096
01:06:21.280 --> 01:06:26.200
You know what I mean?
Or Dom D'agostino,
those guys,
their Ph,
they're doctors.

1097
01:06:26.260 --> 01:06:31.120
I'm not a doctor.
I'm a knucklehead.
That was,
and another thing is people,

1098
01:06:31.430 --> 01:06:34.780
you know.
What did you do to prepare for your fastest cause like I didn't eat.

1099
01:06:35.780 --> 01:06:36.400
Yeah,
I was,

1100
01:06:36.400 --> 01:06:41.400
I was with life and we were on a trip and we had like a lunch and then we did a

1101
01:06:41.561 --> 01:06:44.230
Gig that night and I don't like to eat before I do a gig.

1102
01:06:44.230 --> 01:06:48.460
And then after that we stayed up a little bit and did some work and then woke up

1103
01:06:48.461 --> 01:06:50.950
in the morning,
had an early flight,
and then I came home and I wanted to train.

1104
01:06:50.951 --> 01:06:53.320
So I worked out and I got done with that and I went and did something else.

1105
01:06:53.370 --> 01:06:55.450
And next thing I knew was 24 hours like,
Oh,
you know what?

1106
01:06:55.480 --> 01:06:57.880
The next day I didn't feel too hungry.
So I was like,
no,
and then just hold on.

1107
01:06:57.881 --> 01:07:01.540
So it wasn't no preparation,
just got after it.
Again,

1108
01:07:01.541 --> 01:07:03.220
people don't do,

1109
01:07:03.221 --> 01:07:08.020
this is anecdotal check with a physician or whatever he got to do.

1110
01:07:08.021 --> 01:07:08.854
Don't listen to me.

1111
01:07:09.090 --> 01:07:09.421
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

1112
01:07:09.421 --> 01:07:13.800
As far as like a recommendation you should do because you know you are different

1113
01:07:13.920 --> 01:07:16.770
and 17 hour fast.
Hey Dee,
I dig it man.

1114
01:07:16.771 --> 01:07:21.090
But I think really kind of the point that you're making or one of them anyway I

1115
01:07:21.091 --> 01:07:24.030
think is absolutely true.
So you're,
you know,

1116
01:07:24.031 --> 01:07:28.590
a lot of it is like habitual hunger,
but it goes beyond just like psychological,

1117
01:07:28.591 --> 01:07:30.870
habitual.
It's like physiological.
It's like,
okay,

1118
01:07:30.871 --> 01:07:32.670
I'm used to getting food every four hours.

1119
01:07:32.671 --> 01:07:35.480
So when the four hour mark comes around physiologically,
your,

1120
01:07:35.481 --> 01:07:37.860
your stomach going to be like,
where's my food?
Yeah.
Your mom's and move where?

1121
01:07:37.861 --> 01:07:41.490
My food.
And then after a while,
if you're like,
hey,
you don't get food this time,

1122
01:07:41.491 --> 01:07:43.370
your songs going,
okay,
sometimes we don't get food.
Yeah.

1123
01:07:43.380 --> 01:07:46.650
So let's kind of act right.
You know,
and then when the food comes,
okay,

1124
01:07:46.651 --> 01:07:47.260
we'll do that.

1125
01:07:47.260 --> 01:07:49.000
<v 0>When that happened,
the calibration is real though,</v>

1126
01:07:49.001 --> 01:07:53.070
because then after I started eating again and then the next day I go,
oh,
I'm,

1127
01:07:53.071 --> 01:07:55.570
I'm feeling hungry.
I'm gonna eat something.
I'm actually not hungry.

1128
01:07:55.630 --> 01:07:59.380
So why am I eating?
Why am I eating if I'm not hungry?
Yeah.

1129
01:07:59.460 --> 01:08:01.270
That's paints in my mind is controlling me,

1130
01:08:01.650 --> 01:08:05.950
<v 2>controlling my mind.
Yeah.
You know,
so,
and that's another thing where,
um,
you're,</v>

1131
01:08:05.960 --> 01:08:09.210
you're,
there's nothing new,
right?
Your mind is so strong or whatever.

1132
01:08:09.211 --> 01:08:11.700
So you can trick yourself into schools for sleep too.

1133
01:08:11.910 --> 01:08:16.040
So if you think that you got nine hours sleep,
you'll be

1134
01:08:16.040 --> 01:08:19.430
<v 3>way less tired then.
Okay.
Let's say two people,
exact people,</v>

1135
01:08:19.440 --> 01:08:22.280
they're identical twins,
identical life experience,
whatever.

1136
01:08:22.700 --> 01:08:26.240
One guy believes the next morning they both got eight hours sleep.

1137
01:08:26.270 --> 01:08:30.110
One guy believes he only got four hours sleep and one guy believes he got 10

1138
01:08:30.111 --> 01:08:32.490
hours sleep scenario.
Yeah,

1139
01:08:32.700 --> 01:08:36.280
but that's how your mind it knows like basically it's your mind accommodating

1140
01:08:36.350 --> 01:08:40.010
what it thinks the stimulus is.
So,
so the other twin,

1141
01:08:40.011 --> 01:08:41.660
the four hour sleep believer,

1142
01:08:41.960 --> 01:08:44.820
he's going to be way more tired and he's going be like,
Dang,
where that Napa,

1143
01:08:44.821 --> 01:08:46.280
I was looking for it.
I need or whatever.

1144
01:08:46.700 --> 01:08:48.290
Imagine if you woke up every day and you were like,

1145
01:08:48.291 --> 01:08:51.110
I only got four hours of sleep and I'm going to crush to exactly right.

1146
01:08:51.680 --> 01:08:56.330
I actually believe I work better on less sleep.
How you like them apples.

1147
01:08:56.360 --> 01:08:57.400
Exactly,
exactly.

1148
01:08:57.410 --> 01:09:01.190
And that's what was going to be my point there where you're like I told you,

1149
01:09:01.430 --> 01:09:03.470
I've told you that before.
Yeah.
I've,
I've,

1150
01:09:04.280 --> 01:09:09.280
I've told Echo before that when we're getting ready to record the podcast,

1151
01:09:09.770 --> 01:09:12.650
the day before I record the podcast,
that night,

1152
01:09:13.250 --> 01:09:18.250
I like to sleep less like four hours because I feel like it sharpens,

1153
01:09:20.600 --> 01:09:23.780
I'll tell you what,
to be quite honest,
when I,
what I think it does,
it,

1154
01:09:23.950 --> 01:09:26.000
it brings it,

1155
01:09:29.250 --> 01:09:33.360
it brings my emotions a little closer to the surface.

1156
01:09:34.130 --> 01:09:38.450
So like you feel like we're co I'm kind of under attack,
so I better wait.

1157
01:09:39.150 --> 01:09:43.410
I better like,
pardon up right now.
I better like get my two numbers from that.

1158
01:09:43.411 --> 01:09:47.490
It's like,
no,
this is what it is.
I can get more.
Like when I'm reading something,

1159
01:09:48.150 --> 01:09:52.890
I'm more focused on it.
I'm more into it,
like actively.
Yeah.

1160
01:09:52.891 --> 01:09:56.850
Because I think when I'm well rested,
I'm like,
uh,
like,
uh,
like rock solid,
right?

1161
01:09:56.880 --> 01:10:01.380
I'm just like,
Oh yeah,
we're not,
when I'm a little,
when I sleep less,

1162
01:10:01.650 --> 01:10:06.600
I'm a little bit more exposed.
I'm a little bit more vulnerable.
Right.
Mentally.

1163
01:10:07.830 --> 01:10:11.430
And I need that because otherwise I just become very,

1164
01:10:11.890 --> 01:10:13.510
<v 4>mmm mmm.</v>

1165
01:10:14.500 --> 01:10:18.820
<v 3>Detached or become very detached and it's,
it's,
I know.</v>

1166
01:10:18.821 --> 01:10:21.100
So I want it when I come in here,
I want to be on though.

1167
01:10:21.101 --> 01:10:23.310
I want to be on the fringe a little bit.
Right.
You know what I mean?

1168
01:10:23.320 --> 01:10:26.200
That's what I want to be exposed.
I want to be walking in here and be like,
man,

1169
01:10:26.201 --> 01:10:30.730
this is going to be,
this is an intense,
this a not a walk in the park today.

1170
01:10:31.090 --> 01:10:33.010
This is going to be hard.
So yes,

1171
01:10:33.011 --> 01:10:35.410
I want to be stressed a little bit when I come in here.

1172
01:10:36.460 --> 01:10:38.710
I couldn't dig it and I feel,
I always feel that way.
Like,

1173
01:10:38.770 --> 01:10:39.950
like it's the same thing in Jujitsu.

1174
01:10:39.970 --> 01:10:44.860
I feel better when I'm stressed and when I'm a little bit more,
yeah,

1175
01:10:44.861 --> 01:10:46.480
a little bit more stressed,
a little bit more tension,

1176
01:10:46.481 --> 01:10:49.450
a little bit more pressure on myself.
I want to be there.

1177
01:10:49.980 --> 01:10:51.610
They don't want to be there all the time.
And I'll tell you what,

1178
01:10:51.640 --> 01:10:54.280
just so everybody knows,
there's some days where I'm tired,

1179
01:10:55.160 --> 01:10:59.320
where I'm just tired and I just,
sometimes I just need a power nap so bad.

1180
01:10:59.321 --> 01:11:02.380
I'm a call him and I'm literally falling asleep,
you know?
And I hate that.

1181
01:11:02.620 --> 01:11:05.380
That's a horrible feeling,
but you know what?
Elevate your feet.

1182
01:11:05.770 --> 01:11:08.380
Set her alarm clock for eight minutes,
boom,
you're going to wake up.

1183
01:11:08.381 --> 01:11:09.420
Feel like Superman.

1184
01:11:12.490 --> 01:11:14.340
It's Kinda like when people hit themselves

1185
01:11:14.340 --> 01:11:18.240
<v 2>before they go lift because it weighed,
you mean they're like slap them.
So No.</v>

1186
01:11:18.241 --> 01:11:21.510
Yeah,
for sure.
On the surface it looks like,
oh,
he's getting fired up,
but yeah.

1187
01:11:21.511 --> 01:11:24.300
Why is he getting fired up for the exact same reason that you're talking about?

1188
01:11:24.301 --> 01:11:25.960
Because if it's like,
oh mom,

1189
01:11:26.700 --> 01:11:29.490
I'm getting these things where I got to kind of bounce back from,
right.

1190
01:11:29.491 --> 01:11:33.650
I'm under attack.
Adrenaline rush too.
Right,
so physiologic.

1191
01:11:33.651 --> 01:11:35.190
It's the same exact sequence right there,

1192
01:11:35.760 --> 01:11:39.840
but you're just doing it consciously and instead of slaps it's lack of sleep.

1193
01:11:40.100 --> 01:11:43.590
Yes.
Or what have you.

1194
01:11:45.530 --> 01:11:47.070
There would go,
that's

1195
01:11:49.850 --> 01:11:54.720
the answer in everyone's going to attack me on social media for not sleeping,

1196
01:11:54.780 --> 01:11:59.590
not eating and all that.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1197
01:11:59.850 --> 01:12:03.900
Well
it.
Hey chocolate.

1198
01:12:03.990 --> 01:12:06.780
I appreciate your advice.
I know I should.
I do know I should sleep more.

1199
01:12:06.810 --> 01:12:10.890
I do know I should eat,
you know better.
I'm sorry,
but what does that even mean?

1200
01:12:11.700 --> 01:12:15.540
Should the word should,
what does that even mean?
You should,
it's,
yeah.
Anyway,

1201
01:12:15.541 --> 01:12:19.380
that's the whole night.
A chocolate don't be you anymore.
Well that's true.

1202
01:12:19.550 --> 01:12:24.040
Be Different than you.
That's what that,
well,
I actually actually the point out,

1203
01:12:25.200 --> 01:12:28.280
what I was going to say earlier is just like what you're saying,

1204
01:12:28.300 --> 01:12:32.430
the like you're not citing all this science and making claims about like how

1205
01:12:32.431 --> 01:12:34.680
this is going to benefit you or nothing like that.
That's not what you're doing.

1206
01:12:34.681 --> 01:12:39.240
It's,
it is anecdotal and I think the point is that if you push yourself through

1207
01:12:39.241 --> 01:12:43.020
certain situations and you prove it to yourself that you can function just fine

1208
01:12:43.320 --> 01:12:47.160
with,
I don't know,
five hours sleep rather than eight one or two times or,

1209
01:12:47.161 --> 01:12:50.370
or whatever,
or however many you know that you can do that.
Like,
you know,

1210
01:12:50.371 --> 01:12:54.090
we'd talked about this before where you get kind of dependent,

1211
01:12:54.100 --> 01:12:58.050
uncertain things and then to the point where you believe that you can't function

1212
01:12:58.051 --> 01:13:02.650
without it.
Whether it be sleep,
whether it be coffee in the morning,
w w you know,

1213
01:13:02.670 --> 01:13:04.590
whatever or are eating every four hours.

1214
01:13:04.591 --> 01:13:08.580
Like when I was really into like weightlifting and bodybuilding type stuff,

1215
01:13:08.670 --> 01:13:11.580
I remember thinking,
man,
I gotta,
I gotta hurry up and eat.

1216
01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:15.720
It's four hours or whatever.
And then kind of later on in life and I've got like,

1217
01:13:15.721 --> 01:13:19.740
I haven't eaten yet today and it's late in the day.
I'm fine,

1218
01:13:20.280 --> 01:13:25.110
you're not,
I'm not losing my,
yeah,
whatever games.
But Games,
game,

1219
01:13:25.111 --> 01:13:27.000
whatever.
So once you prove it to yourself,

1220
01:13:27.001 --> 01:13:30.960
it's like if you stay up all night when you have work the next day and you do

1221
01:13:30.961 --> 01:13:34.260
your work when you go to bed,
you can be like,
hey,
if I had to,

1222
01:13:34.590 --> 01:13:35.640
I could do that again.

1223
01:13:35.700 --> 01:13:40.680
That is another thing that I enjoy about pushing those envelopes is it feels

1224
01:13:40.681 --> 01:13:42.330
really good to go to bed when you've been awake for a long time.

1225
01:13:42.570 --> 01:13:45.480
It feels really good to eat a meal once you haven't eaten for him for awhile.

1226
01:13:45.510 --> 01:13:49.320
You appreciate it more.
Yeah,
that's good.
That's true.

1227
01:13:49.321 --> 01:13:54.090
But that's kind of a psycho wave of invoking appreciation.

1228
01:13:55.240 --> 01:13:59.970
My opinion.
Understood.
Mixed question.
Oh,

1229
01:13:59.971 --> 01:14:02.730
back to the Iron Swan.
That's it.
That's the song.

1230
01:14:03.180 --> 01:14:08.130
Just a reminder to give it a try.
The sword,
this sword.
Next question.

1231
01:14:09.360 --> 01:14:12.400
What's the best way to handle awful random

1232
01:14:12.490 --> 01:14:17.490
<v 0>people say bunch of intimidating thugs on a bus or a violence,</v>

1233
01:14:17.731 --> 01:14:18.880
scary drunk person.

1234
01:14:22.540 --> 01:14:22.940
Well,

1235
01:14:22.940 --> 01:14:26.740
when there's even more awful random people out there that you might need to look

1236
01:14:26.741 --> 01:14:28.330
out for,
I think this is,
uh,
you know,

1237
01:14:28.420 --> 01:14:32.070
obviously you've got people that are pointed criminals that are coming after
you.

1238
01:14:32.071 --> 01:14:35.830
You got terrorist that might be coming after you or just trying to do random

1239
01:14:35.831 --> 01:14:40.150
acts of mass violence.
So those are,
those are particular type.

1240
01:14:40.151 --> 01:14:44.200
I think that this is a question directed for more of,

1241
01:14:44.260 --> 01:14:47.320
of something that could easily happen to people.

1242
01:14:47.650 --> 01:14:52.650
Random people that are being jerks or thugs or people that are drunk or high or

1243
01:14:55.391 --> 01:14:59.560
wouldn't have brought.
Okay.
So obviously what do we want to do?

1244
01:14:59.640 --> 01:15:03.700
We want to be prepared.
So to start with,

1245
01:15:03.730 --> 01:15:05.680
you want to be in really good physical condition.
So,
I mean,

1246
01:15:05.681 --> 01:15:10.530
do you want to work out?
You want to be ready to handle yourself physically.
Um,

1247
01:15:11.020 --> 01:15:12.070
you want to know how to fight.

1248
01:15:12.700 --> 01:15:17.380
That means you need to train Jujitsu,
boxing,
Moy,
Thai wrestling,

1249
01:15:17.710 --> 01:15:20.620
you.
If you're in a high crime area,

1250
01:15:20.621 --> 01:15:24.760
you're in a high threat area and you think this stuff is really going to happen

1251
01:15:24.850 --> 01:15:29.050
out there,
then guess what?
You need to get a firearm.

1252
01:15:29.080 --> 01:15:32.620
You need to learn how to shoot a firearm.
You need to train with the firearm.

1253
01:15:32.621 --> 01:15:37.180
You need to understand the ramifications of utilizing a firearm and then you

1254
01:15:37.181 --> 01:15:40.210
need to carry it so you can protect yourself.
And those same things go.

1255
01:15:40.240 --> 01:15:43.030
If you decide you're going to carry any kind of weapon,

1256
01:15:43.780 --> 01:15:48.780
whether it's pepper spray or a mace or an ASP or a knife,

1257
01:15:52.211 --> 01:15:55.780
anything that you're going to carry,
you better know what you're doing.

1258
01:15:55.960 --> 01:15:57.190
You need to prepare with it.

1259
01:15:57.940 --> 01:16:02.650
So that's what you need to do to be prepared.
Okay?
That's,

1260
01:16:03.050 --> 01:16:05.950
that's what in,
and you know I've said this before,

1261
01:16:06.070 --> 01:16:10.060
I said it on the Sam Harris' podcast.
If you,
you,
if you do these things,

1262
01:16:10.120 --> 01:16:12.340
if you work on your physical condition,
if you work on your fighting,

1263
01:16:12.341 --> 01:16:14.080
if you work on your shooting,
if you work on your,

1264
01:16:14.470 --> 01:16:18.910
your weapon skills and you never have to use them,
great.

1265
01:16:20.110 --> 01:16:22.960
I will still say it is not been wasted time.

1266
01:16:23.140 --> 01:16:25.840
It has been time that has made you a better person.

1267
01:16:25.841 --> 01:16:29.260
It's imposed discipline on you.
It's got you better physical conditioning.

1268
01:16:29.261 --> 01:16:33.310
It's just good for you.
So regardless,

1269
01:16:33.370 --> 01:16:35.950
you should be training in these types of situations.
Now,

1270
01:16:36.580 --> 01:16:40.120
once you get to this type of situation,
first of all,
how did you get there?

1271
01:16:40.360 --> 01:16:43.060
Because we need to have situational awareness,
right?
You,

1272
01:16:43.061 --> 01:16:46.630
how are you not paying attention to what's going on around you?

1273
01:16:46.631 --> 01:16:48.850
You need to pay attention to what's going on around you.

1274
01:16:49.720 --> 01:16:54.100
And then you watch for these scenarios that could unfold and you avoid them,

1275
01:16:54.220 --> 01:16:55.720
period.
So,

1276
01:16:55.721 --> 01:17:00.430
so how are you getting stuck on a bus with a bunch of maniacs,
right?
And he,

1277
01:17:00.431 --> 01:17:04.180
there's something when they got on,
you got off.
That's a real simple,
right?

1278
01:17:04.270 --> 01:17:07.570
Or you go to get on and you see these knuckleheads.
You Walk Right back off.

1279
01:17:07.690 --> 01:17:10.430
I mean that's,
that's pretty easy and all.

1280
01:17:10.431 --> 01:17:12.790
There's a bunch of knuckleheads walking down the street towards you.
Cool.

1281
01:17:12.791 --> 01:17:15.530
Cross the street,
walk down the other side.
Situational awareness.

1282
01:17:15.560 --> 01:17:20.090
Oh you hear him coming up behind you.
Cool.
Step off across the street.
Avoid.

1283
01:17:20.330 --> 01:17:22.220
We want to be have situational awareness.

1284
01:17:23.120 --> 01:17:28.120
That's going to solve that should solve 99% of your problems is being aware of

1285
01:17:31.401 --> 01:17:35.210
your surroundings,
understanding your situation,
planning.

1286
01:17:35.240 --> 01:17:38.030
What about just simple planning,
like where you going?

1287
01:17:38.031 --> 01:17:40.160
When are you going to come home?
You know,

1288
01:17:40.161 --> 01:17:42.720
if you took a subway into the city at night and you know you're going to work,

1289
01:17:42.730 --> 01:17:47.730
coming home late at night and you're alone and you are suspect of what's

1290
01:17:47.871 --> 01:17:51.080
happening,
maybe you get an Uber instead of riding the subway.

1291
01:17:51.170 --> 01:17:56.060
It's just planning that comes into play as well to avoid these situations.

1292
01:17:57.410 --> 01:18:02.410
Now if you do get caught in these situations,

1293
01:18:03.620 --> 01:18:07.130
here's a couple recommendations.

1294
01:18:08.450 --> 01:18:09.283
Okay.

1295
01:18:09.590 --> 01:18:14.510
My number one is to kind of do your best to detach from,

1296
01:18:15.590 --> 01:18:17.900
from the scenario,
right?
So you got,

1297
01:18:17.901 --> 01:18:21.920
let's say you're on a bus and there's a bunch of people acting crazy and they

1298
01:18:21.921 --> 01:18:24.560
jumped on right after you got on and you couldn't get oftentimes,

1299
01:18:24.561 --> 01:18:27.050
so now you're on the bus with them.
I want you to detach from them,

1300
01:18:27.470 --> 01:18:30.740
so that means you're not looking at them,
you're not staring at them,

1301
01:18:30.741 --> 01:18:32.930
you're not being all intimidated.
You want to just attach,

1302
01:18:32.940 --> 01:18:36.380
just do what you would normally do in your,
everyone carries a phone these days.

1303
01:18:36.381 --> 01:18:39.540
Break out your phone,
start looking at your phone,
pull out your paper,

1304
01:18:39.550 --> 01:18:42.550
started looking at your paper study.
If you don't have either one of those two,

1305
01:18:42.551 --> 01:18:44.450
you know,
look outside,
look at the passing.

1306
01:18:44.630 --> 01:18:48.530
Just just don't enter their world.

1307
01:18:48.770 --> 01:18:52.160
Don't become a part of their thing that they have going on because what they

1308
01:18:52.161 --> 01:18:53.630
want you to do is they want you to make eye contact.

1309
01:18:53.780 --> 01:18:55.430
What they want you to do is glance over at them.

1310
01:18:55.431 --> 01:18:59.030
What they want you to do is enter their world because a lot of times these

1311
01:18:59.031 --> 01:19:03.710
knuckleheads that they're in their own world and you actually have to penetrate

1312
01:19:03.711 --> 01:19:06.680
their world.
If you want to get in there so what you want.

1313
01:19:06.740 --> 01:19:09.170
So what I'm gonna do is I'm just going to remain,
I'm not going to,

1314
01:19:09.260 --> 01:19:12.020
I'm not going to cower though.
There's a difference.
Okay.

1315
01:19:12.200 --> 01:19:14.900
Cause if you give the impression of,
you're just like cowering and scared,

1316
01:19:14.901 --> 01:19:17.320
well then there,
that's,
that's entering their world and they're going to,

1317
01:19:17.390 --> 01:19:20.720
they're going to recognize that.
But if you're just,
hey,
sitting here,

1318
01:19:20.721 --> 01:19:22.970
just doing what you'd normally do and it's not a big deal.

1319
01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:26.120
You do this all the time.
You don't care about them.
Don't care about me.

1320
01:19:26.121 --> 01:19:29.330
Leave me alone.
That's,
that's where I'm going.

1321
01:19:29.570 --> 01:19:33.590
Now if for whatever reason I make some kind of eye contact right now,

1322
01:19:33.591 --> 01:19:36.230
I made the eye contact of I've entered their world,

1323
01:19:36.290 --> 01:19:37.990
I'm going to go ahead and give him just a little head nod,
you know,

1324
01:19:38.030 --> 01:19:41.450
just a little,
just a little regular head nod like I would do with you.

1325
01:19:41.451 --> 01:19:43.130
And if I saw you on the street,
Hey,
you know,

1326
01:19:43.131 --> 01:19:46.430
just a little respectful little head nod and then I'm gonna go right back to

1327
01:19:46.431 --> 01:19:48.110
what I was doing and go right back out of their world.

1328
01:19:48.260 --> 01:19:50.750
I acknowledged their world.
I'm not going to give a bunch of,

1329
01:19:51.090 --> 01:19:54.200
I'm not going to look scared,
but I'm not gonna look aggressive.

1330
01:19:54.201 --> 01:19:57.050
I'm just going to be respectful.
That little head nod,
you know,

1331
01:19:57.170 --> 01:20:02.050
how for you having a good night,
that's good.
Um,
and then go,

1332
01:20:02.060 --> 01:20:05.360
go back to your business again.
I just want to detach from them.

1333
01:20:05.540 --> 01:20:07.710
That's my attitude.
It didn't want to detach from them.

1334
01:20:07.980 --> 01:20:10.620
And this avoids them saying,
you know,

1335
01:20:10.650 --> 01:20:12.840
like if they're looking at you and you don't look back or,

1336
01:20:12.841 --> 01:20:17.790
or they're just like bearing down on you,
Hey,
what do you know?
Why don't you,

1337
01:20:17.791 --> 01:20:20.580
why are you ignoring me,
your whatever you too cool for me,

1338
01:20:20.581 --> 01:20:23.220
or something like that.
So sometimes you get,
you'll look a little head nod.

1339
01:20:23.221 --> 01:20:28.110
It's all good.
Um,
if,
if now,

1340
01:20:28.111 --> 01:20:31.270
if they do start now,
see I'm escalating this.
So they're escalating it.

1341
01:20:31.270 --> 01:20:35.850
So now if they do start to escalate this thing in,
like,

1342
01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:40.590
like,
you know,
what are you looking at?
Or one of those things,
it's just,
again,

1343
01:20:40.591 --> 01:20:43.680
what you're trying to do is you're trying to deescalate without being appearing

1344
01:20:43.681 --> 01:20:48.390
vulnerable,
you know?
So maybe it was just,
you know,
hey,
no issue here.

1345
01:20:50.010 --> 01:20:54.870
You know,
just something simple like that.
No,
I'm good.
I'm like,

1346
01:20:54.871 --> 01:20:58.320
what are you doing?
Oh,
just riding the bus home.
You know what I mean?

1347
01:20:58.321 --> 01:21:01.350
Just real matter of fact.
Just didn't go try and get back,
but you know,

1348
01:21:02.060 --> 01:21:04.050
you might want to just even try and,
and,

1349
01:21:04.110 --> 01:21:06.910
and connect a little connection instead of,
I'm trying to go home,

1350
01:21:06.911 --> 01:21:10.290
cause that might piss some people off because they don't have a home or their

1351
01:21:10.291 --> 01:21:13.860
home is a bad place.
So what might be better than saying that?
As,
you know,

1352
01:21:13.890 --> 01:21:17.160
I just got done with work now you're just don't work in man.
Right.

1353
01:21:17.760 --> 01:21:18.920
Of course you might be dealing with someone.

1354
01:21:18.921 --> 01:21:21.000
It doesn't have a job and lost their jobs.
So what I'm saying,
you're,

1355
01:21:21.001 --> 01:21:24.090
you're not gonna come up with a grid,
but my point here is just,

1356
01:21:24.091 --> 01:21:29.091
you're just going to try and make simple nonconfrontational statements that

1357
01:21:30.421 --> 01:21:33.570
don't give them anything to grab onto.
Cause that's what they want.

1358
01:21:33.630 --> 01:21:38.430
They want something.
They,
they,
they just want something to grab onto,
you know,
uh,

1359
01:21:38.610 --> 01:21:41.220
that's what they're looking for.
So you don't want to let that happen.

1360
01:21:43.140 --> 01:21:47.250
Now things can still continue to escalate.
You know,

1361
01:21:47.251 --> 01:21:52.251
you get someone that's determined to be a jerk or determined to be hostile or

1362
01:21:53.541 --> 01:21:57.000
determined,
be aggressive.
Now I'll tell you that if you train,

1363
01:21:57.090 --> 01:22:01.830
then you work out and you do Jujitsu and you have skills.

1364
01:22:02.640 --> 01:22:05.490
People know it.
People,

1365
01:22:05.910 --> 01:22:10.230
people that are belligerence generally can tell.

1366
01:22:10.860 --> 01:22:12.360
Even in a drunken state,

1367
01:22:13.170 --> 01:22:16.560
when you square off with someone or you look at someone and they have an

1368
01:22:16.561 --> 01:22:19.260
attitude of like,
look,
I do this all the time.

1369
01:22:22.070 --> 01:22:25.680
I'm good.
You want to fight?
I'm here.
Not saying that,
but just a look.

1370
01:22:25.710 --> 01:22:30.450
And people can tell
if they're real troublemakers,
they can tell.
Now,

1371
01:22:30.451 --> 01:22:32.730
sometimes that's not a good thing because that means they're going to do the

1372
01:22:32.731 --> 01:22:36.180
challenge,
you know?
So you've gotta watch out for that.
So

1373
01:22:38.490 --> 01:22:42.270
<v 2>I think that that's right.
Even though on the Internet it might tell it,</v>

1374
01:22:42.510 --> 01:22:44.970
it might seem like it's telling a different story,
you know,
it's like,

1375
01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:47.810
Oh guy confronts the wrong guy.
You know,

1376
01:22:47.830 --> 01:22:51.210
Guy Street thug confronts Jujitsu master or something,

1377
01:22:51.211 --> 01:22:55.290
and then it shows that they actually fought.
So it kind of seems like,
oh no,

1378
01:22:55.291 --> 01:22:57.060
they don't know obviously out there.

1379
01:22:57.420 --> 01:23:00.810
But that's rare men and that's why it makes the Internet.
So it's rare.

1380
01:23:00.811 --> 01:23:04.370
Typically the,
yeah,
and this is no guarantee,
but I'm just saying,

1381
01:23:04.870 --> 01:23:06.070
I could tell even

1382
01:23:06.070 --> 01:23:07.720
<v 0>before I started doing Jujitsu.
Yup.</v>

1383
01:23:07.840 --> 01:23:09.430
I could tell if somebody who's ready to rumble,

1384
01:23:09.770 --> 01:23:12.260
<v 2>I have that ready to rumble,</v>

1385
01:23:12.290 --> 01:23:16.850
no fight training to a guy who was belligerent to me directly.
Right.

1386
01:23:17.480 --> 01:23:21.290
Terry was there,
we were working and all I did was act like I knew,

1387
01:23:21.830 --> 01:23:25.190
I didn't know by the way,
act like a new and in front of everybody.
I was like,

1388
01:23:25.490 --> 01:23:29.870
Oh hey,
I'm sorry man.
It's my bed,
a little bit bigger than me too.

1389
01:23:29.871 --> 01:23:31.930
And he just said,
but I was ready to,

1390
01:23:32.750 --> 01:23:35.030
I was ready to do the best fighting I could cause it was,

1391
01:23:35.060 --> 01:23:37.370
it was kind of go time at that point he was like,

1392
01:23:37.550 --> 01:23:39.500
you know the kind of guy where he's talking and he's like,
yeah man,

1393
01:23:39.501 --> 01:23:42.620
I'm from Chicago and he's like rubbing against me in my face.

1394
01:23:43.130 --> 01:23:46.980
Not like I want to fight you,
but just like,
like almost like a dog would,

1395
01:23:46.981 --> 01:23:51.200
you know,
just and rubbing against me and then whatever,
you know,
I,

1396
01:23:51.290 --> 01:23:53.360
I made like,
okay,
we're about to fight.

1397
01:23:53.380 --> 01:23:57.150
It took on my jacket real quick or whatever.
And um,
and it was like,
all right,

1398
01:23:57.450 --> 01:24:00.770
like this,
go.
Just like how you're saying though,
just real matter of fact,

1399
01:24:01.100 --> 01:24:03.170
you know,
you do this all the time.
Yup.

1400
01:24:03.530 --> 01:24:07.460
And the thing I understand that it is on right now,
understand.
And then the guy,

1401
01:24:07.520 --> 01:24:12.380
and he surprisingly,
it's not pricing.
Hey,
hey,
my bad,
my bad bro.
My Dad,

1402
01:24:12.410 --> 01:24:13.760
my bad in front of everybody though

1403
01:24:14.500 --> 01:24:19.500
<v 0>rising because people that act like that are are weak and they're insecure and</v>

1404
01:24:20.541 --> 01:24:21.321
they're acting on that.

1405
01:24:21.321 --> 01:24:25.510
And so when somebody stands up to him and they look at them and think there's

1406
01:24:25.520 --> 01:24:27.920
good monarchs actually know how to fight it,
then that's what happens.

1407
01:24:27.921 --> 01:24:30.320
And by the way,
when you do train all the time,

1408
01:24:30.480 --> 01:24:33.560
<v 2>you do know how to fly,
then it is matter of fact,
you're like,
yeah,
I'll,</v>

1409
01:24:33.570 --> 01:24:36.380
I'll fight you.
Yeah,
hold on.
This feeling,
feeling it's,

1410
01:24:36.410 --> 01:24:40.460
<v 0>it's,
it's a good feeling to know that you can handle yourself now.
Okay,</v>

1411
01:24:40.461 --> 01:24:45.220
so now this continues to escalate and you know,

1412
01:24:45.270 --> 01:24:46.760
you just try and keep your distance from people.

1413
01:24:46.880 --> 01:24:48.920
You don't want to let them get close.
You don't know they got a knife.

1414
01:24:48.921 --> 01:24:51.310
You don't know what kind of disease they are used to want to keep away from
them.

1415
01:24:52.310 --> 01:24:54.380
But eventually you might not be able to backup anymore.

1416
01:24:54.440 --> 01:24:58.280
You might not be able to keep any distance.
Um,
watch their hands,

1417
01:24:58.340 --> 01:24:59.720
keep as much distance as you can't.

1418
01:24:59.721 --> 01:25:03.140
Eventually you got to put your hands up and kind of a nonconfrontational way to

1419
01:25:03.141 --> 01:25:07.910
protect your face to protect those soccer punch.
That's common.
Um,
you know,

1420
01:25:07.911 --> 01:25:10.550
you put your hands up just in a non confrontational way,
up,

1421
01:25:10.560 --> 01:25:15.200
up around your head and continue to deescalate.
Hey Man,
I'm out here.
Don't,

1422
01:25:15.201 --> 01:25:18.320
don't want any problems.
You know,
I'm not looking for an issue.

1423
01:25:18.920 --> 01:25:21.200
I don't know what your issue is,
but I don't have any issue with you.

1424
01:25:21.290 --> 01:25:26.000
I'm just trying to head home from work.
You know,
one of those things.
And finally,

1425
01:25:26.390 --> 01:25:29.510
if you get to a point where you have no choice,

1426
01:25:29.690 --> 01:25:34.040
well then you utilize the skills that you have.
You hit hard,

1427
01:25:34.041 --> 01:25:38.480
hit fast and don't stop hiding until the threat is neutralized and then you get

1428
01:25:38.481 --> 01:25:42.620
away.
And that's in order to be able to do that,

1429
01:25:43.430 --> 01:25:48.270
you know,
go to step one,
prepare,
prepare your,
uh,

1430
01:25:49.310 --> 01:25:53.330
the 99% of situations will be avoided if you're just aware,

1431
01:25:53.360 --> 01:25:57.770
most important thing,
the most important thing,
that's a huge deal.

1432
01:25:57.830 --> 01:25:58.663
So true.

1433
01:25:58.940 --> 01:26:02.510
We would much rather have you do that because any of these situations I could go

1434
01:26:02.511 --> 01:26:04.220
out,
I'm pretty prepared for anything.

1435
01:26:04.610 --> 01:26:09.610
I could go out tonight and have some guys square off with me and as I'm getting

1436
01:26:10.371 --> 01:26:12.800
ready to fight him,
his buddy cracks me in the head with a,

1437
01:26:12.920 --> 01:26:16.580
with a bottle and kills me.
That could happen tonight.
You know,

1438
01:26:16.581 --> 01:26:19.010
that could happen at a restaurant tonight.
That could happen.

1439
01:26:19.610 --> 01:26:22.490
So what am I going to try and do?
I'm sure to try to avoid it.

1440
01:26:22.520 --> 01:26:25.520
The minute you square off with somebody,
you're now,

1441
01:26:25.580 --> 01:26:28.880
you're now a target for all his friends.
By the way,

1442
01:26:29.300 --> 01:26:34.300
I've been in some bar fights where the idiot that is being belligerent doesn't

1443
01:26:36.321 --> 01:26:40.850
have the common sense or it doesn't have the sense that he's surrounded by,

1444
01:26:40.910 --> 01:26:45.020
you know,
by my friends and you're just thinking you don't even,
you're doomed.

1445
01:26:45.590 --> 01:26:50.590
So luckily the guys that I hang out with a pretty honorable people that aren't

1446
01:26:51.291 --> 01:26:55.190
just gonna,
you know,
crush somebody's skull,
but you don't always get,

1447
01:26:55.191 --> 01:26:57.740
that's no guarantee.
That's no guarantee.

1448
01:26:57.741 --> 01:27:02.330
There's murders every day in America and they're not planned.
All of them.

1449
01:27:02.360 --> 01:27:03.620
Seldom are they planned

1450
01:27:04.470 --> 01:27:07.450
<v 2>this guy on Facebook,
I want to say,</v>

1451
01:27:08.530 --> 01:27:11.920
I think I always get confused with the name because like a lot of people will be

1452
01:27:11.921 --> 01:27:15.700
like,
hey echoes and ask me questions in regards to this podcast.

1453
01:27:15.701 --> 01:27:20.590
So I was one of the other podcast,
this podcast,
I don't want to be like,

1454
01:27:20.680 --> 01:27:22.060
okay,
he asked me,
but no,

1455
01:27:22.061 --> 01:27:27.061
it was a guy asked me like this scenario was,

1456
01:27:27.611 --> 01:27:29.810
he was at a,
at a bar or party or something and um,

1457
01:27:29.970 --> 01:27:34.060
and guys were being disrespectful to him and his wife or girlfriend or
something.

1458
01:27:34.450 --> 01:27:38.080
And then he's like,
I know the high road,
I know the right thing to do,

1459
01:27:38.081 --> 01:27:42.880
quote unquote is to,
to,
to be done with it,
you know,
to leave the situation.

1460
01:27:42.881 --> 01:27:45.070
But when you leave you feel like a little,
you know,

1461
01:27:45.100 --> 01:27:49.060
like you will stout and that's really powerful feeling that you don't want.

1462
01:27:49.660 --> 01:27:52.270
So like what do you do men?
How do you,
how do you reconcile it?

1463
01:27:52.271 --> 01:27:54.550
Or should I fight or under certain circumstance?

1464
01:27:54.551 --> 01:27:57.010
Should I just fight for the honor kind of thing?
Like what's the thing?

1465
01:27:57.760 --> 01:28:01.420
And so I've always really looked at it this way,

1466
01:28:01.450 --> 01:28:02.710
especially if you're kind of like,

1467
01:28:02.740 --> 01:28:06.010
if you have mental can kind of control over the situation where you can be like,

1468
01:28:06.011 --> 01:28:08.020
okay,
am I going to fight like fight this guy or what?

1469
01:28:08.140 --> 01:28:11.650
So when you choose to engage,
you want to fight the guy,
you're going to say,

1470
01:28:11.651 --> 01:28:12.100
you know what,

1471
01:28:12.100 --> 01:28:15.370
you said the wrong thing to me and I'm going to square off or to my wife or

1472
01:28:15.371 --> 01:28:19.010
whatever,
you know,
so I'm going to choose to square off.
Now all you do,

1473
01:28:19.210 --> 01:28:22.210
what you did use,
you took on all the potential results of that.

1474
01:28:22.240 --> 01:28:24.640
You took all that on.
Even if you win the fight,

1475
01:28:24.641 --> 01:28:29.641
you'd get arrested like everything as opposed to taking on all the potential

1476
01:28:30.101 --> 01:28:31.330
results.
Probable,

1477
01:28:31.340 --> 01:28:35.140
you know that come with not engaging,

1478
01:28:35.260 --> 01:28:39.850
which include going home safe,
your wife's safe,
everybody's safe.

1479
01:28:39.851 --> 01:28:42.040
Wake up tomorrow just like you would the other day.

1480
01:28:42.100 --> 01:28:46.840
And then compare that to jail.
I'm injured in some way.
Um,

1481
01:28:47.100 --> 01:28:51.550
I can't,
you know,
I can function less tomorrow if I didn't make it home tomorrow,

1482
01:28:51.700 --> 01:28:53.110
you know,
death,
all this stuff.

1483
01:28:53.830 --> 01:28:58.140
When you kind of consider the outcomes that you want and the reason you're going

1484
01:28:58.141 --> 01:29:01.180
to make one decision over the other.
It kinda,
it comes real clear.

1485
01:29:01.320 --> 01:29:02.190
Even though at the time

1486
01:29:02.190 --> 01:29:04.560
<v 3>it's so powerful because you're like,
oh man,</v>

1487
01:29:04.561 --> 01:29:07.050
I don't want to what's out in front of everybody or my wife,
you know,

1488
01:29:07.051 --> 01:29:09.930
is my honor in front of my wife.
Probably your wife wants you to leave.

1489
01:29:10.110 --> 01:29:13.310
Your wife doesn't want you to be like,
oh,
my husband got in a bar fight.
Woo.
Like,

1490
01:29:13.350 --> 01:29:17.970
I'm so proud of him.
You know,
know your kids are like,
I'm glad you're home,
dad.

1491
01:29:18.150 --> 01:29:21.300
You don't let it out of the hospital.
That's another thing that comes with,

1492
01:29:21.330 --> 01:29:25.030
I think with training all the time is we all know where we stand.
Yeah.

1493
01:29:25.110 --> 01:29:29.400
Like I mean if the,
if there's a person that's going to beat me in a bar fight,

1494
01:29:29.610 --> 01:29:34.140
I know him.
Like he,
it's a famous fighter.
It's a famous Jujitsu player.

1495
01:29:34.141 --> 01:29:37.040
It's someone that is a known public figure that is known for fighting you.

1496
01:29:37.041 --> 01:29:41.370
That's like,
who's going to give,
if it's a civilian that doesn't train,

1497
01:29:41.480 --> 01:29:45.990
I mean they don't,
they're not going to stand a chance for their friends jump in.

1498
01:29:45.990 --> 01:29:49.630
Of course you're,
you're going to have some issues,
but yes.
Yes.
The,
uh,

1499
01:29:49.690 --> 01:29:53.190
the best thing to do is avoid,
but does your wife,

1500
01:29:53.220 --> 01:29:56.220
when your wife knows that you train every day,

1501
01:29:56.280 --> 01:30:00.750
that you get after it every day,
that you're physically fit,
physically strong,

1502
01:30:01.020 --> 01:30:03.060
and knows that you could destroy that person?

1503
01:30:03.690 --> 01:30:07.290
Does she look down on you when you walk out of there?
No.
She's like,
well,

1504
01:30:07.291 --> 01:30:12.270
I'm glad I married an actual man instead of an idiot.
Right.
And it's not,

1505
01:30:12.290 --> 01:30:14.600
did that big of a deal to be like,
hey bro,
if you want to fight here,

1506
01:30:14.610 --> 01:30:15.443
come to this gym.

1507
01:30:15.510 --> 01:30:19.830
I'll be there tomorrow at 10 o'clock but I'm not going to fight out here and get

1508
01:30:19.831 --> 01:30:22.000
arrested.
But you know,
we're in sued by you after,

1509
01:30:22.050 --> 01:30:27.050
after I put you to sleep and then I make it so you can't use your arms anymore.

1510
01:30:27.870 --> 01:30:30.600
Forever.
Yeah.
And even that.
I mean really,

1511
01:30:30.601 --> 01:30:34.200
let's really admitted even doing that like,
hey,
you want to fight?

1512
01:30:34.201 --> 01:30:37.830
I do want to fight you.
Right?
But I,
you know,
I'm a smart fighter,

1513
01:30:37.840 --> 01:30:42.480
so even that little boy,
that's true.
Exactly.

1514
01:30:42.570 --> 01:30:45.690
As far as moves go,
although,
hey look,
I'm not,

1515
01:30:45.720 --> 01:30:49.020
if someone does that and posted on the internet or something like that or comes,

1516
01:30:49.170 --> 01:30:52.980
come on,
let's face it.
We all want to see that.
Oh,
part of us wants to see that.

1517
01:30:53.330 --> 01:30:56.040
You know,
you'll see the bully get beat up.
It's pretty common.

1518
01:30:56.041 --> 01:31:00.990
But really at the end of the day,
that's not the decision.
The decision,

1519
01:31:00.991 --> 01:31:03.870
isn't it?
Because it goes back when I said that earlier question,

1520
01:31:04.620 --> 01:31:08.790
if you're secure in your manhood,
there's not that big of a deal to go,
dude,

1521
01:31:08.791 --> 01:31:11.370
you're drunk and carry on.
I'm out of here with my wife.

1522
01:31:11.400 --> 01:31:13.710
We're going to go back to our house and carry on with our lives.

1523
01:31:13.711 --> 01:31:14.610
Like normal people.

1524
01:31:14.970 --> 01:31:18.210
You can find another person to get an a drunk fight with and ended up in jail.

1525
01:31:18.760 --> 01:31:21.330
Let me ask you this.
You can be honest,

1526
01:31:21.780 --> 01:31:26.490
even as a full grown secure man,

1527
01:31:27.390 --> 01:31:31.890
if you found yourself in that scenario
and you're like,
no,

1528
01:31:31.891 --> 01:31:36.000
me and my wife,
we're going to go home.
They're still a small party of course.

1529
01:31:37.090 --> 01:31:40.400
Well,
especially when you enjoy fighting.
Yeah.
You know what I mean?

1530
01:31:40.401 --> 01:31:42.920
When fighting is fun and actually,
you know,
um,

1531
01:31:43.290 --> 01:31:45.580
one of the guys at the gym who's a

1532
01:31:47.970 --> 01:31:52.740
brown belt,
Mike,
he hasn't trained much when you're there.
Anyways,
Mike Dude,

1533
01:31:52.741 --> 01:31:56.910
he's,
he usually goes in the morning.
Yeah.
He's usually there.
But anyway,
anyways,

1534
01:31:56.940 --> 01:32:01.530
um,
he had somebody like say something to you know,
uh,

1535
01:32:01.720 --> 01:32:05.560
somebody,
somebody like smacked his girlfriend's ass.
Like what?

1536
01:32:05.740 --> 01:32:09.910
Like he brought his girlfriend who into the bar and he does more tie of course,

1537
01:32:09.911 --> 01:32:13.070
and he did,
you just declare him,
he's a bad ass dude.
Um,

1538
01:32:13.180 --> 01:32:17.920
he walks into the bar and this guy just straight up just Bam,

1539
01:32:18.040 --> 01:32:23.040
slaps his girlfriend's ass and he like turned around boom.

1540
01:32:23.470 --> 01:32:28.180
One,
two to the head drop.
The guy needed the face out.

1541
01:32:28.580 --> 01:32:30.610
It was like,
Yep,
boom,
got arrested.

1542
01:32:31.390 --> 01:32:36.070
He paid $8,000 or something and did like 72 hours in jail.
I mean,
it was,

1543
01:32:36.071 --> 01:32:39.820
it was legit,
like Andy and he,
and he talks about it.
I mean,

1544
01:32:39.821 --> 01:32:43.510
just to show you like a different way.
And that's why I like his attitude,

1545
01:32:43.511 --> 01:32:45.130
you know,
I talked to him about and he's like,
yeah,
you know,

1546
01:32:45.131 --> 01:32:48.140
the guy crossed the line and then I had to put them down and it was like,
yeah,

1547
01:32:48.190 --> 01:32:52.900
okay.
Yeah.
And,
and that's,
that's an awesome story by the way.
It gives me like a,

1548
01:32:52.930 --> 01:32:56.980
for real,
like Mike,
you're the man,
but let's face it though,

1549
01:32:57.220 --> 01:33:01.690
that wasn't the right move as far as before you do it.
Yeah.
I mean,
you're right,

1550
01:33:01.691 --> 01:33:03.040
because we don't know what could have happened.

1551
01:33:03.600 --> 01:33:08.070
We know what the actual outcome was and it was like $8,000,
you know,

1552
01:33:08.380 --> 01:33:12.430
and his wife,
girlfriend,
girlfriend,
just his girlfriend don't know,

1553
01:33:12.431 --> 01:33:14.020
mess with bikes,
girl,
man.
Well,

1554
01:33:14.021 --> 01:33:16.210
I'm just saying if you have a wife and then on top of that,

1555
01:33:16.220 --> 01:33:20.770
if you have like a kid,
the $8,000 seems more detrimental.
Yeah,
that's true.

1556
01:33:21.240 --> 01:33:23.590
Um,
but you know,

1557
01:33:23.920 --> 01:33:27.460
so I'm saying this is why you treat people with respect.
Yeah.
You know,

1558
01:33:27.700 --> 01:33:29.650
cause otherwise you never know who you're messing with.

1559
01:33:29.740 --> 01:33:32.920
And Mike doesn't look like he's a big intimidating guy by any chance.

1560
01:33:32.920 --> 01:33:37.370
What does he weigh?
One 70.
I'm thinking of a different guy.
I realize it,
but,
um,

1561
01:33:37.410 --> 01:33:42.130
what,
what Mike's one 70.
He's tough.
He's a tough bastard too.
I mean,
on the Mat.

1562
01:33:42.490 --> 01:33:46.810
He's tough,
but he's,
he's like one 70 and you know what?

1563
01:33:46.811 --> 01:33:48.820
He's a brown belt in Jujitsu.
Really good with the Geek.

1564
01:33:48.970 --> 01:33:53.110
Andy wrestled like he wrestling high school,
so yeah.
Any,
any train boy.

1565
01:33:53.470 --> 01:33:55.250
So he's just a tough dude.
Yeah.

1566
01:33:55.540 --> 01:33:58.240
And you don't know who you're messing with and boom.

1567
01:33:58.480 --> 01:34:01.800
But the interesting thing is,
and you know this,
I know this,

1568
01:34:01.870 --> 01:34:04.840
when you make eye contact with another person in a situation like that,

1569
01:34:04.841 --> 01:34:06.730
you already know if they train or not.
You know,
you're like,
oh,

1570
01:34:06.731 --> 01:34:09.250
this got trains for sure.
I'm in for it.
You know,
is going to be,

1571
01:34:09.251 --> 01:34:12.700
it's going to be on,
you know,
that's awareness from the training,

1572
01:34:14.110 --> 01:34:18.810
but still
awesome story.
Don't do that.
Yeah.
Yeah,
I know.

1573
01:34:18.811 --> 01:34:22.590
Don't do what Mike did
Mike,
keep it up though.

1574
01:34:23.550 --> 01:34:27.120
Just kidding.
Just kidding.
Just kidding.
No,
Mike,
don't do it again.
Yeah,

1575
01:34:27.180 --> 01:34:30.210
don't mess with my ex girl.
Jocko,

1576
01:34:31.560 --> 01:34:34.800
were you very disciplined as a kid

1577
01:34:36.390 --> 01:34:41.390
and was there a set day or moment when you saw how important discipline was and

1578
01:34:42.361 --> 01:34:43.230
decided to do it?

1579
01:34:45.230 --> 01:34:46.063
<v 2>Well,</v>

1580
01:34:47.070 --> 01:34:51.690
<v 3>as a kid,
I think I was,
for the most part,
a kid</v>

1581
01:34:53.820 --> 01:34:57.980
I was not.
So I'm extremely disciplined kid.
I was,
I

1582
01:34:57.980 --> 01:35:00.470
<v 0>was pretty stubborn when it came to certain things,</v>

1583
01:35:00.471 --> 01:35:05.471
which may be some kind of in early immature form of discipline you have just

1584
01:35:06.501 --> 01:35:07.550
being hard headed.

1585
01:35:08.120 --> 01:35:11.750
But I think as I got older,

1586
01:35:11.870 --> 01:35:16.870
I saw the first thing I remember along these lines is seeing a lack of

1587
01:35:17.301 --> 01:35:20.720
discipline around me.
I didn't identify it as people having discipline.

1588
01:35:20.721 --> 01:35:24.740
I saw like a lack of discipline.
It's all weakness.
I saw drugs,
I saw alcohol,

1589
01:35:24.741 --> 01:35:28.070
I saw laziness
and I,

1590
01:35:28.250 --> 01:35:33.230
I started to get after it a little bit,
right.
A little bit,

1591
01:35:33.231 --> 01:35:37.160
a little tiny bit.
But there was no role models.
There was no internet,

1592
01:35:37.161 --> 01:35:41.810
there was no guidance.
And I didn't have the sense to,

1593
01:35:42.860 --> 01:35:47.030
to go to the library and find Bob Hoffman's book,

1594
01:35:47.031 --> 01:35:49.790
how to be happy,
healthy and strong.
Like I didn't know to do.

1595
01:35:49.800 --> 01:35:54.200
I know it makes sense to do that.
And so we did some basic things,

1596
01:35:54.201 --> 01:35:57.140
you know what I mean?
Some pushups,
you know,

1597
01:35:57.480 --> 01:36:02.480
if the Po push up workouts that I did when I was 13 years old are laughable.

1598
01:36:03.380 --> 01:36:06.950
Laughable.
I mean I think if I did,
you know,

1599
01:36:06.951 --> 01:36:11.630
a set of 50 pushups,
I was corn or you know,
boom,
I'm the man,
right?

1600
01:36:12.140 --> 01:36:15.610
You are the men 13 yeah.
And,

1601
01:36:15.630 --> 01:36:20.030
and we did some silly little like kind of Barbell dumbbell circuit training kind

1602
01:36:20.031 --> 01:36:22.730
of thing.
Now I always liked the military.

1603
01:36:23.300 --> 01:36:28.130
I recognize that as a some kind of a trade of discipline in there.

1604
01:36:28.520 --> 01:36:31.670
And I looked up to military veterans,

1605
01:36:32.630 --> 01:36:35.570
I knew one Marine Corps drill instructor

1606
01:36:37.070 --> 01:36:39.440
and if you know anything about Marine Corps drill instructors,

1607
01:36:39.800 --> 01:36:44.800
so now we're talking 85 86 87 there wasn't any wars going on.

1608
01:36:45.230 --> 01:36:47.300
But you know,
when you're a kid you're just like,

1609
01:36:47.360 --> 01:36:49.790
oh he's a Marine Corps drill instructor.
He fit the part,

1610
01:36:49.791 --> 01:36:52.520
he was just perfect Marine Corps boat drill instructor,

1611
01:36:52.550 --> 01:36:55.300
which most Marine Corps drill instructors are pretty damn perfect kits.

1612
01:36:55.380 --> 01:36:56.270
Incredibly,

1613
01:36:57.050 --> 01:37:02.050
incredibly honed s job that's very well choreographed and very and very

1614
01:37:05.511 --> 01:37:09.080
structured.
And it's a,
it's a very fine,
um,

1615
01:37:10.220 --> 01:37:11.710
real tight,
real tight.

1616
01:37:11.711 --> 01:37:14.990
It's a real tight situation if you're getting Marine Corps drill instructor.

1617
01:37:15.860 --> 01:37:19.280
And I knew one right when I was a kid and I just looked at it,
he was like a God,

1618
01:37:19.310 --> 01:37:21.920
right?
This guy is a marine corps are,
and of course he hadn't,

1619
01:37:21.980 --> 01:37:26.510
I think he had like a 68 Camaro,
so had a muscle car.
So you'll,
he was Josie ope,

1620
01:37:26.570 --> 01:37:30.860
like just the man.
And so now,
so I got that going on.
And then,

1621
01:37:31.510 --> 01:37:36.260
then there was the hardcore bands that I started listening to and they seem to

1622
01:37:36.261 --> 01:37:40.370
have some kind of,
it was something there,
right?

1623
01:37:40.371 --> 01:37:44.300
I recognized something there.
I recognize something with black flag.

1624
01:37:44.301 --> 01:37:48.260
I recognize something with bank called slap shot.

1625
01:37:48.600 --> 01:37:50.780
I recognize something with the Cro mags.

1626
01:37:50.780 --> 01:37:55.720
And I saw there was something in there and I,
and I,
I did,

1627
01:37:56.750 --> 01:38:00.870
I couldn't,
I can't,
I didn't know what it was,
but it was some kind of strength,

1628
01:38:01.200 --> 01:38:04.100
right.
Some kind of discipline was in there.
I,

1629
01:38:04.101 --> 01:38:09.101
I didn't put it all together though and there was no sort of unified way to go

1630
01:38:14.910 --> 01:38:18.300
down this path.
It didn't,
I didn't find that.

1631
01:38:20.250 --> 01:38:22.950
And I don't know if I found it,
if it,
what it would've looked like to me,

1632
01:38:22.951 --> 01:38:26.280
you know,
maybe you could say that that path was the boy scouts.

1633
01:38:26.670 --> 01:38:30.930
The boy scouts are a disciplined group of individuals that learn how to hike and

1634
01:38:30.960 --> 01:38:34.860
hunt.
And I mean,
so was that it?
I don't know.
I,

1635
01:38:34.861 --> 01:38:39.390
maybe I didn't identify that or I didn't have the right personality cause I was

1636
01:38:39.391 --> 01:38:43.590
kind of nonconformist right.
A little bit,
you know,
a little bit of a rebel.

1637
01:38:45.510 --> 01:38:48.730
So I didn't put it all together.
Um,

1638
01:38:50.250 --> 01:38:54.510
and I had some little flashes of like being hardcore with some of the things I

1639
01:38:54.511 --> 01:38:59.010
did that would it be like kind of getting after some really minor ways,
some,

1640
01:38:59.040 --> 01:39:01.860
some,
some minimalistic level of discipline.

1641
01:39:03.420 --> 01:39:07.890
But it wasn't until I started training in earnest to join the navy that I

1642
01:39:07.891 --> 01:39:12.600
started to what we could recognize now as getting after it a little bit.

1643
01:39:12.900 --> 01:39:17.580
You know,
it's,
and again,
it's nothing compared to what people do now,

1644
01:39:18.150 --> 01:39:20.930
what definitely not.
But you know,

1645
01:39:20.940 --> 01:39:25.940
now we're talking 1989 I was running through marshes and being covered in mud

1646
01:39:27.631 --> 01:39:31.290
and I was swimming in the ocean and I was doing pull ups and push ups and dips

1647
01:39:31.291 --> 01:39:32.640
and sit ups.
And again,

1648
01:39:32.641 --> 01:39:37.260
it's nothing compared to what I do now or even what everybody does now.

1649
01:39:38.340 --> 01:39:41.340
But I was doing what I could with what I knew at the time.

1650
01:39:42.420 --> 01:39:47.420
And I didn't really have any idea of what I,

1651
01:39:47.820 --> 01:39:52.200
or really what people in general were capable of.

1652
01:39:52.230 --> 01:39:54.930
Like I just didn't know.
I didn't know.

1653
01:39:55.260 --> 01:40:00.260
I never would have thought a good pullup workout is 500 to a thousand pumps.

1654
01:40:00.760 --> 01:40:03.060
I wouldn't have thought that,
you know,
for me,

1655
01:40:03.240 --> 01:40:06.840
I do three sets and pull ups and I was going to the,
or,
you know,

1656
01:40:07.530 --> 01:40:11.340
so I just,
I just didn't,
didn't know.

1657
01:40:11.940 --> 01:40:16.470
And
I guess,
I guess you could say I didn't even have,

1658
01:40:16.500 --> 01:40:19.620
I didn't know to even explore those,

1659
01:40:19.860 --> 01:40:23.460
those outer limits of what I was capable of,
you know,
which is a bummer.

1660
01:40:25.080 --> 01:40:29.370
Um,
no,
I don't say you got to remember,

1661
01:40:29.400 --> 01:40:33.860
I didn't even know another person that did pull ups.
Like we'll be there.
There's,

1662
01:40:33.870 --> 01:40:37.170
there wasn't like pull up bars around.
There wasn't,
uh,
you know,

1663
01:40:37.171 --> 01:40:40.910
I'm out in the woods somewhere in the woods in New England.
There's no pull.

1664
01:40:40.920 --> 01:40:43.170
There's people,
people aren't like,
hey,
how many pull ups can do?

1665
01:40:43.171 --> 01:40:44.160
I never heard that question.

1666
01:40:45.420 --> 01:40:49.080
And I didn't know anybody that swam in the open ocean.

1667
01:40:49.081 --> 01:40:52.240
I didn't know anybody that did push up workouts.
Right.
I Dunno,

1668
01:40:52.290 --> 01:40:56.800
I was just in the sticks.
And so when I joined the military,

1669
01:40:56.980 --> 01:41:01.840
I was a blank slate,
really for all practical purposes.
And it was really easy.

1670
01:41:01.870 --> 01:41:06.070
They say,
you do this,
this is what you do.
And you get advanced,
the switch to do,

1671
01:41:06.071 --> 01:41:07.450
to be ready.
This is what you do.

1672
01:41:08.320 --> 01:41:12.820
And I realized very quickly that the harder you worked,

1673
01:41:13.910 --> 01:41:18.850
the more disciplined you were,
the easier your life was.
The easier your job was,

1674
01:41:18.851 --> 01:41:21.640
easier day was the ease of your physical activities would get.

1675
01:41:21.641 --> 01:41:23.140
And when I got into the teams

1676
01:41:25.220 --> 01:41:28.000
and really going through buds when you're going through buds and when I finally

1677
01:41:28.001 --> 01:41:30.880
met guys that we're going to buds and we started doing a hundred pull ups and we

1678
01:41:30.881 --> 01:41:33.360
started doing 150 poles.
So we started doing 200 pushups,

1679
01:41:33.380 --> 01:41:35.110
a workout and then it was like,
Oh wow,

1680
01:41:35.111 --> 01:41:38.020
you can do a lot of stuff that was getting ready to go to buds and you go to

1681
01:41:38.021 --> 01:41:41.740
buds and I,
you know,
you realize that you,
that people,

1682
01:41:41.770 --> 01:41:46.330
it's not just this individual like um,
spiritual awakening.

1683
01:41:46.420 --> 01:41:49.240
Like no,
you just realize,
hey,
you can do a lot of pullups people can,

1684
01:41:49.330 --> 01:41:51.400
it's not that big of a deal.
And everybody knows you can find that out on the,

1685
01:41:51.401 --> 01:41:53.770
you don't need to go to buds to figure that out.
You can figure that out.

1686
01:41:53.800 --> 01:41:56.350
Just I'm telling you right now,
you know what I mean?

1687
01:41:56.620 --> 01:41:58.630
And all you need is to have that knowledge.

1688
01:41:59.170 --> 01:42:02.650
But I continued to realize that being disciplined,
all these things,

1689
01:42:02.800 --> 01:42:06.130
waking up earlier and working hard and training hard and keeping your gear

1690
01:42:06.131 --> 01:42:08.470
squared away and studying the material that we were supposed to know,

1691
01:42:08.471 --> 01:42:10.150
I realized that that work,

1692
01:42:10.270 --> 01:42:15.270
that discipline made life easier and it made us freer,

1693
01:42:19.070 --> 01:42:20.000
made me freer.

1694
01:42:21.590 --> 01:42:24.710
And the more time I spent in the teams,

1695
01:42:24.711 --> 01:42:26.960
the more this came in bedded in my head,

1696
01:42:26.961 --> 01:42:31.070
and not only as an individual did I realize this,

1697
01:42:31.071 --> 01:42:33.650
but I realized this very quickly.
We're not very quickly,

1698
01:42:33.651 --> 01:42:35.450
but as soon as I started moving into leadership positions,

1699
01:42:35.840 --> 01:42:39.400
I realized that the more disciplined a squad was over,

1700
01:42:39.401 --> 01:42:44.360
the more disciplined to put Tim in was the better that squatter of that platoon

1701
01:42:44.361 --> 01:42:45.590
was going to be.
And

1702
01:42:47.180 --> 01:42:50.570
that's kind of where the evolution,

1703
01:42:51.620 --> 01:42:52.610
the evolution of it.

1704
01:42:54.810 --> 01:42:58.110
<v 1>Yeah,
man,
it's that whole</v>

1705
01:42:59.760 --> 01:43:03.750
<v 2>process that I'm finally,
I don't want to say finally,</v>

1706
01:43:03.770 --> 01:43:07.710
but right now it's starting to become clear where the whole,

1707
01:43:07.740 --> 01:43:12.740
you know you're going to pay the price in at some point you're going to pay the

1708
01:43:12.811 --> 01:43:17.340
price for your actions.
So if you're going to prepare,

1709
01:43:17.370 --> 01:43:19.810
like let's say I'm going to get in shape,
right?

1710
01:43:20.850 --> 01:43:24.120
You committing to working out every day,

1711
01:43:25.260 --> 01:43:29.190
that's you paying a certain price and the like this didn't having the discipline

1712
01:43:29.191 --> 01:43:30.450
to do it,
you're going to pay the price.

1713
01:43:30.840 --> 01:43:34.290
We can early is not comfortable working on hard every day.
It's not comfortable.

1714
01:43:34.291 --> 01:43:39.150
You're going to pay a little price rate there the next day or the F,
you know,

1715
01:43:39.151 --> 01:43:41.790
in regards to the results of that workout,
you're not paying the price,

1716
01:43:41.791 --> 01:43:43.710
you're reaping kind of rewards.
Right.

1717
01:43:44.550 --> 01:43:48.720
Or you can not pay the price early with the workout and stuff,

1718
01:43:48.750 --> 01:43:53.300
but you still got it.
That tab is still outstanding.
So when you do,

1719
01:43:53.390 --> 01:43:56.510
yeah,
so when it comes results time there,
that's,

1720
01:43:56.810 --> 01:44:00.710
that's when you're going to pay your little price there,
your body,
your health,

1721
01:44:00.711 --> 01:44:05.000
whatever.
At some point you're going to have to pay a price.
Pay Now or pay later.

1722
01:44:05.060 --> 01:44:07.400
Yeah.
Mansell and pay now.

1723
01:44:07.430 --> 01:44:11.720
Pay Now you get way more benefit because like no one remembers.

1724
01:44:12.200 --> 01:44:14.020
Well we do.
Some of us do.
We,

1725
01:44:14.640 --> 01:44:17.750
I don't remember and take pleasure and remembering the time.

1726
01:44:17.751 --> 01:44:20.930
I skipped that workout because I wasn't feeling like doing it,
you know,

1727
01:44:21.040 --> 01:44:25.070
like that doesn't provide a sense of pleasure in my life to think back on those

1728
01:44:25.071 --> 01:44:28.520
days,
you know?
Yeah.
It's not good.
And at the same time,

1729
01:44:28.580 --> 01:44:32.240
when I think of like the detriment of doing the workout when I didn't feel like

1730
01:44:32.241 --> 01:44:36.260
it,
that doesn't,
that's not a bad memory to me.
You know,

1731
01:44:37.160 --> 01:44:38.810
when I do think back of like an,

1732
01:44:38.811 --> 01:44:42.210
or think even now if like the result of being in better shape than the,
you know,

1733
01:44:42.560 --> 01:44:45.890
the average person or we're going,
did you do so not gassing or whatever,

1734
01:44:46.370 --> 01:44:50.210
bringing in all the groceries at one time,
let's face it.
That's something

1735
01:44:52.760 --> 01:44:57.760
that is a sense of pleasure that I have the freedom to be able to do that one I

1736
01:44:58.560 --> 01:44:59.230
want,
I want,

1737
01:44:59.230 --> 01:45:02.320
<v 0>you know,
yeah.
You know,
what else is interesting about this,</v>

1738
01:45:02.321 --> 01:45:06.700
and sometimes I hear this,
um,
and you did this a couple times tonight,
right?

1739
01:45:07.420 --> 01:45:11.530
People go,
well yeah,
but your Jocko like as if I'm,

1740
01:45:11.620 --> 01:45:15.040
as if I'm not a normal person,
but you're not.

1741
01:45:15.160 --> 01:45:17.620
But I'm saying like,
you know her,

1742
01:45:17.621 --> 01:45:22.621
I just kind of went through like the story and it paints a pretty clear picture

1743
01:45:22.991 --> 01:45:26.200
that I'm a pretty normal person.
Yeah.
Right.
Yeah.
It's pretty normal.

1744
01:45:26.560 --> 01:45:31.560
But I made decisions along the way that maybe weren't normal and that may be

1745
01:45:33.641 --> 01:45:37.570
open the doors to being a little bit,

1746
01:45:37.870 --> 01:45:41.650
not normal.
Yeah.
But there are choices that you can make.
So,

1747
01:45:42.070 --> 01:45:45.640
so I'll have this with my kids too,
or you know who else?

1748
01:45:45.680 --> 01:45:49.960
Sometimes I'll have them.
I would have friends,

1749
01:45:50.560 --> 01:45:55.510
we'll say that would say,
you know,
well,
yeah,
you're,
that's you.

1750
01:45:55.720 --> 01:45:58.780
You know,
like I'd say no.
If you want to win this fight,
for instance,

1751
01:45:59.080 --> 01:46:01.090
you want to win this fight,
man,
you gotta,
you gotta do this,

1752
01:46:01.091 --> 01:46:04.660
you got to get after this,
you got 80 be like,
well,
you know,
it's not that easy.

1753
01:46:04.820 --> 01:46:09.100
And that's,
that's what you would do,
but you're,
you're,

1754
01:46:09.101 --> 01:46:13.950
you in.
That's,
you know,
it's almost like,
yeah,
it's unachievable.

1755
01:46:14.330 --> 01:46:19.090
Nothing applied.
And my kids will say that to me.
You know,
my kids.

1756
01:46:19.120 --> 01:46:24.120
And I think it's actually a pretty big detriment that they think that I'm not

1757
01:46:25.680 --> 01:46:28.210
that,
that,
oh,
I do it,
but,

1758
01:46:28.211 --> 01:46:33.070
but that's because I'm me and I'm the,
no,
it's not true.

1759
01:46:33.190 --> 01:46:37.840
It's not true.
And so,
you know,
occasionally I have,

1760
01:46:37.900 --> 01:46:41.380
I hear people say that and I go,
man,
this isn't like,

1761
01:46:41.980 --> 01:46:46.980
I guess it's kind of like what we were talking about the other day with someone

1762
01:46:47.021 --> 01:46:50.040
saying,
oh that's a good picture you took kind of camera.

1763
01:46:50.040 --> 01:46:54.600
<v 3>Did you use,
well it's kind of like that.
I'm like,
you know,
oh I wake up early.</v>

1764
01:46:55.020 --> 01:46:55.680
It doesn't,

1765
01:46:55.680 --> 01:47:00.680
it's not just because I just get fit or I work out a lot.

1766
01:47:01.320 --> 01:47:03.970
Oh,
did cause you're super motivated,
right?

1767
01:47:04.470 --> 01:47:08.010
Gifted and born motivated,
right?
No,

1768
01:47:08.011 --> 01:47:12.510
actually I'm a person and I grew up no person.
Yeah.

1769
01:47:12.870 --> 01:47:13.703
And so,

1770
01:47:14.610 --> 01:47:18.750
but it makes it very clear that these are just choices you can make and you can

1771
01:47:18.751 --> 01:47:22.110
get half it.
Totally true.
And I would say that it does,

1772
01:47:22.770 --> 01:47:27.630
when I say one,
anytime I would say consciously in meaningfully say,

1773
01:47:27.631 --> 01:47:31.980
well that's you is if I would be talking about a way of achieving the same
thing,

1774
01:47:31.981 --> 01:47:34.710
like you would do it this way.
I would try to do it this way kind of thing.

1775
01:47:34.770 --> 01:47:38.370
If I was confident that I could get the results,
you know,
like whatever that is.

1776
01:47:38.550 --> 01:47:42.410
But um,
when did I say it today?
What about your sleeping?
Your you,

1777
01:47:42.420 --> 01:47:46.620
you can do the four hour sleep and things or so more so than you can do the four

1778
01:47:46.621 --> 01:47:50.130
hours sleep and still function.
I meant you're into the four hours,

1779
01:47:50.131 --> 01:47:53.310
five hours sleep thing.
Yeah.
Which is cool.
But,

1780
01:47:53.340 --> 01:47:58.050
and I realize that there are some genetic points in there,
I believe.

1781
01:47:58.640 --> 01:48:01.440
Yeah.
I believe that there are some genetic points in there.

1782
01:48:01.441 --> 01:48:04.650
I believe there are some genetic points in,
in everything.
Right.

1783
01:48:05.190 --> 01:48:06.090
And I've told you this,

1784
01:48:06.210 --> 01:48:10.710
I have one of my daughters who is most similar to me,

1785
01:48:10.740 --> 01:48:15.740
both physically and mentally sleeps about the same as I do,

1786
01:48:17.250 --> 01:48:18.660
if not less.

1787
01:48:19.860 --> 01:48:24.860
One of my other daughters who is most physically and mentally,

1788
01:48:26.850 --> 01:48:29.100
well,
physically more like my wife.

1789
01:48:29.970 --> 01:48:32.640
She sleeps a lot.
Yeah.

1790
01:48:32.790 --> 01:48:37.790
And so there is a gym and my wife sleeps more than I do and so there is a

1791
01:48:38.761 --> 01:48:41.160
genetic component to it,
I believe in.

1792
01:48:41.160 --> 01:48:43.830
I've read articles and people send me you Twitter articles all the time.
Oh,

1793
01:48:43.831 --> 01:48:47.370
you're one of these,
you know,
fast sleepers,
the 2% of the population,

1794
01:48:47.371 --> 01:48:51.240
all of this stuff.
And I'm just saying,
okay,
yeah,
that's great.

1795
01:48:51.270 --> 01:48:52.470
But then people say,

1796
01:48:52.471 --> 01:48:56.940
oh well you just work out every day because you're super motivated or you just

1797
01:48:56.941 --> 01:49:01.000
train Jujitsu all the time because you're just super motivated.
It's like,
oh,

1798
01:49:01.080 --> 01:49:04.410
okay.
Right.
Yeah.
Well you know what?
Great.
Great,
great.
Yeah,

1799
01:49:05.250 --> 01:49:10.020
I think you're absolutely correct.
And even with the sleeping thing that is like,

1800
01:49:10.620 --> 01:49:14.730
because ultimately,
yeah,
if you don't have to sleep as much as the next person,

1801
01:49:14.731 --> 01:49:17.220
sure.
That's an advantage just because you have more time and that's it.

1802
01:49:17.460 --> 01:49:21.370
It's not like,
you know,
someone would,
would be like,
hey,

1803
01:49:21.560 --> 01:49:22.830
other than that reason to be like,
hey,

1804
01:49:22.831 --> 01:49:27.060
it's cooler or it's somehow more beneficial for me to sleep five hours rather

1805
01:49:27.061 --> 01:49:30.960
than my normal eight.
Like,
so,
I mean put it this way,

1806
01:49:30.961 --> 01:49:35.760
if someone wants to choose to sleep four hours just because you do it,

1807
01:49:35.761 --> 01:49:39.780
that's kind of weird.
Yeah.
Now that being said,

1808
01:49:40.410 --> 01:49:44.940
what's awesome is there are a bunch of people on,

1809
01:49:45.000 --> 01:49:48.130
on the interwebs,
a bunch of bad troopers

1810
01:49:48.700 --> 01:49:53.440
<v 0>that Eh,
have,
are,
are I,
I retweet almost all of these cause people go,</v>

1811
01:49:53.650 --> 01:49:58.060
hey,
you know,
I'm,
I lost 32 pounds.
Hey,

1812
01:49:58.180 --> 01:50:00.670
I lost 42 pounds.
Hey,

1813
01:50:00.910 --> 01:50:05.910
I did my first squat today with 300 pounds.
So,

1814
01:50:06.150 --> 01:50:06.720
and,
and,

1815
01:50:06.720 --> 01:50:10.140
and there's no difference in what they were doing before and what they're doing

1816
01:50:10.141 --> 01:50:13.600
now fundamentally in their,
in their genes or their,

1817
01:50:13.810 --> 01:50:18.160
or their physiology.
What they did is they decided to make these decisions.

1818
01:50:18.430 --> 01:50:19.960
They decided that they were going to go out,

1819
01:50:19.961 --> 01:50:21.460
they decided they were going to step up their game.

1820
01:50:21.461 --> 01:50:22.780
They're gonna decide you're gonna wake up early.

1821
01:50:22.781 --> 01:50:24.190
They decided they're going to clean up their diet.

1822
01:50:24.191 --> 01:50:27.130
They decided they were going to get after it.
And when they do that,

1823
01:50:27.131 --> 01:50:29.650
all of a sudden boom resolve.
And you know what?

1824
01:50:29.651 --> 01:50:31.970
You fast forward like six months and people were,

1825
01:50:31.990 --> 01:50:35.520
will you just do that because you're super motivated and they'll leave.

1826
01:50:35.560 --> 01:50:39.040
They'll be thinking,
no,
I'm not.
I'm,
I'm a person,
you know,

1827
01:50:39.370 --> 01:50:42.130
and I choose to get after it.

1828
01:50:44.450 --> 01:50:47.880
I recommend you all choose to get after it and I encourage that.
Any,

1829
01:50:47.890 --> 01:50:51.730
you know what?
It's not easy.
It's not easy.

1830
01:50:51.760 --> 01:50:55.150
There's the nagging weakness

1831
01:50:56.140 --> 01:51:00.710
<v 2>that is pulling you down.
Yeah,
and you got to shut that down.
Anything else?</v>

1832
01:51:00.711 --> 01:51:02.800
Talk to my friend Anthony about this.
Yesterday

1833
01:51:04.660 --> 01:51:08.560
and I always mentioned this case.
So decision making,
right?

1834
01:51:08.561 --> 01:51:12.160
We're wired this environment right now,

1835
01:51:12.161 --> 01:51:17.080
we're wired to not get after it in our brains were wired for the short term

1836
01:51:17.081 --> 01:51:20.080
payoff right now in times of scarcity,
you know,

1837
01:51:20.140 --> 01:51:22.690
I don't know if I'm mentioned there,
but you're wired to,

1838
01:51:22.691 --> 01:51:26.980
you better get it while you can.
Food mate,
rest,

1839
01:51:27.040 --> 01:51:28.930
read everything.
You better get it when you,

1840
01:51:28.960 --> 01:51:32.470
when you and your body starts to adapt to that environment because it's been

1841
01:51:32.471 --> 01:51:34.720
going on for so long.
So it's like,
man,
if you're tired,

1842
01:51:34.721 --> 01:51:37.090
that's your body telling you something.
You've got to get that rest.

1843
01:51:37.300 --> 01:51:42.220
You see some food,
some fat,
a lot of calories,
fat,

1844
01:51:42.221 --> 01:51:45.640
sugar,
a lot of energy.
Why don't you better get that?
You better eat it now.
Now,

1845
01:51:45.641 --> 01:51:48.010
physiologically your like that and mentally you're like that.

1846
01:51:48.040 --> 01:51:52.090
You're wired that way.
So my point,

1847
01:51:52.810 --> 01:51:56.590
hyperbolic discounting all of that is,

1848
01:51:57.010 --> 01:52:00.610
is choosing the short term payoff over the longterm payoff.

1849
01:52:00.700 --> 01:52:03.310
Oftentimes when the longterm comes,

1850
01:52:03.370 --> 01:52:07.840
you regret your short term payoff decision most of the time,
right?
Yeah.

1851
01:52:08.350 --> 01:52:10.540
So it's a spectrum.
You know,
there's some,
some,

1852
01:52:10.541 --> 01:52:12.340
some things are more or less detrimental.

1853
01:52:12.610 --> 01:52:16.930
So discounting is when you choose that short term payoff,

1854
01:52:17.230 --> 01:52:18.850
you can trace,

1855
01:52:18.910 --> 01:52:23.910
trace back all your success and failures to making that short term payoff

1856
01:52:25.210 --> 01:52:29.170
decision over the longterm payoff.
But here's the thing,
here's my point.

1857
01:52:29.840 --> 01:52:34.000
The odds are we,
you say it's,
it's not easy.
This is a fact.

1858
01:52:34.001 --> 01:52:35.980
It's not easy because you're not.
Why you have to learn,

1859
01:52:35.981 --> 01:52:38.860
you have to be trained out of discounting hypervolemic discount.

1860
01:52:38.861 --> 01:52:41.570
You gotta be trained out of it in one way or another.
Whether it's for an,

1861
01:52:41.580 --> 01:52:46.430
from somebody,
from your environment you're in.
You know,
like if everyone's,
if,

1862
01:52:46.550 --> 01:52:48.470
if everyone's eating healthy around you,

1863
01:52:49.340 --> 01:52:53.300
it's very unlikely that you're going to be like,
oh,
this is how you do it.
Okay,

1864
01:52:53.301 --> 01:52:55.820
I'm going to not do it.
You know,
it's,
it's,
it really unlikely.

1865
01:52:55.821 --> 01:52:59.270
So you can get trained by that way.
Bring invite.
But the point is you get,

1866
01:52:59.271 --> 01:53:02.630
you have to be trained out of this way of thinking because you're wired for it.

1867
01:53:03.080 --> 01:53:07.490
And all it is is the short term pay offers as long term payoff.
Like I said,

1868
01:53:07.491 --> 01:53:09.470
you've got to pay that price somewhere.

1869
01:53:09.650 --> 01:53:14.420
You might as well pay the price short turn now and get the benefits for the

1870
01:53:14.421 --> 01:53:17.510
longterm,
you know,
rather than discount.
But we're wired against it.

1871
01:53:17.511 --> 01:53:20.500
So that's why it's not easy,
but it train yourself out of it,
man.

1872
01:53:20.530 --> 01:53:24.710
You know how you train yourself out of it.
Do so plan,
get after it,
get after it.

1873
01:53:24.711 --> 01:53:28.730
Yeah,
it's true though.
It's absolutely true.
Speaking of instinct,

1874
01:53:30.200 --> 01:53:35.200
is it possible to train instinct and can we trust it wholly in fighting and in

1875
01:53:36.021 --> 01:53:36.854
leadership?

1876
01:53:39.190 --> 01:53:42.350
<v 0>Well,
first of all instinct is,
is,</v>

1877
01:53:42.610 --> 01:53:47.080
is it's like a voice and it's a voice that you can listen to and it's a voice

1878
01:53:47.081 --> 01:53:52.081
that you should listen to and you have to get to know your instincts,

1879
01:53:53.440 --> 01:53:54.400
right?
You have to get to know him.

1880
01:53:54.401 --> 01:53:58.900
You have to know how accurate they are and which ones you should listen to and

1881
01:53:58.901 --> 01:54:03.730
which ones you shouldn't listen to.
And it's real like with fighting,

1882
01:54:03.731 --> 01:54:04.930
it's very obvious with fighting,

1883
01:54:04.931 --> 01:54:07.870
you trained to a point that your instinct knows what to do.

1884
01:54:08.170 --> 01:54:11.770
So if someone gets in digging for an under hook on you,
you've you,

1885
01:54:11.830 --> 01:54:16.690
you swim to defend that under hook.
If someone gets the under hook,

1886
01:54:16.691 --> 01:54:18.280
boom,
you put on the wizard,
right?

1887
01:54:18.490 --> 01:54:23.490
Those are just instincts and it's good and it's good to have those instincts.

1888
01:54:24.810 --> 01:54:26.680
That's perfect.
Now,

1889
01:54:27.040 --> 01:54:29.860
sometimes even in fighting,

1890
01:54:31.270 --> 01:54:33.310
your instincts are actually wrong.

1891
01:54:33.760 --> 01:54:38.760
And I'll give you a very good example of this is Rohan with a guy by the name of

1892
01:54:38.981 --> 01:54:42.160
James Nielsen.
You have your old to James before many,
many,
many Caney.

1893
01:54:42.170 --> 01:54:45.370
So James Black belts been training forever.

1894
01:54:46.120 --> 01:54:50.590
He's got a different Jujitsu,
a different Jujitsu,

1895
01:54:50.591 --> 01:54:52.900
weird Jitsu.
It's weird.

1896
01:54:52.930 --> 01:54:57.850
It's different in the f'ing that you have to remember when you're rolling with

1897
01:54:57.851 --> 01:55:02.080
James is that your instincts are likely wrong.

1898
01:55:03.580 --> 01:55:06.100
It's crazy.
But your instincts are likely wrong.

1899
01:55:06.101 --> 01:55:09.760
And I know that that's a blanket statement and it's actually true.

1900
01:55:10.840 --> 01:55:15.520
For instance,
he wants you to pass guard and get across side.

1901
01:55:15.640 --> 01:55:19.690
He,
he wants you across side,
which is crazy and Jujitsu.

1902
01:55:20.140 --> 01:55:21.910
So your instinct to get passes,

1903
01:55:21.911 --> 01:55:25.990
guard and get across side and digging deep with your with with head control on

1904
01:55:25.991 --> 01:55:27.670
him and having his arm.
He,

1905
01:55:27.671 --> 01:55:31.870
that's what he wants you to do because he has a whole series of moves that he

1906
01:55:31.871 --> 01:55:32.410
does from there.

1907
01:55:32.410 --> 01:55:37.410
Now much like we were talking earlier about a long lanky guy that does moves

1908
01:55:37.781 --> 01:55:42.220
that no one's used to James does moves that people are not used to and the moves

1909
01:55:42.221 --> 01:55:46.450
that he does capitalize on your instincts.

1910
01:55:47.100 --> 01:55:48.240
So for instance,

1911
01:55:48.241 --> 01:55:52.140
when you trap his head from across side and you want to put your arm there and

1912
01:55:52.141 --> 01:55:53.430
you put it there and that's your instinct.

1913
01:55:53.550 --> 01:55:56.730
He wants you to put his arm dark cause he's going to get ahold of it,
trap it,

1914
01:55:56.731 --> 01:55:59.010
and he's got a sweep or norm he's going to set up from there.

1915
01:55:59.400 --> 01:56:04.400
So that's the thing you have to recognize and you have,

1916
01:56:04.740 --> 01:56:08.970
you can't just blanket obey your instincts all the time because sometimes your

1917
01:56:09.000 --> 01:56:13.740
instincts are going to be wrong.
That's the way it is.

1918
01:56:14.190 --> 01:56:17.310
And it is definitely the same thing in leadership

1919
01:56:19.560 --> 01:56:20.393
<v 1>and</v>

1920
01:56:21.460 --> 01:56:24.160
<v 0>w w when using instincts in leadership,</v>

1921
01:56:24.460 --> 01:56:28.240
the first thing that you kind of have to do is you have to become aware of your

1922
01:56:28.241 --> 01:56:31.420
instincts and you have to pay attention to them and pay attention to what you're

1923
01:56:31.421 --> 01:56:35.320
thinking and paying attention to what your instinct is.
A,
know your instinct,

1924
01:56:35.350 --> 01:56:40.350
and then look at the after the post mortem and see if your instinct was correct

1925
01:56:41.261 --> 01:56:42.094
or incorrect.

1926
01:56:42.910 --> 01:56:46.240
And then you've got to see how often you were right with your instinct and how

1927
01:56:46.241 --> 01:56:49.300
often you're instincts were wrong or what's your natural biases are.

1928
01:56:49.301 --> 01:56:52.690
For instance,
you've got some people that are there.

1929
01:56:52.691 --> 01:56:56.380
Their instinct is to positive,
right?
Oh,
you know,
we'll be able to get this done.

1930
01:56:56.580 --> 01:56:57.413
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

1931
01:56:58.060 --> 01:57:00.250
<v 0>and how often are you write about getting it done?</v>

1932
01:57:00.970 --> 01:57:02.500
And then you got some people that are too negative.

1933
01:57:02.590 --> 01:57:05.140
Their instinct is to negative.
Like,
we'll never be able to get this done.

1934
01:57:05.141 --> 01:57:08.050
We shouldn't even go.
No,
maybe you're wrong there.

1935
01:57:08.650 --> 01:57:13.500
There's some people instinctively
they trust people too much.

1936
01:57:14.120 --> 01:57:16.470
Stay,
go,
oh echo,
I know he's going to handle it.

1937
01:57:16.471 --> 01:57:18.870
I'm just gonna give him the project and he's going to run with it.
He's got it.

1938
01:57:19.920 --> 01:57:23.460
And there's some people that instinctively don't trust enough and they go,
man,

1939
01:57:23.461 --> 01:57:25.760
I'm not going to echo sock can be able to handle this.
I got to,

1940
01:57:25.780 --> 01:57:28.920
I got to micromanage them.
And so those,
those two,

1941
01:57:28.990 --> 01:57:33.360
those are examples of learning what your personal,

1942
01:57:33.390 --> 01:57:38.390
instinctive biases are so that you can calibrate them correctly.

1943
01:57:39.450 --> 01:57:44.450
And that way you can adjust your biases and you can mitigate their impact and

1944
01:57:46.591 --> 01:57:51.591
you can utilize them and give credence to them and understand them and utilize

1945
01:57:53.611 --> 01:57:58.350
them to the best of your ability and both leadership and

1946
01:57:59.880 --> 01:58:04.560
fighting both of them as the more you do,

1947
01:58:04.840 --> 01:58:07.020
the more you pay attention to your instincts,

1948
01:58:07.140 --> 01:58:10.410
the better they're both going to both become.
Now,

1949
01:58:12.090 --> 01:58:13.650
that being said,

1950
01:58:14.160 --> 01:58:19.160
there's another kind of instinct that you need to be on the lookout for it,

1951
01:58:19.591 --> 01:58:21.090
and this one is a liar.

1952
01:58:22.500 --> 01:58:26.180
This one is a sabbath tour.
Oh,

1953
01:58:26.190 --> 01:58:27.650
this one is a back

1954
01:58:30.480 --> 01:58:33.990
and like the devil himself,

1955
01:58:33.991 --> 01:58:36.000
he's a shape shifter.

1956
01:58:36.180 --> 01:58:41.180
He's going to disguise himself and make you think he's got your best interest in

1957
01:58:42.191 --> 01:58:46.180
mind,
but he doesn't.

1958
01:58:48.010 --> 01:58:51.670
This is the instinct that says you've had enough.

1959
01:58:53.400 --> 01:58:56.980
This is the instinct that says you've,
you've,
you've given it your best shot.

1960
01:58:57.430 --> 01:59:01.810
You can,
you can stand down,
you can back off.

1961
01:59:03.250 --> 01:59:04.150
You can take a knee.

1962
01:59:07.310 --> 01:59:12.080
This is the instinct that says you can rest now,

1963
01:59:16.000 --> 01:59:20.920
do not listen to that instinct.
Do not listen.

1964
01:59:21.970 --> 01:59:25.600
That instinct is a liar and wants to bring you down.

1965
01:59:26.920 --> 01:59:30.670
That's the instinct.
That's a defense mechanism.

1966
01:59:31.720 --> 01:59:36.720
Wants to give you an out place to run to little little places,

1967
01:59:38.050 --> 01:59:40.690
sympathy and amnesty,

1968
01:59:40.691 --> 01:59:44.050
a little place of amnesty where everything is forgiven.

1969
01:59:44.830 --> 01:59:45.970
We're all these,

1970
01:59:46.690 --> 01:59:51.690
these failures can gather together and comfort and drown their sorrows in the

1971
01:59:53.390 --> 01:59:55.360
lies and in deception.

1972
01:59:58.160 --> 02:00:00.080
And they tell each other

1973
02:00:02.120 --> 02:00:05.870
and they'll tell you,
you did the best you could.

1974
02:00:07.830 --> 02:00:11.790
No,
they'll say the deck,
the deck,
the deck was stacked against you

1975
02:00:13.680 --> 02:00:16.770
and they'll say it's not your fault.

1976
02:00:19.360 --> 02:00:23.020
And they'll tell you it's okay to stop.

1977
02:00:24.470 --> 02:00:25.790
It's okay to settle.

1978
02:00:26.330 --> 02:00:29.510
It's okay to give up.

1979
02:00:33.350 --> 02:00:35.930
And that is the instinct you need to fight.

1980
02:00:36.080 --> 02:00:40.130
You need to push back to smash into the ground.

1981
02:00:41.240 --> 02:00:43.970
Do not take the easy way out

1982
02:00:45.530 --> 02:00:49.130
to not give up based on instinct.

1983
02:00:49.310 --> 02:00:54.310
If you are forced to stand down to retreat so that you can rebuild and re

1984
02:00:57.071 --> 02:00:59.720
attack.
So be it.

1985
02:01:01.630 --> 02:01:06.040
But make that decision based on logic,

1986
02:01:07.420 --> 02:01:12.420
not on the instinct of surrender and defeat.

1987
02:01:15.740 --> 02:01:20.740
And you need to train that instinct,

1988
02:01:21.740 --> 02:01:25.580
your instinct,
train it to say,
get up,

1989
02:01:26.630 --> 02:01:28.610
go fight on.

1990
02:01:32.350 --> 02:01:35.770
And if that is what you become,

1991
02:01:35.771 --> 02:01:40.700
if that becomes your fundamental reaction to adversity,

1992
02:01:40.760 --> 02:01:43.490
if that becomes your gut instinct,

1993
02:01:47.530 --> 02:01:48.363
<v 2>then</v>

1994
02:01:49.330 --> 02:01:53.410
<v 0>you will overcome just about anything that stands in your bath.</v>

1995
02:02:00.360 --> 02:02:05.270
<v 2>You know,
I think that's
about all I've got for tonight.</v>

1996
02:02:10.500 --> 02:02:13.860
So

Yes.
Well,
we'll start with an efficient way.

2000
02:02:34.451 --> 02:02:38.020
We'll say that anyway.
Amazon,

2001
02:02:38.850 --> 02:02:41.890

We get a little tiny percentage yet,</v>

2005
02:02:57.050 --> 02:02:58.790
but it is true.

2006
02:02:58.791 --> 02:03:02.210
Will you add all those little small percentages together?

2007
02:03:02.460 --> 02:03:05.800
It provides us with something to help us out with the pod.
It's very supportive.

2008
02:03:05.920 --> 02:03:10.310
It's very supportive.
It may not seem like a big deal,
but as a group,

2009
02:03:11.030 --> 02:03:13.490
it's very supportive and it's very helpful.
So,
Yup.

2010

2025
02:04:07.780 --> 02:04:10.990
I think some,
some good supplements,

2026
02:04:10.991 --> 02:04:13.330
which is saying a lot because there's,
you know,

2027
02:04:13.810 --> 02:04:17.560
there's a lot of not good supplements up there on it.

2028
02:04:17.560 --> 02:04:22.300
Supplements the best.
It's like,
it's not even really a debate anymore really.

2029
02:04:22.510 --> 02:04:24.400
No,
I don't want to think it's a debate in any given,

2030
02:04:24.401 --> 02:04:27.670
like what we're trying to do,
what all of us are trying to do here in the group.

2031
02:04:27.910 --> 02:04:30.280
If you're in the game,
isn't it?
There's no room.
Yeah,

2032
02:04:30.460 --> 02:04:35.460
so it's not like you're not going to find a power gainer 5,000 chocolate protein

2033
02:04:38.460 --> 02:04:42.270
tub of powder.
It's not that.
It's like legit supplements.

2052
02:05:49.830 --> 02:05:54.450

02:06:25.530 --> 02:06:29.030
Oh yeah.
And I'm going to take some input and be fired up it.

2062
02:06:29.310 --> 02:06:33.930
It's motivating when people are fired up and leaving reviews,
it's connection,

2063
02:06:34.290 --> 02:06:36.330
you know?
And it makes me go,
you know what?

2064
02:06:36.660 --> 02:06:40.510
I'm going to get the same a little bit harder when he's like,
Dad,

2065
02:06:40.520 --> 02:06:45.000
chuck was very articulate.
Makes Jukka want to be even more articulate,
right?

2066
02:06:45.900 --> 02:06:49.510
Yes it does.
Indeed.
Amen.
Do that.
And you know,

2067
02:06:49.910 --> 02:06:53.730
helps do that actually helps the ratings or something with,

2068
02:06:54.240 --> 02:06:56.880
with iTunes when there's more reviews.

2069
02:06:56.910 --> 02:07:01.440
So why do we want to have good readings ratings?
So then it gets bumped up.

2070
02:07:01.441 --> 02:07:03.480
Why do we want a bumped up some more people?
Let's do it.

2071
02:07:03.481 --> 02:07:04.860
Why do we want more people to listen to it?

2072
02:07:05.010 --> 02:07:08.520
Because we want more people getting after it.
We want more people to do better.

2073
02:07:08.660 --> 02:07:13.050
Yeah.
I want,
I want more people in the game.
Yeah.
I want to get more feedback.

2074
02:07:13.051 --> 02:07:13.980
I want to talk to more people.

2075
02:07:15.450 --> 02:07:19.950
When I see Brady Lanter at his Jujitsu class saying,

2076
02:07:19.980 --> 02:07:24.750
I just got,
after it told me Lou,
he lost 30 pounds,
takes Jujitsu now

2077
02:07:26.310 --> 02:07:29.650
that's what we want more of.
That's what I want more.

2078
02:07:30.000 --> 02:07:31.710
And I'm assuming you think that's why.

2079
02:07:31.740 --> 02:07:35.010
So ultimately it really comes down to that.
Definitely.

2080
02:07:36.630 --> 02:07:38.920
<v 0>I hate to use the word motivated,
but I guess there was no other word.</v>

2081
02:07:39.340 --> 02:07:44.050
I am definitely motivated by the people that are making their lives better.

2082
02:07:44.080 --> 02:07:46.720
That of the people that are getting better physically by the people that are

2083
02:07:46.721 --> 02:07:51.400
getting better mentally that write me an email or send me a note that says,

2084
02:07:51.520 --> 02:07:56.410
oh,
had to use some,
had to use some flanking on my boss today.
Got Him.

2085
02:07:56.720 --> 02:08:00.700
But that is good to go.
Thousand percent that's what I like to hear

2086
02:08:00.750 --> 02:08:03.060
<v 2>when someone says,
Hey Echo,</v>

2087
02:08:03.450 --> 02:08:07.500
can I use your injectables likeness in a thing on my bulletin board for my

2088
02:08:07.501 --> 02:08:11.490
students to employee extreme ownership.
Can I do that?

2089
02:08:12.000 --> 02:08:15.780
Just the fact that that's a question he wants to ask.
Makes it

2090
02:08:15.860 --> 02:08:18.890
<v 0>just,
just a nursing.
So I talked about today.</v>

2091
02:08:19.040 --> 02:08:21.800
I didn't know about getting after it when I was 13 years old.

2092
02:08:21.801 --> 02:08:23.690
Imagine somebody being in a classroom and being like,
Hey,

2093
02:08:24.020 --> 02:08:26.360
you want to get after it?
Here's what you gotta do.
Here it is.

2094
02:08:26.660 --> 02:08:29.150
Here's a couple of guys they're getting after it.
Do you know what?

2095
02:08:29.240 --> 02:08:32.750
Why don't you get after it?
13 year old boy,
13 year old girl.

2096
02:08:32.900 --> 02:08:34.940
Why don't you make something happen?
You know what?

2097
02:08:34.970 --> 02:08:37.550
You know there's people that do 500 pull ups a workout.

2098
02:08:37.760 --> 02:08:41.810
They don't do 28 28 doesn't mean anything around here.
Step up your game.

2099
02:08:42.350 --> 02:08:47.350
So exposing the world so that people can do better,

2100
02:08:48.770 --> 02:08:50.630
do more,
be more.

2101
02:08:51.510 --> 02:08:55.110
<v 2>Go.
Yeah.
If you had more people being less abrasive,</v>

2102
02:08:55.140 --> 02:08:57.660
losing their temper lef or less,
um,

2103
02:08:58.560 --> 02:09:03.560
exercising extreme ownerships and discipline and all things pursuing freedom,

2104
02:09:04.110 --> 02:09:08.040
three discipline,
that is a better place across the board.

2105
02:09:09.580 --> 02:09:13.870
<v 0>You might even go so far as to say unmitigated daily discipline in all things.</v>

2106
02:09:14.350 --> 02:09:17.520
<v 2>Yup.
So that's the ultimate goal.</v>

2107
02:09:19.170 --> 02:09:23.070
Also,
subscribe to you too.
If you want.

2108
02:09:23.720 --> 02:09:26.910
Let some more videos on there aside from just the podcast video.

2109
02:09:27.540 --> 02:09:30.840
Add some more videos on there.
And we have been,

2110
02:09:31.450 --> 02:09:36.070
<v 0>and I think that we,
not you echo,
but we,</v>

2111
02:09:36.071 --> 02:09:36.904
the rest of us,

2112
02:09:37.450 --> 02:09:41.380
I think we can motivate you more to make more videos.

2113
02:09:41.381 --> 02:09:43.540
Cause every time you make a video,
like when you,
when you,

2114
02:09:43.570 --> 02:09:48.070
not just a clip of the podcast,
but when you make a legit video,

2115
02:09:48.850 --> 02:09:52.450
I'm always idea and I think a lot of people say the same thing and there's

2116
02:09:52.480 --> 02:09:54.100
actually a lot of troopers out there that are,

2117
02:09:54.190 --> 02:09:59.190
that are making badass video as to who's at Jean Jean Roderick gene router.

2118
02:09:59.330 --> 02:10:02.230
I could make some killer videos.

2119
02:10:02.560 --> 02:10:05.950
Can we put his videos on the Jocko podcast page?

2120
02:10:06.490 --> 02:10:11.140
I think I did a Dang,
I haven't put videos on there in a while,
but um,
yes we can,

2121
02:10:11.180 --> 02:10:12.190
we should use,
we will,

2122
02:10:12.520 --> 02:10:17.520
we should do that so that everybody can see all the trooper work that goes out

2123
02:10:17.591 --> 02:10:18.160
there.

2124
02:10:18.160 --> 02:10:21.800
<v 2>What it does to,
in this small little way where you know,
like,
okay,</v>

2125
02:10:21.801 --> 02:10:25.640
you'll say some words,
you'll say [inaudible] [inaudible] say what you say.

2126
02:10:25.880 --> 02:10:27.530
And I take it a certain way.
I'm like,
Dang.

2127
02:10:27.531 --> 02:10:29.980
That really hit me at resonated with me.

2128
02:10:31.910 --> 02:10:34.160
Other people,
other words might hit

2129
02:10:34.160 --> 02:10:37.250
<v 3>them harder or less harder or whatever.</v>

2130
02:10:37.251 --> 02:10:40.790
So if people have like video editing skills,
you know,

2131
02:10:40.791 --> 02:10:44.150
or they know how to video edit and stuff like that and put tracks and do that

2132
02:10:44.151 --> 02:10:47.420
stuff when they put it out,
it's,
it's kind of,

2133
02:10:47.450 --> 02:10:51.100
it is a representation of how those words hit them,
you know,

2134
02:10:51.160 --> 02:10:54.710
is that like you make a decision to put a certain type of track behind what

2135
02:10:54.711 --> 02:10:58.400
you're saying for a reason.
So it's so interesting to see,
Dang,

2136
02:10:58.401 --> 02:11:01.450
that's how that hit him,
you know,
in this field,

2137
02:11:01.460 --> 02:11:04.250
this feeling is how it hit him and it's like,
Dang,

2138
02:11:04.251 --> 02:11:08.120
you kind of get a different dimension of it.
It's cool too,
because for me,

2139
02:11:09.180 --> 02:11:13.600
I'm,
I don't hear my words,
my words right.

2140
02:11:13.700 --> 02:11:17.330
Then I hear my words with,

2141
02:11:18.470 --> 02:11:20.180
with the same thing you were saying,

2142
02:11:20.181 --> 02:11:23.890
like the way it's entering their brain because we didn't get your video right.

2143
02:11:23.930 --> 02:11:27.980
When you make a video,
it's reflection of what's going on in your mind.
Yeah.

2144
02:11:28.310 --> 02:11:32.360
And so like some of those videos that gene made,
I was like,

2145
02:11:33.440 --> 02:11:35.850
oh yeah.
Like yeah,
like it's going,

2146
02:11:35.900 --> 02:11:39.530
it's taken me inside his head and what appears to be from inside his head,

2147
02:11:39.680 --> 02:11:43.550
which is awesome to hear and awesome to see.
You know?
So we,
yeah,

2148
02:11:43.551 --> 02:11:44.540
we should get those.

2149
02:11:44.570 --> 02:11:48.530
And he had a couple of that one didn't go through the copyrighted material.

2150
02:11:48.740 --> 02:11:52.610
I don't know if he took the wrong songs or some,
uh,
it was a bummer.

2151
02:11:53.000 --> 02:11:56.030
Some of those were awesome.
Yeah,
that's part of the battle right there I think.

2152
02:11:56.031 --> 02:11:59.030
But Hey,
you know,
which,
whichever,
anyways,

2153
02:11:59.031 --> 02:12:03.710
what I was going to say is I think the more people that are youtube subscribers,

2154
02:12:03.830 --> 02:12:07.160
I think the more motivated that you will personally get.

2155
02:12:07.161 --> 02:12:11.780
That's my opinion to make even more bad ass videos.

2156
02:12:11.810 --> 02:12:12.643
That's my opinion.

2157
02:12:12.800 --> 02:12:15.880
Like you think it might get like a competition who can make the better one?
No,

2158
02:12:15.890 --> 02:12:18.110
no,
no,
no.
I,
I don't think that,

2159
02:12:18.140 --> 02:12:21.470
I think you're inspired by this video is the same way I am that other people

2160
02:12:21.471 --> 02:12:24.350
make.
But I'm saying I think you will just be motivated more.

2161
02:12:24.370 --> 02:12:25.290
The more people like that.

2162
02:12:25.291 --> 02:12:29.810
You know when you say a video has just been uploaded by Jocko podcast and you

2163
02:12:29.811 --> 02:12:33.800
didn't know that it's going to 50,000 people,
it'll be like boom,
click,
boom,

2164
02:12:33.801 --> 02:12:34.041
click.

2165
02:12:34.041 --> 02:12:38.030
You'll start getting after a little bit more and personally I want you to get

2166
02:12:38.031 --> 02:12:42.320
after it more.
The direct approach.
Dig It.

2167
02:12:42.620 --> 02:12:43.730
The pros is one,

2168
02:12:43.731 --> 02:12:46.790
it was like one of the original ones that someone else we'd fight hate that.

2169
02:12:46.791 --> 02:12:51.080
I can't remember like the names of the people did it but it's the one,

2170
02:12:51.081 --> 02:12:56.030
it was to
the Pacific soundtrack is one of the original ones.

2171
02:12:56.090 --> 02:13:00.260
All skill.
I'll,
I'll admit I was drinking one night just in front of them.

2172
02:13:00.320 --> 02:13:01.700
Yeah it was.
Yeah it was all the time.

2173
02:13:01.720 --> 02:13:05.430
And you may drink it that made you drink even more.
Drink,
eat some US playing.

2174
02:13:05.480 --> 02:13:08.090
I was like Bro,
I'm feeling this so deeply right now.

2175
02:13:08.120 --> 02:13:12.060
I played like literally like eight to 12 times just inner rolling Dane.

2176
02:13:12.080 --> 02:13:15.710
This is so like,
just cause you see their clips from movies,

2177
02:13:15.920 --> 02:13:19.880
there clips from this and it's,
it's a,
it's a Mashup and you know,
the,

2178
02:13:19.881 --> 02:13:24.380
the music and here's the thing,
it's not like hard core music.
It's not,
it's just,

2179
02:13:24.381 --> 02:13:27.090
it's like,
man,
it's,
it's really good.
Um,

2180
02:13:27.780 --> 02:13:31.830
and I think like I said,
that's like such a good to see

2181
02:13:32.580 --> 02:13:35.550
<v 2>not only just your words,
but how someone else hurt them,</v>

2182
02:13:35.610 --> 02:13:38.400
interpreted them and put them back out there.
It's awesome.
You're like,
Dang.

2183
02:13:38.401 --> 02:13:42.360
It's like a whole nother dimension anyway.
Um,
yes.

2184
02:13:42.640 --> 02:13:46.030
I'll get more on the youtube for sure.
I'm already more on the youtube,

2185
02:13:46.470 --> 02:13:50.060
but I'll keep it,
I'll keep it up.
I'll do some more.
We'll do some different

2186
02:13:50.090 --> 02:13:52.020
<v 0>top,
let me start making some videos.
Yeah.</v>

2187
02:13:55.510 --> 02:13:58.960
<v 2>Also to support this podcast.</v>

2188
02:13:59.200 --> 02:14:02.500
In the event of you being in the mood to support this podcast,

2189
02:14:04.060 --> 02:14:05.440
you can get some cool stuff.

2190
02:14:05.470 --> 02:14:09.760
I think it's cool@jockostore.com t shirts,

2191
02:14:10.240 --> 02:14:14.860
they have multiple layers to him.
Not physically,
psychologically,
philosophically.

2192
02:14:14.920 --> 02:14:18.790
They have multiple layers to them.
All of them.
Some Easter eggs too.

2193
02:14:20.080 --> 02:14:23.560
I'm sure it's travel mugs and bumper stickers now.

2194
02:14:23.561 --> 02:14:26.110
New stuff that's available right now,

2195
02:14:26.440 --> 02:14:28.420
well may or may not be available in may be sold out,

2196
02:14:28.450 --> 02:14:33.340
but they could be on back order.
You can order it.
Yes.
Um,
new stuff.

2197
02:14:33.370 --> 02:14:36.400
Rash guards.
