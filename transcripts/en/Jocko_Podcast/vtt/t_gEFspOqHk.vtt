00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:05.350
This is Jocko podcast number 52 with Echo Charles and me,

2
00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:09.950
Jocko Willink.
Good Evening Echo.
Good evening.

3
00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:12.433
So

4
00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:18.580
today is the 52nd episode of the Jocko podcast,

5
00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:27.430
which means that it's been one year since we put out one every week and people

6
00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:29.300
been asking me,
you know,
hey,

7
00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:34.820
you got to do anything special for the one year anniversary.

8
00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.990
A special guest or a special book is,
you know,

9
00:00:38.991 --> 00:00:43.760
what are you going to do special on this day?
And my answer is yes,

10
00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:50.150
we are going to do something special because today is special.

11
00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:58.140
But today isn't special because it's the 52nd podcast.

12
00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:04.420
Does he just just like I don't go overboard with special holidays like birthdays

13
00:01:05.981 --> 00:01:09.670
or Christmas or Valentine's Day or veterans day or even Memorial Day

14
00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:17.650
today isn't special because it's the 52nd podcast today is special

15
00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:22.040
because it's today.

16
00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:29.890
Today is special because we are alive because we're breathing.

17
00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:38.080
And when you're here and you're alive and you recognize that,

18
00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:43.450
recognize that that's you're alive today,

19
00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:49.540
that makes every day special,
makes every day a miracle,

20
00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:55.940
makes everyday a gift.
And that might seem like a

21
00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:59.350
tripe platitude,

22
00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:02.323
<v 1>but it isn't.</v>

23
00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:09.530
<v 0>And if you've seen brave young men who give their lives on the battlefield for</v>

24
00:02:10.671 --> 00:02:11.750
their brothers,

25
00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:19.280
or you've seen stoic young children facing some kind of terminal disease,

26
00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:26.190
or you would have had deaf,

27
00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:27.590
<v 1>okay,</v>

28
00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:32.590
<v 0>attack your life with its multitude of heartless weapons,</v>

29
00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:38.170
cancer and disease and suicide and accidents and addiction and murder and war.

30
00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:45.700
And if you've seen those things,

31
00:02:45.701 --> 00:02:50.050
then you know it isn't a platitude and it isn't cliche.
You know,
it's true

32
00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:54.133
<v 1>every day.</v>

33
00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:00.750
<v 0>It's a special day.
Every day is a gift.
Every day is awesome.
Okay,</v>

34
00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:07.130
and so what are we going to do special for this podcast right here?

35
00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:10.850
The same thing that we always do.
We're going to give it everything we've got.

36
00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:15.860
We're going to leave it all on the mat.
We prepared,
we invested,
we studied,

37
00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:18.470
we thought,
and we're going to get after it.

38
00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:21.193
<v 1>Why</v>

39
00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:25.930
<v 0>not?
Because this is number 52 not because it's been one year,</v>

40
00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:28.360
not because we made it this far,

41
00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:35.940
but because this is the one,
it's the one,

42
00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:41.760
the one life we have,
this is the one shot we get at today,

43
00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:43.950
this day now.

44
00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:52.990
And so we're going to get after it like we always do and we're going to make it

45
00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:58.440
<v 1>count.
So</v>

46
00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:03.900
<v 0>yeah.
Cool.
Let's do this now.</v>

47
00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:07.770
I did go a little bit long with the last last podcast.
You know,

48
00:04:07.771 --> 00:04:12.771
we were introducing the Korean War and the coldest war on that last episode.

49
00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:18.240
So I went a little,
I went a little crazy on that one.
Amen.

50
00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:20.700
We all need to hear about that and we're going to hear some more.

51
00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:24.210
But today we're going straight to Q and a

52
00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:28.280
<v 1>from,
from the interwebs.</v>

53
00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:34.160
So Echo Charles,
what do you got?

54
00:04:34.161 --> 00:04:38.540
Question number one.
Go.
All right.

55
00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:42.620
Okay.
First Question Jocko.

56
00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:48.520
<v 0>How did you have time to train in martial arts while deployed?</v>

57
00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:53.020
I figure that you were too busy with combat team and think about training while

58
00:04:53.021 --> 00:04:57.730
deployed.
Thank you for any information.
Okay.
So,

59
00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:00.400
um,
a couple things.

60
00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:05.770
I always brought mats with me when we deployed and there was really good,

61
00:05:05.771 --> 00:05:07.390
you know,
cause then once I was in a leadership position,

62
00:05:07.391 --> 00:05:09.910
I could kind of make that happen pretty easily.
How does that,

63
00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.560
how does that happen?
Do you just say,
Hey,
do you tell somebody mats?
No,

64
00:05:14.561 --> 00:05:18.100
I had mats and actually got matched from the team and then we would just put

65
00:05:18.101 --> 00:05:20.440
them on a big palette.
When you deploy you,
you go on,

66
00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:22.720
you put all your gear on these big pallets.

67
00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:24.770
So some of those pallets would have mats on mats.

68
00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:28.270
And then when we would go into plumbing,

69
00:05:28.271 --> 00:05:31.810
I prewar it was,
you know,
we,
we go on deployment,

70
00:05:31.811 --> 00:05:34.060
we'd just bring mats and train wherever we could train.

71
00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:39.520
And then once the war started in,
I still brought mats.
Those are,

72
00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:43.210
hey war,
there isn't,
it's not like we're going to have us working 24 hours a day.

73
00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:45.550
So,
and if they did,
we just wouldn't be able to train.

74
00:05:45.551 --> 00:05:46.810
But I was prepared for training.

75
00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:49.960
And what would I did both of my deployments to Iraq is I had a,

76
00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:53.440
what's called a GP medium tent,
which is basically a really,

77
00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:58.640
really big tent and they have air conditioning and they have dual walls so it

78
00:05:58.641 --> 00:06:02.000
stays kind of cool and I just made that into a little mini fight room,

79
00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:06.500
put mats out and then I would just train right when there was downtime and there

80
00:06:06.501 --> 00:06:08.120
is downtime when you're on deployment,

81
00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:11.510
I mean there is definitely downtime or you're on deployment and like what are

82
00:06:11.511 --> 00:06:13.670
you going to do with your downtime is the question.

83
00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:16.010
Now some guys with their downtime,

84
00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:19.700
they decide to do something that's maybe not super productive.

85
00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:25.270
Give you an example that there was some guys on my first deployment to Iraq and

86
00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:30.680
they played halo.
It's a video game.
Have you heard of it?
Okay.

87
00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:35.420
It's a first person shooter video game and so my guys were,

88
00:06:35.421 --> 00:06:38.180
so they just played anytime we weren't working,

89
00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:39.770
which you know our missions at that point,

90
00:06:39.771 --> 00:06:42.470
we're doing a little direct action missions.
They don't take a few hours even,

91
00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:46.580
you know,
the planning and you know,
every two or three days.
So you had time,

92
00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:49.250
right?
And so all the time,
and they had the,

93
00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:53.370
they had wires set up so they could play different,
um,

94
00:06:53.570 --> 00:06:57.830
each other in different tents.
It was really ridiculous.

95
00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:00.940
And meanwhile,
the guys that were a little more hardcore,
we were training,

96
00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:04.490
she has butter but,
but these guys,
and actually these guys were good mugs too.

97
00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:07.670
But what's funny is,
so I kind of thought like,
what is wrong with these guys?

98
00:07:07.671 --> 00:07:09.650
Why are they doing this?
But you know,
whatever.

99
00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:14.150
And then all of a sudden they had a,
the,
the group above us,

100
00:07:14.151 --> 00:07:19.100
the group that was in charge of the seals that were there,
um,

101
00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:23.150
it's called the CG soda.
If the Combined Joint Special Operations Task Force,

102
00:07:23.390 --> 00:07:24.320
that group,

103
00:07:25.070 --> 00:07:28.490
they hosted a halo tournaments,

104
00:07:29.890 --> 00:07:34.890
like in all the different special operations groups went and did this halo

105
00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:35.840
tournament.

106
00:07:36.650 --> 00:07:40.190
And I don't know if I'm proud of this or not proud of this,

107
00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:45.650
but two of my guys that entered the tournament,
they,
they compete,

108
00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:50.570
they won.
But not only did they want,
when,
I guess the way you play Halo you get,

109
00:07:50.870 --> 00:07:53.930
you can die multiple times.
And so after a certain number of times,

110
00:07:53.931 --> 00:07:57.650
like you play to a certain number of deaths I guess.
But anyways,
the,

111
00:07:57.651 --> 00:07:58.790
in the finals,

112
00:07:59.330 --> 00:08:03.770
these two guys beat the other guys that were from some army group or,

113
00:08:03.771 --> 00:08:07.490
or something.
They beat them 50 deaths to too.

114
00:08:09.020 --> 00:08:13.760
So I was just saying to myself,
really,
uh,
so many ways,

115
00:08:13.790 --> 00:08:16.840
uh,
the next deployment guys were playing some other,
I never,
I,

116
00:08:17.010 --> 00:08:20.570
I don't play video games,
but the other guys played in when we were in Ramadi,

117
00:08:20.571 --> 00:08:25.130
guys were playing,
I want to say John Madden football.
That's a good one.
Yeah.
See,

118
00:08:25.131 --> 00:08:29.360
I don't know cause I don't play video games,
the Echo Charles.
But uh,

119
00:08:29.450 --> 00:08:33.250
but what I was doing during those times,
during those downtimes is yes,
bring,
um,

120
00:08:33.410 --> 00:08:36.740
bring maths and train Jujitsu.
And there's always guys,

121
00:08:36.741 --> 00:08:38.900
even though there'd be plenty of guys playing video games and we'd,

122
00:08:38.990 --> 00:08:40.460
we'd trained Jujitsu for sure.

123
00:08:40.461 --> 00:08:45.060
And you should make time for it because you know what you think about,
um,

124
00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:47.240
being under a stressful situation.
Well,

125
00:08:47.241 --> 00:08:50.060
what's gonna help you with a stressful situation,
a physical outlet,

126
00:08:50.090 --> 00:08:52.850
a little mental break.
And guess what?

127
00:08:52.851 --> 00:08:54.980
Guess what gives you a physical outlet and gives you a mental break and doing

128
00:08:54.990 --> 00:08:56.700
some Jujitsu.
So,
you know,

129
00:08:56.701 --> 00:09:00.150
of course there's times where we'd go and we'd go in the field or we'd have

130
00:09:00.151 --> 00:09:02.870
multiple back to back to back to back operations and we won't build a train.

131
00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:07.560
No big deal.
Of course their job takes the total priority over it.
But um,

132
00:09:07.710 --> 00:09:11.400
yeah,
so I would always train and,
and I'll tell you one more thing.

133
00:09:12.630 --> 00:09:13.650
When I would go on deployment,

134
00:09:13.651 --> 00:09:17.190
like let's say you're a guy that trains and you go on deployment,

135
00:09:17.220 --> 00:09:20.010
well there's going to be somebody that will train with you even if there are

136
00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:23.220
never trained before somebody is going to go,
yeah,
I'll train with you.

137
00:09:23.790 --> 00:09:26.070
And those guys,
that's it.

138
00:09:26.071 --> 00:09:28.830
That happened to me where I went on deployment with a bunch of guys that didn't

139
00:09:28.831 --> 00:09:31.350
know anything and I just was teaching them.

140
00:09:31.350 --> 00:09:34.500
And when I came back from a six month deployment,
this is before the war.

141
00:09:34.950 --> 00:09:37.950
I was definitely way better than I was before I left.

142
00:09:37.951 --> 00:09:41.370
So even though I was only training with guys that were not even close to as good

143
00:09:41.371 --> 00:09:45.480
as me,
just training all the time and just going with guys,
you know,
strong,

144
00:09:45.481 --> 00:09:50.481
tough team guys made me better and when I got back I had improved a lot in

145
00:09:51.331 --> 00:09:54.310
comparison with the guys that I was training with before I left that will trade

146
00:09:54.311 --> 00:09:55.230
it all the time while I was gone.

147
00:09:55.231 --> 00:10:00.231
So you can make improvement even if you're just have bodies to move around and

148
00:10:00.931 --> 00:10:03.580
you can focus on your offense,
you can put yourself in bad positions.

149
00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:06.150
This isn't a bunch of ways to get better while you're doing it.
So yeah man,

150
00:10:06.151 --> 00:10:08.880
you can train,
you can train on deployment for sure.

151
00:10:09.030 --> 00:10:13.170
We just had a couple of guys come back from deployment from the Marine Corps and

152
00:10:13.220 --> 00:10:16.360
you know,
they were on a shipboard deployment.
They trained all the time,
you know,

153
00:10:16.361 --> 00:10:18.470
then just came back to victory in the and the,

154
00:10:18.550 --> 00:10:20.370
they've been training the whole time.
They got good too.

155
00:10:20.490 --> 00:10:24.060
They improve their game a lot.
Yeah,
I seen guys train,
I think it was army guys.

156
00:10:24.390 --> 00:10:26.940
They're training,
they train with the jacket on and they use the jacket.

157
00:10:27.930 --> 00:10:30.480
I mean different but kind of this,
oh yeah,
it's the same,
you know,

158
00:10:30.481 --> 00:10:34.710
and I've done that too.
Uh,
in fact the early days of Jujitsu for me,
I spent,

159
00:10:34.740 --> 00:10:36.900
that's why when know started getting popular,

160
00:10:37.500 --> 00:10:41.850
I kinda knew Nogi because we used to train in BDU pants,

161
00:10:41.851 --> 00:10:44.550
so like camouflage pants and a tee shirt that was sort of,

162
00:10:44.580 --> 00:10:47.640
that's sort of seemed like a good compromise.
And then,

163
00:10:48.030 --> 00:10:50.460
and plus dean and I trained no Gila even though Dean was,

164
00:10:50.490 --> 00:10:54.360
Dean was trained in Nogi cause he wrestled in and isn't he doing MMA stuff too

165
00:10:54.380 --> 00:10:58.150
then what he did,
he did know way before he did,
uh,

166
00:10:58.590 --> 00:11:00.990
before he did MMA.
I mean we are trading,
no,
Gee,

167
00:11:01.020 --> 00:11:03.240
I don't even know what our last dean,

168
00:11:03.270 --> 00:11:07.040
where the idea came because even in Samo you wear a jacket.
Right.

169
00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:12.900
And he was a Samba guy too.
Do you guys go like all when you train,
like,

170
00:11:12.901 --> 00:11:15.270
Hey,
I'm a,
you know,
I'm just one of the team guys.

171
00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:17.390
I don't train Jiu Jitsu and you're like,
hey,
let's go train.

172
00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:20.340
What did you do full on training?
Like six,

173
00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:24.990
eight minute rounds or it's the same thing.
I mean I've talked about before,

174
00:11:24.991 --> 00:11:27.150
like I would get guys that were training,

175
00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:30.150
even if they're a lower level and I'm just trained with all of them and just

176
00:11:30.151 --> 00:11:32.700
line them up and go and then they'd be trading with each other too,
you know?

177
00:11:32.701 --> 00:11:34.410
And I would teach little classes and say,
hey,

178
00:11:34.411 --> 00:11:37.140
this is how you do this and you know,
you,
you know me,

179
00:11:37.141 --> 00:11:41.010
I kind of liked a role more but so I would always end up rolling a lot.

180
00:11:41.610 --> 00:11:42.570
But you know,

181
00:11:42.630 --> 00:11:47.370
you get good tough team guys that wrestled or their high school or they did
judo.

182
00:11:47.371 --> 00:11:49.170
So there's guys and they always bring it,

183
00:11:49.171 --> 00:11:53.840
it's always good training and they're moving and they got great cardio and a

184
00:11:53.841 --> 00:11:58.000
strong,
and then,
you know,
anytime there was marines around or,
or soldiers around,

185
00:11:58.001 --> 00:11:59.320
there's some rangers down the street from me.

186
00:11:59.321 --> 00:12:02.350
I trained with a few of those guys a couple of times,
so yeah,
man,

187
00:12:02.590 --> 00:12:04.120
getting after it.
You can definitely,

188
00:12:04.210 --> 00:12:06.670
you got to find a way to do it and then you make time to do it.

189
00:12:08.930 --> 00:12:09.763
<v 2>Next question.</v>

190
00:12:10.970 --> 00:12:15.970
My boss instituted mandatory uncompensated monthly meetings with the added

191
00:12:17.601 --> 00:12:21.380
warning that if we miss them there'd be repercussions.

192
00:12:22.430 --> 00:12:25.130
Well,
this is an unjust move on his part.

193
00:12:25.131 --> 00:12:27.410
I'm choosing to remain silent and not complain.

194
00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:29.930
I decided that this is not enough of a,

195
00:12:29.931 --> 00:12:33.590
of a pressing issue for me to speak out against that when the next time I

196
00:12:33.591 --> 00:12:38.210
decided to actually raise an issue over something,
it'll have more of an impact.

197
00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:43.280
This was influenced by your decision to only ask for or ask your leadership for

198
00:12:43.281 --> 00:12:46.610
help only when absolutely necessary because of this.

199
00:12:46.611 --> 00:12:50.090
When you did ask for something,
you request was taken much more seriously.

200
00:12:50.930 --> 00:12:55.040
Do you think this was the right way to lead up the chain of command in this

201
00:12:55.041 --> 00:12:56.990
scenario?
Yeah.

202
00:12:57.210 --> 00:12:59.730
<v 0>I think that's all very good way to lead up the chain of command in that</v>

203
00:12:59.731 --> 00:13:00.330
scenario,

204
00:13:00.330 --> 00:13:05.330
and you got to choose your battles because it is possible in any job to to cry

205
00:13:06.421 --> 00:13:10.380
wolf,
right?
It's possible to say,
oh,
well this is this way.
We can't do this.

206
00:13:10.381 --> 00:13:12.510
And it's,
it's possible if you complain about everything,

207
00:13:12.511 --> 00:13:15.870
eventually you're not getting listened to any more.
So what I would do here,

208
00:13:16.230 --> 00:13:18.810
definitely attend the meetings,
right?
You show up for the meetings,

209
00:13:18.811 --> 00:13:21.150
you tend the meetings,
you see what they're about to see,
what the deal is,

210
00:13:21.390 --> 00:13:23.070
what is he trying to accomplish?

211
00:13:23.100 --> 00:13:25.500
Maybe he has some really good thing that he's trying to accomplish.

212
00:13:25.501 --> 00:13:27.360
Got To put out word or we don't know yet.

213
00:13:27.510 --> 00:13:30.600
Maybe his vision is that this only going to only gonna hold these mandatory

214
00:13:30.601 --> 00:13:33.240
meetings until he gets a flow and it gets everybody on board and then he can go,

215
00:13:33.241 --> 00:13:35.130
cool,
we don't have to do this anymore.
You guys got it.

216
00:13:35.490 --> 00:13:37.890
I don't know what his vision is.
Your,
no,
what's he trying to make happen?

217
00:13:38.070 --> 00:13:41.670
Let's give him that credit as the leader to say,
hey,
you know,

218
00:13:41.671 --> 00:13:43.170
you're calling this meeting,
we're going to show up there,

219
00:13:43.171 --> 00:13:46.370
we're going to do our best to participate and,

220
00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:50.850
and get the most out of the meeting.
Find out what it's all about.

221
00:13:50.851 --> 00:13:53.080
So go to the meetings and then now you got your guys.

222
00:13:53.081 --> 00:13:56.550
So you're might be a little bit worried about your guys' right.
Saying,
hey,

223
00:13:56.551 --> 00:14:00.900
why are you making us a dentist meeting that the said we got to go to and on

224
00:14:00.901 --> 00:14:01.734
that one,

225
00:14:02.220 --> 00:14:06.210
what I would likely do is make everyone attended a few of them and I would do
it.

226
00:14:06.211 --> 00:14:08.400
So hey guys,
the boss is having a meeting.
No,
we're not going to get paid,

227
00:14:08.401 --> 00:14:10.620
but look,
we're going to get word where to find out what's going on.

228
00:14:10.620 --> 00:14:12.720
So I want everyone's,
everyone's got to be there,
right?

229
00:14:12.721 --> 00:14:17.040
So you don't pass the buck,
you,
you,
you maintain the,

230
00:14:17.220 --> 00:14:21.750
the responsibility of what's happening.
You own it.
And then maybe,

231
00:14:21.780 --> 00:14:25.290
maybe after a little while though,
you look at the Boston,
he said,
hey boss,

232
00:14:25.620 --> 00:14:27.420
you know what?
These meetings are good to go.

233
00:14:27.421 --> 00:14:29.130
I'm getting a lot out of them but I'm not going to make my,

234
00:14:29.131 --> 00:14:32.130
I don't want to make my guys go,
I want to pass the word to them.

235
00:14:32.131 --> 00:14:35.220
So is that all right if I have them skip the meetings but I'll be there and then

236
00:14:35.221 --> 00:14:38.970
I'll put out the information and you know,
most likely you'll get a,

237
00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:39.950
hey that sounds good.

238
00:14:40.020 --> 00:14:44.280
Es specially if you've been attending the meetings and you've been
participating,

239
00:14:44.281 --> 00:14:47.010
you've been raising your hand and saying taking notes and saying yeah we got

240
00:14:47.011 --> 00:14:51.680
that boss.
We can make that happen if you've been,
is that kissing ass?
No,
no,
no.

241
00:14:51.710 --> 00:14:54.260
It's building relationship right now.

242
00:14:54.470 --> 00:14:59.470
There is a distinction right between kissing ass and building relationship and

243
00:14:59.840 --> 00:15:03.110
don't kiss ass because you're not building a relationship when you kiss ass.

244
00:15:03.111 --> 00:15:05.420
As a matter of fact,
people are turned off by it.

245
00:15:05.570 --> 00:15:09.260
So you don't want to be that guy.
Hey boss,
what a wonderful meeting.

246
00:15:09.470 --> 00:15:12.860
I got so much out of it.
No,
no,
no,
no,
no.
Put participate and get in the game.

247
00:15:12.890 --> 00:15:13.580
That's all I'm saying.

248
00:15:13.580 --> 00:15:16.170
I'm not saying cause ask cause cause ass isn't going to get you.
It's gonna.

249
00:15:16.190 --> 00:15:20.330
It's gonna look bad.
I mean,
are there some bosses that that feed off of that?

250
00:15:20.331 --> 00:15:23.840
Yes there are and well you gotta you might have to play that game a little bit.

251
00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:25.970
You might have to play the game loop,
not going to feel good.

252
00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:27.440
That's why we have to put our ego in check

253
00:15:29.030 --> 00:15:33.680
and then yeah,
that's what I would do.
So I think you made the right call.

254
00:15:33.860 --> 00:15:36.200
Let's get an go to go to a bunch of these meetings,

255
00:15:36.201 --> 00:15:39.320
see what they're all about and maybe you know,
eventually you're saying,
hey boss,

256
00:15:39.321 --> 00:15:40.640
you know,
these are uncompensated.

257
00:15:40.641 --> 00:15:45.320
We could probably utilize these hours better if we did some this or we did that.

258
00:15:45.530 --> 00:15:48.920
So this is good,
good straight forward method.

259
00:15:49.100 --> 00:15:52.870
I think you made the right call and let us know how it goes.
Yeah,
yeah.

260
00:15:52.880 --> 00:15:56.690
The casinos thing,
everyone knows you're kissing ass and everyone does.

261
00:15:57.220 --> 00:16:01.250
I mean really what you're doing is you're trading your longterm respect.

262
00:16:01.251 --> 00:16:06.251
You're trading that in for that short term popularity with just the boss by the

263
00:16:06.441 --> 00:16:09.950
way,
like all your people,
because your popularity is going down.

264
00:16:10.250 --> 00:16:13.340
Everyone's looking at you like,
look at that guy cause he nas,
look at them.

265
00:16:13.341 --> 00:16:15.170
Even the boss,
even if he likes it,

266
00:16:15.590 --> 00:16:17.800
there's a big part of his brain like all right,

267
00:16:18.360 --> 00:16:21.400
so that's what I'm saying that you don't have to kiss ass right?

268
00:16:21.560 --> 00:16:24.650
You don't have to kiss ass.
But you know what you,
what does the boss want?

269
00:16:24.651 --> 00:16:26.630
Someone that's kissing their ass and saying,
wow,
what a wonderful idea.

270
00:16:26.660 --> 00:16:29.060
Or someone that's actively participate in like a professional,
you know,

271
00:16:29.150 --> 00:16:32.120
that's what they want.
That's what they want to do.

272
00:16:32.121 --> 00:16:34.460
That gotta be done for the cause because they're like,
Dang,

273
00:16:34.461 --> 00:16:37.690
I'm done for the cause.
I'll tell you when I have a problem with something,

274
00:16:37.700 --> 00:16:38.990
I'll tell you why.
You know,
that kind of thing.

275
00:16:38.991 --> 00:16:40.610
But ultimately if you're down for the cause,

276
00:16:40.611 --> 00:16:43.490
your bosses cause heard the whole cause or whatever.
Um,

277
00:16:43.900 --> 00:16:48.900
that's so much of it changes with your attitude if you're to attitude is like,

278
00:16:49.670 --> 00:16:54.490
Oh man,
this is bull.
But if you're on,
she's like,
hey,
this is really cool at the,

279
00:16:54.630 --> 00:16:57.200
that the boss is stepping up.
He's trying to get us engaged in this.

280
00:16:57.290 --> 00:16:58.460
I'm going to go in there and get after it.

281
00:16:58.920 --> 00:17:00.740
That just totally changed your attitude right there.

282
00:17:00.830 --> 00:17:03.110
And I've done that a million times,
played that little game in my head.
Said,

283
00:17:03.111 --> 00:17:06.380
all right,
my boss is an idiot and you know what?
I'm an idiot.
Let's go.

284
00:17:06.381 --> 00:17:08.800
Let's make this happen.
I'm gonna,
I'm gonna get after it.
What is,

285
00:17:08.801 --> 00:17:11.180
what stupid things is going to tell me you don't want to do with that stupid

286
00:17:11.181 --> 00:17:13.160
thing he tells me to do.
I'm going to crush it.

287
00:17:13.460 --> 00:17:15.650
I did that at when I was going to officer candidate school.

288
00:17:16.850 --> 00:17:20.570
And there's this thing at officer candidate school where you have to yell

289
00:17:20.600 --> 00:17:23.510
everything that you say.
They call it bean ballistic.

290
00:17:23.540 --> 00:17:26.720
They say you gotta be ballistic at all times and it's pretty cool why they do
it.

291
00:17:26.721 --> 00:17:30.200
Actually they do it because you get some people that are coming in in the

292
00:17:30.201 --> 00:17:31.310
military cause when you go to ocs,

293
00:17:31.340 --> 00:17:33.920
most of the people that are going through ocs with have never been in the

294
00:17:33.921 --> 00:17:34.550
military before.

295
00:17:34.550 --> 00:17:37.070
They're coming from college and they graduated college and now they're going to

296
00:17:37.071 --> 00:17:39.260
ocs.
So they've got 13 weeks to get turned into an officer.

297
00:17:39.650 --> 00:17:44.600
So what they do is they make you yell everything.
Why do they do that?

298
00:17:44.601 --> 00:17:47.840
The reason they make you yell everything is cause there's some people that

299
00:17:47.841 --> 00:17:49.250
aren't confident when they speak.

300
00:17:49.770 --> 00:17:52.680
And so everything that they're gonna say there can be shy about saying it.

301
00:17:52.681 --> 00:17:56.520
Well at ocs you've actually got to yell everything that you say because you

302
00:17:56.521 --> 00:18:01.410
can't go on the bridge of a ship and say,
uh,
can,
can we turn the shift?
You know,

303
00:18:01.411 --> 00:18:04.890
90 degrees to the port?
No,
no,
no.
You have to speak up.
You have to say,
Hey,

304
00:18:05.070 --> 00:18:06.360
we're turning 90 degrees pork.

305
00:18:06.420 --> 00:18:09.240
I don't actually know what the command is cause I wasn't as a surface warfare

306
00:18:09.241 --> 00:18:12.180
officer.
But you know,
you say,
hey,
we're going to turn 90 degrees port.

307
00:18:12.210 --> 00:18:13.920
You can't say it in a timid way.

308
00:18:14.100 --> 00:18:17.790
And so the way they beat that out of used by making you yell every single thing

309
00:18:17.791 --> 00:18:19.560
that you do when you're an officer candidate school.

310
00:18:19.650 --> 00:18:24.650
So what what we did was the upperclassmen that control you when you're going

311
00:18:25.471 --> 00:18:25.741
through,

312
00:18:25.741 --> 00:18:28.920
there's like a class that's getting ready to graduate and they kind of control

313
00:18:28.921 --> 00:18:30.630
you when the drill instructors aren't there.

314
00:18:31.230 --> 00:18:34.110
And so they also make a little money for their fund.

315
00:18:34.710 --> 00:18:37.830
And the way they make money for the Fund is selling Soda and Candy and this

316
00:18:37.831 --> 00:18:41.640
little,
this little closet,
right?
I mean it's,
it's,
it's authorized.

317
00:18:42.390 --> 00:18:46.020
So my class,
I said,
hey guys,

318
00:18:46.500 --> 00:18:50.870
when you go into,
I was the class president w as in can you go?
I said,

319
00:18:50.871 --> 00:18:55.871
where do you go into the Office to Buy Candy or soda?

320
00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:00.240
Which I don't recommend,
but if you do,
if you do,
do it,

321
00:19:00.660 --> 00:19:03.900
go in there and be ballistic.
They were like,

322
00:19:03.910 --> 00:19:05.790
why to go do it because those are the rules.

323
00:19:06.270 --> 00:19:09.810
And so everyone lined up and they went in this little closet and they're yelling

324
00:19:09.811 --> 00:19:13.230
at them.
I would lock on Coca Cola and watch snickers bar.

325
00:19:14.220 --> 00:19:18.420
And after 10 people,
the person that's in there,

326
00:19:18.421 --> 00:19:19.740
the upperclassmen comes out and goes,

327
00:19:19.830 --> 00:19:22.530
you guys are no longer allowed to be ballistic.

328
00:19:22.860 --> 00:19:26.430
And that was the way that we want.
No,
just get it.

329
00:19:26.431 --> 00:19:30.180
I actually did that in bud's to where I'd do stuff to the,

330
00:19:30.630 --> 00:19:32.130
to the extreme,
you know,

331
00:19:32.280 --> 00:19:36.510
like you got to get wet and sandy and buds and which means you got to get jumped

332
00:19:36.511 --> 00:19:40.800
in the ocean,
then roll around in the sand.
Well,
I would jump in the ocean.

333
00:19:40.980 --> 00:19:44.040
I would roll around in the sand and then when you get back to the instructor

334
00:19:44.041 --> 00:19:46.920
that told you to go get wet and Sandy,
you'd have to go back to them and say,

335
00:19:47.010 --> 00:19:48.810
who your instructor Charles,

336
00:19:48.811 --> 00:19:50.820
to make sure that they knew that you got wet and Sandy.

337
00:19:51.120 --> 00:19:53.520
So what I would do is I'd go,
I didn't do it immediately,

338
00:19:53.521 --> 00:19:56.940
but I don't want to figure it out that I could do this.
I did it.
I would go,

339
00:19:56.970 --> 00:19:59.700
I would get wet.
I would get sandy out completely.

340
00:19:59.970 --> 00:20:04.140
I would completely cover my every square inch of my body with sand.

341
00:20:04.530 --> 00:20:08.900
And then I would put sand into my mouth.
I would feel myself,

342
00:20:09.120 --> 00:20:13.590
my mouth is sand and when I'd run up to say who Yada the instructor,

343
00:20:13.591 --> 00:20:18.120
when I'd say who yacht dry sand or come out of my mouth,
it was uh,

344
00:20:18.450 --> 00:20:21.030
it was pretty fun.
So I like to have that attitude like,
oh,

345
00:20:21.031 --> 00:20:24.780
you want to make me do something great,
I'll do it and I'm going to do it with,

346
00:20:24.930 --> 00:20:28.290
with vigor and enthusiasm.
And,

347
00:20:28.440 --> 00:20:30.780
and then we literally in my,

348
00:20:30.781 --> 00:20:35.781
in my buds class when at a certain point they told us we weren't allowed to get

349
00:20:36.301 --> 00:20:40.470
wet and sandy anymore.
They,
they literally told us that.
And uh,
they said no,

350
00:20:41.120 --> 00:20:44.730
you weren't allowed to get wet anymore.
And we were saying what's wrong?

351
00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:48.610
There's no,
you're not allowed on that.
So it actually,
yeah.
Okay,

352
00:20:48.760 --> 00:20:51.130
well headed anyways.
It's kind of like they're,

353
00:20:51.700 --> 00:20:54.940
they're like kind of push pushing you down this hill with insect pest

354
00:20:54.970 --> 00:20:58.820
expectation that you're going to be putting on the brakes to the fire.
Yeah.

355
00:20:59.020 --> 00:21:01.060
So like the more they push it down the hill,

356
00:21:01.061 --> 00:21:05.110
the more your natural tendency hopefully is going to be to put on the brakes.

357
00:21:05.111 --> 00:21:08.470
That's why all that works,
you know,
like,
oh go get wet and said,
aw,
that sucks.

358
00:21:08.590 --> 00:21:11.830
But if you're like,
when sandy time was do this kind of thing,
then it's like,
ah.

359
00:21:11.890 --> 00:21:15.340
And then you,
in a way you can put on the brakes when they say stop and like,

360
00:21:15.350 --> 00:21:19.690
okay,
we want,
I'm going to get witness.
One of my buddies,
we,

361
00:21:20.230 --> 00:21:23.860
so there's something called flights where you run up this hill and you carry

362
00:21:24.460 --> 00:21:26.800
pallets.
You know what a pallet is right there.
I don't know.

363
00:21:26.810 --> 00:21:29.530
They're made of wood or steel.
We had both there.

364
00:21:29.710 --> 00:21:31.960
They call them flights and they actually have a little flight tower.

365
00:21:32.980 --> 00:21:35.720
Just a little drill is called,
it's called flights.

366
00:21:35.721 --> 00:21:37.110
And you put this thing on your back.

367
00:21:37.111 --> 00:21:40.210
So you look like an airplane and you run up this hill and come back down and you

368
00:21:40.211 --> 00:21:43.720
do it as a squad.
And when he'd get back to the,
the bottom,
they'd say,
okay,

369
00:21:43.721 --> 00:21:47.100
who came in last place?
Wait,
how many Kapow let one guy,
one pallet.
Yeah,

370
00:21:47.110 --> 00:21:51.100
one guy per pallet.
And it'd be like,
who?
Okay.
Who came in last place and I'd say,

371
00:21:51.430 --> 00:21:53.950
I came here and then you got to do it again.

372
00:21:54.310 --> 00:21:57.130
But the funniest was when you came back down,

373
00:21:57.940 --> 00:22:00.760
if you were slow or they just wanted to hammer you more than they'd say,
Hey,

374
00:22:00.761 --> 00:22:03.580
you're on fire,
go,
go put it out in.

375
00:22:03.580 --> 00:22:08.080
Which means you got to run then your pallet down to the ocean.
And so,

376
00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:12.970
so one time I came back down and well one time I came back down and I said,

377
00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:15.280
they said you'd have to request permission to land.

378
00:22:15.370 --> 00:22:20.110
And one time I came back down and said,
uh,
I can't land them on fire.
And they go,

379
00:22:20.500 --> 00:22:22.140
okay,
go take a look at the surf.

380
00:22:22.630 --> 00:22:26.140
But what was even better than that was a couple of days later I came back down,

381
00:22:26.141 --> 00:22:30.670
I said,
request permission to touch and go,
which highlights is,
you know,
you,

382
00:22:30.730 --> 00:22:34.900
you land in,
then you take right back off.
So I just,
they go permission.
Granted

383
00:22:36.650 --> 00:22:40.660
it's pretty funny,
isn't it?
Doesn't that cause basically the,

384
00:22:40.661 --> 00:22:45.100
that starts with just embracing the attitude starts with I have a good time with

385
00:22:45.101 --> 00:22:48.970
it.
It doesn't it result in all this crap.
Let's face it.
Men that go get wet.

386
00:22:48.970 --> 00:22:53.890
And Sandy,
I mean from a normal standpoint is allegedly not fun.
So fun.

387
00:22:54.070 --> 00:22:55.390
Neither is the flight bro.

388
00:22:55.391 --> 00:22:59.560
You explained that the flights is not cool but doing it that way it's just as

389
00:22:59.561 --> 00:23:03.070
hard kind of physically.
But it's a little bit the experience,

390
00:23:05.870 --> 00:23:09.370
our terms a little bit harder.
Big spirits is way better though.

391
00:23:10.350 --> 00:23:13.330
And then yeah we put,
we always had a good time when we were doing,

392
00:23:13.331 --> 00:23:17.110
like we used to go on when you're on a ship then you go and the ship do

393
00:23:17.111 --> 00:23:20.230
something called an unwrapped where you,
they load geared,

394
00:23:20.231 --> 00:23:25.231
they load food and supplies and fuel from another ship and we would go help but

395
00:23:25.781 --> 00:23:27.950
we would turn it into like a sport or whatever.

396
00:23:28.010 --> 00:23:30.190
Tried to move as much boxes as we can.

397
00:23:30.191 --> 00:23:34.100
And guys we're all sweating and just getting after it.
And instead of being is,

398
00:23:34.120 --> 00:23:37.690
it'd be in,
cause it's,
it's,
it's whatever.
It's sucks,
right?

399
00:23:37.691 --> 00:23:39.100
Cause you gotta go up there and move a bunch of boxes,

400
00:23:39.101 --> 00:23:43.100
like a moving party basically.
But we actually turn it into a moving party.

401
00:23:43.160 --> 00:23:46.730
Emphasis on party.
We would go out to have fun,
be laughing,
throwing stuff,

402
00:23:46.970 --> 00:23:49.970
and just basically getting after it

403
00:23:50.970 --> 00:23:55.830
<v 3>labor,
but why not have a good time?
Oh,
that's a good idea.
You got to,</v>

404
00:23:55.831 --> 00:23:58.820
you got to really man up with it for sure.
But once you,

405
00:23:58.830 --> 00:24:03.600
if you can kind of flip that switch,
but that's good.
Yeah,
it changes everything.

406
00:24:04.170 --> 00:24:08.010
When you get that good attitude going,
make it fun.
It's good.

407
00:24:08.011 --> 00:24:10.620
Then those pallets.
Yeah,

408
00:24:10.621 --> 00:24:14.550
flights we waste or we do on quiet Poli.
Holly,

409
00:24:14.580 --> 00:24:18.240
huge beach sand,
you know,
to get to the beach.

410
00:24:18.900 --> 00:24:23.880
Seven Mile Beach,
by the way.
Nice.
Make bonfires with those pallets.
Oh yeah.
Yeah.

411
00:24:24.210 --> 00:24:27.880
You can carry them up.
You're back on the truck.
I for sure.

412
00:24:30.030 --> 00:24:31.490
Next question.
Let's do it.

413
00:24:32.230 --> 00:24:35.970
Do you have any recommendations for careers that are similar to the military and

414
00:24:35.971 --> 00:24:40.320
or careers that are based on leadership context here?
The context.

415
00:24:40.930 --> 00:24:45.930
I applied to the Canadian armed forces to be a signals officer and I failed my

416
00:24:46.381 --> 00:24:48.630
medical signals officer.
You know what that is?
Yeah.

417
00:24:48.880 --> 00:24:52.470
It's basically a communications officer.
Right,
right there.
Okay.
So yeah,

418
00:24:52.500 --> 00:24:54.360
currently looking for alternatives.

419
00:24:56.570 --> 00:24:59.630
<v 0>Well,
I,
I'm not sure what the physical shortfall is.</v>

420
00:24:59.631 --> 00:25:02.990
I'm going to assume that the physical shortfall was something that was

421
00:25:04.100 --> 00:25:07.460
disqualified you from any type of millage.

422
00:25:07.461 --> 00:25:09.110
So maybe you have really bad vision.

423
00:25:09.111 --> 00:25:11.070
Maybe you have really bad hearing it in here.

424
00:25:11.120 --> 00:25:12.980
Maybe you have some irregular heart thing.

425
00:25:13.520 --> 00:25:17.030
Maybe there's just some blood typed,
you know,
did something,

426
00:25:17.070 --> 00:25:21.560
there's a bunch of things that can do that to people and so I'm going to assume

427
00:25:21.561 --> 00:25:25.160
that it was bad enough that you can't join the military at all.
Okay.

428
00:25:25.310 --> 00:25:28.440
The next thing is,
can you get into some kind of police or law enforcement that,

429
00:25:28.470 --> 00:25:32.480
that's the next question because maybe there's something that disqualifies you

430
00:25:32.481 --> 00:25:33.890
from the,
from the military,

431
00:25:33.891 --> 00:25:38.270
but you could still get into police and law enforcement.
And by the way,

432
00:25:39.200 --> 00:25:41.630
if you can't get into that,
what kind of,

433
00:25:42.020 --> 00:25:47.020
maybe some kind of an anti-terror agency that you could possibly go into.

434
00:25:48.440 --> 00:25:52.340
And I would say the next step from there is,
you know,

435
00:25:52.610 --> 00:25:55.100
what kind of an intelligence agency could go walk for,
you know,

436
00:25:55.101 --> 00:25:56.300
what kind of a purse,
you know,

437
00:25:56.820 --> 00:26:01.820
it could you be a person that learns a language that learns some technical

438
00:26:02.331 --> 00:26:06.350
skills that allows you to pursue people through the interwebs.
You know,

439
00:26:06.351 --> 00:26:10.340
there's a lot of terror happening on the interwebs and it needs to be stopped.

440
00:26:10.341 --> 00:26:14.570
So who's doing that?
Cyber war.
Cyber wars real.
I mean it's,
it's real.

441
00:26:14.840 --> 00:26:17.240
So is there something that you could presume there?
And guess what?

442
00:26:17.540 --> 00:26:21.410
You're doing it,
you're doing it virtually,
right?

443
00:26:21.440 --> 00:26:23.180
But you're still hunting down terrorists and,

444
00:26:23.210 --> 00:26:27.890
and catching bad guys and preventing terror attacks.
So even though it's not,

445
00:26:28.310 --> 00:26:32.780
you know,
shooting a machine gun,
it's still is a,
he has a huge impact.

446
00:26:32.990 --> 00:26:34.580
And I'll tell you what,
in future,
in the future,

447
00:26:34.581 --> 00:26:37.670
it might even have a bigger impact than the guys that are shooters.

448
00:26:38.270 --> 00:26:43.030
So there's that,
there's that avenue to look at.
And same thing in,

449
00:26:43.080 --> 00:26:44.850
in,
in law enforcement,

450
00:26:44.870 --> 00:26:47.550
there are certain professions that you can get where you're not actually a

451
00:26:47.551 --> 00:26:52.170
police officer,
but you're a a,
you know,
a forensic,

452
00:26:52.660 --> 00:26:55.590
a forensic scientist that goes and looks at crime scenes and tries to figure out

453
00:26:55.591 --> 00:26:59.410
what happens.
So there's definitely some,
some,
uh,

454
00:26:59.550 --> 00:27:01.860
roads to go down there.
Then there's fire fighting.

455
00:27:01.861 --> 00:27:05.040
Of course there's been a paramedic.
That's another good one.

456
00:27:05.041 --> 00:27:09.810
Those are all all service based.
And so that's like a whole group,

457
00:27:09.811 --> 00:27:11.970
right?
That's a whole thing.
Yeah.

458
00:27:12.540 --> 00:27:16.900
And then let's say you can't do any of those things will,

459
00:27:16.970 --> 00:27:20.730
will then what?
Well for me it's really easy.

460
00:27:22.320 --> 00:27:23.153
<v 1>Construction</v>

461
00:27:24.110 --> 00:27:28.550
<v 0>software engineering,
being a salesperson,
going into technology,</v>

462
00:27:28.820 --> 00:27:32.220
being a plumber,
being an electrician,
going into automotive,

463
00:27:32.221 --> 00:27:35.090
a prayer or automotive repair.
What?

464
00:27:35.330 --> 00:27:39.740
Like what all those jobs,
if you are getting after those jobs,

465
00:27:40.070 --> 00:27:43.340
they're all you can,
you can excel,
you can own your own company,

466
00:27:43.341 --> 00:27:46.970
you can get after it,
you can lead,
you can make a ton of money.

467
00:27:47.040 --> 00:27:49.100
Any one of those jobs,
you can make a ton of money.
Any of them.

468
00:27:49.790 --> 00:27:54.410
If you are a professional and you take pride in your work and you make,

469
00:27:54.470 --> 00:27:57.740
I saw something the other day,
I wish I could find it.
I try and post again,

470
00:27:58.160 --> 00:27:59.180
it was just a,

471
00:27:59.260 --> 00:28:04.260
a plumber had obviously done this massive job where all these pipes were all

472
00:28:06.111 --> 00:28:09.950
coming and going into one thing.
And,
and there was,
you know,

473
00:28:10.010 --> 00:28:13.310
probably 20 or 30 little pieces of pipe,

474
00:28:13.790 --> 00:28:17.990
but they were all perfectly aligned,
perfectly exact in,

475
00:28:18.010 --> 00:28:21.950
and it was in some,
you know,
storage,
you know,
a mechanical room.

476
00:28:22.160 --> 00:28:26.990
But it just looked like so professional.
And that's the kind of thing that,

477
00:28:27.150 --> 00:28:29.930
you know,
no matter what your job is,
what are you gonna do?

478
00:28:30.590 --> 00:28:34.850
Are you e all you need to do is step up and get after it.

479
00:28:34.851 --> 00:28:35.900
And all those jobs,

480
00:28:35.901 --> 00:28:39.620
any job that you're doing that your work that you enjoy and you know,

481
00:28:39.621 --> 00:28:43.280
do something that you enjoy and what makes you enjoy things.
To me,

482
00:28:43.281 --> 00:28:44.114
what makes you enjoy,

483
00:28:44.420 --> 00:28:48.920
enjoy things is doing well and practicing and getting good at them and having

484
00:28:48.921 --> 00:28:53.690
pride in your work.
That's awesome.
So I would say,
you know,

485
00:28:53.691 --> 00:28:56.780
you gotta go,
you gotta find something that you like doing and

486
00:28:58.640 --> 00:29:02.360
<v 1>get after it.
You know,
lot of times</v>

487
00:29:03.550 --> 00:29:06.400
<v 2>just in general as far as finding what you want to do.</v>

488
00:29:08.200 --> 00:29:09.033
<v 1>Okay.</v>

489
00:29:09.050 --> 00:29:10.910
<v 2>You know,
sometimes people like,
Hey,
I like to,</v>

490
00:29:11.090 --> 00:29:14.990
I dunno surf so I'm gonna go be a surf instructor or something like that.

491
00:29:16.010 --> 00:29:21.010
Usually how to find what you want to do doesn't have to do directly.

492
00:29:21.981 --> 00:29:26.660
It's like what are the things that that stimulate you or motivate you or

493
00:29:26.661 --> 00:29:31.370
whatever that that make you like surfing or make you like whatever.
It's like.

494
00:29:31.520 --> 00:29:33.170
So a lot of it is real like basics.

495
00:29:33.171 --> 00:29:36.620
Like I like problem solving this way or something like that.

496
00:29:37.130 --> 00:29:42.010
So tip there is,
look at what you like to or

497
00:29:42.010 --> 00:29:44.080
<v 0>like what you like.
Don't watch on forensic or whatever.</v>

498
00:29:44.140 --> 00:29:47.680
I like to work with my hands.
Okay,
good.
Then you need to be a carpenter.

499
00:29:47.681 --> 00:29:49.830
You need to be a plumber,
you need to be electrician.
Oh,

500
00:29:49.840 --> 00:29:54.220
I like to work with my brain.
Okay,
you like to solve problems.
Okay.

501
00:29:54.221 --> 00:29:56.920
Become a software engineer where you're trying to figure out how to map all

502
00:29:56.921 --> 00:30:00.110
those things together or a status.
Tisha,
I liked the numbers.
I'm gonna be a stat.

503
00:30:00.250 --> 00:30:02.890
So yes,
absolutely.
What are you interested?

504
00:30:02.950 --> 00:30:07.090
And then what job requires that type of mindset and skill?

505
00:30:07.390 --> 00:30:11.440
Because it's always fun cause I work with so many different companies in every

506
00:30:11.441 --> 00:30:15.880
different industry and whenever I meet,
you know,
there's always a,

507
00:30:16.030 --> 00:30:19.720
a group of people that are just into their job,
right?

508
00:30:19.721 --> 00:30:23.380
They're into it and they want to be the best and it,

509
00:30:23.680 --> 00:30:26.860
and it doesn't matter what it is.
And I've,
I've had,
you know,

510
00:30:26.861 --> 00:30:27.760
I worked with companies,

511
00:30:27.880 --> 00:30:30.970
every different industry and sometimes I think to myself,

512
00:30:32.110 --> 00:30:34.570
well this is a weird industry to kind of,
I kind of,
you know,

513
00:30:34.571 --> 00:30:38.020
just think it's weird that I'm going to work with this particular company

514
00:30:38.021 --> 00:30:39.070
because this is a weird industry.

515
00:30:39.340 --> 00:30:43.810
And then I meet the person that's bringing me in and they're talking to me about

516
00:30:43.811 --> 00:30:46.710
their business.
Like they're going into combat.
Yeah.
Amy.

517
00:30:46.730 --> 00:30:48.970
And I mean that in the most positive way.
They're like,
Hey,

518
00:30:48.971 --> 00:30:51.000
this is what we want to do.
This is our vision right here,
this.

519
00:30:51.040 --> 00:30:55.210
And they're talking about,
you know,
selling shampoo.
I mean,
you know what I mean?

520
00:30:55.211 --> 00:30:58.860
Like just some thing that they're,

521
00:30:58.870 --> 00:31:02.100
that they're into and they just want to do the best that they can at it.

522
00:31:02.110 --> 00:31:06.310
And that becomes a,
a passionate and a fuel.
So it's,
it's,

523
00:31:06.340 --> 00:31:10.720
it's fun to watch,
it's fun to watch and it doesn't,
and it translates,
you know,

524
00:31:10.721 --> 00:31:13.030
the attitude that they bring to it and the leadership that they bring to it

525
00:31:13.031 --> 00:31:16.140
translates into their whole life.
That's how well,

526
00:31:16.150 --> 00:31:19.960
that's what makes people successful in business in life is when there they bring

527
00:31:19.961 --> 00:31:21.100
that attitude of I'm going to,

528
00:31:21.340 --> 00:31:25.510
I'm going to do this the best of my ability and I'm gonna grow and we get
better.

529
00:31:25.540 --> 00:31:27.520
And I'm a find my weaknesses and I'm gonna work on those.

530
00:31:27.521 --> 00:31:28.241
And the next thing you know,

531
00:31:28.241 --> 00:31:31.270
these people owning their own businesses and it's awesome.

532
00:31:31.820 --> 00:31:36.430
<v 3>No.
Next question,</v>

533
00:31:36.850 --> 00:31:37.683
let's do that.

534
00:31:39.520 --> 00:31:43.350
Why do you never or rarely swear or for,

535
00:31:44.740 --> 00:31:49.060
well,
I did.
He never spend,
anyway,
that's part a of the question.

536
00:31:49.061 --> 00:31:50.380
Why do you never swear or used profanity?

537
00:31:50.770 --> 00:31:55.770
B Part B of the question is what do you do to combat burnout?

538
00:31:57.080 --> 00:31:59.920
This,
my schedule isn't helping.
I'm a prosecutor,

539
00:31:59.921 --> 00:32:04.921
constantly overrun with violence and despair up up at 5:00 AM to play music or

540
00:32:05.711 --> 00:32:10.160
read that you did to purple belt.
Trying to keep up with the monster,

541
00:32:10.170 --> 00:32:14.830
the young monsters on the mat but never seemed to have enough time because life

542
00:32:14.831 --> 00:32:19.831
is always making huge demands and trying to get better at gymnastic strength

543
00:32:20.410 --> 00:32:25.000
training without neglecting my wife and my dog.
Thanks for encouraging us.

544
00:32:25.010 --> 00:32:29.470
Regular photos deep.
Dig a little deeper and try a little harder.
Well

545
00:32:31.230 --> 00:32:32.160
<v 0>the swearing question,</v>

546
00:32:32.161 --> 00:32:34.710
we actually talked about that already on one of the earlier podcasts.

547
00:32:34.740 --> 00:32:39.210
I don't know which number.
Yeah,
but it's covered in great detail.

548
00:32:39.230 --> 00:32:42.440
I think it's an 18 minute conversation.
Let's not rehash that one.

549
00:32:42.520 --> 00:32:46.610
And just to clarify,
clarify that a more appropriate.

550
00:32:46.710 --> 00:32:50.000
We'll just say the question would be to modify to say why do you never or rarely

551
00:32:50.001 --> 00:32:52.700
swear on while you're recording?

552
00:32:53.090 --> 00:32:56.260
That is true cause you get your swear on from time to time I,

553
00:32:56.290 --> 00:32:57.800
well no I have used,

554
00:32:57.801 --> 00:33:02.801
I give myself a six foul language usages per month doing outside,

555
00:33:04.480 --> 00:33:08.840
you know,
outside recording.
Yeah.
No,
I'm just kidding.
I do swear.

556
00:33:08.841 --> 00:33:13.330
I think it's,
I think [inaudible] so cool.

557
00:33:13.520 --> 00:33:16.430
I don't know if it's cool or not,
but I do do it,

558
00:33:17.180 --> 00:33:20.930
but I don't square here and I don't square or when I'm presenting and I don't

559
00:33:20.931 --> 00:33:24.530
swear in front of my wife and kids and I really got in front of your wife.

560
00:33:24.680 --> 00:33:28.380
Not Really,
let's say that's bad enough,
but that's not really sure.

561
00:33:29.030 --> 00:33:33.950
I mean I try and give her some respect and treat,

562
00:33:33.980 --> 00:33:36.590
you know,
speak.
In fact,
when I do swear in front of her,

563
00:33:36.680 --> 00:33:39.980
I do it knowingly that I'm trying to make some kind of a,

564
00:33:40.670 --> 00:33:45.100
a statement about something that really emphasize on thing.
Okay,

565
00:33:45.340 --> 00:33:50.030
cool man.
That's good.
Okay.
Now let's get to the combating burnout.

566
00:33:50.031 --> 00:33:54.530
First of all,
it sounds like,
uh,
this guy right here has a lot going on,

567
00:33:54.770 --> 00:33:58.550
which is awesome.
Good for you.
Yeah,
that's killer.
Welcome to life.

568
00:33:58.790 --> 00:34:01.460
Right now.
A couple of things,
right?

569
00:34:03.050 --> 00:34:04.820
And I guess this might be a little bit of a theme tonight,

570
00:34:04.821 --> 00:34:06.410
but you gotta make it fun,
right?

571
00:34:06.411 --> 00:34:10.580
Instead of viewing these things like an oppressive grind.
I mean,

572
00:34:10.581 --> 00:34:14.060
just the way that,
you know,
at the maths,
like on the mats,

573
00:34:14.061 --> 00:34:18.160
I don't have time and life is making huge demands and I'm trying just to make,

574
00:34:18.260 --> 00:34:21.710
try to do just gymnastic strength training,
but without neglecting my wife.

575
00:34:21.710 --> 00:34:25.160
And it's like everything's a grind.
No,
it's not.
You have the opportunity.

576
00:34:25.161 --> 00:34:28.370
Did you gymnasts,
you've got a wife and you've got a dog.
So that's,
that's,

577
00:34:28.460 --> 00:34:31.760
that's awesome.
As Echo would say,
that's dope right there.

578
00:34:32.270 --> 00:34:36.860
So what,
you know,
instead of looking at him like that,

579
00:34:36.861 --> 00:34:41.570
let's look at them at what we can do to get more done.
Okay.
First of all,

580
00:34:41.571 --> 00:34:43.400
what kind of time constraints can you put on things?
Right.

581
00:34:43.401 --> 00:34:48.140
Force yourself to do some things faster.
Okay.
Um,

582
00:34:49.070 --> 00:34:51.980
for instance,
reading first thing in the morning.
I don't know,

583
00:34:52.040 --> 00:34:52.970
I don't agree with that.

584
00:34:53.030 --> 00:34:57.500
Like why would you get up in the morning and read reading?
No,
end of the day.

585
00:34:57.860 --> 00:34:59.690
Okay.
Playing music first thing in the morning.

586
00:35:00.500 --> 00:35:04.010
Playing music should be fun and enjoyable as should be.

587
00:35:04.011 --> 00:35:07.280
So getting up and going,
okay,
I'm going to go play music.

588
00:35:07.281 --> 00:35:11.090
You're turning it into a labor,
right?
You're turning it into a labor.

589
00:35:11.570 --> 00:35:14.990
It should be something that's down.
Why winding you down at the end of the night.

590
00:35:15.560 --> 00:35:17.360
So when you wake up in the morning,

591
00:35:17.361 --> 00:35:21.860
do something that requires some discipline and and has you get after it a little

592
00:35:21.861 --> 00:35:26.480
bit and wakes you up a little bit more.
Right.
Um,
you know,
another thing is,

593
00:35:26.510 --> 00:35:29.750
you know,
Jujitsu,
how,
this is a weird question,

594
00:35:29.751 --> 00:35:34.490
how fast can you train Jujitsu because I can tell you for many,

595
00:35:34.491 --> 00:35:37.380
many years and also what part did you did to,

596
00:35:37.381 --> 00:35:40.050
is important to you in what part of you getting the most out of cause for many,

597
00:35:40.051 --> 00:35:42.720
many years,
especially once the war started,

598
00:35:42.780 --> 00:35:46.950
when I would show up to train basically at the,

599
00:35:47.070 --> 00:35:48.240
at the end of class,

600
00:35:48.241 --> 00:35:51.600
and I still do this sometimes I show up when Dean has done teaching,

601
00:35:51.601 --> 00:35:55.560
when Jeff has done teaching,
believe me,
if I had unlimited hours,

602
00:35:55.620 --> 00:35:57.570
I would sit there and absorb everything that they have to say.

603
00:35:58.020 --> 00:36:01.650
I learned something from Dean the other day.
I couldn't believe it.

604
00:36:01.770 --> 00:36:04.110
I couldn't believe what I learned from Dean the other day.

605
00:36:04.140 --> 00:36:07.650
I couldn't believe that I didn't know it.
I couldn't believe that.

606
00:36:07.651 --> 00:36:10.740
I didn't know it.
I couldn't believe how well it worked.

607
00:36:11.010 --> 00:36:13.110
And I couldn't believe that that bastard never taught it to me,

608
00:36:13.470 --> 00:36:16.350
which made me really angry.
But that's the way it is.

609
00:36:16.351 --> 00:36:21.120
I've been training for 20 years and he taught me a basic fundamental thing that

610
00:36:21.121 --> 00:36:24.510
I did not know.
So if I could,
I'd of course I'd be in there all the time,

611
00:36:24.660 --> 00:36:25.530
you know,
learning,

612
00:36:25.531 --> 00:36:28.860
absorbing Glover's the same way Glover teaches you little things.
And he goes,
Oh,

613
00:36:28.861 --> 00:36:31.110
you should do this right here.
Go God man,
how did I not know that?

614
00:36:31.320 --> 00:36:34.500
So I would learn all I could,
but I don't know if it's time,
time for that.

615
00:36:34.530 --> 00:36:39.210
So what I do show up when that stuff's over,
can I go on a train,
get it on and

616
00:36:40.950 --> 00:36:45.300
how fast does it,
so I'm saying is how fast can you,
what,
what,

617
00:36:45.320 --> 00:36:49.770
what gets you the most impact in the shortest amount of time?
So for me,

618
00:36:49.920 --> 00:36:54.780
it's all I always feel if I don't have time to take an hour and a half class,

619
00:36:55.320 --> 00:36:58.350
that's,
you know,
a 10 minute warm up,
uh,

620
00:36:58.500 --> 00:37:01.110
30 minutes or 40 minutes of instruction to 10 minutes,

621
00:37:01.111 --> 00:37:04.920
20 minutes of his drilling and then half an hour of rolling or however long that

622
00:37:04.950 --> 00:37:09.390
I'll put together his,
but,
but I'm going to show up.
For me,

623
00:37:09.391 --> 00:37:13.200
the most important part at this juncture in my Jujitsu career is the rolling.

624
00:37:13.530 --> 00:37:16.740
So I'm going to show up for that last,
you know,
40 minutes,
45 minutes.

625
00:37:16.741 --> 00:37:20.220
I'm gonna get my rounds in.
Maybe that's what you need to do,
cause you can't,

626
00:37:20.340 --> 00:37:23.430
you don't have time to take an hour and a half class with all that other stuff.

627
00:37:23.610 --> 00:37:26.520
So see if you can do that.

628
00:37:26.521 --> 00:37:30.580
The other thing you might have to do is prioritize and execute the,
uh,
the,

629
00:37:30.670 --> 00:37:34.770
the extra,
extra curricular activities,
right?
What you got gymnastic alone,

630
00:37:34.771 --> 00:37:38.640
you've got BJ going on,
you've got reading,
you've got music going on.
How do you,

631
00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:39.833
um,

632
00:37:40.560 --> 00:37:45.560
how do you bring those things together or how do you prioritize them so that you

633
00:37:45.611 --> 00:37:49.740
are,
you focus on which one's going to be the most important?

634
00:37:49.770 --> 00:37:51.090
That's the bottom line,
right?

635
00:37:51.120 --> 00:37:54.360
Because you might not have time to do everything and so you might be just

636
00:37:54.361 --> 00:37:56.790
dabbling in all of them and not making any progress in any of them.

637
00:37:57.690 --> 00:38:00.360
So that's not good.
Another thing,

638
00:38:00.990 --> 00:38:04.260
how can you manipulate your work schedule,
right?

639
00:38:04.290 --> 00:38:09.150
What can you do at your work schedule that you could squeeze something in?

640
00:38:09.180 --> 00:38:12.720
For instance,
do people take a lunch break?

641
00:38:13.410 --> 00:38:17.820
Do people take a lunch break?
I haven't taken lunch in the,
in the seal teams.

642
00:38:17.910 --> 00:38:22.770
I didn't take lunch,
you know,
in,
why would you take lunch?
Like,
Oh,

643
00:38:22.771 --> 00:38:27.771
I'm going to go for an hour of time and go to a place and sit down and eat.

644
00:38:27.870 --> 00:38:31.080
No,
I'm gonna eat at my desk while I'm working,
so I'm never going to take lunch.

645
00:38:31.170 --> 00:38:34.380
So maybe during your work people are,
you know,
people,
hey,

646
00:38:34.381 --> 00:38:36.670
we're going to go down and some lunch.
Cool.
That's what I'm going to go do.

647
00:38:36.910 --> 00:38:39.210
You know,
500 burpees or whatever,

648
00:38:39.211 --> 00:38:41.070
we go run to the gym real quick and get a workout in everybody,

649
00:38:41.140 --> 00:38:45.340
my sprints or whatever.
So she what?
What can you do?
There may be,

650
00:38:45.850 --> 00:38:49.260
maybe you could get more work done in this time when you're waking up or leaks,

651
00:38:49.270 --> 00:38:49.930
you want to get after it.

652
00:38:49.930 --> 00:38:53.470
Maybe that's the time when you should go to the job because no one's going to

653
00:38:53.471 --> 00:38:56.980
bother you.
You can get a bunch of work done and then you can take a break from,

654
00:38:58.090 --> 00:39:01.540
from seven until nine when the rest of the coming in with their coffee and want

655
00:39:01.541 --> 00:39:02.590
to talk to,
you know,

656
00:39:02.591 --> 00:39:04.630
that's when you're working out or that's when you're doing something else.

657
00:39:04.630 --> 00:39:07.800
So how can you maximize it?
I used to do this when I'm,

658
00:39:07.810 --> 00:39:12.280
we used to have to write evaluations for all of our guys and it's a big pain in

659
00:39:12.281 --> 00:39:17.080
the navy and they have to be perfect and they're getting recording guys record.

660
00:39:17.081 --> 00:39:18.650
So you want to be perfect.
You want to take the Africa,

661
00:39:18.680 --> 00:39:21.130
this is how the guys get evaluated so they can get advanced.

662
00:39:21.340 --> 00:39:25.480
So you want to take your time with it.
But during,
during we'd get,
you know,

663
00:39:25.481 --> 00:39:27.010
I was in charge,

664
00:39:27.011 --> 00:39:29.930
I get these big stacks of evils I'd have to go through and it's corrected some

665
00:39:29.950 --> 00:39:32.890
basically doing corrections of papers over and over and over again until they're

666
00:39:32.891 --> 00:39:37.240
perfect and it's meticulous work.

667
00:39:37.510 --> 00:39:39.730
And so what I would do is during that time period,

668
00:39:40.390 --> 00:39:42.130
it would take like a month to get it done.

669
00:39:42.280 --> 00:39:44.080
I wouldn't work out first thing in the morning.

670
00:39:44.290 --> 00:39:47.500
I would go to work immediately in the morning and while everyone else was either

671
00:39:47.501 --> 00:39:52.300
not there or I would work,
I would work.
And then when everyone showed up,

672
00:39:52.470 --> 00:39:56.470
you know,
at 11 I'd go work out during lunch and just,
you know,

673
00:39:56.471 --> 00:39:58.300
if you want to come talk to me because everyone always wants to talk to you.

674
00:39:58.301 --> 00:40:00.760
Right.
So I'm going to say to you again,

675
00:40:00.761 --> 00:40:04.540
just leave me alone cause I'm trying to work,
but maybe you,

676
00:40:04.541 --> 00:40:07.540
so how can you manipulate your work to,

677
00:40:08.010 --> 00:40:09.820
to maximize what you're getting out of it.

678
00:40:11.290 --> 00:40:14.710
Another thing is maybe take a little break from some of the activities.

679
00:40:14.711 --> 00:40:18.760
Maybe take a break from music,
maybe take a break from,
or maybe you say,
Oh,

680
00:40:18.761 --> 00:40:21.610
you know what?
I've been doing an hour of music a day.

681
00:40:21.670 --> 00:40:23.800
You don't want to change that.
I'm going to do for the next month.

682
00:40:23.800 --> 00:40:26.350
I'm only going to do 15 minutes just to keep my,

683
00:40:26.740 --> 00:40:29.590
keep my skills maintained,

684
00:40:29.591 --> 00:40:31.810
but I'm not going to progress and progress and I understand that.

685
00:40:32.620 --> 00:40:35.800
And or maybe you take a break from the mats for two weeks.

686
00:40:35.950 --> 00:40:37.840
I can tell you if you're training every day,

687
00:40:37.960 --> 00:40:42.880
a two week break from the mat in many cases myself,
definitely I take a jump up,

688
00:40:42.881 --> 00:40:46.120
I get better if I take a break.
That's why I travel.
For me,

689
00:40:46.150 --> 00:40:47.980
I don't like it when it goes on all the time,

690
00:40:47.981 --> 00:40:50.800
but I go away for six days and don't train.

691
00:40:51.220 --> 00:40:54.340
I come back and I feel a little bit better.
I have some stuff gels in the brain,

692
00:40:54.670 --> 00:40:58.030
so
yeah,
I have no problem.

693
00:40:58.060 --> 00:41:01.300
That used to make dean one time a kid one on one time.

694
00:41:01.301 --> 00:41:06.301
I came home from deployment and Dina and I were training and I was just so fired

695
00:41:06.311 --> 00:41:09.850
up,
you know,
coming and I was kind of smashing him and I'm yelling at him,

696
00:41:09.940 --> 00:41:12.160
you know,
I've been on deployment,
I've been overseas,

697
00:41:12.280 --> 00:41:14.900
what have you been doing back here?
Outcome,
I'm crushing you,
blah,
blah,
blah.

698
00:41:14.901 --> 00:41:16.360
And just crushing him that day.

699
00:41:16.690 --> 00:41:20.380
And so he went home that night and he made us is when he had to burn.

700
00:41:20.410 --> 00:41:22.780
This is when you had to burn cds.
He made it,

701
00:41:22.810 --> 00:41:26.830
he made a CD that was called killed Jocko.
That was all of his favorite,

702
00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:29.050
whatever metal songs.

703
00:41:29.051 --> 00:41:31.900
Then he came back and the next day he came back and destroyed me.
So yeah,

704
00:41:31.901 --> 00:41:35.780
he did kill Jocko that next.
But uh,
yeah,

705
00:41:35.781 --> 00:41:39.680
so taking a break sometime just to,
just to focus on some of the other stuff.

706
00:41:39.710 --> 00:41:42.140
The other thing,
okay,
you got your wife and your dog.

707
00:41:43.780 --> 00:41:47.780
I spend time with them while you're doing these activities.
Right.

708
00:41:47.810 --> 00:41:51.620
Your dog can go running with you.
Right.
That's awesome.
Your dog and come to park.

709
00:41:51.680 --> 00:41:53.780
Watch.
You do pull ups,
right?

710
00:41:53.810 --> 00:41:56.750
Your dog can chase the Kettlebell that you're,

711
00:41:56.960 --> 00:41:58.900
that you're throwing or whatever the,
the,

712
00:41:58.901 --> 00:42:01.260
the shot put or the medicine ball you can,
you can have,

713
00:42:01.490 --> 00:42:04.160
be careful if you're throwing your candle dog cause might've been bad.

714
00:42:04.160 --> 00:42:08.690
Bad Advice.
You feel kettle bells.
I was still,
I was with my buddy,

715
00:42:08.691 --> 00:42:11.060
we were in New Jersey one time and we went through cattle bells.

716
00:42:11.061 --> 00:42:16.061
It was wintertime and we were throwing kettlebells in the kettlebells would get,

717
00:42:16.370 --> 00:42:20.240
it was part of the workout was you had to dig the Kettlebell backup,
the mud.

718
00:42:20.800 --> 00:42:22.400
It was pretty funny.
Anyways,

719
00:42:22.430 --> 00:42:25.520
so what my point would say that if you threw your kettlebell and it hit a dog,

720
00:42:25.730 --> 00:42:27.830
it would not be good.
So don't do that one.

721
00:42:28.100 --> 00:42:30.950
But take your dog with you to the park.
Go have fun.
Hang out.

722
00:42:31.430 --> 00:42:33.590
And same thing with your wife.
You know what?

723
00:42:33.591 --> 00:42:35.750
Your wife doesn't want to do some Jujitsu.

724
00:42:35.840 --> 00:42:38.120
My wife did Jujitsu before she was pregnant,

725
00:42:38.121 --> 00:42:39.650
so when she was coming to the gym with me all the time,

726
00:42:40.160 --> 00:42:41.540
she was training and then you're just,

727
00:42:41.840 --> 00:42:45.500
let's bring it into the family a little bit.
Get her in.
She gymnastics.

728
00:42:45.650 --> 00:42:50.480
Get your Tim Ferris Acro Yoga on with with your girl,
right.

729
00:42:50.810 --> 00:42:53.180
That's the same thing.
Get her in the game,

730
00:42:53.660 --> 00:42:56.750
have her lay down some vocal tracks.
Right.

731
00:42:56.920 --> 00:42:59.870
To get me a little backing vocals from Mama.

732
00:43:00.290 --> 00:43:04.850
Let's hear what that sounds like and that way you're doing the stuff that you

733
00:43:04.851 --> 00:43:07.940
want to do,
what you're bringing your family into the game a little bit.

734
00:43:08.390 --> 00:43:10.010
And like I said,
man,

735
00:43:10.011 --> 00:43:14.210
I have fun because all these things that you're talking about,

736
00:43:14.211 --> 00:43:15.350
even being a prosecutor,

737
00:43:15.351 --> 00:43:19.910
which I'm sure like you said in beds you and just violence and disturbing things

738
00:43:19.911 --> 00:43:22.310
all the time and it's a challenging job.
But,

739
00:43:23.520 --> 00:43:27.020
but enjoy that challenge and how can you do a better and how can you win,

740
00:43:27.050 --> 00:43:31.280
you know,
I'm going to have fun with it.
And I had fun all the time.

741
00:43:31.281 --> 00:43:34.760
I had fun overseas,
I had fun in Iraq,
I had fun on the,

742
00:43:35.210 --> 00:43:39.350
in the bowels of a ship while I was deployed on for six months.

743
00:43:39.500 --> 00:43:43.190
I'm going to have fun and laugh hysterically at things.

744
00:43:43.191 --> 00:43:47.180
And it's the same thing with the music and with working out and Jujitsu and you

745
00:43:47.181 --> 00:43:52.130
got to,
you got to enjoy them all.
And just like when you're on the mat,

746
00:43:52.190 --> 00:43:53.930
you're competing against these young monsters.

747
00:43:53.931 --> 00:43:57.620
And we just try and compete with everybody.
Just try and get better

748
00:43:59.360 --> 00:44:03.110
cause that is winning.
And that's what's gonna make you better in the long run.

749
00:44:04.700 --> 00:44:08.930
Cause that'll make you stick with things,
make you stick with them.

750
00:44:09.680 --> 00:44:12.320
Because if you don't enjoy Jujitsu,
why would you do it for 25 years?

751
00:44:12.360 --> 00:44:15.680
Or if you don't enjoy music,
why would you keep practicing it?

752
00:44:15.710 --> 00:44:20.660
So my final thought on this man,
my brother have some fun with this stuff.

753
00:44:22.700 --> 00:44:24.920
Yeah.
The Dang and being a prosecutor,

754
00:44:25.200 --> 00:44:27.740
that's the kind of job where even when you go home,

755
00:44:28.410 --> 00:44:31.010
probably it's still in your mind,
you know?
So

756
00:44:32.010 --> 00:44:34.800
<v 3>as far as the whole experience,
it's like,
Dang,
this is,</v>

757
00:44:34.801 --> 00:44:37.590
my job is taking up so much time.
It's true.

758
00:44:37.800 --> 00:44:39.870
So yeah,

759
00:44:39.871 --> 00:44:44.871
I would imagine that would make it more of an like a difficult thing to balance.

760
00:44:45.720 --> 00:44:49.230
Figuring out that way to leave your job,
leave your job at work.
Yeah.
Right.

761
00:44:49.320 --> 00:44:50.340
We want to excel at it.

762
00:44:50.780 --> 00:44:54.890
I just had this conversation with a guy today just because if you're looking at

763
00:44:54.891 --> 00:44:56.430
your you,
you can't,

764
00:44:57.390 --> 00:45:02.100
the way you're going to do your job better as a prosecutor is not by just being

765
00:45:02.101 --> 00:45:05.890
100% focused on that 100% of the time.
You will not do a better job,
right?

766
00:45:06.180 --> 00:45:07.830
If you do good job,

767
00:45:07.831 --> 00:45:11.760
if you focus on that a lot and you still do Jujitsu and you still train and you

768
00:45:11.761 --> 00:45:15.000
still get after it,
you still you that.
How many good ideas?

769
00:45:15.060 --> 00:45:18.900
I have so many good ideas that come to me when I'm working out when I'm doing

770
00:45:18.901 --> 00:45:20.490
yard work because you've got to get,

771
00:45:20.630 --> 00:45:22.950
you've got to give your brain a little space to think.

772
00:45:23.400 --> 00:45:25.950
It's just like planning a seal operation.

773
00:45:26.100 --> 00:45:29.280
If you're sitting there looking at the map from two inches away the whole day

774
00:45:29.310 --> 00:45:30.570
trying to get this plan perfect,

775
00:45:30.571 --> 00:45:33.600
you're not going to see everything and it's the same thing with any job that you

776
00:45:33.601 --> 00:45:35.940
have.
If you get yourself totally wrapped around that job,

777
00:45:35.941 --> 00:45:37.410
you're not going to have the PR,

778
00:45:37.440 --> 00:45:41.850
the proper detachment from the job to see the bigger picture.

779
00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:46.470
So you must get some space between you and your job so you can think properly.

780
00:45:46.740 --> 00:45:51.000
Yeah.
And just like,
and that other element,
like everything you do,

781
00:45:51.870 --> 00:45:56.070
studying,
working out,
it's like this where you,
you've worked hard,

782
00:45:56.190 --> 00:45:58.260
you get your reps and then you get your rest.

783
00:45:58.410 --> 00:46:01.020
You can't be doing push ups all day every single day.
You know,

784
00:46:01.050 --> 00:46:03.330
you won't get stronger actually.
Yeah.
Right.
So when you know,

785
00:46:03.331 --> 00:46:07.050
just like studying where they say like,
I guess when you study or memorize and,

786
00:46:07.110 --> 00:46:09.300
or both,
whatever.
And then you go to sleep,

787
00:46:09.301 --> 00:46:14.130
that's when they get your neural connections get solidified.

788
00:46:14.160 --> 00:46:16.920
Gets the,
yeah.
When you sleep,
that's not when you're studying.

789
00:46:16.921 --> 00:46:20.430
So if you're cramming for a test for two days straight,
no sleeping,
you know,

790
00:46:20.850 --> 00:46:24.900
that won't help you as much as sunny for four hours properly getting some good

791
00:46:24.901 --> 00:46:27.720
sleep,
get your rest.
Yeah.
So that's the same thing with the job.
You know,

792
00:46:27.721 --> 00:46:31.010
get grind on the job and then men forget about it for a little bit.

793
00:46:31.020 --> 00:46:33.960
When you come back,
it'll make me better put the same.
It's,
it's weird.
Uh,

794
00:46:34.260 --> 00:46:37.410
coincidentally,
that's what I just said happens at Jitsu.
Exactly right.

795
00:46:37.411 --> 00:46:41.740
Just so you know.
Exactly right.
And a little tip in,
on and off this would it,

796
00:46:42.390 --> 00:46:45.340
I know this because I know how that feels when you're like,
Dang,
I've,

797
00:46:45.420 --> 00:46:49.350
I work so much and I don't have time to go work out or whatever,

798
00:46:49.351 --> 00:46:52.470
or I'm always pressed for time or whatever.
You can kind of overlap the two.

799
00:46:52.471 --> 00:46:57.390
So what I did,
I'd go to work and then right after work I'd go home,

800
00:46:57.450 --> 00:47:00.630
had changed,
and then I'd go to the gym and then I'd be like,
man,

801
00:47:00.631 --> 00:47:01.680
I don't have time for anything.

802
00:47:01.681 --> 00:47:05.670
If I expect to workout as much as I need to in my mind or as much as I want,

803
00:47:05.820 --> 00:47:07.150
I kind of have time for anything else.
But she was,

804
00:47:07.151 --> 00:47:10.380
I think you kind of do have time when you start to overlap.
So,

805
00:47:10.381 --> 00:47:13.560
and this is sounding real obvious and simple,
but sometimes you kind of,

806
00:47:13.770 --> 00:47:17.820
you miss these little things.
So what I ended up doing,
which a lot of people do,

807
00:47:17.821 --> 00:47:20.880
is they'll just,
you just bring your workout clothes and your preworkout to the,

808
00:47:20.970 --> 00:47:24.030
to work,
to work and then go straight to the gym.

809
00:47:24.900 --> 00:47:28.650
You saved yourself all kinds of time.
You said you actually got your workout,

810
00:47:29.080 --> 00:47:32.080
you saved 40 minutes just by doing that.
That was your workout.
And,

811
00:47:32.310 --> 00:47:34.990
and that's not to mention you,
when you go home,
a lot of time,

812
00:47:34.991 --> 00:47:38.680
you have this a lot of times at subconscious to it so that you start to just

813
00:47:38.681 --> 00:47:43.240
mellow out.
So the chance of you skipping a workout becomes site.
That's a,

814
00:47:43.241 --> 00:47:46.810
that's a different thing for sure.
But um,
that seems like an obvious thing,

815
00:47:46.811 --> 00:47:48.880
you know,
like,
yeah,
bring your,
if you're going to work out afterwards,

816
00:47:49.090 --> 00:47:50.500
it seems obvious.
I know,
but

817
00:47:52.030 --> 00:47:56.090
there's other things just like that in like life or let me just overlap them.

818
00:47:57.310 --> 00:48:01.770
Eating lunch at your desk.
Same exact things.
Just straight up efficiency.
Yeah.

819
00:48:01.960 --> 00:48:04.910
To do a whole podcast on just how to be more efficient.
Yeah.

820
00:48:04.990 --> 00:48:06.580
So if you're keeping your eyes open for,
okay,

821
00:48:06.581 --> 00:48:09.370
how can I little overlap here or up there and you'd be like,
aw Dang,

822
00:48:09.670 --> 00:48:12.190
I got two hours at the end of the day right now.

823
00:48:12.910 --> 00:48:17.350
Or just more time to do more stuff,
you know.
So just keep your eyes open man.

824
00:48:17.500 --> 00:48:20.800
And the Jujitsu thing too.
Back to the real quick,
the um,

825
00:48:21.520 --> 00:48:25.750
you said try to focus on like the parts that,
that help you the most.

826
00:48:25.751 --> 00:48:26.830
Like come in,
you know,

827
00:48:27.490 --> 00:48:31.180
don't quote unquote for lack of a better term or waste your time on like the

828
00:48:31.181 --> 00:48:32.050
warm up and you know,

829
00:48:32.051 --> 00:48:35.440
if that's not where you get the most learning before you do that,

830
00:48:35.620 --> 00:48:38.190
clear it with the instructor instruct.

831
00:48:38.200 --> 00:48:41.170
They don't dig it when you just skip the warm up rolling in when it's time to

832
00:48:41.171 --> 00:48:44.530
roll this like a thing.
So you've got to,
you got to say like a lot,

833
00:48:44.531 --> 00:48:47.710
like I'll do that too to your instructor and say,
Hey,

834
00:48:47.860 --> 00:48:49.000
I'm working a bunch right now.

835
00:48:49.001 --> 00:48:51.280
I got this case going on and I got to get through it.

836
00:48:51.280 --> 00:48:55.330
And so I'm only to come three times a week and all I have time for just to come

837
00:48:55.331 --> 00:48:58.850
in and roll.
Is that cool with you?
Yeah.
What are they going to say?
No.
Yeah,

838
00:48:59.050 --> 00:49:02.620
or just say at this time,
because if you say I can only have time to roll,

839
00:49:02.621 --> 00:49:04.420
they're like,
oh you want to skip my lesson?

840
00:49:04.421 --> 00:49:07.170
Then that's the part he chose to skip.
So you can say,
Hey,

841
00:49:07.171 --> 00:49:12.130
I can only come in at this time.
Well I've been in that situation where,
you know,

842
00:49:12.131 --> 00:49:14.760
I've been working on this thing and also other schedules.

843
00:49:14.761 --> 00:49:16.540
I had my new baby and all this stuff.
So it's like Dang,

844
00:49:16.541 --> 00:49:21.080
the only time I can come in realistically,
um,

845
00:49:21.550 --> 00:49:26.400
was that to get there at like 1235 just to get your role in?

846
00:49:26.470 --> 00:49:27.303
Yeah.

847
00:49:27.460 --> 00:49:31.760
When you know the one that led the instruction starts at noon and then I,

848
00:49:32.290 --> 00:49:36.910
I know Jeff was like,
you know how your bill thinks he can just real,

849
00:49:36.911 --> 00:49:40.430
I don't know if he thought this or not.
It's probably me being,
I felt,

850
00:49:40.480 --> 00:49:43.570
but it could have been me being paranoid.
Greg encourages that by the way.

851
00:49:43.600 --> 00:49:47.950
Great chain.
He encourages.
If you get more out of just rolling,

852
00:49:47.951 --> 00:49:50.290
then you do the lesson.
Like when you get to a certain belt and you're,

853
00:49:50.320 --> 00:49:53.500
you know how you're learning starts to take shape.
Like what you learn better,

854
00:49:53.830 --> 00:49:54.401
he encourages it.

855
00:49:54.401 --> 00:49:58.990
But the only thing is that just saying what I just learned from Dean the other

856
00:49:58.990 --> 00:50:03.100
day and how,
what other things have I missed?
Yeah.
But you know what I mean?

857
00:50:03.101 --> 00:50:07.900
But that's an opportunity,
cost situation,
you know,
Dang cause important stuff.

858
00:50:08.770 --> 00:50:13.240
But
I always,
uh,
like even if I'm,

859
00:50:13.270 --> 00:50:14.560
if I get there a little late,
I'll be like,

860
00:50:14.561 --> 00:50:18.130
I'll look and see what moves they showed and,
and I'll,

861
00:50:18.580 --> 00:50:21.250
and I'll figure it out if there's anything I didn't know.
Yeah.

862
00:50:21.251 --> 00:50:23.400
But how can you figure out if there's something you didn't know?
No,

863
00:50:23.420 --> 00:50:25.550
because I say,
hey man,
what'd you teach today?
Or I'll watch guys,

864
00:50:25.650 --> 00:50:27.700
what'd you guys do?
What'd you guys go over today?
And that's all this.

865
00:50:27.710 --> 00:50:27.980
And I'll go,

866
00:50:27.980 --> 00:50:30.650
<v 0>Hey Jeff,
how does that work?
Or I'll say,
hey dean,
what's this thing here?</v>

867
00:50:31.100 --> 00:50:35.170
So I'll just ask him,
you know,
basically reteach the whole class.
No,

868
00:50:35.180 --> 00:50:38.150
not reached cause he,
cause like you just said,
my learning is developed.

869
00:50:38.151 --> 00:50:39.080
So all they need to say is,
hey,

870
00:50:39.081 --> 00:50:42.230
we went over this escape right here and we went over this finish and here's how

871
00:50:42.231 --> 00:50:46.340
you do it or this transition.
Right.
Right.
So,
but that one,
yeah.

872
00:50:46.341 --> 00:50:51.290
You got to kind of communicate Spec,
respect had Spec your instruction.

873
00:50:51.590 --> 00:50:55.670
We'll ha yeah,
totally.
Got It.
Next question.

874
00:50:56.740 --> 00:51:01.740
<v 2>I've encountered an issue in the workplace I've never dealt with before.</v>

875
00:51:02.030 --> 00:51:05.380
I'm a former Air Force Sto.
Sdl.

876
00:51:05.700 --> 00:51:07.970
<v 0>Yup.
This is like a combat controller.
They call in,</v>

877
00:51:08.510 --> 00:51:13.490
they call in aircraft.
They set up,
they call for fire,
they set up,
uh,

878
00:51:13.940 --> 00:51:16.760
they set up air strips and a field.
Really cool job.

879
00:51:16.800 --> 00:51:19.550
<v 2>Okay.
Okay.
As it says there,
or as you may affect an lean,</v>

880
00:51:19.630 --> 00:51:24.500
know us as combat control.
Okay.
I'm not civilian mechanical engineer.

881
00:51:24.680 --> 00:51:29.360
Dang big up in the oil and gas industry through attrition.

882
00:51:29.390 --> 00:51:34.280
The people I work closely with have learned a little about what it is I used to

883
00:51:34.281 --> 00:51:38.960
do.
I'm treated noticeably different as a result.
For example,

884
00:51:38.961 --> 00:51:41.090
some refer to me as Mr Esef.

885
00:51:41.091 --> 00:51:45.290
Now my current approach is just to laugh it off and ignore it.

886
00:51:45.740 --> 00:51:49.640
But how can I respectfully indicate that when I'm in the office,

887
00:51:50.780 --> 00:51:53.690
I'm not that anymore and no different than anyone else.

888
00:51:55.750 --> 00:51:59.070
<v 0>Well,
I think you're taking the right approach and that is to ignore it.
Um,</v>

889
00:52:00.420 --> 00:52:05.410
I think there's probably something about your history,

890
00:52:05.470 --> 00:52:05.771
right,

891
00:52:05.771 --> 00:52:09.520
that people get a little bit either intimidated or comfortable with in some way

892
00:52:09.521 --> 00:52:11.560
because they think all of a sudden,
you know,
you're,

893
00:52:11.590 --> 00:52:13.690
you're this different type of thing.

894
00:52:13.691 --> 00:52:17.590
But I think it is definitely something where at well,

895
00:52:18.460 --> 00:52:21.760
in the seal teams,
the minute you say,
Hey,
don't call me that,

896
00:52:23.350 --> 00:52:27.730
like people,
that's what we asked you,
your nickname for life,
if you say that.
So,

897
00:52:28.480 --> 00:52:32.110
you know,
I think we know for one thing,

898
00:52:32.111 --> 00:52:35.080
it sounds like you're not referring back to your time in the service on the a

899
00:52:35.081 --> 00:52:39.640
lot.
But another thing is don't,
a subtle thing is don't answer to,

900
00:52:40.090 --> 00:52:42.650
you know,
Mr Esef just don't answer.

901
00:52:42.660 --> 00:52:45.010
They're not saying you have to be a jerk about it.

902
00:52:45.250 --> 00:52:48.250
But if someone says Miss Mr Esef,

903
00:52:48.310 --> 00:52:51.530
hey Mr Esef and just like keep doing what you're doing until,

904
00:52:51.620 --> 00:52:55.000
and so don't reinforce that that's what they should call you,
right?

905
00:52:55.030 --> 00:53:00.010
That's just like a basic,
a basic thing.
But I think you're doing the right thing.

906
00:53:00.100 --> 00:53:03.640
And I mean,
if you ever wanted to say something about it again,

907
00:53:03.641 --> 00:53:04.720
the minute you say something about it,

908
00:53:04.721 --> 00:53:06.140
now all of a sudden it turns into a big deal.

909
00:53:06.170 --> 00:53:08.380
Now people are whispering like he doesn't like to talk about it.

910
00:53:09.070 --> 00:53:14.020
So now we're in that situation.
So man,
just ignore it.

911
00:53:14.021 --> 00:53:18.490
Keep working.
And I mean,
carry on with your,

912
00:53:18.491 --> 00:53:19.690
with your mission,
with these,

913
00:53:19.691 --> 00:53:22.390
with these guys and the gas and there's a bunch of veterans and a gas,

914
00:53:22.391 --> 00:53:26.270
oil industry.
I'm in the,
there.
Did you know,
um,
when,
when we work with gas,

915
00:53:26.271 --> 00:53:29.340
oil was a lead.
A bunch of vets.
Maybe that's more on the front line troopers.

916
00:53:29.341 --> 00:53:32.710
But man,
I met a bunch of,
no,
a bunch of veterans.
Um,

917
00:53:33.510 --> 00:53:37.650
so I don't know,
maybe,
maybe they,
maybe they saw a little,

918
00:53:37.800 --> 00:53:41.280
a little reaction they got from you.
So let's make sure we're not doing that.

919
00:53:41.310 --> 00:53:45.460
Just ignore it and carry on the best thing you can do right in no,

920
00:53:45.461 --> 00:53:50.170
in the seal teams,
if somebody does something that annoys you,
do not show it.

921
00:53:50.460 --> 00:53:53.550
Same thing with my family,
with my kids,
man.

922
00:53:53.551 --> 00:53:56.580
When my kids figure out that something annoys one of my other kids and they just

923
00:53:56.840 --> 00:54:01.350
were relentless annihilation with that,
whatever that thing is.

924
00:54:01.920 --> 00:54:04.960
And I did that when I was a kid.
I was,
you know,
my sisters and I,

925
00:54:04.961 --> 00:54:09.320
we were so mean to each other on whatever.
And that's sort of,
I dunno,

926
00:54:09.330 --> 00:54:12.380
I guess that's sort of a tradition in my family is,
you know,
um,

927
00:54:12.450 --> 00:54:16.830
it's sort of a tradition is of no emotional mercy,
right?
If you find something,

928
00:54:16.831 --> 00:54:21.000
you're just going to grind on it and that's the way,
that's the way it works.

929
00:54:21.030 --> 00:54:23.700
And also no credit,
no credit will be given.

930
00:54:25.230 --> 00:54:30.030
There's no credit will be given you.
This is like,
oh,
oh yeah,
whatever.
So,

931
00:54:30.600 --> 00:54:35.390
uh,
but yeah,
man,
ignore it.
They'll get over it.
Kind of like on heart.

932
00:54:35.391 --> 00:54:39.210
Remember the Lionheart when he's like the Van Damme Movie Man.
Anyway,

933
00:54:39.211 --> 00:54:41.640
he goes into the final thing against the big guy should do it.

934
00:54:41.641 --> 00:54:44.910
Another podcast without me.
When you talk about cheesy movies,

935
00:54:45.120 --> 00:54:47.640
I'm telling you to say,
it doesn't matter that movie tooth,
you're not,

936
00:54:47.670 --> 00:54:50.910
it's the exact same concept,
but you can't show it.
So he goes in broken rape,

937
00:54:51.840 --> 00:54:56.550
all the money's on the table,
whatever.
Broken Rib.
He's like,

938
00:54:56.551 --> 00:55:00.120
he gets hit in the rear.
Well no,
he doesn't get hit in the ribs.
He like,

939
00:55:00.121 --> 00:55:03.300
he goes to him and there were any flinches like all quick.
And the guy,

940
00:55:03.301 --> 00:55:06.960
the big guy,
he's fighting goes boom,
he flinches I'll quick.
And he goes,

941
00:55:08.210 --> 00:55:12.090
see what I'm saying?
Hmm.
Nope.
Good.

942
00:55:13.350 --> 00:55:18.210
Is it ever,
okay,
so next question.
Next question.
Yeah,
sure.
All right.

943
00:55:18.211 --> 00:55:21.240
This is just my question and I'm busting out in the middle of it.
Last one.
Okay.

944
00:55:21.241 --> 00:55:22.074
Yeah.

945
00:55:22.980 --> 00:55:26.790
Is it ever okay to violate core values to achieve a goal?

946
00:55:28.980 --> 00:55:30.390
Okay.
So first of all,

947
00:55:31.080 --> 00:55:36.080
really obvious your values and your goals should be aligned.

948
00:55:36.900 --> 00:55:40.110
They should not be adversarial,
they shouldn't be countered to each other.

949
00:55:40.470 --> 00:55:43.350
And if you think about what your goals are,

950
00:55:43.351 --> 00:55:47.280
your goals should be set up in a way that they support your values and vice

951
00:55:47.281 --> 00:55:49.200
versa.
That's just the way it is.

952
00:55:49.201 --> 00:55:51.720
So I'm not sure where this is going to be an issue.

953
00:55:51.721 --> 00:55:54.750
If you're setting up goals that are contrary to your values,

954
00:55:54.751 --> 00:55:55.740
you've got some issues.

955
00:55:55.741 --> 00:56:00.741
Now I guess if you had the goal of winning the Blue Blue Belt Jujitsu

956
00:56:02.071 --> 00:56:06.270
championships,
and in order to win you,
you cheated.

957
00:56:06.510 --> 00:56:09.400
Like you claim someone was reaping your leg and use it.
Oh,

958
00:56:09.600 --> 00:56:11.640
you tap and you get the guide to qualify it and you win.

959
00:56:11.670 --> 00:56:16.080
That's could be an example right now.
Do I support that?
No.
You know,
that's wrong.

960
00:56:16.081 --> 00:56:16.411
You,

961
00:56:16.411 --> 00:56:20.730
you go win against the values of actually the values of martial arts to do that.

962
00:56:20.731 --> 00:56:23.230
So you didn't win anything and you didn't achieve your goal because weren't

963
00:56:23.231 --> 00:56:27.970
actually the best.
So I say no on that one.
Uh,
another one.

964
00:56:28.870 --> 00:56:33.040
Let's say you wanted to make a certain level of profit at your company.

965
00:56:33.960 --> 00:56:34.550
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

966
00:56:34.550 --> 00:56:38.670
<v 0>So you cheated a little bit on the quality of the manufacturing and you sold</v>

967
00:56:38.671 --> 00:56:43.340
items that weren't quite reliable.
Do I support that?

968
00:56:43.370 --> 00:56:47.810
No.
Right.
For annual.
And why?
Let me tell you why.
Because your goal,

969
00:56:48.530 --> 00:56:51.440
your goal is not even aligned with your goal itself.

970
00:56:51.441 --> 00:56:56.240
Because when you start making substandard manufactured items,

971
00:56:56.330 --> 00:56:58.160
what's going to happen in the long run,
people are going to say,

972
00:56:58.161 --> 00:57:02.330
we don't like these.
Yeah,
we're not going to buy him anymore.
So you didn't win.

973
00:57:02.720 --> 00:57:05.300
You might've wanted the short term,
but you didn't win in.
And again,

974
00:57:05.301 --> 00:57:08.750
you're going against your value.
You should have values that you don't want to.

975
00:57:09.800 --> 00:57:10.210
<v 1>Hmm.</v>

976
00:57:10.210 --> 00:57:14.020
<v 0>You know,
take profit over making good product.
And again,</v>

977
00:57:14.590 --> 00:57:17.890
in the long run,
that value is going to cost you.
Right.

978
00:57:17.920 --> 00:57:22.750
People aren't going to want to buy your product anymore.
Okay.

979
00:57:22.770 --> 00:57:23.710
Another one I could think of,

980
00:57:23.711 --> 00:57:27.670
like let's say your goal was to lose weight or to gain weight or whatever,

981
00:57:28.030 --> 00:57:32.680
some kind of positive physical change.
Answer.
You're working hard,

982
00:57:32.681 --> 00:57:35.200
but then you decide you're going to jump on steroids,
right?

983
00:57:35.201 --> 00:57:39.070
You're gonna jump on steroids and,
and you get that goal,
right?

984
00:57:39.071 --> 00:57:41.740
Because steroids are a huge advantage.
But again,

985
00:57:41.741 --> 00:57:44.890
I say no because if you can think about what your goal is,

986
00:57:44.891 --> 00:57:48.340
like why are you trying to gain weight or lose weight?
Your goal is to,

987
00:57:48.450 --> 00:57:52.450
is to be healthy,
right?
That's your value as you value your health.

988
00:57:53.020 --> 00:57:56.290
And so when the minute you start doing something that's countered your health,

989
00:57:57.040 --> 00:57:59.660
well that's not,
that's not helping your longterm.

990
00:58:00.070 --> 00:58:02.890
It's your value is not aligned with your goal and your goal is not aligned with

991
00:58:02.891 --> 00:58:04.570
your value.
So get them lined up.

992
00:58:04.870 --> 00:58:05.703
<v 1>Mm.</v>

993
00:58:07.570 --> 00:58:12.570
<v 0>So now might we at some point compromise our values,</v>

994
00:58:15.010 --> 00:58:16.990
compromise our values to reach a goal?

995
00:58:17.020 --> 00:58:20.710
I think that changes the answer a little bit,
right?
We might compromise.

996
00:58:21.300 --> 00:58:23.890
You remember that question that we had about the people that are snakes and how

997
00:58:23.891 --> 00:58:25.960
do you work with them?
You're eight.
You know,

998
00:58:25.961 --> 00:58:29.410
should you work with someone that's dishonest or backstabbing,

999
00:58:29.411 --> 00:58:34.411
but there are a cog in the machine of your team and your values right?

1000
00:58:35.860 --> 00:58:39.730
They might beat a,
call the person out and say,
hey,
you're a,

1001
00:58:39.731 --> 00:58:43.870
you're a backstabber and I don't want to work with you that that might be what

1002
00:58:43.871 --> 00:58:48.280
your values tell you to do,
but your goal end.
If you do that,

1003
00:58:48.520 --> 00:58:50.110
first of all,
you don't progress.
You don't,

1004
00:58:50.111 --> 00:58:52.690
your team doesn't work better together.
They work worse together.

1005
00:58:53.020 --> 00:58:58.020
And so in the long run you don't win because you stuck hardcore with your

1006
00:58:59.981 --> 00:59:04.100
values.
And by the way,
if you stick with your,
if you,

1007
00:59:04.120 --> 00:59:05.380
if you bend your values,

1008
00:59:05.381 --> 00:59:08.350
you compromise your values a little bit to get through this transitional period.

1009
00:59:08.560 --> 00:59:11.200
Now you get promoted,
now you get a situation where you can fire that person.

1010
00:59:11.201 --> 00:59:14.620
That's a backstabber.
So you,

1011
00:59:14.860 --> 00:59:18.250
you have to compromise your values as a personal little bit.

1012
00:59:20.930 --> 00:59:25.550
And you know,
there's the enemy of my enemy is my friend,
right?

1013
00:59:25.640 --> 00:59:27.320
The enemy of my enemy is my friend.

1014
00:59:27.321 --> 00:59:32.321
So you might compromise your values short term working somebody that you're not

1015
00:59:32.361 --> 00:59:35.030
totally aligned with value wise.
And again,

1016
00:59:35.210 --> 00:59:39.470
if you're going to get the long term strategic goal,

1017
00:59:39.500 --> 00:59:42.920
well then maybe it's worth it because going to put you in a position where you

1018
00:59:42.921 --> 00:59:46.970
can then hold your values better if from a,

1019
00:59:47.030 --> 00:59:49.970
from a senior position or from a more powerful position.

1020
00:59:50.270 --> 00:59:53.090
So you might compromise them a little bit.
Again,

1021
00:59:53.091 --> 00:59:56.090
these are small compromises and you should have things.
Of course,

1022
00:59:56.091 --> 01:00:00.320
we got things that values that you're,
you're never going to compromise on,

1023
01:00:01.100 --> 01:00:04.690
right?
I'm hitting a girl,
you know?
Right.

1024
01:00:05.670 --> 01:00:08.990
You should,
you should never hit a girl,
right.
Never hit a woman.

1025
01:00:10.610 --> 01:00:12.560
Now that being said,

1026
01:00:13.880 --> 01:00:18.740
if there's a woman that's about to do something truly evil,
you know,

1027
01:00:19.250 --> 01:00:21.890
kill a child or some kind of a terrorist act,

1028
01:00:21.891 --> 01:00:26.510
and the only thing you have that you can stop it is to hit her.
Well,
guess what?

1029
01:00:26.511 --> 01:00:28.850
She's getting hit.
You know what I mean?
So even then,

1030
01:00:29.540 --> 01:00:34.220
your value of never hitting a girl can be compromised momentarily while you stop

1031
01:00:34.720 --> 01:00:38.840
a child from being murdered or whatever.
Um,

1032
01:00:40.530 --> 01:00:43.870
do you know,
we,
as we hold a value of,
we always want to tell the truth.

1033
01:00:44.340 --> 01:00:45.173
<v 1>Mm.</v>

1034
01:00:46.360 --> 01:00:48.820
<v 0>But if you had a,
an extreme example,</v>

1035
01:00:48.821 --> 01:00:51.640
if you had some kind of a state secret and,

1036
01:00:52.330 --> 01:00:54.370
and you got captured,

1037
01:00:54.430 --> 01:00:57.940
well of course you might lie about that and there's little,

1038
01:00:57.941 --> 01:01:02.941
I mean we could get into a whole like white lie discussion on stuff like when

1039
01:01:03.311 --> 01:01:07.570
your wife asks you how's the chicken and you want to tell her it's the most dry

1040
01:01:07.890 --> 01:01:08.310
and,

1041
01:01:08.310 --> 01:01:13.310
and charcoal tasting item that you've ever put in your mouth,

1042
01:01:13.900 --> 01:01:16.780
that's not going to help you long term.
So I might,

1043
01:01:17.200 --> 01:01:22.200
I might compromise my values of being truthful and tell her it's pretty good.

1044
01:01:22.901 --> 01:01:27.280
Can I have some more ketchup over here?
Can I get some more barbecue sauce?

1045
01:01:27.310 --> 01:01:31.090
All this catch up on chicken and know and I'm going to go grab some more water.

1046
01:01:31.091 --> 01:01:34.930
Would you like to say?
So I might compromise my values a little bit there.

1047
01:01:35.780 --> 01:01:37.840
Uh,
so

1048
01:01:39.340 --> 01:01:41.470
I guess what I'm saying is,
and people,

1049
01:01:41.471 --> 01:01:46.471
this is the thing people probably what they think of my persona because people

1050
01:01:48.401 --> 01:01:52.090
will think,
oh,
on Charles was going to be this uncompromising,
never settle,

1051
01:01:52.091 --> 01:01:57.010
allow no slack kind of person.
Right?
That's when people want it.
Want,

1052
01:01:57.970 --> 01:02:00.520
you know,
want,
I guess want to see me as,

1053
01:02:00.580 --> 01:02:03.850
but the reality is reason,

1054
01:02:05.410 --> 01:02:09.070
reason and thought.
Hmm.
Can,

1055
01:02:09.100 --> 01:02:12.790
can override values for the right reasons.

1056
01:02:13.750 --> 01:02:18.200
And that's why we can think,
that's why we can think of there's,

1057
01:02:18.470 --> 01:02:19.440
there's actually times,

1058
01:02:20.190 --> 01:02:25.190
there's actually times we'd holding your values goes against your values.

1059
01:02:25.890 --> 01:02:29.280
So if yours backup your friends,
right?
You always back up your friends,

1060
01:02:29.640 --> 01:02:33.330
but then your friend does something that's totally immoral and is against your

1061
01:02:33.331 --> 01:02:34.164
values.

1062
01:02:34.260 --> 01:02:36.510
Well then you can't back up and you can't hold the value of backing up your

1063
01:02:36.511 --> 01:02:38.300
friends because guess what?
They did something immoral.

1064
01:02:38.580 --> 01:02:42.090
They did something that was wrong.
And so if you held your values,

1065
01:02:42.091 --> 01:02:46.430
you'd be not holding your values.
That's the dichotomy there,
right?

1066
01:02:46.470 --> 01:02:47.790
That's the dichotomy that,

1067
01:02:47.791 --> 01:02:51.900
and the additional dichotomy is you hold your values,
right?

1068
01:02:52.320 --> 01:02:56.550
You hold to those basic principles that you believe in,
but at the same time,

1069
01:02:56.551 --> 01:02:59.910
you've got to apply logic and reason to them to make sure that they are

1070
01:02:59.911 --> 01:03:03.450
supporting your longterm goal and your long term values.

1071
01:03:04.110 --> 01:03:05.010
Cause you don't wanna,

1072
01:03:05.550 --> 01:03:10.550
you don't want to make a hard stand on something that costs you everything.

1073
01:03:10.651 --> 01:03:14.130
We're now in the future.
You can no longer manipulate anymore situations.

1074
01:03:17.610 --> 01:03:22.610
That's one of the things that makes leadership and and life heart is that it

1075
01:03:22.921 --> 01:03:27.390
isn't black and white.
It isn't black and white.
It's gray in.

1076
01:03:27.391 --> 01:03:30.660
So our decisions on these very things,

1077
01:03:30.661 --> 01:03:35.210
these are the challenges of leadership
and there's,

1078
01:03:35.810 --> 01:03:38.650
there's no way right or wrong answer of,

1079
01:03:38.651 --> 01:03:42.890
of saying if it's right or wrong to violate your,
your values to achieve a goal.

1080
01:03:42.920 --> 01:03:45.860
That initial questions,
there's too many variables in that.

1081
01:03:45.950 --> 01:03:47.180
There's too many variables.

1082
01:03:47.420 --> 01:03:50.420
But start with this part that I started the whole answer with.

1083
01:03:50.480 --> 01:03:54.440
Align your values with your goal.
That's where you start.

1084
01:03:54.710 --> 01:03:56.750
And then you use reason

1085
01:03:58.780 --> 01:04:03.780
[inaudible] and fought to determine your actions based on the situation weighed

1086
01:04:04.501 --> 01:04:08.070
against your values.
You have to think.

1087
01:04:09.270 --> 01:04:13.290
Yeah.
So given what you're saying,
yes.

1088
01:04:14.350 --> 01:04:17.860
<v 2>So it's less like just values.</v>

1089
01:04:17.861 --> 01:04:21.130
Like you have a dinner plate with here's my values kind of thing.

1090
01:04:21.460 --> 01:04:24.040
It's more of a hierarchy of values.

1091
01:04:24.160 --> 01:04:28.180
So you will violate your values if it's on,
you know,

1092
01:04:28.240 --> 01:04:31.060
level two for a level four,
you know what I mean?

1093
01:04:31.120 --> 01:04:33.430
Like all hit all knock a girl right out.

1094
01:04:33.670 --> 01:04:38.410
If it's in the way of my higher value,
which is protect your family,

1095
01:04:38.411 --> 01:04:42.130
protect my family,
kids and all this stuff.
Same thing with girls.

1096
01:04:42.131 --> 01:04:44.860
Don't mess ladies out there.
Don't mess with that.
Goes family.

1097
01:04:45.100 --> 01:04:48.410
Please don't come in at you.
You know,
obviously same thing with you know,

1098
01:04:48.500 --> 01:04:52.980
the writing on your or backing up your friend.
Yeah.
You know,

1099
01:04:52.990 --> 01:04:55.690
my values back into my friend that's level two.
You know,

1100
01:04:55.691 --> 01:04:59.870
the whole air moral thing,
assaulting a girl,
I don't know.
Whatever the,
you know,

1101
01:05:00.490 --> 01:05:04.150
that's level four.
So sorry.
Number two,
you know,
I'm going for number four,

1102
01:05:04.151 --> 01:05:04.984
kindness.
So it was like a higher,

1103
01:05:05.120 --> 01:05:07.580
<v 0>yeah,
you got a little hierarchy.
Values.
There's some,
you know,</v>

1104
01:05:07.581 --> 01:05:10.730
obviously there's some that I can't eat.
You know,

1105
01:05:10.731 --> 01:05:15.440
you could give any of one of your highest values that you could come up with and

1106
01:05:15.441 --> 01:05:16.340
you could sit here and,

1107
01:05:16.380 --> 01:05:20.830
and theoretically come up with a situation where you would sacrifice that value

1108
01:05:21.030 --> 01:05:25.510
and that's fire.
That's just the way it is.
Yeah.
So that's why we're humans.

1109
01:05:25.540 --> 01:05:26.860
We have the ability to think,

1110
01:05:27.130 --> 01:05:30.850
we have the ability to reason and sometimes you might have to compromise your

1111
01:05:30.851 --> 01:05:35.851
values a little bit to who will survive to survive and get so that you can long

1112
01:05:38.640 --> 01:05:43.300
term
carry out your values to a higher degree.

1113
01:05:43.350 --> 01:05:45.900
<v 2>Yeah.
Yeah.
Like the um,</v>

1114
01:05:47.040 --> 01:05:50.010
back to the people want to lose weight,
you know,

1115
01:05:52.320 --> 01:05:56.640
if usually people who,
I don't know,

1116
01:05:56.641 --> 01:05:59.790
I guess I would imagine that usually people who take steroids,

1117
01:05:59.820 --> 01:06:02.640
their value isn't the health.
It's like,
cause people did typically,

1118
01:06:02.660 --> 01:06:05.430
unless it's a medical thing point,
you know,

1119
01:06:05.431 --> 01:06:09.270
the story would think for Allie it's for to win or to cool.
Yeah.

1120
01:06:09.271 --> 01:06:11.100
Which is kind of strange,
but you know,

1121
01:06:11.180 --> 01:06:15.480
it's usually to win a competition or something like this.
But um,
but nonetheless,

1122
01:06:15.481 --> 01:06:16.980
I think that holds true given what you said.

1123
01:06:17.100 --> 01:06:20.250
And I think it's kind of kind of coming together there.

1124
01:06:20.280 --> 01:06:22.710
I think that it is like a hierarchy of values.

1125
01:06:22.800 --> 01:06:27.060
<v 0>Yeah.
Yeah.
And if someone's going to use steroids to cheat,</v>

1126
01:06:27.270 --> 01:06:31.470
that's,
I mean even that we could,
it's a whole nother discussion.

1127
01:06:31.650 --> 01:06:34.290
But what do they really proving?
One of they really winning,

1128
01:06:34.680 --> 01:06:36.710
<v 2>right?
Yeah.
And that goes back to remember,
uh,</v>

1129
01:06:36.850 --> 01:06:39.390
I forget what we were talking about.
Like some people like they want to,

1130
01:06:39.900 --> 01:06:42.740
they want to,
they want to appear to win.
You know,

1131
01:06:42.750 --> 01:06:45.750
especially now you can see it on like online that you don't spend that much time

1132
01:06:46.320 --> 01:06:50.730
just cruising Facebook,
but you see,
you can see someone that,
you know,

1133
01:06:51.300 --> 01:06:55.650
I don't know.
They're there.
They're about to murder each other.
Husband and wife,

1134
01:06:55.651 --> 01:06:57.960
they hate each other.
They don't even sleep in the same room,

1135
01:06:58.110 --> 01:07:01.110
but they went on vacation with their kids or whatever and they're like,
oh,

1136
01:07:01.111 --> 01:07:04.200
so in love in front of the Ferris wheel or the waterfall or whatever.

1137
01:07:04.410 --> 01:07:05.243
And you're like,
Bro,

1138
01:07:05.430 --> 01:07:10.020
you just want people to think you when you just want to up here.
That one,

1139
01:07:10.050 --> 01:07:13.830
you know,
but it's not real.
That's why people cheat.
Yeah.
That's what I liked.

1140
01:07:13.831 --> 01:07:16.560
The guy that you get to thing when they're like,
okay,
I'm going to,

1141
01:07:16.650 --> 01:07:19.320
I'm going to say,
this guy read my leg,
I'm gonna tap.
Oh,
he's Dq.

1142
01:07:19.330 --> 01:07:22.200
You can't do that.
But you know,
you cheated kind of thing.
He,

1143
01:07:22.210 --> 01:07:26.760
his goal wasn't to win,
it was just to get the metal.
So it's,
you know,

1144
01:07:26.790 --> 01:07:28.470
well he's getting,
the metal is damp here,

1145
01:07:28.560 --> 01:07:32.370
<v 0>but he's just,
he doesn't have the proper values actually be the winner.</v>

1146
01:07:32.400 --> 01:07:36.360
He needs to check his values.
He needs to check his hierarchy of values.

1147
01:07:37.110 --> 01:07:39.270
<v 2>Yeah.
Yeah.
So he didn't want to actually,</v>

1148
01:07:39.271 --> 01:07:43.560
when you wanted the metal tube here that he want kind of thing.

1149
01:07:45.720 --> 01:07:46.553
Next question.

1150
01:07:47.700 --> 01:07:52.140
Is there any way to recalibrate the flight or fight response?

1151
01:07:52.800 --> 01:07:57.420
I get that x,
I get that access in adrenaline.
Oh,

1152
01:07:57.421 --> 01:07:59.150
I get that.
Accessing adrenaline.

1153
01:07:59.160 --> 01:08:03.210
That gives me the wobbly legs and the flight response.

1154
01:08:04.710 --> 01:08:07.140
How do I go about remapping my reaction?

1155
01:08:08.270 --> 01:08:10.660
<v 0>Well,
absolutely.
Um,</v>

1156
01:08:10.880 --> 01:08:14.480
and I'm not 100% sure what situations you're talking about,

1157
01:08:14.540 --> 01:08:19.160
but any type of danger,
right.

1158
01:08:19.161 --> 01:08:23.900
Gives you this flight or fight response.
So train starts with training,

1159
01:08:24.110 --> 01:08:29.030
Jujitsu,
boxing,
Muay Thai,
wrestling,
shooting,
competing,

1160
01:08:29.031 --> 01:08:32.450
competing,
right.
You get used to those butterflies when you compete,

1161
01:08:32.451 --> 01:08:37.451
you get those butterflies and you get used to him and so train.

1162
01:08:39.430 --> 01:08:40.000
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

1163
01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:43.760
<v 0>And get used to seeing how that reaction,
what that adrenaline feels like and,</v>

1164
01:08:43.930 --> 01:08:47.860
and also get used to understanding what the superior action is.
Right.

1165
01:08:47.890 --> 01:08:51.070
Fight or flight.
Cause sometimes flight is the correct response.

1166
01:08:51.280 --> 01:08:53.470
Sometimes fight is the correct response.

1167
01:08:54.100 --> 01:08:57.910
But what you want to do is you want to be able to assess and dictate which

1168
01:08:57.911 --> 01:09:01.510
response you're going to give and not just do whatever your instinct tells you.

1169
01:09:01.511 --> 01:09:05.080
Cause sometimes your instinct might be wrong.
And so again,

1170
01:09:05.081 --> 01:09:08.870
I don't know what your actually your,
the,

1171
01:09:08.930 --> 01:09:11.170
the situation where you're going into,
but whatever it is,

1172
01:09:11.171 --> 01:09:14.050
cause people get the fight or flight response to,

1173
01:09:14.290 --> 01:09:19.120
to everyday things to like public speaking,
right?
Oh yeah.
Rock climbing.

1174
01:09:19.510 --> 01:09:23.110
Um,
and that's why I say do you know,
do these things,

1175
01:09:25.130 --> 01:09:28.130
training them.
So public speaking,
rock climbing,
you know,

1176
01:09:28.131 --> 01:09:29.110
if you want to get good at rock block,

1177
01:09:29.130 --> 01:09:31.370
like you want to get over that fight or flight response.
When you get up,

1178
01:09:31.430 --> 01:09:35.780
go go rock climbing.
You'll use to it.
You scared of heights,
go start parachuting.

1179
01:09:36.020 --> 01:09:38.870
You know,
you'll get used to it.
You're scared of the water.

1180
01:09:38.871 --> 01:09:42.380
Get worked up and go through swimming and then GIM,

1181
01:09:42.381 --> 01:09:46.310
come scuba certified.
Just the things that you're not comfortable with.

1182
01:09:46.340 --> 01:09:48.800
Get comfortable with being uncomfortable.

1183
01:09:52.240 --> 01:09:52.730
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

1184
01:09:52.730 --> 01:09:56.540
<v 0>While you're doing them too,
while you're doing them,
pay attention.</v>

1185
01:09:57.080 --> 01:10:00.170
You got to detach a little bit.
When these things are,
when you're training,

1186
01:10:00.171 --> 01:10:05.171
detach a little bit and see what is going on your mindset.

1187
01:10:05.870 --> 01:10:09.500
See what red flags that you can see,

1188
01:10:09.501 --> 01:10:12.670
what things will make you aware of the fact that your nerves or your adrenalin

1189
01:10:12.671 --> 01:10:15.890
and you're,
you're,
you feel yourself clenching your fist,
you know?
Okay.

1190
01:10:15.891 --> 01:10:16.641
So cuts my fist.

1191
01:10:16.641 --> 01:10:21.560
Be Aware of it so that you can change it so you can adjust it and put yourself

1192
01:10:21.600 --> 01:10:26.000
again,
put yourself into these scenarios and escalate them so they get harder and

1193
01:10:26.001 --> 01:10:28.130
harder and harder and worse and worse and worse until you're,

1194
01:10:28.730 --> 01:10:31.570
until you start to get control of these things.
Okay.

1195
01:10:32.660 --> 01:10:34.420
<v 2>Here's something weird and they,
it's not weird.</v>

1196
01:10:34.421 --> 01:10:36.880
You're not going to think this is weird,
but um,

1197
01:10:37.210 --> 01:10:42.210
what I used to get super nervous about fight or flight response,

1198
01:10:42.600 --> 01:10:45.580
it was public street,
right?
Yeah.
But that,
that's not worse than that.

1199
01:10:45.581 --> 01:10:47.380
That's not the story.
No,
not worth necessarily,

1200
01:10:47.381 --> 01:10:50.920
but just a different thing is like confrontation,
you know,

1201
01:10:50.921 --> 01:10:55.921
like like hey know whether someone's confronting me or someone or I got to

1202
01:10:57.131 --> 01:11:00.900
confront someone,
you know it's like this barrier.
Yup.

1203
01:11:01.150 --> 01:11:03.460
You know some people they'll just step back and forth that Barry,

1204
01:11:03.461 --> 01:11:06.050
they'll confront you and then go back to just be like,
all right,

1205
01:11:06.051 --> 01:11:09.380
I'm going to go back to work kind of thing or school,
whatever.
But man,

1206
01:11:09.460 --> 01:11:13.410
I've always seen it when I was younger or whatever as this barrier.

1207
01:11:13.411 --> 01:11:14.190
Then it's like

1208
01:11:14.190 --> 01:11:16.590
<v 0>you don't cross it until it's 100% go time.</v>

1209
01:11:16.950 --> 01:11:19.310
So anytime I'm close to the barriers,

1210
01:11:19.320 --> 01:11:21.000
like you get super nervous because it's like Dang,

1211
01:11:21.010 --> 01:11:25.990
is this confrontation mean physical fighting or just in general physical injury.

1212
01:11:26.110 --> 01:11:26.730
Anything.

1213
01:11:26.730 --> 01:11:31.730
Like if something happened with somebody who we're working with and they lost

1214
01:11:33.090 --> 01:11:35.220
something and you had to go confront him on it,

1215
01:11:35.280 --> 01:11:38.340
you that would make you get a fight or flight.
You know how we're just cruising,

1216
01:11:38.490 --> 01:11:40.050
you know,
fully

1217
01:11:42.940 --> 01:11:47.550
and let's say Menier Cruisey I'm saying chocolate and I'm teasing you about

1218
01:11:47.551 --> 01:11:51.870
something and then you liked didn't like something and then he got it went from

1219
01:11:51.871 --> 01:11:54.690
like this to like,
you know what I mean?

1220
01:11:54.750 --> 01:11:56.880
Like you didn't like what I said or something and you're like,
hey,

1221
01:11:56.881 --> 01:12:00.440
I didn't like that.
And it became this thing like,
okay,
yeah,
yeah.

1222
01:12:00.450 --> 01:12:04.860
For what in it's that it's the,
I can be cruising,

1223
01:12:04.980 --> 01:12:09.780
I can be on good terms with someone once it goes bad,
it's like,
to me,

1224
01:12:09.781 --> 01:12:14.781
I just looked at it as this just this huge barrier that,

1225
01:12:15.240 --> 01:12:17.400
so I,
I actually,

1226
01:12:18.660 --> 01:12:23.660
I actually get something like that and for me what it is,

1227
01:12:24.030 --> 01:12:28.200
same thing.
But when,
as soon as I feel it,
you know what I do,

1228
01:12:28.710 --> 01:12:31.850
I go like,
I go,
if I,

1229
01:12:32.860 --> 01:12:37.260
I just default because,
and it sometimes what bothers me sometimes,
you know,

1230
01:12:37.320 --> 01:12:39.450
you don't always have the opportunity.
Like let's say I get an email,

1231
01:12:39.780 --> 01:12:42.750
someone says,
hey,
I really didn't like the way this happened and blah,
blah blah.

1232
01:12:43.170 --> 01:12:46.620
It'll bother me.
And especially it will bother me if someone will say,
Hey,

1233
01:12:46.621 --> 01:12:47.670
when for instance,

1234
01:12:47.671 --> 01:12:52.110
this is the kind of thing that would bother me if someone says,
Hey,
you did this.

1235
01:12:52.650 --> 01:12:56.610
It seemed like you know,
you are putting me down in front of all these people.

1236
01:12:56.670 --> 01:12:59.070
I would feel bad about it.
Right.
And I'd be like,
it would dry.

1237
01:12:59.370 --> 01:13:02.790
And so the only way for me to get over it is I want to talk to them and say,

1238
01:13:02.791 --> 01:13:03.750
hey man,
this is what I did.

1239
01:13:03.750 --> 01:13:06.210
I'm going to send out an email to everyone to make sure that they know that that

1240
01:13:06.211 --> 01:13:08.650
was,
you know,
my wasn't mine.
Don't,
you know,

1241
01:13:08.970 --> 01:13:12.390
say that you did a great job or whatever,
just try and make it right.

1242
01:13:12.450 --> 01:13:14.430
But the only,
all otherwise it just turns,

1243
01:13:14.490 --> 01:13:19.020
it burns me up and I have to confront it.
I the,
the thing that bothers me,

1244
01:13:19.320 --> 01:13:21.510
and I used to like,
I recognize this now when I was younger,

1245
01:13:21.511 --> 01:13:24.570
I might not recognize it.
I would just sit there and I wouldn't know what to do.

1246
01:13:24.571 --> 01:13:27.690
But now I know the solution,
the solution is when something's bothering you,

1247
01:13:28.020 --> 01:13:30.510
you go and you address the problem.
You know,
like my,

1248
01:13:30.810 --> 01:13:34.800
my kids will do something and I'll,
I'll be all angry about it and I just go,
oh,

1249
01:13:34.830 --> 01:13:37.470
what do I need to do is go and talk to them about it.
Hey,
what did you,

1250
01:13:37.471 --> 01:13:41.490
what are you doing?
Why did you do this?
Here's the impact it has on the family.

1251
01:13:41.491 --> 01:13:43.140
Here's the impact it has on your life.

1252
01:13:43.470 --> 01:13:45.750
Here's some other opportunities that you might miss out.

1253
01:13:45.751 --> 01:13:48.000
Now here's some things that you could do better,
or whatever.
You know,

1254
01:13:48.001 --> 01:13:50.130
here's some corrective actions we can take.
Whatever.

1255
01:13:50.160 --> 01:13:52.500
The worst thing I can do is just sit there and hold it inside.
No,

1256
01:13:52.830 --> 01:13:57.110
not a good thing to do.
Yeah.
And I knew that fully.
I mean that,

1257
01:13:57.111 --> 01:14:00.750
that it's not a good thing to do,
but it was just one of the things that,

1258
01:14:00.751 --> 01:14:05.250
that really induced that fight or flight response.
And the strange thing,

1259
01:14:05.251 --> 01:14:08.630
you know what helped a lot,
even just in regular confrontation,
any it,

1260
01:14:08.631 --> 01:14:11.890
it's a specific type of confrontation is not the kind where

1261
01:14:13.090 --> 01:14:13.980
<v 2>you know how like you,</v>

1262
01:14:13.981 --> 01:14:16.630
you say something then you leave and then you think back on,
wait,

1263
01:14:16.631 --> 01:14:19.870
did I insult him?
Bothers me,

1264
01:14:19.930 --> 01:14:23.780
but that to me I'll call you right now.
Okay.

1265
01:14:23.800 --> 01:14:27.820
I said that's no problem.
The kind of its own,
the only kind of stuff,

1266
01:14:27.940 --> 01:14:32.620
the or the only stuff that did it was stuff that to cross this line puts us on

1267
01:14:32.621 --> 01:14:37.530
bad terms temporarily or permanently.
It puts us on like not good terms anyway.

1268
01:14:37.660 --> 01:14:39.880
It was that kind of thing.
But unless,

1269
01:14:39.881 --> 01:14:44.881
you know what totally helped was Jujitsu totally helped where I still don't want

1270
01:14:47.261 --> 01:14:51.940
to,
but if I think that the competition has to go down for whatever reason,

1271
01:14:52.660 --> 01:14:57.640
it's just way easier to do just with just slap,
bump,
roll,
let's do it.

1272
01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:00.340
Kind of a thing,
you know?
But I mean you've got to do a crack.

1273
01:15:00.341 --> 01:15:02.980
You don't feel like you don't lose your temper are going,
I'm going to go in mad.

1274
01:15:02.980 --> 01:15:07.690
You just,
you can address the problem,
but the key isn't about like,

1275
01:15:08.410 --> 01:15:11.670
okay,
I'm good at,
you know,
bringing up in,

1276
01:15:11.671 --> 01:15:14.530
in going through barriers in regards to confrontation.

1277
01:15:14.531 --> 01:15:19.531
It's not that it's that barrier no longer produces that response so I can dance

1278
01:15:19.571 --> 01:15:22.660
up to the barrier.
If it gets cross,
it gets crossed,
you know,

1279
01:15:22.840 --> 01:15:24.850
and it's like whatever.
I'm not nervous about it.

1280
01:15:24.880 --> 01:15:29.440
More comfortable crossing the barrier if need be,
whatever.
Ideally,
yes,

1281
01:15:29.470 --> 01:15:32.200
ideally I'm not going to try to cross the barrier as far as being good terms,

1282
01:15:32.201 --> 01:15:34.890
bad terms.
I'm not going to try golden bed terms anytime,
you know,

1283
01:15:34.891 --> 01:15:36.520
or be impolite or something.
I don't think it's not,

1284
01:15:36.730 --> 01:15:40.360
I mean that's more depends on what kind of person you are I think.
I think,
um,

1285
01:15:40.390 --> 01:15:45.100
but like I said,
the key for me or the,
the,
the element,

1286
01:15:45.101 --> 01:15:46.840
the critical element,
there was that barrier.

1287
01:15:46.840 --> 01:15:50.620
How I felt about being near it or crossing it or not crossing or whatever.
Um,

1288
01:15:50.650 --> 01:15:54.490
it didn't cure it,
but it helps so much ultra.
Okay.
I won't make the story along,

1289
01:15:54.491 --> 01:15:59.320
but that we,
we are all hoping,
actually this was actually after I started.

1290
01:15:59.321 --> 01:16:04.290
You did too,
but just an example.
So I was doing video work for,

1291
01:16:04.690 --> 01:16:09.130
for this guy
and I to say who it doesn't matter.

1292
01:16:09.460 --> 01:16:10.293
Um,

1293
01:16:10.510 --> 01:16:15.070
and he had found out that I was doing other video work.
I Dunno,

1294
01:16:15.071 --> 01:16:16.780
maybe you had a sense of like owner,
I don't know.

1295
01:16:16.940 --> 01:16:20.190
He knew that or he found out or knew that I was doing video for it.

1296
01:16:20.200 --> 01:16:23.320
Not a competitive thing or nothing like that,
but just other video,

1297
01:16:23.321 --> 01:16:24.400
we're kind of like,
hey wait,

1298
01:16:24.401 --> 01:16:27.310
you're not spending all your time on my stuff kind of thing.

1299
01:16:27.640 --> 01:16:31.360
That's what I got the sense of.
But nonetheless,
and it had to do with travel,

1300
01:16:31.450 --> 01:16:33.160
you know,
so I was traveling here and I'm like,
Hey,

1301
01:16:33.161 --> 01:16:35.710
I gotta go cause I have to travel now to this other place.
And it's Kinda like,

1302
01:16:35.770 --> 01:16:39.490
that's where I felt it nonetheless.
So

1303
01:16:41.050 --> 01:16:45.220
the video wasn't due til like this certain date.
And then I was like,
yeah,

1304
01:16:45.221 --> 01:16:47.260
my prediction,
I should have it by this date,

1305
01:16:47.290 --> 01:16:48.850
which was way ahead of the date by the way.

1306
01:16:49.240 --> 01:16:52.690
And then that day I didn't have it and I was like,
Oh,
you know,

1307
01:16:52.720 --> 01:16:56.500
I didn't think it was going to be a big deal because it just didn't seem like a

1308
01:16:56.501 --> 01:16:59.980
big deal.
Your predicted date didn't get there.
It wasn't the due date.
Right,

1309
01:16:59.981 --> 01:17:04.540
right.
Not even.
Yeah.
And then,
um,
so I was like,
oh,

1310
01:17:04.541 --> 01:17:07.000
I don't have it,
you know,
if,
you know,
I've been working on it,
but you know,

1311
01:17:07.030 --> 01:17:10.130
I don't have it.
Maybe tomorrow,
like something like that and the kind of like,

1312
01:17:10.400 --> 01:17:13.220
maybe like one hour I'll have it for you.
It wasn't an hour,

1313
01:17:13.221 --> 01:17:16.880
but it was like all happy to you soon.
And,
and he was like,

1314
01:17:17.600 --> 01:17:20.540
I've thought,
given kind of our history of whatever,
I thought he would be like,

1315
01:17:20.550 --> 01:17:23.060
okay,
well,
cool.
Tomorrow we'll see it tomorrow.

1316
01:17:23.061 --> 01:17:26.130
I'm excited to see it kind of a thing.
That's what I was expecting.
Um,

1317
01:17:26.150 --> 01:17:29.980
but he was like,
he was like,
oh,
okay,
tomorrow.
Uh,
you know,

1318
01:17:30.160 --> 01:17:34.190
I'm really disappointed that you don't have it for me right now.

1319
01:17:34.310 --> 01:17:39.310
And I was really expecting to have to see something and I'm really disappointed

1320
01:17:39.501 --> 01:17:44.340
that you don't have anything for me right now.
And I was like,
boom,
heart beating.

1321
01:17:44.360 --> 01:17:47.130
This is on the phone too,
by the way.
There's not like,
oh,
I was,
you know,

1322
01:17:47.180 --> 01:17:51.950
confronted in anything is just that in pro to the point where I didn't even know

1323
01:17:51.951 --> 01:17:56.120
what to say.
I was like,
I don't even know what I said.

1324
01:17:56.390 --> 01:17:58.850
I think it was just the kind of like,
I didn't say anything and it was like,

1325
01:17:59.130 --> 01:18:00.750
<v 0>so is that maybe one of the,</v>

1326
01:18:00.990 --> 01:18:05.130
one of the things that's caused you to really hold back on making a bunch of

1327
01:18:05.131 --> 01:18:05.964
videos for Johnny

1328
01:18:09.450 --> 01:18:12.570
because there's a bunch of us that want to make that phone call to you.
Well,

1329
01:18:12.571 --> 01:18:16.680
if that was appointed,
just so you know,
we listened to this podcast,

1330
01:18:16.681 --> 01:18:19.000
we're disappointed.
If that were the case,
wouldn't it?

1331
01:18:19.680 --> 01:18:24.090
Wouldn't I be making videos every single day if that were the case?
Well,
I wish,

1332
01:18:24.150 --> 01:18:27.600
well,
what can we do differently over here on our end?
Anyway,
that was the,

1333
01:18:27.870 --> 01:18:28.703
that's an example

1334
01:18:29.250 --> 01:18:32.820
<v 2>because really when I think about it back like that's not a big confrontation.</v>

1335
01:18:34.410 --> 01:18:38.670
Probably had a lot to do with Xq team anyway,
but yeah,
for some reason though,

1336
01:18:38.730 --> 01:18:41.610
generally speaking,
the Jujitsu helped

1337
01:18:43.290 --> 01:18:46.950
as long as you have is you have genuine intentions.
I think,
hey,

1338
01:18:46.951 --> 01:18:49.710
that confrontation is going to come.
Cool.

1339
01:18:51.210 --> 01:18:52.043
Next question.

1340
01:18:54.090 --> 01:18:59.070
The serious question is about question,
indirect approach.

1341
01:19:00.450 --> 01:19:05.220
I have a history of starting things and then giving up on them when I get bored.

1342
01:19:05.760 --> 01:19:07.830
I'm the same way,
by the way,
or anyway.

1343
01:19:11.790 --> 01:19:16.560
A friend of mine is the same.
I'm working on it by sticking with one thing,

1344
01:19:17.310 --> 01:19:19.650
making a website,
which will be done in two weeks.

1345
01:19:20.370 --> 01:19:23.130
I called my friend once a month and he always tells me about some new

1346
01:19:23.131 --> 01:19:25.800
harebrained idea that he never acts on.

1347
01:19:26.400 --> 01:19:30.450
I've tried suggesting that he picked one thing and stick with it,

1348
01:19:30.480 --> 01:19:31.830
but he immediately shuts down.

1349
01:19:32.130 --> 01:19:36.480
How can I take the indirect approach and get him to actually follow through on

1350
01:19:36.481 --> 01:19:41.190
things?
Okay.
So you're trying to help your friend prioritize and execute,
which is

1351
01:19:41.630 --> 01:19:42.230
<v 0>good to go.</v>

1352
01:19:42.230 --> 01:19:45.710
Your friend sounds like he needs to prioritize and execute and get some follow

1353
01:19:45.711 --> 01:19:48.200
through going on with that as well.
I would say this,

1354
01:19:48.201 --> 01:19:49.490
you want to do a little indirect there.

1355
01:19:49.730 --> 01:19:53.030
What I might do with him is get involved in a project with them.
Mike,

1356
01:19:53.031 --> 01:19:54.340
pick one of those when he calls up with a zone,

1357
01:19:54.380 --> 01:19:57.200
these harebrained ideas and you think it's a decent one.
Say Okay Cool,

1358
01:19:57.230 --> 01:19:59.420
let's rock and roll with that.
I want to get in the game

1359
01:20:00.920 --> 01:20:01.753
<v 2>and then</v>

1360
01:20:02.510 --> 01:20:04.940
<v 0>lay out some deadlines like,
Hey,
this is what we need to get done by here.</v>

1361
01:20:04.941 --> 01:20:08.730
This is what we needed to be done by this point.
I'll do these four items.

1362
01:20:08.820 --> 01:20:12.450
You do these four items and that's what we'll get going.
Here's the due date.

1363
01:20:12.451 --> 01:20:16.440
That will get them done by so we can make this launch.
Boom.
Right?

1364
01:20:18.420 --> 01:20:23.250
And then you deliver your end,
you deliver your end and then when he doesn't,

1365
01:20:23.251 --> 01:20:28.230
now you can have a better discussion.
That's not so aggressive.

1366
01:20:28.231 --> 01:20:32.350
You have a reason for it,
you know?
And then,
you know,

1367
01:20:32.400 --> 01:20:34.770
maybe even subtly tell him that you're,
hey,
can I,

1368
01:20:34.771 --> 01:20:37.710
I'm going to go ahead and go proceed further with your idea.
Like I'm,

1369
01:20:37.711 --> 01:20:42.010
you're not going to do it.
It just became my idea.
Right?

1370
01:20:42.340 --> 01:20:47.340
Cause you're not going to execute because he needs to understand that idea.

1371
01:20:48.061 --> 01:20:51.960
People.
That's great.
I'm glad you have a lot of great ideas,
but it doesn't help.

1372
01:20:52.030 --> 01:20:54.840
Doesn't get anything done.
And ideas without executions,

1373
01:20:55.240 --> 01:21:00.150
ideas without execution,
the ideas themselves literally do not exist.

1374
01:21:00.330 --> 01:21:02.280
Your idea is worthless.

1375
01:21:02.340 --> 01:21:05.850
It's totally worthless if you don't execute on it.

1376
01:21:07.020 --> 01:21:07.853
So

1377
01:21:09.540 --> 01:21:14.540
you have to execute the execution of ideas into life.

1378
01:21:15.600 --> 01:21:20.160
Right?
That's what it is.
When you,
when you execute an idea,

1379
01:21:20.190 --> 01:21:23.430
it's creation.
It's not dreaming,

1380
01:21:23.431 --> 01:21:25.590
it's not thinking it's doing.

1381
01:21:25.740 --> 01:21:28.710
You are creating something and that's awesome.

1382
01:21:28.860 --> 01:21:31.440
Like just creation is,

1383
01:21:32.340 --> 01:21:36.600
is an awesome thing to be a part of and it's an awesome thing to lead and to

1384
01:21:36.601 --> 01:21:41.370
take an idea and turn it into something that's real and create and deliver it.

1385
01:21:41.460 --> 01:21:42.293
That's,

1386
01:21:43.060 --> 01:21:43.490
<v 1>yeah,</v>

1387
01:21:43.490 --> 01:21:45.950
<v 0>that's just a hugely rewarding thing in life.</v>

1388
01:21:45.951 --> 01:21:50.180
And he obviously probably hasn't experienced that many times.

1389
01:21:50.720 --> 01:21:53.570
And so how can you let him know that,

1390
01:21:53.900 --> 01:21:58.220
let them know that you know,
ideas mean nothing without execution.

1391
01:21:58.221 --> 01:22:00.800
And our goal is to create something.
And again,

1392
01:22:00.801 --> 01:22:04.460
I think the best way to do it is to join forces with them and drag them along so

1393
01:22:04.461 --> 01:22:08.030
he can get that feeling of the satisfaction of how good it feels to make

1394
01:22:08.031 --> 01:22:08.864
something happen.

1395
01:22:11.730 --> 01:22:14.610
Now the bad news is

1396
01:22:16.290 --> 01:22:20.220
if he doesn't look like if he doesn't do his things,
he doesn't do his part.

1397
01:22:20.221 --> 01:22:24.630
You can coach him,
you can prod them along,
you can do what you can to help him.

1398
01:22:25.590 --> 01:22:29.240
But
eventually you got to go out and make things happen on your own.

1399
01:22:29.300 --> 01:22:33.080
I mean that's just what you gotta do and you can't,
it's very hard.
I can some,

1400
01:22:33.090 --> 01:22:34.490
I can see you can't,
but it's very,

1401
01:22:34.491 --> 01:22:39.491
very difficult to help people that don't want to be helped that don't recognize

1402
01:22:39.741 --> 01:22:41.510
their errors that I've there.
Your Egos too.

1403
01:22:41.570 --> 01:22:43.610
Cause a lot of people that are idea people,
they'll,

1404
01:22:43.611 --> 01:22:46.210
they'll literally tell you that,
you know,
a global idea guy.

1405
01:22:47.060 --> 01:22:51.590
I'm an idea guy is what I do over here.
And,
and you know,
you say,
okay cool,

1406
01:22:51.620 --> 01:22:54.860
I'm gonna go over here and actually make things happen.
So by,
by your ideas.

1407
01:22:55.190 --> 01:22:58.160
So if it's someone that's arrogant like that,
because that's,

1408
01:22:58.161 --> 01:23:02.210
that's a level of arrogance,
right?
Hey,
look,
I don't do this little labor stuff.

1409
01:23:02.450 --> 01:23:06.370
I'm not a guy about execution.
What I do is I have ideas,
brilliance.

1410
01:23:06.880 --> 01:23:10.610
<v 2>That's what I do over here.
That's those people aren't Auger help you.
Yeah.</v>

1411
01:23:10.900 --> 01:23:13.930
So eventually you do what you can to help them out.

1412
01:23:14.230 --> 01:23:16.840
You try and get them involved in some of your projects.
Help.

1413
01:23:16.841 --> 01:23:19.990
Hopefully you can get him all the way through a project where he can see the,

1414
01:23:20.170 --> 01:23:24.820
and feel the gratification of success and execution and creation.

1415
01:23:25.240 --> 01:23:29.920
But if he never tastes that blood,
he's,
he's going to be a vegetarian.

1416
01:23:30.940 --> 01:23:33.310
That's the way it's going to go down.
He's going to be a salad eater.

1417
01:23:33.790 --> 01:23:38.170
And that's not good.
Nothing wrong with eating salads,
by the way.
No.

1418
01:23:38.171 --> 01:23:42.630
I eat salad with steak on them
brought,

1419
01:23:42.631 --> 01:23:46.630
that's so true.
So my brother,
we know him,
Jj,

1420
01:23:46.720 --> 01:23:51.350
he does apps like obviously you know his,
his company,

1421
01:23:51.580 --> 01:23:56.080
they do apps.
So apps,
uh,
let's say,
I'm just saying in general now,
apps,

1422
01:23:56.081 --> 01:24:00.790
websites,
video in my case.
So these are things,
there's other,

1423
01:24:00.850 --> 01:24:02.860
the other industries and skills,
whatever.

1424
01:24:03.100 --> 01:24:06.070
But these are the things that attract to the idea of people.
Hey,

1425
01:24:06.071 --> 01:24:08.560
I got an idea for the,
for the video,
I got an idea for an APP.

1426
01:24:08.830 --> 01:24:13.320
I get an idea for a website,
I've got to eat.
So we,
me and my brother were,

1427
01:24:13.321 --> 01:24:15.450
we attract these people,
right?

1428
01:24:15.460 --> 01:24:18.850
So it's like when you encounter that,

1429
01:24:18.851 --> 01:24:22.840
it's kind of like me saying,
I have an idea for the cure for cancer.

1430
01:24:22.841 --> 01:24:27.841
So what it does is it goes in and it targets just the cancer cells and it leaves

1431
01:24:28.031 --> 01:24:30.880
all the other sales alone.
All of them just leave them alone.

1432
01:24:30.881 --> 01:24:33.820
Just just kills the cancer cells.
So let's say in like,
I don't know,

1433
01:24:33.821 --> 01:24:38.230
a hundred years that happens,
right?
And I'm like,
no bro.
No it wasn't.

1434
01:24:38.710 --> 01:24:42.070
It wasn't here.
I did.
I use,
I mean,
not just like you said,
it's a,
it gets,

1435
01:24:42.610 --> 01:24:44.770
and to say it gets annoying.

1436
01:24:44.770 --> 01:24:48.820
I mean that's kind of maybe not the most accurate way,
for lack of a better term.

1437
01:24:48.821 --> 01:24:53.440
It's real interesting that it's not that clear to people.
You know when,

1438
01:24:53.660 --> 01:24:56.170
if you're,
because the execution is everything.
The idea that,

1439
01:24:56.530 --> 01:24:58.690
I think it might've been Tim Ferriss some,

1440
01:24:58.800 --> 01:25:00.970
so we were saying ideas worth like super,

1441
01:25:00.971 --> 01:25:04.810
like the super small amount all even go further and say it's literally worth

1442
01:25:04.900 --> 01:25:08.920
nothing just like you do.
He's like I said,
I guess there's some granularity of,

1443
01:25:09.350 --> 01:25:13.430
of you know what's weird?
It's,

1444
01:25:13.560 --> 01:25:17.710
it's a dichotomy because the idea is the worthless and at the same time it's the

1445
01:25:17.711 --> 01:25:22.150
most valuable thing but it only gets valued if it gets executed on.

1446
01:25:22.180 --> 01:25:24.150
Otherwise it has zero value.
Yeah.

1447
01:25:24.340 --> 01:25:27.970
And to the execution part execution because here's what you get to,

1448
01:25:27.971 --> 01:25:31.030
and I actually in a way was kind of one of these people where I'd be like why

1449
01:25:31.060 --> 01:25:32.470
have all these cool ideas?

1450
01:25:32.950 --> 01:25:35.590
So the first thing I'm going to do when I get this idea,

1451
01:25:35.591 --> 01:25:40.210
I'm going to go buy the domain name,
right?
I'm going to get,
you know,
sell this,

1452
01:25:40.270 --> 01:25:43.810
you know,
whatever and buy the domain name.
Cause I'm doing,
I'm executing.
Boom,

1453
01:25:43.811 --> 01:25:46.410
step one.
So that,
that's what this guy's doing.
The,
you know,

1454
01:25:46.570 --> 01:25:51.160
this guy who has these ideas and stuff,
this is ready or some form of the domain,

1455
01:25:52.540 --> 01:25:56.290
domain name,
the domain name.
Um,
he might,
you know,

1456
01:25:56.740 --> 01:26:00.670
you might see if the trademark or whatever is,
you know,
taken in all this stuff,

1457
01:26:00.671 --> 01:26:04.200
it would register and you know,
once the,
once the starts you'd be like,
ah,

1458
01:26:04.201 --> 01:26:07.430
well I'm kind of bored.
Right?
Yeah.
That was the think board of that.

1459
01:26:07.760 --> 01:26:12.590
And meanwhile,
like that's usually the fun part.
You know,
the excitement,

1460
01:26:12.620 --> 01:26:15.080
oh I see all the potential,
you know,
all this stuff.

1461
01:26:15.080 --> 01:26:17.180
But when the reality starts hitting and you know,

1462
01:26:17.181 --> 01:26:22.181
the hills get steeper and still the hard work that the actual part of any ideas

1463
01:26:22.531 --> 01:26:26.910
being materialized yet when that comes to view or comes into,
you know,

1464
01:26:26.960 --> 01:26:29.420
into play,
that's when they quote unquote get bored.

1465
01:26:30.530 --> 01:26:34.430
And when you take one,
maybe two steps back,
this,

1466
01:26:34.580 --> 01:26:38.140
it's really clear because
you,

1467
01:26:38.360 --> 01:26:42.770
you consider the percentage of people just in life who are successful in like

1468
01:26:42.830 --> 01:26:44.360
their dream thing.

1469
01:26:44.780 --> 01:26:48.980
I'm a computer programmer and now I own a computer programming business.

1470
01:26:48.981 --> 01:26:50.120
I don't know.
That's my example.

1471
01:26:50.720 --> 01:26:55.720
The amount of people who have that actually happening are really few and

1472
01:26:56.030 --> 01:27:00.110
furthermore you ask any one of those people.

1473
01:27:00.860 --> 01:27:03.650
It was never like I had the idea,
I bought the domain name.

1474
01:27:03.651 --> 01:27:08.030
Three weeks later we were moving.
It's never that.
It's like,
oh my gosh,

1475
01:27:08.060 --> 01:27:12.080
flop on my face.
Fail years.
Decades.
A lot of the time,

1476
01:27:12.230 --> 01:27:16.850
you know it's a grind.
Grind.
Yeah and that and that's all that execution,
right?

1477
01:27:16.851 --> 01:27:21.530
They're executing is hard.
One time I still contact lenses,

1478
01:27:21.531 --> 01:27:24.650
you know the colored contact lenses,
so it's totally illegal.

1479
01:27:24.651 --> 01:27:28.790
I shouldn't have done it.
I imported them from,

1480
01:27:29.300 --> 01:27:30.680
I dunno,
nine important,

1481
01:27:30.681 --> 01:27:33.890
but I bought them from a website where you going back to the values conversation

1482
01:27:33.891 --> 01:27:37.370
with kind of putting people's eyesight at risks and go make a dollar.

1483
01:27:37.400 --> 01:27:40.100
Well they weren't prescription.
They're all good.
You can buy them.

1484
01:27:40.101 --> 01:27:42.800
It was just like,
but nonetheless I bought them and they,

1485
01:27:42.801 --> 01:27:46.970
they'd only take like five days to get here.
So I knew how to make websites,

1486
01:27:46.971 --> 01:27:50.120
I knew how to do all that stuff.
So I just made a website,
colored contact lenses,

1487
01:27:50.121 --> 01:27:52.820
you know,
and I knew about SEL and stuff like that.
I just made the website,

1488
01:27:53.470 --> 01:27:56.150
you know,
eight bucks a month or something,
or a year.

1489
01:27:56.270 --> 01:27:59.510
For the domain website it was free because jade had the platform where you can

1490
01:27:59.511 --> 01:28:02.300
make websites.
So I sold a bunch of contexts.

1491
01:28:02.730 --> 01:28:05.550
Halloween time comes around,
perfect.
SCL,

1492
01:28:05.590 --> 01:28:09.280
call it contact San Diego by him from me.
People would buy them and be like,

1493
01:28:09.300 --> 01:28:11.800
well you buy one and everybody would just buy it from the website comes in and

1494
01:28:11.801 --> 01:28:16.610
just send them to that
execution.
Oh,
so you're,
you're proud of this?

1495
01:28:17.590 --> 01:28:21.530
I am not proud of selling contact.
I'm proud of the execution part.
Good job.

1496
01:28:21.980 --> 01:28:24.320
And then it's sort of got bored,
bored with it.
So.

1497
01:28:26.250 --> 01:28:30.440
All right,
next question.
Let's go to the next question.

1498
01:28:31.580 --> 01:28:34.730
Or this one time
Jocko.

1499
01:28:35.750 --> 01:28:40.610
I was wondering what your opinion was on when to start a child in Jujitsu.

1500
01:28:41.090 --> 01:28:45.650
My daughter was in the game at age seven and I'm on the mats as well.

1501
01:28:46.250 --> 01:28:51.250
My son is three and a half and it has expressed that he's very ready to start as

1502
01:28:51.621 --> 01:28:54.080
well.
My concern is starting him too young,

1503
01:28:54.830 --> 01:28:59.060
him getting crushed and falling out of love with Jujitsu before he has a chance

1504
01:28:59.061 --> 01:29:02.370
to fall in love with it.
This is the romance.

1505
01:29:02.650 --> 01:29:05.310
<v 3>So,
uh,
okay.</v>

1506
01:29:05.370 --> 01:29:08.790
So completely dependent on the maturity of the kid.
Yeah.

1507
01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:10.730
And um,

1508
01:29:11.760 --> 01:29:14.700
how old was your daughter when she started training to,

1509
01:29:15.180 --> 01:29:19.710
to I'll tell you about the circumstances.
No,
two to straight up too.

1510
01:29:19.890 --> 01:29:23.130
She,
she's really mature,

1511
01:29:23.760 --> 01:29:28.110
really smart and athletic and durable.

1512
01:29:28.170 --> 01:29:32.940
So that's,
that's like as young as you're going to get.
Yeah.
Um,

1513
01:29:33.240 --> 01:29:35.670
and,
and what,
what,

1514
01:29:36.100 --> 01:29:40.560
how many times a week would you go to and was there other small children in the

1515
01:29:40.561 --> 01:29:42.750
class?
Yes.
You had some kind of an ret,

1516
01:29:42.751 --> 01:29:45.170
you knew somebody that was all springing their kid or something like that.

1517
01:29:45.330 --> 01:29:47.700
They had a good playmate in there.
I need to make,

1518
01:29:48.030 --> 01:29:52.110
it's kind of a long all I'll tell you about it for sure.
Um,

1519
01:29:53.190 --> 01:29:57.440
basically it's,
uh,
you don't,
Matt Becker and them,
it's uh,

1520
01:29:57.630 --> 01:30:02.250
it's Gracie certified training center.
Yes.
It's a smaller gym,

1521
01:30:02.251 --> 01:30:04.170
but so you know,

1522
01:30:04.171 --> 01:30:09.171
they have programs for younger kids or whatever and it's essentially like you

1523
01:30:10.230 --> 01:30:14.490
modify the young kids wrote,
which is like for playing,
it's playing.

1524
01:30:14.490 --> 01:30:17.760
That's what it is.
But here's the thing you learned,
you did some moves for sure.

1525
01:30:17.830 --> 01:30:21.160
And in there you'll say you'll teach them that this is Jujitsu.

1526
01:30:21.210 --> 01:30:25.180
They don't know that you're there.
They're going to the person down.

1527
01:30:25.440 --> 01:30:27.150
They know that it's a mount in their thinking.

1528
01:30:27.151 --> 01:30:28.200
They're going trying to get out of the mountain.

1529
01:30:28.310 --> 01:30:31.380
They just think they're just trying to get off the bottom and they have games

1530
01:30:31.381 --> 01:30:34.300
where you balance on stuff and it works on their balance.
And you had these,

1531
01:30:34.380 --> 01:30:36.500
you know the myths that you hit point to him.

1532
01:30:36.960 --> 01:30:39.600
They line them up and you get to for sure walking on the boat.

1533
01:30:39.601 --> 01:30:42.810
So they play all these games.
But it's crazy how like,

1534
01:30:43.110 --> 01:30:44.700
it's like karate kid man,

1535
01:30:44.790 --> 01:30:47.670
you don't want to cry again when it's like sand the wax on wax off in there and

1536
01:30:47.671 --> 01:30:50.520
they get good at the wax on,
wax off cause it's kind of fun.
Well wax on,

1537
01:30:50.521 --> 01:30:52.950
wax off from that fun.
But the stuff you do in there is fun.

1538
01:30:53.280 --> 01:30:55.880
And then when they're like,
okay,
who?
And it's really you,

1539
01:30:56.210 --> 01:31:00.240
you got to find the right person.
The right teacher has been mad,
but he was like,

1540
01:31:00.360 --> 01:31:05.360
he's so gentle kids because there's other young kids running around,

1541
01:31:05.910 --> 01:31:07.740
you know,
they're not,
he knows.

1542
01:31:07.741 --> 01:31:09.420
He knows not everyone's going to be paying attention.

1543
01:31:10.380 --> 01:31:15.300
And so they got to know how to deal with kids.
But yeah,

1544
01:31:15.301 --> 01:31:17.900
man,
she,
she took it and who was it was good.
Yeah.
And,

1545
01:31:18.040 --> 01:31:21.210
and there's some kids that are 11 and 12 years old that aren't ready for
Jujitsu.

1546
01:31:21.240 --> 01:31:22.770
Yeah.
They're just not there yet.

1547
01:31:23.280 --> 01:31:28.280
And I would also say less is more for a young kid.

1548
01:31:28.621 --> 01:31:31.580
You know,
you don't want to just burn them out.
Don't smoke them on that everyday.

1549
01:31:31.620 --> 01:31:34.680
Make 'em look forward,
pull them off the mat.
They want to stay a little longer.

1550
01:31:34.681 --> 01:31:37.870
Hey,
we got to go.
I mean,
you won't let them have some fun,
but,
um,

1551
01:31:38.100 --> 01:31:41.070
I burned my kids out.
Yeah,
man.
Um,

1552
01:31:41.940 --> 01:31:46.440
and I backed off in time for my son because he was younger and it didn't cause

1553
01:31:46.441 --> 01:31:51.390
my,
my daughters,
I was like,
compete,
train,
compete,
train,
compete.
Oh,

1554
01:31:51.570 --> 01:31:54.720
I'm going to put you in the heavier weight class.
The older kids bracket.

1555
01:31:54.721 --> 01:31:58.710
I mean I just did it wrong,
right?
Just did it wrong and,

1556
01:31:59.380 --> 01:32:00.130
and I didn't

1557
01:32:00.130 --> 01:32:02.910
<v 0>back off in time.
And so now they train,
you know,</v>

1558
01:32:02.940 --> 01:32:07.090
I mean not as much as they should.
Right.
My son turns all the time.

1559
01:32:07.580 --> 01:32:12.060
Um,
but I did a bad job of making Jujitsu fun.
Right.
Cause that's,

1560
01:32:12.080 --> 01:32:15.220
and that's what,
you know,
that's why I like you.
The fact that this question,

1561
01:32:15.400 --> 01:32:18.190
he said,
am I starting with two younger?
He's going to get crushed.
Hey,

1562
01:32:18.220 --> 01:32:19.780
you shouldn't,
you know,
Jim,

1563
01:32:19.781 --> 01:32:22.060
that you take your three and a half year old child to,

1564
01:32:22.210 --> 01:32:26.680
should be allowing him to get crushed.
That shouldn't be happening.

1565
01:32:26.980 --> 01:32:31.480
So if you have a good gym where you've got the right instructor,
um,

1566
01:32:32.650 --> 01:32:36.920
that then go and let them have fun and make sure it just stays fun in any,

1567
01:32:36.930 --> 01:32:40.510
if they don't love it,
you,
you can't make them love it.
It's not going to happen.

1568
01:32:40.511 --> 01:32:41.530
Now this is a good story.

1569
01:32:41.680 --> 01:32:46.660
One of my son's friends who I always want all everyone to turn to do it through

1570
01:32:46.661 --> 01:32:48.350
obviously what this guy is,

1571
01:32:48.370 --> 01:32:51.520
a friend of mine I've known for a long time and his has a son that's my son's

1572
01:32:51.521 --> 01:32:54.190
age.
And so they kind of grown up together and you know,

1573
01:32:54.191 --> 01:32:56.680
my son's always train in Jujitsu and I would say,
hey,
you know,

1574
01:32:56.681 --> 01:32:59.650
when they were six years old,
hey,
have your son come in and try it.

1575
01:33:00.110 --> 01:33:04.240
Came in and tried it.
One to hate it.
Hm.
Year later now,
you know,

1576
01:33:04.241 --> 01:33:07.300
a year and I don't know,
something like that.
13 months,
18 months or something.

1577
01:33:07.890 --> 01:33:12.370
It comes in a year later,
tries it again.
He's like now seven years old.
Hates it.

1578
01:33:12.650 --> 01:33:14.620
Just doesn't like it.
Can't stand it.

1579
01:33:15.850 --> 01:33:20.680
Then comes in at,
you know,
nine years old,
comes in,

1580
01:33:21.340 --> 01:33:24.060
loves it.
I'm turning to everyday now.
Do you know what mean?

1581
01:33:24.070 --> 01:33:27.070
Trans all the time and,
and you know,
now he's my,
and,
and,

1582
01:33:27.080 --> 01:33:28.180
and they'll tell you what this is,

1583
01:33:28.181 --> 01:33:32.410
what's cool is that he's,

1584
01:33:34.080 --> 01:33:37.300
it's not like he's a million years.
It's not so,

1585
01:33:37.310 --> 01:33:41.770
so my son trained three years more or maybe even four years more than,

1586
01:33:41.800 --> 01:33:42.640
than this other kid.

1587
01:33:43.180 --> 01:33:47.620
My son is that kid caught up.
Right?
I mean,

1588
01:33:47.890 --> 01:33:50.020
my son is still a little bit bit,
but a little bit better,

1589
01:33:50.021 --> 01:33:54.520
but they're in the same game right there.
It's not like,
it's not like that.

1590
01:33:54.690 --> 01:33:59.200
My son has this massive lead.
No,
the kid loves it and you can learn,

1591
01:33:59.680 --> 01:34:04.390
you can learn and get better,
you know,
at any age.

1592
01:34:04.420 --> 01:34:09.130
But my point in saying that is forcing him to be in it for those three years

1593
01:34:09.580 --> 01:34:13.320
would not have helped.
He would've,
he would've quit Jujitsu completely,

1594
01:34:13.600 --> 01:34:16.210
but just haven't shown it to them and saying,
Hey,
this is what you do.

1595
01:34:16.210 --> 01:34:19.210
And you know,
he didn't like getting choked.
Right.
And,

1596
01:34:19.240 --> 01:34:22.840
and maybe that's me.
It was my buddy's son.
So,
hey,
let's,

1597
01:34:22.841 --> 01:34:25.420
let's get after it a little bit.
And then we weren't letting them get chokes,

1598
01:34:25.421 --> 01:34:27.700
but he just didn't like the Claustrophobia of it.

1599
01:34:27.701 --> 01:34:30.900
Right in there is claustrophobia.
You're gonna feel that even in,

1600
01:34:30.970 --> 01:34:33.970
even in a gentle situation with a six year old,
if you get held down,

1601
01:34:33.971 --> 01:34:36.550
you don't like it.
You know,
he didn't like it.
Yeah.

1602
01:34:36.640 --> 01:34:41.030
Now he's holding people down himself.
So you,
you,

1603
01:34:41.031 --> 01:34:46.030
you basically what I'm saying is forcing someone to a kid to do something for

1604
01:34:46.031 --> 01:34:49.600
two years.
You think you're getting this value,
two years worth of value.

1605
01:34:49.601 --> 01:34:51.340
You're not getting two years worth of value.

1606
01:34:51.400 --> 01:34:53.200
You're actually going though direction.

1607
01:34:53.380 --> 01:34:56.050
So you might as well just let them try it occasionally.

1608
01:34:56.140 --> 01:34:58.040
And I say that sometimes will

1609
01:34:58.100 --> 01:35:01.640
<v 3>at my gym,
they'll,
hey,
you know,
my son just doesn't want to do it right now.</v>

1610
01:35:01.700 --> 01:35:04.490
And I go,
no problem.
Hey,
you know what I say?
They say,

1611
01:35:04.580 --> 01:35:07.340
I just want to make them call and go,
don't make him come.
I go,

1612
01:35:07.460 --> 01:35:10.600
don't make him come.
Let him come.
When he wants to you,
you'd,

1613
01:35:10.690 --> 01:35:12.170
you're gonna stop your membership.
That's cool.

1614
01:35:12.200 --> 01:35:14.390
If he wants to come in on Saturdays and bring him in,
you know,

1615
01:35:14.391 --> 01:35:18.980
he wants to come in once,
you know,
once a month to just do,
keep him familiar.

1616
01:35:19.370 --> 01:35:21.230
Do that.
Just do that.

1617
01:35:21.590 --> 01:35:26.590
You don't grind their brains out when they're whatever little kids,

1618
01:35:27.650 --> 01:35:31.270
big kids.
I think
you know how

1619
01:35:32.810 --> 01:35:35.150
you say like did you two should be fun.
So the

1620
01:35:37.850 --> 01:35:42.060
if,
okay,
so,
okay,
you're watching a Bronx tale,
your bullets that,
okay.

1621
01:35:42.340 --> 01:35:45.740
There's a part on that where we're a,
you know these biker guys,

1622
01:35:45.770 --> 01:35:49.700
they're in the bar,
you know,
causing trouble.
Exactly right.
So that's what it is.

1623
01:35:49.701 --> 01:35:51.560
And this is what,
this is what this guy got to be here.
Okay.

1624
01:35:51.561 --> 01:35:53.720
So for those who've never seen Bronxdale,

1625
01:35:53.870 --> 01:35:56.840
these biker guys are in the bar and they're like causing trouble and all this

1626
01:35:56.841 --> 01:35:59.300
stuff.
And,
and then the people that,
hey,

1627
01:35:59.330 --> 01:36:02.420
you guys please a mobsters now mobsters say,
hey guys,
please leave.

1628
01:36:02.450 --> 01:36:04.640
You need to get out of here.
And they're like,
hey,
we'll do whatever we want.

1629
01:36:04.641 --> 01:36:08.820
And he's like,
no,
no.
They're like,
okay,
we'll leave.
Let me get one beer in.

1630
01:36:08.830 --> 01:36:11.090
The Guy said,
all right,
one more beer.
And they grabbed the beer in these,

1631
01:36:11.091 --> 01:36:13.460
shake the beer all over it.
And then now this stuff.
So anyway,

1632
01:36:13.550 --> 01:36:15.470
they locked the doors and say,
hey,
we asked you to leave.

1633
01:36:15.500 --> 01:36:20.320
Now you can't leave bad situation for the biker.
So this is what,

1634
01:36:20.830 --> 01:36:23.960
in my opinion,
and this guy has to avoid.
Like if his son three and a half,

1635
01:36:23.990 --> 01:36:25.310
it's like Dang,
I'm showing interest.

1636
01:36:25.311 --> 01:36:28.570
I want to get kind of get on the mats on a jump in here,
I see what's going on.

1637
01:36:28.580 --> 01:36:30.830
It looks like fun.
I'm gonna jump in,
don't be like,
Hey,

1638
01:36:31.820 --> 01:36:35.120
you want to get in now you can't leave.
Don't do that kind of stuff.

1639
01:36:35.360 --> 01:36:38.900
Do I leave the door open right to yes,
exactly.
So as you know,

1640
01:36:38.930 --> 01:36:43.130
press three and a half now where she went to Matt Becker's for awhile and

1641
01:36:43.131 --> 01:36:44.720
learned it and it was cool.

1642
01:36:44.900 --> 01:36:48.740
And now I just bring her with me just once a week.

1643
01:36:48.860 --> 01:36:52.370
When I go on Fridays or whatever.
Um,
he,
I'd bring her with me.

1644
01:36:52.490 --> 01:36:55.820
I don't tell her jumping in the class and just come be familiar with the mat to

1645
01:36:55.821 --> 01:36:59.780
sit dead ruling.
You see Jocko rural and you see Andy,
you know,
and she has fun.

1646
01:36:59.780 --> 01:37:02.260
They want to talk to you and she's pretty outgoing.
She has flattened out now.

1647
01:37:02.270 --> 01:37:05.590
She just likes that the message is fun.
You don't have to worry.
She,
he,

1648
01:37:05.591 --> 01:37:09.810
she hangs with them.
She coaches you.
Crystal son is there.
Yeah.
She,

1649
01:37:09.811 --> 01:37:11.900
she cheers for me.
Yeah.
But you know,

1650
01:37:11.901 --> 01:37:15.770
crystal son is their favorite Jujitsu guy though.
I know.
I think it was Andy.

1651
01:37:16.060 --> 01:37:20.360
Yeah,
sorry.
Oh,
so you know,
so she likes it.
She's familiar.

1652
01:37:20.420 --> 01:37:25.370
Familiar.
I'm not going to say,
hey,
we're here,
so we got to get our reps today.
No,

1653
01:37:25.371 --> 01:37:29.000
it's not that when she wants to come like Molly and she will,
she'll be like,
Hey,

1654
01:37:29.060 --> 01:37:32.900
I'll let me show this guy.
There was,
um,
I forget his name,
but he's like,
Hey,

1655
01:37:32.901 --> 01:37:36.030
let me show him out.
And there's this whole series that she learned from my,

1656
01:37:36.070 --> 01:37:38.450
you know,
like finding the arms and keeping the balance,
all this stuff.

1657
01:37:38.990 --> 01:37:43.340
And she likes to do it,
you know,
so now she always wants to go.
There you go.

1658
01:37:43.370 --> 01:37:46.640
And when and at,
at home or whatever,
one,
you know,
my mom comes and visits,

1659
01:37:46.641 --> 01:37:49.580
she's like,
Hey,
let me show grandma came out and she wants to do it,
you know?

1660
01:37:49.610 --> 01:37:51.890
Beautiful.
And yeah,
so that'll keep her in the game.

1661
01:37:51.950 --> 01:37:54.630
And when she starts getting a lot more ability,
you know,

1662
01:37:54.750 --> 01:37:58.560
age like three and a half,
Nelson like let's take four or five,
six,
seven,
yeah,

1663
01:37:58.710 --> 01:38:03.360
she's going to start to realize,
oh shoot,
I can do this stuff now.
You know,

1664
01:38:03.361 --> 01:38:06.690
because all these little things that I learned just by playing around really.

1665
01:38:07.320 --> 01:38:10.380
And that's kind of what you want with that.
But if it's,
if they look at it,

1666
01:38:10.381 --> 01:38:13.890
this thing that my dad forced me to do it so hard and claustrophobic,
Yep.

1667
01:38:14.100 --> 01:38:17.700
Guys sweating on me and I'm losing the whole time cause they just started and

1668
01:38:17.701 --> 01:38:22.350
I'm rolling with Thor the whole time and he's,
you know,
killing me or whatever.

1669
01:38:22.680 --> 01:38:26.070
And that's my experience.
My whole regard for the Jujitsu is going to be like,

1670
01:38:26.160 --> 01:38:29.970
yeah,
this isn't fun.
There's also a little bit of rebellion in all,

1671
01:38:30.060 --> 01:38:33.480
in most children in like my,
one of my daughters,

1672
01:38:34.080 --> 01:38:37.530
she doesn't want to train Jujitsu,
but she wrestles in high school,

1673
01:38:39.250 --> 01:38:43.380
so that's awesome.
I think that's an exam,
but she almost does that just to be,

1674
01:38:43.381 --> 01:38:48.300
you know.
No,
I wrestle a little.
Does she know she got flagged?

1675
01:38:49.290 --> 01:38:50.400
She got flanked,

1676
01:38:54.900 --> 01:38:59.440
but yeah,
man,
I think so.
I mean,
back to the question,
I think that um,

1677
01:39:01.070 --> 01:39:04.890
they're given a certain type of teacher,

1678
01:39:05.700 --> 01:39:10.360
which I mean the demands on the teacher for,
you know,
a young Ian's courier.
Yeah.

1679
01:39:10.410 --> 01:39:13.410
It's so hard.
So you gotta it's rare to find a teacher,

1680
01:39:13.411 --> 01:39:17.280
especially if you have a teacher who doesn't like do that,
you know,
if it's like,

1681
01:39:17.281 --> 01:39:19.950
okay,
I'm going to make an exception for this.
Cause I seen guys,

1682
01:39:20.220 --> 01:39:22.500
they're comfortable,
their friends in the gym kind of thing and they're like,

1683
01:39:22.501 --> 01:39:25.320
yeah,
my kids do,
but we all like each other.
Right?
Then,
hey,

1684
01:39:25.321 --> 01:39:26.910
jump in the kids class,
he's two,

1685
01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:30.120
he's running around and he's interrupting the class.
Like,
yeah,
it's not,

1686
01:39:30.121 --> 01:39:32.010
it's not good if the kid's not ready.
And the teacher,

1687
01:39:32.040 --> 01:39:35.850
that's not a compatible situation up.
This kid's not ready.
We'll say,
hey,

1688
01:39:35.910 --> 01:39:38.820
your kid's not ready.
Yeah,
you can't.
You can't be in here.
Yeah,

1689
01:39:38.880 --> 01:39:42.090
come back in six months.
You want to bring them in and we'll watch on Saturdays.

1690
01:39:42.300 --> 01:39:45.390
Cool.
Good.
How familiar you do you bring them in to watch?

1691
01:39:45.540 --> 01:39:50.430
It's the time we're going,
you know?
Hopefully he's not disruptive.
Hopefully.

1692
01:39:50.700 --> 01:39:53.280
Well,
they can't be disruptive or they can't stay.
Right,
right,
right.

1693
01:39:53.281 --> 01:39:57.030
You can't do that.
Yeah,
yeah.
Well,
yeah,
so in that case,
you know,

1694
01:39:57.031 --> 01:40:00.930
it's not going to work,
but uh,
yeah.
That's it.
Just like how you said,

1695
01:40:00.931 --> 01:40:04.560
just open the door.
I'm cruising in here.
It'll look to see if the door's open.

1696
01:40:04.561 --> 01:40:06.860
I'm cruising here.
I'm doing fun stuff.
Come on in.

1697
01:40:07.680 --> 01:40:10.620
I'm not going to close the door.
I'm not going to go a Bronx tale on you.

1698
01:40:10.920 --> 01:40:15.420
You know?
That's how you do it.
My opinion
check.

1699
01:40:15.590 --> 01:40:20.580
All right.
When we got time for one more.
Yeah.
Okay,
cool.

1700
01:40:22.440 --> 01:40:24.150
Have you most,
okay,
Jocko.

1701
01:40:25.290 --> 01:40:29.550
I have mostly lived a life dominated by doubt and fear.

1702
01:40:30.690 --> 01:40:35.640
What are your thoughts on how I can step into bravery?
You know what?

1703
01:40:35.740 --> 01:40:40.740
I actually took this question from Twitter and I answered the question in one

1704
01:40:42.141 --> 01:40:42.974
word.

1705
01:40:45.520 --> 01:40:49.000
You've lived a life dominated by doubt and fear.

1706
01:40:49.240 --> 01:40:51.700
How do you step into bravery?

1707
01:40:56.490 --> 01:40:57.323
<v 1>Yep.</v>

1708
01:40:59.290 --> 01:41:04.180
<v 3>That that's how you step into bravery step.
Take the step</v>

1709
01:41:05.850 --> 01:41:10.850
step aggressively towards your fear and that that step towards your fear is the

1710
01:41:15.931 --> 01:41:17.370
step into bravery

1711
01:41:19.860 --> 01:41:24.240
because we're scared of what we don't know.

1712
01:41:26.110 --> 01:41:26.943
<v 1>And</v>

1713
01:41:28.050 --> 01:41:33.050
<v 3>there is only one way to learn and to know and that is to confront that fear.</v>

1714
01:41:36.420 --> 01:41:40.830
You have to step,
you have to go.
And this simple action,

1715
01:41:42.300 --> 01:41:43.710
simple attitude.

1716
01:41:45.730 --> 01:41:49.360
It answers so many questions.

1717
01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:52.110
So many questions.

1718
01:41:54.470 --> 01:41:57.620
How do you get to the gym every day

1719
01:41:59.760 --> 01:42:03.540
you step,
you go,
how do you,
how do you change your diet?

1720
01:42:04.800 --> 01:42:05.633
<v 1>Do step</v>

1721
01:42:06.330 --> 01:42:10.530
<v 3>you go,
how do you overcome fear of failure?</v>

1722
01:42:10.560 --> 01:42:14.100
Fear of success or,
or fear of fear itself.

1723
01:42:16.960 --> 01:42:17.793
<v 1>You step</v>

1724
01:42:20.120 --> 01:42:23.750
<v 3>and how do you face the fear of the unknown?
You step.</v>

1725
01:42:24.050 --> 01:42:27.740
Don't wait anymore.
Don't think anymore.
Don't plan anymore.

1726
01:42:27.741 --> 01:42:29.510
Don't contemplate anymore.

1727
01:42:29.900 --> 01:42:34.130
Don't make any more excuses or justifications.

1728
01:42:35.310 --> 01:42:39.030
Don't rationalize anything else.
No,

1729
01:42:39.870 --> 01:42:41.550
no and no.

1730
01:42:44.700 --> 01:42:47.720
Instead be aggressive.

1731
01:42:47.970 --> 01:42:49.730
Take Action now.

1732
01:42:49.790 --> 01:42:53.930
And what is the first action that you need to take?

1733
01:42:55.460 --> 01:42:58.280
What's the first step you need to take?

1734
01:43:01.570 --> 01:43:05.650
The first step you need to take is just that

1735
01:43:08.690 --> 01:43:09.523
<v 1>step.</v>

1736
01:43:16.160 --> 01:43:20.060
<v 3>And I think that's
all I've got for tonight.</v>

1737
01:43:21.320 --> 01:43:25.010
So
speaking of stepping

1738
01:43:27.410 --> 01:43:28.310
echo,
Charles,

1739
01:43:28.730 --> 01:43:33.730
if somebody wanted to step up and support this podcast,

1740
01:43:34.910 --> 01:43:39.470
what would be a good step in making that happen?

1741
01:43:39.860 --> 01:43:41.420
Okay,
before we go into that,

1742
01:43:42.380 --> 01:43:43.213
<v 1>good day today</v>

1743
01:43:45.210 --> 01:43:48.570
<v 3>where your bars came in.
I mentioned,</v>

1744
01:43:48.840 --> 01:43:51.890
I tried the Jalapeno one anyway,
came in today.

1745
01:43:52.790 --> 01:43:56.810
<v 2>Outstanding.
Um,
I've been,
you know,
this,</v>

1746
01:43:56.811 --> 01:43:59.510
I've been Kinda Kinda off had the stomach flu,

1747
01:44:00.320 --> 01:44:03.660
two Mris on my knee to see what up to knees,
you know,

1748
01:44:03.740 --> 01:44:06.170
so I kind of been out of the game two weeks out of the game.

1749
01:44:06.710 --> 01:44:10.550
Today was my first day back in the game.
First Day back in the game,

1750
01:44:11.210 --> 01:44:14.840
did a metcon,
lifted some weights,
didn't do these huge budgets yet,

1751
01:44:15.290 --> 01:44:18.650
but um,
yeah,
fully functional.

1752
01:44:18.800 --> 01:44:22.160
All good life.
That's meaning again.

1753
01:44:22.490 --> 01:44:26.870
Then the warrior bars coming.
Good day for Echo Charles.
Great Day.
Um,

1754
01:44:27.650 --> 01:44:30.920
where are your bars on it or your births when we talk about this before.

1755
01:44:30.980 --> 01:44:34.460
So right back to the supporting of the podcasting.
I know you're like,

1756
01:44:34.461 --> 01:44:38.000
what does that have to do with support in the podcast?
So on it worry is on,

1757
01:44:38.001 --> 01:44:41.630
it is supplements.
I remember back in the day

1758
01:44:44.630 --> 01:44:48.020
when I first,
not first but me a few years into lifting,
you know,
people,

1759
01:44:48.021 --> 01:44:52.400
they'll just get supplements,
right?
Joe Wieder super weight gain.
2000.

1760
01:44:52.520 --> 01:44:57.060
Exactly.
Waking 2000,
you know,
all the Beta Gin,
fossil,
the gin,

1761
01:44:58.340 --> 01:45:01.970
creatine,
you know,
even though apparently creatine is good thing.
Anyway,
I,

1762
01:45:02.450 --> 01:45:06.500
for Real,
I found that supplements,
no supplements,
no factor.

1763
01:45:06.530 --> 01:45:07.730
It doesn't even make a difference.

1764
01:45:07.880 --> 01:45:10.790
Like when I was on supplements like Weight Gainer,

1765
01:45:10.850 --> 01:45:13.880
I didn't gain a bunch of weight no more than it would without the supplements.

1766
01:45:13.940 --> 01:45:14.773
Anyway,

1767
01:45:14.870 --> 01:45:18.950
the point there is supplements are whack in my opinion.

1768
01:45:19.850 --> 01:45:24.290
And what I found out that you focus on the wrong thing on as far as

1769
01:45:24.291 --> 01:45:26.750
supplementation goes,
it's going to be whacked.

1770
01:45:26.751 --> 01:45:31.751
So on it.com/jocko/jacket because that's where the 10% off.

1771
01:45:33.441 --> 01:45:37.370
But I'm going to get to that.
Don't worry.

1772
01:45:37.371 --> 01:45:39.020
This has to do with supporting the podcast.
So,

1773
01:45:39.410 --> 01:45:43.040
so on it they have the correct supplements and not only the correct supplements,

1774
01:45:43.100 --> 01:45:47.240
the good co,
because supplements don't have to be anything.
They don't have to be,

1775
01:45:47.320 --> 01:45:48.380
you have chopped pills.

1776
01:45:48.400 --> 01:45:52.370
I mean we really increase your mood and I dunno whenever increasing your weight

1777
01:45:52.371 --> 01:45:56.630
gain,
whatever.
But these are like legit and one of the few anyway.

1778
01:45:56.690 --> 01:46:00.920
And okay,
so if you want to supplement something,
don't get like weight gainers.

1779
01:46:01.340 --> 01:46:03.650
You know,
if you want to gain weight,

1780
01:46:03.680 --> 01:46:06.620
you can do that in the correct way without supplements.

1781
01:46:06.800 --> 01:46:10.040
This is what you supplement,
what you know,
as you wear and tear your joints,

1782
01:46:10.041 --> 01:46:13.040
your joints don't get much blood flow like compared to muscles.

1783
01:46:13.160 --> 01:46:15.980
So they tend to get more wear and tear with less.

1784
01:46:15.981 --> 01:46:17.750
Like as far as speedy recovery goes,

1785
01:46:17.780 --> 01:46:20.360
your muscle recover quicker than your joints.
That's what I'm saying.
You know,

1786
01:46:20.370 --> 01:46:22.940
supplement something.
It's a little bit that,
that needs supplementation.

1787
01:46:22.941 --> 01:46:27.910
If you're getting after it.
Krill oil,
that was a big lead in,
um,

1788
01:46:28.640 --> 01:46:33.380
look,
I could say take Krill oil.
It'll help your joints.
You're like,

1789
01:46:33.381 --> 01:46:36.580
okay,
you know,
because every commercial or every word,

1790
01:46:36.620 --> 01:46:40.670
there'll be ready to take this little help this you need like some contact

1791
01:46:40.820 --> 01:46:45.820
context and like the information that kind of backs it up,

1792
01:46:47.570 --> 01:46:49.770
you know,
it got to be real and this is real.

1793
01:46:50.640 --> 01:46:51.090
<v 3>Nonetheless.</v>

1794
01:46:51.090 --> 01:46:56.090
Krill oil is one of the supplements that I recommend for your joints.

1795
01:46:56.500 --> 01:47:00.180
I told the story about how when I get out of bed and I'd be like all jacked up

1796
01:47:00.270 --> 01:47:02.520
because my daughter wouldn't jump on my back right out of bed.
You're like,

1797
01:47:02.730 --> 01:47:06.180
you got a warm up for that kind of stuff.
Typically,
but not,
not anymore.

1798
01:47:06.290 --> 01:47:09.210
Cause I had been on the Krill oil strong bone by the way,

1799
01:47:09.390 --> 01:47:14.160
for your joints as well.
It's not strong bones strong.
Strawn boom.

1800
01:47:14.320 --> 01:47:17.340
Yeah.
I don't know the uh,
I don't know the reason for that.

1801
01:47:17.780 --> 01:47:21.720
It's just dope like that if you're looking for it.
No.
Gee,
that's John.

1802
01:47:22.050 --> 01:47:25.830
That's for joints and stuff.
Uh,
what else did you say?
Oh,
Alpha brain of course.

1803
01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:29.940
So the point behind all this deck,
shroom tech,

1804
01:47:31.110 --> 01:47:34.860
here's what shroom tech does.
I think everybody knows what it does.

1805
01:47:34.890 --> 01:47:37.230
Here's the thing.
I don't think so.
I be like,
Hey,

1806
01:47:37.260 --> 01:47:40.860
it makes you get after it for longer or whatever.
Listen to podcasts.

1807
01:47:41.190 --> 01:47:43.800
Every time we say what is from tech knows,
I'm going to clarify.

1808
01:47:43.890 --> 01:47:48.540
I'm going to clarify.
Okay.
You know what?
Go for it.
You know what?
Unless it back.

1809
01:47:48.570 --> 01:47:49.403
Okay.

1810
01:47:49.830 --> 01:47:54.720
Clarify to clarify it to you and just agree or disagree if this is correct.

1811
01:47:54.960 --> 01:47:59.250
Okay,
so I don't even have to use scientific terms.
I'm just put into perspective.

1812
01:47:59.251 --> 01:48:03.730
So if I'm gonna own it,
it's not,
I'm not an none of that.

1813
01:48:04.250 --> 01:48:07.350
You haven't had enough alpha brain do scientific terms right now.

1814
01:48:07.740 --> 01:48:12.240
So just use whatever terms.
Okay,
I'm going to do a metcon.

1815
01:48:12.310 --> 01:48:14.130
They'd use them quickly.
They do in that car,

1816
01:48:14.280 --> 01:48:17.400
I'm going to do like 10 rounds did you did to five rounds and used to whatever.

1817
01:48:19.380 --> 01:48:23.970
If I'm not on shroom tech sport,
by the way,
this tomb tech immune as well,

1818
01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:27.810
but she takes words so it helps you like utilize oxygen.

1819
01:48:27.810 --> 01:48:30.930
So what that means is when you hit the,
you know when you,

1820
01:48:30.960 --> 01:48:34.020
when you're like in a car where it goes to the,
when you're red lining,

1821
01:48:34.080 --> 01:48:37.290
that needle's hitting the red Bro.
You can't,

1822
01:48:37.360 --> 01:48:39.090
you can't pull ahead when you're in the red,

1823
01:48:40.740 --> 01:48:42.600
can't pull ahead when you're in the red.
No that,

1824
01:48:42.630 --> 01:48:46.740
so if you're not in the shroom tech and you hit the red and don't be halfway

1825
01:48:46.741 --> 01:48:49.500
through your workout when you're,
the needle was hitting their ed,

1826
01:48:49.501 --> 01:48:51.120
your red line and already you can't go past,

1827
01:48:51.150 --> 01:48:55.860
you can't push through what the shroom tech does.
If you have that in you,

1828
01:48:57.150 --> 01:49:01.500
that needle won't go towards the right.
It'll go up there,
it'll go the green,

1829
01:49:01.560 --> 01:49:02.850
maybe even in the yellow,

1830
01:49:03.090 --> 01:49:07.200
and it'll hang in the yellow and you're pushing hard halfway,
three quarters,

1831
01:49:07.740 --> 01:49:10.950
last minute,
two minutes of the round.
You won't even be by the red.

1832
01:49:10.950 --> 01:49:15.660
You'll still be in the yellow.
That's what the shroom tech does.
Agree.

1833
01:49:16.200 --> 01:49:20.730
Agree.
Boom.
There you go.
We'll pick the shroom tech.
Shroom tech sport,
by the way.

1834
01:49:20.731 --> 01:49:25.500
Okay,
so now the slash.
Ajiaco what that signifies is you get 10% off.

1835
01:49:26.100 --> 01:49:30.450
Good deal.
I would say retail price is for suckers.

1836
01:49:30.451 --> 01:49:32.730
I would say that,
but it's not true.
I'm pretty real.

1837
01:49:32.850 --> 01:49:37.850
Retail if you want or just go to [inaudible] dot com and just get it,

1838
01:49:38.190 --> 01:49:42.660
don't get the 10% off 100% up to you.
Nonetheless,

1839
01:49:42.661 --> 01:49:44.460
you've got the shroom tech,
you've got the warrior bars.

1840
01:49:44.461 --> 01:49:47.860
It's like this dope thing as well.
Look into that.

1841
01:49:48.380 --> 01:49:52.060
Krill oil for your joints.
Get all that stuff.
In my opinion,
it helps.

1842
01:49:52.061 --> 01:49:57.061
That's why it's not like the Beta Gin power game 5,000 where it doesn't help.

1843
01:49:57.131 --> 01:50:01.030
This is the frill kind.
That helps.
I understood.
There you go.

1844
01:50:02.610 --> 01:50:05.750
We're good.
I'm telling him to leave y'all.
I'm telling everybody else.

1845
01:50:05.751 --> 01:50:07.250
You're over here like already know this.

1846
01:50:07.251 --> 01:50:10.230
I know you already no this but you know you got to put into perspective

1847
01:50:10.231 --> 01:50:15.231
sometimes you just certainly did on it.com/jocko this other things on there and

1848
01:50:18.420 --> 01:50:23.410
you can just kind of know.
You know when you,
when you,
when you get there,

1849
01:50:23.440 --> 01:50:27.220
you're going crazy for honor right now.
Here's the thing I like on it.

1850
01:50:27.221 --> 01:50:29.990
I'm going crazy.
You like it a lot more apparently tonight.
Yeah,

1851
01:50:30.410 --> 01:50:35.410
because I do feel like if I would've known this like what I'm saying now,

1852
01:50:36.350 --> 01:50:40.220
oh,
like before because I'm slowly getting new stuff.

1853
01:50:40.340 --> 01:50:43.220
Of course I got the word bar and I took Shreem tech before.
I know that,

1854
01:50:43.340 --> 01:50:45.470
but I'm like looking,
they got a new like recovery,

1855
01:50:45.670 --> 01:50:49.010
a pre workout and recovery drink.
It's all in one.
And I'm like,
Bro,

1856
01:50:49.070 --> 01:50:50.630
if I would've known all this,

1857
01:50:51.170 --> 01:50:53.750
I would've gotten him being in the game with this stuff a long time ago.

1858
01:50:53.870 --> 01:50:56.450
So you're,
you're providing a public,
so I'm sure you going to stand right now.

1859
01:50:56.451 --> 01:51:00.920
I'm letting it be known.
Right?
We're good.
Anyway,
I'm just going to sit over here.

1860
01:51:01.640 --> 01:51:03.940
I'll tell you another one that it got off the written law.
How,

1861
01:51:03.980 --> 01:51:07.400
I guess it's on the record,
but it's like a,
it's not peanut butter.

1862
01:51:07.401 --> 01:51:11.180
You know how they have almond butter,
but it's like an almond cashew.

1863
01:51:11.181 --> 01:51:13.070
It's like a mixed nut butter.

1864
01:51:13.990 --> 01:51:18.040
It's pretty dope from on it on it.
I might have to try that.
Yeah.

1865
01:51:18.880 --> 01:51:23.390
Um,
one of the major keys is that it's like legit quality.

1866
01:51:24.290 --> 01:51:25.160
Get 10% off.

1867
01:51:25.190 --> 01:51:28.940
If you go to [inaudible] dot com slash Jocko or just go to [inaudible] dot com

1868
01:51:28.941 --> 01:51:32.660
and get 0% off whatever you like.
You know another way to support

1869
01:51:35.390 --> 01:51:39.680
is the Amazon click through.
That's like what is,

1870
01:51:39.681 --> 01:51:43.760
if you don't know you go to or websites Jocko,

1871
01:51:43.761 --> 01:51:48.761
podcast.com over on the side to the right you'll see just some basic Amazon

1872
01:51:49.071 --> 01:51:51.170
banner.
You Click through there before you do shopping.

1873
01:51:51.590 --> 01:51:55.940
You're Christmas shopping or your everyday shopping and I'm,

1874
01:51:55.941 --> 01:51:57.380
that kind of supports the podcast.

1875
01:51:57.381 --> 01:52:00.710
It makes Amazon or Amazon gives us like a little kickback.

1876
01:52:02.180 --> 01:52:03.110
That's a good way to support.

1877
01:52:04.700 --> 01:52:08.930
I made the comparison to little piece of sodium.

1878
01:52:09.020 --> 01:52:11.930
It's like seems like this teeny tiny thing cause just clicking through Amazon

1879
01:52:11.931 --> 01:52:15.260
and shopping,
whether that's a teeny tiny three second effort,

1880
01:52:16.430 --> 01:52:19.100
but it does a big deal,
you know,
as far as supporting.

1881
01:52:20.870 --> 01:52:25.640
So it means we don't have to run advertisements on the podcasts.
Yeah,

1882
01:52:25.700 --> 01:52:27.830
which I hate,
which I don't believe I'm going to do it.

1883
01:52:27.890 --> 01:52:32.470
Not going to do aside from Onnit would technically that's,
well,
you know,

1884
01:52:32.540 --> 01:52:36.110
but I was taking on it before this.
I'm telling you anyway,

1885
01:52:36.140 --> 01:52:40.800
but you know what?
Hold on a second while we go to a commercial break.
Yeah,

1886
01:52:40.980 --> 01:52:45.080
no,
don't want to do that.
Yeah.
This isn't even a commercial break.
This is the

1887
01:52:46.270 --> 01:52:49.040
<v 0>part of,
this is the deal.
We're doing it together.</v>

1888
01:52:49.041 --> 01:52:50.630
I'm going to remember to do this.

1889
01:52:50.631 --> 01:52:55.631
I'm going to do like fake commercials during the next podcast or like in a

1890
01:52:56.061 --> 01:52:56.451
podcast.

1891
01:52:56.451 --> 01:53:00.240
In the future I'm gonna do fake commercials and make everyone just suffer

1892
01:53:00.241 --> 01:53:03.530
through fake commercials just to see how much it,
it's horrible.

1893
01:53:04.250 --> 01:53:08.650
And then say if you never want to hear that again,
click through Amazon.
Amazon.

1894
01:53:11.170 --> 01:53:14.530
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's a,
that's a good way though.
Speaking of fake commercials.

1895
01:53:14.531 --> 01:53:17.210
So I did these two fake commercials,
made them videos.

1896
01:53:17.390 --> 01:53:21.230
I've seen him Bardis beer and then there's part is prime,

1897
01:53:21.231 --> 01:53:25.400
which is like 40 ounce.
It's a lot of racial stereotypes.
No,

1898
01:53:25.460 --> 01:53:29.900
but nonetheless.
Oh,
back to the Amazon.
Click through thing.

1899
01:53:29.901 --> 01:53:34.880
That's a good way to support.
So be the,
be the sodium.
If you,

1900
01:53:35.040 --> 01:53:39.640
if you understand,
um,
and of course subscribe to the podcast on iTunes.
That's a,

1901
01:53:39.700 --> 01:53:43.940
that's a big deal.
Um,
and leave a review man.
If you're in the mood,

1902
01:53:45.320 --> 01:53:46.340
do you read the reviews?

1903
01:53:46.910 --> 01:53:51.910
I do read the reviews and what I noticed was I was looking at some other reviews

1904
01:53:52.070 --> 01:53:53.180
today cause I was reading,

1905
01:53:53.181 --> 01:53:58.010
I read our reviews today to see if there's any good input.
There was good stuff.

1906
01:53:58.400 --> 01:53:59.710
I looked at other what,

1907
01:53:59.711 --> 01:54:04.711
what this kind of got me motivated to see is that the people that write our

1908
01:54:05.241 --> 01:54:06.560
reviews,
they're getting in the game.

1909
01:54:06.800 --> 01:54:11.800
They're writing full paragraphs with detailed likes and pros and cons and all

1910
01:54:11.871 --> 01:54:16.790
that.
You go to some other peoples that have feedback on nurse that has just two

1911
01:54:16.791 --> 01:54:20.690
words,
good podcasts or I love it.
I love it.

1912
01:54:20.691 --> 01:54:25.220
Five stars that's I love at FiveStars is a lot different than someone saying.

1913
01:54:25.370 --> 01:54:29.570
What I really like about the Jocko podcast is that they go into detail on these

1914
01:54:29.571 --> 01:54:32.360
leadership elements that have helped me in the following ways,
but,

1915
01:54:32.361 --> 01:54:37.040
and you go through the whole thing.
Yeah.
That's really good.
Support.
The podcast.

1916
01:54:37.100 --> 01:54:39.740
I'll tell you this about that because really when you think about it,

1917
01:54:39.741 --> 01:54:42.650
if you're just like,
and some of them were funny by the way,

1918
01:54:43.760 --> 01:54:47.150
and the ones for,
for Jocko t that aren't Amazon,

1919
01:54:48.200 --> 01:54:51.080
I'm going to have to figure out a way to publish those or do something with
them.

1920
01:54:51.081 --> 01:54:54.440
Cause some of them are are awesome.
Eric's,
Eric's was insane,

1921
01:54:54.770 --> 01:54:57.980
but there's been a few of them.
Yeah,
those are good.

1922
01:54:58.910 --> 01:55:01.070
I retweeted a bunch of them.
Yeah.

1923
01:55:01.130 --> 01:55:04.060
So everybody thinks it's a little hard to retweet them.
So I had to,

1924
01:55:04.160 --> 01:55:05.930
I have to figure out a way to retweet them better,

1925
01:55:06.020 --> 01:55:09.470
the capture screenshot or something.
But they're so good.
They're so funny.

1926
01:55:10.250 --> 01:55:14.450
Some of them are pretty wordsmith s oh,
some of them are long.
Some of them,

1927
01:55:14.451 --> 01:55:18.680
it takes me six minutes to read it and I want to actually highlight stuff and

1928
01:55:18.681 --> 01:55:23.440
take notes and do the deal.
But yeah,
that's it.

1929
01:55:23.441 --> 01:55:27.760
That's a good in there.
Well,
when you think about it,
even if the,

1930
01:55:27.761 --> 01:55:31.640
if someone's in the mood to write a review and they're just like deck gift,

1931
01:55:31.760 --> 01:55:35.060
great podcast,
five stars.
I see.
Do that.
That's true too.

1932
01:55:35.180 --> 01:55:37.700
It doesn't have to be long.
You what that is when people are like,

1933
01:55:37.701 --> 01:55:41.660
this is what I like about it or whatever.
That's just all it is.

1934
01:55:41.661 --> 01:55:44.310
Is the result of someone being

1935
01:55:44.310 --> 01:55:47.850
<v 3>in the mood to write a review in genuinely writing it</v>

1936
01:55:49.670 --> 01:55:51.480
fricking awesome.
Beyond writing it.

1937
01:55:51.660 --> 01:55:54.770
I'd say that qualifies is getting after getting after it.
Yeah.
So you know,

1938
01:55:54.790 --> 01:55:59.790
you see unmitigated discipline and all things or is it getting after it in all

1939
01:56:00.060 --> 01:56:03.770
the big day daily.
You're missing the word daily.
Daily,
Yeah.
Yeah.
Anyway,
yeah.

1940
01:56:03.930 --> 01:56:07.200
Just medicating daily discipline and all things.
Yup.

1941
01:56:07.650 --> 01:56:10.020
And getting after it and I'll think,
I know that's new,

1942
01:56:10.021 --> 01:56:14.730
but still we're going with it.
So please write a review.
Subscribe to Youtube.

1943
01:56:16.060 --> 01:56:20.340
We're doing some more videos on top of the podcast videos,

1944
01:56:20.820 --> 01:56:22.830
excerpts,
some excerpt.

1945
01:56:22.831 --> 01:56:27.750
Tell Echo on Twitter what excerpts you want so he doesn't have to figure out

1946
01:56:27.751 --> 01:56:29.190
what you want.
Just tell him what you want.

1947
01:56:29.310 --> 01:56:33.420
Give them the the podcast and the times time hack.
He'll pull it out.

1948
01:56:33.450 --> 01:56:36.240
I'll put it on there.
Yeah,
I will.
Yeah,
that's,
that's,

1949
01:56:36.241 --> 01:56:40.370
I think that the challenge I think is going back and finding them,
but that,

1950
01:56:40.410 --> 01:56:43.030
you know what,
that's not a challenge is not shot.
Well it is,

1951
01:56:43.230 --> 01:56:44.880
but it is a little bit,
cause you might not,

1952
01:56:44.910 --> 01:56:48.190
if something might not have struck you the way it struck someone else.
Yeah,

1953
01:56:48.270 --> 01:56:51.240
that's true.
That's true.
And so if it's striking one person out there,

1954
01:56:51.241 --> 01:56:55.170
it's probably striking at least four or five more people that want to hear that

1955
01:56:55.171 --> 01:56:59.790
excerpt.
So let's give it to them.
So tell echo podcast number,

1956
01:56:59.970 --> 01:57:03.150
timestamp.
That would be easy for you,
right?
Yes.

1957
01:57:03.350 --> 01:57:07.200
Cause we don't want to stress you out.
Don't stress delicate.

1958
01:57:07.950 --> 01:57:09.510
We know that we're were sensitive to that.

1959
01:57:09.610 --> 01:57:14.490
We don't want to be disappointed in you except if you're Brady,

1960
01:57:14.760 --> 01:57:18.780
Lisa,
Debby,
Andy,
anyone that we don't be like,

1961
01:57:18.781 --> 01:57:23.060
hey I liked this timestamp because like we said your name on the podcast make x

1962
01:57:23.061 --> 01:57:26.660
or don't say that.
So those people kind of can't do that.
Why not?
All right.

1963
01:57:26.690 --> 01:57:28.800
Well I guess we're saying they shouldn't be there listening.

1964
01:57:29.670 --> 01:57:33.480
They probably have good input and he's on,
it's going to be like 20 seconds song.

1965
01:57:33.481 --> 01:57:36.150
Hey,
that part where you meant good and 20 seconds is fine.

1966
01:57:36.480 --> 01:57:37.640
It's what you need to understand that though.

1967
01:57:37.710 --> 01:57:39.390
People want to watch stuff that's 20 seconds long.

1968
01:57:40.350 --> 01:57:43.830
They don't want to watch 29 minutes.
That's why it's called an excerpt.

1969
01:57:44.190 --> 01:57:48.430
Jukka we got a store.
We do have a store.
It's called chocolate store.
Well yeah,

1970
01:57:48.470 --> 01:57:53.100
I know we already knew this,
but no real new developments there really.

1971
01:57:53.280 --> 01:57:57.810
But if you didn't know that is a good way to support and you get some stuff in

1972
01:57:57.811 --> 01:58:00.030
return.
It's a bone by shirt.
If you're down,

1973
01:58:00.480 --> 01:58:05.100
if you like them is wanting to Jacola's face on.
It says good backwards,

1974
01:58:05.340 --> 01:58:10.080
backwards.
So if you look in the mirror it's,
it's for you.
That message is for you

1975
01:58:12.520 --> 01:58:17.460
layers anyway.
Yeah,
it could look at,
there's rash guards,

1976
01:58:17.461 --> 01:58:19.290
their rash guards are good for,
you know,

1977
01:58:19.291 --> 01:58:22.060
the Jujitsu for any physical activity where you need range of motion.

1978
01:58:22.070 --> 01:58:25.050
Retrigger it's good.
They look good too according to people.

1979
01:58:27.150 --> 01:58:29.640
Here's a tip for the rash guards and I think for the shirts as well,

1980
01:58:29.641 --> 01:58:32.640
if you're one of those inbetweeners like that means your site like,
Hey,

1981
01:58:32.641 --> 01:58:35.370
I you were a large,
but if it fits slim,

1982
01:58:35.760 --> 01:58:37.740
I need an extra large like that kind of people.

1983
01:58:39.480 --> 01:58:42.090
It fits like this much slimmer.
Know that swift,

1984
01:58:42.090 --> 01:58:43.570
<v 2>the rash guard betweener everything.</v>

1985
01:58:43.571 --> 01:58:47.560
Rash guard and the shirts go big goal to the bigger size if you're an in between

1986
01:58:47.561 --> 01:58:50.970
or God.
Yeah,
for sure.
That's just the tip.
Good advice because the,

1987
01:58:50.980 --> 01:58:52.210
and that's good news for you though.

1988
01:58:52.260 --> 01:58:56.450
<v 0>You know what,
out of the past 39 minutes you've been talking about this,</v>

1989
01:58:56.451 --> 01:58:57.590
the way to support the podcast,

1990
01:58:57.650 --> 01:58:59.360
that was the most important thing that you've said.

1991
01:59:00.770 --> 01:59:04.610
That was the valuable piece of information.
Arguably.
Yeah.

1992
01:59:05.510 --> 01:59:09.290
<v 2>I respect your opinion on the matter.
This is the women's stuff too.</v>

1993
01:59:09.350 --> 01:59:10.670
Don't neglect the leaves.

1994
01:59:14.060 --> 01:59:18.920
This is in my opinion,
something that I overlooked.

1995
01:59:20.000 --> 01:59:22.310
If you want to support the Bobcat,
you know,
you know how it's like,

1996
01:59:22.311 --> 01:59:25.310
oh well my girl's birthday is coming up.
In this case,
Christmas coming up.

1997
01:59:25.880 --> 01:59:28.190
I only bought my wife one thing and it was,

1998
01:59:28.220 --> 01:59:30.440
it wasn't directed cause they don't have that creative thing.

1999
01:59:30.441 --> 01:59:35.330
If you're thinking that get them a discipline equals freedom,
women's tee shirt,

2000
01:59:35.331 --> 01:59:40.331
v-neck pink or black or whatever the color you like.

2001
01:59:41.510 --> 01:59:45.820
But there is pink.
If you won't be getting one of that against my,
that's it.

2002
01:59:45.840 --> 01:59:47.930
That'll have a two pronged effect.
Boom.

2003
01:59:47.931 --> 01:59:52.931
You get her a solid shirt that you didn't get at the swap meet their quality

2004
01:59:52.941 --> 01:59:54.680
stuff there.
They're good shirts.
You know,

2005
01:59:54.681 --> 01:59:55.970
we made it a point to get the good ones.

2006
01:59:56.250 --> 02:00:00.440
You've got a good quality shirt and she became instantly in the game.

2007
02:00:00.920 --> 02:00:04.370
Two pronged effect.
We'll get that for your wife if you want.

2008
02:00:04.371 --> 02:00:06.590
That's a suggestion and three pronged effects.
The part,

2009
02:00:06.591 --> 02:00:07.790
the podcast boom there it is.

2010
02:00:08.120 --> 02:00:13.010
Some hoodies in there as well for the cold weather and uh,
yeah,
some patches.

2011
02:00:13.011 --> 02:00:17.510
The official like two by three,
10 f d flat,

2012
02:00:17.511 --> 02:00:21.050
dark earth color official where with your uniform boom.

2013
02:00:22.010 --> 02:00:23.750
Available now as they say

2014
02:00:24.130 --> 02:00:27.240
<v 0>Jacqueline,
startup.com.
Um,</v>

2015
02:00:27.430 --> 02:00:30.730
also we've got Jocko white tea.

2016
02:00:30.790 --> 02:00:35.790
Now Jocko white tea is in apparently extremely high demand.

2017
02:00:36.040 --> 02:00:36.460
Why?

2018
02:00:36.460 --> 02:00:41.410
Because it tastes awesome and it also makes you feel good and it's got

2019
02:00:41.411 --> 02:00:44.860
antioxidants,
it which makes you healthier.
Yes.

2020
02:00:45.730 --> 02:00:47.860
And I'm not going to use any scientific terms,

2021
02:00:47.890 --> 02:00:51.640
I'm just going to tell you it's doing.
So it's been,
it's been in high demand.

2022
02:00:51.670 --> 02:00:54.970
We have logistical issues right straight up.

2023
02:00:55.090 --> 02:00:58.180
So it's showing up at Amazon.
It's getting going through their system,

2024
02:00:58.750 --> 02:01:02.350
just keep checking.
And we've got,
I told,

2025
02:01:02.380 --> 02:01:06.160
I told everyone that we would never run out of white.
You again.

2026
02:01:07.690 --> 02:01:09.760
This was a mistake promptly.

2027
02:01:09.850 --> 02:01:14.850
I did not understand the logistic challenges that we would be facing now.

2028
02:01:15.850 --> 02:01:19.840
I have not even doubled down,
not even tripled down.

2029
02:01:20.560 --> 02:01:25.560
I have quadrupled down to make the future bright.

2030
02:01:26.590 --> 02:01:31.590
We will get to a point in the future where we will literally never run out of

2031
02:01:32.711 --> 02:01:37.540
Jocko white tea.
But for now we,
but for now,

2032
02:01:37.970 --> 02:01:41.930
um,
keep checking back on Amazon.
Sign up for the little notification thing.

2033
02:01:41.960 --> 02:01:45.050
Cause when we,
when they clear it through their little system,

2034
02:01:45.320 --> 02:01:48.830
it shows up and everyone that has the notification is buying it immediately.

2035
02:01:48.831 --> 02:01:52.550
So it's running out.
The other day it was up for 18 minutes or something.

2036
02:01:52.551 --> 02:01:57.200
It was gone.
Wait,
what notification?
The Amazon,
the Amazon you can sign up for,

2037
02:01:57.201 --> 02:02:01.970
notify me when this is back in stock.
So when that happens,

2038
02:02:02.000 --> 02:02:05.150
boom,
you can order it immediately.
The mugs,

2039
02:02:05.210 --> 02:02:08.750
the mugs that say get after it on them and that have a little uh,

2040
02:02:08.751 --> 02:02:12.800
approved symbol with someone's head that looks a lot like me on it.

2041
02:02:13.640 --> 02:02:16.700
You can get those on Amazon as well and they're big.

2042
02:02:16.730 --> 02:02:21.730
They're bigger than normal because you figure that way you can fit more white

2043
02:02:22.611 --> 02:02:27.611
tea in it and be more better and you can get those.

2044
02:02:28.070 --> 02:02:32.900
Those are also same thing on Amazon.
Again,
I apologize,

2045
02:02:33.200 --> 02:02:37.460
but the way the system works,
they're coming in,
they show up and then they,

2046
02:02:37.790 --> 02:02:40.790
and then they take a certain amount of input them into the system,

2047
02:02:41.030 --> 02:02:43.580
but then they don't realize yet at Amazon,
Amazon doesn't,

2048
02:02:43.700 --> 02:02:46.550
they're not in the game yet to be quite honest with you.
They're not in the game.

2049
02:02:46.551 --> 02:02:49.610
They don't understand what's happening.
We're trying to explain it to them,

2050
02:02:49.670 --> 02:02:53.510
that people want mugs.
They want,
when they want mugs,

2051
02:02:53.540 --> 02:02:57.560
they also want ti to put into the monks were getting there.
Same thing.

2052
02:02:57.650 --> 02:02:59.370
Logistically,
we'll get to a point where we were,

2053
02:02:59.371 --> 02:03:01.970
where we will not run out amongst.

2054
02:03:01.971 --> 02:03:05.120
Now I don't know what the mugs will keep making forever.
I don't know.

2055
02:03:05.121 --> 02:03:08.240
Because once everyone has one,
then they'll say,
okay,
I got mine.

2056
02:03:08.241 --> 02:03:12.590
So then we'll stop making them.
But you can get them on Amazon.

2057
02:03:12.650 --> 02:03:16.100
You can get the t on Amazon,
you can get the reload,
which is a hundred bags.

2058
02:03:16.101 --> 02:03:17.480
You can get the 10,

2059
02:03:17.780 --> 02:03:22.760
which is quality container that you can then reload with the reload.

2060
02:03:23.300 --> 02:03:26.980
So do that.
That's on amazon.com.
Uh,

2061
02:03:27.320 --> 02:03:32.320
also extreme ownership muster number two in where?

2062
02:03:33.650 --> 02:03:36.650
New York City,
it's going to be May 4th and May 5th,

2063
02:03:38.060 --> 02:03:42.710
www.extremeownership.com go get registered,

2064
02:03:42.740 --> 02:03:47.030
do it fast.
The price does go up.
The closer we get to the date.

2065
02:03:47.980 --> 02:03:52.430
So a,
I don't want you to pay more.
B,
it's going to sell out.

2066
02:03:53.000 --> 02:03:54.230
So the faster you do it,

2067
02:03:54.290 --> 02:03:57.830
the better chance you have of going and of paying a lower price.

2068
02:04:00.230 --> 02:04:01.100
When we get there,

2069
02:04:02.120 --> 02:04:07.120
if you're thinking that I'm not going to sit there and talk to you and I'm not

2070
02:04:07.581 --> 02:04:09.620
going to sign your book and lace not going to sit there and talk to you and

2071
02:04:09.621 --> 02:04:12.380
life's not going to sign your book,
you're wrong.
We're going to sit there.

2072
02:04:12.620 --> 02:04:14.690
We're going to sign your book,
we're going to talk to you,

2073
02:04:14.691 --> 02:04:17.000
we're going to address your problems.
We're going to hang out.

2074
02:04:17.570 --> 02:04:22.040
We didn't go behind the curtain at all.

2075
02:04:23.150 --> 02:04:26.300
Zero Times.
Actually we did one when the thing was over,

2076
02:04:26.330 --> 02:04:28.280
we walked back off stage off off the,

2077
02:04:28.490 --> 02:04:32.210
off the stage and behind the curtain for about three minutes cause we were a

2078
02:04:32.211 --> 02:04:36.290
little bit fired up at that point and we just walked back there and
decompressed.

2079
02:04:36.710 --> 02:04:38.940
They came out and started signing books.
That was one time,

2080
02:04:38.941 --> 02:04:42.330
but the rest of the time,
oh,
we'd say,
okay everyone take a 10 minute break.

2081
02:04:42.570 --> 02:04:45.750
We'd go to the front and sign books,
right.
Boom.

2082
02:04:45.751 --> 02:04:48.480
Or talk to people or addressed something or whatever.

2083
02:04:48.481 --> 02:04:52.590
So this isn't a thing where you go and we're going to be,
uh,
you know,

2084
02:04:52.591 --> 02:04:56.260
behind the curtain and come out.
Like I'm a Rockstar and I'm not a rock star.

2085
02:04:56.990 --> 02:05:00.460
I'm not,
I'm not nothing.
And the,

2086
02:05:00.510 --> 02:05:02.760
my purpose of being here is to hang out.

2087
02:05:03.060 --> 02:05:06.030
So that's why we're going to the monster.
That's where we're having the muster.

2088
02:05:06.510 --> 02:05:09.240
So come to the muster New York City,
come and hang out.

2089
02:05:10.080 --> 02:05:12.450
You're going to learn something.
I'm going to learn something.
Oh yeah,

2090
02:05:12.480 --> 02:05:16.430
we're all gonna learn something and you're going to meet a bunch of people that

2091
02:05:16.431 --> 02:05:20.990
are,
I hate using this term.
Bunch of people that are likeminded,
right?

2092
02:05:21.020 --> 02:05:24.890
Cause really can do minds be like,
no,
they can't be.
But can two people,

2093
02:05:24.920 --> 02:05:27.620
three people,
300,
450 people,

2094
02:05:27.621 --> 02:05:30.590
they're going to be New York City that I want to get after it.
Can they be there?

2095
02:05:30.620 --> 02:05:33.140
Yes they can.
And they will be in force

2096
02:05:35.160 --> 02:05:39.540
until we get to the monster.
In the meantime,
if you want to talk to us,

2097
02:05:41.010 --> 02:05:46.010
it just so happens that we're all up in the Inter webs on Twitter,

2098
02:05:48.570 --> 02:05:52.100
on Instagram.
And as you might've seen.

2099
02:05:52.120 --> 02:05:54.450
So we also on that phase,
bookie,

2100
02:05:54.480 --> 02:05:57.420

thank you for listening.

2103
02:06:09.600 --> 02:06:13.170
Thank you for listening for the past year,

2104
02:06:14.460 --> 02:06:18.300
52 straight weeks,
no breaks.

2105
02:06:19.290 --> 02:06:20.370
But I want to say this,

2106
02:06:20.371 --> 02:06:24.990
I want to tell you something else and I want to make this clear.

2107
02:06:27.350 --> 02:06:32.210
Don't just listen.
Don't just listen.

2108
02:06:32.420 --> 02:06:36.280
Do,
um,

2109
02:06:36.820 --> 02:06:41.050
I'm not just talking so you know,
I'm not just talking,

2110
02:06:41.860 --> 02:06:42.940
I'm doing,

2111
02:06:44.830 --> 02:06:49.830
and I don't want you to just listen to put this information to work.

2112
02:06:53.420 --> 02:06:58.250
Make today count every day.

2113
02:06:59.590 --> 02:07:00.423
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

2114
02:07:00.490 --> 02:07:04.300
<v 0>go forward.
Get aggressive and attack.</v>

2115
02:07:04.360 --> 02:07:08.950
Whether it's on the battlefield or on the beat,

2116
02:07:10.540 --> 02:07:13.760
or in the factory Taree or on the farm,

2117
02:07:14.060 --> 02:07:17.780
or on the construction site,
or on the website,

2118
02:07:19.470 --> 02:07:24.150
in the garage or in the firehouse.
Don't hesitate,

2119
02:07:26.370 --> 02:07:31.080
step,
step forward.

2120
02:07:33.950 --> 02:07:34.783
Get after it.

2121
02:07:37.050 --> 02:07:39.030
So until next time,

2122
02:07:40.530 --> 02:07:44.040
this is echo and Jocko out.
