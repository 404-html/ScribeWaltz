00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:13.920
[inaudible].

2
00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:33.940
Good.
Good.

3
00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:42.670
<v 1>This is Jocko podcast number one 60 with Echo Charles and me,</v>

4
00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:44.413
Jocko Willink.

5
00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:48.570
<v 0>Good evening.
Good evening.</v>

6
00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:57.573
<v 1>October.</v>

7
00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:02.830
I'm going to head your way

8
00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:05.150
<v 0>then.
See you today</v>

9
00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:08.800
<v 1>though.</v>

10
00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:12.910
Sometimes I wonder why should

11
00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:18.250
sometimes you don't seem to care

12
00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.170
and that makes me mad brother.

13
00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:25.713
<v 0>Okay,</v>

14
00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:30.730
<v 1>and then when I see you,
it doesn't really make me feel any better</v>

15
00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:39.200
should it?
Is that what this is for?

16
00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:44.590
It doesn't seem to be.

17
00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:51.510
It actually just makes me remember the way things used to be

18
00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:55.900
better times.

19
00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.210
It makes me wonder why things turned out this way.

20
00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:07.060
What did I do wrong?

21
00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:12.920
Should I have done something different?

22
00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:17.220
What could I have said?

23
00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:25.310
You never let me down ever.

24
00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:26.473
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

25
00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.110
<v 1>but now you won't even talk to me.</v>

26
00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:38.740
I was looking at some of the things you wrote to me in the past.

27
00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:42.480
I opened up in the email.

28
00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:45.293
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

29
00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:50.480
<v 1>in it you wrote,
I feel it again,
washing over me.</v>

30
00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:56.160
The descent into degeneration and disintegration,

31
00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.740
the smell of filth,
black water,

32
00:02:58.741 --> 00:03:01.480
mixed blood and gunpowder and shit.

33
00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:09.790
The American soldier covered in filth 11 months into a 16 month deployment.

34
00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:15.950
The insurgence,

35
00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:20.030
grown men hiding behind children,

36
00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:24.400
women wailing over the dead,

37
00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:29.490
explosions and screams and fragments of concrete flying through the air

38
00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:38.940
and frog men entered the scene to take the hand of the American soldier and pull

39
00:03:39.371 --> 00:03:40.840
him from the whirlpool

40
00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:46.200
to set his feet back on the rock and speak words of hope.

41
00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:49.500
<v 0>Okay.</v>

42
00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:51.810
<v 1>We are the prophets of doom and destruction.</v>

43
00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:56.370
We enter an area and take back the lost pride of America.

44
00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:03.810
We read in the stripes blue the field and make the stars of our tattered and

45
00:04:04.211 --> 00:04:07.900
humiliated battle.
Enson shine.
Once again,

46
00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:12.110
we hold it high.

47
00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:13.860
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

48
00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:18.720
<v 1>we carry a nation on our shoulders and we bring the enemy to its knees.</v>

49
00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:21.603
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

50
00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:27.040
<v 1>We do not live in fear of death or wounding or even worse rejection by the</v>

51
00:04:27.321 --> 00:04:28.460
country we love.

52
00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:32.183
<v 0>Okay.</v>

53
00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:37.550
<v 1>I feel my mind coming apart and the old sleeping animal coming out.</v>

54
00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:42.010
I tried to keep it inside,

55
00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:47.980
but it cannot help but attend the call to battle.

56
00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:59.650
When you originally wrote that to me,

57
00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:01.660
I thought to myself,

58
00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:06.660
<v 0>Yup,
he's there again,</v>

59
00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:10.710
<v 1>where he should be.</v>

60
00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:15.490
I knew it wouldn't last forever,

61
00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:20.530
but where are you now?

62
00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:28.920
Now you seem distant
in my head.

63
00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:31.860
I can see you smile.
I can hear you laugh.

64
00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:33.380
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

65
00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:34.760
<v 1>but it's only in my head.</v>

66
00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:42.770
I was surfing the other day.
It was one of those days.

67
00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:44.673
<v 0>Good day,</v>

68
00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:48.760
<v 1>solid swell.
No wind.</v>

69
00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:51.940
Tide was low in the sky was clear and bright.

70
00:05:56.910 --> 00:06:00.600
I kept looking out toward the outside

71
00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:05.490
where you used to sit and wait for the big set waves.

72
00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:11.000
I thought I saw you a couple of times,

73
00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:14.443
<v 0>but it wasn't you.</v>

74
00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:19.900
<v 1>I heard someone paddling behind me.</v>

75
00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:26.190
<v 0>Must be you.
I thought,
no,</v>

76
00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:31.770
nothing.
No one's there.

77
00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:35.730
<v 1>I'm all alone.
Out here.</v>

78
00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:43.670
Everything is the same,
but nothing is the same.

79
00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:49.040
Everything has changed,
but nothing has changed.

80
00:06:52.810 --> 00:06:54.550
Does anything ever change?

81
00:06:57.990 --> 00:07:01.680
Look at the waves.
As they approached the shore,

82
00:07:04.110 --> 00:07:09.110
each wave formed through random combinations of wind and sea and pressure and

83
00:07:10.921 --> 00:07:13.320
each one completely unique.

84
00:07:17.090 --> 00:07:20.840
And when they break,
they're gone forever.

85
00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:29.840
But then another one comes behind it
and another one,

86
00:07:33.010 --> 00:07:34.070
they are all different,

87
00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:38.330
but they're all the same.

88
00:07:41.410 --> 00:07:44.910
And I see some of the past and the future and I see some of the future and the

89
00:07:44.911 --> 00:07:49.390
past and I begin to wonder which is which.

90
00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:53.920
How did I get here?

91
00:07:57.540 --> 00:07:58.920
<v 0>Where am I going to end up?</v>

92
00:08:03.180 --> 00:08:04.050
<v 1>Where are you?</v>

93
00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:09.790
I look at some more of your writing.

94
00:08:11.290 --> 00:08:16.240
You are telling a story,
writing a story about a man,

95
00:08:17.820 --> 00:08:21.210
<v 0>about God,
about life,</v>

96
00:08:22.860 --> 00:08:23.760
about death,

97
00:08:26.790 --> 00:08:27.990
<v 1>and this is what you wrote.</v>

98
00:08:29.380 --> 00:08:30.213
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

99
00:08:30.870 --> 00:08:34.170
<v 1>I am ready to go.
He thought to himself,</v>

100
00:08:36.420 --> 00:08:39.540
but for you,
I wait for the appointed time.

101
00:08:41.820 --> 00:08:42.960
THY will.

102
00:08:43.170 --> 00:08:48.170
He said to himself and closed his eyes and placed his hands on the pages as if

103
00:08:49.051 --> 00:08:52.200
there was some strength there and he prayed

104
00:08:56.140 --> 00:09:00.370
while he prayed.
He also thought of past times

105
00:09:02.740 --> 00:09:05.080
he breathed in deep and exhaled

106
00:09:08.610 --> 00:09:11.190
deliver us from the evil one.
He muttered

107
00:09:13.590 --> 00:09:17.310
and he thought of all the reasons he had no right to say this prayer

108
00:09:20.900 --> 00:09:23.850
at that he steadied himself,

109
00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:28.500
opened his eyes and looked out into the first light of the morning.

110
00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:35.200
He saw a face,
not his own,
looking back at him from the window and disappeared,

111
00:09:37.380 --> 00:09:38.580
but he was not startled.

112
00:09:40.790 --> 00:09:42.620
This kind of thing was normal.

113
00:09:45.450 --> 00:09:48.310
I'm ready for you.
He thought to himself

114
00:09:51.020 --> 00:09:54.050
while he ran that morning.
He did not think about anything.

115
00:09:55.800 --> 00:10:00.800
His mind retreated deep into itself or perhaps it shut down altogether and he

116
00:10:00.871 --> 00:10:02.040
wore no expression.

117
00:10:04.090 --> 00:10:08.890
He only looked out at the sea and watched as the sea birds glided above the

118
00:10:08.891 --> 00:10:12.520
undulating plane of water moving close above its surface,

119
00:10:12.700 --> 00:10:15.790
but managing somehow not to touch it

120
00:10:18.570 --> 00:10:22.860
at home.
He heaved weights around on a small concrete slab.

121
00:10:24.450 --> 00:10:29.450
There's routine effortlessly recited and at the same time painfully undertaken

122
00:10:30.030 --> 00:10:34.020
again without fought or care

123
00:10:36.590 --> 00:10:37.910
every morning the same

124
00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:42.830
marking off time until an appointed end,

125
00:10:44.780 --> 00:10:46.100
his final rendezvous.

126
00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:53.960
That's what you wrote.

127
00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:00.170
Is that what we're doing here?

128
00:11:01.460 --> 00:11:04.550
Marking off time until an appointed end.

129
00:11:08.820 --> 00:11:11.910
My memory plays tricks on me.

130
00:11:15.330 --> 00:11:17.970
How many days do I remember?

131
00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:23.600
How many days do I actually remember

132
00:11:27.530 --> 00:11:30.830
and what good is a day that I can't remember?

133
00:11:33.890 --> 00:11:38.070
Did it happen?
Did it exist?

134
00:11:41.370 --> 00:11:44.520
I want to remember every day,
but I can't.

135
00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:53.680
I let some of them go
and hate that.

136
00:11:55.450 --> 00:11:56.283
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

137
00:11:56.510 --> 00:12:01.130
<v 1>I want to remember and we remember the times we had together.</v>

138
00:12:09.480 --> 00:12:11.400
We played songs on the guitar,

139
00:12:15.100 --> 00:12:16.810
but I can't hear them anymore.

140
00:12:20.840 --> 00:12:25.790
They are gone.
I can't

141
00:12:27.500 --> 00:12:28.640
recreate them.

142
00:12:32.470 --> 00:12:33.550
I'm not good enough.

143
00:12:37.940 --> 00:12:40.490
Can we play him again?

144
00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:44.630
One more song.

145
00:12:51.620 --> 00:12:53.120
Here is some more of your writing.

146
00:12:56.910 --> 00:12:58.410
I am God's Messenger.

147
00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:03.190
I am a chieftain of Michael,
the angel.

148
00:13:05.900 --> 00:13:10.900
He has granted my request to help you for it is you who are doing the bidding of

149
00:13:11.061 --> 00:13:15.880
the king.
We have heard your many prayers.

150
00:13:16.930 --> 00:13:19.810
They burned before us day and night.
Yes,

151
00:13:19.900 --> 00:13:22.930
heaven is full of the fragrance of your prayers

152
00:13:24.970 --> 00:13:28.960
and I bring glad tidings from the lord of Lords.

153
00:13:31.890 --> 00:13:34.170
He is preparing his mouth to ride here,

154
00:13:36.940 --> 00:13:40.600
but there is still more to be done on earth before he wields his Skype than

155
00:13:40.601 --> 00:13:41.560
sword upon it.

156
00:13:45.580 --> 00:13:46.930
I bring a message.

157
00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:53.480
The Lord of Lords wants to help you reap the spirits against whom you are

158
00:13:55.231 --> 00:13:59.840
warring.
Indeed,

159
00:13:59.960 --> 00:14:02.000
Satan has asked to have you,

160
00:14:03.990 --> 00:14:05.640
but we will not let that happen.

161
00:14:09.170 --> 00:14:12.590
Of course,
you always have a choice.

162
00:14:14.420 --> 00:14:16.070
I have come a long way though.

163
00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:20.620
I came when we heard your last prayer.

164
00:14:23.870 --> 00:14:25.730
You will not be turned.

165
00:14:35.100 --> 00:14:36.150
When I read that,

166
00:14:38.910 --> 00:14:40.440
it seems obvious

167
00:14:43.080 --> 00:14:44.730
even God was on your side,

168
00:14:49.010 --> 00:14:52.070
but if God was on your side,
how did you up like this then?

169
00:14:55.640 --> 00:14:57.440
How could you do this to me?

170
00:14:59.060 --> 00:14:59.893
<v 0>Okay,</v>

171
00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:01.550
<v 1>what about me?</v>

172
00:15:02.500 --> 00:15:03.333
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

173
00:15:03.380 --> 00:15:06.890
<v 1>Yeah.
I know I'm being selfish,</v>

174
00:15:06.950 --> 00:15:08.420
but what about me?

175
00:15:14.510 --> 00:15:17.480
You know what?
I'm not going to see you today.
You can wait

176
00:15:21.080 --> 00:15:25.970
after everything I did for you after everything we went through together.

177
00:15:29.810 --> 00:15:30.830
You can wait

178
00:15:37.220 --> 00:15:38.053
<v 0>December.</v>

179
00:15:43.100 --> 00:15:47.960
<v 1>Okay.
I calm down a little bit.</v>

180
00:15:51.010 --> 00:15:56.010
I pride myself in keeping control of my emotions,

181
00:15:58.060 --> 00:16:03.060
but I got to admit you had me breaking down a little bit for awhile.

182
00:16:04.460 --> 00:16:05.950
Do you see that?

183
00:16:09.400 --> 00:16:10.540
You're probably laughing at me,

184
00:16:12.070 --> 00:16:14.680
so I'm going to come up and see you today.

185
00:16:16.860 --> 00:16:17.693
<v 0>Is that cool?</v>

186
00:16:20.210 --> 00:16:21.920
<v 1>I mean,
it's supposed to be cool.</v>

187
00:16:25.470 --> 00:16:29.400
If nothing else,
just to say goodbye.

188
00:16:32.970 --> 00:16:34.170
I'll bring you a beer or two.

189
00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:41.340
I don't even drink anymore,
but you know what?
If you crack one open with me,

190
00:16:42.630 --> 00:16:43.590
I'll have one with you

191
00:16:46.750 --> 00:16:48.130
like old times.

192
00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:54.400
What happened to those times

193
00:16:59.060 --> 00:17:00.320
we were brothers

194
00:17:04.520 --> 00:17:07.520
and when we came home we knew

195
00:17:09.050 --> 00:17:13.480
we made it.
We've made it,

196
00:17:13.800 --> 00:17:14.633
man.

197
00:17:16.120 --> 00:17:16.840
<v 0>Okay.</v>

198
00:17:16.840 --> 00:17:17.920
<v 1>As crazy it seems.</v>

199
00:17:17.921 --> 00:17:22.000
I was actually never that worried about you.

200
00:17:24.740 --> 00:17:28.340
Maybe you were blessed where maybe you were lucky.

201
00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:31.910
Maybe it was both,
but whatever it was,
it worked.

202
00:17:36.590 --> 00:17:38.990
You even wrote to me during your next appointment,

203
00:17:42.090 --> 00:17:43.260
this is what you wrote.

204
00:17:45.240 --> 00:17:48.930
All I interject is my part,
the firing and yelling,

205
00:17:51.730 --> 00:17:54.340
but the bullets do not hit me.
They never hit me.

206
00:17:54.430 --> 00:17:56.200
They pass through me like a miracle.

207
00:17:59.500 --> 00:18:04.500
Two days ago we drove through a village and knocked all the power lines down and

208
00:18:04.601 --> 00:18:08.710
it was night and the sparks were like incoming RPGs.

209
00:18:10.600 --> 00:18:11.270
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

210
00:18:11.270 --> 00:18:14.540
<v 1>I wished they were 10 braced,</v>

211
00:18:17.390 --> 00:18:18.223
<v 0>but they weren't,</v>

212
00:18:20.020 --> 00:18:22.780
<v 1>and the Iud is won't come either.
They won't hit me.</v>

213
00:18:24.110 --> 00:18:24.940
<v 0>Okay.</v>

214
00:18:24.940 --> 00:18:26.170
<v 1>It's like I'm being</v>

215
00:18:28.200 --> 00:18:29.033
<v 0>protected.</v>

216
00:18:34.510 --> 00:18:38.110
<v 1>You capitalized the P in protected.</v>

217
00:18:41.620 --> 00:18:43.420
You believed it was a higher power.

218
00:18:47.320 --> 00:18:49.540
I can't rightly argue with you on that,

219
00:18:55.520 --> 00:18:56.780
but if that's so true,

220
00:18:59.690 --> 00:19:04.130
how does this happen?
Why did this happen?

221
00:19:04.280 --> 00:19:06.440
Where did that protection go?

222
00:19:09.980 --> 00:19:13.580
Did it abandoned you like you abandoned me?

223
00:19:17.210 --> 00:19:19.040
What am I supposed to do now?

224
00:19:26.380 --> 00:19:27.213
<v 0>You know what?</v>

225
00:19:29.340 --> 00:19:30.750
<v 1>I'm not going to see you today.</v>

226
00:19:33.210 --> 00:19:34.043
<v 0>You can wait.</v>

227
00:19:41.640 --> 00:19:42.473
Yeah.

228
00:19:43.740 --> 00:19:44.573
<v 1>February.</v>

229
00:19:47.940 --> 00:19:52.140
It's a new year.
Let's try this again.

230
00:19:56.330 --> 00:20:01.040
Time heals all wounds.
They say,
so we should be good now,

231
00:20:01.070 --> 00:20:01.903
right?

232
00:20:04.300 --> 00:20:06.400
I should be over it all by now.

233
00:20:08.020 --> 00:20:11.590
I'll come see you and at a minimum say goodbye.

234
00:20:11.740 --> 00:20:16.150
Just just say goodbye.
Just tell you that's it.

235
00:20:17.140 --> 00:20:19.510
No hard feelings.
Don't take it personally.

236
00:20:21.100 --> 00:20:26.100
I've decided I'm gonna go ahead and proceed on down the path without you

237
00:20:30.660 --> 00:20:31.493
alone.

238
00:20:33.750 --> 00:20:34.583
<v 0>Okay.</v>

239
00:20:35.120 --> 00:20:36.430
<v 1>Than I'm used to being alone.</v>

240
00:20:38.260 --> 00:20:41.560
<v 0>No big deal.
I kind of like it,</v>

241
00:20:46.330 --> 00:20:48.640
<v 1>but even I to admit,
it was nice.</v>

242
00:20:51.450 --> 00:20:52.890
Nice to have someone to talk to.

243
00:20:53.070 --> 00:20:55.920
Nice to have someone to talk to without even talking.

244
00:20:59.030 --> 00:21:03.770
Oh look.
A nod.
A smile.

245
00:21:09.590 --> 00:21:11.690
No one is smiling back anymore.

246
00:21:16.510 --> 00:21:17.343
No one.

247
00:21:23.260 --> 00:21:25.450
Sometimes I look up at the night sky

248
00:21:29.580 --> 00:21:31.530
that can approximate a smile.

249
00:21:35.360 --> 00:21:39.560
I see a smile in the sunset.
I don't know why

250
00:21:41.790 --> 00:21:45.240
I tried a milk,
what I can out of every day,

251
00:21:45.241 --> 00:21:47.520
I should be cursing the sunset.

252
00:21:51.410 --> 00:21:52.243
<v 0>Okay.</v>

253
00:21:52.770 --> 00:21:54.900
<v 1>That's sunset means another day has gone.</v>

254
00:21:59.860 --> 00:22:01.540
I shouldn't be cursing it,
but I don't.

255
00:22:04.870 --> 00:22:07.600
I take a few minutes when I can and I watch it.

256
00:22:12.220 --> 00:22:16.510
Good night owl.
Huey.
Good night.

257
00:22:16.660 --> 00:22:21.260
Chesty
good night stoner.

258
00:22:27.200 --> 00:22:31.070
Maybe there's some relief that the day is gone is at it,

259
00:22:31.300 --> 00:22:36.300
that that part of the race is over and there isn't a damn thing I can do about

260
00:22:36.531 --> 00:22:37.364
it.

261
00:22:44.180 --> 00:22:45.980
When my oldest daughter was little,

262
00:22:48.170 --> 00:22:53.170
we would watch the sunset over the ocean when we get the chance.

263
00:22:56.170 --> 00:23:00.050
And she was at that age when she was only just starting to talk,

264
00:23:00.051 --> 00:23:02.450
she could just say a handful of words.

265
00:23:05.230 --> 00:23:06.063
<v 0>Okay.</v>

266
00:23:06.430 --> 00:23:11.200
<v 1>When she wanted a drink of milk,
she would say no.</v>

267
00:23:14.740 --> 00:23:18.250
When she wanted to go on the swing,
she would say being,

268
00:23:22.020 --> 00:23:24.960
when I would throw up her up in the air and catch her,

269
00:23:25.110 --> 00:23:30.000
she would laugh and she would giggle and she would say the word again.

270
00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:37.430
And she and I were sitting on the seawall,

271
00:23:38.660 --> 00:23:43.660
it was autumn and the sun was leaning towards the south and we watched and she

272
00:23:45.591 --> 00:23:49.460
watched
the colors in the sky,

273
00:23:51.360 --> 00:23:53.850
red and yellow and orange,

274
00:23:54.150 --> 00:23:57.750
like fire and the water ignited.

275
00:23:59.290 --> 00:23:59.920
<v 0>Okay.</v>

276
00:23:59.920 --> 00:24:04.920
<v 1>Then it turned black and the sun disappeared into the ocean and she looked up at</v>

277
00:24:06.401 --> 00:24:09.100
me and she said again,

278
00:24:12.670 --> 00:24:13.503
<v 0>yeah,</v>

279
00:24:13.810 --> 00:24:15.250
<v 1>she wanted it back.</v>

280
00:24:19.370 --> 00:24:20.203
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

281
00:24:22.650 --> 00:24:24.510
<v 1>But I couldn't do anything for her.</v>

282
00:24:30.100 --> 00:24:31.340
I was powerless.

283
00:24:35.560 --> 00:24:36.393
I still am.

284
00:24:38.760 --> 00:24:42.150
I can't stop the clock and I can't bring back a day.

285
00:24:42.510 --> 00:24:46.740
Not One single day,
not one single minute.

286
00:24:46.770 --> 00:24:48.480
You get what you get.

287
00:24:52.510 --> 00:24:53.343
<v 0>Okay.</v>

288
00:24:54.480 --> 00:24:57.990
<v 1>And that sunset,
we'll keep a man's ego in check,</v>

289
00:24:58.080 --> 00:25:01.440
especially when you're complete.
Lack of control,

290
00:25:01.560 --> 00:25:04.110
disappoints the little angel sitting on your knee.

291
00:25:12.250 --> 00:25:14.220
And I can't control this situation either

292
00:25:17.370 --> 00:25:18.810
and that stings.

293
00:25:20.890 --> 00:25:21.723
<v 0>Okay.</v>

294
00:25:21.780 --> 00:25:23.130
<v 1>And I don't want to face that.</v>

295
00:25:27.090 --> 00:25:28.260
I don't want to say goodbye.

296
00:25:29.420 --> 00:25:30.253
<v 0>Okay,</v>

297
00:25:30.620 --> 00:25:31.640
<v 1>that can wait.</v>

298
00:25:35.140 --> 00:25:36.010
You can wait.

299
00:25:43.210 --> 00:25:47.820
May
springtime

300
00:25:50.620 --> 00:25:53.920
rebirth.
So I'm told

301
00:25:56.650 --> 00:25:59.950
the winter swell fades,
but the water warms up.

302
00:26:01.930 --> 00:26:03.520
The days get longer again.

303
00:26:08.080 --> 00:26:08.913
<v 0>I like that.</v>

304
00:26:11.570 --> 00:26:13.610
<v 1>I look at more of your words.</v>

305
00:26:16.440 --> 00:26:19.320
The read,
he found us sleeping spot

306
00:26:20.900 --> 00:26:22.970
happy and excited with anticipation.

307
00:26:23.120 --> 00:26:27.710
He thought of the glory which was to come and he slept trank leak and did not

308
00:26:27.711 --> 00:26:28.550
dream

309
00:26:30.910 --> 00:26:34.300
the blue midnight sky held no trace of trouble.

310
00:26:34.390 --> 00:26:38.890
Almost no clouds,
only a wisp of silver,

311
00:26:38.891 --> 00:26:40.240
gray near the moon.

312
00:26:40.390 --> 00:26:45.390
That seemed to be something beautiful for the below to look at as an omen that

313
00:26:46.111 --> 00:26:47.730
something good might happen

314
00:26:49.860 --> 00:26:52.680
as some kind of sign that heaven awaited it.

315
00:26:55.260 --> 00:26:56.093
<v 0>The good thing,</v>

316
00:27:02.620 --> 00:27:04.450
<v 1>the good thing you wrote,</v>

317
00:27:07.370 --> 00:27:09.080
what am I supposed to do with that?

318
00:27:13.050 --> 00:27:14.280
You set me up,

319
00:27:14.430 --> 00:27:18.660
you know with thoughts of the good thing

320
00:27:21.580 --> 00:27:26.520
because there we were,
you know,

321
00:27:26.700 --> 00:27:31.470
we were headed in the right direction toward the good things.

322
00:27:34.940 --> 00:27:36.290
When you listen to me,

323
00:27:36.530 --> 00:27:40.650
things worked out always right.

324
00:27:42.450 --> 00:27:43.610
<v 0>Do you know it?</v>

325
00:27:45.390 --> 00:27:50.130
<v 1>When you listened to me and you put your damn heart in check,</v>

326
00:27:50.160 --> 00:27:52.110
things worked out

327
00:27:54.230 --> 00:27:55.063
<v 0>okay.</v>

328
00:27:55.270 --> 00:27:59.020
<v 1>What's your problem?
You listened to your heart too much.
You know this.</v>

329
00:28:01.890 --> 00:28:05.130
Let your emotions get ahold of you.
You know it's true.

330
00:28:06.720 --> 00:28:09.780
I told you a thousand times,
10,000 times

331
00:28:12.220 --> 00:28:15.880
and you tried to listen and you did listen sometimes,

332
00:28:20.580 --> 00:28:24.870
but your heart couldn't be completely subdued.

333
00:28:24.871 --> 00:28:26.700
It was too strong,

334
00:28:28.700 --> 00:28:30.560
too strong for its own good

335
00:28:35.280 --> 00:28:37.830
and yeah,
I know,

336
00:28:40.290 --> 00:28:43.980
I know.
That's what makes you you

337
00:28:45.250 --> 00:28:46.083
<v 0>fine.</v>

338
00:28:51.730 --> 00:28:53.110
<v 1>But you should have listened to me.</v>

339
00:28:54.990 --> 00:28:57.600
You should have listened

340
00:29:03.170 --> 00:29:08.170
and now I am here and you are there and there is nothing I can do about it.

341
00:29:09.980 --> 00:29:10.813
<v 0>Okay.</v>

342
00:29:13.860 --> 00:29:18.860
<v 1>Powerless July,</v>

343
00:29:27.950 --> 00:29:30.980
full fledged summer.
Now

344
00:29:33.330 --> 00:29:35.960
camp fires and guitar on the regular.

345
00:29:38.920 --> 00:29:39.753
Where are you at?

346
00:29:43.410 --> 00:29:44.460
Let me ask you something.

347
00:29:44.580 --> 00:29:48.300
If you weren't going to come around then can you just let me be,

348
00:29:51.880 --> 00:29:54.310
I don't want you in my head right now.

349
00:29:56.490 --> 00:29:59.910
I don't want to get dragged back.
Every time I strum a cord,

350
00:30:08.460 --> 00:30:09.293
<v 0>I remember</v>

351
00:30:12.270 --> 00:30:15.120
<v 1>we were traveling up the coast.
You May.</v>

352
00:30:16.180 --> 00:30:17.013
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

353
00:30:17.120 --> 00:30:18.530
<v 1>Lazy days.</v>

354
00:30:21.090 --> 00:30:22.620
Surfing by day,

355
00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:26.250
playing on the gift boxes at night.

356
00:30:29.380 --> 00:30:31.060
We were looking for bigger waves.

357
00:30:32.680 --> 00:30:34.510
The kind of waves that get the blood flowing.

358
00:30:37.960 --> 00:30:38.793
<v 0>We found some,</v>

359
00:30:44.190 --> 00:30:45.840
<v 1>but what will we really looking for?</v>

360
00:30:46.230 --> 00:30:47.063
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

361
00:30:49.810 --> 00:30:51.250
<v 1>You know as well as I,</v>

362
00:30:53.350 --> 00:30:55.810
we were looking for that thing.

363
00:30:57.780 --> 00:30:58.613
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

364
00:30:58.710 --> 00:30:59.700
<v 1>That moment,</v>

365
00:31:00.840 --> 00:31:04.260
that moment when nothing else matters.

366
00:31:05.280 --> 00:31:08.970
That moment that is sourced directly from the battlefield.

367
00:31:12.260 --> 00:31:15.680
Hard to find anywhere else.
So we,

368
00:31:15.860 --> 00:31:20.660
we try and get close to it,
Jujitsu,
surfing,

369
00:31:20.750 --> 00:31:24.920
whatever,
but it's hard to replace.
Maybe it can't be replaced.

370
00:31:29.100 --> 00:31:30.960
Maybe it just is what it is.

371
00:31:34.820 --> 00:31:36.230
I think I understood that.

372
00:31:39.440 --> 00:31:40.520
I'm not sure you did.

373
00:31:43.040 --> 00:31:47.420
I was able to rationalize it.
Figure out,
detach from it,

374
00:31:48.290 --> 00:31:49.940
see it from the outside.

375
00:31:53.260 --> 00:31:57.760
Before that trip up the coast,
you had written me.

376
00:31:57.790 --> 00:32:02.440
These words
send us.

377
00:32:03.790 --> 00:32:08.790
We are thirsty for screams and Gore and hell and Dirk and shit.

378
00:32:11.760 --> 00:32:14.490
We will hack our way through scores of bodies,

379
00:32:14.640 --> 00:32:19.230
form them up in a pile and burn them so we can kill by the pyre lights.

380
00:32:21.730 --> 00:32:26.730
Somebody spread the good news that the killers teeth are sharp and their guns

381
00:32:26.771 --> 00:32:29.080
are clean and their souls are dead,

382
00:32:29.140 --> 00:32:34.140
so no one needs anything but victory and sacred deference when is done.

383
00:32:41.740 --> 00:32:43.720
You see that was your heart talking again.

384
00:32:47.320 --> 00:32:50.470
The same heart that wrapped around a girl you met,

385
00:32:50.590 --> 00:32:55.590
the same heart that brought my kids birthday presents the same heart that was

386
00:32:57.440 --> 00:32:59.660
broken by the loss of our friends.

387
00:33:02.910 --> 00:33:07.910
A heart capable of both devotion and destruction.

388
00:33:13.670 --> 00:33:15.320
I told you to let it all go.

389
00:33:18.220 --> 00:33:19.750
I told you,

390
00:33:27.400 --> 00:33:28.900
but I can't control everything.

391
00:33:32.990 --> 00:33:34.370
I'm still powerless.

392
00:33:45.270 --> 00:33:46.103
September.

393
00:33:46.900 --> 00:33:47.733
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

394
00:33:50.830 --> 00:33:52.630
<v 1>a year has passed</v>

395
00:33:55.540 --> 00:33:56.860
or was it yesterday?

396
00:34:00.410 --> 00:34:04.610
Time seems like a trick,
but the trick is on me because it's no trick.

397
00:34:04.611 --> 00:34:08.780
It all time does not waver.
It does not relinquish.

398
00:34:08.900 --> 00:34:11.420
It isn't tricky.
It just is

399
00:34:13.740 --> 00:34:18.740
and it is moving on without judgment and without mercy and it will keep moving.

400
00:34:19.760 --> 00:34:20.593
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

401
00:34:23.620 --> 00:34:25.300
<v 1>I am coming up to see you today.</v>

402
00:34:28.470 --> 00:34:29.303
I have to,

403
00:34:32.660 --> 00:34:34.070
I have to say goodbye.

404
00:34:36.450 --> 00:34:40.920
I can't do it like this anymore.
Carrying you around in my head.

405
00:34:43.880 --> 00:34:48.710
Bringing back the past so often that it's interfering with the present and the

406
00:34:48.711 --> 00:34:50.750
future.
That's not right.

407
00:34:53.250 --> 00:34:54.600
That wasn't part of the deal.

408
00:35:02.940 --> 00:35:05.010
<v 0>I arrive.
Yeah,</v>

409
00:35:09.320 --> 00:35:13.880
<v 1>you're still there.
Where I left you.</v>

410
00:35:17.550 --> 00:35:22.410
I brought you a beer when some wax for your board and a guitar pick.

411
00:35:24.560 --> 00:35:26.180
Even though you played better without one.

412
00:35:30.070 --> 00:35:32.260
I already went and saw Mikey and mark.

413
00:35:37.020 --> 00:35:38.640
<v 0>I save you for last.</v>

414
00:35:42.250 --> 00:35:46.090
<v 1>That's the way it is.
You were the last to go</v>

415
00:35:55.380 --> 00:35:58.260
and this is the way it always ends

416
00:36:01.480 --> 00:36:06.310
here.
It always ends like this

417
00:36:09.750 --> 00:36:11.400
and I will end up here too.

418
00:36:14.790 --> 00:36:15.623
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

419
00:36:16.760 --> 00:36:18.950
<v 1>but I didn't know you'd end up here so soon.</v>

420
00:36:29.950 --> 00:36:30.820
Here's your beer.

421
00:36:33.540 --> 00:36:35.490
I'll pour it in the grass for you.

422
00:36:39.160 --> 00:36:40.840
I'll put this bar of surf.
Wow.

423
00:36:43.150 --> 00:36:44.410
On top of your gravestone,

424
00:36:49.340 --> 00:36:50.840
their guitar pick next to it.

425
00:37:03.740 --> 00:37:07.660
I read the words,
catch dinner.

426
00:37:07.680 --> 00:37:10.040
That white granite rock,

427
00:37:19.230 --> 00:37:21.060
Seth,
a stone

428
00:37:25.780 --> 00:37:26.620
commander,

429
00:37:29.860 --> 00:37:33.730
the u s navy,
Afghanistan,
Iraq.

430
00:37:36.870 --> 00:37:40.380
September 17th,

431
00:37:40.380 --> 00:37:45.240
1976 September 30th,
2017

432
00:37:49.910 --> 00:37:53.090
silver star with oak leaf cluster,

433
00:37:56.040 --> 00:37:58.470
bronze star medal with valor.

434
00:38:03.990 --> 00:38:05.580
Faithful Warrior,

435
00:38:12.350 --> 00:38:15.740
faithful
warrior.

436
00:38:32.370 --> 00:38:34.440
I always tell everyone to carry on

437
00:38:38.220 --> 00:38:40.890
<v 2>to mourn,
but not to dwell,</v>

438
00:38:45.420 --> 00:38:48.930
but now I'm dwelling myself

439
00:38:51.290 --> 00:38:55.660
and I know I shouldn't.
You know I should.

440
00:39:09.440 --> 00:39:10.970
I've thought long and hard about it

441
00:39:16.430 --> 00:39:17.940
and I was going to say goodbye.

442
00:39:22.350 --> 00:39:23.183
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

443
00:39:27.020 --> 00:39:27.980
<v 2>but I'm not going to say it.</v>

444
00:39:34.740 --> 00:39:36.000
There is no need.

445
00:39:37.160 --> 00:39:37.993
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

446
00:39:39.490 --> 00:39:40.420
<v 2>you're still with me.</v>

447
00:39:45.540 --> 00:39:50.540
You're in the ocean and in the sky and the earth beneath my feet.

448
00:39:53.230 --> 00:39:54.063
<v 0>Okay.</v>

449
00:39:59.060 --> 00:40:00.050
<v 2>You're still with me</v>

450
00:40:04.590 --> 00:40:05.670
and I'm good with that.

451
00:40:12.160 --> 00:40:13.630
Here's one more thing you wrote.

452
00:40:28.880 --> 00:40:29.713
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

453
00:40:32.260 --> 00:40:34.630
<v 2>I fought.
The enemy is good as I could.</v>

454
00:40:38.670 --> 00:40:43.110
I lost myself,
but in doing so,
I found myself.

455
00:40:45.770 --> 00:40:46.940
It is a path

456
00:40:49.420 --> 00:40:51.160
you have to work your own one out.

457
00:40:53.890 --> 00:40:54.970
It is a struggle.

458
00:40:59.700 --> 00:41:01.320
I've listened to the truth.

459
00:41:04.260 --> 00:41:06.780
I am humbled and mystified

460
00:41:08.500 --> 00:41:09.820
by this life we live.

461
00:41:20.280 --> 00:41:21.360
That's what you said.

462
00:41:27.750 --> 00:41:29.700
And I will tell you this,
my brother.

463
00:41:32.170 --> 00:41:35.320
<v 0>Yeah.
Hi.</v>

464
00:41:35.550 --> 00:41:38.930
I am humbled and mystified by this life too.

465
00:41:43.250 --> 00:41:46.100
And I am going to keep on living it.

466
00:41:50.300 --> 00:41:54.680
I can't stop the sunsets and I can't bring them back,

467
00:41:54.920 --> 00:41:57.890
but I can make them count.

468
00:42:04.820 --> 00:42:05.653
And that

469
00:42:08.480 --> 00:42:10.010
is what I am going to do.

470
00:42:13.840 --> 00:42:15.560
I am going to keep on living

471
00:42:18.800 --> 00:42:21.920
and I am going to make it

472
00:42:24.500 --> 00:42:25.333
count.

473
00:43:20.330 --> 00:43:21.163
So

474
00:43:27.020 --> 00:43:27.853
here we are

475
00:43:31.670 --> 00:43:32.540
and

476
00:43:34.100 --> 00:43:38.930
speaking of living life

477
00:43:40.580 --> 00:43:42.680
and trying to make it count,

478
00:43:45.950 --> 00:43:49.790
we're doing this gig here tonight.

479
00:43:54.690 --> 00:43:55.523
So

480
00:44:00.260 --> 00:44:04.640
we are live.
We are.
Yeah.
Yeah.

481
00:44:07.190 --> 00:44:12.190
[inaudible]

482
00:44:29.990 --> 00:44:34.470
<v 2>we generally this a rough transition.
Yeah.
Little bit.
Yeah.</v>

483
00:44:37.590 --> 00:44:40.380
So everyone that's here,

484
00:44:40.440 --> 00:44:44.460
our first live podcasts.

485
00:44:45.900 --> 00:44:50.010
Thanks for everyone for thanks to everyone for coming down.

486
00:44:51.780 --> 00:44:52.500
Um,

487
00:44:52.500 --> 00:44:57.500
as I thought about what to talk about tonight,

488
00:44:59.250 --> 00:45:04.250
I went down into a pretty heavy subject

489
00:45:11.180 --> 00:45:12.013
<v 0>and</v>

490
00:45:14.800 --> 00:45:15.131
<v 2>you know,</v>

491
00:45:15.131 --> 00:45:19.900
that's part of what this whole thing is.

492
00:45:20.830 --> 00:45:21.663
Um,

493
00:45:23.170 --> 00:45:28.170
all the people that have reached out to me over the last few years ago that were

494
00:45:28.270 --> 00:45:33.270
able to overcome some tough situation

495
00:45:36.160 --> 00:45:37.690
because of the podcast.

496
00:45:40.320 --> 00:45:41.610
And it's the same with me,

497
00:45:42.360 --> 00:45:47.070
the same lessons that we've learned from the podcast,

498
00:45:47.340 --> 00:45:51.600
from books,
from having people on.
It's the same.

499
00:45:53.010 --> 00:45:57.780
We get the benefit of two.
I get the benefit of that too.
And

500
00:46:02.690 --> 00:46:07.310
here we are.
Here we are.
So

501
00:46:10.580 --> 00:46:14.450
thanks for coming.
Echo Charles.

502
00:46:14.451 --> 00:46:17.060
Thanks for pressing record.

503
00:46:22.230 --> 00:46:22.640
<v 0>Okay.</v>

504
00:46:22.640 --> 00:46:27.080
<v 2>And stopped by the way,
when you got it.
It's a whole,
it's a little thing.</v>

505
00:46:29.390 --> 00:46:30.223
<v 0>And</v>

506
00:46:30.620 --> 00:46:31.453
<v 2>uh,</v>

507
00:46:31.520 --> 00:46:36.020
one of the main things and one of the main reasons I wanted to do a live podcast

508
00:46:36.080 --> 00:46:41.080
is to actually see everyone and give a chance for you to see us and for you to

509
00:46:43.371 --> 00:46:44.840
see what we do and what it looks like.

510
00:46:44.841 --> 00:46:46.790
And this is pretty much what it looks like.
I mean,

511
00:46:46.820 --> 00:46:51.620
we're sitting in a small room and we press record and this is what we do.

512
00:46:52.490 --> 00:46:57.140
And it's great to have everyone here and to see your faces.

513
00:46:57.141 --> 00:47:00.460
And I've talked about this before.
I mean,
when I'm recording,
I,
I,

514
00:47:00.500 --> 00:47:02.720
I'm talking to you.

515
00:47:02.740 --> 00:47:06.730
You know what I'm talking to the people that I've heard from over the past few

516
00:47:06.730 --> 00:47:08.240
years.
I know you're listening.

517
00:47:08.540 --> 00:47:13.490
And even from day one I wanted to,
when people put on their headsets,

518
00:47:13.491 --> 00:47:15.830
I wanted them to think like,
okay,
Yep,
this is,

519
00:47:15.860 --> 00:47:19.970
we're going in and this is it like it's on and I don't want you to waste your

520
00:47:19.971 --> 00:47:24.890
time.
I don't want to want to win.
I don't want to waste your time.
So

521
00:47:27.170 --> 00:47:30.640
that's why we're doing this tonight.
I thank you all for coming.

522
00:47:31.510 --> 00:47:35.470
I also want to take advantage of the fact that you're here to do some live Q
and.

523
00:47:35.471 --> 00:47:38.500
A,
which is very fun for me to do.

524
00:47:38.530 --> 00:47:43.530
I enjoy doing it and we did solicit questions from the ticket sales.

525
00:47:46.980 --> 00:47:50.550
Did I just escalate that?
Yeah,
a little bit.
Yeah,

526
00:47:50.560 --> 00:47:54.930
we did that for ticket sales
answer.

527
00:47:54.970 --> 00:47:58.600
We've got some of those questions here and we'll start off with a couple of

528
00:47:58.601 --> 00:47:59.890
those.
And then we've got,

529
00:47:59.920 --> 00:48:04.240
you can bring the Q and a lights on and then we're going to,

530
00:48:04.241 --> 00:48:05.740
we've got some folks out there,

531
00:48:05.770 --> 00:48:10.090
volunteers with microphones and then once we,
we'll,

532
00:48:10.091 --> 00:48:14.890
we'll open it up and we're gonna we're gonna racked in and answer some
questions.

533
00:48:15.700 --> 00:48:20.080
And I know some of you were waiting to get a picture of weeks to get some stuff

534
00:48:20.081 --> 00:48:24.940
signed before this started and we'll finish this and we'll wrap up that for

535
00:48:24.941 --> 00:48:28.840
everybody here.
So it's awesome that you all are sitting here.

536
00:48:29.020 --> 00:48:33.520
Appreciate you coming down.
And um,
let's do a little Q and.
A.

537
00:48:33.600 --> 00:48:35.850
<v 3>Yeah,
yeah.
All right.
Yeah,</v>

538
00:48:35.851 --> 00:48:40.500
it's interesting cause usually we just sorta see the cameras,

539
00:48:40.530 --> 00:48:42.540
you know,
they're on the other side of the cameras,

540
00:48:44.790 --> 00:48:49.260
but you just see the no,
it's like,
Oh you actually see the peat.
It's different.

541
00:48:49.710 --> 00:48:53.910
It's different.
So,
all right,
first question,

542
00:48:53.970 --> 00:48:58.210
observation.
Will you see what I'm saying?
Like now I look in the camera like,
Oh,

543
00:48:58.770 --> 00:49:03.420
you see what I'm saying?
I'm just saying,
you see the people awesome.

544
00:49:03.990 --> 00:49:05.880
Well,
let's not blow it anymore.

545
00:49:08.950 --> 00:49:13.870
Leaving in the first question.
We can't edit out your stuff.
Right.

546
00:49:16.280 --> 00:49:18.900
All right.
Jocko,

547
00:49:19.290 --> 00:49:24.270
what impresses you the most when you're considering to work with someone or hire

548
00:49:24.271 --> 00:49:27.420
them to be part of your team?
This is a question I get asked all the time.

549
00:49:27.990 --> 00:49:30.810
Everybody wants to know who to hire and what do I look for.

550
00:49:30.840 --> 00:49:34.680
And obviously I look for someone that's humble and I looked for someone that's

551
00:49:34.681 --> 00:49:35.980
balanced,
Eh,

552
00:49:36.200 --> 00:49:37.510
<v 2>and really,
you know,</v>

553
00:49:37.700 --> 00:49:42.700
it's one of those things where as much as you can before you hire someone,

554
00:49:43.190 --> 00:49:44.030
get to know them.

555
00:49:44.150 --> 00:49:47.120
And the advice we give people a national on front all the time when they're

556
00:49:47.121 --> 00:49:52.070
looking to hire someone,
as we say,
look,
if you can hire them temporarily,

557
00:49:52.071 --> 00:49:53.780
bring them on as a contractor for 90 days.

558
00:49:53.810 --> 00:49:57.080
You have to see them in the environment that they're actually going into.

559
00:49:57.110 --> 00:50:00.710
They're going to be working in before you know what they're really gonna be
like.

560
00:50:00.980 --> 00:50:04.550
Because just like going through the screen,

561
00:50:04.551 --> 00:50:06.890
people like crazy to go into seal training and it,

562
00:50:06.920 --> 00:50:08.870
they can't tell who's gonna make it and who's not.
Gonna make it.

563
00:50:08.871 --> 00:50:12.830
They just can't tell and they you,

564
00:50:12.831 --> 00:50:16.480
you work with people in the seal teams and you think you know what they're going

565
00:50:16.481 --> 00:50:19.520
to be like when you go into combat,
but you just can't tell you.

566
00:50:19.521 --> 00:50:21.650
You can have a decent idea,
but you just can't tell.

567
00:50:21.980 --> 00:50:25.280
And so if you get the opportunity or the best way to do it is try and bring

568
00:50:25.281 --> 00:50:28.670
people on board in a manner so you get to know him better.

569
00:50:28.790 --> 00:50:29.840
And then once you know them,

570
00:50:30.080 --> 00:50:34.710
you can either hire them or you can get rid of them easily.
Next question,

571
00:50:34.711 --> 00:50:38.620
make sense
Jocko?

572
00:50:40.100 --> 00:50:43.850
<v 3>For a new entrepreneur or someone new to a leadership position,</v>

573
00:50:43.851 --> 00:50:48.620
who is meeting with their employees or direct report or direct reports for the

574
00:50:48.621 --> 00:50:53.420
first time,
what are some key things to address during that initial conversation?

575
00:50:54.090 --> 00:50:58.380
<v 2>As soon as you meet someone that's going to be working for you,</v>

576
00:50:59.940 --> 00:51:02.970
you're immediately make an impression.
So we want to make a good impression.

577
00:51:03.300 --> 00:51:06.530
We also don't want to go,
okay.
It's a,

578
00:51:06.540 --> 00:51:10.260
it's a dichotomy because you're immediately building a relationship with them,

579
00:51:10.530 --> 00:51:15.420
but you can't go overboard and be all buddy buddy with them.

580
00:51:15.421 --> 00:51:18.450
That's why I followed the Hackworth model and I actually took that to the next

581
00:51:18.451 --> 00:51:19.020
level.

582
00:51:19.020 --> 00:51:23.550
Hackworth wouldn't like laugh and joke around with the troops for six weeks.

583
00:51:24.540 --> 00:51:28.480
I upped that to eight weeks cause I'm a little bit more hardcore.
Yeah.

584
00:51:29.310 --> 00:51:30.990
So you,
but,

585
00:51:30.991 --> 00:51:35.220
but one thing that's good out of the gate is put out some brief general

586
00:51:35.221 --> 00:51:39.870
guidelines,
like some,
some of the most broad guidance that you can possibly give,

587
00:51:39.900 --> 00:51:43.470
which is,
hey look,
here's what's important to me.
We're going to do a great job.

588
00:51:43.530 --> 00:51:46.830
We're going to work hard and this is our mission and this is what we're going to

589
00:51:46.831 --> 00:51:48.540
focus on.
And that's it.

590
00:51:48.570 --> 00:51:52.170
You don't need to come out of the gate trying to show everyone that you're the

591
00:51:52.171 --> 00:51:55.920
murderer.
You don't need to do that.
Guess what?
You're the boss.

592
00:51:55.950 --> 00:51:58.110
You actually defacto are the man.

593
00:51:58.470 --> 00:52:02.730
So don't run around and try and prove yourself out of the gate.

594
00:52:03.700 --> 00:52:06.970
Get to know him,
let that relationship builds over time.

595
00:52:07.390 --> 00:52:10.240
And that's what we're going to end up in the best situation.
Makes Sense.

596
00:52:10.840 --> 00:52:13.520
You sort of did that to me.
Even as friends

597
00:52:16.030 --> 00:52:20.320
like here.
Yeah.
Good to meet you.
Here's you.
Good to meet you.

598
00:52:20.860 --> 00:52:24.940
Eight weeks.
Just like that next question.

599
00:52:27.230 --> 00:52:31.180
Yeah.
Well it's funny too,

600
00:52:31.181 --> 00:52:35.930
cause now when I meet people,
like tonight,
I'm all nice to everyone now.
Yeah,

601
00:52:36.010 --> 00:52:38.700
he changed.
But if I was going to be like

602
00:52:38.740 --> 00:52:42.260
<v 3>getting in the game with them and somehow make cold blooded,</v>

603
00:52:43.880 --> 00:52:47.560
that eight week probationary Jocko period.

604
00:52:48.520 --> 00:52:52.780
Who are some of the well known leaders today who you believe best exemplify

605
00:52:52.781 --> 00:52:56.080
extreme ownership?
Be it in politics,
military or business.

606
00:52:58.850 --> 00:53:02.270
<v 2>Uh,
military.
You know,
obviously I like,
I like Madison a lot by matter of fact,</v>

607
00:53:02.271 --> 00:53:05.590
I'd like madness.
Yeah.
Thank you.

608
00:53:08.900 --> 00:53:13.130
I I general Kelly,
same thing.
Yup.
And McMaster,
same thing.

609
00:53:13.131 --> 00:53:14.180
All those guys are awesome.

610
00:53:14.181 --> 00:53:18.280
A chrome macfarlane or general macfarlane who just retired who I worked before

611
00:53:18.281 --> 00:53:22.550
and Remati who is awesome.
So there's a lot of really good military examples.

612
00:53:22.551 --> 00:53:27.150
The business examples.
There's a,
uh,
lolly who turned around Ford.

613
00:53:27.180 --> 00:53:31.560
There's a great book called American icon and it's a great leadership book.

614
00:53:31.740 --> 00:53:33.540
I actually was going to cover it,

615
00:53:34.110 --> 00:53:38.730
but I never did because it's hard to cover books about business compared to

616
00:53:38.731 --> 00:53:42.630
books about combat,
but it's a really good book.
American icon,
great ownership,

617
00:53:42.670 --> 00:53:45.330
great attitude,
and politics.

618
00:53:45.370 --> 00:53:46.660
<v 4>Six.
Okay.</v>

619
00:53:47.130 --> 00:53:50.400
<v 2>This was a super hard one,
but then I just thought,
oh,
Dan Crenshaw,</v>

620
00:53:54.390 --> 00:53:58.410
and really
just the way Dan,

621
00:53:58.411 --> 00:54:01.960
since he's taken position,
like he's just doing a great job.
It's very,

622
00:54:01.980 --> 00:54:05.370
very cool to see.
So yeah,
there you go.
What else?

623
00:54:09.380 --> 00:54:13.490
<v 4>Go to four.
Cool.
Hi Jocko.
An Echo.</v>

624
00:54:13.590 --> 00:54:15.210
<v 3>I recently read the book marine,</v>

625
00:54:15.240 --> 00:54:19.530
the life of chesty puller and in the book chesty references and the unnecessary

626
00:54:19.531 --> 00:54:23.700
loads of administrative paperwork that was required to be prepared for the

627
00:54:23.701 --> 00:54:27.480
military.
I also recently remember on it on a recent podcast,

628
00:54:27.481 --> 00:54:32.481
you recalling a situation in Ramadi where your platoon leaders were not thrilled

629
00:54:33.271 --> 00:54:34.710
to fill out required paperwork.

630
00:54:35.190 --> 00:54:40.170
I'm a squad sergeant in a prominent American police department and I'm

631
00:54:40.200 --> 00:54:45.200
experiencing the same dilemma of micro managing and oversight is extreme and up

632
00:54:45.571 --> 00:54:49.440
to in,
it's taken a toll on the morale of the officer's citywide.

633
00:54:49.710 --> 00:54:54.710
The tedious paperwork and constant micro managing is preventing good cups from

634
00:54:54.871 --> 00:54:58.620
being proactive.
I feel like the job,
quote unquote,

635
00:54:59.250 --> 00:55:01.230
has changed beyond recognition.

636
00:55:01.830 --> 00:55:05.730
I'd appreciate your advice on how to approach the bullshit paperwork

637
00:55:07.260 --> 00:55:11.430
and increase the morale of my cops.
Thank you for your time.

638
00:55:12.290 --> 00:55:15.920
<v 2>Okay,
so what would I do in this situation?</v>

639
00:55:17.150 --> 00:55:21.590
First of all,
I am going to be awesome at the paperwork.

640
00:55:21.950 --> 00:55:26.870
I'm going to do it so well that,
because if you blow off the paperwork,

641
00:55:27.140 --> 00:55:30.170
then you go to your boss and say the paperwork socks and it's not any good.

642
00:55:30.171 --> 00:55:32.090
The guy looks at you and says,
Oh,
you know what?

643
00:55:32.091 --> 00:55:33.730
You don't even know how to do the paperwork.
How do you know if it's,

644
00:55:34.040 --> 00:55:37.070
how do you know if it's hard or not?
So what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna do,

645
00:55:37.670 --> 00:55:39.860
I'm gonna Start building a case.
That's what I'm going to do.

646
00:55:40.160 --> 00:55:41.420
So I'm going to do the paperwork.

647
00:55:41.421 --> 00:55:44.810
I'm actually going to log down how many hours I put into the paperwork.

648
00:55:44.840 --> 00:55:48.740
I'm going to follow that paperwork and see where it goes and see if anyone

649
00:55:48.741 --> 00:55:51.680
actually reads it right.
Cause if I can go to my boss and say,
Hey,

650
00:55:51.681 --> 00:55:56.681
I spent 28 hours a week filing this paperwork and no,

651
00:55:57.050 --> 00:55:58.550
not one single person read it.

652
00:55:58.760 --> 00:56:01.910
And then you take the manpower of everyone in the department and then what you

653
00:56:01.911 --> 00:56:04.850
do is you actually build a case.
When you go in to talk to the boss,

654
00:56:04.880 --> 00:56:09.880
you should have a full magazine of ammunition to combat this paperwork that

655
00:56:12.351 --> 00:56:13.490
you're being forced to do.

656
00:56:13.520 --> 00:56:16.130
You have to be able to explain it to them in a rational,

657
00:56:16.160 --> 00:56:18.320
logical manner and you can't,

658
00:56:19.240 --> 00:56:19.620
<v 4>okay.</v>

659
00:56:19.620 --> 00:56:22.950
<v 2>You can't make any headway against your,</v>

660
00:56:23.770 --> 00:56:26.110
if you are trying to fight from the low ground,

661
00:56:26.780 --> 00:56:30.730
the low ground is why don't really turn in the paperwork and I don't really do

662
00:56:30.731 --> 00:56:32.950
the paperwork and I think the paperwork is crap.

663
00:56:33.550 --> 00:56:35.860
Then they're looking down on you.
What are you talking about?
How are you?

664
00:56:35.861 --> 00:56:39.310
Dare you say that you don't even do it.
You don't even know what you're doing.

665
00:56:40.060 --> 00:56:43.090
You've got to get on the high ground.
How do you get on the high ground?

666
00:56:43.720 --> 00:56:46.330
You get all that stuff done to the best of your ability.

667
00:56:46.331 --> 00:56:48.340
You logged down the hours it takes.

668
00:56:48.370 --> 00:56:51.130
You get your whole little team doing it and you tell your whole team,
hey look,

669
00:56:51.131 --> 00:56:54.550
I know this is painful right now.
Everyone in this squad,

670
00:56:54.551 --> 00:56:57.130
everyone in this platoon is going to do all this.

671
00:56:57.131 --> 00:57:00.970
We're going to lock down what it takes because I am going to bring a solid case

672
00:57:01.060 --> 00:57:05.410
up the chain of command of where we need to limit this paperwork.

673
00:57:06.070 --> 00:57:07.990
This is a long war situation.

674
00:57:08.170 --> 00:57:11.380
You know how long it took to build up all that paperwork.
It took years.

675
00:57:11.410 --> 00:57:14.620
It took 20 years,
30 years for that to happen.

676
00:57:15.100 --> 00:57:19.270
I used to joke about the marines,
the navy seal teams,
the range,

677
00:57:19.271 --> 00:57:21.460
our range procedures are super loose.

678
00:57:21.461 --> 00:57:25.570
We go out there and we shoot like crazy and do all kinds of really dynamic

679
00:57:25.571 --> 00:57:27.860
things and we'd sometimes go to a Marine Corps range.

680
00:57:27.861 --> 00:57:32.740
It was like everything was super tight and I would tell my guys and say,

681
00:57:32.741 --> 00:57:37.030
look,
that's because that happened over years.
One mistake happens.

682
00:57:37.031 --> 00:57:38.740
How do you stop that mistake from happening again?

683
00:57:39.010 --> 00:57:41.560
Put a rule in place that stops it.
Another mistakes happen,

684
00:57:41.620 --> 00:57:45.010
another mistake happens.
Put another rule in place,
another mistake happens.

685
00:57:45.040 --> 00:57:47.410
Put a piece,
a piece of paper to stop it from happening again.

686
00:57:47.560 --> 00:57:50.620
And eventually you end up with a range that's barely even usable.

687
00:57:51.130 --> 00:57:52.990
So that's what happened in this department.

688
00:57:53.500 --> 00:57:57.130
There was little things that happened over time and they build and they build

689
00:57:57.131 --> 00:57:58.720
upon themselves and the next thing you know,

690
00:57:58.721 --> 00:58:03.310
you can't even recognize what your actual job was.
So we have to it.

691
00:58:03.340 --> 00:58:05.290
So that took 20 years to happen.

692
00:58:05.410 --> 00:58:10.410
You're not going to undo it overnight and you're definitely not going to undo it

693
00:58:10.510 --> 00:58:13.540
from the low ground.
You have to get the high ground,

694
00:58:13.780 --> 00:58:18.400
you have to be a performer.
If you're not a performer,

695
00:58:18.540 --> 00:58:23.380
you have no say,
do your job,
do it well,

696
00:58:23.410 --> 00:58:24.340
fight a long war.

697
00:58:26.610 --> 00:58:31.610
[inaudible]

698
00:58:32.850 --> 00:58:36.130
I'm all of a sudden thinking like maybe we need one of those little applause

699
00:58:36.131 --> 00:58:40.690
tracks,
you know,
when I answer a question,

700
00:58:41.430 --> 00:58:44.820
when is good man.
Good.
Uh,

701
00:58:45.970 --> 00:58:46.990
next question.

702
00:58:49.480 --> 00:58:54.010
What book has had the biggest impact on you and is a must read?

703
00:58:59.940 --> 00:59:04.240
Yeah,
I'll face Hackworth.
Thanks for coming.
Welcome to the club.

704
00:59:05.490 --> 00:59:07.300
All right,
good on.

705
00:59:11.020 --> 00:59:15.610
Okay,
next question.
Good morning.
Was that like I'm in a rock and roll band.

706
00:59:15.611 --> 00:59:20.440
Just lets the crowd sing the chorus a little bit,
little bit.

707
00:59:21.710 --> 00:59:25.400
If you did not join the military,
what do you think you'd be doing right now?

708
00:59:27.580 --> 00:59:32.580
<v 1>I think I would have ended up either in the Police Department or a firefighter.</v>

709
00:59:33.820 --> 00:59:37.060
That's what I think I would've done if I couldn't have gotten into the military.

710
00:59:37.090 --> 00:59:39.190
That's probably what I would end up doing.
Y

711
00:59:40.130 --> 00:59:44.630
<v 2>just because I had the urge to serve</v>

712
00:59:45.960 --> 00:59:50.960
<v 1>and do something physical and do something where I'm helping protect people.</v>

713
00:59:53.250 --> 00:59:57.180
I think that's why.
Yeah.
So I know there's a lot of cops and firefighters here,

714
00:59:57.181 --> 01:00:00.510
so thanks for what you do.

715
01:00:01.180 --> 01:00:06.180
<v 0>[inaudible]</v>

716
01:00:13.790 --> 01:00:17.750
<v 2>what is the relationship between humility and vulnerability?</v>

717
01:00:21.940 --> 01:00:22.560
<v 0>Okay.</v>

718
01:00:22.560 --> 01:00:26.670
<v 2>The relationship between humility and vulnerability.</v>

719
01:00:27.420 --> 01:00:28.410
Okay,
interesting.

720
01:00:28.800 --> 01:00:33.800
And there's an interesting dynamic that you get going on when you,

721
01:00:35.410 --> 01:00:36.110
<v 0>yeah,</v>

722
01:00:36.110 --> 01:00:39.320
<v 2>when you're humble.
Okay,
so let's think about what happens when you're humble.</v>

723
01:00:39.710 --> 01:00:41.960
When you're humble,
you expose your vulnerabilities.

724
01:00:42.950 --> 01:00:47.630
But what's cool is when you expose your vulnerabilities,

725
01:00:48.800 --> 01:00:50.870
they become less vulnerable.

726
01:00:52.910 --> 01:00:54.650
So that's why being humble as a win,

727
01:00:55.400 --> 01:00:59.990
because if I'm taking over a position and I don't know how to do one of the

728
01:00:59.991 --> 01:01:04.820
jobs,
if I hide it,
it's haunting me,

729
01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:07.850
right?
And it's a weakness because as soon as it gets exposed,

730
01:01:07.851 --> 01:01:10.220
I'm going to look like you know,
week and a loser.

731
01:01:11.180 --> 01:01:15.710
But if I have a vulnerability and I'm humble enough to expose my vulnerability

732
01:01:15.860 --> 01:01:17.600
and say,
Hey,
you know what guys?

733
01:01:17.660 --> 01:01:20.630
I haven't actually done this before in my old unit,
we didn't never did this,

734
01:01:20.631 --> 01:01:23.990
and I don't know how to do it.
Can I get some help here?
There I'm being humble,

735
01:01:24.050 --> 01:01:25.880
I'm exposing my vulnerability,

736
01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:30.930
and all of a sudden it's not a vulnerability anymore because the,

737
01:01:31.220 --> 01:01:33.500
because my team actually knows it and guess what?

738
01:01:33.501 --> 01:01:38.501
Then I get to practice and learn about the thing that was making me vulnerable.

739
01:01:40.400 --> 01:01:43.490
So vulgar,
making yourself vulnerable is fine,

740
01:01:43.520 --> 01:01:47.300
and if you want to kill your vulnerabilities,
you have to,

741
01:01:48.220 --> 01:01:48.770
<v 0>okay.</v>

742
01:01:48.770 --> 01:01:53.420
<v 2>Be Humble enough to expose them voluntarily,
voluntarily.</v>

743
01:01:53.421 --> 01:01:58.421
Exposing your vulnerabilities is infinitely better than hiding them and letting

744
01:02:00.201 --> 01:02:02.950
them be uncovered by the

745
01:02:04.530 --> 01:02:08.510
seal teams.
That's what it is.
It's,
it's,

746
01:02:08.600 --> 01:02:11.900
it's animals.
Like everyone else in your platoon,

747
01:02:11.901 --> 01:02:14.750
if you have a vulnerability and you hide it and then they get it,

748
01:02:16.250 --> 01:02:21.070
like they're coming at you
with daggers,
with knives and they're going to,

749
01:02:22.530 --> 01:02:27.510
so if you say,
hey,
this is the situation,
expose those vulnerability.

750
01:02:27.840 --> 01:02:31.590
Be Humble enough to do that.
You'll be in a much better position.
Yeah.

751
01:02:31.710 --> 01:02:33.480
And it seems like the leader,

752
01:02:34.050 --> 01:02:37.060
like if you're the boss and you're trying to make like,
oh yeah,

753
01:02:37.061 --> 01:02:40.350
I know everything.
And then like I said,
they,
they find it,

754
01:02:40.351 --> 01:02:41.640
you look way more stupid.

755
01:02:42.270 --> 01:02:46.410
Like in the beginning it feels like you looks more stupid in the beginning I

756
01:02:46.411 --> 01:02:50.370
would think anyway.
Like,
aw,
I'm the boss,
I suppose to know all this stuff.
Yeah.

757
01:02:50.790 --> 01:02:53.640
I think the key point of that is way more stupid.

758
01:02:55.530 --> 01:02:58.890
You don't want to look like that?
I don't think so in there anyway.

759
01:03:00.260 --> 01:03:02.880
All right.
I'm going to go back to this other one,
three dinner,

760
01:03:02.881 --> 01:03:05.880
guests living or dead and why

761
01:03:10.020 --> 01:03:12.360
three dinner guests living or dead?

762
01:03:12.580 --> 01:03:13.413
<v 0>Uh,</v>

763
01:03:14.690 --> 01:03:17.210
<v 2>Mark Lee.
Mike Months.
Brian.
Joe.</v>

764
01:03:18.180 --> 01:03:19.013
<v 0>Okay.</v>

765
01:03:19.020 --> 01:03:24.020
[inaudible]

766
01:03:28.650 --> 01:03:30.600
<v 2>how did you get the nickname Jocko?</v>

767
01:03:34.130 --> 01:03:38.450
I answered this on Facebook live.
Not fully though.
I didn't know fully.

768
01:03:39.470 --> 01:03:44.060
Anyways,
before I was born,
my dad wanted me to be a jock.
My Dad's name is John.

769
01:03:44.090 --> 01:03:47.900
My Dad's nickname is John.
No.
My Dad wanted me to be a jock.

770
01:03:47.960 --> 01:03:52.400
My mom calls my Dad Johnno.
My Dad said,

771
01:03:52.401 --> 01:03:55.340
I hope he's a jock.
My mom said a jock.
Oh,

772
01:03:58.060 --> 01:03:58.893
<v 0>good.</v>

773
01:03:59.860 --> 01:04:03.430
<v 2>Yeah.
I don't think you said that whole thing.
No,
that's the deal.</v>

774
01:04:03.580 --> 01:04:06.380
And then I actually,
when I said that,
my mom said,

775
01:04:06.460 --> 01:04:10.960
actually my dad was nicknamed John.
Oh,

776
01:04:10.961 --> 01:04:11.830
not by her,

777
01:04:11.831 --> 01:04:16.831
but by his family because he was named after his uncle whose name was John Ogle

778
01:04:20.150 --> 01:04:24.700
fork or something like that.
Yeah,
man,
it goes deep.
There you go.

779
01:04:28.680 --> 01:04:29.513
<v 0>Right.</v>

780
01:04:30.060 --> 01:04:31.130
<v 2>Question for Jocko.</v>

781
01:04:31.170 --> 01:04:34.890
Do you teach your wife about being strategic and how open is she?

782
01:04:38.170 --> 01:04:41.920
How open is she that having her husband beat her teacher?

783
01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:46.690
That's a good one.
That's a,
that's a,
that's,
that's a good one for who?

784
01:04:46.780 --> 01:04:48.820
<v 0>For,
for,
for,
for</v>

785
01:04:49.100 --> 01:04:52.430
<v 2>ruining my life.
It's,
it's a good one for me.
For sure.</v>

786
01:04:54.530 --> 01:04:55.363
Okay.

787
01:05:05.010 --> 01:05:05.843
<v 0>Okay.</v>

788
01:05:06.410 --> 01:05:09.260
<v 2>First of all,
let's assess this.</v>

789
01:05:10.010 --> 01:05:13.730
How many people,
just people,
we're not even talking spouses.

790
01:05:13.760 --> 01:05:18.280
How many people are just super open to being taught?

791
01:05:19.090 --> 01:05:20.950
Like if I was like,
let me teach you all something

792
01:05:23.910 --> 01:05:26.560
that already starts off on a bad footing because it implies that I know

793
01:05:26.561 --> 01:05:29.680
something you don't know,
I can help you.
You're,
you're,

794
01:05:29.681 --> 01:05:31.690
you're s inferior to me.

795
01:05:31.720 --> 01:05:34.900
You lack the knowledge that I have.

796
01:05:36.190 --> 01:05:40.420
Clearly I must instruct you in a strategic ways,
right?

797
01:05:41.370 --> 01:05:46.360
Lily.
Okay.
And if that's not offensive to someone,
it is offensive to my wife.

798
01:05:49.410 --> 01:05:53.730
Uh,
so do I sit around and,

799
01:05:54.400 --> 01:05:58.860
you know,
trying to teach my wife,
you know,
here's the deal.
Here's the deal.

800
01:06:00.840 --> 01:06:04.350
When we're dealing with our kids,
I absolutely do this.
Now that I think about it,

801
01:06:04.830 --> 01:06:06.510
you know,
I'll say to my wife,
hey listen,

802
01:06:07.110 --> 01:06:11.490
oh the boys doing this and you're trying to do this.

803
01:06:11.520 --> 01:06:15.900
Don't do that.
All you're doing is,
you know,
it's Oh he wants,

804
01:06:15.901 --> 01:06:20.160
he wants to get all crazy cool,
do this.
You're trying to combat,

805
01:06:20.220 --> 01:06:22.710
I used to tell you this when,
when the kids were really small,

806
01:06:22.770 --> 01:06:27.770
cause she's super nice and concerned and wants to make things right and wants to

807
01:06:31.651 --> 01:06:33.060
win arguments,

808
01:06:34.050 --> 01:06:37.830
which when you're trying to win a logical argument with a four year old,

809
01:06:37.880 --> 01:06:40.080
doesn't work,
doesn't work.
And I say,
look,

810
01:06:40.081 --> 01:06:41.940
you're arguing logic with a four year old.

811
01:06:42.180 --> 01:06:44.400
So I think there's an appropriate time to do it.

812
01:06:44.400 --> 01:06:47.910
You have to be careful that you're not trying to,
you know,

813
01:06:47.911 --> 01:06:51.690
be the superior human with,
oh Mr Strategy,

814
01:06:51.691 --> 01:06:53.250
you want to teach me something about cats,

815
01:06:55.890 --> 01:06:58.650
so take it easy.
And all that being said,

816
01:06:58.710 --> 01:07:03.710
I do have strategic conversations with my wife about the family team,

817
01:07:06.510 --> 01:07:10.860
right?
Like we're a business like left your house and your family has a business,

818
01:07:10.920 --> 01:07:15.810
you have income,
you have expenditures,
you have longterm strategic goals.

819
01:07:16.050 --> 01:07:18.390
So those kinds of things we talk about and you know,

820
01:07:18.391 --> 01:07:22.020
I'm the one that's sort of is usually saying,
hey,
what about this strategic goal?

821
01:07:22.230 --> 01:07:23.850
What are you doing over here?
What do you wanna do that?

822
01:07:23.851 --> 01:07:25.230
So we have those conversations,

823
01:07:25.231 --> 01:07:29.970
but not so much me saying how but me,

824
01:07:30.210 --> 01:07:34.850
you know,
US figuring out where we're going together.
Life.

825
01:07:37.300 --> 01:07:40.750
Does she ever like teach you how to be strategic in any way?

826
01:07:40.751 --> 01:07:43.000
Like be more sensitive or anything like that,

827
01:07:48.090 --> 01:07:48.923
bro.
You serious?

828
01:07:51.160 --> 01:07:51.993
<v 0>Okay.</v>

829
01:07:52.020 --> 01:07:52.790
<v 2>No,
actually my,</v>

830
01:07:52.790 --> 01:07:57.790
the cool thing about my wife is she knows me really well and accepts.

831
01:08:01.530 --> 01:08:05.010
There's uphold deal.
She accepts the shortfalls.

832
01:08:05.040 --> 01:08:09.480
She knows that she got what she got and she rolled the dice.
Hey,
sorry.

833
01:08:12.140 --> 01:08:14.940
Hey,
next wish.

834
01:08:14.990 --> 01:08:19.400
Can you share how someone that is introverted and has social anxiety can become

835
01:08:19.401 --> 01:08:23.840
a leader?
I mean,
first of all,

836
01:08:23.841 --> 01:08:28.610
if you've got social anxiety,
you need to go through that exposure therapy,

837
01:08:29.630 --> 01:08:34.310
which is what I wrote about in way the warrior kid that I didn't know I was

838
01:08:34.311 --> 01:08:34.761
writing about it.

839
01:08:34.761 --> 01:08:39.260
I didn't know it was an actual psychological methodology until Jordan Peterson

840
01:08:39.261 --> 01:08:41.030
was explaining to me that,
well,

841
01:08:41.031 --> 01:08:43.310
what you do with someone in this situation is you give them small exposure.

842
01:08:43.311 --> 01:08:45.420
I was like,
oh,
that's what happens in a way of the warrior kid.
Yeah,

843
01:08:45.550 --> 01:08:49.820
I'm smarter than I thought.
So you can do the same thing with the social anxiety.

844
01:08:49.820 --> 01:08:52.010
You know,
you start talking in front of small groups,
you grow,

845
01:08:52.011 --> 01:08:53.540
you get out and hang out with people and you,

846
01:08:53.570 --> 01:08:56.270
you continue to do that until you get more comfortable.
So you can,

847
01:08:56.480 --> 01:08:58.460
you can sort of overcome that.

848
01:08:59.780 --> 01:09:04.040
And it's the same thing with being introverted.
Now there,

849
01:09:04.910 --> 01:09:09.020
there are leaders that are more introverted.

850
01:09:09.860 --> 01:09:14.860
But what you have to do is you have to bring people onto your team to compliment

851
01:09:16.430 --> 01:09:20.690
that area where you're a little bit weak.

852
01:09:20.750 --> 01:09:24.680
So if,
if you're a leader,
guess what you have to do?

853
01:09:24.710 --> 01:09:27.290
You have to communicate to other human beings and sometimes you have to

854
01:09:27.291 --> 01:09:30.350
communicate,
communicate to other human beings in large groups.

855
01:09:30.380 --> 01:09:33.080
That's what happens.
That's what a leader does.
Sure.

856
01:09:33.081 --> 01:09:34.990
Sometimes it can be on the phone and sometimes it can be on email.

857
01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:37.460
Sometimes it can be in radio over the radio.

858
01:09:37.820 --> 01:09:40.550
But there's times where you're going to have to communicate to the people that

859
01:09:40.551 --> 01:09:41.450
you're leading.

860
01:09:41.870 --> 01:09:46.870
So if you're super introverted and uncomfortable with that and it's a challenge,

861
01:09:47.660 --> 01:09:50.270
you're going to have to overcome that challenge.
Yes,

862
01:09:50.300 --> 01:09:52.970
you can get better at it through practice,

863
01:09:53.810 --> 01:09:58.810
but some people are not going to ever get a really comfortable,

864
01:09:59.390 --> 01:10:02.630
some people are never going to get really comfortable talking in front of a

865
01:10:02.631 --> 01:10:03.464
group.

866
01:10:03.830 --> 01:10:08.630
And so what you do in that situation is you bring someone in your team that is

867
01:10:08.631 --> 01:10:13.631
really good at it and then when it's time to address the troops,

868
01:10:14.110 --> 01:10:16.970
you,
you know,
you as the leader stand up and say,

869
01:10:17.390 --> 01:10:20.270
here's the two things I'm worried about on this operation.

870
01:10:20.570 --> 01:10:21.890
Here's where we're heading.

871
01:10:22.340 --> 01:10:25.010
And now bill's going to brief you on the details of the plan.

872
01:10:26.690 --> 01:10:29.750
And that's fine because bill's a loud mouth and bill's going to get up there and

873
01:10:29.780 --> 01:10:31.940
communicate really clearly and that's going to be great.

874
01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:36.110
And you still gave enough as the figurehead and as the leader of the

875
01:10:36.111 --> 01:10:39.830
organization that people go,
okay,
Yep,
we heard from Jocko,
you know,

876
01:10:39.860 --> 01:10:43.520
he put out the word,
he didn't say much.
It doesn't even seem like he has to,
we,

877
01:10:43.580 --> 01:10:44.600
we hear where he's coming from.

878
01:10:45.110 --> 01:10:48.920
So you just have to build a team that's going to compliment your weaknesses.

879
01:10:49.100 --> 01:10:51.410
And you know,
generally if you're introverted,

880
01:10:51.411 --> 01:10:54.980
well that means you're good at some other thing that that loud mouth isn't good

881
01:10:54.981 --> 01:10:59.350
at,
right?
The loud mouth,
the roots go in the front door,
kick it down,

882
01:10:59.660 --> 01:11:01.850
and he doesn't have any sort of

883
01:11:03.590 --> 01:11:06.290
tactical sense of how to run an operation smoothly.

884
01:11:07.040 --> 01:11:11.690
So you come up with a good plan and then you brief it to bill,

885
01:11:11.870 --> 01:11:13.770
loud mouth bill,
and then you say,
Bill,

886
01:11:13.830 --> 01:11:15.630
we're going to brief the troops and then you make it happen.

887
01:11:16.110 --> 01:11:17.910
So you have to do a little bit of both.

888
01:11:17.911 --> 01:11:21.900
You have to improve your personal skills would you can do through exposure and

889
01:11:21.901 --> 01:11:26.340
practice.
Don't get up and talk about things that you don't know.

890
01:11:27.360 --> 01:11:29.880
Get up and talk about things that you do know that you're are comfortable with

891
01:11:30.210 --> 01:11:33.420
and you practice and while you're practicing,

892
01:11:33.421 --> 01:11:34.620
while you're getting a better at that,

893
01:11:34.621 --> 01:11:38.610
you also build a team where you compliment your own weaknesses and we all have

894
01:11:38.611 --> 01:11:41.420
leadership weaknesses and you've got to build teams that can complement that.

895
01:11:45.300 --> 01:11:46.133
<v 4>Yeah,</v>

896
01:11:46.500 --> 01:11:50.940
<v 3>agree.
I'm glad.
Next question.</v>

897
01:11:52.350 --> 01:11:55.980
How can one guide or lead a leader above you,

898
01:11:56.040 --> 01:12:00.540
especially when you're many links away on the chain of command or many links wet

899
01:12:00.541 --> 01:12:02.320
down the chain of command.

900
01:12:05.650 --> 01:12:07.310
<v 4>Oh,
so,
okay.</v>

901
01:12:07.560 --> 01:12:08.371
<v 2>You want a guide,</v>

902
01:12:08.371 --> 01:12:12.960
a leader that's far away from you and the chain of command.

903
01:12:13.770 --> 01:12:14.610
Yeah.
Yeah.

904
01:12:17.600 --> 01:12:20.700
You've got to build a relationship with that person.
That's what you gotta do.

905
01:12:22.050 --> 01:12:22.950
In fact,

906
01:12:24.390 --> 01:12:27.180
leadership is about building trust and building relationships with people and

907
01:12:27.240 --> 01:12:31.230
trust his leadership and leadership is trust and relationships or trust and

908
01:12:31.231 --> 01:12:33.490
relationships or leadership.
These are like the,

909
01:12:33.940 --> 01:12:37.770
the Trifecta of becoming a good leader.
You build trust with people,

910
01:12:37.771 --> 01:12:42.720
you build relationships.
And in a situation like this,
if I have no,

911
01:12:42.750 --> 01:12:46.470
if you and I don't know each other very well and I come up to you and say,
Hey,

912
01:12:46.471 --> 01:12:49.340
I think you should do this.
I mean,
what's your reaction?
Right?

913
01:12:49.400 --> 01:12:52.200
If you just approach someone that you don't have a relationship with and then

914
01:12:52.201 --> 01:12:55.530
you start telling them how to run things that that's offensive,

915
01:12:55.590 --> 01:12:59.940
that's offensive to like most human beings.
I have to,

916
01:13:00.540 --> 01:13:01.560
I have to get to know you.

917
01:13:01.620 --> 01:13:03.900
I have to see what kind of approach is going to work for you,

918
01:13:04.590 --> 01:13:05.670
cause you might be the kind of person,

919
01:13:05.671 --> 01:13:07.190
if I know you a little bit where you're like,
you know what?

920
01:13:07.191 --> 01:13:09.690
I'm really working on my leadership.
What do you think I could do better?

921
01:13:09.691 --> 01:13:11.910
That's great.
Then we opened the door and we can move forward.

922
01:13:12.060 --> 01:13:13.830
You might be the kind of person that I have to flank.

923
01:13:14.550 --> 01:13:18.990
You might be the kind of person that you won't listen to me,

924
01:13:19.050 --> 01:13:22.410
but I say,
oh,
you should check out this book that I read or whatever.

925
01:13:22.411 --> 01:13:26.160
There's ways to do it,
but to look at a target

926
01:13:27.720 --> 01:13:31.260
and know how you're going to attack the target without knowing anything about
it,

927
01:13:31.261 --> 01:13:34.560
without having an any,
any intelligence on it,
that's not going to be effective.

928
01:13:35.220 --> 01:13:39.780
So we have to actually gather some intelligence about the target we have to and

929
01:13:39.781 --> 01:13:41.520
the way we do that is by building a relationship with,

930
01:13:41.940 --> 01:13:45.030
by getting to know that person.
Once you know the person,

931
01:13:45.060 --> 01:13:50.060
then you can start to infuse and shift and mold and sculpt and influence the way

932
01:13:53.581 --> 01:13:56.370
that they lead.
You have to build that relationship.

933
01:13:58.320 --> 01:14:02.760
<v 3>To kick things off,
next question,</v>

934
01:14:03.270 --> 01:14:06.840
I'm not in the military nor am I a firefighter or law enforcement.

935
01:14:07.440 --> 01:14:12.370
I'm an air traffic controller here in the New York area and I found myself in

936
01:14:12.371 --> 01:14:15.730
several leadership positions without within our union,

937
01:14:17.130 --> 01:14:18.540
since I read extreme ownership,

938
01:14:18.541 --> 01:14:22.140
I've tried to implement this and the ideals that come with it.

939
01:14:22.170 --> 01:14:27.000
Overall I believe it's been a success and of course still a work in progress.

940
01:14:27.120 --> 01:14:31.560
Specifically the communication aspect of ensuring our people,
no,

941
01:14:31.561 --> 01:14:32.430
why are we doing,

942
01:14:32.880 --> 01:14:37.260
why are we are doing something and how it affects them as it's has been the

943
01:14:37.261 --> 01:14:39.690
biggest influence and game changer in my opinion.

944
01:14:40.170 --> 01:14:43.470
Unions typically come hand in hand with what about me,

945
01:14:43.471 --> 01:14:48.471
attitudes and we definitely have that within our ranks.

946
01:14:49.110 --> 01:14:53.160
This is something I've been trying to tackle with both new air controllers,

947
01:14:53.400 --> 01:14:57.450
new controllers and older ones.
And I think I'm making headway slowly but surely.

948
01:14:58.050 --> 01:15:01.260
Thanks.
See you in life.
My question is this,

949
01:15:01.320 --> 01:15:05.670
have you ever had direct experience dealing with unions and this particular

950
01:15:05.671 --> 01:15:06.510
mindset?

951
01:15:06.750 --> 01:15:10.380
Is there any advice that you can have you have specific to labor unions that

952
01:15:10.381 --> 01:15:13.230
could make this more effective or efficient?

953
01:15:13.490 --> 01:15:13.970
<v 2>Yeah,
we,</v>

954
01:15:13.970 --> 01:15:17.900
well we work with businesses all the time and we certainly work with businesses

955
01:15:17.901 --> 01:15:22.901
that are involved with or that that either are unionized or partially unionized.

956
01:15:23.450 --> 01:15:26.630
And yeah,
this is something that can be very,
very common.

957
01:15:26.960 --> 01:15:31.670
And the reason that can become very,
very common is because the union

958
01:15:33.370 --> 01:15:38.360
is,
is an organization,
right?
And the company,
the,

959
01:15:38.420 --> 01:15:39.430
the corporate,

960
01:15:40.550 --> 01:15:44.540
the headquarters is a separate organization.

961
01:15:44.990 --> 01:15:49.990
And so what happens is as we let these two elements grow,

962
01:15:50.700 --> 01:15:50.930
they,

963
01:15:50.930 --> 01:15:55.930
they tend to grow apart and they tend to start looking out for themselves.

964
01:15:56.360 --> 01:15:58.490
And that becomes problematic.

965
01:15:59.030 --> 01:16:02.030
It becomes problematic in any organization where you've got the union on one

966
01:16:02.031 --> 01:16:06.950
side.
And what the union starts looking out for is what's good for them and what

967
01:16:06.951 --> 01:16:09.530
corporate is looking out for,
what headquarters,
looking out for us,

968
01:16:09.531 --> 01:16:10.670
what's good for them.

969
01:16:11.300 --> 01:16:14.300
And what happens is we stopped talking to each other and we,

970
01:16:14.330 --> 01:16:19.330
and what we failed to realize is that both those entities have a common goal.

971
01:16:23.270 --> 01:16:25.640
They have a common goal.
And the,

972
01:16:25.790 --> 01:16:30.790
the more we work together to achieve that common goal,

973
01:16:31.550 --> 01:16:35.690
the better off both entities will be.

974
01:16:36.380 --> 01:16:39.110
So what this boils down to,

975
01:16:39.111 --> 01:16:43.340
and the where I would focus step number one in this,
this is a long fight.

976
01:16:43.341 --> 01:16:48.341
This is a long war is trying to make sure that the union side,

977
01:16:49.300 --> 01:16:52.340
cause you're,
you're talking about from your position in the Union,

978
01:16:52.430 --> 01:16:57.430
the union side understands how working with corporate headquarters,

979
01:17:00.740 --> 01:17:05.740
how working with them will benefit the individuals in the union in the long run.

980
01:17:07.220 --> 01:17:07.491
So,

981
01:17:07.491 --> 01:17:11.300
and that a great book to read about this is that book I mentioned earlier with

982
01:17:11.301 --> 01:17:15.110
Malali,
uh,
American icon and,
and what he,
you know,

983
01:17:15.111 --> 01:17:18.200
what he told the unions was,
hey listen,
I get it.

984
01:17:18.230 --> 01:17:22.700
You want your hourly wage to be $76 an hour.

985
01:17:23.210 --> 01:17:25.730
You want to take care of the union?
That's awesome.

986
01:17:26.330 --> 01:17:30.680
Let me tell you what's going to happen in 18 months if we keep paying that we're

987
01:17:30.681 --> 01:17:33.590
not going to have a company anymore.
Here's the numbers,

988
01:17:33.620 --> 01:17:34.760
here's how it's going to work.

989
01:17:35.120 --> 01:17:39.710
And they lowered down their hourly rate to $55 an hour.

990
01:17:39.920 --> 01:17:41.030
That's a huge cut.

991
01:17:41.420 --> 01:17:45.260
And you can imagine the union thinking that's we lost,

992
01:17:45.500 --> 01:17:49.760
we lost.
But Malali did a great job of saying,

993
01:17:49.761 --> 01:17:53.030
no,
we lose.
If we don't come together,

994
01:17:53.240 --> 01:17:57.530
we lose if we don't try and achieve our actual mission,

995
01:17:57.590 --> 01:17:59.420
the mission that we're all focused on,

996
01:18:00.080 --> 01:18:03.680
which is making great cars and being a profitable company.

997
01:18:05.120 --> 01:18:07.010
So same thing here.

998
01:18:07.310 --> 01:18:11.510
Make sure that the areas that overlap the common mission,

999
01:18:11.540 --> 01:18:16.540
make sure that everyone understands how achieving the common mission benefits

1000
01:18:16.641 --> 01:18:18.230
both parties.

1001
01:18:21.360 --> 01:18:24.850
<v 4>Makes Sense.
Next question.</v>

1002
01:18:27.910 --> 01:18:28.990
<v 2>I've been a police officer.</v>

1003
01:18:28.991 --> 01:18:31.630
If you guys wrote some long questions for Echo Charles Reed,

1004
01:18:33.970 --> 01:18:35.590
he's been studying them for four hours.

1005
01:18:38.110 --> 01:18:39.490
I've been a police officer

1006
01:18:39.610 --> 01:18:40.780
<v 3>for about four years.</v>

1007
01:18:40.810 --> 01:18:45.220
I consider myself to be proactive and try to get after it every day.

1008
01:18:45.250 --> 01:18:49.960
Much like many of my brother and sister law enforcement officers recently I

1009
01:18:49.961 --> 01:18:53.500
switched to a bigger agency with a,
with a bit of a different mission.

1010
01:18:53.770 --> 01:18:58.770
I still try to be as proactive and as thorough as I can in everything that I do,

1011
01:19:00.160 --> 01:19:04.630
but I've noticed that many of the frontline supervisors in this agency want

1012
01:19:04.631 --> 01:19:07.840
officers to be reactive rather than proactive.

1013
01:19:08.320 --> 01:19:13.300
The supervisor in particular has told me to stop working so hard and get salty

1014
01:19:16.460 --> 01:19:19.160
suggesting that I lower my morale.

1015
01:19:19.880 --> 01:19:23.900
The question is how do I build a relationship with these supervisors while still

1016
01:19:23.901 --> 01:19:25.910
being proactive and working hard?

1017
01:19:27.160 --> 01:19:32.160
<v 2>So this is what I did when I got to seal team one,</v>

1018
01:19:33.910 --> 01:19:37.840
I was this guy right here.
I was fired up.

1019
01:19:39.610 --> 01:19:43.510
I was,
hey,
oh,
we're doing an obstacle course today.
Cool.

1020
01:19:43.540 --> 01:19:46.630
I'm going to wear my ruck sack with a 40 pound sandbag in it.

1021
01:19:47.290 --> 01:19:50.770
And all the guys that were older were,
you know,
looking at me like,
dude,

1022
01:19:51.100 --> 01:19:52.480
pump brakes

1023
01:19:55.450 --> 01:19:57.670
and you know,
of course,

1024
01:19:57.671 --> 01:20:00.640
what did I think those cards are hardcore core.

1025
01:20:01.030 --> 01:20:04.120
Those guys are weak.
That's what I was thinking.

1026
01:20:05.050 --> 01:20:10.050
And then,
you know,
I thought to myself,
how can I,

1027
01:20:10.710 --> 01:20:12.150
how can I have influence over them?

1028
01:20:13.440 --> 01:20:15.450
How can I have influence over the platoon that I'm in?

1029
01:20:16.200 --> 01:20:19.050
Can I have influence over the platoon that I'm in?

1030
01:20:19.320 --> 01:20:22.890
If everyone that's in my platoon doesn't like me?

1031
01:20:25.430 --> 01:20:27.030
No.
Can you,

1032
01:20:27.480 --> 01:20:32.480
if everyone in my platoon doesn't like me because I'm super hardcore,

1033
01:20:34.140 --> 01:20:38.460
then are they going to steer it all in my direction?
No.

1034
01:20:38.520 --> 01:20:42.330
The answer's no.
The answer's no.
In fact,

1035
01:20:42.660 --> 01:20:44.280
they're going to isolate me.
In fact,

1036
01:20:44.281 --> 01:20:47.730
I'm going to have no influence over my platoon and that's a,

1037
01:20:47.731 --> 01:20:52.670
that's a horrible thing.
So what did I do?
Did I just go,
okay,
cool.

1038
01:20:52.700 --> 01:20:56.850
It looks like donuts is the deal.
No,
I didn't do that at all.

1039
01:20:57.720 --> 01:21:01.500
But I conformed,

1040
01:21:03.060 --> 01:21:07.680
I conform and people think,
oh,
that's weak.

1041
01:21:07.740 --> 01:21:11.520
You shouldn't conform.
Look,
you are not the priority.

1042
01:21:12.960 --> 01:21:17.700
You as an individual are not the priority in a seal platoon,

1043
01:21:18.540 --> 01:21:19.590
you're not.

1044
01:21:20.040 --> 01:21:23.640
The priority is the platoon.

1045
01:21:23.700 --> 01:21:28.700
The priority is the mission and if we're going to execute a mission,

1046
01:21:29.340 --> 01:21:32.370
we need to be very tight as a team.

1047
01:21:32.700 --> 01:21:37.700
So if I put my personality above the unity of the team,

1048
01:21:38.190 --> 01:21:42.510
I'm hurting our capability of accomplishing the mission,

1049
01:21:42.830 --> 01:21:47.190
especially if I realize that guys need to train a little bit harder and instead

1050
01:21:47.191 --> 01:21:51.390
of actually doing something that's going to move them in that direction,

1051
01:21:51.450 --> 01:21:55.750
they reject me and now I'm outside the,

1052
01:21:55.780 --> 01:21:57.660
the Brotherhood,
the circle,

1053
01:21:58.260 --> 01:22:00.780
and now I haven't moved them into the right direction at all.

1054
01:22:00.780 --> 01:22:02.250
So now there's one guy that's in really good shape,

1055
01:22:02.251 --> 01:22:07.251
me and everyone else is going in the other direction and I have no influence

1056
01:22:08.371 --> 01:22:11.490
over them that that's just terrible.

1057
01:22:13.230 --> 01:22:15.330
The mission is the most important thing.

1058
01:22:16.140 --> 01:22:18.570
In order to most effectively execute the mission,

1059
01:22:18.810 --> 01:22:23.400
we have to have the best possible team in order to have the best possible team.

1060
01:22:23.490 --> 01:22:26.760
We have to have trust and relationships inside the team.

1061
01:22:27.480 --> 01:22:31.740
If I
violate that,

1062
01:22:32.730 --> 01:22:37.230
I'm taking away from the team.
I'm taking away from our mission capability.
Now,

1063
01:22:37.290 --> 01:22:37.951
of course,

1064
01:22:37.951 --> 01:22:42.480
if there's someone that's gold closely out of shape or out of standards,

1065
01:22:42.570 --> 01:22:46.800
yeah,
I'm gonna,
I'm gonna try and tighten that person up.
But again,

1066
01:22:47.520 --> 01:22:51.180
if someone's completely out of standards and all I do is attack them,

1067
01:22:51.181 --> 01:22:55.650
what's their reaction?
It's to,
to step away from you to reject me.
But if I,

1068
01:22:56.010 --> 01:23:00.060
if I say,
hey man,
you know,
I know you've got a lot of experience and you know,

1069
01:23:00.061 --> 01:23:04.050
I'm,
I'm 19 and I just got a bud,
so I'm in pretty good shape,
but like,

1070
01:23:05.160 --> 01:23:08.140
can,
can you teach me some of the tactics that,
you know,

1071
01:23:08.290 --> 01:23:12.820
and all of a sudden I'm building a relationship with them
and then I say,

1072
01:23:12.850 --> 01:23:17.530
Hey,
do you want to go for a little,
a little John with me after work?

1073
01:23:18.040 --> 01:23:21.160
And you know,
that guy's done eight deployments and he's tired and he's old,

1074
01:23:21.161 --> 01:23:24.880
but he wants to be back in shape because we all want to be in shape.
And he goes,

1075
01:23:26.680 --> 01:23:28.030
okay,
a short one

1076
01:23:30.370 --> 01:23:35.020
and we're moving in the right direction.
So that's what you need to do.

1077
01:23:35.050 --> 01:23:37.810
You have to,
you have to back off a little bit.

1078
01:23:38.230 --> 01:23:43.230
You have to find balance and you have to focus on the team and it's better to

1079
01:23:44.501 --> 01:23:46.000
have the whole team.

1080
01:23:46.030 --> 01:23:50.740
It's better to have 20 people that move a little bit in the right direction.

1081
01:23:51.610 --> 01:23:54.310
Then have one person by themselves that's going in the right direction and

1082
01:23:54.311 --> 01:23:55.570
everyone else is going in the wrong direction.

1083
01:23:56.740 --> 01:23:59.350
So that's what you need to do.

1084
01:23:59.980 --> 01:24:03.760
Take the sand bag out of your rucksack a little bit.
And you know,

1085
01:24:03.761 --> 01:24:05.370
I ran with jungle boots on,

1086
01:24:05.371 --> 01:24:10.180
I did all this stuff and it didn't take me very long to realize I was not doing

1087
01:24:10.181 --> 01:24:12.610
the right thing,
not making my team stronger.

1088
01:24:13.030 --> 01:24:15.430
I was isolating myself and stopped it.

1089
01:24:17.210 --> 01:24:19.880
<v 3>So this guy,
he should like what?</v>

1090
01:24:19.881 --> 01:24:22.220
Start acting just a little bit salty

1091
01:24:23.980 --> 01:24:26.420
or you know,
or you know,

1092
01:24:26.690 --> 01:24:31.690
lower his morale appearance a little bit to kind of fit in so to speak.

1093
01:24:32.571 --> 01:24:33.560
Yeah.
Do

1094
01:24:33.850 --> 01:24:38.290
<v 2>you want to be part of the team?
If you're not part of the team,</v>

1095
01:24:38.320 --> 01:24:41.440
you don't have any influence.
If you don't have any influence,

1096
01:24:41.441 --> 01:24:43.810
you can't move the team in the right direction.

1097
01:24:44.230 --> 01:24:45.850
If you can't move the team in the right direction,

1098
01:24:46.120 --> 01:24:48.160
the team is less mission capable.

1099
01:24:48.400 --> 01:24:52.900
That's what you're there for is to make the team more mission capable.

1100
01:24:53.140 --> 01:24:57.220
Every moment that you don't do that,
you're,
you're doing something wrong.

1101
01:24:59.140 --> 01:25:02.680
So yes,
you don't have to show up.
I mean,

1102
01:25:02.681 --> 01:25:05.800
just imagine I was a new guy at seal team one people we show up to run the,

1103
01:25:05.801 --> 01:25:06.730
of course the o courses,

1104
01:25:07.060 --> 01:25:12.060
obstacle courses are really hard obstacle course and I show up with a rucksack

1105
01:25:12.340 --> 01:25:16.720
on with a 40 pound sand bagging it as a new guy.
Yeah.
You know,

1106
01:25:16.721 --> 01:25:20.930
of course cop people like God's fired up,
but people were like,
okay,

1107
01:25:24.520 --> 01:25:28.600
oh you're,
oh you're,
you're 19 years old and you just got out of buds.

1108
01:25:29.400 --> 01:25:32.050
Whatever makes sense,
we don't like you.

1109
01:25:34.090 --> 01:25:34.923
So

1110
01:25:37.450 --> 01:25:40.290
<v 3>it's kind of like steering like a big Van,
right?</v>

1111
01:25:40.291 --> 01:25:42.960
You can't just start making big turns with a big otherwise.

1112
01:25:43.020 --> 01:25:47.220
That thing's gonna tip over a little bit.
See what I'm saying?
No,

1113
01:25:47.221 --> 01:25:52.140
you gotta like you can't,
you gotta you gotta go slow.
Is what I'm saying.

1114
01:25:52.700 --> 01:25:56.850
Okay.
You guys understand.
Anyway,

1115
01:25:56.851 --> 01:25:58.590
next question.
Sure.

1116
01:26:05.120 --> 01:26:08.330
<v 4>Apparently,
apparently the bad thing was it.
Yeah,
it was correct.</v>

1117
01:26:08.331 --> 01:26:11.430
That's what some of you that didn't understand it until we understood it,

1118
01:26:12.350 --> 01:26:13.910
correct?
Yes,
exactly.

1119
01:26:14.230 --> 01:26:16.330
<v 3>Big outstanding.
Anyway,</v>

1120
01:26:16.450 --> 01:26:20.740
my wife and I have four young boys ages between ages three and seven.

1121
01:26:20.800 --> 01:26:23.470
We're both running successful,
busy careers.

1122
01:26:23.500 --> 01:26:28.120
My question is how do you forge a meaningful connected relationship that

1123
01:26:28.121 --> 01:26:32.050
instills discipline and leadership with your kids while balancing today's

1124
01:26:32.320 --> 01:26:35.410
demanding 24 seven corporate environment?

1125
01:26:37.050 --> 01:26:40.890
<v 2>Here's a couple things.
Make time.
You have to make time.</v>

1126
01:26:42.180 --> 01:26:45.300
You have to make time where you're not looking at your phone,

1127
01:26:45.360 --> 01:26:46.440
you're not looking at your emails.

1128
01:26:46.560 --> 01:26:51.270
You have to set a good example and I think the most important thing here for

1129
01:26:51.271 --> 01:26:52.620
kids age three to seven,

1130
01:26:52.950 --> 01:26:57.950
you have to make sure that they understand that what you're doing,

1131
01:26:58.560 --> 01:27:02.880
what you're doing and why you're doing it.
They have to understand,
look,
you know,

1132
01:27:02.881 --> 01:27:06.750
this house we live in,
we have to pay money for this house that we live in.

1133
01:27:06.810 --> 01:27:09.030
You know,
the food that we eat,
we have to pay money for that.

1134
01:27:09.600 --> 01:27:13.890
And in order for us to have a secure future where we can still have a house and

1135
01:27:13.891 --> 01:27:18.420
we can still have food,
we need to make sure that we have money for the future.

1136
01:27:18.600 --> 01:27:20.970
That's why mom and dad works so hard.

1137
01:27:21.330 --> 01:27:25.590
It doesn't mean that we wouldn't love to sit around and play with you guys all

1138
01:27:25.590 --> 01:27:28.710
day.
We would love to do that in every chance we get.
We're going to do it.

1139
01:27:29.070 --> 01:27:33.120
But we have to be able to pay for the things we have and we have to be able to

1140
01:27:33.121 --> 01:27:34.080
pay for our future.

1141
01:27:34.530 --> 01:27:38.790
And that's why we're working so hard right now so we can have more freedom and

1142
01:27:38.791 --> 01:27:40.020
more time with you in the future.

1143
01:27:40.110 --> 01:27:44.070
So they have to understand why you're doing what you're doing.

1144
01:27:44.250 --> 01:27:48.200
And I'll add this.
So do you,

1145
01:27:49.820 --> 01:27:50.840
so do you.

1146
01:27:52.130 --> 01:27:57.130
You have to assess why you are working so much that you're taking time away from

1147
01:27:59.391 --> 01:28:04.391
your family if you're working so much and taking time away from your family so

1148
01:28:05.241 --> 01:28:10.241
that you can get the Mercedes s class instead of the Lexus.

1149
01:28:13.790 --> 01:28:14.720
Ask Yourself,

1150
01:28:15.740 --> 01:28:18.980
is that why you're doing it and what has more value?

1151
01:28:19.730 --> 01:28:23.420
The s class
or the dance recital,

1152
01:28:25.970 --> 01:28:27.140
keep yourself in check.

1153
01:28:29.560 --> 01:28:30.940
<v 3>Yeah,
it makes sense to Annie.</v>

1154
01:28:30.941 --> 01:28:34.560
You kinda gotta tell the truth to yourself cause ina hall,

1155
01:28:34.570 --> 01:28:38.140
like you could answer the email later or at another time,

1156
01:28:38.500 --> 01:28:42.790
not dinnertime or whatever.
You know,
he kind of got to be truthful.

1157
01:28:43.090 --> 01:28:44.740
That's what I've found anyway.
Helps.

1158
01:28:45.530 --> 01:28:50.060
<v 2>That's why you don't return my emails on time.
Next question.</v>

1159
01:28:53.010 --> 01:28:57.480
<v 3>Was there a time during your service in the teams that stood out above the rest</v>

1160
01:28:57.510 --> 01:29:01.350
and would you mind sharing a brief story not before heard on your podcasts?

1161
01:29:02.640 --> 01:29:02.841
<v 2>Well,</v>

1162
01:29:02.841 --> 01:29:06.030
obviously the time and the teams was being in tasking at bruiser of been in the

1163
01:29:06.031 --> 01:29:08.350
battle of Ramadi.
That's pretty straight forward.

1164
01:29:09.540 --> 01:29:13.050
Something that I haven't,

1165
01:29:13.260 --> 01:29:17.520
I don't think I've talked about on the podcast,
but it,

1166
01:29:18.840 --> 01:29:22.530
it definitely is something that I remember very clearly.

1167
01:29:23.220 --> 01:29:25.340
And that is when,

1168
01:29:26.040 --> 01:29:29.910
when seal team five came in to take over for us.

1169
01:29:30.360 --> 01:29:35.360
And so this was in October of 2006 and seal team five a task unit from seal team

1170
01:29:37.291 --> 01:29:42.240
five came in to take over for us and we're doing the turnover with them,

1171
01:29:42.241 --> 01:29:47.241
meaning we're explaining to them the battle space and it takes a couple days for

1172
01:29:49.291 --> 01:29:50.550
all of them to arrive.

1173
01:29:50.610 --> 01:29:54.360
They arrive in bits and pieces and so we're doing the turnover.

1174
01:29:55.680 --> 01:29:58.350
But once they were all there,

1175
01:30:00.440 --> 01:30:05.420
I did a turnover brief with them,
the whole group.

1176
01:30:05.900 --> 01:30:07.280
And as a matter of fact,

1177
01:30:07.281 --> 01:30:12.281
Marcus Luttrell was in this group and this was after he had gone through what

1178
01:30:14.841 --> 01:30:16.730
he'd gone through enough.
You know,

1179
01:30:16.790 --> 01:30:19.370
I just saw Marcus the other day and we were talking about this,

1180
01:30:19.460 --> 01:30:23.900
I couldn't believe he was in Ramadi after what he went through.

1181
01:30:23.901 --> 01:30:26.930
And this was not long after there.

1182
01:30:26.931 --> 01:30:31.931
He was in Ramadi as a platoon leading petty officer and

1183
01:30:33.750 --> 01:30:37.620
it was his group of guys.
And I remember one thing I just,

1184
01:30:37.650 --> 01:30:42.650
I just remember was looking at them and I was telling them,

1185
01:30:43.980 --> 01:30:44.530
<v 0>yeah,</v>

1186
01:30:44.530 --> 01:30:47.290
<v 2>you are going to take casualties.</v>

1187
01:30:48.420 --> 01:30:49.070
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1188
01:30:49.070 --> 01:30:50.000
<v 2>And</v>

1189
01:30:52.040 --> 01:30:57.040
that it's sort of like that thing you see in the movies or I've talked about it,

1190
01:30:57.681 --> 01:31:01.790
read it in books about Vietnam where you had guys that were coming in country

1191
01:31:02.480 --> 01:31:07.480
and they got new camouflage uniforms on and they're all clean cut and there's

1192
01:31:08.180 --> 01:31:13.180
the guys that are getting ready to go home and those guys at that time seals

1193
01:31:17.420 --> 01:31:21.260
deploying into a situation you seals deployment situations.

1194
01:31:21.261 --> 01:31:24.830
They're kind of unknown.
At least up until this point,
it was like,
okay,

1195
01:31:24.831 --> 01:31:26.420
well we're going,
we're going to do missions.

1196
01:31:26.421 --> 01:31:29.240
We don't know how bad it's going to be.
It might be bad,
it might not be.

1197
01:31:29.241 --> 01:31:30.680
That sort of was the standard.

1198
01:31:31.220 --> 01:31:33.800
Those guys that were coming into Ramadi that relieved us,
Ramadi,

1199
01:31:34.100 --> 01:31:37.970
they knew and the senior enlisted guys are one of my very good friends.

1200
01:31:38.900 --> 01:31:42.980
Those guys knew 100% they went to Mike [inaudible] funeral and then got on a

1201
01:31:42.981 --> 01:31:43.581
plane and came over.

1202
01:31:43.581 --> 01:31:47.990
They knew 100% and so for me,

1203
01:31:47.991 --> 01:31:52.010
I won't forget looking at this group of guys that were about to start a six

1204
01:31:52.011 --> 01:31:57.011
month deployment and telling them you are going to take casualties.

1205
01:31:59.170 --> 01:32:02.230
And that was just a blunt,
honest truth and

1206
01:32:02.810 --> 01:32:03.643
<v 0>okay,</v>

1207
01:32:03.830 --> 01:32:06.650
<v 2>they did take casualties.
They didn't lose anyone.
They had no one killed,</v>

1208
01:32:06.651 --> 01:32:07.880
but they took some very,

1209
01:32:07.881 --> 01:32:12.050
very severe casualties and did a great job.

1210
01:32:12.080 --> 01:32:16.310
Great Group of guys.
But that was a harsh reality to walk into for sure.

1211
01:32:20.750 --> 01:32:21.000
All right,

1212
01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:25.650
we'll do one more of these questions before the life question and then we'll go

1213
01:32:25.651 --> 01:32:26.460
live

1214
01:32:26.460 --> 01:32:27.293
<v 0>people.</v>

1215
01:32:30.750 --> 01:32:34.560
<v 2>What was your first combat mission and what was your role?</v>

1216
01:32:36.880 --> 01:32:37.720
<v 0>So</v>

1217
01:32:38.140 --> 01:32:43.140
<v 2>2003 I deployed to Baghdad as a seal platoon commander and the senior enlisted</v>

1218
01:32:47.321 --> 01:32:52.321
guy of my task unit was already in Baghdad waiting for us.

1219
01:32:53.500 --> 01:32:58.120
And this guy is an incredible guy.
Just uh,

1220
01:32:58.870 --> 01:32:59.531
as a matter of fact,

1221
01:32:59.531 --> 01:33:04.360
his wife tells him and me that were soul mates.

1222
01:33:06.070 --> 01:33:10.870
She's jealous.
But anyways,
this guy,
just an incredible guy,

1223
01:33:11.410 --> 01:33:16.410
but he had been on the ground for a while and he'd done the push up into Baghdad

1224
01:33:17.110 --> 01:33:21.430
with the marines and then he'd come home and then he was back over.

1225
01:33:21.431 --> 01:33:24.430
And so he was waiting for us and he was,
it was my platoon.

1226
01:33:24.431 --> 01:33:27.280
We show up and I remember we hit the ground.

1227
01:33:27.520 --> 01:33:29.890
I don't even know how long we'd been there,
but it wasn't long.
It was,

1228
01:33:29.891 --> 01:33:34.891
it might've been like the night we got there and there was mortar teams that

1229
01:33:37.031 --> 01:33:42.031
were more during our base and they had been for a few days.

1230
01:33:43.930 --> 01:33:45.760
And so this guy,

1231
01:33:47.890 --> 01:33:52.600
a couple of mortars went,
I think anyways,
whatever happened,

1232
01:33:52.660 --> 01:33:54.970
he comes in like,
you're taking your guys out right now.

1233
01:33:55.030 --> 01:33:58.600
You got to take your guys out and go and see if you can find where these things

1234
01:33:58.601 --> 01:34:01.750
launched from.
And I was,

1235
01:34:04.920 --> 01:34:09.750
I was sort of not ready for that.
You know,
we'd been there for four hours,

1236
01:34:09.990 --> 01:34:11.980
but you're taking your guys out and um,
uh,

1237
01:34:12.210 --> 01:34:16.270
you know what I said Roger that and you know,

1238
01:34:16.290 --> 01:34:19.480
I talked to him later,
like later that night.
And he goes,
yeah,

1239
01:34:19.481 --> 01:34:22.500
I was just trying to get you outside the wire and get some.
And I was like,

1240
01:34:22.560 --> 01:34:25.740
how about you give me a heads up next time?
So that was it.

1241
01:34:25.800 --> 01:34:29.430
I was just running that little vehicle thing and we went out and look for bad

1242
01:34:29.431 --> 01:34:31.140
guys.
We didn't find any and came home,

1243
01:34:31.170 --> 01:34:35.460
but that was the first kind of exposure outside the wire in Baghdad.

1244
01:34:35.490 --> 01:34:40.220
Not a very exciting story.
Sorry.
There we go.

1245
01:34:40.810 --> 01:34:41.960
All right.
Um,

1246
01:34:42.030 --> 01:34:47.030
so we got some folks running around with microphones and does anyone have a,

1247
01:34:48.150 --> 01:34:52.200
does anyone have any questions?
Okay,
let's see a couple of hands anyways,

1248
01:34:52.470 --> 01:34:56.250
I'm going to take this thing off so I can sort of move around and see you and

1249
01:34:56.580 --> 01:34:58.070
our Mike People.
I'll point

1250
01:34:58.070 --> 01:35:01.670
<v 5>to you and we'll find somebody.
All right,
let's go.
You right there.</v>

1251
01:35:01.671 --> 01:35:02.570
Black sweatshirt.

1252
01:35:03.530 --> 01:35:05.600
<v 6>I just,
I was just trying to get him to call and me,</v>

1253
01:35:05.601 --> 01:35:09.830
but he wouldn't wait until he took your order.
So you got a good team here.

1254
01:35:11.450 --> 01:35:14.660
So you were talking about childbearing before,

1255
01:35:15.860 --> 01:35:20.810
so not me personally,
but no,
you had to,
you were cornered.
Um,

1256
01:35:20.990 --> 01:35:24.860
any thoughts about having a child rearing book come out?

1257
01:35:25.160 --> 01:35:29.870
Like a team childbearing book you've been how to raise kids?

1258
01:35:30.170 --> 01:35:34.100
Well,
yeah.
Childbearing.
Yeah.

1259
01:35:35.150 --> 01:35:39.320
Um,
I mean maybe not.
Maybe this is a bad thing.

1260
01:35:39.370 --> 01:35:42.820
<v 5>Yeah,
no,
no,
no.
I'll tell you what.
I wrote a couple books.</v>

1261
01:35:42.860 --> 01:35:46.600
One is called way of the warrior kid and one one's called Mark Mark's mission.

1262
01:35:46.660 --> 01:35:48.980
I read them.
Okay.
Yeah.
I mean the,

1263
01:35:49.960 --> 01:35:54.960
the amount of people that have come back to me and said like as a dad,

1264
01:35:55.240 --> 01:35:59.740
as a mom,
yeah.
Thank you for writing this book because every time I read it,

1265
01:35:59.770 --> 01:36:00.520
I learned.

1266
01:36:00.520 --> 01:36:04.990
Now that means that I'm basically saying,

1267
01:36:04.991 --> 01:36:09.490
hey,
you need to learn.
You need to pull parse the lessons Outta here.

1268
01:36:10.060 --> 01:36:15.060
So perhaps I could be making more straightforward and also,

1269
01:36:16.840 --> 01:36:20.020
hey,
as I'm the perfect parent by any stretch,
right.

1270
01:36:20.440 --> 01:36:24.310
But one thing that's good about putting ideas on paper is I would start to

1271
01:36:24.311 --> 01:36:27.030
clarify things myself and you start looking at,

1272
01:36:27.040 --> 01:36:30.010
I would start looking at mistakes that I made and say,
okay,

1273
01:36:30.070 --> 01:36:32.500
here's a clear mistake.
I didn't really recognize it before,

1274
01:36:32.501 --> 01:36:37.000
but now that I'm detached,
I'm looking back at it.
So yeah,
not a bad idea.

1275
01:36:37.110 --> 01:36:40.800
<v 6>Yep.
Finances,
everything.
Just how to discuss with your kids.</v>

1276
01:36:40.801 --> 01:36:44.370
Like all of these things are really important topics and I think the extreme

1277
01:36:44.371 --> 01:36:47.340
ownership perspective could be a great addition.

1278
01:36:47.720 --> 01:36:50.670
<v 5>Awesome.
Thank you.
I'll buy it.</v>

1279
01:36:51.890 --> 01:36:56.180
Quick question over here.
You,
um,

1280
01:36:56.660 --> 01:37:01.650
he's leaving it.
I like to come prepared.
Uh,
good evening Jocko.

1281
01:37:02.210 --> 01:37:03.043
Good evening.

1282
01:37:07.170 --> 01:37:12.170
<v 6>What lesson do you wish you would have learned earlier in life that you now</v>

1283
01:37:12.900 --> 01:37:13.733
know?

1284
01:37:17.420 --> 01:37:20.300
<v 5>It is discipline equals freedom.
I mean,
that is the thing that,</v>

1285
01:37:20.301 --> 01:37:24.750
that when I connected that together in my head,
that,

1286
01:37:24.800 --> 01:37:27.680
that the fact that that applies to absolutely everything.

1287
01:37:28.700 --> 01:37:32.780
That's the biggest lesson that I wish I would have learned earlier in life.

1288
01:37:34.070 --> 01:37:35.990
And if I would have figured that out,

1289
01:37:36.080 --> 01:37:40.750
then I would've been doing a lot better and I would've done a lot better.

1290
01:37:40.760 --> 01:37:42.290
I would have been a lot better of a person.

1291
01:37:42.950 --> 01:37:47.570
The thing that I try to tell kids,
I try and tell him that for sure.

1292
01:37:47.990 --> 01:37:52.610
But the other thing that I think kids miss his kids,

1293
01:37:52.910 --> 01:37:55.320
and this is something that I completely missed as a kid,

1294
01:37:55.800 --> 01:37:59.550
the actions that you take now affect your future.

1295
01:37:59.760 --> 01:38:01.590
That sounds so obvious.

1296
01:38:01.860 --> 01:38:06.180
But when you're 14 you just think no,
nothing.
I,
you know,

1297
01:38:06.270 --> 01:38:10.500
my life is only another 20 minutes.
So what I'm doing right now,

1298
01:38:10.501 --> 01:38:13.260
it doesn't really matter.
So when I talk to kids,

1299
01:38:13.261 --> 01:38:15.330
I try and explain to them that discipline equals freedom.

1300
01:38:15.510 --> 01:38:20.510
And then I tried to explain to them that what you're doing right now really will

1301
01:38:20.790 --> 01:38:23.430
have an impact to where you are in the future.

1302
01:38:23.580 --> 01:38:26.710
And I don't know if you listened to that podcast that I do,

1303
01:38:26.760 --> 01:38:31.760
the warrior kid podcast that I did number 19 about my friend Jeff and

1304
01:38:33.840 --> 01:38:36.720
I talked about it on the adult podcasts as well.
But you know,

1305
01:38:36.721 --> 01:38:37.830
it's a classic story.

1306
01:38:37.831 --> 01:38:42.831
I had a best friend when I was little and we separated friendship,

1307
01:38:43.291 --> 01:38:46.380
not,
we were still friends,
but we,
we drifted apart.

1308
01:38:46.440 --> 01:38:49.200
He started getting into partying and getting into drugs and all that and I

1309
01:38:49.201 --> 01:38:50.034
didn't.

1310
01:38:50.580 --> 01:38:55.580
And his trajectory in life just went down and I joined the navy,

1311
01:38:55.621 --> 01:38:59.340
which was great and it put me on a good path almost involuntarily,

1312
01:39:00.270 --> 01:39:04.800
but he ended up,
he ended up killing himself and you know,

1313
01:39:04.801 --> 01:39:07.680
it was drugs and it was alcohol and it was just bad.

1314
01:39:07.710 --> 01:39:09.720
But while I was going through buds,
he killed himself.

1315
01:39:10.050 --> 01:39:13.520
And what I tried to explain to the kids on the warrior could podcasts is like

1316
01:39:13.770 --> 01:39:17.100
the decisions that the little decisions that you make,

1317
01:39:17.640 --> 01:39:22.410
they matter and they add up and you have to connect those dots.

1318
01:39:22.500 --> 01:39:25.770
Otherwise you don't know where you're going to end up and it might be bad.

1319
01:39:28.470 --> 01:39:31.830
Cool.
Got your hand up quick bro.
Good job.

1320
01:39:33.810 --> 01:39:35.540
<v 7>I do,
I do Jocko.
Um,</v>

1321
01:39:35.790 --> 01:39:39.930
so first I'm going to say thank you for being here and continuing to inspire us

1322
01:39:39.931 --> 01:39:43.410
all.
I really appreciate it.
Um,
so a little backstory.

1323
01:39:43.411 --> 01:39:46.970
I'm currently a detective and a Police Department in New Jersey and uh,

1324
01:39:46.990 --> 01:39:50.730
sitting number one on the sergeant's list looking to get promoted about march or

1325
01:39:50.731 --> 01:39:51.510
April.

1326
01:39:51.510 --> 01:39:56.510
So my question is I'm going to be the youngest sergeant in the department and

1327
01:39:57.480 --> 01:40:01.800
not with a lot of experience.
Now I've never had an issue in the department,
um,

1328
01:40:02.160 --> 01:40:03.120
doing pretty well.

1329
01:40:03.720 --> 01:40:07.470
And as soon as that list came out and I was number one,

1330
01:40:07.910 --> 01:40:12.210
the tension just rows and when to look at this kid less than five years in the

1331
01:40:12.211 --> 01:40:13.560
job,
you know,

1332
01:40:13.740 --> 01:40:18.660
in his twenties and they already want to see me fail before I even got to the

1333
01:40:18.661 --> 01:40:19.494
position.

1334
01:40:19.500 --> 01:40:24.500
So I'm trying to mentally prepare myself in that role when I already know that

1335
01:40:25.591 --> 01:40:26.550
it's coming against me.

1336
01:40:26.880 --> 01:40:30.510
So what's your best advice for someone that is going to be,
you know,

1337
01:40:30.511 --> 01:40:31.950
in this position of,

1338
01:40:32.340 --> 01:40:34.770
see I was looking at every position as a leadership position,

1339
01:40:34.890 --> 01:40:37.980
but now structurally I'm going to be their supervisor.

1340
01:40:38.220 --> 01:40:43.170
So what's your best advice to,
to me going into that situation?
Yeah.
And this is

1341
01:40:43.440 --> 01:40:48.440
<v 5>same exact situation that military officers get put into military officers in</v>

1342
01:40:49.021 --> 01:40:51.330
the field teams and the Marine Corps and the army and the navy.

1343
01:40:51.690 --> 01:40:56.470
You're a kid that comes out of you have zero experience and you get put in

1344
01:40:56.471 --> 01:41:01.120
charge of a department on a ship or you get put in charge of a platoon and all

1345
01:41:01.121 --> 01:41:05.170
of a sudden you're a guy with zero experience and you got to platoon chief

1346
01:41:05.171 --> 01:41:09.010
that's been in for 16 years.
That's,
that's the way it works,

1347
01:41:09.220 --> 01:41:13.780
and so I've had to have this conversation over and over again and what we're

1348
01:41:13.781 --> 01:41:17.500
going to do is number one,
we're not going to act like we know everything.

1349
01:41:18.460 --> 01:41:19.840
Even if you do know more,

1350
01:41:19.870 --> 01:41:22.000
even if you have things more figured out than these guys,

1351
01:41:22.001 --> 01:41:25.000
if you go in there and act like it,
guess what they're going to do?

1352
01:41:25.810 --> 01:41:28.690
They're going to reject you.
Who is this young whipper snapper?

1353
01:41:28.750 --> 01:41:31.380
Young buck thinks he knows everything.
He doesn't know about this.

1354
01:41:31.400 --> 01:41:33.860
He doesn't know about that.
They'll sabotage you to make you look bad,

1355
01:41:35.050 --> 01:41:37.990
but if you go in there and you're humble,
I'm not talking about being a pushover,

1356
01:41:38.200 --> 01:41:39.850
I'm not talking about being weak,

1357
01:41:40.090 --> 01:41:43.210
but I'm going to lean towards being humble.

1358
01:41:43.240 --> 01:41:46.030
I'm going to lean towards listening to what they have to say.

1359
01:41:46.750 --> 01:41:49.210
I'm going to lean towards saying,
hey,

1360
01:41:49.360 --> 01:41:51.460
you don't have never handled a case like this before.

1361
01:41:51.490 --> 01:41:54.550
Do you have any perspective you can you help me out with this?
Instead of,
Hey,

1362
01:41:54.551 --> 01:41:58.360
this case is mine.
Let me show you how it's going to be.
That right there,

1363
01:41:58.390 --> 01:42:01.590
you're taking a relationship in a negative direction.
We want wanna.
We want,

1364
01:42:01.720 --> 01:42:05.110
we want to build a team and we want them to,
we want to get their respect.

1365
01:42:05.770 --> 01:42:09.460
How do you,
how do we get the respect we get?
We actually get respect.

1366
01:42:09.461 --> 01:42:14.380
As crazy as it sounds,
we get respect by,
by being humble.
So if,

1367
01:42:14.381 --> 01:42:17.800
if,
if echo,
if echo's working for me,
I show up,

1368
01:42:17.801 --> 01:42:20.320
he's more experienced than me and I show up and I say,
all right,

1369
01:42:20.321 --> 01:42:22.060
here's what we're doing.
Here's how we're doing this mission.

1370
01:42:22.360 --> 01:42:26.770
Here's how it's going to be my way and I think he knows what's up.

1371
01:42:26.771 --> 01:42:31.120
Now he knows he,
I'm the boss.
What's he actually thinking?

1372
01:42:32.170 --> 01:42:33.130
Who's this idiot?

1373
01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:38.080
That's how the job for three days and he thinks that he's going to tell me what

1374
01:42:38.081 --> 01:42:42.160
to do and he's going to,
he's going to resist it.
He's going to sabotage,

1375
01:42:42.340 --> 01:42:44.530
he's going to,
and we're going to have a bad relationship.

1376
01:42:44.770 --> 01:42:48.210
But if I come in and say,
hey,
echo,
really great to meet you and you know,

1377
01:42:48.220 --> 01:42:50.530
I'm just checking in here.
I was looking at your,

1378
01:42:50.560 --> 01:42:53.920
I was like checking out your record.
You've been here for a long time,
man.

1379
01:42:53.980 --> 01:42:56.590
You really nailed some big cases.
That's awesome.

1380
01:42:56.740 --> 01:42:57.970
I'm looking forward to working with you.

1381
01:42:57.971 --> 01:43:01.660
I'm looking forward to learning a lot from you
and boom,

1382
01:43:02.320 --> 01:43:05.800
what's his attitude towards me now?
Hey,
this kid is pretty humble.
Again,

1383
01:43:05.801 --> 01:43:10.690
I'm not coming in and saying I don't know anything.
Can you please,
you know,

1384
01:43:10.720 --> 01:43:15.010
show me the way.
Oh master,
no,
I'm not talking about that.
But just a nice,

1385
01:43:15.040 --> 01:43:18.610
respectful,
humble way of treating people study,

1386
01:43:18.820 --> 01:43:23.170
show up earlier than they do know the nomenclature that you're supposed to know.

1387
01:43:23.680 --> 01:43:26.200
Ask Good questions,
listen to the feedback.

1388
01:43:26.710 --> 01:43:28.320
And I've talked about this on the podcast.

1389
01:43:28.330 --> 01:43:31.780
If he comes up with a plan and I think I have a better plan,

1390
01:43:31.781 --> 01:43:35.530
but he's got a plan that's,
that's pretty solid.
Who's planning?
I got to pick,

1391
01:43:36.970 --> 01:43:40.990
I'm going to pick his plan.
I'm not going to force my plan down his throat.

1392
01:43:41.370 --> 01:43:44.230
It makes our relationship go backwards.

1393
01:43:44.410 --> 01:43:47.710
It makes him think that he needs to compete with me.
I don't want him to coffee.

1394
01:43:47.730 --> 01:43:50.050
Hey,
echo,
this is your plane.
He'd come up with it.
You,
you make it happen.

1395
01:43:51.410 --> 01:43:54.050
Echo always jokes in music.
I know you do this stuff to me

1396
01:43:56.650 --> 01:43:59.080
and he's like,
and it still works

1397
01:44:00.630 --> 01:44:01.000
<v 0>okay.</v>

1398
01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:05.020
<v 5>And I do.
You know,
I do.
It's like,
hey,
if he can come up with a plan,</v>

1399
01:44:05.230 --> 01:44:08.710
I would rather we execute his plan because then he cares more about it.

1400
01:44:09.640 --> 01:44:13.310
It's his.
So stay humble.
Listen,

1401
01:44:14.770 --> 01:44:18.290
work hard.
I appreciate that.
Thanks for your service brother.

1402
01:44:18.560 --> 01:44:21.610
[inaudible] front row shattered up quick.
Right here.

1403
01:44:24.390 --> 01:44:27.060
You got that thing up quick a game.

1404
01:44:28.710 --> 01:44:30.810
<v 8>All right.
First of all,
let y'all go.
Thank you for being out here in New York.</v>

1405
01:44:30.840 --> 01:44:34.130
It's great to finally see your live.
Um,
I just want to be respective.

1406
01:44:34.170 --> 01:44:37.440
You already elaborated some on communicating as a family.

1407
01:44:37.470 --> 01:44:39.450
He said you're gonna put some more content out regarding that stuff.

1408
01:44:39.451 --> 01:44:40.040
Hold on a second,

1409
01:44:40.040 --> 01:44:44.090
<v 5>Bro.
My hearing's not great.
Slow down.
Hit it with [inaudible].</v>

1410
01:44:44.220 --> 01:44:46.410
<v 8>Make it quick and simple.</v>

1411
01:44:46.440 --> 01:44:51.440
A top three rules on raising kids from ages three to nine.

1412
01:44:52.201 --> 01:44:55.380
Really getting that sort of attitude instilled while they're still young.

1413
01:44:55.560 --> 01:44:58.080
So not about the family,
like dynamic,
not about managing,

1414
01:44:58.081 --> 01:45:02.100
just the kids' attitudes.
Yeah,
it's with kids.

1415
01:45:02.640 --> 01:45:06.720
<v 5>Well,
you got to remember,
and this is the hardest thing for parents to deal with,</v>

1416
01:45:07.770 --> 01:45:12.770
is your kid is not going to be who you want them to be.

1417
01:45:13.440 --> 01:45:17.640
They're just not,
they're humans and they have there.

1418
01:45:17.670 --> 01:45:18.960
If that was the truth,

1419
01:45:19.050 --> 01:45:23.670
all of my kids would be the same type of kid and they would all,
you know,

1420
01:45:23.671 --> 01:45:27.330
you could just,
here's what they all do.
They're not there.
They're not.

1421
01:45:27.331 --> 01:45:30.210
Your kids are going to be different and your kid's going to be different from

1422
01:45:30.211 --> 01:45:32.730
you.
They might be a little bit better than you at some things.

1423
01:45:32.731 --> 01:45:34.110
They might be worse than you would other things.

1424
01:45:34.200 --> 01:45:38.670
So what you have to do is first of all,
get that idea out of your head.

1425
01:45:38.760 --> 01:45:40.260
That being said,

1426
01:45:40.410 --> 01:45:45.410
you can definitely provide guidance and you can definitely put them in,

1427
01:45:48.541 --> 01:45:50.010
guide them in the right direction.

1428
01:45:50.670 --> 01:45:55.670
But what you don't want to do is make every decision for them.

1429
01:45:57.150 --> 01:46:00.840
What you don't want to do is only let them do what you tell them to do.

1430
01:46:01.140 --> 01:46:02.910
They've got to learn to make decisions,

1431
01:46:03.150 --> 01:46:05.220
otherwise they can't go into the world and fend for themselves.

1432
01:46:05.370 --> 01:46:07.860
They've got to suffer consequences of their bad decisions,

1433
01:46:07.980 --> 01:46:12.600
otherwise they can't fend for themselves in the world.
So you have to,

1434
01:46:13.260 --> 01:46:14.550
I've said this before,
you have to,

1435
01:46:14.610 --> 01:46:17.850
you have to like let them brush up against the guard rails of failure.

1436
01:46:17.940 --> 01:46:19.120
You have to let them tie the one shoe.

1437
01:46:19.121 --> 01:46:24.121
You have to let them spill the milk and the more you

1438
01:46:26.250 --> 01:46:29.880
make or allow them to do for themselves,

1439
01:46:30.540 --> 01:46:32.610
the better human beings they're going to be.

1440
01:46:33.660 --> 01:46:38.660
The more that you do for them and force on them and impose on them,

1441
01:46:40.350 --> 01:46:42.150
the less they're going to know for themselves.

1442
01:46:42.210 --> 01:46:47.210
And the more they're going to rebel against the values that you're putting forth

1443
01:46:49.080 --> 01:46:51.690
them.
Again,
it's a dichotomy and I'm not saying,
Hey,

1444
01:46:51.691 --> 01:46:53.400
let your kids do whatever you have,
whatever they want.

1445
01:46:53.850 --> 01:46:57.750
When they go outside that box,
just give him a nice big box.

1446
01:46:57.930 --> 01:46:59.070
When they go outside of that,

1447
01:46:59.160 --> 01:47:01.620
you got to bring them back in and you've got to explain to them why you're

1448
01:47:01.621 --> 01:47:04.980
bringing them back in.
They got to understand that there's,

1449
01:47:05.010 --> 01:47:09.090
the reason they're not allowed to play in this area is because there's bad

1450
01:47:09.091 --> 01:47:11.880
people there or there's danger there is not just because I said so.

1451
01:47:12.960 --> 01:47:17.430
So you develop these relationships with your kid,
you guide them,

1452
01:47:18.030 --> 01:47:23.030
but you don't direct them and you let them be as much of a leader as they can be

1453
01:47:25.260 --> 01:47:26.700
and that's the best thing you can do for them.

1454
01:47:28.900 --> 01:47:29.590
<v 3>Thank you.</v>

1455
01:47:29.590 --> 01:47:34.590
Can I add one more thing to do that which actually Jocko opened my eyes to this

1456
01:47:35.140 --> 01:47:35.973
and it like,

1457
01:47:37.210 --> 01:47:40.320
like your kids are always watching you like always what?

1458
01:47:40.321 --> 01:47:44.280
So if you're yelling at mom or yelling at people on the phone or,
I don't know,

1459
01:47:44.290 --> 01:47:48.280
doing stuff,
you're doing stuff that you don't want them to do,
you can say,
Hey,

1460
01:47:48.281 --> 01:47:49.750
don't do this.
They'll be like,
cool.

1461
01:47:50.020 --> 01:47:51.690
But once they kind of get the opportunity there,

1462
01:47:51.700 --> 01:47:55.000
like I guess this is kind of how,
because dad does it,

1463
01:47:55.150 --> 01:47:57.690
especially with the yelling thing and losing lake.
Dot.

1464
01:47:57.700 --> 01:47:59.920
How do you deal with stress and stuff?
That's probably,

1465
01:47:59.921 --> 01:48:01.990
they'll jump right on that.
That's what I,

1466
01:48:02.200 --> 01:48:05.050
that's what I really noticed when actually when he opened my eyes to it,

1467
01:48:05.051 --> 01:48:09.370
I was like,
oh,
okay.
You know when you know sometimes you get kids or your kids,

1468
01:48:09.410 --> 01:48:13.750
how many kids you have.
Oh,
okay.

1469
01:48:14.160 --> 01:48:17.050
All right.
Well you're planning ahead.
Okay.
All right.
There you go.

1470
01:48:17.051 --> 01:48:21.230
We'll keep this in mind then.
Cause a lot of the times you're like,
oh,

1471
01:48:21.231 --> 01:48:23.440
your three year old.
Or He'd be like,
Dang,
where did they,

1472
01:48:23.441 --> 01:48:26.890
how did they pick that up?
I didn't teach them that.
And the thing is,

1473
01:48:26.891 --> 01:48:31.420
you probably will have taught them that just by doing it on your own,
you know?

1474
01:48:31.750 --> 01:48:35.350
Yeah.
The,
so they're always watching you.
So that make,
that helped me.

1475
01:48:35.351 --> 01:48:38.260
I think a lot type two kids

1476
01:48:38.590 --> 01:48:41.350
<v 5>tighten your game up a little bit around the kids.</v>

1477
01:48:44.770 --> 01:48:48.190
Let's see.
Really tall hand to back there you.

1478
01:48:49.740 --> 01:48:54.690
<v 8>Thank you.
So a very specific example then.
Um,
my son,
he's three.</v>

1479
01:48:54.720 --> 01:48:57.960
I would love for him to get into Brazilian Jujitsu just like me,

1480
01:48:58.230 --> 01:49:02.040
which I also got into.
Thanks to you two gentlemen.
Thank you very much.
Uh,

1481
01:49:02.041 --> 01:49:06.480
so how do I encourage him without pushing him,
without,
you know,

1482
01:49:06.930 --> 01:49:08.520
just getting him into it.
Really.

1483
01:49:09.520 --> 01:49:10.353
<v 0>Oh</v>

1484
01:49:10.570 --> 01:49:11.560
<v 5>you have to make it fun.</v>

1485
01:49:12.910 --> 01:49:17.910
You have to make it fun and it is much better for it to be fun once a week then

1486
01:49:19.541 --> 01:49:21.310
for them to hate it three times a week.

1487
01:49:22.030 --> 01:49:25.180
The kid that hates it three times a week and you think I'm doing them a favor?

1488
01:49:25.640 --> 01:49:28.630
I'm doing her a favor cause I got her in there.
Whether she likes it or not.

1489
01:49:29.050 --> 01:49:30.610
She's three years old,
bro.

1490
01:49:33.460 --> 01:49:34.293
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1491
01:49:34.510 --> 01:49:39.510
<v 5>The best possible thing you can do is not make them train Jujitsu right now.</v>

1492
01:49:41.050 --> 01:49:44.050
It's make them enjoy Jujitsu.
Right now.

1493
01:49:44.380 --> 01:49:48.370
I did not do this well with my kids.
I didn't,

1494
01:49:48.730 --> 01:49:53.500
it's horrible when my,
when my specialty,
my daughters,
my daughter,

1495
01:49:53.690 --> 01:49:56.860
they were very young.
It was Jujitsu,
Jujitsu,
Jujitsu.
We were doing,

1496
01:49:57.100 --> 01:49:59.530
they were doing Jujitsu six days a week.

1497
01:50:05.860 --> 01:50:10.600
They were like six.
And that was,

1498
01:50:10.601 --> 01:50:14.110
that was,
that was part of it.
Let me tell you what I did.
That's worse.

1499
01:50:15.010 --> 01:50:17.650
What's worse is I was like,
okay,

1500
01:50:17.680 --> 01:50:20.590
you're also going to compete cause competing makes you better.

1501
01:50:21.600 --> 01:50:25.810
And it gets worse because then it was,
oh,
when I take you to compete,

1502
01:50:25.811 --> 01:50:30.280
since I'm the coach,
I'm going to put you in a higher weight class.

1503
01:50:31.390 --> 01:50:35.320
I'm going to put you against,
uh,
older kids.

1504
01:50:36.310 --> 01:50:40.270
And you know what?
If you lose,
look,
if you lose,

1505
01:50:40.360 --> 01:50:43.300
it doesn't matter because you're going to be tougher.
So,

1506
01:50:43.301 --> 01:50:46.510
so just go out there and do your best.
If you lose,
don't worry about it.

1507
01:50:46.511 --> 01:50:51.430
It's gonna make you tougher.
So my daughters go to compete in Jujitsu Tournament,

1508
01:50:51.431 --> 01:50:55.470
Jujitsu Tournament,
Jujitsu tournament.
What happens to them?
They get beat.

1509
01:50:55.800 --> 01:50:59.200
I get beat by someone that's older.
They get beat by someone that's heavier.

1510
01:50:59.500 --> 01:51:03.370
Is that fun?
No,
that sucks.

1511
01:51:05.110 --> 01:51:09.910
What do I think?
What is the idiot think?
Oh,
you're getting tougher.

1512
01:51:11.050 --> 01:51:13.300
And so by the time they were 10,
it was like,

1513
01:51:13.360 --> 01:51:16.900
I don't want to do any of this crap anymore.
And

1514
01:51:18.820 --> 01:51:22.690
it got to a point where I was like,
okay,
look,
this is ridiculous.
Um,
I'm,

1515
01:51:22.760 --> 01:51:26.570
I realized the mistake that I made and I just had to back off and,

1516
01:51:26.730 --> 01:51:31.480
and luckily my son made it through that time period where he,

1517
01:51:31.510 --> 01:51:36.510
he kept training all the time and became very good at Jujitsu and wrestling.

1518
01:51:38.050 --> 01:51:41.550
But with the girls,
I,

1519
01:51:42.540 --> 01:51:43.570
I didn't do it right.

1520
01:51:43.750 --> 01:51:48.370
So find a good school where the Jujitsu is fun.

1521
01:51:48.730 --> 01:51:51.600
Don't force it down their throat.
Let me tell you one more really quick story.
My,

1522
01:51:51.740 --> 01:51:54.670
my son had a friend who was like,
you know,

1523
01:51:54.671 --> 01:51:59.490
his running mate and when he was six years old,
I said,
yeah,

1524
01:51:59.620 --> 01:52:01.360
we'll bring your stuff that you did to let him try it.

1525
01:52:01.870 --> 01:52:03.970
He tried it at six years old.
He didn't like you tried it one time.

1526
01:52:03.971 --> 01:52:05.570
I don't like it.
Got Choked in the crime.

1527
01:52:07.510 --> 01:52:11.580
He tried it at age seven.
Hey,
we'll try it again.
Didn't like it,
hated it,

1528
01:52:11.760 --> 01:52:15.850
tried it at a j,
didn't like it.
Hated it.
Age Nine his dad trained,

1529
01:52:15.880 --> 01:52:19.120
his dad had started training his,
he kind of got to look at like,
oh,

1530
01:52:19.121 --> 01:52:22.540
that's pretty cool.
By the time he was nine and he tried it,

1531
01:52:22.630 --> 01:52:27.630
he liked it and he liked it because he liked it and he was then old enough to

1532
01:52:28.211 --> 01:52:31.720
make the decision and want to train and started training hard and he got good

1533
01:52:31.721 --> 01:52:36.700
really quick.
It wasn't like,
oh he missed those four years of training.

1534
01:52:36.940 --> 01:52:40.750
They didn't make a big difference is my point.
They don't make a big difference.

1535
01:52:40.990 --> 01:52:45.990
So the most important thing you can do as a parent is make it fun for your kids.

1536
01:52:47.420 --> 01:52:51.020
Make working out fun.
Make Jujitsu Fun,

1537
01:52:51.200 --> 01:52:55.610
make school fun.
Make these things enjoyable.
Make let them win.

1538
01:52:55.760 --> 01:52:57.650
You don't put them in positions where they're going to win.

1539
01:52:58.130 --> 01:53:01.220
And I'm not saying every time,
because you do have to learn how to lose.

1540
01:53:01.280 --> 01:53:05.090
Let them learn to lose when they occasionally let them learn to lose when they

1541
01:53:05.091 --> 01:53:07.070
get older,
but

1542
01:53:08.860 --> 01:53:09.730
<v 4>make it fun for him.</v>

1543
01:53:11.190 --> 01:53:15.330
<v 5>That's the key.
Uh,
I'm going to eventually get balcony up there,</v>

1544
01:53:15.331 --> 01:53:18.510
but um,
I guess Jew in the back

1545
01:53:19.180 --> 01:53:20.013
<v 4>go</v>

1546
01:53:21.550 --> 01:53:24.680
<v 3>Jacko my questions on the other end of the spectrum for a police officer,</v>

1547
01:53:25.730 --> 01:53:28.880
I'm a battalion chief and the Fire Department,
28 years on the department,

1548
01:53:29.600 --> 01:53:33.020
how do I relate to the 19 year old?

1549
01:53:33.380 --> 01:53:38.300
Can you relay a story that you worked with a 19 year old new seal

1550
01:53:39.040 --> 01:53:41.590
<v 5>and you're trying to get what to happen?</v>

1551
01:53:41.900 --> 01:53:43.400
<v 3>One developed that relationship with them.</v>

1552
01:53:43.401 --> 01:53:47.270
You talked about the relationship above me as a leader.

1553
01:53:47.390 --> 01:53:51.110
How do I develop that relationship for the newer people below me?

1554
01:53:52.070 --> 01:53:55.250
<v 5>The best way,
okay.
When we start talking about relationships,
and I,</v>

1555
01:53:55.320 --> 01:53:56.180
I mentioned this earlier,

1556
01:53:56.181 --> 01:54:00.350
what our relationship is is the relationship is trust and that's what a team is.

1557
01:54:00.351 --> 01:54:02.570
A team is a bunch of people,
the relationship that all trust each other.

1558
01:54:02.960 --> 01:54:05.780
How do I develop trust with someone that's below me in the chain of command?

1559
01:54:06.710 --> 01:54:10.250
What I did.
This is what I did to make this happen.

1560
01:54:11.090 --> 01:54:14.600
As a platoon commander,
as a task unit commander,
as I was in charge of training,

1561
01:54:15.110 --> 01:54:19.850
is those young guys that are coming in.
I gave them responsibility,

1562
01:54:20.240 --> 01:54:22.250
I put them in leadership positions.

1563
01:54:22.490 --> 01:54:25.370
I remember the first time I took over a platoon with a platoon commander got

1564
01:54:25.371 --> 01:54:30.371
fired and we had a training operations that night and I said,

1565
01:54:30.740 --> 01:54:34.820
I said a between chief.
I said,
hey,
who's like a,
uh,
a squared away June,

1566
01:54:34.850 --> 01:54:36.860
really junior guy.
And he gave me a name and I said,
okay,

1567
01:54:36.861 --> 01:54:40.040
he's going to run this mission tonight.
And the platoon was like,
Whoa,
wait,

1568
01:54:40.120 --> 01:54:43.040
what are you talking about?
This kid's going to run the mission.
Yup.

1569
01:54:43.760 --> 01:54:46.160
And all of a sudden,
what's the kid thinking,
wow,

1570
01:54:46.370 --> 01:54:49.430
this guy trusts me to do this.

1571
01:54:50.480 --> 01:54:54.680
I'm going to do a good job for him.
And since he trusts me,

1572
01:54:55.460 --> 01:54:59.630
I'm starting to trust him.
And the more you do that,

1573
01:54:59.631 --> 01:55:03.680
the more you push down that responsibility and you let people lead and you put

1574
01:55:03.681 --> 01:55:05.930
trust into them,
the more they're going to trust you.

1575
01:55:06.110 --> 01:55:10.010
As long as when something does go wrong,

1576
01:55:10.190 --> 01:55:14.510
you don't chop their head off.
When something does go wrong,
you say,

1577
01:55:14.540 --> 01:55:17.390
hey look,
let's,
let's take a look at it.
Let's see.
We can learn from it.

1578
01:55:17.960 --> 01:55:21.230
And you know what?
Probably my fault cause I didn't give you very good guidance.

1579
01:55:21.800 --> 01:55:24.770
So let's learn from it and we'll try it again.
You know what?

1580
01:55:24.771 --> 01:55:28.370
You're gonna run the same mission tomorrow night.
I know you can do this.

1581
01:55:29.120 --> 01:55:31.400
That's how you build that trust up and that's how you build a team.

1582
01:55:33.620 --> 01:55:35.570
Hand came up quick right there.

1583
01:55:37.600 --> 01:55:39.670
It's amazing that you can tell him what I'm pointing out.

1584
01:55:43.560 --> 01:55:44.490
<v 4>Jocko Echo.</v>

1585
01:55:44.490 --> 01:55:46.680
<v 7>Thank you for everything that you've given us.</v>

1586
01:55:48.420 --> 01:55:51.660
Acknowledging that we all have secrets.
Jocko,

1587
01:55:53.760 --> 01:55:58.290
what would you need to see happen that would change your mind about a run at

1588
01:55:58.291 --> 01:56:01.530
public office?
What?
Let me finish.

1589
01:56:04.570 --> 01:56:08.200
What would be that trigger event to make you say,
okay,

1590
01:56:09.280 --> 01:56:11.830
public office.
Stand by to get some.

1591
01:56:12.350 --> 01:56:13.183
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1592
01:56:14.770 --> 01:56:19.770
[inaudible]

1593
01:56:23.290 --> 01:56:26.200
<v 7>I'll finish by saying white.
Frankly,
you have a nation of troopers,</v>

1594
01:56:26.210 --> 01:56:30.250
both foreign and domestic that believe and know that you're qualified to lead

1595
01:56:30.880 --> 01:56:32.680
and ready to lend their support.

1596
01:56:38.100 --> 01:56:38.933
<v 0>MMM.</v>

1597
01:56:40.450 --> 01:56:43.570
<v 5>What would it take?
There is a line somewhere.</v>

1598
01:56:44.470 --> 01:56:46.720
There is a line somewhere where,

1599
01:56:47.320 --> 01:56:51.430
where I would feel like,
okay,
the,

1600
01:56:52.150 --> 01:56:56.200
you know,
the country needs me.
Um,

1601
01:56:56.770 --> 01:57:01.390
it's,
it's a pretty distinct line.
It's,

1602
01:57:01.420 --> 01:57:02.320
it's,

1603
01:57:05.560 --> 01:57:08.410
that world is so,

1604
01:57:09.840 --> 01:57:10.500
<v 0>yeah.</v>

1605
01:57:10.500 --> 01:57:12.990
<v 5>I don't want to use the word corrupt.</v>

1606
01:57:14.160 --> 01:57:14.993
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1607
01:57:18.130 --> 01:57:20.350
<v 5>But,
but,
but because that's not what I'm talking about.</v>

1608
01:57:20.351 --> 01:57:23.440
Not talking about like that kind of corruption and there's corruption for sure.

1609
01:57:23.530 --> 01:57:24.191
But you know,

1610
01:57:24.191 --> 01:57:28.960
you compare the corruption that we have to the rest of the world and it's very

1611
01:57:28.961 --> 01:57:32.620
nice.
But there's a different word that I can't quite capture.

1612
01:57:34.780 --> 01:57:39.640
There's,
there's dishonesty.
There's stored,
I don't mind the chaos.

1613
01:57:39.700 --> 01:57:44.470
Um,
some selfishness.
Um,

1614
01:57:47.500 --> 01:57:48.580
here's what it is.

1615
01:57:50.410 --> 01:57:54.670
I think in order,
I like,

1616
01:57:55.120 --> 01:57:59.170
I like when things go wrong.

1617
01:58:00.740 --> 01:58:02.390
I know that sounds crazy,

1618
01:58:02.850 --> 01:58:07.850
but one of my biggest problems is that I get when things are going good,

1619
01:58:07.971 --> 01:58:12.810
I get really bored pretty quickly and I just like,
oh yeah,
that's cool.
Oh,

1620
01:58:12.820 --> 01:58:16.070
we,
hey,
the business is doing this,
like my business.
Like,
Hey,
we're doing this.

1621
01:58:16.071 --> 01:58:18.330
And I'm like,
all right,
awesome.
We're going right there.
Okay,
cool.
Well what,

1622
01:58:18.331 --> 01:58:20.000
what can I look at next?
Like I get,

1623
01:58:20.060 --> 01:58:24.980
I get kind of bored when things are going well and when things are going bad,

1624
01:58:25.940 --> 01:58:26.900
I love it.

1625
01:58:28.560 --> 01:58:33.560
I really like when things are going bad and so in the government

1626
01:58:36.180 --> 01:58:38.250
things don't get that bad.

1627
01:58:39.420 --> 01:58:44.290
And for me to put my time and effort towards something,
all that,
you know,

1628
01:58:44.800 --> 01:58:48.430
really focus,
I would get bored very quickly because you know how to be like,
Hey,

1629
01:58:48.431 --> 01:58:52.890
you know what?
We're not doing too bad.
And so until there's something

1630
01:58:54.160 --> 01:58:54.470
<v 4>okay</v>

1631
01:58:54.470 --> 01:58:58.910
<v 5>bad that I feel like,
okay,
it's time.</v>

1632
01:58:59.210 --> 01:59:02.670
That's kind of what would,
would,
would make me roll in that direction.
Um,

1633
01:59:02.720 --> 01:59:06.650
it seems like a miserable life to me.
It seems like a miserable life.

1634
01:59:07.160 --> 01:59:12.160
It seems like a life where you're constantly putting up a facade and I don't

1635
01:59:14.601 --> 01:59:15.710
have the desire to do that.
You know,

1636
01:59:15.711 --> 01:59:20.711
I never got interested in going into the CIA or anything like that because I

1637
01:59:21.441 --> 01:59:24.890
never wanted to live that kind of life.
And it does,
I'm not saying it's bad.

1638
01:59:24.891 --> 01:59:28.730
I mean the guys worked with them and they're awesome,
but it's just not me.

1639
01:59:29.210 --> 01:59:31.190
And I don't like to live that way.

1640
01:59:31.430 --> 01:59:35.990
And it seems like there's a lot of that except the fact that if we got into a

1641
01:59:35.991 --> 01:59:40.991
position as a nation where things were really bad and we needed some,

1642
01:59:43.100 --> 01:59:44.630
we needed to take action,

1643
01:59:45.710 --> 01:59:49.880
then I feel like I would step into it.
But man,

1644
01:59:49.910 --> 01:59:51.680
I hope we don't get there.
Let me put you that way.

1645
01:59:51.890 --> 01:59:53.840
I hope we don't get there and I don't think we will,

1646
01:59:54.560 --> 01:59:58.010
but I appreciate the South Porch and I'm sorry,

1647
02:00:00.130 --> 02:00:02.150
a red jacket.

1648
02:00:06.200 --> 02:00:09.200
Oh,
first off,
thank you for everything you do.
And then,
um,

1649
02:00:09.201 --> 02:00:12.530
my question is who we are role models growing up and like what qualities did

1650
02:00:12.531 --> 02:00:17.310
they have?
Uh,
well my,

1651
02:00:17.340 --> 02:00:22.340
my first legitimate role models that I looked at and said,

1652
02:00:22.600 --> 02:00:26.680
okay,
that's a person that I can emulate.
That was when I got to the seal teams.

1653
02:00:27.010 --> 02:00:31.720
Up to that point,
I was looking,
I was a confused kid that was looking at this,

1654
02:00:31.900 --> 02:00:34.990
you know,
this person,
that person,
but I didn't really,

1655
02:00:35.490 --> 02:00:37.330
even though even I wasn't confused enough to be like,
oh,

1656
02:00:37.331 --> 02:00:39.970
I'm going to be like that person and follow what they're doing,

1657
02:00:40.120 --> 02:00:43.120
I would look at people I got that seems pretty cool.
That seems pretty cool.

1658
02:00:43.540 --> 02:00:47.560
And so it wasn't till I got into the seal teams and there were some people that

1659
02:00:47.561 --> 02:00:51.040
you instantly,
when I checked into seal team one,
I'm like,
that guy's awesome.

1660
02:00:51.700 --> 02:00:54.340
I've got w that that person right there is awesome.

1661
02:00:54.490 --> 02:00:55.960
I'm going to do my best to emulate that person.

1662
02:00:56.170 --> 02:01:01.170
And there was probably five or seven people at seal team one when I got there

1663
02:01:02.080 --> 02:01:07.080
that I stole as much as I could in terms of how to behave and,

1664
02:01:07.900 --> 02:01:08.733
and that was it.

1665
02:01:09.070 --> 02:01:13.780
You know a guy named master chief faculty who was super just ultra professional

1666
02:01:13.781 --> 02:01:16.150
and everything,
and I was like,
he's so professional.

1667
02:01:16.450 --> 02:01:20.830
No one can say anything to him because he's a professional.

1668
02:01:20.950 --> 02:01:24.280
Like I'm going to,
I'm going to be like that.
There was a couple other,

1669
02:01:24.310 --> 02:01:29.260
there was other guys that I unfortunately mashing faculty died so I'm using his

1670
02:01:29.261 --> 02:01:34.090
name but other guys that I just looked at and said,
wow,
that guy's awesome.

1671
02:01:34.810 --> 02:01:38.980
So I didn't really have like those kinds of role models until I got to the

1672
02:01:40.100 --> 02:01:40.933
<v 4>no.</v>

1673
02:01:42.840 --> 02:01:45.930
<v 5>Uh,
okay.
Balkin is there anyone on the balcony microphones style</v>

1674
02:01:47.830 --> 02:01:48.663
<v 4>right there</v>

1675
02:01:49.880 --> 02:01:51.470
<v 5>up in the cheap seats.</v>

1676
02:01:57.700 --> 02:01:58.160
<v 4>Okay.</v>

1677
02:01:58.160 --> 02:02:01.610
<v 5>Jacko Echo.
Thank you for your podcast.
Jocko.
Think we service Nico,</v>

1678
02:02:01.611 --> 02:02:03.050
thank you for the work that you uh,

1679
02:02:03.260 --> 02:02:06.620
you work with Jocko and doing the podcasts also thank you to the men and women

1680
02:02:06.621 --> 02:02:10.010
in the service present future and past.
Um,

1681
02:02:10.250 --> 02:02:14.270
I come from a corporate environment working,
doing it support.
Now.

1682
02:02:14.300 --> 02:02:18.590
My recent role was where I was responsible for supporting 40 to 80 people,

1683
02:02:19.340 --> 02:02:23.360
pretty much solo.
And with that I had a manager remote,
you know,

1684
02:02:23.361 --> 02:02:25.670
I had a good working relationship with them.
He's former military,

1685
02:02:26.360 --> 02:02:29.480
so he would tell me,
do certain things within the environment,
which I would do,

1686
02:02:29.720 --> 02:02:34.160
but then his manager would come down and visit and sometimes give me

1687
02:02:34.161 --> 02:02:37.280
contradicting situations or orders.

1688
02:02:37.520 --> 02:02:41.630
So what do you do when you have your boss telling you one thing?
His boss,

1689
02:02:42.050 --> 02:02:45.500
your bosses,
direct response report telling you to do something contradictory.

1690
02:02:46.010 --> 02:02:49.090
Yup.
Pretty straight forward.
If,
if my boss,

1691
02:02:49.091 --> 02:02:52.070
his boss comes to me and tells me to do something,
I'm like,
Hey,

1692
02:02:52.071 --> 02:02:54.830
I just want to make sure that you know that this is what I've been told to do.

1693
02:02:54.920 --> 02:02:57.470
And then they say,
yeah,
I don't care what that guy says.
And you go,

1694
02:02:57.500 --> 02:03:01.670
okay Roger that.
And then he leaves you go,
Hey,
direct Voss,

1695
02:03:01.790 --> 02:03:05.540
here's what's going on.
Boss came down and told me to do this.
I'm here,

1696
02:03:05.541 --> 02:03:09.010
I work for you.
You're my boss and I want to tell you what's going on.
Um,

1697
02:03:09.500 --> 02:03:13.160
do you want me to proceed or do you want me to stop?
I want to keep you informed.

1698
02:03:13.280 --> 02:03:14.210
Here's why.

1699
02:03:15.410 --> 02:03:15.870
<v 4>Okay,</v>

1700
02:03:15.870 --> 02:03:19.590
<v 5>I want to,
I want to do the right thing and this is what's going on.</v>

1701
02:03:19.800 --> 02:03:24.720
So just take the information from the boss or the boss's boss.

1702
02:03:24.990 --> 02:03:29.850
Got It.
Have you told you know my boss that,
nope,
don't care.
Okay.

1703
02:03:29.851 --> 02:03:33.900
You don't care.
Fine.
Hey boss,
your boss is telling me to do this.

1704
02:03:33.901 --> 02:03:35.130
I want to let you know what's going on.

1705
02:03:35.790 --> 02:03:40.790
It's obviously a tenuous situation because then this guy up above the higher

1706
02:03:42.601 --> 02:03:45.840
diamond chain of command and all this,
you didn't do what I told you to do.
Hey,

1707
02:03:46.080 --> 02:03:48.780
look,
I'm,
I'm just trying to make sure everyone's informed and,

1708
02:03:49.000 --> 02:03:53.520
and that's the way,
that's the way things run.
Smooth dust.
If everyone's informed,

1709
02:03:53.790 --> 02:03:54.960
I'm here to support.

1710
02:03:55.740 --> 02:03:59.740
Can you guys talk to each other so I know what I'm supposed to be doing down

1711
02:03:59.790 --> 02:04:00.623
<v 4>here?</v>

1712
02:04:01.650 --> 02:04:01.830
<v 5>You,</v>

1713
02:04:01.830 --> 02:04:06.830
you got to kind of be the person that that connects the dots here to the best of

1714
02:04:07.091 --> 02:04:07.924
your ability.

1715
02:04:09.350 --> 02:04:10.183
<v 4>No problem.</v>

1716
02:04:10.930 --> 02:04:11.171
<v 8>All right.</v>

1717
02:04:11.171 --> 02:04:14.830
Let's say you're in an organization and you really want to see it succeed,

1718
02:04:14.831 --> 02:04:17.080
but it's being led by someone who is a,

1719
02:04:17.710 --> 02:04:20.530
not only steering it in the wrong direction,

1720
02:04:20.531 --> 02:04:24.640
they're doing it deliberately and you're not really sure if you can negotiate

1721
02:04:24.641 --> 02:04:26.960
with them.
What would your course,

1722
02:04:29.460 --> 02:04:30.390
<v 5>my course of action,</v>

1723
02:04:30.391 --> 02:04:33.270
if there's someone above me in the chain of command that's staring us in the

1724
02:04:33.271 --> 02:04:36.630
wrong direction,
I'm going to do my best to influence and persuade them.

1725
02:04:36.900 --> 02:04:37.950
If I can't do that,

1726
02:04:37.951 --> 02:04:41.310
I'm going to do the best to mitigate the risk down the chain of command and the

1727
02:04:41.311 --> 02:04:45.660
strategic risk.
I'm going to do my best to mitigate it,
and while I'm doing that,

1728
02:04:45.720 --> 02:04:50.720
I'm going to try and inform the other people around that person of the situation

1729
02:04:52.141 --> 02:04:53.880
that's going on.
I'm going to,

1730
02:04:53.881 --> 02:04:58.470
I'm going to build relationships with the C.
Oh,
with the CFO,

1731
02:04:58.570 --> 02:05:02.050
with the,
with the,
the CEO you're talking about.
Or if it's the battalion you,

1732
02:05:02.051 --> 02:05:02.884
whoever it is,

1733
02:05:02.910 --> 02:05:06.420
I'm going to build some relationships with other people so we can get that

1734
02:05:06.421 --> 02:05:07.500
person under control.

1735
02:05:08.040 --> 02:05:11.700
The other thing we have to remember is sometimes at the bottom,

1736
02:05:11.730 --> 02:05:16.530
we don't understand what the strategy is,
and so my first thing is like,

1737
02:05:16.531 --> 02:05:19.440
hey boss,
can you explain to me why we're doing this?
Because I,

1738
02:05:19.441 --> 02:05:21.480
it doesn't seem right to me for the following reasons.

1739
02:05:21.690 --> 02:05:23.310
I want to be able to support what you're saying.

1740
02:05:23.460 --> 02:05:26.820
Can you tell me why we're doing it this way?
So sometimes they say,
oh yeah,

1741
02:05:26.821 --> 02:05:29.010
it's because of this.
I should have explained that.
Sometimes they say,

1742
02:05:29.011 --> 02:05:29.700
wait a second,

1743
02:05:29.700 --> 02:05:32.220
what do you mean my strategy's not working down on the front lines?

1744
02:05:32.850 --> 02:05:34.470
They don't know.
No one's telling them.

1745
02:05:35.310 --> 02:05:38.900
So you have to communicate with them to make sure that,

1746
02:05:39.150 --> 02:05:42.810
that they understand that to make sure that you understand what direction you're

1747
02:05:42.811 --> 02:05:45.510
supposed to be heading and to make sure that they understand why it's

1748
02:05:45.511 --> 02:05:49.800
problematic on the front lines.
If all of that fails and they're just looking,

1749
02:05:49.970 --> 02:05:53.340
the telling you to be quiet and they're moving forward in something that's gonna

1750
02:05:53.520 --> 02:05:55.320
really be detrimental to the organization.

1751
02:05:55.590 --> 02:05:59.560
We got to start trying to figure out how to flank that person and,

1752
02:05:59.650 --> 02:06:00.480
and building it,

1753
02:06:00.480 --> 02:06:04.650
building a alliances with people that can try and get us going in the right way.

1754
02:06:05.720 --> 02:06:09.990
Thank you.
Sorry.
And of course there's,
you know,
there's situations where,

1755
02:06:10.610 --> 02:06:12.270
you know,
especially in the business environment,

1756
02:06:12.271 --> 02:06:16.080
like if you're in a ship and the ship is sinking and you sounded the alarm and

1757
02:06:16.081 --> 02:06:16.914
you've tried to,

1758
02:06:16.950 --> 02:06:21.750
you've tried to plug the holes and you've told everyone and they're still just

1759
02:06:21.900 --> 02:06:24.300
staying on board,
the sinking ship without making any corrections.

1760
02:06:24.510 --> 02:06:25.680
There are times we've gotta go,
you know what?

1761
02:06:25.681 --> 02:06:28.680
This ship is sinking and I'm not going to stay on it.

1762
02:06:30.120 --> 02:06:35.010
That can happen.
We can't,
you can't save every sinking ship.
You can't,

1763
02:06:35.610 --> 02:06:37.140
and you've got to know when it's time to go.
Okay,

1764
02:06:37.410 --> 02:06:39.390
I'm going to take the lessons learned.
I'm going to go somewhere else.

1765
02:06:40.390 --> 02:06:43.030
<v 6>Thank you.
Yes.
Okay.</v>

1766
02:06:44.020 --> 02:06:49.020
First I want to thank you because I am a stage four cancer survivor

1767
02:06:51.710 --> 02:06:56.710
<v 0>[inaudible]</v>

1768
02:07:00.570 --> 02:07:05.570
<v 6>in my darkest hours that a lot of people can't comprehend.</v>

1769
02:07:06.000 --> 02:07:10.110
You were there with me,
your voice,
your everything.

1770
02:07:10.160 --> 02:07:11.850
Still to this day,
I mean,

1771
02:07:12.030 --> 02:07:16.770
discipline equals freedom is a common phrase in my family over the most

1772
02:07:16.771 --> 02:07:20.250
monumental to the most ridiculous things like letting the dog out at the same

1773
02:07:20.251 --> 02:07:24.570
time,
you know.
Um,
so I want to thank you for that.
With that being said,

1774
02:07:25.020 --> 02:07:28.560
I have at one point plans my own funeral.

1775
02:07:28.920 --> 02:07:31.380
Didn't think I was going to be here for my kids,
you know,

1776
02:07:31.770 --> 02:07:34.650
the worst part of anybody's dreams,

1777
02:07:34.930 --> 02:07:39.930
nightmares and then to be at the place where I am right now and not knowing,

1778
02:07:40.600 --> 02:07:43.180
obviously I'm young and you know what the future holds.

1779
02:07:43.340 --> 02:07:48.130
Nobody's naive how you've been in those similar positions,

1780
02:07:48.131 --> 02:07:52.810
just not health wise but you know,
facing death and everything else.

1781
02:07:53.050 --> 02:07:57.640
How do you switch from that mindset of like you said when things are going

1782
02:07:57.641 --> 02:08:02.290
really bad,
I'm freaking awesome.
Like I kick ass.
Like I really do.

1783
02:08:02.740 --> 02:08:06.660
And then when things are kind of calm I'm like,
what do I do now?
Like wow,

1784
02:08:06.670 --> 02:08:09.520
am I going to,
you know,
even when you were just saying like your last line,

1785
02:08:09.521 --> 02:08:12.940
sometimes they think like you just speak to me.
It's so creepy that

1786
02:08:15.990 --> 02:08:19.510
I,
my last chemo was Friday.
I shouldn't be well today,

1787
02:08:19.540 --> 02:08:22.140
but I am because I knew I had to be here,
you know?
So

1788
02:08:22.710 --> 02:08:27.710
<v 0>[inaudible]</v>

1789
02:08:32.850 --> 02:08:36.300
<v 6>and then when you said that,
you know,
at the end of your podcast that,
you know,</v>

1790
02:08:36.330 --> 02:08:39.180
I'm gonna live life,
I'm going to live my days.

1791
02:08:39.390 --> 02:08:43.380
How did you get from that transition from,
you know,
possibly,

1792
02:08:43.381 --> 02:08:45.390
I don't know if I'm going to come out of this battle.

1793
02:08:45.391 --> 02:08:49.470
I don't know if I'm going to come home to,
okay,
I'm here,
life speaking.
Great,

1794
02:08:49.471 --> 02:08:54.060
let's party.
And then in between,
like did you have any,
um,

1795
02:08:54.090 --> 02:08:54.950
like how did you do,

1796
02:08:55.110 --> 02:09:00.090
how did you get from the darkest places to the brightest places and then bring

1797
02:09:00.091 --> 02:09:04.080
everything?
My problem is,
is I want to bring,
I,
I've learned my lesson,

1798
02:09:04.140 --> 02:09:08.910
like I've learned what I had to have learned now and now to bring it forward

1799
02:09:08.911 --> 02:09:12.930
with me,
but not to let it define me,
if that makes sense.

1800
02:09:17.370 --> 02:09:18.090
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1801
02:09:18.090 --> 02:09:23.090
<v 5>And I actually gave this answer to Sam Harris because Sam Harris said to me,</v>

1802
02:09:26.030 --> 02:09:28.220
you know,
Jocko,
you've,
you,

1803
02:09:28.280 --> 02:09:33.280
you talk about combat as your fondest memories and you know,

1804
02:09:35.421 --> 02:09:38.180
the,
the best thing that happened in your life.
It's the high point your life,

1805
02:09:38.181 --> 02:09:42.020
which is all true.
And he said,
but then you talk about war being awful.

1806
02:09:43.160 --> 02:09:45.530
So which one is it?

1807
02:09:48.480 --> 02:09:50.160
And I said to him,
I said,

1808
02:09:50.190 --> 02:09:55.190
have you ever known anyone that has had cancer terminal cancer and made it

1809
02:09:58.021 --> 02:10:02.880
through?
Have you ever known anyone that that's happened too?
And he's like,

1810
02:10:02.970 --> 02:10:04.110
yes.
And I said,

1811
02:10:04.111 --> 02:10:09.111
when you talked to them many times they say,

1812
02:10:09.960 --> 02:10:14.580
I'm glad that this happened to me,
number one,

1813
02:10:14.581 --> 02:10:17.580
because it proved I could take it.
Number two,

1814
02:10:17.610 --> 02:10:21.810
it's better me than one of my kids and number three,

1815
02:10:22.050 --> 02:10:24.990
now that I know how dark he can get,

1816
02:10:27.650 --> 02:10:32.300
I truly appreciate the light in the world.

1817
02:10:34.930 --> 02:10:37.900
That's what combat is and was for me.

1818
02:10:39.070 --> 02:10:40.390
That's what it was.

1819
02:10:40.660 --> 02:10:45.660
It was dark and horrible and I wouldn't wish it on anyone just like you wouldn't

1820
02:10:45.971 --> 02:10:48.370
wish cancer on anyone.

1821
02:10:50.350 --> 02:10:51.183
<v 4>But</v>

1822
02:10:52.480 --> 02:10:55.660
<v 5>if I can give them a little knowledge.</v>

1823
02:10:56.730 --> 02:10:57.120
<v 4>Okay.</v>

1824
02:10:57.120 --> 02:11:00.630
<v 5>A little bit of a glimpse in to what it is.</v>

1825
02:11:00.720 --> 02:11:03.000
Just like when you stand up here,
people,

1826
02:11:03.001 --> 02:11:07.740
crap when you said that people are clapping because they get to see a little bit

1827
02:11:07.741 --> 02:11:12.360
of it and they go home tonight and they think,
oh,
what about that girl?

1828
02:11:13.860 --> 02:11:18.350
What about that girl
she's fighting,

1829
02:11:19.280 --> 02:11:20.930
she's living

1830
02:11:23.460 --> 02:11:24.570
and I'm going to live too.

1831
02:11:26.000 --> 02:11:27.410
<v 4>Maybe that's why it had to have cancer.</v>

1832
02:11:29.230 --> 02:11:30.370
<v 5>That's how I look at things.
Now.</v>

1833
02:11:31.360 --> 02:11:36.360
I don't pretend to have the cognitive capacity to comprehend the mysteries of

1834
02:11:43.811 --> 02:11:47.770
the world,
but maybe you're right

1835
02:11:49.600 --> 02:11:52.750
and maybe you're here to let us know

1836
02:11:54.280 --> 02:11:58.330
that it can get dark,
but it will get light again.

1837
02:11:59.290 --> 02:12:00.940
Absolutely.
And thank you.

1838
02:12:01.890 --> 02:12:02.251
<v 4>Awesome.</v>

1839
02:12:02.251 --> 02:12:07.251
[inaudible]

1840
02:12:17.310 --> 02:12:18.143
yes.

1841
02:12:21.460 --> 02:12:23.740
<v 7>Hey Jocko.
Thanks for being here.
Um,</v>

1842
02:12:23.860 --> 02:12:28.630
I've been in the army for three years now and for the past year I've been

1843
02:12:28.660 --> 02:12:33.190
thinking about putting in a packet for special forces selection.
Um,

1844
02:12:33.250 --> 02:12:36.790
so I guess I just wanted to ask you to talk a little bit about,
uh,

1845
02:12:37.360 --> 02:12:41.680
when you joined the seal teams and what did you do to physically and mentally

1846
02:12:41.681 --> 02:12:46.330
prepare yourself?
And,
and generally why did you,
why did you decide to join?

1847
02:12:47.090 --> 02:12:47.923
<v 4>Okay,</v>

1848
02:12:48.090 --> 02:12:52.410
<v 5>man,
I wanted to do that since I was a little kid.
When I heard that,</v>

1849
02:12:52.710 --> 02:12:54.630
I heard that the seals,
one of the toughest training,

1850
02:12:54.840 --> 02:12:59.070
and that's not necessarily true thing.

1851
02:12:59.220 --> 02:13:02.670
All the training is hard.
There's this special forces,

1852
02:13:02.970 --> 02:13:06.750
the mar soc units,
the Raiders,
the Air Force,

1853
02:13:06.751 --> 02:13:09.060
PJ's and CCC is it?
It's,

1854
02:13:09.120 --> 02:13:14.120
everyone's got their awesome special operations units and the training is all

1855
02:13:14.221 --> 02:13:16.440
hard and all of them.
When I heard that the seals is the toughest training,

1856
02:13:16.441 --> 02:13:19.280
I said,
okay,
that's what I want to do.
What do you do to get ready for,

1857
02:13:19.300 --> 02:13:23.230
you know what you gotta do to get ready for it?
You,
you know,
army,
guess what?

1858
02:13:23.231 --> 02:13:25.530
You're going to be humping a rock.
You're going to be doing forced marches.

1859
02:13:25.531 --> 02:13:27.450
You gotta be able to run.
You've got to build a Nav.

1860
02:13:27.500 --> 02:13:30.600
You've got to be able to do pushups and pull ups and dips and rope climbs and

1861
02:13:30.601 --> 02:13:33.450
off scores.
What you gotta do,
you gotta train hard.

1862
02:13:34.110 --> 02:13:36.150
You got to train as hard as you possibly can,

1863
02:13:36.900 --> 02:13:41.900
and then you have to tell yourself that you're not going to quit no matter what

1864
02:13:42.721 --> 02:13:46.980
happens,
no matter what happens,
you're not going to quit.

1865
02:13:49.290 --> 02:13:49.840
<v 4>Okay?</v>

1866
02:13:49.840 --> 02:13:52.030
<v 5>No matter what happens,</v>

1867
02:13:52.480 --> 02:13:55.480
because they going to play a little psychological games on you,
like,

1868
02:13:55.510 --> 02:13:58.270
like let's say they go,
oh,
he's in good shape.
He's,
you know,

1869
02:13:58.271 --> 02:14:00.370
we can't really touch him physically.
He's in really good shape.

1870
02:14:00.400 --> 02:14:03.730
So now you know what they're gonna do.
They're gonna say,
Oh,
you know,

1871
02:14:03.731 --> 02:14:07.420
you failed this academic tests.
You're not smart.

1872
02:14:07.930 --> 02:14:09.940
You're not really smart enough.
I mean,
you seem like a good guy,

1873
02:14:09.941 --> 02:14:11.440
but you're not really smart enough.
You're the creator.

1874
02:14:11.580 --> 02:14:13.360
You're the kind of person that will get someone killed.

1875
02:14:13.560 --> 02:14:14.680
[inaudible] gonna make a mistake.

1876
02:14:14.710 --> 02:14:16.780
They're going to start attacking you psychologically.

1877
02:14:17.380 --> 02:14:20.110
Or if you're psychologically strong,
but you're physically weak,

1878
02:14:20.200 --> 02:14:21.220
they're going to be like,
hey,

1879
02:14:21.250 --> 02:14:23.800
you're the kind of person that won't be able to carry me out combat.

1880
02:14:23.830 --> 02:14:24.850
We don't want you.

1881
02:14:26.860 --> 02:14:31.570
<v 4>They're just saying that
don't quit.</v>

1882
02:14:33.910 --> 02:14:36.280
That's it.
Don't quit.

1883
02:14:37.010 --> 02:14:37.843
<v 5>Go get some.</v>

1884
02:14:42.200 --> 02:14:43.610
<v 4>All right.</v>

1885
02:14:46.480 --> 02:14:51.250
<v 5>Think one more.
Yeah,
we're looking at,
I want to have some time to hang out.</v>

1886
02:14:51.280 --> 02:14:54.880
Sign books.
We gotta be out of here by 11 so

1887
02:14:56.530 --> 02:14:59.830
we're getting close.
Go ahead man.
Front row.

1888
02:15:04.090 --> 02:15:04.923
<v 4>Okay.</v>

1889
02:15:05.420 --> 02:15:08.990
<v 5>Jacko thing for a thank you for speaking tonight.
Just a quick question.</v>

1890
02:15:09.050 --> 02:15:12.680
I work in a corporation here in New York and one of the toughest things with

1891
02:15:12.681 --> 02:15:13.580
being an analyst here,

1892
02:15:13.581 --> 02:15:17.450
he's just the fact of like when do you actually escalate or you know,
which,

1893
02:15:17.451 --> 02:15:20.900
which kind of feels like defeat but also at the same time you want to make sure

1894
02:15:20.901 --> 02:15:22.700
you loop in somebody else to know what's going on,

1895
02:15:23.270 --> 02:15:24.860
so just wanted to ask you about that.
Thank you.

1896
02:15:29.140 --> 02:15:32.920
For me,
I look at a problem.
If I think I think contain the problem,

1897
02:15:33.580 --> 02:15:35.560
then I'm going to try and contain the problem.

1898
02:15:35.800 --> 02:15:40.660
I recognize and I weighed the risk of if this is wrong,

1899
02:15:40.690 --> 02:15:44.080
what's going to happen?
Can I manage that?
Can I control it?

1900
02:15:44.081 --> 02:15:48.370
Can I absorb the impact of that?
If I can absorb the impact of it,

1901
02:15:48.550 --> 02:15:51.970
then I know it's like,
okay,
this I need to bring this up.
I need to send this up,

1902
02:15:51.971 --> 02:15:52.570
the chain of crap.

1903
02:15:52.570 --> 02:15:55.990
If it's something that I know I can absorb the impact of and I can explain

1904
02:15:55.991 --> 02:16:00.340
myself and it will be sent and it won't have been a strategic loss or a major

1905
02:16:00.341 --> 02:16:03.250
error,
then I'm going to try and hang onto it.

1906
02:16:03.790 --> 02:16:07.030
And in the beginning I'm going to be,

1907
02:16:07.120 --> 02:16:09.610
I'm going to err towards sending it up the chain of command.

1908
02:16:09.880 --> 02:16:12.940
As I start to trust myself and I get better at my job,

1909
02:16:13.000 --> 02:16:17.200
I'm going to hang on to more.
But again,
I'm always going to weigh,

1910
02:16:17.500 --> 02:16:22.240
is this something that I can contain or I can absorb if it goes wrong?

1911
02:16:23.050 --> 02:16:26.380
And if it's something that I can't,
hey,
I'm going to run it by somebody.

1912
02:16:27.310 --> 02:16:30.820
So I think it's,
you just got to weigh out and once you weigh that out,

1913
02:16:32.050 --> 02:16:34.600
make a decision and live with it.

1914
02:16:36.730 --> 02:16:39.190
All right,
got one more

1915
02:16:42.320 --> 02:16:45.650
<v 4>here.
Microphone.
Anyone.</v>

1916
02:16:49.020 --> 02:16:49.970
Was there a mic right there?

1917
02:16:55.920 --> 02:16:59.760
<v 9>Um,
as somebody who's,
uh,
recently,
uh,</v>

1918
02:17:00.030 --> 02:17:03.960
is recently proposed to somebody who would like to spend the rest of my life

1919
02:17:03.961 --> 02:17:07.720
with as somebody who's married and has a,

1920
02:17:08.190 --> 02:17:10.050
from my knowledge,
uh,

1921
02:17:10.190 --> 02:17:14.510
gone away for extensive periods of time from their partner.
Oh,

1922
02:17:14.610 --> 02:17:19.610
what is your tips to building a mortar proof marriage that's going to last a

1923
02:17:20.851 --> 02:17:21.684
long time?

1924
02:17:21.720 --> 02:17:25.070
<v 5>Yup.
The first thing I'll say is,
you know,</v>

1925
02:17:25.080 --> 02:17:28.530
you want to develop the,
you want your,

1926
02:17:28.531 --> 02:17:33.531
you want to make sure and encourage your wife to be emo.

1927
02:17:34.520 --> 02:17:36.720
I emotionally independent,

1928
02:17:37.590 --> 02:17:41.730
emotionally independent because there's going to be times when you're not around

1929
02:17:42.360 --> 02:17:46.620
and if they're dependent on you emotionally,
you're not there.

1930
02:17:46.621 --> 02:17:50.370
They're gonna,
they're gonna be hurt and they're not gonna be able to handle it.

1931
02:17:50.520 --> 02:17:55.520
So you want to help them build that resiliency where when you're not around,

1932
02:17:57.060 --> 02:17:59.460
they know how to handle things independently,

1933
02:17:59.461 --> 02:18:03.650
like the broken water heater and the flat tire that they can do that.
And you,

1934
02:18:03.651 --> 02:18:07.380
you go through those things,
you,
you build that confidence with that.

1935
02:18:07.980 --> 02:18:12.980
And then also the emotional independence where what they have is trust in you

1936
02:18:14.910 --> 02:18:16.020
that you're gone,

1937
02:18:16.021 --> 02:18:20.910
but you're coming back and you're going to be there for them.
Always.

1938
02:18:21.060 --> 02:18:21.990
That's number one.

1939
02:18:23.070 --> 02:18:28.070
Number two is straight up extreme ownership.

1940
02:18:29.970 --> 02:18:30.803
That's what it is.

1941
02:18:31.200 --> 02:18:35.460
When something is going wrong in your marriage,

1942
02:18:36.150 --> 02:18:39.750
it's your fault.
It's your fault.

1943
02:18:40.290 --> 02:18:44.460
The minute you turned your wife and you say you shouldn't have done this,

1944
02:18:45.510 --> 02:18:47.120
you're wrong,
and you're,

1945
02:18:47.121 --> 02:18:49.830
you're taking that relationship in the wrong direction when you say,
Hey,
look,

1946
02:18:49.831 --> 02:18:54.480
I'm trying to figure out how I made you do what you did.

1947
02:18:54.600 --> 02:18:55.860
I don't want to let that happen.

1948
02:18:57.180 --> 02:19:01.680
So taking ownership when things go wrong,
that's what you gotta do.

1949
02:19:02.700 --> 02:19:05.580
That's what you gotta do.
Thank you.
Awesome.

1950
02:19:07.460 --> 02:19:07.940
<v 4>Awesome.</v>

1951
02:19:07.940 --> 02:19:12.940
[inaudible]

1952
02:19:17.510 --> 02:19:21.890
<v 5>with that.
Um,
once again,</v>

1953
02:19:22.310 --> 02:19:27.310
I can't thank you all enough for coming tonight and I know that you're just not

1954
02:19:28.371 --> 02:19:32.570
here tonight.
I know that if you're here tonight,
you're here all the time.

1955
02:19:32.690 --> 02:19:34.490
You're with us,
you're supporting us,

1956
02:19:34.491 --> 02:19:37.410
you're supporting everything that we're doing.
You're supporting the,

1957
02:19:37.540 --> 02:19:40.310
you're representing,
representing,

1958
02:19:40.340 --> 02:19:44.690
representing with the store,
with the Jacqueline store,
with the,

1959
02:19:44.780 --> 02:19:48.440
with the origin.
You're,
you guys are in the game,
you're getting the books and,

1960
02:19:48.560 --> 02:19:51.040
and most important you're,

1961
02:19:51.041 --> 02:19:54.620
you're listening and you're with us.
And

1962
02:19:57.320 --> 02:20:01.400
the podcast a,
it's a lot of work.

1963
02:20:02.230 --> 02:20:05.240
There's a lot of work,
a lot of work goes into it.

1964
02:20:07.340 --> 02:20:12.340
But I get more out of it than anyone.

1965
02:20:13.670 --> 02:20:16.670
I get more out of doing this than anyone.

1966
02:20:17.990 --> 02:20:22.990
And the thing that drives me to keep doing this is not just what I get out of

1967
02:20:23.961 --> 02:20:24.794
it,

1968
02:20:24.910 --> 02:20:29.620
but also that you all are there and

1969
02:20:31.350 --> 02:20:36.350
that you all are listening and that you all are sitting there with us and that

1970
02:20:39.601 --> 02:20:43.620
you guys are hearing the same thing that I'm hearing and you're learning the

1971
02:20:43.621 --> 02:20:46.410
same things that I'm learning

1972
02:20:50.620 --> 02:20:54.160
and I know that we're together.

1973
02:20:56.380 --> 02:21:00.160
And I know that
that sounds kind of weird.

1974
02:21:00.161 --> 02:21:03.010
That sounds kind of crazy.
But

1975
02:21:04.660 --> 02:21:08.170
we are where together we're hanging out,

1976
02:21:09.370 --> 02:21:13.150
we're moving forward and

1977
02:21:15.580 --> 02:21:19.790
together
we're stronger.

1978
02:21:23.510 --> 02:21:28.510
And even though we aren't strong enough to bring back days

1979
02:21:31.900 --> 02:21:34.870
and even though we aren't strong enough

1980
02:21:37.930 --> 02:21:39.520
to bring back the sunset,

1981
02:21:44.250 --> 02:21:45.380
at least,

1982
02:21:46.590 --> 02:21:47.150
<v 0>yeah,</v>

1983
02:21:47.150 --> 02:21:49.130
<v 5>we can sit here together</v>

1984
02:21:52.520 --> 02:21:56.600
and we can be humbled and mystified by this life.

1985
02:21:59.980 --> 02:22:00.850
And together

1986
02:22:03.910 --> 02:22:08.240
we can go out
and we can live it.

1987
02:22:11.810 --> 02:22:14.750
I think that's all we've got for tonight.

1988
02:22:16.180 --> 02:22:19.580
So thanks for coming down.
And until next time,

1989
02:22:20.480 --> 02:22:24.350
this is echo and Jocko out.

1990
02:22:25.030 --> 02:22:30.030
<v 0>[inaudible].</v>
