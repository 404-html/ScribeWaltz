00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:06.350
This is episode one of the Warrior Kid podcast.

2
00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:12.270
Ask Uncle Jake.
Good Morning Eco.

3
00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.860
Good morning.
And we're putting that together,

4
00:00:16.861 --> 00:00:20.490
this podcast for kids.

5
00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.430
This is a podcast for kids specifically.

6
00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.040
This is a podcast for warrior kids,
uh,

7
00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.720
based on the book,
the way of the warrior kid.

8
00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.390
And we're going to talk about that book and basically answer a bunch of

9
00:00:36.391 --> 00:00:40.530
questions that a bunch of kids asked.
So first of all,
really quickly,

10
00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.480
if you don't know anything about the warrior kid,
don't know who uncle Jake is,

11
00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.720
don't know who I am and don't know who echo is really quickly.

12
00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:50.580
My name is Jocko Willink.

13
00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.640
I was born and raised in a little new England town on a dirt road and I joined

14
00:00:57.631 --> 00:01:01.890
the navy when I was 18 years old and I went into the seal teams and I stayed in

15
00:01:01.891 --> 00:01:05.940
the seal teams for 20 years.
I had a great time.
I love my job.

16
00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.230
I worked with a bunch of great people,
people that were in the seal teams,

17
00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.140
people in the army,
people in the navy,

18
00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.330
people in the air force and the Marine Corps.

19
00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:21.800
I fought in the war in Iraq and it was an honor to be there with so many brave

20
00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:28.260
men and women.
And I eventually retired from the navy.

21
00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.860
And now I have a business where I teach people about leadership and I live out

22
00:01:35.881 --> 00:01:40.881
here in California and I have four kids in my own now,

23
00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.890
uncle Jake,
he's one of the characters in the book way,
the Warrior Kid.

24
00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.810
And a lot of people think uncle Jake is me.
But that is actually not true.

25
00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.910
Uncle Jake is a fictional character,

26
00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:58.770
which means he isn't real and it,

27
00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:03.540
but even though he's not real in real life,
he's real in my head.

28
00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:05.310
So when I wrote about him,

29
00:02:05.311 --> 00:02:10.311
it was very easy for me to write about him because I kind of knew what he was

30
00:02:10.981 --> 00:02:11.490
like.

31
00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:16.490
He's uncle Jake is kind of the seal that I always tried to be uncle Jake's

32
00:02:16.681 --> 00:02:20.490
better than me.
He's the the ideal seal,

33
00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:26.540
meaning that he has the characteristics that I think the best seal would be

34
00:02:28.411 --> 00:02:32.400
like.
And I was certainly not the best seal.
I tried my best,

35
00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:37.740
but it's a hard job.
And even though I don't know,

36
00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:43.050
even though I'm not quite as good as uncle Jake is in many respects in many

37
00:02:43.741 --> 00:02:44.820
respects,
not even close.

38
00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:49.410
But I do know how he thinks and that's why I think I'll be able to answer some

39
00:02:49.411 --> 00:02:53.880
of the questions that people had for uncle Jake.
And then lastly,

40
00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:55.200
Echo Charles.

41
00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:01.160
He is a friend of mine from Jujitsu who is really good with computers and video

42
00:03:01.811 --> 00:03:05.800
cameras and voice recorders and he helps make all these podcasts.

43
00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:10.830
And the reason that we know each other is from training Jujitsu,

44
00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:15.280
which has been trending for a long time and Jujitsu and that's how we know each

45
00:03:15.281 --> 00:03:19.270
other.
And he has two little warrior kids of his own.
How old are they?

46
00:03:19.271 --> 00:03:24.250
Echo currently?
Nine months.
And for years,
you know,
little kids,

47
00:03:24.251 --> 00:03:25.300
one girl and one boy.

48
00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:30.330
I have three girls and one boy and my oldest girl is about to graduate from high

49
00:03:32.591 --> 00:03:37.591
school and my youngest daughter is in second grade.

50
00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:42.280
So that's my,
that's who I am.
And like I said,

51
00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:47.370
this is a podcast for kids and you all sent a bunch of questions and I

52
00:03:48.131 --> 00:03:51.490
definitely appreciate it.
I appreciate that you all,

53
00:03:51.491 --> 00:03:56.170
you kids put pictures of yourselves doing a bunch of things that are good for

54
00:03:56.171 --> 00:04:00.820
you.
Reading a book,
which is awesome.
You sent pictures of you doing pull ups,

55
00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:05.770
doing pushups,
studying,
making times tables,

56
00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:07.090
all those things and,

57
00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:12.120
and I really enjoyed seeing all these kids doing all those things that are good.

58
00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:17.290
A lot of times you hear about kids doing things that are bad and that this was a

59
00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:19.960
complete opposite of that kid's doing things that were good.

60
00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:24.520
So I got a bunch of questions and I'm going to just try and answer them as quick

61
00:04:24.521 --> 00:04:28.780
as I can.
Thank you for asking them.
So here we go.

62
00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:30.040
I'm going to get right into it.

63
00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:35.260
Nathan wanted to know when the next war your kid's book is coming.

64
00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:38.680
It's coming in May of 2018

65
00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:45.360
benedict wanted to know how many books I have and how many I've read already.

66
00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:50.140
I have a lot of books.
I don't know the number,
but I have a lot of books.

67
00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:53.830
I read books all the time and when I went to college,

68
00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:58.030
I actually studied English,
which means I read even more books.

69
00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:01.540
I didn't keep all those books.
I kept some of them,
the ones that I liked,

70
00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:05.740
I kept the ones that I didn't like.
I got rid of him.
And,

71
00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:11.260
but right now I would say I have a few hundred books and I've read probably a

72
00:05:11.261 --> 00:05:15.880
little bit,
well probably around half of them.
Some of them I only referred to.

73
00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:19.990
But yeah,
the more you read,
the smarter you get.
So keep reading.

74
00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:24.010
Next,
how does a seven year old deal with bullying,

75
00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:27.310
physical bullying and being left out of groups?

76
00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:31.780
So this is the best way I think you'd deal with bullying.

77
00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:37.900
Do pullups that's one thing.
Do Jujitsu,
study,
learn,

78
00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:42.550
read.
And with all those things,
the better you get at those things,

79
00:05:42.551 --> 00:05:45.370
the more confident you'll be,
then the more confident you are,

80
00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:48.430
the less bullying occurs.
Now,
sometimes you're gonna get bullied.

81
00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:53.140
Everybody's going to get bullied.
I got bullied when I was a kid.
It happens.

82
00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:57.260
There's always,
and I and I even see adults that get bullied,
eve,

83
00:05:57.261 --> 00:05:58.850
it's not quite the same,

84
00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:04.240
but some people have a boss that's a bully or they're in a relationship with a

85
00:06:04.431 --> 00:06:07.520
girlfriend or a boyfriend or a husband and wife and they can be bullies.

86
00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:12.110
So bullying happens all the time and you,
you got to learn to deal with it.

87
00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:16.430
But some of the best things you can do is try and make yourself better by

88
00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:19.640
working out,
by studying,
by learning.

89
00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:24.770
And those things will help you gain confidence.
And when you gain confidence,

90
00:06:24.771 --> 00:06:27.500
there's less bullying.
Now as far as being left out of groups,

91
00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:31.400
that's not that big of a deal because you know what?

92
00:06:31.401 --> 00:06:32.660
It's okay to be alone sometimes.

93
00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:36.170
And if there's some people that are out there that don't want to hang around

94
00:06:36.171 --> 00:06:38.570
with,
you,
find some other people to hang around with.

95
00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:40.040
And if there's no one to hang around with,

96
00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:43.910
that's okay to go hang around with a book,
go hang around with a pullup bar.

97
00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:47.870
That's okay.
It's not always fun,

98
00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:50.390
but sometimes that's the way it has to be.

99
00:06:50.391 --> 00:06:53.540
Sometimes there's no kids around that are interested in the same things as you,

100
00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:58.550
so that's no big deal.
All right,
next question.

101
00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:03.380
Do you get a lot of alleys,
uncle Jake?
Well,
yes,

102
00:07:03.381 --> 00:07:08.060
I do get some alley sometimes.
Well,
uncle Jake rarely gets hurt.
Jocko.

103
00:07:08.090 --> 00:07:12.110
Me,
I get hurt sometimes.
Right now I have a broken knuckle,

104
00:07:12.470 --> 00:07:15.440
which is bothering me.
I cut my foot last night for no reason,

105
00:07:15.441 --> 00:07:19.850
which is bothering me and I have tweaked me.
That's what's going on with,

106
00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:23.210
with Jocko right now.
Uncle Jake gets hurt a little less than Jocko,

107
00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:25.220
but everyone get hurt.
Everyone's a human.

108
00:07:26.150 --> 00:07:30.860
And who taught uncle Jake to be a war?
Your kid when he was four years old.

109
00:07:30.861 --> 00:07:32.240
And those questions are from Zacky.

110
00:07:33.650 --> 00:07:36.200
We're going to get into into uncle Jake and how he grew up.

111
00:07:36.230 --> 00:07:39.800
But uncle Jake wasn't born a warrior.

112
00:07:40.010 --> 00:07:43.480
He wasn't born a warrior kid.
He had to become a warrior kidney,

113
00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:44.810
kind of talks about that in the book.

114
00:07:45.010 --> 00:07:47.480
He couldn't do a bunch of pushups before he joined the military.

115
00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:51.320
He couldn't do a bunch of punks.
He had to learn.
He didn't know to be smart.

116
00:07:51.350 --> 00:07:52.880
He had to learn how to study.

117
00:07:53.420 --> 00:07:57.590
So we'll talk about that and some of the future warrior kid books.

118
00:07:59.740 --> 00:08:00.573
<v 1>Next up,</v>

119
00:08:02.570 --> 00:08:07.070
<v 0>how often could you have a treat without falling for the sugarcoated lies?</v>

120
00:08:07.071 --> 00:08:08.270
And that's from Durham,

121
00:08:08.271 --> 00:08:13.070
age 11 sometimes you can have treats for sure and you just have to make sure

122
00:08:13.071 --> 00:08:16.760
that you're not going overboard and going crazy with the snickers bars.

123
00:08:16.761 --> 00:08:21.761
And the Cheetos Echo knows that that I eat Cheetos sometimes.

124
00:08:22.390 --> 00:08:27.080
Yes,
they have bags of Cheetos in our,
in our office where we record this.

125
00:08:27.220 --> 00:08:31.940
And so sometimes I grab a bag of Cheetos and the thing is you just gotta be

126
00:08:31.941 --> 00:08:34.280
careful that you don't go overboard with stuff.

127
00:08:34.310 --> 00:08:36.440
So if you want to have an occasional,
make sure they earn it.

128
00:08:36.470 --> 00:08:38.510
That's one thing I like to do is I like to make sure that I earn it,

129
00:08:38.780 --> 00:08:42.800
meaning I'm going to work out hard before I delve into the sugarcoated lies.

130
00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:47.050
Just be careful.
Good way to look at that.
And Holly,

131
00:08:47.060 --> 00:08:52.060
go over it with my daughter is things like Cheetos and m and m's and all these

132
00:08:52.851 --> 00:08:57.380
things.
They,
you weak other
fruits make you strong.

133
00:08:57.381 --> 00:09:01.160
So yeah,
if you eat a bunch of strong foods,
if you had some Cheetos,

134
00:09:01.161 --> 00:09:03.560
sure it's gonna make you weaker,
but you'll still be strong overall.

135
00:09:03.860 --> 00:09:08.540
So it gives them an idea,
you know,
of like eating a bunch of strong food,

136
00:09:08.541 --> 00:09:12.410
you're still gonna maintain that strongness.
Right,
right.
And then,
okay,

137
00:09:12.411 --> 00:09:14.000
so every once in a while you can have some weak foods,

138
00:09:14.001 --> 00:09:15.830
but you'll still be strong.
The more weak foods you have,

139
00:09:15.831 --> 00:09:17.060
the weaker you're going to get.
Yes.

140
00:09:17.061 --> 00:09:20.420
And you don't want to let the weak foods be more than the strong foods because

141
00:09:20.421 --> 00:09:24.200
then you're going to be weak instead of being strong or even even because you

142
00:09:24.201 --> 00:09:25.160
eat a bunch of strong foods,

143
00:09:25.161 --> 00:09:27.230
you get all strong and then you eat a bunch of weak foods,

144
00:09:27.231 --> 00:09:30.320
then now you're back to zero.
Yeah.
We don't want to be zero.
No,
we don't.

145
00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:34.760
All right.
Levi at sent a video question that was pretty funny.
Uh,

146
00:09:34.910 --> 00:09:36.860
and a good question.
How many pull ups,
push ups,
sit ups,

147
00:09:36.861 --> 00:09:40.160
burpees should I be able to do by the end of summer?
And I had asked him back,

148
00:09:40.161 --> 00:09:42.680
how many can you do right now?
And he said he could do five pull ups,

149
00:09:42.681 --> 00:09:46.040
14 four 36 setups.
And he didn't know how many burpees.

150
00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:50.770
And so I answered him back and said he should try for 12 pullups 35 pushups,

151
00:09:50.780 --> 00:09:55.160
60 setups and 30 burpees into minutes.
And he said,

152
00:09:55.161 --> 00:09:56.900
thanks for helping with this exercises.

153
00:09:57.290 --> 00:10:00.680
So that's something that every one's going to want to know is how many should I

154
00:10:00.681 --> 00:10:02.270
be able to do?
Well,

155
00:10:02.271 --> 00:10:05.990
it's as many as you can and you're always working to try and get one more.

156
00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:07.011
That's what I'm always doing.

157
00:10:07.011 --> 00:10:11.570
So if you can do for hopefully next week you can do five.
Once you can do five,

158
00:10:11.660 --> 00:10:13.670
hopefully the week after that you can do six new.

159
00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:15.200
You're always trying to build and get stronger.

160
00:10:15.530 --> 00:10:18.110
And what's really nice about being a kid is it's a,

161
00:10:18.111 --> 00:10:21.530
you're able to keep getting stronger and stronger and stronger for years and

162
00:10:21.531 --> 00:10:24.890
years and years.
Once you're an old man like me,

163
00:10:26.180 --> 00:10:29.240
then it's harder to make those gains.
Yeah.
But that's okay.

164
00:10:29.660 --> 00:10:33.380
We still keep working cause otherwise we start going backwards.
Yeah.

165
00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:38.030
And we don't want to do that.
No.
Next One from Colin,
I'm 14,

166
00:10:38.031 --> 00:10:39.440
so I guess I'm still considered a kid.

167
00:10:39.830 --> 00:10:43.070
Loved to know what would happen if you ever took a day off from your routine.

168
00:10:44.150 --> 00:10:47.030
I guess he means by my routine,
it's working out and getting up early.

169
00:10:47.330 --> 00:10:48.500
And if that happened,
you know,

170
00:10:48.530 --> 00:10:50.780
I would just have to get back on the routine the next day.

171
00:10:51.230 --> 00:10:55.580
And I think what you have to watch out for is you take a day off.

172
00:10:55.910 --> 00:10:56.120
<v 2>Okay.</v>

173
00:10:56.120 --> 00:10:59.150
<v 0>And then that turns into two days off and then that turns into a week and then</v>

174
00:10:59.151 --> 00:11:01.040
that turns into a month.
And then the next thing you know,

175
00:11:01.790 --> 00:11:04.370
you've been off your routine and you're getting,
you're not getting stronger,

176
00:11:04.371 --> 00:11:08.210
you're getting weaker,
you're not getting smarter,
you're getting dumber.

177
00:11:09.050 --> 00:11:13.850
You don't want that.
Uh,
you beat next one.
You beat the sun up every morning.

178
00:11:13.851 --> 00:11:15.020
What time do you go to sleep?

179
00:11:16.500 --> 00:11:21.030
And how important is rest and nutrition to a warrior kid?
Rest and nutrition.

180
00:11:21.031 --> 00:11:24.090
Nutritionist really important.
And you should sleep all lot.

181
00:11:24.570 --> 00:11:27.300
That's what makes you recover.
That's what helps you grow,

182
00:11:27.301 --> 00:11:31.260
especially kids that are still growing.
You need to get as much sleep as you can,

183
00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:35.130
so go to bed.
I'll tell you when you go to bed,
go to bed when you feel tired.

184
00:11:35.460 --> 00:11:37.170
And a lot of times this these days,

185
00:11:37.290 --> 00:11:41.310
that means putting away the iPhone and the iPad and stuff that keeps you awake

186
00:11:41.311 --> 00:11:43.890
for no reason.
Put those things away and go to sleep.

187
00:11:43.891 --> 00:11:48.270
Cause when you're going to sleep,
you're getting stronger.
Next one,

188
00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:52.860
my little warrior wants to know if all kids have to train Brazilian Jujitsu.

189
00:11:52.890 --> 00:11:56.890
Are there other options?
She's in another sport for 10 hours a week.

190
00:11:57.670 --> 00:11:59.500
While the most important thing,
and that's great,

191
00:11:59.530 --> 00:12:02.920
is that she's training and she's training hard and there's all kinds of sports

192
00:12:02.921 --> 00:12:07.150
in all sports are good for you and it's good to train hard and sports and it's

193
00:12:07.151 --> 00:12:12.151
good to focus on sports so you don't have to train Jujitsu to be a warrior.

194
00:12:14.110 --> 00:12:16.840
That being said,
if you get the chance,

195
00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:19.270
try and take a little Jujitsu and I'll tell you why.

196
00:12:19.420 --> 00:12:24.420
Because one thing that Jujitsu will give you that other sports won't give you as

197
00:12:24.581 --> 00:12:28.780
the means to defend yourself and stand up for yourself if someone's picking on

198
00:12:28.781 --> 00:12:31.330
you or bullying you.
So it is important to train Jujitsu,

199
00:12:31.540 --> 00:12:33.460
but if you're training really hard and other athletics,

200
00:12:33.461 --> 00:12:36.850
you might not be able to do as much as you want.
Um,
but that's okay.

201
00:12:37.180 --> 00:12:40.750
Just try and squeeze in a little bit so you know how to take care of yourself

202
00:12:40.751 --> 00:12:44.770
and defend yourself.
Good for autonomy as well.
So like if you play team sports,

203
00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:47.920
it,
there is this element,
this is a good thing by the way,
that we're,

204
00:12:48.460 --> 00:12:50.110
people are depending on you to do your job.

205
00:12:50.111 --> 00:12:51.740
You're depending on other people to do their jobs.

206
00:12:51.741 --> 00:12:54.790
So you can collectively win in Jujitsu or track,

207
00:12:55.060 --> 00:12:57.280
which there's a small element of that.

208
00:12:57.460 --> 00:13:02.440
But mainly it's the,
it's you,
you,
you have to go in,

209
00:13:02.441 --> 00:13:06.310
you have to take it upon yourself to get the job done for you.
And it's,

210
00:13:06.340 --> 00:13:08.590
it's essentially all all I knew.
And you learn that.

211
00:13:09.130 --> 00:13:11.530
So if you play team sports the whole time,
you get less of that.

212
00:13:11.560 --> 00:13:14.110
You have a law there.
Is that in team sports?
For sure,

213
00:13:14.350 --> 00:13:18.520
but it's more prevalent than the Jujitsu or wrestling or track something where

214
00:13:18.521 --> 00:13:21.520
you're,
it's just you,
just to you.
Yeah,
those are,
those are good sports.

215
00:13:21.521 --> 00:13:25.210
Very intense,
very intense sports.
And you,
like I said,

216
00:13:25.211 --> 00:13:28.210
you learn how to defend yourself.
Next one.

217
00:13:28.211 --> 00:13:30.400
Bennett from Michigan wants to know Uncle Jake.

218
00:13:30.460 --> 00:13:33.220
Why did you want to be a navy seal?
Well,

219
00:13:33.221 --> 00:13:36.760
Uncle Jake always wanted to be some kind of commando ever since he was a little

220
00:13:36.761 --> 00:13:40.900
kid and as soon as he figured out what the seal teams were,

221
00:13:41.290 --> 00:13:46.210
that's what he,
that's what he decided to go for.
Next one.
Uncle Jake,

222
00:13:46.211 --> 00:13:49.450
my son Mccoy wants to know when you will have your own TV show.

223
00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:51.553
I don't know.

224
00:13:51.860 --> 00:13:56.660
But we do have right now the first warrior kid podcast,

225
00:13:57.200 --> 00:13:59.600
so we'll see what happens with the TV show.

226
00:14:01.410 --> 00:14:06.410
I would rather have a bunch of kids reading books rather than watching a TV show

227
00:14:08.780 --> 00:14:09.440
next.

228
00:14:09.440 --> 00:14:14.000
Anderson turns eight today and asks what would win karate or Jujitsu

229
00:14:16.470 --> 00:14:18.750
and the answer to that question is Jujitsu.

230
00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:21.750
Actually that's been gone over a bunch of times now.

231
00:14:21.751 --> 00:14:23.670
There's a bunch of good stuff you get from karate to,

232
00:14:23.970 --> 00:14:25.740
you learned a lot about discipline and karate.

233
00:14:25.860 --> 00:14:29.130
You learn some good striking in karate,
so that's good too.

234
00:14:30.180 --> 00:14:34.390
But if he can try and train some Jujitsu as well so that you learned some

235
00:14:34.391 --> 00:14:35.080
grappling.

236
00:14:35.080 --> 00:14:39.700
It's a different type of fighting and when you put pure striking,

237
00:14:39.730 --> 00:14:42.670
which is punching and kicking each other against pure grappling,

238
00:14:42.820 --> 00:14:47.280
most of the time it's the grappler that wins.
Next one.

239
00:14:47.850 --> 00:14:50.160
How do you be a warrior?
Well,

240
00:14:51.090 --> 00:14:56.090
talk about that a lot in the way of the warrior kid book and Uncle Jake explains

241
00:14:57.590 --> 00:15:02.570
too.
He explains to mark exactly.

242
00:15:02.780 --> 00:15:07.610
Well,
kind of not exactly,
but he explains to them what a war your kid is.
Any,

243
00:15:07.611 --> 00:15:11.990
any explains to him in a pretty good paragraph.
I just opened up the book.

244
00:15:12.380 --> 00:15:16.910
Here's what,
here's what a warrior kid is.
A normal kid doesn't push himself.

245
00:15:16.911 --> 00:15:17.990
A warrior kid does.

246
00:15:18.020 --> 00:15:21.350
A normal kid doesn't work constantly trying to improve himself.

247
00:15:21.410 --> 00:15:26.060
A warrior kid does all these problems that you cried about yesterday,
mark,

248
00:15:26.180 --> 00:15:28.700
a warrior kid wouldn't cry about those problems.

249
00:15:28.850 --> 00:15:31.970
A warrior kid would do something about those problems.

250
00:15:32.900 --> 00:15:36.490
So those are some of the things that a warrior kid does also.

251
00:15:36.760 --> 00:15:41.760
And if you read though the code that Mark writes at the end of the book of what

252
00:15:43.431 --> 00:15:45.500
it's like to be a warrior and his,

253
00:15:45.560 --> 00:15:48.710
he makes his own warrior kid code that he's going to live by,

254
00:15:48.711 --> 00:15:50.150
that the rules that he's going to have.

255
00:15:50.450 --> 00:15:54.080
And those are very good rules to be a warrior.
And I think,

256
00:15:54.290 --> 00:15:58.070
I think mark did a great job of of coming up with those rules and I'll tell you

257
00:15:58.071 --> 00:16:01.700
what they are.
Number one,
the warrior kid wakes up early in the morning.

258
00:16:02.210 --> 00:16:03.043
Number two,

259
00:16:03.050 --> 00:16:07.520
the warrior kids studies to learn and gain knowledge and asks questions if he

260
00:16:07.521 --> 00:16:09.800
doesn't understand.
Number three,

261
00:16:09.920 --> 00:16:14.920
the warrior kid trains hard exercises and eats right to be strong and fast and

262
00:16:15.231 --> 00:16:16.064
healthy.

263
00:16:16.310 --> 00:16:20.090
Number for the warrior kid trains know how to fight so he can stand up to

264
00:16:20.091 --> 00:16:21.920
bullies and protect the week.

265
00:16:22.520 --> 00:16:27.080
Number five the warrior kid treats people with respect and helps out other

266
00:16:27.081 --> 00:16:30.050
people whenever possible.
Number six,

267
00:16:30.170 --> 00:16:34.850
the warrior kid keeps things neat and is always prepared and ready for action.

268
00:16:35.510 --> 00:16:39.350
Number seven,
the warrior kid stays humble.
Number Eight,

269
00:16:39.560 --> 00:16:44.150
the warrior kid works hard and always does his best.

270
00:16:45.290 --> 00:16:48.890
Number nine I am the warrior kit,
so

271
00:16:50.410 --> 00:16:52.690
<v 1>that's what</v>

272
00:16:53.220 --> 00:16:57.240
<v 0>being a warrior is,
especially for a kid.
Next,</v>

273
00:16:58.200 --> 00:17:00.570
hi Uncle Jake.
My name is Chris.
I'm eight years old.

274
00:17:00.571 --> 00:17:02.880
I go to Jujitsu class every week.
How can I get better?

275
00:17:03.030 --> 00:17:05.730
The bigger kids always beat me.
Well,

276
00:17:05.731 --> 00:17:07.380
that's what happens in the beginning of Jujitsu.

277
00:17:07.650 --> 00:17:10.980
When you first start off Jujitsu,
you get beat all the time.

278
00:17:11.220 --> 00:17:14.790
It happened to me when I was starting Jujitsu and it happens to everyone.

279
00:17:14.791 --> 00:17:15.690
When they start Jujitsu,

280
00:17:15.780 --> 00:17:20.310
you get beat and the way that you get better is by keeping training,

281
00:17:20.340 --> 00:17:24.780
keep training all the time,
as much as you can,
and that's how you get better.

282
00:17:25.020 --> 00:17:29.670
And eventually what's good about Jujitsu is when you know more Jiu Jitsu than

283
00:17:29.671 --> 00:17:32.790
the other person,
you can still beat them even if they're bigger than you.

284
00:17:33.270 --> 00:17:37.350
So that's why I really liked Jujitsu.
Next,

285
00:17:37.980 --> 00:17:42.120
my son wants to know why no matter what the situation or problem mark has,

286
00:17:42.360 --> 00:17:43.860
Uncle Jake always says good.

287
00:17:46.150 --> 00:17:51.150
So the reason that uncle Jake always says good when there's a problem is because

288
00:17:53.340 --> 00:17:56.730
you always look at things in the most positive light.

289
00:17:57.330 --> 00:18:00.480
And when he sees things,
other people might see something as a problem.

290
00:18:00.510 --> 00:18:03.390
He sees that as a challenge that he can overcome.

291
00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:06.210
And that's why when he sees a problem,
he just says,
good,

292
00:18:06.510 --> 00:18:10.320
let's find a solution to that problem.
Next.
Hi Uncle Jake,

293
00:18:10.321 --> 00:18:14.490
my nephew Lincoln is a military kid.
Second grader loves your book.

294
00:18:15.210 --> 00:18:18.810
What would uncle Jake tell Lincoln about being sad when his friends move away?

295
00:18:20.410 --> 00:18:22.480
Okay,
so when your friend friends move away,

296
00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:25.750
one thing that's good is that when they're moving away all you,

297
00:18:25.751 --> 00:18:29.740
you can still talk to him,
you can write them letters,
you can write them emails.

298
00:18:29.920 --> 00:18:31.840
So it's no problem when friends move away.

299
00:18:31.930 --> 00:18:35.380
And then the other thing that's good about when friends move away is it gives

300
00:18:35.381 --> 00:18:37.120
you opportunity to make new friends.

301
00:18:37.810 --> 00:18:41.170
So go shake some hands with some new kids and get to know them

302
00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:42.993
<v 1>next.</v>

303
00:18:45.160 --> 00:18:47.290
<v 0>Would you ever consider making this book into a movie</v>

304
00:18:49.090 --> 00:18:52.240
and is there ever going to be a part two?
Yes,
there's going to be a part two

305
00:18:53.740 --> 00:18:56.080
a movie that's not for me to decide.

306
00:18:57.400 --> 00:19:00.820
I'm sure someone will want to make it into a movie can make it into a cool

307
00:19:00.821 --> 00:19:04.300
cartoon.
Maybe a cartoon.
We'll have to see.

308
00:19:05.380 --> 00:19:08.080
Rebecca asks,
what time should a nine year old get up?

309
00:19:09.280 --> 00:19:10.540
And first of all,

310
00:19:10.541 --> 00:19:13.900
you need to go to bed early enough that you get plenty of sleep and then you

311
00:19:13.901 --> 00:19:18.460
need to get up early enough in the morning that you are ready for the day.

312
00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:21.700
And if you're going to try and do some kind of exercise in the morning,

313
00:19:21.870 --> 00:19:26.080
got to get up a little bit earlier and if you need to get up and do some extra

314
00:19:26.081 --> 00:19:29.380
studying,
you got to get up a little bit earlier.
So you know,

315
00:19:29.381 --> 00:19:32.770
get up early enough that you can have a good start to the day.

316
00:19:32.800 --> 00:19:33.633
That's what you want to do

317
00:19:35.100 --> 00:19:35.933
<v 1>next.</v>

318
00:19:36.770 --> 00:19:40.220
<v 0>What is your,
what is uncle Jake's favorite gun to shoot?</v>

319
00:19:41.390 --> 00:19:44.510
Uncle Jake's favorite gun to shoot is the 50 caliber machine gun,

320
00:19:44.960 --> 00:19:49.960
which is a big heavy machine gun and it's very fun to shoot.

321
00:19:51.990 --> 00:19:56.730
Next.
Jackson from Ohio says,

322
00:19:57.330 --> 00:19:59.400
asked Uncle Jake,
how can I be a better gentleman?

323
00:19:59.910 --> 00:20:04.910
It's a great question and the answer to that is treat people how you would like

324
00:20:07.021 --> 00:20:07.854
to be treated.

325
00:20:08.790 --> 00:20:13.790
So if you follow that rule and that basically boils down to a word that we use

326
00:20:15.181 --> 00:20:18.420
called respect.
You treat people with respect.
In other words,

327
00:20:18.421 --> 00:20:20.490
you treat them how you would like to be treated.

328
00:20:21.150 --> 00:20:24.390
That's a great way to be on the path to becoming a better gentlemen.

329
00:20:26.550 --> 00:20:27.383
<v 1>Next,</v>

330
00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:34.000
<v 0>would uncle Jake have treated the kid the same if mark was a girl or would he</v>

331
00:20:35.121 --> 00:20:37.520
have led up?
Well,

332
00:20:37.521 --> 00:20:40.340
the answer to that is uncle Jake would've done the same

333
00:20:42.020 --> 00:20:46.460
treated if mark was a girl and her name was Marsha instead of mark,

334
00:20:46.900 --> 00:20:51.280
Uncle Jake.
What has done the same thing taught Marsha how to do pull ups.

335
00:20:51.460 --> 00:20:54.940
Top Marsha,
how to study taught Masha how to defend herself.

336
00:20:55.090 --> 00:20:57.400
All the problems that mark has in the book are the same.

337
00:20:57.460 --> 00:21:01.090
I have three girls that as as kids,
three girls and one boy,

338
00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:03.070
they all have had the same problems.

339
00:21:03.790 --> 00:21:07.540
So uncle Jake would have done the same thing and and it says,

340
00:21:07.541 --> 00:21:09.190
would he have led up and the answer's no.

341
00:21:09.250 --> 00:21:11.380
Uncle Jake would not have led up because that wouldn't have helped her.

342
00:21:13.130 --> 00:21:13.800
<v 3>Okay,</v>

343
00:21:13.800 --> 00:21:18.540
<v 0>next I'm eating good.
But any tricks or tips to eat faster?</v>

344
00:21:19.530 --> 00:21:22.770
It's an interesting question.
In the military you learn to eat very fast.

345
00:21:23.760 --> 00:21:25.980
First of all,
there's no reason to eat faster.

346
00:21:26.030 --> 00:21:29.220
You can take your time and it's probably better to take your time when you eat.

347
00:21:29.700 --> 00:21:32.010
If you are taking too much time,

348
00:21:32.370 --> 00:21:34.590
you're probably doing something else while you're eating,
like talking.

349
00:21:35.340 --> 00:21:37.080
So stop talking and eat.

350
00:21:40.940 --> 00:21:45.860
My daughters asked if mark in the book is named after Mark Lee.
Yes.

351
00:21:46.100 --> 00:21:51.100
Mark Lee was a seal that was worked with me in Iraq and he was killed in Iraq

352
00:21:53.240 --> 00:21:56.720
and yes,
mark and the book is named after Mark Lee.

353
00:21:56.721 --> 00:22:01.721
It's another way for me to make sure people remember mark

354
00:22:04.460 --> 00:22:05.293
next.

355
00:22:06.470 --> 00:22:11.470
What can a kid say if kids use too much social media to convince their words to

356
00:22:11.541 --> 00:22:13.580
limit use in their free time?

357
00:22:15.250 --> 00:22:15.870
<v 3>Well,</v>

358
00:22:15.870 --> 00:22:17.940
<v 0>if your friends are using too much social media,</v>

359
00:22:18.030 --> 00:22:21.360
I think what you want to say to him is,
hey,
let's go play some basketball.

360
00:22:22.710 --> 00:22:26.730
Let's go do some pull ups.
Let's go wrestle.
Let's go do some Jujitsu.

361
00:22:26.880 --> 00:22:28.650
Let's go find bugs in the yard.

362
00:22:29.130 --> 00:22:33.240
Let's put that computer screen away and let's go get better.

363
00:22:35.120 --> 00:22:37.640
That social media stuff is not making you a better person.

364
00:22:39.580 --> 00:22:44.580
Next nine year old girl that struggles to make friends at school and sometimes

365
00:22:46.960 --> 00:22:49.600
feels left out.
Well,
like I said earlier,

366
00:22:50.140 --> 00:22:54.820
it's hard for people to make friends and sometimes the people that are around

367
00:22:54.821 --> 00:22:59.200
aren't going to be the best friends with you and that's okay.

368
00:22:59.800 --> 00:23:02.470
I know different grades that I had,
different classes that I had.

369
00:23:02.471 --> 00:23:04.120
I didn't always have a bunch of friends in them.

370
00:23:04.270 --> 00:23:06.040
Sometimes it was hard to get along with people.

371
00:23:06.041 --> 00:23:08.910
Sometimes they were interested in things that I wasn't interested in.

372
00:23:09.340 --> 00:23:12.550
And what I would do in those times is just find something that I am interested

373
00:23:12.551 --> 00:23:16.600
in and I would go and do it.
So if you're having trouble making friends,

374
00:23:17.200 --> 00:23:19.630
go find a book,
read a book,
go look at what they're doing.

375
00:23:19.870 --> 00:23:22.330
Maybe they're playing a game that you haven't played before and you're a little

376
00:23:22.331 --> 00:23:26.260
bit shy about getting involved in it.
Don't be shy about it.
Walk over and say,

377
00:23:26.261 --> 00:23:28.870
Hey,
can someone teach me that?
Can someone helped me learn this?

378
00:23:29.260 --> 00:23:32.260
And if you open up the conversation,
if they're nice to you,

379
00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:34.210
maybe you make a new friend.
If they're not,

380
00:23:34.540 --> 00:23:38.740
try and find someone else that maybe is doing something else that you could be

381
00:23:38.741 --> 00:23:43.450
interested in.
So I think a lot of times kids,
when you're a kid,

382
00:23:43.451 --> 00:23:44.800
and I know I felt this way when I was a kid,

383
00:23:45.410 --> 00:23:49.580
you feel like you should always have people around.
And if you,
if you're alone,

384
00:23:49.730 --> 00:23:52.730
maybe it's not a good thing,
but it's okay.
It's okay to be alone.

385
00:23:53.120 --> 00:23:54.830
It's okay to spend some time by yourself.

386
00:23:54.920 --> 00:23:56.810
You don't always need friends everywhere.

387
00:23:57.440 --> 00:23:59.810
It's friends are great and it's great when you make them,

388
00:24:00.140 --> 00:24:02.900
but you can't force people to be your friends.

389
00:24:03.200 --> 00:24:08.200
So I always found it comfortable or comforting that if I was by myself,

390
00:24:08.570 --> 00:24:12.920
I was okay with it.
I don't feel bad about it.
Next,

391
00:24:14.420 --> 00:24:16.340
how can I,
this is from Benjamin.

392
00:24:17.030 --> 00:24:20.990
How can I discipline myself to work out every day and I have a lot of adults ask

393
00:24:20.991 --> 00:24:21.980
me this question too,

394
00:24:22.790 --> 00:24:25.430
and you know how you discipline yourself to work out every day.

395
00:24:26.150 --> 00:24:29.780
You discipline yourself to work out every day.
There's no magic trick.

396
00:24:29.960 --> 00:24:34.730
It's not easy.
You get up and you work out and you do it every day.

397
00:24:34.731 --> 00:24:37.400
That's how you do it.
No magic trick there.

398
00:24:40.130 --> 00:24:45.130
What kind of workout routine for mark and pull up program?

399
00:24:45.770 --> 00:24:48.620
Well,
what if you want to do Paul,
if you want to get good at pull ups,

400
00:24:48.650 --> 00:24:53.330
the best thing to do is pull ups.
You do lots of pullups.
If,

401
00:24:54.230 --> 00:24:56.990
if you have a choice between doing sprints and long runs,

402
00:24:56.991 --> 00:25:01.160
I like to do sprints more.
So all of these things,
you know,

403
00:25:01.161 --> 00:25:02.630
don't get caught up around kids.

404
00:25:02.631 --> 00:25:05.930
Don't get caught up around doing some specific program.

405
00:25:05.931 --> 00:25:07.610
That's what your parents are all concerned about.

406
00:25:07.611 --> 00:25:11.210
I want to get told the program to do what you do is you just do a bunch.

407
00:25:11.690 --> 00:25:13.430
You do eight sets.

408
00:25:13.490 --> 00:25:16.700
A set is when you get on the pull up bar and you do as many as you can do that

409
00:25:16.701 --> 00:25:20.360
eight times.
Do it 10 times,
do it four times,

410
00:25:20.600 --> 00:25:25.070
do it six times and then do as many pushups as you can and do that three or four

411
00:25:25.071 --> 00:25:29.300
times,
maybe five times.
So don't get caught up on the program.

412
00:25:29.301 --> 00:25:32.600
Just go do some stuff.
It's not that hard.
It's,
well,

413
00:25:32.601 --> 00:25:33.530
I shouldn't say it's not that hard.

414
00:25:33.800 --> 00:25:36.770
It's can be hard when you start working out and you're going to get tired and

415
00:25:36.771 --> 00:25:39.200
stuff,
and that's one of the thing that you do need to do when you get tired,

416
00:25:39.201 --> 00:25:42.110
go a little bit more.
That's what working out is.
When you get tired,

417
00:25:42.111 --> 00:25:43.790
go a little bit more.
So go.

418
00:25:43.791 --> 00:25:47.630
Do you know I like to say eight to 10 sets of pullups.

419
00:25:47.660 --> 00:25:52.160
Eight to 10 sets of pushups.
Do some squats,
do some burpees.

420
00:25:54.140 --> 00:25:56.540
One thing that's good with burpees is do as many burpees as you can in two

421
00:25:56.541 --> 00:26:00.710
minutes.
See how,
see how many you can do.
Do that.

422
00:26:00.711 --> 00:26:05.630
Do that every few days.
Maybe do that.
Do that on Tuesdays and Thursdays.

423
00:26:05.720 --> 00:26:09.940
Many burpees as you can in two minutes
on the other days.
Do some pushups.

424
00:26:09.950 --> 00:26:12.620
Do some pushups.
Next.

425
00:26:14.840 --> 00:26:16.550
What should middle school,
young men,

426
00:26:16.551 --> 00:26:21.110
ages 11 to 13 be working on to prepare to become a productive young man?
Hmm.

427
00:26:21.950 --> 00:26:26.900
Well,
these are really easy to answer.
Study,
learn,
learn as much as you can.
Work,

428
00:26:26.960 --> 00:26:30.830
work hard,
workout.
Be Nice to people,

429
00:26:31.400 --> 00:26:32.233
make friends

00:26:33.920 --> 00:26:34.753
<v 2>read.</v>

431
00:26:35.600 --> 00:26:39.380
<v 0>Those are the kinds of things you do.
The other question about social media,</v>

432
00:26:39.410 --> 00:26:41.300
that's not gonna help you become a productive young man.

433
00:26:44.730 --> 00:26:49.500
What made you know what you wanted to do in life?
So like I said earlier,

434
00:26:49.501 --> 00:26:51.480
Uncle Jake,
he always wanted to be a commando.

435
00:26:54.460 --> 00:26:59.140
Next,
my kid cares about other kids.

436
00:26:59.170 --> 00:27:02.710
Even the bullies,
he doesn't tattle but doesn't stick up for himself.

437
00:27:02.890 --> 00:27:06.160
How can he grow confidence and courage again,
people want to grow.

438
00:27:06.161 --> 00:27:09.340
Confidence and courage.
Confidence and courage don't grow on trees.

439
00:27:09.700 --> 00:27:14.050
Confidence and courage grow from work,
from working,
from working out,

440
00:27:14.140 --> 00:27:18.160
from studying,
from learning,
from participating in sports.

441
00:27:18.280 --> 00:27:20.110
That's where you get confidence and courage from.

442
00:27:21.160 --> 00:27:24.340
So try it.
All those things out.

443
00:27:25.720 --> 00:27:28.720
A four year old girl says,
how are you doing uncle Jake?

444
00:27:28.930 --> 00:27:33.550
Uncle Jake is doing really good right now.
And a six year old boy says,

445
00:27:33.551 --> 00:27:37.990
did any of your friends die in the navy?
And yes,

446
00:27:38.050 --> 00:27:41.140
Uncle Jake lost some friends,

447
00:27:41.350 --> 00:27:43.780
very close friends while he was in the seal teams.

448
00:27:43.960 --> 00:27:46.600
That's part of being in the military.
In the military,

449
00:27:46.960 --> 00:27:51.960
you're job is to fight a war and in war people die and it's very sad and very

450
00:27:53.141 --> 00:27:53.974
tragic.

451
00:27:54.310 --> 00:27:59.310
And also it's the job of the soldiers and sailors and airmen and Marines to go

452
00:28:00.101 --> 00:28:04.400
out and fight.
Next.
Uncle Jake,

453
00:28:04.401 --> 00:28:06.350
how long his uncle Jake been in the navy and the book,

454
00:28:06.680 --> 00:28:09.140
Uncle Jake has been in the navy for eight years.

455
00:28:09.320 --> 00:28:14.320
When he goes to stay at his sister's house,

456
00:28:14.810 --> 00:28:18.740
who's marksman
nine year old son or want to know if uncle Jake,

457
00:28:18.741 --> 00:28:23.570
everyone to quit during training?
No.
Uncle Jake never wanted to quit

458
00:28:25.400 --> 00:28:30.020
and a nine year old girl says,
how can I get over not doing things perfectly?

459
00:28:30.140 --> 00:28:33.380
I get so frustrated when I don't do something perfect.
Oh,

460
00:28:34.310 --> 00:28:35.390
that happens to a lot of people.

461
00:28:36.320 --> 00:28:39.650
And what you do with that is you have to

462
00:28:41.210 --> 00:28:46.210
realize that wanting things to be perfect is imperfect.

463
00:28:47.390 --> 00:28:51.650
You're not perfect if you want everything to be perfect.
And also,

464
00:28:51.920 --> 00:28:53.630
if you're trying to do everything perfect,

465
00:28:53.840 --> 00:28:57.620
you'll never get anything truly done because you can't do anything perfectly in

466
00:28:57.621 --> 00:29:02.210
the world.
So look to be looked to do a great job.

467
00:29:02.211 --> 00:29:05.090
Look to do an outstanding job.
Look to do an excellent job.

468
00:29:05.480 --> 00:29:09.260
But when you're going for perfection,
it's going to be too hard to do.

469
00:29:11.270 --> 00:29:12.103
Next.

470
00:29:15.450 --> 00:29:20.450
How does mark work on self awareness and frustration outside of Brazilian

471
00:29:20.521 --> 00:29:24.570
Jujitsu?
Well,
when you get frustrated,
you have to realize,

472
00:29:24.571 --> 00:29:27.780
you have to realize the things that you do when you start getting frustrated.

473
00:29:28.260 --> 00:29:32.820
So if you start tensing up your arms or you start gritting your teeth or you

474
00:29:32.821 --> 00:29:36.270
start getting tears in your eyes,
you have to realize what's happening.
Yo,

475
00:29:36.271 --> 00:29:38.880
those tears in your eyes or just frustration and the,

476
00:29:39.450 --> 00:29:43.740
and when you start getting all red in the face,
that's just frustrations.

477
00:29:43.741 --> 00:29:48.610
So what you have to do is realize that you're getting frustrated and then take a

478
00:29:48.611 --> 00:29:52.930
step back,
take a deep breath,
think about something else,

479
00:29:53.530 --> 00:29:58.510
relax so that you don't let that frustration take over your brain.

480
00:30:00.120 --> 00:30:00.953
<v 1>Next</v>

481
00:30:02.370 --> 00:30:05.580
<v 0>eight year old girl asks,</v>

482
00:30:05.670 --> 00:30:08.640
was Uncle Jake bullied?

483
00:30:08.730 --> 00:30:10.860
Or a wimp like mark?

484
00:30:12.550 --> 00:30:14.050
And the answer is yes.

485
00:30:15.130 --> 00:30:15.560
<v 1>Okay,</v>

486
00:30:15.560 --> 00:30:19.130
<v 0>all little kids are getting bullied.
It happens.</v>

487
00:30:19.131 --> 00:30:20.630
It happens to a well.

488
00:30:20.631 --> 00:30:23.090
It happens to just about it or maybe not every single kid in the world,

489
00:30:23.091 --> 00:30:26.270
but most kids get bullied.
Especially when you're 10 years old.

490
00:30:27.110 --> 00:30:27.831
When you're 10 years old,

491
00:30:27.831 --> 00:30:29.720
there's always going to be somebody that's bigger and stronger than you.

492
00:30:30.330 --> 00:30:32.870
And you know anyone that's 12 years old is bigger than you.

493
00:30:33.170 --> 00:30:33.891
They're stronger than you.

494
00:30:33.891 --> 00:30:36.710
There are even a lot of times smarter than you because they've learned a little

495
00:30:36.711 --> 00:30:37.544
bit more.

496
00:30:39.250 --> 00:30:40.083
<v 1>Next</v>

497
00:30:45.550 --> 00:30:50.200
<v 0>is echo gonna make any movies about mark?</v>

498
00:30:51.910 --> 00:30:54.790
He made one little short movie about mark.
I don't know.

499
00:30:54.791 --> 00:30:55.900
I don't know what's going to happen with that.

500
00:30:56.590 --> 00:30:58.720
We'll definitely make more books about mark

501
00:31:02.660 --> 00:31:06.050
every okay kid Lucas that wants to be a seal.

502
00:31:06.800 --> 00:31:11.210
Same answer you want to be a seal with.
The advice is study hard,

503
00:31:11.330 --> 00:31:15.320
work hard,
train hard,
be a good kid,

504
00:31:15.380 --> 00:31:20.090
don't get in trouble.
Do the best you can in school.
Play some sports.

505
00:31:20.900 --> 00:31:22.340
Study hard.
That's it.

506
00:31:26.160 --> 00:31:27.930
Okay.
The,

507
00:31:28.170 --> 00:31:31.400
this boy is three and a half years old and wants to take Jujitsu,

508
00:31:31.410 --> 00:31:34.440
but the school doesn't allow it until six years old.

509
00:31:35.250 --> 00:31:39.630
So the question is should he go and watch or take kid karate?

510
00:31:39.870 --> 00:31:43.890
What do you suggest?
I would say definitely let him come watch maybe once a week.

511
00:31:43.891 --> 00:31:46.530
Just let him go there and be on the mats and see what it's like.

512
00:31:46.531 --> 00:31:49.590
And then the after they've got a karate kid that if they've got a karate program

513
00:31:49.591 --> 00:31:51.810
that he can get into until he could start to Jitsu,

514
00:31:51.900 --> 00:31:54.300
I think that'd be good for him.
So what wrestling,

515
00:31:54.301 --> 00:31:56.940
a lot of times if you can find wrestling,
they start a little bit younger.

516
00:31:57.510 --> 00:32:00.240
And same thing with judo.
Maybe you can find a judo program.

517
00:32:00.270 --> 00:32:02.790
They start them a little bit younger.
I would do wrestling first,

518
00:32:02.820 --> 00:32:05.910
then judo second,
and then do those when he's younger,

519
00:32:05.911 --> 00:32:08.130
until he can get old enough for Jujitsu.

520
00:32:11.860 --> 00:32:16.750
How do you stand up to a bully?
It's all in the book way of the Warrior Kid.

521
00:32:16.930 --> 00:32:21.660
You got to train hard,
you gotta work hard,
you got to be in good shape,
you've,

522
00:32:21.880 --> 00:32:23.770
and then you got to stand your ground and guess what?

523
00:32:23.920 --> 00:32:27.930
It doesn't mean you're going to win.
You might not win.
I got beat.

524
00:32:28.100 --> 00:32:32.890
I know this is Jocko.
Jocko got beat up when we're not that.
I got my first fight,

525
00:32:32.920 --> 00:32:37.060
I got beat and I got put in a headlock,
taken down to the ground.

526
00:32:37.061 --> 00:32:41.330
I think I was in fourth grade and taken down to the ground,

527
00:32:41.331 --> 00:32:42.680
held in the headlock and punched in the head.

528
00:32:43.370 --> 00:32:47.030
Luckily it didn't last too long because the teachers were,
were pretty close.

529
00:32:47.450 --> 00:32:52.450
So I stood up to the bully and I got taken down and put in a headlock and

530
00:32:53.391 --> 00:32:55.370
punched in the head.
You know what though?

531
00:32:56.030 --> 00:32:58.640
I didn't die and I felt good about it.

532
00:32:58.910 --> 00:33:00.470
I was okay with getting punched in the head.

533
00:33:01.160 --> 00:33:04.880
And a lot of times bullies,
you know,

534
00:33:04.881 --> 00:33:07.160
just like in the book bullies,

535
00:33:07.280 --> 00:33:11.540
the reason they're a bully is because they're mean and,

536
00:33:11.720 --> 00:33:14.360
but no one ever challenges them.
So once they get challenged,

537
00:33:14.361 --> 00:33:15.740
a lot of times they will back down.

538
00:33:18.580 --> 00:33:21.610
Can you teach me to face my fears?
Well,
again,

539
00:33:21.670 --> 00:33:23.020
we have things that we're afraid of.

540
00:33:23.021 --> 00:33:24.640
We're afraid of them because we don't understand them.

541
00:33:24.940 --> 00:33:26.650
So prepare as much as you can,

542
00:33:26.920 --> 00:33:29.980
do as much as you can to get ready for that thing that you fear.

543
00:33:31.480 --> 00:33:32.710
And then when you've practiced,

544
00:33:32.711 --> 00:33:36.410
the thing that you fear the final step you have to do just like in the book

545
00:33:36.411 --> 00:33:39.220
because you have to step.
You have to,
you have to go for it.

546
00:33:39.700 --> 00:33:40.960
That's what you eventually have to do.

547
00:33:41.920 --> 00:33:45.130
Can you teach me how to recognize things that aren't good like poison ivy and

548
00:33:45.131 --> 00:33:48.760
stuff that's from Emma?
These questions were all from Emma.
Yeah.
Emma,

549
00:33:49.030 --> 00:33:51.820
I can't teach you because I'm on a podcast right now,

550
00:33:51.850 --> 00:33:56.320
but luckily there's so many good books out there and you can make little

551
00:33:56.330 --> 00:33:58.290
flashcards just like mark doesn't.

552
00:33:58.330 --> 00:34:02.440
The book with pictures of all the bad stuff out there in nature and that way you

553
00:34:02.441 --> 00:34:03.730
know what poison ivy looks like.

554
00:34:07.510 --> 00:34:08.380
Let's see.

555
00:34:10.180 --> 00:34:13.060
Most important thing about being a warrior kid.

556
00:34:13.090 --> 00:34:15.790
I think the most important thing about being a warrior and the warrior kid is to

557
00:34:15.791 --> 00:34:18.670
be humble and to be humbled means you don't think you're the best thing in the

558
00:34:18.671 --> 00:34:20.290
world.
We shouldn't think that.

559
00:34:20.320 --> 00:34:23.950
The minute that you think that you aren't trying to get better anymore,

560
00:34:24.010 --> 00:34:25.570
you weren't trying to improve yourself.

561
00:34:25.690 --> 00:34:28.000
You're treating people poorly because you think you're better than them.

562
00:34:28.210 --> 00:34:32.500
So there's a key word,
it's called humility and you always want to stay humble.

563
00:34:35.440 --> 00:34:39.250
11 year old that wants to go towards a goal of being a seal.
Same thing.

564
00:34:39.340 --> 00:34:41.110
Work hard.
Workout,
study hard.

565
00:34:42.200 --> 00:34:42.600
<v 2>Okay.</v>

566
00:34:42.600 --> 00:34:46.320
<v 0>Favorite Brazilian Jujitsu move for Uncle Jake.</v>

567
00:34:46.680 --> 00:34:49.320
What do you think uncle Jake's favorite Brazilian Jujitsu move is?

568
00:34:49.410 --> 00:34:52.620
I think it's the rear naked choke.
I haven't confirmed this yet.

569
00:34:55.020 --> 00:35:00.020
And Uncle Jake joined the navy after he got done with high school.

570
00:35:01.230 --> 00:35:02.220
He was 18 years old.

571
00:35:06.840 --> 00:35:10.290
Oh Lucas wants to be a seal or a ranger,

572
00:35:11.400 --> 00:35:14.850
but he has a hard time controlling his temper and following orders from his

573
00:35:14.851 --> 00:35:19.800
superior.
Uncle Jake would say that in the seal teams and in the Rangers,

574
00:35:20.070 --> 00:35:22.620
if you have a bad temper,
you're not going to make it.
So what you,

575
00:35:22.621 --> 00:35:25.110
and you know what a lot of kids have bad tempers.

576
00:35:25.380 --> 00:35:29.400
I had a bad temper when I was a kid and at some point you got to realize that

577
00:35:29.401 --> 00:35:31.350
that bad temper is not good.

578
00:35:31.950 --> 00:35:34.170
And so what you have to do is learn to control your temper.

579
00:35:34.230 --> 00:35:36.930
So it's what I talked about earlier.
If you start feeling that temper,

580
00:35:36.931 --> 00:35:39.750
if start feeling your face getting red and you start feel most tears coming in

581
00:35:39.751 --> 00:35:42.840
your eyes,
you gotta say to Yourself,
Oh,
I'm losing my temper.

582
00:35:42.841 --> 00:35:45.480
I'm actually being weak right now by losing my temper.

583
00:35:45.930 --> 00:35:48.840
So what I'm gonna do is I'm going to take a breath,
I'm going to step back,

584
00:35:48.841 --> 00:35:49.561
I'm going to calm down.

585
00:35:49.561 --> 00:35:53.130
Even if you have to walk away and go in your room for a minute and just sit down

586
00:35:53.520 --> 00:35:57.030
and take a breath and get control of your temper.
And the older you get,

587
00:35:57.060 --> 00:35:59.070
the better you'll get at controlling your temper.

588
00:36:00.240 --> 00:36:04.350
And then his follow as far as following orders from your superiors in the

589
00:36:04.351 --> 00:36:06.750
military,
seal teams,
rangers,

590
00:36:07.080 --> 00:36:10.230
you absolutely have to listen to the people that you work for.

591
00:36:10.260 --> 00:36:11.910
And it's the same thing in the civilian sector.

592
00:36:12.300 --> 00:36:16.620
So a good way to to practice that is by listening to what your parents say.

593
00:36:17.130 --> 00:36:21.180
Now,
you might not think what your parents say,
you might not feel like doing it.

594
00:36:21.690 --> 00:36:23.190
You might not feel like cleaning your room.

595
00:36:23.220 --> 00:36:26.340
So it's good practice to look at your dad when he says to clean your room and

596
00:36:26.341 --> 00:36:28.470
say,
no problem dad.
I got it.

597
00:36:29.580 --> 00:36:31.260
That's good practice for when you get in the military.

598
00:36:32.340 --> 00:36:35.880
Now you should also have a conversation with your dad and say,
Hey dad,

599
00:36:35.881 --> 00:36:36.960
why is this important?

600
00:36:37.380 --> 00:36:41.160
And have them explain it to you so that way you're more of a team than just your

601
00:36:41.161 --> 00:36:44.220
dad barking orders at you.
Once you understand why it's important,

602
00:36:44.580 --> 00:36:49.200
that will help you get motivated to do the job that's in front of you.

603
00:36:51.590 --> 00:36:54.230
We got a bunch of questions from a guy named Mike Hurley.

604
00:36:54.260 --> 00:36:57.530
Mike Kerley from,
he's a teacher,

605
00:36:57.890 --> 00:37:00.950
so I'm going to have to go through these pretty pretty quickly.

606
00:37:02.780 --> 00:37:07.310
First one is from,
I think this one's from Mike as well.

607
00:37:08.330 --> 00:37:10.370
How'd you get the idea of writing way of the warrior kid?

608
00:37:10.640 --> 00:37:13.460
A lot of the kids books that I read from my own kids,

609
00:37:13.520 --> 00:37:17.180
I didn't like him very much.
Do I have any new books coming out?

610
00:37:17.270 --> 00:37:22.270
The new book is coming out in May of 2018 favorite book I have written while

611
00:37:23.511 --> 00:37:27.320
I've only written two books so far,
one is called way of the warrior kid,

612
00:37:27.321 --> 00:37:29.300
which is for kids and the other one is called extreme ownership,

613
00:37:29.301 --> 00:37:31.940
which is for adults and I like them both.

614
00:37:32.990 --> 00:37:35.240
Did I relate to mark when I was younger?
Yes.

615
00:37:35.420 --> 00:37:38.750
I think that's one of the reasons why this book is so popular is because

616
00:37:38.751 --> 00:37:39.860
everyone can relate to mark.

617
00:37:40.220 --> 00:37:44.990
There's no one that woke up and in and they were new when they were 10 years
old.

618
00:37:44.991 --> 00:37:48.620
They were the best at everything.
No,
everyone has problems with different things.

619
00:37:49.340 --> 00:37:50.900
What inspired me to become an author,

620
00:37:51.620 --> 00:37:55.310
I wanted to kind of teach some of the lessons that I had learned.

621
00:37:58.080 --> 00:37:58.913
Let's see.

622
00:38:01.400 --> 00:38:06.380
Kay asks how to improve your grades in math,

623
00:38:06.410 --> 00:38:09.140
how to improve your marks.
You've got to study.
That's the thing.

624
00:38:09.200 --> 00:38:11.330
Just like just like,
just like mark in the book.

625
00:38:11.360 --> 00:38:13.910
He didn't study is timestables and therefore he didn't know them.

626
00:38:14.300 --> 00:38:17.120
So make your flashcards and study.

627
00:38:17.480 --> 00:38:21.650
And then the other big thing that I learned from being in the navy is when you

628
00:38:21.651 --> 00:38:25.400
don't understand something,
you have to ask the question in class,

629
00:38:25.401 --> 00:38:26.570
you have to ask your teacher.

630
00:38:26.960 --> 00:38:30.170
You know why you don't want to ask it because you're embarrassed because you

631
00:38:30.171 --> 00:38:31.580
feel a fool.
If I asked this question,

632
00:38:31.581 --> 00:38:34.970
that means I'm stupid and people will laugh at me.
It's not true.

633
00:38:35.670 --> 00:38:37.420
And even if they do laugh at you,
you know what?

634
00:38:37.421 --> 00:38:41.020
It doesn't matter because when you take the test,
you're going to do better.

635
00:38:41.470 --> 00:38:45.310
So don't be embarrassed to ask questions,
ask questions and study hard.

636
00:38:46.630 --> 00:38:50.980
Next,
what mental challenges did you face training to be a navy seal?

637
00:38:52.720 --> 00:38:53.200
Well,

638
00:38:53.200 --> 00:38:57.730
there's all kinds of challenges that you faced trying to become a navy seal.
And

639
00:38:59.430 --> 00:39:01.620
I'm trying to think of my personal ones.

640
00:39:04.380 --> 00:39:09.120
Well,
there's a bunch.
And the biggest thing for me is I wasn't great at anything.

641
00:39:09.570 --> 00:39:12.030
I wasn't the fastest runner.
I wasn't the fastest swimmer.

642
00:39:12.031 --> 00:39:15.610
I wasn't fastest at the obstacle course.
I wasn't the best shot with a pistol,

643
00:39:15.611 --> 00:39:16.410
a rifle.

644
00:39:16.410 --> 00:39:21.390
So everything for me was hard and I had to work hard at everything that I did.

645
00:39:21.750 --> 00:39:24.270
And so for me there was never a mental rest.
Some guys,

646
00:39:24.271 --> 00:39:26.780
they might not be the best runner,
but there a great swimmer.

647
00:39:26.781 --> 00:39:30.030
So during the swim it was kind of easy for him.
I didn't really have any breaks,

648
00:39:30.031 --> 00:39:32.640
so that was probably my biggest mental challenge.

649
00:39:33.040 --> 00:39:33.873
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

650
00:39:34.510 --> 00:39:36.970
<v 0>Next is from a reader.</v>

651
00:39:41.040 --> 00:39:44.550
How am I supposed to stop missing one of my friends that live really far away

652
00:39:45.300 --> 00:39:47.430
and we've been friends for over five years.
Okay,

653
00:39:47.550 --> 00:39:50.580
well when you miss one of your friends,
the best thing to do is write to them,

654
00:39:50.610 --> 00:39:54.160
write them letters,
call them if you can write them emails.

655
00:39:54.180 --> 00:39:56.540
I keep in touch with them and it's no,
it's,
it's,

656
00:39:56.670 --> 00:39:58.440
it's normal to miss your friends when they leave,

657
00:39:58.710 --> 00:40:03.360
so you shouldn't even try and stop missing them.
Just write them letters,

658
00:40:03.450 --> 00:40:08.400
tell him what's going on and maintain contact with them.
Next

659
00:40:10.710 --> 00:40:12.780
uncle.
Dear Uncle Jake,
you are so wise.

660
00:40:12.781 --> 00:40:15.240
You were the only person who knows the answer to this question.

661
00:40:15.420 --> 00:40:18.720
How do I stop eating junk food?
I can't stop.
Help me.

662
00:40:19.080 --> 00:40:23.790
So actually the only person that can stop you from eating junk food isn't uncle

663
00:40:23.791 --> 00:40:26.490
Jake.
It's you.
It's you.

664
00:40:26.491 --> 00:40:31.491
You're the one that has to stop eating junk food and the way you do it isn't as

665
00:40:31.831 --> 00:40:36.000
hard as you think.
Actually,
it's simple.
It's not easy,
but it's simple.

666
00:40:36.480 --> 00:40:40.170
The junk food that you want to put into your mouth,
don't put it into your mouth.

667
00:40:40.290 --> 00:40:44.790
Don't do it.
You know it's weak food.
Like Echo said earlier,

668
00:40:44.791 --> 00:40:47.550
it's weak food and we don't want to eat that week food.
We want the strong food.

669
00:40:48.450 --> 00:40:53.200
So
when it,
when you get tempted to eat that week food,

670
00:40:53.440 --> 00:40:56.890
don't do it.
Don't do it.
Don't take one bite.

671
00:40:56.891 --> 00:40:58.930
Don't even say I'm just going to have one cookie instead of four.

672
00:40:58.931 --> 00:41:03.220
Don't have any cause once you have one it's all no.
So

673
00:41:04.750 --> 00:41:09.370
the way that you stopped from eating junk food is by stop eating junk food.

674
00:41:09.730 --> 00:41:13.900
That's what you need to do
next.

675
00:41:15.910 --> 00:41:17.800
Why did I write,
decided to write this story?

676
00:41:18.520 --> 00:41:21.010
Cause I thought there was a lot of kids that could learn from it.

677
00:41:21.400 --> 00:41:24.280
Even my own kids.
That's one of the main reasons I wrote it.

678
00:41:24.700 --> 00:41:26.950
To have any other books coming out?
Yes.

679
00:41:27.370 --> 00:41:29.800
May of 2018 hours have a book coming out.

680
00:41:29.830 --> 00:41:32.620
It's more of an adult book coming out in October.

681
00:41:34.160 --> 00:41:36.590
What's the favorite book I've written?
I already answered that one.

682
00:41:37.660 --> 00:41:41.690
What have I ever been to mark situation when I was a child?
Yes.
Like I said,

683
00:41:41.750 --> 00:41:45.650
of course it was hard.
I couldn't do a bunch of pull ups.

684
00:41:45.651 --> 00:41:49.580
I was not one of the stronger kids.
I had trouble in school sometimes,

685
00:41:49.670 --> 00:41:52.250
so every I,

686
00:41:52.460 --> 00:41:57.460
I relate to everything that mark went through and I saw my own kids go through

687
00:41:57.741 --> 00:41:58.670
those same troubles.

688
00:42:01.380 --> 00:42:04.230
How can I stop eating so much junk food?
I already answered that.

689
00:42:04.231 --> 00:42:08.690
Stop eating junk food.
How can I convince my parents to get a puppy?
Ooh.

690
00:42:10.110 --> 00:42:11.430
Now if I could answer that question,

691
00:42:11.431 --> 00:42:13.380
I'd probably be the most popular person in the world.

692
00:42:14.520 --> 00:42:18.570
It's really hard because what kids don't realize is that puppies are a huge,

693
00:42:18.600 --> 00:42:21.240
huge responsibility and it's,

694
00:42:21.390 --> 00:42:25.980
I have had dogs a lot in my life and I have kids a lot in my life and I have

695
00:42:25.981 --> 00:42:26.814
four kids.

696
00:42:26.910 --> 00:42:30.690
Then I will tell you that the responsibility of a dog is almost as much as the

697
00:42:30.691 --> 00:42:32.220
responsibility of having a kid.

698
00:42:33.120 --> 00:42:37.920
So it's not really easy to get a to own a dog.

699
00:42:38.430 --> 00:42:40.500
So the best thing you can do,

700
00:42:40.530 --> 00:42:42.960
I think if you want to convince your parents to let you get a puppy,

701
00:42:43.110 --> 00:42:46.620
which is no guarantee,
the best thing you can do is be a good kid.
Work hard,

702
00:42:46.830 --> 00:42:50.850
show responsibility,
get good grades in school,
help with the chores,

703
00:42:50.970 --> 00:42:54.300
help with the cleaning up.
Because the bottom line is when you,

704
00:42:54.330 --> 00:42:55.230
when you get a puppy,

705
00:42:55.380 --> 00:42:57.720
there's one big issue with a puppy that no one wants to talk about.

706
00:42:57.750 --> 00:43:01.140
And that's puppy Poopoo,
right?
What's going to happen?
Who's going to,

707
00:43:01.141 --> 00:43:02.940
who's going to clean up the puppy Poopoo in the yard?

708
00:43:03.570 --> 00:43:06.540
Is it going to be you because your parents don't think you're going to do it?

709
00:43:06.570 --> 00:43:09.300
And that's one of the main reasons they don't want to get you a puppy because

710
00:43:09.301 --> 00:43:10.740
they don't want to pick up puppy poopoo.

711
00:43:12.950 --> 00:43:14.900
So show that you're responsible.

712
00:43:15.980 --> 00:43:20.030
And how can I convince my parents to allow me to be on social media more than I

713
00:43:20.031 --> 00:43:23.180
am now?
I would say your parents are doing a great job.

714
00:43:23.600 --> 00:43:27.890
The social media is not going to help you and don't try and convince them of

715
00:43:27.891 --> 00:43:31.970
that work on the puppy instead,
that's going to be better for you.

716
00:43:33.320 --> 00:43:34.153
Next,

717
00:43:35.150 --> 00:43:39.290
my brother bullies me and makes me do everything for him and if not,

718
00:43:39.920 --> 00:43:44.220
he says he will take something from me and hide it or hurt me.
Well,

719
00:43:44.350 --> 00:43:46.670
do you got to negotiate with your older brother?
First of all,

720
00:43:46.880 --> 00:43:49.310
he's running around being a bully.
That's not cool at all.

721
00:43:49.790 --> 00:43:54.260
I would talk to your parents about it and say that you're being bullied and

722
00:43:54.650 --> 00:43:56.480
tell,
tell your parents what's going on.

723
00:43:56.780 --> 00:43:59.080
But I would also talk to your brother about it and say,

724
00:43:59.110 --> 00:44:02.000
you know why you doing this to me?
Why are you treating me like this?

725
00:44:02.600 --> 00:44:06.710
Do you think it's fun for me?
And if he doesn't seem to care,

726
00:44:07.070 --> 00:44:12.070
well then you might have to go into some kind of guerrilla warfare against your

727
00:44:13.461 --> 00:44:16.490
brother and start maybe if he wants you to do something for him,

728
00:44:16.760 --> 00:44:18.080
maybe you don't do it perfectly,

729
00:44:18.950 --> 00:44:23.180
do it a little bit less than perfect or maybe take a long time to do it.

730
00:44:24.170 --> 00:44:26.670
And it's really hard.
It's really hard growing up in a,

731
00:44:26.750 --> 00:44:30.110
in a house with older brothers and older sisters that bully you.

732
00:44:30.500 --> 00:44:34.890
So talk to your parents about it and as always,

733
00:44:35.250 --> 00:44:38.610
start doing a bunch of pullups.
Try and learn some Jujitsu.

734
00:44:39.390 --> 00:44:41.700
Learned to stand up for yourself,
study hard,

735
00:44:42.810 --> 00:44:46.260
and also the worst case scenario in this.

736
00:44:47.940 --> 00:44:48.511
If you,

737
00:44:48.511 --> 00:44:52.020
let's say that you can't stop your brother from bullying you because that's just

738
00:44:52.021 --> 00:44:53.670
the way it is and your parents aren't around enough.

739
00:44:53.820 --> 00:44:56.790
You know what you can do from this situation is you can learn from it.

740
00:44:57.420 --> 00:45:01.770
You can learn from your brother by the way he mistreats you.

741
00:45:02.250 --> 00:45:05.340
You can learn that you're never going to do that to other people and you're

742
00:45:05.341 --> 00:45:09.420
never going to do that to other kids and that you're going to treat people much

743
00:45:09.421 --> 00:45:11.520
better than your brother treats you.

744
00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:16.710
So even if you can't stop him and he ends up pulling you until he moves out of

745
00:45:16.711 --> 00:45:17.544
the house,

746
00:45:17.670 --> 00:45:22.670
he's taught you such a valuable lesson about life and about human beings that

747
00:45:24.450 --> 00:45:27.960
it'll be worth it in the long run.
So I know it's tough.

748
00:45:28.770 --> 00:45:31.860
I know it's hard,
but learn as much as you can from it.

749
00:45:32.250 --> 00:45:36.120
And in the meantime also take those steps so that you can stop him.

750
00:45:36.900 --> 00:45:38.760
Good luck with that,
buddy.
That's a tough one.

751
00:45:41.450 --> 00:45:42.060
<v 1>Okay,</v>

752
00:45:42.060 --> 00:45:43.920
<v 0>question one,
what is the meaning of life?</v>

753
00:45:46.120 --> 00:45:50.650
I guess that you are not playing around with any easy questions for uncle Jake,

754
00:45:51.790 --> 00:45:52.623
uncle Jake,

755
00:45:52.630 --> 00:45:56.590
Uncle Jake will tell you that the meaning of his life is to try and help other

756
00:45:56.591 --> 00:45:59.320
people and try and do good in the world.

757
00:45:59.470 --> 00:46:01.300
That's what he's trying to do with his life.

758
00:46:02.470 --> 00:46:04.870
How do I stop my friend from laughing so much?

759
00:46:07.390 --> 00:46:09.970
I would say if your friend is laughing so much,

760
00:46:10.840 --> 00:46:14.320
I don't know why you'd want to stop them unless they're getting in trouble and

761
00:46:14.321 --> 00:46:15.220
if they're getting in trouble,

762
00:46:15.460 --> 00:46:18.610
just go sit in a seat that's not so close to them in class.

763
00:46:19.210 --> 00:46:24.210
I had a friend named writer when I was a kid and he would have laughing attacks

764
00:46:24.610 --> 00:46:28.060
and he would laugh so hard that he would get kicked out of the classroom.

765
00:46:28.600 --> 00:46:31.240
And I remember one time he was laughing so hard,

766
00:46:31.300 --> 00:46:34.810
he got kicked out of the classroom and after about five minutes went by,

767
00:46:35.560 --> 00:46:38.620
I looked to the door where the window was.

768
00:46:38.710 --> 00:46:42.550
There was a window in the door to the classroom and his face came up into the,

769
00:46:42.910 --> 00:46:45.970
into the window and he was still laughing hysterically after five minutes.

770
00:46:46.540 --> 00:46:50.230
So sometimes people laugh and,

771
00:46:50.290 --> 00:46:54.130
and normally people laugh hard when you're not supposed to.

772
00:46:54.190 --> 00:46:56.560
That's one of the things that makes laughing hard funny is you're not supposed

773
00:46:56.561 --> 00:46:57.970
to be laughing.
So yeah,

774
00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:01.900
just move away from him and tell him to calm down or else you can't hang out

775
00:47:01.901 --> 00:47:02.890
with them during classes.

776
00:47:04.380 --> 00:47:05.180
<v 1>Okay.</v>

777
00:47:05.180 --> 00:47:07.550
<v 0>Most pushups,
no.
Okay.
No matter how much stress I put on myself,</v>

778
00:47:07.551 --> 00:47:10.850
the most pushups I can do is 50 how do I improve?
Just keep doing pushups.

779
00:47:10.940 --> 00:47:12.080
If you can do 50 right now,

780
00:47:12.350 --> 00:47:16.920
do two or three sets of 50 and keep doing pushups.
That's how you get booted,

781
00:47:16.940 --> 00:47:21.740
Betty.
Better at any of these things.
Can you join the navy at 12 years old?
No,

782
00:47:21.890 --> 00:47:26.360
you can't join the navy until you turn 18
let's see.

783
00:47:26.810 --> 00:47:28.820
How are we doing on time?
Oh,
I think we're going to make it.

784
00:47:28.960 --> 00:47:33.100
I'm trying to keep this to an hour everybody cause I know I got what great

785
00:47:33.101 --> 00:47:35.500
letter yesterday from a kid that rode,
said,
hey,

786
00:47:35.501 --> 00:47:38.470
thanks for writing way the warrior kid and putting all the lessons in it that

787
00:47:38.471 --> 00:47:39.940
you talk about on your podcast,

788
00:47:40.120 --> 00:47:43.060
but we don't have to listen to your whole podcast,

789
00:47:43.061 --> 00:47:45.010
which gets boring to learn the lessons.

790
00:47:47.110 --> 00:47:52.090
So honesty.
Yes,
kids are always honest and that's,

791
00:47:52.480 --> 00:47:54.790
well kids most of the time are honest.

792
00:47:56.980 --> 00:47:58.690
What is the question on this one?

793
00:47:59.250 --> 00:48:00.083
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

794
00:48:01.670 --> 00:48:06.200
<v 0>Was this book a kid and adult guide to becoming strong and healthy?</v>

795
00:48:06.201 --> 00:48:08.210
Because the books talks about things.

796
00:48:08.810 --> 00:48:11.870
What mark needs to do to become smart and fit.
Yes,

797
00:48:11.960 --> 00:48:13.310
that's exactly what the book was for.

798
00:48:13.850 --> 00:48:18.140
The book was a guidebook for kids to become smarter,
stronger,

799
00:48:18.290 --> 00:48:21.710
faster,
and better people.
That's,
that's what the book is about.

800
00:48:24.450 --> 00:48:27.660
And also,
I wish I would've had this book when I was a kid.

801
00:48:30.190 --> 00:48:32.800
Let's see,
I have a question about the book.
I always fight with my brother.

802
00:48:32.801 --> 00:48:35.480
What should I do?
Well,
that's,

803
00:48:36.450 --> 00:48:40.450
that's a tough one because kids fight with their siblings.

804
00:48:40.510 --> 00:48:43.840
I had two sisters growing up and we got in fights all the time.

805
00:48:43.900 --> 00:48:48.400
And I wish I could go back and be more mature because I was,
you know,
a kid.

806
00:48:48.910 --> 00:48:51.520
And when you look back,
you say,
what was I doing fighting with my two sisters?

807
00:48:51.580 --> 00:48:55.110
That's ridiculous.
So what you need to do is look at the things I,
this is,

808
00:48:55.150 --> 00:48:57.130
this is one thing you can do to start with,

809
00:48:57.310 --> 00:48:58.660
look at the things you're fighting about.

810
00:48:58.810 --> 00:49:02.410
And I can pretty much guarantee that the things you're fighting about are the

811
00:49:02.411 --> 00:49:06.070
most silly and ridiculous things.
Right?
Like what,

812
00:49:07.030 --> 00:49:11.950
what piece of carrot do you get?
I want this carrot.
No,

813
00:49:11.951 --> 00:49:13.690
I want that carrot.
And then you're fighting about it.

814
00:49:13.960 --> 00:49:17.050
What were you going to put your head on the couch?

815
00:49:17.350 --> 00:49:20.500
Don't put your head in near me.
Don't put your foot in near me.
Right?

816
00:49:20.501 --> 00:49:22.360
That's the kind of things that kids fight about.

817
00:49:22.570 --> 00:49:26.200
So what we have to do is instead of letting those things annoy,
you,

818
00:49:27.250 --> 00:49:29.620
just say,
ah,
you know what?
He's gonna put his head over here.

819
00:49:29.650 --> 00:49:30.910
I'm just gonna move my head a little bit.

820
00:49:31.750 --> 00:49:36.750
There's a great a war hero that we had that I talked to named uh,

821
00:49:37.390 --> 00:49:39.700
Captain Charlie Plumb.
And he was in the Vietnam War.

822
00:49:39.701 --> 00:49:42.850
He was a fighter pilot in the Vietnam War and he was shot down and he was held

823
00:49:42.851 --> 00:49:47.530
in a prison camp for six years.
And one of the things that he said,

824
00:49:47.600 --> 00:49:49.140
if you can imagine,
you know,
you,

825
00:49:49.150 --> 00:49:52.990
you think it's hard living with your brother because you have to spend,
you know,

826
00:49:53.050 --> 00:49:54.790
a couple hours a day in the same house.

827
00:49:55.090 --> 00:50:00.090
Imagine being in a little tiny prison cell for six years with other people day

828
00:50:04.301 --> 00:50:06.010
in,
day out,
24 hours a day.

829
00:50:06.820 --> 00:50:10.720
So what they figured out was if they got mad or they got annoyed at something

830
00:50:10.721 --> 00:50:13.180
someone else was doing,
they didn't blame the other person.

831
00:50:13.181 --> 00:50:16.780
They blamed themselves.
So if you don't want to fight with your brother,

832
00:50:17.050 --> 00:50:21.460
stop blaming him for being annoying and start blaming yourself for getting

833
00:50:21.461 --> 00:50:24.070
annoyed and just try and be a little bit more mature about it.

834
00:50:26.630 --> 00:50:29.530
Next,
I enjoyed your book.

835
00:50:29.531 --> 00:50:33.400
I'm going to medical middle school and I don't want to lose touch with people.

836
00:50:33.401 --> 00:50:37.310
Hey,
if you're a,
this happens when kids move around,
just get out,

837
00:50:37.360 --> 00:50:40.090
get their address and start writing letters.
That's what you need to do.

838
00:50:42.190 --> 00:50:46.120
Let's see.
How do you improve and pull ups?
Do pull ups,

839
00:50:46.920 --> 00:50:51.380
how do you improve and running?
Run?
How do you overcome your fears?

840
00:50:52.130 --> 00:50:55.430
Talked about that one.
You train,
you practice and then you face them.

841
00:50:57.860 --> 00:50:59.810
And water healthy foods other than milk.

842
00:50:59.811 --> 00:51:02.990
I think the key thing with healthy foods is to eat things that are made by

843
00:51:02.991 --> 00:51:04.730
nature,
not by man.

844
00:51:04.731 --> 00:51:09.680
So if it comes in a big plastic package in a box,
and it had,

845
00:51:09.690 --> 00:51:11.450
and when you look at the list of ingredients,

846
00:51:11.750 --> 00:51:14.870
it's a 147 words that you can't pronounce.

847
00:51:15.230 --> 00:51:16.820
That's the thing you got to watch out for.

848
00:51:17.210 --> 00:51:20.990
But if it's a carrot or it's an orange or it's a steak or it's a piece of

849
00:51:20.991 --> 00:51:24.620
chicken and the ingredients and the chicken or chicken and the ingredients in

850
00:51:24.621 --> 00:51:27.290
the stake,
our stake and the ingredients and the fishes,

851
00:51:27.291 --> 00:51:30.920
fish and ingredients in the,
in the lettuces,
lettuce,

852
00:51:31.310 --> 00:51:34.250
those are the things you want to try and eat.
Those are the healthiest things.

853
00:51:35.630 --> 00:51:37.760
Major question for Uncle Jake.

854
00:51:37.880 --> 00:51:42.880
Need more money for fidget spinners and a May merge Paki and Roebucks,

855
00:51:45.260 --> 00:51:49.460
but my parents won't let me have money for it.
What should I do?
Really easy.

856
00:51:49.550 --> 00:51:52.760
Get a job.
That's what you do when you need money,
you get a job,

857
00:51:52.761 --> 00:51:54.650
you don't get things for free.
You have to work.

858
00:51:54.890 --> 00:51:58.010
So if you need money for all these ridiculous things that you want to spend it

859
00:51:58.011 --> 00:51:59.960
on,
which by the way,
they're all ridiculous.

860
00:52:00.200 --> 00:52:04.760
You should save your money for some things like pull up bars or just save your

861
00:52:04.761 --> 00:52:07.430
money for your future.
Save it for when you go to college,

862
00:52:08.030 --> 00:52:09.190
but you're not going to get million.

863
00:52:09.250 --> 00:52:12.080
Your parents aren't obligated to give you money for junk,

864
00:52:12.170 --> 00:52:13.340
which is what you want it for.

865
00:52:13.490 --> 00:52:15.560
Your parents are actually smart for not giving you money.

866
00:52:16.400 --> 00:52:20.270
I wouldn't give you money to buy that junk.
So if you want money,

867
00:52:20.540 --> 00:52:24.050
get a job mowing lawns,
pulling out weeds,

868
00:52:24.470 --> 00:52:28.550
throwing newspapers,
whatever it is you've got to do.
But if you want to buy junk,

869
00:52:28.580 --> 00:52:30.320
you've got to do with your own money,
not your parents.

870
00:52:32.930 --> 00:52:36.110
Next question,
if someone's too lazy to get up in the morning and doesn't get,

871
00:52:36.111 --> 00:52:39.200
want to get woken up by someone who is smashing utensils or anything in your

872
00:52:39.201 --> 00:52:41.750
eardrum,
what does a more easier way to get up?

873
00:52:41.751 --> 00:52:44.570
What is an easier way to get up and you are talking about yourself.

874
00:52:44.571 --> 00:52:47.960
That's from our well what you need to do in those situations.

875
00:52:47.961 --> 00:52:50.240
It's getting alarm clock and when the alarm clock goes off,

876
00:52:50.270 --> 00:52:53.420
get up and get out of bed,
and if you still feel tired in the morning,

877
00:52:53.450 --> 00:52:55.370
then you need to go to bed earlier at night.

878
00:52:56.160 --> 00:52:56.700
<v 3>Okay?</v>

879
00:52:56.700 --> 00:52:59.200
<v 0>So it's never easy to get up in the morning.
Get up.</v>

880
00:52:59.340 --> 00:53:00.690
Getting up in the morning is hard.

881
00:53:01.170 --> 00:53:05.060
That's why it's such an edge over normal people,
because normal people,

882
00:53:05.061 --> 00:53:07.830
when they want to sleep,
they want to sleep and sleep and sleep.

883
00:53:07.831 --> 00:53:10.500
And when you sleep,
you're not being productive.
Now of course you need sleep.

884
00:53:11.070 --> 00:53:13.770
It's good for you to sleep.
You're going to be stronger.
The more you sleep,

885
00:53:13.771 --> 00:53:14.790
the stronger you're going to be.

886
00:53:15.510 --> 00:53:18.660
But if you sleep and you don't work out and you sleep and you'd miss your

887
00:53:18.661 --> 00:53:21.120
schoolwork and you sleep and you're just being lazy,

888
00:53:21.330 --> 00:53:25.740
that's not going to be good for you.
So get an alarm clock set,
alarm clock.

889
00:53:25.830 --> 00:53:28.590
When your alarm clock goes off,
get up and get out of bed.

890
00:53:31.160 --> 00:53:33.440
How do I stop eating food that's not healthy?

891
00:53:35.140 --> 00:53:37.840
You stop eating the food that's not healthy.
That's it.
Also,

892
00:53:37.841 --> 00:53:39.130
tell your mom another thing.

893
00:53:39.131 --> 00:53:41.770
For those of you who to ask you this question until your mom and dad not to buy

894
00:53:41.771 --> 00:53:45.550
that food.
You don't want it in the house.
That's what you need to do.

895
00:53:45.551 --> 00:53:47.890
Tell your parents you don't want the ice cream in the house.

896
00:53:48.400 --> 00:53:51.790
You don't want the Cheetos in the house.
You don't want the,

897
00:53:51.791 --> 00:53:52.990
what's another good one?
Echo what?

898
00:53:53.170 --> 00:53:55.360
You don't want the chocolate chip cookies in the house.

899
00:53:55.540 --> 00:53:59.200
Now if you're out and you just had a nice,

900
00:53:59.740 --> 00:54:04.740
you know at a ball game and you play to baseball or you played a soccer game or

901
00:54:05.411 --> 00:54:08.860
a football game and your mom's stops it up,

902
00:54:08.890 --> 00:54:12.010
shop on the way home and says,
hey son,
you played a great game.

903
00:54:12.011 --> 00:54:15.670
You want a chocolate chip cookie?
And you go,
yeah,
that sounds good.
Little reward.

904
00:54:15.730 --> 00:54:17.050
That's okay,
that's great.

905
00:54:17.380 --> 00:54:21.520
But if you have those chocolate chip cookies in your house and you just got done

906
00:54:21.730 --> 00:54:25.240
playing two hours worth of video games and you're feeling a little bit hungry,

907
00:54:25.241 --> 00:54:26.110
so you go in the kitchen,

908
00:54:26.111 --> 00:54:29.710
there's a chocolate chip cookie box and you eat nine of them,

909
00:54:30.160 --> 00:54:34.450
that's not good.
So don't do that.

910
00:54:34.720 --> 00:54:38.950
Or Soda or they have soda is horrible.
You shouldn't,

911
00:54:38.951 --> 00:54:42.220
you should beg your parents not to bring soda in the House.
If you're,

912
00:54:42.340 --> 00:54:44.470
if your parents bring soda in the house,
you should say,

913
00:54:44.620 --> 00:54:49.360
oh do you not like me cause why are you feeding me this?
This is poison.

914
00:54:49.600 --> 00:54:53.470
Don't feed me poison.
I want water.
Just bring me some water.

915
00:54:53.950 --> 00:54:55.060
Mom and dad please.

916
00:54:57.680 --> 00:54:58.670
<v 2>Let's see</v>

917
00:55:00.520 --> 00:55:05.170
<v 0>how to start a good habit such as working out your start working out.</v>

918
00:55:06.370 --> 00:55:10.690
Okay.
Next.
How old was uncle Jake when he joined the seal teams?

919
00:55:10.840 --> 00:55:15.690
He was 18 can you join at 10 years old?
No.
How was Uncle Jake?

920
00:55:15.691 --> 00:55:20.230
Six periods in the seal teams.
He loved it all.
Uncle Jake,

921
00:55:20.231 --> 00:55:25.180
I have a question for you.
How do you get stronger and not get bullied?

922
00:55:25.360 --> 00:55:29.800
Rd answered that one.
You work out,
you trained,
you Jitsu,

923
00:55:29.801 --> 00:55:31.570
you trained boxing,
you train wrestling,

924
00:55:31.810 --> 00:55:36.340
you're trained judo and you stand up to those bullies.

925
00:55:37.350 --> 00:55:41.530
Like I said,
not always going to win,
but you'll win in the long run.

926
00:55:44.220 --> 00:55:48.690
Five year old wants to know why you have to do pull ups to be a warrior kid.

927
00:55:49.050 --> 00:55:51.510
You don't have to do pull ups to be a warrior kid,

928
00:55:51.511 --> 00:55:53.550
but pull ups is a great exercise.

929
00:55:53.610 --> 00:55:56.910
Like there's some people that maybe they have some issue with that maybe they

930
00:55:56.911 --> 00:56:00.930
got a hurt shoulder or a hurt arm and they can't do pullups and that's okay.

931
00:56:00.960 --> 00:56:03.030
You can still be a warrior kid,
but if you,

932
00:56:03.170 --> 00:56:04.980
if your arms are healthy and you can do pull ups,

933
00:56:05.000 --> 00:56:07.920
they're great thing to do because it means you can handle your own weight.

934
00:56:08.220 --> 00:56:11.820
It means you can carry yourself.
It means you can take care of yourself.

935
00:56:12.510 --> 00:56:14.550
So that's why pull ups are great,

936
00:56:15.690 --> 00:56:17.850
a great exercise and they're also,

937
00:56:18.240 --> 00:56:21.690
I've read a lot of stuff that if kids can do pull ups,
it,
it,
it,

938
00:56:22.320 --> 00:56:26.140
it helps their overall health.
So cloves are great for you.

939
00:56:26.200 --> 00:56:28.870
It's a great exercise if you can do them,
do them.

940
00:56:29.500 --> 00:56:32.260
If you're injured or you've got some kind of an issue where you can't do them,

941
00:56:32.410 --> 00:56:35.140
try and find a different exercise that you can do and focus on that one.

942
00:56:37.150 --> 00:56:40.600
Next question's from six year old boy

943
00:56:42.460 --> 00:56:46.570
McGee.
Is Uncle Jake Real?
No.
Uncle Jake is a fictional character.

944
00:56:46.571 --> 00:56:50.560
How old is Uncle Jake?
Uncle Jake in the book is,
I think about 26 years old.

945
00:56:51.370 --> 00:56:55.990
And what keeps uncle Jake moving during really hard times when the going gets

946
00:56:55.991 --> 00:56:59.140
tough for Uncle Jake?
You know what Uncle Jake does?

947
00:56:59.560 --> 00:57:01.330
He actually enjoys it.

948
00:57:01.600 --> 00:57:04.720
He knows he's being challenged and so he pushes himself

949
00:57:07.580 --> 00:57:09.980
next.
When you're working out

950
00:57:11.570 --> 00:57:15.500
and feeling under the weather,
should you still give 100% well,

951
00:57:16.850 --> 00:57:20.810
actually,
if you're feeling sick,
maybe it's time for a little rest.

952
00:57:20.840 --> 00:57:24.890
If you just don't feel 100% like maybe you're feeling a little tired,

953
00:57:25.160 --> 00:57:26.720
a little mopey that day,

954
00:57:27.320 --> 00:57:30.080
still get in there and you're not gonna be able to give 100% everyday.

955
00:57:30.140 --> 00:57:33.380
No one can give 100% every day.
You'll run out of percent.

956
00:57:34.340 --> 00:57:39.230
So you've got to save some of that percent.
So you can't give 100% every day,

957
00:57:39.260 --> 00:57:42.710
but give what you can do to,
you can't get in there and make it happen.

958
00:57:43.340 --> 00:57:47.810
How is Uncle Jake doing in college?
Uncle Jake is doing outstanding in college.

959
00:57:48.020 --> 00:57:51.050
Did Uncle Jake respond to Mark's letter?
Yes,
he did.

960
00:57:51.110 --> 00:57:54.740
And what was the response you'll find out in May when the next book comes out?

961
00:57:57.200 --> 00:58:00.050
How uncle Jake's knows so many languages.

962
00:58:01.540 --> 00:58:06.490
And how does he know the Warrior Code in the book?
Uncle Jake studies languages.

963
00:58:06.491 --> 00:58:09.460
When you're,
when you're in the military and you go to other countries,

964
00:58:09.820 --> 00:58:12.370
a lot of times you'll study the language that they speak there so you can

965
00:58:12.371 --> 00:58:13.840
communicate with the local people.

966
00:58:13.960 --> 00:58:17.470
So that's how uncle Jake knows a little bit of a lot of different languages.

967
00:58:18.400 --> 00:58:22.000
And how does he know the warrior codes in the book he studies and reads about

968
00:58:22.001 --> 00:58:25.930
the past and reads about history and reads about what other warriors were like

969
00:58:25.931 --> 00:58:29.470
so that he can figure out what they did well so he can do the same thing.

970
00:58:30.400 --> 00:58:32.500
How many pull ups can uncle Jake do?

971
00:58:33.220 --> 00:58:37.210
Uncle Jake can do 75 pull ups.

972
00:58:38.470 --> 00:58:42.520
Has Uncle Jake ever jumped off a bridge into a lake before?
Many times.

973
00:58:43.900 --> 00:58:48.640
What was your job in the kneel in the navy seals.
And what team were you on?

974
00:58:48.970 --> 00:58:53.920
Well,
this is Jocko and Jocko.
I was on my job.

975
00:58:54.130 --> 00:58:55.570
I started off as a radio man,

976
00:58:55.571 --> 00:59:00.571
which I meant I carried the radio and then I became an officer,

977
00:59:00.581 --> 00:59:05.440
which means I would be in charge of a seal squad or a seal platoon or a seal

978
00:59:05.441 --> 00:59:09.160
task unit.
And then the seal teams I was on,

979
00:59:09.370 --> 00:59:14.370
I was on seal team one seal team to seal team three and seal team seven.

980
00:59:17.630 --> 00:59:20.270
Question from warrior kid Aiden,

981
00:59:20.570 --> 00:59:24.410
what kind of would you recommend for 12 year old boy to get stronger push ups,

982
00:59:24.620 --> 00:59:26.510
pull ups,
sit ups,

983
00:59:26.840 --> 00:59:30.320
squats and I would do a lot of those,
like I said,

984
00:59:30.530 --> 00:59:34.580
eight to 10 sets and,
and that's what you build up to when you first start.

985
00:59:34.581 --> 00:59:38.690
You might only be able to do three or four sets and then sometimes you do one

986
00:59:38.691 --> 00:59:41.930
day you do pullups eight sets of Poles the next day do pushups,

987
00:59:41.931 --> 00:59:43.820
eight sets of pushups the next day do squats,

988
00:59:43.821 --> 00:59:46.190
eight sets of squats and just keep working.

989
00:59:47.860 --> 00:59:48.693
<v 1>Next,</v>

990
00:59:50.920 --> 00:59:55.610
<v 0>what is the middle name?
Uncle Jake's middle name.</v>

991
00:59:55.611 --> 00:59:57.430
You're gonna have to find that one out in the second book.

992
00:59:58.300 --> 00:59:59.680
And what was it like to be in the navy?

993
00:59:59.681 --> 01:00:04.681
Seals being in the seal teams is so fun and it was a great job and I loved every

994
01:00:06.401 --> 01:00:07.234
second of it.

995
01:00:07.480 --> 01:00:12.480
And Uncle Jake loved the seal teams as well and it's also a dangerous job.

996
01:00:13.360 --> 01:00:16.690
So a lot of people think that they want to join the seal teams because it's a

997
01:00:16.691 --> 01:00:19.450
lot of fun and it looks cool and you get to do cool stuff,

998
01:00:19.451 --> 01:00:22.510
but you also got to remember it's a very dangerous job.

999
01:00:23.440 --> 01:00:28.090
And being uh,
being in the seal teams isn't just fun all the time.

1000
01:00:28.091 --> 01:00:31.930
It's hard work,
very hard work and it's a very dangerous sometimes.

1001
01:00:32.440 --> 01:00:36.650
So if it's something that a lot of a lot of kids have been asking about,
how do,

1002
01:00:36.670 --> 01:00:38.290
what do I do to get ready for the seal teams?

1003
01:00:38.291 --> 01:00:43.291
You need to make sure that you have the right attitude about danger because it's

1004
01:00:43.331 --> 01:00:46.660
a very dangerous job sometimes,
but it's also a lot of fun.

1005
01:00:48.610 --> 01:00:52.540
We'll uncle Jake come back to mentor mark in his teenage years.
Yes he will.

1006
01:00:52.930 --> 01:00:57.930
He's going to mentor him for about six bucks until he's done with his high

1007
01:00:59.831 --> 01:01:03.360
school career.
Let's see,

1008
01:01:03.361 --> 01:01:06.990
Nolan and Brady ask,
how are you so smart?

1009
01:01:07.700 --> 01:01:08.533
<v 1>Well,</v>

1010
01:01:09.450 --> 01:01:12.510
<v 0>I'm not that smart.
Uncle Jake is very smart,</v>

1011
01:01:12.780 --> 01:01:15.260
but the way you get smarter by reading,
that's the,

1012
01:01:15.280 --> 01:01:17.400
to me that's one of the most important reading and studying.

1013
01:01:17.401 --> 01:01:18.300
That's how you get smart.

1014
01:01:18.870 --> 01:01:22.740
So read and study as much as you can and find books that you're interested in.

1015
01:01:23.520 --> 01:01:26.220
I read a lot of books about war cause I'm very interested in war,

1016
01:01:26.850 --> 01:01:27.421
but those are the,

1017
01:01:27.421 --> 01:01:30.810
those are the kinds of books that I'm interested in and there's a lot of books

1018
01:01:30.811 --> 01:01:33.570
about that.
But anything that you're interested in,
if you're interested in cars,

1019
01:01:33.571 --> 01:01:36.120
read about cars and how they work.
If you're interested in computers,

1020
01:01:36.121 --> 01:01:39.210
read about how computers work.
If you're interested in space,
travel,

1021
01:01:39.330 --> 01:01:42.390
read books about space travel.
But the more you read,

1022
01:01:42.510 --> 01:01:43.530
the smarter you're going to be.

1023
01:01:47.590 --> 01:01:48.520
Let's see.

1024
01:01:50.560 --> 01:01:53.350
How can I get my little brother more interested in the story and reading the

1025
01:01:53.351 --> 01:01:55.510
book if he doesn't like reading that much,
read it to them.

1026
01:01:55.750 --> 01:01:57.040
Sit Down with them and read it to him.

1027
01:01:58.050 --> 01:01:58.810
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

1028
01:01:58.810 --> 01:02:01.850
<v 0>Five-Year-Old,
a question here.
What should I do in my friends?</v>

1029
01:02:01.851 --> 01:02:04.700
Don't want to play with me at school.
I say you play by yourself.

1030
01:02:05.300 --> 01:02:10.130
I say you go over and find the pull up bar and find the swing set and do things

1031
01:02:10.131 --> 01:02:11.180
that you can just do by herself.

1032
01:02:11.181 --> 01:02:14.420
And every once in a while go over and see what they're doing and ask them about

1033
01:02:14.421 --> 01:02:16.880
it and see if you know,
if they need anyone else to play with them.

1034
01:02:17.300 --> 01:02:19.950
And if they don't,
then that's fine.
Like I said,
it's,

1035
01:02:19.951 --> 01:02:23.790
it's okay to be alone sometimes and sometimes kids you don't.

1036
01:02:23.791 --> 01:02:24.810
One of the hardest things,
one of the,

1037
01:02:24.820 --> 01:02:28.530
another reason why I wrote this book is that being a kid is hard and kids can be

1038
01:02:28.531 --> 01:02:32.400
really mean.
And when I was a kid,
I felt both sides of that.

1039
01:02:32.430 --> 01:02:35.670
Sometimes I had kids be mean to me and sometimes I was meeting the other kids,

1040
01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:40.500
like I said,
because I was immature and I didn't know.
So the older I got,

1041
01:02:40.501 --> 01:02:43.140
the nicer you can be.
But sometimes when you're,
you know,

1042
01:02:43.170 --> 01:02:45.810
six and seven and eight years old,
sometimes kids can be really mean.

1043
01:02:46.410 --> 01:02:50.550
And that doesn't mean you should be mean.
In fact what it means.

1044
01:02:50.551 --> 01:02:54.060
You should be nice,
so if you've got kids that don't want to play with you,

1045
01:02:54.540 --> 01:02:56.610
that's okay.
Spend some time by herself.

1046
01:02:56.611 --> 01:02:58.830
Look for some other kids that maybe do want to hang out a little bit.

1047
01:03:00.540 --> 01:03:02.730
What do you do on a daily basis as a navy seal?

1048
01:03:02.970 --> 01:03:07.140
It's really hard to describe what you do as a navy seal on a daily basis because

1049
01:03:07.141 --> 01:03:09.330
it changes every day.
Sometimes you're parachuting,

1050
01:03:09.331 --> 01:03:12.960
sometimes you're shooting guns.
Sometimes you're blowing things up.

1051
01:03:12.961 --> 01:03:15.330
Sometimes you're working out,
sometimes you're doing paperwork,

1052
01:03:15.930 --> 01:03:19.020
sometimes you're traveling.
Sometimes you're going on a long patrols,

1053
01:03:19.021 --> 01:03:21.660
which is like a hike through the desert or through the jungle or through the

1054
01:03:21.661 --> 01:03:26.010
mountains.
Sometimes you're in the water doing diving.
Sometimes you're,

1055
01:03:26.040 --> 01:03:27.120
it's just a very,

1056
01:03:27.121 --> 01:03:30.810
it's very hard to describe what you do every single day because it's different

1057
01:03:30.811 --> 01:03:34.200
every day and that's one of the things that makes the job very exciting and fun.

1058
01:03:34.440 --> 01:03:36.150
They said you get to do different stuff all the time.

1059
01:03:37.950 --> 01:03:42.120
What tips and tricks would you have for getting up and getting after it?

1060
01:03:42.121 --> 01:03:45.180
When I'm not feeling it.
That's from Gavin.
I think that was a,

1061
01:03:45.181 --> 01:03:48.630
that was a video one Gavin said,
and he's not feeling it.

1062
01:03:48.631 --> 01:03:53.631
Sometimes those are the special days where you actually have to do it,

1063
01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:56.160
so the days when you're not feeling it are the days where you get better.

1064
01:03:56.161 --> 01:03:58.740
The days that you don't want to study,
those are the days you get smarter.

1065
01:03:58.741 --> 01:04:00.930
The days that you don't want to work out,
but you can work out anyways.

1066
01:04:01.050 --> 01:04:04.290
Those are the days you get stronger,
so when you're not feeling it,
tell yourself,

1067
01:04:04.320 --> 01:04:07.320
Ooh,
good.
It's an opportunity for me to step up,

1068
01:04:07.350 --> 01:04:09.240
overcome some weakness and get better.

1069
01:04:11.480 --> 01:04:14.270
What made uncle Jake and Jocko want to be a navy seal?
Like I said,

1070
01:04:14.540 --> 01:04:15.890
I always wanted to be a commando.

1071
01:04:16.610 --> 01:04:20.360
Kids in class want to know what Jake's purposes for going to college,

1072
01:04:21.020 --> 01:04:22.880
what's his new goal?
Well,

1073
01:04:23.360 --> 01:04:28.360
Uncle Jake has been an enlisted guy in the seal teams and he wants to become an

1074
01:04:29.661 --> 01:04:31.730
officer.
He wants to move into more of a leadership role,

1075
01:04:32.090 --> 01:04:34.760
and so what he's going to do is he's going to go to college,

1076
01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:36.350
he's going to get his degree,

1077
01:04:36.800 --> 01:04:41.800
and then he's hopefully going to go back to the seal teams as an officer so he

1078
01:04:41.811 --> 01:04:45.920
can be in charge of a seal platoon.
That's one of his goals.

1079
01:04:49.900 --> 01:04:53.320
The inspiration for mark,
like I said,
was Mark Lee,

1080
01:04:54.010 --> 01:04:58.810
and that's who he's named after.
But also mark represents all kinds of kids,

1081
01:04:59.050 --> 01:05:03.760
even myself and my own kids is,
you know,
it's like I said,
it's hard being a kid.

1082
01:05:03.940 --> 01:05:06.820
So mark is a representation of some of the struggles that kids face,

1083
01:05:06.821 --> 01:05:10.030
and then the struggles aren't going to be the exact same,
right?

1084
01:05:10.210 --> 01:05:12.820
Some kids might be good at math,
but they're not good at spelling.

1085
01:05:13.210 --> 01:05:16.150
Some kids might be good at math and spelling,

1086
01:05:16.151 --> 01:05:18.580
but they can't any history facts.

1087
01:05:19.120 --> 01:05:21.370
So your challenges are going to be different.

1088
01:05:21.371 --> 01:05:23.860
Some kids might be good at pull ups,
but they're not fast runners.

1089
01:05:24.040 --> 01:05:27.850
Some kids might be fast runners,
but they're not good at throwing a baseball.

1090
01:05:28.390 --> 01:05:29.980
So the challenges are different.

1091
01:05:29.981 --> 01:05:33.520
But how you overcome those challenges are the same and that's through hard work

1092
01:05:33.521 --> 01:05:37.570
and practice.
So that was the inspiration.
And like I said,

1093
01:05:37.571 --> 01:05:41.620
the Uncle Jake to me was always in my mind just the,
the ultimate seal.

1094
01:05:42.880 --> 01:05:45.550
And that's what I tried to make him to be like.

1095
01:05:46.450 --> 01:05:50.710
And Mark was an average kid that's going to do above average things,

1096
01:05:51.130 --> 01:05:52.900
through hard work and through discipline.

1097
01:05:54.340 --> 01:05:59.340
And so those are the questions that we had for this podcast and appreciate all

1098
01:06:04.061 --> 01:06:06.410
those questions that everyone sent me.
I know it's,
um,

1099
01:06:06.460 --> 01:06:10.450
a lot of stuff out there and I know that it's,

1100
01:06:10.640 --> 01:06:12.040
it was hard for me to go through them all,

1101
01:06:12.041 --> 01:06:15.280
but I was really thankful that we got all those questions and I'm sure we'll

1102
01:06:15.281 --> 01:06:18.670
have some more questions in the future.
Thanks for reading the book.

1103
01:06:19.060 --> 01:06:24.060
Thanks for showing all those cool pictures of everyone out there reading the

1104
01:06:24.191 --> 01:06:28.660
book and doing their timestables and studying and using flashcards and doing

1105
01:06:28.661 --> 01:06:31.960
pull ups.
That's great for me to see.
And like I said,

1106
01:06:31.961 --> 01:06:34.600
I liked seeing kids do things where they're getting better.

1107
01:06:35.710 --> 01:06:38.770
So thanks for reading the book and,
and telling your friends about the book.

1108
01:06:38.771 --> 01:06:43.360
I appreciate it.
And most of all,
thanks for training hard.

1109
01:06:43.480 --> 01:06:48.340
Thanks for studying hard and thanks for working hard to get stronger,

1110
01:06:48.700 --> 01:06:51.760
smarter,
faster,
and better.

1111
01:06:53.050 --> 01:06:57.040
So stay on the path of discipline and keep getting after it.

1112
01:06:58.090 --> 01:07:03.090
Until next time from Uncle Jake and echo and Jocko out.
