This is Jocko podcast number 39 with Echo Charles and me,

2
00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:10.080
Jocko Willink.
Good Evening Echo.
Good evening.

3
00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.880
I heard of a high British officer who went over the battlefield just after the

4
00:00:22.201 --> 00:00:23.040
action was over.

5
00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:28.770
American boys were still lying dead in their foxholes.

6
00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:33.450
Their rifle still grasped and firing position in their dead hands

7
00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:40.310
and the veteran English soldier remarked time and again in a sort of hushed

8
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.180
eulogy spoken only to himself.

9
00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:46.690
<v 1>Okay.</v>

10
00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:50.350
<v 0>Brave man.
Brave men.
Yeah,</v>

11
00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:59.640
and that is the name of the book we're going to delve into now.

12
00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:01.870
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

13
00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:03.910
<v 0>brave men can.</v>

14
00:01:03.911 --> 00:01:08.911
A few episodes ago we talked with Kiron Dardy

15
00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:16.150
war photographer and when we talk with him,

16
00:01:16.151 --> 00:01:21.151
we talked about war correspondents as well and I wanted to

17
00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:25.643
<v 1>get</v>

18
00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.300
<v 0>a war correspondent here and in this case,</v>

19
00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:35.930
the one that we're going to be talking to is possibly the most famous war

20
00:01:39.151 --> 00:01:42.810
correspondent ever guy by the name of Ernie pile

21
00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.890
and we will join him now,
Paul,
a warship

22
00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:56.610
steaming towards an inevitable invasion.

23
00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:13.860
The front line soldier I knew lived for months like an animal and it was a

24
00:02:14.441 --> 00:02:18.280
veteran in the cruel,
fierce squirreled of death.

25
00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.480
Everything was abnormal and unstable in his life.

26
00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:28.110
He was filthy dirty eight if and when a slept on hard ground without cover.

27
00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:34.530
His clothes were greasy and he lived in a constant haze of dust pastored by

28
00:02:35.141 --> 00:02:37.030
flies and heat moving,

29
00:02:37.031 --> 00:02:41.860
constantly deprived of all things that met once meant stability,

30
00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:46.540
things such as walls,
chairs,
floors,

31
00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:51.310
windows,
faucets,
shelves,
Coca Cola.

32
00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:56.290
And the little matter of knowing that he would go to bed at night in the same

33
00:02:56.291 --> 00:02:58.360
place he had left in the morning,

34
00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:04.860
the front line soldier has to harden his inside as well as his outside or he

35
00:03:05.621 --> 00:03:07.930
would crack under the strain.

36
00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:09.930
<v 1>Okay.</v>

37
00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:14.930
<v 0>Some thoughts from Ernie pile out on a ship getting ready for this invasion,</v>

38
00:03:15.031 --> 00:03:20.031
talking about what the soldiers were like and he'd been in Africa and now he's

39
00:03:20.701 --> 00:03:24.120
out there with sailors and he has something to say about the sailors as well.

40
00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:26.640
Of course when sailors die,

41
00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:31.700
death for them is just as horrible and sometimes they die in greater masses than

42
00:03:31.891 --> 00:03:35.850
soldiers,
but until the enemy comes over the horizon,

43
00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:41.120
a sailor doesn't have to fight a front line soldier has to fight everything all

44
00:03:41.971 --> 00:03:46.770
the time.
It makes a difference in a man's character.

45
00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:51.840
And Ernie pile goes on to talk about

46
00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:56.760
what he thinks of the front line soldier.

47
00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:01.200
Everyone by now knows how I feel about the infantry.

48
00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:06.000
I'm a rabid one man movement bent on tracking down and stamping out everybody

49
00:04:06.001 --> 00:04:10.770
else in the world who doesn't fully appreciate the common front line soldier.

50
00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:16.600
And if I haven't made myself perfectly clear

51
00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:22.030
in everything I say in everything I do,

52
00:04:22.031 --> 00:04:27.031
that's the same exact feeling that I have about the infantry,

53
00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:31.620
respect and admiration.

54
00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:38.520
And now he's talking about what it was like,
what are the,

55
00:04:38.521 --> 00:04:41.820
what's going through their minds as they're going to partake in this,

56
00:04:41.821 --> 00:04:45.930
our invasion it and you gotta remember he's going on an invasion to wait when

57
00:04:45.931 --> 00:04:49.650
when he,
when these things are happening.
This is a war correspondent.

58
00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:53.430
This isn't somebody that's reporting from some safe position and you,

59
00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:55.080
and you're going to see plenty of that here.

60
00:04:55.200 --> 00:05:00.200
He's going in so he can relate to what the troopers are going through mentally.

61
00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:08.610
And this is a very really
accurate

62
00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:13.330
description.
And back to the book.

63
00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:17.830
I don't believe one of us was afraid of the physical part of dying.

64
00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:20.080
That isn't the way it is.

65
00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:25.290
The emotion is rather one of almost desperate reluctance to give up the future.

66
00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:27.580
<v 1>Okay.</v>

67
00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:29.080
<v 0>They're not afraid of the physical stuff.</v>

68
00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:32.320
It's the reluctance to give up the future.

69
00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:35.171
I suppose.

70
00:05:35.171 --> 00:05:39.580
That's splitting hairs and that it really all comes under the heading of fear.

71
00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:42.640
Yet somehow there is a difference.

72
00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:47.050
These gravely yearned for futures of men.

73
00:05:47.051 --> 00:05:49.930
Going into battle includes so many things,

74
00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:54.310
things such as seeing the old lady again of going to college,

75
00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:59.150
of staying in the navy for a career of holding on need just once your own kid

76
00:05:59.151 --> 00:06:00.500
whom you've never seen.

77
00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:01.900
<v 1>Okay.</v>

78
00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:03.730
<v 0>Of again,
becoming champions,</v>

79
00:06:03.731 --> 00:06:08.731
salesman of your territory or driving a coal truck around streets of Kansas City

80
00:06:08.921 --> 00:06:10.450
once more and yes,

81
00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:15.640
even just sitting in the sun once more on the south side of a house in New

82
00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:16.473
Mexico.

83
00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:17.030
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

84
00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:20.540
<v 0>When we huddled around together on the dark decks,</v>

85
00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:25.780
it was these little hopes and ambitions that made up the sum total of our worry

86
00:06:26.691 --> 00:06:31.691
at leaving rather than any visualization of physical agony to come.

87
00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:38.170
Very,
very accurate.

88
00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:43.443
<v 1>Now</v>

89
00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:46.930
<v 0>and I,
I,
I gotta say that with this book,</v>

90
00:06:46.931 --> 00:06:51.160
this is a fairly fairly thick book.
What do we got?

91
00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:56.410
Almost 500 pages and I have to burn through big chunks of it

92
00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:00.910
to get to some of the stuff that I wanted to cover.

93
00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:05.200
But there's a lot of very important detail in here.

94
00:07:05.290 --> 00:07:09.100
And one of the things that Ernie Pyle was known for was capturing what it was

95
00:07:09.101 --> 00:07:13.450
like,
not for the big general,
not for the big strip strategist,

96
00:07:13.870 --> 00:07:18.160
but what it was like to live every day as an,
as a grunt.

97
00:07:21.130 --> 00:07:24.930
So the invasion takes place and I think this was the,
uh,
they,

98
00:07:24.950 --> 00:07:29.950
they went into Italy and Ernie actually spent that invasion on the ship,

99
00:07:30.851 --> 00:07:33.340
the initial part of the invasion.
And then he goes ashore.

100
00:07:33.370 --> 00:07:35.290
And for whatever reason he gets sick.

101
00:07:35.950 --> 00:07:38.830
It's like sick ill,

102
00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:42.730
it doesn't get wounded but just gets ill and he ends up in a field hospital.

103
00:07:43.750 --> 00:07:44.240
<v 1>Okay.</v>

104
00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:45.440
<v 0>And we've had several,</v>

105
00:07:46.460 --> 00:07:51.460
several books take us into field hospitals and we know that they are a horrible,

106
00:07:51.501 --> 00:07:55.640
horrible place.
But there is,

107
00:07:57.060 --> 00:07:57.730
<v 1>yeah,</v>

108
00:07:57.730 --> 00:08:00.400
<v 0>some pretty glorious things that come out of those two.</v>

109
00:08:00.401 --> 00:08:01.390
And I'll go to the book here.

110
00:08:01.391 --> 00:08:06.391
It was flabbergasting to me to lie there and here wounded soldiers costs and

111
00:08:07.841 --> 00:08:10.570
begged to be sent right back to the fight.

112
00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:12.910
Of course not all of them did that.

113
00:08:13.060 --> 00:08:16.180
It depended on the severity of their wounds and on their individual

114
00:08:16.181 --> 00:08:18.550
personalities just as it wouldn't peace time,

115
00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:23.950
but at least a third of the less severely wounded men asked if they couldn't

116
00:08:23.951 --> 00:08:26.050
return to duty immediately.

117
00:08:30.150 --> 00:08:30.983
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

118
00:08:31.250 --> 00:08:33.020
<v 0>So all those fears that we just talked about.</v>

119
00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:37.550
And then you go into battle and you get wounded and the first thing you do when

120
00:08:37.551 --> 00:08:40.790
you get back to the aid station and say,
send me back to the front.

121
00:08:43.170 --> 00:08:44.000
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

122
00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:45.860
<v 0>He goes into a specific case here.</v>

123
00:08:46.070 --> 00:08:50.150
One big blonde infantry men had slight flesh wounds in the face and the back of

124
00:08:50.151 --> 00:08:50.960
his neck.

125
00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:54.500
He had a patch on his upper lip which prevented him from moving it and made him

126
00:08:54.501 --> 00:08:57.600
talk in a grave straight faced manner.
That was comical.

127
00:08:58.230 --> 00:09:00.720
I've never seen anybody so mad in my life.

128
00:09:00.750 --> 00:09:03.930
You went from one doctor to another trying to get somebody assigned his card,

129
00:09:03.931 --> 00:09:04.950
returning him to duty.

130
00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:08.370
The doctors explained patiently that if he returned to the front,

131
00:09:08.610 --> 00:09:12.960
his wounds become infected and he would be a burden to his company instead of a

132
00:09:12.961 --> 00:09:17.760
help.
They tried to entice him by telling him there would be nurses back in the

133
00:09:17.761 --> 00:09:20.760
hospital,
but it is peaceful Oklahoma drawl.

134
00:09:20.820 --> 00:09:24.720
He retorted to hell with the nurses.
I want to get back to fighting.

135
00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:32.260
Dying men were brought into our 10 men whose death rattle,

136
00:09:32.571 --> 00:09:35.510
silence the conversation and made us all thoughtful.

137
00:09:36.620 --> 00:09:38.330
When a man was almost gone,

138
00:09:38.570 --> 00:09:41.570
the surgeons would put a piece of gauze over his face.

139
00:09:42.290 --> 00:09:45.170
He could breathe through it,
but we couldn't see his face.

140
00:09:45.171 --> 00:09:49.820
Well twice within five minutes,
chaplains came running.

141
00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:52.820
One of those occasions haunted me for hours.

142
00:09:53.180 --> 00:09:55.700
The wounded man was still semi-conscious.

143
00:09:56.120 --> 00:10:00.650
The chaplain knelt down beside him and to ward boys squatted nearby.

144
00:10:01.490 --> 00:10:05.000
The chaplain said,
John,
I'm going to say a prayer for you.

145
00:10:06.470 --> 00:10:11.360
Somehow this stark announcement hit me like a hammer.
It didn't say,

146
00:10:11.361 --> 00:10:13.130
I'm going to pray for you to get well.

147
00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:18.280
He just said he was going to say a prayer and it was obvious to me that he meant

148
00:10:19.311 --> 00:10:20.210
a final prayer.

149
00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:26.500
He voiced the prayer and the weak gasping man tried vainly to repeat the words

150
00:10:26.871 --> 00:10:31.280
after him.
When he had finished the chaplain added,

151
00:10:31.700 --> 00:10:35.030
John,
you're doing fine.
You're doing fine.

152
00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:40.510
Then he rose and dashed off on some other call and the ward boys,

153
00:10:40.530 --> 00:10:42.110
when about their duties,

154
00:10:43.640 --> 00:10:47.450
the dying man was left utterly alone.

155
00:10:48.620 --> 00:10:51.350
Just lying there on his litter,
on the ground,

156
00:10:52.100 --> 00:10:54.440
lying in an aisle because the tent was full.

157
00:10:55.560 --> 00:10:56.370
<v 2>Okay.</v>

158
00:10:56.370 --> 00:10:58.080
<v 0>Of course it couldn't be otherwise,</v>

159
00:10:58.920 --> 00:11:02.970
but the aloneness of that man as he went through the last few minutes of his

160
00:11:02.971 --> 00:11:05.670
life was what tormented me.

161
00:11:06.730 --> 00:11:07.230
<v 2>Okay.</v>

162
00:11:07.230 --> 00:11:11.340
<v 0>I felt like going over and at least holding his hand while he died.</v>

163
00:11:12.170 --> 00:11:12.730
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

164
00:11:12.730 --> 00:11:16.510
<v 0>but it would have been out of order and I didn't do it.</v>

165
00:11:18.470 --> 00:11:20.510
I wish now I had,

166
00:11:28.450 --> 00:11:29.283
<v 2>yeah.</v>

167
00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:38.800
<v 0>In addition to talking about the infantry,</v>

168
00:11:40.730 --> 00:11:45.110
he also talks about the engineers and for those of you that don't know,

169
00:11:45.111 --> 00:11:50.111
engineers are basically military construction people that build things.

170
00:11:51.140 --> 00:11:56.140
They also do other like getting rid of minds and doing mine clearance.

171
00:11:56.201 --> 00:11:57.430
They do that often as well,

172
00:11:59.560 --> 00:12:00.393
<v 1>and</v>

173
00:12:02.180 --> 00:12:05.510
<v 0>we'll go back to the book.
During the latter days of the Sicilian campaign,</v>

174
00:12:05.511 --> 00:12:08.810
I spent all my time with combat engineers,
have two different divisions.

175
00:12:09.740 --> 00:12:12.290
The engineer's were in it up to their ears,

176
00:12:12.470 --> 00:12:14.870
scores of times during the Sicilian fighting.

177
00:12:15.110 --> 00:12:18.440
I heard everybody from generals to privates remark that this is certainly an

178
00:12:18.441 --> 00:12:23.441
engineer's war and indeed it was every foot of our advance upon the gradually

179
00:12:24.081 --> 00:12:28.580
withdrawing enemy was measured by the speed with which our engineers could open

180
00:12:28.581 --> 00:12:32.570
the highways,
clear the mines,
and bypass the blown bridges

181
00:12:34.190 --> 00:12:36.720
on this.
This was the same thing

182
00:12:37.790 --> 00:12:38.623
<v 1>that</v>

183
00:12:39.080 --> 00:12:43.320
<v 0>we,
we hadn't Ramadi the,
the engineers were just absolutely.</v>

184
00:12:44.610 --> 00:12:45.181
First of all,

185
00:12:45.181 --> 00:12:50.181
they were incredibly professional and their job was incredibly dangerous.

186
00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:52.850
They were clearing mines.
They were doing these building,

187
00:12:52.851 --> 00:12:56.980
these combat outposts and middle of the city,
are they armed the engineers,

188
00:12:57.030 --> 00:13:00.660
like in your case?
Yeah,
they are.
But you know,

189
00:13:00.990 --> 00:13:05.460
picture a guy that has to go in and move sand bags at the top of a building.

190
00:13:05.640 --> 00:13:08.780
He's,
he's carrying a 60 pound sandbag.

191
00:13:08.790 --> 00:13:13.650
He's got all of his gear on and,
and it's a semi protected area.

192
00:13:14.430 --> 00:13:17.100
Not fully protected,
but so a lot of times,
hey,
they're there.

193
00:13:17.130 --> 00:13:20.130
They might have a pistol on him,
but they're working their construction work.

194
00:13:20.131 --> 00:13:22.140
They're working construction.
Yup.
You don't.

195
00:13:22.170 --> 00:13:25.440
Now that doesn't mean that they're not also picking up security when they have

196
00:13:25.441 --> 00:13:28.260
to,
but man,
it's a,
it's a grueling,

197
00:13:28.590 --> 00:13:33.060
grueling job and in so incredibly dangerous and

198
00:13:34.060 --> 00:13:34.650
<v 1>okay.</v>

199
00:13:34.650 --> 00:13:39.300
<v 0>The book also talks about other pieces.
You know,
again,</v>

200
00:13:39.301 --> 00:13:41.190
we talked about infantry,
but there's other pieces.

201
00:13:41.191 --> 00:13:45.960
There's engineers who are doing all this building.
There's artillery,
which is,

202
00:13:46.020 --> 00:13:50.640
you know,
dropping bombs on the enemy.
And actually it was another,

203
00:13:51.450 --> 00:13:53.960
surprisingly,
there was art we utilized,

204
00:13:53.970 --> 00:13:57.780
they utilized artillery fairly significantly in Ramadi.

205
00:13:58.680 --> 00:14:03.300
<v 3>Yeah.
It's,
when you think about that,
like the engineers in a war zone,</v>

206
00:14:03.540 --> 00:14:06.210
right.
It's not like compared to like an MMA fight,
right.

207
00:14:06.211 --> 00:14:10.080
The cut man where he's like facilitating all these scenes,
giving water,
whatever.

208
00:14:10.081 --> 00:14:13.260
But that'd be tweeting rounds.
He's not part of the fight.
The engineer guys,

209
00:14:13.280 --> 00:14:16.290
the engineers,
they're going to get hit.
But here's the thing,

210
00:14:16.500 --> 00:14:19.110
they're not there specifically to fight.
Yeah,

211
00:14:19.530 --> 00:14:22.690
they're there to do some other stuff.
So it's like,
man,
they can get blindsided,

212
00:14:22.710 --> 00:14:26.010
like all that stuff.
It's incredibly,
and,
and yet,

213
00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:28.930
<v 0>you know,
you think,
oh,
it's an engineer's.
They're construction guys.</v>

214
00:14:29.040 --> 00:14:30.430
You maybe people don't,

215
00:14:30.490 --> 00:14:34.570
don't see them in the light of being legit combat warriors.

216
00:14:34.571 --> 00:14:39.571
And I'm here to tell you 100% without any shred of doubt.

217
00:14:40.060 --> 00:14:44.260
Those guys are hardcore combat warriors that have an incredibly tough job.

218
00:14:44.620 --> 00:14:49.620
And obviously the American engineers had been just outstanding World War II.

219
00:14:51.290 --> 00:14:53.120
I mean,
and when I saw them in Ramadi,

220
00:14:53.121 --> 00:14:57.560
they were a sight to behold without question.
And same thing,
like I said,

221
00:14:57.561 --> 00:15:00.380
I was talking about the artillery.
They used artillery unit in Ramadi,

222
00:15:00.660 --> 00:15:03.620
who as well,
which was,
which was,

223
00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:07.240
it was pretty cool for me.
Right.
Cause you know,

224
00:15:07.241 --> 00:15:11.860
I always grew up watching World War II movies and,
and you know,

225
00:15:11.920 --> 00:15:15.120
there I was in Ramadi,
man,
we had tanks out there in the streets,

226
00:15:15.610 --> 00:15:19.870
smashing through,
smashing through buildings and firing their main gun rounds.

227
00:15:19.871 --> 00:15:24.250
And then we had engineers out there rebuilding bridges and building combat

228
00:15:24.251 --> 00:15:25.084
outposts.

229
00:15:25.150 --> 00:15:30.150
And then we had artillery that was firing counter battery out in at the enemy

230
00:15:30.371 --> 00:15:31.840
that was shooting mortars at us.

231
00:15:31.841 --> 00:15:35.500
And at nighttime sometimes we'd fire illumination rounds,

232
00:15:35.501 --> 00:15:38.010
just like a big assault in a World War II.

233
00:15:39.800 --> 00:15:42.210
So it was very well I was,

234
00:15:42.390 --> 00:15:47.330
I feel very lucky to have been able to experience that,
that almost,

235
00:15:47.620 --> 00:15:49.550
you know,
World War II type feeling.
Now again,

236
00:15:49.551 --> 00:15:53.150
I'm not comparing anything that I did do a veteran from world war two by any

237
00:15:53.151 --> 00:15:57.200
stretch of the imagination,
but it was cool to get a little taste,

238
00:15:57.410 --> 00:15:59.630
just a little this,
a little taste of it,

239
00:15:59.840 --> 00:16:04.130
just a little taste of it and understand.
I mean,
I can't,
you know,
we were,

240
00:16:04.220 --> 00:16:04.940
you know,
the,

241
00:16:04.940 --> 00:16:09.710
the imagine fighting against other troops that were as well trained as you are,

242
00:16:09.711 --> 00:16:12.050
which is what you're doing in Germany when you're free,

243
00:16:12.051 --> 00:16:14.510
when you're invading France,
you're going against,
I mean,

244
00:16:14.990 --> 00:16:18.770
the insurgence there,
they're all hard fight.

245
00:16:18.771 --> 00:16:21.650
They're an enemy that I respect their capabilities,

246
00:16:22.640 --> 00:16:27.640
but they're not as well trained or as well organized or as well led as let's say

247
00:16:28.761 --> 00:16:33.590
the German army in World War II.
Right.
So it's a
tough enemy.

248
00:16:35.150 --> 00:16:39.230
And so as he continues through the book,
and as I said,

249
00:16:39.560 --> 00:16:44.560
this is a big thick book and I had to really be selective about what to call

250
00:16:45.741 --> 00:16:49.340
out.
And he talks about the various phases of the war.

251
00:16:49.341 --> 00:16:52.400
He talks a pretty big chunk about the air war,

252
00:16:54.400 --> 00:16:57.010
but really it's all leading towards

253
00:16:58.600 --> 00:17:01.330
one thing.
It's all leading towards one event.

254
00:17:01.331 --> 00:17:03.910
It's all leading towards one invasion.
And that's d day.

255
00:17:04.080 --> 00:17:04.913
<v 2>Hmm.</v>

256
00:17:06.090 --> 00:17:09.330
<v 0>And he spends time in England,
you know,</v>

257
00:17:09.331 --> 00:17:11.280
they're doing the preparation and they're having,

258
00:17:11.281 --> 00:17:14.790
they're doing what the Americans did in England when they were getting ready.

259
00:17:15.750 --> 00:17:20.750
And then finally they get the word that the mission is going to commence

260
00:17:24.010 --> 00:17:24.940
and we'll go to the book.

261
00:17:27.120 --> 00:17:32.100
We felt our chances were not very good and we were not happy about it.

262
00:17:32.910 --> 00:17:37.910
Men like dawn Whitehead and Clark Lee who had been through the mill so long and

263
00:17:38.401 --> 00:17:41.970
so boldly began to get nerves.

264
00:17:42.750 --> 00:17:46.200
Frankly,
I was the worst of the lot and continued to be.

265
00:17:47.250 --> 00:17:52.250
I began having terrible of depression and often would dream hideous dreams all

266
00:17:55.081 --> 00:17:59.190
the time.
Fear,
lay Blackley deep upon our consciousness.

267
00:17:59.670 --> 00:18:02.850
It board down on our hearts like an all consuming weight.

268
00:18:03.120 --> 00:18:08.120
People would talk to us and we wouldn't want to hear what they were saying of

269
00:18:08.310 --> 00:18:13.140
those.
Again,
those are the correspondence.
Those were the war correspondence.

270
00:18:13.141 --> 00:18:16.060
That's the guy who he's talking about when they,
when they bring them together,

271
00:18:16.140 --> 00:18:21.140
they're talking like a squad or a platoon of war correspondents and they are

272
00:18:21.601 --> 00:18:23.550
scared to death.

273
00:18:25.810 --> 00:18:30.730
The army said they were trying to give us 24 hours notice of departure.
Actually,

274
00:18:30.731 --> 00:18:34.480
the call came at nine o'clock one morning and we were ordered to be in a certain

275
00:18:34.481 --> 00:18:39.481
place with full field kit at 10:30 AM we threw our stuff stuff together.

276
00:18:42.290 --> 00:18:44.930
Probably a smart way to do it,
you know,
hey,

277
00:18:44.931 --> 00:18:47.990
we'll give you 24 hours advanced notice,
don't worry.
You know,
we'll let you know,

278
00:18:48.260 --> 00:18:52.910
hey,
reporting an hour cause cause,
and he tells he's going to talk about this.

279
00:18:53.480 --> 00:18:57.410
The waiting isn't,
is not good.
That is,

280
00:18:57.440 --> 00:19:01.190
that is the stress part.
And it's the same thing with everything.

281
00:19:01.220 --> 00:19:02.810
Anything that you actually,

282
00:19:03.140 --> 00:19:05.960
you'll look at Jujitsu tournament when you're waiting to compete.

283
00:19:06.080 --> 00:19:09.470
That's the worst part.
Once you won't,
you go,
okay,

284
00:19:09.471 --> 00:19:13.090
your mind is free and you're just doing what you do even during a workout.
Yeah.

285
00:19:13.580 --> 00:19:17.480
If you've got a hard workout that you're going to do,
you're dreading it.

286
00:19:17.780 --> 00:19:21.860
And I do this.
I'll be like for like if I have squats,
I'm sitting there,

287
00:19:21.861 --> 00:19:24.410
I'll make all kinds of what maybe I need to stretch a little bit more.

288
00:19:24.820 --> 00:19:28.190
You know what,
let me just grab a little bit more water and uh,

289
00:19:28.640 --> 00:19:31.730
and then let me check the lineup of the music that's going to play and just make

290
00:19:31.731 --> 00:19:33.920
sure that that's good to go.
And hold on was this,

291
00:19:33.950 --> 00:19:36.830
is this bumper plate look straight.
I'm going to straighten that out.

292
00:19:36.831 --> 00:19:39.410
So you just sit there and having hall and then finally you walk over,

293
00:19:39.830 --> 00:19:40.910
you press your press,

294
00:19:40.911 --> 00:19:43.880
your start in your stock stopwatch and then there's no stopping.

295
00:19:43.881 --> 00:19:48.881
You just go and it half an hour later the deed is done,

296
00:19:49.160 --> 00:19:53.570
you know,
but the waiting.
Yup.
Yeah.
If it's going down,

297
00:19:53.571 --> 00:19:54.980
let's get it over with kind of thing.

298
00:19:55.220 --> 00:19:57.920
You know what this is that Shakespeare quote that I read one time when here that

299
00:19:57.921 --> 00:20:02.921
that moment in between taking the action and when you think of the action and

300
00:20:03.141 --> 00:20:06.590
when you take the action,
that moment is an eternity best.

301
00:20:08.210 --> 00:20:11.810
So you got to close the distance on that thing,
which is exactly what they did.

302
00:20:11.930 --> 00:20:13.880
Oh,
we'll give you 24 hours.
Nowhere in closed the distance.

303
00:20:13.881 --> 00:20:17.120
You've got an hour and a half here with your gear ready to get it on

304
00:20:18.730 --> 00:20:22.900
back to the book.
Bill Stoneman,
another correspondent who had been wounded once,

305
00:20:22.901 --> 00:20:26.740
never showed the slightest concern whether he felt any concern or not.

306
00:20:26.741 --> 00:20:30.550
I could not tell bill had a humorous,
sardonic manner.

307
00:20:30.700 --> 00:20:33.640
While we were waiting for the departure into the unknown,

308
00:20:33.970 --> 00:20:35.560
he took out a pencil and a notebook.

309
00:20:35.590 --> 00:20:36.423
<v 1>Okay.</v>

310
00:20:37.500 --> 00:20:40.560
<v 0>As though starting to interview me,
tell me,
Mr Pile,</v>

311
00:20:40.561 --> 00:20:45.300
how does it feel to be an assault correspondent?
Being a man of few words,

312
00:20:45.870 --> 00:20:48.550
I said,
it feels awful.

313
00:20:52.780 --> 00:20:57.780
We had hardly got a board when the lines were cast off and we pulled out that

314
00:20:58.391 --> 00:20:59.110
evening.

315
00:20:59.110 --> 00:21:03.580
The colonel commanding the troops on our ship gave me the whole invasion plan in

316
00:21:03.581 --> 00:21:08.250
detail.
The secret,
the whole world had waited years to here.

317
00:21:08.640 --> 00:21:11.970
Once a man had heard it,
it became permanently part of it.

318
00:21:12.270 --> 00:21:15.780
He became permanently part of it.
Then he was committed.

319
00:21:16.380 --> 00:21:20.100
It was too late to back out,
even if his heart failed him.

320
00:21:21.570 --> 00:21:25.980
I asked a good many questions.
I realized my voice was shaking when I spoke,

321
00:21:25.981 --> 00:21:30.030
but I couldn't help it.
Yes,
it will be tough to colonel admitted,

322
00:21:30.031 --> 00:21:33.000
admitted our own part would be precarious.

323
00:21:33.420 --> 00:21:36.330
He hoped to go in with his few cash pleased as possible,

324
00:21:36.840 --> 00:21:38.640
but there would be casualties

325
00:21:40.530 --> 00:21:42.930
from a vague anticipatory dread.

326
00:21:43.080 --> 00:21:48.080
The invasion now turned into a horrible reality for me in a matter of hours.

327
00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:52.350
The holocaust of our own planning would swirl over us.

328
00:21:53.100 --> 00:21:57.570
No Man could guarantee his own fate.
It was almost too much for me,

329
00:21:58.610 --> 00:22:02.190
a feeling of utter desperation obsessed me throughout the night.

330
00:22:02.460 --> 00:22:07.460
It was nearly 4:00 AM before I got to sleep and then it was a sleep harassed and

331
00:22:07.861 --> 00:22:10.920
torn by an awful knowledge.

332
00:22:15.530 --> 00:22:16.363
<v 2>Okay.</v>

333
00:22:17.670 --> 00:22:22.670
<v 0>My devastating sense of fear and depression disappeared when we approached the</v>

334
00:22:23.731 --> 00:22:24.564
beach head.

335
00:22:26.290 --> 00:22:30.550
There was the old familiar crack and ruler of big guns all around us and the

336
00:22:30.551 --> 00:22:34.870
shore was a great brown haze of smoke and dust and we knew that the bombers

337
00:22:34.871 --> 00:22:38.410
would be over us that night.
Yet all the haunting premonition,

338
00:22:38.560 --> 00:22:41.380
the soul consuming dread was gone.

339
00:22:42.430 --> 00:22:47.430
The war was presented to me again and I believe that was true of everyone,

340
00:22:48.071 --> 00:22:52.660
a board,
even those who had never been in combat before.
So again,

341
00:22:52.661 --> 00:22:54.190
once this gig kicks off,

342
00:22:55.660 --> 00:22:59.230
all that horror is gone and now it's time to get the job done.

343
00:22:59.950 --> 00:23:04.950
So when you're out there in the world and you're feeling that dread and you're

344
00:23:05.501 --> 00:23:10.090
feeling that hesitation,
just step,
go,
Yup.

345
00:23:10.480 --> 00:23:12.970
It's not helping you to sit around and be nervous.

346
00:23:13.090 --> 00:23:16.600
It's not helping you to to see if he needed a little sip of water before we

347
00:23:16.601 --> 00:23:19.780
start doing what you're doing.
Yeah.
There's bad news to deliver on your business.

348
00:23:19.781 --> 00:23:23.830
There's no sense in doing another pace lap outside though the room where people

349
00:23:23.831 --> 00:23:27.820
are waiting to hear from you,
get in and get it going.

350
00:23:32.120 --> 00:23:32.960
Now he,

351
00:23:33.020 --> 00:23:38.020
he does a great job here telling about how hard this actually was.

352
00:23:40.580 --> 00:23:43.580
Cause you know,
we'd go,
Oh d day.
Yeah,
we,
oh yeah,
it was a tough fight.

353
00:23:45.050 --> 00:23:46.160
Here's some detail on that.

354
00:23:47.810 --> 00:23:51.320
I want to tell you what the opening of the second front in that one sector

355
00:23:51.321 --> 00:23:55.550
entailed so that you can know and appreciate and forever be humbly grateful to

356
00:23:55.551 --> 00:23:59.300
those both dead and alive.
Who did it for you.

357
00:24:00.390 --> 00:24:01.200
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

358
00:24:01.200 --> 00:24:06.100
<v 0>Ashore facing us wore more enemy troops than we had in our assault waves.</v>

359
00:24:06.820 --> 00:24:10.780
The advantages,
we're all,
there's the disadvantages.
All ours,

360
00:24:11.590 --> 00:24:15.640
the Germans were dug into positions they had been working on for months,

361
00:24:16.090 --> 00:24:20.980
although they were not entirely complete.
A 100 foot bluff,

362
00:24:21.010 --> 00:24:23.380
a couple of hundred yards back from the beach,

363
00:24:23.920 --> 00:24:28.540
had had great concrete gun emplacements built right into the hilltop.

364
00:24:29.260 --> 00:24:31.300
These open to the sides instead of the front,

365
00:24:31.330 --> 00:24:34.990
thus making it hard for naval fire from the seed to reach them.

366
00:24:35.590 --> 00:24:39.850
They could shoot parallel to the shore and cover every foot of it from miles

367
00:24:39.851 --> 00:24:44.240
with artillery.
Fire a hundred foot cliff.
By the way,

368
00:24:45.170 --> 00:24:47.160
just don't,
let's not even worry about the enemy.

369
00:24:47.161 --> 00:24:51.770
A hundred foot cliff after you come out of the water.
That's what you're facing.

370
00:24:52.400 --> 00:24:55.760
Then you put in pill boxes and you put Germans in those pillboxes by the way.

371
00:24:55.761 --> 00:24:57.500
More Germans than there are Americans.

372
00:24:59.060 --> 00:24:59.730
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

373
00:24:59.730 --> 00:25:02.640
<v 0>it's a nightmare.
Back to the book.</v>

374
00:25:03.330 --> 00:25:07.520
Then they had hidden machine gun nest on the forward slopes with crossfire

375
00:25:07.530 --> 00:25:09.810
taking in every inch of the beach.

376
00:25:10.200 --> 00:25:13.710
These nests were connected by networks of trenches so that the German gunners

377
00:25:13.711 --> 00:25:17.730
could move about without exposing themselves throughout the length of the beach

378
00:25:17.731 --> 00:25:20.580
running zig zag a couple of hundred yards back from the shoreline.

379
00:25:20.581 --> 00:25:25.350
What is an immense V's shape ditch 15 feet deep.
Nothing could cross it,

380
00:25:25.560 --> 00:25:30.560
not even men on foot until it feel until fills had been made and in other places

381
00:25:30.571 --> 00:25:35.220
at the forum of the beach where the ground was flatter,
they had concrete walls.

382
00:25:35.970 --> 00:25:39.360
These were blasted by our naval gunfire or buy explosives by hand.

383
00:25:39.361 --> 00:25:40.440
After we got a shore,

384
00:25:41.530 --> 00:25:44.590
our only exits from the beach where several swales or valleys,

385
00:25:44.591 --> 00:25:46.420
each one about a hundred yards wide,

386
00:25:47.350 --> 00:25:51.490
the Germans made the most of those funnel light traps sewing them with buried

387
00:25:51.491 --> 00:25:52.324
minds.

388
00:25:53.050 --> 00:25:58.030
They also contained barbed wire entanglements with mines attached hidden ditches

389
00:25:58.210 --> 00:26:00.760
and machine guns firing from the slopes.

390
00:26:03.050 --> 00:26:06.200
This is just,
it's,
it's,
it's unbelievable.

391
00:26:06.890 --> 00:26:11.890
It's unbelievable the amount of defenses that were in placed and the fact that

392
00:26:12.711 --> 00:26:16.880
we pushed through it,
and I humbly use the term we

393
00:26:20.240 --> 00:26:21.710
all this was done on the shore,

394
00:26:22.250 --> 00:26:27.250
but our men had to go through a maze nearly as deadly before the even goddess

395
00:26:28.391 --> 00:26:32.520
shore.
Underwater obstacles were terrific under the water.

396
00:26:32.521 --> 00:26:36.090
The Germans had whole fields of evil devices to catch our boats.

397
00:26:36.420 --> 00:26:37.830
Several days after landing.

398
00:26:37.831 --> 00:26:41.400
We had cleared only channels through them and still could not approach to the

399
00:26:41.401 --> 00:26:44.190
whole length of the beach with our ships.
Even then,

400
00:26:44.191 --> 00:26:47.700
some ship or boat would hit one of those minds and be knocked out of commission.

401
00:26:49.020 --> 00:26:51.630
The Germans had masses of great six prongs.

402
00:26:51.631 --> 00:26:56.100
Spiders made of railroad iron and standing shoulder high just beneath the

403
00:26:56.101 --> 00:26:59.010
surface of the water for our landing craft to run into.

404
00:26:59.870 --> 00:27:00.050
<v 2>Okay.</v>

405
00:27:00.050 --> 00:27:03.470
<v 0>They had huge logs buried in the sand pointing upward and outward.</v>

406
00:27:03.471 --> 00:27:08.471
Their tops just below the water attached to the logs were mines.

407
00:27:10.460 --> 00:27:11.900
In addition to these obstacles,

408
00:27:11.901 --> 00:27:15.770
they had floating minds off shore landmines buried in the sand of the beach and

409
00:27:15.771 --> 00:27:19.670
more mines checkerboard in checkerboard rose in the tall grass.
Beyond the sand.

410
00:27:20.690 --> 00:27:25.580
The and the enemy had four men on shore for every three men we had approaching

411
00:27:25.581 --> 00:27:29.900
the shore
and yet we got on.

412
00:27:32.350 --> 00:27:33.183
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

413
00:27:33.600 --> 00:27:38.220
<v 0>Going against a defended position is so very difficult.</v>

414
00:27:39.330 --> 00:27:40.470
The odds.
Well,

415
00:27:40.471 --> 00:27:45.240
in in doctrinally in urban warfare,

416
00:27:45.330 --> 00:27:48.840
you're supposed to have 10 men for every one defender,

417
00:27:50.040 --> 00:27:53.790
10 men for every one defender.
And here we weren't out outmanned

418
00:27:55.290 --> 00:27:57.780
against a heavily defended before to find position.

419
00:28:00.620 --> 00:28:03.980
So how do you do it?
Well,
back to the book,
as one officer said,

420
00:28:03.981 --> 00:28:07.310
the only way to take a beach is to face it and keep going.

421
00:28:08.180 --> 00:28:10.850
It is costly at first,
but that is the only way.

422
00:28:11.930 --> 00:28:15.110
If the men are pinned down on the beach,
dug in and out of action,

423
00:28:15.350 --> 00:28:17.000
they made as well,
not be there at all.

424
00:28:17.210 --> 00:28:21.170
They hold up the waves behind them and nothing is being gained.

425
00:28:22.500 --> 00:28:22.990
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

426
00:28:22.990 --> 00:28:26.610
<v 0>So art of war,
Sun Tzu attack.
What?
Guess what you get?</v>

427
00:28:26.700 --> 00:28:29.590
There's only one way to do this.
You gotta do it.

428
00:28:35.730 --> 00:28:36.563
<v 2>Okay.</v>

429
00:28:36.950 --> 00:28:38.030
<v 0>Now he talks about</v>

430
00:28:39.920 --> 00:28:44.920
as the carnage after the,

431
00:28:44.971 --> 00:28:47.370
after the initial beachhead had been taken,

432
00:28:47.640 --> 00:28:50.490
he talks about some of the carnage that remains there

433
00:28:52.410 --> 00:28:54.930
in this shoreline museum of carnage.

434
00:28:55.230 --> 00:28:59.580
There were abandoned rolls of barbed wire and smashed boulder dozers and big

435
00:28:59.581 --> 00:29:03.720
stacks of thrown away lifebelts and piles of shells still waiting to be moved

436
00:29:04.680 --> 00:29:09.120
in.
The water floated empty life rafts and soldiers packs and and boxes and

437
00:29:09.121 --> 00:29:13.590
mysterious oranges on the beach lay snored,

438
00:29:13.591 --> 00:29:18.270
rolls of telephone wire and big rolls of steel matting and stacks of broken

439
00:29:18.540 --> 00:29:20.010
rusting rifles.

440
00:29:21.270 --> 00:29:21.910
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

441
00:29:21.910 --> 00:29:24.670
<v 0>but there was another and more human litter.</v>

442
00:29:25.820 --> 00:29:28.060
It extended in a thin little line,

443
00:29:28.390 --> 00:29:31.660
just like a high watermark for miles along the beach.

444
00:29:32.320 --> 00:29:36.790
This was the strewn personal gear gear that would never be needed again by those

445
00:29:36.791 --> 00:29:39.970
who fought and died to give us our entrance into Europe.

446
00:29:40.990 --> 00:29:41.750
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

447
00:29:41.750 --> 00:29:45.650
<v 0>they're in a jumbled role for mile one mile.</v>

448
00:29:46.010 --> 00:29:50.930
We're soldiers packs.
There were socks and shoe Polish,
sewing kits,

449
00:29:50.931 --> 00:29:54.020
diaries,
bibles,
hands,
Gurney,
hand grenades.

450
00:29:54.620 --> 00:29:58.580
There were the latest letters from home with the address on each one neatly

451
00:29:58.581 --> 00:29:59.414
razor it out.

452
00:29:59.870 --> 00:30:03.950
One of the security precautious enforced before the boys embarked,

453
00:30:04.770 --> 00:30:09.620
there were toothbrushes and razors and snapshots of families back home staring

454
00:30:09.621 --> 00:30:14.340
up at you from the sand.
There were pocketbooks,

455
00:30:14.660 --> 00:30:19.460
metal mirrors,
extra trousers and bloody abandoned shoes.

456
00:30:20.420 --> 00:30:24.980
There were broken handled shovels and portable radio smashed almost beyond

457
00:30:24.981 --> 00:30:28.880
recognition and mine detectors twisted and ruined.

458
00:30:30.170 --> 00:30:33.800
There were torn pistol belts and canvas water buckets,

459
00:30:33.890 --> 00:30:37.760
first aid kits and jumbled heaps of life belts.

460
00:30:38.840 --> 00:30:43.310
I picked up a pocket Bible with a soldier's name in it and put it in my jacket.

461
00:30:44.360 --> 00:30:49.280
I carried it half a mile or so and then put it back down on the beach.

462
00:30:50.780 --> 00:30:55.370
I don't know why I picked it up or why put it down again.

463
00:30:56.510 --> 00:31:01.510
Soldiers carry strange things with them ashore in every invasion.

464
00:31:03.201 --> 00:31:07.010
There's at least one soldier hitting the beach at eight h hour with a Banjo

465
00:31:07.011 --> 00:31:11.510
slung over his shoulder.
The most ironic piece of equipment marking our beach,

466
00:31:11.630 --> 00:31:14.450
the first this beach,
first of despair.

467
00:31:14.451 --> 00:31:19.451
Then a victory was a tennis racket that some soldier had brought along the lay

468
00:31:19.941 --> 00:31:24.890
lonesome Lee on the sand clamped and it's press,
not a string broken.

469
00:31:26.200 --> 00:31:30.640
Two of the most dominant items on the beach.
Refuse in the beach.

470
00:31:30.641 --> 00:31:34.090
Refuse were cigarettes and writing paper.

471
00:31:34.870 --> 00:31:39.870
Each soldier was issued a carton of cigarettes just before he started that day,

472
00:31:40.481 --> 00:31:43.930
those cartons by the thousand water soaked and spilled out.

473
00:31:44.200 --> 00:31:46.840
Mark the line of our first savage blow.

474
00:31:47.710 --> 00:31:48.270
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

475
00:31:48.270 --> 00:31:51.510
<v 0>writing paper and air mail envelopes came second.</v>

476
00:31:52.470 --> 00:31:55.350
The boys and tended to do a lot of writing in France.

477
00:31:56.800 --> 00:32:01.800
Imagine the letters now forever incapable of being written that might have

478
00:32:02.651 --> 00:32:05.530
filled those blank abandoned pages.

479
00:32:15.820 --> 00:32:16.653
Now

480
00:32:18.550 --> 00:32:23.550
talking a little bit about the German prisoners as they start to roll up German

481
00:32:23.711 --> 00:32:28.300
prisoners.
Some of the German officers,
we're pleased at being captured,

482
00:32:28.810 --> 00:32:32.650
but the died in the WWE,
but the dyed in the wool Nazi was not.

483
00:32:33.250 --> 00:32:35.260
They brought in a young one who is furious.

484
00:32:35.440 --> 00:32:39.100
He considered it thoroughly unethical for us to fight so hard.

485
00:32:41.090 --> 00:32:43.820
That's right.
Did you heard what I said?

486
00:32:43.910 --> 00:32:47.900
He thought it was unethical how hard the Americans fought.

487
00:32:49.580 --> 00:32:53.750
The Americans had attacked all night and the Germans don't like a night attacks

488
00:32:54.300 --> 00:32:59.120
were coming to get you,
and this special fellow was brought in.

489
00:32:59.780 --> 00:33:02.840
When the special fellow was brought in,
he protested in rage.
You Americans,

490
00:33:02.841 --> 00:33:06.380
the way you fight that is,
this is not war.
This is madness.

491
00:33:07.520 --> 00:33:11.150
The German was so outraged.
She never even got the irony of his own remarks.

492
00:33:11.570 --> 00:33:14.930
That madness though it were.
It worked.

493
00:33:17.420 --> 00:33:21.260
Another high ranking officer was brought in and the first thing he asked was the

494
00:33:21.261 --> 00:33:26.180
whereabouts of his personal orderly when told that is orderly was deader than a

495
00:33:26.181 --> 00:33:27.014
mackerel.

496
00:33:27.410 --> 00:33:31.730
He flew off the handle and accused us of depriving him of his personal comfort.

497
00:33:32.240 --> 00:33:34.250
Who's going to dig my foxhole for me?

498
00:33:34.251 --> 00:33:39.251
He demanded a little German aristocracy going on in the ranks,

499
00:33:40.490 --> 00:33:43.100
but what a,
what a testament.

500
00:33:43.220 --> 00:33:46.220
You always just kind of talking about how tough the Germans were,

501
00:33:46.250 --> 00:33:51.200
which they certainly were,
but here's the German saying,
good.
Lowered.

502
00:33:51.590 --> 00:33:55.310
It's unethical that you fight this hard.
That's right.

503
00:33:56.670 --> 00:34:00.890
Red.
The Germans thought they were rolling light,
you know,
you know,
hey,

504
00:34:00.891 --> 00:34:03.170
let's roll later.
And the Americans were like,
Nah,

505
00:34:03.171 --> 00:34:07.580
we're going ADCC style or you don't know it's on the world championships.
Yeah.

506
00:34:07.790 --> 00:34:12.380
Literally.
Yeah,
we're really happy jokes.
I always uh,

507
00:34:13.220 --> 00:34:14.930
you know,
American,

508
00:34:14.990 --> 00:34:18.410
the American fighting spirit is a powerful,

509
00:34:18.411 --> 00:34:23.150
powerful force and sometimes people don't recognize that because you know what,

510
00:34:23.480 --> 00:34:25.490
we're living here pretty good.
And even back then,

511
00:34:25.940 --> 00:34:27.200
now we're coming out of the depression.

512
00:34:28.040 --> 00:34:30.590
So you did have some hard back in America,

513
00:34:32.090 --> 00:34:35.990
but you can trace that pre depression Americans fight hard.

514
00:34:37.420 --> 00:34:38.000
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

515
00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:41.150
<v 0>There's no doubt about it.
And I can,</v>

516
00:34:41.870 --> 00:34:46.870
I've personally personally witnessed the spirit of the American soldier and it

517
00:34:48.321 --> 00:34:49.820
is a damn impressive thing

518
00:34:53.770 --> 00:34:54.700
going to get into some,

519
00:34:55.750 --> 00:34:59.210
well the name of the chapter here is street fighting.

520
00:35:01.240 --> 00:35:01.870
One of,

521
00:35:01.870 --> 00:35:06.870
one of the favorite generals among war correspondence was major general Manton s

522
00:35:07.360 --> 00:35:08.890
Eddie Commander of the ninth division.

523
00:35:09.160 --> 00:35:14.160
We liked him because he was absolutely honest with us because he was sort of an

524
00:35:14.380 --> 00:35:19.210
old shoe and easy to talk with him because we thought he was a mighty good

525
00:35:19.211 --> 00:35:23.410
general,
General Ed.
He looked more like a school teacher,
then a soldier.

526
00:35:23.950 --> 00:35:27.100
He was a big tall man.
But he wore glasses in his eyes,

527
00:35:27.570 --> 00:35:32.380
had a sort of squint being a widow Midwesterner.
He talked like one,

528
00:35:32.950 --> 00:35:37.150
he still claims Chicago is home,
although he'd been an army officer for 28 years.

529
00:35:37.650 --> 00:35:37.980
He was

530
00:35:37.980 --> 00:35:40.830
<v 4>wounded in the last war.
He was not Glib,</v>

531
00:35:41.460 --> 00:35:46.050
but he talked well and laughed easily.
In spite of being a professional soldier,

532
00:35:46.320 --> 00:35:51.320
he despised war and like in any ordinary soul was appalled by the waist and

533
00:35:51.901 --> 00:35:52.830
tragedy of it.

534
00:35:53.730 --> 00:35:58.470
He wanted to win and get home just as badly as anybody else.

535
00:36:01.100 --> 00:36:04.580
General Eddie especially like to show up in places where it's soldiers wouldn't

536
00:36:04.581 --> 00:36:07.850
expect to see him.
Little leadership lessons right now from General Eddie,

537
00:36:08.030 --> 00:36:10.790
nothing wrong with smiling,
talking with the boys,

538
00:36:10.791 --> 00:36:13.430
no one what's going on and then boom,

539
00:36:13.880 --> 00:36:16.730
show up in places where his soldiers wouldn't expect to see him.

540
00:36:17.060 --> 00:36:20.450
He knew it helped the soldiers spirits to see their commanding general right up

541
00:36:20.451 --> 00:36:22.010
there at the front where it was hot.

542
00:36:22.760 --> 00:36:25.250
So we walked around the front with his long stride,

543
00:36:25.550 --> 00:36:28.460
never ducking or appearing to be concerned at all.

544
00:36:29.690 --> 00:36:32.660
One day I rode around with him on one of his tours.

545
00:36:32.661 --> 00:36:36.140
We stopped at a command post and we're sitting on the grass under a tree looking

546
00:36:36.141 --> 00:36:38.300
at maps with a group of officers around us.

547
00:36:38.810 --> 00:36:43.160
Our own military was near banging nearby,
but nothing was coming our way.

548
00:36:43.640 --> 00:36:48.320
Then like a flash of lightening there came Michelle just over our heads so low.

549
00:36:48.321 --> 00:36:51.710
It went right through the tree tops.
It seemed,
it didn't whine.

550
00:36:51.711 --> 00:36:54.140
It wished it squished.

551
00:36:54.590 --> 00:36:58.670
Everybody including full colonels flopped over and begin grabbing grass.

552
00:36:59.240 --> 00:37:03.410
The shell exploded in the next orchard.
General Ed,
he didn't move.

553
00:37:04.040 --> 00:37:06.800
He just said that was one of our shells.

554
00:37:08.110 --> 00:37:08.500
<v 2>Okay.</v>

555
00:37:08.500 --> 00:37:13.500
<v 4>The general also like to get up at four o'clock in the morning once in a while,</v>

556
00:37:13.720 --> 00:37:16.930
to go poking around into the message.
Genders in mess halls,

557
00:37:17.200 --> 00:37:18.460
given the boys a start.

558
00:37:19.690 --> 00:37:20.370
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

559
00:37:20.370 --> 00:37:22.100
<v 4>It sounds like he was a little bit an early riser.</v>

560
00:37:22.840 --> 00:37:25.730
It's trying to be up before the enemy is definitely up before the enemy.
Well,

561
00:37:25.731 --> 00:37:29.300
apparently,
you know the Germans,
they were saying,
hey,
your nighttime.
Yeah,
yeah,

562
00:37:29.720 --> 00:37:30.553
yeah.

563
00:37:33.260 --> 00:37:35.090
During the sheer board peninsula campaign.

564
00:37:35.091 --> 00:37:37.880
I spent nine days with the Ninth Infantry Division,

565
00:37:37.881 --> 00:37:42.881
the division that cut the peninsula and one of the three that overwhelmed the

566
00:37:43.011 --> 00:37:44.450
great port of share Moose.

567
00:37:46.140 --> 00:37:48.330
The ninth is one of our best divisions.

568
00:37:48.450 --> 00:37:51.180
It landed in Africa and fall through Tunisia and Sicily.

569
00:37:51.520 --> 00:37:54.780
Then it went to England in the fall of 1943 and trained all winter for the

570
00:37:54.781 --> 00:37:59.781
invasion of France was one of the American divisions in the invasion that had

571
00:38:00.030 --> 00:38:01.890
previous battle experience.

572
00:38:02.910 --> 00:38:07.380
The ninth did something in that campaign that we hadn't always done in the past.

573
00:38:07.650 --> 00:38:10.380
It kept tenaciously on the enemy's neck.

574
00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:15.360
When the Germans grew,
withdraw little,
the ninth was right on top of them.

575
00:38:15.960 --> 00:38:18.840
It never gave them a chance to reassemble or get their balance.

576
00:38:19.080 --> 00:38:21.390
The ninth moves so fast.
It got to be funny.

577
00:38:21.990 --> 00:38:25.680
I was based at the division command post and we struck our tents and move

578
00:38:25.681 --> 00:38:30.210
forward six times in seven days that work the daylights out of the boys who took

579
00:38:30.211 --> 00:38:33.630
down and put up the tents.
I overheard one of the boys saying,

580
00:38:33.631 --> 00:38:35.590
I'd rather be with Ringling brothers,

581
00:38:38.890 --> 00:38:41.920
but that's a little strategic importance there.

582
00:38:43.060 --> 00:38:46.240
The ninth was just,
Oh,
oh,
we're,
we're,

583
00:38:46.241 --> 00:38:48.880
we're going to get you and we're going to come after you and we're not going to

584
00:38:48.881 --> 00:38:51.940
stop.
You're not going to get a chance to recover and not get a chance to rest.

585
00:38:52.540 --> 00:38:56.680
Sometimes you've got to go in that mode no matter what what you're doing in
life.

586
00:38:56.980 --> 00:38:58.120
Sometimes you got to go in that mode.

587
00:38:58.870 --> 00:39:01.480
You don't back off and I'll tell you what you want to arrest.

588
00:39:01.750 --> 00:39:05.680
People want to rest,
but sometimes you can't.

589
00:39:06.190 --> 00:39:10.540
Sometimes you need to keep the pressure on
kind of like you and Twitter.

590
00:39:11.020 --> 00:39:13.060
Yes.
Had to keep some pressure on

591
00:39:15.100 --> 00:39:17.020
one day I went along quite accidentally.

592
00:39:17.021 --> 00:39:19.750
I assure you with an infantry company that had been assigned to clean out a

593
00:39:19.751 --> 00:39:24.751
pocket in the suburbs of share boomers since the episode was typically of the

594
00:39:25.451 --> 00:39:29.950
way an infantry advanced into the city,
held by a by an enemy.

595
00:39:30.190 --> 00:39:33.480
I would like to try and give you a picture of it so he's going to try and like

596
00:39:33.490 --> 00:39:34.900
explain what that was like.

597
00:39:35.620 --> 00:39:40.620
The soldiers around us had two weeks growth of beard and before he talks about

598
00:39:41.171 --> 00:39:41.461
the assault,

599
00:39:41.461 --> 00:39:44.410
he kind of gives you a little update on this other than the front line in

600
00:39:44.411 --> 00:39:47.830
between troops.
The soldiers around us had two weeks growth of beard.

601
00:39:48.400 --> 00:39:52.330
Their uniforms were worn,
worn,
slick and very dirty.

602
00:39:52.390 --> 00:39:55.210
The uncomfortable gas impregnated close.

603
00:39:55.780 --> 00:39:58.630
They'd come assurance con come ashore in.

604
00:39:59.680 --> 00:40:01.060
The boys were tired.

605
00:40:01.540 --> 00:40:05.410
They had been fighting and moving constantly forward on foot for nearly three

606
00:40:05.411 --> 00:40:09.520
weeks without rest,
sleeping on the ground wet most of the time.

607
00:40:09.550 --> 00:40:12.940
Always tents,
eating cold rations,
seeing their friends die.

608
00:40:15.080 --> 00:40:18.890
One of them came up to me and said,
almost belligerently,

609
00:40:19.190 --> 00:40:21.680
why don't you tell the folks back home what this is like.

610
00:40:22.490 --> 00:40:26.000
All they hear about his victories and a lot of the glory stuff,

611
00:40:26.900 --> 00:40:31.250
they don't know that for every hundred yards we advance,
somebody gets killed.

612
00:40:31.370 --> 00:40:34.040
Why don't you tell them how tough this life is?

613
00:40:35.690 --> 00:40:37.790
I told him that I tried to do that all the time.

614
00:40:38.330 --> 00:40:41.030
This fellow was pretty fed up with it all.

615
00:40:41.870 --> 00:40:45.170
He said he didn't see why his outfit wasn't sent home.

616
00:40:45.320 --> 00:40:46.760
They had done all the fighting.

617
00:40:48.090 --> 00:40:51.870
That wasn't true at all for their one other divisions that had fought more and

618
00:40:51.871 --> 00:40:53.550
taking heavier casualties.

619
00:40:54.510 --> 00:40:58.860
Exhaustion will make a man feel like that a few days.

620
00:40:58.861 --> 00:41:02.250
Rest usually has him smiling again.

621
00:41:03.870 --> 00:41:05.910
You know,
and we've heard this time and time again,

622
00:41:05.970 --> 00:41:08.490
sometimes you start get that mental fatigue.

623
00:41:08.491 --> 00:41:10.440
You've got to take a little breather.
So yeah,

624
00:41:10.470 --> 00:41:12.960
like the ninth sometimes you've got to keep the pressure on,

625
00:41:13.170 --> 00:41:16.890
but if you start to break people,
maybe it's time,
especially in an individual.

626
00:41:17.490 --> 00:41:22.410
And you know,
Dick winters did this for band of brothers,
Dick Winters,
beyond,

627
00:41:22.440 --> 00:41:24.900
beyond the band of brothers.
He talked about,
Hey,

628
00:41:25.030 --> 00:41:28.030
I've got this guy that's a little losing the bubble and the pulling back,
hey,

629
00:41:28.040 --> 00:41:29.530
you got some admin stuff to do in the rear.

630
00:41:29.550 --> 00:41:32.940
Want to go ahead and take care of that.
Boom,
done.
Let this guy,
he'll up.

631
00:41:33.080 --> 00:41:33.913
What this guy needs?

632
00:41:34.100 --> 00:41:35.660
<v 0>He needs a break.
You need to rest.</v>

633
00:41:38.860 --> 00:41:42.640
And here we get the little briefing,
a little briefing from the lieutenant,

634
00:41:42.730 --> 00:41:45.490
who's going to tell them how they're going to push through this little and clear

635
00:41:45.491 --> 00:41:49.720
out this little pocket of enemy resistance.
This is how we'll do it.

636
00:41:49.750 --> 00:41:53.710
The lieutenant said a rifle platoon goes first.
Right behind them.

637
00:41:53.711 --> 00:41:57.010
We'll go a part of the heavy weapons platoon with machine guns to cover the

638
00:41:57.011 --> 00:42:00.190
first platoon.
Then comes another rifle platoon,

639
00:42:00.460 --> 00:42:03.970
then a small section with mortars in case they run into something pretty heavy.

640
00:42:04.210 --> 00:42:08.110
Then another rifle platoon and bringing up the rear the rest of the heavy

641
00:42:08.111 --> 00:42:10.240
weapons outfit to protect us from behind.

642
00:42:10.840 --> 00:42:14.770
We don't know what we'll run into and I don't want to stick right out in front,

643
00:42:14.950 --> 00:42:16.540
so why don't you come along with me.

644
00:42:16.690 --> 00:42:19.510
So he's talking to Ernie Pyle at that point saying,
listen,

645
00:42:20.320 --> 00:42:22.180
I don't know what's gonna be up front.
You stick with me.

646
00:42:22.720 --> 00:42:25.870
We'll go in the middle of the company.
I said,
okay,

647
00:42:27.010 --> 00:42:31.330
by this time I wasn't scared.
You seldom are.
Once you're into something,

648
00:42:31.810 --> 00:42:34.780
anticipation is the worst.
Fortunately,

649
00:42:35.020 --> 00:42:39.670
this little foray came up so suddenly there wasn't time for much anticipation.

650
00:42:40.570 --> 00:42:41.630
<v 1>The waiting,</v>

651
00:42:44.730 --> 00:42:45.900
<v 0>so they take,</v>

652
00:42:45.901 --> 00:42:49.920
they start taking a little fire and finally the shells stop and here we go.

653
00:42:49.921 --> 00:42:53.490
The shell stopped and finally the order to start was given.

654
00:42:54.210 --> 00:42:55.980
As we left the protection of the high wall,

655
00:42:55.981 --> 00:42:59.340
we had to cross a little covert right out in the open and then make a turn in

656
00:42:59.341 --> 00:43:02.430
the road.
The men went forward one at a time.

657
00:43:03.060 --> 00:43:07.650
They crouched and ran eight blight apelike across this dangerous space.

658
00:43:08.160 --> 00:43:11.160
Then beyond the culvert,
they filtered to either side of the road,

659
00:43:11.161 --> 00:43:14.190
stopping and squatting down every now and then to wait a few moments.

660
00:43:14.620 --> 00:43:18.000
The lieutenant kept yelling at them as they started spread it out.

661
00:43:18.001 --> 00:43:21.990
Now do you want to draw fire at yourselves?
Don't bunch up like that.

662
00:43:21.991 --> 00:43:23.970
Keep five yards apart,
spread it out.
Dammit.

663
00:43:25.440 --> 00:43:29.220
There's an almost irresistible pull to get close to somebody when you're in

664
00:43:29.221 --> 00:43:31.950
danger.
In spite of themselves.

665
00:43:32.340 --> 00:43:36.510
The men would run up close to the fellow ahead of them for company.

666
00:43:37.370 --> 00:43:41.100
But obviously if you're close to your,
you're close to people and one,

667
00:43:41.310 --> 00:43:44.850
well first of all in one bullet can kill two people,
but you get hit with a bomb.

668
00:43:44.851 --> 00:43:47.550
You get hit with a grenade,
you're going to kill multiple people.

669
00:43:47.760 --> 00:43:51.060
So you want to disperse,
you want to keep your dispersion,
it will spread out.

670
00:43:51.480 --> 00:43:55.290
But there's this little thing that people want to just get close to other
people.

671
00:43:55.380 --> 00:43:58.500
Yeah.
And everybody knows it's wrong.
And actually if you remember in the,
uh,

672
00:43:59.730 --> 00:44:00.990
in the beloved captain,

673
00:44:01.050 --> 00:44:03.570
that's what he was costing St guys spread out in the trench.
Don't,
Hey,

674
00:44:03.571 --> 00:44:07.410
don't bunch up.
And the,
and,
and the author was saying,

675
00:44:08.220 --> 00:44:10.800
we all just wanted to huddle together.
You want to get close together.

676
00:44:10.801 --> 00:44:14.130
You're in fear.
So you want to huddle and it's the wrong move.

677
00:44:16.750 --> 00:44:17.583
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

678
00:44:17.600 --> 00:44:22.220
<v 0>Now we get into description of the men as they're making this cross.</v>

679
00:44:22.430 --> 00:44:26.720
The men didn't talk amongst themselves,
they just went,

680
00:44:27.680 --> 00:44:31.100
they weren't heroic figures as they moved forward.
One at a time,

681
00:44:31.170 --> 00:44:32.310
few seconds apart.

682
00:44:32.850 --> 00:44:35.580
<v 4>You think of attackers as being savage and bold.</v>

683
00:44:36.270 --> 00:44:39.390
These men were hesitant and cautious.

684
00:44:40.170 --> 00:44:43.860
They were really the hunters,
but they looked like the hunted.

685
00:44:44.670 --> 00:44:49.650
There was a confused excitement into grim anxiety in their faces.

686
00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:55.830
They seemed terribly pathetic to me.
They weren't warriors.

687
00:44:56.010 --> 00:45:01.010
They were American boys who by mere chance of fate had wound up with guns in

688
00:45:01.141 --> 00:45:02.770
their hands,
sneaking up death,

689
00:45:02.771 --> 00:45:06.870
Wade and street in a strange and shattered city in a far away country and a

690
00:45:06.871 --> 00:45:10.690
driving rain.
They were afraid,

691
00:45:11.800 --> 00:45:14.680
but it was beyond their power to quit.

692
00:45:15.850 --> 00:45:19.510
They had no choice.
They were good boys.

693
00:45:19.870 --> 00:45:24.190
I talked with them all afternoon as we sneak slowly in word along the mysterious

694
00:45:24.191 --> 00:45:25.420
and rubbled street.

695
00:45:25.960 --> 00:45:30.960
And I know they were good boys and even though they weren't warriors born to

696
00:45:31.571 --> 00:45:34.870
kill,
they won their battles.

697
00:45:36.220 --> 00:45:37.420
That's the point.

698
00:45:43.560 --> 00:45:46.020
Regular guys,
World War,

699
00:45:46.030 --> 00:45:50.500
two regular guys in,
in it's,

700
00:45:50.501 --> 00:45:52.140
it's not depicted.

701
00:45:52.480 --> 00:45:56.510
They'll throw a character like that and to a movie you don't,
oh he's,
you know,

702
00:45:56.520 --> 00:45:59.280
just,
it looks like a regular guy.
But most of the guys don't.

703
00:45:59.281 --> 00:46:03.150
The Vanilla regular guys,
they look like bad ass war hero guys.

704
00:46:04.740 --> 00:46:08.100
And this is such a,
you don't hear this description where he's literally saying,

705
00:46:08.390 --> 00:46:12.900
um,
they weren't warriors.
They seemed terribly pathetic.

706
00:46:13.140 --> 00:46:15.330
And so you picture these guys that got this scared,

707
00:46:15.331 --> 00:46:19.590
strange look on their face and guess what?
They do their job.
Yeah.

708
00:46:20.520 --> 00:46:23.250
And they do it well yet strange.

709
00:46:23.251 --> 00:46:27.270
It's almost like you can look at them in both ways because on the one hand

710
00:46:27.750 --> 00:46:30.570
they're just regular guys.
But when you see him in action kind of thing,

711
00:46:30.990 --> 00:46:34.710
you're like all Dang,
they're getting out of their warriors.
You know it's true.

712
00:46:34.890 --> 00:46:38.760
I mean he clearly the warriors that,
like he said,
they,

713
00:46:38.761 --> 00:46:41.430
when their battles and even what they're doing right now,

714
00:46:41.431 --> 00:46:42.870
it takes massive courage.

715
00:46:43.100 --> 00:46:45.420
You're getting ready to step across the street where you know there's a machine

716
00:46:45.421 --> 00:46:50.310
gun fire could open up and take your life or take your legs or you know,

717
00:46:50.311 --> 00:46:55.110
wound you
that that takes some will that takes some disciplined.

718
00:46:55.500 --> 00:46:59.130
Yeah.
I mean,
how can you not just cower in the first corner?

719
00:46:59.340 --> 00:47:03.510
You see really,
you know,
when you compare it to everyday life,
man,

720
00:47:04.350 --> 00:47:06.990
I mean I don't,
I hate to,
I hate to,

721
00:47:06.991 --> 00:47:11.000
but I can't help but compare it to saving private Ryan that that might be right.

722
00:47:11.390 --> 00:47:15.660
And there's a part where they indicate that everyone's been trying to guess

723
00:47:17.360 --> 00:47:20.670
the job of the Oh yeah,
Miller,
whatever.

724
00:47:21.510 --> 00:47:22.560
They're trying to guess it right.

725
00:47:22.590 --> 00:47:27.590
And so that was like an exposure of like yeah,

726
00:47:27.601 --> 00:47:30.100
this is of the humanity and the yeah.
You know,
back then and

727
00:47:30.100 --> 00:47:32.740
<v 0>then he's like,
yeah,
I'm a school teacher and all this stuff,</v>

728
00:47:32.770 --> 00:47:36.270
all this like normal stuff.
And then meanwhile as the movie kind of progress,

729
00:47:36.290 --> 00:47:39.850
you see him in action.
It's like Dang for a school teacher,
these guys are,

730
00:47:40.240 --> 00:47:44.320
you know,
they're really getting the job.
Man.
We were,
when I first got Ramadi,

731
00:47:44.321 --> 00:47:47.980
we were there with the,
uh,
the two to eight,
which is a,

732
00:47:48.040 --> 00:47:50.080
which is a reserve unit from Pennsylvania,

733
00:47:50.500 --> 00:47:55.500
iron soldiers and led by a guy at the time was named Colonel Grand Ski.

734
00:47:56.320 --> 00:48:01.150
He's now a general,
but those guys were school teachers.
They were,

735
00:48:01.151 --> 00:48:03.910
I mean cause they were reservists.
So there was guys who were school teachers,

736
00:48:03.911 --> 00:48:05.770
there was guys there that were plumbers,
there was guys that are there,

737
00:48:05.780 --> 00:48:08.020
cable installers that were guys there that were mechanics.

738
00:48:08.021 --> 00:48:10.690
There was guys there that were lawyers.
They're just every job.

739
00:48:11.380 --> 00:48:16.210
And yet these guys were there fighting straight up and getting after it by the

740
00:48:16.211 --> 00:48:20.470
way to battle hardened.
And really they were,

741
00:48:20.500 --> 00:48:24.310
they were so impressive and we are so humbled by these guys.
These reservists,

742
00:48:24.311 --> 00:48:26.410
they were bad ass.
Nothing.
But again,

743
00:48:26.411 --> 00:48:31.120
nothing but respect and admiration for them on the battlefield.

744
00:48:31.180 --> 00:48:31.780
Yeah man.

745
00:48:31.780 --> 00:48:35.860
And the exactly where if let's say you didn't know their job outside of the,

746
00:48:35.950 --> 00:48:38.230
you know the battle and you see them,
you're like Dang,

747
00:48:38.231 --> 00:48:41.500
these guys are straight up.
This is their thing.
This is what their,

748
00:48:41.710 --> 00:48:46.000
their primary career is.
You know,
that's what it seems like.

749
00:48:46.090 --> 00:48:47.170
And I'll tell you,

750
00:48:47.310 --> 00:48:52.310
I just was out in Mississippi and I was with a bunch of guys that were

751
00:48:52.571 --> 00:48:56.230
reservists and Mississippi and one of the guys I was talking to,

752
00:48:56.890 --> 00:49:00.610
multiple guys that was talking to,
they had multiple deployments to Iraq and,

753
00:49:00.660 --> 00:49:05.530
and these are 12 month deployment.
14 month deployments.
These guys were awesome,

754
00:49:05.800 --> 00:49:09.730
awesome guys,
awesome professionals who had taken the fight to the enemy.

755
00:49:09.731 --> 00:49:13.930
So it's amazing that that America has these,

756
00:49:14.050 --> 00:49:17.290
these reservists that live their lives.
And then,
oh by the way,

757
00:49:17.291 --> 00:49:21.640
you're going to go on deployment to Iraq for 14 months right now and get after

758
00:49:21.641 --> 00:49:24.320
it.
Then you can come back and go into your normal job again following it back in

759
00:49:25.270 --> 00:49:28.940
and go and just be straight up affective.
Yup.
Not like they're,

760
00:49:28.941 --> 00:49:33.640
they're like timid,
you know,
cause I'm,
Hey,
I'm just here for 14 months,

761
00:49:33.820 --> 00:49:37.990
back home.
I'm,
you know,
I work at office,
whatever.
They're like,
nope,
watch me,

762
00:49:38.440 --> 00:49:42.010
watch me get it much.
We get it on.
So

763
00:49:44.650 --> 00:49:49.570
we get to a point now that you know,
that street fight continues,
they take down,

764
00:49:49.571 --> 00:49:53.560
they clear that pocket,
there's more combat description,

765
00:49:54.160 --> 00:49:59.160
but now they're getting ready to push out of Normandy beach outlay.

766
00:49:59.460 --> 00:50:01.360
They've,
so they've taken the beach,
they've secured it,

767
00:50:01.361 --> 00:50:04.270
they've taken some hedge rows,
they've got it locked in.
It's been,
it's been,

768
00:50:04.271 --> 00:50:07.690
you know,
some time,
but now they're getting ready to start making the push,

769
00:50:07.780 --> 00:50:12.280
making the push out of there.
And so that's what this is,
this to be a massive,

770
00:50:12.340 --> 00:50:17.340
massive attack and they're getting ready to get a brief and here we go.

771
00:50:18.221 --> 00:50:19.210
Back to the book,

772
00:50:19.300 --> 00:50:22.450
the regimental Colonel Stute in the center of the officers and went over the

773
00:50:22.451 --> 00:50:27.190
orders in detail.
Battalion commanders took down notes and their little books.

774
00:50:28.220 --> 00:50:29.720
Then General Barton arrived.

775
00:50:30.350 --> 00:50:34.580
The colonel called attention and everybody stood rigid until the general gave

776
00:50:34.581 --> 00:50:39.581
them carry on and enlisted man ran to the mass truck and got a folding stool for

777
00:50:40.101 --> 00:50:41.150
the general to sit on.

778
00:50:41.930 --> 00:50:46.340
He sat listening intently while the colonel wound up his instructions,

779
00:50:47.390 --> 00:50:49.550
the general stepped into the center of the circle.

780
00:50:50.150 --> 00:50:55.150
He stood at a slouch on one foot with the other leg,

781
00:50:55.940 --> 00:50:57.830
far out like a brace.

782
00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:02.930
He looked all around him as he talked.
He didn't talk long.

783
00:51:03.320 --> 00:51:08.030
He said,
this is one of the finest regiments in the American army.

784
00:51:08.690 --> 00:51:11.630
He was the last regimen out of France in the last war.

785
00:51:11.631 --> 00:51:14.450
It was the first regimen into France.
In this war.

786
00:51:15.120 --> 00:51:18.470
It is spearheaded every one of the divisions,
attacks and Normandy.

787
00:51:19.120 --> 00:51:22.910
It will spearhead this one for many years.

788
00:51:24.260 --> 00:51:29.260
This was my regiment and I feel very close to you and very proud.

789
00:51:31.090 --> 00:51:34.330
The generals lined face was a study in emotion,

790
00:51:35.320 --> 00:51:40.320
sincerity and deep sentiment weren't every contour and they show him from his

791
00:51:41.171 --> 00:51:45.490
eyes.
General Barton was a man of deep affections,

792
00:51:46.510 --> 00:51:47.980
the tragedy of war,

793
00:51:48.220 --> 00:51:51.670
both personal and impersonal hurt him.

794
00:51:53.690 --> 00:51:58.690
At the end his voice almost broke and I for one had a lump in my throat.

795
00:52:01.610 --> 00:52:03.920
He ended.
That's all.

796
00:52:05.120 --> 00:52:07.430
God bless you and good luck.

797
00:52:11.300 --> 00:52:12.133
<v 2>Okay.</v>

798
00:52:12.590 --> 00:52:17.110
<v 0>Okay.
And with that they begin this massive operation.</v>

799
00:52:19.640 --> 00:52:24.640
The first planes of the mass on slot came over a little before 10:00 AM they

800
00:52:25.071 --> 00:52:27.350
were the fighters and dive bombers.

801
00:52:27.740 --> 00:52:31.910
The main road running crosswise in front of us was their bottom line.

802
00:52:32.720 --> 00:52:36.140
They were to bomb only on the far side of that road.

803
00:52:37.220 --> 00:52:41.360
Our infantry had been pulled back a few hundred yards from the near side of the

804
00:52:41.361 --> 00:52:42.194
road.

805
00:52:42.380 --> 00:52:47.090
Everyone in the area had been given the strictest orders to be in foxholes for

806
00:52:47.091 --> 00:52:52.091
high level bombers can and do quite excusable Lee make mistakes.

807
00:52:53.090 --> 00:52:54.590
So did you understand that right there.

808
00:52:55.250 --> 00:52:59.690
So there's a very clear road and they say,
listen,

809
00:52:59.960 --> 00:53:02.960
the bombers are going to be bombing the other side of that road,

810
00:53:03.440 --> 00:53:08.000
but we're gonna back further away from the road just in case something goes

811
00:53:08.001 --> 00:53:10.760
wrong just in case bombs get dropped early.

812
00:53:14.880 --> 00:53:15.713
<v 2>Okay.</v>

813
00:53:16.320 --> 00:53:17.490
<v 0>Obviously this indicates,</v>

814
00:53:17.500 --> 00:53:21.870
I'm pointing that out for a reason because this is gets horrible.

815
00:53:23.250 --> 00:53:26.070
Our front lines were marked long strips

816
00:53:26.070 --> 00:53:31.040
<v 4>of colored cloth laid on the ground with colored smoke to guide our airmen</v>

817
00:53:31.050 --> 00:53:35.490
during the mass bommers bomming dive bombers hit it just right.

818
00:53:35.760 --> 00:53:39.540
We stood and watched them barrels nearly straight down out of the sky.

819
00:53:41.260 --> 00:53:44.830
They were bombing about a half a mile ahead of where we stood.

820
00:53:45.010 --> 00:53:47.350
They came in groups diving in every direction,

821
00:53:48.310 --> 00:53:52.810
perfectly timed one after another.
Everywhere we looked,

822
00:53:52.811 --> 00:53:54.280
separate groups of plane,
we're on,

823
00:53:54.400 --> 00:53:59.400
planes were on their way down or on their way back up or slanting over for a

824
00:53:59.561 --> 00:54:03.940
dive or circling,
circling,
circling over our heads.
And waiting for their turn.

825
00:54:05.840 --> 00:54:08.100
So I want you to picture what this is like.

826
00:54:08.820 --> 00:54:11.340
Picture what this is like and you don't,

827
00:54:11.341 --> 00:54:13.890
don't picture that you're watching it eat a movie cause that's,

828
00:54:14.100 --> 00:54:16.440
I understand that it's easy to picture it.
Okay.

829
00:54:16.770 --> 00:54:19.560
I want you to put your mind in this situation.

830
00:54:19.561 --> 00:54:23.130
Can you imagine what that looks like?
These,

831
00:54:23.131 --> 00:54:28.131
you're the plane that the sky is basically filling with planes and they're

832
00:54:28.651 --> 00:54:32.580
making these incredibly aggressive attacks.

833
00:54:33.480 --> 00:54:36.210
And this piece which I'm about to read,
a big chalk,

834
00:54:37.380 --> 00:54:42.030
this is one of the most magnificent descriptions

835
00:54:43.890 --> 00:54:45.330
of war I have read.

836
00:54:47.060 --> 00:54:47.893
<v 1>Okay,</v>

837
00:54:48.900 --> 00:54:49.733
<v 4>here we go.</v>

838
00:54:50.430 --> 00:54:55.430
The air was full of sharp and distinct sounds of cracking bombs and the heavy

839
00:54:55.591 --> 00:55:00.450
rips of the plains machine guns and the splintering screams of diving wings.

840
00:55:02.040 --> 00:55:05.580
It was all fast and furious,
yet distinct.

841
00:55:06.870 --> 00:55:09.690
And then on new sound,

842
00:55:09.930 --> 00:55:12.540
gradually droned into our ears,

843
00:55:13.110 --> 00:55:16.980
a deep sound and all encompassing with no notes in it.

844
00:55:17.310 --> 00:55:21.630
Just a gigantic faraway surge of doom like sound.

845
00:55:23.340 --> 00:55:24.900
It was the heavies.

846
00:55:26.250 --> 00:55:29.760
And so now he's talking about the heavy bombers that are going to bring the

847
00:55:29.761 --> 00:55:33.060
thunder and there's so many of them.
And they're so loud,

848
00:55:33.061 --> 00:55:38.061
it just drones out every other sound until just this massive far away surge of a

849
00:55:40.321 --> 00:55:44.430
doom like sound.
It was the heavies.

850
00:55:44.850 --> 00:55:48.600
They came from directly behind us.
At first,

851
00:55:48.930 --> 00:55:51.390
they were the mirus dots in the sky.

852
00:55:51.930 --> 00:55:56.930
We could see the clots of them against the far heavens too tiny to count

853
00:55:57.420 --> 00:56:01.680
individually may came on with a terrible slowness.

854
00:56:02.310 --> 00:56:07.310
They came in flights of 12 three flights to a group and in groups stretched out

855
00:56:07.771 --> 00:56:08.970
across the sky.

856
00:56:09.750 --> 00:56:13.350
They came in families of about 70 planes each,

857
00:56:14.100 --> 00:56:18.960
maybe those gigantic waves.
We're two miles apart.
Maybe they were 10 miles,

858
00:56:19.410 --> 00:56:20.430
I don't know,

859
00:56:21.810 --> 00:56:26.810
but I do know they came in constant procession and I thought it would never end.

860
00:56:29.020 --> 00:56:32.920
What the Germans must have fought is beyond comprehension.

861
00:56:34.030 --> 00:56:34.720
<v 2>Okay?</v>

862
00:56:34.720 --> 00:56:38.440
<v 4>The flight across the sky was slow and studied.</v>

863
00:56:39.730 --> 00:56:44.730
I've never known a storm or a machine or any resolve of man that had about it.

864
00:56:46.481 --> 00:56:49.780
The aura of such a ghastly relentlessness.

865
00:56:50.890 --> 00:56:55.890
I had the feeling that even had God appeared besieging Lee before them in the

866
00:56:56.921 --> 00:57:00.310
sky with palms out stretched to persuade them back.

867
00:57:01.600 --> 00:57:06.600
They would not have had the power within them to turn from their irresistible

868
00:57:07.541 --> 00:57:08.374
course.

869
00:57:10.240 --> 00:57:11.050
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

870
00:57:11.050 --> 00:57:15.870
<v 4>This is just,
that's such an incredible description of,
of good,</v>

871
00:57:15.890 --> 00:57:17.980
this impending doom.

872
00:57:21.010 --> 00:57:26.010
I stood with a little group of men ranging from kernels to privates back to the

873
00:57:26.321 --> 00:57:27.790
stone farmhouse.

874
00:57:29.800 --> 00:57:34.180
Slit trenches were all around the edges of the farm yard and a dug out with a

875
00:57:34.181 --> 00:57:35.950
tin roof was nearby,

876
00:57:36.340 --> 00:57:41.340
but we were so fascinated by the spectacle overhead that it never occurred to us

877
00:57:41.411 --> 00:57:43.210
that we might need the foxholes.

878
00:57:44.530 --> 00:57:49.530
The first huge flight pass directly overhead and others followed.

879
00:57:50.260 --> 00:57:55.060
We spread our feet and lean far back trying to look straight up until our steel

880
00:57:55.061 --> 00:57:56.200
helmets fell off.

881
00:57:57.510 --> 00:58:01.590
We'd cop our fingers around her eyes like Fieldglass's for a clearer view

882
00:58:04.010 --> 00:58:09.010
and then the bombs came be began like the crackle of popcorn and almost

883
00:58:11.030 --> 00:58:15.860
instantly swelled into a monstrous fury of noise that seems surely to destroy

884
00:58:16.040 --> 00:58:17.870
all the world ahead of us.

885
00:58:19.070 --> 00:58:24.070
From then on for an hour and a half that had in it the agonies of centuries.

886
00:58:25.550 --> 00:58:27.350
The bombs came down,

887
00:58:28.430 --> 00:58:32.510
a wall of smoke and dust directed by them,
grew high in the sky.

888
00:58:33.620 --> 00:58:37.460
It filtered along the ground back through our orchards.

889
00:58:37.970 --> 00:58:41.270
It's sifted around us and into our noses.

890
00:58:42.320 --> 00:58:46.790
The bright day groups slowly dark from it.
By now,

891
00:58:46.970 --> 00:58:50.120
everything was an indescribable cold turn of sounds.

892
00:58:50.420 --> 00:58:53.030
Individual noises did not exist.

893
00:58:53.480 --> 00:58:58.480
The thundering of the motors in the sky and the roar of bombs ahead filled all

894
00:58:58.671 --> 00:59:00.680
the space for noise on the earth.

895
00:59:01.730 --> 00:59:06.290
Our own heavy artillery was crashing all around us,
yet we could hardly hear it.

896
00:59:07.580 --> 00:59:10.940
The Germans began to shoot heavy high at GAC,

897
00:59:11.660 --> 00:59:16.430
great puffs of of it by the score speckled the sky until it was hard to

898
00:59:16.431 --> 00:59:21.200
distinguish smoke puffs from planes and then someone shouted,

899
00:59:21.320 --> 00:59:23.870
one of the planes was smoking.
Yes,
we can all see it.

900
00:59:24.020 --> 00:59:28.490
A faint line of black smoke stretch straight for a mile behind one of them and

901
00:59:28.491 --> 00:59:32.990
as we watched there were gigantic sweep of flame over the plane from nose to

902
00:59:32.991 --> 00:59:33.824
tail.

903
00:59:34.550 --> 00:59:39.320
It disappeared in flame and it's slanted slowly down and banked around the sky

904
00:59:39.321 --> 00:59:41.240
and great wide curves this way,

905
00:59:41.241 --> 00:59:46.241
and that is rhythmically and gracelessly gracefully is in a slow motion waltz.

906
00:59:46.940 --> 00:59:50.810
Then suddenly it seemed to change his mind and swept up word steeper and steeper

907
00:59:50.811 --> 00:59:53.260
and ever slower until finally it seemed poised,

908
00:59:53.261 --> 00:59:56.360
motionless on its own black pillar of smoke.

909
00:59:57.500 --> 01:00:02.500
And then just as slowly as it had turned over and dived for the earth of golden

910
01:00:02.931 --> 01:00:07.931
spearhead on the straight black shaft of its own creation and disappeared behind

911
01:00:08.721 --> 01:00:11.960
the tree tops.
But before it was down,

912
01:00:11.961 --> 01:00:16.040
there were more cries of there's another one smoking and there's a third one
now.

913
01:00:16.730 --> 01:00:21.440
Shoots came out of some of the planes out of some came,

914
01:00:21.441 --> 01:00:22.430
no shoots at all.

915
01:00:23.150 --> 01:00:27.710
One of the white silk caught on the tail of a plane.

916
01:00:28.250 --> 01:00:33.250
Men with binoculars could see him fighting to get loose until flames swept over

917
01:00:33.591 --> 01:00:34.130
him.

918
01:00:34.130 --> 01:00:39.050
And then a tiny black dot fell through space all alone.

919
01:00:40.800 --> 01:00:41.560
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

920
01:00:41.560 --> 01:00:46.560
<v 4>And all that time the great flat ceiling of the sky was roofed by other planes</v>

921
01:00:46.931 --> 01:00:51.340
that didn't go down plowing their way forward as if there were no turmoil in the

922
01:00:51.341 --> 01:00:55.090
world.
Nothing deviated them by the slightest.

923
01:00:55.390 --> 01:01:00.390
They stocked on slowly and with a dreadful Paul of sound as though they were

924
01:01:01.241 --> 01:01:06.241
seeing only something at a great distance and nothing existed between God.

925
01:01:07.421 --> 01:01:12.421
How we admired those men up there and sickened for the ones who fell

926
01:01:17.080 --> 01:01:17.913
incredible.

927
01:01:21.800 --> 01:01:25.550
It is possible to become so enthralled by some of the spectacles of war that man

928
01:01:25.551 --> 01:01:28.670
is momentarily captivated away from his own danger.

929
01:01:29.300 --> 01:01:32.210
That's what happened to our little groups of group of soldiers as we stood

930
01:01:32.211 --> 01:01:33.620
watching that mighty bombing,

931
01:01:34.850 --> 01:01:39.650
but that benign state didn't last long as we watched their crept into our

932
01:01:39.651 --> 01:01:40.670
consciousness,

933
01:01:40.820 --> 01:01:45.820
a realization that the wind droves of exploding bombs were easing back towards

934
01:01:46.851 --> 01:01:51.851
us flight by flight instead of gradually forward as the plan called for.

935
01:01:55.380 --> 01:02:00.380
Then we were horrified by the suspicion that those machines high in the sky and

936
01:02:00.451 --> 01:02:02.280
completely detached from us.

937
01:02:02.281 --> 01:02:07.281
We're aiming their bombs at the smoke line on the ground and a gentle breeze was

938
01:02:07.681 --> 01:02:11.160
drifting.
The smoke line back over us

939
01:02:13.170 --> 01:02:15.700
and indescribable kind of panic came over us.

940
01:02:15.970 --> 01:02:20.040
We stood tensed and muscle and frozen and intellect watching each flight

941
01:02:20.041 --> 01:02:23.520
approach and Passover feeling trapped and completely helpless,

942
01:02:24.780 --> 01:02:27.390
and then all of an instant,

943
01:02:27.391 --> 01:02:32.391
the universe became filled with gigantic rattling of as it of huge ripe seeds in

944
01:02:34.141 --> 01:02:35.910
a mammoth dry gourd.

945
01:02:36.780 --> 01:02:39.630
I doubt that any of us had ever heard that sound before,

946
01:02:40.110 --> 01:02:42.810
but instinct told us what it was.

947
01:02:43.710 --> 01:02:48.540
It was bombs by the hundred hurdling down through the air above us.

948
01:02:49.930 --> 01:02:54.040
Many times I'd heard bombs whistle or swish or Russell,

949
01:02:54.340 --> 01:02:57.040
but never before had I heard bombs rattle.

950
01:02:57.790 --> 01:03:00.130
I still don't know what the explanation of it,

951
01:03:01.180 --> 01:03:05.810
but it was an awful sound.
We dived some got into a dug out.

952
01:03:05.980 --> 01:03:09.700
Others made foxholes and ditches and some got behind the garden wall,

953
01:03:09.910 --> 01:03:14.140
although which side would be behind was anybody's guess.

954
01:03:14.990 --> 01:03:15.410
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

955
01:03:15.410 --> 01:03:18.980
<v 4>I was too late for the dug out.
The nearest place was a wagon shed,</v>

956
01:03:18.981 --> 01:03:21.270
which formed on one end of the stone house.

957
01:03:22.130 --> 01:03:24.230
The rattle was right down upon us.

958
01:03:24.440 --> 01:03:28.280
I remember hitting the ground flat all spread out like the cartoons of people

959
01:03:28.281 --> 01:03:32.420
flattened by steam rollers and it's swarming like an eel to get under one of the

960
01:03:32.421 --> 01:03:37.421
heavy wagon we wagons in the shed and officer whom I didn't know was wriggling

961
01:03:38.481 --> 01:03:39.320
beside me.

962
01:03:39.860 --> 01:03:43.400
We stopped at the same time simultaneously feeling it was hopeless to move

963
01:03:43.401 --> 01:03:46.460
further.
The bombs were already crashing around us.

964
01:03:46.640 --> 01:03:50.240
We lay with our heads slightly up like two snakes staring at each other.

965
01:03:51.320 --> 01:03:56.320
I know it was in both our minds and in our eyes asking each other what to do.

966
01:03:58.800 --> 01:04:02.130
Neither of us knew we said nothing.

967
01:04:03.060 --> 01:04:08.060
We just lay sprawled gaping at each other and a few title appeal our faces about

968
01:04:09.151 --> 01:04:11.760
a foot apart until it was over.

969
01:04:13.540 --> 01:04:18.400
There is no description of the sound and fury of those bombs except to say it

970
01:04:18.401 --> 01:04:21.640
was chaos and a waiting for darkness.

971
01:04:23.100 --> 01:04:25.500
The feeling of the blast was sensational.

972
01:04:25.680 --> 01:04:30.420
The air struck us in hundreds of continuing flutters.
Our ears drummed and rang.

973
01:04:30.630 --> 01:04:34.950
We could feel quick little waves of concussion on our chest and in her eyes.

974
01:04:36.520 --> 01:04:37.810
At last.
The sound,

975
01:04:37.840 --> 01:04:41.950
the sound died down and we looked at each other in disbelief.

976
01:04:42.880 --> 01:04:47.880
Gradually we left the foxholes and sprawling places and came out to see what the

977
01:04:47.891 --> 01:04:51.580
sky had in store for us as far as we could see.

978
01:04:51.581 --> 01:04:53.830
Other waves were approaching from behind.

979
01:04:54.580 --> 01:04:56.860
When a wave would pass a little to the side of us,

980
01:04:57.730 --> 01:05:02.730
we were grateful for most of them flew directly overhead time and time again.

981
01:05:03.581 --> 01:05:07.150
The rattle came down over us.
Bomb struck in the orchard to our laugh.

982
01:05:07.180 --> 01:05:09.040
They struck into the orchards ahead of us.

983
01:05:09.340 --> 01:05:12.040
They struck as far as a mile behind us.

984
01:05:13.020 --> 01:05:13.410
<v 2>Okay.</v>

985
01:05:13.410 --> 01:05:17.800
<v 4>Everything about us was shaken,
but our group came through on hurt.</v>

986
01:05:19.720 --> 01:05:24.720
I can't record what any of us actually felt or thought during those horrible

987
01:05:26.351 --> 01:05:31.180
climaxes.
I believe a person's feelings at such time.

988
01:05:31.370 --> 01:05:34.570
Our kaleidoscopic an indefinable,

989
01:05:35.350 --> 01:05:36.580
he just waits.

990
01:05:37.300 --> 01:05:41.950
That's all with an inhuman tenseness of muscle and nerves.

991
01:05:43.270 --> 01:05:47.770
An hour or so later I began to get sore all over and by mid afternoon my back

992
01:05:47.771 --> 01:05:50.440
and shoulders eight does.
Though I'd been beaten with a club.

993
01:05:51.430 --> 01:05:56.080
It was simply the result of muscles tensing themselves too tight for too long

994
01:05:56.081 --> 01:05:57.850
against anticipated shock.

995
01:05:59.490 --> 01:06:00.323
<v 2>Okay.</v>

996
01:06:00.620 --> 01:06:05.510
<v 4>When we came out of our sprawling and stood up again to watch,</v>

997
01:06:05.511 --> 01:06:08.540
we knew that the error had been caught and checked.

998
01:06:09.590 --> 01:06:13.220
The bombs were falling again where they were intended a mile or so ahead,

999
01:06:14.660 --> 01:06:16.040
even at a mile away,

1000
01:06:16.220 --> 01:06:20.350
a thousand bombs hitting within a few seconds can shake the earth and shattered

1001
01:06:20.351 --> 01:06:23.600
the air.
There was still a dread in our hearts,

1002
01:06:24.050 --> 01:06:29.050
but it gradually eased as the Tomo and destruction moved slightly forward.

1003
01:06:31.140 --> 01:06:31.973
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1004
01:06:32.020 --> 01:06:35.440
<v 4>It seems incredible to me that any German could have come out of that</v>

1005
01:06:35.441 --> 01:06:39.190
bombardment with his sanity when it was over.

1006
01:06:39.580 --> 01:06:44.580
Even I was grateful in a chassis and way that I had never experienced before for

1007
01:06:45.431 --> 01:06:47.080
just being alive.

1008
01:06:48.460 --> 01:06:51.970
I fought and attack by our troops was impossible.

1009
01:06:51.971 --> 01:06:56.890
Then for it is an unnerving thing to be bombed by your own planes.

1010
01:06:57.520 --> 01:07:01.330
During the bad part or colonel I had known a long time was walking up and down

1011
01:07:01.331 --> 01:07:02.390
behind the farmhouse,

1012
01:07:02.470 --> 01:07:06.460
snapping his fingers and saying over and over again to himself,
God dammit,

1013
01:07:06.670 --> 01:07:10.780
God dammit.
As he passed me once,
he stopped and stared and said,
God dammit,

1014
01:07:12.770 --> 01:07:16.700
and I said,
there can't be any attack now,
can there?

1015
01:07:17.120 --> 01:07:18.140
And he said No.

1016
01:07:18.860 --> 01:07:22.820
And began walking against snapping his fingers and tossing his arms as though he

1017
01:07:22.821 --> 01:07:24.560
were throwing rocks at the ground.

1018
01:07:25.760 --> 01:07:28.970
The leading company of our battalion was to spearhead the attack.

1019
01:07:28.971 --> 01:07:31.370
40 minutes after the heavy bombing ceased,

1020
01:07:32.630 --> 01:07:35.510
the company had been hit directly by our bombs.

1021
01:07:36.050 --> 01:07:39.350
There are casualties including casualties in shock.

1022
01:07:39.440 --> 01:07:43.730
We're heavy men went to pieces and had to be sent back.

1023
01:07:44.330 --> 01:07:46.910
The company shit was shattered and shaken,

1024
01:07:47.900 --> 01:07:52.900
yet company be attacked and on time to the minute they attacked and within the

1025
01:07:54.590 --> 01:07:58.640
hour sent back word that they advanced 800 yards through German territory and

1026
01:07:58.641 --> 01:08:01.400
we're still going around our farm yard.

1027
01:08:01.730 --> 01:08:05.680
Men with stars on their shoulders almost wept when the word came over the

1028
01:08:05.690 --> 01:08:06.740
portable radio.

1029
01:08:07.790 --> 01:08:11.210
The American soldier can be majestic when he needs to be.

1030
01:08:12.470 --> 01:08:17.470
I'm sure that back in England that other men bomber crews wept.

1031
01:08:20.180 --> 01:08:25.070
And maybe they did really in the awful knowledge that they had killed our own

1032
01:08:25.071 --> 01:08:26.390
American troops.

1033
01:08:27.410 --> 01:08:32.410
But the chaos and bitterness there in the orchards and between the hedge roads

1034
01:08:32.811 --> 01:08:36.260
that afternoon,
soon passed after the bidding,

1035
01:08:36.290 --> 01:08:41.290
bitterness came the sober remembrance that the air force was the strong right

1036
01:08:41.751 --> 01:08:45.260
arm in front of us.
Not only at the beginning but CSUS,

1037
01:08:45.261 --> 01:08:48.740
Leslie in everlastingly,
every moment of the faintest daylight.

1038
01:08:48.800 --> 01:08:51.770
The air force was up there banging away ahead of us.

1039
01:08:53.660 --> 01:08:57.710
Anybody made mistakes,
the enemy made them just the same as we did.

1040
01:08:58.380 --> 01:09:03.320
The smoke and confusion of battle bewildered us on the ground as well in the
air.

1041
01:09:04.520 --> 01:09:08.630
And in this case the percentage of error was really very small compared to the

1042
01:09:08.631 --> 01:09:11.990
colossal storm of bombs that fell upon the enemy.

1043
01:09:13.550 --> 01:09:18.170
The air force was wonderful throughout the invasion and the men on the ground

1044
01:09:18.171 --> 01:09:19.004
appreciated it.

1045
01:09:21.250 --> 01:09:22.083
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

1046
01:09:22.150 --> 01:09:26.380
<v 4>So obviously we talk about blue on blue a lot here.</v>

1047
01:09:26.530 --> 01:09:30.880
I think that's about as an extreme example as I've ever heard of.

1048
01:09:31.340 --> 01:09:33.110
<v 1>Hmm.
And,</v>

1049
01:09:34.840 --> 01:09:35.790
<v 4>uh,
you know,</v>

1050
01:09:35.791 --> 01:09:40.680
the blue on blue thing is such a nightmare because it's your own people,

1051
01:09:41.700 --> 01:09:46.700
it's your own people and it's a lack of communication and it's the fog of war

1052
01:09:48.960 --> 01:09:51.810
pain.
You can't do anything you can't shoot back.

1053
01:09:53.700 --> 01:09:57.000
While you can do is sit there and wait and it's amazing.

1054
01:09:57.001 --> 01:10:02.001
One of those company that was scheduled to attack is so shaken up that they

1055
01:10:02.881 --> 01:10:07.650
can't go forward.
But then the other company just go,
we got this step aside.

1056
01:10:10.400 --> 01:10:11.233
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

1057
01:10:11.640 --> 01:10:14.040
<v 4>Now the attack starts pushing forward</v>

1058
01:10:15.540 --> 01:10:16.373
<v 1>and</v>

1059
01:10:16.900 --> 01:10:19.750
<v 4>we get a little description of one of the commanders.</v>

1060
01:10:19.751 --> 01:10:22.120
The commander of the regimen was one of my favorites.

1061
01:10:22.750 --> 01:10:26.560
He was a regular army colonel and he was overseas in the last war two his

1062
01:10:26.561 --> 01:10:29.500
division commander said the only trouble with him was that he was,

1063
01:10:29.501 --> 01:10:32.230
that he got to bold and if you weren't careful,

1064
01:10:33.370 --> 01:10:37.840
he was liable to get clipped some fine day when tired and dirty,

1065
01:10:37.841 --> 01:10:41.200
he could have played a movie gangster,
but either way,

1066
01:10:41.440 --> 01:10:43.150
his eyes always twinkled.

1067
01:10:43.330 --> 01:10:46.660
He had a faculty for direct thought that was outstanding.

1068
01:10:47.830 --> 01:10:50.800
The colonel went from one battalion to another during the battle.

1069
01:10:50.890 --> 01:10:53.950
During battle from early light until darkness.

1070
01:10:54.430 --> 01:10:58.860
He wore a new new type field jacket that fitted him like a sack and he carried a

1071
01:10:58.861 --> 01:11:01.540
long stick that Teddy Roosevelt had given to him.

1072
01:11:02.350 --> 01:11:06.400
He kept constantly prodding his commanders to push hard not to let up and keep

1073
01:11:06.401 --> 01:11:07.570
driving and driving.

1074
01:11:08.140 --> 01:11:11.980
He was impatient with his commanders who lost the main point of the war by

1075
01:11:11.981 --> 01:11:15.480
getting involved in the,
the main point,
of course,

1076
01:11:15.481 --> 01:11:17.280
being to kill Germans.

1077
01:11:18.090 --> 01:11:23.090
His philosophy of war was expressed in the simple formula of shoot the son of

1078
01:11:23.821 --> 01:11:24.654
bitches.

1079
01:11:25.450 --> 01:11:25.980
<v 1>Okay?</v>

1080
01:11:25.980 --> 01:11:28.080
<v 4>Once I was at a battalion command post,</v>

1081
01:11:28.770 --> 01:11:32.400
when we got word that 60 Germans were coming down the road and a counter attack,

1082
01:11:32.460 --> 01:11:35.460
everybody got excited.
They called the kernel on a field fold,

1083
01:11:35.461 --> 01:11:38.970
gave him on the field phone,
gave him details and asked him what to do.

1084
01:11:39.630 --> 01:11:43.170
He had the solution to nuts.
Nutshell in a nutshell.
He said,

1085
01:11:43.530 --> 01:11:46.110
shoot this sons of bitches and hung up.

1086
01:11:48.210 --> 01:11:48.650
<v 1>Okay,</v>

1087
01:11:48.650 --> 01:11:52.040
<v 4>got to keep things simple and you got to keep your,</v>

1088
01:11:52.130 --> 01:11:54.380
your tasks very focused.

1089
01:11:55.880 --> 01:12:00.050
You know what's all this complication?
We're here to kill Germans,

1090
01:12:00.110 --> 01:12:02.300
so kill them sons of bitches.

1091
01:12:05.970 --> 01:12:06.181
Yeah,

1092
01:12:06.181 --> 01:12:11.181
we'll get to a younger soldier that he goes through a description of Clayton's

1093
01:12:13.531 --> 01:12:16.380
weirdest.
This guy named Clayton.
Clayton's weirdest experience.

1094
01:12:16.390 --> 01:12:18.630
Be Funny if it weren't so filled with Patheos.

1095
01:12:19.380 --> 01:12:23.490
He was returning with a patrol one moonlit night when the enemy opened up on

1096
01:12:23.491 --> 01:12:24.210
them.

1097
01:12:24.210 --> 01:12:29.210
Tommy leaped right through a hedge and spotting a foxhole plunged into it.

1098
01:12:29.700 --> 01:12:31.290
To his amazement and fright.

1099
01:12:31.291 --> 01:12:35.190
There was a German in that foxhole sitting pretty holding a machine pistol in

1100
01:12:35.191 --> 01:12:40.110
his hands.
Clayton shot him three times in the chest before you could say scat,

1101
01:12:41.370 --> 01:12:46.370
the German hardly moved and then Tommy realized the man had been killed earlier.

1102
01:12:49.070 --> 01:12:50.580
He had been shooting a corpse.

1103
01:12:51.420 --> 01:12:56.420
All his experiences seem to have had no effect on his mile on this mild soldier

1104
01:12:57.391 --> 01:13:01.170
from Indiana,
except perhaps to make him even quieter than before.

1105
01:13:02.130 --> 01:13:07.130
The worst experience of all is just the accumulated blur and the hurting

1106
01:13:08.491 --> 01:13:13.470
vagueness of being too long in the lines,
the everlasting alertness,

1107
01:13:13.530 --> 01:13:18.150
the noise and fear,
the cell by cell exhaustion,

1108
01:13:18.960 --> 01:13:23.960
the finning of surrounding ranks as day follows nameless day and the constant

1109
01:13:25.411 --> 01:13:30.411
marching to Aternity of one's own small quota of chances for survival.

1110
01:13:33.120 --> 01:13:38.120
Those are the things that hurt and destroy and soldiers like Tommy Clayton went

1111
01:13:39.721 --> 01:13:44.721
back to them because they were good soldiers and they had a duty they could not

1112
01:13:45.901 --> 01:13:46.734
define

1113
01:13:51.550 --> 01:13:52.660
mental stress.

1114
01:13:58.150 --> 01:14:02.150
Now
they continue to push through,

1115
01:14:02.151 --> 01:14:07.151
they take Paris and it's really incredible to to hear what that was like.

1116
01:14:07.850 --> 01:14:10.010
Then you should definitely buy this book

1117
01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:16.140
and read it and here's how he closes it out.

1118
01:14:18.270 --> 01:14:23.190
The final chapter is being written in the latter part of August,

1119
01:14:23.190 --> 01:14:27.810
1944 is being written under an apple tree in a lovely green orchard on the

1120
01:14:27.811 --> 01:14:29.100
interior of France.

1121
01:14:29.610 --> 01:14:33.060
It could well be that the European war will be over and done by the time you

1122
01:14:33.061 --> 01:14:35.640
read this book or it might not,

1123
01:14:37.050 --> 01:14:40.860
but the end is inevitable and it cannot be put off for long.

1124
01:14:41.730 --> 01:14:44.220
The German is beaten and he knows it.

1125
01:14:45.480 --> 01:14:50.480
It will seem odd when at some given hour the shooting stops and everything

1126
01:14:52.651 --> 01:14:54.210
suddenly changes again,

1127
01:14:55.230 --> 01:15:00.230
it will be odd to drive down and unknown road without that little knot of fear

1128
01:15:00.451 --> 01:15:01.350
in your stomach.

1129
01:15:02.770 --> 01:15:07.770
Odd not to listen with animal like alertness for the meaning of every distance.

1130
01:15:08.651 --> 01:15:09.484
Sound

1131
01:15:10.630 --> 01:15:15.630
odd not to have your spirit odd to have your spirit released from the perpetual

1132
01:15:18.101 --> 01:15:23.101
weight that is compounded of fear and death and dirt and noise and anguish.

1133
01:15:28.630 --> 01:15:31.990
The end of war will be a gigantic relief,

1134
01:15:31.991 --> 01:15:35.380
but it cannot be a matter of hilarity.
For most of us.

1135
01:15:36.580 --> 01:15:40.450
Somehow it would seem sack religious to sing and dance.

1136
01:15:40.451 --> 01:15:42.160
When the great day comes,

1137
01:15:43.240 --> 01:15:47.350
there are so many who can never sing and dance again.

1138
01:15:49.060 --> 01:15:49.541
Many,

1139
01:15:49.541 --> 01:15:54.541
many thousands of Americans have come to join the ones who have already slept in

1140
01:15:57.041 --> 01:15:59.140
France for a quarter of a century.

1141
01:16:01.670 --> 01:16:05.060
For some of us,
the war has already gone on too long.

1142
01:16:05.870 --> 01:16:08.510
Our feelings have been rung and drain.

1143
01:16:08.750 --> 01:16:12.050
They cringe from the effort of coming alive again.

1144
01:16:13.400 --> 01:16:18.400
Even the approach of the end seems to have brought little inner elation.

1145
01:16:21.040 --> 01:16:24.800
It is only brought a tire does sense of relief.

1146
01:16:26.630 --> 01:16:31.040
I do not pretend that my own feeling is the spirit of our armies.
If it were,

1147
01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:34.460
we probably would not have the power to win.

1148
01:16:35.980 --> 01:16:37.330
Most men are stronger.

1149
01:16:38.380 --> 01:16:43.380
Our soldiers still can hate or glorify or be glad with true emotion.

1150
01:16:45.760 --> 01:16:50.380
For them,
death has a pain then victory,

1151
01:16:50.530 --> 01:16:53.850
a sweet scent,
but for me,

1152
01:16:54.450 --> 01:16:59.450
war has become a Fiat black depression without highlights a revulsion of the

1153
01:17:00.631 --> 01:17:03.150
mind and an exhaustion of the spirit.

1154
01:17:05.250 --> 01:17:09.060
The war in France has been especially vicious because it was one of the,

1155
01:17:09.080 --> 01:17:12.500
it was one of the enemies.
Last stance.

1156
01:17:13.340 --> 01:17:15.950
We have one big kind of because of many things.

1157
01:17:16.490 --> 01:17:20.450
We have one partly because the enemy was weakened from our other battles,

1158
01:17:21.110 --> 01:17:23.210
the Warren Francis,
our grand finale,

1159
01:17:23.211 --> 01:17:27.500
but the victory here is the result of all other victories that went before.

1160
01:17:28.160 --> 01:17:32.390
It is a result of Russia and the Western Desert and the bombings and the

1161
01:17:32.391 --> 01:17:33.620
blocking of the sea.

1162
01:17:34.610 --> 01:17:38.060
It is a result of Tunisia and Sicily and Italy.

1163
01:17:38.120 --> 01:17:41.240
We must never forget or belittle those campaigns.

1164
01:17:42.260 --> 01:17:47.260
We have one because we have had magnificent top leadership at home and in our

1165
01:17:47.301 --> 01:17:50.150
allies and with ourselves overseas.

1166
01:17:50.870 --> 01:17:55.850
Surely America made it's too perfect choices in general.
Eisenhower in general,

1167
01:17:55.851 --> 01:17:56.684
Bradley,

1168
01:17:56.840 --> 01:18:01.840
they are great men to me doubly great because they are direct and kind.

1169
01:18:04.130 --> 01:18:08.180
We won because we are audacious.

1170
01:18:08.840 --> 01:18:13.370
One could not help but be moved by the colossus of our invasion.

1171
01:18:14.150 --> 01:18:16.100
It was a bold and mighty thing.

1172
01:18:16.250 --> 01:18:21.250
One of the epics of all history in the emergency of war.

1173
01:18:21.500 --> 01:18:24.170
Our nation's powers are unbelievable.

1174
01:18:25.130 --> 01:18:27.740
The strength we have spread around the world is appalling.

1175
01:18:27.770 --> 01:18:31.430
Even to those who make up the individual cells of that strength.

1176
01:18:32.570 --> 01:18:37.570
I am sure that in the past two years I've heard soldiers say a thousand times if

1177
01:18:38.151 --> 01:18:41.120
only we could have created all this energy for something good.

1178
01:18:42.590 --> 01:18:46.430
But we rise above our normal powers only in times of destruction

1179
01:18:48.530 --> 01:18:53.530
we have won this war because our men are brave and because of many other things,

1180
01:18:54.410 --> 01:18:59.080
because of Russia and England and the passage of time and the gifts of nature,

1181
01:18:59.081 --> 01:19:00.410
orals materials,

1182
01:19:01.670 --> 01:19:06.670
we did not win it because destiny created us better than all other peoples.

1183
01:19:07.280 --> 01:19:12.280
I hope that in victory we are more grateful than we are proud.

1184
01:19:13.490 --> 01:19:16.340
I hope we can rejoice in victory,

1185
01:19:17.720 --> 01:19:18.650
but humbly

1186
01:19:20.150 --> 01:19:23.480
the dead men would not want us to gloat.

1187
01:19:26.660 --> 01:19:31.660
The end of one war is a great federal broken from around our lives,

1188
01:19:33.260 --> 01:19:34.940
but there is still another to be broken.

1189
01:19:35.660 --> 01:19:40.660
The Pacific war may yet belong and bloody nobody can foresee,

1190
01:19:42.290 --> 01:19:45.710
but it would be disastrous to approach it with easy hopes.

1191
01:19:46.670 --> 01:19:50.630
Our next few months at home will be torn between the new spiritual freedom of

1192
01:19:50.631 --> 01:19:55.070
half piece and the old grinding blur of half war.

1193
01:19:56.330 --> 01:19:58.820
It will be a confusing period for us.

1194
01:20:00.230 --> 01:20:04.400
Thousands of men will be returning to you soon.

1195
01:20:05.880 --> 01:20:07.890
They have been gone a time

1196
01:20:09.930 --> 01:20:13.560
and they've seen and done things and felt things you cannot know.

1197
01:20:15.040 --> 01:20:16.390
They will be changed.

1198
01:20:17.080 --> 01:20:20.050
They will have to learn how to adjust themselves to piece.

1199
01:20:21.040 --> 01:20:24.640
Last night we had a violent electrical storm around our countryside.

1200
01:20:24.910 --> 01:20:28.910
The storm was half over before we realize that the flashes and the crashing

1201
01:20:28.980 --> 01:20:29.411
around us,

1202
01:20:29.411 --> 01:20:34.411
we're not alter artillery but plain old fashioned thunder and lightening.

1203
01:20:36.010 --> 01:20:39.100
It will be odd to hear only thunder again.

1204
01:20:40.270 --> 01:20:45.270
You must remember that such little thing says that are in our souls and will

1205
01:20:46.691 --> 01:20:50.820
take time
and all of us together.

1206
01:20:50.940 --> 01:20:55.290
We'll have to learn how to reassemble our broken world into a pattern so firm

1207
01:20:55.291 --> 01:21:00.291
and so fair that another great war can not soon be possible to tell the simple

1208
01:21:00.811 --> 01:21:05.370
truth.
Most of us over in France don't pretend to know the right answer.

1209
01:21:06.810 --> 01:21:11.810
Submersion war does not necessarily qualify a man to be the master of peace.

1210
01:21:14.160 --> 01:21:17.190
All we can do is fumble and try once more,

1211
01:21:17.250 --> 01:21:19.740
try out of the memory of our anguish

1212
01:21:21.860 --> 01:21:24.890
and be as tolerant with each other as we can.

1213
01:21:33.390 --> 01:21:38.340
And this book
was dedicated by Ernie Pyle,

1214
01:21:38.370 --> 01:21:40.230
and I'm going to read the dedication now

1215
01:21:42.190 --> 01:21:46.240
in solemn salute to those thousands of our comrades.

1216
01:21:46.300 --> 01:21:51.300
Great brave men that they were for whom there will be no homecoming

1217
01:21:55.580 --> 01:21:56.413
<v 2>ever.</v>

1218
01:22:06.980 --> 01:22:10.580
<v 4>And
Ernie Pyle</v>

1219
01:22:12.460 --> 01:22:15.100
did get to experience homecoming.

1220
01:22:18.610 --> 01:22:21.580
Unfortunately,
it was not joyous

1221
01:22:23.570 --> 01:22:24.890
and it was not long.

1222
01:22:26.640 --> 01:22:31.640
He he battled with depression and emotional turmoil

1223
01:22:36.510 --> 01:22:39.520
over his experiences in Warren.

1224
01:22:39.550 --> 01:22:41.850
You could hear him talking about those.

1225
01:22:42.240 --> 01:22:47.240
And also his wife who had some kind of mental issues and she'd actually been

1226
01:22:48.721 --> 01:22:49.800
hospitalized.

1227
01:22:49.801 --> 01:22:54.330
And so he was distressed and depressed about that.

1228
01:22:56.420 --> 01:22:57.590
And on top of that,

1229
01:22:59.980 --> 01:23:02.080
the war was not over for him.

1230
01:23:04.010 --> 01:23:09.010
And he mentioned there in the end that there's only half piece because there was

1231
01:23:09.281 --> 01:23:12.730
still a war in the Pacific.
And he knew that.

1232
01:23:14.260 --> 01:23:19.260
And in personal letters and in conversations that he had with his friends,

1233
01:23:21.850 --> 01:23:26.290
he explained a personal
foreboding,

1234
01:23:27.270 --> 01:23:30.220
a sense that he would not live through the war,

1235
01:23:32.470 --> 01:23:37.470
but when he was asked by the Department of the Navy to join the battle against

1236
01:23:42.401 --> 01:23:44.470
imperial Japan and the Pacific,

1237
01:23:45.310 --> 01:23:50.310
he reluctantly maybe fearfully,

1238
01:23:51.310 --> 01:23:54.280
but due to flee.
Agreed to go.

1239
01:23:56.310 --> 01:23:57.143
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

1240
01:23:57.400 --> 01:23:58.300
<v 4>And it was there</v>

1241
01:24:00.870 --> 01:24:05.870
in the Pacific on a tiny island called e Shima just off the coast of Okinawa

1242
01:24:10.110 --> 01:24:12.840
that Ernie Pyle was shot and killed

1243
01:24:15.520 --> 01:24:16.810
by a single sniper bullet.

1244
01:24:16.900 --> 01:24:17.733
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1245
01:24:20.430 --> 01:24:25.430
<v 4>And members of the 77th infantry division who'd been there with for the</v>

1246
01:24:28.651 --> 01:24:33.651
operation quickly marked where he was killed with a sign that read

1247
01:24:37.180 --> 01:24:41.620
at this spot,
the 77th infantry division.

1248
01:24:43.130 --> 01:24:43.963
Lost a buddy

1249
01:24:45.470 --> 01:24:50.470
Ernie pile on 18 April,

1250
01:24:51.980 --> 01:24:52.813
1945.

1251
01:24:59.620 --> 01:25:01.840
So Mr Pile.

1252
01:25:03.380 --> 01:25:04.213
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1253
01:25:05.480 --> 01:25:10.480
<v 4>Thank you for your service and your sacrifice.</v>

1254
01:25:13.180 --> 01:25:14.013
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1255
01:25:15.610 --> 01:25:16.443
<v 4>And to</v>

1256
01:25:18.910 --> 01:25:22.060
the journalists that are out there now in this day,

1257
01:25:22.061 --> 01:25:27.061
especially the war journalists who take risks to record and report history.

1258
01:25:31.890 --> 01:25:33.030
Thank you for what you do.

1259
01:25:37.140 --> 01:25:37.973
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1260
01:25:39.300 --> 01:25:39.721
<v 4>Again,</v>

1261
01:25:39.721 --> 01:25:44.721
the book is called brave men by Ernie Pyle and it will give you some real

1262
01:25:47.941 --> 01:25:52.320
insight
into the nature of war

1263
01:26:01.510 --> 01:26:02.343
<v 1>echo.</v>

1264
01:26:05.330 --> 01:26:09.120
<v 4>The world is a crazy place.
Yeah.
And</v>

1265
01:26:10.730 --> 01:26:14.630
it's amazing that you can live the life that we live

1266
01:26:17.250 --> 01:26:22.250
and some people go through lives their life without ever even

1267
01:26:25.440 --> 01:26:29.790
even just brushing against this madness.

1268
01:26:32.370 --> 01:26:36.870
And uh,
I'll say this for the thousandth time.

1269
01:26:39.010 --> 01:26:40.720
I believe that it is important

1270
01:26:43.030 --> 01:26:47.080
to delve into these things so that you learn

1271
01:26:49.540 --> 01:26:53.290
not just about leadership but about life.

1272
01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:54.833
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1273
01:26:55.970 --> 01:27:00.970
<v 4>And how precious and glorious</v>

1274
01:27:03.510 --> 01:27:04.343
life is.

1275
01:27:13.040 --> 01:27:17.500
Damned life has

1276
01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:19.990
ups and downs.

1277
01:27:21.520 --> 01:27:24.100
It has good and bad.

1278
01:27:24.730 --> 01:27:29.680
Good has darkness and light in everybody's life.
Makes those transitions

1279
01:27:34.620 --> 01:27:35.453
and

1280
01:27:36.990 --> 01:27:41.990
having darkness in the world or in your life does not exclude

1281
01:27:45.350 --> 01:27:46.183
<v 1>the light.</v>

1282
01:27:48.110 --> 01:27:52.130
<v 4>In fact,
I think it makes that light just a little bit brighter.</v>

1283
01:27:55.510 --> 01:27:56.480
And so when we,

1284
01:27:57.800 --> 01:28:02.480
we don't have to stay here in the darkness,
we can go.

1285
01:28:03.890 --> 01:28:08.450
We've paid our respects and we will continue to pay our respects

1286
01:28:10.550 --> 01:28:15.290
as we go forward.
And with that,

1287
01:28:16.910 --> 01:28:21.910
I guess it's a good time to answer some questions from

1288
01:28:23.870 --> 01:28:26.060
the inner webs,
from the inner webs.

1289
01:28:27.540 --> 01:28:28.373
<v 1>Sure.</v>

1290
01:28:30.140 --> 01:28:35.140
<v 4>And actually before we get into questions from the inner webs speaking it inner</v>

1291
01:28:35.710 --> 01:28:38.930
webs,
there's kind of some ways that you can utilize the other wet,

1292
01:28:38.970 --> 01:28:40.980
the interwebs for other things.

1293
01:28:43.740 --> 01:28:47.580
One of them is,
and by the way,
this,

1294
01:28:47.610 --> 01:28:50.820
for those of you that don't know
now,

1295
01:28:50.821 --> 01:28:54.750
echo is going to say some stuff about the inner webs and about supporting the

1296
01:28:54.751 --> 01:28:57.560
podcast.
You know what I'm going to do?
I'm going to,
I'm going like,

1297
01:28:57.920 --> 01:29:01.890
I'm going to be hit a switch and you'll a little decompression with drinks him.

1298
01:29:02.070 --> 01:29:05.310
I'm gonna drink some white tea over here with a pomegranate and I'm going to get

1299
01:29:05.311 --> 01:29:07.920
a little adjustment,
a little mindset change,

1300
01:29:08.280 --> 01:29:12.960
get into the zone for answering some questions.
Sure.
So there's,

1301
01:29:13.050 --> 01:29:18.050
there's actually a dual purpose for echos,

1302
01:29:18.930 --> 01:29:22.230
discussion of how to support the podcast.
Yes.

1303
01:29:22.370 --> 01:29:26.250
You shows you how to support the podcast,
which is much appreciated.
Also,

1304
01:29:26.790 --> 01:29:31.790
I can decompress for a minute from being bombed by my own planes,

1305
01:29:35.550 --> 01:29:39.870
from being stressed,
from being back in the war zone,

1306
01:29:40.350 --> 01:29:45.120
World War Two style.
How he describes it.
I mean,

1307
01:29:45.121 --> 01:29:46.800
you can,
you know,
uh,

1308
01:29:46.801 --> 01:29:51.500
writers in general or are just really good at explaining stuff.
I mean,

1309
01:29:52.660 --> 01:29:56.670
yeah,
pretty much.
All right.
And you can see the difference in the way that men,

1310
01:29:56.671 --> 01:29:59.940
this one in particular really to,
to me anyway,
really,

1311
01:30:00.840 --> 01:30:05.130
really delivered with the,
with the descriptions and stuff.
And it was like,
yeah,

1312
01:30:05.160 --> 01:30:10.020
there's so many one liners in there,
but I'm listening.
W when I was reading it,

1313
01:30:10.870 --> 01:30:12.450
I have certain ways of,
um,

1314
01:30:12.610 --> 01:30:17.520
I have certain ways of notating kind of what I'm going to read and,
and that,

1315
01:30:17.521 --> 01:30:20.460
you know,
some of that stuff's just circled and somewhat since then,
but,

1316
01:30:20.490 --> 01:30:24.600
but occasionally if something to me,
if I,
if it hits me,

1317
01:30:25.110 --> 01:30:30.110
I put one single red line underneath each individual word,

1318
01:30:31.320 --> 01:30:34.260
eh,
that I'm going to read.

1319
01:30:35.380 --> 01:30:39.390
And I normally I might do that like once or twice a book,

1320
01:30:39.391 --> 01:30:43.920
but there's a couple paragraphs where I had done it multiple times because those

1321
01:30:43.921 --> 01:30:46.740
lines are just powerful.

1322
01:30:47.640 --> 01:30:52.200
Like the one that I just opened the book back up to room,
can't put it down,

1323
01:30:52.560 --> 01:30:54.330
but you know,
when he's like,
um,

1324
01:30:54.540 --> 01:30:57.510
and then a new sound gradually droned into our ears,

1325
01:30:57.511 --> 01:31:00.840
a sound deep and all encompassing with no notes in it.

1326
01:31:01.230 --> 01:31:05.700
Just a gigantic faraway surge of doom like sound.

1327
01:31:06.090 --> 01:31:07.770
And this is the part that I underlined.

1328
01:31:08.400 --> 01:31:13.110
It was the heavies and you know,
this,
the power of that,

1329
01:31:13.111 --> 01:31:16.470
just knowing that these are the heavy bombers,
which,
you know,

1330
01:31:16.471 --> 01:31:19.860
it's no big deal to us now because we have giant machines.

1331
01:31:19.861 --> 01:31:23.700
But a heavy bomber back then was like a,

1332
01:31:24.630 --> 01:31:29.400
it was just this ultimate modern machine that had been created that nothing

1333
01:31:29.401 --> 01:31:33.810
could destroy what these things,
nothing was close to it.
And not only who,

1334
01:31:33.811 --> 01:31:38.430
we created one of these insane power machines,

1335
01:31:38.580 --> 01:31:43.580
we'd created hundreds and hundreds and actually we created thousands of them and

1336
01:31:44.161 --> 01:31:48.960
they were all a mast and coming to destroy this little section.

1337
01:31:49.830 --> 01:31:52.800
It was the heavies God.

1338
01:31:54.340 --> 01:31:59.200
So yeah,
it's a,
it's a book that definitely draws you in.

1339
01:31:59.201 --> 01:32:00.760
His writing that he,
that was the fee,

1340
01:32:00.761 --> 01:32:05.140
the fact that he writes a very straight forward,
very,

1341
01:32:05.590 --> 01:32:09.040
very plain and direct English is I think one of the things that makes it so

1342
01:32:09.041 --> 01:32:13.240
powerful.
I love how he can pick up where he compares.
Like,

1343
01:32:14.130 --> 01:32:16.840
and a lot of writers do this and when you can do it good,
it's really powerful.

1344
01:32:16.850 --> 01:32:18.700
Where like for example,
the uh,

1345
01:32:18.790 --> 01:32:22.760
he talked about the one plane that I think he got hit or it was crashing and you

1346
01:32:22.761 --> 01:32:23.441
compare it to be,

1347
01:32:23.441 --> 01:32:28.240
he said he was a spear of the light lit spear with a smoke trail.

1348
01:32:28.300 --> 01:32:30.730
I was like,
Dang,
you can see exactly what that looks like.

1349
01:32:31.660 --> 01:32:33.640
And it's weird too because although you can go watch this,

1350
01:32:33.641 --> 01:32:37.150
I mean they have film footage of this stuff,
but that,

1351
01:32:37.151 --> 01:32:41.590
that takes you there visually.
But I think the reading and listening does,

1352
01:32:41.950 --> 01:32:46.360
it takes you there mentally.
He takes you there in your head,

1353
01:32:47.350 --> 01:32:49.540
which is more,
which is more powerful than,

1354
01:32:50.020 --> 01:32:53.110
and this happens to me all the time when I'm,
when I'm reading it,

1355
01:32:53.111 --> 01:32:58.000
I'm getting better.
When we started this podcast,
I could tell like,
oh,

1356
01:32:58.001 --> 01:32:59.920
that's powerful.
Like,
Oh yeah,
that's going to be,

1357
01:32:59.921 --> 01:33:01.420
that's a really powerful statement.

1358
01:33:02.170 --> 01:33:06.040
And then sometimes I would read it and it'll be 12 more times more powerful

1359
01:33:06.041 --> 01:33:09.520
where I'd be like,
Whoa,
my God,
I'd be getting just power.

1360
01:33:09.670 --> 01:33:14.670
Because when you read it aloud and now I'm a little bit more aware that hey,

1361
01:33:14.920 --> 01:33:18.250
you're going to have to read this borough,
you better keep,

1362
01:33:18.251 --> 01:33:23.200
you better get your head in the game because it's going to be powerful.
Yeah.

1363
01:33:23.410 --> 01:33:27.910
So that's something I've become more aware of as we've done this more and more.

1364
01:33:27.911 --> 01:33:32.911
And as I read all these books and gone through them and underlined the stuff and

1365
01:33:33.191 --> 01:33:37.330
thought about the way it's going to sound and thought about what it means to say

1366
01:33:37.780 --> 01:33:39.640
it was the heavies.

1367
01:33:41.410 --> 01:33:42.243
<v 3>Awesome.</v>

1368
01:33:43.140 --> 01:33:46.560
<v 4>So while I tell it to decompress over here,</v>

1369
01:33:46.990 --> 01:33:50.050
<v 3>Yup.
Go.
Well,</v>

1370
01:33:50.051 --> 01:33:53.730
speaking to inner webs and awesome by the way.
Um,

1371
01:33:55.270 --> 01:33:59.770
let's talk about supplements it.
So we do a lot of time at this time on it,
right?

1372
01:33:59.771 --> 01:34:00.491
Best supplements.

1373
01:34:00.491 --> 01:34:05.440
We all know that even though we are already know that that is a big deal because

1374
01:34:05.441 --> 01:34:10.150
of the nature of just supplement companies in general.
So rest assured on it.

1375
01:34:10.151 --> 01:34:13.630
Best one,
that's it.
On its supplements,

1376
01:34:13.631 --> 01:34:17.320
you can get 10% off because of the Jocko link,

1377
01:34:17.321 --> 01:34:19.690
which is [inaudible] dot com slash Jocko 10% off.
Boom,

1378
01:34:21.010 --> 01:34:24.370
supplement your wallet a little bit.
Sublimate your,

1379
01:34:25.030 --> 01:34:30.030
your body and into your mind and your mind off of Brady Alpha brain for sure,

1380
01:34:32.290 --> 01:34:35.260
but notably,
Kay,
I'm going to admit some.

1381
01:34:35.261 --> 01:34:39.610
I didn't take Krill oil when I went till recently.

1382
01:34:39.611 --> 01:34:43.540
So Mira.
Okay.
I in the,
in the spirit of extreme ownership,

1383
01:34:43.690 --> 01:34:48.690
apparently I w I was not clear enough to you have you know about the fact that I

1384
01:34:50.981 --> 01:34:51.730
wanted it.

1385
01:34:51.730 --> 01:34:55.680
<v 4>Oh,
from when you had sent me a text,
like a bra you got near that grill.</v>

1386
01:34:56.690 --> 01:34:57.980
I wasn't just wondering that because

1387
01:34:57.980 --> 01:35:01.310
<v 3>I don't want it anyway.
I'll admit I didn't take that offer.</v>

1388
01:35:01.320 --> 01:35:05.320
Marinetec take Jocko,
bring me Krill oil now.
You know,

1389
01:35:06.580 --> 01:35:09.020
I think I said that a few times.
Okay,

1390
01:35:09.030 --> 01:35:12.710
so I take the Krill oil and I'm not,

1391
01:35:12.770 --> 01:35:17.770
I'm not this guy who's like has all these nagging joint pains when I go work out

1392
01:35:18.540 --> 01:35:21.260
because really,
that's really when I think,
okay,
do I have joint pain?
No,
no,
no.

1393
01:35:21.261 --> 01:35:23.630
I work out good hard or rule Jujitsu.
They do all this stuff.

1394
01:35:23.631 --> 01:35:25.010
I don't have joint pain,
but here's the thing.

1395
01:35:25.100 --> 01:35:28.160
I do have joint pain when I wake up in the morning.

1396
01:35:29.090 --> 01:35:33.170
And the thing is,
like I said,
when you're like,
when I think of when someone says,

1397
01:35:33.220 --> 01:35:36.140
do you have joint pain?
I'm thinking when I work out,
that's it.

1398
01:35:36.500 --> 01:35:38.900
I don't think like,
you know,
other times unless they're,

1399
01:35:38.930 --> 01:35:42.290
they're asking specifically.
So like my daughter,
she's three and a half now.

1400
01:35:42.291 --> 01:35:45.620
She's kind of like a bigger three and a half,
two and she comes,
runs up,

1401
01:35:46.070 --> 01:35:49.160
wakes me up a lot of times and it's like,
Hey Karen,
me downstairs.

1402
01:35:49.161 --> 01:35:52.730
So when I sit up,
she jumps on my back.
She weighs 40 pounds.

1403
01:35:55.040 --> 01:35:58.430
I'm not saying I'm,
you know,
the power lift or nothing,

1404
01:35:58.460 --> 01:36:03.020
but 40 pounds is not 40 pounds,
I don't think even has anywhere.
Yeah,

1405
01:36:03.021 --> 01:36:03.854
no 40

1406
01:36:07.520 --> 01:36:10.910
she's 40 pounds.
She jumps onto the back.
I'm like,
oh,
I got to focus,

1407
01:36:11.120 --> 01:36:15.020
got to focus on like my,
yeah,
just because of the stiffness,
not necessarily pain,

1408
01:36:15.050 --> 01:36:17.990
but just like stiff.
You know how like if you just didn't warm up at all,

1409
01:36:17.991 --> 01:36:21.040
you can't just,
it's like that feeling.
And then recently my,

1410
01:36:21.140 --> 01:36:24.660
my ankle got jacked up one day and I have like,
I think this torn ligament.

1411
01:36:24.661 --> 01:36:27.500
So you kind of watch out your feedback.
Yeah.
You know,

1412
01:36:27.501 --> 01:36:29.570
but it had already been jack by the way,

1413
01:36:29.690 --> 01:36:32.360
so it got fully locked and then it like inflamed it.

1414
01:36:32.660 --> 01:36:37.660
So I got to walk downstairs with this girl on my back with my stiffness and I'm

1415
01:36:39.171 --> 01:36:42.740
like,
Oh hey,
no problem.
I do it almost every day.
No problem.

1416
01:36:42.920 --> 01:36:47.800
But let's face it,
those are all signs of gentleman challenge.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1417
01:36:47.810 --> 01:36:50.750
But I take the Krill oil,
not the first day,
not even the second day,

1418
01:36:50.751 --> 01:36:54.020
but it was maybe a few days later she jumps on my back.

1419
01:36:54.800 --> 01:36:57.630
I'm still working out hard by the way.
So it's not like,
Ooh,
you recovered.

1420
01:36:57.900 --> 01:37:00.170
She jumps on my back.
I'm like,
Dang,
I feel solid.

1421
01:37:00.530 --> 01:37:03.200
I can go like when I stand up I'm like boom.
Popping up.

1422
01:37:04.430 --> 01:37:09.250
Noticeably reduced still there.
My ankle is still there right now.

1423
01:37:09.360 --> 01:37:11.570
It's still,
but bro,
this was like,

1424
01:37:11.600 --> 01:37:15.470
I would say maybe four or five days and this is what I know.
I was like,
Dang,

1425
01:37:15.471 --> 01:37:18.860
this is,
this is good oils.
Real.
Yeah.

1426
01:37:18.880 --> 01:37:22.400
And there's been a bunch of bunch of people on Twitter who have come back and

1427
01:37:22.401 --> 01:37:26.060
said,
hey,
I started taking krill oil.
And then a week later they're like,
man,

1428
01:37:26.270 --> 01:37:30.080
my shoulder's good to go.
You know?
It really works.
So it does really work.

1429
01:37:30.290 --> 01:37:32.750
It really does.
Yeah.
And then like I said,
that mean,

1430
01:37:32.751 --> 01:37:36.770
and here my wife's dad was like telling her lung,

1431
01:37:36.771 --> 01:37:40.520
this is years ago saying no Krill oil,
no one,
not fish official who's good.

1432
01:37:40.910 --> 01:37:43.880
Krill oil is that.
And I'm like Krill,
I look up Krill.
It's the trim.
Like,

1433
01:37:43.910 --> 01:37:47.210
oh sweet,
it's joint pain,
it's all this stuff or whatever.
And like I said,

1434
01:37:47.211 --> 01:37:50.300
even back then,
right now,
same thing when I work,
I don't have joint pain.

1435
01:37:50.810 --> 01:37:54.090
Maybe if I have a strain of stuff,
but that's my joint pain general,
you know?

1436
01:37:54.350 --> 01:37:55.650
So I'm like,
all right,
good for you.

1437
01:37:56.100 --> 01:37:58.920
Fucking knock yourself out with a crude oil when I need it.

1438
01:37:58.921 --> 01:38:02.320
And then I'm going to come on,
maybe I'll ask you about some stuff.
So you know,

1439
01:38:02.340 --> 01:38:06.420
I see it and it's cool.
Good,
but this is the first time I really like,

1440
01:38:06.550 --> 01:38:10.900
I get,
I got you.
The krill us now.
You get that,
get that.

1441
01:38:11.250 --> 01:38:14.670
So when I run out,
go ahead.
Give me another Krill oil.
Okay.
Yeah,
that's clear.

1442
01:38:14.671 --> 01:38:18.920
Yeah.
Cool.
All right.
Let me know.
We'll sell you sell back to the book.

1443
01:38:20.280 --> 01:38:22.860
What else were your bars in this?
This is what we,

1444
01:38:22.861 --> 01:38:26.610
I think were birds are made out of the buffalo meat.
They are artists.
They are,

1445
01:38:27.360 --> 01:38:31.010
we never said that.
Oh well my boss does that even matter,
you know,

1446
01:38:31.980 --> 01:38:36.670
because because you're eating buffalo,
which must be stronger.

1447
01:38:36.800 --> 01:38:39.060
Well,
yeah,
but um,
nonetheless,

1448
01:38:39.660 --> 01:38:42.920
to me that makes it even more awesome.
Not because,

1449
01:38:43.290 --> 01:38:47.610
I mean not for any specific reason other than maybe novelty,

1450
01:38:47.611 --> 01:38:52.140
but it's still pretty dope in my opinion.
Um,
so still tastes really good.

1451
01:38:53.520 --> 01:38:56.610
That's for meal replacement.
Someone asked me on Twitter,
Hey,
do you,
you know,

1452
01:38:56.611 --> 01:38:59.940
what meal replacement or protein shakes or whatever,
would you recommend if any?

1453
01:39:00.290 --> 01:39:04.170
None.
Yeah.
Well that's what I said too,
is someone said the same thing to me,

1454
01:39:05.040 --> 01:39:07.390
meal replacement.
I said,
why would you replace a state?

1455
01:39:10.560 --> 01:39:11.760
But in the event,
not really,

1456
01:39:11.761 --> 01:39:15.810
the answer to that is gross or disgusting or horrible.

1457
01:39:15.840 --> 01:39:20.220
Maybe you'd want to replace them or you don't have to look,
I'm driving a truck.

1458
01:39:21.030 --> 01:39:23.370
I'm driving a,
I dunno,
a airplane or something for a long time.

1459
01:39:24.270 --> 01:39:29.190
I want you to driving my airplane and all due respect.
Yeah,
probably right.

1460
01:39:30.150 --> 01:39:35.100
But,
but okay,
there you go.
Worrier bar.
That's the SRA
filler.

1461
01:39:36.300 --> 01:39:39.000
Eat Two of them.
That's a big filler.
Eat three big,

1462
01:39:40.500 --> 01:39:43.200
they're not messing around and they're good.
That's the thing.
Like,

1463
01:39:43.201 --> 01:39:46.440
remember back in the day that you know the,
the bars

1464
01:39:48.440 --> 01:39:50.880
back then,
even right now,
you eat one of those like,
oh,
all right,

1465
01:39:50.881 --> 01:39:51.541
I see where you're going.

1466
01:39:51.541 --> 01:39:53.430
Whether you're trying to make it like a candy bar where you're trying to,

1467
01:39:54.230 --> 01:39:58.590
it's not like that at all.
This is good.
Anyway,

1468
01:39:58.710 --> 01:40:01.750
don't worry about our salad.
Um,
another week.
It's,
uh,

1469
01:40:01.800 --> 01:40:06.240
support the podcasts in the event of you being in the mood to support the

1470
01:40:06.241 --> 01:40:10.590
podcast is next time you go shopping@amazon.com,

1471
01:40:11.670 --> 01:40:16.050
click through one of our links.
It's like a passive way,
actively,

1472
01:40:16.051 --> 01:40:20.520
aggressively efficient way to support and super easy.

1473
01:40:20.521 --> 01:40:24.090
It doesn't cost you anything.
You Click through,
you do your shopping,
boom.

1474
01:40:24.510 --> 01:40:26.820
It's like we get like a referral thing.
Well,

1475
01:40:26.830 --> 01:40:29.670
what I like about that is because I don't want to ask people,

1476
01:40:29.671 --> 01:40:31.530
like a lot of people,
they want to donate money.

1477
01:40:31.770 --> 01:40:35.880
I don't want you to donate money to us.
If you want to give us money,

1478
01:40:36.180 --> 01:40:40.620
that's awesome.
But I'd rather you buy a tee shirt if you can afford it.
But if,

1479
01:40:40.621 --> 01:40:44.880
let's say you can't afford anything because you're broke,
that's okay.

1480
01:40:45.120 --> 01:40:46.590
When you order something from Amazon,

1481
01:40:47.520 --> 01:40:51.360
this is just free money that you give to us.
So it's all good.
Yeah.
Yeah.
In a way,

1482
01:40:51.361 --> 01:40:56.160
it's almost like a collective,
hey,
we all shop at Amazon,

1483
01:40:56.180 --> 01:40:59.270
we're in this thing together,
you know,
kind of thing.
I don't know.
It's,

1484
01:40:59.350 --> 01:41:02.920
it's an Amazon planing buster with spare the change,
right?

1485
01:41:02.980 --> 01:41:05.110
They can spare it a little something for the Jocko podcast.

1486
01:41:05.440 --> 01:41:10.000
You're actively making Amazon give us money.
How's that for getting after it?

1487
01:41:10.001 --> 01:41:14.290
But then,
but,
but there,
you know,
so it's like this weird like circle almost,

1488
01:41:14.350 --> 01:41:17.050
you know,
they,
you know,
they buy from Amazon.
We're like,
hey,

1489
01:41:17.051 --> 01:41:20.170
go to Amazon but go through us.
And Amazon is like,
hey,
thanks for buying.

1490
01:41:20.290 --> 01:41:23.380
Thanks for sending them.
We're supporting Amazon,
whether it be books or whatever,

1491
01:41:23.381 --> 01:41:24.520
duct tape,
all this stuff.

1492
01:41:25.230 --> 01:41:29.950
Cause we're making people want to buy stuff from Amazon I.
E books.
Sure.
Yeah.

1493
01:41:30.450 --> 01:41:32.690
The less people are gonna need to buy a,

1494
01:41:32.770 --> 01:41:36.940
a white dude from [inaudible] from Amazon too,
which is coming so good.
You know,

1495
01:41:38.480 --> 01:41:41.200
it's so good.
It came out so good.
I'm pumped.

1496
01:41:43.360 --> 01:41:47.980
Yeah.
That's going to be solving that is solid currently.
That's solid.
But yeah,

1497
01:41:47.981 --> 01:41:50.860
the Amazon it anyway,
again,
it's support that way.
Um,

1498
01:41:50.980 --> 01:41:54.700
like I always say a big part of that or a big issue,

1499
01:41:54.701 --> 01:41:58.750
but it's a thing in there is remembering to do it.
If you want to do this,

1500
01:41:58.770 --> 01:42:03.640
the remembering to do it.
So we do have what's called the trooper tool.
All it is.

1501
01:42:03.641 --> 01:42:06.500
If you go,
you download it and it's basically you click on it,

1502
01:42:06.501 --> 01:42:10.360
Samsung trooper trooper tool,
chrome extension,
click on it.

1503
01:42:10.390 --> 01:42:11.710
Except that it's on your thing.

1504
01:42:11.711 --> 01:42:15.970
It automatically does it for you from here on out.
Dope.

1505
01:42:16.030 --> 01:42:20.640
It's like a little official thing to it.
So solid.
Um,

1506
01:42:20.680 --> 01:42:25.630
and
we were trying to update,
I've been talking to him,

1507
01:42:25.690 --> 01:42:28.750
I'm trying to update it for Canada,

1508
01:42:28.780 --> 01:42:33.730
UK so they can have the tool for them as well.
That's cool because yeah,

1509
01:42:34.630 --> 01:42:37.930
we're working on that one but they,
Yay.
That's good.
Trooper tool.

1510
01:42:37.931 --> 01:42:38.980
You don't have to remember it anymore.

1511
01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:44.000
You remember at one time that's all shop at Amazon still support aggressive Lee

1512
01:42:45.580 --> 01:42:46.413
efficiently

1513
01:42:48.220 --> 01:42:53.220
and the of course support by subscribing to the podcast on iTunes and youtube

1514
01:42:54.010 --> 01:42:57.010
channel.
Grab to the Youtube Channel.
Yeah,
that's legit.

1515
01:42:57.850 --> 01:43:01.150
And of course the Jocko store.

1516
01:43:01.500 --> 01:43:04.300
Oh I think we're,
I'm not,

1517
01:43:04.301 --> 01:43:06.580
I think I know that we're trying,

1518
01:43:06.790 --> 01:43:11.790
we are trying our best to provide multidimensional items.

1519
01:43:14.330 --> 01:43:18.910
Like even in a simple tee shirt is multiple,
multiple dimensions to it.
You know,

1520
01:43:19.120 --> 01:43:20.380
it's not just,
hey,
that's a cool saying.

1521
01:43:21.730 --> 01:43:26.730
The saying is important and extends way beyond what you'd expect on the surface.

1522
01:43:27.490 --> 01:43:30.700
That goes for all the shirts.
So including the rash cards,

1523
01:43:31.150 --> 01:43:35.490
including the rash guys.
Okay,
so new stuff,
new stuff.
The rash guards,

1524
01:43:35.500 --> 01:43:39.430
the rash guards are good as far as the fit of course.

1525
01:43:39.430 --> 01:43:43.210
And that man did good.
And what I what?
What's cool about,

1526
01:43:45.490 --> 01:43:50.470
I mean,
here's the reality,
when you,
when you,
when you put on a uniform,

1527
01:43:50.980 --> 01:43:54.350
Yup.
When you put on a uniform,
you change your mentality a little bit.

1528
01:43:54.610 --> 01:43:59.270
This is factually,
Yup.
Factually.
And so when people are like,
aw man,

1529
01:43:59.271 --> 01:44:03.560
I was wearing the discipline equals t d d discipline colloquium teacher today I

1530
01:44:03.561 --> 01:44:08.370
got my PR on clean and jerk.
And I'm like,
yeah,
yeah.
You,

1531
01:44:08.590 --> 01:44:13.590
you put on your uniform and there's a mental like state of mind that makes it a

1532
01:44:13.851 --> 01:44:15.290
little adjustment in the brain.

1533
01:44:15.740 --> 01:44:19.310
You know what's real funny about that exact notion?
When I,

1534
01:44:19.430 --> 01:44:21.950
when we first got the first shirt to this lineage was freedom.

1535
01:44:22.300 --> 01:44:26.340
I put it on the gray one and I get,
I know that that thing that's,
it's,

1536
01:44:26.750 --> 01:44:30.860
it's a psychological thing.
Yeah.
Yeah.
By the way,

1537
01:44:30.861 --> 01:44:33.620
one of the most powerful things in your whole life.
Psychological.
Anyway,

1538
01:44:33.830 --> 01:44:34.820
so I put it on and I was like,
yeah,

1539
01:44:34.821 --> 01:44:39.290
I'm going to take a picture of me in the new shirt kind of thing and I put it on

1540
01:44:39.291 --> 01:44:42.650
at night and I was going to work on anyway and man I put it on.
I was like,
yeah,

1541
01:44:42.651 --> 01:44:47.270
I felt that exactly on the shirt that I made,
you know.
Anyway,
yeah,
it's so true.

1542
01:44:47.271 --> 01:44:48.170
And the rash guard,

1543
01:44:48.171 --> 01:44:51.440
I'm not going to go into the story but I put it on the rash guard yesterday.

1544
01:44:52.690 --> 01:44:55.550
You're working.
It worked out very well.
I did very well.

1545
01:44:55.610 --> 01:45:00.610
So there's some sort of a subliminal power that you can gain.

1546
01:45:01.041 --> 01:45:05.600
Yes.
So true.
And when else thinking rashes,
it's false advertising.

1547
01:45:05.780 --> 01:45:07.820
If you were this rash,
this rash guard,

1548
01:45:07.850 --> 01:45:12.680
your Jiu Jitsu would improve 19% how false that off.

1549
01:45:14.830 --> 01:45:18.170
And I went in to the whole rash guard situation like,
Oh yeah,

1550
01:45:18.171 --> 01:45:19.970
we need rash guards because people were saying,
hey,

1551
01:45:19.971 --> 01:45:22.860
we need like this rash guards and there were Jujitsu,
there was a demand sick.

1552
01:45:22.880 --> 01:45:26.750
But here's the thing,
like rash guards,

1553
01:45:26.751 --> 01:45:30.470
like the short sleep all Brad,
this is like if you go like biking and stuff,

1554
01:45:30.500 --> 01:45:34.460
that's really what it's for.
It's like biking,
uh,
like crossfit.

1555
01:45:34.461 --> 01:45:39.230
Anything where you're like,
that's really what rash guards are for.

1556
01:45:39.231 --> 01:45:43.340
I mean Jujitsu now cause there's just no,
but we used to back in the day,

1557
01:45:44.720 --> 01:45:48.230
we used to just where we were,
if people were wearing rash guards,

1558
01:45:48.320 --> 01:45:50.480
there was no such thing as Jews who were not rash guard.
Right.

1559
01:45:50.510 --> 01:45:52.940
There was only actual Rashford restaurants.

1560
01:45:52.941 --> 01:45:56.040
And you know what it is for bodyboarding is what it is.
Cause you get a rash

1561
01:45:57.740 --> 01:46:01.650
for all means of water sports.
Yeah.

1562
01:46:02.440 --> 01:46:05.880
And uh,
my,
my little brother,
he's a diver,
he died spear fishing.

1563
01:46:06.610 --> 01:46:11.500
He's dope too.
He thought he got this.
Anyway,
he's on quiet.
So,
um,

1564
01:46:11.810 --> 01:46:16.550
same thing.
You go diving waters,
but it's like,
that's what this is for,
including,

1565
01:46:16.551 --> 01:46:21.140
but not limited to Jujitsu to just as a complete bonus on the tail end of that.

1566
01:46:21.170 --> 01:46:24.350
But if you wear this for now,
these are specifically designed for to do too

1567
01:46:26.830 --> 01:46:30.490
there for everything and just multiperson.
Yeah,
it might multipurpose.
Yup.

1568
01:46:30.730 --> 01:46:33.820
And straight up.
If you wear for Jujitsu,
you're going to do better.

1569
01:46:34.920 --> 01:46:39.140
I'm making that claim.
Ashtray.
A lot of it.
I love it.

1570
01:46:39.970 --> 01:46:43.150
Nonetheless.
He,
I've got rolled with you while you're wearing it.
Yeah.
Good luck.

1571
01:46:43.240 --> 01:46:44.080
Good luck with that one.

1572
01:46:46.660 --> 01:46:49.090
We will go to the gym after this recording.

1573
01:46:49.830 --> 01:46:54.830
Also new that's out is patches for Jujitsu for anything.

1574
01:46:56.160 --> 01:46:59.880
They're just patches do you can sell on their iron on,
but you sold so I'm on,

1575
01:46:59.890 --> 01:47:03.090
so I'm on.
Yeah.
Um,
patches.
Discipline equals freedom.

1576
01:47:03.120 --> 01:47:07.240
There is a Jujitsu specific patch.
It says Jujitsu sued,
you know,
discipline.

1577
01:47:07.380 --> 01:47:10.590
Anyway,
go on the chocolate store.com you can see him all and women's shirts.

1578
01:47:10.650 --> 01:47:13.740
Women's shirts are new.
Back to the patches real quick.

1579
01:47:13.860 --> 01:47:16.480
So I got a recommendation for the velcro.
One is,

1580
01:47:17.220 --> 01:47:21.060
I don't even know why I didn't like it.
Didn't dawn on me.
You don't wear a hat?

1581
01:47:21.450 --> 01:47:25.860
Oh yeah.
You don't wear hats.
Yeah,
but still I had all the time.

1582
01:47:26.640 --> 01:47:29.250
There's always a space for a patch on there,

1583
01:47:29.251 --> 01:47:32.730
so I'm going to put it on everything.
There you go.
Anyway.

1584
01:47:33.660 --> 01:47:37.770
What about the women's shirts?
Women's shirts.
Okay.
Yes.
Thank you Debbie.

1585
01:47:37.800 --> 01:47:42.670
And um,
you know all you guys,
every one of the female troopers.
I got it.

1586
01:47:46.210 --> 01:47:47.043
Yeah.
At least

1587
01:47:48.650 --> 01:47:51.500
they're on you employee.

1588
01:47:52.740 --> 01:47:56.530
They bring very good input and I think him and I respect their tenacity.

1589
01:47:56.531 --> 01:48:00.750
You feel threatened?
I felt that we were all in this together,
you know.

1590
01:48:01.440 --> 01:48:04.070
Um,
but yeah.
Thank you.
So yes,
they are coming here.
Here's the thing.

1591
01:48:04.090 --> 01:48:08.400
They're not tee shirts.
Their tank tops.
Cool.
Do we want t shirts?

1592
01:48:08.940 --> 01:48:11.640
I don't know.
If we do then we're going to be few shirts as well.
Good.

1593
01:48:11.890 --> 01:48:16.800
Ask ass females.
Female troopers.
Maybe we'll do a pink.
We will not.

1594
01:48:16.830 --> 01:48:21.450
Maybe we will though.
That's the thing.
We will not,
either way they are in the,

1595
01:48:21.451 --> 01:48:25.730
literally in the works submitted is that Lisa's like pink,
pink,
pink man.
Ooh,

1596
01:48:26.690 --> 01:48:28.900
not happen.
Yes.
Vetoed.

1597
01:48:29.160 --> 01:48:33.360
I didn't really feel like doing the pink either.
So guess what?
I did the paint.

1598
01:48:34.200 --> 01:48:37.260
Actually I didn't do the pink,
but it's in the works still.
Nonetheless.

1599
01:48:37.270 --> 01:48:40.260
They're on the way on the way if you don't want this is decentralized command

1600
01:48:40.261 --> 01:48:43.980
folks.
I'm not micromanage and echo and he's got the creative brain so you know,

1601
01:48:44.040 --> 01:48:45.060
let them run with it.

1602
01:48:45.120 --> 01:48:49.440
And humility because just cause it's not your specific opinion doesn't mean
it's,

1603
01:48:49.441 --> 01:48:52.410
you know,
but

1604
01:48:54.530 --> 01:48:59.310
there is a standard of,
so hopefully you maintain it.

1605
01:48:59.400 --> 01:49:02.760
I guess I'd just be,
you know,
I'll try and give you the proper guidance.
Right.

1606
01:49:03.000 --> 01:49:07.470
Well there you can talk to make that happen Jocko.
store.com.

1607
01:49:07.740 --> 01:49:09.690
That's it.
That's where they all shop.

1608
01:49:09.900 --> 01:49:12.030
And thanks everyone for shopping and supporting.
It's awesome.

1609
01:49:13.290 --> 01:49:17.700
And should we go to the questions?
Oh wait,
one more thing.

1610
01:49:17.730 --> 01:49:19.390
Just a little technical thing.
Okay.

1611
01:49:19.590 --> 01:49:23.130
Outside of the u s if you're outside of the US,
Canada or anywhere else,

1612
01:49:23.131 --> 01:49:24.210
I do the US.
Um,

1613
01:49:25.680 --> 01:49:29.510
I put a little thing on there cause just w as far as just the shipping process,

1614
01:49:29.540 --> 01:49:33.090
technical thing.
Um,
for customs,
they want you,

1615
01:49:33.120 --> 01:49:35.730
your phone number to create this shipping label.
I need a phone number.

1616
01:49:36.480 --> 01:49:38.970
I'm not going to give the phone number out.
I'm not gonna call no one texts.

1617
01:49:38.971 --> 01:49:40.860
Nobody.
But they just need it for the customers.

1618
01:49:42.090 --> 01:49:45.510
So I've tried to put a thing on there,
but hey look,
you're shopping.

1619
01:49:46.200 --> 01:49:50.620
You just want to check out and be done with it.
I understand.
But if,
if possible,

1620
01:49:50.621 --> 01:49:51.940
try to Chyna,
remember that one?

1621
01:49:52.050 --> 01:49:57.010
<v 0>Otherwise you've got to email them.
It's no problem.
I'll email for for good.
Yeah.</v>

1622
01:49:57.011 --> 01:50:01.470
Hey,
look,
ship along way.
Exactly right.
In this Cleo,
in Holland,

1623
01:50:04.440 --> 01:50:05.520
there's so many people.

1624
01:50:05.580 --> 01:50:08.100
This is what's really cool is getting feedback from people all over,

1625
01:50:08.520 --> 01:50:12.360
all over the world.
That's crazy,
right?
Yup.
That's kind of crazy,
right?
Yes.

1626
01:50:12.361 --> 01:50:16.380
He's all over the world troopers getting after it.
Yeah,
it makes sense.

1627
01:50:18.330 --> 01:50:22.710
People come in from
Sweden.
Yup.

1628
01:50:23.660 --> 01:50:27.150
Well they came in,
came to the gym.
Didn't roll though,
but we hung out.

1629
01:50:27.151 --> 01:50:28.020
We talk about physics,

1630
01:50:28.950 --> 01:50:33.580
properties of physics to fit good physicist listening,

1631
01:50:33.900 --> 01:50:37.890
physicist that.
Guess what?
He likes to listen to the podcast.

1632
01:50:38.640 --> 01:50:41.670
We don't talk about physics.
Okay.
Yeah.

1633
01:50:42.540 --> 01:50:43.930
<v 3>Indirectly you did.
But yeah,</v>

1634
01:50:43.990 --> 01:50:48.400
if you can try to remember the phone number.
So it just,

1635
01:50:48.520 --> 01:50:53.140
it seems the step and boom,
it's on.
It's on its way to you quicker.
There it is.

1636
01:50:53.170 --> 01:50:54.670
I don't mind emailing.
No.
In fact,

1637
01:50:54.671 --> 01:50:57.160
I get a lot of cool little conversation like the Australia,
you guys,

1638
01:50:57.161 --> 01:51:00.430
for some reason I love those guys.
They'll be like,
hey,

1639
01:51:00.490 --> 01:51:03.190
and they'll say the Australian stuff.
I was in Australia,
you know,

1640
01:51:03.220 --> 01:51:06.460
a couple of years ago or whatever,
and Medscape,
Jason,

1641
01:51:06.490 --> 01:51:09.550
he's a black belt under Hickson and he has it.
Anyway,

1642
01:51:10.480 --> 01:51:14.050
I was with him doing some stuff and he teach me all the Australian stuff that,

1643
01:51:14.051 --> 01:51:17.500
and some I didn't know,
like too easy,
for example,
too easy.
It's like,
yeah,

1644
01:51:17.501 --> 01:51:20.980
I got this.
Yeah.
Like all the like,
yeah,
it's just this real,

1645
01:51:21.010 --> 01:51:25.270
it's kind of ambiguous,
but it,
you know,
I love that phrase anyway.
Nonetheless.

1646
01:51:25.271 --> 01:51:28.080
You know,
you get into fun conversations with people when you email them for,

1647
01:51:28.450 --> 01:51:33.430
for the simple stuff,
for the shirt order,
whatever.
Good,
good.

1648
01:51:35.520 --> 01:51:38.310
<v 0>How long have we been,
how long have,
how long did that go?</v>

1649
01:51:40.260 --> 01:51:43.620
Oh yeah,
roughly two hours roughly.

1650
01:51:46.580 --> 01:51:50.310
All right.
Well,
I actually got a pretty good stack of questions.

1651
01:51:51.290 --> 01:51:53.460
Um,
I'm thinking that

1652
01:51:55.050 --> 01:51:57.030
for today and we wrap it

1653
01:51:58.560 --> 01:52:03.560
and hold off on Q and a until the next one and we'll just do all Q and a on the

1654
01:52:05.701 --> 01:52:09.390
next one.
I don't do be quite frank with you.

1655
01:52:09.391 --> 01:52:13.230
It's Kinda tough to even follow up with this book.

1656
01:52:14.730 --> 01:52:15.563
So,

1657
01:52:19.140 --> 01:52:19.973
so with that,

1658
01:52:21.540 --> 01:52:25.560
thanks everybody out there for,
for listening,

1659
01:52:26.460 --> 01:52:28.170
for supporting the podcast.

1660
01:52:29.730 --> 01:52:34.730
Thanks for taking the time to learn with me,

1661
01:52:36.360 --> 01:52:38.640
to remember with us

1662
01:52:42.490 --> 01:52:46.370
the depth
of the world,

1663
01:52:46.880 --> 01:52:49.940
the depth of the darkness

1664
01:52:51.840 --> 01:52:52.673
<v 2>and</v>

1665
01:52:54.190 --> 01:52:55.780
<v 0>the sacrifices</v>

1666
01:52:57.820 --> 01:53:00.220
that have been made

1667
01:53:02.370 --> 01:53:03.203
for us.

1668
01:53:07.110 --> 01:53:09.960
And
remember that.

1669
01:53:15.320 --> 01:53:16.250
Remember that,

1670
01:53:17.750 --> 01:53:22.750
remember these men and what they were really truly afraid of,

1671
01:53:25.580 --> 01:53:28.400
not afraid of physical agony,

1672
01:53:28.760 --> 01:53:31.550
not afraid of death itself,

1673
01:53:32.450 --> 01:53:36.140
but they feared losing their future.

1674
01:53:39.040 --> 01:53:42.160
They feared losing their future.

1675
01:53:43.740 --> 01:53:44.540
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1676
01:53:44.540 --> 01:53:46.910
<v 0>So we here</v>

1677
01:53:48.870 --> 01:53:49.800
sitting here

1678
01:53:51.470 --> 01:53:52.303
<v 2>today,</v>

1679
01:53:54.640 --> 01:53:58.150
<v 0>we have a future.
We have that opportunity.</v>

1680
01:54:01.520 --> 01:54:04.460
So make sure you take every

1681
01:54:05.960 --> 01:54:10.960
possible advantage of the opportunity that you have

1682
01:54:14.150 --> 01:54:16.130
and that you have in the future.

1683
01:54:21.620 --> 01:54:22.780
And you know how to do that.

1684
01:54:22.880 --> 01:54:23.713
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

1685
01:54:25.820 --> 01:54:28.610
<v 0>you do that by getting out there.</v>

1686
01:54:31.070 --> 01:54:32.080
They're getting after it.

1687
01:54:36.710 --> 01:54:39.770
And so until next time,

1688
01:54:42.260 --> 01:54:44.660

1689
