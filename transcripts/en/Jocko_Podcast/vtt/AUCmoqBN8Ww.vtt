1
00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.230
I'm a sergeant and I want to know how to deal with my men in a way without

2
00:00:04.231 --> 00:00:08.310
punishment,
but still make them better for next time.
Okay,

3
00:00:08.311 --> 00:00:09.450
here's something for you.

4
00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.860
Punishment is actually the last straw in how you deal with people that you're in

5
00:00:17.101 --> 00:00:19.560
charge of.
In fact,
I will tell you this,

6
00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:25.250
if I ever had to punish someone when I had to administer punishment on my

7
00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.850
troops,
I always felt that I had somewhere I had,
I done something wrong,

8
00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.740
right?
Like even if a guy got in trouble out in town,
got drunk,

9
00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.500
got in a fight,
did something stupid,

10
00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.840
I would still look at that and think to myself,

11
00:00:39.841 --> 00:00:44.841
how could I have allowed this guy to not realize what a disaster it is,

12
00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:46.770
how much trouble he's going to get in,

13
00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.200
what kind of international incident he's going to cause,

14
00:00:49.201 --> 00:00:51.960
how that's going to hurt us in the team strategically.
All of those things.

15
00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:53.010
How did I let that happen?

16
00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:58.310
So doling out punishment is not optimal.
I mean you've,

17
00:00:58.311 --> 00:00:59.460
you've pretty much,

18
00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:03.060
you've pretty much made a mistake if you have to punish people because if you're

19
00:01:03.061 --> 00:01:06.390
doing,
if you're being a good leader,
people are doing what you want them to do.

20
00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:07.650
There's no reason for punishment.

21
00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.730
So that's what you should not be looking to punish.
And just like I just said,

22
00:01:11.731 --> 00:01:14.370
you should be looking to build relationships.

23
00:01:14.371 --> 00:01:18.840
You should be looking to show people a better way of doing things,

24
00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.810
a way that's more smooth and more efficient.

25
00:01:21.811 --> 00:01:24.600
It doesn't disrupt what the team efforts are.

26
00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.930
You got to explain to people why they're doing what they're doing.

27
00:01:27.931 --> 00:01:32.280
This is all stuff,
right?
This is why.
Explain why things are done a certain way.

28
00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.140
Explain how it impacts the team.
Explain how it impacts them.

29
00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:40.540
That's also important.
Um,

30
00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:46.160
you got to have people rehearse in and retrain.

31
00:01:47.701 --> 00:01:50.070
Cause now,
now I'm talking about how do you get people to do the right thing,

32
00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.640
right?
Without punishing them.
So we're trying to avoid punishment.

33
00:01:53.641 --> 00:01:55.140
How do we avoid punishment by training?

34
00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:57.870
How do we avoid punishment by people understanding what they're doing,

35
00:01:57.871 --> 00:01:58.830
why they're doing what they're doing?

36
00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:03.990
How do we avoid punishment by setting goals that make sense,

37
00:02:03.991 --> 00:02:06.000
that are small enough for them to get to.

38
00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:07.900
<v 1>Okay.</v>

39
00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:11.020
<v 0>And then have fun with the goals and get in the game yourself and show them that</v>

40
00:02:11.021 --> 00:02:11.920
you're not perfect

41
00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:17.590
and that is what you need to do.

42
00:02:17.591 --> 00:02:22.591
You need to make every effort to make people understand why they're doing what

43
00:02:24.971 --> 00:02:27.010
they're doing,
how they fit into the big picture.

44
00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:30.250
And when they figure all that stuff out and they're on board,

45
00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:34.950
you shouldn't have to punish people.
You shouldn't have to punish people.

46
00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:40.740
So I know it's,
yeah,
that's what it is.

47
00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:42.930
If you're a sergeant and you want to deal with your minimum away without

48
00:02:42.931 --> 00:02:46.200
punishment,
well think of what the mistakes you're making when you're,

49
00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:50.720
when you're,
when you're fire team or your,
your,

50
00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:52.600
your platoon does something wrong.

51
00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:54.490
Why did they make that mistake that they make the mistake?

52
00:02:54.491 --> 00:02:58.030
Because they wanted to know they made it because you were a bad leader at that

53
00:02:58.031 --> 00:03:01.620
point in time.
You what could you do better?
Hey guys,
where,

54
00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:03.700
what didn't you understand?
Oh,

55
00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:06.910
you guys messed up this training operation.

56
00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:08.920
I'm going to restrict your weekend duty.

57
00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:13.000
I'm going to restrict you to weekend duty.
Meaning you can't go out in town.

58
00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:18.040
What good did I just do?
Right?
Are they going to try harder now,

59
00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:22.090
right?
Yeah,
but if you say,
hey listen guys,
we did a bad job.

60
00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:24.580
I know I must've made a mistake in trying to

61
00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:30.400
explain this information to you all because we didn't do what we were supposed

62
00:03:30.401 --> 00:03:33.970
to do.
Let's look.
Let's dissect this thing.
As a matter of fact,

63
00:03:33.971 --> 00:03:35.800
let's spend Friday night dissecting this thing.

64
00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:40.830
I'm buying pizza and we'll sit around the the a sand table and we'll figure out

65
00:03:41.831 --> 00:03:44.770
what,
what we did wrong.
That's not punishment.

66
00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:49.360
That has the opposite effect of punishment that has,
hey,

67
00:03:49.361 --> 00:03:52.750
I'm bringing everyone in cause I want to win.
I want us all the wind.

68
00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:58.660
So that's what you gotta do.
Don't.
Punishment should be punishment.

69
00:03:58.661 --> 00:04:02.170
Should be,
I mean,
do you have to punish people sometime?
Yes.
Yes you do.

70
00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:05.770
When they're blatantly out align,
when they do something that's blatantly wrong,

71
00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:09.460
yeah,
you got to drop the hammer on them.
You've got to set the example sometimes,

72
00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:12.400
hey,
you're not gonna get away with us.
Sometimes that happened in the dreams.

73
00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:13.061
You know,

74
00:04:13.061 --> 00:04:17.830
somebody who would do something stupid and the command would just drop the

75
00:04:17.831 --> 00:04:22.270
hammer and everyone goes,
man,
that guy got a DUI and they s you know,

76
00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:25.090
docked him,
dig,
dig,

77
00:04:25.091 --> 00:04:28.540
busted him in rank and they pulled him out of his platoon and they're sending

78
00:04:28.541 --> 00:04:32.350
him to a,
to a fleet,
bill it for two years.
Like,
oh my God,

79
00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:34.750
that might make someone think right.
You know,

80
00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:36.460
maybe I won't step behind the wheel.

81
00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:40.990
So sometimes you do have to punish her if people do something stupid,

82
00:04:40.991 --> 00:04:44.500
especially after they've been warned a couple of times.
But I always look,

83
00:04:44.501 --> 00:04:48.070
if I have to deliver punishment onto my team,

84
00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:50.320
I made a mistake somewhere and I'm like,

85
00:04:50.321 --> 00:04:53.950
it don't they say that like reward and encouragement.

86
00:04:53.951 --> 00:04:55.540
It's like way more powerful than punish.

87
00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:57.940
Definitely wouldn't have powerful way more powerful for sure.

88
00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:03.740
I almost never punished people.
Yeah,

89
00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:08.410
but the reason is why did I punish people?
Because people were doing,

90
00:05:08.411 --> 00:05:11.410
weren't doing stupid things.
They were doing what they were supposed to be doing.

91
00:05:11.411 --> 00:05:16.180
They were doing.
Yeah.
I mean,
I probably,
I don't even know if I,
I probably,

92
00:05:16.181 --> 00:05:19.720
I think I had like a one or two captain's mass where I had to bring somebody in

93
00:05:19.721 --> 00:05:23.650
and drop the hammer on them and it's good.
They did dumb stuff.
It's like,
Eh,

94
00:05:23.651 --> 00:05:28.240
you know what?
You can't do that.
I didn't think of it.
I'm sorry,

95
00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:32.710
but you can't do that
discussions.
Yeah.
