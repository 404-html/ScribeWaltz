This is Jocko podcast number one 73 with Echo Charles and me,

2
00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:08.280
Jocko Willink.
Good Evening Echo.
Good evening.

3
00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:11.043
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

4
00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:13.550
<v 0>sure.
Analyzed the wound.</v>

5
00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.700
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

6
00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:17.410
<v 0>Wallin was bleeding from his neck,</v>

7
00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:22.480
so he pulled out gauze and started examining the wound to assess the damage.

8
00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:26.350
Wallins airway looked fine.
There was no vascular damage.

9
00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:29.650
The medic could tell that the wound wasn't life threatening,

10
00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:34.180
but the blood was still flowing.
You're going to be okay.
He said,

11
00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:38.440
wrapping gauze on the wound.
He began exerting pressure to stop the bleeding.

12
00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.350
Are you sure Wallen asked?
Yes.
I'm sure

13
00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:44.370
the fire was nonstop.

14
00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:45.470
<v 1>Okay,</v>

15
00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.921
<v 0>sure.</v>

16
00:00:45.921 --> 00:00:50.921
Didn't think it could get much worse until he heard a frantic call from Walton

17
00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:53.140
on the radio bear.

18
00:00:53.141 --> 00:00:57.460
Miralis and Ck K had been hit and they needed sure up there fast.

19
00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.760
Did you hear that and asked?
Yeah,
I heard it.
Sure,
sure.
Said

20
00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.850
his bleeding was minimal.
I'm good wall and said,
go get them.

21
00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:13.240
Getting the Waltons team though posed a great risk.

22
00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:14.110
<v 1>Okay.</v>

23
00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:17.500
<v 0>A medic is taught not to put himself in any unnecessary danger.</v>

24
00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.050
He has to stay alive so other soldiers can live.

25
00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:28.770
But it had reached a point in the battle where he had to go so sure,

26
00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:33.630
grabbed his bag
and headed into the fire.

27
00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:42.260
And that is a passage from a book called no way out.

28
00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:47.320
A story of valor in the mountains of Afghanistan by an author named Mitch Weiss.

29
00:01:48.071 --> 00:01:49.220
And it tells the story

30
00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:55.520
of the men of operational detachment Alpha three three three six.

31
00:01:55.521 --> 00:02:00.521
It's a special forces ODA team going after a high value target in the shock

32
00:02:00.561 --> 00:02:01.880
value in Afghanistan.

33
00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:07.220
But when they got on the ground for this mission,

34
00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:08.680
<v 1>okay,</v>

35
00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:09.513
<v 0>they were</v>

36
00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:10.820
<v 1>okay</v>

37
00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:14.150
<v 0>in a bad tactical position.
They were outnumbered,
they were outgunned,</v>

38
00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:20.030
but they did have one thing that could not be beaten and that was the will to

39
00:02:20.031 --> 00:02:23.930
survive.
And the bonds of brotherhood that could not be broken.

40
00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:27.630
And on top of those things,

41
00:02:27.631 --> 00:02:32.631
there was incredible courage on display from all the men of the team above and

42
00:02:33.211 --> 00:02:36.030
beyond the call of duty.
And one of those men.

43
00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:37.880
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

44
00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:41.390
<v 0>the medic,
Ron sure fought not only against the enemy,</v>

45
00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:45.290
but fought to save the lives of his teammates.

46
00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:52.490
And it is an absolute honor to have Ron here with us tonight to share some of

47
00:02:54.391 --> 00:02:59.391
the lessons from that day in Afghanistan and

48
00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:05.190
<v 2>from the rest of the things that he's been through and live through on his</v>

49
00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:11.380
journey through life.
So Ron,
thanks for coming on man.

50
00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:12.940
Thanks so much for having Mei.

51
00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:18.100
Have honestly been a fan of the show for a long time and you know when you guys

52
00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:23.470
offered
kind of weird to think about coming on,

53
00:03:23.471 --> 00:03:28.360
but it's definitely a pleasure.
Well man,
it's great to meet you and uh,

54
00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:31.750
you know,
we'll get to shark valley but you know,
let's,

55
00:03:31.751 --> 00:03:35.650
let's figure it out a little bit about who you were,
where you came from,

56
00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:36.760
how you grew up.

57
00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:40.960
I know one interesting fact to start this thing off is that you are born on

58
00:03:40.961 --> 00:03:44.520
December 7th Pearl Harbor Day.
He was born December 7th,

59
00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:49.180
a obviously a few years later then in 1941.
But yeah,

60
00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:53.290
I grew up with that and for some reason my parents always thought it was a good

61
00:03:53.291 --> 00:03:56.430
idea to like get me news articles or,

62
00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:00.820
or other reporting from Pearl Harbor and says like a six or seven year old,

63
00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:06.010
hey,
read this.
I don't know why,
but yeah,
I'd always just,

64
00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:10.900
you know,
was,
was it something that,
that we talked about as,
as part of my,

65
00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:16.180
uh,
my birthday and happy birthday.
Let me tell you about Pearl Harbor side.

66
00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:18.990
Exactly.
Yeah.
And in your group,

67
00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:23.650
was your grandfather in your grandfather served?
My grandfather did serve,

68
00:04:23.651 --> 00:04:28.030
he was in the navy,
so he was in the Pacific for several years.
He,

69
00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:30.280
I'm trying to remember,

70
00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:35.200
he was on the smaller aircraft carriers that they had on the Pacific.
Um,

71
00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:40.270
you said he's on several of those aircraft mechanic and dodging kamikaze.

72
00:04:40.381 --> 00:04:41.800
He's and for sure and other things.

73
00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:46.890
I got a bunch of books on the Mq from World War II sailors and World War II.

74
00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:49.660
It's,
those books are absolutely insane.

75
00:04:49.661 --> 00:04:52.900
And what those guys lived through was horrific.

76
00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:56.740
I look at that and maybe this is just me,

77
00:04:56.770 --> 00:05:01.770
I don't know how you feel if given the option of being in an engine room on a,

78
00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:06.340
on a destroyer in World War II,

79
00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:09.790
hot sweating and by the way kamikaze,

80
00:05:09.791 --> 00:05:12.460
he's like you said or two repeaters are going to slam into you at anytime and

81
00:05:12.461 --> 00:05:15.880
there's nothing you can do about it versus storming the beach.
All stone,

82
00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:19.480
the beach all day long.
Like that's me.
I Dunno.
Oh,

83
00:05:19.481 --> 00:05:21.580
100% I would rather,

84
00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:25.600
you know in land warfare combat,

85
00:05:25.601 --> 00:05:27.340
like if you're going to shoot me,

86
00:05:27.341 --> 00:05:30.130
I got a chance to show you the back and maybe this will work out my way.

87
00:05:30.131 --> 00:05:31.140
Maybe it works out your way,

88
00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:36.150
but we throw water in and all those other pressures like no thanks pass.

89
00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:40.090
Yeah,
I know I owe,
I owe it to those sailors to,

90
00:05:40.091 --> 00:05:42.700
to cover some of those books in there.
Those are those books.
But you know,

91
00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:46.210
with your,
with your grandfather,
I mean,
just to live through that.

92
00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:49.900
I can't even imagine coming back from that what your normal life is like after

93
00:05:49.901 --> 00:05:54.670
you've lived through World War II as a,
as a sailor in the Pacific theater.

94
00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:58.190
Ugh,
man.
Crazy.
Yeah.
My,
my grandfather,

95
00:05:58.190 --> 00:05:59.900
<v 3>he served in the Pacific.
Um,</v>

96
00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:04.960
my great grandfather was in world war one shooting artillery at,

97
00:06:05.511 --> 00:06:09.300
uh,
at the Germans.
Um,
so we had that family history and,

98
00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:14.260
and uh,
we have some family history.
He goes back all the way to the civil war.
Uh,

99
00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:16.190
it gets a little,
you know,

100
00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:19.730
little more like cousin level and everything are there.
But yeah,
they,

101
00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:22.970
we've been fighting wars for this country for a long time.

102
00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:26.180
Both of your parents as well.
But both my parents were in the air force.

103
00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:31.400
That's where they actually met,
was in the air force.
And
Yeah,

104
00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:33.080
we've just had that family history of service.

105
00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:35.870
<v 2>That was,
so that was pretty normal.
AndW and where were they stationed?</v>

106
00:06:35.871 --> 00:06:37.190
What'd you spend most of your childhood?

107
00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:41.810
<v 3>Uh,
I think like most military,</v>

108
00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:43.870
you know who kids?
Um,

109
00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:47.680
I mean I was born in Alaska but then moved to Illinois to run.

110
00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:52.400
Remember any of either of those places?
First by sire member is a mountain home,

111
00:06:52.401 --> 00:06:53.234
Idaho,

112
00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:58.010
which is just like tiny little place about an hour south of Boise.

113
00:06:58.670 --> 00:07:01.070
And then from there I kind of,

114
00:07:01.071 --> 00:07:05.570
we'll call Washington state home cause I spent fourth grade on growing up in

115
00:07:05.571 --> 00:07:08.020
Washington state.
Yeah.
My,

116
00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:11.090
my dad end up retiring in,

117
00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:16.340
I want to say 91 from the air force and then we just kind of stayed there

118
00:07:16.341 --> 00:07:17.174
afterwards.

119
00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:21.820
<v 2>And the and you were the only child?
Yeah.
So that would means those,</v>

120
00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:26.200
those birthdays were especially heavy.
He was like pure celebrate.

121
00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:29.930
I got four kids.
I know you've got two kids.
I've got four kids and you know,

122
00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:34.570
you can have a birthday and you don't even,
am I a bad parent?
I Dunno.
Probably,

123
00:07:34.571 --> 00:07:36.800
yeah,
probably.
Yeah.
Cause of birthday.
Oh,
you know,

124
00:07:36.970 --> 00:07:40.060
are we doing anything for my birthday?
I don't know.
When's your birthday today?

125
00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:44.410
Oh,
okay.
Anyways,
it's my life.

126
00:07:44.411 --> 00:07:47.050
Blows it out for our kids' birthday.
She's,
she's great at that.

127
00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:51.130
I just kind of go along for the ride and my wife does a much better job than I

128
00:07:51.131 --> 00:07:54.970
do as well.
I'm the person that's looking at the whole situation saying,

129
00:07:54.971 --> 00:07:59.920
what does this stuff hanging up for?
Oh,
what did I get him for his birthday?

130
00:08:01.180 --> 00:08:05.740
Yeah.
Uh,
and then,
so going to school,
where were you playing sports?

131
00:08:05.741 --> 00:08:08.890
What were you doing?
What was your Gig?
And in,
in school,

132
00:08:09.310 --> 00:08:13.630
<v 3>uh,
I played the usual sports growing up,
you know,
soccer,
baseball,</v>

133
00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:18.490
um,
what I really kind of gravitated,
gravitated towards as a,

134
00:08:18.491 --> 00:08:22.960
as I kept growing up was your endurance sports.
So I started,

135
00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:25.890
my dad was doing triathlons,
so I started doing that.
Oh,

136
00:08:25.900 --> 00:08:30.520
your dad was doing triathlons.
So he did the,
he did many triathlons.

137
00:08:30.521 --> 00:08:32.290
He did the Canadian iron man a couple of times.

138
00:08:32.950 --> 00:08:34.780
And so it kind of grew up watching that.

139
00:08:34.781 --> 00:08:39.781
So I started with the triathlons in high school and then pretty quickly switched

140
00:08:39.791 --> 00:08:44.530
over to just cycling road road racing,
cycling.
And I don't know.
I think,

141
00:08:45.460 --> 00:08:50.110
I think those,
you know,
four or five,
six hour days on a bike got me ready for,
uh,

142
00:08:50.900 --> 00:08:53.910
<v 2>yeah.
Military Training.
I just know he's coming in on a bike.
Right,
right.</v>

143
00:08:53.940 --> 00:08:55.890
I'll never raised a bike before.
I know

144
00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:59.220
<v 3>guys that race bike and it's just pain.
It's just how much pain can you take?</v>

145
00:08:59.221 --> 00:08:59.910
Right.

146
00:08:59.910 --> 00:09:04.680
Basically you were long stretch of road and you just keep on riding

147
00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:08.790
and,
and apparently you've gotten some kind of crash.

148
00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:15.290
Oh,
several times.
Well,
I know that,

149
00:09:15.390 --> 00:09:19.320
I know that there's a little disruption in your plans because you get done with

150
00:09:19.321 --> 00:09:21.690
high school and you want to join the Marine Corps or you get done with college,

151
00:09:21.691 --> 00:09:23.730
you want to join the Marine Corps.
Okay.
So,
yeah,

152
00:09:23.750 --> 00:09:25.980
I went to Washington State University,

153
00:09:25.981 --> 00:09:30.981
was getting ready to graduate in the spring of 2001 and so started talking to a

154
00:09:32.311 --> 00:09:36.970
Marine Corps
officer,
recruiter.
Um,

155
00:09:36.990 --> 00:09:39.300
what did that process,
how'd your mom and dad feel about that?

156
00:09:40.620 --> 00:09:43.320
They were as this space,
the air force is one side of the spectrum.

157
00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:48.210
Marine Corps on the other side of the spectrum.
At least,

158
00:09:49.140 --> 00:09:53.670
at least I was gonna I was talking about the officer's side when I later said,

159
00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:58.200
hey,
I'm joining the army enlisted.
Then they just,
they just lost it.

160
00:09:58.201 --> 00:10:02.730
Then they're like,
what are you doing?
You just,
but um,

161
00:10:03.060 --> 00:10:06.400
yeah,
so that was getting ready to graduate Washington state,
um,

162
00:10:06.570 --> 00:10:10.380
start talking to the marine corps and went through the process.

163
00:10:10.410 --> 00:10:11.840
We basically,
that was,

164
00:10:11.841 --> 00:10:16.841
it was accepted through the Marine Corps program to go to ocs starting in

165
00:10:17.251 --> 00:10:19.830
October of 2001.
That's awesome.
Um,

166
00:10:20.070 --> 00:10:22.670
but the navy medical board had seen,

167
00:10:23.510 --> 00:10:27.250
<v 4>um,
well I thought it was a flag on my,</v>

168
00:10:27.460 --> 00:10:30.860
my medical records from being hit by a car in 1995.

169
00:10:31.850 --> 00:10:36.650
And sorry,
I never spent a day in the hospital back then with pancreatitis,

170
00:10:36.710 --> 00:10:39.530
which usually would be considered,

171
00:10:40.170 --> 00:10:43.520
are related to drug abuse,
alcoholism,

172
00:10:43.700 --> 00:10:48.560
just something serious,
or you have some serious medical condition.
And,
uh,

173
00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:53.730
so because of that they told me no and I August of 2001 that now we're,

174
00:10:53.750 --> 00:10:58.730
we're good.
We don't,
we don't need anybody.
Um,
so yeah,

175
00:10:58.840 --> 00:10:59.680
Kinda,
yeah.

176
00:11:00.130 --> 00:11:03.730
<v 3>Got left out to dry there.
And then,
so then what was your plan?
Uh,</v>

177
00:11:04.370 --> 00:11:06.470
from there I started at graduate school.
Uh,

178
00:11:06.510 --> 00:11:10.670
and economic original degree in that was business economics.
Did you do,

179
00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:13.130
were you getting that degree but you knew you wanted to go in the military?

180
00:11:13.370 --> 00:11:16.730
I mean you,
you or did you get done with your degree in say,
oh no,

181
00:11:16.731 --> 00:11:17.570
what am I going to do now?

182
00:11:18.100 --> 00:11:22.350
Maybe I'll go in the marine corps a little bit of both.
Um,

183
00:11:22.730 --> 00:11:26.130
so service was definitely always a part of our

184
00:11:26.450 --> 00:11:27.580
<v 4>family life growing up.</v>

185
00:11:28.150 --> 00:11:33.150
And so it's definitely in the back back of my mind like I need to give back,

186
00:11:33.581 --> 00:11:37.990
do something for the country.
Never quite knew what.

187
00:11:38.530 --> 00:11:39.363
And then

188
00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:46.440
trying to go to ocs just seemed like something to do for a while and give back.

189
00:11:46.901 --> 00:11:48.220
And then when that didn't work out,

190
00:11:49.660 --> 00:11:53.680
I started a graduate school to

191
00:11:55.060 --> 00:11:58.780
<v 3>use that as kind of a reset time.
I figured out,
okay,
that's not working out.</v>

192
00:11:58.781 --> 00:12:02.530
Now what can I do?
And you know,
it was a few weeks into that,

193
00:12:02.531 --> 00:12:06.070
that nine 11 happened and then we had to revisit,

194
00:12:06.790 --> 00:12:08.020
revisit the decisions again.

195
00:12:09.110 --> 00:12:12.140
<v 5>And so then what did you do once a,
once a September 11th happened,</v>

196
00:12:13.280 --> 00:12:17.110
<v 3>uh,
so I was in graduate school for Economics and um,</v>

197
00:12:17.810 --> 00:12:21.800
and I'm spending,
spending that first year,
uh,

198
00:12:21.850 --> 00:12:25.870
continuing with education and just watching,

199
00:12:26.830 --> 00:12:31.830
watching it on TV and just didn't feel right to sit there and watch it.

200
00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:37.570
Um,
so try to figure out what,

201
00:12:37.900 --> 00:12:42.340
what made sense at that point too to do.

202
00:12:42.341 --> 00:12:45.310
And then for some reason,
enlisting in the army sounded like a good idea.

203
00:12:47.950 --> 00:12:50.530
So,
so that,
uh,

204
00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:55.750
summer of 2002 I went down an army recruiter and of course at that time they

205
00:12:55.751 --> 00:12:58.460
were like,
sure,
we'll take your weekend.
We can scratch that

206
00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:07.300
<v 5>now.
Did you,
did you know you wanted to try for SF at that point?</v>

207
00:13:07.930 --> 00:13:10.240
<v 3>Um,
they,</v>

208
00:13:10.390 --> 00:13:15.390
they talked to me about going in with a SF contract and it definitely sounded

209
00:13:16.361 --> 00:13:17.194
interesting,

210
00:13:18.100 --> 00:13:22.990
but I know part of me just didn't feel

211
00:13:25.250 --> 00:13:28.990
like,
like,
oh the,
I could be an SF guy.

212
00:13:28.991 --> 00:13:32.710
Cause I mean I grow up just like everybody.
We were watching Rambo,

213
00:13:32.711 --> 00:13:34.930
you're watching other things.
Like that's what a green baret is,

214
00:13:34.940 --> 00:13:38.630
like certainly don't,
don't fit that mold.
Um,

215
00:13:39.490 --> 00:13:43.690
but so they talked about that,
but I was like,
well,
let me get in,

216
00:13:43.691 --> 00:13:48.490
let me get some experience in the military and then we'll go from there.
So I,

217
00:13:48.820 --> 00:13:52.630
I signed up to be a medic who did basic training.

218
00:13:53.620 --> 00:13:57.100
Uh,
oh,
I'm forgetting the name right now,
Fort Jackson,

219
00:13:57.940 --> 00:13:58.721
South Carolina,

220
00:13:58.721 --> 00:14:03.340
and then went off to Fort Sam Houston and then went to airborne school.

221
00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:05.290
And along that way I got,

222
00:14:05.470 --> 00:14:10.470
I ended up getting myself a ranger contract to try and go to the center for the

223
00:14:11.831 --> 00:14:12.664
Rangers.

224
00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:15.560
<v 5>So at some point you,
you realized,
all right,</v>

225
00:14:15.561 --> 00:14:20.090
I'm going to step up and try and go to a little bit more special operations
side.

226
00:14:20.450 --> 00:14:21.380
Something got in your head.

227
00:14:21.810 --> 00:14:26.040
<v 3>Yeah,
I'm got in my head.
Um,
and if I remember correctly,</v>

228
00:14:26.041 --> 00:14:27.510
I think it was orders to Korea.

229
00:14:30.630 --> 00:14:33.290
I think that was my,
the,
the first thing that came through.
It was like a,

230
00:14:33.291 --> 00:14:38.180
let me see what else I could do.
So I,
I talked to their recruiters,

231
00:14:38.190 --> 00:14:41.100
got,
got the,
uh,
the ranger.

232
00:14:43.860 --> 00:14:46.140
I don't know if it was a contract at that point,
but I got that set up.

233
00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:49.680
So it might be different now,
but after,

234
00:14:49.681 --> 00:14:54.681
after airborne school and any infantry guys or ray or medics or whoever's trying

235
00:14:55.011 --> 00:14:59.060
to go to,
to the ranger,
you,
you'd go out the next day,

236
00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:03.140
wait on the little lines out there at airborne school and they'd come by,

237
00:15:03.141 --> 00:15:07.970
they look through your paperwork,
pick you up,
and then take you,
take you over.

238
00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:09.440
So they come out,

239
00:15:09.830 --> 00:15:14.420
they start flipping through everybody's stuff and they get to mine and they

240
00:15:14.421 --> 00:15:18.200
start looking at my paperwork,
which is still the same paperwork from,

241
00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:21.680
I'm trying to do the Marine Corps ocs thing.

242
00:15:21.710 --> 00:15:25.910
And so it's of course a disaster.
It's,
you know,

243
00:15:26.330 --> 00:15:27.620
not physically qualified,

244
00:15:27.621 --> 00:15:32.030
but then there's like lines through that and waivers and arrows and just

245
00:15:32.850 --> 00:15:35.890
nonsense.
Um,
but I look at that and they're like,
well,
you're not,

246
00:15:35.930 --> 00:15:39.770
not physically qualified to be
here.

247
00:15:40.370 --> 00:15:44.180
And so they just kind of drop my paperwork.
It took everybody else and left me,

248
00:15:45.080 --> 00:15:46.880
left me standing there.
Um,

249
00:15:47.630 --> 00:15:50.990
so now had to revisit a what to do again.

250
00:15:51.860 --> 00:15:56.600
So I ended up spending a few weeks sitting there.

251
00:15:56.601 --> 00:16:01.070
Everyone's goal just to kind of being,
you know,
a little,

252
00:16:01.730 --> 00:16:06.530
you know,
whatever they needed done that sucked.
They'd,
they'd make me do a while.

253
00:16:06.531 --> 00:16:11.110
I waited on new orders to go somewhere.
Um,

254
00:16:12.360 --> 00:16:15.670
yeah,
we did.
I did that for a little while and I finally got orders,
uh,

255
00:16:15.671 --> 00:16:19.940
up to Fort Bragg to go to the 44th medical command.

256
00:16:21.450 --> 00:16:25.670
Um,
and so while I was packing up all my stuff,

257
00:16:27.590 --> 00:16:31.060
head up to Fort Bragg and fortunately,
uh,
my,

258
00:16:31.190 --> 00:16:35.000
my medical records got lost along the way.
Did you say?
Fortunately,

259
00:16:35.060 --> 00:16:38.900
and unfortunately I'm a specialist in the army,
you know,

260
00:16:39.310 --> 00:16:43.010
I don't want to lose stuff and show up,
but it,
it got lost along the way.

261
00:16:45.370 --> 00:16:50.260
So,
uh,
medical paperwork read,
done,
none of that.
Wow.
Uh,

262
00:16:51.530 --> 00:16:56.000
none of those waivers or anything.
Got All that situated,
um,

263
00:16:56.900 --> 00:17:00.950
reported to my unit on,
I think it was a Thursday,

264
00:17:00.951 --> 00:17:05.120
some Thursday and in August had been 2003 at that point.

265
00:17:06.270 --> 00:17:06.930
Uh,

266
00:17:06.930 --> 00:17:08.380
<v 5>well that's because those,
those army,</v>

267
00:17:08.470 --> 00:17:10.510
the medic schools are a long time basically.

268
00:17:10.600 --> 00:17:13.390
So that at this point you'd been through bootcamp,

269
00:17:13.480 --> 00:17:16.810
Army boot camp and then you went to are to be a medic.

270
00:17:16.811 --> 00:17:19.480
How long is the training to be a,
like an infantry medic?

271
00:17:19.840 --> 00:17:24.250
<v 3>Uh,
the men of course was four months.
Yeah.
Okay.
So I did basic,</v>

272
00:17:24.251 --> 00:17:26.220
I did the,

273
00:17:26.221 --> 00:17:30.700
the medic school and then you had an airborne school and then that interim time

274
00:17:30.701 --> 00:17:34.870
while they try and figure out something to do with me.
And so I showed up to my,

275
00:17:35.050 --> 00:17:38.350
my unit went after you in process in August of 2003.

276
00:17:39.690 --> 00:17:44.680
Um,
you know that first day we do PT.
Then the first sergeant calls me,
I'm like,

277
00:17:44.681 --> 00:17:45.880
Hey,
what do you want to do with your,

278
00:17:45.940 --> 00:17:50.120
your life plan on putting in an SF packet and try this,

279
00:17:50.490 --> 00:17:54.060
<v 2>try something else again.
And,
and again,
the thing that's drug,</v>

280
00:17:54.061 --> 00:17:57.180
what's driving you to do that?
Like,
did you see some SF guys?

281
00:17:57.181 --> 00:18:00.240
Did you talk to some SF guys?
Did you watch Rambo again?

282
00:18:01.650 --> 00:18:03.010
What was the persuading of accurate?

283
00:18:06.760 --> 00:18:08.530
<v 4>I don't know.
I think it was</v>

284
00:18:12.060 --> 00:18:14.490
<v 2>mixture of a lot of different emotions.</v>

285
00:18:14.940 --> 00:18:18.630
<v 4>And
I'd had enough</v>

286
00:18:18.870 --> 00:18:23.490
<v 2>validate my feelings because I was just some specialist in the army.</v>

287
00:18:23.491 --> 00:18:27.240
But I was like,
I think I'm pretty good at this stuff,
so let me,

288
00:18:27.480 --> 00:18:32.100
let me try and push myself a little bit harder and try and find something else

289
00:18:32.101 --> 00:18:36.780
to do.
So I,
I put in for SF,
there's a guy named Travis mills.

290
00:18:36.781 --> 00:18:41.000
He rehearsed Travis Mills.
He's an awesome guy,
but he,
we,

291
00:18:41.030 --> 00:18:43.560
he was on the podcast and,
and he's a,

292
00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:47.040
he's a quadruple amputee amputee and he's like the,
uh,

293
00:18:47.220 --> 00:18:50.340
got the damn spirit of a,
of a freaking,

294
00:18:51.030 --> 00:18:55.020
like the ultimate human being warrior.
But anyways,

295
00:18:55.200 --> 00:18:59.610
when he was growing up,
he played varsity football and basketball,
whatever.

296
00:18:59.611 --> 00:19:04.170
He played every sport.
He broke all these records.
He was this big strapping guy,

297
00:19:04.171 --> 00:19:08.250
taught like a total stud,
just,
just a total stud.

298
00:19:09.030 --> 00:19:11.520
And you know,
I asked him,
I said,
well,
you know,

299
00:19:11.550 --> 00:19:14.360
how come you didn't try for Rangers?
Somebody said,
he's like,

300
00:19:14.390 --> 00:19:16.720
I do or why don't you try for special forces?
He's like,
I didn't,

301
00:19:16.770 --> 00:19:21.660
I didn't think I could make it.
And there's like this thing where like for me,

302
00:19:21.720 --> 00:19:22.380
I,
I'm,

303
00:19:22.380 --> 00:19:27.380
I'm one eighth of the athlete and the physical specimen that Travis mills is,

304
00:19:29.040 --> 00:19:32.370
but I was just dumber,
which is dumb enough to say,

305
00:19:32.640 --> 00:19:35.550
oh I think I can make it through this training,
bring it on.
You know,

306
00:19:35.820 --> 00:19:39.990
he was too smart to to say,
you know,
he was too smart thing.
She was too humble,

307
00:19:40.020 --> 00:19:42.360
really too humble.
Cause I had some level of arrogance.

308
00:19:42.361 --> 00:19:44.250
I mean I think there's a difference between,

309
00:19:44.580 --> 00:19:48.060
cause that happens on a fairly regular basis,
you know,

310
00:19:48.090 --> 00:19:53.090
special operations and special forces has this kind of mythical buildup where

311
00:19:54.660 --> 00:19:57.600
people start to think,
well I dunno if I can actually make it through that.

312
00:19:57.601 --> 00:20:00.720
It's gotta be so hard.
Whereas I'm always looking at people like,
oh,

313
00:20:00.721 --> 00:20:02.820
you were a wrestler,
or Oh,
you played football,

314
00:20:02.821 --> 00:20:04.970
varsity football and your high school,
or you,

315
00:20:05.160 --> 00:20:08.850
you swam on the swim team or whatever,
you'll be fine.
Like you can do it.

316
00:20:09.030 --> 00:20:12.990
But people build it up to that mythical level that you don't think you can make

317
00:20:12.991 --> 00:20:14.690
it.
So I,
the reason I was asking that,
cause it's,

318
00:20:14.740 --> 00:20:18.090
it sounds like you made a transition from,
I don't know if I can do that.

319
00:20:18.120 --> 00:20:19.920
And then once you're there and you're looking around,
you're going,

320
00:20:19.921 --> 00:20:23.850
you don't want to take,
I can actually do that.
You got,
you either got dumber

321
00:20:27.040 --> 00:20:29.190
or you just got more,
you know,
little,
and that's what I think it is.

322
00:20:29.191 --> 00:20:30.900
I think it is,
you know,
you see,

323
00:20:31.320 --> 00:20:35.100
you see yourself in comparison with everyone else's there and you go,
okay,
cool.

324
00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:38.330
I'm,
I'm hanging with these guys.
I can probably make this happen.
So no,

325
00:20:38.360 --> 00:20:39.390
that's cool.
That's cool.

326
00:20:41.160 --> 00:20:46.090
<v 4>Um,
yeah.
And so,
so now we're talking,</v>

327
00:20:46.870 --> 00:20:48.070
uh,
that fall

328
00:20:48.070 --> 00:20:52.180
<v 3>2003.
So Afghanistan's role in Iraq is,</v>

329
00:20:52.840 --> 00:20:57.370
is going,
uh,
at that time that the unit I was in the,

330
00:20:57.430 --> 00:21:02.150
it was a medical sport company.
They weren't even supposed to deploy.

331
00:21:02.151 --> 00:21:04.570
I think the calendar had them going in like 2005.

332
00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:07.690
So like you're like that's a lifetime away.

333
00:21:07.720 --> 00:21:10.960
I came all the way here to not go anywhere.

334
00:21:10.961 --> 00:21:15.010
So I put in for selection,
we got uh,
we got,

335
00:21:15.170 --> 00:21:19.120
got those medical records redone.
So I go,

336
00:21:19.770 --> 00:21:20.603
um,

337
00:21:20.710 --> 00:21:25.710
so I went in January of 2004 to selection and now we can always talk about that

338
00:21:27.131 --> 00:21:27.490
more.

339
00:21:27.490 --> 00:21:32.490
But when I came back then my unit is all in desert camouflage uniforms and link.

340
00:21:33.130 --> 00:21:35.650
You guys,
you guys go on somewhere and they're like,

341
00:21:35.651 --> 00:21:37.210
why have things changed in those three weeks?

342
00:21:37.211 --> 00:21:41.980
You were gone for going and I'm like four weeks.
Oh,
so,
so you went to special Ed.

343
00:21:41.980 --> 00:21:45.670
So they send you,
they send you like ta di to special forces selection.

344
00:21:45.910 --> 00:21:49.480
Is that what happens?
Like temporary,
they don't transfer you there permanently.

345
00:21:49.481 --> 00:21:53.170
They just send you for a correct for the,
for the three weeks selection process,

346
00:21:53.171 --> 00:21:57.640
you just get temp orders over,
you do your thing.
If you get selected,

347
00:21:58.120 --> 00:22:02.230
then you wait for orders to go full time to the Q course.

348
00:22:02.380 --> 00:22:06.910
And then that initial selection is just like a beat down.
Yeah,
three weeks.

349
00:22:06.970 --> 00:22:09.940
Um,
you know,

350
00:22:10.570 --> 00:22:13.870
probably not a different than most selections for different soft units around

351
00:22:13.871 --> 00:22:17.530
the world.
It'll don't walk in the woods with heavy bags.
Get lost,

352
00:22:17.620 --> 00:22:22.180
then we're going to make you carry heavy stuff.
And I remember logs,

353
00:22:22.181 --> 00:22:26.260
a lot of logs.
Then he did carry it.
Apparently they didn't belong over here.

354
00:22:26.261 --> 00:22:30.880
They belonged over there.
How'd you do in that?
Did you feel all right?

355
00:22:31.630 --> 00:22:35.550
Uh,
I mean honestly,
uh,

356
00:22:36.790 --> 00:22:41.620
I didn't know what I was getting myself into,
so I obviously passed.

357
00:22:41.621 --> 00:22:42.454
I got selected,

358
00:22:42.730 --> 00:22:47.730
but I didn't feel like I was where I wanted to be for that process.

359
00:22:47.840 --> 00:22:48.100
Um,

360
00:22:48.100 --> 00:22:52.870
it definitely beat me up more than I thought it should and it,

361
00:22:53.380 --> 00:22:54.370
it helped reset me.

362
00:22:54.371 --> 00:22:57.850
So I spent the next couple of months when I was getting ready for those orders.

363
00:22:58.330 --> 00:23:02.530
Really resetting the way I was training was getting,

364
00:23:02.770 --> 00:23:05.260
getting myself mentally prepared for it.

365
00:23:05.261 --> 00:23:09.970
And so once I got to the phase two of the course,

366
00:23:11.050 --> 00:23:16.050
I thought that was how you were a little older cause you did college and this

367
00:23:16.121 --> 00:23:21.121
was 2004 so I was at that point 25 was that older for maybe 26 it was going

368
00:23:25.001 --> 00:23:28.570
through a non for no,
not for special forces.

369
00:23:29.110 --> 00:23:34.110
I was definitely one of the oldest guys at basic training when I was going

370
00:23:34.241 --> 00:23:38.350
through.
But for,
for special forces,

371
00:23:38.860 --> 00:23:43.260
it tends to be those older guys who've been in the army for a little while of

372
00:23:43.430 --> 00:23:45.070
I've seen stuff,
got some experience,

373
00:23:45.170 --> 00:23:48.200
then decided they wanted to explore some different routes.

374
00:23:48.740 --> 00:23:52.670
So you come back from the initial selection course in all your guys are in

375
00:23:52.671 --> 00:23:55.370
desert Gamey and they're getting rich.
So did they end up deploying quickly?

376
00:23:55.820 --> 00:23:59.840
They deployed a couple of weeks later the to deploy to Iraq or Afghanistan.

377
00:24:00.110 --> 00:24:03.950
They went to Iraq.
Did they?
Did they,
did they run the cash in Baghdad?

378
00:24:05.960 --> 00:24:09.350
Some of them were east doing,

379
00:24:09.950 --> 00:24:14.510
I want to say they were doing prisoner.
Hmm.
Uh,
you know,

380
00:24:14.670 --> 00:24:18.900
DTT support patients or whatever,
some of the prisons.
Um,

381
00:24:19.490 --> 00:24:24.490
but luckily my company commander pulled me in in the other office and basically

382
00:24:25.911 --> 00:24:30.620
said,
yeah,
you're on these orders
but if you want to,

383
00:24:31.210 --> 00:24:34.970
if you want to go pursue something else,
I see some value in that.

384
00:24:35.030 --> 00:24:35.900
So if you want to go,

385
00:24:36.590 --> 00:24:40.520
you can go and see your company commander took care of you and said you can go

386
00:24:40.521 --> 00:24:43.550
to the Q course.
Yeah.
That's awesome.

387
00:24:43.670 --> 00:24:48.170
You know what's cool about that is that God just leaves a good impression on you

388
00:24:48.171 --> 00:24:49.820
about the army.
You know what I mean?

389
00:24:49.880 --> 00:24:54.880
I was thinking that when I was a young enlisted guy and somebody could either,

390
00:24:56.300 --> 00:24:59.150
you know,
maybe screw you over is a hard term,
but you know,

391
00:24:59.151 --> 00:25:02.330
some could either like look out for you or just kind of let the big green

392
00:25:02.331 --> 00:25:05.060
machine do its thing and when someone actually looks out for you,

393
00:25:05.061 --> 00:25:09.710
just give you such a much better appreciation and connection to,

394
00:25:09.860 --> 00:25:10.370
you know,

395
00:25:10.370 --> 00:25:14.210
like I had guys that looked out for me when I was a new guy and I always that

396
00:25:14.570 --> 00:25:18.080
that just heightens your commitment to the team.
You know,

397
00:25:18.110 --> 00:25:21.410
that there's people like that.
Whereas the people that try and you know,

398
00:25:21.500 --> 00:25:24.680
oh you're just going to do this anyways needs of the navy.
That's what they say.

399
00:25:24.800 --> 00:25:27.080
The in the,
in the navy they say needs of the navy.

400
00:25:27.710 --> 00:25:31.790
Those are the needs of the navy so well,
and you're going to get some.

401
00:25:31.960 --> 00:25:35.030
And so after my company deployed,
basically are,

402
00:25:35.360 --> 00:25:38.990
our battalion had four companies to deployed to stayed behind.

403
00:25:39.710 --> 00:25:43.460
So we kind of fell under the two that had stayed behind.

404
00:25:44.240 --> 00:25:48.410
And there was some people over there who had that attitude of you think you're

405
00:25:48.411 --> 00:25:51.860
better than us?
I like,
I,
I don't,
I'm just trying something different.

406
00:25:51.861 --> 00:25:54.650
And so they made life interesting for a little while,

407
00:25:54.890 --> 00:25:59.270
but we got through it and,
and then so what did you train?

408
00:25:59.300 --> 00:26:01.010
What did you change differently about your training?

409
00:26:01.340 --> 00:26:02.960
Where you learn from selection?
Like,
okay,

410
00:26:02.961 --> 00:26:06.500
I need to work on humping a Rockmore or whatever.
What was the,

411
00:26:06.501 --> 00:26:10.610
what were the big things that you learned you needed to work on a more weight

412
00:26:10.611 --> 00:26:15.210
and moving faster?
I mean,
not too,
um,
it's,

413
00:26:15.230 --> 00:26:19.130
it's pretty simple really,
man.
I'm not a big guy.
I'm five,

414
00:26:19.220 --> 00:26:24.110
six at the time I went to selection,
I think it was about 135 pounds.
So you,

415
00:26:24.230 --> 00:26:27.500
you put on that way and it's,
it's a lot.
So I put on some more weight.

416
00:26:27.501 --> 00:26:31.670
I just got a little more used to,
to move in with that.

417
00:26:31.671 --> 00:26:33.890
And because you've got to carry,

418
00:26:33.891 --> 00:26:36.860
it doesn't matter if you weigh 220 pounds or 120 pounds,

419
00:26:36.861 --> 00:26:38.920
you've got to carry the same weight.
Right?
Yeah.

420
00:26:38.921 --> 00:26:42.170
Had the packing list is what it is.
The minimum wait for the day is what it is.

421
00:26:42.171 --> 00:26:46.290
It doesn't matter if you're six foot three or four or five foot six,

422
00:26:46.440 --> 00:26:50.310
you're just going to go get some.
And then how was the Q course?

423
00:26:51.560 --> 00:26:55.410
Qrs and Silva.
I thought it was really,
really good course.
I thought it,

424
00:26:55.640 --> 00:27:00.640
I thought he did a great job getting you ready for things.

425
00:27:00.720 --> 00:27:04.230
I had no experience in a,
so it's all,

426
00:27:04.380 --> 00:27:08.940
it's all changed around a little bit since then.
But so for me,
when I showed up,

427
00:27:09.420 --> 00:27:13.230
you got a three of a small unit tactics portion.
Basically learn how to

428
00:27:15.420 --> 00:27:18.960
be an infantryman,
which from from being a medic,

429
00:27:18.990 --> 00:27:20.670
I mean I had the basic training experience,

430
00:27:20.671 --> 00:27:23.070
but I didn't know anything really about that.

431
00:27:23.071 --> 00:27:27.270
So he spent about a month and a half and should learning how to move with,

432
00:27:27.720 --> 00:27:32.430
with a,
a small unit,
you know,
just the basic military drills,

433
00:27:32.431 --> 00:27:35.130
break contact,
initiate an bushes,
those things.

434
00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:40.110
And then from there we started the medical course,

435
00:27:40.170 --> 00:27:44.470
which for SF medics is a,
is a year.
Um,

436
00:27:45.960 --> 00:27:50.400
basically just learning every single thing they could teach us in a year.

437
00:27:51.310 --> 00:27:55.950
You know,
of course trauma,
medicine,
heavily enforced.

438
00:27:55.951 --> 00:27:57.760
And then,
you know,

439
00:27:57.780 --> 00:28:02.780
just all the weird and random diseases you might see around the world.

440
00:28:03.211 --> 00:28:08.070
Did I,
I actually met my future wife during the medic course.
Um,

441
00:28:08.490 --> 00:28:13.170
and so when I go see her on the weekends I'd pull out,
you know,

442
00:28:13.770 --> 00:28:16.890
medical manuals and be like,
all right,
start,
you know,

443
00:28:16.891 --> 00:28:18.300
start grilling me on these things.

444
00:28:18.301 --> 00:28:23.301
And so she pretend she had whatever random disease you could get in data from

445
00:28:23.311 --> 00:28:26.770
around the world.
It was,
it was pretty fun.
Date nights he had over,

446
00:28:28.290 --> 00:28:31.410
I dunno why she and she put up with it,
but she did.
And

447
00:28:32.370 --> 00:28:33.870
<v 5>so where were you when you were were,</v>

448
00:28:33.930 --> 00:28:37.760
where's that chunk of the course take place?
Is that,

449
00:28:37.770 --> 00:28:41.580
that's 18 delta,
right?
Yeah.
Rolling through the 18 delta?
No,
of course.

450
00:28:42.120 --> 00:28:45.810
All the ESF core,
the Q chorus was a hall I'll based at Fort Bragg,

451
00:28:46.420 --> 00:28:47.620
<v 3>so I was already at Fort Bragg,</v>

452
00:28:47.621 --> 00:28:51.280
so really I just had to move across post when I started.

453
00:28:52.060 --> 00:28:52.893
And then

454
00:28:53.950 --> 00:28:57.010
<v 5>are they,
when you're going through 18 delta,
are they still,</v>

455
00:28:57.040 --> 00:29:00.970
are you still doing tactical physical evolutions or is it like really starting

456
00:29:00.971 --> 00:29:04.960
to get focused on classroom really focused on the,
the,
the,

457
00:29:05.020 --> 00:29:08.350
the medical aspect of stuff.
There's

458
00:29:09.210 --> 00:29:13.200
<v 3>a lot of classroom stuff cause they got a lot of,
yeah you got to teach you.</v>

459
00:29:13.201 --> 00:29:13.860
But they do,

460
00:29:13.860 --> 00:29:18.860
they also do a great job of pulling out in the woods and um,

461
00:29:20.790 --> 00:29:23.920
can't remember all the different segments of the chorus.

462
00:29:23.930 --> 00:29:25.320
We have a combat trauma lanes.

463
00:29:25.321 --> 00:29:29.580
You have just so many different portions where you get used to,
you know,

464
00:29:29.581 --> 00:29:33.540
training people out in,
out in the dirt.
And I remember,

465
00:29:34.870 --> 00:29:39.870
I'm sorry,
I think I started that course in
August,

466
00:29:39.871 --> 00:29:44.871
September of 2004 and so we were rolling through the winter and I still

467
00:29:45.611 --> 00:29:50.611
distinctly remember being out in the woods in January when it's like 15 degrees

468
00:29:50.771 --> 00:29:54.010
and you're the patient and you know,
like somebody there,

469
00:29:54.100 --> 00:29:58.030
somebody is working on you,
you know,
to practice and you're like,

470
00:29:58.090 --> 00:30:03.010
please do it faster.
So I can,
I can get out of this because you know,

471
00:30:03.011 --> 00:30:06.160
you,
how do you treat a patient who has wounded,

472
00:30:06.161 --> 00:30:09.100
you have to expose removers,
roads.

473
00:30:09.910 --> 00:30:13.620
So they'd be going through stuff and they'd be like,
you know,
you know,

474
00:30:13.630 --> 00:30:17.710
do you feel this or do you feel that?
And like the patient saying yes,
but no,

475
00:30:17.711 --> 00:30:22.400
I don't feel that cause my,
my feet are frozen right now.
Um,

476
00:30:23.380 --> 00:30:27.400
but so it was,
it was a great course.
Um,
we did

477
00:30:29.170 --> 00:30:34.170
two one month blocks where you go out to hospitals around the country and work

478
00:30:35.681 --> 00:30:40.060
in the ers or work with,
uh,
anywhere in the hospital,

479
00:30:40.240 --> 00:30:42.760
ob,
just different aspects.
Uh,

480
00:30:43.510 --> 00:30:47.830
go to the local fire houses right on the ambulances,
get those experiences.

481
00:30:49.650 --> 00:30:50.980
<v 0>So yeah,
the,</v>

482
00:30:51.270 --> 00:30:55.680
the medical training that the UN and the seals used to go to 18 delta are
sealed.

483
00:30:55.740 --> 00:30:58.530
Corpsman used to go to 18 delta.
Yeah.
They don't want any more.

484
00:30:58.531 --> 00:31:00.510
Now they have a separate course.
Okay.

485
00:31:00.660 --> 00:31:04.220
But the training that they got and the training of that,

486
00:31:04.730 --> 00:31:09.150
the course provided,
it's just awesome training.
I mean,
it's a legendary,

487
00:31:09.240 --> 00:31:10.073
awesome training.

488
00:31:10.320 --> 00:31:15.320
And who knows how many lives have been saved because guys went through that,

489
00:31:16.500 --> 00:31:21.500
that block of training and we're just so good and at doing all this stuff under

490
00:31:22.321 --> 00:31:25.230
a Poncho at night stop and bleeding,
working on,
you know,

491
00:31:25.860 --> 00:31:30.120
healing people with all kinds of,
you know,
in inclement weather,
in the dirt,

492
00:31:30.121 --> 00:31:31.740
like you said,
all that stuff.
There's the,

493
00:31:31.741 --> 00:31:35.790
the training that they prepped our medical guys four was phenomenal.

494
00:31:36.450 --> 00:31:37.283
<v 3>Yeah,</v>

495
00:31:38.880 --> 00:31:42.990
I was super impressed having been a medic before and then kind of stepping

496
00:31:44.580 --> 00:31:47.340
it up a level like that.
It was,
he was really,

497
00:31:48.690 --> 00:31:53.690
really nice to see where we're going to take a year or we're going to really

498
00:31:53.940 --> 00:31:58.740
take our time,
teach you everything you need to know from the ground up.
Um,

499
00:32:00.960 --> 00:32:03.420
yeah.
And just to continue to build those basics,
you know,

500
00:32:03.480 --> 00:32:08.430
from starting early on with,
you know,
classes,
sticks and rags.
Like,
okay,

501
00:32:08.490 --> 00:32:11.760
everything else is going to be great.
We're going to teach you that stuff.

502
00:32:11.761 --> 00:32:16.380
But you know,
sometimes this is literally just a stick in a rag.

503
00:32:16.440 --> 00:32:17.780
You can stop a lot of stuff.

504
00:32:17.830 --> 00:32:21.420
You can save a lot of people along as you've had that experience and then of

505
00:32:21.421 --> 00:32:25.620
course moving on later to usually he must attic agents,
you know,

506
00:32:25.621 --> 00:32:29.340
to like quick clot or something like that.
It really stopped by like,
okay,

507
00:32:29.341 --> 00:32:34.341
this is easy now because I had to stop at last week with literally go find a

508
00:32:34.501 --> 00:32:39.260
stick and cut up some clothes,
tee shirt.

509
00:32:39.660 --> 00:32:40.100
Now you're giving

510
00:32:40.100 --> 00:32:43.550
<v 2>me actual materials like,
okay,
I got this.
Going back to the Q course,</v>

511
00:32:43.560 --> 00:32:45.020
the initial kickoff of the Q course,

512
00:32:45.050 --> 00:32:49.310
was there anything that you had major issues with?
What do you mean?

513
00:32:49.370 --> 00:32:53.810
Like when you were going through,
not selection,
but through the Q course,

514
00:32:53.900 --> 00:32:55.970
was there anything that you would like,
I'm not going to make it through this.

515
00:32:56.240 --> 00:32:58.970
I'm going to fail this.
I'm not good enough at this.
Like for me,

516
00:32:59.090 --> 00:33:00.230
I wasn't really good at anything.

517
00:33:00.800 --> 00:33:05.800
I was like everything that I did because basically every week going through seal

518
00:33:06.081 --> 00:33:09.770
training,
you get tested on,
you get a timed run,
you get a time to swim,

519
00:33:09.980 --> 00:33:14.960
you get a time to obstacle course and then there's usually some kind of a water

520
00:33:15.080 --> 00:33:18.650
evolution that they're going to test you on,
whether it's underwater,

521
00:33:18.651 --> 00:33:21.560
not tying are lifesaving or breath hold or whatever.

522
00:33:22.130 --> 00:33:24.830
They've got these evolutions wearing,
they're stacked up.

523
00:33:25.010 --> 00:33:30.010
And that's one of the biggest pressures that that I felt going through was for

524
00:33:30.201 --> 00:33:34.250
me like to,
to pass a form l timed run,
which the,
when I went through the,

525
00:33:34.251 --> 00:33:38.090
the runs were not for miles.
They were however long they happened to be that day.

526
00:33:38.091 --> 00:33:43.091
They might be 3.8 they might be 4.6 no one knew soft sand,

527
00:33:43.431 --> 00:33:48.050
high tide.
And
I failed one run,

528
00:33:48.290 --> 00:33:51.980
uh,
because I decided I was going to pace myself and that was not smart.

529
00:33:52.010 --> 00:33:53.660
And after that one run,
then I failed.

530
00:33:53.661 --> 00:33:56.270
I just had to go as hard as I could for the whole time.

531
00:33:56.271 --> 00:33:59.270
I had set a sprint as hard as I could and then I pass and it was kind of the

532
00:33:59.271 --> 00:34:03.200
same thing for everything.
Like I just had to go hard,
but you know,

533
00:34:03.201 --> 00:34:07.010
I was worried that,
oh,
I might fail another swim.
I might fail.

534
00:34:07.130 --> 00:34:09.530
Was there anything where you were thinking to yourself,
man,
if I don't,

535
00:34:09.740 --> 00:34:12.110
if I don't pay attention,
I might not make it through this training.

536
00:34:14.010 --> 00:34:17.170
<v 3>Uh,
I'll say any of the,</v>

537
00:34:17.770 --> 00:34:21.340
any of the time we were out in the woods doing infantry stuff cause I just,

538
00:34:21.710 --> 00:34:23.290
I didn't have that experience.

539
00:34:26.380 --> 00:34:30.910
I worked my butt off trying to learn,
trying to pick up,
follow the guy's like,

540
00:34:31.170 --> 00:34:34.360
oh yeah,
that guy is been a ranger school.
He,
he's done this,
he's done.

541
00:34:34.650 --> 00:34:36.740
He started done a combat deployment.
Let me,
yeah,

542
00:34:36.820 --> 00:34:39.070
let me hang out a little closer to that guy and see,

543
00:34:39.550 --> 00:34:42.940
see what he does when we're setting up a patrol base,
those kinds of things.
Um,

544
00:34:44.090 --> 00:34:48.760
but honestly I think like a lot,
a lot of people,

545
00:34:48.761 --> 00:34:51.010
I have that two sides of the coin on me.

546
00:34:51.011 --> 00:34:55.600
Like I have that little bit of dumb arrogance.
Like I the,

547
00:34:55.601 --> 00:34:56.231
I can do this,

548
00:34:56.231 --> 00:35:01.231
but then I also have that I don't belong anywhere near these guys.

549
00:35:01.481 --> 00:35:05.680
Like these guys are,
you know,
they've been,
they're actually done that.

550
00:35:05.681 --> 00:35:08.400
I what have I done?
Um,
so I,

551
00:35:08.401 --> 00:35:13.310
I was always trying to find that balance internally of yeah,
I can do this or,

552
00:35:13.430 --> 00:35:15.040
or,
or no I can't.

553
00:35:15.420 --> 00:35:18.750
<v 2>I guess that's a big difference between when you go through seal training.</v>

554
00:35:18.900 --> 00:35:23.460
Pretty much everyone's going through training is not been done,

555
00:35:23.461 --> 00:35:26.820
not done anything before.
So even,
cause if you might've been the regular navy,

556
00:35:26.821 --> 00:35:28.620
but even most guys haven't even been the regular navy,

557
00:35:28.621 --> 00:35:30.600
most guys are just co you go through boot camp,

558
00:35:30.630 --> 00:35:33.420
you go through prep course and then you go show up at Bud's and that's it.

559
00:35:33.450 --> 00:35:35.340
That's,
that's what you do.
So there's no,

560
00:35:35.550 --> 00:35:38.220
you're not looking at anyone going on how this,
this guy has done

561
00:35:38.250 --> 00:35:42.820
<v 3>stuff before or anything like that.
And also you're not doing anything in,</v>

562
00:35:43.050 --> 00:35:47.340
in basic seal training.
You're just,
there's no tactical,

563
00:35:47.820 --> 00:35:52.820
there's barely any tactical knowledge being taught at all.

564
00:35:53.220 --> 00:35:56.340
It's like carry this boat on your head for a long time.

565
00:35:56.820 --> 00:36:01.160
And it's going to hurt a lot.
And then when it hurts a lot,
keep going.
Right.

566
00:36:01.890 --> 00:36:04.760
I mean,
SF definitely has that aspect too.
Like you've,

567
00:36:05.190 --> 00:36:06.480
if we find the right people,

568
00:36:06.570 --> 00:36:09.330
we can train you at any point on what we want you to do,

569
00:36:09.331 --> 00:36:12.270
but we just got to make sure,
you know,
you're not gonna,

570
00:36:12.350 --> 00:36:16.620
you're not gonna quit on us.
And
I don't know.

571
00:36:16.650 --> 00:36:20.760
I think just along the way,
I was just,
I was too stubborn to quit.

572
00:36:21.300 --> 00:36:24.480
Definitely.
I definitely wanted to all the time,

573
00:36:24.870 --> 00:36:27.870
but you know,
it wasn't gonna give him the satisfaction

574
00:36:29.750 --> 00:36:33.540
and the,
so,
so then you get done with that.
You get done with the Q course,

575
00:36:33.541 --> 00:36:37.650
you get done with 18 delta,
and then when do you get,

576
00:36:37.651 --> 00:36:42.180
when did they give you your green baret?
So,
uh,
for us,

577
00:36:42.270 --> 00:36:46.760
um,
I ended up finishing the entire Q course in May of 2006.

578
00:36:47.130 --> 00:36:50.250
Um,
so I'd done selection in January,
2004,

579
00:36:50.760 --> 00:36:53.340
had a couple of months break while I waited on orders,

580
00:36:53.490 --> 00:36:58.490
started the Q course proper in June of 2004 and then may of 2006 when I,

581
00:36:59.380 --> 00:37:03.880
I graduated.
Dang,
that's a long pipeline isn't it?
It's a long pipeline and that's

582
00:37:05.820 --> 00:37:09.600
zero recycles.
That's zero.
Getting injured.
That's just,

583
00:37:10.050 --> 00:37:11.850
that's just what it is.
Um,

584
00:37:12.810 --> 00:37:17.460
all the other jobs are,
they teach you the job at about three months,

585
00:37:17.461 --> 00:37:20.310
whereas the medic,
they teach it and 12,
12 months,

586
00:37:20.340 --> 00:37:24.870
so everybody else can be that much shorter than,
than our pipeline.

587
00:37:25.670 --> 00:37:27.990
Uh,
but so it was about May,
uh,

588
00:37:28.050 --> 00:37:31.500
that's when I got the bring Brad graduated to the Q course,

589
00:37:32.220 --> 00:37:35.940
got my orders over to a third group.
Did you,
were you married?

590
00:37:35.941 --> 00:37:39.030
Did you get married yet?
So,
uh,

591
00:37:39.120 --> 00:37:43.020
graduated the Q course in May of 2006.

592
00:37:44.040 --> 00:37:44.873
Right?
Yeah.

593
00:37:44.970 --> 00:37:49.970
And so I got that couple week break before reporting to my unit and my wife and

594
00:37:52.801 --> 00:37:55.230
I got engaged.
And then,

595
00:37:55.890 --> 00:38:00.890
so I reported over to third group towards the end of June of 2006 and they say,

596
00:38:02.221 --> 00:38:03.840
hey,
go over to third battalion,

597
00:38:03.870 --> 00:38:07.290
they're going to get you slotted third battalion's like,
Hey,

598
00:38:07.291 --> 00:38:10.350
go to Charlie company.
And I show up to Charlie company three,

599
00:38:10.351 --> 00:38:14.910
three and there's just,
there's nobody there.
Like,
like my,

600
00:38:14.911 --> 00:38:19.230
the first guy here,
like what's going on?
And uh,
there,

601
00:38:19.250 --> 00:38:20.910
there was one guy in there and he was like,
oh,

602
00:38:20.911 --> 00:38:24.600
everybody's on block leave cause we were going to Afghanistan and a couple of

603
00:38:24.600 --> 00:38:29.310
weeks.
So I went home,
told Miranda,

604
00:38:29.800 --> 00:38:33.720
uh,
the situation.
And so we,

605
00:38:34.440 --> 00:38:38.410
we need a quickie marriage but we didn't want to have to try and plan while I

606
00:38:38.411 --> 00:38:42.250
was gone.
And then there's also those aspects of,
you know,

607
00:38:42.590 --> 00:38:47.590
the military doesn't give a damn about some girlfriend or a fiance or anything.

608
00:38:48.460 --> 00:38:53.350
And so we,
you know,
we decided,
you know,
she wants,

609
00:38:54.100 --> 00:38:57.120
you know,
an actual wedding ring and actual dress,
you know,
you know,

610
00:38:57.121 --> 00:38:59.770
these few things.
Can we get them done or we got it done.

611
00:39:00.400 --> 00:39:02.290
So we got married and then I

612
00:39:02.560 --> 00:39:05.180
<v 2>these,
he didn't do a quick wedding but you got married in two weeks,</v>

613
00:39:05.190 --> 00:39:09.870
so it was like three weeks.
That's awesome.
It was,

614
00:39:09.920 --> 00:39:12.250
you know,
it wasn't like a,
a Lope right away.

615
00:39:13.630 --> 00:39:16.800
<v 3>Uh,
cause we'd been together a year and a half at that point.
Um,</v>

616
00:39:17.460 --> 00:39:21.300
so yeah,
it wasn't quick,
but it was,
it was pretty quick.

617
00:39:22.200 --> 00:39:26.820
It's awesome.
You know.
Did your,
did your family,
uh,
how'd you tell your family

618
00:39:29.280 --> 00:39:34.110
<v 2>that text message
at that point in texts?
Really where that they,</v>

619
00:39:34.111 --> 00:39:37.890
cause you had to type so many buttons,
you know,
just to send a message.

620
00:39:38.450 --> 00:39:42.500
<v 3>Um,
so we ended up bringing a,
her parents,
uh,
my parents.
Oh,
that's awesome.</v>

621
00:39:42.501 --> 00:39:46.230
They actually came down.
Yeah.
Oh,
okay.
Yeah,
we actually went,

622
00:39:46.970 --> 00:39:49.970
where do you do a non quickie quick marriage?
Vegas.

623
00:39:50.390 --> 00:39:52.960
So we all met up there.
Oh,
so cool.

624
00:39:53.360 --> 00:39:58.030
So you did a Vegas wedding and we're still going.
I mean,

625
00:39:58.160 --> 00:40:03.050
what this summer will be 13 years.
Uh,
so yes,
we got married.

626
00:40:03.410 --> 00:40:06.550
<v 2>Did you,
did you request permission from your uh,</v>

627
00:40:06.940 --> 00:40:11.350
sergeant to get married?
I did not.
I didn't even meet him.

628
00:40:11.351 --> 00:40:13.180
I just wanted to let you out of the compound.

629
00:40:13.420 --> 00:40:15.800
I just went on because nobody was there.
So they just

630
00:40:15.870 --> 00:40:18.390
<v 3>put me,
as soon as I showed up,
I went right back on leave,</v>

631
00:40:19.260 --> 00:40:21.360
Kinda got married and then it showed back up,

632
00:40:21.420 --> 00:40:26.420
did some training and then met a bunch of guys for the first time and deployed

633
00:40:26.821 --> 00:40:30.750
for seven months with them day.
And,
and what was that first appointment like?

634
00:40:32.220 --> 00:40:36.150
Oh,
the first deployment
was

635
00:40:38.340 --> 00:40:41.180
comparing my second appointment.
It was,
it was fairly tame that

636
00:40:42.890 --> 00:40:45.040
half fall,
2,600,

637
00:40:45.070 --> 00:40:48.660
2007 timeframe and Afghanistan we were,

638
00:40:48.750 --> 00:40:51.280
we were working with the Afghans,
you know,
doing that stuff thing,

639
00:40:51.300 --> 00:40:55.290
partner with them,
drain them,
take them out on missions.
Uh,

640
00:40:56.530 --> 00:40:57.180
I don't,
I would just,

641
00:40:57.180 --> 00:41:02.180
we just ended up and a Gardez Afghanistan and for some reason it was just hard

642
00:41:02.461 --> 00:41:05.550
to find trouble then.

643
00:41:05.580 --> 00:41:10.580
I mean obviously things ebb and flow in different areas and budgets.

644
00:41:10.860 --> 00:41:13.050
At that time we really couldn't find too much work.

645
00:41:13.290 --> 00:41:14.041
<v 2>So were you guys,</v>

646
00:41:14.041 --> 00:41:18.510
you guys were training up these Afghan national police and to build

647
00:41:18.511 --> 00:41:19.410
relationships with them.

648
00:41:19.411 --> 00:41:22.110
And then you'd go out and do some kind of missions with them.

649
00:41:22.470 --> 00:41:26.350
But the ACO that you were in was relatively tame at the time.
Yeah.

650
00:41:27.240 --> 00:41:29.730
<v 3>So,
uh,
yeah,
we work with the,
the army and the,</v>

651
00:41:29.830 --> 00:41:32.260
and the police just training them up,

652
00:41:32.261 --> 00:41:34.880
trying to get them ready to take over their country.

653
00:41:34.881 --> 00:41:39.770
Cause that's the SF mission is to train you up so you can do the job and I can,

654
00:41:40.190 --> 00:41:41.023
I can go home.

655
00:41:41.870 --> 00:41:42.703
<v 6>MMM.</v>

656
00:41:43.520 --> 00:41:47.530
<v 3>Yeah.
Obviously all SF guys want to be the guy to go in and you know,</v>

657
00:41:47.610 --> 00:41:51.960
block the doors,
go in and clear it all yourselves.
But the ESAP mission is to,

658
00:41:52.030 --> 00:41:54.000
you know,
get somebody else to go do it for themselves.

659
00:41:54.430 --> 00:41:57.300
<v 0>Yeah.
Yeah.
That's it.
For those of you that don't know,
that's like that,</v>

660
00:41:57.301 --> 00:42:00.270
that is the tenant of the bid.
That's the mission of the,

661
00:42:00.330 --> 00:42:05.100
of the special forces of the Green Berets is to work with the whatever nation

662
00:42:05.101 --> 00:42:08.880
you're in,
you build up their forces,
you help them,
you train them,
prepare them,

663
00:42:09.270 --> 00:42:12.900
and then you advise them out on the battlefield and hopefully with your goal of

664
00:42:12.901 --> 00:42:17.130
allowing them to eventually not need your advisement anymore.
And that's what,

665
00:42:17.340 --> 00:42:22.200
that's what the primary mission of the special forces is.
And well,

666
00:42:22.230 --> 00:42:27.100
in the seal teams we end up doing that as well.
You know,
we,
I don't know,

667
00:42:27.710 --> 00:42:29.910
I'm trying to think of when we actually started getting tasked with that.

668
00:42:29.911 --> 00:42:33.600
But you know,
we,
that's what we do now to,
you know,
we probably,

669
00:42:33.810 --> 00:42:37.680
we lean towards,
you know,
direct action in special reconnaissance.

670
00:42:37.681 --> 00:42:41.100
That's kind of where we live,
learn,
lean towards you guys,
lean more towards,

671
00:42:41.340 --> 00:42:44.930
you know,
training up guerrilla forces,
but there's a lot of crossover and,

672
00:42:45.110 --> 00:42:49.080
and all of us do everyone else's job to the best of our ability.

673
00:42:49.320 --> 00:42:54.310
But did you,
did you feel like the deployment was like a,

674
00:42:54.311 --> 00:42:55.340
what was your satisfaction,

675
00:42:55.350 --> 00:42:57.810
was your personal satisfaction level of that deployment?

676
00:42:59.220 --> 00:43:02.940
<v 3>Uh,
I,
I think like most has half guys.</v>

677
00:43:02.941 --> 00:43:07.830
You've just gone through alone,
train up,
you've got all this experience,
you're,

678
00:43:08.220 --> 00:43:12.360
you're raring to go.
And I had to pull him in.
I mean,
it was a good trip,

679
00:43:12.361 --> 00:43:13.194
but it was,

680
00:43:13.350 --> 00:43:18.020
it was a little quieter than I think most of the team would have liked.
Yeah.

681
00:43:18.380 --> 00:43:22.320
If you're going to be gone and you're going to miss your family for seven
months,

682
00:43:23.270 --> 00:43:26.570
<v 0>so would you guys,
can we take them out to hit targets and they're just would be,</v>

683
00:43:26.571 --> 00:43:30.320
you'd capture your bad guy or yes or no,
but they born putting up resistance.

684
00:43:30.640 --> 00:43:35.520
<v 3>Yeah.
We,
we did villages.
We would go,
we cop plenty of bad guys.
Um,</v>

685
00:43:37.330 --> 00:43:42.040
just stayed at that point.
I don't know,

686
00:43:42.041 --> 00:43:47.041
I think it was this kind of at a weird point in the war where d bye guys really,

687
00:43:49.480 --> 00:43:50.560
they could quickly spot,

688
00:43:50.590 --> 00:43:55.030
this is SF and they didn't really want too much to do with us,
so they just,

689
00:43:55.420 --> 00:44:00.160
you know,
we'll pass today,
we'll find,
we'll find another unit to attack.

690
00:44:00.770 --> 00:44:01.603
<v 6>MMM.</v>

691
00:44:02.770 --> 00:44:06.460
<v 3>But yeah,
it just,
yeah.
We caught,
we caught guys.</v>

692
00:44:06.461 --> 00:44:10.480
They just always been pretty good.
I'm pretty quickly,
I mean we,

693
00:44:10.930 --> 00:44:14.790
we got in,
we'd get into a,
okay.
You know,
a couple.

694
00:44:15.880 --> 00:44:19.120
Yeah,
just a couple of contacts over there,
but it was

695
00:44:20.090 --> 00:44:20.650
<v 6>okay.</v>

696
00:44:20.650 --> 00:44:25.190
<v 3>Yeah.
Overall it was just kind of quiet area at that time.
Was it wintertime?</v>

697
00:44:26.260 --> 00:44:31.260
So we showed up there in August of 2006 and we stayed till march of two though,

698
00:44:34.440 --> 00:44:36.810
I want to say march of 2007 so yeah,
it was,

699
00:44:37.050 --> 00:44:40.470
is that winter or when you kind of have that low anyways?
Yeah.
Of the,

700
00:44:40.471 --> 00:44:41.340
the winter time.

701
00:44:41.840 --> 00:44:44.820
<v 5>Yeah.
And like you said,
I mean things just go up and down cycles go up and down.</v>

702
00:44:44.920 --> 00:44:45.590
People,

703
00:44:45.590 --> 00:44:50.060
the enemy gets agitated or they get beat down and they take a tactical breath

704
00:44:50.061 --> 00:44:51.620
for a few months or whatever.

705
00:44:53.150 --> 00:44:58.150
And then you come home from that deployment and you're,

706
00:44:58.850 --> 00:44:59.661
so then what happens?

707
00:44:59.661 --> 00:45:01.970
What's the life of an SF guy when you come home from that appointment,

708
00:45:01.971 --> 00:45:03.980
you're going to start a workup to get ready to deploy again.

709
00:45:04.410 --> 00:45:07.130
<v 3>Yeah.
We already knew when we were going again.
Um,</v>

710
00:45:08.700 --> 00:45:10.100
basically the,

711
00:45:11.820 --> 00:45:14.760
at the time there was three battalions ended up standing up a fourth battalion

712
00:45:14.770 --> 00:45:15.820
and in the groups.

713
00:45:15.821 --> 00:45:20.640
So kind of two battalions would be on the next rotation,
one would it be down.

714
00:45:20.641 --> 00:45:24.580
And so it just happened that my battalion had to to uh,

715
00:45:25.170 --> 00:45:29.220
back to back so to speak.
So we had seven on,
seven off and then seven on again.

716
00:45:29.221 --> 00:45:32.100
So we knew right away as soon as we got back when we're going.

717
00:45:33.080 --> 00:45:36.500
<v 5>And then do you,
do you try and cram in a quick work up into that time period?</v>

718
00:45:36.740 --> 00:45:39.890
<v 3>Of course.
So you know,
you got back,</v>

719
00:45:39.891 --> 00:45:44.090
so you got to first refit,
get everything re situated,
make sure,

720
00:45:44.840 --> 00:45:49.610
make sure,
uh,
you know,
all of this stuff.
He broke his is fixed.

721
00:45:50.150 --> 00:45:50.983
Uh,

722
00:45:51.780 --> 00:45:56.780
kinda began to take it a little bit at a time just to decompress.

723
00:45:57.920 --> 00:46:01.520
And then we start the train up and you know,
we got,

724
00:46:01.580 --> 00:46:05.420
got a few new guys in on the,
the team a got a new team sergeant and we got,

725
00:46:05.870 --> 00:46:10.670
got a new team leader,
a couple of other new guys and you know,

726
00:46:10.671 --> 00:46:13.880
just getting everybody ready,
get it on the same page.
Um,

727
00:46:14.810 --> 00:46:18.740
honestly we,
the teams are,
we got Dennis got forward,

728
00:46:18.741 --> 00:46:23.540
he was great coming from me.
Come from some training.
You come from some,

729
00:46:23.960 --> 00:46:28.960
some different SF teams that had been over to Iraq and Afghanistan and had been

730
00:46:31.131 --> 00:46:34.760
there,
you know,
early on in the war when it was,
it's a lot.
So he,

731
00:46:34.910 --> 00:46:36.770
he put us through a lot of training,
got us,

732
00:46:37.370 --> 00:46:41.060
got us much more prepared than we were prepared for the first draft.

733
00:46:41.061 --> 00:46:45.860
But we were even better for the second one.
And Yeah,

734
00:46:45.950 --> 00:46:49.890
we finished up that training.
Do a little bit more about the boys

735
00:46:50.060 --> 00:46:51.980
<v 5>like that when you had the,
the,</v>

736
00:46:52.070 --> 00:46:56.310
the new team sergeant coming in and he's all fired up to push you guys hard and

737
00:46:56.320 --> 00:46:57.420
training was any push back from that.

738
00:46:58.800 --> 00:47:02.980
<v 3>Ah,
of course all of us are,
you know,</v>

739
00:47:03.550 --> 00:47:06.940
SF guys on a little bit like,
you know,
even though he's a teams are,

740
00:47:06.941 --> 00:47:09.540
he's been around forever.
Yeah.
Like,
Oh,

741
00:47:09.550 --> 00:47:12.040
who's this new guy coming in on the GM trying to tell us all what to do.

742
00:47:12.850 --> 00:47:15.880
But you know,
it didn't take very long to see like,
okay,

743
00:47:15.881 --> 00:47:19.990
he's got all this great experience and the training that he's putting us through

744
00:47:20.500 --> 00:47:24.160
was,
it was definitely getting us hurt.
Getting us right eye.
Yeah.

745
00:47:24.220 --> 00:47:27.830
<v 5>And how much,
how much support do you guys get for training?
So do they do,</v>

746
00:47:28.460 --> 00:47:32.710
are you going organized training?
Are you guys running all the training yourself?

747
00:47:33.970 --> 00:47:37.780
<v 4>It's,
the company does coordinate some stuff,</v>

748
00:47:37.781 --> 00:47:42.450
but most of it's just have as heme level.
So,
you know,
the team started,

749
00:47:42.480 --> 00:47:46.810
it's kind of that in coordination with the team later is kind of guiding the

750
00:47:46.811 --> 00:47:49.540
team where they want him to be.
But then,

751
00:47:51.560 --> 00:47:55.880
you know,
as SF is broken down,
you have your weapons sergeants who were,

752
00:47:56.320 --> 00:48:00.590
you know,
supposed to be your weapons experts.
You have your engineers who,

753
00:48:00.640 --> 00:48:03.080
you know,
handle the demolitions and,
and those things.

754
00:48:03.410 --> 00:48:08.150
Your communications guys and your medics.
And so depending on the day,

755
00:48:08.151 --> 00:48:09.770
it might be my day to teach,

756
00:48:09.800 --> 00:48:14.800
so I'm going to get two days this week to just put everybody through many

757
00:48:16.221 --> 00:48:20.570
medical course,
getting them,
get them ready just in case,
you know,

758
00:48:20.670 --> 00:48:21.201
something happens,

759
00:48:21.201 --> 00:48:25.210
I can't get there or something happens to me or something like that.
Um,

760
00:48:25.940 --> 00:48:26.750
so everybody,

761
00:48:26.750 --> 00:48:31.280
everybody is a subject matter expert and just kind of tries to tries to lift

762
00:48:31.281 --> 00:48:35.810
that whole whole team up to be the best they can be.
There's no,

763
00:48:39.010 --> 00:48:42.130
obviously each job is the best at their job,

764
00:48:42.160 --> 00:48:46.150
but you want to know as much as you can about everything so that way

765
00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:50.830
you know when things go wrong men.

766
00:48:50.860 --> 00:48:53.180
And by that point it was kind of still theoretical to me,
but yeah,

767
00:48:53.181 --> 00:48:55.880
when things went wrong.
Okay,
got you,
got,
you can handle this.

768
00:48:57.460 --> 00:49:00.160
<v 5>And then you guys already knew when you were growing deployment and you did you</v>

769
00:49:00.161 --> 00:49:01.750
know where you're going on deployment as well?

770
00:49:05.740 --> 00:49:08.710
<v 4>I don't remember when we found out what our next mission was.</v>

771
00:49:09.520 --> 00:49:11.300
I can't remember if it was early on or it was laying on.

772
00:49:11.301 --> 00:49:15.020
I think it was fairly early on in our buildup,
um,

773
00:49:15.370 --> 00:49:18.520
that we knew we were going to be working this time with the Afghan commandos,

774
00:49:18.910 --> 00:49:21.910
which was a fairly new thing at the time.

775
00:49:22.840 --> 00:49:27.460
It was right around that time that SF teams had just started,
hey Kate,

776
00:49:27.461 --> 00:49:30.160
we're going to go through selection for the Afghan army,

777
00:49:30.161 --> 00:49:32.600
were going to get the best we can.
We're going to train them up more,

778
00:49:32.630 --> 00:49:37.630
start building these Afghan commandos battalions and they're gonna be the SF of

779
00:49:38.890 --> 00:49:43.180
Afghanistan.
So I can remember exactly when,

780
00:49:43.181 --> 00:49:45.460
but we knew we were going to be partnering with those guys

781
00:49:47.650 --> 00:49:48.910
to do a little bit more of this trip.

782
00:49:48.980 --> 00:49:49.320
<v 5>So you,</v>

783
00:49:49.320 --> 00:49:52.400
so your expectation was that things were going to be a little bit hotter on the

784
00:49:52.401 --> 00:49:56.030
second deployment?
Correct.
Did you believe that as a,

785
00:49:56.630 --> 00:49:59.450
as like a one cruise wonder guy that don't,

786
00:49:59.451 --> 00:50:02.480
don't one deployment or are you like things are going to be hotter or were you

787
00:50:02.481 --> 00:50:04.730
just thinking,
Hey,
it's going to be the same as last time?

788
00:50:05.930 --> 00:50:07.960
<v 4>Uh,
I,</v>

789
00:50:09.250 --> 00:50:11.950
I think we all thought it was going to be a little bit more this trip just

790
00:50:12.850 --> 00:50:17.570
because my first trip it was,
you kind of had a little bit more of a,

791
00:50:17.630 --> 00:50:22.420
a region that your team was.
So it just depends on what your region is doing.

792
00:50:22.510 --> 00:50:25.240
Got It.
Whereas this command us could go anywhere.
The commandos,

793
00:50:25.241 --> 00:50:28.460
they were still fairly new so there wasn't that many.
So

794
00:50:28.460 --> 00:50:29.600
<v 3>over the course of the second,</v>

795
00:50:29.780 --> 00:50:32.690
my second deployment and we spent time at eastern Afghanistan,

796
00:50:32.691 --> 00:50:34.040
we spent time down in Kandahar,

797
00:50:34.041 --> 00:50:39.041
we spent time just going wherever they needed another battalion because like I

798
00:50:39.411 --> 00:50:41.180
said,
there wasn't very many.
They were training him up,

799
00:50:41.360 --> 00:50:44.240
but it takes a little while to get,
get guys trained up.

800
00:50:45.590 --> 00:50:46.820
<v 5>So you go on deployment,</v>

801
00:50:46.821 --> 00:50:49.760
you show up there and you started working with the commandos.

802
00:50:49.820 --> 00:50:51.800
How was your relationship with the commandos?
How,
how,

803
00:50:51.980 --> 00:50:53.600
how good were the commandos as you trained him?

804
00:50:54.960 --> 00:50:59.890
<v 3>Uh,
they were,
they were much better than Dan,
you know,</v>

805
00:50:59.891 --> 00:51:03.760
non selected force.
I think that's just

806
00:51:05.590 --> 00:51:07.670
as to be expected.
Um,

807
00:51:10.120 --> 00:51:14.890
you still gonna have those no variances in,
in your,
in your troops.

808
00:51:15.340 --> 00:51:17.350
But we felt more comfortable.

809
00:51:17.630 --> 00:51:20.120
<v 5>So they were,
they were fairly capable crew.</v>

810
00:51:22.970 --> 00:51:23.803
<v 3>They were better</v>

811
00:51:28.670 --> 00:51:32.900
<v 5>understood.
And so you're out there working with these guys and what type,</v>

812
00:51:32.901 --> 00:51:33.950
what types of missions,
where are you doing?

813
00:51:33.951 --> 00:51:36.680
Just basically going after high value targets?

814
00:51:37.990 --> 00:51:42.370
<v 3>Yeah,
yeah,
we would,</v>

815
00:51:42.790 --> 00:51:45.400
we'd get until,
uh,
on a high value target.
We,

816
00:51:47.740 --> 00:51:49.570
you know,
trying to,
again,

817
00:51:49.571 --> 00:51:53.020
going back to trying to train them to do the job for their country.

818
00:51:53.021 --> 00:51:54.100
So we'd work with,

819
00:51:55.170 --> 00:51:59.800
they're the team leader for the team would start working with the,

820
00:52:00.320 --> 00:52:03.640
you know,
the,
the command level over there.
Okay,
this is the objective.

821
00:52:03.890 --> 00:52:08.260
How would you take it?
And then they would kind of coordinate on a battle plan.

822
00:52:08.700 --> 00:52:13.180
Um,
for me,
you know,
I'd make sure they're medics,

823
00:52:14.080 --> 00:52:18.100
you know,
we're,
we're training up getting,
getting ready,
and then,
you know,

824
00:52:18.101 --> 00:52:19.630
when it came time for an actual mission,

825
00:52:20.680 --> 00:52:24.730
then each one of us would have a squad or,

826
00:52:24.760 --> 00:52:26.380
or maybe a few extra,

827
00:52:26.930 --> 00:52:29.270
<v 5>which is,
how big is an Afghan commando squad?</v>

828
00:52:29.690 --> 00:52:33.330
<v 3>I mean they were,
they're built around the same premise as a,</v>

829
00:52:33.780 --> 00:52:37.590
as a are an army,
you know,

830
00:52:37.680 --> 00:52:42.600
light infantry unit.
So you'd have,
you know,
nine,
10 dudes,

831
00:52:43.270 --> 00:52:44.103
um,

832
00:52:44.940 --> 00:52:48.960
just depending on what kind of squad you had with you on any given day.

833
00:52:49.020 --> 00:52:52.970
<v 5>And so then you would be running your squad of Afghan commandos.</v>

834
00:52:53.000 --> 00:52:56.020
Once you're out in the field,
you would,
whatever the whatever,
just from a,

835
00:52:56.760 --> 00:52:59.040
you're no longer just the medic,

836
00:52:59.070 --> 00:53:03.750
you're now a little squad advisor for these Afghan commandos.

837
00:53:04.020 --> 00:53:09.010
<v 3>Yeah.
The,
the,
the medic piece is always there for,</v>

838
00:53:09.040 --> 00:53:13.970
for an 18 delta.
But,
you know,
best medicine is superior firepower.

839
00:53:14.400 --> 00:53:18.490
So if we can,
if we can check,
if we can go,
hey,

840
00:53:18.500 --> 00:53:20.610
we hit him overwhelming for us.
Everybody's good.
We,

841
00:53:20.611 --> 00:53:25.050
when we talking about how tough we are and then we'd go home and,
and uh,
so yeah,

842
00:53:25.170 --> 00:53:30.170
primary role is to advise that squad leader on mon how things going.

843
00:53:33.451 --> 00:53:34.300
And then,
you know,

844
00:53:34.320 --> 00:53:37.440
we also bring all the other assets that the US military comes with all that,

845
00:53:37.980 --> 00:53:41.940
you know,
whether it's helicopter coverage or aircraft coverage.
So we can,

846
00:53:42.480 --> 00:53:45.310
we're getting those,
you know,
that,

847
00:53:45.340 --> 00:53:48.840
that extra intel that we can then push to these guys and be like,
Hey,

848
00:53:49.230 --> 00:53:52.980
this is going on.
This is not going on.
Let's,
let's fix this.

849
00:53:53.080 --> 00:53:56.550
<v 2>Yeah,
no,
for me,
I think it,
I just wanted to kind of bring that out because it's,</v>

850
00:53:56.551 --> 00:53:59.170
it's pretty cool when you think about it.
You know,
you're,
uh,

851
00:53:59.290 --> 00:54:02.260
you could be this young soldier and you're out there and all of a sudden you're

852
00:54:02.320 --> 00:54:04.320
working,
you're,
you're an element leader.
Beat.

853
00:54:04.330 --> 00:54:07.510
You go from just being a medic or just being the demo guy,

854
00:54:07.690 --> 00:54:10.150
we're just being the communicator.
All of a sudden it's like,
Hey,
you know what?

855
00:54:10.240 --> 00:54:13.630
Now you're doing that thing,
but you're also going to be advising,

856
00:54:13.631 --> 00:54:17.410
which often times means you're actually leading this squad of commandos and

857
00:54:17.411 --> 00:54:18.710
you're making sure that they're making the right moves.

858
00:54:18.711 --> 00:54:22.810
So that's a very cool aspect of the job,
in my opinion.
You know?

859
00:54:23.470 --> 00:54:24.370
Yeah.
It was

860
00:54:25.590 --> 00:54:29.460
<v 3>when you could see them getting better,
he was definitely a very rewarding,
and</v>

861
00:54:30.960 --> 00:54:34.530
he as he,
as you see them,
start to take more initiative and start to,

862
00:54:35.970 --> 00:54:39.540
to,
you know,
be up front with you.
Like,
okay,
that's,

863
00:54:40.380 --> 00:54:44.820
that's cool to see because I've been working with this guy for a while and I

864
00:54:44.821 --> 00:54:48.600
remember one mission,
we were doing downing in Kandahar,

865
00:54:49.230 --> 00:54:52.700
they,
we ended up getting infilled and we start looking at our,

866
00:54:52.910 --> 00:54:55.780
our Georgi the grid reverence or they,
you know,

867
00:54:55.860 --> 00:54:59.940
are a little map to see where we are and we're looking at it and it's 1:00 AM

868
00:54:59.941 --> 00:55:03.120
2:00 AM whatever it is.
I'm like,
I have no idea where we are.

869
00:55:03.150 --> 00:55:07.220
We're not on this map.
So,
um,

870
00:55:08.260 --> 00:55:12.900
well we hear some gunfire and we're like,
let's go that way.
You know.

871
00:55:13.830 --> 00:55:18.060
So,
so,
uh,
I have,
uh,
one of the interpreters with,

872
00:55:18.330 --> 00:55:23.330
with me went by blade because they all want to knock you about their real names

873
00:55:24.570 --> 00:55:29.010
in these situations,
but you know,
lay it and I'm like,
blade,
hey,
let's get this.

874
00:55:29.040 --> 00:55:31.860
Let's get the trip.
Let's here moving towards gunfire and see what happens.

875
00:55:32.020 --> 00:55:33.690
And then we start moving and we're doing our thing.

876
00:55:34.530 --> 00:55:39.270
And at one point I looked back and blades right there on my shoulder,

877
00:55:39.271 --> 00:55:42.810
he's doing his thing.
Yeah.
Like,
like where is everybody?

878
00:55:44.190 --> 00:55:49.080
And they had hunkered down,
I kind of a couple of terrain features back and like,

879
00:55:49.081 --> 00:55:53.940
well we got to go get him.
So,
but so you start there and then you know,

880
00:55:53.941 --> 00:55:58.520
over time that gap shortens a little bit to uh,

881
00:55:59.230 --> 00:56:02.570
you know,
ideally where they're leading.
Yeah.

882
00:56:02.700 --> 00:56:06.990
<v 2>What was the op tempo like?
How often would you guys go out and hit targets?</v>

883
00:56:07.800 --> 00:56:12.440
<v 3>Um,
it would vary time time,
but with that,</v>

884
00:56:13.760 --> 00:56:17.860
that training and advising piece,
we were,

885
00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:20.790
weren't going out like every night because like,

886
00:56:21.370 --> 00:56:23.120
we got to take these guys from,

887
00:56:23.130 --> 00:56:25.300
from ground up on mission planning and everything.

888
00:56:25.750 --> 00:56:29.020
So we're going out several times a month,
two a

889
00:56:30.520 --> 00:56:33.580
on bigger missions.
And then other little things as they came up

890
00:56:34.490 --> 00:56:37.850
<v 0>and when you,
so,
so it starts off,</v>

891
00:56:37.851 --> 00:56:39.890
these guys are not wanting to get anywhere.

892
00:56:40.010 --> 00:56:43.280
They're not wanting to get shot at there.
If there's rounds fired,

893
00:56:43.281 --> 00:56:44.990
they're hiding a couple terrain features away.

894
00:56:45.200 --> 00:56:48.680
And then you're slowly progressing them,
building a relationship with them,

895
00:56:48.681 --> 00:56:52.520
getting to know him,
the realize that they could actually do better.

896
00:56:52.880 --> 00:56:56.840
And that process is going on in you arrived,
this was in 2007.

897
00:56:56.841 --> 00:57:01.580
You guys are derived in October in 2007 is that right?
Uh,
yeah.
Okay.

898
00:57:02.510 --> 00:57:06.200
And then,
and then you're doing one,
two,
three missions,

899
00:57:06.290 --> 00:57:10.520
getting these guys trying to push him each time,
uh,
to,

900
00:57:10.540 --> 00:57:14.410
to do a little bit more,
to take on a little bit more responsibility.
And,

901
00:57:14.690 --> 00:57:17.070
and this is just sort of the way it is.
Well,

902
00:57:17.120 --> 00:57:19.820
and then what kind of training are you doing on top of that?
You're,

903
00:57:19.910 --> 00:57:23.450
when you're back on base,
you're running them through immediate action drills,

904
00:57:23.451 --> 00:57:25.130
you're teaching amount of shoot,
move and communicate.

905
00:57:25.131 --> 00:57:26.420
That's basically what's going on.
Yeah.

906
00:57:26.720 --> 00:57:30.230
<v 3>Teaching those,
those basic infantry skills,</v>

907
00:57:30.750 --> 00:57:33.040
I'm taking them out to the range,
teaching him how to clear buildings,

908
00:57:33.260 --> 00:57:35.240
teaching him,
you know,

909
00:57:35.960 --> 00:57:39.350
just all the things you need to continue to reinforce.
And then like I said,

910
00:57:39.351 --> 00:57:43.880
once you got a mission,
I go,
okay,
then we're gonna start going through those,

911
00:57:44.570 --> 00:57:46.400
those,
uh,
tape drills.

912
00:57:46.401 --> 00:57:50.750
And we're in build out a little village here as best we can with our,
our budget,

913
00:57:50.751 --> 00:57:52.170
which was,
you know,
tape

914
00:57:54.560 --> 00:57:58.060
and start building that stuff out.
So that way,
like,
okay,
we're going to it,

915
00:57:58.080 --> 00:58:01.340
fill here,
expect to walk this way,
started,
you know,
going into those,

916
00:58:01.341 --> 00:58:05.660
choreograph for hustles to get everybody,
get everybody ready.

917
00:58:05.990 --> 00:58:10.460
<v 0>So now as you guys got ready to go in the,
into the,
uh,
shock valley,</v>

918
00:58:11.120 --> 00:58:15.830
what was w did it seem like just another mission?
Did it seem like all this home,

919
00:58:15.831 --> 00:58:18.680
it seems like it's going to be a little bit heavier.
What was your,

920
00:58:18.740 --> 00:58:20.750
what was your assessment of it getting ready to do it?

921
00:58:22.430 --> 00:58:23.263
<v 3>Uh,</v>

922
00:58:25.400 --> 00:58:28.820
there were definitely a few

923
00:58:30.380 --> 00:58:35.180
red flags that came with this mission,
but there's red flags with,
with,

924
00:58:35.181 --> 00:58:39.890
with most missions,
like they give us a gun and,
and training for a reason.

925
00:58:39.891 --> 00:58:42.880
Like they don't ask you to go to tickle file with somebody that

926
00:58:44.960 --> 00:58:49.010
you're always expecting something.
Um,
but,
but uh,

927
00:58:50.000 --> 00:58:53.840
you know,
it was just,
it was,
you know,
we'd gone after high value targets before.

928
00:58:54.350 --> 00:58:59.330
Um,
we had intel,
he's over here.
We have Intel on what kind of,

929
00:58:59.331 --> 00:59:04.250
what to expect.
So
you know,
was

930
00:59:05.750 --> 00:59:09.920
our,
the plan that,
uh,
we end up going with.

931
00:59:10.010 --> 00:59:15.010
Nobody was super excited about the idea of infilling at the bottom of a mountain

932
00:59:15.891 --> 00:59:19.130
and then walk up that,
that does not sound fun,

933
00:59:21.890 --> 00:59:26.810
but it comes to the point where,
you know,
this is the mission.
Yup.
All right,
cool.

934
00:59:26.840 --> 00:59:29.300
We're going to do this mission the best we can and we're going to,

935
00:59:30.690 --> 00:59:32.730
<v 2>why did you guys have to answer it at the bottom of that hill?</v>

936
00:59:33.300 --> 00:59:36.970
<v 3>Uh,
I think the decision was made that,</v>

937
00:59:38.250 --> 00:59:40.950
you know,
the Afghan commander was still being a little bit new.
Like they,

938
00:59:40.960 --> 00:59:43.950
they knew how to fast rope.
Oh,
we had done that stuff,

939
00:59:43.980 --> 00:59:48.720
but how many people do we want to risk in during,

940
00:59:48.721 --> 00:59:53.670
on that,
on that,
and then just,
you know,
if there is resistance,

941
00:59:54.000 --> 00:59:57.630
you know,
what,
what's gonna,
what's gonna come of that?
And,
and

942
00:59:59.320 --> 01:00:02.970
I mean,
I try,
I try not to get too caught up in,

943
01:00:02.971 --> 01:00:06.810
well maybe it would have been better if we'd,
we didn't fill that in on top.

944
01:00:07.230 --> 01:00:09.490
Maybe would've caught an RPG to the 47

945
01:00:09.990 --> 01:00:12.890
<v 2>no,
no,
you can't play then.
You can't play that game.</v>

946
01:00:13.160 --> 01:00:17.330
I've played that game with myself and it's not a good game to play now.

947
01:00:17.390 --> 01:00:19.640
It doesn't mean that you don't look at it and you go,
Oh yeah,
okay,

948
01:00:19.670 --> 01:00:22.100
here's what we saw.
This is why we made the decision.

949
01:00:22.250 --> 01:00:25.930
This is something that you might brothers that are out there that could be in

950
01:00:25.931 --> 01:00:27.470
the same situation where you gotta make that decision.

951
01:00:27.680 --> 01:00:29.990
Considering how it worked out for me.
Right.

952
01:00:30.070 --> 01:00:33.250
<v 3>And,
and you know,
this is,</v>

953
01:00:34.030 --> 01:00:39.030
well a couple a couple weeks ago was an 11 year from that a battle.

954
01:00:39.611 --> 01:00:43.330
But I was actually talking to some SF guys not too long ago when they were like,

955
01:00:43.930 --> 01:00:47.260
we still talk about that mission.
We still talk about the,
the good,

956
01:00:47.261 --> 01:00:51.310
which was the teamwork,
the,
you know,
the everybody coming together,
get this,

957
01:00:51.520 --> 01:00:54.410
get this job done as best we could.
And we talk about the,

958
01:00:54.840 --> 01:00:56.410
the less ideal parts as well.

959
01:00:56.411 --> 01:01:01.411
And then make sure that we don't learn from somebody else's mistakes.

960
01:01:01.541 --> 01:01:02.800
Don't,
don't repeat those.

961
01:01:03.490 --> 01:01:07.480
And I think that's the great part about SF is you have that humbleness like,
hey,

962
01:01:07.840 --> 01:01:11.470
we did not do this right.
Please learn we did this right.
Please learn.

963
01:01:12.130 --> 01:01:15.430
<v 2>And,
and yeah,
and,
and again,
the other side of that is like,</v>

964
01:01:15.470 --> 01:01:17.590
you could look at this thing all day and say,
well,

965
01:01:17.650 --> 01:01:20.260
you should've gone and faster open on.
And like you said,

966
01:01:20.261 --> 01:01:24.040
you take an RPG and do one of those helicopters and there's nine dead guys or

967
01:01:24.041 --> 01:01:26.350
whatever and you go,
okay,
well I guess that wasn't a good plan.

968
01:01:26.570 --> 01:01:28.210
So you can make the best,

969
01:01:28.270 --> 01:01:31.300
you can make a horrible decision and it can work out well.

970
01:01:31.330 --> 01:01:35.190
You can make the best decision.
You can work out horribly.
So whether that,

971
01:01:35.191 --> 01:01:36.910
that's like a,
that's the way it is.

972
01:01:36.970 --> 01:01:41.020
So what you do is try and learn from it and look at what you did and say,
okay,

973
01:01:41.021 --> 01:01:42.430
well what could we have done better?

974
01:01:42.760 --> 01:01:46.900
Could you tell from the the imagery and,

975
01:01:46.901 --> 01:01:51.880
or the maps of the area,
what that terrain feature was like.

976
01:01:53.110 --> 01:01:56.550
Cause I'll tell you what I was,
you know,
I was in,

977
01:01:56.551 --> 01:01:57.880
in getting ready for this podcast,

978
01:01:57.881 --> 01:02:02.881
I read a bunch about the operation and I kept reading steep terrain and you

979
01:02:03.551 --> 01:02:06.100
know,
this,
that and the other thing.
And then,

980
01:02:06.250 --> 01:02:07.990
and I kind of calculate it in my mind,
you know,

981
01:02:07.991 --> 01:02:11.590
what that looked like in my mind and in my mind it was,
it was pretty bad.

982
01:02:11.591 --> 01:02:13.330
It was like okay,
must've been pretty challenging.

983
01:02:13.990 --> 01:02:18.580
Then I went and looked at actual footage cause there's a bunch of actual footage

984
01:02:18.581 --> 01:02:21.480
because you guys a combat photographer and you had a bunch of overhead cover.

985
01:02:22.200 --> 01:02:25.340
I saw that terrain rather,

986
01:02:25.740 --> 01:02:30.450
I could not believe it.
I was,
I was,
I was saying,
oh my Mike,

987
01:02:30.480 --> 01:02:32.040
like as bad as everything sounded,

988
01:02:32.070 --> 01:02:34.980
it was 10 times worse when I saw that Terena I was like,

989
01:02:34.981 --> 01:02:39.110
I can't believe that this,
that these guys did this.
Uh,
I agree.
Yeah.

990
01:02:39.210 --> 01:02:41.310
And I don't just mean that from,
I can't believe you inserted there.

991
01:02:41.340 --> 01:02:44.520
I was saying with the fact that you guys went up there that everything that you

992
01:02:44.521 --> 01:02:47.970
had to do on that operation because the terrain was so steep,

993
01:02:48.210 --> 01:02:52.020
I couldn't believe that you guys got out of there.
I mean it was just crazy.

994
01:02:52.500 --> 01:02:55.200
<v 3>Like,
you know what I mean?
You get used to,</v>

995
01:02:55.440 --> 01:02:59.730
you see the Predator imagery beforehand to kind of get a feel.

996
01:02:59.731 --> 01:03:04.340
You've seen satellite imagery and get used to saying that stuff and you kind of,

997
01:03:05.400 --> 01:03:08.220
you learn to build in that variance of this is what it looks like there,

998
01:03:08.221 --> 01:03:11.550
but I know it's not going to be like that.
And so you Kinda,

999
01:03:11.910 --> 01:03:13.800
you build in your right and your left limit.
It's like,

1000
01:03:14.340 --> 01:03:16.800
this is kind of what I think I'm going to see.
Yeah.

1001
01:03:17.090 --> 01:03:20.960
And it was still a little bit more than that,
at least for me.
Right.

1002
01:03:21.020 --> 01:03:26.000
<v 2>What I was expecting.
Yeah.
It was no joke.
It's,
it's a borderline cliff.</v>

1003
01:03:26.060 --> 01:03:28.280
I mean it is steep.
And anyone that's listening to this,

1004
01:03:28.281 --> 01:03:33.281
and you can go on youtube and you can Google battle of shock valley and you'll,

1005
01:03:33.861 --> 01:03:37.730
you'll start see what,
what I'm talking about.
It's,
it's,
it's some heavy,

1006
01:03:37.820 --> 01:03:42.140
steep terrain with a damn fortress on the top of it.

1007
01:03:42.560 --> 01:03:47.120
I couldn't believe that either.
I was like all of that.
That is a fortress.

1008
01:03:47.180 --> 01:03:49.340
How many Afghan commandos did you have with you?

1009
01:03:49.790 --> 01:03:53.750
<v 3>We can start it with right around a hundred of them.
And then,
so my team,</v>

1010
01:03:54.140 --> 01:03:57.420
you know,
so I go through it in my head,

1011
01:03:57.421 --> 01:04:01.490
I was about 12 dudes when you,
when you add it all up,

1012
01:04:01.550 --> 01:04:05.870
we had about a hundred commandos and then we,
we had,
uh,

1013
01:04:06.140 --> 01:04:09.980
another SF team that was kind of further down in the valley trying to act as a

1014
01:04:10.490 --> 01:04:13.670
blocking position in down there and,
and so,

1015
01:04:13.850 --> 01:04:17.630
but our main assault force,
um,

1016
01:04:19.640 --> 01:04:24.060
I mean,
yeah,
it was about 12 dudes that kind of where that,

1017
01:04:24.090 --> 01:04:26.270
that main assaults.
Yeah.
All right.

1018
01:04:26.890 --> 01:04:30.310
<v 2>So,
so you guys,
you,
you look at the plan,
everyone's Kinda like,
hey,</v>

1019
01:04:30.311 --> 01:04:32.770
it's going to be steep.
It's going to be tough.
This is what we do.

1020
01:04:32.890 --> 01:04:33.940
Let's go get some,

1021
01:04:34.130 --> 01:04:37.700
<v 3>yeah.
I mean,
we made,
we made some,
uh,</v>

1022
01:04:39.240 --> 01:04:44.090
like accommodations for that.
Like,
given what we're doing today,

1023
01:04:44.600 --> 01:04:48.380
obviously you always want your secondary,
but you know if,

1024
01:04:48.620 --> 01:04:51.020
if that Beretta doesn't walk up the hill with you today,

1025
01:04:51.130 --> 01:04:54.020
like we understand we got it.
We got to cut some weight.

1026
01:04:54.170 --> 01:04:58.140
[inaudible] yourselves down a little bit.
We did pare down,
um,

1027
01:04:58.300 --> 01:04:59.640
what body armor I,

1028
01:04:59.641 --> 01:05:03.890
we still went with with the plate stolen with still with the helmets.
Um,

1029
01:05:04.130 --> 01:05:08.020
and when you're doing those pre combat checks with your,
your,

1030
01:05:08.030 --> 01:05:08.990
your effing commandos,

1031
01:05:08.991 --> 01:05:13.991
that was always the fun part is they're super motivated to be there.

1032
01:05:16.161 --> 01:05:17.780
And I remember one time where

1033
01:05:18.330 --> 01:05:21.310
<v 4>we going and do the pre combat checks with a to 40 gunner.</v>

1034
01:05:21.311 --> 01:05:25.900
So he's got a belt fed machine gun.
You carry this,
this is your job.

1035
01:05:26.380 --> 01:05:29.860
I started going through and I find,
you know,
the first m four mag on him.
Like,

1036
01:05:30.270 --> 01:05:33.670
all right dude.
I mean you don't carry it.
I'm for it.
But I get it.

1037
01:05:33.671 --> 01:05:34.810
And we ended up finding,

1038
01:05:34.811 --> 01:05:39.490
I think eight or nine informed mags on this dude like Carrie,

1039
01:05:39.520 --> 01:05:44.320
Carrie more seven,
six two for the belt fed.
Like,
I appreciate the,
you know,

1040
01:05:44.321 --> 01:05:48.130
you want to want to be ready,
but focus,

1041
01:05:48.520 --> 01:05:50.050
focus in where I need you buddy.

1042
01:05:51.400 --> 01:05:55.210
<v 5>That's Kinda crazy.
So,
so you guys,
uh,
so how many,</v>

1043
01:05:55.750 --> 01:05:58.060
how many helicopters was it that was bringing you all in there?

1044
01:05:58.090 --> 01:06:02.680
It must've been a big package.
And did you go in all at once?
Like one giant lift?

1045
01:06:02.860 --> 01:06:07.460
<v 4>It was,
it was,
yeah,
one lift I day.
It was a couple,</v>

1046
01:06:07.620 --> 01:06:12.450
couple of Chinooks,
couple black ox,
um,
everybody going in.
And then,

1047
01:06:13.530 --> 01:06:14.490
uh,
like I said,

1048
01:06:14.491 --> 01:06:18.180
there was another team that Kinda infilled down there with a smaller commando

1049
01:06:18.181 --> 01:06:23.030
package.
Um,
and uh,
we had,
you know,

1050
01:06:23.040 --> 01:06:27.840
some medical QRF and stuff up in the air if you other things,

1051
01:06:27.870 --> 01:06:28.650
you know.

1052
01:06:28.650 --> 01:06:33.420
So we definitely had what seems like enough going in.

1053
01:06:34.650 --> 01:06:39.540
<v 5>So you land in there and how long does it take before you realized like,
wow,</v>

1054
01:06:39.541 --> 01:06:42.540
okay,
this is,
this is,
we took a big bite.
Yeah.

1055
01:06:42.950 --> 01:06:46.820
<v 4>Well I'll,
I'll,
uh,
highlight.</v>

1056
01:06:46.821 --> 01:06:50.320
So I was the first guy I get on the Chinook saw that,

1057
01:06:50.321 --> 01:06:53.640
that when the last guy to get off,
you know,
you know,

1058
01:06:55.190 --> 01:06:57.950
just having that responsibility to make sure everybody gets off,
gets up safely.

1059
01:06:58.540 --> 01:07:01.950
Um,
and so we hit the zone,

1060
01:07:01.960 --> 01:07:06.440
we hear the go and everybody's getting off helicopter.

1061
01:07:06.890 --> 01:07:11.510
So incredibly slowly and,
and I'm at the front,
so I'm in the back of the line.

1062
01:07:11.511 --> 01:07:14.780
I don't know what's going on.
I'm just yelling at commandos,
like,

1063
01:07:15.200 --> 01:07:18.320
get off of this helicopter now.

1064
01:07:18.321 --> 01:07:21.880
Like the more time we're sitting here in the morning,
yeah.
If,

1065
01:07:21.920 --> 01:07:25.730
if there was a bad guy watching us,
we're just giving him more time to watch us.

1066
01:07:26.710 --> 01:07:29.270
Uh,
so it was just taking forever.

1067
01:07:29.900 --> 01:07:34.670
And I finally get to the back of the Chinook and I look out and I'm like,
oh,

1068
01:07:34.671 --> 01:07:38.110
we're like 15 feet off the ground.
The,
the,

1069
01:07:38.350 --> 01:07:42.860
the valley that we're in is just so rocky and so,
such horrible terrain.

1070
01:07:42.861 --> 01:07:46.280
Even they're like,
they didn't land like,
oh,
okay,

1071
01:07:46.281 --> 01:07:49.760
this is why it's taken so long.
So like everybody else in front of me,

1072
01:07:49.761 --> 01:07:53.420
I very carefully,
you know,
sit down and try and ship me off the backs.

1073
01:07:53.421 --> 01:07:56.360
I'm not breaking a leg before I even start.

1074
01:07:56.430 --> 01:08:01.220
I'm off to a good start.
Yeah.
It started strong.
So,

1075
01:08:02.210 --> 01:08:03.980
so we,
we get off the,

1076
01:08:04.010 --> 01:08:09.010
the Schnucks fly away and then you just kind of get that rolling that cold quiet

1077
01:08:12.200 --> 01:08:17.060
of an Afghan,
uh,
valley.
Um,
you know,

1078
01:08:17.061 --> 01:08:21.370
there's that little bit of ice in the,
in the water there,
you know,
it's just,

1079
01:08:21.371 --> 01:08:22.204
yeah.

1080
01:08:22.350 --> 01:08:23.183
<v 6>Okay.</v>

1081
01:08:23.880 --> 01:08:26.280
<v 4>You know what you want to use the cliche,
like it's too quiet,</v>

1082
01:08:26.950 --> 01:08:30.030
but we do use it the house,
but,

1083
01:08:31.770 --> 01:08:33.680
but yeah,
we just got,
we get out there.

1084
01:08:33.720 --> 01:08:37.650
How far did you have to patrol up the valley before you were,
you know,

1085
01:08:37.651 --> 01:08:41.110
perpendicular to the target building?
Um,

1086
01:08:41.160 --> 01:08:45.060
where the target castle because that's what it looks like.
Okay.
I mean it,

1087
01:08:45.270 --> 01:08:48.390
you know,
in hindsight and then,
you know,
you're seeing up there like,
I mean,

1088
01:08:48.560 --> 01:08:51.930
they had fixed fighting positions ready to go for sure.
They were,

1089
01:08:52.050 --> 01:08:56.340
it looked like a castle.
They were,
they were set.
Um,
I would guess,

1090
01:08:58.920 --> 01:08:59.753
<v 6>right.</v>

1091
01:09:01.280 --> 01:09:02.560
<v 4>400 meters,</v>

1092
01:09:02.570 --> 01:09:07.570
600 somewhere and that we got basically we infill just basically trying to use

1093
01:09:09.021 --> 01:09:12.170
angles just to make sure,
like we're not that far away.

1094
01:09:12.560 --> 01:09:14.840
So if we have some element of surprise,

1095
01:09:14.841 --> 01:09:18.950
we don't waste it all but not so close that,

1096
01:09:19.950 --> 01:09:23.450
you know,
we're already in it before we get off.
Is that,
yeah,

1097
01:09:23.451 --> 01:09:25.780
it wasn't that far.
Uh,

1098
01:09:26.030 --> 01:09:29.930
so you weren't on the ground very long before you started.
Did you start,

1099
01:09:29.960 --> 01:09:34.270
you took fire from these guys from the castle?
Yeah,
I couldn't,

1100
01:09:34.550 --> 01:09:37.620
I couldn't tell you how long before the castle started shooting at us.
Uh,

1101
01:09:37.640 --> 01:09:42.560
it could have been five,
10,
15 minutes.
I don't think it was that long.
Uh,

1102
01:09:43.040 --> 01:09:44.420
so I was in the other,

1103
01:09:44.610 --> 01:09:49.610
the trailing element basically because I was the only us medic on the ground

1104
01:09:50.630 --> 01:09:54.980
there.
I had my African commando medics.
But yeah,
I was the only,

1105
01:09:55.550 --> 01:09:58.940
only a team medic.
There are,
you know,

1106
01:09:58.941 --> 01:10:02.900
SF that you were supposed to have to have this job to have that job to the next.

1107
01:10:03.270 --> 01:10:07.970
Uh,
fortunately the,
the other medic on the team had been hurt.
Um,

1108
01:10:08.210 --> 01:10:12.620
on a previous mission.
And then while he was recovering from that,

1109
01:10:12.621 --> 01:10:17.150
he was in a vehicle rollover,
which didn't help.
Um,
so he got pulled out.

1110
01:10:17.450 --> 01:10:22.280
So,
yeah.
All right.
Well,
uh,

1111
01:10:22.340 --> 01:10:27.020
hostile do it.
So
yeah,
there's 10,

1112
01:10:27.021 --> 01:10:31.490
15 minutes maybe at most,
oh,
we start walking,
walking up there,

1113
01:10:31.491 --> 01:10:33.800
you can see the,
the,

1114
01:10:33.801 --> 01:10:38.801
the bleed assault for starting to work their way up and,

1115
01:10:39.870 --> 01:10:40.440
<v 6>okay.</v>

1116
01:10:40.440 --> 01:10:44.970
<v 4>Yeah.
Everywhere.
It's super steep.
I'm on both your left and right as you're,</v>

1117
01:10:45.060 --> 01:10:50.060
as you're kind of looking at it and they find one little area where you have

1118
01:10:50.701 --> 01:10:51.600
those kinds of terrorists,

1119
01:10:51.601 --> 01:10:55.140
like farm terrorists has kind of working up and that's where they'd figure it

1120
01:10:55.141 --> 01:10:57.570
out.
Okay.
What we're going to work our way up there.

1121
01:10:57.900 --> 01:11:02.820
And so you can see them starting to make progress up the up the mountain.

1122
01:11:02.910 --> 01:11:07.910
And then ned distinctly remember I saw one dude,

1123
01:11:08.771 --> 01:11:13.080
Justin blue,
blue,
uh,
African garb,

1124
01:11:14.010 --> 01:11:18.600
sprint across the top of the hill with a,
with a rifle.
And I don't,
I mean,

1125
01:11:18.601 --> 01:11:20.190
I don't think he's the dude who started shooting at us,

1126
01:11:20.191 --> 01:11:25.191
but I saw that and then within a few seconds everything just kinda opened up on

1127
01:11:26.251 --> 01:11:29.960
us.
And
Yeah,

1128
01:11:30.540 --> 01:11:33.960
<v 5>they started,
uh,
uh,</v>

1129
01:11:34.650 --> 01:11:38.100
one of my little sayings is always take the high ground or we'll take you,

1130
01:11:38.220 --> 01:11:40.020
and this was just a situation where you guys,

1131
01:11:40.021 --> 01:11:42.300
do you guys do not have the high ground at all?

1132
01:11:42.630 --> 01:11:44.190
You guys are literally in a valley.

1133
01:11:44.550 --> 01:11:46.980
How long was it before you took your first wounded?

1134
01:11:47.910 --> 01:11:51.340
<v 4>Uh,
it was pretty quick.
Uh,</v>

1135
01:11:52.390 --> 01:11:57.160
so we start taking the,
the fire,
I,
my first job is,
is to my squad.

1136
01:11:57.620 --> 01:12:00.820
I Pan commando squad.
So I started getting them situated.

1137
01:12:00.821 --> 01:12:05.350
There's not much cover in there.
It's just smaller rocks,
big rocks.

1138
01:12:05.890 --> 01:12:09.500
Um,
what would that elevation and uh,

1139
01:12:10.450 --> 01:12:14.690
at various points,
I mean both sides were kind of shooting at us.
Uh,

1140
01:12:15.910 --> 01:12:19.600
so I start getting them situated and then very quickly,
a haired,

1141
01:12:19.660 --> 01:12:24.130
the first call for a medic,
one of the Afghan commandos had been shot.

1142
01:12:24.690 --> 01:12:29.410
Um,
luckily it was a fairly minor wound so I ran over to him,

1143
01:12:29.411 --> 01:12:34.411
started treating him and while I was working on him just assessing the

1144
01:12:35.111 --> 01:12:35.950
situation.

1145
01:12:36.670 --> 01:12:41.670
That's when I remember watching many RPGs coming down.

1146
01:12:42.520 --> 01:12:45.790
But uh,
what RPG in particular come down,

1147
01:12:45.791 --> 01:12:50.500
hit right in front of our lines that the guys were starting to form down in the,

1148
01:12:51.340 --> 01:12:54.250
in the,
in the valley.

1149
01:12:54.490 --> 01:12:58.180
And then I hear the calls for Ron coming down.

1150
01:12:58.390 --> 01:13:03.390
And so I know right away like right Wallen had just been hurt.

1151
01:13:06.251 --> 01:13:10.360
Like I just know that right away because before every mission Brian would come

1152
01:13:11.470 --> 01:13:16.470
take his squad of the day and stand in front of me and hold them and be like,

1153
01:13:17.290 --> 01:13:19.120
this is wrong.
If something happens to me,

1154
01:13:19.240 --> 01:13:24.040
find wrong and then you get the next one,
this is wrong.
Something happens.

1155
01:13:27.080 --> 01:13:31.030
And so they would,
you know when,
when,
or not calling for a medic there,

1156
01:13:31.031 --> 01:13:35.230
just calling for Ron.
I okay.
I know he's squad.
That is.

1157
01:13:36.040 --> 01:13:40.690
So
yeah,
it Kinda did that quick math like okay,

1158
01:13:40.691 --> 01:13:44.950
this guy,
he's fine.
He's,
he's really not going to live or die based on anything.

1159
01:13:44.951 --> 01:13:49.120
I do suck it up.
Grad,
he had a solid grab yourself,
start shooting back,

1160
01:13:50.530 --> 01:13:55.140
good luck and ran over towards uh,
were,

1161
01:13:55.141 --> 01:13:57.550
had that,
that next call.

1162
01:13:58.750 --> 01:14:02.390
And like you had read earlier,
I Find Ryan,
uh,

1163
01:14:03.130 --> 01:14:06.460
pleading pretty,
I'm pretty profusely from neck.

1164
01:14:06.461 --> 01:14:11.461
And of course now you got a neck injury and you got to go through those quick

1165
01:14:13.331 --> 01:14:16.500
calculations.
Like normally how do you stop bleeding?
Lots of pressure.

1166
01:14:16.501 --> 01:14:20.560
And I'm like,
well I can't choke them to death,
no tourniquets going to work out.

1167
01:14:22.840 --> 01:14:24.340
So yeah,

1168
01:14:24.350 --> 01:14:27.980
just that's kind of started the my day of improvising,

1169
01:14:28.030 --> 01:14:29.350
like trying to figure out how to,

1170
01:14:29.720 --> 01:14:33.880
how to get pressure and I don't even remember exactly what I did.
Yeah,

1171
01:14:34.080 --> 01:14:35.580
you just caught caught shrapnel.

1172
01:14:35.660 --> 01:14:39.580
I had several shrapnel wounds and the in there,

1173
01:14:39.581 --> 01:14:41.080
but you know,

1174
01:14:41.081 --> 01:14:43.990
you just doing those quick quick assessments or where there no bubbling,

1175
01:14:44.020 --> 01:14:47.380
which means pride in hit airway,
you know,
it's,

1176
01:14:47.610 --> 01:14:51.530
it's bleeding a lot but not bleeding that fast that I,

1177
01:14:51.531 --> 01:14:55.960
I think it caught a carotid or something like that.
So it was pretty lucky.

1178
01:14:55.961 --> 01:14:59.560
Neck wound.
Yeah.
If you have to catch them shrapnel to the neck.

1179
01:14:59.561 --> 01:15:03.660
He did it pretty well.
Um,
uh,

1180
01:15:04.690 --> 01:15:06.850
so yeah.
Why as I was working on him,

1181
01:15:06.851 --> 01:15:11.290
everybody's trying to just figure out what's,
what's going

1182
01:15:11.470 --> 01:15:16.340
<v 5>on the mindsets to we're still assaulting this thing.
Oh yeah.
Dang.
Oh wait,</v>

1183
01:15:16.430 --> 01:15:21.050
we didn't just Trump to me in a mental attitude cause I would have been,
oh,

1184
01:15:21.051 --> 01:15:23.110
we just got launched by the way you use that.

1185
01:15:23.120 --> 01:15:26.180
You said we get low launched many RPGs.

1186
01:15:26.630 --> 01:15:30.570
When I get launched many RPGs at me from an elevated position to offer on the

1187
01:15:30.580 --> 01:15:34.570
salt in that target.
We're going somewhere else and I got a wounded guy.

1188
01:15:34.580 --> 01:15:36.320
Got Two wounded people.
Yeah.
We're,
we're not,

1189
01:15:36.321 --> 01:15:37.790
we're not going any further up this hill.

1190
01:15:38.600 --> 01:15:41.310
<v 4>We're shooting RPGs back at him.
We had I on,</v>

1191
01:15:41.390 --> 01:15:45.890
I legitimately could not tell you our African commandos real name,

1192
01:15:45.891 --> 01:15:50.750
but he just,
he knew his name was Joe Pesci.
Uh,
that's,
that's what we called him.

1193
01:15:51.200 --> 01:15:55.670
He looked like Joe Pesci.
He was,
he was our Afghan commando RPG guy.

1194
01:15:56.090 --> 01:15:58.760
And so he was kind of like looking at all of us and looking at the mountain and

1195
01:15:58.761 --> 01:16:02.550
pointing up there and pointing it as RPG and like,
hell yeah,
dude,

1196
01:16:03.970 --> 01:16:06.900
<v 5>Joe,
make it happen.
And so yeah,</v>

1197
01:16:07.300 --> 01:16:08.980
let's see some good fellas right here.

1198
01:16:09.230 --> 01:16:12.800
<v 4>Yeah.
So Jo Beth,
she started shooting back,</v>

1199
01:16:13.010 --> 01:16:17.210
so we start getting given back as good as,
as,
as uh,
they were.

1200
01:16:18.460 --> 01:16:22.880
Um,
but so yeah,
all that's Kinda starting to go on.
Uh,

1201
01:16:24.230 --> 01:16:28.500
you know,
working with Ryan,
trying to figure out what am I,

1202
01:16:28.610 --> 01:16:31.070
you go back and get my squad,
what needs to happen.

1203
01:16:31.700 --> 01:16:34.610
And that's what I hear on the radio.
The call from,

1204
01:16:35.150 --> 01:16:38.880
from up on the mountain that multiple guys,
uh,

1205
01:16:39.920 --> 01:16:43.640
we're now now wounded.
I'm

1206
01:16:45.860 --> 01:16:47.600
pretty sure the call was that.
And you know,

1207
01:16:47.601 --> 01:16:51.410
the three guys at that point or when did so,
yeah,

1208
01:16:51.740 --> 01:16:55.280
basically told Ryan,
you're good.
Have a nice day.

1209
01:16:55.940 --> 01:16:58.040
And grabbed my stuff.

1210
01:16:58.790 --> 01:17:03.250
Just started working towards the mountain.
Um,
uh,

1211
01:17:03.340 --> 01:17:07.130
our team team,
Sergeant Scott Ford,
and,
uh,

1212
01:17:07.850 --> 01:17:10.040
one of the weapons,
Matt Williams,

1213
01:17:10.041 --> 01:17:15.041
they started organizing a response force to,

1214
01:17:16.610 --> 01:17:19.490
to get up there and start flexing a little more muscle up on the hill.

1215
01:17:19.880 --> 01:17:23.390
So they're,
they're organizing that.
My focus is,
hey,

1216
01:17:24.560 --> 01:17:29.120
I need to go.
So,
you know,
we hit the mountains,
start working,

1217
01:17:29.180 --> 01:17:32.750
sticking my way,
way up the same terrorist,
uh,

1218
01:17:32.751 --> 01:17:36.950
features that I talked about before and,
you know,
it is climbing handover,

1219
01:17:37.280 --> 01:17:40.970
you know,
hand over hand,
you're literally climbing,
get up to the next terrorist,

1220
01:17:42.140 --> 01:17:44.840
figure out how much are we being shot at right now,
where's it coming from?

1221
01:17:44.841 --> 01:17:48.950
Where's the next place I can go up and just start working our way up.

1222
01:17:49.660 --> 01:17:51.350
Uh,
as,
as we went up,
you know,
the,

1223
01:17:51.680 --> 01:17:54.800
the other support element kind of got got with me and we all just started taking

1224
01:17:54.801 --> 01:17:57.080
that terrain together.

1225
01:17:58.550 --> 01:17:59.383
<v 6>Hmm.</v>

1226
01:18:01.370 --> 01:18:04.140
<v 4>Took a,
took a while to get there.
I Dunno.
I Dunno.</v>

1227
01:18:04.300 --> 01:18:08.240
They put out their estimates with,
I don't know how long it took me to get there.

1228
01:18:08.930 --> 01:18:10.250
Uh,
got up to the,

1229
01:18:11.270 --> 01:18:15.050
the little outcropping that had become,

1230
01:18:16.340 --> 01:18:20.580
you know,
where the,
where the,
where the command element was.
Well,

1231
01:18:20.930 --> 01:18:25.490
it was,
and
start processing the situation that we had.

1232
01:18:26.390 --> 01:18:31.260
Uh,
right as I,
right as I'm looking at it,
I can see,
uh,

1233
01:18:31.450 --> 01:18:32.610
one of our interpreters,

1234
01:18:32.780 --> 01:18:37.200
c k he appears to be gay.
Um,

1235
01:18:37.650 --> 01:18:42.330
two of the two of the team guys,
we're down with the

1236
01:18:44.720 --> 01:18:45.780
different wounds.

1237
01:18:45.781 --> 01:18:50.280
And so I started just trying to go through the fastest yeah.

1238
01:18:50.420 --> 01:18:53.670
Triage that I can to figure out what I need to do.
And,

1239
01:18:55.290 --> 01:18:56.640
and mean,
honestly,

1240
01:18:56.641 --> 01:19:00.540
even at this point where I don't think the calls may quite yet that we're,

1241
01:19:00.570 --> 01:19:01.920
we're done for the day,
but it was going to be,

1242
01:19:01.921 --> 01:19:05.700
it was going to be called very soon after that.
Um,

1243
01:19:08.220 --> 01:19:10.050
so yeah,

1244
01:19:10.051 --> 01:19:13.590
trying to remember the f the full sequence.

1245
01:19:13.970 --> 01:19:16.370
It was a busy day.
Um,

1246
01:19:17.190 --> 01:19:21.540
so I think I started working on Dylan first just because he looked the worst

1247
01:19:21.990 --> 01:19:22.381
off.

1248
01:19:22.381 --> 01:19:27.381
He had a gunshot wound to his right arm and then another one to his hip pelvis

1249
01:19:29.640 --> 01:19:33.590
area,
his,
his armor.

1250
01:19:33.591 --> 01:19:36.360
And I joke with him now because he's good,
he's fine.

1251
01:19:36.361 --> 01:19:39.480
And it's okay to joke about getting shot after the fact.

1252
01:19:40.830 --> 01:19:44.370
But you know,
joke with them that,
you know,
that w at one board,
the hit his arm,

1253
01:19:44.940 --> 01:19:48.930
uh,
it was,
it was just a,
uh,
lucky bullet for him,

1254
01:19:49.500 --> 01:19:53.160
but it went through his,
his um,

1255
01:19:55.920 --> 01:20:00.660
ah,
forgive me,
just speaking words is tough sometimes is a raise,
a rifle,
a strap.

1256
01:20:00.690 --> 01:20:01.850
It went okay.
Sling,

1257
01:20:01.950 --> 01:20:06.950
they went through a slang cut cut that then went through his arm and then he

1258
01:20:08.640 --> 01:20:09.900
chose to keep his pistol on that day.

1259
01:20:09.901 --> 01:20:13.450
But at the time we were still kind of running a pistol on the front of your,

1260
01:20:13.451 --> 01:20:14.420
your body armor.
Yup.

1261
01:20:14.640 --> 01:20:19.640
And so it had actually lodged in between his plate and his,

1262
01:20:20.270 --> 01:20:23.520
his pistol.
He hit the inside of his,

1263
01:20:24.210 --> 01:20:28.650
his pistol or that,
just a slightly different angles on that bullet and yeah.

1264
01:20:29.730 --> 01:20:31.200
Yeah.
So his,

1265
01:20:31.290 --> 01:20:35.610
his arm wound was basically just a very minor bleed.

1266
01:20:35.611 --> 01:20:38.230
Didn't worry too much about that,
uh,

1267
01:20:39.180 --> 01:20:43.180
but didn't take me long to figure out is,
is his other one was going to,

1268
01:20:43.950 --> 01:20:48.450
going to be
literally a pain in the ass for him all day,

1269
01:20:48.920 --> 01:20:52.430
uh,
figure it to the League for me.
Uh,

1270
01:20:53.640 --> 01:20:55.110
but it was,
you know,

1271
01:20:55.111 --> 01:20:59.550
you could just see the way it's bleeding and it's just,
you know,

1272
01:20:59.551 --> 01:21:04.390
those very small wounds entry.
Um,

1273
01:21:05.010 --> 01:21:08.740
so I made the,
I made the,

1274
01:21:09.210 --> 01:21:13.830
I would say dunk call for just a few moments.
I don't even know how long it was.

1275
01:21:14.400 --> 01:21:17.340
Uh,
I didn't want to roll him anymore than I had to,

1276
01:21:17.910 --> 01:21:21.750
to just see what was going on.
Uh,

1277
01:21:21.960 --> 01:21:24.390
so I for a little bit,
took my home on,
off,

1278
01:21:24.540 --> 01:21:29.540
set it to the side so I could just roll him just to see the downside wound.

1279
01:21:29.610 --> 01:21:34.020
How bad was it?
Uh,
didn't end up being that bad,

1280
01:21:34.770 --> 01:21:38.580
so we're going to roll them back over and helped me up on my helmet on right

1281
01:21:38.581 --> 01:21:41.460
away.
Or maybe somebody yelled at me.
Uh,

1282
01:21:42.570 --> 01:21:47.160
but so just started working on trying to figure out how to get pressure on
there.

1283
01:21:47.460 --> 01:21:52.200
You'd mentioned we had the WHO combat camera man out there with us,
uh,

1284
01:21:52.710 --> 01:21:57.140
by that point is Cameron already been shot.
So he,

1285
01:21:57.660 --> 01:21:59.520
he just became an extra,

1286
01:21:59.790 --> 01:22:04.420
an extra set of hands for me to,
to help.
So I'm like,

1287
01:22:04.440 --> 01:22:07.650
okay,
let me go with triage the rest of these guys real quick,

1288
01:22:08.070 --> 01:22:11.640
just hold pressure here for me.
I'll be back in a second and

1289
01:22:13.320 --> 01:22:17.880
now I say I'll be back like the area we're working in,
which was not

1290
01:22:19.500 --> 01:22:20.430
that big,
it was

1291
01:22:22.560 --> 01:22:27.560
maybe 20 meters across and it's just that that slight slope you get on a

1292
01:22:28.471 --> 01:22:32.270
hillside before it falls off the cliff so to speak.
Like,

1293
01:22:32.410 --> 01:22:37.050
and everybody's just talked up in the hanging on that tiny little bit of a slope

1294
01:22:37.380 --> 01:22:39.660
trying to not fall off and not get shot.

1295
01:22:40.070 --> 01:22:40.990
<v 5>And the,</v>

1296
01:22:41.020 --> 01:22:44.390
the guys had been shot with a on that soap and they got shot with a pushing up a

1297
01:22:44.391 --> 01:22:45.560
little bit.
Will you,

1298
01:22:45.561 --> 01:22:50.240
will you somewhat safe in that shot where you're in that spot where you somewhat

1299
01:22:50.241 --> 01:22:52.670
protector was guys don't get,
I guess they weren't cause you,

1300
01:22:52.820 --> 01:22:54.110
you still guys were getting shot

1301
01:22:54.470 --> 01:22:57.920
<v 4>guys.
We're still rolling,
still getting shot the whole time.
Uh,</v>

1302
01:22:58.640 --> 01:23:00.770
so we're,
we're basically,

1303
01:23:00.771 --> 01:23:04.580
you're just trying to use that tiny bit of an angle to minimize how much you can

1304
01:23:04.581 --> 01:23:05.590
be shot.
There was,

1305
01:23:06.880 --> 01:23:11.470
there was no place where you were safe on there at all.

1306
01:23:12.130 --> 01:23:14.710
Um,
if you kind of

1307
01:23:16.300 --> 01:23:20.800
picture like from from,
from that little outcropping where we were,

1308
01:23:21.840 --> 01:23:25.120
if you're looking at the main village,
it was almost like a,

1309
01:23:26.230 --> 01:23:30.880
like a hockey stick kind of in front of you is the way the mountain kind of

1310
01:23:30.881 --> 01:23:32.680
wrapped around.
So yeah,

1311
01:23:32.681 --> 01:23:36.400
that long wall kind of on what I'm considering my left,

1312
01:23:36.760 --> 01:23:40.240
but then it still wrapped around,
so the whole village,

1313
01:23:41.520 --> 01:23:43.870
if you've got a little bit of cover from this side,

1314
01:23:43.900 --> 01:23:46.120
you're exposed to the other side.
The other side still had you.

1315
01:23:46.121 --> 01:23:48.190
And then there was some people on the other side of the,

1316
01:23:48.640 --> 01:23:50.770
the valley who were shooting this too,
but it was much,

1317
01:23:51.550 --> 01:23:54.460
it was insignificant compared to other problems we had.

1318
01:23:55.500 --> 01:23:59.490
<v 2>Was your mindset at this point totally focused on just getting the Gore get</v>

1319
01:23:59.491 --> 01:24:02.550
working on the guys.
Did you go into that mode?
Like of,
okay,

1320
01:24:02.880 --> 01:24:06.910
this is what I got to do,
or wars,
any part of you going,
ah,

1321
01:24:06.930 --> 01:24:10.890
this is not good.
D did any,
was there any party that was saying,
hold on a second,

1322
01:24:10.891 --> 01:24:13.820
look what's happening.
Situationally were surrounded,
they have the,

1323
01:24:13.920 --> 01:24:16.500
the enemy has the upper ground.
I got won't three wounded guys.

1324
01:24:16.890 --> 01:24:19.230
What calls being made?
What,
what was,

1325
01:24:19.290 --> 01:24:22.560
what was like your tactical assessment of what was happening?

1326
01:24:23.910 --> 01:24:24.743
<v 4>Uh,</v>

1327
01:24:25.350 --> 01:24:28.830
<v 2>or were you just straight up a working on guys trying to save their lives?</v>

1328
01:24:29.650 --> 01:24:34.570
<v 4>From my perspective,
it was straight up working on guys,
uh,
at that point,</v>

1329
01:24:34.600 --> 01:24:38.230
the trying to get my commandos and you know,

1330
01:24:38.380 --> 01:24:43.300
leading them anywhere that was over for me.
Um,
I would,

1331
01:24:43.301 --> 01:24:47.470
I would find them hours and hours later and they were like,

1332
01:24:47.530 --> 01:24:49.960
they were still down in the valley,
just hanging out,

1333
01:24:50.320 --> 01:24:51.670
trying to use a little bit of cover.

1334
01:24:51.671 --> 01:24:53.620
And they all kind of saw me and they're like,

1335
01:24:53.650 --> 01:24:58.230
we thought you were dead a while ago.
Welcome back.
Uh,

1336
01:24:58.910 --> 01:25:01.660
you're like,
thanks for the support.
Appreciate it.
Yeah,
thanks.

1337
01:25:01.661 --> 01:25:05.080
So I just said we were working on closing those gaps with them,

1338
01:25:05.081 --> 01:25:09.940
but we're sometimes the other advanced I'll broke.
Uh,

1339
01:25:10.890 --> 01:25:15.770
but so yeah,
I was mostly focused on just trying to treat these guys.
Um,

1340
01:25:16.660 --> 01:25:19.780
and
you know,

1341
01:25:20.800 --> 01:25:25.800
you need to convey information to the team leader and you need to tell the guy

1342
01:25:26.291 --> 01:25:29.560
you're,
yeah,
you're,
you're fine buddy.
You don't,
don't worry about that.

1343
01:25:29.561 --> 01:25:32.920
So at one point,
you know,
I'm John Dylan,
you're good dude.

1344
01:25:32.921 --> 01:25:37.060
We walked us off and then you kind of looking over the team leader meeting like,

1345
01:25:37.420 --> 01:25:38.380
no,
seriously,

1346
01:25:38.530 --> 01:25:43.390
he needs to go back and right now he needed to go a while ago,

1347
01:25:43.391 --> 01:25:48.040
but now we'll be fine too.
Um,
so,
and

1348
01:25:49.930 --> 01:25:53.140
I didn't really think about his perspective on it,
but you know,
later he's like,

1349
01:25:53.141 --> 01:25:55.690
yeah,
I was hearing it all to Mike.
Sorry about that.

1350
01:25:58.050 --> 01:26:01.380
<v 2>That's,
that's a,
a rough way to hear things.
So,</v>

1351
01:26:01.920 --> 01:26:04.280
so you had three guys wounded that position as well.

1352
01:26:04.910 --> 01:26:08.640
<v 4>So there was the,
the,
the three kind of a knit,</v>

1353
01:26:09.010 --> 01:26:13.700
the g two O two Americans initially credit critical and uh,

1354
01:26:13.730 --> 01:26:17.090
the one EC in and I,
so I started working on Dylan,

1355
01:26:17.990 --> 01:26:22.630
went over to Luis,
saw what,
what,
what had happened to him,
Luis Morales,
um,

1356
01:26:23.420 --> 01:26:27.560
and he had been shot through the thigh and through the ankle and both on the

1357
01:26:27.561 --> 01:26:32.120
right side.
And luckily it didn't hit any of the major vessels,

1358
01:26:32.121 --> 01:26:36.680
but it like four,
this is diet.
It just ripped it in half.

1359
01:26:36.681 --> 01:26:39.420
Like you could look all the way through,
just dial,

1360
01:26:39.421 --> 01:26:43.230
looked like you'd cut up and a fish and you were gutting it.
Um,

1361
01:26:43.610 --> 01:26:47.360
so while he wasn't,
you know,
he didn't hit a major artery.

1362
01:26:47.361 --> 01:26:51.890
It's just so much tissue damage that the way this could still form compartment

1363
01:26:51.891 --> 01:26:54.650
syndrome gets,
they'll kill him many different ways.

1364
01:26:55.460 --> 01:26:59.870
So I start working,
you know,
assess him and you know,

1365
01:26:59.871 --> 01:27:03.140
just doing those first sweeps,
like I'm not trying to do anything definitive yet.

1366
01:27:03.140 --> 01:27:03.710
It's just like,

1367
01:27:03.710 --> 01:27:08.360
let me figure out what all is going on and then I'll come back through.
Uh,

1368
01:27:08.750 --> 01:27:09.740
so after seeing Luis,

1369
01:27:09.741 --> 01:27:14.350
I still felt like I owed CK an actual check.

1370
01:27:14.430 --> 01:27:17.630
Um,
this is the interpreter,
the interpreter,
he was,

1371
01:27:19.730 --> 01:27:22.970
he was dead,
but I still owed him,
like

1372
01:27:24.590 --> 01:27:28.540
unless I know what killed him,
maybe he's still alive.
Uh,

1373
01:27:28.550 --> 01:27:31.100
so I went up to the,
checked on him.
He'd,

1374
01:27:31.101 --> 01:27:34.910
he'd been shot just behind the left ear and yeah,
it was,

1375
01:27:34.970 --> 01:27:38.990
it was an unsurvivable wound.
Um,
yeah,

1376
01:27:38.991 --> 01:27:43.740
so I checked on,
checked on him,
and then,
you know,

1377
01:27:43.741 --> 01:27:48.360
we just,
unfortunately,
with as little cover as we had for anything,

1378
01:27:48.361 --> 01:27:53.361
like he couldn't take up space where we had cover.

1379
01:27:53.430 --> 01:27:57.910
So we,
we just kind of had him off to the side a little bit,
uh,

1380
01:27:57.960 --> 01:28:01.080
but exposed to the elements because,

1381
01:28:02.620 --> 01:28:06.390
you know,
unfortunately the living guys didn't have enough space.

1382
01:28:07.470 --> 01:28:10.320
So after checking on him,

1383
01:28:10.350 --> 01:28:14.790
I kind of go back through and obviously this entire time we're still getting

1384
01:28:14.791 --> 01:28:17.160
shot out.
You can still feel those spirits gone by.

1385
01:28:17.161 --> 01:28:20.910
You could still feel the dirt kicking up.
Uh,

1386
01:28:24.390 --> 01:28:28.950
yeah,
there's,
there's just,
everything's so tight in there and so little space,

1387
01:28:28.951 --> 01:28:31.740
like I'm trying to kneel over these guys to

1388
01:28:33.340 --> 01:28:34.750
do the best I can for them.
And,

1389
01:28:35.350 --> 01:28:39.260
and as things are just falling on us or trying to cover them as things,
you know,

1390
01:28:39.280 --> 01:28:42.250
just rocks are coming down,
explosion,
they're happening.

1391
01:28:42.251 --> 01:28:46.660
Just trying to get at some point they start calling in for fire.
Is that,

1392
01:28:46.661 --> 01:28:48.870
is that happening yet?
Uh,
the,

1393
01:28:49.750 --> 01:28:54.650
the uh,
calls for fire came in,
they started pretty quickly.
Um,

1394
01:28:55.270 --> 01:28:58.330
Zach Reiner was our air force combat controller that day.

1395
01:28:58.331 --> 01:29:03.280
He got the Air Force Cross.
Very deservedly so,
uh,
being,

1396
01:29:04.360 --> 01:29:05.193
you know,

1397
01:29:05.430 --> 01:29:09.990
all of us are alive because of all the stuff that he called in the day.

1398
01:29:10.170 --> 01:29:14.760
<v 2>Yeah.
Um,
he's dropping bombs,
danger close,
drop them 2000 pounder.</v>

1399
01:29:15.150 --> 01:29:18.900
I mean,
he,
he's dropping the stuff and again,

1400
01:29:18.901 --> 01:29:22.380
you don't want him talking about this as if I knows or what it looks like.

1401
01:29:22.381 --> 01:29:26.160
Cause I saw you can watch these videos and you can see the bombs hitting in

1402
01:29:26.161 --> 01:29:30.240
massive hitting that castle and massive bombs hitting that castle.
And even,

1403
01:29:30.270 --> 01:29:33.210
even the bombs had hit that castle.
They day they do damage,

1404
01:29:33.211 --> 01:29:36.630
but that castle was massive and crazy.

1405
01:29:36.900 --> 01:29:41.790
<v 4>You know,
we ended up through the course of the day,
um,
one of our Afghans,</v>

1406
01:29:42.080 --> 01:29:46.570
uh,
broke his leg,
the wood framing on a building,

1407
01:29:46.571 --> 01:29:50.610
they got blown up,
broke his leg.
So we gotta we gotta deal with that.

1408
01:29:50.611 --> 01:29:54.540
You're getting just all the other wounds that are coming,
uh,
with those.

1409
01:29:54.670 --> 01:29:58.420
<v 2>Could this cause massive debris is coming down on you guys from those danger</v>

1410
01:29:58.421 --> 01:30:00.250
close hits,

1411
01:30:00.580 --> 01:30:05.380
bomb drops and it like debris is coming down on you guys because you guys are

1412
01:30:05.381 --> 01:30:07.150
below it down a cliff,

1413
01:30:07.590 --> 01:30:10.320
<v 4>right at,
at one point,</v>

1414
01:30:10.321 --> 01:30:14.640
I don't remember exactly where in the sequence of events.
Uh,

1415
01:30:16.230 --> 01:30:19.860
basically I can say we kind of had that wall on our left that went straight up

1416
01:30:20.190 --> 01:30:21.090
and there was,

1417
01:30:21.510 --> 01:30:26.070
there was a building there and they were getting in that and starting to just

1418
01:30:26.071 --> 01:30:30.720
shoot down at us.
And so that had to go away.

1419
01:30:31.950 --> 01:30:36.450
So,
uh,
Zach ended up calling in a strike,
hit that.
And

1420
01:30:38.520 --> 01:30:41.040
I don't go hunting too much for footage online,
but I don't,

1421
01:30:41.041 --> 01:30:44.730
I've seen it through the military side.
You can,

1422
01:30:44.940 --> 01:30:48.510
you can actually hear the pilot come on the radio after he drops that one.

1423
01:30:48.511 --> 01:30:49.344
He's like

1424
01:30:49.400 --> 01:30:51.750
<v 2>not feel good about that one yet.
That's how danger close it was.</v>

1425
01:30:51.760 --> 01:30:53.290
It was so dangerous.
Close at the pilot,

1426
01:30:53.291 --> 01:30:56.650
comes on the radio afterwards and says he goes,
that was real close.

1427
01:30:56.651 --> 01:30:59.360
I don't feel good about that one.
Meaning you could hear the,

1428
01:30:59.760 --> 01:31:03.070
the sickness in his voice thinking,
how do we just kill our own guys?

1429
01:31:03.071 --> 01:31:04.640
You just killed everyone.
And of course

1430
01:31:04.720 --> 01:31:07.350
<v 4>for us,
you know,
we're covered and we're getting covered in debris.</v>

1431
01:31:07.370 --> 01:31:10.180
We're getting just rained on stuff.
But we're like,

1432
01:31:10.920 --> 01:31:11.753
<v 2>thanks dude.</v>

1433
01:31:14.470 --> 01:31:19.110
Talk totally insane.
So at what point did you guys decide,
okay,

1434
01:31:19.111 --> 01:31:23.390
we gotta get Outta here?
Uh,
or were you still thinking of it?

1435
01:31:23.391 --> 01:31:25.910
Maybe we'll just get done with this assault up the hill.
At that point,

1436
01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:30.750
<v 4>we're pretty much done at that point.
Um,
so Scott,
for his name sergeant,</v>

1437
01:31:30.840 --> 01:31:33.210
he comes in,
like I said,
he,
he was,
you know,

1438
01:31:33.300 --> 01:31:37.590
right there with us moving up the hill,
uh,
bringing on those,
those extra guys.

1439
01:31:37.591 --> 01:31:38.424
And he started,

1440
01:31:39.300 --> 01:31:44.280
I'm working on trying to keep these guys alive and he starts to working that,

1441
01:31:44.310 --> 01:31:47.120
let's get them out of here.
Peace.
Um,

1442
01:31:47.280 --> 01:31:51.850
so our lead element,
it actually made the edge of the village and like,

1443
01:31:52.930 --> 01:31:57.930
I think they got into at least one building and so they're starting to hope we

1444
01:31:58.391 --> 01:32:02.140
got that foothold.
Like we,
we made it guys,
we were mine.

1445
01:32:02.720 --> 01:32:06.360
Uh,
but so he makes that call.
Okay,
we got,

1446
01:32:06.400 --> 01:32:10.330
we've got to pull those guys back.
Yeah.
To start getting,

1447
01:32:10.580 --> 01:32:14.260
<v 2>which is actually incredible to even have gotten to that.
And,</v>

1448
01:32:14.261 --> 01:32:17.150
and to be honest with you if things,
now that I'm,
you know,

1449
01:32:17.160 --> 01:32:19.760
I'm talking about how much I would've just,
you know,
bailed out of there.

1450
01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:23.450
Once you get a foothold in that situation,
now it's,
you know,

1451
01:32:23.451 --> 01:32:26.060
it's going to be CQC,
us against them.
Like you,

1452
01:32:26.260 --> 01:32:28.610
you actually have a pretty good chance,
you know,
well,

1453
01:32:28.640 --> 01:32:30.920
you got a hundred commandos or we get 'em up that hill,

1454
01:32:31.040 --> 01:32:34.130
you get a foothold in that building.
It's like,
okay,
we're not in that castle.

1455
01:32:34.131 --> 01:32:36.890
We can start taking it out.
So that's,
that's impressive man.

1456
01:32:37.280 --> 01:32:38.630
Props to you guys for sure.

1457
01:32:38.910 --> 01:32:43.270
<v 4>Yeah.
The,
uh,
fortunately as bad as it's started</v>

1458
01:32:45.160 --> 01:32:48.280
for quite a while through the day,
it actually,
it kept getting worse.

1459
01:32:49.570 --> 01:32:51.560
Like it never stopped.
Um,

1460
01:32:52.380 --> 01:32:57.310
I think we started to get some laws after we'd done so many airstrikes,
but,

1461
01:32:57.311 --> 01:32:59.290
uh,
so the,

1462
01:32:59.291 --> 01:33:04.150
the side of the mountain that I went up a little bit later in the day,

1463
01:33:04.151 --> 01:33:05.770
like it was just no man's land.

1464
01:33:06.190 --> 01:33:10.190
You didn't go over there if you wanted to not be dead.
Um,

1465
01:33:10.690 --> 01:33:15.690
so the logistics of trying to get an actual fighting for us,

1466
01:33:16.330 --> 01:33:20.650
even though we had a foothold,
it,
it just became an untenable position.

1467
01:33:21.490 --> 01:33:25.070
So,
you know,
I'm working on these guys.
I'm,

1468
01:33:25.220 --> 01:33:29.800
I'm trying to get some kind of hemorrhage control,

1469
01:33:29.830 --> 01:33:34.730
bleeding control on,
on Dylan,
uh,
B,

1470
01:33:34.750 --> 01:33:39.580
no,
with Louis,
I didn't quick,
uh,
quick treatments on him.

1471
01:33:39.610 --> 01:33:44.420
Got His bandaged up as well as I could,
so that way.
Yeah,

1472
01:33:44.440 --> 01:33:47.970
just we'll all that trauma.
He didn't end up,
you know,

1473
01:33:48.280 --> 01:33:50.830
still stuff dying on me on the mountain just from,

1474
01:33:50.980 --> 01:33:53.680
from some something.

1475
01:33:53.681 --> 01:33:58.681
I'm still working on Dylan and said it

1476
01:34:01.600 --> 01:34:05.900
based on what he was describing to me.
Like I didn't see the point of like,
yeah,

1477
01:34:05.910 --> 01:34:08.790
they in the medical arts they teach you like,
oh,
you can,
you know,

1478
01:34:08.791 --> 01:34:12.250
you press on a pelvis down and then you squeeze it and that's how you'll see if

1479
01:34:12.251 --> 01:34:12.941
it's broken or not.

1480
01:34:12.941 --> 01:34:17.941
Like I didn't see the point in doing that to him just where the wound was.

1481
01:34:18.430 --> 01:34:21.580
Like something in there is broke.
Uh,

1482
01:34:21.820 --> 01:34:25.690
he's not going to benefit from me jumping up and down on it,

1483
01:34:25.691 --> 01:34:29.140
just on it of define our good dude.
You're,
your pelvis was broke.

1484
01:34:29.440 --> 01:34:33.610
Sorry about that.
Uh,
so,
eh,

1485
01:34:33.910 --> 01:34:37.240
but he was also describing like,
oh,
my foot doesn't feel like it's straight.

1486
01:34:37.280 --> 01:34:42.040
Like nothing feels like it's lining up.
Right.
And no,
it wasn't because the,

1487
01:34:42.100 --> 01:34:45.510
we'd find out later that,
you know,
the boy had gone through is for moral head.
Um,

1488
01:34:45.511 --> 01:34:50.170
so shatter that did a bunch of damage to the,
the pelvis itself.

1489
01:34:50.960 --> 01:34:55.000
Um,
so I'm just seeing this site,

1490
01:34:55.400 --> 01:34:57.980
you're looking at what I,
what I can physically see Emily.

1491
01:34:57.981 --> 01:35:00.680
I don't think it hit an artery,

1492
01:35:01.400 --> 01:35:03.710
but if it hit the pelvis,

1493
01:35:04.040 --> 01:35:08.690
and it's been a while since I was a medic,
but you know,
I remember having those,

1494
01:35:08.840 --> 01:35:10.310
those numbers in my head like,
okay,

1495
01:35:10.320 --> 01:35:15.320
a pelvic fracture is going to cause this much bleeding and a for moral factor is

1496
01:35:16.221 --> 01:35:19.730
going to cost this much bleeding and trying to process those things like,
okay,

1497
01:35:19.731 --> 01:35:24.050
he's not,
he's not bleeding out,
but he's still gonna bleed out on me.

1498
01:35:24.460 --> 01:35:25.293
Uh,

1499
01:35:26.120 --> 01:35:31.120
so it was so high up you couldn't put a tourniquet on it couldn't really do

1500
01:35:31.641 --> 01:35:31.940
anything.

1501
01:35:31.940 --> 01:35:36.940
So it just came up with the idea that I had a cell ox,

1502
01:35:37.311 --> 01:35:41.540
a hemostatic agent.
It would designed to stop bleeding.
I had a

1503
01:35:43.310 --> 01:35:46.130
powder of that.
So what I did it,

1504
01:35:46.131 --> 01:35:50.510
I just kinda started pouring that on the wound and then taking my fingers and

1505
01:35:50.511 --> 01:35:54.920
shoving it into the wound because the wound was so small.
Entry.
Windsor.

1506
01:35:56.040 --> 01:36:00.110
Yeah.
Not Big.
So to start shoving that in there,

1507
01:36:00.111 --> 01:36:04.250
trying to get as much in as I could and just repeating that process over and

1508
01:36:04.251 --> 01:36:08.630
over until I felt like I had enough.
I don't know,

1509
01:36:09.270 --> 01:36:12.150
just it was just the scientific,
just just kind of gut call,

1510
01:36:12.151 --> 01:36:16.820
shoving fingers in your buddy,
be like,
hopefully it will help.
Uh,

1511
01:36:16.821 --> 01:36:21.710
then wrapped them up as well as I could.
And so while I'm doing this,

1512
01:36:21.711 --> 01:36:26.711
that's when the lead element started to get back towards us and they were going

1513
01:36:29.361 --> 01:36:34.361
to help us start to get these guys out of there and within

1514
01:36:36.350 --> 01:36:39.860
moments,
minutes,
whatever it was of them getting,
getting there.

1515
01:36:39.860 --> 01:36:43.940
That's when we took our next American casualty.

1516
01:36:44.090 --> 01:36:48.920
John Walden had been hit mother right?

1517
01:36:48.980 --> 01:36:52.970
Rightly just below the need,
basically stay amputated his leg right away.

1518
01:36:53.510 --> 01:36:57.220
It was hanging on by a little bit,
but it,
it just amputated it.
Um,

1519
01:36:58.520 --> 01:37:03.440
so the hemostatic agents that are out there,
they've gotten better now,

1520
01:37:03.441 --> 01:37:06.830
but at the time it was,
you know,
you have to hold pressure for five minutes,

1521
01:37:07.880 --> 01:37:11.030
otherwise maybe the clot will break and then now he's going to bleed inside

1522
01:37:11.031 --> 01:37:15.710
there and you'll never see it.
And so started yelling at somebody,

1523
01:37:15.711 --> 01:37:18.080
get a tourniquet on him.
They do.

1524
01:37:18.950 --> 01:37:22.880
And now he's just stacked up,
you know,
taking a more,

1525
01:37:23.940 --> 01:37:27.290
more,
uh,
real estate for us.
Uh,

1526
01:37:28.460 --> 01:37:33.290
so our team Sergeant Scott,
he's trying to figure out,

1527
01:37:33.291 --> 01:37:37.220
okay,
now we have,
you know,
another casualty.

1528
01:37:37.550 --> 01:37:38.660
So we,
we,

1529
01:37:39.740 --> 01:37:43.510
we headed to another negative and we lost a positive cause now it's,

1530
01:37:43.670 --> 01:37:48.230
that's a dude who can't help move.
And so,
you know,
at that point he's very,

1531
01:37:48.960 --> 01:37:52.040
I know at this point it's very clear we're,
we're done with the mountain.

1532
01:37:52.250 --> 01:37:54.430
We just need to go home.
Uh,

1533
01:37:55.530 --> 01:37:59.760
so yeah,
we're still,
we're still working on them.
I know,
I know.

1534
01:37:59.761 --> 01:38:04.680
I was working on,
on Dylan and,
um,

1535
01:38:05.010 --> 01:38:09.930
Scott ends up getting shot for the first time in the chest plate.

1536
01:38:11.010 --> 01:38:14.730
And so I run over to him at this point,
check him.

1537
01:38:16.560 --> 01:38:19.350
You know,
I hesitate to say he's fine,
but he's fine.

1538
01:38:20.220 --> 01:38:24.780
The jetway did its job.
He's,
he's obviously going to feel that for a few days.

1539
01:38:25.640 --> 01:38:27.480
Uh,
so I go back,

1540
01:38:27.840 --> 01:38:32.460
keep trying to package up these guys a little bit more and we're just,

1541
01:38:34.320 --> 01:38:37.740
you know,
it's,
it's tough not to gloss over like

1542
01:38:39.720 --> 01:38:42.990
minor wounds.
Like,
you know,
this guy just got more shrapnel wounds,

1543
01:38:42.991 --> 01:38:46.540
like quick check,
you're fine.
Move on.
Um,

1544
01:38:46.590 --> 01:38:49.350
one of our commanders at some point in all of this,

1545
01:38:49.750 --> 01:38:53.220
another one of our commandos got shot in the head.
Um,

1546
01:38:53.390 --> 01:38:57.960
he dropped instantly.
I'm like,
well that dude's a hundred percent dead.

1547
01:38:58.620 --> 01:39:02.880
Uh,
but later pull him back over.
And I'm like,
no,

1548
01:39:02.881 --> 01:39:04.860
he's actually still alive.
He was,

1549
01:39:05.430 --> 01:39:10.430
he just decided to take a little nap out there on the edge of the money amount,

1550
01:39:10.890 --> 01:39:14.670
but it,
did you know,
it,
there's weird things bullets do.

1551
01:39:14.671 --> 01:39:17.130
It had dented the his head,

1552
01:39:17.520 --> 01:39:21.180
but it didn't,
she didn't kill him.

1553
01:39:21.181 --> 01:39:25.770
So we're just continuing to just accumulate these problems.
Um,

1554
01:39:26.370 --> 01:39:31.370
and so working Scott ends up turning around to say something to us and that's

1555
01:39:35.401 --> 01:39:38.160
when he got shot again this time in the left arm.

1556
01:39:39.360 --> 01:39:43.710
And it almost amputates his left arm,
but not nothing compared to

1557
01:39:45.220 --> 01:39:48.570
the visual image that uh,
John's had had.

1558
01:39:50.250 --> 01:39:52.740
And I think it was the same bullet.

1559
01:39:52.980 --> 01:39:57.240
Was it a bullet right after on a burst?
I can't say for sure,

1560
01:39:57.241 --> 01:40:00.720
but it was at the same time that he got shot in the left arm.

1561
01:40:00.720 --> 01:40:03.140
I got hit in the head.
Um,

1562
01:40:03.930 --> 01:40:07.800
and so I had my helmet back on at this point,
so I got hit in the head.

1563
01:40:08.430 --> 01:40:13.430
And so working on Dylan and I'm trying to ask him like in my,

1564
01:40:14.881 --> 01:40:19.380
all right,
like I,
I don't know.
Um,
but you know,

1565
01:40:19.590 --> 01:40:22.590
trying to do a blood sweeps are trying to figure out,
okay,

1566
01:40:22.600 --> 01:40:25.800
have so much blood or he can even tell everywhere.

1567
01:40:25.801 --> 01:40:28.600
Like I don't know if I'm bleeding,
so I'm asking you.
No,

1568
01:40:28.680 --> 01:40:33.120
I'm asking him what I'm working on.
Like how am I,

1569
01:40:33.180 --> 01:40:38.130
am I okay?
Can I,
can I keep going?
Uh,
but he's like,

1570
01:40:38.131 --> 01:40:40.700
yeah,
you're,
you're fine.
Um,

1571
01:40:42.060 --> 01:40:45.570
I don't know remember exactly what he said,

1572
01:40:45.571 --> 01:40:48.420
but he conveyed,
yeah,
you're fine.

1573
01:40:49.050 --> 01:40:53.350
So I grabbed journey get wound.
Yeah.
Luckily,
I mean the helmet,

1574
01:40:53.530 --> 01:40:57.460
the helmet did its job,
so it wasn't,
um,
it wasn't,
it didn't do anything to me.

1575
01:40:57.820 --> 01:41:02.560
It felt like I got hit with a baseball bat and like just how I describe it feels

1576
01:41:02.590 --> 01:41:05.950
like what you would think it would.
Um,

1577
01:41:06.940 --> 01:41:11.740
so I grabbed a tourniquet run out to Scott,
put a tourniquet on his,
his left arm.

1578
01:41:12.370 --> 01:41:17.240
Uh,
there's just
fall,

1579
01:41:17.710 --> 01:41:19.930
there's nowhere to put people.
Um,

1580
01:41:20.380 --> 01:41:25.380
luckily he's of of the serious injuries we've,

1581
01:41:25.631 --> 01:41:28.750
we're accumulating,
he's the only ambulatory guy.

1582
01:41:28.751 --> 01:41:33.751
So basically he self evacuated down the same side of the mountain that we had

1583
01:41:35.261 --> 01:41:38.530
come up and you know,
where the fire was,
continue to get worse.
But there was,

1584
01:41:39.220 --> 01:41:41.470
there was some guys a set,
Howard and Matt Williams,

1585
01:41:41.770 --> 01:41:43.210
they're doing good work over there.

1586
01:41:43.570 --> 01:41:48.570
And so basically he kind of got down there and they see him with his arm and

1587
01:41:50.561 --> 01:41:54.240
they're like,
we'll get you,
we'll get you taken care of.
So they were,

1588
01:41:54.241 --> 01:41:56.800
they worked him down down the mountain on that one side,

1589
01:41:58.720 --> 01:42:03.100
but that really only
only worked for him because he could do,

1590
01:42:03.260 --> 01:42:07.580
he could move everybody else is,
is uh,

1591
01:42:08.560 --> 01:42:13.520
not that mobile.
So,
uh,

1592
01:42:14.560 --> 01:42:18.530
Dave Sanders is kind of coming through and,
you know,
he's,

1593
01:42:19.590 --> 01:42:21.940
he's,
uh,
trying to figure out a route for us.

1594
01:42:21.941 --> 01:42:25.190
And so in my mind,

1595
01:42:25.240 --> 01:42:27.160
like what I just considered behind me now,

1596
01:42:28.270 --> 01:42:32.590
there's basically the cliff kind of just goes straight down,

1597
01:42:32.591 --> 01:42:37.450
but like any cliff,
there's,
there's a little terrorists over here.

1598
01:42:37.451 --> 01:42:40.120
It was a little terrorist over the Harris.
So he,

1599
01:42:41.020 --> 01:42:44.380
he's an exploring that route and he comes back up and ate.

1600
01:42:44.381 --> 01:42:48.040
Just comes to the simple,
like,
he's like,
this'll work.
And we're like,

1601
01:42:48.041 --> 01:42:50.560
is everybody getting a,
can these guys do it?
And he's like,

1602
01:42:50.561 --> 01:42:54.540
they probably won't die.
Well,
that's,
it's

1603
01:42:54.540 --> 01:42:57.990
<v 0>better than that we're at right now.
That's,
that's,
that's a good plan.</v>

1604
01:42:59.010 --> 01:43:03.930
So I got this one section of one other article I pulled out.

1605
01:43:03.931 --> 01:43:08.770
This is it,
it's somewhere around here.
And again,
it's,
it's like,
uh,
but I just,

1606
01:43:08.910 --> 01:43:09.421
uh,
this,

1607
01:43:09.421 --> 01:43:12.720
this left a really good picture in my mind of what was going on and kind of the,

1608
01:43:12.950 --> 01:43:15.810
the how critical the situation knows.

1609
01:43:15.990 --> 01:43:20.640
Walton Captain Walton was the,
uh,
was the element commander.

1610
01:43:20.641 --> 01:43:22.860
He's the,
the,
and he,
this is,

1611
01:43:23.490 --> 01:43:26.940
this is talking about him and he's got some quotes in here,

1612
01:43:27.090 --> 01:43:28.470
but this is from the stars and Stripes,

1613
01:43:28.471 --> 01:43:33.471
which is like a military newspaper overseas and it says,

1614
01:43:33.781 --> 01:43:38.520
Walton feared his force was on the verge of being overrun with the insurgence,

1615
01:43:38.521 --> 01:43:39.690
nearing his position,

1616
01:43:39.691 --> 01:43:44.691
Walt and reach for grenade and called an a massive danger close strike expecting

1617
01:43:45.151 --> 01:43:46.860
it could take out his entire team.

1618
01:43:48.240 --> 01:43:51.590
They were all prepared to make the ultimate sacrifice.

1619
01:43:51.591 --> 01:43:56.591
He said the bomb dropped and then he saw an image he would remember forever from

1620
01:43:59.571 --> 01:44:00.404
that fight,

1621
01:44:00.970 --> 01:44:05.900
his body draped over the injured man he'd been working on through the fight.

1622
01:44:06.200 --> 01:44:07.190
In that moment,

1623
01:44:07.880 --> 01:44:11.840
the strike that we had called in on our own position detonated just above us and

1624
01:44:11.841 --> 01:44:14.900
blocked out the sun as the dust settled.

1625
01:44:15.050 --> 01:44:20.050
Ron sure was the first thing that I saw on top of his wounded teammates

1626
01:44:20.360 --> 01:44:21.380
protecting them.

1627
01:44:21.560 --> 01:44:26.560
Even to the end when we had all fully accepted that we were going to go down

1628
01:44:27.291 --> 01:44:32.291
fighting Ron sure was still thinking of others.

1629
01:44:38.080 --> 01:44:41.240
<v 4>Yeah.
Like I mean like he says in there,
it definitely,</v>

1630
01:44:42.890 --> 01:44:46.670
definitely got to the point where like,
okay,
this is,

1631
01:44:47.600 --> 01:44:49.510
this is the day.
Uh,

1632
01:44:50.870 --> 01:44:54.740
I don't know how everybody kind of just process that.

1633
01:44:55.490 --> 01:44:56.270
Um,

1634
01:44:56.270 --> 01:45:01.270
I know for me there was a point where I just said a quick prayer just asking God

1635
01:45:04.111 --> 01:45:08.480
to help me.
Uh,
my wife Miranda and our,
our son,

1636
01:45:08.481 --> 01:45:12.940
who at the time was a couple of days shy of three months old.
Uh,

1637
01:45:12.950 --> 01:45:17.060
just make sure they're cool with,
with,
uh,

1638
01:45:17.061 --> 01:45:18.110
what's about to happen

1639
01:45:19.730 --> 01:45:22.520
and then just go back to work and just,

1640
01:45:24.950 --> 01:45:26.480
you're taking it in little chunks is,

1641
01:45:27.290 --> 01:45:32.170
it's too big to try and think of a week

1642
01:45:33.980 --> 01:45:38.700
over the course of the day.
May the,
for us critical,
um,

1643
01:45:39.110 --> 01:45:43.430
three other US wounded to Kiaa about

1644
01:45:45.590 --> 01:45:49.940
13,
14,
15 Afghan commandos interpreters wounded.

1645
01:45:51.080 --> 01:45:54.650
And so it,
you know,
in just terms of those numbers,

1646
01:45:54.651 --> 01:45:58.520
that's too much to deal with.
But if I just,
you know,

1647
01:45:59.300 --> 01:46:00.980
this is the worst thing and going on right now,

1648
01:46:00.981 --> 01:46:03.710
I'm going to deal with this and then come up for air and look around.

1649
01:46:04.700 --> 01:46:07.250
That's now the worst thing.
So I'm going to over there,
I'm gonna deal with that.

1650
01:46:08.030 --> 01:46:12.710
And so you just keep taking it on little chunks,
keep working,
working through it.

1651
01:46:13.440 --> 01:46:16.160
At some point you started working towards,
okay,
we've got to get these guys down,

1652
01:46:16.280 --> 01:46:18.820
we're going to start lowering these guys down.
So,
uh,

1653
01:46:20.330 --> 01:46:22.370
Dave Sanders figure it out.
Okay,
this is,

1654
01:46:23.660 --> 01:46:26.060
this is the least bad option.

1655
01:46:26.750 --> 01:46:31.750
So I just started getting everybody ready to go.

1656
01:46:31.870 --> 01:46:32.703
Um,

1657
01:46:32.960 --> 01:46:37.340
kind of started with how many of these guys who were up here,

1658
01:46:38.270 --> 01:46:41.810
Luis has a really bad injury,

1659
01:46:41.811 --> 01:46:44.660
but he's stable enough.

1660
01:46:44.720 --> 01:46:49.720
I gave him a fentanyl lollipop so he's not feeling too bad like you're going

1661
01:46:50.581 --> 01:46:52.830
first.
So we got him,

1662
01:46:52.831 --> 01:46:57.831
I'd just do a double check on on the guy and then go over to the of the edge of

1663
01:46:59.371 --> 01:47:01.770
the cliff and start working them down is,

1664
01:47:02.910 --> 01:47:06.530
and depending on how bad their their went,

1665
01:47:06.531 --> 01:47:09.000
well like always could help himself a lot.

1666
01:47:09.001 --> 01:47:13.180
So like I was getting ready to get them over the edge and uh,

1667
01:47:15.810 --> 01:47:20.400
Dave and uh,
why,
why am I forgetting our combat camera guys named Mike Carter.

1668
01:47:20.840 --> 01:47:21.673
Uh,

1669
01:47:21.870 --> 01:47:26.460
they kind of take them the rest of the way down the hill and then I'd go back up

1670
01:47:26.461 --> 01:47:28.380
to our low position.
All right.

1671
01:47:28.440 --> 01:47:33.390
Next serious one was Dylan.
Okay.
Getting him ready.
He had,

1672
01:47:34.100 --> 01:47:36.810
I got an IV started on,
I've got a few different things going.

1673
01:47:36.811 --> 01:47:40.890
I got everything is ready as I could send him over.

1674
01:47:41.040 --> 01:47:45.000
All that stuff was ripped out and just mangled by the time we got to the bottom.

1675
01:47:45.001 --> 01:47:48.200
But well,
it is what it is.
That's,

1676
01:47:48.990 --> 01:47:51.920
that's now what we're the with later.
Um,

1677
01:47:52.800 --> 01:47:57.480
so then it came time to uh,
uh,
got over to,

1678
01:47:57.740 --> 01:47:58.820
<v 1>uh Huh.</v>

1679
01:48:01.870 --> 01:48:05.710
<v 4>John Walden,
uh,
started doing an assessment on him</v>

1680
01:48:07.330 --> 01:48:10.750
just through the variances of battle.
And,

1681
01:48:11.250 --> 01:48:15.990
and everything has his tourniquet.
It had been placed properly,

1682
01:48:16.690 --> 01:48:21.490
um,
which is vessel.
Sometimes we'll relax or attention or tense up.

1683
01:48:21.491 --> 01:48:25.480
Just so he,
it was at that point,
he's actually brilliant quite profusely.

1684
01:48:26.160 --> 01:48:30.330
Um,
so we had to make some adjustments on his Turner,

1685
01:48:30.331 --> 01:48:34.740
get get him restabilize just had him

1686
01:48:36.960 --> 01:48:41.630
hold his leg,
just give them something to do and you know,

1687
01:48:41.670 --> 01:48:46.110
waste that lowered him down the hill.
And as we're,

1688
01:48:46.190 --> 01:48:47.510
we're kind of finishing that up,
Mike,

1689
01:48:47.910 --> 01:48:51.930
all of the ambulatory commando and interpreter cash these,

1690
01:48:51.931 --> 01:48:56.610
they're kind of working their way down through all of this as well.
Uh,

1691
01:48:57.660 --> 01:49:01.560
Seth Howard and Matt Williams or had kind of mentioned earlier,

1692
01:49:01.561 --> 01:49:06.561
like they came through right behind us just kicking off everybody else that

1693
01:49:08.880 --> 01:49:10.500
hadn't got the message.
It was time to go.

1694
01:49:10.501 --> 01:49:14.640
Or like CK who had been killed,
they got,

1695
01:49:14.700 --> 01:49:18.050
they got him off for us.
The African commando who we

1696
01:49:21.570 --> 01:49:24.270
didn't really have a great plan for.

1697
01:49:24.690 --> 01:49:27.010
We've got him off and we just got everybody down.

1698
01:49:27.040 --> 01:49:31.470
Started setting up of the casualty collection point down there at the bottom of

1699
01:49:31.471 --> 01:49:32.304
the hill.

1700
01:49:36.070 --> 01:49:36.903
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

1701
01:49:37.340 --> 01:49:41.330
<v 4>Hawaii,
you're climbing down stuff still exploding.
You still getting shot at.</v>

1702
01:49:41.840 --> 01:49:42.673
Uh,

1703
01:49:44.060 --> 01:49:48.970
but by the time we got down to the,
the valley again,

1704
01:49:48.971 --> 01:49:51.870
it was wait a little bit more recovery.

1705
01:49:51.871 --> 01:49:54.940
It was everything that day was just,

1706
01:49:55.780 --> 01:50:00.220
this sucks less than that.
So I'm going to do,
I'm going to do this.

1707
01:50:01.270 --> 01:50:05.620
Uh,
so at that point,
you know,
we've got everybody off,

1708
01:50:06.590 --> 01:50:11.290
got to go through,
recheck everybody now because we've now moved,

1709
01:50:11.350 --> 01:50:13.400
moved all the patients,
um,

1710
01:50:15.310 --> 01:50:19.780
long since
out of most of my supplies.

1711
01:50:20.230 --> 01:50:24.460
So then it comes down to,
well,
you do need a bandage,

1712
01:50:25.570 --> 01:50:30.010
but he needs it more,
but you're going to be fine without one.
Uh,

1713
01:50:30.490 --> 01:50:32.140
and just kind of keep making those calls.

1714
01:50:33.280 --> 01:50:38.170
How long did it take for CAS EVAC to show up?
Uh,
so

1715
01:50:40.320 --> 01:50:45.100
we'd never really got,
like,
I dedicated a cas back to come in that day.

1716
01:50:45.100 --> 01:50:49.840
We had some black hawks that we're supporting the mission up there,

1717
01:50:49.841 --> 01:50:53.890
and those pilots were awesome.

1718
01:50:54.700 --> 01:50:59.500
They're like,
there's wounded,
we're going to come in.
It's hot,

1719
01:51:00.550 --> 01:51:02.290
they're fine with it.
They know what's going on.

1720
01:51:02.830 --> 01:51:05.800
So they came in and we got a,

1721
01:51:05.950 --> 01:51:08.560
the first group load it up and out,

1722
01:51:08.590 --> 01:51:12.190
and then they came in again and got the next group.

1723
01:51:12.880 --> 01:51:17.470
So basically we got all the critical and all the nonambulatory people out of

1724
01:51:17.471 --> 01:51:20.530
there and then everybody else just think,
you,

1725
01:51:20.680 --> 01:51:23.110
you just got to walk out of here.

1726
01:51:23.590 --> 01:51:27.640
There's no other than I was going to come for you.
Uh,

1727
01:51:29.020 --> 01:51:34.020
it was at some point around this time when I'm down down in the valley working

1728
01:51:36.570 --> 01:51:41.570
is that point that can notice my arm is starting to hurt a little bit and

1729
01:51:44.710 --> 01:51:48.040
they just look at my arm arms there.
It's fine,
whatever.

1730
01:51:49.450 --> 01:51:51.970
Just,
you know,
if you bang your elbow on something,

1731
01:51:51.971 --> 01:51:56.220
you just got to shake it out and you move on with your day.
Um,

1732
01:51:56.800 --> 01:52:01.660
it was later that night,
you know,
get back to the base.

1733
01:52:02.430 --> 01:52:05.860
Uh,
after we went and saw the wounded guys go and take a shower,

1734
01:52:06.340 --> 01:52:10.000
I noticed I have to cut on my arm and bruising around my elbow.

1735
01:52:10.050 --> 01:52:13.630
I was like that,
that wasn't there earlier.

1736
01:52:14.860 --> 01:52:15.693
Uh,

1737
01:52:15.880 --> 01:52:20.880
went and found my uniform and it's got that bullet hole in it.

1738
01:52:20.891 --> 01:52:25.210
And I was like,
oh,
I don't have any idea.

1739
01:52:25.840 --> 01:52:30.070
It's so important to have around when,
when that went through a

1740
01:52:31.990 --> 01:52:35.530
bad,
it just is one of those days like as bad as it was,

1741
01:52:36.820 --> 01:52:37.653
you know,
you,

1742
01:52:38.410 --> 01:52:41.890
you just an inch this way.

1743
01:52:42.450 --> 01:52:47.450
Meaning I think we'd done the math before and it was like we came up with like

1744
01:52:48.321 --> 01:52:49.530
eight inches or something.
I can,

1745
01:52:49.570 --> 01:52:54.500
if the enemy just could move a bullet eight inches over the course of the day,

1746
01:52:54.530 --> 01:52:56.390
like move this bullet one inch this way,

1747
01:52:56.391 --> 01:52:59.840
move this bullet this way they

1748
01:53:01.530 --> 01:53:06.410
would have just killed everybody.
Like one of the guys got shot through the,

1749
01:53:06.560 --> 01:53:08.360
his camel back,
you know,

1750
01:53:08.400 --> 01:53:13.220
it bursts that it hit like he had a flare in the bacteria there,
done that.

1751
01:53:13.221 --> 01:53:18.221
But at that you just inch that Dylan who had the bullet skim between his armor

1752
01:53:19.371 --> 01:53:23.060
and is is Gary.
He moved that and um,

1753
01:53:24.020 --> 01:53:25.840
but that's how combat is it how

1754
01:53:28.700 --> 01:53:33.410
you train you,
you get is good and proficient as you can.

1755
01:53:33.411 --> 01:53:38.210
And then hope for a little bit,
a little bit of luck as well.

1756
01:53:39.510 --> 01:53:42.320
<v 5>You guys and you,
I know you lost two,</v>

1757
01:53:42.350 --> 01:53:44.810
well you lost your one interpreter killed.

1758
01:53:45.470 --> 01:53:49.670
Well a C K and then one Afghan soldier killed.
Yeah.
Um,

1759
01:53:50.120 --> 01:53:54.710
but none of the Americans were killed.
No,

1760
01:53:54.711 --> 01:53:59.180
none of the Americans completely.
That's a miracle.

1761
01:53:59.330 --> 01:54:00.163
It's incredible.

1762
01:54:00.240 --> 01:54:01.310
<v 4>Yeah.
Uh,</v>

1763
01:54:02.680 --> 01:54:07.680
Bardeen he was the Afghan first sergeant.

1764
01:54:08.460 --> 01:54:13.460
He was on that SF team knows when the blocking down the valley at some point

1765
01:54:13.861 --> 01:54:18.861
they came up to kind of help us do that final policing up of everything.

1766
01:54:19.470 --> 01:54:22.740
And he was,
he was,
he was a great forest,
harder for them.

1767
01:54:22.741 --> 01:54:27.300
He was leading from the front like he should and he caught around just below

1768
01:54:27.301 --> 01:54:32.260
that chest plate is that your order is a Vena Cava.
Doesn't much matter.
Um,

1769
01:54:32.880 --> 01:54:37.440
but he dropped and
that was it.
So as,

1770
01:54:39.270 --> 01:54:44.190
as rough as the day was and as much as you kinda go through after the fact,

1771
01:54:44.191 --> 01:54:49.080
like what could I have done better?
What could have
been here a little fast,

1772
01:54:49.081 --> 01:54:53.070
you'd done that shot that guy a little bit
quicker.

1773
01:54:54.870 --> 01:54:59.520
The only two
ks there was just,

1774
01:55:00.150 --> 01:55:02.090
there was nothing to be done for us.

1775
01:55:02.091 --> 01:55:05.760
So I eventually got comfortable with it all because of that.

1776
01:55:06.980 --> 01:55:10.190
<v 5>And then what,
when your team,
what did they even do with your team now?</v>

1777
01:55:10.520 --> 01:55:13.790
You guys come back,
you got all these casualties.
Did they stand you guys down?

1778
01:55:13.820 --> 01:55:16.230
They send you home,
would they do with you?
Uh,

1779
01:55:18.020 --> 01:55:20.900
<v 4>no.
So after we got everybody,</v>

1780
01:55:21.710 --> 01:55:23.800
all the wounded guys out,
uh,

1781
01:55:24.800 --> 01:55:29.150
eventually we kind of regrouped and we go down,
back,
back to the infill point,

1782
01:55:29.690 --> 01:55:34.450
get them helicopters leave when in a blending it,
some Firebase,

1783
01:55:34.460 --> 01:55:38.480
I don't even know where it was.
We don't know if we're going back.

1784
01:55:38.481 --> 01:55:41.440
There's another SF team there.
We still got a lot of commandos.

1785
01:55:42.680 --> 01:55:45.840
So or like back in the game are we going to go,
um,

1786
01:55:46.650 --> 01:55:51.240
I linked up with the,
the,
the medical support that was there,

1787
01:55:51.360 --> 01:55:54.510
refit my bag,
got,
got everything ready to go again,

1788
01:55:55.260 --> 01:55:59.070
like we were going to go right back.
Um,
but we didn't,

1789
01:56:00.270 --> 01:56:04.740
uh,
which was probably the right call for that day.
Um,

1790
01:56:05.160 --> 01:56:07.290
so then we ended up going back to Jalalabad,

1791
01:56:07.291 --> 01:56:09.240
which is where we were operating out of at the time.

1792
01:56:11.220 --> 01:56:15.240
A couple of the ones you guys were there.
So we went and saw them.

1793
01:56:15.590 --> 01:56:18.830
A couple of the main guys were already a bog room.
Uh,

1794
01:56:19.830 --> 01:56:23.510
we took care of them.
We got a senior,

1795
01:56:24.830 --> 01:56:29.340
you know,
they'll see Guy Carl became our new acting team sergeant.
We

1796
01:56:30.840 --> 01:56:32.970
just went about better day.
I mean we still,

1797
01:56:33.150 --> 01:56:37.710
we still did another mission few weeks later.
Um,

1798
01:56:39.390 --> 01:56:43.350
it's just funny.
Remember?
So one of the,
one of the guys,

1799
01:56:43.351 --> 01:56:47.490
I'm damn plants,
he's now a sergeant major,
uh,

1800
01:56:48.120 --> 01:56:52.980
out there.
Um,
that was his,
his first mission with us.

1801
01:56:52.981 --> 01:56:56.940
And of course,
you know,
he's like,
are they all like this?

1802
01:56:56.941 --> 01:57:00.540
And of course they are.
Some of them are worse.

1803
01:57:03.230 --> 01:57:05.780
<v 5>Welcome aboard.
Yeah.
Everybody gets some.</v>

1804
01:57:07.430 --> 01:57:09.890
And then how much longer was that deployment you guys did?

1805
01:57:09.891 --> 01:57:12.820
A few more operations is with your new team sergeant,
you guys went up.

1806
01:57:12.840 --> 01:57:14.030
How did you feel going back out?

1807
01:57:14.920 --> 01:57:15.753
<v 4>Uh,</v>

1808
01:57:18.570 --> 01:57:21.510
obviously that at by was,

1809
01:57:22.430 --> 01:57:26.280
it was different than anything we'd faced before.
You have the,

1810
01:57:27.140 --> 01:57:30.930
when when we left,
whatever it was six weeks later.
That was,

1811
01:57:30.960 --> 01:57:34.980
that was my last comment.
Deployments or interface,
anything like that.
Again,

1812
01:57:34.981 --> 01:57:36.960
but it was,
well,
we went back out.
I mean,

1813
01:57:39.480 --> 01:57:44.460
we're ready to go again.
And I remember on that,

1814
01:57:44.550 --> 01:57:48.860
that next mission we went out on a,
yeah,

1815
01:57:49.020 --> 01:57:50.670
we're going through the village and

1816
01:57:52.410 --> 01:57:54.660
our interpreters are just,
yeah,

1817
01:57:55.440 --> 01:57:59.610
they would talk with the bad guys on walkie talkies sometimes and they just
talk,

1818
01:58:00.630 --> 01:58:05.370
talk shit back and forth to each other.
Um,
and so at one point they were like,
oh,

1819
01:58:05.371 --> 01:58:06.480
these were the guys that we just,

1820
01:58:06.820 --> 01:58:09.780
I think these are the guys we just messed up a few weeks ago.
Like,

1821
01:58:09.781 --> 01:58:10.810
let's get out of my hand.

1822
01:58:11.340 --> 01:58:16.050
Then a Kiowa came in and did a run and I took out a few and they were like,

1823
01:58:16.560 --> 01:58:20.330
second thought,
let's,
let's call today.
Uh,

1824
01:58:21.160 --> 01:58:23.850
I draw.
And now that was the end of that day.

1825
01:58:26.400 --> 01:58:30.680
But so,
oh yeah,
that'd be,
it was

1826
01:58:32.360 --> 01:58:37.280
definitely a day one.
Never forgotten.
But I'm just glad that,

1827
01:58:38.970 --> 01:58:42.910
you know,
the team came,
they got the job done.

1828
01:58:42.911 --> 01:58:46.630
We didn't accomplish the mission and we didn't find the bad guy.

1829
01:58:46.631 --> 01:58:51.450
We didn't get to bring him back.
But
yeah,

1830
01:58:51.470 --> 01:58:52.760
some days the win is,

1831
01:58:53.810 --> 01:58:58.810
it's just we got everybody that we could out of there alive.

1832
01:58:59.390 --> 01:59:00.230
And

1833
01:59:02.080 --> 01:59:04.730
<v 0>you know,
we certainly gave them worse than we got.</v>

1834
01:59:06.380 --> 01:59:11.210
Enemy killed was like 150 to 200.
And um,
and that,

1835
01:59:11.211 --> 01:59:11.870
that,

1836
01:59:11.870 --> 01:59:16.460
that ended up being the most decorations,

1837
01:59:16.700 --> 01:59:21.110
highest decorations handed out for a single day battle since the Vietnam War was

1838
01:59:21.111 --> 01:59:24.800
for this,
for this,
uh,
operation that you guys went on.

1839
01:59:26.480 --> 01:59:29.810
And then,
so when you came home,
what made you decide,

1840
01:59:29.840 --> 01:59:31.160
because you ended up getting out of the army,

1841
01:59:31.640 --> 01:59:32.900
what made you decide you were going to get out?

1842
01:59:33.600 --> 01:59:36.370
<v 4>I ended up getting out,
uh,
may of 2009,</v>

1843
01:59:36.460 --> 01:59:40.150
so just over a year later.
It was

1844
01:59:43.230 --> 01:59:47.700
a lot of different factors.
Uh,
like I said,
um,

1845
01:59:47.850 --> 01:59:48.683
my,

1846
01:59:48.930 --> 01:59:53.250
my older son was actually born in January of 2008 so I came home,

1847
01:59:53.330 --> 01:59:56.970
saw him born and then went right back to Afghanistan.
And then,
you know,

1848
01:59:57.020 --> 02:00:02.020
we had other missions in this mission a afterwards so that,

1849
02:00:03.390 --> 02:00:06.850
you know,
that priority,
uh,

1850
02:00:07.550 --> 02:00:10.610
factor starts to,
starts to go in there.
Um,

1851
02:00:11.750 --> 02:00:13.130
another part of it was just

1852
02:00:16.780 --> 02:00:17.290
<v 6>Gotcha.</v>

1853
02:00:17.290 --> 02:00:21.220
<v 4>Think I always felt like there was something I was supposed to do.</v>

1854
02:00:23.370 --> 02:00:24.203
<v 6>Okay.</v>

1855
02:00:24.500 --> 02:00:29.500
<v 4>And that seemed like as good a good a thing to check a block with is as I could,</v>

1856
02:00:30.970 --> 02:00:32.000
I could think of.
I don't know.

1857
02:00:32.260 --> 02:00:35.320
It's so many different factors that come in at like I,

1858
02:00:36.040 --> 02:00:41.040
there's not a day that goes by that I don't still miss the team is so wish

1859
02:00:41.800 --> 02:00:45.370
whenever I hear they're out there,
like I wish I was there with them.

1860
02:00:45.371 --> 02:00:49.180
I wish I was,
you know,
still doing it.

1861
02:00:49.181 --> 02:00:51.030
But you know,

1862
02:00:51.040 --> 02:00:54.910
I felt like I'd done whatever it was I was supposed to do.

1863
02:00:55.780 --> 02:00:58.650
And
I think,

1864
02:00:58.850 --> 02:01:03.250
I think it's tough for any special operations guys.
See,
oh,
a green baret ranger,

1865
02:01:03.740 --> 02:01:08.510
whatever.
At some point you have to hang it up because time is going to,

1866
02:01:08.620 --> 02:01:13.580
yeah,
it's a young man
if that game.

1867
02:01:13.581 --> 02:01:16.280
So
I felt like,

1868
02:01:17.360 --> 02:01:21.590
I mean I'll go out on God on my own terms and so to speak.
Yeah.

1869
02:01:21.990 --> 02:01:24.870
<v 0>And then how'd you end up getting into the secret service?
Like,
what,</v>

1870
02:01:24.871 --> 02:01:27.810
what made you look at that and think that seemed like a good call.

1871
02:01:30.280 --> 02:01:35.280
<v 4>So I think I started applying for them when I had about six months ago in,</v>

1872
02:01:37.571 --> 02:01:40.540
in the military and trust on,
uh Huh.

1873
02:01:41.150 --> 02:01:43.970
So full disclosure with them,

1874
02:01:43.971 --> 02:01:48.280
I federal law enforcement just seemed like a good,
uh,

1875
02:01:48.320 --> 02:01:52.490
next transition.
So I shotgun blast out,
you know,
the FBI,

1876
02:01:52.491 --> 02:01:54.320
the secret service that he,
Yay.

1877
02:01:54.980 --> 02:01:57.830
Marshall's air marshals everybody.

1878
02:01:57.980 --> 02:02:00.410
And very quickly on,

1879
02:02:00.411 --> 02:02:04.820
I really just liked the personality that came with the secret service,

1880
02:02:05.980 --> 02:02:08.690
the,
the attitude that the people had,

1881
02:02:08.810 --> 02:02:13.810
the dedication of the job though of the focus and a lot of ways,

1882
02:02:15.830 --> 02:02:19.390
you know,
like,
like SF,
like,
yeah,

1883
02:02:19.710 --> 02:02:23.740
you have super important mission.
Sometimes you have all the resources and needs,

1884
02:02:23.750 --> 02:02:26.570
sometimes you don't,
you're still gonna figure it out.
You're still gonna,

1885
02:02:27.050 --> 02:02:29.510
you're still gonna make it work on it.

1886
02:02:29.540 --> 02:02:33.020
I really liked that personality that came with it.
So

1887
02:02:35.190 --> 02:02:36.860
while everybody showed interest in me,
I,

1888
02:02:36.960 --> 02:02:41.760
I kind of focused there and end up getting hired with them a couple months after

1889
02:02:41.761 --> 02:02:43.020
I got got out of the army

1890
02:02:43.620 --> 02:02:44.221
<v 7>and then we'll all,</v>

1891
02:02:44.221 --> 02:02:48.270
it's what's that onboarding like you go through like a boot camp scenario with

1892
02:02:48.271 --> 02:02:52.830
them cause they must take kids out of college.
Right?
You're supposed to have,

1893
02:02:54.310 --> 02:02:55.540
<v 4>I can't remember what the book answer is,</v>

1894
02:02:55.541 --> 02:02:59.320
like three years of real world experience after college.
Sure.
Okay.

1895
02:02:59.590 --> 02:03:03.960
So hmm.
From my glass you had a mixture of,

1896
02:03:03.961 --> 02:03:05.940
some people had military backgrounds,

1897
02:03:05.941 --> 02:03:10.600
some people have law enforcement backgrounds,
some had,
one was a lawyer,

1898
02:03:11.170 --> 02:03:13.000
just any different background.

1899
02:03:13.570 --> 02:03:16.240
So is it like a gentleman's course boot camp scenario?

1900
02:03:21.260 --> 02:03:26.260
For the most part,
you know,
coming from,
from the SF background,

1901
02:03:26.280 --> 02:03:27.113
like

1902
02:03:28.150 --> 02:03:31.270
<v 7>I dunno who we need to kick out,
but you got to kick out somebody,
right.</v>

1903
02:03:32.110 --> 02:03:36.290
Just to make sure that everybody else who's here.
No,
it was like,
yeah,

1904
02:03:36.730 --> 02:03:39.730
it could happen to you,
but are we had a good class so everybody,

1905
02:03:39.790 --> 02:03:40.720
everybody got through.

1906
02:03:41.390 --> 02:03:44.390
<v 4>And,
uh,
but it was,</v>

1907
02:03:45.640 --> 02:03:49.400
I won't say he was about three months of training in Georgia at the federal law

1908
02:03:49.401 --> 02:03:50.660
enforcement training center.

1909
02:03:51.290 --> 02:03:55.220
Kinda basic information,

1910
02:03:55.700 --> 02:03:58.790
uh,
criminal investigator training programs and basically

1911
02:03:59.140 --> 02:04:02.440
<v 7>legal law stuff,
how to handle evidence,
all that kind of stuff.</v>

1912
02:04:02.590 --> 02:04:03.830
The basics every day,

1913
02:04:04.390 --> 02:04:05.680
<v 4>law enforcement person needs.</v>

1914
02:04:06.100 --> 02:04:09.760
And then you continue on with four more months at the secret service where you

1915
02:04:09.761 --> 02:04:14.560
learn the,
the two aspects of,
of our agency,

1916
02:04:14.561 --> 02:04:18.610
both the financial crimes investigations and the protection aspect.

1917
02:04:19.010 --> 02:04:19.131
<v 7>You're,</v>

1918
02:04:19.131 --> 02:04:22.160
most people don't know about the financial crimes investigation of the secret

1919
02:04:22.161 --> 02:04:23.840
service.
They don't think about that arm of it.

1920
02:04:24.210 --> 02:04:26.770
<v 4>Well,
and that's,
I mean,
that's why it was created a</v>

1921
02:04:28.290 --> 02:04:32.230
President Lincoln signed the secret service into,

1922
02:04:33.050 --> 02:04:36.900
into existence to fight counterfeiting because at the end of the civil,

1923
02:04:38.040 --> 02:04:39.780
but I can't remember the statistic,

1924
02:04:39.781 --> 02:04:43.710
like two thirds of the currency and the country was counterfeit.
Hmm.

1925
02:04:45.240 --> 02:04:49.080
You can't rebuild when half of everything is fake.

1926
02:04:50.010 --> 02:04:51.490
So he,
yeah,

1927
02:04:51.500 --> 02:04:55.750
he signed that and it was soon after that,
you know,

1928
02:04:55.751 --> 02:04:58.960
you went to a play,
didn't work out for him.
Um,

1929
02:04:59.460 --> 02:05:04.290
but then it was 40 years later that we kind of took over the fall time

1930
02:05:04.770 --> 02:05:08.290
protection of the president.
And of course,
that's our,

1931
02:05:08.520 --> 02:05:10.580
our main mission now.
Well,

1932
02:05:11.130 --> 02:05:13.740
while the majority of people in the agency are,

1933
02:05:14.190 --> 02:05:19.050
are out there keeping the financial system secure it intact,

1934
02:05:20.670 --> 02:05:25.320
obviously the number one mission is the president of the vice president,

1935
02:05:25.920 --> 02:05:30.630
um,
other heads of state or has government that come in to the country.

1936
02:05:30.631 --> 02:05:31.464
We protect them.

1937
02:05:33.740 --> 02:05:34.890
<v 6>Ben [inaudible]</v>

1938
02:05:35.440 --> 02:05:38.990
<v 4>mean obviously these are all no fail missions like you,</v>

1939
02:05:40.080 --> 02:05:42.080
Ken all let something happen to the president.

1940
02:05:42.320 --> 02:05:47.030
Or if you have some country come in that maybe nobody's,

1941
02:05:48.240 --> 02:05:50.360
you know,
nobody's ever heard of this dude.
Well,

1942
02:05:51.530 --> 02:05:56.030
we still can't let random street violence happen at this guy or,
or something.

1943
02:05:56.031 --> 02:06:00.320
So you just,
there's that whole spectrum that you have to work around.

1944
02:06:01.050 --> 02:06:03.300
<v 2>So you get done with the training.
And then where did you,
where was your,</v>

1945
02:06:03.301 --> 02:06:04.200
where did you get stationed?

1946
02:06:04.230 --> 02:06:07.590
Did you go to the president's detail or did you go to the crime fighting?

1947
02:06:08.230 --> 02:06:09.063
<v 6>Pardon?</v>

1948
02:06:09.200 --> 02:06:09.481
<v 4>So the,</v>

1949
02:06:09.481 --> 02:06:13.820
the typical career path is as you go out to one of the field officers around the

1950
02:06:13.821 --> 02:06:17.680
country and fight crime for a little while.
So when I got,

1951
02:06:18.100 --> 02:06:19.610
got the offer,

1952
02:06:20.360 --> 02:06:24.710
they offered me a couple of different studies to start in Phoenix,

1953
02:06:24.740 --> 02:06:26.380
Arizona sounded like the best option.

1954
02:06:27.820 --> 02:06:31.360
<v 6>So I took that.
Well yeah,</v>

1955
02:06:32.960 --> 02:06:37.040
<v 4>my wife and son moved out there right away.
We bought a house,</v>

1956
02:06:37.950 --> 02:06:39.410
you know,
while I technically live there,

1957
02:06:39.411 --> 02:06:42.170
I was off a training for several months and then uh,

1958
02:06:42.800 --> 02:06:44.660
join them as soon as I finished up.

1959
02:06:45.850 --> 02:06:47.770
<v 6>And I spent</v>

1960
02:06:48.080 --> 02:06:52.010
<v 4>basically the next four years in Phoenix from May,</v>

1961
02:06:52.010 --> 02:06:53.630
2010 to May,
2014

1962
02:06:55.940 --> 02:06:56.773
<v 6>hm.</v>

1963
02:06:57.000 --> 02:06:59.130
<v 4>Doing whatever financial crime or</v>

1964
02:07:00.570 --> 02:07:01.403
<v 2>includes what?</v>

1965
02:07:01.980 --> 02:07:05.640
<v 4>Yeah,
yeah.
Your credit card fraud.
You're counterfeiting.</v>

1966
02:07:06.320 --> 02:07:07.210
<v 2>Did he get your number?</v>

1967
02:07:07.220 --> 02:07:12.220
Because credit card fraud people are all about common after me as like open

1968
02:07:14.141 --> 02:07:17.080
access.
I think that's what,
and,
and when I talk to people like yeah,
that happens.

1969
02:07:17.081 --> 02:07:20.400
It's happened to everyone.
That's like the main crime right now.
When I say,
Hey,

1970
02:07:20.670 --> 02:07:21.890
that there's credit card fraud of me,

1971
02:07:21.940 --> 02:07:24.010
does he all that happened to me two weeks ago.
It's happening to everyone.

1972
02:07:24.390 --> 02:07:27.300
<v 4>It yeah,
it's happened to me.
Um,
yeah.</v>

1973
02:07:27.840 --> 02:07:32.840
<v 2>Dang.
Okay.
Maybe I won't call you.
It's,
it's one of those things.</v>

1974
02:07:32.841 --> 02:07:33.520
I mean there's so many

1975
02:07:33.520 --> 02:07:38.320
<v 4>different low levels too.
I like you can,</v>

1976
02:07:39.190 --> 02:07:42.850
you know,
there's the,
the prudence,
the,
you know,
you'll see,

1977
02:07:42.851 --> 02:07:43.541
you'll see the thing is like,

1978
02:07:43.541 --> 02:07:47.680
oh check a ATM to see if you see a skimmer attached to it,

1979
02:07:48.520 --> 02:07:50.860
which is great advice.
It's definitely something,
you know,

1980
02:07:50.980 --> 02:07:53.680
something looks weird on ATM,
Joe Use it.

1981
02:07:54.370 --> 02:07:59.370
But you go to a store and I mean even like target or these bigger stores.

1982
02:08:00.040 --> 02:08:02.860
Oh yeah,
that's right.
They had the massive,
you get hacked.

1983
02:08:04.720 --> 02:08:07.480
You didn't do anything wrong.
Like you use the machine,

1984
02:08:07.481 --> 02:08:10.840
the machine was a secure your thought,
but at some back level.

1985
02:08:10.841 --> 02:08:15.130
So there's those two aspects of the crime that we energies now.

1986
02:08:15.131 --> 02:08:18.910
Cause there's the person who stole all the,
the card information,

1987
02:08:19.330 --> 02:08:22.960
but they're almost never the person who's using you say they sell it to somebody

1988
02:08:22.961 --> 02:08:27.800
else.
So you,
you get to pick which side do I want to chase today?

1989
02:08:27.801 --> 02:08:30.130
I don't want to figure out who stole it your own and figure out who's using it

1990
02:08:30.790 --> 02:08:33.520
and
kept me pretty busy.

1991
02:08:34.240 --> 02:08:38.080
And then eventually you get called back to DC.

1992
02:08:38.230 --> 02:08:42.820
Is that where you got stationed next?
Uh,
so I'm stationed in DC now.
Um,
um,

1993
02:08:43.150 --> 02:08:47.310
with the counter salt team for the secret service,
it's okay.

1994
02:08:47.620 --> 02:08:51.310
<v 7>Which is like the cool,
like the coolest job,
right?
I mean in the secret service,</v>

1995
02:08:51.730 --> 02:08:52.900
let's be straight up,
right?

1996
02:08:53.440 --> 02:08:56.500
There's nothing cooler than saying I'm on the counter assault team of the secret

1997
02:08:56.501 --> 02:08:58.680
service.
It does sound cool.
Yes.

1998
02:08:59.090 --> 02:09:01.840
And what it really means is sitting in the back of the vehicle somewhere for

1999
02:09:01.841 --> 02:09:04.720
long periods of time in a motorcade or something.
Yeah.

2000
02:09:04.721 --> 02:09:07.270
With the full body armor on.
Yeah.
Thanks.
So you're uncomfortable,

2001
02:09:07.271 --> 02:09:11.350
you're miserable complaining about it.
Like why did I sign up for this?

2002
02:09:11.351 --> 02:09:14.300
But then there's like 8,000,
uh,

2003
02:09:15.100 --> 02:09:19.090
pieces of security that someone would have to overcome for you guys to get the

2004
02:09:19.091 --> 02:09:23.590
call.
But someday,
and it does sound cool.
So we got that going for us.

2005
02:09:23.830 --> 02:09:26.870
But what I,
what I loved about that,
just like with Sfo,

2006
02:09:27.980 --> 02:09:30.390
<v 4>you know,
to be there,
you have to,
you have to volunteer,</v>

2007
02:09:30.391 --> 02:09:33.000
you have to go through a selection process.
You got to go through another school.

2008
02:09:33.390 --> 02:09:38.070
We washed out between selection and the school itself wash out about half,

2009
02:09:38.071 --> 02:09:38.770
maybe a little more.

2010
02:09:38.770 --> 02:09:41.380
<v 7>How tight are they on,
are they on shooting in that school?</v>

2011
02:09:42.520 --> 02:09:46.490
<v 4>Uh,
standards are much higher than the general secret service</v>

2012
02:09:47.000 --> 02:09:50.960
<v 7>cause you might be taking shots around the president just don't want to throw</v>

2013
02:09:50.961 --> 02:09:55.040
that round.
No pressure.
Yeah.

2014
02:09:55.041 --> 02:09:58.610
It adds a little extra level to the,
you know,
law enforcement,

2015
02:09:58.850 --> 02:10:02.870
every round counts aspects of the military,
you know,

2016
02:10:03.570 --> 02:10:08.330
most,
most,
most,
most around scalp.
You can't just fire indiscriminately.

2017
02:10:08.331 --> 02:10:11.710
But you know,
if he is generally in that area,

2018
02:10:12.110 --> 02:10:15.350
that's why they gave him the more than one bullet.
Um,
whereas,
you know,

2019
02:10:15.351 --> 02:10:18.290
the secret service.
Yeah.
I got,
I got in trouble one time during,

2020
02:10:18.590 --> 02:10:22.760
during CQC trading for putting down cover fire in a building here.
I was like,

2021
02:10:22.761 --> 02:10:24.770
you know,
someone was trying to cross the hallway and I'm like,
okay,

2022
02:10:24.771 --> 02:10:28.190
I know there's a baguette.
Other hamsters are shooting at him and um,
you know,

2023
02:10:28.191 --> 02:10:32.960
the instructor is like Chaco w w w what were you doing over here?
And I was like,

2024
02:10:33.260 --> 02:10:34.070
and he's like,
in this,
you

2025
02:10:34.070 --> 02:10:36.080
<v 2>know,
you're holding this hallway and then you just started shooting.</v>

2026
02:10:36.110 --> 02:10:38.440
And I was like,
I was putting down cover fire for the guy that was moving.

2027
02:10:38.450 --> 02:10:43.280
He goes,
he's like,
I get it,
but you're really not supposed to do that in CQC.

2028
02:10:43.281 --> 02:10:46.100
And I'm like,
okay,
fair enough.
You know,
but if the guy,
because

2029
02:10:48.110 --> 02:10:51.380
he wasn't coming around the corner when I was cracking rounds out of it.
Exactly.

2030
02:10:52.160 --> 02:10:55.340
So you're so you,
and so you're just,
that's,
do you go on,

2031
02:10:55.400 --> 02:10:57.440
is there a rotation that you're going on for that?

2032
02:10:57.450 --> 02:11:00.410
Are you like all in all the time?
Pretty three months on,
three months off?

2033
02:11:00.411 --> 02:11:03.380
Do you just,
are you just in a certain area and that's when you're live?

2034
02:11:05.080 --> 02:11:07.450
<v 4>So,
uh,
they break us down into,</v>

2035
02:11:08.630 --> 02:11:13.090
we call them,
we have teams and then two teams make up a company and then,

2036
02:11:13.600 --> 02:11:17.170
and then so we have basically four different elements.

2037
02:11:17.171 --> 02:11:21.050
So one's on training ones on uh,
your days ones when you're eating in,

2038
02:11:21.060 --> 02:11:25.210
one's on your ear meds had Alzheimer's.
And so yeah,
your,

2039
02:11:25.211 --> 02:11:29.320
your downtime is to train and then the rest of the time you're up protecting,

2040
02:11:30.230 --> 02:11:33.430
played in the man or you know,
president,
vice president,

2041
02:11:34.390 --> 02:11:37.990
other people as,
as needed support,

2042
02:11:39.150 --> 02:11:39.983
just always working.

2043
02:11:40.890 --> 02:11:44.730
<v 2>And at some point during,
during that job,</v>

2044
02:11:45.710 --> 02:11:46.950
you,
you got you,

2045
02:11:46.980 --> 02:11:50.400
you went to the hospital and figured out something that wasn't going too well.

2046
02:11:51.390 --> 02:11:55.020
<v 4>I,
I'd say at least.
Um,
so you know,</v>

2047
02:11:55.500 --> 02:12:00.210
if you kind of go through the low,
the full story,
um,

2048
02:12:01.370 --> 02:12:03.320
what was that?
Late spring,

2049
02:12:03.380 --> 02:12:06.440
early summer of 2016,

2050
02:12:06.441 --> 02:12:10.840
I kind of started getting a little pain in my,
my right hip,
um,

2051
02:12:10.940 --> 02:12:12.050
a little pain in my back,

2052
02:12:12.170 --> 02:12:17.170
but of course I have some pain and I was running around the kit for the army for

2053
02:12:18.470 --> 02:12:22.280
six and a half years.
You know,
at that point,

2054
02:12:22.281 --> 02:12:27.080
I've been doing it with the account assaulting him for two and a half years.
Uh,

2055
02:12:27.670 --> 02:12:32.420
just,
you know,
you're not supposed to do that to your body.
It's not,

2056
02:12:32.840 --> 02:12:36.170
it's not good for you.
Everybody knows it.
Uh,

2057
02:12:36.680 --> 02:12:41.660
so I was actually in California hiking with the Obama family,

2058
02:12:42.430 --> 02:12:46.520
uh,
in your summary,
doing a father's day weekend trip with them.

2059
02:12:46.521 --> 02:12:49.400
And Yeah,
my hip was hurting,

2060
02:12:49.401 --> 02:12:54.140
my back kind of seized up and I are,
this is,
this is not right,

2061
02:12:54.141 --> 02:12:57.590
but I go see my doc and he's like,
I'm just stretch some more

2062
02:12:59.570 --> 02:13:02.120
or stop doing your,
your job.
I'm like,
well,

2063
02:13:02.210 --> 02:13:05.420
I'm not going to stop so I'm going to stretch some more

2064
02:13:07.370 --> 02:13:11.450
pain.
All kinds of guy kept getting a little worse little,
you know,

2065
02:13:11.500 --> 02:13:14.810
just a little more knowing as,
as a went

2066
02:13:16.430 --> 02:13:19.430
since the doctor to give me a good answer.
Let me try.

2067
02:13:19.431 --> 02:13:23.330
A chiropractor got some relief for a little while from that and it,

2068
02:13:23.331 --> 02:13:26.990
but it just kept getting,
getting a little bit worse.
And so

2069
02:13:28.790 --> 02:13:31.020
he came up with the,
the,
uh,

2070
02:13:32.460 --> 02:13:35.550
differential diagnosis to use or medical terms that he was like,

2071
02:13:35.551 --> 02:13:39.510
you probably tore some cartilage in your hip at some point.
And I was like,

2072
02:13:39.511 --> 02:13:43.470
I don't remember doing that.
And he's like,
well,
as active as you are,

2073
02:13:43.471 --> 02:13:45.060
I can just happen sometimes.

2074
02:13:46.010 --> 02:13:51.010
So we do an MRI in February of 2017 and then then next day waiting on results

2075
02:13:53.761 --> 02:13:56.580
and still fly out to,
I actually flew out to San Diego to do,

2076
02:13:57.720 --> 02:14:02.070
to do some more work.
And that afternoon after I got here,

2077
02:14:02.280 --> 02:14:05.400
he called the news,
you know,
telling us,
well,

2078
02:14:07.690 --> 02:14:11.580
uh,
a few different,
um,

2079
02:14:12.230 --> 02:14:14.400
he used the word lesions.
You didn't want to say tumors.
What?
He's like,

2080
02:14:14.401 --> 02:14:18.300
he got a few things going on in your hip that are not normal.

2081
02:14:18.301 --> 02:14:23.301
I need you to go talk to this doc like as soon as you can.

2082
02:14:23.621 --> 02:14:27.750
And
he did into,
didn't even tell me like what the,

2083
02:14:28.500 --> 02:14:32.640
what that doc did,
but like,
okay,
he's at this hospital,
he's this dog.

2084
02:14:32.641 --> 02:14:37.000
I Google him like anybody wanted.
I'm like,
oh,
he's an oncologist.
Like,

2085
02:14:37.020 --> 02:14:41.490
so this like,
of course that calls bad,
but you know,

2086
02:14:41.491 --> 02:14:45.900
now we're getting more information.
Okay.
I said,
really not good.
Uh,

2087
02:14:46.070 --> 02:14:51.070
I took the red eye back home and next day get a cat scan and that's when they

2088
02:14:51.211 --> 02:14:55.860
find a tumor is just everywhere.
Uh,

2089
02:14:56.640 --> 02:15:00.510
what they decided was the primary tumor is about the size of a little bigger

2090
02:15:00.511 --> 02:15:03.420
than a baseball and my left lung.
Um,

2091
02:15:05.460 --> 02:15:07.440
and by that point,
like I started thinking like

2092
02:15:09.270 --> 02:15:12.510
with all the work that I've been doing,
like I'm just getting out of shape,

2093
02:15:12.660 --> 02:15:14.490
like my runtimes keep you in a little worse.

2094
02:15:14.491 --> 02:15:19.080
But at no point did I think that's what it was.

2095
02:15:19.650 --> 02:15:23.100
Um,
so we find out like through that Mri,
like I'd actually,

2096
02:15:23.160 --> 02:15:27.030
I had a fracture on my pelvis,
um,

2097
02:15:28.080 --> 02:15:31.710
Jad baseball on my lung and a fraction of my pelvis

2098
02:15:33.580 --> 02:15:34.413
still working.

2099
02:15:37.140 --> 02:15:39.030
So yeah,

2100
02:15:39.031 --> 02:15:42.870
we go through the process of trying to figure out what's going on,

2101
02:15:43.330 --> 02:15:46.260
find a doc,
don't really care for him,
fire him,

2102
02:15:47.160 --> 02:15:50.250
go find another doc at Johns Hopkins were really black.

2103
02:15:50.251 --> 02:15:52.850
We're still working with him.
Uh,

2104
02:15:54.450 --> 02:15:57.690
and we've been fighting for just over two years now.

2105
02:15:59.670 --> 02:16:04.470
<v 5>And then on top of that,
you're,
you're,</v>

2106
02:16:05.310 --> 02:16:08.020
well as I mentioned,
you guys,
your um,

2107
02:16:08.160 --> 02:16:11.490
Oda team got something like,
I don't know,

2108
02:16:11.491 --> 02:16:16.491
12 or 13 silver stars amongst them because 10 zero stars,

2109
02:16:17.160 --> 02:16:21.360
three or four bronze though the air force cross for this cross.

2110
02:16:22.470 --> 02:16:25.480
And you are one of those,
you are one of those silver stars.
Yeah.

2111
02:16:25.490 --> 02:16:30.220
So miles and they the the government or,
yeah,
the military.

2112
02:16:31.060 --> 02:16:31.900
<v 0>Basically,</v>

2113
02:16:32.160 --> 02:16:36.370
I forget what year is maybe 2015 or 16,

2114
02:16:36.371 --> 02:16:38.240
they started doing a,
uh,

2115
02:16:38.500 --> 02:16:43.500
a service wide review of all of the awards that had been handed out or awarded

2116
02:16:46.720 --> 02:16:51.720
to see if they all all kind of matched up and w w were where they should be.

2117
02:16:53.890 --> 02:16:55.600
And I know actually

2118
02:16:57.310 --> 02:17:02.310
three of my guys who had been written up for bronze stars,

2119
02:17:02.441 --> 02:17:02.920
they got,

2120
02:17:02.920 --> 02:17:07.690
they got advanced or they got a raised two silver stars,

2121
02:17:07.990 --> 02:17:12.910
but they reviewed year award as well.
And um,

2122
02:17:13.330 --> 02:17:16.060
they came to a conclusion that it should be upgraded.

2123
02:17:16.061 --> 02:17:17.220
And how'd you find out about that?

2124
02:17:18.580 --> 02:17:19.413
<v 4>So</v>

2125
02:17:21.610 --> 02:17:25.390
I of course had heard about the review process that the secretary of defense had

2126
02:17:25.391 --> 02:17:28.510
ordered.
Never gave it a second thought,

2127
02:17:29.080 --> 02:17:33.220
just went on about my,
my uh,
day to day life.

2128
02:17:34.920 --> 02:17:38.560
I mean,
honestly I think like most soft guys,

2129
02:17:38.561 --> 02:17:42.970
like just a attaboy and here's your next mission.

2130
02:17:43.450 --> 02:17:47.500
That's all any of them expect or want or or anything.

2131
02:17:47.501 --> 02:17:50.710
So in uh,

2132
02:17:50.711 --> 02:17:55.210
August of last year I get the first call on,

2133
02:17:55.420 --> 02:17:58.420
on my own phone because you know,

2134
02:17:58.510 --> 02:18:01.540
you still have that as part of that triple play package.
You know,

2135
02:18:01.541 --> 02:18:03.870
they get you with the home phone.
Like I don't want a home phone there.

2136
02:18:03.890 --> 02:18:07.630
Like it costs more than not have it.
Like the landline.
Yeah.

2137
02:18:10.450 --> 02:18:13.120
Yeah.
So somebody,
somebody calls,
they left,

2138
02:18:13.630 --> 02:18:18.630
they left a voicemail on that is it is even call a voicemail when it's on the

2139
02:18:19.390 --> 02:18:21.700
answering machine,
the answering,
I don't know.

2140
02:18:22.870 --> 02:18:26.440
But they called and left a message and they claimed that they were from the

2141
02:18:26.441 --> 02:18:31.330
Pentagon and they,
they said we needed to talk to Ron Shirt.

2142
02:18:31.900 --> 02:18:35.320
And I was like,
this is,
it almost sounds legit,

2143
02:18:35.350 --> 02:18:36.910
but it's definitely a scam.

2144
02:18:37.210 --> 02:18:41.650
I'll call him back and just speaking of credit card fraud,

2145
02:18:41.651 --> 02:18:44.920
here we go.
So I call him up and they're like,

2146
02:18:44.921 --> 02:18:48.790
we need to set up a call between you and a higher ranking dod official.

2147
02:18:49.530 --> 02:18:53.500
And so I'm like,
Woo Hoo.
Now like we can't tell you.
I'm like,

2148
02:18:53.501 --> 02:18:55.810
why we can't tell ya?
I'm like,

2149
02:18:56.050 --> 02:18:59.200
well that doesn't sound right.
So

2150
02:18:59.340 --> 02:19:00.173
<v 1>okay,</v>

2151
02:19:00.850 --> 02:19:05.850
<v 4>go to send me an email from your official.dot mil to my secret service email.</v>

2152
02:19:09.730 --> 02:19:12.850
Launch it over there.
We'll just,

2153
02:19:12.910 --> 02:19:16.720
just to verify who you are cause you say you're from their army here at the

2154
02:19:16.721 --> 02:19:20.610
Pentagon.
I get calls from them all the time.
Dry.

2155
02:19:21.750 --> 02:19:25.590
Yeah.
Irs is always calling me saying I'm about to be arrested.
Right.

2156
02:19:28.020 --> 02:19:28.853
I used to,

2157
02:19:29.020 --> 02:19:34.020
they sent me that message confirming who they were and so I,

2158
02:19:35.130 --> 02:19:39.020
I'm just not going to tell me why.
And they're like,
no.
I'm like,
well that's cool.

2159
02:19:39.021 --> 02:19:41.270
I got a family vacation I'm taking next week.

2160
02:19:42.680 --> 02:19:46.820
Have this person called me after that.
Um,

2161
02:19:47.420 --> 02:19:50.480
but like I had mentioned where we're in this

2162
02:19:52.430 --> 02:19:55.040
cancer battle.
And so just before we went on that trip,

2163
02:19:55.340 --> 02:19:59.060
I started getting some new pain.
So we do some scans,

2164
02:19:59.061 --> 02:20:02.270
we find out I got a little bit and a little bit of stuff growing when we make a

2165
02:20:02.271 --> 02:20:04.490
plan to deal with that as soon as we get back from our trip.

2166
02:20:05.720 --> 02:20:08.690
So I go on my family vacation,

2167
02:20:09.380 --> 02:20:14.150
we come back and we start radiation basically.

2168
02:20:14.151 --> 02:20:17.210
Then the next day just trying to get control again.

2169
02:20:18.560 --> 02:20:23.500
So this person,
the army,
they start calling me again.

2170
02:20:23.501 --> 02:20:27.710
I'm like,
Hey,
we're going to set up a date for this person to talk to you.

2171
02:20:28.740 --> 02:20:33.650
And it's like,
okay,
cool.
You have any idea right now?
Or are you just now we,

2172
02:20:33.651 --> 02:20:38.651
my wife and I were trying to like brainstorm like I knew about the review

2173
02:20:40.821 --> 02:20:43.400
process.
Did that even click in your head?

2174
02:20:43.550 --> 02:20:46.910
I think at one point.
So

2175
02:20:48.440 --> 02:20:52.430
with the,
the email,
like the,

2176
02:20:53.840 --> 02:20:55.610
the not substitute,

2177
02:20:55.611 --> 02:20:59.370
but I like your name and then this is my job is how important I am.
Blah,

2178
02:20:59.530 --> 02:21:02.680
the same as your line.
Uh,

2179
02:21:03.080 --> 02:21:05.570
I see that and I see,
see what it is.

2180
02:21:05.571 --> 02:21:10.060
So I Google that because I don't know who this person is or what it is just to

2181
02:21:10.070 --> 02:21:10.903
get her.

2182
02:21:11.210 --> 02:21:15.570
So I started going down that chain and at one point we actually found out that

2183
02:21:15.571 --> 02:21:20.000
it there in the long process of the medal of honor.

2184
02:21:20.910 --> 02:21:22.610
They're one of the many tears,

2185
02:21:23.240 --> 02:21:25.870
but my wife and I kind of look at each other and you know,

2186
02:21:26.000 --> 02:21:29.660
just kinda chocolate off.
Like that's ridiculous.
Uh,

2187
02:21:31.240 --> 02:21:33.770
but so we're like,
well,
maybe,

2188
02:21:35.120 --> 02:21:39.740
maybe you're a witness for somebody.
I got a witness for something.

2189
02:21:39.741 --> 02:21:44.570
I signed up for the,
you know,
the burn pit registry that's out there.

2190
02:21:44.571 --> 02:21:46.460
Like,
we'll sign up for that.
I'll,

2191
02:21:46.940 --> 02:21:51.680
maybe it's something to do with any of these numerous things.
So,

2192
02:21:52.750 --> 02:21:56.630
uh,
the day that I'm supposed to get the call,
oh,

2193
02:21:57.690 --> 02:22:02.690
teleworking in that day because my just finished up some radiation feel awful.

2194
02:22:03.950 --> 02:22:05.960
And so,
um,

2195
02:22:06.830 --> 02:22:10.160
I get the first call from the military saying,

2196
02:22:10.161 --> 02:22:13.580
are you going to take your call later today?
I'm like,
yes,
I'm good.

2197
02:22:15.170 --> 02:22:16.003
Then

2198
02:22:17.390 --> 02:22:22.390
one of my friends ends up calling Miranda and it says basically standby for

2199
02:22:24.291 --> 02:22:28.730
Ron's boss.
And so he gets on the line to talk to Miranda and he's like,

2200
02:22:28.731 --> 02:22:32.550
it's Ron good for a phone call today.
And she's like,
yes,

2201
02:22:32.580 --> 02:22:34.410
Ron's fine for a call.

2202
02:22:34.411 --> 02:22:38.520
Is this the call that we've been talking to other people about it?
And he's like,

2203
02:22:38.521 --> 02:22:43.290
yeah,
you like,
why are you calling?
And we,
we just can't process.

2204
02:22:43.440 --> 02:22:47.730
Like why is he now calling us?
So he's like,

2205
02:22:47.731 --> 02:22:49.380
are you good for your call?
Like yeah,
we're good for our call.

2206
02:22:49.381 --> 02:22:52.620
The army calls me back again.
You good for your call?
And like,
yes,

2207
02:22:52.621 --> 02:22:54.660
I'm still good for my call.

2208
02:22:54.661 --> 02:22:58.950
I'm going to run out of battery though if you people keep calling me the check

2209
02:22:58.951 --> 02:23:00.960
of my good for my,
my call or not.

2210
02:23:02.820 --> 02:23:05.970
So a little while later I boss calls back again and he's like,

2211
02:23:05.971 --> 02:23:08.190
your call is canceled.
Like,

2212
02:23:09.480 --> 02:23:12.630
why are you canceling my call?
And

2213
02:23:14.340 --> 02:23:17.830
you know,
just trying to run through all the scenarios in your head.
Like,
Whoa,

2214
02:23:17.870 --> 02:23:21.870
why are you doing anything with this?
And he's like,
trust me,
it's good.

2215
02:23:21.900 --> 02:23:25.020
And it was like,
I don't trust you

2216
02:23:27.090 --> 02:23:31.680
but,
but okay,
I have no choice in this matter.

2217
02:23:31.681 --> 02:23:34.890
So he ends up calling and he's saying,

2218
02:23:34.891 --> 02:23:39.240
next Tuesday I need you to come into the White House with,

2219
02:23:39.360 --> 02:23:44.360
with Miranda and you need to talk to the boss of the president's detail.

2220
02:23:46.860 --> 02:23:51.860
That makes even less sense than anything that's been happening so far.

2221
02:23:54.420 --> 02:23:59.400
So,
uh,
Tuesday it's September 4th,
um,
we end up,

2222
02:24:00.150 --> 02:24:02.460
he comes by,
our house,
gets asked,

2223
02:24:02.461 --> 02:24:05.840
brings us in into the,

2224
02:24:06.200 --> 02:24:10.770
the White House complex and we go over and we start in the boss of the

2225
02:24:10.771 --> 02:24:12.540
president's detail.

2226
02:24:12.541 --> 02:24:16.740
We started off in his office and so he meets us in there.
He's like,
you know,

2227
02:24:16.770 --> 02:24:21.590
hi Rhonda Miranda,
thanks for coming in.
Really appreciate it.
Um,

2228
02:24:22.890 --> 02:24:25.440
John Kelly wants to talk to you guys.

2229
02:24:26.790 --> 02:24:30.450
So of course Miranda and I are kind of looking at each other like trying to do

2230
02:24:30.451 --> 02:24:34.920
like has,
he knows like,
and kind of what we're,
where are we,

2231
02:24:35.670 --> 02:24:40.110
we landed is like,
okay,
I think I'm going to get upgraded to a cross,

2232
02:24:40.830 --> 02:24:45.660
which is an amazing honor,
I think.
And I think the secret service found out,

2233
02:24:46.620 --> 02:24:50.370
and since John Kelly,
the chief of staff at the time,
you know,

2234
02:24:50.610 --> 02:24:54.390
former general,
we had that connection,

2235
02:24:54.850 --> 02:24:57.990
like he's got to,
he didn't bring me a gel me.

2236
02:24:59.340 --> 02:25:04.140
So we spend some time in the boss's office and they bring us into the waiting

2237
02:25:04.141 --> 02:25:06.510
room and in the west wing itself.

2238
02:25:07.380 --> 02:25:12.070
And so we're sitting there just continuing to wait.
And then,
uh,

2239
02:25:13.290 --> 02:25:16.290
John Kelly comes by and he's like,
Hey Ron.
Hey Miranda,

2240
02:25:16.680 --> 02:25:19.410
thanks so much for coming in.
I just want to talk with you guys for a little bit.

2241
02:25:21.000 --> 02:25:23.250
And so he's like,
follow me back to my office.

2242
02:25:23.380 --> 02:25:26.350
So we start following inquiries.

2243
02:25:28.180 --> 02:25:29.800
So we started following him down.

2244
02:25:31.150 --> 02:25:36.010
Miranda doesn't know the White House,
so she's just tagging along.

2245
02:25:36.011 --> 02:25:40.240
Like we're walking down the hallway and I think,
think we pass,

2246
02:25:42.630 --> 02:25:47.620
uh,
Sarah Huckabee's office and she's like,
oh look,
she's just,
you know,

2247
02:25:47.700 --> 02:25:52.120
going to be kind of star struck by the,
by the office and all the things.

2248
02:25:52.121 --> 02:25:55.660
But in my mind I'm like,
you know,

2249
02:25:55.661 --> 02:26:00.310
I don't want to interrupt the chief of staff to the president,
but I'm like,
sir,

2250
02:26:00.311 --> 02:26:05.080
your office is,
is that way?
Like,
do you know where you work?

2251
02:26:06.450 --> 02:26:09.700
Uh,
but I'm just along for the ride.

2252
02:26:10.420 --> 02:26:12.090
So we walked down the hall,

2253
02:26:12.100 --> 02:26:17.100
we make a couple turns and then he makes that left into what I know is the Ole,

2254
02:26:18.640 --> 02:26:20.370
and so I get to that threshold.

2255
02:26:20.371 --> 02:26:25.060
I see the president sitting at his desk and as soon as I hit that threshold,

2256
02:26:25.061 --> 02:26:27.040
I can see there's cameras.

2257
02:26:27.430 --> 02:26:31.360
So the video and you're just still camera is just going crazy,
just white house,

2258
02:26:31.361 --> 02:26:35.260
internal stuff,
just clicking away.
And at that point it was definitely like,

2259
02:26:37.030 --> 02:26:40.200
oh shit,
this,

2260
02:26:40.270 --> 02:26:43.950
the Naco today gone and got out of hand.
Uh,

2261
02:26:44.860 --> 02:26:48.130
so the president gets up,
he shakes her hand.
You know,

2262
02:26:48.131 --> 02:26:51.940
you did not expect to see me today.
Did you know it wasn't,

2263
02:26:52.320 --> 02:26:54.430
I wasn't planning on it.
Uh,

2264
02:26:56.290 --> 02:26:58.750
I honestly can't remember everything.
You know,

2265
02:26:58.751 --> 02:27:02.740
just the usual platitudes.
Thanks for your service.

2266
02:27:02.740 --> 02:27:06.520
I heard you were in Afghanistan,
like,
yeah.
And he's like,

2267
02:27:06.820 --> 02:27:11.050
did you know you're getting looked at for Afghanistan?
And like,
no.

2268
02:27:11.620 --> 02:27:12.453
He's like,
well,

2269
02:27:12.850 --> 02:27:16.570
just want you to know I just approved you to get the congressional medal of

2270
02:27:16.571 --> 02:27:21.340
honor.
And honestly at that point it all just kind of went to white noise.

2271
02:27:21.520 --> 02:27:25.780
I couldn't,
I don't know what else he said afterwards.
Um,

2272
02:27:26.680 --> 02:27:29.530
we have the pictures and you can,

2273
02:27:29.590 --> 02:27:31.720
you can flip through and you can see the moment where he tells,

2274
02:27:31.721 --> 02:27:36.580
cause I have a definite what the are you saying?

2275
02:27:37.060 --> 02:27:41.650
And my wife is starting kind of that happy,
happy cry.
Um,

2276
02:27:42.580 --> 02:27:45.910
but yeah,
so we had had no,

2277
02:27:47.050 --> 02:27:48.640
no idea that it was getting,

2278
02:27:49.710 --> 02:27:51.640
I mean I knew generally that things were getting looked at,

2279
02:27:51.641 --> 02:27:55.330
but I'm no idea that my packet would stand out or not stand out or,

2280
02:27:56.380 --> 02:28:00.610
or anything.
Um,
yeah,
we,
we got out of there the,

2281
02:28:01.830 --> 02:28:06.040
the,
the boss that had
basically

2282
02:28:07.540 --> 02:28:10.900
found out it was,
you know,
government efficiencies.

2283
02:28:11.320 --> 02:28:12.880
Like that day I was supposed to get the call,

2284
02:28:12.881 --> 02:28:15.220
they kind of went down the hall and like,
does this guy work for you?

2285
02:28:16.730 --> 02:28:20.980
I've been emailing you from a secret service email address for weeks now.

2286
02:28:21.790 --> 02:28:24.380
Uh,
but so it was at that moment,
they're like,
does he work for you?

2287
02:28:24.381 --> 02:28:28.210
And they're like,
yeah,
he works for us.
And he's here in DC and he,
oh,

2288
02:28:28.660 --> 02:28:31.040
he has a White House pass,
he can walk in a little White House.
And it's,
I mean,

2289
02:28:31.050 --> 02:28:33.200
once,
uh,
so,

2290
02:28:35.210 --> 02:28:36.770
so they coordinated that.

2291
02:28:36.771 --> 02:28:41.210
They made sure the counter assault team for that day,
they were all,

2292
02:28:42.140 --> 02:28:46.370
uh,
you know,
marine,
a green baret some more army.

2293
02:28:46.380 --> 02:28:50.540
And when the Marina,
just all army guys who all kind of got it.

2294
02:28:50.541 --> 02:28:52.220
And then they found out,
like

2295
02:28:54.590 --> 02:28:59.590
as I was finding out and so went and saw them and he had the whole,

2296
02:29:00.350 --> 02:29:05.000
whole thing was just super surreal trying to
figure out why me,

2297
02:29:05.001 --> 02:29:08.330
why,
why not?
Why any of it.
Um,

2298
02:29:10.010 --> 02:29:13.490
I remember it was soon after that,
the,

2299
02:29:14.750 --> 02:29:18.380
the,
uh,
the crawl from depending on,
she called,
she's like,

2300
02:29:18.410 --> 02:29:22.110
so you've obviously not talked to him,
you know,
you,

2301
02:29:22.150 --> 02:29:25.310
you know why we were being secretive now.
And I'm like,
yeah.

2302
02:29:25.311 --> 02:29:27.860
And then she said a lot of stuff about like,

2303
02:29:29.590 --> 02:29:32.200
you know how the process is going to work and other things.

2304
02:29:32.910 --> 02:29:35.860
And at the end of it,
it got to the point I was like,
ma'am,

2305
02:29:35.861 --> 02:29:37.840
I don't remember a thing you just said,

2306
02:29:39.250 --> 02:29:41.350
but I don't have a uniform.

2307
02:29:41.351 --> 02:29:45.520
And like I don't know why that out for seven,
eight,

2308
02:29:45.790 --> 02:29:48.430
nine years or something,
make them age thousand nine is when I got out.

2309
02:29:48.431 --> 02:29:52.360
So this is me.
That's nine and a half years.

2310
02:29:53.980 --> 02:29:56.680
Yeah,
next month will be 10.
So that was nine and a half years since I got out.

2311
02:29:59.280 --> 02:30:03.780
So yeah,
it was the last thing that I thought was,
was coming at me.

2312
02:30:03.781 --> 02:30:08.520
I'm obviously
super humbled by,
by it,

2313
02:30:08.521 --> 02:30:11.790
but it was definitely the last thing I thought would come my way.

2314
02:30:12.000 --> 02:30:14.490
I still remember feeling

2315
02:30:16.050 --> 02:30:20.580
almost guilty calling my teammates to let them know.
So I'm like,

2316
02:30:21.300 --> 02:30:24.810
Hey,
can you,
can you come to DC on October 1st?
Because,
um,

2317
02:30:25.890 --> 02:30:29.220
I'm getting them at a lottery and I felt like I had to apologize to them.

2318
02:30:29.221 --> 02:30:32.250
Like the team was amazing that day.

2319
02:30:32.251 --> 02:30:36.970
The team did everything and a lot of these guys,
you know,

2320
02:30:36.990 --> 02:30:39.370
kept going for years and years after I got out.
Like,

2321
02:30:39.820 --> 02:30:40.653
<v 6>okay,</v>

2322
02:30:42.070 --> 02:30:44.190
<v 4>I don't know why I'm getting this.
Hmm.</v>

2323
02:30:44.850 --> 02:30:48.180
<v 7>Where else?
It's,
it's awesome.
And I'm sure they all thought to themselves,
well,</v>

2324
02:30:48.181 --> 02:30:52.860
uh,
that maybe the fact that you saved my life and kept me alive might be the

2325
02:30:52.861 --> 02:30:57.730
reason.
So yeah,
that's a unbelievable,
awesome story.
Um,

2326
02:30:57.960 --> 02:31:02.250
and it sounds like there was definitely some good smooth government operating in

2327
02:31:02.251 --> 02:31:07.170
there as well.
They worked out.
It worked out to be pretty good secret.

2328
02:31:08.220 --> 02:31:10.640
Pretty awesome that they get it from you.
You know,

2329
02:31:10.920 --> 02:31:13.740
after we stepped out of the oval,
you know,
John Kelly,
he's like,

2330
02:31:14.100 --> 02:31:15.360
sorry I had to pull a trick on you.

2331
02:31:16.530 --> 02:31:20.130
And he's like such an honest guy that he guilty about that

2332
02:31:20.760 --> 02:31:24.290
<v 2>green,
like such a good guys.
I am really sorry I had to do that.
It's okay.</v>

2333
02:31:25.020 --> 02:31:29.550
I forgive you.
And then,
um,
how,
when,

2334
02:31:29.610 --> 02:31:32.940
when you go talking about the cancer a little bit,

2335
02:31:32.941 --> 02:31:36.420
when you go in for radiation,
when you go in for Chemo,

2336
02:31:36.780 --> 02:31:40.890
like I,
I,
you know,
I've known people that have gone on chemo port,

2337
02:31:40.920 --> 02:31:44.310
it's like crushing,
uh,
physically.

2338
02:31:45.180 --> 02:31:48.320
<v 4>Uh,
so
with,
um,</v>

2339
02:31:48.370 --> 02:31:53.370
with my treatments were in a hurry assessment phase right now to figure out what

2340
02:31:54.321 --> 02:31:58.930
we're doing.
But the last couple of years I've been on,
uh,

2341
02:31:59.070 --> 02:32:01.670
said,
okay,
it's super,
super far out in the weeds,

2342
02:32:01.671 --> 02:32:06.260
but it's a targeted therapy for my,
for my very specific kind of lung cancer.

2343
02:32:06.740 --> 02:32:11.600
And so I take one pill every day and yeah,

2344
02:32:12.190 --> 02:32:16.430
it's got me two years down the road.
Uh,
so it,

2345
02:32:18.440 --> 02:32:23.390
the,
there's ups and downs with it.
Um,
some,

2346
02:32:25.460 --> 02:32:28.820
you know,
definitely some side effects.
I think generally speaking,

2347
02:32:28.821 --> 02:32:32.150
it's better than what you think of his chemo.
Um,

2348
02:32:32.510 --> 02:32:37.430
I know it's a pissed off a lot of

2349
02:32:38.930 --> 02:32:42.110
keyboard warriors and the sergeant majors out there in the world.

2350
02:32:42.111 --> 02:32:46.880
Like I didn't shave for the,
for the ceremony and I was like,
well,

2351
02:32:46.910 --> 02:32:50.600
cause I had a,
a rash from,
from my treatment.

2352
02:32:51.050 --> 02:32:55.940
So I physically couldn't shave at the time,
but some people took offense like,

2353
02:32:56.870 --> 02:32:57.550
sorry,

2354
02:32:57.550 --> 02:33:01.940
<v 2>really?
I want,
I,
I want it.</v>

2355
02:33:02.540 --> 02:33:06.420
It,
it was,
you know,
I just,
it's awesome.

2356
02:33:06.990 --> 02:33:10.300
That's only in America.
Could you say,
oh that guy got the medal of honor.

2357
02:33:10.360 --> 02:33:14.070
You might want to shave next time.
That's,

2358
02:33:14.350 --> 02:33:17.210
that's professional jealousy yet it's Fido straight.
Yeah.
Yeah.

2359
02:33:18.710 --> 02:33:20.400
<v 4>So I made it,</v>

2360
02:33:22.180 --> 02:33:26.060
we try not to chase down to many the people,
but a few of them are like,
oh,

2361
02:33:26.061 --> 02:33:28.610
just so you know,
like this is why I have a nice day.

2362
02:33:30.100 --> 02:33:33.950
<v 2>Mean what are you doing day to day now?
So are you still,
do you work?</v>

2363
02:33:33.970 --> 02:33:35.360
Are you working right now?
Secret Service?

2364
02:33:35.361 --> 02:33:37.700
Do you have to put any time with them or you aren't like some medical leave

2365
02:33:37.701 --> 02:33:40.070
right now?
Did you stay in the secret service?

2366
02:33:40.560 --> 02:33:43.460
<v 4>Uh,
yeah.
I'm still stole the secret service.
Some,</v>

2367
02:33:43.570 --> 02:33:45.400
a few people have asked me not what the metal,

2368
02:33:45.401 --> 02:33:47.180
like the secret service just to cover.
Yeah.

2369
02:33:48.110 --> 02:33:51.860
<v 2>Yeah.
That's what I did when I was talking to my wife.
You know,</v>

2370
02:33:51.861 --> 02:33:54.470
my wife has been talking to your wife and,
um,

2371
02:33:55.280 --> 02:34:00.170
I said something along the lines of like,
Oh,
you know,
we'll talk about,
you know,

2372
02:34:00.440 --> 02:34:02.780
using the secrets of needs and the secret service.
And my wife said,

2373
02:34:02.810 --> 02:34:03.621
and my wife's a Brit,

2374
02:34:03.621 --> 02:34:08.621
so she wasn't like fully comprehend American government like an American does.

2375
02:34:09.650 --> 02:34:11.660
But you know,
I said,
so,
you know,
we'll probably talk about,
you know,

2376
02:34:11.661 --> 02:34:15.230
him being in the secret service.
And my wife of course,
literally says,

2377
02:34:16.310 --> 02:34:18.010
but isn't that a

2378
02:34:18.090 --> 02:34:22.230
<v 5>secret?
So yeah.</v>

2379
02:34:22.300 --> 02:34:26.380
Could cover a cover for your,
uh,
covert operations that you are now conducting.

2380
02:34:26.810 --> 02:34:31.250
<v 4>Yeah.
Um,
yeah,
no,
it's,
yeah.
So once I,</v>

2381
02:34:31.280 --> 02:34:33.500
once I was diagnosed a couple years ago,

2382
02:34:33.950 --> 02:34:38.900
I just switched over from being operational and counter assaults you when I'm

2383
02:34:38.901 --> 02:34:41.250
going to say operations here,
but now I'm in the operations section.
Got It.

2384
02:34:41.440 --> 02:34:45.200
So I just send emails to people and um,
I'm a keyboard warrior myself now.

2385
02:34:45.770 --> 02:34:47.630
Like you are not working hard enough.
Work harder.
Yeah.

2386
02:34:50.400 --> 02:34:55.320
<v 5>You might want to shave while you're working harder by the way.
Yeah.
And,</v>

2387
02:34:55.321 --> 02:34:59.190
and that's uh,
and then you got your,
your wife and your kids.

2388
02:34:59.520 --> 02:35:00.353
And how old are your kids?

2389
02:35:00.680 --> 02:35:05.540
<v 4>Uh,
our boys are our older son,
Cameron,
who because I had was,</v>

2390
02:35:05.870 --> 02:35:07.520
was three months at the time of the battle.
He's,

2391
02:35:07.521 --> 02:35:12.260
he's 11 now and our younger son Tyler,
he's,
he's eight.
So yeah,

2392
02:35:12.261 --> 02:35:15.950
my wife has kino multiple fulltime jobs.

2393
02:35:15.951 --> 02:35:18.650
You're trying to keep those kids,
you know,

2394
02:35:19.610 --> 02:35:23.750
where they need to be when they need to be there.
Like with the secret service.

2395
02:35:24.710 --> 02:35:27.170
Um,
I can't remember the exact day count,

2396
02:35:27.171 --> 02:35:31.090
but the last year I was like fully able to travel everything.

2397
02:35:31.110 --> 02:35:35.330
I traveled like 130 days or something.
And you know,

2398
02:35:35.360 --> 02:35:37.910
at least where like the military time deployments,

2399
02:35:37.911 --> 02:35:41.840
like you're going to leave in August.
Like,
okay,
that's in the future.

2400
02:35:41.841 --> 02:35:46.460
I know when it is,
you're going to be gone for seven months.
Whereas,
you know,

2401
02:35:46.461 --> 02:35:50.000
the secret service were dependent on people.

2402
02:35:51.050 --> 02:35:55.760
Does the president want to go over here?
If he does,
we're going,

2403
02:35:55.790 --> 02:35:59.030
guess what?
It doesn't matter what we had a scheduled next week,

2404
02:35:59.180 --> 02:36:02.810
it's going to happen.
Um,
so,
you know,

2405
02:36:02.870 --> 02:36:07.850
in 130 days on sound that bad.
It's two days here,
three days there,

2406
02:36:08.310 --> 02:36:09.980
a,
call it 8:00 PM.

2407
02:36:10.370 --> 02:36:14.690
Tomorrow morning you're on a plane at 6:00 AM get packed.

2408
02:36:15.650 --> 02:36:20.390
So,
you know,
she's,
she's been,
she was amazing at balancing all of those things.

2409
02:36:20.391 --> 02:36:23.300
I came,
came with a job and then,

2410
02:36:25.460 --> 02:36:30.180
then I threw in a monkey wrench with the whole,
I have cancer everywhere.

2411
02:36:30.220 --> 02:36:31.700
It's make it more about me now.

2412
02:36:34.400 --> 02:36:37.190
So it gives the kids were,
um,

2413
02:36:38.270 --> 02:36:42.760
what was that kindergarten and third grade,
I think,
where the ages right?

2414
02:36:42.780 --> 02:36:46.730
I know it's like they were just starting to get a little bit easier and you
know,

2415
02:36:46.731 --> 02:36:50.500
she's kind of come up for air like,
yeah,
hold on.
I need to,

2416
02:36:50.730 --> 02:36:52.480
I need to challenge you a little more.
Sorry.

2417
02:36:53.980 --> 02:36:57.590
<v 5>Well,
it's a,
you know,
sounds like an,
I met her today.
Sinks like awesome,</v>

2418
02:36:57.770 --> 02:37:00.840
awesome woman,
awesome family.
And,
um,
I mean,

2419
02:37:01.340 --> 02:37:03.590
just a incredible story from,

2420
02:37:03.591 --> 02:37:06.260
for everything that you've done and what you've been through,

2421
02:37:06.261 --> 02:37:09.850
what you're going through and the perseverance that you're showing is just,
um,

2422
02:37:10.290 --> 02:37:14.330
perseverance that you showed and the perseverance that you continue to show is

2423
02:37:14.331 --> 02:37:16.130
just,
it's,
it's man and

2424
02:37:16.130 --> 02:37:16.970
<v 7>I'm probably a good,</v>

2425
02:37:17.060 --> 02:37:21.120
probably good as good a place of any to try and wrap this up.
Um,

2426
02:37:21.380 --> 02:37:24.920
but you know,
man,
thanks for coming on and,

2427
02:37:26.000 --> 02:37:27.320
and really thanks for,

2428
02:37:27.350 --> 02:37:31.610
thanks for giving me an example to everyone of you know,
how to,

2429
02:37:31.640 --> 02:37:36.080
how to train,
how to fight and how to live.
It's a,
it's awesome.

2430
02:37:36.570 --> 02:37:36.751
<v 4>Well,</v>

2431
02:37:36.751 --> 02:37:40.560
I appreciate you saying that and I'm not just going to say this cause I'm on

2432
02:37:40.561 --> 02:37:42.660
your show.
Like I haven't been listening to your,

2433
02:37:43.020 --> 02:37:46.470
you're a podcast for a long time.
I,
I,

2434
02:37:46.750 --> 02:37:48.210
I've listened to many different episodes,

2435
02:37:48.211 --> 02:37:51.120
but there is one in particular where you,
you know,

2436
02:37:51.121 --> 02:37:55.020
you did the book reviews and the a man's search for meaning.

2437
02:37:55.850 --> 02:38:00.030
He did that one I think like two or three months after I got diagnosed.

2438
02:38:00.031 --> 02:38:04.010
And that was just mean.

2439
02:38:04.080 --> 02:38:09.000
I like to think I'm a determined guy and like I can do focus through stop.

2440
02:38:09.001 --> 02:38:10.890
But you know,

2441
02:38:10.891 --> 02:38:15.360
the cancer battle is definitely very different than an army battle.
Like again,

2442
02:38:15.361 --> 02:38:18.650
we get discussed earlier,
like if you could shoot me,
I could show you.
Yeah,

2443
02:38:18.810 --> 02:38:23.610
we'll see.
This is that kind of behind the scenes unknown enemy.

2444
02:38:23.611 --> 02:38:25.550
And so just,
you know,

2445
02:38:25.590 --> 02:38:28.800
hearing about like that book and then I immediately went out and got the book,

2446
02:38:28.801 --> 02:38:32.910
read it and like just stuff.
So your body has to definitely,

2447
02:38:33.780 --> 02:38:35.100
you know,
not only on those

2448
02:38:36.840 --> 02:38:39.240
long boring nights where you can't sleep because this,

2449
02:38:39.270 --> 02:38:41.970
this hurts or that hurts like something to listen to.

2450
02:38:41.971 --> 02:38:44.190
But it's definitely been very meaningful

2451
02:38:46.200 --> 02:38:51.090
to me and in those respects.
So I really appreciate it and
hopefully,

2452
02:38:52.560 --> 02:38:53.530
hopefully with someone or too,

2453
02:38:54.210 --> 02:38:57.840
<v 7>you know,
interesting today.
Oh Man.
No Sir.
That's it.
It's awesome.
Um,</v>

2454
02:38:58.030 --> 02:39:02.560
and we'll,
we'll keep doing it echoes,
speaking of the podcast,

2455
02:39:02.590 --> 02:39:05.830
speaking of,
um,
you know,

2456
02:39:06.250 --> 02:39:10.840
taking the fight to the enemy seen and unseen.
Sure.
Yeah.

2457
02:39:10.970 --> 02:39:14.200
Big Time.
I know you like to,
you know,
give us some ideas,
some,

2458
02:39:15.070 --> 02:39:18.850
some help along that.
Yeah,
I have a question first.
Okay.

2459
02:39:19.750 --> 02:39:23.470
So when you got hit in the arm that time that you didn't realize it or whatever,

2460
02:39:23.500 --> 02:39:27.810
like what was that like a ricochet or something?
Just the bullet dude.
Yeah.
Yeah.

2461
02:39:27.850 --> 02:39:31.310
But like what was it?
You know what happened with it?
Oh,

2462
02:39:31.330 --> 02:39:35.990
you mean it's the tiniest little scar you can barely see.
It was like,

2463
02:39:36.460 --> 02:39:40.640
like,
uh,
like it just barely grazed you kind of thing.
Yeah.
Grays to me,
when I,

2464
02:39:40.670 --> 02:39:43.900
when I got the uniform off,
I mean there was,
there was like,
there was cut,

2465
02:39:43.901 --> 02:39:46.810
there was a bleeding,
there was bruising.
Um,
like I said,

2466
02:39:46.811 --> 02:39:51.610
it couldn't cause it's a penny.
So much stuff is going on that like boom,
yeah,

2467
02:39:51.611 --> 02:39:54.400
you get hit,
but then it kind of gets blended in with all the,

2468
02:39:54.430 --> 02:39:59.310
all the rest of the chaos kind of thing.
Yeah.
I mean so much with,
with the,

2469
02:39:59.510 --> 02:40:01.900
the air strikes at southern,
we were talking about like,
yeah,
stuff was,

2470
02:40:02.480 --> 02:40:05.770
was just hitting you,
falling on you and stuff was,

2471
02:40:06.010 --> 02:40:08.980
it was just stuff was always going on.

2472
02:40:10.510 --> 02:40:13.850
<v 4>So
shot,</v>

2473
02:40:14.110 --> 02:40:15.980
<v 7>you know?
Yeah.</v>

2474
02:40:17.040 --> 02:40:19.530
You know what else is crazy is I just,
you know,

2475
02:40:19.531 --> 02:40:23.130
like echo doesn't ever write anything down during these things.

2476
02:40:23.820 --> 02:40:27.240
And you've made that statement like probably like 45 minutes ago,

2477
02:40:27.590 --> 02:40:29.850
but echoes has been sitting there thinking like,
Dang,
what happened?

2478
02:40:30.630 --> 02:40:34.530
Can we expand on that when my time comes?
I got that question.

2479
02:40:34.920 --> 02:40:38.670
I'm coming at you wrong.
Well yeah,
you sort of wonder,

2480
02:40:38.671 --> 02:40:41.490
cause he just sorta mentioned it,
you know,
like,

2481
02:40:41.520 --> 02:40:43.650
oh kind of like on your book Terminator One,

2482
02:40:43.710 --> 02:40:46.740
the first one where they kind of recover from the shootout and then they're

2483
02:40:46.741 --> 02:40:51.720
under the bridge and then she started kind of goes,
hey,
what's up?
You know,

2484
02:40:51.721 --> 02:40:54.780
he goes,
Oh yeah,
he got me right there and just sort of glosses over it.

2485
02:40:55.230 --> 02:40:58.890
She's like,
you got shot.
Like,
oh,
what's up?
That's how I was feeling with you.

2486
02:40:59.550 --> 02:41:02.830
You know what I'm saying?
Well,
luckily

2487
02:41:04.640 --> 02:41:08.550
I did.
Did he get shot at?
But luckily,
not for my sake.

2488
02:41:08.551 --> 02:41:11.010
And for Rietta people just not knowing when it was,

2489
02:41:11.700 --> 02:41:14.310
it wasn't worse cause it'll be deal.

2490
02:41:15.310 --> 02:41:19.740
Keep going about about,
uh,
about the job.

2491
02:41:21.120 --> 02:41:25.680
It's crazy now.
Millimeters and inches it inches.

2492
02:41:26.820 --> 02:41:31.590
But yeah.
So yeah,
if we're staying on the path,
speaking of which,
okay,

2493
02:41:31.591 --> 02:41:35.700
let's start with origin for gin up in Maine.
American made company,

2494
02:41:35.730 --> 02:41:39.990
American founded company.
It just an American company.

2495
02:41:39.991 --> 02:41:43.560
I think their sums it up.
Excellent.
But they go deep with American made though.

2496
02:41:43.561 --> 02:41:47.880
That's the thing.
True.
So anyway,
so you're doing Jujitsu,
which we all are.

2497
02:41:48.180 --> 02:41:50.940
You want to gie,
you get it from origin,
all made in America.

2498
02:41:51.000 --> 02:41:55.980
Nngugi out by the way out.
A real good on.
Have you used it yet?

2499
02:41:56.130 --> 02:42:00.980
I know you're kind of off the,
did you get to for a little bit,
got a little,
uh,

2500
02:42:01.000 --> 02:42:05.310
got a little dinged up in the knee area,
but you used it.
Yes.

2501
02:42:05.460 --> 02:42:10.010
Good assessment.
Solid.
Legit as we sit in the,
in the history.

2502
02:42:10.270 --> 02:42:14.460
Yeah.
Yup.
Uh,
also rash guards on there.
Even the,
you know,

2503
02:42:14.461 --> 02:42:18.900
the existing ghees are good,
are exceptional actually.

2504
02:42:18.901 --> 02:42:19.830
They're the best in the world.

2505
02:42:19.831 --> 02:42:24.831
Factually made by Jujitsu people in America with American made products.

2506
02:42:26.730 --> 02:42:31.680
How much your items did you do?
How much rolling did you do?
We did.

2507
02:42:32.270 --> 02:42:36.960
Uh,
we did a fair amount and then at some point,

2508
02:42:36.961 --> 02:42:41.550
like I mentioned one that you teach art and showed up and kind of reset the way

2509
02:42:41.551 --> 02:42:43.410
we were training.
Uh,

2510
02:42:43.470 --> 02:42:48.470
we did a little less rolling and he found some guy just outside Fort Bragg.

2511
02:42:49.741 --> 02:42:54.600
It was like,
I just met him fights in,
I think it was from Miami.
He's like,

2512
02:42:54.601 --> 02:42:58.170
I've been in fights in Miami for you for years and years and he's really good at

2513
02:42:58.171 --> 02:43:02.460
it apparently.
Uh,
so we did a little less rolling with him cause he,
you know,

2514
02:43:02.461 --> 02:43:05.430
he kind of brought up the point like with all this stuff you're carrying,

2515
02:43:05.431 --> 02:43:06.780
if you end up on the ground,

2516
02:43:08.220 --> 02:43:12.940
that's not a good day for you on the ground and you better know what you even

2517
02:43:12.941 --> 02:43:15.790
with all that stuff on.
Yeah.
We,
he,

2518
02:43:15.940 --> 02:43:18.770
he kind of taught us a different way,
you know,

2519
02:43:18.970 --> 02:43:21.670
a fighting if you get on the ground.
Yeah.

2520
02:43:22.300 --> 02:43:26.470
Get back up as quickly as you can.
The primary,

2521
02:43:26.770 --> 02:43:29.920
the primary purpose of Jujitsu in self defense situation is to get up and get

2522
02:43:29.921 --> 02:43:34.030
away from him.
Not to put a triangle on them or put up some kind of uh,
you know,

2523
02:43:34.120 --> 02:43:37.780
pull guard,
guard on the guy.
Like that's not smart negative.

2524
02:43:38.860 --> 02:43:43.120
The other funny thing is
like I was,
you know,

2525
02:43:43.121 --> 02:43:45.190
I was talking about Jujitsu being important and all that stuff,

2526
02:43:45.520 --> 02:43:49.840
but like in the seal teams,
people would get really into combatives,

2527
02:43:49.841 --> 02:43:53.850
which is cool.
I'm down with being in Madison,
I am totally into combatives.

2528
02:43:53.860 --> 02:43:58.060
I'm totally into MMA and Jujitsu and wrestling and boxing and a tie and whatever

2529
02:43:58.061 --> 02:44:00.160
else I can find that is effective.

2530
02:44:01.480 --> 02:44:06.480
But if you have a choice between being really good at shooting your guns and

2531
02:44:06.700 --> 02:44:09.730
being really good at are unlocking people,
if you're in the,

2532
02:44:10.180 --> 02:44:13.360
if you're in the military,
it's better to be good at shooting here.
Guns.
Now,

2533
02:44:13.361 --> 02:44:15.400
luckily I'm here to tell you,
you can get good at both,

2534
02:44:16.190 --> 02:44:19.500
but prioritize being able to shoot really well.

2535
02:44:21.340 --> 02:44:25.240
Most of my workouts and now with with the whole cancer thing or just locks.

2536
02:44:25.270 --> 02:44:28.390
But no,
maybe I'll check out one of these keys and just walk around.
Oh,

2537
02:44:28.430 --> 02:44:32.920
we can get your leg.
Well we get it all.
Get your keys for your kids too,

2538
02:44:33.520 --> 02:44:37.330
cause your kids should be doing Jujitsu.
That's for sure.
If I agree.

2539
02:44:38.080 --> 02:44:42.250
But also on there,
they have other apparel items fashionable.

2540
02:44:43.000 --> 02:44:46.390
We don't know.
You don't use the word the word.
He doesn't like the concept.

2541
02:44:46.391 --> 02:44:48.910
I get it.
But the fact remains,
Pete,

2542
02:44:48.911 --> 02:44:53.500
he knows that the peak Robert's founder of origin,
those a little bit about Pete,

2543
02:44:53.560 --> 02:44:56.590
my partner up in,
uh,
up in Maine,
he's got like a little,

2544
02:44:57.170 --> 02:45:01.450
he's got a little fashion sense to a little spring course,
which I have zero.

2545
02:45:01.451 --> 02:45:03.310
So there's a contrast there.
You know,

2546
02:45:03.620 --> 02:45:06.840
people talk about a color.

2547
02:45:08.840 --> 02:45:09.673
Yeah.

2548
02:45:11.260 --> 02:45:16.060
As long as it's black or gray or I get it.
So anyways,
anyway,

2549
02:45:16.061 --> 02:45:19.270
also supplements what best kind of supplements,
joint supplements.

2550
02:45:19.271 --> 02:45:23.290
Apparently when we were young,
we're about the same age.
I've estimated.

2551
02:45:23.291 --> 02:45:26.110
When were you born?
78 so I just turned 40.

2552
02:45:26.610 --> 02:45:30.670
So you're one year younger than me on the list.
Back when we were young,

2553
02:45:31.090 --> 02:45:35.800
we thought,
what protein supplements,
right?
Create.
Remember when creating him,

2554
02:45:36.150 --> 02:45:38.920
everyone's like,
hell yeah,
that's the team.
That's so much of that stuff.

2555
02:45:39.370 --> 02:45:41.980
As it turned out,
oculus not even as important,

2556
02:45:42.070 --> 02:45:45.760
not even nearly as important as joint supplement.
So Jocko of course,

2557
02:45:45.761 --> 02:45:50.350
makes supplements.
Jocko,
joint warfare for what?

2558
02:45:50.380 --> 02:45:55.120
Anti inflammatory stuff.
Glucosomine constraint.
Super Krill oil.

2559
02:45:55.210 --> 02:45:59.200
Krill oil.
Very important for your joints.
Um,
keeps you in the game.

2560
02:45:59.380 --> 02:46:01.300
Even at our age,

2561
02:46:02.670 --> 02:46:07.670
I am tripling up on joint warfare right now to help the recovery process of my

2562
02:46:07.821 --> 02:46:11.270
knee.
Oh yeah.
Men,
the joint where and the Krill Oil Combo,
whatever.

2563
02:46:11.271 --> 02:46:14.390
When you're consistent,
I mean you could stay consistent.
So I get it,

2564
02:46:14.630 --> 02:46:19.340
but I have a experience with inconsistency.
So when,

2565
02:46:19.400 --> 02:46:24.000
uh,
when I get consistent,
man,
it's like you're on this like road,
like he,

2566
02:46:24.001 --> 02:46:26.090
you know,
he could dinged up or whatever,
but like you go,

2567
02:46:26.480 --> 02:46:29.930
it's like they heal up so quick and I don't want to make like,
Ooh,
you're like,

2568
02:46:30.230 --> 02:46:32.840
what's the kind of the x man guy who heals him?
Sorry,

2569
02:46:33.140 --> 02:46:35.270
I'm not necessarily saying you're like Wolverine,

2570
02:46:35.480 --> 02:46:38.240
but you feel like you kind of are wolverine.
Like you when you get,

2571
02:46:38.241 --> 02:46:42.500
you know how like me anyway when I get hurt or like Dingdong like Dang,

2572
02:46:42.501 --> 02:46:46.850
how long am I out now?
You know,
a week,
two weeks,
whatever,
like with this.

2573
02:46:46.851 --> 02:46:50.840
And I like,
I don't even worry about it just in the game consistently taking it.

2574
02:46:50.960 --> 02:46:54.770
So I dig it.
This is what I'm saying.
Well since you mentioned Wolverine,

2575
02:46:54.890 --> 02:46:58.550
I'll say that with my SF and then cancer,

2576
02:46:58.551 --> 02:47:01.040
like we spent more time,

2577
02:47:01.041 --> 02:47:05.390
my wife and I talking about the possibility that that phone call with somebody

2578
02:47:05.391 --> 02:47:06.224
going to enrollment.

2579
02:47:08.420 --> 02:47:12.120
<v 2>Then when we legitimately had conversations</v>

2580
02:47:14.060 --> 02:47:17.370
given everything,
you know,
yeah,
you might be a good candidate for this,

2581
02:47:17.390 --> 02:47:20.800
this new program and we're putting together my middle daughter,

2582
02:47:20.830 --> 02:47:24.370
she watches a those of,
what is it?
Avengers.

2583
02:47:26.080 --> 02:47:30.970
So she watches her stuff.
Does that have wolverine it?
Uh,
no.
Right.
No,

2584
02:47:30.971 --> 02:47:33.730
that's excellent.
Excellent.
Is wellcare when she watches those things,

2585
02:47:34.270 --> 02:47:35.590
but the other day,

2586
02:47:35.591 --> 02:47:39.090
and she's also kind of got level right cause he's nine and she kind of went a

2587
02:47:39.091 --> 02:47:41.110
little bit of a bubble,
you know what I mean?
And she's nine.

2588
02:47:41.680 --> 02:47:43.900
But the other day I started the started,

2589
02:47:43.901 --> 02:47:46.750
there's a whole like thing with her where I was kind of tone.
I was like,
yeah,

2590
02:47:46.751 --> 02:47:50.020
you know,
cause I was saying all my knees,
I was like,
you know my Neil,
he,

2591
02:47:50.021 --> 02:47:51.400
it'll heal up quickly.
And I said,

2592
02:47:51.850 --> 02:47:55.830
then I said like I got the little idea in my head of something creative to play

2593
02:47:55.900 --> 02:47:59.680
a game to play.
And so I said like,
yeah,
you know it's weird sweetie.

2594
02:47:59.681 --> 02:48:03.400
Cause whenever I get injured at Kiehl's up really,
really fast,

2595
02:48:03.580 --> 02:48:07.240
it's really weird.
It's always been like that.
Well not always.

2596
02:48:09.010 --> 02:48:11.560
And then I started saying,
well you know what time,
it's really weird.

2597
02:48:11.561 --> 02:48:16.330
But I had this weird memory of like when when I was in the navy and I went to

2598
02:48:16.331 --> 02:48:19.210
the doctor and then I didn't remember things for a while.

2599
02:48:19.510 --> 02:48:24.510
And I remember like them putting things in me and her eyes were so big,

2600
02:48:24.791 --> 02:48:29.791
she was so stoked for about another minute and she thought I was pulled over

2601
02:48:32.530 --> 02:48:37.060
because I started out when you start on when something comes from them,
right.

2602
02:48:37.240 --> 02:48:40.060
So it was her that said like,
oh,
how long are you going to be hurt for?

2603
02:48:40.120 --> 02:48:42.430
So she initiated this whole conversation.

2604
02:48:42.530 --> 02:48:46.150
So that gives me a massive advantage in this trick I'm about to play because I'm

2605
02:48:46.151 --> 02:48:48.790
playing the trick based on,
on her reality.

2606
02:48:50.040 --> 02:48:51.340
You just came out of the blue,

2607
02:48:51.341 --> 02:48:54.220
come on the tray with some trick or some conversation?
No,

2608
02:48:54.310 --> 02:48:57.370
it's part of what she asked me out.
You know,

2609
02:48:57.400 --> 02:48:58.820
I wasn't just sitting there plotting on it.

2610
02:48:58.920 --> 02:49:03.450
<v 7>Yeah,
kind of.
So that's kind of like your thing,
how you make,
like when you,</v>

2611
02:49:03.620 --> 02:49:08.340
um,
when you come up with a plan or a correction,
a plant or whatever,

2612
02:49:08.370 --> 02:49:11.330
like how you lead people and I see what you're doing when you do it,

2613
02:49:11.490 --> 02:49:12.550
but it still works by the way.

2614
02:49:12.640 --> 02:49:15.450
So you lead people to think that they made the plan.
See,

2615
02:49:15.451 --> 02:49:18.550
I see that you just did that to your daughter.
She's not by the practiced on her,

2616
02:49:18.560 --> 02:49:20.820
but yeah,
that's how I see it.
I get it now.

2617
02:49:21.240 --> 02:49:26.240
I get it fully chuck nonetheless supplements mark as well.

2618
02:49:26.520 --> 02:49:29.790
Additional proteins.
I still don't neglect the protein,
don't get it wrong.

2619
02:49:29.880 --> 02:49:32.220
I just find the joint supplements to be,

2620
02:49:32.700 --> 02:49:37.020
somebody asked me on Twitter if I was on growth hormone because of the way I

2621
02:49:37.021 --> 02:49:42.021
looked and reasonable though I said I was actually,

2622
02:49:42.901 --> 02:49:47.100
it was actually supposed to be a derogatory comment because it was one of those

2623
02:49:47.101 --> 02:49:49.490
little clips that someone put up a me talking about something and,

2624
02:49:49.660 --> 02:49:53.130
and then someone with the shot,
right.
He made it said,

2625
02:49:53.880 --> 02:49:57.410
why would I listen to this guy who like,
he's been on growth hormones whole life.

2626
02:49:57.480 --> 02:50:01.570
Right.
And uh,
and I just replied back like I've,

2627
02:50:01.970 --> 02:50:06.970
I've never been on any kind of growth hormone unless you count steak.

2628
02:50:10.510 --> 02:50:12.360
I have fun,
fun on Twitter.

2629
02:50:14.700 --> 02:50:19.410
Twitter is Twitter.
I know you have Twitter.
I don't use Twitter.

2630
02:50:19.750 --> 02:50:24.000
I use it.
I'm trying to figure out an Instagram thing.
Twitter,

2631
02:50:24.660 --> 02:50:28.920
it makes sense to my brain.
Instagram is also can be fun,

2632
02:50:29.160 --> 02:50:33.180
but Twitter is basically just a bunch of one liners.

2633
02:50:33.210 --> 02:50:34.980
It's just a bunch of one liners.
That's all it is.

2634
02:50:35.000 --> 02:50:37.770
One Line zingers and it's just 24 hours a day.
If,

2635
02:50:37.860 --> 02:50:40.170
if you want to sit there and make one liners all day long,

2636
02:50:40.530 --> 02:50:43.500
you know that's what you can do with that thing.
That's a good way to put it.

2637
02:50:43.501 --> 02:50:45.030
It's just one line and the what's,

2638
02:50:45.031 --> 02:50:49.800
what's lame about it or good about it depending on your perspective is if you

2639
02:50:49.801 --> 02:50:53.710
and I are having a conversation and you say something and I sing like I,

2640
02:50:53.820 --> 02:50:57.420
I hit it.
That took a little quick thinking with Twitter,

2641
02:50:57.720 --> 02:51:00.550
you could actually sit there and look at it for 12 minutes.

2642
02:51:00.590 --> 02:51:04.830
You could look up words in the dictionary if you wanted to and you can say,
oh,

2643
02:51:04.980 --> 02:51:07.860
this is going to be really weedy and you can plan it out.

2644
02:51:07.861 --> 02:51:11.700
You can do some research and then you can respond and for all anyone knows,

2645
02:51:11.790 --> 02:51:14.610
you just looked at that and just threw it out there so you can just got the

2646
02:51:14.611 --> 02:51:15.560
notification.
Yeah,

2647
02:51:15.600 --> 02:51:20.600
you just saw it and I'm just throwing out this advanced shot back at you.

2648
02:51:21.480 --> 02:51:25.740
Whereas the reality is that's not what happened.
So it's a really interesting,

2649
02:51:25.830 --> 02:51:30.360
now I will say sometimes because I go onto Twitter and I reply like a lot at

2650
02:51:30.361 --> 02:51:32.550
once because I don't sit there and look at Twitter all the time.

2651
02:51:32.820 --> 02:51:35.130
So then I go back and I just reply really fast.

2652
02:51:35.190 --> 02:51:39.100
So a lot of times I will do things that are,
you know,
just like from one team

2653
02:51:40.740 --> 02:51:43.860
and occasionally I make mistakes.
You know,
there's someone on Twitter called the,

2654
02:51:43.930 --> 02:51:48.500
there's a Twitter thing called grammar police.
What do you mean?
Like an account?

2655
02:51:49.770 --> 02:51:54.390
It's an account.
Okay.
I used,
and I was an English major.
Ron,

2656
02:51:54.391 --> 02:51:58.380
I know you're an economics guy,
so you're in the numbers and the letters.

2657
02:51:59.010 --> 02:52:02.530
So I,
I put your,
and again,
I'm,

2658
02:52:02.620 --> 02:52:06.880
I'm tweeting at a 47 tweets a minute.
I'm just boom,
boom.

2659
02:52:07.180 --> 02:52:12.180
And I used your y o u r instead of y.

2660
02:52:13.680 --> 02:52:17.250
O u r apostrophe.
E

2661
02:52:20.020 --> 02:52:23.380
apostrophe Ari.
Yeah.
And so then,

2662
02:52:23.381 --> 02:52:28.381
and so then up pops like probably an hour later up pop's grammar police and it

2663
02:52:29.591 --> 02:52:33.040
says,
and it's,
it's really,
I actually love the way they do it.
They don't.

2664
02:52:33.250 --> 02:52:36.310
They don't,
they don't,
they're not disparaging to you.

2665
02:52:36.730 --> 02:52:41.530
They just say for your information,
you used the wrong,
your,

2666
02:52:41.560 --> 02:52:42.990
the proper,
uh,

2667
02:52:43.630 --> 02:52:46.750
the proper grammar in this scenario would have been to use.

2668
02:52:47.050 --> 02:52:50.980
Why are you apostrophe?
Sorry.
Thank you.
And please correct yourself next time.

2669
02:52:51.110 --> 02:52:54.400
Signed grammar piece.
So I like the grammar police.

2670
02:52:54.401 --> 02:52:58.030
That's a good account thing.
Anyways,
we're going to deep,

2671
02:52:58.040 --> 02:53:01.330
she'll like account the Karma police person.
It's not a Bot.

2672
02:53:02.380 --> 02:53:05.740
Well he may be odd.
It may be a bot but it's a grammar police account.

2673
02:53:05.741 --> 02:53:06.490
You can follow them.

2674
02:53:06.490 --> 02:53:10.330
I should probably follow ground release going to what had been pictures they

2675
02:53:10.331 --> 02:53:15.220
share though.
Just Twitter.
Twitter doesn't need pictures.
Yeah,

2676
02:53:15.680 --> 02:53:17.800
I mean I guess Instagram you could just,
you,
they could've,

2677
02:53:17.830 --> 02:53:19.080
they could've blown up a picture.

2678
02:53:19.090 --> 02:53:24.090
An image of my incorrect usage of or it would just slide in the comments.

2679
02:53:24.870 --> 02:53:27.460
Right.
Cause you wouldn't really,
you didn't need a picture for comments.

2680
02:53:27.461 --> 02:53:32.170
So it'd be like true
and then they just slide in the comments.

2681
02:53:32.950 --> 02:53:37.790
But they should know that hurts.
Cause like I was an English major.

2682
02:53:38.550 --> 02:53:40.160
That's the only way you'll learn though.

2683
02:53:42.410 --> 02:53:46.530
We've got to get you some,
a warrior kid milk for your kids run.

2684
02:53:47.630 --> 02:53:52.210
Do you do when you were a kid,
did you ever drink strawberry quick?
Yes.

2685
02:53:52.390 --> 02:53:57.220
Did you like it?
Okay.
What about chocolate quick?
Yes.
Did you like it?

2686
02:53:57.730 --> 02:54:00.040
Yes.
Okay.
There you go.
Well,

2687
02:54:01.030 --> 02:54:03.820
for me it's strawberry quick was kind of like a big thing for me when I was

2688
02:54:03.821 --> 02:54:08.670
little kid.
Fake strawberry flavors.
It's so hit and miss.
Yeah.

2689
02:54:08.740 --> 02:54:13.630
Well
either one.
If you happen to like strawberry quick,

2690
02:54:14.470 --> 02:54:15.820
basically art,

2691
02:54:15.910 --> 02:54:20.860
this kids protein drink tastes exactly like that.
It's delicious.
It would be,

2692
02:54:20.861 --> 02:54:23.740
it's delicious to me.
It wouldn't be delicious to you.
I guess you'd spit it out.

2693
02:54:24.250 --> 02:54:25.083
I would spit it out.

2694
02:54:30.430 --> 02:54:33.850
So you'd be cool about it.
Well,
your kids,

2695
02:54:33.851 --> 02:54:37.300
hopefully they have better taste buds than you and they'd be like,
Whoa,

2696
02:54:37.301 --> 02:54:40.540
this stuff is amazing.
So anyways,
that's where your kid milk and it's,

2697
02:54:40.820 --> 02:54:42.300
it doesn't have any sugar and it's actually good for you.

2698
02:54:42.301 --> 02:54:45.310
It's got protein and vitamins and probiotics.
It's awesome.
So anyways,

2699
02:54:45.311 --> 02:54:48.820
that's that.
Also Jocko at the store,
it's called Jocko store.

2700
02:54:48.821 --> 02:54:53.050
That's where you can get apparel.
Jacola apparel
fashionable.

2701
02:54:53.720 --> 02:54:57.840
Well,
you know,
you see the dichotomy in this dark and try going there.

2702
02:54:57.841 --> 02:55:01.810
The thing is,
it's like,
it's not even fashionable,
but here's the thing I snuck,

2703
02:55:01.840 --> 02:55:06.050
I had to in covertly in insert elements,

2704
02:55:06.110 --> 02:55:08.810
sprinkles of fashion.
Okay.
Pete,
Robert Style.

2705
02:55:09.230 --> 02:55:12.750
Not quite that hardcore but hardcore fans like

2706
02:55:16.630 --> 02:55:20.570
yeah,
you're mine everybody.
I'm like Zoolander in your mind.

2707
02:55:20.750 --> 02:55:25.340
The um,
so,
so Jockos design,
right?

2708
02:55:25.550 --> 02:55:28.250
It's like his thing,
it's like not even designed,

2709
02:55:28.251 --> 02:55:33.100
the font he uses is like computer font,
literally not so it's like OCR,

2710
02:55:33.110 --> 02:55:35.490
whatever.
So he's like,
you know what discipline equals freedom.
You know,

2711
02:55:35.510 --> 02:55:38.900
we'll put it on a shirt and I'm like,
cool.
So I look at him like,

2712
02:55:38.901 --> 02:55:40.900
okay I dig it but it,

2713
02:55:40.920 --> 02:55:44.620
Lisa made the shirt like the shirt material.
It's like,
you know,

2714
02:55:44.750 --> 02:55:47.420
a bland and all this stuff.
It's not like some cheap,
uh,

2715
02:55:47.530 --> 02:55:52.130
what do you call like a boxy,
rugged,
I don't call it anything.

2716
02:55:52.131 --> 02:55:55.370
I call it a shirt.
Yeah.
See and that's my point right there.
See what I'm saying?

2717
02:55:55.640 --> 02:55:59.570
So that these items are going to be super basic,
non fashionable.

2718
02:56:00.170 --> 02:56:03.650
But when you get the apparel,
you can be like,
oh,
this is really wearable stuff.

2719
02:56:03.651 --> 02:56:07.460
There's really nice,
that's what I predict.
You'll think,
you know,
if,
if,

2720
02:56:07.790 --> 02:56:11.180
if history is any indicator.
But anyway,
a tee shirts on there.

2721
02:56:11.590 --> 02:56:13.880
We've got some lightweight hoodies on there.
Which Jocko,

2722
02:56:13.910 --> 02:56:17.360
are you even down for the lightweight hood?
Because so far people,

2723
02:56:17.361 --> 02:56:21.770
everyone know every single person who was like siding with Jocko in real life.

2724
02:56:21.771 --> 02:56:24.530
I'm not talking about Internet siting with Jochelson.
Yeah.

2725
02:56:24.531 --> 02:56:28.580
Hoodies or for like when you're cold you need uh,
uh,
a heavy hoodie.
Otherwise,

2726
02:56:28.581 --> 02:56:30.890
why are you even wearing a hoodie?
Just wear a shirt,
right?

2727
02:56:31.040 --> 02:56:35.020
Everybody know everybody who
is just ridiculous.

2728
02:56:35.021 --> 02:56:38.810
The lightweight Hoodie have changed their mind.
Every single person's mind.

2729
02:56:39.740 --> 02:56:44.200
Dave Berman be all good deal,
Dave.
Oh heck yeah.
Yeah,

2730
02:56:45.710 --> 02:56:49.460
I was wrong.
This hoodie is outstanding.
Oh yeah.

2731
02:56:49.610 --> 02:56:51.560
Actually I already knew that.
That's why we did it.

2732
02:56:52.070 --> 02:56:57.070
Like we'd hoodies shirts without rash guards for Jujitsu and otherwise and life

2733
02:56:57.561 --> 02:57:01.580
man.
And uh,
you know,
some women's stuff,
hats,
all some cool stuff.

2734
02:57:01.610 --> 02:57:05.390
I think it's cool.
People seem to think at school going there.
He likes something,

2735
02:57:05.420 --> 02:57:10.190
get something.
Chocolate store.com.
Ron,
how'd you like that?

2736
02:57:10.370 --> 02:57:13.760
How'd you like the tea is really good.
Definitely.

2737
02:57:15.820 --> 02:57:18.710
It's the best team you've ever tried.
It's better than strawberry quick.

2738
02:57:18.950 --> 02:57:19.930
It's way better.

2739
02:57:21.190 --> 02:57:26.190
Definitely would drink this strawberry click mean if it has the extra benefits

2740
02:57:26.241 --> 02:57:31.100
of the probiotics and the protein,
maybe I'll drink a little extra,
but cool.

2741
02:57:31.180 --> 02:57:32.270
If it's just strawberry quick.

2742
02:57:32.271 --> 02:57:36.620
Now Ron has been drinking Jocko White Tea with pomegranate.

2743
02:57:36.980 --> 02:57:37.370
Anyways,

2744
02:57:37.370 --> 02:57:42.370
certified organic by the one good thing about it is it after you finish this,

2745
02:57:42.471 --> 02:57:46.290
can you can deadlift 8,000 pounds and that's,
that's proven.
It's proven fact,

2746
02:57:46.310 --> 02:57:50.810
100% proven.
As a,
as a former former 18 delta medic,

2747
02:57:51.440 --> 02:57:54.680
I can help you run through the test and you'll see it's 100%.

2748
02:57:57.080 --> 02:57:57.913
Uh,

2749
02:57:58.220 --> 02:58:01.740
make sure you're subscribed to the podcast if you don't subscribe to it already,

2750
02:58:02.160 --> 02:58:06.980
<v 0>which is kind of ridiculous,
you know?
Yeah.
Let me,
Oh yeah.</v>

2751
02:58:07.140 --> 02:58:10.950
Oh and I just read review.
Yeah.
A Guy said

2752
02:58:13.050 --> 02:58:15.890
he was going through like his top five podcasts in the,

2753
02:58:15.970 --> 02:58:20.970
and then our podcasts came into his world as this is the podcast that I most

2754
02:58:22.860 --> 02:58:26.970
subscribe and unsubscribe to.
Okay.

2755
02:58:27.060 --> 02:58:28.020
And he says,

2756
02:58:28.170 --> 02:58:32.460
I subscribed to it because it's got great information on leadership and human

2757
02:58:32.461 --> 02:58:35.670
nature and history and war.
He goes,

2758
02:58:35.671 --> 02:58:40.671
but I unsubscribed to it because they spend a lot of times on some episodes

2759
02:58:42.691 --> 02:58:47.250
talking about Jujitsu,
which I don't do.
And this,
this wasn't a review on iTunes.

2760
02:58:47.251 --> 02:58:52.230
This was a review that he wrote in a blog or blog and tagged me in it on
Twitter,

2761
02:58:52.290 --> 02:58:55.710
his own blog or his own block because people tag you in their blog.

2762
02:58:55.711 --> 02:58:57.870
So you'll read it and repost it.
This is great.

2763
02:58:58.380 --> 02:59:03.330
So I read it and I just commented back to him.
I said,

2764
02:59:03.780 --> 02:59:07.290
it sounds like you need to start doing Jujitsu

2765
02:59:08.910 --> 02:59:11.640
later.
So there you go.

2766
02:59:11.730 --> 02:59:15.120
Whoever that guy was seemed like a nice enough guy but didn't want to do the

2767
02:59:15.121 --> 02:59:17.580
Jujitsu.
That's that.
So yeah,

2768
02:59:17.610 --> 02:59:21.000
subscribe and don't forget about the warrior can podcast.
Yes sir.
Oh,

2769
02:59:21.001 --> 02:59:25.050
my daughter has a question for the warrior.
Could podcast.
We'll go over it later.

2770
02:59:25.190 --> 02:59:29.580
Okay.
Pass it on to uncle Jake if you would.
But yeah,
so yeah,
that's a good one.

2771
02:59:30.000 --> 02:59:33.650
Warrior can podcast is,
have you ever listened to one?

2772
02:59:33.660 --> 02:59:38.630
Could podcasts where your kids,
it's what it is.
Uh,

2773
02:59:41.280 --> 02:59:44.820
the basic principles of life.

2774
02:59:45.330 --> 02:59:50.160
I try and convey it in a way for kids that they can understand it,

2775
02:59:50.190 --> 02:59:53.700
that they can appreciate it and that they listen to it.
As,
you know,

2776
02:59:53.760 --> 02:59:57.820
I'm always quoting you with my,
with my kids,
like discipline equals freedom.

2777
02:59:57.870 --> 03:00:02.050
Bright,
right?
Do the right thing and then I'll let you do more.

2778
03:00:02.590 --> 03:00:07.290
And you know what?
It doesn't matter who you are as a dad.

2779
03:00:07.350 --> 03:00:10.920
Your kids are not going to listen to you as much as you want them to.

2780
03:00:11.490 --> 03:00:13.980
So it's good if you come at them from another angle.

2781
03:00:14.010 --> 03:00:18.330
The other angle is uncle Jake who can tell them about discipline equals freedom.

2782
03:00:18.720 --> 03:00:22.710
So anyways,
where your kid podcast,
check that out and don't forget about that.

2783
03:00:22.711 --> 03:00:27.711
Warrior kids soap from Irish oaks ranch.com Aiden's making soap as a kid,

2784
03:00:29.640 --> 03:00:32.800

On a rope,
right?
Yeah.

2785
03:00:33.660 --> 03:00:36.660
Five 50 court,
little piece of Para Cord.
That's good.

2786

Then you can watch this complete episode on Youtube.

2790
03:00:52.830 --> 03:00:57.690
You can also see echoes enhanced videos,
you know,

2791
03:00:58.650 --> 03:01:00.040
it's a lot of time and effort into

2792
03:01:00.040 --> 03:01:03.570
<v 7>them,
which means that he puts a lot of time and effort into them.
There you go.</v>

2793

Yell and it,
some of them are good.

2794
03:01:05.920 --> 03:01:10.410
Some of them he puts a little too much time and effort into.
Okay,
cool.
The same.

2795
03:01:10.600 --> 03:01:13.660
Yeah.
Yeah,
I dig it.
What else?

2796
03:01:14.260 --> 03:01:18.130
Psychologic warfare if you,
I mean if you're having issues,

2797
03:01:18.520 --> 03:01:22.240
a lot of issues or just a few issues on the path,
you know,

2798
03:01:22.300 --> 03:01:26.680
moments of weakness where you don't want to get up as early as maybe you think

2799
03:01:26.681 --> 03:01:29.680
you should and you don't feel like it.
That's what it is.

2800
03:01:29.740 --> 03:01:33.100
When you don't feel like it does the little bit of help to push you through any

2801
03:01:33.101 --> 03:01:36.460
moment.
Diet stuff,
wake up,
stuff,
workouts,
skipping workouts,
stuff.

2802
03:01:36.461 --> 03:01:39.040
That was a big one for me back in that day by the way.
Um,

2803
03:01:39.590 --> 03:01:41.770
despite this little scalpel and leg workouts,

2804
03:01:45.210 --> 03:01:49.830
not anymore though,
right?
Not the arms were cutting either.

2805
03:01:50.020 --> 03:01:50.890
So anyway,

2806
03:01:53.380 --> 03:01:57.430

Also some good,

2824
03:03:04.000 --> 03:03:07.780
what would you call the elk bars?
Snack food.

2825
03:03:08.130 --> 03:03:09.250
Healthy snack.

2826
03:03:10.460 --> 03:03:14.960
Even throw the word healthy because the stigma like the cliche like you think

that's the word.
Yeah.

2830
03:03:28.540 --> 03:03:31.930

the dragons that's for younger kids weigh the warrior kid that's for medium aged

2832
03:03:38.741 --> 03:03:43.180
kids.
Mark's mission is the follow on to that.
The new book,

2833
03:03:43.181 --> 03:03:46.810
three of way the warrior kid is coming out,
it's called where there's a will.

2834
03:03:47.680 --> 03:03:51.280
It will be available.
Should be available right now.

2835
03:03:51.310 --> 03:03:56.290
How you liked that for preorder on Amazon discipline equals freedom field
manual.

2836
03:03:57.650 --> 03:03:58.130
Extreme

2837
03:03:58.130 --> 03:04:01.700
<v 0>ownership.
First Book I wrote with my brother Leif Babin.</v>

2838
03:04:02.600 --> 03:04:03.090
<v 1>Okay.</v>

2839
03:04:03.090 --> 03:04:06.450
<v 0>About combat leadership and how you can apply it to your business,</v>

2840
03:04:06.451 --> 03:04:08.370
into your life.
And then the dichotomy of leadership,

2841
03:04:08.371 --> 03:04:11.400
which is the followup to that book,
which is also about leadership,

2842
03:04:11.401 --> 03:04:16.401
but it gets granular on those principles and on it being a balanced leader,

2843
03:04:17.311 --> 03:04:20.520
which is the best kind of leader to be Ashkelon Front.
That's a

2844
03:04:21.260 --> 03:04:24.110
my leadership consultancy and what we do is solve problems through leadership.

2845
03:04:24.111 --> 03:04:28.820
It's me,
Leif,
Babin,
JP Denelle,
Dave Burke.
Good.
Yeah.
Good deal.

2846
03:04:28.821 --> 03:04:29.840
Day Burke Flynn Cochran.

2847
03:04:29.841 --> 03:04:34.220

2848
03:04:34.221 --> 03:04:38.930
really have a nickname.
He,
yeah.
Oh No.
This is a matter of fact on that one.

2849
03:04:39.600 --> 03:04:44.600
A go national in front.com if you want us to come and help you work through

2850
03:04:45.321 --> 03:04:48.590
whatever issues you have in your organization,
that will do it with leadership.

2851
03:04:48.591 --> 03:04:51.350
The muster coming up May 23rd and 24th in Chicago,

2852
03:04:51.351 --> 03:04:55.400
September 19th and 20th in Denver,
December 4th and fifth in Sydney,

2853
03:04:55.640 --> 03:04:56.660
Australia.

2854
03:04:58.070 --> 03:05:01.790
These are leadership conferences,

2855
03:05:02.410 --> 03:05:07.310
events,
gatherings,
musters.
Yeah,
so it's a monster.

2856
03:05:07.340 --> 03:05:11.390
That's what we call it.
We call it the muster and if you want to come to it,

2857
03:05:11.720 --> 03:05:15.080
you got to register pretty quick.
They all,
the ones that we've done,

2858
03:05:15.170 --> 03:05:18.530
these are seven,
eight,
nine this year the all of them have sold out.

2859
03:05:18.620 --> 03:05:22.160
So these are going to sell out as well.
If you want to come get there early,

2860
03:05:22.250 --> 03:05:23.870
I won't be able to help you.

2861
03:05:25.360 --> 03:05:29.650
If you contact me a week prior to the event and say,
Hey,

2862
03:05:29.651 --> 03:05:31.330
I really wanted to go,
can you scale,
you know,

2863
03:05:31.540 --> 03:05:33.790
throw me a couple of tickets and I know you for,

2864
03:05:33.880 --> 03:05:38.650
I went to high school with you or whatever.
I can't help you.
You can't calm.

2865
03:05:39.070 --> 03:05:41.470
Don't be mad at me then.
Yeah.
Excellent.

2866
03:05:44.260 --> 03:05:45.100
BF on mine.

2867
03:05:46.220 --> 03:05:50.990
That is our online training for leadership for people that can't come to the

2868
03:05:50.991 --> 03:05:55.991
monster or do you got a big company with 28,000 employees and you want them all

2869
03:05:56.031 --> 03:05:59.720
to get trained in the leadership principles that we teach at echelon front.

2870
03:05:59.721 --> 03:06:04.721
Go to eff online.com and you can get your whole organization aligned and running

2871
03:06:06.861 --> 03:06:10.130
in the right direction.
And we've got f Overwatch as well.

2872
03:06:10.700 --> 03:06:15.700
And what we're doing with the f Overwatch is taking proven leaders from SPEC ops

2873
03:06:16.761 --> 03:06:21.590
and from combat aviation and putting them into civilian jobs,

2874
03:06:21.620 --> 03:06:25.340
civilian sector leadership and don't always think you got to hire somebody that

2875
03:06:25.341 --> 03:06:28.160
knows everything technical about the situation.

2876
03:06:29.740 --> 03:06:31.810
Hire someone for their leadership capability.

2877
03:06:31.811 --> 03:06:35.020
It's easier to teach them the industry than it is to teach someone in
leadership.

2878
03:06:35.021 --> 03:06:37.570
So e f overwatch.com that's what you need.

2879
03:06:37.600 --> 03:06:42.070
It's you need leadership and if you want to connect with Ron,

2880
03:06:43.120 --> 03:06:44.230
he's on the Inter webs.

2881
03:06:44.410 --> 03:06:48.160
He's a kind of young on the interwebs.

2882
03:06:49.770 --> 03:06:52.050
You're not super advanced.

2883
03:06:53.340 --> 03:06:56.100
I'm trying to to,
to learn,
especially

2884
03:06:56.100 --> 03:06:59.810
<v 4>with Instagram.
And so I'm trying to distill it,</v>

2885
03:06:59.811 --> 03:07:02.190
dip my toes into that and the toes are being yet

2886
03:07:03.690 --> 03:07:05.850
get to get that connection with the people who,

2887
03:07:05.880 --> 03:07:07.830
who feel connected to the story at all or,

2888
03:07:08.260 --> 03:07:12.040
<v 0>yeah,
it's awesome.
Uh,
if you do go on Twitter,</v>

2889
03:07:13.060 --> 03:07:17.680
it's Ron underscore three nine six for Instagram,

2890
03:07:17.710 --> 03:07:22.090
which apparently is Ron's.
Ron is going to be the Graham.
He's in the gram.

2891
03:07:22.180 --> 03:07:26.620
That's your main one.
That's,
that's my focus.
That's your focus.
Okay.

2892
03:07:26.621 --> 03:07:31.570
It's got the mission focus and that is Raun underscore.
Sure.
S,
h.

2893
03:07:31.571 --> 03:07:33.550
U.
R.
E.

2894
03:07:34.840 --> 03:07:39.640

uh,
Echo Charles and I are on those as well.

2895
03:07:39.641 --> 03:07:41.140
And we're also on

2896
03:07:43.330 --> 03:07:48.280

echo is adequate.

2897
03:07:48.281 --> 03:07:51.940
Charles and I am at Jockowillink Echo.

No,

2898
03:07:53.370 --> 03:07:57.600
<v 4>thank you Ron.
You're the man.
Ron,
congratulations.
Well,</v>

2899
03:07:58.680 --> 03:08:03.040
any closing thoughts are on,
so again,
thank you guys so much for having me

2900
03:08:05.310 --> 03:08:06.143
today.
Um,

2901
03:08:06.810 --> 03:08:10.830
whenever I come to talk about myself,

2902
03:08:10.831 --> 03:08:15.540
I get name,
love talking about myself,

2903
03:08:15.541 --> 03:08:20.520
like getting most SF guys do.
I'd rather,
you know,
my,
my wife says that,
uh,

2904
03:08:21.900 --> 03:08:26.210
you know,
I,
I,
I became a green baret in,
it's the quiet professional,
the,
you know,

2905
03:08:27.260 --> 03:08:29.700
you know,
you just got you to the mission and you can talk about it.

2906
03:08:30.300 --> 03:08:33.210
And then I'm moving over to the secret service,
which is,
you know,

2907
03:08:33.340 --> 03:08:36.360
it has that kind of tagline like standing on the sidelines of history.
Like,

2908
03:08:36.870 --> 03:08:39.390
I want to do cool things.
I want to be there,

2909
03:08:39.391 --> 03:08:44.391
but I never want anybody the talk about me or look at me or do any of that.

2910
03:08:45.810 --> 03:08:46.890
Um,
but I,

2911
03:08:46.891 --> 03:08:51.891
I appreciate the chance to come here today because we know when I got the,

2912
03:08:52.640 --> 03:08:55.590
the metal,
you know,

2913
03:08:55.591 --> 03:09:00.591
as part of processing it and trying to figure out what did I want to do with it.

2914
03:09:01.500 --> 03:09:03.810
Um,
you know,

2915
03:09:04.740 --> 03:09:07.530
like riding a right now from the global war on terrorism,

2916
03:09:07.531 --> 03:09:12.030
we've been fighting for 17 straight years,
like green berets.

2917
03:09:12.630 --> 03:09:15.750
You know,
that's,
that's where my heart is.
Like they've been just out there,

2918
03:09:15.751 --> 03:09:17.420
get it on the entire time.
I'm,

2919
03:09:18.570 --> 03:09:23.570
it's mind boggling to me that I am the only living recipient right now

2920
03:09:25.230 --> 03:09:29.400
representing that group.
Robbie Miller,
who was in Alpha three,
three,

2921
03:09:29.401 --> 03:09:33.140
he was on the same deployment is me.
He won the medal of honor,
um,

2922
03:09:33.180 --> 03:09:37.170
in January of 2008,
uh,
barely taking the fight to the enemy,

2923
03:09:37.200 --> 03:09:42.180
but unfortunately he was killed.
He was the first Green Brae in this war.

2924
03:09:42.181 --> 03:09:43.290
And,
and now I'm a second,

2925
03:09:43.291 --> 03:09:48.030
but I'm the first two can actually get out there and share.

2926
03:09:48.810 --> 03:09:52.190
I share my story,
not so you can be like,
hey,
Ron's awesome.

2927
03:09:52.210 --> 03:09:57.210
Like Ron's just another dude on a team who had an okay day in a bat and a

2928
03:09:58.060 --> 03:10:00.820
horrible day,
but store.

2929
03:10:00.850 --> 03:10:05.440
So I can tell people that stories like that are going on constantly.
And

2930
03:10:07.120 --> 03:10:10.360
you know,
I'm just,
I'm,
I'm here to represent those guys who

2931
03:10:11.400 --> 03:10:12.890
<v 6>don't care.
Do you,</v>

2932
03:10:14.690 --> 03:10:18.010
<v 4>you know,
you could give him,
give him an award,
not giving him an award,</v>

2933
03:10:18.030 --> 03:10:20.920
give him a pat on the back.
They don't care.
They just,

2934
03:10:20.950 --> 03:10:23.320
they believe in the mission.
They're out there doing the mission,

2935
03:10:23.770 --> 03:10:28.770
they're missing birthdays and anniversaries and all those things for this

2936
03:10:30.491 --> 03:10:32.280
country.
And you know,

2937
03:10:32.380 --> 03:10:36.220
that's why I'm here is just to remind people about those guys,

2938
03:10:36.490 --> 03:10:37.540
not so much myself

2939
03:10:38.370 --> 03:10:43.140
<v 6>and
you know,
to be able to,
you know,</v>

2940
03:10:43.500 --> 03:10:48.480
<v 4>just share a little bit of that story.
And then,
you know,
also to,
you know,</v>

2941
03:10:49.440 --> 03:10:54.090
say thanks to my family for being so supportive.
It's,

2942
03:10:55.740 --> 03:10:59.910
you know,
I mean I'm,
you know,

2943
03:11:00.120 --> 03:11:03.000
I got up metal cause I was,
you know,
taking care of other people.

2944
03:11:03.001 --> 03:11:07.110
But I have a huge support structure behind me.
My wife,
Miranda,

2945
03:11:08.030 --> 03:11:08.863
<v 6>like I said,</v>

2946
03:11:11.480 --> 03:11:14.730
<v 4>was quizzing me through the Q course elsewhere.</v>

2947
03:11:15.390 --> 03:11:19.290
Maybe not our first date,
but by like week two or three and like,
okay,

2948
03:11:19.291 --> 03:11:22.470
you're in the circle now,
now you got to help me cause I can't give up a whole,

2949
03:11:22.740 --> 03:11:25.920
I want to see you for a weekend but I can't give up a whole weekend.

2950
03:11:25.980 --> 03:11:29.670
And that's that.
He,
so just the support that,
um,

2951
03:11:29.880 --> 03:11:34.500
she's given from then to now to,
you know,

2952
03:11:34.710 --> 03:11:36.870
having a baby or being pregnant with,

2953
03:11:37.200 --> 03:11:41.750
with some green baret he was overseas,
he comes back,
sees the baby born like,

2954
03:11:41.760 --> 03:11:45.570
all right,
good luck with that kid.
I got to go back and take care of people.

2955
03:11:45.571 --> 03:11:49.640
So the amount of support that I've had there and the,

2956
03:11:49.660 --> 03:11:53.340
my kids just putting up with all this stuff to just be able to say thanks to

2957
03:11:53.341 --> 03:11:55.770
them on a bigger front.
I appreciate that.

2958
03:11:57.100 --> 03:11:59.990
<v 6>And
you know,
I</v>

2959
03:12:01.220 --> 03:12:04.440
<v 4>touch on it a little bit with,
with my cancer story.
Um,</v>

2960
03:12:04.670 --> 03:12:07.820
I definitely don't want to be,

2961
03:12:09.410 --> 03:12:14.090
I don't want it to be some like
sad story.
Like,
Oh,

2962
03:12:14.091 --> 03:12:17.090
this guy has sex to be him or anything.

2963
03:12:17.340 --> 03:12:20.690
I just share it just because I know there were other people out there who are

2964
03:12:21.560 --> 03:12:26.150
getting diagnosed with cancer and they're getting those phone calls.

2965
03:12:26.151 --> 03:12:29.570
And I remember that.
I remember that first call I got where he was like,

2966
03:12:31.700 --> 03:12:34.100
you know,
there's nothing you can do today.

2967
03:12:34.610 --> 03:12:37.710
And he meant like it was like a Friday afternoon.

2968
03:12:37.730 --> 03:12:42.140
I just found out the day before and it's going to the weekend.
But that,
that,

2969
03:12:43.550 --> 03:12:44.330
<v 6>that</v>

2970
03:12:44.330 --> 03:12:47.780
<v 4>crushed of that.
Well there's nothing you can do.
Like what do you mean?
And so,</v>

2971
03:12:48.800 --> 03:12:52.910
you know,
the,
if I can just put out that story,
there's always hope.

2972
03:12:52.911 --> 03:12:56.770
There's always more you can do.
And you know,

2973
03:12:56.780 --> 03:13:01.780
the cancer fight is not like combat where you get to go punch somebody in the

2974
03:13:01.791 --> 03:13:03.680
face or shoot somebody in the face and,

2975
03:13:03.770 --> 03:13:07.940
and have that like the cancer fight is,

2976
03:13:08.390 --> 03:13:12.650
you know,
getting up and eating when you don't want to eat.

2977
03:13:12.651 --> 03:13:17.060
And so last thing in the world you want to do or you got to work out well it's

2978
03:13:17.420 --> 03:13:22.420
just go for a walk,
you know,
like just,
just those things.
So I just want to,

2979
03:13:22.530 --> 03:13:25.880
you know,
have a moment to be able to anybody who's being affected by that,

2980
03:13:26.510 --> 03:13:30.980
just say,
you know,
you're,
you're not allowed.
It's tough.
It sucks.

2981
03:13:32.360 --> 03:13:36.610
However you got there,
it doesn't matter.
Don't worry about.
I don't,

2982
03:13:36.620 --> 03:13:41.450
I try not to worry for myself why I got it.
Um,
but it's just,

2983
03:13:41.451 --> 03:13:43.730
it's,
it's just the next challenge.

2984
03:13:43.940 --> 03:13:47.210
Keep putting one foot in front of the other and uh,

2985
03:13:49.370 --> 03:13:50.203
yeah,
that's life.

2986
03:13:52.860 --> 03:13:57.840
<v 0>Awesome man.
Well,
um,
once again,
uh,
thanks.
Thanks for coming on man.</v>

2987
03:13:57.841 --> 03:13:59.550
It's been awesome.
Meet you and thanks to Zack,

2988
03:13:59.551 --> 03:14:02.400
you're buddy Zack who kind of linked us up and it was cool that he reached out

2989
03:14:02.401 --> 03:14:05.250
to me and it took us a long time to make this happen with everything that's

2990
03:14:05.251 --> 03:14:08.040
going on in your world.
And uh,
I'm glad we were able to do it.

2991
03:14:08.041 --> 03:14:10.530
So thanks for coming on and Oh,
absolutely.
My pleasure.

2992
03:14:10.980 --> 03:14:15.270
Obviously thanks for your service and your sacrifice.

2993
03:14:15.420 --> 03:14:20.100
For what you did for this country and you know,

2994
03:14:20.101 --> 03:14:23.190
not just for what you did for the country while you were in the military while

2995
03:14:23.191 --> 03:14:26.250
you were in the secret service,
but also right now,

2996
03:14:26.610 --> 03:14:29.850
setting an example for everyone,

2997
03:14:29.940 --> 03:14:32.010
for everyone that's out there for me,

2998
03:14:32.011 --> 03:14:36.810
for everyone to follow and know that we can step up our game,

2999
03:14:36.960 --> 03:14:38.490
that we can go on,

3000
03:14:38.640 --> 03:14:43.640
we can do better and we can fight harder and that's what I see when I see you.

3001
03:14:43.801 --> 03:14:46.830
And uh,
thanks for doing that for me and for everyone else and

3002
03:14:48.000 --> 03:14:48.500
<v 1>okay,</v>

3003
03:14:48.500 --> 03:14:53.500
<v 0>obviously thanks to everyone else out there in uniform that is defending our</v>

3004
03:14:55.161 --> 03:15:00.110
flag and our country to those that are serving to those that have served.

3005
03:15:00.680 --> 03:15:02.540
Thanks to all of you out there.

3006
03:15:02.990 --> 03:15:07.520
Thanks to the police and law enforcement,
firefighters,
paramedics,

3007
03:15:07.640 --> 03:15:12.530
EMT,
dispatchers,
correctional officers,

3008
03:15:13.160 --> 03:15:17.060
border patrol,
secret service,

3009
03:15:17.940 --> 03:15:22.340
first time mentioned for the secret service and all the other first responders.

3010
03:15:22.610 --> 03:15:26.570
Thanks for keeping us safe here at home and for everyone else out there,

3011
03:15:28.840 --> 03:15:30.460
remember that.

3012
03:15:31.800 --> 03:15:32.200
<v 1>Okay,</v>

3013
03:15:32.200 --> 03:15:33.580
<v 0>you might have to fight uphill.</v>

3014
03:15:34.780 --> 03:15:39.400
You might have to fight against a hardened enemy that has more guns and more

3015
03:15:39.401 --> 03:15:43.980
people than you.
And even in those situations,

3016
03:15:46.310 --> 03:15:51.310
remember the path of Ron Shirt and the of special forces,

3017
03:15:51.810 --> 03:15:55.890
Oda?
Three,

03:16:01.520 --> 03:16:02.330
<v 1>okay.</v>

3020
03:16:02.330 --> 03:16:03.680
<v 0>Remember to pick up that weapon.</v>

3021
03:16:03.681 --> 03:16:08.630
Remember to put one foot in front of the other and remember to keep getting

3022
03:16:08.631 --> 03:16:09.464
after it.

3023
03:16:10.470 --> 03:16:11.090
<v 1>Okay.</v>

3024
03:16:11.090 --> 03:16:15.890
<v 0>And until next time,
this is Ron [inaudible] and echo and Jocko</v>

3025
03:16:17.390 --> 03:16:17.750
