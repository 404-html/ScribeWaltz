00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.410
Jocko,
the military taught me to never apologize,
speaking of which,

2
00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:06.450
because it's a sign of weakness,

3
00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:10.890
had a conversation with a coworker who says that extreme ownership is the same

4
00:00:10.891 --> 00:00:14.790
as apologizing.
So,
uh,
first of all,

5
00:00:14.791 --> 00:00:19.791
no apologizing is actually not a sign of weakness.

6
00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.740
And whoever was putting that out,

7
00:00:22.741 --> 00:00:27.741
whoever taught that was actually too insecure about themselves and their

8
00:00:27.841 --> 00:00:32.841
leadership capability to admit when they were wrong or made a mistake and,

9
00:00:32.881 --> 00:00:37.830
and really insecure about a lot of other things,
most likely people,

10
00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.760
it's actually the opposite.
People that can't admit their mistakes are weak

11
00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.240
and people that can't apologize when they screw up our week,

12
00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:49.283
they're scared.

13
00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.740
They're scared to take ownership and they're protective of their ego.

14
00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:56.250
Now that being said,

15
00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.500
extreme ownership is not the same as apologizing,
but there definitely similar,

16
00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:02.761
you know,

17
00:01:02.761 --> 00:01:04.920
extreme ownership means you're admitting that there's some kind of a problem and

18
00:01:04.921 --> 00:01:08.400
you're taking ownership of that problem.
If it's something that you did wrong,

19
00:01:08.401 --> 00:01:11.970
then you're,
you're taking ownership of that mistake.
The key part,

20
00:01:11.971 --> 00:01:15.150
as you already said,
is not that you're just owning the problem,

21
00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.220
you're actually solving the problem.

22
00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.690
And Yeah,
if you screw something up or you make a mistake,

23
00:01:24.691 --> 00:01:27.510
then apologize for it,
apologize for your shortfalls,

24
00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.410
and then you can move forward.
Uh,
Sarah Armstrong,

25
00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.800
she's set a couple of times on Twitter when I'm said like,
yeah,
say you're sorry.

26
00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:40.140
She said ask for forgiveness too.
I haven't,
I haven't tried that one out,

27
00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.660
but she seems to see,
seems to think that that is another,
and you,

28
00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.080
when she says things,
I listened to her.
She's smart.
I don't look,

29
00:01:47.081 --> 00:01:50.220
we talked about that.
I think it might've been Sarah Armstrong.
Oh wait,

30
00:01:50.221 --> 00:01:52.350
she said that a long time ago.
Long.
Long.
Okay.
Yeah.

31
00:01:52.351 --> 00:01:56.310
You see we talked about this before and here's my take on that one.
Say it again.

32
00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.790
I'm not 100% on that one.
Well,
you can ask for forgiveness.
This is why.
Yeah,

33
00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.090
because it's this.
If someone,
I dig it as far as like doing it,

34
00:02:06.091 --> 00:02:08.910
it feels like it does feel like a,
like a humble kind of approach,

35
00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.650
but it can be taken like this.

36
00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:15.510
So I would take it and I don't think I'd be wrong most of the time where when

37
00:02:15.511 --> 00:02:19.950
it's like,
okay,
I'm,
I'm sorry,
you know,
I'm,
I'm,

38
00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:23.930
I messed up,
it's all me or whatever.
Right?
So it's almost like he,

39
00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:27.870
you throw the ball in their court to be the bad guy.

40
00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:31.800
It's kind of like,
so it's a,
it's almost like a guaranteed way to get forgiven.

41
00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:35.040
That's what it is.
And it's kind of like,
I know that.
So it was like,

42
00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:37.500
this is me strong arming forgiveness from you.

43
00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:40.830
It's like shaming you into forgiving us.
So you're saying if you're like,

44
00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:44.930
if I say,
Hey,
echo,
I'm really sorry about this.
Do you forgive me?
Yeah.

45
00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:48.220
Oh,
I got to say yes.
Well,
no,

46
00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:52.290
I'm imposing on posing strong arming them.
It's interesting.

47
00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:54.870
It's just to get some feed bumps or Sarah,
we'll give you some feedback.

48
00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:59.010
It's subtle,
but it,
and I'm saying really it's more prevalent,

49
00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:02.360
I don't think have ever asked for a person's forgiveness.
I've said that.

50
00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:03.970
I've said so,
you know,
sorry,

51
00:03:03.971 --> 00:03:06.160
and apologize for all kinds of stupid things that have done,

52
00:03:06.161 --> 00:03:08.860
but I don't think I've ever asked for forgiveness.

53
00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:13.870
Maybe if this was something really big.
Yeah,
but even then,
man,

54
00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:17.290
yeah,
that's a tough one.
I am sure she has a little great reason behind it.

55
00:03:17.291 --> 00:03:22.291
We'll have to get further explanations from Sarah because I considered like

56
00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:27.460
saying that in some minor situation,
whatever,
and then I'm like,
wait.

57
00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:32.350
In minor situations,
it's too much like,
you know,
a show to play,
man,
I'm sorry,

58
00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:37.570
will you forgive me?
Like,
no.
Like this is a little too much.
It's like saying,

59
00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.750
Hey,
I know,
you know,
I know I made you bad,
or something like that.

60
00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:44.140
I know I made you mad and I'm sorry.
You know,
whatever.
Are you still mad?

61
00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:47.620
It's kind of like that because if you say,
yeah,
I'm still mad.

62
00:03:47.621 --> 00:03:50.200
It's kind of like flight.
Hey,
I said my piece,

63
00:03:50.201 --> 00:03:53.620
you chose not to be met or you chose to continue to be mad.

64
00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:58.630
That's your problem kind of thing.
It's like,
do you please forgive me?

65
00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:03.130
Please forgive me.
Like,
what kind of a dick doesn't forgive someone.
You know?

66
00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:06.940
It's kind of like that and they're bringing that,
so it's like a little strong.

67
00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:09.010
I said,
we'll get feedback where it's,
it's an interesting,

68
00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:10.150
we'll get feedback from Sara,
I'm sure.

69
00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:14.410
It's interesting to think that there's people out there and you know,

70
00:04:14.411 --> 00:04:17.140
they're out there that like,
hey,
don't apologize.
It's a sign of weakness.

71
00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:21.910
It's just being dumb.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Here's,

72
00:04:21.911 --> 00:04:25.760
here's the advice for today.
Don't be dumb.
Yeah.
It's kind of goes the,

73
00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:29.740
the apologizing and taking extreme more ownership.
I say nuts,
similar.

74
00:04:29.741 --> 00:04:32.080
I think there's a big overlap there.
Oh,
there's huge,

75
00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:35.570
I didn't say there were not similar.
Oh,
no,
no,
not that.
Not the same thing.
Sorry.

76
00:04:35.571 --> 00:04:39.920
So,
yeah,
they're not,
they're not the same thing.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
It's like,
um,

77
00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:43.120
well back to the thing when you were like,
Yo,
if you don't apologize,

78
00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:46.660
that's weak or whatever,
that's kind of like the guy who says like,
Hey,

79
00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:51.010
this is how I am.
Take it or leave it kind of thing.
Yeah.
I mean,

80
00:04:51.011 --> 00:04:52.900
if they're a dick,
you know,
or something like that.
And they're like,

81
00:04:52.901 --> 00:04:55.390
take it or leave it.
Some people love me,
some people hate me.
It's kind of thing.

82
00:04:55.391 --> 00:04:58.360
And by that doesn't bother you,
that people hate you because of how you are,

83
00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:02.730
you know,
kind of thing.
It's going to,
yeah.
You know?
So it's kind of weird.
I mean,

84
00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:05.050
yeah.
Ticket,
you know,
be you,
for sure.
But,
um,

85
00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:08.140
I think that's something that's not nothing.
If people hate you.
