00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:10.930
<v Speaker 1>Welcome to the channel and my name is </v>
<v Speaker 1>Paul.</v>

2
00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:11.823
<v Speaker 1>Today I'm going to talk about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Swahili language or Kiswahili as it's </v>

3
00:00:15.581 --> 00:00:17.350
<v Speaker 1>called in Swahili,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and by the way,</v>

4
00:00:17.351 --> 00:00:21.460
<v Speaker 1>Keith is a prefix that means language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Swahili is one of the most widely spoken</v>

5
00:00:21.461 --> 00:00:22.294
<v Speaker 1>languages in Africa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if we only consider languages that </v>

6
00:00:24.281 --> 00:00:27.070
<v Speaker 1>are native to Africa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then it is the most widely spoken.</v>

7
00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:30.370
<v Speaker 1>It is widely spoken over a wide area of </v>
<v Speaker 1>east Africa.</v>

8
00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:33.490
<v Speaker 1>The number of native speakers of Swahili</v>
<v Speaker 1>is actually rather small,</v>

9
00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:34.353
<v Speaker 1>somewhere between five and 15 million,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it is widely spoken as a Lingua </v>

10
00:00:37.751 --> 00:00:40.780
<v Speaker 1>Franca that unites the linguistically </v>
<v Speaker 1>diverse population.</v>

11
00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:41.823
<v Speaker 1>Estimates vary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the total number of proficient </v>

12
00:00:43.301 --> 00:00:44.134
<v Speaker 1>speakers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we include second language and third </v>

13
00:00:45.611 --> 00:00:49.120
<v Speaker 1>language speakers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>could be as high as $150 million or even</v>

14
00:00:49.121 --> 00:00:51.520
<v Speaker 1>more Swahili,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is an official language in Kenya,</v>

15
00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:55.060
<v Speaker 1>Tanzania,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uganda and Democratic Republic of Congo,</v>

16
00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:57.850
<v Speaker 1>and it's spoken in other countries like </v>
<v Speaker 1>Rwanda and Burundi.</v>

17
00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:01.250
<v Speaker 1>The closely related Korean language </v>
<v Speaker 1>spoken in Comoros.</v>

18
00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:03.760
<v Speaker 1>There's also sometimes considered a </v>
<v Speaker 1>dialect of Swahili.</v>

19
00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:06.400
<v Speaker 1>Chances are that you know a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 1>of Swahili already,</v>

20
00:01:06.401 --> 00:01:07.234
<v Speaker 1>whether you know it or not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you've seen the Disney movie lion </v>

21
00:01:09.251 --> 00:01:10.870
<v Speaker 1>king,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you know the name Simba.</v>

22
00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:14.590
<v Speaker 1>Simba means lion in Swahili,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and maybe you remember Nala,</v>

23
00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:17.730
<v Speaker 1>Nala means gift in Swahili.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then there's roughly d,</v>

24
00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:21.610
<v Speaker 1>Rafiki means friend in Swahili,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and of course there's Puma.</v>

25
00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:25.450
<v Speaker 1>Puma means stupid in Swahili,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and of course there's Hakuna Matata.</v>

26
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.150
<v Speaker 1>Tata means no worries in Swahili,</v>

27
00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.240
<v Speaker 2>Simba,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nala,</v>

28
00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:32.430
<v Speaker 2>Rafiki,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Aquanaut,</v>

29
00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:33.433
<v Speaker 2>my dad,</v>

30
00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:35.343
<v Speaker 1>Swahili is one of the two languages </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a traditional branch of the </v>

31
00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:39.663
<v Speaker 1>Nigeria Congo language family,</v>
<v Speaker 1>throw around $250 into languages </v>

32
00:01:42.011 --> 00:01:44.950
<v Speaker 1>depending on what we consider our </v>
<v Speaker 1>language versus a dialect.</v>

33
00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:48.790
<v Speaker 1>The history of Swahili is somewhat </v>
<v Speaker 1>unclear,</v>

34
00:01:48.791 --> 00:01:49.624
<v Speaker 1>but it originally developed as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>language of coastal areas of Kenya and </v>

35
00:01:52.301 --> 00:01:53.134
<v Speaker 1>Tanzania.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fishermen spread the language to nearby </v>

36
00:01:55.061 --> 00:01:57.220
<v Speaker 1>islands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then over the following centuries,</v>

37
00:01:57.221 --> 00:02:00.730
<v Speaker 1>traders from these islands spread the </v>
<v Speaker 1>language to a larger area of the coast.</v>

38
00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:01.623
<v Speaker 1>Today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this coastal region stretching from </v>

39
00:02:02.651 --> 00:02:03.484
<v Speaker 1>southern Somalia all the way down to </v>
<v Speaker 1>northern Mozambique is where most of </v>

40
00:02:06.011 --> 00:02:07.660
<v Speaker 1>Swahili native speakers are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Found.</v>

41
00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:11.740
<v Speaker 1>The areas where Swahili is spoken had a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of interaction with foreign traders,</v>

42
00:02:11.741 --> 00:02:14.800
<v Speaker 1>particularly those from the Middle East,</v>
<v Speaker 1>throughout the Middle Ages.</v>

43
00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:17.730
<v Speaker 1>One of the main commodities the traders </v>
<v Speaker 1>were seeking was close,</v>

44
00:02:17.731 --> 00:02:20.170
<v Speaker 1>so person in Arab traders established </v>
<v Speaker 1>cloves,</v>

45
00:02:20.171 --> 00:02:21.004
<v Speaker 1>farms in Zanzibar archipelago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they also established trading </v>

46
00:02:23.531 --> 00:02:24.364
<v Speaker 1>settlements along the mainland coast </v>
<v Speaker 1>with both foreign traders and local </v>

47
00:02:27.311 --> 00:02:30.730
<v Speaker 1>African Swahili speaking trader,</v>
<v Speaker 1>settling along the new trade route,</v>

48
00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:32.890
<v Speaker 1>Swahili absorbed many foreign loan </v>
<v Speaker 1>words,</v>

49
00:02:32.891 --> 00:02:34.300
<v Speaker 1>especially from Arabic.</v>

50
00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:36.990
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the name of the language itself while he</v>

51
00:02:36.991 --> 00:02:38.350
<v Speaker 1>lead,</v>
<v Speaker 1>comes from Arabic.</v>

52
00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:41.800
<v Speaker 1>The Arabic word for Kostas side and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>plural form is so,</v>

53
00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:45.630
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so with the prefix key key Swahili means</v>

54
00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:48.130
<v Speaker 1>the language of the coasts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In large part,</v>

55
00:02:48.131 --> 00:02:48.964
<v Speaker 1>this interaction between foreign Muslim </v>
<v Speaker 1>traders and local Africans is what made </v>

56
00:02:52.181 --> 00:02:53.014
<v Speaker 1>the Swahili language what it is today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a Bantu language with a large number of </v>

57
00:02:56.651 --> 00:02:59.110
<v Speaker 1>loan words from other languages,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially Arabic,</v>

58
00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:00.003
<v Speaker 1>but also Persian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Malaya and other languages to contact </v>

59
00:03:02.681 --> 00:03:05.710
<v Speaker 1>with European colonial powers also </v>
<v Speaker 1>influenced Swahili.</v>

60
00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:09.160
<v Speaker 1>Portugal began establishing colonies in </v>
<v Speaker 1>East Africa and 15,</v>

61
00:03:09.161 --> 00:03:10.110
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>five ce,</v>

62
00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:13.570
<v Speaker 1>including in Zanzibar and along the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Kenyan intensity and coasts.</v>

63
00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:15.453
<v Speaker 1>And as you might predict,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this led to the adoption of some </v>

64
00:03:17.081 --> 00:03:21.790
<v Speaker 1>Portuguese vocabulary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but by about 1730 ce Omani,</v>

65
00:03:21.791 --> 00:03:22.624
<v Speaker 1>Arabs have retaken that region from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Portuguese and reestablished control </v>

66
00:03:25.511 --> 00:03:26.344
<v Speaker 1>over it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Around that time in the early 18th </v>

67
00:03:27.701 --> 00:03:30.340
<v Speaker 1>century,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Swahili spread further inland with Arab,</v>

68
00:03:30.341 --> 00:03:32.290
<v Speaker 1>ivory and slave trade caravans.</v>

69
00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:33.243
<v Speaker 1>This brought Swahili to more inland </v>
<v Speaker 1>areas of Kenya and Tanzania to the </v>

70
00:03:35.951 --> 00:03:37.990
<v Speaker 1>eastern part of Congo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>northern Uganda,</v>

71
00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:41.140
<v Speaker 1>and Rwanda and Burundi in the mid 18th </v>
<v Speaker 1>century.</v>

72
00:03:41.141 --> 00:03:43.960
<v Speaker 1>The British and the Germans began </v>
<v Speaker 1>colonizing the area.</v>

73
00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:48.250
<v Speaker 1>Germany took Tanganyika or modern day </v>
<v Speaker 1>Tanzania as a colony in 18,</v>

74
00:03:48.251 --> 00:03:49.084
<v Speaker 1>86.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the British took control of Kenya </v>

75
00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:54.520
<v Speaker 1>then called the East Africa protectorate</v>
<v Speaker 1>in 1895.</v>

76
00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:55.623
<v Speaker 1>And they both encouraged the use of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Swahili as a national language to unite </v>

77
00:03:58.301 --> 00:04:00.820
<v Speaker 1>the population which spoke dozens of </v>
<v Speaker 1>different languages.</v>

78
00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:04.140
<v Speaker 1>Germany made Swahili,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the official end administrative language</v>

79
00:04:04.141 --> 00:04:06.460
<v Speaker 1>and Tanganyika.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While the British made English.</v>

80
00:04:06.461 --> 00:04:09.040
<v Speaker 1>The official language at the highest </v>
<v Speaker 1>levels in Kenya.</v>

81
00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:12.820
<v Speaker 1>English was the language for National </v>
<v Speaker 1>Administration and for higher education,</v>

82
00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:13.743
<v Speaker 1>but Swahili was made the language for </v>
<v Speaker 1>local administration and for primary </v>

83
00:04:16.931 --> 00:04:19.630
<v Speaker 1>education in order to help spread the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Swahili language.</v>

84
00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:22.090
<v Speaker 1>It needed to be standardized,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so in 1928,</v>

85
00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:22.953
<v Speaker 1>a conference was called for this purpose</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the dialect of Zanzibar was chosen </v>

86
00:04:26.051 --> 00:04:26.884
<v Speaker 1>as the basis for the standard language,</v>
<v Speaker 1>its status as an official language or </v>

87
00:04:29.951 --> 00:04:30.784
<v Speaker 1>national language as well as the </v>
<v Speaker 1>language of education has made Swahili </v>

88
00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:37.960
<v Speaker 1>widely spoken as a second language or </v>
<v Speaker 1>third language in Kenya and Tanzania and</v>

89
00:04:37.961 --> 00:04:40.450
<v Speaker 1>in the eastern part of the Democratic </v>
<v Speaker 1>Republic of Congo.</v>

90
00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:41.433
<v Speaker 1>In Tanzania.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Around 80 percent of the people can </v>

91
00:04:42.821 --> 00:04:43.654
<v Speaker 1>speak it and amongst the younger </v>
<v Speaker 1>generations it is becoming more widely </v>

92
00:04:46.121 --> 00:04:46.954
<v Speaker 1>spoken as a native language,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially in the urban areas and the </v>

93
00:04:49.391 --> 00:04:50.920
<v Speaker 1>situation is similar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In Kenya,</v>

94
00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:52.023
<v Speaker 1>in the Democratic Republic of Congo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's most widely spoken in the eastern </v>

95
00:04:54.851 --> 00:04:55.684
<v Speaker 1>part of the country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in total around 50 percent of the </v>

96
00:04:57.521 --> 00:04:59.410
<v Speaker 1>population are proficient in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>language.</v>

97
00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:03.310
<v Speaker 1>It is also fairly widely spoken in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Rwanda and Burundi and to some extent in</v>

98
00:05:03.311 --> 00:05:06.070
<v Speaker 1>Uganda as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But even though Swahili has been made an</v>

99
00:05:06.071 --> 00:05:09.640
<v Speaker 1>official language in Uganda and it is </v>
<v Speaker 1>compulsory to learn in schools.</v>

100
00:05:09.641 --> 00:05:10.474
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people are not interested in </v>
<v Speaker 1>learning it and a lot of schools have </v>

101
00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:15.070
<v Speaker 1>actually been teaching it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At least that's what I hear.</v>

102
00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:18.160
<v Speaker 1>So what is Swahili like orthography?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

103
00:05:18.161 --> 00:05:20.020
<v Speaker 1>it used to be written in the Arabic </v>
<v Speaker 1>script,</v>

104
00:05:20.021 --> 00:05:22.150
<v Speaker 1>but because of European colonial </v>
<v Speaker 1>influence,</v>

105
00:05:22.151 --> 00:05:22.984
<v Speaker 1>it is now written in the Latin script </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's written phonetically so that </v>

106
00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:28.210
<v Speaker 1>each letter represents just one sound in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the language.</v>

107
00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:29.463
<v Speaker 1>Phonology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Swahili has five vowel sounds which are </v>

108
00:05:31.511 --> 00:05:35.200
<v Speaker 1>always fully pronounced and not reduced.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are no diphthongs.</v>

109
00:05:35.201 --> 00:05:36.034
<v Speaker 1>That means that there are no combination</v>
<v Speaker 1>of vowels pronounced as a single </v>

110
00:05:38.381 --> 00:05:42.970
<v Speaker 1>syllable like I or owl,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or if you see two vowels side by side,</v>

111
00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.010
<v Speaker 1>they have to be pronounced as separate </v>
<v Speaker 1>syllables.</v>

112
00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:47.830
<v Speaker 1>This makes the phonology generally quite</v>
<v Speaker 1>easy to learn,</v>

113
00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:50.920
<v Speaker 1>and all Swahili consonants have English </v>
<v Speaker 1>equivalents,</v>

114
00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:52.053
<v Speaker 1>but there are some things to be careful </v>
<v Speaker 1>of to nasal consonants can come before </v>

115
00:05:55.391 --> 00:05:58.280
<v Speaker 1>other consonants with no vowel in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

116
00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:00.473
<v Speaker 1>means child boy means dog means banana.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Learning how to pronounce these sounds </v>

117
00:06:06.891 --> 00:06:08.660
<v Speaker 1>together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe a challenge at first.</v>

118
00:06:08.661 --> 00:06:11.210
<v Speaker 1>If you've never spoken the language with</v>
<v Speaker 1>that feature before.</v>

119
00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:15.020
<v Speaker 1>Grammar articles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are no articles in Swahili,</v>

120
00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:18.650
<v Speaker 1>there is no equivalent to awkward that </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the language nouns.</v>

121
00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:20.113
<v Speaker 1>Swahili has a system of now in classes </v>
<v Speaker 1>now in classes or categories of </v>

122
00:06:23.391 --> 00:06:26.870
<v Speaker 1>different types of nouns that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>represented by specific prefixes,</v>

123
00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:30.290
<v Speaker 1>in most cases,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one singular and plural for each type of</v>

124
00:06:30.291 --> 00:06:32.710
<v Speaker 1>note.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First the walk.</v>

125
00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:36.680
<v Speaker 1>Last nouns in this class represents </v>
<v Speaker 1>people or animate beings,</v>

126
00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:41.180
<v Speaker 1>words with the prefix or singular and </v>
<v Speaker 1>those with the wall prefix or plural.</v>

127
00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:44.910
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>baby babies,</v>

128
00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:49.250
<v Speaker 1>insect insects.</v>

129
00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:52.423
<v Speaker 1>Another class is the class.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nouns in this class represent trees or </v>

130
00:06:55.791 --> 00:06:56.624
<v Speaker 1>plants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Words with them or move prefix are </v>

131
00:06:58.611 --> 00:06:59.444
<v Speaker 1>singular.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While those with the prefix are plural </v>

132
00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:06.010
<v Speaker 1>tree,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two trees need another.</v>

133
00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:06.853
<v Speaker 1>Glass is the glass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This class includes a wide variety of </v>

134
00:07:09.981 --> 00:07:11.420
<v Speaker 1>nouns,</v>
<v Speaker 1>including some animals,</v>

135
00:07:11.450 --> 00:07:13.460
<v Speaker 1>loan words and miscellaneous other </v>
<v Speaker 1>words.</v>

136
00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:16.700
<v Speaker 1>This is the biggest of the mountain </v>
<v Speaker 1>glasses because of all the loan words in</v>

137
00:07:16.701 --> 00:07:18.140
<v Speaker 1>Swahili,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and for this class,</v>

138
00:07:18.141 --> 00:07:23.141
<v Speaker 1>the prefix denotes both singular and </v>
<v Speaker 1>plural bird birds,</v>

139
00:07:24.950 --> 00:07:28.430
<v Speaker 1>but this class it gets quite complicated</v>
<v Speaker 1>and sometimes the prefix changes.</v>

140
00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:33.090
<v Speaker 1>It changes to an sounds like an m before</v>
<v Speaker 1>a b or a v wine.</v>

141
00:07:33.390 --> 00:07:38.180
<v Speaker 1>And being new wines,</v>
<v Speaker 1>new and other words in this class,</v>

142
00:07:38.181 --> 00:07:39.014
<v Speaker 1>lose their prefix altogether.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's interesting to note that an </v>

143
00:07:41.211 --> 00:07:42.170
<v Speaker 1>English,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the plural form,</v>

144
00:07:42.171 --> 00:07:44.960
<v Speaker 1>is indicated by the s suffix at the end </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the word,</v>

145
00:07:44.961 --> 00:07:45.794
<v Speaker 1>but in Swahili,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's indicated by a prefix at the </v>

146
00:07:47.511 --> 00:07:48.380
<v Speaker 1>beginning of the word.</v>

147
00:07:48.590 --> 00:07:49.423
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the classes are known to be one of </v>

148
00:07:50.121 --> 00:07:52.580
<v Speaker 1>the biggest challenges facing learners </v>
<v Speaker 1>of Swahili.</v>

149
00:07:52.970 --> 00:07:53.803
<v Speaker 1>Adjectives now in class prefixes are </v>
<v Speaker 1>also applied to adjectives that modify </v>

150
00:07:57.801 --> 00:07:58.634
<v Speaker 1>those nouns.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the word for good that base form is </v>

151
00:08:00.740 --> 00:08:01.573
<v Speaker 1>Zuni,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we add a prefix means a good person </v>

152
00:08:06.230 --> 00:08:07.063
<v Speaker 1>who act was judy means good people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the prefix changes not only on the </v>

153
00:08:11.220 --> 00:08:16.220
<v Speaker 1>now but also on the adjective adverbs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Adverbs can be formed from the base form</v>

154
00:08:16.791 --> 00:08:20.620
<v Speaker 1>of the adjective by adding the prefix.</v>
<v Speaker 1>V Good Zuni.</v>

155
00:08:20.990 --> 00:08:25.900
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they got bad badly back.</v>

156
00:08:26.330 --> 00:08:28.600
<v Speaker 1>Here's an example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sentence it Soma.</v>

157
00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:34.280
<v Speaker 1>He read badly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Adverbs can also be formed from nouns by</v>

158
00:08:34.281 --> 00:08:37.460
<v Speaker 1>adding the word clock before the theory </v>
<v Speaker 1>means.</v>

159
00:08:37.461 --> 00:08:40.070
<v Speaker 1>Secret.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Quite theory mean secretly.</v>

160
00:08:40.670 --> 00:08:41.503
<v Speaker 1>Verbs aside from now in the classes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The other main thing about Swahili that </v>

161
00:08:44.931 --> 00:08:47.750
<v Speaker 1>requires some adjustment from learners </v>
<v Speaker 1>is the verbal system.</v>

162
00:08:47.870 --> 00:08:48.703
<v Speaker 1>In Swahili,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a basic verb consists of a subject </v>

163
00:08:50.721 --> 00:08:52.280
<v Speaker 1>prefix,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a tense marker,</v>

164
00:08:52.460 --> 00:08:53.780
<v Speaker 1>and object in fix.</v>

165
00:08:54.020 --> 00:08:57.210
<v Speaker 1>If the object is a separate word and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>verb stem.</v>

166
00:08:57.390 --> 00:09:00.040
<v Speaker 1>Here are some examples,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a taboo.</v>

167
00:09:00.390 --> 00:09:03.330
<v Speaker 1>This means he gave me the book is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>subject,</v>

168
00:09:03.331 --> 00:09:04.164
<v Speaker 1>pronouns,</v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning he is the tense marker </v>

169
00:09:05.971 --> 00:09:09.390
<v Speaker 1>indicating past tense Ne is the object </v>
<v Speaker 1>marker for me,</v>

170
00:09:09.690 --> 00:09:12.980
<v Speaker 1>and pop is the verb.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stem meaning give and get taboo.</v>

171
00:09:12.990 --> 00:09:14.730
<v Speaker 1>It means book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's a lone word.</v>

172
00:09:14.731 --> 00:09:15.564
<v Speaker 1>From Arabic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can change the tense of the sentence </v>

173
00:09:17.221 --> 00:09:20.000
<v Speaker 1>by changing the tense marker I can eat </v>
<v Speaker 1>that could dabble,</v>

174
00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:23.130
<v Speaker 1>so this means he will give me the book </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the future tense.</v>

175
00:09:23.340 --> 00:09:27.390
<v Speaker 1>So we changed the past tense marker to </v>
<v Speaker 1>talk the future tense marker.</v>

176
00:09:27.630 --> 00:09:30.550
<v Speaker 1>Now let's change the subject of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>sentence or could dabble.</v>

177
00:09:31.380 --> 00:09:32.213
<v Speaker 1>That means you will give me the book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we changed the subject prefix from </v>

178
00:09:36.330 --> 00:09:38.610
<v Speaker 1>which means he to uber,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which means you.</v>

179
00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:42.450
<v Speaker 1>One interesting thing is that there are </v>
<v Speaker 1>negative subject prefixes.</v>

180
00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:46.170
<v Speaker 1>That means we can make the sentence </v>
<v Speaker 1>negative by using a different subject.</v>

181
00:09:46.171 --> 00:09:48.120
<v Speaker 1>Pronouns.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's an example hat.</v>

182
00:09:48.130 --> 00:09:51.480
<v Speaker 1>Any becky tab that means he will not </v>
<v Speaker 1>give me the book,</v>

183
00:09:51.630 --> 00:09:54.270
<v Speaker 1>so remember,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the positive form was taboo.</v>

184
00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:55.193
<v Speaker 1>That meant he will give me the book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we changed the AAP to hop and that </v>

185
00:09:58.651 --> 00:10:01.320
<v Speaker 1>is the negative equivalent of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>subject prefix.</v>

186
00:10:01.500 --> 00:10:05.190
<v Speaker 1>So every subject prefix has a negative </v>
<v Speaker 1>equivalent and you have to remember both</v>

187
00:10:05.191 --> 00:10:07.680
<v Speaker 1>and you have to think about which one to</v>
<v Speaker 1>use when you're speaking.</v>

188
00:10:07.980 --> 00:10:12.830
<v Speaker 1>The basic syntax of Swahili is Svo when </v>
<v Speaker 1>there is no object in fix Tambo.</v>

189
00:10:12.880 --> 00:10:13.713
<v Speaker 1>When they're cooler,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this means elephants eat grass in the </v>

190
00:10:16.981 --> 00:10:20.250
<v Speaker 1>sentence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ten Bolt means elephant y equals they.</v>

191
00:10:20.251 --> 00:10:23.550
<v Speaker 1>That's the subject prefix,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not equals present tense marker.</v>

192
00:10:23.790 --> 00:10:24.623
<v Speaker 1>Kula equals eat and use equals grasp.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you can see that when we use a </v>

193
00:10:28.261 --> 00:10:32.250
<v Speaker 1>specific known as the subject,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we still use the subject prefix attached</v>

194
00:10:32.251 --> 00:10:33.060
<v Speaker 1>to the verb.</v>

195
00:10:33.060 --> 00:10:33.893
<v Speaker 1>Another example mean that that cooler,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this means I love eating meat is the </v>

196
00:10:37.771 --> 00:10:38.604
<v Speaker 1>subject.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Margaret meaning I not is the present </v>

197
00:10:40.231 --> 00:10:41.064
<v Speaker 1>tense marker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pen De Equals love and cooler equals </v>

198
00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:44.280
<v Speaker 1>eating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And of course,</v>

199
00:10:44.281 --> 00:10:47.760
<v Speaker 1>that's s v O is Swahili,</v>
<v Speaker 1>easy to learn.</v>

200
00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:48.713
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the pronunciation is known for being </v>

201
00:10:49.741 --> 00:10:52.530
<v Speaker 1>very straightforward and the grammar is </v>
<v Speaker 1>very logical,</v>

202
00:10:52.531 --> 00:10:55.800
<v Speaker 1>but it's also very different unless </v>
<v Speaker 1>you've studied a Bantu language before,</v>

203
00:10:55.980 --> 00:10:56.813
<v Speaker 1>but now in class system and the verbal </v>
<v Speaker 1>system with all of its affixes require </v>

204
00:10:59.591 --> 00:11:02.520
<v Speaker 1>some extra attention to learn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And for English speakers,</v>

205
00:11:02.521 --> 00:11:05.970
<v Speaker 1>the lack of immediately recognizable </v>
<v Speaker 1>vocabulary might be a challenge,</v>

206
00:11:06.030 --> 00:11:09.720
<v Speaker 1>but if you happen to speak Arabic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you will immediately recognize lots</v>

207
00:11:09.721 --> 00:11:11.070
<v Speaker 1>of Swahili.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Vocabulary.</v>

208
00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:14.970
<v Speaker 1>Here are some examples at daddy comes </v>
<v Speaker 1>from Arabic hot daughter,</v>

209
00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.570
<v Speaker 1>which means danger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chat comes from Arabic Sephardic,</v>

210
00:11:18.660 --> 00:11:21.930
<v Speaker 1>which means travel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>comes from Arabic Mahal,</v>

211
00:11:21.990 --> 00:11:25.590
<v Speaker 1>which means place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Taboo comes from the Arabic Kitab,</v>

212
00:11:25.650 --> 00:11:29.100
<v Speaker 1>which means book Buddy ed comes from the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Arabic boded,</v>

213
00:11:29.190 --> 00:11:31.770
<v Speaker 1>which means cold and that's just a small</v>
<v Speaker 1>sample.</v>

214
00:11:31.770 --> 00:11:33.990
<v Speaker 1>There are lots of Arabic words in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Swahili,</v>

215
00:11:34.140 --> 00:11:34.973
<v Speaker 1>although the pronunciation has adapted </v>
<v Speaker 1>to fit into the Swahili phonological </v>

216
00:11:37.860 --> 00:11:38.693
<v Speaker 1>system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Swahili is a unique product of the </v>

217
00:11:42.001 --> 00:11:42.834
<v Speaker 1>history of the east African coast and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the interaction of the local Bantu </v>

218
00:11:45.690 --> 00:11:48.810
<v Speaker 1>people with foreign traders from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Middle East and elsewhere.</v>

219
00:11:49.110 --> 00:11:49.943
<v Speaker 1>It is becoming more widely spoken and </v>
<v Speaker 1>continues to grow as a Lingua Franca in </v>

220
00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:53.793
<v Speaker 1>east Africa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're planning on living or </v>

221
00:11:55.091 --> 00:11:55.924
<v Speaker 1>traveling in the region or if you just </v>
<v Speaker 1>want to learn about Africa and some of </v>

222
00:11:58.361 --> 00:12:01.450
<v Speaker 1>its cultures than Swahili would be a </v>
<v Speaker 1>great language to learn.</v>

223
00:12:01.540 --> 00:12:04.390
<v Speaker 1>So the question of the day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for people who have studied Swahili,</v>

224
00:12:04.420 --> 00:12:07.930
<v Speaker 1>what did you find challenging about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and what did you find straightforward or</v>

225
00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:11.050
<v Speaker 1>simple about it and for proficient </v>
<v Speaker 1>speakers of Swahili,</v>

226
00:12:11.110 --> 00:12:13.420
<v Speaker 1>how widely spoken is Swahili in your </v>
<v Speaker 1>area?</v>

227
00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:14.433
<v Speaker 1>Is it mostly spoken as a second or third</v>
<v Speaker 1>language or are there lots of native </v>

228
00:12:17.111 --> 00:12:18.010
<v Speaker 1>speakers as well?</v>

229

<v Speaker 1>Let us know in the comments down below.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

230
00:12:20.381 --> 00:12:21.214
<v Speaker 1>for anyone who doesn't follow Lang,</v>
<v Speaker 1>focus on twitter or on facebook or on </v>

231
00:12:23.981 --> 00:12:25.690
