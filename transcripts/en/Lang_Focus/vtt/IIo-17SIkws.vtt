3
00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:10.623
<v Speaker 2>Hello everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Welcome to the Lange Focus Channel and </v>

4
00:00:12.221 --> 00:00:13.054
<v Speaker 2>my name is Paul.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A couple of months back I made a video </v>

5
00:00:15.311 --> 00:00:16.144
<v Speaker 2>about whether English is really a </v>
<v Speaker 2>dramatic language or not and I made the </v>

6
00:00:19.241 --> 00:00:20.074
<v Speaker 2>rather controversial statement that in a</v>
<v Speaker 2>sense English is a hybrid language </v>

7
00:00:23.471 --> 00:00:24.304
<v Speaker 2>because so much of its vocabulary comes </v>
<v Speaker 2>from the romance languages and from </v>

8
00:00:27.161 --> 00:00:30.010
<v Speaker 2>other languages.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That statement was controversial because</v>

9
00:00:30.011 --> 00:00:30.844
<v Speaker 2>of the core of English is indeed </v>
<v Speaker 2>Germanic and it is actually possible to </v>

10
00:00:34.331 --> 00:00:37.870
<v Speaker 2>speak English with mostly or entirely </v>
<v Speaker 2>dramatic words.</v>

11
00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:40.090
<v Speaker 2>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>instead of saying literature,</v>

12
00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:40.953
<v Speaker 2>which is a romance word,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could say book craft or instead of </v>

13
00:00:44.081 --> 00:00:46.450
<v Speaker 2>saying ancestor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could say for Ken,</v>

14
00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:50.080
<v Speaker 2>it's not exactly easy to speak that way </v>
<v Speaker 2>all the time,</v>

15
00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:50.943
<v Speaker 2>but it is possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There is actually a movement to create </v>

16
00:00:53.021 --> 00:00:53.854
<v Speaker 2>and to promote a new form of English </v>
<v Speaker 2>like this that stripped of all of its </v>

17
00:00:56.471 --> 00:00:57.304
<v Speaker 2>nondramatic influences so that English </v>
<v Speaker 2>would basically become the language of </v>

18
00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:01.383
<v Speaker 2>would have been if it had not been </v>
<v Speaker 2>influenced by romance languages and by </v>

19
00:01:04.301 --> 00:01:05.170
<v Speaker 2>Greek and others.</v>

20
00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:06.063
<v Speaker 2>Some people refer to this strictly </v>
<v Speaker 2>dramatic form of English as English </v>

21
00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:12.620
<v Speaker 2>because it's supposed to take English </v>
<v Speaker 2>back to it's Anglo Saxon roots.</v>

22
00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:15.610
<v Speaker 2>English as a form of English linguistic </v>
<v Speaker 2>purism.</v>

23
00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:16.683
<v Speaker 2>English seeks to achieve the Germanic </v>
<v Speaker 2>purity of English in a few different </v>

24
00:01:19.841 --> 00:01:20.680
<v Speaker 2>ways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>First,</v>

25
00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:21.573
<v Speaker 2>by choosing existing dramatic words </v>
<v Speaker 2>rather than the romance equivalence to </v>

26
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.790
<v Speaker 2>by reviving obsolete Germanic words.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Three,</v>

27
00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:32.680
<v Speaker 2>by adopting words from old English or </v>
<v Speaker 2>other Germanic languages for by creating</v>

28
00:01:32.681 --> 00:01:35.680
<v Speaker 2>new words based on old English or other </v>
<v Speaker 2>Germanic roots.</v>

29
00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:39.550
<v Speaker 2>So take this simple sentence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The man forgot his reign shade at home.</v>

30
00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:42.220
<v Speaker 2>What do you think?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Rain shade means something that provides</v>

31
00:01:42.221 --> 00:01:45.010
<v Speaker 2>shade from the rain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you guessed umbrella.</v>

32
00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:45.873
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Rain shade is a new word created from </v>

33
00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:50.830
<v Speaker 2>rain and shade,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's based on the word sunshade.</v>

34
00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:53.800
<v Speaker 2>Umbrella is a lone word from Italian </v>
<v Speaker 2>umbrella.</v>

35
00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:54.813
<v Speaker 2>All of the other words in this sentence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our regular English words of Germanic </v>

36
00:01:57.191 --> 00:01:57.820
<v Speaker 2>origin.</v>

37
00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:01.060
<v Speaker 2>And you probably noticed that the words </v>
<v Speaker 2>are not changed into old English.</v>

38
00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:04.270
<v Speaker 2>They're all in modern English just </v>
<v Speaker 2>without the nondramatic elements.</v>

39
00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:06.123
<v Speaker 2>Another example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I unlocked the man since he's very </v>

40
00:02:07.991 --> 00:02:10.390
<v Speaker 2>isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now here's the original sentence I wrote</v>

41
00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:11.253
<v Speaker 2>in standard English.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I respect the man because he's very </v>

42
00:02:13.421 --> 00:02:18.421
<v Speaker 2>industrious on look comes from old </v>
<v Speaker 2>English on lake to observe or regard,</v>

43
00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:22.840
<v Speaker 2>but it seems the cents has been extended</v>
<v Speaker 2>to me in regard positively or respect.</v>

44
00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:24.820
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why did I change the word because.</v>

45
00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:25.713
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because the cause part of because is of </v>

46
00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:31.020
<v Speaker 2>romance origin since it's just a </v>
<v Speaker 2>dramatic alternative to because it's.</v>

47
00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.973
<v Speaker 2>There's a real English word which is </v>
<v Speaker 2>still used in some dialects of northern </v>

48
00:02:34.511 --> 00:02:35.344
<v Speaker 2>England and I believe also in Scotland </v>
<v Speaker 2>and of course when I speak of that man </v>

49
00:02:38.381 --> 00:02:39.214
<v Speaker 2>who very and I'm referring to a name </v>
<v Speaker 2>known show player I've seen on the or a </v>

50
00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:45.700
<v Speaker 2>name known show player I've seen on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Farsi year.</v>

51
00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:47.920
<v Speaker 2>Here's the original phrase in standard </v>
<v Speaker 2>English,</v>

52
00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:49.263
<v Speaker 2>a famous actor I've seen on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>television name known as a newly a </v>

53
00:02:52.161 --> 00:02:52.994
<v Speaker 2>shaping word that comes from name and </v>
<v Speaker 2>known markedly and show player is </v>

54
00:02:56.861 --> 00:03:01.300
<v Speaker 2>another melding of two extending words </v>
<v Speaker 2>and Farsi or is a likeness of the German</v>

55
00:03:01.301 --> 00:03:06.070
<v Speaker 2>word found in everyday talk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We deal with a lot of dramatic words,</v>

56
00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:08.890
<v Speaker 2>but for some under warps,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like which ship we deal with,</v>

57
00:03:08.891 --> 00:03:11.760
<v Speaker 2>many more outland words.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In 1989,</v>

58
00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:16.120
<v Speaker 2>author Paul Anderson for later well </v>
<v Speaker 2>known ritz named unclip dish beholding,</v>

59
00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:16.983
<v Speaker 2>which means atomic theory in thoroughly </v>
<v Speaker 2>dramatic English without any outland </v>

60
00:03:20.411 --> 00:03:22.750
<v Speaker 2>words.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's take a look at some of that risk.</v>

61
00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:27.280
<v Speaker 2>For most of its being mankind did not </v>
<v Speaker 2>know what things are made of,</v>

62
00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:32.050
<v Speaker 2>but could only guess with the growth of </v>
<v Speaker 2>world can we began to learn and today we</v>

63
00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:36.040
<v Speaker 2>have a beholding of stuff and work that </v>
<v Speaker 2>watching bears out both in the workstead</v>

64
00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:39.790
<v Speaker 2>and in daily life being is used instead </v>
<v Speaker 2>of existence.</v>

65
00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:44.860
<v Speaker 2>World Ken means physics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Beholding means theory.</v>

66
00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:47.620
<v Speaker 2>Stuff I believe means matter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Work,</v>

67
00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:50.710
<v Speaker 2>I think means energy and workstead means</v>
<v Speaker 2>workplace,</v>

68
00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:53.853
<v Speaker 2>the underlying kinds of stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or the first stuff's which linked </v>

69
00:03:56.471 --> 00:03:59.110
<v Speaker 2>together in sundry ways to give rise to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the rest.</v>

70
00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:02.830
<v Speaker 2>Formerly we knew of 92 for stuffs from </v>
<v Speaker 2>water stuff,</v>

71
00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:07.890
<v Speaker 2>the lightest embarrassed to email stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The heaviest first stuffs are elements.</v>

72
00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:11.620
<v Speaker 2>Sundry means various.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a regular English word.</v>

73
00:04:11.621 --> 00:04:14.950
<v Speaker 2>It's just less common than various water</v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff means hydrogen.</v>

74
00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:20.130
<v Speaker 2>Barest means simplest and emir stuff </v>
<v Speaker 2>means uranium in my wind.</v>

75
00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:22.840
<v Speaker 2>This seems like English but somewhat </v>
<v Speaker 2>weird.</v>

76
00:04:22.841 --> 00:04:25.270
<v Speaker 2>English.</v>
<v Speaker 2>English is interesting because by trying</v>

77
00:04:25.271 --> 00:04:26.104
<v Speaker 2>to read it or use it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we get a sense of just how much we </v>

78
00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:31.570
<v Speaker 2>normally rely on nondramatic vocabulary </v>
<v Speaker 2>when we speak English.</v>

79
00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:32.493
<v Speaker 2>On the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you learn that it is possible to speak </v>

80
00:04:34.151 --> 00:04:34.984
<v Speaker 2>English without any nondramatic words.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're willing to use some archaic </v>

81
00:04:37.751 --> 00:04:40.840
<v Speaker 2>vocabulary or new vocabulary based on </v>
<v Speaker 2>Germanic roots.</v>

82
00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:41.853
<v Speaker 2>The grammar is the same,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's mainly a matter of consciously </v>

83
00:04:43.781 --> 00:04:45.610
<v Speaker 2>substituting different vocabulary.</v>

84
00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:46.593
<v Speaker 2>So the question of the day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do you think of linguistic purism </v>

85
00:04:49.091 --> 00:04:49.924
<v Speaker 2>like English.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you think there's any reason to </v>

86
00:04:51.281 --> 00:04:52.114
<v Speaker 2>remove foreign influences from a </v>
<v Speaker 2>language or do you see those foreign </v>

87
00:04:54.581 --> 00:04:57.130
<v Speaker 2>influences as just part of the languages</v>
<v Speaker 2>development?</v>
