00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:08.370
<v Speaker 1>Hello everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Welcome to the Lange focus channel.</v>

2
00:00:08.371 --> 00:00:09.820
<v Speaker 1>In.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My name is Paul.</v>

3
00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.100
<v Speaker 1>Today's topic is the languages of Italy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As you probably know,</v>

4
00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:14.993
<v Speaker 1>Italy is located in Europe on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Mediterranean Sea and shares borders </v>

5
00:00:18.421 --> 00:00:19.740
<v Speaker 1>with France,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Switzerland,</v>

6
00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.260
<v Speaker 1>Austria,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Slovenia in San Marino.</v>

7
00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.080
<v Speaker 1>Why not call this video the Italian </v>
<v Speaker 1>language?</v>

8
00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.890
<v Speaker 1>That's because Italian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as we normally think of it,</v>

9
00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.500
<v Speaker 1>is not the only language of Italy in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Italy.</v>

10
00:00:31.501 --> 00:00:35.520
<v Speaker 1>There have historically been many </v>
<v Speaker 1>different local varieties of speech that</v>

11
00:00:35.521 --> 00:00:39.630
<v Speaker 1>developed from Vulgar Latin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These dialects differ significantly from</v>

12
00:00:39.631 --> 00:00:40.464
<v Speaker 1>one locale to another,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they can be grouped together with </v>

13
00:00:42.781 --> 00:00:45.420
<v Speaker 1>other similar dialects and those groups </v>
<v Speaker 1>have dialects,</v>

14
00:00:45.421 --> 00:00:48.960
<v Speaker 1>can be considered regional languages.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of these groups have dialects,</v>

15
00:00:48.961 --> 00:00:50.940
<v Speaker 1>is Tuscan for Tulsa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Donald,</v>

16
00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:54.390
<v Speaker 1>which forms the basis of standard </v>
<v Speaker 1>Italian to be precise.</v>

17
00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.330
<v Speaker 1>The Tuscan dialect of Florence spoken in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the 15th,</v>

18
00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:00.480
<v Speaker 1>16th centuries formed the basis of </v>
<v Speaker 1>standard Italian.</v>

19
00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.720
<v Speaker 1>The modern Tuscan dialects,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which vary from place to place,</v>

20
00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:06.360
<v Speaker 1>are spoken by around three point $5,</v>
<v Speaker 1>million people,</v>

21
00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.460
<v Speaker 1>mainly in Tuscany,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Umbria,</v>

22
00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.390
<v Speaker 1>and a couple of locales on the islands </v>
<v Speaker 1>of Sardinia and Corsica.</v>

23
00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.070
<v Speaker 1>Standard Italian on the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is spoken by most of Italy,</v>

24
00:01:16.071 --> 00:01:19.680
<v Speaker 1>60 million people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's now learned universally by Italians</v>

25
00:01:19.681 --> 00:01:23.400
<v Speaker 1>because it's the language of education </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the media and in many areas,</v>

26
00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:24.263
<v Speaker 1>especially urban areas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it has largely replaced the traditional </v>

27
00:01:26.941 --> 00:01:29.220
<v Speaker 1>regional languages in most of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>country,</v>

28
00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.320
<v Speaker 1>say from around Rome to the north.</v>

29
00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:32.293
<v Speaker 1>The regional languages are used mostly </v>
<v Speaker 1>amongst the elderly and in more casual </v>

30
00:01:35.671 --> 00:01:36.504
<v Speaker 1>speech,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially outside of the larger cities </v>

31
00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:41.490
<v Speaker 1>in the south of the country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>specifically in companion,</v>

32
00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:42.413
<v Speaker 1>Calabria and Sicily as well as Sardinia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Regional languages are more widely </v>

33
00:01:46.021 --> 00:01:46.854
<v Speaker 1>spoken,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the trend is that the regional </v>

34
00:01:48.601 --> 00:01:51.240
<v Speaker 1>languages are fading for the most part.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

35
00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.300
<v Speaker 1>When it's only became a nation in 18,</v>
<v Speaker 1>61,</v>

36
00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:55.163
<v Speaker 1>the policy was to Italian people in all </v>
<v Speaker 1>the different regions of the new </v>

37
00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:00.990
<v Speaker 1>country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This was done by making Italian the sole</v>

38
00:02:00.991 --> 00:02:03.870
<v Speaker 1>language of education and of media and </v>
<v Speaker 1>of government.</v>

39
00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:05.243
<v Speaker 1>Also internal migration of people </v>
<v Speaker 1>seeking new industrial jobs brought the </v>

40
00:02:08.911 --> 00:02:11.340
<v Speaker 1>speakers of different regional languages</v>
<v Speaker 1>together,</v>

41
00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:15.630
<v Speaker 1>forcing them to speak standard Italian </v>
<v Speaker 1>in order to communicate in such regions.</v>

42
00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:16.493
<v Speaker 1>Notably in the north,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the regional languages have faded more </v>

43
00:02:18.691 --> 00:02:22.230
<v Speaker 1>quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Data from the Italian National Institute</v>

44
00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:25.830
<v Speaker 1>of Statistics shows that around half of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Italians speak mainly Italian with their</v>

45
00:02:25.831 --> 00:02:26.664
<v Speaker 1>families and friends,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this number rises to 72 point eight </v>

46
00:02:29.311 --> 00:02:30.144
<v Speaker 1>percent when speaking to strangers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about 33 percent of people speak both </v>

47
00:02:33.481 --> 00:02:36.330
<v Speaker 1>Italian and their dialect with family </v>
<v Speaker 1>and friends,</v>

48
00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:38.340
<v Speaker 1>and 19 percent with strangers.</v>

49
00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:41.490
<v Speaker 1>Sixteen percent speak only their dialect</v>
<v Speaker 1>with their families.</v>

50
00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:42.563
<v Speaker 1>13 point two percent speak only in </v>
<v Speaker 1>dialect with their friends and five </v>

51
00:02:45.931 --> 00:02:46.764
<v Speaker 1>point four percent with strangers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Notice that I wrote the word dialect </v>

52
00:02:49.711 --> 00:02:50.544
<v Speaker 1>with quotation marks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have to be careful with that word </v>

53
00:02:52.531 --> 00:02:53.364
<v Speaker 1>dialect because it might suggest that </v>
<v Speaker 1>these regional languages are varieties </v>

54
00:02:56.761 --> 00:03:01.620
<v Speaker 1>of standard Italian varieties of Tuscan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they are not varieties of Italian or</v>

55
00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:02.463
<v Speaker 1>Tuscan from which Italian derived they </v>
<v Speaker 1>developed in parallel with Tuscan their </v>

56
00:03:06.131 --> 00:03:10.210
<v Speaker 1>dialect in the sense that there are many</v>
<v Speaker 1>different local varieties of speech,</v>

57
00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:12.670
<v Speaker 1>but they are not dialects of one single </v>
<v Speaker 1>language.</v>

58
00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:13.683
<v Speaker 1>These dialects are often quite different</v>
<v Speaker 1>from each other and they are grouped </v>

59
00:03:16.271 --> 00:03:18.460
<v Speaker 1>together based on their historical </v>
<v Speaker 1>development.</v>

60
00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:19.373
<v Speaker 1>There are common features and their </v>
<v Speaker 1>mutual intelligibility and can be </v>

61
00:03:21.911 --> 00:03:22.744
<v Speaker 1>thought of as languages,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but most of these languages are not </v>

62
00:03:24.971 --> 00:03:25.804
<v Speaker 1>standardized and exactly how to group </v>
<v Speaker 1>the dialects together is not always </v>

63
00:03:28.781 --> 00:03:29.614
<v Speaker 1>clear and standard Italian spread and </v>
<v Speaker 1>began to replace the traditional </v>

64
00:03:32.861 --> 00:03:33.820
<v Speaker 1>regional languages.</v>

65
00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:34.803
<v Speaker 1>Some features of those traditional </v>
<v Speaker 1>languages made their way into standard </v>

66
00:03:37.421 --> 00:03:38.254
<v Speaker 1>Italian in each area.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This resulted in different dialects of </v>

67
00:03:40.781 --> 00:03:41.614
<v Speaker 1>standard Italian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mostly different accents and also some </v>

68
00:03:43.901 --> 00:03:46.960
<v Speaker 1>casual vocabulary adopted from those </v>
<v Speaker 1>regional languages.</v>

69
00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:48.363
<v Speaker 1>Some of Italy's language groups are </v>
<v Speaker 1>recognized as historic language </v>

70
00:03:51.101 --> 00:03:53.530
<v Speaker 1>minorities such as Albanian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>German,</v>

71
00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:56.780
<v Speaker 1>Greek,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Slovenian,</v>

72
00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:59.260
<v Speaker 1>Croatian French Frankel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>provont sal for Julian Ladene,</v>

73
00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:01.900
<v Speaker 1>oxytocin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Katelyn and Sardinian.</v>

74
00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:03.033
<v Speaker 1>Some of these are not romance languages </v>
<v Speaker 1>and some of them are national languages </v>

75
00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:08.680
<v Speaker 1>or regional languages in other nearby </v>
<v Speaker 1>countries.</v>

76
00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:09.663
<v Speaker 1>It's also worth noting that the language</v>
<v Speaker 1>is on this list that are specific to </v>

77
00:04:12.311 --> 00:04:16.180
<v Speaker 1>Italy all have standard written forms </v>
<v Speaker 1>which may be part of the reason they are</v>

78
00:04:16.181 --> 00:04:19.420
<v Speaker 1>recognized as minority languages and not</v>
<v Speaker 1>mere dialects.</v>

79
00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:23.410
<v Speaker 1>Other such languages with standard </v>
<v Speaker 1>written forms are Piedmontese,</v>

80
00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:24.303
<v Speaker 1>the European and Venetian.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The regional language with the largest </v>

81
00:04:27.041 --> 00:04:30.480
<v Speaker 1>number of speakers is neapolitan or </v>
<v Speaker 1>mobility.</v>

82
00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:34.120
<v Speaker 1>It is spoken by around five point 7 </v>
<v Speaker 1>million people,</v>

83
00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:36.110
<v Speaker 1>primarily in bustled,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lazio,</v>

84
00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:38.260
<v Speaker 1>a brute,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so and Malisa Pouliot,</v>

85
00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:42.970
<v Speaker 1>Basilicata and parts of Calabria like </v>
<v Speaker 1>standard Italian and Tuscan.</v>

86
00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:47.620
<v Speaker 1>It is part of the Italo Dalmatian branch</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the romance languages and it has some</v>

87
00:04:47.621 --> 00:04:49.990
<v Speaker 1>degree of intelligibility for speakers </v>
<v Speaker 1>of Italian,</v>

88
00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:53.320
<v Speaker 1>but it's also influenced by Spanish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>French and Arabic.</v>

89
00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:54.483
<v Speaker 1>This is not one of the recognized </v>
<v Speaker 1>minority languages and is often </v>

90
00:04:57.071 --> 00:04:58.630
<v Speaker 1>considered a dialect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In Italy,</v>

91
00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:01.540
<v Speaker 1>though it's very reasonable to consider </v>
<v Speaker 1>it a separate language.</v>

92
00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:06.400
<v Speaker 1>The second most widely spoken is </v>
<v Speaker 1>Sicilian or Siciliano.</v>

93
00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:09.280
<v Speaker 1>It is spoken by around four point 7 </v>
<v Speaker 1>million people,</v>

94
00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:11.830
<v Speaker 1>primarily in Sicily and in parts of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Calabria.</v>

95
00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:13.023
<v Speaker 1>It is also an Italo Dalmatian language </v>
<v Speaker 1>like Neapolitan Sicilian has been </v>

96
00:05:16.511 --> 00:05:18.790
<v Speaker 1>influenced by foreign languages.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Greek,</v>

97
00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:20.020
<v Speaker 1>Arabic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Spanish,</v>

98
00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:20.883
<v Speaker 1>Katelyn and French.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sicilian is sometimes said to be the </v>

99
00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:24.903
<v Speaker 1>oldest romance language,</v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning it was the earliest language to </v>

100
00:05:27.431 --> 00:05:30.730
<v Speaker 1>split off from vulgar Latin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not everyone accepts this idea.</v>

101
00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:34.270
<v Speaker 1>This is not one of the recognized </v>
<v Speaker 1>minority languages,</v>

102
00:05:34.271 --> 00:05:39.271
<v Speaker 1>either another is Venetian or Veneto,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is spoken by around three point $9</v>

103
00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:44.660
<v Speaker 1>million people in the Veneto region as </v>
<v Speaker 1>well as a neighboring Trentino Alto,</v>

104
00:05:44.661 --> 00:05:47.020
<v Speaker 1>our Dj and Friuli Veneto Julia.</v>

105
00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:48.133
<v Speaker 1>The nation was a language of prestige </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the time of the Venetian republic </v>

106
00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:55.120
<v Speaker 1>and Venetian was an important part of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Mediterranean Lingua Franca,</v>

107
00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:56.013
<v Speaker 1>also known as severe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a regional pigeon language spoken </v>

108
00:05:58.641 --> 00:05:59.474
<v Speaker 1>between the 11th and 19th centuries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is also not one of the recognized </v>

109
00:06:03.021 --> 00:06:07.110
<v Speaker 1>minority languages.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Next is Lombard or Lombardo,</v>

110
00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:09.710
<v Speaker 1>which is spoken by three point 6 million</v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

111
00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:13.010
<v Speaker 1>mainly in the lumbar region and parts of</v>
<v Speaker 1>neighboring regions.</v>

112
00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:15.650
<v Speaker 1>It is part of the Gallo Italia Romance </v>
<v Speaker 1>Branch,</v>

113
00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:20.740
<v Speaker 1>along with the Durian and Piedmontese </v>
<v Speaker 1>Piedmontese or pmo and pays is spoken by</v>

114
00:06:21.801 --> 00:06:22.634
<v Speaker 1>around one point 6 million people mainly</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the Piedmont region of northwestern </v>

115
00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:26.803
<v Speaker 1>Italy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The gear in or Laguna is spoken by </v>

116
00:06:29.121 --> 00:06:32.090
<v Speaker 1>around 500,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>people in the [inaudible] region.</v>

117
00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:35.800
<v Speaker 1>Another Gallo metallic language is </v>
<v Speaker 1>Emilia-romagna.</v>

118
00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:39.710
<v Speaker 1>All this language consists of two </v>
<v Speaker 1>closely related dialect groups,</v>

119
00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:43.820
<v Speaker 1>a million and Roman Yoel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is spoken by around one point seven,</v>

120
00:06:43.821 --> 00:06:47.270
<v Speaker 1>3 million people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mainly in the region of Emilia Romania.</v>

121
00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:50.180
<v Speaker 1>This is not a recognized minority </v>
<v Speaker 1>language.</v>

122
00:06:51.530 --> 00:06:56.420
<v Speaker 1>Next is Sardinian or suicide to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is spoken by around 1 million people,</v>

123
00:06:56.540 --> 00:06:57.373
<v Speaker 1>mainly on the island of Sardinia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sardinian is not part of the Italo </v>

124
00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:01.453
<v Speaker 1>Dalmatian branch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but forms of separate Sardinian branch </v>

125
00:07:03.111 --> 00:07:03.944
<v Speaker 1>of romance languages,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's less intelligible for speakers </v>

126
00:07:06.231 --> 00:07:08.540
<v Speaker 1>of Italian.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then Neapolitan or Sicilian.</v>

127
00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:11.270
<v Speaker 1>Sardinian is a recognized minority </v>
<v Speaker 1>language.</v>

128
00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:12.883
<v Speaker 1>Next is Freudian or foot lung,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is spoken in the northeastern </v>

129
00:07:16.521 --> 00:07:20.210
<v Speaker 1>region of Friuli by around 600,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>native speakers.</v>

130
00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:24.290
<v Speaker 1>It is a retail romance language that is </v>
<v Speaker 1>related to another language in northeast</v>

131
00:07:24.291 --> 00:07:26.240
<v Speaker 1>Italy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ladene as well as the role.</v>

132
00:07:26.241 --> 00:07:27.074
<v Speaker 1>Much language spoken in Switzerland for </v>
<v Speaker 1>Julian is a recognized minority </v>

133
00:07:30.231 --> 00:07:31.064
<v Speaker 1>language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ladene is also a recognized minority </v>

134
00:07:33.531 --> 00:07:36.320
<v Speaker 1>language and a spoken by around 50,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

135
00:07:37.310 --> 00:07:41.210
<v Speaker 1>There are also the central Italian </v>
<v Speaker 1>dialects or the [inaudible].</v>

136
00:07:41.450 --> 00:07:43.450
<v Speaker 1>They are spoken in Lazio,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Umbria,</v>

137
00:07:43.670 --> 00:07:46.100
<v Speaker 1>central Medicaid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the southern part of Tuscany,</v>

138
00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:47.350
<v Speaker 1>and part of a brutal.</v>

139
00:07:47.630 --> 00:07:50.780
<v Speaker 1>These dialects are closely related with </v>
<v Speaker 1>each other and with Tuscan,</v>

140
00:07:51.050 --> 00:07:53.390
<v Speaker 1>and they're all part of the Tallow </v>
<v Speaker 1>Dalmatian branch.</v>

141
00:07:53.750 --> 00:07:57.140
<v Speaker 1>These are thought of as Italian dialects</v>
<v Speaker 1>rather than separate languages,</v>

142
00:07:57.260 --> 00:07:59.120
<v Speaker 1>even though they didn't develop from </v>
<v Speaker 1>Tuscan,</v>

143
00:07:59.270 --> 00:08:01.460
<v Speaker 1>but developed as sister dialects to </v>
<v Speaker 1>Tuscan.</v>

144
00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:04.220
<v Speaker 1>There are around 3 million speakers of </v>
<v Speaker 1>these dialects.</v>

145
00:08:04.580 --> 00:08:05.413
<v Speaker 1>Keep in mind that the number of speakers</v>
<v Speaker 1>for these regional languages might be </v>

146
00:08:07.911 --> 00:08:08.744
<v Speaker 1>misleading because virtually everybody </v>
<v Speaker 1>has also fluent in standard Italian and </v>

147
00:08:12.621 --> 00:08:16.190
<v Speaker 1>their use of the regional languages </v>
<v Speaker 1>might be limited to certain situations.</v>

148
00:08:16.370 --> 00:08:17.203
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in communicating with their elderly </v>

149
00:08:18.651 --> 00:08:19.484
<v Speaker 1>relatives in smaller numbers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are also the languages spoken in </v>

150
00:08:22.251 --> 00:08:25.280
<v Speaker 1>neighboring countries either as regional</v>
<v Speaker 1>or national languages.</v>

151
00:08:25.310 --> 00:08:26.143
<v Speaker 1>German through are about 293,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>speakers in northern areas of Italy </v>

152
00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:32.330
<v Speaker 1>adjacent to Germany,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Austria and Switzerland.</v>

153
00:08:32.570 --> 00:08:36.920
<v Speaker 1>Franco provolone solve has around 90,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>speakers in the north near France,</v>

154
00:08:36.980 --> 00:08:40.310
<v Speaker 1>mostly in Piedmont.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Albanian has around 80,000</v>

155
00:08:40.311 --> 00:08:41.144
<v Speaker 1>speakers.</v>

156
00:08:41.210 --> 00:08:45.320
<v Speaker 1>Slovene has around 70,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>speakers near the border with Slovenia.</v>

157
00:08:45.710 --> 00:08:49.550
<v Speaker 1>Oxytocin has around 40,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>speakers in Piedmont and the Judea.</v>

158
00:08:49.910 --> 00:08:50.743
<v Speaker 1>Katelyn is spoken by around 20,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>people in the city of alligator on </v>

159
00:08:54.411 --> 00:08:57.000
<v Speaker 1>Sardinia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which began as a Katelyn settlement.</v>

160
00:08:57.480 --> 00:08:58.313
<v Speaker 1>Keeping in mind that the regional </v>
<v Speaker 1>romance languages are generally </v>

161
00:09:00.421 --> 00:09:03.870
<v Speaker 1>considered dialects in Italy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought it would be fun to have a look</v>

162
00:09:03.871 --> 00:09:06.210
<v Speaker 1>at some of them at see how similar or </v>
<v Speaker 1>different they are.</v>

163
00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:11.360
<v Speaker 1>Let's look at standard Italian </v>
<v Speaker 1>Neapolitan Sardinian and for Uli in it,</v>

164
00:09:11.870 --> 00:09:12.703
<v Speaker 1>allegedly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this means I would like something to </v>

165
00:09:14.491 --> 00:09:18.060
<v Speaker 1>read word for word.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's would like first person singular,</v>

166
00:09:18.180 --> 00:09:22.720
<v Speaker 1>something to read and to Neapolitan </v>
<v Speaker 1>whooley causality.</v>

167
00:09:22.860 --> 00:09:23.693
<v Speaker 1>Judah here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the words all correspond and if you're </v>

168
00:09:25.681 --> 00:09:26.514
<v Speaker 1>looking for it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can see the connection between the </v>

169
00:09:27.901 --> 00:09:28.734
<v Speaker 1>words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the words are also different enough </v>

170
00:09:30.181 --> 00:09:31.014
<v Speaker 1>to make comprehensive difficult </v>
<v Speaker 1>neapolitan words are often shorter than </v>

171
00:09:33.811 --> 00:09:37.860
<v Speaker 1>the Italian equivalence with final </v>
<v Speaker 1>vowels or final syllables reduced.</v>

172
00:09:38.220 --> 00:09:39.720
<v Speaker 1>In Italian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's vote a.</v>

173
00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:44.670
<v Speaker 1>This becomes valueless in Neapolitan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've also seen this spelled with an e at</v>

174
00:09:44.671 --> 00:09:47.550
<v Speaker 1>the end.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Neapolitan spelling is not standardized.</v>

175
00:09:47.700 --> 00:09:51.390
<v Speaker 1>Italian quality causa is Qaqc course in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Neapolitan.</v>

176
00:09:51.570 --> 00:09:54.930
<v Speaker 1>The Italian preposition dot meaning from</v>
<v Speaker 1>or buy,</v>

177
00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:59.010
<v Speaker 1>but also used to be for an infinitive </v>
<v Speaker 1>like this becomes our in the Apollo.</v>

178
00:09:59.011 --> 00:09:59.844
<v Speaker 1>Isn't the word for reed is similar </v>
<v Speaker 1>except the final vowel sound after our </v>

179
00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:07.230
<v Speaker 1>is more like the Schwab in the Apollo </v>
<v Speaker 1>written more like an ah sound.</v>

180
00:10:07.470 --> 00:10:08.303
<v Speaker 1>Unstressed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Vowels often sounds like Schwab in the </v>

181
00:10:10.021 --> 00:10:14.430
<v Speaker 1>Apollo isn't and these reduced vowels </v>
<v Speaker 1>are sometimes not written in Sardinian.</v>

182
00:10:14.830 --> 00:10:15.663
<v Speaker 1>You have all the lead,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unlike an Italian Neapolitan in which </v>

183
00:10:19.771 --> 00:10:22.380
<v Speaker 1>the Personal Pronoun Ego was dropped </v>
<v Speaker 1>here,</v>

184
00:10:22.381 --> 00:10:24.810
<v Speaker 1>it's included and didn't Sardinian it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>Ia,</v>

185
00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:26.850
<v Speaker 1>but I believe this can also be dropped </v>
<v Speaker 1>in.</v>

186
00:10:26.860 --> 00:10:27.693
<v Speaker 1>Sardinian boldly is the conditional form</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the verb which comes from the same </v>

187
00:10:31.411 --> 00:10:32.244
<v Speaker 1>root as the Italian Neapolitan once,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it takes on a different form and </v>

188
00:10:35.131 --> 00:10:36.780
<v Speaker 1>Sardinian here.</v>

189
00:10:36.860 --> 00:10:39.270
<v Speaker 1>Quality Coza is represented by two </v>
<v Speaker 1>words,</v>

190
00:10:40.650 --> 00:10:41.483
<v Speaker 1>I believe means some on its own.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here at the preposition is slightly </v>

191
00:10:44.881 --> 00:10:47.460
<v Speaker 1>different and then we have the verb </v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning to read,</v>

192
00:10:47.490 --> 00:10:49.380
<v Speaker 1>which is obviously related to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>others,</v>

193
00:10:49.500 --> 00:10:54.500
<v Speaker 1>but the infinitive is formed differently</v>
<v Speaker 1>and in Freeland evil that is here we see</v>

194
00:10:55.921 --> 00:10:58.290
<v Speaker 1>the personal pronoun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He in Freeland,</v>

195
00:10:58.350 --> 00:10:59.183
<v Speaker 1>this can't be dropped.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The verb here clearly comes from the </v>

196
00:11:01.651 --> 00:11:02.484
<v Speaker 1>same root as the others,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this one takes on quite a different </v>

197
00:11:04.771 --> 00:11:05.604
<v Speaker 1>form and as a learner of Italian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I might mistake this for the Italian </v>

198
00:11:08.641 --> 00:11:10.920
<v Speaker 1>word velocity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which means to fly.</v>

199
00:11:11.130 --> 00:11:11.963
<v Speaker 1>The word for something is out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't actually know the root of this </v>

200
00:11:14.611 --> 00:11:15.444
<v Speaker 1>word,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the way I'll remember it is that it </v>

201
00:11:16.771 --> 00:11:19.470
<v Speaker 1>sounds like the middle of quality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cool.</v>

202
00:11:19.500 --> 00:11:20.333
<v Speaker 1>Now I'll never forget this word here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Notice the slightly different </v>

203
00:11:22.861 --> 00:11:25.530
<v Speaker 1>preposition and notice the infinitive of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the verb,</v>

204
00:11:25.531 --> 00:11:26.460
<v Speaker 1>meaning to read.</v>

205
00:11:26.550 --> 00:11:28.740
<v Speaker 1>This looks quite different from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Italian word,</v>

206
00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:33.290
<v Speaker 1>but it looks rather similar to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>French word Leah or Spanish layer.</v>

207
00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:34.313
<v Speaker 1>So far.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can probably notice a lot of </v>

208
00:11:35.641 --> 00:11:37.500
<v Speaker 1>similarity when you look at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>sentences,</v>

209
00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:38.513
<v Speaker 1>but there's also enough difference to </v>
<v Speaker 1>make these mutually unintelligible to a </v>

210
00:11:41.281 --> 00:11:42.114
<v Speaker 1>large extent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When they're spoken Miano date that is </v>

211
00:11:46.261 --> 00:11:49.320
<v Speaker 1>solely owned Digi.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This sentence means they told me that we</v>

212
00:11:49.321 --> 00:11:51.930
<v Speaker 1>will arrive around 11:00</v>
<v Speaker 1>word for word.</v>

213
00:11:51.931 --> 00:11:52.764
<v Speaker 1>It's to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have said that we will arrive </v>

214
00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:56.673
<v Speaker 1>around the 11 in the Apollo written </v>
<v Speaker 1>modernity took here we see that the </v>

215
00:12:02.830 --> 00:12:07.830
<v Speaker 1>object pronoun contracts with the verb </v>
<v Speaker 1>and notice again that a neapolitan,</v>

216
00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:10.980
<v Speaker 1>the final vowel becomes reduced to a </v>
<v Speaker 1>Schwa sound.</v>

217
00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:15.310
<v Speaker 1>The main verb here that he is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>equivalent of Ditto in Italian,</v>

218
00:12:15.370 --> 00:12:16.203
<v Speaker 1>d sounds in Italian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>often correspond to our sounds in </v>

219
00:12:18.491 --> 00:12:19.324
<v Speaker 1>Neapolitan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Word K is pronounced cook when </v>

220
00:12:21.670 --> 00:12:22.503
<v Speaker 1>unstressed and contracts with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>following verb because of its initial </v>

221
00:12:25.421 --> 00:12:26.254
<v Speaker 1>vowel sound,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Italian word or got a mall is a vm </v>

222
00:12:29.590 --> 00:12:33.580
<v Speaker 1>in Neapolitan pay is the equivalent of </v>
<v Speaker 1>pad in Italian,</v>

223
00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:37.260
<v Speaker 1>meaning for the wounded she becomes </v>
<v Speaker 1>liquid in the show.</v>

224
00:12:37.540 --> 00:12:38.373
<v Speaker 1>Once again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>notice all those reduced sounds in </v>

225
00:12:40.451 --> 00:12:45.451
<v Speaker 1>Sardinian monthly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now do by region.</v>

226
00:12:46.450 --> 00:12:47.283
<v Speaker 1>Here we can see that similar to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>other languages in Sardinia in the past </v>

227
00:12:50.321 --> 00:12:52.720
<v Speaker 1>can be expressed by using the auxiliary </v>
<v Speaker 1>verb,</v>

228
00:12:52.750 --> 00:12:55.570
<v Speaker 1>meaning to have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though it looks quite different,</v>

229
00:12:55.900 --> 00:12:58.450
<v Speaker 1>the unsound is a hint.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The main verb,</v>

230
00:12:58.451 --> 00:12:59.530
<v Speaker 1>however,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is different.</v>

231
00:12:59.860 --> 00:13:03.580
<v Speaker 1>I'll speculate that this for now is </v>
<v Speaker 1>related to the Latin verb.</v>

232
00:13:03.620 --> 00:13:07.210
<v Speaker 1>Not meaning to tell or narrate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>though I'm not sure.</v>

233
00:13:07.390 --> 00:13:11.040
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In Italian is cut the future tenses from</v>

234
00:13:11.050 --> 00:13:13.270
<v Speaker 1>differently and Sardinian with an </v>
<v Speaker 1>auxiliary verb.</v>

235
00:13:13.990 --> 00:13:15.440
<v Speaker 1>Here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>instead of [inaudible],</v>

236
00:13:15.580 --> 00:13:19.210
<v Speaker 1>we see a candidate which is similar to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Italian preposition,</v>

237
00:13:19.300 --> 00:13:20.133
<v Speaker 1>a controller,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which means beside here we have a </v>

238
00:13:22.331 --> 00:13:23.164
<v Speaker 1>different definite article and wounded.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She becomes wound Digi inferiorly and </v>

239
00:13:30.770 --> 00:13:34.690
<v Speaker 1>inferiorly and it seems that rather than</v>
<v Speaker 1>use a specific indirect object,</v>

240
00:13:34.691 --> 00:13:35.524
<v Speaker 1>pronouns to preposition is used with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>object pronouns like to me here on dee </v>

241
00:13:40.921 --> 00:13:41.754
<v Speaker 1>dee is the past tense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>formed the same way as an Italian </v>

242
00:13:44.220 --> 00:13:46.090
<v Speaker 1>Neapolitan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but with different forms.</v>

243
00:13:46.420 --> 00:13:47.253
<v Speaker 1>Here we have the subject pronouns which </v>
<v Speaker 1>is not necessary and the other </v>

244
00:13:49.481 --> 00:13:52.300
<v Speaker 1>languages,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and here we have the verb for arrive,</v>

245
00:13:52.390 --> 00:13:53.223
<v Speaker 1>but you might not have immediately </v>
<v Speaker 1>recognized it because it begins with a </v>

246
00:13:55.811 --> 00:13:56.644
<v Speaker 1>single are rather than an a and a double</v>
<v Speaker 1>are told is the preposition meaning </v>

247
00:14:01.060 --> 00:14:06.060
<v Speaker 1>around and dish is own.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She will do it for a trestle.</v>

248
00:14:07.330 --> 00:14:10.240
<v Speaker 1>This sentence means I have two brothers </v>
<v Speaker 1>and three sisters,</v>

249
00:14:10.450 --> 00:14:12.460
<v Speaker 1>word for word.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's have first person,</v>

250
00:14:12.461 --> 00:14:13.294
<v Speaker 1>singular present tense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two brothers and three sisters in </v>

251
00:14:16.721 --> 00:14:18.400
<v Speaker 1>Neapolitan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Doing good grief.</v>

252
00:14:18.540 --> 00:14:19.373
<v Speaker 1>Raga in the Italian sentence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>notice that the verb for how is a form </v>

253
00:14:24.131 --> 00:14:27.040
<v Speaker 1>of the verb of ETA,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in the Neapolitan sentence,</v>

254
00:14:27.070 --> 00:14:27.903
<v Speaker 1>it's taking the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is similar to the word used in </v>

255
00:14:29.651 --> 00:14:32.200
<v Speaker 1>Spanish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In Italian there's a word like this,</v>

256
00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:33.233
<v Speaker 1>tenacity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which would be 10 goal in the first </v>

257
00:14:34.811 --> 00:14:38.020
<v Speaker 1>person singular,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that means to hold in your hand,</v>

258
00:14:38.170 --> 00:14:42.250
<v Speaker 1>not to have in the general sense here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The word for to is slightly different.</v>

259
00:14:42.450 --> 00:14:43.283
<v Speaker 1>Here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The word for brothers is flat rather </v>

260
00:14:45.131 --> 00:14:45.964
<v Speaker 1>than fill out daily,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the word for sisters is also </v>

261
00:14:47.771 --> 00:14:48.604
<v Speaker 1>shortened Soda Rather Than Soda.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And notice that the production of the </v>

262
00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:54.890
<v Speaker 1>endings make the gender of nouns </v>
<v Speaker 1>somewhat unclear.</v>

263
00:14:55.010 --> 00:14:56.030
<v Speaker 1>In this case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>

264
00:14:56.031 --> 00:14:58.590
<v Speaker 1>we know because of their meaning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but with other nouns,</v>

265
00:14:58.591 --> 00:15:01.310
<v Speaker 1>the gender might be less clear in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Sardinian.</v>

266
00:15:04.610 --> 00:15:07.370
<v Speaker 1>Here's the verb tense is similar to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Neapolitan.</v>

267
00:15:07.371 --> 00:15:12.371
<v Speaker 1>One Tango to is deuce rather than do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and three is today's rather than three.</v>

268
00:15:13.550 --> 00:15:17.390
<v Speaker 1>Both the verb and the numbers remind me </v>
<v Speaker 1>of Spanish here next.</v>

269
00:15:17.510 --> 00:15:21.110
<v Speaker 1>Friday's and Saudis mean brother and </v>
<v Speaker 1>sister respectively,</v>

270
00:15:21.350 --> 00:15:24.140
<v Speaker 1>and notice that they formed the plural </v>
<v Speaker 1>by adding an s.</v>

271
00:15:24.170 --> 00:15:26.450
<v Speaker 1>This is how it's done in many romance </v>
<v Speaker 1>languages,</v>

272
00:15:26.570 --> 00:15:30.920
<v Speaker 1>but not in standard Italian in which the</v>
<v Speaker 1>final vowel of the word indicates number</v>

273
00:15:31.930 --> 00:15:35.930
<v Speaker 1>in for Julian.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>

274
00:15:35.931 --> 00:15:38.490
<v Speaker 1>we see that the Pronoun can't be dropped</v>
<v Speaker 1>in for your lead.</v>

275
00:15:38.720 --> 00:15:42.230
<v Speaker 1>Here we see the verb to have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a cognate with the verb and the</v>

276
00:15:42.231 --> 00:15:43.064
<v Speaker 1>Italian sentence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unlike the ones in the Neapolitan and </v>

277
00:15:45.141 --> 00:15:47.550
<v Speaker 1>Sardinian sentences,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's pronounced it,</v>

278
00:15:47.750 --> 00:15:51.770
<v Speaker 1>but you can see a connection with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>French word a to his dose,</v>

279
00:15:51.830 --> 00:15:52.663
<v Speaker 1>like in Spanish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The word for brother is basically the </v>

280
00:15:54.621 --> 00:15:58.370
<v Speaker 1>same as the Sardinian word,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the plural is formed by adding s.</v>

281
00:15:58.760 --> 00:16:01.850
<v Speaker 1>The word for sister Sol is like the </v>
<v Speaker 1>French word,</v>

282
00:16:01.910 --> 00:16:06.860
<v Speaker 1>so as you can see from these examples,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of linguistic diversity in</v>

283
00:16:06.861 --> 00:16:10.820
<v Speaker 1>Italy with regional languages and their </v>
<v Speaker 1>local dialects having their own colorful</v>

284
00:16:10.821 --> 00:16:14.270
<v Speaker 1>features that reflect the history and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the traditions of their speakers.</v>

285
00:16:14.390 --> 00:16:15.223
<v Speaker 1>Many of these languages and dialects are</v>
<v Speaker 1>endangered and risk being completely </v>

286
00:16:18.291 --> 00:16:21.170
<v Speaker 1>replaced by standard Italian.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In the coming generations.</v>

287
00:16:21.470 --> 00:16:23.780
<v Speaker 1>There are some efforts to preserve these</v>
<v Speaker 1>languages,</v>

288
00:16:23.810 --> 00:16:24.643
<v Speaker 1>but will they succeed?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that brings me to the question of </v>

289
00:16:26.781 --> 00:16:30.320
<v Speaker 1>the day for people who speak both </v>
<v Speaker 1>Italian and another language of Italy,</v>

290
00:16:30.410 --> 00:16:31.243
<v Speaker 1>how often do you use your traditional </v>
<v Speaker 1>local language and in what situations </v>

291
00:16:34.760 --> 00:16:38.420
<v Speaker 1>and for learners of Italian has the </v>
<v Speaker 1>influence of these traditional languages</v>

292
00:16:38.421 --> 00:16:41.660
<v Speaker 1>and dialects ever affected your </v>
<v Speaker 1>communication with native speakers?</v>

293
00:16:41.780 --> 00:16:44.540
<v Speaker 1>Let us know in the comments down below.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Be sure to follow lane,</v>
