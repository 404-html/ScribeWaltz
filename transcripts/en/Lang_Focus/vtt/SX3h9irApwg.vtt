<v Speaker 1>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why does everyone say congee are so </v>

3
00:00:06.331 --> 00:00:08.130
<v Speaker 1>difficult?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This one looks pretty easy.</v>

4
00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:11.040
<v Speaker 1>So does this one and this one?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not bad.</v>

5
00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.010
<v Speaker 1>And how about the next one?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my gosh.</v>

6
00:00:14.011 --> 00:00:19.011
<v Speaker 1>What the heck is that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hello everyone.</v>

7
00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:23.820
<v Speaker 1>Welcome to the Lange Focus Channel and </v>
<v Speaker 1>my name is Paul.</v>

8
00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.090
<v Speaker 1>Today we're going to talk about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Japanese writing system.</v>

9
00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:29.280
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not the entire writing system.</v>

10
00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:32.010
<v Speaker 1>Japanese is written with three different</v>
<v Speaker 1>scripts.</v>

11
00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.380
<v Speaker 1>He's gonna cut that out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Congee,</v>

12
00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.600
<v Speaker 1>which is the one that we want to focus </v>
<v Speaker 1>on today.</v>

13
00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:39.420
<v Speaker 1>He had gone to and cut to conduct,</v>
<v Speaker 1>were developed in Japan,</v>

14
00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:40.283
<v Speaker 1>but congee are actually Chinese </v>
<v Speaker 1>characters that were adapted to fit the </v>

15
00:00:43.351 --> 00:00:46.720
<v Speaker 1>Japanese language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Come Gr logograms a logo.</v>

16
00:00:46.721 --> 00:00:50.700
<v Speaker 1>Graham is a character that represents a </v>
<v Speaker 1>word or a meaningful part of a word.</v>

17
00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.790
<v Speaker 1>Congee are not characters that you read </v>
<v Speaker 1>phonetically,</v>

18
00:00:53.791 --> 00:00:57.900
<v Speaker 1>but rather each congee represents a </v>
<v Speaker 1>distinct idea rather than a sound.</v>

19
00:00:58.410 --> 00:00:59.243
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this congee on its own represents the </v>

20
00:01:00.991 --> 00:01:03.600
<v Speaker 1>concept of a mountain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but just from looking at it,</v>

21
00:01:03.601 --> 00:01:06.150
<v Speaker 1>there's no way to know that it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>pronounced as Yama.</v>

22
00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:07.313
<v Speaker 1>You have to remember how the characters </v>
<v Speaker 1>pronounced and when you see the </v>

23
00:01:09.391 --> 00:01:11.340
<v Speaker 1>character,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you associate it with the sound,</v>

24
00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:14.460
<v Speaker 1>but some congee do also contain a </v>
<v Speaker 1>phonetic element,</v>

25
00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:15.323
<v Speaker 1>which is something we'll look at later.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Japan initially came into contact with </v>

26
00:01:18.391 --> 00:01:22.620
<v Speaker 1>Chinese characters during diplomatic </v>
<v Speaker 1>missions between the Han Dynasty and the</v>

27
00:01:22.621 --> 00:01:23.454
<v Speaker 1>Yamato State of Japan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which eventually led to the Japanese </v>

28
00:01:25.801 --> 00:01:26.634
<v Speaker 1>adoption and adaptation of Congee.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I talk more about this in my video on </v>

29
00:01:30.391 --> 00:01:31.224
<v Speaker 1>the Japanese language,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which you can find right here if we </v>

30
00:01:33.961 --> 00:01:36.900
<v Speaker 1>include every country that has ever been</v>
<v Speaker 1>used in Japanese.</v>

31
00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.560
<v Speaker 1>There are tens of thousands of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but of course that includes many obscure</v>

32
00:01:40.561 --> 00:01:43.230
<v Speaker 1>or archaic congee.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There really aren't worth learning.</v>

33
00:01:43.231 --> 00:01:44.064
<v Speaker 1>For the average person in 1946,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Japanese government aimed to </v>

34
00:01:47.431 --> 00:01:48.264
<v Speaker 1>simplify orthography by limiting the </v>
<v Speaker 1>number of congee to a smaller list of </v>

35
00:01:51.601 --> 00:01:52.434
<v Speaker 1>1,850</v>
<v Speaker 1>country known as the Toyo Congee or </v>

36
00:01:55.711 --> 00:01:56.790
<v Speaker 1>common use congee.</v>

37
00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.700
<v Speaker 1>That list has since been updated to </v>
<v Speaker 1>include 2000,</v>

38
00:01:59.701 --> 00:02:00.534
<v Speaker 1>136 basic congee,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which are referred to as the congee or </v>

39
00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:05.483
<v Speaker 1>regular use congee.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This list determines what congee </v>

40
00:02:07.621 --> 00:02:08.454
<v Speaker 1>students are expected to learn at school</v>
<v Speaker 1>and what congee or used in official </v>

41
00:02:11.251 --> 00:02:13.740
<v Speaker 1>government documents.</v>
<v Speaker 1>With this part of the reform,</v>

42
00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:14.603
<v Speaker 1>the Japanese government also simplified </v>
<v Speaker 1>some of the more complex congee so that </v>

43
00:02:17.851 --> 00:02:21.120
<v Speaker 1>they could be read more easily.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These congee are called Shinji tie,</v>

44
00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:23.700
<v Speaker 1>which literally means new character </v>
<v Speaker 1>forms.</v>

45
00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.120
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this congee meaning iron,</v>

46
00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:28.230
<v Speaker 1>the component on the right with </v>
<v Speaker 1>simplified,</v>

47
00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:32.610
<v Speaker 1>and this congee meaning wide.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's inner component was simplified like</v>

48
00:02:32.611 --> 00:02:33.444
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You might be aware that such a </v>

49
00:02:35.221 --> 00:02:36.054
<v Speaker 1>simplification also occurred in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>adoption of simplified Chinese writing </v>

50
00:02:39.181 --> 00:02:42.570
<v Speaker 1>and trying to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we're much more limited in scope and</v>

51
00:02:42.571 --> 00:02:43.404
<v Speaker 1>these changes only affected a limited </v>
<v Speaker 1>number of characters in Japanese types </v>

52
00:02:47.221 --> 00:02:48.054
<v Speaker 1>of congee.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Congee can be divided into several </v>

53
00:02:49.861 --> 00:02:54.000
<v Speaker 1>categories of mudgee or characters based</v>
<v Speaker 1>on how each character is formed.</v>

54
00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:56.340
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are showcased Emoji.</v>

55
00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:57.383
<v Speaker 1>This refers to pictograph congee such as</v>
<v Speaker 1>this one for a mountain or this one for </v>

56
00:03:00.881 --> 00:03:01.714
<v Speaker 1>tree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These ones look something like the </v>

57
00:03:02.891 --> 00:03:03.724
<v Speaker 1>objects that they represent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she g Magii and Kai Emoji are iddio </v>

58
00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:08.443
<v Speaker 1>graphs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>characters that represent ideas rather </v>

59
00:03:10.511 --> 00:03:13.840
<v Speaker 1>than visually representing an object.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

60
00:03:13.841 --> 00:03:17.050
<v Speaker 1>this congee meaning up and this one </v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning rest.</v>

61
00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.890
<v Speaker 1>The difference between these two types </v>
<v Speaker 1>of video graphs is that she gmo,</v>

62
00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:22.053
<v Speaker 1>are rather simple.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas Emoji are compound idiographic </v>

63
00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:25.983
<v Speaker 1>that use multiple components that </v>
<v Speaker 1>combined together to create an overall </v>

64
00:03:29.141 --> 00:03:32.950
<v Speaker 1>meaning with each of the components also</v>
<v Speaker 1>existing as independent congee.</v>

65
00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:34.353
<v Speaker 1>The component on the left means person </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the components on the right means </v>

66
00:03:37.811 --> 00:03:38.644
<v Speaker 1>tree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A person leaning against the tree is </v>

67
00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:43.470
<v Speaker 1>resting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a good example of Emoji.</v>

68
00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:47.350
<v Speaker 1>Another example is this congee.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's see if we can figure out what this</v>

69
00:03:47.351 --> 00:03:49.330
<v Speaker 1>one means by looking at the components.</v>

70
00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:51.790
<v Speaker 1>I see this character which I know means </v>
<v Speaker 1>mountain,</v>

71
00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:55.240
<v Speaker 1>and I see this one which means up and </v>
<v Speaker 1>this one which means down,</v>

72
00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:59.170
<v Speaker 1>so I'm going to guess that this country </v>
<v Speaker 1>has something to do with traveling up or</v>

73
00:03:59.171 --> 00:04:02.110
<v Speaker 1>down a mountain like maybe it's hiking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

74
00:04:02.111 --> 00:04:02.944
<v Speaker 1>if we look at the actual meaning of this</v>
<v Speaker 1>country will see that it means a path </v>

75
00:04:05.681 --> 00:04:07.810
<v Speaker 1>through the mountains or a mountain </v>
<v Speaker 1>pass,</v>

76
00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:11.770
<v Speaker 1>so I'd say that's pretty close.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This type of Congee that kind of tells a</v>

77
00:04:11.771 --> 00:04:15.220
<v Speaker 1>story is a of Emoji,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but only a small number of congee,</v>

78
00:04:15.221 --> 00:04:17.290
<v Speaker 1>telecom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>apprehensive story like that.</v>

79
00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:18.243
<v Speaker 1>By far,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the largest grouping of Kanji is Casei </v>

80
00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:21.503
<v Speaker 1>Emoji.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These are congee that combined semantic </v>

81
00:04:22.841 --> 00:04:25.300
<v Speaker 1>and phonetic elements to make up a new </v>
<v Speaker 1>character.</v>

82
00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:29.440
<v Speaker 1>The phonetic element is derived from the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chinese pronunciation of the Congee,</v>

83
00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:31.540
<v Speaker 1>the own your me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which we'll talk about later.</v>

84
00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:34.240
<v Speaker 1>A good example of case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a Emoji is sheep,</v>

85
00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:35.320
<v Speaker 1>which means poem.</v>

86
00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:37.300
<v Speaker 1>If we look at the left side of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>country,</v>

87
00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:38.163
<v Speaker 1>we see this component which is most </v>
<v Speaker 1>often used in characters that have </v>

88
00:04:40.901 --> 00:04:42.880
<v Speaker 1>something to do with language or </v>
<v Speaker 1>speaking,</v>

89
00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:45.850
<v Speaker 1>such as this one meaning language and </v>
<v Speaker 1>this one,</v>

90
00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:49.120
<v Speaker 1>meaning speaking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we look at the component on the right</v>

91
00:04:49.121 --> 00:04:52.060
<v Speaker 1>side of this country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we see the congee for temple.</v>

92
00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:55.000
<v Speaker 1>This doesn't indicate any semantic </v>
<v Speaker 1>connection to temples,</v>

93
00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:58.510
<v Speaker 1>but rather at serves as an indicator of </v>
<v Speaker 1>how to pronounce this country.</v>

94
00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:02.650
<v Speaker 1>The Chinese pronunciation of this Kanji </v>
<v Speaker 1>for temple is sheep or ge,</v>

95
00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:05.380
<v Speaker 1>and when you see it as a component </v>
<v Speaker 1>within another congee,</v>

96
00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:06.243
<v Speaker 1>it indicates that that Congee is </v>
<v Speaker 1>pronounced as sheet or GE radicals in </v>

97
00:05:10.331 --> 00:05:13.780
<v Speaker 1>the characters we looked at in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>previous example of case a Emoji.</v>

98
00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:16.120
<v Speaker 1>The component on the left is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>radical.</v>

99
00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:17.073
<v Speaker 1>A radical is the main component of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>Kanji that generally provides a clue </v>

100
00:05:20.231 --> 00:05:21.400
<v Speaker 1>about its root meaning.</v>

101
00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:22.383
<v Speaker 1>Some people use the term radical to </v>
<v Speaker 1>refer to any component of a congee like </v>

102
00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:28.060
<v Speaker 1>both of these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but to be precise only.</v>

103
00:05:28.061 --> 00:05:28.894
<v Speaker 1>This element is the radical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'll both can be referred to as </v>

104
00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:35.260
<v Speaker 1>components.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every congee contains one radical.</v>

105
00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:36.153
<v Speaker 1>Some radicals also exist as independent </v>
<v Speaker 1>congee such as this one meaning gold or </v>

106
00:05:39.851 --> 00:05:40.684
<v Speaker 1>money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It appears as a radical with the root </v>

107
00:05:42.131 --> 00:05:42.964
<v Speaker 1>meaning of metal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here we can see it and this congee </v>

108
00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:47.650
<v Speaker 1>meaning iron,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and in this one meaning copper.</v>

109
00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:48.963
<v Speaker 1>Other radicals only exist as an </v>
<v Speaker 1>inseparable component of a Kanji like </v>

110
00:05:52.091 --> 00:05:52.924
<v Speaker 1>this one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which shows that the congee has a </v>

111
00:05:54.191 --> 00:05:57.740
<v Speaker 1>meaning related to movement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like in this congee meaning road,</v>

112
00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:00.380
<v Speaker 1>and this one meaning pass or </v>
<v Speaker 1>communicate.</v>

113
00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:04.370
<v Speaker 1>As for phonetic components,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't appear on all Kanji,</v>

114
00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:08.060
<v Speaker 1>but they appear on many of them and can </v>
<v Speaker 1>be very useful in pronouncing congee.</v>

115
00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:11.960
<v Speaker 1>One example is this one which we saw </v>
<v Speaker 1>before in the Kanji for copper.</v>

116
00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:14.690
<v Speaker 1>This congee on its own is pronounced </v>
<v Speaker 1>dove,</v>

117
00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:17.270
<v Speaker 1>and when you see it as a component in </v>
<v Speaker 1>another country,</v>

118
00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:20.390
<v Speaker 1>it indicates that the pronunciation is </v>
<v Speaker 1>Dole or toll.</v>

119
00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:22.243
<v Speaker 1>As you can see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these congee here have nothing to do </v>

120
00:06:24.021 --> 00:06:26.600
<v Speaker 1>with each other semantically and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>radicals are different.</v>

121
00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:27.583
<v Speaker 1>They're only related in pronunciation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Another quick example is this congee </v>

122
00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:33.830
<v Speaker 1>meaning opposition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's pronounced hun.</v>

123
00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:36.650
<v Speaker 1>Now look at this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Congee meaning cooked rice or meal.</v>

124
00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:39.680
<v Speaker 1>It's also pronounced Han based on that </v>
<v Speaker 1>phonetic element,</v>

125
00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:44.030
<v Speaker 1>and so it was this one meaning sales and</v>
<v Speaker 1>this one meaning printing or publishing.</v>

126
00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:45.980
<v Speaker 1>They're all pronounced time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

127
00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.980
<v Speaker 1>they're sometimes pronounced time </v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes.</v>

128
00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:50.053
<v Speaker 1>What do you mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes the phonetic elements of </v>

129
00:06:51.651 --> 00:06:54.350
<v Speaker 1>congee or based on the Chinese reading </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the Congee,</v>

130
00:06:54.410 --> 00:06:55.243
<v Speaker 1>also known as the O'neill meet reading </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you'll meet just means reading by </v>

131
00:06:58.581 --> 00:07:01.730
<v Speaker 1>the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>own Naomi and Naomi.</v>

132
00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:04.820
<v Speaker 1>If you remember from my previous video </v>
<v Speaker 1>on Japanese,</v>

133
00:07:04.850 --> 00:07:07.100
<v Speaker 1>there are two basic ways to pronounce </v>
<v Speaker 1>congee.</v>

134
00:07:07.250 --> 00:07:10.250
<v Speaker 1>Own Naomi Chinese derived readings and </v>
<v Speaker 1>couldn't.</v>

135
00:07:10.251 --> 00:07:12.890
<v Speaker 1>You'll meet native Japanese readings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example.</v>

136
00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:13.753
<v Speaker 1>This character has a native couldn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>reading of cutoff while also having the </v>

137
00:07:17.271 --> 00:07:19.850
<v Speaker 1>own reading.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hen when used in this word,</v>

138
00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:20.833
<v Speaker 1>hemp meaning a broken piece.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The own Naomi is used when used in this </v>

139
00:07:24.141 --> 00:07:24.974
<v Speaker 1>word Khatami,</v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning each way the native Naomi is </v>

140
00:07:28.041 --> 00:07:28.874
<v Speaker 1>used.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The real complexity comes with the </v>

141
00:07:32.091 --> 00:07:36.320
<v Speaker 1>congee that have multiple own readings </v>
<v Speaker 1>and multiple coon readings requiring you</v>

142
00:07:36.321 --> 00:07:38.990
<v Speaker 1>to choose the correct reading based on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the context.</v>

143
00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:42.440
<v Speaker 1>One example is this congee meaning life </v>
<v Speaker 1>or birth.</v>

144
00:07:42.770 --> 00:07:45.920
<v Speaker 1>It has to own your meter readings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say and show.</v>

145
00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:48.050
<v Speaker 1>So we have this word,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gene said,</v>

146
00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:53.260
<v Speaker 1>meaning human life and this word to show</v>
<v Speaker 1>which means beast or it,</v>

147
00:07:53.780 --> 00:07:56.030
<v Speaker 1>and it also has numerous Cuneo Naomi </v>
<v Speaker 1>readings.</v>

148
00:07:56.060 --> 00:07:59.480
<v Speaker 1>Here are some examples.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a key to meaning to live.</v>

149
00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:04.610
<v Speaker 1>There's a meaning to give birth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's meaning to grow.</v>

150
00:08:04.700 --> 00:08:07.880
<v Speaker 1>There's higher meaning to grow or spring</v>
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>

151
00:08:08.100 --> 00:08:13.100
<v Speaker 1>There's key meaning pure or raw,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's no meaning raw or uncooked.</v>

152
00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:14.713
<v Speaker 1>As you can see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not always a simple matter of one </v>

153
00:08:16.791 --> 00:08:21.290
<v Speaker 1>conduit being equivalent to one word.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The congee is used to represent the core</v>

154
00:08:21.291 --> 00:08:24.170
<v Speaker 1>meaning of the word,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when we use them for native Japanese</v>

155
00:08:24.171 --> 00:08:26.260
<v Speaker 1>verbs and adjectives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a string of Uba,</v>

156
00:08:26.270 --> 00:08:29.720
<v Speaker 1>Ghana is attached to the end to </v>
<v Speaker 1>represent the inflection of the word.</v>

157
00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:32.390
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's look at the adjective for cold.</v>

158
00:08:32.450 --> 00:08:33.950
<v Speaker 1>Some Louie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as you can see,</v>

159
00:08:33.980 --> 00:08:36.890
<v Speaker 1>there's a congee and the additional </v>
<v Speaker 1>Gunna he.</v>

160
00:08:37.130 --> 00:08:37.963
<v Speaker 1>The congee,</v>
<v Speaker 1>carries the core meaning of the word </v>

161
00:08:39.530 --> 00:08:41.330
<v Speaker 1>while the inflection shown,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he had a gun.</v>

162
00:08:41.331 --> 00:08:46.100
<v Speaker 1>It shows us that this word is in the non</v>
<v Speaker 1>past positive form for an adjective,</v>

163
00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:47.113
<v Speaker 1>so we read this as some wheat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when we inflect this word in the </v>

164
00:08:49.731 --> 00:08:53.930
<v Speaker 1>negative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it becomes where crew night replaces eat</v>

165
00:08:54.020 --> 00:08:56.250
<v Speaker 1>to indicate the non negative form.</v>

166
00:08:56.430 --> 00:08:57.263
<v Speaker 1>When we look at this word,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we know to read it as someone who night </v>

167
00:08:59.550 --> 00:09:00.383
<v Speaker 1>with the first two syllables represented</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the congee and the others placed </v>

168
00:09:03.751 --> 00:09:05.640
<v Speaker 1>after it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To show inflection comes,</v>

169
00:09:05.641 --> 00:09:06.474
<v Speaker 1>you also worked this way with verbs were</v>
<v Speaker 1>the congee will represent the core </v>

170
00:09:09.211 --> 00:09:11.970
<v Speaker 1>meaning of the verb and the heat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I gonna represent the verbs,</v>

171
00:09:11.971 --> 00:09:12.804
<v Speaker 1>conjugations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why bother using congee if part of the </v>

172
00:09:15.241 --> 00:09:16.074
<v Speaker 1>writing is in Hida anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though congee take a lot of effort </v>

173
00:09:19.141 --> 00:09:19.974
<v Speaker 1>to learn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they actually make the entire language </v>

174
00:09:21.630 --> 00:09:24.840
<v Speaker 1>easier to read.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's take a look at an example sentence</v>

175
00:09:24.870 --> 00:09:27.990
<v Speaker 1>first written without congee and next </v>
<v Speaker 1>written with congee.</v>

176
00:09:28.140 --> 00:09:31.510
<v Speaker 1>This sentence means I eat Japanese food </v>
<v Speaker 1>book wash,</v>

177
00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:32.580
<v Speaker 1>Tub,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Amos,</v>

178
00:09:32.580 --> 00:09:35.190
<v Speaker 1>because Japanese is written without </v>
<v Speaker 1>spaces,</v>

179
00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:36.113
<v Speaker 1>without the congee.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The words all blend together and it's </v>

180
00:09:38.101 --> 00:09:38.934
<v Speaker 1>sometimes difficult to quickly see where</v>
<v Speaker 1>one word ends and where the next word </v>

181
00:09:41.851 --> 00:09:42.684
<v Speaker 1>begins or it's difficult to see what </v>
<v Speaker 1>part of speech or where it is congee or </v>

182
00:09:45.901 --> 00:09:48.900
<v Speaker 1>not really read,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but just recognized like symbols.</v>

183
00:09:48.930 --> 00:09:51.600
<v Speaker 1>So they allow you to quickly skim a </v>
<v Speaker 1>sentence for meeting,</v>

184
00:09:52.620 --> 00:09:55.260
<v Speaker 1>but while Congee make Japanese easier to</v>
<v Speaker 1>read,</v>

185
00:09:55.261 --> 00:09:56.094
<v Speaker 1>once you know them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they make Japanese much harder to write </v>

186
00:09:58.290 --> 00:09:59.820
<v Speaker 1>by hand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As you can see,</v>

187
00:09:59.850 --> 00:10:03.420
<v Speaker 1>some congee consist of lots of different</v>
<v Speaker 1>lines or strokes.</v>

188
00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:04.800
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this congee,</v>

189
00:10:04.830 --> 00:10:08.430
<v Speaker 1>meaning machine or opportunity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has 16 strokes.</v>

190
00:10:13.970 --> 00:10:16.940
<v Speaker 1>This one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning appraise has 23 strokes.</v>

191
00:10:21.490 --> 00:10:22.323
<v Speaker 1>If we dig back into some historical </v>
<v Speaker 1>Kanji that are not part of the current </v>

192
00:10:25.270 --> 00:10:28.330
<v Speaker 1>Joel Congee,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of them have quite a high number of</v>

193
00:10:28.331 --> 00:10:29.620
<v Speaker 1>strokes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This congee,</v>

194
00:10:29.621 --> 00:10:32.320
<v Speaker 1>meaning rough or crude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has 33 strokes.</v>

195
00:10:32.470 --> 00:10:33.303
<v Speaker 1>You can see that this one is actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>created through reduplicate of the same </v>

196
00:10:36.371 --> 00:10:39.010
<v Speaker 1>component three times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That component is the congee,</v>

197
00:10:39.011 --> 00:10:39.850
<v Speaker 1>meaning deer.</v>

198
00:10:41.030 --> 00:10:43.730
<v Speaker 1>Here's another conduit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning dragons on the move,</v>

199
00:10:43.790 --> 00:10:44.623
<v Speaker 1>which has 48 strokes and consists of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>congee for dragon reduplicated three </v>

200
00:10:48.711 --> 00:10:49.544
<v Speaker 1>times as components,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this congee features the same </v>

201
00:10:52.851 --> 00:10:55.850
<v Speaker 1>component four times for a total of 64 </v>
<v Speaker 1>strokes.</v>

202
00:10:56.090 --> 00:10:56.923
<v Speaker 1>It means verbose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The biggest freak show of a congee is </v>

203
00:11:00.261 --> 00:11:01.094
<v Speaker 1>this one with 84 strokes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It features this congee as a component </v>

204
00:11:04.940 --> 00:11:08.000
<v Speaker 1>which is itself a rigid application of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the congee for cloud,</v>

205
00:11:08.270 --> 00:11:10.370
<v Speaker 1>and it also features the dragons on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>move.</v>

206
00:11:10.371 --> 00:11:11.204
<v Speaker 1>Congee as a component.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think the origins or usage of </v>

207
00:11:14.121 --> 00:11:14.954
<v Speaker 1>this country are very clear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it may have been used in personal </v>

208
00:11:17.391 --> 00:11:19.950
<v Speaker 1>names.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These high stroke congee are very rare.</v>

209
00:11:19.990 --> 00:11:23.660
<v Speaker 1>They're not really used anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but congee have up to 20 strokes or even</v>

210
00:11:23.661 --> 00:11:24.494
<v Speaker 1>a little higher are quite common.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not only do you have to remember the </v>

211
00:11:27.231 --> 00:11:28.064
<v Speaker 1>strokes themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you have to write them in the </v>

212
00:11:29.361 --> 00:11:31.220
<v Speaker 1>correct order in the correct direction.</v>

213
00:11:31.460 --> 00:11:33.740
<v Speaker 1>There are a series of rules that govern </v>
<v Speaker 1>stroke order.</v>

214
00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:38.330
<v Speaker 1>The most basic rule is top to bottom and</v>
<v Speaker 1>left to right with the congee for river,</v>

215
00:11:38.360 --> 00:11:41.090
<v Speaker 1>we can see that you write a stroke from </v>
<v Speaker 1>top to bottom,</v>

216
00:11:41.210 --> 00:11:43.790
<v Speaker 1>then you move to the right and add two </v>
<v Speaker 1>more strokes,</v>

217
00:11:43.910 --> 00:11:46.580
<v Speaker 1>but the first stroke seems to go from </v>
<v Speaker 1>right to left.</v>

218
00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:48.380
<v Speaker 1>That's true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but here are the top to bottom.</v>

219
00:11:48.381 --> 00:11:49.214
<v Speaker 1>Rule takes precedence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so this has allowed the next when </v>

220
00:11:52.131 --> 00:11:52.964
<v Speaker 1>vertical and horizontal cross,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the horizontal line is usually written </v>

221
00:11:56.351 --> 00:11:59.020
<v Speaker 1>first.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can see this in the congee for 10.</v>

222
00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:01.353
<v Speaker 1>Next,</v>
<v Speaker 1>vertical strokes that cross through </v>

223
00:12:02.771 --> 00:12:05.800
<v Speaker 1>other strokes are written after the </v>
<v Speaker 1>strokes they cross through.</v>

224
00:12:05.950 --> 00:12:06.783
<v Speaker 1>We can see this in the congee,</v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning middle or in horizontal strokes </v>

225
00:12:10.691 --> 00:12:12.910
<v Speaker 1>that cross through other strokes are </v>
<v Speaker 1>written last.</v>

226
00:12:12.970 --> 00:12:14.830
<v Speaker 1>We can see this in the congee for </v>
<v Speaker 1>mother.</v>

227
00:12:15.670 --> 00:12:16.503
<v Speaker 1>Next diagonal strokes are written right </v>
<v Speaker 1>to left before left to right as we can </v>

228
00:12:20.231 --> 00:12:22.570
<v Speaker 1>see in the congee meaning letter or </v>
<v Speaker 1>writings.</v>

229
00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:24.753
<v Speaker 1>Next,</v>
<v Speaker 1>central vertical strokes are written </v>

230
00:12:26.651 --> 00:12:29.560
<v Speaker 1>before their wings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can see this in the country,</v>

231
00:12:29.561 --> 00:12:30.394
<v Speaker 1>meaning water.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Next left vertical strokes are written </v>

232
00:12:34.061 --> 00:12:37.630
<v Speaker 1>before strokes that go across and down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As we can see in the congee,</v>

233
00:12:37.631 --> 00:12:38.464
<v Speaker 1>meaning mouth this across a downstroke </v>
<v Speaker 1>is quite common and it's important not </v>

234
00:12:42.461 --> 00:12:44.920
<v Speaker 1>to mistake it for two strokes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just one stroke.</v>

235
00:12:45.820 --> 00:12:49.780
<v Speaker 1>Next enclosures are normally written </v>
<v Speaker 1>before the components inside them.</v>

236
00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:52.240
<v Speaker 1>We can see that in the congee,</v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning wide.</v>

237
00:12:54.040 --> 00:12:54.873
<v Speaker 1>An exception to that is some enclosures </v>
<v Speaker 1>that have a bottom stroke which are </v>

238
00:12:57.581 --> 00:12:59.920
<v Speaker 1>written last.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can see this in the congee,</v>

239
00:12:59.921 --> 00:13:00.790
<v Speaker 1>meaning near</v>

240
00:13:03.090 --> 00:13:06.840
<v Speaker 1>and short little strokes or dashes are </v>
<v Speaker 1>often written last,</v>

241
00:13:06.900 --> 00:13:09.330
<v Speaker 1>even if that contradicts the top to </v>
<v Speaker 1>bottom rule.</v>

242
00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:11.820
<v Speaker 1>We can see this in the country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning seek.</v>

243
00:13:13.110 --> 00:13:13.943
<v Speaker 1>Most of these stroke order rules become </v>
<v Speaker 1>second nature after awhile if you </v>

244
00:13:16.621 --> 00:13:17.454
<v Speaker 1>practice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I must admit that I hardly ever </v>

245
00:13:19.351 --> 00:13:20.184
<v Speaker 1>write Kanji by hand these days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These days people type on their </v>

246
00:13:22.321 --> 00:13:25.320
<v Speaker 1>smartphones and computers a lot more </v>
<v Speaker 1>than they write by hand.</v>

247
00:13:26.310 --> 00:13:28.620
<v Speaker 1>When typing congee on a smart phone or </v>
<v Speaker 1>computer,</v>

248
00:13:28.650 --> 00:13:29.483
<v Speaker 1>you type the phonetic pronunciation and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then a list of congee with that </v>

249
00:13:32.131 --> 00:13:35.010
<v Speaker 1>pronunciation appears and you choose the</v>
<v Speaker 1>appropriate one.</v>

250
00:13:35.220 --> 00:13:36.053
<v Speaker 1>A well known result of this reliance on </v>
<v Speaker 1>technology is that Japanese speakers </v>

251
00:13:39.091 --> 00:13:41.670
<v Speaker 1>ability to write Kanji by hand has </v>
<v Speaker 1>declined.</v>

252
00:13:41.850 --> 00:13:44.910
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty common to see someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>filling out a form or something and then</v>

253
00:13:44.911 --> 00:13:47.670
<v Speaker 1>pull out a smartphone to check how to </v>
<v Speaker 1>write a certain congee.</v>

254
00:13:48.990 --> 00:13:52.590
<v Speaker 1>It's important to point out that not </v>
<v Speaker 1>every native speaker of Japanese will be</v>

255
00:13:52.591 --> 00:13:55.620
<v Speaker 1>able to read every Kanji character that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they encountered,</v>

256
00:13:55.770 --> 00:13:58.020
<v Speaker 1>especially in place names or personal </v>
<v Speaker 1>names.</v>

257
00:13:58.200 --> 00:13:59.033
<v Speaker 1>It's not uncommon for me to ask a native</v>
<v Speaker 1>speaker how to pronounce the name of a </v>

258
00:14:01.861 --> 00:14:03.000
<v Speaker 1>place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

259
00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:04.950
<v Speaker 1>and for them to tell me that they don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

260
00:14:05.220 --> 00:14:09.030
<v Speaker 1>but they can often give it a shot based </v>
<v Speaker 1>on what looks like a phonetic element in</v>

261
00:14:09.031 --> 00:14:11.160
<v Speaker 1>the congee and if they don't know the </v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning,</v>

262
00:14:11.161 --> 00:14:11.994
<v Speaker 1>they might be able to guess the general </v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning based on the radical of the </v>

263
00:14:14.581 --> 00:14:15.414
<v Speaker 1>congee.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While learning congee is time consuming </v>

264
00:14:17.191 --> 00:14:18.024
<v Speaker 1>and may seem overwhelming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Remember that congee or a part of </v>

265
00:14:20.161 --> 00:14:22.830
<v Speaker 1>Japanese culture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>history and literature,</v>

266
00:14:22.980 --> 00:14:26.760
<v Speaker 1>and if you treat them like a puzzle to </v>
<v Speaker 1>solve or a mystery to unravel,</v>

267
00:14:26.820 --> 00:14:30.780
<v Speaker 1>then it becomes much more motivating and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the congee seem much less intimidating.</v>

268
00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:34.300
<v Speaker 1>The question of the day for native </v>
<v Speaker 1>speakers of Japanese,</v>

269
00:14:34.450 --> 00:14:37.330
<v Speaker 1>do you think congee are necessary for </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Japanese language?</v>

270
00:14:37.570 --> 00:14:40.510
<v Speaker 1>Would you be able to speak Japanese the </v>
<v Speaker 1>same as you do now?</v>

271
00:14:40.511 --> 00:14:43.520
<v Speaker 1>If congee,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're not a part of the language and for</v>

272
00:14:43.521 --> 00:14:46.760
<v Speaker 1>learners of Japanese,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how much of a challenge or Kanji for you</v>

273
00:14:46.910 --> 00:14:50.100
<v Speaker 1>and how do you deal with the challenge?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Be sure to follow Lang,</v>

274
00:14:50.110 --> 00:14:51.740
<v Speaker 1>focus on facebook,</v>

275
00:14:51.741 --> 00:14:53.480
