00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:01.793
<v Speaker 1>Hello everyone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>welcome to the Lange Focus Channel and </v>

2
00:00:03.781 --> 00:00:04.614
<v Speaker 1>my name is Paul.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Today's topic is the languages of South </v>

3
00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:11.670
<v Speaker 1>Africa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Republic of South Africa covers much</v>

4
00:00:11.671 --> 00:00:12.504
<v Speaker 1>of the southern tip of the African </v>
<v Speaker 1>continent and as a place where numerous </v>

5
00:00:15.541 --> 00:00:16.374
<v Speaker 1>native African cultures as well as </v>
<v Speaker 1>former colonial populations have </v>

6
00:00:19.231 --> 00:00:22.740
<v Speaker 1>converged resulting in a state of true </v>
<v Speaker 1>linguistic diversity.</v>

7
00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:24.023
<v Speaker 1>South Africa has 11 official languages </v>
<v Speaker 1>that have been recognized in its </v>

8
00:00:27.031 --> 00:00:30.750
<v Speaker 1>constitution since 1993.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If that seems like a lot to you,</v>

9
00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:33.930
<v Speaker 1>you're probably right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>South Africa is among the countries with</v>

10
00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.080
<v Speaker 1>the largest number of official languages</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the national level.</v>

11
00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.760
<v Speaker 1>Number one is actually neighboring </v>
<v Speaker 1>Zimbabwe with 16 official languages,</v>

12
00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.190
<v Speaker 1>some of which are also official in South</v>
<v Speaker 1>Africa.</v>

13
00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:45.443
<v Speaker 1>These are the 11 official languages of </v>
<v Speaker 1>South Africa in order of most spoken to </v>

14
00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:51.450
<v Speaker 1>least spoken as a first language,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Zulu,</v>

15
00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:53.490
<v Speaker 1>Hosa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Afrikaans,</v>

16
00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.440
<v Speaker 1>English,</v>
<v Speaker 1>northern Sudan,</v>

17
00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:57.180
<v Speaker 1>Swana,</v>
<v Speaker 1>southern Sudan,</v>

18
00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:58.800
<v Speaker 1>Tsonga,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Swazi,</v>

19
00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.100
<v Speaker 1>venda,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and in the ballet,</v>

20
00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:02.393
<v Speaker 1>over 99 percent of South Africans to </v>
<v Speaker 1>speak one of these languages as a first </v>

21
00:01:05.581 --> 00:01:06.390
<v Speaker 1>language.</v>

22
00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:07.223
<v Speaker 1>All of these languages are members of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the southern through branch of the </v>

23
00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:11.213
<v Speaker 1>Nigeria Congo language family,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the exception of Afrikaans and </v>

24
00:01:13.321 --> 00:01:15.290
<v Speaker 1>English,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which are Germanic languages,</v>

25
00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:16.163
<v Speaker 1>brought to the country by Europeans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Dutch first arrived in what is now </v>

26
00:01:19.411 --> 00:01:20.244
<v Speaker 1>South Africa in 16,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fifty two establishing the Cape colony </v>

27
00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:24.173
<v Speaker 1>in the western portion of the country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Also living in this area were native </v>

28
00:01:27.391 --> 00:01:30.690
<v Speaker 1>Koyczan people and other Africans who </v>
<v Speaker 1>spoke two languages.</v>

29
00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:34.170
<v Speaker 1>The British seized control of the Cape </v>
<v Speaker 1>Colony in 18,</v>

30
00:01:34.171 --> 00:01:38.100
<v Speaker 1>15 and British settlers began to arrive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The brewers,</v>

31
00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:38.993
<v Speaker 1>the descendants of the original Dutch </v>
<v Speaker 1>settlers disliked many aspects of </v>

32
00:01:41.971 --> 00:01:44.700
<v Speaker 1>British rule,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but one of them was the anglicization of</v>

33
00:01:44.701 --> 00:01:45.534
<v Speaker 1>the Cape Colony and the attempt to force</v>
<v Speaker 1>English on the horse as a medium of </v>

34
00:01:48.481 --> 00:01:49.314
<v Speaker 1>instruction in schools.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They wanted to continue to use Dutch as </v>

35
00:01:51.991 --> 00:01:54.720
<v Speaker 1>their medium of instruction and to </v>
<v Speaker 1>continue speaking.</v>

36
00:01:54.721 --> 00:01:57.360
<v Speaker 1>They're distinct dialect of Dutch called</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cape Dutch,</v>

37
00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.640
<v Speaker 1>which would later evolve into Afrikaans.</v>

38
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:00.833
<v Speaker 1>Boris began the great trek migrating </v>
<v Speaker 1>inland and creating their own bore </v>

39
00:02:04.111 --> 00:02:04.944
<v Speaker 1>republics in an area more densely </v>
<v Speaker 1>populated with African tribes who spoke </v>

40
00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:09.353
<v Speaker 1>two languages.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The British later took control of the </v>

41
00:02:11.821 --> 00:02:16.530
<v Speaker 1>board republics and created the Union of</v>
<v Speaker 1>South Africa in 1910 that eventually led</v>

42
00:02:16.531 --> 00:02:18.870
<v Speaker 1>to the creation of the Republic of South</v>
<v Speaker 1>Africa.</v>

43
00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.510
<v Speaker 1>From that point on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there were two official languages,</v>

44
00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:22.403
<v Speaker 1>English and Dutch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but Dutch as spoken by the boers had </v>

45
00:02:24.751 --> 00:02:27.630
<v Speaker 1>evolved into a distinct language called </v>
<v Speaker 1>Afrikaans,</v>

46
00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:31.080
<v Speaker 1>which replaced Dutch as an official </v>
<v Speaker 1>language in 1925.</v>

47
00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:32.483
<v Speaker 1>These two colonial languages became the </v>
<v Speaker 1>prestige languages of South Africa and </v>

48
00:02:35.821 --> 00:02:36.654
<v Speaker 1>Speakers of other languages.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Didn't really have any say in the </v>

49
00:02:38.431 --> 00:02:40.230
<v Speaker 1>matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>During the apartheid era,</v>

50
00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.720
<v Speaker 1>schools were segregated not only based </v>
<v Speaker 1>on race,</v>

51
00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:46.620
<v Speaker 1>but also based on mother tongue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Native speakers of English and Afrikaans</v>

52
00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:49.020
<v Speaker 1>were taught in their native language </v>
<v Speaker 1>throughout their schooling.</v>

53
00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:52.020
<v Speaker 1>With second language instruction in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>other official language,</v>

54
00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:56.790
<v Speaker 1>black South Africans were required to </v>
<v Speaker 1>study in their mother tongue for most of</v>

55
00:02:56.791 --> 00:03:00.430
<v Speaker 1>their primary school years after which </v>
<v Speaker 1>point then normally studied in English.</v>

56
00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:02.073
<v Speaker 1>But in 1974,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the apartheid government implemented a </v>

57
00:03:04.451 --> 00:03:05.284
<v Speaker 1>new policy requiring instruction in </v>
<v Speaker 1>black schools to be conducted in a 50 </v>

58
00:03:08.591 --> 00:03:10.990
<v Speaker 1>slash 50 split between English and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Afrikaans.</v>

59
00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:13.480
<v Speaker 1>With the language of instruction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>depending on the course,</v>

60
00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:14.613
<v Speaker 1>this was implemented without consulting </v>
<v Speaker 1>the black population in opposition to </v>

61
00:03:17.681 --> 00:03:21.250
<v Speaker 1>this move led to the Soweto uprising of </v>
<v Speaker 1>1976.</v>

62
00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:24.670
<v Speaker 1>Afrikaans was seen as the language of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the oppressor.</v>

63
00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:25.563
<v Speaker 1>Since the apartheid government was </v>
<v Speaker 1>dominated by white speakers of </v>

64
00:03:27.851 --> 00:03:28.684
<v Speaker 1>Afrikaans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>while English was seen as a more </v>

65
00:03:30.101 --> 00:03:30.934
<v Speaker 1>cosmopolitan language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When apartheid ended in the early 19 </v>

66
00:03:33.761 --> 00:03:34.594
<v Speaker 1>nineties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a new constitution was written that </v>

67
00:03:35.951 --> 00:03:36.784
<v Speaker 1>added nine additional African languages </v>
<v Speaker 1>as official languages in order to be </v>

68
00:03:39.881 --> 00:03:40.714
<v Speaker 1>more inclusive of the entire population.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The education system now is based on </v>

69
00:03:44.441 --> 00:03:45.274
<v Speaker 1>freedom of choice with every individual </v>
<v Speaker 1>free to choose which of the 11 official </v>

70
00:03:48.761 --> 00:03:51.790
<v Speaker 1>languages to be educated in for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>first part of their schooling.</v>

71
00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:55.000
<v Speaker 1>As long as there's sufficient demand for</v>
<v Speaker 1>the school to provide it,</v>

72
00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:55.933
<v Speaker 1>that means that they don't have to study</v>
<v Speaker 1>in their mother tongue if they don't </v>

73
00:03:58.121 --> 00:03:58.954
<v Speaker 1>want to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's take a look at the map of South </v>

74
00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:02.950
<v Speaker 1>Africa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When apartheid was abolished,</v>

75
00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:03.813
<v Speaker 1>the four provinces of South Africa and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the homelands enclaves for African </v>

76
00:04:07.301 --> 00:04:10.810
<v Speaker 1>ethnic groups were abolished and nine </v>
<v Speaker 1>new provinces were created.</v>

77
00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:12.003
<v Speaker 1>This map shows the most dominant </v>
<v Speaker 1>languages in South Africa down to the </v>

78
00:04:14.591 --> 00:04:15.424
<v Speaker 1>local level.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can see that the 11 official </v>

79
00:04:17.051 --> 00:04:17.884
<v Speaker 1>languages are clustered mainly in </v>
<v Speaker 1>certain areas and may predominate in </v>

80
00:04:20.771 --> 00:04:21.604
<v Speaker 1>certain provinces,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they don't correspond exactly to </v>

81
00:04:23.591 --> 00:04:24.424
<v Speaker 1>provincial borders.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can see that Afrikaans predominates </v>

82
00:04:26.651 --> 00:04:27.484
<v Speaker 1>in the West while the [inaudible] </v>
<v Speaker 1>language is predominate in the east and </v>

83
00:04:30.551 --> 00:04:33.580
<v Speaker 1>English predominates in South Africa's </v>
<v Speaker 1>major urban centers.</v>

84
00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:35.793
<v Speaker 1>As you can see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's quite an intricate linguistic </v>

85
00:04:37.251 --> 00:04:39.370
<v Speaker 1>situation in the eastern part of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>country,</v>

86
00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:42.070
<v Speaker 1>so let's zoom in and look at the African</v>
<v Speaker 1>languages there.</v>

87
00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:43.113
<v Speaker 1>As I mentioned earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Non European languages of South </v>

88
00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:48.970
<v Speaker 1>Africa are mainly members of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>southern Bantu branch of the Niger Congo</v>

89
00:04:48.971 --> 00:04:49.804
<v Speaker 1>language family,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and these account for about 70 percent </v>

90
00:04:51.821 --> 00:04:54.520
<v Speaker 1>of the population or around 40 million </v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

91
00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:55.683
<v Speaker 1>These southern through languages display</v>
<v Speaker 1>some features typical of the languages </v>

92
00:04:58.930 --> 00:04:59.763
<v Speaker 1>in general.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They follow an Svo word order like </v>

93
00:05:02.041 --> 00:05:02.874
<v Speaker 1>almost all Bantu through languages.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're tonal and they're are largely a </v>

94
00:05:05.521 --> 00:05:09.180
<v Speaker 1>gluten active and feature a large number</v>
<v Speaker 1>of affixes to nouns and verbs.</v>

95
00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:12.690
<v Speaker 1>Most Ben,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two languages do not have click sounds,</v>

96
00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:13.793
<v Speaker 1>but many of these southern Bantu </v>
<v Speaker 1>language is due as a result of contact </v>

97
00:05:16.651 --> 00:05:17.484
<v Speaker 1>with the Koyczan languages.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The nine main southern Bantu languages </v>

98
00:05:20.711 --> 00:05:21.544
<v Speaker 1>of South Africa can be further </v>
<v Speaker 1>categorized into three smaller </v>

99
00:05:23.861 --> 00:05:26.230
<v Speaker 1>subdivisions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the in Goonie languages,</v>

100
00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:30.050
<v Speaker 1>the languages and the Swat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ranga or someone,</v>

101
00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:30.893
<v Speaker 1>God group vendor forms its own group,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so there are actually four subdivisions </v>

102
00:05:34.791 --> 00:05:35.690
<v Speaker 1>including this one.</v>

103
00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:37.273
<v Speaker 1>The goonie branch of the southern Bantu </v>
<v Speaker 1>tree contains four of South Africa's </v>

104
00:05:40.341 --> 00:05:42.020
<v Speaker 1>official languages,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Zulu,</v>

105
00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:43.760
<v Speaker 1>Olsa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Swazi,</v>

106
00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:44.923
<v Speaker 1>and the belay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first two are the two most spoken </v>

107
00:05:47.031 --> 00:05:47.864
<v Speaker 1>languages within South Africa as a first</v>
<v Speaker 1>language with Zulu representing 23 </v>

108
00:05:51.441 --> 00:05:55.700
<v Speaker 1>percent of the population and wholesale </v>
<v Speaker 1>representing 16 percent of it.</v>

109
00:05:55.940 --> 00:06:00.020
<v Speaker 1>The other two on the other are spoken by</v>
<v Speaker 1>only two point five percent in two point</v>

110
00:06:00.021 --> 00:06:04.370
<v Speaker 1>one percent respectively.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Zulu is mainly spoken in Kwazulu,</v>

111
00:06:04.371 --> 00:06:05.204
<v Speaker 1>Natal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and most of Puma Langa where Swazi and </v>

112
00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:08.873
<v Speaker 1>in the belay are spoken as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wholesale is the majority language of </v>

113
00:06:12.171 --> 00:06:13.004
<v Speaker 1>the Eastern Cape,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but has communities have speakers in </v>

114
00:06:14.901 --> 00:06:17.540
<v Speaker 1>other provinces as well as other </v>
<v Speaker 1>official languages.</v>

115
00:06:17.541 --> 00:06:21.320
<v Speaker 1>Do the Goonie languages feature?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Click consonants.</v>

116
00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:23.900
<v Speaker 1>You can hear one of them in the name of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the language.</v>

117
00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:25.813
<v Speaker 1>Actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is the first time I've tried to </v>

118
00:06:26.901 --> 00:06:27.734
<v Speaker 1>pronounce a click consonant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I may be pronouncing the name of the </v>

119
00:06:30.021 --> 00:06:32.450
<v Speaker 1>language wrong from the point of view of</v>
<v Speaker 1>a native speaker,</v>

120
00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:35.000
<v Speaker 1>but I guess it's something like that </v>
<v Speaker 1>whole song.</v>

121
00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:39.670
<v Speaker 1>All of the in Goonie languages are </v>
<v Speaker 1>mutually intelligible to a large extent,</v>

122
00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:43.920
<v Speaker 1>so to Twana.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The second largest of the southern Bantu</v>

123
00:06:43.921 --> 00:06:47.490
<v Speaker 1>branches is the [inaudible] branch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which has three languages within it.</v>

124
00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:48.513
<v Speaker 1>Northern [inaudible] representing nine </v>
<v Speaker 1>point one percent of South Africa's </v>

125
00:06:51.211 --> 00:06:54.600
<v Speaker 1>population Swana with eight percent and </v>
<v Speaker 1>southern Sudan,</v>

126
00:06:54.690 --> 00:06:58.260
<v Speaker 1>or simply with seven point six percent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Altogether.</v>

127
00:06:58.261 --> 00:07:01.710
<v Speaker 1>They represent just under a quarter of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the population of South Africa,</v>

128
00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:02.633
<v Speaker 1>around 13 point 6 million people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Each of these three languages serves as </v>

129
00:07:06.711 --> 00:07:10.670
<v Speaker 1>the majority language in the province </v>
<v Speaker 1>that it's most widely spoken in southern</v>

130
00:07:10.671 --> 00:07:14.060
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] in the free state,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not in the northwest province,</v>

131
00:07:14.450 --> 00:07:15.283
<v Speaker 1>and there is also a significant </v>
<v Speaker 1>population of speakers in the Northern </v>

132
00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:20.900
<v Speaker 1>Cape with which it shares a border and </v>
<v Speaker 1>to northern Sudan.</v>

133
00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:21.753
<v Speaker 1>In Limpopo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>southern [inaudible] contains click </v>

134
00:07:24.521 --> 00:07:27.220
<v Speaker 1>consonants due to contact with an Goonie</v>
<v Speaker 1>languages.</v>

135
00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:28.263
<v Speaker 1>While some urban varieties of northern </v>
<v Speaker 1>sue to have in recent times been </v>

136
00:07:30.941 --> 00:07:34.240
<v Speaker 1>acquiring clicks as well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's one that uses some click sounds,</v>

137
00:07:34.270 --> 00:07:37.510
<v Speaker 1>but only in interjections and video </v>
<v Speaker 1>phones on the metal,</v>

138
00:07:37.780 --> 00:07:40.750
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and like the Goonie languages,</v>

139
00:07:40.780 --> 00:07:44.470
<v Speaker 1>the Twana languages are generally </v>
<v Speaker 1>mutually intelligible as well.</v>

140
00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:46.193
<v Speaker 1>Tsonga or Swati Rhondda,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although there are other languages </v>

141
00:07:48.811 --> 00:07:52.020
<v Speaker 1>within this branch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the only one that has official status is</v>

142
00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:52.933
<v Speaker 1>Tsonga.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Other languages of this group are </v>

143
00:07:54.331 --> 00:07:55.164
<v Speaker 1>mutually intelligible and are oftentimes</v>
<v Speaker 1>considered part of the tone of the </v>

144
00:07:57.571 --> 00:08:01.350
<v Speaker 1>language found in the northeast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most of the Tsongas speaking,</v>

145
00:08:01.351 --> 00:08:06.351
<v Speaker 1>people live in Limpopo or Puma Malanga.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some features click sounds in just a few</v>

146
00:08:06.630 --> 00:08:08.940
<v Speaker 1>words.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Another interesting phonological feature</v>

147
00:08:08.941 --> 00:08:09.774
<v Speaker 1>is whistled sibilant consonants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I haven't been able to find a sample </v>

148
00:08:12.751 --> 00:08:13.584
<v Speaker 1>from Tonga,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but here's a sample of a similar sound </v>

149
00:08:15.331 --> 00:08:16.500
<v Speaker 1>in the [inaudible] language</v>

150
00:08:27.370 --> 00:08:28.203
<v Speaker 1>vendor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the less spoken of the official </v>

151
00:08:29.831 --> 00:08:30.664
<v Speaker 1>languages in South Africa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Venda comprises two point four percent </v>

152
00:08:33.311 --> 00:08:34.144
<v Speaker 1>of the population or one point $3 </v>
<v Speaker 1>million speakers who are almost all </v>

153
00:08:37.211 --> 00:08:41.830
<v Speaker 1>concentrated on the northern border of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Limpopo near Zimbabwe where it's closest</v>

154
00:08:41.831 --> 00:08:44.440
<v Speaker 1>linguistic relatives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Live vendor has no click.</v>

155
00:08:44.441 --> 00:08:47.190
<v Speaker 1>Sounds okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Afrikaans and English,</v>

156
00:08:47.550 --> 00:08:49.710
<v Speaker 1>the two Germanic languages of South </v>
<v Speaker 1>Africa,</v>

157
00:08:49.860 --> 00:08:50.693
<v Speaker 1>Afrikaans and English or the third and </v>
<v Speaker 1>fourth most spoken languages in the </v>

158
00:08:53.761 --> 00:08:54.594
<v Speaker 1>country with 13,</v>
<v Speaker 1>five percent and nine point six percent </v>

159
00:08:57.511 --> 00:09:00.660
<v Speaker 1>of citizens speaking them as their first</v>
<v Speaker 1>language respectively.</v>

160
00:09:01.110 --> 00:09:01.943
<v Speaker 1>People outside of South Africa might </v>
<v Speaker 1>assume that native speakers of Africans </v>

161
00:09:05.190 --> 00:09:07.050
<v Speaker 1>are all white,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's not the case.</v>

162
00:09:07.530 --> 00:09:09.640
<v Speaker 1>It's the majority language in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Northern Cape.</v>

163
00:09:09.641 --> 00:09:10.474
<v Speaker 1>Then Western Cape provinces where most </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the nation's colored population or </v>

164
00:09:13.530 --> 00:09:14.363
<v Speaker 1>mixed race population lives and more </v>
<v Speaker 1>than 75 percent of colored South </v>

165
00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:20.820
<v Speaker 1>Africans speak Afrikaans as their first </v>
<v Speaker 1>language.</v>

166
00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:22.193
<v Speaker 1>Why is that?</v>

167
00:09:22.620 --> 00:09:25.050
<v Speaker 1>It's because they were part of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>language is development.</v>

168
00:09:25.620 --> 00:09:29.280
<v Speaker 1>The origin of the colored community lies</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the early days of the colony.</v>

169
00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:30.173
<v Speaker 1>When Dutch settlers intermarried with </v>
<v Speaker 1>indigenous Koyczan women or slaves from </v>

170
00:09:33.271 --> 00:09:35.310
<v Speaker 1>Africa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>India and Southeast Asia,</v>

171
00:09:35.670 --> 00:09:36.503
<v Speaker 1>but they also interacted linguistically </v>
<v Speaker 1>and by learning Dutch in perfectly as a </v>

172
00:09:39.631 --> 00:09:40.464
<v Speaker 1>second language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They influenced the direction of the </v>

173
00:09:42.031 --> 00:09:44.730
<v Speaker 1>Dutch dialect that would evolve into </v>
<v Speaker 1>Afrikaans.</v>

174
00:09:44.940 --> 00:09:45.773
<v Speaker 1>It's also spoken as a native language by</v>
<v Speaker 1>smaller numbers of the South Asian and </v>

175
00:09:48.751 --> 00:09:49.584
<v Speaker 1>black South African populations and it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>spoken by over 60 percent of the white </v>

176
00:09:53.131 --> 00:09:55.620
<v Speaker 1>population as a native language in </v>
<v Speaker 1>total.</v>

177
00:09:55.621 --> 00:09:59.940
<v Speaker 1>It's the first language of about 13 </v>
<v Speaker 1>point five percent of the population and</v>

178
00:09:59.941 --> 00:10:02.730
<v Speaker 1>it's spoken by an even larger number as </v>
<v Speaker 1>a second language.</v>

179
00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.990
<v Speaker 1>If you haven't seen my language profile </v>
<v Speaker 1>on Afrikaans from a couple of years ago,</v>

180
00:10:07.020 --> 00:10:11.310
<v Speaker 1>you can check it out right here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>English is spoken as a native language,</v>

181
00:10:11.340 --> 00:10:12.173
<v Speaker 1>mainly in the Western Cape,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how attain and Zulu natal as these are </v>

182
00:10:15.571 --> 00:10:17.310
<v Speaker 1>aware of the major cities can be found.</v>

183
00:10:17.790 --> 00:10:20.190
<v Speaker 1>Plus it's widely spoken as a second </v>
<v Speaker 1>language,</v>

184
00:10:21.180 --> 00:10:24.630
<v Speaker 1>English as the native language of nine </v>
<v Speaker 1>point six percent of the population,</v>

185
00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:27.450
<v Speaker 1>including around 36 percent of the white</v>
<v Speaker 1>population.</v>

186
00:10:27.810 --> 00:10:30.720
<v Speaker 1>It's also the native language of most </v>
<v Speaker 1>Indian South Africans.</v>

187
00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:33.790
<v Speaker 1>They speak with an accent distinct from </v>
<v Speaker 1>white South Africans,</v>

188
00:10:33.791 --> 00:10:36.750
<v Speaker 1>speakers of English during the apartheid</v>
<v Speaker 1>era,</v>

189
00:10:36.810 --> 00:10:40.650
<v Speaker 1>interaction with whites was limited,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which allowed their own distinct variety</v>

190
00:10:40.651 --> 00:10:43.820
<v Speaker 1>of English to develop in isolation with </v>
<v Speaker 1>some fun,</v>

191
00:10:43.821 --> 00:10:46.080
<v Speaker 1>illogical influences from Indian </v>
<v Speaker 1>languages.</v>

192
00:10:47.310 --> 00:10:48.143
<v Speaker 1>I've mentioned the Koyczan languages a </v>
<v Speaker 1>few times and you may be wondering why </v>

193
00:10:51.031 --> 00:10:53.070
<v Speaker 1>they aren't on the list of official </v>
<v Speaker 1>languages.</v>

194
00:10:54.120 --> 00:10:54.953
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Koyczan where the first indigenous </v>

195
00:10:56.341 --> 00:10:57.174
<v Speaker 1>people have much of South Africa before </v>
<v Speaker 1>the migration of Ben to peoples and </v>

196
00:11:00.211 --> 00:11:03.030
<v Speaker 1>later Europeans through conflict with </v>
<v Speaker 1>Ben too,</v>

197
00:11:03.031 --> 00:11:03.864
<v Speaker 1>and Europeans Koyczan were driven into a</v>
<v Speaker 1>much smaller area and now most Koyczan </v>

198
00:11:07.861 --> 00:11:11.940
<v Speaker 1>live in the Kalahari desert.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some Koyczan intermarried with Europeans</v>

199
00:11:11.941 --> 00:11:12.774
<v Speaker 1>and became part of the colored </v>
<v Speaker 1>population while others died from </v>

200
00:11:15.211 --> 00:11:16.410
<v Speaker 1>conflict and disease.</v>

201
00:11:17.370 --> 00:11:18.203
<v Speaker 1>The end result of all this is that only </v>
<v Speaker 1>a very small population of Koyczan </v>

202
00:11:21.271 --> 00:11:22.104
<v Speaker 1>remain in South Africa and their Koyczan</v>
<v Speaker 1>languages are therefore not widely </v>

203
00:11:25.411 --> 00:11:26.244
<v Speaker 1>spoken and are not official languages.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Koyczan languages do not form a single </v>

204
00:11:30.601 --> 00:11:33.900
<v Speaker 1>language family and are not accepted as </v>
<v Speaker 1>being related to each other,</v>

205
00:11:34.110 --> 00:11:37.410
<v Speaker 1>but all of them feature extensive use of</v>
<v Speaker 1>click consonants.</v>

206
00:11:37.740 --> 00:11:39.930
<v Speaker 1>As I stated before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the click sounds used.</v>

207
00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:43.260
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] languages come from contact </v>
<v Speaker 1>with Koyczan languages.</v>

208
00:11:43.620 --> 00:11:44.453
<v Speaker 1>The most widely spoken Koyczan language </v>
<v Speaker 1>in South Africa is [inaudible] or </v>

209
00:11:47.940 --> 00:11:50.640
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] with around 50,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>speakers.</v>

210
00:11:50.910 --> 00:11:55.300
<v Speaker 1>This language has an additional 250,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>speakers in neighboring Namibia.</v>

211
00:11:56.200 --> 00:11:57.033
<v Speaker 1>There are other Koyczan languages in </v>
<v Speaker 1>South Africa that are severely </v>

212
00:11:59.471 --> 00:12:00.304
<v Speaker 1>endangered like Greek,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well with only a few dozen speakers </v>

213
00:12:02.771 --> 00:12:03.604
<v Speaker 1>remaining language in society.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In a society with such linguistic </v>

214
00:12:08.201 --> 00:12:10.630
<v Speaker 1>diversity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's inevitable that the majority of the</v>

215
00:12:10.631 --> 00:12:13.210
<v Speaker 1>population will be bilingual or </v>
<v Speaker 1>multilingual.</v>

216
00:12:13.660 --> 00:12:14.493
<v Speaker 1>Most white and colored South Africans </v>
<v Speaker 1>are bilingual and English and Afrikaans </v>

217
00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:20.980
<v Speaker 1>and a smaller number of speak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the African languages as well,</v>

218
00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:26.130
<v Speaker 1>Indian South African speak English and </v>
<v Speaker 1>usually some Afrikaans and some speak in</v>

219
00:12:26.140 --> 00:12:27.340
<v Speaker 1>Indian language as well.</v>

220
00:12:27.430 --> 00:12:28.570
<v Speaker 1>Typically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>older people,</v>

221
00:12:30.130 --> 00:12:32.400
<v Speaker 1>many black South Africans speak three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>four,</v>

222
00:12:32.410 --> 00:12:33.970
<v Speaker 1>five,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or even more languages.</v>

223
00:12:34.180 --> 00:12:36.670
<v Speaker 1>It's common for them to speak their </v>
<v Speaker 1>native African language,</v>

224
00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:40.240
<v Speaker 1>English and Afrikaans and one or more </v>
<v Speaker 1>other African languages.</v>

225
00:12:40.540 --> 00:12:42.550
<v Speaker 1>They're often able to speak the other </v>
<v Speaker 1>languages,</v>

226
00:12:42.551 --> 00:12:46.210
<v Speaker 1>have the same sub group as their native </v>
<v Speaker 1>language because they're closely related</v>

227
00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:47.073
<v Speaker 1>and in many cases mutually intelligible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You may be wondering if the languages </v>

228
00:12:50.441 --> 00:12:52.960
<v Speaker 1>within each subgroup or mutually </v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligible,</v>

229
00:12:52.990 --> 00:12:54.910
<v Speaker 1>why are they considered separate </v>
<v Speaker 1>languages?</v>

230
00:12:55.090 --> 00:12:55.923
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what does a language versus what is a </v>

231
00:12:57.131 --> 00:12:57.964
<v Speaker 1>dialect is a murky issue as always,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think it's partly because they </v>

232
00:13:01.331 --> 00:13:02.164
<v Speaker 1>each have their own standardized variety</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's partly because each one is </v>

233
00:13:05.501 --> 00:13:09.520
<v Speaker 1>associated with a distinct ethnic group.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These days,</v>

234
00:13:09.550 --> 00:13:10.383
<v Speaker 1>business and politics are emotionally </v>
<v Speaker 1>conducted in English and English as the </v>

235
00:13:13.151 --> 00:13:16.420
<v Speaker 1>most common language of broadcast and </v>
<v Speaker 1>media for a long time.</v>

236
00:13:16.510 --> 00:13:19.630
<v Speaker 1>English and Afrikaans had equal status </v>
<v Speaker 1>as dual lingua.</v>

237
00:13:19.630 --> 00:13:23.140
<v Speaker 1>Franca is of South Africa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but Afrikaans has been declining in that</v>

238
00:13:23.141 --> 00:13:25.930
<v Speaker 1>regard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's partly due to the stigma attached</v>

239
00:13:25.931 --> 00:13:28.840
<v Speaker 1>to off recons as it's seen as the </v>
<v Speaker 1>language of apartheid.</v>

240
00:13:29.230 --> 00:13:30.063
<v Speaker 1>In addition to that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>education in South Africa tends to lean </v>

241
00:13:32.081 --> 00:13:35.050
<v Speaker 1>toward English.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In typical South African schools,</v>

242
00:13:35.080 --> 00:13:37.780
<v Speaker 1>the first three grades are taught in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>student's mother tongue,</v>

243
00:13:38.170 --> 00:13:41.950
<v Speaker 1>but after that school work is conducted </v>
<v Speaker 1>in either Afrikaans or English.</v>

244
00:13:42.850 --> 00:13:44.950
<v Speaker 1>Schools can teach in the native language</v>
<v Speaker 1>longer,</v>

245
00:13:44.980 --> 00:13:45.813
<v Speaker 1>but since secondary school matriculation</v>
<v Speaker 1>exams are only conducted in English and </v>

246
00:13:49.001 --> 00:13:52.030
<v Speaker 1>Afrikaans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a strong motivation to switch to</v>

247
00:13:52.031 --> 00:13:52.864
<v Speaker 1>one of those languages early on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but rather than Afrikaans most choose </v>

248
00:13:56.621 --> 00:13:57.454
<v Speaker 1>English due to its utility and prestige </v>
<v Speaker 1>and in many cases families will forego </v>

249
00:14:01.541 --> 00:14:05.050
<v Speaker 1>students being taught in their first </v>
<v Speaker 1>language and go straight into English to</v>

250
00:14:05.051 --> 00:14:05.884
<v Speaker 1>jumpstart their proficiency,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but whether this is a help or a </v>

251
00:14:08.651 --> 00:14:10.630
<v Speaker 1>hindrance is a source of much debate.</v>

252
00:14:11.380 --> 00:14:12.213
<v Speaker 1>The emphasis on English and Afrikaans </v>
<v Speaker 1>after the first three or four years of </v>

253
00:14:15.011 --> 00:14:18.430
<v Speaker 1>initial schooling is a lasting influence</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the colonial era.</v>

254
00:14:18.700 --> 00:14:22.900
<v Speaker 1>Today there are 11 official languages </v>
<v Speaker 1>and in theory and in law they are equal,</v>

255
00:14:22.930 --> 00:14:25.810
<v Speaker 1>but in practice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>English and Afrikaans are still the most</v>

256
00:14:25.811 --> 00:14:28.090
<v Speaker 1>influential languages at the national </v>
<v Speaker 1>level,</v>

257
00:14:28.330 --> 00:14:29.163
<v Speaker 1>and this is still the case for now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>despite the fact that Africans has lost </v>

258
00:14:31.901 --> 00:14:32.734
<v Speaker 1>some of its prestige.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The question of the date for South </v>

259
00:14:35.680 --> 00:14:37.930
<v Speaker 1>Africans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which languages do you speak and in what</v>

260
00:14:37.931 --> 00:14:40.900
<v Speaker 1>situations do you use them and for other</v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

261
00:14:41.050 --> 00:14:43.300
<v Speaker 1>how many official languages are there in</v>
<v Speaker 1>your country?</v>

262
00:14:43.900 --> 00:14:46.090
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that system works well for </v>
<v Speaker 1>your country?</v>

263
00:14:46.450 --> 00:14:48.610
<v Speaker 1>Be sure to follow lane,</v>
<v Speaker 1>focus on facebook,</v>

264
00:14:48.640 --> 00:14:49.960
<v Speaker 1>twitter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Instagram,</v>

265
00:14:50.020 --> 00:14:52.730
<v Speaker 1>and once again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thank you to all of my wonderful patrion</v>

266
00:14:52.731 --> 00:14:53.564

267
00:14:55.251 --> 00:14:56.084

<v Speaker 1>Many thanks to them as always and to </v>

268
00:14:59.841 --> 00:15:00.674
<v Speaker 1>everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank you for watching and have a nice </v>

269
00:15:02.631 --> 00:15:03.464
<v Speaker 1>day.</v>
