00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:02.850
<v Speaker 1>Good day everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Welcome to the Lange focus channel.</v>

2
00:00:02.851 --> 00:00:03.684
<v Speaker 1>My name is Paul.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Today I'm going to be talking about </v>

3
00:00:05.821 --> 00:00:08.160
<v Speaker 1>something that has been all the rage </v>
<v Speaker 1>recently,</v>

4
00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:09.053
<v Speaker 1>something called duo lingo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now this is a totally free language </v>

5
00:00:12.691 --> 00:00:16.560
<v Speaker 1>learning platform.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has a online desktop version and also</v>

6
00:00:16.561 --> 00:00:17.394
<v Speaker 1>a smart phone version.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's something that I haven't gotten </v>

7
00:00:19.081 --> 00:00:19.914
<v Speaker 1>around to trying until just recently </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I've been so busy with other </v>

8
00:00:22.441 --> 00:00:24.150
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but everyone's talking about it.</v>

9
00:00:24.151 --> 00:00:25.290
<v Speaker 1>People keep asking me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

10
00:00:25.291 --> 00:00:26.124
<v Speaker 1>have you tried to do a lingo?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I had to get on it and see what I </v>

11
00:00:28.561 --> 00:00:29.394
<v Speaker 1>thought of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I started duolingo lingo just a few </v>

12
00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.420
<v Speaker 1>days ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I started with Esperanto.</v>

13
00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.130
<v Speaker 1>Why did they choose Esperanto?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

14
00:00:35.131 --> 00:00:39.060
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to start with a language I've </v>
<v Speaker 1>never studied before just so I could try</v>

15
00:00:39.061 --> 00:00:42.900
<v Speaker 1>out the platform and focus on that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll test out Esperanto and duo lingo at</v>

16
00:00:42.901 --> 00:00:44.250
<v Speaker 1>the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was my thinking.</v>

17
00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:49.490
<v Speaker 1>So my basic impressions of duo lingo is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that it's a great free resource that you</v>

18
00:00:49.681 --> 00:00:51.840
<v Speaker 1>can use a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's excellent,</v>

19
00:00:51.841 --> 00:00:52.920
<v Speaker 1>it's motivating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's fun,</v>

20
00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:53.843
<v Speaker 1>but it's not the only thing that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>should use for reasons that I will get </v>

21
00:00:56.521 --> 00:00:57.630
<v Speaker 1>into in a minute.</v>

22
00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.020
<v Speaker 1>So let's just have a look and see how it</v>
<v Speaker 1>works.</v>

23
00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:04.883
<v Speaker 1>You can see right here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is my profile page that's me over </v>

24
00:01:07.681 --> 00:01:08.850
<v Speaker 1>here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Paul Jorgensen.</v>

25
00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:14.040
<v Speaker 1>And you can see over here on my language</v>
<v Speaker 1>is Esperanto level six.</v>

26
00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:14.903
<v Speaker 1>Let's look back at this page over here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The basic theme of duo lingo is </v>

27
00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:22.380
<v Speaker 1>gamification.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They want language learning to be like a</v>

28
00:01:22.381 --> 00:01:24.390
<v Speaker 1>game,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something that can motivate you and keep</v>

29
00:01:24.391 --> 00:01:27.210
<v Speaker 1>you studying every day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because one of the biggest problems with</v>

30
00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.420
<v Speaker 1>language learning is that people give up</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there are not consistent.</v>

31
00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.330
<v Speaker 1>I have a video about consistency.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very important.</v>

32
00:01:33.331 --> 00:01:34.164
<v Speaker 1>Consistency is king had.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You really need to study every day if </v>

33
00:01:37.381 --> 00:01:40.140
<v Speaker 1>you want your skills to keep </v>
<v Speaker 1>progressively improving.</v>

34
00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:41.043
<v Speaker 1>So they're trying to solve that problem </v>
<v Speaker 1>of lack of consistency by making it a </v>

35
00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:45.253
<v Speaker 1>game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you look over on the left down </v>

36
00:01:46.951 --> 00:01:49.500
<v Speaker 1>here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have an Esperanto skill tree.</v>

37
00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.850
<v Speaker 1>They have that for every language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course it starts off with basics.</v>

38
00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:55.740
<v Speaker 1>So you go in here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is one skill.</v>

39
00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:56.933
<v Speaker 1>Then you have a few lessons for each </v>
<v Speaker 1>skill and then you move on to the next </v>

40
00:02:00.511 --> 00:02:01.291
<v Speaker 1>one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the next one,</v>

41
00:02:01.291 --> 00:02:03.930
<v Speaker 1>and as you move down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're achieving targets.</v>

42
00:02:03.931 --> 00:02:06.450
<v Speaker 1>You're getting something called </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience points.</v>

43
00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:07.523
<v Speaker 1>So over here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like my goal is set at 20 experience </v>

44
00:02:09.871 --> 00:02:11.160
<v Speaker 1>points per day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I get that,</v>

45
00:02:11.161 --> 00:02:13.560
<v Speaker 1>then I've met my goal today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went on a rampage,</v>

46
00:02:13.561 --> 00:02:14.394
<v Speaker 1>I've got 380 because I wanted to just </v>
<v Speaker 1>get a lot under my belt before talking </v>

47
00:02:18.181 --> 00:02:21.330
<v Speaker 1>about Duolingo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you meet your target,</v>

48
00:02:21.331 --> 00:02:22.860
<v Speaker 1>it's just like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

49
00:02:22.861 --> 00:02:24.240
<v Speaker 1>you're patting yourself on the back </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

50
00:02:24.241 --> 00:02:25.074
<v Speaker 1>Yay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got,</v>

51
00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:29.460
<v Speaker 1>I met my goal for my experience points </v>
<v Speaker 1>for today and you get something called a</v>

52
00:02:29.461 --> 00:02:31.980
<v Speaker 1>streak.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm on a two day streak yesterday.</v>

53
00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:35.280
<v Speaker 1>I surpassed my 20 experience points </v>
<v Speaker 1>today,</v>

54
00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:38.940
<v Speaker 1>surpass by a long shot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you keep up that streak,</v>

55
00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:41.700
<v Speaker 1>then you start to get some other rewards</v>
<v Speaker 1>as well.</v>

56
00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:44.550
<v Speaker 1>The experience points that you get when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you are on a streak.</v>

57
00:02:44.551 --> 00:02:45.384
<v Speaker 1>But also when you finish some of these </v>
<v Speaker 1>skills and when you do some translation </v>

58
00:02:48.181 --> 00:02:51.060
<v Speaker 1>services or when you do some kind of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>time to practice,</v>

59
00:02:51.061 --> 00:02:53.850
<v Speaker 1>you get these experience points and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're basically just a way,</v>

60
00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:58.200
<v Speaker 1>a symbolic way to motivate you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there are these other reports called</v>

61
00:02:58.260 --> 00:02:59.093
<v Speaker 1>lean gods I've been got from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it gets whatever you call them and you </v>

62
00:03:01.331 --> 00:03:04.000
<v Speaker 1>get these when you finish a new skill </v>
<v Speaker 1>for the first time.</v>

63
00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:07.180
<v Speaker 1>And also when you've leveled up to a new</v>
<v Speaker 1>level,</v>

64
00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:09.790
<v Speaker 1>then you get a certain number of </v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible].</v>

65
00:03:09.791 --> 00:03:12.010
<v Speaker 1>So if you level up to level four for </v>
<v Speaker 1>example,</v>

66
00:03:12.011 --> 00:03:13.870
<v Speaker 1>you'll get four ling got sore.</v>

67
00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:16.760
<v Speaker 1>If you pass level 10 then you'll get 10 </v>
<v Speaker 1>lingo.</v>

68
00:03:16.761 --> 00:03:18.950
<v Speaker 1>It's like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then when you finish a new skill and</v>

69
00:03:18.951 --> 00:03:21.030
<v Speaker 1>you get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I forget how many exactly,</v>

70
00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:23.110
<v Speaker 1>you get to mingle or something and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>build up.</v>

71
00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:27.190
<v Speaker 1>So when you get enough of this lingo I </v>
<v Speaker 1>these little jewel things,</v>

72
00:03:27.191 --> 00:03:28.024
<v Speaker 1>then you can go to the link.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Got Store and you can buy some neat </v>

73
00:03:30.461 --> 00:03:31.294
<v Speaker 1>stuff with them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now these are mostly just for the </v>

74
00:03:33.671 --> 00:03:35.740
<v Speaker 1>purpose of gamification and nothing </v>
<v Speaker 1>useful.</v>

75
00:03:35.741 --> 00:03:38.230
<v Speaker 1>You can't order like the tee shirt or </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever as far as I know,</v>

76
00:03:38.231 --> 00:03:40.840
<v Speaker 1>but you can do stuff like this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a strict freeze.</v>

77
00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:44.200
<v Speaker 1>So if you need to take a day off and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't want to end your streak,</v>

78
00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:47.230
<v Speaker 1>then you can buy a streak freeze for </v>
<v Speaker 1>four 10 link dots.</v>

79
00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:50.470
<v Speaker 1>Or here's a little gambling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a fun activity,</v>

80
00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:51.333
<v Speaker 1>double or nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can bet five lane guts and maybe </v>

81
00:03:53.621 --> 00:03:54.454
<v Speaker 1>you'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll get 10 link God's back if you </v>

82
00:03:56.111 --> 00:03:57.490
<v Speaker 1>maintain a seven day streak.</v>

83
00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:01.320
<v Speaker 1>So it's just basically wagering on your </v>
<v Speaker 1>own ability to maintain your streets.</v>

84
00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:05.380
<v Speaker 1>So it's just kind of a fun way to make </v>
<v Speaker 1>use of this lingo lights.</v>

85
00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:07.153
<v Speaker 1>Another couple of things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can take a time to practice so you </v>

86
00:04:09.671 --> 00:04:12.250
<v Speaker 1>can see how well you're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That costs 10 lingo.</v>

87
00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:15.130
<v Speaker 1>You can take a quiz,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a progress quiz,</v>

88
00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:16.053
<v Speaker 1>and that costs 25 lingo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So all these things that you can buy </v>

89
00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:19.743
<v Speaker 1>with those lingo that you earned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There were also a couple of additional </v>

90
00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:23.163
<v Speaker 1>items available on the smartphone only </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you can buy some special clothing </v>

91
00:04:26.411 --> 00:04:27.244
<v Speaker 1>for the duo mascot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a mascot and duos an hour and you can </v>

92
00:04:30.881 --> 00:04:31.714
<v Speaker 1>buy some clothing for him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when he appears on your screen to </v>

93
00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:38.740
<v Speaker 1>congratulate you on a job well done,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he'll appear in his new updated closing.</v>

94
00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:41.180
<v Speaker 1>That's another reward you can buy with </v>
<v Speaker 1>your lingo.</v>

95
00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:43.720
<v Speaker 1>So again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just a fun thing to motivate you.</v>

96
00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:48.400
<v Speaker 1>Having things like experience points and</v>
<v Speaker 1>rewards for your successes,</v>

97
00:04:48.401 --> 00:04:49.234
<v Speaker 1>that's something that will appeal to a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of people who are into role playing </v>

98
00:04:51.821 --> 00:04:53.560
<v Speaker 1>games or video games,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that kind of thing.</v>

99
00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:57.340
<v Speaker 1>And it's really expanding language,</v>
<v Speaker 1>learning into off all new audience.</v>

100
00:04:57.341 --> 00:04:58.174
<v Speaker 1>And I think that that's really great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Another element of duo lingo that helps </v>

101
00:05:01.271 --> 00:05:02.104
<v Speaker 1>motivate you in a game like way is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can connect with your friends and </v>

102
00:05:04.751 --> 00:05:05.584
<v Speaker 1>you can follow each other's progress.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you can see how much they've done </v>

103
00:05:08.291 --> 00:05:09.124
<v Speaker 1>today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how many experience points they've </v>

104
00:05:09.851 --> 00:05:11.980
<v Speaker 1>gotten today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you've got more than you can call</v>

105
00:05:11.981 --> 00:05:12.814
<v Speaker 1>them out on that and you can challenge </v>
<v Speaker 1>them or you can make bets with each </v>

106
00:05:14.861 --> 00:05:15.790
<v Speaker 1>other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that kind of thing.</v>

107
00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:19.090
<v Speaker 1>So it's really good just to keep each </v>
<v Speaker 1>other accountable.</v>

108
00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:20.133
<v Speaker 1>Some people don't need that personally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't really need that kind of </v>

109
00:05:22.391 --> 00:05:24.220
<v Speaker 1>accountability,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but some people really do.</v>

110
00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:25.720
<v Speaker 1>And for them it's great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

111
00:05:25.721 --> 00:05:28.930
<v Speaker 1>So getting into the actual language </v>
<v Speaker 1>taught and the learning method,</v>

112
00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:31.810
<v Speaker 1>I really liked the order of the language</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they introduced.</v>

113
00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:32.703
<v Speaker 1>It's a very logical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it starts from the beginning and </v>

114
00:05:34.871 --> 00:05:35.704
<v Speaker 1>progress into the more advanced material</v>
<v Speaker 1>starts with very basic sentence </v>

115
00:05:39.041 --> 00:05:42.400
<v Speaker 1>structures,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a basic vocabulary,</v>

116
00:05:42.401 --> 00:05:44.530
<v Speaker 1>like uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the translation for men.</v>

117
00:05:44.531 --> 00:05:45.364
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Veto,</v>

118
00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:48.250
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's correct.</v>

119
00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:49.520
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know what's correct.</v>

120
00:05:49.521 --> 00:05:54.040
<v Speaker 1>So continue me and the STSV.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am not you.</v>

121
00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:56.920
<v Speaker 1>That's what that means.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am not used to put that in.</v>

122
00:05:56.930 --> 00:05:59.750
<v Speaker 1>Check it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Get lost a CC cleaner.</v>

123
00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:01.420
<v Speaker 1>Don't need you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

124
00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:02.810
<v Speaker 1>So that's correct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's continue.</v>

125
00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:05.310
<v Speaker 1>LACMA,</v>
<v Speaker 1>marbles,</v>

126
00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:06.163
<v Speaker 1>and that means the boy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's just basic vocabulary and it's </v>

127
00:06:10.111 --> 00:06:11.730
<v Speaker 1>just basic sentence structures.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

128
00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:13.530
<v Speaker 1>I am you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am not you.</v>

129
00:06:13.531 --> 00:06:14.364
<v Speaker 1>I am a boy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am a man starts with very simple </v>

130
00:06:16.081 --> 00:06:18.630
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just a equals b sentences.</v>

131
00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:19.321
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

132
00:06:19.321 --> 00:06:20.550
<v Speaker 1>go back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

133
00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:21.743
<v Speaker 1>and then it progressively gets more of </v>
<v Speaker 1>advanced start building up some more </v>

134
00:06:25.291 --> 00:06:28.860
<v Speaker 1>basic grammar and some basic vocabulary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The accusative,</v>

135
00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:32.540
<v Speaker 1>plurals possessive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

136
00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:34.620
<v Speaker 1>animal vocabulary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>country vocabulary.</v>

137
00:06:34.621 --> 00:06:36.990
<v Speaker 1>So it's very basic stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But as you get down here,</v>

138
00:06:36.991 --> 00:06:38.700
<v Speaker 1>then you get more into the advanced </v>
<v Speaker 1>grammar,</v>

139
00:06:38.850 --> 00:06:39.810
<v Speaker 1>more events,</v>
<v Speaker 1>topics,</v>

140
00:06:39.811 --> 00:06:40.890
<v Speaker 1>health,</v>
<v Speaker 1>travel,</v>

141
00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:42.900
<v Speaker 1>education.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it,</v>

142
00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:45.570
<v Speaker 1>it looks quite good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I haven't gotten through all of it yet,</v>

143
00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:48.090
<v Speaker 1>but I'm a third of the way through or </v>
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>

144
00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:51.960
<v Speaker 1>And I think the order that they teach </v>
<v Speaker 1>the language and it's quite good,</v>

145
00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:54.060
<v Speaker 1>the selection of vocabulary is quite </v>
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>

146
00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:56.490
<v Speaker 1>And the sentence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it gets you to produce our,</v>

147
00:06:56.730 --> 00:06:58.360
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not totally natural there.</v>

148
00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.370
<v Speaker 1>They're basic and they are the sentences</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should be learning at this level.</v>

149
00:07:02.371 --> 00:07:03.204
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's go into another skill that I </v>

150
00:07:05.611 --> 00:07:07.680
<v Speaker 1>was doing more recently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll just kind of,</v>

151
00:07:07.850 --> 00:07:10.200
<v Speaker 1>I'll redo it and walk through it with </v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

152
00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:14.910
<v Speaker 1>So this one Bonai Pat Toi have us long </v>
<v Speaker 1>Gyne Tago in.</v>

153
00:07:14.911 --> 00:07:18.150
<v Speaker 1>So that means I know what it means.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Literally.</v>

154
00:07:18.151 --> 00:07:18.984
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what they're trying to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I mean it's good fathers have long </v>

155
00:07:22.590 --> 00:07:23.670
<v Speaker 1>days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What the heck does that mean?</v>

156
00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:26.250
<v Speaker 1>I'm not quite sure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's what it says.</v>

157
00:07:26.850 --> 00:07:30.660
<v Speaker 1>So when you are looking at a sentence </v>
<v Speaker 1>like this,</v>

158
00:07:31.110 --> 00:07:35.220
<v Speaker 1>sometimes you have to translate it and </v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes from Esperanto into English,</v>

159
00:07:35.250 --> 00:07:36.083
<v Speaker 1>sometimes English into Esperanto.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes it just asks you to translate </v>

160
00:07:39.181 --> 00:07:42.930
<v Speaker 1>a word or um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just look for vocabulary matching,</v>

161
00:07:43.350 --> 00:07:45.990
<v Speaker 1>that kind of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But under each,</v>

162
00:07:46.170 --> 00:07:47.003
<v Speaker 1>each point there's a link here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can discuss the sentence with your </v>

163
00:07:49.981 --> 00:07:50.814
<v Speaker 1>peers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can look down here and discuss and </v>

164
00:07:53.101 --> 00:07:55.080
<v Speaker 1>ask questions about the sentence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like this one,</v>

165
00:07:55.380 --> 00:07:57.030
<v Speaker 1>people are saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what does this mean though?</v>

166
00:07:57.031 --> 00:07:59.550
<v Speaker 1>Cause they don't know what the message </v>
<v Speaker 1>of that sentence is.</v>

167
00:07:59.620 --> 00:08:00.453
<v Speaker 1>What the community interactions kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>neat gives you a chance to discuss </v>

168
00:08:03.421 --> 00:08:05.940
<v Speaker 1>things and get further clarification if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you need it.</v>

169
00:08:06.150 --> 00:08:07.890
<v Speaker 1>Vito Estos Bella.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

170
00:08:08.670 --> 00:08:10.470
<v Speaker 1>So that means,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh man is handsome.</v>

171
00:08:11.970 --> 00:08:14.160
<v Speaker 1>So that's another very basic sentence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course</v>

172
00:08:17.540 --> 00:08:19.200
<v Speaker 1>oil,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the plural form,</v>

173
00:08:19.201 --> 00:08:21.030
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Veto a with the J at the end.</v>

174
00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:24.000
<v Speaker 1>If your toy men are handsome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it gives you the correction down here</v>

175
00:08:24.180 --> 00:08:25.013
<v Speaker 1>at one thing I don't like is that it </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't give you a chance to enter the </v>

176
00:08:27.571 --> 00:08:29.520
<v Speaker 1>correct sentence if you get something </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrong.</v>

177
00:08:29.550 --> 00:08:30.790
<v Speaker 1>There's actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

178
00:08:30.810 --> 00:08:31.643
<v Speaker 1>psychological reasons behind this that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you should have a chance to correct the </v>

179
00:08:34.711 --> 00:08:37.170
<v Speaker 1>mistake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for me as a teacher,</v>

180
00:08:37.171 --> 00:08:39.690
<v Speaker 1>when I'm teaching my students,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they make a mistake,</v>

181
00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:42.870
<v Speaker 1>I always have to give them a chance to </v>
<v Speaker 1>correct themselves.</v>

182
00:08:42.871 --> 00:08:46.260
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to leave them hanging.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It leaves a kind of open loop where they</v>

183
00:08:46.261 --> 00:08:49.530
<v Speaker 1>feel like they've failed and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>haven't actually fixed the problem.</v>

184
00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:50.393
<v Speaker 1>So it just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it creates a kind of lingering </v>

185
00:08:51.630 --> 00:08:53.310
<v Speaker 1>dissatisfaction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't like that.</v>

186
00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:54.393
<v Speaker 1>I would prefer if they change so that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you could enter the correct sentence </v>

187
00:08:57.511 --> 00:08:59.640
<v Speaker 1>right here after you have gotten it </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrong.</v>

188
00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:00.513
<v Speaker 1>That's just a psychological thing and </v>
<v Speaker 1>educational concept that I think is </v>

189
00:09:03.271 --> 00:09:05.640
<v Speaker 1>important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hope they can fix that in the future.</v>

190
00:09:05.790 --> 00:09:07.680
<v Speaker 1>But anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>moving on,</v>

191
00:09:08.250 --> 00:09:10.260
<v Speaker 1>Julep has sona,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's dust.</v>

192
00:09:10.261 --> 00:09:14.190
<v Speaker 1>Malibu owner is the person in bed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what it means.</v>

193
00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:19.400
<v Speaker 1>Is the person bad check it being yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you can see as you get them correct.</v>

194
00:09:22.950 --> 00:09:26.190
<v Speaker 1>Then this progress bar starts moving </v>
<v Speaker 1>towards your goal at the end here.</v>

195
00:09:26.460 --> 00:09:27.293
<v Speaker 1>And when you reach this area,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then that means you're finished the </v>

196
00:09:29.191 --> 00:09:31.890
<v Speaker 1>skill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the exercises are slightly different</v>

197
00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:35.040
<v Speaker 1>on the smartphone application.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not always entering them in a box.</v>

198
00:09:35.041 --> 00:09:35.874
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes they have a bunch of tabs with</v>
<v Speaker 1>words on them and you can arrange those </v>

199
00:09:40.801 --> 00:09:42.510
<v Speaker 1>words.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're practicing the syntax.</v>

200
00:09:42.660 --> 00:09:46.860
<v Speaker 1>Some of the smartphone exercises are a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little better than the online version.</v>

201
00:09:48.610 --> 00:09:50.370
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but both of them are good.</v>

202
00:09:50.371 --> 00:09:52.440
<v Speaker 1>You can do both.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

203
00:09:52.650 --> 00:09:56.310
<v Speaker 1>one thing that you might notice is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's all just sentence translation.</v>

204
00:09:56.490 --> 00:09:57.323
<v Speaker 1>You're given a sentence and you have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>translate it or you're given a phrase </v>

205
00:10:00.301 --> 00:10:01.134
<v Speaker 1>and you have to translate it or you have</v>
<v Speaker 1>to just complete a sentence with a word </v>

206
00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:06.840
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That duo lingo is great for learning the</v>

207
00:10:06.841 --> 00:10:07.674
<v Speaker 1>basic sentence structure of a language </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the basic vocabulary of a language </v>

208
00:10:11.071 --> 00:10:11.904
<v Speaker 1>basically for making sentences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's similar to something like the </v>

209
00:10:14.641 --> 00:10:17.700
<v Speaker 1>Michelle Thomas Method,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I think is useful,</v>

210
00:10:17.701 --> 00:10:18.534
<v Speaker 1>but it's kind of limited because you </v>
<v Speaker 1>just learn how to translate into your </v>

211
00:10:21.361 --> 00:10:22.194
<v Speaker 1>target language basically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's not really giving you the </v>

212
00:10:25.081 --> 00:10:25.914
<v Speaker 1>interactive skills,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not teaching you the discourse </v>

213
00:10:27.661 --> 00:10:30.870
<v Speaker 1>skills that you need to be able to </v>
<v Speaker 1>communicate in a real context,</v>

214
00:10:30.871 --> 00:10:31.704
<v Speaker 1>so that's its main weakness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it is good for teaching you how to </v>

215
00:10:34.471 --> 00:10:36.000
<v Speaker 1>make sentences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

216
00:10:36.001 --> 00:10:36.834
<v Speaker 1>another weakness that I think is </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually quite critical as that duo </v>

217
00:10:39.571 --> 00:10:42.870
<v Speaker 1>lingo can't really effectively be used </v>
<v Speaker 1>offline.</v>

218
00:10:43.110 --> 00:10:43.943
<v Speaker 1>I was in Philippines just this week and </v>
<v Speaker 1>in Philippines they don't have reliable </v>

219
00:10:47.521 --> 00:10:48.354
<v Speaker 1>internet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>With your data connection with your </v>

220
00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:53.370
<v Speaker 1>smartphone or on even on your laptop at </v>
<v Speaker 1>home,</v>

221
00:10:53.610 --> 00:10:56.010
<v Speaker 1>often there's an inconsistent wifi </v>
<v Speaker 1>connection,</v>

222
00:10:56.040 --> 00:11:01.040
<v Speaker 1>so it made it really hard and almost </v>
<v Speaker 1>almost pointless to use duo lingo when I</v>

223
00:11:01.141 --> 00:11:04.090
<v Speaker 1>was out on the go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially with my data on my smartphone</v>

224
00:11:04.170 --> 00:11:07.410
<v Speaker 1>because you just walk 10 steps and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're out of range or you,</v>

225
00:11:07.590 --> 00:11:09.090
<v Speaker 1>you turn a corner and you're out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>range,</v>

226
00:11:09.091 --> 00:11:10.920
<v Speaker 1>you sit in a coffee shop and you're out </v>
<v Speaker 1>of range.</v>

227
00:11:10.921 --> 00:11:15.330
<v Speaker 1>So I would have to sit there and wait to</v>
<v Speaker 1>know if my answer was correct or I would</v>

228
00:11:15.331 --> 00:11:16.164
<v Speaker 1>know it was correct,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I would have to wait for the next </v>

229
00:11:18.061 --> 00:11:18.894
<v Speaker 1>question to load until I got into range </v>
<v Speaker 1>and just made it basically too much </v>

230
00:11:21.931 --> 00:11:25.620
<v Speaker 1>trouble to even bother.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I really didn't bother with duo lingo</v>

231
00:11:25.621 --> 00:11:27.510
<v Speaker 1>when I was in Philippines this week.</v>

232
00:11:27.630 --> 00:11:30.090
<v Speaker 1>So that's just one thing that I think </v>
<v Speaker 1>they have to tackle,</v>

233
00:11:30.091 --> 00:11:33.510
<v Speaker 1>especially if they want dual lingo to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>a truly global service.</v>

234
00:11:33.511 --> 00:11:36.390
<v Speaker 1>They're going to have to make it so that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can do it offline.</v>

235
00:11:36.420 --> 00:11:37.253
<v Speaker 1>Like you can download some of the levels</v>
<v Speaker 1>or you can download a certain number of </v>

236
00:11:39.751 --> 00:11:41.250
<v Speaker 1>skills,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do them offline,</v>

237
00:11:41.460 --> 00:11:45.870
<v Speaker 1>and then you can upload your progress </v>
<v Speaker 1>once you get in range of Wifi or data.</v>

238
00:11:45.900 --> 00:11:48.090
<v Speaker 1>I think that's really important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They really need to do that.</v>

239
00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:50.370
<v Speaker 1>I know that some other applications do </v>
<v Speaker 1>do that,</v>

240
00:11:50.371 --> 00:11:51.204
<v Speaker 1>so I hope duo lingo gets on top of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That will be really useful for people </v>

241
00:11:54.161 --> 00:11:54.994
<v Speaker 1>like me who travel and really useful for</v>
<v Speaker 1>people who are in developing countries </v>

242
00:11:58.271 --> 00:12:00.640
<v Speaker 1>or places where there's inconsistent </v>
<v Speaker 1>connection.</v>

243
00:12:01.380 --> 00:12:02.213
<v Speaker 1>But in conclusion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think duolingo was an excellent free </v>

244
00:12:04.301 --> 00:12:06.100
<v Speaker 1>resource,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially because it's free.</v>

245
00:12:06.101 --> 00:12:06.934
<v Speaker 1>I just think that that's really cool </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you can get the service for free </v>

246
00:12:09.221 --> 00:12:10.054
<v Speaker 1>and then maybe an exchange volunteer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a translation services just as a </v>

247
00:12:13.750 --> 00:12:14.860
<v Speaker 1>gift back to them.</v>

248
00:12:15.070 --> 00:12:16.780
<v Speaker 1>I think that that's a really cool way to</v>
<v Speaker 1>do it.</v>

249
00:12:16.820 --> 00:12:20.710
<v Speaker 1>Using crowdsourcing in exchange for some</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of free service.</v>

250
00:12:20.711 --> 00:12:21.544
<v Speaker 1>I think that's awesome and it just shows</v>
<v Speaker 1>where we are in 2015 it's an awesome </v>

251
00:12:25.180 --> 00:12:26.013
<v Speaker 1>online economy as far as I'm concerned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think if duo lingo balances the </v>

252
00:12:29.891 --> 00:12:30.724
<v Speaker 1>skills taught a little better,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it gives you more opportunity to do </v>

253
00:12:33.731 --> 00:12:34.564
<v Speaker 1>some kind of simulated interaction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like some question and answer exercises </v>

254
00:12:37.481 --> 00:12:38.314
<v Speaker 1>and that kind of thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it gives you a little more listening </v>

255
00:12:39.551 --> 00:12:42.070
<v Speaker 1>practice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then it will become even more useful.</v>

256
00:12:42.130 --> 00:12:45.670
<v Speaker 1>So I hope they keep expanding the </v>
<v Speaker 1>features include some things like that,</v>

257
00:12:46.090 --> 00:12:47.680
<v Speaker 1>but even as it stands,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's great.</v>

258
00:12:47.681 --> 00:12:50.020
<v Speaker 1>It's a fun way to just practice on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>go.</v>

259
00:12:50.021 --> 00:12:52.300
<v Speaker 1>It's a fun way to dabble in a new </v>
<v Speaker 1>language a little bit.</v>

260
00:12:52.301 --> 00:12:54.370
<v Speaker 1>If you want to see what it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's free.</v>

261
00:12:54.550 --> 00:12:55.510
<v Speaker 1>It's easy to start.</v>

262
00:12:55.510 --> 00:12:57.700
<v Speaker 1>It's fun because of the game of vacation</v>
<v Speaker 1>features.</v>

263
00:12:57.701 --> 00:12:58.534
<v Speaker 1>So I think Duolingo is on the right </v>
<v Speaker 1>track and they're creating something </v>

264
00:13:01.871 --> 00:13:03.520
<v Speaker 1>pretty awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I hope you try it out.</v>

265
00:13:03.730 --> 00:13:06.190
<v Speaker 1>Thank you for tuning into length focus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is Paul.</v>

266
00:13:06.191 --> 00:13:09.310
<v Speaker 1>Have a good nights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See Ya all over the world.</v>

267
00:13:09.311 --> 00:13:12.790
<v Speaker 1>There are people who speak closely </v>
<v Speaker 1>related forms of communication.</v>

268
00:13:13.060 --> 00:13:15.640
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes they are called different </v>
<v Speaker 1>languages.</v>

269
00:13:15.641 --> 00:13:17.920
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes they are called dialects of </v>
<v Speaker 1>one language.</v>

270
00:13:17.921 --> 00:13:18.754
<v Speaker 1>So how do we decide which one they are?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes there's some disagreement </v>

271
00:13:21.641 --> 00:13:24.480
<v Speaker 1>about which one a particular form of </v>
<v Speaker 1>communication is.</v>

272
00:13:24.481 --> 00:13:26.620
<v Speaker 1>Is it a dialect or is it a separate </v>
<v Speaker 1>language?</v>

273
00:13:26.950 --> 00:13:27.783
<v Speaker 1>Putting them off into the future after </v>
<v Speaker 1>you finish achieving this current goal </v>

274
00:13:31.151 --> 00:13:32.380
<v Speaker 1>right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

275
00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:34.900
<v Speaker 1>getting really good at French in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>future.</v>

276
00:13:34.901 --> 00:13:35.734
<v Speaker 1>Beyond that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can see the next goal in front of </v>

277
00:13:37.511 --> 00:13:38.344
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is to start learning Spanish or </v>

278
00:13:39.491 --> 00:13:41.810
<v Speaker 1>whatever your language of interest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
