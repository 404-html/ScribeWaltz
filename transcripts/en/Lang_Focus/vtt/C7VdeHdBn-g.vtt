00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:09.453
<v Speaker 1>Hello everyone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>welcome to the Lange Focus Channel and </v>

2
00:00:11.111 --> 00:00:14.380
<v Speaker 1>my name is Bob.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Today I'm going to talk about the multis</v>

3
00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:15.273
<v Speaker 1>language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maltese is a unique and interesting </v>

4
00:00:17.021 --> 00:00:20.200
<v Speaker 1>language because it is a Semitic </v>
<v Speaker 1>language with a twist.</v>

5
00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:21.153
<v Speaker 1>It is the only Semitic language that is </v>
<v Speaker 1>an official language of the European </v>

6
00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:26.890
<v Speaker 1>Union.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is spoken by around 520,000</v>

7
00:00:26.891 --> 00:00:29.650
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mostly on the island nation of Malta,</v>

8
00:00:29.651 --> 00:00:31.690
<v Speaker 1>which is an island in the Mediterranean </v>
<v Speaker 1>Sea,</v>

9
00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:36.010
<v Speaker 1>not far from Sicily and not far from </v>
<v Speaker 1>Tunisia and Libya in North Africa.</v>

10
00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:36.933
<v Speaker 1>Some people claim that Maltese is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>descendant of the ancient Phoenician </v>

11
00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:40.233
<v Speaker 1>language,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but actually there is no linguistic </v>

12
00:00:41.231 --> 00:00:45.130
<v Speaker 1>evidence for this Maltese as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>descendant of a dialect of Arabic called</v>

13
00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:46.183
<v Speaker 1>low Arabic or Sicilian Arabic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it has diverged quite a lot from </v>

14
00:00:49.451 --> 00:00:53.170
<v Speaker 1>Arabic over the last thousand years or </v>
<v Speaker 1>so and has now become its own language.</v>

15
00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:54.153
<v Speaker 1>The syntax and grammar of Maltese </v>
<v Speaker 1>remains Arabic and about a third of the </v>

16
00:00:57.071 --> 00:00:57.904
<v Speaker 1>vocabulary is still Arabic and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>includes most of the grammatical </v>

17
00:01:00.251 --> 00:01:03.580
<v Speaker 1>function words as well as a lot of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>most basic vocabulary.</v>

18
00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:06.880
<v Speaker 1>About half of the vocabulary is from </v>
<v Speaker 1>Italian or Sicilian,</v>

19
00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:10.450
<v Speaker 1>and the remaining vocabulary is mostly </v>
<v Speaker 1>from English and French.</v>

20
00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:14.440
<v Speaker 1>It's still considered a Semitic language</v>
<v Speaker 1>because of its Arabic origin and because</v>

21
00:01:14.441 --> 00:01:15.274
<v Speaker 1>of its structure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you take into account all of the </v>

22
00:01:17.021 --> 00:01:19.600
<v Speaker 1>foreign loan words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially the Romance Sloan words,</v>

23
00:01:19.601 --> 00:01:23.560
<v Speaker 1>then it's essentially a hybrid language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kind of like a Semitic romance hybrid.</v>

24
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:25.833
<v Speaker 1>So how did this interesting mix of </v>
<v Speaker 1>influences come together to create </v>

25
00:01:28.391 --> 00:01:29.410
<v Speaker 1>Maltese?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

26
00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:31.090
<v Speaker 1>it's because of its history,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>

27
00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:32.500
<v Speaker 1>the fatigue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mid caliphate,</v>

28
00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:36.130
<v Speaker 1>which covered much of North Africa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>conquered Sicily at the end of the ninth</v>

29
00:01:36.131 --> 00:01:36.964
<v Speaker 1>century and brought their grubby or </v>
<v Speaker 1>north African dialect of Arabic with </v>

30
00:01:40.241 --> 00:01:41.440
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then in 10,</v>

31
00:01:41.441 --> 00:01:42.274
<v Speaker 1>49 ce,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Arabic speaking Muslim settlers from </v>

32
00:01:44.651 --> 00:01:45.484
<v Speaker 1>Sicily arrived in Malta,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is only about 200 kilometers away </v>

33
00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:52.600
<v Speaker 1>and began to establish communities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're in the year 10 91 ce.</v>

34
00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:55.870
<v Speaker 1>The normans who were Christians from </v>
<v Speaker 1>Normandy and present a France,</v>

35
00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:58.450
<v Speaker 1>had defeated the Arabs and taken hold of</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sicily,</v>

36
00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:01.990
<v Speaker 1>and then began taking hold of multitude </v>
<v Speaker 1>under Norman rule.</v>

37
00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:02.853
<v Speaker 1>More settlers from Sicily began arriving</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Malta and bringing their language </v>

38
00:02:05.621 --> 00:02:07.900
<v Speaker 1>with them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even though the normans were Christian,</v>

39
00:02:07.901 --> 00:02:08.734
<v Speaker 1>the population of Sicily was still a </v>
<v Speaker 1>mixture of Christians and Muslims who </v>

40
00:02:11.951 --> 00:02:14.380
<v Speaker 1>spoke Arabic alongside the Sicilian </v>
<v Speaker 1>language.</v>

41
00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:18.490
<v Speaker 1>After the decline of Norman rule,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the new regime in Sicily expelled all of</v>

42
00:02:18.491 --> 00:02:21.160
<v Speaker 1>the Muslims from Sicily and from Malta </v>
<v Speaker 1>as well.</v>

43
00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:22.143
<v Speaker 1>This was a very significant event </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it essentially cut off the low </v>

44
00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:28.180
<v Speaker 1>Arabic dialect from the Muslim Arabic </v>
<v Speaker 1>speaking world,</v>

45
00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:29.133
<v Speaker 1>and it also cut it off from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>classical Arabic language and other </v>

46
00:02:31.841 --> 00:02:32.674
<v Speaker 1>Arabic speaking lands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Qur'an remains a conservative force </v>

47
00:02:34.931 --> 00:02:38.140
<v Speaker 1>that prevented the dialects from </v>
<v Speaker 1>changing too much overtime,</v>

48
00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:39.183
<v Speaker 1>but in Multa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that conservative force was no longer </v>

49
00:02:41.111 --> 00:02:41.944
<v Speaker 1>connected to the dialect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the dialect was free to drift off in </v>

50
00:02:44.261 --> 00:02:46.510
<v Speaker 1>its own direction and become a new </v>
<v Speaker 1>language.</v>

51
00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:50.920
<v Speaker 1>Seek low Arabic diet out in Sicily,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it continued to be used and evolve.</v>

52
00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:51.783
<v Speaker 1>In Malta,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Malta remained part of the Kingdom of </v>

53
00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:54.633
<v Speaker 1>Sicily for several hundred years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which brought lots of Sicilian </v>

54
00:02:56.501 --> 00:03:00.370
<v Speaker 1>vocabulary into the language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The island was controlled by a string of</v>

55
00:03:00.371 --> 00:03:03.040
<v Speaker 1>rulers who influenced the developing </v>
<v Speaker 1>multis language.</v>

56
00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:03.933
<v Speaker 1>One of the most significant regimes to </v>
<v Speaker 1>rule Malta was the knights hospitaller </v>

57
00:03:06.851 --> 00:03:09.790
<v Speaker 1>of St John.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A powerful order of nights that assisted</v>

58
00:03:09.791 --> 00:03:12.520
<v Speaker 1>in protected Christian pilgrims on their</v>
<v Speaker 1>way to the holy land.</v>

59
00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:13.533
<v Speaker 1>They were given the island of Malta in </v>
<v Speaker 1>15 slash 30 as an outpost to help </v>

60
00:03:16.361 --> 00:03:19.090
<v Speaker 1>prevent an automated invasion of Rome </v>
<v Speaker 1>from the south.</v>

61
00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:20.553
<v Speaker 1>They made Italian the official language </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the island and it remained the </v>

62
00:03:22.961 --> 00:03:23.794
<v Speaker 1>official language until 1934.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This resulted in a large amount of </v>

63
00:03:26.741 --> 00:03:28.990
<v Speaker 1>Italian vocabulary entering the </v>
<v Speaker 1>language.</v>

64
00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:29.973
<v Speaker 1>There was also a period of two years </v>
<v Speaker 1>when Melissa was under French rule and </v>

65
00:03:32.561 --> 00:03:33.394
<v Speaker 1>just from those two years quite a bit of</v>
<v Speaker 1>French vocabulary entered the language </v>

66
00:03:35.981 --> 00:03:40.450
<v Speaker 1>too and the island was a British </v>
<v Speaker 1>protectorate from 1800 to 1956.</v>

67
00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:44.070
<v Speaker 1>And of course that led to the adoption </v>
<v Speaker 1>of lots of English words into Maltese.</v>

68
00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:48.250
<v Speaker 1>So multis is essentially an Arabic </v>
<v Speaker 1>dialect that has become latinized and to</v>

69
00:03:48.251 --> 00:03:52.300
<v Speaker 1>some extent anglicised.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So how similar is it to Arabic today?</v>

70
00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:53.343
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you know Arabic and you try to read </v>

71
00:03:54.581 --> 00:03:55.414
<v Speaker 1>some Maltese,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you will quickly realize that it's </v>

72
00:03:56.801 --> 00:03:57.634
<v Speaker 1>basically Arabic instructor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you will also see a lot of foreign </v>

73
00:04:00.251 --> 00:04:01.084
<v Speaker 1>vocabulary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mostly romance vocabulary in it's most </v>

74
00:04:03.251 --> 00:04:05.440
<v Speaker 1>similar to the mug.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Grab dialects of Arabic,</v>

75
00:04:05.441 --> 00:04:07.990
<v Speaker 1>meaning the dialects of Morocco,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Algeria and Tunisia,</v>

76
00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:08.883
<v Speaker 1>especially the Tunisian dialect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of Tunisians claim that they can </v>

77
00:04:11.591 --> 00:04:12.424
<v Speaker 1>quite easily understand multis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That could be because Tunisian Arabic </v>

78
00:04:15.341 --> 00:04:16.174
<v Speaker 1>itself has quite a few Italian loan </v>
<v Speaker 1>words and I also understand that a lot </v>

79
00:04:18.821 --> 00:04:21.340
<v Speaker 1>of Tunisians can understand standard </v>
<v Speaker 1>Italian,</v>

80
00:04:21.341 --> 00:04:22.174
<v Speaker 1>so if they speak and Arabic and Italian </v>
<v Speaker 1>than they can quite easily understand </v>

81
00:04:25.421 --> 00:04:26.140
<v Speaker 1>multis.</v>

82
00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:28.900
<v Speaker 1>Lots of people say that if you know an </v>
<v Speaker 1>Arabic dialect quite well,</v>

83
00:04:28.901 --> 00:04:29.734
<v Speaker 1>and if you also know Italian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then reading Maltese won't be much of a </v>

84
00:04:32.141 --> 00:04:32.974
<v Speaker 1>problem and with some adjustment you can</v>
<v Speaker 1>also learn to understand it fairly </v>

85
00:04:36.011 --> 00:04:38.110
<v Speaker 1>easily.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't mean you could speak proper</v>

86
00:04:38.111 --> 00:04:39.970
<v Speaker 1>Maltese,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but maybe you could use your Arabic,</v>

87
00:04:39.971 --> 00:04:43.540
<v Speaker 1>endure Italian and sort of pack a </v>
<v Speaker 1>conversation in a new pigeon language.</v>

88
00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:46.780
<v Speaker 1>So let's look at a couple examples.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sentences of multis.</v>

89
00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:50.170
<v Speaker 1>So this sentence here is an example of </v>
<v Speaker 1>one that's mostly Arabic.</v>

90
00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:52.360
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never learned to speak Maltese,</v>

91
00:04:52.361 --> 00:04:56.430
<v Speaker 1>so forgive my pronunciation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It'll Japa Nandua last populates.</v>

92
00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:01.480
<v Speaker 1>That buck dot mia situ ushered in </v>
<v Speaker 1>million petta sooner.</v>

93
00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:03.730
<v Speaker 1>Now I understood this sentence almost </v>
<v Speaker 1>perfectly,</v>

94
00:05:03.731 --> 00:05:05.850
<v Speaker 1>and it's basically all Arabic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

95
00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:07.030
<v Speaker 1>the first word,</v>
<v Speaker 1>illegit boone.</v>

96
00:05:07.031 --> 00:05:10.340
<v Speaker 1>That's Japan on blue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's has a last shot.</v>

97
00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:13.460
<v Speaker 1>That's the 10th.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the biggest pool.</v>

98
00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:15.310
<v Speaker 1>That's the one that's not Arabic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's,</v>

99
00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:17.660
<v Speaker 1>that looks like an Italian lone word to </v>
<v Speaker 1>me type thing.</v>

100
00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:19.660
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's in the world.</v>

101
00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:21.870
<v Speaker 1>The appetite mean that means with more </v>
<v Speaker 1>of them.</v>

102
00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:22.803
<v Speaker 1>And then there's the Arabic number,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mia said to ocean and then there's </v>

103
00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:28.770
<v Speaker 1>mulloon which is million and Arabic too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then pepper summa,</v>

104
00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:29.613
<v Speaker 1>which is not Arabic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I guess that's from Italian </v>

105
00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:32.103
<v Speaker 1>Sicilian.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But sometimes you see sentences with a </v>

106
00:05:33.431 --> 00:05:35.560
<v Speaker 1>lot more loan words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>particularly Italian.</v>

107
00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:36.573
<v Speaker 1>Here's another sentence you form a field</v>
<v Speaker 1>of [inaudible] on that includes the </v>

108
00:05:39.211 --> 00:05:41.070
<v Speaker 1>other printer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pewter Solid Arrietta.</v>

109
00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:42.093
<v Speaker 1>So this sentence means migration reform </v>
<v Speaker 1>must include the principle of </v>

110
00:05:44.951 --> 00:05:47.080
<v Speaker 1>solidarity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This one has a lot of loan words.</v>

111
00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:49.270
<v Speaker 1>The Pharma,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not an Arabic word,</v>

112
00:05:49.271 --> 00:05:51.940
<v Speaker 1>that's alone word feeling bigger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That sione field,</v>

113
00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:53.410
<v Speaker 1>that part is Arabic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but make it.</v>

114
00:05:53.411 --> 00:05:57.680
<v Speaker 1>That's the one that is a long word under</v>
<v Speaker 1>that part is interesting because this is</v>

115
00:05:57.681 --> 00:06:01.240
<v Speaker 1>an Arabic word that means has,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in this case it's being used to mean</v>

116
00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:03.950
<v Speaker 1>has to or must and it's not used that </v>
<v Speaker 1>way in Arabic,</v>

117
00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:07.760
<v Speaker 1>so the function of this word has become </v>
<v Speaker 1>somewhat adapted in the multis language.</v>

118
00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:12.170
<v Speaker 1>The next word included.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's include but that the t links back</v>

119
00:06:12.171 --> 00:06:14.990
<v Speaker 1>to the previous vowel and that's an </v>
<v Speaker 1>element of Arabic syntax.</v>

120
00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:17.980
<v Speaker 1>The next word friendship you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's obviously principal,</v>

121
00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:20.030
<v Speaker 1>but that's not an Arabic word.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a long word.</v>

122
00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:21.620
<v Speaker 1>And tests.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Solar Data Yetta.</v>

123
00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:22.603
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the Arabic definite article and </v>

124
00:06:23.841 --> 00:06:27.070
<v Speaker 1>the t is linking back to the previous </v>
<v Speaker 1>vowel and solid data yetta.</v>

125
00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:29.750
<v Speaker 1>That's solidarity and that's not an </v>
<v Speaker 1>Arabic word either,</v>

126
00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:32.450
<v Speaker 1>so you can see a lot of sentences like </v>
<v Speaker 1>this and Maltese.</v>

127
00:06:32.451 --> 00:06:35.210
<v Speaker 1>Often if you have no Arabic you'll </v>
<v Speaker 1>recognize the structure,</v>

128
00:06:35.211 --> 00:06:37.220
<v Speaker 1>but then a lot of the words are not </v>
<v Speaker 1>Arabic.</v>

129
00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:40.370
<v Speaker 1>For me personally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know that with my past study of Arabic</v>

130
00:06:40.371 --> 00:06:43.610
<v Speaker 1>and with my fluency in English and my </v>
<v Speaker 1>recent basic knowledge of Italian,</v>

131
00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:47.300
<v Speaker 1>I can take a stab at reading multis and </v>
<v Speaker 1>I can understand a fair bit of it,</v>

132
00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:48.260
<v Speaker 1>but not all of it.</v>

133
00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:50.930
<v Speaker 1>When I hear spoken Maltese,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't really understand it,</v>

134
00:06:50.931 --> 00:06:54.800
<v Speaker 1>but I can pick out some individual </v>
<v Speaker 1>Arabic and Italian and English words,</v>

135
00:06:54.950 --> 00:06:57.050
<v Speaker 1>but I imagined that as my Italian </v>
<v Speaker 1>improves,</v>

136
00:06:57.051 --> 00:06:57.884
<v Speaker 1>I'll be able to understand a bit more of</v>
<v Speaker 1>it and if I decided to review my Arabic </v>

137
00:07:01.281 --> 00:07:03.950
<v Speaker 1>in depth and start to learn on my grubby</v>
<v Speaker 1>dialect,</v>

138
00:07:03.951 --> 00:07:07.160
<v Speaker 1>then I think I would be able to </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand a lot more Maltese as well.</v>

139
00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:09.500
<v Speaker 1>Maltese is not a very widely spoken </v>
<v Speaker 1>language,</v>

140
00:07:09.501 --> 00:07:10.334
<v Speaker 1>so not that many people learn it and </v>
<v Speaker 1>there aren't that many materials out </v>

141
00:07:12.471 --> 00:07:15.200
<v Speaker 1>there for learners,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but for someone who's learning Arabic or</v>

142
00:07:15.201 --> 00:07:16.034
<v Speaker 1>learning Italian than it might be fun to</v>
<v Speaker 1>dabble in some multis and see what you </v>

143
00:07:18.921 --> 00:07:19.754
<v Speaker 1>can make of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank you for watching the length focus </v>

<v Speaker 1>If you're an Arabic speaker and you've </v>
<v Speaker 1>had a chance to listen to multis a </v>

148

<v Speaker 1>little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let us know what you think.</v>

149
00:07:31.101 --> 00:07:33.860
<v Speaker 1>Can you understand it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does it sound like a kind of Arabic?</v>

150
00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:36.880
<v Speaker 1>And the same goes for Italian speakers.</v>

154
00:07:45.111 --> 00:07:45.944
<v Speaker 1>I'm quite excited about that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if I look at my social media </v>

155
00:07:48.441 --> 00:07:50.000
<v Speaker 1>channels,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I look at facebook,</v>

156
00:07:50.001 --> 00:07:51.380
<v Speaker 1>twitter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Instagram,</v>

157
00:07:51.381 --> 00:07:53.450
