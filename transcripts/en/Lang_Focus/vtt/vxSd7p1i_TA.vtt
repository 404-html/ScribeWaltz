00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:08.703
<v Speaker 1>Hello everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Welcome to the Lange Focus Channel and </v>

2
00:00:10.481 --> 00:00:11.314
<v Speaker 1>my name is Paul.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Today I'm going to be talking about a </v>

3
00:00:13.091 --> 00:00:17.530
<v Speaker 1>language called Hindus stanny or it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes called Hindus standing.</v>

4
00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:18.890
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

5
00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:21.140
<v Speaker 1>There are countries with names like </v>
<v Speaker 1>Pakistan,</v>

6
00:00:21.141 --> 00:00:22.480
<v Speaker 1>Afghanistan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kazic,</v>

7
00:00:22.481 --> 00:00:24.980
<v Speaker 1>Stan is there a country called </v>
<v Speaker 1>Hindustan?</v>

8
00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:26.173
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of at certain points throughout </v>

9
00:00:27.651 --> 00:00:28.484
<v Speaker 1>history at the term,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hindustan has been used to refer to all </v>

10
00:00:30.801 --> 00:00:31.634
<v Speaker 1>of India,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but more generally it is used to refer </v>

11
00:00:33.741 --> 00:00:36.440
<v Speaker 1>to the area of the northern Indian sub </v>
<v Speaker 1>continent.</v>

12
00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:39.020
<v Speaker 1>The term Hindustan itself is a Persian </v>
<v Speaker 1>term,</v>

13
00:00:39.021 --> 00:00:43.010
<v Speaker 1>meaning the land of the Indus River.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hindustan Steny is a language that arose</v>

14
00:00:43.011 --> 00:00:43.844
<v Speaker 1>in the Hindustan region.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you've never heard of Hindu </v>

15
00:00:45.931 --> 00:00:46.764
<v Speaker 1>standing before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you've probably heard of Hindi and </v>

16
00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:49.483
<v Speaker 1>Urdu.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hindi standing is a clery centric </v>

17
00:00:51.201 --> 00:00:53.420
<v Speaker 1>language,</v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning that it's a single language that</v>

18
00:00:53.421 --> 00:00:55.940
<v Speaker 1>has two different standard varieties.</v>

19
00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:58.080
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

20
00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:00.960
<v Speaker 1>Even though Hindi and Urdu are referred </v>
<v Speaker 1>to by different names,</v>

21
00:01:00.961 --> 00:01:03.270
<v Speaker 1>the spoken language is essentially the </v>
<v Speaker 1>same.</v>

22
00:01:03.271 --> 00:01:07.590
<v Speaker 1>Aside from some differences and accent </v>
<v Speaker 1>and maybe local regional vocabulary.</v>

23
00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.270
<v Speaker 1>The standard languages,</v>
<v Speaker 1>however,</v>

24
00:01:09.271 --> 00:01:10.104
<v Speaker 1>which are used in writing and in formal </v>
<v Speaker 1>situations have more significant </v>

25
00:01:13.261 --> 00:01:17.490
<v Speaker 1>differences that reflect the cultural </v>
<v Speaker 1>and religious identity of the speakers,</v>

26
00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:18.893
<v Speaker 1>but the development of these two </v>
<v Speaker 1>standard languages is a recent </v>

27
00:01:21.091 --> 00:01:21.924
<v Speaker 1>phenomenon for most of us history.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hinder standing was a single language </v>

28
00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.940
<v Speaker 1>that was referred to by various </v>
<v Speaker 1>different names.</v>

29
00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:31.230
<v Speaker 1>Hindustan he has spoken as a native </v>
<v Speaker 1>language by lots and lots of people.</v>

30
00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.760
<v Speaker 1>It depends on how you count it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but around 324 million people are native</v>

31
00:01:35.761 --> 00:01:36.594
<v Speaker 1>speakers of either Hindi or Urdu.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are about 258 million speakers of </v>

32
00:01:40.711 --> 00:01:45.711
<v Speaker 1>Hindi in India and about 52 million </v>
<v Speaker 1>speakers of Urdu in India and 14.7</v>

33
00:01:46.141 --> 00:01:46.974
<v Speaker 1>million speakers of through do in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Pakistan and that's referring to native </v>

34
00:01:50.011 --> 00:01:50.700
<v Speaker 1>speakers.</v>

35
00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.840
<v Speaker 1>They also function as Lingua Franca is </v>
<v Speaker 1>in very linguistically diverse regions.</v>

36
00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:59.370
<v Speaker 1>There are an additional 214000002nd </v>
<v Speaker 1>language speakers of Hindu standing.</v>

37
00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:00.323
<v Speaker 1>This is perhaps most striking in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Pakistan were only 8% of the people </v>

38
00:02:03.511 --> 00:02:07.650
<v Speaker 1>speak Urdu as a native language,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but over 94 million people speak it as a</v>

39
00:02:07.651 --> 00:02:11.460
<v Speaker 1>second language because it is widely </v>
<v Speaker 1>learned as the language of education.</v>

40
00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:15.750
<v Speaker 1>There are also 120000002nd language </v>
<v Speaker 1>speakers of Hindi in India,</v>

41
00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:16.673
<v Speaker 1>so if we include both native speakers </v>
<v Speaker 1>and second language speakers of both </v>

42
00:02:19.531 --> 00:02:20.364
<v Speaker 1>varieties of Hindu standing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then there are about 538 million </v>

43
00:02:23.551 --> 00:02:27.240
<v Speaker 1>speakers of the language hinders </v>
<v Speaker 1>standing as a member of the Indo area in</v>

44
00:02:27.241 --> 00:02:32.140
<v Speaker 1>branch of the Indo European language </v>
<v Speaker 1>family and it's a descendant of the Sora</v>

45
00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.973
<v Speaker 1>Seine Prek read language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The language from which all modern Indo </v>

46
00:02:34.801 --> 00:02:35.634
<v Speaker 1>area in language is descended from and </v>
<v Speaker 1>if we go back earlier than the </v>

47
00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:41.190
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] language,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is a descendant of Sanskrit,</v>

48
00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:45.900
<v Speaker 1>early forms of Hindu standing developed </v>
<v Speaker 1>between the seventh to 13th century CE,</v>

49
00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:46.913
<v Speaker 1>a time of heavy Islamic influence on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Indian subcontinent due to conquest by </v>

50
00:02:50.671 --> 00:02:52.560
<v Speaker 1>Central Asian Turkic invaders.</v>

51
00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:55.540
<v Speaker 1>Then in the 13th century CE,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Deli sultanate,</v>

52
00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.560
<v Speaker 1>it began its rule and expanded this </v>
<v Speaker 1>Islamic influence.</v>

53
00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:01.840
<v Speaker 1>Hindu standing was the language of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>common people around Delhi.</v>

54
00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:02.703
<v Speaker 1>While Persian became the official state </v>
<v Speaker 1>language and language of the courts and </v>

55
00:03:05.651 --> 00:03:06.484
<v Speaker 1>the language of the elite.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Deli sultanate was a Muslim kingdom </v>

56
00:03:09.131 --> 00:03:12.910
<v Speaker 1>which was ruled by a success of Turkic </v>
<v Speaker 1>and Afghan dynasties.</v>

57
00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:13.923
<v Speaker 1>These dynasties were personalized,</v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning that they looked up to and </v>

58
00:03:16.451 --> 00:03:19.630
<v Speaker 1>admired the Persian culture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they brought the Persian language and</v>

59
00:03:19.631 --> 00:03:23.470
<v Speaker 1>its literary traditions with them to </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand and they also spoke their own</v>

60
00:03:23.471 --> 00:03:25.930
<v Speaker 1>native languages among them Turkic </v>
<v Speaker 1>languages.</v>

61
00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:27.003
<v Speaker 1>They were followed by the Mughal empire </v>
<v Speaker 1>in 1526 they were another person as to </v>

62
00:03:30.671 --> 00:03:33.640
<v Speaker 1>people of Turkic Mongol descent and like</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Deli salt in it.</v>

63
00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:36.520
<v Speaker 1>They introduced Persian as the official </v>
<v Speaker 1>language of the empire,</v>

64
00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:40.720
<v Speaker 1>the Lingua Franca of the elite people </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the prestigious literary language.</v>

65
00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:43.443
<v Speaker 1>At the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Arabic was influential as a language of </v>

66
00:03:45.491 --> 00:03:46.324
<v Speaker 1>religion during this time Hindustan me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was known by different names such </v>

67
00:03:49.271 --> 00:03:50.104
<v Speaker 1>as [inaudible] and they lovey spread </v>
<v Speaker 1>over much of the northern Indian sub </v>

68
00:03:53.021 --> 00:03:53.854
<v Speaker 1>continent as a Lingua Franca.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Although there were some local </v>

69
00:03:55.781 --> 00:03:56.614
<v Speaker 1>differences in vocabulary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The influence of Persian during these </v>

70
00:03:58.961 --> 00:03:59.794
<v Speaker 1>dynasties as well as the status of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Arabic as the language of religion had </v>

71
00:04:03.131 --> 00:04:05.050
<v Speaker 1>an impact on the Hindu standing </v>
<v Speaker 1>language,</v>

72
00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:05.913
<v Speaker 1>but the degree of that impact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it depended on the local area and the </v>

73
00:04:08.531 --> 00:04:10.600
<v Speaker 1>culture and the religion of that </v>
<v Speaker 1>community.</v>

74
00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:11.583
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Muslim communities used more Arabic and </v>

75
00:04:13.661 --> 00:04:17.770
<v Speaker 1>Persian words and wrote in the pair,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so Arabic script called Nesta leak while</v>

76
00:04:17.771 --> 00:04:21.970
<v Speaker 1>Hindu communities used more sanskrit </v>
<v Speaker 1>words and wrote in the Devanagari script</v>

77
00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:26.110
<v Speaker 1>in the 18th century,</v>
<v Speaker 1>towards the end of the Mughal empire,</v>

78
00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:27.033
<v Speaker 1>a form of Hindu standing based on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Kirribilli dialect of Delhi came to </v>

79
00:04:30.341 --> 00:04:34.930
<v Speaker 1>replace Persian as the language of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>elite and soon after under British rule,</v>

80
00:04:34.931 --> 00:04:37.570
<v Speaker 1>it became the official language along </v>
<v Speaker 1>with English.</v>

81
00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:41.230
<v Speaker 1>It was a variety of Hindu standing </v>
<v Speaker 1>containing Persian vocabulary.</v>

82
00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:43.750
<v Speaker 1>Another name for that language started </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be used,</v>

83
00:04:43.751 --> 00:04:44.584
<v Speaker 1>which was Urdu.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That name Urdu is a shortened form of </v>

84
00:04:47.021 --> 00:04:48.890
<v Speaker 1>the Persian phrase is urban,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a Odu,</v>

85
00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:49.773
<v Speaker 1>which means language of the camp.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is because the language was the </v>

86
00:04:52.331 --> 00:04:53.164
<v Speaker 1>Lingua Franca of the moog out army and </v>
<v Speaker 1>was used in their army camps until this </v>

87
00:04:56.711 --> 00:04:57.544
<v Speaker 1>Persian ised variety of Hindu standing </v>
<v Speaker 1>was made the official language </v>

88
00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:01.313
<v Speaker 1>Hindustan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was considered a single language for </v>

89
00:05:02.711 --> 00:05:05.260
<v Speaker 1>all communities with mere local </v>
<v Speaker 1>variations,</v>

90
00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:06.183
<v Speaker 1>but when the [inaudible] variety written</v>
<v Speaker 1>and nostalgic script was made an </v>

91
00:05:08.711 --> 00:05:12.010
<v Speaker 1>official language by the British,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this angered Hindus who thought that the</v>

92
00:05:12.011 --> 00:05:14.320
<v Speaker 1>language should be written in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Devanagari script,</v>

93
00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:15.333
<v Speaker 1>which is native to the sub continent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This erupted into a major dispute over </v>

94
00:05:18.641 --> 00:05:20.500
<v Speaker 1>which script the language should be </v>
<v Speaker 1>written in.</v>

95
00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:21.423
<v Speaker 1>Amid this dispute,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the standard language of Hindu standing </v>

96
00:05:23.041 --> 00:05:23.874
<v Speaker 1>began to diverged into two different </v>
<v Speaker 1>languages with Hindi drawing on sense </v>

97
00:05:27.211 --> 00:05:30.940
<v Speaker 1>greed for much of its formal vocabulary </v>
<v Speaker 1>and purging the language of some of it's</v>

98
00:05:30.941 --> 00:05:32.650
<v Speaker 1>Persian and Arabic vocabulary.</v>

99
00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:33.823
<v Speaker 1>Urdu went the other direction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>purging the language of some of its </v>

100
00:05:35.921 --> 00:05:36.754
<v Speaker 1>sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>great vocabulary and expanding the </v>

101
00:05:38.051 --> 00:05:38.884
<v Speaker 1>amount of Persian and Arabic vocabulary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But this applies mainly to the standard </v>

102
00:05:42.071 --> 00:05:42.904
<v Speaker 1>written languages with the spoken </v>
<v Speaker 1>language is remaining almost completely </v>

103
00:05:45.401 --> 00:05:48.220
<v Speaker 1>intelligible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When a Hindi speaker and an Urdu speaker</v>

104
00:05:48.221 --> 00:05:49.054
<v Speaker 1>encounter each other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have no problem communicating at </v>

105
00:05:50.921 --> 00:05:53.080
<v Speaker 1>all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There might be some different vocabulary</v>

106
00:05:53.081 --> 00:05:53.914
<v Speaker 1>that filters down from the literary </v>
<v Speaker 1>language and there might be some </v>

107
00:05:55.751 --> 00:05:56.584
<v Speaker 1>different vocabulary coming from local </v>
<v Speaker 1>dialects and there might be a slightly </v>

108
00:05:59.301 --> 00:06:00.134
<v Speaker 1>different accent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but generally they are not very </v>

109
00:06:01.491 --> 00:06:02.960
<v Speaker 1>different at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

110
00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:06.220
<v Speaker 1>bollywood movies are created in a kind </v>
<v Speaker 1>of neutral Hindustan.</v>

111
00:06:06.221 --> 00:06:08.780
<v Speaker 1>The language that is usually neither </v>
<v Speaker 1>Hindi nor [inaudible],</v>

112
00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:10.220
<v Speaker 1>it's both.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To do this,</v>

113
00:06:10.221 --> 00:06:11.054
<v Speaker 1>they avoid using literary vocabulary </v>
<v Speaker 1>that is specific to either language and </v>

114
00:06:14.151 --> 00:06:17.300
<v Speaker 1>they focus on the common vocabulary of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the spoken languages.</v>

115
00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:22.190
<v Speaker 1>Let's look at a couple of sentences to </v>
<v Speaker 1>see how similar the two languages are in</v>

116
00:06:22.191 --> 00:06:25.670
<v Speaker 1>casual speech and how they diverged in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the more formal register.</v>

117
00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:30.230
<v Speaker 1>The first sentence means I want to meet </v>
<v Speaker 1>you first in casual Urdu</v>

118
00:06:30.450 --> 00:06:31.283
<v Speaker 3>math.</v>

119
00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:37.960
<v Speaker 1>Now in casual Hindi Ma [inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 1>So as you can see,</v>

120
00:06:38.391 --> 00:06:43.040
<v Speaker 1>the casual forms are quite similar or </v>
<v Speaker 1>almost the same now in literary or do</v>

121
00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:44.573
<v Speaker 3>map</v>

122
00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:51.500
<v Speaker 1>now in literary Hindi,</v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] Opsm malicky come not hair.</v>

123
00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:55.610
<v Speaker 1>In the literary forms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can see that the vocabulary is quite</v>

124
00:06:55.611 --> 00:06:57.320
<v Speaker 1>different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The next sentence,</v>

125
00:06:57.380 --> 00:07:00.680
<v Speaker 1>I want to know how you are in casual </v>
<v Speaker 1>Urdu</v>

126
00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:01.873
<v Speaker 3>map</v>

127
00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:08.990
<v Speaker 1>now when casual Hindi,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Matt [inaudible] who in literary or do</v>

128
00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:19.830
<v Speaker 1>and now in literary Hindi,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Matt [inaudible].</v>

129
00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:21.993
<v Speaker 1>These examples basically showed that </v>
<v Speaker 1>Hindustan he has a single language but </v>

130
00:07:24.551 --> 00:07:25.384
<v Speaker 1>that literary Urdu and literary kindie </v>
<v Speaker 1>have been crafted to reflect the </v>

131
00:07:28.781 --> 00:07:31.690
<v Speaker 1>different religious and literary </v>
<v Speaker 1>traditions of their speakers.</v>

132
00:07:31.810 --> 00:07:32.643
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would be a mistake to think that all </v>

133
00:07:33.701 --> 00:07:34.534
<v Speaker 1>Muslims on the Indian sub continent </v>
<v Speaker 1>speak Urdu and that all Hindus speak </v>

134
00:07:37.781 --> 00:07:39.370
<v Speaker 1>Hindi,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but think of it like this.</v>

135
00:07:39.371 --> 00:07:40.204
<v Speaker 1>For people who specifically speak Hindi </v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] their religion basically </v>

136
00:07:43.121 --> 00:07:45.760
<v Speaker 1>determines which one they speak Hindi or</v>
<v Speaker 1>Urdu.</v>

137
00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.450
<v Speaker 1>It would also be a mistake to think that</v>
<v Speaker 1>Urdu is the Pakistani language.</v>

138
00:07:49.451 --> 00:07:50.284
<v Speaker 1>While Hindi is the Indian language,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Urdu is the official language of </v>

139
00:07:52.841 --> 00:07:53.674
<v Speaker 1>Pakistan along with English,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in fact only 8% of the population </v>

140
00:07:56.980 --> 00:07:59.200
<v Speaker 1>are native speakers of Urdu.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As I said before,</v>

141
00:07:59.530 --> 00:08:00.363
<v Speaker 1>numerous other languages are spoken in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Pakistan and the most widely spoken one </v>

142
00:08:03.161 --> 00:08:03.994
<v Speaker 1>is actually Punjabi,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but Urdu is the lingua franca and </v>

143
00:08:06.221 --> 00:08:07.780
<v Speaker 1>virtually everybody learns it.</v>

144
00:08:08.110 --> 00:08:08.943
<v Speaker 1>In India,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hindi and English are the official </v>

145
00:08:10.631 --> 00:08:14.350
<v Speaker 1>languages at the national level,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but each state is free to choose its own</v>

146
00:08:14.351 --> 00:08:15.184
<v Speaker 1>official languages too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are a total of 20 recognized </v>

147
00:08:17.591 --> 00:08:20.530
<v Speaker 1>official languages at the state level </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that includes Urdu.</v>

148
00:08:20.710 --> 00:08:22.870
<v Speaker 1>Urdu is not just the language of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Pakistan,</v>

149
00:08:22.871 --> 00:08:25.660
<v Speaker 1>it's also an official language in eight </v>
<v Speaker 1>states in India,</v>

150
00:08:25.690 --> 00:08:29.710
<v Speaker 1>including the Deli Capitol region.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is spoken by 51.5</v>

151
00:08:29.711 --> 00:08:32.650
<v Speaker 1>million native speakers in India and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's 3.5</v>

152
00:08:32.651 --> 00:08:35.830
<v Speaker 1>times greater than the number of Urdu </v>
<v Speaker 1>native speakers in Pakistan.</v>

153
00:08:35.950 --> 00:08:39.430
<v Speaker 1>So how hard is it to learn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hinder standing either Hindi or Urdu?</v>

154
00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:40.593
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're a speaker of an Indo European </v>

155
00:08:41.921 --> 00:08:42.754
<v Speaker 1>language than you already speak a </v>
<v Speaker 1>language that's related to hinder </v>

156
00:08:44.921 --> 00:08:47.440
<v Speaker 1>standing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So most of the grammatical concepts will</v>

157
00:08:47.441 --> 00:08:48.274
<v Speaker 1>be familiar to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there will also be some challenging </v>

158
00:08:50.501 --> 00:08:51.334
<v Speaker 1>differences as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we look back at our sentence from </v>

159
00:08:53.291 --> 00:08:57.330
<v Speaker 1>before in English,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it translates something like I you meet,</v>

160
00:08:57.390 --> 00:09:00.420
<v Speaker 1>want English is an Svo language.</v>

161
00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:03.570
<v Speaker 1>While Hindu standing is generally Sov,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that means subject,</v>

162
00:09:03.630 --> 00:09:06.330
<v Speaker 1>object,</v>
<v Speaker 1>verb and the verb goes at the end of the</v>

163
00:09:06.331 --> 00:09:07.164
<v Speaker 1>clause.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You will also notice that meat comes </v>

164
00:09:09.151 --> 00:09:09.984
<v Speaker 1>before once sold.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The auxiliary verb or the helping verb </v>

165
00:09:12.630 --> 00:09:13.463
<v Speaker 1>comes after the main verb.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At the very end of the clause or </v>

166
00:09:15.601 --> 00:09:16.860
<v Speaker 1>sentence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In Hindi,</v>

167
00:09:16.861 --> 00:09:21.120
<v Speaker 1>there are also feminine and masculine </v>
<v Speaker 1>nouns as well as three noun cases,</v>

168
00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:22.133
<v Speaker 1>but these three known cases seems </v>
<v Speaker 1>significantly simpler than some other </v>

169
00:09:24.691 --> 00:09:28.020
<v Speaker 1>languages that you may have encountered.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hungarian.</v>

170
00:09:28.050 --> 00:09:31.410
<v Speaker 1>One of the hardest things about learning</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hindi or Urdu just might be that so many</v>

171
00:09:31.411 --> 00:09:34.140
<v Speaker 1>people on the Indian subcontinent are </v>
<v Speaker 1>fluent in English,</v>

172
00:09:34.141 --> 00:09:34.974
<v Speaker 1>so it might be hard to get them to speak</v>
<v Speaker 1>any other language than English with </v>

173
00:09:37.351 --> 00:09:39.390
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially highly educated people,</v>

174
00:09:39.690 --> 00:09:42.660
<v Speaker 1>but if you spend time with the common </v>
<v Speaker 1>people that you meet every day,</v>

175
00:09:42.661 --> 00:09:44.970
<v Speaker 1>then you'll have plenty of chances to </v>
<v Speaker 1>practice.</v>

176
00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:45.833
<v Speaker 1>Speaking about Hindi and Urdu can be </v>
<v Speaker 1>confusing because they used to be </v>

177
00:09:48.541 --> 00:09:52.290
<v Speaker 1>considered one language and now in terms</v>
<v Speaker 1>of spoken communication,</v>

178
00:09:52.291 --> 00:09:53.124
<v Speaker 1>they are still essentially one language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whether someone speaks Hindi or whether </v>

179
00:09:56.131 --> 00:09:56.964
<v Speaker 1>they speak Urdu,</v>
<v Speaker 1>depends more on their cultural and </v>

180
00:09:59.041 --> 00:09:59.874
<v Speaker 1>religious identity or do speakers </v>
<v Speaker 1>identify with Islamic and Persian </v>

181
00:10:03.031 --> 00:10:07.260
<v Speaker 1>heritage and its literary tradition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While Hindi speakers identify with sense</v>

182
00:10:07.270 --> 00:10:10.260
<v Speaker 1>greet and the Hindu religion and its </v>
<v Speaker 1>literary tradition,</v>

183
00:10:10.470 --> 00:10:13.530
<v Speaker 1>they speak the same language but on top </v>
<v Speaker 1>of that spoken language.</v>

184
00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:14.393
<v Speaker 1>Each group has adopted a formal literary</v>
<v Speaker 1>tradition that emphasizes its preferred </v>

185
00:10:18.241 --> 00:10:21.840
<v Speaker 1>cultural and religious identity as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>learner of the language.</v>

186
00:10:21.841 --> 00:10:24.420
<v Speaker 1>Assuming that you want to converse and </v>
<v Speaker 1>communicate with people.</v>

187
00:10:24.421 --> 00:10:25.254
<v Speaker 1>Then learning either variety,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll give you access to the other one </v>

188
00:10:28.050 --> 00:10:28.883
<v Speaker 1>and that's a total number of 538 million</v>
<v Speaker 1>people and with a diaspora all over the </v>

189
00:10:33.601 --> 00:10:35.610
<v Speaker 1>world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even outside of the sub continent,</v>

190
00:10:35.790 --> 00:10:36.623
<v Speaker 1>you will have countless opportunities to</v>
<v Speaker 1>practice and make new connections using </v>

191
00:10:40.110 --> 00:10:41.400
<v Speaker 1>the [inaudible] language.</v>

192
00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:43.440
<v Speaker 1>And that brings us to the end of this </v>
<v Speaker 1>video.</v>

193
00:10:43.441 --> 00:10:44.274
<v Speaker 1>Speakers of Hindi or Urdu,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'd like to hear your comments down </v>

194
00:10:46.561 --> 00:10:47.394

<v Speaker 1>Tell us your experience with </v>

195
00:10:48.391 --> 00:10:51.960
<v Speaker 1>communicating with people who speak the </v>
<v Speaker 1>other variety of Hindu standing.</v>

196
00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:54.720
<v Speaker 1>Is it the same language to you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How much difference is there?</v>

197
00:10:54.721 --> 00:10:57.600
<v Speaker 1>How much similarity is there?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let us know in the comments.</v>

198
00:10:57.720 --> 00:11:01.440
<v Speaker 1>I would also like to thank everyone who </v>
<v Speaker 1>made new patriot and contributions since</v>

199
00:11:01.441 --> 00:11:02.274

<v Speaker 1>who gave one time donations through the </v>

<v Speaker 1>language.</v>
