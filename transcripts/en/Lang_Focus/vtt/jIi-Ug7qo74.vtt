00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:07.693
<v Speaker 1>Good day everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is Paul and you are watching the </v>

2
00:00:09.831 --> 00:00:10.664
<v Speaker 1>langue focus Janel and today we're going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to talk about that some interesting </v>

3
00:00:13.551 --> 00:00:15.620
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to talk about the difference</v>

4
00:00:15.621 --> 00:00:18.830
<v Speaker 1>between a language and a dialect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

5
00:00:18.831 --> 00:00:22.220
<v Speaker 1>what is the difference all over the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world there are people who speak closely</v>

6
00:00:22.221 --> 00:00:23.054
<v Speaker 1>related forms of communication.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes they are called different </v>

7
00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:27.313
<v Speaker 1>languages.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes they are called dialects of </v>

8
00:00:28.761 --> 00:00:31.580
<v Speaker 1>one language,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so how do we decide which one they are?</v>

9
00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:32.443
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes there's some disagreement </v>
<v Speaker 1>about which one a particular form of </v>

10
00:00:35.031 --> 00:00:35.864
<v Speaker 1>communication is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it a dialect or is it a separate </v>

11
00:00:37.611 --> 00:00:40.970
<v Speaker 1>language?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The dialect really means in a variety of</v>

12
00:00:40.971 --> 00:00:41.804
<v Speaker 1>speech that differs somewhat from </v>
<v Speaker 1>another variety of speech of that same </v>

13
00:00:45.981 --> 00:00:49.010
<v Speaker 1>language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It could differ in grammar,</v>

14
00:00:49.011 --> 00:00:51.410
<v Speaker 1>it could differ in phonology or </v>
<v Speaker 1>pronunciation.</v>

15
00:00:51.411 --> 00:00:53.750
<v Speaker 1>It could.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Different vocabulary could different.</v>

16
00:00:53.751 --> 00:00:54.584
<v Speaker 1>All of those may be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes those dialects are based in </v>

17
00:00:57.501 --> 00:00:58.640
<v Speaker 1>different regions.</v>

18
00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:00.440
<v Speaker 1>They are regional varieties of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>language.</v>

19
00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:03.170
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes they are ethnic varieties of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>language.</v>

20
00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:06.560
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe there are two ethnic groups living</v>

21
00:01:06.561 --> 00:01:07.394
<v Speaker 1>in a city,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but historically they've lived separate </v>

22
00:01:09.111 --> 00:01:12.920
<v Speaker 1>and not really interacted with each </v>
<v Speaker 1>other because of racism or whatever.</v>

23
00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:16.340
<v Speaker 1>And they've developed a separate dialect</v>
<v Speaker 1>because of that separation.</v>

24
00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:19.490
<v Speaker 1>So they're almost living in two worlds </v>
<v Speaker 1>within the same city,</v>

25
00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:22.160
<v Speaker 1>that kind of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's almost like a different regional</v>

26
00:01:22.161 --> 00:01:25.520
<v Speaker 1>dialect inside your your on talent if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I'm in now,</v>

27
00:01:25.521 --> 00:01:29.390
<v Speaker 1>within every language there is some </v>
<v Speaker 1>degree of variety,</v>

28
00:01:29.391 --> 00:01:30.224
<v Speaker 1>some degree of difference.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are some different spoken </v>

29
00:01:32.571 --> 00:01:36.710
<v Speaker 1>varieties of every language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So how do we decide if it's close enough</v>

30
00:01:36.711 --> 00:01:39.560
<v Speaker 1>to the language to be considered a </v>
<v Speaker 1>dialect and when is it not?</v>

31
00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:40.723
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the men criteria that is most </v>

32
00:01:42.561 --> 00:01:43.394
<v Speaker 1>often used is mutual intelligibility.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That means the speakers of those two </v>

33
00:01:47.271 --> 00:01:48.104
<v Speaker 1>different varieties of the language can </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand each other fully or almost </v>

34
00:01:52.251 --> 00:01:53.450
<v Speaker 1>fully understand each other.</v>

35
00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:56.240
<v Speaker 1>We would say they're mutually </v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligible in that case.</v>

36
00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:00.170
<v Speaker 1>So according to this definition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>simply if you can understand each other,</v>

37
00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:03.170
<v Speaker 1>you can understand them and you can make</v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself understood to them,</v>

38
00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:04.183
<v Speaker 1>then you are speaking the same language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if even if there's some degree of </v>

39
00:02:07.281 --> 00:02:10.790
<v Speaker 1>difference in grammar or phonology or </v>
<v Speaker 1>vocabulary,</v>

40
00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:14.660
<v Speaker 1>those are just dialectal differences </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you can understand each other.</v>

41
00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:15.613
<v Speaker 1>The languages are close enough that they</v>
<v Speaker 1>are considered the same language </v>

42
00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:19.543
<v Speaker 1>according to that definition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now the problem with this definition is </v>

43
00:02:22.221 --> 00:02:23.054
<v Speaker 1>that sometimes speakers of what is </v>
<v Speaker 1>considered to be one language often </v>

44
00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:28.430
<v Speaker 1>can't understand each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like for example,</v>

45
00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:32.540
<v Speaker 1>often I can't understand people who </v>
<v Speaker 1>speak a Scottish dialect of English.</v>

46
00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:37.213
<v Speaker 2>When I say it to somebody else,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll tell you about you finally got the </v>

47
00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:45.653
<v Speaker 2>boys.</v>

48
00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:49.593
<v Speaker 1>Often,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't understand people who speak a </v>

49
00:02:51.221 --> 00:02:55.120
<v Speaker 1>Scottish dialect of English or sometimes</v>
<v Speaker 1>an Australian dialect of English.</v>

50
00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:57.850
<v Speaker 1>If they come from like the deep </v>
<v Speaker 1>countryside of Australia,</v>

51
00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:58.803
<v Speaker 1>sometimes I can't them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is especially true if I </v>

52
00:03:01.661 --> 00:03:04.600
<v Speaker 1>overhear two of those people speaking </v>
<v Speaker 1>together,</v>

53
00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:06.970
<v Speaker 1>I hear them speaking with each other and</v>
<v Speaker 1>not directly to me.</v>

54
00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:09.670
<v Speaker 1>Then they'll speak in their full on </v>
<v Speaker 1>different accent,</v>

55
00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:11.980
<v Speaker 1>different dialect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and sometimes I can't understand.</v>

56
00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:16.240
<v Speaker 1>So are we speaking a different language </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's not mutually intelligible.</v>

57
00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:19.390
<v Speaker 1>So that's kind of the difficult point of</v>
<v Speaker 1>this definition.</v>

58
00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:21.910
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes I can't understand other </v>
<v Speaker 1>speakers of English,</v>

59
00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:24.460
<v Speaker 1>but I think it's the same language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so do they.</v>

60
00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:28.000
<v Speaker 1>So what's going on there?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that brings me to another criteria of</v>

61
00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:29.073
<v Speaker 1>what would make to spoken varieties just</v>
<v Speaker 1>to dialects of one language and that is </v>

62
00:03:32.621 --> 00:03:33.454
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Both of those varieties used the same </v>

63
00:03:35.141 --> 00:03:37.810
<v Speaker 1>written standard variety of language.</v>

64
00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:40.450
<v Speaker 1>These are the same written standard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the same written language.</v>

65
00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:41.613
<v Speaker 1>Even though the spoken language means </v>
<v Speaker 1>differ somewhat so that would explain </v>

66
00:03:44.891 --> 00:03:45.724
<v Speaker 1>why I speak English and a Scottish </v>
<v Speaker 1>person speaks English even if there may </v>

67
00:03:48.701 --> 00:03:51.910
<v Speaker 1>be some trouble communicating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We both use the same written language.</v>

68
00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:52.893
<v Speaker 1>You both rate in the same way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We read the same books and then when we </v>

69
00:03:55.841 --> 00:04:00.100
<v Speaker 1>speak to each other we can adapt our </v>
<v Speaker 1>speech to make it a little bit more like</v>

70
00:04:00.101 --> 00:04:00.934
<v Speaker 1>the written standard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now that's why we can communicate even </v>

71
00:04:03.461 --> 00:04:04.294
<v Speaker 1>though I can't really understand their </v>
<v Speaker 1>variety of English when they speak the </v>

72
00:04:07.691 --> 00:04:09.460
<v Speaker 1>pure form,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they speak it with each other,</v>

73
00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:10.473
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't really know what they're saying </v>

74
00:04:11.081 --> 00:04:11.914
<v Speaker 1>a lot of the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when they speak to me they kind of </v>

75
00:04:13.331 --> 00:04:15.610
<v Speaker 1>use a book English a little bit literary</v>
<v Speaker 1>English.</v>

76
00:04:15.611 --> 00:04:19.780
<v Speaker 1>They use more of the written standard </v>
<v Speaker 1>and mix it in with their natural dialect</v>

77
00:04:19.781 --> 00:04:21.220
<v Speaker 1>to make it understandable to me.</v>

78
00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:22.083
<v Speaker 1>And I think I do the same unconsciously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's what makes us speakers of the </v>

79
00:04:25.661 --> 00:04:27.190
<v Speaker 1>same language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fact that we,</v>

80
00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:28.323
<v Speaker 1>we blend our variety of speech with that</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sam written standard and that's what </v>

81
00:04:31.361 --> 00:04:33.550
<v Speaker 1>helps us to communicate across day </v>
<v Speaker 1>Alexa.</v>

82
00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:34.443
<v Speaker 1>Now the one weakness in this criteria </v>
<v Speaker 1>and is that there are people who can't </v>

83
00:04:38.501 --> 00:04:41.290
<v Speaker 1>really speak to the standard language </v>
<v Speaker 1>that well.</v>

84
00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:42.513
<v Speaker 1>So that's true in English.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have some people who are uneducated </v>

85
00:04:44.391 --> 00:04:46.390
<v Speaker 1>and maybe they're poor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe high school dropouts,</v>

86
00:04:46.391 --> 00:04:49.750
<v Speaker 1>maybe they're the type of people who </v>
<v Speaker 1>just don't really care about studying or</v>

87
00:04:49.751 --> 00:04:50.584
<v Speaker 1>speaking properly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't really know the standard </v>

88
00:04:52.091 --> 00:04:53.620
<v Speaker 1>language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They might understand it,</v>

89
00:04:53.621 --> 00:04:54.454
<v Speaker 1>but they can't speak like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So are those speakers have the same </v>

90
00:04:56.981 --> 00:04:57.814
<v Speaker 1>language even though they don't really </v>
<v Speaker 1>know how to use the standard written </v>

91
00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:03.580
<v Speaker 1>language properly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's kind of the trouble with,</v>

92
00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:04.900
<v Speaker 1>with that criterion.</v>

93
00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:05.763
<v Speaker 1>But so far that's the best criteria that</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've found to explain what is a dialect </v>

94
00:05:10.031 --> 00:05:13.420
<v Speaker 1>and what's a language that written </v>
<v Speaker 1>common standard language.</v>

95
00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:14.553
<v Speaker 1>Now as with all things in life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the situation gets just messy when we </v>

96
00:05:17.771 --> 00:05:20.950
<v Speaker 1>bring politics into it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because sometimes we have a,</v>

97
00:05:20.951 --> 00:05:24.700
<v Speaker 1>we have two varieties of language that </v>
<v Speaker 1>are almost exactly the same,</v>

98
00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:25.683
<v Speaker 1>but they have two different names in two</v>
<v Speaker 1>different countries or their spoken by </v>

99
00:05:28.721 --> 00:05:32.230
<v Speaker 1>two different ethnic groups and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>both clem that language as their own.</v>

100
00:05:32.231 --> 00:05:35.440
<v Speaker 1>So they call it by different names and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it causes a lot of weird confusion.</v>

101
00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:36.603
<v Speaker 1>So I've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's like that in the former </v>

102
00:05:38.141 --> 00:05:40.080
<v Speaker 1>Yugoslavia for some of the languages </v>
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

103
00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:44.140
<v Speaker 1>there are people who just don't want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be associated with the other people.</v>

104
00:05:44.141 --> 00:05:44.974
<v Speaker 1>So they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they called the language by the name of </v>

105
00:05:46.241 --> 00:05:49.300
<v Speaker 1>their own ethnic group,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though it's the Sam as the language</v>

106
00:05:49.301 --> 00:05:50.800
<v Speaker 1>of another ethnic group basically.</v>

107
00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:52.113
<v Speaker 1>So even though the standard written </v>
<v Speaker 1>language might be pretty much the Sam </v>

108
00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:57.010
<v Speaker 1>might be slightly different,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's pretty much the,</v>

109
00:05:57.650 --> 00:05:59.780
<v Speaker 1>and the spoken language is pretty much </v>
<v Speaker 1>the same.</v>

110
00:05:59.781 --> 00:06:02.780
<v Speaker 1>Maybe with some variation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're mutually intelligible.</v>

111
00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:06.080
<v Speaker 1>Even the standard written languages </v>
<v Speaker 1>mutually intelligible,</v>

112
00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:10.010
<v Speaker 1>but they call it a different language </v>
<v Speaker 1>because of whack ass politics.</v>

113
00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:12.230
<v Speaker 1>I don't like politics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a political person.</v>

114
00:06:12.231 --> 00:06:14.690
<v Speaker 1>I'm more interested in cultures and in </v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

115
00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:18.170
<v Speaker 1>so I don't really buy that definition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't like it when people say we speak</v>

116
00:06:18.171 --> 00:06:19.004
<v Speaker 1>a different language because we have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>different ethnic group at different </v>

117
00:06:21.681 --> 00:06:24.290
<v Speaker 1>nationality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to call this language hours.</v>

118
00:06:24.291 --> 00:06:25.460
<v Speaker 1>It's not yours,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's ours.</v>

119
00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:26.623
<v Speaker 1>I don't really like that kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>territorial claiming of languages so I </v>

120
00:06:29.361 --> 00:06:30.194
<v Speaker 1>don't buy this definition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think if you can speak together with </v>

121
00:06:33.531 --> 00:06:35.180
<v Speaker 1>each other and it's mutually </v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligible,</v>

122
00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:36.320
<v Speaker 1>you can read the same books.</v>

123
00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:38.960
<v Speaker 1>Then in my opinion you're speaking the </v>
<v Speaker 1>same language.</v>

124
00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:39.823
<v Speaker 1>I don't really buy the political </v>
<v Speaker 1>definition of what's the language and </v>

125
00:06:41.931 --> 00:06:42.764
<v Speaker 1>what's a dialect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So basically my definition of a dialect </v>

126
00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:51.290
<v Speaker 1>is that it's mutually comprehensible </v>
<v Speaker 1>with another variety of language.</v>

127
00:06:51.530 --> 00:06:53.900
<v Speaker 1>So if you can communicate with them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they understand you,</v>

128
00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:54.823
<v Speaker 1>you understand them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you can use the written language </v>

129
00:06:57.260 --> 00:07:00.290
<v Speaker 1>elements of the written language to make</v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself even more understood.</v>

130
00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:03.440
<v Speaker 1>Then I think you were speaking dialects </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the same language.</v>

131
00:07:03.530 --> 00:07:04.363
<v Speaker 1>I hope that is helpful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hope that gives you some something to </v>

132
00:07:06.801 --> 00:07:09.110
<v Speaker 1>think about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Leave your comments down below.</v>

133
00:07:09.111 --> 00:07:12.110
<v Speaker 1>Tell me if you agree with my opinion on </v>
<v Speaker 1>this matter.</v>

134
00:07:12.290 --> 00:07:14.750
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is Paul signing off.</v>
