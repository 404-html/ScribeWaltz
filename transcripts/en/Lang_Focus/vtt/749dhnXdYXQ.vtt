3
00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:18.230
<v Speaker 1>Hello everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Welcome to the Lange focus channel.</v>

4
00:00:18.231 --> 00:00:19.270
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my name is Paul.</v>

5
00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:22.850
<v Speaker 1>Today's topic is the Indonesian language</v>
<v Speaker 1>or Bahasa,</v>

6
00:00:22.851 --> 00:00:25.820
<v Speaker 1>Indonesia as it's called in Indonesian </v>
<v Speaker 1>Indonesian,</v>

7
00:00:25.821 --> 00:00:26.654
<v Speaker 1>as closely connected with Malaya.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you haven't seen my video on the </v>

8
00:00:29.301 --> 00:00:30.134
<v Speaker 1>Malay language yet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I recommend that you watch that first </v>

9
00:00:31.911 --> 00:00:35.000
<v Speaker 1>before you watched this video.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Indonesian is based on ballet,</v>

10
00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:38.300
<v Speaker 1>though it has evolved and taken on some </v>
<v Speaker 1>uniquely Indonesian features.</v>

11
00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:39.343
<v Speaker 1>There are about 43 million native </v>
<v Speaker 1>speakers of Indonesian and about </v>

12
00:00:42.021 --> 00:00:45.260
<v Speaker 1>155000002nd language speakers of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Indonesian,</v>

13
00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:46.183
<v Speaker 1>mainly in Indonesia where it's the </v>
<v Speaker 1>national language and the sole official </v>

14
00:00:48.681 --> 00:00:49.514
<v Speaker 1>language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why does Indonesian have so many more </v>

15
00:00:50.961 --> 00:00:53.120
<v Speaker 1>second language speakers than native </v>
<v Speaker 1>speakers?</v>

16
00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:54.043
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are hundreds of languages spoken </v>

17
00:00:55.131 --> 00:00:55.964
<v Speaker 1>in Indonesia and Indonesia and functions</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a Lingua Franca between speakers of </v>

18
00:00:59.031 --> 00:00:59.864
<v Speaker 1>different languages.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the language of education and of </v>

19
00:01:01.701 --> 00:01:04.040
<v Speaker 1>media and these days everybody learns </v>
<v Speaker 1>Indonesian,</v>

20
00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.903
<v Speaker 1>but most Indonesians still speak a </v>
<v Speaker 1>different regional language as their </v>

21
00:01:07.371 --> 00:01:09.110
<v Speaker 1>native language plus Indonesia.</v>

22
00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:11.930
<v Speaker 1>The national language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How was the Indonesian language born?</v>

23
00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.270
<v Speaker 1>Indonesian is based on the Malaya </v>
<v Speaker 1>language,</v>

24
00:01:14.271 --> 00:01:15.104
<v Speaker 1>which has been a Lingua Franca of trade </v>
<v Speaker 1>and of the elite throughout the Malay </v>

25
00:01:17.691 --> 00:01:18.524
<v Speaker 1>archipelago for centuries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The story of Indonesian begins during </v>

26
00:01:21.141 --> 00:01:23.810
<v Speaker 1>the colonial period in the early 17th </v>
<v Speaker 1>century.</v>

27
00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:28.460
<v Speaker 1>The VOC or the Dutch east India company </v>
<v Speaker 1>established a trading post at Batavia.</v>

28
00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:29.383
<v Speaker 1>The site of Present Day Jakarta and over</v>
<v Speaker 1>the following three centuries expanded </v>

29
00:01:32.511 --> 00:01:34.460
<v Speaker 1>into other areas of present day </v>
<v Speaker 1>Indonesia.</v>

30
00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:35.503
<v Speaker 1>The Dutch east India company made Molay </v>
<v Speaker 1>the administrative language of its </v>

31
00:01:37.941 --> 00:01:40.180
<v Speaker 1>trading outpost.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In 1799,</v>

32
00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:41.053
<v Speaker 1>the Dutch east India company went </v>
<v Speaker 1>bankrupt and the Dutch government took </v>

33
00:01:43.491 --> 00:01:46.490
<v Speaker 1>control of the colony in the late 18th </v>
<v Speaker 1>century.</v>

34
00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:50.360
<v Speaker 1>The British east India company had also </v>
<v Speaker 1>arrived in the archipelago and an 18,</v>

35
00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:51.203
<v Speaker 1>24,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a treaty between the British and the </v>

36
00:01:52.401 --> 00:01:53.234
<v Speaker 1>Dutch divided the area between the </v>
<v Speaker 1>British to the north and the Dutch to </v>

37
00:01:55.971 --> 00:01:56.804
<v Speaker 1>the south in the Dutch colony,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the promotion of the Dutch language and </v>

38
00:01:59.301 --> 00:02:02.330
<v Speaker 1>education and Dutch began,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but only to a limited extent,</v>

39
00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:05.390
<v Speaker 1>mostly for the elite compared to other </v>
<v Speaker 1>colonial powers.</v>

40
00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:06.223
<v Speaker 1>The Dutch were not really interested in </v>
<v Speaker 1>changing the culture of the colonized </v>

41
00:02:08.751 --> 00:02:11.450
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Their main goal was to facilitate trade,</v>

42
00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:14.120
<v Speaker 1>therefore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>since Malaya was already a Lingua Franca</v>

43
00:02:14.121 --> 00:02:14.954
<v Speaker 1>that could facilitate trade,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was no reason for them to </v>

44
00:02:16.551 --> 00:02:17.384
<v Speaker 1>introduce Dutch as a Lingua Franca.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Dutch promoted Malaya as the </v>

45
00:02:20.241 --> 00:02:22.950
<v Speaker 1>language of education,</v>
<v Speaker 1>recognizing referral molay,</v>

46
00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.440
<v Speaker 1>the classical Malays spoken in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Malacca and Johor,</v>

47
00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:26.493
<v Speaker 1>nate's as the standard language,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the standard form of Malaya continue to </v>

48
00:02:29.481 --> 00:02:31.570
<v Speaker 1>develop with the abundance of Malaya </v>
<v Speaker 1>literature.</v>

49
00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:34.100
<v Speaker 1>In the 19th century into the 20th </v>
<v Speaker 1>century,</v>

50
00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.963
<v Speaker 1>molay linguists published dictionaries </v>
<v Speaker 1>and grammars to further standardize and </v>

51
00:02:37.641 --> 00:02:38.474
<v Speaker 1>modernize the language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Dutch language never became </v>

52
00:02:40.371 --> 00:02:41.990
<v Speaker 1>widespread in Indonesia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

53
00:02:41.991 --> 00:02:42.824
<v Speaker 1>in 1940,</v>
<v Speaker 1>only two percent of Indonesians spoke </v>

54
00:02:44.841 --> 00:02:45.674
<v Speaker 1>Dutch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but even though the role of the Dutch </v>

55
00:02:46.791 --> 00:02:47.624
<v Speaker 1>language was very limited,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a large number of Dutch loan words </v>

56
00:02:49.821 --> 00:02:52.790
<v Speaker 1>entered the Malay language in the areas </v>
<v Speaker 1>under Dutch control,</v>

57
00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:53.713
<v Speaker 1>and this is one of the things that made </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Indonesian variety of Malaya </v>

58
00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:57.470
<v Speaker 1>different from other varieties.</v>

59
00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:58.423
<v Speaker 1>In the early 20th century,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pro Independence Movement arose and </v>

60
00:03:00.971 --> 00:03:04.870
<v Speaker 1>people throughout the Dutch colony began</v>
<v Speaker 1>to see themselves as a single people,</v>

61
00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:05.823
<v Speaker 1>Indonesians.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The term Indonesia was a new term for </v>

62
00:03:07.691 --> 00:03:10.510
<v Speaker 1>the archipelago created by European </v>
<v Speaker 1>ethnologists,</v>

63
00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:11.373
<v Speaker 1>but adopted by nationalists in the Dutch</v>
<v Speaker 1>colony at the Youth Conference of </v>

64
00:03:13.961 --> 00:03:14.794
<v Speaker 1>Nineteen Twenty eight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Young nationalists declared the youth </v>

65
00:03:16.781 --> 00:03:19.480
<v Speaker 1>pledge with three ideals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one motherland,</v>

66
00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:21.490
<v Speaker 1>one nation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and one language.</v>

67
00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:24.700
<v Speaker 1>The language they chose was the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Indonesian variety of Malaya,</v>

68
00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:26.830
<v Speaker 1>which they named Bahasa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Indonesia.</v>

69
00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:29.800
<v Speaker 1>When Indonesia declared independence in </v>
<v Speaker 1>1945,</v>

70
00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:32.890
<v Speaker 1>Indonesian was declared the national </v>
<v Speaker 1>language of the new country,</v>

71
00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:35.500
<v Speaker 1>but why Indonesian?</v>
<v Speaker 1>At the time of independence,</v>

72
00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:38.920
<v Speaker 1>Indonesian was the native language of </v>
<v Speaker 1>only five percent of the population.</v>

73
00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:42.850
<v Speaker 1>While Japanese was the native language </v>
<v Speaker 1>of over 40 percent of the population.</v>

74
00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:45.970
<v Speaker 1>So why wasn't Japanese chosen to be the </v>
<v Speaker 1>national language?</v>

75
00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:46.953
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that would've shown favoritism to </v>

76
00:03:47.681 --> 00:03:48.514
<v Speaker 1>Indonesia is the largest ethnic group </v>
<v Speaker 1>undermining the national unity of the </v>

77
00:03:51.161 --> 00:03:51.994
<v Speaker 1>country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but Indonesian previously known just as </v>

78
00:03:54.101 --> 00:03:54.934
<v Speaker 1>Molay had been a lingua Franca </v>
<v Speaker 1>throughout the archipelago for </v>

79
00:03:57.101 --> 00:03:57.700
<v Speaker 1>centuries.</v>

80
00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:00.970
<v Speaker 1>So people in various regions of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>country already knew some molay.</v>

81
00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:01.983
<v Speaker 1>It was also a much simpler language than</v>
<v Speaker 1>Japanese and could realistically be </v>

82
00:04:04.631 --> 00:04:06.910
<v Speaker 1>learned by millions of people as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>second language.</v>

83
00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:08.890
<v Speaker 1>Indonesian turned out to be the right </v>
<v Speaker 1>choice,</v>

84
00:04:08.891 --> 00:04:11.890
<v Speaker 1>successfully becoming the language of </v>
<v Speaker 1>government education,</v>

85
00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:15.220
<v Speaker 1>trade and communication between people </v>
<v Speaker 1>in different regions of the country.</v>

86
00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:18.340
<v Speaker 1>Indonesian completely replaced the form </v>
<v Speaker 1>of colonial language,</v>

87
00:04:18.341 --> 00:04:19.174
<v Speaker 1>Dutch as the language of public life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's something that's very rare </v>

88
00:04:21.461 --> 00:04:22.294
<v Speaker 1>and former colonies today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Indonesian is still the second language </v>

89
00:04:24.701 --> 00:04:25.534
<v Speaker 1>of most Indonesian people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's becoming increasingly more </v>

90
00:04:27.611 --> 00:04:30.370
<v Speaker 1>common as a native language,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially in the cities.</v>

91
00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:33.520
<v Speaker 1>That's because people from all over the </v>
<v Speaker 1>country moved to the big cities,</v>

92
00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:34.443
<v Speaker 1>so rather than speak their native </v>
<v Speaker 1>regional languages that they speak </v>

93
00:04:36.431 --> 00:04:37.264
<v Speaker 1>Indonesian instead and some of them get </v>
<v Speaker 1>married with each other and they raised </v>

94
00:04:39.911 --> 00:04:42.820
<v Speaker 1>their children speaking Indonesian as </v>
<v Speaker 1>their primary language.</v>

95
00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:44.860
<v Speaker 1>So what is Indonesian like?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

96
00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:45.753
<v Speaker 1>undoubtedly one of the things that made </v>
<v Speaker 1>Indonesian so successful as a national </v>

97
00:04:48.701 --> 00:04:49.534
<v Speaker 1>language so quickly was it simplicity?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you've seen my video on molay than </v>

98
00:04:52.991 --> 00:04:53.824
<v Speaker 1>you're already familiar with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>simplicity of Indonesian because in its </v>

99
00:04:56.261 --> 00:04:57.094
<v Speaker 1>standard form it's very close to </v>
<v Speaker 1>standard Malai just with some different </v>

100
00:04:59.771 --> 00:05:00.604
<v Speaker 1>vocabulary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here are some features of Indonesian </v>

101
00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:05.500
<v Speaker 1>Indonesian has simple phonology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Orthography in general,</v>

102
00:05:05.501 --> 00:05:06.334
<v Speaker 1>one letter represents just one cell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Indonesian has simple Svo sentence </v>

103
00:05:09.431 --> 00:05:10.264
<v Speaker 1>structure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are no case inflections in </v>

104
00:05:11.471 --> 00:05:13.420
<v Speaker 1>Indonesian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is also no grammatical,</v>

105
00:05:13.421 --> 00:05:14.254
<v Speaker 1>gender and Indonesian.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no plural form and Indonesian </v>

106
00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:18.560
<v Speaker 1>and explicit plurals are made </v>
<v Speaker 1>duplications.</v>

107
00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:19.593
<v Speaker 1>Reduplicate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning that you repeat the word again </v>

108
00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:24.500
<v Speaker 1>and perhaps best of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no verb conjugations.</v>

109
00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:26.083
<v Speaker 1>Let's look at a few Indonesian sentences</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we'll identify some of those </v>

110
00:05:28.401 --> 00:05:29.250
<v Speaker 1>features.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

111
00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.760
<v Speaker 1>This sentence means they are cooking </v>
<v Speaker 1>eggs for breakfast,</v>

112
00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:38.960
<v Speaker 1>word for word it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They now cooked egg for breakfast.</v>

113
00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:42.380
<v Speaker 1>We can see that this sentence is Svo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As I said before,</v>

114
00:05:42.381 --> 00:05:43.214
<v Speaker 1>there are no verb conjugations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so how do we know that this action is </v>

115
00:05:45.501 --> 00:05:46.880
<v Speaker 1>happening now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

116
00:05:46.881 --> 00:05:48.890
<v Speaker 1>it's because of this word right here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sit down.</v>

117
00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:52.280
<v Speaker 1>This is an adverb that indicates that </v>
<v Speaker 1>something is happening right now.</v>

118
00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:55.220
<v Speaker 1>You can change the tense of the verb by </v>
<v Speaker 1>changing this adverb.</v>

119
00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:56.113
<v Speaker 1>Here's another sentence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it goes to the after changing the </v>

120
00:05:59.511 --> 00:06:00.344
<v Speaker 1>word sit down to Suda.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The sentence now means they cooked eggs </v>

121
00:06:02.991 --> 00:06:03.824
<v Speaker 1>for breakfast in the past tense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The adverb Suda means something like </v>

122
00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:09.350
<v Speaker 1>already and shows that an action has </v>
<v Speaker 1>been completed.</v>

123
00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:10.483
<v Speaker 1>How about the future tense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it got kind of a must have to lose </v>

124
00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:15.590
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>ICON is the future adverb.</v>

125
00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:18.500
<v Speaker 1>Another example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>separate.</v>

126
00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:20.030
<v Speaker 1>Discerning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bulibar,</v>

127
00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:20.800
<v Speaker 1>Colombo.</v>

128
00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:21.633
<v Speaker 1>This means like me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he often travels to loan book word for </v>

129
00:06:24.231 --> 00:06:25.720
<v Speaker 1>word.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like I.</v>

130
00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:30.790
<v Speaker 1>He often traveled to loan book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Another example of Tacoma Mall.</v>

131
00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:35.960
<v Speaker 1>Do this means do you want to sit up up </v>
<v Speaker 1>is a yes or a no question marker,</v>

132
00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:39.920
<v Speaker 1>so word for word it's question you want </v>
<v Speaker 1>sit,</v>

133
00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:44.210
<v Speaker 1>but up as often left out in speech and </v>
<v Speaker 1>notice that to express desire.</v>

134
00:06:44.211 --> 00:06:46.760
<v Speaker 1>You can just add my own right before </v>
<v Speaker 1>another verb.</v>

135
00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.100
<v Speaker 1>The second verb doesn't change its form </v>
<v Speaker 1>at all.</v>

136
00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:51.270
<v Speaker 1>Another example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Siama newly.</v>

137
00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:55.460
<v Speaker 1>This means I write letters for my friend</v>
<v Speaker 1>word for word.</v>

138
00:06:55.461 --> 00:06:56.294
<v Speaker 1>It's I write a letter for friend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I noticed that the word for letters </v>

139
00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:04.400
<v Speaker 1>Sudip is the same as the singular form.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Also noticed that possession is shown by</v>

140
00:07:04.401 --> 00:07:07.850
<v Speaker 1>placing a personal pronoun right after </v>
<v Speaker 1>announcing to Mon Cya.</v>

141
00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:10.310
<v Speaker 1>Literally friend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I means my friend.</v>

142
00:07:10.730 --> 00:07:12.740
<v Speaker 1>This makes it quite easy to form </v>
<v Speaker 1>possessives.</v>

143
00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:17.320
<v Speaker 1>Another example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Scientists who come down.</v>

144
00:07:17.810 --> 00:07:18.643
<v Speaker 1>This means,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't like eating peanuts word for </v>

145
00:07:20.391 --> 00:07:20.990
<v Speaker 1>word.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

146
00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:21.823
<v Speaker 1>I know like eat peanut,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we negate a sentence by adding t dot </v>

147
00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:26.533
<v Speaker 1>before the verb,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and notice that similar to the word </v>

148
00:07:28.390 --> 00:07:29.223
<v Speaker 1>mouth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which means once we can express like by </v>

149
00:07:31.041 --> 00:07:35.150
<v Speaker 1>placing the word Sukar right before </v>
<v Speaker 1>another verb got Joan Suda.</v>

150
00:07:36.290 --> 00:07:39.470
<v Speaker 1>This means the peanuts have already been</v>
<v Speaker 1>eaten word by word.</v>

151
00:07:39.471 --> 00:07:43.280
<v Speaker 1>It's peanuts already be eaten.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The icon is a passive.</v>

152
00:07:44.450 --> 00:07:46.910
<v Speaker 1>Let's take a look at some of the verbs </v>
<v Speaker 1>from the above sentences.</v>

153
00:07:47.060 --> 00:07:47.893
<v Speaker 1>You can see that these Indonesian verbs </v>
<v Speaker 1>have two parts of root in black and an </v>

154
00:07:51.531 --> 00:07:55.790
<v Speaker 1>ethics in red Indonesian has many such </v>
<v Speaker 1>affixes that are added to routes to make</v>

155
00:07:55.791 --> 00:07:57.320
<v Speaker 1>verbs and nouns.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One example,</v>

156
00:07:57.321 --> 00:07:58.154
<v Speaker 1>the root Dooley's meaning to right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have to write the two lists to be </v>

157
00:08:03.501 --> 00:08:06.420
<v Speaker 1>written that the police to be written to</v>
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>

158
00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:10.160
<v Speaker 1>something that's written when normally </v>
<v Speaker 1>scan to write something down,</v>

159
00:08:10.340 --> 00:08:14.240
<v Speaker 1>but no lease a writer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but no listen the process of writing,</v>

160
00:08:14.540 --> 00:08:15.373
<v Speaker 1>but at the least to have written on it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the lesson with the writing or </v>

161
00:08:20.271 --> 00:08:21.104
<v Speaker 1>words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can see more examples of such </v>

162
00:08:22.731 --> 00:08:26.510
<v Speaker 1>affixes in my video on Malave,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which functions in the same way affix is</v>

163
00:08:26.511 --> 00:08:28.520
<v Speaker 1>of the most challenging part of learning</v>
<v Speaker 1>Indonesian,</v>

164
00:08:28.580 --> 00:08:29.413
<v Speaker 1>at least for a lot of learners,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can make use of that feature of </v>

165
00:08:31.731 --> 00:08:35.150
<v Speaker 1>the roots and affixes to help you learn </v>
<v Speaker 1>new words through their connections with</v>

166
00:08:35.151 --> 00:08:35.810
<v Speaker 1>other words.</v>

167
00:08:35.810 --> 00:08:39.290
<v Speaker 1>Standard Indonesian really is a simple </v>
<v Speaker 1>language compared to other languages,</v>

168
00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:40.153
<v Speaker 1>but that's standard Indonesia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is normally used as the written </v>

169
00:08:42.741 --> 00:08:43.574
<v Speaker 1>language and informal context.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Way Indonesian is spoken in daily </v>

170
00:08:46.401 --> 00:08:49.040
<v Speaker 1>life is often fairly different from </v>
<v Speaker 1>standard Indonesian,</v>

171
00:08:49.220 --> 00:08:50.053
<v Speaker 1>different varieties of colloquial </v>
<v Speaker 1>Indonesian or spoken around the country </v>

172
00:08:52.550 --> 00:08:55.830
<v Speaker 1>and they're influenced by the local </v>
<v Speaker 1>native language that area,</v>

173
00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:59.420
<v Speaker 1>these different varieties of Indonesian </v>
<v Speaker 1>or referred to as Bahasa gold.</v>

174
00:08:59.610 --> 00:09:02.070
<v Speaker 1>The Bahasa goal of Jakarta is influenced</v>
<v Speaker 1>by Battelle.</v>

175
00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:06.090
<v Speaker 1>We the Malay Creole language that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>native to Jakarta as well as by Javanese</v>

176
00:09:06.091 --> 00:09:06.924
<v Speaker 1>and Sudanese.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Since people from all over Indonesia </v>

177
00:09:08.641 --> 00:09:09.474
<v Speaker 1>moved to Jakarta.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's look at the Bahasa gavel of </v>

178
00:09:11.551 --> 00:09:14.340
<v Speaker 1>Jakarta and see how it differs from </v>
<v Speaker 1>standard Indonesian.</v>

179
00:09:14.610 --> 00:09:19.610
<v Speaker 1>Here's a sentence we looked at before my</v>
<v Speaker 1>name now in Bahasa gold medal.</v>

180
00:09:23.460 --> 00:09:25.560
<v Speaker 1>The first difference we see is that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>word sit down,</v>

181
00:09:25.650 --> 00:09:28.920
<v Speaker 1>which indicates present tense is like in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bahasa gold.</v>

182
00:09:29.070 --> 00:09:32.730
<v Speaker 1>Luggy is also used in standard </v>
<v Speaker 1>Indonesian to me and again or still,</v>

183
00:09:32.940 --> 00:09:35.370
<v Speaker 1>but it's not used as a present tense </v>
<v Speaker 1>marker like this.</v>

184
00:09:35.490 --> 00:09:39.600
<v Speaker 1>Another difference is that the verb is </v>
<v Speaker 1>used in its root form muscle without the</v>

185
00:09:39.601 --> 00:09:40.434
<v Speaker 1>prefix.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then we have a sound difference in the </v>

186
00:09:41.881 --> 00:09:42.714
<v Speaker 1>world to Lord,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which becomes like to lower and then </v>

187
00:09:44.820 --> 00:09:48.270
<v Speaker 1>took becomes bulla which can be used in </v>
<v Speaker 1>standard Indonesian,</v>

188
00:09:48.300 --> 00:09:49.133
<v Speaker 1>but the meaning is more like in order to</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Bahasa got well you can use it to </v>

189
00:09:51.901 --> 00:09:54.250
<v Speaker 1>simply mean for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it got sued.</v>

190
00:09:56.130 --> 00:10:00.170
<v Speaker 1>Now in Bahasa goal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a code here,</v>

191
00:10:00.171 --> 00:10:02.690
<v Speaker 1>notice that the word pseudo is reduced </v>
<v Speaker 1>to Buddha,</v>

192
00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:09.260
<v Speaker 1>but got now in Bahasa gold may come back</v>
<v Speaker 1>and here,</v>

193
00:10:10.830 --> 00:10:13.410
<v Speaker 1>notice that the future marker icon </v>
<v Speaker 1>becomes buckle.</v>

194
00:10:15.030 --> 00:10:19.470
<v Speaker 1>Another example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>separate these setting now in Bahasa.</v>

195
00:10:19.470 --> 00:10:21.130
<v Speaker 1>Goal yet gooey.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

196
00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:22.200
<v Speaker 1>setting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>reboot and Colombo.</v>

197
00:10:22.460 --> 00:10:24.530
<v Speaker 1>The first difference here is that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>word solidity,</v>

198
00:10:24.630 --> 00:10:29.220
<v Speaker 1>meaning like changes to Kayak.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then notice that sale becomes Gui,</v>

199
00:10:29.460 --> 00:10:30.293
<v Speaker 1>which is a lone word from battalion in </v>
<v Speaker 1>beverly becomes the boot on the root is </v>

200
00:10:33.511 --> 00:10:35.190
<v Speaker 1>the same,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the graphics are different.</v>

201
00:10:36.100 --> 00:10:39.840
<v Speaker 1>Do in this example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll see two variations of Bahasa gold.</v>

202
00:10:40.050 --> 00:10:40.883
<v Speaker 1>The first variation is a simple casual </v>
<v Speaker 1>sentence going to duke that notice that </v>

203
00:10:44.611 --> 00:10:47.040
<v Speaker 1>the yes or no question marker isn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

204
00:10:47.190 --> 00:10:50.770
<v Speaker 1>Instead at the end you see God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which means no in Bahasa Dell,</v>

205
00:10:51.300 --> 00:10:53.280
<v Speaker 1>so it's like you want to sit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

206
00:10:53.670 --> 00:10:54.503
<v Speaker 1>The second variation is used for close </v>
<v Speaker 1>friends or people the same age as you </v>

207
00:10:57.151 --> 00:10:58.340
<v Speaker 1>are younger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lumada,</v>

208
00:10:58.460 --> 00:11:00.930
<v Speaker 1>loopnet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The second person Pronoun is loop,</v>

209
00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:03.240
<v Speaker 1>which I believe is a lone word from </v>
<v Speaker 1>Chinese,</v>

210
00:11:03.241 --> 00:11:06.270
<v Speaker 1>which is present in the battalion we </v>
<v Speaker 1>creole language of Jakarta.</v>

211
00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:08.093
<v Speaker 1>In this example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's look at some options for first </v>

212
00:11:09.811 --> 00:11:10.644
<v Speaker 1>person pronouns.</v>

213
00:11:11.070 --> 00:11:16.070
<v Speaker 1>Siama men who weren't really suited what</v>
<v Speaker 1>the manway in a casual,</v>

214
00:11:19.980 --> 00:11:24.120
<v Speaker 1>polite sentence you use,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even in Bahasa gold in a more casual,</v>

215
00:11:24.121 --> 00:11:25.980
<v Speaker 1>familiar sentence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>aclu is used,</v>

216
00:11:26.070 --> 00:11:26.903
<v Speaker 1>and when who is used as a possessive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a shortened form is attached to the end </v>

217
00:11:29.940 --> 00:11:33.510
<v Speaker 1>of the Nell in a more intimate sentence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>grew up or way is used,</v>

218
00:11:33.630 --> 00:11:36.180
<v Speaker 1>also noticed that monopolies loses its </v>
<v Speaker 1>prefix,</v>

219
00:11:36.330 --> 00:11:38.700
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't revert to its root form </v>
<v Speaker 1>to lease.</v>

220
00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:39.713
<v Speaker 1>Instead,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it maintains the nasal sound at the </v>

221
00:11:40.801 --> 00:11:41.634
<v Speaker 1>beginning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One more small difference we can see is </v>

222
00:11:43.381 --> 00:11:48.270
<v Speaker 1>that the word for friend to mine is </v>
<v Speaker 1>pronounced more like two men and another</v>

223
00:11:48.271 --> 00:11:49.104
<v Speaker 1>example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Scientists who come now in Bahasa gold </v>

224
00:11:52.630 --> 00:11:53.463
<v Speaker 1>item and Kutchan again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here we see the pronouns blew up and we </v>

225
00:11:56.801 --> 00:11:59.540
<v Speaker 1>see that the negative to that becomes </v>
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>

226
00:11:59.770 --> 00:12:02.740
<v Speaker 1>which is related to the word God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which we saw before,</v>

227
00:12:03.010 --> 00:12:06.350
<v Speaker 1>and in Bahasa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>golden Sukkah sometimes becomes the men.</v>

228
00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:12.120
<v Speaker 1>And one last example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now in Bahasa goal here,</v>

229
00:12:13.331 --> 00:12:16.930
<v Speaker 1>the only difference is that [inaudible] </v>
<v Speaker 1>becomes Buddha as we saw before.</v>

230
00:12:18.040 --> 00:12:18.873
<v Speaker 1>So you can see that the colloquial </v>
