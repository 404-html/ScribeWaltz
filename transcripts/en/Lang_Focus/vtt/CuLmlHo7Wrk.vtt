00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:01.163
<v Speaker 1>Hello everyone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>welcome to the Lange Focus Channel and </v>

2
00:00:03.181 --> 00:00:04.014
<v Speaker 1>my name is Paul.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Today's topic is the Java language as </v>

3
00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:09.030
<v Speaker 1>Spanish creole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

4
00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:11.910
<v Speaker 1>the only Spanish based Creole language </v>
<v Speaker 1>in Asia.</v>

5
00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.280
<v Speaker 1>The name of the language comes from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Spanish word Shabacado,</v>

6
00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:16.463
<v Speaker 1>meaning vulgar or in poor taste.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's because [inaudible] was </v>

7
00:00:19.381 --> 00:00:22.020
<v Speaker 1>originally considered incorrect or </v>
<v Speaker 1>corrupted.</v>

8
00:00:22.021 --> 00:00:22.854
<v Speaker 1>Spanish Java Condo is spoken in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Philippines and as a direct result of </v>

9
00:00:26.851 --> 00:00:29.130
<v Speaker 1>the Philippines history as a Spanish </v>
<v Speaker 1>colony.</v>

10
00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.800
<v Speaker 1>It's not spoken by the majority of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Filipinos,</v>

11
00:00:31.801 --> 00:00:34.530
<v Speaker 1>but by a minority living in specific </v>
<v Speaker 1>areas.</v>

12
00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.620
<v Speaker 1>It spoken in different varieties in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Cavita,</v>

13
00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.710
<v Speaker 1>a province just south of Metro Manila in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cotabato on the island of Mindanao,</v>

14
00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:47.700
<v Speaker 1>Basilan island to the south of Mindanao,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's spoken by the largest number of</v>

15
00:00:47.701 --> 00:00:48.534
<v Speaker 1>speakers in Zamboanga,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially in Zamboanga City on </v>

16
00:00:51.361 --> 00:00:52.194
<v Speaker 1>Mindanao.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's notoriously difficult to find </v>

17
00:00:54.331 --> 00:00:57.570
<v Speaker 1>consistent statistics about the number </v>
<v Speaker 1>of Java speakers,</v>

18
00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.830
<v Speaker 1>but according to the United Nations </v>
<v Speaker 1>statistics division in 2005,</v>

19
00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.860
<v Speaker 1>there were 431,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>native speakers,</v>

20
00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.280
<v Speaker 1>including around 311,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Zamboanga.</v>

21
00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.820
<v Speaker 1>But those numbers underestimate the </v>
<v Speaker 1>number of people who speak Java.</v>

22
00:01:11.821 --> 00:01:12.654
<v Speaker 1>Condo zone belonged to a city,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a city with over a million people is a </v>

23
00:01:15.631 --> 00:01:19.320
<v Speaker 1>very diverse place with migrants from </v>
<v Speaker 1>all over the Philippines and Java.</v>

24
00:01:19.321 --> 00:01:21.780
<v Speaker 1>Camo serves as the most common Lingua </v>
<v Speaker 1>Franca.</v>

25
00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.620
<v Speaker 1>So hundreds of thousands more people </v>
<v Speaker 1>speak it as a second or third language.</v>

26
00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:27.960
<v Speaker 1>So what is it exactly?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it Spanish?</v>

27
00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:29.220
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not exactly.</v>

28
00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:30.083
<v Speaker 1>It's a Spanish based creole,</v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning that Spanish is the lexus fire </v>

29
00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:33.803
<v Speaker 1>language,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the language that supplied most of the </v>

30
00:01:35.191 --> 00:01:39.270
<v Speaker 1>vocabulary while the grammar is largely </v>
<v Speaker 1>based on Filipino languages,</v>

31
00:01:39.271 --> 00:01:43.560
<v Speaker 1>like the science to catalog and guy </v>
<v Speaker 1>known the Spanish colonial period.</v>

32
00:01:43.561 --> 00:01:47.130
<v Speaker 1>And the Philippines began in 15,</v>
<v Speaker 1>21 and beginning in 15,</v>

33
00:01:47.131 --> 00:01:47.964
<v Speaker 1>65,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Philippine islands began to be </v>

34
00:01:49.621 --> 00:01:52.350
<v Speaker 1>administered from the vice royalty of </v>
<v Speaker 1>new Spain,</v>

35
00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:53.273
<v Speaker 1>which was based in Mexico City.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This continued until Mexico's </v>

36
00:01:56.071 --> 00:01:56.904
<v Speaker 1>independence in 18,</v>
<v Speaker 1>21 after which the Philippines were </v>

37
00:01:59.491 --> 00:02:03.750
<v Speaker 1>administered directly by Spain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but for those 256 years,</v>

38
00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:04.613
<v Speaker 1>Philippines had significant interaction </v>
<v Speaker 1>with new Spain and it's people during </v>

39
00:02:07.981 --> 00:02:09.870
<v Speaker 1>this time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Philippines and new Spain.</v>

40
00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:14.460
<v Speaker 1>We're connected by the galleon trade,</v>
<v Speaker 1>large trading ship voyages that made the</v>

41
00:02:14.461 --> 00:02:17.760
<v Speaker 1>journey between Manila Acapulco once or </v>
<v Speaker 1>twice a year.</v>

42
00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:19.093
<v Speaker 1>This brought Filipinos in contact with </v>
<v Speaker 1>Spanish speaking workers from new Spain </v>

43
00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:25.380
<v Speaker 1>while soldiers and settlers from Spain </v>
<v Speaker 1>were present.</v>

44
00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:29.160
<v Speaker 1>Soldiers and settlers from new span also</v>
<v Speaker 1>arrived in significant numbers.</v>

45
00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:30.233
<v Speaker 1>One place where many newcomers settled </v>
<v Speaker 1>wasn't assemble under which the Spanish </v>

46
00:02:33.271 --> 00:02:34.104
<v Speaker 1>seized in 16,</v>
<v Speaker 1>35 in an attempt to stop attacks by </v>

47
00:02:36.691 --> 00:02:37.524
<v Speaker 1>morrow pirates,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they established a fortress called at a </v>

48
00:02:40.131 --> 00:02:43.710
<v Speaker 1>Alpharetta.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They San Jose Royal Court of St Joseph.</v>

49
00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:48.330
<v Speaker 1>The population of this fort had a direct</v>
<v Speaker 1>impact on the development of the avocado</v>

50
00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:51.870
<v Speaker 1>spoken in Zamboanga.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There were Visayan warriors from say boo</v>

51
00:02:51.871 --> 00:02:54.000
<v Speaker 1>and other areas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Spanish soldiers,</v>

52
00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:56.070
<v Speaker 1>including those from Spain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mexico,</v>

53
00:02:56.071 --> 00:02:56.904
<v Speaker 1>as well as Peru and Jesuit priests who </v>
<v Speaker 1>served Spanish translators and might </v>

54
00:03:01.481 --> 00:03:03.340
<v Speaker 1>have taught the others how to </v>
<v Speaker 1>communicate,</v>

55
00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:07.030
<v Speaker 1>resulting in a pigeon language that </v>
<v Speaker 1>would become the travel condo creole.</v>

56
00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:08.343
<v Speaker 1>This fort was eventually abandoned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but some of the population remained and </v>

57
00:03:11.471 --> 00:03:12.304
<v Speaker 1>continued to interact with locals while </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Jesuit priests continued their </v>

58
00:03:15.311 --> 00:03:16.144
<v Speaker 1>conversion efforts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This both spread Java condo and brought </v>

59
00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:19.713
<v Speaker 1>additional influences to the language </v>
<v Speaker 1>making it a little more Filipino and a </v>

60
00:03:22.841 --> 00:03:23.674
<v Speaker 1>little less Spanish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the kind of contact that </v>

61
00:03:25.721 --> 00:03:28.930
<v Speaker 1>resulted in the creation of other forms </v>
<v Speaker 1>of Java condo as well,</v>

62
00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:31.270
<v Speaker 1>but the exact influences were somewhat </v>
<v Speaker 1>different.</v>

63
00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:34.360
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Java condo spoken and covey tape has</v>

64
00:03:34.361 --> 00:03:35.194
<v Speaker 1>more Castilian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Spanish influence and less Mexican </v>

65
00:03:37.061 --> 00:03:40.990
<v Speaker 1>Spanish influence and has more Tagalog </v>
<v Speaker 1>influence rather than be cited.</v>

66
00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:42.303
<v Speaker 1>Now let's look at some features of </v>
<v Speaker 1>avocado and see how it differs from </v>

67
00:03:44.801 --> 00:03:47.800
<v Speaker 1>Spanish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm focusing mainly on Zumba on Daniel,</v>

68
00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:50.260
<v Speaker 1>that Java condo creole spoken in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Zamboanga.</v>

69
00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:51.813
<v Speaker 1>We'll start by focusing on the syntax </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'll introduce additional elements </v>

70
00:03:54.911 --> 00:03:58.150
<v Speaker 1>as we go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While Spanish is generally Svo,</v>

71
00:03:58.420 --> 00:03:59.253
<v Speaker 1>Java,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Camo is generally vso like Tagalo or </v>

72
00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:02.423
<v Speaker 1>resign.</v>

73
00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:03.693
<v Speaker 1>Here's the sentence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning the men looked at Jose in </v>

74
00:04:06.101 --> 00:04:09.700
<v Speaker 1>Spanish in middle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and in Java,</v>

75
00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:14.710
<v Speaker 1>O'connell in Spanish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the subject alone comes first,</v>

76
00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:19.090
<v Speaker 1>but in Java condo it comes after the </v>
<v Speaker 1>verb.</v>

77
00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:22.720
<v Speaker 1>There are some other important things we</v>
<v Speaker 1>can notice about the sentence.</v>

78
00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:24.063
<v Speaker 1>The verb,</v>
<v Speaker 1>middle from Merdod means look in </v>

79
00:04:26.891 --> 00:04:27.724
<v Speaker 1>Spanish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>while in Java it means both look and </v>

80
00:04:29.831 --> 00:04:32.470
<v Speaker 1>see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so depending on the intended meaning,</v>

81
00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:33.333
<v Speaker 1>the Spanish translation might be </v>
<v Speaker 1>elluminate br plus a using a different </v>

82
00:04:37.091 --> 00:04:38.110
<v Speaker 1>verb to mean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

83
00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:41.110
<v Speaker 1>also notice that the verb forms are </v>
<v Speaker 1>slightly different.</v>

84
00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:43.900
<v Speaker 1>The Spanish verb is conjugated for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>third person,</v>

85
00:04:43.901 --> 00:04:47.560
<v Speaker 1>singular conjugation in the Predator it </v>
<v Speaker 1>or past historic tents,</v>

86
00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:50.290
<v Speaker 1>but Java Kennel verbs are conjugated at </v>
<v Speaker 1>all.</v>

87
00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:51.273
<v Speaker 1>The verb.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Madonna will be the same for any </v>

88
00:04:53.021 --> 00:04:53.854
<v Speaker 1>subject.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The only thing that can change is this </v>

89
00:04:55.751 --> 00:04:59.290
<v Speaker 1>extra little piece right here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a proverb that shows tents.</v>

90
00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:01.810
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>indicates past top,</v>

91
00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:05.050
<v Speaker 1>indicates present,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I indicates future.</v>

92
00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:09.100
<v Speaker 1>These are not always used but can be </v>
<v Speaker 1>used for clarity and for emphasis.</v>

93
00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:12.310
<v Speaker 1>Also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>notice that Java condo uses Khan instead</v>

94
00:05:12.311 --> 00:05:15.580
<v Speaker 1>of our column,</v>
<v Speaker 1>comes from the Spanish word con,</v>

95
00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:16.473
<v Speaker 1>meaning with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in Java Kunle it's used as the </v>

96
00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:19.353
<v Speaker 1>object or accusative marker,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so already we can see a number of </v>

97
00:05:22.451 --> 00:05:24.490
<v Speaker 1>differences between Spanish and Chava </v>
<v Speaker 1>condo.</v>

98
00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:27.730
<v Speaker 1>Another example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's a sentence,</v>

99
00:05:27.731 --> 00:05:31.240
<v Speaker 1>meaning you teach children,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you being the plural form.</v>

100
00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:32.553
<v Speaker 1>In Spanish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll status and Nina's and in Java </v>

101
00:05:35.801 --> 00:05:39.880
<v Speaker 1>connell the insignia that again in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Spanish,</v>

102
00:05:39.881 --> 00:05:42.170
<v Speaker 1>the subject comes first and the Java </v>
<v Speaker 1>condo.</v>

103
00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:45.720
<v Speaker 1>It comes after the verb and you'll </v>
<v Speaker 1>notice the present tense verb,</v>

104
00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:46.593
<v Speaker 1>top before the verb now is a locomotive </v>
<v Speaker 1>particle or preposition which shows </v>

105
00:05:50.501 --> 00:05:54.790
<v Speaker 1>direction or location.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Apparently it comes from a historian and</v>

106
00:05:54.791 --> 00:05:55.624
<v Speaker 1>note the difference in vocabulary for </v>
<v Speaker 1>the words meaning children in Java </v>

107
00:05:58.450 --> 00:05:59.283
<v Speaker 1>Kunle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll see the phrase Monga Manga is a </v>

108
00:06:01.521 --> 00:06:02.354
<v Speaker 1>plural marker found in Tagalo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Visayan and Haley Guy Known in Java </v>

109
00:06:05.461 --> 00:06:05.780
<v Speaker 1>candle.</v>

110
00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:06.613
<v Speaker 1>This is sometimes used as the plural </v>
<v Speaker 1>marker and the Spanish plural form with </v>

111
00:06:09.321 --> 00:06:12.830
<v Speaker 1>s or s is sometimes used.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Another example.</v>

112
00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:13.813
<v Speaker 1>Here's the sentence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning I love you in Spanish or the </v>

113
00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:22.380
<v Speaker 1>ammo and the Java Kunle on my ego or </v>
<v Speaker 1>that my yield,</v>

114
00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:26.300
<v Speaker 1>but indego this time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Spanish sentence is Sov,</v>

115
00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:29.300
<v Speaker 1>not Svo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because when the object is a pronoun,</v>

116
00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:32.030
<v Speaker 1>it usually comes before the verb,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in Spanish,</v>

117
00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:32.893
<v Speaker 1>the subject pronouns can be dropped </v>
<v Speaker 1>because the person in number are clear </v>

118
00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:37.910
<v Speaker 1>from the conjugation of the verb.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In Java,</v>

119
00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:40.040
<v Speaker 1>however,</v>
<v Speaker 1>verbs are conjugated,</v>

120
00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:44.870
<v Speaker 1>so the subject Pronoun is necessary and </v>
<v Speaker 1>notice that the top is optional.</v>

121
00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:46.153
<v Speaker 1>Earlier we saw that cone meaning with in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Spanish is used as the object marker in </v>

122
00:06:50.021 --> 00:06:52.460
<v Speaker 1>Java candle here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Contigo,</v>

123
00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:56.330
<v Speaker 1>which means with you in Spanish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is used as the object Pronoun.</v>

124
00:06:56.840 --> 00:07:01.130
<v Speaker 1>All of the subject pronouns of Spanish </v>
<v Speaker 1>origin have an object pronoun equivalent</v>

125
00:07:01.131 --> 00:07:02.780
<v Speaker 1>like this that begins with colon.</v>

126
00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:03.763
<v Speaker 1>There are other subject pronouns of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Filipino origin and their corresponding </v>

127
00:07:06.471 --> 00:07:08.930
<v Speaker 1>object.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pronouns are also a Filipino origin.</v>

128
00:07:09.290 --> 00:07:10.123
<v Speaker 1>Some pronouns might come from Filipino </v>
<v Speaker 1>languages because they communicate </v>

129
00:07:12.861 --> 00:07:15.470
<v Speaker 1>something that the Spanish pronouns </v>
<v Speaker 1>couldn't communicate.</v>

130
00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:16.580
<v Speaker 1>Notice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

131
00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:19.880
<v Speaker 1>the first person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>plural pronouns come in and Kita,</v>

132
00:07:20.030 --> 00:07:22.760
<v Speaker 1>which come from Visayan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some Austronesian languages,</v>

133
00:07:22.790 --> 00:07:24.800
<v Speaker 1>including some languages of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Philippines.</v>

134
00:07:24.801 --> 00:07:27.050
<v Speaker 1>Distinguished between the first person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>plural,</v>

135
00:07:27.110 --> 00:07:30.170
<v Speaker 1>inclusive of the listener and exclusive </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the listener.</v>

136
00:07:31.310 --> 00:07:32.900
<v Speaker 1>Another example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's a sentence,</v>

137
00:07:32.901 --> 00:07:35.420
<v Speaker 1>meaning this is Pablo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In Spanish,</v>

138
00:07:35.730 --> 00:07:40.730
<v Speaker 1>it's the low and in Java candle again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Spanish,</v>

139
00:07:41.391 --> 00:07:44.330
<v Speaker 1>the subject comes first.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the demonstrative Pronoun.</v>

140
00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:45.313
<v Speaker 1>Sdi.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In Chicago it comes after the predicate </v>

141
00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:49.880
<v Speaker 1>and you can see that the pronoun is </v>
<v Speaker 1>abbreviated,</v>

142
00:07:49.910 --> 00:07:50.743
<v Speaker 1>but it's not always so there's actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>no verb in this sentence because Java </v>

143
00:07:53.660 --> 00:07:54.493
<v Speaker 1>condo has no copy Copula,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the word order is really predicate </v>

144
00:07:57.140 --> 00:07:57.973
<v Speaker 1>subject.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The word see is a subject marker for </v>

145
00:07:59.931 --> 00:08:00.764
<v Speaker 1>personal names,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is also found in Tagalog and </v>

146
00:08:03.021 --> 00:08:05.540
<v Speaker 1>healy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>guy known in Spanish.</v>

147
00:08:05.570 --> 00:08:06.403
<v Speaker 1>Demonstrative pronouns have gender,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but Java cundall has no grammatical </v>

148
00:08:09.351 --> 00:08:12.020
<v Speaker 1>gender.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for a female name in Spanish it would</v>

149
00:08:12.021 --> 00:08:15.920
<v Speaker 1>be like this is that is Trisha with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>change in the pronouns.</v>

150
00:08:16.110 --> 00:08:16.943
<v Speaker 1>While then Sheva Condo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would be this with no change in the </v>

151
00:08:20.781 --> 00:08:21.614
<v Speaker 1>Pronoun and other elements of the world </v>
<v Speaker 1>order that is different is that </v>

152
00:08:24.681 --> 00:08:26.930
<v Speaker 1>adjectives come before nouns.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In Java candle,</v>

153
00:08:26.990 --> 00:08:27.823
<v Speaker 1>not after.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In Spanish we have limited meaning free </v>

154
00:08:31.071 --> 00:08:36.071
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and in Java we have another sentence.</v>

155
00:08:37.220 --> 00:08:40.430
<v Speaker 1>Here's the sentence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning I love their house in Spanish,</v>

156
00:08:40.570 --> 00:08:45.570
<v Speaker 1>you almost,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and in Java Kunle again,</v>

157
00:08:47.331 --> 00:08:50.360
<v Speaker 1>notice that in the Spanish sentence you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can drop the subject,</v>

158
00:08:50.420 --> 00:08:52.940
<v Speaker 1>but in Java condo you can't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The third person,</v>

159
00:08:52.941 --> 00:08:56.220
<v Speaker 1>plural,</v>
<v Speaker 1>possessive pronoun in Java is de la.</v>

160
00:08:56.700 --> 00:08:57.533
<v Speaker 1>The possessive pronouns typically </v>
<v Speaker 1>consist of d prefix to the beginning of </v>

161
00:09:00.841 --> 00:09:02.310
<v Speaker 1>the Spanish subject,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pronouns,</v>

162
00:09:02.490 --> 00:09:05.820
<v Speaker 1>or to Filipino clinic pronouns.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Another sentence,</v>

163
00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:06.713
<v Speaker 1>here's the sentence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning Helena or Jane bought a second </v>

164
00:09:09.211 --> 00:09:10.800
<v Speaker 1>dog in Spanish.</v>

165
00:09:10.910 --> 00:09:15.480
<v Speaker 1>Why not?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in Java one pro one,</v>

166
00:09:15.650 --> 00:09:17.580
<v Speaker 1>you've got those battle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>

167
00:09:17.581 --> 00:09:18.414
<v Speaker 1>we see the SVO versus vsl.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We see the subject Marker C and a pre </v>

168
00:09:22.591 --> 00:09:25.590
<v Speaker 1>verb in Java Condo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we see the word for dog.</v>

169
00:09:26.010 --> 00:09:26.843
<v Speaker 1>There's one new thing to notice here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The ordinal numbers in Spanish is </v>

170
00:09:29.730 --> 00:09:32.170
<v Speaker 1>Segundo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in Java condo it's eco dose.</v>

171
00:09:32.310 --> 00:09:36.510
<v Speaker 1>The cardinal numbers of Java Convo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like those are all basically the same as</v>

172
00:09:36.511 --> 00:09:38.640
<v Speaker 1>in Spanish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but with slightly different spelling,</v>

173
00:09:39.030 --> 00:09:41.880
<v Speaker 1>but while Spanish has different forms </v>
<v Speaker 1>for ordinal numbers,</v>

174
00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:43.470
<v Speaker 1>Shavano,</v>
<v Speaker 1>prefixes,</v>

175
00:09:43.530 --> 00:09:44.363
<v Speaker 1>eco to cardinal numbers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>notice that the Spanish ordinal number </v>

176
00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:48.793
<v Speaker 1>pretty metal is used,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and other Spanish ones can be used in </v>

177
00:09:51.391 --> 00:09:53.610
<v Speaker 1>place of the Cheva Council forums to </v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

178
00:09:53.611 --> 00:09:54.444
<v Speaker 1>good window for example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now let's look at a couple more </v>

179
00:09:57.031 --> 00:09:59.430
<v Speaker 1>sentences and see what we find.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's the sentence,</v>

180
00:09:59.431 --> 00:10:04.260
<v Speaker 1>meaning the book will be published in </v>
<v Speaker 1>five languages in Spanish and thinker,</v>

181
00:10:04.890 --> 00:10:05.723
<v Speaker 1>the almost word for word,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the book will be published in five </v>

182
00:10:10.410 --> 00:10:15.410
<v Speaker 1>languages,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and in Java Kunle word for word,</v>

183
00:10:16.171 --> 00:10:20.700
<v Speaker 1>it's the book verbal prefix come out in </v>
<v Speaker 1>five language.</v>

184
00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:21.833
<v Speaker 1>In this sentence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we see that the subject comes first in </v>

185
00:10:23.641 --> 00:10:25.130
<v Speaker 1>both sentences,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Java,</v>

186
00:10:25.131 --> 00:10:26.100
<v Speaker 1>Connell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Svo,</v>

187
00:10:26.101 --> 00:10:28.230
<v Speaker 1>word order is possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

188
00:10:28.231 --> 00:10:29.064
<v Speaker 1>it's often found a new stories that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>translated from Spanish media keeping </v>

189
00:10:32.311 --> 00:10:35.010
<v Speaker 1>the text as similar to the Spanish </v>
<v Speaker 1>version as possible.</v>

190
00:10:35.910 --> 00:10:38.850
<v Speaker 1>Another thing is that in Chicago there's</v>
<v Speaker 1>no passive form,</v>

191
00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:43.350
<v Speaker 1>so passive meaning is understood from </v>
<v Speaker 1>context or the action can be paraphrased</v>

192
00:10:44.190 --> 00:10:46.890
<v Speaker 1>in Spanish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The sentence is explicitly future,</v>

193
00:10:46.950 --> 00:10:51.390
<v Speaker 1>but the traveler Kennel sentence doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>have the future Prevar I it can have it,</v>

194
00:10:51.391 --> 00:10:52.224
<v Speaker 1>but here it doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We see here that the verb is proceeded </v>

195
00:10:54.721 --> 00:10:55.554
<v Speaker 1>by mom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mom is a prefix that makes a verb </v>

196
00:10:57.980 --> 00:10:58.813
<v Speaker 1>distributive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning that the action is performed by </v>

197
00:11:00.991 --> 00:11:04.170
<v Speaker 1>several subjects or on several objects </v>
<v Speaker 1>separately.</v>

198
00:11:04.410 --> 00:11:05.243
<v Speaker 1>Here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the book will be released separately </v>

199
00:11:06.630 --> 00:11:09.090
<v Speaker 1>five different times in five different </v>
<v Speaker 1>versions,</v>

200
00:11:09.270 --> 00:11:10.103
<v Speaker 1>so money is used to show the </v>
<v Speaker 1>distribution of the action among the </v>

201
00:11:13.051 --> 00:11:14.400
<v Speaker 1>different releases of the book.</v>

202
00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:19.320
<v Speaker 1>Mine is also a prefix that can be </v>
<v Speaker 1>attached to nouns and English loan words</v>

203
00:11:19.350 --> 00:11:21.300
<v Speaker 1>to turn them into travel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kennel verbs,</v>

204
00:11:21.780 --> 00:11:23.550
<v Speaker 1>Mung translate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mon Picnic,</v>

205
00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:25.290
<v Speaker 1>Monroe reply,</v>
<v Speaker 1>etc.</v>

206
00:11:25.590 --> 00:11:26.423
<v Speaker 1>There's a similar prefix mug into </v>
<v Speaker 1>kellogg and visayan and notice that the </v>

207
00:11:30.421 --> 00:11:33.410
<v Speaker 1>word for languages in spanish is easy </v>
<v Speaker 1>omas,</v>

208
00:11:33.690 --> 00:11:35.590
<v Speaker 1>while in java condo it's lingala.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

209
00:11:35.910 --> 00:11:36.780
<v Speaker 1>in java,</v>
<v Speaker 1>connell,</v>

210
00:11:36.870 --> 00:11:37.703
<v Speaker 1>and oTher languages of the Philippines,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lingua here is used to refer to </v>

211
00:11:40.501 --> 00:11:41.334
<v Speaker 1>languages that are spoken by communities</v>
<v Speaker 1>of people while in spanish language </v>

212
00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:47.400
<v Speaker 1>refers more to the general concept of </v>
<v Speaker 1>language,</v>

213
00:11:47.550 --> 00:11:50.580
<v Speaker 1>so to refer to a specific human language</v>
<v Speaker 1>and spanish.</v>

214
00:11:50.810 --> 00:11:54.490
<v Speaker 1>Mom is the typical word and one last </v>
<v Speaker 1>sentence.</v>

215
00:11:54.580 --> 00:11:58.240
<v Speaker 1>This sentence means they left without </v>
<v Speaker 1>paying for the drink in spanish,</v>

216
00:11:58.360 --> 00:12:01.110
<v Speaker 1>so if we don't have either word for </v>
<v Speaker 1>word,</v>

217
00:12:01.111 --> 00:12:06.111
<v Speaker 1>it's reflexive particle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They went without pay the drink in java.</v>

218
00:12:07.390 --> 00:12:12.010
<v Speaker 1>Candle light,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but gobbled nana word for word.</v>

219
00:12:12.010 --> 00:12:14.260
<v Speaker 1>It's past tense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pre-verbal leave.</v>

220
00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:18.220
<v Speaker 1>They without pay object marker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Definite article,</v>

221
00:12:18.310 --> 00:12:19.143
<v Speaker 1>alcoholic drink.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This last sentence is fairly different </v>

222
00:12:21.581 --> 00:12:23.470
<v Speaker 1>from it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Spanish equivalent first,</v>

223
00:12:23.560 --> 00:12:25.720
<v Speaker 1>notice that the verbs are different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>in spanish,</v>

224
00:12:25.750 --> 00:12:29.170
<v Speaker 1>we see the reflexive form of the verb.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eod meaning to go.</v>

225
00:12:29.380 --> 00:12:31.480
<v Speaker 1>The reflexive form is used to mean </v>
<v Speaker 1>leave.</v>

226
00:12:31.700 --> 00:12:33.700
<v Speaker 1>Java.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Camo doesn't have this construction,</v>

227
00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:37.150
<v Speaker 1>so another verb has used.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Instead it's a derivative of the spanish</v>

228
00:12:37.151 --> 00:12:39.220
<v Speaker 1>word,</v>
<v Speaker 1>salyer meaning to go out.</v>

229
00:12:39.570 --> 00:12:41.490
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>
<v Speaker 1>la is the third person plural,</v>

230
00:12:41.491 --> 00:12:44.680
<v Speaker 1>subject pronouns,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which comes from tagalog and visayan.</v>

231
00:12:44.920 --> 00:12:47.910
<v Speaker 1>Hawaii is a negative pre verb for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>past tense.</v>

232
00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.780
<v Speaker 1>Cornell is a combination of con,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the object marKer plus l,</v>

233
00:12:51.840 --> 00:12:54.840
<v Speaker 1>the definite article.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Finally we have the word tomato,</v>

234
00:12:54.870 --> 00:12:57.240
<v Speaker 1>which means alcoholic drink in java </v>
<v Speaker 1>candle.</v>

235
00:12:57.330 --> 00:12:58.163
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in spanish it's maybe the java candle </v>

236
00:12:59.851 --> 00:13:03.630
<v Speaker 1>also has a similar word baby,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that is a general word for a drink,</v>

237
00:13:03.690 --> 00:13:05.610
<v Speaker 1>not specifically an alcoholic drink.</v>

238
00:13:06.430 --> 00:13:10.240
<v Speaker 1>Before I mentioned that java was </v>
<v Speaker 1>influenced by mexican spanish,</v>

239
00:13:10.390 --> 00:13:11.223
<v Speaker 1>there was undoubtedly some influence on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the pronunciation of mcconnell in </v>

240
00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:15.093
<v Speaker 1>travel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kennel also contains some vocabulary </v>

241
00:13:16.421 --> 00:13:19.360
<v Speaker 1>that clearly came from mexican spanish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

242
00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:20.313
<v Speaker 1>psychotic meaning grass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is originally a word from now what </v>

243
00:13:23.250 --> 00:13:24.083
<v Speaker 1>to an indigenous language of Mexico.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It entered mexican spanish as a lone </v>

244
00:13:27.311 --> 00:13:30.370
<v Speaker 1>word and then entered jaVa kennel via </v>
<v Speaker 1>mexican spanish.</v>

245
00:13:30.550 --> 00:13:34.870
<v Speaker 1>These words are also from now what'll </v>
<v Speaker 1>John Gay meaning market which comes from</v>

246
00:13:34.990 --> 00:13:35.823
<v Speaker 1>young gay jungle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning monkey from jungle and </v>

247
00:13:39.420 --> 00:13:40.253
<v Speaker 1>commentate meaning sweet potato.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There were other words and expressions </v>

248
00:13:44.190 --> 00:13:45.023
<v Speaker 1>that don't come from the wattle words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but are common to Mexico and maybe have </v>

249
00:13:48.121 --> 00:13:50.580
<v Speaker 1>special usage in Mexico.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In Mexico,</v>

250
00:13:50.610 --> 00:13:51.443
<v Speaker 1>when you want someone to repeat </v>
<v Speaker 1>something because you didn't catch what </v>

251
00:13:53.551 --> 00:13:55.470
<v Speaker 1>they said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you ask monday.</v>

252
00:13:55.980 --> 00:14:00.980
<v Speaker 1>This is also used in java o'connell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I also hear that a lot of swear words or</v>

253
00:14:00.991 --> 00:14:04.200
<v Speaker 1>of specifically mexican origin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'll skip those for now.</v>

254
00:14:04.950 --> 00:14:08.070
<v Speaker 1>So our avocado and spanish mutually </v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligible,</v>

255
00:14:08.130 --> 00:14:09.450
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes and no.</v>

256
00:14:09.660 --> 00:14:14.040
<v Speaker 1>Some java speakers have told me that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they can understand around 60 percent or</v>

257
00:14:14.041 --> 00:14:17.730
<v Speaker 1>more of certain varietieS of spanish in </v>
<v Speaker 1>particular european,</v>

258
00:14:17.731 --> 00:14:18.564
<v Speaker 1>spanish and mexican spanish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this is not necessarily true fOr </v>

259
00:14:21.601 --> 00:14:23.640
<v Speaker 1>spanish speakers who here java </v>
<v Speaker 1>o'connell,</v>

260
00:14:23.820 --> 00:14:24.653
<v Speaker 1>while most java connell speakers are </v>
<v Speaker 1>familiar with the word order of english </v>

261
00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:29.580
<v Speaker 1>and maybe the word order of spanish </v>
<v Speaker 1>itself.</v>

262
00:14:29.820 --> 00:14:33.660
<v Speaker 1>Spanish speakers are generally not </v>
<v Speaker 1>familiar with the word order of filipino</v>

263
00:14:33.661 --> 00:14:37.130
<v Speaker 1>languages like tagalog or scion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so when they hear cheva condo,</v>

264
00:14:37.170 --> 00:14:39.840
<v Speaker 1>they might just hear a mishmash of </v>
<v Speaker 1>spanish words,</v>

265
00:14:39.960 --> 00:14:43.080
<v Speaker 1>but be confused by how they're being put</v>
<v Speaker 1>together in sentences.</v>

266
00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:44.273
<v Speaker 1>This is especially true for informal </v>
<v Speaker 1>travel condo which has more influence </v>

267
00:14:47.191 --> 00:14:51.320
<v Speaker 1>from filipino languages where as formal </v>
<v Speaker 1>travel economy is closer to spanish,</v>

268
00:14:51.590 --> 00:14:54.070
<v Speaker 1>but probably with some basic exposure to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the grammar,</v>

269
00:14:54.110 --> 00:14:56.600
<v Speaker 1>they could improve their comprehension </v>
<v Speaker 1>of it quite quickly.</v>

270
00:14:57.080 --> 00:14:57.913
<v Speaker 1>Some people argue that [inaudible] </v>
<v Speaker 1>really isn't that different from other </v>

271
00:15:00.471 --> 00:15:03.200
<v Speaker 1>filipino languages like to gallo or </v>
<v Speaker 1>scion,</v>

272
00:15:03.380 --> 00:15:06.130
<v Speaker 1>which contain a lot of spanish </v>
<v Speaker 1>vocabulary themselves.</v>

273
00:15:06.310 --> 00:15:07.143
<v Speaker 1>Java condo just has a lot more of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The question of the day for spanish </v>

274
00:15:10.611 --> 00:15:13.250
<v Speaker 1>speakers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how well can you understand java candle?</v>

275

<v Speaker 1>description for you to see before </v>

276
00:15:17.331 --> 00:15:20.350
<v Speaker 1>commenting if you want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and for java speakers,</v>

277
00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:24.470
<v Speaker 1>how weLl can you understand spanish?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does it depend on the variety of spanish</v>

278
00:15:24.471 --> 00:15:26.930
<v Speaker 1>or on the context?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Be sure to follow lang,</v>

279
00:15:26.931 --> 00:15:28.640
