<v Speaker 2>That's just another little sample of my </v>

27
00:02:01.001 --> 00:02:03.550
<v Speaker 2>progress and to gallog how it's going.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

28
00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:05.590
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>obviously I'm not fluent.</v>

29
00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:07.960
<v Speaker 2>I can express myself about simple </v>
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>

30
00:02:07.961 --> 00:02:08.794
<v Speaker 2>I could make simple sentences,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can communicate about basic things </v>

31
00:02:12.281 --> 00:02:13.114
<v Speaker 2>with basic vocab,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but for three weeks in I'm pretty happy </v>

32
00:02:15.101 --> 00:02:17.230
<v Speaker 2>with how things are going.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

33
00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:18.363
<v Speaker 2>I'm looking forward to my trip to </v>
<v Speaker 2>Philippines next week and I'll try out </v>

34
00:02:20.861 --> 00:02:21.694
<v Speaker 2>my to gallog they're more and practice </v>
<v Speaker 2>more and I'm going to study while I'm </v>

35
00:02:23.501 --> 00:02:26.410
<v Speaker 2>there and hopefully that will expand my </v>
<v Speaker 2>ability even more.</v>

36
00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:31.630
<v Speaker 2>Tagalog is an interesting experience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The only other thing I can compare it to</v>

37
00:02:31.631 --> 00:02:32.464
<v Speaker 2>is when I started studying Japanese way </v>
<v Speaker 2>back in the beginning years and years </v>

38
00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:37.533
<v Speaker 2>ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because before that I had only studied </v>

39
00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:43.480
<v Speaker 2>languages that were much more similar to</v>
<v Speaker 2>English.</v>

40
00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:44.613
<v Speaker 2>Like I had studied French in school,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had studied Hebrew and modern Hebrew </v>

41
00:02:49.031 --> 00:02:51.460
<v Speaker 2>kind of has syntax that's similar to </v>
<v Speaker 2>English.</v>

42
00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:53.470
<v Speaker 2>Like the word order is different from </v>
<v Speaker 2>biblical Hebrew.</v>

43
00:02:53.471 --> 00:02:56.710
<v Speaker 2>It's more like English.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when I started learning Japanese,</v>

44
00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:59.110
<v Speaker 2>the word order and the grammar and </v>
<v Speaker 2>sentence structure,</v>

45
00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:00.273
<v Speaker 2>something completely different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It kind of was difficult at first and </v>

46
00:03:03.491 --> 00:03:04.450
<v Speaker 2>freaked me out a bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

47
00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:07.330
<v Speaker 2>because I had to think in a whole new </v>
<v Speaker 2>way and piece together.</v>

48
00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:10.330
<v Speaker 2>The ideas to make sentences in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>completely new way.</v>

49
00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:14.590
<v Speaker 2>It couldn't just change out the words </v>
<v Speaker 2>like you can in some other languages.</v>

50
00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:17.200
<v Speaker 2>And now Tagalog is kind of similar to </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

51
00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:18.063
<v Speaker 2>Similar to the old days when I started </v>
<v Speaker 2>Japanese and I was freaking out about </v>

52
00:03:20.831 --> 00:03:24.730
<v Speaker 2>this completely new way of expressing </v>
<v Speaker 2>myself and to Gal looks Kinda like that,</v>

53
00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:29.410
<v Speaker 2>that you can't just change the words out</v>
<v Speaker 2>into a tagalog words.</v>

54
00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:32.500
<v Speaker 2>You can't just take an English sentence </v>
<v Speaker 2>and change the words and to,</v>

55
00:03:32.501 --> 00:03:34.630
<v Speaker 2>to Gallog it won't happen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>won't,</v>

56
00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:36.940
<v Speaker 2>you won't be able to express yourself </v>
<v Speaker 2>like that at all.</v>

57
00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.910
<v Speaker 2>No one would understand that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Totally different experience.</v>

58
00:03:39.911 --> 00:03:42.500
<v Speaker 2>So that's quite fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Quite interesting to do that.</v>

59
00:03:42.501 --> 00:03:43.334
<v Speaker 2>It's quite mind bending and it makes me </v>
<v Speaker 2>think in new ways and I always enjoy </v>

60
00:03:45.971 --> 00:03:47.560
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>

61
00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:48.423
<v Speaker 2>that's another look at how it's going.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hope you are busy studying too and </v>

62
00:03:51.071 --> 00:03:53.320
<v Speaker 2>improving at whatever language you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>focused on.</v>

63
00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:54.533
<v Speaker 2>Good night.</v>
