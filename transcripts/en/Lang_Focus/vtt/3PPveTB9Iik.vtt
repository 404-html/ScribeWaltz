00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:07.493
<v Speaker 1>Good evening guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a video about studying multiple </v>

2
00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:11.033
<v Speaker 1>foreign languages and how you can switch</v>
<v Speaker 1>between those different languages </v>

3
00:00:14.731 --> 00:00:17.520
<v Speaker 1>without getting confused and mixed up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A.</v>

4
00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:18.373
<v Speaker 1>You've looked at my channel before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've seen that I've studied a number </v>

5
00:00:20.941 --> 00:00:21.774
<v Speaker 1>of different foreign languages.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you've studied a number of </v>

6
00:00:23.791 --> 00:00:24.624
<v Speaker 1>different foreign languages and maybe </v>
<v Speaker 1>you found it kind of confusing or maybe </v>

7
00:00:27.901 --> 00:00:28.734
<v Speaker 1>you've found there's some overlap </v>
<v Speaker 1>between the language or you've crossed </v>

8
00:00:31.951 --> 00:00:32.784
<v Speaker 1>wires between language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it gets confusing when you study </v>

9
00:00:35.641 --> 00:00:36.474
<v Speaker 1>more than one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you keep them all inside your </v>

10
00:00:37.861 --> 00:00:41.160
<v Speaker 1>head and be able to speak more than a </v>
<v Speaker 1>couple languages,</v>

11
00:00:41.161 --> 00:00:42.120
<v Speaker 1>like five,</v>
<v Speaker 1>six,</v>

12
00:00:42.121 --> 00:00:44.070
<v Speaker 1>seven languages?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you do it?</v>

13
00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:45.630
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>keep in mind,</v>

14
00:00:45.631 --> 00:00:46.464
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking from the point of view of </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone who has studied all these </v>

15
00:00:48.871 --> 00:00:50.310
<v Speaker 1>foreign languages.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As an adult,</v>

16
00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.230
<v Speaker 1>I didn't learn any foreign language or </v>
<v Speaker 1>second language as a kid.</v>

17
00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:56.820
<v Speaker 1>I was raised monolingual just speaking </v>
<v Speaker 1>English.</v>

18
00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.390
<v Speaker 1>So this is from that point of view of </v>
<v Speaker 1>learning as an adult.</v>

19
00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:04.740
<v Speaker 1>Someone who learned that as a kid might </v>
<v Speaker 1>be different to keep that in mind.</v>

20
00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:05.970
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

21
00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.390
<v Speaker 1>So basically there are three things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll start with the first one.</v>

22
00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:10.583
<v Speaker 1>I think you really need to refine your </v>
<v Speaker 1>pronunciation for each of the languages </v>

23
00:01:15.151 --> 00:01:17.700
<v Speaker 1>you really need to get specific with </v>
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

24
00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:18.613
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the distinctions you make in the </v>

25
00:01:20.191 --> 00:01:21.024
<v Speaker 1>phonology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so really look at all the different </v>

26
00:01:22.231 --> 00:01:23.064
<v Speaker 1>sounds in each language and get them as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as specific and as precise as possible </v>

27
00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:33.410
<v Speaker 1>because I think a lot of what causes </v>
<v Speaker 1>crossover between different languages is</v>

28
00:01:34.231 --> 00:01:38.940
<v Speaker 1>that you were using the same phonology </v>
<v Speaker 1>or similar phonology for those languages</v>

29
00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.760
<v Speaker 1>when a native speaker has a very </v>
<v Speaker 1>precise,</v>

30
00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:42.683
<v Speaker 1>distinct phonology for that language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this is something that my theory on </v>

31
00:01:47.731 --> 00:01:51.000
<v Speaker 1>this came from studying a few different </v>
<v Speaker 1>languages.</v>

32
00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:55.170
<v Speaker 1>I studied Hebrew and Arabic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which are quite related,</v>

33
00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.960
<v Speaker 1>but the phonology isn't that similar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The quite different.</v>

34
00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:59.213
<v Speaker 1>But also I've studied French and I find </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I've had a lot more crossover </v>

35
00:02:03.271 --> 00:02:07.320
<v Speaker 1>between French and Hebrew.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then between Arabic and Hebrew,</v>

36
00:02:07.321 --> 00:02:11.410
<v Speaker 1>even though French and Hebrew are not </v>
<v Speaker 1>related really a.</v>

37
00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:12.483
<v Speaker 1>and that's because there are some </v>
<v Speaker 1>similar phonological sounds between </v>

38
00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:16.613
<v Speaker 1>Hebrew in French that are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that don't exist between Hebrew and </v>

39
00:02:19.951 --> 00:02:20.784
<v Speaker 1>Arabic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's caused some of the crossover </v>

40
00:02:23.641 --> 00:02:25.080
<v Speaker 1>between them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the phonology,</v>

41
00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.320
<v Speaker 1>it's the similar phonology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in order to solve that problem,</v>

42
00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:33.150
<v Speaker 1>I had to really get precise with my </v>
<v Speaker 1>phonology for French and for Hebrew,</v>

43
00:02:33.151 --> 00:02:33.984
<v Speaker 1>I had to look at all the sounds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at exactly how to pronounce those </v>

44
00:02:36.931 --> 00:02:41.100
<v Speaker 1>sounds that were causing the confusion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you can do that.</v>

45
00:02:41.101 --> 00:02:43.560
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I say refine your pronunciation,</v>

46
00:02:43.561 --> 00:02:47.280
<v Speaker 1>that's in general,</v>
<v Speaker 1>focus on studying your pronunciation and</v>

47
00:02:47.281 --> 00:02:49.500
<v Speaker 1>improving it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get some help from native speakers,</v>

48
00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:52.110
<v Speaker 1>really focused on emulating native </v>
<v Speaker 1>speakers,</v>

49
00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:56.450
<v Speaker 1>but also at a more advanced level of </v>
<v Speaker 1>teach you a little technique that,</v>

50
00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:57.613
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that helps people take it to a more </v>

51
00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:02.170
<v Speaker 1>native level or near native level.</v>

52
00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:03.333
<v Speaker 1>The technique is this imagined that a </v>
<v Speaker 1>particular native speaker is actually </v>

53
00:03:08.891 --> 00:03:11.410
<v Speaker 1>speaking through you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It might sound strange,</v>

54
00:03:11.411 --> 00:03:12.244
<v Speaker 1>but there you're kind of channeling a </v>
<v Speaker 1>certain person through your body and </v>

55
00:03:14.921 --> 00:03:17.560
<v Speaker 1>they're speaking out your mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like when I speak French,</v>

56
00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:21.820
<v Speaker 1>I imagined that Sarcowski,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the former president,</v>

57
00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:22.683
<v Speaker 1>is speaking through me because he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody that I modeled when I was </v>

58
00:03:25.601 --> 00:03:26.434
<v Speaker 1>studying French.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I paid attention to his pronunciation </v>

59
00:03:27.941 --> 00:03:32.170
<v Speaker 1>and tried to copy his intonation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when I speak French,</v>

60
00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:35.560
<v Speaker 1>when I'm trying to get precise with my </v>
<v Speaker 1>pronunciation,</v>

61
00:03:35.561 --> 00:03:38.070
<v Speaker 1>I imagined it's him speaking through me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right?</v>

62
00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:38.913
<v Speaker 1>And when I speak Tagalog,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I imagine a certain Filipino person who </v>

63
00:03:41.921 --> 00:03:42.754
<v Speaker 1>I know who speaks to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I imagine that person is speaking </v>

64
00:03:44.831 --> 00:03:48.350
<v Speaker 1>through me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And by doing that you're really,</v>

65
00:03:48.351 --> 00:03:49.760
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

66
00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:51.123
<v Speaker 1>your brain is picking up on a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>very little subtle cues and the </v>

67
00:03:53.651 --> 00:03:56.500
<v Speaker 1>pronunciation that you can't pick up on </v>
<v Speaker 1>consciously.</v>

68
00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:58.840
<v Speaker 1>If you try to focus on all those little </v>
<v Speaker 1>differences,</v>

69
00:03:59.080 --> 00:03:59.913
<v Speaker 1>you can't really do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you just focus on the whole </v>

70
00:04:02.111 --> 00:04:05.230
<v Speaker 1>person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your unconscious mind can pick up on all</v>

71
00:04:05.231 --> 00:04:09.970
<v Speaker 1>those little fine tuned elements of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>pronunciation and help you out a lot.</v>

72
00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:14.020
<v Speaker 1>So that's one thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's one trick you can try a for getting</v>

73
00:04:14.021 --> 00:04:16.720
<v Speaker 1>your pronunciation to a more authentic </v>
<v Speaker 1>level.</v>

74
00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:19.540
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So focus on the pronunciation.</v>

75
00:04:19.541 --> 00:04:20.374
<v Speaker 1>That's my first piece of advice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The second thing is 100 percent </v>

76
00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:26.150
<v Speaker 1>commitment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no half stepping,</v>

77
00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:30.520
<v Speaker 1>100 percent commitment when you are </v>
<v Speaker 1>switching into the next language.</v>

78
00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:31.593
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when you were moving from one </v>

79
00:04:33.521 --> 00:04:34.354
<v Speaker 1>language into the other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of like you are walking </v>

80
00:04:36.581 --> 00:04:37.414
<v Speaker 1>through a doorway into another room.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you enter the doorway and you just </v>

81
00:04:42.131 --> 00:04:46.030
<v Speaker 1>stand in the doorway and try to speak </v>
<v Speaker 1>the other language of the other room,</v>

82
00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:48.100
<v Speaker 1>you're going to retreat into the first </v>
<v Speaker 1>road.</v>

83
00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:50.230
<v Speaker 1>You're going to go back into the other </v>
<v Speaker 1>language,</v>

84
00:04:50.231 --> 00:04:52.480
<v Speaker 1>or you're going to get some crossover </v>
<v Speaker 1>between the two.</v>

85
00:04:52.481 --> 00:04:56.380
<v Speaker 1>You'll find it hard to really move into </v>
<v Speaker 1>the second language.</v>

86
00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:59.290
<v Speaker 1>So what you really need to do is just </v>
<v Speaker 1>make a firm decision,</v>

87
00:04:59.291 --> 00:05:00.124
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now I'm switching into the other </v>

88
00:05:01.391 --> 00:05:04.540
<v Speaker 1>language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going back into the old one.</v>

89
00:05:04.541 --> 00:05:07.990
<v Speaker 1>I'm walking through the doorway and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>closing the door behind me,</v>

90
00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:09.363
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're,</v>

91
00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:11.320
<v Speaker 1>you're basically just completely </v>
<v Speaker 1>deciding,</v>

92
00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:13.780
<v Speaker 1>I'm speaking this language now and not </v>
<v Speaker 1>the other.</v>

93
00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:17.320
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to switch back and forth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you want to just lock the door behind</v>

94
00:05:17.321 --> 00:05:18.154
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

95
00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:21.850
<v Speaker 1>So it's really just about pushing </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself and making a firm commitment.</v>

96
00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:25.630
<v Speaker 1>And when you make that firm decision to </v>
<v Speaker 1>speak this one,</v>

97
00:05:25.631 --> 00:05:30.631
<v Speaker 1>then it just motivates you and pushes </v>
<v Speaker 1>you forward and takes you into that zone</v>

98
00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:32.470
<v Speaker 1>of that language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

99
00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:35.380
<v Speaker 1>So that's the second thing is just that </v>
<v Speaker 1>100 percent decision.</v>

100
00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:36.970
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to speak French now.</v>

101
00:05:36.971 --> 00:05:40.480
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to speak Arabic now and </v>
<v Speaker 1>completely cut off the language.</v>

102
00:05:40.481 --> 00:05:43.360
<v Speaker 1>You were speaking a moment earlier.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

103
00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:44.223
<v Speaker 1>so that's number two.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Number three is a little more abstract </v>

104
00:05:46.091 --> 00:05:49.060
<v Speaker 1>and it's one that I don't use all that </v>
<v Speaker 1>often anymore,</v>

105
00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:49.953
<v Speaker 1>but I used it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've tried it in the past and made use </v>

106
00:05:52.181 --> 00:05:54.400
<v Speaker 1>of it when I needed it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's like this,</v>

107
00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:55.573
<v Speaker 1>you imagine a scene that you associate </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the language that you want to </v>

108
00:06:00.141 --> 00:06:01.910
<v Speaker 1>speak.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

109
00:06:01.911 --> 00:06:02.744
<v Speaker 1>when I speak French,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I might imagine the scene on the patio </v>

110
00:06:06.051 --> 00:06:08.000
<v Speaker 1>of a cafe in Paris,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

111
00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:08.893
<v Speaker 1>And imagine all of the subtle little,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the subtle little sensory cues that go </v>

112
00:06:13.851 --> 00:06:14.840
<v Speaker 1>along with that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

113
00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:17.590
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the taste of wine at the smell of my,</v>

114
00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:20.010
<v Speaker 1>my baguettes and all that kind stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

115
00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:21.073
<v Speaker 1>and hearing the ambiance around me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hearing the French language spoken </v>

116
00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:25.730
<v Speaker 1>around me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so by doing that,</v>

117
00:06:25.731 --> 00:06:28.910
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're creating a connection between the</v>

118
00:06:28.911 --> 00:06:32.800
<v Speaker 1>language and that image so that whenever</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to move into that,</v>

119
00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:33.933
<v Speaker 1>that state in which you are speaking the</v>
<v Speaker 1>language well than you imagine that </v>

120
00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:40.550
<v Speaker 1>image and that brings you into the zone </v>
<v Speaker 1>of that language.</v>

121
00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:43.130
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's something you can try.</v>

122
00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:46.550
<v Speaker 1>Another example of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I speak Hebrew,</v>

123
00:06:46.551 --> 00:06:47.384
<v Speaker 1>I imagine the time I spent in Jerusalem </v>
<v Speaker 1>because that's a very vivid time for me </v>

124
00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:55.040
<v Speaker 1>so I can bring myself back to that time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Imagine the environment.</v>

125
00:06:55.050 --> 00:06:55.883
<v Speaker 1>Imagine a certain situation I was in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in that place where I can hear Hebrew </v>

126
00:06:59.631 --> 00:07:00.464
<v Speaker 1>speakers and I see a different cultural </v>
<v Speaker 1>things that remind me of the Hebrew </v>

127
00:07:04.401 --> 00:07:05.234
<v Speaker 1>language and all of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So all of those things are associations </v>

128
00:07:07.161 --> 00:07:10.430
<v Speaker 1>that bring me back into the zone when I </v>
<v Speaker 1>was speaking Hebrew.</v>

129
00:07:10.431 --> 00:07:12.870
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of these pieces of advice,</v>

130
00:07:12.871 --> 00:07:16.580
<v Speaker 1>that kind of abstract,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wish I could be a bit more logical and</v>

131
00:07:16.581 --> 00:07:17.414
<v Speaker 1>scientific in the tips I'm giving,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when we're dealing with we're </v>

132
00:07:21.681 --> 00:07:23.750
<v Speaker 1>dealing with switching from one language</v>
<v Speaker 1>to another.</v>

133
00:07:23.751 --> 00:07:24.584
<v Speaker 1>We're we're dealing with switching into </v>
<v Speaker 1>different states and that kind of </v>

134
00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:30.830
<v Speaker 1>requires you to take control of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>perception,</v>

135
00:07:31.130 --> 00:07:31.430
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

136
00:07:31.430 --> 00:07:32.263
<v Speaker 1>It's not the same for everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so if these tips don't really work for </v>

137
00:07:35.301 --> 00:07:37.280
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you don't have to use them.</v>

138
00:07:37.281 --> 00:07:38.114
<v Speaker 1>Of course.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just think about similar types of </v>

139
00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:41.053
<v Speaker 1>techniques and how you can control your </v>
<v Speaker 1>perception in a way that will take you </v>

140
00:07:44.511 --> 00:07:48.170
<v Speaker 1>into that zone where you are speaking </v>
<v Speaker 1>the language well,</v>

141
00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:49.033
<v Speaker 1>so a lot of it has to do with </v>
<v Speaker 1>associations and connections with that </v>

142
00:07:51.891 --> 00:07:55.040
<v Speaker 1>language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Another thing I should point out is that</v>

143
00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:56.833
<v Speaker 1>the language is that you haven't spoken </v>
<v Speaker 1>recently are always going to fade a </v>

144
00:08:00.051 --> 00:08:02.120
<v Speaker 1>little bit if you leave them in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>background,</v>

145
00:08:02.210 --> 00:08:04.670
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The ones that you can move into the most</v>

146
00:08:04.671 --> 00:08:07.610
<v Speaker 1>easily are the ones you have used most </v>
<v Speaker 1>recently,</v>

147
00:08:08.090 --> 00:08:08.923
<v Speaker 1>so don't expect to use one of these </v>
<v Speaker 1>techniques and be able to speak really </v>

148
00:08:13.491 --> 00:08:14.324
<v Speaker 1>well and really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really instantly in a language you </v>

149
00:08:16.401 --> 00:08:18.380
<v Speaker 1>haven't spoken in five years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

150
00:08:18.410 --> 00:08:21.500
<v Speaker 1>you might be able to with the basics of </v>
<v Speaker 1>that language,</v>

151
00:08:21.501 --> 00:08:25.160
<v Speaker 1>but you won't be at the level you were </v>
<v Speaker 1>at five years ago obviously because you,</v>

152
00:08:25.430 --> 00:08:28.070
<v Speaker 1>you start to lose some of the language </v>
<v Speaker 1>gradually.</v>

153
00:08:28.310 --> 00:08:29.900
<v Speaker 1>So just keep that in mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

154
00:08:29.930 --> 00:08:30.763
<v Speaker 1>it's also a matter of just keeping the </v>
<v Speaker 1>language fresh and keeping them a well </v>

155
00:08:34.121 --> 00:08:34.954
<v Speaker 1>practiced.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't always do that with all of </v>

156
00:08:36.411 --> 00:08:37.880
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you speak 10 languages,</v>

157
00:08:37.881 --> 00:08:38.714
<v Speaker 1>you can't speak all 10 every day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you will always have some that are </v>

158
00:08:42.051 --> 00:08:42.884
<v Speaker 1>more ready to go than others.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the others are more waiting in the </v>

159
00:08:45.411 --> 00:08:49.160
<v Speaker 1>background for you to retrieve them and </v>
<v Speaker 1>start to practice and,</v>

160
00:08:49.270 --> 00:08:50.103
<v Speaker 1>and brush up on those languages.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then there'll be in the forefront </v>

161
00:08:54.231 --> 00:08:58.010
<v Speaker 1>end ready to get into the zone again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alright.</v>

162
00:08:58.020 --> 00:09:00.090
<v Speaker 1>So that's all I've got to say about </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

163
00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:02.160
<v Speaker 1>Hope that's clear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Talk to you later.</v>
