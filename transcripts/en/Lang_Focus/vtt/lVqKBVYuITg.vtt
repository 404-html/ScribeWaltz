00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:01.223
<v Speaker 1>Hello everyone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>welcome to the Lange Focus Channel and </v>

2
00:00:03.091 --> 00:00:06.570
<v Speaker 1>my name is Paul.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What languages does the Pope speak?</v>

3
00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:10.380
<v Speaker 1>I want to talk about polyglot pope's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you think of the pope,</v>

4
00:00:10.381 --> 00:00:13.560
<v Speaker 1>you might think of a very holy person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a religious person,</v>

5
00:00:13.561 --> 00:00:16.620
<v Speaker 1>someone who sits around praying all day </v>
<v Speaker 1>or something like that,</v>

6
00:00:16.621 --> 00:00:17.454
<v Speaker 1>but think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To be the leader of a huge organization </v>

7
00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.710
<v Speaker 1>like the Catholic Church,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you have to be a very success minded,</v>

8
00:00:22.711 --> 00:00:23.544
<v Speaker 1>driven then accomplished individually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so let's look at a few recent folks and </v>

9
00:00:26.821 --> 00:00:29.160
<v Speaker 1>see where they rate on the polyglot </v>
<v Speaker 1>scale.</v>

10
00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.380
<v Speaker 1>First,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's talk about the current pope.</v>

11
00:00:31.381 --> 00:00:34.530
<v Speaker 1>Pope Francis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who became the pope in 2013.</v>

12
00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:35.513
<v Speaker 1>He is originally from Argentina and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>speaks Spanish fluently as his native </v>

13
00:00:39.121 --> 00:00:41.700
<v Speaker 1>language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He also speaks Italian fluently.</v>

14
00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:42.713
<v Speaker 1>He learned Italian as a kid when he was </v>
<v Speaker 1>in Argentina from his father and his </v>

15
00:00:46.261 --> 00:00:47.094
<v Speaker 1>grandparents who were Italian immigrants</v>
<v Speaker 1>and early on when he became the pope at </v>

16
00:00:50.281 --> 00:00:51.114
<v Speaker 1>the beginning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he would only speak Italian in public </v>

17
00:00:52.891 --> 00:00:55.020
<v Speaker 1>for the media or in front of audiences.</v>

18
00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:56.123
<v Speaker 1>Italian is the Lingua Franca of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Vatican and it's the most commonly </v>

19
00:00:58.711 --> 00:01:03.330
<v Speaker 1>spoken language in the Vatican,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and also he is the arch bishop of Rome,</v>

20
00:01:03.331 --> 00:01:05.370
<v Speaker 1>so it makes sense that he would speak </v>
<v Speaker 1>Italian,</v>

21
00:01:05.371 --> 00:01:06.204
<v Speaker 1>the language of his own locality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've also heard reports from Brazilian </v>

22
00:01:09.811 --> 00:01:12.330
<v Speaker 1>people that when Pope Francis visited </v>
<v Speaker 1>Brazil,</v>

23
00:01:12.331 --> 00:01:16.680
<v Speaker 1>he spoke fluently in Portuguese,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although with a heavy Argentinian accent</v>

24
00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.260
<v Speaker 1>and apparently the pope speaks also </v>
<v Speaker 1>German and French,</v>

25
00:01:19.261 --> 00:01:21.750
<v Speaker 1>but he is getting rusty due to a lack of</v>
<v Speaker 1>use.</v>

26
00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:22.733
<v Speaker 1>Pope Francis also admits that he's had </v>
<v Speaker 1>quite a hard time learning English in </v>

27
00:01:25.891 --> 00:01:30.060
<v Speaker 1>large part due to English phonology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which he finds hard during a three month</v>

28
00:01:30.061 --> 00:01:32.250
<v Speaker 1>stay in Ireland.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When he tried to learn English,</v>

29
00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:33.143
<v Speaker 1>he had some trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Although I must say I can't blame him </v>

30
00:01:34.861 --> 00:01:38.070
<v Speaker 1>for being confused by the Irish people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Funny Pronunciation.</v>

31
00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:39.210
<v Speaker 1>Sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Irish people.</v>

32
00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.480
<v Speaker 1>Just kidding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>After being the pope for a little over a</v>

33
00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:44.580
<v Speaker 1>year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pope Francis spoke English in public for</v>

34
00:01:44.581 --> 00:01:49.581
<v Speaker 1>the first time in Seoul,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Korea to say yes.</v>

35
00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:55.380
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

36
00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.190
<v Speaker 1>clearly Pope Francis is working on his </v>
<v Speaker 1>English and he's improving it to be able</v>

37
00:01:59.191 --> 00:02:00.990
<v Speaker 1>to do his duties better around the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

38
00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:02.123
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he also knows Latin which is used for </v>

39
00:02:03.571 --> 00:02:07.680
<v Speaker 1>ceremonial purposes and for official </v>
<v Speaker 1>documents in the Vatican and part of his</v>

40
00:02:07.681 --> 00:02:10.620
<v Speaker 1>studies was also filling in biblical </v>
<v Speaker 1>Hebrew and biblical Greek,</v>

41
00:02:10.621 --> 00:02:14.340
<v Speaker 1>which are necessary for Bible study.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Pope Francis speaks Spanish,</v>

42
00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:15.480
<v Speaker 1>Italian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Portuguese,</v>

43
00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.010
<v Speaker 1>some German,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some French,</v>

44
00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:20.340
<v Speaker 1>some English,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and three literary languages for a total</v>

45
00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:24.720
<v Speaker 1>polyglot score of six out of 10.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's pretty darn good by the way,</v>

46
00:02:24.721 --> 00:02:25.554
<v Speaker 1>but he's up against some stiff </v>
<v Speaker 1>competition so I can't give him 10 out </v>

47
00:02:28.021 --> 00:02:28.854
<v Speaker 1>of 10.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Next is pope benedict the 16th who was </v>

48
00:02:31.081 --> 00:02:35.550
<v Speaker 1>the pope from 2005 until 2013 when he </v>
<v Speaker 1>resigned.</v>

49
00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:38.460
<v Speaker 1>He is known for being more of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>legitimate polyglot.</v>

50
00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:41.340
<v Speaker 1>Then Pope Francis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his native language is German,</v>

51
00:02:41.341 --> 00:02:44.100
<v Speaker 1>but he is also known to fluently speak </v>
<v Speaker 1>Italian,</v>

52
00:02:44.101 --> 00:02:46.260
<v Speaker 1>French,</v>
<v Speaker 1>English and Spanish.</v>

53
00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.990
<v Speaker 1>I've also read reports that he speaks </v>
<v Speaker 1>Portuguese,</v>

54
00:02:48.991 --> 00:02:49.824
<v Speaker 1>but not totally fluently,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's very good at Latin and used </v>

55
00:02:52.981 --> 00:02:55.620
<v Speaker 1>Latin more than Pope Francis currently </v>
<v Speaker 1>does as pope,</v>

56
00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:59.200
<v Speaker 1>and of course he can also read biblical </v>
<v Speaker 1>Hebrew and biblical Greek,</v>

57
00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:01.030
<v Speaker 1>but again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not spoken languages.</v>

58
00:03:01.031 --> 00:03:03.010
<v Speaker 1>Those are just classical written </v>
<v Speaker 1>languages.</v>

59
00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:07.300
<v Speaker 1>Pope Benedict made waves in 2013 when he</v>
<v Speaker 1>resigned as the pope,</v>

60
00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:08.163
<v Speaker 1>which is almost completely unheard of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he made waves partly because his </v>

61
00:03:11.801 --> 00:03:12.634
<v Speaker 1>announcement was in Latin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The reporter who broke the story to the </v>

62
00:03:15.311 --> 00:03:16.144
<v Speaker 1>world ended up being the only reporter </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the Vatican press office who could </v>

63
00:03:19.391 --> 00:03:20.224
<v Speaker 1>understand the original report in Latin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's recap for a pope benedict the </v>

64
00:03:23.771 --> 00:03:25.540
<v Speaker 1>16th.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He speaks German,</v>

65
00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:27.010
<v Speaker 1>Italian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Spanish,</v>

66
00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:28.660
<v Speaker 1>French,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and English fluently.</v>

67
00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:29.763
<v Speaker 1>He also speaks some Portuguese and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>speaks lesson he knows to literary </v>

68
00:03:33.191 --> 00:03:34.024
<v Speaker 1>languages,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Greek and Biblical Hebrew for right </v>

69
00:03:35.621 --> 00:03:36.454
<v Speaker 1>total polyglot score of seven out of 10,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the king of polyglot pope's is </v>

70
00:03:40.631 --> 00:03:41.464
<v Speaker 1>without a doubt.</v>

71
00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:46.470
<v Speaker 1>Pope John Paul the second who was the </v>
<v Speaker 1>pope from 1978 until his death in 2005.</v>

72
00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:50.110
<v Speaker 1>Pope John Paul the second was originally</v>
<v Speaker 1>from Poland.</v>

73
00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:53.770
<v Speaker 1>So his native language was Polish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he was also fluent in Italian,</v>

74
00:03:53.771 --> 00:03:55.360
<v Speaker 1>Spanish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Portuguese,</v>

75
00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:58.180
<v Speaker 1>French and English as well as Latin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

76
00:03:58.210 --> 00:03:59.043
<v Speaker 1>Pope John Paul the second is also known </v>
<v Speaker 1>for having a good working knowledge of </v>

77
00:04:01.751 --> 00:04:02.584
<v Speaker 1>some other languages,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least enough to speak publicly in </v>

78
00:04:04.811 --> 00:04:09.220
<v Speaker 1>those languages with some preparation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those languages include Slovak,</v>

79
00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:10.210
<v Speaker 1>Russian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ukrainian,</v>

80
00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:11.530
<v Speaker 1>Japanese,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tagalog,</v>

81
00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:14.620
<v Speaker 1>among many others.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At the end of one Easter mass,</v>

82
00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:19.090
<v Speaker 1>he once gave an Easter greeting in 57 </v>
<v Speaker 1>different languages.</v>

83
00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:22.690
<v Speaker 1>Maybe he loved languages so much because</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was also an avid traveler.</v>

84
00:04:22.691 --> 00:04:23.524
<v Speaker 1>He visited 129 different countries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is more than any other point in </v>

85
00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:28.510
<v Speaker 1>history.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So to recap,</v>

86
00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:31.570
<v Speaker 1>Pope John Paul the second was fluent in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Polish,</v>

87
00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:32.740
<v Speaker 1>Italian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Spanish,</v>

88
00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:33.970
<v Speaker 1>Portuguese,</v>
<v Speaker 1>French,</v>

89
00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:34.923
<v Speaker 1>English and German and Latin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Auntie do a whole bunch of other </v>

90
00:04:37.751 --> 00:04:40.510
<v Speaker 1>languages better than most language </v>
<v Speaker 1>dabblers out there.</v>

91
00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:43.490
<v Speaker 1>So he gets a total polyglot score of 10</v>

92
00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:44.450
<v Speaker 3>out of 10,</v>

93
00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:48.520
<v Speaker 1>whether you're a Catholic or not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pope John Paul,</v>

94
00:04:48.521 --> 00:04:51.970
<v Speaker 1>the second was clearly uninspiring,</v>
<v Speaker 1>polyglot and his language lovers.</v>

95
00:04:51.971 --> 00:04:55.540
<v Speaker 1>We can look up to and admire that aspect</v>
<v Speaker 1>of his life and his work.</v>

96
00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:57.430
<v Speaker 1>Thank you for watching the length.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Focus.</v>

97
00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:58.263
<v Speaker 1>Gentle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have a good night.</v>
