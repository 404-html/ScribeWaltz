<v Speaker 1>Hello everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Welcome to the lane focus channel and my</v>

3
00:00:07.591 --> 00:00:08.424
<v Speaker 1>name is Paul.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Today's topic is the French language or </v>

4
00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:13.943
<v Speaker 1>as it's called in French.</v>
<v Speaker 1>French is a language that really needs </v>

5
00:00:16.621 --> 00:00:17.454
<v Speaker 1>no introduction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the official language of France of </v>

6
00:00:19.531 --> 00:00:20.364
<v Speaker 1>course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's an official language of 29 </v>

7
00:00:22.291 --> 00:00:25.110
<v Speaker 1>countries in total.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That includes other countries in Europe,</v>

8
00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:26.880
<v Speaker 1>namely Belgium,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Switzerland,</v>

9
00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.440
<v Speaker 1>Luxembourg,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Monaco,</v>

10
00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.350
<v Speaker 1>numerous countries in Africa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Canada,</v>

11
00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.720
<v Speaker 1>where it's spoken mainly in the province</v>
<v Speaker 1>of Quebec,</v>

12
00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.390
<v Speaker 1>the Caribbean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>South America,</v>

13
00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:37.703
<v Speaker 1>and the South Pacific.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's estimated that French is spoken by </v>

14
00:00:40.711 --> 00:00:43.740
<v Speaker 1>between 80 and 110 million native </v>
<v Speaker 1>speakers,</v>

15
00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:44.753
<v Speaker 1>but that number doesn't give us a full </v>
<v Speaker 1>picture because between 140 and 180 </v>

16
00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:51.450
<v Speaker 1>million people speak it as a second </v>
<v Speaker 1>language.</v>

17
00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:52.373
<v Speaker 1>The majority of them in Africa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>French is also an important language of </v>

18
00:00:56.671 --> 00:01:00.480
<v Speaker 1>international diplomacy and used to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>the main global Lingua Franca.</v>

19
00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:04.920
<v Speaker 1>French is a member of the Gallo Romance </v>
<v Speaker 1>Branch of the Romance Language family,</v>

20
00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.790
<v Speaker 1>which descended from vulgar Latin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just like all romance languages did.</v>

21
00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.230
<v Speaker 1>It's also part of a smaller subset of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Gallo romance called Lung [inaudible],</v>

22
00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.830
<v Speaker 1>a dialect continuum in northern France,</v>
<v Speaker 1>southern Belgium,</v>

23
00:01:16.831 --> 00:01:19.120
<v Speaker 1>and the channel islands,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which includes Falciani,</v>

24
00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.033
<v Speaker 1>the dialect from which standard French </v>
<v Speaker 1>derived and it's closest relatives </v>

25
00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:24.323
<v Speaker 1>history in the second century bce </v>
<v Speaker 1>present de France was part of the goal </v>

26
00:01:28.561 --> 00:01:30.540
<v Speaker 1>region,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which also included Belgium,</v>

27
00:01:30.541 --> 00:01:31.374
<v Speaker 1>Switzerland,</v>
<v Speaker 1>northern Italy and parts of Germany and </v>

28
00:01:33.421 --> 00:01:36.330
<v Speaker 1>the Netherlands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The gold spoke Galician,</v>

29
00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:37.193
<v Speaker 1>which was not a unified language,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but rather a series of Celtic languages </v>

30
00:01:40.501 --> 00:01:43.380
<v Speaker 1>and dialects,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but very little is known about golish.</v>

31
00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:44.873
<v Speaker 1>The Roman republic conquered Gaul in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>second and fourth centuries bce and in </v>

32
00:01:48.991 --> 00:01:49.824
<v Speaker 1>order to become Roman citizens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>goals were required to adopt the Roman </v>

33
00:01:52.771 --> 00:01:54.570
<v Speaker 1>way of life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>including their language,</v>

34
00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:55.433
<v Speaker 1>Latin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>being able to speak Latin became a way </v>

35
00:01:57.301 --> 00:01:58.134
<v Speaker 1>to gain social status,</v>
<v Speaker 1>economic opportunity and employment in </v>

36
00:02:00.781 --> 00:02:01.680
<v Speaker 1>the civil service.</v>

37
00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:02.843
<v Speaker 1>Over the next few centuries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>golish Latin bilingualism became more </v>

38
00:02:05.731 --> 00:02:09.960
<v Speaker 1>common and eventually Latin dominated </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the golish language has disappeared.</v>

39
00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.720
<v Speaker 1>The common people spoke vulgar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Latin,</v>

40
00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:13.753
<v Speaker 1>a vernacular form of Latin that differed</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the formal written language and </v>

41
00:02:16.531 --> 00:02:19.410
<v Speaker 1>also different from place to place </v>
<v Speaker 1>throughout the Roman Empire.</v>

42
00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:20.453
<v Speaker 1>And I'm feeling Deja Vu right now </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I think I talk about this in </v>

43
00:02:22.951 --> 00:02:27.630
<v Speaker 1>every video about a romance language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Beginning of the year three 75 ce,</v>

44
00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:28.613
<v Speaker 1>the GERMANIC invasions began and </v>
<v Speaker 1>gradually replaced the western Roman </v>

45
00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:33.413
<v Speaker 1>Empire with Germanic Kingdoms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fall of the empire accelerated the </v>

46
00:02:36.241 --> 00:02:39.870
<v Speaker 1>divergence of vulgar Latin into distinct</v>
<v Speaker 1>romantic dialects.</v>

47
00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:43.530
<v Speaker 1>The dialects of northern goal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which would later develop into the lung,</v>

48
00:02:43.531 --> 00:02:44.364
<v Speaker 1>doyle changed more than others because </v>
<v Speaker 1>of frequent contact with Germanic </v>

49
00:02:47.401 --> 00:02:49.830
<v Speaker 1>languages like frankish spoken by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>elite.</v>

50
00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:51.113
<v Speaker 1>The frankish elite spoke both frankish </v>
<v Speaker 1>and romantic and after a while they </v>

51
00:02:54.091 --> 00:02:58.020
<v Speaker 1>spoke mainly romantic dialects,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but frankish left an important footprint</v>

52
00:02:58.021 --> 00:02:58.980
<v Speaker 1>on those dialects.</v>

53
00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:00.153
<v Speaker 1>French,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which developed from one of these </v>

54
00:03:01.181 --> 00:03:02.014
<v Speaker 1>romantic dialect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>got approximately 550 words from </v>

55
00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.250
<v Speaker 1>frankish or around 13% of the total </v>
<v Speaker 1>number of loan words in French,</v>

56
00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:12.070
<v Speaker 1>and it's phonology was greatly </v>
<v Speaker 1>influenced as well.</v>

57
00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:13.503
<v Speaker 1>This is a large part of why French </v>
<v Speaker 1>phonology is so distinct from other </v>

58
00:03:16.451 --> 00:03:17.284
<v Speaker 1>romance languages.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It developed from the German ised </v>

59
00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:21.490
<v Speaker 1>romantic speech of the Frankish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He leads,</v>

60
00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:24.400
<v Speaker 1>but I'm getting ahead of myself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let me back up for a minute.</v>

61
00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:26.980
<v Speaker 1>Old French,</v>
<v Speaker 1>romantic dialects.</v>

62
00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:30.550
<v Speaker 1>Gradually grew into distinct languages </v>
<v Speaker 1>and by the eighth century,</v>

63
00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:31.413
<v Speaker 1>the dialects of the northwestern part of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the frankish kingdom grew into a number </v>

64
00:03:34.751 --> 00:03:38.170
<v Speaker 1>of dialects that are collectively </v>
<v Speaker 1>referred to as old French,</v>

65
00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:40.810
<v Speaker 1>which later began to be called the </v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible].</v>

66
00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:41.673
<v Speaker 1>As they developed further,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was no standard form of old </v>

67
00:03:44.411 --> 00:03:46.450
<v Speaker 1>French,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but rather a dialect continuum.</v>

68
00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:47.583
<v Speaker 1>One of those dialects from Sia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well spoken in a small area around </v>

69
00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:51.373
<v Speaker 1>Paris,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's the old French variety from </v>

70
00:03:53.021 --> 00:03:56.590
<v Speaker 1>which standard French developed for </v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] is a modern word.</v>

71
00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:58.930
<v Speaker 1>At the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the dialect was actually cold.</v>

72
00:03:58.931 --> 00:04:01.860
<v Speaker 1>Frost sweat that name later evolved into</v>
<v Speaker 1>Francais,</v>

73
00:04:01.861 --> 00:04:03.640
<v Speaker 1>say the name of French.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Today,</v>

74
00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:04.683
<v Speaker 1>the king of the upper classes spoke </v>
<v Speaker 1>frankish Latin was the language of </v>

75
00:04:07.601 --> 00:04:08.434
<v Speaker 1>writing and the Coleman people who were </v>
<v Speaker 1>mostly illiterate spoke one of the </v>

76
00:04:11.291 --> 00:04:14.530
<v Speaker 1>various dialects,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but over the next few centuries,</v>

77
00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:18.760
<v Speaker 1>the upper classes began to speak from </v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] under King Louie.</v>

78
00:04:18.761 --> 00:04:19.594
<v Speaker 1>The ninth from Sudan gained new prestige</v>
<v Speaker 1>and was adopted by the upper classes in </v>

79
00:04:23.561 --> 00:04:24.394
<v Speaker 1>cities around the kingdom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Coleman people continued to speak </v>

80
00:04:26.651 --> 00:04:30.460
<v Speaker 1>local dialects and Latin continued to </v>
<v Speaker 1>serve as the language of education,</v>

81
00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:33.400
<v Speaker 1>the courts and academia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Throughout the Catholic world.</v>

82
00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:35.673
<v Speaker 1>Under King Phillip,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fourth French began to be used as </v>

83
00:04:37.961 --> 00:04:38.794
<v Speaker 1>the language of official documents and </v>
<v Speaker 1>government and began to compete with </v>

84
00:04:41.681 --> 00:04:44.440
<v Speaker 1>Latin as a written language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Middle French.</v>

85
00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:47.620
<v Speaker 1>During the middle French period,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the French changed dramatically,</v>

86
00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:48.513
<v Speaker 1>particularly in its phonology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but scholars tried to maintain the </v>

87
00:04:51.161 --> 00:04:51.994
<v Speaker 1>language,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which means that the written French of </v>

88
00:04:53.201 --> 00:04:56.020
<v Speaker 1>today often reflects the pronunciation </v>
<v Speaker 1>of French.</v>

89
00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:56.853
<v Speaker 1>Before those changes took place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>old French had two cases retained from </v>

90
00:05:00.431 --> 00:05:02.470
<v Speaker 1>Latin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but those also disappeared in the middle</v>

91
00:05:02.471 --> 00:05:06.130
<v Speaker 1>French and this resulted in the word </v>
<v Speaker 1>order of French being more fixed.</v>

92
00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:07.173
<v Speaker 1>This was during the renaissance period </v>
<v Speaker 1>when the cultural dominance of Italy </v>

93
00:05:10.001 --> 00:05:10.834
<v Speaker 1>influenced French 8,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>Italian vocabulary words entered French </v>

94
00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:18.100
<v Speaker 1>800 of which are still in use today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In the 16th century,</v>

95
00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:18.993
<v Speaker 1>King Francois,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first sign of the ordinance of </v>

96
00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:21.903
<v Speaker 1>vehicle which made French the official </v>
<v Speaker 1>language of administration instead of </v>

97
00:05:25.601 --> 00:05:26.434
<v Speaker 1>Latin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Catholic church fought hard against </v>

98
00:05:28.421 --> 00:05:29.254
<v Speaker 1>this move and didn't want the holy </v>
<v Speaker 1>scriptures to be translated into common </v>

99
00:05:32.321 --> 00:05:34.870
<v Speaker 1>languages,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but their efforts ultimately failed.</v>

100
00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:36.603
<v Speaker 1>The printing press also helped to spread</v>
<v Speaker 1>French because more people could read </v>

101
00:05:39.551 --> 00:05:41.320
<v Speaker 1>and understand it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then they could Latin.</v>

102
00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:43.630
<v Speaker 1>So publishers printed more books in </v>
<v Speaker 1>French.</v>

103
00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:45.123
<v Speaker 1>Modern French in the 17th century,</v>
<v Speaker 1>French took the place of Latin as the </v>

104
00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:51.790
<v Speaker 1>Lingua Franca of Europe and the Catholic</v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

105
00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:55.840
<v Speaker 1>This was also the century in which </v>
<v Speaker 1>grammarians sought to standardize proper</v>

106
00:05:55.841 --> 00:05:56.674
<v Speaker 1>French with the publishing French </v>
<v Speaker 1>grammars and the Academy Frost says was </v>

107
00:06:00.171 --> 00:06:01.004
<v Speaker 1>founded in 1635 with the mission of </v>
<v Speaker 1>promoting proper French and preserving </v>

108
00:06:04.971 --> 00:06:06.950
<v Speaker 1>that form of the language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At that time,</v>

109
00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:10.730
<v Speaker 1>only a small percentage of the people in</v>
<v Speaker 1>France actually spoken French.</v>

110
00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:15.230
<v Speaker 1>Most of them spoke other along the oil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The other regional varieties of speech.</v>

111
00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:16.303
<v Speaker 1>Later in 1880 universal education would </v>
<v Speaker 1>be established and French would be made </v>

112
00:06:20.431 --> 00:06:24.650
<v Speaker 1>to the soul language of education and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the only language permitted to be spoken</v>

113
00:06:24.651 --> 00:06:25.484
<v Speaker 1>at school.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This measure would push standard French </v>

114
00:06:27.291 --> 00:06:29.840
<v Speaker 1>to be near universally spoken throughout</v>
<v Speaker 1>the country.</v>

115
00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:31.093
<v Speaker 1>In the 18th century,</v>
<v Speaker 1>French became the language of </v>

116
00:06:32.961 --> 00:06:33.794
<v Speaker 1>international diplomacy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>used an international legal documents </v>

117
00:06:36.651 --> 00:06:40.040
<v Speaker 1>and so on reaching a status similar to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the status of English.</v>

118
00:06:40.041 --> 00:06:40.874
<v Speaker 1>Today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>French maintained the status until the </v>

119
00:06:42.891 --> 00:06:44.330
<v Speaker 1>time of the first world war.</v>

120
00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:49.040
<v Speaker 1>French may not currently be the most </v>
<v Speaker 1>widely spoken global Lingua Franca,</v>

121
00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:51.110
<v Speaker 1>but it's still an important diplomatic </v>
<v Speaker 1>language.</v>

122
00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:54.950
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the official languages of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the UN and the European Union,</v>

123
00:06:55.010 --> 00:06:58.460
<v Speaker 1>international courts as well as aid </v>
<v Speaker 1>agencies and NGO's.</v>

124
00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:02.120
<v Speaker 1>Why is French spoken in so many </v>
<v Speaker 1>countries around the world?</v>

125
00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:03.253
<v Speaker 1>That's because in the 17th century,</v>
<v Speaker 1>France began establishing colonies all </v>

126
00:07:06.351 --> 00:07:07.184
<v Speaker 1>over the globe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>After losing most of these colonies in </v>

127
00:07:09.171 --> 00:07:10.004
<v Speaker 1>wars with other colonial powers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>France began a second colonial empire </v>

128
00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:16.640
<v Speaker 1>establishing mainly colonies in Africa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Southeast Asia,</v>

129
00:07:16.641 --> 00:07:17.474
<v Speaker 1>and the South Pacific.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Aside from a few overseas departments </v>

130
00:07:20.271 --> 00:07:23.360
<v Speaker 1>and territories of France,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these colonies no longer exist,</v>

131
00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:26.390
<v Speaker 1>but French is still spoken in many of </v>
<v Speaker 1>those places.</v>

132
00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:28.153
<v Speaker 1>So what is French like?</v>
<v Speaker 1>French naturally shares a lot in common </v>

133
00:07:30.981 --> 00:07:33.950
<v Speaker 1>with other romance languages and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Speakers of romance languages.</v>

134
00:07:33.951 --> 00:07:36.860
<v Speaker 1>We'll find it familiar and </v>
<v Speaker 1>comprehensible in many ways,</v>

135
00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:37.753
<v Speaker 1>especially in its written form.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's phonology is quite distinct </v>

136
00:07:40.731 --> 00:07:41.564
<v Speaker 1>from other romance languages and its </v>
<v Speaker 1>pronunciation is often not intuitive </v>

137
00:07:44.751 --> 00:07:45.584
<v Speaker 1>based on the spelling because it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>orthography often reflect pronunciation </v>

138
00:07:48.771 --> 00:07:51.650
<v Speaker 1>from an earlier time pronunciation and </v>
<v Speaker 1>orthography.</v>

139
00:07:52.220 --> 00:07:54.800
<v Speaker 1>In old French,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there were diphthongs and trip thongs.</v>

140
00:07:54.860 --> 00:07:57.710
<v Speaker 1>But these became simple vowels,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so today in French,</v>

141
00:07:57.740 --> 00:08:00.470
<v Speaker 1>there are vowels that look like </v>
<v Speaker 1>diphthongs are trip thongs,</v>

142
00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:03.380
<v Speaker 1>but represents the vowel sounds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

143
00:08:04.540 --> 00:08:05.373
<v Speaker 1>fruit flir.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can see that all of these words </v>

144
00:08:09.201 --> 00:08:12.780
<v Speaker 1>contain a single vowel sound,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but are spelled like diphthongs are trip</v>

145
00:08:12.781 --> 00:08:13.614
<v Speaker 1>thongs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There were also a number of nasal </v>

146
00:08:15.531 --> 00:08:16.364
<v Speaker 1>vowels.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Typically when an n or an m comes after </v>

147
00:08:18.741 --> 00:08:20.510
<v Speaker 1>a vowel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not pronounced,</v>

148
00:08:20.540 --> 00:08:23.750
<v Speaker 1>but the proceeding vowel is nasal ised.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

149
00:08:24.300 --> 00:08:25.133
<v Speaker 1>from shrimp pumps.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's a phrase with several nasal </v>

150
00:08:29.781 --> 00:08:31.630
<v Speaker 1>vowels.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bovine below.</v>

151
00:08:33.230 --> 00:08:35.090
<v Speaker 1>There are some exceptions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

152
00:08:35.091 --> 00:08:38.060
<v Speaker 1>when an adjective or noun takes a </v>
<v Speaker 1>feminine ending eat,</v>

153
00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:42.920
<v Speaker 1>there's shank with a nasal vowel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then there's Shin with an oral vowel</v>

154
00:08:42.980 --> 00:08:47.390
<v Speaker 1>and an end zone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are also a number of diacritics or</v>

155
00:08:47.391 --> 00:08:51.050
<v Speaker 1>written accents in French.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Four of these appear on vowels.</v>

156
00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:56.010
<v Speaker 1>The first is the [inaudible] Xle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or a cute accent,</v>

157
00:08:56.190 --> 00:08:59.730
<v Speaker 1>which is used on the letter e.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This represents an a sound,</v>

158
00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:01.770
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Luke ethic.</v>

159
00:09:02.190 --> 00:09:05.400
<v Speaker 1>Then there's the exome glove or grave </v>
<v Speaker 1>accent.</v>

160
00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:06.593
<v Speaker 1>With Anu.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's used mainly to distinguish between </v>

161
00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:11.100
<v Speaker 1>otherwise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>similarly looking and sounding words.</v>

162
00:09:11.340 --> 00:09:12.510
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oop,</v>

163
00:09:12.870 --> 00:09:17.400
<v Speaker 1>meaning where versus Ooh meaning or with</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ie.</v>

164
00:09:17.460 --> 00:09:18.293
<v Speaker 1>The grave accent indicates that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>sound is like the Ian Bet as opposed to </v>

165
00:09:21.931 --> 00:09:24.720
<v Speaker 1>an e with an acute accent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which sounds like a,</v>

166
00:09:25.950 --> 00:09:26.783
<v Speaker 1>then there's the excellent dilemma.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This shows that two side by side vowel </v>

167
00:09:29.821 --> 00:09:32.700
<v Speaker 1>symbols are pronounced independently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

168
00:09:32.820 --> 00:09:33.750
<v Speaker 1>chorus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He don'ts,</v>

169
00:09:34.130 --> 00:09:38.010
<v Speaker 1>I mean in coincidence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then there's the circumflex accent which</v>

170
00:09:38.011 --> 00:09:38.844
<v Speaker 1>can appear on any vowel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This indicates that the vowel was </v>

171
00:09:41.041 --> 00:09:43.890
<v Speaker 1>historically followed by an s for </v>
<v Speaker 1>example.</v>

172
00:09:44.070 --> 00:09:46.110
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning a party.</v>

173
00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:47.273
<v Speaker 1>Just to illustrate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's look at the Italian cognates of </v>

174
00:09:49.171 --> 00:09:50.200
<v Speaker 1>this word,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Huna.</v>

175
00:09:50.210 --> 00:09:51.043
<v Speaker 1>Festa.</v>

176
00:09:51.060 --> 00:09:54.780
<v Speaker 1>Notice that there's an s in the Italian </v>
<v Speaker 1>word in an earlier form of French.</v>

177
00:09:54.870 --> 00:09:59.870
<v Speaker 1>There was an s after the eat and before </v>
<v Speaker 1>the tea siggy or Savilla,</v>

178
00:10:00.270 --> 00:10:02.940
<v Speaker 1>which indicates that the c sounds like </v>
<v Speaker 1>an s.</v>

179
00:10:04.380 --> 00:10:05.213
<v Speaker 1>Please note that the [inaudible] is not </v>
<v Speaker 1>used when the consonant comes before an </v>

180
00:10:08.491 --> 00:10:12.630
<v Speaker 1>I or an e because a c in that position </v>
<v Speaker 1>is always pronounced like an s.</v>

181
00:10:12.631 --> 00:10:13.464
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there were also silent consonants in </v>

182
00:10:16.111 --> 00:10:18.870
<v Speaker 1>French consonants that are written but </v>
<v Speaker 1>not pronounced.</v>

183
00:10:19.170 --> 00:10:22.020
<v Speaker 1>This includes most consonants that come </v>
<v Speaker 1>at the end of a word.</v>

184
00:10:22.170 --> 00:10:25.530
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shut hope vet.</v>

185
00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:28.530
<v Speaker 1>There is the masculine form of an </v>
<v Speaker 1>adjective,</v>

186
00:10:28.830 --> 00:10:33.150
<v Speaker 1>but in the feminine form of adjectives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the final consonant is pronounced and in</v>

187
00:10:33.151 --> 00:10:37.940
<v Speaker 1>writing and he is placed after it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's fair but that,</v>

188
00:10:38.730 --> 00:10:39.563
<v Speaker 1>but not all final consonants are silent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Certain consonants are often but not </v>

189
00:10:42.661 --> 00:10:45.870
<v Speaker 1>always pronounced at the end </v>
<v Speaker 1>specifically see R,F</v>

190
00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:48.990
<v Speaker 1>and l,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the consonants in the word careful.</v>

191
00:10:49.140 --> 00:10:54.140
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>after the other positive grammar,</v>

192
00:10:55.500 --> 00:10:59.040
<v Speaker 1>let's look at word order in very simple </v>
<v Speaker 1>Svo sentences.</v>

193
00:10:59.070 --> 00:11:01.650
<v Speaker 1>The word order of French is basically </v>
<v Speaker 1>the same as English.</v>

194
00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:02.633
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's a sentence meaning he likes </v>

195
00:11:04.081 --> 00:11:06.990
<v Speaker 1>movies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] word for word.</v>

196
00:11:06.991 --> 00:11:10.710
<v Speaker 1>It's he likes the films,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we have subject,</v>

197
00:11:10.770 --> 00:11:11.790
<v Speaker 1>verb,</v>
<v Speaker 1>object,</v>

198
00:11:12.090 --> 00:11:12.923
<v Speaker 1>but already we see that something is </v>
<v Speaker 1>different from the English sentence </v>

199
00:11:15.060 --> 00:11:17.220
<v Speaker 1>because there's a definite article in </v>
<v Speaker 1>English.</v>

200
00:11:17.221 --> 00:11:20.760
<v Speaker 1>The definite article would only be used </v>
<v Speaker 1>to refer to specific films,</v>

201
00:11:20.910 --> 00:11:21.743
<v Speaker 1>but in French the definite article is </v>
<v Speaker 1>also used for general statements like </v>

202
00:11:24.691 --> 00:11:27.510
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Articles in French are somewhat complex.</v>

203
00:11:27.570 --> 00:11:28.403
<v Speaker 1>We'll come back to those a little later.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The word order starts to become more </v>

204
00:11:31.231 --> 00:11:34.110
<v Speaker 1>different from English when there are </v>
<v Speaker 1>object pronouns in the sentence.</v>

205
00:11:34.170 --> 00:11:36.570
<v Speaker 1>So there's this sentence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning I see the building,</v>

206
00:11:36.750 --> 00:11:40.710
<v Speaker 1>she was worried about smoke,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then there's jut have one meaning.</v>

207
00:11:40.711 --> 00:11:43.260
<v Speaker 1>I see it word for word,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's I it.</v>

208
00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:44.153
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see that the object Pronoun comes </v>

209
00:11:45.991 --> 00:11:47.640
<v Speaker 1>before the verb,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not after it.</v>

210
00:11:48.390 --> 00:11:50.610
<v Speaker 1>And then there are sentences with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>direct object.</v>

211
00:11:50.611 --> 00:11:52.440
<v Speaker 1>Pronouns end,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an indirect object.</v>

212
00:11:52.441 --> 00:11:56.350
<v Speaker 1>Pronouns [inaudible] this means Paul </v>
<v Speaker 1>gives me money.</v>

213
00:11:56.590 --> 00:11:58.780
<v Speaker 1>Paul to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gives some money.</v>

214
00:11:59.230 --> 00:12:02.920
<v Speaker 1>Now let's change the direct object to a </v>
<v Speaker 1>Pronoun Miller done.</v>

215
00:12:03.190 --> 00:12:05.650
<v Speaker 1>This means Paul gives it to me word for </v>
<v Speaker 1>word.</v>

216
00:12:05.651 --> 00:12:06.484
<v Speaker 1>It's Paul.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To me it gives and if we make it </v>

217
00:12:09.161 --> 00:12:09.994
<v Speaker 1>negative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it becomes even more different from </v>

218
00:12:11.201 --> 00:12:12.034
<v Speaker 1>English.</v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] the [inaudible] and pop </v>

219
00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:17.110
<v Speaker 1>constitute the negative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So word for word,</v>

220
00:12:17.111 --> 00:12:21.040
<v Speaker 1>it's Paul negative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To me it give not.</v>

221
00:12:21.490 --> 00:12:22.323
<v Speaker 1>There are more differences beyond these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that gives you a bit of an idea for </v>

222
00:12:24.731 --> 00:12:27.250
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Basically the word order is more similar</v>

223
00:12:27.251 --> 00:12:28.084
<v Speaker 1>when there are no object pronouns.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's briefly look at a few other </v>

224
00:12:31.271 --> 00:12:33.370
<v Speaker 1>grammatical features.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A French gender.</v>

225
00:12:33.670 --> 00:12:35.800
<v Speaker 1>All nouns have either masculine or </v>
<v Speaker 1>feminine.</v>

226
00:12:35.801 --> 00:12:36.730
<v Speaker 1>Gender and French.</v>

227
00:12:36.820 --> 00:12:37.653
<v Speaker 1>The gender of the noun is also reflected</v>
<v Speaker 1>in articles before the nouns and </v>

228
00:12:40.841 --> 00:12:43.240
<v Speaker 1>adjectives that modify it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

229
00:12:43.390 --> 00:12:46.850
<v Speaker 1>the word for hat shut boob is masculine </v>
<v Speaker 1>Lou Shapiro.</v>

230
00:12:46.920 --> 00:12:47.753
<v Speaker 1>Blue means the blue hat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the definite article and the adjective </v>

231
00:12:51.101 --> 00:12:55.030
<v Speaker 1>are masculine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The word for shirt shimmies is feminine.</v>

232
00:12:55.280 --> 00:12:57.730
<v Speaker 1>Less should means blue means that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>blue shirt,</v>

233
00:12:57.970 --> 00:13:01.780
<v Speaker 1>the definite article in the adjective or</v>
<v Speaker 1>feminine articles.</v>

234
00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:04.030
<v Speaker 1>There are three types of articles in </v>
<v Speaker 1>French,</v>

235
00:13:04.060 --> 00:13:06.340
<v Speaker 1>definite,</v>
<v Speaker 1>indefinite and partitive.</v>

236
00:13:06.970 --> 00:13:09.100
<v Speaker 1>All three types of articles have </v>
<v Speaker 1>masculine,</v>

237
00:13:09.101 --> 00:13:13.450
<v Speaker 1>feminine and plural forms and definite </v>
<v Speaker 1>and positive articles have special forms</v>

238
00:13:13.451 --> 00:13:16.060
<v Speaker 1>before avowal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are positive of articles?</v>

239
00:13:16.090 --> 00:13:18.490
<v Speaker 1>You might ask?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well there indefinite,</v>

240
00:13:18.550 --> 00:13:19.383
<v Speaker 1>but they refer to a vague unspecified </v>
<v Speaker 1>quantity often for food or abstract </v>

241
00:13:23.531 --> 00:13:25.090
<v Speaker 1>qualities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

242
00:13:25.720 --> 00:13:28.570
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] you get to meaning I would </v>
<v Speaker 1>like some cake.</v>

243
00:13:28.870 --> 00:13:31.840
<v Speaker 1>The amount of cake is vague,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we use the part of article.</v>

244
00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:33.153
<v Speaker 1>Nouns are almost always proceeded by </v>
<v Speaker 1>articles in French unless there's a </v>

245
00:13:35.981 --> 00:13:36.814
<v Speaker 1>different determiner before the now such</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a possessive pronouns like mine or a </v>

246
00:13:40.931 --> 00:13:42.790
<v Speaker 1>demonstrative pronouns like that.</v>

247
00:13:44.110 --> 00:13:47.330
<v Speaker 1>Negation before we saw the phrase bone </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the middle of them,</v>

248
00:13:47.950 --> 00:13:50.920
<v Speaker 1>which is negative with the negation in </v>
<v Speaker 1>two parts.</v>

249
00:13:51.040 --> 00:13:54.130
<v Speaker 1>No and pot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not always pot that's used.</v>

250
00:13:54.590 --> 00:13:58.000
<v Speaker 1>No [inaudible] means never.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

251
00:13:58.330 --> 00:14:02.400
<v Speaker 1>even a [inaudible] means he never works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

252
00:14:03.230 --> 00:14:05.110
<v Speaker 1>it means nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

253
00:14:05.410 --> 00:14:09.850
<v Speaker 1>an emotional yeah means she eats nothing</v>
<v Speaker 1>or she doesn't eat anything.</v>

254
00:14:11.100 --> 00:14:16.100
<v Speaker 1>Best son means nobody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Zuni Zuni Besson means I saw no one or I</v>

255
00:14:16.451 --> 00:14:17.284
<v Speaker 1>didn't see anyone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Leon and pest son can also be the </v>

256
00:14:20.231 --> 00:14:21.064
<v Speaker 1>subject of the sentence best so never </v>
<v Speaker 1>knew means nobody came and the end of </v>

257
00:14:25.270 --> 00:14:28.420
<v Speaker 1>CPC means nothing happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Verbs.</v>

258
00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:31.150
<v Speaker 1>The verb system of French is fairly </v>
<v Speaker 1>complex.</v>

259
00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:33.520
<v Speaker 1>If we include all of the compound </v>
<v Speaker 1>tenses,</v>

260
00:14:33.521 --> 00:14:34.354
<v Speaker 1>moods and aspects,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are 14 tenses plus the imperative </v>

261
00:14:37.331 --> 00:14:38.164
<v Speaker 1>form.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's look at a couple of the basic </v>

262
00:14:39.431 --> 00:14:40.630
<v Speaker 1>tenses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's fucked.</v>

263
00:14:40.631 --> 00:14:44.560
<v Speaker 1>Liz shimmies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This means he's wearing the shirt is the</v>

264
00:14:44.561 --> 00:14:45.940
<v Speaker 1>present tense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Third Person,</v>

265
00:14:45.941 --> 00:14:47.710
<v Speaker 1>masculine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>singular conjugation.</v>

266
00:14:48.370 --> 00:14:49.203
<v Speaker 1>But let's change this to the future </v>
<v Speaker 1>tense means this means he will wear the </v>

267
00:14:53.361 --> 00:14:54.194
<v Speaker 1>shirt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now let's change this to the imperfect </v>

268
00:14:56.001 --> 00:14:59.180
<v Speaker 1>tense buffet to mean he was wearing the </v>
<v Speaker 1>shirt.</v>

269
00:14:59.930 --> 00:15:01.090
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible].</v>

270
00:15:01.370 --> 00:15:05.720
<v Speaker 1>The imperfect shows that the action was </v>
<v Speaker 1>ongoing at a certain point in the past.</v>

271
00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:07.393
<v Speaker 1>If you want to express that the action </v>
<v Speaker 1>was completed at a certain point in the </v>

272
00:15:10.071 --> 00:15:10.904
<v Speaker 1>past,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can use the passe composition </v>

273
00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:14.750
<v Speaker 1>bicycle boozy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>either Taylor shoney's,</v>

274
00:15:15.020 --> 00:15:15.853
<v Speaker 1>that means he wore the shirt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can see that in the past a </v>

275
00:15:17.901 --> 00:15:20.930
<v Speaker 1>composite,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is an auxiliary verb of Y,</v>

276
00:15:21.050 --> 00:15:25.040
<v Speaker 1>which means to have and it's followed by</v>
<v Speaker 1>the past participle of the main verb,</v>

277
00:15:25.150 --> 00:15:27.630
<v Speaker 1>Dok Day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For some verbs in the past,</v>

278
00:15:27.631 --> 00:15:28.464
<v Speaker 1>say composition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>particularly reflexive verbs and those </v>

279
00:15:30.381 --> 00:15:31.214
<v Speaker 1>showing movement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a different auxiliary verb is used to </v>

280
00:15:33.981 --> 00:15:35.300
<v Speaker 1>be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

281
00:15:35.510 --> 00:15:38.600
<v Speaker 1>eat is salty dynamism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This means he left the house.</v>

282
00:15:39.290 --> 00:15:44.290
<v Speaker 1>You can see that the auxiliary verb is a</v>
<v Speaker 1>form of ed rather than a voir vocabulary</v>

283
00:15:45.530 --> 00:15:46.363
<v Speaker 1>as a romance language,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most French vocabulary is of Latin </v>

284
00:15:48.861 --> 00:15:51.380
<v Speaker 1>origin and some of the more modern </v>
<v Speaker 1>vocabulary.</v>

285
00:15:51.410 --> 00:15:54.350
<v Speaker 1>Our hybrid words built from both Latin </v>
<v Speaker 1>and Greek roots.</v>

286
00:15:54.650 --> 00:15:57.740
<v Speaker 1>English vocabulary has been greatly </v>
<v Speaker 1>influenced by French,</v>

287
00:15:57.800 --> 00:15:58.633
<v Speaker 1>so English speakers will likely notice a</v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of French words that look like </v>

288
00:16:01.071 --> 00:16:03.050
<v Speaker 1>English ones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way they're pronounced.</v>

289
00:16:03.051 --> 00:16:04.160
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's quite different.</v>

290
00:16:04.310 --> 00:16:05.960
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>information,</v>

291
00:16:06.360 --> 00:16:08.930
<v Speaker 1>Phil Messer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>danger g,</v>

292
00:16:09.410 --> 00:16:13.010
<v Speaker 1>double dewberry license,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the salts,</v>

293
00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:15.193
<v Speaker 1>and there are a significant number of </v>
<v Speaker 1>false friends between French and </v>

294
00:16:17.781 --> 00:16:18.614
<v Speaker 1>English.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Words that look the same but actually </v>

295
00:16:19.941 --> 00:16:21.980
<v Speaker 1>mean something else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

296
00:16:22.250 --> 00:16:27.250
<v Speaker 1>actually actually more active and more </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't mean actually it means currently</v>

297
00:16:27.680 --> 00:16:32.600
<v Speaker 1>or right now assist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>assisting a sea state means to attend.</v>

298
00:16:33.150 --> 00:16:37.910
<v Speaker 1>Then there's attend at dawn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A thumper doesn't mean to attempt.</v>

299
00:16:37.940 --> 00:16:38.773
<v Speaker 1>It means to wait.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are quite a lot of false friends </v>

300
00:16:40.791 --> 00:16:41.624
<v Speaker 1>like this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you can never assume that a French </v>

301
00:16:42.921 --> 00:16:45.710
<v Speaker 1>word has the same meaning as a similar </v>
<v Speaker 1>looking English word.</v>

302
00:16:46.880 --> 00:16:49.880
<v Speaker 1>Now let's look at one final sentence and</v>
<v Speaker 1>see what we find.</v>

303
00:16:50.180 --> 00:16:51.013
<v Speaker 1>Here's the sentence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning she went for a walk to the park </v>

304
00:16:52.941 --> 00:16:55.450
<v Speaker 1>yesterday and sip on Neil back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

305
00:16:55.850 --> 00:16:56.683
<v Speaker 1>word for word.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's she herself took for a walk to the </v>

306
00:16:59.331 --> 00:17:02.420
<v Speaker 1>park yesterday.</v>
<v Speaker 1>L is the third person.</v>

307
00:17:02.421 --> 00:17:03.710
<v Speaker 1>Feminine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Singular Pronouns.</v>

308
00:17:03.980 --> 00:17:07.280
<v Speaker 1>Next we have the verb phrase and this </v>
<v Speaker 1>year as a reflexive verb,</v>

309
00:17:07.520 --> 00:17:10.700
<v Speaker 1>sip is the third person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pronouns used for reflexives.</v>

310
00:17:10.760 --> 00:17:14.270
<v Speaker 1>It means herself or himself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Next we have the third person,</v>

311
00:17:14.271 --> 00:17:15.104
<v Speaker 1>singular present tense form of Ed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is used as the auxiliary verb for </v>

312
00:17:18.381 --> 00:17:19.214
<v Speaker 1>the passe composite for reflexive verbs </v>
<v Speaker 1>come [inaudible] is the past participle </v>

313
00:17:23.571 --> 00:17:26.090
<v Speaker 1>of the main verb.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the feminine singular form,</v>

314
00:17:26.091 --> 00:17:28.850
<v Speaker 1>which takes an extra e at the end by </v>
<v Speaker 1>itself.</v>

315
00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:31.520
<v Speaker 1>It's a transitive verb,</v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning to take for a walk,</v>

316
00:17:31.550 --> 00:17:34.490
<v Speaker 1>but the reflexive form used here means </v>
<v Speaker 1>to go for a walk.</v>

317
00:17:35.060 --> 00:17:38.930
<v Speaker 1>Here we have a preposition meaning to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the two by itself is ah,</v>

318
00:17:39.080 --> 00:17:42.140
<v Speaker 1>but when used before the masculine </v>
<v Speaker 1>singular definite article,</v>

319
00:17:42.200 --> 00:17:43.850
<v Speaker 1>they are replaced by bull.</v>

320
00:17:43.910 --> 00:17:44.743
<v Speaker 1>For Feminine Singular,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would be alive and for plural it </v>

321
00:17:47.421 --> 00:17:50.790
<v Speaker 1>would be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh fuck is the noun meeting park.</v>

322
00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:55.620
<v Speaker 1>So this whole phrase means to the park.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes is the advert meaning yesterday.</v>

323
00:17:56.700 --> 00:17:57.533
<v Speaker 1>As you can see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>French is a very interesting language </v>

324
00:17:59.220 --> 00:18:01.500
<v Speaker 1>for speakers of English or romance </v>
<v Speaker 1>languages.</v>

325
00:18:01.650 --> 00:18:04.710
<v Speaker 1>There are probably many elements of </v>
<v Speaker 1>French that seemed familiar,</v>

326
00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:07.200
<v Speaker 1>but then when you get into the details </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the language,</v>

327
00:18:07.230 --> 00:18:10.170
<v Speaker 1>there might be aspects that seem complex</v>
<v Speaker 1>or challenging,</v>

328
00:18:10.560 --> 00:18:14.040
<v Speaker 1>but French is a highly rewarding </v>
<v Speaker 1>language and by learning French you will</v>

329
00:18:14.041 --> 00:18:16.560
<v Speaker 1>not only be able to communicate with </v>
<v Speaker 1>French speakers,</v>

330
00:18:16.561 --> 00:18:20.400
<v Speaker 1>but you will also open the door to a </v>
<v Speaker 1>whole new world of culture,</v>

331
00:18:20.460 --> 00:18:21.660
<v Speaker 1>literature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cinema,</v>

332
00:18:21.661 --> 00:18:22.494
<v Speaker 1>and history.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The question of the day for native </v>

333
00:18:24.721 --> 00:18:25.554
<v Speaker 1>speakers of French.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In this video I focused mainly on </v>

334
00:18:27.661 --> 00:18:29.250
<v Speaker 1>standard Parisian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>French,</v>

335
00:18:29.340 --> 00:18:31.500
<v Speaker 1>but what regional differences are you </v>
<v Speaker 1>aware of?</v>

336
00:18:31.740 --> 00:18:34.320
<v Speaker 1>Are there any differences in the French </v>
<v Speaker 1>spoken at Belgium,</v>

337
00:18:34.321 --> 00:18:35.520
<v Speaker 1>Switzerland,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Quebec,</v>

338
00:18:35.550 --> 00:18:37.680
<v Speaker 1>et Cetera,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and for learners of French?</v>

339
00:18:37.710 --> 00:18:38.543
<v Speaker 1>What aspects of French have you found </v>
<v Speaker 1>challenging and how have you dealt with </v>

340
00:18:41.131 --> 00:18:41.964
<v Speaker 1>those challenges?</v>
