1
00:00:00.970 --> 00:00:04.340
<v Speaker 1>Can I Hebrew speaker understand an </v>
<v Speaker 1>Arabic speaker?</v>

2
00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:06.770
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the short answer is no.</v>

3
00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:12.230
<v Speaker 1>The long answer is Kinda sorta maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not really.</v>

4
00:00:12.231 --> 00:00:13.064
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

5
00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:19.390
<v Speaker 2>The question,</v>

6
00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:20.223
<v Speaker 1>one of the day is how similar our Hebrew</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Arabic as someone who has studied </v>

7
00:00:24.881 --> 00:00:28.300
<v Speaker 1>both languages,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get asked this question by quite a few</v>

8
00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:29.133
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

9
00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:30.083
<v Speaker 1>and it's a good question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It makes me think because I'm not quite </v>

10
00:00:32.021 --> 00:00:34.960
<v Speaker 1>sure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'll give you my best answer.</v>

11
00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:36.093
<v Speaker 1>Basically Hebrew and Arabic are very </v>
<v Speaker 1>closely related languages and if you </v>

12
00:00:40.271 --> 00:00:42.280
<v Speaker 1>study both,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that will become very apparent.</v>

13
00:00:42.281 --> 00:00:45.940
<v Speaker 1>You'll see tons of similarities and if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you know one well already,</v>

14
00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:48.490
<v Speaker 1>that will help you learn the other much </v>
<v Speaker 1>more easily,</v>

15
00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:53.350
<v Speaker 1>but at the same time they are not </v>
<v Speaker 1>mutually comprehensible.</v>

16
00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:54.710
<v Speaker 1>That means,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

17
00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:57.190
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you speak one and not the other,</v>

18
00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:58.293
<v Speaker 1>that you won't be able to communicate </v>
<v Speaker 1>with someone who speaks the other </v>

19
00:01:01.361 --> 00:01:02.590
<v Speaker 1>language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they're not,</v>

20
00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:03.693
<v Speaker 1>you can't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't communicate as though they're </v>

21
00:01:05.351 --> 00:01:07.570
<v Speaker 1>the same language and won't work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

22
00:01:07.571 --> 00:01:08.404
<v Speaker 1>So let's talk about some things that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of similar and I'll throw in some </v>

23
00:01:10.901 --> 00:01:12.160
<v Speaker 1>differences as I go.</v>

24
00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:13.173
<v Speaker 1>And then I'll talk about how there are </v>
<v Speaker 1>not really useful as a communication </v>

25
00:01:17.891 --> 00:01:19.890
<v Speaker 1>tool with each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

26
00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:20.733
<v Speaker 1>So they're similar because of the verbal</v>
<v Speaker 1>system and in terms of how you create </v>

27
00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.830
<v Speaker 1>words in the language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in both Hebrew and Arabic,</v>

28
00:01:28.831 --> 00:01:29.664
<v Speaker 1>they have a system of roots.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now those roots are usually three </v>

29
00:01:33.661 --> 00:01:38.520
<v Speaker 1>consonant letters and you take those </v>
<v Speaker 1>three consonant letters and you put them</v>

30
00:01:38.521 --> 00:01:41.190
<v Speaker 1>into kind of templates that help you </v>
<v Speaker 1>create a word.</v>

31
00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.640
<v Speaker 1>So the templates are patterns.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>

32
00:01:43.641 --> 00:01:45.060
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a set of,</v>

33
00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:50.450
<v Speaker 1>of a combination of vowels and ethics is</v>
<v Speaker 1>that could be a prefix or suffix or even</v>

34
00:01:51.701 --> 00:01:52.534
<v Speaker 1>an in fix inside the word.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's take a three letter root and </v>

35
00:01:55.741 --> 00:01:57.480
<v Speaker 1>I'll give you an example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In Hebrew,</v>

36
00:01:57.481 --> 00:02:01.070
<v Speaker 1>you've got the root ca to va,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's Katie v.</v>

37
00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.590
<v Speaker 1>If you recognize it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and in Arabic you've got to book Katie,</v>

38
00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:07.440
<v Speaker 1>be romanized it already.</v>

39
00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:10.710
<v Speaker 1>You can see there's a similarity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That route is almost the same.</v>

40
00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:14.400
<v Speaker 1>The book and the va are different,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but low sounds are equivalent.</v>

41
00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:17.490
<v Speaker 1>So if you put them into the templates,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can change it.</v>

42
00:02:17.491 --> 00:02:20.730
<v Speaker 1>Let's use a verb conjugation template in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the past tense.</v>

43
00:02:20.731 --> 00:02:23.280
<v Speaker 1>This is the simplest structure in both </v>
<v Speaker 1>languages.</v>

44
00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:24.690
<v Speaker 1>So in Hebrew,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you say,</v>

45
00:02:24.691 --> 00:02:25.524
<v Speaker 1>I wrote,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you would say cut off d in Arabic you </v>

46
00:02:28.201 --> 00:02:29.034
<v Speaker 1>would say the top two or in a dialect </v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe cut up in Hebrew for the second </v>

47
00:02:34.681 --> 00:02:36.780
<v Speaker 1>person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>masculine for you,</v>

48
00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:40.040
<v Speaker 1>you would say a cutoff in Arabic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cut Up top.</v>

49
00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:41.273
<v Speaker 1>So you can see that's quite similar for </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Feminine Second Person Singular in </v>

50
00:02:46.201 --> 00:02:50.040
<v Speaker 1>Hebrew,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you would say cutoff in Arabic,</v>

51
00:02:50.041 --> 00:02:52.190
<v Speaker 1>you would say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

52
00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:53.063
<v Speaker 1>so you could see there there's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>similarity here in the way that you put </v>

53
00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:59.890
<v Speaker 1>the roots into these templates to </v>
<v Speaker 1>conjugate the verbs and you can see that</v>

54
00:02:59.891 --> 00:03:02.580
<v Speaker 1>the conjugations are kind of similar.</v>

55
00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:03.493
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the templates are kind of similar but </v>

56
00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:07.780
<v Speaker 1>they're not exactly the same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there could be confusion like,</v>

57
00:03:07.781 --> 00:03:09.130
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for uh,</v>

58
00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:14.370
<v Speaker 1>for the one I said for a in Hebrew,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's cutoff date that I wrote,</v>

59
00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:20.230
<v Speaker 1>but in Arabic means you wrote,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's when spoken to a female.</v>

60
00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:21.333
<v Speaker 1>So you can see there could be a </v>
<v Speaker 1>confusion there and you might </v>

61
00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:24.333
<v Speaker 1>misunderstand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they're talking about someone </v>

62
00:03:25.721 --> 00:03:28.000
<v Speaker 1>else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm right.</v>

63
00:03:28.001 --> 00:03:28.834
<v Speaker 1>But she could see that same kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>system and that that kind of system of </v>

64
00:03:31.871 --> 00:03:34.510
<v Speaker 1>templates is used to create nouns to </v>
<v Speaker 1>create adjectives,</v>

65
00:03:34.511 --> 00:03:35.344
<v Speaker 1>all kinds of words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just the templates are different and </v>

66
00:03:37.181 --> 00:03:41.710
<v Speaker 1>have different affixes attached to them </v>
<v Speaker 1>and different vowels.</v>

67
00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:44.650
<v Speaker 1>So that's one thing is that system of </v>
<v Speaker 1>roots and templates,</v>

68
00:03:44.651 --> 00:03:45.484
<v Speaker 1>it's the same in both.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you learn that once for one </v>

69
00:03:47.321 --> 00:03:48.154
<v Speaker 1>language,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just getting that concept down </v>

70
00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:51.153
<v Speaker 1>really helps you with the second </v>
<v Speaker 1>language that uses that same system </v>

71
00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:54.453
<v Speaker 1>because it's a bit mind bending at first</v>
<v Speaker 1>to adjust to that route and template </v>

72
00:03:57.791 --> 00:03:58.624
<v Speaker 1>system.</v>

73
00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:02.170
<v Speaker 1>Another way that there are similar is in</v>
<v Speaker 1>terms of just a lot of vocabulary,</v>

74
00:04:02.171 --> 00:04:04.990
<v Speaker 1>you already saw that that one route,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the cut,</v>

75
00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:05.833
<v Speaker 1>the cut the book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's a lot of vocabulary that's </v>

76
00:04:08.111 --> 00:04:09.970
<v Speaker 1>the same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not the majority of words though.</v>

77
00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:12.520
<v Speaker 1>It's not like 80 percent or something </v>
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>

78
00:04:12.521 --> 00:04:13.354
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would,</v>

79
00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:14.403
<v Speaker 1>I don't know the exact percentage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would guess that it's about a third </v>

80
00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:22.120
<v Speaker 1>that's just off the top of my head from </v>
<v Speaker 1>my studying experience.</v>

81
00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:23.480
<v Speaker 1>A third,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

82
00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:26.710
<v Speaker 1>some of the words are very similar or </v>
<v Speaker 1>almost the same.</v>

83
00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:30.880
<v Speaker 1>And some are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some are clearly related,</v>

84
00:04:30.881 --> 00:04:31.714
<v Speaker 1>if you examine the words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you might not notice that just from </v>

85
00:04:34.871 --> 00:04:35.704
<v Speaker 1>hearing them because the phonology of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the languages has become different due </v>

86
00:04:39.611 --> 00:04:43.690
<v Speaker 1>to the languages history.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's similar in French and Italian,</v>

87
00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:46.120
<v Speaker 1>French and Italian.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you read two sentences,</v>

88
00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:47.950
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>equivalent centers,</v>

89
00:04:47.951 --> 00:04:50.410
<v Speaker 1>this side by side,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can look at them and you can say,</v>

90
00:04:50.411 --> 00:04:52.660
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this word must be the same as this word.</v>

91
00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:56.680
<v Speaker 1>This one must be the same as this one </v>
<v Speaker 1>because the words look kind of similar.</v>

92
00:04:56.681 --> 00:04:58.780
<v Speaker 1>They sound different and the spelling is</v>
<v Speaker 1>different.</v>

93
00:04:58.781 --> 00:05:00.790
<v Speaker 1>But you can look at them and see that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're the same.</v>

94
00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:03.370
<v Speaker 1>They have the same meaning because they </v>
<v Speaker 1>look similar.</v>

95
00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:05.110
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so there are a lot of words like that,</v>

96
00:05:05.111 --> 00:05:08.320
<v Speaker 1>like they're the kind of cognates,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're slightly different.</v>

97
00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:09.753
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'll give you some examples of both </v>

98
00:05:11.201 --> 00:05:12.790
<v Speaker 1>types.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the ones that are very similar,</v>

99
00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:13.653
<v Speaker 1>a yad in Hebrew and Arabic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that means hand dumb in Hebrew and </v>

100
00:05:18.251 --> 00:05:20.090
<v Speaker 1>Arabic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That means blood,</v>

101
00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:21.400
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

102
00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:23.950
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of words that are similar </v>
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>

103
00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:25.630
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>
<v Speaker 1>almost the same like that.</v>

104
00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:28.510
<v Speaker 1>Some that you can figure out quite </v>
<v Speaker 1>easily with the pronouns,</v>

105
00:05:28.511 --> 00:05:33.511
<v Speaker 1>like I is an the in Hebrew or in Arabic </v>
<v Speaker 1>or in Hebrew,</v>

106
00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:37.920
<v Speaker 1>you for a man as a ta in Arabic gets </v>
<v Speaker 1>untaught,</v>

107
00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:39.093
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

108
00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:43.420
<v Speaker 1>He is who in Hebrew,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's in Arabic,</v>

109
00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:44.620
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

110
00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:46.570
<v Speaker 1>and that might,</v>
<v Speaker 1>might depend on the dialect to,</v>

111
00:05:46.571 --> 00:05:49.300
<v Speaker 1>in Arabic is different in from country </v>
<v Speaker 1>to country.</v>

112
00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:54.720
<v Speaker 1>Another one kitchen in Hebrew Mitzvah </v>
<v Speaker 1>and in Arabic gets macbook.</v>

113
00:05:57.050 --> 00:05:57.883
<v Speaker 1>So pretty close.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just one vowel changes in the Arabic </v>

114
00:06:00.351 --> 00:06:01.320
<v Speaker 1>one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

115
00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:03.260
<v Speaker 1>some that are a little bit more </v>
<v Speaker 1>different,</v>

116
00:06:03.261 --> 00:06:04.094
<v Speaker 1>but you can see the similarity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if you know the function or </v>

117
00:06:06.111 --> 00:06:06.944
<v Speaker 1>meaning of the word,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like this one to you or for you in </v>

118
00:06:10.011 --> 00:06:12.470
<v Speaker 1>Hebrew is the hot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But in Arabic it's lack.</v>

119
00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:14.570
<v Speaker 1>So if you look at the vowels,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sorry,</v>

120
00:06:14.571 --> 00:06:15.950
<v Speaker 1>if you look at the consonants you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>see,</v>

121
00:06:15.951 --> 00:06:17.780
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>l k versus l,</v>

122
00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:20.420
<v Speaker 1>C h,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those might be the same,</v>

123
00:06:20.421 --> 00:06:25.370
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of in Hebrew is father Abba in Arabic.</v>

124
00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:27.010
<v Speaker 1>So again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see that be in the V,</v>

125
00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:29.180
<v Speaker 1>another one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ben,</v>

126
00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:32.540
<v Speaker 1>his son in Hebrew Eban his son in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Arabic.</v>

127
00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:34.850
<v Speaker 1>So if you just look at the consonants </v>
<v Speaker 1>that be in the end,</v>

128
00:06:34.851 --> 00:06:35.570
<v Speaker 1>you can say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

129
00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:37.820
<v Speaker 1>those are related.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Another one,</v>

130
00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.000
<v Speaker 1>rush,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rush means head in Hebrew,</v>

131
00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:44.300
<v Speaker 1>and last,</v>
<v Speaker 1>last means head in Arabic.</v>

132
00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:46.970
<v Speaker 1>So that's in rush.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are clearly related.</v>

133
00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:49.010
<v Speaker 1>Another one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tongue in Hebrew,</v>

134
00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:51.620
<v Speaker 1>lashawn in Arabic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Listen,</v>

135
00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:54.110
<v Speaker 1>the sun,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the sun and the show,</v>

136
00:06:54.530 --> 00:06:56.550
<v Speaker 1>maybe there's a change there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And also the,</v>

137
00:06:56.551 --> 00:06:57.384
<v Speaker 1>the old became an r sound.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's some shifts in the sounds </v>

138
00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:03.380
<v Speaker 1>going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dog in Hebrew is Kelly in Arabic,</v>

139
00:07:03.381 --> 00:07:04.214
<v Speaker 1>it's called.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you can see there are a lot of words </v>

140
00:07:06.171 --> 00:07:10.070
<v Speaker 1>that have a similar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a similar route or if they come from the</v>

141
00:07:10.071 --> 00:07:10.904
<v Speaker 1>same word,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they've shifted and become </v>

142
00:07:11.841 --> 00:07:14.360
<v Speaker 1>different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's a lot of words like that that</v>

143
00:07:14.361 --> 00:07:16.670
<v Speaker 1>you wouldn't necessarily understand when</v>
<v Speaker 1>you hear them.</v>

144
00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:18.400
<v Speaker 1>And other one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's this,</v>

145
00:07:18.470 --> 00:07:20.000
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are some words that are the same,</v>

146
00:07:20.001 --> 00:07:23.390
<v Speaker 1>but they have a different meaning like a</v>
<v Speaker 1>Medina or Medina.</v>

147
00:07:23.780 --> 00:07:27.620
<v Speaker 1>In Hebrew,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Medina is state like Israel,</v>

148
00:07:27.621 --> 00:07:30.800
<v Speaker 1>the state of Israel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But in Arabic Medina means a city.</v>

149
00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:34.490
<v Speaker 1>So they're both political entities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is a connection in the meaning,</v>

150
00:07:34.491 --> 00:07:37.790
<v Speaker 1>but it's not exactly the same,</v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning the meaning has become different</v>

151
00:07:39.110 --> 00:07:42.890
<v Speaker 1>and they're also a lot of words that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>just different entirely.</v>

152
00:07:42.891 --> 00:07:43.724
<v Speaker 1>For whatever reason.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's always kind of strange to discover </v>

153
00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:48.680
<v Speaker 1>words that are exactly the same in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Hebrew and Arabic.</v>

154
00:07:48.681 --> 00:07:49.514
<v Speaker 1>And then the next word in the sentence </v>
<v Speaker 1>is entirely different and you've never </v>

155
00:07:52.101 --> 00:07:55.550
<v Speaker 1>seen it before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like why did this one become the same</v>

156
00:07:55.551 --> 00:07:57.560
<v Speaker 1>in both languages,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this one is different.</v>

157
00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.170
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it makes it kind of interesting.</v>

158
00:08:00.171 --> 00:08:02.420
<v Speaker 1>I don't always know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You usually don't know the answer,</v>

159
00:08:02.421 --> 00:08:03.920
<v Speaker 1>but yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>

160
00:08:03.921 --> 00:08:08.600
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of different vocabulary so</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can see that there are quite related</v>

161
00:08:08.780 --> 00:08:09.613
<v Speaker 1>and there's a lot of crossover but you </v>
<v Speaker 1>won't understand one just by learning </v>

162
00:08:15.410 --> 00:08:16.243
<v Speaker 1>the other.</v>

163
00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:18.620
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It will help you learn the other.</v>

164
00:08:18.621 --> 00:08:19.454
<v Speaker 1>If you make the effort though and if you</v>
<v Speaker 1>take what you know and try to apply it </v>

165
00:08:23.001 --> 00:08:24.740
<v Speaker 1>to the other language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well learning.</v>

166
00:08:24.770 --> 00:08:29.630
<v Speaker 1>So let me give you an example of when I </v>
<v Speaker 1>first went to Egypt in 1997.</v>

167
00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:30.913
<v Speaker 1>I went there after having studied Hebrew</v>
<v Speaker 1>for a couple of years already and I was </v>

168
00:08:33.890 --> 00:08:38.890
<v Speaker 1>visiting Israel and I went to Egypt to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I tried to use my Hebrew and apply it</v>

169
00:08:39.741 --> 00:08:42.590
<v Speaker 1>to Arabic because I only knew a little </v>
<v Speaker 1>bit of Arabic.</v>

170
00:08:42.591 --> 00:08:46.130
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know enough to really to have a</v>
<v Speaker 1>conversation or whatever.</v>

171
00:08:46.310 --> 00:08:50.990
<v Speaker 1>So I would try to use my very simple </v>
<v Speaker 1>Arabic and insert Hebrew words into it.</v>

172
00:08:51.350 --> 00:08:56.100
<v Speaker 1>And I knew the difference in phonology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I would kind of shift in Arab buys my</v>

173
00:08:56.101 --> 00:08:56.934
<v Speaker 1>pronunciation of the Hebrew words.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was surprised by how often people </v>

174
00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:04.770
<v Speaker 1>understood me and the people didn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>speak Hebrew.</v>

175
00:09:04.770 --> 00:09:06.900
<v Speaker 1>They weren't seen bruce speakers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they understood,</v>

176
00:09:07.170 --> 00:09:10.530
<v Speaker 1>I guess they could,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they could hear the word and think of an</v>

177
00:09:10.531 --> 00:09:11.364
<v Speaker 1>equivalent or similar sounding word in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Arabic or they could cure the root and </v>

178
00:09:14.821 --> 00:09:17.700
<v Speaker 1>maybe that route was used in a different</v>
<v Speaker 1>word in there,</v>

179
00:09:17.910 --> 00:09:20.010
<v Speaker 1>Arabic dialect or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

180
00:09:20.011 --> 00:09:22.350
<v Speaker 1>so they could figure out what I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>saying a lot of the time.</v>

181
00:09:22.590 --> 00:09:23.423
<v Speaker 1>And they looked at me strangely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They thought maybe I was a Weirdo or I </v>

182
00:09:27.421 --> 00:09:30.330
<v Speaker 1>remember they often asked me if I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>from Lebanon,</v>

183
00:09:30.900 --> 00:09:31.733
<v Speaker 1>so maybe they thought that my bizarre </v>
<v Speaker 1>Arabic pigeon language was Lebanese </v>

184
00:09:36.451 --> 00:09:38.580
<v Speaker 1>Arabic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That seemed to be something like that.</v>

185
00:09:38.581 --> 00:09:40.290
<v Speaker 1>They kept asking me if I was from </v>
<v Speaker 1>Lebanon.</v>

186
00:09:40.850 --> 00:09:43.170
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it happened like that in Jordan too.</v>

187
00:09:43.290 --> 00:09:46.050
<v Speaker 1>I remember when I was in Jordan the same</v>
<v Speaker 1>year,</v>

188
00:09:46.580 --> 00:09:48.990
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I,</v>

189
00:09:49.130 --> 00:09:54.130
<v Speaker 1>I managed to use some Hebrew words in </v>
<v Speaker 1>situations where I was surprised that it</v>

190
00:09:54.690 --> 00:09:55.260
<v Speaker 1>went across.</v>

191
00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:58.530
<v Speaker 1>So they understood a lot of my Hebrew </v>
<v Speaker 1>words when I era buys them.</v>

192
00:09:59.070 --> 00:10:02.880
<v Speaker 1>So that's just an example of how the </v>
<v Speaker 1>language has crossover and you,</v>

193
00:10:02.980 --> 00:10:03.813
<v Speaker 1>you can apply one to the other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're generally not mutually </v>

194
00:10:07.351 --> 00:10:08.184
<v Speaker 1>comprehensible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to make the effort to shift it </v>

195
00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:13.110
<v Speaker 1>to change that knowledge into the other </v>
<v Speaker 1>language.</v>

196
00:10:13.620 --> 00:10:15.600
<v Speaker 1>So that's why there are two different </v>
<v Speaker 1>languages,</v>

197
00:10:15.601 --> 00:10:18.870
<v Speaker 1>not dialects of the same language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

198
00:10:18.871 --> 00:10:21.450
<v Speaker 1>So that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what I wanted to share with you.</v>

199
00:10:21.510 --> 00:10:23.610
<v Speaker 1>Just my experience with how similar they</v>
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>

200
00:10:23.940 --> 00:10:25.680
<v Speaker 1>give you some similarities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>differences,</v>

201
00:10:25.681 --> 00:10:28.860
<v Speaker 1>and hope you understand a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 1>better than before.</v>

202
00:10:29.090 --> 00:10:30.450
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank you for listening.</v>

203
00:10:30.451 --> 00:10:31.284
<v Speaker 1>Good Nights.</v>
