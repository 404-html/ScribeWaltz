00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:12.453
<v Speaker 1>Hello everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Today we're going to focus on the </v>

2
00:00:14.291 --> 00:00:15.124
<v Speaker 1>languages of Singapore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Singapore has one of the few remaining </v>

3
00:00:18.311 --> 00:00:19.144
<v Speaker 1>city states in the world located in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Southeast Asia at the tip of the Malay </v>

4
00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:24.363
<v Speaker 1>Peninsula.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The archipelago that makes up Singapore </v>

5
00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:28.270
<v Speaker 1>is just a stone's throw away from </v>
<v Speaker 1>peninsular.</v>

6
00:00:28.271 --> 00:00:31.450
<v Speaker 1>Malaysia separated from it by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>streets of Johor.</v>

7
00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:34.740
<v Speaker 1>Despite being one of the smallest </v>
<v Speaker 1>countries in the world.</v>

8
00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:35.623
<v Speaker 1>Singapore is a culturally and </v>
<v Speaker 1>linguistically diverse place and as one </v>

9
00:00:38.861 --> 00:00:40.840
<v Speaker 1>of the world's leading financial </v>
<v Speaker 1>centers,</v>

10
00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:44.950
<v Speaker 1>it continues to attract immigrants and </v>
<v Speaker 1>ex patriots from around the world.</v>

11
00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:46.053
<v Speaker 1>Singapore was originally a molay trading</v>
<v Speaker 1>port called Tomasek around the 14th </v>

12
00:00:49.811 --> 00:00:52.540
<v Speaker 1>century and later became known as single</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pooda.</v>

13
00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:53.703
<v Speaker 1>It eventually fell into obscurity until </v>
<v Speaker 1>it was established as a British trading </v>

14
00:00:57.101 --> 00:01:02.101
<v Speaker 1>colony in 1819 from 1963 to 1965 </v>
<v Speaker 1>Singapore briefly became part of the new</v>

15
00:01:03.671 --> 00:01:04.504
<v Speaker 1>federation of Malaysia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was formed from former British </v>

16
00:01:06.911 --> 00:01:07.960
<v Speaker 1>colonies in the region.</v>

17
00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:12.280
<v Speaker 1>It then became independent in 1965 while</v>
<v Speaker 1>under British rule,</v>

18
00:01:12.281 --> 00:01:13.114
<v Speaker 1>Singapore had a free trade policy which </v>
<v Speaker 1>attracted Chinese traders and laborers </v>

19
00:01:16.691 --> 00:01:17.524
<v Speaker 1>from Malaysia and China and Chinese grew</v>
<v Speaker 1>to become the majority of the </v>

20
00:01:20.531 --> 00:01:22.240
<v Speaker 1>population.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Also,</v>

21
00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:25.630
<v Speaker 1>Singapore and India were under British </v>
<v Speaker 1>rule at the same time,</v>

22
00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:28.210
<v Speaker 1>which led to a flow of migrants from </v>
<v Speaker 1>India.</v>

23
00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:30.910
<v Speaker 1>Today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and for most of Singapore's history,</v>

24
00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:31.803
<v Speaker 1>ethnic Indians have formed the third </v>
<v Speaker 1>largest ethnic group in Singapore after </v>

25
00:01:35.261 --> 00:01:36.094
<v Speaker 1>Chinese and malaise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Singapore has four official languages </v>

26
00:01:38.801 --> 00:01:39.634
<v Speaker 1>that were chosen to represent the </v>
<v Speaker 1>largest ethnic groups in the country at </v>

27
00:01:42.671 --> 00:01:44.530
<v Speaker 1>the time that the constitution was </v>
<v Speaker 1>written.</v>

28
00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:45.603
<v Speaker 1>First English,</v>
<v Speaker 1>due to Singapore's history as a British </v>

29
00:01:47.951 --> 00:01:48.784
<v Speaker 1>colony,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mandarin Chinese to unite the large </v>

30
00:01:50.891 --> 00:01:51.724
<v Speaker 1>Chinese population molay which doubles </v>
<v Speaker 1>as the national language of Singapore </v>

31
00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:56.283
<v Speaker 1>because it's the language of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>indigenous population and Tamil to </v>

32
00:01:58.961 --> 00:02:03.280
<v Speaker 1>represent the Indian population of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Singapore on an administrative level.</v>

33
00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:06.250
<v Speaker 1>The unofficial Lingua Franca of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>country is English,</v>

34
00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:09.490
<v Speaker 1>and it serves as the main language of </v>
<v Speaker 1>instruction in schools.</v>

35
00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:12.640
<v Speaker 1>The language of the justice system and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the language of business.</v>

36
00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:13.653
<v Speaker 1>The vast majority of Singapore ends are </v>
<v Speaker 1>bilingual as a result of the country's </v>

37
00:02:16.961 --> 00:02:17.794
<v Speaker 1>education policy with 73.2%</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the population identifying as </v>

38
00:02:22.031 --> 00:02:26.320
<v Speaker 1>bilingual or multilingual.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All Singaporeans are now mainly educated</v>

39
00:02:26.321 --> 00:02:27.154
<v Speaker 1>in English,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're also required to take </v>

40
00:02:28.661 --> 00:02:29.494
<v Speaker 1>courses in the mother tongue that </v>
<v Speaker 1>corresponds to their ethnic background </v>

41
00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:33.843
<v Speaker 1>that so-called mother tongue doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>necessarily correspond to the student's </v>

42
00:02:36.941 --> 00:02:40.570
<v Speaker 1>native language and it's better to think</v>
<v Speaker 1>of it as a heritage language.</v>

43
00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:44.350
<v Speaker 1>Mandarin is the mother tongue assigned </v>
<v Speaker 1>to students of Chinese background,</v>

44
00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:45.273
<v Speaker 1>even though the students family might </v>
<v Speaker 1>use a different Chinese language or </v>

45
00:02:47.711 --> 00:02:49.390
<v Speaker 1>English at home.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Similarly,</v>

46
00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:51.220
<v Speaker 1>Tamil is the mother tongue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a scientist,</v>

47
00:02:51.221 --> 00:02:52.054
<v Speaker 1>students of Indian background,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though they may speak a different </v>

48
00:02:54.341 --> 00:02:55.174
<v Speaker 1>Indian language or English at home and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Molay is the mother tongue assigned to </v>

49
00:02:58.751 --> 00:02:59.584
<v Speaker 1>students molay background,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though some may speak English or </v>

50
00:03:02.381 --> 00:03:03.490
<v Speaker 1>another language at home.</v>

51
00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:04.713
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's take a look at each of the four </v>

52
00:03:05.741 --> 00:03:07.510
<v Speaker 1>official languages.</v>
<v Speaker 1>English,</v>

53
00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:08.673
<v Speaker 1>the official language most commonly </v>
<v Speaker 1>spoken at home is English with </v>

54
00:03:11.441 --> 00:03:12.274
<v Speaker 1>approximately 36.9%</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the resident population speaking it </v>

55
00:03:16.031 --> 00:03:18.670
<v Speaker 1>as their first language with the rest of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the population.</v>

56
00:03:18.671 --> 00:03:19.504
<v Speaker 1>Having some level of fluency.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are very few Singaporeans who </v>

57
00:03:22.181 --> 00:03:24.940
<v Speaker 1>speak no English and amongst the younger</v>
<v Speaker 1>generation,</v>

58
00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:25.803
<v Speaker 1>basically everybody speaks it fluently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>English was made the main language of </v>

59
00:03:29.351 --> 00:03:34.090
<v Speaker 1>school instruction in all government </v>
<v Speaker 1>schools beginning in 1987 before that,</v>

60
00:03:34.091 --> 00:03:37.450
<v Speaker 1>different schools offered instruction in</v>
<v Speaker 1>different mother tongues,</v>

61
00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:38.583
<v Speaker 1>immigrants and ex pats aside.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are two basic forms of English </v>

62
00:03:41.261 --> 00:03:43.830
<v Speaker 1>that are used in Singapore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First standards,</v>

63
00:03:43.831 --> 00:03:44.664
<v Speaker 1>Singaporean English,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is based on the conventions of </v>

64
00:03:46.691 --> 00:03:47.524
<v Speaker 1>British English,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's spoken with a uniquely </v>

65
00:03:49.061 --> 00:03:49.894
<v Speaker 1>Singaporean accent and an English creole</v>
<v Speaker 1>known academically as colloquial </v>

66
00:03:53.741 --> 00:03:57.220
<v Speaker 1>Singaporean English and more popularly </v>
<v Speaker 1>known as singlish.</v>

67
00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:58.293
<v Speaker 1>The standard form of the language is </v>
<v Speaker 1>highly promoted by the government of </v>

68
00:04:00.911 --> 00:04:01.744
<v Speaker 1>Singapore through state sponsored </v>
<v Speaker 1>programs such as the speak good English </v>

69
00:04:04.841 --> 00:04:08.680
<v Speaker 1>movement that was specifically started </v>
<v Speaker 1>in order to curb the use of English.</v>

70
00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:10.990
<v Speaker 1>But why do they care if people use </v>
<v Speaker 1>singlish?</v>

71
00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:12.003
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I suppose that's because they want </v>

72
00:04:12.881 --> 00:04:13.714
<v Speaker 1>people to use a form of English that can</v>
<v Speaker 1>successfully be used in academic and </v>

73
00:04:17.111 --> 00:04:17.944
<v Speaker 1>professional situations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But speaking singlish doesn't mean that </v>

74
00:04:20.471 --> 00:04:21.304
<v Speaker 1>you can't speak standard English.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Standard English and singlish exist </v>

75
00:04:24.341 --> 00:04:28.870
<v Speaker 1>along a socio elect continuum meaning </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the form of English used depends on</v>

76
00:04:28.871 --> 00:04:32.500
<v Speaker 1>the social context.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In the most formal situations people use</v>

77
00:04:32.501 --> 00:04:33.334
<v Speaker 1>standard English and in the most </v>
<v Speaker 1>informal situations they might use pure </v>

78
00:04:36.401 --> 00:04:37.234
<v Speaker 1>singlish and they often mix them to </v>
<v Speaker 1>varying degrees depending on the level </v>

79
00:04:40.331 --> 00:04:45.331
<v Speaker 1>of formality of the situation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Singlish is topic prominent like Chinese</v>

80
00:04:45.371 --> 00:04:46.204
<v Speaker 1>or Japanese and as such many sentences,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll begin by mentioning the topic of </v>

81
00:04:49.841 --> 00:04:50.674
<v Speaker 1>the sentence first.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Other noticeable features are that the </v>

82
00:04:52.601 --> 00:04:53.434
<v Speaker 1>use of the plural form of nouns as well </v>
<v Speaker 1>as articles and the verb to be are all </v>

83
00:04:57.221 --> 00:04:58.054
<v Speaker 1>optional and also the grammatical </v>
<v Speaker 1>subject can be dropped if it's clear </v>

84
00:05:01.271 --> 00:05:02.104
<v Speaker 1>from the context.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here are a couple of examples of </v>

85
00:05:04.301 --> 00:05:05.134
<v Speaker 1>singlish</v>

86
00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:07.960
<v Speaker 2>our drawings,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those impact how to pass</v>

87
00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:09.273
<v Speaker 1>and in standard English something like </v>
<v Speaker 1>how can we get good marks with such a </v>

88
00:05:12.191 --> 00:05:15.400
<v Speaker 1>simple drawing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In this sentence we see topic prominence</v>

89
00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:17.920
<v Speaker 1>with the topic placed at the beginning </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the sentence</v>

90
00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:19.970
<v Speaker 2>still got heading</v>

91
00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:23.060
<v Speaker 1>and in standard English I've still got a</v>
<v Speaker 1>headache.</v>

92
00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:24.073
<v Speaker 1>In this sentence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can see that the subject isn't </v>

93
00:05:25.731 --> 00:05:30.230
<v Speaker 1>included and there's also no auxiliary </v>
<v Speaker 1>verb and there's no indefinite article.</v>

94
00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:33.030
<v Speaker 2>The Nisha already law</v>

95
00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:35.790
<v Speaker 1>in this sentence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the subject isn't included,</v>

96
00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:36.743
<v Speaker 1>so you would only know who or what has </v>
<v Speaker 1>finished from the context of the </v>

97
00:05:39.541 --> 00:05:42.960
<v Speaker 1>previous sentences and notice the word </v>
<v Speaker 1>at the end of the sentence.</v>

98
00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:43.883
<v Speaker 1>La.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This word emphasizes a statement or </v>

99
00:05:45.751 --> 00:05:46.584
<v Speaker 1>assertion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are other similar words that show </v>

100
00:05:48.511 --> 00:05:51.270
<v Speaker 1>uncertainty or indicate that you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>asking a question.</v>

101
00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:55.530
<v Speaker 1>These words are borrowed from varieties </v>
<v Speaker 1>of Chinese like Hokkien and in fact,</v>

102
00:05:55.531 --> 00:05:58.820
<v Speaker 1>many of the features of singlish are in </v>
<v Speaker 1>those Chinese varieties.</v>

103
00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:02.880
<v Speaker 1>And one more example that you can rise </v>
<v Speaker 1>restaurant over there.</v>

104
00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:03.743
<v Speaker 1>See Bait the Kong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their food dye dye must try in standard </v>

105
00:06:08.011 --> 00:06:08.844
<v Speaker 1>English.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That chicken rice restaurant over there </v>

106
00:06:10.321 --> 00:06:12.630
<v Speaker 1>has amazingly good food.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've got to try it.</v>

107
00:06:12.631 --> 00:06:13.464
<v Speaker 1>If it's the last thing we do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this first sentence starts off like </v>

108
00:06:15.781 --> 00:06:18.450
<v Speaker 1>standard English,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then we see this phrase here,</v>

109
00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:19.313
<v Speaker 1>seabed topcon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Topcon is a phrase from Hokkien which </v>

110
00:06:21.571 --> 00:06:22.404
<v Speaker 1>means very good and CBA is an </v>
<v Speaker 1>intensifier with the somewhat grim </v>

111
00:06:25.651 --> 00:06:26.484
<v Speaker 1>etymology.</v>

112
00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:27.693
<v Speaker 1>In the second sentence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see the topic placed at the </v>

113
00:06:29.411 --> 00:06:30.244
<v Speaker 1>beginning again and there's no subject </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the sentence because it's clear from </v>

114
00:06:33.401 --> 00:06:37.410
<v Speaker 1>the context and then we have this unique</v>
<v Speaker 1>adverbial phrase die,</v>

115
00:06:37.411 --> 00:06:38.244
<v Speaker 1>die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even though the use of singlish is </v>

116
00:06:40.331 --> 00:06:41.164
<v Speaker 1>discouraged by the government,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't really mean that it's on </v>

117
00:06:43.211 --> 00:06:44.590
<v Speaker 1>the decline.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

118
00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:45.453
<v Speaker 1>to many people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>English has become a source of local </v>

119
00:06:47.351 --> 00:06:48.184
<v Speaker 1>pride and identity and just as there </v>
<v Speaker 1>have been attempts to stamp it out into </v>

120
00:06:51.311 --> 00:06:54.610
<v Speaker 1>diminish its use,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there has also been a significant amount</v>

121
00:06:54.611 --> 00:06:55.444
<v Speaker 1>of pushback from locals who want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>prevent it from disappearing completely </v>

122
00:06:59.080 --> 00:06:59.913
<v Speaker 1>mandarin after English.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The second most commonly used language </v>

123
00:07:03.131 --> 00:07:07.960
<v Speaker 1>at home is Mandarin Chinese,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is used by around 34.9%</v>

124
00:07:07.961 --> 00:07:10.450
<v Speaker 1>of the resident population as a first </v>
<v Speaker 1>language.</v>

125
00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:13.720
<v Speaker 1>But if we add to that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of the other varieties of Chinese,</v>

126
00:07:13.750 --> 00:07:17.380
<v Speaker 1>which are around 12.2%</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the population than Chinese,</v>

127
00:07:17.381 --> 00:07:19.900
<v Speaker 1>comprises the largest language group in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Singapore.</v>

128
00:07:20.050 --> 00:07:22.270
<v Speaker 1>But to be clear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a group of languages,</v>

129
00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:25.630
<v Speaker 1>not just one language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Before the Constitution of Singapore was</v>

130
00:07:25.631 --> 00:07:26.464
<v Speaker 1>written.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Both Mandarin and Hokkien functioned as </v>

131
00:07:28.271 --> 00:07:30.880
<v Speaker 1>Lingua Franca for the diverse Chinese </v>
<v Speaker 1>community.</v>

132
00:07:31.330 --> 00:07:32.163
<v Speaker 1>When the constitution was written in </v>
<v Speaker 1>1965 the government chose Mandarin in </v>

133
00:07:35.921 --> 00:07:36.754
<v Speaker 1>order to officially unite the population</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then in 1979 the government led by </v>

134
00:07:41.081 --> 00:07:41.914
<v Speaker 1>Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew started the </v>
<v Speaker 1>now annual speak Mandarin campaign to </v>

135
00:07:45.581 --> 00:07:46.414
<v Speaker 1>continuously promote the use and </v>
<v Speaker 1>learning of the language instead of </v>

136
00:07:49.091 --> 00:07:49.924
<v Speaker 1>other Chinese languages.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This has resulted in an increase in the </v>

137
00:07:52.391 --> 00:07:53.224
<v Speaker 1>number of mandarin speakers and a </v>
<v Speaker 1>decrease in the number of speakers of </v>

138
00:07:55.961 --> 00:07:56.794
<v Speaker 1>other Chinese languages and I guess that</v>
<v Speaker 1>was exactly the intention of that </v>

139
00:07:59.741 --> 00:08:00.574
<v Speaker 1>program.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The form of Mandarin used in Singapore </v>

140
00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:06.220
<v Speaker 1>very closely follows the conventions of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the mandarin used in China and Taiwan.</v>

141
00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:08.110
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just as with English,</v>

142
00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:09.033
<v Speaker 1>Mandarin and Singapore has not been able</v>
<v Speaker 1>to avoid the influence of other </v>

143
00:08:11.981 --> 00:08:16.270
<v Speaker 1>languages and has developed a socio </v>
<v Speaker 1>elekta continuum just as English has.</v>

144
00:08:16.450 --> 00:08:17.283
<v Speaker 1>On opposite ends of the spectrum,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have standard mandarin and sing </v>

145
00:08:20.441 --> 00:08:23.720
<v Speaker 1>Durham or colloquial Singaporean </v>
<v Speaker 1>mandarin sing.</v>

146
00:08:23.721 --> 00:08:27.850
<v Speaker 1>Dorin is a result of the wide adoption </v>
<v Speaker 1>of Mandarin by speakers of other Chinese</v>

147
00:08:27.851 --> 00:08:30.640
<v Speaker 1>languages,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as well as contact with languages of the</v>

148
00:08:30.641 --> 00:08:31.474
<v Speaker 1>other ethnic communities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>singer and seems to have some creole </v>

149
00:08:34.421 --> 00:08:37.060
<v Speaker 1>elements as well as an element of code </v>
<v Speaker 1>switching,</v>

150
00:08:37.090 --> 00:08:41.590
<v Speaker 1>especially with English.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The grammar is essentially mandarin with</v>

151
00:08:41.591 --> 00:08:44.500
<v Speaker 1>a lot of vocabulary borrowed from other </v>
<v Speaker 1>Chinese languages,</v>

152
00:08:44.550 --> 00:08:49.150
<v Speaker 1>ballet as well as English and sometimes </v>
<v Speaker 1>entire phrases or clauses or in English.</v>

153
00:08:49.710 --> 00:08:52.840
<v Speaker 1>Here are a couple of sentences in sing </v>
<v Speaker 1>Durham Conan.</v>

154
00:08:52.841 --> 00:08:56.530
<v Speaker 1>Next week,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how's the whole woman tie an English?</v>

155
00:08:56.620 --> 00:08:59.650
<v Speaker 1>Maybe we can meet next week after I </v>
<v Speaker 1>finished my exams.</v>

156
00:09:00.100 --> 00:09:00.933
<v Speaker 1>In this first sentence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we see basically a mandarin sentence </v>

157
00:09:03.251 --> 00:09:06.580
<v Speaker 1>with some English vocabulary taking the </v>
<v Speaker 1>place of Mandarin words</v>

158
00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:09.993
<v Speaker 3>wait</v>

159
00:09:11.070 --> 00:09:13.200
<v Speaker 1>and English.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The weather today is too hot.</v>

160
00:09:13.230 --> 00:09:16.560
<v Speaker 1>I can't stand it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In the second sentence we see an English</v>

161
00:09:16.561 --> 00:09:20.040
<v Speaker 1>word and then this word boy is a Hokkien</v>
<v Speaker 1>word,</v>

162
00:09:20.070 --> 00:09:20.903
<v Speaker 1>meaning cannot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this word [inaudible] Hahn is a </v>

163
00:09:22.891 --> 00:09:24.420
<v Speaker 1>Malay word,</v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning tolerate.</v>

164
00:09:24.810 --> 00:09:27.300
<v Speaker 1>These two words often appear together in</v>
<v Speaker 1>this phrase,</v>

165
00:09:27.330 --> 00:09:29.400
<v Speaker 1>meaning something like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't stand it.</v>

166
00:09:30.310 --> 00:09:31.143
<v Speaker 1>Other forms of Chinese spoken in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Singapore apart from Mandarin and </v>

167
00:09:33.641 --> 00:09:38.170
<v Speaker 1>Hokkien include guilt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You Cantonese Haka and high knees,</v>

168
00:09:38.380 --> 00:09:39.213
<v Speaker 1>but the government's promotion of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Mandarin is causing it to gradually </v>

169
00:09:41.801 --> 00:09:46.420
<v Speaker 1>replace the others Malai.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The third most widely spoken of the four</v>

170
00:09:46.421 --> 00:09:49.600
<v Speaker 1>official languages is molay or Bahasa </v>
<v Speaker 1>Melayu,</v>

171
00:09:49.660 --> 00:09:54.400
<v Speaker 1>which is spoken by around 10.7%</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the officially resident population.</v>

172
00:09:54.610 --> 00:09:55.443
<v Speaker 1>Malaya has also given special status as </v>
<v Speaker 1>the national language of Singapore as a </v>

173
00:09:59.351 --> 00:10:00.184
<v Speaker 1>result of this special status.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's used in the national anthem in </v>

174
00:10:02.891 --> 00:10:05.950
<v Speaker 1>military drills and on the Singaporean </v>
<v Speaker 1>coat of arms.</v>

175
00:10:06.670 --> 00:10:10.870
<v Speaker 1>Malaysia and Singapore in its standard </v>
<v Speaker 1>form is essentially the same as standard</v>

176
00:10:10.871 --> 00:10:14.740
<v Speaker 1>molay as used in Malaysia and in Brunei.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In addition to standard Molay,</v>

177
00:10:14.770 --> 00:10:19.030
<v Speaker 1>there's also a molay creole called Baba </v>
<v Speaker 1>Malai or Peranakan Malai,</v>

178
00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:20.073
<v Speaker 1>which is endangered,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's still spoken fluently by some </v>

179
00:10:22.001 --> 00:10:22.834
<v Speaker 1>older people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The peranakan are the descendants of </v>

180
00:10:24.881 --> 00:10:25.714
<v Speaker 1>settlers who married local malaise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This contact of cultures resulted in a </v>

181
00:10:29.381 --> 00:10:31.930
<v Speaker 1>creole language with mostly malave </v>
<v Speaker 1>vocabulary,</v>

182
00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:32.793
<v Speaker 1>but with influence of Chinese grammar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's another similar form of molay </v>

183
00:10:36.971 --> 00:10:40.910
<v Speaker 1>called Bazaar Malaysia or Malaya Pasada,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a pigeon form of my leg,</v>

184
00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:44.860
<v Speaker 1>which has no native speakers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Decades ago when English was less widely</v>

185
00:10:44.861 --> 00:10:45.694
<v Speaker 1>spoken.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bazaar molay often functioned as a </v>

186
00:10:47.291 --> 00:10:48.124
<v Speaker 1>Lingua Franca.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's now spoken mainly by some older </v>

187
00:10:50.441 --> 00:10:54.490
<v Speaker 1>Singaporeans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's an example of bazaar millay.</v>

188
00:10:54.790 --> 00:10:57.460
<v Speaker 1>I'll give you a sentence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Meaning when a Singaporean,</v>

189
00:10:57.461 --> 00:10:58.294
<v Speaker 1>here's where goods are cheap,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he goes there first in Standard Malaya </v>

190
00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:03.910
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] Monday,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nada,</v>

191
00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:04.980
<v Speaker 1>10 Dung,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tim Pat,</v>

192
00:11:04.990 --> 00:11:05.823
<v Speaker 1>young men pony I baton Woulda,</v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] huggy Kissy to a more or </v>

193
00:11:09.281 --> 00:11:13.750
<v Speaker 1>less direct translation into English </v>
<v Speaker 1>would be when person of Singapore.</v>

194
00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:18.840
<v Speaker 1>Here's about place that has cheap goods.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He will go to there next in bazaar,</v>

195
00:11:20.391 --> 00:11:23.820
<v Speaker 1>Millay Singapore up when you're done </v>
<v Speaker 1>telling a dia de God man,</v>

196
00:11:23.821 --> 00:11:24.860
<v Speaker 1>a young bud,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Buddha,</v>

197
00:11:24.920 --> 00:11:26.300
<v Speaker 1>the buggy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

198
00:11:26.301 --> 00:11:30.320
<v Speaker 1>more or less direct translation of this </v>
<v Speaker 1>would be Singapore's person.</v>

199
00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:33.500
<v Speaker 1>His ear here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where that goods cheap,</v>

200
00:11:33.770 --> 00:11:34.603
<v Speaker 1>he goes in the bazaar millay sentence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the word for when is absent and then we </v>

201
00:11:39.521 --> 00:11:43.330
<v Speaker 1>see a different way of expressing </v>
<v Speaker 1>Singaporean in standard molay.</v>

202
00:11:43.510 --> 00:11:44.343
<v Speaker 1>The word [inaudible],</v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning person comes first and the </v>

203
00:11:46.391 --> 00:11:49.960
<v Speaker 1>modifying word single Pooda comes after </v>
<v Speaker 1>in bazaar millay.</v>

204
00:11:49.990 --> 00:11:50.823
<v Speaker 1>The modifier Singapore comes before and </v>
<v Speaker 1>followed by the modifying particle </v>

205
00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:55.833
<v Speaker 1>Poonja.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This word exists in Standard Malaya and </v>

206
00:11:57.731 --> 00:11:58.564
<v Speaker 1>means have an actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can see it as the root of this word </v>

207
00:12:01.241 --> 00:12:02.074
<v Speaker 1>right here and then Brunei.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But in bazaar molay it mimics this </v>

208
00:12:04.691 --> 00:12:05.524
<v Speaker 1>Chinese modifying particle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let me point out one more difference in </v>

209
00:12:09.091 --> 00:12:10.410
<v Speaker 1>the standard molay sentence.</v>

210
00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:11.273
<v Speaker 1>You see the word for here when the God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in Bazaar Molay you see Donato in </v>

211
00:12:15.981 --> 00:12:18.650
<v Speaker 1>bazaar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Millay affixes are often dropped and the</v>

212
00:12:18.651 --> 00:12:21.980
<v Speaker 1>word root is used instead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tamil,</v>

213
00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:25.820
<v Speaker 1>the least widely spoken of the four </v>
<v Speaker 1>official languages is Tamil,</v>

214
00:12:25.940 --> 00:12:26.773
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dravidian language that is spoken </v>

215
00:12:27.801 --> 00:12:28.634
<v Speaker 1>primarily in southern India and in some </v>
<v Speaker 1>parts of Sri Lanka and has also spoken </v>

216
00:12:32.421 --> 00:12:33.254
<v Speaker 1>by a significant minority in Malaysia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has approximately 70 million native </v>

217
00:12:37.371 --> 00:12:39.980
<v Speaker 1>speakers worldwide.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In Singapore,</v>

218
00:12:39.981 --> 00:12:40.814
<v Speaker 1>9.1%</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the population is of Indian </v>

219
00:12:43.011 --> 00:12:45.170
<v Speaker 1>background,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but only 3.3%</v>

220
00:12:45.171 --> 00:12:47.450
<v Speaker 1>speak Tamil as their main language at </v>
<v Speaker 1>home.</v>

221
00:12:47.510 --> 00:12:48.343
<v Speaker 1>Many ethnic Indians speak English as </v>
<v Speaker 1>their home language or another Indian </v>

222
00:12:51.471 --> 00:12:52.304
<v Speaker 1>language or my lay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At the time when Tamil was chosen as an </v>

223
00:12:55.671 --> 00:12:56.504
<v Speaker 1>official language,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was spoken by the majority of the </v>

224
00:12:58.371 --> 00:12:59.204
<v Speaker 1>Indian population of Singapore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the language has declined and has </v>

225
00:13:02.301 --> 00:13:03.134
<v Speaker 1>now learned as a second language by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>majority of the Indian population since </v>

226
00:13:07.041 --> 00:13:08.930
<v Speaker 1>it's still their assigned mother tongue.</v>

227
00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:11.073
<v Speaker 1>This information we've discussed so far </v>
<v Speaker 1>includes the so called resident </v>

228
00:13:14.241 --> 00:13:15.074
<v Speaker 1>population which is comprised of both </v>
<v Speaker 1>citizens and permanent residents of </v>

229
00:13:18.411 --> 00:13:19.244
<v Speaker 1>Singapore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The total resident population is about </v>

230
00:13:21.351 --> 00:13:22.184
<v Speaker 1>3.9</v>
<v Speaker 1>million but there's also a large non </v>

231
00:13:24.381 --> 00:13:27.560
<v Speaker 1>resident population of about 1.7</v>
<v Speaker 1>million people.</v>

232
00:13:27.680 --> 00:13:28.513
<v Speaker 1>The term non resident is misleading and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you should think of them as non </v>

233
00:13:31.371 --> 00:13:32.204
<v Speaker 1>permanent residents or as expatriates </v>
<v Speaker 1>because we're not talking about </v>

234
00:13:35.301 --> 00:13:36.134
<v Speaker 1>tourists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These are people who do reside in </v>

00:13:37.461 --> 00:13:40.520
<v Speaker 1>Singapore having one of the freest </v>
<v Speaker 1>economies in the world.</v>

236
00:13:40.550 --> 00:13:44.420
<v Speaker 1>Singapore has attracted a large number </v>
<v Speaker 1>of foreign companies and foreign workers</v>

237
00:13:44.421 --> 00:13:45.254
<v Speaker 1>to its shores making Singapore a </v>
<v Speaker 1>cosmopolitan business and finance hub </v>

238
00:13:48.980 --> 00:13:51.830
<v Speaker 1>where you can hear languages from all </v>
<v Speaker 1>over the world being spoken.</v>

239
00:13:52.010 --> 00:13:52.843
<v Speaker 1>The main Lingua Franca used amongst </v>
<v Speaker 1>these diverse groups of people is </v>

240
00:13:55.491 --> 00:13:56.324
<v Speaker 1>English with Mandarin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Also serving as a Lingua Franca for the </v>

241
00:13:58.701 --> 00:13:59.534
<v Speaker 1>Chinese community,</v>
<v Speaker 1>both residents and non resident with </v>

242
00:14:01.851 --> 00:14:02.684
<v Speaker 1>Singapore granting permanent residence </v>
<v Speaker 1>and citizenship to new immigrants every </v>

00:14:06.110 --> 00:14:06.260
<v Speaker 1>year.</v>

244
00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:07.093
<v Speaker 1>The linguistic situation there will </v>
<v Speaker 1>certainly continue to be rich and </v>

245
00:14:09.921 --> 00:14:10.754
<v Speaker 1>colorful and vibrant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The question of the day for </v>

246
00:14:13.281 --> 00:14:14.114
<v Speaker 1>Singaporeans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what languages do you regularly speak </v>

247

249

<v Speaker 1>there?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you speak English,</v>

250
00:14:24.950 --> 00:14:28.490
<v Speaker 1>what has been your experience with </v>
<v Speaker 1>Singaporean English and singlish?</v>
