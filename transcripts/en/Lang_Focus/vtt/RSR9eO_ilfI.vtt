00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:03.660
<v Speaker 1>Hello everyone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>welcome to the focus channel and my name</v>

2
00:00:03.661 --> 00:00:04.471
<v Speaker 1>is Paul.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Today.</v>

3
00:00:04.471 --> 00:00:07.290
<v Speaker 1>Rather than get into a new indepth </v>
<v Speaker 1>language documentary,</v>

4
00:00:07.291 --> 00:00:10.440
<v Speaker 1>I decided to do a fun little video that </v>
<v Speaker 1>we can do together.</v>

5
00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:11.513
<v Speaker 1>I want to give you a challenge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to present you with some mystery </v>

6
00:00:14.131 --> 00:00:18.390
<v Speaker 1>languages and you can listen and look at</v>
<v Speaker 1>those languages and guess what languages</v>

7
00:00:18.391 --> 00:00:22.350
<v Speaker 1>they are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but don't worry,</v>

8
00:00:22.351 --> 00:00:24.390
<v Speaker 1>even if you don't guess the language </v>
<v Speaker 1>correctly,</v>

9
00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:25.313
<v Speaker 1>it'll still be interesting as long as </v>
<v Speaker 1>you share the reasons for your guesses </v>

10
00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.240
<v Speaker 1>in the comments down below.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's give it a try.</v>

11
00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.010
<v Speaker 1>Here's the first language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Please listen</v>

12
00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:39.550
<v Speaker 2>almost as good as get back because they </v>
<v Speaker 2>know me when I just to put in the sweat,</v>

13
00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:49.590
<v Speaker 2>did look in the dark with some of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>what is it,</v>

14
00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:56.090
<v Speaker 2>what we see as they go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really?</v>

15
00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:59.290
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and let me also show you a little bit of</v>

16
00:00:59.291 --> 00:01:02.020
<v Speaker 1>that language in its written form.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't speak this language,</v>

17
00:01:02.021 --> 00:01:06.880
<v Speaker 1>but I'll try to read it as best I can </v>
<v Speaker 1>gamble and he went back up.</v>

18
00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:10.120
<v Speaker 1>So what language is it?</v>

19
00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:21.140
<v Speaker 1>The language is Haitian creole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're a French speaker,</v>

20
00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:22.033
<v Speaker 1>then right away you might have known </v>
<v Speaker 1>that this was Haitian creole and other </v>

21
00:01:24.291 --> 00:01:25.124
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might have noticed some words that </v>

22
00:01:26.181 --> 00:01:28.460
<v Speaker 1>sounded French,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but sounded a little different.</v>

23
00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:29.533
<v Speaker 1>That's because the Haitian creole </v>
<v Speaker 1>language is a French based creole </v>

24
00:01:32.241 --> 00:01:33.074
<v Speaker 1>language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It arose in the 17th and 18th centuries </v>

25
00:01:35.211 --> 00:01:36.044
<v Speaker 1>because of interaction between French </v>
<v Speaker 1>settlers and African slaves in the area </v>

26
00:01:39.201 --> 00:01:40.034
<v Speaker 1>that is now called Haiti.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The majority of its vocabulary derives </v>

27
00:01:43.431 --> 00:01:44.264
<v Speaker 1>from French,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the majority of its syntax to rise </v>

28
00:01:46.281 --> 00:01:48.560
<v Speaker 1>from the African languages spoken by the</v>
<v Speaker 1>slips.</v>

29
00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:51.620
<v Speaker 1>Let's go back to those two examples </v>
<v Speaker 1>sentences for a second game.</v>

30
00:01:51.621 --> 00:01:52.454
<v Speaker 1>Mooney valley.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This means is there a person here who </v>

31
00:01:55.041 --> 00:01:55.874
<v Speaker 1>speaks English?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The beginning of the sentence doesn't </v>

32
00:01:57.561 --> 00:02:00.980
<v Speaker 1>really seem French means to have or </v>
<v Speaker 1>there is.</v>

33
00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:03.500
<v Speaker 1>It might derive from the French word gun</v>
<v Speaker 1>yet,</v>

34
00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:04.573
<v Speaker 1>but the way it's used as quite different</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the French word and moon means </v>

35
00:02:07.011 --> 00:02:12.011
<v Speaker 1>person and I don't know the origin of </v>
<v Speaker 1>this word is it is like in French,</v>

36
00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.810
<v Speaker 1>in French.</v>

37
00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:16.650
<v Speaker 1>The whole sentence I guess would be </v>
<v Speaker 1>India,</v>

38
00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:17.600
<v Speaker 1>calc one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Siki,</v>

39
00:02:17.601 --> 00:02:21.580
<v Speaker 1>Pat Langley.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The second sentence went back up.</v>

40
00:02:21.581 --> 00:02:22.414
<v Speaker 1>Ballet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm.</v>

41
00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:26.420
<v Speaker 1>This means I can't speak English when it</v>
<v Speaker 1>comes from one in French.</v>

42
00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:27.643
<v Speaker 1>Pop is the French negation marker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pop Cup comes from the French couple </v>

43
00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:35.870
<v Speaker 1>color pallet's partly so the vocabulary </v>
<v Speaker 1>has all kinds of French,</v>

44
00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:36.733
<v Speaker 1>but in French it would be like this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You shouldn't sweep back a public park </v>

45
00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:39.793
<v Speaker 1>Langley,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so obviously the grammar is very </v>

46
00:02:41.211 --> 00:02:43.730
<v Speaker 1>different even though the vocabulary is </v>
<v Speaker 1>French based.</v>

47
00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:47.630
<v Speaker 1>Notice that in the French sentence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why is not used but is used.</v>

48
00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:50.240
<v Speaker 1>That's because in French was the object </v>
<v Speaker 1>Pronoun.</v>

49
00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:54.320
<v Speaker 1>Wells is the subject.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pronouns in Haitian creole went is both.</v>

50
00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:55.273
<v Speaker 1>Now I'm breaking down these sentences </v>
<v Speaker 1>just to show you that Haitian creole is </v>

51
00:02:57.501 --> 00:02:59.980
<v Speaker 1>a combination of French and other </v>
<v Speaker 1>influences.</v>

52
00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:00.903
<v Speaker 1>To learn more about creole languages,</v>
<v Speaker 1>check out my video on pigeons and </v>

53
00:03:03.161 --> 00:03:05.350
<v Speaker 1>creoles right here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

54
00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:07.300
<v Speaker 1>onto the next language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Please listen.</v>

55
00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:13.240
<v Speaker 3>Like William helped because it gave me a</v>
<v Speaker 3>this quarter.</v>

56
00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:20.230
<v Speaker 3>What am I going to be challenged by?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Volley ball,</v>

57
00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:22.463
<v Speaker 3>volleyball,</v>
<v Speaker 3>petroleum and Yoko needs or glade </v>

58
00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:25.243
<v Speaker 3>helper.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You only have moved the number from the </v>

59
00:03:27.291 --> 00:03:29.870
<v Speaker 3>leaders from and that's why the egg </v>
<v Speaker 3>before for sure.</v>

60
00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:30.713
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>

61
00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:32.343
<v Speaker 1>and again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me show you a little bit of that </v>

62
00:03:33.221 --> 00:03:34.450
<v Speaker 1>language in its written form,</v>

63
00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:35.683
<v Speaker 4>Bene in Esl scene and more shoots in </v>
<v Speaker 4>streatham clear at all and now he dot </v>

64
00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:52.310
<v Speaker 4>from on his phone on him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nor were they.</v>

65
00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:54.293
<v Speaker 1>So what language is it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The language is Phrygian specifically </v>

66
00:04:00.051 --> 00:04:00.884
<v Speaker 1>West Virginia West Division has spoken </v>
<v Speaker 1>in a northern province of the </v>

67
00:04:03.441 --> 00:04:04.274
<v Speaker 1>Netherlands called friesland.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Freshmen is thought to be the language </v>

68
00:04:07.431 --> 00:04:08.264
<v Speaker 1>that is most closely related to English.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now it doesn't mean that it's easy for </v>

69
00:04:11.301 --> 00:04:14.660
<v Speaker 1>English speakers to understand friction </v>
<v Speaker 1>when I hear it or when I try to read it,</v>

70
00:04:14.661 --> 00:04:15.494
<v Speaker 1>I barely understand anything but it is </v>
<v Speaker 1>closely related to English and its </v>

71
00:04:18.021 --> 00:04:20.930
<v Speaker 1>historical development and in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>structure of the language.</v>

72
00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:22.880
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's do one last language.</v>

73
00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:23.893
<v Speaker 1>Please listen.</v>

74
00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:28.970
<v Speaker 5>Like is it just pulls out that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So it goes under the Jamaican guy.</v>

75
00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:40.750
<v Speaker 5>So I've been buying for Bella so I'd be </v>
<v Speaker 5>there about budget dry.</v>

76
00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:43.533
<v Speaker 1>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's look at a couple of phrases </v>

77
00:04:44.501 --> 00:04:46.450
<v Speaker 1>visually.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I don't speak this language,</v>

78
00:04:46.451 --> 00:04:48.280
<v Speaker 1>but I'll try to read these as best I </v>
<v Speaker 1>can.</v>

79
00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:52.030
<v Speaker 1>Knowing comprendo nonfatal suicide to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>meet this bloody boo.</v>

80
00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:53.950
<v Speaker 1>So what language is it?</v>

81
00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:58.343
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you know a romance language than you </v>

82
00:04:59.551 --> 00:05:03.300
<v Speaker 1>probably noticed right away that this is</v>
<v Speaker 1>definitely another romance language.</v>

83
00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:04.253
<v Speaker 1>It is actually the Sardinian language,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is spoken on the island of </v>

84
00:05:06.541 --> 00:05:07.374
<v Speaker 1>Sardinia in Italy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is one of many regional languages in </v>

85
00:05:09.811 --> 00:05:12.600
<v Speaker 1>Italy that are often mistakenly referred</v>
<v Speaker 1>to as dialects,</v>

86
00:05:12.601 --> 00:05:13.434
<v Speaker 1>but they're actually separate languages.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most of them are closely related to </v>

87
00:05:16.111 --> 00:05:16.944
<v Speaker 1>Italian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they are different enough to be </v>

88
00:05:18.001 --> 00:05:19.530
<v Speaker 1>considered different languages.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

89
00:05:19.531 --> 00:05:23.100
<v Speaker 1>I hope you enjoyed guessing today's </v>
<v Speaker 1>mystery languages even if you didn't get</v>

90
00:05:23.101 --> 00:05:24.000
<v Speaker 1>them right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's okay.</v>

91
00:05:24.001 --> 00:05:24.834
<v Speaker 1>It should be interesting to share your </v>
<v Speaker 1>reasons in the comments down below and </v>

92
00:05:27.001 --> 00:05:27.834
<v Speaker 1>that should spark some interesting </v>
<v Speaker 1>discussion and if you would like to see </v>
