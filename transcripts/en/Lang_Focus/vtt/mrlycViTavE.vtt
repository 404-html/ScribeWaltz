00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:16.823
<v Speaker 1>Hello everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Welcome to the Lange Focus Channel and </v>

5
00:00:18.481 --> 00:00:19.314
<v Speaker 1>my name is Paul.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Today's topic is how similar our French </v>

6
00:00:21.991 --> 00:00:24.360
<v Speaker 1>and Italian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well they're actually very similar.</v>

7
00:00:24.361 --> 00:00:25.194
<v Speaker 1>They share a lot of common vocabulary </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the grammar is very similar but in </v>

8
00:00:28.321 --> 00:00:30.420
<v Speaker 1>terms of phonology they are quite </v>
<v Speaker 1>different.</v>

9
00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.960
<v Speaker 1>So in their spoken form they are </v>
<v Speaker 1>generally not mutually intelligible.</v>

10
00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.540
<v Speaker 1>French and Italian are both romance </v>
<v Speaker 1>languages.</v>

11
00:00:36.541 --> 00:00:37.374
<v Speaker 1>They both developed out of the vulgar </v>
<v Speaker 1>Latin spoken throughout the Roman </v>

12
00:00:39.871 --> 00:00:40.704
<v Speaker 1>empire,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but French kind of stands out as </v>

13
00:00:42.121 --> 00:00:42.954
<v Speaker 1>different from other romance languages.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The historical land of goal is located </v>

14
00:00:46.381 --> 00:00:47.214
<v Speaker 1>inside Modern Day France and one theory </v>
<v Speaker 1>is that when the Roman empire conquered </v>

15
00:00:50.341 --> 00:00:53.760
<v Speaker 1>Gaul and tried to force the local </v>
<v Speaker 1>population to speak Latin,</v>

16
00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:54.773
<v Speaker 1>they spoke at using golish speech sounds</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that has affected the phonology and </v>

17
00:00:58.021 --> 00:00:58.854
<v Speaker 1>the pronunciation of French.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Until this day goldfish was a Celtic </v>

18
00:01:01.351 --> 00:01:02.184
<v Speaker 1>language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that means that there is some Celtic </v>

19
00:01:03.331 --> 00:01:07.200
<v Speaker 1>influence in the French language,</v>
<v Speaker 1>specifically in phonology and any case,</v>

20
00:01:07.201 --> 00:01:09.600
<v Speaker 1>French and Italian are very closely </v>
<v Speaker 1>related.</v>

21
00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.730
<v Speaker 1>Let's have a look at just how close they</v>
<v Speaker 1>are.</v>

22
00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:12.863
<v Speaker 1>Vocabulary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Italian and French are very similar in </v>

23
00:01:15.031 --> 00:01:15.864
<v Speaker 1>terms of vocabulary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The lexical similarity of the two </v>

24
00:01:18.001 --> 00:01:18.834
<v Speaker 1>languages is 89% that means that 89% of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the words used have equivalents or </v>

25
00:01:23.041 --> 00:01:23.874
<v Speaker 1>cognates in the other language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't mean the words are exactly </v>

26
00:01:26.311 --> 00:01:28.050
<v Speaker 1>the same,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they are clearly related.</v>

27
00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.230
<v Speaker 1>Some obvious examples,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Valenzuela,</v>

28
00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.910
<v Speaker 1>bon Jordan'll until the song into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Sunday mosaic,</v>

29
00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:36.223
<v Speaker 1>monae,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jada,</v>

30
00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:41.660
<v Speaker 1>and there are some less obvious cognates</v>
<v Speaker 1>to or be dull or medallia order Akella,</v>

31
00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.400
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] Yada Shelf Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She had a car.</v>

32
00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:48.253
<v Speaker 1>Then I think the figure of 89% is </v>
<v Speaker 1>probably true if we include formal </v>

33
00:01:52.741 --> 00:01:53.574
<v Speaker 1>literary vocabulary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in daily conversation that seems to </v>

34
00:01:55.591 --> 00:01:57.750
<v Speaker 1>be a little lower.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's look at these examples.</v>

35
00:01:58.030 --> 00:01:59.750
<v Speaker 1>Maquila to have Aaliyah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>avn,</v>

36
00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:01.440
<v Speaker 1>ecomaine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cucina t prep,</v>

37
00:02:01.441 --> 00:02:03.080
<v Speaker 1>our own cafe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Msi,</v>

38
00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.960
<v Speaker 1>Sita Valisa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>viansa vic McDonald cuisine is you're to</v>

39
00:02:05.961 --> 00:02:06.810
<v Speaker 1>play pound coffee.</v>

40
00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:07.913
<v Speaker 1>So here you can see that most of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>words have an equivalent except for the </v>

41
00:02:10.561 --> 00:02:12.780
<v Speaker 1>words that are in red.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those ones are different,</v>

42
00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.883
<v Speaker 1>like the word for here in Italian it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>queen and in French it's see and that </v>

43
00:02:17.191 --> 00:02:18.024
<v Speaker 1>were four width.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In Italian it's con and in friendships </v>

44
00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:24.420
<v Speaker 1>Avec the word for Ian in Italian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's in and in friendships don't,</v>

45
00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:25.793
<v Speaker 1>aside from those words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the other words are all basically </v>

46
00:02:27.451 --> 00:02:28.284
<v Speaker 1>equivalent except for a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 1>definite articles which are used </v>

47
00:02:30.631 --> 00:02:33.060
<v Speaker 1>differently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I recommend that you pause the video now</v>

48
00:02:33.061 --> 00:02:33.894
<v Speaker 1>and look at the two sentences along with</v>
<v Speaker 1>an English breakdown and see what you </v>

49
00:02:36.751 --> 00:02:37.584
<v Speaker 1>notice about the equivalents.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here are another couple of examples in </v>

50
00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:46.200
<v Speaker 1>nondomestic rtd and Entrada in an </v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] in nuclear power,</v>

51
00:02:46.201 --> 00:02:48.140
<v Speaker 1>don't weight loss a magazine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ceramic,</v>

52
00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:50.580
<v Speaker 1>so again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these sentences are quite similar,</v>

53
00:02:50.581 --> 00:02:52.800
<v Speaker 1>but a few of the words are different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The mentee,</v>

54
00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:53.703
<v Speaker 1>Kathy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that means forget in Italian and who </v>

55
00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:57.150
<v Speaker 1>bleah means,</v>
<v Speaker 1>forget in French.</v>

56
00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:58.133
<v Speaker 1>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we see the different words for in the </v>

57
00:02:59.501 --> 00:03:01.930
<v Speaker 1>Italian word in and the French word </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't.</v>

58
00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:05.080
<v Speaker 1>And we see different words for store,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Italian word,</v>

59
00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:07.540
<v Speaker 1>niggled steel and the French word </v>
<v Speaker 1>magazine.</v>

60
00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:10.540
<v Speaker 1>So again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why don't you pause the video and have a</v>

61
00:03:10.541 --> 00:03:13.630
<v Speaker 1>look at the two sentences and see what </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can learn by comparing them.</v>

62
00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:17.880
<v Speaker 1>So you can see that in a typical </v>
<v Speaker 1>sentence.</v>

63
00:03:17.881 --> 00:03:18.714
<v Speaker 1>The majority of vocabulary used is </v>
<v Speaker 1>similar to the vocabulary used in the </v>

64
00:03:21.631 --> 00:03:23.340
<v Speaker 1>other language,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not all of it.</v>

65
00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:24.653
<v Speaker 1>Grammar in French and Italian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the word order and the sentence </v>

66
00:03:26.821 --> 00:03:30.120
<v Speaker 1>structure are generally very similar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's a simple sentence to show.</v>

67
00:03:30.121 --> 00:03:30.954
<v Speaker 1>Similar would order.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This sentence means I have a newspaper </v>

68
00:03:33.091 --> 00:03:36.830
<v Speaker 1>for the trip.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He Oh and John anally pedal viaggio j on</v>

69
00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:40.260
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you can see that these sentences are</v>

70
00:03:40.261 --> 00:03:41.820
<v Speaker 1>word for word translatable.</v>

71
00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:43.773
<v Speaker 2>Hmm.</v>

72
00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:46.310
<v Speaker 1>But there are also some grammatical </v>
<v Speaker 1>differences too.</v>

73
00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:49.670
<v Speaker 1>In French subject,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pronouns are consistently used,</v>

74
00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:50.743
<v Speaker 1>but in Italian subject,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pronouns generally aren't used except </v>

75
00:03:53.031 --> 00:03:55.550
<v Speaker 1>for emphasis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in French you ship out lonely.</v>

76
00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:56.713
<v Speaker 1>In Italian you will following lazy but </v>
<v Speaker 1>yo is not usually said so which just </v>

77
00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:05.480
<v Speaker 1>paddling glazer and there's another </v>
<v Speaker 1>difference in pronouns in French.</v>

78
00:04:05.481 --> 00:04:09.500
<v Speaker 1>The second person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>formal end plural pronoun is in Italian.</v>

79
00:04:09.501 --> 00:04:13.340
<v Speaker 1>The third person Pronoun Lei is used for</v>
<v Speaker 1>the second person formal.</v>

80
00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:16.700
<v Speaker 1>So when French we'd have [inaudible] </v>
<v Speaker 1>toll on tomorrow,</v>

81
00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:18.253
<v Speaker 1>but in Italian [inaudible] so the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Italian sentence is like she speaks too </v>

82
00:04:22.941 --> 00:04:23.774
<v Speaker 1>slowly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it should be clear from the context </v>

83
00:04:25.161 --> 00:04:25.994
<v Speaker 1>that you are seeing you and not she </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you're talking to someone </v>

84
00:04:28.221 --> 00:04:29.054
<v Speaker 1>directly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Also in Italian direct object pronouns </v>

85
00:04:31.851 --> 00:04:34.340
<v Speaker 1>are also normally attached to the end of</v>
<v Speaker 1>a verb.</v>

86
00:04:34.341 --> 00:04:38.060
<v Speaker 1>When it's in the infinitive form.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In French we'd have shoveled day,</v>

87
00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:39.463
<v Speaker 1>but in Italian we'd have eal volume.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rollo negotiation is also a little </v>

88
00:04:44.511 --> 00:04:45.800
<v Speaker 1>different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In the two languages.</v>

89
00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:47.880
<v Speaker 1>In French we'd say Jeanette backlit </v>
<v Speaker 1>phone,</v>

90
00:04:47.881 --> 00:04:48.714
<v Speaker 1>glee with no end path to show negation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But in Italian we'd say eo known </v>

91
00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:53.360
<v Speaker 1>paddling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lazy.</v>

92
00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:54.253
<v Speaker 1>So in French we have no and pop,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in Italian there's no equivalent of </v>

93
00:04:57.261 --> 00:04:58.094
<v Speaker 1>Po.</v>

94
00:04:58.810 --> 00:04:59.643
<v Speaker 1>Those are some little differences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But other major things like the verb </v>

95
00:05:01.811 --> 00:05:04.150
<v Speaker 1>tenses are basically the same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>French and Italian.</v>

96
00:05:04.151 --> 00:05:06.610
<v Speaker 1>Share the same 14 verb tenses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

97
00:05:06.611 --> 00:05:07.444
<v Speaker 1>they're not conjugated exactly the same,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the tense is function in the same </v>

98
00:05:10.121 --> 00:05:11.080
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

99
00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:14.720
<v Speaker 1>let's look at how the past tense is </v>
<v Speaker 1>formed in French to a mosaic.</v>

100
00:05:14.721 --> 00:05:18.130
<v Speaker 1>Elka shows in Italian too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm on Jato quelled Coza.</v>

101
00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:21.880
<v Speaker 1>This means you ate something spoken to </v>
<v Speaker 1>one person informally.</v>

102
00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:23.650
<v Speaker 1>The verb consists of two parts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First,</v>

103
00:05:23.651 --> 00:05:24.484
<v Speaker 1>the second person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>singular form of the word for have and </v>

104
00:05:26.621 --> 00:05:30.160
<v Speaker 1>second the past participle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obviously the forms are different,</v>

105
00:05:30.161 --> 00:05:33.310
<v Speaker 1>but the way you use them together to </v>
<v Speaker 1>create the past tense is the sin.</v>

106
00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:34.593
<v Speaker 1>And just as a quick side note,</v>
<v Speaker 1>notice how to say something in the two </v>

107
00:05:36.671 --> 00:05:39.550
<v Speaker 1>languages.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kelika shows versus qual.</v>

108
00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:40.443
<v Speaker 1>Coza,</v>
<v Speaker 1>French and Italian grammar is very </v>

109
00:05:41.981 --> 00:05:42.814
<v Speaker 1>similar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just like the vocabulary is largely </v>

110
00:05:44.291 --> 00:05:45.520
<v Speaker 1>similar pronunciation.</v>

111
00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:46.503
<v Speaker 1>The biggest difference between French </v>
<v Speaker 1>and Italian and the one that prevents </v>

112
00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:51.700
<v Speaker 1>mutual intelligibility the most is </v>
<v Speaker 1>pronunciation.</v>

113
00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:55.210
<v Speaker 1>Italian pronunciation is mostly phonetic</v>
<v Speaker 1>and mirrors the written words.</v>

114
00:05:55.211 --> 00:05:57.890
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>French words are pronounced from the way</v>

115
00:05:57.891 --> 00:06:00.200
<v Speaker 1>they're written,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you have to keep some phonetic rules</v>

116
00:06:00.201 --> 00:06:04.040
<v Speaker 1>in mind when pronouncing words.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most Italian words end in a vowel,</v>

117
00:06:04.041 --> 00:06:06.200
<v Speaker 1>which makes it easy to pronounce the end</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the word.</v>

118
00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:07.243
<v Speaker 1>In French,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are many consonants that are </v>

119
00:06:08.451 --> 00:06:10.820
<v Speaker 1>usually silent at the end of a word.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

120
00:06:10.821 --> 00:06:15.530
<v Speaker 1>this sentence meaning the weather is </v>
<v Speaker 1>cold in Italian [inaudible] in French in</v>

121
00:06:15.531 --> 00:06:16.364
<v Speaker 1>fifth squat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Notice that the d sound at the end of </v>

122
00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:19.363
<v Speaker 1>fall is silent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Another example is the phrase for white </v>

123
00:06:22.131 --> 00:06:22.964
<v Speaker 1>wine in Italian Vino Bianco in French.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then blown here at the final C is </v>

124
00:06:27.531 --> 00:06:28.364
<v Speaker 1>silent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the last song we hear is the nasal </v>

125
00:06:29.931 --> 00:06:33.410
<v Speaker 1>sound represented by in van also ends in</v>
<v Speaker 1>a nasal sound.</v>

126
00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:35.630
<v Speaker 1>The end is not pronounced as a consonant</v>
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>

127
00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:38.030
<v Speaker 1>Instead that nasal aises the proceeding </v>
<v Speaker 1>vowel,</v>

128
00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:40.700
<v Speaker 1>so rather than Van Blonde,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's van blown.</v>

129
00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:44.390
<v Speaker 1>There are also some other sounds that </v>
<v Speaker 1>are quite different than French.</v>

130
00:06:44.391 --> 00:06:45.620
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the French are,</v>

131
00:06:45.621 --> 00:06:48.560
<v Speaker 1>it's not the same as the rolled or that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you would find in Italian.</v>

132
00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:49.573
<v Speaker 1>In Italian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you produce the are by flapping the tip </v>

133
00:06:51.381 --> 00:06:53.300
<v Speaker 1>of your tongue against the roof of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>mouth,</v>

134
00:06:53.301 --> 00:06:54.134
<v Speaker 1>behind your teeth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the French are as a guttural are </v>

135
00:06:55.881 --> 00:06:57.560
<v Speaker 1>that's produced at the back of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>mouth.</v>

136
00:06:58.790 --> 00:07:01.690
<v Speaker 1>In Italian [inaudible] in French </v>
<v Speaker 1>bacteria.</v>

137
00:07:02.810 --> 00:07:03.643
<v Speaker 1>So those final silent consonants as well</v>
<v Speaker 1>as the nasal sounds of the French are </v>

138
00:07:06.891 --> 00:07:08.960
<v Speaker 1>south.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are some differences with Italian,</v>

139
00:07:08.961 --> 00:07:09.794
<v Speaker 1>but there are also some of the things </v>
<v Speaker 1>that learners find challenging about </v>

140
00:07:11.931 --> 00:07:12.764
<v Speaker 1>French pronunciation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's finish by just breaking down a </v>

141
00:07:14.601 --> 00:07:18.020
<v Speaker 1>couple more sentences and seeing what </v>
<v Speaker 1>similarities and differences we notice.</v>

142
00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:20.720
<v Speaker 1>Here's the sentence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning what are your favorite dishes in</v>

143
00:07:20.721 --> 00:07:22.040
<v Speaker 1>Italian quality?</v>
<v Speaker 1>SONA,</v>

144
00:07:22.041 --> 00:07:25.150
<v Speaker 1>we've lost [inaudible]D in French,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kennison Ville,</v>

145
00:07:25.151 --> 00:07:25.761
<v Speaker 1>Platte,</v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible],</v>

146
00:07:25.761 --> 00:07:27.200
<v Speaker 1>la,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so word by word.</v>

147
00:07:27.201 --> 00:07:30.770
<v Speaker 1>The sentence is what are your plural </v>
<v Speaker 1>dishes?</v>

148
00:07:30.830 --> 00:07:31.663
<v Speaker 1>Plural.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Preferred quality and Ken are </v>

149
00:07:34.011 --> 00:07:34.844
<v Speaker 1>equivalents.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But notice that the plural ending is </v>

150
00:07:36.351 --> 00:07:37.370
<v Speaker 1>different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In Italian,</v>

151
00:07:37.371 --> 00:07:38.204
<v Speaker 1>it's often eat or act,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in French it's a silent s Somol and </v>

152
00:07:42.141 --> 00:07:42.974
<v Speaker 1>some are equivalents.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But notice that Somo ends in a vowel </v>

153
00:07:45.471 --> 00:07:50.471
<v Speaker 1>while some ends in a nasal sound and a </v>
<v Speaker 1>silent t evos three invo are equivalent,</v>

154
00:07:50.570 --> 00:07:51.403
<v Speaker 1>but in Italian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the definite article is normally used </v>

155
00:07:53.151 --> 00:07:54.950
<v Speaker 1>with a possessive pronoun like votes </v>
<v Speaker 1>three.</v>

156
00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:57.110
<v Speaker 1>While in French there's no definite </v>
<v Speaker 1>article,</v>

157
00:07:57.260 --> 00:07:58.093
<v Speaker 1>PRT and Pla or equivalent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but notice the different plural endings </v>

158
00:08:01.190 --> 00:08:05.180
<v Speaker 1>and notice that words with I and Italian</v>
<v Speaker 1>often have an l in French.</v>

159
00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:09.380
<v Speaker 1>We've seen another example of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the uncle in Italian and blog in French,</v>

160
00:08:10.730 --> 00:08:13.610
<v Speaker 1>but if fell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Iti and pressure are obvious equivalents</v>

161
00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:16.220
<v Speaker 1>just with different accent markings and </v>
<v Speaker 1>a different ending.</v>

162
00:08:17.630 --> 00:08:18.463
<v Speaker 1>Now here's one more pair of sentences,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this time I want you to have a look </v>

163
00:08:21.141 --> 00:08:21.974
<v Speaker 1>at them and notice the similarities and </v>
<v Speaker 1>differences without me breaking it down </v>

164
00:08:24.531 --> 00:08:28.850
<v Speaker 1>for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In Italian he knows three [inaudible] in</v>

165
00:08:28.851 --> 00:08:30.990
<v Speaker 1>French and those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean finish days unit.</v>

166
00:08:33.170 --> 00:08:34.003
<v Speaker 1>So I hope this video has made it clear </v>
<v Speaker 1>just how similar French and Italian </v>

167
00:08:36.321 --> 00:08:37.154
<v Speaker 1>really are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The speaker of one of them can probably </v>

168
00:08:38.571 --> 00:08:39.404
<v Speaker 1>learn the other quite easily and in </v>
<v Speaker 1>writing the level of mutual </v>

169
00:08:41.931 --> 00:08:42.764
<v Speaker 1>intelligibility is quite high.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But because the cognate words are all a </v>

170
00:08:45.441 --> 00:08:46.274
<v Speaker 1>little bit different,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and because of the pronunciation of the </v>

171
00:08:47.841 --> 00:08:48.674
<v Speaker 1>two languages is so different,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the two languages are not mutually </v>

172
00:08:51.081 --> 00:08:54.230
<v Speaker 1>intelligible in their spoken form.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But as a learner of Italian,</v>

173
00:08:54.231 --> 00:08:55.064
<v Speaker 1>my previous knowledge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>French makes a lot of things in Italian </v>

174
00:08:57.060 --> 00:08:57.893
<v Speaker 1>instantly clear to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the question of the day for speakers </v>

175
00:09:00.361 --> 00:09:01.194
<v Speaker 1>of French and Italian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how similar do you consider the two </v>

176
00:09:03.241 --> 00:09:06.090
<v Speaker 1>languages to be and to learners of </v>
<v Speaker 1>French and Italian?</v>

177
00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:09.420
<v Speaker 1>Does your knowledge of one of those </v>
<v Speaker 1>languages help you make any sense of the</v>

178
00:09:09.421 --> 00:09:10.254
<v Speaker 1>other or help you understand the other?</v>
