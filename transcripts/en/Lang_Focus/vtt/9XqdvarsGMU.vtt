<v Speaker 1>Hello everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Welcome to the Lange Focus Channel and </v>

3
00:00:07.411 --> 00:00:08.244
<v Speaker 1>my name is Paul.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Today we'll be talking about languages </v>

4
00:00:11.011 --> 00:00:14.250
<v Speaker 1>without verb tenses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>languages without verb tenses,</v>

5
00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:15.203
<v Speaker 1>how's that possible speakers of English </v>
<v Speaker 1>and other Indo European languages and I </v>

6
00:00:18.871 --> 00:00:19.704
<v Speaker 1>guess other languages too might take it </v>
<v Speaker 1>for granted that the basic features of </v>

7
00:00:22.861 --> 00:00:25.710
<v Speaker 1>their language must be present in other </v>
<v Speaker 1>languages as well,</v>

8
00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:26.663
<v Speaker 1>but that's not always the case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One example of this is verb tense using </v>

9
00:00:29.971 --> 00:00:33.960
<v Speaker 1>a particular form of a verb to show the </v>
<v Speaker 1>time period of an action past,</v>

10
00:00:33.961 --> 00:00:34.794
<v Speaker 1>present,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or future as they exist on a timeline </v>

11
00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.450
<v Speaker 1>and English.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We basically have these three tenses.</v>

12
00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:40.493
<v Speaker 1>Present tense is represented by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>simple verb stem like play for example </v>

13
00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:45.353
<v Speaker 1>with regular verbs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The past tense is represented by the </v>

14
00:00:47.461 --> 00:00:52.461
<v Speaker 1>stem plus the inflection ed like played </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the simple future tense is formed by</v>

15
00:00:53.341 --> 00:00:57.120
<v Speaker 1>placing the modal auxiliary verb will </v>
<v Speaker 1>before the infinitive,</v>

16
00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.050
<v Speaker 1>which is based on the verb stem minus </v>
<v Speaker 1>two for example,</v>

17
00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:01.913
<v Speaker 1>we'll play.</v>

18
00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:02.873
<v Speaker 1>Some linguists might argue that this </v>
<v Speaker 1>future form is not actually a verb </v>

19
00:01:05.791 --> 00:01:07.470
<v Speaker 1>tense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll come back to that later,</v>

20
00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.660
<v Speaker 1>but some languages don't have verb </v>
<v Speaker 1>tenses,</v>

21
00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.290
<v Speaker 1>meaning they don't have different verb </v>
<v Speaker 1>conjugations to show periods of time.</v>

22
00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.020
<v Speaker 1>This is true of many creole languages,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

23
00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:16.883
<v Speaker 1>of Indonesian and Malaysian of Chinese </v>
<v Speaker 1>have many native American languages and </v>

24
00:01:20.791 --> 00:01:23.370
<v Speaker 1>a lot more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's an example from Indonesian.</v>

25
00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.620
<v Speaker 1>Here's the verb,</v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning pay in the past,</v>

26
00:01:25.621 --> 00:01:26.454
<v Speaker 1>present and future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mumbai Outta the form of the verb is </v>

27
00:01:28.951 --> 00:01:32.910
<v Speaker 1>exactly the same and all three tenses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this might sound strange to you,</v>

28
00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:33.803
<v Speaker 1>how can they clearly communicate without</v>
<v Speaker 1>being able to say when an action takes </v>

29
00:01:36.721 --> 00:01:37.620
<v Speaker 1>place?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

30
00:01:37.621 --> 00:01:38.454
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's normally not that hard to guess </v>

31
00:01:39.961 --> 00:01:42.120
<v Speaker 1>from context.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just to illustrate,</v>

32
00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:42.983
<v Speaker 1>let's take the English word put,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the same in the present tense </v>

33
00:01:45.571 --> 00:01:46.404
<v Speaker 1>and past tense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I put my keys on the table so it was </v>

34
00:01:48.781 --> 00:01:49.614
<v Speaker 1>that sentence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>present tense or past tense in the </v>

35
00:01:51.871 --> 00:01:53.370
<v Speaker 1>middle of a story taking place.</v>

36
00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:55.680
<v Speaker 1>In the past it would probably be past </v>
<v Speaker 1>tense,</v>

37
00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.490
<v Speaker 1>but if someone were describing that </v>
<v Speaker 1>action as part of their daily after work</v>

38
00:01:59.491 --> 00:02:01.950
<v Speaker 1>routine than it would probably be </v>
<v Speaker 1>present tense.</v>

39
00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:04.500
<v Speaker 1>Context can clarify the time of an </v>
<v Speaker 1>action.</v>

40
00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:05.633
<v Speaker 1>Aside from general context.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are other ways of indicating when </v>

41
00:02:08.131 --> 00:02:08.964
<v Speaker 1>an action takes place first through our </v>
<v Speaker 1>words and expressions that indicate a </v>

42
00:02:11.971 --> 00:02:15.090
<v Speaker 1>specific time that the action takes </v>
<v Speaker 1>place like today,</v>

43
00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:16.380
<v Speaker 1>yesterday,</v>
<v Speaker 1>next week,</v>

44
00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:17.670
<v Speaker 1>last year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>et cetera.</v>

45
00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:21.000
<v Speaker 1>Second,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are adverbs that indicate aspect.</v>

46
00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:23.360
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the mum Biota,</v>

47
00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:26.420
<v Speaker 1>which basically means already paid sit </v>
<v Speaker 1>dung,</v>

48
00:02:26.421 --> 00:02:27.254
<v Speaker 1>Mumbai Iota,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which means in the process of paying </v>

49
00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:30.353
<v Speaker 1>Massey Mumbia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which means still paying these adverbs </v>

50
00:02:33.241 --> 00:02:34.074
<v Speaker 1>show aspect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's the difference between tensen </v>

51
00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:38.130
<v Speaker 1>aspect?</v>
<v Speaker 1>As I mentioned before,</v>

52
00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:41.040
<v Speaker 1>temps indicates the time period of an </v>
<v Speaker 1>action past,</v>

53
00:02:41.041 --> 00:02:41.874
<v Speaker 1>present,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or future aspect deals with the way </v>

54
00:02:43.681 --> 00:02:47.550
<v Speaker 1>actions unfold in relation to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>timeline rather than where they occur.</v>

55
00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:48.383
<v Speaker 1>On the timeline.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Suda shows that an action is completed </v>

56
00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:53.190
<v Speaker 1>with the focus on the result of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>action.</v>

57
00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:54.533
<v Speaker 1>We could call this perfect aspect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sit down marks the imperfection of </v>

58
00:02:57.631 --> 00:03:02.631
<v Speaker 1>aspect showing that an is in progress,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the action is not necessarily in the</v>

59
00:03:02.711 --> 00:03:03.544
<v Speaker 1>present tense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Massey also marks the imperfect of </v>

60
00:03:05.681 --> 00:03:08.290
<v Speaker 1>aspect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>showing that an action is continuing,</v>

61
00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:11.410
<v Speaker 1>but with an emphasis on the fact that </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not yet finished.</v>

62
00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:14.470
<v Speaker 1>These are just three of the many aspect </v>
<v Speaker 1>markers in Indonesian.</v>

63
00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:17.050
<v Speaker 1>Another language without tenses is </v>
<v Speaker 1>Mandarin.</v>

64
00:03:17.051 --> 00:03:17.884
<v Speaker 1>Chinese.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mentioned this in my video comparing </v>

65
00:03:20.021 --> 00:03:20.854
<v Speaker 1>Chinese and Japanese,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but unfortunately I messed up my </v>

66
00:03:22.991 --> 00:03:26.050
<v Speaker 1>explanation a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's the present tense sentence I gave</v>

67
00:03:26.051 --> 00:03:27.670
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That video will achieve.</v>

68
00:03:27.671 --> 00:03:30.370
<v Speaker 1>She sell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This means I go to school.</v>

69
00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:31.263
<v Speaker 1>The verb she is the same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No matter what period of time it takes </v>

70
00:03:34.331 --> 00:03:35.164
<v Speaker 1>place in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there are words that can be placed </v>

71
00:03:37.031 --> 00:03:39.520
<v Speaker 1>before or after the verb which show </v>
<v Speaker 1>aspect.</v>

72
00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:40.810
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it should I share.</v>

73
00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:46.000
<v Speaker 1>This means I went to school,</v>
<v Speaker 1>indicates the perfective aspect,</v>

74
00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:46.893
<v Speaker 1>viewing an action in its entirety </v>
<v Speaker 1>including its completion at a point in </v>

75
00:03:49.841 --> 00:03:52.150
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is often thought of as a past tense</v>

76
00:03:52.151 --> 00:03:52.984
<v Speaker 1>marker,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in certain contexts it can be used </v>

77
00:03:54.971 --> 00:03:56.830
<v Speaker 1>with future events.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

78
00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:03.550
<v Speaker 1>this means I'll call you after I've had </v>
<v Speaker 1>a meal tomorrow.</v>

79
00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:07.870
<v Speaker 1>Time can also be indicated with </v>
<v Speaker 1>time-related vocabulary,</v>

80
00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:09.860
<v Speaker 1>so let him what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chyna.</v>

81
00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:11.703
<v Speaker 1>This means yesterday I went to school.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can see that we've added the word </v>

82
00:04:14.561 --> 00:04:16.450
<v Speaker 1>for yesterday.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In this sentence,</v>

83
00:04:16.451 --> 00:04:17.284
<v Speaker 1>we actually still need the perfective </v>
<v Speaker 1>aspect marker because the verb here is </v>

84
00:04:20.531 --> 00:04:23.140
<v Speaker 1>an action verb with a definite start and</v>
<v Speaker 1>finish,</v>

85
00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:26.440
<v Speaker 1>but in some sentences the perfective </v>
<v Speaker 1>aspect marker is not needed,</v>

86
00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:29.280
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so let's will coc.</v>

87
00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:30.453
<v Speaker 1>This means yesterday I arrested here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no aspect marker and the only </v>

88
00:04:33.461 --> 00:04:36.100
<v Speaker 1>indication of time is the word meaning </v>
<v Speaker 1>yesterday.</v>

89
00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:39.850
<v Speaker 1>Here's a sentence with a different </v>
<v Speaker 1>aspect marker.</v>

90
00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:40.620
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sad.</v>

91
00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:42.110
<v Speaker 1>She she,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw the Lou Shannon.</v>

92
00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:43.263
<v Speaker 1>This means I'm on the way to school.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This word that shows in perfective </v>

93
00:04:46.721 --> 00:04:50.110
<v Speaker 1>aspect indicating an action that is in </v>
<v Speaker 1>progress and again,</v>

94
00:04:50.111 --> 00:04:54.430
<v Speaker 1>not necessarily in the present and this </v>
<v Speaker 1>part at the end here means on the road.</v>

95
00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:57.310
<v Speaker 1>These are two common aspect markers and </v>
<v Speaker 1>mandarin,</v>

96
00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:58.173
<v Speaker 1>but there are others.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The main thing to notice with the </v>

97
00:05:00.401 --> 00:05:04.540
<v Speaker 1>Indonesian and Mandarin examples is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>the verb itself has not conjugated.</v>

98
00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:08.380
<v Speaker 1>You simply place a different word and </v>
<v Speaker 1>aspect marker next to the verb.</v>

99
00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:11.830
<v Speaker 1>It's actually very common for languages </v>
<v Speaker 1>to not have tents,</v>

100
00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:15.640
<v Speaker 1>but I've never heard of a language that </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't have aspect in many languages.</v>

101
00:05:15.641 --> 00:05:16.474
<v Speaker 1>Tencent aspect combined together to form</v>
<v Speaker 1>various verb conjugations and many </v>

102
00:05:20.111 --> 00:05:22.870
<v Speaker 1>people really don't distinguish between </v>
<v Speaker 1>the two concepts.</v>

103
00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:23.793
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in English we have the present tense as </v>

104
00:05:25.481 --> 00:05:26.314
<v Speaker 1>in I work and we have another form I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>working which is in the present tense </v>

105
00:05:30.101 --> 00:05:30.934
<v Speaker 1>but with progressive aspect and we have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have worked which is in the present </v>

106
00:05:34.541 --> 00:05:35.374
<v Speaker 1>tense but with perfect aspect showing a </v>
<v Speaker 1>connection between a past event and the </v>

107
00:05:38.951 --> 00:05:39.610
<v Speaker 1>present.</v>

108
00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:43.030
<v Speaker 1>People tend to think of all of these </v>
<v Speaker 1>different verb constructions as tenses,</v>

109
00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:45.670
<v Speaker 1>but strictly speaking there is more than</v>
<v Speaker 1>just tense there.</v>

110
00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:46.563
<v Speaker 1>There are certain languages that do have</v>
<v Speaker 1>tenses but not all of them in </v>

111
00:05:49.121 --> 00:05:49.954
<v Speaker 1>particular.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's quite common for languages to show </v>

112
00:05:51.471 --> 00:05:54.160
<v Speaker 1>no distinction between present tense and</v>
<v Speaker 1>future tense.</v>

113
00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:56.260
<v Speaker 1>This is the case with Japanese for </v>
<v Speaker 1>example,</v>

114
00:05:56.261 --> 00:05:57.094
<v Speaker 1>which has two tenses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Past and non past could mean I eat </v>

115
00:06:01.791 --> 00:06:02.624
<v Speaker 1>Japanese food in the general sense or </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll eat Japanese food in a specific </v>

116
00:06:06.921 --> 00:06:07.820
<v Speaker 1>case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In the future.</v>

117
00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:08.713
<v Speaker 1>It's normally not hard to tell the </v>
<v Speaker 1>difference based on context and there's </v>

118
00:06:11.421 --> 00:06:13.910
<v Speaker 1>another form Tay you do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or t Mohs,</v>

119
00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:14.863
<v Speaker 1>which represents a continuing action or </v>
<v Speaker 1>continuing state incorporating uses of </v>

120
00:06:18.381 --> 00:06:20.810
<v Speaker 1>both progressive as well as perfect </v>
<v Speaker 1>aspect.</v>

121
00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:23.600
<v Speaker 1>People often think this is strictly a </v>
<v Speaker 1>present tense form,</v>

122
00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:25.790
<v Speaker 1>but it can also be used for future </v>
<v Speaker 1>actions.</v>

123
00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:26.683
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sentence means I can't believe that </v>

124
00:06:34.191 --> 00:06:37.220
<v Speaker 1>around this time next week I'll already </v>
<v Speaker 1>be living in Canada.</v>

125
00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:38.463
<v Speaker 1>Here you can see that the verb say </v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] is in the Teo to form </v>

126
00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:42.643
<v Speaker 1>representing progressive aspect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the action takes place in the </v>

127
00:06:45.111 --> 00:06:45.944
<v Speaker 1>future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Many linguists would even argue that </v>

128
00:06:47.571 --> 00:06:48.404
<v Speaker 1>English has no future tense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's because there are no inflections </v>

129
00:06:50.961 --> 00:06:51.794
<v Speaker 1>on the main verb to show future tense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's shown instead using a modal </v>

130
00:06:54.861 --> 00:06:55.694
<v Speaker 1>auxiliary specifically will modal </v>
<v Speaker 1>Auxiliaries and general indicate </v>

131
00:06:59.031 --> 00:07:01.820
<v Speaker 1>likelihood ability,</v>
<v Speaker 1>permission and obligation.</v>

132
00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:02.833
<v Speaker 1>We'll does express future action,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but syntactically it works like a modal </v>

133
00:07:06.141 --> 00:07:06.974
<v Speaker 1>auxiliary and there's also the </v>
<v Speaker 1>construction going to which can be </v>

134
00:07:10.071 --> 00:07:12.590
<v Speaker 1>placed in front of the main verb,</v>
<v Speaker 1>indicate the future.</v>

135
00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:13.813
<v Speaker 1>Semantically speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>English can express the meaning of the </v>

136
00:07:15.891 --> 00:07:16.724
<v Speaker 1>future tense using these constructions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but grammatically they're not really a </v>

137
00:07:19.751 --> 00:07:21.140
<v Speaker 1>future tense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But again,</v>

138
00:07:21.141 --> 00:07:24.170
<v Speaker 1>most people tend to think of that as the</v>
<v Speaker 1>future tense in English.</v>

139
00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:25.273
<v Speaker 1>Indeed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many of the verb forms that we tend to </v>

140
00:07:26.751 --> 00:07:30.170
<v Speaker 1>think of as tenses include elements </v>
<v Speaker 1>other than tents.</v>

141
00:07:30.350 --> 00:07:31.183
<v Speaker 1>Take French for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is usually thought to have 14 </v>

142
00:07:33.681 --> 00:07:34.514
<v Speaker 1>tenses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>seven simple tenses and seven compound </v>

143
00:07:36.741 --> 00:07:39.470
<v Speaker 1>tenses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the seven compound tenses contain an</v>

144
00:07:39.471 --> 00:07:40.304
<v Speaker 1>element of aspect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Show them through the use of auxiliary </v>

145
00:07:42.651 --> 00:07:43.484
<v Speaker 1>verbs and the conditional and </v>
<v Speaker 1>subjunctive forms show distinctions in </v>

146
00:07:46.221 --> 00:07:47.054
<v Speaker 1>mood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The conditional form suggests that one </v>

147
00:07:48.951 --> 00:07:49.784
<v Speaker 1>action is dependent upon another and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>subjunctive form indicates desire or </v>

148
00:07:53.391 --> 00:07:54.224
<v Speaker 1>probability.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These are moods and even though they </v>

149
00:07:56.091 --> 00:07:59.810
<v Speaker 1>have separate verb forms and are often </v>
<v Speaker 1>referred to as separate tenses,</v>

150
00:07:59.930 --> 00:08:00.763
<v Speaker 1>they really express both tents and mood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So verb tenses may work differently in </v>

151
00:08:04.581 --> 00:08:05.414
<v Speaker 1>different languages,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and some languages may lack grammatical </v>

152
00:08:07.611 --> 00:08:08.444
<v Speaker 1>verb tense entirely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that doesn't mean that they can't </v>

153
00:08:10.431 --> 00:08:12.980
<v Speaker 1>express those different time periods in </v>
<v Speaker 1>other ways,</v>

154
00:08:13.070 --> 00:08:13.903
<v Speaker 1>whether from context,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the use of time expressions like </v>

155
00:08:16.041 --> 00:08:19.850
<v Speaker 1>tomorrow from the use of aspect or from </v>
<v Speaker 1>the use of modal auxiliaries,</v>

156
00:08:20.030 --> 00:08:22.940
<v Speaker 1>when some people hear that there are </v>
<v Speaker 1>languages with no verb tense,</v>

157
00:08:22.941 --> 00:08:26.780
<v Speaker 1>they imagined that the speakers of these</v>
<v Speaker 1>languages have no understanding of time,</v>

158
00:08:26.781 --> 00:08:27.614
<v Speaker 1>that they can't plan for the future or </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they can't remember the past or </v>

159
00:08:30.141 --> 00:08:30.980
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

160
00:08:31.070 --> 00:08:34.310
<v Speaker 1>But that's not the case at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're all humans after all,</v>

161
00:08:34.311 --> 00:08:37.370
<v Speaker 1>and we all find ways to communicate the </v>
<v Speaker 1>same basic things.</v>

162
00:08:37.430 --> 00:08:38.263
<v Speaker 1>The question of the day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>does your language have special verb </v>

163
00:08:40.401 --> 00:08:42.230
<v Speaker 1>forms to express past,</v>
<v Speaker 1>present,</v>

164
00:08:42.231 --> 00:08:43.064
<v Speaker 1>and future?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does your language contain a large </v>

165
00:08:44.661 --> 00:08:47.450
<v Speaker 1>number of tenses that incorporate aspect</v>
<v Speaker 1>and mood?</v>

166
00:08:47.690 --> 00:08:48.523
<v Speaker 1>If you're not quite sure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe look it up and find out a little </v>

167
00:08:50.421 --> 00:08:52.760
<v Speaker 1>bit about it and tell us in the comments</v>
