1
00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:01.043
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I've had a lot of requests for a </v>

2
00:00:02.191 --> 00:00:03.024
<v Speaker 1>video on the North Germanic languages.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So today I present to you a video on </v>

3
00:00:06.631 --> 00:00:08.130
<v Speaker 1>Swedish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Norwegian,</v>

4
00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:09.660
<v Speaker 1>Danish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Finnish.</v>

5
00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:12.993
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>

6
00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.953
<v Speaker 1>Hello everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Welcome to the Lange Focus Channel and </v>

7
00:00:19.761 --> 00:00:20.594
<v Speaker 1>my name is Paula.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Today I'm going to talk about the north </v>

8
00:00:22.521 --> 00:00:23.354
<v Speaker 1>Germanic languages of the Nordic nations</v>
<v Speaker 1>that includes the Scandinavian </v>

9
00:00:26.721 --> 00:00:27.890
<v Speaker 1>languages,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Swedish,</v>

10
00:00:27.891 --> 00:00:29.240
<v Speaker 1>Danish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Norwegian.</v>

11
00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:32.990
<v Speaker 1>And I will also touch on the languages </v>
<v Speaker 1>of Icelandic and federal wheeze.</v>

12
00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:34.003
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to call this video at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Scandinavian languages because I just </v>

13
00:00:36.621 --> 00:00:38.900
<v Speaker 1>love the way that word sounds </v>
<v Speaker 1>Scandinavian,</v>

14
00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.853
<v Speaker 1>but to the people of that region.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The word Scandinavian only refers to </v>

15
00:00:42.801 --> 00:00:43.850
<v Speaker 1>Denmark,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sweden,</v>

16
00:00:43.851 --> 00:00:44.684
<v Speaker 1>and Norway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and not to the other countries that I </v>

17
00:00:46.371 --> 00:00:49.520
<v Speaker 1>want to talk about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if I say the Nordic nations,</v>

18
00:00:49.521 --> 00:00:52.040
<v Speaker 1>that also includes Iceland,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Faroe Islands,</v>

19
00:00:52.041 --> 00:00:52.874
<v Speaker 1>as well as Finland.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to talk about the north Germanic </v>

20
00:00:55.191 --> 00:00:57.140
<v Speaker 1>languages spoken in all of those </v>
<v Speaker 1>countries.</v>

21
00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:58.003
<v Speaker 1>So I decided on the title and the North </v>
<v Speaker 1>Germanic languages of the Nordic </v>

22
00:01:00.831 --> 00:01:01.664
<v Speaker 1>nations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And please note that finish is not in </v>

23
00:01:03.711 --> 00:01:06.800
<v Speaker 1>north dramatic language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It belongs to a separate language family</v>

24
00:01:06.801 --> 00:01:07.634
<v Speaker 1>entirely.</v>

25
00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.830
<v Speaker 1>There are about 20 million native </v>
<v Speaker 1>speakers of North Germanic languages,</v>

26
00:01:13.831 --> 00:01:16.770
<v Speaker 1>and that includes about 9 million </v>
<v Speaker 1>speakers of Swedish,</v>

27
00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:17.753
<v Speaker 1>mainly in Sweden,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also as a minority language in </v>

28
00:01:19.651 --> 00:01:22.080
<v Speaker 1>Finland.</v>
<v Speaker 1>6 million speakers of Danish,</v>

29
00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:22.943
<v Speaker 1>mainly in Denmark,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also as a minority language in the </v>

30
00:01:24.991 --> 00:01:28.380
<v Speaker 1>southern less vague region of northern </v>
<v Speaker 1>Germany and in Greenland,</v>

31
00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:31.050
<v Speaker 1>5 million speakers of Norwegian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mainly in Norway,</v>

32
00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.990
<v Speaker 1>320,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>speakers of Icelandic,</v>

33
00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:35.940
<v Speaker 1>mainly in Iceland.</v>
<v Speaker 1>90,000</v>

34
00:01:35.941 --> 00:01:36.774
<v Speaker 1>speakers of feral wheeze.</v>
<v Speaker 1>About two thirds of them living in the </v>

35
00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.040
<v Speaker 1>Faroe Islands and the rest of mainly in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Denmark.</v>

36
00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.100
<v Speaker 1>The North Germanic languages are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as you probably guessed,</v>

37
00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.350
<v Speaker 1>a branch of the dramatic language </v>
<v Speaker 1>family.</v>

38
00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.620
<v Speaker 1>All dramatic language is developed from </v>
<v Speaker 1>Proto Germanic,</v>

39
00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:50.483
<v Speaker 1>which was spoken around 500 bce.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Frodo Germanic possibly originated in </v>

40
00:01:54.451 --> 00:01:55.284
<v Speaker 1>Scandinavia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and different varieties of dramatic </v>

41
00:01:57.241 --> 00:01:58.074
<v Speaker 1>began to emerge with migration.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Runic inscriptions from the second </v>

42
00:02:01.021 --> 00:02:01.854
<v Speaker 1>century ce show us that by that time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pro dramatic had began to separate into </v>

43
00:02:05.671 --> 00:02:08.520
<v Speaker 1>distinct western,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eastern and northern dialects.</v>

44
00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:09.653
<v Speaker 1>The northern dialect was spoken in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Scandinavia and is today often referred </v>

45
00:02:12.601 --> 00:02:13.434
<v Speaker 1>to as Prato norse and became the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ancestor of all the north Germanic </v>

46
00:02:16.921 --> 00:02:19.170
<v Speaker 1>languages.</v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] north was spoken from around</v>

47
00:02:19.171 --> 00:02:20.004
<v Speaker 1>the second century Ce to the eighth </v>
<v Speaker 1>century ce and by the beginning of the </v>

48
00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:25.043
<v Speaker 1>Viking era in the eighth century ce,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it had evolved into dialects that are </v>

49
00:02:27.691 --> 00:02:32.070
<v Speaker 1>collectively referred to as old norse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>During the next few hundred years,</v>

50
00:02:32.071 --> 00:02:32.904
<v Speaker 1>vikings seafaring norse people explored </v>
<v Speaker 1>much of Europe by sea and river </v>

51
00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:37.133
<v Speaker 1>conquering lands and establishing </v>
<v Speaker 1>settlements and bringing their language </v>

52
00:02:39.811 --> 00:02:41.520
<v Speaker 1>with them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>During this time,</v>

53
00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:42.413
<v Speaker 1>old north was divided into three </v>
<v Speaker 1>mutually intelligible dialects of old </v>

54
00:02:45.811 --> 00:02:46.470
<v Speaker 1>east,</v>
<v Speaker 1>north,</v>

55
00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:48.600
<v Speaker 1>old west,</v>
<v Speaker 1>north and old goodness.</v>

56
00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:49.793
<v Speaker 1>All these north was spoken in Sweden and</v>
<v Speaker 1>Denmark as well as their overseas </v>

57
00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:53.513
<v Speaker 1>settlements in Russia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>England and in Danish settlements in </v>

58
00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:56.403
<v Speaker 1>Normandy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Old West North was spoken in Norway as </v>

59
00:02:58.771 --> 00:02:59.604
<v Speaker 1>well as its overseas settlements.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The two most notable where Iceland and </v>

60
00:03:02.381 --> 00:03:04.540
<v Speaker 1>the Faroe Islands,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also Ireland,</v>

61
00:03:04.541 --> 00:03:05.374
<v Speaker 1>Scotland,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the isle of Man and Norwegian </v>

62
00:03:07.031 --> 00:03:07.864
<v Speaker 1>settlements in Norman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>deep old goodness was mainly spoken on </v>

63
00:03:10.061 --> 00:03:13.060
<v Speaker 1>the island of Gotland,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is today part of Sweden as well as</v>

64
00:03:13.061 --> 00:03:14.740
<v Speaker 1>some overseas settlements to the east.</v>

65
00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:15.903
<v Speaker 1>These west East and goodness varieties </v>
<v Speaker 1>of old norse gradually developed into </v>

66
00:03:19.601 --> 00:03:23.110
<v Speaker 1>the modern north Germanic languages.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Around the 14th century CE.</v>

67
00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:26.110
<v Speaker 1>The Western branch of languages consists</v>
<v Speaker 1>of Norwegian,</v>

68
00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:29.860
<v Speaker 1>Icelandic and Pharaoh weeds as well as </v>
<v Speaker 1>some other extinct languages.</v>

69
00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:33.160
<v Speaker 1>The eastern branch consists of Swedish </v>
<v Speaker 1>and Danish.</v>

70
00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:36.040
<v Speaker 1>The goodness branch consists of only the</v>
<v Speaker 1>good initial language,</v>

71
00:03:36.041 --> 00:03:38.830
<v Speaker 1>which is still spoken to some extent on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the island of Gotland,</v>

72
00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:40.023
<v Speaker 1>but these days the north dramatic </v>
<v Speaker 1>languages are generally not thought of </v>

73
00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:44.260
<v Speaker 1>in terms of east,</v>
<v Speaker 1>west and goodness.</v>

74
00:03:44.261 --> 00:03:47.140
<v Speaker 1>They are thought of in terms of </v>
<v Speaker 1>continental and insular.</v>

75
00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:48.183
<v Speaker 1>The continental languages are Danish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Swedish and Norwegian and the insular </v>

76
00:03:51.431 --> 00:03:53.500
<v Speaker 1>languages.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Our Icelandic and Pharaoh ease.</v>

77
00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:54.513
<v Speaker 1>These categories are based on the mutual</v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligibility of the languages rather </v>

78
00:03:57.521 --> 00:04:00.280
<v Speaker 1>than on the genetic root language that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they come from.</v>

79
00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:04.660
<v Speaker 1>Norwegian is grouped with Swedish and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Danish because even though Icelandic and</v>

80
00:04:04.661 --> 00:04:07.090
<v Speaker 1>Norwegian developed from the same old </v>
<v Speaker 1>west,</v>

81
00:04:07.091 --> 00:04:11.050
<v Speaker 1>North's Norwegian is today much more </v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligible with Swedish and Danish.</v>

82
00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:16.990
<v Speaker 1>One reason for that is the political </v>
<v Speaker 1>union of Denmark and Norway from 1536 to</v>

83
00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:17.863
<v Speaker 1>1814 during this time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the written Norwegian language stopped </v>

84
00:04:20.651 --> 00:04:21.484
<v Speaker 1>being used and it was replaced by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>written Danish language and this had a </v>

85
00:04:24.401 --> 00:04:27.100
<v Speaker 1>big impact on the spoken dialect of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Norwegian,</v>

86
00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:29.620
<v Speaker 1>especially the central and eastern </v>
<v Speaker 1>dialects.</v>

87
00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:33.550
<v Speaker 1>The continental languages also underwent</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of influence from middle,</v>

88
00:04:33.551 --> 00:04:36.190
<v Speaker 1>low German,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is an influence that didn't effect</v>

89
00:04:36.191 --> 00:04:37.024
<v Speaker 1>Icelandic and fairways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The three continental languages can be </v>

90
00:04:39.641 --> 00:04:42.040
<v Speaker 1>referred to as the Scandinavian </v>
<v Speaker 1>languages.</v>

91
00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:44.320
<v Speaker 1>When talking about the Scandinavian </v>
<v Speaker 1>languages,</v>

92
00:04:44.321 --> 00:04:45.154
<v Speaker 1>it's important to note that there is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>significant amount of dialectal </v>

93
00:04:47.411 --> 00:04:50.170
<v Speaker 1>variation within each language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

94
00:04:50.171 --> 00:04:52.840
<v Speaker 1>the three languages are made up of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>dialect continuum.</v>

95
00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:54.940
<v Speaker 1>That means if you travel in one </v>
<v Speaker 1>direction,</v>

96
00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:57.610
<v Speaker 1>the dialects gradually change the </v>
<v Speaker 1>further you go.</v>

97
00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:58.720
<v Speaker 1>That means,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

98
00:04:58.721 --> 00:05:01.480
<v Speaker 1>that if you are a Norwegian living near </v>
<v Speaker 1>the border with Sweden,</v>

99
00:05:01.481 --> 00:05:02.314
<v Speaker 1>you probably have an easier time </v>
<v Speaker 1>understanding your neighbor just across </v>

100
00:05:04.781 --> 00:05:05.620
<v Speaker 1>the border in Sweden.</v>

101
00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:08.620
<v Speaker 1>Then you do a Norwegian from the other </v>
<v Speaker 1>side of the country.</v>

102
00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:09.663
<v Speaker 1>Even though you are supposedly speaking </v>
<v Speaker 1>a different language from that Swedish </v>

103
00:05:12.401 --> 00:05:13.234
<v Speaker 1>person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This makes it kind of hard to determine </v>

104
00:05:14.681 --> 00:05:15.514
<v Speaker 1>at what point these dialects become </v>
<v Speaker 1>different languages or if they are in </v>

105
00:05:17.981 --> 00:05:21.400
<v Speaker 1>fact different languages at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The three languages are all more or less</v>

106
00:05:21.401 --> 00:05:22.234
<v Speaker 1>intelligible depending on where the </v>
<v Speaker 1>dialect lies on that continuum and the </v>

107
00:05:25.421 --> 00:05:28.030
<v Speaker 1>written languages are almost entirely </v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligible.</v>

108
00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:29.073
<v Speaker 1>Danish seems to be the odd man out with </v>
<v Speaker 1>its complex phonology that has come to </v>

109
00:05:32.441 --> 00:05:34.540
<v Speaker 1>be quite distinct from the written </v>
<v Speaker 1>language.</v>

110
00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:35.613
<v Speaker 1>Swedes and Norwegians often say that </v>
<v Speaker 1>Danish people sound like they're </v>

111
00:05:37.721 --> 00:05:38.554
<v Speaker 1>speaking with a potato in their mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't actually confirm if they do </v>

112
00:05:41.621 --> 00:05:44.020
<v Speaker 1>speak with a potato in their mouth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so scandinavians,</v>

113
00:05:44.021 --> 00:05:46.570
<v Speaker 1>can you let me know if that's true in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the comments down below?</v>

114
00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:49.450
<v Speaker 1>I have Danish roots,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'm allowed to make fun of Dan's from</v>

115
00:05:49.451 --> 00:05:50.284
<v Speaker 1>what I understand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no regions have the easiest time </v>

116
00:05:51.851 --> 00:05:54.460
<v Speaker 1>understanding the other two Scandinavian</v>
<v Speaker 1>languages,</v>

117
00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:56.950
<v Speaker 1>though they understand Swedish better </v>
<v Speaker 1>than Danish.</v>

118
00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:59.470
<v Speaker 1>Swedes can generally understand or </v>
<v Speaker 1>region,</v>

119
00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:00.313
<v Speaker 1>but they have much more trouble </v>
<v Speaker 1>understanding Danish because of its </v>

120
00:06:02.481 --> 00:06:03.314
<v Speaker 1>pronunciation and Danes can more or less</v>
<v Speaker 1>understand Norwegian and to a lesser </v>

121
00:06:07.041 --> 00:06:10.220
<v Speaker 1>extent they can understand some Swedish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>From what I understand,</v>

122
00:06:10.221 --> 00:06:13.640
<v Speaker 1>Scandinavians will generally not speak </v>
<v Speaker 1>the other person's language.</v>

123
00:06:13.641 --> 00:06:17.480
<v Speaker 1>They will speak their own language while</v>
<v Speaker 1>making an effort to understand the other</v>

124
00:06:17.481 --> 00:06:21.470
<v Speaker 1>person's speech and maybe they will slow</v>
<v Speaker 1>down and clarify things when necessary,</v>

125
00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:24.290
<v Speaker 1>but when they have significant trouble </v>
<v Speaker 1>communicating,</v>

126
00:06:24.291 --> 00:06:25.124
<v Speaker 1>they might switch to English,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which isn't that tough for them because </v>

127
00:06:27.471 --> 00:06:30.770
<v Speaker 1>Scandinavians are magical geniuses when </v>
<v Speaker 1>it comes to learning English.</v>

128
00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:31.783
<v Speaker 1>In this kind of situation where you have</v>
<v Speaker 1>three closely related languages that </v>

129
00:06:34.491 --> 00:06:35.324
<v Speaker 1>kind of blend together on a continuum,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the languages are not defined by the </v>

130
00:06:38.391 --> 00:06:39.224
<v Speaker 1>spoken variety but rather by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>official standard language associated </v>

131
00:06:42.471 --> 00:06:44.660
<v Speaker 1>with that country or region.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In Denmark,</v>

132
00:06:44.661 --> 00:06:45.494
<v Speaker 1>there a standard Danish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In Sweden there is standard Swedish and </v>

133
00:06:48.261 --> 00:06:51.020
<v Speaker 1>in Norway there is standard Norwegian or</v>
<v Speaker 1>wait,</v>

134
00:06:51.021 --> 00:06:51.854
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there they're actually two standard </v>

135
00:06:52.761 --> 00:06:53.594
<v Speaker 1>Norwegians.</v>

136
00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:54.890
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

137
00:06:54.890 --> 00:06:55.723
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Norway actually has two official </v>

138
00:06:57.231 --> 00:07:01.250
<v Speaker 1>standard written languages,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bulk and Nina Osc book model,</v>

139
00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:04.970
<v Speaker 1>which means book language is a Danish </v>
<v Speaker 1>influenced standard language,</v>

140
00:07:04.971 --> 00:07:05.804
<v Speaker 1>which is very close to standard Danish </v>
<v Speaker 1>but which uses Norwegian pronunciation </v>

141
00:07:09.150 --> 00:07:09.983
<v Speaker 1>and knows or new Norwegian is intended </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be a pure version of Norwegian based </v>

142
00:07:14.601 --> 00:07:17.120
<v Speaker 1>on Norway is more conservative Western </v>
<v Speaker 1>dialect.</v>

143
00:07:17.470 --> 00:07:17.760
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

144
00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:20.220
<v Speaker 1>Which Standard Language Norwegians are </v>
<v Speaker 1>educated in,</v>

145
00:07:20.221 --> 00:07:24.060
<v Speaker 1>depends on the region they grow up in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But despite having two official standard</v>

146
00:07:24.061 --> 00:07:26.610
<v Speaker 1>languages,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Norwegians don't really speak them.</v>

147
00:07:26.730 --> 00:07:27.563
<v Speaker 1>Norwegians generally speak their own </v>
<v Speaker 1>local dialect whenever they are </v>

148
00:07:30.271 --> 00:07:31.104
<v Speaker 1>speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even in formal situations and even when </v>

149
00:07:32.821 --> 00:07:35.610
<v Speaker 1>they're speaking to people from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>other Scandinavian countries.</v>

150
00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:36.473
<v Speaker 1>Because if this Norwegians have to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>used to understanding a wide variety of </v>

151
00:07:39.511 --> 00:07:40.344
<v Speaker 1>spoken dialects and that's probably part</v>
<v Speaker 1>of what makes it easier for them to </v>

152
00:07:42.901 --> 00:07:43.734
<v Speaker 1>understand Swedish and Danish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that of course this is just my </v>

153
00:07:46.021 --> 00:07:47.670
<v Speaker 1>speculation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So native speakers,</v>

154
00:07:47.671 --> 00:07:48.504
<v Speaker 1>you can confirm or disconfirm that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's take a look at the three </v>

155
00:07:51.271 --> 00:07:54.180
<v Speaker 1>continental languages and see just how </v>
<v Speaker 1>similar they are.</v>

156
00:07:54.390 --> 00:07:55.223
<v Speaker 1>Unfortunately,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't able to find a volunteer to </v>

157
00:07:56.911 --> 00:07:57.744
<v Speaker 1>help me with the Danish sentences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But let's look at Norwegian and Swedish </v>

158
00:08:00.931 --> 00:08:01.764
<v Speaker 1>and that will give you a general idea of</v>
<v Speaker 1>how similar the continental languages </v>

159
00:08:04.981 --> 00:08:06.720
<v Speaker 1>are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love you</v>

160
00:08:07.690 --> 00:08:08.250
<v Speaker 3>y'all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ed.</v>

161
00:08:08.250 --> 00:08:10.700
<v Speaker 3>Skip Day ends today.</v>

162
00:08:12.370 --> 00:08:12.640
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

163
00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:15.000
<v Speaker 3>Dogs are the best pets.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hmm Dad,</v>

164
00:08:15.130 --> 00:08:19.500
<v Speaker 3>Adam Besta who's viewed as the best </v>
<v Speaker 3>shall indeed.</v>

165
00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:22.510
<v Speaker 4>Tomorrow I will go to Germany.</v>

166
00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:28.320
<v Speaker 3>You Marvin sky cutting this clans Emr </v>
<v Speaker 3>Scalia draw to this client.</v>

167
00:08:30.350 --> 00:08:33.760
<v Speaker 3>The party was fun because I liked the </v>
<v Speaker 3>music part.</v>

168
00:08:33.910 --> 00:08:38.910
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] part is far more so for the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeti Tennessee Cam.</v>

169
00:08:41.570 --> 00:08:42.010
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

170
00:08:42.010 --> 00:08:42.843
<v Speaker 1>So you can probably see just how similar</v>
<v Speaker 1>these three languages are and you can </v>

171
00:08:45.461 --> 00:08:46.294
<v Speaker 1>probably see how relatively speaking </v>
<v Speaker 1>they are easy for English speakers to </v>

172
00:08:49.421 --> 00:08:50.254
<v Speaker 1>learn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They are all category one languages </v>

173
00:08:51.970 --> 00:08:54.430
<v Speaker 1>according to the American Foreign </v>
<v Speaker 1>Service Institute,</v>

174
00:08:54.431 --> 00:08:57.180
<v Speaker 1>which trains for their overseas </v>
<v Speaker 1>assignments.</v>

175
00:08:57.450 --> 00:09:01.080
<v Speaker 1>None of the north dramatic languages are</v>
<v Speaker 1>amongst the most widely spoken languages</v>

176
00:09:01.081 --> 00:09:01.914
<v Speaker 1>in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And people from the Nordic countries </v>

177
00:09:03.421 --> 00:09:04.254
<v Speaker 1>generally speak excellent English.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So is it a waste of time to learn a </v>

178
00:09:07.081 --> 00:09:09.060
<v Speaker 1>north Germanic language?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course not.</v>

179
00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:12.240
<v Speaker 1>If you're interested in the cultures and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the history of that region,</v>

180
00:09:12.241 --> 00:09:15.000
<v Speaker 1>then learning one of the languages could</v>
<v Speaker 1>bring you immense joy.</v>

181
00:09:15.210 --> 00:09:18.300
<v Speaker 1>And because the three Scandinavian </v>
<v Speaker 1>languages are so similar,</v>

182
00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:21.090
<v Speaker 1>learning one of them can unlock the </v>
<v Speaker 1>doors to the other ones,</v>

183
00:09:21.091 --> 00:09:21.924
<v Speaker 1>especially of the written languages.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you're an avid traveler or you </v>

184
00:09:24.721 --> 00:09:28.230
<v Speaker 1>want to go backpacking around the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you will probably meet a surprising</v>

185
00:09:28.231 --> 00:09:29.064
<v Speaker 1>number of Scandinavians and knowing </v>
<v Speaker 1>their language or even one of the other </v>

186
00:09:31.651 --> 00:09:32.484
<v Speaker 1>two languages will help you break the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ice and get to know some wonderful and </v>

187
00:09:35.460 --> 00:09:37.320
<v Speaker 1>possibly highly attractive people.</v>

188
00:09:37.470 --> 00:09:39.960
<v Speaker 1>And if you are interested in the old </v>
<v Speaker 1>Nordic cultures,</v>

189
00:09:39.961 --> 00:09:40.794
<v Speaker 1>then you might benefit from learning </v>
<v Speaker 1>Icelandic since written Icelandic is </v>

190
00:09:43.471 --> 00:09:44.304
<v Speaker 1>still very similar to old norse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so don't hesitate to start learning one </v>

191
00:09:47.401 --> 00:09:48.234
<v Speaker 1>of the north Germanic languages,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which could be your portal into a whole </v>

192
00:09:51.001 --> 00:09:53.340
<v Speaker 1>new world itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The question of the day,</v>

193
00:09:53.370 --> 00:09:55.680
<v Speaker 1>native speakers of north dramatic </v>
<v Speaker 1>languages,</v>

194
00:09:55.710 --> 00:09:58.830
<v Speaker 1>what does your experience communicating </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the speakers of other languages?</v>

195
00:09:58.831 --> 00:09:59.664
<v Speaker 1>Which of the other languages do you </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand the most and how do you </v>

196
00:10:01.741 --> 00:10:05.970
<v Speaker 1>bridge that communication gap?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'd like to know and everyone else jump</v>

197
00:10:05.971 --> 00:10:09.790
<v Speaker 1>in and leave whatever comments you want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank you for watching and have a nice,</v>

198
00:10:11.990 --> 00:10:12.823
<v Speaker 5>sure.</v>
