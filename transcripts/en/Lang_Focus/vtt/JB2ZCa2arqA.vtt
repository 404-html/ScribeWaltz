1
00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:04.620
<v Speaker 1>How similar are Japanese and Korean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The.</v>

2
00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:07.080
<v Speaker 1>Hold on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

3
00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:12.200
<v Speaker 1>Now we can start.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hello everyone.</v>

4
00:00:14.791 --> 00:00:17.820
<v Speaker 1>Welcome to the Lange Focus Channel and </v>
<v Speaker 1>my name is Paul.</v>

5
00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.530
<v Speaker 1>How similar our Japanese and Korean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is the question of the day.</v>

6
00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:23.603
<v Speaker 1>Japan and Korea are geographically very </v>
<v Speaker 1>close to each other and at first glance </v>

7
00:00:27.241 --> 00:00:30.660
<v Speaker 1>they look like similar countries with </v>
<v Speaker 1>similar cultures in a way,</v>

8
00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.470
<v Speaker 1>but just how similar are the Japanese </v>
<v Speaker 1>and Korean languages?</v>

9
00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:35.543
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the short answer is they are closer to </v>

10
00:00:37.051 --> 00:00:37.884
<v Speaker 1>each other than they are to any other </v>
<v Speaker 1>languages and they are remarkably </v>

11
00:00:40.561 --> 00:00:41.394
<v Speaker 1>similar in some ways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in other ways they're also very </v>

12
00:00:43.591 --> 00:00:46.710
<v Speaker 1>different and they are certainly not </v>
<v Speaker 1>mutually intelligible.</v>

13
00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:49.380
<v Speaker 1>Disclaimer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't speak very much Korean,</v>

14
00:00:49.381 --> 00:00:50.214
<v Speaker 1>but I do speak Japanese and I am aware </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the differences and similarities </v>

15
00:00:53.521 --> 00:00:54.354
<v Speaker 1>between them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's look at the similarities in terms </v>

16
00:00:56.071 --> 00:00:57.510
<v Speaker 1>of grammar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>vocabulary,</v>

17
00:00:57.511 --> 00:00:59.700
<v Speaker 1>pronunciation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the writing systems.</v>

18
00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:04.050
<v Speaker 1>When it comes to syntax and grammar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Japanese and Korean are very similar.</v>

19
00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:05.093
<v Speaker 1>Japanese and Korean sentences can often </v>
<v Speaker 1>be translated word by word with each </v>

20
00:01:08.971 --> 00:01:11.880
<v Speaker 1>word in one sentence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>having an equivalent in the other.</v>

21
00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:15.480
<v Speaker 1>Let's look at a couple of Korean and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Japanese sentences side by side,</v>

22
00:01:15.481 --> 00:01:17.550
<v Speaker 1>and we can see the similarities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>

23
00:01:17.551 --> 00:01:20.940
<v Speaker 1>I don't really speak much Korean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so with my pronunciation is terrible.</v>

24
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.250
<v Speaker 1>Koreans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>please forgive me in English,</v>

25
00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.560
<v Speaker 1>I am a student in Korean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>None.</v>

26
00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:29.340
<v Speaker 1>Then huck saying either in Japanese,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what Tashi duck say this.</v>

27
00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:33.750
<v Speaker 1>You can see that these sentences are </v>
<v Speaker 1>translatable word by word that each word</v>

28
00:01:33.751 --> 00:01:37.530
<v Speaker 1>in the first sentence has an equivalent </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the second sentence in the exact same</v>

29
00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.080
<v Speaker 1>position,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so if they are directly translatable.</v>

30
00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.620
<v Speaker 1>One thing I want to point out is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>topic marker.</v>

31
00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.290
<v Speaker 1>That's the second word.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In each of these sentences,</v>

32
00:01:46.291 --> 00:01:47.130
<v Speaker 1>that topic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Margaret,</v>

33
00:01:47.131 --> 00:01:50.100
<v Speaker 1>is something that's kind of unique to </v>
<v Speaker 1>Japanese and Korean topic.</v>

34
00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:50.933
<v Speaker 1>Marker points out the topics of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>sentence that's different from the </v>

35
00:01:53.431 --> 00:01:54.264
<v Speaker 1>grammatical subject,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the overarching focus or topic of the </v>

36
00:01:56.791 --> 00:01:59.040
<v Speaker 1>sentence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Another thing I want to point out is the</v>

37
00:01:59.041 --> 00:02:00.240
<v Speaker 1>last word.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In each sentence.</v>

38
00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:03.500
<v Speaker 1>In Korean it's EDA and in Japanese it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>destitute.</v>

39
00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:08.280
<v Speaker 1>In both cases that's like a popular,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the word is in English,</v>

40
00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:11.940
<v Speaker 1>so in both Japanese and Korean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a standalone word that is placed</v>

41
00:02:11.941 --> 00:02:16.941
<v Speaker 1>usually at the end of the sentence in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Korean and undone in Japanese.</v>

42
00:02:21.061 --> 00:02:22.800
<v Speaker 1>What does you up and easily will know me</v>
<v Speaker 1>much,</v>

43
00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:23.903
<v Speaker 1>so again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we see that the topics marker is the </v>

44
00:02:25.501 --> 00:02:26.334
<v Speaker 1>second word in each sentence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a more important thing that I want </v>

45
00:02:28.351 --> 00:02:32.340
<v Speaker 1>to point out here is the Sov word order.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That means subject,</v>

46
00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:33.450
<v Speaker 1>object,</v>
<v Speaker 1>verb,</v>

47
00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:37.710
<v Speaker 1>so we can see that the subject is what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Touchy or it's not in Korean,</v>

48
00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:41.580
<v Speaker 1>and then we have the object next to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>object is water.</v>

49
00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:42.623
<v Speaker 1>In Korean it's and in Japanese it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>music and then we have the verb at the </v>

50
00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:47.783
<v Speaker 1>end.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in Korean law seemed that Indian </v>

51
00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:51.113
<v Speaker 1>Japanese nomi must,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but before the verb there is an </v>

52
00:02:53.791 --> 00:02:54.624
<v Speaker 1>interesting little word that we don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>have an English and that is an object </v>

53
00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:58.253
<v Speaker 1>marker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's another thing that we find in </v>

54
00:03:00.491 --> 00:03:01.324
<v Speaker 1>both Japanese and Korean used in exactly</v>
<v Speaker 1>the same way in exactly the same </v>

55
00:03:04.541 --> 00:03:05.374
<v Speaker 1>position in the census,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though the grammar and sentence </v>

56
00:03:07.601 --> 00:03:10.210
<v Speaker 1>structure of the two languages is </v>
<v Speaker 1>remarkably similar,</v>

57
00:03:10.211 --> 00:03:11.044
<v Speaker 1>the vocabulary is remarkably different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If a Japanese speaker heard Korean </v>

58
00:03:14.411 --> 00:03:18.040
<v Speaker 1>without any prior exposure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they probably wouldn't understand any of</v>

59
00:03:18.041 --> 00:03:20.680
<v Speaker 1>the words at all or maybe just a word </v>
<v Speaker 1>here and there,</v>

60
00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:23.290
<v Speaker 1>but that doesn't mean that those words </v>
<v Speaker 1>aren't related.</v>

61
00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:28.270
<v Speaker 1>Korean and Japanese both inherited a </v>
<v Speaker 1>large number of loan words from Chinese.</v>

62
00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:32.410
<v Speaker 1>Approximately 60 percent of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>vocabulary in either language comes from</v>

63
00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:33.273
<v Speaker 1>Chinese.</v>

64
00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:35.990
<v Speaker 1>If there are so many Chinese loan words </v>
<v Speaker 1>in both languages,</v>

65
00:03:35.991 --> 00:03:38.230
<v Speaker 1>then why are they not mutually </v>
<v Speaker 1>comprehensible?</v>

66
00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:39.423
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's important to note that for both </v>

67
00:03:40.151 --> 00:03:43.720
<v Speaker 1>languages in daily conversation and </v>
<v Speaker 1>informal speech,</v>

68
00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:47.530
<v Speaker 1>that Chinese loan words are not used </v>
<v Speaker 1>nearly as much as they are in writing.</v>

69
00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:48.993
<v Speaker 1>Also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Chinese loan words are different in </v>

70
00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:54.100
<v Speaker 1>either language to enter the languages </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the form of Chinese characters,</v>

71
00:03:54.101 --> 00:03:54.934
<v Speaker 1>but the pronunciation of those </v>
<v Speaker 1>characters became adapted to fit the </v>

72
00:03:57.761 --> 00:04:02.080
<v Speaker 1>phonological system of either language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's look at some examples.</v>

73
00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:05.740
<v Speaker 1>The first example is just the name of </v>
<v Speaker 1>those Chinese characters themselves.</v>

74
00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:08.350
<v Speaker 1>In Chinese,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Korean,</v>

75
00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:09.423
<v Speaker 1>I'm job in Japanese Kanji so you can see</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the pronunciation started as an </v>

76
00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:15.233
<v Speaker 1>answer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it diverged and became different in </v>

77
00:04:17.771 --> 00:04:18.604
<v Speaker 1>Korean and Japanese even though it's the</v>
<v Speaker 1>same two characters at some other </v>

78
00:04:21.911 --> 00:04:22.744
<v Speaker 1>examples in Korean sap team in Japanese,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shashi and photograph the were forcing </v>

79
00:04:27.391 --> 00:04:28.840
<v Speaker 1>her in Korean.</v>

80
00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:34.480
<v Speaker 1>In Japanese costumes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The word for promise in Korean.</v>

81
00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:36.760
<v Speaker 1>Yuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sold in Japanese.</v>

82
00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:37.713
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because so cute.</v>

83
00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:38.673
<v Speaker 1>Those examples sound quite similar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but sometimes they sound really quite </v>

84
00:04:41.321 --> 00:04:43.570
<v Speaker 1>different,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if we look at the romanized world,</v>

85
00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:48.190
<v Speaker 1>sometimes we can see the similarities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the word for telephone in Korean</v>

86
00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:49.503
<v Speaker 1>children.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

87
00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:51.180
<v Speaker 1>In Japanese then?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

88
00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:54.100
<v Speaker 1>so those come from the same characters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but again,</v>

89
00:04:54.101 --> 00:04:56.230
<v Speaker 1>they're rendered differently in </v>
<v Speaker 1>pronunciation.</v>

90
00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:01.760
<v Speaker 1>The next word is school in Korean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How you'll in Japanese got cold.</v>

91
00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:03.643
<v Speaker 1>Another example is university in Korean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Japanese got Tofu in Korean to boot </v>

92
00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:12.483
<v Speaker 1>in Japanese soul food.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The word for SPA or hot spring in </v>

93
00:05:15.461 --> 00:05:16.690
<v Speaker 1>Korean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On John,</v>

94
00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:17.853
<v Speaker 1>in Japanese on sand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you can see that sometimes the words </v>

95
00:05:20.651 --> 00:05:21.484
<v Speaker 1>are clearly related,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when you're listening to the </v>

96
00:05:23.051 --> 00:05:23.884
<v Speaker 1>language being spoken,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you probably wouldn't be able to catch </v>

97
00:05:25.931 --> 00:05:28.330
<v Speaker 1>those words.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chinese loan words aside.</v>

98
00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:31.840
<v Speaker 1>There are also some Japanese loan words </v>
<v Speaker 1>that have entered the Korean language.</v>

99
00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:33.033
<v Speaker 1>The word for cheers when you're having a</v>
<v Speaker 1>drink and Korean going pay in Japanese </v>

100
00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:41.530
<v Speaker 1>come by.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Japanese word for bag in Korean it's</v>

101
00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:44.180
<v Speaker 1>in Japanese.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's come on.</v>

102
00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:45.243
<v Speaker 1>There are also a lot of words that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>native to both Korean and Japanese that </v>

103
00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:51.640
<v Speaker 1>might be related to each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The word for island in Korean,</v>

104
00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:56.170
<v Speaker 1>in Japanese Shima the word for village </v>
<v Speaker 1>in Korean.</v>

105
00:05:57.170 --> 00:05:58.520
<v Speaker 1>In Japanese,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Buddha.</v>

106
00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:01.970
<v Speaker 1>There are a lot of words like that that </v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't really think are connected,</v>

107
00:06:01.971 --> 00:06:05.390
<v Speaker 1>but linguists think might be connected.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Interestingly though,</v>

108
00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:06.253
<v Speaker 1>some of the grammatical particles have </v>
<v Speaker 1>very similar pronunciations in the two </v>

109
00:06:09.201 --> 00:06:10.550
<v Speaker 1>languages.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

110
00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:11.413
<v Speaker 1>the word for above.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In Korean we ate in Japanese who a </v>

111
00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:18.680
<v Speaker 1>question particle co in Korean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the double continent,</v>

112
00:06:18.681 --> 00:06:22.250
<v Speaker 1>the Double Cup in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In Japanese it's cut the word for two or</v>

113
00:06:22.251 --> 00:06:22.880
<v Speaker 1>towards.</v>

114
00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:26.900
<v Speaker 1>In Korean it's a and in Japanese it's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>the subject marker,</v>

115
00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:28.690
<v Speaker 1>so this is different from the topic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Margaret,</v>

116
00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:33.470
<v Speaker 1>the subject marker is in Korean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>got for eat in Japanese,</v>

117
00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:34.333
<v Speaker 1>it's just got so basically Korean and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Japanese have a lot of vocabulary that </v>

118
00:06:38.121 --> 00:06:38.954
<v Speaker 1>are related but not the same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's probably enough to help you </v>

119
00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:42.553
<v Speaker 1>remember that word if you study it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not necessarily enough to pick up </v>

120
00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:48.680
<v Speaker 1>that word when you're hearing it in </v>
<v Speaker 1>conversation,</v>

121
00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:49.663
<v Speaker 1>and of course most of the spoken </v>
<v Speaker 1>vocabulary seems to be unrelated or </v>

122
00:06:52.521 --> 00:06:55.640
<v Speaker 1>they're words that have very ancient </v>
<v Speaker 1>connections to each other.</v>

123
00:06:55.850 --> 00:06:59.000
<v Speaker 1>Now let's look at the different </v>
<v Speaker 1>pronunciation of the two languages.</v>

124
00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:00.073
<v Speaker 1>In some ways they're similar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The basic phonetic sounds of the two </v>

125
00:07:02.241 --> 00:07:03.074
<v Speaker 1>languages are quite similar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the way those phonetic sounds are </v>

126
00:07:05.571 --> 00:07:08.690
<v Speaker 1>arranged to create syllables is </v>
<v Speaker 1>different in the two languages.</v>

127
00:07:09.230 --> 00:07:12.440
<v Speaker 1>In Japanese,</v>
<v Speaker 1>basically every syllable has to end in a</v>

128
00:07:12.441 --> 00:07:12.830
<v Speaker 1>vowel.</v>

129
00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:15.980
<v Speaker 1>You cannot have a word that ends in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>solid consonant like cut.</v>

130
00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:19.640
<v Speaker 1>It has to be something like customer </v>
<v Speaker 1>with a vowel added to the end,</v>

131
00:07:19.910 --> 00:07:23.330
<v Speaker 1>but in Korean you can have a consonant </v>
<v Speaker 1>at the end of a syllable.</v>

132
00:07:23.570 --> 00:07:27.200
<v Speaker 1>That's why in one of the words that we </v>
<v Speaker 1>compared before the word promise,</v>

133
00:07:27.470 --> 00:07:29.140
<v Speaker 1>in Japanese,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's yet grew so poor.</v>

134
00:07:29.210 --> 00:07:31.130
<v Speaker 1>You need those vowels after the </v>
<v Speaker 1>continence,</v>

135
00:07:31.190 --> 00:07:32.023
<v Speaker 1>but in Korea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's yet another difference is that </v>

136
00:07:34.551 --> 00:07:35.384
<v Speaker 1>in Japanese,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the pronunciation of consonants doesn't </v>

137
00:07:37.311 --> 00:07:39.620
<v Speaker 1>change depending on their position in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the word,</v>

138
00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:40.513
<v Speaker 1>they just are always the same,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in Korean there are consonants and </v>

139
00:07:43.011 --> 00:07:43.844
<v Speaker 1>that can change depending on whether </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're at the beginning of the word in </v>

140
00:07:46.371 --> 00:07:48.600
<v Speaker 1>the middle of the word or at the end of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the word.</v>

141
00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:52.670
<v Speaker 1>Korean also has a greater variety of </v>
<v Speaker 1>vowels and diphthongs,</v>

142
00:07:52.940 --> 00:07:53.773
<v Speaker 1>so in general,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Korean pronunciation is just more </v>

143
00:07:55.640 --> 00:07:56.473
<v Speaker 1>complex than Japanese pronunciation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One thing that is completely different </v>

144
00:07:59.811 --> 00:08:02.270
<v Speaker 1>between the two languages is there </v>
<v Speaker 1>writing systems.</v>

145
00:08:02.510 --> 00:08:07.510
<v Speaker 1>Japanese is written using a combination </v>
<v Speaker 1>of Chinese characters and two syllables.</v>

146
00:08:07.980 --> 00:08:08.813
<v Speaker 1>Those is consist of characters that </v>
<v Speaker 1>represent entire syllables rather than </v>

147
00:08:12.351 --> 00:08:13.184
<v Speaker 1>just individual phonetic sounds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Japanese writing system is quite </v>

148
00:08:16.221 --> 00:08:17.054
<v Speaker 1>complex and since you need to learn more</v>
<v Speaker 1>than 2000 congee to be able to read at </v>

149
00:08:20.481 --> 00:08:21.314
<v Speaker 1>an adult level,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it can take quite a lot of time and </v>

150
00:08:22.971 --> 00:08:24.410
<v Speaker 1>effort to learn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Korean,</v>

151
00:08:24.411 --> 00:08:26.870
<v Speaker 1>on the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is written in the humble alphabet,</v>

152
00:08:26.900 --> 00:08:29.810
<v Speaker 1>which is one of the simplest writing </v>
<v Speaker 1>systems in the world.</v>

153
00:08:29.930 --> 00:08:33.620
<v Speaker 1>Korean used to use Han Chinese </v>
<v Speaker 1>characters in the same way that Japanese</v>

154
00:08:33.621 --> 00:08:36.930
<v Speaker 1>uses congee and combination with Ido </v>
<v Speaker 1>gonna Kinda Kinda.</v>

155
00:08:37.310 --> 00:08:38.143
<v Speaker 1>But they've done away with that and now </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're just using the simplified </v>

156
00:08:39.861 --> 00:08:41.900
<v Speaker 1>writing system of humble,</v>
<v Speaker 1>humble.</v>

157
00:08:41.901 --> 00:08:42.734
<v Speaker 1>Alphabet consists of individual phonetic</v>
<v Speaker 1>symbols that are arranged together to </v>

158
00:08:46.011 --> 00:08:49.110
<v Speaker 1>create syllables.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In this example for hunch,</v>

159
00:08:49.580 --> 00:08:51.830
<v Speaker 1>this is the sound for like an h.</v>

160
00:08:51.980 --> 00:08:55.320
<v Speaker 1>This is the sound.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the sound for like an end.</v>

161
00:08:55.470 --> 00:08:58.620
<v Speaker 1>This is the sound for a job for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is ah,</v>

162
00:08:58.930 --> 00:08:59.763
<v Speaker 1>so whereas Japanese requires you to </v>
<v Speaker 1>learn 92 syllabary symbols and 2000 </v>

163
00:09:03.900 --> 00:09:04.733
<v Speaker 1>congee in Korea and you just have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>learn 24 phonetic symbols and you can </v>

164
00:09:08.581 --> 00:09:11.130
<v Speaker 1>use those to represent any new words </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you learned.</v>

165
00:09:11.730 --> 00:09:12.563
<v Speaker 1>So to summarize,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Korean and Japanese are very similar in </v>

166
00:09:15.031 --> 00:09:15.864
<v Speaker 1>terms of sentence structure and grammar </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they both have a large number of </v>

167
00:09:18.691 --> 00:09:19.524
<v Speaker 1>Chinese loan words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the native vocabularies are quite </v>

168
00:09:22.021 --> 00:09:22.854
<v Speaker 1>different as is the pronunciation which </v>
<v Speaker 1>makes these two languages mutually </v>

169
00:09:26.250 --> 00:09:28.260
<v Speaker 1>unintelligible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On top of that,</v>

170
00:09:28.290 --> 00:09:31.620
<v Speaker 1>the two writing systems are now </v>
<v Speaker 1>completely different with the new modern</v>

171
00:09:31.710 --> 00:09:32.543
<v Speaker 1>Korean system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>completely avoiding Chinese characters </v>

172
00:09:34.591 --> 00:09:35.424
<v Speaker 1>these days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My feeling is that Japanese and Korean </v>

173
00:09:37.740 --> 00:09:41.070
<v Speaker 1>did originate from the same language a </v>
<v Speaker 1>very long time ago,</v>

174
00:09:41.071 --> 00:09:43.290
<v Speaker 1>but they've been diverging for a long </v>
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>

175
00:09:43.291 --> 00:09:44.124
<v Speaker 1>perhaps about 2000 years so that now </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're very different even though </v>

176
00:09:46.741 --> 00:09:47.574
<v Speaker 1>structurally they're quite similar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank you for watching the Lang focus </v>

<v Speaker 1>or Korean and you can let us know about </v>

179
00:09:56.041 --> 00:09:59.130
<v Speaker 1>some other similarities or differences </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you have discovered.</v>
