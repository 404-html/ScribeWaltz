<v Speaker 1>Follow lane focus on facebook,</v>
<v Speaker 1>twitter,</v>

2
00:00:02.041 --> 00:00:02.910
<v Speaker 1>and instagram.</v>

3
00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:04.540
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

4
00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:05.373
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the most commonly spoken romance </v>

5
00:00:06.491 --> 00:00:09.730
<v Speaker 1>languages are of Spanish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Portuguese,</v>

6
00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:11.230
<v Speaker 1>French,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Italian.</v>

7
00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:12.490
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was one more,</v>

8
00:00:12.491 --> 00:00:14.650
<v Speaker 1>what was it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh Micky.</v>

9
00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:15.850
<v Speaker 1>Stop that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are you doing?</v>

10
00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:17.673
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>

11
00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:21.310
<v Speaker 1>so the romance language just came from </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Roman Empire,</v>

12
00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:23.200
<v Speaker 1>the languages of Rome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

13
00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:25.450
<v Speaker 1>what was it again?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

14
00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:29.140
<v Speaker 1>Mickey.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mickey,</v>

15
00:00:29.141 --> 00:00:30.340
<v Speaker 1>what are you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Give me that.</v>

16
00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:33.850
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>

17
00:00:33.851 --> 00:00:38.851
<v Speaker 1>so what was it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hello everyone.</v>

18
00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.530
<v Speaker 1>Welcome to the Lange Focus Channel and </v>
<v Speaker 1>my name is Paul.</v>

19
00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.590
<v Speaker 1>Today's topic is the Romanian language </v>
<v Speaker 1>or lean borrow mueller in Romanian.</v>

20
00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.190
<v Speaker 1>As you can see the word Romanian </v>
<v Speaker 1>contains the word Roman in it.</v>

21
00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:54.143
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because it developed from the language </v>

22
00:00:55.381 --> 00:00:56.214
<v Speaker 1>of the Romans Latin to clarify Romanian </v>
<v Speaker 1>as a member of the romance language </v>

23
00:01:00.121 --> 00:01:02.370
<v Speaker 1>family.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When speaking of romance languages,</v>

24
00:01:02.371 --> 00:01:05.760
<v Speaker 1>Romanian tends to get overlooked and I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>guilty of that myself.</v>

25
00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:06.743
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's because of its geographic </v>
<v Speaker 1>isolation from the other romance </v>

26
00:01:09.361 --> 00:01:10.170
<v Speaker 1>languages.</v>

27
00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.003
<v Speaker 1>You can see that the other major romance</v>
<v Speaker 1>languages are all spoken in western </v>

28
00:01:13.681 --> 00:01:14.514
<v Speaker 1>Europe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but Romanian has spoken in eastern </v>

29
00:01:15.841 --> 00:01:16.674
<v Speaker 1>Europe and to separate it from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>others by the Belkins and parts of </v>

30
00:01:18.901 --> 00:01:19.734
<v Speaker 1>central Europe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Romania and as part of the Eastern </v>

31
00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:23.873
<v Speaker 1>Romance Branch and there are other </v>
<v Speaker 1>languages of this branch which are </v>

32
00:01:25.141 --> 00:01:27.690
<v Speaker 1>spoken by minorities throughout </v>
<v Speaker 1>southeastern Europe.</v>

33
00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.140
<v Speaker 1>Notice that the names of these languages</v>
<v Speaker 1>contain the word Romanian.</v>

34
00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:33.900
<v Speaker 1>These languages are all closely related </v>
<v Speaker 1>to Romania.</v>

35
00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.033
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes the word Romania is used to </v>
<v Speaker 1>refer to all of these closely related </v>

36
00:01:38.191 --> 00:01:39.024
<v Speaker 1>languages together and some eastern </v>
<v Speaker 1>romance speakers consider them to be </v>

37
00:01:41.791 --> 00:01:42.624
<v Speaker 1>dialects of one language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The language of Romania and Moldova is </v>

38
00:01:45.571 --> 00:01:46.404
<v Speaker 1>sometimes referred to as Dayco Romania </v>
<v Speaker 1>to distinguish between it and the </v>

39
00:01:49.201 --> 00:01:51.480
<v Speaker 1>others.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dayco Romanian has the largest number of</v>

40
00:01:51.481 --> 00:01:52.314
<v Speaker 1>speakers out of all of those languages </v>
<v Speaker 1>by far and at this video I'm basically </v>

41
00:01:55.291 --> 00:01:56.880
<v Speaker 1>focusing on Dayco Romanian.</v>

42
00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:57.923
<v Speaker 1>Romanian is spoken by a route 24 million</v>
<v Speaker 1>native speakers and around 4000002nd </v>

43
00:02:02.131 --> 00:02:02.964
<v Speaker 1>language speakers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is the official language of Romania </v>

44
00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:09.750
<v Speaker 1>where it is the mother tongue of around </v>
<v Speaker 1>93% of the people or around 18.6</v>

45
00:02:09.751 --> 00:02:12.810
<v Speaker 1>million people as well as the official </v>
<v Speaker 1>language of Moldova.</v>

46
00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:17.400
<v Speaker 1>We're at spoken by around 2.7</v>
<v Speaker 1>5 million people in Moldova.</v>

47
00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:18.263
<v Speaker 1>The language is referred to as muddle </v>
<v Speaker 1>van by some people and as Romanian by </v>

48
00:02:21.601 --> 00:02:22.434
<v Speaker 1>others.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Romanian is somewhat unique amongst the </v>

49
00:02:24.121 --> 00:02:28.230
<v Speaker 1>romance languages because it developed </v>
<v Speaker 1>in close contact with other languages,</v>

50
00:02:28.231 --> 00:02:29.064
<v Speaker 1>mainly the Slavic languages which have </v>
<v Speaker 1>influenced its pronunciation and </v>

51
00:02:31.891 --> 00:02:34.860
<v Speaker 1>vocabulary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The closest romance language to Romanian</v>

52
00:02:34.861 --> 00:02:35.694
<v Speaker 1>is reportedly Italian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which shares about 77% lexical </v>

53
00:02:38.881 --> 00:02:39.714
<v Speaker 1>similarity with Romanian.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Compare that to 82% for Italian and </v>

54
00:02:42.961 --> 00:02:47.130
<v Speaker 1>Spanish or 89% for Italian and French </v>
<v Speaker 1>history.</v>

55
00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:48.263
<v Speaker 1>The people living in the area before the</v>
<v Speaker 1>arrival of the Romans were known as the </v>

56
00:02:51.311 --> 00:02:54.770
<v Speaker 1>dations or Dutchy and Romanian day.</v>

57
00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:55.603
<v Speaker 1>Shell was conquered by the Roman </v>
<v Speaker 1>military in one oh six ce and the </v>

58
00:02:58.321 --> 00:03:00.970
<v Speaker 1>population adopted the Latin language </v>
<v Speaker 1>very quickly.</v>

59
00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:02.193
<v Speaker 1>Exactly what happened is not clear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe the nation people simply adopted </v>

60
00:03:05.441 --> 00:03:09.400
<v Speaker 1>the Latin language of their conquerors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's also possible that the area was</v>

61
00:03:09.401 --> 00:03:13.060
<v Speaker 1>flooded with Roman settlers who </v>
<v Speaker 1>intermarried with the local stations.</v>

62
00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:14.013
<v Speaker 1>There's also the theory that the nation </v>
<v Speaker 1>language was already an Italian </v>

63
00:03:16.391 --> 00:03:18.220
<v Speaker 1>language,</v>
<v Speaker 1>closely related to Latin.</v>

64
00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:21.010
<v Speaker 1>What is clear is that the area became </v>
<v Speaker 1>very latinized.</v>

65
00:03:21.011 --> 00:03:21.844
<v Speaker 1>Very quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Roman Empire withdrew its military </v>

66
00:03:23.831 --> 00:03:24.664
<v Speaker 1>from Daysha and two 71 to two 72 ce,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but left behind a romanized Latin </v>

67
00:03:29.201 --> 00:03:30.034
<v Speaker 1>speaking population.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The next few centuries are fairly </v>

68
00:03:31.961 --> 00:03:32.794
<v Speaker 1>mysterious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the local dialects of Latin </v>

69
00:03:34.121 --> 00:03:38.230
<v Speaker 1>gradually evolved and sometime before </v>
<v Speaker 1>the ninth century Prodo Romanian,</v>

70
00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:41.320
<v Speaker 1>the ancestor of Romanian and all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>eastern Romance Languages,</v>

71
00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:42.183
<v Speaker 1>Oh rose,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are different opinions about </v>

72
00:03:43.511 --> 00:03:47.630
<v Speaker 1>whether protal Romanian developed from </v>
<v Speaker 1>the vulgar Latin spoken by the romanized</v>

73
00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:48.483
<v Speaker 1>station population or from a variety of </v>
<v Speaker 1>vulgar Latin spoken by people south of </v>

74
00:03:52.061 --> 00:03:52.894
<v Speaker 1>the Danube river,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who later migrated to the North Slavic </v>

75
00:03:55.391 --> 00:03:56.224
<v Speaker 1>influence.</v>

76
00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:00.580
<v Speaker 1>Notice again that Romanian is surrounded</v>
<v Speaker 1>by mostly Slavic languages.</v>

77
00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:03.760
<v Speaker 1>That's because of the migration of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Slavic speakers into the area.</v>

78
00:04:03.761 --> 00:04:04.594
<v Speaker 1>Between the seventh and ninth century CE</v>
<v Speaker 1>contact with Slavic speakers had an </v>

79
00:04:07.991 --> 00:04:08.824
<v Speaker 1>influence on eastern romance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>particularly in vocabulary and </v>

80
00:04:11.201 --> 00:04:13.810
<v Speaker 1>pronunciation but also in grammar and </v>
<v Speaker 1>other areas.</v>

81
00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:17.710
<v Speaker 1>It's fucked that many Slavic speakers </v>
<v Speaker 1>adopted the local romance dialect,</v>

82
00:04:17.711 --> 00:04:18.544
<v Speaker 1>but because it was their second language</v>
<v Speaker 1>they spoke it with an accent and they </v>

83
00:04:21.221 --> 00:04:22.054
<v Speaker 1>continue to use certain Slavic words </v>
<v Speaker 1>that felt natural for them to keep </v>

84
00:04:24.731 --> 00:04:25.870
<v Speaker 1>using.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Old Church.</v>

85
00:04:25.871 --> 00:04:26.704
<v Speaker 1>Slavonic must have also had an influence</v>
<v Speaker 1>on Romanian because it was the </v>

86
00:04:29.261 --> 00:04:30.094
<v Speaker 1>administrative language until the 16th </v>
<v Speaker 1>century and the liturgical language </v>

87
00:04:33.221 --> 00:04:34.054
<v Speaker 1>until the 17th century.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to know exactly how Romanian </v>

88
00:04:36.881 --> 00:04:37.714
<v Speaker 1>developed during the Middle Ages because</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are no existing Romanian texts </v>

89
00:04:40.811 --> 00:04:44.950
<v Speaker 1>from before the 16th century.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The earliest Romanian text is niac shoes</v>

90
00:04:44.951 --> 00:04:45.784
<v Speaker 1>letter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which dates to 1521 it was written with </v>

91
00:04:48.341 --> 00:04:52.210
<v Speaker 1>the Cyrillic alphabet which was used to </v>
<v Speaker 1>write Romanian until the 19th century.</v>

92
00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:55.240
<v Speaker 1>This is an obvious result of the Slavic </v>
<v Speaker 1>influence on the language,</v>

93
00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:57.153
<v Speaker 1>the modern period.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's beyond the scope of this video to </v>

94
00:04:59.111 --> 00:04:59.944
<v Speaker 1>go into detail about the history of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Romania and the governments that ruled </v>

95
00:05:02.741 --> 00:05:03.574
<v Speaker 1>over its different parts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's important for us to remember is </v>

96
00:05:05.591 --> 00:05:07.660
<v Speaker 1>that despite changing borders and </v>
<v Speaker 1>governments,</v>

97
00:05:07.661 --> 00:05:08.494
<v Speaker 1>there remained an ethnic and linguistic </v>
<v Speaker 1>group that considered themselves </v>

98
00:05:10.811 --> 00:05:11.644
<v Speaker 1>Romanian with a growing sense of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Romanian national identity efforts to </v>

99
00:05:15.041 --> 00:05:18.220
<v Speaker 1>standardize the Romanian language began </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the 18th century.</v>

100
00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:19.503
<v Speaker 1>The first Romanian grammar was published</v>
<v Speaker 1>in 1780 in the 18 hundreds Romanian </v>

101
00:05:24.161 --> 00:05:24.994
<v Speaker 1>linguists made a concerted effort to </v>
<v Speaker 1>read Latin guys the language and remove </v>

102
00:05:28.101 --> 00:05:30.640
<v Speaker 1>Slavic and other influences from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>language.</v>

103
00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:34.180
<v Speaker 1>And interestingly in replacing a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the non romance vocabulary,</v>

104
00:05:34.181 --> 00:05:35.014
<v Speaker 1>they drew words not only from Latin but </v>
<v Speaker 1>also from Italian that especially from </v>

105
00:05:38.021 --> 00:05:38.854
<v Speaker 1>French,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when Romania became an independent </v>

106
00:05:42.731 --> 00:05:46.450
<v Speaker 1>country in 1878 it's official language </v>
<v Speaker 1>became Romanian.</v>

107
00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:49.810
<v Speaker 1>It's borders changed several times </v>
<v Speaker 1>during the 20th century,</v>

108
00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:50.883
<v Speaker 1>while Moldova spent much of the 20th </v>
<v Speaker 1>century under Soviet rule as it gained </v>

109
00:05:54.581 --> 00:05:57.950
<v Speaker 1>independence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Moldova made Moldova in it's language.</v>

110
00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:02.210
<v Speaker 1>The consensus is that Romanian and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Moldovan are a single language just with</v>

111
00:06:02.211 --> 00:06:05.810
<v Speaker 1>some regional variation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The standard written language is exactly</v>

112
00:06:05.811 --> 00:06:10.640
<v Speaker 1>the same for both Romanian and Moldovan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So how did this romance language survive</v>

113
00:06:10.641 --> 00:06:13.220
<v Speaker 1>in this area when most others didn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>survive?</v>

114
00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:14.810
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nobody really knows.</v>

115
00:06:14.811 --> 00:06:15.644
<v Speaker 1>But as I said before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the area known as Daysha became </v>

116
00:06:17.511 --> 00:06:20.900
<v Speaker 1>thoroughly latinized probably more than </v>
<v Speaker 1>other areas in the region.</v>

117
00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:21.913
<v Speaker 1>So whereas in other areas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Latin influence faded after the </v>

118
00:06:24.141 --> 00:06:28.130
<v Speaker 1>departure of the Roman empire in Daysha </v>
<v Speaker 1>that Latin influenced did not fade.</v>

119
00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:29.323
<v Speaker 1>There are also various theories about </v>
<v Speaker 1>the people fending off invaders better </v>

120
00:06:32.391 --> 00:06:33.224
<v Speaker 1>than others or that the geography of </v>
<v Speaker 1>their land insulated them from being </v>

121
00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:37.490
<v Speaker 1>overrun that assimilated.</v>

122
00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:38.743
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some say that the Carpathian mountains </v>

123
00:06:40.461 --> 00:06:41.294
<v Speaker 1>provided a barrier for attack from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>north and east or provided refuge and </v>

124
00:06:44.721 --> 00:06:47.330
<v Speaker 1>strategic high ground above invaders.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But again,</v>

125
00:06:47.331 --> 00:06:50.270
<v Speaker 1>nobody really knows.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what is Romanian like?</v>

126
00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:51.223
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>since Romanian is a romance language </v>

127
00:06:52.431 --> 00:06:55.520
<v Speaker 1>that developed from Latin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's obviously quite similar to French,</v>

128
00:06:55.521 --> 00:06:56.400
<v Speaker 1>Spanish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Italian,</v>

129
00:06:56.401 --> 00:06:57.234
<v Speaker 1>and other romance languages,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's also been influenced by other </v>

130
00:06:59.631 --> 00:07:01.750
<v Speaker 1>languages,</v>
<v Speaker 1>particularly at the Slavic language,</v>

131
00:07:01.751 --> 00:07:04.390
<v Speaker 1>just because of its position in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Balkan [inaudible] wound.</v>

132
00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:05.443
<v Speaker 1>The balkins prop wound is an area in </v>
<v Speaker 1>which the various languages have </v>

133
00:07:08.361 --> 00:07:11.270
<v Speaker 1>mutually influenced each other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>including romance languages,</v>

134
00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:13.580
<v Speaker 1>Slavic languages,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Greek and Albanian.</v>

135
00:07:13.730 --> 00:07:16.160
<v Speaker 1>It has also been influenced by other </v>
<v Speaker 1>nearby languages,</v>

136
00:07:16.161 --> 00:07:16.994
<v Speaker 1>like Hungarian vocabulary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The majority of Romanian vocabulary is </v>

137
00:07:20.841 --> 00:07:23.900
<v Speaker 1>of Latin and romance origin based on one</v>
<v Speaker 1>study,</v>

138
00:07:23.901 --> 00:07:28.760
<v Speaker 1>63% of Romanian vocabulary is romance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>while 11.5%</v>

139
00:07:28.761 --> 00:07:31.580
<v Speaker 1>is slavic with other vocabulary coming </v>
<v Speaker 1>from Turkish,</v>

140
00:07:31.610 --> 00:07:32.660
<v Speaker 1>Greek,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hungarian,</v>

141
00:07:32.661 --> 00:07:36.080
<v Speaker 1>and German.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if we focus on the most common 2,500</v>

142
00:07:36.081 --> 00:07:36.914
<v Speaker 1>words in Romanian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the percentage of romance vocabulary is </v>

143
00:07:38.841 --> 00:07:43.841
<v Speaker 1>around 76% and slavic around 15% let's </v>
<v Speaker 1>look at some sentences and examine their</v>

144
00:07:44.871 --> 00:07:49.220
<v Speaker 1>vocabulary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] is [inaudible].</v>

145
00:07:49.460 --> 00:07:52.910
<v Speaker 1>This means I know the history of Europe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very well word for word,</v>

146
00:07:52.911 --> 00:07:56.870
<v Speaker 1>it's I know history,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Europe's very well.</v>

147
00:07:57.140 --> 00:07:57.973
<v Speaker 1>All of these words are romance words.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cornell risk means I know or I'm </v>

148
00:08:01.431 --> 00:08:06.431
<v Speaker 1>familiar with and it's like Conosco in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Italian or Juco ne in French you studier</v>

149
00:08:07.580 --> 00:08:11.480
<v Speaker 1>means history and it's like sturdier in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Italian or east La.</v>

150
00:08:11.540 --> 00:08:15.310
<v Speaker 1>In French it would ropey means European </v>
<v Speaker 1>and is like a,</v>

151
00:08:15.311 --> 00:08:20.311
<v Speaker 1>it will pale in Italian or google pay on</v>
<v Speaker 1>in French four out of the day means very</v>

152
00:08:20.990 --> 00:08:21.823
<v Speaker 1>in Romanian and is related to the word </v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning strong in Italian photo tay and </v>

153
00:08:25.461 --> 00:08:26.294
<v Speaker 1>in French fall.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So here it means very and it's not used </v>

154
00:08:28.551 --> 00:08:31.100
<v Speaker 1>that way in Italian or French being the </v>
<v Speaker 1>means,</v>

155
00:08:31.101 --> 00:08:31.934
<v Speaker 1>well like the Italian word Bennett and </v>
<v Speaker 1>like the French word beyond another </v>

156
00:08:35.691 --> 00:08:37.310
<v Speaker 1>example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm spoiled,</v>

157
00:08:37.311 --> 00:08:40.490
<v Speaker 1>Machina,</v>
<v Speaker 1>foot up probe limit and Fatah casy.</v>

158
00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:44.750
<v Speaker 1>This means I washed the car in front of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the house without any problems.</v>

159
00:08:44.870 --> 00:08:46.580
<v Speaker 1>Word for word,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's myself.</v>

160
00:08:46.670 --> 00:08:47.503
<v Speaker 1>I wash car,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the without problems in face houses the </v>

161
00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:56.153
<v Speaker 1>means me or myself like me in Italian or</v>
<v Speaker 1>in French it's the indirect object </v>

162
00:09:01.771 --> 00:09:02.604
<v Speaker 1>pronouns which is used here because the </v>
<v Speaker 1>verbus reflexive but means wash in the </v>

163
00:09:06.751 --> 00:09:07.584
<v Speaker 1>first person singular.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This word developed from vulgar Latin x </v>

164
00:09:10.081 --> 00:09:12.870
<v Speaker 1>bed Levada and it's like the Portuguese </v>
<v Speaker 1>word pedal.</v>

165
00:09:12.871 --> 00:09:13.704
<v Speaker 1>Nevada meaning to wash machina means car</v>
<v Speaker 1>and a similar to Makena in Italian and </v>

166
00:09:19.051 --> 00:09:22.650
<v Speaker 1>like Makina in Spanish which means </v>
<v Speaker 1>machine or engine.</v>

167
00:09:23.060 --> 00:09:23.893
<v Speaker 1>Flooded means without and comes from </v>
<v Speaker 1>Latin thought us like 40 in Italian </v>

168
00:09:28.020 --> 00:09:32.820
<v Speaker 1>which means outside put it all blemish </v>
<v Speaker 1>is also a romance word coming from Latin</v>

169
00:09:32.890 --> 00:09:35.490
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] which ultimately came from </v>
<v Speaker 1>ancient Greek.</v>

170
00:09:35.830 --> 00:09:36.663
<v Speaker 1>It means in and comes from Latin and </v>
<v Speaker 1>ultimately goes all the way back to </v>

171
00:09:39.841 --> 00:09:40.674
<v Speaker 1>Prodo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Indo European Fidessa I means face or </v>

172
00:09:42.871 --> 00:09:44.880
<v Speaker 1>front and comes from vulgar Latin.</v>

173
00:09:44.940 --> 00:09:48.480
<v Speaker 1>Fuck Ya.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's similar to fuck in Italian and fuss</v>

174
00:09:48.510 --> 00:09:49.343
<v Speaker 1>and French.</v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] means house like Kazaa in </v>

175
00:09:52.081 --> 00:09:52.914
<v Speaker 1>Italian and Casa in Spanish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Another example today with the or prima </v>

176
00:09:57.521 --> 00:10:01.170
<v Speaker 1>does boil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This means we must stop the war word for</v>

177
00:10:01.171 --> 00:10:02.004
<v Speaker 1>word.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's must subjunctive stop war that Abe </v>

178
00:10:05.270 --> 00:10:06.103
<v Speaker 1>we means have to and as a slavic lone </v>
<v Speaker 1>word comes from Latin C and at this </v>

179
00:10:11.421 --> 00:10:12.254
<v Speaker 1>sentence indicates the subjunctive mood </v>
<v Speaker 1>or putting means stop and as a Slavic </v>

180
00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:20.520
<v Speaker 1>Lone word that does bullying means war </v>
<v Speaker 1>and is also a slavic lone word.</v>

181
00:10:21.090 --> 00:10:23.880
<v Speaker 1>Many commonly used Romanian words are of</v>
<v Speaker 1>Slavic origin.</v>

182
00:10:24.150 --> 00:10:24.983
<v Speaker 1>A few more examples are but yet then </v>
<v Speaker 1>friend Iub to love Uplit d to Pay </v>

183
00:10:31.340 --> 00:10:34.800
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] to wake up a go to see to </v>
<v Speaker 1>find.</v>

184
00:10:35.430 --> 00:10:36.263
<v Speaker 1>So as you can see the majority of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Romanian vocabulary is romance </v>

185
00:10:38.791 --> 00:10:41.970
<v Speaker 1>vocabulary but Slavic vocabulary is also</v>
<v Speaker 1>quite evident.</v>

186
00:10:42.150 --> 00:10:42.983
<v Speaker 1>We'd order.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The word order of Romanian is very </v>

187
00:10:44.821 --> 00:10:45.654
<v Speaker 1>similar to other romance languages with </v>
<v Speaker 1>one particular difference that we'll </v>

188
00:10:48.241 --> 00:10:50.380
<v Speaker 1>notice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible]</v>

189
00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:53.200
<v Speaker 1>is [inaudible],</v>
<v Speaker 1>CONOSCO,</v>

190
00:10:53.210 --> 00:10:55.020
<v Speaker 1>Storia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] Molto Bene.</v>

191
00:10:55.290 --> 00:10:57.720
<v Speaker 1>The keywords in these sentences are all </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the same order.</v>

192
00:10:57.900 --> 00:10:58.733
<v Speaker 1>What's different is that the Romanian </v>
<v Speaker 1>sentence has no standalone definite </v>

193
00:11:01.411 --> 00:11:05.760
<v Speaker 1>article or preposition for of that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>because while other romance languages no</v>

194
00:11:05.761 --> 00:11:09.090
<v Speaker 1>longer have Cayston declensions for </v>
<v Speaker 1>nouns and adjectives like Latin did,</v>

195
00:11:09.210 --> 00:11:10.920
<v Speaker 1>Romanian does have them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

196
00:11:10.921 --> 00:11:14.680
<v Speaker 1>it has three case declensions for </v>
<v Speaker 1>announce languages that don't have case.</v>

197
00:11:14.681 --> 00:11:18.810
<v Speaker 1>Declensions often use prepositions </v>
<v Speaker 1>instead to indicate the same information</v>

198
00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:22.320
<v Speaker 1>in the sentence it [inaudible] is in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>genitive case,</v>

199
00:11:22.350 --> 00:11:23.183
<v Speaker 1>meaning of Europe or Europe's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The most basic form of the noun is </v>

200
00:11:25.921 --> 00:11:26.754
<v Speaker 1>actually [inaudible] with an a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the eye at the end is a definite </v>

201
00:11:29.731 --> 00:11:34.410
<v Speaker 1>article and the he indicates genitive </v>
<v Speaker 1>case because the genitive case indicates</v>

202
00:11:34.411 --> 00:11:35.244
<v Speaker 1>possession.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't need a preposition meaning of </v>

203
00:11:37.230 --> 00:11:41.060
<v Speaker 1>like an Italian.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As for the definite article in Romanian,</v>

204
00:11:41.070 --> 00:11:43.830
<v Speaker 1>it comes at the end of the word and </v>
<v Speaker 1>works together with the case.</v>

205
00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:48.390
<v Speaker 1>Declension in the word you sturdier the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Aa shows that the word is definite.</v>

206
00:11:48.420 --> 00:11:52.500
<v Speaker 1>So we don't need a definite article </v>
<v Speaker 1>before the word Noun cases.</v>

207
00:11:52.620 --> 00:11:53.453
<v Speaker 1>Let's look a noun in Romanian and see </v>
<v Speaker 1>how it changes form depending on its </v>

208
00:11:56.381 --> 00:11:58.510
<v Speaker 1>case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning it's role in the sentence.</v>

209
00:11:58.540 --> 00:11:59.373
<v Speaker 1>The Noun is but a but which means man </v>
<v Speaker 1>first in the singular indefinite </v>

210
00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:04.233
<v Speaker 1>nominative and accusative wound,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a buck genitive and dative Uber </v>

211
00:12:08.460 --> 00:12:10.620
<v Speaker 1>Bucks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Definite but a bottle,</v>

212
00:12:10.830 --> 00:12:14.710
<v Speaker 1>but a bottle and in the plural </v>
<v Speaker 1>indefinite initiative,</v>

213
00:12:14.711 --> 00:12:16.810
<v Speaker 1>but a butts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who Norbert Bucks?</v>

214
00:12:17.080 --> 00:12:18.690
<v Speaker 1>Definite.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But Betsy.</v>

215
00:12:18.910 --> 00:12:19.743
<v Speaker 1>But Betsy Lord,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here are a couple of examples of case </v>

216
00:12:22.991 --> 00:12:25.630
<v Speaker 1>declensions in context focusing on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>word,</v>

217
00:12:25.660 --> 00:12:26.493
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

218
00:12:27.010 --> 00:12:29.770
<v Speaker 1>but a bottle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all machinery.</v>

219
00:12:30.070 --> 00:12:35.070
<v Speaker 1>This sentence means the man bought a car</v>
<v Speaker 1>word for word Ed's man has bought a car.</v>

220
00:12:37.210 --> 00:12:41.650
<v Speaker 1>The form of the word for the man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but about tool is in the nominative case</v>

221
00:12:41.651 --> 00:12:42.850
<v Speaker 1>because it's the subject.</v>

222
00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:46.780
<v Speaker 1>So we use the definite declension for </v>
<v Speaker 1>nominative case that we saw before.</v>

223
00:12:47.950 --> 00:12:51.580
<v Speaker 1>Another example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Blanchet my Sheena [inaudible].</v>

224
00:12:51.730 --> 00:12:55.090
<v Speaker 1>This sentence means I like the man's car</v>
<v Speaker 1>word for word,</v>

225
00:12:55.091 --> 00:12:59.860
<v Speaker 1>it's myself or to me like car,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the man,</v>

226
00:12:59.861 --> 00:13:00.694
<v Speaker 1>the possessive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the form of the word for the man is in </v>

227
00:13:03.611 --> 00:13:05.830
<v Speaker 1>the genitive case because it's showing </v>
<v Speaker 1>possession.</v>

228
00:13:06.040 --> 00:13:06.873
<v Speaker 1>So we use the definite declension for </v>
<v Speaker 1>genitive data that we saw before the ul </v>

229
00:13:10.660 --> 00:13:11.493
<v Speaker 1>coming after the word,</v>

253
00:14:43.150 --> 00:14:47.410
<v Speaker 1>and put to it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean could or were able to message.</v>

<v Speaker 1>It means go and comes from the Latin </v>
<v Speaker 1>medidata meaning to dip or to plunge.</v>

255
00:14:52.970 --> 00:14:54.530
<v Speaker 1>But in Romania,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Romanian it means to go.</v>

256
00:14:55.010 --> 00:14:55.843
<v Speaker 1>La is a preposition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning to and comes from the Latin you </v>

00:14:58.431 --> 00:15:02.930
<v Speaker 1>luck and picnic means picnic and comes </v>
<v Speaker 1>from the French word picnic.</v>

258
00:15:03.830 --> 00:15:07.250
<v Speaker 1>If you speak a romance language or if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you've ever studied a romance language,</v>

259
00:15:07.280 --> 00:15:10.130
<v Speaker 1>then you'll probably notice a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>similarities with Romania,</v>

260
00:15:10.280 --> 00:15:13.190
<v Speaker 1>but you may have to look a little closer</v>
<v Speaker 1>to notice those similarities.</v>

261
00:15:13.250 --> 00:15:14.083
<v Speaker 1>Romanian clearly developed in a somewhat</v>
<v Speaker 1>different direction from other romance </v>

262
00:15:16.881 --> 00:15:19.430
<v Speaker 1>languages and even though it was re </v>
<v Speaker 1>latinized,</v>

263
00:15:19.431 --> 00:15:23.660
<v Speaker 1>it still feels more slavic in some ways </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the way words are articulated in the</v>

264
00:15:23.661 --> 00:15:26.270
<v Speaker 1>way words are formed and in some details</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the grammar.</v>

265
00:15:26.420 --> 00:15:27.253
<v Speaker 1>That's what makes Romanian interesting </v>
<v Speaker 1>and unique amongst the romance </v>

266
00:15:29.301 --> 00:15:31.970
<v Speaker 1>languages.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's development in geographic isolation</v>

267
00:15:31.971 --> 00:15:34.670
<v Speaker 1>from the others and it's contact with </v>
<v Speaker 1>neighboring languages.</v>

268
00:15:34.700 --> 00:15:37.670
<v Speaker 1>So the question of the day for speakers </v>
<v Speaker 1>of Romanian,</v>

269
00:15:37.671 --> 00:15:41.750
<v Speaker 1>how similar to you think Romanian is to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the other romance languages like Italian</v>

270
00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:44.000
<v Speaker 1>and for speakers of other romance </v>
<v Speaker 1>languages.</v>

271
00:15:44.030 --> 00:15:44.863
<v Speaker 1>How similar or different to you think </v>
<v Speaker 1>Romanian is from your language and what </v>

272
00:15:47.541 --> 00:15:49.760
<v Speaker 1>stands out to you as the biggest </v>
<v Speaker 1>difference?</v>
