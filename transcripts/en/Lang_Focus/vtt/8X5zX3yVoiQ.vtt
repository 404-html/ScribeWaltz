00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:06.233
<v Speaker 1>Hello everyone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>welcome to the channel and my name is </v>

2
00:00:08.821 --> 00:00:12.030
<v Speaker 1>Paul.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Today's topic is the Scots language.</v>

3
00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:14.670
<v Speaker 1>Scott's is a language spoken in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Scotland,</v>

4
00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.310
<v Speaker 1>one of the constituent countries of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>United Kingdom.</v>

5
00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:18.323
<v Speaker 1>Right off the bat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's important to point out that there </v>

6
00:00:19.651 --> 00:00:22.140
<v Speaker 1>are essentially three different </v>
<v Speaker 1>languages in Scotland,</v>

7
00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:23.220
<v Speaker 1>Scottish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>English,</v>

8
00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.630
<v Speaker 1>Scott's and garlic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Garlic is a Celtic language that is only</v>

9
00:00:27.631 --> 00:00:31.440
<v Speaker 1>distantly related to English and Scots </v>
<v Speaker 1>as an endo European language.</v>

10
00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:32.460
<v Speaker 1>Scott,</v>
<v Speaker 1>since Scottish,</v>

11
00:00:32.461 --> 00:00:35.460
<v Speaker 1>English on the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are closely related to each other,</v>

12
00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:36.443
<v Speaker 1>though they're not the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Scottish English is for the most part </v>

13
00:00:39.331 --> 00:00:41.910
<v Speaker 1>standard English,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but spoken with a Scottish accent.</v>

14
00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:42.893
<v Speaker 1>Scott's on the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is distinct having diverged from a </v>

15
00:00:45.301 --> 00:00:48.540
<v Speaker 1>dialect of middle English and having </v>
<v Speaker 1>features that differ from English.</v>

16
00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:49.463
<v Speaker 1>Some people consider Scott's to be a </v>
<v Speaker 1>separate language while others consider </v>

17
00:00:52.231 --> 00:00:54.390
<v Speaker 1>it to be a historical dialect of </v>
<v Speaker 1>English,</v>

18
00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.640
<v Speaker 1>just like the historical dialects found </v>
<v Speaker 1>in England,</v>

19
00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.470
<v Speaker 1>but we'll get into that a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 1>later.</v>

20
00:00:58.650 --> 00:00:59.483
<v Speaker 1>According to the 2011 Scottish census,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just over one point $5 million people </v>

21
00:01:03.211 --> 00:01:04.044
<v Speaker 1>speak.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Scott's around 30 percent of the </v>

22
00:01:05.341 --> 00:01:09.610
<v Speaker 1>Scottish population history.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The roots of Scott's lion,</v>

23
00:01:09.611 --> 00:01:13.150
<v Speaker 1>north Umbria and old English,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of several old English dialects,</v>

24
00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:14.483
<v Speaker 1>Northumbria and old English was being </v>
<v Speaker 1>spoken by the seventh century in the </v>

25
00:01:17.711 --> 00:01:18.544
<v Speaker 1>Anglo Saxon Kingdom of North Umbria,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was located in northeastern </v>

26
00:01:21.611 --> 00:01:23.590
<v Speaker 1>England,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and part of the Scottish lowlands.</v>

27
00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:26.980
<v Speaker 1>The Kingdom of Scotland was founded in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the year 8:43</v>

28
00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:30.280
<v Speaker 1>with the unification of the pig dish </v>
<v Speaker 1>people and golic speaking.</v>

29
00:01:30.281 --> 00:01:31.114
<v Speaker 1>Scott's but English speaking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Northumbria and lance were not yet part </v>

30
00:01:33.971 --> 00:01:34.804
<v Speaker 1>of the kingdom when the northern part of</v>
<v Speaker 1>North Umbria finally became part of </v>

31
00:01:38.501 --> 00:01:40.270
<v Speaker 1>Scotland.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In the 11th century,</v>

32
00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:42.970
<v Speaker 1>Golic became the prestige language of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the area,</v>

33
00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:46.000
<v Speaker 1>but English remained the most widely </v>
<v Speaker 1>spoken language.</v>

34
00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:47.733
<v Speaker 1>The variety of English spoken there may </v>
<v Speaker 1>have been significantly influenced by </v>

35
00:01:50.921 --> 00:01:53.500
<v Speaker 1>norse because the southern part of North</v>
<v Speaker 1>Umbria,</v>

36
00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:55.930
<v Speaker 1>along with much of northern and eastern </v>
<v Speaker 1>England,</v>

37
00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:58.570
<v Speaker 1>had been under Danish control and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>English.</v>

38
00:01:58.570 --> 00:01:59.403
<v Speaker 1>Dialects had been influenced by norse </v>
<v Speaker 1>and Scandinavian settlers were also </v>

39
00:02:02.891 --> 00:02:05.410
<v Speaker 1>present beyond the border of that area </v>
<v Speaker 1>as well.</v>

40
00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:09.040
<v Speaker 1>In the twelfth and 13th centuries during</v>
<v Speaker 1>the middle English period,</v>

41
00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:10.113
<v Speaker 1>the [inaudible] system of administrative</v>
<v Speaker 1>division led to the spread of English </v>

42
00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:16.900
<v Speaker 1>further into Scotland borrows.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're autonomous urban communities where</v>

43
00:02:16.901 --> 00:02:17.950
<v Speaker 1>traders,</v>
<v Speaker 1>merchants,</v>

44
00:02:17.951 --> 00:02:18.784
<v Speaker 1>and craftsmen could live and do business</v>
<v Speaker 1>in exchange for paying taxes on their </v>

45
00:02:21.851 --> 00:02:22.684
<v Speaker 1>earnings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The bureaus were ruled by nobles who </v>

46
00:02:24.311 --> 00:02:25.144
<v Speaker 1>answered to the King.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They attract an economic migrants from </v>

47
00:02:27.461 --> 00:02:28.294
<v Speaker 1>other parts of Scotland,</v>
<v Speaker 1>including golic speaking areas from </v>

48
00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:31.413
<v Speaker 1>England,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially from areas that had been </v>

49
00:02:32.831 --> 00:02:33.664
<v Speaker 1>under Danish control,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where North's influenced dialects were </v>

50
00:02:35.681 --> 00:02:38.740
<v Speaker 1>spoken and from farther away places like</v>
<v Speaker 1>flenders,</v>

51
00:02:38.741 --> 00:02:39.574
<v Speaker 1>phrygia and Scandinavia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>English became the common language of </v>

52
00:02:43.001 --> 00:02:45.790
<v Speaker 1>the boroughs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the multilingual environment created</v>

53
00:02:45.791 --> 00:02:48.640
<v Speaker 1>by the economic migrants had an </v>
<v Speaker 1>influence on the language,</v>

54
00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:52.300
<v Speaker 1>so as English became more widespread in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Scotland because of the boroughs,</v>

55
00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:55.420
<v Speaker 1>it also began to diverged from North </v>
<v Speaker 1>Umbria and middle English.</v>

56
00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:56.463
<v Speaker 1>Other influences were Latin because of </v>
<v Speaker 1>its role as the ecclesiastical and the </v>

57
00:03:00.101 --> 00:03:00.934
<v Speaker 1>language of laws and record keeping and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Norman French because of the influence </v>

58
00:03:04.331 --> 00:03:07.360
<v Speaker 1>of King David.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first who had close ties with Norman</v>

59
00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:08.193
<v Speaker 1>England.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The divergent variety of middle English </v>

60
00:03:09.911 --> 00:03:13.480
<v Speaker 1>that grew out of these influences is now</v>
<v Speaker 1>referred to as early Scott's,</v>

61
00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:14.373
<v Speaker 1>but at the time it continued to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>referred to as English until the end of </v>

62
00:03:17.081 --> 00:03:20.290
<v Speaker 1>the 15th century.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In the 14th and 15th centuries,</v>

63
00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:24.340
<v Speaker 1>English replaced and garlic and much of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the lowlands as well as replacing French</v>

64
00:03:24.341 --> 00:03:25.174
<v Speaker 1>as the administrative language,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as well as replacing Latin as the </v>

65
00:03:27.581 --> 00:03:28.414
<v Speaker 1>language of records and law.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Another thing that happened in the 15th </v>

66
00:03:31.031 --> 00:03:34.930
<v Speaker 1>century was that the Orkney islands and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Shetland islands came under Scottish</v>

67
00:03:34.931 --> 00:03:37.510
<v Speaker 1>rule.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Scandinavian settlers had been living on</v>

68
00:03:37.511 --> 00:03:38.344
<v Speaker 1>these islands since the ninth century </v>
<v Speaker 1>and spoke a language called norm that </v>

69
00:03:41.381 --> 00:03:44.650
<v Speaker 1>derived from old norse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but Scott speaking,</v>

70
00:03:44.651 --> 00:03:45.484
<v Speaker 1>settlers began to move there and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>prestige language became Scott's from </v>

71
00:03:48.761 --> 00:03:49.600
<v Speaker 1>this contact.</v>

72
00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:50.493
<v Speaker 1>New dialects of Scott's would develop </v>
<v Speaker 1>with more influence than other forms of </v>

73
00:03:53.861 --> 00:03:56.020
<v Speaker 1>Scott's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These dialects are shetland,</v>

74
00:03:56.021 --> 00:03:58.840
<v Speaker 1>Scott's and slash or Kadian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Scott's or orkney.</v>

75
00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:00.183
<v Speaker 1>By this point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>scots had become fairly distinct from </v>

76
00:04:02.171 --> 00:04:03.004
<v Speaker 1>English as spoken in England.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One thing that set them apart was that </v>

77
00:04:05.711 --> 00:04:09.310
<v Speaker 1>the southern English dialect of London </v>
<v Speaker 1>was becoming the standard in England,</v>

78
00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:12.490
<v Speaker 1>whereas Scott's had more in common with </v>
<v Speaker 1>the northern dialects.</v>

79
00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:15.790
<v Speaker 1>Another thing that set them apart was </v>
<v Speaker 1>the great vowel shift.</v>

80
00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:18.730
<v Speaker 1>The great vowels shift took place </v>
<v Speaker 1>between the years 13,</v>

81
00:04:18.731 --> 00:04:19.564
<v Speaker 1>15 and 1600 more or less and caused </v>
<v Speaker 1>vowels of English to be pronounced </v>

82
00:04:23.141 --> 00:04:25.360
<v Speaker 1>differently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This also affected Scott's,</v>

83
00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:26.433
<v Speaker 1>although the specific changes we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>different and some vowels that changed </v>

84
00:04:29.261 --> 00:04:31.630
<v Speaker 1>in English remained unchanged.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In Scott's,</v>

85
00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:33.610
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in middle English,</v>

86
00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:34.361
<v Speaker 1>the letters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

87
00:04:34.361 --> 00:04:37.660
<v Speaker 1>you represented the sound uhhh in </v>
<v Speaker 1>southern English,</v>

88
00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:41.080
<v Speaker 1>and thus in standard English,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this sounds shifted to our,</v>

89
00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:43.450
<v Speaker 1>but in Scott's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it remained unchanged.</v>

90
00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:46.480
<v Speaker 1>So today in standard English you say </v>
<v Speaker 1>mouse,</v>

91
00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:51.600
<v Speaker 1>but in Scott's you say Moose and a brown</v>
<v Speaker 1>cow and English is a Brune coup in scots</v>

92
00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:55.353
<v Speaker 1>who knew broom?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The great vowel shifts took place at </v>

93
00:04:58.031 --> 00:05:01.510
<v Speaker 1>about the same time that English </v>
<v Speaker 1>orthography was becoming standardized,</v>

94
00:05:01.511 --> 00:05:05.530
<v Speaker 1>so that English spelling often reflected</v>
<v Speaker 1>earlier middle English pronunciation,</v>

95
00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:08.080
<v Speaker 1>and it still does today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Scott's on the other hand,</v>

96
00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:11.260
<v Speaker 1>was written more freely to reflect the </v>
<v Speaker 1>way it was really pronounced.</v>

97
00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:12.303
<v Speaker 1>An extensive body of Scott's literature </v>
<v Speaker 1>was written in the 15th and 16th </v>

98
00:05:15.341 --> 00:05:17.860
<v Speaker 1>centuries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but towards the end of that time period,</v>

99
00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:18.723
<v Speaker 1>as English was growing in prestige,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Scott's was increasingly being written </v>

100
00:05:21.911 --> 00:05:24.160
<v Speaker 1>using a combination of scots and </v>
<v Speaker 1>English.</v>
