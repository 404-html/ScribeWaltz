<v Speaker 1>so let's get right into it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's talk about geeks.</v>

<v Speaker 1>geek.</v>

5
00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:12.743
<v Speaker 1>Perhaps the most famous geeks in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world are Otaku people who are obsessed </v>

6
00:00:16.081 --> 00:00:18.840
<v Speaker 1>with Japanese animation and comic book </v>
<v Speaker 1>culture.</v>

7
00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:20.850
<v Speaker 1>Our Mickey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you want?</v>

8
00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:23.081
<v Speaker 2>Sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mickey.</v>

9
00:00:23.081 --> 00:00:25.240
<v Speaker 2>I don't understand what you're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so hold on a second.</v>

10
00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:32.000
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

11
00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:39.063
<v Speaker 1>Hello everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Welcome to the Lange Focus Channel and </v>

12
00:00:40.781 --> 00:00:41.614
<v Speaker 1>my name is Paul.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Today's topic is the Greek language or </v>

13
00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:47.043
<v Speaker 1>as it's called in Greek.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The word Greek is a word that instantly </v>

14
00:00:49.541 --> 00:00:53.200
<v Speaker 1>brings to mind images of ancient </v>
<v Speaker 1>civilizations and culture.</v>

15
00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:56.590
<v Speaker 1>It may not be the most widely spoken </v>
<v Speaker 1>language in the world today,</v>

16
00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:57.513
<v Speaker 1>but it did play an extremely influential</v>
<v Speaker 1>role in the development of other </v>

17
00:01:00.281 --> 00:01:03.340
<v Speaker 1>European languages and in European </v>
<v Speaker 1>culture in general.</v>

18
00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:04.413
<v Speaker 1>Today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's spoken by more than 13 million </v>

19
00:01:05.831 --> 00:01:06.664
<v Speaker 1>native speakers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mainly in Greece where it's the only </v>

20
00:01:08.681 --> 00:01:11.500
<v Speaker 1>official language and a spoken by 11 </v>
<v Speaker 1>million people.</v>

21
00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:15.940
<v Speaker 1>The Republic of Cyprus where it's spoken</v>
<v Speaker 1>by around 975,000</v>

22
00:01:15.941 --> 00:01:18.730
<v Speaker 1>people and by minorities and parts of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Albania,</v>

23
00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:19.653
<v Speaker 1>Italy and Turkey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as well as by Greek immigrants living </v>

24
00:01:22.031 --> 00:01:25.510
<v Speaker 1>all around the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whether you realize it or not,</v>

25
00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:27.520
<v Speaker 1>if you know English,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know some Greek,</v>

26
00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:31.450
<v Speaker 1>around 6% of the vocabulary of English </v>
<v Speaker 1>is of Greek origin,</v>

27
00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:32.523
<v Speaker 1>and some estimates reach as high as 12 </v>
<v Speaker 1>to 15% and if we look specifically at </v>

28
00:01:36.821 --> 00:01:37.654
<v Speaker 1>the sciences and technology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the proportion of Greek words and roots </v>

29
00:01:40.301 --> 00:01:41.650
<v Speaker 1>skyrockets dramatically.</v>

30
00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:42.693
<v Speaker 1>When you mentioned the encyclopedia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or when you talk about physics class or </v>

31
00:01:45.581 --> 00:01:46.414
<v Speaker 1>when you ask for the butter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're using words that developed from </v>

32
00:01:48.941 --> 00:01:52.990
<v Speaker 1>Greek history,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Greek as a member of the Hellenic branch</v>

33
00:01:52.991 --> 00:01:53.824
<v Speaker 1>of the Indo European language family.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some consider Hellenic to be a single </v>

34
00:01:57.431 --> 00:01:59.680
<v Speaker 1>language branch consisting of only </v>
<v Speaker 1>Greek,</v>

35
00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:00.663
<v Speaker 1>while others consider some varieties of </v>
<v Speaker 1>modern Greek to be closely related but </v>

36
00:02:03.851 --> 00:02:04.684
<v Speaker 1>separate languages.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The development of Greek can be broken </v>

37
00:02:06.911 --> 00:02:10.440
<v Speaker 1>down into a number of stages.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Prodo Greek protocol,</v>

38
00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:11.283
<v Speaker 1>Greek or protocol,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hellenic developed from Prodo Indo </v>

39
00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:17.410
<v Speaker 1>European and was probably spoken in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>third millennium bce.</v>

40
00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:18.453
<v Speaker 1>Over 4,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>years ago as Hellenic people migrated </v>

41
00:02:20.891 --> 00:02:23.770
<v Speaker 1>into the Belkin peninsula,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or maybe even earlier,</v>

42
00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:28.800
<v Speaker 1>depending on where and when.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Prodo Indo European originated Mycenaean</v>

43
00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:32.230
<v Speaker 1>Greek Mycenaean Greek is the form of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Greek that developed in Mycenaean Greece</v>

44
00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:33.123
<v Speaker 1>in the second millennium bce when the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Greek mainland first advanced </v>

45
00:02:36.221 --> 00:02:39.820
<v Speaker 1>civilization arose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The earliest known Greek text comes from</v>

46
00:02:39.821 --> 00:02:43.090
<v Speaker 1>this period dating back to around 1400 </v>
<v Speaker 1>bce.</v>

47
00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:46.900
<v Speaker 1>It's a clay tablet written in a writing </v>
<v Speaker 1>system called linear b,</v>

48
00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:49.630
<v Speaker 1>not the system that we know today as the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Greek alphabet.</v>

49
00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:52.630
<v Speaker 1>The existence of such tablets makes </v>
<v Speaker 1>Greek,</v>

50
00:02:52.631 --> 00:02:55.600
<v Speaker 1>the oldest recorded living language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To be clear,</v>

51
00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:59.320
<v Speaker 1>there are older texts written in other </v>
<v Speaker 1>languages like Sumerian,</v>

52
00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:01.330
<v Speaker 1>Egyptian hieroglyphics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the KTN,</v>

53
00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:05.170
<v Speaker 1>but those are all dead languages.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While Greek has lived on until today,</v>

54
00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:06.243
<v Speaker 1>sometime toward the end of the Mycenaean</v>
<v Speaker 1>Greek stage or in the early part of the </v>

55
00:03:09.521 --> 00:03:12.730
<v Speaker 1>ancient Greek stage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Greek alphabet was adopted.</v>

56
00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:17.710
<v Speaker 1>The date of adoption is around 1100 bce </v>
<v Speaker 1>plus or minus a couple of hundred years.</v>

57
00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:18.573
<v Speaker 1>We're not quite sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Greek alphabet was derived from the </v>

58
00:03:20.831 --> 00:03:24.730
<v Speaker 1>Phoenician alphabet with Greek adopting </v>
<v Speaker 1>and modifying the finish and letters,</v>

59
00:03:24.731 --> 00:03:27.250
<v Speaker 1>and generally keeping similar sounds for</v>
<v Speaker 1>each one.</v>

60
00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:28.293
<v Speaker 1>There are also several unique Greek </v>
<v Speaker 1>letters that did not derive from </v>

61
00:03:30.701 --> 00:03:31.534
<v Speaker 1>Phoenician.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You may notice that some of the symbols </v>

62
00:03:33.491 --> 00:03:37.570
<v Speaker 1>are reversed that might be explained by </v>
<v Speaker 1>the fact that physician was written from</v>

63
00:03:37.571 --> 00:03:40.390
<v Speaker 1>right to left while Greek is written </v>
<v Speaker 1>from left to right.</v>

64
00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:42.273
<v Speaker 1>At first,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there were numerous local varieties of </v>

65
00:03:43.751 --> 00:03:44.584
<v Speaker 1>the Greek alphabet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the standard 24 letter Greek </v>

66
00:03:46.691 --> 00:03:49.810
<v Speaker 1>alphabet became widespread throughout </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Greek speaking world.</v>

67
00:03:49.811 --> 00:03:54.510
<v Speaker 1>During the fourth century bce in Cyprus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a different script called the Cypriots.</v>

68
00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:55.353
<v Speaker 1>Syllabary was used between the 11th and </v>
<v Speaker 1>fourth centuries bce when the Greek </v>

69
00:03:58.991 --> 00:04:01.600
<v Speaker 1>alphabet was finally adopted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Greek alphabet.</v>

70
00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:04.390
<v Speaker 1>What eventually give rise to numerous </v>
<v Speaker 1>other alphabets,</v>

71
00:04:04.391 --> 00:04:06.940
<v Speaker 1>including the Latin Alphabet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Coptic Alphabet,</v>

72
00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:10.630
<v Speaker 1>but the Cyrillic alphabet and the Gothic</v>
<v Speaker 1>alphabet ancient Greek.</v>

73
00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:11.583
<v Speaker 1>The adoption of the Greek alphabet took </v>
<v Speaker 1>place around the beginning of the </v>

74
00:04:13.961 --> 00:04:14.794
<v Speaker 1>ancient Greek stage of the language,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which lasted from about the ninth </v>

75
00:04:17.531 --> 00:04:20.410
<v Speaker 1>century bce until the fourth century </v>
<v Speaker 1>bce.</v>

76
00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:21.543
<v Speaker 1>This stage of the language corresponds </v>
<v Speaker 1>to the archaic and classical periods of </v>

77
00:04:24.611 --> 00:04:28.720
<v Speaker 1>Greek history,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the oldest existing Greek literature and</v>

78
00:04:28.721 --> 00:04:31.960
<v Speaker 1>indeed some of the oldest western </v>
<v Speaker 1>literature dates from this period,</v>

79
00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:35.440
<v Speaker 1>including the two epic poems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Iliad and the Odyssey,</v>

80
00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:37.000
<v Speaker 1>which are attributed to homer.</v>

81
00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:39.730
<v Speaker 1>There were various dialects of ancient </v>
<v Speaker 1>Greek at the time,</v>

82
00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:43.300
<v Speaker 1>including attic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the dialect of Athens as well as ionic.</v>

83
00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:46.150
<v Speaker 1>These epic poems were written in homeric</v>
<v Speaker 1>Greek,</v>

84
00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:50.530
<v Speaker 1>a literary form of the language based on</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ionic dialect of Greek with elements</v>

85
00:04:50.531 --> 00:04:54.640
<v Speaker 1>of some other dialects during the </v>
<v Speaker 1>classical period of Greek history.</v>

86
00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:55.623
<v Speaker 1>More texts of tremendous importance to </v>
<v Speaker 1>Western civilization were written in </v>

87
00:04:58.781 --> 00:05:01.270
<v Speaker 1>ancient Greek,</v>
<v Speaker 1>including the works of Socrates,</v>

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:02.800
<v Speaker 1>Plato,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Aristotle,</v>

89
00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:05.740
<v Speaker 1>and many texts of foundational </v>
<v Speaker 1>importance in logic,</v>

<v Speaker 1>math and science.</v>

<v Speaker 1>In the fourth century bce,</v>

92
00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:17.190
<v Speaker 1>the Greek language became widespread in </v>
<v Speaker 1>a form known as Koine Greek Qa,</v>

93
00:05:17.191 --> 00:05:18.024
<v Speaker 1>meaning common.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was based mainly on the attic and </v>

94
00:05:20.681 --> 00:05:23.530
<v Speaker 1>ionic dialects with some elements of </v>
<v Speaker 1>others as well,</v>

95
00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:26.560
<v Speaker 1>and it served as a Lingua Franca </v>
<v Speaker 1>throughout the conquered regions.</v>

96
00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:29.980
<v Speaker 1>It was spoken most widely in the eastern</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mediterranean region.</v>

97
00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.120
<v Speaker 1>A large amount of important literature </v>
<v Speaker 1>was written in Koine Greek,</v>

98
00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:36.610
<v Speaker 1>including the new testament and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>septuagint,</v>

<v Speaker 1>and became the official language of the </v>

102

<v Speaker 1>Byzantine Empire until the 15th century </v>

103
00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:52.323
<v Speaker 1>also known as Byzantine Greek,</v>
<v Speaker 1>developed from Koine Greek during the </v>

104
00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:56.260
<v Speaker 1>Byzantine Empire.</v>

105

<v Speaker 1>During this period,</v>

106
00:05:58.851 --> 00:06:01.610
<v Speaker 1>a Greek began to develop towards modern </v>
<v Speaker 1>Greek.</v>

107
00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:02.593
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Written Greek tended to be more </v>

108
00:06:03.501 --> 00:06:07.280
<v Speaker 1>conservative and similar to ancient </v>
<v Speaker 1>Greek modern Greek.</v>

109
00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:11.630
<v Speaker 1>The end of the Byzantine Empire marks </v>
<v Speaker 1>the beginning of the modern Greek period</v>

110
00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:14.720
<v Speaker 1>during the modern Greek period,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two forms of Grieco rose.</v>

111
00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:19.790
<v Speaker 1>The first was demotic or Zemo Tki,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which means by the people.</v>

112
00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:22.460
<v Speaker 1>This is the modern spoken form of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Greek language.</v>

113
00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:23.323
<v Speaker 1>The second was a literary form of Greek </v>
<v Speaker 1>with features of both demotic Greek and </v>

114
00:06:28.251 --> 00:06:31.190
<v Speaker 1>ancient Greek.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This resulted in a state of dye glossier</v>

115
00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:32.053
<v Speaker 1>with the spoken language and the formal </v>
<v Speaker 1>written language being significantly </v>

116
00:06:35.031 --> 00:06:35.864
<v Speaker 1>different until the adoption of demotic </v>
<v Speaker 1>as the official language of Greece in </v>

117
00:06:39.081 --> 00:06:43.970
<v Speaker 1>1976 that form of demotic is referred to</v>
<v Speaker 1>as standard modern Greek.</v>

118
00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:46.520
<v Speaker 1>There are several dialects of modern </v>
<v Speaker 1>Greek as well.</v>

119
00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:48.240
<v Speaker 1>Northern dialect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ionian,</v>

120
00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:52.340
<v Speaker 1>Peloponnesian dialects,</v>
<v Speaker 1>southern dialects is that Konijn all the</v>

121
00:06:52.341 --> 00:06:53.174
<v Speaker 1>Athenian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's also the Cypriot dialect </v>

122
00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:58.610
<v Speaker 1>spoken on the island of Cyprus with one </v>
<v Speaker 1>exception,</v>

123
00:06:58.670 --> 00:07:00.530
<v Speaker 1>the endangered saccone and dialect.</v>

124
00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:03.530
<v Speaker 1>All forms of modern Greek developed from</v>
<v Speaker 1>Koine Greek.</v>

125
00:07:03.950 --> 00:07:07.190
<v Speaker 1>Despite this long history and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>different stages of development,</v>

126
00:07:07.250 --> 00:07:08.083
<v Speaker 1>the Greek language has changed </v>
<v Speaker 1>relatively little compared to other </v>

127
00:07:10.401 --> 00:07:11.234
<v Speaker 1>languages during the same timeframe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My understanding is that speakers of </v>

128
00:07:14.241 --> 00:07:15.074
<v Speaker 1>modern Greek can look at an ancient </v>
<v Speaker 1>Greek text and recognize a lot of </v>

129
00:07:18.081 --> 00:07:20.420
<v Speaker 1>familiar vocabulary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of familiar words,</v>

130
00:07:20.570 --> 00:07:23.030
<v Speaker 1>even if they can't make sense of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>sentence itself.</v>

131
00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:24.013
<v Speaker 1>This relative lack of change in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>language is probably the result of </v>

132
00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:31.010
<v Speaker 1>ancient Greeks continued influence on </v>
<v Speaker 1>written Greek throughout the centuries.</v>

133
00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:31.993
<v Speaker 1>So what is Greek like?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's examine some of the features of </v>

134
00:07:34.671 --> 00:07:37.490
<v Speaker 1>Greek,</v>
<v Speaker 1>specifically modern Greek syntax.</v>

135
00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:41.950
<v Speaker 1>There's disagreement over whether Greeks</v>
<v Speaker 1>default word order is Svo or V,</v>

136
00:07:41.951 --> 00:07:45.290
<v Speaker 1>s o,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the most common word order is Svo.</v>

137
00:07:45.350 --> 00:07:46.490
<v Speaker 1>Look at this sentence here</v>

138
00:07:46.820 --> 00:07:48.760
<v Speaker 3>in the Smi Lama in Unica,</v>

139
00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:52.630
<v Speaker 1>this sentence means we speak Greek.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's the subject,</v>

140
00:07:52.690 --> 00:07:55.120
<v Speaker 1>the verb and the object.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But in Greek,</v>

141
00:07:55.121 --> 00:07:57.340
<v Speaker 1>the subject Pronoun is not always </v>
<v Speaker 1>necessary.</v>

142
00:07:58.010 --> 00:07:59.430
<v Speaker 3>Neelam aliens.</v>

143
00:07:59.980 --> 00:08:00.813
<v Speaker 1>The subject pronouns isn't necessary </v>
<v Speaker 1>here because we know from the verb </v>

144
00:08:03.341 --> 00:08:05.770
<v Speaker 1>conjugation that this is the first </v>
<v Speaker 1>person plural.</v>

145
00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:06.913
<v Speaker 1>So if the subject Pronoun is typically </v>
<v Speaker 1>used when you want to draw attention to </v>

146
00:08:09.791 --> 00:08:10.624
<v Speaker 1>it or make it the topic of the sentence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>despite Svo being the most common word </v>

147
00:08:14.261 --> 00:08:15.094
<v Speaker 1>order in Greek,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the words can actually be arranged in </v>

148
00:08:16.661 --> 00:08:17.494
<v Speaker 1>different ways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Usually to put focus on one element of </v>

149
00:08:19.811 --> 00:08:23.140
<v Speaker 1>the sentence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's a sentence that means niece loves</v>

150
00:08:23.141 --> 00:08:23.974
<v Speaker 1>Maria.</v>

151
00:08:24.100 --> 00:08:26.380
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>young niece Maria.</v>

152
00:08:26.690 --> 00:08:27.523
<v Speaker 1>This sentence here is Svo and notice </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the definite article comes before </v>

153
00:08:30.741 --> 00:08:31.580
<v Speaker 1>proper names.</v>

154
00:08:32.190 --> 00:08:34.510
<v Speaker 3>Maria [inaudible]</v>

155
00:08:34.870 --> 00:08:36.760
<v Speaker 1>this time it's Oh v S</v>

156
00:08:37.940 --> 00:08:40.120
<v Speaker 3>oh young is demaria of a pie.</v>

157
00:08:40.550 --> 00:08:44.350
<v Speaker 1>This time it's s o.</v>
<v Speaker 1>V.</v>

158
00:08:44.350 --> 00:08:44.590
<v Speaker 1>See Maria</v>

159
00:08:44.590 --> 00:08:46.000
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible]</v>

160
00:08:46.790 --> 00:08:50.210
<v Speaker 1>this time it's o s v.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These three word orders.</v>

161
00:08:50.211 --> 00:08:53.660
<v Speaker 1>Here are all ways of drawing focus to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the object of the sentence.</v>

162
00:08:53.810 --> 00:08:57.630
<v Speaker 1>It's possible to change the order of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>words like this because grammatical case</v>

163
00:08:57.631 --> 00:09:01.290
<v Speaker 1>inflections tell us the nouns function </v>
<v Speaker 1>even if it's in a different location.</v>

164
00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:04.020
<v Speaker 1>There are four grammatical cases in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Greek,</v>

165
00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:05.580
<v Speaker 1>nominative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>genitive,</v>

166
00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:07.380
<v Speaker 1>accusative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Vocativ.</v>

167
00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:09.930
<v Speaker 1>Incentives is like these with proper </v>
<v Speaker 1>names.</v>

168
00:09:09.990 --> 00:09:12.390
<v Speaker 1>The names themselves don't have case </v>
<v Speaker 1>inflections,</v>

169
00:09:12.450 --> 00:09:16.230
<v Speaker 1>but the definite articles do notice that</v>
<v Speaker 1>the two definite articles or different,</v>

170
00:09:16.530 --> 00:09:17.363
<v Speaker 1>we'll come back to that in a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's look at another sentence and see </v>

171
00:09:19.771 --> 00:09:21.240
<v Speaker 1>the nouns.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Case inflection.</v>

172
00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:28.370
<v Speaker 1>This sentence means I lost my new </v>
<v Speaker 1>glasses word for word.</v>

173
00:09:28.371 --> 00:09:31.940
<v Speaker 1>It's lost I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which we know from the inflection,</v>

174
00:09:32.030 --> 00:09:36.530
<v Speaker 1>the new glasses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my this word,</v>

175
00:09:37.730 --> 00:09:41.330
<v Speaker 1>which means glasses is an inflected form</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the neuter Noun,</v>

176
00:09:42.650 --> 00:09:45.020
<v Speaker 1>which means glass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the nominative,</v>

177
00:09:45.021 --> 00:09:47.810
<v Speaker 1>accusative and Vocativ plural form.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

178
00:09:47.811 --> 00:09:50.120
<v Speaker 1>it can be all three of those.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Also,</v>

179
00:09:50.121 --> 00:09:50.954
<v Speaker 1>the definite article is inflected to </v>
<v Speaker 1>agree with the now this is the nuture </v>

180
00:09:54.130 --> 00:09:54.963
<v Speaker 1>nominative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>accusative plural form of the definite </v>

181
00:09:56.781 --> 00:09:57.900
<v Speaker 1>article.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As you can see,</v>

182
00:09:57.950 --> 00:10:00.500
<v Speaker 1>there are several other forms of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>definite article too.</v>

183
00:10:00.710 --> 00:10:03.080
<v Speaker 1>Let's go back to an earlier sentence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For a second.</v>

184
00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:04.393
<v Speaker 1>This definite article here before young </v>
<v Speaker 1>niece is in the masculine singular </v>

185
00:10:07.700 --> 00:10:08.533
<v Speaker 1>nominative form and this definite </v>
<v Speaker 1>article here before Maria is in the </v>

186
00:10:12.231 --> 00:10:16.340
<v Speaker 1>feminine singular accusative form.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even when the word order changed,</v>

187
00:10:16.370 --> 00:10:20.420
<v Speaker 1>the definite article stayed the same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Allowing us to know which person was the</v>

188
00:10:20.421 --> 00:10:21.254
<v Speaker 1>subject,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the nominative case and which one was </v>

189
00:10:23.271 --> 00:10:25.460
<v Speaker 1>the object,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the accusative case.</v>

190
00:10:26.090 --> 00:10:26.923
<v Speaker 1>Also the adjective is inflected to agree</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the now this is the nuder </v>

191
00:10:29.841 --> 00:10:31.010
<v Speaker 1>nominative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>accusative,</v>

192
00:10:31.011 --> 00:10:31.844
<v Speaker 1>vocativ plural form.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now let's change the noun in the </v>

193
00:10:34.581 --> 00:10:36.110
<v Speaker 1>sentence and see what happens.</v>

194
00:10:39.490 --> 00:10:40.323
<v Speaker 1>This means I lost my new dog this time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Noun is inflected to show the </v>

195
00:10:43.871 --> 00:10:44.704
<v Speaker 1>masculine singular accusative form.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The definite article is also in the </v>

196
00:10:47.981 --> 00:10:51.940
<v Speaker 1>masculine singular accusative form and </v>
<v Speaker 1>so as the adjective.</v>

197
00:10:52.420 --> 00:10:53.253
<v Speaker 1>The main thing I want you to notice here</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that the now but also the words that </v>

198
00:10:55.841 --> 00:10:56.674
<v Speaker 1>come together with the now like the </v>
<v Speaker 1>definite article and the adjective </v>

199
00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:03.790
<v Speaker 1>change form to showcase,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also gender and number verbs.</v>

200
00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:07.390
<v Speaker 1>Greek verbs have two different stems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two different forms.</v>

201
00:11:07.570 --> 00:11:08.403
<v Speaker 1>One to show perfect mood,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which means an action is complete and </v>

202
00:11:11.710 --> 00:11:15.160
<v Speaker 1>one to show imperfect mood,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which means an action is incomplete.</v>

203
00:11:15.340 --> 00:11:16.173
<v Speaker 1>Then various affixes particles and </v>
<v Speaker 1>auxiliary verbs are added to these two </v>

204
00:11:19.451 --> 00:11:22.090
<v Speaker 1>stems to show past tense and non past </v>
<v Speaker 1>tense.</v>

205
00:11:22.180 --> 00:11:23.013
<v Speaker 1>Let's examine the meaning to help.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the perfect stem showing </v>

206
00:11:26.091 --> 00:11:30.500
<v Speaker 1>completed action Wli thesis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is the imperfect stem.</v>

207
00:11:32.330 --> 00:11:35.780
<v Speaker 1>Now let's look at how to create some </v>
<v Speaker 1>verb tenses based on these stems.</v>

208
00:11:35.810 --> 00:11:36.643
<v Speaker 1>Here's the present tense voice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This means I am helping my friend and </v>

209
00:11:41.361 --> 00:11:44.300
<v Speaker 1>this could also mean I helped my friend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In a general sense,</v>

210
00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:48.290
<v Speaker 1>the present tense form is based on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>imperfect stem because the action is not</v>

211
00:11:48.291 --> 00:11:49.850
<v Speaker 1>complete yet it's happening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

212
00:11:50.060 --> 00:11:52.390
<v Speaker 1>here's the imperfect tense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very suicidal.</v>

213
00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:57.650
<v Speaker 1>This means I was helping my friend or I </v>
<v Speaker 1>used to help my friend.</v>

214
00:11:57.800 --> 00:12:00.170
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this form is based on the imperfect stem</v>

215
00:12:00.290 --> 00:12:03.530
<v Speaker 1>because the action was continuing at a </v>
<v Speaker 1>certain point in the past.</v>

216
00:12:04.220 --> 00:12:05.510
<v Speaker 1>Now here's the simple past</v>

217
00:12:05.730 --> 00:12:07.470
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible].</v>

218
00:12:07.710 --> 00:12:08.543
<v Speaker 1>This means I helped my friend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The simple past is based on the perfect </v>

219
00:12:11.731 --> 00:12:13.860
<v Speaker 1>verb stem because the action is </v>
<v Speaker 1>complete.</v>

220
00:12:14.460 --> 00:12:15.260
<v Speaker 1>Future</v>

221
00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:16.970
<v Speaker 4>Savoy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You see sort of feeling</v>

222
00:12:17.350 --> 00:12:21.520
<v Speaker 1>this means I will help my friend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The simple future tense is also based on</v>

223
00:12:21.521 --> 00:12:24.760
<v Speaker 1>the perfect stem because it's an action </v>
<v Speaker 1>with a start and a finish.</v>

224
00:12:24.790 --> 00:12:28.660
<v Speaker 1>It's not a continuing action and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>present perfect</v>

225
00:12:29.090 --> 00:12:31.960
<v Speaker 4>cc [inaudible] Flores.</v>

226
00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:34.780
<v Speaker 1>This means I have helped my friend many </v>
<v Speaker 1>times,</v>

227
00:12:35.410 --> 00:12:38.080
<v Speaker 1>the present perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's also based on the perfect stem,</v>

228
00:12:38.290 --> 00:12:41.740
<v Speaker 1>as you might've guessed from its name,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because the action has been done at some</v>

229
00:12:41.741 --> 00:12:45.010
<v Speaker 1>point in the past.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Also notice the auxiliary verb,</v>

230
00:12:45.070 --> 00:12:47.830
<v Speaker 1>which is the first person singular form </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the verb,</v>

231
00:12:47.831 --> 00:12:48.664
<v Speaker 1>meaning to have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's look at one final Greek sentence </v>

232
00:12:51.371 --> 00:12:52.630
<v Speaker 1>and see what we discover</v>

233
00:12:53.830 --> 00:12:57.430
<v Speaker 4>in this [inaudible].</v>

234
00:12:57.600 --> 00:13:00.240
<v Speaker 1>The sentence means we fell in love and </v>
<v Speaker 1>got married.</v>

235
00:13:00.241 --> 00:13:01.830
<v Speaker 1>Immediately.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Word for word it.</v>

236
00:13:01.980 --> 00:13:04.440
<v Speaker 1>We fall in love,</v>
<v Speaker 1>past tense.</v>

237
00:13:04.500 --> 00:13:05.550
<v Speaker 1>First person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>plural,</v>

238
00:13:05.551 --> 00:13:08.430
<v Speaker 1>inflection and get married.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Past tense.</v>

239
00:13:08.490 --> 00:13:09.600
<v Speaker 1>First person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>plural.</v>

240
00:13:09.690 --> 00:13:11.610
<v Speaker 1>Immediately.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This verb,</v>

241
00:13:11.730 --> 00:13:14.130
<v Speaker 1>it'll tell them it means to fall in </v>
<v Speaker 1>love.</v>

242
00:13:14.370 --> 00:13:19.370
<v Speaker 1>This verb means to get married.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This ending is the first person,</v>

243
00:13:19.621 --> 00:13:21.330
<v Speaker 1>plural,</v>
<v Speaker 1>past tense conjugation.</v>

244
00:13:21.420 --> 00:13:25.320
<v Speaker 1>This piece here show us past tense and </v>
<v Speaker 1>this piece shows number and person.</v>

245
00:13:25.920 --> 00:13:30.000
<v Speaker 1>These two verbs are not active verbs but</v>
<v Speaker 1>rather medio passive verbs.</v>

246
00:13:30.060 --> 00:13:33.210
<v Speaker 1>You might see the word passive there and</v>
<v Speaker 1>think that these are passive verbs,</v>

247
00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:35.850
<v Speaker 1>but medio passive verbs are not always </v>
<v Speaker 1>passive.</v>

248
00:13:36.060 --> 00:13:39.390
<v Speaker 1>They might also be intransitive or </v>
<v Speaker 1>reflexive or reciprocal.</v>

249
00:13:39.450 --> 00:13:41.460
<v Speaker 1>In this case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they seem to be reciprocal,</v>

250
00:13:41.490 --> 00:13:45.120
<v Speaker 1>meaning that both people are doing the </v>
<v Speaker 1>action to each other or with each other.</v>

251
00:13:45.660 --> 00:13:49.470
<v Speaker 1>This ending here on the dictionary form </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the verb is a hint that it's a medial</v>

252
00:13:49.471 --> 00:13:50.304
<v Speaker 1>passive verb.</v>

253
00:13:50.640 --> 00:13:51.473
<v Speaker 1>One of the main things you may have </v>
<v Speaker 1>noticed about Greek is that it's a </v>

254
00:13:53.641 --> 00:13:54.474
<v Speaker 1>highly inflected language with lots of </v>
<v Speaker 1>different word forms and lots of </v>

255
00:13:57.061 --> 00:13:57.894
<v Speaker 1>different endings that can attach to </v>
<v Speaker 1>nouns and to verb stems and that might </v>

256
00:14:00.841 --> 00:14:01.674
<v Speaker 1>seem kind of intimidating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there are lots of languages out </v>

257
00:14:03.961 --> 00:14:06.210
<v Speaker 1>there that are much more inflected then </v>
<v Speaker 1>Greek,</v>

258
00:14:06.211 --> 00:14:07.044
<v Speaker 1>so please don't be scared of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The story of the Greek language is a </v>

259
00:14:09.601 --> 00:14:10.434
<v Speaker 1>very long and spectacular one and </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's so much to say about Greek that </v>

260
00:14:13.021 --> 00:14:13.854
<v Speaker 1>we can't fit into this video,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but hopefully you were a little bit </v>

261
00:14:15.871 --> 00:14:19.920
<v Speaker 1>inspired to learn more about Greek.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the oldest languages in the world</v>

262
00:14:19.950 --> 00:14:24.270
<v Speaker 1>and a language that has influenced many </v>
<v Speaker 1>other languages and the very foundations</v>

263
00:14:24.271 --> 00:14:26.880
<v Speaker 1>of Western civilization and thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

264
00:14:26.910 --> 00:14:29.790
<v Speaker 1>the question of the day to native </v>
<v Speaker 1>speakers of Greek,</v>

265
00:14:30.060 --> 00:14:32.970
<v Speaker 1>how well can you understand written </v>
<v Speaker 1>Greek from the past,</v>

266
00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:37.170
<v Speaker 1>like Koine Greek and ancient Greek,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and to people who have studied Greek?</v>

267
00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:40.530
<v Speaker 1>What did you find challenging and not so</v>
<v Speaker 1>challenging about Greek?</v>
