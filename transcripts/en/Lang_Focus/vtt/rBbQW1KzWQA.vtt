00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:01.283
<v Speaker 1>Hello everyone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>welcome to the Lange Focus Channel and </v>

2
00:00:03.021 --> 00:00:03.854
<v Speaker 1>my name is Paul.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Today's topic is the Dutch language </v>

3
00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:08.700
<v Speaker 1>Dutch as a language that's spoken mainly</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Europe,</v>

4
00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:10.890
<v Speaker 1>but also in a few other places around </v>
<v Speaker 1>the world.</v>

5
00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:11.903
<v Speaker 1>It has $23,</v>
<v Speaker 1>million native speakers and around $28 </v>

6
00:00:14.731 --> 00:00:17.610
<v Speaker 1>million speakers in total,</v>
<v Speaker 1>including second language speakers.</v>

7
00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:18.593
<v Speaker 1>It is most widely spoken in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Netherlands where it has around $16 </v>

8
00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:22.073
<v Speaker 1>million native speakers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has also spoken by around 60 percent </v>

9
00:00:24.331 --> 00:00:25.164
<v Speaker 1>of the population of Belgium,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mostly in the northern region of </v>

10
00:00:27.301 --> 00:00:28.134
<v Speaker 1>Flanders.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's around six point $5 million </v>

11
00:00:29.641 --> 00:00:30.474
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's also spoken by a small number of </v>

12
00:00:32.041 --> 00:00:34.110
<v Speaker 1>people across the border in French </v>
<v Speaker 1>Flanders,</v>

13
00:00:34.111 --> 00:00:37.080
<v Speaker 1>which lies adjacent to Belgium,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but only around 20,000</v>

14
00:00:37.081 --> 00:00:39.660
<v Speaker 1>people there still speak it on a regular</v>
<v Speaker 1>basis.</v>

15
00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:40.703
<v Speaker 1>It has also spoken in the South American</v>
<v Speaker 1>nation of Suriname where it has around </v>

16
00:00:43.951 --> 00:00:44.784
<v Speaker 1>350,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>native speakers as well as around </v>

17
00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.090
<v Speaker 1>$250,000.</v>

18
00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:48.923
<v Speaker 1>Second language speakers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is also an official language on the </v>

19
00:00:50.941 --> 00:00:53.280
<v Speaker 1>island of Aruba,</v>
<v Speaker 1>along with the language poppy,</v>

20
00:00:53.281 --> 00:00:54.114
<v Speaker 1>a mental,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but few of the hundred thousand people </v>

21
00:00:55.471 --> 00:00:58.290
<v Speaker 1>that are actually used Dutch even though</v>
<v Speaker 1>they all learn it in school.</v>

22
00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.460
<v Speaker 1>It has also spoken in Jira,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so where it is spoken by around 15,000</v>

23
00:01:02.461 --> 00:01:06.180
<v Speaker 1>people as a native language and by many </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the other 140,000</v>

24
00:01:06.181 --> 00:01:07.014
<v Speaker 1>people as a second language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is also an official language in Sint </v>

25
00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:10.673
<v Speaker 1>Maarten along with English.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A couple of thousand people there speak </v>

26
00:01:12.481 --> 00:01:13.314
<v Speaker 1>Dutch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but English is actually much more </v>

27
00:01:14.191 --> 00:01:15.024
<v Speaker 1>common.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is also Afrikaans language spoken </v>

28
00:01:17.071 --> 00:01:17.904
<v Speaker 1>in South Africa and Namibia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a daughter language of Dutch </v>

29
00:01:20.401 --> 00:01:22.470
<v Speaker 1>and is mutually intelligible to some </v>
<v Speaker 1>extent,</v>

30
00:01:22.471 --> 00:01:26.400
<v Speaker 1>but I'll leave Africans out for now and </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll speak about it in a different video</v>

31
00:01:26.401 --> 00:01:27.234
<v Speaker 1>in the future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dutch as a member of the West dramatic </v>

32
00:01:28.981 --> 00:01:32.460
<v Speaker 1>branch of the dramatic language family,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which also includes Afrikaans,</v>

33
00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.010
<v Speaker 1>Friesian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>English and German among others.</v>

34
00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:38.430
<v Speaker 1>Dutch is one of the languages that is </v>
<v Speaker 1>most closely related to English.</v>

35
00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:39.353
<v Speaker 1>Actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Phrygian is more closely related to </v>

36
00:01:40.771 --> 00:01:41.730
<v Speaker 1>English,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then Dutches,</v>

37
00:01:41.731 --> 00:01:42.564
<v Speaker 1>but Dutch is a close second and a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>people say that Dutch is quite similar </v>

38
00:01:45.481 --> 00:01:46.680
<v Speaker 1>to German too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

39
00:01:46.681 --> 00:01:50.220
<v Speaker 1>some people say that Dutch lies </v>
<v Speaker 1>somewhere between English and German.</v>

40
00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.350
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not a very precise statement,</v>

41
00:01:52.351 --> 00:01:55.440
<v Speaker 1>but I think there is some truth to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The history of Dutch,</v>

42
00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:58.380
<v Speaker 1>all dramatic language is developed from </v>
<v Speaker 1>Provo Germanic,</v>

43
00:01:58.381 --> 00:01:59.214
<v Speaker 1>which was spoken around 500 bce in </v>
<v Speaker 1>northern continental Europe and also in </v>

44
00:02:02.701 --> 00:02:03.534
<v Speaker 1>Scandinavia by the second century ce.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It had begun diverging into distinct </v>

45
00:02:07.171 --> 00:02:08.004
<v Speaker 1>northern western and eastern dialects.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Western dialect is the ancestor of </v>

46
00:02:11.491 --> 00:02:13.890
<v Speaker 1>Dutch and have all of the West Germanic </v>
<v Speaker 1>languages.</v>

47
00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:16.320
<v Speaker 1>Variation developed in the western </v>
<v Speaker 1>dialects,</v>

48
00:02:16.321 --> 00:02:17.154
<v Speaker 1>but all of its varieties remained </v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligible until around the eighth </v>

49
00:02:19.651 --> 00:02:20.484
<v Speaker 1>century CE.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But by then a series of sound changes </v>

50
00:02:22.861 --> 00:02:25.350
<v Speaker 1>had begun to take place that made old </v>
<v Speaker 1>high German,</v>

51
00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:26.213
<v Speaker 1>the ancestor of modern German,</v>
<v Speaker 1>much more distinct from the other </v>

52
00:02:28.411 --> 00:02:29.520
<v Speaker 1>western manic languages.</v>

53
00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:31.650
<v Speaker 1>For more information on German that it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>history,</v>

54
00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:35.070
<v Speaker 1>check out my video on German,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right to hear old Dutch.</v>

55
00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:35.963
<v Speaker 1>Also known as old low Franconian </v>
<v Speaker 1>remained unaffected by the changes that </v>

56
00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:41.160
<v Speaker 1>affected old high German,</v>
<v Speaker 1>also unaffected.</v>

57
00:02:41.161 --> 00:02:43.590
<v Speaker 1>We're old Saxon Bolt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Friesian and old English,</v>

58
00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:47.220
<v Speaker 1>but those languages underwent a </v>
<v Speaker 1>different series of sound changes,</v>

59
00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:48.173
<v Speaker 1>but again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dutch was mostly unaffected by these </v>

60
00:02:49.561 --> 00:02:53.880
<v Speaker 1>changes to middle Dutch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>old Dutch developed into Middle Dutch,</v>

61
00:02:53.881 --> 00:02:57.660
<v Speaker 1>which was spoken and written between </v>
<v Speaker 1>1150 and 1500 cd.</v>

62
00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:58.733
<v Speaker 1>It was a rich literary periods and </v>
<v Speaker 1>literature from this time period is </v>

63
00:03:01.181 --> 00:03:02.014
<v Speaker 1>often quite readable for speakers of </v>
<v Speaker 1>modern Dutch because Dutch is quite a </v>

64
00:03:04.841 --> 00:03:07.870
<v Speaker 1>conservative language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Middle Dutch developed into modern Dutch</v>

65
00:03:07.871 --> 00:03:08.704
<v Speaker 1>by the middle of the 16th century.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The process of the standardization of </v>

66
00:03:11.531 --> 00:03:12.364
<v Speaker 1>Dutch began in the year 14,</v>
<v Speaker 1>77 at the end of the Middle Dutch </v>

67
00:03:15.191 --> 00:03:16.024
<v Speaker 1>period.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The dialects of flenders and Brad bond </v>

68
00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:19.210
<v Speaker 1>were most influential at that time.</v>

69
00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:20.223
<v Speaker 1>Then in the 16th century,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the move to standardization became </v>

70
00:03:22.421 --> 00:03:26.170
<v Speaker 1>stronger with the end top dialect being </v>
<v Speaker 1>the most influential in the year.</v>

71
00:03:26.171 --> 00:03:27.460
<v Speaker 1>16,</v>
<v Speaker 1>37,</v>

72
00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:28.323
<v Speaker 1>the first major Dutch Bible translation </v>
<v Speaker 1>known as starts in and had been </v>

73
00:03:32.471 --> 00:03:33.304
<v Speaker 1>published.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It hasn't been translated in such a way </v>

74
00:03:34.931 --> 00:03:37.930
<v Speaker 1>that people from all over the country </v>
<v Speaker 1>could read and understand it.</v>

75
00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:38.853
<v Speaker 1>This Bible was read by nearly everyone </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it helped greatly in the </v>

76
00:03:41.261 --> 00:03:43.690
<v Speaker 1>standardization of Dutch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the southern Netherlands.</v>

77
00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:46.750
<v Speaker 1>Now Belgium and Luxembourg were separate</v>
<v Speaker 1>and under Spanish,</v>

78
00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:48.340
<v Speaker 1>Austrian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then French rule.</v>

79
00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:51.190
<v Speaker 1>More than half of the people in Belgium </v>
<v Speaker 1>spoke a dialect of Dutch,</v>

80
00:03:51.191 --> 00:03:54.220
<v Speaker 1>but French was most widely used in </v>
<v Speaker 1>public life in schools,</v>

81
00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:55.063
<v Speaker 1>etc.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So dutch remained unstandardized there </v>

82
00:03:57.011 --> 00:03:57.844
<v Speaker 1>until the 19th century when the flemish </v>
<v Speaker 1>movement started standing up for the </v>

83
00:04:00.671 --> 00:04:01.504
<v Speaker 1>rights of dutch speakers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They adopted the Same standard language </v>

84
00:04:04.061 --> 00:04:04.894
<v Speaker 1>used in the Netherlands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>NowaDays in both the Netherlands and in </v>

85
00:04:07.211 --> 00:04:08.044
<v Speaker 1>flanders,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the northern dutch speaking region of </v>

86
00:04:09.371 --> 00:04:09.850
<v Speaker 1>Belgium.</v>

87
00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:10.683
<v Speaker 1>The situation is similar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are a number of spoken varieties </v>

88
00:04:13.031 --> 00:04:13.864
<v Speaker 1>of dutch as well as a standard language,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the difference lies mainly in </v>

89
00:04:16.751 --> 00:04:19.900
<v Speaker 1>pronunciation of standard dutch and in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the local dialects used.</v>

90
00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:20.943
<v Speaker 1>The dialects of flenders tend to be more</v>
<v Speaker 1>conservative and use more older dutch </v>

91
00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:25.870
<v Speaker 1>vocabulary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Regional languages.</v>

92
00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:26.853
<v Speaker 1>There are dutch dialects,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there are also different regional </v>

93
00:04:28.811 --> 00:04:32.320
<v Speaker 1>languages that are west dramatic </v>
<v Speaker 1>languages and closely related to dutch,</v>

94
00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:33.183
<v Speaker 1>but not as closely related as the </v>
<v Speaker 1>dialects that are considered part of </v>

95
00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:36.553
<v Speaker 1>dutch regional languages in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Netherlands include friction in the </v>

96
00:04:39.131 --> 00:04:42.340
<v Speaker 1>northern province of friesland,</v>
<v Speaker 1>low saxon and the northeast,</v>

97
00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:43.233
<v Speaker 1>and there are various dialects of low </v>
<v Speaker 1>saxon and lindbergh ish or east low </v>

98
00:04:46.541 --> 00:04:51.490
<v Speaker 1>franconia in the se lo saxon spreads </v>
<v Speaker 1>across the border with Germany and forms</v>

99
00:04:51.491 --> 00:04:54.100
<v Speaker 1>part of a dialect continuum between </v>
<v Speaker 1>dutch and german.</v>

100
00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:55.083
<v Speaker 1>If you've seen my german video,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know that the dialects in northern </v>

101
00:04:57.161 --> 00:04:57.994
<v Speaker 1>Germany are referred to as low german </v>
<v Speaker 1>and can be considered a separate </v>

102
00:05:00.461 --> 00:05:00.940
<v Speaker 1>language.</v>

103
00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:01.773
<v Speaker 1>The dutch low saxon dialects are closely</v>
<v Speaker 1>related to the low german dialects </v>

104
00:05:04.541 --> 00:05:06.970
<v Speaker 1>across the border.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is also true for linda borgess,</v>

105
00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:07.833
<v Speaker 1>which is related to franconia and </v>
<v Speaker 1>dialects spoken across the border in </v>

106
00:05:09.971 --> 00:05:10.804
<v Speaker 1>Germany.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It should be noted that dutch dialects </v>

107
00:05:12.161 --> 00:05:12.994
<v Speaker 1>and regional languages are in decline </v>
<v Speaker 1>with standard dutch becoming more </v>

108
00:05:15.731 --> 00:05:16.564
<v Speaker 1>widespread and with some people speaking</v>
<v Speaker 1>a kind of combination of standard dutch </v>

109
00:05:19.451 --> 00:05:22.300
<v Speaker 1>with some dialectal features.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what is dutch like?</v>

110
00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:24.730
<v Speaker 1>Dutchess,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not mutually intelligible with english,</v>

111
00:05:24.731 --> 00:05:25.564
<v Speaker 1>but you will often notice cognitive </v>
<v Speaker 1>vocabulary and at the most basic level </v>

112
00:05:28.601 --> 00:05:29.434
<v Speaker 1>you will notice similar grammar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you disregard the details and just </v>

113
00:05:31.691 --> 00:05:32.524
<v Speaker 1>look at the most basic sentences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Occasionally there are sentences in </v>

114
00:05:34.931 --> 00:05:37.540
<v Speaker 1>dutch that might be strangely familiar </v>
<v Speaker 1>to english speakers.</v>

115
00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:40.060
<v Speaker 1>For example of this year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this means,</v>

116
00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:42.090
<v Speaker 1>what is your name?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Man amish to duke.</v>

117
00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:45.420
<v Speaker 1>This means my name is luke to beach,</v>
<v Speaker 1>drunk beach.</v>

118
00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:48.820
<v Speaker 1>This one means the bear drank beer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I must have gotten that one from</v>

119
00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:50.700
<v Speaker 1>duolingo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This neat fit.</v>

120
00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:51.723
<v Speaker 1>This means it is not far these news.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This means that is good news now at all </v>

121
00:05:57.090 --> 00:05:57.923
<v Speaker 1>dutch sentences were so similar to </v>
<v Speaker 1>english than the two languages could </v>

122
00:06:00.171 --> 00:06:02.450
<v Speaker 1>probably be quite intelligible with each</v>
<v Speaker 1>other,</v>

123
00:06:02.451 --> 00:06:05.150
<v Speaker 1>but most sentences are not that similar </v>
<v Speaker 1>to english,</v>

124
00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:07.490
<v Speaker 1>but you will see a lot of cognitive </v>
<v Speaker 1>vocabulary,</v>

125
00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:09.260
<v Speaker 1>grammar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>similar to german,</v>

126
00:06:09.261 --> 00:06:12.260
<v Speaker 1>dutch as a language that places verbs at</v>
<v Speaker 1>the end of the sentence,</v>

127
00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:13.153
<v Speaker 1>after the first initial group.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's underlying structure is </v>

128
00:06:15.171 --> 00:06:18.470
<v Speaker 1>basically sov,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the first verb is in second position</v>

129
00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:19.363
<v Speaker 1>after the subject.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if there's only one verb in the </v>

130
00:06:20.991 --> 00:06:22.790
<v Speaker 1>sentence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then it's basically like svo.</v>

131
00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.820
<v Speaker 1>Here's a sentence with one verb him </v>
<v Speaker 1>belief.</v>

132
00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:28.400
<v Speaker 1>This means I am writing a letter word by</v>
<v Speaker 1>word.</v>

133
00:06:28.401 --> 00:06:29.234
<v Speaker 1>This is like I write a letter just like </v>
<v Speaker 1>english with the bourbon second </v>

134
00:06:32.691 --> 00:06:33.200
<v Speaker 1>position.</v>

135
00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:36.350
<v Speaker 1>Here's the sentence with two verbs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He can fuel you have of liquors cave,</v>

136
00:06:36.351 --> 00:06:39.710
<v Speaker 1>and this means I want to give you some </v>
<v Speaker 1>goodies word by word.</v>

137
00:06:39.711 --> 00:06:44.150
<v Speaker 1>It's I want you indirect object.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some goodies give in the sentence.</v>

138
00:06:44.151 --> 00:06:44.984
<v Speaker 1>The first verb is in second position,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the next verb comes at the end of </v>

139
00:06:47.871 --> 00:06:49.220
<v Speaker 1>the sentence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nouns,</v>

140
00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:51.230
<v Speaker 1>gender,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when it comes to gender,</v>

141
00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:53.840
<v Speaker 1>dutch traditionally has three genders,</v>
<v Speaker 1>masculine,</v>

142
00:06:53.841 --> 00:06:56.300
<v Speaker 1>feminine and neuter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But in modern spoken dutch,</v>

143
00:06:56.330 --> 00:06:58.250
<v Speaker 1>the distinction between masculine and </v>
<v Speaker 1>feminine,</v>

144
00:06:58.251 --> 00:06:59.084
<v Speaker 1>gender has almost become irrelevant </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they don't look or sound </v>

145
00:07:01.461 --> 00:07:03.860
<v Speaker 1>different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It used to determine which pronoun would</v>

146
00:07:03.861 --> 00:07:06.980
<v Speaker 1>be used to refer to those nouns,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's he or she,</v>

147
00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:09.230
<v Speaker 1>but people generally just use he these </v>
<v Speaker 1>days.</v>

148
00:07:09.350 --> 00:07:11.420
<v Speaker 1>So now the two genders are basically </v>
<v Speaker 1>common.</v>

149
00:07:11.421 --> 00:07:12.254
<v Speaker 1>Gender and neuter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the announced gender agrees with </v>

150
00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:16.640
<v Speaker 1>articles as well as the forms of </v>
<v Speaker 1>adjectives,</v>

151
00:07:17.090 --> 00:07:19.550
<v Speaker 1>plural.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are two types of neural endings in</v>

152
00:07:19.551 --> 00:07:21.070
<v Speaker 1>dutch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one is n,</v>

153
00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:23.330
<v Speaker 1>and the other is yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are some,</v>

154
00:07:23.510 --> 00:07:26.210
<v Speaker 1>well not rules but patterns for when to </v>
<v Speaker 1>use each one,</v>

155
00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:27.073
<v Speaker 1>but there are a lot of exceptions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you have words like douche dude and </v>

156
00:07:31.250 --> 00:07:36.250
<v Speaker 1>votes bulletin and you have words like </v>
<v Speaker 1>just little doodles,</v>

157
00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:40.790
<v Speaker 1>the labels,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a few neuter nouns have a plural form.</v>

158
00:07:40.990 --> 00:07:42.170
<v Speaker 1>Irwin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

159
00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:47.930
<v Speaker 1>cases dutch used to have now in cases </v>
<v Speaker 1>similar to german,</v>

160
00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:49.670
<v Speaker 1>there were four cases,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nominative,</v>

161
00:07:49.700 --> 00:07:51.410
<v Speaker 1>genitive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dative and accusative.</v>

162
00:07:51.530 --> 00:07:54.320
<v Speaker 1>These were part of standard written </v>
<v Speaker 1>dutch until the 19 forties,</v>

163
00:07:54.321 --> 00:07:57.020
<v Speaker 1>but they were dropped because nobody </v>
<v Speaker 1>used them in speech anymore.</v>

164
00:08:00.980 --> 00:08:03.050
<v Speaker 1>There are several different articles in </v>
<v Speaker 1>dutch.</v>

165
00:08:03.110 --> 00:08:07.190
<v Speaker 1>There is an indefinite article and and </v>
<v Speaker 1>there are definite articles for singular</v>

166
00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:11.690
<v Speaker 1>and plural nouns for singular masculine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the for singular feminine,</v>

167
00:08:12.010 --> 00:08:16.340
<v Speaker 1>the for singular neuter head and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>definite article for plural,</v>

168
00:08:16.370 --> 00:08:17.203
<v Speaker 1>for all genders.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The an interesting thing is there is a </v>

169
00:08:19.821 --> 00:08:23.780
<v Speaker 1>negative article came.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the same for all genders and for</v>

170
00:08:23.781 --> 00:08:24.614
<v Speaker 1>both singular and plural verbs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are two verb tenses in dutch past </v>

171
00:08:28.131 --> 00:08:31.340
<v Speaker 1>and present or non past,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but saying there are two tenses.</v>

172
00:08:31.341 --> 00:08:33.650
<v Speaker 1>Is kind of misleading because similar to</v>
<v Speaker 1>an english,</v>

173
00:08:33.651 --> 00:08:34.484
<v Speaker 1>the verb can be used in combination with</v>
<v Speaker 1>different auxiliary verbs to express </v>

174
00:08:37.461 --> 00:08:38.294
<v Speaker 1>different meanings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there are participle forms that can </v>

175
00:08:40.011 --> 00:08:42.430
<v Speaker 1>be used to show a passive or continuous </v>
<v Speaker 1>action.</v>

176
00:08:42.650 --> 00:08:43.483
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's a sentence using the simple past </v>

177
00:08:45.650 --> 00:08:50.650
<v Speaker 1>had about this means he built a house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we start with the infinitive bowen,</v>

178
00:08:51.350 --> 00:08:54.590
<v Speaker 1>and this is the verb stem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is the past tense form boda.</v>

179
00:08:55.490 --> 00:08:57.660
<v Speaker 1>Now here's a perfect sentence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Often,</v>

180
00:08:57.810 --> 00:09:00.630
<v Speaker 1>often boats,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this means he has built a house,</v>

181
00:09:00.810 --> 00:09:04.140
<v Speaker 1>so we start with the infinitive heaven </v>
<v Speaker 1>and here's the verb stem,</v>

182
00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:05.153
<v Speaker 1>and here's the past tense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the second verb is a past </v>

183
00:09:08.251 --> 00:09:09.084
<v Speaker 1>participle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is formed by adding the prefix and </v>

184
00:09:11.431 --> 00:09:14.430
<v Speaker 1>the suffix.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The notice again that the second verb is</v>

185
00:09:14.431 --> 00:09:15.264
<v Speaker 1>at the end of the sentence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though the first verb is in second </v>

186
00:09:17.491 --> 00:09:18.324
<v Speaker 1>position after the subject,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are three different ways to </v>

187
00:09:20.311 --> 00:09:21.144
<v Speaker 1>express the future tense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of them is to use this auxiliary </v>

188
00:09:23.370 --> 00:09:24.203
<v Speaker 1>verb.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This means something like shell or will </v>

189
00:09:26.770 --> 00:09:30.900
<v Speaker 1>he had more than this sentence means I </v>
<v Speaker 1>will do it tomorrow.</v>

190
00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:34.980
<v Speaker 1>You can also use this verb meaning to go</v>
<v Speaker 1>plus the infinitive.</v>

191
00:09:35.460 --> 00:09:37.710
<v Speaker 1>This is similar to using going to an </v>
<v Speaker 1>english,</v>

192
00:09:37.860 --> 00:09:39.630
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>headscarf and eighth,</v>

193
00:09:39.631 --> 00:09:40.464
<v Speaker 1>and then this means it's going to rain </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you can also use the present tense </v>

194
00:09:44.430 --> 00:09:46.800
<v Speaker 1>for the future xy coleman per slot.</v>

195
00:09:47.250 --> 00:09:51.240
<v Speaker 1>This means they won't come until later.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Literally they come only later,</v>

196
00:09:51.750 --> 00:09:55.440
<v Speaker 1>so the verb system in dutch is rather </v>
<v Speaker 1>similar to the one used in english.</v>

197
00:09:55.441 --> 00:09:56.274
<v Speaker 1>The main difference being that any verb </v>
<v Speaker 1>after the first one comes at the end </v>

198
00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:00.473
<v Speaker 1>pronunciation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the hardest parts of learning </v>

199
00:10:01.801 --> 00:10:02.634
<v Speaker 1>dutch might be the pronunciation because</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are some sounds that can be a </v>

200
00:10:05.311 --> 00:10:06.144
<v Speaker 1>challenge for learners and native </v>
<v Speaker 1>speakers of dutch seem quite conscious </v>

201
00:10:08.671 --> 00:10:09.504
<v Speaker 1>of the challenges we face.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was kind of an indirect way of </v>

202
00:10:11.401 --> 00:10:13.410
<v Speaker 1>saying they think our pronunciation </v>
<v Speaker 1>sucks.</v>

203
00:10:13.470 --> 00:10:17.130
<v Speaker 1>Some of the sounds that require special </v>
<v Speaker 1>effort are the dutch g sound,</v>

204
00:10:17.250 --> 00:10:21.390
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the sound which ch often represents.</v>

205
00:10:21.420 --> 00:10:22.253
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>notice that this is the same sound as </v>

206
00:10:24.751 --> 00:10:27.960
<v Speaker 1>the one represented by ge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in other cases,</v>

207
00:10:27.961 --> 00:10:30.330
<v Speaker 1>ch represents the ship sound.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

208
00:10:30.331 --> 00:10:32.460
<v Speaker 1>sometimes those sounds come at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>beginning of a word,</v>

209
00:10:32.490 --> 00:10:33.323
<v Speaker 1>which is a little bit of a challenge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but sometimes they come right after the </v>

210
00:10:35.551 --> 00:10:38.430
<v Speaker 1>letter s like in the word for school </v>
<v Speaker 1>skol.</v>

211
00:10:38.910 --> 00:10:40.980
<v Speaker 1>The sound combination is quite common in</v>
<v Speaker 1>dutch.</v>

212
00:10:41.070 --> 00:10:41.903
<v Speaker 1>There are a lot of long words in dutch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some of them can be over 30 characters </v>

213
00:10:45.031 --> 00:10:47.250
<v Speaker 1>long.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here are a couple of extreme examples.</v>

214
00:10:47.370 --> 00:10:49.470
<v Speaker 1>Myhrvold persona,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the kite store,</v>

215
00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:50.313
<v Speaker 1>nice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This one means multiple personality </v>

216
00:10:51.991 --> 00:10:55.690
<v Speaker 1>disorder and that is 35 characters long </v>
<v Speaker 1>through it,</v>

217
00:10:55.880 --> 00:10:56.713
<v Speaker 1>but adding reading some hayden plum.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This one means preparation activities </v>

218
00:10:59.581 --> 00:11:04.230
<v Speaker 1>for our children's carnival procession </v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is 53 characters long and dutch</v>

219
00:11:04.231 --> 00:11:06.960
<v Speaker 1>also has a lot of colorful idioms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

220
00:11:07.020 --> 00:11:10.290
<v Speaker 1>mocked up the guts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This means make the cat wires.</v>

221
00:11:10.500 --> 00:11:11.333
<v Speaker 1>This means that someone is saying </v>
<v Speaker 1>something so outlandish or unbelievable </v>

222
00:11:13.981 --> 00:11:17.400
<v Speaker 1>that even the cat won't believe it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Another example of houston,</v>

223
00:11:17.410 --> 00:11:20.550
<v Speaker 1>but indicator,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this means he has a beard in his throat.</v>

224
00:11:20.790 --> 00:11:25.080
<v Speaker 1>This idiom describes a situation when a </v>
<v Speaker 1>boy reaches puberty and his voice starts</v>

225
00:11:25.081 --> 00:11:25.914
<v Speaker 1>to change.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How hard is dutch to learn for english </v>

226
00:11:27.751 --> 00:11:28.110
<v Speaker 1>speakers?</v>

227
00:11:28.110 --> 00:11:31.230
<v Speaker 1>A lot of dutch will seem strangely </v>
<v Speaker 1>familiar and of course that will help,</v>

228
00:11:31.231 --> 00:11:32.064
<v Speaker 1>but there are some issues and learning </v>
<v Speaker 1>the pronunciation as well as the finer </v>

229
00:11:34.531 --> 00:11:35.364
<v Speaker 1>details of grammar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but maybe the hardest thing about </v>

230
00:11:37.291 --> 00:11:40.860
<v Speaker 1>learning dutch is that dutch speakers </v>
<v Speaker 1>usually speak english very well,</v>

231
00:11:40.861 --> 00:11:43.920
<v Speaker 1>so it will be hard to practice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you try to speak dutch with people,</v>

232
00:11:44.010 --> 00:11:47.760
<v Speaker 1>they'll probably answer you in english,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can solve that problem by taking</v>

233
00:11:47.761 --> 00:11:48.594
<v Speaker 1>some lessons or doing a language </v>
<v Speaker 1>exchange and practicing on your own </v>

234
00:11:50.851 --> 00:11:53.770
<v Speaker 1>until you reach a fairly good level and </v>
<v Speaker 1>have a fairly good base.</v>

235
00:11:53.800 --> 00:11:56.380
<v Speaker 1>Then after that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can speak to people in dutch without</v>

236
00:11:56.410 --> 00:11:57.580
<v Speaker 1>totally pissing them off.</v>

237
00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:02.740
<v Speaker 1>The question of the day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For native speakers of dutch,</v>

238
00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:06.580

<v Speaker 1>to dutch languages like frisian or low </v>
<v Speaker 1>saxon,</v>

240
00:12:09.550 --> 00:12:10.383
<v Speaker 1>and for people who have studied dutch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what was your experience with trying to </v>

<v Speaker 1>learn and practice dutch?</v>

<v Speaker 1>What was the best way for you to learn </v>
