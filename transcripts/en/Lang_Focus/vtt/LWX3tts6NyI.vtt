<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2
00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:12.840
<v Speaker 2>good evening and welcome to the Lange </v>
<v Speaker 2>focus channel.</v>

3
00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.860
<v Speaker 2>This is a quick video to bring you some </v>
<v Speaker 2>breaking news from the linguistic world.</v>

4
00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.200
<v Speaker 2>According to recently released </v>
<v Speaker 2>documents,</v>

5
00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:20.063
<v Speaker 2>the European Union will soon be adopting</v>
<v Speaker 2>Esperanto as an official language for </v>

6
00:00:24.001 --> 00:00:27.180
<v Speaker 2>those who don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Esperanto is a constructed language that</v>

7
00:00:27.181 --> 00:00:30.860
<v Speaker 2>was created in the 18 slash 17 by Dr ll </v>
<v Speaker 2>Zimmerman Hoff.</v>

8
00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:35.670
<v Speaker 2>It was created in order to function as </v>
<v Speaker 2>an international auxiliary language that</v>

9
00:00:35.671 --> 00:00:36.504
<v Speaker 2>people all around the world can learn </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it was intentionally designed to be </v>

10
00:00:39.361 --> 00:00:40.194
<v Speaker 2>extremely easy to learn,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but Esperanto never fully caught on and </v>

11
00:00:42.871 --> 00:00:45.240
<v Speaker 2>remained mostly a hobby for language </v>
<v Speaker 2>nerds.</v>

12
00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:47.550
<v Speaker 2>Until now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>According to EU officials,</v>

13
00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:48.443
<v Speaker 2>Esperanto will be designated the 25th </v>
<v Speaker 2>official language of the European Union </v>

14
00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:53.033
<v Speaker 2>and will function as a working language </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the European Parliament as well as a </v>

15
00:00:56.221 --> 00:00:59.880
<v Speaker 2>procedural language of the European </v>
<v Speaker 2>Commission in addition to English,</v>

16
00:00:59.881 --> 00:01:00.780
<v Speaker 2>French,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and German.</v>

17
00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:01.823
<v Speaker 2>The EU is also expected to soon </v>
<v Speaker 2>recommend that all member states begin </v>

18
00:01:05.041 --> 00:01:08.970
<v Speaker 2>drafting plans for public school </v>
<v Speaker 2>educational programs in Esperanto.</v>

19
00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:09.923
<v Speaker 2>The unofficial word on the street is </v>
<v Speaker 2>that with the coming departure of the </v>

20
00:01:12.481 --> 00:01:14.250
<v Speaker 2>UK,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from the European Union,</v>

21
00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:15.173
<v Speaker 2>enthusiasm for learning English is </v>
<v Speaker 2>declining and Esperanto is a viable </v>

22
00:01:18.871 --> 00:01:22.530
<v Speaker 2>longterm option to replace English as </v>
<v Speaker 2>the international language.</v>

23
00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.680
<v Speaker 2>This new European Union policy will </v>
<v Speaker 2>begin on April 30,</v>
