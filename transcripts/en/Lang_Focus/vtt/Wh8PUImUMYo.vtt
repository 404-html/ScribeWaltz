00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:03.010
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>

2
00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:19.453
<v Speaker 2>Hello everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Welcome to the Lange Focus Channel and </v>

3
00:00:21.801 --> 00:00:22.634
<v Speaker 2>my name is Paul.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Today's topic is the Hungarian language </v>

4
00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:29.960
<v Speaker 2>or my job and he has,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as it's called in Hungarian.</v>

5
00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:33.500
<v Speaker 2>Hungarian is not just another European </v>
<v Speaker 2>language.</v>

6
00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:36.050
<v Speaker 2>There's nothing else quite like it for </v>
<v Speaker 2>starters,</v>

7
00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.913
<v Speaker 2>it's not an Indo European language.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when you look at a map and see that </v>

8
00:00:40.551 --> 00:00:44.960
<v Speaker 2>Europe's Hungarian speaking areas are </v>
<v Speaker 2>surrounded by Indo European languages,</v>

9
00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:48.170
<v Speaker 2>you have to ask yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how did Hungarian get there?</v>

10
00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:51.710
<v Speaker 2>Most Hungarian speakers live in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>carpathian basin,</v>

11
00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:54.440
<v Speaker 2>bordered by the Carpathian mountains to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the north,</v>

12
00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:58.100
<v Speaker 2>east and south.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That includes not only around 10 million</v>

13
00:00:58.101 --> 00:00:58.934
<v Speaker 2>speakers in Hungary,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but also in areas of the basin in </v>

14
00:01:01.701 --> 00:01:03.980
<v Speaker 2>neighboring countries,</v>
<v Speaker 2>including Romania,</v>

15
00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:05.690
<v Speaker 2>Serbia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Croatia,</v>

16
00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:07.610
<v Speaker 2>Slovenia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Austria,</v>

17
00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:09.380
<v Speaker 2>Slovakia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and Ukraine.</v>

18
00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:10.483
<v Speaker 2>The largest Hungarian speaking minority </v>
<v Speaker 2>is in northwestern and central Romania </v>

19
00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:15.463
<v Speaker 2>were around 1.2</v>
<v Speaker 2>million people speak at or around 6% of </v>

20
00:01:18.951 --> 00:01:20.180
<v Speaker 2>the country's population.</v>

21
00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:23.510
<v Speaker 2>All of these Hungarian areas in the car </v>
<v Speaker 2>pay the invasives.</v>

22
00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:24.373
<v Speaker 2>We're part of the Kingdom of Hungary </v>
<v Speaker 2>until 1920 when many areas were seated </v>

23
00:01:28.221 --> 00:01:29.054
<v Speaker 2>to other countries.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But how did they get there in the first </v>

24
00:01:31.041 --> 00:01:31.874
<v Speaker 2>place?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hungarian is a member of the eugric </v>

25
00:01:33.951 --> 00:01:34.784
<v Speaker 2>branch of the urologic language family,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which originated in the vicinity of the </v>

26
00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:40.033
<v Speaker 2>Ural Mountains,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which separate Europe from western </v>

27
00:01:41.091 --> 00:01:41.924
<v Speaker 2>Siberia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The urologic languages include two main </v>

28
00:01:44.181 --> 00:01:45.950
<v Speaker 2>groupings,</v>
<v Speaker 2>semiotic,</v>

29
00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:46.903
<v Speaker 2>which was the first group to branch off </v>
<v Speaker 2>from your Alec and Pheno eugric around </v>

30
00:01:50.571 --> 00:01:55.520
<v Speaker 2>2000 bce or maybe earlier Finnell eugric</v>
<v Speaker 2>split into protal Eugric,</v>

31
00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:58.730
<v Speaker 2>the ancestor of the eugric branch,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and Prodo Finnick,</v>

32
00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:02.480
<v Speaker 2>the ancestor of the Finnick languages,</v>
<v Speaker 2>including finish and Astonian.</v>

33
00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:03.583
<v Speaker 2>Prodo eugric remained a unified language</v>
<v Speaker 2>for more than a millennium until </v>

34
00:02:06.891 --> 00:02:10.160
<v Speaker 2>Hungarian diverged from it around 800 </v>
<v Speaker 2>bce.</v>

35
00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:13.430
<v Speaker 2>There's some debate about whether the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Hungarian ethnic group,</v>

36
00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:16.370
<v Speaker 2>the man jars,</v>
<v Speaker 2>originated to the west or to the east of</v>

37
00:02:16.371 --> 00:02:17.360
<v Speaker 2>the euro mountains.</v>

38
00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:18.313
<v Speaker 2>But at some point around 2000 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they became nomadic in response to </v>

39
00:02:21.711 --> 00:02:22.544
<v Speaker 2>changes in climate and landscape,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and began gradually migrating towards </v>

40
00:02:25.701 --> 00:02:28.610
<v Speaker 2>the West,</v>
<v Speaker 2>eventually reaching the Carpathian basin</v>

41
00:02:28.611 --> 00:02:29.444
<v Speaker 2>in the ninth century,</v>
<v Speaker 2>both while settled near the Ural </v>

42
00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:34.330
<v Speaker 2>Mountains and while migrating west,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the madge,</v>

43
00:02:34.331 --> 00:02:37.100
<v Speaker 2>ours had extensive contact with Turkic </v>
<v Speaker 2>peoples.</v>

44
00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:38.113
<v Speaker 2>For instance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the my jars formed part of a tribal </v>

45
00:02:40.161 --> 00:02:44.390
<v Speaker 2>alliance with Turkic tribes called on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No good meaning 10 tribes,</v>

46
00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:46.880
<v Speaker 2>which was based in the northern Black </v>
<v Speaker 2>Sea area.</v>

47
00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:47.900
<v Speaker 2>This,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>

48
00:02:47.901 --> 00:02:52.610
<v Speaker 2>is the most likely origin of the term </v>
<v Speaker 2>Hungarian and it's equivalent Udon Gotti</v>

49
00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:53.503
<v Speaker 2>and Latin uhmm [inaudible] in Greek and </v>
<v Speaker 2>own Goodie in Podo Slavic after the </v>

50
00:02:58.311 --> 00:03:02.340
<v Speaker 2>owner Guler alliance disintegrated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they became part of the cozaar connate,</v>

51
00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:03.413
<v Speaker 2>a Turkic Empire covering much of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Caucasus region and the Black Sea area </v>

52
00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:07.953
<v Speaker 2>for a time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They collected taxes from Slavic people </v>

53
00:03:09.941 --> 00:03:10.774
<v Speaker 2>on behalf of the Kossar's until they </v>
<v Speaker 2>became politically independent from the </v>

54
00:03:13.631 --> 00:03:14.464
<v Speaker 2>Kossar's in the year eight 30 this </v>
<v Speaker 2>interaction with Turkic tribes and </v>

55
00:03:17.741 --> 00:03:18.574
<v Speaker 2>political entities led to significant </v>
<v Speaker 2>Turkic influence on the Hungarian </v>

56
00:03:21.851 --> 00:03:22.684
<v Speaker 2>language.</v>

57
00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:23.613
<v Speaker 2>It's hard to give an exact count of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>number of Turkic loan words in </v>

58
00:03:26.351 --> 00:03:27.184
<v Speaker 2>Hungarian,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but this lexicon contains around 500 </v>

59
00:03:29.651 --> 00:03:31.840
<v Speaker 2>loan words from old Turkic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Also,</v>

60
00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:35.590
<v Speaker 2>the old Hungarian script developed from </v>
<v Speaker 2>the [inaudible] script,</v>

61
00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:40.650
<v Speaker 2>the Turkic runic script that was used by</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Kossar's in the ninth century.</v>

62
00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:41.643
<v Speaker 2>The majora's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're carrying out frequent raids in </v>

63
00:03:43.421 --> 00:03:44.254
<v Speaker 2>Europe and in the year 896 they crossed </v>
<v Speaker 2>the Carpathian mountains under the </v>

64
00:03:48.101 --> 00:03:48.934
<v Speaker 2>leadership of outer pod and began </v>
<v Speaker 2>settling in the Carpathian basin by the </v>

65
00:03:53.231 --> 00:03:54.400
<v Speaker 2>year 1000,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

66
00:03:54.401 --> 00:03:57.370
<v Speaker 2>Christian kingdom was established under </v>
<v Speaker 2>King Stephen.</v>

67
00:03:57.371 --> 00:04:01.990
<v Speaker 2>The first under him Hungarian began to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be written in the Latin Alphabet,</v>

68
00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:02.913
<v Speaker 2>but for some time the old Hungarian </v>
<v Speaker 2>script was used as well for vernacular </v>

69
00:04:06.461 --> 00:04:07.294
<v Speaker 2>writing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was used by the [inaudible] until at </v>

70
00:04:09.851 --> 00:04:13.540
<v Speaker 2>least the 17th century and since the </v>
<v Speaker 2>early 20th century,</v>

71
00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:18.100
<v Speaker 2>it has undergone a revival to some </v>
<v Speaker 2>extent with limited use for symbolic and</v>

72
00:04:18.101 --> 00:04:19.150
<v Speaker 2>cultural reasons.</v>

73
00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:23.380
<v Speaker 2>Stephen the first also med Latin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the sole official language of Hungary.</v>

74
00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:25.810
<v Speaker 2>And it remains so until the 19th </v>
<v Speaker 2>century,</v>

75
00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:27.663
<v Speaker 2>the old Hungarian period,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the old Hungarian period conventionally </v>

76
00:04:31.091 --> 00:04:33.850
<v Speaker 2>begins with the settlement of the car </v>
<v Speaker 2>pay the invasive.</v>

77
00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:37.660
<v Speaker 2>This is around the time of the earliest </v>
<v Speaker 2>fragments of written Hungarian,</v>

78
00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:41.890
<v Speaker 2>which date back to the 10th century and </v>
<v Speaker 2>a written than the old Hungarian script.</v>

79
00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:46.420
<v Speaker 2>Isolated words written in the Latin </v>
<v Speaker 2>alphabet can be found dating back to the</v>

80
00:04:46.421 --> 00:04:47.254
<v Speaker 2>mid 11th century.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the oldest extensive texts is from </v>

81
00:04:50.711 --> 00:04:51.544
<v Speaker 2>1192 the late 12th century.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hungarian has changed relatively little </v>

82
00:04:55.901 --> 00:04:56.734
<v Speaker 2>since the old Hungarian period,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but due to contact with other languages </v>

83
00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:00.753
<v Speaker 2>and the assimilation of other tribes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it has absorbed words from a variety of </v>

84
00:05:04.301 --> 00:05:05.134
<v Speaker 2>languages,</v>
<v Speaker 2>including German and the erotic and </v>

85
00:05:07.241 --> 00:05:08.074
<v Speaker 2>Slavic languages as well as Latin and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the Turkic languages we've already </v>

86
00:05:11.171 --> 00:05:13.390
<v Speaker 2>discussed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Middle Hungarian,</v>

87
00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:14.793
<v Speaker 2>the Middle Hungarian period began with </v>
<v Speaker 2>the printing of the first books in </v>

88
00:05:17.741 --> 00:05:18.574
<v Speaker 2>Hungarian.</v>

89
00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:19.953
<v Speaker 2>During much of this period,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Ottoman occupation of central and </v>

90
00:05:22.571 --> 00:05:23.404
<v Speaker 2>southern Hungary took place and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Habsburg empire ruled the northern and </v>

91
00:05:26.591 --> 00:05:27.424
<v Speaker 2>northwestern areas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which likely brought some additional </v>

92
00:05:29.381 --> 00:05:30.214
<v Speaker 2>Turkic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>specifically Turkish and dramatic </v>

93
00:05:31.991 --> 00:05:34.930
<v Speaker 2>influences to the language modern </v>
<v Speaker 2>Hungarian.</v>

94
00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:39.580
<v Speaker 2>In the 18th and 19th centuries,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hungarian underwent a language reform in</v>

95
00:05:39.581 --> 00:05:40.414
<v Speaker 2>order to standardize it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to make it more suitable for literature </v>

96
00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:44.920
<v Speaker 2>and to make it more suitable for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>sciences.</v>

97
00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:46.083
<v Speaker 2>They revived old vocabulary,</v>
<v Speaker 2>used existing routes and fx station to </v>

98
00:05:49.481 --> 00:05:50.314
<v Speaker 2>create new words and introduced some </v>
<v Speaker 2>dialectal words on a national level in </v>

99
00:05:53.951 --> 00:05:54.784
<v Speaker 2>order to expand the vocabulary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In 1836 it became the official language </v>

100
00:05:59.150 --> 00:05:59.983
<v Speaker 2>alongside Latin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and in 1844 it became the sole official </v>

101
00:06:03.201 --> 00:06:08.180
<v Speaker 2>language of Hungary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>From 1867 to 1918 the kingdom of Hungary</v>

102
00:06:08.181 --> 00:06:10.430
<v Speaker 2>was part of the Union of Austria,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hungary.</v>

103
00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:11.743
<v Speaker 2>In 1920 after Austria,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hungary is involvement in the first </v>

104
00:06:14.421 --> 00:06:15.200
<v Speaker 2>world war.</v>

105
00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:16.033
<v Speaker 2>The treaty of Triano redrew the borders </v>
<v Speaker 2>of Hungary and assigned many of its </v>

106
00:06:19.341 --> 00:06:20.174
<v Speaker 2>areas to neighboring countries based on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the ethnic composition of their </v>

107
00:06:23.001 --> 00:06:23.834
<v Speaker 2>populations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This resulted in the current situation </v>

108
00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:27.013
<v Speaker 2>in which millions of Hungarian speakers </v>
<v Speaker 2>live outside of Hungary in neighboring </v>

109
00:06:30.111 --> 00:06:30.944
<v Speaker 2>countries,</v>
<v Speaker 2>despite the fact that Hungarian has </v>

110
00:06:32.991 --> 00:06:36.140
<v Speaker 2>ancient connections to other urologic </v>
<v Speaker 2>languages today,</v>

111
00:06:36.141 --> 00:06:39.110
<v Speaker 2>it's similarities to them are not </v>
<v Speaker 2>immediately obvious,</v>

112
00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:43.490
<v Speaker 2>and despite the fact that Hungarian </v>
<v Speaker 2>vocabulary has been widely influenced by</v>

113
00:06:43.491 --> 00:06:44.324
<v Speaker 2>other languages,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the borrowed words are mostly older </v>

114
00:06:46.551 --> 00:06:49.970
<v Speaker 2>words that are further obscured through </v>
<v Speaker 2>compounding and affixation.</v>

115
00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:52.490
<v Speaker 2>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the word Goomba,</v>

116
00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:53.533
<v Speaker 2>meaning mushroom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This was borrowed from old slavonic </v>

117
00:06:55.970 --> 00:06:57.860
<v Speaker 2>Goomba.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In modern Bulgarian,</v>

118
00:06:57.890 --> 00:07:01.640
<v Speaker 2>it's Guba and in Super Mario brothers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's Goomba.</v>

119
00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:08.390
<v Speaker 2>But this word can also form a compound </v>
<v Speaker 2>word with this word here,</v>

120
00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:09.253
<v Speaker 2>Sienna meaning species.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Goma Fayetta means fungus to make it </v>

121
00:07:13.161 --> 00:07:15.890
<v Speaker 2>plural.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We add a k Goma ferric.</v>

122
00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:19.090
<v Speaker 2>Then there might be a case ending gum </v>
<v Speaker 2>buffet cat.</v>

123
00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:22.130
<v Speaker 2>Now what's in the accusative case?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You may be thinking,</v>

124
00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:22.993
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that beginning part is still </v>

125
00:07:23.751 --> 00:07:26.330
<v Speaker 2>recognizable to speakers of Bulgarian.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

126
00:07:26.331 --> 00:07:28.580
<v Speaker 2>maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But in other Slavic languages,</v>

127
00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:29.473
<v Speaker 2>that route is not so commonly used </v>
<v Speaker 2>anymore or has changed more than it has </v>

128
00:07:32.631 --> 00:07:34.610
<v Speaker 2>in Bulgarian.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like in Slovak.</v>

129
00:07:34.910 --> 00:07:35.743
<v Speaker 2>It's who the main point I'm getting at </v>
<v Speaker 2>is that a lot of the loan words in </v>

130
00:07:39.231 --> 00:07:41.570
<v Speaker 2>Hungarian or not immediately </v>
<v Speaker 2>recognizable,</v>

131
00:07:41.810 --> 00:07:42.643
<v Speaker 2>but anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that brings us to the most important </v>

132
00:07:43.941 --> 00:07:45.500
<v Speaker 2>question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's Hungarian?</v>

133
00:07:45.501 --> 00:07:46.334
<v Speaker 2>Like?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hungarian is an a gluten native </v>

134
00:07:47.811 --> 00:07:48.644
<v Speaker 2>language,</v>
<v Speaker 2>meaning that words are made up of a </v>

135
00:07:50.151 --> 00:07:50.984
<v Speaker 2>linear sequence of morphemes that each </v>
<v Speaker 2>contribute a piece of meaning to the </v>

136
00:07:54.081 --> 00:07:54.710
<v Speaker 2>word.</v>

137
00:07:54.710 --> 00:07:57.920
<v Speaker 2>So let's start with this word.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Vital meaning city.</v>

138
00:07:58.130 --> 00:08:00.830
<v Speaker 2>For the plural,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we add oh vital,</v>

139
00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:04.100
<v Speaker 2>she'll meaning cities and for words </v>
<v Speaker 2>ending in a vowel,</v>

140
00:08:04.101 --> 00:08:06.620
<v Speaker 2>you just add.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For the first person,</v>

141
00:08:06.621 --> 00:08:10.110
<v Speaker 2>singular possessive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We add boom of auto show,</v>

142
00:08:10.370 --> 00:08:11.203
<v Speaker 2>meaning my city.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now let's make it a location of </v>

143
00:08:13.790 --> 00:08:16.730
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] means in my city.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This here,</v>

144
00:08:16.731 --> 00:08:18.620
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was the definite article,</v>

145
00:08:18.710 --> 00:08:19.543
<v Speaker 2>which we'll look at a little later.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you can see how we start with the </v>

146
00:08:22.371 --> 00:08:25.130
<v Speaker 2>root word and add suffixes to it to add </v>
<v Speaker 2>meaning,</v>

147
00:08:25.370 --> 00:08:28.010
<v Speaker 2>but the suffixes are not always exactly </v>
<v Speaker 2>the same.</v>

148
00:08:28.190 --> 00:08:32.150
<v Speaker 2>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jeb meaning pocket for this word,</v>

149
00:08:32.151 --> 00:08:32.984
<v Speaker 2>the plural would be Jeff Beck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My pocket [inaudible] my pockets in the </v>

150
00:08:37.521 --> 00:08:38.354
<v Speaker 2>plural [inaudible] in my pocket.</v>
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] them in my pockets or </v>

151
00:08:43.011 --> 00:08:43.910
<v Speaker 2>champagne,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ben.</v>

152
00:08:44.570 --> 00:08:45.403
<v Speaker 2>So what's up with all the ease instead </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the oes and the a is we saw in the </v>

153
00:08:48.621 --> 00:08:49.760
<v Speaker 2>first word,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

154
00:08:49.790 --> 00:08:52.520
<v Speaker 2>Hungarian features something called </v>
<v Speaker 2>vowel harmony.</v>

155
00:08:52.850 --> 00:08:53.683
<v Speaker 2>This means that the vowels which appear </v>
<v Speaker 2>and suffixes depend on the vowel in the </v>

156
00:08:56.821 --> 00:09:00.750
<v Speaker 2>final syllable of the word.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the suffix is in the first example.</v>

157
00:09:00.780 --> 00:09:03.630
<v Speaker 2>Vitals are in harmony with the vowel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

158
00:09:03.980 --> 00:09:08.490
<v Speaker 2>and the suffix is in the second example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jeb are in harmony with the vowel e.</v>

159
00:09:09.030 --> 00:09:12.090
<v Speaker 2>The exact value used also depends on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>type of suffix.</v>

160
00:09:13.050 --> 00:09:13.883
<v Speaker 2>We can also see vowel harmony and a </v>
<v Speaker 2>gluten nation in Hungarians verb </v>

161
00:09:16.951 --> 00:09:17.784
<v Speaker 2>conjugations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The base form of the verb meaning to </v>

162
00:09:19.951 --> 00:09:20.784
<v Speaker 2>write is ead for regular verbs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These verb endings here are added to </v>

163
00:09:24.871 --> 00:09:27.990
<v Speaker 2>verbs with one of the following vowels </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the final syllable.</v>

164
00:09:28.470 --> 00:09:32.730
<v Speaker 2>The base form of the verb,</v>
<v Speaker 2>meaning to drive or to lead is visit.</v>

165
00:09:33.090 --> 00:09:33.923
<v Speaker 2>These verb endings here are added to </v>
<v Speaker 2>verbs with one of the following vowels </v>

166
00:09:36.811 --> 00:09:40.080
<v Speaker 2>in the final syllable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>either shorts he or long Ie.</v>

167
00:09:40.470 --> 00:09:45.470
<v Speaker 2>The base form of the verb meaning to sit</v>
<v Speaker 2>is these endings right here are added to</v>

168
00:09:45.751 --> 00:09:48.450
<v Speaker 2>verbs with any of these vowels in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>last syllable,</v>

169
00:09:48.690 --> 00:09:49.523
<v Speaker 2>but there's more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These conjugations you see here are </v>

170
00:09:52.141 --> 00:09:53.820
<v Speaker 2>indefinite conjugations.</v>

171
00:09:55.890 --> 00:09:56.723
<v Speaker 2>Transitive verbs in Hungarian have </v>
<v Speaker 2>different conjugations depending on </v>

172
00:09:59.521 --> 00:10:02.160
<v Speaker 2>whether the object is definite or </v>
<v Speaker 2>indefinite.</v>

173
00:10:02.580 --> 00:10:03.413
<v Speaker 2>Let's take the verb to write in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Edo means I write or just eeoc because </v>

174
00:10:08.761 --> 00:10:09.594
<v Speaker 2>Hungarian is pro drop,</v>
<v Speaker 2>meaning the subject pronouns can be </v>

175
00:10:12.151 --> 00:10:13.950
<v Speaker 2>dropped.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Edo Call Amit,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I write the book is a definite article </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you dome is the definite </v>

179
00:10:29.761 --> 00:10:30.594
<v Speaker 2>conjugation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hungarian verbs also have past tense </v>

180
00:10:33.631 --> 00:10:34.464
<v Speaker 2>forms,</v>
<v Speaker 2>both definite and indefinite ones with </v>

181
00:10:37.201 --> 00:10:38.034
<v Speaker 2>almost no exceptions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There is no separate form for future </v>

182
00:10:40.471 --> 00:10:41.304
<v Speaker 2>tense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the future can be expressed using </v>

183
00:10:43.321 --> 00:10:47.160
<v Speaker 2>the infinitive of a verb plus the </v>
<v Speaker 2>present tense of the verb folk knee.</v>

184
00:10:47.550 --> 00:10:48.383
<v Speaker 2>So I will write a book is evening,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we'll catch you Yvette and I will </v>

185
00:10:52.171 --> 00:10:54.980

<v Speaker 2>the book is [inaudible].</v>

186
00:10:56.190 --> 00:10:59.700
<v Speaker 2>There are also numerous prefixes which </v>
<v Speaker 2>can be added to verbs,</v>

187
00:10:59.820 --> 00:11:00.653
<v Speaker 2>some of which add a new shade of meaning</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the verb and others which completely </v>

188
00:11:03.691 --> 00:11:06.750
<v Speaker 2>changed the meaning of the verb before </v>
<v Speaker 2>we saw the verb,</v>

189
00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:11.280
<v Speaker 2>which means to sit as in you are </v>
<v Speaker 2>currently in a seated position.</v>

<v Speaker 2>If you want to express the meaning of </v>
<v Speaker 2>sit as in sit down,</v>

191
00:11:14.850 --> 00:11:19.850
<v Speaker 2>you add the prefix net load and it can </v>
<v Speaker 2>also mean to serve like in this phrase,</v>

192
00:11:20.881 --> 00:11:25.881

<v Speaker 2>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to stop slouching.</v>

194
00:11:28.170 --> 00:11:29.003
<v Speaker 2>You say fed who bevel means sit in </v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes used for getting into a car </v>

195
00:11:34.680 --> 00:11:39.180
<v Speaker 2>and Lou means to sit still or to sit </v>
<v Speaker 2>away from the prefix.</v>

196
00:11:39.250 --> 00:11:40.083
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] means away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This word also means blow over or </v>

197
00:11:43.471 --> 00:11:47.130
<v Speaker 2>subside.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And before we saw the verb visit,</v>

198
00:11:47.370 --> 00:11:51.540
<v Speaker 2>meaning drive or lead,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it also means to conduct electricity</v>

199
00:11:51.780 --> 00:11:52.613
<v Speaker 2>live as that means drive down like from </v>
<v Speaker 2>a hill or from the capitol to the </v>

200
00:11:56.651 --> 00:11:57.484
<v Speaker 2>countryside.</v>

201
00:11:57.640 --> 00:12:02.200
<v Speaker 2>But it also means deduce bev as it means</v>
<v Speaker 2>to drive into.</v>

202
00:12:02.380 --> 00:12:03.213
<v Speaker 2>And it also means introduce,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in other words to put into practice fan </v>

203
00:12:06.821 --> 00:12:11.821

<v Speaker 2>And there are numerous more the way that</v>

204
00:12:11.921 --> 00:12:12.754
<v Speaker 2>these prefixes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ultra or the meanings of words is not </v>

205
00:12:14.471 --> 00:12:17.470
<v Speaker 2>always consistent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you can't always just put two and two</v>

206
00:12:17.471 --> 00:12:19.270
<v Speaker 2>together,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but sometimes that works.</v>

207
00:12:19.990 --> 00:12:20.823
<v Speaker 2>There are also a couple of types of </v>
<v Speaker 2>suffixes that can be attached to the </v>

208
00:12:23.171 --> 00:12:24.004
<v Speaker 2>verb to change its meaning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but at depending on vowel harmony or </v>

209
00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:31.960
<v Speaker 2>that that show causation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For example,</v>

210
00:12:32.020 --> 00:12:32.853
<v Speaker 2>visit means drive or lead visit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That means make someone drive and after </v>

211
00:12:37.871 --> 00:12:40.220
<v Speaker 2>that you can add verb endings to </v>
<v Speaker 2>conjugate it,</v>

212
00:12:40.390 --> 00:12:41.223
<v Speaker 2>like visit the drink.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We make someone drive and that's the </v>

213
00:12:44.801 --> 00:12:46.270
<v Speaker 2>indefinite form.</v>
<v Speaker 2>By the way,</v>

214
00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:51.130
<v Speaker 2>visit that Duke is the definite form </v>
<v Speaker 2>visit that you Daniella as,</v>

215
00:12:51.210 --> 00:12:54.670
<v Speaker 2>oh this means we make Daniel drive the </v>
<v Speaker 2>car.</v>

216
00:12:55.090 --> 00:12:55.923
<v Speaker 2>Leather is the instrumental case suffix,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is used here to show who is being </v>

217
00:13:00.011 --> 00:13:00.844
<v Speaker 2>caused to do something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's basic forms are evolve and vel </v>

218
00:13:04.510 --> 00:13:05.343
<v Speaker 2>depending on vowel harmony.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But when attached to announce ending in </v>

219
00:13:08.321 --> 00:13:11.770
<v Speaker 2>a consonant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>The v assimilates to the final consonant</v>

220
00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:13.420
<v Speaker 2>resulting in germination,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

221
00:13:13.421 --> 00:13:14.254
<v Speaker 2>doubled.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Consonant Oz is the definite article </v>

222
00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:21.160
<v Speaker 2>before we saw the form awe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when the noun begins with a vowel,</v>

223
00:13:21.190 --> 00:13:22.023
<v Speaker 2>then the form Oz is used.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The term at the end of our tote is the </v>

224
00:13:25.931 --> 00:13:26.764
<v Speaker 2>accusative case ending,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is used to indicate the direct </v>

225
00:13:29.201 --> 00:13:34.201
<v Speaker 2>object cases.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the most notorious aspects of the</v>

226
00:13:34.331 --> 00:13:38.350
<v Speaker 2>Hungarian language is it system of cases</v>
<v Speaker 2>which are attached to nouns.</v>

227
00:13:38.530 --> 00:13:42.100
<v Speaker 2>There are 18 cases though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some people will say there are more.</v>

228
00:13:42.430 --> 00:13:44.920
<v Speaker 2>Look at these tables for the noun </v>
<v Speaker 2>meaning car.</v>

229
00:13:45.310 --> 00:13:47.470
<v Speaker 2>This looks pretty intimidating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>However,</v>

230
00:13:47.500 --> 00:13:51.550
<v Speaker 2>most of these case endings function in a</v>
<v Speaker 2>similar way to prepositions in English,</v>

231
00:13:51.580 --> 00:13:53.380
<v Speaker 2>except that they are after the word.</v>

232
00:13:53.500 --> 00:13:55.660
<v Speaker 2>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're like post positions.</v>

233
00:13:55.870 --> 00:13:57.570
<v Speaker 2>Take the date of case form.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

234
00:13:57.600 --> 00:13:59.920
<v Speaker 2>don't fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This means to the car.</v>

235
00:14:00.250 --> 00:14:02.020
<v Speaker 2>The instrumental case,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

236
00:14:02.021 --> 00:14:05.710
<v Speaker 2>dovall would mean by car the terminated </v>
<v Speaker 2>case.</v>

237
00:14:05.890 --> 00:14:09.520
<v Speaker 2>Oh de League would mean something like </v>
<v Speaker 2>as far as the car.</v>

238
00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:10.473
<v Speaker 2>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you were going to walk until you </v>

239
00:14:12.011 --> 00:14:14.470
<v Speaker 2>reached the car,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the ines IV case,</v>

240
00:14:14.670 --> 00:14:18.610
<v Speaker 2>oh bum would mean in the car,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the ablative case,</v>

241
00:14:18.700 --> 00:14:22.120
<v Speaker 2>outdoor coil would mean away from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>car and so on.</v>

242
00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:26.590
<v Speaker 2>So thinking of them as post positions </v>
<v Speaker 2>rather than case endings might make it a</v>

243
00:14:26.591 --> 00:14:27.424
<v Speaker 2>little less intimidating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it may look like there are separate </v>

244
00:14:30.191 --> 00:14:32.710
<v Speaker 2>forms for plural nouns,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the really aren't.</v>

245
00:14:32.980 --> 00:14:33.813
<v Speaker 2>The plural forms simply have the plural </v>
<v Speaker 2>suffix [inaudible] and then the case </v>

246
00:14:36.731 --> 00:14:37.564
<v Speaker 2>endings are added after that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The only tweak to that is the double </v>

247
00:14:40.631 --> 00:14:43.420
<v Speaker 2>consonant in the instrumental case that </v>
<v Speaker 2>we saw before,</v>

248
00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:46.930
<v Speaker 2>as well as in another case called the </v>
<v Speaker 2>translative case.</v>

249
00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:50.770
<v Speaker 2>Unlike in many other languages,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cases only affect nouns,</v>

250
00:14:50.790 --> 00:14:54.770
<v Speaker 2>not adjectives or articles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In addition to cases,</v>

251
00:14:54.771 --> 00:14:55.604
<v Speaker 2>there are also possessive suffixes and </v>
<v Speaker 2>these can be used together with various </v>

252
00:14:59.001 --> 00:15:01.970
<v Speaker 2>case endings.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh Dome my car.</v>

253
00:15:02.210 --> 00:15:03.043
<v Speaker 2>And to express this fully,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we need to use the definite article </v>

254
00:15:06.230 --> 00:15:07.063
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] I am in my car as oh towed </v>
<v Speaker 2>your car and she shit cause I'm walking </v>

255
00:15:15.201 --> 00:15:20.200
<v Speaker 2>away from your car.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or maybe it would be as [inaudible].</v>

256
00:15:20.600 --> 00:15:24.410
<v Speaker 2>I'm walking away from your car with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>emphasis on your car.</v>

257
00:15:24.660 --> 00:15:27.230
<v Speaker 2>Hungarian word order is not set in </v>
<v Speaker 2>stone.</v>

258
00:15:27.290 --> 00:15:30.350
<v Speaker 2>When something appears before the verb,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is emphasized,</v>

259
00:15:30.410 --> 00:15:34.040
<v Speaker 2>so by moving the Noun to the beginning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we are placing emphasis on it.</v>

260
00:15:34.280 --> 00:15:35.113
<v Speaker 2>The verb prefix or pre verb l meaning </v>
<v Speaker 2>away also moves out of the way when </v>

261
00:15:39.111 --> 00:15:42.200
<v Speaker 2>something else is placed in front of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>verb to emphasize it,</v>

262
00:15:42.350 --> 00:15:43.183
<v Speaker 2>it's like the main verb is handing the </v>
<v Speaker 2>emphasis over to whatever comes before </v>

263
00:15:46.611 --> 00:15:48.710
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if there's a pre verb in the way,</v>

264
00:15:48.770 --> 00:15:52.940
<v Speaker 2>the main verb can't pass the emphasis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if the pre verb gets out of the way,</v>

265
00:15:52.970 --> 00:15:56.120
<v Speaker 2>then there's nothing blocking the </v>
<v Speaker 2>emphasis from being handed over.</v>

266
00:15:56.600 --> 00:15:59.510
<v Speaker 2>Since these pre verbs can be split from </v>
<v Speaker 2>the main verb,</v>

267
00:15:59.540 --> 00:16:00.373
<v Speaker 2>they can be referred to as co verbs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's add an adverb to this sentence as </v>

268
00:16:05.010 --> 00:16:06.760
<v Speaker 2>shit [inaudible].</v>

269
00:16:07.460 --> 00:16:12.460
<v Speaker 2>This means I'm walking slowly away from </v>
<v Speaker 2>your car with no particular emphasis now</v>

270
00:16:13.170 --> 00:16:15.370
<v Speaker 2>loves sean shade.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That'll cause a toto.</v>

271
00:16:15.830 --> 00:16:16.663
<v Speaker 2>This means I'm walking slowly away from </v>
<v Speaker 2>your car with the emphasis on slowly </v>

272
00:16:21.890 --> 00:16:22.723
<v Speaker 2>when there's an explicit subject placing</v>
<v Speaker 2>it before the verb places emphasis on </v>

273
00:16:26.661 --> 00:16:28.300
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If there's no pre bourbon,</v>

274
00:16:28.310 --> 00:16:33.310
<v Speaker 2>the way Michael [inaudible],</v>
<v Speaker 2>Michael is walking slowly away from your</v>

275
00:16:33.951 --> 00:16:34.784
<v Speaker 2>car.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This sentence has no particular </v>

276
00:16:36.171 --> 00:16:37.004
<v Speaker 2>emphasis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but let's get the pre verb out of the </v>

277
00:16:38.691 --> 00:16:41.240
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My good shape that allison has,</v>

278
00:16:41.250 --> 00:16:44.570
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>toto Michael is walking slowly away from</v>

279
00:16:44.571 --> 00:16:45.404
<v Speaker 2>your car here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The emphasis is on Michael because it </v>

280
00:16:47.871 --> 00:16:48.704
<v Speaker 2>comes right before the verb.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My coolest [inaudible] Michael is </v>

281
00:16:53.211 --> 00:16:55.760
<v Speaker 2>walking slowly away from your car.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>

282
00:16:55.761 --> 00:17:00.761
<v Speaker 2>the emphasis here is on La Shaunn slowly</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it comes right before the verb.</v>

283
00:17:01.070 --> 00:17:01.903
<v Speaker 2>This position right before the verb is </v>
<v Speaker 2>the most emphatic if the verb comes at </v>

284
00:17:06.141 --> 00:17:09.860
<v Speaker 2>the beginning before an explicit subject</v>
<v Speaker 2>than the verbus emphasized,</v>

285
00:17:10.130 --> 00:17:13.040
<v Speaker 2>but for this sentence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the meaning wouldn't really make sense.</v>

286
00:17:14.360 --> 00:17:15.193
<v Speaker 2>A couple of notes on Hungarian phonology</v>
<v Speaker 2>and orthography in terms of phonology </v>

287
00:17:19.281 --> 00:17:20.114
<v Speaker 2>and orthography Hungarians,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not exactly the simplest language out </v>

288
00:17:22.881 --> 00:17:24.920
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are 14 vowels.</v>

289
00:17:24.980 --> 00:17:25.813
<v Speaker 2>This includes seven pairs of short and </v>
<v Speaker 2>long equivalent with the acute accents </v>

290
00:17:29.750 --> 00:17:30.583
<v Speaker 2>indicating long vowels.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the immediately noticeable </v>

291
00:17:32.991 --> 00:17:33.824
<v Speaker 2>features is the double acute accent to </v>
<v Speaker 2>show the long equivalents of the vowels </v>

292
00:17:37.251 --> 00:17:41.270
<v Speaker 2>with uhmm louts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are also 30 consonants for a total</v>

293
00:17:41.271 --> 00:17:42.104
<v Speaker 2>of 44 letters in the Hungarian alphabet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but some of the consonants consist of </v>

294
00:17:45.981 --> 00:17:49.500
<v Speaker 2>two or three orthographic letters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These consonants with Y,</v>

295
00:17:49.560 --> 00:17:52.560
<v Speaker 2>our palatalized consonants,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and there are these others.</v>

296
00:17:52.820 --> 00:17:55.100
<v Speaker 2>See s equals chuck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>D,</v>

297
00:17:55.230 --> 00:17:56.950
<v Speaker 2>Z,</v>
<v Speaker 2>s equals j,</v>

298
00:17:56.970 --> 00:17:57.691
<v Speaker 2>e,</v>
<v Speaker 2>s,</v>

299
00:17:57.691 --> 00:18:01.230
<v Speaker 2>z equals C and Z,</v>
<v Speaker 2>s equals g.</v>

300
00:18:01.860 --> 00:18:02.693
<v Speaker 2>In addition to palatalized consonants,</v>
<v Speaker 2>another common phonological and </v>

301
00:18:05.821 --> 00:18:06.654
<v Speaker 2>orthographic feature is germination </v>
<v Speaker 2>lengthened consonants that are </v>

302
00:18:09.571 --> 00:18:11.970
<v Speaker 2>represented by double consonants in </v>
<v Speaker 2>writing.</v>

303
00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:15.990
<v Speaker 2>If you see a sentence that contains </v>
<v Speaker 2>double consonants,</v>

304
00:18:16.020 --> 00:18:19.290
<v Speaker 2>consonants followed by Y and multiple </v>
<v Speaker 2>acute accents,</v>

305
00:18:19.350 --> 00:18:21.450
<v Speaker 2>Uhmm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>louts or a double a cute accent,</v>

306
00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:23.910
<v Speaker 2>then you're almost certainly looking at </v>
<v Speaker 2>Hungarian.</v>

307
00:18:24.510 --> 00:18:27.720
<v Speaker 2>Let's look at one final sentence in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Hungarian and break it down.</v>

308
00:18:28.320 --> 00:18:29.300
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybodyokay Hash,</v>

309
00:18:29.310 --> 00:18:31.530
<v Speaker 2>mathematic ab,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that damage cabbies album.</v>

310
00:18:31.830 --> 00:18:32.663
<v Speaker 2>The sentence means I'm not hungry </v>
<v Speaker 2>because I already ate lunch at a cafe </v>

311
00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:37.710
<v Speaker 2>word for word.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's no,</v>

312
00:18:37.770 --> 00:18:41.600
<v Speaker 2>I am hungry because already I have </v>
<v Speaker 2>lunch,</v>

313
00:18:41.740 --> 00:18:46.260
<v Speaker 2>a cafe in first we see the negation word</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nem.</v>

314
00:18:46.440 --> 00:18:47.273
<v Speaker 2>This word doesn't change and you just </v>
<v Speaker 2>put it before the part of the sentence </v>

315
00:18:50.041 --> 00:18:50.874
<v Speaker 2>that you want to make negative.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are other forms of negotiation as </v>

316
00:18:53.611 --> 00:18:54.444
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but this is the basic way in indicative </v>

317
00:18:56.101 --> 00:18:56.934
<v Speaker 2>sentences.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Next we see video which means I am this </v>

318
00:19:00.511 --> 00:19:01.344
<v Speaker 2>ending.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh is a typical present tense ending </v>

319
00:19:03.721 --> 00:19:07.650
<v Speaker 2>meaning I with its vowel harmonizing </v>
<v Speaker 2>with this a vowel awe.</v>

320
00:19:07.800 --> 00:19:10.980
<v Speaker 2>But this verb is a rather special one in</v>
<v Speaker 2>irregular verb.</v>

321
00:19:11.040 --> 00:19:14.910
<v Speaker 2>Removing oak would give you the third </v>
<v Speaker 2>person singular present tense form.</v>

322
00:19:14.970 --> 00:19:15.803
<v Speaker 2>But for this verb,</v>
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] is the second person </v>

323
00:19:17.941 --> 00:19:20.940
<v Speaker 2>singular and the third person singular </v>
<v Speaker 2>is Vaughn.</v>

324
00:19:21.510 --> 00:19:22.343
<v Speaker 2>It also has a different past tense stem </v>
<v Speaker 2>voight and it's also the only Hungarian </v>

325
00:19:27.121 --> 00:19:29.790
<v Speaker 2>verb with its own inflected.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Future tense form.</v>

326
00:19:29.940 --> 00:19:33.660
<v Speaker 2>Other verbs express the future using two</v>
<v Speaker 2>verbs like we saw before.</v>

327
00:19:35.700 --> 00:19:40.200
<v Speaker 2>A Hash is the word for hungry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The singular form of this word is always</v>

328
00:19:40.201 --> 00:19:44.550
<v Speaker 2>the same and has never inflected for </v>
<v Speaker 2>gender or case and be that,</v>

329
00:19:44.610 --> 00:19:45.443
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is the first person singular past tense </v>

330
00:19:47.430 --> 00:19:48.263
<v Speaker 2>of the verb,</v>
<v Speaker 2>meaning to have lunch and the identity </v>

331
00:19:50.490 --> 00:19:51.323
<v Speaker 2>which has the base form and Ba da them </v>
<v Speaker 2>is the first person singular past tense </v>

332
00:19:55.891 --> 00:19:59.220
<v Speaker 2>inflection and vowel harmony determines </v>
<v Speaker 2>that it's dumb.</v>

333
00:19:59.280 --> 00:20:02.520
<v Speaker 2>Not Dumb.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is the indefinite conjugation.</v>

334
00:20:02.550 --> 00:20:04.980
<v Speaker 2>But for the first person singular past </v>
<v Speaker 2>tense,</v>

335
00:20:05.010 --> 00:20:10.010
<v Speaker 2>the definite and indefinite forms are </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually the same edge is the indefinite</v>

336
00:20:10.351 --> 00:20:11.184
<v Speaker 2>article.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Got Album is the word for cafe with the </v>

337
00:20:14.370 --> 00:20:16.890
<v Speaker 2>NSF case ending bond.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In other words,</v>

338
00:20:16.920 --> 00:20:17.753
<v Speaker 2>it's like a post position meaning him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's worth noting that this ending </v>

339
00:20:21.271 --> 00:20:23.040
<v Speaker 2>is bond,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not Ben,</v>

340
00:20:23.070 --> 00:20:25.110
<v Speaker 2>because it's in harmony with the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

341
00:20:25.111 --> 00:20:28.950
<v Speaker 2>at the end of Kava is old.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As you can probably see,</v>

342
00:20:28.951 --> 00:20:29.784
<v Speaker 2>Hungarian is quite different from any </v>
<v Speaker 2>Indo European language and it's </v>

343
00:20:32.521 --> 00:20:33.990
<v Speaker 2>different from any other language.</v>

344
00:20:33.990 --> 00:20:34.823
<v Speaker 2>In Europe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a gluten native grammar and it's </v>

345
00:20:36.481 --> 00:20:40.680
<v Speaker 2>now in cases which functions somewhat </v>
<v Speaker 2>like post positions are somewhat similar</v>

346
00:20:40.681 --> 00:20:41.514
<v Speaker 2>to other pheno eugric languages,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there are also differences and it </v>

347
00:20:44.611 --> 00:20:48.190
<v Speaker 2>contains much less Finnell eugric </v>
<v Speaker 2>vocabulary than you might expect.</v>

348
00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:49.233
<v Speaker 2>But despite being different,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hungarian is really not as complicated </v>

349
00:20:52.061 --> 00:20:52.894
<v Speaker 2>as people make it out to beat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The noun cases aren't that hard to wrap </v>

350
00:20:55.601 --> 00:20:56.434
<v Speaker 2>your head around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you think of them like post </v>

351
00:20:57.611 --> 00:20:58.444
<v Speaker 2>positions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>vowel harmony isn't that hard to get </v>

352
00:21:00.341 --> 00:21:01.174
<v Speaker 2>used to because there are a limited </v>
<v Speaker 2>number of variations and indefinite and </v>

353
00:21:04.871 --> 00:21:07.210
<v Speaker 2>definite conjugations work very </v>
<v Speaker 2>logically.</v>

354
00:21:07.240 --> 00:21:08.980
<v Speaker 2>It just takes some time to get used to </v>
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

355
00:21:09.280 --> 00:21:11.680
<v Speaker 2>And other aspects of Hungarian are quite</v>
<v Speaker 2>simple.</v>

356
00:21:11.710 --> 00:21:14.740
<v Speaker 2>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no grammatical gender at all and</v>

357
00:21:14.770 --> 00:21:15.603
<v Speaker 2>adjectives and articles are not </v>
<v Speaker 2>inflected for case which makes dealing </v>

358
00:21:18.431 --> 00:21:19.264
<v Speaker 2>with the cases much simpler.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The main point I'm getting at is that </v>

359
00:21:21.881 --> 00:21:23.860
<v Speaker 2>after digging into Hungarian a little </v>
<v Speaker 2>bit,</v>

360
00:21:23.861 --> 00:21:25.900
<v Speaker 2>just enough to make this language </v>
<v Speaker 2>profile,</v>

361
00:21:25.930 --> 00:21:26.763
<v Speaker 2>I've come away with the impression that </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not as complicated as I had been </v>

362
00:21:29.681 --> 00:21:30.580
<v Speaker 2>led to believe.</v>

363
00:21:30.790 --> 00:21:31.623
<v Speaker 2>So if you're interested in the Hungarian</v>
<v Speaker 2>people or the Hungarian culture or the </v>

364
00:21:34.481 --> 00:21:35.314
<v Speaker 2>country of Hungary,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then don't be scared to start learning </v>

365
00:21:37.271 --> 00:21:38.104
<v Speaker 2>the Hungarian language as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The question of the day to native </v>

366
00:21:40.841 --> 00:21:41.674
<v Speaker 2>speakers of Hungarian,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what language or languages do you think </v>

367
00:21:44.201 --> 00:21:47.950
<v Speaker 2>share the most similarities with </v>
<v Speaker 2>Hungarian and to learners of Hungarian?</v>

368
00:21:48.130 --> 00:21:51.670
<v Speaker 2>What aspects of the language have you </v>
<v Speaker 2>found most challenging and what has been</v>

369
00:21:51.671 --> 00:21:54.070
<v Speaker 2>more straight forward?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Be sure to follow Lang,</v>

370
00:21:54.071 --> 00:21:55.930
<v Speaker 2>focus on facebook,</v>
