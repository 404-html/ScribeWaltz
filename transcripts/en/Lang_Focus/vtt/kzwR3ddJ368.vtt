<v Speaker 1>Marsha is if I say like who comes </v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] Marsha say if I say like who</v>

2
00:00:07.841 --> 00:00:10.200
<v Speaker 1>comes to see?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Marsha said,</v>

3
00:00:10.201 --> 00:00:11.880
<v Speaker 1>if I say like you [inaudible]</v>

4
00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:18.363
<v Speaker 2>good evening everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Today I'm going to talk about how to </v>

5
00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:21.663
<v Speaker 2>improve your listening comprehension in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the target language that you are </v>

6
00:00:25.751 --> 00:00:29.050
<v Speaker 2>studying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now I should point out in advance,</v>

7
00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:32.500
<v Speaker 2>I'm not talking to people who don't know</v>
<v Speaker 2>any of the language yet.</v>

8
00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:33.483
<v Speaker 2>There's no point trying to improve your </v>
<v Speaker 2>listening comprehension if you don't </v>

9
00:00:36.521 --> 00:00:39.730
<v Speaker 2>know the phonology,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the basic grammar and sentence structure</v>

10
00:00:39.731 --> 00:00:40.564
<v Speaker 2>and basic vocabulary of the language.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really I'm talking to people who are </v>

11
00:00:43.451 --> 00:00:46.720
<v Speaker 2>already studying the language,</v>
<v Speaker 2>already know some of the basics,</v>

12
00:00:46.721 --> 00:00:47.554
<v Speaker 2>but their listening comprehension is not</v>
<v Speaker 2>up to speed with their other skills and </v>

13
00:00:52.151 --> 00:00:54.640
<v Speaker 2>other awareness of the language.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>

14
00:00:54.641 --> 00:00:57.940
<v Speaker 2>so the most important thing is to listen</v>
<v Speaker 2>to every day.</v>

15
00:00:57.970 --> 00:00:58.803
<v Speaker 2>Consistency is king.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You want to practice listening every </v>

16
00:01:01.051 --> 00:01:01.884
<v Speaker 2>day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Make sure you are practicing listening </v>

17
00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:04.173
<v Speaker 2>just as much as you are practicing </v>
<v Speaker 2>reading or practicing speaking or </v>

18
00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:10.300
<v Speaker 2>learning grammar and vocabulary.</v>

19
00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:11.253
<v Speaker 2>Spend just as much time on the listening</v>
<v Speaker 2>because obviously that's of key </v>

20
00:01:14.921 --> 00:01:17.530
<v Speaker 2>importance when you want to communicate </v>
<v Speaker 2>with people.</v>

21
00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:20.830
<v Speaker 2>So these days it's very easy to do every</v>
<v Speaker 2>day.</v>

22
00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:23.050
<v Speaker 2>Even if you live in the middle of </v>
<v Speaker 2>nowhere.</v>

23
00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:23.913
<v Speaker 2>If you have an internet connection,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have no excuse to not practice the </v>

24
00:01:27.071 --> 00:01:27.904
<v Speaker 2>listening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I studied Hebrew language back in </v>

25
00:01:30.881 --> 00:01:31.714
<v Speaker 2>like 1997 in those days,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Internet was just getting off the </v>

26
00:01:35.201 --> 00:01:37.120
<v Speaker 2>ground.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There were very few resources.</v>

27
00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:40.030
<v Speaker 2>You guys today are very lucky.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Make use of them.</v>

28
00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:43.420
<v Speaker 2>You have a youtube videos,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all languages have,</v>

29
00:01:43.421 --> 00:01:44.254
<v Speaker 2>you have videos available on Youtube.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure you can find something good </v>

30
00:01:47.141 --> 00:01:48.150
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

31
00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:51.490
<v Speaker 2>as well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can find streaming radio stations,</v>

32
00:01:51.491 --> 00:01:53.690
<v Speaker 2>streaming news networks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

33
00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:54.723
<v Speaker 2>streaming television stations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can find downloadable videos on </v>

34
00:01:58.091 --> 00:02:01.150
<v Speaker 2>demand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>full movies and your target language.</v>

35
00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:04.180
<v Speaker 2>You can find everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So make sure you get some of that.</v>

36
00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:06.340
<v Speaker 2>No excuses.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do it every day.</v>

37
00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:07.413
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One piece of advice I will give you is </v>

38
00:02:08.981 --> 00:02:13.090
<v Speaker 2>to use videos and to use videos that </v>
<v Speaker 2>have subtitles.</v>

39
00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:14.223
<v Speaker 2>So if you get a DVD,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes you can set the subtitles on </v>

40
00:02:17.411 --> 00:02:20.380
<v Speaker 2>so you can watch with the subtitles and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then maybe remove them.</v>

41
00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:21.573
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but also on the internet you can find </v>

42
00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:26.160
<v Speaker 2>videos that have been,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

43
00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:30.580
<v Speaker 2>they've had subtitles added to them as a</v>
<v Speaker 2>way to help second language learners.</v>

44
00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:31.563
<v Speaker 2>Like I found a website for French that </v>
<v Speaker 2>had all sorts of movies with subtitles </v>

45
00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:36.963
<v Speaker 2>added to them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>French movies that somebody added the </v>

46
00:02:38.681 --> 00:02:41.770
<v Speaker 2>subtitles as a way to help second </v>
<v Speaker 2>language learners,</v>

47
00:02:41.771 --> 00:02:42.604
<v Speaker 2>French learners.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there are materials out there like </v>

48
00:02:44.261 --> 00:02:48.820
<v Speaker 2>that with subtitles and those are very </v>
<v Speaker 2>useful for helping you make a connection</v>

49
00:02:48.821 --> 00:02:53.260
<v Speaker 2>between the visual and the auditory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some people are more visual learners,</v>

50
00:02:53.261 --> 00:02:57.280
<v Speaker 2>they need to understand the language </v>
<v Speaker 2>visually and conceptualize it visually.</v>

51
00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:58.323
<v Speaker 2>And if you're just listening,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes won't be able to perceive the </v>

52
00:03:00.551 --> 00:03:03.520
<v Speaker 2>sounds until you make that connection </v>
<v Speaker 2>with the written word.</v>

53
00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:04.623
<v Speaker 2>So the subtitles help you do that to </v>
<v Speaker 2>make that connection between the sound </v>

54
00:03:07.271 --> 00:03:11.680
<v Speaker 2>and the visual.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I recommend that you listen with the</v>

55
00:03:11.681 --> 00:03:12.514
<v Speaker 2>subtitles first,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then you can remove them if it's a </v>

56
00:03:14.951 --> 00:03:18.520
<v Speaker 2>DVD and you can remove the subtitles </v>
<v Speaker 2>with the setting then do that.</v>

57
00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:19.623
<v Speaker 2>But if the subtitles are kind of are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're already edited into the video </v>

58
00:03:23.261 --> 00:03:26.260
<v Speaker 2>and you can't remove them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you can try it as closing your eyes</v>

59
00:03:26.261 --> 00:03:28.450
<v Speaker 2>or covering your eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can do that.</v>

60
00:03:28.451 --> 00:03:29.284
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure after you are already familiar </v>
<v Speaker 2>with the content of the video and you </v>

61
00:03:32.381 --> 00:03:33.214
<v Speaker 2>know what it's about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know the the topic and stuff from </v>

62
00:03:35.321 --> 00:03:38.770
<v Speaker 2>reading it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you can switch off the subtitles.</v>

63
00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:39.633
<v Speaker 2>Just tried to rely on your hearing the </v>
<v Speaker 2>second time around and you are getting </v>

64
00:03:43.001 --> 00:03:43.834
<v Speaker 2>rid of that visual crutch after you've </v>
<v Speaker 2>already made the connection between </v>

65
00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:49.000
<v Speaker 2>auditory and visual.</v>

66
00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:50.103
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So watch once with subtitles once </v>

67
00:03:51.071 --> 00:03:53.740
<v Speaker 2>without train yourself like that to just</v>
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>

68
00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:55.083
<v Speaker 2>I should say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They'll be where of captions on Youtube </v>

69
00:03:57.761 --> 00:04:01.150
<v Speaker 2>or any automatically generated captions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They usually suck.</v>

70
00:04:01.151 --> 00:04:03.970
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes they're hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you want a good laugh,</v>

71
00:04:03.971 --> 00:04:06.580
<v Speaker 2>you can watch them and figure out what </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're saying.</v>

72
00:04:06.581 --> 00:04:08.950
<v Speaker 2>Usually it's way off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So just be careful.</v>

73
00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:11.500
<v Speaker 2>The captions are not usually accurate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

74
00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:16.090
<v Speaker 2>I recommend that you practice listening </v>
<v Speaker 2>to a variety of different levels.</v>

75
00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:21.220
<v Speaker 2>So some materials out there are made for</v>
<v Speaker 2>second language learners.</v>

76
00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:22.083
<v Speaker 2>So they are graded,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they use grated language that's aimed </v>

77
00:04:23.981 --> 00:04:24.820
<v Speaker 2>at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

78
00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:28.090
<v Speaker 2>beginners or intermediate level or upper</v>
<v Speaker 2>intermediate,</v>

79
00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:29.163
<v Speaker 2>the languages tailored for learners.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's simpler and it's easier for you </v>

80
00:04:32.951 --> 00:04:33.784
<v Speaker 2>to grasp and understand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I recommend you use that sometimes </v>

81
00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:38.583
<v Speaker 2>because that helps you consolidate the </v>
<v Speaker 2>things that you are learning in your </v>

82
00:04:41.441 --> 00:04:42.274
<v Speaker 2>textbook,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the things that you are studying or the </v>

83
00:04:43.721 --> 00:04:45.490
<v Speaker 2>things you learn in class from your </v>
<v Speaker 2>teacher.</v>

84
00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:47.103
<v Speaker 2>If you use a simple video,</v>
<v Speaker 2>simple audio too that will help you </v>

85
00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:53.140
<v Speaker 2>review and consolidate things you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>already learning.</v>

86
00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:57.310
<v Speaker 2>And it's encouraging because it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not too far above your level,</v>

87
00:04:57.311 --> 00:04:58.144
<v Speaker 2>not too far out of your comfort zone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you will be able to understand a lot </v>

88
00:05:01.871 --> 00:05:02.704
<v Speaker 2>of it and that will be encouraging for </v>
<v Speaker 2>you and you'll feel that you're </v>

89
00:05:04.211 --> 00:05:05.044
<v Speaker 2>improving and you're using the language </v>
<v Speaker 2>for something functional so you'll feel </v>

90
00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:09.573
<v Speaker 2>good and encouraged.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But at the same time I recommend that </v>

91
00:05:12.041 --> 00:05:16.210
<v Speaker 2>you use more difficult materials that </v>
<v Speaker 2>are aimed at native speakers.</v>

92
00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:19.090
<v Speaker 2>So listen to the radio,</v>
<v Speaker 2>listen to the news,</v>

93
00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:21.160
<v Speaker 2>watch TV shows,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that kind of thing.</v>

94
00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:24.760
<v Speaker 2>And just experience the sound of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>language.</v>

95
00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.900
<v Speaker 2>I recommend that you have no </v>
<v Speaker 2>expectations of understanding.</v>

96
00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:29.763
<v Speaker 2>You just relax.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't put any pressure on yourself </v>

97
00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:36.400
<v Speaker 2>to have good comprehension.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just want to just hear the sounds of</v>

98
00:05:36.401 --> 00:05:39.430
<v Speaker 2>the language and notice the things that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you recognize.</v>

99
00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:41.650
<v Speaker 2>Even if you don't understand what's </v>
<v Speaker 2>being said,</v>

100
00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:42.510
<v Speaker 2>just think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>

101
00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:44.710
<v Speaker 2>I remember that word,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've heard that before.</v>

102
00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:45.843
<v Speaker 2>And notice the patterns of intonation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Notice where if you notice where one </v>

103
00:05:50.291 --> 00:05:53.920
<v Speaker 2>word starts and then ends or you notice </v>
<v Speaker 2>where the next word begins,</v>

104
00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:56.230
<v Speaker 2>that's that's all fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just notice that.</v>

105
00:05:56.590 --> 00:05:57.423
<v Speaker 2>Don't worry about trying to understand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just want to internalize those </v>

106
00:06:00.891 --> 00:06:01.724
<v Speaker 2>patterns subconsciously.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So then once you are study gets to that </v>

107
00:06:06.231 --> 00:06:07.064
<v Speaker 2>level,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you will be very well prepared to to </v>

108
00:06:09.201 --> 00:06:10.034
<v Speaker 2>understand it because you've already </v>
<v Speaker 2>internalized all of those auditory </v>

109
00:06:14.181 --> 00:06:15.080
<v Speaker 2>patterns.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

110
00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:18.800
<v Speaker 2>so I recommend you listen to simpler </v>
<v Speaker 2>materials.</v>

111
00:06:18.801 --> 00:06:23.801
<v Speaker 2>Also more challenging materials.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just listen and experience the sounds.</v>

112
00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:25.213
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the last thing I'll recommend is to </v>

113
00:06:27.501 --> 00:06:31.010
<v Speaker 2>speak with native speakers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it sounds obvious to some of you,</v>

114
00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:35.240
<v Speaker 2>but a lot of people still just studying </v>
<v Speaker 2>books and they still,</v>

115
00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:36.883
<v Speaker 2>they still just learn to read and write </v>
<v Speaker 2>and make sentences out loud in the </v>

116
00:06:39.891 --> 00:06:42.350
<v Speaker 2>language without actually talking to </v>
<v Speaker 2>native speakers.</v>

117
00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:44.240
<v Speaker 2>But these days with the Internet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

118
00:06:44.241 --> 00:06:45.074
<v Speaker 2>you have no excuse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can go to [inaudible] dot com and </v>

119
00:06:48.351 --> 00:06:51.170
<v Speaker 2>you can find a skype teacher.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some of them are really cheap.</v>

120
00:06:51.171 --> 00:06:52.730
<v Speaker 2>Depending on the language you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>speaking,</v>

121
00:06:52.910 --> 00:06:53.743
<v Speaker 2>you can sometimes get a lesson for like </v>
<v Speaker 2>$5 per hour or $10 per hour is more </v>

122
00:06:57.771 --> 00:06:58.740
<v Speaker 2>common.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

123
00:06:58.910 --> 00:07:00.860
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's cheap and it's effective.</v>

124
00:07:00.861 --> 00:07:04.640
<v Speaker 2>You need to speak with native speakers </v>
<v Speaker 2>in your target language,</v>

125
00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:08.930
<v Speaker 2>especially in an uncontrolled context.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if it's just,</v>

126
00:07:08.931 --> 00:07:13.070
<v Speaker 2>I'm a very structured,</v>
<v Speaker 2>scripted lesson where they do listen and</v>

127
00:07:13.071 --> 00:07:13.904
<v Speaker 2>repeat with you are they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have you just read sentences and that </v>

128
00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:20.720
<v Speaker 2>kind of thing that's not as beneficial.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You want to have some surprises.</v>

129
00:07:20.721 --> 00:07:23.600
<v Speaker 2>You want it to be uncontrolled so that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

130
00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:27.500
<v Speaker 2>you hear things you weren't expecting </v>
<v Speaker 2>and that kind of trains you to,</v>

131
00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:31.970
<v Speaker 2>to not panic when you hear things that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't understand,</v>

132
00:07:31.971 --> 00:07:32.870
<v Speaker 2>to just relax.</v>

133
00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:36.230
<v Speaker 2>And notice the things that you do </v>
<v Speaker 2>understand to use all of the cues,</v>

134
00:07:36.470 --> 00:07:40.670
<v Speaker 2>all of the signals that help you </v>
<v Speaker 2>understand including intonation,</v>

135
00:07:40.671 --> 00:07:42.200
<v Speaker 2>including,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

136
00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:44.570
<v Speaker 2>including context,</v>
<v Speaker 2>including body language,</v>

137
00:07:44.571 --> 00:07:45.404
<v Speaker 2>all that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just want to train yourself to </v>

138
00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:48.913
<v Speaker 2>notice the things that help you </v>
<v Speaker 2>understand and ignore the stuff that </v>

139
00:07:50.991 --> 00:07:53.030
<v Speaker 2>doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why it's good to,</v>

140
00:07:53.540 --> 00:07:57.890
<v Speaker 2>to practice in an uncontrolled the </v>
<v Speaker 2>context with native speakers so that you</v>

141
00:07:57.891 --> 00:08:00.830
<v Speaker 2>are doing that with the native sounds of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the language.</v>

142
00:08:01.540 --> 00:08:03.710
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so those are my pieces of advice for how</v>

143
00:08:03.711 --> 00:08:06.980
<v Speaker 2>to improve listening comprehension.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not rocket science.</v>

144
00:08:06.981 --> 00:08:07.814
<v Speaker 2>You just need to do it every day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are tons of resources on the </v>

145
00:08:10.551 --> 00:08:12.290
<v Speaker 2>Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can use radio,</v>

146
00:08:12.291 --> 00:08:14.390
<v Speaker 2>you can use videos,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can watch youtube,</v>

147
00:08:14.570 --> 00:08:15.403
<v Speaker 2>all that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Get a teacher through I talky or some </v>

148
00:08:17.241 --> 00:08:21.350
<v Speaker 2>service like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Speak with people and use subtitles when</v>

149
00:08:21.351 --> 00:08:22.880
<v Speaker 2>you watch videos.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Subtitles.</v>

150
00:08:22.940 --> 00:08:23.773
<v Speaker 2>Not all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there are a good tool to help you </v>

151
00:08:25.101 --> 00:08:27.920
<v Speaker 2>connect the visual and the auditory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>

152
00:08:28.110 --> 00:08:30.350
<v Speaker 2>I hope that made sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hope that was helpful.</v>

153
00:08:30.620 --> 00:08:31.550
