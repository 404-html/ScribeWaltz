<v Speaker 1>and instagram.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hello everyone.</v>

3
00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:08.370
<v Speaker 1>Welcome to the Lange Focus Channel and </v>
<v Speaker 1>my name is Paul.</v>

4
00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:09.273
<v Speaker 1>Today's video is a quick video to </v>
<v Speaker 1>explain a concept that I often talk </v>

5
00:00:12.161 --> 00:00:12.994
<v Speaker 1>about in my videos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the viewer sometimes don't </v>

6
00:00:14.441 --> 00:00:16.750
<v Speaker 1>understand and they ask me about in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>comments.</v>

7
00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:17.793
<v Speaker 1>The concept is grammatical case case </v>
<v Speaker 1>refers to the grammatical function of a </v>

8
00:00:21.731 --> 00:00:24.430
<v Speaker 1>noun or a pronoun in the sentence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

9
00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:26.380
<v Speaker 1>if these are all the words in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>sentence,</v>

10
00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:29.100
<v Speaker 1>eight lion honeybadger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ah,</v>

11
00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:31.660
<v Speaker 1>there are two possible messages.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This one,</v>

12
00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:34.540
<v Speaker 1>the lion ate the honeybadger or this </v>
<v Speaker 1>one,</v>

13
00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:38.830
<v Speaker 1>the honey badger eight the lion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are two roles in the sentence.</v>

14
00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:42.190
<v Speaker 1>The animal doing the eating and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>animal being eaten in English.</v>

15
00:00:42.191 --> 00:00:45.580
<v Speaker 1>We normally know which role announced as</v>
<v Speaker 1>fulfilling based on word order.</v>

16
00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:50.050
<v Speaker 1>The subject of the sentence comes here </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the object of a sentence comes here.</v>

17
00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:52.810
<v Speaker 1>Prepositions can also tell us announce </v>
<v Speaker 1>function.</v>

18
00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:53.703
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the honey badger gave a warning to the </v>

19
00:00:55.571 --> 00:00:58.390
<v Speaker 1>snake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The preposition to tells us the snake is</v>

20
00:00:58.391 --> 00:01:00.580
<v Speaker 1>the indirect object receiving the </v>
<v Speaker 1>action.</v>

21
00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:02.853
<v Speaker 1>But in many languages,</v>
<v Speaker 1>word order and prepositions are not the </v>

22
00:01:04.961 --> 00:01:06.850
<v Speaker 1>main ways to show the function of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

23
00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:07.803
<v Speaker 1>the form of the now might change or a </v>
<v Speaker 1>special ending might be added to the </v>

24
00:01:10.511 --> 00:01:12.340
<v Speaker 1>word to show what's function in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>sentence.</v>

25
00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:13.263
<v Speaker 1>In English,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we do this to show possession like in </v>

26
00:01:14.831 --> 00:01:15.664
<v Speaker 1>the phrase the Lions defeat the </v>
<v Speaker 1>apostrophe s shows that the defeat </v>

27
00:01:19.151 --> 00:01:23.320
<v Speaker 1>belongs to the lion and in English we </v>
<v Speaker 1>also have pronouns that changed for form</v>

28
00:01:23.321 --> 00:01:25.480
<v Speaker 1>to show grammatical case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

29
00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:27.490
<v Speaker 1>I robbed her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she robbed me,</v>

30
00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:32.260
<v Speaker 1>I and she or the subject forms while me </v>
<v Speaker 1>and her are the object forms,</v>

31
00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:33.273
<v Speaker 1>but there are languages that show </v>
<v Speaker 1>grammatical case much more than English </v>

32
00:01:35.441 --> 00:01:35.920
<v Speaker 1>does.</v>

33
00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.920
<v Speaker 1>The most common grammatical cases are </v>
<v Speaker 1>probably nominative,</v>

34
00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:39.783
<v Speaker 1>accusative and genitive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nominative case generally indicates the </v>

35
00:01:42.641 --> 00:01:43.474
<v Speaker 1>subject of a sentence which often means </v>
<v Speaker 1>the person or thing doing the action </v>

36
00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:52.020
<v Speaker 1>like this and Arabic acolyte walla due </v>
<v Speaker 1>to fatten meaning the boy ate an apple.</v>

37
00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:53.223
<v Speaker 1>Here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can see that the word for boy </v>

38
00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:55.073
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] has an e at the end because </v>
<v Speaker 1>it is the subject of the sentence and </v>

39
00:01:58.661 --> 00:02:02.740
<v Speaker 1>nominative case can also indicate the </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing that the subject is equivalent to.</v>

40
00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:06.310
<v Speaker 1>So in this sentence who are telling me </v>
<v Speaker 1>soon hear the word for student.</v>

41
00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:07.203
<v Speaker 1>Tilimeers has wound at the end to </v>
<v Speaker 1>indicate nominative case because it is </v>

42
00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:13.900
<v Speaker 1>equal to the subject.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This ending has the extra n sound at the</v>

43
00:02:13.901 --> 00:02:14.734
<v Speaker 1>end because it's indefinite.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These kinds of changes to the form of a </v>

44
00:02:17.741 --> 00:02:20.620
<v Speaker 1>word to show grammatical difference are </v>
<v Speaker 1>called inflections.</v>

45
00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:25.120
<v Speaker 1>Accusative case generally indicates that</v>
<v Speaker 1>direct object of a verb in Arabic,</v>

46
00:02:25.121 --> 00:02:27.070
<v Speaker 1>it has that use along with some other </v>
<v Speaker 1>uses.</v>

47
00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.993
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] which means I drink milk </v>

48
00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:34.420
<v Speaker 1>here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the word for milk Halib has an ah at the</v>

49
00:02:34.421 --> 00:02:38.350
<v Speaker 1>end to indicate that it's the direct </v>
<v Speaker 1>object or the accusative case.</v>

50
00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:39.453
<v Speaker 1>Genitive case generally indicates that </v>
<v Speaker 1>one noun is being modified by another </v>

51
00:02:42.671 --> 00:02:43.504
<v Speaker 1>one often to show possession.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We dotty [inaudible] meaning the boys </v>

52
00:02:47.381 --> 00:02:48.214
<v Speaker 1>teacher here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The word for boy wallet has an e sound </v>

53
00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:51.693
<v Speaker 1>at the end to show possession.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are probably the three cases </v>

54
00:02:55.061 --> 00:02:57.820
<v Speaker 1>you're most likely to run into,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but depending on the language,</v>

55
00:02:57.821 --> 00:02:59.680
<v Speaker 1>there are numerous other cases.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

56
00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:03.400
<v Speaker 1>the date of case is generally used for a</v>
<v Speaker 1>noun which receives something.</v>

57
00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:04.263
<v Speaker 1>Something moves towards that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now [inaudible] I didn't give the girl </v>

58
00:03:09.581 --> 00:03:13.420
<v Speaker 1>money here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Latin word for girl who in La has an</v>

59
00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:14.283
<v Speaker 1>e at the end to indicate that she is the</v>
<v Speaker 1>indirect object on the receiving end of </v>

60
00:03:17.651 --> 00:03:18.484
<v Speaker 1>an action.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Locative case is used to indicate a </v>

61
00:03:21.101 --> 00:03:21.934
<v Speaker 1>location.</v>

62
00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:25.290
<v Speaker 1>Here's an example from Turkish Fda Beer </v>
<v Speaker 1>Kita aqua doom,</v>

63
00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:30.550
<v Speaker 1>which means I read a book at home,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hear the word for HouseF has dead at the</v>

64
00:03:30.551 --> 00:03:33.700
<v Speaker 1>end to show that it's the location where</v>
<v Speaker 1>the reading took place.</v>

65
00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:35.043
<v Speaker 1>In English,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we use a separate preposition like at </v>

66
00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:39.940
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] or on to show location </v>
<v Speaker 1>rather than a case inflection.</v>

67
00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:41.103
<v Speaker 1>Instrumental case is used for announced </v>
<v Speaker 1>that is used as a tool or a means of </v>

68
00:03:44.171 --> 00:03:45.004
<v Speaker 1>completing an action.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's an example from Polish p shapew </v>

69
00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:50.020
<v Speaker 1>with them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which means I write with a pen,</v>

70
00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:53.440
<v Speaker 1>the word for pen people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It all ends with the final,</v>

71
00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:54.303
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which has replaced by e m because it's </v>

72
00:03:56.411 --> 00:03:59.290
<v Speaker 1>the instrument being used to carry out </v>
<v Speaker 1>the action of writing.</v>

73
00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:00.543
<v Speaker 1>Notice that because of that ending,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was no need to add a standalone </v>

74
00:04:03.101 --> 00:04:03.934
<v Speaker 1>preposition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning with those are some of the most </v>

75
00:04:05.741 --> 00:04:06.574
<v Speaker 1>common cases.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The main thing to keep in mind is that </v>

76
00:04:08.021 --> 00:04:12.010
<v Speaker 1>the form of the now or of the Pronoun </v>
<v Speaker 1>changes depending on its function in the</v>

77
00:04:12.011 --> 00:04:12.844
<v Speaker 1>sentence.</v>

78
00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:15.220
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes cases apply not only to </v>
<v Speaker 1>announce,</v>

79
00:04:15.221 --> 00:04:18.850
<v Speaker 1>but also to words that are connected to </v>
<v Speaker 1>them like adjectives and articles.</v>

80
00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:22.060
<v Speaker 1>Here's an example of an adjective being </v>
<v Speaker 1>inflicted for case.</v>

81
00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:25.120
<v Speaker 1>This time again in Arabic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll have been to Al Jameela too,</v>

82
00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:26.133
<v Speaker 1>which means the beautiful girl here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Noun for girl didn't has the </v>

83
00:04:29.681 --> 00:04:33.010
<v Speaker 1>nominative case ending and so does the </v>
<v Speaker 1>adjective Jameela,</v>

84
00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:34.113
<v Speaker 1>but the Arabic equivalent of h at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>end of the word changes to a t sound </v>

85
00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:41.320
<v Speaker 1>before the case nd.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And here's an example of articles taking</v>

86
00:04:41.321 --> 00:04:43.600
<v Speaker 1>case inflection.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This time from old English,</v>

87
00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:45.220
<v Speaker 1>say Kooning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the king.</v>

88
00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:47.720
<v Speaker 1>In nominative case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the genitive case,</v>

89
00:04:47.721 --> 00:04:48.554
<v Speaker 1>it's fast schooning gis salt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Noun is inflected with the genitive </v>

90
00:04:50.981 --> 00:04:51.814
<v Speaker 1>ending.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the definite article also has a </v>

91
00:04:53.081 --> 00:04:53.914
<v Speaker 1>special form in the genitive case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>words have particular functions in all </v>

92
00:04:57.881 --> 00:04:58.714
<v Speaker 1>languages of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but only in certain languages do they </v>

93
00:05:00.461 --> 00:05:01.294
<v Speaker 1>commonly indicate these functions with </v>
<v Speaker 1>changes to the form of the work when </v>

94
00:05:04.811 --> 00:05:06.190
<v Speaker 1>talking about languages that do.</v>

95
00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:09.400
<v Speaker 1>So we often talk about now in cases or </v>
<v Speaker 1>case endings,</v>

96
00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:12.550
<v Speaker 1>but remember that not only nouns can be </v>
<v Speaker 1>inflicted for case,</v>

97
00:05:12.551 --> 00:05:13.384
<v Speaker 1>but also pronouns,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which represent nouns and also </v>

98
00:05:15.881 --> 00:05:19.450
<v Speaker 1>adjectives which modify,</v>
<v Speaker 1>announce and articles which show whether</v>

99
00:05:19.451 --> 00:05:20.284
<v Speaker 1>nouns or definite or indefinite.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hope that was a helpful summary for </v>

100
00:05:23.171 --> 00:05:26.740
<v Speaker 1>anyone who needed clarification.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the quick question of the day,</v>

101
00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:27.723
<v Speaker 1>do words in your language change form </v>
<v Speaker 1>depending on their function in the </v>

102
00:05:30.341 --> 00:05:32.200
<v Speaker 1>sentence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you can think of an example,</v>

103
00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:35.080
<v Speaker 1>let us know in the comments down below.</v>
