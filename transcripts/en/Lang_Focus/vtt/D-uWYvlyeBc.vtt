00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.260
<v Speaker 1>Hey Paul,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when are you going to finish?</v>

2
00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:02.273
<v Speaker 1>What do you mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>When are you going to finish talking </v>

3
00:00:03.391 --> 00:00:04.680
<v Speaker 1>about I talky?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

4
00:00:04.681 --> 00:00:06.060
<v Speaker 1>I'm already finished.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

5
00:00:06.061 --> 00:00:06.894
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because you have a language video to </v>

6
00:00:07.771 --> 00:00:08.521
<v Speaker 1>make.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

7
00:00:08.521 --> 00:00:10.940
<v Speaker 1>that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What language does it today finish?</v>

8
00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:11.700
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

9
00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.700
<v Speaker 1>I'm finished.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hello everyone.</v>

10
00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:21.210
<v Speaker 1>Welcome to the Lange Focus Channel and </v>
<v Speaker 1>my name is Paul.</v>

11
00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:24.420
<v Speaker 1>Today I'm going to talk about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Finnish language.</v>

12
00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:25.613
<v Speaker 1>As you probably know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>finish is the majority language spoken </v>

13
00:00:27.661 --> 00:00:29.880
<v Speaker 1>in Finland.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has about 5.4</v>

14
00:00:29.881 --> 00:00:33.840
<v Speaker 1>million native speakers with 4.9</v>
<v Speaker 1>million of them living in Finland,</v>

15
00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.510
<v Speaker 1>which is about 90% of the population of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Finland.</v>

16
00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.140
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the two official languages </v>
<v Speaker 1>of Finland along with Swedish,</v>

17
00:00:40.141 --> 00:00:40.974
<v Speaker 1>which is spoken by about 5% of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>population and there were also finished </v>

18
00:00:43.861 --> 00:00:46.200
<v Speaker 1>speaking minorities across the border in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Russia,</v>

19
00:00:46.201 --> 00:00:47.034
<v Speaker 1>in Norway and in Sweden.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You may have seen my video on the north </v>

20
00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:50.550
<v Speaker 1>dramatic languages.</v>

21
00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:51.383
<v Speaker 1>It's this one right here and you might </v>
<v Speaker 1>remember that I specifically excluded </v>

22
00:00:54.931 --> 00:00:55.764
<v Speaker 1>finish from that video.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's because even though Finland is a </v>

23
00:00:58.411 --> 00:01:02.430
<v Speaker 1>Nordic country with geographic and </v>
<v Speaker 1>historical connections to Scandinavia,</v>

24
00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:05.730
<v Speaker 1>the Finnish language is not an north </v>
<v Speaker 1>Germanic language.</v>

25
00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.190
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not even an Indo European language.</v>

26
00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.500
<v Speaker 1>It is part of the Finnish language </v>
<v Speaker 1>group,</v>

27
00:01:10.501 --> 00:01:12.780
<v Speaker 1>which is a branch of the urologic </v>
<v Speaker 1>language family.</v>

28
00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.900
<v Speaker 1>Other members of the finet group,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our Estonian Cornellian,</v>

29
00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.020
<v Speaker 1>Ludic Vips,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ingredient votech and Livonians,</v>

30
00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.710
<v Speaker 1>but finish is the most widely spoken </v>
<v Speaker 1>language in the Finnish language group.</v>

31
00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.560
<v Speaker 1>All the Finnick languages developed from</v>
<v Speaker 1>Prodo Finnick,</v>

32
00:01:25.561 --> 00:01:30.060
<v Speaker 1>which was spoken around 3000 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first stage was early Prodo Finnick.</v>

33
00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.280
<v Speaker 1>Then during the middle protal finnick </v>
<v Speaker 1>period,</v>

34
00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.780
<v Speaker 1>some changes took place in that language</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's split into two protos Samak,</v>

35
00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.380
<v Speaker 1>the ancestor of the Cemak languages and </v>
<v Speaker 1>late Prodo Finnick,</v>

36
00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:44.520
<v Speaker 1>which ultimately became the most recent </v>
<v Speaker 1>ancestor of all the Finnick languages.</v>

37
00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:45.383
<v Speaker 1>It's worth noting that finished contains</v>
<v Speaker 1>a significant number of Germanic loan </v>

38
00:01:48.391 --> 00:01:49.224
<v Speaker 1>words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of them which are clearly ancient </v>

39
00:01:50.521 --> 00:01:52.230
<v Speaker 1>in origin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

40
00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.630
<v Speaker 1>kooning gas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which means king do lead,</v>

41
00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:57.690
<v Speaker 1>which means chair,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it comes from the same root as stool</v>

42
00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:58.613
<v Speaker 1>and gold loops,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which means school from words like </v>

43
00:02:01.141 --> 00:02:01.974
<v Speaker 1>these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can see that the ancient fins had </v>

44
00:02:03.061 --> 00:02:07.710
<v Speaker 1>extensive contact with Germanic peoples.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Linked Prodo Finnick diverged into three</v>

45
00:02:07.711 --> 00:02:09.300
<v Speaker 1>dialects,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eastern Prodo,</v>

46
00:02:09.301 --> 00:02:10.620
<v Speaker 1>Finnick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>northern Prodo,</v>

47
00:02:10.621 --> 00:02:11.454
<v Speaker 1>Finnick and southern Prodo Finnick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These three dialects of Lake Prodo </v>

48
00:02:14.431 --> 00:02:15.264
<v Speaker 1>finnick mixed with each other and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>resulting mixes of influences developed </v>

49
00:02:18.541 --> 00:02:21.030
<v Speaker 1>into the dialects that make up the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Finnish language.</v>

50
00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:22.043
<v Speaker 1>Around the 12th Century and 13th century</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ce Sweden conquered Finland and made it </v>

51
00:02:25.891 --> 00:02:28.680
<v Speaker 1>a province of their country and for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>next few hundred years,</v>

52
00:02:28.681 --> 00:02:29.514
<v Speaker 1>Swedish was the language of </v>
<v Speaker 1>administration and during this time the </v>

53
00:02:31.721 --> 00:02:32.554
<v Speaker 1>middle low German was the Lingua Franca </v>
<v Speaker 1>of commerce in the area and Latin was </v>

54
00:02:36.121 --> 00:02:37.230
<v Speaker 1>the language of religion.</v>

55
00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:38.183
<v Speaker 1>Swedish and middle low German left an </v>
<v Speaker 1>additional dramatic influence on </v>

56
00:02:41.041 --> 00:02:41.874
<v Speaker 1>finished,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which during that time was strictly a </v>

57
00:02:43.231 --> 00:02:46.500
<v Speaker 1>language of daily communication.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Finished did not really become a written</v>

58
00:02:46.501 --> 00:02:47.334
<v Speaker 1>language until the 16th century.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When a finished bishop named Mikael </v>

59
00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:54.060
<v Speaker 1>Agricola created the first comprehensive</v>
<v Speaker 1>writing system for the language.</v>

60
00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.430
<v Speaker 1>He based that system on the orthography </v>
<v Speaker 1>of German,</v>

61
00:02:56.431 --> 00:02:57.420
<v Speaker 1>Swedish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Latin,</v>

62
00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:00.190
<v Speaker 1>and it still forms the basis of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>finished writing system today,</v>

63
00:03:00.191 --> 00:03:01.870
<v Speaker 1>although there have been changes since </v>
<v Speaker 1>then.</v>

64
00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:02.793
<v Speaker 1>In 1809 Russia seized Finland from </v>
<v Speaker 1>Sweden in a war and made it an </v>

65
00:03:06.131 --> 00:03:08.530
<v Speaker 1>autonomous state as part of the Russian </v>
<v Speaker 1>empire.</v>

66
00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:12.190
<v Speaker 1>The official language and the language </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the elite remained Swedish,</v>

67
00:03:12.191 --> 00:03:13.024
<v Speaker 1>but finished national feeling and a </v>
<v Speaker 1>desire to make the Finnish language </v>

68
00:03:15.641 --> 00:03:16.474
<v Speaker 1>dominant began to increase in 1835 these</v>
<v Speaker 1>feelings were amplified by the </v>

69
00:03:19.961 --> 00:03:20.794
<v Speaker 1>publication of culliver law or work of </v>
<v Speaker 1>epic poetry written by alias Loon </v>

70
00:03:24.101 --> 00:03:27.670
<v Speaker 1>wrought with stories from carilion and </v>
<v Speaker 1>finish folklore and mythology.</v>

71
00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:28.853
<v Speaker 1>Luna [inaudible] also played an </v>
<v Speaker 1>important role in the development of </v>

72
00:03:30.791 --> 00:03:31.624
<v Speaker 1>standard finish in 1863 finish became an</v>
<v Speaker 1>official language in Finland alongside </v>

73
00:03:36.371 --> 00:03:40.030
<v Speaker 1>the Swedish language and they both </v>
<v Speaker 1>remain official languages today and with</v>

74
00:03:40.031 --> 00:03:40.864
<v Speaker 1>a new sense of national identity </v>
<v Speaker 1>emerging Finland eventually gained </v>

75
00:03:43.571 --> 00:03:47.770
<v Speaker 1>independence from Russia in 1917 before </v>
<v Speaker 1>standard finish was created.</v>

76
00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:51.280
<v Speaker 1>The Finnish language consisted of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>number of dialects that could be roughly</v>

77
00:03:51.281 --> 00:03:53.770
<v Speaker 1>divided into eastern and western </v>
<v Speaker 1>dialects.</v>

78
00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:58.030
<v Speaker 1>The Western dialects are the ones upon </v>
<v Speaker 1>which standard finish was largely based.</v>

79
00:03:58.090 --> 00:03:58.923
<v Speaker 1>From what I understand these days,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the dialects mostly consist of </v>

80
00:04:00.971 --> 00:04:01.804
<v Speaker 1>differences in accent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but outside of Finland there are a few </v>

81
00:04:04.151 --> 00:04:04.984
<v Speaker 1>interesting dialects that are officially</v>
<v Speaker 1>considered to be different languages </v>

82
00:04:07.751 --> 00:04:10.210
<v Speaker 1>even though they are intelligible with </v>
<v Speaker 1>standard finish.</v>

83
00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:13.200
<v Speaker 1>This includes the Corelli in language </v>
<v Speaker 1>and Russia may Anchia Lee,</v>

84
00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:16.630
<v Speaker 1>which is spoken by a Finnish minority </v>
<v Speaker 1>and Sweden and Kevin,</v>

85
00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:18.640
<v Speaker 1>which is spoken by a minority in Norway.</v>

86
00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:22.510
<v Speaker 1>So what is the Finnish language like?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

87
00:04:22.511 --> 00:04:25.870
<v Speaker 1>it shares some features with the other </v>
<v Speaker 1>members of the Finnish language group.</v>

88
00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:28.480
<v Speaker 1>Some of those features are no </v>
<v Speaker 1>grammatical gender.</v>

89
00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:30.640
<v Speaker 1>There was no distinction between </v>
<v Speaker 1>masculine,</v>

90
00:04:30.641 --> 00:04:33.970
<v Speaker 1>feminine or Neuter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not even in the personal pronouns.</v>

91
00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:36.160
<v Speaker 1>Hum.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It means both he and she,</v>

92
00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:37.263
<v Speaker 1>and interestingly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Finland was one of the first countries </v>

93
00:04:38.621 --> 00:04:39.454
<v Speaker 1>to grant women the right to vote and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>was one of the first to have a female </v>

94
00:04:42.011 --> 00:04:42.844
<v Speaker 1>president.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So maybe gender equality is just built </v>

95
00:04:44.981 --> 00:04:47.290
<v Speaker 1>into the language and way of thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

96
00:04:47.291 --> 00:04:49.780
<v Speaker 1>you never know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Next no articles.</v>

97
00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:52.480
<v Speaker 1>Articles are the words like [inaudible] </v>
<v Speaker 1>or the in English.</v>

98
00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:56.080
<v Speaker 1>English speakers often wonder how you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can communicate without those articles,</v>

99
00:04:56.081 --> 00:04:59.410
<v Speaker 1>but the context usually provides enough </v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning that you don't actually need the</v>

100
00:04:59.411 --> 00:05:00.244
<v Speaker 1>articles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Next finish has some prepositions in </v>

101
00:05:02.801 --> 00:05:03.634
<v Speaker 1>English.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are words showing location or </v>

102
00:05:04.661 --> 00:05:09.661
<v Speaker 1>relationship like two or apps or on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but finish has many more post positions.</v>

103
00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:12.160
<v Speaker 1>These are similar to prepositions in </v>
<v Speaker 1>function,</v>

104
00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:15.940
<v Speaker 1>but they come after the word that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>add meaning to rather than before.</v>

105
00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:19.570
<v Speaker 1>Here's an example sentence with the post</v>
<v Speaker 1>position already on Coppola.</v>

106
00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:20.433
<v Speaker 1>Guess Scala.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The sentence means the market is in the </v>

107
00:05:22.391 --> 00:05:23.224
<v Speaker 1>center of town.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Toady means market on is similar to his </v>

108
00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:30.760
<v Speaker 1>Kalpa me is town.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The end at the end of [inaudible] is the</v>

109
00:05:30.761 --> 00:05:31.594
<v Speaker 1>genitive case showing possession and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then after Kelp lumion we have </v>

110
00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:37.450
<v Speaker 1>cascadilla which is the post position,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which means in the middle,</v>

111
00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:41.320
<v Speaker 1>so it's supposed to position because it </v>
<v Speaker 1>comes after the now Kalpa me next,</v>

112
00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:44.350
<v Speaker 1>lots of grammatical cases,</v>
<v Speaker 1>15 to be precise.</v>

113
00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:45.393
<v Speaker 1>That means that now it's personal </v>
<v Speaker 1>pronouns and adjectives have 15 </v>

114
00:05:47.531 --> 00:05:50.110
<v Speaker 1>different forms depending on their </v>
<v Speaker 1>function in the sentence.</v>

115
00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:53.200
<v Speaker 1>We can't look at all 15 right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but let's look at an example.</v>

116
00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:54.123
<v Speaker 1>Finish has the accusative case which </v>
<v Speaker 1>marks a direct object and that's common </v>

117
00:05:57.891 --> 00:05:58.790
<v Speaker 1>in lots of languages.</v>

118
00:05:58.940 --> 00:05:59.773
<v Speaker 1>It can be shown with an end at the end </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the word or it can be shown with </v>

119
00:06:02.751 --> 00:06:04.730
<v Speaker 1>nothing just left blank at the end of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the word,</v>

120
00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:07.190
<v Speaker 1>but there is also something called the </v>
<v Speaker 1>positive case.</v>

121
00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:11.810
<v Speaker 1>This also marks a direct object.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If the object is only part of a whole or</v>

122
00:06:11.811 --> 00:06:15.710
<v Speaker 1>if the action is incomplete or if the </v>
<v Speaker 1>action is negative shift,</v>

123
00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:20.300
<v Speaker 1>go call on this sentence means will you </v>
<v Speaker 1>eat the fish should means you eat.</v>

124
00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:21.620
<v Speaker 1>Cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's a question.</v>

125
00:06:21.621 --> 00:06:22.454
<v Speaker 1>Marker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Color is fish and the end at the end of </v>

126
00:06:24.681 --> 00:06:25.514
<v Speaker 1>color is the accusative case showing </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the action will be completed and </v>

127
00:06:28.311 --> 00:06:32.510
<v Speaker 1>that the whole fish will be eaten.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just cacala means do you eat fish?</v>

128
00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:34.190
<v Speaker 1>So again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shoot is you eat,</v>

129
00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:35.660
<v Speaker 1>cook,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the question marker.</v>

130
00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:36.733
<v Speaker 1>Color is fish and the [inaudible] at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>end of color is the positive case which </v>

131
00:06:40.431 --> 00:06:42.470
<v Speaker 1>shows that there's no completed action.</v>

132
00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:46.220
<v Speaker 1>There's no completed action because </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no specific fish being eaten.</v>

133
00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:48.440
<v Speaker 1>This is just a general question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Next,</v>

134
00:06:48.530 --> 00:06:51.830
<v Speaker 1>you may have noticed in the above </v>
<v Speaker 1>example sentences that the present tense</v>

135
00:06:51.831 --> 00:06:54.730
<v Speaker 1>and future tense are the same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's right in finished.</v>

136
00:06:54.731 --> 00:06:55.564
<v Speaker 1>There is no future tense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the future can be indicated in a </v>

137
00:06:58.131 --> 00:06:58.964
<v Speaker 1>couple of ways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you see a present tense verb with </v>

138
00:07:00.731 --> 00:07:01.564
<v Speaker 1>an accusative case object like this that</v>
<v Speaker 1>indicates the future because it shows </v>

139
00:07:05.361 --> 00:07:07.550
<v Speaker 1>that the action will be complete at some</v>
<v Speaker 1>point.</v>

140
00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.330
<v Speaker 1>When you see a present tense verb with </v>
<v Speaker 1>the part of the case like this,</v>

141
00:07:11.690 --> 00:07:15.350
<v Speaker 1>that indicates present tense because the</v>
<v Speaker 1>action is not a completed action,</v>

142
00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:16.213
<v Speaker 1>so what must be happening now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The future can also be clarified with a </v>

143
00:07:19.011 --> 00:07:19.844
<v Speaker 1>time expression.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's an example of demonstrating that </v>

144
00:07:21.801 --> 00:07:24.080
<v Speaker 1>there is no future tense in Finnish </v>
<v Speaker 1>fluid.</v>

145
00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:26.990
<v Speaker 1>This means I read one woman.</v>

146
00:07:27.470 --> 00:07:30.850
<v Speaker 1>This means I will read to moral who am </v>
<v Speaker 1>in not means tomorrow,</v>

147
00:07:31.010 --> 00:07:31.843
<v Speaker 1>and that time expression is what </v>
<v Speaker 1>indicates that this action will take </v>

148
00:07:34.041 --> 00:07:35.480
<v Speaker 1>place in the future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Next,</v>

149
00:07:35.780 --> 00:07:36.613
<v Speaker 1>there are a lot of long words and finish</v>
<v Speaker 1>because of a gluten nation and because </v>

150
00:07:39.231 --> 00:07:42.200
<v Speaker 1>of compound words finishes in a gluten </v>
<v Speaker 1>native language,</v>

151
00:07:42.230 --> 00:07:43.063
<v Speaker 1>meaning that words can be formed by </v>
<v Speaker 1>attaching together pieces that add </v>

152
00:07:45.621 --> 00:07:48.290
<v Speaker 1>meaning to the word.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Without those pieces changing,</v>

153
00:07:48.410 --> 00:07:49.243
<v Speaker 1>you just attach them together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In English we might use separate words </v>

154
00:07:51.711 --> 00:07:52.544
<v Speaker 1>like conjunctions and prepositions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in finished special endings can be </v>

155
00:07:55.401 --> 00:07:58.610
<v Speaker 1>added to a word stem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's an example starting with the word</v>

156
00:07:58.611 --> 00:07:59.444
<v Speaker 1>for house.</v>

157
00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:01.590
<v Speaker 2>Hello.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hello Sir.</v>

158
00:08:02.990 --> 00:08:05.900
<v Speaker 2>Hello,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is sonny boy's soon again.</v>

159
00:08:06.630 --> 00:08:07.590
<v Speaker 2>Hello.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So Nikki go</v>

160
00:08:09.930 --> 00:08:11.730
<v Speaker 1>and the few additional features of </v>
<v Speaker 1>finish.</v>

161
00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.490
<v Speaker 1>Number one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the main stress always goes on the first</v>

162
00:08:14.491 --> 00:08:16.440
<v Speaker 1>syllable of the word.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Number two,</v>

163
00:08:16.441 --> 00:08:19.380
<v Speaker 1>there was no equivalent of the verb to </v>
<v Speaker 1>have in finish.</v>

164
00:08:19.590 --> 00:08:22.170
<v Speaker 1>Number three finish has negative verb </v>
<v Speaker 1>conjugations.</v>

165
00:08:22.171 --> 00:08:25.260
<v Speaker 1>That means that instead of using a </v>
<v Speaker 1>negation word like not,</v>

166
00:08:25.410 --> 00:08:28.740
<v Speaker 1>it has an entirely different form of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>verb to show that it's negative.</v>

167
00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:29.673
<v Speaker 1>Finish is clearly a very interesting </v>
<v Speaker 1>language that might be quite different </v>

168
00:08:32.041 --> 00:08:34.290
<v Speaker 1>from the languages that you're used to </v>
<v Speaker 1>speaking and learning.</v>

169
00:08:34.380 --> 00:08:36.750
<v Speaker 1>But it's finished as hard to learn as </v>
<v Speaker 1>people say it is.</v>

170
00:08:36.810 --> 00:08:37.643
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't tell you from personal </v>

171
00:08:38.161 --> 00:08:38.994
<v Speaker 1>experience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it seems to me that if you've never </v>

172
00:08:40.171 --> 00:08:41.004
<v Speaker 1>learned a language from the finet group,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're from the your relic language </v>

173
00:08:43.231 --> 00:08:44.064
<v Speaker 1>family before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you'll probably have to bend your </v>

174
00:08:45.751 --> 00:08:49.410
<v Speaker 1>mind a little bit to understand how that</v>
<v Speaker 1>language works and that'll probably take</v>

175
00:08:49.411 --> 00:08:50.244
<v Speaker 1>more focus and effort then learning a </v>
<v Speaker 1>language that's more similar to your </v>

176
00:08:52.741 --> 00:08:54.570
<v Speaker 1>own,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but as is always the case,</v>

177
00:08:54.571 --> 00:08:55.404
<v Speaker 1>your passion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>any language or culture will carry you </v>

178
00:08:56.941 --> 00:08:58.890
<v Speaker 1>through the challenges of learning that </v>
<v Speaker 1>language.</v>

179
00:08:58.891 --> 00:09:01.770
<v Speaker 1>So if you're fascinated by finished,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you really should go for it.</v>

180
00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:02.813
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The question of the day for finished </v>

181
00:09:03.751 --> 00:09:04.584
<v Speaker 1>speakers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how noticeable or the finished dialects </v>

182
00:09:06.061 --> 00:09:06.894
<v Speaker 1>today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can you tell where a finished speaker </v>

183
00:09:07.981 --> 00:09:08.814
<v Speaker 1>was from just by hearing them speak and </v>
<v Speaker 1>a different question for people who've </v>

184
00:09:11.391 --> 00:09:14.040
<v Speaker 1>studied finish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how challenging is finished to learn?</v>

185
00:09:14.041 --> 00:09:16.620
<v Speaker 1>Did you find it quite tough or did you </v>
<v Speaker 1>just find it different?</v>

186
00:09:16.740 --> 00:09:17.573
<v Speaker 1>Let us know in the comments down below.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thanks again to all my patrion </v>

187
00:09:20.371 --> 00:09:22.890
<v Speaker 1>supporters for your continued support </v>
<v Speaker 1>and everyone else.</v>
