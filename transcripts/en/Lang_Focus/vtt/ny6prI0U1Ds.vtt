1
00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:07.213
<v Speaker 1>Nope.</v>

2
00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:17.000
<v Speaker 2>Hello everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Welcome to the Lange focus channel.</v>

3
00:00:17.001 --> 00:00:18.710
<v Speaker 2>My name is Paul.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thank you for tuning in.</v>

4
00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.843
<v Speaker 2>Today we're going to talk about some </v>
<v Speaker 2>famous people who can't speak a foreign </v>

5
00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:23.863
<v Speaker 2>language.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When we think of famous people are </v>

6
00:00:25.521 --> 00:00:28.340
<v Speaker 2>iconic people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the image in mind that we have of them,</v>

7
00:00:28.341 --> 00:00:30.950
<v Speaker 2>it's usually just a very thin slice of </v>
<v Speaker 2>who they are.</v>

8
00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:34.400
<v Speaker 2>We know the skills and the talents that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they choose to share with the public,</v>

9
00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:37.640
<v Speaker 2>but there are always other things about </v>
<v Speaker 2>them that we don't know and that most of</v>

10
00:00:37.641 --> 00:00:38.474
<v Speaker 2>us would find surprising.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of us would be surprised to know </v>

11
00:00:41.091 --> 00:00:41.924
<v Speaker 2>that one of the famous celebrities that </v>
<v Speaker 2>we look up to can speak a foreign </v>

12
00:00:45.081 --> 00:00:48.530
<v Speaker 2>language.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

13
00:00:48.531 --> 00:00:51.650
<v Speaker 2>there are some famous celebrities who </v>
<v Speaker 2>grew up speaking foreign languages.</v>

14
00:00:51.651 --> 00:00:52.484
<v Speaker 2>For example.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

15
00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:56.560
<v Speaker 2>Natalie Portman was born in Jerusalem </v>
<v Speaker 2>and she is fluent in Hebrew.</v>

16
00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:57.863
<v Speaker 3>Good.</v>

17
00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:03.003
<v Speaker 2>And Leonardo Dicaprio speaks German </v>
<v Speaker 2>because his family on his mother's side </v>

18
00:01:05.981 --> 00:01:07.770
<v Speaker 2>is from Germany,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not mine,</v>

19
00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:10.570
<v Speaker 2>almost from a [inaudible],</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

20
00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:13.350
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>switched him to Vec from Dusseldorf.</v>

21
00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:14.423
<v Speaker 2>But there are also lots of famous people</v>
<v Speaker 2>who have learned foreign languages as </v>

22
00:01:17.641 --> 00:01:18.474
<v Speaker 2>teens or adults.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One example is will Smith who speak </v>

23
00:01:21.251 --> 00:01:22.680
<v Speaker 2>Spanish?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's have a look.</v>

24
00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:24.990
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

25
00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:29.370
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

26
00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:34.380
<v Speaker 4>and up to two zero k and this is </v>
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible].</v>

27
00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:36.173
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so maybe we'll smith doesn't seem </v>

28
00:01:37.501 --> 00:01:39.630
<v Speaker 2>completely fluent in Spanish,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's all right.</v>

29
00:01:39.631 --> 00:01:42.600
<v Speaker 2>He seems to have the basics down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He has a working knowledge of Spanish.</v>

30
00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:43.643
<v Speaker 2>He is on record as saying that he </v>
<v Speaker 2>studies Spanish in order to do </v>

31
00:01:47.101 --> 00:01:50.580
<v Speaker 2>interviews for his fans around the world</v>
<v Speaker 2>who speak Spanish.</v>

32
00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:51.563
<v Speaker 2>I think the lesson we can take from will</v>
<v Speaker 2>smith is that having a very specific </v>

33
00:01:54.811 --> 00:01:57.030
<v Speaker 2>functional goal in mind for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>language,</v>

34
00:01:57.031 --> 00:01:57.864
<v Speaker 2>having a real functional reason to use </v>
<v Speaker 2>the language is a great external </v>

35
00:02:00.991 --> 00:02:01.824
<v Speaker 2>motivator to study it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe he doesn't have a personal </v>

36
00:02:04.261 --> 00:02:05.094
<v Speaker 2>cultural interest in studying Spanish,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that professional goal of giving </v>

37
00:02:08.431 --> 00:02:12.060
<v Speaker 2>interviews in Spanish motivates him to </v>
<v Speaker 2>study and he's constantly improving.</v>

38
00:02:12.061 --> 00:02:15.510
<v Speaker 2>So I think it's working.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Another person is Bradley Cooper who was</v>

39
00:02:15.511 --> 00:02:17.640
<v Speaker 2>fluent in French.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's take a look.</v>

40
00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:20.050
<v Speaker 5>Mia,</v>
<v Speaker 5>CBL plumbism he posted,</v>

41
00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:24.040
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>sit by me buck to us.</v>

42
00:02:24.041 --> 00:02:24.874
<v Speaker 5>It didn't new laws,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they've got more superpose you have a </v>

43
00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:28.740
<v Speaker 5>bubble set us up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>[inaudible]</v>

44
00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:30.083
<v Speaker 2>now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bradley Cooper clearly speaks French </v>

45
00:02:31.171 --> 00:02:32.004
<v Speaker 2>very well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He often gives interviews in the French </v>

46
00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:34.650
<v Speaker 2>Press,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the French media.</v>

47
00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:38.100
<v Speaker 2>He says that he studied abroad in France</v>
<v Speaker 2>when he was a teenager.</v>

48
00:02:38.101 --> 00:02:38.934
<v Speaker 2>He lived there for six months and was </v>
<v Speaker 2>basically immersed in the French </v>

49
00:02:41.941 --> 00:02:42.774
<v Speaker 2>language.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think the lesson that we can take </v>

50
00:02:44.191 --> 00:02:45.024
<v Speaker 2>from Bradley Cooper is that living in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the country where that language is </v>

51
00:02:48.451 --> 00:02:49.284
<v Speaker 2>spoken,</v>
<v Speaker 2>living amongst people who speak it with </v>

52
00:02:50.821 --> 00:02:51.654
<v Speaker 2>you everyday,</v>
<v Speaker 2>being immersed is one of the best ways </v>

53
00:02:53.761 --> 00:02:56.130
<v Speaker 2>that you can solidify your language </v>
<v Speaker 2>skills.</v>

54
00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:59.950
<v Speaker 2>Another person is Gwyneth paltrow who </v>
<v Speaker 2>speaks fluent Spanish.</v>

55
00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:00.813
<v Speaker 2>Let's take a look</v>

56
00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:06.480
<v Speaker 6>[inaudible] job,</v>
<v Speaker 6>eh,</v>

57
00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:12.520
<v Speaker 6>we're not.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I own opportunity Spania as to the Rie.</v>

58
00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:13.733
<v Speaker 2>What does paltrow says that she went to </v>
<v Speaker 2>Mexico when she was a teenager and she </v>

59
00:03:16.811 --> 00:03:17.644
<v Speaker 2>fell in love with the country and she </v>
<v Speaker 2>started to study the language and that </v>

60
00:03:20.261 --> 00:03:22.900
<v Speaker 2>she's been back there on a regular basis</v>
<v Speaker 2>ever since then.</v>

61
00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:23.913
<v Speaker 2>And even to this day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she still speaks Spanish regularly and </v>

62
00:03:26.021 --> 00:03:28.810
<v Speaker 2>she says she even speak Spanish to her </v>
<v Speaker 2>kids sometimes.</v>

63
00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:29.943
<v Speaker 2>So I think what we can learn from her is</v>
<v Speaker 2>that really falling in love with a </v>

64
00:03:32.921 --> 00:03:33.754
<v Speaker 2>culture and making that culture a part </v>
<v Speaker 2>of your life and a part of who you are </v>

65
00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:37.623
<v Speaker 2>is a great way to also get motivated to </v>
<v Speaker 2>study that language and make the </v>

66
00:03:40.781 --> 00:03:43.750
<v Speaker 2>language a part of yourself and your </v>
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>

67
00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:46.510
<v Speaker 2>It's not really difficult to do that if </v>
<v Speaker 2>you love the culture,</v>

68
00:03:46.511 --> 00:03:47.344
<v Speaker 2>you don't even need to push yourself </v>
<v Speaker 2>because you'll always just enjoy </v>

69
00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:51.333
<v Speaker 2>studying that language and enjoy getting</v>
<v Speaker 2>to know the culture even more than you </v>

70
00:03:54.221 --> 00:03:57.280
<v Speaker 2>currently do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now the next person is not a movie star,</v>

71
00:03:57.281 --> 00:03:58.114
<v Speaker 2>not a Hollywood star,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but she's still very famous and you </v>

72
00:04:00.011 --> 00:04:02.350
<v Speaker 2>still know who she is and that's jk </v>
<v Speaker 2>rowling,</v>

73
00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:05.350
<v Speaker 2>who was the author of the Harry Potter </v>
<v Speaker 2>Series Of course,</v>

74
00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:09.550
<v Speaker 2>and she is filthy fucking rich.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jk Rowling,</v>

75
00:04:09.551 --> 00:04:11.710
<v Speaker 2>can't speak French,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's have a look.</v>

76
00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:12.843
<v Speaker 6>Good idea because you're pulling slam </v>
<v Speaker 6>every t [inaudible] apple in </v>

77
00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:20.470
<v Speaker 6>significance to particularly air it say </v>
<v Speaker 6>personnel.</v>

78
00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:22.880
<v Speaker 6>Constable explicate on stone.</v>

79
00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:24.253
<v Speaker 2>Jk Rowling majored in French in </v>
<v Speaker 2>university and part of her program was </v>

80
00:04:27.231 --> 00:04:28.064
<v Speaker 2>to spend a year abroad in Paris studying</v>
<v Speaker 2>the language and she was also a French </v>

81
00:04:32.391 --> 00:04:36.870
<v Speaker 2>teacher in the UK for a while before she</v>
<v Speaker 2>became filthy rich.</v>

82
00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:37.763
<v Speaker 2>So similar to Bradley Cooper.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the lesson that we can learn </v>

83
00:04:40.051 --> 00:04:40.884
<v Speaker 2>from jk rowling is that immersion in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>country will immersion amongst the </v>

84
00:04:44.311 --> 00:04:48.000
<v Speaker 2>language that you want to learn is one </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the best ways to solidify your skills</v>

85
00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:49.073
<v Speaker 2>and to become good at that language.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Another lesson that we can learn from </v>

86
00:04:52.111 --> 00:04:57.111
<v Speaker 2>her is that learning a foreign language </v>
<v Speaker 2>will make you filthy rich.</v>

87
00:04:58.080 --> 00:04:59.040
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe not,</v>

88
00:04:59.041 --> 00:05:00.720
<v Speaker 2>but hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can dream right,</v>

89
00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:04.560
<v Speaker 2>and this last person is also not a </v>
<v Speaker 2>Hollywood star,</v>

90
00:05:04.561 --> 00:05:07.710
<v Speaker 2>but this person is huge and it is mark </v>
<v Speaker 2>Zuckerberg.</v>

91
00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:08.753
<v Speaker 2>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we all know mark Zuckerberg is the </v>

92
00:05:10.051 --> 00:05:10.884
<v Speaker 2>founder of facebook and he made big </v>
<v Speaker 2>headlines last year by speaking at a </v>

93
00:05:13.861 --> 00:05:14.694
<v Speaker 2>conference in China in Mandarin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He actually did an interview with an </v>

94
00:05:17.671 --> 00:05:19.860
<v Speaker 2>interviewer in Mandarin for about 30 </v>
<v Speaker 2>minutes.</v>

95
00:05:19.861 --> 00:05:20.694
<v Speaker 2>Let's take a look.</v>

96
00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:30.610
<v Speaker 7>You're jumping in.</v>
<v Speaker 7>She jumped.</v>

97
00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:34.540
<v Speaker 7>She kind of,</v>

98
00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:37.533
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it doesn't seem like mark is </v>

99
00:05:38.981 --> 00:05:42.430
<v Speaker 2>completely fluent in Mandarin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he seems to have the basics down.</v>

100
00:05:42.431 --> 00:05:44.110
<v Speaker 2>He's got a working knowledge of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>language.</v>

101
00:05:44.111 --> 00:05:48.340
<v Speaker 2>He seems to be able to answer questions </v>
<v Speaker 2>and express himself so it is what it is.</v>

102
00:05:48.341 --> 00:05:49.960
<v Speaker 2>He'll continue to improve.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure.</v>

103
00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:53.410
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how he studied or studies </v>
<v Speaker 2>the language,</v>

104
00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:54.483
<v Speaker 2>but his reasons for studying the </v>
<v Speaker 2>language are interesting and those are </v>

105
00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:57.943
<v Speaker 2>lessons in and of themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His first reason for studying the </v>

106
00:06:00.141 --> 00:06:04.220
<v Speaker 2>language is that his wife is of Chinese </v>
<v Speaker 2>descent and he wants to communicate with</v>

107
00:06:04.221 --> 00:06:05.054
<v Speaker 2>her family,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that shows us that having a specific </v>

108
00:06:07.731 --> 00:06:11.000
<v Speaker 2>group of people that you really want to </v>
<v Speaker 2>communicate with in that language,</v>

109
00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:14.570
<v Speaker 2>that's a great motivator to push you to </v>
<v Speaker 2>learn the language.</v>

110
00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:15.613
<v Speaker 2>His second reason for learning the </v>
<v Speaker 2>language is that China is a great </v>

111
00:06:18.351 --> 00:06:21.200
<v Speaker 2>country,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a great culture and a great civilization</v>

112
00:06:21.201 --> 00:06:22.700
<v Speaker 2>and he wants to learn more about it.</v>

113
00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:23.893
<v Speaker 2>I think what he says that that's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>veiled way of saying that he wants to </v>

114
00:06:26.541 --> 00:06:29.930
<v Speaker 2>get facebook into China because it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>such an important place,</v>

115
00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:32.240
<v Speaker 2>but if we take what he says at face </v>
<v Speaker 2>value,</v>

116
00:06:32.241 --> 00:06:33.074
<v Speaker 2>then of course wanting to know more </v>
<v Speaker 2>about an important culture is a great </v>

117
00:06:35.961 --> 00:06:39.560
<v Speaker 2>motivation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if his main point is to get facebook</v>

118
00:06:39.561 --> 00:06:42.110
<v Speaker 2>into China than that too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that kind of goal,</v>

119
00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:44.270
<v Speaker 2>having an important business goal like </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

120
00:06:44.450 --> 00:06:45.283
<v Speaker 2>that is also a powerful external </v>
<v Speaker 2>motivator to get you studying a </v>

121
00:06:48.171 --> 00:06:49.004
<v Speaker 2>language.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His third reason for studying mandarin </v>

122
00:06:50.541 --> 00:06:51.374
<v Speaker 2>is that he enjoys challenges and he </v>
<v Speaker 2>thinks mandarin is a challenging </v>

123
00:06:54.081 --> 00:06:54.891
<v Speaker 2>language.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

124
00:06:54.891 --> 00:06:58.910
<v Speaker 2>think about that attitude for a second.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's really an attitude of success.</v>

125
00:06:59.090 --> 00:06:59.923
<v Speaker 2>If you think that challenge is bad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you think that anything difficult or </v>

126
00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:05.300
<v Speaker 2>anything that makes you uncomfortable as</v>
<v Speaker 2>bad,</v>

127
00:07:05.450 --> 00:07:06.283
<v Speaker 2>then you're going to shy away from </v>
<v Speaker 2>learning a language because it's </v>

128
00:07:08.271 --> 00:07:12.230
<v Speaker 2>sometimes necessary to break out of your</v>
<v Speaker 2>comfort zone to learn a language.</v>

129
00:07:12.410 --> 00:07:13.243
<v Speaker 2>But if you embrace that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you see that as getting yourself </v>

130
00:07:15.081 --> 00:07:16.360
<v Speaker 2>fired up for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

131
00:07:16.490 --> 00:07:17.323
<v Speaker 2>as making yourself more powerful by </v>
<v Speaker 2>fighting through some kind of challenge </v>

132
00:07:20.591 --> 00:07:21.424
<v Speaker 2>of difficulty than that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's just an attitude that can propel </v>

133
00:07:23.901 --> 00:07:27.380
<v Speaker 2>you forward rather than making you shy </v>
<v Speaker 2>away from learning a language.</v>

134
00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:30.350
<v Speaker 2>None of these people are known mainly </v>
<v Speaker 2>for their language skills,</v>

135
00:07:30.351 --> 00:07:31.184
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're all known mainly for some other </v>

136
00:07:32.691 --> 00:07:36.860
<v Speaker 2>talent or skill or creation that they've</v>
<v Speaker 2>contributed to the world and they're all</v>

137
00:07:36.861 --> 00:07:39.020
<v Speaker 2>really quite busy focusing on those </v>
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>

138
00:07:39.170 --> 00:07:42.530
<v Speaker 2>But the fact that they can become good </v>
<v Speaker 2>at a foreign language,</v>

139
00:07:42.531 --> 00:07:43.364
<v Speaker 2>even though they're focused on this </v>
<v Speaker 2>other central goal that shows you that </v>

140
00:07:45.681 --> 00:07:47.990
<v Speaker 2>you can do it too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So take them as examples.</v>

141
00:07:47.991 --> 00:07:51.890
<v Speaker 2>People we can learn from people we can </v>
<v Speaker 2>be inspired by and motivated by.</v>

142
00:07:52.010 --> 00:07:56.270
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people like to watch famous </v>
<v Speaker 2>people and observe their lives,</v>

143
00:07:56.271 --> 00:07:58.370
<v Speaker 2>but don't just watch them as observers.</v>

144
00:07:58.370 --> 00:08:02.300
<v Speaker 2>I want you to actually learn something </v>
<v Speaker 2>from them and emulate the good qualities</v>

145
00:08:02.301 --> 00:08:04.970
<v Speaker 2>of those people are right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is Paul from length focus.</v>

146
00:08:04.971 --> 00:08:07.310
<v Speaker 2>I hope you enjoyed this video.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have a nice night.</v>

147
00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:08.153
<v Speaker 2>Talk to you later in French has been the</v>
<v Speaker 2>easiest language that I have personally </v>

148
00:08:13.101 --> 00:08:13.934
<v Speaker 2>studied.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I used to think it was Indonesian </v>

149
00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:18.520
<v Speaker 2>because Indonesia is really simple.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In the future.</v>

150
00:08:18.521 --> 00:08:19.354
<v Speaker 2>Beyond that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can see the next goal in front of </v>

151
00:08:21.161 --> 00:08:21.994
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is to start learning Spanish or </v>

152
00:08:23.141 --> 00:08:25.450
<v Speaker 2>whatever your language of interest </v>
<v Speaker 2>gives,</v>

153
00:08:25.690 --> 00:08:26.523
<v Speaker 2>but just think of it like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you're not discarding those goals </v>

154
00:08:29.381 --> 00:08:30.214
<v Speaker 2>are discarding those missions you are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You were kind of putting them off into </v>

155
00:08:33.251 --> 00:08:34.084
<v Speaker 2>the future and you'll get to them later.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But your primary mission right now is </v>

156
00:08:37.241 --> 00:08:39.550
<v Speaker 2>this one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What you need to accomplish first before</v>

157
00:08:39.551 --> 00:08:41.110
<v Speaker 2>you can get to that future mission.</v>
