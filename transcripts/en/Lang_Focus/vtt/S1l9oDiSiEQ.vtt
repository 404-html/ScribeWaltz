00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:01.313
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>

2
00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.823
<v Speaker 1>Hello everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Welcome to the Lange Focus Channel and </v>

3
00:00:17.451 --> 00:00:18.950
<v Speaker 1>my name is Paul.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

4
00:00:18.951 --> 00:00:19.784
<v Speaker 1>that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Today the focus channel has reached </v>

5
00:00:21.471 --> 00:00:23.000
<v Speaker 1>50,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>subscribers.</v>

6
00:00:23.001 --> 00:00:25.580
<v Speaker 1>This is a big day for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I started my channel,</v>

7
00:00:25.581 --> 00:00:28.880
<v Speaker 1>I always had the dream in mind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the goal in mind of reaching 50,000</v>

8
00:00:28.881 --> 00:00:29.714
<v Speaker 1>subscribers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I thought that was kind of the </v>

9
00:00:30.921 --> 00:00:31.754
<v Speaker 1>pinnacle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now it seems like that's an achievable </v>

10
00:00:33.351 --> 00:00:36.560
<v Speaker 1>goal and we'll see how much further I </v>
<v Speaker 1>can get them $50,000,</v>

11
00:00:36.561 --> 00:00:39.830
<v Speaker 1>but for now I've achieved my initial </v>
<v Speaker 1>goal and that's really great.</v>

12
00:00:39.831 --> 00:00:42.800
<v Speaker 1>Really exciting for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So thank you for all of your support.</v>

13
00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:44.053
<v Speaker 1>So onto today's topic imagined that </v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a mysterious language in </v>

14
00:00:49.251 --> 00:00:50.084
<v Speaker 1>Europe that was surrounded on all sides </v>
<v Speaker 1>by languages that it had absolutely no </v>

15
00:00:53.631 --> 00:00:56.810
<v Speaker 1>connection with wealth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Directionally is a language like that.</v>

16
00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:59.120
<v Speaker 1>The language is the Basque language.</v>

17
00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:02.213
<v Speaker 1>Basque is a language isolate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning that it has no known connection </v>

18
00:01:05.071 --> 00:01:07.560
<v Speaker 1>to any other language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's located in Europe,</v>

19
00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.520
<v Speaker 1>but it's not an Indo European language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It forms its own language.</v>

20
00:01:11.521 --> 00:01:12.354
<v Speaker 1>Family ended is quite distinct,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very different from Indo European </v>

21
00:01:14.851 --> 00:01:17.520
<v Speaker 1>languages.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is spoken by the basket people in the</v>

22
00:01:17.521 --> 00:01:20.010
<v Speaker 1>Basque country or region that spans the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Spain,</v>

23
00:01:20.011 --> 00:01:22.680
<v Speaker 1>France border in the Western most </v>
<v Speaker 1>Pyrenees mountains.</v>

24
00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.883
<v Speaker 1>It is not spoken by all Basques,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but by around 27 percent of them in the </v>

25
00:01:27.961 --> 00:01:29.160
<v Speaker 1>basket country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Overall,</v>

26
00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.310
<v Speaker 1>the number of native speakers is </v>
<v Speaker 1>714,000,</v>

27
00:01:32.311 --> 00:01:35.580
<v Speaker 1>135 out of a total population of 2 </v>
<v Speaker 1>million,</v>

28
00:01:35.581 --> 00:01:40.581
<v Speaker 1>648,998,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that includes about 663,000</v>

29
00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:44.100
<v Speaker 1>on the Spanish side and 51,100</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the French side.</v>

30
00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:47.010
<v Speaker 1>It is an official language at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>regional level in Spain,</v>

31
00:01:47.011 --> 00:01:49.840
<v Speaker 1>in the basket,</v>
<v Speaker 1>autonomous community and in I've already</v>

32
00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.160
<v Speaker 1>in France,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it holds no official status.</v>

33
00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.820
<v Speaker 1>The origins of the Basque language are </v>
<v Speaker 1>shrouded in mystery.</v>

34
00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.160
<v Speaker 1>As I said before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is a language isolate.</v>

35
00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:00.173
<v Speaker 1>It is thought to be the last remaining </v>
<v Speaker 1>language that existed in Europe before </v>

36
00:02:03.121 --> 00:02:05.310
<v Speaker 1>the arrival of the Indo European </v>
<v Speaker 1>languages.</v>

37
00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:09.933
<v Speaker 1>There is conclusive evidence that basket</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a descendant of the aqua tanium </v>

38
00:02:12.791 --> 00:02:13.624
<v Speaker 1>language,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is an ancient language spoken in </v>

39
00:02:14.921 --> 00:02:15.754
<v Speaker 1>the Pyrenees region.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some similarities are known between </v>

40
00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:20.020
<v Speaker 1>Aquitania and the ancient Iberian </v>
<v Speaker 1>language,</v>

41
00:02:20.021 --> 00:02:22.300
<v Speaker 1>so some people think that they might be </v>
<v Speaker 1>related,</v>

42
00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:23.253
<v Speaker 1>but those similarities might just be due</v>
<v Speaker 1>to geographic proximity and mutual </v>

43
00:02:26.261 --> 00:02:28.060
<v Speaker 1>influence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't know.</v>

44
00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:28.923
<v Speaker 1>Some linguists suggests that Aqua Tinian</v>
<v Speaker 1>was part of a wider language family </v>

45
00:02:31.811 --> 00:02:32.644
<v Speaker 1>called the vest chronic languages which </v>
<v Speaker 1>covered most of Europe before the </v>

46
00:02:35.201 --> 00:02:37.900
<v Speaker 1>arrival of the Indo European languages,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but again,</v>

47
00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:40.900
<v Speaker 1>we don't know other people draw </v>
<v Speaker 1>connection between baskin,</v>

48
00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:44.200
<v Speaker 1>other non into European languages like </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Caucasian languages,</v>

49
00:02:44.201 --> 00:02:45.034
<v Speaker 1>but again,</v>

50
00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:47.970
<v Speaker 1>that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't know.</v>

51
00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:48.953
<v Speaker 1>One thing we do know is that the Basque </v>
<v Speaker 1>people who descend mostly from farmers </v>

52
00:02:52.141 --> 00:02:56.520
<v Speaker 1>who arrived in the area around 6,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>years ago were isolated from the outside</v>

53
00:02:56.521 --> 00:02:57.354
<v Speaker 1>world for thousands of years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's probably partly of the best </v>

54
00:02:59.921 --> 00:03:00.754
<v Speaker 1>countries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>forested mountain terrain and it's lack </v>

55
00:03:02.801 --> 00:03:05.320
<v Speaker 1>of tempting resources that prevented </v>
<v Speaker 1>invasion.</v>

56
00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:06.363
<v Speaker 1>This isolation is probably what allowed </v>
<v Speaker 1>their language to survive and develop </v>

57
00:03:09.521 --> 00:03:11.770
<v Speaker 1>into the Basque language of today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

58
00:03:11.771 --> 00:03:12.604
<v Speaker 1>there were Latin borrowings into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>language and there have been other </v>

59
00:03:14.561 --> 00:03:16.930
<v Speaker 1>romance language borrowings throughout </v>
<v Speaker 1>the centuries,</v>

60
00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:17.943
<v Speaker 1>but nothing like the total disappearance</v>
<v Speaker 1>of other pre Latin languages in that </v>

61
00:03:20.831 --> 00:03:21.664
<v Speaker 1>area.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Basketball's a unified language until </v>

62
00:03:23.141 --> 00:03:23.974
<v Speaker 1>the Middle Ages,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when it began to diverge into dialects </v>

63
00:03:26.021 --> 00:03:29.620
<v Speaker 1>because of administrative and political </v>
<v Speaker 1>divisions within the Basque country,</v>

64
00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:33.040
<v Speaker 1>despite being ruled by outside regimes </v>
<v Speaker 1>throughout the centuries,</v>

65
00:03:33.041 --> 00:03:33.874
<v Speaker 1>the best country still remained isolated</v>
<v Speaker 1>and relatively uninfluenced by the </v>

66
00:03:37.421 --> 00:03:39.520
<v Speaker 1>outside world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that includes the language.</v>

67
00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:43.480
<v Speaker 1>But when Francisco Franco became ruler </v>
<v Speaker 1>of Spain in 1939,</v>

68
00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:44.583
<v Speaker 1>the use of Basque was heavily suppressed</v>
<v Speaker 1>because Franco wanted to assimilate all </v>

69
00:03:47.771 --> 00:03:52.000
<v Speaker 1>of Spain into castilian culture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was forbidden to speak baskin schools</v>

70
00:03:52.001 --> 00:03:52.834
<v Speaker 1>and to public.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was banned from media and removed </v>

71
00:03:54.641 --> 00:03:55.474
<v Speaker 1>from public services.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This led to a big reduction in the </v>

72
00:03:57.401 --> 00:03:59.590
<v Speaker 1>number of people who could speak the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Basque language,</v>

73
00:03:59.591 --> 00:04:00.424
<v Speaker 1>and that's part of the reason that only </v>
<v Speaker 1>27 percent of people in the Basque </v>

74
00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:04.780
<v Speaker 1>country speak the language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Today.</v>

75
00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:05.793
<v Speaker 1>In the 19 sixties that suppression was </v>
<v Speaker 1>eased somewhat and Basque language </v>

76
00:04:08.591 --> 00:04:09.424
<v Speaker 1>schools became permitted and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>language begin being used in </v>

77
00:04:11.681 --> 00:04:13.720
<v Speaker 1>publications and in education.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>

78
00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:17.400
<v Speaker 1>this led to the creation of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>standardized language called [inaudible]</v>

79
00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:18.303
<v Speaker 1>about [inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was developed by the Basque Language </v>

80
00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:23.990
<v Speaker 1>Academy or the Scouts and the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it was intended to be comprehensible</v>

81
00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:26.260
<v Speaker 1>to speakers of the various dialects of </v>
<v Speaker 1>basket.</v>

82
00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:30.590
<v Speaker 1>There are five main basket dialects be </v>
<v Speaker 1>Skyann or western basket,</v>

83
00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:32.530
<v Speaker 1>keep Fusco on or central Basque.</v>

84
00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:34.280
<v Speaker 1>Upper Novari's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Novari's,</v>

85
00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:36.520
<v Speaker 1>Freudian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the town in France.</v>

86
00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:38.223
<v Speaker 1>These dialects correspond with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>historic provinces of the Basque </v>

87
00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:41.313
<v Speaker 1>country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they don't completely correspond </v>

88
00:04:42.431 --> 00:04:43.264
<v Speaker 1>with the modern provinces of today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The level of intelligibility depends on </v>

89
00:04:46.571 --> 00:04:47.404
<v Speaker 1>the distance between those two dialects </v>
<v Speaker 1>on the dialect continuum with the most </v>

90
00:04:50.291 --> 00:04:52.900
<v Speaker 1>distant dialects,</v>
<v Speaker 1>having trouble understanding each other,</v>

91
00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:55.720
<v Speaker 1>but that's where the standard language </v>
<v Speaker 1>use got about two or comes in.</v>

92
00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:58.060
<v Speaker 1>So what is the Basque language like?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

93
00:04:58.120 --> 00:04:58.953
<v Speaker 1>it's vocabulary has been influenced by </v>
<v Speaker 1>the surrounding romance languages to </v>

94
00:05:01.571 --> 00:05:03.490
<v Speaker 1>some extent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when you look at it structure,</v>

95
00:05:03.491 --> 00:05:04.324
<v Speaker 1>you will see that it is unlike any </v>
<v Speaker 1>romance language or like any Indo </v>

96
00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:08.980
<v Speaker 1>European language for that matter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bass,</v>

97
00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:11.800
<v Speaker 1>Kaz grammatical cases,</v>
<v Speaker 1>12 cases to be exact,</v>

98
00:05:11.801 --> 00:05:14.740
<v Speaker 1>but that is not really unusual in Indo </v>
<v Speaker 1>European languages,</v>

99
00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:17.260
<v Speaker 1>but it has something called the </v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] case.</v>

100
00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:18.183
<v Speaker 1>That means that there's a special form </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the noun when it's the subject of a </v>

101
00:05:20.471 --> 00:05:22.750
<v Speaker 1>sentence and it takes a transitive verb.</v>

102
00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:26.950
<v Speaker 1>That means it has a direct object.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This ergotism case is marked with a k at</v>

103
00:05:26.951 --> 00:05:28.060
<v Speaker 1>the end of the known.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

104
00:05:28.061 --> 00:05:28.894
<v Speaker 1>along with the [inaudible] case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is also something called the </v>

105
00:05:30.641 --> 00:05:31.474
<v Speaker 1>absolute of case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is for subjects of intransitive </v>

106
00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:35.980
<v Speaker 1>verbs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning that it has no direct object,</v>

107
00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:38.230
<v Speaker 1>and in this case there was no ending on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the end of the.</v>

108
00:05:38.231 --> 00:05:38.891
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

109
00:05:38.891 --> 00:05:40.750
<v Speaker 1>let's take a look at a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 1>sentences.</v>

110
00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:41.950
<v Speaker 1>Who America?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Leanne,</v>

111
00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:47.020
<v Speaker 1>that means the child fell in the street.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if we look at it word by word,</v>

112
00:05:47.021 --> 00:05:49.960
<v Speaker 1>you can see the interesting structure of</v>
<v Speaker 1>Basque word by word.</v>

113
00:05:49.961 --> 00:05:50.794
<v Speaker 1>It's child the street.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The in fall is if we look at the first </v>

114
00:05:55.331 --> 00:05:57.070
<v Speaker 1>word there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who may his child,</v>

115
00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:59.930
<v Speaker 1>but then the definite article is the a </v>
<v Speaker 1>at the end.</v>

116
00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:00.943
<v Speaker 1>Then for the next word,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kellyanne Conway is street and then the </v>

117
00:06:03.171 --> 00:06:06.260
<v Speaker 1>definite article is up and then in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>end,</v>

118
00:06:06.261 --> 00:06:08.360
<v Speaker 1>at the end of the word,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we look at the next word,</v>

119
00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:09.500
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a verb,</v>

120
00:06:09.501 --> 00:06:11.840
<v Speaker 1>meaning fall,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's in the perfect aspect.</v>

121
00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:15.800
<v Speaker 1>That means that it shows a completed </v>
<v Speaker 1>action and then the auxiliary verb comes</v>

122
00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:19.820
<v Speaker 1>after the main verb at the end and this </v>
<v Speaker 1>one means is it's the present tense form</v>

123
00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:21.890
<v Speaker 1>of to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And another sentence,</v>

124
00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:26.930
<v Speaker 1>Maddie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that means the man has given the book to</v>

125
00:06:26.931 --> 00:06:29.480
<v Speaker 1>the child,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so word by word man,</v>

126
00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:34.430
<v Speaker 1>the [inaudible] case child,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the data of case book,</v>

127
00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:37.590
<v Speaker 1>the given has.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first word is Gisele knuck.</v>

128
00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:38.763
<v Speaker 1>The zone is man than the definite </v>
<v Speaker 1>article is a and then the negative case </v>

129
00:06:42.290 --> 00:06:45.080
<v Speaker 1>is k Lumiata.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's child again,</v>

130
00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:45.943
<v Speaker 1>child is meant and then this time it has</v>
<v Speaker 1>the definite article a and then it has </v>

131
00:06:49.491 --> 00:06:51.860
<v Speaker 1>the date of case marker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The at the end,</v>

132
00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:55.610
<v Speaker 1>the date of case basically shows who or </v>
<v Speaker 1>what is being affected by the action,</v>

133
00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:56.540
<v Speaker 1>the next word,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Buddha,</v>

134
00:06:57.050 --> 00:06:59.630
<v Speaker 1>the Buddha to his book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then as the definite article,</v>

135
00:06:59.690 --> 00:07:02.450
<v Speaker 1>and this one looks like a lone word from</v>
<v Speaker 1>a romance language.</v>

136
00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:03.313
<v Speaker 1>The next one a month is a verb and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the perfect aspect showing that the </v>

137
00:07:06.111 --> 00:07:10.250
<v Speaker 1>action is completed and then the </v>
<v Speaker 1>auxiliary verb deal comes after and that</v>

138
00:07:10.251 --> 00:07:14.630
<v Speaker 1>means has and the next sentence in my </v>
<v Speaker 1>view,</v>

139
00:07:15.170 --> 00:07:16.003
<v Speaker 1>that means the woman has seen the memo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so word by word woman the or gets IV </v>

140
00:07:19.821 --> 00:07:20.654
<v Speaker 1>case man is a scene has.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the first word in Morocco may act in </v>

141
00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:29.170
<v Speaker 1>macrame is woman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is the A and ergonomic cases.</v>

142
00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:31.250
<v Speaker 1>TheK ,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the next word [inaudible].</v>

143
00:07:31.370 --> 00:07:33.560
<v Speaker 1>That's the man and the definite article.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>

144
00:07:33.770 --> 00:07:35.990
<v Speaker 1>the next word is [inaudible],</v>
<v Speaker 1>which means scene and again,</v>

145
00:07:35.991 --> 00:07:36.824
<v Speaker 1>that's a verb with the perfect aspect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>showing the actions completed and then </v>

146
00:07:39.561 --> 00:07:42.620
<v Speaker 1>the auxiliary verb comes at the end and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it means has,</v>

147
00:07:43.490 --> 00:07:44.323
<v Speaker 1>as you can see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Basque language is very different </v>

148
00:07:45.891 --> 00:07:46.724
<v Speaker 1>from any Indo European language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very different from any language that </v>

149
00:07:48.951 --> 00:07:49.784
<v Speaker 1>I've studied,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it also looks quite logical and </v>

150
00:07:51.771 --> 00:07:52.604
<v Speaker 1>systematic.</v>

151
00:07:52.610 --> 00:07:53.443
<v Speaker 1>It would be a shame to lose a language </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's so unique and that connects us </v>

152
00:07:55.971 --> 00:07:56.804
<v Speaker 1>with the ancient history of Europe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The number of Basque speakers has </v>

153
00:07:59.631 --> 00:08:03.830
<v Speaker 1>sharply declined over the last century,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there are efforts in Spain to revive</v>

154
00:08:03.831 --> 00:08:04.664
<v Speaker 1>the language and to make it more </v>
<v Speaker 1>widespread again and hopefully such </v>

155
00:08:07.220 --> 00:08:10.790
<v Speaker 1>efforts will continue and become more </v>
<v Speaker 1>prominent in France as well.</v>
