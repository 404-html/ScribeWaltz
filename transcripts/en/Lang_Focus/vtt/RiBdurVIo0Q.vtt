00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:02.640
<v Speaker 1>Hello everyone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>welcome to the lange focus channel.</v>

2
00:00:02.641 --> 00:00:03.620
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my name is Paul.</v>

3
00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:08.130
<v Speaker 1>Today's video is the second installment </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the series mystery languages.</v>

4
00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:10.860
<v Speaker 1>If you haven't seen the first video in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the mystery language,</v>

5
00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:13.410
<v Speaker 1>a series,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can check it out right here,</v>

6
00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:14.633
<v Speaker 1>but basically this is how it works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I will play you an audio sample of a </v>

7
00:00:17.311 --> 00:00:21.150
<v Speaker 1>language and then I'll show you a visual</v>
<v Speaker 1>samples of the language and it's written</v>

8
00:00:21.151 --> 00:00:23.880
<v Speaker 1>for them and you can guess what language</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is,</v>

9
00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:25.740
<v Speaker 1>but whether you guessed correctly or </v>
<v Speaker 1>not,</v>

10
00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:26.603
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The important thing is that you leave </v>

11
00:00:28.081 --> 00:00:28.914
<v Speaker 1>your guesses and the reasons for your </v>
<v Speaker 1>guesses in the comments down below and </v>

12
00:00:31.411 --> 00:00:33.300
<v Speaker 1>that will spark some interesting </v>
<v Speaker 1>discussion.</v>

13
00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.610
<v Speaker 1>So let's get right into the first </v>
<v Speaker 1>language.</v>

14
00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:36.593
<v Speaker 1>Please listen,</v>

15
00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:37.433
<v Speaker 2>I'm bidding in a pile in the middle one </v>
<v Speaker 2>upon which enabled me to pronounce away </v>

16
00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:47.003
<v Speaker 2>Nomia Sheila.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a building and some peanut volcker </v>

17
00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.290
<v Speaker 2>to Monica,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the upper market but Lukla bond.</v>

18
00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:53.600
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lions are going to.</v>

19
00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:58.880
<v Speaker 1>Now let's have a look at a few written </v>
<v Speaker 1>samples of that same language.</v>

20
00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:02.990
<v Speaker 3>Nema,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nina Harland.</v>

21
00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.120
<v Speaker 3>Cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But don't they?</v>

22
00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.240
<v Speaker 1>So what language do you think it is?</v>

23
00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:17.380
<v Speaker 1>The language is a language spoken on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>island of Cebu in the Philippines.</v>

24
00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:19.720
<v Speaker 1>If you guessed together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>log or Filipino,</v>

25
00:01:19.721 --> 00:01:22.360
<v Speaker 1>which is the official language which is </v>
<v Speaker 1>based on Tagalog,</v>

26
00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:26.200
<v Speaker 1>then that's a pretty good guests because</v>
<v Speaker 1>to Gallaghan Silvano are closely related</v>

27
00:01:26.201 --> 00:01:28.060
<v Speaker 1>languages I've studied together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>

28
00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:31.420
<v Speaker 1>I'm fairly familiar with it and when I </v>
<v Speaker 1>look at Sidwell I know sometimes I don't</v>

29
00:01:31.421 --> 00:01:34.030
<v Speaker 1>know if I'm looking at Tagalog with lots</v>
<v Speaker 1>of vocabulary,</v>

30
00:01:34.031 --> 00:01:34.864
<v Speaker 1>I don't know or whether I'm looking at </v>
<v Speaker 1>say Bono said we wanna was sometimes </v>

31
00:01:37.451 --> 00:01:38.284
<v Speaker 1>referred to as Bisiah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is actually a group of closely </v>

32
00:01:40.661 --> 00:01:44.170
<v Speaker 1>related languages that are spoken in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Visayas region in the Philippines,</v>

33
00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:45.123
<v Speaker 1>but some people like to refer to all the</v>
<v Speaker 1>languages as a single language with </v>

34
00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:49.803
<v Speaker 1>different dialects and that's because </v>
<v Speaker 1>all the Bisiah languages are quite </v>

35
00:01:52.241 --> 00:01:54.160
<v Speaker 1>closely related.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But also because.</v>

36
00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:55.013
<v Speaker 1>Well there's power in numbers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You may have noticed the Spanish </v>

37
00:01:57.551 --> 00:01:58.384
<v Speaker 1>vocabulary in the sample sentences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's because it has lots of Spanish </v>

38
00:02:01.541 --> 00:02:02.374
<v Speaker 1>long words just like to Gallo does in </v>
<v Speaker 1>fact several one or has even more </v>

39
00:02:04.841 --> 00:02:06.660
<v Speaker 1>Spanish words meant together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

40
00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:09.250
<v Speaker 1>Onto the second language,</v>
<v Speaker 1>please listen.</v>

41
00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:16.940
<v Speaker 4>They get food when he's sad,</v>
<v Speaker 4>her warm up so they can meet,</v>

42
00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:21.270
<v Speaker 4>meet and whole manual,</v>
<v Speaker 4>mundane,</v>

43
00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:24.040
<v Speaker 4>poem.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They put handcuffs,</v>

44
00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:28.580
<v Speaker 4>put him to hold still</v>

45
00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:31.193
<v Speaker 1>and again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's have a look at some written </v>

46
00:02:32.101 --> 00:02:32.934
<v Speaker 1>samples.</v>

47
00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:39.160
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I guess</v>

48
00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.170
<v Speaker 1>so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What language is it?</v>

49
00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.943
<v Speaker 1>It's the loud language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lao is a language spoken in the </v>

50
00:02:48.961 --> 00:02:49.794
<v Speaker 1>Southeast Asian nation of Laos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a member of the Tai Chi language </v>

51
00:02:53.311 --> 00:02:54.144
<v Speaker 1>family,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is spoken in some parts of </v>

52
00:02:54.901 --> 00:02:57.540
<v Speaker 1>Southeast Asia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>southern China and northern India.</v>

53
00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:58.643
<v Speaker 1>If you thought the language was tied </v>
<v Speaker 1>then you were very close because ty and </v>

54
00:03:01.571 --> 00:03:02.404
<v Speaker 1>Lao,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or very closely related to a large </v>

55
00:03:03.851 --> 00:03:05.560
<v Speaker 1>degree,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they are mutually intelligible.</v>

56
00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:06.513
<v Speaker 1>They are both tonal languages,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but one notable differences that ty has </v>

57
00:03:09.191 --> 00:03:11.470
<v Speaker 1>five tones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While Lau has six tones,</v>

58
00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:13.870
<v Speaker 1>they're also written in a slightly </v>
<v Speaker 1>different script,</v>

59
00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:14.793
<v Speaker 1>but the scripts themselves are also </v>
<v Speaker 1>closely related and if you can read one </v>

60
00:03:17.161 --> 00:03:18.730
<v Speaker 1>than reading the others shouldn't be too</v>
<v Speaker 1>hard.</v>

61
00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:19.803
<v Speaker 1>Some of you may have noticed the tones </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the language samples which make the </v>

62
00:03:22.121 --> 00:03:22.954
<v Speaker 1>language sound kind of melodic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you might have guessed one of the </v>

63
00:03:24.881 --> 00:03:27.100
<v Speaker 1>Chinese languages like Mandarin or </v>
<v Speaker 1>Cantonese,</v>

64
00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:30.040
<v Speaker 1>and those guesses would make sense </v>
<v Speaker 1>because those are tonal languages.</v>

65
00:03:30.041 --> 00:03:31.870
<v Speaker 1>Just like lawand tire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

66
00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:34.360
<v Speaker 1>Onto the third language,</v>
<v Speaker 1>please listen.</v>

67
00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:38.593
<v Speaker 6>Modify on central park.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Young Scheme will mix as a club Dj Vika </v>

68
00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:54.670
<v Speaker 6>Outta the shop does issue three,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Dan</v>

69
00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:58.383
<v Speaker 1>and again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's see a bit of the language </v>

70
00:03:59.381 --> 00:04:00.214
<v Speaker 1>visually.</v>

71
00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:04.490
<v Speaker 7>Schools that Cmo,</v>
<v Speaker 7>oh,</v>

72
00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:09.720
<v Speaker 7>seemed more Zune genito Dr.</v>
<v Speaker 7>departure,</v>

73
00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:15.260
<v Speaker 1>so what language is it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the Romanian language.</v>

74
00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:16.123
<v Speaker 1>If you speak any romance languages that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you've probably noticed right away that </v>

75
00:04:18.651 --> 00:04:21.470
<v Speaker 1>there was a lot of romance vocabulary in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the samples,</v>

76
00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:24.440
<v Speaker 1>what the pronunciation might have seemed</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of unusual to you.</v>

77
00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:28.490
<v Speaker 1>That's because Romanian is a romance </v>
<v Speaker 1>language with some Slavic influence.</v>

78
00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:32.450
<v Speaker 1>That influence affects the pronunciation</v>
<v Speaker 1>and also the vocabulary of the language.</v>

79
00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:33.493
<v Speaker 1>You may have also noticed the little </v>
<v Speaker 1>glyphs above the letter a and below the </v>

80
00:04:35.871 --> 00:04:39.740
<v Speaker 1>letter t those glyphs or actually an </v>
<v Speaker 1>integral part of those letters and those</v>

81
00:04:39.741 --> 00:04:41.300
<v Speaker 1>letters along with this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

82
00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:42.163
<v Speaker 1>and this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Give you a quick hint that you're </v>

83
00:04:43.131 --> 00:04:46.010
<v Speaker 1>looking at Romanian and not at a </v>
<v Speaker 1>different romance language.</v>

84
00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:47.053
<v Speaker 1>Romanian is spoken in Romania and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Moldova and is geographically isolated </v>

85
00:04:50.451 --> 00:04:51.284
<v Speaker 1>from the other major romance languages.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Slavic influence on the language </v>

86
00:04:54.021 --> 00:04:56.300
<v Speaker 1>makes it distinct from the other romance</v>
<v Speaker 1>languages,</v>

87
00:04:56.390 --> 00:05:00.560
<v Speaker 1>but Romanian is also said to be the </v>
<v Speaker 1>closest romance language to the original</v>

88
00:05:00.561 --> 00:05:01.850
<v Speaker 1>Latin in grammar.</v>

89
00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:04.580
<v Speaker 1>That's probably true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in some other areas like phonology,</v>

90
00:05:04.581 --> 00:05:07.820
<v Speaker 1>it may not be as close to the original </v>
<v Speaker 1>Latin as say Italian.</v>

91
00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:08.863
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hope you enjoyed guessing today's </v>

92
00:05:09.771 --> 00:05:10.604
<v Speaker 1>mystery languages.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Leave your guesses and your reasons in </v>

93
00:05:12.291 --> 00:05:13.124
<v Speaker 1>the comments down below and also letting</v>
<v Speaker 1>me know if you like the series and you </v>

94
00:05:15.531 --> 00:05:17.660
<v Speaker 1>think I should continue doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And again,</v>

95
00:05:17.661 --> 00:05:18.494
<v Speaker 1>I want to say thank you to all of my </v>
<v Speaker 1>patrion supporters for your continued </v>

96
00:05:20.871 --> 00:05:21.704
<v Speaker 1>support,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially these ones right here on the </v>

97
00:05:22.941 --> 00:05:25.460
<v Speaker 1>screen for there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially generous pledges.</v>

98
00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:27.310
<v Speaker 1>Thank you for watching and have a nice.</v>
