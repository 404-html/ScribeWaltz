00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:02.850
<v Speaker 1>Hello everyone and welcome to the lange </v>
<v Speaker 1>focus channel.</v>

2
00:00:02.851 --> 00:00:03.684
<v Speaker 1>Today I'm going to talk about a question</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I've been getting quite a lot </v>

3
00:00:06.301 --> 00:00:11.010
<v Speaker 1>recently and that is what kind of job </v>
<v Speaker 1>can I do with my foreign language skills</v>

4
00:00:11.011 --> 00:00:14.910
<v Speaker 1>or what kind of job should I do if I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>interested in foreign languages?</v>

5
00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:16.043
<v Speaker 1>Now this is a question that I respect </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I've witnessed a lot of people </v>

6
00:00:18.841 --> 00:00:19.674
<v Speaker 1>investing years of their life into </v>
<v Speaker 1>studying a language kind of with the </v>

7
00:00:22.201 --> 00:00:23.034
<v Speaker 1>assumption that it would naturally </v>
<v Speaker 1>improve their career or give them new </v>

8
00:00:25.801 --> 00:00:26.634
<v Speaker 1>opportunities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but without having a plan for how they </v>

9
00:00:28.651 --> 00:00:29.484
<v Speaker 1>would use that language,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they didn't really benefit from it and </v>

10
00:00:31.471 --> 00:00:32.304
<v Speaker 1>ended up being quite frustrated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So young people who are asking this </v>

11
00:00:34.651 --> 00:00:35.484
<v Speaker 1>question early on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you are thinking about things </v>

12
00:00:37.411 --> 00:00:38.244
<v Speaker 1>the right way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the answer to this question depends </v>

13
00:00:39.931 --> 00:00:43.890
<v Speaker 1>on just how you imagine your life in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>future and how far you really want to go</v>

14
00:00:43.891 --> 00:00:45.180
<v Speaker 1>with your language study.</v>

15
00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:46.253
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some jobs are specifically language </v>

16
00:00:47.461 --> 00:00:50.460
<v Speaker 1>related.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Other jobs are not specifically language</v>

17
00:00:50.461 --> 00:00:52.980
<v Speaker 1>related,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a foreign language could be an asset</v>

18
00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.470
<v Speaker 1>and for other jobs it's not really </v>
<v Speaker 1>necessary at all,</v>

19
00:00:55.471 --> 00:00:58.150
<v Speaker 1>but it might be useful for your overall </v>
<v Speaker 1>lifestyle.</v>

20
00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.810
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to talk about those three </v>
<v Speaker 1>types of situations.</v>

21
00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.990
<v Speaker 1>So first up are jobs that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>specifically language related.</v>

22
00:01:03.991 --> 00:01:04.824
<v Speaker 1>For these jobs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you need to have some expertise in the </v>

23
00:01:06.271 --> 00:01:08.640
<v Speaker 1>language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You need to have a deep understanding of</v>

24
00:01:08.641 --> 00:01:09.474
<v Speaker 1>the language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the first kind of job is to teach a </v>

25
00:01:11.311 --> 00:01:12.450
<v Speaker 1>language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here in Japan,</v>

26
00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:14.520
<v Speaker 1>I know a lot of people who teach </v>
<v Speaker 1>English.</v>

27
00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.210
<v Speaker 1>I also know people who teach other </v>
<v Speaker 1>languages like French or Spanish.</v>

28
00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:19.223
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if you don't have a lot of </v>

29
00:01:20.011 --> 00:01:20.844
<v Speaker 1>qualifications,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are some opportunities to teach </v>

30
00:01:22.771 --> 00:01:23.604
<v Speaker 1>your language,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if it's a major global </v>

31
00:01:25.201 --> 00:01:26.034
<v Speaker 1>language and especially if it's English,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the more qualifications that you </v>

32
00:01:28.621 --> 00:01:29.454
<v Speaker 1>have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then of course the better opportunities </v>

33
00:01:30.811 --> 00:01:34.200
<v Speaker 1>you get and the higher pay you can get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the better positions you can find.</v>

34
00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.980
<v Speaker 1>Now if you want to study a foreign </v>
<v Speaker 1>language that's not your native language</v>

35
00:01:37.981 --> 00:01:41.250
<v Speaker 1>and then teach that language,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you're looking at a situation where</v>

36
00:01:41.251 --> 00:01:45.000
<v Speaker 1>you really need to get some expertise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You really need to get qualifications.</v>

37
00:01:45.001 --> 00:01:45.834
<v Speaker 1>You should get like a masters degree or </v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe a phd or qualifications that show </v>

38
00:01:49.531 --> 00:01:52.680
<v Speaker 1>that you know that language very well at</v>
<v Speaker 1>an academic level,</v>

39
00:01:52.681 --> 00:01:55.110
<v Speaker 1>at a deep level of not just a </v>
<v Speaker 1>conversational level.</v>

40
00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:55.973
<v Speaker 1>That's if you're going to teach a </v>
<v Speaker 1>language that's not your native </v>

41
00:01:57.961 --> 00:02:00.480
<v Speaker 1>language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now another type of job that is language</v>

42
00:02:00.481 --> 00:02:03.480
<v Speaker 1>specific is becoming a translator or an </v>
<v Speaker 1>interpreter.</v>

43
00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.230
<v Speaker 1>Now the difference between those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just to clarify a translator is somebody</v>

44
00:02:07.231 --> 00:02:08.064
<v Speaker 1>who translates texts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They translate written materials from </v>

45
00:02:10.441 --> 00:02:11.274
<v Speaker 1>one language to another,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but an interpreter as somebody who </v>

46
00:02:13.141 --> 00:02:13.974
<v Speaker 1>translates speech that translate the </v>
<v Speaker 1>things people are saying live in real </v>

47
00:02:17.161 --> 00:02:18.420
<v Speaker 1>time as they are speaking.</v>

48
00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:19.523
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>being a translator or an interpreter </v>

49
00:02:20.821 --> 00:02:21.654
<v Speaker 1>requires you to have a very deep </v>
<v Speaker 1>understanding of that language because </v>

50
00:02:24.391 --> 00:02:27.420
<v Speaker 1>there's really no room for error or </v>
<v Speaker 1>misunderstanding.</v>

51
00:02:27.421 --> 00:02:31.080
<v Speaker 1>You have to translate sometimes very </v>
<v Speaker 1>important information and mistakes could</v>

52
00:02:31.081 --> 00:02:31.914
<v Speaker 1>be a big problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you need to have very good almost </v>

53
00:02:34.351 --> 00:02:37.290
<v Speaker 1>native level skills,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially for if you're interpreting in</v>

54
00:02:37.291 --> 00:02:39.990
<v Speaker 1>real time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But also you need to learn the skills of</v>

55
00:02:39.991 --> 00:02:40.824
<v Speaker 1>translation or interpreting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are separate skills that you need </v>

56
00:02:43.291 --> 00:02:44.124
<v Speaker 1>to learn on top of knowing the language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for these jobs that are specifically </v>

57
00:02:47.071 --> 00:02:47.904
<v Speaker 1>language related,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's really no room for language </v>

58
00:02:49.771 --> 00:02:50.604
<v Speaker 1>dabblers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You really need to have a comprehensive </v>

59
00:02:52.141 --> 00:02:55.680
<v Speaker 1>understanding of that language and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>have to be able to show that you can use</v>

60
00:02:55.681 --> 00:02:56.514
<v Speaker 1>that language at almost a native level.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Next up are jobs that are not </v>

61
00:02:59.651 --> 00:03:00.484
<v Speaker 1>specifically language related.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They are basically focused on another </v>

62
00:03:03.071 --> 00:03:04.180
<v Speaker 1>skill that you need.</v>

63
00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:05.193
<v Speaker 1>But the language is an additional asset.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first kind of job is one that </v>

64
00:03:08.141 --> 00:03:12.010
<v Speaker 1>requires some technical expertise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but having a language on top of that,</v>

65
00:03:12.011 --> 00:03:16.180
<v Speaker 1>we'll give you some extra opportunities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So an example that I've heard is from an</v>

66
00:03:16.181 --> 00:03:17.014
<v Speaker 1>engineer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His company sells some sort of machines </v>

67
00:03:19.241 --> 00:03:23.320
<v Speaker 1>to companies around the world and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>send this engineer to those companies so</v>

68
00:03:23.321 --> 00:03:24.154
<v Speaker 1>he can teach people how to use those </v>
<v Speaker 1>machines in their factory so he learns </v>

69
00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.920
<v Speaker 1>foreign languages so that he can do </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

70
00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:33.310
<v Speaker 1>I believe this guy in particular was </v>
<v Speaker 1>working in Indonesia,</v>

71
00:03:33.311 --> 00:03:34.144
<v Speaker 1>so he learned Indonesian to be able to </v>
<v Speaker 1>teach those people in their native </v>

72
00:03:36.701 --> 00:03:38.230
<v Speaker 1>language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Another example,</v>

73
00:03:38.231 --> 00:03:40.750
<v Speaker 1>career,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his business with a regional focus.</v>

74
00:03:40.751 --> 00:03:41.584
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe you get a commerce degree or you </v>

75
00:03:43.751 --> 00:03:45.940
<v Speaker 1>get a master's of business </v>
<v Speaker 1>administration,</v>

76
00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:46.803
<v Speaker 1>an Mba,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also you have some language skills </v>

77
00:03:49.001 --> 00:03:49.834
<v Speaker 1>and maybe you work for a company that </v>
<v Speaker 1>does business in that region or does </v>

78
00:03:52.361 --> 00:03:54.430
<v Speaker 1>business with companies in that region.</v>

79
00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:56.860
<v Speaker 1>Another example career is the foreign </v>
<v Speaker 1>service.</v>

80
00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:57.723
<v Speaker 1>Being a diplomat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>being someone who works at your </v>

81
00:03:59.201 --> 00:04:02.320
<v Speaker 1>country's embassies abroad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you work in the foreign service,</v>

82
00:04:02.321 --> 00:04:03.154
<v Speaker 1>I think that often involves some kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>language training before you are sent </v>

83
00:04:05.861 --> 00:04:06.694
<v Speaker 1>abroad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but knowing some languages in advanced </v>

84
00:04:08.441 --> 00:04:10.990
<v Speaker 1>before you apply is probably a big </v>
<v Speaker 1>asset.</v>

85
00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:14.230
<v Speaker 1>Another example is being a tour guide.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now a tour guides.</v>

86
00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:15.093
<v Speaker 1>Main focus is not the language,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the history and it's the </v>

87
00:04:17.321 --> 00:04:19.570
<v Speaker 1>anthropology and all of those sorts of </v>
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>

88
00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:20.523
<v Speaker 1>but having a language that they can </v>
<v Speaker 1>explain things in that will help them </v>

89
00:04:23.441 --> 00:04:24.274
<v Speaker 1>have other opportunities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So maybe you might specialize in </v>

90
00:04:26.471 --> 00:04:28.600
<v Speaker 1>tourists from Japan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you learn Japanese,</v>

91
00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:32.620
<v Speaker 1>you can be a tour guide for Japanese </v>
<v Speaker 1>tourists depending on where you live.</v>

92
00:04:32.621 --> 00:04:33.454
<v Speaker 1>Another option might be to do some other</v>
<v Speaker 1>job in the tourism industry or open a </v>

93
00:04:36.851 --> 00:04:38.530
<v Speaker 1>business in the tourism industry.</v>

94
00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:41.020
<v Speaker 1>If you live on Bailey island in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Indonesia,</v>

95
00:04:41.021 --> 00:04:41.854
<v Speaker 1>then you would be crazy not to learn </v>
<v Speaker 1>English and Japanese and maybe some </v>

96
00:04:44.501 --> 00:04:46.900
<v Speaker 1>other languages that are common amongst </v>
<v Speaker 1>tourists.</v>

97
00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:49.030
<v Speaker 1>Another career as being a cabin </v>
<v Speaker 1>attended.</v>

98
00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:49.923
<v Speaker 1>Now their main focus is on safety </v>
<v Speaker 1>training on a emergency response and </v>

99
00:04:53.021 --> 00:04:53.854
<v Speaker 1>that kind of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But knowing a language that's an </v>

100
00:04:55.361 --> 00:04:56.194
<v Speaker 1>additional asset,</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably they need to know English in </v>

101
00:04:58.540 --> 00:04:59.373
<v Speaker 1>most cases,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they also need to know the language </v>

102
00:05:01.031 --> 00:05:05.020
<v Speaker 1>of the country they're working in or of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the destination that they often fly too.</v>

103
00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:06.790
<v Speaker 1>Maybe they don't need to know it </v>
<v Speaker 1>fluently,</v>

104
00:05:06.791 --> 00:05:07.624
<v Speaker 1>but knowing some of that language will </v>
<v Speaker 1>help them deal with the passengers on </v>

105
00:05:10.151 --> 00:05:10.984
<v Speaker 1>the plan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you live in Los Angeles and you </v>

106
00:05:12.341 --> 00:05:13.174
<v Speaker 1>often fly to Asia than knowing Japanese </v>
<v Speaker 1>or Korean or mandarin or another </v>

107
00:05:16.781 --> 00:05:19.210
<v Speaker 1>language like that would probably be a </v>
<v Speaker 1>big asset.</v>

108
00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:21.310
<v Speaker 1>Now all of these jobs I just talked </v>
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>

109
00:05:21.311 --> 00:05:23.760
<v Speaker 1>they're focused on another important </v>
<v Speaker 1>skill,</v>

110
00:05:23.761 --> 00:05:25.390
<v Speaker 1>so they're not focused on language.</v>

111
00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:28.810
<v Speaker 1>So you don't need a specific language </v>
<v Speaker 1>qualification in most cases,</v>

112
00:05:28.811 --> 00:05:29.644
<v Speaker 1>but you need to be able to demonstrate </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you can use that language on the </v>

113
00:05:32.411 --> 00:05:33.910
<v Speaker 1>job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the most important thing.</v>

114
00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:34.953
<v Speaker 1>The third type of job I want to mention </v>
<v Speaker 1>is one that doesn't really have any </v>

115
00:05:37.301 --> 00:05:38.134
<v Speaker 1>language requirement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but learning that language would be </v>

116
00:05:40.031 --> 00:05:43.180
<v Speaker 1>useful for your off time and for your </v>
<v Speaker 1>overall lifestyle.</v>

117
00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:44.103
<v Speaker 1>So let's say that you live in Singapore </v>
<v Speaker 1>and your company does business in </v>

118
00:05:46.691 --> 00:05:47.524
<v Speaker 1>English,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you don't have to learn any other </v>

119
00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:51.040
<v Speaker 1>language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People in Singapore speak English,</v>

120
00:05:51.041 --> 00:05:55.420
<v Speaker 1>but nearby as Malaysia and Indonesia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's say you want to travel there on</v>

121
00:05:55.421 --> 00:05:56.254
<v Speaker 1>your off time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Learning molay or learning Indonesian </v>

122
00:05:58.011 --> 00:05:58.844
<v Speaker 1>would be very useful in that situation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So think about the kind of lifestyle </v>

123
00:06:02.001 --> 00:06:04.940
<v Speaker 1>that you want to have and think about </v>
<v Speaker 1>how language is fit in with that.</v>

124
00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:08.570
<v Speaker 1>Let's say that you want to live the </v>
<v Speaker 1>corporate expat lifestyle and some place</v>

125
00:06:08.571 --> 00:06:09.404
<v Speaker 1>like Hong Kong.</v>

126
00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:10.333
<v Speaker 1>Then you can study Cantonese while you </v>
<v Speaker 1>get your finance degree or you get your </v>

127
00:06:13.371 --> 00:06:14.204
<v Speaker 1>mba or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you want to be a programmer and you </v>

128
00:06:16.371 --> 00:06:18.680
<v Speaker 1>can program from your laptop anywhere in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world,</v>

129
00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:19.543
<v Speaker 1>then think about what country you would </v>
<v Speaker 1>like to live in and learn the language </v>

130
00:06:21.831 --> 00:06:22.664
<v Speaker 1>of that country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're an avid traveler and you love </v>

131
00:06:24.561 --> 00:06:27.110
<v Speaker 1>the idea of living in different </v>
<v Speaker 1>countries all the time,</v>

132
00:06:27.111 --> 00:06:27.944
<v Speaker 1>then you can learn how to do businesses </v>
<v Speaker 1>on the Internet and you can learn the </v>

133
00:06:31.011 --> 00:06:34.720
<v Speaker 1>language of whatever countries that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>want to spend an extended period of time</v>

134
00:06:34.721 --> 00:06:35.554
<v Speaker 1>then or if you want to learn a foreign </v>
<v Speaker 1>language and you want to someday reach </v>

135
00:06:38.151 --> 00:06:40.610
<v Speaker 1>to an expert level and be able to teach </v>
<v Speaker 1>that language,</v>

136
00:06:40.611 --> 00:06:43.410
<v Speaker 1>then plan ahead for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe go for your master's degree,</v>

137
00:06:43.411 --> 00:06:44.244
<v Speaker 1>your phd tried to really get a deep </v>
<v Speaker 1>understanding and overall knowledge of </v>

138
00:06:47.751 --> 00:06:48.584
<v Speaker 1>that language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So these are just my thoughts on that </v>

139
00:06:50.241 --> 00:06:52.400
<v Speaker 1>based on things that I know and things </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I've heard.</v>

140
00:06:52.401 --> 00:06:55.020
<v Speaker 1>But a lot of the viewers have different </v>
<v Speaker 1>perspectives.</v>

141
00:06:55.021 --> 00:06:57.920
<v Speaker 1>Some of you probably have jobs that </v>
<v Speaker 1>involve foreign languages,</v>

142
00:06:57.921 --> 00:06:58.754
<v Speaker 1>so we want to know what you think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you have any other ideas or any </v>

143
00:07:01.131 --> 00:07:03.650
<v Speaker 1>questions about this topic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>leave them down below.</v>

144
00:07:03.890 --> 00:07:05.750
<v Speaker 1>Thank you for watching and have a nice.</v>
