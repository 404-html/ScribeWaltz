<v Speaker 1>Hello everyone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>welcome to the Lange Focus Channel and </v>

2
00:00:03.091 --> 00:00:03.924
<v Speaker 1>my name is Paul.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Today's topic is the Korean language or </v>

3
00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:11.940
<v Speaker 1>hungle name as it's called in Korean and</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually in North Korea.</v>

4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:12.833
<v Speaker 1>It's called Tucson.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My Korean is one of the major languages </v>

5
00:00:16.351 --> 00:00:17.184
<v Speaker 1>of Northeast Asia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's spoken as a first language by a </v>

6
00:00:19.621 --> 00:00:20.454
<v Speaker 1>total of around 80 million people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>including around $50 million in South </v>

7
00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:24.713
<v Speaker 1>Korea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>$25 million in North Korea and around </v>

8
00:00:26.551 --> 00:00:27.384
<v Speaker 1>two point 5 million in China,</v>
<v Speaker 1>including the Yom [inaudible] and Chung </v>

9
00:00:30.061 --> 00:00:30.894
<v Speaker 1>back Korean autonomous areas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which are both in Gelian province near </v>

10
00:00:34.141 --> 00:00:38.160
<v Speaker 1>the border with North Korea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's also spoken by minorities in Japan,</v>

11
00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:39.023
<v Speaker 1>Russia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and numerous other countries throughout </v>

12
00:00:40.441 --> 00:00:41.274
<v Speaker 1>the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The roots of the Korean language are </v>

13
00:00:42.871 --> 00:00:45.450
<v Speaker 1>unclear and are the subject of much </v>
<v Speaker 1>debate.</v>

14
00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:46.393
<v Speaker 1>Some think it's a member of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>altruistic language family alongside </v>

15
00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.320
<v Speaker 1>Turkic Mongolian and 10 gooseneck and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Japonica languages,</v>

16
00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:53.243
<v Speaker 1>but these days the alltech language </v>
<v Speaker 1>family is no longer widely accepted or </v>

17
00:00:56.641 --> 00:00:58.290
<v Speaker 1>shall we say it's unproven.</v>

18
00:00:58.470 --> 00:00:59.303
<v Speaker 1>Others think that Korean shares ancient </v>
<v Speaker 1>roots with the dravidian languages of </v>

19
00:01:02.431 --> 00:01:03.264
<v Speaker 1>southern India and Sri Lanka,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's another theory that Korean </v>

20
00:01:05.791 --> 00:01:08.040
<v Speaker 1>derives from the Austronesian language </v>
<v Speaker 1>family,</v>

21
00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.040
<v Speaker 1>but there's no definitive proof for any </v>
<v Speaker 1>of these theories,</v>

22
00:01:11.041 --> 00:01:14.220
<v Speaker 1>so Korean is often defined as a language</v>
<v Speaker 1>isolate.</v>

23
00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.980
<v Speaker 1>The sole member of the chorionic </v>
<v Speaker 1>language family.</v>

24
00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:18.053
<v Speaker 1>The lack of evidence for any of these </v>
<v Speaker 1>theories is largely because of the lack </v>

25
00:01:21.121 --> 00:01:21.954
<v Speaker 1>of samples of older Korean writing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The oldest samples that we are aware of </v>

26
00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.370
<v Speaker 1>are less than a thousand years old and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the written in Chinese characters making</v>

27
00:01:29.371 --> 00:01:34.371
<v Speaker 1>them hard to decipher old Korean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first century ce marks the beginning</v>

28
00:01:34.411 --> 00:01:35.244
<v Speaker 1>of the three kingdoms period on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Korean Peninsula and Manchuria the </v>

29
00:01:38.371 --> 00:01:41.470
<v Speaker 1>kingdoms were picked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>J and Sheila.</v>

30
00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:42.683
<v Speaker 1>It's not known for sure just how closely</v>
<v Speaker 1>the languages of these kingdoms were </v>

31
00:01:45.631 --> 00:01:46.464
<v Speaker 1>related.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They may have all been closely related </v>

32
00:01:48.571 --> 00:01:49.404
<v Speaker 1>dialects of old Korean or they may have </v>
<v Speaker 1>been distinct members of the chorionic </v>

33
00:01:53.011 --> 00:01:55.260
<v Speaker 1>language family from limited </v>
<v Speaker 1>information,</v>

34
00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:56.430
<v Speaker 1>mainly place names.</v>

35
00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.850
<v Speaker 1>It appears that the languages were </v>
<v Speaker 1>similar but not exactly the same.</v>

36
00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:01.283
<v Speaker 1>There may have been two groups have </v>
<v Speaker 1>chorionic languages with a group </v>

37
00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:05.093
<v Speaker 1>including Pouliot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Co gooyow and pull your Pec Jay and the </v>

38
00:02:08.521 --> 00:02:11.370
<v Speaker 1>hunting group,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which included Shinola in South Korea.</v>

39
00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:12.233
<v Speaker 1>It's widely believed that Shinola is the</v>
<v Speaker 1>direct ancestor of modern Korean in </v>

40
00:02:15.991 --> 00:02:16.824
<v Speaker 1>North Korea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's widely believed that go google is </v>

41
00:02:18.901 --> 00:02:23.901
<v Speaker 1>the direct ancestor of modern Korean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>During the Unified Sheila period,</v>

42
00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:24.773
<v Speaker 1>beginning in the seventh century,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when Sheila conquered the other </v>

43
00:02:27.061 --> 00:02:27.894
<v Speaker 1>kingdoms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Shilla variety became the dominant </v>

44
00:02:29.701 --> 00:02:30.534
<v Speaker 1>language of the peninsula.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the form of old Korean that </v>

45
00:02:33.001 --> 00:02:33.834
<v Speaker 1>became the ancestor of Middle Korean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Korea has been tremendously influenced </v>

46
00:02:38.401 --> 00:02:41.610
<v Speaker 1>by China throughout its history due to </v>
<v Speaker 1>invasion attempts,</v>

47
00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:43.650
<v Speaker 1>alliances,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and extensive trade.</v>

48
00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:45.623
<v Speaker 1>The influence on Korean culture includes</v>
<v Speaker 1>stunning influence on the Korean </v>

49
00:02:48.541 --> 00:02:51.120
<v Speaker 1>language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Since Korean didn't have its own writing</v>

50
00:02:51.121 --> 00:02:51.954
<v Speaker 1>system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it adopted the Chinese writing system </v>

51
00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:54.533
<v Speaker 1>and used it well into the era of Middle </v>
<v Speaker 1>Korean and a huge amount of Chinese </v>

52
00:02:57.991 --> 00:03:00.970
<v Speaker 1>vocabulary entered Korean through the </v>
<v Speaker 1>literary language,</v>

53
00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:02.763
<v Speaker 1>Middle Korean.</v>

54
00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:06.010
<v Speaker 1>When the Korea Dynasty began in the 10th</v>
<v Speaker 1>century,</v>

55
00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:06.963
<v Speaker 1>the capital moved to case on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the case on dialect became the </v>

56
00:03:09.641 --> 00:03:12.970
<v Speaker 1>prestige language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems that by this time the peninsula</v>

57
00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.810
<v Speaker 1>basically spoke the same language,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so this was simply a dialectal change.</v>

58
00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:21.010
<v Speaker 1>The first written record of Korean that </v>
<v Speaker 1>we know of beyond place names comes from</v>

59
00:03:21.011 --> 00:03:21.844
<v Speaker 1>this time period,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sources Chinese and gives a few </v>

60
00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:28.450
<v Speaker 1>hundred examples of Korean words written</v>
<v Speaker 1>phonetically using Chinese characters.</v>

61
00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:29.403
<v Speaker 1>One feature of Middle Korean is that it </v>
<v Speaker 1>featured for tones and on top of that </v>

62
00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:35.920
<v Speaker 1>Chinese loan words still retained their </v>
<v Speaker 1>tones as well.</v>

63
00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:39.520
<v Speaker 1>These tone distinctions have disappeared</v>
<v Speaker 1>in modern standard Korean,</v>

64
00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:43.300
<v Speaker 1>but there are a couple of dialects that </v>
<v Speaker 1>do retain some of these distinctions.</v>

65
00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:44.343
<v Speaker 1>We know that Middle Korean had tones </v>
<v Speaker 1>because there were markings indicating </v>

66
00:03:47.291 --> 00:03:48.124
<v Speaker 1>tone in the hungle writing system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was created in 1444 by king say </v>

67
00:03:52.421 --> 00:03:53.254
<v Speaker 1>Joan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the great of the Chosun Dynasty humble </v>

68
00:03:55.691 --> 00:03:56.524
<v Speaker 1>was created to increase literacy among </v>
<v Speaker 1>the poor and people without a formal </v>

69
00:03:59.621 --> 00:04:00.454
<v Speaker 1>education.</v>

70
00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:01.803
<v Speaker 1>Prior to the creation of hungle Korean </v>
<v Speaker 1>went through a number of different </v>

71
00:04:04.511 --> 00:04:05.344
<v Speaker 1>writing systems that use Chinese </v>
<v Speaker 1>characters in various ways to represent </v>

72
00:04:08.351 --> 00:04:09.184
<v Speaker 1>Korean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>None of which were an ideal match for </v>

73
00:04:10.781 --> 00:04:13.540
<v Speaker 1>Korean or very easy to learn in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>beginning.</v>

74
00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:16.450
<v Speaker 1>Elites and scholars opposed the </v>
<v Speaker 1>introduction of hungle,</v>

75
00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:17.313
<v Speaker 1>but over the following centuries it </v>
<v Speaker 1>became widespread and humble is such an </v>

76
00:04:20.471 --> 00:04:21.304
<v Speaker 1>ingenious writing system that it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>really hard to imagine how it wouldn't </v>

77
00:04:23.831 --> 00:04:24.664
<v Speaker 1>have become widespread for a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Korean was often written and published </v>

78
00:04:28.031 --> 00:04:32.140
<v Speaker 1>in a mixed script using hunch on Chinese</v>
<v Speaker 1>characters for content,</v>

79
00:04:32.141 --> 00:04:36.040
<v Speaker 1>words and hungle for functional or </v>
<v Speaker 1>grammatical words and inflections.</v>

80
00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:39.100
<v Speaker 1>It was quite similar to how Japanese is </v>
<v Speaker 1>still written today.</v>

81
00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:40.203
<v Speaker 1>Speaking of Japanese,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Korea was occupied by Japan from 1910 </v>

82
00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:46.660
<v Speaker 1>until 1945.</v>
<v Speaker 1>During the occupation,</v>

83
00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:47.523
<v Speaker 1>Japanese was made.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The official language and policies were </v>

84
00:04:49.631 --> 00:04:50.464
<v Speaker 1>implemented that would have replaced </v>
<v Speaker 1>Korean with Japanese if the occupation </v>

85
00:04:54.101 --> 00:04:55.000
<v Speaker 1>had not been ended.</v>

86
00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:55.953
<v Speaker 1>Japanese was made the language of </v>
<v Speaker 1>education except for Korean class and </v>

87
00:04:59.291 --> 00:05:00.124
<v Speaker 1>speaking Korean at school was band.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Koreans were pressured to replace their </v>

88
00:05:03.431 --> 00:05:06.460
<v Speaker 1>Korean names with Japanese names and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Korean language.</v>

89
00:05:06.461 --> 00:05:07.294
<v Speaker 1>Newspapers were ordered to shut down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These assimilationist policies were </v>

90
00:05:10.451 --> 00:05:14.290
<v Speaker 1>gradually introduced and speed it up in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the later years of the occupation.</v>

91
00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:15.843
<v Speaker 1>Thankfully,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Korean language survived to the </v>

92
00:05:17.201 --> 00:05:18.034
<v Speaker 1>occupation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a significant amount of Japanese </v>

93
00:05:19.871 --> 00:05:23.100
<v Speaker 1>vocabulary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was absorbed into the language in the</v>

94
00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:23.933
<v Speaker 1>decades since the occupation ended.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hungyo have gradually become </v>

95
00:05:26.591 --> 00:05:29.410
<v Speaker 1>deemphasized in favor of hungle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nowadays,</v>

96
00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:33.220
<v Speaker 1>most texts are written entirely or </v>
<v Speaker 1>mostly in hungle with hunch up,</v>

97
00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:34.083
<v Speaker 1>mainly used to prevent possible </v>
<v Speaker 1>ambiguity between homophones and in </v>

98
00:05:37.271 --> 00:05:38.104
<v Speaker 1>North Korea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Specifically hunch shot were eliminated </v>

99
00:05:40.091 --> 00:05:40.924
<v Speaker 1>from all official publications in 1949.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to speculate that the growing </v>

100
00:05:44.771 --> 00:05:48.820
<v Speaker 1>emphasis on hungle was partly a reaction</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the Japanese occupation,</v>

101
00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:49.743
<v Speaker 1>that a growing sense of Korean </v>
<v Speaker 1>sovereignty made the Korean people want </v>

102
00:05:52.301 --> 00:05:54.700
<v Speaker 1>to use more of their nations homegrown </v>
<v Speaker 1>script.</v>

103
00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:59.000
<v Speaker 1>The existence of the hungle script is </v>
<v Speaker 1>now every year on hungle day,</v>

104
00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:02.540
<v Speaker 1>October ninth in South Korea and on </v>
<v Speaker 1>chosen Google Day,</v>

105
00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:07.040
<v Speaker 1>January 15th in North Korea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Both Koreas have a literacy rate of over</v>

106
00:06:07.041 --> 00:06:10.040
<v Speaker 1>99 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I guess there is reason to celebrate.</v>

107
00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:12.350
<v Speaker 1>So what's Korean like?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

108
00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:13.213
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot to say about Korean and </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no way I can give a complete </v>

109
00:06:15.861 --> 00:06:19.250
<v Speaker 1>comprehensive overview of the whole </v>
<v Speaker 1>language in a single video,</v>

110
00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:21.500
<v Speaker 1>but we'll look at some of it's important</v>
<v Speaker 1>features.</v>

111
00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:22.603
<v Speaker 1>Hungle hungle is a fantastic writing </v>
<v Speaker 1>system that you can learn to read very </v>

112
00:06:26.331 --> 00:06:27.164
<v Speaker 1>quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is a basic set of consonant and </v>

113
00:06:29.001 --> 00:06:32.900
<v Speaker 1>vowel symbols that are arranged together</v>
<v Speaker 1>to form compact syllables.</v>

114
00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:35.810
<v Speaker 1>This says hungle this symbolist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>

115
00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:37.730
<v Speaker 1>This is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is,</v>

116
00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:39.980
<v Speaker 1>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is,</v>

117
00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:41.510
<v Speaker 1>and this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

118
00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:42.883
<v Speaker 1>this system is ingenious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because once you get used to the most </v>

119
00:06:45.411 --> 00:06:49.190
<v Speaker 1>common combinations of symbols,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you can instantly recognize them.</v>

120
00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:52.640
<v Speaker 1>The consonant symbols fall into groups </v>
<v Speaker 1>of different letters.</v>

121
00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:53.533
<v Speaker 1>These continents are vilar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the basic shape shows the tongues </v>

122
00:06:56.271 --> 00:06:57.104
<v Speaker 1>position in the mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This point indicates the place of </v>

123
00:06:59.091 --> 00:06:59.924
<v Speaker 1>articulation near the back of the mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These consonants are alveolar and the </v>

124
00:07:03.471 --> 00:07:06.380
<v Speaker 1>basic shape shows the tongue touching </v>
<v Speaker 1>the roof of the mouth.</v>

125
00:07:06.650 --> 00:07:11.240
<v Speaker 1>These consonants are bilabial and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>basic shape shows a mouth with two lips.</v>

126
00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:12.223
<v Speaker 1>These consonants are dentals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the basic shape shows the place of </v>

127
00:07:14.991 --> 00:07:18.500
<v Speaker 1>articulation at the upper teeth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These consonants are glottal,</v>

128
00:07:18.710 --> 00:07:22.400
<v Speaker 1>and the basic shape shows that the place</v>
<v Speaker 1>of articulation is in your throat.</v>

129
00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:24.133
<v Speaker 1>Vocabulary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In most current examples of written </v>

130
00:07:26.121 --> 00:07:26.954
<v Speaker 1>Korean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all or almost all of the words are </v>

131
00:07:28.371 --> 00:07:30.980
<v Speaker 1>written in Hungle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>including native Korean words.</v>

132
00:07:30.981 --> 00:07:31.711
<v Speaker 1>And Sign,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

133
00:07:31.711 --> 00:07:33.890
<v Speaker 1>Korean words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>words of Chinese origin,</v>

134
00:07:34.070 --> 00:07:35.240
<v Speaker 1>believe it or not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sign.</v>

135
00:07:35.241 --> 00:07:37.910
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Korean words account for over 60 percent</v>

136
00:07:37.911 --> 00:07:39.290
<v Speaker 1>of Korean vocabulary.</v>

137
00:07:39.410 --> 00:07:42.500
<v Speaker 1>There are most prevalent in formal and </v>
<v Speaker 1>academic vocabulary,</v>

138
00:07:42.530 --> 00:07:44.870
<v Speaker 1>but they're very common in everyday </v>
<v Speaker 1>speech as well.</v>

139
00:07:45.470 --> 00:07:49.130
<v Speaker 1>Let's look at the Chinese vocabulary </v>
<v Speaker 1>that appears in the following sentences.</v>

140
00:07:49.340 --> 00:07:51.500
<v Speaker 1>This sentence means,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you like your teacher?</v>

141
00:07:51.610 --> 00:07:55.050
<v Speaker 1>Some of the same names were.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He'll notice the word sunsetting,</v>

142
00:07:55.130 --> 00:07:57.920
<v Speaker 1>which means teacher.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This word is of Chinese origin.</v>

143
00:07:58.730 --> 00:08:00.830
<v Speaker 1>This sentence means what's your phone </v>
<v Speaker 1>number?</v>

144
00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:01.873
<v Speaker 1>So novel and allowable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All the words for telephone and number </v>

145
00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:09.320
<v Speaker 1>are of Chinese origin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When Korean is written in a mixed hungle</v>

146
00:08:09.321 --> 00:08:10.160
<v Speaker 1>hunt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just script.</v>

147
00:08:10.220 --> 00:08:13.100
<v Speaker 1>You can more easily identify it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Sino Korean words,</v>

148
00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:13.993
<v Speaker 1>and you can more easily distinguish </v>
<v Speaker 1>between words that sound the same </v>

149
00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:18.890
<v Speaker 1>because they are written with different </v>
<v Speaker 1>Chinese characters,</v>

150
00:08:18.980 --> 00:08:20.930
<v Speaker 1>but these days they are mainly written </v>
<v Speaker 1>in hungle.</v>

151
00:08:21.140 --> 00:08:24.440
<v Speaker 1>Korean also contains more recent loan </v>
<v Speaker 1>words from other languages,</v>

152
00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:28.070
<v Speaker 1>mainly English words like choose soup,</v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning juice,</v>

153
00:08:28.460 --> 00:08:30.990
<v Speaker 1>poor meaning fork,</v>
<v Speaker 1>send,</v>

154
00:08:30.991 --> 00:08:31.370
<v Speaker 1>do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eat,</v>

155
00:08:31.370 --> 00:08:32.990
<v Speaker 1>see meaning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sandwich.</v>

156
00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:34.033
<v Speaker 1>Obviously the pronunciation of these </v>
<v Speaker 1>words has naturally changed and become </v>

157
00:08:36.861 --> 00:08:37.694
<v Speaker 1>suited to Korean phonology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some loan words are abbreviated or used </v>

158
00:08:41.331 --> 00:08:43.730
<v Speaker 1>in ways that the original words were not</v>
<v Speaker 1>used.</v>

159
00:08:43.820 --> 00:08:47.150
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the word said con means Selfie,</v>

160
00:08:47.210 --> 00:08:49.520
<v Speaker 1>which came from the words self and </v>
<v Speaker 1>camera.</v>

161
00:08:50.060 --> 00:08:54.890
<v Speaker 1>Another example I usually ping means </v>
<v Speaker 1>window shopping and comes from the words</v>

162
00:08:54.900 --> 00:08:59.130
<v Speaker 1>I and shopping sentence structure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Korean is a verb,</v>

163
00:08:59.131 --> 00:09:02.070
<v Speaker 1>final language with the verb.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At the end of the sentence,</v>

164
00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:06.750
<v Speaker 1>a typical sentence is Sov.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This sentence means I play baseball.</v>

165
00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:09.570
<v Speaker 1>None in Yagoona Hale.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's the subject.</v>

166
00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:11.580
<v Speaker 1>Now here's the object.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

167
00:09:11.581 --> 00:09:13.260
<v Speaker 1>Gu,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and here's the verb.</v>

168
00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:14.273
<v Speaker 1>Hail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's also possible to say the sentence </v>

169
00:09:16.471 --> 00:09:19.080
<v Speaker 1>with no subject if it's clear from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>context,</v>

170
00:09:19.230 --> 00:09:21.450
<v Speaker 1>but let's go back to the original </v>
<v Speaker 1>sentence for a minute.</v>

171
00:09:21.810 --> 00:09:24.150
<v Speaker 1>In addition to the subject,</v>
<v Speaker 1>object and verb,</v>

172
00:09:24.270 --> 00:09:25.920
<v Speaker 1>there are two other words in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>sentence.</v>

173
00:09:26.010 --> 00:09:27.330
<v Speaker 1>These words are particles.</v>

174
00:09:27.450 --> 00:09:28.283
<v Speaker 1>Words that are placed after nouns to </v>
<v Speaker 1>indicate their function or relationship </v>

175
00:09:31.441 --> 00:09:35.700
<v Speaker 1>to other words in the sentence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Little is a direct object marker showing</v>

176
00:09:35.701 --> 00:09:36.121
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

177
00:09:36.121 --> 00:09:40.770
<v Speaker 1>Gu baseball is the object of the verb.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A little is the form that follows a word</v>

178
00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:42.330
<v Speaker 1>ending in a vowel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

179
00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:45.060
<v Speaker 1>is the form that follows words ending in</v>
<v Speaker 1>a consonant,</v>

180
00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:50.250
<v Speaker 1>noon is a topic marker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The form that comes afterwards ending in</v>

181
00:09:50.251 --> 00:09:53.910
<v Speaker 1>a consonant is earned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not is the subject of the sentence,</v>

182
00:09:53.940 --> 00:09:54.773
<v Speaker 1>but it's also the topic that means now </v>
<v Speaker 1>is information that has previously been </v>

183
00:09:58.501 --> 00:10:03.030
<v Speaker 1>mentioned or as clear from the context </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that it's the topic being elaborated</v>

184
00:10:03.031 --> 00:10:05.760
<v Speaker 1>on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are also subject markers.</v>

185
00:10:06.030 --> 00:10:10.140
<v Speaker 1>He after a consonant and Qa after a </v>
<v Speaker 1>vowel subject,</v>

186
00:10:10.141 --> 00:10:10.974
<v Speaker 1>markers are used to introduce new </v>
<v Speaker 1>information or to introduce the </v>

187
00:10:13.681 --> 00:10:16.440
<v Speaker 1>importance of existing information.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>

188
00:10:16.441 --> 00:10:17.274
<v Speaker 1>to emphasize it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we could change the sentence above to </v>

189
00:10:19.711 --> 00:10:21.780
<v Speaker 1>make not the subject.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Degas,</v>

190
00:10:21.810 --> 00:10:22.830
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I alluded hail,</v>

191
00:10:23.100 --> 00:10:23.933
<v Speaker 1>notice that not is pronounced as nay </v>
<v Speaker 1>when followed by ca and the </v>

192
00:10:27.181 --> 00:10:30.690
<v Speaker 1>pronunciation of changes to God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In this sentence,</v>

193
00:10:30.780 --> 00:10:35.400
<v Speaker 1>Degas shows that I is the new </v>
<v Speaker 1>information or emphasized information.</v>

194
00:10:35.490 --> 00:10:36.323
<v Speaker 1>This might be said in response to a </v>
<v Speaker 1>question asking who plays baseball in </v>

195
00:10:39.541 --> 00:10:42.430
<v Speaker 1>English.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We might stress this subject like I play</v>

196
00:10:42.431 --> 00:10:45.390
<v Speaker 1>baseball.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's another example of when you might</v>

197
00:10:45.391 --> 00:10:46.560
<v Speaker 1>use the subject marker.</v>

198
00:10:49.430 --> 00:10:51.720
<v Speaker 1>This sentence means my mother entered </v>
<v Speaker 1>the room.</v>

199
00:10:51.990 --> 00:10:54.510
<v Speaker 1>Actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this part literally means our mother,</v>

200
00:10:54.630 --> 00:10:57.900
<v Speaker 1>but it's used to mean my when referring </v>
<v Speaker 1>to your own ingroup.</v>

201
00:10:58.170 --> 00:10:59.250
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in this case,</v>

202
00:10:59.310 --> 00:11:03.180
<v Speaker 1>my mother is new information because </v>
<v Speaker 1>before that she wasn't present,</v>

203
00:11:03.210 --> 00:11:06.330
<v Speaker 1>she wasn't in the room,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the subject particle is suitable.</v>

204
00:11:06.331 --> 00:11:07.164
<v Speaker 1>Here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this word here a is another particle </v>

205
00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:13.050
<v Speaker 1>showing direction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the English preposition to or into,</v>

206
00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:16.290
<v Speaker 1>but technically speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>since the particle comes after the Noun,</v>

207
00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:18.750
<v Speaker 1>it's a post position rather than a </v>
<v Speaker 1>preposition.</v>

208
00:11:19.530 --> 00:11:23.070
<v Speaker 1>In Korean modifiers come before the </v>
<v Speaker 1>things that they modify.</v>

209
00:11:23.190 --> 00:11:25.530
<v Speaker 1>That means that adjectives come before </v>
<v Speaker 1>nouns.</v>

210
00:11:25.780 --> 00:11:26.613
<v Speaker 1>Dual pins on this means a tall mountain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the word for tall and this is </v>

211
00:11:31.231 --> 00:11:32.064
<v Speaker 1>the word for mountain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This part connects the adjective to the </v>

212
00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:36.073
<v Speaker 1>gnome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Longer modifiers also come before the </v>

213
00:11:38.761 --> 00:11:40.260
<v Speaker 1>noun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want them to modify it.</v>

214
00:11:40.650 --> 00:11:42.270
<v Speaker 1>This phrase means the mountain.</v>

215
00:11:42.270 --> 00:11:43.830
<v Speaker 1>I want to climb.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Degas,</v>

216
00:11:43.831 --> 00:11:44.990
<v Speaker 1>older bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pleasanton,</v>

217
00:11:45.450 --> 00:11:48.420
<v Speaker 1>word for word.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This phrase is I subject marker.</v>

218
00:11:48.450 --> 00:11:50.850
<v Speaker 1>Climb,</v>
<v Speaker 1>want connector mountain.</v>

219
00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:53.160
<v Speaker 1>But if we take the whole modifying </v>
<v Speaker 1>clause,</v>

220
00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:54.153
<v Speaker 1>a single unit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this modifier plus Noun pattern is like </v>

221
00:11:56.741 --> 00:11:59.080
<v Speaker 1>saying the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to climb the mountain.</v>

222
00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:02.620
<v Speaker 1>So whereas in English,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the modifier would come after the nouns.</v>

223
00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:04.210
<v Speaker 1>In Korean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it comes before.</v>

224
00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:06.850
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this sentence could mean a mountain.</v>

225
00:12:06.851 --> 00:12:07.684
<v Speaker 1>I want to climb with indefinite meaning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Korean doesn't have definite or </v>

226
00:12:11.111 --> 00:12:11.944
<v Speaker 1>indefinite articles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So definiteness can be understood from </v>

227
00:12:14.111 --> 00:12:14.944
<v Speaker 1>context verbs and adjectives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every sentence in Korean must end in </v>

228
00:12:18.971 --> 00:12:19.804
<v Speaker 1>either a verb or an adjective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and verbs and adjectives act very </v>

229
00:12:22.451 --> 00:12:25.570
<v Speaker 1>similar to each other in Korean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with both being conjugated,</v>

230
00:12:25.571 --> 00:12:26.404
<v Speaker 1>for pastor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>non past and for different politeness </v>

231
00:12:28.091 --> 00:12:29.350
<v Speaker 1>levels.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First,</v>

232
00:12:29.351 --> 00:12:30.184
<v Speaker 1>let's look at verbs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The dictionary form of verbs all end in </v>

233
00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:33.970
<v Speaker 1>de,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

234
00:12:33.971 --> 00:12:38.971
<v Speaker 1>this verb meaning to stop and this verb </v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning to sleep.</v>

235
00:12:40.030 --> 00:12:40.863
<v Speaker 1>In order to conjugate these verbs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you remove and you are left with the </v>

236
00:12:44.111 --> 00:12:44.944
<v Speaker 1>verb stem which you add affixes to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's conjugate these verbs in the </v>

237
00:12:48.551 --> 00:12:51.370
<v Speaker 1>present tense or non past tense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To be precise.</v>

238
00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:56.050
<v Speaker 1>This sentence means he stops eating </v>
<v Speaker 1>coonamble d'amato.</v>

239
00:12:56.330 --> 00:13:00.490
<v Speaker 1>So look at how we conjugate the verb to </v>
<v Speaker 1>stop the stem is model.</v>

240
00:13:00.730 --> 00:13:03.250
<v Speaker 1>The informal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>present tense ending is ah,</v>

241
00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:06.730
<v Speaker 1>and the polite suffix is your.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this is the informal,</v>

242
00:13:06.731 --> 00:13:10.730
<v Speaker 1>polite conjugation for verb stems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whose final vowel sound is awful,</v>

243
00:13:10.870 --> 00:13:13.150
<v Speaker 1>or Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this verb ends in a consonant,</v>

244
00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:17.110
<v Speaker 1>but when the verb ends in a vowel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then only you'll is added.</v>

245
00:13:17.320 --> 00:13:19.300
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Coonan's Hale,</v>

246
00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:20.313
<v Speaker 1>he sleeps notes that with either of </v>
<v Speaker 1>these verbs you could remove your to </v>

247
00:13:25.241 --> 00:13:28.120
<v Speaker 1>make an informal non polite sentence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>

248
00:13:28.121 --> 00:13:28.954
<v Speaker 1>a more casual sentence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If the stem ends in it's replaced with </v>

249
00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:34.233
<v Speaker 1>audio.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's an example with the verb meaning </v>

250
00:13:35.890 --> 00:13:37.510
<v Speaker 1>to try and sit down.</v>

251
00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:41.260
<v Speaker 1>Could do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In this sentence means they try.</v>

252
00:13:42.430 --> 00:13:47.430
<v Speaker 1>If the last vegetable of the stem is all</v>
<v Speaker 1>or eat or a combined vowel,</v>

253
00:13:47.950 --> 00:13:50.620
<v Speaker 1>then or are y'all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is added to the stem.</v>

254
00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.770
<v Speaker 1>Look down again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have the verb meaning to eat.</v>

255
00:13:54.580 --> 00:13:55.413
<v Speaker 1>Non In this sentence means I eat pogie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's take a look at how the past tense </v>

256
00:14:01.271 --> 00:14:04.270
<v Speaker 1>is formed by changing some of those </v>
<v Speaker 1>sentences into the past.</v>

257
00:14:04.570 --> 00:14:07.650
<v Speaker 1>Before we had this sentence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cunanan look on io,</v>

258
00:14:08.020 --> 00:14:10.570
<v Speaker 1>meaning he stops eating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's change this to.</v>

259
00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:13.930
<v Speaker 1>He stopped eating in the past Coonan </v>
<v Speaker 1>sale.</v>

260
00:14:14.860 --> 00:14:19.510
<v Speaker 1>He Sleeps Coonan tail,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he slept coconut soil.</v>

261
00:14:20.050 --> 00:14:22.780
<v Speaker 1>Let's remove the polite suffix,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your for a moment.</v>

262
00:14:23.020 --> 00:14:23.853
<v Speaker 1>Notice that the past tense form equals </v>
<v Speaker 1>the present tense form with this affix </v>

263
00:14:27.520 --> 00:14:32.520
<v Speaker 1>saw attached then to make it polite,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can add your future tense.</v>

264
00:14:33.520 --> 00:14:35.860
<v Speaker 1>Korean technically doesn't have a future</v>
<v Speaker 1>tense,</v>

265
00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:36.753
<v Speaker 1>only passed and non passed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there are ways to express the </v>

266
00:14:39.491 --> 00:14:41.380
<v Speaker 1>future,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the most common being,</v>

267
00:14:41.381 --> 00:14:42.850
<v Speaker 1>the probable future for them.</v>

268
00:14:43.030 --> 00:14:43.863
<v Speaker 1>To use the probable future form,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you add a little cardio to the verb </v>

269
00:14:47.081 --> 00:14:52.081
<v Speaker 1>stem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>None in this sentence means I'm going to</v>

270
00:14:52.281 --> 00:14:53.114
<v Speaker 1>eat Takagi.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When talking about things aside from </v>

271
00:14:55.191 --> 00:14:56.024
<v Speaker 1>yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the probable future refers to things </v>

272
00:14:57.801 --> 00:15:01.370
<v Speaker 1>that you think are likely to happen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when referring to yourself,</v>

273
00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:03.920
<v Speaker 1>it shows determination rather than </v>
<v Speaker 1>speculation.</v>

274
00:15:04.010 --> 00:15:08.720
<v Speaker 1>So we can translate this as I'm going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>eat typography or I shall eat meat.</v>

275
00:15:08.840 --> 00:15:09.673
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm probably pronouncing this word to </v>

276
00:15:11.210 --> 00:15:13.010
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way it's pronounced in Japanese.</v>

277
00:15:13.190 --> 00:15:14.023
<v Speaker 1>I live in Japan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I've eaten a lot more top pogie here </v>

278
00:15:15.801 --> 00:15:16.634
<v Speaker 1>than in Korea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Adjectives when an adjective is in the </v>

279
00:15:18.951 --> 00:15:20.870
<v Speaker 1>predicative position,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in other words,</v>

280
00:15:20.930 --> 00:15:21.763
<v Speaker 1>after the subject,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then it functions similarly to a verb </v>

281
00:15:24.350 --> 00:15:26.920
<v Speaker 1>and is conjugated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Honeydew Pio,</v>

282
00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:30.260
<v Speaker 1>the sentence means the mountain is tall,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the present tense,</v>

283
00:15:30.290 --> 00:15:33.470
<v Speaker 1>affix and polite affix are added to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>adjective stem,</v>

284
00:15:33.740 --> 00:15:34.573
<v Speaker 1>just like a verb,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we can make this past tense to </v>

285
00:15:37.820 --> 00:15:37.930
<v Speaker 1>honeymoon.</v>

286
00:15:37.930 --> 00:15:40.340
<v Speaker 1>Paso,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the mountain was tall.</v>

287
00:15:40.580 --> 00:15:41.413
<v Speaker 1>This is conjugated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just like the past tense verb speech </v>

288
00:15:44.331 --> 00:15:45.164
<v Speaker 1>levels.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When looking at verbs in the previous </v>

289
00:15:46.671 --> 00:15:47.504
<v Speaker 1>section,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we looked mainly at the informal polite </v>

290
00:15:49.401 --> 00:15:50.234
<v Speaker 1>forms of verbs like Mateo from my Ada </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I briefly mentioned that we could </v>

291
00:15:55.401 --> 00:15:59.810
<v Speaker 1>make the informal non polite form by </v>
<v Speaker 1>removing your like Mata.</v>

292
00:16:00.140 --> 00:16:03.050
<v Speaker 1>These are two of seven politeness levels</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Korean.</v>

293
00:16:03.410 --> 00:16:04.850
<v Speaker 1>Luckily for learners,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not all,</v>

294
00:16:04.851 --> 00:16:09.080
<v Speaker 1>seven of them are commonly used,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three or maybe four are commonly used.</v>

295
00:16:09.290 --> 00:16:11.180
<v Speaker 1>The other two are formal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>polite,</v>

296
00:16:11.360 --> 00:16:13.100
<v Speaker 1>Manzanita,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and formal,</v>

297
00:16:13.101 --> 00:16:13.934
<v Speaker 1>non polite Munda.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The informal polite form is used when </v>

298
00:16:17.931 --> 00:16:22.040
<v Speaker 1>speaking to friends and acquaintances.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Colleagues have a similar status to you,</v>

299
00:16:22.100 --> 00:16:23.420
<v Speaker 1>shop staff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>et Cetera.</v>

300
00:16:23.900 --> 00:16:28.010
<v Speaker 1>The informal non polite form is used </v>
<v Speaker 1>when speaking to very close friends,</v>

301
00:16:28.040 --> 00:16:28.873
<v Speaker 1>a brother or sister,</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone a few years younger than you or </v>

302
00:16:31.161 --> 00:16:31.994
<v Speaker 1>someone you want to be rude to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The formal polite form is used when </v>

303
00:16:35.241 --> 00:16:36.074
<v Speaker 1>speaking to someone of higher status </v>
<v Speaker 1>than you and people you are meeting for </v>

304
00:16:38.751 --> 00:16:39.584
<v Speaker 1>the first time.</v>

305
00:16:40.370 --> 00:16:41.203
<v Speaker 1>The formal non polite form is basically </v>
<v Speaker 1>a neutral forum that you can use when </v>

306
00:16:44.421 --> 00:16:46.580
<v Speaker 1>you don't know who the reader or </v>
<v Speaker 1>listener is.</v>

307
00:16:46.850 --> 00:16:47.683
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're speaking to many types of </v>

308
00:16:48.891 --> 00:16:49.724
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it can also be used in speaking to </v>

309
00:16:51.171 --> 00:16:55.340
<v Speaker 1>friends of the same age range.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's look at a couple more sentences in</v>

310
00:16:55.341 --> 00:16:59.390
<v Speaker 1>Korean and see what we find.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This sentence means I have a bicycle but</v>

311
00:16:59.391 --> 00:17:00.224
<v Speaker 1>I don't have a car.</v>
<v Speaker 1>None in has he been tackled so word for </v>

312
00:17:04.941 --> 00:17:08.630
<v Speaker 1>word it's I topic marker,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bicycle Subject Marker.</v>

313
00:17:08.720 --> 00:17:11.300
<v Speaker 1>There is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but car subject marker.</v>

314
00:17:11.360 --> 00:17:12.193
<v Speaker 1>There isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This sentence shows us how to express </v>

315
00:17:14.121 --> 00:17:14.954
<v Speaker 1>possession or have in Korean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The topic of the sentence is the </v>

316
00:17:17.991 --> 00:17:18.824
<v Speaker 1>possessor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then the thing that is possessed is the </v>

317
00:17:20.721 --> 00:17:21.554
<v Speaker 1>subject of the sentence with a subject </v>
<v Speaker 1>marker followed by the existence verb </v>

318
00:17:24.920 --> 00:17:25.753
<v Speaker 1>meaning there is or there are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then we start a new sentence with but </v>

319
00:17:29.090 --> 00:17:29.923
<v Speaker 1>and there is a subject car with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>subject marker followed by the negative </v>

320
00:17:33.321 --> 00:17:34.370
<v Speaker 1>verb of existence.</v>

321
00:17:34.430 --> 00:17:35.263
<v Speaker 1>Meaning there isn't or there aren't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Notice that there's no topic in the </v>

322
00:17:38.091 --> 00:17:41.150
<v Speaker 1>second sentence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The topic can be skipped if it's already</v>

323
00:17:41.151 --> 00:17:43.100
<v Speaker 1>clear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Another sentence.</v>

324
00:17:43.370 --> 00:17:46.070
<v Speaker 1>This means this food is delicious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you cook it?</v>

325
00:17:46.250 --> 00:17:49.980
<v Speaker 1>You Michigan?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Less so the word for word,</v>

326
00:17:49.981 --> 00:17:53.310
<v Speaker 1>it's this food topic marker,</v>
<v Speaker 1>delicious,</v>

327
00:17:53.430 --> 00:17:54.360
<v Speaker 1>informal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>polite,</v>

328
00:17:54.430 --> 00:17:56.220
<v Speaker 1>conjugation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You subject,</v>

329
00:17:56.221 --> 00:17:58.650
<v Speaker 1>marker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cooking did informal,</v>

330
00:17:58.680 --> 00:17:59.513
<v Speaker 1>non polite conjugation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This first sentence follows a very </v>

331
00:18:01.891 --> 00:18:02.724
<v Speaker 1>common pattern.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's the subject which is also the </v>

332
00:18:04.621 --> 00:18:05.454
<v Speaker 1>topic of the sentence with a topic </v>
<v Speaker 1>marker and before the known we can see </v>

333
00:18:08.491 --> 00:18:09.324
<v Speaker 1>the demonstrative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He meaning this and here we have the </v>

334
00:18:11.701 --> 00:18:14.010
<v Speaker 1>adjective which is conjugated like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>verb.</v>

335
00:18:14.280 --> 00:18:17.220
<v Speaker 1>In the second sentence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the subject is the word for you,</v>

336
00:18:17.250 --> 00:18:18.083
<v Speaker 1>followed by the subject marker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ca Yodlee is the word for cooking or </v>

337
00:18:21.661 --> 00:18:23.820
<v Speaker 1>cuisine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and [inaudible] is the verb.</v>

338
00:18:23.821 --> 00:18:26.970
<v Speaker 1>Meaning do conjugated in the past tense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>informal,</v>

339
00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:27.833
<v Speaker 1>non polite form.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the same as the informal polite </v>

340
00:18:30.121 --> 00:18:30.954
<v Speaker 1>form with the syllable you'll removed </v>
<v Speaker 1>from the end of both sentences when </v>

341
00:18:35.191 --> 00:18:36.570
<v Speaker 1>talking directly to someone.</v>

342
00:18:36.600 --> 00:18:39.030
<v Speaker 1>It's very common to drop the subject.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pronouns,</v>

343
00:18:39.090 --> 00:18:41.100
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>God is so,</v>

344
00:18:41.580 --> 00:18:42.413
<v Speaker 1>but in this case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the subject and subject marker ca are </v>

345
00:18:44.701 --> 00:18:49.170
<v Speaker 1>included to emphasize you like did you </v>
<v Speaker 1>cook it as opposed to someone else?</v>

346
00:18:49.350 --> 00:18:50.183
<v Speaker 1>Next,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we see something very common and </v>

347
00:18:51.331 --> 00:18:52.410
<v Speaker 1>important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In Korean,</v>

348
00:18:52.620 --> 00:18:55.050
<v Speaker 1>we have a verb that consists of two </v>
<v Speaker 1>parts,</v>

349
00:18:55.200 --> 00:18:57.750
<v Speaker 1>unknown of Chinese origin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>followed by the verb,</v>

350
00:18:58.530 --> 00:19:00.900
<v Speaker 1>which means to do or to make.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Many,</v>

351
00:19:00.901 --> 00:19:03.090
<v Speaker 1>many Korean verbs are constructed this </v>
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>

352
00:19:03.390 --> 00:19:06.060
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eda meaning to work,</v>

353
00:19:07.380 --> 00:19:08.213
<v Speaker 1>meaning to study.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are also some words of English </v>

354
00:19:10.081 --> 00:19:11.880
<v Speaker 1>origin that form verbs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This way,</v>

355
00:19:12.030 --> 00:19:15.090
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how will have meaning to shower.</v>

356
00:19:16.470 --> 00:19:17.303
<v Speaker 1>Let's look at one last sentence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can you tune this sentence means she is </v>

357
00:19:22.171 --> 00:19:25.770
<v Speaker 1>a good student word for word,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's she topic marker.</v>

358
00:19:25.950 --> 00:19:29.490
<v Speaker 1>Good connector student.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Be Informal,</v>

359
00:19:29.491 --> 00:19:30.324
<v Speaker 1>polite.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So here we have the subject which is </v>

360
00:19:31.921 --> 00:19:33.990
<v Speaker 1>also the topic with a topic marker.</v>

361
00:19:34.080 --> 00:19:37.950
<v Speaker 1>Then we have the adjective meaning good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and since it comes before the gnome,</v>

362
00:19:37.980 --> 00:19:38.813
<v Speaker 1>there's a connector.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Huck saying means student and the verb </v>

363
00:19:41.340 --> 00:19:44.580
<v Speaker 1>is at the end.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This verb is the informal polite form of</v>

364
00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:45.473
<v Speaker 1>EDA,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which basically means to be and usually </v>

365
00:19:47.731 --> 00:19:48.564
<v Speaker 1>comes after nouns.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's also a negative form of this </v>

366
00:19:51.271 --> 00:19:52.440
<v Speaker 1>verb,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anita,</v>

367
00:19:52.740 --> 00:19:56.430
<v Speaker 1>so we could make this sentence negative </v>
<v Speaker 1>like this Cunanan swoon.</v>

368
00:19:58.200 --> 00:20:00.810
<v Speaker 1>Now the sentence means she is not a good</v>
<v Speaker 1>student.</v>

369
00:20:01.430 --> 00:20:03.840
<v Speaker 1>Noticed that in the negative form of </v>
<v Speaker 1>this sentence,</v>

370
00:20:03.900 --> 00:20:06.660
<v Speaker 1>the subject marker,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he comes after us saying,</v>

371
00:20:06.780 --> 00:20:07.613
<v Speaker 1>so with this particular verb,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have the topic and then the </v>

372
00:20:10.231 --> 00:20:13.170
<v Speaker 1>compliment actually becomes the subject </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the sentence.</v>

373
00:20:14.040 --> 00:20:14.873
<v Speaker 1>There's really so much more I could say </v>
<v Speaker 1>about Korean and there's no way I can </v>

374
00:20:17.251 --> 00:20:18.084
<v Speaker 1>cover everything in a single video,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but hopefully that gave you a taste of </v>

375
00:20:20.791 --> 00:20:23.550
<v Speaker 1>the language and sparked your interest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In some ways,</v>

376
00:20:23.580 --> 00:20:25.980
<v Speaker 1>Korean is strikingly similar to </v>
<v Speaker 1>Japanese,</v>

377
00:20:26.010 --> 00:20:26.843
<v Speaker 1>but in some ways it's quite different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You might want to check out my video </v>

378
00:20:29.311 --> 00:20:30.144
<v Speaker 1>from a couple of years ago on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>differences and similarities between </v>

379
00:20:32.791 --> 00:20:35.340
<v Speaker 1>Korean and Japanese.</v>
