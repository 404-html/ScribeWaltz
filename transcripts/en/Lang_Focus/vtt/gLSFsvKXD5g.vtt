00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:05.040
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] been definitely towards </v>
<v Speaker 1>canal.</v>

2
00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.310
<v Speaker 1>Good evening folks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Today I want to talk about uh,</v>

3
00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.740
<v Speaker 1>studying Japanese and the most useful </v>
<v Speaker 1>materials for learning Japanese.</v>

4
00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:20.813
<v Speaker 1>Obviously I haven't used all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>different materials in the world for </v>

5
00:00:24.061 --> 00:00:24.894
<v Speaker 1>studying Japanese,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I have to do some and that's </v>

6
00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:27.203
<v Speaker 1>familiar with others to some extent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'll tell you about what I think and </v>

7
00:00:30.061 --> 00:00:30.894
<v Speaker 1>my experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the good things about studying </v>

8
00:00:33.001 --> 00:00:36.990
<v Speaker 1>Japanese is that there is such a wide </v>
<v Speaker 1>range of good materials.</v>

9
00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.710
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's just,</v>

10
00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:38.543
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot out there to choose from.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you can go to the bookstore and look </v>

11
00:00:40.801 --> 00:00:43.500
<v Speaker 1>through a bunch of books and see which </v>
<v Speaker 1>ones appeal to you.</v>

12
00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:44.813
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it comes down to learning style and </v>

13
00:00:45.901 --> 00:00:49.050
<v Speaker 1>taste to some extent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'll just get into it.</v>

14
00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:49.903
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first series that I used was called </v>

15
00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:54.390
<v Speaker 1>Japanese for busy people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there are,</v>

16
00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:56.520
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well the title was always kind of funny.</v>

17
00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.340
<v Speaker 1>I don't know why it's for busy people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why not for business people?</v>

18
00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.240
<v Speaker 1>The content of this series is basically </v>
<v Speaker 1>for business.</v>

19
00:01:03.241 --> 00:01:04.074
<v Speaker 1>It's for simple business situations </v>
<v Speaker 1>where like do you go on a business trip </v>

20
00:01:07.681 --> 00:01:10.710
<v Speaker 1>to Tokyo when you talked to like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what was it,</v>

21
00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:11.993
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mr Tanaka from Tokyo Electric and that </v>

22
00:01:14.281 --> 00:01:16.320
<v Speaker 1>kind of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the situations are kind of business.</v>

23
00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:17.543
<v Speaker 1>I found that aspect of it a little </v>
<v Speaker 1>boring because I was never working in </v>

24
00:01:21.031 --> 00:01:23.550
<v Speaker 1>business in Japan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I came here as a teacher,</v>

25
00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.060
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that it might not be relevant for you</v>

26
00:01:27.061 --> 00:01:27.894
<v Speaker 1>in terms of content and completely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's a good series and if you go </v>

27
00:01:30.481 --> 00:01:32.520
<v Speaker 1>through volumes one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two and maybe three,</v>

28
00:01:32.521 --> 00:01:34.050
<v Speaker 1>you'll learn quite a bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

29
00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:35.730
<v Speaker 1>it's quite well laid out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

30
00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.940
<v Speaker 1>it has like a short conversation in each</v>
<v Speaker 1>chapter.</v>

31
00:01:38.941 --> 00:01:42.510
<v Speaker 1>Then it introduces the vocabulary and </v>
<v Speaker 1>some grammar from,</v>

32
00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:43.643
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from that conversation and gives you </v>

33
00:01:44.491 --> 00:01:46.020
<v Speaker 1>some exercises to practice it.</v>

34
00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:47.700
<v Speaker 1>And it's quite,</v>
<v Speaker 1>quite good,</v>

35
00:01:47.701 --> 00:01:49.680
<v Speaker 1>useful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>standard Japanese.</v>

36
00:01:49.681 --> 00:01:52.290
<v Speaker 1>And I think it's a good series.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

37
00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.290
<v Speaker 1>there's another popular series called,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

38
00:01:55.291 --> 00:01:58.740
<v Speaker 1>it's called [inaudible] or a Japanese </v>
<v Speaker 1>for every one.</v>

39
00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.060
<v Speaker 1>And that one is quite good as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I haven't used the whole thing,</v>

40
00:02:03.061 --> 00:02:05.430
<v Speaker 1>but I've looked through it and it looks </v>
<v Speaker 1>quite good.</v>

41
00:02:05.431 --> 00:02:09.270
<v Speaker 1>And a lot of people swear by it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's another one to think about is,</v>

42
00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:13.050
<v Speaker 1>I mean Danone Hong Kong or Japanese for </v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone as it's called.</v>

43
00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:17.910
<v Speaker 1>Another series I used was one that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>only published in Vancouver.</v>

44
00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:21.750
<v Speaker 1>It's published at a Japanese language </v>
<v Speaker 1>school in Vancouver,</v>

45
00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:26.180
<v Speaker 1>I think it's called Nakagawa language </v>
<v Speaker 1>center and it's called gum bucket.</v>

46
00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:28.440
<v Speaker 1>That's the name of the series.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that one was really good.</v>

47
00:02:28.441 --> 00:02:30.420
<v Speaker 1>It was really fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was really motivating.</v>

48
00:02:30.421 --> 00:02:31.254
<v Speaker 1>I really liked that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The best as a like a pure beginners </v>

49
00:02:33.871 --> 00:02:36.360
<v Speaker 1>textbook or five volumes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>five volumes.</v>

50
00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:38.700
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>number one is really simple,</v>

51
00:02:38.701 --> 00:02:41.700
<v Speaker 1>but it goes up to five and if you finish</v>
<v Speaker 1>up to volume five,</v>

52
00:02:41.701 --> 00:02:44.900
<v Speaker 1>that prepares you for the first level of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Japanese proficiency test.</v>

53
00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:46.063
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but all the conversations and the </v>

54
00:02:46.771 --> 00:02:51.150
<v Speaker 1>characters and stuff were quite cute and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm quite motivating.</v>

55
00:02:51.151 --> 00:02:53.760
<v Speaker 1>They got me interested in learning </v>
<v Speaker 1>Japanese more.</v>

56
00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:55.710
<v Speaker 1>Let me just double check the name of </v>
<v Speaker 1>that center.</v>

57
00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:56.911
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not knock a Gullah,</v>

58
00:02:56.911 --> 00:03:01.060
<v Speaker 1>sorry to Nina Ogawa Japanese language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's hard to get those books.</v>

59
00:03:01.061 --> 00:03:04.240
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you can find the </v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] gum but day series,</v>

60
00:03:04.241 --> 00:03:05.074
<v Speaker 1>but if you can find it online,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you can order it through the </v>

61
00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:11.710
<v Speaker 1>website of new gala.com.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So have a look if you can get it.</v>

62
00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:14.950
<v Speaker 1>It's good for beginners,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least the lower levels.</v>

63
00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:18.850
<v Speaker 1>So those were the beginning textbooks at</v>
<v Speaker 1>an intermediate level.</v>

64
00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:19.923
<v Speaker 1>I loved this book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this one and integrated approach to </v>

65
00:03:22.691 --> 00:03:25.780
<v Speaker 1>intermediate Japanese by a Kiddo Muda.</v>

66
00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:30.070
<v Speaker 1>And now when we Hanukkah mcgloin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this one was awesome.</v>

67
00:03:30.071 --> 00:03:32.410
<v Speaker 1>This made me really love studying </v>
<v Speaker 1>Japanese.</v>

68
00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:34.810
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way it was laid out.</v>

69
00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:37.150
<v Speaker 1>The conversations were fun and </v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting.</v>

70
00:03:37.151 --> 00:03:41.290
<v Speaker 1>The stories and texts were interesting </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it wasn't focused on business.</v>

71
00:03:41.291 --> 00:03:44.560
<v Speaker 1>It was focused on college life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I wasn't a student,</v>

72
00:03:44.561 --> 00:03:45.394
<v Speaker 1>but I had been a student so I could </v>
<v Speaker 1>relate to college life a little bit </v>

73
00:03:47.891 --> 00:03:51.730
<v Speaker 1>better than corporate life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the vocab and the topics and just the</v>

74
00:03:51.731 --> 00:03:54.550
<v Speaker 1>whole theme of this book was more </v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting to me.</v>

75
00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:56.073
<v Speaker 1>Some people don't seem to like it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've read some of the reviews on Amazon </v>

76
00:03:58.391 --> 00:04:00.520
<v Speaker 1>and some people say they find it hard to</v>
<v Speaker 1>follow.</v>

77
00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:02.830
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it might depend on your learning style.</v>

78
00:04:02.831 --> 00:04:03.664
<v Speaker 1>Like I'm a very inductive learner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like to look at texts and </v>

79
00:04:05.741 --> 00:04:09.160
<v Speaker 1>conversations and kind of figure out </v>
<v Speaker 1>what's going on and look at the pieces.</v>

80
00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:10.990
<v Speaker 1>And God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this piece must be the verb.</v>

81
00:04:10.991 --> 00:04:13.870
<v Speaker 1>This must be the whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like to figure things out.</v>

82
00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:15.153
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that works well with this book </v>

83
00:04:17.081 --> 00:04:19.960
<v Speaker 1>because it's the beginning of each </v>
<v Speaker 1>chapter and it will have like,</v>

84
00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:20.863
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like two or three different </v>

85
00:04:21.641 --> 00:04:24.430
<v Speaker 1>conversations or texts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if we look at this one,</v>

86
00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:28.120
<v Speaker 1>it's got one conversation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then it's got another one,</v>

87
00:04:28.121 --> 00:04:31.720
<v Speaker 1>then it's got another one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then after that it's got a text.</v>

88
00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:34.450
<v Speaker 1>And then after that it has the </v>
<v Speaker 1>vocabulary.</v>

89
00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:36.640
<v Speaker 1>And after the vocabulary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then it has,</v>

90
00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:39.790
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the congee.</v>

91
00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:41.103
<v Speaker 1>Then after that it has the grammar </v>
<v Speaker 1>points and then it has a grammar </v>

92
00:04:42.881 --> 00:04:44.720
<v Speaker 1>exercises.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the,</v>

93
00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:45.643
<v Speaker 1>the texts and the conversations are </v>
<v Speaker 1>separate from all of the breakdown and </v>

94
00:04:49.841 --> 00:04:52.870
<v Speaker 1>the explanation and the exercises.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those come after the texts.</v>

95
00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:54.550
<v Speaker 1>So for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's fine.</v>

96
00:04:54.551 --> 00:04:55.384
<v Speaker 1>I like to look at the text and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>conversations and then flip back to the </v>

97
00:04:58.061 --> 00:04:59.350
<v Speaker 1>explanations when I need it.</v>

98
00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:00.303
<v Speaker 1>And then I can figure out the other </v>
<v Speaker 1>things on my own to whatever extent I </v>

99
00:05:03.641 --> 00:05:04.474
<v Speaker 1>can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then I can just flip back if I need an </v>

100
00:05:05.681 --> 00:05:08.230
<v Speaker 1>explanation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some people like to have the explanation</v>

101
00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:10.270
<v Speaker 1>right up front in their face from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>beginning.</v>

102
00:05:10.271 --> 00:05:12.430
<v Speaker 1>They're more deductive learners.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

103
00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:16.660
<v Speaker 1>they like to have it explained to them </v>
<v Speaker 1>before they read the text or at the same</v>

104
00:05:16.661 --> 00:05:18.970
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you are like that,</v>

105
00:05:18.971 --> 00:05:21.670
<v Speaker 1>you might not like this book that much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but have a look at it.</v>

106
00:05:21.671 --> 00:05:24.250
<v Speaker 1>I really liked it and this was my </v>
<v Speaker 1>favorite book ever.</v>

107
00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:28.360
<v Speaker 1>So another one at the intermediate level</v>
<v Speaker 1>was this one,</v>

108
00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:31.510
<v Speaker 1>which I didn't like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't have as much fun with it,</v>

109
00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:33.700
<v Speaker 1>but it was useful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It taught me a lot.</v>

110
00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:35.050
<v Speaker 1>It's this one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

111
00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:37.310
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible],</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

112
00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:40.330
<v Speaker 1>that means Japanese from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>intermediate level.</v>

113
00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:42.670
<v Speaker 1>That's the name,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the meaning of this title.</v>

114
00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:47.910
<v Speaker 1>But this one is completely in Japanese.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This other one and integrated approach.</v>

115
00:05:48.401 --> 00:05:49.234
<v Speaker 1>The one I showed you before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this has a lot of English in it and has </v>

116
00:05:50.891 --> 00:05:54.550
<v Speaker 1>translations and explanations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This one is all in Japanese.</v>

117
00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:56.690
<v Speaker 1>So this one is a bit more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

118
00:05:56.750 --> 00:05:59.570
<v Speaker 1>intense of an experience because you </v>
<v Speaker 1>have to dive right in.</v>

119
00:05:59.571 --> 00:06:01.400
<v Speaker 1>It's all Japanese,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no explanations.</v>

120
00:06:01.401 --> 00:06:04.910
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't even have a title in English.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I looked this up on Amazon to check</v>

121
00:06:04.911 --> 00:06:06.440
<v Speaker 1>if it's available,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

122
00:06:06.441 --> 00:06:07.380
<v Speaker 1>I had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

123
00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:11.390
<v Speaker 1>I had to type in the espn number because</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I typed in the Japanese,</v>

124
00:06:11.391 --> 00:06:13.940
<v Speaker 1>it didn't show up because it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>amazon.com</v>

125
00:06:13.941 --> 00:06:15.560
<v Speaker 1>in America.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

126
00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:17.450
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I looked up the espn,</v>

127
00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:18.313
<v Speaker 1>then this name,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this title appeared in Roman characters </v>

128
00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:23.480
<v Speaker 1>in Amazon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it doesn't even have an English name.</v>

129
00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:25.180
<v Speaker 1>You would have to look up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

130
00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:28.580
<v Speaker 1>maybe I'll put the ISB and on the screen</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you can look it up if you want.</v>

131
00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:30.410
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this one's good.</v>

132
00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:32.570
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it has great texts.</v>

133
00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:35.420
<v Speaker 1>The texts are interesting stories and </v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

134
00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:38.740
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of stories and there's,</v>

135
00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:43.370
<v Speaker 1>there are some explanations of proverbs </v>
<v Speaker 1>and different expressions in Japanese.</v>

136
00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:44.413
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I found it really useful to just go </v>

137
00:06:45.321 --> 00:06:48.770
<v Speaker 1>through the stories and highlight </v>
<v Speaker 1>vocabulary I didn't know,</v>

138
00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:54.070
<v Speaker 1>and then look at the vocabulary lists </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the grammar exercises after,</v>

139
00:06:56.750 --> 00:06:57.583
<v Speaker 1>after the stories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I found it a bit hard to do all of the </v>

140
00:07:00.141 --> 00:07:04.250
<v Speaker 1>exercises without a classroom teacher.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did this on my own at home.</v>

141
00:07:04.670 --> 00:07:05.503
<v Speaker 1>I've actually never taken the Japanese </v>
<v Speaker 1>lesson in my life and I did it all </v>

142
00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:09.860
<v Speaker 1>through self study.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

143
00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:14.600
<v Speaker 1>I found it a bit hard to do this all at </v>
<v Speaker 1>home self study style,</v>

144
00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:17.150
<v Speaker 1>but I got through it and it was a bit of</v>
<v Speaker 1>hard work,</v>

145
00:07:17.151 --> 00:07:19.640
<v Speaker 1>but I learned a lot from it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this one is good.</v>

146
00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:20.593
<v Speaker 1>It's good material.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just if you have a teacher it will be </v>

147
00:07:22.341 --> 00:07:24.620
<v Speaker 1>easier for you cause they can help you </v>
<v Speaker 1>out with,</v>

148
00:07:24.630 --> 00:07:25.463
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the exercises when the explanation </v>

149
00:07:27.591 --> 00:07:30.440
<v Speaker 1>in Japanese is not quite clear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

150
00:07:30.441 --> 00:07:33.380
<v Speaker 1>so that was intermediate level.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At a more advanced level.</v>

151
00:07:33.381 --> 00:07:37.700
<v Speaker 1>I used this one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a Gq collagio cue and on your own goals.</v>

152
00:07:37.701 --> 00:07:41.720
<v Speaker 1>So that's Japanese from the intermediate</v>
<v Speaker 1>level to the advanced level.</v>

153
00:07:41.721 --> 00:07:43.730
<v Speaker 1>That's what that title means.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

154
00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:44.953
<v Speaker 1>or as they say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>progressing from intermediate to </v>

155
00:07:46.881 --> 00:07:47.840
<v Speaker 1>advanced,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's uh,</v>

156
00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:51.080
<v Speaker 1>that's the way they translated it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this one was pretty good.</v>

157
00:07:51.110 --> 00:07:51.943
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was kind of a bridge between </v>

158
00:07:53.661 --> 00:07:54.494
<v Speaker 1>intermediate to advanced.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got about halfway through this book </v>

159
00:07:57.080 --> 00:07:58.730
<v Speaker 1>and it was good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was useful.</v>

160
00:07:58.731 --> 00:08:00.250
<v Speaker 1>I learned a lot from it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

161
00:08:00.530 --> 00:08:01.363
<v Speaker 1>but I started using authentic materials.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Instead I started just using newspapers </v>

162
00:08:04.881 --> 00:08:07.550
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and texts from magazines and just trying</v>

163
00:08:07.551 --> 00:08:09.470
<v Speaker 1>to work through those and learn </v>
<v Speaker 1>vocabulary.</v>

164
00:08:09.980 --> 00:08:11.840
<v Speaker 1>But this is good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's similar to the,</v>

165
00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:15.770
<v Speaker 1>to the integrated approach to </v>
<v Speaker 1>intermediate Japanese won't like,</v>

166
00:08:15.771 --> 00:08:16.604
<v Speaker 1>it has texts that are interesting and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then it breaks it down with the vocab </v>

167
00:08:19.641 --> 00:08:22.370
<v Speaker 1>and the grammar exercises afterwards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

168
00:08:22.580 --> 00:08:26.060
<v Speaker 1>I found it quite similar in format and </v>
<v Speaker 1>just interesting to use,</v>

169
00:08:26.450 --> 00:08:27.283
<v Speaker 1>but at that level I just thought it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>better to get into the authentic </v>

170
00:08:29.901 --> 00:08:31.820
<v Speaker 1>materials.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

171
00:08:31.821 --> 00:08:32.654
<v Speaker 1>So those are the ones that I have used </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think are pretty good and I </v>

172
00:08:35.211 --> 00:08:37.370
<v Speaker 1>recommend,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've used some others here and there.</v>

173
00:08:37.660 --> 00:08:38.493
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I use some different ones for </v>

174
00:08:39.201 --> 00:08:40.034
<v Speaker 1>Congee,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I'll probably talk about in a </v>

175
00:08:41.301 --> 00:08:42.134
<v Speaker 1>different video cause Kanji is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>different beast entirely and deserves </v>

176
00:08:45.171 --> 00:08:47.930
<v Speaker 1>its own attention.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I recommend all those,</v>

177
00:08:47.990 --> 00:08:48.823
<v Speaker 1>especially this one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was my favorite integrated </v>

178
00:08:52.701 --> 00:08:55.040
<v Speaker 1>approach to intermediate Japanese.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you're a beginner,</v>

179
00:08:55.050 --> 00:08:55.883
<v Speaker 1>then you could get me not only Hong Kong</v>
<v Speaker 1>or you could get Japanese for busy </v>

180
00:08:59.131 --> 00:09:00.900
<v Speaker 1>people and work through it.</v>

181
00:09:01.170 --> 00:09:04.950
<v Speaker 1>One more note on Japanese for busy </v>
<v Speaker 1>people get the Kona version.</v>

182
00:09:05.370 --> 00:09:06.203
<v Speaker 1>Don't get the romanized version.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are to the romanized means it's </v>

183
00:09:08.821 --> 00:09:09.690
<v Speaker 1>written in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

184
00:09:09.691 --> 00:09:12.990
<v Speaker 1>it has Roman characters in it and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>think it has the Japanese as well.</v>

185
00:09:13.290 --> 00:09:14.160
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

186
00:09:14.310 --> 00:09:15.143
<v Speaker 1>I don't recommend using the romanized </v>
<v Speaker 1>version because you might use the Roman </v>

187
00:09:19.141 --> 00:09:19.974
<v Speaker 1>letters as a crutch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's good to get used to the corner </v>

188
00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:25.170
<v Speaker 1>letters right away from the beginning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just dive right in.</v>

189
00:09:25.590 --> 00:09:29.100
<v Speaker 1>You can learn them very quickly if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>dive in and make yourself do it.</v>

190
00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:31.200
<v Speaker 1>So make yourself do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

191
00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:33.540
<v Speaker 1>I hope that's helpful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have a nice night guys.</v>

192
00:09:33.690 --> 00:09:34.523
<v Speaker 1>See Ya.</v>

193
00:09:38.570 --> 00:09:39.403
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
