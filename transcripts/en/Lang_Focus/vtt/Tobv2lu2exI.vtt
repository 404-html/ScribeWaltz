00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:13.473
<v Speaker 1>Hello everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Welcome to the Lange Focus Channel and </v>

2
00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:19.030
<v Speaker 1>my name is Paul.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Today we're going to focus on a language</v>

3
00:00:19.031 --> 00:00:19.864
<v Speaker 1>called Katelyn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Katelyn is a member of the Occidental </v>

4
00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:25.120
<v Speaker 1>Romance Branch of the Romance Language </v>
<v Speaker 1>family.</v>

5
00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:26.343
<v Speaker 1>It's mainly spoken in and around </v>
<v Speaker 1>Catalonia and autonomous community in </v>

6
00:00:29.771 --> 00:00:32.740
<v Speaker 1>spin as well as in another autonomous </v>
<v Speaker 1>community,</v>

7
00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:33.723
<v Speaker 1>the Balearic islands,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and also in the autonomous community of </v>

8
00:00:36.731 --> 00:00:37.564
<v Speaker 1>Valencia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But some people will definitely dispute </v>

9
00:00:39.851 --> 00:00:40.684
<v Speaker 1>that many members of the Valencian </v>
<v Speaker 1>community will insist that they speak a </v>

10
00:00:44.141 --> 00:00:46.900
<v Speaker 1>separate language called Valencia and </v>
<v Speaker 1>others,</v>

11
00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:47.763
<v Speaker 1>including most linguists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>simply considered Valencian to be a </v>

12
00:00:50.291 --> 00:00:52.210
<v Speaker 1>collection of cattle and dialects.</v>

13
00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:55.613
<v Speaker 2>Amanda,</v>

14
00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.550
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

15
00:01:00.551 --> 00:01:03.460
<v Speaker 1>let's leave that issue aside for now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But in any case,</v>

16
00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:04.323
<v Speaker 1>in all three of those autonomous </v>
<v Speaker 1>communities cancel on his co official </v>

17
00:01:07.391 --> 00:01:08.224
<v Speaker 1>with Spanish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>except in Valencia where it's co </v>

18
00:01:10.521 --> 00:01:13.270
<v Speaker 1>official,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a Spanish under the name Valencian.</v>

19
00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:15.790
<v Speaker 1>Oh Man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This video just started and I've already</v>

20
00:01:15.791 --> 00:01:16.624
<v Speaker 1>got a headache.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cattle land has also spoken in the tiny </v>

21
00:01:18.701 --> 00:01:19.534
<v Speaker 1>principality of Endora,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is located in the Pyrenees </v>

22
00:01:22.061 --> 00:01:25.960
<v Speaker 1>mountains and is bordered by France to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the north and Spain to the self.</v>

23
00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:29.230
<v Speaker 1>Kendall land has also spoken across the </v>
<v Speaker 1>border in France,</v>

24
00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:30.093
<v Speaker 1>in the northern Catalonia region.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cattle land is closely related to </v>

25
00:01:32.891 --> 00:01:33.724
<v Speaker 1>Oxytocin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is spoken in areas of France </v>

26
00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:38.440
<v Speaker 1>adjacent to northern Catalonia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In the past,</v>

27
00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:42.760
<v Speaker 1>Katelyn and oxidant were considered to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be dialect groups of the same language,</v>

28
00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:45.370
<v Speaker 1>but they're now widely considered to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>independent.</v>

29
00:01:45.371 --> 00:01:48.370
<v Speaker 1>Sister languages have the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>Occidental Romance branch.</v>

30
00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:52.300
<v Speaker 1>Katelyn has also spoken in the town of </v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] ghetto in Sardinia,</v>

31
00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:53.020
<v Speaker 1>Italy.</v>

32
00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:55.390
<v Speaker 1>Katelyn is spoken by over 10 million </v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

33
00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:56.283
<v Speaker 1>some of whom indisputable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He speak it as a native language and </v>

34
00:01:58.631 --> 00:02:00.670
<v Speaker 1>some of whom speak another language at </v>
<v Speaker 1>home,</v>

35
00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:01.533
<v Speaker 1>usually Spanish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but are also fluent in cattle land and </v>

36
00:02:03.581 --> 00:02:06.190
<v Speaker 1>speak at at a native level because of </v>
<v Speaker 1>their environment.</v>

37
00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:09.880
<v Speaker 1>It's the sixth most spoken romance </v>
<v Speaker 1>language after Spanish,</v>

38
00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:11.200
<v Speaker 1>Portuguese,</v>
<v Speaker 1>French,</v>

39
00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:12.580
<v Speaker 1>Italian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Romanian.</v>

40
00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:16.270
<v Speaker 1>It's also the most spoken nonstate </v>
<v Speaker 1>language in Europe,</v>

41
00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.400
<v Speaker 1>meaning that it's the most spoken </v>
<v Speaker 1>language.</v>

42
00:02:18.401 --> 00:02:21.010
<v Speaker 1>That's not an official language at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>national level.</v>

43
00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:24.160
<v Speaker 1>That's because it's not official at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>national level in Spain,</v>

44
00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:27.730
<v Speaker 1>even though millions of people speak it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's only official in endora.</v>

45
00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:28.893
<v Speaker 1>Some people want it to be the official </v>
<v Speaker 1>language of a new country called </v>

46
00:02:31.361 --> 00:02:33.670
<v Speaker 1>Catalonia that would be separate from </v>
<v Speaker 1>Spain.</v>

47
00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:38.633
<v Speaker 1>Tell you what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can just google it and history like </v>

48
00:02:40.921 --> 00:02:41.754
<v Speaker 1>all romance languages.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Katelyn developed from dialects of </v>

49
00:02:44.191 --> 00:02:48.030
<v Speaker 1>vulgar Latin in areas that had been </v>
<v Speaker 1>under the control of the Roman Empire.</v>

50
00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:50.670
<v Speaker 1>The earliest form of oxytocin or </v>
<v Speaker 1>romance,</v>

51
00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:51.553
<v Speaker 1>no one has old oxy 10 or old provence </v>
<v Speaker 1>owl had developed by the eighth century </v>

52
00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:59.470
<v Speaker 1>and later some of its varieties began to</v>
<v Speaker 1>diverge into old Katelyn.</v>

53
00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:03.160
<v Speaker 1>Between the 10th and 14th centuries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In the 12th century,</v>

54
00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:05.000
<v Speaker 1>the county of Barcelona,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't,</v>

55
00:03:05.001 --> 00:03:08.620
<v Speaker 1>Deland County formed a dynastic union </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the Kingdom of Aragon,</v>

56
00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:13.680
<v Speaker 1>forming the crown of our goal and other </v>
<v Speaker 1>Catalan counties formed the Principality</v>

57
00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:17.020
<v Speaker 1>of Catalonia together with Barcelona,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bringing them into the crown.</v>

58
00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:20.800
<v Speaker 1>The crown of our gone expanded under the</v>
<v Speaker 1>rule of James the conqueror,</v>

59
00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:24.760
<v Speaker 1>who brought Valencia and the Balearic </v>
<v Speaker 1>islands under the crown's control,</v>

60
00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:25.683
<v Speaker 1>and these became Catalan speaking areas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The political capital of the crown of </v>

61
00:03:28.901 --> 00:03:32.560
<v Speaker 1>our goal was the city of Zaragoza in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kingdom of are gone,</v>

62
00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:33.573
<v Speaker 1>but the defacto economic and cultural </v>
<v Speaker 1>centers where Barcelona and Valencia </v>

63
00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:39.010
<v Speaker 1>both Kavalan speaking cities.</v>

64
00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:40.683
<v Speaker 1>By the 14th and 15th centuries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the crown of Aragona had greatly </v>

65
00:03:43.721 --> 00:03:46.300
<v Speaker 1>expanded to include Corsica,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sardinia,</v>

66
00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:47.650
<v Speaker 1>Sicily,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Naples.</v>

67
00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:50.500
<v Speaker 1>And for a brief time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Athens and Nail Patras.</v>

68
00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:54.160
<v Speaker 1>In present day Greece,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a large cancel land commercial</v>

69
00:03:54.161 --> 00:03:54.994
<v Speaker 1>presence throughout the Mediterranean </v>
<v Speaker 1>region and the Catalan language became </v>

70
00:03:57.971 --> 00:04:00.670
<v Speaker 1>widespread,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least amongst the commercial class.</v>

71
00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:03.580
<v Speaker 1>Catelynn was considered one of the great</v>
<v Speaker 1>languages of Europe.</v>

72
00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:04.623
<v Speaker 1>But in 1479 the crown of Aragon formed a</v>
<v Speaker 1>union with the crown of Casteel and </v>

73
00:04:09.071 --> 00:04:12.520
<v Speaker 1>Castilian today also known as just the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Spanish or espanol,</v>

74
00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:16.570
<v Speaker 1>began to grow in influence and cancel </v>
<v Speaker 1>and began to decline an influence.</v>

75
00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:20.890
<v Speaker 1>During much of the period from the 16th </v>
<v Speaker 1>century to the 20th century,</v>

76
00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:21.753
<v Speaker 1>various laws were enacted that limited </v>
<v Speaker 1>the use of cattle and in official </v>

77
00:04:24.881 --> 00:04:28.510
<v Speaker 1>documents and publications in </v>
<v Speaker 1>administration and in schools.</v>

78
00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:32.590
<v Speaker 1>But since 1975 it has been made co </v>
<v Speaker 1>official in Catalonia,</v>

79
00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:33.453
<v Speaker 1>Valencia and the belly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eric Islands and in Catalonia schools </v>

80
00:04:36.281 --> 00:04:39.160
<v Speaker 1>are now required to teach most subjects </v>
<v Speaker 1>in Catalan.</v>

81
00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:40.113
<v Speaker 1>In Valencia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's less instruction and catelynn </v>

82
00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:44.140
<v Speaker 1>known officially there as Valencian by </v>
<v Speaker 1>the way,</v>

83
00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:47.830
<v Speaker 1>but there are current government efforts</v>
<v Speaker 1>to increase it in the belly.</v>

84
00:04:47.831 --> 00:04:48.664
<v Speaker 1>Eric Islands,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least 50% of the students schooling </v>

85
00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:51.843
<v Speaker 1>must be conducted in Katelyn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Though there are also programs that are </v>

86
00:04:54.341 --> 00:04:55.174
<v Speaker 1>taught entirely in Katelyn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of the cattle land speaking </v>

87
00:04:57.431 --> 00:05:01.900
<v Speaker 1>autonomous areas of Spain or bilingual </v>
<v Speaker 1>with Catalan speakers also being Spanish</v>

88
00:05:01.901 --> 00:05:04.690
<v Speaker 1>speakers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what's Catalan like?</v>

89
00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:06.123
<v Speaker 1>Once you learn one romance language,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've already taken a great step </v>

90
00:05:08.771 --> 00:05:09.604
<v Speaker 1>towards understanding the others.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we look at a list of basic greetings </v>

91
00:05:12.761 --> 00:05:15.070
<v Speaker 1>and capsule,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then there will definitely be some words</v>

92
00:05:15.071 --> 00:05:18.520
<v Speaker 1>that speakers of other romance languages</v>
<v Speaker 1>will recognize immediately.</v>

93
00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:21.020
<v Speaker 1>Good morning or good day on the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Portuguese,</v>

95
00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:25.480
<v Speaker 1>Bom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dia and Spanish.</v>

97

98
00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:36.430
<v Speaker 1>Good evening or good night.</v>

99
00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:37.433

<v Speaker 1>night would be worn or not dare to say </v>

<v Speaker 1>to Portuguese.</v>

102
00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:51.603
<v Speaker 1>Are they all Spanish and French?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Add you and if you want to be more </v>

103
00:05:56.531 --> 00:06:01.531
<v Speaker 1>formal you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>compare that with French oak of Wa.</v>

104
00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:03.223
<v Speaker 1>Now let's look at some cattle and </v>
<v Speaker 1>sentences and examine some of the </v>

105
00:06:05.481 --> 00:06:07.160
<v Speaker 1>languages.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Basic features,</v>

106
00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:08.083
<v Speaker 1>many of which are quite similar to other</v>
<v Speaker 1>romance languages but with some </v>

107
00:06:10.701 --> 00:06:13.330
<v Speaker 1>differences of course of Zeb is in </v>
<v Speaker 1>bumper fussell.</v>

00:06:18.771 --> 00:06:23.771
<v Speaker 1>It's the Joseph is a good teacher.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This sentence follows basically the same</v>

111
00:06:24.291 --> 00:06:25.124
<v Speaker 1>word order you would find in other </v>
<v Speaker 1>romance languages and an English with </v>

112
00:06:27.801 --> 00:06:30.960
<v Speaker 1>one difference.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The definite article all before the name</v>

113
00:06:30.970 --> 00:06:31.803
<v Speaker 1>Joseph in Catalan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a definite article is used before </v>

114
00:06:34.401 --> 00:06:37.490
<v Speaker 1>people's first names and this is called </v>
<v Speaker 1>the personal article.</v>

115
00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:39.710
<v Speaker 1>We'll come back to definite articles in </v>
<v Speaker 1>a minute.</v>

116
00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:42.290
<v Speaker 1>This whole sentence is masculine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>singular,</v>

117
00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:44.840
<v Speaker 1>like other romance languages,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cantillon nouns,</v>

118
00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:47.690
<v Speaker 1>articles and adjectives are inflected </v>
<v Speaker 1>for grammatical,</v>

119
00:06:47.691 --> 00:06:48.524
<v Speaker 1>gender and number.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's look at a similar feminine </v>

120
00:06:50.421 --> 00:06:52.760
<v Speaker 1>sentence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Laser Velez and I want to prefer Sota.</v>

121
00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:56.720
<v Speaker 1>Isabel is a good teacher,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let of is and I want to prefer soda.</v>

122
00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:58.093
<v Speaker 1>Feminine nouns generally and in a and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the adjectives that modify them are </v>

123
00:07:01.491 --> 00:07:03.950
<v Speaker 1>inflected with a feminine ending a as </v>
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>

124
00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:08.120
<v Speaker 1>While masculine nouns generally end in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>consonant or an o or I.</v>

125
00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:10.093
<v Speaker 1>One other thing I want to point out here</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that the letter R is silent in the </v>

126
00:07:13.101 --> 00:07:17.060
<v Speaker 1>final position in Katelyn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so this word professoral ends in a vowel</v>

127
00:07:17.061 --> 00:07:17.894
<v Speaker 1>sound.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are basically four definite </v>

128
00:07:20.571 --> 00:07:23.570
<v Speaker 1>articles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The singular forms are all and la,</v>

129
00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:26.060
<v Speaker 1>which changed to look with an </v>
<v Speaker 1>apostrophe.</v>

130
00:07:26.090 --> 00:07:29.030
<v Speaker 1>If the following word starts with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>vowel or an h,</v>

131
00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:33.110
<v Speaker 1>the plural forms are us and less for the</v>
<v Speaker 1>personal article.</v>

132
00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:33.973
<v Speaker 1>There are the alternate forms and not </v>
<v Speaker 1>with an apostrophe before a vowel or an </v>

133
00:07:38.391 --> 00:07:39.224
<v Speaker 1>h.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The indefinite articles are we not </v>

134
00:07:42.170 --> 00:07:43.003
<v Speaker 1>wounds and Eunice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way articles work in Catelynn is </v>

135
00:07:45.831 --> 00:07:49.400
<v Speaker 1>similar to another romance languages,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the forms are different of course,</v>

136
00:07:49.580 --> 00:07:52.880
<v Speaker 1>and there are also some dialectal </v>
<v Speaker 1>differences in Catalan articles.</v>

137
00:07:53.750 --> 00:07:55.870
<v Speaker 1>Another sentence it yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and but of the animals.</v>

138
00:07:55.880 --> 00:07:56.713
<v Speaker 1>Dot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This means she always has lunch very </v>

139
00:07:58.581 --> 00:08:01.460
<v Speaker 1>late,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a simpler the animal dot word for word,</v>

140
00:08:01.461 --> 00:08:05.150
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she always has lunch very late.</v>

141
00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:06.193
<v Speaker 1>One thing I'd like to point out right </v>
<v Speaker 1>off the bat is this phrase molded in </v>

142
00:08:09.681 --> 00:08:11.450
<v Speaker 1>Spanish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would be week dot.</v>

143
00:08:11.451 --> 00:08:14.450
<v Speaker 1>A day in Portuguese it would be winter </v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible].</v>

144
00:08:14.570 --> 00:08:18.620
<v Speaker 1>In Italian it would be [inaudible] quite</v>
<v Speaker 1>similar to the candyland phrase,</v>

145
00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:22.040
<v Speaker 1>but in the other languages,</v>
<v Speaker 1>words tend to end in vowels,</v>

146
00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:22.933
<v Speaker 1>especially in Italian.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Words end in consonants much more often </v>

147
00:08:25.521 --> 00:08:26.354
<v Speaker 1>than Katelyn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also pay attention to the </v>

148
00:08:28.101 --> 00:08:28.730
<v Speaker 1>continents.</v>

149
00:08:28.730 --> 00:08:29.563
<v Speaker 1>At the end of these words.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here we see the simplification of final </v>

150
00:08:32.391 --> 00:08:33.224
<v Speaker 1>consonant clusters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>T is often not pronounced after another </v>

151
00:08:36.231 --> 00:08:40.670
<v Speaker 1>consonant at the end of a word,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially in the combinations of Lt,</v>

152
00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:43.010
<v Speaker 1>rt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nt and St.</v>

153
00:08:43.190 --> 00:08:44.023
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes it may be pronounced slightly </v>
<v Speaker 1>or articulated but not released and in </v>

154
00:08:48.141 --> 00:08:48.974
<v Speaker 1>final position,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the letter d is pronounced as to but </v>

155
00:08:51.921 --> 00:08:56.400
<v Speaker 1>similar to t it's often silent or </v>
<v Speaker 1>unreleased after another consonant.</v>

156
00:08:56.610 --> 00:08:57.443
<v Speaker 1>Simplification of final consonant </v>
<v Speaker 1>clusters is a prominent feature of </v>

157
00:09:00.391 --> 00:09:01.224
<v Speaker 1>Cadillac,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it does not always happen and it </v>

158
00:09:02.941 --> 00:09:03.774
<v Speaker 1>varies depending on the dialect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The speaker in the samples speaks a </v>

159
00:09:06.751 --> 00:09:07.584
<v Speaker 1>central Catalan dialect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here we have a personal pronoun as the </v>

160
00:09:11.281 --> 00:09:14.160
<v Speaker 1>subject of the sentence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is actually not necessary.</v>

161
00:09:14.190 --> 00:09:18.240
<v Speaker 1>Cantillon is a pro dropped language,</v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning that the subject pronouns can be</v>

162
00:09:18.241 --> 00:09:19.074
<v Speaker 1>dropped because person a number are </v>
<v Speaker 1>clear from the verb conjugation like </v>

163
00:09:22.801 --> 00:09:23.950
<v Speaker 1>other romance languages.</v>

164
00:09:23.970 --> 00:09:26.490
<v Speaker 1>Katelyn has two types of personal </v>
<v Speaker 1>pronouns,</v>

165
00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:27.353
<v Speaker 1>strong pronouns,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which are used as subject pronouns and </v>

166
00:09:29.791 --> 00:09:30.624
<v Speaker 1>after prepositions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The only difference being in the first </v>

167
00:09:32.581 --> 00:09:34.980
<v Speaker 1>person singular and there are weak </v>
<v Speaker 1>pronouns,</v>

168
00:09:35.070 --> 00:09:38.610
<v Speaker 1>which are clinics that are used for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>direct or indirect object.</v>

169
00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:42.780
<v Speaker 1>Cattle then has more weak pronoun forums</v>
<v Speaker 1>than other major romance languages.</v>

170
00:09:43.860 --> 00:09:44.693
<v Speaker 1>Just a note about this word [inaudible] </v>
<v Speaker 1>in this sentence it's pronounced as the </v>

171
00:09:47.791 --> 00:09:51.120
<v Speaker 1>na because in Catalan d is pronounced as</v>
<v Speaker 1>the soft,</v>

172
00:09:51.180 --> 00:09:52.013
<v Speaker 1>the sound between vowels.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even though the D is in the initial </v>

173
00:09:54.811 --> 00:09:55.644
<v Speaker 1>position here it is affected by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>vowel at the end of the previous word </v>

174
00:09:59.990 --> 00:10:00.823
<v Speaker 1>did not is irregular verb meaning to </v>
<v Speaker 1>have lunch and here it's conjugated in </v>

175
00:10:04.261 --> 00:10:06.660
<v Speaker 1>the third person singular for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>present tense.</v>

176
00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:08.073
<v Speaker 1>Katelyn has three categories of regular </v>
<v Speaker 1>verbs which are characterized by </v>

177
00:10:11.131 --> 00:10:13.680
<v Speaker 1>different endings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Verb ending in Ar,</v>

178
00:10:13.770 --> 00:10:18.120
<v Speaker 1>also known as the first conjugation verb</v>
<v Speaker 1>ending in our e or er,</v>

179
00:10:18.180 --> 00:10:21.150
<v Speaker 1>the second conjugation and verbs ending </v>
<v Speaker 1>in irr.</v>

180
00:10:21.210 --> 00:10:22.043
<v Speaker 1>The third conjugation verbs in each </v>
<v Speaker 1>category have the same or similar </v>

181
00:10:25.321 --> 00:10:28.020
<v Speaker 1>conjugations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Another sentence,</v>

182
00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:32.040
<v Speaker 1>mother nothin's [inaudible] this means </v>
<v Speaker 1>he gave me the money this morning,</v>

183
00:10:32.310 --> 00:10:33.143
<v Speaker 1>mother,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not those dienes I couldn't Mati word </v>

184
00:10:34.681 --> 00:10:35.514
<v Speaker 1>for word.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's to me has given the masculine </v>

185
00:10:38.041 --> 00:10:42.510
<v Speaker 1>plural money this morning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first word ma is a week Pronoun,</v>

186
00:10:42.540 --> 00:10:44.730
<v Speaker 1>which is used for the indirect object </v>
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>

187
00:10:45.030 --> 00:10:45.863
<v Speaker 1>This form of the Pronoun m apostrophe </v>
<v Speaker 1>comes before vowels and the letter h </v>

188
00:10:49.590 --> 00:10:52.650
<v Speaker 1>while before consonants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's m as in m.</v>

189
00:10:53.070 --> 00:10:53.903
<v Speaker 1>Notice that it comes before the verb.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Other not is the perfect form of the </v>

190
00:10:56.941 --> 00:11:01.941
<v Speaker 1>verb do na the perfect form includes the</v>
<v Speaker 1>auxiliary verb of a followed by the past</v>

191
00:11:02.101 --> 00:11:02.934
<v Speaker 1>participle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's used for events in the recent past </v>

192
00:11:05.580 --> 00:11:10.230
<v Speaker 1>and events within timeframes that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>connected to now like this month or this</v>

193
00:11:10.230 --> 00:11:11.063
<v Speaker 1>year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are parallel tenses in other </v>

194
00:11:12.031 --> 00:11:12.864
<v Speaker 1>romance languages and cattle and system </v>
<v Speaker 1>of verb tenses in general is very </v>

195
00:11:16.051 --> 00:11:17.790
<v Speaker 1>similar to other romance languages.</v>

196
00:11:18.420 --> 00:11:19.253
<v Speaker 1>Do not is another example of a Catalan </v>
<v Speaker 1>word ending in a continent where it </v>

197
00:11:22.801 --> 00:11:25.170
<v Speaker 1>would end with a vowel in other romance </v>
<v Speaker 1>languages.</v>

198
00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:26.093
<v Speaker 1>In Italian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this would be a little bottle and in </v>

199
00:11:27.551 --> 00:11:30.210
<v Speaker 1>Spanish it would be the model in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Romanian,</v>

200
00:11:30.211 --> 00:11:32.460
<v Speaker 1>however it would be donut.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Next,</v>

201
00:11:32.490 --> 00:11:36.270
<v Speaker 1>notice the masculine plural definite </v>
<v Speaker 1>article because the word for money,</v>

202
00:11:36.330 --> 00:11:37.163
<v Speaker 1>dns is plural.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The word a kid is similar to Italian </v>

203
00:11:41.371 --> 00:11:42.204
<v Speaker 1>Cuesta or Spanish and Portuguese Esta,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but notice that the s and t are </v>

204
00:11:45.931 --> 00:11:46.764
<v Speaker 1>pronounced differently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The S is silent in the tea is not </v>

205
00:11:49.201 --> 00:11:50.034
<v Speaker 1>released.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mati is similar to Italian Martina or </v>

206
00:11:53.020 --> 00:11:53.853
<v Speaker 1>French natal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Coming back to the week pronouns for a </v>

207
00:11:56.471 --> 00:11:57.304
<v Speaker 1>minute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What if we want to use a pronoun in </v>

208
00:11:58.781 --> 00:11:59.614
<v Speaker 1>place of [inaudible]?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whether or not that can mati the direct </v>

209
00:12:02.981 --> 00:12:04.720
<v Speaker 1>object in this case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

210
00:12:04.750 --> 00:12:08.680
<v Speaker 1>meaning it must come after the indirect </v>
<v Speaker 1>object week.</v>

211
00:12:08.681 --> 00:12:10.210
<v Speaker 1>Pronouns come after the verb.</v>

212
00:12:10.210 --> 00:12:13.450
<v Speaker 1>In the case of imperatives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least positive imperatives,</v>

213
00:12:13.540 --> 00:12:17.350
<v Speaker 1>jurrens and infinitives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the imperative sentence give it to me</v>

214
00:12:17.410 --> 00:12:22.080
<v Speaker 1>would be gona move another sentence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is about going to the AFI.</v>

215
00:12:22.100 --> 00:12:25.330
<v Speaker 1>Those ans this means he graduated two </v>
<v Speaker 1>years ago.</v>

216
00:12:25.540 --> 00:12:27.580
<v Speaker 1>Word for word.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's reflexive Pronoun.</v>

217
00:12:27.700 --> 00:12:30.430
<v Speaker 1>He graduated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>makes two years.</v>

218
00:12:30.580 --> 00:12:34.030
<v Speaker 1>Remember that the subject Pronoun l is </v>
<v Speaker 1>probably not necessary.</v>

219
00:12:34.300 --> 00:12:36.430
<v Speaker 1>Let's look at the end of the sentence </v>
<v Speaker 1>first.</v>

220
00:12:36.550 --> 00:12:37.383
<v Speaker 1>This phrase here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Father's ons shows the use of the verb </v>

221
00:12:39.880 --> 00:12:44.290
<v Speaker 1>fe meaning to make to tell how much time</v>
<v Speaker 1>has passed since then event happened.</v>

222
00:12:44.470 --> 00:12:46.990
<v Speaker 1>This is similar to how it would be </v>
<v Speaker 1>expressed in Italian.</v>

223
00:12:47.080 --> 00:12:52.080
<v Speaker 1>Do a on the far as about a lot of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>work is a past tense construction called</v>

224
00:12:52.361 --> 00:12:55.240
<v Speaker 1>the pair of rustic past that is unique </v>
<v Speaker 1>to Katelyn.</v>

225
00:12:55.360 --> 00:12:56.193
<v Speaker 1>It consists of an auxiliary verb related</v>
<v Speaker 1>to but not identical to the present </v>

226
00:12:59.921 --> 00:13:00.880
<v Speaker 1>tense of the verb.</v>

227
00:13:00.950 --> 00:13:04.300
<v Speaker 1>ONA meaning to go followed by a verb in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the infinitive.</v>

228
00:13:04.630 --> 00:13:05.463
<v Speaker 1>The pair of frantic past is identical </v>
<v Speaker 1>and meaning to the simple past which is </v>

229
00:13:08.471 --> 00:13:09.304
<v Speaker 1>now normally limited to literary use.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Note that the reflexive pronoun in a </v>

230
00:13:13.271 --> 00:13:14.104
<v Speaker 1>different form can appear after the verb</v>
<v Speaker 1>instead if it's an infinitive or an </v>

231
00:13:17.471 --> 00:13:18.304
<v Speaker 1>imperative or general.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this could also be boggled of the </v>

232
00:13:20.920 --> 00:13:24.290
<v Speaker 1>water sup and the whole sentence could </v>
<v Speaker 1>be a bug.</v>

233
00:13:24.291 --> 00:13:25.124
<v Speaker 1>A lot of the water [inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 1>This verb construction is somewhat </v>

234
00:13:27.791 --> 00:13:31.810
<v Speaker 1>surprising to me because it looks quite </v>
<v Speaker 1>similar to the paraphrase stick future.</v>

235
00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:32.673
<v Speaker 1>Using anon out of the waterside means he</v>
<v Speaker 1>is going to graduate with va being the </v>

236
00:13:37.511 --> 00:13:40.210
<v Speaker 1>third person singular present tense of </v>
<v Speaker 1>ONA.</v>

237
00:13:40.930 --> 00:13:43.960
<v Speaker 1>This [inaudible] future form is used </v>
<v Speaker 1>lefts and Katelyn.</v>

238
00:13:43.990 --> 00:13:44.823
<v Speaker 1>Then in some other romance languages </v>
<v Speaker 1>probably because it resembles the pair </v>

239
00:13:47.551 --> 00:13:51.550
<v Speaker 1>of frantic past.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So instead the simple future can be used</v>

240
00:13:51.880 --> 00:13:52.720
<v Speaker 1>as a good of the water.</v>

241
00:13:52.900 --> 00:13:53.733
<v Speaker 1>He will graduate in Catalan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You typically formed the simple future </v>

242
00:13:56.981 --> 00:13:59.740
<v Speaker 1>tense by adding a suffix to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>infinitive form,</v>

243
00:13:59.860 --> 00:14:02.740
<v Speaker 1>but for some irregular verbs there is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>different future stem,</v>

244
00:14:02.770 --> 00:14:05.290
<v Speaker 1>not the infinitive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In general,</v>

245
00:14:05.320 --> 00:14:06.153
<v Speaker 1>the way the cattle and verbs are </v>
<v Speaker 1>conjugated is quite similar to other </v>

246
00:14:08.561 --> 00:14:09.394
<v Speaker 1>romance languages except that the exact </v>
<v Speaker 1>forms are somewhat different with </v>

247
00:14:12.791 --> 00:14:13.624
<v Speaker 1>Western romance languages in general.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you speak one or if you've studied </v>

248
00:14:16.661 --> 00:14:17.494
<v Speaker 1>one than the other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>seems somewhat familiar right off the </v>

249
00:14:19.271 --> 00:14:20.890
<v Speaker 1>bat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but on the other hand,</v>

250
00:14:20.950 --> 00:14:23.080
<v Speaker 1>everything seems somewhat different as </v>
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>

251
00:14:23.110 --> 00:14:25.810
<v Speaker 1>There's some different vocabulary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>different phonology,</v>

252
00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:26.673
<v Speaker 1>some different grammatical features and </v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes things are just expressed </v>

253
00:14:29.261 --> 00:14:32.220
<v Speaker 1>differently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Being previously unfamiliar with Katelyn</v>

254
00:14:32.230 --> 00:14:33.063
<v Speaker 1>for the most part,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what strikes me is that I noticed </v>

255
00:14:34.781 --> 00:14:37.360
<v Speaker 1>features that are similar to Spanish to </v>
<v Speaker 1>French,</v>

256
00:14:37.390 --> 00:14:39.850
<v Speaker 1>to Italian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to Portuguese into Romanian,</v>

257
00:14:40.090 --> 00:14:40.923
<v Speaker 1>but I would never confuse it with one of</v>
<v Speaker 1>those languages because it has its own </v>

258
00:14:43.601 --> 00:14:45.130
<v Speaker 1>unique elements as well.</v>

259
00:14:45.190 --> 00:14:47.830
<v Speaker 1>The question of the day for speakers of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Katelyn,</v>

260
00:14:48.040 --> 00:14:51.220
<v Speaker 1>what other romance languages do you find</v>
<v Speaker 1>closest to Katelyn?</v>

261
00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:54.980
<v Speaker 1>Can you communicate with Occitan </v>
<v Speaker 1>speakers easily or Italian speakers,</v>

262
00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:55.833
<v Speaker 1>et Cetera,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and for speakers of other romance </v>

263
00:14:57.501 --> 00:15:00.290
<v Speaker 1>languages?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How familiar does Catalan seem to you?</v>

264
00:15:00.470 --> 00:15:01.303
<v Speaker 1>What differences stand out to you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Special thanks to my friend Pablo who </v>
