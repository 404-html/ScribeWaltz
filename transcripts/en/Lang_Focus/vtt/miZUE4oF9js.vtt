<v Speaker 1>Today I think I'll compare Portuguese </v>
<v Speaker 1>with a special dialect of Portuguese </v>

2
00:00:05.551 --> 00:00:06.690
<v Speaker 1>called Spanish.</v>

3
00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:15.613
<v Speaker 1>Hello everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Welcome to the Lange Focus Channel and </v>

4
00:00:17.421 --> 00:00:18.254
<v Speaker 1>my name is Paul.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Today's topic is how similar or Spanish </v>

5
00:00:21.111 --> 00:00:23.390
<v Speaker 1>and Portuguese,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as you probably know,</v>

6
00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:24.253
<v Speaker 1>Spanish and Portuguese are both Ibero </v>
<v Speaker 1>Romance languages that share a common </v>

7
00:00:27.831 --> 00:00:30.260
<v Speaker 1>origin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are different enough that they are</v>

8
00:00:30.261 --> 00:00:32.330
<v Speaker 1>definitely considered different </v>
<v Speaker 1>languages,</v>

9
00:00:32.331 --> 00:00:35.930
<v Speaker 1>but they're also closely related and </v>
<v Speaker 1>quite similar in many ways.</v>

10
00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:37.033
<v Speaker 1>On paper,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the two languages look very similar and </v>

11
00:00:38.841 --> 00:00:39.674
<v Speaker 1>speakers of either language can </v>
<v Speaker 1>generally read the other language </v>

12
00:00:42.201 --> 00:00:45.140
<v Speaker 1>without too much trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The spoken language is however,</v>

13
00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:46.033
<v Speaker 1>are more different from each other and </v>
<v Speaker 1>less mutually intelligible than the </v>

14
00:00:48.801 --> 00:00:49.634
<v Speaker 1>written forms and Portuguese speakers </v>
<v Speaker 1>typically understand spoken Spanish </v>

15
00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:54.313
<v Speaker 1>better than Spanish speakers understand </v>
<v Speaker 1>Portuguese because Portuguese speakers </v>

16
00:00:57.861 --> 00:01:00.320
<v Speaker 1>as smart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well actually it's mostly because of the</v>

17
00:01:00.321 --> 00:01:02.810
<v Speaker 1>difference in pronunciation between the </v>
<v Speaker 1>two languages,</v>

18
00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:03.673
<v Speaker 1>but we'll get into that a little later.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Spanish and Portuguese share about 89 </v>

19
00:01:06.951 --> 00:01:07.784
<v Speaker 1>percent lexical similarity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning that 89 percent of the words </v>

20
00:01:10.881 --> 00:01:13.790
<v Speaker 1>have a cognate or an equivalent in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>other language.</v>

21
00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:16.310
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't always mean that 89 percent</v>

22
00:01:16.311 --> 00:01:17.144
<v Speaker 1>of the words will be the same because </v>
<v Speaker 1>some of the different words are very </v>

23
00:01:19.881 --> 00:01:23.630
<v Speaker 1>basic and common words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and even though cognate words often look</v>

24
00:01:23.631 --> 00:01:24.464
<v Speaker 1>and sound quite similar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are other cognates that have </v>

25
00:01:26.241 --> 00:01:29.390
<v Speaker 1>developed quite differently and now </v>
<v Speaker 1>sound and look quite different.</v>

26
00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:30.343
<v Speaker 1>For instance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this pair of cognates clearly resemble </v>

27
00:01:32.271 --> 00:01:35.600
<v Speaker 1>each other in Spanish and in Portuguese.</v>
