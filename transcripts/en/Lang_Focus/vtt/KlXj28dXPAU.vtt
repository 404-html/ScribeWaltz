00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:07.113
<v Speaker 1>Hello everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Welcome to the Lange Focus Channel and </v>

4
00:00:08.891 --> 00:00:12.190
<v Speaker 1>my name is Paul.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Today's topic is a language that some of</v>

5
00:00:12.191 --> 00:00:13.024
<v Speaker 1>you have probably never heard of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's a fascinating topic and one </v>

6
00:00:15.491 --> 00:00:19.570
<v Speaker 1>that's definitely worth a look.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The topic is catch you up and then catch</v>

7
00:00:19.571 --> 00:00:21.880
<v Speaker 1>you up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The language is sometimes referred to as</v>

8
00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.760
<v Speaker 1>Luna see me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which means the people's language.</v>

9
00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:27.090
<v Speaker 1>If we include all varieties of catch you</v>
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>

10
00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:27.963
<v Speaker 1>It is by far the most widely spoken </v>
<v Speaker 1>native language in South America with </v>

11
00:00:31.151 --> 00:00:34.480
<v Speaker 1>between eight and 10 million speakers </v>
<v Speaker 1>spread out across Peru,</v>

12
00:00:34.481 --> 00:00:35.314
<v Speaker 1>Bolivia and Ecuador,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as well as northern Argentina and </v>

13
00:00:37.751 --> 00:00:41.020
<v Speaker 1>southern Columbia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Spanish is now the dominant language and</v>

14
00:00:41.021 --> 00:00:41.854
<v Speaker 1>all of those countries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but of course that wasn't always the </v>

15
00:00:43.631 --> 00:00:45.940
<v Speaker 1>case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even if you haven't heard of Catchoua,</v>

16
00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:46.803
<v Speaker 1>you've most definitely heard of the Inca</v>
<v Speaker 1>civilization whose capital was located </v>

17
00:00:50.201 --> 00:00:51.034
<v Speaker 1>at Cusco in present day Peru and who's </v>
<v Speaker 1>empire was the largest in the Americas </v>

18
00:00:54.761 --> 00:00:55.594
<v Speaker 1>in the pre colonial period,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and as their empire expanded the </v>

19
00:00:58.151 --> 00:00:58.984
<v Speaker 1>language spread to new areas because it </v>
<v Speaker 1>became the general language or the </v>

20
00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:05.410
<v Speaker 1>Lingua Franca of the areas under the </v>
<v Speaker 1>empire's control,</v>

21
00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:06.303
<v Speaker 1>the origin of catch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is debated with some people saying </v>

22
00:01:08.351 --> 00:01:09.184
<v Speaker 1>that it originated in the Cusco area and</v>
<v Speaker 1>others saying that it originated in the </v>

23
00:01:12.371 --> 00:01:14.260
<v Speaker 1>central coastal area of Peru.</v>

24
00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:17.950
<v Speaker 1>Throughout the time of Inca rule.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Catch well was not a written language.</v>

25
00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:22.420
<v Speaker 1>Records were only kept in kibbutz.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A system of nodded strings that serve as</v>

26
00:01:22.421 --> 00:01:23.254
<v Speaker 1>symbols or mnemonic reminders of </v>
<v Speaker 1>information keepers are not fully </v>

27
00:01:26.591 --> 00:01:27.424
<v Speaker 1>understood,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they are not thought to represent </v>

28
00:01:29.141 --> 00:01:31.240
<v Speaker 1>the sound or the structure of catch you </v>
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>

29
00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:32.283
<v Speaker 1>Instead,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they simply provide reminders of </v>

30
00:01:33.611 --> 00:01:34.444
<v Speaker 1>information to be passed down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>orally catch what did not become a </v>

31
00:01:37.271 --> 00:01:40.570
<v Speaker 1>written language until the Spanish </v>
<v Speaker 1>conquest of the Inca empire,</v>

32
00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:41.493
<v Speaker 1>which took place between 1532 and 15 </v>
<v Speaker 1>slash 70 to catch what continued to be </v>

33
00:01:45.581 --> 00:01:46.414
<v Speaker 1>spoken as a Lingua Franca.</v>
<v Speaker 1>After the Spanish conquest and the </v>

34
00:01:49.151 --> 00:01:49.984
<v Speaker 1>Catholic church used to catch why in its</v>
<v Speaker 1>efforts to convert people spreading the </v>

35
00:01:53.081 --> 00:01:53.914
<v Speaker 1>language even further.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The oldest written record of catch you </v>

36
00:01:56.031 --> 00:01:56.864
<v Speaker 1>up is a book written in 15,</v>
<v Speaker 1>60 by the missionary Domingo de Santo </v>

37
00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:01.473
<v Speaker 1>Tomas called Grammar or art of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>general language of the Indians of the </v>

38
00:02:04.451 --> 00:02:05.680
<v Speaker 1>royalty of Peru.</v>

39
00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:07.173
<v Speaker 1>After the Tupac Amaru rebellion of 1780,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the colonial power band catch you up </v>

40
00:02:11.231 --> 00:02:12.064
<v Speaker 1>from public use even catch what texts </v>
<v Speaker 1>that were pro colonial or pro Catholic </v>

41
00:02:15.791 --> 00:02:16.624
<v Speaker 1>were banned and the language began to </v>
<v Speaker 1>decline after the Spanish American wars </v>

42
00:02:19.961 --> 00:02:21.520
<v Speaker 1>of independence from Eighteen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

43
00:02:21.521 --> 00:02:25.150
<v Speaker 1>eight to 18,</v>
<v Speaker 1>33 gets you ahead a brief revival,</v>

44
00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:28.210
<v Speaker 1>but it has gradually lost prestige and </v>
<v Speaker 1>declined in use.</v>

45
00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:32.170
<v Speaker 1>One of the main reasons for the decline </v>
<v Speaker 1>of catch you up is the use of Spanish as</v>

46
00:02:32.171 --> 00:02:36.040
<v Speaker 1>the language of education and of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>media and the use of Spanish as the main</v>

47
00:02:36.041 --> 00:02:36.874
<v Speaker 1>language of national economies and with </v>
<v Speaker 1>economic development comes increased </v>

48
00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:41.313
<v Speaker 1>urbanization.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When people move from their local area </v>

49
00:02:43.241 --> 00:02:46.390
<v Speaker 1>to a major city,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's necessary to speak Spanish with the</v>

50
00:02:46.391 --> 00:02:48.660
<v Speaker 1>majority of people who don't speak catch</v>
<v Speaker 1>you up.</v>

51
00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:49.743
<v Speaker 1>Spanish is often thought of as the </v>
<v Speaker 1>language of prestige and of economic </v>

52
00:02:52.631 --> 00:02:53.464
<v Speaker 1>opportunity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so speakers of catch you up or people </v>

53
00:02:55.121 --> 00:02:55.954
<v Speaker 1>whose parents speak catch you up often </v>
<v Speaker 1>see it as something low prestige and to </v>

54
00:02:59.441 --> 00:03:02.710
<v Speaker 1>avoid some ketchup speaking parents,</v>
<v Speaker 1>avoid speaking,</v>

55
00:03:02.711 --> 00:03:06.040
<v Speaker 1>catch you up with their children at home</v>
<v Speaker 1>and instead speak to them in Spanish.</v>

56
00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:10.010
<v Speaker 1>Even in researching this video and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>looking for volunteers to read the catch</v>

57
00:03:10.011 --> 00:03:12.790
<v Speaker 1>with samples,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some people told me that they themselves</v>

58
00:03:12.791 --> 00:03:13.750
<v Speaker 1>don't speak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>catch you up,</v>

59
00:03:13.751 --> 00:03:17.520
<v Speaker 1>but that their friend's parents speak </v>
<v Speaker 1>Quechua or that their uncle or aunt's be</v>

60
00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:19.293
<v Speaker 1>Peru was the first country to make catch</v>
<v Speaker 1>you on official language in 1975 along </v>

61
00:03:23.261 --> 00:03:26.620
<v Speaker 1>with Imr and other native languages in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Bolivia.</v>

62
00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:27.483
<v Speaker 1>It's been an official language along </v>
<v Speaker 1>with 35 other native languages since </v>

63
00:03:30.461 --> 00:03:31.294
<v Speaker 1>2006 in Bolivia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Each regional government is officially </v>

64
00:03:34.451 --> 00:03:35.284
<v Speaker 1>bilingual,</v>
<v Speaker 1>choosing both Spanish and one of the </v>

65
00:03:37.121 --> 00:03:41.920
<v Speaker 1>other official languages in Ecuador.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Catch has had semi official status since</v>

66
00:03:41.921 --> 00:03:44.950
<v Speaker 1>2009.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Spanish is the main official language,</v>

67
00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:45.813
<v Speaker 1>but catch one shoe are referred to as </v>
<v Speaker 1>official languages for intercultural </v>

68
00:03:49.421 --> 00:03:54.070
<v Speaker 1>relations even though catch what began </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be written after the Spanish conquest</v>

69
00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:54.923
<v Speaker 1>is still mainly a spoken language and it</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't really written all that much and </v>

70
00:03:58.271 --> 00:04:00.790
<v Speaker 1>there are various different standards of</v>
<v Speaker 1>orthography.</v>

71
00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:04.360
<v Speaker 1>This is partly because catch was spoken </v>
<v Speaker 1>differently in different places.</v>

72
00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:09.300
<v Speaker 1>Catch what is not really a single </v>
<v Speaker 1>language.</v>

73
00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:13.830
<v Speaker 1>Rather it is a series of closely related</v>
<v Speaker 1>groups of dialects and those groups have</v>

74
00:04:13.831 --> 00:04:16.740
<v Speaker 1>dialects that have a high level of </v>
<v Speaker 1>mutual intelligibility,</v>

75
00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:17.603
<v Speaker 1>can be considered languages.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If there were one standard written </v>

76
00:04:20.341 --> 00:04:24.000
<v Speaker 1>language that was widely accepted and </v>
<v Speaker 1>widely used throughout all the different</v>

77
00:04:24.001 --> 00:04:24.834
<v Speaker 1>areas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then it might be able to be called a </v>

78
00:04:25.981 --> 00:04:28.530
<v Speaker 1>single language because of that unifying</v>
<v Speaker 1>force,</v>

79
00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:29.393
<v Speaker 1>but there is no such standard language </v>
<v Speaker 1>catch what is divided into two major </v>

80
00:04:32.761 --> 00:04:33.594
<v Speaker 1>dialect categories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Catch will one and catch what to which </v>

81
00:04:36.331 --> 00:04:37.164
<v Speaker 1>are fairly distinct from each other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's a dialect continuum within </v>

82
00:04:40.111 --> 00:04:42.030
<v Speaker 1>each category.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Catch well.</v>

83
00:04:42.031 --> 00:04:46.350
<v Speaker 1>One is spoken in central Peru and to </v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes referred to as whitewash.</v>

84
00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:47.353
<v Speaker 1>Catch what too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is sometimes called [inaudible] </v>

85
00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:52.530
<v Speaker 1>can be further subdivided into three </v>
<v Speaker 1>dialect groups.</v>

86
00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:53.693
<v Speaker 1>There's [inaudible] in northern Peru.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Catch what to be northern catch well </v>

87
00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:58.433
<v Speaker 1>also known as kitchen which has spoken </v>
<v Speaker 1>mainly in Ecuador and southern Columbia </v>

88
00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:04.860
<v Speaker 1>and catch what to see southern catch you</v>
<v Speaker 1>up,</v>

89
00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:05.753
<v Speaker 1>which includes the catch was spoken </v>
<v Speaker 1>around Cusco in Bolivia and in </v>

90
00:05:08.581 --> 00:05:09.330
<v Speaker 1>Argentina.</v>

91
00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:10.163
<v Speaker 1>Southern catch well is the most commonly</v>
<v Speaker 1>spoken and the Cusco dialect is often </v>

92
00:05:13.561 --> 00:05:16.230
<v Speaker 1>seen as the de facto standard variety of</v>
<v Speaker 1>catch.</v>

93
00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:17.820
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though it really isn't,</v>

94
00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:18.803
<v Speaker 1>the dialects within each of these groups</v>
<v Speaker 1>are largely intelligible and there is </v>

95
00:05:21.811 --> 00:05:24.690
<v Speaker 1>some degree of intelligibility between </v>
<v Speaker 1>the different groups.</v>

96
00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:25.913
<v Speaker 1>The lowest degree of intelligibility is </v>
<v Speaker 1>between casual one and catch what to </v>

97
00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:31.620
<v Speaker 1>even if both varieties are located in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Peru.</v>

98
00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:32.633
<v Speaker 1>The difference between a one and catch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What [inaudible] seems to have resulted </v>

99
00:05:35.281 --> 00:05:36.114
<v Speaker 1>from a split from catch will the main </v>
<v Speaker 1>differences between them or in </v>

100
00:05:39.091 --> 00:05:39.924
<v Speaker 1>vocabulary and morphology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are differences in pronunciation </v>

101
00:05:42.781 --> 00:05:43.614
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there are also pronunciation </v>

102
00:05:44.731 --> 00:05:48.380
<v Speaker 1>differences within each group.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what is catch like?</v>

103
00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:51.920
<v Speaker 1>Let's look at some of the features of </v>
<v Speaker 1>catch you up focusing on southern catch.</v>

104
00:05:51.921 --> 00:05:52.754
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>syntax catch while isn't Sov language </v>

105
00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:56.580
<v Speaker 1>subject,</v>
<v Speaker 1>object,</v>

106
00:05:56.581 --> 00:05:57.414
<v Speaker 1>verb.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's take a look at an example </v>

107
00:05:59.091 --> 00:05:59.924
<v Speaker 1>sentence.</v>

108
00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.880
<v Speaker 1>This means Maria builds a house word for</v>
<v Speaker 1>word.</v>

109
00:06:04.881 --> 00:06:08.620
<v Speaker 1>It's Maria House object marker,</v>
<v Speaker 1>build,</v>

110
00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:09.493
<v Speaker 1>third person singular.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can see that the basic order is </v>

111
00:06:11.391 --> 00:06:12.560
<v Speaker 1>subject,</v>
<v Speaker 1>object,</v>

112
00:06:12.561 --> 00:06:13.394
<v Speaker 1>verb.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The subject comes at the beginning of </v>

113
00:06:14.781 --> 00:06:16.880
<v Speaker 1>the sentence when there's an explicit </v>
<v Speaker 1>subject,</v>

114
00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:17.893
<v Speaker 1>but it's possible to have a complete </v>
<v Speaker 1>sentence without the subject at the </v>

115
00:06:20.211 --> 00:06:21.500
<v Speaker 1>beginning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like lassie,</v>

116
