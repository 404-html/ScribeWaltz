1
00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:00.983
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'm looking at the pimsleur website </v>

2
00:00:02.221 --> 00:00:03.020
<v Speaker 1>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

3
00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:05.430
<v Speaker 1>this is the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is the page for pimsleur French,</v>

4
00:00:05.431 --> 00:00:07.380
<v Speaker 1>and this looks really good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I'm going to buy this.</v>

5
00:00:07.381 --> 00:00:08.730
<v Speaker 1>So let's check the price.</v>

6
00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:10.963
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

7
00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:12.120
<v Speaker 1>what's that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

8
00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:15.830
<v Speaker 1>here's the price in pesos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wonder how much it is in dollars.</v>

9
00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:17.083
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

10
00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:19.550
<v Speaker 1>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's dollars.</v>

11
00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:29.260
<v Speaker 1>Hello folks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is Paul.</v>

12
00:00:29.261 --> 00:00:30.094
<v Speaker 1>How you doing today?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've decided to make this video to give </v>

13
00:00:32.621 --> 00:00:36.340
<v Speaker 1>you a review about a language program </v>
<v Speaker 1>called pimsleur.</v>

14
00:00:36.341 --> 00:00:38.830
<v Speaker 1>Pimsleur.</v>
<v Speaker 1>French is the one I wanted to focus on.</v>

15
00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:42.440
<v Speaker 1>I've done some other pimsleur courses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've done the,</v>

16
00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.190
<v Speaker 1>I did one level of Arabic right now I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>using tagalog.</v>

17
00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:48.310
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did one level of Hebrew wants,</v>

18
00:00:48.311 --> 00:00:50.540
<v Speaker 1>but the one that I've gone through the </v>
<v Speaker 1>most is French.</v>

19
00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:54.640
<v Speaker 1>I've did four levels of French.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are five levels now that I've done</v>

20
00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:56.950
<v Speaker 1>four of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I thought I'm in the best position to</v>

21
00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:59.080
<v Speaker 1>keep that one in mind and focus on that </v>
<v Speaker 1>one.</v>

22
00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:00.520
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so pimsleur,</v>

23
00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:03.220
<v Speaker 1>right there are five levels.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's quite good.</v>

24
00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:04.183
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like it but I think it's quite </v>

25
00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:10.540
<v Speaker 1>expensive and that seems to be one of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the common complaints is just the price,</v>

26
00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:13.390
<v Speaker 1>like it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a good quality program to learn the</v>

27
00:01:13.391 --> 00:01:16.060
<v Speaker 1>basic skills of a language,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's just really expensive.</v>

28
00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:17.623
<v Speaker 1>So if you buy a cds like levels one to </v>
<v Speaker 1>five would be like 150 cds because </v>

29
00:01:22.601 --> 00:01:25.990
<v Speaker 1>there's 30 CCS per level.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you bought them all on cd,</v>

30
00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:29.890
<v Speaker 1>that would be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think about $1,200</v>

31
00:01:29.891 --> 00:01:32.200
<v Speaker 1>us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So quite a lot of money,</v>

32
00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:33.093
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can get them in digital format and </v>

33
00:01:35.351 --> 00:01:38.980
<v Speaker 1>MP for about $550,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe it was the price.</v>

34
00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:41.650
<v Speaker 1>So less than half price for digital </v>
<v Speaker 1>format.</v>

35
00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:46.120
<v Speaker 1>So you can get that discount and I don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>recommend buying the CDS.</v>

36
00:01:46.121 --> 00:01:46.954
<v Speaker 1>Why would you buy the cds in 2015 when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can just get the MP three downloads </v>

37
00:01:51.041 --> 00:01:53.170
<v Speaker 1>for less than half the price.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'll do that.</v>

38
00:01:53.171 --> 00:01:56.410
<v Speaker 1>Or if you're a friend or someone happens</v>
<v Speaker 1>to have the cds,</v>

39
00:01:56.411 --> 00:01:59.920
<v Speaker 1>maybe you can borrow them if you feel </v>
<v Speaker 1>ethically okay with that.</v>

40
00:01:59.921 --> 00:02:03.850
<v Speaker 1>And if you're not worried about Simon </v>
<v Speaker 1>and Schuster coming to hunt you down and</v>

41
00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:05.110
<v Speaker 1>borrow them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

42
00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:07.720
<v Speaker 1>find a way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's good,</v>

43
00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:08.560
<v Speaker 1>but it's expensive.</v>

44
00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:10.720
<v Speaker 1>That's kind of the main thing I wanted </v>
<v Speaker 1>to start with.</v>

45
00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:11.823
<v Speaker 1>But let's talk about what's good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll give you my kind of sandwich </v>

46
00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:15.633
<v Speaker 1>format.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll give you the good than the </v>

47
00:02:16.691 --> 00:02:17.524
<v Speaker 1>imperfect and then kind of wind up with </v>
<v Speaker 1>the good and maybe a suggestion on how </v>

48
00:02:20.321 --> 00:02:21.730
<v Speaker 1>to use it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

49
00:02:21.731 --> 00:02:23.050
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the good things first,</v>

50
00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:24.003
<v Speaker 1>one good thing is just that it's an all </v>
<v Speaker 1>audio program and it really gets you </v>

51
00:02:27.551 --> 00:02:31.480
<v Speaker 1>familiar with the phonology of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>language and the sounds of the language.</v>

52
00:02:31.481 --> 00:02:32.314
<v Speaker 1>And I'm big on that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really think it's important at the </v>

53
00:02:34.481 --> 00:02:37.420
<v Speaker 1>beginning when you learn a language to </v>
<v Speaker 1>really get down the phonology.</v>

54
00:02:37.421 --> 00:02:38.254
<v Speaker 1>I think that's what I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what helps you sync in that </v>

55
00:02:40.421 --> 00:02:43.040
<v Speaker 1>language is what is really getting the </v>
<v Speaker 1>phonology down.</v>

56
00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:45.640
<v Speaker 1>That's kind of the access to the inner </v>
<v Speaker 1>core of the language,</v>

57
00:02:45.641 --> 00:02:46.474
<v Speaker 1>the culture of the language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pimsleur helps you do that because </v>

58
00:02:48.191 --> 00:02:51.310
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're immersed in the sounds right from</v>

59
00:02:51.311 --> 00:02:54.250
<v Speaker 1>the beginning and you're not relying on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the visual input.</v>

60
00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:55.173
<v Speaker 1>You're kind of forced to listen to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>sounds and make sense of them audibly </v>

61
00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:01.270
<v Speaker 1>without having that visual input of </v>
<v Speaker 1>reading.</v>

62
00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:04.600
<v Speaker 1>So it's really good for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

63
00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:05.523
<v Speaker 1>so that's one thing and it does it in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>way that also drills the sentence </v>

64
00:03:07.781 --> 00:03:08.614
<v Speaker 1>structure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're not just like listening and </v>

65
00:03:09.641 --> 00:03:12.040
<v Speaker 1>repeating to sounds or phrases or </v>
<v Speaker 1>sentences.</v>

66
00:03:12.041 --> 00:03:14.050
<v Speaker 1>It's actually building up piece by </v>
<v Speaker 1>piece.</v>

67
00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:14.960
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

68
00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:15.793
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really structured in a way that </v>

69
00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:22.600
<v Speaker 1>helps you to build progressively more </v>
<v Speaker 1>difficult sentences as you go.</v>

70
00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:23.583
<v Speaker 1>Another good thing about pimsleur is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that it uses something called graduated </v>

71
00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:27.543
<v Speaker 1>intervals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is one of the features that it's </v>

72
00:03:29.201 --> 00:03:32.710
<v Speaker 1>famous for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess a graduated intervals means that</v>

73
00:03:32.711 --> 00:03:33.544
<v Speaker 1>you learn some language,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a vocabulary or phrase or a </v>

74
00:03:36.251 --> 00:03:38.830
<v Speaker 1>structure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you review it soon after,</v>

75
00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:42.910
<v Speaker 1>after a short interval of time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then the next time you review it,</v>

76
00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:46.090
<v Speaker 1>the interval of time gets a little </v>
<v Speaker 1>longer and then the next time you review</v>

77
00:03:46.091 --> 00:03:46.924
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a little bit longer between the </v>

78
00:03:47.651 --> 00:03:48.040
<v Speaker 1>reviews.</v>

79
00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:51.010
<v Speaker 1>So the amount of time between each,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

80
00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:51.903
<v Speaker 1>each review,</v>
<v Speaker 1>each time you are asked to recall that </v>

81
00:03:53.891 --> 00:03:58.030
<v Speaker 1>language gets greater and greater.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's good for,</v>

82
00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:03.540
<v Speaker 1>for basically I'm internalizing it into </v>
<v Speaker 1>your longterm memory.</v>

83
00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:06.610
<v Speaker 1>The more times that you review that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that language,</v>

84
00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:08.710
<v Speaker 1>the less frequently you have to review </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

85
00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:09.603
<v Speaker 1>That's basically the point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're familiar with Hunky </v>

86
00:04:11.801 --> 00:04:13.390
<v Speaker 1>flashcards,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they use something,</v>

87
00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:18.630
<v Speaker 1>a similar system to that where I'm the </v>
<v Speaker 1>spaced repetition software.</v>

88
00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:23.530
<v Speaker 1>If you get the card right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then the next time you see it is after a</v>

89
00:04:23.531 --> 00:04:26.140
<v Speaker 1>greater interval.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you get the card wrong or you are not</v>

90
00:04:26.141 --> 00:04:26.974
<v Speaker 1>confident about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you see it after a shorter </v>

91
00:04:28.211 --> 00:04:29.044
<v Speaker 1>interval.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's something similar to graduated </v>

92
00:04:30.221 --> 00:04:31.054
<v Speaker 1>intervals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Another good thing is that it gets you </v>

93
00:04:32.471 --> 00:04:33.304
<v Speaker 1>just to repeat things a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you're repeating the same </v>

94
00:04:34.991 --> 00:04:35.824
<v Speaker 1>structures in the same boat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a basic vocabulary over and over and </v>

95
00:04:38.261 --> 00:04:39.094
<v Speaker 1>over,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and when you're first learning a </v>

96
00:04:40.721 --> 00:04:42.640
<v Speaker 1>language,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's important to do that.</v>

97
00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:43.473
<v Speaker 1>To repeat things over a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to get some automaticity to get things </v>

98
00:04:46.601 --> 00:04:49.900
<v Speaker 1>internalized to the point where you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>say them without really thinking,</v>

99
00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:52.390
<v Speaker 1>especially for structures like basic </v>
<v Speaker 1>sentence structures.</v>

100
00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:53.243
<v Speaker 1>That's good because you get those </v>
<v Speaker 1>structures that come out automatically </v>

101
00:04:55.631 --> 00:05:00.280
<v Speaker 1>and then you can substitute vocabulary </v>
<v Speaker 1>and make new sentences that you've never</v>

102
00:05:00.281 --> 00:05:01.240
<v Speaker 1>made before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

103
00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:02.220
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

104
00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:05.620
<v Speaker 1>it drills a lot of that kind of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It gets you repeating a lot,</v>

105
00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:06.483
<v Speaker 1>but it does it in a way that always </v>
<v Speaker 1>seems like you're learning something </v>

106
00:05:09.161 --> 00:05:10.270
<v Speaker 1>new.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

107
00:05:10.271 --> 00:05:13.930
<v Speaker 1>So onto some of the things that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>imperfect or things that I need,</v>

108
00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:15.850
<v Speaker 1>I think needs to be supplemented or </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

109
00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:16.733
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that the audio only is </v>

110
00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:21.393
<v Speaker 1>always sufficient.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are always some times in a </v>

111
00:05:23.771 --> 00:05:24.604
<v Speaker 1>pimsleur course where I can't clearly </v>
<v Speaker 1>hear what the speaker is saying on the </v>

112
00:05:27.851 --> 00:05:29.090
<v Speaker 1>CDS.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

113
00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:30.433
<v Speaker 1>I think everyone perceives sounds a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little bit differently and there are </v>

114
00:05:32.801 --> 00:05:36.250
<v Speaker 1>sounds that you might be able to </v>
<v Speaker 1>perceive for easily that I hear them and</v>

115
00:05:36.251 --> 00:05:38.140
<v Speaker 1>I can't quite hear what they're saying.</v>

116
00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:39.003
<v Speaker 1>I just don't know what letters those </v>
<v Speaker 1>would come out to if written down or I </v>

117
00:05:42.221 --> 00:05:44.500
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't imagine what the word is.</v>

118
00:05:44.501 --> 00:05:46.920
<v Speaker 1>I can't really perceive the sounds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

119
00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:49.210
<v Speaker 1>and in those kind of situations they </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't really.</v>

120
00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:51.610
<v Speaker 1>They don't know which sounds I'm not </v>
<v Speaker 1>perceiving.</v>

121
00:05:51.611 --> 00:05:52.444
<v Speaker 1>So they don't clarify it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I can't really stick to the pimsleur </v>

122
00:05:56.441 --> 00:05:57.274
<v Speaker 1>philosophy of only listened to the CD,</v>
<v Speaker 1>only use the audio in that kind of </v>

123
00:06:00.351 --> 00:06:03.470
<v Speaker 1>situation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I break their rules and I reached for</v>

124
00:06:03.471 --> 00:06:04.304
<v Speaker 1>my dictionary and look up a word that </v>
<v Speaker 1>sounds like what they're saying or I'll </v>

125
00:06:06.891 --> 00:06:09.770
<v Speaker 1>pause it and I'll try to find,</v>
<v Speaker 1>find out what the word is.</v>

126
00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:11.330
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I,</v>

127
00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:13.850
<v Speaker 1>I need to use some kind of visual input.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

128
00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:15.043
<v Speaker 1>having the visual input in that kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>situation is really helpful because if </v>

129
00:06:18.501 --> 00:06:20.720
<v Speaker 1>you can't perceive the sound once you </v>
<v Speaker 1>see it,</v>

130
00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:25.040
<v Speaker 1>then you can perceive it because you'll </v>
<v Speaker 1>be connecting that mysterious sound with</v>

131
00:06:25.041 --> 00:06:25.874
<v Speaker 1>something visual.</v>

132
00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:26.980
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

133
00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:30.020
<v Speaker 1>so I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't buy the whole audio only thing,</v>

134
00:06:30.021 --> 00:06:32.720
<v Speaker 1>100 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's really good to have a focus</v>

135
00:06:32.721 --> 00:06:33.554
<v Speaker 1>on audio,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially in the beginning in that </v>

136
00:06:34.671 --> 00:06:35.504
<v Speaker 1>solves a lot of the problems of </v>
<v Speaker 1>traditional learning using just books </v>

137
00:06:38.361 --> 00:06:42.020
<v Speaker 1>without a lot of audio or like a book </v>
<v Speaker 1>with just one CD or whatever.</v>

138
00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:45.680
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think it's still good to have some</v>

139
00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:48.890
<v Speaker 1>visual input.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think it's good to do this,</v>

140
00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:52.520
<v Speaker 1>to do pimsleur in conjunction with other</v>
<v Speaker 1>more visual materials.</v>

141
00:06:52.910 --> 00:06:53.743
<v Speaker 1>Another thing is that you just never </v>
<v Speaker 1>quite learn as much as you think you're </v>

142
00:06:56.691 --> 00:06:58.040
<v Speaker 1>going to learn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

143
00:06:58.041 --> 00:07:02.060
<v Speaker 1>I think partly that's because people </v>
<v Speaker 1>look at the size of the course,</v>

144
00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:02.870
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

145
00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:06.710
<v Speaker 1>150 cds for five levels,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or even just like the first two levels.</v>

146
00:07:06.711 --> 00:07:07.930
<v Speaker 1>Wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's 60 cds.</v>

147
00:07:07.931 --> 00:07:11.780
<v Speaker 1>If I finished 60 cds of French,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna have to be fluent,</v>

148
00:07:11.781 --> 00:07:11.960
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

149
00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:14.570
<v Speaker 1>That's 60 whole cds of French.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to have to be really,</v>

150
00:07:14.571 --> 00:07:17.510
<v Speaker 1>really good after that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or they look at the price and they say,</v>

151
00:07:17.511 --> 00:07:18.041
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

152
00:07:18.041 --> 00:07:20.240
<v Speaker 1>it's a thousand dollars for five levels.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

153
00:07:20.241 --> 00:07:21.074
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that must make me fluent that better </v>

154
00:07:22.521 --> 00:07:24.800
<v Speaker 1>make me fluent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm spending a lot of money on that.</v>

155
00:07:25.610 --> 00:07:29.090
<v Speaker 1>But it doesn't really work like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It gives you a good basis,</v>

156
00:07:29.091 --> 00:07:34.091
<v Speaker 1>a good basic understanding and a good </v>
<v Speaker 1>basic anchoring in speaking,</v>

157
00:07:34.491 --> 00:07:37.130
<v Speaker 1>listening,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and interactive skills.</v>

158
00:07:37.190 --> 00:07:41.720
<v Speaker 1>It gives you a good basis to build on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's not gonna make you fluent.</v>

159
00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:44.390
<v Speaker 1>So basically I think pimsleur is really </v>
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>

160
00:07:44.391 --> 00:07:47.030
<v Speaker 1>The only problem I have with it is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>price,</v>

161
00:07:47.031 --> 00:07:49.080
<v Speaker 1>I just think it's too expensive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

162
00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:51.710
<v Speaker 1>I know a lot of work goes into it and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they can charge whatever they want,</v>

163
00:07:51.711 --> 00:07:55.670
<v Speaker 1>but just a lot of people can't really </v>
<v Speaker 1>afford to buy all the levels.</v>

164
00:07:56.730 --> 00:07:59.630
<v Speaker 1>So that's the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what it is.</v>

165
00:07:59.631 --> 00:08:01.400
<v Speaker 1>It's the price,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's good.</v>

166
00:08:01.401 --> 00:08:05.000
<v Speaker 1>It's good quality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's good for building up your,</v>

167
00:08:05.300 --> 00:08:06.133
<v Speaker 1>your listening and your speaking and </v>
<v Speaker 1>your oral communication skills without </v>

168
00:08:09.381 --> 00:08:13.370
<v Speaker 1>relying on the visual too much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that solves some of those problems of</v>

169
00:08:13.371 --> 00:08:18.350
<v Speaker 1>traditional learning we had with just </v>
<v Speaker 1>focusing on written materials too much,</v>

170
00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:19.393
<v Speaker 1>focusing on the visual input too much </v>
<v Speaker 1>and not being able to translate that </v>

171
00:08:22.011 --> 00:08:22.844
<v Speaker 1>into conversations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pimsleur is kind of one of the ways you </v>

172
00:08:25.491 --> 00:08:27.440
<v Speaker 1>can solve that problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

173
00:08:28.230 --> 00:08:30.890
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think pimsleur alone is </v>
<v Speaker 1>enough.</v>

174
00:08:30.891 --> 00:08:33.890
<v Speaker 1>I think you need to supplement it with </v>
<v Speaker 1>visual input.</v>

175
00:08:34.430 --> 00:08:36.560
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even at the same time while you're doing</v>

176
00:08:36.561 --> 00:08:38.780
<v Speaker 1>pimsleur,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pimsleur advises you against that.</v>

177
00:08:39.230 --> 00:08:41.320
<v Speaker 1>I don't believe that I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

178
00:08:41.330 --> 00:08:42.163
<v Speaker 1>I think you should,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should supplement with visual </v>

179
00:08:44.691 --> 00:08:46.000
<v Speaker 1>materials.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Use a textbook,</v>

180
00:08:46.010 --> 00:08:46.843
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

181
00:08:46.850 --> 00:08:47.683
<v Speaker 1>read a authentic materials,</v>
<v Speaker 1>try to use as much visual input as you </v>

182
00:08:51.201 --> 00:08:51.440
<v Speaker 1>can.</v>

183
00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:53.300
<v Speaker 1>Use other sources,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not just the audio,</v>

184
00:08:53.660 --> 00:08:54.493
<v Speaker 1>right in a top of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the audio on the pimsleur cds is </v>

185
00:08:58.051 --> 00:08:58.861
<v Speaker 1>controlled,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

186
00:08:58.861 --> 00:09:00.390
<v Speaker 1>It's controlled practice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

187
00:09:00.420 --> 00:09:02.150
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of repeating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of,</v>

188
00:09:02.151 --> 00:09:03.680
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

189
00:09:03.890 --> 00:09:07.810
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of just question and </v>
<v Speaker 1>answer type of a type of structure.</v>

190
00:09:07.811 --> 00:09:11.430
<v Speaker 1>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really limited in what you hear and</v>

191
00:09:11.431 --> 00:09:16.020
<v Speaker 1>what you're expected to produce.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you need to have experienced from the</v>

192
00:09:16.020 --> 00:09:18.720
<v Speaker 1>beginning in uncontrolled situations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>free practice,</v>

193
00:09:18.750 --> 00:09:19.960
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

194
00:09:20.250 --> 00:09:25.250
<v Speaker 1>that means talk with native speakers in </v>
<v Speaker 1>a context that's not really laid out,</v>

195
00:09:25.710 --> 00:09:26.543
<v Speaker 1>that where you're just conversing and </v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to communicate and figuring out </v>

196
00:09:29.041 --> 00:09:29.874
<v Speaker 1>how to say things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you can do that by getting a </v>

197
00:09:32.071 --> 00:09:35.070
<v Speaker 1>teacher,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a tutor on Italki through skype.</v>

198
00:09:35.071 --> 00:09:35.904
<v Speaker 1>You can take lessons or if someone in </v>
<v Speaker 1>your town speaks that language and they </v>

199
00:09:39.001 --> 00:09:39.834
<v Speaker 1>can tutor you or help you out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can get a language partner and do a </v>

200
00:09:41.851 --> 00:09:43.950
<v Speaker 1>language exchange,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

201
00:09:44.130 --> 00:09:47.340
<v Speaker 1>And then use that as your opportunity to</v>
<v Speaker 1>practice communicating.</v>

202
00:09:47.430 --> 00:09:48.263
<v Speaker 1>And then when there's a communication </v>
<v Speaker 1>breakdown or there's like a language </v>

203
00:09:50.821 --> 00:09:52.440
<v Speaker 1>barrier that can help you get through </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

204
00:09:52.441 --> 00:09:53.340
<v Speaker 1>but telling you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

205
00:09:53.341 --> 00:09:55.560
<v Speaker 1>in this situation we say this and </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

206
00:09:55.561 --> 00:09:56.394
<v Speaker 1>So you learn how to deal with those </v>
<v Speaker 1>unexpected natural situations that come </v>

207
00:10:00.211 --> 00:10:04.480
<v Speaker 1>up in real conversations that you won't </v>
<v Speaker 1>get on the pimsleur cds.</v>

208
00:10:04.481 --> 00:10:05.314
<v Speaker 1>So you need to supplement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you need the visual input and you also </v>

209
00:10:08.611 --> 00:10:10.910
<v Speaker 1>need that free practice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

210
00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:14.940
<v Speaker 1>and if you do the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all those things in conjunction with the</v>

211
00:10:14.941 --> 00:10:15.774
<v Speaker 1>Pimsleur,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you're going to come up with a </v>

212
00:10:16.231 --> 00:10:19.050
<v Speaker 1>really strong base and when you're done </v>
<v Speaker 1>the courses,</v>

213
00:10:19.051 --> 00:10:19.884
<v Speaker 1>you'll be ready to get into some simple </v>
<v Speaker 1>conversations and then build more and </v>

214
00:10:22.531 --> 00:10:24.420
<v Speaker 1>more on top of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So pimsleur is good.</v>

215
00:10:25.070 --> 00:10:26.760
<v Speaker 1>The price,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what to say about it,</v>

216
00:10:26.820 --> 00:10:29.550
<v Speaker 1>but try to get your hands on them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>use them,</v>

217
00:10:29.700 --> 00:10:32.790
<v Speaker 1>but supplement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not the only thing to use,</v>

218
00:10:32.791 --> 00:10:33.624
<v Speaker 1>but it's good.</v>

219
00:10:34.340 --> 00:10:35.173
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
