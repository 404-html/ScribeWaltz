<v Speaker 1>Hello everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My name is Paul and I'm from Canada.</v>

2
00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:13.500
<v Speaker 2>Oh Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3
00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:20.543
<v Speaker 1>Hello everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Welcome to the Lange Focus Channel and </v>

4
00:00:22.411 --> 00:00:26.130
<v Speaker 1>my name is Paul.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Today we'll be going way back to see how</v>

5
00:00:26.131 --> 00:00:27.900
<v Speaker 1>we're all connected.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

6
00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.180
<v Speaker 1>not all of us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but about half of us.</v>

7
00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:31.103
<v Speaker 1>Around 46% of the people on Earth speak </v>
<v Speaker 1>an Indo European language as their </v>

8
00:00:34.891 --> 00:00:37.470
<v Speaker 1>native language throughout Europe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>South Asia,</v>

9
00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:38.333
<v Speaker 1>the Americas and beyond.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Indo European language family </v>

10
00:00:40.921 --> 00:00:43.380
<v Speaker 1>contains languages as diverse as </v>
<v Speaker 1>English,</v>

11
00:00:43.381 --> 00:00:44.550
<v Speaker 1>Hindi,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Persian,</v>

12
00:00:44.551 --> 00:00:45.690
<v Speaker 1>Russian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Armenian,</v>

13
00:00:45.691 --> 00:00:46.524
<v Speaker 1>and Greek languages,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which on the surface may seem to have </v>

14
00:00:48.961 --> 00:00:49.794
<v Speaker 1>nothing in common,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they actually do all Indo European </v>

15
00:00:52.531 --> 00:00:55.440
<v Speaker 1>languages developed from Prodo Indo </v>
<v Speaker 1>European.</v>

16
00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:56.363
<v Speaker 1>According to the most widely accepted </v>
<v Speaker 1>theory prodo Indo European was spoken </v>

17
00:00:59.521 --> 00:01:00.354
<v Speaker 1>around 6,500</v>
<v Speaker 1>years ago on the Eurasian Steppe of </v>

18
00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:04.830
<v Speaker 1>eastern Ukraine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>southern Russia,</v>

19
00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:05.693
<v Speaker 1>and the Caucasus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Indo Europeans were the first or </v>

20
00:01:07.921 --> 00:01:10.530
<v Speaker 1>among the first people to domesticate </v>
<v Speaker 1>horses,</v>

21
00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:11.393
<v Speaker 1>which greatly increased their ability to</v>
<v Speaker 1>travel and migrate over the following </v>

22
00:01:15.331 --> 00:01:16.290
<v Speaker 1>three Millennia.</v>

23
00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.050
<v Speaker 1>Indo European people migrated far and </v>
<v Speaker 1>wide,</v>

24
00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:19.943
<v Speaker 1>conquering new lands on horseback and </v>
<v Speaker 1>bringing their language with them as it </v>

25
00:01:23.011 --> 00:01:23.844
<v Speaker 1>developed into different varieties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which eventually grew into different </v>

26
00:01:26.491 --> 00:01:28.890
<v Speaker 1>branches of the Indo European language </v>
<v Speaker 1>family.</v>

27
00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.560
<v Speaker 1>The Indo Europeans first migrated into </v>
<v Speaker 1>Europe,</v>

28
00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.180
<v Speaker 1>Anatolia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Central Asia.</v>

29
00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:34.193
<v Speaker 1>Then later into northern India and Iran.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As migration continued deeper into </v>

30
00:01:37.471 --> 00:01:38.304
<v Speaker 1>Europe and Central Asia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's an alternate theory based more </v>

31
00:01:41.311 --> 00:01:42.144
<v Speaker 1>on archeological evidence that suggests </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the Indo European languages began </v>

32
00:01:45.781 --> 00:01:49.860
<v Speaker 1>in Anatolia several thousand years </v>
<v Speaker 1>earlier and spread with the expansion of</v>

33
00:01:49.861 --> 00:01:50.694
<v Speaker 1>agriculture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are no written records of Prodo </v>

34
00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.970
<v Speaker 1>Indo European and it's early offshoots,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the best we can do is to theorize and</v>

35
00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:57.863
<v Speaker 1>imagine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>However they happened to take place </v>

36
00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:00.443
<v Speaker 1>during these migrations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Prodo Indo European split into numerous </v>

37
00:02:03.241 --> 00:02:07.110
<v Speaker 1>different languages which would </v>
<v Speaker 1>gradually developed into entire branches</v>

38
00:02:07.111 --> 00:02:11.070
<v Speaker 1>of the Indo European language family.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those branches are and a Anatolian,</v>

39
00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.320
<v Speaker 1>which is now extinct,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tow Korean,</v>

40
00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.670
<v Speaker 1>which is also extinct Italia and Celtic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which may share a common he tello,</v>

41
00:02:17.671 --> 00:02:20.190
<v Speaker 1>Celtic ancestor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Armenian and Albanian,</v>

42
00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:23.220
<v Speaker 1>which each consists of just one language</v>
<v Speaker 1>as far as we know,</v>

43
00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:25.440
<v Speaker 1>Hellenic Germanic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Balto,</v>

44
00:02:25.441 --> 00:02:26.274
<v Speaker 1>Slavic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which split into the Baltic and Slavic </v>

45
00:02:28.111 --> 00:02:28.944
<v Speaker 1>branches and into Iranian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which split into the ironic and indic </v>

46
00:02:31.921 --> 00:02:32.754
<v Speaker 1>branches.</v>

47
00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:34.073
<v Speaker 1>All of these branches and their </v>
<v Speaker 1>individual languages have been </v>

48
00:02:35.971 --> 00:02:36.804
<v Speaker 1>developing in different regions with </v>
<v Speaker 1>different influences for thousands of </v>

49
00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:41.730
<v Speaker 1>years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they are now very different from each</v>

50
00:02:41.731 --> 00:02:44.040
<v Speaker 1>other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but through comparative study we can see</v>

51
00:02:44.041 --> 00:02:44.874
<v Speaker 1>that Indo European languages share a </v>
<v Speaker 1>common word stock as well as some </v>

52
00:02:47.701 --> 00:02:48.534
<v Speaker 1>phonetic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>

53
00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:51.270
<v Speaker 1>historically speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some grammatical tendencies.</v>

54
00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:52.223
<v Speaker 1>There are a significant number of </v>
<v Speaker 1>cognitive words in Indo European </v>

55
00:02:54.661 --> 00:02:55.980
<v Speaker 1>languages.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>

56
00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.890
<v Speaker 1>the word cognate comes from Latin </v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible],</v>

57
00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:02.680
<v Speaker 1>which means born together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These words were indeed born together in</v>

58
00:03:02.681 --> 00:03:03.514
<v Speaker 1>Prato Indo Europeans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if we're aware of the sound changes </v>

59
00:03:05.801 --> 00:03:08.380
<v Speaker 1>that have taken place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can identify cognates.</v>

60
00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:11.470
<v Speaker 1>For instance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the word meaning bear or carry.</v>

61
00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:13.870
<v Speaker 1>In Sanskrit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the hod.</v>

62
00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:15.880
<v Speaker 1>In Greek,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's pad.</v>

63
00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:17.073
<v Speaker 1>In modern Greek.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This might be pronounced like an f </v>

64
00:03:18.491 --> 00:03:19.324
<v Speaker 1>sound,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in ancient Greek it was actually an </v>

65
00:03:20.861 --> 00:03:23.590
<v Speaker 1>aspirated pup sound.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In Latin,</v>

66
00:03:23.591 --> 00:03:26.220
<v Speaker 1>it's fed in Gothic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's by it.</v>

67
00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:28.240
<v Speaker 1>In old English,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's bad.</v>

68
00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:31.540
<v Speaker 1>They all come from Prodo Indo European </v>
<v Speaker 1>by head,</v>

69
00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:34.960
<v Speaker 1>and my pronunciation of these different </v>
<v Speaker 1>languages is probably not perfect,</v>

70
00:03:34.961 --> 00:03:35.794
<v Speaker 1>but I'm just giving it a shot myself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I should point out that the Prodo Indo </v>

71
00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:39.903
<v Speaker 1>European words are theoretical </v>
<v Speaker 1>reconstructions and that there's no way </v>

72
00:03:42.191 --> 00:03:44.110
<v Speaker 1>of knowing for sure what they sounded </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

73
00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:46.600
<v Speaker 1>but these words here are fairly </v>
<v Speaker 1>recognizable.</v>

74
00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:49.030
<v Speaker 1>Some are a little less recognizable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In English,</v>

75
00:03:49.031 --> 00:03:51.910
<v Speaker 1>we have the word work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which comes from old English.</v>

76
00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:53.800
<v Speaker 1>We had a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and in modern Greek,</v>

77
00:03:53.801 --> 00:03:58.801
<v Speaker 1>the word for work is edit goal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was Aragon in ancient Greek and in</v>

78
00:03:58.871 --> 00:04:01.700
<v Speaker 1>some texts there was an alternate form </v>
<v Speaker 1>whether gone,</v>

79
00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:04.840
<v Speaker 1>they both stem from the pro Indo </v>
<v Speaker 1>European word,</v>

80
00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:09.790
<v Speaker 1>wedding film Indo European languages can</v>
<v Speaker 1>be divided into two classes,</v>

81
00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:12.550
<v Speaker 1>the chem tomb languages and the sultan </v>
<v Speaker 1>languages.</v>

82
00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:15.610
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] is the word for 100 in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Avastin,</v>

83
00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:17.320
<v Speaker 1>an ancient Iranian language.</v>

84
00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:22.210
<v Speaker 1>Centum is the word for 100 in Latin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These two words illustrate a sound shift</v>

85
00:04:22.211 --> 00:04:24.250
<v Speaker 1>that occurred in Indo European </v>
<v Speaker 1>languages.</v>

86
00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:29.110
<v Speaker 1>Prodo Indo European had a palatalized k </v>
<v Speaker 1>sound that was distinct from the regular</v>

87
00:04:29.111 --> 00:04:29.944
<v Speaker 1>vilar k sound,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a palatalized consonant sounds kind of </v>

88
00:04:32.291 --> 00:04:33.124
<v Speaker 1>like it's followed by a y sound like </v>
<v Speaker 1>cure as opposed to cook in the Septum </v>

89
00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:37.923
<v Speaker 1>languages.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This palatalized sound remained a </v>

90
00:04:39.941 --> 00:04:44.941
<v Speaker 1>separate phoneme from cup and it became </v>
<v Speaker 1>a civil and sound like a sub or a show.</v>

91
00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:50.670
<v Speaker 1>So the Prodo Indo European word for 100 </v>
<v Speaker 1>cutone became Chatam in Sanskrit,</v>

92
00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:54.940
<v Speaker 1>Shim Taz in Lithuanian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and in many Slavic languages.</v>

93
00:04:54.941 --> 00:04:55.774
<v Speaker 1>It's stole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These words have all developed and </v>

94
00:04:57.881 --> 00:04:58.714
<v Speaker 1>diverged quite a bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you're aware of the sound shift </v>

95
00:05:00.701 --> 00:05:01.534
<v Speaker 1>from a k sound to an s sound,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can recognize these cognates more </v>

96
00:05:04.361 --> 00:05:08.170
<v Speaker 1>easily in the Ken tomb languages.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The twoK sounds merged together,</v>

97
00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:11.740
<v Speaker 1>or in the case of the dramatic branch </v>
<v Speaker 1>shifted to an h sound.</v>

98
00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:12.783
<v Speaker 1>So cute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tome became centum in Latin and hey </v>

99
00:05:15.841 --> 00:05:20.530
<v Speaker 1>catone in Greek cunt in Welsh and honed </v>
<v Speaker 1>in old English.</v>

100
00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:24.910
<v Speaker 1>So let's take a look at these two words.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In English hundred and sent,</v>

101
00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:25.893
<v Speaker 1>we usually think of hundred as a native </v>
<v Speaker 1>Germanic word and sent as a lone word </v>

102
00:05:29.261 --> 00:05:31.510
<v Speaker 1>from Latin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but these are actually cognitive.</v>

103
00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:32.403
<v Speaker 1>First,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's take away the ending of the word </v>

104
00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:35.470
<v Speaker 1>ribbed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which comes from a suffix,</v>

105
00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:40.150
<v Speaker 1>meaning count or number that let's </v>
<v Speaker 1>change the h back to a k and now you can</v>

106
00:05:40.151 --> 00:05:42.910
<v Speaker 1>kind of see the resemblance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See the resemblance.</v>

107
00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:46.600
<v Speaker 1>Remember that the sea in insent was </v>
<v Speaker 1>originally pronounced like a k,</v>

108
00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:48.580
<v Speaker 1>Cook and Latin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Also,</v>

109
00:05:48.581 --> 00:05:51.520
<v Speaker 1>remember that d is the voice equivalent </v>
<v Speaker 1>of tea,</v>

110
00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:55.000
<v Speaker 1>so you can often see these sounds </v>
<v Speaker 1>alternating and related languages.</v>

111
00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:56.853
<v Speaker 1>Some core words have been preserved in </v>
<v Speaker 1>many or even all Indo European </v>

112
00:05:59.751 --> 00:06:01.880
<v Speaker 1>languages.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These include some animals.</v>

113
00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:03.260
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Prodo Indo,</v>

114
00:06:03.261 --> 00:06:05.960
<v Speaker 1>European equals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This means horse.</v>

115
00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:08.750
<v Speaker 1>You know that equestrian animal in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Latin,</v>

116
00:06:08.751 --> 00:06:11.000
<v Speaker 1>it's equis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In ancient Greek,</v>

117
00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:13.550
<v Speaker 1>it was keep us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In Sanskrit,</v>

118
00:06:13.551 --> 00:06:14.384
<v Speaker 1>it's Ashford and in Persian it's aspect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Latin and Greek examples are to him </v>

119
00:06:18.741 --> 00:06:19.574
<v Speaker 1>examples,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in Greek it seems that the k sound </v>

120
00:06:21.501 --> 00:06:22.334
<v Speaker 1>assimilated to the pcaob next to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Sanskrit in Persian examples are </v>

121
00:06:25.731 --> 00:06:26.900
<v Speaker 1>sought them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Examples,</v>

122
00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:30.140
<v Speaker 1>since you can see that the k sound </v>
<v Speaker 1>became shuck and suck,</v>

123
00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:34.850
<v Speaker 1>it also seems that the w sound shifted </v>
<v Speaker 1>to a v sounded Sanskrit and to uh,</v>

124
00:06:34.851 --> 00:06:35.684
<v Speaker 1>be sound in Persian and those are sound </v>
<v Speaker 1>changes that take place frequently in </v>

125
00:06:38.691 --> 00:06:39.524
<v Speaker 1>various different languages.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Other frequent cognates include the </v>

126
00:06:41.721 --> 00:06:44.690
<v Speaker 1>numbers from one to 10 words referring </v>
<v Speaker 1>to family members,</v>

127
00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:45.853
<v Speaker 1>agricultural words and various natural </v>
<v Speaker 1>phenomena like the words for tree and </v>

128
00:06:49.431 --> 00:06:54.431
<v Speaker 1>wood in Prodo Indo European Dodo or Dre,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you in old English today,</v>

129
00:06:54.941 --> 00:06:58.910
<v Speaker 1>Ale in Gothic put a u in ancient Greek </v>
<v Speaker 1>Dota,</v>

130
00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:00.163
<v Speaker 1>which actually meant spear in Sanskrit </v>
<v Speaker 1>Daadab in old church slavonic don't </v>

131
00:07:04.461 --> 00:07:08.480
<v Speaker 1>evolve in Armenian zod this shared </v>
<v Speaker 1>vocabulary.</v>

132
00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:10.760
<v Speaker 1>It might be hard to spot when you're not</v>
<v Speaker 1>looking for it,</v>

133
00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:11.863
<v Speaker 1>but when you start to notice the sounds </v>
<v Speaker 1>that commonly alternate in those </v>

134
00:07:14.301 --> 00:07:15.590
<v Speaker 1>cognates,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

135
00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:19.880
<v Speaker 1>the voiceless t and the voice deep,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then cognit start to be more obvious.</v>

136
00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:21.073
<v Speaker 1>Indo European languages have developed </v>
<v Speaker 1>so far from pro Indo European that </v>

137
00:07:24.291 --> 00:07:25.124
<v Speaker 1>grammatically they are very diverse and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they have many features that other Indo </v>

138
00:07:27.861 --> 00:07:28.694
<v Speaker 1>European languages don't share.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But because Prodo Indo European was a </v>

139
00:07:32.001 --> 00:07:32.834
<v Speaker 1>highly inflected language,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of its descendants are inflected </v>

140
00:07:35.421 --> 00:07:37.670
<v Speaker 1>language is to some extent by </v>
<v Speaker 1>inflection,</v>

141
00:07:37.671 --> 00:07:38.504
<v Speaker 1>I mean that words change form to reflect</v>
<v Speaker 1>grammatical functions like number </v>

142
00:07:42.171 --> 00:07:44.660
<v Speaker 1>person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tense mood case.</v>

143
00:07:44.690 --> 00:07:45.523
<v Speaker 1>One example is the verb endings we find </v>
<v Speaker 1>in various Indo European languages in </v>

144
00:07:49.221 --> 00:07:52.790
<v Speaker 1>Prodo Indo European,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the reconstructed singular forms for the</v>

145
00:07:52.791 --> 00:07:55.990
<v Speaker 1>verb to bear our pedal or the head of </v>
<v Speaker 1>me,</v>

146
00:07:56.430 --> 00:07:57.263
<v Speaker 1>the head of seat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that a t and in Sanskrit the had Ami </v>

147
00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:03.553
<v Speaker 1>Darcy Bahati in Latin Fedele fetis fed </v>
<v Speaker 1>it in old English better or Bentyl </v>

148
00:08:11.270 --> 00:08:15.830
<v Speaker 1>biddies biddies in many languages,</v>
<v Speaker 1>including English.</v>

149
00:08:15.860 --> 00:08:18.350
<v Speaker 1>These inflections have been lost to a </v>
<v Speaker 1>large extent.</v>

150
00:08:18.530 --> 00:08:19.363
<v Speaker 1>In modern English,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we only retained the third person </v>

151
00:08:21.111 --> 00:08:23.420
<v Speaker 1>inflection.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He bears or she bears,</v>

152
00:08:23.540 --> 00:08:24.373
<v Speaker 1>but English still had the second person </v>
<v Speaker 1>inflection until the early modern </v>

153
00:08:26.991 --> 00:08:29.630
<v Speaker 1>English period.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you read a King James Bible,</v>

154
00:08:29.660 --> 00:08:32.990
<v Speaker 1>you'll see the sentence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thou barest record of myself.</v>

155
00:08:33.140 --> 00:08:33.973
<v Speaker 1>This is the second person form and val </v>
<v Speaker 1>means you cases pro Indo European nouns </v>

156
00:08:39.021 --> 00:08:41.510
<v Speaker 1>had inflections for eight grammatical </v>
<v Speaker 1>cases.</v>

157
00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:42.433
<v Speaker 1>Sanskrit maintained all eight cases and </v>
<v Speaker 1>so did the ancient Iranian language of </v>

158
00:08:45.931 --> 00:08:50.780
<v Speaker 1>Estin Latin retained six cases and old </v>
<v Speaker 1>English had for modern English.</v>

159
00:08:50.781 --> 00:08:51.614
<v Speaker 1>Nounce do not have case endings and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's also true for many other Indo </v>

160
00:08:54.351 --> 00:08:57.270
<v Speaker 1>European languages like most of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>romance languages,</v>

161
00:08:57.330 --> 00:08:59.820
<v Speaker 1>when language is no longer have case </v>
<v Speaker 1>inflections,</v>

162
00:08:59.970 --> 00:09:00.803
<v Speaker 1>the function of nouns is indicated more </v>
<v Speaker 1>by word order and by the use of </v>

163
00:09:03.631 --> 00:09:04.464
<v Speaker 1>prepositions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But many modern Indo European languages </v>

164
00:09:06.661 --> 00:09:10.080
<v Speaker 1>do have numerous cases like most Balto,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Slavic languages,</v>

165
00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:13.110
<v Speaker 1>which have six to eight cases,</v>
<v Speaker 1>German and Icelandic,</v>

166
00:09:13.170 --> 00:09:16.530
<v Speaker 1>which have four cases and modern Greek,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which also has four.</v>

167
00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:18.473
<v Speaker 1>So the connection between the modern </v>
<v Speaker 1>Indo European languages may not be </v>

168
00:09:21.450 --> 00:09:22.283
<v Speaker 1>obvious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when we look back historically at </v>

169
00:09:23.791 --> 00:09:27.360
<v Speaker 1>how those languages have developed and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the different stages of those languages,</v>

170
00:09:27.420 --> 00:09:30.420
<v Speaker 1>we can find more connections.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The question of the day,</v>

171
00:09:30.450 --> 00:09:31.283
<v Speaker 1>if you speak in Indo European language,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did you discover any new connections </v>

172
00:09:34.381 --> 00:09:36.720
<v Speaker 1>between your language and others during </v>
<v Speaker 1>this video?</v>
