<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

3
00:00:04.631 --> 00:00:05.920
<v Speaker 1>what should we do today?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Today?</v>

4
00:00:05.921 --> 00:00:07.870
<v Speaker 1>Let's talk about Chinese.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

5
00:00:07.871 --> 00:00:09.610
<v Speaker 1>let's talk about written Chinese.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

6
00:00:09.611 --> 00:00:12.940
<v Speaker 1>let's talk about classical Chinese or </v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe standard Chinese.</v>

7
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:13.301
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

8
00:00:13.301 --> 00:00:15.730
<v Speaker 1>We're going to talk about various </v>
<v Speaker 1>Chinese dialects.</v>

9
00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:17.530
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's just talk about all of them.</v>

10
00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:24.153
<v Speaker 1>Hello everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Welcome to the Lange Focus Channel and </v>

11
00:00:25.931 --> 00:00:29.530
<v Speaker 1>my name is Paul.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Today we're going to talk about Chinese,</v>

12
00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:32.740
<v Speaker 1>but the big question is what do I mean </v>
<v Speaker 1>when I say Chinese?</v>

13
00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:35.530
<v Speaker 1>The word Chinese refers to standard </v>
<v Speaker 1>Chinese,</v>

14
00:00:35.531 --> 00:00:36.364
<v Speaker 1>which is based on Mandarin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it also refers to a large group of </v>

15
00:00:38.921 --> 00:00:42.610
<v Speaker 1>languages and dialects spoken throughout</v>
<v Speaker 1>China and indeed throughout the world.</v>

16
00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:47.700
<v Speaker 1>Chinese languages also called synetic </v>
<v Speaker 1>languages or a sub family of the silo.</v>

17
00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:51.040
<v Speaker 1>Tibetan language family.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chinese is not a single language,</v>

18
00:00:51.041 --> 00:00:51.874
<v Speaker 1>but rather a number of related dialect </v>
<v Speaker 1>groups which are united by a common </v>

19
00:00:55.151 --> 00:00:57.310
<v Speaker 1>written language,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a common writing system.</v>

20
00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:00.070
<v Speaker 1>Some people consider them all Chinese </v>
<v Speaker 1>dialects,</v>

21
00:01:00.071 --> 00:01:00.904
<v Speaker 1>but I'm going to refer to these dialect </v>
<v Speaker 1>groups as distinct languages because in </v>

22
00:01:03.941 --> 00:01:04.774
<v Speaker 1>many cases they are unintelligible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All Chinese languages are tonal </v>

23
00:01:07.931 --> 00:01:08.764
<v Speaker 1>languages.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The meaning of a word depends on the </v>

24
00:01:10.541 --> 00:01:13.290
<v Speaker 1>tone or the tones that you say it with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

25
00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:17.170
<v Speaker 1>She Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you change the tone,</v>

26
00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:20.530
<v Speaker 1>the meaning of the word changes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there were more than 1.3</v>

27
00:01:20.531 --> 00:01:24.220
<v Speaker 1>billion native speakers of Chinese.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we include all its varieties.</v>

28
00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:25.413
<v Speaker 1>Standard Chinese generally referred to </v>
<v Speaker 1>as Mandarin is the official language of </v>

29
00:01:28.961 --> 00:01:31.750
<v Speaker 1>the People's Republic of China,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Republic of China,</v>

30
00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:35.230
<v Speaker 1>also known as Taiwan or Chinese.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Taipei.</v>

31
00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.640
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

32
00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:40.520
<v Speaker 1>And it's one of the four official </v>
<v Speaker 1>languages of Singapore.</v>

33
00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:41.533
<v Speaker 1>Chinese languages are also spoken in </v>
<v Speaker 1>lots of diaspora communities throughout </v>

34
00:01:44.721 --> 00:01:46.220
<v Speaker 1>Asia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like in Malaysia,</v>

35
00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:49.610
<v Speaker 1>Indonesia and Thailand and in different </v>
<v Speaker 1>communities around the world.</v>

36
00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:51.123
<v Speaker 1>History,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sign nick languages or the Chinese </v>

37
00:01:53.351 --> 00:01:56.350
<v Speaker 1>languages developed from Prodo Sino </v>
<v Speaker 1>Tibetan,</v>

38
00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:59.470
<v Speaker 1>which existed perhaps around 4,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>bce.</v>

39
00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:04.870
<v Speaker 1>The earliest written examples of Chinese</v>
<v Speaker 1>are from around 1250 bce.</v>

40
00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:09.190
<v Speaker 1>They were written using a form of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Chinese called the oracle bone script,</v>

41
00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:11.950
<v Speaker 1>which was carved onto turtle shells and </v>
<v Speaker 1>animal bones,</v>

42
00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:14.980
<v Speaker 1>which were used for divination,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a kind of fortune telling,</v>

43
00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:16.083
<v Speaker 1>a more recognizable form of old Chinese </v>
<v Speaker 1>developed during the Jo Dynasty between </v>

44
00:02:19.691 --> 00:02:22.210
<v Speaker 1>10:46</v>
<v Speaker 1>AM two 56 bce.</v>

45
00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:25.990
<v Speaker 1>It can be found on bronze sculptures </v>
<v Speaker 1>from that time period as well as in some</v>

46
00:02:25.991 --> 00:02:26.824
<v Speaker 1>literature like a classic of poetry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's generally thought that during this </v>

47
00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:32.890
<v Speaker 1>early time period Chinese had not yet </v>
<v Speaker 1>developed tones.</v>

48
00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:35.830
<v Speaker 1>Those develops later in the transition </v>
<v Speaker 1>to middle Chinese,</v>

49
00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:36.723
<v Speaker 1>the form of written Chinese that </v>
<v Speaker 1>developed between this period and the </v>

50
00:02:39.491 --> 00:02:41.770
<v Speaker 1>end of the Han Dynasty in the third </v>
<v Speaker 1>century.</v>

51
00:02:41.771 --> 00:02:45.730
<v Speaker 1>Ce is known as classical Chinese or </v>
<v Speaker 1>literary Chinese.</v>

52
00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:51.340
<v Speaker 1>Classical Chinese continued to be used </v>
<v Speaker 1>as the formal written language until the</v>

53
00:02:51.341 --> 00:02:52.174
<v Speaker 1>beginning of the 20th century spoken.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chinese continued to evolve into middle </v>

54
00:02:55.691 --> 00:03:00.691
<v Speaker 1>Chinese.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Middle Chinese is ancestor of almost all</v>

55
00:03:00.791 --> 00:03:04.390
<v Speaker 1>modern Chinese varieties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The exception is Min Chinese,</v>

56
00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:07.120
<v Speaker 1>which developed earlier maybe during the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Han period.</v>

57
00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:10.570
<v Speaker 1>Middle Chinese was not a single unified </v>
<v Speaker 1>language,</v>

58
00:03:10.571 --> 00:03:11.404
<v Speaker 1>but consisted of a number of mutually </v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligible dialects that began </v>

59
00:03:14.291 --> 00:03:17.710
<v Speaker 1>diverging in different directions around</v>
<v Speaker 1>the 10th century Ce,</v>

60
00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:18.843
<v Speaker 1>and you'll probably hear me say that </v>
<v Speaker 1>every time I talk about a language </v>

61
00:03:20.771 --> 00:03:21.604
<v Speaker 1>family,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those local varieties of Chinese </v>

62
00:03:22.991 --> 00:03:23.824
<v Speaker 1>continued to develop in their own </v>
<v Speaker 1>directions as distinct languages over </v>

63
00:03:26.621 --> 00:03:27.454
<v Speaker 1>the centuries with a lot of local </v>
<v Speaker 1>dialectal variation within each </v>

64
00:03:30.431 --> 00:03:32.320
<v Speaker 1>language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As I mentioned before,</v>

65
00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:35.680
<v Speaker 1>classical Chinese was being used as the </v>
<v Speaker 1>formal written language,</v>

66
00:03:35.681 --> 00:03:38.230
<v Speaker 1>but during this time period written </v>
<v Speaker 1>vernacular,</v>

67
00:03:38.231 --> 00:03:39.064
<v Speaker 1>Chinese also developed alongside it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>written for an ocular Chinese refers to </v>

68
00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:43.563
<v Speaker 1>ways of writing Chinese that reflect the</v>
<v Speaker 1>spoken language in its different </v>

69
00:03:46.331 --> 00:03:47.164
<v Speaker 1>varieties.</v>

70
00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:50.320
<v Speaker 1>These forms of Chinese were used for </v>
<v Speaker 1>some informal writing.</v>

71
00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:52.660
<v Speaker 1>People were already writing and written </v>
<v Speaker 1>vernacular,</v>

72
00:03:52.661 --> 00:03:53.494
<v Speaker 1>Chinese during the tongue and some </v>
<v Speaker 1>dynasties from the seventh to 13th </v>

73
00:03:56.951 --> 00:03:58.900
<v Speaker 1>century CE,</v>
<v Speaker 1>old Mandarin.</v>

74
00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:04.660
<v Speaker 1>After the Northern Song Dynasty and </v>
<v Speaker 1>during the gene and you end dynasties,</v>

75
00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:07.900
<v Speaker 1>a language recognizable as a form of </v>
<v Speaker 1>mentoring was spoken.</v>

76
00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:10.780
<v Speaker 1>This variety of Chinese is known as Old </v>
<v Speaker 1>Mandarin.</v>

77
00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:14.560
<v Speaker 1>The UN dynasty was a period of Mongol </v>
<v Speaker 1>control of China.</v>

78
00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:18.940
<v Speaker 1>The world's leading up to the Mongol </v>
<v Speaker 1>conquest caused large scale migration of</v>

79
00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:19.803
<v Speaker 1>old mandarin speakers to the south.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This spread early mandarin dialects to </v>

80
00:04:22.931 --> 00:04:27.100
<v Speaker 1>more areas and also had an influence on </v>
<v Speaker 1>other emerging Chinese languages.</v>

81
00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:28.143
<v Speaker 1>Middle Mandarin during the Ming and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Ching dynasties and official </v>

82
00:04:31.091 --> 00:04:31.924
<v Speaker 1>administrative language was created </v>
<v Speaker 1>based on the mandarin dialect of the </v>

83
00:04:34.901 --> 00:04:38.380
<v Speaker 1>capitol non Jean with some features of </v>
<v Speaker 1>other dialects as well.</v>

84
00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:42.070
<v Speaker 1>This was the first point at which the </v>
<v Speaker 1>language became referred to as Mandarin,</v>

85
00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:45.430
<v Speaker 1>which means speech of officials.</v>

86
00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:46.473
<v Speaker 1>We now refer to the stage of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>language as middle mandarin in the late </v>

87
00:04:50.711 --> 00:04:53.590
<v Speaker 1>19th century towards the end of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Ching Dynasty.</v>

88
00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:57.970
<v Speaker 1>The specific dialect of Beijing started </v>
<v Speaker 1>to grow in importance and became the new</v>

89
00:04:57.971 --> 00:04:58.804
<v Speaker 1>high variety of Chinese replacing the </v>
<v Speaker 1>older high variety which was based on a </v>

90
00:05:02.441 --> 00:05:06.040
<v Speaker 1>number of different dialects at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>beginning of the 20th century,</v>

91
00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:06.963
<v Speaker 1>a form of written vernacular,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chinese based on a number of mandarin </v>

92
00:05:09.701 --> 00:05:10.534
<v Speaker 1>dialects was introduced as the new </v>
<v Speaker 1>official written language instead of </v>

93
00:05:13.841 --> 00:05:14.674
<v Speaker 1>classical Chinese,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was later decided that the new </v>

94
00:05:16.781 --> 00:05:20.440
<v Speaker 1>official language should be based </v>
<v Speaker 1>specifically on the Beijing dialect.</v>

95
00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:21.303
<v Speaker 1>This new standard language was called,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which means common language or which </v>

96
00:05:27.191 --> 00:05:28.024
<v Speaker 1>means national language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People often refer to this standard </v>

97
00:05:30.491 --> 00:05:34.510
<v Speaker 1>language as mandarin because it's based </v>
<v Speaker 1>on the mandarin dialect of Beijing.</v>

98
00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:35.553
<v Speaker 1>But to be precise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the word mandarin refers to a range of </v>

99
00:05:37.991 --> 00:05:39.130
<v Speaker 1>northern dialect.</v>

100
00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:43.360
<v Speaker 1>Standard Chinese or Mandarin now </v>
<v Speaker 1>fulfills the role that classical Chinese</v>

101
00:05:43.361 --> 00:05:44.194
<v Speaker 1>used to fulfill as the official written </v>
<v Speaker 1>language that's used by speakers of all </v>

102
00:05:47.471 --> 00:05:48.304
<v Speaker 1>varieties of Chinese for most purposes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but written vernacular languages still </v>

103
00:05:52.121 --> 00:05:55.030
<v Speaker 1>do exist and are used for some informal </v>
<v Speaker 1>situations.</v>

104
00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:57.350
<v Speaker 1>So how many varieties of Chinese are </v>
<v Speaker 1>there?</v>

105
00:05:57.410 --> 00:05:58.243
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that depends on how you're counting and </v>

106
00:05:59.181 --> 00:06:00.014
<v Speaker 1>categorizing them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's often said that there are over </v>

107
00:06:01.761 --> 00:06:02.594
<v Speaker 1>200 distinct varieties of Chinese,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which comprise around 13 distinct </v>

108
00:06:06.471 --> 00:06:07.304
<v Speaker 1>dialect can groups the local dialects </v>
<v Speaker 1>within each of these groups are often </v>

109
00:06:10.701 --> 00:06:11.534
<v Speaker 1>intelligible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's reasonable to consider these </v>

110
00:06:13.281 --> 00:06:17.690
<v Speaker 1>groups as languages at least I think so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Out of these 13 groups of dialects,</v>

111
00:06:17.691 --> 00:06:20.390
<v Speaker 1>there are seven that are generally </v>
<v Speaker 1>considered a major.</v>

112
00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:25.660
<v Speaker 1>These are mandarin UAA Shung men by done</v>
<v Speaker 1>gone.</v>

113
00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:30.113
<v Speaker 1>You</v>

114
00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:33.050
<v Speaker 3>and hot got,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Huh?</v>

115
00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:38.230
<v Speaker 1>The writing system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chinese is written in Chinese characters</v>

116
00:06:38.290 --> 00:06:43.150
<v Speaker 1>or Hudson Han.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Soo are logograms single characters that</v>

117
00:06:43.151 --> 00:06:46.300
<v Speaker 1>represent entire words or entire units </v>
<v Speaker 1>of meaning.</v>

118
00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:48.370
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this character means China.</v>

119
00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:49.263
<v Speaker 1>In this character means character as in </v>
<v Speaker 1>a written character and together they </v>

120
00:06:52.511 --> 00:06:56.530
<v Speaker 1>mean Chinese character or Han Zu,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the kind we're talking about.</v>

121
00:06:56.710 --> 00:06:57.543
<v Speaker 1>These characters need to be learned one </v>
<v Speaker 1>by one because just knowing the </v>

122
00:07:00.251 --> 00:07:04.000
<v Speaker 1>pronunciation of a word doesn't give you</v>
<v Speaker 1>any indication of how to write it.</v>

123
00:07:04.030 --> 00:07:04.863
<v Speaker 1>Speakers of all varieties of Chinese </v>
<v Speaker 1>typically right in standard Chinese or </v>

124
00:07:08.081 --> 00:07:08.914
<v Speaker 1>mandarin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though their spoken language is </v>

125
00:07:10.271 --> 00:07:13.100
<v Speaker 1>different when the reading standard </v>
<v Speaker 1>Chinese out loud,</v>

126
00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:13.973
<v Speaker 1>they'll probably pronounce each </v>
<v Speaker 1>character the way it's pronounced in </v>

127
00:07:16.301 --> 00:07:20.170
<v Speaker 1>their local variety of Chinese.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This has led to the common misconception</v>

128
00:07:20.171 --> 00:07:24.190
<v Speaker 1>that all Chinese languages are exactly </v>
<v Speaker 1>the same except for their pronunciation.</v>

129
00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:28.990
<v Speaker 1>The fact is Chinese languages often </v>
<v Speaker 1>differ in grammar and vocabulary as well</v>

130
00:07:28.991 --> 00:07:29.980
<v Speaker 1>as pronunciation.</v>

131
00:07:30.310 --> 00:07:31.143
<v Speaker 1>The various forms of written vernacular,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chinese that developed alongside </v>

132
00:07:34.061 --> 00:07:37.510
<v Speaker 1>classical Chinese still exist today </v>
<v Speaker 1>alongside standard Chinese.</v>

133
00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:39.880
<v Speaker 1>They're only used in some limited </v>
<v Speaker 1>situations,</v>

134
00:07:39.881 --> 00:07:40.714
<v Speaker 1>but Cantonese in particular is fairly </v>
<v Speaker 1>widely used from what I understand most </v>

135
00:07:44.621 --> 00:07:45.454
<v Speaker 1>of the characters used are the same,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there'll be pronounced differently </v>

136
00:07:47.890 --> 00:07:48.723
<v Speaker 1>and some different characters might be </v>
<v Speaker 1>used to represent the different </v>

137
00:07:51.041 --> 00:07:51.874
<v Speaker 1>vocabulary and the order of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>characters might be different to </v>

138
00:07:54.281 --> 00:07:57.010
<v Speaker 1>represent the different syntax.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pronunciation,</v>

139
00:07:57.430 --> 00:08:00.250
<v Speaker 1>as previously mentioned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chinese languages are tonal.</v>

140
00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:01.113
<v Speaker 1>That means that tones are one part of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the pronunciation that can change the </v>

141
00:08:04.121 --> 00:08:04.954
<v Speaker 1>meaning of a word.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The same written word can be pronounced </v>

142
00:08:07.361 --> 00:08:09.550
<v Speaker 1>very differently in different Chinese </v>
<v Speaker 1>languages.</v>

143
00:08:09.700 --> 00:08:12.640
<v Speaker 1>This is the word for telephone first in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Mandarin,</v>

144
00:08:14.310 --> 00:08:18.370
<v Speaker 1>next in Cantonese in Wa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Shanghainese,</v>

145
00:08:20.030 --> 00:08:24.190
<v Speaker 1>and then Haka.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let me explain a little further.</v>

146
00:08:24.430 --> 00:08:28.060
<v Speaker 1>Mandarin has four main tones plus one </v>
<v Speaker 1>neutral tone.</v>

147
00:08:28.270 --> 00:08:33.100
<v Speaker 1>The tones are number one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a high flat tone to arising tone,</v>

148
00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:34.570
<v Speaker 1>three uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>falling.</v>

149
00:08:34.571 --> 00:08:37.930
<v Speaker 1>Rising tone for uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>falling tone and five,</v>

150
00:08:37.990 --> 00:08:38.823
<v Speaker 1>the neutral tone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning that syllable is not </v>

151
00:08:40.271 --> 00:08:41.650
<v Speaker 1>distinguished by tone at all.</v>

152
00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:44.360
<v Speaker 3>Ma Ma,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ma,</v>

153
00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:45.590
<v Speaker 3>Ma,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ma.</v>

154
00:08:46.610 --> 00:08:49.190
<v Speaker 1>Now Cantonese has six tones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The six cantor.</v>

155
00:08:49.191 --> 00:08:50.024
<v Speaker 1>These tones are number one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a high flat tone to amid rising tome </v>

156
00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:58.200
<v Speaker 1>three amid flat tone for a low falling </v>
<v Speaker 1>tone.</v>

157
00:08:58.470 --> 00:09:02.550
<v Speaker 1>Five a low rising tone and six a low </v>
<v Speaker 1>flat tone.</v>

158
00:09:03.050 --> 00:09:04.760
<v Speaker 4>Si,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Si,</v>

159
00:09:05.030 --> 00:09:06.710
<v Speaker 4>Si,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Si,</v>

160
00:09:07.010 --> 00:09:08.850
<v Speaker 4>Si,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Si.</v>

161
00:09:10.170 --> 00:09:13.170
<v Speaker 1>Shanghainese has a different type of </v>
<v Speaker 1>tone system entirely.</v>

162
00:09:13.380 --> 00:09:16.020
<v Speaker 1>It's more of a pitch accent system like </v>
<v Speaker 1>Japanese.</v>

163
00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:19.080
<v Speaker 1>There were really only two tones high </v>
<v Speaker 1>and low.</v>

164
00:09:19.350 --> 00:09:20.183
<v Speaker 1>At the tone of the first syllable </v>
<v Speaker 1>determines the tone pattern of the </v>

165
00:09:22.411 --> 00:09:25.440
<v Speaker 1>following syllables.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The you hear,</v>

166
00:09:25.441 --> 00:09:26.274
<v Speaker 1>the first syllable has a low tone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which depends on the character that </v>

167
00:09:29.281 --> 00:09:32.970
<v Speaker 1>makes the second syllable high and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't matter what character it is.</v>

168
00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:37.740
<v Speaker 1>Tone is only connected to meaning in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>first syllable word order.</v>

169
00:09:38.010 --> 00:09:41.100
<v Speaker 1>There are both similarities and </v>
<v Speaker 1>differences in the word order of Chinese</v>

170
00:09:41.101 --> 00:09:41.934
<v Speaker 1>languages.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mandarin is generally svo though it's </v>

171
00:09:44.521 --> 00:09:45.354
<v Speaker 1>Sov and some structures and Cantonese is</v>
<v Speaker 1>also Svo more so than member </v>

172
00:09:49.770 --> 00:09:53.580
<v Speaker 1>Shanghainese and other Wu dialects are </v>
<v Speaker 1>both Svo and Sov.</v>

173
00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:56.940
<v Speaker 1>So in Mandarin we have who?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Courtroom,</v>

174
00:09:57.420 --> 00:10:00.150
<v Speaker 1>which means I drink juice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's the subject,</v>

175
00:10:00.180 --> 00:10:03.210
<v Speaker 1>verb and object.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in Cantonese,</v>

176
00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:05.730
<v Speaker 1>all young goal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's up again,</v>

177
00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:06.593
<v Speaker 1>subject,</v>
<v Speaker 1>verb,</v>

178
00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:07.433
<v Speaker 1>object.</v>

179
00:10:07.620 --> 00:10:09.470
<v Speaker 1>And now in Shanghainese.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ooh,</v>

180
00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:10.313
<v Speaker 1>took in these examples,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it turns out that the word orders the </v>

181
00:10:13.111 --> 00:10:13.944
<v Speaker 1>same,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but notice that each language uses a </v>

182
00:10:15.391 --> 00:10:18.480
<v Speaker 1>different character for the verb to </v>
<v Speaker 1>reflect different vocabulary.</v>

183
00:10:18.750 --> 00:10:23.160
<v Speaker 1>Let's look at another element of word </v>
<v Speaker 1>order mandarin places an indirect object</v>

184
00:10:23.161 --> 00:10:23.994
<v Speaker 1>before the direct object.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cantonese places at after the direct </v>

185
00:10:26.761 --> 00:10:27.594
<v Speaker 1>object like in this sentence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which means give me the book in </v>

186
00:10:30.511 --> 00:10:32.310
<v Speaker 1>Mandarin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gay Weapons.</v>

187
00:10:33.150 --> 00:10:33.983
<v Speaker 1>So we're forward.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's give me book and in Cantonese bape </v>

188
00:10:37.281 --> 00:10:41.160
<v Speaker 1>and the single word for word,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's give book me and a few.</v>

189
00:10:41.161 --> 00:10:44.100
<v Speaker 1>Imagine a two in there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like give book to me.</v>

190
00:10:44.430 --> 00:10:45.263
<v Speaker 1>Also noticed the character for give is </v>
<v Speaker 1>different here and in Shanghainese oh </v>

191
00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:52.650
<v Speaker 1>bones hear the word order is like </v>
<v Speaker 1>mandarin,</v>

192
00:10:52.710 --> 00:10:56.970
<v Speaker 1>but notice the different word for give </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the variant character for me.</v>

193
00:10:57.690 --> 00:11:01.680
<v Speaker 1>Another example of difference mandarin </v>
<v Speaker 1>or standard Chinese places.</v>

194
00:11:01.681 --> 00:11:03.180
<v Speaker 1>The adverb before the verb.</v>

195
00:11:03.450 --> 00:11:06.360
<v Speaker 1>This sentence means I'll go first in </v>
<v Speaker 1>member in it,</v>

196
00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:08.670
<v Speaker 1>boy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>since all word for word,</v>

197
00:11:08.671 --> 00:11:11.700
<v Speaker 1>it's I first go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but Cantonese places,</v>

198
00:11:11.701 --> 00:11:15.330
<v Speaker 1>the adverb after the verb,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all it's llc work forward.</v>

199
00:11:15.331 --> 00:11:20.331
<v Speaker 1>It's I go first and in Shanghainese </v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll see about tele here.</v>

200
00:11:20.641 --> 00:11:21.474
<v Speaker 1>The main word order is the same as </v>
<v Speaker 1>mandarin with the advert before the </v>

201
00:11:24.091 --> 00:11:24.924
<v Speaker 1>verb,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but notice the additional particles at </v>

202
00:11:26.491 --> 00:11:29.730
<v Speaker 1>the end which are four exclamation but </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't have any core meaning.</v>

203
00:11:30.450 --> 00:11:32.850
<v Speaker 1>Another example difference mandarin </v>
<v Speaker 1>places,</v>

204
00:11:32.851 --> 00:11:33.684
<v Speaker 1>the adjective after the noun,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the phrase meaning strong wind in </v>

205
00:11:36.961 --> 00:11:37.794
<v Speaker 1>Mandarin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's literally when the strong from how </v>

206
00:11:41.220 --> 00:11:43.560
<v Speaker 1>Cantonese places the adjective before </v>
<v Speaker 1>the noun,</v>

207
00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:44.513
<v Speaker 1>so literally it's strong wind hold </v>
<v Speaker 1>iphone and in Shanghainese Fun loud to </v>

208
00:11:50.130 --> 00:11:53.290
<v Speaker 1>hear the adjective comes after the now </v>
<v Speaker 1>just like in Mandarin,</v>

209
00:11:53.530 --> 00:11:56.140
<v Speaker 1>but notice that one of the two </v>
<v Speaker 1>characters is different.</v>

210
00:11:57.010 --> 00:11:57.843
<v Speaker 1>Those are just a few samples of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>variation between the different Chinese </v>

211
00:12:00.581 --> 00:12:01.414
<v Speaker 1>languages and their dialects.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We could go very deeply into these </v>

212
00:12:03.701 --> 00:12:04.534
<v Speaker 1>differences,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's beyond the scope of this </v>

213
00:12:06.011 --> 00:12:06.970
<v Speaker 1>general video.</v>

214
00:12:09.050 --> 00:12:09.883
<v Speaker 1>One other difference we should talk </v>
<v Speaker 1>about though is that there are two </v>

215
00:12:11.721 --> 00:12:14.240
<v Speaker 1>different systems for writing Chinese </v>
<v Speaker 1>characters.</v>

216
00:12:14.360 --> 00:12:15.193
<v Speaker 1>There are traditional characters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ones that are written as they </v>

217
00:12:17.301 --> 00:12:18.134
<v Speaker 1>weren't in classical Chinese and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>there are simplified characters which </v>

218
00:12:21.051 --> 00:12:24.770
<v Speaker 1>were created in the 1950s and sixties to</v>
<v Speaker 1>increase literacy.</v>

219
00:12:24.890 --> 00:12:25.723
<v Speaker 1>Simplified characters are used in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>People's Republic of China and in </v>

220
00:12:28.431 --> 00:12:29.264
<v Speaker 1>Singapore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Traditional characters are used in </v>

221
00:12:30.861 --> 00:12:34.880
<v Speaker 1>Taiwan and in Hong Kong and Macau which </v>
<v Speaker 1>were not under Chinese rule.</v>

222
00:12:34.881 --> 00:12:36.890
<v Speaker 1>When simplified characters were </v>
<v Speaker 1>introduced.</v>

223
00:12:37.040 --> 00:12:39.980
<v Speaker 1>There are also used in many Chinese </v>
<v Speaker 1>diaspora communities.</v>

224
00:12:40.730 --> 00:12:43.530
<v Speaker 1>Here's the traditional character on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>left and here's that.</v>

225
00:12:43.531 --> 00:12:44.364
<v Speaker 1>Simplify the equivalent on the right so </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can see that they are different and </v>

226
00:12:47.211 --> 00:12:49.610
<v Speaker 1>it's probably easier to write the </v>
<v Speaker 1>simplified loan,</v>

227
00:12:49.880 --> 00:12:50.713
<v Speaker 1>but despite the differences,</v>
<v Speaker 1>literate native speakers generally have </v>

228
00:12:53.241 --> 00:12:55.460
<v Speaker 1>no trouble reading either type of </v>
<v Speaker 1>character.</v>

229
00:12:55.790 --> 00:12:58.040
<v Speaker 1>As you can see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the scientific language family,</v>

230
00:12:58.070 --> 00:12:58.903
<v Speaker 1>which is often called Chinese,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a large diverse group of languages </v>

231
00:13:01.701 --> 00:13:04.130
<v Speaker 1>and dialects which are often </v>
<v Speaker 1>unintelligible.</v>

232
00:13:04.340 --> 00:13:05.173
<v Speaker 1>What unites them all together is there </v>
<v Speaker 1>shared origin and growing out of middle </v>

233
00:13:08.391 --> 00:13:11.150
<v Speaker 1>Chinese and the classical Chinese </v>
<v Speaker 1>literary tradition,</v>

234
00:13:11.270 --> 00:13:12.103
<v Speaker 1>and there are also united by a common </v>
<v Speaker 1>written language which is learned and </v>

<v Speaker 1>understood by speakers of all Chinese </v>
<v Speaker 1>varieties.</v>

<v Speaker 1>even though speakers of different </v>

<v Speaker 1>with each other in writing,</v>

238

<v Speaker 1>that shared writing system isn't enough </v>
<v Speaker 1>to help them communicate verbally </v>

239
00:13:27.411 --> 00:13:28.244
<v Speaker 1>without specifically learning Mandarin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a good reason to consider </v>

240
00:13:30.951 --> 00:13:31.784
<v Speaker 1>Chinese a group of languages or a </v>
<v Speaker 1>language family rather than a single </v>

00:13:34.761 --> 00:13:35.594

242
00:13:38.121 --> 00:13:42.200

<v Speaker 1>Do you consider Chinese to be a group of</v>

243
00:13:42.201 --> 00:13:43.034
<v Speaker 1>distinct languages or do you consider it</v>
<v Speaker 1>one language with a lot of dialectal </v>

244
00:13:46.401 --> 00:13:47.234
<v Speaker 1>variation?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm just asking you to explain the </v>

245
00:13:48.921 --> 00:13:49.754
<v Speaker 1>way that you personally think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's no right or wrong answer </v>

<v Speaker 1>here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And for people who have studied any </v>
