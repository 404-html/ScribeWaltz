00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.080
<v Speaker 1>Hello everyone and welcome to the lange </v>
<v Speaker 1>focus channel.</v>

5
00:00:10.081 --> 00:00:10.914
<v Speaker 1>My name is Paul.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Today I am going to talk about the </v>

6
00:00:12.781 --> 00:00:15.090
<v Speaker 1>Spanish language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As you may know,</v>

7
00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:18.150
<v Speaker 1>Spain has more than one language,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so when I say Spanish,</v>

8
00:00:18.151 --> 00:00:20.790
<v Speaker 1>I'm referring specifically to Castilian </v>
<v Speaker 1>Spanish,</v>

9
00:00:20.791 --> 00:00:21.624
<v Speaker 1>which is spoken as a native language by </v>
<v Speaker 1>74% of the people of Spain and 99% of </v>

10
00:00:26.461 --> 00:00:29.040
<v Speaker 1>the people of span including second </v>
<v Speaker 1>language speaker.</v>

11
00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.510
<v Speaker 1>Castilian is the Spanish language that </v>
<v Speaker 1>grew to become one of the most important</v>

12
00:00:33.511 --> 00:00:34.344
<v Speaker 1>global languages during this video.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I might refer to it as Castilian to </v>

13
00:00:37.771 --> 00:00:39.960
<v Speaker 1>contrast it with other languages of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Spain,</v>

14
00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.430
<v Speaker 1>but usually I'll refer to it as Spanish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Out of all languages in the world,</v>

15
00:00:44.431 --> 00:00:45.264
<v Speaker 1>Spanish has the second largest number of</v>
<v Speaker 1>native speakers with 470 million native </v>

16
00:00:49.471 --> 00:00:53.670
<v Speaker 1>speakers as well as another 90 million </v>
<v Speaker 1>who speak it as a second language.</v>

17
00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.050
<v Speaker 1>It is also one of the most widely </v>
<v Speaker 1>dispersed languages with 44 countries of</v>

18
00:00:58.051 --> 00:01:01.620
<v Speaker 1>the world having at least 3 million </v>
<v Speaker 1>native speakers of Spanish or more.</v>

19
00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:02.693
<v Speaker 1>It is one of the six official languages </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the UN as well as an official </v>

20
00:01:05.491 --> 00:01:06.324
<v Speaker 1>language of the European Union.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is also an official language of 21 </v>

21
00:01:09.811 --> 00:01:11.760
<v Speaker 1>countries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we include Puerto Rico,</v>

22
00:01:11.761 --> 00:01:12.594
<v Speaker 1>which is a territory of the US.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It also used to be an official language </v>

23
00:01:16.051 --> 00:01:18.370
<v Speaker 1>of the Philippines,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it is not any more.</v>

24
00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.830
<v Speaker 1>Spanish is also the third most widely </v>
<v Speaker 1>used language on the Internet.</v>

25
00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.810
<v Speaker 1>According to one source that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>consulted,</v>

26
00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.040
<v Speaker 1>the use of Spanish online has grown by </v>
<v Speaker 1>800% in the past few years.</v>

27
00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:30.123
<v Speaker 1>Spanish is a member of the Barrow </v>
<v Speaker 1>Romance Subfamily of the Romance </v>

28
00:01:33.031 --> 00:01:36.360
<v Speaker 1>Language family.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Other members of that sub family include</v>

29
00:01:36.361 --> 00:01:39.290
<v Speaker 1>Portuguese galicians and some people say</v>
<v Speaker 1>Katelyn,</v>

30
00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:43.110
<v Speaker 1>like all romance languages.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Spanish developed from Vulgar Latin,</v>

31
00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.560
<v Speaker 1>the spoken Latin that was brought to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>area by the Roman Empire.</v>

32
00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:47.573
<v Speaker 1>Vulgar Latin evolved into numerous </v>
<v Speaker 1>regional dialects which eventually </v>

33
00:01:50.431 --> 00:01:53.460
<v Speaker 1>became distinct enough to be considered </v>
<v Speaker 1>different languages.</v>

34
00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:54.533
<v Speaker 1>There are documents from the ninth </v>
<v Speaker 1>century that are written in an early </v>

35
00:01:56.731 --> 00:02:01.170
<v Speaker 1>form of Castilian Spanish or we could </v>
<v Speaker 1>say a late form of vulgar Latin.</v>

36
00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:02.363
<v Speaker 1>In any case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>documents like these show that the </v>

37
00:02:03.691 --> 00:02:06.660
<v Speaker 1>vulgar Latin dialects were becoming </v>
<v Speaker 1>separate languages.</v>

38
00:02:06.661 --> 00:02:07.494
<v Speaker 1>By that point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Castilian Spanish is the language that </v>

39
00:02:09.301 --> 00:02:10.134
<v Speaker 1>our role is in the north central region </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the Berrien Peninsula called Castiel </v>

40
00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.860
<v Speaker 1>and it grew more and more distinct from </v>
<v Speaker 1>its neighbor language Leo needs.</v>

41
00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:18.083
<v Speaker 1>It became firmly established as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>distinct language in the 13th century </v>

42
00:02:21.271 --> 00:02:22.104
<v Speaker 1>when King I'll funds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh decided to standardize the written </v>

43
00:02:24.001 --> 00:02:28.050
<v Speaker 1>language for official use based on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>dialect spoken in Toledo.</v>

44
00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:29.123
<v Speaker 1>It process,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which continued for a few hundred years </v>

45
00:02:30.721 --> 00:02:31.554
<v Speaker 1>until the 16th century in the 13 </v>
<v Speaker 1>hundreds of the southern part of the </v>

46
00:02:34.681 --> 00:02:35.514
<v Speaker 1>Iberian peninsula was under the control </v>
<v Speaker 1>of al and the loose a Muslim controlled </v>

47
00:02:38.671 --> 00:02:42.960
<v Speaker 1>territory that had previously controlled</v>
<v Speaker 1>most of the peninsula that Econ Kista,</v>

48
00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:43.853
<v Speaker 1>which means the reconquest resulted in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the retaking of the Muslim areas and of </v>

49
00:02:47.791 --> 00:02:50.280
<v Speaker 1>the spread of Castilian Spanish to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>south.</v>

50
00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:53.040
<v Speaker 1>There it was influenced by the most </v>
<v Speaker 1>Arabic dialects.</v>

51
00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:57.540
<v Speaker 1>Those were romanced dialects spoken by </v>
<v Speaker 1>Muslims in Alanda loose that contained a</v>

52
00:02:57.541 --> 00:02:58.374
<v Speaker 1>lot of loan words from Arabic castilian </v>
<v Speaker 1>Spanish absorbed a lot of those Arabic </v>

53
00:03:01.841 --> 00:03:02.674
<v Speaker 1>loan words up to 4,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>words or 8% of the modern languages </v>

54
00:03:05.921 --> 00:03:06.754
<v Speaker 1>vocabulary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some common Spanish words of Arabic </v>

55
00:03:08.531 --> 00:03:09.364
<v Speaker 1>origin are Asda,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which means until that comes from the </v>

56
00:03:12.461 --> 00:03:15.850
<v Speaker 1>Arabic word Hata with the same meaning </v>
<v Speaker 1>or law,</v>

57
00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.620
<v Speaker 1>which means I hope comes from the Arabic</v>
<v Speaker 1>word low shalla or in Shell law,</v>

58
00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:23.260
<v Speaker 1>which means if it's God's will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a set day,</v>

59
00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:27.910
<v Speaker 1>which means oil as in olive oil comes </v>
<v Speaker 1>from the Arabic word as it with the same</v>

60
00:03:27.911 --> 00:03:28.744
<v Speaker 1>meaning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There were also a lot of words in </v>

61
00:03:29.651 --> 00:03:34.000
<v Speaker 1>Spanish that begin with Aal out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the Arabic definite article.</v>

62
00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:37.480
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>alcohol from the Arabic word alcohol,</v>

63
00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:40.560
<v Speaker 1>which of course means alcohol and </v>
<v Speaker 1>alcohol day,</v>

64
00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:43.050
<v Speaker 1>which means mayor comes from the Arabic </v>
<v Speaker 1>word,</v>

65
00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:45.790
<v Speaker 1>alcohol d,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which means judge in Arabic.</v>

66
00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:46.923
<v Speaker 1>That's just a couple of examples,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there are lots of words beginning </v>

67
00:03:48.941 --> 00:03:49.774
<v Speaker 1>with AOL in Spanish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Christian reconquest of the South </v>

68
00:03:52.511 --> 00:03:55.900
<v Speaker 1>successfully ended in 1492 and that very</v>
<v Speaker 1>same year,</v>

69
00:03:55.901 --> 00:03:59.680
<v Speaker 1>Spain began sending explorers like </v>
<v Speaker 1>Christopher Columbus abroad to build the</v>

70
00:03:59.681 --> 00:04:00.514
<v Speaker 1>Spanish empire,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Spanish language spread along with </v>

71
00:04:02.561 --> 00:04:05.740
<v Speaker 1>the Empire to the Americas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the Spanish east indies,</v>

72
00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:09.070
<v Speaker 1>which includes present day Philippines </v>
<v Speaker 1>and to some parts of Africa.</v>

73
00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:11.320
<v Speaker 1>One area it spread to us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mexico,</v>

74
00:04:11.321 --> 00:04:12.154
<v Speaker 1>which today has the largest Spanish </v>
<v Speaker 1>speaking population of any country with </v>

75
00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:15.813
<v Speaker 1>120 million speakers of Spanish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The variety of Spanish spoken in Mexico </v>

76
00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:20.523
<v Speaker 1>varies somewhat from the variety spoken </v>
<v Speaker 1>in Spain and that's true for the other </v>

77
00:04:23.831 --> 00:04:24.664
<v Speaker 1>Spanish speaking countries as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The standard written language is </v>

78
00:04:27.131 --> 00:04:27.964
<v Speaker 1>basically the same everywhere,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the spoken language has some </v>

79
00:04:30.011 --> 00:04:30.844
<v Speaker 1>differences,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially in pronunciation and in </v>

80
00:04:32.741 --> 00:04:37.060
<v Speaker 1>vocabulary and especially in common </v>
<v Speaker 1>daily vocabulary like clothing,</v>

81
00:04:37.061 --> 00:04:38.380
<v Speaker 1>food and things like that.</v>

82
00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:39.393
<v Speaker 1>In Latin America,</v>
<v Speaker 1>various native languages influenced the </v>

83
00:04:41.591 --> 00:04:42.424
<v Speaker 1>different local varieties of Spanish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's the best variety of Spanish to </v>

84
00:04:45.341 --> 00:04:46.270
<v Speaker 1>learn?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

85
00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:48.790
<v Speaker 1>the varieties are often categorized into</v>
<v Speaker 1>European,</v>

86
00:04:48.791 --> 00:04:52.300
<v Speaker 1>Spanish and Latin American Spanish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>From what I understand,</v>

87
00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:54.640
<v Speaker 1>there isn't a lot of difference for </v>
<v Speaker 1>beginners.</v>

88
00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:55.773
<v Speaker 1>No matter which variety you'll learn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you will be able to adapt to other </v>

89
00:04:58.301 --> 00:05:00.670
<v Speaker 1>varieties quite easily.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Personally,</v>

90
00:05:00.671 --> 00:05:04.070
<v Speaker 1>I've met more Spanish speakers from </v>
<v Speaker 1>Mexico than from any other country.</v>

91
00:05:04.071 --> 00:05:04.904
<v Speaker 1>So for me that's the natural choice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But for you it depends on which variety </v>

92
00:05:08.351 --> 00:05:11.470
<v Speaker 1>you are most likely to use and which one</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're most interested in.</v>

93
00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:12.903
<v Speaker 1>Like romance languages in general,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Spanish shares a lot of vocabulary with </v>

94
00:05:15.821 --> 00:05:17.860
<v Speaker 1>English,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not identical vocabulary,</v>

95
00:05:17.861 --> 00:05:18.694
<v Speaker 1>but related vocabulary that you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>figure out and you can more easily </v>

96
00:05:21.881 --> 00:05:25.270
<v Speaker 1>remember if you associate it with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>related English words.</v>

97
00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:27.430
<v Speaker 1>Let's take a look at a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 1>sentences.</v>

98
00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:31.030
<v Speaker 1>Cuanto Cuesta when via Nueva York.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

99
00:05:31.031 --> 00:05:34.120
<v Speaker 1>so the first word Quanto that sounds to </v>
<v Speaker 1>me like quantity.</v>

100
00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:37.060
<v Speaker 1>So I think it means how much because </v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a question.</v>

101
00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:39.100
<v Speaker 1>The next word,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cuesta.</v>

102
00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:41.530
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that probably means cost.</v>

103
00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:43.710
<v Speaker 1>The next word I know that means,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>

104
00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:46.140
<v Speaker 1>the indefinite article,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the next word via.</v>

105
00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:50.080
<v Speaker 1>Well that looks like voyage to me or </v>
<v Speaker 1>voyage in French.</v>

106
00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:53.800
<v Speaker 1>So I think it means a voyage or a trip.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I know means to,</v>

107
00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:55.810
<v Speaker 1>and Nueva York,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>

108
00:05:55.811 --> 00:05:59.360
<v Speaker 1>that means New York.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think means how much does a trip to</v>

109
00:05:59.361 --> 00:06:01.790
<v Speaker 1>New York costs if we translate it </v>
<v Speaker 1>literally,</v>

110
00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:02.983
<v Speaker 1>how much costs a trip to New York.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Another sentence [inaudible] to say no </v>

111
00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:11.840
<v Speaker 1>to movies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's look at it word by word L.</v>

112
00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:14.820
<v Speaker 1>I know that means the definite article </v>
<v Speaker 1>on bread.</v>

113
00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:16.910
<v Speaker 1>That's a word I know from movies and </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>

114
00:06:16.911 --> 00:06:20.270
<v Speaker 1>I think that means if men come to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

115
00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:22.460
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's come back to that one in a second.</v>

116
00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:22.800
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible]</v>

117
00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:26.540
<v Speaker 1>is up and I would do movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That means automobile car.</v>

118
00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:30.560
<v Speaker 1>So go back to come to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well maybe that means conduct.</v>

119
00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:33.230
<v Speaker 1>Or in this case you don't conduct an </v>
<v Speaker 1>automobile,</v>

120
00:06:33.231 --> 00:06:34.064
<v Speaker 1>you drive an automobile.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this means the man drives an </v>

121
00:06:36.711 --> 00:06:39.860
<v Speaker 1>automobile or demand drives a car.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you can see that.</v>

122
00:06:39.861 --> 00:06:41.750
<v Speaker 1>You can figure out what those words </v>
<v Speaker 1>mean.</v>

123
00:06:41.751 --> 00:06:43.700
<v Speaker 1>If you look at each word and analyze </v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

124
00:06:43.701 --> 00:06:46.280
<v Speaker 1>It's not always that easy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's an easy example.</v>

125
00:06:46.281 --> 00:06:47.114
<v Speaker 1>So you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And also if we look at the syntax of </v>

126
00:06:49.071 --> 00:06:49.904
<v Speaker 1>those sentences,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can see that they're very similar to </v>

127
00:06:51.231 --> 00:06:53.090
<v Speaker 1>English.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the first sentence again,</v>

128
00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:56.010
<v Speaker 1>Quanto Questa in via a on Nueva York.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

129
00:06:56.120 --> 00:07:00.470
<v Speaker 1>so how much costs a trip to New York?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So quite similar to English,</v>

130
00:07:00.471 --> 00:07:03.110
<v Speaker 1>but just sort of simplified the next </v>
<v Speaker 1>sentence.</v>

131
00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:07.550
<v Speaker 1>The man drives a car.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That one is word by word,</v>

132
00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:09.170
<v Speaker 1>exactly the same as English.</v>

133
00:07:09.170 --> 00:07:10.003
<v Speaker 1>So it's translatable directly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course the grammar gets more </v>

134
00:07:12.561 --> 00:07:13.394
<v Speaker 1>complicated than that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But just the most basic syntax is very </v>

135
00:07:15.651 --> 00:07:16.484
<v Speaker 1>similar to English.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this is one of the benefits of </v>

136
00:07:18.471 --> 00:07:20.870
<v Speaker 1>learning a romance language for English </v>
<v Speaker 1>speakers.</v>

137
00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:23.540
<v Speaker 1>According to the American Foreign </v>
<v Speaker 1>Service Institute,</v>

138
00:07:23.541 --> 00:07:27.950
<v Speaker 1>Spanish is a category one language that </v>
<v Speaker 1>means that relatively speaking it is one</v>

139
00:07:27.951 --> 00:07:30.650
<v Speaker 1>of the easier languages for native </v>
<v Speaker 1>English speakers to learn.</v>

140
00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:31.813
<v Speaker 1>So what are you waiting for and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>some Spaniel or should I say </v>

141
00:07:34.550 --> 00:07:35.383
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible]?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure because Spanish speakers </v>

142
00:07:37.431 --> 00:07:39.500
<v Speaker 1>themselves can't actually agree on this </v>
<v Speaker 1>issue.</v>

143
00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:43.120
<v Speaker 1>In the red colored countries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the preferred term is custody ended,</v>

144
00:07:43.130 --> 00:07:45.800
<v Speaker 1>the blue colored countries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the preferred term is espanol.</v>

145
00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:46.993
<v Speaker 1>And in Spain you can see that there is </v>
<v Speaker 1>some disagreement about which term is </v>

146
00:07:49.611 --> 00:07:52.490
<v Speaker 1>best.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're a native speaker of Spanish,</v>

147
00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:53.353
<v Speaker 1>maybe you can tell us what you think </v>
<v Speaker 1>about that in the comments down below </v>

148
00:07:56.150 --> 00:07:58.340
<v Speaker 1>and other people you can leave your </v>
<v Speaker 1>comments to.</v>

149
00:07:58.490 --> 00:08:00.950
<v Speaker 1>Thank you for watching.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have a nice day.</v>
