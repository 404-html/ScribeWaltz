<v Speaker 1>Hello Youtube artificial intelligence </v>
<v Speaker 1>bots.</v>

2
00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:07.020
<v Speaker 1>Please don't demonetize me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This video has nothing to do with brexit</v>

3
00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:10.560
<v Speaker 1>and there's absolutely nothing offensive</v>
<v Speaker 1>about the word cockney.</v>

4
00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.420
<v Speaker 1>Today I want to examine a unique and </v>
<v Speaker 1>extremely creative form of English slang</v>

5
00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:16.283
<v Speaker 1>called cockney rhyming slang.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cockneys are traditionally defined as </v>

6
00:00:19.201 --> 00:00:20.034
<v Speaker 1>people living within earshot of the bow </v>
<v Speaker 1>bells of the Saint Marie Leveaux church </v>

7
00:00:23.581 --> 00:00:24.414
<v Speaker 1>in the east end of London,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the term cockney has come to refer </v>

8
00:00:27.031 --> 00:00:31.230
<v Speaker 1>to working class Londoners in various </v>
<v Speaker 1>parts of the city and surrounding areas.</v>

9
00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:32.303
<v Speaker 1>Cockney rhyming slang was first </v>
<v Speaker 1>mentioned in a book published in 1859 </v>

10
00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.560
<v Speaker 1>and had probably begun to be used in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>1840s so what the heck is it?</v>

11
00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:41.513
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll give you the most basic and cliche </v>

12
00:00:43.111 --> 00:00:44.910
<v Speaker 1>example of cockney rhyming slang.</v>

13
00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.120
<v Speaker 2>I went up the Alpha one Perez,</v>

14
00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.180
<v Speaker 1>the phrase apples and pears is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>substitute for the word stairs.</v>

15
00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:52.193
<v Speaker 1>So you take a word that rhymes with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>original word and then use it to create </v>

16
00:00:55.561 --> 00:00:56.394
<v Speaker 1>a pair of related words.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That pair of words now represents the </v>

17
00:00:59.131 --> 00:01:02.910
<v Speaker 1>original word in this case stairs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's the most interesting part.</v>

18
00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:03.803
<v Speaker 1>The second word of the pear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the one that rhymes with the original </v>

19
00:01:06.151 --> 00:01:09.780
<v Speaker 1>word is usually left out as in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went up the apples,</v>

20
00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:12.120
<v Speaker 1>but how are you supposed to know what it</v>
<v Speaker 1>means?</v>

21
00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:13.133
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>originally this kind of slang was not </v>

22
00:01:14.431 --> 00:01:15.264
<v Speaker 1>meant to be understood by everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was created by street merchants and </v>

23
00:01:18.331 --> 00:01:21.810
<v Speaker 1>criminals in order to prevent other </v>
<v Speaker 1>people from understanding what they were</v>

24
00:01:21.811 --> 00:01:22.644
<v Speaker 1>talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it soon became a colorful form of </v>

25
00:01:24.751 --> 00:01:27.420
<v Speaker 1>expression rather than just covert </v>
<v Speaker 1>communication.</v>

26
00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:29.790
<v Speaker 1>Let's look at some more classic </v>
<v Speaker 1>examples.</v>

27
00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:30.683
<v Speaker 1>We'll start with the word house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A rhyming word is mouse a complimentary </v>

28
00:01:34.501 --> 00:01:38.100
<v Speaker 1>where it is cat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So cat and mouse means house.</v>

29
00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:41.450
<v Speaker 2>I went inside the canton mass and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>apple and pears,</v>

30
00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:45.590
<v Speaker 1>theoretically possible to shorten both </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the rhymes and say the sentence,</v>

31
00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:47.890
<v Speaker 2>I went inside the car and up the air </v>
<v Speaker 2>force.</v>

32
00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:51.740
<v Speaker 1>But it would probably be said the long </v>
<v Speaker 1>wait in order to be less confusing.</v>

33
00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:54.890
<v Speaker 1>Here's another example using an animal </v>
<v Speaker 1>word.</v>

34
00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:58.100
<v Speaker 1>The original word is phone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Phone rhymes with bone.</v>

35
00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:00.530
<v Speaker 1>What animals are normally associated </v>
<v Speaker 1>with bones.</v>

36
00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:03.470
<v Speaker 1>Dogs of course.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So dog and bone means a phone.</v>

37
00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:05.770
<v Speaker 1>So there's this sentence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pause this.</v>

38
00:02:05.771 --> 00:02:09.020
<v Speaker 1>The dog meaning passed me the phone in </v>
<v Speaker 1>cockney speech,</v>

39
00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.883
<v Speaker 1>sometimes the plural pronoun us can be </v>
<v Speaker 1>used with the singular meaning instead </v>

40
00:02:13.431 --> 00:02:17.300
<v Speaker 1>of me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's one more sort of household object</v>

41
00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:20.330
<v Speaker 1>freezer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A rhyming pair is Mona Lisa.</v>

42
00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:22.970
<v Speaker 1>Notice here that in my North American </v>
<v Speaker 1>accent,</v>

43
00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:23.923
<v Speaker 1>Lisa and freezer don't run,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the cockney dialect and most </v>

44
00:02:27.141 --> 00:02:31.250
<v Speaker 1>dialects of England or non Roddick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning that the are consonants are only</v>

45
00:02:31.251 --> 00:02:32.084
<v Speaker 1>pronounced before.</v>
