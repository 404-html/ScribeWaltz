00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:01.293
<v Speaker 1>Hello everyone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>welcome to the Lange Focus Channel and </v>

2
00:00:03.371 --> 00:00:08.371
<v Speaker 1>my name is Paul and welcome to another </v>
<v Speaker 1>edition of mystery languages.</v>

3
00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:11.560
<v Speaker 1>If this is your first time watching a </v>
<v Speaker 1>mystery languages video,</v>

4
00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:12.443
<v Speaker 1>they'd let me tell you how it goes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll play you a sample of a language or </v>

5
00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:16.173
<v Speaker 1>a couple of samples of a language and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can listen and guess what each </v>

6
00:00:18.881 --> 00:00:22.270
<v Speaker 1>language might be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You might not get the exact language,</v>

7
00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:25.750
<v Speaker 1>but you might get the region or the </v>
<v Speaker 1>language family or something like that,</v>

8
00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:26.613
<v Speaker 1>and that's a partial success in itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Today's language samples were submitted </v>

9
00:00:29.801 --> 00:00:30.634
<v Speaker 1>by Lang focus viewers via instagram,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'm especially excited about today's </v>

10
00:00:34.091 --> 00:00:36.790
<v Speaker 1>episode,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so let's get started.</v>

11
00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:38.610
<v Speaker 2>Please listen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

12
00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:39.453
<v Speaker 2>some of upper management Snow Heidi,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who never came in Kakapo cookie bites </v>

13
00:00:46.851 --> 00:00:50.300
<v Speaker 2>one year ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Has that thought about tune on united.</v>

14
00:00:50.301 --> 00:00:53.630
<v Speaker 2>I live Aristo covered cocky,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mucin,</v>

15
00:00:53.631 --> 00:00:57.230
<v Speaker 2>and lookup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's a good had not hired?</v>

16
00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:01.420
<v Speaker 1>Now let's look at a few samples with </v>
<v Speaker 1>writing.</v>

17
00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:04.750
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The gunnel mechanic authority boost.</v>

18
00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:09.830
<v Speaker 2>Not good care there today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

19
00:01:09.831 --> 00:01:10.641
<v Speaker 2>Chimp,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Joshy,</v>

20
00:01:10.641 --> 00:01:11.660
<v Speaker 2>ICA echo.</v>

21
00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:14.740
<v Speaker 1>So what language do you think it might </v>
<v Speaker 1>be?</v>

22
00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:26.100
<v Speaker 1>The language is Armenian.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Armenian is the official language of the</v>

23
00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:27.693
<v Speaker 1>Republic of Armenia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but more than half of it speakers live </v>

24
00:01:29.141 --> 00:01:31.870
<v Speaker 1>in other countries in Armenian minority </v>
<v Speaker 1>communities.</v>

25
00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:35.320
<v Speaker 1>It's a member of the Indo European </v>
<v Speaker 1>language family,</v>

26
00:01:35.321 --> 00:01:36.154
<v Speaker 1>but it forms its own branch of Indo </v>
<v Speaker 1>European because it's linked to other </v>

27
00:01:39.161 --> 00:01:41.170
<v Speaker 1>languages in the family are not really </v>
<v Speaker 1>known,</v>

28
00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:44.830
<v Speaker 1>but it has borrowed a large amount of </v>
<v Speaker 1>vocabulary from Persian,</v>

29
00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:48.040
<v Speaker 1>so Persian speakers might recognize a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of words in Armenian.</v>

30
00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:52.060
<v Speaker 1>The stress and Armenian generally falls </v>
<v Speaker 1>on the final syllable of the word.</v>

31
00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:53.920
<v Speaker 1>Not always,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it usually does,</v>

32
00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:57.910
<v Speaker 1>unless the word has the definite article</v>
<v Speaker 1>or a possessive adjective at the end.</v>

33
00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:01.200
<v Speaker 1>If we read along with the sentences we </v>
<v Speaker 1>heard before,</v>

34
00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:03.810
<v Speaker 1>we can notice that the stress usually </v>
<v Speaker 1>comes at the end.</v>

35
00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:06.100
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mechanic authority.</v>

36
00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:06.953
<v Speaker 2>How boost</v>

37
00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:08.063
<v Speaker 1>on this recording this word sounds like </v>
<v Speaker 1>it has the stress on the first syllable </v>

38
00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:14.640
<v Speaker 1>like Connie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in other sources it sounds more like</v>

39
00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:16.890
<v Speaker 1>Connie with the stress on the second </v>
<v Speaker 1>syllable.</v>

40
00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:21.860
<v Speaker 1>That might depend on the sentence level.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stress of the sentence as a whole.</v>

41
00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:23.780
<v Speaker 2>Not Good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kevin,</v>

42
00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:26.120
<v Speaker 2>today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

43
00:02:26.121 --> 00:02:26.950
<v Speaker 2>Chimp,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Joshy,</v>

44
00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:27.783
<v Speaker 2>ICA.</v>

45
00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:32.240
<v Speaker 1>There are two standard varieties of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Armenian western Armenian,</v>

46
00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:35.390
<v Speaker 1>eastern Armenian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which have some significant differences.</v>

47
00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:38.900
<v Speaker 1>The variety that you heard in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>samples was eastern Armenian.</v>

48
00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:40.003
<v Speaker 1>This map shows the distribution of </v>
<v Speaker 1>western Armenian and eastern Armenian </v>

49
00:02:43.011 --> 00:02:45.470
<v Speaker 1>dialects at the beginning of the 20th </v>
<v Speaker 1>century,</v>

50
00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:49.580
<v Speaker 1>but most speakers of western Armenian </v>
<v Speaker 1>now live in diaspora communities.</v>

51
00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:51.800
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now onto the next language.</v>

52
00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:53.400
<v Speaker 1>Please listen night.</v>

53
00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:58.310
<v Speaker 3>Mr.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mr Wyangela on where I'm going to say.</v>

54
00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:59.220
<v Speaker 3>Let's see.</v>

<v Speaker 3>worn out.</v>

56
00:03:00.381 --> 00:03:02.720
<v Speaker 3>I don't plan on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We don't know.</v>

57
00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:07.460
<v Speaker 3>We're flying night.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Galileo Galilei Pitney's only leak Amman</v>

58
00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:11.550
<v Speaker 3>at Tennessee Pitney.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pitney Barlett beating the bottle.</v>

59
00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:14.760
<v Speaker 3>All of us are not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Are polycystic comfy together.</v>

60
00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:19.020
<v Speaker 3>Amman,</v>

61
00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:20.970
<v Speaker 3>I mean not in good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tal.</v>

62
00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:22.720
<v Speaker 3>Why then?</v>
<v Speaker 3>People are really,</v>

63
00:03:22.721 --> 00:03:23.554
<v Speaker 3>really wicked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not.</v>

64
00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:24.483
<v Speaker 3>Tell going,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tell about why Sarafina Pitney Garden </v>

65
00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:31.613
<v Speaker 3>Wall.</v>

66
00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:34.160
<v Speaker 1>Now let's look at a few more sentences </v>
<v Speaker 1>with writing.</v>

67
00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:36.540
<v Speaker 3>Meanwhile,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm buying some clothes.</v>

68
00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:40.110
<v Speaker 3>She borrowed the book from the library.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Me.</v>

69
00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:41.950
<v Speaker 3>Now I'm going on tonight,</v>

70
00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:44.140
<v Speaker 1>so what language could it be?</v>

71
00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:50.500
<v Speaker 4>Cool.</v>

72
00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:54.130
<v Speaker 1>The language is Jamaican Patois,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as the name suggests.</v>

73
00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:54.993
<v Speaker 1>Jamaican Patois is spoken in Jamaica.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has around $3 million native </v>

74
00:03:58.121 --> 00:03:58.954
<v Speaker 1>speakers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an English based creole that </v>

75
00:04:00.581 --> 00:04:01.414
<v Speaker 1>developed in the 17th and 18th centuries</v>
<v Speaker 1>through contact between African slaves </v>

76
00:04:05.231 --> 00:04:06.064
<v Speaker 1>and English speaking slave owners.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The official language of Jamaica is </v>

77
00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:09.603
<v Speaker 1>English and Jamaican.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Patois is spoken on a continuum with </v>

78
00:04:12.371 --> 00:04:13.204
<v Speaker 1>standard Jamaican English.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That means that in some situations </v>

79
00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:16.353
<v Speaker 1>speakers will be essentially using </v>
<v Speaker 1>standard English with a characteristic </v>

80
00:04:19.391 --> 00:04:20.830
<v Speaker 1>Jamaican accent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

81
00:04:20.831 --> 00:04:21.664
<v Speaker 1>in other situations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>speakers will mix English with varying </v>

82
00:04:23.981 --> 00:04:27.280
<v Speaker 1>degrees of Patois and at the very casual</v>
<v Speaker 1>end of the spectrum,</v>

83
00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:30.130
<v Speaker 1>speakers might use Jamaican patois </v>
<v Speaker 1>exclusively.</v>

84
00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:32.590
<v Speaker 1>The three sentences that we saw on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>screen,</v>

85
00:04:32.591 --> 00:04:33.424
<v Speaker 1>we're pretty close to standard English,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the longer reading that you heard </v>

86
00:04:36.011 --> 00:04:36.844
<v Speaker 1>was full on Jamaican Patois,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we do see some grammatical and </v>

87
00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:41.860
<v Speaker 1>phonological changes in those three </v>
<v Speaker 1>sentences.</v>

88
00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:43.420
<v Speaker 1>Take the third one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For instance,</v>

89
00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:45.720
<v Speaker 3>now I'm going on tonight.</v>

90
00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:51.020
<v Speaker 1>Jamaican patois uses me as the subject </v>
<v Speaker 1>pronouns rather than the negative is now</v>

91
00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:52.493
<v Speaker 1>instead of not and noticed that there is</v>
<v Speaker 1>a double negative with no being used </v>

92
00:04:55.981 --> 00:04:56.814
<v Speaker 1>where any would be used in English.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Notice that going to is abbreviated to </v>

93
00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:01.123
<v Speaker 1>go on and of course the pronunciation is</v>
<v Speaker 1>different to Dina and tonight are close </v>

94
00:05:05.401 --> 00:05:06.234
<v Speaker 1>to the standard English equivalents just</v>
<v Speaker 1>with slightly different pronunciation </v>

95
00:05:08.701 --> 00:05:12.180
<v Speaker 1>and spelling to match and onto the next </v>
<v Speaker 1>language.</v>

96
00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:13.103
<v Speaker 1>Please listen.</v>

97
00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:19.580
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we at the illegal hit on my eggs.</v>

98
00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:28.990
<v Speaker 5>Salmon on your Buddha,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Allah Aleda a late hit our,</v>

99
00:05:31.241 --> 00:05:36.241
<v Speaker 5>let's say a Nicholean household in order</v>
<v Speaker 5>to Arizona.</v>

100
00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:39.403
<v Speaker 5>So</v>

101
00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:44.310
<v Speaker 1>next we'll look at a few sentences with </v>
<v Speaker 1>writing.</v>

102
00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:45.463
<v Speaker 5>I do.</v>

103
00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:48.850
<v Speaker 1>Hi.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm able to take away.</v>

104
00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:51.030
<v Speaker 1>That's in the morning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We had AP.</v>

105
00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:54.440
<v Speaker 1>So what language could this possibly be?</v>

106
00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:05.600
<v Speaker 1>The language is what our need is an </v>
<v Speaker 1>indigenous language of South America.</v>

107
00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:06.493
<v Speaker 1>It's spoken by over 6 million people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>including most of the population of </v>

108
00:06:09.621 --> 00:06:10.454
<v Speaker 1>Paraguay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where it's an official language </v>

109
00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:15.110
<v Speaker 1>alongside Spanish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's also spoken in parts of neighboring</v>

110
00:06:15.111 --> 00:06:16.460
<v Speaker 1>Argentina,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bolivia,</v>

111
00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:17.353
<v Speaker 1>and Brazil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a member of the Tupi language </v>

112
00:06:19.311 --> 00:06:20.144
<v Speaker 1>family,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which consists of around 70 languages </v>

113
00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:22.993
<v Speaker 1>scattered throughout South America.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One feature of gluttony that we can </v>

114
00:06:25.791 --> 00:06:30.620
<v Speaker 1>notice is that every syllable consists </v>
<v Speaker 1>of a consonant plus a vowel or a vowel.</v>

115
00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:34.970
<v Speaker 1>A syllable cannot end in a consonant and</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are no consonant clusters.</v>

116
00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:36.043
<v Speaker 1>To me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this gives the language a pleasant </v>

117
00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:39.590
<v Speaker 1>light,</v>
<v Speaker 1>floating quality kind of sing song me,</v>

118
00:06:39.591 --> 00:06:40.424
<v Speaker 1>but without tones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Another thing that adds to this quality </v>

119
00:06:42.921 --> 00:06:44.630
<v Speaker 1>is squat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On these nasal sounds,</v>

120
00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:47.870
<v Speaker 1>guarani has six oral vowels and six </v>
<v Speaker 1>nasal vowels.</v>

121
00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:50.570
<v Speaker 1>Also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all voiced stops are either pre,</v>

122
00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:51.413
<v Speaker 1>nasally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>before an oral vowel or initialized </v>

123
00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:55.100
<v Speaker 1>before a nasal valve.</v>

124
00:06:56.630 --> 00:07:00.650
<v Speaker 1>There's also nasal harmony,</v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning that stressed nasal vowels cause</v>

125
00:07:00.651 --> 00:07:03.230
<v Speaker 1>other surrounding sounds to become nasal</v>
<v Speaker 1>as well.</v>

126
00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:05.630
<v Speaker 1>We can see an example of this in this </v>
<v Speaker 1>sentence.</v>

127
00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:10.120
<v Speaker 1>I do a session on her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the word for clothes and this is</v>

128
00:07:10.121 --> 00:07:13.690
<v Speaker 1>a future efforts showing that the known </v>
<v Speaker 1>will be obtained in the future.</v>

129
00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:17.230
<v Speaker 1>This ethics has a nasal vowel which </v>
<v Speaker 1>makes the earlier vowels,</v>

130
00:07:17.231 --> 00:07:19.060
<v Speaker 1>nasal as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Listen for it.</v>

131
00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:21.490
<v Speaker 1>I do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do.</v>

132
00:07:23.130 --> 00:07:25.690
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so let's check out one final language.</v>

<v Speaker 1>mosquito ligand faking tele fish.</v>

137
00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:39.040
<v Speaker 1>I guess Domico of Mcclellan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Komatsu is marching on spouse,</v>

138
00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:40.753
<v Speaker 1>pre atomic dome fain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now let's look at a few samples with </v>

139
00:07:44.331 --> 00:07:45.164
<v Speaker 1>writing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but welcome Ada cannock for she lower </v>

140
00:07:47.851 --> 00:07:49.230
<v Speaker 1>Air Issaquah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>own Liberland,</v>

141
00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:51.480
<v Speaker 1>neve egg,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dinair gigamon knocked,</v>

142
00:07:52.030 --> 00:07:54.160
<v Speaker 1>so what language do you think it might </v>
<v Speaker 1>be?</v>

143
00:08:00.490 --> 00:08:03.760
<v Speaker 1>The language is Irish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as you can probably guess.</v>

144
00:08:03.820 --> 00:08:06.100
<v Speaker 1>Irish is the historical language of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Ireland.</v>

145
00:08:06.340 --> 00:08:07.173
<v Speaker 1>It still spoken as a native language </v>
<v Speaker 1>there by a minority of people and has </v>

146
00:08:10.391 --> 00:08:13.720
<v Speaker 1>learned as a heritage language by most </v>
<v Speaker 1>others to varying degrees.</v>

147
00:08:14.410 --> 00:08:18.640
<v Speaker 1>It's also known as Irish Gaelic and is a</v>
<v Speaker 1>member of the Celtic language family.</v>

148
00:08:19.330 --> 00:08:20.163
<v Speaker 1>One interesting feature of Irish is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>all consonants have two forms abroad </v>

149
00:08:23.860 --> 00:08:27.370
<v Speaker 1>form and a slender form depending on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>surrounding vowels.</v>

150
00:08:27.460 --> 00:08:32.050
<v Speaker 1>There are three broad vowels in three </v>
<v Speaker 1>slender vowels that determine which form</v>

151
00:08:32.051 --> 00:08:32.884
<v Speaker 1>of the consonant is used.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The slender form of the consonants are </v>

152
00:08:35.171 --> 00:08:36.004
<v Speaker 1>palatalized,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which generally sounds like a place to </v>

153
00:08:38.591 --> 00:08:41.140
<v Speaker 1>write after the continent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we look at this word,</v>

154
00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:44.140
<v Speaker 1>piano,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we see this consonant twice.</v>

155
00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:48.400
<v Speaker 1>The first is before a narrow vowel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the second is after abroad vowel.</v>

156
00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:52.060
<v Speaker 1>The broad form is God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the narrow form is like,</v>

157
00:08:52.430 --> 00:08:53.263
<v Speaker 1>ha ha.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are similar Paris for all </v>

158
00:08:56.151 --> 00:08:56.984
<v Speaker 1>continents.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can see another example of this in </v>

159
00:08:59.811 --> 00:09:03.950
<v Speaker 1>the word junior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The d sound is next to a narrow vowel,</v>

160
00:09:03.980 --> 00:09:08.420
<v Speaker 1>so what's palatalized like deer or Jay </v>
<v Speaker 1>Vignette yet?</v>

161
00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:12.280
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if all speakers say the </v>
<v Speaker 1>narrow consonants the same way and to be</v>

162
00:09:12.281 --> 00:09:13.114
<v Speaker 1>honest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't hear it in this word on the </v>

163
00:09:14.291 --> 00:09:15.490
<v Speaker 1>recording.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We listened to it,</v>

164
00:09:15.670 --> 00:09:18.400
<v Speaker 1>but I can hear it in this sample from </v>
<v Speaker 1>the [inaudible] website.</v>

165
00:09:21.310 --> 00:09:26.310
<v Speaker 1>10 Deanna,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the genius in this sample.</v>

166
00:09:30.891 --> 00:09:33.980
<v Speaker 1>We can hear the narrow d sound as well </v>
<v Speaker 1>as a narrow end,</v>

167
00:09:34.010 --> 00:09:35.520
<v Speaker 1>which makes the sound.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

168
00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:39.120
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
