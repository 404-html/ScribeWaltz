1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:00.893
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2
00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:20.360
<v Speaker 2>Hello everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Welcome to the Lange focus channel.</v>

3
00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:21.443
<v Speaker 2>My name is Paul.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Today's topic is the languages of </v>

4
00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:27.020
<v Speaker 2>Belgium.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When most people think of Belgium,</v>

5
00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:29.780
<v Speaker 2>they think of Belgian chocolate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Belgian waffles,</v>

6
00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:30.673
<v Speaker 2>Belgian beer and things like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there is much more to Belgium than </v>

7
00:00:33.681 --> 00:00:34.514
<v Speaker 2>those things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>including a very interesting linguistic </v>

8
00:00:36.231 --> 00:00:37.550
<v Speaker 2>situation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>First,</v>

9
00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:41.960
<v Speaker 2>let's get some geographic perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Belgium is located in western Europe,</v>

10
00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:43.003
<v Speaker 2>bordering France to the south and </v>
<v Speaker 2>southwest Netherlands to the north and </v>

11
00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:49.760
<v Speaker 2>northeast Germany to the east and </v>
<v Speaker 2>Luxembourg to the southeast.</v>

12
00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:54.200
<v Speaker 2>This geographic location is reflected in</v>
<v Speaker 2>Belgium's linguistic diversity.</v>

13
00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:57.260
<v Speaker 2>Belgium has three official languages,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dutch,</v>

14
00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:00.020
<v Speaker 2>which has historically been spoken by </v>
<v Speaker 2>the Flemish people,</v>

15
00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:01.183
<v Speaker 2>French,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which has historically been spoken by </v>

16
00:01:02.691 --> 00:01:03.524
<v Speaker 2>the balloon people and German.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These three languages ended up being a </v>

17
00:01:07.101 --> 00:01:09.860
<v Speaker 2>part of this one country because of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Belgium's history.</v>

18
00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:14.120
<v Speaker 2>The low countries which include Belgium,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Netherlands and Luxembourg have been</v>

19
00:01:14.121 --> 00:01:16.250
<v Speaker 2>strategically important throughout the </v>
<v Speaker 2>ages.</v>

20
00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:19.040
<v Speaker 2>The low countries were ruled by a </v>
<v Speaker 2>succession of rulers.</v>

21
00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.933
<v Speaker 2>Eventually coming under the rule of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Spanish empire and 1556 and became </v>

22
00:01:23.691 --> 00:01:24.524
<v Speaker 2>referred to as Spanish Netherlands.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Dutch revolt of 1568 to 1581 </v>

23
00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:32.000
<v Speaker 2>resulted in the independence of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>northern provinces,</v>

24
00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:35.630
<v Speaker 2>which became the Dutch republic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which separated the Dutch from Belgium.</v>

25
00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:36.583
<v Speaker 2>Even though the northern part of Belgium</v>
<v Speaker 2>spoke the same language with different </v>

26
00:01:39.321 --> 00:01:40.250
<v Speaker 2>dialects.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course,</v>

27
00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:43.790
<v Speaker 2>in 1713 after the Spanish war of </v>
<v Speaker 2>succession,</v>

28
00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.893
<v Speaker 2>the Spanish Netherlands,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the southern part minus the Dutch </v>

29
00:01:46.941 --> 00:01:47.774
<v Speaker 2>republic came under Austrian control.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then in 1794 it came under French </v>

30
00:01:51.891 --> 00:01:52.724
<v Speaker 2>control and soon after that the Dutch </v>
<v Speaker 2>republic was also brought under French </v>

31
00:01:56.031 --> 00:01:56.864
<v Speaker 2>control.</v>
<v Speaker 2>After Napoleon's defeat the Napoleonic </v>

32
00:01:59.931 --> 00:02:00.764
<v Speaker 2>wars,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the United Kingdom of the Netherlands </v>

33
00:02:02.241 --> 00:02:05.960
<v Speaker 2>was created in 1815 which included </v>
<v Speaker 2>present they Netherlands,</v>

34
00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:07.730
<v Speaker 2>Belgium,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as well as Luxembourg.</v>

35
00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:09.373
<v Speaker 2>After the Belgian revolution of 1830 the</v>
<v Speaker 2>kingdom of Belgium was created with the </v>

36
00:02:13.131 --> 00:02:14.090
<v Speaker 2>support of France.</v>

37
00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:15.103
<v Speaker 2>At first,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Belgium was a single state with one </v>

38
00:02:16.731 --> 00:02:17.564
<v Speaker 2>official language French.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even though the majority of people were </v>

39
00:02:19.851 --> 00:02:20.684
<v Speaker 2>not French speakers in the 20th century,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a series of changes resulted in a </v>

40
00:02:24.291 --> 00:02:26.810
<v Speaker 2>federal system with three official </v>
<v Speaker 2>languages.</v>

41
00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:28.223
<v Speaker 2>Dutch just spoken as a native language </v>
<v Speaker 2>by around 55% of the population and by </v>

42
00:02:32.211 --> 00:02:35.360
<v Speaker 2>around 13% of the population as a second</v>
<v Speaker 2>language.</v>

43
00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:40.570
<v Speaker 2>French is spoken as a native language by</v>
<v Speaker 2>approximately 36% of the population with</v>

44
00:02:40.731 --> 00:02:44.570
<v Speaker 2>about 45% of the population speaking at </v>
<v Speaker 2>as a second language.</v>

45
00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:47.450
<v Speaker 2>German is much less widely spoken as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>native language.</v>

46
00:02:47.451 --> 00:02:52.451
<v Speaker 2>Then the other two by less than 1% what </v>
<v Speaker 2>around 22% of the population speak it as</v>

47
00:02:52.551 --> 00:02:53.384
<v Speaker 2>a second language.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The three official languages are </v>

48
00:02:55.101 --> 00:02:58.250
<v Speaker 2>generally concentrated in distinct </v>
<v Speaker 2>linguistic areas.</v>

49
00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:01.510
<v Speaker 2>Dutch is the language of the Flanders </v>
<v Speaker 2>region in the north.</v>

50
00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:06.040
<v Speaker 2>French is the primary language of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Wallonia region to the south with German</v>

51
00:03:06.041 --> 00:03:09.880
<v Speaker 2>being the primary language of some areas</v>
<v Speaker 2>of eastern Wallonia near the border with</v>

52
00:03:09.881 --> 00:03:10.714
<v Speaker 2>Germany.</v>

53
00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:11.793
<v Speaker 2>The Brussels Capitol region is </v>
<v Speaker 2>officially bilingual with Dutch and </v>

54
00:03:14.501 --> 00:03:15.334
<v Speaker 2>French being the two languages.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are no official statistics about </v>

55
00:03:17.921 --> 00:03:20.350
<v Speaker 2>the number of speakers of each language </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the capital,</v>

56
00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:23.170
<v Speaker 2>but it's quite obvious that French is </v>
<v Speaker 2>the predominant language.</v>

57
00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:27.010
<v Speaker 2>The Belgian federal state consists of </v>
<v Speaker 2>three administrative regions,</v>

58
00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:28.360
<v Speaker 2>Flanders,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wallonia,</v>

59
00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:29.343
<v Speaker 2>and the Brussels Capitol region,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as well as three federal communities </v>

60
00:03:32.201 --> 00:03:33.034
<v Speaker 2>based on language.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Flemish community has authority and </v>

61
00:03:35.261 --> 00:03:38.140
<v Speaker 2>the Flemish provinces and in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Brussels capitol region.</v>

62
00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:41.260
<v Speaker 2>The French community has authority and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the balloon provinces,</v>

63
00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:42.333
<v Speaker 2>with the exception of the German </v>
<v Speaker 2>speaking municipalities as well as in </v>

64
00:03:45.041 --> 00:03:45.874
<v Speaker 2>the Brussels capitol region alongside </v>
<v Speaker 2>the Flemish communities and the German </v>

65
00:03:49.031 --> 00:03:49.864
<v Speaker 2>speaking community has authority and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>German speaking municipalities of the </v>

66
00:03:52.841 --> 00:03:53.674
<v Speaker 2>province of lineage in Wallonia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The areas administered by the German </v>

67
00:03:57.341 --> 00:03:58.174
<v Speaker 2>speaking community are the areas given </v>
<v Speaker 2>to Belgium by Germany in 1920 under the </v>

68
00:04:01.931 --> 00:04:02.764
<v Speaker 2>treaty of Versailles,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the federal communities each have their </v>

69
00:04:04.811 --> 00:04:05.644
<v Speaker 2>own government and parliament,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which are distinct from the regional </v>

70
00:04:08.141 --> 00:04:09.280
<v Speaker 2>government and parliament.</v>

71
00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:12.520
<v Speaker 2>The governments of the communities have </v>
<v Speaker 2>power over matters of culture,</v>

72
00:04:12.521 --> 00:04:14.050
<v Speaker 2>education,</v>
<v Speaker 2>health services,</v>

73
00:04:14.051 --> 00:04:14.884
<v Speaker 2>and social services.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's in contrast with the regional </v>

74
00:04:17.111 --> 00:04:19.870
<v Speaker 2>governments that have power over matters</v>
<v Speaker 2>of economy,</v>

75
00:04:19.871 --> 00:04:21.520
<v Speaker 2>infrastructure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>town planning,</v>

76
00:04:21.521 --> 00:04:23.910
<v Speaker 2>and so on and in the Brussels capitol </v>
<v Speaker 2>regions,</v>

77
00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:24.753
<v Speaker 2>the Flemish and French community </v>
<v Speaker 2>governments and the regional government </v>

78
00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:30.400
<v Speaker 2>are merged together into one within the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Flanders region.</v>

79
00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:34.720
<v Speaker 2>Most municipalities offer services only </v>
<v Speaker 2>in Dutch and in the Wallonia region.</v>

80
00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:37.840
<v Speaker 2>Most municipalities offer services only </v>
<v Speaker 2>in French,</v>

81
00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:38.943
<v Speaker 2>but there are some municipalities with </v>
<v Speaker 2>language facilities that also offer a </v>

82
00:04:42.191 --> 00:04:45.640
<v Speaker 2>public services like schools and courts </v>
<v Speaker 2>in another language as well.</v>

83
00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:46.713
<v Speaker 2>These municipalities are typically those</v>
<v Speaker 2>bordering a different linguistic area </v>

84
00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:50.673
<v Speaker 2>administered by a different linguistic </v>
<v Speaker 2>community or bordering the Brussels </v>

85
00:04:54.041 --> 00:04:57.730
<v Speaker 2>Capitol region.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are 12 municipalities in flanders,</v>

86
00:04:57.731 --> 00:04:58.564
<v Speaker 2>which offers services in French,</v>
<v Speaker 2>six of which have a French speaking </v>

87
00:05:01.271 --> 00:05:03.640
<v Speaker 2>majority and in French speaking </v>
<v Speaker 2>Wallonia,</v>

88
00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:04.503
<v Speaker 2>there are four municipalities offering </v>
<v Speaker 2>services in Dutch and two more offering </v>

89
00:05:08.021 --> 00:05:08.854
<v Speaker 2>services in German and all of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>municipalities and the German speaking </v>

90
00:05:11.711 --> 00:05:15.550
<v Speaker 2>part of Wallonia offer services in </v>
<v Speaker 2>French and in the Capitol region.</v>

91
00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:18.490
<v Speaker 2>All services are offered in both French </v>
<v Speaker 2>and in Dutch.</v>

92
00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:19.593
<v Speaker 2>And I should note that all federal </v>
<v Speaker 2>services are provided in all three </v>

93
00:05:22.091 --> 00:05:26.230
<v Speaker 2>official languages at the national level</v>
<v Speaker 2>language varieties.</v>

94
00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:27.453
<v Speaker 2>So we know that there are three official</v>
<v Speaker 2>languages with their respective </v>

95
00:05:29.861 --> 00:05:32.710
<v Speaker 2>communities and areas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's more to it than that.</v>

96
00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:33.963
<v Speaker 2>One of the official languages is Dutch,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but is it the same as the Dutch spoken </v>

97
00:05:37.181 --> 00:05:38.014
<v Speaker 2>in The Netherlands?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well remember that a language normally </v>

98
00:05:40.391 --> 00:05:41.224
<v Speaker 2>consists of a number of different </v>
<v Speaker 2>dialects that are usually united by a </v>

99
00:05:44.381 --> 00:05:45.214
<v Speaker 2>common standard language.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The standard form of Dutch used in </v>

100
00:05:47.591 --> 00:05:51.160
<v Speaker 2>Belgium is basically the same as the </v>
<v Speaker 2>standard form used in the Netherlands,</v>

101
00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:54.730
<v Speaker 2>but the dialects that people grow up </v>
<v Speaker 2>speaking are different than those spoken</v>

102
00:05:54.731 --> 00:05:57.770
<v Speaker 2>in the Netherlands and the different </v>
<v Speaker 2>quite a lot from each other as well.</v>

103
00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:02.690
<v Speaker 2>The dialects of Dutch spoken and </v>
<v Speaker 2>flinders are often collectively referred</v>

104
00:06:02.691 --> 00:06:03.710
<v Speaker 2>to as Flemish.</v>

105
00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:07.970
<v Speaker 2>The main dialect groups are in and east,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Flemish and west.</v>

106
00:06:07.971 --> 00:06:10.700
<v Speaker 2>Flemish and Limberg ish are sometimes </v>
<v Speaker 2>included as well.</v>

107
00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:11.683
<v Speaker 2>Though these are often considered </v>
<v Speaker 2>distinct enough to be separate regional </v>

108
00:06:14.091 --> 00:06:16.400
<v Speaker 2>languages.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Limburger cheese for example,</v>

109
00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:19.640
<v Speaker 2>has some features that are closer to </v>
<v Speaker 2>German than other Dutch dialect.</v>

110
00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:20.773
<v Speaker 2>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>personal pronouns that are similar to </v>

111
00:06:22.251 --> 00:06:26.840
<v Speaker 2>the German ones like myth do this and so</v>
<v Speaker 2>on.</v>

112
00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:28.543
<v Speaker 2>Exactly where to draw the boundaries of </v>
<v Speaker 2>a language and deciding which dialects </v>

113
00:06:31.761 --> 00:06:34.340
<v Speaker 2>are included in that language is often a</v>
<v Speaker 2>tricky question.</v>

114
00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:37.430
<v Speaker 2>There's no black and white distinction </v>
<v Speaker 2>between Dutch and German,</v>

115
00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:40.400
<v Speaker 2>but rather there's a west Germanic </v>
<v Speaker 2>dialect continuum.</v>

116
00:06:40.401 --> 00:06:41.234
<v Speaker 2>Spending a wide area and language </v>
<v Speaker 2>features gradually change as you move </v>

117
00:06:44.451 --> 00:06:45.284
<v Speaker 2>along.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The continuum and the standard language </v>

118
00:06:47.151 --> 00:06:47.984
<v Speaker 2>that a dialect is paired with often for </v>
<v Speaker 2>political reasons is a big factor in </v>

119
00:06:51.441 --> 00:06:54.110
<v Speaker 2>what language or a dialect is considered</v>
<v Speaker 2>to belong to.</v>

120
00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:55.513
<v Speaker 2>Of course the promotion of Standard </v>
<v Speaker 2>Dutch has caused Flemish dialects to </v>

121
00:06:58.191 --> 00:06:59.024
<v Speaker 2>fade to some extent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but some differences in vocabulary and </v>

122
00:07:01.431 --> 00:07:05.360
<v Speaker 2>pronunciation remain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's also a new variety of Dutch that</v>

123
00:07:05.361 --> 00:07:06.194
<v Speaker 2>has arisen called [inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's basically a middle ground between </v>

124
00:07:09.201 --> 00:07:10.034
<v Speaker 2>standard Dutch and Flemish dialects,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but from a lot of comments I've seen </v>

125
00:07:13.401 --> 00:07:17.030
<v Speaker 2>online that seems like a lot of people </v>
<v Speaker 2>dislike this variety of Dutch.</v>

126
00:07:17.031 --> 00:07:17.864
<v Speaker 2>They think it sounds artificial.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The situation with French is also </v>

127
00:07:20.601 --> 00:07:21.434
<v Speaker 2>interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Standard French is learned by everyone </v>

128
00:07:23.391 --> 00:07:24.224
<v Speaker 2>in the French speaking areas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's paired with traditional </v>

129
00:07:26.331 --> 00:07:31.331
<v Speaker 2>dialects like walloon or while loan </v>
<v Speaker 2>peacock Sean Penn won and Loja,</v>

130
00:07:31.850 --> 00:07:34.490
<v Speaker 2>which are arguably separate regional </v>
<v Speaker 2>languages.</v>

131
00:07:35.030 --> 00:07:37.550
<v Speaker 2>They belonged to the longer boy in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>branch of the Gallo.</v>

132
00:07:37.551 --> 00:07:39.800
<v Speaker 2>Romance languages as standard French </v>
<v Speaker 2>does,</v>

133
00:07:39.950 --> 00:07:43.010
<v Speaker 2>but they are distinct from it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These regional languages have,</v>

134
00:07:43.011 --> 00:07:47.060
<v Speaker 2>for the most part been replaced by </v>
<v Speaker 2>standard French and are mainly spoken by</v>

135
00:07:47.061 --> 00:07:49.940
<v Speaker 2>an aging population and particularly in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the countryside.</v>

136
00:07:50.330 --> 00:07:53.000
<v Speaker 2>These lung,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the oil in Wallonia have not remained in</v>

137
00:07:53.001 --> 00:07:55.910
<v Speaker 2>use as much as the Flemish dialects and </v>
<v Speaker 2>flenders have.</v>

138
00:07:56.210 --> 00:07:58.760
<v Speaker 2>Why is that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's partly because during the</v>

139
00:07:58.761 --> 00:08:03.110
<v Speaker 2>period of French rule when the use of </v>
<v Speaker 2>French was highly encouraged speakers of</v>

140
00:08:03.111 --> 00:08:07.430
<v Speaker 2>closely related regional languages found</v>
<v Speaker 2>it much easier to adapt to French.</v>

141
00:08:07.460 --> 00:08:08.293
<v Speaker 2>Then the speakers of Flemish dialects in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the north did and maybe because those </v>

142
00:08:11.661 --> 00:08:13.850
<v Speaker 2>languages are so closely related to </v>
<v Speaker 2>French,</v>

143
00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:14.713
<v Speaker 2>their speakers felt that they were just </v>
<v Speaker 2>making a small adjustment rather than </v>

144
00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:20.570
<v Speaker 2>giving up something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's my speculation as is the case</v>

145
00:08:20.571 --> 00:08:21.404
<v Speaker 2>with Dutch and French.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Belgium has a number of dialects that </v>

146
00:08:23.721 --> 00:08:24.554
<v Speaker 2>are considered to be a part of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>German language alongside standard </v>

147
00:08:27.021 --> 00:08:27.854
<v Speaker 2>German.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The German dialects of the officially </v>

148
00:08:29.390 --> 00:08:30.223
<v Speaker 2>German speaking areas are central German</v>
<v Speaker 2>dialects including Repu area in the </v>

149
00:08:33.771 --> 00:08:34.604
<v Speaker 2>northern part of the area and Moselle </v>
<v Speaker 2>Franconia in the southern part of the </v>

150
00:08:37.581 --> 00:08:38.240
<v Speaker 2>area.</v>

151
00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:40.940
<v Speaker 2>These dialects differ significantly from</v>
<v Speaker 2>standard German,</v>

152
00:08:40.970 --> 00:08:41.803
<v Speaker 2>but standard German has had an influence</v>
<v Speaker 2>on them resulting in some dialect </v>

153
00:08:44.721 --> 00:08:45.554
<v Speaker 2>leveling,</v>
<v Speaker 2>meaning that the dialects are not as </v>

154
00:08:47.001 --> 00:08:47.834
<v Speaker 2>different from standard German anymore </v>
<v Speaker 2>and not as different from each other </v>

155
00:08:50.241 --> 00:08:51.074
<v Speaker 2>anymore and speakers up those dialects </v>
<v Speaker 2>use some French vocabulary in their </v>

156
00:08:54.081 --> 00:08:54.914
<v Speaker 2>speech because of the influence of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>surrounding French speakers in the </v>

157
00:08:57.361 --> 00:08:58.194
<v Speaker 2>Willow Nia region and I believe the </v>
<v Speaker 2>majority of German speakers are </v>

158
00:09:00.721 --> 00:09:01.554
<v Speaker 2>bilingual and can speak French as well </v>
<v Speaker 2>because Belgium is part of a Germanic </v>

159
00:09:06.931 --> 00:09:07.764
<v Speaker 2>dialect continuum.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are a number of dialects that </v>

160
00:09:09.781 --> 00:09:12.750
<v Speaker 2>don't clearly fall under any of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>three official languages.</v>

161
00:09:12.900 --> 00:09:13.733
<v Speaker 2>One such language as low deach,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is a number of transitional </v>

162
00:09:16.231 --> 00:09:17.064
<v Speaker 2>dialects between Lindbergh Ish,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is often considered a flemish </v>

163
00:09:19.531 --> 00:09:22.260
<v Speaker 2>dialect and the rip you Arion dialect of</v>
<v Speaker 2>German.</v>

164
00:09:22.470 --> 00:09:23.303
<v Speaker 2>It's spoken in a few towns and villages </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the municipality of open in the </v>

165
00:09:26.461 --> 00:09:27.294
<v Speaker 2>German speaking part of the edge,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but rather than simply being considered </v>

166
00:09:30.031 --> 00:09:30.864
<v Speaker 2>a dialect of German,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's unique enough to be considered its </v>

167
00:09:33.001 --> 00:09:34.110
<v Speaker 2>own regional language.</v>

168
00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:35.753
<v Speaker 2>Certain varieties of low ditch are very </v>
<v Speaker 2>close to certain varieties of Limburg </v>

169
00:09:38.941 --> 00:09:39.774
<v Speaker 2>ish,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is sometimes considered a flemish </v>

170
00:09:40.951 --> 00:09:42.450
<v Speaker 2>dialects,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a Dutch dialect,</v>

171
00:09:42.630 --> 00:09:43.463
<v Speaker 2>but other varieties of low deach are </v>
<v Speaker 2>very close to certain varieties of </v>

172
00:09:46.100 --> 00:09:50.820
<v Speaker 2>riparian which are considered varieties </v>
<v Speaker 2>of German classifying these very similar</v>

173
00:09:50.821 --> 00:09:51.654
<v Speaker 2>dialects as different languages is one </v>
<v Speaker 2>of those confusing and mystifying </v>

174
00:09:54.661 --> 00:09:57.930
<v Speaker 2>aspects of linguistics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then there's Luxembourg ish.</v>

175
00:09:57.960 --> 00:10:00.420
<v Speaker 2>It's spoken in the Belgian province of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Luxembourg,</v>

176
00:10:00.450 --> 00:10:02.610
<v Speaker 2>which has the same name as the </v>
<v Speaker 2>neighboring country.</v>

177
00:10:02.790 --> 00:10:05.580
<v Speaker 2>Even though it's closely related to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>surrounding Moselle,</v>

178
00:10:05.581 --> 00:10:06.414
<v Speaker 2>Franconia and German dialects.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not normally considered a dialect </v>

179
00:10:09.361 --> 00:10:10.194
<v Speaker 2>of German.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's partly because it has its own </v>

180
00:10:11.461 --> 00:10:12.294
<v Speaker 2>standardized written form and it </v>
<v Speaker 2>speakers are not considered members of </v>

181
00:10:15.031 --> 00:10:18.510
<v Speaker 2>the German speaking community but rather</v>
<v Speaker 2>speakers of a regional language.</v>

182
00:10:18.660 --> 00:10:19.493
<v Speaker 2>The area in which Luxembourg she has </v>
<v Speaker 2>spoken is inside French speaking </v>

183
00:10:22.171 --> 00:10:25.680
<v Speaker 2>Wallonia where Luxembourg ish is </v>
<v Speaker 2>recognized as a regional language,</v>

184
00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:28.920
<v Speaker 2>but the use of Luxembourg ishe has </v>
<v Speaker 2>declined in favor of French.</v>

185
00:10:31.290 --> 00:10:32.123
<v Speaker 2>Much of what I say in this section will </v>
<v Speaker 2>be based on comments that I've read </v>

186
00:10:34.321 --> 00:10:35.154
<v Speaker 2>online written by a Belgian people and </v>
<v Speaker 2>comments I've heard from Belgian people </v>

187
00:10:38.221 --> 00:10:39.054
<v Speaker 2>face to face.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As you can see from the statistics we </v>

188
00:10:40.831 --> 00:10:41.664
<v Speaker 2>looked at earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most Belgians can speak at least two of </v>

189
00:10:43.681 --> 00:10:44.514
<v Speaker 2>the official languages at least to some </v>
<v Speaker 2>extent in particular Dutch speakers can </v>

190
00:10:47.881 --> 00:10:48.714
<v Speaker 2>usually speak some French,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but according to a lot of comments that </v>

191
00:10:50.971 --> 00:10:53.760
<v Speaker 2>I've read that some Dutch speakers are </v>
<v Speaker 2>reluctant to speak French,</v>

192
00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:54.713
<v Speaker 2>especially in a Dutch speaking area.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's quite common in bilingual places </v>

193
00:10:57.811 --> 00:10:58.644
<v Speaker 2>for speakers of one language to resent </v>
<v Speaker 2>having to speak the other language if </v>

194
00:11:01.771 --> 00:11:04.950
<v Speaker 2>they feel that their own language isn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>being given equal status.</v>

195
00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:05.873
<v Speaker 2>French has traditionally been the higher</v>
<v Speaker 2>status language in Belgium and Dutch </v>

196
00:11:08.791 --> 00:11:09.624
<v Speaker 2>speakers had to learn it in order to </v>
<v Speaker 2>advance in life for it to get a better </v>

197
00:11:12.811 --> 00:11:14.040
<v Speaker 2>job than that kind of thing.</v>

198
00:11:14.250 --> 00:11:15.083
<v Speaker 2>So maybe because of this sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>historical rivalry there might be some </v>

199
00:11:17.791 --> 00:11:18.624
<v Speaker 2>resistance to speaking French.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's just my impression based on </v>

200
00:11:20.971 --> 00:11:23.670
<v Speaker 2>things I've heard or read and I can't </v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly say for certain,</v>

201
00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:26.633
<v Speaker 2>and these days,</v>
<v Speaker 2>English is becoming much more widely </v>

202
00:11:28.081 --> 00:11:31.260
<v Speaker 2>used as a second language in flanders.</v>
<v Speaker 2>While French has declined,</v>

203
00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:32.273
<v Speaker 2>some young people who speak mostly Dutch</v>
<v Speaker 2>and flanders might speak English when </v>

204
00:11:35.101 --> 00:11:35.934
<v Speaker 2>they encounter a French speaker or when </v>
<v Speaker 2>they visit the bilingual city of </v>

205
00:11:38.281 --> 00:11:39.114
<v Speaker 2>Brussels.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Education in Belgium is different </v>

206
00:11:40.621 --> 00:11:43.920
<v Speaker 2>depending on the linguistic community </v>
<v Speaker 2>that administers that area.</v>

207
00:11:44.010 --> 00:11:44.843
<v Speaker 2>In Flanders,</v>
<v Speaker 2>students begin learning French in the </v>

208
00:11:46.351 --> 00:11:47.184
<v Speaker 2>fifth grade of elementary school and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then begin learning English in seventh </v>

209
00:11:49.951 --> 00:11:52.140
<v Speaker 2>grade,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and some students take German or another</v>

210
00:11:52.141 --> 00:11:52.974
<v Speaker 2>language later,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there are students who complained </v>

211
00:11:54.491 --> 00:11:55.324
<v Speaker 2>that the teaching methods emphasize </v>
<v Speaker 2>grammar and literacy rather than </v>

212
00:11:57.731 --> 00:11:58.564
<v Speaker 2>communication,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which leaves them without enough </v>

213
00:11:59.980 --> 00:12:01.570
<v Speaker 2>conversational confidence.</v>

214
00:12:01.900 --> 00:12:06.250
<v Speaker 2>Wallonia some French speakers are also </v>
<v Speaker 2>bilingual French Dutch speakers,</v>

215
00:12:06.370 --> 00:12:09.040
<v Speaker 2>but not as many of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But in recent decades,</v>

216
00:12:09.070 --> 00:12:09.903
<v Speaker 2>more French speakers are learning Dutch </v>
<v Speaker 2>because of the growing economic </v>

217
00:12:12.341 --> 00:12:16.060
<v Speaker 2>influence of Flanders.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The education system in Velonia offers a</v>

218
00:12:16.061 --> 00:12:18.850
<v Speaker 2>choice between Dutch and English.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Many choose Dutch,</v>

219
00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:19.713
<v Speaker 2>but again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't necessarily learn to </v>

220
00:12:20.681 --> 00:12:24.280
<v Speaker 2>communicate that well in the language.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A smaller but significant number,</v>

221
00:12:24.281 --> 00:12:26.620
<v Speaker 2>learn German,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but outside of the border areas.</v>

222
00:12:26.650 --> 00:12:28.450
<v Speaker 2>Few of them learn it to an advanced </v>
<v Speaker 2>level.</v>

223
00:12:28.451 --> 00:12:32.050
<v Speaker 2>From what I hear and as in Flanders,</v>
<v Speaker 2>English is growing in popularity.</v>

224
00:12:32.470 --> 00:12:33.303
<v Speaker 2>Brussels,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even though it's an enclave inside </v>

225
00:12:35.171 --> 00:12:36.004
<v Speaker 2>Flanders,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Brussels is officially bilingual and </v>

226
00:12:38.321 --> 00:12:39.154
<v Speaker 2>wild.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are no official counts of who </v>

227
00:12:40.001 --> 00:12:40.834
<v Speaker 2>speaks with language.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's an overwhelmingly French speaking </v>

228
00:12:43.061 --> 00:12:46.580
<v Speaker 2>city with many estimates saying it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>over 90% francophone.</v>

229
00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:47.673
<v Speaker 2>Both French and Dutch schools are </v>
<v Speaker 2>available and each family can choose </v>

230
00:12:50.411 --> 00:12:51.244
<v Speaker 2>which type of school to send their </v>
<v Speaker 2>children to regardless of what language </v>

231
00:12:53.651 --> 00:12:56.050
<v Speaker 2>they speak at home and at shops and </v>
<v Speaker 2>restaurants.</v>

232
00:12:56.080 --> 00:12:58.390
<v Speaker 2>Staff should be able to speak both </v>
<v Speaker 2>languages,</v>

233
00:12:58.450 --> 00:13:02.260
<v Speaker 2>at least in theory,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's a major capital and as the de</v>

234
00:13:02.261 --> 00:13:03.094
<v Speaker 2>facto capital of the European Union.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Brussels is a very international and </v>

235
00:13:06.461 --> 00:13:07.294
<v Speaker 2>linguistically diverse place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Many languages are spoken among the </v>

236
00:13:09.881 --> 00:13:14.140
<v Speaker 2>expat communities with English serving </v>
<v Speaker 2>as a Lingua Franca alongside French.</v>

237
00:13:14.410 --> 00:13:15.243
<v Speaker 2>There are also many immigrants.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In 2010 about 18% of the population of </v>

238
00:13:19.241 --> 00:13:20.074
<v Speaker 2>Belgium was foreign born.</v>
<v Speaker 2>While in Brussels the number was around </v>

239
00:13:22.541 --> 00:13:23.374
<v Speaker 2>33% many of these people and their </v>
<v Speaker 2>children are native speakers of </v>

240
00:13:26.261 --> 00:13:28.330
<v Speaker 2>languages other than Dutch,</v>
<v Speaker 2>French and German.</v>

241
00:13:28.420 --> 00:13:29.253
<v Speaker 2>From what I understand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>many of these people speak a foreign </v>

242
00:13:31.091 --> 00:13:33.910
<v Speaker 2>language at home,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of Belgium's official languages,</v>

243
00:13:34.240 --> 00:13:37.450
<v Speaker 2>probably Dutch or French and in many </v>
<v Speaker 2>cases English as well.</v>

244
00:13:38.650 --> 00:13:39.483
<v Speaker 2>The German speaking community because of</v>
<v Speaker 2>their proximity to French speaking </v>

245
00:13:42.491 --> 00:13:45.730
<v Speaker 2>Wallonia and because French is a </v>
<v Speaker 2>required subject in schools,</v>

246
00:13:45.850 --> 00:13:50.290
<v Speaker 2>in the German speaking community areas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most German speakers can speak French as</v>

247
00:13:50.291 --> 00:13:52.360
<v Speaker 2>well as German and from what I </v>
<v Speaker 2>understand,</v>

248
00:13:52.390 --> 00:13:53.223
<v Speaker 2>many speak Dutch as well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is probably helped by the fact </v>

249
00:13:55.661 --> 00:14:00.040
<v Speaker 2>that Dutch and German are closely </v>
<v Speaker 2>related media in Belgium.</v>

250
00:14:00.070 --> 00:14:00.903
<v Speaker 2>The media in each linguistic area is </v>
<v Speaker 2>dominated by the language of that </v>

251
00:14:03.671 --> 00:14:05.980
<v Speaker 2>region.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Each of the three linguistic communities</v>

252
00:14:05.981 --> 00:14:08.470
<v Speaker 2>has its own public broadcasting </v>
<v Speaker 2>organization,</v>

253
00:14:08.500 --> 00:14:09.333
<v Speaker 2>which is responsible for creating </v>
<v Speaker 2>content and administering radio and TV </v>

254
00:14:12.821 --> 00:14:13.654
<v Speaker 2>stations and so on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The result is that the members of each </v>

255
00:14:15.671 --> 00:14:16.504
<v Speaker 2>linguistic community are primarily </v>
<v Speaker 2>exposed to only their own language </v>

256
00:14:19.271 --> 00:14:21.880
<v Speaker 2>through the media.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The notable exception is Brussels,</v>

257
00:14:21.881 --> 00:14:24.910
<v Speaker 2>where both the Flemish community and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>French speaking communities,</v>

258
00:14:24.911 --> 00:14:25.744
<v Speaker 2>public broadcasting organizations </v>
<v Speaker 2>operate Belgium as an interesting case </v>

259
00:14:30.821 --> 00:14:35.050
<v Speaker 2>because in some ways it operates like </v>
<v Speaker 2>three separate countries administered by</v>

260
00:14:35.051 --> 00:14:38.110
<v Speaker 2>three different linguistic communities </v>
<v Speaker 2>with their own governments.</v>

261
00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:39.033
<v Speaker 2>And the generally limited interaction </v>
<v Speaker 2>between flanders and Maloney up </v>

262
00:14:41.590 --> 00:14:44.650
<v Speaker 2>reinforces the kind of linguistic divide</v>
<v Speaker 2>or separation.</v>

263
00:14:44.860 --> 00:14:45.693
<v Speaker 2>But the majority of people speak two </v>
<v Speaker 2>official languages at least to some </v>

264
00:14:48.251 --> 00:14:49.084
<v Speaker 2>extent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and some of them speak three with a lot </v>

265
00:14:50.681 --> 00:14:54.500
<v Speaker 2>of people learning English these days as</v>
<v Speaker 2>in many multilingual federations.</v>

266
00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:55.393
<v Speaker 2>Some people speculate about whether the </v>
<v Speaker 2>country will fracture into separate </v>

267
00:14:58.101 --> 00:14:58.934
<v Speaker 2>countries and there are disagreements </v>
<v Speaker 2>about how to handle the complex </v>

268
00:15:01.641 --> 00:15:05.360
<v Speaker 2>governing of a federation with three </v>
<v Speaker 2>regional governments and three community</v>

269
00:15:05.361 --> 00:15:08.510
<v Speaker 2>governments based on language in </v>
<v Speaker 2>addition to a federal government.</v>

270
00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:09.553
<v Speaker 2>I can't claim to speak for Belgians,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but just from the comments that I've </v>

271
00:15:11.961 --> 00:15:12.794
<v Speaker 2>read and heard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it seems to me that Belgian people </v>

272
00:15:14.600 --> 00:15:19.070
<v Speaker 2>identify more as Flemish or walloon or </v>
<v Speaker 2>as German speaking then as Belgium,</v>

273
00:15:19.370 --> 00:15:20.203
<v Speaker 2>but they generally have no strong </v>
<v Speaker 2>objection to this federal system from </v>

274
00:15:22.761 --> 00:15:23.594
<v Speaker 2>what I can see.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But this kind of situation reminds us </v>

275
00:15:25.341 --> 00:15:28.220
<v Speaker 2>that languages are not just systems of </v>
<v Speaker 2>communication.</v>

276
00:15:28.250 --> 00:15:30.380
<v Speaker 2>They are also part of people's </v>
<v Speaker 2>identities.</v>

277
00:15:30.440 --> 00:15:31.273
<v Speaker 2>End of tremendous importance to people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The question of the day for people from </v>

278
00:15:34.281 --> 00:15:35.114
<v Speaker 2>Belgium,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's your native language and to what </v>

279
00:15:36.621 --> 00:15:40.100
<v Speaker 2>extent do you speak to the other </v>
<v Speaker 2>official languages and for other people?</v>

280
00:15:40.130 --> 00:15:40.963
<v Speaker 2>Let me ask a more general question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>To what extent do you see your native </v>

281
00:15:43.941 --> 00:15:44.774
<v Speaker 2>language as part of your identity?</v>
<v Speaker 2>For me as an English speaker from </v>

282
00:15:47.271 --> 00:15:48.104
<v Speaker 2>Canada,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my language is not really a strong part </v>

283
00:15:49.701 --> 00:15:52.130
<v Speaker 2>of my identity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just feels like the default,</v>

284
00:15:52.310 --> 00:15:54.920
<v Speaker 2>but I know it's different for a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>people around the world.</v>

285
00:15:55.130 --> 00:15:56.960
<v Speaker 2>How about you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Be sure to follow Lang,</v>

286
00:15:56.961 --> 00:15:58.610
<v Speaker 2>focus on facebook,</v>
<v Speaker 2>twitter,</v>

287
00:15:58.611 --> 00:16:00.320
<v Speaker 2>and Instagram,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and once again,</v>
