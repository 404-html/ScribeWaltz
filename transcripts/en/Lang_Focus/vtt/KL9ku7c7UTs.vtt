00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.480
<v Speaker 1>Hello everyone and welcome to the lange </v>
<v Speaker 1>focus channel.</v>

2
00:00:02.530 --> 00:00:03.363
<v Speaker 1>My name is Paul.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is another quick video about in </v>

3
00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:06.383
<v Speaker 1>linguistic concept.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This one is about something called die </v>

4
00:00:08.791 --> 00:00:09.624
<v Speaker 1>glossier.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This word deblasio originated from a </v>

5
00:00:11.551 --> 00:00:14.190
<v Speaker 1>Greek word meaning a state of being </v>
<v Speaker 1>bilingual.</v>

6
00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:15.113
<v Speaker 1>That glossier is a situation in which a </v>
<v Speaker 1>community uses two different languages </v>

7
00:00:18.121 --> 00:00:18.954
<v Speaker 1>or two significantly different varieties</v>
<v Speaker 1>of one language for different </v>

8
00:00:22.231 --> 00:00:23.064
<v Speaker 1>situations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The way it typically works is that one </v>

9
00:00:24.901 --> 00:00:25.734
<v Speaker 1>dialect or language is used for casual </v>
<v Speaker 1>everyday interaction and a different </v>

10
00:00:29.371 --> 00:00:30.204
<v Speaker 1>standard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Language is used for more official </v>

11
00:00:31.591 --> 00:00:34.590
<v Speaker 1>formal purposes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The dialect or language that is used for</v>

12
00:00:34.591 --> 00:00:37.560
<v Speaker 1>daily communication is typically a low </v>
<v Speaker 1>variety,</v>

13
00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:38.543
<v Speaker 1>meaning that it is not formally learned </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the speakers don't formally learn </v>

14
00:00:41.551 --> 00:00:43.830
<v Speaker 1>it's grammar or how to write in that </v>
<v Speaker 1>language.</v>

15
00:00:43.831 --> 00:00:45.930
<v Speaker 1>It's merely learned as a spoken </v>
<v Speaker 1>language.</v>

16
00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.500
<v Speaker 1>The language used for more formal </v>
<v Speaker 1>situations is the high variety.</v>

17
00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:50.393
<v Speaker 1>It is the language that is learned at </v>
<v Speaker 1>school formally and speakers learn how </v>

18
00:00:53.491 --> 00:00:54.324
<v Speaker 1>to write in that language and they learn</v>
<v Speaker 1>the formal grammar rules of that </v>

19
00:00:56.701 --> 00:00:57.960
<v Speaker 1>language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In many cases,</v>

20
00:00:57.961 --> 00:00:58.794
<v Speaker 1>the community considers this high </v>
<v Speaker 1>variety to be the pure or correct form </v>

21
00:01:01.831 --> 00:01:05.370
<v Speaker 1>of the language and they want to keep it</v>
<v Speaker 1>the same and not let it change.</v>

22
00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:06.323
<v Speaker 1>The low variety on the other hand is </v>
<v Speaker 1>more flexible and it's more likely to </v>

23
00:01:08.851 --> 00:01:09.684
<v Speaker 1>change over time because it's not </v>
<v Speaker 1>restricted by the rules of the high </v>

24
00:01:12.271 --> 00:01:13.104
<v Speaker 1>language died.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Glossier is very common around the </v>

25
00:01:14.941 --> 00:01:15.774
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The most commonly discussed example is </v>

26
00:01:17.131 --> 00:01:17.964
<v Speaker 1>probably the Arabic language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In every Arabic country there are </v>

27
00:01:20.641 --> 00:01:22.830
<v Speaker 1>different dialects that differ in </v>
<v Speaker 1>grammar,</v>

28
00:01:22.831 --> 00:01:25.440
<v Speaker 1>vocabulary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and pronunciation from other dialects,</v>

29
00:01:25.441 --> 00:01:26.274
<v Speaker 1>but also from standard Arabic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Standard Arabic is a very codafide </v>

30
00:01:29.281 --> 00:01:30.114
<v Speaker 1>language,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is basically fixed in its rules </v>

31
00:01:31.531 --> 00:01:34.860
<v Speaker 1>and doesn't really change while the </v>
<v Speaker 1>dialects are constantly evolving.</v>

32
00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:35.903
<v Speaker 1>In casual speech with other locals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Arabs exclusively used their local </v>

33
00:01:38.731 --> 00:01:41.400
<v Speaker 1>dialect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in writing and formal speeches and a</v>

34
00:01:41.401 --> 00:01:42.234
<v Speaker 1>news broadcast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>standard Arabic is used and standard </v>

35
00:01:44.611 --> 00:01:45.444
<v Speaker 1>Arabic is also used as a bridge language</v>
<v Speaker 1>when communicating with speakers from </v>

36
00:01:48.481 --> 00:01:51.090
<v Speaker 1>other dialects,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but really only when necessary,</v>

37
00:01:51.091 --> 00:01:52.920
<v Speaker 1>only when there's some trouble </v>
<v Speaker 1>communicating.</v>

38
00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:53.963
<v Speaker 1>Another example is in Italy where there </v>
<v Speaker 1>are numerous regional languages that </v>

39
00:01:56.851 --> 00:01:57.684
<v Speaker 1>function as the low variety.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While standard Italian functions as the </v>

40
00:02:00.451 --> 00:02:01.284
<v Speaker 1>high variety.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These regional languages are indeed </v>

41
00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:04.163
<v Speaker 1>distinct languages.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even though they are romance languages </v>

42
00:02:06.061 --> 00:02:08.730
<v Speaker 1>that are related to Italian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they are different languages,</v>

43
00:02:08.731 --> 00:02:09.564
<v Speaker 1>but they're often referred to as </v>
<v Speaker 1>dialects because they are not formally </v>

44
00:02:12.151 --> 00:02:14.070
<v Speaker 1>learned at school.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In recent times.</v>

45
00:02:14.071 --> 00:02:16.380
<v Speaker 1>These regional languages have faded to </v>
<v Speaker 1>some degree,</v>

46
00:02:16.381 --> 00:02:18.870
<v Speaker 1>but die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Glossier is still very common in Italy.</v>

47
00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.853
<v Speaker 1>There are lots of people who speak </v>
<v Speaker 1>original language at home or with their </v>

48
00:02:22.411 --> 00:02:23.244
<v Speaker 1>close friends,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but with people who are less familiar </v>

49
00:02:24.961 --> 00:02:27.600
<v Speaker 1>and informal situations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they speak standard Italian.</v>

50
00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:28.613
<v Speaker 1>Another example is the German language,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which has one high variety standard </v>

51
00:02:31.621 --> 00:02:35.070
<v Speaker 1>German and many different low varieties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Inside Germany.</v>

52
00:02:35.071 --> 00:02:38.400
<v Speaker 1>A lot of the low varieties have </v>
<v Speaker 1>disappeared or are starting to fade,</v>

53
00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.860
<v Speaker 1>but one interesting example is in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Switzerland,</v>

54
00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:41.830
<v Speaker 1>in Switzerland,</v>
<v Speaker 1>die.</v>

55
00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:42.673
<v Speaker 1>Glossier is almost entirely a </v>
<v Speaker 1>distinction between spoken </v>

56
00:02:45.151 --> 00:02:45.984
<v Speaker 1>communication.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On the one hand and writing on the </v>

57
00:02:47.641 --> 00:02:48.474
<v Speaker 1>other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People in Switzerland don't really </v>

58
00:02:49.411 --> 00:02:52.200
<v Speaker 1>accept the idea of their dialects being </v>
<v Speaker 1>a low variety,</v>

59
00:02:52.201 --> 00:02:55.140
<v Speaker 1>so they tend to use their dialects in </v>
<v Speaker 1>all spoken situations,</v>

60
00:02:55.141 --> 00:02:55.974
<v Speaker 1>even in formal situations and standard </v>
<v Speaker 1>German is used only for reading and </v>

61
00:02:59.081 --> 00:02:59.914
<v Speaker 1>writing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For people who grew up with no real </v>

62
00:03:01.241 --> 00:03:05.380
<v Speaker 1>distinction between a low variety and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the high variety die glossier might seem</v>

63
00:03:05.381 --> 00:03:08.440
<v Speaker 1>like a bizarre situation that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>difficult to wrap their head around,</v>

64
00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:12.370
<v Speaker 1>but languages and the way we use them </v>
<v Speaker 1>are fascinating and full of mystery.</v>

65
00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:13.383
<v Speaker 1>The concept of Dye Glossy as one that </v>
<v Speaker 1>will definitely come up in a lot of my </v>

66
00:03:15.881 --> 00:03:16.630
<v Speaker 1>future videos.</v>

67
00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:18.700
<v Speaker 1>So I wanted to make a quick little video</v>
<v Speaker 1>about it.</v>

68
00:03:18.701 --> 00:03:22.690
<v Speaker 1>So you're familiar with the concept.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I want to take a moment to say thank</v>

69
00:03:22.691 --> 00:03:23.524
<v Speaker 1>you to all of the people who have </v>
<v Speaker 1>supported me on Patrion so far because </v>

70
00:03:26.351 --> 00:03:27.184
<v Speaker 1>that is a tremendous help to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It really helps me justify the huge </v>

71
00:03:29.471 --> 00:03:31.810
<v Speaker 1>amount of time that I invest in this </v>
<v Speaker 1>channel.</v>

72
00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:34.600
<v Speaker 1>If you find lang focus and it's video is</v>
<v Speaker 1>valuable,</v>

73
00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:35.463
<v Speaker 1>the main thing that you can do to </v>
<v Speaker 1>support the channel is to make a pledge </v>

74
00:03:37.901 --> 00:03:39.150
<v Speaker 1>on Patrion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

75
00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:40.053
<v Speaker 1>even if it's just a small amount of one </v>
<v Speaker 1>or $2 or something that adds up and it </v>

76
00:03:43.151 --> 00:03:45.310
<v Speaker 1>becomes a significant help to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>channel.</v>

77
00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:46.503
<v Speaker 1>Some other people have asked me how they</v>
<v Speaker 1>can make a onetime donation rather than </v>

78
00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:53.650
<v Speaker 1>making a monthly pledge on Patriarchy </v>
<v Speaker 1>and if you look at my channel page,</v>

79
00:03:53.651 --> 00:03:55.540
<v Speaker 1>you will see a blue support button.</v>

80
00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:56.553
<v Speaker 1>If you click on that button,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a way to make a onetime donation </v>

81
00:03:58.961 --> 00:03:59.794
<v Speaker 1>to the channel through youtube directly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some of you are unable to support the </v>

82
00:04:02.561 --> 00:04:03.394
<v Speaker 1>channel with money and that's okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there are other ways that you can </v>

83
00:04:05.621 --> 00:04:06.454
<v Speaker 1>support the channel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can support the channel by sharing </v>

84
00:04:08.771 --> 00:04:12.370
<v Speaker 1>videos on facebook or by tweeting my </v>
<v Speaker 1>videos when they're released.</v>

85
00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:13.233
<v Speaker 1>That's a big help as well and there </v>
<v Speaker 1>might be a few of you who want to do </v>

86
00:04:15.371 --> 00:04:18.070
<v Speaker 1>something more significant to help out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If that's you,</v>

87
00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:21.820
<v Speaker 1>then one possibility is for you to help </v>
<v Speaker 1>out with the Geo focus channel.</v>

88
00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:25.510
<v Speaker 1>If you would like to volunteer some of </v>
<v Speaker 1>your time to do some research or writing</v>

89
00:04:25.511 --> 00:04:27.850
<v Speaker 1>for some of my videos on the Geo focus </v>
<v Speaker 1>channel,</v>

90
00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:28.833
<v Speaker 1>then that's a possibility as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you're inexperienced editor and </v>

91
00:04:31.391 --> 00:04:34.510
<v Speaker 1>you would like to do some editing work </v>
<v Speaker 1>on some of the geo focus videos,</v>

92
00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:37.270
<v Speaker 1>then we can be in contact.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And discuss that as well.</v>

93
00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:38.163
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to do that with the lang focus</v>
<v Speaker 1>channel because the videos are so </v>

94
00:04:40.511 --> 00:04:42.880
<v Speaker 1>complex and I like to be in complete </v>
<v Speaker 1>control of them.</v>

95
00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.040
<v Speaker 1>But for Geo focused,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a little bit easier.</v>

96
00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:46.053
<v Speaker 1>So if you would like to support Lang </v>
<v Speaker 1>Focus and geo focus in any of those </v>

97
00:04:48.881 --> 00:04:49.714
<v Speaker 1>ways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then that would be great and I would be </v>

98
00:04:50.561 --> 00:04:52.330
<v Speaker 1>very grateful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But in the meantime,</v>

99
00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:53.193
<v Speaker 1>I appreciate your viewership.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank you for watching and have a nice </v>

100
00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:56.310
<v Speaker 1>day</v>

101
00:04:56.310 --> 00:05:01.310
<v Speaker 2>dish.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh.</v>
