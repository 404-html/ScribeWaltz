00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:02.143
<v Speaker 1>Hi there.</v>

2
00:00:02.390 --> 00:00:03.223
<v Speaker 2>Licensee,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Deutsche,</v>

3
00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:04.630
<v Speaker 2>Deutsche.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

4
00:00:04.631 --> 00:00:05.920
<v Speaker 2>sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't speak Dutch.</v>

5
00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:11.150
<v Speaker 2>Hello language,</v>
<v Speaker 2>enthusiastic.</v>

6
00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:14.090
<v Speaker 2>Welcome to the Lange Focus Channel and </v>
<v Speaker 2>my name is Paul.</v>

7
00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:17.270
<v Speaker 2>Today I'm going to talk about the German</v>
<v Speaker 2>language.</v>

8
00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:21.410
<v Speaker 2>German is a very important language that</v>
<v Speaker 2>deserves all of our attention.</v>

9
00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:26.090
<v Speaker 2>It is spoken by $95 million native </v>
<v Speaker 2>speakers mainly in central Europe,</v>

10
00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:30.680
<v Speaker 2>but it's also spoken by an additional 10</v>
<v Speaker 2>to $15 million second language speakers,</v>

11
00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:31.753
<v Speaker 2>especially in eastern Europe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is the majority language and an </v>

12
00:00:34.641 --> 00:00:37.610
<v Speaker 2>official language in Germany of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but also Austria,</v>

13
00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:40.520
<v Speaker 2>Switzerland,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Liechtenstein and the south tyrol region</v>

14
00:00:40.521 --> 00:00:41.354
<v Speaker 2>of northern Italy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's also an official language in </v>

15
00:00:43.131 --> 00:00:46.160
<v Speaker 2>Luxembourg and Belgium,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's not a majority language there.</v>

16
00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:49.910
<v Speaker 2>German is the most widely spoken </v>
<v Speaker 2>language in the European Union.</v>

17
00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.893
<v Speaker 2>It is also one of the most widely taught</v>
<v Speaker 2>languages in the world with between 75 </v>

18
00:00:54.681 --> 00:00:55.514
<v Speaker 2>and 100 million people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Having studied it as a foreign language </v>

19
00:00:58.070 --> 00:00:58.903
<v Speaker 2>in both the United States and in Europe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is the third most widely taught </v>

20
00:01:02.061 --> 00:01:02.900
<v Speaker 2>foreign language.</v>

21
00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:07.370
<v Speaker 2>Did you know that one 10th of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world's books are published in German.</v>

22
00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:11.120
<v Speaker 2>German is also the second most widely </v>
<v Speaker 2>used scientific language.</v>

23
00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:15.050
<v Speaker 2>I know some doctors and all of them have</v>
<v Speaker 2>some reading knowledge of German because</v>

24
00:01:15.051 --> 00:01:17.660
<v Speaker 2>so much scientific research has </v>
<v Speaker 2>documented in German,</v>

25
00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:20.960
<v Speaker 2>so are you starting to get an idea of </v>
<v Speaker 2>why German is important?</v>

26
00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:25.400
<v Speaker 2>German is a member of the West Germanic </v>
<v Speaker 2>language family,</v>

27
00:01:25.401 --> 00:01:27.890
<v Speaker 2>which also includes Dutch,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Africans,</v>

28
00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:29.930
<v Speaker 2>Friesian,</v>
<v Speaker 2>English and Yiddish.</v>

29
00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:33.830
<v Speaker 2>The West Germanic languages are part of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the wider Germanic language family.</v>

30
00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:36.980
<v Speaker 2>So let's take a look at the origins of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the dramatic language family.</v>

31
00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:38.421
<v Speaker 2>Wait,</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually no,</v>

32
00:01:38.421 --> 00:01:39.254
<v Speaker 2>I did this in my last video,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I'm just going to play that part </v>

33
00:01:41.841 --> 00:01:44.390
<v Speaker 2>again while I go get a coffee and I'll </v>
<v Speaker 2>be right back.</v>

34
00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:47.450
<v Speaker 2>All Germanic languages developed from </v>
<v Speaker 2>Provo Germanic,</v>

35
00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:48.313
<v Speaker 2>which was spoken around 500 bce.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Protoje dramatic possibly originated in </v>

36
00:01:52.251 --> 00:01:53.084
<v Speaker 2>Scandinavia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and different varieties of Germanic </v>

37
00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:55.903
<v Speaker 2>began to emerge with migration.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Runic inscriptions from the second </v>

38
00:01:58.851 --> 00:01:59.684
<v Speaker 2>century ce show us that by that time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pro dramatic had began to separate into </v>

39
00:02:03.501 --> 00:02:06.350
<v Speaker 2>distinct western,</v>
<v Speaker 2>eastern and northern dialects.</v>

40
00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:09.911
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sorry.</v>

41
00:02:09.911 --> 00:02:11.170
<v Speaker 1>Are you guys waiting for me?</v>

42
00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:13.140
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's move on.</v>

43
00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:14.363
<v Speaker 2>The West dramatic dialects were probably</v>
<v Speaker 2>closely related enough to be mutually </v>

44
00:02:17.431 --> 00:02:20.070
<v Speaker 2>intelligible until about the eighth </v>
<v Speaker 2>century ce,</v>

45
00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:24.000
<v Speaker 2>but at that time something was happening</v>
<v Speaker 2>that would split their dramatic language</v>

46
00:02:24.001 --> 00:02:27.300
<v Speaker 2>family and give birth to the German </v>
<v Speaker 2>language as we know it today.</v>

47
00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:31.950
<v Speaker 2>That was the hydromatic sounds shift or </v>
<v Speaker 2>the hydromatic continental shift.</v>

48
00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:36.060
<v Speaker 2>Some west Germanic varieties underwent a</v>
<v Speaker 2>number of sound changes,</v>

49
00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:37.073
<v Speaker 2>nine consonants changed to be precise </v>
<v Speaker 2>and this created two distinct groups of </v>

50
00:02:40.921 --> 00:02:41.754
<v Speaker 2>Germanic dialect,</v>
<v Speaker 2>high German or Deutsche and low German </v>

51
00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:49.440
<v Speaker 2>or plot doidge and just out of interest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let me pronounce these words a different</v>

52
00:02:49.441 --> 00:02:51.850
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>High Deutsche and flat,</v>

53
00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:52.803
<v Speaker 2>which maybe there's a connection with </v>
<v Speaker 2>English high German dialects arose in </v>

54
00:02:56.581 --> 00:02:59.680
<v Speaker 2>the southern areas of Germany which are </v>
<v Speaker 2>at a higher elevation.</v>

55
00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:00.543
<v Speaker 2>That's why they're called hydrogen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The low German dialects existed in the </v>

56
00:03:03.671 --> 00:03:07.300
<v Speaker 2>northern part of Germany at a lower </v>
<v Speaker 2>elevation and also in the Netherlands.</v>

57
00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:09.910
<v Speaker 2>These terms do not refer to high end low</v>
<v Speaker 2>status,</v>

58
00:03:09.911 --> 00:03:12.790
<v Speaker 2>but rather to the elevation of the areas</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were spoken in,</v>

59
00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:16.330
<v Speaker 2>hydrogen can be further subdivided into </v>
<v Speaker 2>two segments,</v>

60
00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:20.440
<v Speaker 2>upper German and central German.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what were the sound changes that took</v>

61
00:03:20.441 --> 00:03:21.071
<v Speaker 2>place?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

62
00:03:21.071 --> 00:03:21.904
<v Speaker 2>let's take a look.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These consonant changes took place in </v>

63
00:03:23.981 --> 00:03:25.900
<v Speaker 2>three stages.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In the first stage,</v>

64
00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:28.260
<v Speaker 2>these consonants changed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Interval calendly,</v>

65
00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:32.810
<v Speaker 2>that means between vowel sounds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the p sound that became a foot,</v>

66
00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:37.980
<v Speaker 2>this to sound became a sub,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the sound became a cup.</v>

67
00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:40.720
<v Speaker 2>Here's an example for the English word.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For Sleep.</v>

68
00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:45.930
<v Speaker 2>In Low German it's sloppy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in German it's in the second stage.</v>

69
00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:47.703
<v Speaker 2>These continents changed at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>beginning of a word and also in some </v>

70
00:03:50.201 --> 00:03:51.034
<v Speaker 2>other context,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like if they are the second letter in a </v>

71
00:03:53.171 --> 00:03:54.004
<v Speaker 2>double consonant or after an l or an r </v>
<v Speaker 2>sound book became per foot like a p and </v>

72
00:03:59.430 --> 00:03:59.800
<v Speaker 2>an f.</v>

73
00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:00.633
<v Speaker 2>together the sound became a son.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It sounds like a ts sound even though </v>

74
00:04:04.961 --> 00:04:09.961
<v Speaker 2>it's written with a z and the sound </v>
<v Speaker 2>became a like a k sound followed by cup.</v>

75
00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:13.270
<v Speaker 2>Here's an example for the English word </v>
<v Speaker 2>Tame.</v>

76
00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:16.770
<v Speaker 2>In lower German it's tem,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in high German it's,</v>

77
00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:20.080
<v Speaker 2>I'm in the third stage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Three more consonants changed.</v>

78
00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:21.123
<v Speaker 2>The book sound became a Po that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>sound became a ta in the sound became a </v>

79
00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:26.453
<v Speaker 2>CCO.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's an example for the English word </v>

80
00:04:27.971 --> 00:04:30.520
<v Speaker 2>for day in lower German,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's f,</v>

81
00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:31.683
<v Speaker 2>but in high German it's talk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now all of these sound changes took </v>

82
00:04:34.781 --> 00:04:36.640
<v Speaker 2>place in upper German,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the south,</v>

83
00:04:36.641 --> 00:04:37.474
<v Speaker 2>but some of them didn't take place in </v>
<v Speaker 2>central German and some of them didn't </v>

84
00:04:40.151 --> 00:04:40.984
<v Speaker 2>take place in standard German,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we'll get to standard German in a </v>

85
00:04:43.601 --> 00:04:45.370
<v Speaker 2>minute.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So some of you might be thinking,</v>

86
00:04:45.371 --> 00:04:47.440
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how did these sounds just switch.</v>

87
00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:49.240
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they didn't instantly switch.</v>

88
00:04:49.241 --> 00:04:52.180
<v Speaker 2>They gradually changed over a period of </v>
<v Speaker 2>a few centuries,</v>

89
00:04:52.181 --> 00:04:56.590
<v Speaker 2>probably between the fifth century and </v>
<v Speaker 2>18th century ce over the centuries,</v>

90
00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:57.453
<v Speaker 2>the dialect continuum of low German had </v>
<v Speaker 2>high German grew more and more distinct </v>

91
00:05:00.971 --> 00:05:04.060
<v Speaker 2>until there were varieties that were </v>
<v Speaker 2>quite incomprehensible,</v>

92
00:05:04.061 --> 00:05:04.894
<v Speaker 2>so someone from the south in Bavaria </v>
<v Speaker 2>would have trouble communicating with </v>

93
00:05:07.601 --> 00:05:08.434
<v Speaker 2>someone from Hamburg in the north.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But of course that was before standard </v>

94
00:05:11.411 --> 00:05:12.244
<v Speaker 2>German.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The dialects of low German are often </v>

95
00:05:13.721 --> 00:05:14.554
<v Speaker 2>said to be a separate language from high</v>
<v Speaker 2>German and there are often sent to be </v>

96
00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:18.363
<v Speaker 2>halfway between high German and Dutch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now the low German dialect actually </v>

97
00:05:21.851 --> 00:05:22.684
<v Speaker 2>crosses the border into the eastern part</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the Netherlands where low German has </v>

98
00:05:25.531 --> 00:05:26.364
<v Speaker 2>also spoken,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but these days the low German dialects </v>

99
00:05:28.481 --> 00:05:29.314
<v Speaker 2>in the north of the country are mostly </v>
<v Speaker 2>fading and basically only older people </v>

100
00:05:32.711 --> 00:05:35.020
<v Speaker 2>speak them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Younger people might understand them,</v>

101
00:05:35.021 --> 00:05:37.270
<v Speaker 2>but they tend to use standard German </v>
<v Speaker 2>instead,</v>

102
00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:39.880
<v Speaker 2>but when did standard German come into </v>
<v Speaker 2>the picture?</v>

103
00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:41.013
<v Speaker 2>Standard German,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which by the way is also called </v>

104
00:05:42.671 --> 00:05:43.504
<v Speaker 2>Hochdeutsch in German,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so don't be confused between hydrogen </v>

105
00:05:45.521 --> 00:05:46.354
<v Speaker 2>and standard German,</v>
<v Speaker 2>originated as a written literary </v>

106
00:05:48.761 --> 00:05:49.594
<v Speaker 2>language that developed over a few </v>
<v Speaker 2>hundred years as writers tried to write </v>

107
00:05:52.601 --> 00:05:53.434
<v Speaker 2>in a way that would be understood by the</v>
<v Speaker 2>largest number of people possible from </v>

108
00:05:56.320 --> 00:06:00.050
<v Speaker 2>different dialect areas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but perhaps the most important factor in</v>

109
00:06:00.051 --> 00:06:03.860
<v Speaker 2>the development of standard German was </v>
<v Speaker 2>the translation of the Bible into German</v>

110
00:06:03.861 --> 00:06:06.620
<v Speaker 2>by Martin Luther in the year 15,</v>
<v Speaker 2>22.</v>

111
00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:10.550
<v Speaker 2>He based his translation on the sex in </v>
<v Speaker 2>dialect of central German,</v>

112
00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:13.760
<v Speaker 2>while including some vocabulary from </v>
<v Speaker 2>other dialects as well.</v>

113
00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:14.773
<v Speaker 2>Virtually all speakers of German </v>
<v Speaker 2>dialects owned a copy of the new Bible </v>

114
00:06:17.601 --> 00:06:21.320
<v Speaker 2>and studied it effectively popularizing </v>
<v Speaker 2>this form of written German.</v>

115
00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:25.370
<v Speaker 2>Originally there was no single way to </v>
<v Speaker 2>pronounce this written form of German,</v>

116
00:06:25.371 --> 00:06:29.900
<v Speaker 2>but eventually the dialect of Hanover </v>
<v Speaker 2>became the standard for pronunciation of</v>

117
00:06:29.901 --> 00:06:30.734
<v Speaker 2>standard German.</v>

118
00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:36.763
<v Speaker 2>Standard German includes some of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>sounds of the High German continental </v>

119
00:06:39.471 --> 00:06:40.304
<v Speaker 2>shift,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but not all of them because it was </v>

120
00:06:41.721 --> 00:06:42.554
<v Speaker 2>influenced by the dialect of Hanover,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so standard German began as a written </v>

121
00:06:45.921 --> 00:06:46.754
<v Speaker 2>language,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but as it became the language of </v>

122
00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:48.913
<v Speaker 2>education,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it became more widespread as the formal </v>

123
00:06:50.901 --> 00:06:54.080
<v Speaker 2>spoken language and it also influenced </v>
<v Speaker 2>the local dialects.</v>

124
00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:55.063
<v Speaker 2>Today,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pretty much everyone can speak standard </v>

125
00:06:56.451 --> 00:06:57.284
<v Speaker 2>German,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even if they speak a local dialect </v>

126
00:06:58.761 --> 00:06:59.594
<v Speaker 2>casually and many local dialects have </v>
<v Speaker 2>become largely replaced by standard </v>

127
00:07:02.961 --> 00:07:03.794
<v Speaker 2>German,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially the low German dialects in </v>

128
00:07:05.271 --> 00:07:06.104
<v Speaker 2>the north of the country,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there are still some dialects that </v>

129
00:07:08.061 --> 00:07:08.894
<v Speaker 2>are quite distinct and still thriving </v>
<v Speaker 2>like the Bavarian dialect in the South </v>

130
00:07:12.410 --> 00:07:15.320
<v Speaker 2>East German is considered a plurry </v>
<v Speaker 2>centric language.</v>

131
00:07:15.321 --> 00:07:18.770
<v Speaker 2>That means that there are multiple </v>
<v Speaker 2>standard varieties of the language.</v>

132
00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:20.990
<v Speaker 2>There is one standard language in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Germany,</v>

133
00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:21.973
<v Speaker 2>one in Australia and one in Switzerland.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All of these standard varieties are </v>

134
00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:28.100
<v Speaker 2>pretty much the same except for some </v>
<v Speaker 2>differing vocabulary,</v>

135
00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:29.233
<v Speaker 2>but of course those are the standard </v>
<v Speaker 2>language of Switzerland and Austria and </v>

136
00:07:31.761 --> 00:07:34.370
<v Speaker 2>also south to roll,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is related to Austria,</v>

137
00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:36.350
<v Speaker 2>have their own dialects as well.</v>

138
00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:37.633
<v Speaker 2>The Austrian dialects or related to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Bavarian dialects in South East Germany </v>

139
00:07:41.090 --> 00:07:41.923
<v Speaker 2>and the Swiss dialects are related to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the element of dialects in southwest </v>

140
00:07:45.021 --> 00:07:45.854
<v Speaker 2>Germany.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe you saw my video about the </v>

141
00:07:47.391 --> 00:07:48.224
<v Speaker 2>languages of Switzerland.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's this one right here and in that </v>

142
00:07:50.871 --> 00:07:51.704
<v Speaker 2>video I talked about how the Swiss </v>
<v Speaker 2>German dialects are kind of </v>

143
00:07:54.110 --> 00:07:59.110
<v Speaker 2>incomprehensible to speakers of standard</v>
<v Speaker 2>German unless they also speak in dialect</v>

144
00:07:59.631 --> 00:08:00.464
<v Speaker 2>from the border area,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but of course that's talking about the </v>

145
00:08:02.691 --> 00:08:03.524
<v Speaker 2>Swiss German dialects.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Swiss Germans can speak standard German </v>

146
00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:09.050
<v Speaker 2>even if they tend to use it less than </v>
<v Speaker 2>people in Germany.</v>

147
00:08:09.470 --> 00:08:12.410
<v Speaker 2>Of course they might pronounce standard </v>
<v Speaker 2>German with a different accent,</v>

148
00:08:12.411 --> 00:08:15.370
<v Speaker 2>but that's no big deal in Austria and </v>
<v Speaker 2>south to roll.</v>

149
00:08:15.380 --> 00:08:18.530
<v Speaker 2>The situation is similar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are dialects that might be hard to</v>

150
00:08:18.531 --> 00:08:21.590
<v Speaker 2>understand for people from some other </v>
<v Speaker 2>German speaking countries,</v>

151
00:08:21.591 --> 00:08:23.900
<v Speaker 2>but of course standard German is the </v>
<v Speaker 2>bridge.</v>

152
00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:26.730
<v Speaker 2>These countries are all part of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>German sprocket,</v>

153
00:08:26.740 --> 00:08:27.320
<v Speaker 2>Rome.</v>

154
00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:28.153
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So which means the geographic area over </v>

155
00:08:30.531 --> 00:08:31.364
<v Speaker 2>which that language is spoken,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and within that sprocket round standard </v>

156
00:08:34.371 --> 00:08:36.650
<v Speaker 2>German is the doc sprocket.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That profit,</v>

157
00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:37.673
<v Speaker 2>that means the umbrella language under </v>
<v Speaker 2>which all of those dialects can come </v>

158
00:08:40.671 --> 00:08:43.600
<v Speaker 2>together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those two German terms I just used brock</v>

159
00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:48.380
<v Speaker 2>and are common linguistic terms and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>think that shows just how much influence</v>

160
00:08:48.381 --> 00:08:52.430
<v Speaker 2>the German language has over academic </v>
<v Speaker 2>areas of research like linguistics.</v>

161
00:08:52.550 --> 00:08:54.470
<v Speaker 2>So what is the German language like?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

162
00:08:54.471 --> 00:08:55.304
<v Speaker 2>it's closely related to English,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is obvious when we look at the </v>

163
00:08:57.691 --> 00:09:00.120
<v Speaker 2>most basic sentences.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's an example.</v>

164
00:09:00.420 --> 00:09:01.770
<v Speaker 2>I buy books often.</v>

165
00:09:02.300 --> 00:09:05.900
<v Speaker 3>It's cold for whole fish booster.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Each cow,</v>

166
00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:08.280
<v Speaker 3>Hoy who shot</v>

167
00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:11.260
<v Speaker 2>hear the word order is Svo,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like in English,</v>

168
00:09:11.290 --> 00:09:15.130
<v Speaker 2>except that the adverb comes before the </v>
<v Speaker 2>object instead of after it.</v>

169
00:09:15.580 --> 00:09:17.680
<v Speaker 2>Here's another example with an important</v>
<v Speaker 2>twist.</v>

170
00:09:17.950 --> 00:09:19.480
<v Speaker 2>I will buy the book today.</v>

171
00:09:19.790 --> 00:09:23.590
<v Speaker 3>You've added a spool quite often each </v>
<v Speaker 3>voucher,</v>

172
00:09:23.660 --> 00:09:25.810
<v Speaker 3>just calvin.</v>

173
00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:26.913
<v Speaker 2>In this case,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we see one of the most confusing things </v>

174
00:09:28.481 --> 00:09:29.314
<v Speaker 2>for learners of German,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is the placement of the second </v>

175
00:09:31.091 --> 00:09:31.924
<v Speaker 2>verb at the end of the sentence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if there's a helping verb like will </v>

176
00:09:35.110 --> 00:09:38.320
<v Speaker 2>or voucher,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is in the normal Svo position,</v>

177
00:09:38.350 --> 00:09:41.350
<v Speaker 2>but the main verb goes at the end.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Another example,</v>

178
00:09:41.410 --> 00:09:42.610
<v Speaker 2>the book was interesting</v>

179
00:09:43.150 --> 00:09:48.150
<v Speaker 3>just via to the sun does va into the </v>
<v Speaker 3>sand.</v>

180
00:09:49.510 --> 00:09:52.450
<v Speaker 2>And one more example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like people who work hard</v>

181
00:09:53.220 --> 00:09:56.410
<v Speaker 3>ish.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mark mentioned to your hot button issue,</v>

182
00:09:56.640 --> 00:10:00.570
<v Speaker 3>mark mentioned the heart operation.</v>

183
00:10:01.990 --> 00:10:02.823
<v Speaker 2>Another thing that learners have German </v>
<v Speaker 2>find challenging is the case system in </v>

184
00:10:06.041 --> 00:10:06.874
<v Speaker 2>German,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in German pronouns and nouns changed </v>

185
00:10:08.861 --> 00:10:11.080
<v Speaker 2>form depending on their function in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>sentence,</v>

186
00:10:11.081 --> 00:10:14.740
<v Speaker 2>but along with them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the articles and adjectives also change.</v>

187
00:10:15.100 --> 00:10:19.150
<v Speaker 2>Here's an example of German grammatical </v>
<v Speaker 2>cases using the now meaning table,</v>

188
00:10:19.540 --> 00:10:24.540
<v Speaker 3>the acting dean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Trish just deem Tisha did.</v>

189
00:10:25.300 --> 00:10:26.890
<v Speaker 3>Tisha,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tisha,</v>

190
00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:28.073
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sure.</v>

191
00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:31.093
<v Speaker 2>You can see that the change takes place </v>
<v Speaker 2>not only in the noun but also in the </v>

192
00:10:33.921 --> 00:10:34.754
<v Speaker 2>definite article as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The word for table is a masculine nouns </v>

193
00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:38.473
<v Speaker 2>in German,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there are actually three genders in </v>

194
00:10:40.281 --> 00:10:41.780
<v Speaker 2>German.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are masculine nouns,</v>

195
00:10:41.781 --> 00:10:44.540
<v Speaker 2>feminine nouns and Neuter Nouns,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and for each of them,</v>

196
00:10:44.570 --> 00:10:45.403
<v Speaker 2>the case forms are different,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and all of these different forms also </v>

197
00:10:48.291 --> 00:10:51.230
<v Speaker 2>apply to adjectives which drives </v>
<v Speaker 2>learners crazy.</v>

198
00:10:51.500 --> 00:10:54.080
<v Speaker 2>So while German is closely related to </v>
<v Speaker 2>English,</v>

199
00:10:54.110 --> 00:10:54.943
<v Speaker 2>the devil is in the details,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even though most of the other Germanic </v>

200
00:10:57.501 --> 00:10:59.870
<v Speaker 2>languages are classified as category </v>
<v Speaker 2>one.</v>

201
00:10:59.871 --> 00:11:03.920
<v Speaker 2>Languages by the Fsi,</v>
<v Speaker 2>German is classified as category two,</v>

202
00:11:04.190 --> 00:11:05.023
<v Speaker 2>it's closely related to English and they</v>
<v Speaker 2>have a lot in common in terms of the </v>

203
00:11:07.581 --> 00:11:11.630
<v Speaker 2>general syntax and vocabulary,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when it comes to the fine details of</v>

204
00:11:11.631 --> 00:11:13.730
<v Speaker 2>grammar,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are some challenges for learners,</v>

205
00:11:13.850 --> 00:11:16.310
<v Speaker 2>but as always,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you are interested in German speaking</v>

206
00:11:16.340 --> 00:11:19.130
<v Speaker 2>cultures and countries,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or if you would like to benefit from the</v>

207
00:11:19.131 --> 00:11:22.580
<v Speaker 2>widespread use of German,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then don't hesitate to start learning.</v>

208
00:11:22.820 --> 00:11:26.320
<v Speaker 2>All challenges become adventures when </v>
<v Speaker 2>you become fascinated.</v>

209
00:11:26.390 --> 00:11:27.223
<v Speaker 2>The question of the day German speakers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you think there's anything unique or </v>

210
00:11:29.901 --> 00:11:30.734
<v Speaker 2>special or interesting about your local </v>
<v Speaker 2>variety of German and how do other </v>

211
00:11:34.161 --> 00:11:34.994
<v Speaker 2>varieties of German sound to you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let us know in the comments down below </v>

212
00:11:37.670 --> 00:11:40.070
<v Speaker 2>and everyone else jump in and let's </v>
<v Speaker 2>discuss.</v>

213
00:11:40.310 --> 00:11:42.220
<v Speaker 2>Thank you for watching and have a nice.</v>
