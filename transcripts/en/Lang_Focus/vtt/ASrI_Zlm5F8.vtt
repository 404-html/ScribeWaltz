00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:01.233
<v Speaker 1>Hello everyone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>welcome to the Lange Focus Channel and </v>

2
00:00:03.431 --> 00:00:04.264
<v Speaker 1>my name is Paul.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Today we're going to talk about a </v>

3
00:00:06.671 --> 00:00:11.200
<v Speaker 1>language that partially descended from </v>
<v Speaker 1>English but is not actually English.</v>

4
00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:16.270
<v Speaker 1>The language is took piece in an English</v>
<v Speaker 1>based Creole language talk.</v>

5
00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:19.450
<v Speaker 1>BCM is one of the official languages of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Papa New Guinea,</v>

6
00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:22.330
<v Speaker 1>which is located in the southwestern </v>
<v Speaker 1>Pacific Ocean,</v>

7
00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:23.343
<v Speaker 1>just north of Australia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's other official languages are </v>

8
00:00:25.841 --> 00:00:26.674
<v Speaker 1>English,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is not spoken by most of the </v>

9
00:00:28.151 --> 00:00:28.984
<v Speaker 1>population and hedy Motu,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but talk piecing serves as the most </v>

10
00:00:31.931 --> 00:00:32.764
<v Speaker 1>common Lingua Franca.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lingua Franca is certainly useful in </v>

11
00:00:36.011 --> 00:00:36.844
<v Speaker 1>Papa New Guinea since it's the most </v>
<v Speaker 1>linguistically diverse country on the </v>

12
00:00:39.821 --> 00:00:40.654
<v Speaker 1>planet.</v>

13
00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:46.973
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the most linguistically diverse </v>

14
00:00:48.301 --> 00:00:49.134
<v Speaker 1>country in the whole universe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Over 800 languages are spoken in Papa </v>

15
00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:56.423
<v Speaker 1>New Guinea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a country of just around 8 million </v>

16
00:00:57.571 --> 00:01:00.480
<v Speaker 1>people with so much linguistic </v>
<v Speaker 1>diversity.</v>

17
00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:01.343
<v Speaker 1>Talk piecing is frequently used for </v>
<v Speaker 1>communication between people of </v>

18
00:01:03.871 --> 00:01:08.070
<v Speaker 1>different linguistic backgrounds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at the name of the language.</v>

19
00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:08.933
<v Speaker 1>Talk pc talk means language,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it comes from the English word talk </v>

20
00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.550
<v Speaker 1>and also means talk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>speech,</v>

21
00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:15.690
<v Speaker 1>word,</v>
<v Speaker 1>message,</v>

22
00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:16.740
<v Speaker 1>news,</v>
<v Speaker 1>etc.</v>

23
00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.650
<v Speaker 1>The majority of top piss in words come </v>
<v Speaker 1>from english,</v>

24
00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.160
<v Speaker 1>but are used with different meanings or </v>
<v Speaker 1>with a wider range of meanings.</v>

25
00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:24.113
<v Speaker 1>This word piecing comes from pigeon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but probably developed from the english </v>

26
00:01:27.421 --> 00:01:29.630
<v Speaker 1>word business,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not in [inaudible],</v>

27
00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:30.503
<v Speaker 1>but rather in the chinese language talk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pc has also sometimes been called talk </v>

28
00:01:34.501 --> 00:01:36.690
<v Speaker 1>boy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>boy comes from boy,</v>

29
00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.990
<v Speaker 1>but actually refers to someone who was </v>
<v Speaker 1>an indentured laborer,</v>

30
00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:45.020
<v Speaker 1>servant or slave of colonial europeans </v>
<v Speaker 1>because their bosses or masters referred</v>

31
00:01:45.381 --> 00:01:46.214
<v Speaker 1>to them as boy talk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pissing began as a pigeon language on </v>

32
00:01:48.961 --> 00:01:53.961
<v Speaker 1>the plantations of german Samoa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Between 1880 and 1914 when laborers from</v>

33
00:01:54.391 --> 00:01:58.890
<v Speaker 1>new Guinea were brought over an english </v>
<v Speaker 1>based creole in a german territory.</v>

34
00:01:59.040 --> 00:01:59.873
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well laborers from the Solomon Islands </v>

35
00:02:02.071 --> 00:02:06.000
<v Speaker 1>and from Vanuatu had already been </v>
<v Speaker 1>working on plantations in the queensland</v>

36
00:02:06.001 --> 00:02:06.834
<v Speaker 1>colony in present day Australia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they had already developed an </v>

37
00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:11.220
<v Speaker 1>english based pigeon language.</v>

38
00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:15.840
<v Speaker 1>In short,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they needed a common language for work,</v>

39
00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:16.703
<v Speaker 1>so they adopted a small english </v>
<v Speaker 1>vocabulary and use the grammar of their </v>

40
00:02:19.651 --> 00:02:22.080
<v Speaker 1>melanesian languages to connect the </v>
<v Speaker 1>words together.</v>

41
00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:23.603
<v Speaker 1>In this way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a melanesian english based creole </v>

42
00:02:25.381 --> 00:02:28.330
<v Speaker 1>language overall is in queensland.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some of these pigeons,</v>

43
00:02:28.331 --> 00:02:29.164
<v Speaker 1>speakers from Vanuatu,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Solomon Islands later worked in german </v>

44
00:02:31.741 --> 00:02:32.574
<v Speaker 1>Samoa alongside the new Guinea and </v>
<v Speaker 1>laborers using their pigeon as a lingua </v>

45
00:02:35.791 --> 00:02:36.624
<v Speaker 1>franca.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People from all of these places brought </v>

46
00:02:38.611 --> 00:02:42.510
<v Speaker 1>the pigeon language home with them where</v>
<v Speaker 1>it became widely used as a lingua franca</v>

47
00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:43.373
<v Speaker 1>and became crystallized,</v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning that it became spoken as a </v>

48
00:02:45.781 --> 00:02:49.620
<v Speaker 1>native language for some people and </v>
<v Speaker 1>became used for all functions of life,</v>

49
00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:53.040
<v Speaker 1>not only for the limited functions of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the original pigeon language.</v>

50
00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:54.203
<v Speaker 1>Till this day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the forms of pigeon spoken in papa new </v>

51
00:02:56.071 --> 00:03:00.010
<v Speaker 1>Guinea and the Solomon Islands and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Vanuatu are all quite though.</v>

52
00:03:00.011 --> 00:03:03.460
<v Speaker 1>They have definitely diverged into their</v>
<v Speaker 1>own distinct varieties.</v>

53
00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:06.520
<v Speaker 1>After pigeon languages become creole </v>
<v Speaker 1>languages,</v>

54
00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:09.130
<v Speaker 1>there are technically no longer pidgin </v>
<v Speaker 1>languages,</v>

55
00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:12.130
<v Speaker 1>but they are still referred to as pigeon</v>
<v Speaker 1>in all three countries.</v>

56
00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:16.120
<v Speaker 1>Now let's examine talk pcn and see what </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like.</v>

57
00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:19.960
<v Speaker 1>Vocabulary as an english based creole </v>
<v Speaker 1>language talk,</v>

58
00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:22.630
<v Speaker 1>pcn got most of its vocabulary from </v>
<v Speaker 1>english,</v>

59
00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:23.493
<v Speaker 1>but words of english origin are usually </v>
<v Speaker 1>pronounced differently according to the </v>

60
00:03:26.531 --> 00:03:30.040
<v Speaker 1>phonological rules of the austronesian </v>
<v Speaker 1>languages of melanesia.</v>

61
00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:31.353
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>brother is pronounced enough in before </v>

62
00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:42.460
<v Speaker 1>shark suck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stand or stand up,</v>

63
00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:47.730
<v Speaker 1>sun up words of english origin are also </v>
<v Speaker 1>generally used differently than they are</v>

64
00:03:48.851 --> 00:03:50.680
<v Speaker 1>in english.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

65
00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:51.633
<v Speaker 1>class from the english word place in tok</v>
<v Speaker 1>pc in this means village or hometown </v>

66
00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:01.440
<v Speaker 1>area or region from the english word,</v>
<v Speaker 1>devil means soul shadow,</v>

67
00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:05.740
<v Speaker 1>reflection or image plus two from </v>
<v Speaker 1>english,</v>

68
00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:10.770
<v Speaker 1>close to means close to but also nearly </v>
<v Speaker 1>or almost place months from english.</v>

69
00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:15.400
<v Speaker 1>Christmas means birthday and not just to</v>
<v Speaker 1>christ's birthday.</v>

70
00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:19.780
<v Speaker 1>Anyone's birthday.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Since the vocabulary of talked pcn stems</v>

71
00:04:19.781 --> 00:04:24.190
<v Speaker 1>from a small english vocabulary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oftentimes one word is used to represent</v>

72
00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:27.820
<v Speaker 1>a wide range of synonyms in english or a</v>
<v Speaker 1>category of words,</v>

73
00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:29.013
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gut from english got or have got this </v>

74
00:04:32.561 --> 00:04:35.460
<v Speaker 1>means to have or to possess.</v>
<v Speaker 1>in top pc,</v>

75
00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:39.610
<v Speaker 1>there's just this one word from english </v>
<v Speaker 1>clothes.</v>

76
00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:44.110
<v Speaker 1>This means clothes but also blouse or </v>
<v Speaker 1>dress us.</v>

77
00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:48.190
<v Speaker 1>This means angry or annoyed or cross in </v>
<v Speaker 1>english.</v>

78
00:04:48.191 --> 00:04:52.720
<v Speaker 1>Cross means mildly annoyed and many </v>
<v Speaker 1>north americans might be unfamiliar with</v>

79
00:04:52.721 --> 00:04:54.480
<v Speaker 1>that word,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in top pc,</v>

80
00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:57.730
<v Speaker 1>it's the common word for all dEgrees of </v>
<v Speaker 1>anger or annoyance.</v>

81
00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:01.240
<v Speaker 1>Two months from english,</v>

<v Speaker 1>or too much,</v>

83
00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:07.383
<v Speaker 1>and some words have expanded beyond </v>
<v Speaker 1>synonyms to cover a wider range of </v>

84
00:05:10.361 --> 00:05:13.420
<v Speaker 1>meanings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stump from english stop.</v>

85
00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:16.750
<v Speaker 1>This means to be located somewhere,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to remain,</v>

86
00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:17.673
<v Speaker 1>to stay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to rest or to be in progress with this </v>

87
00:05:21.401 --> 00:05:21.640
<v Speaker 1>word.</v>

88
00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:23.800
<v Speaker 1>It might be a bit harder to wrap your </v>
<v Speaker 1>head around.</v>

89
00:05:23.801 --> 00:05:27.160
<v Speaker 1>It's different meanings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you stop somewhere than you are there</v>

90
00:05:27.161 --> 00:05:29.110

91
00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:31.450
<v Speaker 1>You are staying there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You are situated there.</v>

92
00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:32.493
<v Speaker 1>The meaning of to be in progress stems </v>
<v Speaker 1>from the meaning of remaining because </v>

93
00:05:35.831 --> 00:05:38.770
<v Speaker 1>the action is remaining in progress.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

94

<v Speaker 1>penn belong me.</v>

00:07:01.790 --> 00:07:04.610
<v Speaker 1>and there are also words for many </v>
<v Speaker 1>austronesian languages.</v>

119
00:07:05.730 --> 00:07:08.850
<v Speaker 1>Grammar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While The vocabulary of top pc in mainly</v>

120
00:07:08.851 --> 00:07:09.684
<v Speaker 1>comes from english,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the grammar largely reflects the </v>

121
00:07:11.551 --> 00:07:15.630
<v Speaker 1>austronesian languages spoken by early </v>
<v Speaker 1>pigeon speakers on the plantations.</v>

122
00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:16.673
<v Speaker 1>Let's look at a few examples here and </v>
<v Speaker 1>later we'll see more grammatical </v>

123
00:07:18.961 --> 00:07:21.810
<v Speaker 1>features in context.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The predicate marker.</v>

124
00:07:21.870 --> 00:07:24.870
<v Speaker 1>All third person sentences contained a </v>
<v Speaker 1>predicate marker.</v>

125
00:07:25.110 --> 00:07:25.943
<v Speaker 1>He</v>

126
00:07:26.310 --> 00:07:27.143
<v Speaker 2>plus</v>

127
00:07:28.310 --> 00:07:30.830
<v Speaker 1>the village doesn't have any water word </v>
<v Speaker 1>for word.</v>

128
00:07:30.831 --> 00:07:33.440
<v Speaker 1>This sentence is village predicate </v>
<v Speaker 1>marker.</v>

129
00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:34.333
<v Speaker 1>No have water.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The word he tells us that what comes </v>

130
00:07:37.041 --> 00:07:37.874
<v Speaker 1>next is the predicate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the part of the sentence telling us </v>

131
00:07:40.011 --> 00:07:40.844
<v Speaker 1>something about the subject and normally</v>
<v Speaker 1>contains a verb in the language with a </v>

132
00:07:43.971 --> 00:07:44.804
<v Speaker 1>simple vocabulary and grammar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would be easy to hear the predicate </v>

133
00:07:47.511 --> 00:07:51.530
<v Speaker 1>as part of the subject if there were no </v>
<v Speaker 1>predicate marker place.</v>

134
00:07:51.550 --> 00:07:56.010
<v Speaker 1>Noga water could be understood as the </v>
<v Speaker 1>village that doesn't have any water,</v>

135
00:07:56.250 --> 00:07:57.083
<v Speaker 1>which would leave the listener waiting </v>
<v Speaker 1>for a predicate to follow because that </v>

136
00:07:59.791 --> 00:08:03.150
<v Speaker 1>whole phrase sounds like the subject.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Next,</v>

137
00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:07.200
<v Speaker 1>the transitive verb marker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Iem when verbs are transitive,</v>

138
00:08:07.290 --> 00:08:09.720
<v Speaker 1>in other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they are followed by an object,</v>

139
00:08:09.780 --> 00:08:11.550
<v Speaker 1>the suffix him is attached</v>

140
00:08:11.860 --> 00:08:13.630
<v Speaker 2>me like in two months.</v>

141
00:08:14.790 --> 00:08:18.840
<v Speaker 1>This means I really liked beer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like really beer.</v>

142
00:08:19.270 --> 00:08:23.570
<v Speaker 1>Liking consists of like from english,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like with the transitive suffix,</v>

<v Speaker 1>look from english,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look with the transitive suffix.</v>

146
00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:38.353
<v Speaker 1>Him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The sentence also contains an </v>

147
00:08:39.951 --> 00:08:43.460
<v Speaker 1>interesting word long,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which brings me to the next point.</v>

148
00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:44.473
<v Speaker 1>Prepositions talk.</v>

<v Speaker 1>It's used to cover a wide range of </v>

151
00:08:52.611 --> 00:08:57.611
<v Speaker 1>english prepositions in by on with from </v>
<v Speaker 1>to and have a look at this Example</v>

<v Speaker 2>all long monday,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lonely.</v>

153
00:09:03.230 --> 00:09:04.063
<v Speaker 1>This means they went by road on monday </v>
<v Speaker 1>to lay they preposition marker go by </v>

154
00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:13.250

<v Speaker 1>That's the name of a city.</v>

155
00:09:13.550 --> 00:09:14.383
<v Speaker 1>The word old comes from english all but </v>
<v Speaker 1>one of its uses is the third person </v>

156
00:09:17.991 --> 00:09:21.910
<v Speaker 1>plural pronoun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The other main preposition is belong,</v>

157
00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:23.800
<v Speaker 1>which comes from english,</v>
<v Speaker 1>belong.</v>

158
00:09:24.070 --> 00:09:28.840
<v Speaker 1>It covers the meanings of and for and is</v>
<v Speaker 1>often used to indicate possession.</v>

159
00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:30.033
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

160
00:09:30.130 --> 00:09:32.190
<v Speaker 2>this fella emmy,</v>

161

162
00:09:39.170 --> 00:09:41.430
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Next,</v>

163
00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:42.353
<v Speaker 1>the adjective marker paler.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The suffix pillar is normally added to </v>

164
00:09:45.361 --> 00:09:48.270
<v Speaker 1>single syllable adjectives when they </v>
<v Speaker 1>appear before nouns,</v>

165
00:09:48.390 --> 00:09:53.170
<v Speaker 1>so a big tree is the law comes from </v>
<v Speaker 1>english big,</v>

166
00:09:53.380 --> 00:09:55.630

<v Speaker 1>attached to it.</v>

167
00:09:55.870 --> 00:09:58.780
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] is a word from one of </v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] austronesian,</v>

168
00:09:58.790 --> 00:09:59.623
<v Speaker 1>substratum languages.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's also worth pointing out that this </v>

169
00:10:01.841 --> 00:10:02.674
<v Speaker 1>phrase has no indefinite article talk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pc has no definite article and know </v>

170
00:10:06.011 --> 00:10:07.750
<v Speaker 1>indefinite article.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>

171
00:10:07.810 --> 00:10:11.080
<v Speaker 1>no equivalent of the or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but for Clarity,</v>

172
00:10:11.140 --> 00:10:14.830
<v Speaker 1>one pillar meaning one can be used.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this phrase could be</v>

173
00:10:14.920 --> 00:10:15.753
<v Speaker 2>one pillar,</v>

174

176
00:10:23.021 --> 00:10:25.020
<v Speaker 1>to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

<v Speaker 1>minute.</v>

207
00:12:18.340 --> 00:12:22.840
<v Speaker 1>Talk piecing verbs are basically not </v>
<v Speaker 1>conjugated and the verb form is the same</v>

<v Speaker 1>for all persons and numbers and times to</v>

210
00:12:30.910 --> 00:12:31.743
<v Speaker 1>etc.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or you can use an auxiliary verb that </v>

211
00:12:33.491 --> 00:12:36.550
<v Speaker 1>shows aspect like being which shows </v>
<v Speaker 1>completion.</v>

212
00:12:36.920 --> 00:12:39.650
<v Speaker 1>Another option is to place penis from </v>
<v Speaker 1>english,</v>

213
00:12:39.680 --> 00:12:40.513
<v Speaker 1>finish after the verb for the future you</v>

00:12:47.860 --> 00:12:51.220
<v Speaker 1>you can use the word bi or buying by.</v>

217
00:12:55.961 --> 00:12:56.794
<v Speaker 1>from the old fashioned english </v>
<v Speaker 1>expression by and by meaning after a </v>

218
00:12:59.981 --> 00:13:00.814
<v Speaker 1>short time.</v>

219
00:13:03.250 --> 00:13:05.830
<v Speaker 1>relation to time or not normally </v>
<v Speaker 1>necessary.</v>

220
00:13:05.890 --> 00:13:09.460
<v Speaker 1>If the time is clear from the context </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the adverbs of the sentence,</v>

221
00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:14.320
<v Speaker 1>hopefully this video and the language </v>

222
00:13:14.321 --> 00:13:15.970
<v Speaker 1>of what the seen is like.</v>

223
00:13:16.180 --> 00:13:19.270
<v Speaker 1>The english roots of much of its </v>
<v Speaker 1>vocabulary are obvious,</v>

224
00:13:19.300 --> 00:13:22.420
<v Speaker 1>but it's also obvious that talk present </v>
<v Speaker 1>is not english.</v>

225
00:13:22.590 --> 00:13:23.423
<v Speaker 1>It's grammar is very different and even </v>
<v Speaker 1>the vocabulary is generally used quite </v>

226
00:13:26.861 --> 00:13:27.694
<v Speaker 1>differently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Talk be seen as a language in its own </v>

227
00:13:29.621 --> 00:13:30.454
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's used in the parliament of papa new </v>

00:13:34.721 --> 00:13:38.350
<v Speaker 1>it's used by people all over the country</v>
<v Speaker 1>every day as a lingua franca.</v>

230
00:13:38.620 --> 00:13:39.453
<v Speaker 1>there are books written and talk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's still not widely used as a </v>

231
00:13:42.371 --> 00:13:43.204
<v Speaker 1>literary language,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there are people who think it can </v>

232
00:13:45.071 --> 00:13:47.050
<v Speaker 1>and should fulfill that function as </v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

233
00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:51.160
<v Speaker 1>but with english also being an official </v>
