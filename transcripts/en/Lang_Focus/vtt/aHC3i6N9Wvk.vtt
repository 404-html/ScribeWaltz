00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.540
<v Speaker 1>Quiz time or the following words?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chinese or Japanese first?</v>

2
00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:07.020
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's Japanese next.</v>

3
00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:10.200
<v Speaker 1>It's Chinese.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Next.</v>

4
00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:14.430
<v Speaker 1>Actually this is both Chinese and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Japanese and finally,</v>

5
00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:17.580
<v Speaker 1>actually this is neither.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is ty.</v>

6
00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.370
<v Speaker 1>What you thought.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All Asian languages are the same.</v>

7
00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:26.473
<v Speaker 1>Hello everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Welcome to the Lange Focus Channel and </v>

8
00:00:27.981 --> 00:00:28.814
<v Speaker 1>my name is Paul.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Today's topic is the question how </v>

9
00:00:30.951 --> 00:00:31.784
<v Speaker 1>similar our Chinese and Japanese,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people look at a map of Asia </v>

10
00:00:35.331 --> 00:00:36.164
<v Speaker 1>and see how close to Japan and China are</v>
<v Speaker 1>or they might look at a sample of </v>

11
00:00:38.961 --> 00:00:39.794
<v Speaker 1>Chinese and Japanese writing and think </v>
<v Speaker 1>that something looks similar and they </v>

12
00:00:42.051 --> 00:00:44.570
<v Speaker 1>might conclude that the two languages </v>
<v Speaker 1>are similar,</v>

13
00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:46.550
<v Speaker 1>but are they really similar?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

14
00:00:46.551 --> 00:00:49.520
<v Speaker 1>the short answer is no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They are completely different languages,</v>

15
00:00:49.521 --> 00:00:50.354
<v Speaker 1>but Japanese has been highly influenced </v>
<v Speaker 1>by Chinese and it's vocabulary and then </v>

16
00:00:53.661 --> 00:00:54.494
<v Speaker 1>it's writing systems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chinese and Japanese do not share any </v>

17
00:00:56.631 --> 00:00:59.150
<v Speaker 1>common origin and they don't belong to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the same language.</v>

18
00:00:59.151 --> 00:00:59.984
<v Speaker 1>Family,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Chinese languages belonged to the </v>

19
00:01:01.341 --> 00:01:02.630
<v Speaker 1>CNO,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to Betson language.</v>

20
00:01:02.631 --> 00:01:06.440
<v Speaker 1>Family in Japanese as far as we know </v>
<v Speaker 1>belongs to the Japonica language.</v>

21
00:01:06.441 --> 00:01:08.360
<v Speaker 1>Family phonology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First off,</v>

22
00:01:08.361 --> 00:01:09.194
<v Speaker 1>the phonology of the language is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is very different with the most basic </v>

23
00:01:11.361 --> 00:01:13.640
<v Speaker 1>difference being that Chinese is a tonal</v>
<v Speaker 1>language.</v>

24
00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:14.473
<v Speaker 1>While Japanese is not a tonal language </v>
<v Speaker 1>is one in which there are tones or </v>

25
00:01:17.391 --> 00:01:18.224
<v Speaker 1>pitches that helped determine the </v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning of the words you use if you use </v>

26
00:01:20.871 --> 00:01:23.360
<v Speaker 1>the wrong tone than the meaning of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>word changes.</v>

27
00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:26.740
<v Speaker 1>Here's an example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the word for teacher sure.</v>

28
00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:30.170
<v Speaker 1>And the word for naive slow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

29
00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:31.423
<v Speaker 1>And the word for old fashion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm sure that Chinese teachers get </v>

30
00:01:35.271 --> 00:01:39.680
<v Speaker 1>called naive and old fashion all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>time by mistake or maybe not by mistake.</v>

31
00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:40.753
<v Speaker 1>In Japanese,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are basically no tones like this </v>

32
00:01:42.171 --> 00:01:44.660
<v Speaker 1>that determine the meaning of words.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In Japanese,</v>

33
00:01:44.661 --> 00:01:47.960
<v Speaker 1>there is something called pitch accent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which means that the syllables of a word</v>

34
00:01:47.961 --> 00:01:50.120
<v Speaker 1>have either a higher pitch or a lower </v>
<v Speaker 1>pitch,</v>

35
00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:51.163
<v Speaker 1>but they're not like the tones and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Chinese because they typically don't </v>

36
00:01:53.091 --> 00:01:55.820
<v Speaker 1>determine the meaning of the word.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're more like stress.</v>

37
00:01:55.821 --> 00:01:56.654
<v Speaker 1>In English structure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the structure and grammar of the two </v>

38
00:01:59.691 --> 00:02:01.160
<v Speaker 1>languages is completely different.</v>

39
00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:04.520
<v Speaker 1>At the most basic level,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chinese is an Svo language,</v>

40
00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:08.660
<v Speaker 1>while Japanese is an Sov language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's an example in Chinese.</v>

41
00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:12.830
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This means he speaks Chinese and you can</v>

42
00:02:12.831 --> 00:02:13.664
<v Speaker 1>see s the o subject verb object and </v>
<v Speaker 1>here's that sentence translated into </v>

43
00:02:18.681 --> 00:02:19.514
<v Speaker 1>Japanese,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how they walk to go google on Nasim us </v>

44
00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:24.500
<v Speaker 1>here we can see s o v subject,</v>
<v Speaker 1>object,</v>

45
00:02:24.501 --> 00:02:25.334
<v Speaker 1>verb and you can see there are some </v>
<v Speaker 1>extra little words in Japanese that </v>

46
00:02:27.681 --> 00:02:29.960
<v Speaker 1>don't exist in the Chinese sentence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

47
00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.823
<v Speaker 1>Japanese has the topic marker Wa which </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't exist in Chinese and Japanese </v>

48
00:02:34.161 --> 00:02:37.670
<v Speaker 1>also has the object marker all which </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't exist in Chinese.</v>

49
00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:39.733
<v Speaker 1>Chinese is an analytic language,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which basically means that you create a </v>

50
00:02:42.261 --> 00:02:45.770
<v Speaker 1>sentence by a placing independent </v>
<v Speaker 1>elements side by side.</v>

51
00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:48.830
<v Speaker 1>Analytic languages like Chinese do not </v>
<v Speaker 1>use inflection.</v>

52
00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:49.723
<v Speaker 1>Inflection means modifying words to </v>
<v Speaker 1>indicate some kind of grammatical </v>

53
00:02:52.281 --> 00:02:53.900
<v Speaker 1>meaning like plural,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gender,</v>

54
00:02:53.901 --> 00:02:55.040
<v Speaker 1>tenths or case.</v>

55
00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:58.460
<v Speaker 1>You don't change any part of a word in </v>
<v Speaker 1>order to change its meaning.</v>

56
00:02:58.461 --> 00:02:59.294
<v Speaker 1>Instead,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can add to the meaning of that word </v>

57
00:03:00.341 --> 00:03:03.160
<v Speaker 1>by adding an extra word next to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Japanese,</v>

58
00:03:03.161 --> 00:03:03.994
<v Speaker 1>on the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's an a glutinous of language that </v>

59
00:03:05.171 --> 00:03:06.004
<v Speaker 1>uses inflection.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A gluten native language is used a lot </v>

60
00:03:07.841 --> 00:03:08.674
<v Speaker 1>of affixes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rather than just placing independent </v>

61
00:03:10.331 --> 00:03:13.510
<v Speaker 1>worlds side by side,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you attach additional pieces to words to</v>

62
00:03:13.511 --> 00:03:14.344
<v Speaker 1>add or modify.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Meaning this kind of inflection in </v>

63
00:03:16.361 --> 00:03:20.260
<v Speaker 1>Japanese means that Japanese words are </v>
<v Speaker 1>often longer than Chinese words and that</v>

64
00:03:20.261 --> 00:03:23.620
<v Speaker 1>it may take a few words in Chinese to </v>
<v Speaker 1>translate one Japanese word.</v>

65
00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:27.640
<v Speaker 1>In these Chinese sentences,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can see that there's no inflection or</v>

66
00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:30.573
<v Speaker 1>this sentence means I go to school or </v>
<v Speaker 1>choose this sentence means I went to </v>

67
00:03:35.831 --> 00:03:36.664
<v Speaker 1>school,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so no part of the verb is changed to </v>

68
00:03:38.141 --> 00:03:38.974
<v Speaker 1>indicate the past tense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can show the past tense by just </v>

69
00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:42.040
<v Speaker 1>adding a time expression.</v>

70
00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:44.800
<v Speaker 1>Now these similar sentences in Japanese </v>
<v Speaker 1>show inflection.</v>

71
00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:49.300
<v Speaker 1>The sentence means I go to school </v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] I went to school.</v>

72
00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:50.263
<v Speaker 1>Once I see what [inaudible] does and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>polite form of I go to school </v>

73
00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:57.310
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] I want to go to school.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does she wear?</v>

74
00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:58.570
<v Speaker 1>De Gaulle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>achy tie.</v>

75
00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:00.910
<v Speaker 1>In this Japanese example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we use inflection,</v>

76
00:04:00.911 --> 00:04:01.744
<v Speaker 1>changing the word to the Eqi form,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then we use a gluten nation to </v>

77
00:04:04.871 --> 00:04:05.704
<v Speaker 1>attach a form that shows intention tied </v>
<v Speaker 1>in Chinese though there's no inflection </v>

78
00:04:09.701 --> 00:04:12.310
<v Speaker 1>or agglutination,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just add an extra word like this.</v>

79
00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:16.690
<v Speaker 1>That's just a brief sample of how </v>
<v Speaker 1>different the grammar is in Japanese and</v>

80
00:04:16.691 --> 00:04:17.524
<v Speaker 1>Chinese.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Basically they're completely different </v>

81
00:04:18.521 --> 00:04:20.770
<v Speaker 1>languages when it comes to their </v>
<v Speaker 1>grammatical structure,</v>

82
00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:21.723
<v Speaker 1>vocabulary and Chinese characters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The one area in which there is some </v>

83
00:04:24.251 --> 00:04:25.084
<v Speaker 1>similarity between Chinese and Japanese </v>
<v Speaker 1>is in vocabulary and in the use of </v>

84
00:04:28.031 --> 00:04:28.864
<v Speaker 1>Chinese characters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>During a period of great Chinese </v>

85
00:04:30.551 --> 00:04:33.160
<v Speaker 1>influence between the fifth and ninth </v>
<v Speaker 1>century Ce,</v>

86
00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:36.970
<v Speaker 1>there was a huge amount of borrowing </v>
<v Speaker 1>from early middle Chinese into Japanese.</v>

87
00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:37.833
<v Speaker 1>Japanese originally had no written form,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so Chinese began to be used as the </v>

88
00:04:40.661 --> 00:04:43.810
<v Speaker 1>literary language and as the language of</v>
<v Speaker 1>science and religion,</v>

89
00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:44.763
<v Speaker 1>Chinese vocabulary began to be borrowed </v>
<v Speaker 1>into Japanese and the Chinese writing </v>

90
00:04:47.771 --> 00:04:50.830
<v Speaker 1>system was gradually adapted to fit the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Japanese language.</v>

91
00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:51.783
<v Speaker 1>So not only were at vocabulary board,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the Chinese characters that </v>

92
00:04:54.131 --> 00:04:54.964
<v Speaker 1>represent them were also adopted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>60% of the vocabulary words used in </v>

93
00:04:58.301 --> 00:04:59.134
<v Speaker 1>Japanese are of Chinese origin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that includes all of the words in </v>

94
00:05:01.811 --> 00:05:02.644
<v Speaker 1>the dictionary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that includes a lot of very </v>

95
00:05:03.551 --> 00:05:07.420
<v Speaker 1>specialized academic and formal </v>
<v Speaker 1>vocabulary that's mainly used in writing</v>

96
00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:10.330
<v Speaker 1>and spoken Japanese.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The number of Chinese loan words used as</v>

97
00:05:10.331 --> 00:05:14.740
<v Speaker 1>much lower at about 18% the borrowed </v>
<v Speaker 1>words were almost all Chinese nouns,</v>

98
00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:17.980
<v Speaker 1>even though in Japanese they might be </v>
<v Speaker 1>used as verbs or as adjectives.</v>

99
00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:20.980
<v Speaker 1>That's just one way in which the </v>
<v Speaker 1>vocabulary is used differently.</v>

100
00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:21.933
<v Speaker 1>But also with the pronunciation of those</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chinese words that were borrowed into </v>

101
00:05:24.341 --> 00:05:27.430
<v Speaker 1>Japanese changed to match the Japanese </v>
<v Speaker 1>phonological system.</v>

102
00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:30.010
<v Speaker 1>And that included the loss of the tones </v>
<v Speaker 1>of those words.</v>

103
00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:32.530
<v Speaker 1>And also these words were borrowed a </v>
<v Speaker 1>long time ago,</v>

104
00:05:32.531 --> 00:05:35.830
<v Speaker 1>which means that the words have also </v>
<v Speaker 1>changed in pronunciation in Chinese.</v>

105
00:05:35.831 --> 00:05:38.200
<v Speaker 1>So the pronunciation has diverged quite </v>
<v Speaker 1>a bit,</v>

106
00:05:38.201 --> 00:05:39.034
<v Speaker 1>meaning that modern Japanese </v>
<v Speaker 1>pronunciation and modern Chinese </v>

107
00:05:41.291 --> 00:05:44.590
<v Speaker 1>pronunciation of similar characters or </v>
<v Speaker 1>words is quite different.</v>

108
00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:45.633
<v Speaker 1>And it's also important to point out </v>
<v Speaker 1>that mandarin was not the standard form </v>

109
00:05:48.101 --> 00:05:48.934
<v Speaker 1>of Chinese back in those days when those</v>
<v Speaker 1>vocabulary words were borrowed into </v>

110
00:05:51.791 --> 00:05:54.070
<v Speaker 1>Japanese.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So even at the time they were borrowed,</v>

111
00:05:54.071 --> 00:05:56.800
<v Speaker 1>the pronunciation was different from </v>
<v Speaker 1>standard Chinese today.</v>

112
00:05:56.830 --> 00:05:57.663
<v Speaker 1>And what I understand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the modern Japanese pronunciation of </v>

113
00:05:59.451 --> 00:06:00.284
<v Speaker 1>those lone words is often more similar </v>
<v Speaker 1>to modern cantonese than it is to </v>

114
00:06:02.901 --> 00:06:03.734
<v Speaker 1>Mandarin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These examples show how the same words </v>

115
00:06:05.721 --> 00:06:08.510
<v Speaker 1>are pronounced very differently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In Japanese ended Mandarin,</v>

116
00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:09.643
<v Speaker 1>the word for family in Japanese,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's cut date and actually in Japanese </v>

117
00:06:12.681 --> 00:06:16.880
<v Speaker 1>the meaning is more like household or </v>
<v Speaker 1>home and in Mandarin Jab him.</v>

118
00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:19.520
<v Speaker 1>Next,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the word for death in Japanese,</v>

119
00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:20.383
<v Speaker 1>she bolt and amendment to the wall next </v>
<v Speaker 1>to word four season in Japanese key set </v>

120
00:06:25.191 --> 00:06:30.191
<v Speaker 1>to and in Mandarin Gpa and the word for </v>
<v Speaker 1>home country in Japanese vocal group and</v>

121
00:06:31.251 --> 00:06:32.084
<v Speaker 1>in Mandarin or so you can see that these</v>
<v Speaker 1>words look the same and they have </v>

122
00:06:35.811 --> 00:06:38.210
<v Speaker 1>basically the same meaning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they sound very different.</v>

123
00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:39.193
<v Speaker 1>So Chinese vocabulary represented by </v>
<v Speaker 1>Chinese characters were borrowed into </v>

124
00:06:42.411 --> 00:06:43.244
<v Speaker 1>Japanese,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but those Chinese characters were also </v>

125
00:06:44.991 --> 00:06:45.824
<v Speaker 1>them applied to native Japanese </v>
<v Speaker 1>vocabulary that had a related meaning </v>

126
00:06:48.630 --> 00:06:49.463
<v Speaker 1>for those Chinese loan words.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That means that a Chinese speaker can </v>

127
00:06:51.471 --> 00:06:52.304
<v Speaker 1>often look at a native Japanese word and</v>
<v Speaker 1>understand its core meaning without </v>

128
00:06:55.101 --> 00:06:58.100
<v Speaker 1>knowing that Japanese words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because the Chinese character is used to</v>

129
00:06:58.101 --> 00:06:58.934
<v Speaker 1>represent it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Chinese people can often read a text </v>

130
00:07:00.921 --> 00:07:01.754
<v Speaker 1>in Japanese and they can make sense of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the basic meaning of it based on the </v>

131
00:07:04.281 --> 00:07:05.114
<v Speaker 1>Chinese characters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they won't understand all the </v>

132
00:07:06.711 --> 00:07:07.400
<v Speaker 1>details.</v>

133
00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:08.233
<v Speaker 1>And the same is true in reverse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Japanese people can look at a Chinese </v>

134
00:07:10.311 --> 00:07:11.144
<v Speaker 1>texts and kind of make sense of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning of it based on the Chinese </v>

135
00:07:13.461 --> 00:07:14.294
<v Speaker 1>characters that they know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it is easy to misunderstand the </v>

136
00:07:16.341 --> 00:07:17.174
<v Speaker 1>details of what's written,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if they have zero knowledge </v>

137
00:07:19.101 --> 00:07:22.340
<v Speaker 1>of the other language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here are some Japanese example sentences</v>

138
00:07:22.341 --> 00:07:23.174
<v Speaker 1>that have the same Chinese characters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the meaning is very different </v>

139
00:07:25.221 --> 00:07:28.260
<v Speaker 1>because of the inflection that's used.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nicole [inaudible],</v>

140
00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:31.760
<v Speaker 1>that means the cat eats fish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nicola suck and [inaudible].</v>

141
00:07:32.090 --> 00:07:35.030
<v Speaker 1>That means the cat doesn't eat fish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nicola suck.</v>

142
00:07:35.050 --> 00:07:35.883
<v Speaker 1>Another topic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That means the cat ate fish in the past </v>

143
00:07:38.690 --> 00:07:40.550
<v Speaker 1>tense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nicola [inaudible] Samadhi,</v>

144
00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:44.270
<v Speaker 1>the cap plans to eat fish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nicola [inaudible] data.</v>

145
00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:45.313
<v Speaker 1>That means the cat was eaten by a fish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So a Chinese speaker of reading these </v>

146
00:07:48.071 --> 00:07:51.230
<v Speaker 1>sentences would get the core meaning of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Chinese characters,</v>

147
00:07:51.231 --> 00:07:53.480
<v Speaker 1>but they would miss some meaning in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>inflection.</v>

148
00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:54.313
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the negative or the past tense or </v>

149
00:07:55.821 --> 00:07:58.220
<v Speaker 1>intention or the passive form.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Especially.</v>

150
00:07:58.221 --> 00:08:00.590
<v Speaker 1>The last example could be highly </v>
<v Speaker 1>misunderstood,</v>

151
00:08:00.710 --> 00:08:01.543
<v Speaker 1>so imagine you're an English speaker </v>
<v Speaker 1>reading something with English long </v>

152
00:08:03.531 --> 00:08:05.030
<v Speaker 1>words.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It might look something like this,</v>

153
00:08:05.060 --> 00:08:06.320
<v Speaker 1>Catholic glofish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>

154
00:08:06.500 --> 00:08:07.250
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>blah.</v>

155
00:08:07.250 --> 00:08:09.260
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even after just a little bit of study in</v>

156
00:08:09.261 --> 00:08:10.094
<v Speaker 1>Japanese or Chinese speaker could </v>
<v Speaker 1>probably learn enough to understand </v>

157
00:08:12.591 --> 00:08:14.780
<v Speaker 1>basic Japanese sentences like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For me,</v>

158
00:08:14.781 --> 00:08:17.600
<v Speaker 1>as someone who's studied Japanese two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a relatively advanced level,</v>

159
00:08:17.601 --> 00:08:18.434
<v Speaker 1>the same as true in reverse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I was in Taiwan last year on the </v>

160
00:08:21.021 --> 00:08:23.930
<v Speaker 1>subway for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could read a lot of the advertisements</v>

161
00:08:24.110 --> 00:08:27.710
<v Speaker 1>and I would get most of the meaning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't understand all of the Chinese</v>

162
00:08:27.711 --> 00:08:28.544
<v Speaker 1>characters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I would get usually three out of </v>

163
00:08:29.871 --> 00:08:33.740
<v Speaker 1>four of them and the fourth one would be</v>
<v Speaker 1>new to me because in Chinese there are a</v>

164
00:08:33.741 --> 00:08:36.710
<v Speaker 1>lot of characters that actually aren't </v>
<v Speaker 1>used in Japanese at all,</v>

165
00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:37.633
<v Speaker 1>but just getting three out of four of </v>
<v Speaker 1>them was often enough to understand the </v>

166
00:08:39.741 --> 00:08:41.270
<v Speaker 1>basic meaning of that advertisement.</v>

167
00:08:41.330 --> 00:08:42.163
<v Speaker 1>But of course I had no idea how to </v>
<v Speaker 1>pronounce those Chinese characters and </v>

168
00:08:44.451 --> 00:08:46.730
<v Speaker 1>if I tried to read them out loud like </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Japanese,</v>

169
00:08:46.731 --> 00:08:50.570
<v Speaker 1>I would hear laughter from both my </v>
<v Speaker 1>girlfriend and from local bystanders.</v>

170
00:08:50.690 --> 00:08:51.523
<v Speaker 1>It might seem strange that I can look at</v>
<v Speaker 1>a Chinese character in Chinese and </v>

171
00:08:53.841 --> 00:08:56.190
<v Speaker 1>understand what it means without knowing</v>
<v Speaker 1>how to say it,</v>

172
00:08:56.310 --> 00:08:58.320
<v Speaker 1>but think of it as a symbol,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a number.</v>

173
00:08:58.380 --> 00:08:59.213
<v Speaker 1>The number seven right here is </v>
<v Speaker 1>pronounced differently in different </v>

174
00:09:01.111 --> 00:09:02.520
<v Speaker 1>languages,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when you see it,</v>

175
00:09:02.521 --> 00:09:04.650
<v Speaker 1>you know what it means,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no matter how you pronounce it.</v>

176
00:09:04.830 --> 00:09:05.663
<v Speaker 1>Chinese characters are kind of like that</v>
<v Speaker 1>except that they represent a much wider </v>

177
00:09:08.551 --> 00:09:09.384
<v Speaker 1>range of meanings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Chinese characters used in any </v>

178
00:09:11.041 --> 00:09:11.874
<v Speaker 1>particular sentence can be very </v>
<v Speaker 1>different from those used in the other </v>

179
00:09:14.131 --> 00:09:14.964
<v Speaker 1>language for a sentence of similar </v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning and in Japanese there are a lot </v>

180
00:09:17.551 --> 00:09:20.340
<v Speaker 1>of compound words that were created from</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chinese characters,</v>

181
00:09:20.341 --> 00:09:23.460
<v Speaker 1>but those compound words don't actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>exist in Chinese.</v>

182
00:09:23.490 --> 00:09:24.323
<v Speaker 1>These are called Wasa Congo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which means something like Chinese </v>

183
00:09:26.431 --> 00:09:27.264
<v Speaker 1>vocabulary created in Japan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here are some examples of Wasa icon </v>

184
00:09:30.231 --> 00:09:31.064
<v Speaker 1>will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some were created to represent things </v>

185
00:09:32.401 --> 00:09:33.234
<v Speaker 1>unique to Japan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Ninja Geisha and others were </v>

186
00:09:36.211 --> 00:09:37.044
<v Speaker 1>created during the Meiji period to </v>
<v Speaker 1>represent western concepts like </v>

187
00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:41.500
<v Speaker 1>democracy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>men shoes.</v>

188
00:09:42.450 --> 00:09:43.283
<v Speaker 1>So even though you might recognize a lot</v>
<v Speaker 1>of characters when you look at some </v>

189
00:09:45.541 --> 00:09:46.374
<v Speaker 1>texts in the other language,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they might be used in a very different </v>

190
00:09:48.241 --> 00:09:49.800
<v Speaker 1>ways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the meaning will be unclear.</v>

191
00:09:49.980 --> 00:09:50.813
<v Speaker 1>A Chinese speaker might be confused by </v>
<v Speaker 1>Wasi Kango when they tried to read some </v>

192
00:09:53.611 --> 00:09:54.444
<v Speaker 1>Japanese and Japanese people might be </v>
<v Speaker 1>confused when they read Chinese because </v>

193
00:09:57.631 --> 00:09:58.464
<v Speaker 1>there are a lot of Chinese characters </v>
<v Speaker 1>that were never boiled into Japanese in </v>

194
00:10:00.991 --> 00:10:03.660
<v Speaker 1>the first place or they're not used in </v>
<v Speaker 1>modern Japanese.</v>

195
00:10:03.810 --> 00:10:04.643
<v Speaker 1>But in either case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even basic knowledge of the other </v>

196
00:10:06.451 --> 00:10:08.910
<v Speaker 1>language would help in reading </v>
<v Speaker 1>comprehension quite a bit.</v>

197
00:10:09.180 --> 00:10:13.320
<v Speaker 1>Japanese returned moen words in Chinese,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so as we've discussed already,</v>

198
00:10:13.350 --> 00:10:16.380
<v Speaker 1>lots of Chinese vocabulary was borrowed </v>
<v Speaker 1>into Japanese,</v>

199
00:10:16.470 --> 00:10:19.890
<v Speaker 1>but some Japanese vocabulary has also </v>
<v Speaker 1>been borrowed into Chinese.</v>

200
00:10:20.100 --> 00:10:23.970
<v Speaker 1>A moment ago I mentioned Wasa Kango,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Japanese vocabulary created from Chinese</v>

201
00:10:23.971 --> 00:10:26.700
<v Speaker 1>roots vocabulary that didn't exist in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Chinese,</v>

202
00:10:26.910 --> 00:10:27.743
<v Speaker 1>but some of those Lasa Kango have </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually been borrowed from Japanese </v>

203
00:10:30.451 --> 00:10:31.284
<v Speaker 1>into Chinese.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some sources say that such vocabulary </v>

204
00:10:33.661 --> 00:10:36.930
<v Speaker 1>accounts for around 30% of modern </v>
<v Speaker 1>Chinese vocabulary.</v>

205
00:10:37.410 --> 00:10:38.243
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way those returned loan words are </v>

206
00:10:39.511 --> 00:10:40.344
<v Speaker 1>pronounced as based on the modern </v>
<v Speaker 1>Chinese pronunciation of the Chinese </v>

207
00:10:42.961 --> 00:10:44.910
<v Speaker 1>characters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here are some examples.</v>

208
00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.090
<v Speaker 1>The word for history in Japanese that </v>
<v Speaker 1>Kishi in Mandarin,</v>

209
00:10:48.300 --> 00:10:49.133
<v Speaker 1>the shoe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the word for industry in Japanese Kogel </v>

210
00:10:52.070 --> 00:10:52.903
<v Speaker 1>in mandarins,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the word for electron or electronic in </v>

211
00:10:57.001 --> 00:10:57.834
<v Speaker 1>Japanese.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then cheat in Mandarin and the word for </v>

212
00:11:01.981 --> 00:11:05.430
<v Speaker 1>injection in Japanese to shop in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Mandarin jewel.</v>

213
00:11:05.431 --> 00:11:08.010
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The word for philosophy in Japanese.</v>

214
00:11:08.011 --> 00:11:09.780
<v Speaker 1>Tetsu got goats in Mandarin.</v>

215
00:11:10.170 --> 00:11:13.200
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the workforce system in Japanese,</v>

216
00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:16.230
<v Speaker 1>Cato and in Mandarin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She told him,</v>

217
00:11:16.950 --> 00:11:20.190
<v Speaker 1>and most Chinese people these days are </v>
<v Speaker 1>probably not even aware that those words</v>

218
00:11:20.191 --> 00:11:23.490
<v Speaker 1>were borrowed from Japanese.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's also important to point out that in</v>

219
00:11:23.491 --> 00:11:24.324
<v Speaker 1>mainland China,</v>
<v Speaker 1>simplified Chinese characters are now </v>

220
00:11:26.281 --> 00:11:27.114
<v Speaker 1>used as opposed to the traditional </v>
<v Speaker 1>Chinese characters used in Taiwan and </v>

221
00:11:29.940 --> 00:11:30.773
<v Speaker 1>Hong Kong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That means that someone from mainland </v>

222
00:11:31.951 --> 00:11:32.784
<v Speaker 1>China may have some more trouble </v>
<v Speaker 1>recognizing Japanese Kanji than someone </v>

223
00:11:35.401 --> 00:11:36.750
<v Speaker 1>from Taiwan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

224
00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:37.673
<v Speaker 1>someone short,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chinese and Japanese are very different </v>

225
00:11:39.451 --> 00:11:41.790
<v Speaker 1>languages,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially the spoken languages.</v>

226
00:11:41.820 --> 00:11:42.653
<v Speaker 1>Even though there was a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>vocabulary borrowed from Chinese in the </v>

227
00:11:44.881 --> 00:11:47.670
<v Speaker 1>Japanese and the little bit from </v>
<v Speaker 1>Japanese into Chinese,</v>

228
00:11:47.970 --> 00:11:48.803
<v Speaker 1>only in writing are those two languages </v>
<v Speaker 1>somewhat intelligible because of the </v>

229
00:11:51.631 --> 00:11:52.464
<v Speaker 1>Chinese characters that are used.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the question of the day for Japanese </v>

230
