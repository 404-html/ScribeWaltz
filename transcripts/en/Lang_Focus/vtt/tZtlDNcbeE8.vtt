00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:01.500
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2
00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:04.980
<v Speaker 1>before we get started with this video,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had one little announcement to make,</v>

3
00:00:04.981 --> 00:00:06.920
<v Speaker 1>but I forgot what it was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um.</v>

4
00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:08.273
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

5
00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:15.780
<v Speaker 1>As you can see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have reached 10,000</v>

6
00:00:15.781 --> 00:00:19.450
<v Speaker 1>subscribers on the length focus channel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank you for helping me reach 10,000.</v>

7
00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:20.543
<v Speaker 1>Let's keep it going.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's hit fifty thousand one hundred </v>

8
00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:23.940
<v Speaker 1>thousand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's see how big this gets,</v>

9
00:00:23.941 --> 00:00:27.750
<v Speaker 1>but you guys are the original crew.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank you for your support from day one.</v>

10
00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:29.033
<v Speaker 1>So let's get into today's topic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to talk about the Persian </v>

11
00:00:31.891 --> 00:00:34.010
<v Speaker 1>language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's sometimes known as Farsi,</v>

12
00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:34.883
<v Speaker 1>but I'm going to call it Persian.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Persian is a language that is widely </v>

13
00:00:37.741 --> 00:00:40.560
<v Speaker 1>spoken in parts of the Middle East and </v>
<v Speaker 1>in Central Asia,</v>

14
00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:41.453
<v Speaker 1>and it has a long history stretching </v>
<v Speaker 1>back thousands of years with a few </v>

15
00:00:44.191 --> 00:00:45.024
<v Speaker 1>different stages along the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Persian language originated in </v>

16
00:00:47.611 --> 00:00:49.740
<v Speaker 1>southwestern Persia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wait,</v>

17
00:00:49.741 --> 00:00:51.690
<v Speaker 1>I don't see Persia on this map right </v>
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>

18
00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:53.310
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's right.</v>

19
00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:55.300
<v Speaker 1>Today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Persia is known as Iran.</v>

20
00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:56.603
<v Speaker 1>Persian is the one official language of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Iran and it is the native language of </v>

21
00:00:59.761 --> 00:01:01.200
<v Speaker 1>about half of Iranians.</v>

22
00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:05.100
<v Speaker 1>The statistics actually range from about</v>
<v Speaker 1>45 to 55 percent,</v>

23
00:01:05.101 --> 00:01:09.210
<v Speaker 1>but I'm going to say half and that makes</v>
<v Speaker 1>it 38 point 5 million people,</v>

24
00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:10.283
<v Speaker 1>but virtually all other Iranians can </v>
<v Speaker 1>speak Persian as a second language as </v>

25
00:01:13.711 --> 00:01:14.544
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Persian is also an official language in </v>

26
00:01:16.391 --> 00:01:19.110
<v Speaker 1>two other countries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you might not know that because they</v>

27
00:01:19.111 --> 00:01:21.900
<v Speaker 1>refer to the language by different names</v>
<v Speaker 1>in those places.</v>

28
00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:22.973
<v Speaker 1>In Afghanistan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the language is referred to as dory for </v>

29
00:01:25.381 --> 00:01:27.840
<v Speaker 1>political reasons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but speakers of Dari,</v>

30
00:01:27.841 --> 00:01:30.450
<v Speaker 1>Persian themselves often called their </v>
<v Speaker 1>language Farsi.</v>

31
00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.020
<v Speaker 1>It's actually really hard to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>reliable statistics about Afghanistan,</v>

32
00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:34.883
<v Speaker 1>but most sources seem to say that it is </v>
<v Speaker 1>spoken by 25 to 30 percent of the </v>

33
00:01:38.821 --> 00:01:39.654
<v Speaker 1>population in Afghanistan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it is also widely used as a Lingua </v>

34
00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:45.510
<v Speaker 1>Franca and pretty much everyone in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>country can speak.</v>

35
00:01:45.511 --> 00:01:46.344
<v Speaker 1>Dari in Tajikistan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Persian is referred to as [inaudible] </v>

36
00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:52.740
<v Speaker 1>because that's what the Soviet Union </v>
<v Speaker 1>conquers decided to call it.</v>

37
00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.830
<v Speaker 1>You know how foreign empires like to </v>
<v Speaker 1>divide and conquer?</v>

38
00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:56.670
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

39
00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.100
<v Speaker 1>Don't be friends with that powerful </v>
<v Speaker 1>country over there.</v>

40
00:01:59.101 --> 00:01:59.340
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

41
00:01:59.340 --> 00:01:59.980
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're.</v>

42
00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:01.680
<v Speaker 1>You're separate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're distinct from them,</v>

43
00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.070
<v Speaker 1>but touching Persian is indeed a variety</v>
<v Speaker 1>of Persian.</v>

44
00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:06.083
<v Speaker 1>It is spoken by 6 million people in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Tajikistan and another one point 5 </v>

45
00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.850
<v Speaker 1>million people in the nearby Central </v>
<v Speaker 1>Asian countries,</v>

46
00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:12.803
<v Speaker 1>especially in Uzbekistan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Person has also spoken by about $5 </v>

47
00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:19.140
<v Speaker 1>million expatriates around the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially in some Middle East countries</v>

48
00:02:19.141 --> 00:02:20.670
<v Speaker 1>like Iraq,</v>
<v Speaker 1>UAE,</v>

49
00:02:20.671 --> 00:02:21.710
<v Speaker 1>Bahrain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

50
00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:23.580
<v Speaker 1>places like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as well as the USA.</v>

51
00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:24.533
<v Speaker 1>So let's recap in your round.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are about 38 point 5 million </v>

52
00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:29.820
<v Speaker 1>native speakers of Persian in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Afghanistan and Pakistan.</v>

53
00:02:29.821 --> 00:02:32.220
<v Speaker 1>There are $11 million native speakers of</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dari,</v>

54
00:02:32.221 --> 00:02:34.710
<v Speaker 1>Persian in Tajikistan and surrounding </v>
<v Speaker 1>areas.</v>

55
00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:38.820
<v Speaker 1>There are seven point 5 million native </v>
<v Speaker 1>speakers of touchy Persian and there are</v>

56
00:02:38.821 --> 00:02:39.654
<v Speaker 1>about $5 million pat speaking Persian </v>
<v Speaker 1>around the world that comes to a total </v>

57
00:02:42.871 --> 00:02:45.390
<v Speaker 1>of $62 million native speakers.</v>

58
00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:46.283
<v Speaker 1>But if we include all the second </v>
<v Speaker 1>language speakers of Persian who use it </v>

59
00:02:48.961 --> 00:02:49.794
<v Speaker 1>as a Lingua Franca,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then the number rises to 110 million </v>

60
00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:55.860
<v Speaker 1>speakers around the world are Persian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dirty and tragic.</v>

61
00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:58.230
<v Speaker 1>All really the same language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

62
00:02:58.231 --> 00:03:00.520
<v Speaker 1>they are varieties of one single </v>
<v Speaker 1>language.</v>

63
00:03:00.521 --> 00:03:01.354
<v Speaker 1>They are mutually intelligible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially among educated speakers and </v>

64
00:03:04.421 --> 00:03:06.850
<v Speaker 1>the formal languages are very close to </v>
<v Speaker 1>each other.</v>

65
00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:09.370
<v Speaker 1>There are some differences in the casual</v>
<v Speaker 1>language,</v>

66
00:03:09.371 --> 00:03:12.760
<v Speaker 1>especially in the accent and some of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>vocabulary that's used,</v>

67
00:03:12.761 --> 00:03:14.590
<v Speaker 1>some of the spelling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things like that,</v>

68
00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:18.130
<v Speaker 1>but basically they are one language and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they are mutually intelligible.</v>

69
00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:19.113
<v Speaker 1>One difference that I often come across </v>
<v Speaker 1>as the lone words in the different </v>

70
00:03:21.581 --> 00:03:22.414
<v Speaker 1>varieties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so in Iran there are more French loan </v>

71
00:03:24.251 --> 00:03:25.084
<v Speaker 1>words.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In Afghanistan there are more English </v>

72
00:03:26.351 --> 00:03:29.860
<v Speaker 1>loan words end in Tajikistan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are more Russian loan words.</v>

73
00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:30.753
<v Speaker 1>Some people who are not so familiar with</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Persian language might assume that </v>

74
00:03:33.371 --> 00:03:36.610
<v Speaker 1>it's related to the Arabic language </v>
<v Speaker 1>because Iran is in the middle,</v>

75
00:03:36.611 --> 00:03:37.444
<v Speaker 1>east end is next to Iraq,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but actually Persian is in a totally </v>

76
00:03:40.331 --> 00:03:41.740
<v Speaker 1>different language family.</v>

77
00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:42.573
<v Speaker 1>Then the Arabic language,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is in the Indo European language </v>

78
00:03:45.071 --> 00:03:47.320
<v Speaker 1>family.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That means that person shares historical</v>

79
00:03:47.321 --> 00:03:49.720
<v Speaker 1>origins with most of the languages in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Europe,</v>

80
00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:50.583
<v Speaker 1>including English,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as well as the languages of northern </v>

81
00:03:52.421 --> 00:03:53.254
<v Speaker 1>India,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and most speakers have Indo European </v>

82
00:03:54.761 --> 00:03:55.594
<v Speaker 1>languages find Persian much easier to </v>
<v Speaker 1>learn the Arabic because of the </v>

83
00:03:58.181 --> 00:04:01.990
<v Speaker 1>grammatical similarity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it does look like Arabic because for</v>

84
00:04:01.991 --> 00:04:05.170
<v Speaker 1>historical reasons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Persian is usually written in the Arabic</v>

85
00:04:05.171 --> 00:04:08.440
<v Speaker 1>script except in Tajikistan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's look at the history.</v>

86
00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:10.270
<v Speaker 1>First,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was old Persian,</v>

87
00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:11.133
<v Speaker 1>the oldest known records of old Persian </v>
<v Speaker 1>or in inscriptions dating back to the </v>

88
00:04:14.261 --> 00:04:17.650
<v Speaker 1>first Persian empire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These writings are written in Babylonian</v>

89
00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:20.470
<v Speaker 1>cuneiform script,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is one of the oldest writing forms</v>

90
00:04:20.471 --> 00:04:21.304
<v Speaker 1>in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have writings like this from various </v>

91
00:04:23.111 --> 00:04:25.450
<v Speaker 1>places that were part of the first </v>
<v Speaker 1>Persian empire,</v>

92
00:04:25.451 --> 00:04:28.210
<v Speaker 1>including Iran of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also Romania,</v>

93
00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:29.500
<v Speaker 1>Armenia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Iraq,</v>

94
00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:30.700
<v Speaker 1>Bahrain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Turkey,</v>

95
00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:31.600
<v Speaker 1>and Egypt.</v>

96
00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:32.433
<v Speaker 1>Next,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was middleperson from about 300 </v>

97
00:04:34.211 --> 00:04:39.100
<v Speaker 1>bce until about 800 ce old Persian </v>
<v Speaker 1>developed into middle Persian,</v>

98
00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:39.963
<v Speaker 1>which is also known as [inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can find middleperson mainly in </v>

99
00:04:42.911 --> 00:04:47.320
<v Speaker 1>religious texts of the Zoroastrian </v>
<v Speaker 1>religion from before the Islamic period.</v>

100
00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:48.273
<v Speaker 1>The language was referred to as parsing </v>
<v Speaker 1>or poor sick during this time period </v>

101
00:04:51.311 --> 00:04:53.650
<v Speaker 1>because it was the language of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>parcel of people.</v>

102
00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:54.693
<v Speaker 1>The person language entered a mysterious</v>
<v Speaker 1>new stage with the Islamic conquest in </v>

103
00:04:58.151 --> 00:04:58.984
<v Speaker 1>6:50,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one add the following 200 years are </v>

104
00:05:01.091 --> 00:05:01.924
<v Speaker 1>referred to by Iranian scholars as two </v>
<v Speaker 1>centuries of silence because there is </v>

105
00:05:06.011 --> 00:05:09.760
<v Speaker 1>very little almost no literature </v>
<v Speaker 1>available from that time period.</v>

106
00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:10.803
<v Speaker 1>We don't know exactly why,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's possible that it was forbidden </v>

107
00:05:13.841 --> 00:05:16.690
<v Speaker 1>to write in the Persian language by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Arab rulers.</v>

108
00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:20.740
<v Speaker 1>These two centuries of silence or a kind</v>
<v Speaker 1>of transition period from middle Persian</v>

109
00:05:20.741 --> 00:05:23.500
<v Speaker 1>to modern Persian and person was </v>
<v Speaker 1>affected by it.</v>

110
00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:24.353
<v Speaker 1>The Arabic language quite a lot during </v>
<v Speaker 1>this time that brings us to modern </v>

111
00:05:27.161 --> 00:05:30.280
<v Speaker 1>Persian or new Persian.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Around 800 ce.</v>

112
00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:34.270
<v Speaker 1>The person language was in danger of </v>
<v Speaker 1>being lost and replaced by Arabic,</v>

113
00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:35.133
<v Speaker 1>but Persia was one of the few places </v>
<v Speaker 1>where the Arabic language did not </v>

114
00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:39.940
<v Speaker 1>replace the local language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

115
00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.290
<v Speaker 1>Arabic was used by the intellectuals and</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the elite and it definitely had a big</v>

116
00:05:44.291 --> 00:05:47.740
<v Speaker 1>impact on the vocabulary of the modern </v>
<v Speaker 1>Persian that was emerging.</v>

117
00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:51.100
<v Speaker 1>After the end of Arab rule in Persia in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the ninth century,</v>

118
00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:51.993
<v Speaker 1>the Persian language and culture was </v>
<v Speaker 1>once again reinvigorated and a new </v>

119
00:05:54.791 --> 00:05:57.620
<v Speaker 1>period of classic literature and poetry </v>
<v Speaker 1>rose.</v>

120
00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:00.020
<v Speaker 1>One important piece of literature was </v>
<v Speaker 1>Ferdowsi.</v>

121
00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:04.610
<v Speaker 1>He's showed me the book of Kings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the longest work of epic poetry</v>

122
00:06:04.611 --> 00:06:05.444
<v Speaker 1>ever written.</v>

123
00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:09.723
<v Speaker 1>It was so influential on future </v>
<v Speaker 1>literature and cultural identity that </v>

124
00:06:13.331 --> 00:06:17.200
<v Speaker 1>the Persian language today remains </v>
<v Speaker 1>relatively unchanged from that time.</v>

125
00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:20.950
<v Speaker 1>This one epic poem is a sort of pillar </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the Persian language.</v>

126
00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:21.993
<v Speaker 1>It is said that Ferdowsi intentionally </v>
<v Speaker 1>limited the number of Arabic loan words </v>

127
00:06:25.361 --> 00:06:26.194
<v Speaker 1>used in his epic poem in order to help </v>
<v Speaker 1>preserve the integrity of the Persian </v>

128
00:06:29.531 --> 00:06:30.610
<v Speaker 1>language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

129
00:06:30.611 --> 00:06:33.820
<v Speaker 1>there's still are a significant number </v>
<v Speaker 1>of Arabic words in Persian,</v>

130
00:06:33.850 --> 00:06:37.870
<v Speaker 1>but not as many as there could have been</v>
<v Speaker 1>during this Persian cultural resurgence.</v>

131
00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:41.830
<v Speaker 1>The Persian language and culture </v>
<v Speaker 1>impacted a wide geographic area.</v>

132
00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:46.120
<v Speaker 1>Persian became the official language of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Seljuk Empire extending into present</v>

133
00:06:46.121 --> 00:06:50.260
<v Speaker 1>day Turkey and later was the first </v>
<v Speaker 1>official language of the Ottoman Empire.</v>

134
00:06:50.530 --> 00:06:53.410
<v Speaker 1>Turkish later became the official </v>
<v Speaker 1>language of the Ottoman Empire,</v>

135
00:06:53.411 --> 00:06:57.340
<v Speaker 1>but it's vocabulary had been very </v>
<v Speaker 1>influenced by Arabic and Persian,</v>

136
00:06:57.520 --> 00:06:58.353
<v Speaker 1>Persian also spread to the Indian </v>
<v Speaker 1>subcontinent where it was widely spoken </v>

137
00:07:01.511 --> 00:07:02.344
<v Speaker 1>until the arrival of the British person </v>
<v Speaker 1>has left its influence on a lot of </v>

138
00:07:05.651 --> 00:07:06.484
<v Speaker 1>different languages,</v>
<v Speaker 1>including a heavy influence on the </v>

139
00:07:08.171 --> 00:07:12.490
<v Speaker 1>vocabulary of Urdu and also some </v>
<v Speaker 1>influence on the vocabulary of Turkish,</v>

140
00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:13.473
<v Speaker 1>but you can find words of Persian origin</v>
<v Speaker 1>in languages as far away as the Malay </v>

141
00:07:16.961 --> 00:07:17.794
<v Speaker 1>language in Malaysia and of course there</v>
<v Speaker 1>are English words that are of Persian </v>

142
00:07:20.801 --> 00:07:21.250
<v Speaker 1>origin.</v>

143
00:07:21.250 --> 00:07:23.740
<v Speaker 1>Some of them came directly into English </v>
<v Speaker 1>from Persian,</v>

144
00:07:23.741 --> 00:07:27.700
<v Speaker 1>but most of them came in directly into </v>
<v Speaker 1>English via different language.</v>

145
00:07:27.910 --> 00:07:32.260
<v Speaker 1>Bizarre Bronze Jekyll Kiosk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lemon mogul,</v>

149

<v Speaker 1>Caravan Paradise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Word Checkmate actually comes from </v>

150
00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:43.873
<v Speaker 1>Sha,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which means the king is dead and maybe </v>

151
00:07:46.091 --> 00:07:50.110
<v Speaker 1>tiger though that one is disputed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Learning Persian is a great idea because</v>

152
00:07:50.111 --> 00:07:50.944
<v Speaker 1>you will be able to speak with 110 </v>
<v Speaker 1>million Persian speakers around the </v>

153
00:07:53.531 --> 00:07:54.364
<v Speaker 1>world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it also gives you access to a rich </v>

154
00:07:56.201 --> 00:08:00.940
<v Speaker 1>history of literature and insight into a</v>
<v Speaker 1>culture that has had a big impact on the</v>

155
00:08:00.941 --> 00:08:01.774
<v Speaker 1>world and if you ever decide to learn </v>
<v Speaker 1>Arabic in the future after learning </v>

156
00:08:04.691 --> 00:08:05.524
<v Speaker 1>Persian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you will already know a lot of </v>

157
