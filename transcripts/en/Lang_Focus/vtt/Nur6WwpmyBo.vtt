1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.290
<v Speaker 1>So where are you from?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2
00:00:01.291 --> 00:00:06.000
<v Speaker 1>Brazil has funded Hablo Espanol out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hello everyone.</v>

3
00:00:06.001 --> 00:00:08.640
<v Speaker 1>Welcome to the Lange focus channel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My name is Paul.</v>

4
00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.400
<v Speaker 1>Today I'm going to talk about </v>
<v Speaker 1>Portuguese.</v>

5
00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.030
<v Speaker 1>Portuguese is a language that far too </v>
<v Speaker 1>often gets ignored in Canada.</v>

6
00:00:15.031 --> 00:00:17.280
<v Speaker 1>If you tell someone you want to study </v>
<v Speaker 1>Portuguese,</v>

7
00:00:17.281 --> 00:00:18.091
<v Speaker 1>they might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

8
00:00:18.091 --> 00:00:20.910
<v Speaker 1>isn't that kind of like Spanish or worse</v>
<v Speaker 1>yet?</v>

9
00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:22.560
<v Speaker 1>They might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why Portuguese?</v>

10
00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:23.423
<v Speaker 1>Why don't you study Spanish instead?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm sure Portuguese speakers just </v>

11
00:00:26.431 --> 00:00:27.264
<v Speaker 1>love that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The truth is that Portuguese is one of </v>

12
00:00:28.981 --> 00:00:33.981
<v Speaker 1>the world's major languages with between</v>
<v Speaker 1>215 and $220 million people.</v>

13
00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.250
<v Speaker 1>It is the second most widely spoken </v>
<v Speaker 1>romance language after Spanish,</v>

14
00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.040
<v Speaker 1>like Spanish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is so widely spoken because it spread</v>

15
00:00:41.041 --> 00:00:44.070
<v Speaker 1>to the four corners of the globe during </v>
<v Speaker 1>the colonial period.</v>

16
00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:46.650
<v Speaker 1>It is the only official language in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Portugal,</v>

17
00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:48.180
<v Speaker 1>Brazil,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mozambique,</v>

18
00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:49.460
<v Speaker 1>Angola,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cape Verde,</v>

19
00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:50.580
<v Speaker 1>Guinea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bissau,</v>

20
00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:51.191
<v Speaker 1>Saulteaux,</v>
<v Speaker 1>may,</v>

21
00:00:51.191 --> 00:00:54.150
<v Speaker 1>and principate and it's co official in </v>
<v Speaker 1>East Timor,</v>

22
00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:57.390
<v Speaker 1>Ecuadorian Guinea and Macau,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like all romance languages.</v>

23
00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:58.223
<v Speaker 1>Portuguese developed from Vulgar Latin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was the spoken Latin used during </v>

24
00:01:01.411 --> 00:01:05.210
<v Speaker 1>the Roman Empire together with Castilian</v>
<v Speaker 1>Spanish along with Galician.</v>

25
00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:06.053
<v Speaker 1>And a few other languages,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it forms the Iberico Romance Branch of </v>

26
00:01:09.151 --> 00:01:09.984
<v Speaker 1>the Romance Language family.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's called [inaudible] romance because </v>

27
00:01:12.361 --> 00:01:13.194
<v Speaker 1>it's located on the Iberian peninsula </v>
<v Speaker 1>when the Romans conquered the Iberian </v>

28
00:01:16.531 --> 00:01:17.550
<v Speaker 1>peninsula,</v>
<v Speaker 1>vulgar,</v>

29
00:01:17.551 --> 00:01:19.260
<v Speaker 1>lax,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and began to be spoken there,</v>

30
00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:24.000
<v Speaker 1>and it started to diverge gradually over</v>
<v Speaker 1>time into different regional dialects.</v>

31
00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:27.420
<v Speaker 1>And by the 10th century,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those dialects had diverged enough to be</v>

32
00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.410
<v Speaker 1>considered separate languages,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but Portuguese didn't exactly exist yet,</v>

33
00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.190
<v Speaker 1>and Alisha and Portuguese also known as </v>
<v Speaker 1>Old Portuguese existed.</v>

34
00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.850
<v Speaker 1>Galician Portuguese diverged into two </v>
<v Speaker 1>separate modern languages,</v>

35
00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.880
<v Speaker 1>Galician and Portuguese by about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>16th century,</v>

36
00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.250
<v Speaker 1>although they're still quite similar </v>
<v Speaker 1>from what I hear.</v>

37
00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:50.920
<v Speaker 1>The language received its name,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Portuguese in the year 1290,</v>

38
00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:51.803
<v Speaker 1>when the king of Portugal opened the </v>
<v Speaker 1>first university in Portugal and he </v>

39
00:01:54.901 --> 00:01:57.720
<v Speaker 1>decided that the language of instruction</v>
<v Speaker 1>would not be Latin,</v>

40
00:01:57.721 --> 00:02:00.120
<v Speaker 1>but would be the vulgar Latin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the spoken language,</v>

41
00:02:00.121 --> 00:02:02.730
<v Speaker 1>and he decided to call that language </v>
<v Speaker 1>Portuguese.</v>

42
00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:05.490
<v Speaker 1>Portugal was still a relatively new </v>
<v Speaker 1>kingdom at that time,</v>

43
00:02:05.491 --> 00:02:07.740
<v Speaker 1>and the language had never been called </v>
<v Speaker 1>Portuguese yet.</v>

44
00:02:07.741 --> 00:02:08.574
<v Speaker 1>It was just called vulgar Latin and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>was not yet very distinct from the </v>

45
00:02:11.251 --> 00:02:12.084
<v Speaker 1>vulgar Latin spoken in Galicia in the 15</v>
<v Speaker 1>hundreds when the newly developed </v>

46
00:02:15.841 --> 00:02:19.050
<v Speaker 1>printing press helped make Portuguese a </v>
<v Speaker 1>standardized language.</v>

47
00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:20.003
<v Speaker 1>Portugal had already started exploring </v>
<v Speaker 1>and colonizing different areas of the </v>

48
00:02:23.041 --> 00:02:24.840
<v Speaker 1>world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bringing their language with them.</v>

49
00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:26.003
<v Speaker 1>The net result is this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Portuguese is spoken by around 10 </v>

50
00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:32.160
<v Speaker 1>million people in Portugal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it is much more dispersed around the</v>

51
00:02:32.161 --> 00:02:32.994
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is spoken by $205 million people in </v>

52
00:02:35.461 --> 00:02:38.340
<v Speaker 1>Brazil and then of course there's Africa</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Angola.</v>

53
00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.800
<v Speaker 1>It is the native language of about 5 </v>
<v Speaker 1>million people,</v>

54
00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:41.663
<v Speaker 1>20 percent of the population,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's also widely used as a lingua </v>

55
00:02:44.431 --> 00:02:47.100
<v Speaker 1>franca that unites the countries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>different ethnic groups.</v>

56
00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:50.190
<v Speaker 1>That is about 15 million more second </v>
<v Speaker 1>language speakers,</v>

57
00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:51.810
<v Speaker 1>Cape Verdi,</v>
<v Speaker 1>500,000</v>

58
00:02:51.811 --> 00:02:54.840
<v Speaker 1>people speak a Portuguese based creole </v>
<v Speaker 1>as their native language,</v>

59
00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:58.350
<v Speaker 1>but they learn Portuguese as a second </v>
<v Speaker 1>language for official purposes.</v>

60
00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:02.260
<v Speaker 1>Also in Guinea Bissau the most common </v>
<v Speaker 1>language is a Portuguese creole,</v>

61
00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:05.800
<v Speaker 1>but Portuguese is also an official </v>
<v Speaker 1>language with around 200,000</v>

62
00:03:05.801 --> 00:03:07.300
<v Speaker 1>native speakers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In Mozambique.</v>

63
00:03:07.301 --> 00:03:08.134
<v Speaker 1>There are one point $9 million native </v>
<v Speaker 1>speakers and another 10 million who </v>

64
00:03:10.631 --> 00:03:13.550
<v Speaker 1>speak it as a second language in south </v>
<v Speaker 1>Romania and prints EPA.</v>

65
00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:14.403
<v Speaker 1>It is spoken by another 120,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>people as a native language in </v>

66
00:03:17.561 --> 00:03:18.394
<v Speaker 1>Equatorial Guinea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was made an official language in </v>

67
00:03:20.291 --> 00:03:22.360
<v Speaker 1>recent years though nobody really speaks</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

68
00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:26.170
<v Speaker 1>I think they did that to promote their </v>
<v Speaker 1>relations with other Portuguese speaking</v>

69
00:03:26.171 --> 00:03:29.080
<v Speaker 1>countries in the area and let's not </v>
<v Speaker 1>forget Asia,</v>

70
00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:31.810
<v Speaker 1>Portuguese as a co official language in </v>
<v Speaker 1>East Timor,</v>

71
00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:34.780
<v Speaker 1>which was a Portuguese colony until </v>
<v Speaker 1>1975.</v>

72
00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:37.390
<v Speaker 1>Nowadays it is a co official language </v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

73
00:03:37.391 --> 00:03:38.224
<v Speaker 1>but mostly only older people can speak </v>
<v Speaker 1>it and they are almost all second </v>

74
00:03:41.141 --> 00:03:41.974
<v Speaker 1>language speakers also in Macau.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Portuguese is spoken by zero point six </v>

75
00:03:45.371 --> 00:03:46.204
<v Speaker 1>percent of the population as a native </v>
<v Speaker 1>language and it's also spoken by some </v>

76
00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:52.630
<v Speaker 1>elderly people as a second language,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not so much these days.</v>

77
00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:57.540
<v Speaker 1>There are also the former Portuguese </v>
<v Speaker 1>colonies in India specifically go up and</v>

78
00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:58.423
<v Speaker 1>do you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Portuguese is spoken by some people </v>

79
00:04:00.101 --> 00:04:00.934
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the numbers are quite small these </v>

80
00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:03.003
<v Speaker 1>days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There were also a Portuguese creole </v>

81
00:04:03.851 --> 00:04:05.950
<v Speaker 1>spoken in Malacca,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Malaysia Florists.</v>

82
00:04:05.951 --> 00:04:07.390
<v Speaker 1>Indonesia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Batticaloa,</v>

83
00:04:07.391 --> 00:04:08.224
<v Speaker 1>Sri Lanka and Aruba,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we include the second language </v>

84
00:04:10.421 --> 00:04:15.421
<v Speaker 1>speakers than there are about 250 to 260</v>
<v Speaker 1>million speakers of Portuguese.</v>

85
00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:17.920
<v Speaker 1>That does not include the creole </v>
<v Speaker 1>languages.</v>

86
00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:19.323
<v Speaker 1>Portuguese is the sixth most widely </v>
<v Speaker 1>spoken language in the world and it is </v>

87
00:04:22.751 --> 00:04:23.584
<v Speaker 1>also the most widely spoken language in </v>
<v Speaker 1>South America even though it's only </v>

88
00:04:26.351 --> 00:04:27.850
<v Speaker 1>spoken in one country there.</v>

89
00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:30.610
<v Speaker 1>Brazil,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are different accents and dialects</v>

90
00:04:30.611 --> 00:04:31.444
<v Speaker 1>of Portuguese,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the main through categories are </v>

91
00:04:32.921 --> 00:04:33.754
<v Speaker 1>European,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Portuguese which is spoken in Portugal </v>

92
00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:38.590
<v Speaker 1>and Brazilian Portuguese which is spoken</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Brazil.</v>

93
00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:39.583
<v Speaker 1>Brazilian Portuguese is similar to 18th </v>
<v Speaker 1>century Portuguese and also has some </v>

94
00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:46.870
<v Speaker 1>influences from the Indian languages and</v>
<v Speaker 1>African languages of the people who were</v>

95
00:04:46.871 --> 00:04:47.704
<v Speaker 1>present in Brazil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've read a lot of comments by lots of </v>

96
00:04:50.171 --> 00:04:53.170
<v Speaker 1>different people about this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it seems like the difference between</v>

97
00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:54.033
<v Speaker 1>Brazilian and European.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Portuguese is basically like the </v>

98
00:04:55.991 --> 00:04:59.020
<v Speaker 1>difference between UK English versus </v>
<v Speaker 1>American English.</v>

99
00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:01.690
<v Speaker 1>There is different accents,</v>
<v Speaker 1>different pronunciation.</v>

100
00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:05.620
<v Speaker 1>There are some different vocabulary </v>
<v Speaker 1>words and idioms and some of the grammar</v>

101
00:05:05.621 --> 00:05:08.410
<v Speaker 1>is slightly different,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but basically they are the same language</v>

102
00:05:08.411 --> 00:05:10.300
<v Speaker 1>and are intelligible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'll sometimes,</v>

103
00:05:10.301 --> 00:05:13.300
<v Speaker 1>depending on your exposure to the other </v>
<v Speaker 1>variety of the language,</v>

104
00:05:13.301 --> 00:05:16.810
<v Speaker 1>you might have some trouble </v>
<v Speaker 1>understanding or communicating which one</v>

105
00:05:16.811 --> 00:05:17.644
<v Speaker 1>is better to study.</v>

106
00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:18.543
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most students have Portuguese seemed to </v>

107
00:05:19.781 --> 00:05:23.380
<v Speaker 1>say that Brazilian Portuguese is easier </v>
<v Speaker 1>to learn and on top of that,</v>

108
00:05:23.381 --> 00:05:24.214
<v Speaker 1>Brazil has a huge population of over 200</v>
<v Speaker 1>million people and you're much more </v>

109
00:05:27.161 --> 00:05:29.350
<v Speaker 1>likely to meet Brazilians around the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

110
00:05:29.351 --> 00:05:32.680
<v Speaker 1>Then you are Portuguese people in my </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience on top of that,</v>

111
00:05:32.681 --> 00:05:36.550
<v Speaker 1>Brazilian soap operas are very popular </v>
<v Speaker 1>around the world and they make people in</v>

112
00:05:36.551 --> 00:05:37.384
<v Speaker 1>all Portuguese speaking countries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>quite familiar with Brazilian </v>

113
00:05:39.581 --> 00:05:41.470
<v Speaker 1>Portuguese,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so in my opinion,</v>

114
00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:42.603
<v Speaker 1>the best one to learn as Brazilian </v>
<v Speaker 1>Portuguese unless you have a specific </v>

115
00:05:45.191 --> 00:05:48.670
<v Speaker 1>plan to visit or live in Portugal and </v>
<v Speaker 1>there might be some other reasons.</v>

116
00:05:48.671 --> 00:05:49.504
<v Speaker 1>I've preferred Brazilian Portuguese,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's no need to get into that </v>

117
00:05:52.211 --> 00:05:53.044
<v Speaker 1>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you know the Iberian peninsula was </v>

118
00:05:54.911 --> 00:05:55.744
<v Speaker 1>under Islamic rule for several hundred </v>
<v Speaker 1>years and during that time Portugal </v>

119
00:05:58.551 --> 00:05:59.384
<v Speaker 1>absorbed some influence from the Arabic </v>
<v Speaker 1>language and that includes about 800 </v>

120
00:06:02.751 --> 00:06:05.000
<v Speaker 1>vocabulary words of Arabic origin.</v>

121
00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:06.860
<v Speaker 1>Something similar happened to Spanish </v>
<v Speaker 1>too.</v>

122
00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:07.813
<v Speaker 1>There are also some Portuguese words </v>
<v Speaker 1>that have made their way into the </v>

123
00:06:09.771 --> 00:06:11.840
<v Speaker 1>English vocabulary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

124
00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:13.400
<v Speaker 1>breeze,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cashew,</v>

125
00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:16.130
<v Speaker 1>Cobra,</v>
<v Speaker 1>embarrass flamingo,</v>

126
00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:18.920
<v Speaker 1>some food like Marmalade,</v>
<v Speaker 1>molasses,</v>

127
00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:23.240
<v Speaker 1>tapioca and the insect mosquito.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like most romance languages,</v>

128
00:06:23.241 --> 00:06:24.074
<v Speaker 1>Portuguese has a lot of vocabulary that </v>
<v Speaker 1>is recognizable to English speakers </v>

129
00:06:26.901 --> 00:06:29.570
<v Speaker 1>because of the French and Latin </v>
<v Speaker 1>influence on English.</v>

130
00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:32.300
<v Speaker 1>Let's look at a Portuguese sentence and </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll show you what I mean.</v>

131
00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:34.670
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Forgive my pronunciation here guys.</v>

132
00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:35.803
<v Speaker 1>Taylor swift that you mock on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dora instrument prototype forum was Eco </v>

133
00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:44.150
<v Speaker 1>North America now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so let's look at some of the words here.</v>

134
00:06:44.410 --> 00:06:46.160
<v Speaker 1>A controller,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what that looks like.</v>

135
00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:47.053
<v Speaker 1>The English word camp tour,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is someone who recites music in a </v>

136
00:06:49.701 --> 00:06:51.680
<v Speaker 1>synagogue or church.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think so.</v>

137
00:06:51.681 --> 00:06:54.860
<v Speaker 1>I think that Cantata is a singer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He told her,</v>

138
00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:56.750
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that looks like a composer.</v>

139
00:06:56.810 --> 00:06:59.780
<v Speaker 1>So I think that means musical composer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>instrument Tiesta.</v>

140
00:06:59.810 --> 00:07:00.643
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that looks like instrumentalist </v>

141
00:07:02.091 --> 00:07:05.600
<v Speaker 1>or musician and prototype that looks </v>
<v Speaker 1>like a producer.</v>

142
00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:10.460
<v Speaker 1>So prototype was eco,</v>
<v Speaker 1>must've been musical producer and then a</v>

143
00:07:10.461 --> 00:07:15.230
<v Speaker 1>three step must be an actress and not </v>
<v Speaker 1>the medical center that looks like North</v>

144
00:07:15.230 --> 00:07:17.420
<v Speaker 1>American.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you look at all of those words and</v>

145
00:07:17.421 --> 00:07:18.254
<v Speaker 1>just kind of analyze each word,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can figure out the meaning of that </v>

146
00:07:20.361 --> 00:07:21.194
<v Speaker 1>sentence pretty easily.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of Portuguese sentences are like </v>

147
00:07:23.451 --> 00:07:25.550
<v Speaker 1>that though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not always that simple,</v>

148
00:07:25.551 --> 00:07:26.384
<v Speaker 1>but I gave you a simple example just to </v>
<v Speaker 1>show you that you can often recognize </v>

149
00:07:29.601 --> 00:07:30.434
<v Speaker 1>words like that so you can probably </v>
<v Speaker 1>learn to read some Portuguese fairly </v>

150
00:07:33.201 --> 00:07:34.034
<v Speaker 1>easily.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you an English speaker and if you </v>

151
00:07:35.361 --> 00:07:38.750
<v Speaker 1>know another romance language,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you can probably already read a lot</v>

152
00:07:38.751 --> 00:07:40.670
<v Speaker 1>of it without having studied the </v>
<v Speaker 1>language.</v>

153
00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:41.713
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>learning to speak it and to write it </v>

154
00:07:42.951 --> 00:07:43.784
<v Speaker 1>will require focus and effort because </v>
<v Speaker 1>that means you have to actually produce </v>

155
00:07:46.581 --> 00:07:50.240
<v Speaker 1>the phonology and produced the grammar </v>
<v Speaker 1>as you have to with any language.</v>

156
00:07:50.540 --> 00:07:54.230
<v Speaker 1>So stop thinking of Portuguese as the </v>
<v Speaker 1>strange little brother of Spanish.</v>

157
00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:57.860
<v Speaker 1>It's actually an important global </v>
<v Speaker 1>language that stands on its own.</v>
