1
00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:05.930
<v Speaker 1>According to my research,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are 26 countries in Latin America.</v>

2
00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:10.040
<v Speaker 1>So the most widely spoken language in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the world is obviously Latin.</v>

3
00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:12.073
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

4
00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:23.483
<v Speaker 1>Good evening everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Today I'm going to talk about what are </v>

5
00:00:26.251 --> 00:00:29.400
<v Speaker 1>the most commonly spoken languages in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the world.</v>

6
00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:30.293
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people want to know that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are the most commonly spoken or </v>

7
00:00:33.271 --> 00:00:36.600
<v Speaker 1>most widely spoken languages on earth?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

8
00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:37.463
<v Speaker 1>it depends on how you measure it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It depends on whether you measure only </v>

9
00:00:40.111 --> 00:00:42.540
<v Speaker 1>native speakers or if you measure the </v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

10
00:00:42.541 --> 00:00:44.790
<v Speaker 1>the number of second language,</v>
<v Speaker 1>third language speakers,</v>

11
00:00:44.791 --> 00:00:45.970
<v Speaker 1>all that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

12
00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:46.853
<v Speaker 1>so let's just talk about a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 1>different ways to count the number of </v>

13
00:00:49.711 --> 00:00:50.544
<v Speaker 1>speakers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the first way is just by native </v>

14
00:00:51.901 --> 00:00:53.550
<v Speaker 1>speakers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we do that,</v>

15
00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.610
<v Speaker 1>then mandarin is the most widely spoken </v>
<v Speaker 1>language in the world with 1.1</v>

16
00:00:59.191 --> 00:01:02.100
<v Speaker 1>billion speakers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's billion with a b.</v>

17
00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:03.173
<v Speaker 1>And that's only Mandarin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't include all of the other </v>

18
00:01:05.341 --> 00:01:08.590
<v Speaker 1>Chinese languages in China.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

19
00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:09.563
<v Speaker 1>if you include those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that would be another couple hundred </v>

20
00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.160
<v Speaker 1>million.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But just native speakers of Mandarin 1.1</v>

21
00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:15.173
<v Speaker 1>billion.</v>

22
00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.080
<v Speaker 1>You mentioned that billion after that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Number two is English,</v>

23
00:01:19.081 --> 00:01:19.914
<v Speaker 1>which is far,</v>
<v Speaker 1>far behind with 330 million native </v>

24
00:01:23.281 --> 00:01:24.740
<v Speaker 1>speakers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

25
00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:27.870
<v Speaker 1>as you might expect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's in the top couple,</v>

26
00:01:27.871 --> 00:01:28.704
<v Speaker 1>but it's only number two after,</v>
<v Speaker 1>after Mandarin Chinese number three is </v>

27
00:01:31.921 --> 00:01:36.390
<v Speaker 1>Spanish with 300 million people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what's not far behind English?</v>

28
00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.910
<v Speaker 1>Judging by the number of native </v>
<v Speaker 1>speakers,</v>

29
00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.060
<v Speaker 1>it's not far behind English,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we'll get to that again later.</v>

30
00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:45.730
<v Speaker 1>And number four is Hindi slash or do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

31
00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.530
<v Speaker 1>that's widely considered to be the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>language.</v>

32
00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:50.393
<v Speaker 1>It's Hindi in India,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's Urdu in Pakistan or when </v>

33
00:01:53.851 --> 00:01:55.120
<v Speaker 1>spoken,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

34
00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:55.860
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

35
00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.680
<v Speaker 1>by Muslims.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you've written in the Arabic script,</v>

36
00:01:59.070 --> 00:01:59.903
<v Speaker 1>but it's usually considered the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>language because the core is the same </v>

37
00:02:02.671 --> 00:02:05.970
<v Speaker 1>and they are mutually intelligible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So same language,</v>

38
00:02:05.971 --> 00:02:06.804
<v Speaker 1>basically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Number five is Arabic with 200 million </v>

39
00:02:09.571 --> 00:02:10.404
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A Bengali with 185 million people is </v>

40
00:02:14.041 --> 00:02:15.840
<v Speaker 1>number six.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bengali is up,</v>

41
00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:16.703
<v Speaker 1>the language spoken in Bangladesh and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that area of the eastern part of Indian </v>

42
00:02:21.031 --> 00:02:26.010
<v Speaker 1>sub continent and number seven is </v>
<v Speaker 1>Portuguese with 160 million people.</v>

43
00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:28.680
<v Speaker 1>Number eight is Russian with 160 </v>
<v Speaker 1>million.</v>

44
00:02:28.681 --> 00:02:31.240
<v Speaker 1>About the same as Portuguese and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Japanese.</v>

45
00:02:31.241 --> 00:02:34.110
<v Speaker 1>122 million,</v>
<v Speaker 1>puts it at number nine,</v>

46
00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:37.050
<v Speaker 1>and then German is number 10 with a 100 </v>
<v Speaker 1>million.</v>

47
00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:40.860
<v Speaker 1>Then we have Punjabi Javanese that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>spoken in Indonesia,</v>

48
00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:44.050
<v Speaker 1>and then French is number 13.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Umm,</v>

49
00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:45.233
<v Speaker 1>so let's compare that to the number of </v>
<v Speaker 1>speakers including second language </v>

50
00:02:50.761 --> 00:02:51.594
<v Speaker 1>speakers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but proficient second language speakers </v>

51
00:02:53.401 --> 00:02:56.220
<v Speaker 1>proficient meaning that they can speak </v>
<v Speaker 1>it fairly well.</v>

52
00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:57.233
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though it's not their native </v>

53
00:02:58.081 --> 00:02:58.914
<v Speaker 1>language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So number one is still mandarin Chinese </v>

54
00:03:01.601 --> 00:03:03.640
<v Speaker 1>with 1.3</v>
<v Speaker 1>5 billion.</v>

55
00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:04.563
<v Speaker 1>So basically the speakers of all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>other Chinese languages also learn </v>

56
00:03:07.361 --> 00:03:09.880
<v Speaker 1>mandarin as the national language of </v>
<v Speaker 1>China.</v>

57
00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:15.750
<v Speaker 1>That's why there's an extra 200 or two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>250 million speakers of Mandarin Chinese</v>

58
00:03:17.741 --> 00:03:19.810
<v Speaker 1>when we include the second language </v>
<v Speaker 1>speakers.</v>

59
00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.870
<v Speaker 1>Now English is surprising one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well not surprising,</v>

60
00:03:22.871 --> 00:03:26.920
<v Speaker 1>but impressive with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's still at number two with 1.2</v>

61
00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:30.130
<v Speaker 1>billion speakers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>including the second language speakers.</v>

62
00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:34.000
<v Speaker 1>So that's quite a difference between the</v>
<v Speaker 1>number of native speakers.</v>

63
00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:37.930
<v Speaker 1>330000001.2</v>
<v Speaker 1>billion.</v>

64
00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:39.183
<v Speaker 1>So that's something like 870 million </v>
<v Speaker 1>people have learned English as a second </v>

65
00:03:44.321 --> 00:03:47.980
<v Speaker 1>language and speak it proficiently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's quite impressive.</v>

66
00:03:47.981 --> 00:03:50.410
<v Speaker 1>That's a large percentage of the world's</v>
<v Speaker 1>population.</v>

67
00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:53.050
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when we get to number three,</v>

68
00:03:53.051 --> 00:03:54.700
<v Speaker 1>there's a change.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not Spanish,</v>

69
00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:58.810
<v Speaker 1>it's Hindi and Urdu because in India and</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Pakistan,</v>

70
00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:02.080
<v Speaker 1>those languages are not the native </v>
<v Speaker 1>language of everybody.</v>

71
00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:02.943
<v Speaker 1>But a lot of people who speak a </v>
<v Speaker 1>different language learn Hindi and Urdu </v>

72
00:04:06.071 --> 00:04:08.140
<v Speaker 1>as a second language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

73
00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:09.003
<v Speaker 1>so they can communicate with speakers of</v>
<v Speaker 1>other languages in the Indian </v>

74
00:04:11.951 --> 00:04:12.784
<v Speaker 1>subcontinent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that has a 750 million proficient </v>

75
00:04:16.001 --> 00:04:18.550
<v Speaker 1>speakers if we're including second </v>
<v Speaker 1>language speakers.</v>

76
00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:21.340
<v Speaker 1>So that displaced Spanish from number </v>
<v Speaker 1>three,</v>

77
00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:22.413
<v Speaker 1>but no Spanish is still at number four </v>
<v Speaker 1>with 530 million speakers including </v>

78
00:04:26.261 --> 00:04:27.094
<v Speaker 1>second language speakers than Arabic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Still at number five with 300 and </v>

79
00:04:30.461 --> 00:04:33.400
<v Speaker 1>million,</v>
<v Speaker 1>319 million speakers.</v>

80
00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:34.503
<v Speaker 1>And that's because a lot of people in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Africa learn Arabic as a second </v>

81
00:04:37.961 --> 00:04:39.940
<v Speaker 1>language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

82
00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:44.970
<v Speaker 1>number six is French with 274 million.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So French is another one that jumped way</v>

83
00:04:45.041 --> 00:04:47.800
<v Speaker 1>up the list when we included second </v>
<v Speaker 1>language speakers.</v>

84
00:04:47.801 --> 00:04:48.634
<v Speaker 1>That's because there are a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>countries in the world where French is </v>

85
00:04:51.431 --> 00:04:55.240
<v Speaker 1>not the native language,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's the official language or it's a</v>

86
00:04:55.241 --> 00:04:59.590
<v Speaker 1>language that is spoken by a large,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a large proportion of the population,</v>

87
00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:00.453
<v Speaker 1>so that includes much of Africa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A French is widely spoken in Africa and </v>

88
00:05:04.361 --> 00:05:08.200
<v Speaker 1>a lot of different countries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's why it goes up from 75 million</v>

89
00:05:08.201 --> 00:05:09.034
<v Speaker 1>to 274 million.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's almost 200 million people speak </v>

90
00:05:12.761 --> 00:05:15.250
<v Speaker 1>French proficiently as a second </v>
<v Speaker 1>language,</v>

91
00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:19.750
<v Speaker 1>so that's quite impressive to number </v>
<v Speaker 1>seven we get a language that wasn't even</v>

92
00:05:19.751 --> 00:05:24.610
<v Speaker 1>on the list for when we calculate it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just native speakers and that is molay.</v>

93
00:05:24.611 --> 00:05:25.870
<v Speaker 1>Slash.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Indonesian.</v>

94
00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:26.973
<v Speaker 1>That's another one of those languages </v>
<v Speaker 1>that has two different names because </v>

95
00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:30.693
<v Speaker 1>people in different cultural groups or </v>
<v Speaker 1>different countries call it something </v>

96
00:05:33.521 --> 00:05:34.210
<v Speaker 1>different.</v>

97
00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:39.210
<v Speaker 1>So Malaya Malaya has Malaysian language </v>
<v Speaker 1>in Malaysia and it's Indonesian language</v>

98
00:05:39.371 --> 00:05:41.230
<v Speaker 1>in Indonesia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but same language,</v>

99
00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:42.513
<v Speaker 1>almost entirely the same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just some different vocabulary and </v>

100
00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:45.723
<v Speaker 1>different accent and that kind of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That one goes up to 270 million if we </v>

101
00:05:49.991 --> 00:05:54.660
<v Speaker 1>include second language speakers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's because in Indonesia it's,</v>

102
00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:57.410
<v Speaker 1>it's not the native language of very </v>
<v Speaker 1>many people.</v>

103
00:05:57.470 --> 00:06:01.580
<v Speaker 1>I think it's five to 10% of the people </v>
<v Speaker 1>who speak it as their native language.</v>

104
00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:05.960
<v Speaker 1>But it is the national language and </v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody learns it as the Lingua Franca</v>

105
00:06:05.961 --> 00:06:10.100
<v Speaker 1>and as a language of education that of </v>
<v Speaker 1>business and everything.</v>

106
00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:14.060
<v Speaker 1>So it doesn't have that many native </v>
<v Speaker 1>speakers,</v>

107
00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:18.560
<v Speaker 1>but it has a huge number of speak </v>
<v Speaker 1>proficient speakers,</v>

108
00:06:18.561 --> 00:06:23.510
<v Speaker 1>including second language speakers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Indonesian and Malay with 270 million</v>

109
00:06:23.511 --> 00:06:25.190
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then after that,</v>

110
00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:27.860
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't keep track of all of them.</v>

111
00:06:27.861 --> 00:06:28.694
<v Speaker 1>But it's interesting how the most </v>
<v Speaker 1>important languages are not necessarily </v>

112
00:06:32.181 --> 00:06:36.770
<v Speaker 1>the ones with the most native speakers </v>
<v Speaker 1>because languages can be important based</v>

113
00:06:36.771 --> 00:06:38.420
<v Speaker 1>on their status as a Lingua Franca.</v>

114
00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:40.340
<v Speaker 1>So we see that with melee and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Indonesian.</v>

115
00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:42.133
<v Speaker 1>So just because a language has a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>speakers doesn't necessarily mean that </v>

116
00:06:46.011 --> 00:06:50.000
<v Speaker 1>it's the most important or most </v>
<v Speaker 1>influential language on a global scale.</v>

117
00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:51.193
<v Speaker 1>So another factor that we can think </v>
<v Speaker 1>about introduced into the conversation </v>

118
00:06:55.010 --> 00:06:55.843
<v Speaker 1>is how many places that language is </v>
<v Speaker 1>spoken in over how wide of a geographic </v>

119
00:06:59.601 --> 00:07:03.050
<v Speaker 1>area is it spoken?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you think about Chinese,</v>

120
00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:07.430
<v Speaker 1>it's spoken basically only in China.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we're thinking of Mandarin,</v>

121
00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:10.430
<v Speaker 1>it's spoken in China,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's also spoken in Taiwan,</v>

122
00:07:10.730 --> 00:07:12.800
<v Speaker 1>although they claimed Taiwan as part of </v>
<v Speaker 1>China.</v>

123
00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:13.903
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's also spoken in the Chinese </v>

124
00:07:15.411 --> 00:07:19.130
<v Speaker 1>diaspora to a large extent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but basically it's only in China,</v>

125
00:07:19.370 --> 00:07:21.200
<v Speaker 1>just that one country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a big country.</v>

126
00:07:21.201 --> 00:07:23.960
<v Speaker 1>It's an important country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's only that one country.</v>

127
00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:27.770
<v Speaker 1>So does that make Chinese the most </v>
<v Speaker 1>important language?</v>

128
00:07:27.890 --> 00:07:29.540
<v Speaker 1>Is Mandarin the most important language?</v>

129
00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:32.180
<v Speaker 1>Just because it's spoken by the most </v>
<v Speaker 1>people?</v>

130
00:07:32.630 --> 00:07:36.080
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say no because on a global scale</v>

131
00:07:36.081 --> 00:07:39.350
<v Speaker 1>it's not used that much by a non native </v>
<v Speaker 1>speakers.</v>

132
00:07:39.351 --> 00:07:42.830
<v Speaker 1>And it's not used between people of </v>
<v Speaker 1>different countries as a Lingua Franca,</v>

133
00:07:42.831 --> 00:07:45.200
<v Speaker 1>it's not used as an international </v>
<v Speaker 1>language of business.</v>

134
00:07:45.201 --> 00:07:49.670
<v Speaker 1>So I would say it's not the number one </v>
<v Speaker 1>most influential or important language.</v>

135
00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:53.930
<v Speaker 1>Even though China has any emerging </v>
<v Speaker 1>country and it's a powerful country,</v>

136
00:07:53.931 --> 00:07:54.764
<v Speaker 1>an important country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's still not the most important </v>

137
00:07:56.330 --> 00:07:57.950
<v Speaker 1>language in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say it.</v>

138
00:07:58.550 --> 00:07:59.383
<v Speaker 1>English you could argue is the most </v>
<v Speaker 1>important because it has such a huge </v>

139
00:08:02.781 --> 00:08:04.700
<v Speaker 1>number of second language speakers but </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

140
00:08:04.970 --> 00:08:06.680
<v Speaker 1>but they're dispersed all over the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

141
00:08:07.070 --> 00:08:09.260
<v Speaker 1>So everywhere you can find people who </v>
<v Speaker 1>speak English.</v>

142
00:08:09.261 --> 00:08:11.900
<v Speaker 1>So it's arguably the most important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

143
00:08:11.930 --> 00:08:12.763
<v Speaker 1>Spanish is also a very important one </v>
<v Speaker 1>because Spanish is spoken in so many </v>

144
00:08:15.741 --> 00:08:17.030
<v Speaker 1>countries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

145
00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:19.070
<v Speaker 1>and it has native speakers in so many </v>
<v Speaker 1>countries.</v>

146
00:08:19.070 --> 00:08:21.180
<v Speaker 1>So Spanish could be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

147
00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:23.570
<v Speaker 1>one of the top most influential </v>
<v Speaker 1>languages,</v>

148
00:08:24.170 --> 00:08:26.660
<v Speaker 1>Arabic as well as spoken in a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>different countries.</v>

149
00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:27.793
<v Speaker 1>Arabic is a tricky one though because it</v>
<v Speaker 1>has a huge number of dialects and the </v>

150
00:08:31.131 --> 00:08:31.964
<v Speaker 1>dialects can vary quite a bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So whether you can communicate with </v>

151
00:08:36.051 --> 00:08:39.470
<v Speaker 1>speakers in a different country or not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you learn Arabic,</v>

152
00:08:39.471 --> 00:08:40.304
<v Speaker 1>that's an entirely different issue in </v>
<v Speaker 1>that complicates the matters with </v>

153
00:08:43.551 --> 00:08:44.384
<v Speaker 1>Arabic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I would say Arabic is not one of the </v>

154
00:08:46.131 --> 00:08:47.840
<v Speaker 1>most important though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

155
00:08:47.841 --> 00:08:48.674
<v Speaker 1>it's up there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's quite important and quite useful </v>

156
00:08:50.270 --> 00:08:51.103
<v Speaker 1>around the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially in Africa and the Middle </v>

157
00:08:53.210 --> 00:08:54.043
<v Speaker 1>East.</v>
<v Speaker 1>French is globally important because of </v>

158
00:08:56.881 --> 00:08:59.310
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because of all the places it's spoken.</v>

159
00:08:59.311 --> 00:09:00.144
<v Speaker 1>It's spoken in a lot of former colonies </v>
<v Speaker 1>in Asia and the Caribbean and South </v>

160
00:09:03.961 --> 00:09:05.450
<v Speaker 1>America a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

161
00:09:05.700 --> 00:09:08.610
<v Speaker 1>and especially in Africa and in many </v>
<v Speaker 1>countries.</v>

162
00:09:08.611 --> 00:09:09.720
<v Speaker 1>In Europe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>French is spoken,</v>

163
00:09:09.721 --> 00:09:10.554
<v Speaker 1>so French is also one of the most </v>
<v Speaker 1>important languages because of its </v>

164
00:09:13.441 --> 00:09:17.790
<v Speaker 1>dispersion over a large area.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say English,</v>

165
00:09:18.390 --> 00:09:20.100
<v Speaker 1>Spanish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>French,</v>

166
00:09:20.730 --> 00:09:21.563
<v Speaker 1>maybe Arabic would be the most important</v>
<v Speaker 1>on a global scale if we're thinking </v>

167
00:09:25.411 --> 00:09:29.130
<v Speaker 1>about the number of countries and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>widest geographic area.</v>

168
00:09:29.510 --> 00:09:30.343
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are just my thoughts on the </v>

169
00:09:31.171 --> 00:09:33.000
<v Speaker 1>matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are the most important,</v>

170
00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:35.520
<v Speaker 1>most widely spoken languages in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world,</v>

171
00:09:36.180 --> 00:09:37.470
<v Speaker 1>I guess.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you think?</v>

172
00:09:37.530 --> 00:09:41.700
<v Speaker 1>Which ones are the most important?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Leave your comments below and let's have</v>

173
00:09:41.701 --> 00:09:42.890
<v Speaker 1>a chat about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

174
00:09:42.900 --> 00:09:44.490
<v Speaker 1>Thank you very much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Talk to you later.</v>
