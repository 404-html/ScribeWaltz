00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:00.923
<v Speaker 1>Hello everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Today I'm going to talk about language </v>

2
00:00:02.851 --> 00:00:05.580
<v Speaker 1>learning key number two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>number two,</v>

3
00:00:05.581 --> 00:00:08.280
<v Speaker 1>which is phonology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This could be number one,</v>

4
00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:09.143
<v Speaker 1>but it just so happens that last time I </v>
<v Speaker 1>talked about a kind of a general study </v>

5
00:00:12.661 --> 00:00:13.494
<v Speaker 1>habit consistency,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but as far as practical study and </v>

6
00:00:16.021 --> 00:00:19.800
<v Speaker 1>practical skills of the language,</v>
<v Speaker 1>golf phonology could be number one.</v>

7
00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:20.963
<v Speaker 1>I really think that learning the </v>
<v Speaker 1>phonology of the language is one of the </v>

8
00:00:23.791 --> 00:00:24.624
<v Speaker 1>most important things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the basis of all of your studies </v>

9
00:00:27.031 --> 00:00:28.920
<v Speaker 1>and all of you are skills that are to </v>
<v Speaker 1>come.</v>

10
00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:32.430
<v Speaker 1>The phonology means the system of sounds</v>
<v Speaker 1>of that language,</v>

11
00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.430
<v Speaker 1>so that includes the pronunciation of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the consonants and the vowels,</v>

12
00:00:35.431 --> 00:00:38.610
<v Speaker 1>but also the stress patterns and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>intonation patterns,</v>

13
00:00:38.611 --> 00:00:40.950
<v Speaker 1>that kind of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Basically pronunciation,</v>

14
00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.900
<v Speaker 1>you could call it that same kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

15
00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:44.093
<v Speaker 1>Now it's extremely important to learn </v>
<v Speaker 1>the final logical system of each </v>

16
00:00:46.501 --> 00:00:50.640
<v Speaker 1>language you learned because it's really</v>
<v Speaker 1>what connects you to that language.</v>

17
00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:53.100
<v Speaker 1>It's the thing that associated with that</v>
<v Speaker 1>language.</v>

18
00:00:53.101 --> 00:00:55.500
<v Speaker 1>It helps you access your integrated </v>
<v Speaker 1>skills,</v>

19
00:00:55.501 --> 00:00:57.840
<v Speaker 1>your are synthesized skills in that </v>
<v Speaker 1>language.</v>

20
00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:58.763
<v Speaker 1>So what I mean by that is this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you learn a foreign language but you </v>

21
00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:02.573
<v Speaker 1>use your native languages pronunciation </v>
<v Speaker 1>or you've just pronunciation that's </v>

22
00:01:05.671 --> 00:01:08.280
<v Speaker 1>quite close to your native languages </v>
<v Speaker 1>pronunciation,</v>

23
00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:09.383
<v Speaker 1>then you're never going to fully be able</v>
<v Speaker 1>to access that foreign language or </v>

24
00:01:12.751 --> 00:01:13.584
<v Speaker 1>access your skills in that foreign </v>
<v Speaker 1>language because you'll always retreat </v>

25
00:01:16.291 --> 00:01:19.770
<v Speaker 1>into your native language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That funnel logical system is associated</v>

26
00:01:19.771 --> 00:01:22.710
<v Speaker 1>with your native language,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you want to stay away from that.</v>

27
00:01:22.711 --> 00:01:25.770
<v Speaker 1>You want to stay away from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>phonological system of your own language</v>

28
00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:26.783
<v Speaker 1>and as precisely as possible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>learn the phonological system of that </v>

29
00:01:30.001 --> 00:01:32.520
<v Speaker 1>foreign language that you are studying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In the past,</v>

30
00:01:32.521 --> 00:01:33.354
<v Speaker 1>before I really figured this out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I basically had a generic foreign </v>

31
00:01:36.481 --> 00:01:37.314
<v Speaker 1>language accent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would use the same kind of phonology </v>

32
00:01:40.261 --> 00:01:41.940
<v Speaker 1>for all the different languages I </v>
<v Speaker 1>learned.</v>

33
00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:42.773
<v Speaker 1>It was just like I had a foreign </v>
<v Speaker 1>language accent that wasn't that </v>

34
00:01:44.821 --> 00:01:46.950
<v Speaker 1>precise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it kind of work that.</v>

35
00:01:46.951 --> 00:01:49.740
<v Speaker 1>The problem was there was some crossover</v>
<v Speaker 1>between languages.</v>

36
00:01:49.741 --> 00:01:50.574
<v Speaker 1>So when I tried to speak one language,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would sometimes get mixed up and say </v>

37
00:01:53.611 --> 00:01:54.444
<v Speaker 1>words from the other language or I would</v>
<v Speaker 1>retreat into it on language that I knew </v>

38
00:01:57.241 --> 00:01:58.074
<v Speaker 1>how to speak better because that </v>
<v Speaker 1>phonology is anchored to the other </v>

39
00:02:00.901 --> 00:02:02.970
<v Speaker 1>language,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not only the one I'm learning right now.</v>

40
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.600
<v Speaker 1>So it's really important that you keep </v>
<v Speaker 1>those languages you learn as distinct as</v>

41
00:02:06.601 --> 00:02:07.434
<v Speaker 1>possible in terms of phonology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So how do you learn the phonology of a </v>

42
00:02:10.291 --> 00:02:11.124
<v Speaker 1>new language that you are studying?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well first you have to perceive the </v>

43
00:02:14.671 --> 00:02:17.010
<v Speaker 1>phonology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>perceive the sounds of that language,</v>

44
00:02:17.011 --> 00:02:20.580
<v Speaker 1>and then second you have to learn how to</v>
<v Speaker 1>produce the sounds through imitation.</v>

45
00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:21.563
<v Speaker 1>Those are the two things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's focus first on perceiving the </v>

46
00:02:24.721 --> 00:02:25.440
<v Speaker 1>sounds.</v>

47
00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:26.273
<v Speaker 1>You want to pay attention to the sounds </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the language and the distinctions </v>

48
00:02:29.071 --> 00:02:33.600
<v Speaker 1>between all of those sounds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So every beginner's language program out</v>

49
00:02:33.601 --> 00:02:34.434
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll have some kind of introduction to </v>

50
00:02:35.911 --> 00:02:36.744
<v Speaker 1>the phonology of the language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They usually call it the pronunciation </v>

51
00:02:38.821 --> 00:02:41.220
<v Speaker 1>section and it will show you all of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>consonants,</v>

52
00:02:41.221 --> 00:02:44.970
<v Speaker 1>all of the vowels in that language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And just go through the pronunciation of</v>

53
00:02:44.971 --> 00:02:47.490
<v Speaker 1>each one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe just the sound and then an example</v>

54
00:02:47.491 --> 00:02:49.800
<v Speaker 1>where it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you should of course go through that.</v>

55
00:02:49.801 --> 00:02:53.730
<v Speaker 1>You should repeat after all the sounds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>repeat after those individual words that</v>

56
00:02:53.731 --> 00:02:54.564
<v Speaker 1>they give as examples.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then you don't want to just go </v>

57
00:02:57.091 --> 00:03:00.610
<v Speaker 1>through the introductory pronunciations </v>
<v Speaker 1>of that language program.</v>

58
00:03:00.611 --> 00:03:01.444
<v Speaker 1>That wouldn't be enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's just giving you a quick idea of </v>

59
00:03:03.911 --> 00:03:04.744
<v Speaker 1>what sounds exist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you want to actually hear them over </v>

60
00:03:06.881 --> 00:03:07.714
<v Speaker 1>and over numerous times until you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>perceive them right then so you can't </v>

61
00:03:10.931 --> 00:03:12.940
<v Speaker 1>hear them and know which sound is being </v>
<v Speaker 1>said.</v>

62
00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:16.180
<v Speaker 1>So it's good to listen to some examples </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the language,</v>

63
00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:17.323
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>inaction.</v>

64
00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:18.243
<v Speaker 1>So you want to hear some radio broadcast</v>
<v Speaker 1>or some TV shows or some interviews or </v>

65
00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:25.630
<v Speaker 1>somebodies youtube channel with them </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking just like I'm talking right now,</v>

66
00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:28.210
<v Speaker 1>but in the target language that you want</v>
<v Speaker 1>to learn.</v>

67
00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:30.790
<v Speaker 1>So when you hear those sounds at a </v>
<v Speaker 1>natural speed,</v>

68
00:03:30.791 --> 00:03:31.624
<v Speaker 1>then you can start to notice and </v>
<v Speaker 1>perceive those sounds that are </v>

69
00:03:33.521 --> 00:03:36.730
<v Speaker 1>introduced in that language textbook or </v>
<v Speaker 1>on the language website.</v>

70
00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:37.593
<v Speaker 1>That's your learning from.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you don't take this time to listen </v>

71
00:03:40.031 --> 00:03:42.730
<v Speaker 1>and become familiar with the sounds of </v>
<v Speaker 1>that language,</v>

72
00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:46.090
<v Speaker 1>then what's going to happen is you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to start thinking of that language</v>

73
00:03:46.091 --> 00:03:46.924
<v Speaker 1>visually.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to start thinking of the </v>

74
00:03:47.891 --> 00:03:48.724
<v Speaker 1>language only in terms of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>orthography in terms of the way it's </v>

75
00:03:51.221 --> 00:03:52.054
<v Speaker 1>written,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you're going to think of those </v>

76
00:03:52.991 --> 00:03:56.950
<v Speaker 1>letters that you see the orthography in </v>
<v Speaker 1>terms of your own native languages,</v>

77
00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:57.813
<v Speaker 1>phonology.</v>

78
00:03:57.880 --> 00:03:59.920
<v Speaker 1>So when you imagined the letters in your</v>
<v Speaker 1>head,</v>

79
00:03:59.921 --> 00:04:02.110
<v Speaker 1>you imagine the word that you are trying</v>
<v Speaker 1>to say,</v>

80
00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:05.380
<v Speaker 1>you're going to save the sounds as you </v>
<v Speaker 1>would in your own native language.</v>

81
00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:07.480
<v Speaker 1>If it was spelled like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here in Japan,</v>

82
00:04:07.481 --> 00:04:08.314
<v Speaker 1>there's a big problem with this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I have students who learned </v>

83
00:04:10.961 --> 00:04:11.794
<v Speaker 1>English,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they learned it from someone who </v>

84
00:04:12.731 --> 00:04:13.564
<v Speaker 1>doesn't really speak English.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They learned it from a Japanese teacher </v>

85
00:04:15.731 --> 00:04:17.440
<v Speaker 1>in high school who doesn't really speak </v>
<v Speaker 1>English.</v>

86
00:04:17.441 --> 00:04:18.274
<v Speaker 1>They just taught it from the textbook.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'd teach them English in the </v>

87
00:04:21.401 --> 00:04:22.234
<v Speaker 1>Japanese phonological system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they can't even perceive the native </v>

88
00:04:25.871 --> 00:04:27.910
<v Speaker 1>English sounds often.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

89
00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:29.880
<v Speaker 1>if they read the word,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

90
00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:32.570
<v Speaker 1>ice hockey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll read it as a sewer hook.</v>

91
00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:33.413
<v Speaker 1>Gay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or if they see the word birthday cake </v>

92
00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:35.973
<v Speaker 1>written in English,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they will read it out loud as Butsu day </v>

93
00:04:38.141 --> 00:04:38.974
<v Speaker 1>cake because they are processing the </v>
<v Speaker 1>language through their own phonological </v>

94
00:04:42.701 --> 00:04:43.534
<v Speaker 1>system.</v>

95
00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:45.790
<v Speaker 1>Even if I say it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I say birthday cake,</v>

96
00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:47.080
<v Speaker 1>he'll look at me like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

97
00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:48.750
<v Speaker 1>But if I say boss today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>KCI,</v>

98
00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:52.000
<v Speaker 1>they'll understand because they're not </v>
<v Speaker 1>perceiving the English sounds.</v>

99
00:04:52.001 --> 00:04:55.360
<v Speaker 1>They're not perceiving sounds of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>word in the English phonological system.</v>

100
00:04:55.361 --> 00:04:58.660
<v Speaker 1>They're only perceiving it if I say it </v>
<v Speaker 1>in their phonological system.</v>

101
00:04:58.690 --> 00:04:59.523
<v Speaker 1>So that's the problem we want to avoid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the first thing that you have to do </v>

102
00:05:02.111 --> 00:05:05.320
<v Speaker 1>is to learn to perceive the sounds </v>
<v Speaker 1>before you produce them.</v>

103
00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:06.393
<v Speaker 1>The second thing you have to do is to </v>
<v Speaker 1>learn to produce those sounds through </v>

104
00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:11.200
<v Speaker 1>imitation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So how can you do that?</v>

105
00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:12.213
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the most basic thing you can do is to </v>

106
00:05:13.391 --> 00:05:14.224
<v Speaker 1>get a teacher or a tutor or someone who </v>
<v Speaker 1>will work with you together closely and </v>

107
00:05:17.051 --> 00:05:19.840
<v Speaker 1>monitor you and give you feedback about </v>
<v Speaker 1>your pronunciation,</v>

108
00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:20.733
<v Speaker 1>to help you to make sure that you are </v>
<v Speaker 1>saying the sounds as precisely as </v>

109
00:05:23.171 --> 00:05:26.230
<v Speaker 1>possible so that you are off to a good </v>
<v Speaker 1>start right from the beginning.</v>

110
00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:27.063
<v Speaker 1>And then you don't ingrain any bad </v>
<v Speaker 1>habits of using your own native </v>

111
00:05:30.011 --> 00:05:30.844
<v Speaker 1>languages phonology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So having a teacher or a tutor is the </v>

112
00:05:33.161 --> 00:05:35.260
<v Speaker 1>best way because they can give you that </v>
<v Speaker 1>feedback.</v>

113
00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:39.310
<v Speaker 1>They can perceive distinctions in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>sounds that you can't perceive yet.</v>

114
00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:40.473
<v Speaker 1>So it's good to have someone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're giving you feedback and helping </v>

115
00:05:42.401 --> 00:05:44.830
<v Speaker 1>you along.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But some of you like to study alone.</v>

116
00:05:44.831 --> 00:05:48.130
<v Speaker 1>You don't like to work with the teacher </v>
<v Speaker 1>right away if you're working alone,</v>

117
00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:51.280
<v Speaker 1>if you're studying by yourself with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>textbook or with some websites,</v>

118
00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:52.443
<v Speaker 1>you can do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I used to do that until the past couple </v>

119
00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:55.503
<v Speaker 1>of years and I was always fairly good </v>
<v Speaker 1>with that because I'm quite an </v>

120
00:05:57.801 --> 00:05:58.634
<v Speaker 1>independent learner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it means that you will have to </v>

121
00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:01.663
<v Speaker 1>really monitor yourself and monitor your</v>
<v Speaker 1>own pronunciation and try to </v>

122
00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:05.743
<v Speaker 1>continuously refine it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you can use language cds like the </v>

123
00:06:08.871 --> 00:06:09.704
<v Speaker 1>CDs that come with your textbook and use</v>
<v Speaker 1>that to chorus or listen and repeat </v>

124
00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:13.790
<v Speaker 1>after the CD you like.</v>

125
00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:14.623
<v Speaker 1>You can play a a sentence and then pause</v>
<v Speaker 1>it and repeat after it and try to </v>

126
00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:20.660
<v Speaker 1>pronounce it as closely as possible to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the CD.</v>

127
00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:23.590
<v Speaker 1>You can do that with a lot of youtube </v>
<v Speaker 1>clips to like watch some,</v>

128
00:06:23.910 --> 00:06:24.743
<v Speaker 1>some youtube channels or some interviews</v>
<v Speaker 1>or TV shows and play short bits and </v>

129
00:06:28.161 --> 00:06:28.994
<v Speaker 1>pause and then repeat after it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then when you get a bit better you </v>

130
00:06:31.221 --> 00:06:35.780
<v Speaker 1>can start to shadow videos or shadow </v>
<v Speaker 1>audio cds and that kind of thing.</v>

131
00:06:35.781 --> 00:06:36.614
<v Speaker 1>So shadowing means that you try to </v>
<v Speaker 1>repeat after it as they're speaking in </v>

132
00:06:39.471 --> 00:06:40.304
<v Speaker 1>real time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you kind of speak right after them </v>

133
00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:44.570
<v Speaker 1>and try to follow them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's easy to get lost doing that,</v>

134
00:06:44.571 --> 00:06:45.404
<v Speaker 1>but that's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just want to be able to shadow as </v>

135
00:06:47.331 --> 00:06:48.164
<v Speaker 1>much as you can and get.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The basic point is to continuously </v>

136
00:06:51.171 --> 00:06:53.720
<v Speaker 1>listen and produce the sounds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At the same time,</v>

137
00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:57.260
<v Speaker 1>but it's often the case that people will</v>
<v Speaker 1>do a kind of hybrid of listen and repeat</v>

138
00:06:57.620 --> 00:06:58.490
<v Speaker 1>and shadowing.</v>

139
00:06:58.490 --> 00:07:00.920
<v Speaker 1>Like they'll shadow as much as they can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when they get lost,</v>

140
00:07:00.921 --> 00:07:01.754
<v Speaker 1>they'll pause the button then and try to</v>
<v Speaker 1>finish repeating and then they'll </v>

141
00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:06.740
<v Speaker 1>unpause the button and try to continue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's,</v>

142
00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:07.603
<v Speaker 1>that's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just want to continuously hear </v>

143
00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:14.000
<v Speaker 1>native speakers and imitate them and try</v>
<v Speaker 1>to produce the same sounds that they are</v>

144
00:07:14.030 --> 00:07:14.863
<v Speaker 1>making as precisely as you can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you just need to monitor yourself </v>

145
00:07:17.781 --> 00:07:19.970
<v Speaker 1>quite a bit if you're doing this through</v>
<v Speaker 1>self study,</v>

146
00:07:20.090 --> 00:07:21.800
<v Speaker 1>but it can work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Also,</v>

147
00:07:21.801 --> 00:07:22.634
<v Speaker 1>don't forget the stress patterns and </v>
<v Speaker 1>intonation patterns because even though </v>

148
00:07:25.461 --> 00:07:26.294
<v Speaker 1>those usually aren't the introductory </v>
<v Speaker 1>sounds that you are tight in your </v>

149
00:07:28.731 --> 00:07:29.564
<v Speaker 1>language program,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those carry a lot of meaning and they </v>

150
00:07:31.821 --> 00:07:34.970
<v Speaker 1>also can mean the difference between one</v>
<v Speaker 1>word and another word,</v>

151
00:07:34.971 --> 00:07:35.804
<v Speaker 1>especially the stress patterns.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The stress panners can create </v>

152
00:07:38.031 --> 00:07:40.130
<v Speaker 1>distinctions and meanings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So don't forget about those.</v>

153
00:07:40.131 --> 00:07:41.180
<v Speaker 1>Try to imitate those.</v>

154
00:07:41.420 --> 00:07:44.200
<v Speaker 1>Those ones are not really conscious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the,</v>

155
00:07:44.390 --> 00:07:46.490
<v Speaker 1>it's difficult to consciously refine </v>
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>

156
00:07:46.491 --> 00:07:50.630
<v Speaker 1>but you just want to just pay attention </v>
<v Speaker 1>to the overall patterns of intonation.</v>

157
00:07:50.690 --> 00:07:51.523
<v Speaker 1>Repeat what you hear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and subconsciously you're going to </v>

158
00:07:53.241 --> 00:07:54.074
<v Speaker 1>internalize those patterns without </v>
<v Speaker 1>really thinking about it as long as you </v>

159
00:07:56.391 --> 00:08:01.010
<v Speaker 1>are intentionally imitating native </v>
<v Speaker 1>speakers or fluid near native speakers.</v>

160
00:08:01.011 --> 00:08:03.950
<v Speaker 1>So that is language learning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Key number two,</v>

161
00:08:03.951 --> 00:08:04.784
<v Speaker 1>it is phonology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Make sure you get the basics at the </v>

162
00:08:07.071 --> 00:08:07.904
<v Speaker 1>phonology down quite well at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>beginning before you start getting into </v>

163
00:08:10.731 --> 00:08:13.880
<v Speaker 1>learning all the grammar and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing a lot of conversation.</v>

164
00:08:13.940 --> 00:08:16.790
<v Speaker 1>Get the phonology down from day one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very important.</v>

165
00:08:16.820 --> 00:08:17.653
<v Speaker 1>It is the key to accessing that language</v>
<v Speaker 1>and not crossing wires with different </v>

166
00:08:21.831 --> 00:08:24.530
<v Speaker 1>languages and not retreating into your </v>
<v Speaker 1>native language.</v>

167
00:08:24.590 --> 00:08:27.800
<v Speaker 1>So learn the phonology and that will </v>
<v Speaker 1>help you a ton.</v>

168
00:08:28.230 --> 00:08:30.730
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is Paul signing off and have a good</v>

169
00:08:30.790 --> 00:08:35.790
<v Speaker 2>thanks.</v>
