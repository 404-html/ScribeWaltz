Hello everyone and welcome to the lange 
focus channel.

2
00:00:02,530 --> 00:00:03,363
My name is Paul.
This is another quick video about in 

3
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:06,383
linguistic concept.
This one is about something called die 

4
00:00:08,791 --> 00:00:09,624
glossier.
This word deblasio originated from a 

5
00:00:11,551 --> 00:00:14,190
Greek word meaning a state of being 
bilingual.

6
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:15,113
That glossier is a situation in which a 
community uses two different languages 

7
00:00:18,121 --> 00:00:18,954
or two significantly different varieties
of one language for different 

8
00:00:22,231 --> 00:00:23,064
situations.
The way it typically works is that one 

9
00:00:24,901 --> 00:00:25,734
dialect or language is used for casual 
everyday interaction and a different 

10
00:00:29,371 --> 00:00:30,204
standard.
Language is used for more official 

11
00:00:31,591 --> 00:00:34,590
formal purposes.
The dialect or language that is used for

12
00:00:34,591 --> 00:00:37,560
daily communication is typically a low 
variety,

13
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:38,543
meaning that it is not formally learned 
and the speakers don't formally learn 

14
00:00:41,551 --> 00:00:43,830
it's grammar or how to write in that 
language.

15
00:00:43,831 --> 00:00:45,930
It's merely learned as a spoken 
language.

16
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:49,500
The language used for more formal 
situations is the high variety.

17
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:50,393
It is the language that is learned at 
school formally and speakers learn how 

18
00:00:53,491 --> 00:00:54,324
to write in that language and they learn
the formal grammar rules of that 

19
00:00:56,701 --> 00:00:57,960
language.
In many cases,

20
00:00:57,961 --> 00:00:58,794
the community considers this high 
variety to be the pure or correct form 

21
00:01:01,831 --> 00:01:05,370
of the language and they want to keep it
the same and not let it change.

22
00:01:05,490 --> 00:01:06,323
The low variety on the other hand is 
more flexible and it's more likely to 

23
00:01:08,851 --> 00:01:09,684
change over time because it's not 
restricted by the rules of the high 

24
00:01:12,271 --> 00:01:13,104
language died.
Glossier is very common around the 

25
00:01:14,941 --> 00:01:15,774
world.
The most commonly discussed example is 

26
00:01:17,131 --> 00:01:17,964
probably the Arabic language.
In every Arabic country there are 

27
00:01:20,641 --> 00:01:22,830
different dialects that differ in 
grammar,

28
00:01:22,831 --> 00:01:25,440
vocabulary,
and pronunciation from other dialects,

29
00:01:25,441 --> 00:01:26,274
but also from standard Arabic.
Standard Arabic is a very codafide 

30
00:01:29,281 --> 00:01:30,114
language,
which is basically fixed in its rules 

31
00:01:31,531 --> 00:01:34,860
and doesn't really change while the 
dialects are constantly evolving.

32
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:35,903
In casual speech with other locals,
Arabs exclusively used their local 

33
00:01:38,731 --> 00:01:41,400
dialect,
but in writing and formal speeches and a

34
00:01:41,401 --> 00:01:42,234
news broadcast,
standard Arabic is used and standard 

35
00:01:44,611 --> 00:01:45,444
Arabic is also used as a bridge language
when communicating with speakers from 

36
00:01:48,481 --> 00:01:51,090
other dialects,
but really only when necessary,

37
00:01:51,091 --> 00:01:52,920
only when there's some trouble 
communicating.

38
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:53,963
Another example is in Italy where there 
are numerous regional languages that 

39
00:01:56,851 --> 00:01:57,684
function as the low variety.
While standard Italian functions as the 

40
00:02:00,451 --> 00:02:01,284
high variety.
These regional languages are indeed 

41
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:04,163
distinct languages.
Even though they are romance languages 

42
00:02:06,061 --> 00:02:08,730
that are related to Italian,
they are different languages,

43
00:02:08,731 --> 00:02:09,564
but they're often referred to as 
dialects because they are not formally 

44
00:02:12,151 --> 00:02:14,070
learned at school.
In recent times.

45
00:02:14,071 --> 00:02:16,380
These regional languages have faded to 
some degree,

46
00:02:16,381 --> 00:02:18,870
but die.
Glossier is still very common in Italy.

47
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:19,853
There are lots of people who speak 
original language at home or with their 

48
00:02:22,411 --> 00:02:23,244
close friends,
but with people who are less familiar 

49
00:02:24,961 --> 00:02:27,600
and informal situations,
they speak standard Italian.

50
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:28,613
Another example is the German language,
which has one high variety standard 

51
00:02:31,621 --> 00:02:35,070
German and many different low varieties.
Inside Germany.

52
00:02:35,071 --> 00:02:38,400
A lot of the low varieties have 
disappeared or are starting to fade,

53
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:40,860
but one interesting example is in 
Switzerland,

54
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:41,830
in Switzerland,
die.

55
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:42,673
Glossier is almost entirely a 
distinction between spoken 

56
00:02:45,151 --> 00:02:45,984
communication.
On the one hand and writing on the 

57
00:02:47,641 --> 00:02:48,474
other.
People in Switzerland don't really 

58
00:02:49,411 --> 00:02:52,200
accept the idea of their dialects being 
a low variety,

59
00:02:52,201 --> 00:02:55,140
so they tend to use their dialects in 
all spoken situations,

60
00:02:55,141 --> 00:02:55,974
even in formal situations and standard 
German is used only for reading and 

61
00:02:59,081 --> 00:02:59,914
writing.
For people who grew up with no real 

62
00:03:01,241 --> 00:03:05,380
distinction between a low variety and 
the high variety die glossier might seem

63
00:03:05,381 --> 00:03:08,440
like a bizarre situation that's 
difficult to wrap their head around,

64
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:12,370
but languages and the way we use them 
are fascinating and full of mystery.

65
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:13,383
The concept of Dye Glossy as one that 
will definitely come up in a lot of my 

66
00:03:15,881 --> 00:03:16,630
future videos.

67
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:18,700
So I wanted to make a quick little video
about it.

68
00:03:18,701 --> 00:03:22,690
So you're familiar with the concept.
Now I want to take a moment to say thank

69
00:03:22,691 --> 00:03:23,524
you to all of the people who have 
supported me on Patrion so far because 

70
00:03:26,351 --> 00:03:27,184
that is a tremendous help to me.
It really helps me justify the huge 

71
00:03:29,471 --> 00:03:31,810
amount of time that I invest in this 
channel.

72
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:34,600
If you find lang focus and it's video is
valuable,

73
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:35,463
the main thing that you can do to 
support the channel is to make a pledge 

74
00:03:37,901 --> 00:03:39,150
on Patrion.
Uh,

75
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:40,053
even if it's just a small amount of one 
or $2 or something that adds up and it 

76
00:03:43,151 --> 00:03:45,310
becomes a significant help to the 
channel.

77
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:46,503
Some other people have asked me how they
can make a onetime donation rather than 

78
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:53,650
making a monthly pledge on Patriarchy 
and if you look at my channel page,

79
00:03:53,651 --> 00:03:55,540
you will see a blue support button.

80
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:56,553
If you click on that button,
that's a way to make a onetime donation 

81
00:03:58,961 --> 00:03:59,794
to the channel through youtube directly.
Some of you are unable to support the 

82
00:04:02,561 --> 00:04:03,394
channel with money and that's okay,
but there are other ways that you can 

83
00:04:05,621 --> 00:04:06,454
support the channel.
You can support the channel by sharing 

84
00:04:08,771 --> 00:04:12,370
videos on facebook or by tweeting my 
videos when they're released.

85
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,233
That's a big help as well and there 
might be a few of you who want to do 

86
00:04:15,371 --> 00:04:18,070
something more significant to help out.
If that's you,

87
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:21,820
then one possibility is for you to help 
out with the Geo focus channel.

88
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:25,510
If you would like to volunteer some of 
your time to do some research or writing

89
00:04:25,511 --> 00:04:27,850
for some of my videos on the Geo focus 
channel,

90
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:28,833
then that's a possibility as well.
And if you're inexperienced editor and 

91
00:04:31,391 --> 00:04:34,510
you would like to do some editing work 
on some of the geo focus videos,

92
00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:37,270
then we can be in contact.
And discuss that as well.

93
00:04:37,330 --> 00:04:38,163
It's hard to do that with the lang focus
channel because the videos are so 

94
00:04:40,511 --> 00:04:42,880
complex and I like to be in complete 
control of them.

95
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,040
But for Geo focused,
it's a little bit easier.

96
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:46,053
So if you would like to support Lang 
Focus and geo focus in any of those 

97
00:04:48,881 --> 00:04:49,714
ways,
then that would be great and I would be 

98
00:04:50,561 --> 00:04:52,330
very grateful.
But in the meantime,

99
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,193
I appreciate your viewership.
Thank you for watching and have a nice 

100
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:56,310
day

101
00:04:56,310 --> 00:05:01,310
dish.
Oh.
