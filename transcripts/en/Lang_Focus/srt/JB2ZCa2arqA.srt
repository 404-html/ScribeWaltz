1
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:04,620
How similar are Japanese and Korean?
The.

2
00:00:04,630 --> 00:00:07,080
Hold on.
Okay.

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:12,200
Now we can start.
Hello everyone.

4
00:00:14,791 --> 00:00:17,820
Welcome to the Lange Focus Channel and 
my name is Paul.

5
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:22,530
How similar our Japanese and Korean.
That is the question of the day.

6
00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:23,603
Japan and Korea are geographically very 
close to each other and at first glance 

7
00:00:27,241 --> 00:00:30,660
they look like similar countries with 
similar cultures in a way,

8
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,470
but just how similar are the Japanese 
and Korean languages?

9
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:35,543
Well,
the short answer is they are closer to 

10
00:00:37,051 --> 00:00:37,884
each other than they are to any other 
languages and they are remarkably 

11
00:00:40,561 --> 00:00:41,394
similar in some ways,
but in other ways they're also very 

12
00:00:43,591 --> 00:00:46,710
different and they are certainly not 
mutually intelligible.

13
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:49,380
Disclaimer,
I don't speak very much Korean,

14
00:00:49,381 --> 00:00:50,214
but I do speak Japanese and I am aware 
of the differences and similarities 

15
00:00:53,521 --> 00:00:54,354
between them.
Let's look at the similarities in terms 

16
00:00:56,071 --> 00:00:57,510
of grammar,
vocabulary,

17
00:00:57,511 --> 00:00:59,700
pronunciation,
and the writing systems.

18
00:00:59,970 --> 00:01:04,050
When it comes to syntax and grammar,
Japanese and Korean are very similar.

19
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:05,093
Japanese and Korean sentences can often 
be translated word by word with each 

20
00:01:08,971 --> 00:01:11,880
word in one sentence,
having an equivalent in the other.

21
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:15,480
Let's look at a couple of Korean and 
Japanese sentences side by side,

22
00:01:15,481 --> 00:01:17,550
and we can see the similarities.
Again,

23
00:01:17,551 --> 00:01:20,940
I don't really speak much Korean,
so with my pronunciation is terrible.

24
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,250
Koreans,
please forgive me in English,

25
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:25,560
I am a student in Korean.
None.

26
00:01:25,570 --> 00:01:29,340
Then huck saying either in Japanese,
what Tashi duck say this.

27
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:33,750
You can see that these sentences are 
translatable word by word that each word

28
00:01:33,751 --> 00:01:37,530
in the first sentence has an equivalent 
in the second sentence in the exact same

29
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:40,080
position,
so if they are directly translatable.

30
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:43,620
One thing I want to point out is the 
topic marker.

31
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:46,290
That's the second word.
In each of these sentences,

32
00:01:46,291 --> 00:01:47,130
that topic,
Margaret,

33
00:01:47,131 --> 00:01:50,100
is something that's kind of unique to 
Japanese and Korean topic.

34
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:50,933
Marker points out the topics of a 
sentence that's different from the 

35
00:01:53,431 --> 00:01:54,264
grammatical subject,
the overarching focus or topic of the 

36
00:01:56,791 --> 00:01:59,040
sentence.
Another thing I want to point out is the

37
00:01:59,041 --> 00:02:00,240
last word.
In each sentence.

38
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:03,500
In Korean it's EDA and in Japanese it's 
destitute.

39
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:08,280
In both cases that's like a popular,
like the word is in English,

40
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:11,940
so in both Japanese and Korean.
This is a standalone word that is placed

41
00:02:11,941 --> 00:02:16,941
usually at the end of the sentence in 
Korean and undone in Japanese.

42
00:02:21,061 --> 00:02:22,800
What does you up and easily will know me
much,

43
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:23,903
so again,
we see that the topics marker is the 

44
00:02:25,501 --> 00:02:26,334
second word in each sentence,
but a more important thing that I want 

45
00:02:28,351 --> 00:02:32,340
to point out here is the Sov word order.
That means subject,

46
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:33,450
object,
verb,

47
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:37,710
so we can see that the subject is what?
Touchy or it's not in Korean,

48
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:41,580
and then we have the object next to the 
object is water.

49
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:42,623
In Korean it's and in Japanese it's 
music and then we have the verb at the 

50
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:47,783
end.
So in Korean law seemed that Indian 

51
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,113
Japanese nomi must,
but before the verb there is an 

52
00:02:53,791 --> 00:02:54,624
interesting little word that we don't 
have an English and that is an object 

53
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:58,253
marker.
So that's another thing that we find in 

54
00:03:00,491 --> 00:03:01,324
both Japanese and Korean used in exactly
the same way in exactly the same 

55
00:03:04,541 --> 00:03:05,374
position in the census,
even though the grammar and sentence 

56
00:03:07,601 --> 00:03:10,210
structure of the two languages is 
remarkably similar,

57
00:03:10,211 --> 00:03:11,044
the vocabulary is remarkably different.
If a Japanese speaker heard Korean 

58
00:03:14,411 --> 00:03:18,040
without any prior exposure,
they probably wouldn't understand any of

59
00:03:18,041 --> 00:03:20,680
the words at all or maybe just a word 
here and there,

60
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:23,290
but that doesn't mean that those words 
aren't related.

61
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:28,270
Korean and Japanese both inherited a 
large number of loan words from Chinese.

62
00:03:28,450 --> 00:03:32,410
Approximately 60 percent of the 
vocabulary in either language comes from

63
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:33,273
Chinese.

64
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,990
If there are so many Chinese loan words 
in both languages,

65
00:03:35,991 --> 00:03:38,230
then why are they not mutually 
comprehensible?

66
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:39,423
Well,
it's important to note that for both 

67
00:03:40,151 --> 00:03:43,720
languages in daily conversation and 
informal speech,

68
00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:47,530
that Chinese loan words are not used 
nearly as much as they are in writing.

69
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:48,993
Also,
the Chinese loan words are different in 

70
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:54,100
either language to enter the languages 
in the form of Chinese characters,

71
00:03:54,101 --> 00:03:54,934
but the pronunciation of those 
characters became adapted to fit the 

72
00:03:57,761 --> 00:04:02,080
phonological system of either language.
So let's look at some examples.

73
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:05,740
The first example is just the name of 
those Chinese characters themselves.

74
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:08,350
In Chinese,
in Korean,

75
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:09,423
I'm job in Japanese Kanji so you can see
that the pronunciation started as an 

76
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,233
answer,
but it diverged and became different in 

77
00:04:17,771 --> 00:04:18,604
Korean and Japanese even though it's the
same two characters at some other 

78
00:04:21,911 --> 00:04:22,744
examples in Korean sap team in Japanese,
Shashi and photograph the were forcing 

79
00:04:27,391 --> 00:04:28,840
her in Korean.

80
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:34,480
In Japanese costumes.
The word for promise in Korean.

81
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:36,760
Yuck.
Sold in Japanese.

82
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:37,713
Yeah,
because so cute.

83
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:38,673
Those examples sound quite similar,
but sometimes they sound really quite 

84
00:04:41,321 --> 00:04:43,570
different,
but if we look at the romanized world,

85
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:48,190
sometimes we can see the similarities.
This is the word for telephone in Korean

86
00:04:48,670 --> 00:04:49,503
children.
Wow.

87
00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:51,180
In Japanese then?
Well,

88
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:54,100
so those come from the same characters,
but again,

89
00:04:54,101 --> 00:04:56,230
they're rendered differently in 
pronunciation.

90
00:04:57,030 --> 00:05:01,760
The next word is school in Korean.
How you'll in Japanese got cold.

91
00:05:02,810 --> 00:05:03,643
Another example is university in Korean,
in Japanese got Tofu in Korean to boot 

92
00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:12,483
in Japanese soul food.
The word for SPA or hot spring in 

93
00:05:15,461 --> 00:05:16,690
Korean.
On John,

94
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:17,853
in Japanese on sand.
So you can see that sometimes the words 

95
00:05:20,651 --> 00:05:21,484
are clearly related,
but when you're listening to the 

96
00:05:23,051 --> 00:05:23,884
language being spoken,
you probably wouldn't be able to catch 

97
00:05:25,931 --> 00:05:28,330
those words.
Chinese loan words aside.

98
00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:31,840
There are also some Japanese loan words 
that have entered the Korean language.

99
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,033
The word for cheers when you're having a
drink and Korean going pay in Japanese 

100
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,530
come by.
The Japanese word for bag in Korean it's

101
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:44,180
in Japanese.
It's come on.

102
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:45,243
There are also a lot of words that are 
native to both Korean and Japanese that 

103
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:51,640
might be related to each other.
The word for island in Korean,

104
00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:56,170
in Japanese Shima the word for village 
in Korean.

105
00:05:57,170 --> 00:05:58,520
In Japanese,
Buddha.

106
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,970
There are a lot of words like that that 
I don't really think are connected,

107
00:06:01,971 --> 00:06:05,390
but linguists think might be connected.
Interestingly though,

108
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:06,253
some of the grammatical particles have 
very similar pronunciations in the two 

109
00:06:09,201 --> 00:06:10,550
languages.
For example,

110
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:11,413
the word for above.
In Korean we ate in Japanese who a 

111
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:18,680
question particle co in Korean,
the double continent,

112
00:06:18,681 --> 00:06:22,250
the Double Cup in.
In Japanese it's cut the word for two or

113
00:06:22,251 --> 00:06:22,880
towards.

114
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:26,900
In Korean it's a and in Japanese it's a 
the subject marker,

115
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,690
so this is different from the topic.
Margaret,

116
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,470
the subject marker is in Korean,
got for eat in Japanese,

117
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:34,333
it's just got so basically Korean and 
Japanese have a lot of vocabulary that 

118
00:06:38,121 --> 00:06:38,954
are related but not the same.
It's probably enough to help you 

119
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:42,553
remember that word if you study it,
but not necessarily enough to pick up 

120
00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:48,680
that word when you're hearing it in 
conversation,

121
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:49,663
and of course most of the spoken 
vocabulary seems to be unrelated or 

122
00:06:52,521 --> 00:06:55,640
they're words that have very ancient 
connections to each other.

123
00:06:55,850 --> 00:06:59,000
Now let's look at the different 
pronunciation of the two languages.

124
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,073
In some ways they're similar.
The basic phonetic sounds of the two 

125
00:07:02,241 --> 00:07:03,074
languages are quite similar,
but the way those phonetic sounds are 

126
00:07:05,571 --> 00:07:08,690
arranged to create syllables is 
different in the two languages.

127
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:12,440
In Japanese,
basically every syllable has to end in a

128
00:07:12,441 --> 00:07:12,830
vowel.

129
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:15,980
You cannot have a word that ends in a 
solid consonant like cut.

130
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:19,640
It has to be something like customer 
with a vowel added to the end,

131
00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:23,330
but in Korean you can have a consonant 
at the end of a syllable.

132
00:07:23,570 --> 00:07:27,200
That's why in one of the words that we 
compared before the word promise,

133
00:07:27,470 --> 00:07:29,140
in Japanese,
it's yet grew so poor.

134
00:07:29,210 --> 00:07:31,130
You need those vowels after the 
continence,

135
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:32,023
but in Korea,
and it's yet another difference is that 

136
00:07:34,551 --> 00:07:35,384
in Japanese,
the pronunciation of consonants doesn't 

137
00:07:37,311 --> 00:07:39,620
change depending on their position in 
the word,

138
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:40,513
they just are always the same,
but in Korean there are consonants and 

139
00:07:43,011 --> 00:07:43,844
that can change depending on whether 
they're at the beginning of the word in 

140
00:07:46,371 --> 00:07:48,600
the middle of the word or at the end of 
the word.

141
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:52,670
Korean also has a greater variety of 
vowels and diphthongs,

142
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:53,773
so in general,
Korean pronunciation is just more 

143
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:56,473
complex than Japanese pronunciation.
One thing that is completely different 

144
00:07:59,811 --> 00:08:02,270
between the two languages is there 
writing systems.

145
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:07,510
Japanese is written using a combination 
of Chinese characters and two syllables.

146
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:08,813
Those is consist of characters that 
represent entire syllables rather than 

147
00:08:12,351 --> 00:08:13,184
just individual phonetic sounds.
The Japanese writing system is quite 

148
00:08:16,221 --> 00:08:17,054
complex and since you need to learn more
than 2000 congee to be able to read at 

149
00:08:20,481 --> 00:08:21,314
an adult level,
it can take quite a lot of time and 

150
00:08:22,971 --> 00:08:24,410
effort to learn.
Korean,

151
00:08:24,411 --> 00:08:26,870
on the other hand,
is written in the humble alphabet,

152
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:29,810
which is one of the simplest writing 
systems in the world.

153
00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:33,620
Korean used to use Han Chinese 
characters in the same way that Japanese

154
00:08:33,621 --> 00:08:36,930
uses congee and combination with Ido 
gonna Kinda Kinda.

155
00:08:37,310 --> 00:08:38,143
But they've done away with that and now 
they're just using the simplified 

156
00:08:39,861 --> 00:08:41,900
writing system of humble,
humble.

157
00:08:41,901 --> 00:08:42,734
Alphabet consists of individual phonetic
symbols that are arranged together to 

158
00:08:46,011 --> 00:08:49,110
create syllables.
In this example for hunch,

159
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:51,830
this is the sound for like an h.

160
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:55,320
This is the sound.
This is the sound for like an end.

161
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:58,620
This is the sound for a job for sure.
And this is ah,

162
00:08:58,930 --> 00:08:59,763
so whereas Japanese requires you to 
learn 92 syllabary symbols and 2000 

163
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:04,733
congee in Korea and you just have to 
learn 24 phonetic symbols and you can 

164
00:09:08,581 --> 00:09:11,130
use those to represent any new words 
that you learned.

165
00:09:11,730 --> 00:09:12,563
So to summarize,
Korean and Japanese are very similar in 

166
00:09:15,031 --> 00:09:15,864
terms of sentence structure and grammar 
and they both have a large number of 

167
00:09:18,691 --> 00:09:19,524
Chinese loan words,
but the native vocabularies are quite 

168
00:09:22,021 --> 00:09:22,854
different as is the pronunciation which 
makes these two languages mutually 

169
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:28,260
unintelligible.
On top of that,

170
00:09:28,290 --> 00:09:31,620
the two writing systems are now 
completely different with the new modern

171
00:09:31,710 --> 00:09:32,543
Korean system,
completely avoiding Chinese characters 

172
00:09:34,591 --> 00:09:35,424
these days.
My feeling is that Japanese and Korean 

173
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:41,070
did originate from the same language a 
very long time ago,

174
00:09:41,071 --> 00:09:43,290
but they've been diverging for a long 
time,

175
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:44,124
perhaps about 2000 years so that now 
they're very different even though 

176
00:09:46,741 --> 00:09:47,574
structurally they're quite similar.
Thank you for watching the Lang focus 

177
00:09:50,161 --> 00:09:51,840
channels.
Leave your comments down below,

178
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:52,733
especially if you have studied Japanese 
or Korean and you can let us know about 

179
00:09:56,041 --> 00:09:59,130
some other similarities or differences 
that you have discovered.

180
00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:01,770
Thank you for watching and have a nice 
day.
