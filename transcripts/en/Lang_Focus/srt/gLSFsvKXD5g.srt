1
00:00:02,450 --> 00:00:05,040
[inaudible] been definitely towards 
canal.

2
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:15,310
Good evening folks.
Today I want to talk about uh,

3
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:19,740
studying Japanese and the most useful 
materials for learning Japanese.

4
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:20,813
Obviously I haven't used all the 
different materials in the world for 

5
00:00:24,061 --> 00:00:24,894
studying Japanese,
but I have to do some and that's 

6
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:27,203
familiar with others to some extent.
So I'll tell you about what I think and 

7
00:00:30,061 --> 00:00:30,894
my experience.
One of the good things about studying 

8
00:00:33,001 --> 00:00:36,990
Japanese is that there is such a wide 
range of good materials.

9
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:37,710
Uh,
there's just,

10
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:38,543
there's a lot out there to choose from.
So you can go to the bookstore and look 

11
00:00:40,801 --> 00:00:43,500
through a bunch of books and see which 
ones appeal to you.

12
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:44,813
Uh,
it comes down to learning style and 

13
00:00:45,901 --> 00:00:49,050
taste to some extent,
but I'll just get into it.

14
00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:49,903
Uh,
the first series that I used was called 

15
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:54,390
Japanese for busy people.
So there are,

16
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:56,520
uh,
well the title was always kind of funny.

17
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:59,340
I don't know why it's for busy people.
Why not for business people?

18
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:03,240
The content of this series is basically 
for business.

19
00:01:03,241 --> 00:01:04,074
It's for simple business situations 
where like do you go on a business trip 

20
00:01:07,681 --> 00:01:10,710
to Tokyo when you talked to like a,
what was it,

21
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:11,993
uh,
Mr Tanaka from Tokyo Electric and that 

22
00:01:14,281 --> 00:01:16,320
kind of thing.
So the situations are kind of business.

23
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:17,543
I found that aspect of it a little 
boring because I was never working in 

24
00:01:21,031 --> 00:01:23,550
business in Japan.
I came here as a teacher,

25
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:27,060
um,
so that it might not be relevant for you

26
00:01:27,061 --> 00:01:27,894
in terms of content and completely,
but it's a good series and if you go 

27
00:01:30,481 --> 00:01:32,520
through volumes one,
two and maybe three,

28
00:01:32,521 --> 00:01:34,050
you'll learn quite a bit.
Uh,

29
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:35,730
it's quite well laid out.
Uh,

30
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:38,940
it has like a short conversation in each
chapter.

31
00:01:38,941 --> 00:01:42,510
Then it introduces the vocabulary and 
some grammar from,

32
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:43,643
uh,
from that conversation and gives you 

33
00:01:44,491 --> 00:01:46,020
some exercises to practice it.

34
00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:47,700
And it's quite,
quite good,

35
00:01:47,701 --> 00:01:49,680
useful,
standard Japanese.

36
00:01:49,681 --> 00:01:52,290
And I think it's a good series.
Um,

37
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:55,290
there's another popular series called,
uh,

38
00:01:55,291 --> 00:01:58,740
it's called [inaudible] or a Japanese 
for every one.

39
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:03,060
And that one is quite good as well.
I haven't used the whole thing,

40
00:02:03,061 --> 00:02:05,430
but I've looked through it and it looks 
quite good.

41
00:02:05,431 --> 00:02:09,270
And a lot of people swear by it.
So that's another one to think about is,

42
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:13,050
I mean Danone Hong Kong or Japanese for 
everyone as it's called.

43
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:17,910
Another series I used was one that's 
only published in Vancouver.

44
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:21,750
It's published at a Japanese language 
school in Vancouver,

45
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:26,180
I think it's called Nakagawa language 
center and it's called gum bucket.

46
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:28,440
That's the name of the series.
And that one was really good.

47
00:02:28,441 --> 00:02:30,420
It was really fun.
It was really motivating.

48
00:02:30,421 --> 00:02:31,254
I really liked that.
The best as a like a pure beginners 

49
00:02:33,871 --> 00:02:36,360
textbook or five volumes,
five volumes.

50
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:38,700
Um,
number one is really simple,

51
00:02:38,701 --> 00:02:41,700
but it goes up to five and if you finish
up to volume five,

52
00:02:41,701 --> 00:02:44,900
that prepares you for the first level of
the Japanese proficiency test.

53
00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:46,063
Uh,
but all the conversations and the 

54
00:02:46,771 --> 00:02:51,150
characters and stuff were quite cute and
I'm quite motivating.

55
00:02:51,151 --> 00:02:53,760
They got me interested in learning 
Japanese more.

56
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:55,710
Let me just double check the name of 
that center.

57
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:56,911
No,
not knock a Gullah,

58
00:02:56,911 --> 00:03:01,060
sorry to Nina Ogawa Japanese language.
So it's hard to get those books.

59
00:03:01,061 --> 00:03:04,240
I don't know if you can find the 
[inaudible] gum but day series,

60
00:03:04,241 --> 00:03:05,074
but if you can find it online,
I think you can order it through the 

61
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:11,710
website of new gala.com.
So have a look if you can get it.

62
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:14,950
It's good for beginners,
at least the lower levels.

63
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:18,850
So those were the beginning textbooks at
an intermediate level.

64
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:19,923
I loved this book,
this one and integrated approach to 

65
00:03:22,691 --> 00:03:25,780
intermediate Japanese by a Kiddo Muda.

66
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:30,070
And now when we Hanukkah mcgloin,
this one was awesome.

67
00:03:30,071 --> 00:03:32,410
This made me really love studying 
Japanese.

68
00:03:32,770 --> 00:03:34,810
Uh,
the way it was laid out.

69
00:03:35,070 --> 00:03:37,150
The conversations were fun and 
interesting.

70
00:03:37,151 --> 00:03:41,290
The stories and texts were interesting 
and it wasn't focused on business.

71
00:03:41,291 --> 00:03:44,560
It was focused on college life.
And I wasn't a student,

72
00:03:44,561 --> 00:03:45,394
but I had been a student so I could 
relate to college life a little bit 

73
00:03:47,891 --> 00:03:51,730
better than corporate life.
So the vocab and the topics and just the

74
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:54,550
whole theme of this book was more 
interesting to me.

75
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,073
Some people don't seem to like it.
I've read some of the reviews on Amazon 

76
00:03:58,391 --> 00:04:00,520
and some people say they find it hard to
follow.

77
00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:02,830
Um,
it might depend on your learning style.

78
00:04:02,831 --> 00:04:03,664
Like I'm a very inductive learner.
I like to look at texts and 

79
00:04:05,741 --> 00:04:09,160
conversations and kind of figure out 
what's going on and look at the pieces.

80
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:10,990
And God,
this piece must be the verb.

81
00:04:10,991 --> 00:04:13,870
This must be the whatever.
I like to figure things out.

82
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:15,153
Um,
and that works well with this book 

83
00:04:17,081 --> 00:04:19,960
because it's the beginning of each 
chapter and it will have like,

84
00:04:20,030 --> 00:04:20,863
uh,
like two or three different 

85
00:04:21,641 --> 00:04:24,430
conversations or texts.
So if we look at this one,

86
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:28,120
it's got one conversation,
then it's got another one,

87
00:04:28,121 --> 00:04:31,720
then it's got another one,
and then after that it's got a text.

88
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,450
And then after that it has the 
vocabulary.

89
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:36,640
And after the vocabulary,
then it has,

90
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:39,790
uh,
that's the congee.

91
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:41,103
Then after that it has the grammar 
points and then it has a grammar 

92
00:04:42,881 --> 00:04:44,720
exercises.
So the,

93
00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:45,643
the texts and the conversations are 
separate from all of the breakdown and 

94
00:04:49,841 --> 00:04:52,870
the explanation and the exercises.
Those come after the texts.

95
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:54,550
So for me,
that's fine.

96
00:04:54,551 --> 00:04:55,384
I like to look at the text and the 
conversations and then flip back to the 

97
00:04:58,061 --> 00:04:59,350
explanations when I need it.

98
00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:00,303
And then I can figure out the other 
things on my own to whatever extent I 

99
00:05:03,641 --> 00:05:04,474
can.
Then I can just flip back if I need an 

100
00:05:05,681 --> 00:05:08,230
explanation.
Some people like to have the explanation

101
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,270
right up front in their face from the 
beginning.

102
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:12,430
They're more deductive learners.
Uh,

103
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:16,660
they like to have it explained to them 
before they read the text or at the same

104
00:05:16,661 --> 00:05:18,970
time.
So if you are like that,

105
00:05:18,971 --> 00:05:21,670
you might not like this book that much,
but have a look at it.

106
00:05:21,671 --> 00:05:24,250
I really liked it and this was my 
favorite book ever.

107
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:28,360
So another one at the intermediate level
was this one,

108
00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:31,510
which I didn't like.
I didn't have as much fun with it,

109
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,700
but it was useful.
It taught me a lot.

110
00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:35,050
It's this one,
uh,

111
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:37,310
[inaudible],
uh,

112
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:40,330
that means Japanese from the 
intermediate level.

113
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:42,670
That's the name,
that's the meaning of this title.

114
00:05:42,910 --> 00:05:47,910
But this one is completely in Japanese.
This other one and integrated approach.

115
00:05:48,401 --> 00:05:49,234
The one I showed you before,
this has a lot of English in it and has 

116
00:05:50,891 --> 00:05:54,550
translations and explanations.
This one is all in Japanese.

117
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:56,690
So this one is a bit more,
uh,

118
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:59,570
intense of an experience because you 
have to dive right in.

119
00:05:59,571 --> 00:06:01,400
It's all Japanese,
no explanations.

120
00:06:01,401 --> 00:06:04,910
It doesn't even have a title in English.
When I looked this up on Amazon to check

121
00:06:04,911 --> 00:06:06,440
if it's available,
uh,

122
00:06:06,441 --> 00:06:07,380
I had,
uh,

123
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:11,390
I had to type in the espn number because
when I typed in the Japanese,

124
00:06:11,391 --> 00:06:13,940
it didn't show up because it was 
amazon.com

125
00:06:13,941 --> 00:06:15,560
in America.
But,

126
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:17,450
uh,
if I looked up the espn,

127
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,313
then this name,
this title appeared in Roman characters 

128
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:23,480
in Amazon.
So it doesn't even have an English name.

129
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:25,180
You would have to look up.
Uh,

130
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:28,580
maybe I'll put the ISB and on the screen
so you can look it up if you want.

131
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:30,410
Um,
but this one's good.

132
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:32,570
It's,
it has great texts.

133
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:35,420
The texts are interesting stories and 
um,

134
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:38,740
and uh,
there's a lot of stories and there's,

135
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:43,370
there are some explanations of proverbs 
and different expressions in Japanese.

136
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:44,413
Uh,
I found it really useful to just go 

137
00:06:45,321 --> 00:06:48,770
through the stories and highlight 
vocabulary I didn't know,

138
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:54,070
and then look at the vocabulary lists 
and the grammar exercises after,

139
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:57,583
after the stories.
I found it a bit hard to do all of the 

140
00:07:00,141 --> 00:07:04,250
exercises without a classroom teacher.
I did this on my own at home.

141
00:07:04,670 --> 00:07:05,503
I've actually never taken the Japanese 
lesson in my life and I did it all 

142
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:09,860
through self study.
Um,

143
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:14,600
I found it a bit hard to do this all at 
home self study style,

144
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:17,150
but I got through it and it was a bit of
hard work,

145
00:07:17,151 --> 00:07:19,640
but I learned a lot from it.
So this one is good.

146
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:20,593
It's good material.
Just if you have a teacher it will be 

147
00:07:22,341 --> 00:07:24,620
easier for you cause they can help you 
out with,

148
00:07:24,630 --> 00:07:25,463
um,
with the exercises when the explanation 

149
00:07:27,591 --> 00:07:30,440
in Japanese is not quite clear.
All right,

150
00:07:30,441 --> 00:07:33,380
so that was intermediate level.
At a more advanced level.

151
00:07:33,381 --> 00:07:37,700
I used this one,
a Gq collagio cue and on your own goals.

152
00:07:37,701 --> 00:07:41,720
So that's Japanese from the intermediate
level to the advanced level.

153
00:07:41,721 --> 00:07:43,730
That's what that title means.
Um,

154
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:44,953
or as they say,
progressing from intermediate to 

155
00:07:46,881 --> 00:07:47,840
advanced,
that's uh,

156
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:51,080
that's the way they translated it.
So this one was pretty good.

157
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:51,943
Um,
it was kind of a bridge between 

158
00:07:53,661 --> 00:07:54,494
intermediate to advanced.
I got about halfway through this book 

159
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:58,730
and it was good.
It was useful.

160
00:07:58,731 --> 00:08:00,250
I learned a lot from it.
Uh,

161
00:08:00,530 --> 00:08:01,363
but I started using authentic materials.
Instead I started just using newspapers 

162
00:08:04,881 --> 00:08:07,550
and,
and texts from magazines and just trying

163
00:08:07,551 --> 00:08:09,470
to work through those and learn 
vocabulary.

164
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:11,840
But this is good.
It's similar to the,

165
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:15,770
to the integrated approach to 
intermediate Japanese won't like,

166
00:08:15,771 --> 00:08:16,604
it has texts that are interesting and 
then it breaks it down with the vocab 

167
00:08:19,641 --> 00:08:22,370
and the grammar exercises afterwards.
Um,

168
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:26,060
I found it quite similar in format and 
just interesting to use,

169
00:08:26,450 --> 00:08:27,283
but at that level I just thought it's 
better to get into the authentic 

170
00:08:29,901 --> 00:08:31,820
materials.
Okay.

171
00:08:31,821 --> 00:08:32,654
So those are the ones that I have used 
and I think are pretty good and I 

172
00:08:35,211 --> 00:08:37,370
recommend,
I've used some others here and there.

173
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:38,493
Uh,
and I use some different ones for 

174
00:08:39,201 --> 00:08:40,034
Congee,
which I'll probably talk about in a 

175
00:08:41,301 --> 00:08:42,134
different video cause Kanji is a 
different beast entirely and deserves 

176
00:08:45,171 --> 00:08:47,930
its own attention.
But I recommend all those,

177
00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:48,823
especially this one,
which was my favorite integrated 

178
00:08:52,701 --> 00:08:55,040
approach to intermediate Japanese.
But if you're a beginner,

179
00:08:55,050 --> 00:08:55,883
then you could get me not only Hong Kong
or you could get Japanese for busy 

180
00:08:59,131 --> 00:09:00,900
people and work through it.

181
00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:04,950
One more note on Japanese for busy 
people get the Kona version.

182
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:06,203
Don't get the romanized version.
There are to the romanized means it's 

183
00:09:08,821 --> 00:09:09,690
written in.
Well,

184
00:09:09,691 --> 00:09:12,990
it has Roman characters in it and I 
think it has the Japanese as well.

185
00:09:13,290 --> 00:09:14,160
But,
um,

186
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:15,143
I don't recommend using the romanized 
version because you might use the Roman 

187
00:09:19,141 --> 00:09:19,974
letters as a crutch.
It's good to get used to the corner 

188
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:25,170
letters right away from the beginning.
Just dive right in.

189
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:29,100
You can learn them very quickly if you 
dive in and make yourself do it.

190
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:31,200
So make yourself do it.
All right.

191
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,540
I hope that's helpful.
Have a nice night guys.

192
00:09:33,690 --> 00:09:34,523
See Ya.

193
00:09:38,570 --> 00:09:39,403
Okay.
