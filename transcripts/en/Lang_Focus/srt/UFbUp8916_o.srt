00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:09,653
Hello everyone.
Welcome to the Lange Focus Channel and 

2
00:00:11,171 --> 00:00:12,004
my name is Paul.
Today I'm going to talk about the 

3
00:00:13,771 --> 00:00:16,590
Kurdish language,
whereas Curtis Spoken,

4
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:18,090
well,
that's an interesting question.

5
00:00:18,091 --> 00:00:21,630
Kurdish is the language of the Kurdish 
people and ethnic group who did not have

6
00:00:21,631 --> 00:00:22,464
their own independent country.
They mostly live in the Kurdistan 

7
00:00:24,721 --> 00:00:25,554
region,
which consists of much of southeast 

8
00:00:26,911 --> 00:00:27,744
Turkey,
northeastern Syria and northern Iraq in 

9
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:32,850
northwestern Iran,
as well as some other isolated areas and

10
00:00:32,851 --> 00:00:36,750
the former Soviet Union Kurdish as the 
majority language spoken in those areas,

11
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:40,410
there are approximately 30 million 
native speakers of Kurdish.

12
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:43,380
That includes around 14.5
million in Turkey,

13
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:45,450
5.6
million in Iraq,

14
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:48,480
6 million in Iran and around 2 million 
in Syria.

15
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:52,710
It also includes a Kurdish diaspora 
living outside of the Kurdistan region,

16
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:55,110
most notably in Germany,
like Persian.

17
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:55,973
Kurdish is a member of the indoor 
running and branch of the Indo European 

18
00:00:58,351 --> 00:00:59,184
language family,
but we're as Persian belongs to the 

19
00:01:00,661 --> 00:01:01,890
southwestern sub branch.

20
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,140
Kurdish belongs to the northwestern 
sub-branch.

21
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:06,120
Persian and Kurdish share many 
similarities,

22
00:01:06,121 --> 00:01:06,954
but they're not mutually intelligible.
The history of the Kurdish language is 

23
00:01:09,661 --> 00:01:12,330
the subject of much speculation for much
of its history.

24
00:01:12,331 --> 00:01:14,640
The Kurdish language was not a written 
language.

25
00:01:14,690 --> 00:01:15,523
Folk Tales and poetry were passed down 
orally from generation to generations 

26
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:19,403
with few exceptions.
The earliest written Kurdish texts come 

27
00:01:21,631 --> 00:01:22,464
from the 15th century and later there 
was one known poem from the seventh 

28
00:01:25,441 --> 00:01:27,570
century written in the garden.
He dialect,

29
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:29,183
but technically the granny dialect is 
actually a separate language from 

30
00:01:31,951 --> 00:01:32,940
Kurdish.
Okay.

31
00:01:32,941 --> 00:01:34,230
Wait,
this is getting confusing.

32
00:01:34,231 --> 00:01:36,930
Let me back up for a minute.
What is the Kurdish language?

33
00:01:36,931 --> 00:01:40,650
Is that one unified language that all 
Kurdish people can understand and speak?

34
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:41,850
No,
not really.

35
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:45,750
It's a collection of related dialects 
spread out across a continuum,

36
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:49,290
meaning that the language changes 
gradually over a geographic distance.

37
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:51,630
There are three main dialect groups of 
Kurdish.

38
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:54,110
Could Umangi Sorta Tony and pat.
Hello honey.

39
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:58,620
The most widely spoken is could Umangi 
with around 20 million native speakers.

40
00:01:58,800 --> 00:01:59,633
It is the major dialects spoken in 
Turkey as well as in Syria and some 

41
00:02:02,581 --> 00:02:03,414
parts of Iraq and parts of Iran.
The second most widely spoken is sorta 

42
00:02:07,081 --> 00:02:09,750
knee with six or 7 million native 
speakers,

43
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:10,613
mainly in Iraq and Iran.
The third most widely spoken is hello 

44
00:02:14,210 --> 00:02:15,043
ani,
which is spoken by about 3 million 

45
00:02:16,531 --> 00:02:20,310
people in some Kurdish areas in Iran and
one district in Iraqi Kurdistan.

46
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:25,020
These three dialects have a relatively 
low degree of mutual intelligibility,

47
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:28,830
so some people consider them to be 
distinct languages and not just dialects

48
00:02:28,831 --> 00:02:29,664
of one language.
The differences between these dialects 

49
00:02:31,411 --> 00:02:32,244
have been compounded by the fact that 
the Kurds are spread out across several 

50
00:02:34,711 --> 00:02:38,880
different countries and have no central 
media or a school system and haven't had

51
00:02:38,881 --> 00:02:39,714
much interaction with the other areas of
Kurdistan and there has also been some 

52
00:02:42,511 --> 00:02:45,360
influence from the official languages of
the countries where they live.

53
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:48,060
Could Umangi is written in a Latin 
alphabet like Turkish,

54
00:02:48,061 --> 00:02:48,894
while [inaudible] is written in a pair,
so Arabic script Atla one is written in 

55
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:52,973
either script on top of these main 
critic dialects or critic languages 

56
00:02:56,281 --> 00:02:57,114
depending on how you look at it.
There were also some other languages by 

57
00:02:59,561 --> 00:03:01,680
some Kurds,
a few million Kurds speaky.

58
00:03:01,681 --> 00:03:02,514
There's as that or go annie,
which form a separate sub branch of the 

59
00:03:05,381 --> 00:03:06,214
northwestern Iranian languages.
They're still quite closely related to 

60
00:03:09,221 --> 00:03:11,950
the Kurdish dialect and since they are 
spoken by Kurds,

61
00:03:11,951 --> 00:03:15,820
some people consider them to be Kurdish 
dialects for reasons related to cultural

62
00:03:15,821 --> 00:03:16,870
and ethnic identity.

63
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:18,773
Okay.

64
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:22,470
A big part of the story of Kurdish is 
the desire for linguistic freedom.

65
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:23,633
In Turkey.
The Kurdish language was heavily 

66
00:03:24,601 --> 00:03:25,434
suppressed.
For decades it was illegal to print 

67
00:03:27,091 --> 00:03:27,924
Kurdish language materials.
It was a prohibited language and 

68
00:03:30,351 --> 00:03:31,184
government institutions and schools and 
in public it was prohibited to speak it 

69
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:36,630
even though not everyone followed that 
rule in public.

70
00:03:36,631 --> 00:03:37,464
That was the rule.
These days those policies have been 

71
00:03:39,061 --> 00:03:39,894
relaxed,
but Kurds still wants certain freedoms 

72
00:03:41,281 --> 00:03:42,114
like the right to use the Kurdish 
language as the language of instruction 

73
00:03:44,311 --> 00:03:45,144
and regional schools.
There was a similar situation in Syria 

74
00:03:47,521 --> 00:03:50,640
and Iraq where the language was made 
illegal and heavily suppressed.

75
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:53,580
From what I understand,
Iran has not aggressively suppressed the

76
00:03:53,581 --> 00:03:55,380
Kurdish language,
but they have discouraged.

77
00:03:55,381 --> 00:03:58,380
It's use and promoted assimilation to 
the Persian language.

78
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:02,580
There was one country where Kurdish is 
an official language and that is Iraq.

79
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:03,533
And there was one area where Kurds have 
official autonomy and that's in Iraqi 

80
00:04:06,601 --> 00:04:07,434
Kurdistan,
which is run by the Kurdish regional 

81
00:04:08,791 --> 00:04:09,624
government.
They are Kurdish is the language of 

82
00:04:10,711 --> 00:04:11,544
instruction in schools and it's used in 
the media since there are speakers of 

83
00:04:15,541 --> 00:04:18,420
both Karangi and Serani dialects in 
Iraqi Kurdistan,

84
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:21,120
the government promotes both of them in 
schools and in the media.

85
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:24,360
There was now also another defacto 
autonomous Kurdish region,

86
00:04:24,361 --> 00:04:25,194
and that is in Syria and Kurdistan.
It is known as Brittle Java due to the 

87
00:04:27,991 --> 00:04:28,824
civil war.
The Syrian government is no longer in 

88
00:04:30,271 --> 00:04:31,104
control of the area and all restrictions
on the Kurdish language are now 

89
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:34,523
irrelevant.
Schools have introduced a new Kurdish 

90
00:04:36,091 --> 00:04:37,620
curriculum taught in Kurdish.

91
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:38,780
Okay.

92
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:39,613
The form of Kurdish used in Syria and 
Kurdistan is Kurmanji with Kurdish 

93
00:04:42,711 --> 00:04:47,030
autonomy and Kurdish language schools 
now existing in both Iraq and in Syria,

94
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:48,073
the curtis language might become 
stronger and more standardized in the 

95
00:04:50,331 --> 00:04:52,460
future.
So what exactly is Kurdish like?

96
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:53,383
Well,
that depends on what variety of Kurdish 

97
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:55,313
you're talking about.
So let's take a look at both could 

98
00:04:56,401 --> 00:04:58,400
Umangi and after that we'll look at 
sorta Annie.

99
00:04:59,120 --> 00:04:59,953
Here are a few interesting features of 
could Umangi could a bungee nouns are 

100
00:05:02,421 --> 00:05:05,000
all either masculine or feminine and 
there are four.

101
00:05:05,001 --> 00:05:07,970
Now in cases it is generally an Sov 
language.

102
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,160
They'll certain sentences are Svo put 
'em on.

103
00:05:10,161 --> 00:05:10,994
Ge has something called Ergot.
Tivity could Mangi has prepositions and 

104
00:05:13,821 --> 00:05:17,030
post positions and it also has something
called circle positions.

105
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:20,380
Let's have a look at the nouns and their
cases first could Manji has four.

106
00:05:20,381 --> 00:05:21,214
Now in cases nominative or bleak 
construct and Vocativ the case endings 

107
00:05:24,201 --> 00:05:26,810
are different depending on the gender 
and number of the knelt.

108
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:29,450
Here's an example with the word for men,

109
00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:32,840
middle,
middle of the row,

110
00:05:32,841 --> 00:05:33,900
v,
neuro,

111
00:05:33,901 --> 00:05:35,220
Vicky,
neuro,

112
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:38,660
neuro,
neuro,

113
00:05:38,670 --> 00:05:40,110
Vin,
and the roof.

114
00:05:40,130 --> 00:05:41,970
Name Neuro.
No.

115
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:46,410
Now here's an example of using the word 
for Woman Jin.

116
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:51,920
Ginny,
just you know Janeka Ginny Shin,

117
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:57,510
she none.
Shinon Junin [inaudible],

118
00:05:57,550 --> 00:05:58,383
no.

119
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:58,920
[inaudible].

120
00:05:58,920 --> 00:05:59,753
You may have noticed that the plural 
case endings are the same for both 

121
00:06:01,891 --> 00:06:05,370
genders because it could Umangi gender 
applies only to singular nouns,

122
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:06,750
not to plural nouns.
Okay,

123
00:06:06,751 --> 00:06:07,584
let's look at some examples,
sentences and could Umangi here we'll 

124
00:06:09,811 --> 00:06:11,820
see.
That could Umangi is generally sov.

125
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:14,300
This means I see the men,

126
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,273
middle one dabine him.
So if we translate this sentence 

127
00:06:18,771 --> 00:06:20,990
directly,
it's like Aye man.

128
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:21,883
C as equals I,
middle of equals man and is the oblique 

129
00:06:26,661 --> 00:06:27,494
case marker.
And also the plural marker and to be 

130
00:06:29,211 --> 00:06:33,590
name is c so you can see that the 
sentences Sov with the object coming in.

131
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:34,453
The middle positions I'm quoted in,
this means we are Kurdish or we are 

132
00:06:40,431 --> 00:06:41,264
Kurds.
If we tried to translate this sentence 

133
00:06:42,651 --> 00:06:45,920
directly,
it's like we Kurds are m equals,

134
00:06:45,921 --> 00:06:50,450
we couldn't equals curd in equals r.
That's the present tense Copula.

135
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,370
Again,
we can see that this is Sov.

136
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,620
The sentence doesn't actually have an 
object,

137
00:06:54,621 --> 00:06:55,454
but it has something called a compliment
which comes in the same position as the 

138
00:06:58,011 --> 00:06:58,844
object.
Now why does the Noun in the first 

139
00:07:00,051 --> 00:07:02,120
sentence happen?
Ending on it marked in yellow,

140
00:07:02,121 --> 00:07:02,954
but in the second sentence there isn't 
one and that's because nominative case 

141
00:07:05,481 --> 00:07:08,240
has no ending in either singular or 
plural and good manji.

142
00:07:08,450 --> 00:07:12,410
So we only know it's plural from the 
context and hear the context is that the

143
00:07:12,411 --> 00:07:14,330
subject is we,
so we know what's plural.

144
00:07:15,890 --> 00:07:17,900
Could Umangi exhibit something called 
Ergot?

145
00:07:17,901 --> 00:07:18,734
Tivity in ergots of languages,
the subject of a verb sometimes 

146
00:07:21,231 --> 00:07:23,540
functions as though it's the object of a
sentence.

147
00:07:23,690 --> 00:07:24,523
It could Umangi.
This happens when the verb is in one of 

148
00:07:26,031 --> 00:07:29,900
the past tenses.
The agent that is the doer of the action

149
00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:30,763
is in the oblique case,
like an object and the patient that is 

150
00:07:33,891 --> 00:07:36,560
the receiver of the action is in the 
nominative case,

151
00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:37,543
like a subject.
The verb then takes an ending to agree 

152
00:07:40,101 --> 00:07:40,934
with the patient.

153
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,280
Men,
oh deet.

154
00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:47,700
We would translate this as I saw him,
but it's more like by me.

155
00:07:47,701 --> 00:07:50,700
He was seen literally word for word.
It's me.

156
00:07:50,701 --> 00:07:51,534
He saw,
but the verb ending confirms that he is 

157
00:07:53,701 --> 00:07:57,690
actually the receiver of the action.
We as dictum,

158
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:02,370
this means he saw me or by him I was 
seeing word by word.

159
00:08:02,371 --> 00:08:03,780
It's him.
I saw,

160
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:04,673
but again,
the verb ending confirms that I as the 

161
00:08:06,691 --> 00:08:07,524
receiver of the action.
So here him as the ending for the first 

162
00:08:09,901 --> 00:08:12,660
person singular and that matches the 
patient of the sentence.

163
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,190
And that's I,
in this case,

164
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:17,220
I find ergotism it quite difficult to 
wrap my head around.

165
00:08:17,221 --> 00:08:19,620
It's not founded most Indo European 
languages.

166
00:08:19,621 --> 00:08:20,454
It's found in Kurdish,
it's found in Pashto and it's founded 

167
00:08:22,561 --> 00:08:24,600
some of the northern Indian languages.
Okay.

168
00:08:24,601 --> 00:08:26,700
If we want to make that last sentence 
negative,

169
00:08:26,730 --> 00:08:29,340
we simply add a negative prefix to the 
verb.

170
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:34,230
We as Ned Itam,
this means he didn't see me.

171
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,153
This is an example of how it could 
Umangi uses lots of different affixes 

172
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:42,990
could Umangi has prepositions which come
before noun phrases or pronouns and post

173
00:08:42,991 --> 00:08:45,570
positions which come after noun phrases 
or pronouns.

174
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:46,583
But it also has circle positions which 
wraparound the noun or pronoun or the 

175
00:08:49,801 --> 00:08:51,840
entire Noun phrase.
For example,

176
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:56,010
the bed.
This means in front of the bed,

177
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:56,973
Marlo Darek care.
This means there's a tree in front of 

178
00:09:00,601 --> 00:09:01,434
our house.
So if we try to read the sentence word 

179
00:09:03,031 --> 00:09:05,010
by word,
it's in front house,

180
00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:08,400
hour of tree,
there is now,

181
00:09:08,401 --> 00:09:10,890
I don't know if have is the part that I 
should have separated,

182
00:09:10,891 --> 00:09:11,724
but the point there is that in front of 
is split into two pieces and surrounds 

183
00:09:14,821 --> 00:09:17,790
the noun phrase.
Now let's look at some of those.

184
00:09:17,791 --> 00:09:18,624
Could Umangi sentences again and we'll 
compare them to some sorta nice 

185
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,280
sentences.
Again,

186
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:25,300
here are the sentences for ic,
the men in Guzman,

187
00:09:25,310 --> 00:09:29,470
g as literal one dabine him in.
So Danny.

188
00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:35,700
Now one difference that you can see is 
that the preposition is different in the

189
00:09:35,701 --> 00:09:36,534
two different languages.
So in could Umangi it's as that means I 

190
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:42,780
but in [inaudible] it's mean,
why does it mean?

191
00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:43,823
Well in [inaudible] men is the first 
person singular pronoun in the Oblique 

192
00:09:46,981 --> 00:09:47,814
case,
like an object Pronoun while as is the 

193
00:09:49,711 --> 00:09:50,544
nominative case.
But in sort I need the pronouns have no 

194
00:09:52,501 --> 00:09:53,334
cases.
So there's just one word and that word 

195
00:09:54,931 --> 00:09:58,200
has been another different word here is 
pll con,

196
00:09:58,230 --> 00:09:59,063
which is the word for man in I need,
that's different from the could Manji 

197
00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:02,663
word Middot van.
I think this is just an alternate word 

198
00:10:04,411 --> 00:10:05,244
for man in [inaudible] I think.
And so I need the word middle of means 

199
00:10:07,591 --> 00:10:09,000
man.
More as inhuman.

200
00:10:09,090 --> 00:10:11,520
Now both words for men here have the 
ending on,

201
00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:13,650
but it's actually different in both 
languages.

202
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,500
In could Manji it's the oblique case,
plural marker.

203
00:10:16,530 --> 00:10:19,110
But and so the need,
there are no cases so and so donny,

204
00:10:19,111 --> 00:10:19,944
it's just the general plural marker.
Now the sentences for we are Kurds in 

205
00:10:24,931 --> 00:10:28,960
could Umangi quoted then and in.
So Danny,

206
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,550
now here again,
we can see that the pronoun is different

207
00:10:32,551 --> 00:10:35,160
in the two languages.
It's the first person plural pronoun.

208
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:36,150
But in putting on,
gee,

209
00:10:36,151 --> 00:10:38,460
it's m and then saw danny,
it's Emma.

210
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:41,550
And in both languages we have the 
present tense Copula in.

211
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:44,230
The only difference here is the 
orthography and could on,

212
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,990
gee,
there's a space before the coffee love.

213
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:50,490
Now the sentences for,
I saw him in good Umangi men.

214
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:55,790
Oh deet and in Solani mean own Dick,
these sentences look quite similar.

215
00:10:56,310 --> 00:10:57,143
The sorani sentence has an extra m 
attached to the object of the sentence 

216
00:11:00,570 --> 00:11:04,930
that m is actually an ethics 
representing the subject in a soda.

217
00:11:04,931 --> 00:11:06,030
Any pass 10 sentence.

218
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:09,030
The subject is represented as an ethics 
before the verb.

219
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:11,940
Here the subject is also stated overtly 
as men,

220
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:14,960
but the sentence is possible without 
that first word in court.

221
00:11:14,961 --> 00:11:19,680
Manji it's not like that.
Now the sentences for he saw me in could

222
00:11:19,681 --> 00:11:24,681
Umangi we as dictum and in so Danny Oh 
money.

223
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:26,393
This example is similar to the last one.
We can see that the pronouns are 

224
00:11:29,161 --> 00:11:32,730
different and Sony,
because Sony has no case distinction and

225
00:11:32,731 --> 00:11:33,564
we can see that and put them on g.
The verb has an ending that the Sadhana 

226
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:38,940
verb doesn't have in the chronology 
sentence and objects.

227
00:11:38,941 --> 00:11:40,920
Suffix is attached to the end of the 
verb.

228
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:42,450
And so Dani,
on the other hand,

229
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:47,480
a subject affix is added before the verb
and here are the sentences for he didn't

230
00:11:47,941 --> 00:11:52,941
see me in [inaudible].
We as [inaudible] and in Daneen.

231
00:11:53,210 --> 00:11:54,043
Oh [inaudible].
Now this sentence is basically the same 

232
00:11:56,441 --> 00:11:58,150
as the last one except that it's 
negative.

233
00:11:58,210 --> 00:11:59,043
And we can see that put them on g and 
Sorta knee using negation in the same 

234
00:12:01,361 --> 00:12:02,194
way she wrote the sentences for,
there's a tree in front of our house in 

235
00:12:06,210 --> 00:12:07,043
could Umangi the bed,
Marlo Medda Dora care and in saw 

236
00:12:11,361 --> 00:12:13,810
[inaudible] that it kid Lebron 
Guatemala.

237
00:12:13,811 --> 00:12:14,644
Come on in the quarter Manji sentence.
We have a circle position that wraps 

238
00:12:17,681 --> 00:12:20,290
around the noun phrase,
but in the sorta and he's sentenced,

239
00:12:20,291 --> 00:12:21,124
there is a preposition that comes before
the noun phrase and the preposition 

240
00:12:23,871 --> 00:12:24,704
that's totally different.
And the noun phrase itself is also 

241
00:12:26,651 --> 00:12:27,484
somewhat different.
My love means house and could Umangi 

242
00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:33,910
while model means house and sorta need 
and may means hour increment g one.

243
00:12:33,911 --> 00:12:34,744
And so donny,
yet mun the egg after mal is an 

244
00:12:37,241 --> 00:12:38,074
indefinite article which doesn't exist 
in [inaudible] and the [inaudible] is a 

245
00:12:41,021 --> 00:12:43,630
connector which also isn't used in 
liquid laundry sentence.

246
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:47,810
So as you can see there are some 
significant differences between couldn't

247
00:12:47,811 --> 00:12:48,880
Manji and sorta knee.

248
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:50,990
So which variety of Curtis should you 
learn?

249
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:51,943
Well if you're planning on spending some
time in the Kurdistan region than it 

250
00:12:54,021 --> 00:12:57,200
would make sense to learn the variety of
the place where you planned to spend the

251
00:12:57,201 --> 00:12:58,034
most time and in the future you could 
always learn to adapt and speak a 

252
00:13:00,411 --> 00:13:01,244
different dialect.
By extension is Kurdish at difficult 

253
00:13:03,261 --> 00:13:04,340
language to learn?
Well,

254
00:13:04,341 --> 00:13:07,880
there are some things like urgh activity
that are probably challenging for people

255
00:13:07,881 --> 00:13:08,714
who have never encountered them before,
but probably some of the most 

256
00:13:11,121 --> 00:13:11,954
challenging things will be the dialectal
variation in the language and the lack 

257
00:13:14,991 --> 00:13:19,190
of a single standard language as well as
a general lack of learning materials.

258
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:21,050
On the other hand,
from what I understand,

259
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:21,913
if you have a previous knowledge of 
Persian that will help you a great deal 

260
00:13:24,291 --> 00:13:25,124
in learning Kurdish and critics,
people are also all very welcoming and 

261
00:13:28,131 --> 00:13:28,964
friendly and very enthusiastic about 
helping you to learn their language and 

262
00:13:31,671 --> 00:13:33,860
that kind of support is always very 
encouraging.

263
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:34,933
Okay.
The question of the day for Curtis 

264
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:37,013
speakers,
how easy is it for you to communicate 

265
00:13:38,721 --> 00:13:40,880
with speakers of other varieties of 
Kurdish?

266
00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:43,700
And do you consider them all dialects of
a single language,

267
00:13:43,701 --> 00:13:45,650
or do you consider them distinct 
languages?

268
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:46,753
And for people who've studied Kurdish,
what did you find challenging about the 

269
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:49,994
language and in general,
what was your experience with the 

270
00:13:51,861 --> 00:13:52,694
language?
We'd like to hear about it in the 

271
00:13:53,451 --> 00:13:56,270
comments down below.
Definitely be sure to checkout lane,

272
00:13:56,271 --> 00:13:57,950
focus on twitter,

273
00:13:57,951 --> 00:13:59,600
and on instagram.
And again,

274
00:13:59,601 --> 00:14:00,434
I'd like to say thanks to all of my 
patrion supporters for continuing to 

275
00:14:02,871 --> 00:14:06,190
make Lang focus possible.
Thank you for watching and have a nice,

276
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:07,273
hey.
