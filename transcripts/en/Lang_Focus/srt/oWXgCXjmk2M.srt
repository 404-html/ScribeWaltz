00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:03,790
Hey look,
I found this book called Kinky Japanese.

2
00:00:04,330 --> 00:00:06,670
I guess this is all Hentai stuff or 
something.

3
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:14,333
Hey guys,
today I'm going to answer a question 

4
00:00:15,781 --> 00:00:16,614
that I wanted to ask them that a lot of 
people who are beginners at Japanese 

5
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:21,293
often asking it's should I learn a 
Japanese dialect from the beginning or 

6
00:00:25,291 --> 00:00:26,124
should I just focus on the standard 
language in my answer to that is 

7
00:00:29,611 --> 00:00:32,760
basically you should focus on the 
standard language.

8
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:34,103
Before I came to Japan,
I was planning to come to the kinky 

9
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:39,510
region or the Kansai region.
This is also known,

10
00:00:39,550 --> 00:00:42,690
that's the area around Osaka and Kyoto 
and Kobe.

11
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,230
I was planning to come to this region 
already.

12
00:00:46,231 --> 00:00:49,110
So I knew that I would be encountering 
the local dialect.

13
00:00:49,111 --> 00:00:49,944
So I bought this book because I wanted 
to know some of the dialect beforehand 

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:54,833
and then I got here and I'll tell you my
experience and what happened once I got 

15
00:00:57,901 --> 00:00:59,370
here.
Basically,

16
00:00:59,371 --> 00:01:02,070
I think you should focus on the standard
language,

17
00:01:02,090 --> 00:01:02,923
um,
because because the dialects are just 

18
00:01:05,641 --> 00:01:09,510
not really a big deal in Japan anymore 
with the Japanese language,

19
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:11,430
they were like 100 years ago,
you know,

20
00:01:11,431 --> 00:01:12,264
the dialects were quite different than 
people would have to try really hard to 

21
00:01:15,571 --> 00:01:17,640
communicate with speakers from other 
dialects.

22
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:18,473
But now basically everyone speaks 
standard Japanese with some components 

23
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:25,950
of the dialect,
but they've become much more standard in

24
00:01:25,951 --> 00:01:27,140
recent generations,
you know,

25
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:29,080
through education and through,
uh,

26
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:30,173
the media,
the national media that's based in 

27
00:01:31,291 --> 00:01:32,124
Tokyo.
People are learning the standard 

28
00:01:33,541 --> 00:01:35,730
language and that's becoming the model 
that they,

29
00:01:35,890 --> 00:01:36,723
they copy.
So the exceptions are when you meet 

30
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:40,133
elderly people,
they'll often speak like a heavier 

31
00:01:41,701 --> 00:01:44,190
dialect and they might say a lot of 
dialect words.

32
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:46,890
When a younger person would use the 
standard words,

33
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:48,133
uh,
it's also true sometimes in working 

34
00:01:50,941 --> 00:01:51,774
class neighborhoods or with less 
educated people and also deeper in the 

35
00:01:55,861 --> 00:01:56,694
countryside,
you will hear more of the dialect as 

36
00:01:58,651 --> 00:01:59,484
well.
But basically with the younger 

37
00:02:00,301 --> 00:02:02,730
generations that mainstream Japanese 
people,

38
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:07,770
they speak mostly the standard language 
with some bits of the dialect mixed in.

39
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:10,440
So it's not really essential that you 
learn those bits,

40
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,660
uh,
it's more essential that you learned the

41
00:02:12,661 --> 00:02:13,494
foundation of Japanese have standard 
Japanese and then once you're here you 

42
00:02:17,851 --> 00:02:18,684
will just,
you'll pick up some of the elements of 

43
00:02:20,551 --> 00:02:23,940
the dialect from your environment and 
through your casual interactions.

44
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:26,130
So it's not really critical that you 
study it.

45
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,130
You don't have to avoid the dialect,
like,

46
00:02:29,131 --> 00:02:32,010
I bought this book,
but I use this just basically,

47
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,153
uh,
just as a supplement just for fun just 

48
00:02:34,681 --> 00:02:36,930
to,
just to get familiar with the bit of the

49
00:02:36,931 --> 00:02:38,670
dialect before I came here.
And it was good.

50
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,920
It was a good idea because once I got 
here,

51
00:02:40,921 --> 00:02:43,320
I understood those dialect elements when
I heard them.

52
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:48,330
But that's just as an extra supplement 
for fun and for familiarization,

53
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:50,910
uh,
I would focus on the standard language.

54
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,710
So the direction,
not a big deal.

55
00:02:52,711 --> 00:02:56,130
That's one thing.
A second reason is that people will just

56
00:02:56,131 --> 00:02:56,964
tend to speak to you and standard 
Japanese anyway because you're a 400 

57
00:02:59,621 --> 00:03:00,454
learning Japanese.
So they will simplify and standardize 

58
00:03:03,311 --> 00:03:04,144
their language to try to help you.
So you won't hear the dialect being 

59
00:03:07,181 --> 00:03:09,670
spoken to you directly,
all that often,

60
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:10,563
unless it's like an elderly person or 
maybe someone in the countryside or 

61
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:13,984
whatever,
but most people will speak to you in 

62
00:03:16,031 --> 00:03:20,320
standard language and wherever you go,
if you speak the standard language,

63
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:24,010
they'll be able to speak it back to you,
unless it's one of those types of people

64
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:26,470
I mentioned they might not be able to 
with that said,

65
00:03:26,471 --> 00:03:27,304
it's a good idea to learn some of the 
dialect before you come here and to 

66
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:34,360
familiarize yourself with it just 
passively.

67
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:39,630
You don't have to practice producing the
dialects or I'm getting fluent and using

68
00:03:40,541 --> 00:03:42,610
the dialect.
You don't have to do that.

69
00:03:42,611 --> 00:03:43,444
You just a book like this,
which just basically introduces some of 

70
00:03:46,721 --> 00:03:50,590
the words and shows them in context is 
good just just for passive learning.

71
00:03:50,591 --> 00:03:51,424
So you'll know it when you hear it.
And then over time as you live in that 

72
00:03:54,161 --> 00:03:54,994
location,
you will incorporate some of those 

73
00:03:57,401 --> 00:04:01,690
elements of the dialect into your 
natural speech in the right situations.

74
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:02,760
Right?
Uh,

75
00:04:02,770 --> 00:04:03,603
so just just do that.
Focus on the standard language and have 

76
00:04:07,061 --> 00:04:07,894
some fun learning a bit of the dialect 
and over time it will become part of 

77
00:04:10,931 --> 00:04:13,180
your Japanese.
So that's my advice.

78
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,560
I hope that's helpful.
Alright,

79
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:15,580
talk to you later.
Bye.
