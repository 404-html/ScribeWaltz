Hello everyone,
welcome to the Lange Focus Channel and 

2
00:00:03,091 --> 00:00:06,570
my name is Paul.
What languages does the Pope speak?

3
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:10,380
I want to talk about polyglot pope's.
When you think of the pope,

4
00:00:10,381 --> 00:00:13,560
you might think of a very holy person,
a religious person,

5
00:00:13,561 --> 00:00:16,620
someone who sits around praying all day 
or something like that,

6
00:00:16,621 --> 00:00:17,454
but think about it.
To be the leader of a huge organization 

7
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:22,710
like the Catholic Church,
do you have to be a very success minded,

8
00:00:22,711 --> 00:00:23,544
driven then accomplished individually,
so let's look at a few recent folks and 

9
00:00:26,821 --> 00:00:29,160
see where they rate on the polyglot 
scale.

10
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:31,380
First,
let's talk about the current pope.

11
00:00:31,381 --> 00:00:34,530
Pope Francis,
who became the pope in 2013.

12
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:35,513
He is originally from Argentina and he 
speaks Spanish fluently as his native 

13
00:00:39,121 --> 00:00:41,700
language.
He also speaks Italian fluently.

14
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:42,713
He learned Italian as a kid when he was 
in Argentina from his father and his 

15
00:00:46,261 --> 00:00:47,094
grandparents who were Italian immigrants
and early on when he became the pope at 

16
00:00:50,281 --> 00:00:51,114
the beginning,
he would only speak Italian in public 

17
00:00:52,891 --> 00:00:55,020
for the media or in front of audiences.

18
00:00:55,290 --> 00:00:56,123
Italian is the Lingua Franca of the 
Vatican and it's the most commonly 

19
00:00:58,711 --> 00:01:03,330
spoken language in the Vatican,
and also he is the arch bishop of Rome,

20
00:01:03,331 --> 00:01:05,370
so it makes sense that he would speak 
Italian,

21
00:01:05,371 --> 00:01:06,204
the language of his own locality.
I've also heard reports from Brazilian 

22
00:01:09,811 --> 00:01:12,330
people that when Pope Francis visited 
Brazil,

23
00:01:12,331 --> 00:01:16,680
he spoke fluently in Portuguese,
although with a heavy Argentinian accent

24
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:19,260
and apparently the pope speaks also 
German and French,

25
00:01:19,261 --> 00:01:21,750
but he is getting rusty due to a lack of
use.

26
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:22,733
Pope Francis also admits that he's had 
quite a hard time learning English in 

27
00:01:25,891 --> 00:01:30,060
large part due to English phonology,
which he finds hard during a three month

28
00:01:30,061 --> 00:01:32,250
stay in Ireland.
When he tried to learn English,

29
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:33,143
he had some trouble.
Although I must say I can't blame him 

30
00:01:34,861 --> 00:01:38,070
for being confused by the Irish people.
Funny Pronunciation.

31
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:39,210
Sorry.
Irish people.

32
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:42,480
Just kidding.
After being the pope for a little over a

33
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:44,580
year,
Pope Francis spoke English in public for

34
00:01:44,581 --> 00:01:49,581
the first time in Seoul,
Korea to say yes.

35
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:55,380
So

36
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:59,190
clearly Pope Francis is working on his 
English and he's improving it to be able

37
00:01:59,191 --> 00:02:00,990
to do his duties better around the 
world.

38
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:02,123
Of course,
he also knows Latin which is used for 

39
00:02:03,571 --> 00:02:07,680
ceremonial purposes and for official 
documents in the Vatican and part of his

40
00:02:07,681 --> 00:02:10,620
studies was also filling in biblical 
Hebrew and biblical Greek,

41
00:02:10,621 --> 00:02:14,340
which are necessary for Bible study.
So Pope Francis speaks Spanish,

42
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:15,480
Italian,
Portuguese,

43
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:17,010
some German,
some French,

44
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:20,340
some English,
and three literary languages for a total

45
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:24,720
polyglot score of six out of 10.
That's pretty darn good by the way,

46
00:02:24,721 --> 00:02:25,554
but he's up against some stiff 
competition so I can't give him 10 out 

47
00:02:28,021 --> 00:02:28,854
of 10.
Next is pope benedict the 16th who was 

48
00:02:31,081 --> 00:02:35,550
the pope from 2005 until 2013 when he 
resigned.

49
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:38,460
He is known for being more of a 
legitimate polyglot.

50
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:41,340
Then Pope Francis,
his native language is German,

51
00:02:41,341 --> 00:02:44,100
but he is also known to fluently speak 
Italian,

52
00:02:44,101 --> 00:02:46,260
French,
English and Spanish.

53
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:48,990
I've also read reports that he speaks 
Portuguese,

54
00:02:48,991 --> 00:02:49,824
but not totally fluently,
but he's very good at Latin and used 

55
00:02:52,981 --> 00:02:55,620
Latin more than Pope Francis currently 
does as pope,

56
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:59,200
and of course he can also read biblical 
Hebrew and biblical Greek,

57
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:01,030
but again,
they're not spoken languages.

58
00:03:01,031 --> 00:03:03,010
Those are just classical written 
languages.

59
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:07,300
Pope Benedict made waves in 2013 when he
resigned as the pope,

60
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:08,163
which is almost completely unheard of,
and he made waves partly because his 

61
00:03:11,801 --> 00:03:12,634
announcement was in Latin.
The reporter who broke the story to the 

62
00:03:15,311 --> 00:03:16,144
world ended up being the only reporter 
in the Vatican press office who could 

63
00:03:19,391 --> 00:03:20,224
understand the original report in Latin.
So let's recap for a pope benedict the 

64
00:03:23,771 --> 00:03:25,540
16th.
He speaks German,

65
00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:27,010
Italian,
Spanish,

66
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,660
French,
and English fluently.

67
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:29,763
He also speaks some Portuguese and he 
speaks lesson he knows to literary 

68
00:03:33,191 --> 00:03:34,024
languages,
Greek and Biblical Hebrew for right 

69
00:03:35,621 --> 00:03:36,454
total polyglot score of seven out of 10,
but the king of polyglot pope's is 

70
00:03:40,631 --> 00:03:41,464
without a doubt.

71
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:46,470
Pope John Paul the second who was the 
pope from 1978 until his death in 2005.

72
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:50,110
Pope John Paul the second was originally
from Poland.

73
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:53,770
So his native language was Polish,
but he was also fluent in Italian,

74
00:03:53,771 --> 00:03:55,360
Spanish,
Portuguese,

75
00:03:55,390 --> 00:03:58,180
French and English as well as Latin.
Of course,

76
00:03:58,210 --> 00:03:59,043
Pope John Paul the second is also known 
for having a good working knowledge of 

77
00:04:01,751 --> 00:04:02,584
some other languages,
at least enough to speak publicly in 

78
00:04:04,811 --> 00:04:09,220
those languages with some preparation.
Those languages include Slovak,

79
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:10,210
Russian,
Ukrainian,

80
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,530
Japanese,
Tagalog,

81
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:14,620
among many others.
At the end of one Easter mass,

82
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:19,090
he once gave an Easter greeting in 57 
different languages.

83
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,690
Maybe he loved languages so much because
he was also an avid traveler.

84
00:04:22,691 --> 00:04:23,524
He visited 129 different countries,
which is more than any other point in 

85
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:28,510
history.
So to recap,

86
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:31,570
Pope John Paul the second was fluent in 
Polish,

87
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,740
Italian,
Spanish,

88
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:33,970
Portuguese,
French,

89
00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:34,923
English and German and Latin.
Auntie do a whole bunch of other 

90
00:04:37,751 --> 00:04:40,510
languages better than most language 
dabblers out there.

91
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:43,490
So he gets a total polyglot score of 10

92
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,450
out of 10,

93
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:48,520
whether you're a Catholic or not.
Pope John Paul,

94
00:04:48,521 --> 00:04:51,970
the second was clearly uninspiring,
polyglot and his language lovers.

95
00:04:51,971 --> 00:04:55,540
We can look up to and admire that aspect
of his life and his work.

96
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,430
Thank you for watching the length.
Focus.

97
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:58,263
Gentle.
Have a good night.
