Hello everyone.
Lang focus channel or your up.

3
00:00:08,350 --> 00:00:10,810
I want to talk about something called 
code switching.

4
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:12,280
Gang goal cutie pie article.
Though

5
00:00:15,830 --> 00:00:18,830
some people are monolingual and speak 
just one language.

6
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:19,723
Other people are bilingual or 
multilingual and speak more than one 

7
00:00:22,371 --> 00:00:23,204
language.
Bilingual or multilingual people 

8
00:00:24,801 --> 00:00:28,400
sometimes switch back and forth between 
two or more different languages.

9
00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:32,600
This is called code switching.
One situation in which code switching is

10
00:00:32,601 --> 00:00:35,180
common is within immigrant families.
For example,

11
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:39,260
let's imagine a Russian family moves 
from Russia to the United States and the

12
00:00:39,261 --> 00:00:42,020
children grow up speaking Russian as 
their native language,

13
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:44,390
but they learned English outside of the 
home.

14
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:47,210
When the children in that family speak 
to their siblings,

15
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:49,700
they might code switch between Russian 
and English.

16
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:50,953
Another situation in which code 
switching is common is in certain 

17
00:00:53,571 --> 00:00:54,404
countries where a native language is 
spoken alongside a former colonial 

18
00:00:57,501 --> 00:00:58,334
language.
One example that comes to mind is in 

19
00:00:59,841 --> 00:01:00,674
India where Hindi English code switching
is Coleman and another example is in 

20
00:01:04,011 --> 00:01:06,830
Philippines where Tagalog English code 
switching is Coleman.

21
00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:09,590
You may have seen my earlier video on 
die glossier,

22
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:10,453
which means switching between two 
different languages or two different 

23
00:01:12,921 --> 00:01:15,590
forms of a language in different 
situations.

24
00:01:15,650 --> 00:01:18,440
For example,
formal versus informal situations.

25
00:01:18,530 --> 00:01:19,363
Code switching is different in that 
people switch languages in a single 

26
00:01:22,011 --> 00:01:26,180
situation within a single conversation 
and sometimes within a single sentence.

27
00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:27,283
Code switching is largely unpredictable 
and speakers often impulsively switch 

28
00:01:30,891 --> 00:01:31,724
languages without any conscious choice 
in code switching one language is the 

29
00:01:35,271 --> 00:01:36,104
dominant language.
Normally the native language of the 

30
00:01:37,821 --> 00:01:38,654
group,
this is sometimes called the Matrix 

31
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:43,610
language and the additional language is 
called the embedded language.

32
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:45,133
The Matrix language lays out the basis 
for the communication and then 

33
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:51,770
utterances from the additional language 
are embedded into the matrix language.

34
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:52,783
There were various reasons that people 
might switch from their matrix language 

35
00:01:55,311 --> 00:01:57,320
to an embedded language.
Number one,

36
00:01:57,350 --> 00:01:58,183
directive function.
People switch languages to either 

37
00:02:00,351 --> 00:02:03,260
include or exclude other people from the
conversation.

38
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:04,273
Maybe you want to tell secrets,
so you switched to a language that the 

39
00:02:06,651 --> 00:02:09,230
people around you don't understand or 
maybe the opposite.

40
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:10,093
Maybe you want to end a private 
conversation and reengage with the 

41
00:02:12,681 --> 00:02:13,514
people around you,
so you switched to a language that they 

42
00:02:14,901 --> 00:02:16,280
do understand.
Number two,

43
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:17,143
expressive function.
People include the embedded language in 

44
00:02:19,401 --> 00:02:21,560
order to express some part of their 
identity.

45
00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:22,723
For example,
they want to show their connection to a 

46
00:02:24,051 --> 00:02:24,884
certain country or culture,
and in some cases it might be an 

47
00:02:27,201 --> 00:02:30,920
expression of status through association
with the prestigious outgroup.

48
00:02:31,070 --> 00:02:35,120
Number three referential function.
Someone who is unable to express an idea

49
00:02:35,121 --> 00:02:35,954
easily in one language switches to the 
other language in order to express it 

50
00:02:38,781 --> 00:02:39,614
more easily.
This seems to be very common among 

51
00:02:41,181 --> 00:02:43,010
bilingual children in immigrant 
families.

52
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:44,810
Number four,
phatic function.

53
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:49,010
Sometimes a speaker switches languages 
or repeat something in both languages in

54
00:02:49,011 --> 00:02:50,030
order to emphasize it.

55
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:52,220
Number five,
metal linguistic function.

56
00:02:52,490 --> 00:02:56,360
This is reporting something in the other
language or commenting on something said

57
00:02:56,361 --> 00:02:57,980
in the other language.
For example,

58
00:02:57,981 --> 00:02:58,814
you're speaking in Japanese,
but then you quote a lyric from an 

59
00:03:00,821 --> 00:03:02,980
English language song without 
translating it.

60
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:05,080
Maybe you'll say something in the 
embedded language,

61
00:03:05,081 --> 00:03:08,770
but then you explain it or add further 
commentary in the Matrix language.

62
00:03:09,070 --> 00:03:09,903
Number six poetic function.
The speaker says certain words or mixed 

63
00:03:12,581 --> 00:03:13,414
jokes in the embedded language for 
amusement or for some kind of artistic 

64
00:03:16,061 --> 00:03:16,894
purpose.
Code switching takes a few different 

65
00:03:18,461 --> 00:03:20,230
forms.
Here are some of the main ones.

66
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:21,213
Number one inter sentential switching in
which the language switches for entire 

67
00:03:24,821 --> 00:03:26,830
sentences or clauses.
For example,

68
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,140
a bilingual Spanish English speaker 
says,

69
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:31,000
sometimes I'll start a sentence in 
English.

70
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:31,601
He tell him,
you know,

71
00:03:31,601 --> 00:03:33,070
and a spaniel.
Number two,

72
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:33,963
interest sentential switching in which 
the speaker switches languages within 

73
00:03:36,731 --> 00:03:37,990
the clause or sentence boundaries.

74
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:41,860
Here's an example from a bilingual 
English Portuguese speakers speech.

75
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:44,430
I don't know,
may you Luca [inaudible] window.

76
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:47,080
This means I don't know my place in this
world.

77
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:50,380
Number three extra sentential or tag 
switching.

78
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:54,820
A tag from one language is inserted into
an utterance in another language.

79
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:56,013
For example,
a bilingual English Japanese speaker 

80
00:03:57,701 --> 00:04:00,850
might say it's a good movie.
They show meaning it's a good movie,

81
00:04:00,851 --> 00:04:01,684
right?
Let's look at a couple of cases of code 

82
00:04:04,061 --> 00:04:06,460
switching.
The first one is from the Indian movie,

83
00:04:06,461 --> 00:04:07,294
the three idiots.
The Matrix language is Hindi and the 

84
00:04:09,461 --> 00:04:12,790
embedded language is English.
The background to this scene is that the

85
00:04:12,791 --> 00:04:16,810
director of a university is welcoming 
the incoming freshmen students.

86
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:21,860
Hi John Lott.

87
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:30,603
Now let's take a look at the sentence we
just heard the sentence means don't 

88
00:04:33,461 --> 00:04:36,310
forget,
I see he receives 400,000

89
00:04:36,311 --> 00:04:40,810
applications a year and of those only 
200 are selected you.

90
00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:45,040
The first clause of this sentence,
don't forget it's an English.

91
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:46,383
This is interesting potential code 
switching because the switching occurs 

92
00:04:48,791 --> 00:04:49,624
at the clause boundary.
This is probably done to draw attention 

93
00:04:52,181 --> 00:04:54,460
to the phrase which is the phatic 
function.

94
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:55,593
Applications is also an English 
switching within the clause or sentence 

95
00:04:58,481 --> 00:04:59,314
boundaries.
I suspect that this words in English 

96
00:05:00,851 --> 00:05:01,684
because it's referring to college 
applications and words related to 

97
00:05:04,571 --> 00:05:05,404
academic affairs are probably said very 
frequently in English select is also an 

98
00:05:09,131 --> 00:05:09,964
English.
This is interest sentential switching 

99
00:05:11,261 --> 00:05:12,094
again,
the speaker or the script writers 

100
00:05:13,661 --> 00:05:14,494
probably chose to say this word in 
English in order to emphasize the 

101
00:05:16,811 --> 00:05:17,644
importance of this action of selecting 
the freshmen students and of course you 

102
00:05:21,361 --> 00:05:22,194
as an English.

103
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:25,560
This is interesting essential because it
occurs at the clause boundary.

104
00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:26,603
This word was probably set apart and set
an English in order to emphasize the 

105
00:05:29,791 --> 00:05:32,430
selection of these particular students.
So again,

106
00:05:32,431 --> 00:05:36,480
that's the phatic function in general.
The speaker in this scene might be using

107
00:05:36,481 --> 00:05:39,000
English because he's the director of a 
university,

108
00:05:39,030 --> 00:05:42,000
and English is seen as an integral part 
of academic life.

109
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:45,450
Let's look at a second example.
This time from the Filipino movie,

110
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,890
My baby love.
Now,

111
00:05:46,891 --> 00:05:50,550
the background to the scene is that the 
young woman's father and the young man's

112
00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:51,443
aunts have started dating each other.
Let's take a look at the whole scene 

113
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:54,624
first.

114
00:05:55,690 --> 00:05:56,740
That long

115
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:02,400
mopping,
personal libre,

116
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:07,500
excusing [inaudible] mommy go.
We'll be in [inaudible].

117
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:17,520
So I'm people in it.
Well,

118
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:23,000
my smug under,
I'm Mamiko spill my smog under.

119
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:30,900
I want me to go find him.
And besides,

120
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:34,300
I always didn't want to [inaudible] if 
that's what you wanted to hear,

121
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:36,810
the good,
at least we have leading something.

122
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:39,160
I have to go now by now.
I go by

123
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:42,263
now.
Let's look at a few parts of that scene 

124
00:06:43,021 --> 00:06:44,190
again and break them down.

125
00:06:46,410 --> 00:06:51,410
So [inaudible] that month course not 
mopping personal and elaborate me.

126
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:57,130
[inaudible] Mommy Mamiko

127
00:06:58,150 --> 00:06:58,983
can we see interest sentential switching
with English phrases embedded into a 

128
00:07:02,041 --> 00:07:02,874
tagalog sentence in her reply,
I think the woman's switches to English 

129
00:07:05,941 --> 00:07:06,774
to emphasize certain points.
The main message of a reply that her 

130
00:07:09,361 --> 00:07:13,410
mother is beautiful isn't Tagalog,
but this is an emotional conversation.

131
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:16,350
And the English phrases draw attention 
to how she's feeling.

132
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:21,680
So I don't even give,
if it'll be in suicide,

133
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:26,980
we're going down one week or so.
I'm people in it.

134
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:30,690
Well,
my smog and dot Emami go

135
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:35,300
here.
We see extra sentential switching or tag

136
00:07:35,301 --> 00:07:38,230
switching the interjection,
well as an English,

137
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:39,490
but the rest of the sentences.
