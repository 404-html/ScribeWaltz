1
00:00:06,860 --> 00:00:07,693
Good day everyone.
This is Paul and you are watching the 

2
00:00:09,831 --> 00:00:10,664
langue focus Janel and today we're going
to talk about that some interesting 

3
00:00:13,551 --> 00:00:15,620
stuff.
We're going to talk about the difference

4
00:00:15,621 --> 00:00:18,830
between a language and a dialect.
Now,

5
00:00:18,831 --> 00:00:22,220
what is the difference all over the 
world there are people who speak closely

6
00:00:22,221 --> 00:00:23,054
related forms of communication.
Sometimes they are called different 

7
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:27,313
languages.
Sometimes they are called dialects of 

8
00:00:28,761 --> 00:00:31,580
one language,
so how do we decide which one they are?

9
00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:32,443
Sometimes there's some disagreement 
about which one a particular form of 

10
00:00:35,031 --> 00:00:35,864
communication is.
Is it a dialect or is it a separate 

11
00:00:37,611 --> 00:00:40,970
language?
The dialect really means in a variety of

12
00:00:40,971 --> 00:00:41,804
speech that differs somewhat from 
another variety of speech of that same 

13
00:00:45,981 --> 00:00:49,010
language.
It could differ in grammar,

14
00:00:49,011 --> 00:00:51,410
it could differ in phonology or 
pronunciation.

15
00:00:51,411 --> 00:00:53,750
It could.
Different vocabulary could different.

16
00:00:53,751 --> 00:00:54,584
All of those may be,
sometimes those dialects are based in 

17
00:00:57,501 --> 00:00:58,640
different regions.

18
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,440
They are regional varieties of a 
language.

19
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:03,170
Sometimes they are ethnic varieties of a
language.

20
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:06,560
For example,
maybe there are two ethnic groups living

21
00:01:06,561 --> 00:01:07,394
in a city,
but historically they've lived separate 

22
00:01:09,111 --> 00:01:12,920
and not really interacted with each 
other because of racism or whatever.

23
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:16,340
And they've developed a separate dialect
because of that separation.

24
00:01:16,370 --> 00:01:19,490
So they're almost living in two worlds 
within the same city,

25
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:22,160
that kind of thing.
So it's almost like a different regional

26
00:01:22,161 --> 00:01:25,520
dialect inside your your on talent if 
you know what I'm in now,

27
00:01:25,521 --> 00:01:29,390
within every language there is some 
degree of variety,

28
00:01:29,391 --> 00:01:30,224
some degree of difference.
There are some different spoken 

29
00:01:32,571 --> 00:01:36,710
varieties of every language.
So how do we decide if it's close enough

30
00:01:36,711 --> 00:01:39,560
to the language to be considered a 
dialect and when is it not?

31
00:01:39,890 --> 00:01:40,723
Well,
one of the men criteria that is most 

32
00:01:42,561 --> 00:01:43,394
often used is mutual intelligibility.
That means the speakers of those two 

33
00:01:47,271 --> 00:01:48,104
different varieties of the language can 
understand each other fully or almost 

34
00:01:52,251 --> 00:01:53,450
fully understand each other.

35
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:56,240
We would say they're mutually 
intelligible in that case.

36
00:01:56,540 --> 00:02:00,170
So according to this definition,
simply if you can understand each other,

37
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:03,170
you can understand them and you can make
yourself understood to them,

38
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:04,183
then you are speaking the same language.
And if even if there's some degree of 

39
00:02:07,281 --> 00:02:10,790
difference in grammar or phonology or 
vocabulary,

40
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:14,660
those are just dialectal differences 
because you can understand each other.

41
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:15,613
The languages are close enough that they
are considered the same language 

42
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:19,543
according to that definition.
Now the problem with this definition is 

43
00:02:22,221 --> 00:02:23,054
that sometimes speakers of what is 
considered to be one language often 

44
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:28,430
can't understand each other.
Like for example,

45
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:32,540
often I can't understand people who 
speak a Scottish dialect of English.

46
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:37,213
When I say it to somebody else,
I'll tell you about you finally got the 

47
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:45,653
boys.

48
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:49,593
Often,
I can't understand people who speak a 

49
00:02:51,221 --> 00:02:55,120
Scottish dialect of English or sometimes
an Australian dialect of English.

50
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:57,850
If they come from like the deep 
countryside of Australia,

51
00:02:57,970 --> 00:02:58,803
sometimes I can't them.
And this is especially true if I 

52
00:03:01,661 --> 00:03:04,600
overhear two of those people speaking 
together,

53
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:06,970
I hear them speaking with each other and
not directly to me.

54
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:09,670
Then they'll speak in their full on 
different accent,

55
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:11,980
different dialect,
and sometimes I can't understand.

56
00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:16,240
So are we speaking a different language 
because it's not mutually intelligible.

57
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:19,390
So that's kind of the difficult point of
this definition.

58
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:21,910
Sometimes I can't understand other 
speakers of English,

59
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:24,460
but I think it's the same language.
And so do they.

60
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:28,000
So what's going on there?
So that brings me to another criteria of

61
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,073
what would make to spoken varieties just
to dialects of one language and that is 

62
00:03:32,621 --> 00:03:33,454
this.
Both of those varieties used the same 

63
00:03:35,141 --> 00:03:37,810
written standard variety of language.

64
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:40,450
These are the same written standard,
the same written language.

65
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:41,613
Even though the spoken language means 
differ somewhat so that would explain 

66
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:45,724
why I speak English and a Scottish 
person speaks English even if there may 

67
00:03:48,701 --> 00:03:51,910
be some trouble communicating.
We both use the same written language.

68
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:52,893
You both rate in the same way.
We read the same books and then when we 

69
00:03:55,841 --> 00:04:00,100
speak to each other we can adapt our 
speech to make it a little bit more like

70
00:04:00,101 --> 00:04:00,934
the written standard.
Now that's why we can communicate even 

71
00:04:03,461 --> 00:04:04,294
though I can't really understand their 
variety of English when they speak the 

72
00:04:07,691 --> 00:04:09,460
pure form,
when they speak it with each other,

73
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:10,473
I don't,
I don't really know what they're saying 

74
00:04:11,081 --> 00:04:11,914
a lot of the time,
but when they speak to me they kind of 

75
00:04:13,331 --> 00:04:15,610
use a book English a little bit literary
English.

76
00:04:15,611 --> 00:04:19,780
They use more of the written standard 
and mix it in with their natural dialect

77
00:04:19,781 --> 00:04:21,220
to make it understandable to me.

78
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:22,083
And I think I do the same unconsciously.
So that's what makes us speakers of the 

79
00:04:25,661 --> 00:04:27,190
same language.
The fact that we,

80
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:28,323
we blend our variety of speech with that
Sam written standard and that's what 

81
00:04:31,361 --> 00:04:33,550
helps us to communicate across day 
Alexa.

82
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:34,443
Now the one weakness in this criteria 
and is that there are people who can't 

83
00:04:38,501 --> 00:04:41,290
really speak to the standard language 
that well.

84
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:42,513
So that's true in English.
You have some people who are uneducated 

85
00:04:44,391 --> 00:04:46,390
and maybe they're poor,
maybe high school dropouts,

86
00:04:46,391 --> 00:04:49,750
maybe they're the type of people who 
just don't really care about studying or

87
00:04:49,751 --> 00:04:50,584
speaking properly.
They don't really know the standard 

88
00:04:52,091 --> 00:04:53,620
language.
They might understand it,

89
00:04:53,621 --> 00:04:54,454
but they can't speak like that.
So are those speakers have the same 

90
00:04:56,981 --> 00:04:57,814
language even though they don't really 
know how to use the standard written 

91
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:03,580
language properly.
So that's kind of the trouble with,

92
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:04,900
with that criterion.

93
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:05,763
But so far that's the best criteria that
I've found to explain what is a dialect 

94
00:05:10,031 --> 00:05:13,420
and what's a language that written 
common standard language.

95
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:14,553
Now as with all things in life,
the situation gets just messy when we 

96
00:05:17,771 --> 00:05:20,950
bring politics into it,
because sometimes we have a,

97
00:05:20,951 --> 00:05:24,700
we have two varieties of language that 
are almost exactly the same,

98
00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:25,683
but they have two different names in two
different countries or their spoken by 

99
00:05:28,721 --> 00:05:32,230
two different ethnic groups and they 
both clem that language as their own.

100
00:05:32,231 --> 00:05:35,440
So they call it by different names and 
it causes a lot of weird confusion.

101
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:36,603
So I've,
I think it's like that in the former 

102
00:05:38,141 --> 00:05:40,080
Yugoslavia for some of the languages 
there,

103
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:44,140
there are people who just don't want to 
be associated with the other people.

104
00:05:44,141 --> 00:05:44,974
So they,
they called the language by the name of 

105
00:05:46,241 --> 00:05:49,300
their own ethnic group,
even though it's the Sam as the language

106
00:05:49,301 --> 00:05:50,800
of another ethnic group basically.

107
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:52,113
So even though the standard written 
language might be pretty much the Sam 

108
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:57,010
might be slightly different,
but it's pretty much the,

109
00:05:57,650 --> 00:05:59,780
and the spoken language is pretty much 
the same.

110
00:05:59,781 --> 00:06:02,780
Maybe with some variation,
but they're mutually intelligible.

111
00:06:02,810 --> 00:06:06,080
Even the standard written languages 
mutually intelligible,

112
00:06:06,290 --> 00:06:10,010
but they call it a different language 
because of whack ass politics.

113
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:12,230
I don't like politics.
I'm not a political person.

114
00:06:12,231 --> 00:06:14,690
I'm more interested in cultures and in 
people,

115
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:18,170
so I don't really buy that definition.
I don't like it when people say we speak

116
00:06:18,171 --> 00:06:19,004
a different language because we have a 
different ethnic group at different 

117
00:06:21,681 --> 00:06:24,290
nationality.
We're going to call this language hours.

118
00:06:24,291 --> 00:06:25,460
It's not yours,
it's ours.

119
00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:26,623
I don't really like that kind of 
territorial claiming of languages so I 

120
00:06:29,361 --> 00:06:30,194
don't buy this definition.
I think if you can speak together with 

121
00:06:33,531 --> 00:06:35,180
each other and it's mutually 
intelligible,

122
00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:36,320
you can read the same books.

123
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:38,960
Then in my opinion you're speaking the 
same language.

124
00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:39,823
I don't really buy the political 
definition of what's the language and 

125
00:06:41,931 --> 00:06:42,764
what's a dialect.
So basically my definition of a dialect 

126
00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:51,290
is that it's mutually comprehensible 
with another variety of language.

127
00:06:51,530 --> 00:06:53,900
So if you can communicate with them,
they understand you,

128
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:54,823
you understand them,
and you can use the written language 

129
00:06:57,260 --> 00:07:00,290
elements of the written language to make
yourself even more understood.

130
00:07:00,590 --> 00:07:03,440
Then I think you were speaking dialects 
of the same language.

131
00:07:03,530 --> 00:07:04,363
I hope that is helpful.
I hope that gives you some something to 

132
00:07:06,801 --> 00:07:09,110
think about.
Leave your comments down below.

133
00:07:09,111 --> 00:07:12,110
Tell me if you agree with my opinion on 
this matter.

134
00:07:12,290 --> 00:07:14,750
All right,
this is Paul signing off.
