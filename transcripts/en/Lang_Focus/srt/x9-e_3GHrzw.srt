Hello everyone.
Welcome to the Lange Focus Channel and 

2
00:00:09,211 --> 00:00:10,044
my name is Paul.
Today's topic is the Japanese language 

3
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:14,213
or as it's called in Japanese.
Japanese has around 126 million native 

4
00:00:19,941 --> 00:00:23,600
speakers making it the ninth most spoken
language in the world.

5
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:24,493
If we focus on native speakers alone,
it's spoken mainly in the Northeast 

6
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:28,873
Asian nation of Japan and also to a 
limited extent in some immigrant 

7
00:00:31,971 --> 00:00:36,140
communities and amongst some elderly 
people living in Japan's former colonies

8
00:00:36,141 --> 00:00:36,974
like Korea and Taiwan.
Japanese belongs to the Japonica 

9
00:00:39,951 --> 00:00:40,784
language family,
which also includes the endangered Yuku 

10
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:46,220
on languages of Okinawa and the Emami 
islands,

11
00:00:46,310 --> 00:00:47,143
but the early history of Japanese and 
its relationship to other languages is 

12
00:00:50,481 --> 00:00:53,660
largely unknown.
There are theories that the Japanese and

13
00:00:53,661 --> 00:00:57,950
Korean languages share a common ancestor
and there are theories that Japanese and

14
00:00:57,951 --> 00:00:58,784
Korean are part of a wider language 
family called the [inaudible] language 

15
00:01:01,671 --> 00:01:02,504
family,
which also includes the Turkic 

16
00:01:03,591 --> 00:01:04,424
languages,
Mongolian and the tongue gooseneck 

17
00:01:06,141 --> 00:01:06,974
languages,
but the alltech language family and the 

18
00:01:09,261 --> 00:01:10,094
connection between Japanese and Korean 
are theoretic there hotly debated and 

19
00:01:13,551 --> 00:01:14,990
are not generally accepted.

20
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:16,213
There are also theories that Japanese 
are rose from contact between the 

21
00:01:19,011 --> 00:01:19,844
language of the aoe people who migrated 
from the North East Asia and mainland 

22
00:01:23,061 --> 00:01:23,894
into Japan two to 3000 years ago and the
language or languages of the Jomon 

23
00:01:28,071 --> 00:01:28,904
people who were already living there.
But the nature of the languages that 

24
00:01:32,271 --> 00:01:34,850
these two groups of people spoke is not 
clearly known.

25
00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:38,990
Japanese was not a written language in 
its early history during the [inaudible]

26
00:01:38,991 --> 00:01:39,824
period,
which leaves us very little evidence of 

27
00:01:41,391 --> 00:01:45,050
what it was actually like during that 
time in the third century ce,

28
00:01:45,110 --> 00:01:45,943
the Yamato States in Japan established 
relations with China and the next 600 

29
00:01:50,001 --> 00:01:50,834
years would be a period of heavy Chinese
influence during which the rulers and 

30
00:01:54,111 --> 00:01:57,500
the elite sought to emulate many aspects
of Chinese culture.

31
00:01:57,980 --> 00:02:02,480
Written Chinese was probably introduced 
to Japan in the fourth century and since

32
00:02:02,481 --> 00:02:03,314
Japanese had no written form,
classical Chinese became the first 

33
00:02:06,141 --> 00:02:08,180
literary language used by the elite.

34
00:02:08,390 --> 00:02:12,200
Later Chinese characters began being 
adapted to write Japanese.

35
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:13,153
The earliest examples we have of 
Japanese writing are from the eighth 

36
00:02:15,651 --> 00:02:20,640
century and there are two forms,
cumbersome and manual.

37
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:21,493
Ghana come Boone's.
What's the writing of Japanese in 

38
00:02:24,681 --> 00:02:25,514
classical Chinese style using Chinese 
characters to represent the meaning of 

39
00:02:28,851 --> 00:02:32,030
Japanese words.
These texts were essentially Chinese,

40
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:34,520
but were intended to be readable in 
Japanese.

41
00:02:34,850 --> 00:02:35,683
Manual in Ghana was a way of writing 
Japanese entirely in Chinese characters 

42
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:40,663
with most of the characters representing
the phonetic sound of the underlying 

43
00:02:43,731 --> 00:02:46,490
Japanese syllables.
For example,

44
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,353
the Japanese word for Mountain Yama was 
written using these two Chinese 

45
00:02:50,871 --> 00:02:55,070
characters for their phonetic value 
rather than using the Chinese character,

46
00:02:55,071 --> 00:02:55,904
which means mountain,
which is the character used today and 

47
00:02:58,671 --> 00:03:01,480
not one Chinese character was used for 
each sound.

48
00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:04,930
Numerous different characters could be 
used to represent the same sound.

49
00:03:05,170 --> 00:03:07,090
For example,
the syllable car.

50
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:10,090
It could be represented by any of the 
following characters,

51
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:11,883
writing Japanese characters phonetically
using Chinese characters that had no 

52
00:03:15,041 --> 00:03:19,030
connection to the meaning must have felt
like a lot of unnecessary hard work.

53
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:20,013
So two systems of simplified phonetic 
characters developed from the manual 

54
00:03:23,551 --> 00:03:26,110
Ghana System in the eighth and ninth 
centuries.

55
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:28,330
In order to simplify the writing 
process.

56
00:03:28,450 --> 00:03:31,390
These two systems where she had a gunner
and Katakana,

57
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:34,970
one of the main uses of these new kinds 
of systems was to annotate,

58
00:03:34,971 --> 00:03:35,804
to combine texts so that Japanese 
speakers could read these classical 

59
00:03:38,711 --> 00:03:42,160
Chinese or Chinese style texts as though
they were Japanese.

60
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:43,053
Chinese characters represented the 
meaning of the content words while come 

61
00:03:46,031 --> 00:03:50,470
up provided the pronunciation as well as
the grammatical elements and inflections

62
00:03:50,471 --> 00:03:51,304
that were not present in Chinese.
Some diacritic markers also indicated 

63
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:57,940
how to change the word order when 
reading the text in Japanese.

64
00:03:58,180 --> 00:03:59,013
This method of annotating Chinese texts 
with Kona was the precursor to the 

65
00:04:02,441 --> 00:04:03,274
modern Japanese writing system.
Through this process of trying to make 

66
00:04:06,491 --> 00:04:09,970
the written Chinese language fit with 
the spoken Japanese language,

67
00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:10,923
a huge amount of Chinese vocabulary 
entered Japanese Chinese characters 

68
00:04:14,381 --> 00:04:15,214
where sometimes annotated to be 
pronounced with their Chinese 

69
00:04:17,531 --> 00:04:18,364
pronunciation known as on your me and 
sometimes pronounced as a native 

70
00:04:21,881 --> 00:04:22,714
Japanese word with a similar meaning.
These pronunciations are known as who 

71
00:04:25,821 --> 00:04:26,654
Naomi.
Such Chinese words have become an 

72
00:04:28,421 --> 00:04:32,680
integral part of Japanese comprising 60%
of the total vocabulary,

73
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:33,633
particularly in writing.
During the late middle Japanese period 

74
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,233
from the year 1185 to 16 hundreds 
Japanese continued to develop and move 

75
00:04:41,531 --> 00:04:44,270
to closer towards modern Japanese 
pharmacologically.

76
00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:45,303
In particular towards the end of this 
time period in the year 1543 the first 

77
00:04:49,391 --> 00:04:50,224
Europeans visited Japan and some 
European vocabulary entered Japanese 

78
00:04:54,041 --> 00:04:56,320
through contact with traders and 
missionaries.

79
00:04:56,890 --> 00:04:57,723
This contact mostly came to a halt 
during the period of national isolation 

80
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:02,373
from 1603 to 1853 during this time,
contact with foreigners was strictly 

81
00:05:07,181 --> 00:05:12,040
limited to a couple of specific places 
like the Dutch trading post dead Jima in

82
00:05:12,041 --> 00:05:15,220
Nagasaki.
A significant number of Dutch loan words

83
00:05:15,221 --> 00:05:17,350
did enter Japanese during this time 
period.

84
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:22,390
Some of them common everyday words like 
from clueless,

85
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:26,230
from lump,
from coffee,

86
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:28,233
from cope.
These words are examples of lone words 

87
00:05:31,511 --> 00:05:33,760
aside from Chinese borrowings and 
compounds.

88
00:05:33,790 --> 00:05:36,130
Normally loan words from European 
languages,

89
00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:37,023
which are normally written in Katakana.
This period of isolation took place 

90
00:05:40,121 --> 00:05:44,220
during the Ed Oh period during which the
Capitol moved from conside to adal.

91
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:45,303
Present Day Tokyo and the Ed or dialect 
became the standard variety of Japanese 

92
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:53,920
after this period of isolation ended in 
1853 interaction with the.
