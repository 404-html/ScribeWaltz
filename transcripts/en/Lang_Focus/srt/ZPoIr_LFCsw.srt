1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:01,273
Uh,
no.

2
00:00:01,570 --> 00:00:02,760
Say,
uh,

3
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:05,250
Paul,
uh,

4
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:07,440
[inaudible] Burke,
Cornell,

5
00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:10,800
uh,
man,

6
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:11,663
I've been studying Indonesian for six 
months and 17 days and I still can't 

7
00:00:15,241 --> 00:00:16,500
introduce myself.
What's going

8
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:17,353
and Andrea.

9
00:00:23,770 --> 00:00:24,760
Hi Guys.
This is Paul.

10
00:00:24,761 --> 00:00:25,594
Today I want to talk to you about one of
the most important elements of learning 

11
00:00:29,531 --> 00:00:32,800
a language of studying a language.
And that is consistency.

12
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:36,250
This is one of my mottos is consistency 
is king.

13
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:39,820
If you read my blog or something you've 
ever talked to me about languages,

14
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:43,190
you probably heard me say that slogan,
that model,

15
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:45,430
the consistency is king.
Uh,

16
00:00:45,610 --> 00:00:46,443
the people who really get good at 
languages are the people who study 

17
00:00:50,411 --> 00:00:51,244
consistently.
They study every day come hell or high 

18
00:00:53,291 --> 00:00:54,124
water.
They don't find excuses to skip the 

19
00:00:56,271 --> 00:00:57,104
studying.
The people who don't really learn as 

20
00:00:59,531 --> 00:01:00,364
much,
the people who,

21
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:01,493
Ooh,
don't get that good that people would 

22
00:01:02,701 --> 00:01:04,220
learn just a bit.
Um,

23
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:06,220
those are the people who just study 
whenever,

24
00:01:06,221 --> 00:01:07,030
right?
I feel like it,

25
00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:10,690
the people who don't study consistently,
they just study based on a whim.

26
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:14,710
So I like to think about consistency in 
a couple of ways.

27
00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:16,720
The first way is like this,
um,

28
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:21,850
your language ability is like a bucket 
with a small hole in the bottom,

29
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:23,373
right?
Uh,

30
00:01:23,390 --> 00:01:24,223
so the water,
the liquid inside is your language 

31
00:01:25,841 --> 00:01:26,674
ability and if you stopped studying,
then there's a slow leak and your 

32
00:01:30,941 --> 00:01:34,210
ability will slowly diminish if you 
don't talk about the bucket.

33
00:01:34,450 --> 00:01:37,750
But if you top up the bucket every day 
by studying,

34
00:01:37,751 --> 00:01:40,130
then you can maintain the level,
uh,

35
00:01:40,210 --> 00:01:42,550
consistently.
You can maintain a certain level or even

36
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:45,260
raise the level of the liquid inside the
bucket.

37
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:47,960
But it's when you stop studying,
when you're not consistent,

38
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:49,153
then gradually day by day,
each day a little bit of the liquid 

39
00:01:52,341 --> 00:01:54,680
leaks out the bottom and the level 
diminishes.

40
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,960
So that's like your language ability 
going down.

41
00:01:57,230 --> 00:01:58,063
So if you've ever studied a language for
a couple months and then you took a few 

42
00:02:01,910 --> 00:02:02,743
weeks off,
like maybe you just lost motivation or 

43
00:02:04,221 --> 00:02:05,870
whatever,
then you came back to it.

44
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:06,703
You probably noticed if you probably 
felt that you had lost the majority of 

45
00:02:10,701 --> 00:02:12,230
what you had learned.
Right?

46
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:13,503
Uh,
so that's because you had that little 

47
00:02:14,241 --> 00:02:18,320
bit of liquid in the bucket.
And then it gradually mostly leaked out.

48
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:20,390
There was probably some residue in 
there,

49
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:21,283
a few drops,
but you probably lost a lot of the meat 

50
00:02:23,451 --> 00:02:24,980
of what you had learned.
So,

51
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:26,150
um,
it's one,

52
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:27,530
uh,
one example.

53
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:28,783
Uh,
you,

54
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:29,633
if you've ever been a couple of years 
into studying a language like a year or 

55
00:02:32,211 --> 00:02:34,280
two,
and then you took a few weeks off,

56
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:37,460
you probably noticed that your level had
diminished a bit.

57
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,353
Probably it had gone down,
but you probably didn't feel like you 

58
00:02:41,690 --> 00:02:42,523
lost most of what you've learned because
it's that gradual diminishment is that 

59
00:02:45,921 --> 00:02:48,290
gradual lowering of the level.
It's a slow leak.

60
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:51,030
So the more of a beginner you are,
uh,

61
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:54,320
the more of your ability you will lose 
if you're not consistent.

62
00:02:54,810 --> 00:02:55,643
Uh,
but the way to always maintain your 

63
00:02:56,691 --> 00:02:57,524
level and to keep increasing it is to be
consistent and top up the bucket every 

64
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:02,853
day.
So that's one way I like to think about 

65
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:05,523
your consistency of and studying.
The other way I like to think about it 

66
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:10,230
is,
uh,

67
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:15,040
in terms of investing,
when you invest money over time,

68
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,140
uh,
when you do it consistently,

69
00:03:17,141 --> 00:03:19,690
you can gain compound interest,
right?

70
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:22,750
Uh,
that means that you make interest on the

71
00:03:22,751 --> 00:03:23,584
money that you invest,
but then you make interest on the 

72
00:03:25,151 --> 00:03:27,330
interest as well.
Uh,

73
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:31,510
this is similar to a phenomenon that 
I've noticed when studying consistently.

74
00:03:31,511 --> 00:03:35,710
When you study every day consistently 
and you don't take days off,

75
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:36,933
you're learning kind of takes on a life 
of its own and you end up learning more 

76
00:03:40,211 --> 00:03:42,910
than you would expect from the amount 
you're studying.

77
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:44,430
Right?
Um,

78
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:47,620
that's partly because just your brain is
learning,

79
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:48,723
uh,
in the off time when you're not 

80
00:03:49,691 --> 00:03:50,524
studying,
it's kind of processing things in the 

81
00:03:51,671 --> 00:03:52,660
background all day.

82
00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:56,020
Uh,
but basically if you are consistent,

83
00:03:56,050 --> 00:03:56,883
then you can get your,
your learning to sort of critical mass 

84
00:04:00,131 --> 00:04:00,964
where it starts to take on a life of its
own and you learn more than you would 

85
00:04:03,911 --> 00:04:06,610
have if you had studied that same number
of days.

86
00:04:06,611 --> 00:04:10,000
But with breaks in between.
So it's really important to,

87
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:11,223
um,
to always keep investing on a daily 

88
00:04:13,391 --> 00:04:15,480
basis,
investing regularly so they could,

89
00:04:15,481 --> 00:04:18,310
you can get that compounding effect in 
your learning.

90
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:19,383
Okay.
So that's another way I like to think 

91
00:04:20,051 --> 00:04:20,930
about it.
So there's the,

92
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:24,340
the bucket with a hole in the bottom,
but then there's compounding interest.

93
00:04:24,341 --> 00:04:25,174
There's those two ways.
So the most important point is study 

94
00:04:28,481 --> 00:04:29,770
every day.
Be Consistent.

95
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:32,040
Also put in a certain amount of time 
everyday.

96
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,970
Try to commit as much time to it as you 
can.

97
00:04:33,971 --> 00:04:37,780
But more important than that is to do it
consistently every day.

98
00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:41,740
How do you be consistent?
That's the question that remains.

99
00:04:41,741 --> 00:04:46,600
A lot of people intend to be consistent,
but they end up taking a lot of time,

100
00:04:46,601 --> 00:04:47,434
often being inconsistent.
So those people usually are taking 

101
00:04:52,511 --> 00:04:55,210
action based on how they feel at the 
moment.

102
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:57,310
They wake up in the morning and they 
think,

103
00:04:57,311 --> 00:04:58,450
oh,
I'm tired today.

104
00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:00,250
A screw it.
I just want to study today.

105
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:01,503
Uh,
they're basing their actions on the 

106
00:05:03,461 --> 00:05:04,294
feeling of that moment,
which is something you can't really 

107
00:05:06,221 --> 00:05:06,911
control.
I mean,

108
00:05:06,911 --> 00:05:11,170
the way you feel depends on all sorts of
different factors out of your control.

109
00:05:11,171 --> 00:05:14,260
It depends on maybe what you ate 
yesterday.

110
00:05:14,261 --> 00:05:17,440
It depends on the weather.
It depends on how well you slept,

111
00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:19,510
depends on stress at work,
all these things.

112
00:05:19,730 --> 00:05:20,563
Uh,
so you can't really control it that 

113
00:05:21,881 --> 00:05:25,720
easily unless you're always monitoring 
all those things really closely.

114
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,033
So the way to,
the way to take action should be based 

115
00:05:29,561 --> 00:05:30,394
on your vision for your outcome,
what you want to get out of learning 

116
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:35,584
that language.

117
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:39,850
And also based on just the commitment,
a commitment to achieving that outcome,

118
00:05:39,851 --> 00:05:40,684
achieving that vision.
So let's say you want to be a French 

119
00:05:43,091 --> 00:05:44,770
English translator.
That's your dream.

120
00:05:45,130 --> 00:05:47,740
So you have to have that vision in mind 
for the future,

121
00:05:47,770 --> 00:05:49,180
that goal,
what will that look like?

122
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:53,140
And then a commitment to work hard every
day to achieve then,

123
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:55,180
right?
So then in that case,

124
00:05:55,181 --> 00:05:56,014
if you have that vision and commitment 
when you up in the morning and you're 

125
00:05:58,101 --> 00:06:02,390
tired or you're hung over or whatever,
then you will just tell yourself,

126
00:06:02,391 --> 00:06:03,890
okay,
I don't feel like it today,

127
00:06:03,891 --> 00:06:06,050
but I have that vision.
And the commitment.

128
00:06:06,051 --> 00:06:09,050
So I'm going to do it anyway because 
it's not based on the feeling.

129
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:10,333
So that's how you,
that's how you can be consistent is by 

130
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:14,030
doing that.
All right.

131
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:18,230
Don't let it be based on a feeling.
A feeling is changing by the moment.

132
00:06:18,231 --> 00:06:22,550
It's out of your control.
A base it on your vision and commitment.

133
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:24,020
All right.
Hope that's helpful.

134
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:26,410
Thank you very much for listening and 
talk to you,

135
00:06:26,411 --> 00:06:27,244
right?

136
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:33,913
Yeah.
