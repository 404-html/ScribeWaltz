Hello everyone.
Welcome to the Lange focus channel.

2
00:00:03,001 --> 00:00:03,834
My name is Paul.
Today I want to talk about knowing your 

3
00:00:06,421 --> 00:00:07,254
learning style.
Most people rely on other people or on 

4
00:00:10,321 --> 00:00:14,070
their materials to teach them,
but I want you to be empowered and to be

5
00:00:14,071 --> 00:00:16,170
able to direct your own language 
learning.

6
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:20,160
That's why today we are going to look at
your learning style and how to use it to

7
00:00:20,161 --> 00:00:23,250
learn more efficiently.
Different people learn differently.

8
00:00:23,251 --> 00:00:24,084
We all have a unique learning style that
is based on the type of sensory 

9
00:00:26,851 --> 00:00:27,684
information that we prefer.
These kinds of sensory information are 

10
00:00:30,631 --> 00:00:33,390
called learning modalities and there are
four of them.

11
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:37,140
Some people say three,
I'm going to say for they are visual,

12
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:40,740
auditory,
reading and writing and kinesthetic.

13
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:44,670
You can remember those learning 
modalities based on the acronym Mark V,

14
00:00:44,671 --> 00:00:48,600
a r k students generally have a dominant
modality,

15
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:51,360
but they do use a combination of all the
different modalities.

16
00:00:51,361 --> 00:00:52,920
Some people will say,
for example,

17
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:53,933
I'm a visual learner,
but really what they mean is that I am 

18
00:00:55,861 --> 00:00:59,520
primarily a visual learner with some of 
the other modalities as well.

19
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:00,683
There are some people who don't really 
have one strongly dominant modality and 

20
00:01:04,321 --> 00:01:05,250
they call those people.
