Hello everyone,
welcome to the Lange Focus Channel and 

2
00:00:11,111 --> 00:00:14,380
my name is Bob.
Today I'm going to talk about the multis

3
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:15,273
language.
Maltese is a unique and interesting 

4
00:00:17,021 --> 00:00:20,200
language because it is a Semitic 
language with a twist.

5
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:21,153
It is the only Semitic language that is 
an official language of the European 

6
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:26,890
Union.
It is spoken by around 520,000

7
00:00:26,891 --> 00:00:29,650
people,
mostly on the island nation of Malta,

8
00:00:29,651 --> 00:00:31,690
which is an island in the Mediterranean 
Sea,

9
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:36,010
not far from Sicily and not far from 
Tunisia and Libya in North Africa.

10
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:36,933
Some people claim that Maltese is a 
descendant of the ancient Phoenician 

11
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:40,233
language,
but actually there is no linguistic 

12
00:00:41,231 --> 00:00:45,130
evidence for this Maltese as a 
descendant of a dialect of Arabic called

13
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:46,183
low Arabic or Sicilian Arabic,
but it has diverged quite a lot from 

14
00:00:49,451 --> 00:00:53,170
Arabic over the last thousand years or 
so and has now become its own language.

15
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:54,153
The syntax and grammar of Maltese 
remains Arabic and about a third of the 

16
00:00:57,071 --> 00:00:57,904
vocabulary is still Arabic and that 
includes most of the grammatical 

17
00:01:00,251 --> 00:01:03,580
function words as well as a lot of the 
most basic vocabulary.

18
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:06,880
About half of the vocabulary is from 
Italian or Sicilian,

19
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:10,450
and the remaining vocabulary is mostly 
from English and French.

20
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:14,440
It's still considered a Semitic language
because of its Arabic origin and because

21
00:01:14,441 --> 00:01:15,274
of its structure,
but if you take into account all of the 

22
00:01:17,021 --> 00:01:19,600
foreign loan words,
especially the Romance Sloan words,

23
00:01:19,601 --> 00:01:23,560
then it's essentially a hybrid language.
Kind of like a Semitic romance hybrid.

24
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:25,833
So how did this interesting mix of 
influences come together to create 

25
00:01:28,391 --> 00:01:29,410
Maltese?
Well,

26
00:01:29,470 --> 00:01:31,090
it's because of its history,
of course,

27
00:01:31,270 --> 00:01:32,500
the fatigue,
mid caliphate,

28
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:36,130
which covered much of North Africa,
conquered Sicily at the end of the ninth

29
00:01:36,131 --> 00:01:36,964
century and brought their grubby or 
north African dialect of Arabic with 

30
00:01:40,241 --> 00:01:41,440
them.
Then in 10,

31
00:01:41,441 --> 00:01:42,274
49 ce,
Arabic speaking Muslim settlers from 

32
00:01:44,651 --> 00:01:45,484
Sicily arrived in Malta,
which is only about 200 kilometers away 

33
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:52,600
and began to establish communities.
They're in the year 10 91 ce.

34
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:55,870
The normans who were Christians from 
Normandy and present a France,

35
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:58,450
had defeated the Arabs and taken hold of
Sicily,

36
00:01:58,570 --> 00:02:01,990
and then began taking hold of multitude 
under Norman rule.

37
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:02,853
More settlers from Sicily began arriving
in Malta and bringing their language 

38
00:02:05,621 --> 00:02:07,900
with them.
Even though the normans were Christian,

39
00:02:07,901 --> 00:02:08,734
the population of Sicily was still a 
mixture of Christians and Muslims who 

40
00:02:11,951 --> 00:02:14,380
spoke Arabic alongside the Sicilian 
language.

41
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:18,490
After the decline of Norman rule,
the new regime in Sicily expelled all of

42
00:02:18,491 --> 00:02:21,160
the Muslims from Sicily and from Malta 
as well.

43
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:22,143
This was a very significant event 
because it essentially cut off the low 

44
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:28,180
Arabic dialect from the Muslim Arabic 
speaking world,

45
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:29,133
and it also cut it off from the 
classical Arabic language and other 

46
00:02:31,841 --> 00:02:32,674
Arabic speaking lands.
The Qur'an remains a conservative force 

47
00:02:34,931 --> 00:02:38,140
that prevented the dialects from 
changing too much overtime,

48
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:39,183
but in Multa,
that conservative force was no longer 

49
00:02:41,111 --> 00:02:41,944
connected to the dialect,
so the dialect was free to drift off in 

50
00:02:44,261 --> 00:02:46,510
its own direction and become a new 
language.

51
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:50,920
Seek low Arabic diet out in Sicily,
but it continued to be used and evolve.

52
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:51,783
In Malta,
Malta remained part of the Kingdom of 

53
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:54,633
Sicily for several hundred years,
which brought lots of Sicilian 

54
00:02:56,501 --> 00:03:00,370
vocabulary into the language.
The island was controlled by a string of

55
00:03:00,371 --> 00:03:03,040
rulers who influenced the developing 
multis language.

56
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:03,933
One of the most significant regimes to 
rule Malta was the knights hospitaller 

57
00:03:06,851 --> 00:03:09,790
of St John.
A powerful order of nights that assisted

58
00:03:09,791 --> 00:03:12,520
in protected Christian pilgrims on their
way to the holy land.

59
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:13,533
They were given the island of Malta in 
15 slash 30 as an outpost to help 

60
00:03:16,361 --> 00:03:19,090
prevent an automated invasion of Rome 
from the south.

61
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:20,553
They made Italian the official language 
of the island and it remained the 

62
00:03:22,961 --> 00:03:23,794
official language until 1934.
This resulted in a large amount of 

63
00:03:26,741 --> 00:03:28,990
Italian vocabulary entering the 
language.

64
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:29,973
There was also a period of two years 
when Melissa was under French rule and 

65
00:03:32,561 --> 00:03:33,394
just from those two years quite a bit of
French vocabulary entered the language 

66
00:03:35,981 --> 00:03:40,450
too and the island was a British 
protectorate from 1800 to 1956.

67
00:03:40,450 --> 00:03:44,070
And of course that led to the adoption 
of lots of English words into Maltese.

68
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:48,250
So multis is essentially an Arabic 
dialect that has become latinized and to

69
00:03:48,251 --> 00:03:52,300
some extent anglicised.
So how similar is it to Arabic today?

70
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:53,343
Well,
if you know Arabic and you try to read 

71
00:03:54,581 --> 00:03:55,414
some Maltese,
you will quickly realize that it's 

72
00:03:56,801 --> 00:03:57,634
basically Arabic instructor,
but you will also see a lot of foreign 

73
00:04:00,251 --> 00:04:01,084
vocabulary.
Mostly romance vocabulary in it's most 

74
00:04:03,251 --> 00:04:05,440
similar to the mug.
Grab dialects of Arabic,

75
00:04:05,441 --> 00:04:07,990
meaning the dialects of Morocco,
Algeria and Tunisia,

76
00:04:08,050 --> 00:04:08,883
especially the Tunisian dialect.
A lot of Tunisians claim that they can 

77
00:04:11,591 --> 00:04:12,424
quite easily understand multis.
That could be because Tunisian Arabic 

78
00:04:15,341 --> 00:04:16,174
itself has quite a few Italian loan 
words and I also understand that a lot 

79
00:04:18,821 --> 00:04:21,340
of Tunisians can understand standard 
Italian,

80
00:04:21,341 --> 00:04:22,174
so if they speak and Arabic and Italian 
than they can quite easily understand 

81
00:04:25,421 --> 00:04:26,140
multis.

82
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:28,900
Lots of people say that if you know an 
Arabic dialect quite well,

83
00:04:28,901 --> 00:04:29,734
and if you also know Italian,
then reading Maltese won't be much of a 

84
00:04:32,141 --> 00:04:32,974
problem and with some adjustment you can
also learn to understand it fairly 

85
00:04:36,011 --> 00:04:38,110
easily.
That doesn't mean you could speak proper

86
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:39,970
Maltese,
but maybe you could use your Arabic,

87
00:04:39,971 --> 00:04:43,540
endure Italian and sort of pack a 
conversation in a new pigeon language.

88
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:46,780
So let's look at a couple examples.
Sentences of multis.

89
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:50,170
So this sentence here is an example of 
one that's mostly Arabic.

90
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:52,360
By the way,
I've never learned to speak Maltese,

91
00:04:52,361 --> 00:04:56,430
so forgive my pronunciation.
It'll Japa Nandua last populates.

92
00:04:56,990 --> 00:05:01,480
That buck dot mia situ ushered in 
million petta sooner.

93
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,730
Now I understood this sentence almost 
perfectly,

94
00:05:03,731 --> 00:05:05,850
and it's basically all Arabic.
Uh,

95
00:05:05,890 --> 00:05:07,030
the first word,
illegit boone.

96
00:05:07,031 --> 00:05:10,340
That's Japan on blue.
That's has a last shot.

97
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:13,460
That's the 10th.
That's the biggest pool.

98
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,310
That's the one that's not Arabic,
but that's,

99
00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:17,660
that looks like an Italian lone word to 
me type thing.

100
00:05:17,690 --> 00:05:19,660
Yeah.
So that's in the world.

101
00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:21,870
The appetite mean that means with more 
of them.

102
00:05:21,970 --> 00:05:22,803
And then there's the Arabic number,
mia said to ocean and then there's 

103
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,770
mulloon which is million and Arabic too.
And then pepper summa,

104
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:29,613
which is not Arabic,
but I guess that's from Italian 

105
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:32,103
Sicilian.
But sometimes you see sentences with a 

106
00:05:33,431 --> 00:05:35,560
lot more loan words,
particularly Italian.

107
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:36,573
Here's another sentence you form a field
of [inaudible] on that includes the 

108
00:05:39,211 --> 00:05:41,070
other printer.
Pewter Solid Arrietta.

109
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:42,093
So this sentence means migration reform 
must include the principle of 

110
00:05:44,951 --> 00:05:47,080
solidarity.
This one has a lot of loan words.

111
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:49,270
The Pharma,
that's not an Arabic word,

112
00:05:49,271 --> 00:05:51,940
that's alone word feeling bigger.
That sione field,

113
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:53,410
that part is Arabic,
but make it.

114
00:05:53,411 --> 00:05:57,680
That's the one that is a long word under
that part is interesting because this is

115
00:05:57,681 --> 00:06:01,240
an Arabic word that means has,
but in this case it's being used to mean

116
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,950
has to or must and it's not used that 
way in Arabic,

117
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:07,760
so the function of this word has become 
somewhat adapted in the multis language.

118
00:06:07,970 --> 00:06:12,170
The next word included.
That's include but that the t links back

119
00:06:12,171 --> 00:06:14,990
to the previous vowel and that's an 
element of Arabic syntax.

120
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:17,980
The next word friendship you.
So that's obviously principal,

121
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:20,030
but that's not an Arabic word.
That's a long word.

122
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:21,620
And tests.
Solar Data Yetta.

123
00:06:21,770 --> 00:06:22,603
Again,
that's the Arabic definite article and 

124
00:06:23,841 --> 00:06:27,070
the t is linking back to the previous 
vowel and solid data yetta.

125
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:29,750
That's solidarity and that's not an 
Arabic word either,

126
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:32,450
so you can see a lot of sentences like 
this and Maltese.

127
00:06:32,451 --> 00:06:35,210
Often if you have no Arabic you'll 
recognize the structure,

128
00:06:35,211 --> 00:06:37,220
but then a lot of the words are not 
Arabic.

129
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:40,370
For me personally,
I know that with my past study of Arabic

130
00:06:40,371 --> 00:06:43,610
and with my fluency in English and my 
recent basic knowledge of Italian,

131
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:47,300
I can take a stab at reading multis and 
I can understand a fair bit of it,

132
00:06:47,330 --> 00:06:48,260
but not all of it.

133
00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:50,930
When I hear spoken Maltese,
I don't really understand it,

134
00:06:50,931 --> 00:06:54,800
but I can pick out some individual 
Arabic and Italian and English words,

135
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:57,050
but I imagined that as my Italian 
improves,

136
00:06:57,051 --> 00:06:57,884
I'll be able to understand a bit more of
it and if I decided to review my Arabic 

137
00:07:01,281 --> 00:07:03,950
in depth and start to learn on my grubby
dialect,

138
00:07:03,951 --> 00:07:07,160
then I think I would be able to 
understand a lot more Maltese as well.

139
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:09,500
Maltese is not a very widely spoken 
language,

140
00:07:09,501 --> 00:07:10,334
so not that many people learn it and 
there aren't that many materials out 

141
00:07:12,471 --> 00:07:15,200
there for learners,
but for someone who's learning Arabic or

142
00:07:15,201 --> 00:07:16,034
learning Italian than it might be fun to
dabble in some multis and see what you 

143
00:07:18,921 --> 00:07:19,754
can make of it.
Thank you for watching the length focus 

144
00:07:21,171 --> 00:07:22,004
channel.
If you have any comments about the 

145
00:07:22,971 --> 00:07:23,804
multis language,
then of course leave them in the 

146
00:07:25,251 --> 00:07:26,270
comments down below.

147

If you're an Arabic speaker and you've 
had a chance to listen to multis a 

148
00:07:29,571 --> 00:07:31,100
little bit,
let us know what you think.

149
00:07:31,101 --> 00:07:33,860
Can you understand it?
Does it sound like a kind of Arabic?

150
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:36,880
And the same goes for Italian speakers.
If you listen to [inaudible],

151
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:38,810
can you catch parts of what they're 
saying?

152
00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:42,800
Let us know in the comments down below,
we're getting close to 50,000

153
00:07:42,801 --> 00:07:45,110
subscribers on Lang Focus.
That's quite cool.

154
00:07:45,111 --> 00:07:45,944
I'm quite excited about that,
but if I look at my social media 

155
00:07:48,441 --> 00:07:50,000
channels,
if I look at facebook,

156
00:07:50,001 --> 00:07:51,380
twitter,
and Instagram,

157
00:07:51,381 --> 00:07:53,450
I noticed that I still don't have that 
many followers,

158
00:07:53,451 --> 00:07:54,284
so be sure to have a look at those.
The link is in the description down 

159
00:07:56,931 --> 00:08:00,380
below and if you find them interesting,
then be sure to follow me there.

160
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:02,560
Thank you for watching and have a nice.
