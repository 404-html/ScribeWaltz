1
00:00:00,970 --> 00:00:04,340
Can I Hebrew speaker understand an 
Arabic speaker?

2
00:00:04,910 --> 00:00:06,770
Well,
the short answer is no.

3
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:12,230
The long answer is Kinda sorta maybe,
but not really.

4
00:00:12,231 --> 00:00:13,064
No.

5
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:19,390
The question,

6
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:20,223
one of the day is how similar our Hebrew
and Arabic as someone who has studied 

7
00:00:24,881 --> 00:00:28,300
both languages,
I get asked this question by quite a few

8
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:29,133
people.
Um,

9
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:30,083
and it's a good question.
It makes me think because I'm not quite 

10
00:00:32,021 --> 00:00:34,960
sure,
but I'll give you my best answer.

11
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:36,093
Basically Hebrew and Arabic are very 
closely related languages and if you 

12
00:00:40,271 --> 00:00:42,280
study both,
that will become very apparent.

13
00:00:42,281 --> 00:00:45,940
You'll see tons of similarities and if 
you know one well already,

14
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:48,490
that will help you learn the other much 
more easily,

15
00:00:49,630 --> 00:00:53,350
but at the same time they are not 
mutually comprehensible.

16
00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:54,710
That means,
uh,

17
00:00:54,730 --> 00:00:57,190
you,
if you speak one and not the other,

18
00:00:57,460 --> 00:00:58,293
that you won't be able to communicate 
with someone who speaks the other 

19
00:01:01,361 --> 00:01:02,590
language.
So they're not,

20
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:03,693
you can't,
you can't communicate as though they're 

21
00:01:05,351 --> 00:01:07,570
the same language and won't work.
Okay.

22
00:01:07,571 --> 00:01:08,404
So let's talk about some things that are
kind of similar and I'll throw in some 

23
00:01:10,901 --> 00:01:12,160
differences as I go.

24
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:13,173
And then I'll talk about how there are 
not really useful as a communication 

25
00:01:17,891 --> 00:01:19,890
tool with each other.
Okay.

26
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:20,733
So they're similar because of the verbal
system and in terms of how you create 

27
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:28,830
words in the language.
So in both Hebrew and Arabic,

28
00:01:28,831 --> 00:01:29,664
they have a system of roots.
Now those roots are usually three 

29
00:01:33,661 --> 00:01:38,520
consonant letters and you take those 
three consonant letters and you put them

30
00:01:38,521 --> 00:01:41,190
into kind of templates that help you 
create a word.

31
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,640
So the templates are patterns.
They're like,

32
00:01:43,641 --> 00:01:45,060
um,
a set of,

33
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:50,450
of a combination of vowels and ethics is
that could be a prefix or suffix or even

34
00:01:51,701 --> 00:01:52,534
an in fix inside the word.
So let's take a three letter root and 

35
00:01:55,741 --> 00:01:57,480
I'll give you an example.
In Hebrew,

36
00:01:57,481 --> 00:02:01,070
you've got the root ca to va,
that's Katie v.

37
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:05,590
If you recognize it,
and in Arabic you've got to book Katie,

38
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,440
be romanized it already.

39
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:10,710
You can see there's a similarity.
That route is almost the same.

40
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:14,400
The book and the va are different,
but low sounds are equivalent.

41
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:17,490
So if you put them into the templates,
you can change it.

42
00:02:17,491 --> 00:02:20,730
Let's use a verb conjugation template in
the past tense.

43
00:02:20,731 --> 00:02:23,280
This is the simplest structure in both 
languages.

44
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:24,690
So in Hebrew,
if you say,

45
00:02:24,691 --> 00:02:25,524
I wrote,
you would say cut off d in Arabic you 

46
00:02:28,201 --> 00:02:29,034
would say the top two or in a dialect 
maybe cut up in Hebrew for the second 

47
00:02:34,681 --> 00:02:36,780
person,
masculine for you,

48
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:40,040
you would say a cutoff in Arabic.
Cut Up top.

49
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:41,273
So you can see that's quite similar for 
the Feminine Second Person Singular in 

50
00:02:46,201 --> 00:02:50,040
Hebrew,
you would say cutoff in Arabic,

51
00:02:50,041 --> 00:02:52,190
you would say.
Okay,

52
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:53,063
so you could see there there's a 
similarity here in the way that you put 

53
00:02:55,830 --> 00:02:59,890
the roots into these templates to 
conjugate the verbs and you can see that

54
00:02:59,891 --> 00:03:02,580
the conjugations are kind of similar.

55
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:03,493
Uh,
the templates are kind of similar but 

56
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:07,780
they're not exactly the same.
And there could be confusion like,

57
00:03:07,781 --> 00:03:09,130
um,
for uh,

58
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:14,370
for the one I said for a in Hebrew,
it's cutoff date that I wrote,

59
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:20,230
but in Arabic means you wrote,
it's when spoken to a female.

60
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:21,333
So you can see there could be a 
confusion there and you might 

61
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:24,333
misunderstand.
I think they're talking about someone 

62
00:03:25,721 --> 00:03:28,000
else.
I'm right.

63
00:03:28,001 --> 00:03:28,834
But she could see that same kind of 
system and that that kind of system of 

64
00:03:31,871 --> 00:03:34,510
templates is used to create nouns to 
create adjectives,

65
00:03:34,511 --> 00:03:35,344
all kinds of words,
just the templates are different and 

66
00:03:37,181 --> 00:03:41,710
have different affixes attached to them 
and different vowels.

67
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:44,650
So that's one thing is that system of 
roots and templates,

68
00:03:44,651 --> 00:03:45,484
it's the same in both.
So if you learn that once for one 

69
00:03:47,321 --> 00:03:48,154
language,
it's just getting that concept down 

70
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,153
really helps you with the second 
language that uses that same system 

71
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:54,453
because it's a bit mind bending at first
to adjust to that route and template 

72
00:03:57,791 --> 00:03:58,624
system.

73
00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:02,170
Another way that there are similar is in
terms of just a lot of vocabulary,

74
00:04:02,171 --> 00:04:04,990
you already saw that that one route,
the cut,

75
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:05,833
the cut the book.
So there's a lot of vocabulary that's 

76
00:04:08,111 --> 00:04:09,970
the same.
It's not the majority of words though.

77
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:12,520
It's not like 80 percent or something 
like that.

78
00:04:12,521 --> 00:04:13,354
It's,
I would,

79
00:04:13,570 --> 00:04:14,403
I don't know the exact percentage.
I would guess that it's about a third 

80
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:22,120
that's just off the top of my head from 
my studying experience.

81
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:23,480
A third,
uh,

82
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:26,710
some of the words are very similar or 
almost the same.

83
00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:30,880
And some are,
some are clearly related,

84
00:04:30,881 --> 00:04:31,714
if you examine the words,
but you might not notice that just from 

85
00:04:34,871 --> 00:04:35,704
hearing them because the phonology of 
the languages has become different due 

86
00:04:39,611 --> 00:04:43,690
to the languages history.
It's similar in French and Italian,

87
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:46,120
French and Italian.
If you read two sentences,

88
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:47,950
um,
equivalent centers,

89
00:04:47,951 --> 00:04:50,410
this side by side,
you can look at them and you can say,

90
00:04:50,411 --> 00:04:52,660
oh,
this word must be the same as this word.

91
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:56,680
This one must be the same as this one 
because the words look kind of similar.

92
00:04:56,681 --> 00:04:58,780
They sound different and the spelling is
different.

93
00:04:58,781 --> 00:05:00,790
But you can look at them and see that 
they're the same.

94
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,370
They have the same meaning because they 
look similar.

95
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:05,110
Uh,
so there are a lot of words like that,

96
00:05:05,111 --> 00:05:08,320
like they're the kind of cognates,
but they're slightly different.

97
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:09,753
Um,
so I'll give you some examples of both 

98
00:05:11,201 --> 00:05:12,790
types.
Like the ones that are very similar,

99
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:13,653
a yad in Hebrew and Arabic,
that means hand dumb in Hebrew and 

100
00:05:18,251 --> 00:05:20,090
Arabic.
That means blood,

101
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:21,400
right?
Um,

102
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:23,950
there's a lot of words that are similar 
like that.

103
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:25,630
The,
almost the same like that.

104
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:28,510
Some that you can figure out quite 
easily with the pronouns,

105
00:05:28,511 --> 00:05:33,511
like I is an the in Hebrew or in Arabic 
or in Hebrew,

106
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:37,920
you for a man as a ta in Arabic gets 
untaught,

107
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:39,093
right?

108
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:43,420
He is who in Hebrew,
it's in Arabic,

109
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:44,620
right?
Um,

110
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:46,570
and that might,
might depend on the dialect to,

111
00:05:46,571 --> 00:05:49,300
in Arabic is different in from country 
to country.

112
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:54,720
Another one kitchen in Hebrew Mitzvah 
and in Arabic gets macbook.

113
00:05:57,050 --> 00:05:57,883
So pretty close.
Just one vowel changes in the Arabic 

114
00:06:00,351 --> 00:06:01,320
one,
uh,

115
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:03,260
some that are a little bit more 
different,

116
00:06:03,261 --> 00:06:04,094
but you can see the similarity,
especially if you know the function or 

117
00:06:06,111 --> 00:06:06,944
meaning of the word,
like this one to you or for you in 

118
00:06:10,011 --> 00:06:12,470
Hebrew is the hot.
But in Arabic it's lack.

119
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,570
So if you look at the vowels,
sorry,

120
00:06:14,571 --> 00:06:15,950
if you look at the consonants you can 
see,

121
00:06:15,951 --> 00:06:17,780
okay,
l k versus l,

122
00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:20,420
C h,
those might be the same,

123
00:06:20,421 --> 00:06:25,370
right?
Of in Hebrew is father Abba in Arabic.

124
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:27,010
So again,
you see that be in the V,

125
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:29,180
another one,
Ben,

126
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:32,540
his son in Hebrew Eban his son in 
Arabic.

127
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,850
So if you just look at the consonants 
that be in the end,

128
00:06:34,851 --> 00:06:35,570
you can say,
oh,

129
00:06:35,570 --> 00:06:37,820
those are related.
Another one,

130
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
rush,
rush means head in Hebrew,

131
00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:44,300
and last,
last means head in Arabic.

132
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:46,970
So that's in rush.
Those are clearly related.

133
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:49,010
Another one,
tongue in Hebrew,

134
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:51,620
lashawn in Arabic.
Listen,

135
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:54,110
the sun,
so the sun and the show,

136
00:06:54,530 --> 00:06:56,550
maybe there's a change there.
And also the,

137
00:06:56,551 --> 00:06:57,384
the old became an r sound.
So there's some shifts in the sounds 

138
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:03,380
going on.
Dog in Hebrew is Kelly in Arabic,

139
00:07:03,381 --> 00:07:04,214
it's called.
So you can see there are a lot of words 

140
00:07:06,171 --> 00:07:10,070
that have a similar,
a similar route or if they come from the

141
00:07:10,071 --> 00:07:10,904
same word,
but they've shifted and become 

142
00:07:11,841 --> 00:07:14,360
different.
So there's a lot of words like that that

143
00:07:14,361 --> 00:07:16,670
you wouldn't necessarily understand when
you hear them.

144
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,400
And other one,
that's this,

145
00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:20,000
uh,
there are some words that are the same,

146
00:07:20,001 --> 00:07:23,390
but they have a different meaning like a
Medina or Medina.

147
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:27,620
In Hebrew,
Medina is state like Israel,

148
00:07:27,621 --> 00:07:30,800
the state of Israel.
But in Arabic Medina means a city.

149
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:34,490
So they're both political entities.
There is a connection in the meaning,

150
00:07:34,491 --> 00:07:37,790
but it's not exactly the same,
meaning the meaning has become different

151
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:42,890
and they're also a lot of words that are
just different entirely.

152
00:07:42,891 --> 00:07:43,724
For whatever reason.
It's always kind of strange to discover 

153
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:48,680
words that are exactly the same in 
Hebrew and Arabic.

154
00:07:48,681 --> 00:07:49,514
And then the next word in the sentence 
is entirely different and you've never 

155
00:07:52,101 --> 00:07:55,550
seen it before.
So like why did this one become the same

156
00:07:55,551 --> 00:07:57,560
in both languages,
but this one is different.

157
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,170
What?
So it makes it kind of interesting.

158
00:08:00,171 --> 00:08:02,420
I don't always know.
You usually don't know the answer,

159
00:08:02,421 --> 00:08:03,920
but yeah.
Anyway,

160
00:08:03,921 --> 00:08:08,600
there's a lot of different vocabulary so
you can see that there are quite related

161
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:09,613
and there's a lot of crossover but you 
won't understand one just by learning 

162
00:08:15,410 --> 00:08:16,243
the other.

163
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:18,620
Right.
It will help you learn the other.

164
00:08:18,621 --> 00:08:19,454
If you make the effort though and if you
take what you know and try to apply it 

165
00:08:23,001 --> 00:08:24,740
to the other language.
Well learning.

166
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:29,630
So let me give you an example of when I 
first went to Egypt in 1997.

167
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:30,913
I went there after having studied Hebrew
for a couple of years already and I was 

168
00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:38,890
visiting Israel and I went to Egypt to,
so I tried to use my Hebrew and apply it

169
00:08:39,741 --> 00:08:42,590
to Arabic because I only knew a little 
bit of Arabic.

170
00:08:42,591 --> 00:08:46,130
I didn't know enough to really to have a
conversation or whatever.

171
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:50,990
So I would try to use my very simple 
Arabic and insert Hebrew words into it.

172
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:56,100
And I knew the difference in phonology,
so I would kind of shift in Arab buys my

173
00:08:56,101 --> 00:08:56,934
pronunciation of the Hebrew words.
And I was surprised by how often people 

174
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:04,770
understood me and the people didn't 
speak Hebrew.

175
00:09:04,770 --> 00:09:06,900
They weren't seen bruce speakers,
but they understood,

176
00:09:07,170 --> 00:09:10,530
I guess they could,
they could hear the word and think of an

177
00:09:10,531 --> 00:09:11,364
equivalent or similar sounding word in 
Arabic or they could cure the root and 

178
00:09:14,821 --> 00:09:17,700
maybe that route was used in a different
word in there,

179
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:20,010
Arabic dialect or whatever.
Uh,

180
00:09:20,011 --> 00:09:22,350
so they could figure out what I was 
saying a lot of the time.

181
00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:23,423
And they looked at me strangely.
They thought maybe I was a Weirdo or I 

182
00:09:27,421 --> 00:09:30,330
remember they often asked me if I was 
from Lebanon,

183
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:31,733
so maybe they thought that my bizarre 
Arabic pigeon language was Lebanese 

184
00:09:36,451 --> 00:09:38,580
Arabic.
That seemed to be something like that.

185
00:09:38,581 --> 00:09:40,290
They kept asking me if I was from 
Lebanon.

186
00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:43,170
Uh,
it happened like that in Jordan too.

187
00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:46,050
I remember when I was in Jordan the same
year,

188
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:48,990
um,
that I,

189
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:54,130
I managed to use some Hebrew words in 
situations where I was surprised that it

190
00:09:54,690 --> 00:09:55,260
went across.

191
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:58,530
So they understood a lot of my Hebrew 
words when I era buys them.

192
00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:02,880
So that's just an example of how the 
language has crossover and you,

193
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:03,813
you can apply one to the other,
but they're generally not mutually 

194
00:10:07,351 --> 00:10:08,184
comprehensible.
You have to make the effort to shift it 

195
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:13,110
to change that knowledge into the other 
language.

196
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:15,600
So that's why there are two different 
languages,

197
00:10:15,601 --> 00:10:18,870
not dialects of the same language.
All right.

198
00:10:18,871 --> 00:10:21,450
So that's,
that's what I wanted to share with you.

199
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:23,610
Just my experience with how similar they
are,

200
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:25,680
give you some similarities,
differences,

201
00:10:25,681 --> 00:10:28,860
and hope you understand a little bit 
better than before.

202
00:10:29,090 --> 00:10:30,450
All right.
Thank you for listening.

203
00:10:30,451 --> 00:10:31,284
Good Nights.
