00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:00,923
Hello everyone.
Today I'm going to talk about language 

2
00:00:02,851 --> 00:00:05,580
learning key number two,
number two,

3
00:00:05,581 --> 00:00:08,280
which is phonology.
This could be number one,

4
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:09,143
but it just so happens that last time I 
talked about a kind of a general study 

5
00:00:12,661 --> 00:00:13,494
habit consistency,
but as far as practical study and 

6
00:00:16,021 --> 00:00:19,800
practical skills of the language,
golf phonology could be number one.

7
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:20,963
I really think that learning the 
phonology of the language is one of the 

8
00:00:23,791 --> 00:00:24,624
most important things.
It's the basis of all of your studies 

9
00:00:27,031 --> 00:00:28,920
and all of you are skills that are to 
come.

10
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:32,430
The phonology means the system of sounds
of that language,

11
00:00:32,550 --> 00:00:35,430
so that includes the pronunciation of 
the consonants and the vowels,

12
00:00:35,431 --> 00:00:38,610
but also the stress patterns and the 
intonation patterns,

13
00:00:38,611 --> 00:00:40,950
that kind of thing.
Basically pronunciation,

14
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,900
you could call it that same kind of 
thing.

15
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:44,093
Now it's extremely important to learn 
the final logical system of each 

16
00:00:46,501 --> 00:00:50,640
language you learned because it's really
what connects you to that language.

17
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:53,100
It's the thing that associated with that
language.

18
00:00:53,101 --> 00:00:55,500
It helps you access your integrated 
skills,

19
00:00:55,501 --> 00:00:57,840
your are synthesized skills in that 
language.

20
00:00:57,930 --> 00:00:58,763
So what I mean by that is this,
if you learn a foreign language but you 

21
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:02,573
use your native languages pronunciation 
or you've just pronunciation that's 

22
00:01:05,671 --> 00:01:08,280
quite close to your native languages 
pronunciation,

23
00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:09,383
then you're never going to fully be able
to access that foreign language or 

24
00:01:12,751 --> 00:01:13,584
access your skills in that foreign 
language because you'll always retreat 

25
00:01:16,291 --> 00:01:19,770
into your native language.
That funnel logical system is associated

26
00:01:19,771 --> 00:01:22,710
with your native language,
so you want to stay away from that.

27
00:01:22,711 --> 00:01:25,770
You want to stay away from the 
phonological system of your own language

28
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:26,783
and as precisely as possible,
learn the phonological system of that 

29
00:01:30,001 --> 00:01:32,520
foreign language that you are studying.
In the past,

30
00:01:32,521 --> 00:01:33,354
before I really figured this out,
I basically had a generic foreign 

31
00:01:36,481 --> 00:01:37,314
language accent.
I would use the same kind of phonology 

32
00:01:40,261 --> 00:01:41,940
for all the different languages I 
learned.

33
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:42,773
It was just like I had a foreign 
language accent that wasn't that 

34
00:01:44,821 --> 00:01:46,950
precise,
so it kind of work that.

35
00:01:46,951 --> 00:01:49,740
The problem was there was some crossover
between languages.

36
00:01:49,741 --> 00:01:50,574
So when I tried to speak one language,
I would sometimes get mixed up and say 

37
00:01:53,611 --> 00:01:54,444
words from the other language or I would
retreat into it on language that I knew 

38
00:01:57,241 --> 00:01:58,074
how to speak better because that 
phonology is anchored to the other 

39
00:02:00,901 --> 00:02:02,970
language,
not only the one I'm learning right now.

40
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,600
So it's really important that you keep 
those languages you learn as distinct as

41
00:02:06,601 --> 00:02:07,434
possible in terms of phonology.
So how do you learn the phonology of a 

42
00:02:10,291 --> 00:02:11,124
new language that you are studying?
Well first you have to perceive the 

43
00:02:14,671 --> 00:02:17,010
phonology,
perceive the sounds of that language,

44
00:02:17,011 --> 00:02:20,580
and then second you have to learn how to
produce the sounds through imitation.

45
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:21,563
Those are the two things.
So let's focus first on perceiving the 

46
00:02:24,721 --> 00:02:25,440
sounds.

47
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,273
You want to pay attention to the sounds 
of the language and the distinctions 

48
00:02:29,071 --> 00:02:33,600
between all of those sounds.
So every beginner's language program out

49
00:02:33,601 --> 00:02:34,434
there,
we'll have some kind of introduction to 

50
00:02:35,911 --> 00:02:36,744
the phonology of the language.
They usually call it the pronunciation 

51
00:02:38,821 --> 00:02:41,220
section and it will show you all of the 
consonants,

52
00:02:41,221 --> 00:02:44,970
all of the vowels in that language.
And just go through the pronunciation of

53
00:02:44,971 --> 00:02:47,490
each one,
maybe just the sound and then an example

54
00:02:47,491 --> 00:02:49,800
where it,
so you should of course go through that.

55
00:02:49,801 --> 00:02:53,730
You should repeat after all the sounds,
repeat after those individual words that

56
00:02:53,731 --> 00:02:54,564
they give as examples.
But then you don't want to just go 

57
00:02:57,091 --> 00:03:00,610
through the introductory pronunciations 
of that language program.

58
00:03:00,611 --> 00:03:01,444
That wouldn't be enough.
That's just giving you a quick idea of 

59
00:03:03,911 --> 00:03:04,744
what sounds exist.
But you want to actually hear them over 

60
00:03:06,881 --> 00:03:07,714
and over numerous times until you can 
perceive them right then so you can't 

61
00:03:10,931 --> 00:03:12,940
hear them and know which sound is being 
said.

62
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:16,180
So it's good to listen to some examples 
of the language,

63
00:03:16,490 --> 00:03:17,323
uh,
inaction.

64
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:18,243
So you want to hear some radio broadcast
or some TV shows or some interviews or 

65
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:25,630
somebodies youtube channel with them 
talking just like I'm talking right now,

66
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:28,210
but in the target language that you want
to learn.

67
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,790
So when you hear those sounds at a 
natural speed,

68
00:03:30,791 --> 00:03:31,624
then you can start to notice and 
perceive those sounds that are 

69
00:03:33,521 --> 00:03:36,730
introduced in that language textbook or 
on the language website.

70
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:37,593
That's your learning from.
If you don't take this time to listen 

71
00:03:40,031 --> 00:03:42,730
and become familiar with the sounds of 
that language,

72
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:46,090
then what's going to happen is you're 
going to start thinking of that language

73
00:03:46,091 --> 00:03:46,924
visually.
You're going to start thinking of the 

74
00:03:47,891 --> 00:03:48,724
language only in terms of the 
orthography in terms of the way it's 

75
00:03:51,221 --> 00:03:52,054
written,
and you're going to think of those 

76
00:03:52,991 --> 00:03:56,950
letters that you see the orthography in 
terms of your own native languages,

77
00:03:56,980 --> 00:03:57,813
phonology.

78
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:59,920
So when you imagined the letters in your
head,

79
00:03:59,921 --> 00:04:02,110
you imagine the word that you are trying
to say,

80
00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:05,380
you're going to save the sounds as you 
would in your own native language.

81
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:07,480
If it was spelled like that.
Here in Japan,

82
00:04:07,481 --> 00:04:08,314
there's a big problem with this.
Like I have students who learned 

83
00:04:10,961 --> 00:04:11,794
English,
but they learned it from someone who 

84
00:04:12,731 --> 00:04:13,564
doesn't really speak English.
They learned it from a Japanese teacher 

85
00:04:15,731 --> 00:04:17,440
in high school who doesn't really speak 
English.

86
00:04:17,441 --> 00:04:18,274
They just taught it from the textbook.
They'd teach them English in the 

87
00:04:21,401 --> 00:04:22,234
Japanese phonological system,
so they can't even perceive the native 

88
00:04:25,871 --> 00:04:27,910
English sounds often.
For example,

89
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:29,880
if they read the word,
uh,

90
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:32,570
ice hockey,
they'll read it as a sewer hook.

91
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:33,413
Gay,
or if they see the word birthday cake 

92
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:35,973
written in English,
they will read it out loud as Butsu day 

93
00:04:38,141 --> 00:04:38,974
cake because they are processing the 
language through their own phonological 

94
00:04:42,701 --> 00:04:43,534
system.

95
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,790
Even if I say it,
if I say birthday cake,

96
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:47,080
he'll look at me like,
what?

97
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:48,750
But if I say boss today,
KCI,

98
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:52,000
they'll understand because they're not 
perceiving the English sounds.

99
00:04:52,001 --> 00:04:55,360
They're not perceiving sounds of the 
word in the English phonological system.

100
00:04:55,361 --> 00:04:58,660
They're only perceiving it if I say it 
in their phonological system.

101
00:04:58,690 --> 00:04:59,523
So that's the problem we want to avoid.
So the first thing that you have to do 

102
00:05:02,111 --> 00:05:05,320
is to learn to perceive the sounds 
before you produce them.

103
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:06,393
The second thing you have to do is to 
learn to produce those sounds through 

104
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:11,200
imitation.
So how can you do that?

105
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:12,213
Well,
the most basic thing you can do is to 

106
00:05:13,391 --> 00:05:14,224
get a teacher or a tutor or someone who 
will work with you together closely and 

107
00:05:17,051 --> 00:05:19,840
monitor you and give you feedback about 
your pronunciation,

108
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:20,733
to help you to make sure that you are 
saying the sounds as precisely as 

109
00:05:23,171 --> 00:05:26,230
possible so that you are off to a good 
start right from the beginning.

110
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:27,063
And then you don't ingrain any bad 
habits of using your own native 

111
00:05:30,011 --> 00:05:30,844
languages phonology.
So having a teacher or a tutor is the 

112
00:05:33,161 --> 00:05:35,260
best way because they can give you that 
feedback.

113
00:05:35,290 --> 00:05:39,310
They can perceive distinctions in the 
sounds that you can't perceive yet.

114
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:40,473
So it's good to have someone,
they're giving you feedback and helping 

115
00:05:42,401 --> 00:05:44,830
you along.
But some of you like to study alone.

116
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:48,130
You don't like to work with the teacher 
right away if you're working alone,

117
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:51,280
if you're studying by yourself with the 
textbook or with some websites,

118
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:52,443
you can do it.
I used to do that until the past couple 

119
00:05:54,670 --> 00:05:55,503
of years and I was always fairly good 
with that because I'm quite an 

120
00:05:57,801 --> 00:05:58,634
independent learner.
But it means that you will have to 

121
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:01,663
really monitor yourself and monitor your
own pronunciation and try to 

122
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:05,743
continuously refine it.
But you can use language cds like the 

123
00:06:08,871 --> 00:06:09,704
CDs that come with your textbook and use
that to chorus or listen and repeat 

124
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:13,790
after the CD you like.

125
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:14,623
You can play a a sentence and then pause
it and repeat after it and try to 

126
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:20,660
pronounce it as closely as possible to 
the CD.

127
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:23,590
You can do that with a lot of youtube 
clips to like watch some,

128
00:06:23,910 --> 00:06:24,743
some youtube channels or some interviews
or TV shows and play short bits and 

129
00:06:28,161 --> 00:06:28,994
pause and then repeat after it.
And then when you get a bit better you 

130
00:06:31,221 --> 00:06:35,780
can start to shadow videos or shadow 
audio cds and that kind of thing.

131
00:06:35,781 --> 00:06:36,614
So shadowing means that you try to 
repeat after it as they're speaking in 

132
00:06:39,471 --> 00:06:40,304
real time,
so you kind of speak right after them 

133
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:44,570
and try to follow them.
It's easy to get lost doing that,

134
00:06:44,571 --> 00:06:45,404
but that's fine.
You just want to be able to shadow as 

135
00:06:47,331 --> 00:06:48,164
much as you can and get.
The basic point is to continuously 

136
00:06:51,171 --> 00:06:53,720
listen and produce the sounds.
At the same time,

137
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:57,260
but it's often the case that people will
do a kind of hybrid of listen and repeat

138
00:06:57,620 --> 00:06:58,490
and shadowing.

139
00:06:58,490 --> 00:07:00,920
Like they'll shadow as much as they can,
but when they get lost,

140
00:07:00,921 --> 00:07:01,754
they'll pause the button then and try to
finish repeating and then they'll 

141
00:07:04,370 --> 00:07:06,740
unpause the button and try to continue.
So that's,

142
00:07:06,770 --> 00:07:07,603
that's fine.
You just want to continuously hear 

143
00:07:09,950 --> 00:07:14,000
native speakers and imitate them and try
to produce the same sounds that they are

144
00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:14,863
making as precisely as you can.
So you just need to monitor yourself 

145
00:07:17,781 --> 00:07:19,970
quite a bit if you're doing this through
self study,

146
00:07:20,090 --> 00:07:21,800
but it can work.
Also,

147
00:07:21,801 --> 00:07:22,634
don't forget the stress patterns and 
intonation patterns because even though 

148
00:07:25,461 --> 00:07:26,294
those usually aren't the introductory 
sounds that you are tight in your 

149
00:07:28,731 --> 00:07:29,564
language program,
those carry a lot of meaning and they 

150
00:07:31,821 --> 00:07:34,970
also can mean the difference between one
word and another word,

151
00:07:34,971 --> 00:07:35,804
especially the stress patterns.
The stress panners can create 

152
00:07:38,031 --> 00:07:40,130
distinctions and meanings.
So don't forget about those.

153
00:07:40,131 --> 00:07:41,180
Try to imitate those.

154
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:44,200
Those ones are not really conscious.
I mean the,

155
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:46,490
it's difficult to consciously refine 
them,

156
00:07:46,491 --> 00:07:50,630
but you just want to just pay attention 
to the overall patterns of intonation.

157
00:07:50,690 --> 00:07:51,523
Repeat what you hear,
and subconsciously you're going to 

158
00:07:53,241 --> 00:07:54,074
internalize those patterns without 
really thinking about it as long as you 

159
00:07:56,391 --> 00:08:01,010
are intentionally imitating native 
speakers or fluid near native speakers.

160
00:08:01,011 --> 00:08:03,950
So that is language learning.
Key number two,

161
00:08:03,951 --> 00:08:04,784
it is phonology.
Make sure you get the basics at the 

162
00:08:07,071 --> 00:08:07,904
phonology down quite well at the 
beginning before you start getting into 

163
00:08:10,731 --> 00:08:13,880
learning all the grammar and um,
doing a lot of conversation.

164
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:16,790
Get the phonology down from day one.
It's very important.

165
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:17,653
It is the key to accessing that language
and not crossing wires with different 

166
00:08:21,831 --> 00:08:24,530
languages and not retreating into your 
native language.

167
00:08:24,590 --> 00:08:27,800
So learn the phonology and that will 
help you a ton.

168
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:30,730
All right,
this is Paul signing off and have a good

169
00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:35,790
thanks.
