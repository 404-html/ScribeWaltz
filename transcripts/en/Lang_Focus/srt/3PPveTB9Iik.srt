00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:07,493
Good evening guys,
this is a video about studying multiple 

2
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:11,033
foreign languages and how you can switch
between those different languages 

3
00:00:14,731 --> 00:00:17,520
without getting confused and mixed up.
A.

4
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:18,373
You've looked at my channel before.
You've seen that I've studied a number 

5
00:00:20,941 --> 00:00:21,774
of different foreign languages.
Maybe you've studied a number of 

6
00:00:23,791 --> 00:00:24,624
different foreign languages and maybe 
you found it kind of confusing or maybe 

7
00:00:27,901 --> 00:00:28,734
you've found there's some overlap 
between the language or you've crossed 

8
00:00:31,951 --> 00:00:32,784
wires between language.
Maybe it gets confusing when you study 

9
00:00:35,641 --> 00:00:36,474
more than one.
How do you keep them all inside your 

10
00:00:37,861 --> 00:00:41,160
head and be able to speak more than a 
couple languages,

11
00:00:41,161 --> 00:00:42,120
like five,
six,

12
00:00:42,121 --> 00:00:44,070
seven languages?
How do you do it?

13
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:45,630
Well,
keep in mind,

14
00:00:45,631 --> 00:00:46,464
I'm talking from the point of view of 
someone who has studied all these 

15
00:00:48,871 --> 00:00:50,310
foreign languages.
As an adult,

16
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:54,230
I didn't learn any foreign language or 
second language as a kid.

17
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:56,820
I was raised monolingual just speaking 
English.

18
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,390
So this is from that point of view of 
learning as an adult.

19
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:04,740
Someone who learned that as a kid might 
be different to keep that in mind.

20
00:01:04,970 --> 00:01:05,970
Um,
okay.

21
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:09,390
So basically there are three things.
I'll start with the first one.

22
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:10,583
I think you really need to refine your 
pronunciation for each of the languages 

23
00:01:15,151 --> 00:01:17,700
you really need to get specific with 
your,

24
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:18,613
uh,
with the distinctions you make in the 

25
00:01:20,191 --> 00:01:21,024
phonology,
so really look at all the different 

26
00:01:22,231 --> 00:01:23,064
sounds in each language and get them as,
as specific and as precise as possible 

27
00:01:28,410 --> 00:01:33,410
because I think a lot of what causes 
crossover between different languages is

28
00:01:34,231 --> 00:01:38,940
that you were using the same phonology 
or similar phonology for those languages

29
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:41,760
when a native speaker has a very 
precise,

30
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:42,683
distinct phonology for that language.
So this is something that my theory on 

31
00:01:47,731 --> 00:01:51,000
this came from studying a few different 
languages.

32
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:55,170
I studied Hebrew and Arabic,
which are quite related,

33
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,960
but the phonology isn't that similar.
The quite different.

34
00:01:58,380 --> 00:01:59,213
But also I've studied French and I find 
that I've had a lot more crossover 

35
00:02:03,271 --> 00:02:07,320
between French and Hebrew.
Then between Arabic and Hebrew,

36
00:02:07,321 --> 00:02:11,410
even though French and Hebrew are not 
related really a.

37
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:12,483
and that's because there are some 
similar phonological sounds between 

38
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:16,613
Hebrew in French that are,
that don't exist between Hebrew and 

39
00:02:19,951 --> 00:02:20,784
Arabic.
So that's caused some of the crossover 

40
00:02:23,641 --> 00:02:25,080
between them.
It's the phonology,

41
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:28,320
it's the similar phonology.
So in order to solve that problem,

42
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:33,150
I had to really get precise with my 
phonology for French and for Hebrew,

43
00:02:33,151 --> 00:02:33,984
I had to look at all the sounds,
look at exactly how to pronounce those 

44
00:02:36,931 --> 00:02:41,100
sounds that were causing the confusion.
So you can do that.

45
00:02:41,101 --> 00:02:43,560
I mean,
when I say refine your pronunciation,

46
00:02:43,561 --> 00:02:47,280
that's in general,
focus on studying your pronunciation and

47
00:02:47,281 --> 00:02:49,500
improving it,
get some help from native speakers,

48
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:52,110
really focused on emulating native 
speakers,

49
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:56,450
but also at a more advanced level of 
teach you a little technique that,

50
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:57,613
uh,
that helps people take it to a more 

51
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:02,170
native level or near native level.

52
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:03,333
The technique is this imagined that a 
particular native speaker is actually 

53
00:03:08,891 --> 00:03:11,410
speaking through you.
It might sound strange,

54
00:03:11,411 --> 00:03:12,244
but there you're kind of channeling a 
certain person through your body and 

55
00:03:14,921 --> 00:03:17,560
they're speaking out your mouth.
Like when I speak French,

56
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:21,820
I imagined that Sarcowski,
the former president,

57
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:22,683
is speaking through me because he's 
somebody that I modeled when I was 

58
00:03:25,601 --> 00:03:26,434
studying French.
I paid attention to his pronunciation 

59
00:03:27,941 --> 00:03:32,170
and tried to copy his intonation.
So when I speak French,

60
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:35,560
when I'm trying to get precise with my 
pronunciation,

61
00:03:35,561 --> 00:03:38,070
I imagined it's him speaking through me.
All right?

62
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:38,913
And when I speak Tagalog,
I imagine a certain Filipino person who 

63
00:03:41,921 --> 00:03:42,754
I know who speaks to,
I imagine that person is speaking 

64
00:03:44,831 --> 00:03:48,350
through me.
And by doing that you're really,

65
00:03:48,351 --> 00:03:49,760
um,
your,

66
00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:51,123
your brain is picking up on a lot of 
very little subtle cues and the 

67
00:03:53,651 --> 00:03:56,500
pronunciation that you can't pick up on 
consciously.

68
00:03:56,590 --> 00:03:58,840
If you try to focus on all those little 
differences,

69
00:03:59,080 --> 00:03:59,913
you can't really do it,
but if you just focus on the whole 

70
00:04:02,111 --> 00:04:05,230
person,
your unconscious mind can pick up on all

71
00:04:05,231 --> 00:04:09,970
those little fine tuned elements of the 
pronunciation and help you out a lot.

72
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:14,020
So that's one thing.
It's one trick you can try a for getting

73
00:04:14,021 --> 00:04:16,720
your pronunciation to a more authentic 
level.

74
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:19,540
Okay?
So focus on the pronunciation.

75
00:04:19,541 --> 00:04:20,374
That's my first piece of advice.
The second thing is 100 percent 

76
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:26,150
commitment,
no half stepping,

77
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:30,520
100 percent commitment when you are 
switching into the next language.

78
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:31,593
Okay?
So when you were moving from one 

79
00:04:33,521 --> 00:04:34,354
language into the other,
it's kind of like you are walking 

80
00:04:36,581 --> 00:04:37,414
through a doorway into another room.
If you enter the doorway and you just 

81
00:04:42,131 --> 00:04:46,030
stand in the doorway and try to speak 
the other language of the other room,

82
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:48,100
you're going to retreat into the first 
road.

83
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,230
You're going to go back into the other 
language,

84
00:04:50,231 --> 00:04:52,480
or you're going to get some crossover 
between the two.

85
00:04:52,481 --> 00:04:56,380
You'll find it hard to really move into 
the second language.

86
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,290
So what you really need to do is just 
make a firm decision,

87
00:04:59,291 --> 00:05:00,124
okay,
now I'm switching into the other 

88
00:05:01,391 --> 00:05:04,540
language.
I'm not going back into the old one.

89
00:05:04,541 --> 00:05:07,990
I'm walking through the doorway and I'm 
closing the door behind me,

90
00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:09,363
right?
So you're,

91
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:11,320
you're basically just completely 
deciding,

92
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:13,780
I'm speaking this language now and not 
the other.

93
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:17,320
You don't want to switch back and forth.
So you want to just lock the door behind

94
00:05:17,321 --> 00:05:18,154
you.
Okay?

95
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:21,850
So it's really just about pushing 
yourself and making a firm commitment.

96
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:25,630
And when you make that firm decision to 
speak this one,

97
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:30,631
then it just motivates you and pushes 
you forward and takes you into that zone

98
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:32,470
of that language.
Okay.

99
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:35,380
So that's the second thing is just that 
100 percent decision.

100
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:36,970
Okay,
I'm going to speak French now.

101
00:05:36,971 --> 00:05:40,480
I'm going to speak Arabic now and 
completely cut off the language.

102
00:05:40,481 --> 00:05:43,360
You were speaking a moment earlier.
All right,

103
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:44,223
so that's number two.
Number three is a little more abstract 

104
00:05:46,091 --> 00:05:49,060
and it's one that I don't use all that 
often anymore,

105
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:49,953
but I used it.
I've tried it in the past and made use 

106
00:05:52,181 --> 00:05:54,400
of it when I needed it.
And it's like this,

107
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:55,573
you imagine a scene that you associate 
with the language that you want to 

108
00:06:00,141 --> 00:06:01,910
speak.
So for example,

109
00:06:01,911 --> 00:06:02,744
when I speak French,
I might imagine the scene on the patio 

110
00:06:06,051 --> 00:06:08,000
of a cafe in Paris,
right?

111
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:08,893
And imagine all of the subtle little,
the subtle little sensory cues that go 

112
00:06:13,851 --> 00:06:14,840
along with that,
like,

113
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:17,590
um,
the taste of wine at the smell of my,

114
00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:20,010
my baguettes and all that kind stuff.
Um,

115
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,073
and hearing the ambiance around me,
hearing the French language spoken 

116
00:06:23,570 --> 00:06:25,730
around me,
so by doing that,

117
00:06:25,731 --> 00:06:28,910
you,
you're creating a connection between the

118
00:06:28,911 --> 00:06:32,800
language and that image so that whenever
you want to move into that,

119
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:33,933
that state in which you are speaking the
language well than you imagine that 

120
00:06:37,670 --> 00:06:40,550
image and that brings you into the zone 
of that language.

121
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:43,130
Okay?
So that's something you can try.

122
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:46,550
Another example of it,
when I speak Hebrew,

123
00:06:46,551 --> 00:06:47,384
I imagine the time I spent in Jerusalem 
because that's a very vivid time for me 

124
00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:55,040
so I can bring myself back to that time.
Imagine the environment.

125
00:06:55,050 --> 00:06:55,883
Imagine a certain situation I was in,
in that place where I can hear Hebrew 

126
00:06:59,631 --> 00:07:00,464
speakers and I see a different cultural 
things that remind me of the Hebrew 

127
00:07:04,401 --> 00:07:05,234
language and all of that.
So all of those things are associations 

128
00:07:07,161 --> 00:07:10,430
that bring me back into the zone when I 
was speaking Hebrew.

129
00:07:10,431 --> 00:07:12,870
Well,
all of these pieces of advice,

130
00:07:12,871 --> 00:07:16,580
that kind of abstract,
I wish I could be a bit more logical and

131
00:07:16,581 --> 00:07:17,414
scientific in the tips I'm giving,
but when we're dealing with we're 

132
00:07:21,681 --> 00:07:23,750
dealing with switching from one language
to another.

133
00:07:23,751 --> 00:07:24,584
We're we're dealing with switching into 
different states and that kind of 

134
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:30,830
requires you to take control of your 
perception,

135
00:07:31,130 --> 00:07:31,430
right?

136
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:32,263
It's not the same for everybody,
so if these tips don't really work for 

137
00:07:35,301 --> 00:07:37,280
you,
then you don't have to use them.

138
00:07:37,281 --> 00:07:38,114
Of course.
Just think about similar types of 

139
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:41,053
techniques and how you can control your 
perception in a way that will take you 

140
00:07:44,511 --> 00:07:48,170
into that zone where you are speaking 
the language well,

141
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,033
so a lot of it has to do with 
associations and connections with that 

142
00:07:51,891 --> 00:07:55,040
language.
Another thing I should point out is that

143
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:56,833
the language is that you haven't spoken 
recently are always going to fade a 

144
00:08:00,051 --> 00:08:02,120
little bit if you leave them in the 
background,

145
00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:04,670
right?
The ones that you can move into the most

146
00:08:04,671 --> 00:08:07,610
easily are the ones you have used most 
recently,

147
00:08:08,090 --> 00:08:08,923
so don't expect to use one of these 
techniques and be able to speak really 

148
00:08:13,491 --> 00:08:14,324
well and really,
really instantly in a language you 

149
00:08:16,401 --> 00:08:18,380
haven't spoken in five years,
uh,

150
00:08:18,410 --> 00:08:21,500
you might be able to with the basics of 
that language,

151
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:25,160
but you won't be at the level you were 
at five years ago obviously because you,

152
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:28,070
you start to lose some of the language 
gradually.

153
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:29,900
So just keep that in mind.
Uh,

154
00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:30,763
it's also a matter of just keeping the 
language fresh and keeping them a well 

155
00:08:34,121 --> 00:08:34,954
practiced.
You can't always do that with all of 

156
00:08:36,411 --> 00:08:37,880
them.
If you speak 10 languages,

157
00:08:37,881 --> 00:08:38,714
you can't speak all 10 every day,
so you will always have some that are 

158
00:08:42,051 --> 00:08:42,884
more ready to go than others.
And the others are more waiting in the 

159
00:08:45,411 --> 00:08:49,160
background for you to retrieve them and 
start to practice and,

160
00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:50,103
and brush up on those languages.
And then there'll be in the forefront 

161
00:08:54,231 --> 00:08:58,010
end ready to get into the zone again.
Alright.

162
00:08:58,020 --> 00:09:00,090
So that's all I've got to say about 
that.

163
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:02,160
Hope that's clear.
Talk to you later.
