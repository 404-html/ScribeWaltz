00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:05,303
I guess this is the part where I make a 
cliche joke about the language of 

2
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:09,053
romance.
You should pay him and you'll have a 

3
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:14,240
nice Maliki.
Mia Maslovian.

4
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:16,170
Okay.
Cut cliche.

5
00:00:16,171 --> 00:00:17,640
Joke over.
Finished.

00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:19,643
Hello everyone.
Welcome to the Lange Focus Channel and 

7
00:00:21,591 --> 00:00:22,424
my name is Paul.
Today I'm going to be talking about the 

8
00:00:24,691 --> 00:00:27,540
romance languages,
not the language of romance,

9
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:28,823
the romance languages.
Why should you care about the romance 

10
00:00:31,351 --> 00:00:32,220
languages?
Wealth?

11
00:00:32,230 --> 00:00:34,680
The most important romance languages are
French,

12
00:00:34,681 --> 00:00:36,000
Spanish,
Italian,

13
00:00:36,001 --> 00:00:37,500
Portuguese,
and Romanian.

14
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:41,220
They are some of the most widely spoken 
languages in Europe and some of them are

15
00:00:41,221 --> 00:00:46,221
spoken widely around the entire world.
There are 800 million native speakers of

16
00:00:46,291 --> 00:00:49,680
romance languages around the world.
That's why you should care.

17
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:50,543
They are a group of languages that 
belong to the Italax subfamily of the 

18
00:00:53,490 --> 00:00:54,323
Indo European language family.
It's Alec languages or languages 

19
00:00:57,420 --> 00:00:59,310
originating and what is now it's a 
illegal,

20
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:00,503
what is the captain.
