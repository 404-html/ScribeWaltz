Hello everyone,
welcome to the Lange Focus Channel and 

2
00:00:03,161 --> 00:00:03,994
my name is Paul.
Thank you for watching and have a nice 

3
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:12,120
day.
Mickey,

4
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:14,933
what?
What do you want?

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,430
What do you mean that's wrong?
I say that in every video.

6
00:00:24,290 --> 00:00:25,160
Oh,
right.

7
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:32,370
Cut.
[inaudible].

8
00:00:32,370 --> 00:00:33,203
Hello everyone.
Welcome to the Lange Focus Channel and 

9
00:00:35,281 --> 00:00:36,114
my name is Paul.
Today's topic is why does Portuguese 

10
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:40,960
sound like Russian?
Yeah.

11
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:43,363
Oh,
be quiet.

12
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:46,600
So why am I even asking that question?
Well,

13
00:00:46,610 --> 00:00:47,443
a lot of people hear Portuguese and it's
usually the Portuguese spoken in 

14
00:00:50,331 --> 00:00:51,164
Portugal rather than Brazil or elsewhere
and they think it sounds Russian or 

15
00:00:54,651 --> 00:00:57,560
Slavic Russian being a slavic language.
Of course,

16
00:00:57,740 --> 00:01:01,280
most of the people who say this are 
people who don't speak either language,

17
00:01:01,281 --> 00:01:04,940
but just think that something about 
Portuguese sounds Russian without really

18
00:01:04,941 --> 00:01:05,774
being able to describe why.
Now I'm sure that a lot of Portuguese 

19
00:01:08,721 --> 00:01:11,630
speakers and Russian speakers will say 
that that's ridiculous.

20
00:01:11,631 --> 00:01:12,464
They sound nothing alike,
but I've even heard native speakers of 

21
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:16,043
Russian say that they think Portuguese 
sounds Russian and I've heard native 

22
00:01:18,921 --> 00:01:23,090
speakers of Polish as well say that they
think Portuguese sounds like Polish.

23
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:27,290
Let me be clear that they are not saying
that Portuguese is mutually intelligible

24
00:01:27,291 --> 00:01:29,690
with Russia or with any other Slavic 
language.

25
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:30,613
It's not at all.
What they do say is that if they hear 

26
00:01:32,841 --> 00:01:33,674
Portuguese being spoken at a distance 
but they aren't close enough to hear 

27
00:01:36,351 --> 00:01:37,184
what's being said,
or if they're not really paying 

28
00:01:38,481 --> 00:01:39,314
attention to what's being said,
then they think it sounds like Russian 

29
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:44,660
or Polish,
and I've heard the same thing in reverse

30
00:01:44,661 --> 00:01:45,494
from European speakers of Portuguese.
If they hear Russian or another Slavic 

31
00:01:48,591 --> 00:01:49,424
language from a distance,
they might think that it sounds like 

32
00:01:51,171 --> 00:01:53,240
Portuguese,
so how can that happen?

33
00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:55,880
Well,
it's because of some similar elements in

34
00:01:55,881 --> 00:01:56,714
there.
Phonology,

35
00:01:57,140 --> 00:01:58,670
stress,
timed languages.

36
00:01:58,760 --> 00:01:59,593
One important similarity between 
Portuguese and Russian is that both of 

37
00:02:02,631 --> 00:02:06,380
them are stressed timed languages in a 
stress timed language,

38
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:07,333
the length of time between stressed 
syllables remains relatively consistent 

39
00:02:10,790 --> 00:02:13,490
and in order to fit into that fixed time
interval,

40
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:16,330
unstressed syllables become compressed 
and shortened.

41
00:02:16,850 --> 00:02:19,100
This results in a lot of vowel 
reduction.

42
00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:23,930
European Portuguese contains quite an 
extreme amount of vowel reduction.

43
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:25,920
For example,
done form.

44
00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:27,163
This means I'm hungry.
You can see that the sounds old is 

45
00:02:29,511 --> 00:02:34,511
reduced or a Schwab and the sound is 
reduced form.

46
00:02:35,210 --> 00:02:37,940
Another example,
important again,

47
00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:38,803
the old is reduced and a is reduced to 
or basically disappears important and 

48
00:02:45,561 --> 00:02:48,200
there's similarly a lot of vowel 
reduction in Russian.

49
00:02:48,410 --> 00:02:49,690
For example,
Uber.

50
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:51,860
Look,
this word means cloud.

51
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:56,450
The off is reduced to a Schwab and old 
is also reduced to a Schwab.

52
00:02:57,740 --> 00:02:59,530
Another example,
subpart d,

53
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:03,520
this word means boots.
You've probably noticed the reduction in

54
00:03:03,521 --> 00:03:05,500
these two vowels right here,
so buggy,

55
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:06,753
Russian and other Slavic languages also 
have a lot of consonant clusters and 

56
00:03:10,151 --> 00:03:13,120
because of the heavy vowel reduction in 
European Portuguese,

57
00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:16,660
it ends up having more consonant 
clusters than other romance languages.

58
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:18,160
Here's a Portuguese example.

59
00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:20,523
This means to despise.
This is a consonant cluster with four 

60
00:03:23,411 --> 00:03:24,244
consonants which results from the 
dropping of the evil app for consonants 

61
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:31,660
is an extreme example,
and three is more common,

62
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:36,700
and here's a Russian example split.
This means splash.

63
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:37,653
This cluster also has four consonants,
split risk in addition to the vowel 

64
00:03:42,101 --> 00:03:42,934
reduction,
the stress timing results in a similar 

65
00:03:44,711 --> 00:03:45,544
rhythm,
a similar cadence in contrast with 

66
00:03:48,491 --> 00:03:49,324
stress times languages,
there are also syllable timed languages 

67
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,193
in syllable timed languages.
Each syllable lasts for a more or less 

68
00:03:55,990 --> 00:03:56,823
equal duration of time.
Other romance languages are much more 

69
00:03:59,501 --> 00:04:03,460
syllable time to then Portuguese,
which gives it its different cadence and

70
00:04:03,461 --> 00:04:04,294
it's vowel reduction.
It's interesting to note that Brazilian 

71
00:04:06,461 --> 00:04:07,294
Portuguese,
which has weaker stress timing than 

72
00:04:08,921 --> 00:04:09,754
European.
Portuguese is often said to sound more 

73
00:04:11,651 --> 00:04:14,020
like Spanish than European.
Portuguese does,

74
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:17,740
but there are lots of stress timed 
languages including English,

75
00:04:17,770 --> 00:04:20,890
and I don't hear anybody saying that 
Portuguese sounds like English,

76
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,570
so there must be more to it than that.

77
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:23,823
Sibilance.
One feature of Russian is that sibilant 

78
00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:27,123
sounds are quite prominent.
Sibilance are continents that have a 

79
00:04:29,771 --> 00:04:33,070
hissing or hushing sound as in the 
English sibilants,

80
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:35,520
SA,
chef Joe,

81
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:37,050
Joe,
Joe.

82
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:40,730
Russian features these sibilants,
sa,

83
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:44,340
Zap,
chop shop,

84
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:47,013
and Portuguese features.
These four sa Za Shock Jock Portuguese 

85
00:04:52,121 --> 00:04:52,954
contains frequent sibilance and 
specifically has an abundance of Palo 

86
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:59,770
Alto Alveolar sibilants show,
which is voiceless and Asia,

87
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:04,810
which has voiced orthographic,
s and z are rendered as shook and joe in

88
00:05:04,811 --> 00:05:08,680
some contexts before a voiceless 
consonant or before a pause.

89
00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:11,380
Sibilance are pronounced shift.
For example,

90
00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:12,363
see Dutch meaning cities,
las meaning happy in the plural form 

91
00:05:17,170 --> 00:05:18,040
fresh,
Trish.

92
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:20,610
This means makes three.
It'll.

93
00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:23,440
This means they,
in this example,

94
00:05:23,441 --> 00:05:28,270
the s becomes at the end of the word and
also notice that the reduced vowel,

95
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,193
a fully dropped vowel actually results 
in a consonant cluster ending in ship 

96
00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:36,910
before I voiced consonant Asia,
for example,

97
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:39,273
meaning fortunately it's also worth 
noting that the letter j and also ge 

98
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:47,230
when it's pronounced as a soft g,
are also pronounced measure.

99
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:48,903
These two Russian sibilance and she have
similar sounds to Portuguese shot and 

100
00:05:55,511 --> 00:05:59,510
this Russian sibilant draw is similar to
Portuguese,

101
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:00,393
just they're not exactly the same.
The Portuguese ones are post Alveolar 

102
00:06:03,921 --> 00:06:04,754
sibilants while these Russian,
once our retroflex sibilance with a 

103
00:06:07,731 --> 00:06:09,680
slightly different place of 
articulation,

104
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:12,830
and this one here is an lv Leo Palatal 
sibilant.

105
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:16,100
This sound is also slightly different 
from the Portuguese one,

106
00:06:16,130 --> 00:06:16,963
but it sounds somewhat similar,
at least two people who don't use that 

107
00:06:19,191 --> 00:06:20,024
sound natively a moment to go.
We saw a type of consonant assimilation 

108
00:06:23,901 --> 00:06:24,734
in Portuguese that makes the sibilant 
either voiced or voiceless depending on 

109
00:06:28,071 --> 00:06:28,904
what follows in Russian.
There's a similar type of assimilation 

110
00:06:32,421 --> 00:06:33,254
for most consonants voiced.
Consonants are pronounced as voiceless 

111
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:37,093
at the end of a word or before another 
voiceless consonant and voiceless 

112
00:06:40,311 --> 00:06:43,590
consonants are pronounced as voiced 
before a voiced consonants,

113
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:46,880
for example,
in this word,

114
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:53,110
becomes voiceless and is pronounced as 
look in this word becomes voiceless,

115
00:06:55,400 --> 00:07:00,400
and as pronounced as to zone in this 
word becomes voiced and as pronounced as

116
00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:02,683
good,
so the frequent voiceless sibilant ship 

117
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:09,500
at the end of words in Portuguese,
as well as the assimilation of sibilance

118
00:07:09,501 --> 00:07:10,334
to the following consonant,
making them either voiceless or voiced 

119
00:07:13,371 --> 00:07:18,290
measure might unconsciously remind us of
the similar but more generalized pattern

120
00:07:18,291 --> 00:07:19,124
in Russian.

121
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:23,600
That same pattern is also a feature of 
Polish and most other Slavic languages.

122
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:25,820
With Ukrainian being a notable 
exception,

123
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:27,913
palatalized consonants.
One prominent feature of Russian is a 

124
00:07:30,861 --> 00:07:34,430
distinction between hard consonants and 
soft consonants,

125
00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:35,323
which our palatalized they sound 
somewhat like the consonant with a yoke 

126
00:07:38,210 --> 00:07:41,840
sound immediately following Portuguese 
features too.

127
00:07:41,841 --> 00:07:42,674
Palatal consonants.
The characters in h represent a palatal 

128
00:07:47,691 --> 00:07:49,160
nasal,
for example,

129
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:50,803
which we saw before.
A similar sound appears in Russian as 

130
00:07:53,601 --> 00:07:56,090
one of the soft consonants,
for example,

131
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:01,110
who stand yet meaning eliminate and in 
Portuguese the letters l,

132
00:08:01,111 --> 00:08:04,880
h stand for a palatal lateral 
approximate,

133
00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:07,550
for example,
could our volume again,

134
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:10,250
there's a soft consonant in Russian that
sounds similar.

135
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:11,533
For example,
these two palatal consonants alone are 

136
00:08:15,351 --> 00:08:17,660
not enough to make Portuguese sounds 
Slavic.

137
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:21,170
After all the sounds do appearance,
some other romance languages too,

138
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:22,153
but together with the other elements,
this is one thing that contributes to 

139
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:27,110
the overall slavic sound of Portuguese.

140
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:28,903
The dark l,
another phonetic feature that sounds 

141
00:08:31,311 --> 00:08:34,580
Slavic is the villa rised,
l of European Portuguese.

142
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:39,130
This is like the dark l sound at the end
of the word field.

143
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:40,093
Oh,
the standard elo sound in Russian is 

144
00:08:41,961 --> 00:08:45,200
also a dark l like this.
Here's a Portuguese example.

145
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:50,440
I'll meaning high in a tall meaning 
Christmas and the Russian example,

146
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:55,950
balut meaning to swim,
Luke meaning bowl or onion,

147
00:08:56,430 --> 00:08:57,263
nasal vowels and diphthongs.
I mentioned before that some people 

148
00:08:59,971 --> 00:09:00,804
think that Portuguese sounds like Polish
Slavic language and all of the features 

149
00:09:04,651 --> 00:09:07,590
that I mentioned about Russian also 
applies to polish,

150
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:11,400
but Polish has one other feature in 
common with Portuguese that Russian does

151
00:09:11,401 --> 00:09:14,580
not.
Nasal vowels in old slavonic,

152
00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:17,550
there were nasal vowels,
but in modern Slavic languages,

153
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:20,820
they have merged with oral vowels except
for in Polish.

154
00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:25,320
In Portuguese there are a number of 
nasal vowels and nasal diphthongs,

155
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:27,600
and in Polish there are two nasal 
vowels.

156
00:09:27,810 --> 00:09:28,643
This letter is pronounced own,
which sounds close to the Portuguese 

157
00:09:32,011 --> 00:09:35,280
nasal diphthong own,
and there's one more.

158
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:37,830
Oh,
this is the nasal e sound,

159
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:38,903
because Polish nasal vowels consist of 
an oral vowel followed by a nasal semi 

160
00:09:42,731 --> 00:09:43,564
vowel.
They sound somewhat like nasal 

161
00:09:44,761 --> 00:09:47,070
diphthongs,
of which Portuguese has several.

162
00:09:47,310 --> 00:09:50,280
Here's a Polish example,
meaning snake,

163
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:53,460
and here's a Portuguese example with a 
similar nasal vowel.

164
00:09:54,590 --> 00:09:57,860
Here's another Polish example,
meaning snakes,

165
00:09:58,100 --> 00:09:59,570
and here's a Portuguese example.

166
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:06,510
So even though a Portuguese is not 
closely related to Russian Polish or any

167
00:10:06,511 --> 00:10:07,344
other Slavic language,
they just belong to language families 

168
00:10:09,601 --> 00:10:12,030
within the wider Indo European language 
family.

169
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:12,933
That's their only connection.
They do share a number of phonological 

170
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:16,553
features that make them sound 
superficially similar to the untrained 

171
00:10:19,741 --> 00:10:20,574
ear,
especially from a distance or when 

172
00:10:21,931 --> 00:10:24,120
you're not paying attention to what's 
being said.

173
00:10:24,570 --> 00:10:27,120
It's not really a big deal in the grand 
scheme of things,

174
00:10:27,121 --> 00:10:27,954
but it raises an interesting question.
What are those features that stand out 

175
00:10:30,721 --> 00:10:34,920
to us and make us think that they sound 
similar largely on an unconscious level?

176
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:36,083
The question of the day to speakers of 
Portuguese and two speakers of Russian 

177
00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:40,463
Polish and other Slavic languages.
Have you ever had the impression that 

178
00:10:42,691 --> 00:10:43,524
Portuguese sounds Slavic?
What sounds are features might have 

179
00:10:45,841 --> 00:10:48,240
given you that impression and to other 
people?

180
00:10:48,270 --> 00:10:51,600
Does Portuguese sound Russian to you or 
sounds Slavic to you?

181
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:55,110
You may not consciously know what 
Russian or slavic sounds like,

182
00:10:55,170 --> 00:10:58,410
but you probably associate them with 
certain sounds unconsciously.
