00:00:01,410 --> 00:00:02,243

Hello everyone.
Welcome to the Lange Focus Channel and 

3
00:00:06,951 --> 00:00:10,850
my name is Paul.
How did Greek influence English?

4
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:14,210
That is the question.
As I mentioned in my recent video on the

5
00:00:14,211 --> 00:00:15,044
Greek language,
Greek is a language that has influenced 

6
00:00:17,031 --> 00:00:17,864
many others including English.
The most remarkable way that Greek has 

7
00:00:20,810 --> 00:00:23,000
influenced English isn't it's 
vocabulary.

8
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:23,893
In my previous video,
I briefly mentioned that around six 

9
00:00:26,181 --> 00:00:29,270
percent of the vocabulary of English is 
of Greek origin,

10
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:32,930
but that some estimates reach as high as
12 or 15 percent.

11
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:36,650
This depends on how you measure it.
You can measure type frequency,

12
00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:37,543
the percentage of the total number of 
words with no regard for how often 

13
00:00:40,341 --> 00:00:43,220
they're used or you can measure a token 
frequency,

14
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:46,490
meaning the proportion of words in a 
given speech or text,

15
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:50,060
so words that are more frequently used 
account for a larger proportion.

16
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:51,673
There's a huge number of words of Greek 
origin that are used in specialized 

17
00:00:54,531 --> 00:00:56,240
areas of the sciences,
medicine,

18
00:00:56,241 --> 00:00:59,750
and technology that aren't used very 
often in regular speech.

19
00:00:59,930 --> 00:01:00,763
So if we measure type frequency,
the percentage of Greek words will be 

20
00:01:03,561 --> 00:01:06,590
higher because less common words are 
given equal weight.

21
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:07,693
If we measure a token frequency,
the percentage will be lower because 

22
00:01:10,311 --> 00:01:14,510
less common words are counted less.
I believe that the figure of six percent

23
00:01:14,511 --> 00:01:15,344
is based on token frequency and the 
higher figures are based on type 

24
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:18,813
frequency.
Some Greek words were borrowed directly 

25
00:01:20,781 --> 00:01:24,080
from Greek into English.
Some of these were borrowed early in the

26
00:01:24,081 --> 00:01:27,920
history of English like church from the 
Greek word [inaudible],

27
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:29,353
which entered old English as cute chick 
and some were borrowed later in the 

28
00:01:33,050 --> 00:01:35,180
early modern English period.
For example,

29
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:36,073
autonomy.
This word entered English directly from 

30
00:01:37,941 --> 00:01:41,450
ancient Greek out to nomia in the 16 
twenties,

31
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:45,710
but a larger number of Greek words 
entered English indirectly through Latin

32
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:48,260
or through Latin than French.
For example,

33
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:49,153
museum.
This comes from the Latin word 

34
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:53,450
[inaudible],
meaning library or study,

35
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:56,630
and that comes from the ancient Greek 
word Moose sale,

36
00:01:56,930 --> 00:01:59,000
which meant place of study,
library,

37
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:01,520
museum,
or school of art or poetry.

38
00:02:01,910 --> 00:02:02,743
And if we go back even further to the 
original meaning of the ancient Greek 

39
00:02:05,571 --> 00:02:06,404
word,
it meant the seat or shrine of the 

40
00:02:08,001 --> 00:02:08,834
muses.
The nine muses were the daughters of 

41
00:02:10,491 --> 00:02:11,324
Zeus in the Masani.
They were goddesses who symbolized the 

42
00:02:13,671 --> 00:02:16,100
arts and sciences.
Another example,

43
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:20,190
the word olive entered the English 
language around the twelfth century ce,

44
00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:25,330
either from old French bullies or 
directly from Latin Oliva or Oliva,

45
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:28,670
which in turn comes from the Greek word 
a lie.

46
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:32,240
Well,
the word chaos comes from the Greek word

47
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,153
cows and entered English in the 14th 
century via Latin than French 

48
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:42,820
catastrophe entered English and the 15 
thirties from Latin catastrophe from the

49
00:02:43,101 --> 00:02:43,934
Greek word catastrophe,
which was originally pronounced as 

50
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:50,510
cholesterol pay,
meaning and overturning or a sudden end.

51
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:54,260
The word democracy entered English in 
the 15 seventies.

52
00:02:54,410 --> 00:02:55,243
It came from the middle French word.
They mccloskey which in turn came from 

53
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:01,840
medieval Latin Democrat,
which came from ancient Greek.

54
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:06,550
The word paragraph entered English in 
the late 14,

55
00:03:06,551 --> 00:03:07,384
hundreds via medieval Latin and French,
and it comes from the Greek word 

56
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:11,873
[inaudible],
which was originally pronounced as 

57
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:14,633
paddock it.
I pause and there are many more words 

58
00:03:16,811 --> 00:03:17,644
like this,
the largest number of Greek words to 

59
00:03:19,481 --> 00:03:22,090
enter English.
We're actually newly created words.

60
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:24,760
They were newly created using Greek 
morphemes,

61
00:03:24,761 --> 00:03:27,940
but they're words that hadn't existed in
Greek before that point.

62
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:31,000
And then those words were borrowed from 
Latin into English.

63
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:33,280
Some are formed from only Greek 
morphemes,

64
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:35,110
for example,
photography.

65
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:39,770
This word was created in 1834 by 
combining photo,

66
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:44,470
which meant lights in ancient Greek and 
the ancient Greek suffix graffel meaning

67
00:03:44,471 --> 00:03:47,320
to scratch or to scrape,
but later meaning to right.

68
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:50,980
And if you're wondering how those 
different meanings are related to scrape

69
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:51,903
and to write well,
think about how people used to write 

70
00:03:53,951 --> 00:03:54,784
thousands of years ago.
They used to scrape letters into stone 

71
00:03:56,921 --> 00:03:57,754
tablets.

72
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:00,640
Another word,
xenophobia or xenophobia.

73
00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:04,060
This word was created in 19 Oh,
three from the Greek root,

74
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:08,350
phenols meaning alien and phobia,
meaning fear.

75
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:10,053
Other words were formed from a 
combination of both Greek and Latin 

76
00:04:12,521 --> 00:04:13,960
morphemes.
For example,

77
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:14,823
television.
This word was created from the Greek 

78
00:04:16,421 --> 00:04:19,270
morpheme t lay meaning far or at a 
distance.

79
00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:22,390
And the French word,
Vco meaning site.

80
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:25,480
This word entered English via French.
Another example,

81
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:26,463
automobile.
The first part comes from ancient Greek 

82
00:04:28,730 --> 00:04:30,520
autos,
meaning self.

83
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:33,260
And the second part comes from the 
French word [inaudible],

84
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:35,950
which means moving,
which came from Latin moby.

85
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:40,600
These movable sociology.
The first part comes from the Latin word

86
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:42,490
Celsius,
meaning comrade,

87
00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:45,640
and the second part comes from the Greek
morpheme loggia,

88
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:46,773
meaning discourse.
Now just have a look at them morphemes 

89
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,073
that are highlighted.
You've probably seen many more words 

90
00:04:52,091 --> 00:04:52,924
that feature these same Greek morphemes.
There are lots of common Greek roots in 

91
00:04:56,711 --> 00:04:57,940
English,
for example,

92
00:04:58,030 --> 00:05:00,790
and throat meaning man,
crone or Chron,

93
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:04,870
meaning time them meaning people,
head meaning child.

94
00:05:05,410 --> 00:05:06,243
There are also many Greek affixes app or
an meaning without by or bio meaning 

95
00:05:11,051 --> 00:05:11,884
life or living thing,
hyper meaning excessive micro meaning 

96
00:05:15,191 --> 00:05:20,191
small geo meaning earth or geography,
anti meaning against it,

97
00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:23,140
a suffix that forms adjectives and many 
more.

98
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:28,150
A huge number of these newly coined 
words exist in areas of academia,

99
00:05:28,151 --> 00:05:29,320
medicine,
science,

100
00:05:29,321 --> 00:05:30,154
and technology because the huge 
advancements in these areas over the 

101
00:05:32,831 --> 00:05:33,664
past 500 years required the creation of 
lots of new vocabulary in the field of 

102
00:05:37,661 --> 00:05:38,830
medicine.
For example,

103
00:05:39,010 --> 00:05:40,620
Latin words,
both old and new,

104
00:05:40,621 --> 00:05:43,420
newly coined ones were often used for 
anatomy.

105
00:05:43,570 --> 00:05:47,200
While Greek words were used for the 
names of illnesses or specializations.

106
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:52,810
A lot of these specialized words are not
used in daily conversation very often,

107
00:05:52,811 --> 00:05:53,644
but without them it will be very 
difficult to talk about these advanced 

108
00:05:56,081 --> 00:05:56,914
fields of study.
It's also worth noting that these words 

109
00:05:58,911 --> 00:06:00,560
are not exclusive to English.

110
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,393
A lot of them are used in other 
languages as well when talking about 

111
00:06:03,741 --> 00:06:04,574
those fields of study.
Here are a couple of hints on how to 

112
00:06:06,561 --> 00:06:10,460
recognize Greek vocabulary.
Most words starting with Ph are Greek.

113
00:06:11,570 --> 00:06:12,403
Some vowels,
spellings give us a hint like aee or 

114
00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:15,620
oee.
Together,

115
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:20,240
if you see a wide between consonants,
it's likely a Greek word.

116
00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:23,780
If a word starts with any of these 
consonant clusters,

117
00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:26,090
then it's almost certainly a word of 
Greek origin.

118
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:27,643
Some of these clusters can't be 
pronounced in English like ps or pen or 

119
00:06:31,221 --> 00:06:32,054
Gen.
so the first letter is dropped in 

120
00:06:33,381 --> 00:06:34,214
pronunciation.
An interesting example back in the 19 

121
00:06:37,221 --> 00:06:39,080
fifties,
professor sandol phones,

122
00:06:39,090 --> 00:06:39,923
the Lotus,
a Greek economist and the 75th prime 

123
00:06:42,441 --> 00:06:43,274
minister of Greece gave two speeches in 
which she addressed the audience in 

124
00:06:46,101 --> 00:06:46,934
English,
but using exclusively words of Greek 

125
00:06:48,771 --> 00:06:51,740
origin with the exception of grammar,
words like articles,

126
00:06:51,741 --> 00:06:53,390
prepositions and conjunctions.

127
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,313
All of the content where it's wearing 
Greek here is a piece of one of those 

128
00:06:56,901 --> 00:06:57,734
speeches which he gave to the 
International Bank for Reconstruction 

129
00:07:00,321 --> 00:07:01,154
and development.
It is Zeus and that's them up on our 

130
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:03,853
epoch for the dynamism of our economies 
and the heresy of our economic methods 

131
00:07:07,671 --> 00:07:08,504
and policies that we should agonize 
between the seller of numismatic 

132
00:07:13,050 --> 00:07:14,330
plethora and the curb dis of economic 
anemia.

133
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:18,290
It is not my idiosyncrasy to be ironic 
or sarcastic,

134
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:19,153
but my diagnosis would be that 
politicians are rather crypto plethora 

135
00:07:22,181 --> 00:07:23,014
wrists,
although they emphatically stigmatized 

136
00:07:24,651 --> 00:07:25,484
numismatic plethora,
energize it through their tactics and 

137
00:07:27,621 --> 00:07:28,454
practices.
Our policies have to be based more on 

138
00:07:30,441 --> 00:07:33,140
economic and less on political criteria.
Now,

139
00:07:33,141 --> 00:07:37,340
let's break that down a little bit.
The first part it is Zeus is anathema on

140
00:07:37,341 --> 00:07:38,174
our epoch.
This means it is [inaudible] curse or a 

141
00:07:40,541 --> 00:07:44,570
punishment on our time or era.
In a typical English sentence,

142
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:47,990
you might expect to see God in this 
context instead of Zeus,

143
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:49,153
for the dynamism of our economies and 
the heresy of our economic methods and 

144
00:07:52,461 --> 00:07:53,150
policies.

145
00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:55,400
Here,
he's saying that Zeus is punishment,

146
00:07:55,460 --> 00:08:00,460
is for the uncontrolled activity of our 
economies and our economic heresy,

147
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:03,950
meaning violating,
accepted economic ideas,

148
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:05,083
and next he'll explain what the 
punishment is that we should agonize 

149
00:08:07,911 --> 00:08:08,744
between the seller of numismatic 
plethora and the coverup this of 

150
00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:14,480
economic anemia.
Now these two words here,

151
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:17,990
Scylla and Charybdis,
these are actually characters from Greek

152
00:08:17,991 --> 00:08:20,780
mythology.
They are to mythical sea monsters,

153
00:08:20,930 --> 00:08:25,100
too dangerous monsters that it's 
difficult to navigate between because if

154
00:08:25,101 --> 00:08:27,770
you move away from one,
you move toward the other.

155
00:08:28,330 --> 00:08:31,430
Their names here are indicating to 
dangerous situations,

156
00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:35,390
so the first of those two dangerous 
situations is numismatic plethora.

157
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:40,540
Numismatic means related to coins or 
currency and plethora means abundance or

158
00:08:41,030 --> 00:08:44,510
a lot of these two words together,
me and inflation,

159
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:47,210
meaning there's too much currency in 
circulation,

160
00:08:47,211 --> 00:08:50,450
so prices increase.
And the second dangerous situation,

161
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:53,420
the curb,
this is economic anemia.

162
00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:56,640
Anemia meaning stagnation or loss of 
energy.

163
00:08:57,420 --> 00:09:00,120
Most of the second part is probably 
easier to understand,

164
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,073
but let's look at one part,
but my diagnosis would be that 

165
00:09:03,601 --> 00:09:06,360
politicians are rather crypto plethora,
wrists.

166
00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:10,880
Now this word requires a look.
Crypto means secret and plethora.

167
00:09:10,881 --> 00:09:13,050
Wrists,
remember that word before Plethora,

168
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:16,440
which means abundance or a lot of,
and then it's.

169
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:19,050
That's an affix showing the dewar of an 
action.

170
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,153
So Plethora.
Wrists are people who create an 

171
00:09:21,841 --> 00:09:24,120
abundance of money.
They create inflation,

172
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:28,080
although they emphatically stigmatize 
numismatic plethora,

173
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:30,330
although they speak badly about 
inflation,

174
00:09:30,810 --> 00:09:33,390
they energize it through their tactics 
and practices.

175
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:37,560
He's saying that politicians are 
secretly creating inflation despite what

176
00:09:37,561 --> 00:09:39,600
they say.
That's just an excerpt,

177
00:09:39,601 --> 00:09:40,434
but I'll leave a link to the full 
version of the two speeches in the 

178
00:09:42,571 --> 00:09:44,340
description below.
Now,

179
00:09:44,341 --> 00:09:45,174
the irony of me describing that speech 
in standard English is that I've 

180
00:09:47,851 --> 00:09:51,810
probably used a lot of words of Greek 
origin myself without realizing it.

181
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:52,793
So the question of the day,
were you surprised to discover how much 

182
00:09:55,171 --> 00:09:56,004
English vocabulary comes from Greek?
Were you surprised by any of the 

183
00:09:58,831 --> 00:10:00,180
examples?
Also,

184
00:10:00,181 --> 00:10:03,450
feel free to leave additional examples 
in the comments down below.

185
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:05,760
Be sure to follow Lang,
focus on facebook,

186
00:10:05,761 --> 00:10:07,200
twitter,

187
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:08,093
and once again,
thank you to all of my amazing patrion
