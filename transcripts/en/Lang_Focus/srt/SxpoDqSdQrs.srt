00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,610
Hello everyone.
Welcome to the Lange focus channel.

2
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:03,473
My name is Paul.
Today I'm going to be talking about a 

3
00:00:05,761 --> 00:00:06,594
language learning tool called memorize.
I tend to be a traditional kind of 

4
00:00:10,141 --> 00:00:10,974
learner.
I focus on using textbooks on audio 

5
00:00:13,171 --> 00:00:16,050
listening materials are not 
communicating with native speakers.

6
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:18,840
Those are the staples of my typical 
study routine,

7
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:22,080
but a lot of people ask me about things 
like memorize.

8
00:00:22,081 --> 00:00:22,914
So I decided to give,
memorize a try and give you my review 

9
00:00:26,101 --> 00:00:28,260
and tell you my impression.
So first of all,

10
00:00:28,261 --> 00:00:29,820
what is memorize?
Well,

11
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:30,743
memorize is a language learning platform
that's available on your desktop 

12
00:00:33,931 --> 00:00:34,764
computer or on your smartphone.
And it is basically a system for 

13
00:00:37,861 --> 00:00:41,970
memorizing using flashcards with a 
spaced repetition system.

14
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:45,780
So it's similar to something like 
[inaudible] in which you use a flashcard

15
00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:49,500
and to learn a word and then you review 
it at graduated intervals.

16
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:52,860
Those intervals get longer each time you
review the word,

17
00:00:52,861 --> 00:00:55,770
so maybe the first time you review it 
two minutes later,

18
00:00:55,830 --> 00:00:58,350
but then after that the next review 
comes 10 minutes later,

19
00:00:58,351 --> 00:01:00,960
the next one comes 30 minutes later,
that kind of thing.

20
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:01,913
So you're increasing the interval 
between the reviews of the flashcard 

21
00:01:04,740 --> 00:01:05,573
each time.
That's what I mean by a spaced 

22
00:01:07,051 --> 00:01:11,130
repetition system memorizes used 
primarily for language learning,

23
00:01:11,131 --> 00:01:15,480
but you can use it for other kinds of 
information to like geography or biology

24
00:01:15,481 --> 00:01:17,970
or whatever information you could put on
flashcards.

25
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:21,090
You can make flashcards and use them in 
the memorized system.

26
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:24,150
One of the pillars of the memorize 
approach is science.

27
00:01:24,151 --> 00:01:24,984
They claim to have a lot of legitimate 
science behind their approach behind 

28
00:01:27,991 --> 00:01:28,824
their technology with one of the 
founders of memorize being a 

29
00:01:31,081 --> 00:01:35,870
neuroscientist and the other one being 
an award winning master of memory,

30
00:01:35,871 --> 00:01:38,280
someone who's won a lot of memory 
contests,

31
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:39,143
that kind of thing.

32
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:43,770
The science of memorize focuses on two 
things in coding and testing.

33
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:44,783
So the first thing that memorize is 
focused on is encoding new information 

34
00:01:48,061 --> 00:01:48,894
into your memory.
And that is done by using something 

35
00:01:50,941 --> 00:01:51,774
called memes.
What memes are is they are kind of 

36
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:58,320
multimedia bits of information that can 
help you connect to that new information

37
00:01:58,321 --> 00:02:01,620
to something you already know.
So it could be an image.

38
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:06,030
So you're associating that new phrase or
a word with an image that is familiar to

39
00:02:06,031 --> 00:02:06,864
you.
It could be a funny sentence or a 

40
00:02:08,521 --> 00:02:10,320
shocking sentence,
something like that.

41
00:02:10,321 --> 00:02:11,154
It could be a mnemonic device.
Any of these kinds of things that can 

42
00:02:13,921 --> 00:02:14,754
help you connect that new information,
make some connections and retrieve that 

43
00:02:17,881 --> 00:02:20,850
memory later.
Those can be used as memes.

44
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:26,010
If you're an experienced language 
learners,

45
00:02:26,011 --> 00:02:26,844
and you might be good at coming up with 
memes of your own off the top of your 

46
00:02:29,371 --> 00:02:30,600
head,
but if you're not,

47
00:02:30,601 --> 00:02:31,434
or if you just need extra ideas,
then you get these memes within the 

48
00:02:34,201 --> 00:02:36,360
memorize system that are provided for 
you.

49
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:41,250
So those memes are for the purpose of 
encoding new information into memory.

50
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:45,540
The second scientific principle that 
memorize this,

51
00:02:45,541 --> 00:02:46,374
focused on his testing.
So after you have encoded that new 

52
00:02:48,451 --> 00:02:51,720
information as a memory,
then the next thing is to test yourself.

53
00:02:51,721 --> 00:02:52,554
That is to prompt yourself to recall 
that information later on before you 

54
00:02:56,041 --> 00:02:58,470
forget it.
And when you do recall that information,

55
00:02:58,471 --> 00:03:01,810
that strengthens the memory.
Okay,

56
00:03:01,811 --> 00:03:02,644
next I'll talk about the content.
And by that I mean the courses and the 

57
00:03:05,531 --> 00:03:08,920
flashcards that you can learn from 
inside the memorized system.

58
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:10,053
Memorize content is organized into 
courses and each of those courses 

59
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:14,613
consists of a bunch of flashcards and 
those courses are created by memrise 

60
00:03:17,981 --> 00:03:18,370
users.

61
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:21,670
They're not created by the founders of 
memorize or their employees,

62
00:03:21,671 --> 00:03:24,430
the created by you,
the people who use memorize.

63
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:25,413
So anyone who has the desktop version of
memorize can create a course anytime 

64
00:03:28,331 --> 00:03:29,164
they want.
And that means that there's a huge 

65
00:03:30,251 --> 00:03:34,300
variety of courses available.
There are tons of courses on memorize.

66
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:38,170
Okay,
so I'm going to talk about the positives

67
00:03:38,171 --> 00:03:39,004
and the negatives of memorize.
And then after that I'll give you my 

68
00:03:41,021 --> 00:03:44,530
final thoughts in summary on this tool 
for language learning.

69
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:45,543
So the positives,
number one is just the sheer number of 

70
00:03:47,771 --> 00:03:48,604
courses available.
The amount of content on memorize is 

71
00:03:51,161 --> 00:03:51,994
staggering.
If you look at the courses available at 

72
00:03:53,951 --> 00:03:54,784
the languages available,
there's just tons and tons to choose 

73
00:03:56,711 --> 00:03:57,544
from.
So it's like being a kid in a candy 

74
00:03:59,231 --> 00:04:00,064
store.
It's really a lot of fun just to browse 

75
00:04:01,331 --> 00:04:04,060
through there and think about what 
course do you want to try next.

76
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:06,310
So let's take a look at the selection 
inside.

77
00:04:06,311 --> 00:04:09,280
Memorize plumps.
Here we are on the memorize homepage,

78
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:11,860
and if I click on the courses button 
over here,

79
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:14,890
we'll see some of the featured courses 
on the front page.

80
00:04:14,891 --> 00:04:17,640
So we have learned basic Russian learn,
basic Brazilian,

81
00:04:17,650 --> 00:04:18,483
that et Cetera.
So at least ones are particularly 

82
00:04:19,841 --> 00:04:22,270
popular.
So they are featured on the front page,

83
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:24,940
but these are not the only language 
courses available.

84
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:27,880
Let's look at the left hand sidebar and 
see some of the others.

85
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:30,370
So this is,
these are the top categories,

86
00:04:30,371 --> 00:04:34,450
the most popular languages,
but look down below that and we can look

87
00:04:34,451 --> 00:04:37,330
at all categories.
So you see there are some other subjects

88
00:04:37,331 --> 00:04:39,670
like Trivia and memory training,
history,

89
00:04:39,671 --> 00:04:40,504
geography.
But let's look at languages looked at 

90
00:04:42,671 --> 00:04:43,504
that.
We've got all languages or language is 

91
00:04:46,361 --> 00:04:49,420
broken down into regions.
So let's click on for example,

92
00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:52,450
African and see how many languages there
are.

93
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:55,210
You can see there's a big long list of 
African languages,

94
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:56,790
Zulu,
Kosa,

95
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:58,810
Wallace,
Somali.

96
00:04:58,811 --> 00:05:02,470
There's all these languages.
Let's have a look up above at,

97
00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:04,360
let's see,
Asian and Pacific.

98
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:05,223
Let's see.
So a lot of the Asian languages are 

99
00:05:06,581 --> 00:05:07,420
here.
Indonesian,

100
00:05:07,421 --> 00:05:08,111
Korean,
Thai,

101
00:05:08,111 --> 00:05:11,080
Vietnamese.
So even I knew even the,

102
00:05:11,081 --> 00:05:15,840
I knew language from Japan,
which is a very endangered language even

103
00:05:16,170 --> 00:05:17,003
nowadays.
So there's a lot of languages that are 

104
00:05:18,341 --> 00:05:21,640
much less widely studied that courses 
are available for it.

105
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:22,773
Let's choose a language and click on it 
just to see the variety of courses that 

106
00:05:25,811 --> 00:05:28,150
you can get just for that one language.
So let's click,

107
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:31,630
let's not click the top one because that
would be too obvious.

108
00:05:31,631 --> 00:05:32,980
Let's click,
let's see,

109
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,710
how about Italian?
Let's go for that.

110
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:37,943
So we've got learn basic Italian,
I don't know exactly what it consists 

111
00:05:41,261 --> 00:05:42,094
of,
but it says learn Italian vocab and 

112
00:05:43,151 --> 00:05:44,170
grammar verbs,
phrases.

113
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:45,850
And down here,
let's see,

114
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:46,900
intermediate,
Italian,

115
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:49,450
Italian verbs and expressions,
introductory Italian,

116
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:54,010
the 500 most common Italian verbs,
hacking,

117
00:05:54,011 --> 00:05:54,940
Italian,
elementary,

118
00:05:54,941 --> 00:05:55,774
Italian.
So these are all different courses by 

119
00:05:57,501 --> 00:05:59,960
users.
Some of them might cover similar things,

120
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:02,360
so you probably don't want to do all of 
the courses,

121
00:06:02,361 --> 00:06:03,194
but there's a lot to choose from,
which is part of the fun of looking 

122
00:06:05,451 --> 00:06:06,284
around inside memorize,
so you don't have to start at the 

123
00:06:08,181 --> 00:06:11,000
beginning and follow a linear path with 
any kind.

124
00:06:11,001 --> 00:06:11,834
Of course,
you can jump around and skip around a 

125
00:06:13,101 --> 00:06:13,934
little bit.
You can do multiple courses at the same 

126
00:06:15,441 --> 00:06:16,790
time.
It's really up to you.

127
00:06:16,970 --> 00:06:19,160
It's nice to have that flexibility.
Okay.

128
00:06:19,161 --> 00:06:22,940
The second positive thing is that the 
system of encoding and testing,

129
00:06:22,941 --> 00:06:23,774
it's quite effective in my opinion.
I tried out some to gallows and French 

130
00:06:26,631 --> 00:06:27,464
courses,
but I also tried out a Turkish course 

131
00:06:29,091 --> 00:06:29,924
because Turkish is a language that I've 
never studied and I got a chance to see 

132
00:06:32,811 --> 00:06:36,260
how it feels to learn a language from 
scratch using memorize.

133
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:38,750
I didn't get really,
really far with that course.

134
00:06:38,751 --> 00:06:39,584
I just did a few lessons in it,
but I had a chance to see how well I 

135
00:06:42,861 --> 00:06:43,694
remembered things and I felt that I 
remembered the words quite well because 

136
00:06:47,450 --> 00:06:48,283
I was prompted to recall the words at 
times when I was just about to forget 

137
00:06:52,431 --> 00:06:53,264
them.
And that's actually really good in 

138
00:06:54,591 --> 00:06:55,424
spaced repetition and the goal is that 
you want to retrieve the word right 

139
00:06:58,911 --> 00:06:59,744
before you forget it because the more 
effort it takes to recall and retrieve 

140
00:07:02,451 --> 00:07:03,284
that word,
the the more you will strengthen that 

141
00:07:05,391 --> 00:07:06,224
memory.
So it felt like the memorize system had 

142
00:07:07,581 --> 00:07:11,960
really strategically timed when I needed
to review that word right on the edge of

143
00:07:11,961 --> 00:07:13,160
forgetting it,
which is good.

144
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:16,730
I also found the memes quite useful.
I'm an experienced language learner.

145
00:07:16,731 --> 00:07:18,770
I'm pretty good at coming up with my own
memes.

146
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:23,330
But having a bunch of crowdsourced memes
to choose from makes it just really easy

147
00:07:23,331 --> 00:07:24,164
and quick.
And sometimes you see one that really 

148
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:28,580
you connect with and you want to use 
more than your own,

149
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:31,070
and that just makes everything easier 
and smoother.

150
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:32,540
So so there,
why not?

151
00:07:32,541 --> 00:07:33,650
It's useful.
Okay.

152
00:07:33,651 --> 00:07:34,484
So now for a couple of negative things,
the first negative point is that 

153
00:07:37,641 --> 00:07:41,090
memorize is not really a comprehensive 
language learning system.

154
00:07:41,091 --> 00:07:44,870
It's basically a flashcard drilling 
system with spaced repetition.

155
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:49,220
So it's not something I would use to 
learn a language completely from scratch

156
00:07:49,221 --> 00:07:50,054
all by itself.
You don't really get any explanation 

157
00:07:52,221 --> 00:07:55,040
about the grammar or phonology or 
anything like that.

158
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:57,050
So sometimes when it's practicing with 
memorize,

159
00:07:57,051 --> 00:07:57,884
I would be looking at a word and 
thinking why are the letters pronounced 

160
00:08:00,141 --> 00:08:00,920
this way?
I would,

161
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:01,753
I really would like to have some 
explanation of the phonology or things 

162
00:08:04,191 --> 00:08:04,850
like that.

163
00:08:04,850 --> 00:08:05,683
But of course there is none.
So I'm pretty good at to do sing that 

164
00:08:08,511 --> 00:08:10,520
stuff from examples just from 
experience.

165
00:08:10,521 --> 00:08:11,354
And that's the way I think.
But I think a lot of people really need 

166
00:08:13,671 --> 00:08:15,770
to have that explanation.
And even for me,

167
00:08:15,771 --> 00:08:17,690
it's good to have it.
It makes it easier.

168
00:08:17,691 --> 00:08:18,524
So just the lack of explanation and that
was the lack of presentation of the 

169
00:08:21,381 --> 00:08:25,460
language concepts makes it less than a 
full language learning course.

170
00:08:25,461 --> 00:08:29,840
It's really just drilling vocabulary of 
phrases and translation of sentences.

171
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:30,793
So that means that basically you should 
use memorize along with another course 

172
00:08:33,231 --> 00:08:34,940
that is more comprehensive.
Okay.

173
00:08:34,941 --> 00:08:35,774
The second negative thing is that the 
user generated courses are both a 

174
00:08:38,661 --> 00:08:40,610
blessing and a curse.
Like I said before,

175
00:08:40,611 --> 00:08:42,380
they're a blessing because there's such 
an,

176
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:45,950
an awesome amount of variety and such a 
selection to choose from.

177
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:46,993
But at the same time,
there's not really a lot of quality 

178
00:08:49,281 --> 00:08:52,160
control and there's no standardization 
of the courses.

179
00:08:52,190 --> 00:08:54,110
Some of them are a lot better than 
others.

180
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,033
Some of them seem to introduce words in 
a really strange order or they start 

181
00:08:58,081 --> 00:08:58,914
with things that in the beginning that 
you don't need yet and that kind of 

182
00:09:00,691 --> 00:09:01,524
stuff.
So I found that I really had to search 

183
00:09:03,211 --> 00:09:04,044
around and try a few different courses 
to see which one fit my needs and then 

184
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:08,333
if it didn't fit my needs,
just leave that course and join a 

185
00:09:10,531 --> 00:09:12,090
different one.
So you have to look around,

186
00:09:12,091 --> 00:09:15,330
shop around a little bit before you 
decide what course to use.

187
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:16,223
So that's a little bit different than 
some other language learning platforms 

188
00:09:18,331 --> 00:09:19,164
that have been kind of refined and 
standardized more so that you kind of 

189
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,033
always know that you're getting a course
that they themselves have developed and 

190
00:09:25,921 --> 00:09:26,754
focused on.
Basically to sum up my positives and 

191
00:09:28,861 --> 00:09:29,694
negatives,
I would say that memorize is actually a 

192
00:09:31,171 --> 00:09:32,004
really useful tool for drilling 
vocabulary and for drilling sentences 

193
00:09:36,061 --> 00:09:39,630
and maybe doing some sentence to 
sentence translation and it's a fun tool

194
00:09:39,631 --> 00:09:41,520
to use so it's good as a supplement.

195
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:45,210
It's good to get that extra source of 
input of the language.

196
00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:46,223
It's just a useful tool but it's not a 
comprehensive language learning program 

197
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:50,393
so I wouldn't stick to only memorize 
unless you're just dabbling in a 

198
00:09:53,731 --> 00:09:56,190
language on the side.
Like if you're focused on French and you

199
00:09:56,191 --> 00:09:58,950
want to learn a bit of Portuguese,
then just use memorize.

200
00:09:58,951 --> 00:09:59,784
For some Portuguese that would be fine.
But if you are really taking a language 

201
00:10:02,791 --> 00:10:05,310
seriously,
I would have a comprehensive main course

202
00:10:05,311 --> 00:10:08,820
and then use memorize as an extra 
additional helpful tool,

203
00:10:08,821 --> 00:10:11,070
which it is.
So that's all from my impressions.

204
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:13,500
But how about you?
Have you tried memorize?

205
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:14,363
If you have,
then I ask you to leave your comments 

206
00:10:15,901 --> 00:10:17,810
down below.
Tell me what you thought of it,

207
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:18,653
was it useful for you?
And if you have some tips on how to use 

208
00:10:20,551 --> 00:10:23,100
it more effectively,
then please write that as well.

209
