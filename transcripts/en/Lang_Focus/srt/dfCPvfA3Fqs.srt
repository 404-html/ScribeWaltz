Yeah.

26
00:01:58,870 --> 00:01:59,703
All right.
That's just another little sample of my 

27
00:02:01,001 --> 00:02:03,550
progress and to gallog how it's going.
Um,

28
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:05,590
uh,
obviously I'm not fluent.

29
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:07,960
I can express myself about simple 
things.

30
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:08,794
I could make simple sentences,
I can communicate about basic things 

31
00:02:12,281 --> 00:02:13,114
with basic vocab,
but for three weeks in I'm pretty happy 

32
00:02:15,101 --> 00:02:17,230
with how things are going.
Um,

33
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:18,363
I'm looking forward to my trip to 
Philippines next week and I'll try out 

34
00:02:20,861 --> 00:02:21,694
my to gallog they're more and practice 
more and I'm going to study while I'm 

35
00:02:23,501 --> 00:02:26,410
there and hopefully that will expand my 
ability even more.

36
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:31,630
Tagalog is an interesting experience.
The only other thing I can compare it to

37
00:02:31,631 --> 00:02:32,464
is when I started studying Japanese way 
back in the beginning years and years 

38
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:37,533
ago,
because before that I had only studied 

39
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:43,480
languages that were much more similar to
English.

40
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:44,613
Like I had studied French in school,
I had studied Hebrew and modern Hebrew 

41
00:02:49,031 --> 00:02:51,460
kind of has syntax that's similar to 
English.

42
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:53,470
Like the word order is different from 
biblical Hebrew.

43
00:02:53,471 --> 00:02:56,710
It's more like English.
So when I started learning Japanese,

44
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:59,110
the word order and the grammar and 
sentence structure,

45
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:00,273
something completely different.
It kind of was difficult at first and 

46
00:03:03,491 --> 00:03:04,450
freaked me out a bit.
Like,

47
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:07,330
because I had to think in a whole new 
way and piece together.

48
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:10,330
The ideas to make sentences in a 
completely new way.

49
00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:14,590
It couldn't just change out the words 
like you can in some other languages.

50
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:17,200
And now Tagalog is kind of similar to 
that.

51
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:18,063
Similar to the old days when I started 
Japanese and I was freaking out about 

52
00:03:20,831 --> 00:03:24,730
this completely new way of expressing 
myself and to Gal looks Kinda like that,

53
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:29,410
that you can't just change the words out
into a tagalog words.

54
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:32,500
You can't just take an English sentence 
and change the words and to,

55
00:03:32,501 --> 00:03:34,630
to Gallog it won't happen,
won't,

56
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:36,940
you won't be able to express yourself 
like that at all.

57
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,910
No one would understand that.
Totally different experience.

58
00:03:39,911 --> 00:03:42,500
So that's quite fun.
Quite interesting to do that.

59
00:03:42,501 --> 00:03:43,334
It's quite mind bending and it makes me 
think in new ways and I always enjoy 

60
00:03:45,971 --> 00:03:47,560
that.
So yeah,

61
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:48,423
that's another look at how it's going.
I hope you are busy studying too and 

62
00:03:51,071 --> 00:03:53,320
improving at whatever language you're 
focused on.

63
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:54,533
Good night.
