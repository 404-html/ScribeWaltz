00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:01,043
Hello everyone.
Welcome to the Lange Focus Channel and 

2
00:00:03,061 --> 00:00:03,894
my name is Paul.
Today we'll be discussing the question 

3
00:00:06,331 --> 00:00:10,680
how similar our metropolitan French and 
Quebec French or Quebecois.

4
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:11,783
In other words,
how similar is the French spoken in 

5
00:00:13,261 --> 00:00:14,094
France to the French spoken in Quebec.
French is one of the world's major 

6
00:00:17,131 --> 00:00:17,964
languages and it's spoken in dozens of 
different countries and everywhere that 

7
00:00:20,971 --> 00:00:21,804
it's spoken,
the standard variety or the formal 

8
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:24,263
variety that's learned at school and 
used in the media is essentially the 

9
00:00:26,821 --> 00:00:27,654
same as metropolitan French based on the
Parisian variety of French in informal 

10
00:00:32,041 --> 00:00:32,790
speech.
However,

11
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:36,540
there is some variation with local 
differences in accents and vocabulary.

12
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:37,523
There's one major variety of French that
is particularly distinct from 

13
00:00:40,321 --> 00:00:43,200
Metropolitan French,
and that is the French chef Quebec,

14
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:46,170
a culturally distinct French speaking 
province in Canada.

15
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:49,860
French speakers from France often say 
that they have trouble understanding the

16
00:00:49,861 --> 00:00:51,150
French spoken in Quebec.

17
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:54,100
I should point out that the formal 
variety of French Houston,

18
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:57,090
Quebec is virtually identical to 
metropolitan French.

19
00:00:57,210 --> 00:00:58,043
The differences lie in the informal 
varieties of Quebec and an informal 

20
00:01:01,141 --> 00:01:01,974
speech.
There can be a considerable amount of 

21
00:01:03,241 --> 00:01:04,074
difference,
but why is Quebec French distinct from 

22
00:01:05,851 --> 00:01:09,060
Metropolitan French?
The reason lies in the settlement of new

23
00:01:09,061 --> 00:01:12,090
France and the later isolation of Quebec
from France.

24
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:13,103
New France was an area in North America 
that was colonized by France before the 

25
00:01:16,741 --> 00:01:18,960
creation of Canada and the United 
States,

26
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:22,440
the first settlers in new France.
We're not mainly from the Paris area,

27
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:26,070
but from regions like Normandy and 
Brittany were regional sister.

28
00:01:26,071 --> 00:01:30,390
Languages of French lung doyle were 
spoken rather than French itself,

29
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:33,690
but since French settlers were 
outnumbered by English settlers,

30
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:37,470
the King of France,
King Louis the 14th sent female settlers

31
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:38,333
mainly from the Paris area to help 
bolster their numbers through marriage 

32
00:01:40,861 --> 00:01:41,694
and childbirth.

33
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:44,280
Since these women were mainly from the 
Paris area,

34
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:46,950
they brought with them their Parisian 
variety of French,

35
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:47,873
which contributed to the decline of the 
regional languages and the adoption of 

36
00:01:50,941 --> 00:01:51,774
French among the settler population.
And of course the interaction between 

37
00:01:54,871 --> 00:01:59,100
speakers of different regional languages
encouraged the use of French as a Lingua

38
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:00,090
Franca.
As a result.

39
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:00,983
The language that developed in new 
France was similar to the language 

40
00:02:03,421 --> 00:02:04,254
spoken by the king and the aristocracy,
but was also influenced by the regional 

41
00:02:07,771 --> 00:02:08,604
languages of the settlers.
The French language became adopted 

42
00:02:10,981 --> 00:02:12,810
throughout the various regions of 
France.

43
00:02:12,811 --> 00:02:16,020
Later after the French Revolution of the
late 18th century,

44
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:20,520
the variety of French that became the 
new widespread standard language was not

45
00:02:20,521 --> 00:02:22,440
the French of the king and the 
aristocracy,

46
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,393
but rather the French of the bourgeois 
class who led the revolution prior to 

47
00:02:27,031 --> 00:02:30,090
the French Revolution.
New France had already been conquered by

48
00:02:30,091 --> 00:02:33,960
the British in 1760 and it's elite had 
returned to France.

49
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:34,883
The British soon decided to allow the 
French speaking population in what is 

50
00:02:37,861 --> 00:02:38,694
now Quebec to continue using their 
language as a way to prevent them from 

51
00:02:41,731 --> 00:02:44,310
joining the American revolution against 
the British,

52
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,530
which was taking place to the south.
Come back,

53
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,160
therefore remained under British rule,
but was isolated from France.

54
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:53,640
The French language in Quebec began 
developing in its own direction.

55
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:56,550
While the French spoken in France 
developed in its own direction.

56
00:02:56,770 --> 00:02:57,603
The vocabulary.
The vocabulary of Quebec French differs 

57
00:02:59,891 --> 00:03:02,350
from that of Metropolitan French in 
several ways.

58
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,393
First,
the two varieties of French have taken 

59
00:03:04,961 --> 00:03:07,720
in loan words from English during 
different time periods.

60
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:08,673
The French of Quebec was infused with 
English vocabulary during the period 

61
00:03:11,471 --> 00:03:16,210
from 1850 to 1960 for example,
the word for job in Quebec,

62
00:03:16,211 --> 00:03:21,211
French there is in metropolitan French 
in Quebec,

63
00:03:22,121 --> 00:03:26,050
French weird and Metropolitan French 
visa.

64
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:27,483
In Quebec,
French there's chum meaning a male 

65
00:03:29,651 --> 00:03:30,484
friend or a boyfriend and in 
metropolitan French that would be me or 

66
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:37,150
the coupon in Quebec,
French,

67
00:03:37,170 --> 00:03:40,960
there's fun in metropolitan French,
it's a museum.

68
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:42,873
Fun also appears in the phrase,
which is a direct translation of the 

69
00:03:47,081 --> 00:03:50,140
English expression to have fun.
In Metropolitan French,

70
00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:51,003
it would be send Musey expressions like 
this are called calcs or lone 

71
00:03:54,881 --> 00:03:55,714
translations.
Another example is this is translated 

72
00:03:59,411 --> 00:04:03,520
from English that makes sense.
In metropolitan friendship would be sad.

73
00:04:03,521 --> 00:04:08,260
You songs and then Quebec French people 
say to me,

74
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:09,123
you're welcome,
but in metropolitan French they would 

75
00:04:10,841 --> 00:04:12,100
say,
do the young.

76
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:15,640
The old venue means welcome in all 
varieties of French,

77
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:18,190
but not your welcome in response to 
thank you.

78
00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:21,790
Note that these are informal Quebecois 
words,

79
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:24,580
which are not considered proper and 
formal Quebec French,

80
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:27,010
which mirrors the standards of 
Metropolitan French.

81
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:28,473
Since 1960 there have been French 
language protection laws in Quebec and 

82
00:04:32,021 --> 00:04:34,420
the general distaste towards English 
systems.

83
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:36,190
Metropolitan French,
on the other hand,

84
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:38,530
doesn't have the same protective 
attitude,

85
00:04:38,531 --> 00:04:41,650
and in recent decades has been more 
influenced by English,

86
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:45,520
so it contains recent English loan words
that are not used in Quebec.

87
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:47,740
For example,
in metropolitan French,

88
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:49,840
they say email,
but in Quebec,

89
00:04:49,841 --> 00:04:51,130
French they say,
all right,

90
00:04:51,131 --> 00:04:54,010
cool.
In Metropolitan French,

91
00:04:54,050 --> 00:04:59,050
there's fun.
In Quebec they say stop signs in France,

92
00:04:59,621 --> 00:05:00,690
say,
stop.

93
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:02,890
This is not really a part of the French 
language.

94
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:05,260
It's just an international used street 
sign.

95
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:06,153
But in Quebec,
the sign say another aspect of 

96
00:05:09,611 --> 00:05:13,600
vocabulary that differs is that there 
are some words or expressions in Quebec,

97
00:05:13,601 --> 00:05:14,434
French that seem older or more 
traditional to speakers of metropolitan 

98
00:05:17,321 --> 00:05:18,154
French.
The Quebecois word for shoes is in 

99
00:05:21,461 --> 00:05:22,294
metropolitan French.
It's detial sue the Quebecois word for 

100
00:05:25,691 --> 00:05:28,150
car or Shell.
In France,

101
00:05:28,151 --> 00:05:31,150
it's [inaudible].
In France,

102
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:36,270
Shar means tank as in tank of war.
Another example is the way to say I miss

103
00:05:36,761 --> 00:05:40,570
you in Quebec,
it's [inaudible] in France.

104
00:05:40,571 --> 00:05:41,404
That would sound rather old fashion and 
the way people would usually say it is 

105
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:45,533
[inaudible].

106
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:47,753
The French of Quebec also contains 
numerous slang expressions and swear 

107
00:05:50,741 --> 00:05:52,930
words that are taken from the Catholic 
religion.

108
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:55,540
Perhaps the most famous where word of 
Quebec is.

109
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:59,930
Others include car lists,
meaning chalice,

110
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,033
a c meaning host or communion bread.
These words are only offensive and 

111
00:06:04,881 --> 00:06:08,030
Quebec and nowhere else in the 
Francophone world as far as I know,

112
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:12,890
and the French of Quebec has also just 
developed some of its own vocabulary and

113
00:06:12,891 --> 00:06:14,270
expressions.
For example,

114
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:19,300
to go shopping in Quebec,
friendships in metropolitan French,

115
00:06:19,371 --> 00:06:21,500
it's cld,
Kooks Clg,

116
00:06:21,501 --> 00:06:22,334
shipping grammar written French in 
Quebec is grammatically identical to 

117
00:06:26,901 --> 00:06:27,734
metropolitan French,
but an informal speech you might hear 

118
00:06:29,871 --> 00:06:30,704
some differences in grammar too is used 
after verbs as a yes or no question 

119
00:06:34,461 --> 00:06:37,400
marker that's in blown.
This means,

120
00:06:37,401 --> 00:06:40,300
do you have a girlfriend in metropolitan
French [inaudible]?

121
00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:41,410
[inaudible].

122
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:42,733
Notice here that is being used as a yes 
or no question marker and not as a 

123
00:06:46,521 --> 00:06:47,354
pronoun.
Also notice the Quebecois word for 

124
00:06:49,041 --> 00:06:49,874
girlfriend bloomed.
This means is it ready in metropolitan 

125
00:06:54,711 --> 00:06:56,120
French.
That would be sip.

126
00:06:56,121 --> 00:07:00,560
Sam Is cusip saying here,
notice that the subject is third person.

127
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:03,620
To be clear too is nothing but a 
question marker here.

128
00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:04,483
It's not the second person Pronoun too.
It's also used for emphasis or 

129
00:07:08,241 --> 00:07:09,530
exclamation.
See,

130
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:13,100
that's so shocking.
Seats.

131
00:07:13,130 --> 00:07:15,740
You should come next.
In Quebec,

132
00:07:15,741 --> 00:07:16,574
French cook is used as the relative 
pronoun more often than in metropolitan 

133
00:07:20,151 --> 00:07:21,600
French.
Just Shush.

134
00:07:21,630 --> 00:07:25,310
I leave Casey business.
This means I'm looking for the book that

135
00:07:25,311 --> 00:07:26,144
I need in metropolitan French.
This would be [inaudible] and in a 

136
00:07:32,061 --> 00:07:32,894
sentence with an embedded question.
In Metropolitan French you use a 

137
00:07:35,601 --> 00:07:36,434
relative pronoun,
but in Quebec French the interrogative 

138
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:43,160
pronoun is used.
Should I say this means I do what I want

139
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:48,520
in metropolitan French [inaudible] next 
in Quebec French.

140
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,113
The explicit subject of a sentence is 
often said as a tag with a pronoun as 

141
00:07:53,691 --> 00:07:56,330
the subject in the main clause.
For example,

142
00:07:56,570 --> 00:08:01,570
mall bus.
This means my boss makes me so angry.

143
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:03,013
Notice how the subject,
my boss is set aside at the beginning 

144
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:06,223
separate from the main clause and then 
the Pronoun e which is a contraction of 

145
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:12,800
eel appears in the main clause in 
metropolitan French.

146
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:17,830
This would be in Quebec,
French pla towards mound.

147
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:23,360
This means his plan is to travel around 
the world.

148
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:27,310
In metropolitan French it would be so 
pushy ewg.

149
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:29,293
This type of tag is also used in 
metropolitan French but as much more 

150
00:08:32,391 --> 00:08:33,740
common in Quebec,
French.

151
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:38,240
Next there are some differences in 
imperative forms in Quebec French.

152
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:44,620
This means tell me or tell it to me.
In Metropolitan French denim you can see

153
00:08:45,501 --> 00:08:50,501
that the object Pronoun La is positioned
differently and now the negative form in

154
00:08:52,821 --> 00:08:57,120
metropolitan French in the deeper you 
can see that in the negative,

155
00:08:57,150 --> 00:08:58,560
the syntax is quite different.

156
00:08:59,130 --> 00:09:03,000
In Metropolitan French,
the object Pronoun Ma is used instead of

157
00:09:03,001 --> 00:09:06,930
the French emphatic Pronoun Wa often 
pronounced where in Quebec,

158
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:11,100
and it comes before the verb as does the
object Pronoun Look in Quebec,

159
00:09:11,101 --> 00:09:11,934
French,
they come after the verb as they do in 

160
00:09:13,591 --> 00:09:14,424
the affirmative accent.
Probably the biggest difference between 

161
00:09:18,061 --> 00:09:18,894
the French of Quebec and Metropolitan 
France simply lies in accent without 

162
00:09:22,261 --> 00:09:24,660
previous exposure to the French spoken 
in Quebec.

163
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:27,750
French speakers from Europe typically 
have trouble understanding it,

164
00:09:27,810 --> 00:09:28,643
and this differs depending on the 
socioeconomic background and the region 

165
00:09:31,741 --> 00:09:32,574
of the speaker.
The consonants are not so different for 

166
00:09:34,501 --> 00:09:35,334
the most part,
but there are some differences in 

167
00:09:37,291 --> 00:09:40,490
Quebec,
French before the vowels e and Oo,

168
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:41,693
the consonants to enter become enza gg.
Whereas in metropolitan French it's 

169
00:09:48,271 --> 00:09:49,104
pronounced two d.
There are several different rotate 

170
00:09:52,021 --> 00:09:55,800
sounds used throughout Quebec,
including trill sounds as opposed to the

171
00:09:55,801 --> 00:09:58,140
Uvula fricative of Metropolitan French.

172
00:09:58,290 --> 00:09:59,123
However,
this is also true in France where some 

173
00:10:00,811 --> 00:10:01,644
regional accents have trills rather than
fricatives and in Quebec in formal 

174
00:10:05,341 --> 00:10:09,210
speech and in many areas,
the uvular fricative is also used.

175
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:13,200
So the situation in Quebec and Francis 
similar except that in France,

176
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:18,000
the shift towards the uvular fricative 
is more advanced vowels.

177
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:21,060
One difference is that nasal vowels are 
quite different.

178
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:22,081
In Quebec,
French,

179
00:10:22,081 --> 00:10:22,914
there's CAF,
and in metropolitan French there's 

180
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:28,710
another difference is that in Quebec,
French,

181
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:32,640
long vowels and nasal vowels become 
diphthongs in open syllables.

182
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:35,210
So in Quebec,
French we have fights,

183
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:39,090
but in metropolitan French there's sit 
in Quebec,

184
00:10:39,091 --> 00:10:42,390
French,
we have pi in metropolitan French,

185
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:43,253
it's damn related to that.
Quebec French retain some long vowels 

186
00:10:47,551 --> 00:10:50,850
from older French that have become short
in metropolitan French.

187
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:53,400
For example,
in metropolitan French,

188
00:10:53,430 --> 00:10:57,040
these two words sound the same mate 
mate,

189
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:58,530
but in Quebec,
French,

190
00:10:58,531 --> 00:10:59,364
they don't.

191
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:03,690
My Net,
these are just a couple of examples,

192
00:11:03,691 --> 00:11:06,360
but there are numerous distinctions like
these intervals.

193
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:09,810
Some words also become contracted in 
Quebec,

194
00:11:09,811 --> 00:11:11,220
French,
for example,

195
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:14,580
sue meaning on followed by a definite 
article,

196
00:11:14,610 --> 00:11:15,443
gets contracted sill say,
now let's look at a few sentences to 

197
00:11:23,011 --> 00:11:24,360
compare.
Here's the sentence,

198
00:11:24,361 --> 00:11:28,170
meaning I fell in love with her because 
she's beautiful in Quebec.

199
00:11:28,171 --> 00:11:29,004
French.
She tell him down that I called Kenny 

200
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:36,630
van and in metropolitan French she vm 
Udin Pascali Bill.

201
00:11:37,170 --> 00:11:40,970
Here we can see a quebecois expression 
Tome Bay on the Moon [inaudible],

202
00:11:41,130 --> 00:11:44,400
which is a calc of the English 
expression fall in love with,

203
00:11:44,610 --> 00:11:45,443
and here we see two different phrases,
meaning because I called Tsca is an 

204
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:49,553
older phrase,
which is obsolete and metropolitan 

205
00:11:51,301 --> 00:11:53,190
French,
but it's still used in Quebec.

206
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:54,593
Another pair of sentences.
This time they mean I want to go out 

207
00:11:57,131 --> 00:11:58,570
with my friends on the weekend

208
00:11:59,210 --> 00:12:01,540
in Quebec,
French off to Hong Gang,

209
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:02,550
often salmon

210
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:08,260
and in metropolitan French [inaudible] 
weekend in the Quebec French sentence we

211
00:12:08,721 --> 00:12:09,554
see on gun,
which means with a group of friends or 

212
00:12:11,721 --> 00:12:12,554
colleagues.
This phrase is strictly a Quebecois 

213
00:12:14,271 --> 00:12:15,104
phrase,
so when Metropolitan French you'd say 

214
00:12:16,581 --> 00:12:17,740
something like,
evict me.

215
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:20,820
Awesome.
Next we see the phrase of fantasy man,

216
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:23,870
which means on the weekend in 
metropolitan French,

217
00:12:23,930 --> 00:12:27,320
the usual term is the weekend or in this
context,

218
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:28,183
so weekend.
This is an [inaudible] that has not 

219
00:12:30,281 --> 00:12:31,114
entered Quebec French due to its 
language protection efforts in 

220
00:12:33,761 --> 00:12:35,890
metropolitan French.
Someone might say,

221
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:36,813
fend to some man,
but to refer to the end of the workweek 

222
00:12:41,650 --> 00:12:42,483
like Thursday,
Friday before the weekend.

223
00:12:42,510 --> 00:12:44,820
Now let's look at one last pair of 
sentences.

224
00:12:44,910 --> 00:12:48,360
This time they mean I'm going to park 
the car here and ride my bike

225
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:50,240
in Quebec,
French.

226
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:52,560
Should we be back?
It'll show you see your motives

227
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:57,580
and Metropolitan French choosy guide of 
which you receive a porn movie loo.

228
00:12:57,930 --> 00:12:58,763
Here we see a uniquely Quebecois phrase 
park in the Shah with the verb that 

229
00:13:03,181 --> 00:13:04,014
comes from the English word park and 
again we see the word Sha meaning car 

230
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:11,420
and notice that the words for bicycle 
are different in Quebec,

231
00:13:11,421 --> 00:13:12,254
the common word is BC clit.
This word isn't a lone word from 

232
00:13:14,841 --> 00:13:15,860
English.
In fact,

233
00:13:15,861 --> 00:13:18,680
it appeared in French before the word 
bicycle appeared in English.

234
00:13:18,830 --> 00:13:19,663
It's a standard French word,
but is generally considered old 

235
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:25,900
fashioned to speakers of metropolitan 
French who mainly use the word veilleux.

236
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:28,223
As we've seen,
the French of Quebec has a number of 

237
00:13:29,791 --> 00:13:32,820
different features that distinguish it 
from metropolitan French,

238
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,390
but it seems to me that people sometimes
exaggerate these differences.

239
00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:38,700
There are significant differences in 
accent,

240
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:39,593
but that seems like something that would
cease to be much of a problem with 

241
00:13:41,941 --> 00:13:43,530
significant exposure to it.

242
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:44,633
In terms of vocabulary,
Quebec has its own informal expressions 

243
00:13:47,641 --> 00:13:48,474
and slang,
but so do other French speaking areas 

244
00:13:50,071 --> 00:13:50,904
including Paris in terms of grammar,
there are some little things here and 

245
00:13:53,431 --> 00:13:57,150
there but nothing too shocking.
And of course formal French in Quebec is

246
00:13:57,151 --> 00:14:00,780
very close to formal French in France,
albeit with a different accent.

247
00:14:00,930 --> 00:14:04,410
The question of the day for native 
speakers of French from Quebec,

248
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:05,333
from your point of view,
how different is your variety of French 

249
00:14:07,530 --> 00:14:11,620
from the French spoken in Europe and for
native speakers of French from Europe?

250
00:14:11,770 --> 00:14:12,603
How well can you understand the French 
spoken in Quebec and for learners of 

251
00:14:16,161 --> 00:14:16,994
French,
assuming that you're learning 

252
00:14:17,871 --> 00:14:18,704
metropolitan French,
what do you think of the French spoken 

253
00:14:20,901 --> 00:14:23,120
in Quebec?
Is it hard to make sense of?

254
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:25,740
Be sure to follow Lang,
focus on facebook,

255
00:14:25,741 --> 00:14:26,574
twitter and instagram and once again 
thank you to all of my patrion 

256
00:14:29,431 --> 00:14:30,264
supporters,
especially my top tier or Patrion 

257
00:14:31,831 --> 00:14:34,200
supporters,
these wonderful people right here on the

258
00:14:34,201 --> 00:14:36,990
screen.
Many thanks to them and to everyone.

259
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:39,750
Thank you for watching and have a nice 
day.
