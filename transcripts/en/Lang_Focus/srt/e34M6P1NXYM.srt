00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:08,370
Hello everyone.
Welcome to the Lange focus channel.

2
00:00:08,371 --> 00:00:09,820
In.
My name is Paul.

3
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:14,100
Today's topic is the languages of Italy.
As you probably know,

4
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:14,993
Italy is located in Europe on the 
Mediterranean Sea and shares borders 

5
00:00:18,421 --> 00:00:19,740
with France,
Switzerland,

6
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:22,260
Austria,
Slovenia in San Marino.

7
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:25,080
Why not call this video the Italian 
language?

8
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:28,890
That's because Italian,
as we normally think of it,

9
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:31,500
is not the only language of Italy in 
Italy.

10
00:00:31,501 --> 00:00:35,520
There have historically been many 
different local varieties of speech that

11
00:00:35,521 --> 00:00:39,630
developed from Vulgar Latin.
These dialects differ significantly from

12
00:00:39,631 --> 00:00:40,464
one locale to another,
but they can be grouped together with 

13
00:00:42,781 --> 00:00:45,420
other similar dialects and those groups 
have dialects,

14
00:00:45,421 --> 00:00:48,960
can be considered regional languages.
One of these groups have dialects,

15
00:00:48,961 --> 00:00:50,940
is Tuscan for Tulsa,
Donald,

16
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:54,390
which forms the basis of standard 
Italian to be precise.

17
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:57,330
The Tuscan dialect of Florence spoken in
the 15th,

18
00:00:57,460 --> 00:01:00,480
16th centuries formed the basis of 
standard Italian.

19
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:03,720
The modern Tuscan dialects,
which vary from place to place,

20
00:01:03,810 --> 00:01:06,360
are spoken by around three point $5,
million people,

21
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:08,460
mainly in Tuscany,
Umbria,

22
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:12,390
and a couple of locales on the islands 
of Sardinia and Corsica.

23
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:16,070
Standard Italian on the other hand,
is spoken by most of Italy,

24
00:01:16,071 --> 00:01:19,680
60 million people.
It's now learned universally by Italians

25
00:01:19,681 --> 00:01:23,400
because it's the language of education 
and the media and in many areas,

26
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:24,263
especially urban areas,
it has largely replaced the traditional 

27
00:01:26,941 --> 00:01:29,220
regional languages in most of the 
country,

28
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:31,320
say from around Rome to the north.

29
00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:32,293
The regional languages are used mostly 
amongst the elderly and in more casual 

30
00:01:35,671 --> 00:01:36,504
speech,
especially outside of the larger cities 

31
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:41,490
in the south of the country,
specifically in companion,

32
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:42,413
Calabria and Sicily as well as Sardinia.
Regional languages are more widely 

33
00:01:46,021 --> 00:01:46,854
spoken,
but the trend is that the regional 

34
00:01:48,601 --> 00:01:51,240
languages are fading for the most part.
Why?

35
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:54,300
When it's only became a nation in 18,
61,

36
00:01:54,330 --> 00:01:55,163
the policy was to Italian people in all 
the different regions of the new 

37
00:01:58,230 --> 00:02:00,990
country.
This was done by making Italian the sole

38
00:02:00,991 --> 00:02:03,870
language of education and of media and 
of government.

39
00:02:04,410 --> 00:02:05,243
Also internal migration of people 
seeking new industrial jobs brought the 

40
00:02:08,911 --> 00:02:11,340
speakers of different regional languages
together,

41
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:15,630
forcing them to speak standard Italian 
in order to communicate in such regions.

42
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:16,493
Notably in the north,
the regional languages have faded more 

43
00:02:18,691 --> 00:02:22,230
quickly.
Data from the Italian National Institute

44
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:25,830
of Statistics shows that around half of 
Italians speak mainly Italian with their

45
00:02:25,831 --> 00:02:26,664
families and friends,
and this number rises to 72 point eight 

46
00:02:29,311 --> 00:02:30,144
percent when speaking to strangers,
about 33 percent of people speak both 

47
00:02:33,481 --> 00:02:36,330
Italian and their dialect with family 
and friends,

48
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,340
and 19 percent with strangers.

49
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:41,490
Sixteen percent speak only their dialect
with their families.

50
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:42,563
13 point two percent speak only in 
dialect with their friends and five 

51
00:02:45,931 --> 00:02:46,764
point four percent with strangers.
Notice that I wrote the word dialect 

52
00:02:49,711 --> 00:02:50,544
with quotation marks.
We have to be careful with that word 

53
00:02:52,531 --> 00:02:53,364
dialect because it might suggest that 
these regional languages are varieties 

54
00:02:56,761 --> 00:03:01,620
of standard Italian varieties of Tuscan,
but they are not varieties of Italian or

55
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:02,463
Tuscan from which Italian derived they 
developed in parallel with Tuscan their 

56
00:03:06,131 --> 00:03:10,210
dialect in the sense that there are many
different local varieties of speech,

57
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:12,670
but they are not dialects of one single 
language.

58
00:03:12,850 --> 00:03:13,683
These dialects are often quite different
from each other and they are grouped 

59
00:03:16,271 --> 00:03:18,460
together based on their historical 
development.

60
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:19,373
There are common features and their 
mutual intelligibility and can be 

61
00:03:21,911 --> 00:03:22,744
thought of as languages,
but most of these languages are not 

62
00:03:24,971 --> 00:03:25,804
standardized and exactly how to group 
the dialects together is not always 

63
00:03:28,781 --> 00:03:29,614
clear and standard Italian spread and 
began to replace the traditional 

64
00:03:32,861 --> 00:03:33,820
regional languages.

65
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:34,803
Some features of those traditional 
languages made their way into standard 

66
00:03:37,421 --> 00:03:38,254
Italian in each area.
This resulted in different dialects of 

67
00:03:40,781 --> 00:03:41,614
standard Italian,
mostly different accents and also some 

68
00:03:43,901 --> 00:03:46,960
casual vocabulary adopted from those 
regional languages.

69
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:48,363
Some of Italy's language groups are 
recognized as historic language 

70
00:03:51,101 --> 00:03:53,530
minorities such as Albanian,
German,

71
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:56,780
Greek,
Slovenian,

72
00:03:56,780 --> 00:03:59,260
Croatian French Frankel,
provont sal for Julian Ladene,

73
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:01,900
oxytocin,
Katelyn and Sardinian.

74
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,033
Some of these are not romance languages 
and some of them are national languages 

75
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:08,680
or regional languages in other nearby 
countries.

76
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:09,663
It's also worth noting that the language
is on this list that are specific to 

77
00:04:12,311 --> 00:04:16,180
Italy all have standard written forms 
which may be part of the reason they are

78
00:04:16,181 --> 00:04:19,420
recognized as minority languages and not
mere dialects.

79
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:23,410
Other such languages with standard 
written forms are Piedmontese,

80
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:24,303
the European and Venetian.
The regional language with the largest 

81
00:04:27,041 --> 00:04:30,480
number of speakers is neapolitan or 
mobility.

82
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:34,120
It is spoken by around five point 7 
million people,

83
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:36,110
primarily in bustled,
Lazio,

84
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:38,260
a brute,
so and Malisa Pouliot,

85
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:42,970
Basilicata and parts of Calabria like 
standard Italian and Tuscan.

86
00:04:43,090 --> 00:04:47,620
It is part of the Italo Dalmatian branch
of the romance languages and it has some

87
00:04:47,621 --> 00:04:49,990
degree of intelligibility for speakers 
of Italian,

88
00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:53,320
but it's also influenced by Spanish,
French and Arabic.

89
00:04:53,650 --> 00:04:54,483
This is not one of the recognized 
minority languages and is often 

90
00:04:57,071 --> 00:04:58,630
considered a dialect.
In Italy,

91
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:01,540
though it's very reasonable to consider 
it a separate language.

92
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:06,400
The second most widely spoken is 
Sicilian or Siciliano.

93
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:09,280
It is spoken by around four point 7 
million people,

94
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:11,830
primarily in Sicily and in parts of 
Calabria.

95
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:13,023
It is also an Italo Dalmatian language 
like Neapolitan Sicilian has been 

96
00:05:16,511 --> 00:05:18,790
influenced by foreign languages.
Greek,

97
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,020
Arabic,
Spanish,

98
00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:20,883
Katelyn and French.
Sicilian is sometimes said to be the 

99
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:24,903
oldest romance language,
meaning it was the earliest language to 

100
00:05:27,431 --> 00:05:30,730
split off from vulgar Latin,
but not everyone accepts this idea.

101
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:34,270
This is not one of the recognized 
minority languages,

102
00:05:34,271 --> 00:05:39,271
either another is Venetian or Veneto,
which is spoken by around three point $9

103
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:44,660
million people in the Veneto region as 
well as a neighboring Trentino Alto,

104
00:05:44,661 --> 00:05:47,020
our Dj and Friuli Veneto Julia.

105
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:48,133
The nation was a language of prestige 
and the time of the Venetian republic 

106
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:55,120
and Venetian was an important part of 
the Mediterranean Lingua Franca,

107
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:56,013
also known as severe,
a regional pigeon language spoken 

108
00:05:58,641 --> 00:05:59,474
between the 11th and 19th centuries.
This is also not one of the recognized 

109
00:06:03,021 --> 00:06:07,110
minority languages.
Next is Lombard or Lombardo,

110
00:06:07,330 --> 00:06:09,710
which is spoken by three point 6 million
people,

111
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:13,010
mainly in the lumbar region and parts of
neighboring regions.

112
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:15,650
It is part of the Gallo Italia Romance 
Branch,

113
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:20,740
along with the Durian and Piedmontese 
Piedmontese or pmo and pays is spoken by

114
00:06:21,801 --> 00:06:22,634
around one point 6 million people mainly
in the Piedmont region of northwestern 

115
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:26,803
Italy.
The gear in or Laguna is spoken by 

116
00:06:29,121 --> 00:06:32,090
around 500,000
people in the [inaudible] region.

117
00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:35,800
Another Gallo metallic language is 
Emilia-romagna.

118
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:39,710
All this language consists of two 
closely related dialect groups,

119
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:43,820
a million and Roman Yoel.
It is spoken by around one point seven,

120
00:06:43,821 --> 00:06:47,270
3 million people,
mainly in the region of Emilia Romania.

121
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:50,180
This is not a recognized minority 
language.

122
00:06:51,530 --> 00:06:56,420
Next is Sardinian or suicide to do.
It is spoken by around 1 million people,

123
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:57,373
mainly on the island of Sardinia.
Sardinian is not part of the Italo 

124
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:01,453
Dalmatian branch,
but forms of separate Sardinian branch 

125
00:07:03,111 --> 00:07:03,944
of romance languages,
so it's less intelligible for speakers 

126
00:07:06,231 --> 00:07:08,540
of Italian.
Then Neapolitan or Sicilian.

127
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:11,270
Sardinian is a recognized minority 
language.

128
00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:12,883
Next is Freudian or foot lung,
which is spoken in the northeastern 

129
00:07:16,521 --> 00:07:20,210
region of Friuli by around 600,000
native speakers.

130
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:24,290
It is a retail romance language that is 
related to another language in northeast

131
00:07:24,291 --> 00:07:26,240
Italy.
Ladene as well as the role.

132
00:07:26,241 --> 00:07:27,074
Much language spoken in Switzerland for 
Julian is a recognized minority 

133
00:07:30,231 --> 00:07:31,064
language.
Ladene is also a recognized minority 

134
00:07:33,531 --> 00:07:36,320
language and a spoken by around 50,000
people.

135
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:41,210
There are also the central Italian 
dialects or the [inaudible].

136
00:07:41,450 --> 00:07:43,450
They are spoken in Lazio,
Umbria,

137
00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:46,100
central Medicaid,
the southern part of Tuscany,

138
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:47,350
and part of a brutal.

139
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:50,780
These dialects are closely related with 
each other and with Tuscan,

140
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:53,390
and they're all part of the Tallow 
Dalmatian branch.

141
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:57,140
These are thought of as Italian dialects
rather than separate languages,

142
00:07:57,260 --> 00:07:59,120
even though they didn't develop from 
Tuscan,

143
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:01,460
but developed as sister dialects to 
Tuscan.

144
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:04,220
There are around 3 million speakers of 
these dialects.

145
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:05,413
Keep in mind that the number of speakers
for these regional languages might be 

146
00:08:07,911 --> 00:08:08,744
misleading because virtually everybody 
has also fluent in standard Italian and 

147
00:08:12,621 --> 00:08:16,190
their use of the regional languages 
might be limited to certain situations.

148
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:17,203
For example,
in communicating with their elderly 

149
00:08:18,651 --> 00:08:19,484
relatives in smaller numbers,
there are also the languages spoken in 

150
00:08:22,251 --> 00:08:25,280
neighboring countries either as regional
or national languages.

151
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:26,143
German through are about 293,000
speakers in northern areas of Italy 

152
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:32,330
adjacent to Germany,
Austria and Switzerland.

153
00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:36,920
Franco provolone solve has around 90,000
speakers in the north near France,

154
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:40,310
mostly in Piedmont.
Albanian has around 80,000

155
00:08:40,311 --> 00:08:41,144
speakers.

156
00:08:41,210 --> 00:08:45,320
Slovene has around 70,000
speakers near the border with Slovenia.

157
00:08:45,710 --> 00:08:49,550
Oxytocin has around 40,000
speakers in Piedmont and the Judea.

158
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:50,743
Katelyn is spoken by around 20,000
people in the city of alligator on 

159
00:08:54,411 --> 00:08:57,000
Sardinia,
which began as a Katelyn settlement.

160
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:58,313
Keeping in mind that the regional 
romance languages are generally 

161
00:09:00,421 --> 00:09:03,870
considered dialects in Italy.
I thought it would be fun to have a look

162
00:09:03,871 --> 00:09:06,210
at some of them at see how similar or 
different they are.

163
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:11,360
Let's look at standard Italian 
Neapolitan Sardinian and for Uli in it,

164
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:12,703
allegedly,
this means I would like something to 

165
00:09:14,491 --> 00:09:18,060
read word for word.
It's would like first person singular,

166
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:22,720
something to read and to Neapolitan 
whooley causality.

167
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:23,693
Judah here,
the words all correspond and if you're 

168
00:09:25,681 --> 00:09:26,514
looking for it,
you can see the connection between the 

169
00:09:27,901 --> 00:09:28,734
words,
but the words are also different enough 

170
00:09:30,181 --> 00:09:31,014
to make comprehensive difficult 
neapolitan words are often shorter than 

171
00:09:33,811 --> 00:09:37,860
the Italian equivalence with final 
vowels or final syllables reduced.

172
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:39,720
In Italian,
there's vote a.

173
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:44,670
This becomes valueless in Neapolitan.
I've also seen this spelled with an e at

174
00:09:44,671 --> 00:09:47,550
the end.
Neapolitan spelling is not standardized.

175
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:51,390
Italian quality causa is Qaqc course in 
Neapolitan.

176
00:09:51,570 --> 00:09:54,930
The Italian preposition dot meaning from
or buy,

177
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:59,010
but also used to be for an infinitive 
like this becomes our in the Apollo.

178
00:09:59,011 --> 00:09:59,844
Isn't the word for reed is similar 
except the final vowel sound after our 

179
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:07,230
is more like the Schwab in the Apollo 
written more like an ah sound.

180
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:08,303
Unstressed.
Vowels often sounds like Schwab in the 

181
00:10:10,021 --> 00:10:14,430
Apollo isn't and these reduced vowels 
are sometimes not written in Sardinian.

182
00:10:14,830 --> 00:10:15,663
You have all the lead,
unlike an Italian Neapolitan in which 

183
00:10:19,771 --> 00:10:22,380
the Personal Pronoun Ego was dropped 
here,

184
00:10:22,381 --> 00:10:24,810
it's included and didn't Sardinian it's 
Ia,

185
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,850
but I believe this can also be dropped 
in.

186
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:27,693
Sardinian boldly is the conditional form
of the verb which comes from the same 

187
00:10:31,411 --> 00:10:32,244
root as the Italian Neapolitan once,
but it takes on a different form and 

188
00:10:35,131 --> 00:10:36,780
Sardinian here.

189
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:39,270
Quality Coza is represented by two 
words,

190
00:10:40,650 --> 00:10:41,483
I believe means some on its own.
Here at the preposition is slightly 

191
00:10:44,881 --> 00:10:47,460
different and then we have the verb 
meaning to read,

192
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:49,380
which is obviously related to the 
others,

193
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:54,500
but the infinitive is formed differently
and in Freeland evil that is here we see

194
00:10:55,921 --> 00:10:58,290
the personal pronoun.
He in Freeland,

195
00:10:58,350 --> 00:10:59,183
this can't be dropped.
The verb here clearly comes from the 

196
00:11:01,651 --> 00:11:02,484
same root as the others,
but this one takes on quite a different 

197
00:11:04,771 --> 00:11:05,604
form and as a learner of Italian,
I might mistake this for the Italian 

198
00:11:08,641 --> 00:11:10,920
word velocity,
which means to fly.

199
00:11:11,130 --> 00:11:11,963
The word for something is out.
I don't actually know the root of this 

200
00:11:14,611 --> 00:11:15,444
word,
but the way I'll remember it is that it 

201
00:11:16,771 --> 00:11:19,470
sounds like the middle of quality.
Cool.

202
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:20,333
Now I'll never forget this word here.
Notice the slightly different 

203
00:11:22,861 --> 00:11:25,530
preposition and notice the infinitive of
the verb,

204
00:11:25,531 --> 00:11:26,460
meaning to read.

205
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:28,740
This looks quite different from the 
Italian word,

206
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:33,290
but it looks rather similar to the 
French word Leah or Spanish layer.

207
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:34,313
So far.
You can probably notice a lot of 

208
00:11:35,641 --> 00:11:37,500
similarity when you look at the 
sentences,

209
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:38,513
but there's also enough difference to 
make these mutually unintelligible to a 

210
00:11:41,281 --> 00:11:42,114
large extent.
When they're spoken Miano date that is 

211
00:11:46,261 --> 00:11:49,320
solely owned Digi.
This sentence means they told me that we

212
00:11:49,321 --> 00:11:51,930
will arrive around 11:00
word for word.

213
00:11:51,931 --> 00:11:52,764
It's to me,
they have said that we will arrive 

214
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:56,673
around the 11 in the Apollo written 
modernity took here we see that the 

215
00:12:02,830 --> 00:12:07,830
object pronoun contracts with the verb 
and notice again that a neapolitan,

216
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:10,980
the final vowel becomes reduced to a 
Schwa sound.

217
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:15,310
The main verb here that he is the 
equivalent of Ditto in Italian,

218
00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:16,203
d sounds in Italian,
often correspond to our sounds in 

219
00:12:18,491 --> 00:12:19,324
Neapolitan.
The Word K is pronounced cook when 

220
00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:22,503
unstressed and contracts with the 
following verb because of its initial 

221
00:12:25,421 --> 00:12:26,254
vowel sound,
the Italian word or got a mall is a vm 

222
00:12:29,590 --> 00:12:33,580
in Neapolitan pay is the equivalent of 
pad in Italian,

223
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:37,260
meaning for the wounded she becomes 
liquid in the show.

224
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:38,373
Once again,
notice all those reduced sounds in 

225
00:12:40,451 --> 00:12:45,451
Sardinian monthly.
Now do by region.

226
00:12:46,450 --> 00:12:47,283
Here we can see that similar to the 
other languages in Sardinia in the past 

227
00:12:50,321 --> 00:12:52,720
can be expressed by using the auxiliary 
verb,

228
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:55,570
meaning to have,
even though it looks quite different,

229
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:58,450
the unsound is a hint.
The main verb,

230
00:12:58,451 --> 00:12:59,530
however,
is different.

231
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:03,580
I'll speculate that this for now is 
related to the Latin verb.

232
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:07,210
Not meaning to tell or narrate,
though I'm not sure.

233
00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:11,040
Okay.
In Italian is cut the future tenses from

234
00:13:11,050 --> 00:13:13,270
differently and Sardinian with an 
auxiliary verb.

235
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:15,440
Here,
instead of [inaudible],

236
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:19,210
we see a candidate which is similar to 
the Italian preposition,

237
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:20,133
a controller,
which means beside here we have a 

238
00:13:22,331 --> 00:13:23,164
different definite article and wounded.
She becomes wound Digi inferiorly and 

239
00:13:30,770 --> 00:13:34,690
inferiorly and it seems that rather than
use a specific indirect object,

240
00:13:34,691 --> 00:13:35,524
pronouns to preposition is used with the
object pronouns like to me here on dee 

241
00:13:40,921 --> 00:13:41,754
dee is the past tense,
formed the same way as an Italian 

242
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:46,090
Neapolitan,
but with different forms.

243
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:47,253
Here we have the subject pronouns which 
is not necessary and the other 

244
00:13:49,481 --> 00:13:52,300
languages,
and here we have the verb for arrive,

245
00:13:52,390 --> 00:13:53,223
but you might not have immediately 
recognized it because it begins with a 

246
00:13:55,811 --> 00:13:56,644
single are rather than an a and a double
are told is the preposition meaning 

247
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:06,060
around and dish is own.
She will do it for a trestle.

248
00:14:07,330 --> 00:14:10,240
This sentence means I have two brothers 
and three sisters,

249
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:12,460
word for word.
It's have first person,

250
00:14:12,461 --> 00:14:13,294
singular present tense,
two brothers and three sisters in 

251
00:14:16,721 --> 00:14:18,400
Neapolitan.
Doing good grief.

252
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:19,373
Raga in the Italian sentence,
notice that the verb for how is a form 

253
00:14:24,131 --> 00:14:27,040
of the verb of ETA,
but in the Neapolitan sentence,

254
00:14:27,070 --> 00:14:27,903
it's taking the.
This is similar to the word used in 

255
00:14:29,651 --> 00:14:32,200
Spanish.
In Italian there's a word like this,

256
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:33,233
tenacity,
which would be 10 goal in the first 

257
00:14:34,811 --> 00:14:38,020
person singular,
but that means to hold in your hand,

258
00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:42,250
not to have in the general sense here.
The word for to is slightly different.

259
00:14:42,450 --> 00:14:43,283
Here.
The word for brothers is flat rather 

260
00:14:45,131 --> 00:14:45,964
than fill out daily,
and the word for sisters is also 

261
00:14:47,771 --> 00:14:48,604
shortened Soda Rather Than Soda.
And notice that the production of the 

262
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:54,890
endings make the gender of nouns 
somewhat unclear.

263
00:14:55,010 --> 00:14:56,030
In this case,
of course,

264
00:14:56,031 --> 00:14:58,590
we know because of their meaning,
but with other nouns,

265
00:14:58,591 --> 00:15:01,310
the gender might be less clear in 
Sardinian.

266
00:15:04,610 --> 00:15:07,370
Here's the verb tense is similar to the 
Neapolitan.

267
00:15:07,371 --> 00:15:12,371
One Tango to is deuce rather than do it,
and three is today's rather than three.

268
00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:17,390
Both the verb and the numbers remind me 
of Spanish here next.

269
00:15:17,510 --> 00:15:21,110
Friday's and Saudis mean brother and 
sister respectively,

270
00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:24,140
and notice that they formed the plural 
by adding an s.

271
00:15:24,170 --> 00:15:26,450
This is how it's done in many romance 
languages,

272
00:15:26,570 --> 00:15:30,920
but not in standard Italian in which the
final vowel of the word indicates number

273
00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:35,930
in for Julian.
Again,

274
00:15:35,931 --> 00:15:38,490
we see that the Pronoun can't be dropped
in for your lead.

275
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:42,230
Here we see the verb to have,
which is a cognate with the verb and the

276
00:15:42,231 --> 00:15:43,064
Italian sentence.
Unlike the ones in the Neapolitan and 

277
00:15:45,141 --> 00:15:47,550
Sardinian sentences,
it's pronounced it,

278
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:51,770
but you can see a connection with the 
French word a to his dose,

279
00:15:51,830 --> 00:15:52,663
like in Spanish.
The word for brother is basically the 

280
00:15:54,621 --> 00:15:58,370
same as the Sardinian word,
and the plural is formed by adding s.

281
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:01,850
The word for sister Sol is like the 
French word,

282
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:06,860
so as you can see from these examples,
there's a lot of linguistic diversity in

283
00:16:06,861 --> 00:16:10,820
Italy with regional languages and their 
local dialects having their own colorful

284
00:16:10,821 --> 00:16:14,270
features that reflect the history and 
the traditions of their speakers.

285
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:15,223
Many of these languages and dialects are
endangered and risk being completely 

286
00:16:18,291 --> 00:16:21,170
replaced by standard Italian.
In the coming generations.

287
00:16:21,470 --> 00:16:23,780
There are some efforts to preserve these
languages,

288
00:16:23,810 --> 00:16:24,643
but will they succeed?
And that brings me to the question of 

289
00:16:26,781 --> 00:16:30,320
the day for people who speak both 
Italian and another language of Italy,

290
00:16:30,410 --> 00:16:31,243
how often do you use your traditional 
local language and in what situations 

291
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:38,420
and for learners of Italian has the 
influence of these traditional languages

292
00:16:38,421 --> 00:16:41,660
and dialects ever affected your 
communication with native speakers?

293
00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:44,540
Let us know in the comments down below.
Be sure to follow lane,

294
00:16:44,541 --> 00:16:46,070
focus on facebook,
twitter,

295
00:16:46,071 --> 00:16:47,840
and instagram.
And once again,

296
00:16:47,841 --> 00:16:50,360
thank you to all of my wonderful patrion
