1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,260
Hey Paul,
when are you going to finish?

2
00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:02,273
What do you mean?
When are you going to finish talking 

3
00:00:03,391 --> 00:00:04,680
about I talky?
Oh,

4
00:00:04,681 --> 00:00:06,060
I'm already finished.
Okay,

5
00:00:06,061 --> 00:00:06,894
good.
Because you have a language video to 

6
00:00:07,771 --> 00:00:08,521
make.
Oh,

7
00:00:08,521 --> 00:00:10,940
that's right.
What language does it today finish?

8
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:11,700
Yeah,
yeah,

9
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:16,700
I'm finished.
Hello everyone.

10
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:21,210
Welcome to the Lange Focus Channel and 
my name is Paul.

11
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:24,420
Today I'm going to talk about the 
Finnish language.

12
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:25,613
As you probably know,
finish is the majority language spoken 

13
00:00:27,661 --> 00:00:29,880
in Finland.
It has about 5.4

14
00:00:29,881 --> 00:00:33,840
million native speakers with 4.9
million of them living in Finland,

15
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:36,510
which is about 90% of the population of 
Finland.

16
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:40,140
It's one of the two official languages 
of Finland along with Swedish,

17
00:00:40,141 --> 00:00:40,974
which is spoken by about 5% of the 
population and there were also finished 

18
00:00:43,861 --> 00:00:46,200
speaking minorities across the border in
Russia,

19
00:00:46,201 --> 00:00:47,034
in Norway and in Sweden.
You may have seen my video on the north 

20
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:50,550
dramatic languages.

21
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:51,383
It's this one right here and you might 
remember that I specifically excluded 

22
00:00:54,931 --> 00:00:55,764
finish from that video.
That's because even though Finland is a 

23
00:00:58,411 --> 00:01:02,430
Nordic country with geographic and 
historical connections to Scandinavia,

24
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:05,730
the Finnish language is not an north 
Germanic language.

25
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,190
In fact,
it's not even an Indo European language.

26
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:10,500
It is part of the Finnish language 
group,

27
00:01:10,501 --> 00:01:12,780
which is a branch of the urologic 
language family.

28
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,900
Other members of the finet group,
our Estonian Cornellian,

29
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:19,020
Ludic Vips,
ingredient votech and Livonians,

30
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:22,710
but finish is the most widely spoken 
language in the Finnish language group.

31
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:25,560
All the Finnick languages developed from
Prodo Finnick,

32
00:01:25,561 --> 00:01:30,060
which was spoken around 3000 years ago.
The first stage was early Prodo Finnick.

33
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,280
Then during the middle protal finnick 
period,

34
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:36,780
some changes took place in that language
and it's split into two protos Samak,

35
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:40,380
the ancestor of the Cemak languages and 
late Prodo Finnick,

36
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:44,520
which ultimately became the most recent 
ancestor of all the Finnick languages.

37
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:45,383
It's worth noting that finished contains
a significant number of Germanic loan 

38
00:01:48,391 --> 00:01:49,224
words,
some of them which are clearly ancient 

39
00:01:50,521 --> 00:01:52,230
in origin.
For example,

40
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:54,630
kooning gas,
which means king do lead,

41
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:57,690
which means chair,
and it comes from the same root as stool

42
00:01:57,780 --> 00:01:58,613
and gold loops,
which means school from words like 

43
00:02:01,141 --> 00:02:01,974
these,
we can see that the ancient fins had 

44
00:02:03,061 --> 00:02:07,710
extensive contact with Germanic peoples.
Linked Prodo Finnick diverged into three

45
00:02:07,711 --> 00:02:09,300
dialects,
eastern Prodo,

46
00:02:09,301 --> 00:02:10,620
Finnick,
northern Prodo,

47
00:02:10,621 --> 00:02:11,454
Finnick and southern Prodo Finnick.
These three dialects of Lake Prodo 

48
00:02:14,431 --> 00:02:15,264
finnick mixed with each other and the 
resulting mixes of influences developed 

49
00:02:18,541 --> 00:02:21,030
into the dialects that make up the 
Finnish language.

50
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:22,043
Around the 12th Century and 13th century
Ce Sweden conquered Finland and made it 

51
00:02:25,891 --> 00:02:28,680
a province of their country and for the 
next few hundred years,

52
00:02:28,681 --> 00:02:29,514
Swedish was the language of 
administration and during this time the 

53
00:02:31,721 --> 00:02:32,554
middle low German was the Lingua Franca 
of commerce in the area and Latin was 

54
00:02:36,121 --> 00:02:37,230
the language of religion.

55
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:38,183
Swedish and middle low German left an 
additional dramatic influence on 

56
00:02:41,041 --> 00:02:41,874
finished,
which during that time was strictly a 

57
00:02:43,231 --> 00:02:46,500
language of daily communication.
Finished did not really become a written

58
00:02:46,501 --> 00:02:47,334
language until the 16th century.
When a finished bishop named Mikael 

59
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:54,060
Agricola created the first comprehensive
writing system for the language.

60
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:56,430
He based that system on the orthography 
of German,

61
00:02:56,431 --> 00:02:57,420
Swedish,
and Latin,

62
00:02:57,510 --> 00:03:00,190
and it still forms the basis of the 
finished writing system today,

63
00:03:00,191 --> 00:03:01,870
although there have been changes since 
then.

64
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:02,793
In 1809 Russia seized Finland from 
Sweden in a war and made it an 

65
00:03:06,131 --> 00:03:08,530
autonomous state as part of the Russian 
empire.

66
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:12,190
The official language and the language 
of the elite remained Swedish,

67
00:03:12,191 --> 00:03:13,024
but finished national feeling and a 
desire to make the Finnish language 

68
00:03:15,641 --> 00:03:16,474
dominant began to increase in 1835 these
feelings were amplified by the 

69
00:03:19,961 --> 00:03:20,794
publication of culliver law or work of 
epic poetry written by alias Loon 

70
00:03:24,101 --> 00:03:27,670
wrought with stories from carilion and 
finish folklore and mythology.

71
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:28,853
Luna [inaudible] also played an 
important role in the development of 

72
00:03:30,791 --> 00:03:31,624
standard finish in 1863 finish became an
official language in Finland alongside 

73
00:03:36,371 --> 00:03:40,030
the Swedish language and they both 
remain official languages today and with

74
00:03:40,031 --> 00:03:40,864
a new sense of national identity 
emerging Finland eventually gained 

75
00:03:43,571 --> 00:03:47,770
independence from Russia in 1917 before 
standard finish was created.

76
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:51,280
The Finnish language consisted of a 
number of dialects that could be roughly

77
00:03:51,281 --> 00:03:53,770
divided into eastern and western 
dialects.

78
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:58,030
The Western dialects are the ones upon 
which standard finish was largely based.

79
00:03:58,090 --> 00:03:58,923
From what I understand these days,
the dialects mostly consist of 

80
00:04:00,971 --> 00:04:01,804
differences in accent,
but outside of Finland there are a few 

81
00:04:04,151 --> 00:04:04,984
interesting dialects that are officially
considered to be different languages 

82
00:04:07,751 --> 00:04:10,210
even though they are intelligible with 
standard finish.

83
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:13,200
This includes the Corelli in language 
and Russia may Anchia Lee,

84
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:16,630
which is spoken by a Finnish minority 
and Sweden and Kevin,

85
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:18,640
which is spoken by a minority in Norway.

86
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:22,510
So what is the Finnish language like?
Well,

87
00:04:22,511 --> 00:04:25,870
it shares some features with the other 
members of the Finnish language group.

88
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:28,480
Some of those features are no 
grammatical gender.

89
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,640
There was no distinction between 
masculine,

90
00:04:30,641 --> 00:04:33,970
feminine or Neuter,
not even in the personal pronouns.

91
00:04:34,130 --> 00:04:36,160
Hum.
It means both he and she,

92
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:37,263
and interestingly,
Finland was one of the first countries 

93
00:04:38,621 --> 00:04:39,454
to grant women the right to vote and it 
was one of the first to have a female 

94
00:04:42,011 --> 00:04:42,844
president.
So maybe gender equality is just built 

95
00:04:44,981 --> 00:04:47,290
into the language and way of thinking.
Hey,

96
00:04:47,291 --> 00:04:49,780
you never know.
Next no articles.

97
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:52,480
Articles are the words like [inaudible] 
or the in English.

98
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:56,080
English speakers often wonder how you 
can communicate without those articles,

99
00:04:56,081 --> 00:04:59,410
but the context usually provides enough 
meaning that you don't actually need the

100
00:04:59,411 --> 00:05:00,244
articles.
Next finish has some prepositions in 

101
00:05:02,801 --> 00:05:03,634
English.
Those are words showing location or 

102
00:05:04,661 --> 00:05:09,661
relationship like two or apps or on,
but finish has many more post positions.

103
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:12,160
These are similar to prepositions in 
function,

104
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:15,940
but they come after the word that they 
add meaning to rather than before.

105
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:19,570
Here's an example sentence with the post
position already on Coppola.

106
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,433
Guess Scala.
The sentence means the market is in the 

107
00:05:22,391 --> 00:05:23,224
center of town.
Toady means market on is similar to his 

108
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:30,760
Kalpa me is town.
The end at the end of [inaudible] is the

109
00:05:30,761 --> 00:05:31,594
genitive case showing possession and 
then after Kelp lumion we have 

110
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:37,450
cascadilla which is the post position,
which means in the middle,

111
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:41,320
so it's supposed to position because it 
comes after the now Kalpa me next,

112
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:44,350
lots of grammatical cases,
15 to be precise.

113
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,393
That means that now it's personal 
pronouns and adjectives have 15 

114
00:05:47,531 --> 00:05:50,110
different forms depending on their 
function in the sentence.

115
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:53,200
We can't look at all 15 right now,
but let's look at an example.

116
00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:54,123
Finish has the accusative case which 
marks a direct object and that's common 

117
00:05:57,891 --> 00:05:58,790
in lots of languages.

118
00:05:58,940 --> 00:05:59,773
It can be shown with an end at the end 
of the word or it can be shown with 

119
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:04,730
nothing just left blank at the end of 
the word,

120
00:06:04,970 --> 00:06:07,190
but there is also something called the 
positive case.

121
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:11,810
This also marks a direct object.
If the object is only part of a whole or

122
00:06:11,811 --> 00:06:15,710
if the action is incomplete or if the 
action is negative shift,

123
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:20,300
go call on this sentence means will you 
eat the fish should means you eat.

124
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:21,620
Cool.
Here's a question.

125
00:06:21,621 --> 00:06:22,454
Marker.
Color is fish and the end at the end of 

126
00:06:24,681 --> 00:06:25,514
color is the accusative case showing 
that the action will be completed and 

127
00:06:28,311 --> 00:06:32,510
that the whole fish will be eaten.
Just cacala means do you eat fish?

128
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,190
So again,
shoot is you eat,

129
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:35,660
cook,
it's the question marker.

130
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:36,733
Color is fish and the [inaudible] at the
end of color is the positive case which 

131
00:06:40,431 --> 00:06:42,470
shows that there's no completed action.

132
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:46,220
There's no completed action because 
there's no specific fish being eaten.

133
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:48,440
This is just a general question.
Next,

134
00:06:48,530 --> 00:06:51,830
you may have noticed in the above 
example sentences that the present tense

135
00:06:51,831 --> 00:06:54,730
and future tense are the same.
That's right in finished.

136
00:06:54,731 --> 00:06:55,564
There is no future tense,
but the future can be indicated in a 

137
00:06:58,131 --> 00:06:58,964
couple of ways.
When you see a present tense verb with 

138
00:07:00,731 --> 00:07:01,564
an accusative case object like this that
indicates the future because it shows 

139
00:07:05,361 --> 00:07:07,550
that the action will be complete at some
point.

140
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,330
When you see a present tense verb with 
the part of the case like this,

141
00:07:11,690 --> 00:07:15,350
that indicates present tense because the
action is not a completed action,

142
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:16,213
so what must be happening now?
The future can also be clarified with a 

143
00:07:19,011 --> 00:07:19,844
time expression.
Here's an example of demonstrating that 

144
00:07:21,801 --> 00:07:24,080
there is no future tense in Finnish 
fluid.

145
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:26,990
This means I read one woman.

146
00:07:27,470 --> 00:07:30,850
This means I will read to moral who am 
in not means tomorrow,

147
00:07:31,010 --> 00:07:31,843
and that time expression is what 
indicates that this action will take 

148
00:07:34,041 --> 00:07:35,480
place in the future.
Next,

149
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:36,613
there are a lot of long words and finish
because of a gluten nation and because 

150
00:07:39,231 --> 00:07:42,200
of compound words finishes in a gluten 
native language,

151
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:43,063
meaning that words can be formed by 
attaching together pieces that add 

152
00:07:45,621 --> 00:07:48,290
meaning to the word.
Without those pieces changing,

153
00:07:48,410 --> 00:07:49,243
you just attach them together.
In English we might use separate words 

154
00:07:51,711 --> 00:07:52,544
like conjunctions and prepositions,
but in finished special endings can be 

155
00:07:55,401 --> 00:07:58,610
added to a word stem.
Here's an example starting with the word

156
00:07:58,611 --> 00:07:59,444
for house.

157
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:01,590
Hello.
Hello Sir.

158
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:05,900
Hello,
is sonny boy's soon again.

159
00:08:06,630 --> 00:08:07,590
Hello.
So Nikki go

160
00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:11,730
and the few additional features of 
finish.

161
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,490
Number one,
the main stress always goes on the first

162
00:08:14,491 --> 00:08:16,440
syllable of the word.
Number two,

163
00:08:16,441 --> 00:08:19,380
there was no equivalent of the verb to 
have in finish.

164
00:08:19,590 --> 00:08:22,170
Number three finish has negative verb 
conjugations.

165
00:08:22,171 --> 00:08:25,260
That means that instead of using a 
negation word like not,

166
00:08:25,410 --> 00:08:28,740
it has an entirely different form of the
verb to show that it's negative.

167
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:29,673
Finish is clearly a very interesting 
language that might be quite different 

168
00:08:32,041 --> 00:08:34,290
from the languages that you're used to 
speaking and learning.

169
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:36,750
But it's finished as hard to learn as 
people say it is.

170
00:08:36,810 --> 00:08:37,643
Well,
I can't tell you from personal 

171
00:08:38,161 --> 00:08:38,994
experience,
but it seems to me that if you've never 

172
00:08:40,171 --> 00:08:41,004
learned a language from the finet group,
we're from the your relic language 

173
00:08:43,231 --> 00:08:44,064
family before,
then you'll probably have to bend your 

174
00:08:45,751 --> 00:08:49,410
mind a little bit to understand how that
language works and that'll probably take

175
00:08:49,411 --> 00:08:50,244
more focus and effort then learning a 
language that's more similar to your 

176
00:08:52,741 --> 00:08:54,570
own,
but as is always the case,

177
00:08:54,571 --> 00:08:55,404
your passion,
any language or culture will carry you 

178
00:08:56,941 --> 00:08:58,890
through the challenges of learning that 
language.

179
00:08:58,891 --> 00:09:01,770
So if you're fascinated by finished,
you really should go for it.

180
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:02,813
Okay.
The question of the day for finished 

181
00:09:03,751 --> 00:09:04,584
speakers,
how noticeable or the finished dialects 

182
00:09:06,061 --> 00:09:06,894
today,
can you tell where a finished speaker 

183
00:09:07,981 --> 00:09:08,814
was from just by hearing them speak and 
a different question for people who've 

184
00:09:11,391 --> 00:09:14,040
studied finish,
how challenging is finished to learn?

185
00:09:14,041 --> 00:09:16,620
Did you find it quite tough or did you 
just find it different?

186
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:17,573
Let us know in the comments down below.
Thanks again to all my patrion 

187
00:09:20,371 --> 00:09:22,890
supporters for your continued support 
and everyone else.

188
00:09:22,891 --> 00:09:25,220
Thank you for watching and have a nice.
