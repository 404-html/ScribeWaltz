1
00:00:00,970 --> 00:00:01,803
Ooh.

2
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:03,133
Hello everyone.
Welcome to the Lange Focus Channel and 

3
00:00:04,791 --> 00:00:05,624
my name is Paul.
Today I'm going to be remaking a video 

4
00:00:08,031 --> 00:00:08,864
that I made back in the early days of 
this channel because well a lot of the 

5
00:00:11,691 --> 00:00:12,524
data in that video is wrong.
The topic is the 10 most widely spoken 

6
00:00:16,701 --> 00:00:19,610
languages in the world.
We can measure the number of speakers or

7
00:00:19,611 --> 00:00:20,444
language has by looking either at native
speakers or by looking at the total 

8
00:00:23,271 --> 00:00:25,670
number of speakers including second 
language speakers.

9
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:26,743
First we'll look at the number of native
speakers for each language and later on 

10
00:00:29,421 --> 00:00:30,254
we'll include second language speakers 
and see how the numbers change based on 

11
00:00:32,931 --> 00:00:33,764
the number of native speakers.
The most widely spoken language in the 

12
00:00:35,841 --> 00:00:40,190
world is Mandarin.
It has somewhere between 900,000,950

13
00:00:40,191 --> 00:00:41,024
5 million native speakers.
That makes it the most widely spoken 

14
00:00:43,791 --> 00:00:45,980
native language in the world.
By far,

15
00:00:46,190 --> 00:00:47,023
mandarin is the most widely spoken of 
the Chinese languages and it's the 

16
00:00:49,491 --> 00:00:51,860
official language of China and Taiwan.

17
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:55,880
The number of native speakers does not 
include native speakers of other Chinese

18
00:00:55,881 --> 00:00:57,350
languages,
only have Mandarin.

19
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:58,393
Number two is Spanish.
With somewhere between 405 million and 

20
00:01:01,371 --> 00:01:05,390
470 million native speakers depending on
which source you consult.

21
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:06,433
Number two used to be English,
but the number of native Spanish 

22
00:01:08,751 --> 00:01:09,584
speakers has been growing much more 
quickly than the number of native 

23
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:15,380
English speakers in recent years.
And that brings us to number three which

24
00:01:15,381 --> 00:01:18,680
is English with around 360 million 
native speakers.

25
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:22,220
And an interesting side note on my 
previous version of this video,

26
00:01:22,221 --> 00:01:23,054
I got a lot of comments saying there's 
no way that the number is that low 

27
00:01:25,641 --> 00:01:29,630
because the population of the United 
States alone is about 320 million.

28
00:01:29,870 --> 00:01:32,780
Well keep in mind that a lot of people 
in the United States,

29
00:01:32,781 --> 00:01:33,614
a very large percentage of the 
population are actually immigrants who 

30
00:01:35,811 --> 00:01:37,850
do not speak English as their first 
language.

31
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:41,060
And that's also true of other countries 
where English is the main language.

32
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:41,953
Number four is Hindu standing,
meaning Hindi and Urdu with around 355 

33
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:46,783
million native speakers.
Hindi and Urdu are spoken in the Indian 

34
00:01:49,041 --> 00:01:49,874
subcontinent,
in India and Pakistan and they are very 

35
00:01:52,101 --> 00:01:52,934
similar in their spoken forms.
And they can be considered one language 

36
00:01:55,790 --> 00:01:58,190
even though they're literary forms are 
quite different.

37
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:01,820
For more information on Hindustan each 
check out my video on that subject right

38
00:02:01,821 --> 00:02:02,654
here.
Number five as Arabic with around 293 

39
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:07,183
million native speakers.
Now I should note that Arabic has many 

40
00:02:09,591 --> 00:02:12,830
different spoken varieties,
many different dialects and some of them

41
00:02:12,831 --> 00:02:16,400
are harder to understand than others.
Some of them are kind of unintelligible.

42
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:18,050
For example,
Moroccan Arabic,

43
00:02:18,051 --> 00:02:18,884
lots of people from other Arabic 
countries say it's hard to understand 

44
00:02:21,171 --> 00:02:22,004
them,
but Arabic does have a standard 

45
00:02:23,601 --> 00:02:24,434
language.
Standard Arabic unites all of the 

46
00:02:25,731 --> 00:02:26,564
different dialects and people can use it
to communicate with speakers of the 

47
00:02:29,451 --> 00:02:30,284
other dialects.
So even though some of those dialects 

48
00:02:31,881 --> 00:02:32,714
are fairly different,
they can be considered one language and 

49
00:02:34,641 --> 00:02:39,410
if we include all varieties of Arabic,
there are 293 million native speakers.

50
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:44,390
Number six is Portuguese was somewhere 
between 215,000,220

51
00:02:44,391 --> 00:02:45,224
5 million native speakers.
A lot of people are surprised to hear 

52
00:02:47,541 --> 00:02:48,374
that Portuguese is on this list,
but remember Portuguese is not only the 

53
00:02:51,021 --> 00:02:53,960
language of Portugal,
it's also spoken in Brazil,

54
00:02:53,961 --> 00:02:54,794
which has a population of 200 million.
Number seven is Bengali with around 206 

55
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:00,273
native speakers,
mostly living in Bangladesh and in some 

56
00:03:02,411 --> 00:03:03,244
of the eastern provinces of India.
Number eight is Russian with around 155 

57
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:08,373
million native speakers.
Number nine is Japanese with around 126 

58
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:12,813
million native speakers.
Number 10 is Punjabi with around 102 

59
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:19,510
million native speakers.
It is spoken mainly in western India and

60
00:03:19,511 --> 00:03:20,830
in Pakistan.
In fact,

61
00:03:20,831 --> 00:03:21,664
it's the most widely spoken native 
language in Pakistan even though it's 

62
00:03:23,981 --> 00:03:27,220
not the official language there.
Those were the top 10 languages based on

63
00:03:27,221 --> 00:03:28,054
the number of native speakers,
but the situation is somewhat different 

64
00:03:30,581 --> 00:03:31,414
if we include second language speakers,
that's because some languages are much 

65
00:03:34,271 --> 00:03:38,050
more widely spoken as a Lingua Franca 
than they are as a native language.

66
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:41,590
So let's see what the list looks like if
we include non native speakers.

67
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:42,483
Number one is English.
English has a lot fewer native speakers 

68
00:03:44,981 --> 00:03:45,814
than Mandarin Chinese does,
but if we include all the people around 

69
00:03:48,011 --> 00:03:48,844
the world who learned English as a 
second language or as a foreign 

70
00:03:50,741 --> 00:03:53,800
language,
that brings the numbers up to around 1.4

71
00:03:53,801 --> 00:03:55,900
to 1.5
billion speakers.

72
00:03:55,990 --> 00:03:58,930
Some people estimate the number to be as
high as 2 billion,

73
00:03:58,990 --> 00:03:59,823
but of course there is some disagreement
about what level of proficiency is 

74
00:04:02,471 --> 00:04:05,500
necessary in order to be included as a 
speaker of English.

75
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:08,290
English is the defacto Global Lingua 
Franca,

76
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:10,240
the international language,
sorry,

77
00:04:10,241 --> 00:04:11,074
Esperanto lovers number two is mandarin 
with somewhere between one point 

78
00:04:14,411 --> 00:04:17,170
1000000001.1
5 billion speakers.

79
00:04:17,171 --> 00:04:21,280
If we include the 119 million people who
have learned it as a second language,

80
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:22,263
those people are mostly in China and 
mostly speakers of other Chinese 

81
00:04:24,881 --> 00:04:25,714
languages.
Number three is Spanish with somewhere 

82
00:04:28,331 --> 00:04:29,640
between 500 million.

83
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:30,473
That 570 million speakers.
There are about 90 million people who 

84
00:04:33,551 --> 00:04:34,384
speak Spanish as a second language 
including linguistic minorities and a 

85
00:04:37,121 --> 00:04:37,954
lot of Spanish speaking countries and 
there are also a lot of people who 

86
00:04:40,121 --> 00:04:40,954
learned Spanish as a foreign language.
Number four is Hindu standing with 

87
00:04:43,561 --> 00:04:44,394
around 514 million speakers.
That means that there are about 

88
00:04:47,381 --> 00:04:52,381
200000002nd language speakers of him 
understanding Hindi and Urdu function as

89
00:04:52,481 --> 00:04:53,314
Lingua Franca is in much of northern 
India and in Pakistan in Pakistan for 

90
00:04:56,561 --> 00:05:00,670
example or do a spoken as a second 
language by around 94 million people and

91
00:05:00,671 --> 00:05:03,970
it's only the native language of around 
9% of the population.

92
00:05:04,210 --> 00:05:08,080
Number five was Arabic with around 422 
million speakers.

93
00:05:08,081 --> 00:05:12,490
That means that there are around 
130000002nd language speakers of Arabic.

94
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:13,533
A lot of these people are non Arabs 
living in countries where Arabic is an 

95
00:05:16,121 --> 00:05:17,470
official language.
For example,

96
00:05:17,471 --> 00:05:19,960
many speakers of the Berber language is 
in North Africa.

97
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:21,670
Learn Arabic as a second language.

98
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:22,533
Varieties of Arabic are also used as 
Lingua Franca us throughout different 

99
00:05:25,151 --> 00:05:25,984
parts of Africa.
Number six is a Russian with around 260 

100
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:29,973
million speakers.
Russian jumped from number eight on the 

101
00:05:31,661 --> 00:05:32,494
first list to number six on this list.
That's because Russian is widely spoken 

102
00:05:35,321 --> 00:05:38,290
as a Lingua Franca throughout much of 
the former Soviet Union.

103
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:41,590
For more information on Russian,
check out my video on that subject right

104
00:05:41,591 --> 00:05:42,424
here.
Number seven is Portuguese with between 

105
00:05:45,191 --> 00:05:46,024
250 million and 260 million speakers.
There are about 35000002nd language 

106
00:05:50,921 --> 00:05:51,754
speakers of Portuguese,
mainly in African countries like Angola 

107
00:05:54,401 --> 00:05:55,234
and Mozambique countries where 
Portuguese is the former colonial 

108
00:05:57,411 --> 00:05:58,244
language.
Today there are some native speakers 

109
00:05:59,331 --> 00:06:00,164
living in those countries,
but Portuguese is also used as a Lingua 

110
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:04,640
Franca between the diverse linguistic 
communities.

111
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:05,623
Number eight is a language that didn't 
even appear on our original top 10 list 

112
00:06:08,661 --> 00:06:11,390
and that is the Malay language including
Indonesia,

113
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:12,830
which is a variety of Malai.

114
00:06:13,010 --> 00:06:13,843
It is spoken by around 77 million people
as a native language and there are an 

115
00:06:17,031 --> 00:06:17,864
additional 173000002nd language speakers
for a total of 250 million speakers of 

116
00:06:23,601 --> 00:06:26,690
Malaysia and Indonesia.
One of the reasons that it has spoken so

117
00:06:26,691 --> 00:06:30,650
much more widely as a second language is
because it is widely learned as a second

118
00:06:30,651 --> 00:06:33,350
language in Indonesia.
There it is the official language,

119
00:06:33,351 --> 00:06:34,184
but it's mainly used as a lingua franca 
because there are hundreds of languages 

120
00:06:36,801 --> 00:06:37,634
spoken in Indonesia.
Number nine is Bengali with around 226 

121
00:06:40,850 --> 00:06:41,683
million speakers and number 10 is French
or another language that didn't appear 

122
00:06:44,181 --> 00:06:45,014
on our original top 10 list.
While French has around 80 million 

123
00:06:47,421 --> 00:06:48,254
native speakers,
there are around 140 million second 

124
00:06:50,331 --> 00:06:53,420
language speakers for a total of about 
220 million.

125
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:56,810
The majority of those speakers are in 
Africa where French is spoken and around

126
00:06:56,811 --> 00:06:57,644
31 different countries.
Some researchers project that the 

127
00:06:59,781 --> 00:07:00,614
Francophone population will be as high 
as 500 million in the year 2025 and 700 

128
00:07:05,810 --> 00:07:09,200
million in the year 2050 so which list 
do you think is more meaningful?

129
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:12,980
I tend to think that the second list is 
more meaningful because in my opinion,

130
00:07:13,130 --> 00:07:17,090
the importance of a language depends on 
how many people use it for communication

131
00:07:17,091 --> 00:07:17,924
and not on how many people speak it 
perfectly and with the perfect native 

132
00:07:20,361 --> 00:07:21,194
accent and I think that another thing 
that makes a language important is how 

133
00:07:23,931 --> 00:07:25,850
many countries that is spoken in 
andover,

134
00:07:25,851 --> 00:07:28,160
how wide of a geographic area that has 
spoken.

135
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,233
I think we have to balance these two 
different factors in order to determine 

136
00:07:31,611 --> 00:07:32,444
how important the language is.
So even though Mandarin has the largest 

137
00:07:35,001 --> 00:07:35,834
number of native speakers and even 
though it has the second largest number 

138
00:07:38,121 --> 00:07:38,954
of total speakers,
it might not be the most important or 

139
00:07:41,271 --> 00:07:43,190
second most important language in the 
world.

140
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:44,233
The most important language in the world
is right now clearly English because it 

141
00:07:47,121 --> 00:07:49,640
is widely spoken by so many people 
around the world.

142
00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:50,743
I would say that number two is Spanish 
because it's spoken by a large 

143
00:07:52,941 --> 00:07:56,060
population and it's spoken in dozens of 
countries around the world.

144
00:07:56,210 --> 00:07:59,000
And because the Spanish speaking 
population is growing quickly,

145
00:07:59,150 --> 00:07:59,983
I would say that French might be another
one in the top five because of it's 

146
00:08:02,301 --> 00:08:06,200
fairly large total number of speakers 
because it's widely spoken in Europe and

147
00:08:06,201 --> 00:08:07,034
in Africa.
And because of the projected growth in 

148
00:08:08,541 --> 00:08:09,374
the francophone population,
another might be Arabic because it's 

149
00:08:11,661 --> 00:08:12,494
spoken throughout many countries in the 
Middle East and North Africa and by a 

150
00:08:14,991 --> 00:08:17,390
growing population in Europe and around 
the world.

151
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:18,373
And another one is probably Chinese,
even though it's not an official 

152
00:08:20,631 --> 00:08:21,464
language in many places,
China is an important country with a 

153
00:08:23,751 --> 00:08:24,584
huge population and a large economy and 
Chinese might become more important in 

154
00:08:28,011 --> 00:08:29,900
the future.
So the question of the day is,

155
00:08:29,901 --> 00:08:32,480
what do you think,
what are the most important languages in

156
00:08:32,481 --> 00:08:33,314
the world?
