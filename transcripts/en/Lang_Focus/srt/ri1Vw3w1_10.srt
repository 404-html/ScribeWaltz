00:00:08,330 --> 00:00:09,163
Hello everyone.
Welcome to the Lange Focus Channel and 

4
00:00:11,001 --> 00:00:14,570
my name is Paul.
Today's topic is the Celtic languages.

5
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:15,793
Celtic languages are today spoken mainly
in the British isles where they've 

6
00:00:18,441 --> 00:00:21,110
existed alongside English since the 
Middle Ages.

7
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:22,693
The numbers are not exactly clear 
because the Celtic languages have gone 

8
00:00:25,251 --> 00:00:28,940
through declines and revivals and people
have varying degrees of ability,

9
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:30,980
so we'll take these numbers with a grain
of salt,

10
00:00:31,310 --> 00:00:34,910
but there are around a million speakers 
of Celtic languages in total.

11
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:40,330
That includes Welsh with around 508,000
speakers and around 310,000

12
00:00:40,941 --> 00:00:41,774
fluent speakers mainly in Wales.
Then there's Irish Gaelic which has 

13
00:00:45,831 --> 00:00:46,664
around 80,000
proficient speakers who use it outside 

14
00:00:48,681 --> 00:00:49,514
of school,
but around 2 million people have at 

15
00:00:50,871 --> 00:00:51,704
least some knowledge of it mainly in 
Ireland and to some extent in Northern 

16
00:00:54,830 --> 00:00:55,663
Ireland.
Then they're Scottish Gaelic which has 

17
00:00:57,081 --> 00:01:00,680
around 57,000
native speakers and around 87,000

18
00:01:00,681 --> 00:01:03,560
people with some knowledge of the 
language mainly in Scotland.

19
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:07,730
There is also a small Scottish Gaelic 
community of around 2,300

20
00:01:07,731 --> 00:01:10,400
people in Cape Breton Nova Scotia in 
Canada.

21
00:01:11,570 --> 00:01:15,260
Then there's the Breton language spoken 
by around 226,000

22
00:01:15,261 --> 00:01:17,750
people,
mainly in the Brittany region of France,

23
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:22,400
that figure of 226,000
include students in bilingual schools.

24
00:01:22,670 --> 00:01:25,190
Then there's the cornish language spoken
in Cornwall,

25
00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:28,010
which came close to extinction in the 
19th century,

26
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:28,873
but has undergone a revival and now has 
a few thousand fluent speakers and then 

27
00:01:33,171 --> 00:01:35,690
there's the manx language spoken on the 
Isle of Man,

28
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:36,553
which has only around a hundred native 
speakers and a couple thousand people 

29
00:01:39,171 --> 00:01:40,004
who can speak some makes today.
They're not spoken by a very large 

30
00:01:42,801 --> 00:01:43,634
number of people and they're mostly 
limited to the British isles and to 

31
00:01:45,951 --> 00:01:46,784
Brittany in France,
but historically the Celtic languages 

32
00:01:48,861 --> 00:01:51,980
were spoken over a much larger area than
they are today.

33
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:53,263
During the first millennium bce.
They were spoken across much of Europe 

34
00:01:56,030 --> 00:01:56,863
from the Iberian Peninsula all the way 
over to the Black Sea and even in parts 

35
00:01:59,961 --> 00:02:00,830
of Asia Minor.

36
00:02:00,890 --> 00:02:01,723
One probable Prodo Celtic culture was 
the earned field culture of central 

37
00:02:04,971 --> 00:02:08,570
Europe in the late Bronze Age.
It was a flourishing culture from around

38
00:02:08,571 --> 00:02:09,404
1200 bce.
It's language was at least likely an 

39
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:14,380
early form of Celtic,
if not protocol t,

40
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:17,180
and we think so partly based on place 
name evidence,

41
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:18,223
protal Celtic developed into various 
Celtic languages which were spoken over 

42
00:02:21,111 --> 00:02:21,944
a wide area in Europe.
The earliest attested tested Celtic 

43
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:25,880
languages.
The pontic language,

44
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:29,930
the language of the goal of culture that
descended from the earned field culture.

45
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:30,853
There are about 140 the pontic 
inscriptions that were discovered in 

46
00:02:33,801 --> 00:02:34,634
northern Italy and southern Switzerland.
These inscriptions date from around 550 

47
00:02:38,421 --> 00:02:39,254
bce to 100 bce.
The gullah culture had strong 

48
00:02:42,321 --> 00:02:44,810
connections with the neighboring house.
That culture,

49
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:48,800
the major celtic culture at that time,
these languages on the European mainland

50
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:49,663
and in Asia Minor,
I'll refer to as the continental 

51
00:02:51,621 --> 00:02:52,454
languages.

52
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:55,220
This is a geographic grouping,
not a linguistic one,

53
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:56,083
and there are no particular linguistic 
innovations that would make them a 

54
00:02:58,461 --> 00:02:59,294
linguistic.
Here are some continental Celtic 

55
00:03:00,971 --> 00:03:01,804
languages that might ring a bell.
There's the goldfish language spoken in 

56
00:03:04,401 --> 00:03:05,234
dl within Presente de France and 
Galician spoken in Asia minor around 

57
00:03:09,791 --> 00:03:10,750
present day,
Ankara,

58
00:03:10,751 --> 00:03:14,170
Turkey.
The continental Celtic languages are all

59
00:03:14,171 --> 00:03:15,004
extinct.
Celtic speakers began to die out or 

60
00:03:16,901 --> 00:03:17,734
become assimilated into the Roman 
culture by around 200 bce before the 

61
00:03:21,821 --> 00:03:24,400
death and assimilation of Celtic 
speakers on the mainland,

62
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:27,040
some Celtic speakers migrated to the 
British isles.

63
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:27,933
The Celtic languages that developed in 
the British isles are known as the 

64
00:03:30,251 --> 00:03:31,084
insular Celtic languages.
The insular Celtic languages are still 

65
00:03:33,731 --> 00:03:34,564
alive today.
There are two groups of insular Celtic 

66
00:03:36,311 --> 00:03:39,250
languages,
Cute Celtic or Goy Delek languages which

67
00:03:39,251 --> 00:03:40,750
include Irish,
Scottish,

68
00:03:40,751 --> 00:03:45,751
and makes Gaelic and the PA Celtic or 
nick languages which include Breton,

69
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:47,200
cornish,
and Welsh.

70
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:51,130
These two groups of insular Celtic 
languages are not intelligible with each

71
00:03:51,131 --> 00:03:51,964
other,
but within each group there is some 

72
00:03:53,021 --> 00:03:56,140
degree of intelligibility depending on 
the dialect being spoken.

73
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:57,333
The two groups of insular Celtic 
languages evolved from a common 

74
00:03:59,741 --> 00:04:03,070
ancestor.
The oldest known insular Celtic language

75
00:04:03,071 --> 00:04:06,880
is a form of Archaic Irish,
sometimes called Primitive Irish.

76
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:07,893
It is found in the argument scriptions 
from the early fourth century CE 

77
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:13,690
organism,
an alphabet that was used to write Irish

78
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:18,100
as a group from primitive Irish into old
Irish and was used until about the ninth

79
00:04:18,101 --> 00:04:18,934
century.
Old Irish eventually developed into the 

80
00:04:20,921 --> 00:04:21,754
modern Irish Gaelic up today.
Speakers of old Irish also migrated to 

81
00:04:25,781 --> 00:04:26,614
Scotland where it eventually developed 
into Scottish Gaelic and to the Isle of 

82
00:04:30,761 --> 00:04:34,660
man where it evolved into banks.
While primitive Irish,

83
00:04:34,661 --> 00:04:37,320
a rosen,
Ireland common [inaudible] Rosen,

84
00:04:37,330 --> 00:04:40,360
Great Britain.
Common Bottleneck is the ancestor of all

85
00:04:40,361 --> 00:04:42,640
the PA,
Celtic or [inaudible] languages.

86
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:43,803
The pick dish language which went 
extinct by the twelfth century Ce may 

87
00:04:46,901 --> 00:04:47,734
have been a sonic language,
but it's possible that pick dish was 

88
00:04:49,991 --> 00:04:52,390
related to sonic but not descended from 
it.

89
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:56,410
Over the course of a few centuries,
protonic dialects evolved into Welsh,

90
00:04:56,411 --> 00:04:57,640
cornish,
Breton,

91
00:04:57,730 --> 00:04:59,560
and come brick,
which is extinct.

92
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:03,040
The Celtic languages were under great 
pressure during this time.

93
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:08,110
Breton is in fact spoken in continental 
Europe in the Brittany region of France,

94
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:10,120
even though it's an insular Celtic 
language.

95
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:13,330
It has been spoken there since the sixth
century CE,

96
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:17,260
when some Celtic speakers fled during 
the Anglo Saxon invasion of Britain.

97
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:19,053
Coexistence with English Britain was 
ruled by the Romans from 43 Ce to 410 

98
00:05:23,861 --> 00:05:26,290
seat,
but after the departure of the Romans,

99
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:28,630
the Anglo saxons began to invade 
Britain.

100
00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:29,823
In Britain,
the Anglo saxons conquered the Celtic 

101
00:05:31,421 --> 00:05:34,300
peoples and either eliminated them or 
intermarried with them,

102
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:35,163
depending on the source,
you consult eventually replacing the 

103
00:05:37,121 --> 00:05:40,660
Celtic languages with old English,
but not in Wales and Cornwall,

104
00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:43,330
which remained Celtic in Scotland.

105
00:05:43,450 --> 00:05:47,470
Gaelic speakers from Ireland migrated to
the west coast around the same time that

106
00:05:47,471 --> 00:05:52,471
Anglo saxons migrated to the east coast.
Then Scottish Gaelic began to develop in

107
00:05:52,721 --> 00:05:53,554
Scotland,
Gaelic coexisted with the old English 

108
00:05:55,511 --> 00:05:59,060
dialects that would later develop into 
Scotts and Scotts English,

109
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:02,930
and in the year 17 or seven,
Scotland formed a union with England and

110
00:06:02,931 --> 00:06:04,760
Wales,
the Kingdom of Great Britain.

111
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:05,893
After that,
Scottish Gaelic began to diminish and 

112
00:06:07,671 --> 00:06:11,030
use partly because English was the 
language of universal education.

113
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:16,330
Scottish Gaelic is today considered 
definitely endangered by UNESCO as World

114
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:19,790
Language Project Wales came under the 
control of England in the year 12,

115
00:06:19,791 --> 00:06:20,624
82.
Welsh has continued to be spoken until 

116
00:06:22,581 --> 00:06:24,440
the present day,
but for a long time.

117
00:06:24,470 --> 00:06:25,303
English was given preference as the 
official language and in the 19th and 

118
00:06:28,161 --> 00:06:28,994
20th centuries,
Welsh declined rapidly in favor of 

119
00:06:31,281 --> 00:06:32,114
English,
but efforts have been made to conserve 

120
00:06:33,711 --> 00:06:34,544
the Welsh language and everybody learns 
at least some of it in school and some 

121
00:06:37,551 --> 00:06:40,370
people take their entire public school 
education in Welsh,

122
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:41,353
and as I mentioned before,
it currently has hundreds of thousands 

123
00:06:43,341 --> 00:06:44,270
of native speakers.

124
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:47,600
Cornwall was under English control by 
the mid 19th century.

125
00:06:47,690 --> 00:06:51,950
Their language began to disappear after 
England passed the act of uniformity and

126
00:06:51,951 --> 00:06:52,970
15,
58.

127
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:56,750
This was a law that made English the 
sole language of church services.

128
00:06:56,810 --> 00:06:57,643
The cornish language almost became 
extinct and it was actually a 

129
00:07:00,001 --> 00:07:00,834
temporarily declared extinct by UNESCO,
but a revival movement in the 20th 

130
00:07:04,731 --> 00:07:05,564
century has given new life to the 
language and it is now taught in some 

131
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:08,864
schools and there are now about 300 
fluent cornish speakers on the isle of 

132
00:07:12,321 --> 00:07:13,154
Man.
The manx language is in a similar 

133
00:07:14,331 --> 00:07:16,490
situation.
It almost became extinct,

134
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:17,383
but a revival movement has resulted in a
few hundred fluent speakers of the 

135
00:07:20,271 --> 00:07:21,104
language.
There is also a manx language primary 

136
00:07:22,851 --> 00:07:23,684
school.
They're creating a new generation of 

137
00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:25,694
make speakers.
Ireland became an English colony from 

138
00:07:27,711 --> 00:07:28,544
1169 to 1949.
Irish remained the majority language 

139
00:07:32,151 --> 00:07:35,420
there until the 19th century when it was
overtaken by English.

140
00:07:35,690 --> 00:07:39,170
Despite strong intentions to support and
revive the Irish language,

141
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:41,660
it continues to decline in favor of 
English.

142
00:07:41,690 --> 00:07:42,523
It is taught in schools,
but not many people use the language of 

143
00:07:44,751 --> 00:07:48,320
their own volition outside of schools 
and similar to Scottish Gaelic,

144
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:49,173
it is considered definitely endangered.
The Brittany region became part of 

145
00:07:53,751 --> 00:07:56,570
France in the 16th century.
In France.

146
00:07:56,571 --> 00:07:59,630
There is no official recognition of any 
regional languages.

147
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:00,673
The majority of Breton speakers today 
are in their sixties or older and the 

148
00:08:03,711 --> 00:08:06,270
number of speakers could be dropping by 
$10,000

149
00:08:06,271 --> 00:08:07,104
per year.
It is considered severely endangered by 

150
00:08:09,051 --> 00:08:09,884
UNESCO.
Now let's look at some features of 

151
00:08:12,261 --> 00:08:16,220
Celtic languages in general.
Celtic languages feature vsl,

152
00:08:16,221 --> 00:08:17,054
word order.
Actually Continental Celtic languages 

153
00:08:18,951 --> 00:08:19,784
probably had freer word order,
but let's focus on the Living Celtic 

154
00:08:22,551 --> 00:08:25,010
languages.
Here's an example of vsl word order.

155
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:25,873
In Irish Gaelic.
This sentence means I saw the man this 

156
00:08:28,131 --> 00:08:31,580
morning,
Honickman farrier margin word for word.

157
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:36,170
It's see past tense.
I the man on morning.

158
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:38,210
You can see that it's vs.
Oh,

159
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:39,133
another sentence.
This one means the man was painting a 

160
00:08:41,061 --> 00:08:41,894
chair yesterday.
He and Ferric Pancho cohere in a word 

161
00:08:45,111 --> 00:08:47,420
for word.
It's be in past tense.

162
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:51,770
The man,
progressive paint chair yesterday.

163
00:08:51,950 --> 00:08:52,783
You can see that it's vsl with the 
auxiliary verb coming in first position 

164
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:58,890
and the main lexical verb coming after 
the subject,

165
00:08:58,980 --> 00:08:59,813
and then there's the object next Celtic 
languages feature inflected 

166
00:09:03,661 --> 00:09:04,494
prepositions,
which are basically a combination of a 

167
00:09:06,331 --> 00:09:10,350
preposition and a personal pronoun.
Let's look at an example from Welsh.

168
00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:11,423
The preposition meaning on his ad and 
the stem that comes before inflections 

169
00:09:15,601 --> 00:09:20,601
is at,
so we have on me out of notch on us,

170
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:25,440
on you,
singular on you,

171
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:28,020
plural,
on him,

172
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:32,460
on her,
out of in on them,

173
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:33,833
out of a similar kind of inflected 
preposition exists in Semitic languages 

174
00:09:38,491 --> 00:09:39,690
like Hebrew and Arabic.

175
00:09:39,810 --> 00:09:43,590
Next Celtic languages feature initial 
consonant mutations.

176
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:46,530
That is a change in the consonant at the
beginning of a word,

177
00:09:46,531 --> 00:09:48,900
depending on its context.
For example,

178
00:09:48,930 --> 00:09:52,500
if the word is preceded by a definite 
article in the genitive case,

179
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:57,180
let's take a look at this in Irish,
so we have the word for men fair,

180
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,433
but if we want to say of the men,
it becomes unfair and it's similar for 

181
00:10:03,001 --> 00:10:05,460
the date of case.
If we want to say to the men,

182
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:10,520
it becomes to unfair,
the unfair.

183
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:14,430
It may be hard to hear a difference in 
that continent,

184
00:10:14,431 --> 00:10:17,850
but there is a sort of softening of the 
f sound in some dialects.

185
00:10:17,851 --> 00:10:21,750
That mutated consonant sounds something 
like a v sound in other dialects.

186
00:10:21,751 --> 00:10:26,310
It's silent not only continent 
mutations,

187
00:10:26,311 --> 00:10:30,810
but also vowel mutations occur in Celtic
languages as a morphological device.

188
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:31,733
Let's look at some examples from Welsh 
that will mutations can be used in 

189
00:10:34,831 --> 00:10:35,664
forming different parts of speech,
becomes a sold the noun hio meaning son 

190
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,410
becomes the adjective.

191
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:44,220
Hey,
look,

192
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:45,053
meaning Sunny Vale mutations can also be
used in the formation of a plural who 

193
00:10:49,410 --> 00:10:54,410
becomes a so the singular noun,
cool meaning boat becomes God,

194
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:58,200
meaning boats,
Celtic languages,

195
00:10:58,201 --> 00:11:02,760
also feature and impersonal verb form,
serving as a passive or in transitive.

196
00:11:03,210 --> 00:11:04,043
An example from Welsh discussion means I
teach the scared means is taught or one 

197
00:11:11,191 --> 00:11:12,024
teaches.
This is an impersonal verb that is not 

198
00:11:13,921 --> 00:11:17,720
conjugated for person.
An example from Irish Munoz,

199
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:20,730
I teach moon.
Cer is taught,

200
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:21,713
one teaches in English.
There was no specific verb form 

201
00:11:24,081 --> 00:11:24,914
dedicated to the passive.
You need to use an auxiliary verb plus 

202
00:11:27,391 --> 00:11:30,300
the past participle,
which has some other functions as well.

203
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:34,050
Differences between the PA Celtic 
languages and the q Celtic languages.

204
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:37,560
These two groups of languages have had 
thousands of years to divert,

205
00:11:37,561 --> 00:11:38,394
so there are a lot more differences 
between the two branches than there are 

206
00:11:40,861 --> 00:11:41,694
between the languages within them.
There are a lot of cognate words shared 

207
00:11:44,701 --> 00:11:45,534
between the two groups of languages,
but you could say that they are distant 

208
00:11:48,001 --> 00:11:48,834
cognates because sound changes and 
spelling changes have made the words 

209
00:11:51,631 --> 00:11:52,650
unrecognizable.

210
00:11:52,650 --> 00:11:54,280
In many cases,
the labels,

211
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:55,143
PA,
Celtic and q Celtic reflect the way 

212
00:11:56,561 --> 00:11:58,810
these two groups developed from Provo 
Celtic.

213
00:11:59,020 --> 00:11:59,853
If we look at the cognates that are 
shared between both branches in the PA 

214
00:12:03,070 --> 00:12:05,140
Celtic branch,
there are words that commonly begin with

215
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:06,430
P or b.
well,

216
00:12:06,431 --> 00:12:10,030
in the queue Celtic branch,
they begin with C or k or q.

217
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:12,700
for example.
The word for what in Irish,

218
00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:13,563
it's Cain and in Welsh it's bad.
There are some other common sound 

219
00:12:17,381 --> 00:12:18,970
differences too.
For example,

220
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:21,550
words beginning with s followed by e or 
I,

221
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:22,473
which make a shift sound.
In the Delek languages often begin with 

222
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:26,373
h in the languages,
so the word for old in Irish is Shan 

223
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:31,473
ended Welsh.
It's and despite their coexistence with 

224
00:12:35,410 --> 00:12:36,243
English over the centuries,
the Celtic languages are very distinct 

225
00:12:38,891 --> 00:12:39,724
from English and they're an important 
part of the history and the culture and 

226
00:12:42,251 --> 00:12:46,600
identity of the United Kingdom and 
Ireland as well as Brittany in France,

227
00:12:46,990 --> 00:12:51,310
but today most of the Celtic languages 
are considered to be endangered with the

228
00:12:51,311 --> 00:12:52,144
English language and French dominating 
whether the Celtic languages survive or 

229
00:12:55,361 --> 00:12:57,400
not,
depends on the communities to which they

230
00:12:57,401 --> 00:12:58,234
are native and that brings me to the 
question of the day for people from a 

231
00:13:01,211 --> 00:13:05,380
community where a Celtic language has 
traditionally been spoken to you speak a

232
00:13:05,381 --> 00:13:06,220
Celtic language.

233
00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:08,800
Do you speak that language outside of 
school?

234
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:12,220
How valuable do you think it is to be 
able to speak that language?

235
00:13:12,310 --> 00:13:15,120
