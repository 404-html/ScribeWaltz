00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,040
Follow lane focus on facebook,
twitter,

2
00:00:02,041 --> 00:00:02,910
and instagram.

3
00:00:03,770 --> 00:00:04,540
Okay.

4
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:05,373
Okay.
So the most commonly spoken romance 

5
00:00:06,491 --> 00:00:09,730
languages are of Spanish,
Portuguese,

6
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:11,230
French,
Italian.

7
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:12,490
Um,
that was one more,

8
00:00:12,491 --> 00:00:14,650
what was it?
Oh Micky.

9
00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:15,850
Stop that.
What are you doing?

10
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:17,673
Okay.
Anyway,

11
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:21,310
so the romance language just came from 
the Roman Empire,

12
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:23,200
the languages of Rome.
Um,

13
00:00:23,470 --> 00:00:25,450
what was it again?
Oh,

14
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:29,140
Mickey.
Mickey,

15
00:00:29,141 --> 00:00:30,340
what are you doing?
Give me that.

16
00:00:33,010 --> 00:00:33,850
Okay.
Anyway,

17
00:00:33,851 --> 00:00:38,851
so what was it?
Hello everyone.

18
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:43,530
Welcome to the Lange Focus Channel and 
my name is Paul.

19
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:48,590
Today's topic is the Romanian language 
or lean borrow mueller in Romanian.

20
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:53,190
As you can see the word Romanian 
contains the word Roman in it.

21
00:00:53,310 --> 00:00:54,143
Why?
Because it developed from the language 

22
00:00:55,381 --> 00:00:56,214
of the Romans Latin to clarify Romanian 
as a member of the romance language 

23
00:01:00,121 --> 00:01:02,370
family.
When speaking of romance languages,

24
00:01:02,371 --> 00:01:05,760
Romanian tends to get overlooked and I'm
guilty of that myself.

25
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:06,743
Maybe it's because of its geographic 
isolation from the other romance 

26
00:01:09,361 --> 00:01:10,170
languages.

27
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:11,003
You can see that the other major romance
languages are all spoken in western 

28
00:01:13,681 --> 00:01:14,514
Europe,
but Romanian has spoken in eastern 

29
00:01:15,841 --> 00:01:16,674
Europe and to separate it from the 
others by the Belkins and parts of 

30
00:01:18,901 --> 00:01:19,734
central Europe,
Romania and as part of the Eastern 

31
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:23,873
Romance Branch and there are other 
languages of this branch which are 

32
00:01:25,141 --> 00:01:27,690
spoken by minorities throughout 
southeastern Europe.

33
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:31,140
Notice that the names of these languages
contain the word Romanian.

34
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:33,900
These languages are all closely related 
to Romania.

35
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,033
Sometimes the word Romania is used to 
refer to all of these closely related 

36
00:01:38,191 --> 00:01:39,024
languages together and some eastern 
romance speakers consider them to be 

37
00:01:41,791 --> 00:01:42,624
dialects of one language.
The language of Romania and Moldova is 

38
00:01:45,571 --> 00:01:46,404
sometimes referred to as Dayco Romania 
to distinguish between it and the 

39
00:01:49,201 --> 00:01:51,480
others.
Dayco Romanian has the largest number of

40
00:01:51,481 --> 00:01:52,314
speakers out of all of those languages 
by far and at this video I'm basically 

41
00:01:55,291 --> 00:01:56,880
focusing on Dayco Romanian.

42
00:01:57,090 --> 00:01:57,923
Romanian is spoken by a route 24 million
native speakers and around 4000002nd 

43
00:02:02,131 --> 00:02:02,964
language speakers.
It is the official language of Romania 

44
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:09,750
where it is the mother tongue of around 
93% of the people or around 18.6

45
00:02:09,751 --> 00:02:12,810
million people as well as the official 
language of Moldova.

46
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:17,400
We're at spoken by around 2.7
5 million people in Moldova.

47
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:18,263
The language is referred to as muddle 
van by some people and as Romanian by 

48
00:02:21,601 --> 00:02:22,434
others.
Romanian is somewhat unique amongst the 

49
00:02:24,121 --> 00:02:28,230
romance languages because it developed 
in close contact with other languages,

50
00:02:28,231 --> 00:02:29,064
mainly the Slavic languages which have 
influenced its pronunciation and 

51
00:02:31,891 --> 00:02:34,860
vocabulary.
The closest romance language to Romanian

52
00:02:34,861 --> 00:02:35,694
is reportedly Italian,
which shares about 77% lexical 

53
00:02:38,881 --> 00:02:39,714
similarity with Romanian.
Compare that to 82% for Italian and 

54
00:02:42,961 --> 00:02:47,130
Spanish or 89% for Italian and French 
history.

55
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:48,263
The people living in the area before the
arrival of the Romans were known as the 

56
00:02:51,311 --> 00:02:54,770
dations or Dutchy and Romanian day.

57
00:02:54,770 --> 00:02:55,603
Shell was conquered by the Roman 
military in one oh six ce and the 

58
00:02:58,321 --> 00:03:00,970
population adopted the Latin language 
very quickly.

59
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,193
Exactly what happened is not clear.
Maybe the nation people simply adopted 

60
00:03:05,441 --> 00:03:09,400
the Latin language of their conquerors,
but it's also possible that the area was

61
00:03:09,401 --> 00:03:13,060
flooded with Roman settlers who 
intermarried with the local stations.

62
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:14,013
There's also the theory that the nation 
language was already an Italian 

63
00:03:16,391 --> 00:03:18,220
language,
closely related to Latin.

64
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:21,010
What is clear is that the area became 
very latinized.

65
00:03:21,011 --> 00:03:21,844
Very quickly.
The Roman Empire withdrew its military 

66
00:03:23,831 --> 00:03:24,664
from Daysha and two 71 to two 72 ce,
but left behind a romanized Latin 

67
00:03:29,201 --> 00:03:30,034
speaking population.
The next few centuries are fairly 

68
00:03:31,961 --> 00:03:32,794
mysterious,
but the local dialects of Latin 

69
00:03:34,121 --> 00:03:38,230
gradually evolved and sometime before 
the ninth century Prodo Romanian,

70
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:41,320
the ancestor of Romanian and all the 
eastern Romance Languages,

71
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:42,183
Oh rose,
there are different opinions about 

72
00:03:43,511 --> 00:03:47,630
whether protal Romanian developed from 
the vulgar Latin spoken by the romanized

73
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:48,483
station population or from a variety of 
vulgar Latin spoken by people south of 

74
00:03:52,061 --> 00:03:52,894
the Danube river,
who later migrated to the North Slavic 

75
00:03:55,391 --> 00:03:56,224
influence.

76
00:03:56,650 --> 00:04:00,580
Notice again that Romanian is surrounded
by mostly Slavic languages.

77
00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:03,760
That's because of the migration of 
Slavic speakers into the area.

78
00:04:03,761 --> 00:04:04,594
Between the seventh and ninth century CE
contact with Slavic speakers had an 

79
00:04:07,991 --> 00:04:08,824
influence on eastern romance,
particularly in vocabulary and 

80
00:04:11,201 --> 00:04:13,810
pronunciation but also in grammar and 
other areas.

81
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:17,710
It's fucked that many Slavic speakers 
adopted the local romance dialect,

82
00:04:17,711 --> 00:04:18,544
but because it was their second language
they spoke it with an accent and they 

83
00:04:21,221 --> 00:04:22,054
continue to use certain Slavic words 
that felt natural for them to keep 

84
00:04:24,731 --> 00:04:25,870
using.
Old Church.

85
00:04:25,871 --> 00:04:26,704
Slavonic must have also had an influence
on Romanian because it was the 

86
00:04:29,261 --> 00:04:30,094
administrative language until the 16th 
century and the liturgical language 

87
00:04:33,221 --> 00:04:34,054
until the 17th century.
It's hard to know exactly how Romanian 

88
00:04:36,881 --> 00:04:37,714
developed during the Middle Ages because
there are no existing Romanian texts 

89
00:04:40,811 --> 00:04:44,950
from before the 16th century.
The earliest Romanian text is niac shoes

90
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:45,784
letter,
which dates to 1521 it was written with 

91
00:04:48,341 --> 00:04:52,210
the Cyrillic alphabet which was used to 
write Romanian until the 19th century.

92
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:55,240
This is an obvious result of the Slavic 
influence on the language,

93
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,153
the modern period.
It's beyond the scope of this video to 

94
00:04:59,111 --> 00:04:59,944
go into detail about the history of 
Romania and the governments that ruled 

95
00:05:02,741 --> 00:05:03,574
over its different parts.
What's important for us to remember is 

96
00:05:05,591 --> 00:05:07,660
that despite changing borders and 
governments,

97
00:05:07,661 --> 00:05:08,494
there remained an ethnic and linguistic 
group that considered themselves 

98
00:05:10,811 --> 00:05:11,644
Romanian with a growing sense of 
Romanian national identity efforts to 

99
00:05:15,041 --> 00:05:18,220
standardize the Romanian language began 
in the 18th century.

100
00:05:18,670 --> 00:05:19,503
The first Romanian grammar was published
in 1780 in the 18 hundreds Romanian 

101
00:05:24,161 --> 00:05:24,994
linguists made a concerted effort to 
read Latin guys the language and remove 

102
00:05:28,101 --> 00:05:30,640
Slavic and other influences from the 
language.

103
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:34,180
And interestingly in replacing a lot of 
the non romance vocabulary,

104
00:05:34,181 --> 00:05:35,014
they drew words not only from Latin but 
also from Italian that especially from 

105
00:05:38,021 --> 00:05:38,854
French,
when Romania became an independent 

106
00:05:42,731 --> 00:05:46,450
country in 1878 it's official language 
became Romanian.

107
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:49,810
It's borders changed several times 
during the 20th century,

108
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:50,883
while Moldova spent much of the 20th 
century under Soviet rule as it gained 

109
00:05:54,581 --> 00:05:57,950
independence,
Moldova made Moldova in it's language.

110
00:05:58,130 --> 00:06:02,210
The consensus is that Romanian and 
Moldovan are a single language just with

111
00:06:02,211 --> 00:06:05,810
some regional variation.
The standard written language is exactly

112
00:06:05,811 --> 00:06:10,640
the same for both Romanian and Moldovan.
So how did this romance language survive

113
00:06:10,641 --> 00:06:13,220
in this area when most others didn't 
survive?

114
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:14,810
Well,
nobody really knows.

115
00:06:14,811 --> 00:06:15,644
But as I said before,
the area known as Daysha became 

116
00:06:17,511 --> 00:06:20,900
thoroughly latinized probably more than 
other areas in the region.

117
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:21,913
So whereas in other areas,
the Latin influence faded after the 

118
00:06:24,141 --> 00:06:28,130
departure of the Roman empire in Daysha 
that Latin influenced did not fade.

119
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:29,323
There are also various theories about 
the people fending off invaders better 

120
00:06:32,391 --> 00:06:33,224
than others or that the geography of 
their land insulated them from being 

121
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,490
overrun that assimilated.

122
00:06:37,910 --> 00:06:38,743
For example,
some say that the Carpathian mountains 

123
00:06:40,461 --> 00:06:41,294
provided a barrier for attack from the 
north and east or provided refuge and 

124
00:06:44,721 --> 00:06:47,330
strategic high ground above invaders.
But again,

125
00:06:47,331 --> 00:06:50,270
nobody really knows.
So what is Romanian like?

126
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:51,223
Well,
since Romanian is a romance language 

127
00:06:52,431 --> 00:06:55,520
that developed from Latin,
it's obviously quite similar to French,

128
00:06:55,521 --> 00:06:56,400
Spanish,
Italian,

129
00:06:56,401 --> 00:06:57,234
and other romance languages,
but it's also been influenced by other 

130
00:06:59,631 --> 00:07:01,750
languages,
particularly at the Slavic language,

131
00:07:01,751 --> 00:07:04,390
just because of its position in the 
Balkan [inaudible] wound.

132
00:07:04,610 --> 00:07:05,443
The balkins prop wound is an area in 
which the various languages have 

133
00:07:08,361 --> 00:07:11,270
mutually influenced each other,
including romance languages,

134
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:13,580
Slavic languages,
Greek and Albanian.

135
00:07:13,730 --> 00:07:16,160
It has also been influenced by other 
nearby languages,

136
00:07:16,161 --> 00:07:16,994
like Hungarian vocabulary.
The majority of Romanian vocabulary is 

137
00:07:20,841 --> 00:07:23,900
of Latin and romance origin based on one
study,

138
00:07:23,901 --> 00:07:28,760
63% of Romanian vocabulary is romance,
while 11.5%

139
00:07:28,761 --> 00:07:31,580
is slavic with other vocabulary coming 
from Turkish,

140
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:32,660
Greek,
Hungarian,

141
00:07:32,661 --> 00:07:36,080
and German.
But if we focus on the most common 2,500

142
00:07:36,081 --> 00:07:36,914
words in Romanian,
the percentage of romance vocabulary is 

143
00:07:38,841 --> 00:07:43,841
around 76% and slavic around 15% let's 
look at some sentences and examine their

144
00:07:44,871 --> 00:07:49,220
vocabulary.
[inaudible] is [inaudible].

145
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:52,910
This means I know the history of Europe,
very well word for word,

146
00:07:52,911 --> 00:07:56,870
it's I know history,
the Europe's very well.

147
00:07:57,140 --> 00:07:57,973
All of these words are romance words.
Cornell risk means I know or I'm 

148
00:08:01,431 --> 00:08:06,431
familiar with and it's like Conosco in 
Italian or Juco ne in French you studier

149
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:11,480
means history and it's like sturdier in 
Italian or east La.

150
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:15,310
In French it would ropey means European 
and is like a,

151
00:08:15,311 --> 00:08:20,311
it will pale in Italian or google pay on
in French four out of the day means very

152
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:21,823
in Romanian and is related to the word 
meaning strong in Italian photo tay and 

153
00:08:25,461 --> 00:08:26,294
in French fall.
So here it means very and it's not used 

154
00:08:28,551 --> 00:08:31,100
that way in Italian or French being the 
means,

155
00:08:31,101 --> 00:08:31,934
well like the Italian word Bennett and 
like the French word beyond another 

156
00:08:35,691 --> 00:08:37,310
example,
I'm spoiled,

157
00:08:37,311 --> 00:08:40,490
Machina,
foot up probe limit and Fatah casy.

158
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:44,750
This means I washed the car in front of 
the house without any problems.

159
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:46,580
Word for word,
it's myself.

160
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:47,503
I wash car,
the without problems in face houses the 

161
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,153
means me or myself like me in Italian or
in French it's the indirect object 

162
00:09:01,771 --> 00:09:02,604
pronouns which is used here because the 
verbus reflexive but means wash in the 

163
00:09:06,751 --> 00:09:07,584
first person singular.
This word developed from vulgar Latin x 

164
00:09:10,081 --> 00:09:12,870
bed Levada and it's like the Portuguese 
word pedal.

165
00:09:12,871 --> 00:09:13,704
Nevada meaning to wash machina means car
and a similar to Makena in Italian and 

166
00:09:19,051 --> 00:09:22,650
like Makina in Spanish which means 
machine or engine.

167
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:23,893
Flooded means without and comes from 
Latin thought us like 40 in Italian 

168
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:32,820
which means outside put it all blemish 
is also a romance word coming from Latin

169
00:09:32,890 --> 00:09:35,490
[inaudible] which ultimately came from 
ancient Greek.

170
00:09:35,830 --> 00:09:36,663
It means in and comes from Latin and 
ultimately goes all the way back to 

171
00:09:39,841 --> 00:09:40,674
Prodo,
Indo European Fidessa I means face or 

172
00:09:42,871 --> 00:09:44,880
front and comes from vulgar Latin.

173
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:48,480
Fuck Ya.
It's similar to fuck in Italian and fuss

174
00:09:48,510 --> 00:09:49,343
and French.
[inaudible] means house like Kazaa in 

175
00:09:52,081 --> 00:09:52,914
Italian and Casa in Spanish.
Another example today with the or prima 

176
00:09:57,521 --> 00:10:01,170
does boil.
This means we must stop the war word for

177
00:10:01,171 --> 00:10:02,004
word.
It's must subjunctive stop war that Abe 

178
00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:06,103
we means have to and as a slavic lone 
word comes from Latin C and at this 

179
00:10:11,421 --> 00:10:12,254
sentence indicates the subjunctive mood 
or putting means stop and as a Slavic 

180
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:20,520
Lone word that does bullying means war 
and is also a slavic lone word.

181
00:10:21,090 --> 00:10:23,880
Many commonly used Romanian words are of
Slavic origin.

182
00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:24,983
A few more examples are but yet then 
friend Iub to love Uplit d to Pay 

183
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:34,800
[inaudible] to wake up a go to see to 
find.

184
00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:36,263
So as you can see the majority of 
Romanian vocabulary is romance 

185
00:10:38,791 --> 00:10:41,970
vocabulary but Slavic vocabulary is also
quite evident.

186
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:42,983
We'd order.
The word order of Romanian is very 

187
00:10:44,821 --> 00:10:45,654
similar to other romance languages with 
one particular difference that we'll 

188
00:10:48,241 --> 00:10:50,380
notice.
[inaudible]

189
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:53,200
is [inaudible],
CONOSCO,

190
00:10:53,210 --> 00:10:55,020
Storia,
[inaudible] Molto Bene.

191
00:10:55,290 --> 00:10:57,720
The keywords in these sentences are all 
in the same order.

192
00:10:57,900 --> 00:10:58,733
What's different is that the Romanian 
sentence has no standalone definite 

193
00:11:01,411 --> 00:11:05,760
article or preposition for of that's 
because while other romance languages no

194
00:11:05,761 --> 00:11:09,090
longer have Cayston declensions for 
nouns and adjectives like Latin did,

195
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:10,920
Romanian does have them.
Well,

196
00:11:10,921 --> 00:11:14,680
it has three case declensions for 
announce languages that don't have case.

197
00:11:14,681 --> 00:11:18,810
Declensions often use prepositions 
instead to indicate the same information

198
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:22,320
in the sentence it [inaudible] is in the
genitive case,

199
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:23,183
meaning of Europe or Europe's.
The most basic form of the noun is 

200
00:11:25,921 --> 00:11:26,754
actually [inaudible] with an a,
but the eye at the end is a definite 

201
00:11:29,731 --> 00:11:34,410
article and the he indicates genitive 
case because the genitive case indicates

202
00:11:34,411 --> 00:11:35,244
possession.
We don't need a preposition meaning of 

203
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:41,060
like an Italian.
As for the definite article in Romanian,

204
00:11:41,070 --> 00:11:43,830
it comes at the end of the word and 
works together with the case.

205
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:48,390
Declension in the word you sturdier the 
Aa shows that the word is definite.

206
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:52,500
So we don't need a definite article 
before the word Noun cases.

207
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:53,453
Let's look a noun in Romanian and see 
how it changes form depending on its 

208
00:11:56,381 --> 00:11:58,510
case,
meaning it's role in the sentence.

209
00:11:58,540 --> 00:11:59,373
The Noun is but a but which means man 
first in the singular indefinite 

210
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:04,233
nominative and accusative wound,
but a buck genitive and dative Uber 

211
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:10,620
Bucks.
Definite but a bottle,

212
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:14,710
but a bottle and in the plural 
indefinite initiative,

213
00:12:14,711 --> 00:12:16,810
but a butts.
Who Norbert Bucks?

214
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:18,690
Definite.
But Betsy.

215
00:12:18,910 --> 00:12:19,743
But Betsy Lord,
here are a couple of examples of case 

216
00:12:22,991 --> 00:12:25,630
declensions in context focusing on the 
word,

217
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:26,493
but uh,
but,

218
00:12:27,010 --> 00:12:29,770
but a bottle,
all machinery.

219
00:12:30,070 --> 00:12:35,070
This sentence means the man bought a car
word for word Ed's man has bought a car.

220
00:12:37,210 --> 00:12:41,650
The form of the word for the man,
but about tool is in the nominative case

221
00:12:41,651 --> 00:12:42,850
because it's the subject.

222
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:46,780
So we use the definite declension for 
nominative case that we saw before.

223
00:12:47,950 --> 00:12:51,580
Another example.
Blanchet my Sheena [inaudible].

224
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:55,090
This sentence means I like the man's car
word for word,

225
00:12:55,091 --> 00:12:59,860
it's myself or to me like car,
the man,

226
00:12:59,861 --> 00:13:00,694
the possessive,
the form of the word for the man is in 

227
00:13:03,611 --> 00:13:05,830
the genitive case because it's showing 
possession.

228
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:06,873
So we use the definite declension for 
genitive data that we saw before the ul 

229
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:11,493
coming after the word,
but a but represents the definite 

230
00:13:13,871 --> 00:13:14,704
article.
If the definite article is followed by 

231
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:21,660
Ui that indicates genitive or dative,
but a but is a masculine.

232
00:13:21,761 --> 00:13:25,270
No Feminine Nouns and neuter nouns take 
different case declensions.

233
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:26,133
Yes,
Romanian has maintained neuter gender 

234
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:31,510
unlike the other romance languages.
Let's look at one more Romanian sentence

235
00:13:31,511 --> 00:13:36,511
together and see what we notice.
The ankles of amy [inaudible] up picnic.

236
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:40,600
The sentence means due to the rainy 
weather,

237
00:13:40,630 --> 00:13:42,880
we couldn't go to the picnic word for 
word.

238
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:46,180
It's from cause weather rainy.
No,

239
00:13:46,181 --> 00:13:47,014
we have could go to picnic.
The is a contraction of debt plus in 

240
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:52,533
which both come from Latin cows is a 
romance word that was borrowed from 

241
00:13:55,931 --> 00:13:56,764
French.
Cozy that amy means weather and as a 

242
00:13:59,681 --> 00:14:00,514
slavic lone word,
it's a feminine now than the base form 

243
00:14:02,531 --> 00:14:05,380
is that I may,
but in this sentence it's in the date of

244
00:14:05,381 --> 00:14:06,214
case represented by this ending I plus 
the definite article I thrill USC means 

245
00:14:11,531 --> 00:14:16,240
rainy and comes from Latin [inaudible].
This adjective is also declined to agree

246
00:14:16,241 --> 00:14:17,074
with the singular feminine date of case.
Now the day me no means no and comes 

247
00:14:21,461 --> 00:14:24,080
from Latin known,
um,

248
00:14:24,310 --> 00:14:25,143
is the first person plural form of the 
verb for to have similar to another 

249
00:14:28,451 --> 00:14:29,284
romance languages.
Past actions can be expressed by using 

250
00:14:31,451 --> 00:14:36,451
the auxiliary verb to have along with 
the past participle means could and it's

251
00:14:37,091 --> 00:14:37,924
the past participle of up with death 
which comes from Latin [inaudible] they 

252
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:43,000
saw together,
um,

253
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:47,410
and put to it,
I mean could or were able to message.

254
00:14:47,410 --> 00:14:52,410
It means go and comes from the Latin 
medidata meaning to dip or to plunge.

255
00:14:52,970 --> 00:14:54,530
But in Romania,
Romanian it means to go.

256
00:14:55,010 --> 00:14:55,843
La is a preposition,
meaning to and comes from the Latin you 

257
00:14:58,431 --> 00:15:02,930
luck and picnic means picnic and comes 
from the French word picnic.

258
00:15:03,830 --> 00:15:07,250
If you speak a romance language or if 
you've ever studied a romance language,

259
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:10,130
then you'll probably notice a lot of 
similarities with Romania,

260
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:13,190
but you may have to look a little closer
to notice those similarities.

261
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:14,083
Romanian clearly developed in a somewhat
different direction from other romance 

262
00:15:16,881 --> 00:15:19,430
languages and even though it was re 
latinized,

263
00:15:19,431 --> 00:15:23,660
it still feels more slavic in some ways 
and the way words are articulated in the

264
00:15:23,661 --> 00:15:26,270
way words are formed and in some details
of the grammar.

265
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:27,253
That's what makes Romanian interesting 
and unique amongst the romance 

266
00:15:29,301 --> 00:15:31,970
languages.
It's development in geographic isolation

267
00:15:31,971 --> 00:15:34,670
from the others and it's contact with 
neighboring languages.

268
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:37,670
So the question of the day for speakers 
of Romanian,

269
00:15:37,671 --> 00:15:41,750
how similar to you think Romanian is to 
the other romance languages like Italian

270
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:44,000
and for speakers of other romance 
languages.

271
00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:44,863
How similar or different to you think 
Romanian is from your language and what 

272
00:15:47,541 --> 00:15:49,760
stands out to you as the biggest 
difference?

273
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:52,580
Let us know in the comments down below.
Be sure to follow Lang,

274

twitter and instagram.

275
00:15:55,130 --> 00:15:55,963
And again,
I would like to say thank you to all of 

276
00:15:57,201 --> 00:15:58,034
my patrion supporters,
especially these ones right here on the 

277
00:16:00,081 --> 00:16:03,850
