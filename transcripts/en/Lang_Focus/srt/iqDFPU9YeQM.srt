Hello everyone.
Welcome to the Lange Focus Channel and 

3
00:00:07,291 --> 00:00:11,340
my name is polled it.
Why did English become the international

4
00:00:11,341 --> 00:00:13,590
language?
That is the question that we're going to

5
00:00:13,591 --> 00:00:14,424
answer today.
English is the defacto Global Lingua 

6
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,320
Franca.
It's the language of global commerce.

7
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:21,960
It's the main language of international 
diplomacy.

8
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:25,830
It's the language of air traffic control
and it's the language of the majority of

9
00:00:25,831 --> 00:00:28,620
academic journals and maybe most 
importantly for us,

10
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:32,190
it's the most common language on the 
Internet and it's also the language that

11
00:00:32,191 --> 00:00:33,024
international travelers with different 
native languages used to communicate 

12
00:00:35,731 --> 00:00:38,550
with each other.
The very definition of a Lingua Franca,

13
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,040
but how did English reach this kind of 
status?

14
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:41,903
Well,
it's partly because of the role of the 

15
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:45,780
United States of America as a global 
superpower,

16
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:49,200
but the stage was set earlier than that.
In the 16th century,

17
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:50,093
England started to establish overseas 
colonies and by the end of the 18th 

18
00:00:53,131 --> 00:00:53,964
century,
the British Empire had grown quite 

19
00:00:55,351 --> 00:00:59,550
extensive with colonies and a few parts 
of India and Africa in the Caribbean,

20
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:00,563
Canada,
and what was to become the United 

21
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:02,460
States.

22
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:05,670
The British were not the only ones 
establishing colonies of course,

23
00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:09,360
much of present day Canada and the US 
was part of new France,

24
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:12,030
a large area that had been colonized by 
the French,

25
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:13,163
but these areas were lost to the British
during the seven years war and much of 

26
00:01:16,321 --> 00:01:17,154
what is now the southern and western 
United States was colonized by the 

27
00:01:19,681 --> 00:01:22,710
Spanish,
but these areas were taken by the United

28
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:24,840
States in wars with Spain and later 
Mexico.

29
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:29,210
The Dutch had also colonized an area 
known as New Netherlands,

30
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:32,160
but it was lost to the British and the 
late 17th century.

31
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:33,713
There were also non British immigrants 
to the British colonies of North 

32
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:37,230
America.
For example,

33
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:40,800
German speaking immigrants for a long 
part of the USA is history.

34
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:43,620
German was at second most widely spoken 
language.

35
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:47,580
It declined in use during the first 
world war because of the stigma of being

36
00:01:47,581 --> 00:01:48,414
associated with Germany.
So while there were numerous languages 

37
00:01:51,361 --> 00:01:52,194
spoken by settlers,
English became the dominant language of 

38
00:01:54,391 --> 00:01:55,224
the United States.
The British kept on establishing 

39
00:01:56,971 --> 00:01:57,804
colonies after American independence,
including much larger areas of the 

40
00:02:01,021 --> 00:02:04,440
Indian subcontinent and Africa,
Australia and New Zealand,

41
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:08,970
and after the first world war in the 
Middle East in 1922,

42
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,050
the British empire covered almost a 
quarter of the earth and about one fifth

43
00:02:13,051 --> 00:02:16,290
of the world's population.
Some of these countries became populated

44
00:02:16,291 --> 00:02:17,124
by English settlers,
and these are the countries where 

45
00:02:18,661 --> 00:02:21,720
English became the dominant language,
replacing many others.
