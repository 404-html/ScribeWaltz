1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:03,190
Hm.
What's the topic of today's video?

2
00:00:03,790 --> 00:00:05,050
No,
that's far too general.

3
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:07,210
No,
it's not that either.

4
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:10,420
No,
I already made a video on that one.

5
00:00:11,950 --> 00:00:12,910
Yes,
that's it.

6
00:00:14,590 --> 00:00:15,423
Hello everyone.
Welcome to the Lange Focus Channel and 

7
00:00:17,071 --> 00:00:17,904
my name is Paul.
Today I'm going to talk about the 

8
00:00:19,661 --> 00:00:22,480
Russian language.
Why is Russian important?

9
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:23,493
Well,
Russia is one of the world's major 

10
00:00:25,091 --> 00:00:25,924
languages.
It is one of the six official languages 

11
00:00:27,731 --> 00:00:28,564
of the United Nations and it is the 
eighth most widely spoken language in 

12
00:00:31,301 --> 00:00:32,134
the world with around $155 million 
native speakers and around 260 million 

13
00:00:36,371 --> 00:00:39,070
speakers in total.
If we include second language speakers.

14
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:41,350
It's an official language in Russia of 
course,

15
00:00:41,351 --> 00:00:43,570
but also in Belo Reus,
Tajikistan,

16
00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:44,493
Kurgestan and Kazakhstan.
It is also an official language and 38 

17
00:00:47,741 --> 00:00:48,574
other unrecognized states,
autonomous territories and regions in 

18
00:00:51,491 --> 00:00:53,260
Ukraine,
Moldova and Georgia,

19
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:57,640
and also a few localities in Romania and
the Russian economic zone in Spitsbergen

20
00:00:57,641 --> 00:00:58,474
in Norway.
It is also widely spoken as a second 

21
00:01:00,671 --> 00:01:03,580
language on a Lingua Franca,
throughout much of Central Asia,

22
00:01:03,610 --> 00:01:05,620
the Caucasus region,
and in eastern Europe.

23
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:08,650
Even in a lot of places where it is not 
an official language,

24
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:09,633
that's why Russian is important.
Russian is the most widely spoken 

25
00:01:12,161 --> 00:01:12,994
language of the Slavic language family.
Have a look at my video on the Slavic 

26
00:01:15,731 --> 00:01:18,610
language family here to learn more about
it in detail,

27
00:01:18,730 --> 00:01:19,563
but in brief the Slavic languages or a 
branch of the Indo European language 

28
00:01:22,751 --> 00:01:24,820
family and the beginning of the Slavic 
language.

29
00:01:24,821 --> 00:01:27,610
Branch traces back to a language called 
Slavek,

30
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:31,300
which existed around 500 ce.
Over the next few hundred years,

31
00:01:31,301 --> 00:01:34,720
Prodo slavek split into three varieties,
west Slavic,

32
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:35,583
south Slavic and east Slavek,
which eventually diverged into branches 

33
00:01:38,831 --> 00:01:41,560
of the Slavic language family containing
numerous languages.

34
00:01:41,561 --> 00:01:45,610
Each Russian is an East Slavic language,
along with Belorussian Ukrainian,

35
00:01:45,611 --> 00:01:49,060
and also routine at the time that these 
three branches developed,

36
00:01:49,061 --> 00:01:52,630
there was a single slavic literary 
language that all Slavs could understand

37
00:01:52,690 --> 00:01:53,523
that language was old church slavonic.
Russian has written in the cyrillic 

38
00:01:57,701 --> 00:01:58,534
script,
which was created for the purpose of 

39
00:01:59,741 --> 00:02:02,620
writing old church slavonic until the 
14th century.

40
00:02:02,621 --> 00:02:05,050
The ancestors of modern day Russians,
Ukrainians,

41
00:02:05,051 --> 00:02:07,590
and Belarusians living in a state called
Kevin.

42
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:08,433
Russ spoke dialects of old East Slavic.
The spoken language existed alongside 

43
00:02:12,881 --> 00:02:15,040
the literary language of Old Church 
Slavonic,

44
00:02:15,130 --> 00:02:16,750
a situation of glossier.

45
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:19,060
There is,
however,

46
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:19,893
some evidence that people used to write 
in the spoken vernacular for some kinds 

47
00:02:22,571 --> 00:02:23,404
of casual writing.
Birchbark letters from the town of 

48
00:02:25,091 --> 00:02:25,924
Nevada road in the 14th century are 
written in the vernacular language and 

49
00:02:28,751 --> 00:02:31,480
the concern topics of daily life.
Old Church slavonic,

50
00:02:31,481 --> 00:02:32,314
however,
it was the literary and religious 

51
00:02:33,371 --> 00:02:38,320
language in the 13th century CE Kevin 
risk was conquered by the Mongol Empire,

52
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:42,430
which brought a lot of foreign Turkic 
loan words into the East Slavic dialect,

53
00:02:42,490 --> 00:02:45,370
especially words related to political 
and financial matters.

54
00:02:45,490 --> 00:02:48,100
After the end of Mongol rule,
in the 14th century,

55
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:51,370
the oldest Slavic area was split into 
two separate states,

56
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:52,383
the Grand Duchy of Moscow to the east 
and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania to the 

57
00:02:55,241 --> 00:02:57,870
West in the general area of Ukraine,
Belarus,

58
00:02:57,910 --> 00:02:58,743
and Lithuania.
The oldest Slavic dialects in those two 

59
00:03:00,851 --> 00:03:03,730
states began to split and develop in 
different directions.

60
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:04,713
In the West,
the Ruthenian language emerged with 

61
00:03:05,921 --> 00:03:06,754
heavy Polish influence,
Ruthenian dialects would later develop 

62
00:03:09,071 --> 00:03:11,910
into Ukrainian and in in the east 
Russia,

63
00:03:11,911 --> 00:03:14,920
and emerged with much more influence 
from old church slavonic.

64
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:19,300
Modern Russian today resulted from a 
kind of tug of war between an old church

65
00:03:19,301 --> 00:03:20,134
slavonic on the one hand and the 
vernacular spoken dialects on the other 

66
00:03:23,021 --> 00:03:24,070
hand.
For example,

67
00:03:24,071 --> 00:03:27,850
in 1453 ce,
after the fall of the Byzantine Empire,

68
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:28,833
Byzantine and Bulgarian scholars began 
moving to Moscow and they were upset 

69
00:03:32,171 --> 00:03:35,260
that old church slavonic had become 
corrupted or crucified,

70
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:39,190
and they tried to standardize the 
language to remove these impurities.

71
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:42,010
So a unique Russian language had begun 
to emerge,

72
00:03:42,011 --> 00:03:45,370
but scholars pulled the language back 
towards old church slavonic.

73
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:50,110
But then during the rule of Peter the 
great from 1696 to 1725,

74
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:53,410
the written language was pulled in a 
different direction away from old church

75
00:03:53,411 --> 00:03:55,630
slavonic.
In order to increase literacy,

76
00:03:55,631 --> 00:03:58,150
he simplified the orthography of the 
written language,

77
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:00,520
eliminating some letters and some 
diacritics.

78
00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:01,563
He also made great efforts to modernize 
and westernize Russia and started to 

79
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:05,253
Orient Russia towards Europe and French 
became the common language of the upper 

80
00:04:08,681 --> 00:04:09,640
classes in Russia.

81
00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:10,803
As you might guess,
this resulted in the adoption of some 

82
00:04:12,461 --> 00:04:16,180
French loan words into Russian.
He also oversaw the intentional adoption

83
00:04:16,181 --> 00:04:20,290
of specialized modern vocabulary from 
various European languages like French,

84
00:04:20,291 --> 00:04:21,190
Dutch,
and German.

85
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:22,173
Peter,
the great's reforms were some of the 

86
00:04:23,141 --> 00:04:25,990
first steps in the development of modern
literary Russian,

87
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:26,973
the basis of standard Russian today,
another influential person in the 

88
00:04:29,621 --> 00:04:34,621
development of modern literary Russian 
was Mikaila Luminoso in 1755.

89
00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:35,523
He wrote a grammar of the Russian 
language which revolutionized the 

90
00:04:37,721 --> 00:04:38,554
written language by combining old church
slavonic with the spoken language 

91
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,273
throughout the grammar.
He refers to old church slavonic as the 

92
00:04:44,171 --> 00:04:45,004
language of high style and he refers to 
the spoken language as the language of 

93
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:52,090
low style and he advocated a blended 
middle style for most forms of writing.

94
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:53,103
The high style was basically reserved 
for religious texts and the low style 

95
00:04:55,631 --> 00:04:59,440
was reserved for the most casual written
material in the following decades.

96
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:03,430
Authors and poets developed a new middle
style that would form the core of modern

97
00:05:03,431 --> 00:05:04,264
standard Russian.
The most influential was the poet 

98
00:05:06,221 --> 00:05:07,054
Alexander Pushkin,
who was sometimes referred to as the 

99
00:05:08,891 --> 00:05:09,724
father of the modern Russian language.
He fully developed the idea of three 

100
00:05:13,091 --> 00:05:14,890
different language registers,
high,

101
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:17,440
middle and low,
making the spoken vernacular,

102
00:05:17,441 --> 00:05:18,274
a legitimate part of the language.
He also greatly expanded the vocabulary 

103
00:05:21,311 --> 00:05:22,144
of literary Russian by directly 
translating phrases and idioms from 

104
00:05:24,911 --> 00:05:27,790
other languages.
He greatly influenced modern literary,

105
00:05:27,791 --> 00:05:28,624
Russian,
and as a result of modern standard 

106
00:05:29,831 --> 00:05:30,664
Russian,
which formed during this time based on 

107
00:05:31,901 --> 00:05:32,890
the literary language

108
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:35,453
in the 20th century,
Russian underwent some small changes 

109
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:38,333
mainly in orthography,
but by far the most important thing to 

110
00:05:40,561 --> 00:05:43,860
happen to the language was the creation 
of the Soviet empire,

111
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:46,320
universal schooling and the mass media 
spread,

112
00:05:46,321 --> 00:05:49,650
modern standard Russian and reduced 
dialectal variation in Russian.

113
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:50,693
It also spread the language over a vast 
geographic area covering all the member 

114
00:05:53,821 --> 00:05:55,770
states of the USSR.
Today,

115
00:05:55,771 --> 00:05:56,604
Russian is still widely spoken in all of
those areas and is a common lingua 

116
00:05:59,301 --> 00:06:00,134
Franca between different ethnic groups 
and between the citizens of different 

117
00:06:02,571 --> 00:06:03,404
countries.
So what does Russian like orthography 

118
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,433
Russian is written in cyrillic script,
an alphabet consisting of 33 letters 

119
00:06:09,891 --> 00:06:11,900
which were mostly developed from Greek 
letters,

120
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:14,060
some of the same as letters of the Latin
alphabet,

121
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:17,000
but some of the sounds they represent 
are different like this one

122
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:19,063
phonology.

123
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:20,333
There are 21 consonants in Russian,
but 15 of them can be pronounced in two 

124
00:06:23,251 --> 00:06:25,020
different ways,
either hard or soft,

125
00:06:25,170 --> 00:06:28,320
and you have to judge which sound to 
make by looking at the letter that comes

126
00:06:28,321 --> 00:06:31,050
after the continent.
The soft sound is palletized,

127
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:33,810
meaning that part of your tongue reaches
the roof of your mouth.

128
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:37,020
This makes the consonant kind of sound 
like it's followed by a y sound.

129
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:38,100
Here are some examples.

130
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:39,680
Buck,
buck,

131
00:06:39,850 --> 00:06:42,160
buck,
buck model,

132
00:06:42,790 --> 00:06:47,790
mel pro suck,
suck vowels.

133
00:06:48,730 --> 00:06:49,563
There are six basic vowels in Russian,
but there's a lot of variation in the 

134
00:06:52,421 --> 00:06:53,254
vowels depending on the surrounding 
sounds and based on the stress pattern 

135
00:06:55,811 --> 00:06:56,644
of the work that wills are often reduced
when they appear in an unstressed 

136
00:06:59,291 --> 00:07:00,124
syllable.
This can make it a challenge to 

137
00:07:01,091 --> 00:07:03,220
pronounce words correctly based on their
spelling.

138
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:06,070
Grammar.
Russian is a fusional language,

139
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:06,933
meaning that suffixes and prefixes are 
added to root words to communicate 

140
00:07:10,091 --> 00:07:12,490
grammatical meaning.
Let's look at nouns first.

141
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:13,413
There are six now in cases in Russian,
meaning that both the singular and the 

142
00:07:16,091 --> 00:07:16,924
plural form of unowned can't take six 
different forms depending on their 

143
00:07:19,601 --> 00:07:20,434
grammatical function in the sentence.
Let's look at an example using the word 

144
00:07:23,261 --> 00:07:25,030
for sister nominative case.

145
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,073
Sister,
the sister reads genitive case since 

146
00:07:30,551 --> 00:07:32,460
three years now,
misses three.

147
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:36,290
I know the sister's name,
date of case series three.

148
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:40,150
Sister,
the brother gave the sister a ticket.

149
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:45,550
Accusative case says through visits,
through the brother sees the sister.

150
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:50,710
Instrumental case says Roy Roy,
I live with the sister.

151
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:55,510
Prepositional case says three masses on 
the sister.

152
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:57,173
On a side note,
it's interesting to notice the cognate 

153
00:07:58,771 --> 00:08:02,490
vocabulary between Russian and English 
and some other European languages.

154
00:08:02,610 --> 00:08:07,140
Just the his sister,
his brother mediate his ticket,

155
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:11,550
and even the word foresee reminds me of 
the Italian word Vedanta,

156
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:14,760
which means to see.
So here we see some clear indications of

157
00:08:14,761 --> 00:08:17,190
Russian being an Indo European language.
Now,

158
00:08:17,191 --> 00:08:20,160
back to the noun cases.
The case endings are different depending

159
00:08:20,161 --> 00:08:20,994
on the gender of the now.
Russia nouns are grouped according to 

160
00:08:23,161 --> 00:08:24,330
gender,
with masculine,

161
00:08:24,331 --> 00:08:25,164
feminine and Neuter Nouns.
You can normally tell the nouns gender 

162
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:28,224
based on its ending.
Feminine Nouns can take either of these 

163
00:08:30,181 --> 00:08:31,530
endings,
neuter.

164
00:08:31,531 --> 00:08:34,590
Nouns can take either of these endings 
and masculine nouns.

165
00:08:34,730 --> 00:08:35,563
The nouns ending in any other letter.
The one tricky exception is that some 

166
00:08:38,371 --> 00:08:39,204
nouns and in this letter,
and these can be either masculine or 

167
00:08:41,761 --> 00:08:42,594
feminine,
so you need to memorize the gender of 

168
00:08:43,891 --> 00:08:44,580
those ones.

169
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:45,413
Adjectives,
adjectives and Russian are quite 

170
00:08:47,341 --> 00:08:48,174
complicated.
They are inflicted to agree with the 

171
00:08:49,741 --> 00:08:50,574
Noun they modified in gender number and 
in case that means that any particular 

172
00:08:54,211 --> 00:08:57,450
adjective can 24 different forums like 
this.

173
00:08:57,660 --> 00:09:00,780
Wow.
Let's look at a couple of examples.

174
00:09:01,050 --> 00:09:04,380
This is the adjective meaning new in the
nominative case.

175
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:09,900
No Hilton over here.
This is a new car in the genitive case,

176
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:12,900
Nova,
Nova.

177
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:13,853
After my Buddha,
the new car's color so we can see how 

178
00:09:16,381 --> 00:09:19,610
the ending of the adjective changes to 
make it agree with the noun,

179
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:20,753
but it's worth noting that the 
inflectional endings added to the 

180
00:09:22,741 --> 00:09:25,320
adjective or different from those added 
to the now,

181
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:29,040
so you need to memorize a big set of 
endings for nouns and when to use them,

182
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:29,903
but you have to memorize a whole 
different set of endings for adjectives 

183
00:09:32,251 --> 00:09:33,084
and when to use those verbs.
The Russian language has three verb 

184
00:09:36,121 --> 00:09:37,020
tenses,
past,

185
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,220
present,
and future.

186
00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:41,400
That sounds straightforward,
but Russian verbs are also distinguished

187
00:09:41,401 --> 00:09:44,850
based on something called aspect.
There's the perfective aspect,

188
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:47,550
which means that an action has been 
completed once.

189
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:48,503
Then there's the imperfection of aspect 
which shows that the action is still in 

190
00:09:51,151 --> 00:09:52,500
progress,
still ongoing,

191
00:09:52,650 --> 00:09:54,780
or that it's an action that will be 
recurring,

192
00:09:54,781 --> 00:09:57,180
will be repeated many times in Russian 
verbs.

193
00:09:57,181 --> 00:09:58,014
There are two different verb stems for 
the imperfections and the perfect 

194
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,610
aspect,
basically like two different words.

195
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:05,860
Let's look at an example for the verb 
meaning to write first.

196
00:10:05,861 --> 00:10:09,850
The perfective visa and the imperfection
of Pisa.

197
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:13,050
Either of these stems can be conjugated 
for past,

198
00:10:13,051 --> 00:10:14,400
present,
and future tenses.

199
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:18,120
Let's look at an example of how aspect 
changes the meaning of a sentence.

200
00:10:18,210 --> 00:10:19,043
This sentence uses the verb with 
perfective verb stem and is in the 

201
00:10:21,601 --> 00:10:23,220
future tense.
Yanna.

202
00:10:23,530 --> 00:10:26,340
Can you go this sentence means I will 
write a book,

203
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:27,233
but when we take the aspect into account
that the meaning is I will write one 

204
00:10:29,971 --> 00:10:32,430
specific book and action that will be 
completed.

205
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:33,533
This next sentence uses the imperfection
verb stem and is also in the future 

206
00:10:36,211 --> 00:10:37,044
tense.
Besides the meaning of this one is more 

207
00:10:39,571 --> 00:10:42,090
like I will be writing a book.
In other words,

208
00:10:42,091 --> 00:10:42,924
I will be in the process of writing a 
book at a certain time in the future or 

209
00:10:46,021 --> 00:10:48,570
if we use the plural form of book,
then the meaning changes.

210
00:10:48,571 --> 00:10:51,270
It means I will write two books Jambo 
besides,

211
00:10:52,690 --> 00:10:55,680
and that means I will write numerous 
books of recurring action.

212
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:56,693
So in that case,
the imperfection of aspect indicates a 

213
00:10:58,441 --> 00:10:59,274
slightly different meaning.
Basic word order the most common word 

214
00:11:02,221 --> 00:11:05,160
order in Russian as Svo,
but because of the case system,

215
00:11:05,161 --> 00:11:08,490
the word order is much more flexible 
than it is in English and English.

216
00:11:08,491 --> 00:11:09,324
We normally judge the function of a word
depending on where it is in the 

217
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:14,250
sentence,
but in Russian we have the case system.

218
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:17,490
The case endings can tell us the 
function of the word so you can move the

219
00:11:17,491 --> 00:11:20,040
words around and we still understand 
what the subject is,

220
00:11:20,041 --> 00:11:20,874
what the object is and so on.
So a basic sentence might be of course 

221
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:27,090
gripped by Malama,
meaning the cat caught the most,

222
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:31,850
but you could also have much by molecule
or by Mahler,

223
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:34,590
Gorshkov and some other possible word 
orders,

224
00:11:34,770 --> 00:11:37,170
so the basic word order is flexible like
that.

225
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,033
However,
in some cases the context or the style 

226
00:11:39,841 --> 00:11:40,674
that you are trying to communicate it 
and will determine the word order 

227
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:45,270
articles,
like most Slavic languages,

228
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:46,163
Russian doesn't have any articles.
It doesn't have words like [inaudible] 

229
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:50,970
or the.
If you have any Russian speaking friends

230
00:11:50,971 --> 00:11:53,010
who dropped the articles when they're 
speaking English,

231
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:55,840
that's probably the reason.
So how hard is rushing to learn?

232
00:11:55,990 --> 00:11:56,823
Well,
according to the American Foreign 

233
00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:00,520
Service Institute,
Russian is a category four language,

234
00:12:00,610 --> 00:12:02,890
the most difficult categories,
category five,

235
00:12:02,891 --> 00:12:04,720
and that includes Japanese,
mandarin,

236
00:12:04,721 --> 00:12:07,510
and Arabic,
but Russian is in category four.

237
00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:10,330
That means that it's relatively 
difficult for English speakers,

238
00:12:10,331 --> 00:12:11,164
but not the most difficult.
The most challenging things will likely 

239
00:12:13,421 --> 00:12:14,254
be the inflection of nouns and 
adjectives as well as the system of 

240
00:12:16,721 --> 00:12:17,554
verbal aspect.
Some people mistakenly assume that the 

241
00:12:19,901 --> 00:12:20,734
cyrillic alphabet is going to be the 
most challenging part of learning 

242
00:12:22,841 --> 00:12:23,674
Russian,
but people actually learn that fairly 

243
00:12:25,151 --> 00:12:28,060
quickly once they start rushing as a 
major global language.

244
00:12:28,061 --> 00:12:28,894
That will be very useful to you if you 
spend any time in Russia or in any of 

245
00:12:31,511 --> 00:12:34,720
the former Soviet republics.
So your efforts will be well rewarded.

246
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:38,050
So the question of the day,
for people who have studied Russian,

247
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:38,913
what did you find challenging about 
Russia and what did you find 

248
00:12:40,751 --> 00:12:43,590
straightforward about Russian and for 
native speakers of Russia?

249
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:44,493
Russia is a huge country.
Do you notice a lot of variation in the 

250
00:12:46,751 --> 00:12:49,270
way that Russia has spoken in different 
parts of the countries?

251
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,880
Are there noticeable accents or dialects
these days?
