1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:03,750
Wake the fuck up the Americans.
I'm here to talk some sense into you.

2
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:04,890
Well,
hold on a second.

3
00:00:05,010 --> 00:00:05,843
I'm Canadian and when I say Americans,
I'm including Canadians in that because 

4
00:00:09,151 --> 00:00:11,940
Canadians admitted we're really just the
51st state.

5
00:00:12,070 --> 00:00:15,150
We're like California with Igloos.
So Canadians,

6
00:00:15,151 --> 00:00:17,010
Americans,
same thing anywhere.

7
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:19,800
What was I saying?
We've got the Americans.

8
00:00:19,801 --> 00:00:22,650
I'm here to talk some sense into you as 
a nation.

9
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:23,543
We suck with languages.
43% of all people around the world are 

10
00:00:27,841 --> 00:00:28,674
bilingual.
That includes over 50% of the people in 

11
00:00:31,291 --> 00:00:34,380
Europe and in some countries like 
Indonesia and Philippines,

12
00:00:34,381 --> 00:00:35,214
virtually everybody is bilingual and 
it's very common in a lot of countries 

13
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:40,170
for people to speak three,
four,

14
00:00:40,171 --> 00:00:43,020
or even five languages on a regular 
basis.

15
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:47,430
But in America,
only 20% of the people are bilingual.

16
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:48,563
And guess what?
Almost all of those people are 

17
00:00:50,541 --> 00:00:54,590
immigrants or the children of immigrants
amongst homegrown Americans,

18
00:00:54,591 --> 00:00:55,424
very few are bilingual.
And in the northern province of Canada 

19
00:00:58,371 --> 00:01:02,450
at the situation is not much different.
Most of the people who are bilingual are

20
00:01:02,451 --> 00:01:05,660
immigrants or Francophone Canadians,
French speaking,

21
00:01:05,661 --> 00:01:07,430
Canadians,
anglophone.

22
00:01:07,431 --> 00:01:09,890
Canadians are generally modeling.
You will,

23
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:12,650
very few of them are bilingual.
In Australia,

24
00:01:12,651 --> 00:01:15,200
the numbers are even worse.
And in Europe,

25
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:18,560
guests which countries have the lowest 
levels of bilingualism?

26
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:21,913
So at the point I'm making is that 
angler phones basically do not become 

27
00:01:25,230 --> 00:01:28,320
bilingual.
I don't want to say that anglophones are

28
00:01:28,321 --> 00:01:31,650
lazy,
but why the hell are we so damn lazy?

29
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:32,753
Well,
obviously it's because of a lack of 

30
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:37,410
incentive.
English is the international language.

31
00:01:37,411 --> 00:01:38,244
So why should I put in all this time and
effort to speak another language when 

32
00:01:41,131 --> 00:01:43,050
other people will just speak English 
with me?

33
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:44,423
Isn't it Kinda sorta arrogant to expect 
all the other people to put in all the 

34
00:01:48,091 --> 00:01:48,924
effort to accommodate us?
Anybody who has traveled has probably 

35
00:01:51,811 --> 00:01:52,644
seen Americans or other anglophones 
getting frustrated with the locals when 

36
00:01:55,621 --> 00:01:56,454
they couldn't speak English.
But if those anglophones had ever 

37
00:01:59,191 --> 00:02:01,170
learned a second language for 
themselves,

38
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:05,310
maybe they would be able to understand 
and empathize with that other person and

39
00:02:05,311 --> 00:02:06,144
find a way to communicate with them.
The truth is English is not spoken by 

40
00:02:09,691 --> 00:02:10,524
most people in the world despite the 
fact that it's the de facto 

41
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:14,400
international language.

42
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:15,593
Most people simply don't speak English 
unless you stick to the men tourist 

43
00:02:18,421 --> 00:02:21,090
traps and who likes cheesy tourist 
traps.

44
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,193
Knowing another major language can 
greatly help you communicate around the 

45
00:02:24,991 --> 00:02:25,824
world.
If there's also no guarantee that 

46
00:02:26,971 --> 00:02:29,940
English will be the international 
language for much longer.

47
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:33,300
Not too long ago,
the international language was French,

48
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:36,420
and in the future,
maybe it will be Chinese or Spanish.

49
00:02:36,421 --> 00:02:37,920
Who knows?
Well,

50
00:02:37,921 --> 00:02:40,590
it probably won't be Chinese,
but you never know.

51
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:43,300
The number of Spanish speakers is 
growing rapidly,

52
00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:44,403
and a lot of Spanish speaking countries 
are in the process of developing 

53
00:02:47,261 --> 00:02:48,094
rapidly.
So Spanish could become much more 

54
00:02:49,781 --> 00:02:51,670
important than the near future.
But even if.
