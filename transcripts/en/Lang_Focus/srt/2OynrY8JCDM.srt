00:00:00,860 --> 00:00:01,693
Hello everyone,
welcome to the Lange Focus Channel and 

2
00:00:03,361 --> 00:00:06,420
my name is Paul.
Today I'm going to answer the question,

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:07,313
is English really a Germanic language?
If you've seen any of my videos on 

4
00:00:10,711 --> 00:00:13,020
Germanic languages,
like my Afrikaans video,

5
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:13,883
like my Dutch video,
like my German video or like my north 

6
00:00:16,091 --> 00:00:16,924
dramatic languages video,
then you probably saw that English is 

7
00:00:19,381 --> 00:00:22,380
also a Germanic language,
but a lot of people write comments,

8
00:00:22,381 --> 00:00:24,750
expressing some confusion over this.
They write things like,

9
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:26,790
Paul,
are you sure it's a Germanic language?

10
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:28,620
Are you sure it's not a romance 
language?

11
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:29,610
Well,
that's a good question.

12
00:00:29,611 --> 00:00:32,760
If a native English speaker who had 
never learned another language before,

13
00:00:32,761 --> 00:00:36,480
had to look at a page of French and then
had a look at a page of German or Dutch,

14
00:00:36,481 --> 00:00:39,900
they would probably be able to 
understand more of the page of French or

15
00:00:39,901 --> 00:00:42,420
if they had to look at a page of Spanish
or a page of Italian,

16
00:00:42,421 --> 00:00:45,420
they would probably be able to pick out 
a lot of words that they recognize,

17
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:46,313
but on the other hand,
if they looked at a page of Dutch or 

18
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:48,714
German,
they probably wouldn't be able to pick 

19
00:00:49,711 --> 00:00:52,500
out as many without deciphering the 
words a little bit first.

20
00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:53,483
So in that case,
why is English a Germanic language and 

21
00:00:54,991 --> 00:00:57,810
not a romance language in the field of 
linguistics?

22
00:00:57,811 --> 00:01:01,140
Languages are categorized according to 
their genetic relationship.

23
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:02,003
Genetic relationship means that they 
have a common ancestor and therefore 

24
00:01:04,801 --> 00:01:05,634
they have some common features that 
distinguish them from other groups of 

25
00:01:07,741 --> 00:01:08,574
languages.
This type of genetic relationship 

26
00:01:10,171 --> 00:01:11,004
between languages can commonly be seen 
in the grammar and syntax of the 

27
00:01:13,561 --> 00:01:14,394
language,
but the current vocabulary of the 

28
00:01:15,781 --> 00:01:19,050
language is not really taken into 
account in its categorization.

29
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:20,093
Even when a language has a huge number 
of loan words and it's vocabulary 

30
00:01:22,741 --> 00:01:23,574
changes a lot.
That does not change the categorization 

31
00:01:25,411 --> 00:01:26,244
of that language.
So because English developed from Provo 

32
00:01:28,830 --> 00:01:30,150
Germanic,
it is a Germanic language,

33
00:01:30,151 --> 00:01:33,240
despite massive changes that have taken 
place in its vocabulary.

34
00:01:33,330 --> 00:01:36,720
The vocabulary of English has been 
highly influenced by romance languages.

35
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:39,930
Romance meaning Latin in any language 
that has developed from Latin,

36
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:40,980
like French,
Spanish,

37
00:01:40,981 --> 00:01:41,910
Italian cetera.

38
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:44,790
So how much has it been influenced?
Well,

39
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:50,120
English vocabulary is 26 percent 
Germanic and it's 29 percent French.

40
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:51,413
Wait,
you're telling me that there's more 

41
00:01:52,291 --> 00:01:53,124
French vocabulary than Germanic 
vocabulary even though it's a Germanic 

42
00:01:55,591 --> 00:01:56,550
language,
that's all.

43
00:01:56,810 --> 00:01:57,241
Oh,
but wait,

44
00:01:57,241 --> 00:02:00,120
there's also 29 percent Latin 
vocabulary.

45
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:01,013
So that means together 58 percent of 
English vocabulary comes from romance 

46
00:02:04,111 --> 00:02:05,010
languages.
Wow.

47
00:02:05,011 --> 00:02:08,190
That's more than I thought.
Another six percent comes from Greek.

48
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:09,153
Another four percent comes from other 
languages in four percent comes from 

49
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:12,593
proper names.
I can't really think of any vocabulary 

50
00:02:14,731 --> 00:02:17,880
that comes from proper names aside from 
randy.

51
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,073
So if we ignore the origins of English 
and that's grammar and syntax and just 

52
00:02:21,811 --> 00:02:22,644
focus on the vocabulary for a minute,
then English is largely a romance 

53
00:02:25,501 --> 00:02:28,110
language.
How did so much romance vocabulary enter

54
00:02:28,111 --> 00:02:28,944
English?
Much of the French vocabulary entered 

55
00:02:30,421 --> 00:02:33,180
English after the Norman conquest of 10 
66.

56
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:36,053
The Norman spoke of regional French 
dialect called old Norman or Norman 

57
00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:40,403
French.
The upper classes in England spoke 

58
00:02:41,221 --> 00:02:42,054
French for around 300 years.
English was influenced by the Norman 

59
00:02:44,761 --> 00:02:45,594
French dialect,
but also by Parisian French due to its 

60
00:02:47,581 --> 00:02:50,280
prestige and cultural influence in the 
following centuries,

61
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:54,450
huge amounts of French vocabulary 
entered English and had lost much of its

62
00:02:54,451 --> 00:02:55,284
old English vocabulary,
but in many cases there are pairs of 

63
00:02:57,151 --> 00:02:59,410
equivalent Germanic and French 
vocabulary,

64
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:00,393
but within those pairs there's often a 
slightly different meaning or usage for 

65
00:03:02,741 --> 00:03:04,420
the Germanic word and for the French 
word,

66
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:05,283
an interesting example or the pairs of 
words representing animals versus foods 

67
00:03:08,561 --> 00:03:09,394
that come from those animals.
The animals are represented by dramatic 

68
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:14,110
words and the foods are represented by 
French loan words.

69
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:16,270
For example,
cow comes from old English coop,

70
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:19,780
but beef comes from French.
Pig comes from old English,

71
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:22,450
picked up,
but pork comes from French Paul,

72
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:24,940
but I don't know what the pronunciation 
would have been like in Norman.

73
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:27,480
French chief comes from old English 
shop,

74
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:29,720
but mutton comes from old French and we 
don't.

75
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:34,120
Snail comes from old English Snyder and 
escargo comes from Norman French.

76
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,033
[inaudible] French also influenced 
English because of its huge cultural 

77
00:03:37,931 --> 00:03:38,764
influence on Europe from the renaissance
period to the end of the 19th century 

78
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,320
and even now to some extent,
but it's not just French.

79
00:03:44,321 --> 00:03:48,130
There's also a lot of Latin vocabulary,
some Latin enter Germanic dialects.

80
00:03:48,131 --> 00:03:50,500
In the early days through contact with 
the Roman Empire.

81
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:52,780
On top of that,
some Christian missionaries were present

82
00:03:52,781 --> 00:03:54,700
in Britain and the sixth and seventh 
centuries,

83
00:03:54,730 --> 00:03:57,430
and they introduced some Latin religious
vocab into English.

84
00:03:57,490 --> 00:03:58,323
Many Latin words were also borrowed 
during the renaissance period and also 

85
00:04:00,671 --> 00:04:01,504
during the scientific revolution of the 
17th and 18th centuries were many new 

86
00:04:04,721 --> 00:04:06,020
words were coined,
coining,

87
00:04:06,050 --> 00:04:08,530
demeaning,
newly created new words were coined from

88
00:04:08,531 --> 00:04:09,364
Latin roots,
prefixes and suffixes to represent new 

89
00:04:11,261 --> 00:04:13,960
concepts in science and technology and 
an industry.

90
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:15,003
So English is a Germanic language which 
absorbed a huge number of French and 

91
00:04:17,651 --> 00:04:18,850
Latin words.
Yes,

92
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:21,280
basically.
But some people have a different theory.

93
00:04:21,281 --> 00:04:24,190
Some people think that English is 
actually a creole language.

94
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:27,070
There's something called the middle 
English creole hypothesis.

95
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:30,340
There are big differences between old 
English and middle English.

96
00:04:30,341 --> 00:04:33,370
Of course there was the importing of 
lots of French vocabulary,

97
00:04:33,371 --> 00:04:35,680
but that alone does not make it a creole
language.

98
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:36,633
But there were other changes to the 
grammar of English which became highly 

99
00:04:38,741 --> 00:04:41,020
simplified.
There was a lot of simplification,

100
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:43,390
like the loss of most now in cases and 
gender,

101
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:47,410
so that aside from the possessive form 
with apostrophe s and the plural forms,

102
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:49,810
most nouns in English don't have any 
inflection.

103
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:51,970
Also,
adjectives used to have inflection,

104
00:04:51,971 --> 00:04:52,804
but that disappeared to the word.
Inflection means changes to a word to 

105
00:04:55,721 --> 00:04:57,790
represent different grammatical 
categories.

106
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:00,550
For example,
the word cat and the cat's paw here,

107
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:03,550
the apostrophe s is a kind of inflection
to show possession.

108
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:04,503
And we have one most but two mice.
So here the word is inflected to show 

109
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:08,673
plural.
So let's take a simple phrase like the 

110
00:05:10,931 --> 00:05:13,630
good king and look at it in old English,
in old English.

111
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:14,493
Notice that all three words in this 
phrase can change in the nominative 

112
00:05:16,901 --> 00:05:19,840
case,
say Gold Cuny in the accusative case,

113
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:22,600
thrown a golden human in the genitive 
case.

114
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,990
Fast golden keuning is in the date of 
case Fem,

115
00:05:25,991 --> 00:05:26,824
golden tuning.
So the definite article changes the 

116
00:05:28,691 --> 00:05:31,630
adjective changes and the noun changes 
depending on the case,

117
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:32,553
but the article and adjective also 
changed depending on the gender and the 

118
00:05:34,961 --> 00:05:36,880
case endings are different depending on 
the gender.

119
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:39,890
Let's look at a similar phrase,
the good Queen Sale.

120
00:05:39,891 --> 00:05:40,724
Goal Day Quinn thought gold on Quinn 
thought a go down Quinn and thought I'd 

121
00:05:44,191 --> 00:05:45,024
go down.
Quinn,

122
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:48,490
notice the different feminine form of 
the definite article and the adjective.

123
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:52,630
This is just an example of the 
grammatical complexity of old English.

124
00:05:52,631 --> 00:05:56,050
So you can imagine how much it became 
simplified by the middle English period.

125
00:05:56,051 --> 00:05:58,850
Most of these farms disappeared or 
merged together.

126
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:02,270
Now we just have a genitive case and the
others form a common case.

127
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:05,390
This is the type of simplification that 
happens when creoles arise.

128
00:06:05,450 --> 00:06:06,283
So it's very possible that old English 
underwent a process of creolization 

129
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:10,243
inserting lots of French vocabulary into
an old English substrate or underlying 

130
00:06:14,241 --> 00:06:15,074
structure,
but there might have been a different 

131
00:06:15,951 --> 00:06:17,660
reason for that simplification of 
English.

132
00:06:17,661 --> 00:06:21,140
Some people don't believe in the creole 
hypothesis and they point to things like

133
00:06:21,141 --> 00:06:23,810
some of the irregular forms that still 
exist in English,

134
00:06:23,811 --> 00:06:26,330
like irregular verbs or irregular plural
forms.

135
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:29,660
In a typical creole language,
those forms would have been regularized,

136
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:33,230
but of course creolization is not an all
or nothing process.

137
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:35,900
It's possible that English was partially
realized.

138
00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:36,883
Well,
let's look at a couple of sentences in 

139
00:06:38,061 --> 00:06:40,370
English and let's look at the influences
we can find.

140
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:43,250
Let's see if there's more dramatic or 
more romance influence.

141
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:44,143
This one's a newspaper headline.
Trump pushing immigration plan meets 

142
00:06:46,761 --> 00:06:49,070
with family of women,
killed in 2007.

143
00:06:49,190 --> 00:06:51,170
Push.
This word comes from old French,

144
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:54,320
pulled say,
or modern French poussey immigration.

145
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:57,500
This word comes from Latin [inaudible].
Good optimum plan.

146
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:01,850
This word comes from the French word,
which means map or ground plan meet.

147
00:07:01,910 --> 00:07:02,743
This comes from old English,
Mayton with this comes from old English 

148
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:06,313
with family.
This comes from the Latin Familia 

149
00:07:08,570 --> 00:07:11,390
according to the source I used,
but there's also the French word for me,

150
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:15,020
which I suppose could be the source of 
this word comes from the old English,

151
00:07:15,290 --> 00:07:17,960
F or off woman.
This comes from old English.

152
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:19,940
We men or women kill.

153
00:07:20,090 --> 00:07:23,270
This might come from the old English 
Quillan to quell in.

154
00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:26,450
This word comes from Latin,
so out of those 10 words,

155
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:29,000
five are dramatic and five are romance 
words,

156
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:30,583
but let's have a look at a more casual 
sentence because I have a feeling that 

157
00:07:32,901 --> 00:07:33,734
newspaper vocabulary tends towards 
romance vocabulary more than common 

158
00:07:36,831 --> 00:07:37,664
speech.
I had lunch with my friend and we read 

159
00:07:38,841 --> 00:07:40,850
some books I have.
This is dramatic.

160
00:07:40,970 --> 00:07:43,220
Comes from old English.
Each had.

161
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:45,590
This is also dramatic.
It comes from old English,

162
00:07:45,650 --> 00:07:48,590
have been lunch.
The origin of this one is vague,

163
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:50,930
but it seems to be from a modern English
dialect.

164
00:07:50,931 --> 00:07:53,750
Word with this is from old English with 
mine.

165
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:54,613
This is dramatic.
It comes from middle English or means 

166
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:58,333
friend.
This comes from old English phrase and 

167
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:02,680
this comes from old English,
Ond,

168
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:05,480
or owned we.
This comes from old English way.

169
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:08,060
Read this comes from old English at that
done,

170
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:09,270
or they've done some.

171
00:08:09,410 --> 00:08:13,220
This comes from old English book.
This comes from old English book,

172
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:17,000
so this time all of the words are almost
all of the words are Germanic,

173
00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:17,983
so it's interesting that the majority of
English vocabulary comes from French or 

174
00:08:20,601 --> 00:08:21,434
from Latin,
but in the most commonly used words in 

175
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,513
casual speech,
there tends to be more dramatic 

176
00:08:26,031 --> 00:08:26,864
vocabulary and this is a good argument 
in favor of English being classified as 

177
00:08:29,991 --> 00:08:30,824
a Germanic language.
So do I think that English should be 

178
00:08:32,661 --> 00:08:34,550
classified as a Germanic language?
Well,

179
00:08:34,551 --> 00:08:36,680
by a linguists criteria,
yes,

180
00:08:36,770 --> 00:08:39,770
but most people don't really care about 
the linguists criteria.

181
00:08:39,771 --> 00:08:41,830
They just care about the practical 
application,

182
00:08:41,850 --> 00:08:42,683
the practical use of the language.
And in practice I think the vocabulary 

183
00:08:45,411 --> 00:08:47,180
is a very important element of the 
language.

184
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:51,130
So I think it's fair to say that in 
practice English as a hybrid language,

185
00:08:51,131 --> 00:08:53,120
it's partly Germanic,
partly romance,

186
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:55,070
but that's my personal conclusion.

187
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:55,943
I'd like to know what you think.
Do you think that English should be 

188
00:08:57,541 --> 00:08:58,374
considered a Germanic language or do you
think it seems more like a romance 

189
00:09:00,991 --> 00:09:01,824
language?
