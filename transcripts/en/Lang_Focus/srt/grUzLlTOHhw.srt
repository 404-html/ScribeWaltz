1
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:07,340
Quinn when Nanjie a zine are a queen.
When Umangi a zine or man,

2
00:00:11,071 --> 00:00:13,080
these people in Beijing don't speak 
Chinese.

3
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:18,540
Maybe I need to speak louder.
Queen [inaudible] Queen.

4
00:00:18,541 --> 00:00:19,920
When Angie a zine or

5
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:27,150
[inaudible]

6
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:29,410
guys,
this is Paul.

7
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:33,190
The title of this video is why your 
phrasebook fails you.

8
00:00:33,910 --> 00:00:34,743
A lot of people buy a phrase book right 
before the start of their trip or they 

9
00:00:37,781 --> 00:00:38,614
buy a phrase book at the airport after 
they've checked in for their flight or 

10
00:00:41,171 --> 00:00:44,410
they buy their phrase book after they've
arrived at their destination.

11
00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:45,723
And quite often these people claim that 
there for his book wasn't helpful for 

12
00:00:48,581 --> 00:00:49,414
them,
but didn't help them communicate with 

13
00:00:50,171 --> 00:00:51,004
the locals.
Well of course it didn't because you 

14
00:00:53,591 --> 00:00:57,880
didn't use your phrase book to study.
You didn't use it the right way.

15
00:00:58,060 --> 00:01:00,760
So I would like to call this video 
something else.

16
00:01:00,761 --> 00:01:01,594
I like to call it why you fail your 
phrase book your phrasebook had high 

17
00:01:05,891 --> 00:01:06,724
hopes.
Your phrase book really wanted to be 

18
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:09,850
your sidekick and wanted to help you 
out.

19
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:13,510
Had wanted to be a tool that you used.
It wanted you to take the lead.

20
00:01:13,511 --> 00:01:15,700
So it could do that.
It's best to help you.

21
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:18,880
But unfortunately you let you a phrase 
book down.

22
00:01:18,881 --> 00:01:19,714
You didn't take the lead,
you tried to give the lead over to the 

23
00:01:22,031 --> 00:01:24,520
phrase book,
expect it to do everything for you.

24
00:01:24,521 --> 00:01:27,010
And I have news for you.
Unfortunately,

25
00:01:27,230 --> 00:01:30,610
phrase books are not human.
They can't take the lead,

26
00:01:30,611 --> 00:01:32,740
they can't communicate for you.
They're just a tool.

27
00:01:32,770 --> 00:01:35,410
So you need to use them the right way.

28
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:40,740
Basically,
if you use your phrase book,

29
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:42,950
uh,
to pull phrases out on the fly,

30
00:01:42,970 --> 00:01:45,540
just to look things up when you're going
about your,

31
00:01:45,541 --> 00:01:46,374
your trip,
like you're shopping and you need to 

32
00:01:47,431 --> 00:01:48,264
look something up so you,
you look in the shopping section and 

33
00:01:50,011 --> 00:01:52,050
find a phrase that suitable for what you
need.

34
00:01:52,370 --> 00:01:54,060
Um,
basically it's going to fail you.

35
00:01:54,061 --> 00:01:57,360
It's not going to work like that.
You really need to do this.

36
00:01:57,361 --> 00:01:58,194
You need to use your phrase book as a 
tool to study and learn some of the 

37
00:02:00,841 --> 00:02:02,130
language.
If you do that,

38
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:05,100
then you're going to have a much better 
experience with it.

39
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:09,240
So how can you make your phrase but 
useful as a tool for studying?

40
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:10,103
Well,
the first thing you need to do when you 

41
00:02:12,061 --> 00:02:14,160
start learning a new language,
even with a phrase book,

42
00:02:14,161 --> 00:02:17,250
just for travel purposes,
you need to get the phonology down.

43
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,170
You need to learn the sounds of the 
language,

44
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:21,420
how to understand them,
but how to pronounce them.

45
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,190
That's,
that's point blank.

46
00:02:23,191 --> 00:02:25,410
The number one thing you need to do 
because if you don't,

47
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:26,363
nobody's going to understand you and 
you're not going to be able to 

48
00:02:28,441 --> 00:02:29,274
understand them.
It depends on the language to some 

49
00:02:30,451 --> 00:02:31,400
extent.
Like,

50
00:02:31,401 --> 00:02:32,234
uh,
some languages have quite simple 

51
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:34,403
phonological systems,
but if you're learning a language with 

52
00:02:36,271 --> 00:02:37,950
tones or something,
something like that,

53
00:02:37,951 --> 00:02:41,100
that's new to you and you don't put in 
the time to learn that first.

54
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:43,260
And if you just read the phrase out of 
the phrase book,

55
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:44,423
it's not gonna come out the way people 
understand it will just sound like 

56
00:02:47,371 --> 00:02:48,090
jibberish.
Right?

57
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:51,210
So you need to get the phonology down.
You can do that before your trip,

58
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,500
hopefully.
Um,

59
00:02:52,501 --> 00:02:53,334
get on the Internet.
Look for some examples of the 

60
00:02:54,451 --> 00:02:55,350
pronunciation.

61
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:58,050
Um,
take a lesson or two if you can like get

62
00:02:58,051 --> 00:03:01,110
even on Skype,
get a teacher from I talky and uh,

63
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:04,660
take some skype lessons.
They'll help you with the pronunciation.

64
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:08,320
And I've tried to get that down.
Or once you arrive at your destination,

65
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:10,060
talk to a local,
get some help from them.

66
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:12,700
But the point is you need to learn what 
those sounds are,

67
00:03:12,701 --> 00:03:15,580
how to produce them,
practice a bit and get used to that.

68
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,193
So that's the first thing.
The next thing is to learn the basic 

69
00:03:19,751 --> 00:03:23,230
sentence patterns of the language.
Now for his books are great because they

70
00:03:23,231 --> 00:03:27,850
have tons of examples of basic sentence 
patterns right now.

71
00:03:27,851 --> 00:03:28,684
So you can just read through them and 
you can get a sense for how to build 

72
00:03:30,911 --> 00:03:33,130
simple sentences.
Some people are like me,

73
00:03:33,131 --> 00:03:33,964
they're kind of inductive learners.
They like to just look at the examples 

74
00:03:36,431 --> 00:03:38,620
that figure it out,
look at the examples and we think,

75
00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:40,030
hm,
this must be the subject.

76
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:42,070
This must be the object,
this must be the bourbon.

77
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,113
We like to figure it out from examples 
and compare different examples and see 

78
00:03:46,151 --> 00:03:49,330
what goes where and learn how to piece 
together sentences.

79
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:51,520
So if you're an inductive learner like 
that,

80
00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:52,383
then you can just flip through it,
look at similar sentences and try to 

81
00:03:54,401 --> 00:03:55,990
figure out what parts mean,
what,

82
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,700
learn how to build the sentences 
yourself.

83
00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:01,120
Some people are not like that.
They're more productive learners.

84
00:04:01,121 --> 00:04:04,000
They like to have the rule first,
they'd like to know the grammar rule,

85
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:07,600
and then they can look at the examples 
in that makes sense to them because they

86
00:04:07,601 --> 00:04:09,040
already know the rule,
right?

87
00:04:09,041 --> 00:04:11,050
Some people are more like that,
so if you'd like that,

88
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:12,513
no problem.
Because most phrase books have a pretty 

89
00:04:13,691 --> 00:04:16,750
good grammar section.
It's short usually,

90
00:04:16,751 --> 00:04:17,584
but it gives you the basics.
Just the basic enough explanation to 

91
00:04:20,261 --> 00:04:22,060
understand the examples,
to read that.

92
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:23,193
Then flip through the book,
find examples and try to match them up 

93
00:04:26,681 --> 00:04:28,840
with the rules and see how they make 
sense to you.

94
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:31,780
So get the sentence structure down.
That's the second thing.

95
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:34,390
The third thing,
a third thing is vocab.

96
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,130
Get some vocabulary,
right?

97
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:38,980
Phrase books are good because they have 
every day vocabulary.

98
00:04:38,981 --> 00:04:39,814
It's you'd stuff that's useful in 
regular daily life situations and you 

99
00:04:43,121 --> 00:04:45,530
can look up different kinds of topics.
Uh,

100
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:47,830
phrase books are usually arranged by 
topic or subject,

101
00:04:47,831 --> 00:04:50,440
right?
So there's a section on maybe like going

102
00:04:50,441 --> 00:04:52,180
out and partying,
that's like one section.

103
00:04:52,181 --> 00:04:55,720
So some of the phrases might be like how
to order a drink or how to talk to a new

104
00:04:55,721 --> 00:04:56,554
person in the bar or something.
Then there might be a section on going 

105
00:04:59,321 --> 00:05:01,240
to the hospital if you're someone with 
an illness,

106
00:05:01,241 --> 00:05:02,680
right?
And you can look up that section.

107
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:06,670
So whatever vocabulary you might need in
Europe,

108
00:05:06,671 --> 00:05:10,750
kind of travel or um,
for your own lifestyle or whatever,

109
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:13,600
then you can look up that vocab and you 
can learn it.

110
00:05:14,170 --> 00:05:16,930
So the way I like to learn vocabulary is
using,

111
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:18,400
well,
it's one way,

112
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:19,234
it's just kind of a shortcut method,
I guess you can put it into a chunky 

113
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:25,240
monkey is a flashcard system.
Um,

114
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:29,050
it's this flashcard application for your
smart phone or also on the computer.

115
00:05:29,051 --> 00:05:31,120
You can get it for free.
It's free on Android,

116
00:05:31,121 --> 00:05:32,140
on,
uh,

117
00:05:32,170 --> 00:05:34,360
on Ios.
You've got to pay some money for it,

118
00:05:34,361 --> 00:05:35,530
but it's worth it.
It's awesome.

119
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:36,813
So you can build up a basic vocabulary,
load those words into a Hanky and enjoy 

120
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,313
yourself on them.
So words or phrases or even full 

121
00:05:43,301 --> 00:05:45,400
sentences if you are getting to that 
point,

122
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:48,280
load them in and then drill yourself on 
those vocab.

123
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:51,370
So you can do that one of the plan.
You can do that whenever you've got free

124
00:05:51,371 --> 00:05:52,390
time,
uh,

125
00:05:52,391 --> 00:05:53,224
on keys.
Awesome.

126
00:05:53,530 --> 00:05:56,860
So you can just look through the phrase 
book based on topic,

127
00:05:56,970 --> 00:06:01,510
on based on just what everyday words you
think you will need a little demand.

128
00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:02,630
Study them.
Okay,

129
00:06:02,631 --> 00:06:04,700
so that's the three things.
Get the phonology down,

130
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:07,100
get a sense for the basic sentence 
structure,

131
00:06:07,101 --> 00:06:09,830
get some basic vocabulary.
And once you have those things,

132
00:06:09,831 --> 00:06:12,640
then now you've used the phrase book 
well at,

133
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:15,050
and now you're in a good position to 
look stuff up.

134
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:15,973
If you need something on the fly,
if you try to look stuff up on the fly 

135
00:06:19,011 --> 00:06:21,560
without having any basic understanding 
of the language yet,

136
00:06:21,561 --> 00:06:23,840
then you're not going to understand 
their response,

137
00:06:23,841 --> 00:06:27,620
even if they understood you.
So you've got to do some studying.

138
00:06:27,621 --> 00:06:31,280
Use it as a tool to learn,
not just as some kind of little,

139
00:06:31,281 --> 00:06:32,114
a magic,
a magic toy that's going to speak for 

140
00:06:35,421 --> 00:06:36,254
you and get the job done for you.
Now you've got to put in the effort 

141
00:06:38,091 --> 00:06:40,040
yourself,
and that's the fun of it.

142
00:06:40,041 --> 00:06:40,874
That's what makes communicating fun.
That's where it makes learning a 

143
00:06:42,951 --> 00:06:45,230
language fun.
So do it yourself.

144
00:06:45,231 --> 00:06:46,970
Don't expect the phrase book to do it 
for you.

145
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:50,390
All right?
That's the basic message later,

146
00:06:56,890 --> 00:06:58,310
we just edit that part out so.
