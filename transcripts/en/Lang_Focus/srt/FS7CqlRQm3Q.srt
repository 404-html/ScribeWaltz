Hello everyone,
welcome to the Lange Focus Channel and 

2
00:00:03,371 --> 00:00:08,371
my name is Paul and welcome to another 
edition of mystery languages.

3
00:00:08,710 --> 00:00:11,560
If this is your first time watching a 
mystery languages video,

4
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:12,443
they'd let me tell you how it goes.
I'll play you a sample of a language or 

5
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:16,173
a couple of samples of a language and 
you can listen and guess what each 

6
00:00:18,881 --> 00:00:22,270
language might be.
You might not get the exact language,

7
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:25,750
but you might get the region or the 
language family or something like that,

8
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:26,613
and that's a partial success in itself.
Today's language samples were submitted 

9
00:00:29,801 --> 00:00:30,634
by Lang focus viewers via instagram,
so I'm especially excited about today's 

10
00:00:34,091 --> 00:00:36,790
episode,
so let's get started.

11
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:38,610
Please listen.
Yes,

12
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:39,453
some of upper management Snow Heidi,
who never came in Kakapo cookie bites 

13
00:00:46,851 --> 00:00:50,300
one year ago.
Has that thought about tune on united.

14
00:00:50,301 --> 00:00:53,630
I live Aristo covered cocky,
mucin,

15
00:00:53,631 --> 00:00:57,230
and lookup.
What's a good had not hired?

16
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:01,420
Now let's look at a few samples with 
writing.

17
00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:04,750
Yes.
The gunnel mechanic authority boost.

18
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:09,830
Not good care there today.
Yes.

19
00:01:09,831 --> 00:01:10,641
Chimp,
Joshy,

20
00:01:10,641 --> 00:01:11,660
ICA echo.

21
00:01:12,550 --> 00:01:14,740
So what language do you think it might 
be?

22
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:26,100
The language is Armenian.
Armenian is the official language of the

23
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:27,693
Republic of Armenia,
but more than half of it speakers live 

24
00:01:29,141 --> 00:01:31,870
in other countries in Armenian minority 
communities.

25
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:35,320
It's a member of the Indo European 
language family,

26
00:01:35,321 --> 00:01:36,154
but it forms its own branch of Indo 
European because it's linked to other 

27
00:01:39,161 --> 00:01:41,170
languages in the family are not really 
known,

28
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:44,830
but it has borrowed a large amount of 
vocabulary from Persian,

29
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:48,040
so Persian speakers might recognize a 
lot of words in Armenian.

30
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:52,060
The stress and Armenian generally falls 
on the final syllable of the word.

31
00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:53,920
Not always,
but it usually does,

32
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:57,910
unless the word has the definite article
or a possessive adjective at the end.

33
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:01,200
If we read along with the sentences we 
heard before,

34
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:03,810
we can notice that the stress usually 
comes at the end.

35
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,100
Yes,
mechanic authority.

36
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:06,953
How boost

37
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:08,063
on this recording this word sounds like 
it has the stress on the first syllable 

38
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:14,640
like Connie,
but in other sources it sounds more like

39
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:16,890
Connie with the stress on the second 
syllable.

40
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:21,860
That might depend on the sentence level.
Stress of the sentence as a whole.

41
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:23,780
Not Good.
Kevin,

42
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:26,120
today.
Yes.

43
00:02:26,121 --> 00:02:26,950
Chimp,
Joshy,

44
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:27,783
ICA.

45
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:32,240
There are two standard varieties of 
Armenian western Armenian,

46
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:35,390
eastern Armenian,
which have some significant differences.

47
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:38,900
The variety that you heard in the 
samples was eastern Armenian.

48
00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:40,003
This map shows the distribution of 
western Armenian and eastern Armenian 

49
00:02:43,011 --> 00:02:45,470
dialects at the beginning of the 20th 
century,

50
00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:49,580
but most speakers of western Armenian 
now live in diaspora communities.

51
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:51,800
Okay.
Now onto the next language.

52
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:53,400
Please listen night.

53
00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:58,310
Mr.
Mr Wyangela on where I'm going to say.

54
00:02:58,420 --> 00:02:59,220
Let's see.
One.

55
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:00,380
I ended up repeatedly take old,
worn out.

56
00:03:00,381 --> 00:03:02,720
I don't plan on.
We don't know.

57
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:07,460
We're flying night.
Galileo Galilei Pitney's only leak Amman

58
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:11,550
at Tennessee Pitney.
Pitney Barlett beating the bottle.

59
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:14,760
All of us are not.
Are polycystic comfy together.

60
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:19,020
Amman,
where I in say,

61
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:20,970
I mean not in good.
Tal.

62
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:22,720
Why then?
People are really,

63
00:03:22,721 --> 00:03:23,554
really wicked.
Not.

64
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:24,483
Tell going,
tell about why Sarafina Pitney Garden 

65
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:31,613
Wall.

66
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:34,160
Now let's look at a few more sentences 
with writing.

67
00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:36,540
Meanwhile,
I'm buying some clothes.

68
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:40,110
She borrowed the book from the library.
Me.

69
00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:41,950
Now I'm going on tonight,

70
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,140
so what language could it be?

71
00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:50,500
Cool.

72
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:54,130
The language is Jamaican Patois,
as the name suggests.

73
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:54,993
Jamaican Patois is spoken in Jamaica.
It has around $3 million native 

74
00:03:58,121 --> 00:03:58,954
speakers.
It's an English based creole that 

75
00:04:00,581 --> 00:04:01,414
developed in the 17th and 18th centuries
through contact between African slaves 

76
00:04:05,231 --> 00:04:06,064
and English speaking slave owners.
The official language of Jamaica is 

77
00:04:08,770 --> 00:04:09,603
English and Jamaican.
Patois is spoken on a continuum with 

78
00:04:12,371 --> 00:04:13,204
standard Jamaican English.
That means that in some situations 

79
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,353
speakers will be essentially using 
standard English with a characteristic 

80
00:04:19,391 --> 00:04:20,830
Jamaican accent.
Well,

81
00:04:20,831 --> 00:04:21,664
in other situations,
speakers will mix English with varying 

82
00:04:23,981 --> 00:04:27,280
degrees of Patois and at the very casual
end of the spectrum,

83
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:30,130
speakers might use Jamaican patois 
exclusively.

84
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:32,590
The three sentences that we saw on the 
screen,

85
00:04:32,591 --> 00:04:33,424
we're pretty close to standard English,
but the longer reading that you heard 

86
00:04:36,011 --> 00:04:36,844
was full on Jamaican Patois,
but we do see some grammatical and 

87
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:41,860
phonological changes in those three 
sentences.

88
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:43,420
Take the third one.
For instance,

89
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:45,720
now I'm going on tonight.

90
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:51,020
Jamaican patois uses me as the subject 
pronouns rather than the negative is now

91
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:52,493
instead of not and noticed that there is
a double negative with no being used 

92
00:04:55,981 --> 00:04:56,814
where any would be used in English.
Notice that going to is abbreviated to 

93
00:05:00,290 --> 00:05:01,123
go on and of course the pronunciation is
different to Dina and tonight are close 

94
00:05:05,401 --> 00:05:06,234
to the standard English equivalents just
with slightly different pronunciation 

95
00:05:08,701 --> 00:05:12,180
and spelling to match and onto the next 
language.

96
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:13,103
Please listen.

97
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:19,580
Yeah,
we at the illegal hit on my eggs.

98
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:28,990
Salmon on your Buddha,
Allah Aleda a late hit our,

99
00:05:31,241 --> 00:05:36,241
let's say a Nicholean household in order
to Arizona.

100
00:05:38,570 --> 00:05:39,403
So

101
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:44,310
next we'll look at a few sentences with 
writing.

102
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:45,463
I do.

103
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:48,850
Hi.
I'm able to take away.

104
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:51,030
That's in the morning.
We had AP.

105
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:54,440
So what language could this possibly be?

106
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:05,600
The language is what our need is an 
indigenous language of South America.

107
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:06,493
It's spoken by over 6 million people,
including most of the population of 

108
00:06:09,621 --> 00:06:10,454
Paraguay,
where it's an official language 

109
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:15,110
alongside Spanish.
It's also spoken in parts of neighboring

110
00:06:15,111 --> 00:06:16,460
Argentina,
Bolivia,

111
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:17,353
and Brazil.
It's a member of the Tupi language 

112
00:06:19,311 --> 00:06:20,144
family,
which consists of around 70 languages 

113
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:22,993
scattered throughout South America.
One feature of gluttony that we can 

114
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:30,620
notice is that every syllable consists 
of a consonant plus a vowel or a vowel.

115
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:34,970
A syllable cannot end in a consonant and
there are no consonant clusters.

116
00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:36,043
To me,
this gives the language a pleasant 

117
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:39,590
light,
floating quality kind of sing song me,

118
00:06:39,591 --> 00:06:40,424
but without tones.
Another thing that adds to this quality 

119
00:06:42,921 --> 00:06:44,630
is squat.
On these nasal sounds,

120
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:47,870
guarani has six oral vowels and six 
nasal vowels.

121
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:50,570
Also,
all voiced stops are either pre,

122
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:51,413
nasally,
before an oral vowel or initialized 

123
00:06:53,930 --> 00:06:55,100
before a nasal valve.

124
00:06:56,630 --> 00:07:00,650
There's also nasal harmony,
meaning that stressed nasal vowels cause

125
00:07:00,651 --> 00:07:03,230
other surrounding sounds to become nasal
as well.

126
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:05,630
We can see an example of this in this 
sentence.

127
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:10,120
I do a session on her.
This is the word for clothes and this is

128
00:07:10,121 --> 00:07:13,690
a future efforts showing that the known 
will be obtained in the future.

129
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:17,230
This ethics has a nasal vowel which 
makes the earlier vowels,

130
00:07:17,231 --> 00:07:19,060
nasal as well.
Listen for it.

131
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:21,490
I do,
I do.

132
00:07:23,130 --> 00:07:25,690
All right,
so let's check out one final language.

133
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:27,920
Please listen.
Schumer and Macau,

134
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:29,320
I guess on show,
Maurice,

135
00:07:29,330 --> 00:07:30,900
fair alum,
non show mercy.

136
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:33,950
Maurice Rutherglen,
mosquito ligand faking tele fish.

137
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:39,040
I guess Domico of Mcclellan.
Komatsu is marching on spouse,

138
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:40,753
pre atomic dome fain.
Now let's look at a few samples with 

139
00:07:44,331 --> 00:07:45,164
writing,
but welcome Ada cannock for she lower 

140
00:07:47,851 --> 00:07:49,230
Air Issaquah,
own Liberland,

141
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,480
neve egg,
Dinair gigamon knocked,

142
00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:54,160
so what language do you think it might 
be?

143
00:08:00,490 --> 00:08:03,760
The language is Irish,
as you can probably guess.

144
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:06,100
Irish is the historical language of 
Ireland.

145
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:07,173
It still spoken as a native language 
there by a minority of people and has 

146
00:08:10,391 --> 00:08:13,720
learned as a heritage language by most 
others to varying degrees.

147
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:18,640
It's also known as Irish Gaelic and is a
member of the Celtic language family.

148
00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:20,163
One interesting feature of Irish is that
all consonants have two forms abroad 

149
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:27,370
form and a slender form depending on the
surrounding vowels.

150
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:32,050
There are three broad vowels in three 
slender vowels that determine which form

151
00:08:32,051 --> 00:08:32,884
of the consonant is used.
The slender form of the consonants are 

152
00:08:35,171 --> 00:08:36,004
palatalized,
which generally sounds like a place to 

153
00:08:38,591 --> 00:08:41,140
write after the continent.
If we look at this word,

154
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:44,140
piano,
we see this consonant twice.

155
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:48,400
The first is before a narrow vowel,
and the second is after abroad vowel.

156
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:52,060
The broad form is God,
but the narrow form is like,

157
00:08:52,430 --> 00:08:53,263
ha ha.
There are similar Paris for all 

158
00:08:56,151 --> 00:08:56,984
continents.
We can see another example of this in 

159
00:08:59,811 --> 00:09:03,950
the word junior.
The d sound is next to a narrow vowel,

160
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:08,420
so what's palatalized like deer or Jay 
Vignette yet?

161
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:12,280
I don't know if all speakers say the 
narrow consonants the same way and to be

162
00:09:12,281 --> 00:09:13,114
honest,
I can't hear it in this word on the 

163
00:09:14,291 --> 00:09:15,490
recording.
We listened to it,

164
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:18,400
but I can hear it in this sample from 
the [inaudible] website.

165
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:26,310
10 Deanna,
the genius in this sample.

166
00:09:30,891 --> 00:09:33,980
We can hear the narrow d sound as well 
as a narrow end,

167
00:09:34,010 --> 00:09:35,520
which makes the sound.
Yeah.

168
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:39,120
Well,
that's all for today's mystery languages
