Hey,
guess what,

2
00:00:01,110 --> 00:00:05,120
a few weeks ago I finished the Esperanto
skill tree on Duolingo,

3
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:07,710
as you can see right here from the 
golden calf.

4
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:09,780
Uh,
I mean owl.

5
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:14,990
Sorry.
Hello everyone.

00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:18,270
Welcome to the Lange Focus Channel and 
my name is Paul.

Today I want to talk about duo lingo.
It's an application for learning 

8
00:00:22,531 --> 00:00:25,680
languages that now has over $100 million
users.

9
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:26,813
I've been using it for a few months and 
it's really an effective way to learn a 

10
00:00:29,431 --> 00:00:32,970
language for free or so they say 
nothing.
