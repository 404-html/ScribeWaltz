1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:02,610
Philippians,
I love the Philippines.

2
00:00:02,611 --> 00:00:03,444
I've been there three times already.
I'm probably going there for a fourth 

3
00:00:06,181 --> 00:00:11,181
time pretty soon.
Good evening everyone.

4
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:19,050
Welcome to my office space slash 
language lab.

5
00:00:19,051 --> 00:00:19,884
This is where I do my work.
This is where I study when I'm studying 

6
00:00:23,101 --> 00:00:24,310
a language.
Um,

7
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:27,080
and I wanted to talk to you about,
uh,

8
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:28,013
the next language that I'm thinking of 
picking up the language or the main 

9
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:35,100
national language of this place,
which is Philippians.

10
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:38,430
I love the Philippines.
I've been there three times already.

11
00:00:38,431 --> 00:00:41,040
I'm probably going there for a fourth 
time pretty soon,

12
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:43,770
so I thought it might be fun to learn a 
bit.

13
00:00:43,771 --> 00:00:47,070
It's a catalog.
I don't actually have to really learn it

14
00:00:47,071 --> 00:00:51,990
because most people in Philippines speak
English really quite well.

15
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:53,093
Not everyone,
but most people speak English well 

16
00:00:55,261 --> 00:00:57,000
enough that I don't need to learn 
tagalog,

17
00:00:57,060 --> 00:00:57,893
but if I'm going to spend that much time
in the Philippines then it would make 

18
00:01:01,621 --> 00:01:05,040
sense to,
to try to learn some of the language and

19
00:01:05,041 --> 00:01:07,500
just have some fun with it and see how 
far they take it.

20
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:08,633
My main project right now is French,
so tagalog catalogs not going to be my 

21
00:01:12,091 --> 00:01:14,220
main thing,
but I want it to give it a go,

22
00:01:14,221 --> 00:01:16,890
have some fun with it and if I go back 
there numerous times,

23
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:17,753
maybe I'll study and improve a little 
bit each time and just have that basic 

24
00:01:21,691 --> 00:01:25,170
knowledge I can use.
So let's have a look at how I'm going to

25
00:01:25,171 --> 00:01:26,220
do it.
Where I'm going to start.

26
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:28,713
Okay.
We're going to jump right into my 

27
00:01:30,271 --> 00:01:32,910
computer just like this.
Here we go.

28
00:01:33,690 --> 00:01:36,150
Alright.
So here we are inside my computer.

29
00:01:36,151 --> 00:01:41,110
You can see I'm on a page right here 
with this image of a pimsleur program.

30
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:41,993
This is pimsleur Tagalog.
Pimsleur is a language course that is 

31
00:01:45,121 --> 00:01:47,970
all audio.
You don't use any text.

32
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,880
Usually you don't learn the grammar 
explicitly.

33
00:01:50,881 --> 00:01:51,714
You just,
uh,

34
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:55,470
you learned through listening and 
responding and repeating with the CD.

35
00:01:56,190 --> 00:01:59,160
Now it,
they market it really heavily and they,

36
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:02,730
they talked like this one program will 
make you fluent and stuff,

37
00:02:02,731 --> 00:02:03,564
but it's not the be all end all.
But I really like to use some kind of 

38
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:10,410
audio program at the beginning when I 
start learning a language because I want

39
00:02:10,411 --> 00:02:13,260
to get familiar with the phonology,
the sounds,

40
00:02:13,261 --> 00:02:14,094
the pronunciation quite quickly,
both for understanding them and for 

41
00:02:17,791 --> 00:02:19,900
producing them.
Uh,

42
00:02:19,901 --> 00:02:23,220
so I like to get some program like this 
so I can focus on the cds,

43
00:02:23,221 --> 00:02:25,290
learn them,
go over them a few times if I need to.

44
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:27,720
Uh,
this one is 30 lessons,

45
00:02:27,721 --> 00:02:31,230
so it usually takes like a month if you 
do one lesson per day.

46
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:32,513
Uh,
but after I do the first couple of 

47
00:02:34,561 --> 00:02:36,870
lessons and just get familiar with the 
basic sounds,

48
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:39,840
then I'm going to,
I'll keep doing this program.

49
00:02:39,841 --> 00:02:43,740
But after the first couple of lessons,
I'm going to find a teacher so I can get

50
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:49,010
some more practice producing the 
language and using it a building my oral

51
00:02:49,561 --> 00:02:50,730
communication skills.

52
00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:52,920
So I'm going to use something called Iot
Talky,

53
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:54,023
which is a,
it's a website that matches you with 

54
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:59,800
tutors or teachers of the language want 
to learn.

55
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:02,680
So there's a scroll down the list here,
a dropdown menu.

56
00:03:02,681 --> 00:03:04,960
You can find the language of your 
choice.

57
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:05,853
Here is fulfilled Pino or Tagalog,
so let's click on that and I want 

58
00:03:09,101 --> 00:03:12,910
someone who also speaks English.
That's most people in Philippines,

59
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:16,780
so let's browse and see how many 
teachers are available.

60
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:18,433
All right.
We could see there are a lots of Gallo 

61
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:25,930
teachers available and the prices are 
very good.

62
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:30,670
Fit for this is like five to $10.
This is $5 per hour.

63
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:36,870
This woman charges six to $9 per hour,
basically about $5 per hour.

64
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:42,300
So the prices are awesome because 
Philippines is a developing country,

65
00:03:42,401 --> 00:03:43,234
so to them maybe that's good money,
but it's important to point out that 

66
00:03:47,081 --> 00:03:48,220
these are our tutors.

67
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:51,850
They're not always professional teachers
who give you a structured lesson,

68
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:54,730
but that's what I want.
I want someone to practice speaking with

69
00:03:54,790 --> 00:03:55,623
just so I can practice making sentences,
practice getting exposure to the 

70
00:03:59,021 --> 00:04:04,021
language that I hear and can produce it 
with someone and see if they understand.

71
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:07,270
So it's all about building oral 
communication skills.

72
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:09,970
So step one is get familiar with the 
sound.

73
00:04:09,971 --> 00:04:10,804
Step two is find a teacher.
Start to produce the language and use 

74
00:04:12,971 --> 00:04:16,990
the sounds and learn to understand them.
In a speaking situation,

75
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:20,650
another resource I'm going to use is 
this,

76
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:24,830
this is the lonely planet Filipino or 
Tagalog phrase book.

77
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:26,553
I really liked using phrase books when I
start learning a language because they 

78
00:04:29,981 --> 00:04:30,814
give me a lot of examples of very simple
basic sentences so it gives me a good 

79
00:04:35,171 --> 00:04:36,004
chance to internalize the sentence 
structure so I can just go over 

80
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:39,850
examples,
examples,

81
00:04:39,851 --> 00:04:40,684
examples with simple vocabulary and then
I can start to substitute some of the 

82
00:04:44,411 --> 00:04:45,244
words,
change out the words to make my own 

83
00:04:46,451 --> 00:04:50,350
sentences following the same pattern of 
the sentence that's right in front of me

84
00:04:50,351 --> 00:04:51,184
and the book and also you have the 
English right next to the language so 

85
00:04:54,641 --> 00:04:55,450
you can.

86
00:04:55,450 --> 00:04:56,283
You can compare the sentences and figure
out which words mean what in the other 

87
00:04:59,561 --> 00:05:02,080
language.
So that gives you a good sense of how to

88
00:05:02,081 --> 00:05:04,540
build sentences from their component 
pieces.

89
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:05,583
So I really liked to do that phrase.
Books are really useful if you use them 

90
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:13,980
correctly in that when I'm also going to
use a more traditional kind of textbook.

91
00:05:14,410 --> 00:05:16,030
This one,
Tagalog for beginners.

92
00:05:16,330 --> 00:05:17,163
I'm going to start with the kindle 
version just because I want to use it 

93
00:05:18,581 --> 00:05:20,800
today and it comes with some audios as 
well.

94
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:22,570
Uh,
if I like it,

95
00:05:22,571 --> 00:05:23,404
I'll get the paper back because I 
generally don't like to get language 

96
00:05:25,841 --> 00:05:27,730
books on kindle,
but I just want it today,

97
00:05:27,731 --> 00:05:31,030
so I'm going to get it.
This one according to the reviews as the

98
00:05:31,031 --> 00:05:32,200
best.
I haven't looked at it,

99
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:35,380
but I'm going to go for this one because
of the reviews.

100
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:37,263
I like to have some kind of traditional 
textbook when I'm studying a language 

101
00:05:40,421 --> 00:05:44,310
because it gives me a bit of that 
conscious understanding of,

102
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:45,880
uh,
of the language.

103
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:49,420
So with the phrase book that can just do
it on my own.

104
00:05:49,421 --> 00:05:50,254
I can figure things out,
but they're always going to be times 

105
00:05:52,601 --> 00:05:56,890
when I'm somewhat confused or I want 
some confirmation of what I'm.

106
00:05:57,230 --> 00:05:58,063
So these traditional textbooks usually 
give you the grammar and the vocabulary 

107
00:06:01,941 --> 00:06:06,110
and all that with some explanation of 
how to use them and what they mean.

108
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:10,820
So I'm going to have those components.
I'm going to have the pimsleur for,

109
00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:11,883
uh,
getting familiar with the sounds of the 

110
00:06:13,101 --> 00:06:15,560
pronunciation.
Then I'm going to find a teacher,

111
00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:16,443
start talking right away.
Then I'm going to use the phrase book 

112
00:06:20,090 --> 00:06:20,923
and I'm going to get familiar with the 
sentence structure and I'm going to do 

113
00:06:23,451 --> 00:06:26,900
some traditional learning study a little
bit in this textbook every day,

114
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:29,000
so those are the things I'm planning to 
do.

115
00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:30,403
I'm going to get started and enjoy 
learning tagalog and we'll see how it 

116
00:06:33,261 --> 00:06:34,200
goes.
Alright,

117
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:37,910
now it's time to edit this video.
Let me move this down.

118
00:06:37,911 --> 00:06:40,940
Here we go.
Let's move this one down here.
