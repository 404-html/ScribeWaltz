Hello everyone.
Welcome to the lane focus channel and my

3
00:00:07,591 --> 00:00:08,424
name is Paul.
Today's topic is the French language or 

4
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:13,943
as it's called in French.
French is a language that really needs 

5
00:00:16,621 --> 00:00:17,454
no introduction.
It's the official language of France of 

6
00:00:19,531 --> 00:00:20,364
course,
but it's an official language of 29 

7
00:00:22,291 --> 00:00:25,110
countries in total.
That includes other countries in Europe,

8
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:26,880
namely Belgium,
Switzerland,

9
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:28,440
Luxembourg,
and Monaco,

10
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:31,350
numerous countries in Africa,
Canada,

11
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:33,720
where it's spoken mainly in the province
of Quebec,

12
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:36,390
the Caribbean,
South America,

13
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:37,703
and the South Pacific.
It's estimated that French is spoken by 

14
00:00:40,711 --> 00:00:43,740
between 80 and 110 million native 
speakers,

15
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:44,753
but that number doesn't give us a full 
picture because between 140 and 180 

16
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:51,450
million people speak it as a second 
language.

17
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:52,373
The majority of them in Africa,
French is also an important language of 

18
00:00:56,671 --> 00:01:00,480
international diplomacy and used to be 
the main global Lingua Franca.

19
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:04,920
French is a member of the Gallo Romance 
Branch of the Romance Language family,

20
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,790
which descended from vulgar Latin,
just like all romance languages did.

21
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:13,230
It's also part of a smaller subset of 
Gallo romance called Lung [inaudible],

22
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:16,830
a dialect continuum in northern France,
southern Belgium,

23
00:01:16,831 --> 00:01:19,120
and the channel islands,
which includes Falciani,

24
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,033
the dialect from which standard French 
derived and it's closest relatives 

25
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:24,323
history in the second century bce 
present de France was part of the goal 

26
00:01:28,561 --> 00:01:30,540
region,
which also included Belgium,

27
00:01:30,541 --> 00:01:31,374
Switzerland,
northern Italy and parts of Germany and 

28
00:01:33,421 --> 00:01:36,330
the Netherlands.
The gold spoke Galician,

29
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:37,193
which was not a unified language,
but rather a series of Celtic languages 

30
00:01:40,501 --> 00:01:43,380
and dialects,
but very little is known about golish.

31
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:44,873
The Roman republic conquered Gaul in the
second and fourth centuries bce and in 

32
00:01:48,991 --> 00:01:49,824
order to become Roman citizens,
goals were required to adopt the Roman 

33
00:01:52,771 --> 00:01:54,570
way of life,
including their language,

34
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:55,433
Latin,
being able to speak Latin became a way 

35
00:01:57,301 --> 00:01:58,134
to gain social status,
economic opportunity and employment in 

36
00:02:00,781 --> 00:02:01,680
the civil service.

37
00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:02,843
Over the next few centuries,
golish Latin bilingualism became more 

38
00:02:05,731 --> 00:02:09,960
common and eventually Latin dominated 
and the golish language has disappeared.

39
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,720
The common people spoke vulgar,
Latin,

40
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:13,753
a vernacular form of Latin that differed
from the formal written language and 

41
00:02:16,531 --> 00:02:19,410
also different from place to place 
throughout the Roman Empire.

42
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:20,453
And I'm feeling Deja Vu right now 
because I think I talk about this in 

43
00:02:22,951 --> 00:02:27,630
every video about a romance language.
Beginning of the year three 75 ce,

44
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:28,613
the GERMANIC invasions began and 
gradually replaced the western Roman 

45
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:33,413
Empire with Germanic Kingdoms.
The fall of the empire accelerated the 

46
00:02:36,241 --> 00:02:39,870
divergence of vulgar Latin into distinct
romantic dialects.

47
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:43,530
The dialects of northern goal,
which would later develop into the lung,

48
00:02:43,531 --> 00:02:44,364
doyle changed more than others because 
of frequent contact with Germanic 

49
00:02:47,401 --> 00:02:49,830
languages like frankish spoken by the 
elite.

50
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,113
The frankish elite spoke both frankish 
and romantic and after a while they 

51
00:02:54,091 --> 00:02:58,020
spoke mainly romantic dialects,
but frankish left an important footprint

52
00:02:58,021 --> 00:02:58,980
on those dialects.

53
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,153
French,
which developed from one of these 

54
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:02,014
romantic dialect,
got approximately 550 words from 

55
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,250
frankish or around 13% of the total 
number of loan words in French,

56
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:12,070
and it's phonology was greatly 
influenced as well.

57
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:13,503
This is a large part of why French 
phonology is so distinct from other 

58
00:03:16,451 --> 00:03:17,284
romance languages.
It developed from the German ised 

59
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:21,490
romantic speech of the Frankish.
He leads,

60
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:24,400
but I'm getting ahead of myself.
Let me back up for a minute.

61
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:26,980
Old French,
romantic dialects.

62
00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:30,550
Gradually grew into distinct languages 
and by the eighth century,

63
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:31,413
the dialects of the northwestern part of
the frankish kingdom grew into a number 

64
00:03:34,751 --> 00:03:38,170
of dialects that are collectively 
referred to as old French,

65
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:40,810
which later began to be called the 
[inaudible].

66
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:41,673
As they developed further,
there was no standard form of old 

67
00:03:44,411 --> 00:03:46,450
French,
but rather a dialect continuum.

68
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:47,583
One of those dialects from Sia,
well spoken in a small area around 

69
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:51,373
Paris,
and it's the old French variety from 

70
00:03:53,021 --> 00:03:56,590
which standard French developed for 
[inaudible] is a modern word.

71
00:03:56,740 --> 00:03:58,930
At the time,
the dialect was actually cold.

72
00:03:58,931 --> 00:04:01,860
Frost sweat that name later evolved into
Francais,

73
00:04:01,861 --> 00:04:03,640
say the name of French.
Today,

74
00:04:03,850 --> 00:04:04,683
the king of the upper classes spoke 
frankish Latin was the language of 

75
00:04:07,601 --> 00:04:08,434
writing and the Coleman people who were 
mostly illiterate spoke one of the 

76
00:04:11,291 --> 00:04:14,530
various dialects,
but over the next few centuries,

77
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:18,760
the upper classes began to speak from 
[inaudible] under King Louie.

78
00:04:18,761 --> 00:04:19,594
The ninth from Sudan gained new prestige
and was adopted by the upper classes in 

79
00:04:23,561 --> 00:04:24,394
cities around the kingdom.
The Coleman people continued to speak 

80
00:04:26,651 --> 00:04:30,460
local dialects and Latin continued to 
serve as the language of education,

81
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:33,400
the courts and academia.
Throughout the Catholic world.

82
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:35,673
Under King Phillip,
the fourth French began to be used as 

83
00:04:37,961 --> 00:04:38,794
the language of official documents and 
government and began to compete with 

84
00:04:41,681 --> 00:04:44,440
Latin as a written language.
Middle French.

85
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,620
During the middle French period,
the French changed dramatically,

86
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:48,513
particularly in its phonology,
but scholars tried to maintain the 

87
00:04:51,161 --> 00:04:51,994
language,
which means that the written French of 

88
00:04:53,201 --> 00:04:56,020
today often reflects the pronunciation 
of French.

89
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:56,853
Before those changes took place,
old French had two cases retained from 

90
00:05:00,431 --> 00:05:02,470
Latin,
but those also disappeared in the middle

91
00:05:02,471 --> 00:05:06,130
French and this resulted in the word 
order of French being more fixed.

92
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:07,173
This was during the renaissance period 
when the cultural dominance of Italy 

93
00:05:10,001 --> 00:05:10,834
influenced French 8,000
Italian vocabulary words entered French 

94
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:18,100
800 of which are still in use today.
In the 16th century,

95
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:18,993
King Francois,
the first sign of the ordinance of 

96
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:21,903
vehicle which made French the official 
language of administration instead of 

97
00:05:25,601 --> 00:05:26,434
Latin.
The Catholic church fought hard against 

98
00:05:28,421 --> 00:05:29,254
this move and didn't want the holy 
scriptures to be translated into common 

99
00:05:32,321 --> 00:05:34,870
languages,
but their efforts ultimately failed.

100
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:36,603
The printing press also helped to spread
French because more people could read 

101
00:05:39,551 --> 00:05:41,320
and understand it.
Then they could Latin.

102
00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:43,630
So publishers printed more books in 
French.

103
00:05:44,290 --> 00:05:45,123
Modern French in the 17th century,
French took the place of Latin as the 

104
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:51,790
Lingua Franca of Europe and the Catholic
world.

105
00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:55,840
This was also the century in which 
grammarians sought to standardize proper

106
00:05:55,841 --> 00:05:56,674
French with the publishing French 
grammars and the Academy Frost says was 

107
00:06:00,171 --> 00:06:01,004
founded in 1635 with the mission of 
promoting proper French and preserving 

108
00:06:04,971 --> 00:06:06,950
that form of the language.
At that time,

109
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:10,730
only a small percentage of the people in
France actually spoken French.

110
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:15,230
Most of them spoke other along the oil.
The other regional varieties of speech.

111
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:16,303
Later in 1880 universal education would 
be established and French would be made 

112
00:06:20,431 --> 00:06:24,650
to the soul language of education and 
the only language permitted to be spoken

113
00:06:24,651 --> 00:06:25,484
at school.
This measure would push standard French 

114
00:06:27,291 --> 00:06:29,840
to be near universally spoken throughout
the country.

115
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:31,093
In the 18th century,
French became the language of 

116
00:06:32,961 --> 00:06:33,794
international diplomacy,
used an international legal documents 

117
00:06:36,651 --> 00:06:40,040
and so on reaching a status similar to 
the status of English.

118
00:06:40,041 --> 00:06:40,874
Today,
French maintained the status until the 

119
00:06:42,891 --> 00:06:44,330
time of the first world war.

120
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:49,040
French may not currently be the most 
widely spoken global Lingua Franca,

121
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:51,110
but it's still an important diplomatic 
language.

122
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:54,950
It's one of the official languages of 
the UN and the European Union,

123
00:06:55,010 --> 00:06:58,460
international courts as well as aid 
agencies and NGO's.

124
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:02,120
Why is French spoken in so many 
countries around the world?

125
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:03,253
That's because in the 17th century,
France began establishing colonies all 

126
00:07:06,351 --> 00:07:07,184
over the globe.
After losing most of these colonies in 

127
00:07:09,171 --> 00:07:10,004
wars with other colonial powers,
France began a second colonial empire 

128
00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:16,640
establishing mainly colonies in Africa,
Southeast Asia,

129
00:07:16,641 --> 00:07:17,474
and the South Pacific.
Aside from a few overseas departments 

130
00:07:20,271 --> 00:07:23,360
and territories of France,
these colonies no longer exist,

131
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:26,390
but French is still spoken in many of 
those places.

132
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:28,153
So what is French like?
French naturally shares a lot in common 

133
00:07:30,981 --> 00:07:33,950
with other romance languages and 
Speakers of romance languages.

134
00:07:33,951 --> 00:07:36,860
We'll find it familiar and 
comprehensible in many ways,

135
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:37,753
especially in its written form.
But it's phonology is quite distinct 

136
00:07:40,731 --> 00:07:41,564
from other romance languages and its 
pronunciation is often not intuitive 

137
00:07:44,751 --> 00:07:45,584
based on the spelling because it's 
orthography often reflect pronunciation 

138
00:07:48,771 --> 00:07:51,650
from an earlier time pronunciation and 
orthography.

139
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:54,800
In old French,
there were diphthongs and trip thongs.

140
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:57,710
But these became simple vowels,
so today in French,

141
00:07:57,740 --> 00:08:00,470
there are vowels that look like 
diphthongs are trip thongs,

142
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:03,380
but represents the vowel sounds.
For example,

143
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:05,373
fruit flir.
You can see that all of these words 

144
00:08:09,201 --> 00:08:12,780
contain a single vowel sound,
but are spelled like diphthongs are trip

145
00:08:12,781 --> 00:08:13,614
thongs.
There were also a number of nasal 

146
00:08:15,531 --> 00:08:16,364
vowels.
Typically when an n or an m comes after 

147
00:08:18,741 --> 00:08:20,510
a vowel,
it's not pronounced,

148
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:23,750
but the proceeding vowel is nasal ised.
For example,

149
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:25,133
from shrimp pumps.
Here's a phrase with several nasal 

150
00:08:29,781 --> 00:08:31,630
vowels.
Bovine below.

151
00:08:33,230 --> 00:08:35,090
There are some exceptions.
For example,

152
00:08:35,091 --> 00:08:38,060
when an adjective or noun takes a 
feminine ending eat,

153
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:42,920
there's shank with a nasal vowel,
but then there's Shin with an oral vowel

154
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:47,390
and an end zone.
There are also a number of diacritics or

155
00:08:47,391 --> 00:08:51,050
written accents in French.
Four of these appear on vowels.

156
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:56,010
The first is the [inaudible] Xle,
or a cute accent,

157
00:08:56,190 --> 00:08:59,730
which is used on the letter e.
This represents an a sound,

158
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:01,770
for example,
Luke ethic.

159
00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:05,400
Then there's the exome glove or grave 
accent.

160
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:06,593
With Anu.
It's used mainly to distinguish between 

161
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:11,100
otherwise,
similarly looking and sounding words.

162
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:12,510
For example,
oop,

163
00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:17,400
meaning where versus Ooh meaning or with
Ie.

164
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:18,293
The grave accent indicates that the 
sound is like the Ian Bet as opposed to 

165
00:09:21,931 --> 00:09:24,720
an e with an acute accent,
which sounds like a,

166
00:09:25,950 --> 00:09:26,783
then there's the excellent dilemma.
This shows that two side by side vowel 

167
00:09:29,821 --> 00:09:32,700
symbols are pronounced independently.
For example,

168
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:33,750
chorus.
He don'ts,

169
00:09:34,130 --> 00:09:38,010
I mean in coincidence.
Then there's the circumflex accent which

170
00:09:38,011 --> 00:09:38,844
can appear on any vowel.
This indicates that the vowel was 

171
00:09:41,041 --> 00:09:43,890
historically followed by an s for 
example.

172
00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:46,110
In fact,
meaning a party.

173
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,273
Just to illustrate,
let's look at the Italian cognates of 

174
00:09:49,171 --> 00:09:50,200
this word,
Huna.

175
00:09:50,210 --> 00:09:51,043
Festa.

176
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:54,780
Notice that there's an s in the Italian 
word in an earlier form of French.

177
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:59,870
There was an s after the eat and before 
the tea siggy or Savilla,

178
00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:02,940
which indicates that the c sounds like 
an s.

179
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:05,213
Please note that the [inaudible] is not 
used when the consonant comes before an 

180
00:10:08,491 --> 00:10:12,630
I or an e because a c in that position 
is always pronounced like an s.

181
00:10:12,631 --> 00:10:13,464
Anyway,
there were also silent consonants in 

182
00:10:16,111 --> 00:10:18,870
French consonants that are written but 
not pronounced.

183
00:10:19,170 --> 00:10:22,020
This includes most consonants that come 
at the end of a word.

184
00:10:22,170 --> 00:10:25,530
For example,
shut hope vet.

185
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,530
There is the masculine form of an 
adjective,

186
00:10:28,830 --> 00:10:33,150
but in the feminine form of adjectives,
the final consonant is pronounced and in

187
00:10:33,151 --> 00:10:37,940
writing and he is placed after it.
So there's fair but that,

188
00:10:38,730 --> 00:10:39,563
but not all final consonants are silent.
Certain consonants are often but not 

189
00:10:42,661 --> 00:10:45,870
always pronounced at the end 
specifically see R,F

190
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:48,990
and l,
the consonants in the word careful.

191
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:54,140
For example,
after the other positive grammar,

192
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:59,040
let's look at word order in very simple 
Svo sentences.

193
00:10:59,070 --> 00:11:01,650
The word order of French is basically 
the same as English.

194
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:02,633
For example,
here's a sentence meaning he likes 

195
00:11:04,081 --> 00:11:06,990
movies.
[inaudible] word for word.

196
00:11:06,991 --> 00:11:10,710
It's he likes the films,
so we have subject,

197
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:11,790
verb,
object,

198
00:11:12,090 --> 00:11:12,923
but already we see that something is 
different from the English sentence 

199
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:17,220
because there's a definite article in 
English.

200
00:11:17,221 --> 00:11:20,760
The definite article would only be used 
to refer to specific films,

201
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:21,743
but in French the definite article is 
also used for general statements like 

202
00:11:24,691 --> 00:11:27,510
this.
Articles in French are somewhat complex.

203
00:11:27,570 --> 00:11:28,403
We'll come back to those a little later.
The word order starts to become more 

204
00:11:31,231 --> 00:11:34,110
different from English when there are 
object pronouns in the sentence.

205
00:11:34,170 --> 00:11:36,570
So there's this sentence,
meaning I see the building,

206
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:40,710
she was worried about smoke,
but then there's jut have one meaning.

207
00:11:40,711 --> 00:11:43,260
I see it word for word,
it's I it.

208
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,153
See,
you see that the object Pronoun comes 

209
00:11:45,991 --> 00:11:47,640
before the verb,
not after it.

210
00:11:48,390 --> 00:11:50,610
And then there are sentences with a 
direct object.

211
00:11:50,611 --> 00:11:52,440
Pronouns end,
an indirect object.

212
00:11:52,441 --> 00:11:56,350
Pronouns [inaudible] this means Paul 
gives me money.

213
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:58,780
Paul to me,
gives some money.

214
00:11:59,230 --> 00:12:02,920
Now let's change the direct object to a 
Pronoun Miller done.

215
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:05,650
This means Paul gives it to me word for 
word.

216
00:12:05,651 --> 00:12:06,484
It's Paul.
To me it gives and if we make it 

217
00:12:09,161 --> 00:12:09,994
negative,
it becomes even more different from 

218
00:12:11,201 --> 00:12:12,034
English.
[inaudible] the [inaudible] and pop 

219
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,110
constitute the negative.
So word for word,

220
00:12:17,111 --> 00:12:21,040
it's Paul negative.
To me it give not.

221
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:22,323
There are more differences beyond these,
but that gives you a bit of an idea for 

222
00:12:24,731 --> 00:12:27,250
now.
Basically the word order is more similar

223
00:12:27,251 --> 00:12:28,084
when there are no object pronouns.
Let's briefly look at a few other 

224
00:12:31,271 --> 00:12:33,370
grammatical features.
A French gender.

225
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:35,800
All nouns have either masculine or 
feminine.

226
00:12:35,801 --> 00:12:36,730
Gender and French.

227
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:37,653
The gender of the noun is also reflected
in articles before the nouns and 

228
00:12:40,841 --> 00:12:43,240
adjectives that modify it.
For example,

229
00:12:43,390 --> 00:12:46,850
the word for hat shut boob is masculine 
Lou Shapiro.

230
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:47,753
Blue means the blue hat,
the definite article and the adjective 

231
00:12:51,101 --> 00:12:55,030
are masculine.
The word for shirt shimmies is feminine.

232
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:57,730
Less should means blue means that the 
blue shirt,

233
00:12:57,970 --> 00:13:01,780
the definite article in the adjective or
feminine articles.

234
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:04,030
There are three types of articles in 
French,

235
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:06,340
definite,
indefinite and partitive.

236
00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:09,100
All three types of articles have 
masculine,

237
00:13:09,101 --> 00:13:13,450
feminine and plural forms and definite 
and positive articles have special forms

238
00:13:13,451 --> 00:13:16,060
before avowal.
What are positive of articles?

239
00:13:16,090 --> 00:13:18,490
You might ask?
Well there indefinite,

240
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:19,383
but they refer to a vague unspecified 
quantity often for food or abstract 

241
00:13:23,531 --> 00:13:25,090
qualities.
For example,

242
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:28,570
[inaudible] you get to meaning I would 
like some cake.

243
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:31,840
The amount of cake is vague,
so we use the part of article.

244
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,153
Nouns are almost always proceeded by 
articles in French unless there's a 

245
00:13:35,981 --> 00:13:36,814
different determiner before the now such
as a possessive pronouns like mine or a 

246
00:13:40,931 --> 00:13:42,790
demonstrative pronouns like that.

247
00:13:44,110 --> 00:13:47,330
Negation before we saw the phrase bone 
in the middle of them,

248
00:13:47,950 --> 00:13:50,920
which is negative with the negation in 
two parts.

249
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:54,130
No and pot,
but it's not always pot that's used.

250
00:13:54,590 --> 00:13:58,000
No [inaudible] means never.
For example,

251
00:13:58,330 --> 00:14:02,400
even a [inaudible] means he never works.
Yeah,

252
00:14:03,230 --> 00:14:05,110
it means nothing.
For example,

253
00:14:05,410 --> 00:14:09,850
an emotional yeah means she eats nothing
or she doesn't eat anything.

254
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:16,100
Best son means nobody.
Zuni Zuni Besson means I saw no one or I

255
00:14:16,451 --> 00:14:17,284
didn't see anyone.
Leon and pest son can also be the 

256
00:14:20,231 --> 00:14:21,064
subject of the sentence best so never 
knew means nobody came and the end of 

257
00:14:25,270 --> 00:14:28,420
CPC means nothing happened.
Verbs.

258
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:31,150
The verb system of French is fairly 
complex.

259
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,520
If we include all of the compound 
tenses,

260
00:14:33,521 --> 00:14:34,354
moods and aspects,
there are 14 tenses plus the imperative 

261
00:14:37,331 --> 00:14:38,164
form.
Let's look at a couple of the basic 

262
00:14:39,431 --> 00:14:40,630
tenses.
He's fucked.

263
00:14:40,631 --> 00:14:44,560
Liz shimmies.
This means he's wearing the shirt is the

264
00:14:44,561 --> 00:14:45,940
present tense.
Third Person,

265
00:14:45,941 --> 00:14:47,710
masculine,
singular conjugation.

266
00:14:48,370 --> 00:14:49,203
But let's change this to the future 
tense means this means he will wear the 

267
00:14:53,361 --> 00:14:54,194
shirt.
Now let's change this to the imperfect 

268
00:14:56,001 --> 00:14:59,180
tense buffet to mean he was wearing the 
shirt.

269
00:14:59,930 --> 00:15:01,090
[inaudible].

270
00:15:01,370 --> 00:15:05,720
The imperfect shows that the action was 
ongoing at a certain point in the past.

271
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:07,393
If you want to express that the action 
was completed at a certain point in the 

272
00:15:10,071 --> 00:15:10,904
past,
you can use the passe composition 

273
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:14,750
bicycle boozy,
either Taylor shoney's,

274
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:15,853
that means he wore the shirt.
You can see that in the past a 

275
00:15:17,901 --> 00:15:20,930
composite,
there is an auxiliary verb of Y,

276
00:15:21,050 --> 00:15:25,040
which means to have and it's followed by
the past participle of the main verb,

277
00:15:25,150 --> 00:15:27,630
Dok Day.
For some verbs in the past,

278
00:15:27,631 --> 00:15:28,464
say composition,
particularly reflexive verbs and those 

279
00:15:30,381 --> 00:15:31,214
showing movement,
a different auxiliary verb is used to 

280
00:15:33,981 --> 00:15:35,300
be.
For example,

281
00:15:35,510 --> 00:15:38,600
eat is salty dynamism.
This means he left the house.

282
00:15:39,290 --> 00:15:44,290
You can see that the auxiliary verb is a
form of ed rather than a voir vocabulary

283
00:15:45,530 --> 00:15:46,363
as a romance language,
most French vocabulary is of Latin 

284
00:15:48,861 --> 00:15:51,380
origin and some of the more modern 
vocabulary.

285
00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:54,350
Our hybrid words built from both Latin 
and Greek roots.

286
00:15:54,650 --> 00:15:57,740
English vocabulary has been greatly 
influenced by French,

287
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:58,633
so English speakers will likely notice a
lot of French words that look like 

288
00:16:01,071 --> 00:16:03,050
English ones,
the way they're pronounced.

289
00:16:03,051 --> 00:16:04,160
However,
it's quite different.

290
00:16:04,310 --> 00:16:05,960
For example,
information,

291
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:08,930
Phil Messer,
danger g,

292
00:16:09,410 --> 00:16:13,010
double dewberry license,
the salts,

293
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:15,193
and there are a significant number of 
false friends between French and 

294
00:16:17,781 --> 00:16:18,614
English.
Words that look the same but actually 

295
00:16:19,941 --> 00:16:21,980
mean something else.
For example,

296
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:27,250
actually actually more active and more 
doesn't mean actually it means currently

297
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:32,600
or right now assist,
assisting a sea state means to attend.

298
00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:37,910
Then there's attend at dawn.
A thumper doesn't mean to attempt.

299
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:38,773
It means to wait.
There are quite a lot of false friends 

300
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:41,624
like this,
so you can never assume that a French 

301
00:16:42,921 --> 00:16:45,710
word has the same meaning as a similar 
looking English word.

302
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:49,880
Now let's look at one final sentence and
see what we find.

303
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:51,013
Here's the sentence,
meaning she went for a walk to the park 

304
00:16:52,941 --> 00:16:55,450
yesterday and sip on Neil back.
Yeah,

305
00:16:55,850 --> 00:16:56,683
word for word.
It's she herself took for a walk to the 

306
00:16:59,331 --> 00:17:02,420
park yesterday.
L is the third person.

307
00:17:02,421 --> 00:17:03,710
Feminine,
Singular Pronouns.

308
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:07,280
Next we have the verb phrase and this 
year as a reflexive verb,

309
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:10,700
sip is the third person.
Pronouns used for reflexives.

310
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:14,270
It means herself or himself.
Next we have the third person,

311
00:17:14,271 --> 00:17:15,104
singular present tense form of Ed.
This is used as the auxiliary verb for 

312
00:17:18,381 --> 00:17:19,214
the passe composite for reflexive verbs 
come [inaudible] is the past participle 

313
00:17:23,571 --> 00:17:26,090
of the main verb.
This is the feminine singular form,

314
00:17:26,091 --> 00:17:28,850
which takes an extra e at the end by 
itself.

315
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:31,520
It's a transitive verb,
meaning to take for a walk,

316
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:34,490
but the reflexive form used here means 
to go for a walk.

317
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:38,930
Here we have a preposition meaning to 
the two by itself is ah,

318
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:42,140
but when used before the masculine 
singular definite article,

319
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,850
they are replaced by bull.

320
00:17:43,910 --> 00:17:44,743
For Feminine Singular,
it would be alive and for plural it 

321
00:17:47,421 --> 00:17:50,790
would be,
oh fuck is the noun meeting park.

322
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:55,620
So this whole phrase means to the park.
Yes is the advert meaning yesterday.

323
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:57,533
As you can see,
French is a very interesting language 

324
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:01,500
for speakers of English or romance 
languages.

325
00:18:01,650 --> 00:18:04,710
There are probably many elements of 
French that seemed familiar,

326
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:07,200
but then when you get into the details 
of the language,

327
00:18:07,230 --> 00:18:10,170
there might be aspects that seem complex
or challenging,

328
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:14,040
but French is a highly rewarding 
language and by learning French you will

329
00:18:14,041 --> 00:18:16,560
not only be able to communicate with 
French speakers,

330
00:18:16,561 --> 00:18:20,400
but you will also open the door to a 
whole new world of culture,

331
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:21,660
literature,
cinema,

332
00:18:21,661 --> 00:18:22,494
and history.
The question of the day for native 

333
00:18:24,721 --> 00:18:25,554
speakers of French.
In this video I focused mainly on 

334
00:18:27,661 --> 00:18:29,250
standard Parisian,
French,

335
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:31,500
but what regional differences are you 
aware of?

336
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:34,320
Are there any differences in the French 
spoken at Belgium,

337
00:18:34,321 --> 00:18:35,520
Switzerland,
Quebec,

338
00:18:35,550 --> 00:18:37,680
et Cetera,
and for learners of French?

339
00:18:37,710 --> 00:18:38,543
What aspects of French have you found 
challenging and how have you dealt with 

340
00:18:41,131 --> 00:18:41,964
those challenges?
