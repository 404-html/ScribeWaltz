Hello everyone,
this is the lane focus channel.

2
00:00:02,491 --> 00:00:04,650
My name is Paul.
Thank you for tuning in.

3
00:00:05,110 --> 00:00:05,943
Okay.
When refining and improving your own 

4
00:00:07,801 --> 00:00:08,634
approach to learning languages,
it's always great to look at people who 

5
00:00:11,311 --> 00:00:12,144
have done it before.
People have already done it very 

6
00:00:13,921 --> 00:00:16,080
successfully and model what they're 
doing,

7
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:19,380
copy what they're doing,
copied their strategies for learning and

8
00:00:19,381 --> 00:00:21,150
their approach to learning,
their attitudes,

9
00:00:21,151 --> 00:00:21,984
to learning all of those things.
I've met a lot of people who are great 

10
00:00:25,141 --> 00:00:25,974
with languages while traveling and also 
in my regular life and I'd like to talk 

11
00:00:29,671 --> 00:00:30,504
about a couple of particularly 
impressive people that we can learn 

12
00:00:32,731 --> 00:00:36,360
something from now.
This goes back to my first time visiting

13
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:40,420
Egypt in 1997.
I was in a backpack of resort called the

14
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:41,273
hub and I met a number of Bedouin girls 
who were there just selling bracelets 

15
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:49,200
that were selling little trinkets,
souvenirs to tourists like me.

16
00:00:49,450 --> 00:00:52,830
We would go and sit on the beach and 
these little beach side restaurant,

17
00:00:52,870 --> 00:00:53,703
a cushions laid out on the beach.
People would serve you food and these 

18
00:00:56,311 --> 00:00:57,144
better when girls would just wander in 
off the street and try to sell us 

19
00:00:59,341 --> 00:01:02,430
bracelets.
Now what was interesting was I sat there

20
00:01:02,431 --> 00:01:03,264
and I watched these girls switch between
multiple different languages in the 

21
00:01:06,061 --> 00:01:08,190
space of like five minutes.
I would give them,

22
00:01:08,191 --> 00:01:12,000
speak English with lots of people.
Then they would switch to French without

23
00:01:12,001 --> 00:01:14,160
skipping a beat and then they would 
switch to Spanish.

24
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:16,500
They would switch to Italian,
they would switch to Hebrew,

25
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:18,930
they would switch to numerous different 
languages.

26
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:19,853
German,
uh,

27
00:01:19,910 --> 00:01:22,770
I think I even heard them speak Korean 
and Japanese now.

28
00:01:22,771 --> 00:01:25,020
I was wondering how would these young 
girls,

29
00:01:25,021 --> 00:01:28,470
like eight year old bedouin girls who 
probably don't have much education,

30
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:29,513
how would they be able to speak eight 
different languages or 10 different 

31
00:01:32,071 --> 00:01:33,420
languages or whatever it was.

32
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:34,553
So that got me thinking about what makes
them successful and great with 

33
00:01:37,501 --> 00:01:39,360
languages.
So how do they do it?

34
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:40,223
How do these eight year old Bedouin 
girls learn languages way better than 

35
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:45,780
your average college student in the 
Western World?

36
00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:48,420
Well,
I think there were three main areas that

37
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:51,780
I identified that we can learn from when
we look at these girls.

38
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:55,020
The first one is obviously their 
motivation,

39
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:57,990
right?
They have a strong economic incentive to

40
00:01:57,991 --> 00:02:00,690
learn that language.
They come from a poor background.

41
00:02:00,691 --> 00:02:03,600
They live in a poor area or your only 
source of income.

42
00:02:03,601 --> 00:02:06,210
Their source of their livelihood is 
tourism.

43
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,073
They have to speak foreign languages in 
order to get by and the more languages 

44
00:02:09,991 --> 00:02:10,824
they can speak,
the more potential customers they can 

45
00:02:12,511 --> 00:02:14,820
communicate with,
the more money they bring up,

46
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:18,750
so they have that economic incentive.
Most of us living in the west,

47
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:21,240
we already have quite a cushy existence.

48
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:26,130
We can't quite imagine what it's like to
have that economic motivation to learn.

49
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:27,143
One of the interesting things I've heard
about these young kids who are selling 

50
00:02:30,271 --> 00:02:34,020
souvenirs is that they're not allowed to
go home to their house until they sell a

51
00:02:34,021 --> 00:02:36,960
certain amount of souvenirs.
They can't go home and have dinner until

52
00:02:36,961 --> 00:02:39,180
they sell 20 bracelets or something like
that.

53
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:43,410
So imagine that they have that positive 
incentive of making money,

54
00:02:43,411 --> 00:02:44,244
but they also have that negative 
incentive of being punished basically 

55
00:02:47,221 --> 00:02:50,490
for not selling enough.
So that really motivates them to just do

56
00:02:50,491 --> 00:02:52,260
whatever it takes.
Right.

57
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:56,070
So they have no excuses,
they make no excuses for themselves,

58
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:58,460
they just go out and do it because they 
have to.

59
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:01,120
They really have choice.
So they find whatever it takes,

60
00:03:01,121 --> 00:03:03,730
whatever resources they have inside 
themselves to learn.

61
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:04,893
Now that's quite different from your 
average western person who whines and 

62
00:03:08,291 --> 00:03:10,540
cries and says,
I can't learn languages.

63
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:12,490
It's too hard.
It takes too much time.

64
00:03:12,491 --> 00:03:15,820
I have to study.
I want to watch TV instead of these kids

65
00:03:15,821 --> 00:03:18,640
actually go out and just do it because 
they have no choice.

66
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:21,040
And if you decide to do that,
you can do that too.

67
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:22,810
So that's one thing we can learn from 
them.

68
00:03:23,130 --> 00:03:24,970
It's not only these better when kids 
either.

69
00:03:25,210 --> 00:03:27,460
I mean in other developing countries 
I've been to.

70
00:03:27,461 --> 00:03:29,590
I've noticed the same thing when I was 
in Cambodia,

71
00:03:29,591 --> 00:03:31,870
when I was in Indonesia when I was in 
Thailand.

72
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:34,540
People who just have that economic 
incentive,

73
00:03:34,570 --> 00:03:35,403
they don't have the same mental blocks 
toward learning languages that people 

74
00:03:38,081 --> 00:03:40,780
enrich countries do.
They just do whatever it takes.

75
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:43,780
They have that survival mentality and 
they just go for it.

76
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:44,913
The second thing is that they're skilled
are based in practical experience right 

77
00:03:47,861 --> 00:03:48,694
from the start.
They're not sitting at home or sitting 

78
00:03:50,651 --> 00:03:51,484
in a classroom getting kind of 
theoretical experience or simulated 

79
00:03:54,941 --> 00:03:55,600
experience.

80
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,433
They're out there getting real 
experience face to face with people 

81
00:03:58,780 --> 00:03:59,613
using the language right from the start.
Now that's different from the way most 

82
00:04:02,561 --> 00:04:03,394
of us learn.
We might learn from textbooks or in a 

83
00:04:04,781 --> 00:04:05,614
classroom.
We're learning theoretically in a 

84
00:04:07,031 --> 00:04:07,864
simulated sort of context and then later
when we have a certain level of the 

85
00:04:11,081 --> 00:04:11,914
language,
we go out and try to apply it with real 

86
00:04:13,331 --> 00:04:14,164
people.
That's kind of how most of us tend to 

87
00:04:15,671 --> 00:04:19,360
learn languages or typical people in the
western languages,

88
00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:20,283
but these kids,
they go out right from the start and 

89
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:24,340
they're getting that experience now.
Why is that good?

90
00:04:24,670 --> 00:04:25,503
If you're at home studying with a book 
or you're in a classroom listening to 

91
00:04:28,481 --> 00:04:30,080
your teacher and looking at the 
Whiteboard,

92
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:32,530
you're getting some sort of visual 
input.

93
00:04:32,531 --> 00:04:34,540
You're getting some auditory input to 
some extent.

94
00:04:34,541 --> 00:04:35,374
You're using those learning modalities,
but you're not really getting as much 

95
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,033
hands on kinesthetic experience of 
actually using the language and feeling 

96
00:04:41,981 --> 00:04:42,814
what it's like to use the language and 
when you get out there in the real 

97
00:04:45,611 --> 00:04:47,080
world,
in a real situation,

98
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:48,603
it's very visually stimulating because 
you're looking at an entire scene 

99
00:04:51,821 --> 00:04:52,450
surrounding you.

100
00:04:52,450 --> 00:04:54,370
You're seeing different things.
You're seeing,

101
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:57,760
you're hearing the real sounds of an 
interaction that you have the real world

102
00:04:57,761 --> 00:05:00,220
around you.
It's not a simulated experience like you

103
00:05:00,221 --> 00:05:03,190
get with your textbook at home or in a 
classroom.

104
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:04,233
You're out there in the real world and 
also you are getting the kinesthetic 

105
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:07,743
experience so you know what it feels 
like to use the language and you get a 

106
00:05:10,481 --> 00:05:15,370
certain emotional feeling when you 
interact with that person and you also,

107
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:16,263
you can feel physically what it's like 
to use your body language and to 

108
00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:21,730
actually physically interact with that 
person you're communicating with.

109
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:22,793
Now all of that creates a kind of a kind
of memory and experience that includes 

110
00:05:27,401 --> 00:05:28,234
all of those different learning 
modalities and it's much easier to 

111
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:36,010
remember than when you're learning just 
from a book or from the classroom.

112
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:40,390
I can remember experiences that I had 
using languages years and years ago.

113
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:45,640
I remember I have a memory of a 
situation 15 years ago in Jerusalem when

114
00:05:45,641 --> 00:05:48,160
I was there studying Hebrew and Hebrew 
course.

115
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:50,860
An acquaintance of mine came into the 
room and he said,

116
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:51,953
what most of the MTA when I was studying
and and that means you're not finished 

117
00:05:54,281 --> 00:05:55,630
yet.
And I said,

118
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:56,590
Lord,
mostly empty.

119
00:05:56,591 --> 00:05:57,620
And they buy.
That means,

120
00:05:57,740 --> 00:05:58,760
no,
I'm not finished yet.

121
00:05:58,850 --> 00:05:59,683
I'm in the middle of studying.
I remember that interaction and I 

122
00:06:02,481 --> 00:06:03,314
remember the whole scene.
I can see that room and I can see him 

123
00:06:05,931 --> 00:06:06,764
come into the room and I can hear the 
intonation in his voice and I remember 

124
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:12,380
kind of feeling taken aback by it.
The way he said it.

125
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:13,580
It sounded like,
what?

126
00:06:13,581 --> 00:06:15,230
You're an idiot.
You're not finished yet.

127
00:06:15,231 --> 00:06:16,064
It was that kind of intonation.
So I remember that whole feeling of the 

128
00:06:18,681 --> 00:06:21,290
experience.
Now that's the benefit of going out into

129
00:06:21,291 --> 00:06:23,450
the real world and really using the 
language.

130
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:26,870
You're encoding it into your physiology,
right?

131
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:30,560
It's a kinesthetic experience that you 
can recall as a memory.

132
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:33,290
The memories are more powerful than 
memorization.

133
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:35,210
That's how I like to think of it.
Now,

134
00:06:35,211 --> 00:06:36,044
the third thing that these girls do well
is that their use of the language is 

135
00:06:38,961 --> 00:06:39,794
very functional and it's goal oriented.
They're not just learning the language 

136
00:06:43,131 --> 00:06:45,890
for the sake of learning it.
They're not just learning it so they can

137
00:06:45,891 --> 00:06:46,581
say,
Hey,

138
00:06:46,581 --> 00:06:47,414
I'm fluent in 10 languages.
It's not an ego based approach to 

139
00:06:49,941 --> 00:06:50,774
learning.
They don't feel like they have to learn 

140
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:54,230
absolutely everything about the 
language.

141
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:56,540
What is their goal?
Their goal is to sell.

142
00:06:56,870 --> 00:06:57,703
That's their main function or main point
for using that language and that's what 

143
00:07:00,891 --> 00:07:01,724
they focus on when they're learning.
So basically they want to sell to you 

144
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:08,540
and they're following a straight line 
from meeting you to selling to you.

145
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:09,493
The line ends when you buy something,
all of the language they learn is 

146
00:07:12,111 --> 00:07:12,944
basically just language.
They need to follow that straight line 

147
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:16,153
and they can veer off the line a little 
bit and have a little bit of chatting 

148
00:07:18,801 --> 00:07:19,634
time with you and they can ask some 
questions about where you're from and 

149
00:07:22,611 --> 00:07:25,010
they can talk to you about some casual 
topics,

150
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:26,053
but when they get too far off of that 
line too far away from their focused 

151
00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:29,743
goal of selling to you,
then they probably aren't that good at 

152
00:07:31,941 --> 00:07:32,774
communicating because that's not the.
That's not where they focus their 

153
00:07:35,721 --> 00:07:36,554
studying and focus their attention.
So they'll always bring their attention 

154
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:41,930
back to that straight line of trying to 
sell to you.

155
00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:42,823
Right.
And all of their language is focused 

156
00:07:44,001 --> 00:07:44,834
around that.
So that's basically why they can speak 

157
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:47,593
10 different languages at such a young 
age because they're not learning 

158
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:52,700
absolutely everything about the 
language.

159
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:55,250
They're learning the grammar and the 
structure of the language basically.

160
00:07:55,251 --> 00:07:57,590
And they're learning the basic 
vocabulary of language.

161
00:07:57,591 --> 00:07:58,424
Everything they need to sell to you and 
to communicate with you and chat with 

162
00:08:01,251 --> 00:08:03,590
you and build rapport with you.
And that kind of thing,

163
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:04,693
but if you start talking about widely 
divergent subjects that have nothing to 

164
00:08:08,091 --> 00:08:08,924
do with the sale and nothing to do with 
getting to know you well enough to make 

165
00:08:12,141 --> 00:08:12,974
the sale happen,
then they're not going to be that good 

166
00:08:14,361 --> 00:08:15,194
with the language.
So basically they're very focused on 

167
00:08:16,970 --> 00:08:17,803
what they're using the language for and 
they have the basic structures of the 

168
00:08:20,301 --> 00:08:21,134
language in place.
So if in the future if they needed to 

169
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:24,044
learn it for a different function,
they can always add that extra 

170
00:08:25,851 --> 00:08:26,684
vocabulary,
add those extra structures that they 

171
00:08:28,281 --> 00:08:29,114
need on top of what they already know.
But they don't try to learn everything 

172
00:08:31,881 --> 00:08:32,240
at once.

173
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,980
They just learn what they need.
Right.

174
00:08:34,370 --> 00:08:35,203
So in terms of your study,
think about what you need to use the 

175
00:08:38,181 --> 00:08:39,014
language for.
You really need to learn absolutely 

176
00:08:41,631 --> 00:08:42,464
everything about the language or do you 
just want to use it for a specific 

177
00:08:44,961 --> 00:08:46,880
purpose?
Like getting to know friends,

178
00:08:46,881 --> 00:08:49,580
like making some friends,
being social in that language.

179
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:52,250
Do you need to use it for a specific 
business purpose?

180
00:08:52,251 --> 00:08:53,990
Do you need to write emails in that 
language?

181
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,033
Whatever your purpose is,
maybe you should focus on that rather 

182
00:08:57,331 --> 00:09:00,540
than trying to tackle the entire 
language in one big goal.

183
00:09:01,050 --> 00:09:01,883
Now it's also worth pointing out that 
these kids don't really worry about 

184
00:09:04,771 --> 00:09:05,604
perfection at all.
A lot of them speak with kind of funny 

185
00:09:08,011 --> 00:09:10,140
grammar.
They don't speak accurately,

186
00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:12,330
but they communicate.
They understand you,

187
00:09:12,331 --> 00:09:14,550
you understand them,
so it's all good.

188
00:09:14,551 --> 00:09:16,980
They can achieve that goal that they 
have for the language.

189
00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:18,203
Now,
the benefit that has for learning is 

190
00:09:19,201 --> 00:09:20,034
that you don't slow yourself down.
You don't put yourself into a bit of a 

191
00:09:22,771 --> 00:09:25,920
panic worrying about all the details and
worrying about perfection.

192
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:30,660
Being a perfectionist can puts you in 
into a non ideal learning state.

193
00:09:30,930 --> 00:09:32,820
It can make you stressed,
right?

194
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:35,550
Anxiety and stresses the antithesis of 
learning.

195
00:09:35,551 --> 00:09:38,070
You want to avoid it like the plague,
always relaxed.

196
00:09:38,190 --> 00:09:39,023
You can continue improving your accuracy
and continue to self monitor and fix 

197
00:09:42,931 --> 00:09:46,200
your your mistakes and all that,
but don't worry about it.

198
00:09:46,201 --> 00:09:47,034
Just keep on learning and keep your goal
in your functions for the language in 

199
00:09:50,311 --> 00:09:51,144
mind,
just like these girls do and you'll 

200
00:09:52,201 --> 00:09:55,260
learn a lot better.
So what can we learn from the eight year

201
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:56,670
old Bedouin kid?
Well,

202
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:59,850
number one is no whining,
no excuses,

203
00:09:59,851 --> 00:10:03,270
just go for it.
Find what motivates you and do it.

204
00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:07,380
Number two is get real experience from 
as early on as possible.

205
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:10,430
Don't do all your studying and simulated
experiences,

206
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:14,010
simulated situations.
Don't do all your studying with books.

207
00:10:14,011 --> 00:10:16,890
Get real experience with real people as 
early as you can.

208
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:17,813
And the third thing is,
know your main purpose for learning the 

209
00:10:19,861 --> 00:10:20,694
language.
Do you really need to know absolutely 

210
00:10:22,231 --> 00:10:23,064
everything about the language?
Do you just want to make friends in the 

211
00:10:25,531 --> 00:10:26,364
language?
Do you want to use it for a specific 

212
00:10:27,331 --> 00:10:28,164
purpose?
Focus on your purpose for that language 

213
00:10:29,970 --> 00:10:32,400
and put your attention there.
Then later in the future,

214
00:10:32,401 --> 00:10:36,360
if you need to add extra functions and 
extra purposes for the language you can,

215
00:10:36,530 --> 00:10:37,363
but focus on what you need it for and 
that will really accelerate your 

216
00:10:39,931 --> 00:10:40,764
learning because you're not paying 
attention to things you don't really 

217
00:10:42,721 --> 00:10:43,554
need to do.
So if you ever think that you can't do 

218
00:10:45,781 --> 00:10:46,614
it,
that you can't learn a language that 

219
00:10:47,311 --> 00:10:49,650
you're not good with languages or 
whatever.

220
00:10:49,830 --> 00:10:53,410
Just remember all those kids in 
developing countries who learn languages

221
00:10:53,430 --> 00:10:54,263
quite well because they,
they just go for it and they have no 

222
00:10:56,911 --> 00:10:59,670
mental block to learning it,
so if they can do it,

223
00:10:59,730 --> 00:11:02,550
you can do it.
Don't even stress just to go for it.

224
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:03,541
Alright,
this is Paul.

225
00:11:03,541 --> 00:11:06,210
Thank you for watching.
Have a good night and see ya.

226
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:10,510
Hello everyone.
Thank you for tuning into laying focused

227
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:12,130
TV.
I am your host Paul,

228
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:13,113
and tonight we're going to talk about 
the difference between informal and 

229
00:11:15,701 --> 00:11:19,660
formal language and which one you should
focus on learning when you're learning a

230
00:11:19,661 --> 00:11:20,494
new language.
Another awesome benefit of meditation 

231
00:11:22,571 --> 00:11:26,560
for language learning is that it helps 
you with your listening comprehension.

232
00:11:26,950 --> 00:11:27,783
So when you're listening,
often there's something that's blocking 

233
00:11:30,221 --> 00:11:33,580
you are getting in your way.
Now what I mean is this.
