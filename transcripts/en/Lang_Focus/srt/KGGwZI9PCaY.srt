00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:03,000
Hello everyone.
Thank you for tuning into the lane focus

2
00:00:03,001 --> 00:00:04,290
channel.
My name is Paul.

3
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:08,370
Today we're going to talk about a common
question related to language learning.

4
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:09,383
Can adults learn a second language the 
same way that they learned their native 

5
00:00:12,481 --> 00:00:16,590
language as a kid in a lot of the 
marketing surrounding different language

6
00:00:16,591 --> 00:00:18,960
programs and the courses that you can 
buy,

7
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:23,100
you'll often see that you'll see them 
justify their methodology by saying this

8
00:00:23,101 --> 00:00:26,100
is the way you learned as a kid or when 
you were a kid,

9
00:00:26,101 --> 00:00:26,934
you didn't need written materials,
you just listened and all that kind of 

10
00:00:29,161 --> 00:00:31,020
thing,
so I wanted to talk about that.

11
00:00:31,021 --> 00:00:31,854
Is it,
is it actually possible and is it 

12
00:00:33,541 --> 00:00:36,300
practical to learn that way when you're 
an adult?

13
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:38,760
So let's get into it.
First of all,

14
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:41,820
adults learn differently from infants 
and toddlers.

15
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:45,900
It's been proven through studies that 
there is definitely a critical age range

16
00:00:45,901 --> 00:00:49,890
after which it becomes more difficult to
learn a language.

17
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:50,963
When you are an infant,
you are using both hemispheres of your 

18
00:00:53,581 --> 00:00:56,010
brain for language learning and that 
process,

19
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:56,933
that way of learning usually lasts until
you're about two years old and then it 

20
00:00:59,881 --> 00:01:00,714
starts to change.
It starts to become localized in your 

21
00:01:02,971 --> 00:01:06,270
left brain and your right brain starts 
to be deemphasized.

22
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:08,250
Now it doesn't happen immediately right 
away,

23
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:12,750
but that process continues from about 
age two until you reach puberty,

24
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:16,230
so around the time of puberty,
so after you reach puberty,

25
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:20,190
your language learning processes.
Now a very left brain process,

26
00:01:20,191 --> 00:01:24,570
it's much more of an intentional.
It's much more of an intentional kind of

27
00:01:24,571 --> 00:01:25,404
study rather than just an intuitive 
absorption of information from your 

28
00:01:28,741 --> 00:01:31,440
environment.
So it definitely does become different.

29
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:33,840
Let me play devil's advocate for a 
minute.

30
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:34,733
Let's just hypothetically say that yes,
we can learn the same way that we 

31
00:01:38,191 --> 00:01:39,240
learned as infants.

32
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:41,520
Is that practical?
Should we learn that way?

33
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:42,743
I would say that it's really impractical
for an adult to learn their second 

34
00:01:45,721 --> 00:01:48,990
language the same way they learn their 
native language because adults just have

35
00:01:48,991 --> 00:01:52,170
a very different lifestyle than little 
kids or infants do.

36
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:53,333
When you're an infant,
you spend about a year just sitting 

37
00:01:55,561 --> 00:01:58,680
there listening to the language before 
you actually say anything,

38
00:01:58,681 --> 00:01:59,514
just absorbing the sounds.
You're internalizing the phonology 

39
00:02:01,831 --> 00:02:04,320
before you actually produce it.
As an adult,

40
00:02:04,321 --> 00:02:06,180
do you have a year to sit around doing 
that?

41
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:08,310
I know I don't.
I have too many things.

42
00:02:08,311 --> 00:02:09,144
I want to study too many things I want 
to do and experience to many other 

43
00:02:11,641 --> 00:02:13,950
languages I want to get to in the 
future.

44
00:02:14,130 --> 00:02:15,840
I don't have a year to just sit and 
listen,

45
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:16,763
so unless you were an infant or maybe 
unless you're retired or unemployed and 

46
00:02:19,981 --> 00:02:20,814
have nothing to do,
then I guess a year of just sitting and 

47
00:02:22,771 --> 00:02:24,840
listening is probably a waste of your 
time.

48
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,010
Am I right about that?
Now,

49
00:02:26,011 --> 00:02:26,844
also related to time is this kid spent 
so much time in an immersive 

50
00:02:30,301 --> 00:02:31,770
environment,
10,

51
00:02:31,771 --> 00:02:33,930
12 hours a day,
their whole waking life.

52
00:02:33,931 --> 00:02:37,530
They are surrounded by that language.
When their kids at school,

53
00:02:37,531 --> 00:02:38,790
at home,
in their environment,

54
00:02:38,791 --> 00:02:41,190
on tv,
everything is in that language.

55
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:44,880
Now you probably have a job that's in 
your native language.

56
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:48,960
You probably have a circle of friends 
that speak your native language and your

57
00:02:48,961 --> 00:02:51,150
family probably speaks your native 
language,

58
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:52,223
so do you really have 10 to 12 hours a 
day to be immersed in your second 

59
00:02:55,831 --> 00:02:59,010
language and even if you are in that 
country,

60
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:01,690
even if you moved to a country where 
that language is spoken,

61
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:02,763
do you really have a circle of native 
speakers who are talking to you all the 

62
00:03:05,921 --> 00:03:06,754
time,
the same way that adults talk to babies 

63
00:03:08,201 --> 00:03:09,490
or toddlers all the time.

64
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:11,710
When you're a toddler,
people are trying to talk to you,

65
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:13,390
right?
They're trying to encourage you to speak

66
00:03:13,391 --> 00:03:15,790
and they're trying to help raise you by 
speaking to you,

67
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:16,863
but when you're an adult,
most people just don't really care that 

68
00:03:19,121 --> 00:03:21,070
much.
If you are going to learn their language

69
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:21,963
to support you,
but they're not going to sit there 

70
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:24,453
intentionally talking to you all the 
time just to give you an opportunity to 

71
00:03:27,071 --> 00:03:27,904
practice.
So you probably have like one hour a 

72
00:03:29,831 --> 00:03:30,910
day,
two hours a day,

73
00:03:30,911 --> 00:03:33,580
three hours a day.
Whatever it is that you have to focus on

74
00:03:33,581 --> 00:03:36,430
that language,
but you can't be immersed in it all day,

75
00:03:36,431 --> 00:03:38,830
every day,
the same way that a child can,

76
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:39,693
so that means that you have to 
strategize and use that time available 

77
00:03:41,861 --> 00:03:42,694
to you in the best way that you can.
So as adults we try to look for ways to 

78
00:03:46,031 --> 00:03:49,870
accelerate our learning and one of the 
ways we do that is by cutting out things

79
00:03:49,871 --> 00:03:52,480
that we really don't need to learn right
now.

80
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:53,413
So tell me this.
When you learn a second language as an 

81
00:03:54,821 --> 00:03:57,970
adult,
do you really care how to say ladybug or

82
00:03:57,971 --> 00:03:58,804
how to say Choo Choo train,
or do you care what the sound is that a 

83
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:03,310
bunny rabbit makes like boing,
boing,

84
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:04,510
boing,
whatever it is,

85
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:08,980
do you care about all the Onomatopoeia 
that appear in comic books like Bam,

86
00:04:09,010 --> 00:04:09,910
boom,
smash,

87
00:04:09,911 --> 00:04:11,260
sap,
Pow Kaboom,

88
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:12,430
Kapow,
splat?

89
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:13,383
Do you care about all those sounds?
Do you really need to learn those words 

90
00:04:15,671 --> 00:04:17,410
in that language?
Probably not.

91
00:04:17,710 --> 00:04:18,543
When you're an adult,
you need to cut out the things that are 

92
00:04:20,261 --> 00:04:21,094
not necessary and focus on what's most 
relevant to your adult life and it's 

93
00:04:24,611 --> 00:04:28,300
probably not things that are relevant to
kids a lot of the time now,

94
00:04:28,301 --> 00:04:30,610
this is partly a matter of efficient use
of time,

95
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:31,773
but it's also a matter of what kind of 
language is appropriate to use as an 

96
00:04:35,081 --> 00:04:35,830
adult.

97
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:36,663
Now kids speak like kids and they 
usually speak that way for years and 

98
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:40,893
years and years until they become more 
influenced by the literary language and 

99
00:04:43,961 --> 00:04:47,020
they start to speak more like adults who
can be taken seriously,

100
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:51,250
but you as an adult probably want to be 
taken seriously fairly early on,

101
00:04:51,251 --> 00:04:54,070
especially if you're using the language 
for work or for business.

102
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:54,933
So you don't have 15 years to spend on 
speaking like a kid before you learn to 

103
00:04:59,711 --> 00:05:01,360
speak more like an adult.
Right?

104
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,313
Yeah.
So like I looked at the earnings report 

105
00:05:03,581 --> 00:05:05,050
and stuff and it was really cool and 
stuff,

106
00:05:05,051 --> 00:05:07,450
but my boss was like,
that's really dumb.

107
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:08,493
As adults,
we're at some disadvantages when it 

108
00:05:09,641 --> 00:05:13,690
comes to learning a second language,
but we also have some advantages and one

109
00:05:13,691 --> 00:05:14,524
of them is our ability to analyze what 
our learning needs are and to focus our 

110
00:05:18,281 --> 00:05:21,670
attention on meeting those needs so you 
can look at your goals for the language,

111
00:05:21,671 --> 00:05:23,740
what situations you will use the 
language in,

112
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:27,310
and then focus on what you need in order
to achieve those goals,

113
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:28,510
so that's your advantage.

114
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:29,463
You should use that advantage.
You don't have to spend years and years 

115
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:34,810
building a base the way kids do in order
to achieve your goals.

116
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:36,303
Another thing that makes learning as an 
adult difference is that your self 

117
00:05:39,221 --> 00:05:42,070
concept affects the way you learn.
When you're a little kid,

118
00:05:42,071 --> 00:05:44,320
you are carefree.
You don't worry about anything.

119
00:05:44,321 --> 00:05:45,154
You don't really have an ego yet.
You don't think about your relation to 

120
00:05:48,401 --> 00:05:52,330
the world and what's allowed and what's 
not allowed and things you can do,

121
00:05:52,331 --> 00:05:54,670
things you can't do.
You don't really have that concept yet.

122
00:05:54,671 --> 00:05:59,300
You just do whatever the heck you want 
and as an adult you can't be like that.

123
00:05:59,301 --> 00:06:00,134
You have all of these layers of self 
concept that have developed throughout 

124
00:06:03,801 --> 00:06:05,210
the years.
You've developed an ego,

125
00:06:05,211 --> 00:06:06,044
you've developed a sense of your 
relation to other people into the world 

126
00:06:09,411 --> 00:06:11,870
and you think,
I can do these things.

127
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:14,060
I can't do these things if I do this 
thing,

128
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:16,820
people will react a certain way.
If I do this thing,

129
00:06:16,821 --> 00:06:17,654
people will react differently,
so that causes a lot of mental blocks 

130
00:06:21,051 --> 00:06:21,884
towards learning,
especially when it comes to languages 

131
00:06:23,811 --> 00:06:24,644
for some reason.
If you think that you're not that smart 

132
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:27,823
or if you think that you're not that 
socially savvy so you can't communicate 

133
00:06:30,801 --> 00:06:31,634
with people,
you might self sabotage when practicing 

134
00:06:34,521 --> 00:06:36,440
or learning a language,
that kind of thing,

135
00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:37,483
or you might self sabotage because you 
think that it doesn't match your 

136
00:06:41,931 --> 00:06:44,720
environment.
Like if your friends are all into sports

137
00:06:44,721 --> 00:06:47,720
and they're all into music and you're 
into studying a language,

138
00:06:47,721 --> 00:06:49,940
maybe you'll be a nerd or maybe you'll 
be different than them.

139
00:06:49,941 --> 00:06:50,774
That kind of thing.
You start to be conscious of that sort 

140
00:06:52,101 --> 00:06:52,934
of thing.
As an adult or as little kids aren't 

141
00:06:54,771 --> 00:06:55,490
conscious of that.

142
00:06:55,490 --> 00:06:58,190
They don't give a shit.
They just do whatever they want and it's

143
00:06:58,250 --> 00:06:59,083
all about them.
So in order to learn the way a kid 

144
00:07:01,581 --> 00:07:02,414
learns,
you kind of have to get back into that 

145
00:07:03,921 --> 00:07:04,754
childlike headspace and forget about the
world and just focus on yourself and 

146
00:07:08,661 --> 00:07:10,790
it's hard for adults to do that.
I mean in some ways,

147
00:07:10,791 --> 00:07:13,400
maybe we can learn from the way kids 
learn,

148
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:16,400
but at the same time it's quite 
difficult.

149
00:07:16,401 --> 00:07:17,234
That doesn't really fit into the way we 
live and you would have to remove a lot 

150
00:07:19,701 --> 00:07:20,534
of layers of your self concept in order 
to do that and that would take some 

151
00:07:23,631 --> 00:07:24,464
effort.
That's kind of a separate mission from 

152
00:07:25,731 --> 00:07:26,900
here.
A language learning mission,

153
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:27,913
so it's much more practical in the short
term as adults to set up a very 

154
00:07:31,851 --> 00:07:32,684
intentional program of learning that can
motivate you through some of those 

155
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,393
things that discourage you and actually 
push you forward so that we can do that 

156
00:07:40,461 --> 00:07:41,294
through setting up a learning program 
and thinking about our goals and 

157
00:07:44,091 --> 00:07:46,420
visualizing our goals and that kind of 
thing to.

158
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:50,210
Because we're going to have those blocks
and we're going to have those times when

159
00:07:50,211 --> 00:07:52,460
we hesitate.
Because of that self concept,

160
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:54,830
as adults,
we can get through that as kids.

161
00:07:54,831 --> 00:07:55,664
You don't need to,
so we don't really need those 

162
00:07:57,561 --> 00:08:00,200
strategies.
So I think that's another big difference

163
00:08:00,201 --> 00:08:02,540
between adult learners and child 
learners,

164
00:08:02,570 --> 00:08:04,670
especially when it comes to languages 
for sure.

165
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:08,360
So the hype that you can learn a second 
language,

166
00:08:08,370 --> 00:08:12,140
the way that babies learn their native 
language is exactly just that hype.

167
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,393
Do you think babies learn their native 
language by listening to eight hours of 

168
00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:18,500
audio on a language CD?
Of course not.

169
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:20,870
So take it for what it is.
It's marketing hype.

170
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:21,943
You can see through.
It doesn't mean they're bad learning 

171
00:08:23,481 --> 00:08:24,314
materials,
but just don't buy into the marketing 

172
00:08:26,061 --> 00:08:26,990
hype.
Right.

173
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:28,490
This is Lang.
Focus on Paul.

174
00:08:28,491 --> 00:08:30,320
Thank you for watching.
Have a good day.

175
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:34,220
Bye now.
This goes back to my first time visiting

176
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:38,360
Egypt in 1997.
I was in a backpack of resort called the

177
00:08:38,361 --> 00:08:43,361
hub and I met a number of girls who were
there selling bracelets.

178
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:46,460
They were selling little trinkets,
souvenirs to tourists,

179
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:48,890
like me,
inner dialogue inside our head.

180
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:49,903
It's kind of a voice that's constantly 
narrating our lives and commenting on 

181
00:08:53,361 --> 00:08:54,440
what's happening around us.
