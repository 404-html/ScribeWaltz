00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:03,150
Hello everyone.
Welcome to the Lange focus channel.

2
00:00:03,151 --> 00:00:03,984
My name is Paul.
Today we are going to talk about 

3
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:10,500
language learning edge number four and 
that is focus.

4
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:11,543
Focus comes first.
A lot of people who really get into 

5
00:00:13,981 --> 00:00:16,500
learning languages as a passion and as a
hobby,

6
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:21,240
they have a certain weakness and that 
weakness is that they are visionary,

7
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:22,223
they are too visionary,
they have too many new ideas all the 

8
00:00:24,931 --> 00:00:25,764
time,
too many things that they want to try 

9
00:00:27,421 --> 00:00:30,570
too many things that they want to do.
Too many things that they want to create

10
00:00:30,571 --> 00:00:33,150
sometimes.
Now in some ways that's awesome.

11
00:00:33,151 --> 00:00:33,984
That's very good for being creative and 
for getting new ideas and setting new 

12
00:00:36,751 --> 00:00:39,900
goals,
but it can also be a distraction because

13
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:43,410
it's difficult to focus on one thing for
a long enough to achieve it.

14
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,780
Right?
Maybe you start to learn French,

15
00:00:45,781 --> 00:00:46,614
but then you read a little bit about the
other romance languages and you want to 

16
00:00:49,261 --> 00:00:51,360
start studying Italian or Spanish or 
something.

17
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:53,310
Maybe you're learning Arabic and then 
you think,

18
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:54,173
hmm,
it would be interesting to learn Hebrew 

19
00:00:55,141 --> 00:00:55,974
too and see how they're related.
So it's very easy to get sidetracked 

20
00:00:59,101 --> 00:01:02,940
from the language that you want to be 
focusing on at the moment.

21
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:04,073
If you really think about it,
who gets good at new skills the most 

22
00:01:06,841 --> 00:01:07,674
quickly?
It's probably people who get really 

23
00:01:09,121 --> 00:01:09,954
obsessed with that skill are really 
obsessed with learning and practicing 

24
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:13,433
around that topic and that's because 
they're dedicating so much of their 

25
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:19,470
mental resources to that skill or to 
that topic.

26
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:20,573
You might think that if you study French
for one hour that that's the same as 

27
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:27,120
studying French for one hour plus 
Spanish for one hour.

28
00:01:27,121 --> 00:01:30,300
Like you will be learning the same 
amount of French in both scenarios.

29
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:31,223
But I would say that that's not true and
that's because a lot of the learning 

30
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:36,450
takes place when you're not studying.

31
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:37,283
It takes place in the background.
Subconsciously you're processing and 

32
00:01:40,141 --> 00:01:40,974
you're synthesizing all the things 
you've studied in the background while 

33
00:01:43,081 --> 00:01:45,180
you're going about your day and doing 
other things.

34
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:48,390
Sometimes if you are in tune with that 
kind of inner voice,

35
00:01:48,391 --> 00:01:50,370
you can notice that you'll notice in the
background,

36
00:01:50,371 --> 00:01:51,204
your mind is making sentences in the 
language while you're driving or while 

37
00:01:53,881 --> 00:01:56,400
you're on the train or while you're 
talking to someone you can,

38
00:01:56,610 --> 00:01:57,443
you can be aware of some of that 
processing going on so that learning is 

39
00:02:01,021 --> 00:02:05,280
taking place when you're not studying,
but if you are focusing on two different

40
00:02:05,281 --> 00:02:06,114
languages,
if you're studying Spanish for one hour 

41
00:02:07,501 --> 00:02:09,750
a day and you're studying French for one
hour a day,

42
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:10,793
then that subconscious background 
processes being divided between two 

43
00:02:13,951 --> 00:02:14,784
different languages so you're not 
getting as much of that growth going on 

44
00:02:17,761 --> 00:02:18,594
in the background.
Even if you dedicate the same amount of 

45
00:02:20,551 --> 00:02:22,350
study times to that language.

46
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:26,490
So the most efficient way to learn one 
language really well is to focus on that

47
00:02:26,491 --> 00:02:28,950
language and that language alone.
Now,

48
00:02:28,951 --> 00:02:31,860
how do you do that if you're one of 
those visionary people who get all those

49
00:02:31,861 --> 00:02:32,694
ideas,
how do you kind of manage all the ideas 

50
00:02:34,831 --> 00:02:35,664
and all the goals that you have where 
you have to kind of get used to pushing 

51
00:02:38,491 --> 00:02:41,370
certain goals?
Often to the distance into the future,

52
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:44,850
I wouldn't think of pushing them aside 
or putting them behind you.

53
00:02:44,851 --> 00:02:46,890
I would think of putting them off into 
the future.

54
00:02:46,891 --> 00:02:50,070
So after you finish achieving this 
current goal right now,

55
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:50,933
for example,
getting really good at French in the 

56
00:02:52,951 --> 00:02:54,150
future.
Beyond that,

57
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:56,100
you can see the next goal in front of 
you,

58
00:02:56,101 --> 00:02:59,950
which is to start learning Spanish or 
whatever your language of interest.

59
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:02,260
Yes.
But just think of it like that.

60
00:03:02,261 --> 00:03:06,250
Like you're not discarding those goals 
are discarding those missions you were,

61
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:09,730
you were kind of putting them off into 
the future and you'll get to them later.

62
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:10,773
But your primary mission right now is 
this one which you need to accomplish 

63
00:03:13,511 --> 00:03:16,000
first before you can get to that future 
mission.

64
00:03:16,210 --> 00:03:18,490
So I've been talking about focus in the 
grand sense,

65
00:03:18,491 --> 00:03:21,280
like in terms of your large goals and 
that kind of thing.

66
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,233
But of course focus is also important in
the moment because we live in such a 

67
00:03:25,421 --> 00:03:26,254
distraction,
prawn world with the Internet and with 

68
00:03:28,121 --> 00:03:30,490
smartphones and with email and all those
things,

69
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:31,503
there's just,
there's so much distraction all around 

70
00:03:33,161 --> 00:03:36,610
you all the time that it's difficult to 
focus on the task at hand.

71
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:41,320
Even if you have put all of your 
secondary goal is often to the future,

72
00:03:41,321 --> 00:03:42,154
just focusing on your primary goal.
It can be tough just on a day by day 

73
00:03:45,101 --> 00:03:47,320
basis.
We all have our different weaknesses.

74
00:03:47,321 --> 00:03:48,154
Some people get caught up in facebook,
some people like me get caught up in 

75
00:03:51,401 --> 00:03:52,234
youtube,
like I get caught up in all of the 

76
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:55,000
videos in the sidebar.

77
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:55,833
I'll end up watching 20 videos when I 
planned to just watch one and that kind 

78
00:03:58,631 --> 00:04:01,300
of thing.
So it's really easy to get off track and

79
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:03,880
lose focus of what your goal is for that
day.

80
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:06,550
So it's important to not leave it to 
willpower.

81
00:04:06,551 --> 00:04:07,384
It's important to have some strategies 
in place and make some decisions that 

82
00:04:09,731 --> 00:04:12,730
will help guide your behavior when 
you're trying to get something done.

83
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:13,863
Avoiding distractions and staying 
focused is a little different for 

84
00:04:15,821 --> 00:04:16,654
everyone.
But I'll give you a couple of things 

85
00:04:17,831 --> 00:04:19,930
that I used to deal with these 
situations.

86
00:04:20,050 --> 00:04:23,080
Maybe you have some other ideas that you
can share in the comments.

87
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:24,123
One of my strategies for avoiding 
distractions is that I have a kind of 

88
00:04:26,831 --> 00:04:27,664
transition activity.
It's a one kind of study or one kind of 

89
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:35,080
study method that I find enjoyable 
that's really easy for me to get started

90
00:04:35,081 --> 00:04:38,500
at that I don't hesitate or 
procrastinate when starting,

91
00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:41,500
and that's kind of my stepping stone 
into studying.

92
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:45,610
So for me that is listening passively to
the news in my target language.

93
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:47,290
I really enjoy that.
It's relaxing,

94
00:04:47,291 --> 00:04:48,124
it's kind of meditative.
I can just sit there and just commonly 

95
00:04:50,111 --> 00:04:54,710
listen and that's an easy way for me to 
get into that language is mode.

96
00:04:54,730 --> 00:04:56,980
So if I'm listening to French on the 
news,

97
00:04:57,070 --> 00:04:59,770
I can sit there and relax,
but then I start to notice words.

98
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:00,311
I'm like,
Hey,

99
00:05:00,311 --> 00:05:01,144
what does that word mean?
And I'll pick up my dictionary and look 

100
00:05:02,801 --> 00:05:03,634
it up and I'll start to get curious.
I'll start to get into French study 

101
00:05:06,251 --> 00:05:08,770
mode.
And then after that I'm going to pick up

102
00:05:08,771 --> 00:05:12,130
my books and I'm going to start studying
and then that kind of thing will happen.

103
00:05:12,131 --> 00:05:12,964
I'll transition into studying French 
through that easy activity that I enjoy 

104
00:05:16,541 --> 00:05:19,780
doing and that's kind of a low 
investment activity for me.

105
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:21,660
So maybe that's something you can try 
it.

106
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:24,610
If you really like listening to songs in
your target language,

107
00:05:24,611 --> 00:05:25,444
that can be your transition into 
studying or if you really just like 

108
00:05:29,021 --> 00:05:29,854
talking to people,
maybe you can go on facebook and chat 

109
00:05:31,451 --> 00:05:33,010
with some native speakers in that 
language,

110
00:05:33,011 --> 00:05:36,070
leave some comments in that language,
just getting that interaction,

111
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:37,083
but whatever it is for you,
that's kind of low commitment and easy 

112
00:05:39,341 --> 00:05:42,520
to get started with,
but is in your target language.

113
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:45,160
That's a good way to transition into 
studying.

114
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:49,060
Another important thing is to actually 
physically block out distractions.

115
00:05:49,061 --> 00:05:51,540
Like sometimes I pick up my phone,
my smartphone,

116
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:55,300
and I put it in the other room so that 
it won't be distracting to me.

117
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:59,030
I always have the ringer turned off and 
when I'm focusing on studying,

118
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:02,360
I'll turn off all of the notifications 
like no facebook notifications,

119
00:06:02,361 --> 00:06:05,300
no line APP notifications,
nothing like that.

120
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:06,793
But sometimes I'll still be interested 
in picking up my phone in and checking 

121
00:06:09,831 --> 00:06:10,664
something,
but if I want to avoid that I'll just 

122
00:06:11,691 --> 00:06:13,250
pick it up and put it in the other room.

123
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:16,340
So it's kind of a hassle to get up and 
go do that.

124
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:17,263
The benefit of actually picking up the 
phone is not as big as the hassle of 

125
00:06:20,331 --> 00:06:21,164
going to get it,
so it's good to sometimes just remove 

126
00:06:23,241 --> 00:06:25,100
those distractions from your 
environment.

127
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:26,023
Another thing that I don't really do but
some of my friends do is to use a kind 

128
00:06:28,281 --> 00:06:29,114
of software or application that blocks 
websites that you find particularly 

129
00:06:32,511 --> 00:06:34,190
distracting.
Like there's one,

130
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:37,370
uh,
this one software called cold Turkey and

131
00:06:37,371 --> 00:06:40,280
there's another one that is called stay 
focused.

132
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:43,610
That's a chrome add on that you can use 
to block certain websites.

133
00:06:43,611 --> 00:06:44,444
Like,
let's say you get caught up in facebook 

134
00:06:45,411 --> 00:06:46,244
all the time,
or you visit tech crunch blog all the 

135
00:06:48,201 --> 00:06:49,034
time,
but you want to just stay away from 

136
00:06:50,031 --> 00:06:52,400
those for a while.
You can put those in your block list.

137
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:54,420
So then whenever you turn on that 
software,

138
00:06:54,421 --> 00:06:55,730
it'll block those websites.

139
00:06:55,910 --> 00:06:59,450
And I think you can specify a certain 
period of time as well so that you can't

140
00:06:59,451 --> 00:07:00,284
just go in and change the settings 
whenever you want and will actually 

141
00:07:02,031 --> 00:07:03,160
block you,
um,

142
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:04,213
based on the time you decide in advance.
So you can kind of change your mind in 

143
00:07:07,161 --> 00:07:07,994
the middle.
You've already fixed the blockage of 

144
00:07:09,711 --> 00:07:10,544
those websites.
So that's another thing you can try if 

145
00:07:12,111 --> 00:07:14,390
you're distracted by any specific 
websites.

146
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:18,950
Another thing that I do to stay focused 
is I listened to binaural beats track on

147
00:07:18,951 --> 00:07:19,784
Youtube.
I just search for binaural beats 

148
00:07:20,991 --> 00:07:23,630
concentration and one of those videos 
will come up.

149
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:26,090
I have a specific one that I liked that 
I always listened to.

150
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,193
So you can try a few of them to see 
which one helps you focus and just put 

151
00:07:30,321 --> 00:07:32,060
on your headphones and while you're 
studying,

152
00:07:32,061 --> 00:07:33,120
use that.
Uh,

153
00:07:33,530 --> 00:07:36,230
you can do it when you're just studying 
with your textbook,

154
00:07:36,231 --> 00:07:38,180
but also if you're using audio 
materials,

155
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:39,770
you can play both at the same time.

156
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:42,200
If it's on your computer,
you can play that youtube track,

157
00:07:42,201 --> 00:07:46,370
but you can also use your cds and just 
have them playing over top of each other

158
00:07:46,371 --> 00:07:47,204
and it's fine.
You can turn down the binaural beats a 

159
00:07:48,441 --> 00:07:51,230
little bit and just listen to the audio 
track mainly.

160
00:07:51,231 --> 00:07:54,440
But the binaural beats be there in the 
background kind of helping you focus.

161
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:56,600
Some people say that binaural beats 
don't work.

162
00:07:56,601 --> 00:07:58,670
There's no scientific basis.
Well,

163
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:00,950
if it helps you focus,
then it works.

164
00:08:00,951 --> 00:08:03,500
So it doesn't really matter if it's 
scientifically proven or not.

165
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:04,820
Try it,
see if it helps you.

166
00:08:05,290 --> 00:08:06,123
All right,
so those are some of my ideas on how to 

167
00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:09,920
stay focused.
Focus comes first.

168
00:08:09,921 --> 00:08:13,220
It's important for learning the language
that you really want to get good at.

169
00:08:13,370 --> 00:08:15,470
All right.
This is Paul and this is Lang Focus.

170
00:08:15,471 --> 00:08:17,450
Thank you for tuning in.
Have a good day.

171
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:20,663
When you were an infant,
you spend about a year just sitting 

172
00:08:22,861 --> 00:08:25,980
there and listening to the language 
before you actually say anything,

173
00:08:25,981 --> 00:08:26,814
just absorbing the sounds.
You were internalizing the phonology 

174
00:08:29,131 --> 00:08:31,620
before you actually produce it as an 
adult.

175
00:08:31,621 --> 00:08:33,510
Do you have a year to sit around doing 
that?

176
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:34,553
I know I don't.
I've met a lot of people who are great 

177
00:08:37,441 --> 00:08:40,710
with languages while traveling and also 
in my regular life,

178
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:41,873
and I'd like to talk about a couple of 
particularly impressive people that we 

179
00:08:44,641 --> 00:08:45,840
can learn something from.
