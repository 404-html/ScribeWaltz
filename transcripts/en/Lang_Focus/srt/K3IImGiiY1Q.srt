00:00:01,310 --> 00:00:02,143
Hi there.

2
00:00:02,390 --> 00:00:03,223
Licensee,
Deutsche,

3
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:04,630
Deutsche.
No,

4
00:00:04,631 --> 00:00:05,920
sorry,
I don't speak Dutch.

5
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:11,150
Hello language,
enthusiastic.

6
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:14,090
Welcome to the Lange Focus Channel and 
my name is Paul.

7
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:17,270
Today I'm going to talk about the German
language.

8
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:21,410
German is a very important language that
deserves all of our attention.

9
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:26,090
It is spoken by $95 million native 
speakers mainly in central Europe,

10
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:30,680
but it's also spoken by an additional 10
to $15 million second language speakers,

11
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:31,753
especially in eastern Europe.
It is the majority language and an 

12
00:00:34,641 --> 00:00:37,610
official language in Germany of course,
but also Austria,

13
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:40,520
Switzerland,
Liechtenstein and the south tyrol region

14
00:00:40,521 --> 00:00:41,354
of northern Italy.
It's also an official language in 

15
00:00:43,131 --> 00:00:46,160
Luxembourg and Belgium,
but it's not a majority language there.

16
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:49,910
German is the most widely spoken 
language in the European Union.

17
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:50,893
It is also one of the most widely taught
languages in the world with between 75 

18
00:00:54,681 --> 00:00:55,514
and 100 million people.
Having studied it as a foreign language 

19
00:00:58,070 --> 00:00:58,903
in both the United States and in Europe,
it is the third most widely taught 

20
00:01:02,061 --> 00:01:02,900
foreign language.

21
00:01:03,770 --> 00:01:07,370
Did you know that one 10th of the 
world's books are published in German.

22
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:11,120
German is also the second most widely 
used scientific language.

23
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:15,050
I know some doctors and all of them have
some reading knowledge of German because

24
00:01:15,051 --> 00:01:17,660
so much scientific research has 
documented in German,

25
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:20,960
so are you starting to get an idea of 
why German is important?

26
00:01:22,370 --> 00:01:25,400
German is a member of the West Germanic 
language family,

27
00:01:25,401 --> 00:01:27,890
which also includes Dutch,
Africans,

28
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:29,930
Friesian,
English and Yiddish.

29
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:33,830
The West Germanic languages are part of 
the wider Germanic language family.

30
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:36,980
So let's take a look at the origins of 
the dramatic language family.

31
00:01:37,610 --> 00:01:38,421
Wait,
actually no,

32
00:01:38,421 --> 00:01:39,254
I did this in my last video,
so I'm just going to play that part 

33
00:01:41,841 --> 00:01:44,390
again while I go get a coffee and I'll 
be right back.

34
00:01:44,450 --> 00:01:47,450
All Germanic languages developed from 
Provo Germanic,

35
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:48,313
which was spoken around 500 bce.
Protoje dramatic possibly originated in 

36
00:01:52,251 --> 00:01:53,084
Scandinavia,
and different varieties of Germanic 

37
00:01:55,070 --> 00:01:55,903
began to emerge with migration.
Runic inscriptions from the second 

38
00:01:58,851 --> 00:01:59,684
century ce show us that by that time,
pro dramatic had began to separate into 

39
00:02:03,501 --> 00:02:06,350
distinct western,
eastern and northern dialects.

40
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:09,911
Oh,
sorry.

41
00:02:09,911 --> 00:02:11,170
Are you guys waiting for me?

42
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,140
Well,
let's move on.

43
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:14,363
The West dramatic dialects were probably
closely related enough to be mutually 

44
00:02:17,431 --> 00:02:20,070
intelligible until about the eighth 
century ce,

45
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:24,000
but at that time something was happening
that would split their dramatic language

46
00:02:24,001 --> 00:02:27,300
family and give birth to the German 
language as we know it today.

47
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:31,950
That was the hydromatic sounds shift or 
the hydromatic continental shift.

48
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:36,060
Some west Germanic varieties underwent a
number of sound changes,

49
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,073
nine consonants changed to be precise 
and this created two distinct groups of 

50
00:02:40,921 --> 00:02:41,754
Germanic dialect,
high German or Deutsche and low German 

51
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:49,440
or plot doidge and just out of interest,
let me pronounce these words a different

52
00:02:49,441 --> 00:02:51,850
way.
High Deutsche and flat,

53
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:52,803
which maybe there's a connection with 
English high German dialects arose in 

54
00:02:56,581 --> 00:02:59,680
the southern areas of Germany which are 
at a higher elevation.

55
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:00,543
That's why they're called hydrogen.
The low German dialects existed in the 

56
00:03:03,671 --> 00:03:07,300
northern part of Germany at a lower 
elevation and also in the Netherlands.

57
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:09,910
These terms do not refer to high end low
status,

58
00:03:09,911 --> 00:03:12,790
but rather to the elevation of the areas
they were spoken in,

59
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:16,330
hydrogen can be further subdivided into 
two segments,

60
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:20,440
upper German and central German.
So what were the sound changes that took

61
00:03:20,441 --> 00:03:21,071
place?
Well,

62
00:03:21,071 --> 00:03:21,904
let's take a look.
These consonant changes took place in 

63
00:03:23,981 --> 00:03:25,900
three stages.
In the first stage,

64
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:28,260
these consonants changed.
Interval calendly,

65
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:32,810
that means between vowel sounds,
the p sound that became a foot,

66
00:03:33,490 --> 00:03:37,980
this to sound became a sub,
and the sound became a cup.

67
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:40,720
Here's an example for the English word.
For Sleep.

68
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:45,930
In Low German it's sloppy,
but in German it's in the second stage.

69
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:47,703
These continents changed at the 
beginning of a word and also in some 

70
00:03:50,201 --> 00:03:51,034
other context,
like if they are the second letter in a 

71
00:03:53,171 --> 00:03:54,004
double consonant or after an l or an r 
sound book became per foot like a p and 

72
00:03:59,430 --> 00:03:59,800
an f.

73
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:00,633
together the sound became a son.
It sounds like a ts sound even though 

74
00:04:04,961 --> 00:04:09,961
it's written with a z and the sound 
became a like a k sound followed by cup.

75
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:13,270
Here's an example for the English word 
Tame.

76
00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:16,770
In lower German it's tem,
but in high German it's,

77
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:20,080
I'm in the third stage.
Three more consonants changed.

78
00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:21,123
The book sound became a Po that the 
sound became a ta in the sound became a 

79
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:26,453
CCO.
Here's an example for the English word 

80
00:04:27,971 --> 00:04:30,520
for day in lower German,
it's f,

81
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:31,683
but in high German it's talk.
Now all of these sound changes took 

82
00:04:34,781 --> 00:04:36,640
place in upper German,
in the south,

83
00:04:36,641 --> 00:04:37,474
but some of them didn't take place in 
central German and some of them didn't 

84
00:04:40,151 --> 00:04:40,984
take place in standard German,
but we'll get to standard German in a 

85
00:04:43,601 --> 00:04:45,370
minute.
So some of you might be thinking,

86
00:04:45,371 --> 00:04:47,440
well,
how did these sounds just switch.

87
00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:49,240
Well,
they didn't instantly switch.

88
00:04:49,241 --> 00:04:52,180
They gradually changed over a period of 
a few centuries,

89
00:04:52,181 --> 00:04:56,590
probably between the fifth century and 
18th century ce over the centuries,

90
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:57,453
the dialect continuum of low German had 
high German grew more and more distinct 

91
00:05:00,971 --> 00:05:04,060
until there were varieties that were 
quite incomprehensible,

92
00:05:04,061 --> 00:05:04,894
so someone from the south in Bavaria 
would have trouble communicating with 

93
00:05:07,601 --> 00:05:08,434
someone from Hamburg in the north.
But of course that was before standard 

94
00:05:11,411 --> 00:05:12,244
German.
The dialects of low German are often 

95
00:05:13,721 --> 00:05:14,554
said to be a separate language from high
German and there are often sent to be 

96
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:18,363
halfway between high German and Dutch.
Now the low German dialect actually 

97
00:05:21,851 --> 00:05:22,684
crosses the border into the eastern part
of the Netherlands where low German has 

98
00:05:25,531 --> 00:05:26,364
also spoken,
but these days the low German dialects 

99
00:05:28,481 --> 00:05:29,314
in the north of the country are mostly 
fading and basically only older people 

100
00:05:32,711 --> 00:05:35,020
speak them.
Younger people might understand them,

101
00:05:35,021 --> 00:05:37,270
but they tend to use standard German 
instead,

102
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:39,880
but when did standard German come into 
the picture?

103
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:41,013
Standard German,
which by the way is also called 

104
00:05:42,671 --> 00:05:43,504
Hochdeutsch in German,
so don't be confused between hydrogen 

105
00:05:45,521 --> 00:05:46,354
and standard German,
originated as a written literary 

106
00:05:48,761 --> 00:05:49,594
language that developed over a few 
hundred years as writers tried to write 

107
00:05:52,601 --> 00:05:53,434
in a way that would be understood by the
largest number of people possible from 

108
00:05:56,320 --> 00:06:00,050
different dialect areas,
but perhaps the most important factor in

109
00:06:00,051 --> 00:06:03,860
the development of standard German was 
the translation of the Bible into German

110
00:06:03,861 --> 00:06:06,620
by Martin Luther in the year 15,
22.

111
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:10,550
He based his translation on the sex in 
dialect of central German,

112
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:13,760
while including some vocabulary from 
other dialects as well.

113
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:14,773
Virtually all speakers of German 
dialects owned a copy of the new Bible 

114
00:06:17,601 --> 00:06:21,320
and studied it effectively popularizing 
this form of written German.

115
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:25,370
Originally there was no single way to 
pronounce this written form of German,

116
00:06:25,371 --> 00:06:29,900
but eventually the dialect of Hanover 
became the standard for pronunciation of

117
00:06:29,901 --> 00:06:30,734
standard German.

118
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:36,763
Standard German includes some of the 
sounds of the High German continental 

119
00:06:39,471 --> 00:06:40,304
shift,
but not all of them because it was 

120
00:06:41,721 --> 00:06:42,554
influenced by the dialect of Hanover,
so standard German began as a written 

121
00:06:45,921 --> 00:06:46,754
language,
but as it became the language of 

122
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:48,913
education,
it became more widespread as the formal 

123
00:06:50,901 --> 00:06:54,080
spoken language and it also influenced 
the local dialects.

124
00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:55,063
Today,
pretty much everyone can speak standard 

125
00:06:56,451 --> 00:06:57,284
German,
even if they speak a local dialect 

126
00:06:58,761 --> 00:06:59,594
casually and many local dialects have 
become largely replaced by standard 

127
00:07:02,961 --> 00:07:03,794
German,
especially the low German dialects in 

128
00:07:05,271 --> 00:07:06,104
the north of the country,
but there are still some dialects that 

129
00:07:08,061 --> 00:07:08,894
are quite distinct and still thriving 
like the Bavarian dialect in the South 

130
00:07:12,410 --> 00:07:15,320
East German is considered a plurry 
centric language.

131
00:07:15,321 --> 00:07:18,770
That means that there are multiple 
standard varieties of the language.

132
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,990
There is one standard language in 
Germany,

133
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:21,973
one in Australia and one in Switzerland.
All of these standard varieties are 

134
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:28,100
pretty much the same except for some 
differing vocabulary,

135
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,233
but of course those are the standard 
language of Switzerland and Austria and 

136
00:07:31,761 --> 00:07:34,370
also south to roll,
which is related to Austria,

137
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,350
have their own dialects as well.

138
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:37,633
The Austrian dialects or related to the 
Bavarian dialects in South East Germany 

139
00:07:41,090 --> 00:07:41,923
and the Swiss dialects are related to 
the element of dialects in southwest 

140
00:07:45,021 --> 00:07:45,854
Germany.
Maybe you saw my video about the 

141
00:07:47,391 --> 00:07:48,224
languages of Switzerland.
It's this one right here and in that 

142
00:07:50,871 --> 00:07:51,704
video I talked about how the Swiss 
German dialects are kind of 

143
00:07:54,110 --> 00:07:59,110
incomprehensible to speakers of standard
German unless they also speak in dialect

144
00:07:59,631 --> 00:08:00,464
from the border area,
but of course that's talking about the 

145
00:08:02,691 --> 00:08:03,524
Swiss German dialects.
Swiss Germans can speak standard German 

146
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:09,050
even if they tend to use it less than 
people in Germany.

147
00:08:09,470 --> 00:08:12,410
Of course they might pronounce standard 
German with a different accent,

148
00:08:12,411 --> 00:08:15,370
but that's no big deal in Austria and 
south to roll.

149
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:18,530
The situation is similar.
There are dialects that might be hard to

150
00:08:18,531 --> 00:08:21,590
understand for people from some other 
German speaking countries,

151
00:08:21,591 --> 00:08:23,900
but of course standard German is the 
bridge.

152
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:26,730
These countries are all part of the 
German sprocket,

153
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:27,320
Rome.

154
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:28,153
Wow.
So which means the geographic area over 

155
00:08:30,531 --> 00:08:31,364
which that language is spoken,
and within that sprocket round standard 

156
00:08:34,371 --> 00:08:36,650
German is the doc sprocket.
That profit,

157
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:37,673
that means the umbrella language under 
which all of those dialects can come 

158
00:08:40,671 --> 00:08:43,600
together.
Those two German terms I just used brock

159
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:48,380
and are common linguistic terms and I 
think that shows just how much influence

160
00:08:48,381 --> 00:08:52,430
the German language has over academic 
areas of research like linguistics.

161
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:54,470
So what is the German language like?
Well,

162
00:08:54,471 --> 00:08:55,304
it's closely related to English,
which is obvious when we look at the 

163
00:08:57,691 --> 00:09:00,120
most basic sentences.
Here's an example.

164
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:01,770
I buy books often.

165
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:05,900
It's cold for whole fish booster.
Each cow,

166
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:08,280
Hoy who shot

167
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:11,260
hear the word order is Svo,
like in English,

168
00:09:11,290 --> 00:09:15,130
except that the adverb comes before the 
object instead of after it.

169
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:17,680
Here's another example with an important
twist.

170
00:09:17,950 --> 00:09:19,480
I will buy the book today.

171
00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:23,590
You've added a spool quite often each 
voucher,

172
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:25,810
just calvin.

173
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:26,913
In this case,
we see one of the most confusing things 

174
00:09:28,481 --> 00:09:29,314
for learners of German,
which is the placement of the second 

175
00:09:31,091 --> 00:09:31,924
verb at the end of the sentence.
So if there's a helping verb like will 

176
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:38,320
or voucher,
it is in the normal Svo position,

177
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:41,350
but the main verb goes at the end.
Another example,

178
00:09:41,410 --> 00:09:42,610
the book was interesting

179
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:48,150
just via to the sun does va into the 
sand.

180
00:09:49,510 --> 00:09:52,450
And one more example,
I like people who work hard

181
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:56,410
ish.
Mark mentioned to your hot button issue,

182
00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:00,570
mark mentioned the heart operation.

183
00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:02,823
Another thing that learners have German 
find challenging is the case system in 

184
00:10:06,041 --> 00:10:06,874
German,
in German pronouns and nouns changed 

185
00:10:08,861 --> 00:10:11,080
form depending on their function in the 
sentence,

186
00:10:11,081 --> 00:10:14,740
but along with them,
the articles and adjectives also change.

187
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:19,150
Here's an example of German grammatical 
cases using the now meaning table,

188
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:24,540
the acting dean,
Trish just deem Tisha did.

189
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:26,890
Tisha,
Tisha,

190
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,073
yeah,
sure.

191
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:31,093
You can see that the change takes place 
not only in the noun but also in the 

192
00:10:33,921 --> 00:10:34,754
definite article as well.
The word for table is a masculine nouns 

193
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:38,473
in German,
but there are actually three genders in 

194
00:10:40,281 --> 00:10:41,780
German.
There are masculine nouns,

195
00:10:41,781 --> 00:10:44,540
feminine nouns and Neuter Nouns,
and for each of them,

196
00:10:44,570 --> 00:10:45,403
the case forms are different,
and all of these different forms also 

197
00:10:48,291 --> 00:10:51,230
apply to adjectives which drives 
learners crazy.

198
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:54,080
So while German is closely related to 
English,

199
00:10:54,110 --> 00:10:54,943
the devil is in the details,
even though most of the other Germanic 

200
00:10:57,501 --> 00:10:59,870
languages are classified as category 
one.

201
00:10:59,871 --> 00:11:03,920
Languages by the Fsi,
German is classified as category two,

202
00:11:04,190 --> 00:11:05,023
it's closely related to English and they
have a lot in common in terms of the 

203
00:11:07,581 --> 00:11:11,630
general syntax and vocabulary,
but when it comes to the fine details of

204
00:11:11,631 --> 00:11:13,730
grammar,
there are some challenges for learners,

205
00:11:13,850 --> 00:11:16,310
but as always,
if you are interested in German speaking

206
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:19,130
cultures and countries,
or if you would like to benefit from the

207
00:11:19,131 --> 00:11:22,580
widespread use of German,
then don't hesitate to start learning.

208
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:26,320
All challenges become adventures when 
you become fascinated.

209
00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:27,223
The question of the day German speakers,
do you think there's anything unique or 

210
00:11:29,901 --> 00:11:30,734
special or interesting about your local 
variety of German and how do other 

211
00:11:34,161 --> 00:11:34,994
varieties of German sound to you?
Let us know in the comments down below

and everyone else jump in and let's 
discuss.

213
00:11:40,310 --> 00:11:42,220
Thank you for watching and have a nice.
