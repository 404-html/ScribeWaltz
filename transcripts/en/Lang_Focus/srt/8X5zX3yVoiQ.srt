Hello everyone,
welcome to the channel and my name is 

2
00:00:08,821 --> 00:00:12,030
Paul.
Today's topic is the Scots language.

3
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:14,670
Scott's is a language spoken in 
Scotland,

4
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:17,310
one of the constituent countries of the 
United Kingdom.

5
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:18,323
Right off the bat,
it's important to point out that there 

6
00:00:19,651 --> 00:00:22,140
are essentially three different 
languages in Scotland,

7
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:23,220
Scottish,
English,

8
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:27,630
Scott's and garlic.
Garlic is a Celtic language that is only

9
00:00:27,631 --> 00:00:31,440
distantly related to English and Scots 
as an endo European language.

10
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:32,460
Scott,
since Scottish,

11
00:00:32,461 --> 00:00:35,460
English on the other hand,
are closely related to each other,

12
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:36,443
though they're not the same thing.
Scottish English is for the most part 

13
00:00:39,331 --> 00:00:41,910
standard English,
but spoken with a Scottish accent.

14
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:42,893
Scott's on the other hand,
is distinct having diverged from a 

15
00:00:45,301 --> 00:00:48,540
dialect of middle English and having 
features that differ from English.

16
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:49,463
Some people consider Scott's to be a 
separate language while others consider 

17
00:00:52,231 --> 00:00:54,390
it to be a historical dialect of 
English,

18
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:56,640
just like the historical dialects found 
in England,

19
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:58,470
but we'll get into that a little bit 
later.

20
00:00:58,650 --> 00:00:59,483
According to the 2011 Scottish census,
just over one point $5 million people 

21
00:01:03,211 --> 00:01:04,044
speak.
Scott's around 30 percent of the 

22
00:01:05,341 --> 00:01:09,610
Scottish population history.
The roots of Scott's lion,

23
00:01:09,611 --> 00:01:13,150
north Umbria and old English,
one of several old English dialects,

24
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:14,483
Northumbria and old English was being 
spoken by the seventh century in the 

25
00:01:17,711 --> 00:01:18,544
Anglo Saxon Kingdom of North Umbria,
which was located in northeastern 

26
00:01:21,611 --> 00:01:23,590
England,
and part of the Scottish lowlands.

27
00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:26,980
The Kingdom of Scotland was founded in 
the year 8:43

28
00:01:27,010 --> 00:01:30,280
with the unification of the pig dish 
people and golic speaking.

29
00:01:30,281 --> 00:01:31,114
Scott's but English speaking.
Northumbria and lance were not yet part 

30
00:01:33,971 --> 00:01:34,804
of the kingdom when the northern part of
North Umbria finally became part of 

31
00:01:38,501 --> 00:01:40,270
Scotland.
In the 11th century,

32
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:42,970
Golic became the prestige language of 
the area,

33
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:46,000
but English remained the most widely 
spoken language.

34
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:47,733
The variety of English spoken there may 
have been significantly influenced by 

35
00:01:50,921 --> 00:01:53,500
norse because the southern part of North
Umbria,

36
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,930
along with much of northern and eastern 
England,

37
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:58,570
had been under Danish control and it's 
English.

38
00:01:58,570 --> 00:01:59,403
Dialects had been influenced by norse 
and Scandinavian settlers were also 

39
00:02:02,891 --> 00:02:05,410
present beyond the border of that area 
as well.

40
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:09,040
In the twelfth and 13th centuries during
the middle English period,

41
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,113
the [inaudible] system of administrative
division led to the spread of English 

42
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:16,900
further into Scotland borrows.
We're autonomous urban communities where

43
00:02:16,901 --> 00:02:17,950
traders,
merchants,

44
00:02:17,951 --> 00:02:18,784
and craftsmen could live and do business
in exchange for paying taxes on their 

45
00:02:21,851 --> 00:02:22,684
earnings.
The bureaus were ruled by nobles who 

46
00:02:24,311 --> 00:02:25,144
answered to the King.
They attract an economic migrants from 

47
00:02:27,461 --> 00:02:28,294
other parts of Scotland,
including golic speaking areas from 

48
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:31,413
England,
especially from areas that had been 

49
00:02:32,831 --> 00:02:33,664
under Danish control,
where North's influenced dialects were 

50
00:02:35,681 --> 00:02:38,740
spoken and from farther away places like
flenders,

51
00:02:38,741 --> 00:02:39,574
phrygia and Scandinavia.
English became the common language of 

52
00:02:43,001 --> 00:02:45,790
the boroughs,
but the multilingual environment created

53
00:02:45,791 --> 00:02:48,640
by the economic migrants had an 
influence on the language,

54
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:52,300
so as English became more widespread in 
Scotland because of the boroughs,

55
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:55,420
it also began to diverged from North 
Umbria and middle English.

56
00:02:55,630 --> 00:02:56,463
Other influences were Latin because of 
its role as the ecclesiastical and the 

57
00:03:00,101 --> 00:03:00,934
language of laws and record keeping and 
Norman French because of the influence 

58
00:03:04,331 --> 00:03:07,360
of King David.
The first who had close ties with Norman

59
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,193
England.
The divergent variety of middle English 

60
00:03:09,911 --> 00:03:13,480
that grew out of these influences is now
referred to as early Scott's,

61
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:14,373
but at the time it continued to be 
referred to as English until the end of 

62
00:03:17,081 --> 00:03:20,290
the 15th century.
In the 14th and 15th centuries,

63
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:24,340
English replaced and garlic and much of 
the lowlands as well as replacing French

64
00:03:24,341 --> 00:03:25,174
as the administrative language,
as well as replacing Latin as the 

65
00:03:27,581 --> 00:03:28,414
language of records and law.
Another thing that happened in the 15th 

66
00:03:31,031 --> 00:03:34,930
century was that the Orkney islands and 
the Shetland islands came under Scottish

67
00:03:34,931 --> 00:03:37,510
rule.
Scandinavian settlers had been living on

68
00:03:37,511 --> 00:03:38,344
these islands since the ninth century 
and spoke a language called norm that 

69
00:03:41,381 --> 00:03:44,650
derived from old norse,
but Scott speaking,

70
00:03:44,651 --> 00:03:45,484
settlers began to move there and the 
prestige language became Scott's from 

71
00:03:48,761 --> 00:03:49,600
this contact.

72
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:50,493
New dialects of Scott's would develop 
with more influence than other forms of 

73
00:03:53,861 --> 00:03:56,020
Scott's.
These dialects are shetland,

74
00:03:56,021 --> 00:03:58,840
Scott's and slash or Kadian,
Scott's or orkney.

75
00:03:59,350 --> 00:04:00,183
By this point,
scots had become fairly distinct from 

76
00:04:02,171 --> 00:04:03,004
English as spoken in England.
One thing that set them apart was that 

77
00:04:05,711 --> 00:04:09,310
the southern English dialect of London 
was becoming the standard in England,

78
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:12,490
whereas Scott's had more in common with 
the northern dialects.

79
00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:15,790
Another thing that set them apart was 
the great vowel shift.

80
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:18,730
The great vowels shift took place 
between the years 13,

81
00:04:18,731 --> 00:04:19,564
15 and 1600 more or less and caused 
vowels of English to be pronounced 

82
00:04:23,141 --> 00:04:25,360
differently.
This also affected Scott's,

83
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,433
although the specific changes we're 
different and some vowels that changed 

84
00:04:29,261 --> 00:04:31,630
in English remained unchanged.
In Scott's,

85
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:33,610
for example,
in middle English,

86
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:34,361
the letters,
Oh,

87
00:04:34,361 --> 00:04:37,660
you represented the sound uhhh in 
southern English,

88
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:41,080
and thus in standard English,
this sounds shifted to our,

89
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:43,450
but in Scott's,
it remained unchanged.

90
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:46,480
So today in standard English you say 
mouse,

91
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:51,600
but in Scott's you say Moose and a brown
cow and English is a Brune coup in scots

92
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:55,353
who knew broom?
The great vowel shifts took place at 

93
00:04:58,031 --> 00:05:01,510
about the same time that English 
orthography was becoming standardized,

94
00:05:01,511 --> 00:05:05,530
so that English spelling often reflected
earlier middle English pronunciation,

95
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:08,080
and it still does today.
Scott's on the other hand,

96
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:11,260
was written more freely to reflect the 
way it was really pronounced.

97
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:12,303
An extensive body of Scott's literature 
was written in the 15th and 16th 

98
00:05:15,341 --> 00:05:17,860
centuries,
but towards the end of that time period,

99
00:05:17,890 --> 00:05:18,723
as English was growing in prestige,
Scott's was increasingly being written 

100
00:05:21,911 --> 00:05:24,160
using a combination of scots and 
English.
