00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:03,340
I have no idea how to make a funny 
introduction for this video,

2
00:00:03,341 --> 00:00:05,950
so instead I'm going to give you a quick
slideshow of cool,

3
00:00:05,951 --> 00:00:07,150
awesome slavek stuff.

4
00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:08,083
Go.

5
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:18,863
Hello everyone.
Welcome to the Lange Focus Channel and 

6
00:00:20,611 --> 00:00:24,210
my name is Paul.
Today I'm going to talk about the Slavic

7
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:25,073
languages.
They may not get as much attention as 

8
00:00:27,271 --> 00:00:29,520
the romance languages and the Germanic 
languages,

9
00:00:29,521 --> 00:00:30,354
but the Slavic languages are an 
important family of languages with $315 

10
00:00:33,741 --> 00:00:37,170
million native speakers and covering 
over half the area of Europe.

11
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:39,293
That includes Eastern Europe,
the balcones as well as the European 

12
00:00:41,701 --> 00:00:42,534
part of Russia,
and of course the Asian part of Russia 

13
00:00:44,491 --> 00:00:48,210
as well,
Slavic languages or a branch of the Indo

14
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:49,043
European language family.
If we go all the way back to the 

15
00:00:51,271 --> 00:00:53,410
beginning that there was a language 
called [inaudible],

16
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:54,293
Indo European,
which is the language from which all 

17
00:00:56,131 --> 00:00:59,790
Indo European languages descended.
That includes the romance languages.

18
00:00:59,791 --> 00:01:00,624
That dramatic language is to enjoy 
running in languages and of course the 

19
00:01:03,121 --> 00:01:03,954
Slavic languages as well as others.
One language that developed from Indo 

20
00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:10,440
European was pro tow Bulto Slavic.

21
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:11,423
That language is the ancestor of both 
the Baltic languages and the Slavic 

22
00:01:14,551 --> 00:01:17,280
languages,
but the Slavic language family broke off

23
00:01:17,281 --> 00:01:21,990
from Provo Balto slavek around 1,500
to 1000 bce.

24
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:26,160
The language then underwent a 2000 year 
period of gradual development,

25
00:01:26,161 --> 00:01:30,540
but during that time it remained a 
single unified language around 500 ce.

26
00:01:30,541 --> 00:01:31,374
There was a language called protos 
slavic that would later split and would 

27
00:01:34,111 --> 00:01:37,050
give birth to all of the modern Slavic 
languages of today.

28
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:40,620
Protos slavek was the ancestor of all 
Slavic languages.

29
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:41,513
The time between 500 cm,
1000 ce was called the common slavek 

30
00:01:45,121 --> 00:01:46,530
period,
and during this period,

31
00:01:46,531 --> 00:01:51,531
protos slavek began to diverge into 
dialects and that Slavic people migrated

32
00:01:51,631 --> 00:01:52,464
over a wider area.
Those differences increased by about 

33
00:01:55,171 --> 00:01:58,350
$1,000.
Seed there were distinct west Slavek,

34
00:01:58,410 --> 00:02:02,820
east Slavic and South Slavic languages.
Those three languages would later become

35
00:02:02,821 --> 00:02:05,490
three branches of the Slavic language 
family,

36
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:06,443
and the dialects of those languages 
would become the different languages in 

37
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:10,013
each branch.

38
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:12,780
The East Slavic languages include 
Russian,

39
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,960
Ukrainian,
and Bella Lucien,

40
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:15,803
which is sometimes called White Russian,
South Slavic language family includes 

41
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:21,720
Serbo,
Croatian,

42
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:24,210
Bulgarian Macedonian,
which are very similar,

43
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:25,133
Slovenian,
and also the liturgical language known 

44
00:02:27,541 --> 00:02:31,110
as old church.
Slavonic slavonic just means Slavic.

45
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:34,140
The West Slavic languages include 
Polish,

46
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,400
Czech,
Slovak,

47
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:36,303
Serbian,
which is a minority language in eastern 

48
00:02:38,011 --> 00:02:40,950
Germany,
job in which is a minority language.

49
00:02:40,951 --> 00:02:41,784
In Poland,
the Slavic languages are much closer to 

50
00:02:44,761 --> 00:02:48,390
each other then the languages of other 
into European language families.

51
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:49,373
That's because protos slavek split into 
different languages relatively recently 

52
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:56,040
compared to other language families like
Germanic and romance.

53
00:02:56,190 --> 00:03:00,010
Some people claimed that all slavic 
languages are mutually intelligible to a

54
00:03:00,011 --> 00:03:01,780
large degree,
but that's not really true,

55
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:02,793
but from what I understand,
the speaker of any Slavic language can 

56
00:03:05,801 --> 00:03:06,634
probably find a way to make some sort of
simple conversation with the speaker of 

57
00:03:10,061 --> 00:03:13,240
any other Slavic language or most other 
Slavic languages.

58
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:15,250
That doesn't mean they can understand 
everything,

59
00:03:15,251 --> 00:03:17,260
but that means when they're talking face
to face,

60
00:03:17,261 --> 00:03:18,094
maybe they can find a way to communicate
and within each of those three branches 

61
00:03:21,341 --> 00:03:22,174
of the language family,
there seems to be quite a lot of mutual 

62
00:03:24,311 --> 00:03:25,900
intelligibility.
For example,

63
00:03:25,901 --> 00:03:26,734
the East slavek branch,
here are some average figures from 

64
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:31,210
native speakers statements on the 
Internet,

65
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:32,253
so for Russian speakers,
Bella Lucien is about 74 percent 

66
00:03:35,471 --> 00:03:36,304
intelligible and it's spoken for them an
85 percent intelligible in its written 

67
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:43,060
form.
Ukrainian is 50 percent intelligible and

68
00:03:43,061 --> 00:03:46,780
it's spoken for them and 85 percent 
intelligible in its written form,

69
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:49,630
but in both cases there were also a 
transitional dialects.

70
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:50,493
For example,
the Ukrainian is more similar to the 

71
00:03:52,541 --> 00:03:53,374
Russian dialects in the south of the 
country rather than the standard 

72
00:03:55,691 --> 00:03:58,270
language which is based on dialects of 
the north,

73
00:03:58,330 --> 00:03:59,163
so speakers of those southern Russian 
dialects might have an easier time 

74
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,640
communicating with someone from Ukraine.

75
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:07,870
Here's another example from a lang focus
viewer named anointed fighter.

76
00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:10,270
He says,
I'm a native Bulgarian speaker.

77
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:13,690
I can understand 80 percent Serbian and 
80 percent Russian,

78
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:14,553
especially if they are written Czech 
Slovakia and Slovenia and I can get 60 

79
00:04:17,861 --> 00:04:22,270
percent and from Polish only 40 percent 
to Bulgaria and Serbia and are both part

80
00:04:22,271 --> 00:04:26,050
of the South Slavic branch so he can 
understand 80 percent of Serbian,

81
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:27,063
but he can also understand 80 percent of
Russian even though it's in the East 

82
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:30,513
slavek branch.
Slavic was still a single unified 

83
00:04:32,531 --> 00:04:33,364
language in the ninth century when the 
first known slavic writings were 

84
00:04:36,251 --> 00:04:37,084
written.
These writings were written in old 

85
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:40,840
church slavonic slavonic just means 
slavek.

86
00:04:40,841 --> 00:04:41,674
Remember it was the first slavek 
literary language and it was 

87
00:04:43,841 --> 00:04:44,674
standardized by the Saint Cyril and 
methodius so that they could translate 

88
00:04:47,831 --> 00:04:48,664
the Bible and other religious works into
the Slavic language and they could 

89
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:55,090
minister to the slabs and convert them 
to Christianity.

90
00:04:55,210 --> 00:04:57,300
At this point,
there were slavic dialects,

91
00:04:57,310 --> 00:04:59,290
but they were still relatively close to 
each other.

92
00:04:59,291 --> 00:05:02,410
So old church slavonic was widely 
understood.

93
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:03,453
Old Church slavonic went on to become 
the language of religious ceremony for 

94
00:05:06,851 --> 00:05:09,940
the eastern Orthodox Church and the 
eastern Catholic church,

95
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:12,190
and it's still used by many churches 
today.

96
00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:13,203
One of the writing system,
Cyril and methodius used to write old 

97
00:05:15,581 --> 00:05:16,414
church slavonic was the cyrillic script,
so the word cyrillic comes from the 

98
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:23,020
Saints Names Cyril.
The cyrillic script was adapted from the

99
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:28,050
old Greek script with some additional 
letters to represent sounds found in old

100
00:05:28,151 --> 00:05:30,850
church slavonic that were not found in 
Greek today.

101
00:05:30,851 --> 00:05:34,450
There are Slavic languages written in 
cyrillic script and there are also those

102
00:05:34,451 --> 00:05:36,940
written in variations of the Latin 
script.

103
00:05:37,090 --> 00:05:37,923
Those written in the cyrillic script 
tend to be for cultures in which the 

104
00:05:40,421 --> 00:05:43,690
eastern Orthodox or eastern Catholic 
church are dominant.

105
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:44,703
Those written in the Latin script tend 
to be for cultures in which the Roman 

106
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,790
Catholic church is dominant.

107
00:05:48,970 --> 00:05:49,803
One of the common features of Slavic 
languages aside from Bulgarian and 

108
00:05:52,771 --> 00:05:57,070
Macedonian is that the nouns and 
pronouns are highly inflected.

109
00:05:57,290 --> 00:05:58,123
Have many grammatical cases.
Grammatical case means that the noun or 

110
00:06:01,011 --> 00:06:05,210
a pronoun changes form depending on its 
function in the sentence in English.

111
00:06:05,211 --> 00:06:07,730
The only example we have of this is with
the pronouns.

112
00:06:07,731 --> 00:06:08,564
For example,
I is the subject for him and me is the 

113
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:12,133
object form,
but nouns can have multiple forums like 

114
00:06:14,241 --> 00:06:16,610
this as well.
If they have grammatical cases,

115
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:19,970
Slavic languages have up to seven 
different grammatical cases.

116
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:20,983
Let's look at an example for the Polish 
word for bottle with Telefonica 

117
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:28,120
Boutiquey hotel.
It's a Teleco Teleco.

118
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,433
We tell them say,
so the word bottle changes form 

119
00:06:31,461 --> 00:06:32,294
depending on which case it's being used.
I won't go through each one and say 

120
00:06:34,851 --> 00:06:35,684
which case it is,
but you can see that the form of the 

121
00:06:37,371 --> 00:06:38,204
noun changes for people whose native 
language is not a highly inflected 

122
00:06:41,601 --> 00:06:43,570
language with grammatical cases like 
that.

123
00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:45,680
This can make learning a slavic 
language,

124
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:46,543
a challenge.
You not only have to memorize those 

125
00:06:47,901 --> 00:06:49,580
different forums,
but when you're speaking,

126
00:06:49,581 --> 00:06:53,000
you have to constantly be aware of which
form the word should be,

127
00:06:53,001 --> 00:06:55,430
which function the word is fulfilling in
the sentence.

128
00:06:55,670 --> 00:06:56,503
Another characteristic of Slavic 
languages is that they don't have 

129
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:01,910
articles.
That means like the or are in English,

130
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:05,270
and again the exception is Bulgarian and
Macedonian.

131
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:09,410
For some reason the lack of grammatical 
cases and the presence of articles might

132
00:07:09,411 --> 00:07:11,600
make Bulgarian Macedonian easier to 
learn,

133
00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:12,643
but the most widely studied slavic 
language is Russian and that's probably 

134
00:07:15,771 --> 00:07:16,604
because it's the most widely spoken.
There are $150 million native speakers 

135
00:07:20,031 --> 00:07:20,864
of Russian,
and if we include second language 

136
00:07:22,191 --> 00:07:23,024
speakers,
there are $260 million proficient 

137
00:07:24,921 --> 00:07:25,754
speakers.
The second most widely spoken is Polish 

138
00:07:28,041 --> 00:07:28,874
with around $40 million native speakers.
The third most widely spoken is 

139
00:07:31,911 --> 00:07:34,220
Ukrainian with about $30 million 
speakers.

140
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:38,420
The fourth is Serbo Croatian with about 
19 million speakers and yes,

141
00:07:38,421 --> 00:07:41,540
I know some people consider those to be 
separate languages,

142
00:07:41,541 --> 00:07:44,420
but I will leave that topic for a 
different video for now.

143
00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:45,523
The fifth is checked with 10 million 
people and of course there are numerous 

144
00:07:48,621 --> 00:07:51,200
other important slavic languages to 
really.

145
00:07:51,201 --> 00:07:52,034
There's so much to say about the various
different Slavic languages that I can't 

146
00:07:54,531 --> 00:07:55,364
talk about it all in one video,
but please stay tuned for future videos 

147
00:07:58,251 --> 00:08:00,950
in which I talk about specific Slavic 
languages.

148
00:08:01,010 --> 00:08:02,840
So that brings us to the end of this 
video.

149
00:08:02,841 --> 00:08:07,310
But the question of the day for Slavic 
language speakers is can you communicate

150
00:08:07,311 --> 00:08:10,610
with the speakers of different slavic 
languages and if so,

151
00:08:10,611 --> 00:08:11,444
which ones?
Is it just the ones in your language 

152
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:15,290
branch,
like East Slavek or South Slavic,

153
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:18,890
or can you communicate with the speakers
in other branches as well?

154
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:19,903
Let us know in the comments down below 
and other people you can comment about 

155
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,650
whatever you want.
Alright.

156
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:26,950
Thank you for watching and have a nice.
