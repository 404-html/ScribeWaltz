Hello everyone.

3
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:08,370
Welcome to the Lange Focus Channel and 
my name is Paul.

4
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:09,273
Today's video is a quick video to 
explain a concept that I often talk 

5
00:00:12,161 --> 00:00:12,994
about in my videos,
but the viewer sometimes don't 

6
00:00:14,441 --> 00:00:16,750
understand and they ask me about in the 
comments.

7
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:17,793
The concept is grammatical case case 
refers to the grammatical function of a 

8
00:00:21,731 --> 00:00:24,430
noun or a pronoun in the sentence.
For example,

9
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:26,380
if these are all the words in a 
sentence,

10
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:29,100
eight lion honeybadger.
Ah,

11
00:00:29,350 --> 00:00:31,660
there are two possible messages.
This one,

12
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:34,540
the lion ate the honeybadger or this 
one,

13
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:38,830
the honey badger eight the lion.
There are two roles in the sentence.

14
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:42,190
The animal doing the eating and the 
animal being eaten in English.

15
00:00:42,191 --> 00:00:45,580
We normally know which role announced as
fulfilling based on word order.

16
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:50,050
The subject of the sentence comes here 
and the object of a sentence comes here.

17
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:52,810
Prepositions can also tell us announce 
function.

18
00:00:52,870 --> 00:00:53,703
For example,
the honey badger gave a warning to the 

19
00:00:55,571 --> 00:00:58,390
snake.
The preposition to tells us the snake is

20
00:00:58,391 --> 00:01:00,580
the indirect object receiving the 
action.

21
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:02,853
But in many languages,
word order and prepositions are not the 

22
00:01:04,961 --> 00:01:06,850
main ways to show the function of it.
Now,

23
00:01:06,970 --> 00:01:07,803
the form of the now might change or a 
special ending might be added to the 

24
00:01:10,511 --> 00:01:12,340
word to show what's function in the 
sentence.

25
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:13,263
In English,
we do this to show possession like in 

26
00:01:14,831 --> 00:01:15,664
the phrase the Lions defeat the 
apostrophe s shows that the defeat 

27
00:01:19,151 --> 00:01:23,320
belongs to the lion and in English we 
also have pronouns that changed for form

28
00:01:23,321 --> 00:01:25,480
to show grammatical case.
For example,

29
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,490
I robbed her,
she robbed me,

30
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:32,260
I and she or the subject forms while me 
and her are the object forms,

31
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:33,273
but there are languages that show 
grammatical case much more than English 

32
00:01:35,441 --> 00:01:35,920
does.

33
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:38,920
The most common grammatical cases are 
probably nominative,

34
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:39,783
accusative and genitive.
Nominative case generally indicates the 

35
00:01:42,641 --> 00:01:43,474
subject of a sentence which often means 
the person or thing doing the action 

36
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:52,020
like this and Arabic acolyte walla due 
to fatten meaning the boy ate an apple.

37
00:01:52,390 --> 00:01:53,223
Here.
We can see that the word for boy 

38
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,073
[inaudible] has an e at the end because 
it is the subject of the sentence and 

39
00:01:58,661 --> 00:02:02,740
nominative case can also indicate the 
thing that the subject is equivalent to.

40
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:06,310
So in this sentence who are telling me 
soon hear the word for student.

41
00:02:06,370 --> 00:02:07,203
Tilimeers has wound at the end to 
indicate nominative case because it is 

42
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:13,900
equal to the subject.
This ending has the extra n sound at the

43
00:02:13,901 --> 00:02:14,734
end because it's indefinite.
These kinds of changes to the form of a 

44
00:02:17,741 --> 00:02:20,620
word to show grammatical difference are 
called inflections.

45
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:25,120
Accusative case generally indicates that
direct object of a verb in Arabic,

46
00:02:25,121 --> 00:02:27,070
it has that use along with some other 
uses.

47
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:27,993
For example,
[inaudible] which means I drink milk 

48
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:34,420
here,
the word for milk Halib has an ah at the

49
00:02:34,421 --> 00:02:38,350
end to indicate that it's the direct 
object or the accusative case.

50
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:39,453
Genitive case generally indicates that 
one noun is being modified by another 

51
00:02:42,671 --> 00:02:43,504
one often to show possession.
We dotty [inaudible] meaning the boys 

52
00:02:47,381 --> 00:02:48,214
teacher here.
The word for boy wallet has an e sound 

53
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:51,693
at the end to show possession.
Those are probably the three cases 

54
00:02:55,061 --> 00:02:57,820
you're most likely to run into,
but depending on the language,

55
00:02:57,821 --> 00:02:59,680
there are numerous other cases.
Well,

56
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:03,400
the date of case is generally used for a
noun which receives something.

57
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:04,263
Something moves towards that.
Now [inaudible] I didn't give the girl 

58
00:03:09,581 --> 00:03:13,420
money here.
The Latin word for girl who in La has an

59
00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:14,283
e at the end to indicate that she is the
indirect object on the receiving end of 

60
00:03:17,651 --> 00:03:18,484
an action.
Locative case is used to indicate a 

61
00:03:21,101 --> 00:03:21,934
location.

62
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:25,290
Here's an example from Turkish Fda Beer 
Kita aqua doom,

63
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:30,550
which means I read a book at home,
hear the word for HouseF has dead at the

64
00:03:30,551 --> 00:03:33,700
end to show that it's the location where
the reading took place.

65
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:35,043
In English,
we use a separate preposition like at 

66
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:39,940
[inaudible] or on to show location 
rather than a case inflection.

67
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:41,103
Instrumental case is used for announced 
that is used as a tool or a means of 

68
00:03:44,171 --> 00:03:45,004
completing an action.
Here's an example from Polish p shapew 

69
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:50,020
with them,
which means I write with a pen,

70
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:53,440
the word for pen people.
It all ends with the final,

71
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:54,303
Oh,
which has replaced by e m because it's 

72
00:03:56,411 --> 00:03:59,290
the instrument being used to carry out 
the action of writing.

73
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:00,543
Notice that because of that ending,
there was no need to add a standalone 

74
00:04:03,101 --> 00:04:03,934
preposition,
meaning with those are some of the most 

75
00:04:05,741 --> 00:04:06,574
common cases.
The main thing to keep in mind is that 

76
00:04:08,021 --> 00:04:12,010
the form of the now or of the Pronoun 
changes depending on its function in the

77
00:04:12,011 --> 00:04:12,844
sentence.

78
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:15,220
Sometimes cases apply not only to 
announce,

79
00:04:15,221 --> 00:04:18,850
but also to words that are connected to 
them like adjectives and articles.

80
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:22,060
Here's an example of an adjective being 
inflicted for case.

81
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:25,120
This time again in Arabic,
I'll have been to Al Jameela too,

82
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:26,133
which means the beautiful girl here,
the Noun for girl didn't has the 

83
00:04:29,681 --> 00:04:33,010
nominative case ending and so does the 
adjective Jameela,

84
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,113
but the Arabic equivalent of h at the 
end of the word changes to a t sound 

85
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:41,320
before the case nd.
And here's an example of articles taking

86
00:04:41,321 --> 00:04:43,600
case inflection.
This time from old English,

87
00:04:43,690 --> 00:04:45,220
say Kooning,
the king.

88
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:47,720
In nominative case,
in the genitive case,

89
00:04:47,721 --> 00:04:48,554
it's fast schooning gis salt.
The Noun is inflected with the genitive 

90
00:04:50,981 --> 00:04:51,814
ending.
And the definite article also has a 

91
00:04:53,081 --> 00:04:53,914
special form in the genitive case,
words have particular functions in all 

92
00:04:57,881 --> 00:04:58,714
languages of course,
but only in certain languages do they 

93
00:05:00,461 --> 00:05:01,294
commonly indicate these functions with 
changes to the form of the work when 

94
00:05:04,811 --> 00:05:06,190
talking about languages that do.

95
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:09,400
So we often talk about now in cases or 
case endings,

96
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:12,550
but remember that not only nouns can be 
inflicted for case,

97
00:05:12,551 --> 00:05:13,384
but also pronouns,
which represent nouns and also 

98
00:05:15,881 --> 00:05:19,450
adjectives which modify,
announce and articles which show whether

99
00:05:19,451 --> 00:05:20,284
nouns or definite or indefinite.
I hope that was a helpful summary for 

100
00:05:23,171 --> 00:05:26,740
anyone who needed clarification.
So the quick question of the day,

101
00:05:26,890 --> 00:05:27,723
do words in your language change form 
depending on their function in the 

102
00:05:30,341 --> 00:05:32,200
sentence.
If you can think of an example,

103
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:35,080
let us know in the comments down below.
Be sure to follow Lang,

104
00:05:35,081 --> 00:05:36,400
focus on facebook,
twitter,

105
00:05:36,401 --> 00:05:37,900
and instagram.
And once again,

106
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:38,763
thanks to all of my patrion supporters,
especially these extra special ones 

107
00:05:41,471 --> 00:05:42,304
right here for their monthly pledges.
Thank you for watching and have a nice 

108
00:05:45,910 --> 00:05:50,910
day.
Oh right.

109
00:05:57,461 --> 00:05:59,410
And a happy new year.
