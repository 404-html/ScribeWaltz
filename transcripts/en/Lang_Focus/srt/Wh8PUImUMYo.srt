1
00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:03,010
Whoa.

2
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:19,453
Hello everyone.
Welcome to the Lange Focus Channel and 

3
00:00:21,801 --> 00:00:22,634
my name is Paul.
Today's topic is the Hungarian language 

4
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:29,960
or my job and he has,
as it's called in Hungarian.

5
00:00:30,410 --> 00:00:33,500
Hungarian is not just another European 
language.

6
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:36,050
There's nothing else quite like it for 
starters,

7
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:36,913
it's not an Indo European language.
So when you look at a map and see that 

8
00:00:40,551 --> 00:00:44,960
Europe's Hungarian speaking areas are 
surrounded by Indo European languages,

9
00:00:44,990 --> 00:00:48,170
you have to ask yourself,
how did Hungarian get there?

10
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:51,710
Most Hungarian speakers live in the 
carpathian basin,

11
00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:54,440
bordered by the Carpathian mountains to 
the north,

12
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:58,100
east and south.
That includes not only around 10 million

13
00:00:58,101 --> 00:00:58,934
speakers in Hungary,
but also in areas of the basin in 

14
00:01:01,701 --> 00:01:03,980
neighboring countries,
including Romania,

15
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:05,690
Serbia,
Croatia,

16
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:07,610
Slovenia,
Austria,

17
00:01:07,730 --> 00:01:09,380
Slovakia,
and Ukraine.

18
00:01:09,650 --> 00:01:10,483
The largest Hungarian speaking minority 
is in northwestern and central Romania 

19
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:15,463
were around 1.2
million people speak at or around 6% of 

20
00:01:18,951 --> 00:01:20,180
the country's population.

21
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:23,510
All of these Hungarian areas in the car 
pay the invasives.

22
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:24,373
We're part of the Kingdom of Hungary 
until 1920 when many areas were seated 

23
00:01:28,221 --> 00:01:29,054
to other countries.
But how did they get there in the first 

24
00:01:31,041 --> 00:01:31,874
place?
Hungarian is a member of the eugric 

25
00:01:33,951 --> 00:01:34,784
branch of the urologic language family,
which originated in the vicinity of the 

26
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,033
Ural Mountains,
which separate Europe from western 

27
00:01:41,091 --> 00:01:41,924
Siberia.
The urologic languages include two main 

28
00:01:44,181 --> 00:01:45,950
groupings,
semiotic,

29
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:46,903
which was the first group to branch off 
from your Alec and Pheno eugric around 

30
00:01:50,571 --> 00:01:55,520
2000 bce or maybe earlier Finnell eugric
split into protal Eugric,

31
00:01:55,610 --> 00:01:58,730
the ancestor of the eugric branch,
and Prodo Finnick,

32
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:02,480
the ancestor of the Finnick languages,
including finish and Astonian.

33
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:03,583
Prodo eugric remained a unified language
for more than a millennium until 

34
00:02:06,891 --> 00:02:10,160
Hungarian diverged from it around 800 
bce.

35
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:13,430
There's some debate about whether the 
Hungarian ethnic group,

36
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:16,370
the man jars,
originated to the west or to the east of

37
00:02:16,371 --> 00:02:17,360
the euro mountains.

38
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:18,313
But at some point around 2000 years ago,
they became nomadic in response to 

39
00:02:21,711 --> 00:02:22,544
changes in climate and landscape,
and began gradually migrating towards 

40
00:02:25,701 --> 00:02:28,610
the West,
eventually reaching the Carpathian basin

41
00:02:28,611 --> 00:02:29,444
in the ninth century,
both while settled near the Ural 

42
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:34,330
Mountains and while migrating west,
the madge,

43
00:02:34,331 --> 00:02:37,100
ours had extensive contact with Turkic 
peoples.

44
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,113
For instance,
the my jars formed part of a tribal 

45
00:02:40,161 --> 00:02:44,390
alliance with Turkic tribes called on.
No good meaning 10 tribes,

46
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:46,880
which was based in the northern Black 
Sea area.

47
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:47,900
This,
by the way,

48
00:02:47,901 --> 00:02:52,610
is the most likely origin of the term 
Hungarian and it's equivalent Udon Gotti

49
00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:53,503
and Latin uhmm [inaudible] in Greek and 
own Goodie in Podo Slavic after the 

50
00:02:58,311 --> 00:03:02,340
owner Guler alliance disintegrated,
they became part of the cozaar connate,

51
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:03,413
a Turkic Empire covering much of the 
Caucasus region and the Black Sea area 

52
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:07,953
for a time.
They collected taxes from Slavic people 

53
00:03:09,941 --> 00:03:10,774
on behalf of the Kossar's until they 
became politically independent from the 

54
00:03:13,631 --> 00:03:14,464
Kossar's in the year eight 30 this 
interaction with Turkic tribes and 

55
00:03:17,741 --> 00:03:18,574
political entities led to significant 
Turkic influence on the Hungarian 

56
00:03:21,851 --> 00:03:22,684
language.

57
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:23,613
It's hard to give an exact count of the 
number of Turkic loan words in 

58
00:03:26,351 --> 00:03:27,184
Hungarian,
but this lexicon contains around 500 

59
00:03:29,651 --> 00:03:31,840
loan words from old Turkic.
Also,

60
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:35,590
the old Hungarian script developed from 
the [inaudible] script,

61
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:40,650
the Turkic runic script that was used by
the Kossar's in the ninth century.

62
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:41,643
The majora's.
We're carrying out frequent raids in 

63
00:03:43,421 --> 00:03:44,254
Europe and in the year 896 they crossed 
the Carpathian mountains under the 

64
00:03:48,101 --> 00:03:48,934
leadership of outer pod and began 
settling in the Carpathian basin by the 

65
00:03:53,231 --> 00:03:54,400
year 1000,
uh,

66
00:03:54,401 --> 00:03:57,370
Christian kingdom was established under 
King Stephen.

67
00:03:57,371 --> 00:04:01,990
The first under him Hungarian began to 
be written in the Latin Alphabet,

68
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:02,913
but for some time the old Hungarian 
script was used as well for vernacular 

69
00:04:06,461 --> 00:04:07,294
writing.
It was used by the [inaudible] until at 

70
00:04:09,851 --> 00:04:13,540
least the 17th century and since the 
early 20th century,

71
00:04:13,570 --> 00:04:18,100
it has undergone a revival to some 
extent with limited use for symbolic and

72
00:04:18,101 --> 00:04:19,150
cultural reasons.

73
00:04:19,330 --> 00:04:23,380
Stephen the first also med Latin,
the sole official language of Hungary.

74
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:25,810
And it remains so until the 19th 
century,

75
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:27,663
the old Hungarian period,
the old Hungarian period conventionally 

76
00:04:31,091 --> 00:04:33,850
begins with the settlement of the car 
pay the invasive.

77
00:04:34,210 --> 00:04:37,660
This is around the time of the earliest 
fragments of written Hungarian,

78
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:41,890
which date back to the 10th century and 
a written than the old Hungarian script.

79
00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:46,420
Isolated words written in the Latin 
alphabet can be found dating back to the

80
00:04:46,421 --> 00:04:47,254
mid 11th century.
And the oldest extensive texts is from 

81
00:04:50,711 --> 00:04:51,544
1192 the late 12th century.
Hungarian has changed relatively little 

82
00:04:55,901 --> 00:04:56,734
since the old Hungarian period,
but due to contact with other languages 

83
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:00,753
and the assimilation of other tribes,
it has absorbed words from a variety of 

84
00:05:04,301 --> 00:05:05,134
languages,
including German and the erotic and 

85
00:05:07,241 --> 00:05:08,074
Slavic languages as well as Latin and 
the Turkic languages we've already 

86
00:05:11,171 --> 00:05:13,390
discussed.
Middle Hungarian,

87
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:14,793
the Middle Hungarian period began with 
the printing of the first books in 

88
00:05:17,741 --> 00:05:18,574
Hungarian.

89
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:19,953
During much of this period,
the Ottoman occupation of central and 

90
00:05:22,571 --> 00:05:23,404
southern Hungary took place and the 
Habsburg empire ruled the northern and 

91
00:05:26,591 --> 00:05:27,424
northwestern areas,
which likely brought some additional 

92
00:05:29,381 --> 00:05:30,214
Turkic,
specifically Turkish and dramatic 

93
00:05:31,991 --> 00:05:34,930
influences to the language modern 
Hungarian.

94
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:39,580
In the 18th and 19th centuries,
Hungarian underwent a language reform in

95
00:05:39,581 --> 00:05:40,414
order to standardize it,
to make it more suitable for literature 

96
00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:44,920
and to make it more suitable for the 
sciences.

97
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:46,083
They revived old vocabulary,
used existing routes and fx station to 

98
00:05:49,481 --> 00:05:50,314
create new words and introduced some 
dialectal words on a national level in 

99
00:05:53,951 --> 00:05:54,784
order to expand the vocabulary.
In 1836 it became the official language 

100
00:05:59,150 --> 00:05:59,983
alongside Latin,
and in 1844 it became the sole official 

101
00:06:03,201 --> 00:06:08,180
language of Hungary.
From 1867 to 1918 the kingdom of Hungary

102
00:06:08,181 --> 00:06:10,430
was part of the Union of Austria,
Hungary.

103
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:11,743
In 1920 after Austria,
Hungary is involvement in the first 

104
00:06:14,421 --> 00:06:15,200
world war.

105
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,033
The treaty of Triano redrew the borders 
of Hungary and assigned many of its 

106
00:06:19,341 --> 00:06:20,174
areas to neighboring countries based on 
the ethnic composition of their 

107
00:06:23,001 --> 00:06:23,834
populations.
This resulted in the current situation 

108
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:27,013
in which millions of Hungarian speakers 
live outside of Hungary in neighboring 

109
00:06:30,111 --> 00:06:30,944
countries,
despite the fact that Hungarian has 

110
00:06:32,991 --> 00:06:36,140
ancient connections to other urologic 
languages today,

111
00:06:36,141 --> 00:06:39,110
it's similarities to them are not 
immediately obvious,

112
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:43,490
and despite the fact that Hungarian 
vocabulary has been widely influenced by

113
00:06:43,491 --> 00:06:44,324
other languages,
the borrowed words are mostly older 

114
00:06:46,551 --> 00:06:49,970
words that are further obscured through 
compounding and affixation.

115
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:52,490
For example,
the word Goomba,

116
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:53,533
meaning mushroom.
This was borrowed from old slavonic 

117
00:06:55,970 --> 00:06:57,860
Goomba.
In modern Bulgarian,

118
00:06:57,890 --> 00:07:01,640
it's Guba and in Super Mario brothers,
it's Goomba.

119
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:08,390
But this word can also form a compound 
word with this word here,

120
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:09,253
Sienna meaning species.
Goma Fayetta means fungus to make it 

121
00:07:13,161 --> 00:07:15,890
plural.
We add a k Goma ferric.

122
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:19,090
Then there might be a case ending gum 
buffet cat.

123
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:22,130
Now what's in the accusative case?
You may be thinking,

124
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:22,993
Hey,
that beginning part is still 

125
00:07:23,751 --> 00:07:26,330
recognizable to speakers of Bulgarian.
Yeah,

126
00:07:26,331 --> 00:07:28,580
maybe.
But in other Slavic languages,

127
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:29,473
that route is not so commonly used 
anymore or has changed more than it has 

128
00:07:32,631 --> 00:07:34,610
in Bulgarian.
Like in Slovak.

129
00:07:34,910 --> 00:07:35,743
It's who the main point I'm getting at 
is that a lot of the loan words in 

130
00:07:39,231 --> 00:07:41,570
Hungarian or not immediately 
recognizable,

131
00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:42,643
but anyway,
that brings us to the most important 

132
00:07:43,941 --> 00:07:45,500
question.
What's Hungarian?

133
00:07:45,501 --> 00:07:46,334
Like?
Hungarian is an a gluten native 

134
00:07:47,811 --> 00:07:48,644
language,
meaning that words are made up of a 

135
00:07:50,151 --> 00:07:50,984
linear sequence of morphemes that each 
contribute a piece of meaning to the 

136
00:07:54,081 --> 00:07:54,710
word.

137
00:07:54,710 --> 00:07:57,920
So let's start with this word.
Vital meaning city.

138
00:07:58,130 --> 00:08:00,830
For the plural,
we add oh vital,

139
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:04,100
she'll meaning cities and for words 
ending in a vowel,

140
00:08:04,101 --> 00:08:06,620
you just add.
For the first person,

141
00:08:06,621 --> 00:08:10,110
singular possessive.
We add boom of auto show,

142
00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:11,203
meaning my city.
Now let's make it a location of 

143
00:08:13,790 --> 00:08:16,730
[inaudible] means in my city.
This here,

144
00:08:16,731 --> 00:08:18,620
by the way,
it was the definite article,

145
00:08:18,710 --> 00:08:19,543
which we'll look at a little later.
So you can see how we start with the 

146
00:08:22,371 --> 00:08:25,130
root word and add suffixes to it to add 
meaning,

147
00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:28,010
but the suffixes are not always exactly 
the same.

148
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:32,150
For example,
Jeb meaning pocket for this word,

149
00:08:32,151 --> 00:08:32,984
the plural would be Jeff Beck.
My pocket [inaudible] my pockets in the 

150
00:08:37,521 --> 00:08:38,354
plural [inaudible] in my pocket.
[inaudible] them in my pockets or 

151
00:08:43,011 --> 00:08:43,910
champagne,
Ben.

152
00:08:44,570 --> 00:08:45,403
So what's up with all the ease instead 
of the oes and the a is we saw in the 

153
00:08:48,621 --> 00:08:49,760
first word,
well,

154
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:52,520
Hungarian features something called 
vowel harmony.

155
00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:53,683
This means that the vowels which appear 
and suffixes depend on the vowel in the 

156
00:08:56,821 --> 00:09:00,750
final syllable of the word.
So the suffix is in the first example.

157
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:03,630
Vitals are in harmony with the vowel.
Oh,

158
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:08,490
and the suffix is in the second example,
Jeb are in harmony with the vowel e.

159
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:12,090
The exact value used also depends on the
type of suffix.

160
00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:13,883
We can also see vowel harmony and a 
gluten nation in Hungarians verb 

161
00:09:16,951 --> 00:09:17,784
conjugations.
The base form of the verb meaning to 

162
00:09:19,951 --> 00:09:20,784
write is ead for regular verbs.
These verb endings here are added to 

163
00:09:24,871 --> 00:09:27,990
verbs with one of the following vowels 
in the final syllable.

164
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:32,730
The base form of the verb,
meaning to drive or to lead is visit.

165
00:09:33,090 --> 00:09:33,923
These verb endings here are added to 
verbs with one of the following vowels 

166
00:09:36,811 --> 00:09:40,080
in the final syllable,
either shorts he or long Ie.

167
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:45,470
The base form of the verb meaning to sit
is these endings right here are added to

168
00:09:45,751 --> 00:09:48,450
verbs with any of these vowels in the 
last syllable,

169
00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:49,523
but there's more.
These conjugations you see here are 

170
00:09:52,141 --> 00:09:53,820
indefinite conjugations.

171
00:09:55,890 --> 00:09:56,723
Transitive verbs in Hungarian have 
different conjugations depending on 

172
00:09:59,521 --> 00:10:02,160
whether the object is definite or 
indefinite.

173
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:03,413
Let's take the verb to write in.
Edo means I write or just eeoc because 

174
00:10:08,761 --> 00:10:09,594
Hungarian is pro drop,
meaning the subject pronouns can be 

175
00:10:12,151 --> 00:10:13,950
dropped.
Edo Call Amit,

176
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:15,053
I write something beat Oak Ridge.
Can you vet I write the book here we 

177
00:10:18,541 --> 00:10:23,541
have a direct object and edge is an 
indefinite article Util mcha and Yvette.

178
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:25,373
I write the book is a definite article 
and you dome is the definite 

179
00:10:29,761 --> 00:10:30,594
conjugation.
Hungarian verbs also have past tense 

180
00:10:33,631 --> 00:10:34,464
forms,
both definite and indefinite ones with 

181
00:10:37,201 --> 00:10:38,034
almost no exceptions.
There is no separate form for future 

182
00:10:40,471 --> 00:10:41,304
tense,
but the future can be expressed using 

183
00:10:43,321 --> 00:10:47,160
the infinitive of a verb plus the 
present tense of the verb folk knee.

184
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:48,383
So I will write a book is evening,
so we'll catch you Yvette and I will 

185
00:10:52,171 --> 00:10:54,980
write,
the book is [inaudible].

186
00:10:56,190 --> 00:10:59,700
There are also numerous prefixes which 
can be added to verbs,

187
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:00,653
some of which add a new shade of meaning
to the verb and others which completely 

188
00:11:03,691 --> 00:11:06,750
changed the meaning of the verb before 
we saw the verb,

189
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:11,280
which means to sit as in you are 
currently in a seated position.

190
00:11:11,430 --> 00:11:14,820
If you want to express the meaning of 
sit as in sit down,

191
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:19,850
you add the prefix net load and it can 
also mean to serve like in this phrase,

192
00:11:20,881 --> 00:11:25,881
meaning to serve a prison sentence.
[inaudible] to say sit up.

193
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:28,140
In other words,
to stop slouching.

194
00:11:28,170 --> 00:11:29,003
You say fed who bevel means sit in 
sometimes used for getting into a car 

195
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:39,180
and Lou means to sit still or to sit 
away from the prefix.

196
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:40,083
[inaudible] means away.
This word also means blow over or 

197
00:11:43,471 --> 00:11:47,130
subside.
And before we saw the verb visit,

198
00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:51,540
meaning drive or lead,
and it also means to conduct electricity

199
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:52,613
live as that means drive down like from 
a hill or from the capitol to the 

200
00:11:56,651 --> 00:11:57,484
countryside.

201
00:11:57,640 --> 00:12:02,200
But it also means deduce bev as it means
to drive into.

202
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:03,213
And it also means introduce,
in other words to put into practice fan 

203
00:12:06,821 --> 00:12:11,821
of as that means mislead or deceive.
And there are numerous more the way that

204
00:12:11,921 --> 00:12:12,754
these prefixes,
ultra or the meanings of words is not 

205
00:12:14,471 --> 00:12:17,470
always consistent.
So you can't always just put two and two

206
00:12:17,471 --> 00:12:19,270
together,
but sometimes that works.

207
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:20,823
There are also a couple of types of 
suffixes that can be attached to the 

208
00:12:23,171 --> 00:12:24,004
verb to change its meaning,
but at depending on vowel harmony or 

209
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:31,960
that that show causation.
For example,

210
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:32,853
visit means drive or lead visit.
That means make someone drive and after 

211
00:12:37,871 --> 00:12:40,220
that you can add verb endings to 
conjugate it,

212
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:41,223
like visit the drink.
We make someone drive and that's the 

213
00:12:44,801 --> 00:12:46,270
indefinite form.
By the way,

214
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:51,130
visit that Duke is the definite form 
visit that you Daniella as,

215
00:12:51,210 --> 00:12:54,670
oh this means we make Daniel drive the 
car.

216
00:12:55,090 --> 00:12:55,923
Leather is the instrumental case suffix,
which is used here to show who is being 

217
00:13:00,011 --> 00:13:00,844
caused to do something.
It's basic forms are evolve and vel 

218
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:05,343
depending on vowel harmony.
But when attached to announce ending in 

219
00:13:08,321 --> 00:13:11,770
a consonant,
The v assimilates to the final consonant

220
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:13,420
resulting in germination,
uh,

221
00:13:13,421 --> 00:13:14,254
doubled.
Consonant Oz is the definite article 

222
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:21,160
before we saw the form awe,
but when the noun begins with a vowel,

223
00:13:21,190 --> 00:13:22,023
then the form Oz is used.
The term at the end of our tote is the 

224
00:13:25,931 --> 00:13:26,764
accusative case ending,
which is used to indicate the direct 

225
00:13:29,201 --> 00:13:34,201
object cases.
One of the most notorious aspects of the

226
00:13:34,331 --> 00:13:38,350
Hungarian language is it system of cases
which are attached to nouns.

227
00:13:38,530 --> 00:13:42,100
There are 18 cases though.
Some people will say there are more.

228
00:13:42,430 --> 00:13:44,920
Look at these tables for the noun 
meaning car.

229
00:13:45,310 --> 00:13:47,470
This looks pretty intimidating.
However,

230
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:51,550
most of these case endings function in a
similar way to prepositions in English,

231
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:53,380
except that they are after the word.

232
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,660
In other words,
they're like post positions.

233
00:13:55,870 --> 00:13:57,570
Take the date of case form.
Oh,

234
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,920
don't fuck.
This means to the car.

235
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:02,020
The instrumental case,
oh,

236
00:14:02,021 --> 00:14:05,710
dovall would mean by car the terminated 
case.

237
00:14:05,890 --> 00:14:09,520
Oh de League would mean something like 
as far as the car.

238
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:10,473
For example,
if you were going to walk until you 

239
00:14:12,011 --> 00:14:14,470
reached the car,
the ines IV case,

240
00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:18,610
oh bum would mean in the car,
the ablative case,

241
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:22,120
outdoor coil would mean away from the 
car and so on.

242
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:26,590
So thinking of them as post positions 
rather than case endings might make it a

243
00:14:26,591 --> 00:14:27,424
little less intimidating.
And it may look like there are separate 

244
00:14:30,191 --> 00:14:32,710
forms for plural nouns,
but the really aren't.

245
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:33,813
The plural forms simply have the plural 
suffix [inaudible] and then the case 

246
00:14:36,731 --> 00:14:37,564
endings are added after that.
The only tweak to that is the double 

247
00:14:40,631 --> 00:14:43,420
consonant in the instrumental case that 
we saw before,

248
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:46,930
as well as in another case called the 
translative case.

249
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:50,770
Unlike in many other languages,
cases only affect nouns,

250
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:54,770
not adjectives or articles.
In addition to cases,

251
00:14:54,771 --> 00:14:55,604
there are also possessive suffixes and 
these can be used together with various 

252
00:14:59,001 --> 00:15:01,970
case endings.
Oh Dome my car.

253
00:15:02,210 --> 00:15:03,043
And to express this fully,
we need to use the definite article 

254
00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:07,063
[inaudible] I am in my car as oh towed 
your car and she shit cause I'm walking 

255
00:15:15,201 --> 00:15:20,200
away from your car.
Or maybe it would be as [inaudible].

256
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:24,410
I'm walking away from your car with the 
emphasis on your car.

257
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:27,230
Hungarian word order is not set in 
stone.

258
00:15:27,290 --> 00:15:30,350
When something appears before the verb,
it is emphasized,

259
00:15:30,410 --> 00:15:34,040
so by moving the Noun to the beginning,
we are placing emphasis on it.

260
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:35,113
The verb prefix or pre verb l meaning 
away also moves out of the way when 

261
00:15:39,111 --> 00:15:42,200
something else is placed in front of the
verb to emphasize it,

262
00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:43,183
it's like the main verb is handing the 
emphasis over to whatever comes before 

263
00:15:46,611 --> 00:15:48,710
it,
but if there's a pre verb in the way,

264
00:15:48,770 --> 00:15:52,940
the main verb can't pass the emphasis,
but if the pre verb gets out of the way,

265
00:15:52,970 --> 00:15:56,120
then there's nothing blocking the 
emphasis from being handed over.

266
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:59,510
Since these pre verbs can be split from 
the main verb,

267
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:00,373
they can be referred to as co verbs.
Let's add an adverb to this sentence as 

268
00:16:05,010 --> 00:16:06,760
shit [inaudible].

269
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:12,460
This means I'm walking slowly away from 
your car with no particular emphasis now

270
00:16:13,170 --> 00:16:15,370
loves sean shade.
That'll cause a toto.

271
00:16:15,830 --> 00:16:16,663
This means I'm walking slowly away from 
your car with the emphasis on slowly 

272
00:16:21,890 --> 00:16:22,723
when there's an explicit subject placing
it before the verb places emphasis on 

273
00:16:26,661 --> 00:16:28,300
it.
If there's no pre bourbon,

274
00:16:28,310 --> 00:16:33,310
the way Michael [inaudible],
Michael is walking slowly away from your

275
00:16:33,951 --> 00:16:34,784
car.
This sentence has no particular 

276
00:16:36,171 --> 00:16:37,004
emphasis,
but let's get the pre verb out of the 

277
00:16:38,691 --> 00:16:41,240
way.
My good shape that allison has,

278
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:44,570
oh,
toto Michael is walking slowly away from

279
00:16:44,571 --> 00:16:45,404
your car here.
The emphasis is on Michael because it 

280
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:48,704
comes right before the verb.
My coolest [inaudible] Michael is 

281
00:16:53,211 --> 00:16:55,760
walking slowly away from your car.
Again,

282
00:16:55,761 --> 00:17:00,761
the emphasis here is on La Shaunn slowly
because it comes right before the verb.

283
00:17:01,070 --> 00:17:01,903
This position right before the verb is 
the most emphatic if the verb comes at 

284
00:17:06,141 --> 00:17:09,860
the beginning before an explicit subject
than the verbus emphasized,

285
00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:13,040
but for this sentence,
the meaning wouldn't really make sense.

286
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:15,193
A couple of notes on Hungarian phonology
and orthography in terms of phonology 

287
00:17:19,281 --> 00:17:20,114
and orthography Hungarians,
not exactly the simplest language out 

288
00:17:22,881 --> 00:17:24,920
there.
There are 14 vowels.

289
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:25,813
This includes seven pairs of short and 
long equivalent with the acute accents 

290
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:30,583
indicating long vowels.
One of the immediately noticeable 

291
00:17:32,991 --> 00:17:33,824
features is the double acute accent to 
show the long equivalents of the vowels 

292
00:17:37,251 --> 00:17:41,270
with uhmm louts.
There are also 30 consonants for a total

293
00:17:41,271 --> 00:17:42,104
of 44 letters in the Hungarian alphabet,
but some of the consonants consist of 

294
00:17:45,981 --> 00:17:49,500
two or three orthographic letters.
These consonants with Y,

295
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:52,560
our palatalized consonants,
and there are these others.

296
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:55,100
See s equals chuck,
D,

297
00:17:55,230 --> 00:17:56,950
Z,
s equals j,

298
00:17:56,970 --> 00:17:57,691
e,
s,

299
00:17:57,691 --> 00:18:01,230
z equals C and Z,
s equals g.

300
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:02,693
In addition to palatalized consonants,
another common phonological and 

301
00:18:05,821 --> 00:18:06,654
orthographic feature is germination 
lengthened consonants that are 

302
00:18:09,571 --> 00:18:11,970
represented by double consonants in 
writing.

303
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,990
If you see a sentence that contains 
double consonants,

304
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:19,290
consonants followed by Y and multiple 
acute accents,

305
00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:21,450
Uhmm,
louts or a double a cute accent,

306
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,910
then you're almost certainly looking at 
Hungarian.

307
00:18:24,510 --> 00:18:27,720
Let's look at one final sentence in 
Hungarian and break it down.

308
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:29,300
Now,
everybodyokay Hash,

309
00:18:29,310 --> 00:18:31,530
mathematic ab,
that damage cabbies album.

310
00:18:31,830 --> 00:18:32,663
The sentence means I'm not hungry 
because I already ate lunch at a cafe 

311
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,710
word for word.
It's no,

312
00:18:37,770 --> 00:18:41,600
I am hungry because already I have 
lunch,

313
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:46,260
a cafe in first we see the negation word
Nem.

314
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:47,273
This word doesn't change and you just 
put it before the part of the sentence 

315
00:18:50,041 --> 00:18:50,874
that you want to make negative.
There are other forms of negotiation as 

316
00:18:53,611 --> 00:18:54,444
well,
but this is the basic way in indicative 

317
00:18:56,101 --> 00:18:56,934
sentences.
Next we see video which means I am this 

318
00:19:00,511 --> 00:19:01,344
ending.
Oh is a typical present tense ending 

319
00:19:03,721 --> 00:19:07,650
meaning I with its vowel harmonizing 
with this a vowel awe.

320
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:10,980
But this verb is a rather special one in
irregular verb.

321
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:14,910
Removing oak would give you the third 
person singular present tense form.

322
00:19:14,970 --> 00:19:15,803
But for this verb,
[inaudible] is the second person 

323
00:19:17,941 --> 00:19:20,940
singular and the third person singular 
is Vaughn.

324
00:19:21,510 --> 00:19:22,343
It also has a different past tense stem 
voight and it's also the only Hungarian 

325
00:19:27,121 --> 00:19:29,790
verb with its own inflected.
Future tense form.

326
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:33,660
Other verbs express the future using two
verbs like we saw before.

327
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:40,200
A Hash is the word for hungry.
The singular form of this word is always

328
00:19:40,201 --> 00:19:44,550
the same and has never inflected for 
gender or case and be that,

329
00:19:44,610 --> 00:19:45,443
um,
is the first person singular past tense 

330
00:19:47,430 --> 00:19:48,263
of the verb,
meaning to have lunch and the identity 

331
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:51,323
which has the base form and Ba da them 
is the first person singular past tense 

332
00:19:55,891 --> 00:19:59,220
inflection and vowel harmony determines 
that it's dumb.

333
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:02,520
Not Dumb.
This is the indefinite conjugation.

334
00:20:02,550 --> 00:20:04,980
But for the first person singular past 
tense,

335
00:20:05,010 --> 00:20:10,010
the definite and indefinite forms are 
actually the same edge is the indefinite

336
00:20:10,351 --> 00:20:11,184
article.
Got Album is the word for cafe with the 

337
00:20:14,370 --> 00:20:16,890
NSF case ending bond.
In other words,

338
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:17,753
it's like a post position meaning him,
and it's worth noting that this ending 

339
00:20:21,271 --> 00:20:23,040
is bond,
not Ben,

340
00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:25,110
because it's in harmony with the,
Oh,

341
00:20:25,111 --> 00:20:28,950
at the end of Kava is old.
As you can probably see,

342
00:20:28,951 --> 00:20:29,784
Hungarian is quite different from any 
Indo European language and it's 

343
00:20:32,521 --> 00:20:33,990
different from any other language.

344
00:20:33,990 --> 00:20:34,823
In Europe.
It's a gluten native grammar and it's 

345
00:20:36,481 --> 00:20:40,680
now in cases which functions somewhat 
like post positions are somewhat similar

346
00:20:40,681 --> 00:20:41,514
to other pheno eugric languages,
but there are also differences and it 

347
00:20:44,611 --> 00:20:48,190
contains much less Finnell eugric 
vocabulary than you might expect.

348
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,233
But despite being different,
Hungarian is really not as complicated 

349
00:20:52,061 --> 00:20:52,894
as people make it out to beat.
The noun cases aren't that hard to wrap 

350
00:20:55,601 --> 00:20:56,434
your head around.
If you think of them like post 

351
00:20:57,611 --> 00:20:58,444
positions,
vowel harmony isn't that hard to get 

352
00:21:00,341 --> 00:21:01,174
used to because there are a limited 
number of variations and indefinite and 

353
00:21:04,871 --> 00:21:07,210
definite conjugations work very 
logically.

354
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:08,980
It just takes some time to get used to 
them.

355
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:11,680
And other aspects of Hungarian are quite
simple.

356
00:21:11,710 --> 00:21:14,740
For example,
there's no grammatical gender at all and

357
00:21:14,770 --> 00:21:15,603
adjectives and articles are not 
inflected for case which makes dealing 

358
00:21:18,431 --> 00:21:19,264
with the cases much simpler.
The main point I'm getting at is that 

359
00:21:21,881 --> 00:21:23,860
after digging into Hungarian a little 
bit,

360
00:21:23,861 --> 00:21:25,900
just enough to make this language 
profile,

361
00:21:25,930 --> 00:21:26,763
I've come away with the impression that 
it's not as complicated as I had been 

362
00:21:29,681 --> 00:21:30,580
led to believe.

363
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:31,623
So if you're interested in the Hungarian
people or the Hungarian culture or the 

364
00:21:34,481 --> 00:21:35,314
country of Hungary,
then don't be scared to start learning 

365
00:21:37,271 --> 00:21:38,104
the Hungarian language as well.
The question of the day to native 

366
00:21:40,841 --> 00:21:41,674
speakers of Hungarian,
what language or languages do you think 

367
00:21:44,201 --> 00:21:47,950
share the most similarities with 
Hungarian and to learners of Hungarian?

368
00:21:48,130 --> 00:21:51,670
What aspects of the language have you 
found most challenging and what has been

369
00:21:51,671 --> 00:21:54,070
more straight forward?
Be sure to follow Lang,

370
00:21:54,071 --> 00:21:55,930
focus on facebook,
twitter,

371
00:21:55,931 --> 00:21:57,730
and instagram.
And once again,

372
00:21:57,850 --> 00:21:59,830
thank you to all of my patrion 
supporters,

373
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:02,500
especially the amazing ones right here 
on the screen.

374
00:22:02,530 --> 00:22:03,363
Who are my top tier patrons?
So many thanks to them as always and to 

375
00:22:06,521 --> 00:22:07,354
everyone else.
Thank you for watching and have a nice 

376
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:11,193
day.
