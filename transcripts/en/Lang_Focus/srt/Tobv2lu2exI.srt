00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:13,473
Hello everyone.
Welcome to the Lange Focus Channel and 

2
00:00:15,550 --> 00:00:19,030
my name is Paul.
Today we're going to focus on a language

3
00:00:19,031 --> 00:00:19,864
called Katelyn.
Katelyn is a member of the Occidental 

4
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:25,120
Romance Branch of the Romance Language 
family.

5
00:00:25,510 --> 00:00:26,343
It's mainly spoken in and around 
Catalonia and autonomous community in 

6
00:00:29,771 --> 00:00:32,740
spin as well as in another autonomous 
community,

7
00:00:32,890 --> 00:00:33,723
the Balearic islands,
and also in the autonomous community of 

8
00:00:36,731 --> 00:00:37,564
Valencia.
But some people will definitely dispute 

9
00:00:39,851 --> 00:00:40,684
that many members of the Valencian 
community will insist that they speak a 

10
00:00:44,141 --> 00:00:46,900
separate language called Valencia and 
others,

11
00:00:46,930 --> 00:00:47,763
including most linguists,
simply considered Valencian to be a 

12
00:00:50,291 --> 00:00:52,210
collection of cattle and dialects.

13
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:55,613
Amanda,

14
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:00,550
um,
okay,

15
00:01:00,551 --> 00:01:03,460
let's leave that issue aside for now.
But in any case,

16
00:01:03,490 --> 00:01:04,323
in all three of those autonomous 
communities cancel on his co official 

17
00:01:07,391 --> 00:01:08,224
with Spanish,
except in Valencia where it's co 

18
00:01:10,521 --> 00:01:13,270
official,
a Spanish under the name Valencian.

19
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,790
Oh Man.
This video just started and I've already

20
00:01:15,791 --> 00:01:16,624
got a headache.
Cattle land has also spoken in the tiny 

21
00:01:18,701 --> 00:01:19,534
principality of Endora,
which is located in the Pyrenees 

22
00:01:22,061 --> 00:01:25,960
mountains and is bordered by France to 
the north and Spain to the self.

23
00:01:26,350 --> 00:01:29,230
Kendall land has also spoken across the 
border in France,

24
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:30,093
in the northern Catalonia region.
Cattle land is closely related to 

25
00:01:32,891 --> 00:01:33,724
Oxytocin,
which is spoken in areas of France 

26
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:38,440
adjacent to northern Catalonia.
In the past,

27
00:01:38,470 --> 00:01:42,760
Katelyn and oxidant were considered to 
be dialect groups of the same language,

28
00:01:42,910 --> 00:01:45,370
but they're now widely considered to be 
independent.

29
00:01:45,371 --> 00:01:48,370
Sister languages have the same 
Occidental Romance branch.

30
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:52,300
Katelyn has also spoken in the town of 
[inaudible] ghetto in Sardinia,

31
00:01:52,330 --> 00:01:53,020
Italy.

32
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:55,390
Katelyn is spoken by over 10 million 
people,

33
00:01:55,450 --> 00:01:56,283
some of whom indisputable.
He speak it as a native language and 

34
00:01:58,631 --> 00:02:00,670
some of whom speak another language at 
home,

35
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:01,533
usually Spanish,
but are also fluent in cattle land and 

36
00:02:03,581 --> 00:02:06,190
speak at at a native level because of 
their environment.

37
00:02:06,490 --> 00:02:09,880
It's the sixth most spoken romance 
language after Spanish,

38
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:11,200
Portuguese,
French,

39
00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:12,580
Italian,
and Romanian.

40
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,270
It's also the most spoken nonstate 
language in Europe,

41
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:18,400
meaning that it's the most spoken 
language.

42
00:02:18,401 --> 00:02:21,010
That's not an official language at the 
national level.

43
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:24,160
That's because it's not official at the 
national level in Spain,

44
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:27,730
even though millions of people speak it,
it's only official in endora.

45
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:28,893
Some people want it to be the official 
language of a new country called 

46
00:02:31,361 --> 00:02:33,670
Catalonia that would be separate from 
Spain.

47
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:38,633
Tell you what,
you can just google it and history like 

48
00:02:40,921 --> 00:02:41,754
all romance languages.
Katelyn developed from dialects of 

49
00:02:44,191 --> 00:02:48,030
vulgar Latin in areas that had been 
under the control of the Roman Empire.

50
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:50,670
The earliest form of oxytocin or 
romance,

51
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:51,553
no one has old oxy 10 or old provence 
owl had developed by the eighth century 

52
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:59,470
and later some of its varieties began to
diverge into old Katelyn.

53
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:03,160
Between the 10th and 14th centuries.
In the 12th century,

54
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:05,000
the county of Barcelona,
I can't,

55
00:03:05,001 --> 00:03:08,620
Deland County formed a dynastic union 
with the Kingdom of Aragon,

56
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:13,680
forming the crown of our goal and other 
Catalan counties formed the Principality

57
00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:17,020
of Catalonia together with Barcelona,
bringing them into the crown.

58
00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:20,800
The crown of our gone expanded under the
rule of James the conqueror,

59
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:24,760
who brought Valencia and the Balearic 
islands under the crown's control,

60
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:25,683
and these became Catalan speaking areas.
The political capital of the crown of 

61
00:03:28,901 --> 00:03:32,560
our goal was the city of Zaragoza in the
Kingdom of are gone,

62
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:33,573
but the defacto economic and cultural 
centers where Barcelona and Valencia 

63
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:39,010
both Kavalan speaking cities.

64
00:03:39,850 --> 00:03:40,683
By the 14th and 15th centuries,
the crown of Aragona had greatly 

65
00:03:43,721 --> 00:03:46,300
expanded to include Corsica,
Sardinia,

66
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,650
Sicily,
and Naples.

67
00:03:48,010 --> 00:03:50,500
And for a brief time,
Athens and Nail Patras.

68
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:54,160
In present day Greece,
there was a large cancel land commercial

69
00:03:54,161 --> 00:03:54,994
presence throughout the Mediterranean 
region and the Catalan language became 

70
00:03:57,971 --> 00:04:00,670
widespread,
at least amongst the commercial class.

71
00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:03,580
Catelynn was considered one of the great
languages of Europe.

72
00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:04,623
But in 1479 the crown of Aragon formed a
union with the crown of Casteel and 

73
00:04:09,071 --> 00:04:12,520
Castilian today also known as just the 
Spanish or espanol,

74
00:04:12,610 --> 00:04:16,570
began to grow in influence and cancel 
and began to decline an influence.

75
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:20,890
During much of the period from the 16th 
century to the 20th century,

76
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:21,753
various laws were enacted that limited 
the use of cattle and in official 

77
00:04:24,881 --> 00:04:28,510
documents and publications in 
administration and in schools.

78
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:32,590
But since 1975 it has been made co 
official in Catalonia,

79
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:33,453
Valencia and the belly,
Eric Islands and in Catalonia schools 

80
00:04:36,281 --> 00:04:39,160
are now required to teach most subjects 
in Catalan.

81
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,113
In Valencia,
there's less instruction and catelynn 

82
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:44,140
known officially there as Valencian by 
the way,

83
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:47,830
but there are current government efforts
to increase it in the belly.

84
00:04:47,831 --> 00:04:48,664
Eric Islands,
at least 50% of the students schooling 

85
00:04:51,010 --> 00:04:51,843
must be conducted in Katelyn.
Though there are also programs that are 

86
00:04:54,341 --> 00:04:55,174
taught entirely in Katelyn,
all of the cattle land speaking 

87
00:04:57,431 --> 00:05:01,900
autonomous areas of Spain or bilingual 
with Catalan speakers also being Spanish

88
00:05:01,901 --> 00:05:04,690
speakers.
So what's Catalan like?

89
00:05:05,290 --> 00:05:06,123
Once you learn one romance language,
you've already taken a great step 

90
00:05:08,771 --> 00:05:09,604
towards understanding the others.
If we look at a list of basic greetings 

91
00:05:12,761 --> 00:05:15,070
and capsule,
then there will definitely be some words

92
00:05:15,071 --> 00:05:18,520
that speakers of other romance languages
will recognize immediately.

93
00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:21,020
Good morning or good day on the,
ah,

94
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:23,500
that sounds an awful lot like 
Portuguese,

95
00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:25,480
Bom,
Dia and Spanish.

96
00:05:25,570 --> 00:05:26,403
Buenos Dias.
Good afternoon [inaudible] compare that 

97
00:05:29,831 --> 00:05:34,360
with Portuguese and Spanish.
When I started this.

98
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:36,430
Good evening or good night.

99
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:37,433
Bye [inaudible] compare that with 
Portuguese were annoyed that in Spanish 

100
00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:42,303
when us no chess and an Italian good 
night would be worn or not dare to say 

101
00:05:46,661 --> 00:05:50,590
by you might say or they'll compare that
to Portuguese.

102
00:05:50,770 --> 00:05:51,603
Are they all Spanish and French?
Add you and if you want to be more 

103
00:05:56,531 --> 00:06:01,531
formal you might say,
compare that with French oak of Wa.

104
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:03,223
Now let's look at some cattle and 
sentences and examine some of the 

105
00:06:05,481 --> 00:06:07,160
languages.
Basic features,

106
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:08,083
many of which are quite similar to other
romance languages but with some 

107
00:06:10,701 --> 00:06:13,330
differences of course of Zeb is in 
bumper fussell.

108
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,190
This means Joseph is a good teacher.
Oh,

109
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:18,770
Giussep is in bumper.
Fussell word for word.

110
00:06:18,771 --> 00:06:23,771
It's the Joseph is a good teacher.
This sentence follows basically the same

111
00:06:24,291 --> 00:06:25,124
word order you would find in other 
romance languages and an English with 

112
00:06:27,801 --> 00:06:30,960
one difference.
The definite article all before the name

113
00:06:30,970 --> 00:06:31,803
Joseph in Catalan,
a definite article is used before 

114
00:06:34,401 --> 00:06:37,490
people's first names and this is called 
the personal article.

115
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:39,710
We'll come back to definite articles in 
a minute.

116
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:42,290
This whole sentence is masculine,
singular,

117
00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:44,840
like other romance languages,
cantillon nouns,

118
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:47,690
articles and adjectives are inflected 
for grammatical,

119
00:06:47,691 --> 00:06:48,524
gender and number.
Let's look at a similar feminine 

120
00:06:50,421 --> 00:06:52,760
sentence.
Laser Velez and I want to prefer Sota.

121
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:56,720
Isabel is a good teacher,
let of is and I want to prefer soda.

122
00:06:57,260 --> 00:06:58,093
Feminine nouns generally and in a and 
the adjectives that modify them are 

123
00:07:01,491 --> 00:07:03,950
inflected with a feminine ending a as 
well.

124
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:08,120
While masculine nouns generally end in a
consonant or an o or I.

125
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:10,093
One other thing I want to point out here
is that the letter R is silent in the 

126
00:07:13,101 --> 00:07:17,060
final position in Katelyn,
so this word professoral ends in a vowel

127
00:07:17,061 --> 00:07:17,894
sound.
There are basically four definite 

128
00:07:20,571 --> 00:07:23,570
articles.
The singular forms are all and la,

129
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:26,060
which changed to look with an 
apostrophe.

130
00:07:26,090 --> 00:07:29,030
If the following word starts with a 
vowel or an h,

131
00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:33,110
the plural forms are us and less for the
personal article.

132
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:33,973
There are the alternate forms and not 
with an apostrophe before a vowel or an 

133
00:07:38,391 --> 00:07:39,224
h.
The indefinite articles are we not 

134
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:43,003
wounds and Eunice,
the way articles work in Catelynn is 

135
00:07:45,831 --> 00:07:49,400
similar to another romance languages,
but the forms are different of course,

136
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:52,880
and there are also some dialectal 
differences in Catalan articles.

137
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:55,870
Another sentence it yes,
and but of the animals.

138
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:56,713
Dot.
This means she always has lunch very 

139
00:07:58,581 --> 00:08:01,460
late,
a simpler the animal dot word for word,

140
00:08:01,461 --> 00:08:05,150
it's,
she always has lunch very late.

141
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,193
One thing I'd like to point out right 
off the bat is this phrase molded in 

142
00:08:09,681 --> 00:08:11,450
Spanish.
It would be week dot.

143
00:08:11,451 --> 00:08:14,450
A day in Portuguese it would be winter 
[inaudible].

144
00:08:14,570 --> 00:08:18,620
In Italian it would be [inaudible] quite
similar to the candyland phrase,

145
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:22,040
but in the other languages,
words tend to end in vowels,

146
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:22,933
especially in Italian.
Words end in consonants much more often 

147
00:08:25,521 --> 00:08:26,354
than Katelyn,
but also pay attention to the 

148
00:08:28,101 --> 00:08:28,730
continents.

149
00:08:28,730 --> 00:08:29,563
At the end of these words.
Here we see the simplification of final 

150
00:08:32,391 --> 00:08:33,224
consonant clusters.
T is often not pronounced after another 

151
00:08:36,231 --> 00:08:40,670
consonant at the end of a word,
especially in the combinations of Lt,

152
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:43,010
rt,
nt and St.

153
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:44,023
Sometimes it may be pronounced slightly 
or articulated but not released and in 

154
00:08:48,141 --> 00:08:48,974
final position,
the letter d is pronounced as to but 

155
00:08:51,921 --> 00:08:56,400
similar to t it's often silent or 
unreleased after another consonant.

156
00:08:56,610 --> 00:08:57,443
Simplification of final consonant 
clusters is a prominent feature of 

157
00:09:00,391 --> 00:09:01,224
Cadillac,
but it does not always happen and it 

158
00:09:02,941 --> 00:09:03,774
varies depending on the dialect.
The speaker in the samples speaks a 

159
00:09:06,751 --> 00:09:07,584
central Catalan dialect.
Here we have a personal pronoun as the 

160
00:09:11,281 --> 00:09:14,160
subject of the sentence.
This is actually not necessary.

161
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:18,240
Cantillon is a pro dropped language,
meaning that the subject pronouns can be

162
00:09:18,241 --> 00:09:19,074
dropped because person a number are 
clear from the verb conjugation like 

163
00:09:22,801 --> 00:09:23,950
other romance languages.

164
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:26,490
Katelyn has two types of personal 
pronouns,

165
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:27,353
strong pronouns,
which are used as subject pronouns and 

166
00:09:29,791 --> 00:09:30,624
after prepositions.
The only difference being in the first 

167
00:09:32,581 --> 00:09:34,980
person singular and there are weak 
pronouns,

168
00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:38,610
which are clinics that are used for the 
direct or indirect object.

169
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:42,780
Cattle then has more weak pronoun forums
than other major romance languages.

170
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:44,693
Just a note about this word [inaudible] 
in this sentence it's pronounced as the 

171
00:09:47,791 --> 00:09:51,120
na because in Catalan d is pronounced as
the soft,

172
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:52,013
the sound between vowels.
Even though the D is in the initial 

173
00:09:54,811 --> 00:09:55,644
position here it is affected by the 
vowel at the end of the previous word 

174
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:00,823
did not is irregular verb meaning to 
have lunch and here it's conjugated in 

175
00:10:04,261 --> 00:10:06,660
the third person singular for the 
present tense.

176
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,073
Katelyn has three categories of regular 
verbs which are characterized by 

177
00:10:11,131 --> 00:10:13,680
different endings.
Verb ending in Ar,

178
00:10:13,770 --> 00:10:18,120
also known as the first conjugation verb
ending in our e or er,

179
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:21,150
the second conjugation and verbs ending 
in irr.

180
00:10:21,210 --> 00:10:22,043
The third conjugation verbs in each 
category have the same or similar 

181
00:10:25,321 --> 00:10:28,020
conjugations.
Another sentence,

182
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:32,040
mother nothin's [inaudible] this means 
he gave me the money this morning,

183
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:33,143
mother,
not those dienes I couldn't Mati word 

184
00:10:34,681 --> 00:10:35,514
for word.
It's to me has given the masculine 

185
00:10:38,041 --> 00:10:42,510
plural money this morning.
The first word ma is a week Pronoun,

186
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:44,730
which is used for the indirect object 
here.

187
00:10:45,030 --> 00:10:45,863
This form of the Pronoun m apostrophe 
comes before vowels and the letter h 

188
00:10:49,590 --> 00:10:52,650
while before consonants.
It's m as in m.

189
00:10:53,070 --> 00:10:53,903
Notice that it comes before the verb.
Other not is the perfect form of the 

190
00:10:56,941 --> 00:11:01,941
verb do na the perfect form includes the
auxiliary verb of a followed by the past

191
00:11:02,101 --> 00:11:02,934
participle.
It's used for events in the recent past 

192
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:10,230
and events within timeframes that are 
connected to now like this month or this

193
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:11,063
year.
There are parallel tenses in other 

194
00:11:12,031 --> 00:11:12,864
romance languages and cattle and system 
of verb tenses in general is very 

195
00:11:16,051 --> 00:11:17,790
similar to other romance languages.

196
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:19,253
Do not is another example of a Catalan 
word ending in a continent where it 

197
00:11:22,801 --> 00:11:25,170
would end with a vowel in other romance 
languages.

198
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:26,093
In Italian,
this would be a little bottle and in 

199
00:11:27,551 --> 00:11:30,210
Spanish it would be the model in 
Romanian,

200
00:11:30,211 --> 00:11:32,460
however it would be donut.
Next,

201
00:11:32,490 --> 00:11:36,270
notice the masculine plural definite 
article because the word for money,

202
00:11:36,330 --> 00:11:37,163
dns is plural.
The word a kid is similar to Italian 

203
00:11:41,371 --> 00:11:42,204
Cuesta or Spanish and Portuguese Esta,
but notice that the s and t are 

204
00:11:45,931 --> 00:11:46,764
pronounced differently.
The S is silent in the tea is not 

205
00:11:49,201 --> 00:11:50,034
released.
Mati is similar to Italian Martina or 

206
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:53,853
French natal.
Coming back to the week pronouns for a 

207
00:11:56,471 --> 00:11:57,304
minute.
What if we want to use a pronoun in 

208
00:11:58,781 --> 00:11:59,614
place of [inaudible]?
Whether or not that can mati the direct 

209
00:12:02,981 --> 00:12:04,720
object in this case,
oh,

210
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:08,680
meaning it must come after the indirect 
object week.

211
00:12:08,681 --> 00:12:10,210
Pronouns come after the verb.

212
00:12:10,210 --> 00:12:13,450
In the case of imperatives,
at least positive imperatives,

213
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:17,350
jurrens and infinitives,
so the imperative sentence give it to me

214
00:12:17,410 --> 00:12:22,080
would be gona move another sentence.
It is about going to the AFI.

215
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:25,330
Those ans this means he graduated two 
years ago.

216
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:27,580
Word for word.
It's reflexive Pronoun.

217
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:30,430
He graduated,
makes two years.

218
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:34,030
Remember that the subject Pronoun l is 
probably not necessary.

219
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:36,430
Let's look at the end of the sentence 
first.

220
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:37,383
This phrase here,
Father's ons shows the use of the verb 

221
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:44,290
fe meaning to make to tell how much time
has passed since then event happened.

222
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:46,990
This is similar to how it would be 
expressed in Italian.

223
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:52,080
Do a on the far as about a lot of the 
work is a past tense construction called

224
00:12:52,361 --> 00:12:55,240
the pair of rustic past that is unique 
to Katelyn.

225
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,193
It consists of an auxiliary verb related
to but not identical to the present 

226
00:12:59,921 --> 00:13:00,880
tense of the verb.

227
00:13:00,950 --> 00:13:04,300
ONA meaning to go followed by a verb in 
the infinitive.

228
00:13:04,630 --> 00:13:05,463
The pair of frantic past is identical 
and meaning to the simple past which is 

229
00:13:08,471 --> 00:13:09,304
now normally limited to literary use.
Note that the reflexive pronoun in a 

230
00:13:13,271 --> 00:13:14,104
different form can appear after the verb
instead if it's an infinitive or an 

231
00:13:17,471 --> 00:13:18,304
imperative or general.
So this could also be boggled of the 

232
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:24,290
water sup and the whole sentence could 
be a bug.

233
00:13:24,291 --> 00:13:25,124
A lot of the water [inaudible].
This verb construction is somewhat 

234
00:13:27,791 --> 00:13:31,810
surprising to me because it looks quite 
similar to the paraphrase stick future.

235
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:32,673
Using anon out of the waterside means he
is going to graduate with va being the 

236
00:13:37,511 --> 00:13:40,210
third person singular present tense of 
ONA.

237
00:13:40,930 --> 00:13:43,960
This [inaudible] future form is used 
lefts and Katelyn.

238
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:44,823
Then in some other romance languages 
probably because it resembles the pair 

239
00:13:47,551 --> 00:13:51,550
of frantic past.
So instead the simple future can be used

240
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:52,720
as a good of the water.

241
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:53,733
He will graduate in Catalan.
You typically formed the simple future 

242
00:13:56,981 --> 00:13:59,740
tense by adding a suffix to the 
infinitive form,

243
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:02,740
but for some irregular verbs there is a 
different future stem,

244
00:14:02,770 --> 00:14:05,290
not the infinitive.
In general,

245
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:06,153
the way the cattle and verbs are 
conjugated is quite similar to other 

246
00:14:08,561 --> 00:14:09,394
romance languages except that the exact 
forms are somewhat different with 

247
00:14:12,791 --> 00:14:13,624
Western romance languages in general.
If you speak one or if you've studied 

248
00:14:16,661 --> 00:14:17,494
one than the other,
seems somewhat familiar right off the 

249
00:14:19,271 --> 00:14:20,890
bat,
but on the other hand,

250
00:14:20,950 --> 00:14:23,080
everything seems somewhat different as 
well.

251
00:14:23,110 --> 00:14:25,810
There's some different vocabulary,
different phonology,

252
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:26,673
some different grammatical features and 
sometimes things are just expressed 

253
00:14:29,261 --> 00:14:32,220
differently.
Being previously unfamiliar with Katelyn

254
00:14:32,230 --> 00:14:33,063
for the most part,
what strikes me is that I noticed 

255
00:14:34,781 --> 00:14:37,360
features that are similar to Spanish to 
French,

256
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:39,850
to Italian,
to Portuguese into Romanian,

257
00:14:40,090 --> 00:14:40,923
but I would never confuse it with one of
those languages because it has its own 

258
00:14:43,601 --> 00:14:45,130
unique elements as well.

259
00:14:45,190 --> 00:14:47,830
The question of the day for speakers of 
Katelyn,

260
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:51,220
what other romance languages do you find
closest to Katelyn?

261
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:54,980
Can you communicate with Occitan 
speakers easily or Italian speakers,

262
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:55,833
et Cetera,
and for speakers of other romance 

263
00:14:57,501 --> 00:15:00,290
languages?
How familiar does Catalan seem to you?

264
00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:01,303
What differences stand out to you?
Special thanks to my friend Pablo who 

265
00:15:04,551 --> 00:15:06,830
helped with the audio samples for this 
video.

266
00:15:07,070 --> 00:15:10,940
He's from the Catalonia region of Spain 
and he's fluent in Catalan,

267
00:15:10,941 --> 00:15:12,080
Spanish,
English,

268
00:15:12,081 --> 00:15:14,750
Japanese,
and I believe some other languages too.

269
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:16,670
And he's a brilliant guy.
In general.

270
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:19,760
If you're studying Spanish or if you 
want to study Spanish,

271
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:22,820
I recommend you check out his channel,

00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:33,050
and instagram.
And once again,

276
00:15:33,051 --> 00:15:35,750
thank you to all of my amazing patrion 
supporters,

277
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:39,890
especially these ones because they are 
the best patrons in the world.

278
00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:43,040
Thank you for watching and have a nice 
day.
