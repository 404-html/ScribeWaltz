Hello Youtube artificial intelligence 
bots.

2
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:07,020
Please don't demonetize me.
This video has nothing to do with brexit

3
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:10,560
and there's absolutely nothing offensive
about the word cockney.

4
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:15,420
Today I want to examine a unique and 
extremely creative form of English slang

5
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:16,283
called cockney rhyming slang.
Cockneys are traditionally defined as 

6
00:00:19,201 --> 00:00:20,034
people living within earshot of the bow 
bells of the Saint Marie Leveaux church 

7
00:00:23,581 --> 00:00:24,414
in the east end of London,
but the term cockney has come to refer 

8
00:00:27,031 --> 00:00:31,230
to working class Londoners in various 
parts of the city and surrounding areas.

9
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:32,303
Cockney rhyming slang was first 
mentioned in a book published in 1859 

10
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:40,560
and had probably begun to be used in the
1840s so what the heck is it?

11
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:41,513
Okay,
I'll give you the most basic and cliche 

12
00:00:43,111 --> 00:00:44,910
example of cockney rhyming slang.

13
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:47,120
I went up the Alpha one Perez,

14
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:51,180
the phrase apples and pears is a 
substitute for the word stairs.

15
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:52,193
So you take a word that rhymes with the 
original word and then use it to create 

16
00:00:55,561 --> 00:00:56,394
a pair of related words.
That pair of words now represents the 

17
00:00:59,131 --> 00:01:02,910
original word in this case stairs.
Here's the most interesting part.

18
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:03,803
The second word of the pear,
the one that rhymes with the original 

19
00:01:06,151 --> 00:01:09,780
word is usually left out as in,
I went up the apples,

20
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:12,120
but how are you supposed to know what it
means?

21
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:13,133
Well,
originally this kind of slang was not 

22
00:01:14,431 --> 00:01:15,264
meant to be understood by everybody.
It was created by street merchants and 

23
00:01:18,331 --> 00:01:21,810
criminals in order to prevent other 
people from understanding what they were

24
00:01:21,811 --> 00:01:22,644
talking about,
but it soon became a colorful form of 

25
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:27,420
expression rather than just covert 
communication.

26
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:29,790
Let's look at some more classic 
examples.

27
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:30,683
We'll start with the word house.
A rhyming word is mouse a complimentary 

28
00:01:34,501 --> 00:01:38,100
where it is cat.
So cat and mouse means house.

29
00:01:38,270 --> 00:01:41,450
I went inside the canton mass and the 
apple and pears,

30
00:01:41,930 --> 00:01:45,590
theoretically possible to shorten both 
of the rhymes and say the sentence,

31
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:47,890
I went inside the car and up the air 
force.

32
00:01:48,410 --> 00:01:51,740
But it would probably be said the long 
wait in order to be less confusing.

33
00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:54,890
Here's another example using an animal 
word.

34
00:01:55,130 --> 00:01:58,100
The original word is phone.
Phone rhymes with bone.

35
00:01:58,220 --> 00:02:00,530
What animals are normally associated 
with bones.

36
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:03,470
Dogs of course.
So dog and bone means a phone.

37
00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:05,770
So there's this sentence,
pause this.

38
00:02:05,771 --> 00:02:09,020
The dog meaning passed me the phone in 
cockney speech,

39
00:02:09,050 --> 00:02:09,883
sometimes the plural pronoun us can be 
used with the singular meaning instead 

40
00:02:13,431 --> 00:02:17,300
of me.
Here's one more sort of household object

41
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:20,330
freezer.
A rhyming pair is Mona Lisa.

42
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:22,970
Notice here that in my North American 
accent,

43
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:23,923
Lisa and freezer don't run,
but the cockney dialect and most 

44
00:02:27,141 --> 00:02:31,250
dialects of England or non Roddick,
meaning that the are consonants are only

45
00:02:31,251 --> 00:02:32,084
pronounced before.
