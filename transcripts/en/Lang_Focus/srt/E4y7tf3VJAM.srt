Hello everyone.
Welcome to the Lange Focus Channel and 

2
00:00:03,571 --> 00:00:07,920
my name is Paul.
What should I talk about today?

3
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:11,790
Maybe I should talk about a language 
spoken by tens of millions of people.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:12,833
Maybe I should talk about one of the 
world's major language families or a 

5
00:00:15,541 --> 00:00:18,150
country with stunning linguistic 
diversity.

6
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:20,063
No,
I think today I'll talk about something 

7
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:25,890
a little different.
Today's topic is Toky Pona Toki Pona.

8
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:29,430
What's that?
Toki poner is a constructed language,

9
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:30,293
meaning that it did not arise naturally,
but it was created by someone in order 

10
00:00:33,841 --> 00:00:36,480
to fulfill certain criteria or a certain
vision.

11
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:40,140
The most well known constructed language
might be Esperanto,

12
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:42,660
which I made a video about a couple of 
years ago.

13
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:43,853
Toki Pono is another constructed 
language that I thought was unique and 

14
00:00:46,381 --> 00:00:48,390
interesting enough to make a video 
about.

15
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:49,253
It's not spoken by very many people,
but it's well known amongst fans of 

16
00:00:52,021 --> 00:00:55,710
constructed languages.
The name Toki Pono means the language of

17
00:00:55,711 --> 00:00:56,544
good and as a minimalist language.
The idea behind it is extreme 

18
00:01:00,091 --> 00:01:02,880
simplicity,
especially in its core vocabulary.

19
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:06,660
The purpose of Toki Pona is not just to 
simplify communication,

20
00:01:06,661 --> 00:01:07,494
but to simplify your own thinking.
To force yourself to eliminate 

21
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:14,100
unnecessary information and ideas and 
focus on what's really important.

22
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:18,990
Toki Pona has a core vocabulary of only 
123 words.

23
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:20,040
Yes,
you heard that,

24
00:01:20,041 --> 00:01:22,470
right?
123 words.

25
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:23,633
You can learn those hundred and 23 words
in just a couple of hours using an app 

26
00:01:26,731 --> 00:01:29,210
like memorize or unlucky.
I should point out that.
