Man.
Why does everyone say congee are so 

3
00:00:06,331 --> 00:00:08,130
difficult?
This one looks pretty easy.

4
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:11,040
So does this one and this one?
It's not bad.

5
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:14,010
And how about the next one?
Oh my gosh.

6
00:00:14,011 --> 00:00:19,011
What the heck is that?
Hello everyone.

7
00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:23,820
Welcome to the Lange Focus Channel and 
my name is Paul.

8
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:27,090
Today we're going to talk about the 
Japanese writing system.

9
00:00:27,270 --> 00:00:29,280
Well,
not the entire writing system.

10
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:32,010
Japanese is written with three different
scripts.

11
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:34,380
He's gonna cut that out,
and Congee,

12
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:36,600
which is the one that we want to focus 
on today.

13
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:39,420
He had gone to and cut to conduct,
were developed in Japan,

14
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:40,283
but congee are actually Chinese 
characters that were adapted to fit the 

15
00:00:43,351 --> 00:00:46,720
Japanese language.
Come Gr logograms a logo.

16
00:00:46,721 --> 00:00:50,700
Graham is a character that represents a 
word or a meaningful part of a word.

17
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:53,790
Congee are not characters that you read 
phonetically,

18
00:00:53,791 --> 00:00:57,900
but rather each congee represents a 
distinct idea rather than a sound.

19
00:00:58,410 --> 00:00:59,243
For example,
this congee on its own represents the 

20
00:01:00,991 --> 00:01:03,600
concept of a mountain,
but just from looking at it,

21
00:01:03,601 --> 00:01:06,150
there's no way to know that it's 
pronounced as Yama.

22
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:07,313
You have to remember how the characters 
pronounced and when you see the 

23
00:01:09,391 --> 00:01:11,340
character,
you associate it with the sound,

24
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:14,460
but some congee do also contain a 
phonetic element,

25
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:15,323
which is something we'll look at later.
Japan initially came into contact with 

26
00:01:18,391 --> 00:01:22,620
Chinese characters during diplomatic 
missions between the Han Dynasty and the

27
00:01:22,621 --> 00:01:23,454
Yamato State of Japan,
which eventually led to the Japanese 

28
00:01:25,801 --> 00:01:26,634
adoption and adaptation of Congee.
I talk more about this in my video on 

29
00:01:30,391 --> 00:01:31,224
the Japanese language,
which you can find right here if we 

30
00:01:33,961 --> 00:01:36,900
include every country that has ever been
used in Japanese.

31
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:40,560
There are tens of thousands of them,
but of course that includes many obscure

32
00:01:40,561 --> 00:01:43,230
or archaic congee.
There really aren't worth learning.

33
00:01:43,231 --> 00:01:44,064
For the average person in 1946,
the Japanese government aimed to 

34
00:01:47,431 --> 00:01:48,264
simplify orthography by limiting the 
number of congee to a smaller list of 

35
00:01:51,601 --> 00:01:52,434
1,850
country known as the Toyo Congee or 

36
00:01:55,711 --> 00:01:56,790
common use congee.

37
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:59,700
That list has since been updated to 
include 2000,

38
00:01:59,701 --> 00:02:00,534
136 basic congee,
which are referred to as the congee or 

39
00:02:04,650 --> 00:02:05,483
regular use congee.
This list determines what congee 

40
00:02:07,621 --> 00:02:08,454
students are expected to learn at school
and what congee or used in official 

41
00:02:11,251 --> 00:02:13,740
government documents.
With this part of the reform,

42
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:14,603
the Japanese government also simplified 
some of the more complex congee so that 

43
00:02:17,851 --> 00:02:21,120
they could be read more easily.
These congee are called Shinji tie,

44
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:23,700
which literally means new character 
forms.

45
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,120
For example,
this congee meaning iron,

46
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:28,230
the component on the right with 
simplified,

47
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:32,610
and this congee meaning wide.
It's inner component was simplified like

48
00:02:32,611 --> 00:02:33,444
this.
You might be aware that such a 

49
00:02:35,221 --> 00:02:36,054
simplification also occurred in the 
adoption of simplified Chinese writing 

50
00:02:39,181 --> 00:02:42,570
and trying to,
but we're much more limited in scope and

51
00:02:42,571 --> 00:02:43,404
these changes only affected a limited 
number of characters in Japanese types 

52
00:02:47,221 --> 00:02:48,054
of congee.
Congee can be divided into several 

53
00:02:49,861 --> 00:02:54,000
categories of mudgee or characters based
on how each character is formed.

54
00:02:54,210 --> 00:02:56,340
For example,
there are showcased Emoji.

55
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:57,383
This refers to pictograph congee such as
this one for a mountain or this one for 

56
00:03:00,881 --> 00:03:01,714
tree.
These ones look something like the 

57
00:03:02,891 --> 00:03:03,724
objects that they represent,
she g Magii and Kai Emoji are iddio 

58
00:03:07,610 --> 00:03:08,443
graphs,
characters that represent ideas rather 

59
00:03:10,511 --> 00:03:13,840
than visually representing an object.
For example,

60
00:03:13,841 --> 00:03:17,050
this congee meaning up and this one 
meaning rest.

61
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:20,890
The difference between these two types 
of video graphs is that she gmo,

62
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:22,053
are rather simple.
Whereas Emoji are compound idiographic 

63
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:25,983
that use multiple components that 
combined together to create an overall 

64
00:03:29,141 --> 00:03:32,950
meaning with each of the components also
existing as independent congee.

65
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,353
The component on the left means person 
and the components on the right means 

66
00:03:37,811 --> 00:03:38,644
tree.
A person leaning against the tree is 

67
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:43,470
resting.
This is a good example of Emoji.

68
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:47,350
Another example is this congee.
Let's see if we can figure out what this

69
00:03:47,351 --> 00:03:49,330
one means by looking at the components.

70
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:51,790
I see this character which I know means 
mountain,

71
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:55,240
and I see this one which means up and 
this one which means down,

72
00:03:55,390 --> 00:03:59,170
so I'm going to guess that this country 
has something to do with traveling up or

73
00:03:59,171 --> 00:04:02,110
down a mountain like maybe it's hiking.
Now,

74
00:04:02,111 --> 00:04:02,944
if we look at the actual meaning of this
country will see that it means a path 

75
00:04:05,681 --> 00:04:07,810
through the mountains or a mountain 
pass,

76
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:11,770
so I'd say that's pretty close.
This type of Congee that kind of tells a

77
00:04:11,771 --> 00:04:15,220
story is a of Emoji,
but only a small number of congee,

78
00:04:15,221 --> 00:04:17,290
telecom,
apprehensive story like that.

79
00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:18,243
By far,
the largest grouping of Kanji is Casei 

80
00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:21,503
Emoji.
These are congee that combined semantic 

81
00:04:22,841 --> 00:04:25,300
and phonetic elements to make up a new 
character.

82
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:29,440
The phonetic element is derived from the
Chinese pronunciation of the Congee,

83
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:31,540
the own your me,
which we'll talk about later.

84
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:34,240
A good example of case,
a Emoji is sheep,

85
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:35,320
which means poem.

86
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,300
If we look at the left side of the 
country,

87
00:04:37,330 --> 00:04:38,163
we see this component which is most 
often used in characters that have 

88
00:04:40,901 --> 00:04:42,880
something to do with language or 
speaking,

89
00:04:43,090 --> 00:04:45,850
such as this one meaning language and 
this one,

90
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:49,120
meaning speaking.
If we look at the component on the right

91
00:04:49,121 --> 00:04:52,060
side of this country,
we see the congee for temple.

92
00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:55,000
This doesn't indicate any semantic 
connection to temples,

93
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:58,510
but rather at serves as an indicator of 
how to pronounce this country.

94
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:02,650
The Chinese pronunciation of this Kanji 
for temple is sheep or ge,

95
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:05,380
and when you see it as a component 
within another congee,

96
00:05:05,410 --> 00:05:06,243
it indicates that that Congee is 
pronounced as sheet or GE radicals in 

97
00:05:10,331 --> 00:05:13,780
the characters we looked at in the 
previous example of case a Emoji.

98
00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:16,120
The component on the left is the 
radical.

99
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,073
A radical is the main component of a 
Kanji that generally provides a clue 

100
00:05:20,231 --> 00:05:21,400
about its root meaning.

101
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:22,383
Some people use the term radical to 
refer to any component of a congee like 

102
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:28,060
both of these,
but to be precise only.

103
00:05:28,061 --> 00:05:28,894
This element is the radical.
They'll both can be referred to as 

104
00:05:31,450 --> 00:05:35,260
components.
Every congee contains one radical.

105
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:36,153
Some radicals also exist as independent 
congee such as this one meaning gold or 

106
00:05:39,851 --> 00:05:40,684
money.
It appears as a radical with the root 

107
00:05:42,131 --> 00:05:42,964
meaning of metal.
Here we can see it and this congee 

108
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:47,650
meaning iron,
and in this one meaning copper.

109
00:05:48,130 --> 00:05:48,963
Other radicals only exist as an 
inseparable component of a Kanji like 

110
00:05:52,091 --> 00:05:52,924
this one,
which shows that the congee has a 

111
00:05:54,191 --> 00:05:57,740
meaning related to movement,
like in this congee meaning road,

112
00:05:58,010 --> 00:06:00,380
and this one meaning pass or 
communicate.

113
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:04,370
As for phonetic components,
they don't appear on all Kanji,

114
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:08,060
but they appear on many of them and can 
be very useful in pronouncing congee.

115
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:11,960
One example is this one which we saw 
before in the Kanji for copper.

116
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,690
This congee on its own is pronounced 
dove,

117
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:17,270
and when you see it as a component in 
another country,

118
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:20,390
it indicates that the pronunciation is 
Dole or toll.

119
00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:22,243
As you can see,
these congee here have nothing to do 

120
00:06:24,021 --> 00:06:26,600
with each other semantically and the 
radicals are different.

121
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:27,583
They're only related in pronunciation.
Another quick example is this congee 

122
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:33,830
meaning opposition.
It's pronounced hun.

123
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:36,650
Now look at this.
Congee meaning cooked rice or meal.

124
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:39,680
It's also pronounced Han based on that 
phonetic element,

125
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:44,030
and so it was this one meaning sales and
this one meaning printing or publishing.

126
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:45,980
They're all pronounced time.
Well,

127
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,980
they're sometimes pronounced time 
sometimes.

128
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:50,053
What do you mean?
Sometimes the phonetic elements of 

129
00:06:51,651 --> 00:06:54,350
congee or based on the Chinese reading 
of the Congee,

130
00:06:54,410 --> 00:06:55,243
also known as the O'neill meet reading 
and you'll meet just means reading by 

131
00:06:58,581 --> 00:07:01,730
the way,
own Naomi and Naomi.

132
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:04,820
If you remember from my previous video 
on Japanese,

133
00:07:04,850 --> 00:07:07,100
there are two basic ways to pronounce 
congee.

134
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:10,250
Own Naomi Chinese derived readings and 
couldn't.

135
00:07:10,251 --> 00:07:12,890
You'll meet native Japanese readings,
for example.

136
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:13,753
This character has a native couldn't 
reading of cutoff while also having the 

137
00:07:17,271 --> 00:07:19,850
own reading.
Hen when used in this word,

138
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:20,833
hemp meaning a broken piece.
The own Naomi is used when used in this 

139
00:07:24,141 --> 00:07:24,974
word Khatami,
meaning each way the native Naomi is 

140
00:07:28,041 --> 00:07:28,874
used.
The real complexity comes with the 

141
00:07:32,091 --> 00:07:36,320
congee that have multiple own readings 
and multiple coon readings requiring you

142
00:07:36,321 --> 00:07:38,990
to choose the correct reading based on 
the context.

143
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:42,440
One example is this congee meaning life 
or birth.

144
00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:45,920
It has to own your meter readings,
say and show.

145
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:48,050
So we have this word,
gene said,

146
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:53,260
meaning human life and this word to show
which means beast or it,

147
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:56,030
and it also has numerous Cuneo Naomi 
readings.

148
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:59,480
Here are some examples.
There's a key to meaning to live.

149
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:04,610
There's a meaning to give birth.
There's meaning to grow.

150
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:07,880
There's higher meaning to grow or spring
up.

151
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:13,100
There's key meaning pure or raw,
and there's no meaning raw or uncooked.

152
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:14,713
As you can see,
it's not always a simple matter of one 

153
00:08:16,791 --> 00:08:21,290
conduit being equivalent to one word.
The congee is used to represent the core

154
00:08:21,291 --> 00:08:24,170
meaning of the word,
but when we use them for native Japanese

155
00:08:24,171 --> 00:08:26,260
verbs and adjectives,
a string of Uba,

156
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:29,720
Ghana is attached to the end to 
represent the inflection of the word.

157
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:32,390
For example,
let's look at the adjective for cold.

158
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:33,950
Some Louie,
as you can see,

159
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:36,890
there's a congee and the additional 
Gunna he.

160
00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:37,963
The congee,
carries the core meaning of the word 

161
00:08:39,530 --> 00:08:41,330
while the inflection shown,
and he had a gun.

162
00:08:41,331 --> 00:08:46,100
It shows us that this word is in the non
past positive form for an adjective,

163
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:47,113
so we read this as some wheat,
but when we inflect this word in the 

164
00:08:49,731 --> 00:08:53,930
negative,
it becomes where crew night replaces eat

165
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:56,250
to indicate the non negative form.

166
00:08:56,430 --> 00:08:57,263
When we look at this word,
we know to read it as someone who night 

167
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:00,383
with the first two syllables represented
by the congee and the others placed 

168
00:09:03,751 --> 00:09:05,640
after it.
To show inflection comes,

169
00:09:05,641 --> 00:09:06,474
you also worked this way with verbs were
the congee will represent the core 

170
00:09:09,211 --> 00:09:11,970
meaning of the verb and the heat.
I gonna represent the verbs,

171
00:09:11,971 --> 00:09:12,804
conjugations.
Why bother using congee if part of the 

172
00:09:15,241 --> 00:09:16,074
writing is in Hida anyway,
even though congee take a lot of effort 

173
00:09:19,141 --> 00:09:19,974
to learn,
they actually make the entire language 

174
00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:24,840
easier to read.
Let's take a look at an example sentence

175
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:27,990
first written without congee and next 
written with congee.

176
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:31,510
This sentence means I eat Japanese food 
book wash,

177
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:32,580
Tub,
Amos,

178
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:35,190
because Japanese is written without 
spaces,

179
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:36,113
without the congee.
The words all blend together and it's 

180
00:09:38,101 --> 00:09:38,934
sometimes difficult to quickly see where
one word ends and where the next word 

181
00:09:41,851 --> 00:09:42,684
begins or it's difficult to see what 
part of speech or where it is congee or 

182
00:09:45,901 --> 00:09:48,900
not really read,
but just recognized like symbols.

183
00:09:48,930 --> 00:09:51,600
So they allow you to quickly skim a 
sentence for meeting,

184
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:55,260
but while Congee make Japanese easier to
read,

185
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:56,094
once you know them,
they make Japanese much harder to write 

186
00:09:58,290 --> 00:09:59,820
by hand.
As you can see,

187
00:09:59,850 --> 00:10:03,420
some congee consist of lots of different
lines or strokes.

188
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:04,800
For example,
this congee,

189
00:10:04,830 --> 00:10:08,430
meaning machine or opportunity,
has 16 strokes.

190
00:10:13,970 --> 00:10:16,940
This one,
meaning appraise has 23 strokes.

191
00:10:21,490 --> 00:10:22,323
If we dig back into some historical 
Kanji that are not part of the current 

192
00:10:25,270 --> 00:10:28,330
Joel Congee,
some of them have quite a high number of

193
00:10:28,331 --> 00:10:29,620
strokes.
This congee,

194
00:10:29,621 --> 00:10:32,320
meaning rough or crude,
has 33 strokes.

195
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:33,303
You can see that this one is actually 
created through reduplicate of the same 

196
00:10:36,371 --> 00:10:39,010
component three times.
That component is the congee,

197
00:10:39,011 --> 00:10:39,850
meaning deer.

198
00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:43,730
Here's another conduit,
meaning dragons on the move,

199
00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:44,623
which has 48 strokes and consists of the
congee for dragon reduplicated three 

200
00:10:48,711 --> 00:10:49,544
times as components,
and this congee features the same 

201
00:10:52,851 --> 00:10:55,850
component four times for a total of 64 
strokes.

202
00:10:56,090 --> 00:10:56,923
It means verbose.
The biggest freak show of a congee is 

203
00:11:00,261 --> 00:11:01,094
this one with 84 strokes.
It features this congee as a component 

204
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:08,000
which is itself a rigid application of 
the congee for cloud,

205
00:11:08,270 --> 00:11:10,370
and it also features the dragons on the 
move.

206
00:11:10,371 --> 00:11:11,204
Congee as a component.
I don't think the origins or usage of 

207
00:11:14,121 --> 00:11:14,954
this country are very clear,
but it may have been used in personal 

208
00:11:17,391 --> 00:11:19,950
names.
These high stroke congee are very rare.

209
00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:23,660
They're not really used anymore,
but congee have up to 20 strokes or even

210
00:11:23,661 --> 00:11:24,494
a little higher are quite common.
Not only do you have to remember the 

211
00:11:27,231 --> 00:11:28,064
strokes themselves,
but you have to write them in the 

212
00:11:29,361 --> 00:11:31,220
correct order in the correct direction.

213
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:33,740
There are a series of rules that govern 
stroke order.

214
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:38,330
The most basic rule is top to bottom and
left to right with the congee for river,

215
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:41,090
we can see that you write a stroke from 
top to bottom,

216
00:11:41,210 --> 00:11:43,790
then you move to the right and add two 
more strokes,

217
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:46,580
but the first stroke seems to go from 
right to left.

218
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,380
That's true,
but here are the top to bottom.

219
00:11:48,381 --> 00:11:49,214
Rule takes precedence,
so this has allowed the next when 

220
00:11:52,131 --> 00:11:52,964
vertical and horizontal cross,
the horizontal line is usually written 

221
00:11:56,351 --> 00:11:59,020
first.
We can see this in the congee for 10.

222
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:01,353
Next,
vertical strokes that cross through 

223
00:12:02,771 --> 00:12:05,800
other strokes are written after the 
strokes they cross through.

224
00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:06,783
We can see this in the congee,
meaning middle or in horizontal strokes 

225
00:12:10,691 --> 00:12:12,910
that cross through other strokes are 
written last.

226
00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:14,830
We can see this in the congee for 
mother.

227
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:16,503
Next diagonal strokes are written right 
to left before left to right as we can 

228
00:12:20,231 --> 00:12:22,570
see in the congee meaning letter or 
writings.

229
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:24,753
Next,
central vertical strokes are written 

230
00:12:26,651 --> 00:12:29,560
before their wings.
We can see this in the country,

231
00:12:29,561 --> 00:12:30,394
meaning water.
Next left vertical strokes are written 

232
00:12:34,061 --> 00:12:37,630
before strokes that go across and down.
As we can see in the congee,

233
00:12:37,631 --> 00:12:38,464
meaning mouth this across a downstroke 
is quite common and it's important not 

234
00:12:42,461 --> 00:12:44,920
to mistake it for two strokes.
It's just one stroke.

235
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:49,780
Next enclosures are normally written 
before the components inside them.

236
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:52,240
We can see that in the congee,
meaning wide.

237
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:54,873
An exception to that is some enclosures 
that have a bottom stroke which are 

238
00:12:57,581 --> 00:12:59,920
written last.
We can see this in the congee,

239
00:12:59,921 --> 00:13:00,790
meaning near

240
00:13:03,090 --> 00:13:06,840
and short little strokes or dashes are 
often written last,

241
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:09,330
even if that contradicts the top to 
bottom rule.

242
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:11,820
We can see this in the country,
meaning seek.

243
00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:13,943
Most of these stroke order rules become 
second nature after awhile if you 

244
00:13:16,621 --> 00:13:17,454
practice,
but I must admit that I hardly ever 

245
00:13:19,351 --> 00:13:20,184
write Kanji by hand these days.
These days people type on their 

246
00:13:22,321 --> 00:13:25,320
smartphones and computers a lot more 
than they write by hand.

247
00:13:26,310 --> 00:13:28,620
When typing congee on a smart phone or 
computer,

248
00:13:28,650 --> 00:13:29,483
you type the phonetic pronunciation and 
then a list of congee with that 

249
00:13:32,131 --> 00:13:35,010
pronunciation appears and you choose the
appropriate one.

250
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:36,053
A well known result of this reliance on 
technology is that Japanese speakers 

251
00:13:39,091 --> 00:13:41,670
ability to write Kanji by hand has 
declined.

252
00:13:41,850 --> 00:13:44,910
It's pretty common to see someone 
filling out a form or something and then

253
00:13:44,911 --> 00:13:47,670
pull out a smartphone to check how to 
write a certain congee.

254
00:13:48,990 --> 00:13:52,590
It's important to point out that not 
every native speaker of Japanese will be

255
00:13:52,591 --> 00:13:55,620
able to read every Kanji character that 
they encountered,

256
00:13:55,770 --> 00:13:58,020
especially in place names or personal 
names.

257
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,033
It's not uncommon for me to ask a native
speaker how to pronounce the name of a 

258
00:14:01,861 --> 00:14:03,000
place,
for example,

259
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,950
and for them to tell me that they don't 
know,

260
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:09,030
but they can often give it a shot based 
on what looks like a phonetic element in

261
00:14:09,031 --> 00:14:11,160
the congee and if they don't know the 
meaning,

262
00:14:11,161 --> 00:14:11,994
they might be able to guess the general 
meaning based on the radical of the 

263
00:14:14,581 --> 00:14:15,414
congee.
While learning congee is time consuming 

264
00:14:17,191 --> 00:14:18,024
and may seem overwhelming.
Remember that congee or a part of 

265
00:14:20,161 --> 00:14:22,830
Japanese culture,
history and literature,

266
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:26,760
and if you treat them like a puzzle to 
solve or a mystery to unravel,

267
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:30,780
then it becomes much more motivating and
the congee seem much less intimidating.

268
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:34,300
The question of the day for native 
speakers of Japanese,

269
00:14:34,450 --> 00:14:37,330
do you think congee are necessary for 
the Japanese language?

270
00:14:37,570 --> 00:14:40,510
Would you be able to speak Japanese the 
same as you do now?

271
00:14:40,511 --> 00:14:43,520
If congee,
we're not a part of the language and for

272
00:14:43,521 --> 00:14:46,760
learners of Japanese,
how much of a challenge or Kanji for you

273
00:14:46,910 --> 00:14:50,100
and how do you deal with the challenge?
Be sure to follow Lang,

274
00:14:50,110 --> 00:14:51,740
focus on facebook,
twitter,

275
00:14:51,741 --> 00:14:53,480
and Instagram,
and once again,

276
00:14:53,481 --> 00:14:56,000
thank you to all of my amazing patrion 
supporters,

277
00:14:56,030 --> 00:14:56,863
especially these ones right here on the 
screen who are my top tier patrion 

278
00:15:00,061 --> 00:15:00,894
supporters.
Thank you for watching and have a nice 

279
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:03,853
day.
