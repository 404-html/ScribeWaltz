1
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:09,673
Okay.

2
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:12,970
Hello everyone.
Welcome to the line focus channel and my

3
00:00:12,971 --> 00:00:13,804
name is Paul.
Today I'm going to talk about the 

4
00:00:15,671 --> 00:00:17,530
Turkish language.
Now,

5
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:18,393
right off the bat,
the first thing I want to say is that 

6
00:00:19,991 --> 00:00:20,824
there is a Turkish language because 
Turkey is situated at the edge of the 

7
00:00:24,910 --> 00:00:25,743
Middle East.
Some people think that Turkey is an 

8
00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:29,470
Arabic country,
but it is not an Arabic country.

9
00:00:29,590 --> 00:00:30,423
The language of Turkey is Turkish,
although there is a small Arabic 

10
00:00:33,431 --> 00:00:34,264
speaking minority in Turkey,
there are around 75 million native 

11
00:00:37,061 --> 00:00:40,240
speakers of Turkish.
That includes 10 to 15 million people in

12
00:00:40,241 --> 00:00:42,880
southeastern Europe.
That's mainly in the part of Turkey,

13
00:00:42,881 --> 00:00:43,714
that's located in Europe,
but also as a minority language in the 

14
00:00:46,211 --> 00:00:47,044
Balkan area,
and it includes 60 to 65 million people 

15
00:00:49,631 --> 00:00:52,330
in Anatolia.
That's the part of Turkey that's located

16
00:00:52,331 --> 00:00:55,540
inside of Asia.
Now those numbers are for Turkish,

17
00:00:55,570 --> 00:00:56,403
but there are other languages inside the
Turkic language family that have a 

18
00:00:59,531 --> 00:01:02,530
relatively high degree of mutual 
intelligibility,

19
00:01:02,650 --> 00:01:06,160
and some people consider those languages
to be dialects of Turkish.

20
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:06,993
So if we include those,
the number might be as high as 109 

21
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:11,193
million people,
but let's back up and look at the 

22
00:01:12,191 --> 00:01:13,024
classification of Turkish.
Because Turkey is located partly inside 

23
00:01:15,731 --> 00:01:16,564
of Europe,
you might have thought that Turkish is 

24
00:01:17,561 --> 00:01:18,394
an Indo European language or a Slavic 
language and because part of Turkey is 

25
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:24,850
located on the edge of the Middle East,
you might have thought that Turkish is a

26
00:01:24,851 --> 00:01:27,010
Semitic language,
but it is none of the above.

27
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:30,340
The Turkic language family is a separate
family unto itself.

28
00:01:30,370 --> 00:01:31,203
The Turkic languages are sometimes 
thought to be a part of larger language 

29
00:01:34,061 --> 00:01:36,220
family called the [inaudible] language 
family,

30
00:01:36,221 --> 00:01:37,054
which includes some other language 
groups like the Mongolian language 

31
00:01:39,221 --> 00:01:42,730
family that Japonica and the chorionic 
language family amongst others,

32
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:46,930
but this is not a generally accepted 
theory bilinguist it tends to be debated

33
00:01:46,931 --> 00:01:49,510
and these days it seems to be fairly 
discredited.

34
00:01:49,630 --> 00:01:52,930
Turkish is part of the ohs branch of the
Turkic language family.

35
00:01:52,930 --> 00:01:53,763
It also includes Azerbaijani,
which is sometimes called Azeri Turkish 

36
00:01:57,010 --> 00:02:00,610
as well as Turkmen as well as some other
languages like Qashqai,

37
00:02:00,611 --> 00:02:01,444
which is spoken in some parts of Iran.
The languages of the ohs branch are all 

38
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:05,763
mutually intelligible to some extent,
and these are the languages that are 

39
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:11,500
sometimes considered to be dialects of 
Turkish Azeri.

40
00:02:11,501 --> 00:02:15,040
Turkish is spoken in Azerbaijan,
them as well as parts of Iran,

41
00:02:15,070 --> 00:02:16,390
Iraq,
Dagestan,

42
00:02:16,391 --> 00:02:19,780
and Georgia,
and it has 26 million native speakers.

43
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:23,440
Turkmen has 8 million native speakers,
including 3.5

44
00:02:23,441 --> 00:02:27,820
million in Turkmenistan,
2 million in northwestern Iran and 1.5

45
00:02:27,821 --> 00:02:28,654
million in northwestern Afghanistan.
All Turkic languages descended from a 

46
00:02:32,051 --> 00:02:34,570
theoretical language called [inaudible] 
Turkish.

47
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:37,130
Okay.

48
00:02:37,130 --> 00:02:41,300
The Turkic peoples originated in Central
Asia and through migration they expanded

49
00:02:41,301 --> 00:02:42,134
over a wide area extending all the way 
from Siberia down through China and 

50
00:02:45,741 --> 00:02:46,574
Central Asia through the Middle East,
up into the Balkan area and even north 

51
00:02:50,061 --> 00:02:50,894
of the Black Sea owes Turkic the 
ancestor language of modern day Turkish 

52
00:02:54,201 --> 00:02:55,034
language as well as all the languages of
the ohs branch was brought to Anatolia 

53
00:02:58,581 --> 00:03:02,800
by the Seljuk Empire,
a Turkic Empire in the 11th century Ce.

54
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:03,783
The seljuk empire had previously adopted
Islam and they were admirers of Persian 

55
00:03:07,301 --> 00:03:11,080
culture and they were influenced by the 
Persian language and the Arabic language

56
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:13,930
person became the administrative and 
literary language.

57
00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:16,420
While Arabic was used for religious 
purposes,

58
00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:19,420
but Turkish was still spoken by the 
average common people.

59
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:23,250
Later when the Ottoman empire a rose in 
place of the Seljuk Empire,

60
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:24,153
the official language would be a form of
Turkish that was highly influenced by 

61
00:03:27,251 --> 00:03:28,084
Persian and Arabic.
This form of Turkish became known as 

62
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:31,690
ultimate Turkish.

63
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:34,120
Ottoman Turkish was big stone,
Turkish grammar,

64
00:03:34,121 --> 00:03:36,880
but with some influence from Persian and
Arabic grammar,

65
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,600
but it was the vocabulary that was most 
influenced by Persian and Arabic.

66
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:44,890
Sometimes up to 88% of the vocabulary 
used was Persian and Arabic.

67
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:46,990
This was the language of the elite 
people,

68
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:50,440
not the language of the common people,
which had much less foreign influence,

69
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:52,630
although it did still have some foreign 
influence.

70
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:54,880
When the modern republic of Turkey was 
founded.

71
00:03:54,881 --> 00:03:55,714
In 1923 Mustafa came out,
Ataturk created the Turkish language 

72
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:02,800
association to initiate a reform of the 
Turkish language.

73
00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:05,560
He essentially got rid of that 
administrative language,

74
00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:06,443
Ottoman Turkish,
and he replaced it with a new standard 

75
00:04:08,231 --> 00:04:09,064
language based on the everyday common 
language spoken in Istanbul and effort 

76
00:04:12,911 --> 00:04:16,690
was made to replace Persian and Arabic 
words with native Turkish words.

77
00:04:16,691 --> 00:04:20,230
Sometimes those were archaic Turkish 
words that were brought back to life and

78
00:04:20,231 --> 00:04:21,064
sometimes they were newly created 
Turkish words taken from Turkish roots 

79
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:27,880
and other big changes that Turkish was 
switched from the Arabic alphabet,

80
00:04:27,881 --> 00:04:31,030
the Arabic writing system to a modified 
Latin alphabet,

81
00:04:31,031 --> 00:04:33,520
which was much more suitable for reading
and writing.

82
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,353
Turkish Arabic has only three short 
vowels and three long vowels while the 

83
00:04:38,321 --> 00:04:39,154
Turkish language has eight vowels.
So that created a lot of confusion in 

84
00:04:42,101 --> 00:04:42,934
reading and writing in Turkish.
And the literacy rates had always been 

85
00:04:45,311 --> 00:04:46,144
very low,
but after switching to the Latin 

86
00:04:47,801 --> 00:04:49,990
alphabet,
the literacy rates skyrocketed.

87
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:50,913
What the common people haven't always 
accepted the suggestions by the Turkish 

88
00:04:53,861 --> 00:04:54,694
language association.
So some of those foreign loan words in 

89
00:04:56,921 --> 00:05:00,040
Turkish still exist alongside and native
Turkish words.

90
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:02,140
So sometimes there are two words for the
same thing,

91
00:05:02,141 --> 00:05:06,190
one Turkish and one Persian or Arabic,
and they might have the same meaning,

92
00:05:06,191 --> 00:05:07,024
but they're used in a slightly different
way or have a slightly different sense 

93
00:05:09,491 --> 00:05:10,324
to the meaning before I mentioned the 
Azeri language as well as the Turkmen 

94
00:05:13,061 --> 00:05:13,894
language,
which are sometimes considered a 

95
00:05:14,751 --> 00:05:15,584
dialects of Turkish,
but they are actually more similar to 

96
00:05:18,191 --> 00:05:22,450
the Turkish that was spoken before 
auditors reform of the Turkish language.

97
00:05:22,570 --> 00:05:25,630
That is to say that they use more 
Persian and Arabic loan words.

98
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:30,040
Then the modern day standard Turkish of 
Turkey uses and also Azerbaijan.

99
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:33,460
Turkmenistan were under the control of 
the USSR for a long time.

100
00:05:33,461 --> 00:05:36,910
So there are also some Russian loan 
words and from what I understand,

101
00:05:36,911 --> 00:05:37,744
there are a lot of funny 
misunderstandings between the different 

102
00:05:39,581 --> 00:05:42,340
varieties of Turkish Azerbaijani or 
Azeri.

103
00:05:42,341 --> 00:05:43,174
Turkish was always referred to as 
Turkish until the Soviet Union 

104
00:05:46,031 --> 00:05:46,864
controlled Azerbaijan and they changed 
the name of that language as a way of 

105
00:05:49,811 --> 00:05:54,040
trying to create an identity for those 
people that was separate from the people

106
00:05:54,041 --> 00:05:54,874
in Turkey.
That was another divide and conquer 

107
00:05:56,531 --> 00:05:57,364
tactic.
Just from reading some comments around 

108
00:05:58,791 --> 00:05:59,624
the Internet,
the level of intelligibility between 

109
00:06:01,341 --> 00:06:02,174
standard Turkish and Azeri Turkish 
varies from 60% to 90% but even for the 

110
00:06:07,371 --> 00:06:08,204
people who understand less of it,
it seems that they get used to it quite 

111
00:06:10,881 --> 00:06:11,714
quickly and it's simply a matter of 
familiarity and a little bit of 

112
00:06:14,121 --> 00:06:14,780
adjustment.

113
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:15,613
For example,
one guy wrote in his comment that if a 

114
00:06:17,091 --> 00:06:19,820
Turkish person takes an airplane to 
Azerbaijan,

115
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:22,490
maybe in the morning he won't really 
understand very well,

116
00:06:22,491 --> 00:06:24,890
but by the afternoon he'll be completely
fluent.

117
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:25,873
And if that is the case,
then I would definitely say that those 

118
00:06:27,381 --> 00:06:29,510
are just two dialects of the same 
language.

119
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:32,570
So let's look at some features of the 
Turkish language.

120
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:33,493
Turkish is an a gluten native language.
A glutenous of means that the words are 

121
00:06:36,891 --> 00:06:40,250
comprised of pieces that all add to the 
meaning of the word.

122
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:41,113
So whereas in English,
you might express something with a few 

123
00:06:43,221 --> 00:06:44,300
words.
In Turkish,

124
00:06:44,301 --> 00:06:47,150
that might just be one word,
or it might be fewer words,

125
00:06:47,151 --> 00:06:47,984
because instead of using an extra word,
you just add an extra piece to the word 

126
00:06:51,171 --> 00:06:52,004
you're already using,
and that means you can sometimes get 

127
00:06:53,481 --> 00:06:54,314
some surprisingly long words in Turkish.
Let's look at an example of a gluten 

128
00:06:57,981 --> 00:06:59,500
nation thought to be,
yeah,

129
00:06:59,770 --> 00:07:04,770
it's hard to bscs Tattoo bscs Lik Tattoo
bscs licked Larry [inaudible] that in.

130
00:07:06,090 --> 00:07:08,870
Then that'd be a sizzling that in done 
mish,

131
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:13,070
so you can see that if we add a piece to
the end of the word,

132
00:07:13,071 --> 00:07:13,904
we're adding to the meaning of the word.
This way of attaching suffixes to the 

133
00:07:16,881 --> 00:07:17,714
end of a word is also used to make 
plural forms possessive forums and to 

134
00:07:20,631 --> 00:07:21,464
show grammatical case for announce.
Let's look at an example for the plural 

135
00:07:24,621 --> 00:07:25,300
form

136
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:26,680
bash,
bash,

137
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:27,910
lad,
f,

138
00:07:28,210 --> 00:07:29,043
F,
Lad.

139
00:07:29,410 --> 00:07:32,200
Let's look at another example with 
possession this time,

140
00:07:32,690 --> 00:07:34,770
Taser,
Taser,

141
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:37,710
Taser,
Taser,

142
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:38,573
knees.

143
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:42,620
Let's look at an example of the 
grammatical cases in Turkish.

144
00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:45,030
There are six grammatical cases in 
Turkish.

145
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,033
And again,
if you don't know what a grammatical 

146
00:07:46,821 --> 00:07:47,654
case is,
that means that the form of the noun 

147
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:51,920
changes depending on its function.
In the sentence,

148
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:55,970
the word we're using his tree arch,
our June,

149
00:07:56,930 --> 00:07:57,763
uh,
[inaudible],

150
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,460
uh,
[inaudible],

151
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,680
uh,
[inaudible] [inaudible].

152
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:04,513
So you can see that the form of that now
changes depending on what function it 

153
00:08:07,341 --> 00:08:10,070
fulfills in that sentence,
how hard is Turkish to learn?

154
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:12,110
Well,
that depends on your native language.

155
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:14,840
If your native language is an a gluten 
native language,

156
00:08:14,841 --> 00:08:17,060
or if you know another,
a glutenous of language,

157
00:08:17,210 --> 00:08:19,580
then Turkish might seem more familiar to
you.

158
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:22,460
But if you have never spoken a language 
like that before,

159
00:08:22,461 --> 00:08:25,070
you might have to get used to a whole 
new way of thinking.

160
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:25,963
But the good news is that Turkish 
grammar is very systematic and very 

161
00:08:28,611 --> 00:08:29,240
consistent.

162
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:30,073
And so was the writing system.
Turkish is almost entirely a phonetic 

163
00:08:32,691 --> 00:08:33,524
language.
That means that for each sound there is 

164
00:08:34,971 --> 00:08:37,010
one letter.
So when you read a word,

165
00:08:37,011 --> 00:08:39,770
you know how to pronounce it.
And when you know how to say a word,

166
00:08:39,771 --> 00:08:41,510
you know how to write it.
And as always,

167
00:08:41,511 --> 00:08:43,670
if you're deeply fascinated with the 
culture,

168
00:08:43,671 --> 00:08:44,504
then it doesn't matter if the language 
is challenging because you will be 

169
00:08:46,430 --> 00:08:47,263
motivated enough to get past those 
challenges and you'll enjoy it every 

170
00:08:50,271 --> 00:08:51,104
step of the web.
So if you happen to be very interested 

171
00:08:53,241 --> 00:08:57,750
in Turkey or in Azerbaijan or or other 
places where a tricky is just spoken,

172
00:08:57,751 --> 00:09:00,660
then don't hesitate to start learning 
the Turkish language.

173
00:09:00,810 --> 00:09:02,670
Thank you for watching the langue focus 
channel.

174
00:09:03,090 --> 00:09:06,510
What should the question of the day be?
I can't decide between a couple.

175
00:09:06,511 --> 00:09:07,344
So I'll give you two choices.
So people who speak Turkish or have 

176
00:09:09,421 --> 00:09:10,254
studied Turkish,
do you think that Azeri Turkish and 

177
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:15,240
Turkmen or the same language,
dialects of the same language?

178
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:16,133
How well do you understand each other?
And another question that I'm curious 

179
00:09:19,201 --> 00:09:20,034
about Turkish people.
If you tried to read Ottoman Turkish 

180
00:09:22,681 --> 00:09:24,780
from that period,
how well do you understand it?

181
00:09:24,781 --> 00:09:25,614
Are there too many loan words,
too much Persian and Arabic for you to 

182
00:09:27,781 --> 00:09:28,614
understand more?
Is it close enough that you can 

183
00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:32,970
understand it?
Let us know in the comments down below.

184
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:37,020
Everyone else comment as you wish.
Have a nice day.

185
00:09:58,610 --> 00:09:59,443
Yeah.
