00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:01,163
Hello everyone,
welcome to the Lange Focus Channel and 

2
00:00:03,181 --> 00:00:04,014
my name is Paul.
Today's topic is the Java language as 

3
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:09,030
Spanish creole.
In fact,

4
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:11,910
the only Spanish based Creole language 
in Asia.

5
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:15,280
The name of the language comes from the 
Spanish word Shabacado,

6
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:16,463
meaning vulgar or in poor taste.
That's because [inaudible] was 

7
00:00:19,381 --> 00:00:22,020
originally considered incorrect or 
corrupted.

8
00:00:22,021 --> 00:00:22,854
Spanish Java Condo is spoken in the 
Philippines and as a direct result of 

9
00:00:26,851 --> 00:00:29,130
the Philippines history as a Spanish 
colony.

10
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:31,800
It's not spoken by the majority of 
Filipinos,

11
00:00:31,801 --> 00:00:34,530
but by a minority living in specific 
areas.

12
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:37,620
It spoken in different varieties in 
Cavita,

13
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:42,710
a province just south of Metro Manila in
Cotabato on the island of Mindanao,

14
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:47,700
Basilan island to the south of Mindanao,
and it's spoken by the largest number of

15
00:00:47,701 --> 00:00:48,534
speakers in Zamboanga,
especially in Zamboanga City on 

16
00:00:51,361 --> 00:00:52,194
Mindanao.
It's notoriously difficult to find 

17
00:00:54,331 --> 00:00:57,570
consistent statistics about the number 
of Java speakers,

18
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,830
but according to the United Nations 
statistics division in 2005,

19
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:04,860
there were 431,000
native speakers,

20
00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:08,280
including around 311,000
in Zamboanga.

21
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:11,820
But those numbers underestimate the 
number of people who speak Java.

22
00:01:11,821 --> 00:01:12,654
Condo zone belonged to a city,
a city with over a million people is a 

23
00:01:15,631 --> 00:01:19,320
very diverse place with migrants from 
all over the Philippines and Java.

24
00:01:19,321 --> 00:01:21,780
Camo serves as the most common Lingua 
Franca.

25
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:25,620
So hundreds of thousands more people 
speak it as a second or third language.

26
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:27,960
So what is it exactly?
Is it Spanish?

27
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:29,220
Well,
not exactly.

28
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:30,083
It's a Spanish based creole,
meaning that Spanish is the lexus fire 

29
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:33,803
language,
the language that supplied most of the 

30
00:01:35,191 --> 00:01:39,270
vocabulary while the grammar is largely 
based on Filipino languages,

31
00:01:39,271 --> 00:01:43,560
like the science to catalog and guy 
known the Spanish colonial period.

32
00:01:43,561 --> 00:01:47,130
And the Philippines began in 15,
21 and beginning in 15,

33
00:01:47,131 --> 00:01:47,964
65,
the Philippine islands began to be 

34
00:01:49,621 --> 00:01:52,350
administered from the vice royalty of 
new Spain,

35
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:53,273
which was based in Mexico City.
This continued until Mexico's 

36
00:01:56,071 --> 00:01:56,904
independence in 18,
21 after which the Philippines were 

37
00:01:59,491 --> 00:02:03,750
administered directly by Spain,
but for those 256 years,

38
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:04,613
Philippines had significant interaction 
with new Spain and it's people during 

39
00:02:07,981 --> 00:02:09,870
this time,
the Philippines and new Spain.

40
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:14,460
We're connected by the galleon trade,
large trading ship voyages that made the

41
00:02:14,461 --> 00:02:17,760
journey between Manila Acapulco once or 
twice a year.

42
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:19,093
This brought Filipinos in contact with 
Spanish speaking workers from new Spain 

43
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:25,380
while soldiers and settlers from Spain 
were present.

44
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:29,160
Soldiers and settlers from new span also
arrived in significant numbers.

45
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,233
One place where many newcomers settled 
wasn't assemble under which the Spanish 

46
00:02:33,271 --> 00:02:34,104
seized in 16,
35 in an attempt to stop attacks by 

47
00:02:36,691 --> 00:02:37,524
morrow pirates,
they established a fortress called at a 

48
00:02:40,131 --> 00:02:43,710
Alpharetta.
They San Jose Royal Court of St Joseph.

49
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:48,330
The population of this fort had a direct
impact on the development of the avocado

50
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:51,870
spoken in Zamboanga.
There were Visayan warriors from say boo

51
00:02:51,871 --> 00:02:54,000
and other areas,
Spanish soldiers,

52
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:56,070
including those from Spain,
Mexico,

53
00:02:56,071 --> 00:02:56,904
as well as Peru and Jesuit priests who 
served Spanish translators and might 

54
00:03:01,481 --> 00:03:03,340
have taught the others how to 
communicate,

55
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:07,030
resulting in a pigeon language that 
would become the travel condo creole.

56
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:08,343
This fort was eventually abandoned,
but some of the population remained and 

57
00:03:11,471 --> 00:03:12,304
continued to interact with locals while 
the Jesuit priests continued their 

58
00:03:15,311 --> 00:03:16,144
conversion efforts.
This both spread Java condo and brought 

59
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:19,713
additional influences to the language 
making it a little more Filipino and a 

60
00:03:22,841 --> 00:03:23,674
little less Spanish.
This is the kind of contact that 

61
00:03:25,721 --> 00:03:28,930
resulted in the creation of other forms 
of Java condo as well,

62
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:31,270
but the exact influences were somewhat 
different.

63
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:34,360
For example,
the Java condo spoken and covey tape has

64
00:03:34,361 --> 00:03:35,194
more Castilian,
Spanish influence and less Mexican 

65
00:03:37,061 --> 00:03:40,990
Spanish influence and has more Tagalog 
influence rather than be cited.

66
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:42,303
Now let's look at some features of 
avocado and see how it differs from 

67
00:03:44,801 --> 00:03:47,800
Spanish.
I'm focusing mainly on Zumba on Daniel,

68
00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:50,260
that Java condo creole spoken in 
Zamboanga.

69
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:51,813
We'll start by focusing on the syntax 
and I'll introduce additional elements 

70
00:03:54,911 --> 00:03:58,150
as we go.
While Spanish is generally Svo,

71
00:03:58,420 --> 00:03:59,253
Java,
Camo is generally vso like Tagalo or 

72
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:02,423
resign.

73
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:03,693
Here's the sentence,
meaning the men looked at Jose in 

74
00:04:06,101 --> 00:04:09,700
Spanish in middle,
and in Java,

75
00:04:09,710 --> 00:04:14,710
O'connell in Spanish,
the subject alone comes first,

76
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:19,090
but in Java condo it comes after the 
verb.

77
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:22,720
There are some other important things we
can notice about the sentence.

78
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:24,063
The verb,
middle from Merdod means look in 

79
00:04:26,891 --> 00:04:27,724
Spanish,
while in Java it means both look and 

80
00:04:29,831 --> 00:04:32,470
see,
so depending on the intended meaning,

81
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:33,333
the Spanish translation might be 
elluminate br plus a using a different 

82
00:04:37,091 --> 00:04:38,110
verb to mean.
See,

83
00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:41,110
also notice that the verb forms are 
slightly different.

84
00:04:41,410 --> 00:04:43,900
The Spanish verb is conjugated for the 
third person,

85
00:04:43,901 --> 00:04:47,560
singular conjugation in the Predator it 
or past historic tents,

86
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:50,290
but Java Kennel verbs are conjugated at 
all.

87
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:51,273
The verb.
Madonna will be the same for any 

88
00:04:53,021 --> 00:04:53,854
subject.
The only thing that can change is this 

89
00:04:55,751 --> 00:04:59,290
extra little piece right here,
which is a proverb that shows tents.

90
00:04:59,530 --> 00:05:01,810
Yeah,
indicates past top,

91
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:05,050
indicates present,
and I indicates future.

92
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:09,100
These are not always used but can be 
used for clarity and for emphasis.

93
00:05:09,730 --> 00:05:12,310
Also,
notice that Java condo uses Khan instead

94
00:05:12,311 --> 00:05:15,580
of our column,
comes from the Spanish word con,

95
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:16,473
meaning with,
but in Java Kunle it's used as the 

96
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:19,353
object or accusative marker,
so already we can see a number of 

97
00:05:22,451 --> 00:05:24,490
differences between Spanish and Chava 
condo.

98
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:27,730
Another example,
here's a sentence,

99
00:05:27,731 --> 00:05:31,240
meaning you teach children,
you being the plural form.

100
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:32,553
In Spanish,
we'll status and Nina's and in Java 

101
00:05:35,801 --> 00:05:39,880
connell the insignia that again in 
Spanish,

102
00:05:39,881 --> 00:05:42,170
the subject comes first and the Java 
condo.

103
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:45,720
It comes after the verb and you'll 
notice the present tense verb,

104
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:46,593
top before the verb now is a locomotive 
particle or preposition which shows 

105
00:05:50,501 --> 00:05:54,790
direction or location.
Apparently it comes from a historian and

106
00:05:54,791 --> 00:05:55,624
note the difference in vocabulary for 
the words meaning children in Java 

107
00:05:58,450 --> 00:05:59,283
Kunle,
you'll see the phrase Monga Manga is a 

108
00:06:01,521 --> 00:06:02,354
plural marker found in Tagalo,
Visayan and Haley Guy Known in Java 

109
00:06:05,461 --> 00:06:05,780
candle.

110
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:06,613
This is sometimes used as the plural 
marker and the Spanish plural form with 

111
00:06:09,321 --> 00:06:12,830
s or s is sometimes used.
Another example.

112
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:13,813
Here's the sentence,
meaning I love you in Spanish or the 

113
00:06:17,530 --> 00:06:22,380
ammo and the Java Kunle on my ego or 
that my yield,

114
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:26,300
but indego this time,
the Spanish sentence is Sov,

115
00:06:26,330 --> 00:06:29,300
not Svo,
because when the object is a pronoun,

116
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:32,030
it usually comes before the verb,
but in Spanish,

117
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:32,893
the subject pronouns can be dropped 
because the person in number are clear 

118
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,910
from the conjugation of the verb.
In Java,

119
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:40,040
however,
verbs are conjugated,

120
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:44,870
so the subject Pronoun is necessary and 
notice that the top is optional.

121
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:46,153
Earlier we saw that cone meaning with in
Spanish is used as the object marker in 

122
00:06:50,021 --> 00:06:52,460
Java candle here,
Contigo,

123
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:56,330
which means with you in Spanish,
is used as the object Pronoun.

124
00:06:56,840 --> 00:07:01,130
All of the subject pronouns of Spanish 
origin have an object pronoun equivalent

125
00:07:01,131 --> 00:07:02,780
like this that begins with colon.

126
00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:03,763
There are other subject pronouns of 
Filipino origin and their corresponding 

127
00:07:06,471 --> 00:07:08,930
object.
Pronouns are also a Filipino origin.

128
00:07:09,290 --> 00:07:10,123
Some pronouns might come from Filipino 
languages because they communicate 

129
00:07:12,861 --> 00:07:15,470
something that the Spanish pronouns 
couldn't communicate.

130
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:16,580
Notice,
for example,

131
00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:19,880
the first person,
plural pronouns come in and Kita,

132
00:07:20,030 --> 00:07:22,760
which come from Visayan,
some Austronesian languages,

133
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:24,800
including some languages of the 
Philippines.

134
00:07:24,801 --> 00:07:27,050
Distinguished between the first person,
plural,

135
00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:30,170
inclusive of the listener and exclusive 
of the listener.

136
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:32,900
Another example,
here's a sentence,

137
00:07:32,901 --> 00:07:35,420
meaning this is Pablo.
In Spanish,

138
00:07:35,730 --> 00:07:40,730
it's the low and in Java candle again,
in Spanish,

139
00:07:41,391 --> 00:07:44,330
the subject comes first.
It's the demonstrative Pronoun.

140
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:45,313
Sdi.
In Chicago it comes after the predicate 

141
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:49,880
and you can see that the pronoun is 
abbreviated,

142
00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:50,743
but it's not always so there's actually 
no verb in this sentence because Java 

143
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:54,493
condo has no copy Copula,
so the word order is really predicate 

144
00:07:57,140 --> 00:07:57,973
subject.
The word see is a subject marker for 

145
00:07:59,931 --> 00:08:00,764
personal names,
which is also found in Tagalog and 

146
00:08:03,021 --> 00:08:05,540
healy,
guy known in Spanish.

147
00:08:05,570 --> 00:08:06,403
Demonstrative pronouns have gender,
but Java cundall has no grammatical 

148
00:08:09,351 --> 00:08:12,020
gender.
So for a female name in Spanish it would

149
00:08:12,021 --> 00:08:15,920
be like this is that is Trisha with a 
change in the pronouns.

150
00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:16,943
While then Sheva Condo,
it would be this with no change in the 

151
00:08:20,781 --> 00:08:21,614
Pronoun and other elements of the world 
order that is different is that 

152
00:08:24,681 --> 00:08:26,930
adjectives come before nouns.
In Java candle,

153
00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:27,823
not after.
In Spanish we have limited meaning free 

154
00:08:31,071 --> 00:08:36,071
time,
and in Java we have another sentence.

155
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:40,430
Here's the sentence,
meaning I love their house in Spanish,

156
00:08:40,570 --> 00:08:45,570
you almost,
and in Java Kunle again,

157
00:08:47,331 --> 00:08:50,360
notice that in the Spanish sentence you 
can drop the subject,

158
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:52,940
but in Java condo you can't.
The third person,

159
00:08:52,941 --> 00:08:56,220
plural,
possessive pronoun in Java is de la.

160
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:57,533
The possessive pronouns typically 
consist of d prefix to the beginning of 

161
00:09:00,841 --> 00:09:02,310
the Spanish subject,
pronouns,

162
00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:05,820
or to Filipino clinic pronouns.
Another sentence,

163
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:06,713
here's the sentence,
meaning Helena or Jane bought a second 

164
00:09:09,211 --> 00:09:10,800
dog in Spanish.

165
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:15,480
Why not?
And in Java one pro one,

166
00:09:15,650 --> 00:09:17,580
you've got those battle.
Again,

167
00:09:17,581 --> 00:09:18,414
we see the SVO versus vsl.
We see the subject Marker C and a pre 

168
00:09:22,591 --> 00:09:25,590
verb in Java Condo,
and we see the word for dog.

169
00:09:26,010 --> 00:09:26,843
There's one new thing to notice here.
The ordinal numbers in Spanish is 

170
00:09:29,730 --> 00:09:32,170
Segundo,
but in Java condo it's eco dose.

171
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:36,510
The cardinal numbers of Java Convo,
like those are all basically the same as

172
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:38,640
in Spanish,
but with slightly different spelling,

173
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:41,880
but while Spanish has different forms 
for ordinal numbers,

174
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:43,470
Shavano,
prefixes,

175
00:09:43,530 --> 00:09:44,363
eco to cardinal numbers,
notice that the Spanish ordinal number 

176
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:48,793
pretty metal is used,
and other Spanish ones can be used in 

177
00:09:51,391 --> 00:09:53,610
place of the Cheva Council forums to 
say,

178
00:09:53,611 --> 00:09:54,444
good window for example.
Now let's look at a couple more 

179
00:09:57,031 --> 00:09:59,430
sentences and see what we find.
Here's the sentence,

180
00:09:59,431 --> 00:10:04,260
meaning the book will be published in 
five languages in Spanish and thinker,

181
00:10:04,890 --> 00:10:05,723
the almost word for word,
it's the book will be published in five 

182
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:15,410
languages,
and in Java Kunle word for word,

183
00:10:16,171 --> 00:10:20,700
it's the book verbal prefix come out in 
five language.

184
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:21,833
In this sentence,
we see that the subject comes first in 

185
00:10:23,641 --> 00:10:25,130
both sentences,
in Java,

186
00:10:25,131 --> 00:10:26,100
Connell,
Svo,

187
00:10:26,101 --> 00:10:28,230
word order is possible.
For example,

188
00:10:28,231 --> 00:10:29,064
it's often found a new stories that are 
translated from Spanish media keeping 

189
00:10:32,311 --> 00:10:35,010
the text as similar to the Spanish 
version as possible.

190
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:38,850
Another thing is that in Chicago there's
no passive form,

191
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:43,350
so passive meaning is understood from 
context or the action can be paraphrased

192
00:10:44,190 --> 00:10:46,890
in Spanish.
The sentence is explicitly future,

193
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:51,390
but the traveler Kennel sentence doesn't
have the future Prevar I it can have it,

194
00:10:51,391 --> 00:10:52,224
but here it doesn't.
We see here that the verb is proceeded 

195
00:10:54,721 --> 00:10:55,554
by mom.
Mom is a prefix that makes a verb 

196
00:10:57,980 --> 00:10:58,813
distributive,
meaning that the action is performed by 

197
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:04,170
several subjects or on several objects 
separately.

198
00:11:04,410 --> 00:11:05,243
Here,
the book will be released separately 

199
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:09,090
five different times in five different 
versions,

200
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:10,103
so money is used to show the 
distribution of the action among the 

201
00:11:13,051 --> 00:11:14,400
different releases of the book.

202
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:19,320
Mine is also a prefix that can be 
attached to nouns and English loan words

203
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:21,300
to turn them into travel.
Kennel verbs,

204
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:23,550
Mung translate,
Mon Picnic,

205
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:25,290
Monroe reply,
etc.

206
00:11:25,590 --> 00:11:26,423
There's a similar prefix mug into 
kellogg and visayan and notice that the 

207
00:11:30,421 --> 00:11:33,410
word for languages in spanish is easy 
omas,

208
00:11:33,690 --> 00:11:35,590
while in java condo it's lingala.
Hey,

209
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:36,780
in java,
connell,

210
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:37,703
and oTher languages of the Philippines,
lingua here is used to refer to 

211
00:11:40,501 --> 00:11:41,334
languages that are spoken by communities
of people while in spanish language 

212
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:47,400
refers more to the general concept of 
language,

213
00:11:47,550 --> 00:11:50,580
so to refer to a specific human language
and spanish.

214
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:54,490
Mom is the typical word and one last 
sentence.

215
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:58,240
This sentence means they left without 
paying for the drink in spanish,

216
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:01,110
so if we don't have either word for 
word,

217
00:12:01,111 --> 00:12:06,111
it's reflexive particle.
They went without pay the drink in java.

218
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:12,010
Candle light,
but gobbled nana word for word.

219
00:12:12,010 --> 00:12:14,260
It's past tense.
Pre-verbal leave.

220
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:18,220
They without pay object marker.
Definite article,

221
00:12:18,310 --> 00:12:19,143
alcoholic drink.
This last sentence is fairly different 

222
00:12:21,581 --> 00:12:23,470
from it.
Spanish equivalent first,

223
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:25,720
notice that the verbs are different.
in spanish,

224
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:29,170
we see the reflexive form of the verb.
Eod meaning to go.

225
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:31,480
The reflexive form is used to mean 
leave.

226
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:33,700
Java.
Camo doesn't have this construction,

227
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:37,150
so another verb has used.
Instead it's a derivative of the spanish

228
00:12:37,151 --> 00:12:39,220
word,
salyer meaning to go out.

229
00:12:39,570 --> 00:12:41,490
See,
la is the third person plural,

230
00:12:41,491 --> 00:12:44,680
subject pronouns,
which comes from tagalog and visayan.

231
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:47,910
Hawaii is a negative pre verb for the 
past tense.

232
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,780
Cornell is a combination of con,
the object marKer plus l,

233
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:54,840
the definite article.
Finally we have the word tomato,

234
00:12:54,870 --> 00:12:57,240
which means alcoholic drink in java 
candle.

235
00:12:57,330 --> 00:12:58,163
Well,
in spanish it's maybe the java candle 

236
00:12:59,851 --> 00:13:03,630
also has a similar word baby,
but that is a general word for a drink,

237
00:13:03,690 --> 00:13:05,610
not specifically an alcoholic drink.

238
00:13:06,430 --> 00:13:10,240
Before I mentioned that java was 
influenced by mexican spanish,

239
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:11,223
there was undoubtedly some influence on 
the pronunciation of mcconnell in 

240
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:15,093
travel.
Kennel also contains some vocabulary 

241
00:13:16,421 --> 00:13:19,360
that clearly came from mexican spanish,
for example,

242
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:20,313
psychotic meaning grass.
This is originally a word from now what 

243
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:24,083
to an indigenous language of Mexico.
It entered mexican spanish as a lone 

244
00:13:27,311 --> 00:13:30,370
word and then entered jaVa kennel via 
mexican spanish.

245
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:34,870
These words are also from now what'll 
John Gay meaning market which comes from

246
00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:35,823
young gay jungle,
meaning monkey from jungle and 

247
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:40,253
commentate meaning sweet potato.
There were other words and expressions 

248
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:45,023
that don't come from the wattle words,
but are common to Mexico and maybe have 

249
00:13:48,121 --> 00:13:50,580
special usage in Mexico.
In Mexico,

250
00:13:50,610 --> 00:13:51,443
when you want someone to repeat 
something because you didn't catch what 

251
00:13:53,551 --> 00:13:55,470
they said,
you ask monday.

252
00:13:55,980 --> 00:14:00,980
This is also used in java o'connell.
I also hear that a lot of swear words or

253
00:14:00,991 --> 00:14:04,200
of specifically mexican origin,
but I'll skip those for now.

254
00:14:04,950 --> 00:14:08,070
So our avocado and spanish mutually 
intelligible,

255
00:14:08,130 --> 00:14:09,450
well,
yes and no.

256
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:14,040
Some java speakers have told me that 
they can understand around 60 percent or

257
00:14:14,041 --> 00:14:17,730
more of certain varietieS of spanish in 
particular european,

258
00:14:17,731 --> 00:14:18,564
spanish and mexican spanish,
but this is not necessarily true fOr 

259
00:14:21,601 --> 00:14:23,640
spanish speakers who here java 
o'connell,

260
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:24,653
while most java connell speakers are 
familiar with the word order of english 

261
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,580
and maybe the word order of spanish 
itself.

262
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:33,660
Spanish speakers are generally not 
familiar with the word order of filipino

263
00:14:33,661 --> 00:14:37,130
languages like tagalog or scion,
so when they hear cheva condo,

264
00:14:37,170 --> 00:14:39,840
they might just hear a mishmash of 
spanish words,

265
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:43,080
but be confused by how they're being put
together in sentences.

266
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,273
This is especially true for informal 
travel condo which has more influence 

267
00:14:47,191 --> 00:14:51,320
from filipino languages where as formal 
travel economy is closer to spanish,

268
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:54,070
but probably with some basic exposure to
the grammar,

269
00:14:54,110 --> 00:14:56,600
they could improve their comprehension 
of it quite quickly.

270
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:57,913
Some people argue that [inaudible] 
really isn't that different from other 

271
00:15:00,471 --> 00:15:03,200
filipino languages like to gallo or 
scion,

272
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:06,130
which contain a lot of spanish 
vocabulary themselves.

273
00:15:06,310 --> 00:15:07,143
Java condo just has a lot more of it.
The question of the day for spanish 

274
00:15:10,611 --> 00:15:13,250
speakers,
how well can you understand java candle?

275
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:14,293
I'll leave a link to a video in the 
description for you to see before 

276
00:15:17,331 --> 00:15:20,350
commenting if you want,
and for java speakers,

277
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:24,470
how weLl can you understand spanish?
Does it depend on the variety of spanish

278
00:15:24,471 --> 00:15:26,930
or on the context?
Be sure to follow lang,

279
00:15:26,931 --> 00:15:28,640
focus on facebook,
twitter,

280
00:15:28,641 --> 00:15:29,474
and instagram,
especially instagram because it's the 

281
00:15:31,281 --> 00:15:32,690
coolest,
and once again,

282
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:35,510
I'd like to say thank you to all of my 
patreon supporters,

283
00:15:35,570 --> 00:15:36,403
especially these ones right here on the 
screen who are my top tier patrion 

284
00:15:39,681 --> 00:15:42,680
supporters.
Many tHanks to them and to you.

285
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:45,470
Thank you for watching and have a nice 
day.
