Hello everyone,
welcome to the Lange Focus Channel and 

2
00:00:03,021 --> 00:00:03,854
my name is Paul.
Today's topic is the Dutch language 

3
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:08,700
Dutch as a language that's spoken mainly
in Europe,

4
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:10,890
but also in a few other places around 
the world.

5
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:11,903
It has $23,
million native speakers and around $28 

6
00:00:14,731 --> 00:00:17,610
million speakers in total,
including second language speakers.

7
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:18,593
It is most widely spoken in the 
Netherlands where it has around $16 

8
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:22,073
million native speakers.
It has also spoken by around 60 percent 

9
00:00:24,331 --> 00:00:25,164
of the population of Belgium,
mostly in the northern region of 

10
00:00:27,301 --> 00:00:28,134
Flanders.
That's around six point $5 million 

11
00:00:29,641 --> 00:00:30,474
people.
It's also spoken by a small number of 

12
00:00:32,041 --> 00:00:34,110
people across the border in French 
Flanders,

13
00:00:34,111 --> 00:00:37,080
which lies adjacent to Belgium,
but only around 20,000

14
00:00:37,081 --> 00:00:39,660
people there still speak it on a regular
basis.

15
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:40,703
It has also spoken in the South American
nation of Suriname where it has around 

16
00:00:43,951 --> 00:00:44,784
350,000
native speakers as well as around 

17
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:48,090
$250,000.

18
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:48,923
Second language speakers.
It is also an official language on the 

19
00:00:50,941 --> 00:00:53,280
island of Aruba,
along with the language poppy,

20
00:00:53,281 --> 00:00:54,114
a mental,
but few of the hundred thousand people 

21
00:00:55,471 --> 00:00:58,290
that are actually used Dutch even though
they all learn it in school.

22
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:02,460
It has also spoken in Jira,
so where it is spoken by around 15,000

23
00:01:02,461 --> 00:01:06,180
people as a native language and by many 
of the other 140,000

24
00:01:06,181 --> 00:01:07,014
people as a second language.
It is also an official language in Sint 

25
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:10,673
Maarten along with English.
A couple of thousand people there speak 

26
00:01:12,481 --> 00:01:13,314
Dutch,
but English is actually much more 

27
00:01:14,191 --> 00:01:15,024
common.
There is also Afrikaans language spoken 

28
00:01:17,071 --> 00:01:17,904
in South Africa and Namibia,
which is a daughter language of Dutch 

29
00:01:20,401 --> 00:01:22,470
and is mutually intelligible to some 
extent,

30
00:01:22,471 --> 00:01:26,400
but I'll leave Africans out for now and 
I'll speak about it in a different video

31
00:01:26,401 --> 00:01:27,234
in the future.
Dutch as a member of the West dramatic 

32
00:01:28,981 --> 00:01:32,460
branch of the dramatic language family,
which also includes Afrikaans,

33
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:35,010
Friesian,
English and German among others.

34
00:01:35,210 --> 00:01:38,430
Dutch is one of the languages that is 
most closely related to English.

35
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:39,353
Actually,
Phrygian is more closely related to 

36
00:01:40,771 --> 00:01:41,730
English,
then Dutches,

37
00:01:41,731 --> 00:01:42,564
but Dutch is a close second and a lot of
people say that Dutch is quite similar 

38
00:01:45,481 --> 00:01:46,680
to German too.
In fact,

39
00:01:46,681 --> 00:01:50,220
some people say that Dutch lies 
somewhere between English and German.

40
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:52,350
Now,
that's not a very precise statement,

41
00:01:52,351 --> 00:01:55,440
but I think there is some truth to it.
The history of Dutch,

42
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:58,380
all dramatic language is developed from 
Provo Germanic,

43
00:01:58,381 --> 00:01:59,214
which was spoken around 500 bce in 
northern continental Europe and also in 

44
00:02:02,701 --> 00:02:03,534
Scandinavia by the second century ce.
It had begun diverging into distinct 

45
00:02:07,171 --> 00:02:08,004
northern western and eastern dialects.
The Western dialect is the ancestor of 

46
00:02:11,491 --> 00:02:13,890
Dutch and have all of the West Germanic 
languages.

47
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:16,320
Variation developed in the western 
dialects,

48
00:02:16,321 --> 00:02:17,154
but all of its varieties remained 
intelligible until around the eighth 

49
00:02:19,651 --> 00:02:20,484
century CE.
But by then a series of sound changes 

50
00:02:22,861 --> 00:02:25,350
had begun to take place that made old 
high German,

51
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:26,213
the ancestor of modern German,
much more distinct from the other 

52
00:02:28,411 --> 00:02:29,520
western manic languages.

53
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:31,650
For more information on German that it's
history,

54
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:35,070
check out my video on German,
right to hear old Dutch.

55
00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:35,963
Also known as old low Franconian 
remained unaffected by the changes that 

56
00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:41,160
affected old high German,
also unaffected.

57
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:43,590
We're old Saxon Bolt,
Friesian and old English,

58
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:47,220
but those languages underwent a 
different series of sound changes,

59
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:48,173
but again,
Dutch was mostly unaffected by these 

60
00:02:49,561 --> 00:02:53,880
changes to middle Dutch,
old Dutch developed into Middle Dutch,

61
00:02:53,881 --> 00:02:57,660
which was spoken and written between 
1150 and 1500 cd.

62
00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:58,733
It was a rich literary periods and 
literature from this time period is 

63
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:02,014
often quite readable for speakers of 
modern Dutch because Dutch is quite a 

64
00:03:04,841 --> 00:03:07,870
conservative language.
Middle Dutch developed into modern Dutch

65
00:03:07,871 --> 00:03:08,704
by the middle of the 16th century.
The process of the standardization of 

66
00:03:11,531 --> 00:03:12,364
Dutch began in the year 14,
77 at the end of the Middle Dutch 

67
00:03:15,191 --> 00:03:16,024
period.
The dialects of flenders and Brad bond 

68
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:19,210
were most influential at that time.

69
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:20,223
Then in the 16th century,
the move to standardization became 

70
00:03:22,421 --> 00:03:26,170
stronger with the end top dialect being 
the most influential in the year.

71
00:03:26,171 --> 00:03:27,460
16,
37,

72
00:03:27,490 --> 00:03:28,323
the first major Dutch Bible translation 
known as starts in and had been 

73
00:03:32,471 --> 00:03:33,304
published.
It hasn't been translated in such a way 

74
00:03:34,931 --> 00:03:37,930
that people from all over the country 
could read and understand it.

75
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:38,853
This Bible was read by nearly everyone 
and it helped greatly in the 

76
00:03:41,261 --> 00:03:43,690
standardization of Dutch,
the southern Netherlands.

77
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:46,750
Now Belgium and Luxembourg were separate
and under Spanish,

78
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:48,340
Austrian,
and then French rule.

79
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:51,190
More than half of the people in Belgium 
spoke a dialect of Dutch,

80
00:03:51,191 --> 00:03:54,220
but French was most widely used in 
public life in schools,

81
00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:55,063
etc.
So dutch remained unstandardized there 

82
00:03:57,011 --> 00:03:57,844
until the 19th century when the flemish 
movement started standing up for the 

83
00:04:00,671 --> 00:04:01,504
rights of dutch speakers.
They adopted the Same standard language 

84
00:04:04,061 --> 00:04:04,894
used in the Netherlands.
NowaDays in both the Netherlands and in 

85
00:04:07,211 --> 00:04:08,044
flanders,
the northern dutch speaking region of 

86
00:04:09,371 --> 00:04:09,850
Belgium.

87
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:10,683
The situation is similar.
There are a number of spoken varieties 

88
00:04:13,031 --> 00:04:13,864
of dutch as well as a standard language,
so the difference lies mainly in 

89
00:04:16,751 --> 00:04:19,900
pronunciation of standard dutch and in 
the local dialects used.

90
00:04:20,110 --> 00:04:20,943
The dialects of flenders tend to be more
conservative and use more older dutch 

91
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:25,870
vocabulary.
Regional languages.

92
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:26,853
There are dutch dialects,
but there are also different regional 

93
00:04:28,811 --> 00:04:32,320
languages that are west dramatic 
languages and closely related to dutch,

94
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:33,183
but not as closely related as the 
dialects that are considered part of 

95
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:36,553
dutch regional languages in the 
Netherlands include friction in the 

96
00:04:39,131 --> 00:04:42,340
northern province of friesland,
low saxon and the northeast,

97
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:43,233
and there are various dialects of low 
saxon and lindbergh ish or east low 

98
00:04:46,541 --> 00:04:51,490
franconia in the se lo saxon spreads 
across the border with Germany and forms

99
00:04:51,491 --> 00:04:54,100
part of a dialect continuum between 
dutch and german.

100
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:55,083
If you've seen my german video,
you know that the dialects in northern 

101
00:04:57,161 --> 00:04:57,994
Germany are referred to as low german 
and can be considered a separate 

102
00:05:00,461 --> 00:05:00,940
language.

103
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:01,773
The dutch low saxon dialects are closely
related to the low german dialects 

104
00:05:04,541 --> 00:05:06,970
across the border.
This is also true for linda borgess,

105
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:07,833
which is related to franconia and 
dialects spoken across the border in 

106
00:05:09,971 --> 00:05:10,804
Germany.
It should be noted that dutch dialects 

107
00:05:12,161 --> 00:05:12,994
and regional languages are in decline 
with standard dutch becoming more 

108
00:05:15,731 --> 00:05:16,564
widespread and with some people speaking
a kind of combination of standard dutch 

109
00:05:19,451 --> 00:05:22,300
with some dialectal features.
So what is dutch like?

110
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:24,730
Dutchess,
not mutually intelligible with english,

111
00:05:24,731 --> 00:05:25,564
but you will often notice cognitive 
vocabulary and at the most basic level 

112
00:05:28,601 --> 00:05:29,434
you will notice similar grammar.
If you disregard the details and just 

113
00:05:31,691 --> 00:05:32,524
look at the most basic sentences.
Occasionally there are sentences in 

114
00:05:34,931 --> 00:05:37,540
dutch that might be strangely familiar 
to english speakers.

115
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:40,060
For example of this year,
this means,

116
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:42,090
what is your name?
Man amish to duke.

117
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:45,420
This means my name is luke to beach,
drunk beach.

118
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:48,820
This one means the bear drank beer.
I think I must have gotten that one from

119
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,700
duolingo.
This neat fit.

120
00:05:50,890 --> 00:05:51,723
This means it is not far these news.
This means that is good news now at all 

121
00:05:57,090 --> 00:05:57,923
dutch sentences were so similar to 
english than the two languages could 

122
00:06:00,171 --> 00:06:02,450
probably be quite intelligible with each
other,

123
00:06:02,451 --> 00:06:05,150
but most sentences are not that similar 
to english,

124
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:07,490
but you will see a lot of cognitive 
vocabulary,

125
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:09,260
grammar,
similar to german,

126
00:06:09,261 --> 00:06:12,260
dutch as a language that places verbs at
the end of the sentence,

127
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,153
after the first initial group.
So it's underlying structure is 

128
00:06:15,171 --> 00:06:18,470
basically sov,
but the first verb is in second position

129
00:06:18,530 --> 00:06:19,363
after the subject.
So if there's only one verb in the 

130
00:06:20,991 --> 00:06:22,790
sentence,
then it's basically like svo.

131
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,820
Here's a sentence with one verb him 
belief.

132
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:28,400
This means I am writing a letter word by
word.

133
00:06:28,401 --> 00:06:29,234
This is like I write a letter just like 
english with the bourbon second 

134
00:06:32,691 --> 00:06:33,200
position.

135
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:36,350
Here's the sentence with two verbs.
He can fuel you have of liquors cave,

136
00:06:36,351 --> 00:06:39,710
and this means I want to give you some 
goodies word by word.

137
00:06:39,711 --> 00:06:44,150
It's I want you indirect object.
Some goodies give in the sentence.

138
00:06:44,151 --> 00:06:44,984
The first verb is in second position,
but the next verb comes at the end of 

139
00:06:47,871 --> 00:06:49,220
the sentence.
Nouns,

140
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:51,230
gender,
when it comes to gender,

141
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:53,840
dutch traditionally has three genders,
masculine,

142
00:06:53,841 --> 00:06:56,300
feminine and neuter.
But in modern spoken dutch,

143
00:06:56,330 --> 00:06:58,250
the distinction between masculine and 
feminine,

144
00:06:58,251 --> 00:06:59,084
gender has almost become irrelevant 
because they don't look or sound 

145
00:07:01,461 --> 00:07:03,860
different.
It used to determine which pronoun would

146
00:07:03,861 --> 00:07:06,980
be used to refer to those nouns,
whether it's he or she,

147
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:09,230
but people generally just use he these 
days.

148
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:11,420
So now the two genders are basically 
common.

149
00:07:11,421 --> 00:07:12,254
Gender and neuter,
the announced gender agrees with 

150
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:16,640
articles as well as the forms of 
adjectives,

151
00:07:17,090 --> 00:07:19,550
plural.
There are two types of neural endings in

152
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:21,070
dutch,
one is n,

153
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:23,330
and the other is yes,
there are some,

154
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:26,210
well not rules but patterns for when to 
use each one,

155
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,073
but there are a lot of exceptions,
so you have words like douche dude and 

156
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:36,250
votes bulletin and you have words like 
just little doodles,

157
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:40,790
the labels,
a few neuter nouns have a plural form.

158
00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:42,170
Irwin,
for example,

159
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:47,930
cases dutch used to have now in cases 
similar to german,

160
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:49,670
there were four cases,
nominative,

161
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:51,410
genitive,
dative and accusative.

162
00:07:51,530 --> 00:07:54,320
These were part of standard written 
dutch until the 19 forties,

163
00:07:54,321 --> 00:07:57,020
but they were dropped because nobody 
used them in speech anymore.

164
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:03,050
There are several different articles in 
dutch.

165
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:07,190
There is an indefinite article and and 
there are definite articles for singular

166
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:11,690
and plural nouns for singular masculine,
the for singular feminine,

167
00:08:12,010 --> 00:08:16,340
the for singular neuter head and the 
definite article for plural,

168
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:17,203
for all genders.
The an interesting thing is there is a 

169
00:08:19,821 --> 00:08:23,780
negative article came.
This is the same for all genders and for

170
00:08:23,781 --> 00:08:24,614
both singular and plural verbs.
There are two verb tenses in dutch past 

171
00:08:28,131 --> 00:08:31,340
and present or non past,
but saying there are two tenses.

172
00:08:31,341 --> 00:08:33,650
Is kind of misleading because similar to
an english,

173
00:08:33,651 --> 00:08:34,484
the verb can be used in combination with
different auxiliary verbs to express 

174
00:08:37,461 --> 00:08:38,294
different meanings,
and there are participle forms that can 

175
00:08:40,011 --> 00:08:42,430
be used to show a passive or continuous 
action.

176
00:08:42,650 --> 00:08:43,483
For example,
here's a sentence using the simple past 

177
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:50,650
had about this means he built a house.
So we start with the infinitive bowen,

178
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:54,590
and this is the verb stem,
and this is the past tense form boda.

179
00:08:55,490 --> 00:08:57,660
Now here's a perfect sentence.
Often,

180
00:08:57,810 --> 00:09:00,630
often boats,
this means he has built a house,

181
00:09:00,810 --> 00:09:04,140
so we start with the infinitive heaven 
and here's the verb stem,

182
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,153
and here's the past tense,
and the second verb is a past 

183
00:09:08,251 --> 00:09:09,084
participle.
This is formed by adding the prefix and 

184
00:09:11,431 --> 00:09:14,430
the suffix.
The notice again that the second verb is

185
00:09:14,431 --> 00:09:15,264
at the end of the sentence,
even though the first verb is in second 

186
00:09:17,491 --> 00:09:18,324
position after the subject,
there are three different ways to 

187
00:09:20,311 --> 00:09:21,144
express the future tense.
One of them is to use this auxiliary 

188
00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:24,203
verb.
This means something like shell or will 

189
00:09:26,770 --> 00:09:30,900
he had more than this sentence means I 
will do it tomorrow.

190
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:34,980
You can also use this verb meaning to go
plus the infinitive.

191
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:37,710
This is similar to using going to an 
english,

192
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:39,630
for example,
headscarf and eighth,

193
00:09:39,631 --> 00:09:40,464
and then this means it's going to rain 
and you can also use the present tense 

194
00:09:44,430 --> 00:09:46,800
for the future xy coleman per slot.

195
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:51,240
This means they won't come until later.
Literally they come only later,

196
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:55,440
so the verb system in dutch is rather 
similar to the one used in english.

197
00:09:55,441 --> 00:09:56,274
The main difference being that any verb 
after the first one comes at the end 

198
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:00,473
pronunciation,
one of the hardest parts of learning 

199
00:10:01,801 --> 00:10:02,634
dutch might be the pronunciation because
there are some sounds that can be a 

200
00:10:05,311 --> 00:10:06,144
challenge for learners and native 
speakers of dutch seem quite conscious 

201
00:10:08,671 --> 00:10:09,504
of the challenges we face.
That was kind of an indirect way of 

202
00:10:11,401 --> 00:10:13,410
saying they think our pronunciation 
sucks.

203
00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:17,130
Some of the sounds that require special 
effort are the dutch g sound,

204
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:21,390
for example,
and the sound which ch often represents.

205
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:22,253
For example,
notice that this is the same sound as 

206
00:10:24,751 --> 00:10:27,960
the one represented by ge,
but in other cases,

207
00:10:27,961 --> 00:10:30,330
ch represents the ship sound.
Now,

208
00:10:30,331 --> 00:10:32,460
sometimes those sounds come at the 
beginning of a word,

209
00:10:32,490 --> 00:10:33,323
which is a little bit of a challenge,
but sometimes they come right after the 

210
00:10:35,551 --> 00:10:38,430
letter s like in the word for school 
skol.

211
00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:40,980
The sound combination is quite common in
dutch.

212
00:10:41,070 --> 00:10:41,903
There are a lot of long words in dutch.
Some of them can be over 30 characters 

213
00:10:45,031 --> 00:10:47,250
long.
Here are a couple of extreme examples.

214
00:10:47,370 --> 00:10:49,470
Myhrvold persona,
the kite store,

215
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:50,313
nice.
This one means multiple personality 

216
00:10:51,991 --> 00:10:55,690
disorder and that is 35 characters long 
through it,

217
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:56,713
but adding reading some hayden plum.
This one means preparation activities 

218
00:10:59,581 --> 00:11:04,230
for our children's carnival procession 
and this is 53 characters long and dutch

219
00:11:04,231 --> 00:11:06,960
also has a lot of colorful idioms,
for example,

220
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:10,290
mocked up the guts.
This means make the cat wires.

221
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:11,333
This means that someone is saying 
something so outlandish or unbelievable 

222
00:11:13,981 --> 00:11:17,400
that even the cat won't believe it.
Another example of houston,

223
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:20,550
but indicator,
this means he has a beard in his throat.

224
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:25,080
This idiom describes a situation when a 
boy reaches puberty and his voice starts

225
00:11:25,081 --> 00:11:25,914
to change.
How hard is dutch to learn for english 

226
00:11:27,751 --> 00:11:28,110
speakers?

227
00:11:28,110 --> 00:11:31,230
A lot of dutch will seem strangely 
familiar and of course that will help,

228
00:11:31,231 --> 00:11:32,064
but there are some issues and learning 
the pronunciation as well as the finer 

229
00:11:34,531 --> 00:11:35,364
details of grammar,
but maybe the hardest thing about 

230
00:11:37,291 --> 00:11:40,860
learning dutch is that dutch speakers 
usually speak english very well,

231
00:11:40,861 --> 00:11:43,920
so it will be hard to practice.
When you try to speak dutch with people,

232
00:11:44,010 --> 00:11:47,760
they'll probably answer you in english,
but you can solve that problem by taking

233
00:11:47,761 --> 00:11:48,594
some lessons or doing a language 
exchange and practicing on your own 

234
00:11:50,851 --> 00:11:53,770
until you reach a fairly good level and 
have a fairly good base.

235
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:56,380
Then after that,
you can speak to people in dutch without

236
00:11:56,410 --> 00:11:57,580
totally pissing them off.

237
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:02,740
The question of the day.
For native speakers of dutch,

238
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:06,580
how well can you understand the speakers
have regional languages that are related

239
00:12:06,581 --> 00:12:09,340
to dutch languages like frisian or low 
saxon,

240
00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:10,383
and for people who have studied dutch,
what was your experience with trying to 

241
00:12:12,821 --> 00:12:15,070
learn and practice dutch?
How did people respond to you?

242
00:12:15,071 --> 00:12:15,904
Did they answer you in english?
What was the best way for you to learn 

243
00:12:18,161 --> 00:12:18,994
and practice dutch?
