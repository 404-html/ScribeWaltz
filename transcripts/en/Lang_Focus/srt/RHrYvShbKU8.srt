1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:05,060
Back by not so popular demand meaning 
about one third of my viewers love these

2
00:00:05,911 --> 00:00:08,130
videos and the other two thirds are 
like,

3
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:12,450
it's another episode of mystery 
languages.

4
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:13,673
I will give you some samples of a 
language and you have to guess what 

5
00:00:16,081 --> 00:00:16,914
language it is.
You might not be able to get the exact 

6
00:00:19,081 --> 00:00:19,914
language,
but maybe you'll be able to guess the 

7
00:00:21,091 --> 00:00:21,924
language family or the region or country
where that language is spoken or 

8
00:00:24,871 --> 00:00:25,704
something like that.
Just try to see how close you can get 

9
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:29,610
language number one,
please listen.

10
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:35,390
Sherry did see a movie.
I did some despite the rotarians.

11
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:40,750
Yeah I do my lesson but even this one 
more to me hit me.

12
00:00:41,830 --> 00:00:44,500
She Rung,
we lead poison.

13
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:49,730
Nobody can witness.
She should go going back.

14
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:56,780
Yaba [inaudible] and you know,
cause he,

15
00:00:57,971 --> 00:01:01,430
I did some Misha here wasn't,
it was cynical about very,

16
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:05,880
now let's see a written sample of that 
language.

17
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:20,830
So what language do you think it is?

18
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:28,453
The language is Yoruba.
Yoruba is a member of the Niger Congo 

19
00:01:31,731 --> 00:01:32,564
language family and is spoken in the 
west African countries of Nigeria and 

20
00:01:35,751 --> 00:01:39,740
Beneen as well as Togo.
It's an official language in Nigeria and

21
00:01:39,741 --> 00:01:42,320
to spoken by an estimated 30 million 
people.

22
00:01:42,470 --> 00:01:43,303
Current estimates are based on 
population growth since 1990 when 18 

23
00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:48,890
million people spoke it as a native 
language.

24
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:52,820
It's also the most widely spoken African
language outside of Africa,

25
00:01:52,850 --> 00:01:56,150
spoken by migrants around the world,
and that's excluding Arabic,

26
00:01:56,151 --> 00:01:58,550
which is not considered a native 
language of Africa.

27
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:01,730
You'll robot is primarily the language 
of the Yoruba people,

28
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:04,640
but not all Yoruba people speak the euro
by language.

29
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:09,140
Yoruba is a tonal language and each 
syllable has one of three tones,

30
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:09,921
high,
mid,

31
00:02:09,921 --> 00:02:11,960
or low.
And as I understand it,

32
00:02:11,961 --> 00:02:14,570
you can hear these three tones in the 
name of the language,

33
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:18,410
which is pronounced Yoda with a mid,
low and high tone.

34
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:20,630
I probably just slaughtered that 
pronunciation,

35
00:02:20,631 --> 00:02:22,700
but you get the idea.
There are three tones.

36
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:27,350
Another feature to notice is that Yoruba
syllables consist of a vowel,

37
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:28,393
a consonant,
followed by a vowel or a nasal sound 

38
00:02:30,621 --> 00:02:34,130
that functions as its own syllable.
There are no consonant clusters,

39
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:36,710
and in that regard,
it's similar to Japanese.

40
00:02:37,010 --> 00:02:38,840
All right,
let's look at another language.

41
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:39,763
Please listen.

42
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:42,380
[inaudible] oh this.
Oh,

43
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:47,253
[inaudible] [inaudible] know sending it.
You go tubing in a Nigga Ya Kay up in 

44
00:02:53,541 --> 00:02:55,740
the head on the hen to it.
Uh,

45
00:02:55,910 --> 00:02:56,721
and the Doh Doh,
Doh,

46
00:02:56,721 --> 00:02:57,554
Doh,
Doh,

47
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:02,950
Doh.
Just your don't need [inaudible] hillel.

48
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:04,170
Oh No.
Oh no,

49
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:07,080
because if we just say it's a buy 
nowadays.

50
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:12,210
[inaudible].

51
00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:18,210
Now let's see a written sample of this 
language now.

52
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:31,660
What language do you think it is?

53
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:39,143
The language is Navajo.
Navajo is a member of the southern 

54
00:03:42,361 --> 00:03:44,520
branch of the Athabaskan language 
family.

55
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:45,533
It's one of the most widely spoken 
native American languages with around 

56
00:03:48,331 --> 00:03:50,490
170,000
native speakers,

57
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:53,040
most of whom are bilingual and speak 
English as well.

58
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:56,820
The area where Navajo is spoken is in 
the southwestern United States,

59
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,020
principally in Arizona,
but also across the state borders in New

60
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:01,853
Mexico and Utah.
Navajo is a tonal language with four 

61
00:04:03,991 --> 00:04:06,780
tones.
Hi Lo rising and falling.

62
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:09,300
It has a large inventory of consonant 
sounds.

63
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:10,223
One example is a distinction between 
plan stops and fricatives and labial 

64
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:15,570
stops and fricking tips.
For example,

65
00:04:15,571 --> 00:04:18,170
there's the plane stop cut and there's 
the labor.

66
00:04:18,171 --> 00:04:21,450
You'll stop quit.
The difference is that the labial sounds

67
00:04:21,451 --> 00:04:26,451
include the rounding of the lips.
Another example is and whoa and end,

68
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:28,613
whoa,
these two sounds are sounds not used in 

69
00:04:31,891 --> 00:04:32,724
English,
and then we have the labial sounds as 

70
00:04:34,081 --> 00:04:34,914
well.
Those are just a few of the many sounds 

71
00:04:36,511 --> 00:04:37,530
of Navajo.
Okay.

72
00:04:37,531 --> 00:04:39,000
Time for the next language.

73
00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:40,503
What am I knew?
[inaudible] [inaudible] 

74
00:04:46,970 --> 00:04:47,803
[inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] have
to get on with summary or moving them 

75
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:57,663
cause some symptoms or what they want to
put you on [inaudible] because we put 

76
00:05:01,341 --> 00:05:04,270
down and sort of new car or domain.
How last point you had to show my money,

77
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:07,780
so he stood up to him and I've got a 
steak or something.

78
00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:09,680
I'd or quartermaine.
Yeah.

79
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,940
Now let's see a written sample.

80
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:20,633
Okay.

81
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:24,730
All right.
What language do you think it is?

82
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:33,490
It's the Hungarian language.
Hungarian is spoken by around 15 million

83
00:05:33,491 --> 00:05:35,260
people.
Most of them in Hungary,

84
00:05:35,290 --> 00:05:36,123
in central Europe,
but some live in neighboring Romania as 

85
00:05:38,741 --> 00:05:41,110
well as other nearby countries like 
Slovakia,

86
00:05:41,170 --> 00:05:42,790
Slovenia,
Austria,

87
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:44,140
Serbia,
Croatia,

88
00:05:44,170 --> 00:05:45,003
and Ukraine.
Hungarian is not an Indo European 

89
00:05:47,981 --> 00:05:48,814
language.
It's a member of the eugric branch of 

90
00:05:50,351 --> 00:05:54,040
the erotic language family.
One notable feature of Hungarian is that

91
00:05:54,041 --> 00:05:56,880
there are lots of germinated consonants,
germinated,

92
00:05:56,900 --> 00:06:00,110
meaning long consonants that are held 
longer than a short consonant.

93
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:03,950
These are represented in writing by 
double letters in the audio sample.

94
00:06:03,951 --> 00:06:04,784
You can hear this if you pay attention 
for a little pauses when the consonants 

95
00:06:07,431 --> 00:06:08,264
are linkedin.
Another notable feature is palatalized 

96
00:06:10,581 --> 00:06:14,220
consonants such as Chia.
Yeah,

97
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:16,853
and yeah,
and overly simple way of describing 

98
00:06:20,371 --> 00:06:21,204
these sounds is to say that they sounded
like the consonant followed by a year 

99
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:27,840
sound.
I hope you liked this episode of mystery

100
00:06:27,841 --> 00:06:28,674
languages.

102

one,

103
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:36,570
but with different languages.
