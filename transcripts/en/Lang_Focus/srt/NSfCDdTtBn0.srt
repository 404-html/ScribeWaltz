00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:10,080
Hello everyone and welcome to the lange 
focus channel.

5
00:00:10,081 --> 00:00:10,914
My name is Paul.
Today I am going to talk about the 

6
00:00:12,781 --> 00:00:15,090
Spanish language.
As you may know,

7
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:18,150
Spain has more than one language,
so when I say Spanish,

8
00:00:18,151 --> 00:00:20,790
I'm referring specifically to Castilian 
Spanish,

9
00:00:20,791 --> 00:00:21,624
which is spoken as a native language by 
74% of the people of Spain and 99% of 

10
00:00:26,461 --> 00:00:29,040
the people of span including second 
language speaker.

11
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:33,510
Castilian is the Spanish language that 
grew to become one of the most important

12
00:00:33,511 --> 00:00:34,344
global languages during this video.
I might refer to it as Castilian to 

13
00:00:37,771 --> 00:00:39,960
contrast it with other languages of 
Spain,

14
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:44,430
but usually I'll refer to it as Spanish.
Out of all languages in the world,

15
00:00:44,431 --> 00:00:45,264
Spanish has the second largest number of
native speakers with 470 million native 

16
00:00:49,471 --> 00:00:53,670
speakers as well as another 90 million 
who speak it as a second language.

17
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:58,050
It is also one of the most widely 
dispersed languages with 44 countries of

18
00:00:58,051 --> 00:01:01,620
the world having at least 3 million 
native speakers of Spanish or more.

19
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:02,693
It is one of the six official languages 
of the UN as well as an official 

20
00:01:05,491 --> 00:01:06,324
language of the European Union.
It is also an official language of 21 

21
00:01:09,811 --> 00:01:11,760
countries.
If we include Puerto Rico,

22
00:01:11,761 --> 00:01:12,594
which is a territory of the US.
It also used to be an official language 

23
00:01:16,051 --> 00:01:18,370
of the Philippines,
but it is not any more.

24
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:22,830
Spanish is also the third most widely 
used language on the Internet.

25
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:24,810
According to one source that I 
consulted,

26
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:29,040
the use of Spanish online has grown by 
800% in the past few years.

27
00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:30,123
Spanish is a member of the Barrow 
Romance Subfamily of the Romance 

28
00:01:33,031 --> 00:01:36,360
Language family.
Other members of that sub family include

29
00:01:36,361 --> 00:01:39,290
Portuguese galicians and some people say
Katelyn,

30
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:43,110
like all romance languages.
Spanish developed from Vulgar Latin,

31
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:46,560
the spoken Latin that was brought to the
area by the Roman Empire.

32
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:47,573
Vulgar Latin evolved into numerous 
regional dialects which eventually 

33
00:01:50,431 --> 00:01:53,460
became distinct enough to be considered 
different languages.

34
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:54,533
There are documents from the ninth 
century that are written in an early 

35
00:01:56,731 --> 00:02:01,170
form of Castilian Spanish or we could 
say a late form of vulgar Latin.

36
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:02,363
In any case,
documents like these show that the 

37
00:02:03,691 --> 00:02:06,660
vulgar Latin dialects were becoming 
separate languages.

38
00:02:06,661 --> 00:02:07,494
By that point,
Castilian Spanish is the language that 

39
00:02:09,301 --> 00:02:10,134
our role is in the north central region 
of the Berrien Peninsula called Castiel 

40
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:16,860
and it grew more and more distinct from 
its neighbor language Leo needs.

41
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:18,083
It became firmly established as a 
distinct language in the 13th century 

42
00:02:21,271 --> 00:02:22,104
when King I'll funds,
oh decided to standardize the written 

43
00:02:24,001 --> 00:02:28,050
language for official use based on the 
dialect spoken in Toledo.

44
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:29,123
It process,
which continued for a few hundred years 

45
00:02:30,721 --> 00:02:31,554
until the 16th century in the 13 
hundreds of the southern part of the 

46
00:02:34,681 --> 00:02:35,514
Iberian peninsula was under the control 
of al and the loose a Muslim controlled 

47
00:02:38,671 --> 00:02:42,960
territory that had previously controlled
most of the peninsula that Econ Kista,

48
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:43,853
which means the reconquest resulted in 
the retaking of the Muslim areas and of 

49
00:02:47,791 --> 00:02:50,280
the spread of Castilian Spanish to the 
south.

50
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:53,040
There it was influenced by the most 
Arabic dialects.

51
00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:57,540
Those were romanced dialects spoken by 
Muslims in Alanda loose that contained a

52
00:02:57,541 --> 00:02:58,374
lot of loan words from Arabic castilian 
Spanish absorbed a lot of those Arabic 

53
00:03:01,841 --> 00:03:02,674
loan words up to 4,000
words or 8% of the modern languages 

54
00:03:05,921 --> 00:03:06,754
vocabulary.
Some common Spanish words of Arabic 

55
00:03:08,531 --> 00:03:09,364
origin are Asda,
which means until that comes from the 

56
00:03:12,461 --> 00:03:15,850
Arabic word Hata with the same meaning 
or law,

57
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,620
which means I hope comes from the Arabic
word low shalla or in Shell law,

58
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:23,260
which means if it's God's will,
a set day,

59
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:27,910
which means oil as in olive oil comes 
from the Arabic word as it with the same

60
00:03:27,911 --> 00:03:28,744
meaning.
There were also a lot of words in 

61
00:03:29,651 --> 00:03:34,000
Spanish that begin with Aal out,
which is the Arabic definite article.

62
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:37,480
For example,
alcohol from the Arabic word alcohol,

63
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:40,560
which of course means alcohol and 
alcohol day,

64
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:43,050
which means mayor comes from the Arabic 
word,

65
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:45,790
alcohol d,
which means judge in Arabic.

66
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:46,923
That's just a couple of examples,
but there are lots of words beginning 

67
00:03:48,941 --> 00:03:49,774
with AOL in Spanish.
The Christian reconquest of the South 

68
00:03:52,511 --> 00:03:55,900
successfully ended in 1492 and that very
same year,

69
00:03:55,901 --> 00:03:59,680
Spain began sending explorers like 
Christopher Columbus abroad to build the

70
00:03:59,681 --> 00:04:00,514
Spanish empire,
the Spanish language spread along with 

71
00:04:02,561 --> 00:04:05,740
the Empire to the Americas,
to the Spanish east indies,

72
00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:09,070
which includes present day Philippines 
and to some parts of Africa.

73
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,320
One area it spread to us,
Mexico,

74
00:04:11,321 --> 00:04:12,154
which today has the largest Spanish 
speaking population of any country with 

75
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:15,813
120 million speakers of Spanish.
The variety of Spanish spoken in Mexico 

76
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:20,523
varies somewhat from the variety spoken 
in Spain and that's true for the other 

77
00:04:23,831 --> 00:04:24,664
Spanish speaking countries as well.
The standard written language is 

78
00:04:27,131 --> 00:04:27,964
basically the same everywhere,
but the spoken language has some 

79
00:04:30,011 --> 00:04:30,844
differences,
especially in pronunciation and in 

80
00:04:32,741 --> 00:04:37,060
vocabulary and especially in common 
daily vocabulary like clothing,

81
00:04:37,061 --> 00:04:38,380
food and things like that.

82
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,393
In Latin America,
various native languages influenced the 

83
00:04:41,591 --> 00:04:42,424
different local varieties of Spanish.
What's the best variety of Spanish to 

84
00:04:45,341 --> 00:04:46,270
learn?
Well,

85
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:48,790
the varieties are often categorized into
European,

86
00:04:48,791 --> 00:04:52,300
Spanish and Latin American Spanish.
From what I understand,

87
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:54,640
there isn't a lot of difference for 
beginners.

88
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:55,773
No matter which variety you'll learn,
you will be able to adapt to other 

89
00:04:58,301 --> 00:05:00,670
varieties quite easily.
Personally,

90
00:05:00,671 --> 00:05:04,070
I've met more Spanish speakers from 
Mexico than from any other country.

91
00:05:04,071 --> 00:05:04,904
So for me that's the natural choice.
But for you it depends on which variety 

92
00:05:08,351 --> 00:05:11,470
you are most likely to use and which one
you're most interested in.

93
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:12,903
Like romance languages in general,
Spanish shares a lot of vocabulary with 

94
00:05:15,821 --> 00:05:17,860
English,
not identical vocabulary,

95
00:05:17,861 --> 00:05:18,694
but related vocabulary that you can 
figure out and you can more easily 

96
00:05:21,881 --> 00:05:25,270
remember if you associate it with the 
related English words.

97
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:27,430
Let's take a look at a couple of 
sentences.

98
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:31,030
Cuanto Cuesta when via Nueva York.
Okay,

99
00:05:31,031 --> 00:05:34,120
so the first word Quanto that sounds to 
me like quantity.

100
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:37,060
So I think it means how much because 
this is a question.

101
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,100
The next word,
Cuesta.

102
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:41,530
Well,
I think that probably means cost.

103
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,710
The next word I know that means,
ah,

104
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:46,140
the indefinite article,
the next word via.

105
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:50,080
Well that looks like voyage to me or 
voyage in French.

106
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:53,800
So I think it means a voyage or a trip.
And then I know means to,

107
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,810
and Nueva York,
of course,

108
00:05:55,811 --> 00:05:59,360
that means New York.
So I think means how much does a trip to

109
00:05:59,361 --> 00:06:01,790
New York costs if we translate it 
literally,

110
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:02,983
how much costs a trip to New York.
Another sentence [inaudible] to say no 

111
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:11,840
to movies.
So let's look at it word by word L.

112
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:14,820
I know that means the definite article 
on bread.

113
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:16,910
That's a word I know from movies and 
stuff.

114
00:06:16,911 --> 00:06:20,270
I think that means if men come to say,
well,

115
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:22,460
I'm not sure,
let's come back to that one in a second.

116
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:22,800
[inaudible]

117
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:26,540
is up and I would do movie.
That means automobile car.

118
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:30,560
So go back to come to say,
well maybe that means conduct.

119
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:33,230
Or in this case you don't conduct an 
automobile,

120
00:06:33,231 --> 00:06:34,064
you drive an automobile.
So this means the man drives an 

121
00:06:36,711 --> 00:06:39,860
automobile or demand drives a car.
So you can see that.

122
00:06:39,861 --> 00:06:41,750
You can figure out what those words 
mean.

123
00:06:41,751 --> 00:06:43,700
If you look at each word and analyze 
them.

124
00:06:43,701 --> 00:06:46,280
It's not always that easy.
But that's an easy example.

125
00:06:46,281 --> 00:06:47,114
So you know what I mean?
And also if we look at the syntax of 

126
00:06:49,071 --> 00:06:49,904
those sentences,
we can see that they're very similar to 

127
00:06:51,231 --> 00:06:53,090
English.
So the first sentence again,

128
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:56,010
Quanto Questa in via a on Nueva York.
Um,

129
00:06:56,120 --> 00:07:00,470
so how much costs a trip to New York?
So quite similar to English,

130
00:07:00,471 --> 00:07:03,110
but just sort of simplified the next 
sentence.

131
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:07,550
The man drives a car.
That one is word by word,

132
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:09,170
exactly the same as English.

133
00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:10,003
So it's translatable directly.
Of course the grammar gets more 

134
00:07:12,561 --> 00:07:13,394
complicated than that.
But just the most basic syntax is very 

135
00:07:15,651 --> 00:07:16,484
similar to English.
So this is one of the benefits of 

136
00:07:18,471 --> 00:07:20,870
learning a romance language for English 
speakers.

137
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:23,540
According to the American Foreign 
Service Institute,

138
00:07:23,541 --> 00:07:27,950
Spanish is a category one language that 
means that relatively speaking it is one

139
00:07:27,951 --> 00:07:30,650
of the easier languages for native 
English speakers to learn.

140
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:31,813
So what are you waiting for and then 
some Spaniel or should I say 

141
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:35,383
[inaudible]?
I'm not sure because Spanish speakers 

142
00:07:37,431 --> 00:07:39,500
themselves can't actually agree on this 
issue.

143
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:43,120
In the red colored countries,
the preferred term is custody ended,

144
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:45,800
the blue colored countries,
the preferred term is espanol.

145
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:46,993
And in Spain you can see that there is 
some disagreement about which term is 

146
00:07:49,611 --> 00:07:52,490
best.
If you're a native speaker of Spanish,

147
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:53,353
maybe you can tell us what you think 
about that in the comments down below 

148
00:07:56,150 --> 00:07:58,340
and other people you can leave your
