1
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:05,530
And No,

2
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:17,440
good afternoon everyone,
it's a nice sunny Sunday afternoon,

3
00:00:17,441 --> 00:00:20,350
so I decided to get out of my house,
get out of the apartment,

4
00:00:20,530 --> 00:00:24,160
come outside in the sun to the partner,
my video here.

5
00:00:24,490 --> 00:00:25,323
So today I want to talk about one of the
more popular or talked about language 

6
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:33,880
programs or series of language programs 
out there and it's called Michel Thomas.

7
00:00:33,910 --> 00:00:36,250
I've used to have the Michel Thomas 
Programs.

8
00:00:36,251 --> 00:00:39,520
I've used Michelle Thomas French and 
Michelle Thomas Arabic,

9
00:00:39,550 --> 00:00:42,370
which is Egyptian Arabic by the way,
if you wanted to know.

10
00:00:42,790 --> 00:00:44,890
Um,
and I'm just going to give my review,

11
00:00:44,891 --> 00:00:47,740
my impression based on my experiences 
with it.

12
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:50,170
Now for each of them.
I did the basic course,

13
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:53,740
the advanced course and the vocabulary 
builder course.

14
00:00:53,741 --> 00:00:56,740
I've done all three for both of those 
languages.

15
00:00:57,670 --> 00:00:58,503
The names are not really accurate.
I don't think any of the advanced ones 

16
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:04,690
are really advanced.
I think it's more like introductory part

17
00:01:04,691 --> 00:01:05,524
one,
introductory part two and more 

18
00:01:07,721 --> 00:01:08,980
introductory vocabulary.

19
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,980
That's what I would rename them to.
I'll get more into that later.

20
00:01:11,981 --> 00:01:12,814
But basically Michelle Thomas is an 
accelerated learning program and 

21
00:01:18,311 --> 00:01:20,740
accelerated learning style.
His,

22
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:22,360
his big thing,
Michelle Thomas,

23
00:01:22,361 --> 00:01:25,720
his big thing is an absence of stress 
when you're learning,

24
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:29,440
there should be no stress and no feeling
of responsibility for your own learning.

25
00:01:29,810 --> 00:01:30,643
The responsibility for your learning 
rests with the teachers so you're 

26
00:01:33,641 --> 00:01:34,474
supposed to feel very relaxed when 
you're learning and that puts you in a 

27
00:01:36,941 --> 00:01:39,760
better state for learning efficient 
route,

28
00:01:39,970 --> 00:01:40,803
which is something I agree with.
I tried to use that in my teaching as 

29
00:01:43,091 --> 00:01:43,924
much as possible.
Try to make the students feel relaxed 

30
00:01:45,911 --> 00:01:50,170
and feel that there's no pressure upon 
them to learn something.

31
00:01:50,171 --> 00:01:54,310
They're not ready to learn all of that.
So that's part of his methodology is the

32
00:01:54,311 --> 00:01:55,144
lack of the absence of stress in the 
absence of responsibility and when he's 

33
00:01:59,741 --> 00:02:01,420
teaching,
he's kind of meditative.

34
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:04,420
Like you can hear on the cds when you 
listen to it.

35
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:06,040
Mr Thomas himself,
he's,

36
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:06,953
he's,
he's very relaxed and I think he is 

37
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:08,913
consciously meditating and that's 
supposed to relax the listener and the 

38
00:02:11,621 --> 00:02:13,630
students.
So that's just something I noticed.

39
00:02:13,631 --> 00:02:14,464
I can't guarantee that,
but that's what I feel when I listened 

40
00:02:17,231 --> 00:02:18,064
to it.
The guy himself is meditating when he's 

41
00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:22,450
teaching the course that's supposed to 
transfer to you,

42
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,640
the listener.
So there's that part.

43
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:25,743
Another thing,
another element of the accelerated 

44
00:02:27,971 --> 00:02:28,804
learning is that he teaches the language
in an order where everything that's 

45
00:02:32,231 --> 00:02:34,870
taught is connected to what's taught 
next.

46
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:37,660
Everything is a building block is 
teaching you a small piece.

47
00:02:37,810 --> 00:02:40,690
Then he teaches you another piece on top
of that and another piece,

48
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:41,733
and then you're building progressively 
more difficult sentences as he does 

49
00:02:44,741 --> 00:02:46,570
that.
And the way he does it.

50
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:47,880
It's just very,
um,

51
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,610
it's,
it's just very easy to learn,

52
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:52,743
easy to learn each piece,
and he does a good job of connecting 

53
00:02:55,151 --> 00:02:55,984
them and explaining them and using some 
mnemonics to help you remember in that 

54
00:02:59,050 --> 00:02:59,883
kind of thing.

55
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:03,100
It's also a very teacher centered 
approach.

56
00:03:03,101 --> 00:03:03,934
So the teacher is always directly 
engaged with you and telling you what 

57
00:03:08,050 --> 00:03:11,110
sentence to produce.
So there's no free practice,

58
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:15,910
like basically current methodology of 
language teaching is you,

59
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,880
you teach the language and then you have
some,

60
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:18,833
some exercises to practice the language 
structures and after that there's some 

61
00:03:21,341 --> 00:03:22,174
kind of free practice.
Like somebody will ask you a question 

62
00:03:24,581 --> 00:03:25,414
and you have to respond freely from the 
things you've learned without being 

63
00:03:28,481 --> 00:03:31,090
prompted,
without being reminded what to say,

64
00:03:31,330 --> 00:03:33,880
so at some stage you are producing the 
language freely,

65
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:36,580
but in the Michelle Thomas programs,
there's none of that.

66
00:03:36,581 --> 00:03:37,414
It's all controlled practice,
which means that you're learning a lot 

67
00:03:39,611 --> 00:03:40,444
of structures kind of quickly,
but you're not given the opportunity to 

68
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:45,963
produce them freely.
What I think of it is the way he set it 

69
00:03:49,061 --> 00:03:52,660
up as like a very sheltered environment 
for learning that language.

70
00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:54,310
If you're not supposed to do any 
homework,

71
00:03:54,311 --> 00:03:57,220
you're not supposed to use any other 
materials.

72
00:03:57,221 --> 00:04:00,790
You're only supposed to rely on him for 
all of the learning.

73
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:03,153
So the positives of this accelerated 
learning method are that you feel very 

74
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:08,673
encouraged.
You feel very encouraged and motivated 

75
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:14,170
because it's set up in a way that you 
never feel that you're failing.

76
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:17,800
You always feel like you've succeeded.
You're not allowed to fail in the method

77
00:04:17,801 --> 00:04:19,210
really.
And if you make a mistake,

78
00:04:19,211 --> 00:04:22,660
he corrects you right on the spot and 
you're supposed to fix it immediately.

79
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:27,220
So you always finish every moment of the
lesson feeling successful,

80
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:30,550
so that's kind of,
it's meant to encourage you and meant to

81
00:04:30,551 --> 00:04:35,530
keep you in that ideal learning state,
which is good for what it is,

82
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:41,050
but it can be negative and in a way part
of the feeling of that,

83
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:41,893
the feeling constantly encouraged to 
feeling nothing but success all the 

84
00:04:45,431 --> 00:04:46,000
time.

85
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:46,833
It makes people sometimes feel kind of 
invincible and it makes them delude 

86
00:04:50,621 --> 00:04:51,454
themselves into thinking that they're 
really good at the language when 

87
00:04:53,921 --> 00:04:56,560
actually they're still a really low 
beginners.

88
00:04:56,561 --> 00:05:00,130
So that's kind of part of the danger of 
the Michelle Thomas method.

89
00:05:00,131 --> 00:05:00,964
You can go online and you can read some 
people's reviews of the method and you 

90
00:05:03,851 --> 00:05:05,740
look on Amazon.
Some people are saying,

91
00:05:05,741 --> 00:05:06,574
wow,
I'm fluent after five hours and things 

92
00:05:08,621 --> 00:05:09,454
like that.
And you think,

93
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:10,151
no,
you're not.

94
00:05:10,151 --> 00:05:11,610
Come on.
That's just a,

95
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:15,730
a kind of self delusion.
And I guess just people get,

96
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:17,110
what's the word?
Um,

97
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,033
it's kind of euphoria I would say from 
just that feeling of success makes 

98
00:05:21,491 --> 00:05:22,324
people really excited.
And that's good if you are thinking of 

99
00:05:25,181 --> 00:05:27,190
it realistically,
if you know from the start,

100
00:05:27,191 --> 00:05:29,110
okay,
this is an introductory course.

101
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:33,160
I don't expect to be fluent from this.
I know that's impossible.

102
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:35,290
If you have that realistic attitude in 
mind,

103
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:36,423
then that sense of euphoria is good 
because it motivates you to keep 

104
00:05:39,251 --> 00:05:43,900
studying and to to get some more 
materials and keep going with it so it's

105
00:05:43,901 --> 00:05:44,734
good.
Just don't fall into that trap of 

106
00:05:45,971 --> 00:05:46,804
thinking you know more than you do 
because the danger of learning in that 

107
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:53,470
really sheltered environment where you 
feel nothing but success,

108
00:05:53,471 --> 00:05:56,770
nothing but relaxed kind of confidence 
with the language.

109
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:57,793
When you get outside of that into the 
real world and you try to communicate 

110
00:06:00,321 --> 00:06:01,154
with a native speaker and you don't 
understand anything and you can't 

111
00:06:03,831 --> 00:06:04,664
remember how to make a sentence and you 
can't remember the vocabulary you 

112
00:06:07,491 --> 00:06:10,040
learned in that Michelle Thomas 
sheltered box,

113
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:13,030
then you're going to feel discouraged,
right?

114
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:15,440
If you're not expecting that.
So that's.

115
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:19,460
That's like I mentioned before,
you don't get any experience interacting

116
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:21,830
in the Michelle Thomas Program.

117
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:26,390
You don't learn how to respond to 
anything that is said unexpectedly.

118
00:06:26,391 --> 00:06:28,490
You don't learn how to accomplish a 
task.

119
00:06:28,491 --> 00:06:32,000
You don't learn how to paraphrase or say
things you don't know how to say yet.

120
00:06:32,001 --> 00:06:34,940
It's always just you say something.
You already know how to say.

121
00:06:34,941 --> 00:06:35,774
You say exactly what the teacher tells 
you to controlled for you to be able to 

122
00:06:38,931 --> 00:06:39,764
transfer that into conversations with 
native speakers so it it's good for 

123
00:06:44,031 --> 00:06:44,864
getting one very basic thing down,
which is the sentence structure of the 

124
00:06:47,931 --> 00:06:50,480
language.
You get the sentence structure and basic

125
00:06:50,481 --> 00:06:51,314
vocabulary so you can make sentences,
but the harder part of becoming 

126
00:06:56,600 --> 00:07:00,200
proficient in a language is interaction 
and communication.

127
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:02,360
Unless you just want to type some 
sentences,

128
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:05,780
unless you just want to write sentences 
and you as an exercise,

129
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:06,913
then you need to interact.
So that's the part that's really the 

130
00:07:09,501 --> 00:07:10,334
challenge and it could cause a lot of 
discouragement if you are not prepared 

131
00:07:15,921 --> 00:07:16,754
for that.
Just focusing on the Michelle Thomas 

132
00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:21,830
language style of learning.
Okay,

133
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:24,230
so with all that said,
I think Michel Thomas.
