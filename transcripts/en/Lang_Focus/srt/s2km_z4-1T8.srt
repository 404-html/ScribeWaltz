Hello everyone.
Welcome to the Internet and my name is 

2
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:09,060
today we're going to look at the 
differences between Chinese and Chinese.

3
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:11,063
Well,
what I mean is we'll be looking at two 

4
00:00:12,661 --> 00:00:16,230
of the many Chinese languages,
Mandarin and Cantonese.

5
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:20,670
As I mentioned in my video on Chinese.
Chinese is not a single language,

6
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:21,533
but rather a number of dialect groups 
that are united by a common writing 

7
00:00:24,901 --> 00:00:25,734
system.
The spoken languages are different and 

8
00:00:27,661 --> 00:00:28,494
generally mutually unintelligible,
which is definitely the case with 

9
00:00:31,141 --> 00:00:31,974
Mandarin and Cantonese,
which are both Semitic languages or 

10
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:39,500
Chinese languages spoken in China.
Mandarin is spoken by 960 million native

11
00:00:40,021 --> 00:00:42,120
speakers,
mainly in the north of China,

12
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:43,133
but as now used all over mainland China 
and Taiwan as the official language of 

13
00:00:46,381 --> 00:00:48,150
government,
media and education,

14
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:51,510
and it's one of the four official 
languages of Singapore as well.

15
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:57,380
Cantonese on the other hand is spoken by
50 to 60 million native speakers in Hong

16
00:00:57,420 --> 00:00:58,253
Kong.
Macau go on zillow and some adjacent 

17
00:00:59,791 --> 00:01:03,420
areas as well as in Chinese diaspora 
communities around the world.

18
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:06,600
It's part of the wider UAA branch of 
Chinese.

19
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:08,520
Before we get into the main room.
