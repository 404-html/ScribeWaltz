00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:04,320
An English speaking Canadian,
speaking about Hebrew in Japanese,

2
00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:10,610
what the fuck is up with that?
How are you doing today guys?

3
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:17,880
This is a video that I've filmed for a 
different channel,

4
00:00:17,881 --> 00:00:19,440
a Japanese channel.
Uh,

5
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:22,530
it's a video about the Hebrew language,
but it's in Japanese.

6
00:00:22,531 --> 00:00:23,364
So it might seem strange to hear me 
talking about the Hebrew language in 

7
00:00:26,821 --> 00:00:30,630
Japanese since I'm neither a native 
speaker of Japanese or Hebrew,

8
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:34,170
but this was for a Japanese audience on 
another channel.

9
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,890
But rather than recreate this whole 
video in English,

10
00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:39,660
I wanted to just put subtitles on it so 
you can check it.
