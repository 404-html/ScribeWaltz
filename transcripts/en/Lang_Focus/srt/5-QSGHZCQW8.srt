1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:01,590
Mickey,
I don't know what to do.

2
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:05,040
I really need my viewers to think that 
I'm amazing with languages.

3
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:07,860
I'm really not,
but I need them to think that,

4
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:21,280
well,
I don't need their validation,

5
00:00:21,281 --> 00:00:24,190
but they're always asking me if I am a 
super polyglot,

6
00:00:24,191 --> 00:00:25,990
like all those people selling ebooks,

7
00:00:34,610 --> 00:00:36,450
but how do I get rid of attachments,

8
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:44,690
but I might fail.

9
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,153
Hello language enthusiasts.
Today I'm going to play the great 

10
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:02,920
language game.
This idea is totally original.

11
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:05,720
I didn't get this idea from Pewdiepie or
Jack's,

12
00:01:05,721 --> 00:01:07,230
but I see.
No,

13
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:08,073
I had this idea of long before them in 
this game I'll hear some samples of 

14
00:01:11,561 --> 00:01:14,800
languages and I will have to guess what 
languages they are.

15
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:15,903
At the end of the game I'll get a score 
that reflects my ability to guests the 

16
00:01:18,881 --> 00:01:19,714
languages.
This is kind of like the mystery 

17
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:24,910
languages videos that I've made,
like these ones right here,

18
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:28,060
except that I'll be guessing the 
languages instead of you,

19
00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:32,350
so I'm ready to fail and embarrass 
myself for your entertainment.

20
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:35,410
Let's go.
Alright,

21
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:38,740
here it is the great language game.
I'm clicking play right?

22
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:39,633
No,

23
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:45,780
anecdotally what I want you in and when 
I go,

24
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:47,973
no meter.

25
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:50,940
She the sound quality.
Get any worse

26
00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:00,190
Spanish?
Yes.

27
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,280
You got it.
Okay.

28
00:02:01,370 --> 00:02:02,240
That wasn't too hard.

29
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:04,650
Okay,
cool.

30
00:02:04,650 --> 00:02:07,450
Cool.
Choreograph production assistant.

31
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:12,770
So for just two boys,
the boys were either three,

32
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:14,380
but see Miss Tula.

33
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:16,710
Um,
this one's finished.

34
00:02:17,290 --> 00:02:20,110
I really don't know the sounds of 
finished that well,

35
00:02:20,111 --> 00:02:22,180
but it wasn't there a big.
It wasn't Chinese,

36
00:02:22,181 --> 00:02:24,940
it wasn't Vietnamese.
So by process of elimination,

37
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:26,020
I know it's finished.

38
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:28,300
You got it.
Okay.

39
00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:33,570
And Do,
do you know kids?

40
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:38,440
You took me back.
They didn't tell him you got to.

41
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,480
Okay.
So this is Korean?

42
00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:44,010
I don't speak Korean,
but I hear Korea,

43
00:02:44,011 --> 00:02:44,771
Korean,
a fair bit.

44
00:02:44,771 --> 00:02:47,140
Living here in Japan there are a lot of 
Korean visitors,

45
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:49,960
so I know a few words and I know the 
sounds of Korean.

46
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:51,453
That's this one.

47
00:02:52,270 --> 00:02:53,103
Okay.

48
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:59,480
Just to you or sample boning a

49
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:00,843
state called the police and Eliade punt 
on the ombuds business on my Monterrey 

50
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,280
there or something.

51
00:03:08,570 --> 00:03:11,010
It sounds like Norwegian,
like it's this one.

52
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:12,830
Nice.
Okay.

53
00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:18,450
You're happy but as duty.
Who is the police?

54
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:23,600
Negotiate.
But I a bar.

55
00:03:25,210 --> 00:03:27,090
Okay,
this one is not Vietnamese.

56
00:03:27,091 --> 00:03:28,830
It's not Polish.
It's not Korean,

57
00:03:28,831 --> 00:03:32,020
so it's either Hindi or my ruthy.
I'm,

58
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,113
I'm not sure which one,
but I'm just going to go with Hindi 

59
00:03:36,691 --> 00:03:38,580
because that's the only one I've really 
heard.

60
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,170
I've heard Matthew A.
Little bit,

61
00:03:40,171 --> 00:03:42,510
but not really.
And you got it.

62
00:03:42,511 --> 00:03:43,344
Okay.

63
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:46,833
Yeah.
Need little school called for and Steve 

64
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:54,930
some stains so we go through a Yada,
Yada.

65
00:03:56,220 --> 00:04:01,220
Adam as some the data,
the less of a need.

66
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,510
Yeah,
sounds like Norwegian to me.

67
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:11,910
Nice.
Okay.

68
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,260
We heard that one before.

69
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:16,413
That gives you love those to,
to and foremost we give so much of it 

70
00:04:21,170 --> 00:04:26,170
but it's still a lot.
But will he will go strongly coupe.

71
00:04:26,971 --> 00:04:31,971
What do you think of the blue?
What would you know post in the group?

72
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:37,750
Hmm.
Well the sound Slavic to me,

73
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:38,673
but it doesn't sound Russian.
I don't know specifically what the 

74
00:04:42,251 --> 00:04:43,084
difference is,
but I've never really encountered much 

75
00:04:46,031 --> 00:04:48,880
Polish so I'm going to say Polish 
because it sounds Slavic,

76
00:04:48,881 --> 00:04:51,100
but not rushing to me.
It could be wrong.

77
00:04:51,101 --> 00:04:54,500
Let's see.
It was Russian.

78
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:55,373
What do you know

79
00:04:57,110 --> 00:05:00,260
if at the moment this was the motiva?

80
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:03,773
Okay,
well that one's pretty easy because I'm 

81
00:05:04,951 --> 00:05:07,830
studying Italian,
so I hear it quite a lot.

82
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:10,790
Italian?
Yes.

83
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:11,720
Okay,
good.

84
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:12,760
Good for you.
Good.

85
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:14,390
We'll build the oil.
Thenthe.

86
00:05:15,530 --> 00:05:17,550
Hooshball.
Saville Blair's social listening.

87
00:05:18,770 --> 00:05:20,570
Okay,
so that one is Portuguese.

88
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:24,680
So I heard some romance vocabulary in 
there that I recognized even though I've

89
00:05:24,681 --> 00:05:28,280
never studied Portuguese.
You got it all right.

90
00:05:29,850 --> 00:05:30,683
Yeah.
Come.

91
00:05:30,690 --> 00:05:34,350
Yeah,

92
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:37,550

95
00:05:41,570 --> 00:05:44,640
similarly for that bank and me combined 
until.

96
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:46,880
Okay.
I think this is Vietnamese,

97
00:05:46,910 --> 00:05:47,743
my hair,
some tones in there and I'd been to 

98
00:05:49,071 --> 00:05:50,930
Vietnam and I've heard the language 
before.

99
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:53,600
I think that's the one.
All these others.

100
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:56,180
None of these other ones have tones as 
far as I know.

101
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,273
Here we go.
Good

102
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:04,180
adult talking to your leader there,
but it still took a second to.

103
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:11,940
Makes students found that would get.
I keep getting shit that you can get you

104
00:06:13,781 --> 00:06:14,614
off the cuff.
Fumbled Nigga to the lesson and 

105
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:18,290
telephone that he'd been with the 
village.

106
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:21,200
And let me hear this again.

107
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:24,610
Adult Adhd.

108
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:29,220
You smack is going to be as North Korea.
They stole them.

109
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:32,663
Um,
I don't know what this language here is 

110
00:06:33,910 --> 00:06:34,743
or septic,
but it doesn't sound like any of the 

111
00:06:38,021 --> 00:06:39,940
others to me.
So I'm going to choose that one.

112
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,360
MMM.

113
00:06:43,650 --> 00:06:45,390
Turkish.
Sorry.

114
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:48,060
Okay.

115
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:51,070

His gift to you move distally means good

116
00:06:51,150 --> 00:06:51,983

Your heart can swallow or know some 

117
00:06:54,241 --> 00:06:55,074
hills.
Oh yeah.

118
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:59,800
Mr Fadley,

119
00:07:00,030 --> 00:07:01,970
So distal to you.
Have you.

120
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,900
Have you helped over the,
of your portfolio at still the most?

121
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:08,010
Sydney?
Yes.

122
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:12,130
I don't understand what the hell they're
saying.

123
00:07:12,131 --> 00:07:15,310
So I think it's Danish.
You got it.

124
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,440
Alright.
Okay.

125
00:07:21,470 --> 00:07:22,480
Turn that down.

126
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:29,263
Sure.

127
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:36,350
How can they indicate some book?
I teach you how much he took.

128
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:42,960
Hey.
Hey.

129
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:43,920
Give me more.
Come on.

130
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:48,460
Okay.
Did they indicate some book?

131
00:07:48,461 --> 00:07:50,810
I teach you good bunker sammy.
But in the door Heidi,

132
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:52,933
I heard something about Boko Haram.
It doesn't sound like Chinese doesn't 

133
00:07:55,581 --> 00:07:59,300
sound like Norwegian or Polish or 
Spanish or Ukrainian.

134
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:01,660
I don't know about Uzbek.
Uh,

135
00:08:01,730 --> 00:08:04,370
but because of the content,
I think it's Hausa.

136
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:06,501
Nice.
Okay,

137
00:08:06,501 --> 00:08:07,334
good.

138
00:08:07,710 --> 00:08:10,600
Your bond k video on it.
There's no law.

139
00:08:10,670 --> 00:08:15,670
You the team's leader more by emotional 
particular mesh with the law here,

140
00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:20,240
leaving made as I was starting to get 
pretty close to Manila.

141
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:21,093
Nash rapists that some are religious 
will show a monitor bunco routed for a 

142
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:27,720
more beating their really believed 
process throughout.

143
00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:29,360
Okay.

144
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:32,330
Yes.
I believe there's no law.

145
00:08:32,331 --> 00:08:37,331
You mean by emotional and particularly 
the mashers law here.

146
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:40,490
Alyssa,
you made as I was starting to get pretty

147
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:41,333
close.

148
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:43,553
The sound's definitely slavic to me,
but I'm not sure if it's Russian or 

149
00:08:47,111 --> 00:08:49,310
Ukrainian.
Um,

150
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:50,253
let's see.
I'm going to pick Ukrainian kind of a 

151
00:08:53,411 --> 00:08:56,750
crap shoot.
You got it?

152
00:08:56,751 --> 00:08:57,820
Yes.
All right.

153
00:08:59,810 --> 00:09:00,643
Luck of the draw.

154
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:03,510
What do you will.
You are not my cause.

155
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:05,080
Yo.
Would you want more door?

156
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:06,260
No.
One to another.

157
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:09,250
See what a d.
f who you.

158
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:12,560
Because you hop up.
My mom did you know lucky

159
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:18,380
Bossy Cmi.
Moya at sweeter but accidentally.

160
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:23,480
Hmm.
Okay.

161
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:26,840
I think that once Swahili,
it doesn't sound like any of the others.

162
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:30,350
And something about the tone bursts.
Sounded Swahili to me.

163
00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:32,300
Yes.

164
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:33,133
Oh,
right.

165
00:09:33,970 --> 00:09:35,710
Got It.
Next

166
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:44,550
that I am as they do that.
Also a human that I watched Steve.

167
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,430
Lovely.
It was a big stone.

168
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:53,280
The COC mass shootings.

169
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:55,450
Who I'm getting tired.
I have to focus.

170
00:09:55,510 --> 00:09:56,343
Okay.

171
00:09:58,870 --> 00:10:03,870
Steve was big on the COC.
Mass shooting goes,

172
00:10:06,530 --> 00:10:08,030
a capitation went out of their mouths.

173
00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:11,400
Okay.
Um,

174
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:17,680
I think it's Uzbek mainly because it 
doesn't sound like any of the others.

175
00:10:18,171 --> 00:10:22,850
And some of the pronunciation sounded 
like it had Russian influence and I know

176
00:10:22,851 --> 00:10:25,880
that it was Becca.
Stan has been influenced by Russia.

177
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:28,800
So let's say it was bag.
Yes.

178
00:10:28,850 --> 00:10:30,120
All right.
That was right.

179
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:33,750
I've only got one life left.
This is nerve rattling.

180
00:10:34,970 --> 00:10:39,970
Newer Kumba be slamming state.
No secret was Sunni initially out of the

181
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:46,380
way there on Cassini might not even need
but the dod.

182
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:50,450
I think this is why he be again.

183
00:10:51,690 --> 00:10:52,360
Yes.

184
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,140
Okay.
Some,

185
00:10:54,310 --> 00:10:55,143
I heard some words that sounded like 
they were borrowed from Arabic and 

186
00:10:57,221 --> 00:10:58,054
they've retained the Arabic 
pronunciation and I know that's why he 

187
00:11:00,711 --> 00:11:03,340
really has some Arabic words.
So that helped me to guest

188
00:11:04,190 --> 00:11:07,450
who's coming in to spend.
They need me.

189
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,330
Japan's could do my Baltimore.

190
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:11,260
Okay.
That was French.

191
00:11:11,261 --> 00:11:12,160
I know some French,

192
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:14,820
yes.
Okay.

193
00:11:15,090 --> 00:11:15,923
What's next?

194
00:11:17,190 --> 00:11:22,190
It almost always eat breakfast.
Anything hit Hitler chosen this way or

195
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:26,590
have embedded of temperature in being 
available today in the.

196
00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:29,110
Cool.
I need to focus.

197
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,720
Every time I get one right.
That kind of relaxed and I think.

198
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:32,201
Oh,
okay.

199
00:11:32,201 --> 00:11:36,190
Now I can stop focusing,
but I need to think about the next one.

200
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:37,900
Okay.
Wake up Paul.

201
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:38,860
Wake up.
Focus.

202
00:11:38,970 --> 00:11:39,803
So Christina,
do you like these directly to them as 

203
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:44,213
possible for me,
a place in another state when he's been 

204
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:48,573
eating.
I think it's Danish again because I 

205
00:11:50,161 --> 00:11:51,540
don't understand what they're talking 
about.

206
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:53,513
Correct.

207
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:56,740
Whenever I have no idea what any of the 
words are.

208
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:59,590
It's Danish.
That's because of the porridge and their

209
00:11:59,591 --> 00:12:01,540
mouth porridge in the throat.

210
00:12:04,170 --> 00:12:09,170
She was from the court that she have 
not.

211
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:12,400
Oh,
we plugged that in.

212
00:12:12,510 --> 00:12:15,670
British new sophistication students

213
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:23,070
you said,
but I'm going to play that again because

214
00:12:26,931 --> 00:12:27,764
I couldn't that

215
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:28,983
I get it up to the court that she was 
not delta that British because now they 

216
00:12:37,370 --> 00:12:42,320
made it so far as you said.

217
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:50,240
Well that sounds Slavic against me.
Russian or this one.

218
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:50,840
Oh,
ascetic.

219
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:53,450
Which must be a slavic language.
Which one?

220
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:54,410
Eeny.
Meeny.

221
00:12:54,411 --> 00:12:55,280
Miny.
Moe.

222
00:12:55,281 --> 00:12:58,700
Catch a tiger by the toe.
Russians.

223
00:12:58,701 --> 00:13:00,140
More common.
Go with that.

224
00:13:00,970 --> 00:13:02,180
You got it.
Okay.

225
00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:04,940
I gotta look into this language or 
setting.

226
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:05,833
I don't know what it is.
I'll probably get a lot of comments 

227
00:13:08,121 --> 00:13:10,490
telling me what you don't know what it 
is,

228
00:13:10,491 --> 00:13:15,491
but I don't God to the sound quality.
Get any worse.

229
00:13:29,871 --> 00:13:32,480
Come on.
Find some clear samples

230
00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:37,343
or the.
For the year I've been fuzzy on me with 

231
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:54,640
our and now we have a lot of my youth.

232
00:13:55,950 --> 00:14:00,900
Do you think it's authentic this time?
You got it.

233
00:14:00,901 --> 00:14:01,980
Okay.
Alright.

234
00:14:16,650 --> 00:14:21,650
Okay.
Let me play that again.

235
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:37,440
That's why he the again.

236
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:39,780
Mm.

237
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:41,360
No.
What was it?

238
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:42,980
Hindi.
Whoops.

239
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:44,133
Okay.
I heard some words that sounded like 

240
00:14:45,531 --> 00:14:48,260
Arabic to me,
so I thought they were Swahili words.

241
00:14:48,261 --> 00:14:51,530
I guess Hindi has some words like that 
too.

242
00:14:52,130 --> 00:14:52,821
Well,
there it is.

243
00:14:52,821 --> 00:14:56,120
My score is 950.
See,

244
00:14:56,121 --> 00:14:58,670
my knowledge of languages is not 
perfect.

245
00:14:58,910 --> 00:14:59,743
Sometimes it's a guessing game and I'm 
just looking for little pieces that I 

246
00:15:02,391 --> 00:15:04,610
can analyze and try to figure out what's
going on.

247
00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:08,330
Even if I'm not sure,
I hope you enjoyed this video and I also
