Hello everyone,
welcome to the focus channel and my name

2
00:00:03,661 --> 00:00:04,471
is Paul.
Today.

3
00:00:04,471 --> 00:00:07,290
Rather than get into a new indepth 
language documentary,

4
00:00:07,291 --> 00:00:10,440
I decided to do a fun little video that 
we can do together.

5
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:11,513
I want to give you a challenge.
I want to present you with some mystery 

6
00:00:14,131 --> 00:00:18,390
languages and you can listen and look at
those languages and guess what languages

7
00:00:18,391 --> 00:00:22,350
they are,
but don't worry,

8
00:00:22,351 --> 00:00:24,390
even if you don't guess the language 
correctly,

9
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:25,313
it'll still be interesting as long as 
you share the reasons for your guesses 

10
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:30,240
in the comments down below.
So let's give it a try.

11
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:32,010
Here's the first language.
Please listen

12
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:39,550
almost as good as get back because they 
know me when I just to put in the sweat,

13
00:00:44,590 --> 00:00:49,590
did look in the dark with some of the 
what is it,

14
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:56,090
what we see as they go,
really?

15
00:00:57,220 --> 00:00:59,290
Okay,
and let me also show you a little bit of

16
00:00:59,291 --> 00:01:02,020
that language in its written form.
I don't speak this language,

17
00:01:02,021 --> 00:01:06,880
but I'll try to read it as best I can 
gamble and he went back up.

18
00:01:08,770 --> 00:01:10,120
So what language is it?

19
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:21,140
The language is Haitian creole.
If you're a French speaker,

20
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,033
then right away you might have known 
that this was Haitian creole and other 

21
00:01:24,291 --> 00:01:25,124
people,
you might have noticed some words that 

22
00:01:26,181 --> 00:01:28,460
sounded French,
but sounded a little different.

23
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:29,533
That's because the Haitian creole 
language is a French based creole 

24
00:01:32,241 --> 00:01:33,074
language.
It arose in the 17th and 18th centuries 

25
00:01:35,211 --> 00:01:36,044
because of interaction between French 
settlers and African slaves in the area 

26
00:01:39,201 --> 00:01:40,034
that is now called Haiti.
The majority of its vocabulary derives 

27
00:01:43,431 --> 00:01:44,264
from French,
but the majority of its syntax to rise 

28
00:01:46,281 --> 00:01:48,560
from the African languages spoken by the
slips.

29
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:51,620
Let's go back to those two examples 
sentences for a second game.

30
00:01:51,621 --> 00:01:52,454
Mooney valley.
This means is there a person here who 

31
00:01:55,041 --> 00:01:55,874
speaks English?
The beginning of the sentence doesn't 

32
00:01:57,561 --> 00:02:00,980
really seem French means to have or 
there is.

33
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:03,500
It might derive from the French word gun
yet,

34
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:04,573
but the way it's used as quite different
from the French word and moon means 

35
00:02:07,011 --> 00:02:12,011
person and I don't know the origin of 
this word is it is like in French,

36
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:14,810
in French.

37
00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:16,650
The whole sentence I guess would be 
India,

38
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:17,600
calc one,
Siki,

39
00:02:17,601 --> 00:02:21,580
Pat Langley.
The second sentence went back up.

40
00:02:21,581 --> 00:02:22,414
Ballet,
I'm.

41
00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:26,420
This means I can't speak English when it
comes from one in French.

42
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:27,643
Pop is the French negation marker.
Pop Cup comes from the French couple 

43
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:35,870
color pallet's partly so the vocabulary 
has all kinds of French,

44
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:36,733
but in French it would be like this.
You shouldn't sweep back a public park 

45
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:39,793
Langley,
so obviously the grammar is very 

46
00:02:41,211 --> 00:02:43,730
different even though the vocabulary is 
French based.

47
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:47,630
Notice that in the French sentence,
why is not used but is used.

48
00:02:47,890 --> 00:02:50,240
That's because in French was the object 
Pronoun.

49
00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:54,320
Wells is the subject.
Pronouns in Haitian creole went is both.

50
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:55,273
Now I'm breaking down these sentences 
just to show you that Haitian creole is 

51
00:02:57,501 --> 00:02:59,980
a combination of French and other 
influences.

52
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:00,903
To learn more about creole languages,
check out my video on pigeons and 

53
00:03:03,161 --> 00:03:05,350
creoles right here.
Okay,

54
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,300
onto the next language.
Please listen.

55
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:13,240
Like William helped because it gave me a
this quarter.

56
00:03:15,230 --> 00:03:20,230
What am I going to be challenged by?
Volley ball,

57
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:22,463
volleyball,
petroleum and Yoko needs or glade 

58
00:03:24,410 --> 00:03:25,243
helper.
You only have moved the number from the 

59
00:03:27,291 --> 00:03:29,870
leaders from and that's why the egg 
before for sure.

60
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:30,713
Look,

61
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:32,343
and again,
let me show you a little bit of that 

62
00:03:33,221 --> 00:03:34,450
language in its written form,

63
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:35,683
Bene in Esl scene and more shoots in 
streatham clear at all and now he dot 

64
00:03:47,990 --> 00:03:52,310
from on his phone on him.
Nor were they.

65
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:54,293
So what language is it?
The language is Phrygian specifically 

66
00:04:00,051 --> 00:04:00,884
West Virginia West Division has spoken 
in a northern province of the 

67
00:04:03,441 --> 00:04:04,274
Netherlands called friesland.
Freshmen is thought to be the language 

68
00:04:07,431 --> 00:04:08,264
that is most closely related to English.
Now it doesn't mean that it's easy for 

69
00:04:11,301 --> 00:04:14,660
English speakers to understand friction 
when I hear it or when I try to read it,

70
00:04:14,661 --> 00:04:15,494
I barely understand anything but it is 
closely related to English and its 

71
00:04:18,021 --> 00:04:20,930
historical development and in the 
structure of the language.

72
00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:22,880
All right,
let's do one last language.

73
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:23,893
Please listen.

74
00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:28,970
Like is it just pulls out that.
So it goes under the Jamaican guy.

75
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:40,750
So I've been buying for Bella so I'd be 
there about budget dry.

76
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:43,533
And again,
let's look at a couple of phrases 

77
00:04:44,501 --> 00:04:46,450
visually.
Now I don't speak this language,

78
00:04:46,451 --> 00:04:48,280
but I'll try to read these as best I 
can.

79
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:52,030
Knowing comprendo nonfatal suicide to do
meet this bloody boo.

80
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:53,950
So what language is it?

81
00:04:57,510 --> 00:04:58,343
Well,
if you know a romance language than you 

82
00:04:59,551 --> 00:05:03,300
probably noticed right away that this is
definitely another romance language.

83
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:04,253
It is actually the Sardinian language,
which is spoken on the island of 

84
00:05:06,541 --> 00:05:07,374
Sardinia in Italy.
It is one of many regional languages in 

85
00:05:09,811 --> 00:05:12,600
Italy that are often mistakenly referred
to as dialects,

86
00:05:12,601 --> 00:05:13,434
but they're actually separate languages.
Most of them are closely related to 

87
00:05:16,111 --> 00:05:16,944
Italian,
but they are different enough to be 

88
00:05:18,001 --> 00:05:19,530
considered different languages.
Well,

89
00:05:19,531 --> 00:05:23,100
I hope you enjoyed guessing today's 
mystery languages even if you didn't get

90
00:05:23,101 --> 00:05:24,000
them right.
That's okay.

91
00:05:24,001 --> 00:05:24,834
It should be interesting to share your 
reasons in the comments down below and 

92
00:05:27,001 --> 00:05:27,834
that should spark some interesting 
discussion and if you would like to see 

93
00:05:29,941 --> 00:05:32,630
more mystery language videos like this 
sometime in the future,

94
00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:34,260
then let me know and I might do it 
again.
