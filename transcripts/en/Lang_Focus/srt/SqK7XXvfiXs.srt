Hello everyone.
My name is Paul and I'm from Canada.

2
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:13,500
Oh Shit.
Yeah.

3
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:20,543
Hello everyone.
Welcome to the Lange Focus Channel and 

4
00:00:22,411 --> 00:00:26,130
my name is Paul.
Today we'll be going way back to see how

5
00:00:26,131 --> 00:00:27,900
we're all connected.
Well,

6
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:30,180
not all of us,
but about half of us.

7
00:00:30,270 --> 00:00:31,103
Around 46% of the people on Earth speak 
an Indo European language as their 

8
00:00:34,891 --> 00:00:37,470
native language throughout Europe,
South Asia,

9
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:38,333
the Americas and beyond.
The Indo European language family 

10
00:00:40,921 --> 00:00:43,380
contains languages as diverse as 
English,

11
00:00:43,381 --> 00:00:44,550
Hindi,
Persian,

12
00:00:44,551 --> 00:00:45,690
Russian,
Armenian,

13
00:00:45,691 --> 00:00:46,524
and Greek languages,
which on the surface may seem to have 

14
00:00:48,961 --> 00:00:49,794
nothing in common,
but they actually do all Indo European 

15
00:00:52,531 --> 00:00:55,440
languages developed from Prodo Indo 
European.

16
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:56,363
According to the most widely accepted 
theory prodo Indo European was spoken 

17
00:00:59,521 --> 00:01:00,354
around 6,500
years ago on the Eurasian Steppe of 

18
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,830
eastern Ukraine,
southern Russia,

19
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:05,693
and the Caucasus.
The Indo Europeans were the first or 

20
00:01:07,921 --> 00:01:10,530
among the first people to domesticate 
horses,

21
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:11,393
which greatly increased their ability to
travel and migrate over the following 

22
00:01:15,331 --> 00:01:16,290
three Millennia.

23
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:19,050
Indo European people migrated far and 
wide,

24
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:19,943
conquering new lands on horseback and 
bringing their language with them as it 

25
00:01:23,011 --> 00:01:23,844
developed into different varieties,
which eventually grew into different 

26
00:01:26,491 --> 00:01:28,890
branches of the Indo European language 
family.

27
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,560
The Indo Europeans first migrated into 
Europe,

28
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,180
Anatolia,
and Central Asia.

29
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,193
Then later into northern India and Iran.
As migration continued deeper into 

30
00:01:37,471 --> 00:01:38,304
Europe and Central Asia.
There's an alternate theory based more 

31
00:01:41,311 --> 00:01:42,144
on archeological evidence that suggests 
that the Indo European languages began 

32
00:01:45,781 --> 00:01:49,860
in Anatolia several thousand years 
earlier and spread with the expansion of

33
00:01:49,861 --> 00:01:50,694
agriculture.
There are no written records of Prodo 

34
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:56,970
Indo European and it's early offshoots,
so the best we can do is to theorize and

35
00:01:57,030 --> 00:01:57,863
imagine.
However they happened to take place 

36
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:00,443
during these migrations,
Prodo Indo European split into numerous 

37
00:02:03,241 --> 00:02:07,110
different languages which would 
gradually developed into entire branches

38
00:02:07,111 --> 00:02:11,070
of the Indo European language family.
Those branches are and a Anatolian,

39
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:13,320
which is now extinct,
tow Korean,

40
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:17,670
which is also extinct Italia and Celtic,
which may share a common he tello,

41
00:02:17,671 --> 00:02:20,190
Celtic ancestor,
Armenian and Albanian,

42
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:23,220
which each consists of just one language
as far as we know,

43
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:25,440
Hellenic Germanic,
Balto,

44
00:02:25,441 --> 00:02:26,274
Slavic,
which split into the Baltic and Slavic 

45
00:02:28,111 --> 00:02:28,944
branches and into Iranian,
which split into the ironic and indic 

46
00:02:31,921 --> 00:02:32,754
branches.

47
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,073
All of these branches and their 
individual languages have been 

48
00:02:35,971 --> 00:02:36,804
developing in different regions with 
different influences for thousands of 

49
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:41,730
years,
so they are now very different from each

50
00:02:41,731 --> 00:02:44,040
other,
but through comparative study we can see

51
00:02:44,041 --> 00:02:44,874
that Indo European languages share a 
common word stock as well as some 

52
00:02:47,701 --> 00:02:48,534
phonetic.
Again,

53
00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:51,270
historically speaking,
some grammatical tendencies.

54
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:52,223
There are a significant number of 
cognitive words in Indo European 

55
00:02:54,661 --> 00:02:55,980
languages.
By the way,

56
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:58,890
the word cognate comes from Latin 
[inaudible],

57
00:02:58,990 --> 00:03:02,680
which means born together.
These words were indeed born together in

58
00:03:02,681 --> 00:03:03,514
Prato Indo Europeans,
and if we're aware of the sound changes 

59
00:03:05,801 --> 00:03:08,380
that have taken place,
we can identify cognates.

60
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:11,470
For instance,
the word meaning bear or carry.

61
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,870
In Sanskrit,
it's the hod.

62
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:15,880
In Greek,
it's pad.

63
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,073
In modern Greek.
This might be pronounced like an f 

64
00:03:18,491 --> 00:03:19,324
sound,
but in ancient Greek it was actually an 

65
00:03:20,861 --> 00:03:23,590
aspirated pup sound.
In Latin,

66
00:03:23,591 --> 00:03:26,220
it's fed in Gothic,
it's by it.

67
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:28,240
In old English,
it's bad.

68
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:31,540
They all come from Prodo Indo European 
by head,

69
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:34,960
and my pronunciation of these different 
languages is probably not perfect,

70
00:03:34,961 --> 00:03:35,794
but I'm just giving it a shot myself.
I should point out that the Prodo Indo 

71
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:39,903
European words are theoretical 
reconstructions and that there's no way 

72
00:03:42,191 --> 00:03:44,110
of knowing for sure what they sounded 
like,

73
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:46,600
but these words here are fairly 
recognizable.

74
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:49,030
Some are a little less recognizable.
In English,

75
00:03:49,031 --> 00:03:51,910
we have the word work,
which comes from old English.

76
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:53,800
We had a,
and in modern Greek,

77
00:03:53,801 --> 00:03:58,801
the word for work is edit goal,
which was Aragon in ancient Greek and in

78
00:03:58,871 --> 00:04:01,700
some texts there was an alternate form 
whether gone,

79
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:04,840
they both stem from the pro Indo 
European word,

80
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:09,790
wedding film Indo European languages can
be divided into two classes,

81
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:12,550
the chem tomb languages and the sultan 
languages.

82
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:15,610
[inaudible] is the word for 100 in 
Avastin,

83
00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:17,320
an ancient Iranian language.

84
00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:22,210
Centum is the word for 100 in Latin.
These two words illustrate a sound shift

85
00:04:22,211 --> 00:04:24,250
that occurred in Indo European 
languages.

86
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:29,110
Prodo Indo European had a palatalized k 
sound that was distinct from the regular

87
00:04:29,111 --> 00:04:29,944
vilar k sound,
a palatalized consonant sounds kind of 

88
00:04:32,291 --> 00:04:33,124
like it's followed by a y sound like 
cure as opposed to cook in the Septum 

89
00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:37,923
languages.
This palatalized sound remained a 

90
00:04:39,941 --> 00:04:44,941
separate phoneme from cup and it became 
a civil and sound like a sub or a show.

91
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:50,670
So the Prodo Indo European word for 100 
cutone became Chatam in Sanskrit,

92
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:54,940
Shim Taz in Lithuanian,
and in many Slavic languages.

93
00:04:54,941 --> 00:04:55,774
It's stole.
These words have all developed and 

94
00:04:57,881 --> 00:04:58,714
diverged quite a bit.
But if you're aware of the sound shift 

95
00:05:00,701 --> 00:05:01,534
from a k sound to an s sound,
you can recognize these cognates more 

96
00:05:04,361 --> 00:05:08,170
easily in the Ken tomb languages.
The twoK sounds merged together,

97
00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:11,740
or in the case of the dramatic branch 
shifted to an h sound.

98
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:12,783
So cute.
Tome became centum in Latin and hey 

99
00:05:15,841 --> 00:05:20,530
catone in Greek cunt in Welsh and honed 
in old English.

100
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:24,910
So let's take a look at these two words.
In English hundred and sent,

101
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:25,893
we usually think of hundred as a native 
Germanic word and sent as a lone word 

102
00:05:29,261 --> 00:05:31,510
from Latin,
but these are actually cognitive.

103
00:05:31,570 --> 00:05:32,403
First,
let's take away the ending of the word 

104
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,470
ribbed,
which comes from a suffix,

105
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:40,150
meaning count or number that let's 
change the h back to a k and now you can

106
00:05:40,151 --> 00:05:42,910
kind of see the resemblance.
See the resemblance.

107
00:05:42,970 --> 00:05:46,600
Remember that the sea in insent was 
originally pronounced like a k,

108
00:05:46,810 --> 00:05:48,580
Cook and Latin.
Also,

109
00:05:48,581 --> 00:05:51,520
remember that d is the voice equivalent 
of tea,

110
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:55,000
so you can often see these sounds 
alternating and related languages.

111
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:56,853
Some core words have been preserved in 
many or even all Indo European 

112
00:05:59,751 --> 00:06:01,880
languages.
These include some animals.

113
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,260
For example,
Prodo Indo,

114
00:06:03,261 --> 00:06:05,960
European equals.
This means horse.

115
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,750
You know that equestrian animal in 
Latin,

116
00:06:08,751 --> 00:06:11,000
it's equis.
In ancient Greek,

117
00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:13,550
it was keep us.
In Sanskrit,

118
00:06:13,551 --> 00:06:14,384
it's Ashford and in Persian it's aspect.
The Latin and Greek examples are to him 

119
00:06:18,741 --> 00:06:19,574
examples,
but in Greek it seems that the k sound 

120
00:06:21,501 --> 00:06:22,334
assimilated to the pcaob next to it.
The Sanskrit in Persian examples are 

121
00:06:25,731 --> 00:06:26,900
sought them.
Examples,

122
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:30,140
since you can see that the k sound 
became shuck and suck,

123
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:34,850
it also seems that the w sound shifted 
to a v sounded Sanskrit and to uh,

124
00:06:34,851 --> 00:06:35,684
be sound in Persian and those are sound 
changes that take place frequently in 

125
00:06:38,691 --> 00:06:39,524
various different languages.
Other frequent cognates include the 

126
00:06:41,721 --> 00:06:44,690
numbers from one to 10 words referring 
to family members,

127
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:45,853
agricultural words and various natural 
phenomena like the words for tree and 

128
00:06:49,431 --> 00:06:54,431
wood in Prodo Indo European Dodo or Dre,
you in old English today,

129
00:06:54,941 --> 00:06:58,910
Ale in Gothic put a u in ancient Greek 
Dota,

130
00:06:59,330 --> 00:07:00,163
which actually meant spear in Sanskrit 
Daadab in old church slavonic don't 

131
00:07:04,461 --> 00:07:08,480
evolve in Armenian zod this shared 
vocabulary.

132
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:10,760
It might be hard to spot when you're not
looking for it,

133
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:11,863
but when you start to notice the sounds 
that commonly alternate in those 

134
00:07:14,301 --> 00:07:15,590
cognates,
for example,

135
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:19,880
the voiceless t and the voice deep,
then cognit start to be more obvious.

136
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,073
Indo European languages have developed 
so far from pro Indo European that 

137
00:07:24,291 --> 00:07:25,124
grammatically they are very diverse and 
they have many features that other Indo 

138
00:07:27,861 --> 00:07:28,694
European languages don't share.
But because Prodo Indo European was a 

139
00:07:32,001 --> 00:07:32,834
highly inflected language,
all of its descendants are inflected 

140
00:07:35,421 --> 00:07:37,670
language is to some extent by 
inflection,

141
00:07:37,671 --> 00:07:38,504
I mean that words change form to reflect
grammatical functions like number 

142
00:07:42,171 --> 00:07:44,660
person,
tense mood case.

143
00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:45,523
One example is the verb endings we find 
in various Indo European languages in 

144
00:07:49,221 --> 00:07:52,790
Prodo Indo European,
the reconstructed singular forms for the

145
00:07:52,791 --> 00:07:55,990
verb to bear our pedal or the head of 
me,

146
00:07:56,430 --> 00:07:57,263
the head of seat,
that a t and in Sanskrit the had Ami 

147
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:03,553
Darcy Bahati in Latin Fedele fetis fed 
it in old English better or Bentyl 

148
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:15,830
biddies biddies in many languages,
including English.

149
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:18,350
These inflections have been lost to a 
large extent.

150
00:08:18,530 --> 00:08:19,363
In modern English,
we only retained the third person 

151
00:08:21,111 --> 00:08:23,420
inflection.
He bears or she bears,

152
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:24,373
but English still had the second person 
inflection until the early modern 

153
00:08:26,991 --> 00:08:29,630
English period.
So if you read a King James Bible,

154
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:32,990
you'll see the sentence,
thou barest record of myself.

155
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:33,973
This is the second person form and val 
means you cases pro Indo European nouns 

156
00:08:39,021 --> 00:08:41,510
had inflections for eight grammatical 
cases.

157
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:42,433
Sanskrit maintained all eight cases and 
so did the ancient Iranian language of 

158
00:08:45,931 --> 00:08:50,780
Estin Latin retained six cases and old 
English had for modern English.

159
00:08:50,781 --> 00:08:51,614
Nounce do not have case endings and 
that's also true for many other Indo 

160
00:08:54,351 --> 00:08:57,270
European languages like most of the 
romance languages,

161
00:08:57,330 --> 00:08:59,820
when language is no longer have case 
inflections,

162
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:00,803
the function of nouns is indicated more 
by word order and by the use of 

163
00:09:03,631 --> 00:09:04,464
prepositions.
But many modern Indo European languages 

164
00:09:06,661 --> 00:09:10,080
do have numerous cases like most Balto,
Slavic languages,

165
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:13,110
which have six to eight cases,
German and Icelandic,

166
00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:16,530
which have four cases and modern Greek,
which also has four.

167
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:18,473
So the connection between the modern 
Indo European languages may not be 

168
00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:22,283
obvious,
but when we look back historically at 

169
00:09:23,791 --> 00:09:27,360
how those languages have developed and 
the different stages of those languages,

170
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:30,420
we can find more connections.
The question of the day,

171
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:31,283
if you speak in Indo European language,
did you discover any new connections 

172
00:09:34,381 --> 00:09:36,720
between your language and others during 
this video?

173
00:09:36,930 --> 00:09:39,900
