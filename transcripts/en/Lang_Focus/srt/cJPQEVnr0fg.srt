Hello everyone,
welcome to the Lange Focus Channel and 

2
00:00:03,091 --> 00:00:03,924
my name is Paul.
Today's topic is the Korean language or 

3
00:00:07,790 --> 00:00:11,940
hungle name as it's called in Korean and
actually in North Korea.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:12,833
It's called Tucson.
My Korean is one of the major languages 

5
00:00:16,351 --> 00:00:17,184
of Northeast Asia.
It's spoken as a first language by a 

6
00:00:19,621 --> 00:00:20,454
total of around 80 million people,
including around $50 million in South 

7
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:24,713
Korea,
$25 million in North Korea and around 

8
00:00:26,551 --> 00:00:27,384
two point 5 million in China,
including the Yom [inaudible] and Chung 

9
00:00:30,061 --> 00:00:30,894
back Korean autonomous areas,
which are both in Gelian province near 

10
00:00:34,141 --> 00:00:38,160
the border with North Korea.
It's also spoken by minorities in Japan,

11
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:39,023
Russia,
and numerous other countries throughout 

12
00:00:40,441 --> 00:00:41,274
the world.
The roots of the Korean language are 

13
00:00:42,871 --> 00:00:45,450
unclear and are the subject of much 
debate.

14
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:46,393
Some think it's a member of the 
altruistic language family alongside 

15
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:52,320
Turkic Mongolian and 10 gooseneck and 
Japonica languages,

16
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:53,243
but these days the alltech language 
family is no longer widely accepted or 

17
00:00:56,641 --> 00:00:58,290
shall we say it's unproven.

18
00:00:58,470 --> 00:00:59,303
Others think that Korean shares ancient 
roots with the dravidian languages of 

19
00:01:02,431 --> 00:01:03,264
southern India and Sri Lanka,
and there's another theory that Korean 

20
00:01:05,791 --> 00:01:08,040
derives from the Austronesian language 
family,

21
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:11,040
but there's no definitive proof for any 
of these theories,

22
00:01:11,041 --> 00:01:14,220
so Korean is often defined as a language
isolate.

23
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:16,980
The sole member of the chorionic 
language family.

24
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:18,053
The lack of evidence for any of these 
theories is largely because of the lack 

25
00:01:21,121 --> 00:01:21,954
of samples of older Korean writing.
The oldest samples that we are aware of 

26
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:29,370
are less than a thousand years old and 
the written in Chinese characters making

27
00:01:29,371 --> 00:01:34,371
them hard to decipher old Korean.
The first century ce marks the beginning

28
00:01:34,411 --> 00:01:35,244
of the three kingdoms period on the 
Korean Peninsula and Manchuria the 

29
00:01:38,371 --> 00:01:41,470
kingdoms were picked.
J and Sheila.

30
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:42,683
It's not known for sure just how closely
the languages of these kingdoms were 

31
00:01:45,631 --> 00:01:46,464
related.
They may have all been closely related 

32
00:01:48,571 --> 00:01:49,404
dialects of old Korean or they may have 
been distinct members of the chorionic 

33
00:01:53,011 --> 00:01:55,260
language family from limited 
information,

34
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:56,430
mainly place names.

35
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:59,850
It appears that the languages were 
similar but not exactly the same.

36
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:01,283
There may have been two groups have 
chorionic languages with a group 

37
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:05,093
including Pouliot,
Co gooyow and pull your Pec Jay and the 

38
00:02:08,521 --> 00:02:11,370
hunting group,
which included Shinola in South Korea.

39
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,233
It's widely believed that Shinola is the
direct ancestor of modern Korean in 

40
00:02:15,991 --> 00:02:16,824
North Korea.
It's widely believed that go google is 

41
00:02:18,901 --> 00:02:23,901
the direct ancestor of modern Korean.
During the Unified Sheila period,

42
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:24,773
beginning in the seventh century,
when Sheila conquered the other 

43
00:02:27,061 --> 00:02:27,894
kingdoms,
the Shilla variety became the dominant 

44
00:02:29,701 --> 00:02:30,534
language of the peninsula.
This is the form of old Korean that 

45
00:02:33,001 --> 00:02:33,834
became the ancestor of Middle Korean.
Korea has been tremendously influenced 

46
00:02:38,401 --> 00:02:41,610
by China throughout its history due to 
invasion attempts,

47
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:43,650
alliances,
and extensive trade.

48
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:45,623
The influence on Korean culture includes
stunning influence on the Korean 

49
00:02:48,541 --> 00:02:51,120
language.
Since Korean didn't have its own writing

50
00:02:51,121 --> 00:02:51,954
system,
it adopted the Chinese writing system 

51
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:54,533
and used it well into the era of Middle 
Korean and a huge amount of Chinese 

52
00:02:57,991 --> 00:03:00,970
vocabulary entered Korean through the 
literary language,

53
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:02,763
Middle Korean.

54
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:06,010
When the Korea Dynasty began in the 10th
century,

55
00:03:06,130 --> 00:03:06,963
the capital moved to case on,
so the case on dialect became the 

56
00:03:09,641 --> 00:03:12,970
prestige language.
It seems that by this time the peninsula

57
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,810
basically spoke the same language,
so this was simply a dialectal change.

58
00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:21,010
The first written record of Korean that 
we know of beyond place names comes from

59
00:03:21,011 --> 00:03:21,844
this time period,
the sources Chinese and gives a few 

60
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:28,450
hundred examples of Korean words written
phonetically using Chinese characters.

61
00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:29,403
One feature of Middle Korean is that it 
featured for tones and on top of that 

62
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,920
Chinese loan words still retained their 
tones as well.

63
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:39,520
These tone distinctions have disappeared
in modern standard Korean,

64
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:43,300
but there are a couple of dialects that 
do retain some of these distinctions.

65
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:44,343
We know that Middle Korean had tones 
because there were markings indicating 

66
00:03:47,291 --> 00:03:48,124
tone in the hungle writing system,
which was created in 1444 by king say 

67
00:03:52,421 --> 00:03:53,254
Joan,
the great of the Chosun Dynasty humble 

68
00:03:55,691 --> 00:03:56,524
was created to increase literacy among 
the poor and people without a formal 

69
00:03:59,621 --> 00:04:00,454
education.

70
00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:01,803
Prior to the creation of hungle Korean 
went through a number of different 

71
00:04:04,511 --> 00:04:05,344
writing systems that use Chinese 
characters in various ways to represent 

72
00:04:08,351 --> 00:04:09,184
Korean.
None of which were an ideal match for 

73
00:04:10,781 --> 00:04:13,540
Korean or very easy to learn in the 
beginning.

74
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:16,450
Elites and scholars opposed the 
introduction of hungle,

75
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,313
but over the following centuries it 
became widespread and humble is such an 

76
00:04:20,471 --> 00:04:21,304
ingenious writing system that it's 
really hard to imagine how it wouldn't 

77
00:04:23,831 --> 00:04:24,664
have become widespread for a long time.
Korean was often written and published 

78
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:32,140
in a mixed script using hunch on Chinese
characters for content,

79
00:04:32,141 --> 00:04:36,040
words and hungle for functional or 
grammatical words and inflections.

80
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:39,100
It was quite similar to how Japanese is 
still written today.

81
00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:40,203
Speaking of Japanese,
Korea was occupied by Japan from 1910 

82
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:46,660
until 1945.
During the occupation,

83
00:04:46,690 --> 00:04:47,523
Japanese was made.
The official language and policies were 

84
00:04:49,631 --> 00:04:50,464
implemented that would have replaced 
Korean with Japanese if the occupation 

85
00:04:54,101 --> 00:04:55,000
had not been ended.

86
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:55,953
Japanese was made the language of 
education except for Korean class and 

87
00:04:59,291 --> 00:05:00,124
speaking Korean at school was band.
Koreans were pressured to replace their 

88
00:05:03,431 --> 00:05:06,460
Korean names with Japanese names and 
Korean language.

89
00:05:06,461 --> 00:05:07,294
Newspapers were ordered to shut down.
These assimilationist policies were 

90
00:05:10,451 --> 00:05:14,290
gradually introduced and speed it up in 
the later years of the occupation.

91
00:05:15,010 --> 00:05:15,843
Thankfully,
the Korean language survived to the 

92
00:05:17,201 --> 00:05:18,034
occupation,
but a significant amount of Japanese 

93
00:05:19,871 --> 00:05:23,100
vocabulary.
It was absorbed into the language in the

94
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:23,933
decades since the occupation ended.
Hungyo have gradually become 

95
00:05:26,591 --> 00:05:29,410
deemphasized in favor of hungle.
Nowadays,

96
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:33,220
most texts are written entirely or 
mostly in hungle with hunch up,

97
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:34,083
mainly used to prevent possible 
ambiguity between homophones and in 

98
00:05:37,271 --> 00:05:38,104
North Korea.
Specifically hunch shot were eliminated 

99
00:05:40,091 --> 00:05:40,924
from all official publications in 1949.
I'm going to speculate that the growing 

100
00:05:44,771 --> 00:05:48,820
emphasis on hungle was partly a reaction
to the Japanese occupation,

101
00:05:48,910 --> 00:05:49,743
that a growing sense of Korean 
sovereignty made the Korean people want 

102
00:05:52,301 --> 00:05:54,700
to use more of their nations homegrown 
script.

103
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:59,000
The existence of the hungle script is 
now every year on hungle day,

104
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:02,540
October ninth in South Korea and on 
chosen Google Day,

105
00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:07,040
January 15th in North Korea.
Both Koreas have a literacy rate of over

106
00:06:07,041 --> 00:06:10,040
99 percent.
So I guess there is reason to celebrate.

107
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:12,350
So what's Korean like?
Well,

108
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:13,213
there's a lot to say about Korean and 
there's no way I can give a complete 

109
00:06:15,861 --> 00:06:19,250
comprehensive overview of the whole 
language in a single video,

110
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:21,500
but we'll look at some of it's important
features.

111
00:06:21,770 --> 00:06:22,603
Hungle hungle is a fantastic writing 
system that you can learn to read very 

112
00:06:26,331 --> 00:06:27,164
quickly.
There is a basic set of consonant and 

113
00:06:29,001 --> 00:06:32,900
vowel symbols that are arranged together
to form compact syllables.

114
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:35,810
This says hungle this symbolist,
Huh?

115
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:37,730
This is,
this is,

116
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,980
this is,
this is,

117
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,510
and this is,
oh,

118
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:42,883
this system is ingenious.
Because once you get used to the most 

119
00:06:45,411 --> 00:06:49,190
common combinations of symbols,
then you can instantly recognize them.

120
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:52,640
The consonant symbols fall into groups 
of different letters.

121
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:53,533
These continents are vilar,
and the basic shape shows the tongues 

122
00:06:56,271 --> 00:06:57,104
position in the mouth.
This point indicates the place of 

123
00:06:59,091 --> 00:06:59,924
articulation near the back of the mouth.
These consonants are alveolar and the 

124
00:07:03,471 --> 00:07:06,380
basic shape shows the tongue touching 
the roof of the mouth.

125
00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:11,240
These consonants are bilabial and the 
basic shape shows a mouth with two lips.

126
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:12,223
These consonants are dentals,
and the basic shape shows the place of 

127
00:07:14,991 --> 00:07:18,500
articulation at the upper teeth.
These consonants are glottal,

128
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:22,400
and the basic shape shows that the place
of articulation is in your throat.

129
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:24,133
Vocabulary.
In most current examples of written 

130
00:07:26,121 --> 00:07:26,954
Korean,
all or almost all of the words are 

131
00:07:28,371 --> 00:07:30,980
written in Hungle,
including native Korean words.

132
00:07:30,981 --> 00:07:31,711
And Sign,
oh,

133
00:07:31,711 --> 00:07:33,890
Korean words,
words of Chinese origin,

134
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:35,240
believe it or not,
sign.

135
00:07:35,241 --> 00:07:37,910
Oh,
Korean words account for over 60 percent

136
00:07:37,911 --> 00:07:39,290
of Korean vocabulary.

137
00:07:39,410 --> 00:07:42,500
There are most prevalent in formal and 
academic vocabulary,

138
00:07:42,530 --> 00:07:44,870
but they're very common in everyday 
speech as well.

139
00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:49,130
Let's look at the Chinese vocabulary 
that appears in the following sentences.

140
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:51,500
This sentence means,
do you like your teacher?

141
00:07:51,610 --> 00:07:55,050
Some of the same names were.
He'll notice the word sunsetting,

142
00:07:55,130 --> 00:07:57,920
which means teacher.
This word is of Chinese origin.

143
00:07:58,730 --> 00:08:00,830
This sentence means what's your phone 
number?

144
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:01,873
So novel and allowable.
All the words for telephone and number 

145
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:09,320
are of Chinese origin.
When Korean is written in a mixed hungle

146
00:08:09,321 --> 00:08:10,160
hunt,
just script.

147
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:13,100
You can more easily identify it,
the Sino Korean words,

148
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:13,993
and you can more easily distinguish 
between words that sound the same 

149
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:18,890
because they are written with different 
Chinese characters,

150
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:20,930
but these days they are mainly written 
in hungle.

151
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:24,440
Korean also contains more recent loan 
words from other languages,

152
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:28,070
mainly English words like choose soup,
meaning juice,

153
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:30,990
poor meaning fork,
send,

154
00:08:30,991 --> 00:08:31,370
do,
eat,

155
00:08:31,370 --> 00:08:32,990
see meaning,
sandwich.

156
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,033
Obviously the pronunciation of these 
words has naturally changed and become 

157
00:08:36,861 --> 00:08:37,694
suited to Korean phonology.
Some loan words are abbreviated or used 

158
00:08:41,331 --> 00:08:43,730
in ways that the original words were not
used.

159
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:47,150
For example,
the word said con means Selfie,

160
00:08:47,210 --> 00:08:49,520
which came from the words self and 
camera.

161
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:54,890
Another example I usually ping means 
window shopping and comes from the words

162
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:59,130
I and shopping sentence structure.
Korean is a verb,

163
00:08:59,131 --> 00:09:02,070
final language with the verb.
At the end of the sentence,

164
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:06,750
a typical sentence is Sov.
This sentence means I play baseball.

165
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:09,570
None in Yagoona Hale.
Here's the subject.

166
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,580
Now here's the object.
Yeah,

167
00:09:11,581 --> 00:09:13,260
Gu,
and here's the verb.

168
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,273
Hail.
It's also possible to say the sentence 

169
00:09:16,471 --> 00:09:19,080
with no subject if it's clear from the 
context,

170
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:21,450
but let's go back to the original 
sentence for a minute.

171
00:09:21,810 --> 00:09:24,150
In addition to the subject,
object and verb,

172
00:09:24,270 --> 00:09:25,920
there are two other words in the 
sentence.

173
00:09:26,010 --> 00:09:27,330
These words are particles.

174
00:09:27,450 --> 00:09:28,283
Words that are placed after nouns to 
indicate their function or relationship 

175
00:09:31,441 --> 00:09:35,700
to other words in the sentence.
Little is a direct object marker showing

176
00:09:35,701 --> 00:09:36,121
that,
yeah,

177
00:09:36,121 --> 00:09:40,770
Gu baseball is the object of the verb.
A little is the form that follows a word

178
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,330
ending in a vowel.
Oh,

179
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:45,060
is the form that follows words ending in
a consonant,

180
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:50,250
noon is a topic marker.
The form that comes afterwards ending in

181
00:09:50,251 --> 00:09:53,910
a consonant is earned,
not is the subject of the sentence,

182
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:54,773
but it's also the topic that means now 
is information that has previously been 

183
00:09:58,501 --> 00:10:03,030
mentioned or as clear from the context 
and that it's the topic being elaborated

184
00:10:03,031 --> 00:10:05,760
on.
There are also subject markers.

185
00:10:06,030 --> 00:10:10,140
He after a consonant and Qa after a 
vowel subject,

186
00:10:10,141 --> 00:10:10,974
markers are used to introduce new 
information or to introduce the 

187
00:10:13,681 --> 00:10:16,440
importance of existing information.
In other words,

188
00:10:16,441 --> 00:10:17,274
to emphasize it,
we could change the sentence above to 

189
00:10:19,711 --> 00:10:21,780
make not the subject.
Degas,

190
00:10:21,810 --> 00:10:22,830
yeah,
I alluded hail,

191
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:23,933
notice that not is pronounced as nay 
when followed by ca and the 

192
00:10:27,181 --> 00:10:30,690
pronunciation of changes to God.
In this sentence,

193
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:35,400
Degas shows that I is the new 
information or emphasized information.

194
00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:36,323
This might be said in response to a 
question asking who plays baseball in 

195
00:10:39,541 --> 00:10:42,430
English.
We might stress this subject like I play

196
00:10:42,431 --> 00:10:45,390
baseball.
Here's another example of when you might

197
00:10:45,391 --> 00:10:46,560
use the subject marker.

198
00:10:49,430 --> 00:10:51,720
This sentence means my mother entered 
the room.

199
00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:54,510
Actually,
this part literally means our mother,

200
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:57,900
but it's used to mean my when referring 
to your own ingroup.

201
00:10:58,170 --> 00:10:59,250
Anyway,
in this case,

202
00:10:59,310 --> 00:11:03,180
my mother is new information because 
before that she wasn't present,

203
00:11:03,210 --> 00:11:06,330
she wasn't in the room,
so the subject particle is suitable.

204
00:11:06,331 --> 00:11:07,164
Here,
this word here a is another particle 

205
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:13,050
showing direction,
like the English preposition to or into,

206
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:16,290
but technically speaking,
since the particle comes after the Noun,

207
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,750
it's a post position rather than a 
preposition.

208
00:11:19,530 --> 00:11:23,070
In Korean modifiers come before the 
things that they modify.

209
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:25,530
That means that adjectives come before 
nouns.

210
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:26,613
Dual pins on this means a tall mountain.
This is the word for tall and this is 

211
00:11:31,231 --> 00:11:32,064
the word for mountain.
This part connects the adjective to the 

212
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,073
gnome.
Longer modifiers also come before the 

213
00:11:38,761 --> 00:11:40,260
noun.
You want them to modify it.

214
00:11:40,650 --> 00:11:42,270
This phrase means the mountain.

215
00:11:42,270 --> 00:11:43,830
I want to climb.
Degas,

216
00:11:43,831 --> 00:11:44,990
older bullshit.
Pleasanton,

217
00:11:45,450 --> 00:11:48,420
word for word.
This phrase is I subject marker.

218
00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:50,850
Climb,
want connector mountain.

219
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:53,160
But if we take the whole modifying 
clause,

220
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:54,153
a single unit,
this modifier plus Noun pattern is like 

221
00:11:56,741 --> 00:11:59,080
saying the,
I want to climb the mountain.

222
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:02,620
So whereas in English,
the modifier would come after the nouns.

223
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,210
In Korean,
it comes before.

224
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,850
By the way,
this sentence could mean a mountain.

225
00:12:06,851 --> 00:12:07,684
I want to climb with indefinite meaning.
Korean doesn't have definite or 

226
00:12:11,111 --> 00:12:11,944
indefinite articles.
So definiteness can be understood from 

227
00:12:14,111 --> 00:12:14,944
context verbs and adjectives.
Every sentence in Korean must end in 

228
00:12:18,971 --> 00:12:19,804
either a verb or an adjective,
and verbs and adjectives act very 

229
00:12:22,451 --> 00:12:25,570
similar to each other in Korean,
with both being conjugated,

230
00:12:25,571 --> 00:12:26,404
for pastor,
non past and for different politeness 

231
00:12:28,091 --> 00:12:29,350
levels.
First,

232
00:12:29,351 --> 00:12:30,184
let's look at verbs.
The dictionary form of verbs all end in 

233
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:33,970
de,
for example,

234
00:12:33,971 --> 00:12:38,971
this verb meaning to stop and this verb 
meaning to sleep.

235
00:12:40,030 --> 00:12:40,863
In order to conjugate these verbs,
you remove and you are left with the 

236
00:12:44,111 --> 00:12:44,944
verb stem which you add affixes to.
So let's conjugate these verbs in the 

237
00:12:48,551 --> 00:12:51,370
present tense or non past tense.
To be precise.

238
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:56,050
This sentence means he stops eating 
coonamble d'amato.

239
00:12:56,330 --> 00:13:00,490
So look at how we conjugate the verb to 
stop the stem is model.

240
00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:03,250
The informal,
present tense ending is ah,

241
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:06,730
and the polite suffix is your.
So this is the informal,

242
00:13:06,731 --> 00:13:10,730
polite conjugation for verb stems,
whose final vowel sound is awful,

243
00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:13,150
or Oh,
this verb ends in a consonant,

244
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:17,110
but when the verb ends in a vowel,
then only you'll is added.

245
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:19,300
For example,
Coonan's Hale,

246
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:20,313
he sleeps notes that with either of 
these verbs you could remove your to 

247
00:13:25,241 --> 00:13:28,120
make an informal non polite sentence.
In other words,

248
00:13:28,121 --> 00:13:28,954
a more casual sentence.
If the stem ends in it's replaced with 

249
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:34,233
audio.
Here's an example with the verb meaning 

250
00:13:35,890 --> 00:13:37,510
to try and sit down.

251
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:41,260
Could do it.
In this sentence means they try.

252
00:13:42,430 --> 00:13:47,430
If the last vegetable of the stem is all
or eat or a combined vowel,

253
00:13:47,950 --> 00:13:50,620
then or are y'all,
is added to the stem.

254
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,770
Look down again,
we have the verb meaning to eat.

255
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:55,413
Non In this sentence means I eat pogie.
Let's take a look at how the past tense 

256
00:14:01,271 --> 00:14:04,270
is formed by changing some of those 
sentences into the past.

257
00:14:04,570 --> 00:14:07,650
Before we had this sentence,
Cunanan look on io,

258
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:10,570
meaning he stops eating.
Let's change this to.

259
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:13,930
He stopped eating in the past Coonan 
sale.

260
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:19,510
He Sleeps Coonan tail,
he slept coconut soil.

261
00:14:20,050 --> 00:14:22,780
Let's remove the polite suffix,
your for a moment.

262
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:23,853
Notice that the past tense form equals 
the present tense form with this affix 

263
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:32,520
saw attached then to make it polite,
we can add your future tense.

264
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:35,860
Korean technically doesn't have a future
tense,

265
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:36,753
only passed and non passed,
but there are ways to express the 

266
00:14:39,491 --> 00:14:41,380
future,
the most common being,

267
00:14:41,381 --> 00:14:42,850
the probable future for them.

268
00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:43,863
To use the probable future form,
you add a little cardio to the verb 

269
00:14:47,081 --> 00:14:52,081
stem.
None in this sentence means I'm going to

270
00:14:52,281 --> 00:14:53,114
eat Takagi.
When talking about things aside from 

271
00:14:55,191 --> 00:14:56,024
yourself,
the probable future refers to things 

272
00:14:57,801 --> 00:15:01,370
that you think are likely to happen,
but when referring to yourself,

273
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,920
it shows determination rather than 
speculation.

274
00:15:04,010 --> 00:15:08,720
So we can translate this as I'm going to
eat typography or I shall eat meat.

275
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:09,673
By the way,
I'm probably pronouncing this word to 

276
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:13,010
you,
the way it's pronounced in Japanese.

277
00:15:13,190 --> 00:15:14,023
I live in Japan,
so I've eaten a lot more top pogie here 

278
00:15:15,801 --> 00:15:16,634
than in Korea.
Adjectives when an adjective is in the 

279
00:15:18,951 --> 00:15:20,870
predicative position,
in other words,

280
00:15:20,930 --> 00:15:21,763
after the subject,
then it functions similarly to a verb 

281
00:15:24,350 --> 00:15:26,920
and is conjugated.
Honeydew Pio,

282
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:30,260
the sentence means the mountain is tall,
the present tense,

283
00:15:30,290 --> 00:15:33,470
affix and polite affix are added to the 
adjective stem,

284
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:34,573
just like a verb,
and we can make this past tense to 

285
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:37,930
honeymoon.

286
00:15:37,930 --> 00:15:40,340
Paso,
the mountain was tall.

287
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:41,413
This is conjugated,
just like the past tense verb speech 

288
00:15:44,331 --> 00:15:45,164
levels.
When looking at verbs in the previous 

289
00:15:46,671 --> 00:15:47,504
section,
we looked mainly at the informal polite 

290
00:15:49,401 --> 00:15:50,234
forms of verbs like Mateo from my Ada 
and I briefly mentioned that we could 

291
00:15:55,401 --> 00:15:59,810
make the informal non polite form by 
removing your like Mata.

292
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:03,050
These are two of seven politeness levels
and Korean.

293
00:16:03,410 --> 00:16:04,850
Luckily for learners,
not all,

294
00:16:04,851 --> 00:16:09,080
seven of them are commonly used,
three or maybe four are commonly used.

295
00:16:09,290 --> 00:16:11,180
The other two are formal,
polite,

296
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,100
Manzanita,
and formal,

297
00:16:13,101 --> 00:16:13,934
non polite Munda.
The informal polite form is used when 

298
00:16:17,931 --> 00:16:22,040
speaking to friends and acquaintances.
Colleagues have a similar status to you,

299
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:23,420
shop staff,
et Cetera.

300
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:28,010
The informal non polite form is used 
when speaking to very close friends,

301
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:28,873
a brother or sister,
someone a few years younger than you or 

302
00:16:31,161 --> 00:16:31,994
someone you want to be rude to.
The formal polite form is used when 

303
00:16:35,241 --> 00:16:36,074
speaking to someone of higher status 
than you and people you are meeting for 

304
00:16:38,751 --> 00:16:39,584
the first time.

305
00:16:40,370 --> 00:16:41,203
The formal non polite form is basically 
a neutral forum that you can use when 

306
00:16:44,421 --> 00:16:46,580
you don't know who the reader or 
listener is.

307
00:16:46,850 --> 00:16:47,683
In other words,
when you're speaking to many types of 

308
00:16:48,891 --> 00:16:49,724
people,
it can also be used in speaking to 

309
00:16:51,171 --> 00:16:55,340
friends of the same age range.
Let's look at a couple more sentences in

310
00:16:55,341 --> 00:16:59,390
Korean and see what we find.
This sentence means I have a bicycle but

311
00:16:59,391 --> 00:17:00,224
I don't have a car.
None in has he been tackled so word for 

312
00:17:04,941 --> 00:17:08,630
word it's I topic marker,
Bicycle Subject Marker.

313
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:11,300
There is,
but car subject marker.

314
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:12,193
There isn't.
This sentence shows us how to express 

315
00:17:14,121 --> 00:17:14,954
possession or have in Korean.
The topic of the sentence is the 

316
00:17:17,991 --> 00:17:18,824
possessor.
Then the thing that is possessed is the 

317
00:17:20,721 --> 00:17:21,554
subject of the sentence with a subject 
marker followed by the existence verb 

318
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:25,753
meaning there is or there are.
Then we start a new sentence with but 

319
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:29,923
and there is a subject car with a 
subject marker followed by the negative 

320
00:17:33,321 --> 00:17:34,370
verb of existence.

321
00:17:34,430 --> 00:17:35,263
Meaning there isn't or there aren't.
Notice that there's no topic in the 

322
00:17:38,091 --> 00:17:41,150
second sentence.
The topic can be skipped if it's already

323
00:17:41,151 --> 00:17:43,100
clear.
Another sentence.

324
00:17:43,370 --> 00:17:46,070
This means this food is delicious.
Did you cook it?

325
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:49,980
You Michigan?
Less so the word for word,

326
00:17:49,981 --> 00:17:53,310
it's this food topic marker,
delicious,

327
00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:54,360
informal,
polite,

328
00:17:54,430 --> 00:17:56,220
conjugation.
You subject,

329
00:17:56,221 --> 00:17:58,650
marker.
Cooking did informal,

330
00:17:58,680 --> 00:17:59,513
non polite conjugation.
This first sentence follows a very 

331
00:18:01,891 --> 00:18:02,724
common pattern.
Here's the subject which is also the 

332
00:18:04,621 --> 00:18:05,454
topic of the sentence with a topic 
marker and before the known we can see 

333
00:18:08,491 --> 00:18:09,324
the demonstrative.
He meaning this and here we have the 

334
00:18:11,701 --> 00:18:14,010
adjective which is conjugated like a 
verb.

335
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:17,220
In the second sentence,
the subject is the word for you,

336
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:18,083
followed by the subject marker.
Ca Yodlee is the word for cooking or 

337
00:18:21,661 --> 00:18:23,820
cuisine,
and [inaudible] is the verb.

338
00:18:23,821 --> 00:18:26,970
Meaning do conjugated in the past tense,
informal,

339
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:27,833
non polite form.
This is the same as the informal polite 

340
00:18:30,121 --> 00:18:30,954
form with the syllable you'll removed 
from the end of both sentences when 

341
00:18:35,191 --> 00:18:36,570
talking directly to someone.

342
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:39,030
It's very common to drop the subject.
Pronouns,

343
00:18:39,090 --> 00:18:41,100
for example,
God is so,

344
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:42,413
but in this case,
the subject and subject marker ca are 

345
00:18:44,701 --> 00:18:49,170
included to emphasize you like did you 
cook it as opposed to someone else?

346
00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:50,183
Next,
we see something very common and 

347
00:18:51,331 --> 00:18:52,410
important.
In Korean,

348
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:55,050
we have a verb that consists of two 
parts,

349
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,750
unknown of Chinese origin,
followed by the verb,

350
00:18:58,530 --> 00:19:00,900
which means to do or to make.
Many,

351
00:19:00,901 --> 00:19:03,090
many Korean verbs are constructed this 
way.

352
00:19:03,390 --> 00:19:06,060
For example,
Eda meaning to work,

353
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:08,213
meaning to study.
There are also some words of English 

354
00:19:10,081 --> 00:19:11,880
origin that form verbs.
This way,

355
00:19:12,030 --> 00:19:15,090
for example,
how will have meaning to shower.

356
00:19:16,470 --> 00:19:17,303
Let's look at one last sentence.
Can you tune this sentence means she is 

357
00:19:22,171 --> 00:19:25,770
a good student word for word,
it's she topic marker.

358
00:19:25,950 --> 00:19:29,490
Good connector student.
Be Informal,

359
00:19:29,491 --> 00:19:30,324
polite.
So here we have the subject which is 

360
00:19:31,921 --> 00:19:33,990
also the topic with a topic marker.

361
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:37,950
Then we have the adjective meaning good,
and since it comes before the gnome,

362
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:38,813
there's a connector.
Huck saying means student and the verb 

363
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:44,580
is at the end.
This verb is the informal polite form of

364
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:45,473
EDA,
which basically means to be and usually 

365
00:19:47,731 --> 00:19:48,564
comes after nouns.
There's also a negative form of this 

366
00:19:51,271 --> 00:19:52,440
verb,
Anita,

367
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:56,430
so we could make this sentence negative 
like this Cunanan swoon.

368
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:00,810
Now the sentence means she is not a good
student.

369
00:20:01,430 --> 00:20:03,840
Noticed that in the negative form of 
this sentence,

370
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:06,660
the subject marker,
he comes after us saying,

371
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:07,613
so with this particular verb,
you have the topic and then the 

372
00:20:10,231 --> 00:20:13,170
compliment actually becomes the subject 
of the sentence.

373
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:14,873
There's really so much more I could say 
about Korean and there's no way I can 

374
00:20:17,251 --> 00:20:18,084
cover everything in a single video,
but hopefully that gave you a taste of 

375
00:20:20,791 --> 00:20:23,550
the language and sparked your interest.
In some ways,

376
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:25,980
Korean is strikingly similar to 
Japanese,

377
00:20:26,010 --> 00:20:26,843
but in some ways it's quite different.
You might want to check out my video 

378
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:30,144
from a couple of years ago on the 
differences and similarities between 

379
00:20:32,791 --> 00:20:35,340
Korean and Japanese.
Be sure to follow Lang,

380
00:20:35,341 --> 00:20:37,050
focus on facebook,
twitter,

381
00:20:37,051 --> 00:20:38,910
and Instagram,
and once again,

382
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:41,760
thank you to all of my wonderful patrion
supporters,

383
00:20:41,790 --> 00:20:45,660
especially my top tier patrion 
supporters right here on the screen.

384
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:46,703
Many thanks to them and to everyone.

385
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:51,573
