00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:03,020
Hi Guys.
Today I'm going to talk about this book,

2
00:00:03,410 --> 00:00:04,243
teach yourself Arabic and I'm going to 
tell you whether it is a genius work of 

3
00:00:07,521 --> 00:00:10,250
art or a piece of crap from hell.

4
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:17,513
Okay,

5
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:21,020
good afternoon guys.
I'm going to talk today about a book and

6
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:24,050
CD program that I used in the past to 
study Arabic.

7
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:25,093
Uh,
it's called teach yourself Arabic from 

8
00:00:26,871 --> 00:00:31,730
the infamous teach yourself series a in 
it's this book right here by Jack smarts

9
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:35,720
and Francis El Toro for or something 
like that.

10
00:00:35,721 --> 00:00:37,730
I don't know how to say his last name,
first of all.

11
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:39,650
That's a,
I should say upfront.

12
00:00:39,830 --> 00:00:42,500
I want to be careful that we're talking 
about the same book.

13
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:45,470
There are actually two books called 
teach yourself Arabic.

14
00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:49,220
This one right here is the old one from 
1991.

15
00:00:49,221 --> 00:00:52,640
This one is basically focused on,
uh,

16
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:57,440
on receptive skills on reading and 
listening to Arabic.

17
00:00:57,441 --> 00:01:01,130
It's not really focused on 
conversational or communicative Arabic.

18
00:01:01,490 --> 00:01:02,323
That one is kind of universally 
lambasted by people who buy it because 

19
00:01:07,370 --> 00:01:10,610
when they buy a teacher yourself booked,
they're hoping to learn to communicate.

20
00:01:10,730 --> 00:01:11,630
Most people,
I think.

21
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:12,793
And that book is basically based on um,
reading and listening to the news in 

22
00:01:17,991 --> 00:01:20,300
Arabic.
That's really the purpose of that book.

23
00:01:20,301 --> 00:01:21,134
So we're gonna focus on this one,
which is the new one published in 2001 

24
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:27,380
and it has a much more community 
communicative,

25
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:28,333
conversational focus and it's much more 
suitable for the average learner who 

26
00:01:32,961 --> 00:01:35,840
buys teach yourself.
So we'll talk about this.

27
00:01:35,841 --> 00:01:39,950
It's a pretty good book but it has some 
weaknesses.

28
00:01:39,951 --> 00:01:40,784
So I want to talk about those just to 
give you an idea and that will help you 

29
00:01:43,701 --> 00:01:47,120
maybe use the book better.
So first of all,

30
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:48,133
the book is based on,
well it's teaching you modern standard 

31
00:01:51,591 --> 00:01:54,440
Arabic.
That is the formal kind of Arabic,

32
00:01:54,441 --> 00:01:57,470
the standard Arabic that is used in 
newspapers.

33
00:01:57,471 --> 00:01:58,304
It's used in the media and it's used 
kind of as a tool to to communicate 

34
00:02:02,841 --> 00:02:06,110
across dialects because Arabic has a lot
of different dialects.

35
00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:10,370
So when people want to communicate with 
a speaker of another dialect,

36
00:02:10,371 --> 00:02:11,204
they kind of,
they incorporate some of the standard 

37
00:02:13,701 --> 00:02:17,480
language into their speech to make it 
understandable for the other person.

38
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:19,003
So this is,
this is all about modern standard 

39
00:02:20,991 --> 00:02:21,824
Arabic,
but it teaches it in a way that is 

40
00:02:22,851 --> 00:02:26,990
communicative,
conversational and helps you to interact

41
00:02:26,991 --> 00:02:29,570
in daily situations.
So that's kind of rare.

42
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:32,420
There are some other books now that,
that do the same thing,

43
00:02:32,421 --> 00:02:34,850
but a few years ago this was kind of the
only,

44
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:38,630
the only popular book like that,
the only common book like that.

45
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:39,493
And it was kind of rare to find in 
modern standard Arabic book that did 

46
00:02:43,071 --> 00:02:43,904
that.
Um,

47
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,530
so it's good for that and it's good in 
the language that it teaches.

48
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:50,420
Like if you look at unit one,
two,

49
00:02:50,421 --> 00:02:50,871
three,
four,

50
00:02:50,871 --> 00:02:51,291
five,
six,

51
00:02:51,291 --> 00:02:52,124
seven,
those they teach good language that's 

52
00:02:54,111 --> 00:02:54,944
useful in daily situations in the 
vocabulary of presents I think is 

53
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,790
useful,
presented in a logical order.

54
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:01,953
Um,
it gives you a lot of experience with 

55
00:03:04,481 --> 00:03:05,314
different language skills.
So it's not only just the reading and 

56
00:03:07,811 --> 00:03:08,644
the listening,
but it gives you a chance to do some 

57
00:03:11,711 --> 00:03:15,640
writing exercises and that gives you a 
chance to do some grammar exercises.

58
00:03:15,641 --> 00:03:17,830
It's got a good balance of skills,
I find.

59
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:20,320
Of course you're not speaking with 
someone,

60
00:03:20,321 --> 00:03:22,120
you're not.
No one's listening to you and giving you

61
00:03:22,121 --> 00:03:24,310
feedback unless you have a private 
teacher.

62
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:29,680
But it covers all of the bases to 
whatever extent a book like this can.

63
00:03:29,681 --> 00:03:30,514
So it is a regular teacher self book 
even though it's based on a modern 

64
00:03:34,541 --> 00:03:36,390
standard Arabic.
So it's good,

65
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,630
uh,
good in that sense.

66
00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:41,620
The strange thing about this book is 
that it switches gears suddenly,

67
00:03:41,621 --> 00:03:46,600
like the first seven units are based on 
good conversational situations,

68
00:03:46,601 --> 00:03:50,440
daily life situations.
Then in unit eight it switches gears and

69
00:03:50,441 --> 00:03:54,730
throws you in head first into this 
traditional story about Sinbad,

70
00:03:54,731 --> 00:03:55,564
the sailor,
and I think it's actually an authentic 

71
00:03:57,071 --> 00:03:57,904
text from a book,
from some old book and it's written in 

72
00:04:00,521 --> 00:04:01,354
very kind of archaic Arabic and they 
throw you in head first and you're 

73
00:04:04,331 --> 00:04:05,230
reading this going,
wait,

74
00:04:05,231 --> 00:04:06,400
I haven't learned this stuff yet.

75
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,233
Why am I reading about Sinbad,
the sailor using these archaic sentence 

76
00:04:10,271 --> 00:04:11,104
structures?
So I found that unit quite frustrating 

77
00:04:13,841 --> 00:04:16,300
and it made me want to stop using the 
book to be honest,

78
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:20,770
because there were things in that story 
that I couldn't find in this book that I

79
00:04:20,771 --> 00:04:22,530
couldn't find them in,
uh,

80
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:23,793
on the internet and Google as trying to 
s to search and find what these 

81
00:04:26,171 --> 00:04:28,120
grammatical structures mean,
but it couldn't.

82
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,050
Um,
so I think the idea that they had was to

83
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:33,423
force you to,
to understand the main meaning without 

84
00:04:36,341 --> 00:04:37,174
understanding everything.
But if they do that without explaining 

85
00:04:40,901 --> 00:04:43,060
that,
and they do that suddenly,

86
00:04:43,061 --> 00:04:43,894
even though the first seven units were 
kind of different than it's a shock to 

87
00:04:46,601 --> 00:04:48,640
your system and you're going to get 
frustrated.

88
00:04:48,641 --> 00:04:53,290
So I found unit eight was annoying.
Unit nine was similar because they threw

89
00:04:53,291 --> 00:04:58,291
you in to a bunch of advertisements,
like the advertisements from a newspaper

90
00:04:59,471 --> 00:05:00,304
or a magazine.

91
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:02,530
Uh,
and there were some apartment ads,

92
00:05:02,531 --> 00:05:06,940
like looking for an apartment and the 
exercises ask you questions and you have

93
00:05:06,941 --> 00:05:09,940
to answer it based on these 
advertisements.

94
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:11,043
But the advertisements are full of words
that you haven't seen before and it's 

95
00:05:14,411 --> 00:05:16,730
just really hard to decipher them.
Uh,

96
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,113
and there's not a lot of guidance or 
explanation about the goal of that 

97
00:05:20,801 --> 00:05:23,360
exercise.
So if they had said like,

98
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:26,410
do the goal here is just a scan for 
important information,

99
00:05:26,411 --> 00:05:27,244
don't worry about everything,
then maybe it would be easier for 

100
00:05:30,491 --> 00:05:33,820
learners to get through and not worry 
about the stuff they're missing.

101
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:36,010
But it doesn't really do that.
It just throws you in,

102
00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:37,023
you confused because you're expected to 
deal with all this language you haven't 

103
00:05:40,001 --> 00:05:40,834
learned yet.
So that's a weakness of this book cause 

104
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,033
that that element,
it's written by two people and I have 

105
00:05:46,811 --> 00:05:47,644
the feeling that uh,
units one to seven were written by one 

106
00:05:50,261 --> 00:05:51,910
person,
unit eight and nine,

107
00:05:51,911 --> 00:05:54,940
and some of the others were written by 
someone else.

108
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:56,380
That could be true.
I'm not sure.

109
00:05:57,020 --> 00:05:58,220
Um,
later on in the book,

110
00:05:58,221 --> 00:06:02,660
some of the chapters get back to that 
communicative focus and that's good.

111
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:05,390
But some of them are still unclear.
And there were,

112
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:06,253
there are some sections where you're 
thrown in head first without adequate 

113
00:06:09,351 --> 00:06:10,400
guidance.
I feel.

114
00:06:11,090 --> 00:06:11,923
Um,
another weakness of the book is that at 

115
00:06:15,771 --> 00:06:20,570
some vocabulary appears in the exercises
or in the texts that is not taught.

116
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:21,643
It's not given to you in the book and 
it's not in the glossary at the back of 

117
00:06:25,101 --> 00:06:26,840
the book.
So for,

118
00:06:26,841 --> 00:06:27,890
uh,
for,

119
00:06:27,891 --> 00:06:30,140
um,
a new learner who has just bought one of

120
00:06:30,141 --> 00:06:30,974
these books and doesn't have an arsenal 
of dictionaries and grammar reference 

121
00:06:34,671 --> 00:06:37,430
books and stuff yet that's really 
frustrating.

122
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:38,663
Uh,
it's one of the most frustrating things 

123
00:06:39,801 --> 00:06:43,070
to look in the glossary and not find the
word you're looking for,

124
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:45,440
especially when it appears in this book.

125
00:06:46,130 --> 00:06:49,670
Um,
they're also very simple words.

126
00:06:49,671 --> 00:06:50,504
I tried to look up,
like I remember when I was using this 

127
00:06:52,341 --> 00:06:53,174
book,
I remember thinking to myself like 

128
00:06:54,650 --> 00:06:57,620
almost every time I went to look up a 
word in the glossary,

129
00:06:57,650 --> 00:07:00,080
it wasn't there.
Even when it was a really simple English

130
00:07:00,081 --> 00:07:00,914
word,
I would look it up and it wouldn't be 

131
00:07:01,821 --> 00:07:03,170
there.
And I would always be thinking,

132
00:07:03,171 --> 00:07:06,080
why isn't that word in this book?
Why isn't it in the glossary?

133
00:07:06,081 --> 00:07:07,580
That's such a simple,
basic word.

134
00:07:07,581 --> 00:07:09,340
It should be in here.
Um,

135
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:11,840
so the glossary is not up to snuff,
I think.

136
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:13,493
Um,
and they should really make sure that 

137
00:07:15,291 --> 00:07:17,790
everything we're expected to,
uh,

138
00:07:18,010 --> 00:07:18,843
expected to deal with.
All the words were expected to 

139
00:07:20,391 --> 00:07:22,340
understand it should be taught in this 
book.

140
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:25,340
So they don't do that.
To get around that,

141
00:07:25,341 --> 00:07:26,174
you need to have a good dictionary and 
to know how to look up words in that 

142
00:07:28,881 --> 00:07:31,760
dictionary using the root or whatever 
the system is.

143
00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:35,720
So get a dictionary and that will help 
you out a lot with this.

144
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:37,550
So with that said,
it's good.

145
00:07:37,551 --> 00:07:38,384
It's,
it does teach good language and it 

146
00:07:39,741 --> 00:07:42,850
teaches good situations and I think,
um,

147
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:44,220
uh,
it,

148
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:45,053
it teaches modern standard Arabic in a 
way that is useful for you to use as a 

149
00:07:48,891 --> 00:07:52,520
communication tool.
So just be prepared for those weaknesses

150
00:07:52,521 --> 00:07:54,250
if you get this book.
Uh,

151
00:07:54,290 --> 00:07:57,830
just that there are some parts that 
throw you in head first without a lot of

152
00:07:57,831 --> 00:08:00,140
support.
If you're an inductive learner,

153
00:08:00,141 --> 00:08:03,470
if you're someone who likes to figure 
things out without a lot of help,

154
00:08:03,471 --> 00:08:07,400
then you might enjoy that and just 
slugged through it and find that fun.

155
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:08,713
Um,
but if you're a more traditional 

156
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:10,933
deductive learner,
and you like to get the instruction up 

157
00:08:12,801 --> 00:08:14,180
front,
and then,

158
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:15,111
uh,
no,

159
00:08:15,111 --> 00:08:15,944
everything that comes after that,
then this book might frustrate you a 

160
00:08:18,621 --> 00:08:20,450
bit,
but it's good.

161
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:23,120
I'll give it 3.5
stars out of five.

162
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:25,490
Not the best,
but not the worst.

163
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:29,760
All right.
Thank you for listening and have a nice,

164
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:35,653
yeah.
