Speaker 1:          00:00          Hey, guess what, a few weeks ago I finished the Esperanto skill tree on Duolingo, as you can see right here from the golden calf. Uh, I mean owl. Sorry. Hello everyone. Welcome to the Lange Focus Channel and my name is Paul. Today I want to talk about duo lingo. It's an application for learning languages that now has over $100 million users. I've been using it for a few months and it's really an effective way to learn a language for free or so they say nothing.
