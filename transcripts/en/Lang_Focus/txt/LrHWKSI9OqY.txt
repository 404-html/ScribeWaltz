Speaker 1:          00:00          Hello everyone, this is the lane focus channel. My name is Paul. Thank you for tuning in. Okay. When refining and improving your own approach to learning languages, it's always great to look at people who have done it before. People have already done it very successfully and model what they're doing, copy what they're doing, copied their strategies for learning and their approach to learning, their attitudes, to learning all of those things. I've met a lot of people who are great with languages while traveling and also in my regular life and I'd like to talk about a couple of particularly impressive people that we can learn something from now. This goes back to my first time visiting Egypt in 1997. I was in a backpack of resort called the hub and I met a number of Bedouin girls who were there just selling bracelets that were selling little trinkets, souvenirs to tourists like me.

Speaker 1:          00:49          We would go and sit on the beach and these little beach side restaurant, a cushions laid out on the beach. People would serve you food and these better when girls would just wander in off the street and try to sell us bracelets. Now what was interesting was I sat there and I watched these girls switch between multiple different languages in the space of like five minutes. I would give them, speak English with lots of people. Then they would switch to French without skipping a beat and then they would switch to Spanish. They would switch to Italian, they would switch to Hebrew, they would switch to numerous different languages. German, uh, I think I even heard them speak Korean and Japanese now. I was wondering how would these young girls, like eight year old bedouin girls who probably don't have much education, how would they be able to speak eight different languages or 10 different languages or whatever it was.

Speaker 1:          01:33          So that got me thinking about what makes them successful and great with languages. So how do they do it? How do these eight year old Bedouin girls learn languages way better than your average college student in the Western World? Well, I think there were three main areas that I identified that we can learn from when we look at these girls. The first one is obviously their motivation, right? They have a strong economic incentive to learn that language. They come from a poor background. They live in a poor area or your only source of income. Their source of their livelihood is tourism. They have to speak foreign languages in order to get by and the more languages they can speak, the more potential customers they can communicate with, the more money they bring up, so they have that economic incentive. Most of us living in the west, we already have quite a cushy existence.

Speaker 1:          02:21          We can't quite imagine what it's like to have that economic motivation to learn. One of the interesting things I've heard about these young kids who are selling souvenirs is that they're not allowed to go home to their house until they sell a certain amount of souvenirs. They can't go home and have dinner until they sell 20 bracelets or something like that. So imagine that they have that positive incentive of making money, but they also have that negative incentive of being punished basically for not selling enough. So that really motivates them to just do whatever it takes. Right. So they have no excuses, they make no excuses for themselves, they just go out and do it because they have to. They really have choice. So they find whatever it takes, whatever resources they have inside themselves to learn. Now that's quite different from your average western person who whines and cries and says, I can't learn languages.

Speaker 1:          03:10          It's too hard. It takes too much time. I have to study. I want to watch TV instead of these kids actually go out and just do it because they have no choice. And if you decide to do that, you can do that too. So that's one thing we can learn from them. It's not only these better when kids either. I mean in other developing countries I've been to. I've noticed the same thing when I was in Cambodia, when I was in Indonesia when I was in Thailand. People who just have that economic incentive, they don't have the same mental blocks toward learning languages that people enrich countries do. They just do whatever it takes. They have that survival mentality and they just go for it. The second thing is that they're skilled are based in practical experience right from the start. They're not sitting at home or sitting in a classroom getting kind of theoretical experience or simulated experience.

Speaker 1:          03:55          They're out there getting real experience face to face with people using the language right from the start. Now that's different from the way most of us learn. We might learn from textbooks or in a classroom. We're learning theoretically in a simulated sort of context and then later when we have a certain level of the language, we go out and try to apply it with real people. That's kind of how most of us tend to learn languages or typical people in the western languages, but these kids, they go out right from the start and they're getting that experience now. Why is that good? If you're at home studying with a book or you're in a classroom listening to your teacher and looking at the Whiteboard, you're getting some sort of visual input. You're getting some auditory input to some extent. You're using those learning modalities, but you're not really getting as much hands on kinesthetic experience of actually using the language and feeling what it's like to use the language and when you get out there in the real world, in a real situation, it's very visually stimulating because you're looking at an entire scene surrounding you.

Speaker 1:          04:52          You're seeing different things. You're seeing, you're hearing the real sounds of an interaction that you have the real world around you. It's not a simulated experience like you get with your textbook at home or in a classroom. You're out there in the real world and also you are getting the kinesthetic experience so you know what it feels like to use the language and you get a certain emotional feeling when you interact with that person and you also, you can feel physically what it's like to use your body language and to actually physically interact with that person you're communicating with. Now all of that creates a kind of a kind of memory and experience that includes all of those different learning modalities and it's much easier to remember than when you're learning just from a book or from the classroom. I can remember experiences that I had using languages years and years ago.

Speaker 1:          05:40          I remember I have a memory of a situation 15 years ago in Jerusalem when I was there studying Hebrew and Hebrew course. An acquaintance of mine came into the room and he said, what most of the MTA when I was studying and and that means you're not finished yet. And I said, Lord, mostly empty. And they buy. That means, no, I'm not finished yet. I'm in the middle of studying. I remember that interaction and I remember the whole scene. I can see that room and I can see him come into the room and I can hear the intonation in his voice and I remember kind of feeling taken aback by it. The way he said it. It sounded like, what? You're an idiot. You're not finished yet. It was that kind of intonation. So I remember that whole feeling of the experience. Now that's the benefit of going out into the real world and really using the language.

Speaker 1:          06:23          You're encoding it into your physiology, right? It's a kinesthetic experience that you can recall as a memory. The memories are more powerful than memorization. That's how I like to think of it. Now, the third thing that these girls do well is that their use of the language is very functional and it's goal oriented. They're not just learning the language for the sake of learning it. They're not just learning it so they can say, Hey, I'm fluent in 10 languages. It's not an ego based approach to learning. They don't feel like they have to learn absolutely everything about the language. What is their goal? Their goal is to sell. That's their main function or main point for using that language and that's what they focus on when they're learning. So basically they want to sell to you and they're following a straight line from meeting you to selling to you.

Speaker 1:          07:08          The line ends when you buy something, all of the language they learn is basically just language. They need to follow that straight line and they can veer off the line a little bit and have a little bit of chatting time with you and they can ask some questions about where you're from and they can talk to you about some casual topics, but when they get too far off of that line too far away from their focused goal of selling to you, then they probably aren't that good at communicating because that's not the. That's not where they focus their studying and focus their attention. So they'll always bring their attention back to that straight line of trying to sell to you. Right. And all of their language is focused around that. So that's basically why they can speak 10 different languages at such a young age because they're not learning absolutely everything about the language.

Speaker 1:          07:52          They're learning the grammar and the structure of the language basically. And they're learning the basic vocabulary of language. Everything they need to sell to you and to communicate with you and chat with you and build rapport with you. And that kind of thing, but if you start talking about widely divergent subjects that have nothing to do with the sale and nothing to do with getting to know you well enough to make the sale happen, then they're not going to be that good with the language. So basically they're very focused on what they're using the language for and they have the basic structures of the language in place. So if in the future if they needed to learn it for a different function, they can always add that extra vocabulary, add those extra structures that they need on top of what they already know. But they don't try to learn everything at once.

Speaker 1:          08:32          They just learn what they need. Right. So in terms of your study, think about what you need to use the language for. You really need to learn absolutely everything about the language or do you just want to use it for a specific purpose? Like getting to know friends, like making some friends, being social in that language. Do you need to use it for a specific business purpose? Do you need to write emails in that language? Whatever your purpose is, maybe you should focus on that rather than trying to tackle the entire language in one big goal. Now it's also worth pointing out that these kids don't really worry about perfection at all. A lot of them speak with kind of funny grammar. They don't speak accurately, but they communicate. They understand you, you understand them, so it's all good. They can achieve that goal that they have for the language.

Speaker 1:          09:17          Now, the benefit that has for learning is that you don't slow yourself down. You don't put yourself into a bit of a panic worrying about all the details and worrying about perfection. Being a perfectionist can puts you in into a non ideal learning state. It can make you stressed, right? Anxiety and stresses the antithesis of learning. You want to avoid it like the plague, always relaxed. You can continue improving your accuracy and continue to self monitor and fix your your mistakes and all that, but don't worry about it. Just keep on learning and keep your goal in your functions for the language in mind, just like these girls do and you'll learn a lot better. So what can we learn from the eight year old Bedouin kid? Well, number one is no whining, no excuses, just go for it. Find what motivates you and do it.

Speaker 1:          10:03          Number two is get real experience from as early on as possible. Don't do all your studying and simulated experiences, simulated situations. Don't do all your studying with books. Get real experience with real people as early as you can. And the third thing is, know your main purpose for learning the language. Do you really need to know absolutely everything about the language? Do you just want to make friends in the language? Do you want to use it for a specific purpose? Focus on your purpose for that language and put your attention there. Then later in the future, if you need to add extra functions and extra purposes for the language you can, but focus on what you need it for and that will really accelerate your learning because you're not paying attention to things you don't really need to do. So if you ever think that you can't do it, that you can't learn a language that you're not good with languages or whatever. Just remember all those kids in developing countries who learn languages quite well because they, they just go for it and they have no mental block to learning it, so if they can do it, you can do it. Don't even stress just to go for it. Alright, this is Paul. Thank you for watching. Have a good night and see ya.

Speaker 1:          11:07          Hello everyone. Thank you for tuning into laying focused TV. I am your host Paul, and tonight we're going to talk about the difference between informal and formal language and which one you should focus on learning when you're learning a new language. Another awesome benefit of meditation for language learning is that it helps you with your listening comprehension. So when you're listening, often there's something that's blocking you are getting in your way. Now what I mean is this.
