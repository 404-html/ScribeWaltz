Speaker 2:          00:09          Hello everyone. Welcome to the Lange Focus Channel and my name is Paul. A couple of months back I made a video about whether English is really a dramatic language or not and I made the rather controversial statement that in a sense English is a hybrid language because so much of its vocabulary comes from the romance languages and from other languages. That statement was controversial because of the core of English is indeed Germanic and it is actually possible to speak English with mostly or entirely dramatic words. For example, instead of saying literature, which is a romance word, you could say book craft or instead of saying ancestor, you could say for Ken, it's not exactly easy to speak that way all the time, but it is possible. There is actually a movement to create and to promote a new form of English like this that stripped of all of its nondramatic influences so that English would basically become the language of would have been if it had not been influenced by romance languages and by Greek and others.

Speaker 2:          01:05          Some people refer to this strictly dramatic form of English as English because it's supposed to take English back to it's Anglo Saxon roots. English as a form of English linguistic purism. English seeks to achieve the Germanic purity of English in a few different ways. First, by choosing existing dramatic words rather than the romance equivalence to by reviving obsolete Germanic words. Three, by adopting words from old English or other Germanic languages for by creating new words based on old English or other Germanic roots. So take this simple sentence. The man forgot his reign shade at home. What do you think? Rain shade means something that provides shade from the rain. If you guessed umbrella. That's right. Rain shade is a new word created from rain and shade, and it's based on the word sunshade. Umbrella is a lone word from Italian umbrella. All of the other words in this sentence, our regular English words of Germanic origin.

Speaker 2:          01:57          And you probably noticed that the words are not changed into old English. They're all in modern English just without the nondramatic elements. Another example, I unlocked the man since he's very isn't. Now here's the original sentence I wrote in standard English. I respect the man because he's very industrious on look comes from old English on lake to observe or regard, but it seems the cents has been extended to me in regard positively or respect. Now, why did I change the word because. Well, because the cause part of because is of romance origin since it's just a dramatic alternative to because it's. There's a real English word which is still used in some dialects of northern England and I believe also in Scotland and of course when I speak of that man who very and I'm referring to a name known show player I've seen on the or a name known show player I've seen on the Farsi year.

Speaker 2:          02:45          Here's the original phrase in standard English, a famous actor I've seen on the television name known as a newly a shaping word that comes from name and known markedly and show player is another melding of two extending words and Farsi or is a likeness of the German word found in everyday talk. We deal with a lot of dramatic words, but for some under warps, like which ship we deal with, many more outland words. In 1989, author Paul Anderson for later well known ritz named unclip dish beholding, which means atomic theory in thoroughly dramatic English without any outland words. Let's take a look at some of that risk. For most of its being mankind did not know what things are made of, but could only guess with the growth of world can we began to learn and today we have a beholding of stuff and work that watching bears out both in the workstead and in daily life being is used instead of existence. World Ken means physics. Beholding means theory. Stuff I believe means matter. Work, I think means energy and workstead means workplace,

Speaker 2:          03:53          the underlying kinds of stuff, or the first stuff's which linked together in sundry ways to give rise to the rest. Formerly we knew of 92 for stuffs from water stuff, the lightest embarrassed to email stuff. The heaviest first stuffs are elements. Sundry means various. This is a regular English word. It's just less common than various water stuff means hydrogen. Barest means simplest and emir stuff means uranium in my wind. This seems like English but somewhat weird. English. English is interesting because by trying to read it or use it, we get a sense of just how much we normally rely on nondramatic vocabulary when we speak English. On the other hand, you learn that it is possible to speak English without any nondramatic words. If you're willing to use some archaic vocabulary or new vocabulary based on Germanic roots. The grammar is the same, so it's mainly a matter of consciously substituting different vocabulary.

Speaker 2:          04:45          So the question of the day, what do you think of linguistic purism like English. Do you think there's any reason to remove foreign influences from a language or do you see those foreign influences as just part of the languages development? Let us know in the comments down below.
