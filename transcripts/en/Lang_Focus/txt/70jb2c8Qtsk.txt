Speaker 1:          00:00          An English speaking Canadian, speaking about Hebrew in Japanese, what the fuck is up with that? How are you doing today guys? This is a video that I've filmed for a different channel, a Japanese channel. Uh, it's a video about the Hebrew language, but it's in Japanese. So it might seem strange to hear me talking about the Hebrew language in Japanese since I'm neither a native speaker of Japanese or Hebrew, but this was for a Japanese audience on another channel. But rather than recreate this whole video in English, I wanted to just put subtitles on it so you can check it.
