Speaker 1:          00:15          Hello everyone. Welcome to the Lange Focus Channel and my name is Paul. Today's topic is how similar our French and Italian, well they're actually very similar. They share a lot of common vocabulary and the grammar is very similar but in terms of phonology they are quite different. So in their spoken form they are generally not mutually intelligible. French and Italian are both romance languages. They both developed out of the vulgar Latin spoken throughout the Roman empire, but French kind of stands out as different from other romance languages. The historical land of goal is located inside Modern Day France and one theory is that when the Roman empire conquered Gaul and tried to force the local population to speak Latin, they spoke at using golish speech sounds and that has affected the phonology and the pronunciation of French. Until this day goldfish was a Celtic language. So that means that there is some Celtic influence in the French language, specifically in phonology and any case, French and Italian are very closely related.

Speaker 1:          01:09          Let's have a look at just how close they are. Vocabulary, Italian and French are very similar in terms of vocabulary. The lexical similarity of the two languages is 89% that means that 89% of the words used have equivalents or cognates in the other language. That doesn't mean the words are exactly the same, but they are clearly related. Some obvious examples, Valenzuela, bon Jordan'll until the song into the Sunday mosaic, monae, Jada, and there are some less obvious cognates to or be dull or medallia order Akella, [inaudible] Yada Shelf Shit. She had a car. Then I think the figure of 89% is probably true if we include formal literary vocabulary, but in daily conversation that seems to be a little lower. Let's look at these examples. Maquila to have Aaliyah, avn, ecomaine, Cucina t prep, our own cafe, Msi, Sita Valisa, viansa vic McDonald cuisine is you're to play pound coffee.

Speaker 1:          02:07          So here you can see that most of the words have an equivalent except for the words that are in red. Those ones are different, like the word for here in Italian it's queen and in French it's see and that were four width. In Italian it's con and in friendships Avec the word for Ian in Italian, it's in and in friendships don't, aside from those words, the other words are all basically equivalent except for a couple of definite articles which are used differently. I recommend that you pause the video now and look at the two sentences along with an English breakdown and see what you notice about the equivalents. Here are another couple of examples in nondomestic rtd and Entrada in an [inaudible] in nuclear power, don't weight loss a magazine, the ceramic, so again, these sentences are quite similar, but a few of the words are different. The mentee, Kathy, that means forget in Italian and who bleah means, forget in French. And again, we see the different words for in the Italian word in and the French word don't. And we see different words for store, the Italian word, niggled steel and the French word magazine. So again, why don't you pause the video and have a look at the two sentences and see what you can learn by comparing them.

Speaker 1:          03:16          So you can see that in a typical sentence. The majority of vocabulary used is similar to the vocabulary used in the other language, but not all of it. Grammar in French and Italian, the word order and the sentence structure are generally very similar. Here's a simple sentence to show. Similar would order. This sentence means I have a newspaper for the trip. He Oh and John anally pedal viaggio j on [inaudible]. And you can see that these sentences are word for word translatable.

Speaker 2:          03:42          Hmm.

Speaker 1:          03:44          But there are also some grammatical differences too. In French subject, pronouns are consistently used, but in Italian subject, pronouns generally aren't used except for emphasis. So in French you ship out lonely. In Italian you will following lazy but yo is not usually said so which just paddling glazer and there's another difference in pronouns in French. The second person, formal end plural pronoun is in Italian. The third person Pronoun Lei is used for the second person formal. So when French we'd have [inaudible] toll on tomorrow, but in Italian [inaudible] so the Italian sentence is like she speaks too slowly, but it should be clear from the context that you are seeing you and not she because you're talking to someone directly. Also in Italian direct object pronouns are also normally attached to the end of a verb. When it's in the infinitive form. In French we'd have shoveled day, but in Italian we'd have eal volume. Rollo negotiation is also a little different. In the two languages. In French we'd say Jeanette backlit phone, glee with no end path to show negation. But in Italian we'd say eo known paddling, Lazy. So in French we have no and pop, but in Italian there's no equivalent of Po.

Speaker 1:          04:58          Those are some little differences. But other major things like the verb tenses are basically the same. French and Italian. Share the same 14 verb tenses. Of course, they're not conjugated exactly the same, but the tense is function in the same way. For example, let's look at how the past tense is formed in French to a mosaic. Elka shows in Italian too. I'm on Jato quelled Coza. This means you ate something spoken to one person informally. The verb consists of two parts. First, the second person, singular form of the word for have and second the past participle. Obviously the forms are different, but the way you use them together to create the past tense is the sin. And just as a quick side note, notice how to say something in the two languages. Kelika shows versus qual. Coza, French and Italian grammar is very similar, just like the vocabulary is largely similar pronunciation.

Speaker 1:          05:45          The biggest difference between French and Italian and the one that prevents mutual intelligibility the most is pronunciation. Italian pronunciation is mostly phonetic and mirrors the written words. Exactly. French words are pronounced from the way they're written, and you have to keep some phonetic rules in mind when pronouncing words. Most Italian words end in a vowel, which makes it easy to pronounce the end of the word. In French, there are many consonants that are usually silent at the end of a word. For example, this sentence meaning the weather is cold in Italian [inaudible] in French in fifth squat. Notice that the d sound at the end of fall is silent. Another example is the phrase for white wine in Italian Vino Bianco in French. Then blown here at the final C is silent, so the last song we hear is the nasal sound represented by in van also ends in a nasal sound.

Speaker 1:          06:33          The end is not pronounced as a consonant here. Instead that nasal aises the proceeding vowel, so rather than Van Blonde, it's van blown. There are also some other sounds that are quite different than French. For example, the French are, it's not the same as the rolled or that you would find in Italian. In Italian, you produce the are by flapping the tip of your tongue against the roof of your mouth, behind your teeth, but the French are as a guttural are that's produced at the back of your mouth. In Italian [inaudible] in French bacteria. So those final silent consonants as well as the nasal sounds of the French are south. Those are some differences with Italian, but there are also some of the things that learners find challenging about French pronunciation. Let's finish by just breaking down a couple more sentences and seeing what similarities and differences we notice.

Speaker 1:          07:18          Here's the sentence, meaning what are your favorite dishes in Italian quality? SONA, we've lost [inaudible]D in French, Kennison Ville, Platte, [inaudible], la, so word by word. The sentence is what are your plural dishes? Plural. Preferred quality and Ken are equivalents. But notice that the plural ending is different. In Italian, it's often eat or act, but in French it's a silent s Somol and some are equivalents. But notice that Somo ends in a vowel while some ends in a nasal sound and a silent t evos three invo are equivalent, but in Italian, the definite article is normally used with a possessive pronoun like votes three. While in French there's no definite article, PRT and Pla or equivalent, but notice the different plural endings and notice that words with I and Italian often have an l in French. We've seen another example of that, the uncle in Italian and blog in French, but if fell, Iti and pressure are obvious equivalents just with different accent markings and a different ending. Now here's one more pair of sentences, but this time I want you to have a look at them and notice the similarities and differences without me breaking it down for you. In Italian he knows three [inaudible] in French and those, I mean finish days unit.

Speaker 1:          08:33          So I hope this video has made it clear just how similar French and Italian really are. The speaker of one of them can probably learn the other quite easily and in writing the level of mutual intelligibility is quite high. But because the cognate words are all a little bit different, and because of the pronunciation of the two languages is so different, the two languages are not mutually intelligible in their spoken form. But as a learner of Italian, my previous knowledge, French makes a lot of things in Italian instantly clear to me. So the question of the day for speakers of French and Italian, how similar do you consider the two languages to be and to learners of French and Italian? Does your knowledge of one of those languages help you make any sense of the other or help you understand the other? Share your experiences in the comments down below.
