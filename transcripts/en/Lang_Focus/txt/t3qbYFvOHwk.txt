Speaker 1:          00:00          Hello everyone. Welcome to the Lange Focus Channel at. My name is Paul. Today's topic is language death. Normally on this channel, when I talk about a language, it's usually a living language, a language that still spoken by native speakers today and continues to grow and evolve, but there are also dead languages and extinct languages. Languages are considered dead when they simply have no more native speakers, even though they may continue to be used in some way. Latin is dead, for example, but it continues to be used for religious purposes and for some administrative purposes in the Vatican. Some people can speak it but not naturally like a native language and it's not passed down as a native language. Another example is Hebrew, which was a dead language before its revival in the form of modern Hebrew. Nobody spoke it natively for a long time, but it continued to be used for religious purposes and as a written literary language.

Speaker 1:          00:55          In contrast, languages are considered extinct when no living person can speak them. For example, if the last remaining speaker of a native American language dies and nobody has learned it as a second language than that language becomes extinct. Likewise, ancient languages like Sumerian are extinct. Some people might be able to read ancient texts in that language, but nobody really uses it today. Languages become either dead or extinct as a result of language, death types of language. Death. Languages don't always die in the same way. There are various types of language death. The most common way that languages disappear is through gradual language death. This normally happens when speakers have one language come into contact with a language of higher prestige, the language of a dominant more powerful group of people. That community may remain bilingual for quite a long time, but with each successive generation, fewer young people speak their traditional language and with lower levels of proficiency as they opt to use the prestige language instead until one day their communities.

Speaker 1:          01:56          Traditional language is no longer spoken. An example of this as corniche, which seems to be spoken by the late 19th century as a result of the growing influence of English and also as a result of the perception of Cornish as a lower class language, even amongst it's own speakers at the time, but cornish is actually not extinct because there are revitalization efforts to encourage people to continue to use that language next bottom to top language death in bottom to top language death. A language ceases to be used as a native spoken language, but continues to be used in certain contexts. Normally in a formal religious context or ceremonial context or perhaps for literary purposes. In gradual language death, the language normally disappears first in more formal contexts as it's replaced by the prestige language, but it continues to be spoken in more casual contexts for a longer time in bottom to top language deaths.

Speaker 1:          02:49          On the other hand, the language dies out at the bottom, in other words, in casual contexts, but it continues to be used in more formal contexts. An example of this is Latin, which is basically no longer used outside of religious ceremonial contexts or perhaps literary contexts. Next, southern language death. Southern language death occurs when all or almost all the speakers of a language suddenly die as a result of a disaster or violence. An example of this took place in the 18 thirties in Tasmania when virtually all of the islands native inhabitants were wiped out by European colonists during the black war. Next, radical language death similar to southern language death, radical language death normally happens very rapidly and normally happens as a result of political repression or under threat of violence. The difference is that the language has speakers are not wiped out, but suddenly stop using their own language as a way to avoid persecution.

Speaker 1:          03:46          And example of this occurred in El Salvador during an uprising in the 19 thirties when many aboriginals abruptly stopped speaking their native languages as a way to avoid being identified as aboriginals and potentially killed two languages that suddenly died out where Linka and case studies. Let's look at a few languages that have already died and see if we could figure out how they ceased to be spoken. Old Church slavonic old church slavonic is the first the tested Slavic language, which was spoken and written between the ninth and 11th centuries. It was a standardized variety of Slavic that was understood by speakers of the various Slavic dialects of that time, which were still quite similar to each other, those slavic dialects, which were basically the colloquial form of the same language, gradually developed into the different Slavic languages of today because it's still used in some churches for religious purposes today, it's a liturgical language, so it fits in with the category of bottom to top language death.

Speaker 1:          04:46          The newly developing Slavic languages replaced the old slavonic dialects as the languages of daily life, but old church slavonic continued to be used for religious purposes and for a certain amount of time for political purposes. It's worth noting that some dead languages never actually died in both the case of Latin and of old slavonic. The language never stopped being spoken. It just continued to evolve into different languages. Leaving the cotified literary language behind as a separate dead language that was no longer spoken, the men then language in 2016, a man named Edwin Benson, the last remaining speaker of the men. Then language passed away. Men. Dan was a native American language of the Sewan language family, which was spoken in the state of North Dakota. The population of men, Dan speakers, was nearly wiped out by an outbreak of smallpox in the seventies and eighties and again in the 18 thirties.

Speaker 1:          05:38          The cohesion of the remaining population was limited by government relocation and the construction of dams which separated villages from each other. While the influence of English group, the fact that most of the population was wiped out in tragic outbreaks of smallpox would place this in the category of southern language death. Even though some speakers of the language continued to live on among the remaining speakers, we can also say that there was an element of gradual language death. As more and more members of that community began to speak the prestige language English until one day, men then was no longer spoken ghoulish up until the sixth century seat. A Celtic language called galesh was spoken in what's now France when the Romans conquered the area, they made Latin the official language of the state and being able to speak Latin became a way to gain status and economic opportunity for a number of centuries.

Speaker 1:          06:28          It was common to be bilingual and golish vernacular and the prestige language Latin until Latin finally replaced golish entirely. This is a clear case of gradual language death as a population gradually gave up their traditional language in favor of the prestige language. A joa between 19, 20 and 1940. The agewell language died out in Nigeria because it's entire community of speakers switched to house up for economic and practical reasons. The entire community very rapidly stopped using their traditional language and it was not passed down to the next generation. This is an example of radical language death when a language dies because all of it speakers suddenly switched to another language. In many cases of radical language, death, the community gives up their language for survival in the face of violence, but in this particular case, they gave up the agewell language because it was more beneficial for their community to speak Hausa.

Speaker 1:          07:23          Why should we care about language death? Some people think that language death is a good thing, that less language diversity is a good thing. For example, the leaders of some countries want one language to be dominant and to replace all of the others because they think that will promote the unity of their country. On the other hand, a language is part of a culture, so when a language dies, part of that culture dies and a unique way of seeing the world dies with it. For example, let's look at the endangered color wire language of Bolivia. Columbia is used by a sect of medicine men who learned the language not only to understand the ritual practice and oral tradition of their ancestors, but also to understand the thousands upon thousands of plant names specific to the callaway or language that explained the medicine will uses of different plants in the local region.

Speaker 1:          08:08          If color disappears, then all of that culture and secret knowledge will disappear with it. Linguistic diversity has been on a steady decline and of the presence nearly 7,000 languages on earth, nearly half are endangered and the top 100 most spoken languages are spoken by 85 percent of the world's population. Some endangered languages are finding new life through revitalization efforts, which require that the language first be recorded and documented, then learned by a new speakers and also used by an enthusiastic and motivated community and having some political influence wouldn't hurt either. The question of the day in your country or in your region, are there languages that are in danger of dying or becoming extinct? How would you feel about those languages disappearing? What's something important be lost? Be sure to follow Lang, focus on facebook, twitter, and Instagram, and once again, thank you to all of my wonderful patrion supporters, especially my top tier patrion supporters whose names are on the screen right now. Very many thanks to them. By the way, on the last video about Tokyo, some of you asked why Toki Pona was listed on the page of patrons and that's because the creator of the Tokyo [inaudible] language has been a patron since last summer, but preferred not to appear on the list, but upon request, I've begun listing the name of the language instead. Thank you for watching and have a nice day.
