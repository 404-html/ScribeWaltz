Speaker 1:          00:00          Hello everyone. Welcome to the Lange Focus Channel and my name is Paul. Today we'll be answering the question how similar our German and Dutch, wait, what were those two languages again? German Deutsche, Dutch Nadir loans. Deutsche. Isn't it strange that English speakers called the language of the Netherlands and Flanders Dutch while German speakers called their own language? Deutsche, why is that? It's because there's a connection between Dutch and German. Both are Germanic. The English word Dutch used to refer to continental Germanic peoples in general, but then came to refer to only the people of the Netherlands because of greater contact and rivalry with them. In particular, the English word comes from the Middle Dutch word do teach and in modern Dutch Dutch, which means German, and this is a cognate of the German word, Deutsche. And with that we've already begun comparing the two languages. In Dutch they say Dutch and in German they say Deutsche.

Speaker 1:          01:01          Germanic and Dutch are both members of the West Germanic branch of the Germanic language family, both developed from the same root, the same ancestor language, Pro Germanic, which developed into Western, eastern and northern dialect groups. The Western dialects are the ancestors of Dutch and German and the other west Germanic languages. One thing we have to keep in mind when comparing Dutch and German is that there are many dialects of Dutch and there are many dialects of German and in northern Germany and parts of Netherlands, there are dialects that arguably form another language, low German or low Saxon, and there's another regional language called Frisian, but speakers of all of these dialects learn either standard Dutch or standard German depending on which country they live in. So there may be cases when German and Dutch speakers understand each other more easily when their dialects are closer to each other, but there are other situations in which their dialects are further apart and it would be easiest to communicate in the standard languages.

Speaker 1:          01:58          In this video, I'll focus on standard Dutch and standard German vocabulary. Dutch and German share a large amount of cognitive vocabulary. According to one source I've seen their lexical similarity is around 84% which is slightly lower than Spanish and Italian or Spanish and Portuguese. 84% lexical similarity doesn't mean that 84% of the words are exactly the same. It means that they are cognates. They come from a common origin, but they may have a different form or be pronounced differently. Some examples, the word for glass in German and in Dutch plus the word for water in German and in Dutch. That or the word for dog, hence the word for brother Buddha, Buddha, but this here is actually an archaic form of the word. The modern form of the word is the word for sister Smith Zoster. This is also an archaic form. The modern form is just, and here are a couple of phrases.

Speaker 1:          03:01          Good Morning Guten Morgen who? Morgan, good day or good afternoon. Guten tag. Who did? Ah, it's sunny, it's sunny. Who dish. There are a lot of cognates like that, but there are false cognates as well. In Dutch. J Means C and Mir means lake in German. Z means lake and mia mean C, but there's actually a bit more to it than that. There's actually a masculine word, desi meaning lake and a feminine word. Dizzy meaning see in Dutch Leeson means to lie as an to tell a lie in German leagon means to lie as in to lie down on a bed. For example, in Dutch listen means to lie on something like a bed in German. Logan means to tell a lie. In Dutch, painless means painful, but in German normally means embarrassing. In Dutch [inaudible] mean it's be allowed to and in German means to like, but hold on a second.

Speaker 1:          04:11          The Dutch word can also be used with the meaning to like specifically when you like a person, the German word is used more generally for people or things you like. So even though a lot of cognates may be obvious or easy to decipher, assuming that they mean the same thing might cause some confusion. Pronunciation, I'm sure you noticed that most of those cognate words sounded a little different and some of them sounded quite different. One of the biggest differences between Dutch and German is the different sounds in either language and how these results in cognate words that sound different. Some of the differences between Dutch and German are a result of the high German consonant shift which took place in the few hundred years leading up to the ninth century. German descends from dialects that were affected by these changes. While Dutch descends from dialects that were not affected by these changes because of the shift, voiceless stops to and come in.

Speaker 1:          05:04          Dutch tend to be fricatives for sup and in German cognates when between vowels or after a vowel at the end of a word for example, the words meaning ship in Dutch skip and in German shoes and the words meaning water in Dutch that are and in German and the Pronoun meaning I in Dutch Ig and in German these same voiceless stops became Africans for sub or at the beginning of a word or if they were doubled consonants or if they came after an l or our sound. For example, the words for apple in Dutch fucking and in German and the words meaning heart in Dutch hearts and in German. The third challenge cup changing to cut occurred only an upper German dialect and not in standard German. Another shift also took place in the voice stops, Buh Duh and gum which became voiceless and cook, but with only the dump to touch shift taking place in standard German.

Speaker 1:          06:13          The other changes only took place in upper German dialects. For example, the word for day in Dutch and in German tack. Remember before when I said that certain German speakers would have an easier time understanding Dutch because of their dialects? Well, that's especially true for low German dialects because like Dutch, they didn't undergo this hydromatic consonant shift. There was another sound change that affected high German but also low German and Dutch thumb and the became duck. This explains why Germans still has a Duh sound even though there was an earlier shift from Dakota. There are also other sound differences that are not a result of the hydromatic consonant shift. Notice the different g sounds in the word for God in Dutch holds and in German the German is more or less like the English good. That Dutch sound varies depending on the region, but as a villa or uvular fricative, you may have also noticed that the wwe sounded different in the words for water, so let's hear those again.

Speaker 1:          07:15          In Dutch Vassar and in German, the German sound is similar to the v sound. In English, the Dutch W is pronounced differently in the beginning or in the middle of the word. It's sort of between a va and the what sounds, but at the end of a word, after a vowel, it's a glide. Just like w in English, our sounds are sounds very quite a lot in either language, depending on where the speakers from, but they're often different in either language. For example, the word for year in Dutch and in German. Yeah, in the Dutch word. The final r sounds like a retroflex approximate raw, like in some varieties of English, but other speakers say it as a trilled are and when it's not at the end of the word, the trilled are, is more consistently used, especially in northern areas and in the German word, the Rs pronounced as a vowel.

Speaker 1:          08:07          It's also pronounced as a vowel. In some other contexts like between vowels or after a long vowel and before another consonant. In other contexts, it's more like a voice to uvular, fricative, ah, at least in a standard accent of Germany. Here's another example using the words meaning rough in Dutch. Here you can clearly hear the trilled are and in German some consonants are spelled the same but sound different. Some are spelled differently and sound different and others are spelled differently but sounded the same. One example is that Czi is spelled as zed in Dutch, but as s in German, German s is also pronounced, so at the end of a word or after consonants other than l and nasals, two words we saw earlier are German and Dutch Zuma. There are many differences in vowels as well. Some are spelled differently, but sound basically the same like the words meaning year that we saw a minute ago. Let's hear those again and focus on the vowel in Dutch and in German. Yeah, notice that the vowel is spelled differently. Another example, the words meaning good in Dutch hoots and in German.

Speaker 1:          09:19          There were also a lot of pairs of cognates in which the vowel sounds have become different and that is reflected in their spelling. For example, their words for dream in Dutch and in German town along o vowel in Dutch often corresponds with this diphthong in German the words meaning body but to cognate with the English word life in Dutch lace and in German. These diphthongs often correspond with each other. Another similar example is the word for bite in Dutch Bayton and in German Bison also notice this German letter that represents the sound sub after long vowels or diphthongs as opposed to a double s after short vowels. This orthographic symbols, it doesn't exist in Dutch, in Dutch, so is always represented by a single s and it's worth noting that this symbol is not used in Swiss standard German either. They always write it as a double s grammar.

Speaker 1:          10:16          There are some important similarities and some important differences between the grammar of the two languages. One difference is their use of grammatical gender. German has three genders, masculine, feminine and Neuter, which applied to announce their articles and adjectives that modify them. Dutch historically had the same three genders, but in practice, in modern Dutch, masculine and feminine essentially form a single common gender. So the only grammatical distinction is between common gender and neuter. And related to that, German has three definite articles. While duck has two and for indefinite articles, German has just two and Dutch has just won. Another difference is that German has nauman cases, different forms of nouns depending on their function in the sentence. The four cases in German are nominative, genitive Datas, and accusative. Dutch used to have now in cases, but they fell out of use in the spoken language and in the 1940s they were dropped from the standard language.

Speaker 1:          11:12          Now they appear and some older idioms, but that's about it. That lack of noun cases arguably makes Dutch easier to learn than German, at least in that particular way. Oh, and remember a minute ago when I said that German has three definite articles. Well, it's actually not that simple. Each definite article has some variations depending on the announced case. Let's look at the nominative and accusative cases. Just to illustrate these sentences mean the red fish is expensive in German and in Dutch, Dutch road as this is dear. As you can see, the sentences can be translated word for word from English. The function of the phrases meaning the red fish is nominative because the subject of either sentence, these sentences mean I like the red fish. In German

Speaker 2:          11:59          marketing [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          12:01          and in Dutch it often the low disease here at the phrases meaning the red fish are the direct object, which means their function is accusative. You can see that in Dutch the noun phrase stays the same despite its accusative function in the sentence, but in German the accusative form is different then. Now that self doesn't have a special ending that's different depending on the gender and the case, but the definite article changes and the adjective has a special ending. When you consider the different case forms for nouns, articles and adjectives, there are a lot of possible combinations. These are for definite noun phrases and these are for indefinite noun phrases. Learning the different cases. Forms has a challenge for learners of German, but if you learn Dutch, you don't have to memorize all those different forms and endings which affect nouns, adjectives, articles, and possessives, et cetera. Word order. In the sentence we just saw the word order was essentially the same in both languages and both were the same as an English. In the following sentences, they share the same syntax, but they're different from English. These sentences mean I can play the piano very well in German

Speaker 2:          13:07          can zack, good, Claudia speedin and in Dutch

Speaker 1:          13:11          ECOM, who's piano spelling word for word? Both sentences are I can. Very good piano play in both sentences. The conjugated verb and auxiliary verb comes second after the subject. Both languages feature Vitu word order and in both languages the unconjugated verb moves to the end for clarity. Let's simplify those previous sentences by removing the adverb phrase, so now they mean I can play the piano.

Speaker 2:          13:37          In German he can clavio spillman

Speaker 1:          13:40          and in Dutch it come pianos Balan. Now let's add something so that they mean, I want to be able to play the piano

Speaker 2:          13:48          in German. [inaudible] via [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          13:52          word for word. It's, I want piano play, be able to, and in Dutch it Kerrville, piano, cleanness, spillane word for word. It's I want piano be able to play in Dutch. When another auxiliary verbus added this auxiliary verb, [inaudible] gets moved back. But the main lexical verb is still at the end. In German, the equivalent auxiliary verb gets moved to the end. After the lexical verb, the same difference occurs in relative clauses. These sentences mean he knows that I can play the piano

Speaker 2:          14:25          in German advice. Does he clubish Billington

Speaker 1:          14:29          word for word, it's he knows that I piano play Ken and in Dutch hiv-aids don't take piano concert and word for word eds. He knows that I piano Ken play. So while the word order is generally similar, there are some differences in the details like that. Let's look at one more final sentence and see what we find. Let's compare two. Meaning if I had enough money, I'd buy a car first in Dutch, Joelton, Alto, copen word for word. It's if I enough money, had wood I uh, car by next in German. Verdad Ishmael, how to them word for word. It's if I enough money, had wood I myself a car by. These are both conditional sentences with two clauses, an if clause and the main clause. First. You might notice that even though I said both languages have Vitu word order, neither of these sentences seem to have verbs in the second position.

Speaker 1:          15:30          In the first clause, the verb comes last and in the second clause the verb comes first. Well this here is the main clause or independent clause. So we should focus on this when thinking about Vitu word order. If this clause alone where the entire sentence than the subject would come first and the verb would come second, making it Vitu word order. This here is the dependent clause. In other words, it's not a sentence by itself. It only adds information to the main clause. So this whole dependent clause occupies the first position and in the main clause, the verb moves before the subject to occupy second position, making it Vitu word order first. We can see that the words for if are different. Then we have the slightly different cognates meaning I hear we have cognate words, meaning enough. Notice that the vowel sound the same but are spelled differently and notice that the letter g looks the same but sounds different in Dutch.

Speaker 1:          16:23          The g sounds are Uvula fricatives ha. Next we have the cognate words for money. The next word is an important one in Dutch. This if clause simply has the past tense form of the verb, heaven meaning to have in German. However, this is a subjunctive verb form something that Dutch doesn't have. Subjunctive forms are used to express hypothetical situations, express doubt or express something you wish were true. Next we see the auxiliary verbs in the main clause which both translate as would the German word is for past subjunctive form of that in and the Dutch word is the past tense of Xulane, which by the way is a cognate of the English word Shell. Notice that in German there's an extra word here. This word is a reflexive pronoun which is used to show that you are buying something for yourself. This is the data form of the first person singular pronoun.

Speaker 1:          17:16          This is not completely necessary but as commonly used in this context. In Standard Dutch, the reflexive pronoun is not used here. Next we have the indefinite articles which are cognates. The German one though is the nuder accusative form. While in Dutch there's only one form of the indefinite article. Next, the word for car is similar. The Dutch word is in the common gender. In other words, historically masculine or feminine. The German word is neuter gender and in the accusative form, but this form takes no special ending to distinguish it for some genders and it does and for others it doesn't. Finally, we see the word for by Copeland in Dutch Kalfen in German, the German consonant sound foot as a result of the hydromatic consonant shift that we talked about earlier and also notice the different vowel sound. There are a lot of similarities between those two sentences we just looked at, but there are also a lot of differences, probably enough for you to realize that to a large extent, German and Dutch are not mutually intelligible.

Speaker 1:          18:16          For people who haven't been exposed to the other very much. Words in isolation or short phrases might be mutually intelligible. But when mixed in with different words and when spoken at full speed, it becomes much harder. And just like with other pairs of closely related languages, speakers of Dutch and German often say that they can understand the other language much more in its written form than in it's spoken form. And like I said earlier in the video, speakers of certain dialects might have a much easier time understanding the other language. The question of the day for native speakers of Dutch or German, how well do you understand the other language and if you've ever studied the other language, what was your experience like and for other people after seeing the examples in this video, what's your impression of Dutch and German? Do they seem very similar to you? Be sure to follow Lang, focus on facebook, twitter and instagram.
