Speaker 1:          00:00          Hello everyone, welcome to the Lange Focus Channel and my name is Paul. Today's topic is the languages of South Africa. The Republic of South Africa covers much of the southern tip of the African continent and as a place where numerous native African cultures as well as former colonial populations have converged resulting in a state of true linguistic diversity. South Africa has 11 official languages that have been recognized in its constitution since 1993. If that seems like a lot to you, you're probably right. South Africa is among the countries with the largest number of official languages at the national level. Number one is actually neighboring Zimbabwe with 16 official languages, some of which are also official in South Africa. These are the 11 official languages of South Africa in order of most spoken to least spoken as a first language, Zulu, Hosa, Afrikaans, English, northern Sudan, Swana, southern Sudan, Tsonga, Swazi, venda, and in the ballet, over 99 percent of South Africans to speak one of these languages as a first language.

Speaker 1:          01:06          All of these languages are members of the southern through branch of the Nigeria Congo language family, with the exception of Afrikaans and English, which are Germanic languages, brought to the country by Europeans. The Dutch first arrived in what is now South Africa in 16, Fifty two establishing the Cape colony in the western portion of the country. Also living in this area were native Koyczan people and other Africans who spoke two languages. The British seized control of the Cape Colony in 18, 15 and British settlers began to arrive. The brewers, the descendants of the original Dutch settlers disliked many aspects of British rule, but one of them was the anglicization of the Cape Colony and the attempt to force English on the horse as a medium of instruction in schools. They wanted to continue to use Dutch as their medium of instruction and to continue speaking. They're distinct dialect of Dutch called Cape Dutch, which would later evolve into Afrikaans.

Speaker 1:          02:00          Boris began the great trek migrating inland and creating their own bore republics in an area more densely populated with African tribes who spoke two languages. The British later took control of the board republics and created the Union of South Africa in 1910 that eventually led to the creation of the Republic of South Africa. From that point on, there were two official languages, English and Dutch, but Dutch as spoken by the boers had evolved into a distinct language called Afrikaans, which replaced Dutch as an official language in 1925. These two colonial languages became the prestige languages of South Africa and Speakers of other languages. Didn't really have any say in the matter. During the apartheid era, schools were segregated not only based on race, but also based on mother tongue. Native speakers of English and Afrikaans were taught in their native language throughout their schooling. With second language instruction in the other official language, black South Africans were required to study in their mother tongue for most of their primary school years after which point then normally studied in English.

Speaker 1:          03:01          But in 1974, the apartheid government implemented a new policy requiring instruction in black schools to be conducted in a 50 slash 50 split between English and Afrikaans. With the language of instruction, depending on the course, this was implemented without consulting the black population in opposition to this move led to the Soweto uprising of 1976. Afrikaans was seen as the language of the oppressor. Since the apartheid government was dominated by white speakers of Afrikaans, while English was seen as a more cosmopolitan language. When apartheid ended in the early 19 nineties, a new constitution was written that added nine additional African languages as official languages in order to be more inclusive of the entire population. The education system now is based on freedom of choice with every individual free to choose which of the 11 official languages to be educated in for the first part of their schooling.

Speaker 1:          03:51          As long as there's sufficient demand for the school to provide it, that means that they don't have to study in their mother tongue if they don't want to. Let's take a look at the map of South Africa. When apartheid was abolished, the four provinces of South Africa and the homelands enclaves for African ethnic groups were abolished and nine new provinces were created. This map shows the most dominant languages in South Africa down to the local level. You can see that the 11 official languages are clustered mainly in certain areas and may predominate in certain provinces, but they don't correspond exactly to provincial borders. You can see that Afrikaans predominates in the West while the [inaudible] language is predominate in the east and English predominates in South Africa's major urban centers. As you can see, there's quite an intricate linguistic situation in the eastern part of the country, so let's zoom in and look at the African languages there.

Speaker 1:          04:42          As I mentioned earlier, the Non European languages of South Africa are mainly members of the southern Bantu branch of the Niger Congo language family, and these account for about 70 percent of the population or around 40 million people. These southern through languages display some features typical of the languages in general. They follow an Svo word order like almost all Bantu through languages. They're tonal and they're are largely a gluten active and feature a large number of affixes to nouns and verbs. Most Ben, two languages do not have click sounds, but many of these southern Bantu language is due as a result of contact with the Koyczan languages. The nine main southern Bantu languages of South Africa can be further categorized into three smaller subdivisions, the in Goonie languages, the languages and the Swat. Ranga or someone, God group vendor forms its own group, so there are actually four subdivisions including this one.

Speaker 1:          05:36          The goonie branch of the southern Bantu tree contains four of South Africa's official languages, Zulu, Olsa, Swazi, and the belay. The first two are the two most spoken languages within South Africa as a first language with Zulu representing 23 percent of the population and wholesale representing 16 percent of it. The other two on the other are spoken by only two point five percent in two point one percent respectively. Zulu is mainly spoken in Kwazulu, Natal, and most of Puma Langa where Swazi and in the belay are spoken as well. Wholesale is the majority language of the Eastern Cape, but has communities have speakers in other provinces as well as other official languages. Do the Goonie languages feature? Click consonants. You can hear one of them in the name of the language. Actually, this is the first time I've tried to pronounce a click consonant, so I may be pronouncing the name of the language wrong from the point of view of a native speaker, but I guess it's something like that whole song.

Speaker 1:          06:36          All of the in Goonie languages are mutually intelligible to a large extent, so to Twana. The second largest of the southern Bantu branches is the [inaudible] branch, which has three languages within it. Northern [inaudible] representing nine point one percent of South Africa's population Swana with eight percent and southern Sudan, or simply with seven point six percent. Altogether. They represent just under a quarter of the population of South Africa, around 13 point 6 million people. Each of these three languages serves as the majority language in the province that it's most widely spoken in southern [inaudible] in the free state, not in the northwest province, and there is also a significant population of speakers in the Northern Cape with which it shares a border and to northern Sudan. In Limpopo, southern [inaudible] contains click consonants due to contact with an Goonie languages. While some urban varieties of northern sue to have in recent times been acquiring clicks as well, it's one that uses some click sounds, but only in interjections and video phones on the metal, for example, and like the Goonie languages, the Twana languages are generally mutually intelligible as well. Tsonga or Swati Rhondda, although there are other languages within this branch, the only one that has official status is Tsonga. Other languages of this group are mutually intelligible and are oftentimes considered part of the tone of the language found in the northeast. Most of the Tsongas speaking, people live in Limpopo or Puma Malanga. Some features click sounds in just a few words. Another interesting phonological feature is whistled sibilant consonants. I haven't been able to find a sample from Tonga, but here's a sample of a similar sound in the [inaudible] language

Speaker 1:          08:27          vendor, one of the less spoken of the official languages in South Africa. Venda comprises two point four percent of the population or one point $3 million speakers who are almost all concentrated on the northern border of Limpopo near Zimbabwe where it's closest linguistic relatives. Live vendor has no click. Sounds okay. Afrikaans and English, the two Germanic languages of South Africa, Afrikaans and English or the third and fourth most spoken languages in the country with 13, five percent and nine point six percent of citizens speaking them as their first language respectively. People outside of South Africa might assume that native speakers of Africans are all white, but that's not the case. It's the majority language in the Northern Cape. Then Western Cape provinces where most of the nation's colored population or mixed race population lives and more than 75 percent of colored South Africans speak Afrikaans as their first language. Why is that?

Speaker 1:          09:22          It's because they were part of the language is development. The origin of the colored community lies in the early days of the colony. When Dutch settlers intermarried with indigenous Koyczan women or slaves from Africa, India and Southeast Asia, but they also interacted linguistically and by learning Dutch in perfectly as a second language. They influenced the direction of the Dutch dialect that would evolve into Afrikaans. It's also spoken as a native language by smaller numbers of the South Asian and black South African populations and it's spoken by over 60 percent of the white population as a native language in total. It's the first language of about 13 point five percent of the population and it's spoken by an even larger number as a second language. If you haven't seen my language profile on Afrikaans from a couple of years ago, you can check it out right here. English is spoken as a native language, mainly in the Western Cape, how attain and Zulu natal as these are aware of the major cities can be found.

Speaker 1:          10:17          Plus it's widely spoken as a second language, English as the native language of nine point six percent of the population, including around 36 percent of the white population. It's also the native language of most Indian South Africans. They speak with an accent distinct from white South Africans, speakers of English during the apartheid era, interaction with whites was limited, which allowed their own distinct variety of English to develop in isolation with some fun, illogical influences from Indian languages. I've mentioned the Koyczan languages a few times and you may be wondering why they aren't on the list of official languages. Well, the Koyczan where the first indigenous people have much of South Africa before the migration of Ben to peoples and later Europeans through conflict with Ben too, and Europeans Koyczan were driven into a much smaller area and now most Koyczan live in the Kalahari desert. Some Koyczan intermarried with Europeans and became part of the colored population while others died from conflict and disease.

Speaker 1:          11:17          The end result of all this is that only a very small population of Koyczan remain in South Africa and their Koyczan languages are therefore not widely spoken and are not official languages. Koyczan languages do not form a single language family and are not accepted as being related to each other, but all of them feature extensive use of click consonants. As I stated before, the click sounds used. [inaudible] languages come from contact with Koyczan languages. The most widely spoken Koyczan language in South Africa is [inaudible] or [inaudible] with around 50,000 speakers. This language has an additional 250,000 speakers in neighboring Namibia. There are other Koyczan languages in South Africa that are severely endangered like Greek, well with only a few dozen speakers remaining language in society. In a society with such linguistic diversity, it's inevitable that the majority of the population will be bilingual or multilingual. Most white and colored South Africans are bilingual and English and Afrikaans and a smaller number of speak, one of the African languages as well, Indian South African speak English and usually some Afrikaans and some speak in Indian language as well.

Speaker 1:          12:27          Typically, older people, many black South Africans speak three, four, five, or even more languages. It's common for them to speak their native African language, English and Afrikaans and one or more other African languages. They're often able to speak the other languages, have the same sub group as their native language because they're closely related and in many cases mutually intelligible. You may be wondering if the languages within each subgroup or mutually intelligible, why are they considered separate languages? Well, what does a language versus what is a dialect is a murky issue as always, but I think it's partly because they each have their own standardized variety and it's partly because each one is associated with a distinct ethnic group. These days, business and politics are emotionally conducted in English and English as the most common language of broadcast and media for a long time. English and Afrikaans had equal status as dual lingua.

Speaker 1:          13:19          Franca is of South Africa, but Afrikaans has been declining in that regard. That's partly due to the stigma attached to off recons as it's seen as the language of apartheid. In addition to that, education in South Africa tends to lean toward English. In typical South African schools, the first three grades are taught in the student's mother tongue, but after that school work is conducted in either Afrikaans or English. Schools can teach in the native language longer, but since secondary school matriculation exams are only conducted in English and Afrikaans. There's a strong motivation to switch to one of those languages early on, but rather than Afrikaans most choose English due to its utility and prestige and in many cases families will forego students being taught in their first language and go straight into English to jumpstart their proficiency, but whether this is a help or a hindrance is a source of much debate.

Speaker 1:          14:11          The emphasis on English and Afrikaans after the first three or four years of initial schooling is a lasting influence of the colonial era. Today there are 11 official languages and in theory and in law they are equal, but in practice, English and Afrikaans are still the most influential languages at the national level, and this is still the case for now, despite the fact that Africans has lost some of its prestige. The question of the date for South Africans, which languages do you speak and in what situations do you use them and for other people, how many official languages are there in your country? Do you think that system works well for your country? Be sure to follow lane, focus on facebook, twitter, and Instagram, and once again, thank you to all of my wonderful patrion supporters, especially these ones on the screen who are my top tier patrion supporters. Many thanks to them as always and to everyone. Thank you for watching and have a nice day.
