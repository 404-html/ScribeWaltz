Speaker 1:          00:00          Hello everyone. Welcome to the Lange Focus Channel and my name is Paul today. This is not a feature video. This is just a special video in which I'm going to make a little announcement and then I'm going to answer some frequently asked questions that a lot of people ask me in the comments of videos and also in private messages. So the first announcement that I want to make is that I have created a patriotic account. Now maybe you don't know what Patrion is. Patrion is a service that allows you to basically support your favorite youtube creators by pledging to give them a certain amount of money each month and amount of money that you decide. Now I want to say right away, you don't have to do this. You don't have to give any money. This is basically like a voluntary subscription feed that you can pay if you want, but the amount is up to you so it can be as little as $1.

Speaker 1:          00:50          That's one of the cool things about Patrion is that everyone can give just $1, not everyone, but if you want, you can give $1 and if a lot of people give $1, then that amount of money kind of adds up in the creator gets, you know, a significant amount. So that's the cool thing about it. It's kind of a collective way to support your favorite creators as a team. So the reason I'm doing that is because I've put in a lot of time and effort into making the videos and basically that's a lot of time that I could be putting into different work that pay money. I do get a little bit of money from some advertising on youtube, but it's just a small amount. It's not really a lot, uh, because according to my statistics, about 70% of people use ad blockers and that's okay.

Speaker 1:          01:32          I don't really mind if you do that. That's up to you. Of course, this is all voluntary. If you want to support the channel, Patrion is a way to do that. Even if you like to use an ad blocker or whatever, things like that. Basically have a look at the Patrion page that I've created. If you think that Lang focus deserves a little donation every month, a dollar or whatever you want to give them, that would be highly appreciated. But if not, then don't worry about it because I'll still love you just as much. She'll still be a valued viewer and all of that, so don't even stress about it. It's completely voluntary. And the link to that Patrion page is down below in the description. So onto a few frequently asked questions. So the first frequently asked question is, Paul, how many languages do you speak?

Speaker 1:          02:15          Now this is a strange question to be asked because it kind of feels like, because I'm making the videos that people think I'm a language master or a language guru or one of those things, and I don't think of myself like that. I don't think I'm a language master. I'm just someone who's very passionate about languages and very interested in them. And I'm also very passionate about learning because the teacher, but also I just love learning. But I know why people are asking that question. So I'll try to give you my answer. I'll, I'll tell you which language is that. I've basically invested a lot of time into studying that. I've studied in depth in that I have a significant amount of knowledge of it doesn't mean I'm really advanced that those languages, but it means I put that time and effort into them. So the first one that I studied back in the day was Hebrew.

Speaker 1:          02:58          In University I studied biblical Hebrew, but in my free time I also studied modern Hebrew. I also studied biblical, Aramaic and university and at the same time I studied old English or Anglo Saxon. So we can throw that in there and it's not a spoken language, but I'll throw that in there. I've also studied Arabic, I studied modern standard Arabic and also some Arabic dialects, specifically Palestinian and to some extent Egyptian as well. I've also of course studied Japanese. As you might know, I live in Japan and I've been studying Japanese for a long time. I've also studied Indonesian. I've also studied French. I've also studied tagalog. I've also studied Esperanto and I've also recently been studying Italian. So those are the ones I've really put time and effort into studying quite a lot. I don't know if I'm forgetting any, but uh, that's probably the main ones.

Speaker 1:          03:45          There are other languages that I've studied to a basic level, but I don't really know them enough to say that I know them. And there are some languages that I can also read. Like I have passive knowledge of them because I've studied related languages, but I've never specifically studied those languages themselves. So for example, Portuguese and Spanish, I can, I can often make sense to them when I'm reading them, but I've never studied them. There are also other languages that I've just studied from a linguistic point of view. Like I want to see how those languages work. So I examined them and sometimes the language profile videos I make are kind of like that. Like I'm just interested in those languages. So I examine them and study and learn about those languages. But I haven't necessarily studied those languages. Basically I consider myself a language, enthusiasm, someone who loves languages.

Speaker 1:          04:29          I don't call myself a polyglot. I'm not going to make a video called Canadian guys speaks 25 languages or something like that. Like that's not really the purpose of this channel. That channel is called Lang focus because I want to focus on the languages and not really on me and my own ability. Another frequently asked question I get is Paul, what do you do for a living? Is it related to languages? Well, yes, kind of a, I'm an instructor at a university and I teach English as a foreign language to students in Japan. So originally part of the reason I made the length focus channel was kind of to inspire my students so I have some videos to show them and I could show them that my hobby is language learning and I could give them some extra motivation to work hard to study English because they could see that their teacher is doing that to another frequently asked question I get is Paul, what's your educational background?

Speaker 1:          05:17          Well, I have two university degrees. My first university degree was in English with a linguistics focus. So it wasn't a literature degree. It was a linguistics degree in the English department. So that means I studied the history of English, I studied English grammar, I studied English phonology, I studied a dialectal differences in English. I studied all of those kinds of things about the English language. I also had a minor in religious studies. Basically all of my credits that went towards that minor where courses in biblical Hebrew and Biblical Aramaic. I wanted to study those languages and I figured out that I could get a minor in religious studies by just taking those courses. So that's what I did. I also have a second university degree that one is in education. So after I finished my first degree, I went back to university and did a second degree in education and that's what allows me to be a teacher and do my current job at the university. So let's just a little bit about me. It seems like some of the viewers want to get to know a little bit more about me personally. If you're one of those people, you can check out my instagram too, like gives you a little bit of a glimpse into my life, my daily life, and you can follow me on facebook as well and all of those different social media channels. So thank you for watching. Have a nice day.
