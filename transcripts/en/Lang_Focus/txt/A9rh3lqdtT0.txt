Speaker 1:          00:00          Hello everyone. Welcome to the Lange Focus Channel and my name is Paul. Today we'll be discussing the question how similar our metropolitan French and Quebec French or Quebecois. In other words, how similar is the French spoken in France to the French spoken in Quebec. French is one of the world's major languages and it's spoken in dozens of different countries and everywhere that it's spoken, the standard variety or the formal variety that's learned at school and used in the media is essentially the same as metropolitan French based on the Parisian variety of French in informal speech. However, there is some variation with local differences in accents and vocabulary. There's one major variety of French that is particularly distinct from Metropolitan French, and that is the French chef Quebec, a culturally distinct French speaking province in Canada. French speakers from France often say that they have trouble understanding the French spoken in Quebec.

Speaker 1:          00:51          I should point out that the formal variety of French Houston, Quebec is virtually identical to metropolitan French. The differences lie in the informal varieties of Quebec and an informal speech. There can be a considerable amount of difference, but why is Quebec French distinct from Metropolitan French? The reason lies in the settlement of new France and the later isolation of Quebec from France. New France was an area in North America that was colonized by France before the creation of Canada and the United States, the first settlers in new France. We're not mainly from the Paris area, but from regions like Normandy and Brittany were regional sister. Languages of French lung doyle were spoken rather than French itself, but since French settlers were outnumbered by English settlers, the King of France, King Louis the 14th sent female settlers mainly from the Paris area to help bolster their numbers through marriage and childbirth.

Speaker 1:          01:41          Since these women were mainly from the Paris area, they brought with them their Parisian variety of French, which contributed to the decline of the regional languages and the adoption of French among the settler population. And of course the interaction between speakers of different regional languages encouraged the use of French as a Lingua Franca. As a result. The language that developed in new France was similar to the language spoken by the king and the aristocracy, but was also influenced by the regional languages of the settlers. The French language became adopted throughout the various regions of France. Later after the French Revolution of the late 18th century, the variety of French that became the new widespread standard language was not the French of the king and the aristocracy, but rather the French of the bourgeois class who led the revolution prior to the French Revolution. New France had already been conquered by the British in 1760 and it's elite had returned to France.

Speaker 1:          02:34          The British soon decided to allow the French speaking population in what is now Quebec to continue using their language as a way to prevent them from joining the American revolution against the British, which was taking place to the south. Come back, therefore remained under British rule, but was isolated from France. The French language in Quebec began developing in its own direction. While the French spoken in France developed in its own direction. The vocabulary. The vocabulary of Quebec French differs from that of Metropolitan French in several ways. First, the two varieties of French have taken in loan words from English during different time periods. The French of Quebec was infused with English vocabulary during the period from 1850 to 1960 for example, the word for job in Quebec, French there is in metropolitan French in Quebec, French weird and Metropolitan French visa. In Quebec, French there's chum meaning a male friend or a boyfriend and in metropolitan French that would be me or the coupon in Quebec, French, there's fun in metropolitan French, it's a museum.

Speaker 1:          03:42          Fun also appears in the phrase, which is a direct translation of the English expression to have fun. In Metropolitan French, it would be send Musey expressions like this are called calcs or lone translations. Another example is this is translated from English that makes sense. In metropolitan friendship would be sad. You songs and then Quebec French people say to me, you're welcome, but in metropolitan French they would say, do the young. The old venue means welcome in all varieties of French, but not your welcome in response to thank you. Note that these are informal Quebecois words, which are not considered proper and formal Quebec French, which mirrors the standards of Metropolitan French. Since 1960 there have been French language protection laws in Quebec and the general distaste towards English systems. Metropolitan French, on the other hand, doesn't have the same protective attitude, and in recent decades has been more influenced by English, so it contains recent English loan words that are not used in Quebec.

Speaker 1:          04:45          For example, in metropolitan French, they say email, but in Quebec, French they say, all right, cool. In Metropolitan French, there's fun. In Quebec they say stop signs in France, say, stop. This is not really a part of the French language. It's just an international used street sign. But in Quebec, the sign say another aspect of vocabulary that differs is that there are some words or expressions in Quebec, French that seem older or more traditional to speakers of metropolitan French. The Quebecois word for shoes is in metropolitan French. It's detial sue the Quebecois word for car or Shell. In France, it's [inaudible]. In France, Shar means tank as in tank of war. Another example is the way to say I miss you in Quebec, it's [inaudible] in France. That would sound rather old fashion and the way people would usually say it is [inaudible].

Speaker 1:          05:46          The French of Quebec also contains numerous slang expressions and swear words that are taken from the Catholic religion. Perhaps the most famous where word of Quebec is. Others include car lists, meaning chalice, a c meaning host or communion bread. These words are only offensive and Quebec and nowhere else in the Francophone world as far as I know, and the French of Quebec has also just developed some of its own vocabulary and expressions. For example, to go shopping in Quebec, friendships in metropolitan French, it's cld, Kooks Clg, shipping grammar written French in Quebec is grammatically identical to metropolitan French, but an informal speech you might hear some differences in grammar too is used after verbs as a yes or no question marker that's in blown. This means, do you have a girlfriend in metropolitan French [inaudible]? [inaudible].

Speaker 1:          06:41          Notice here that is being used as a yes or no question marker and not as a pronoun. Also notice the Quebecois word for girlfriend bloomed. This means is it ready in metropolitan French. That would be sip. Sam Is cusip saying here, notice that the subject is third person. To be clear too is nothing but a question marker here. It's not the second person Pronoun too. It's also used for emphasis or exclamation. See, that's so shocking. Seats. You should come next. In Quebec, French cook is used as the relative pronoun more often than in metropolitan French. Just Shush. I leave Casey business. This means I'm looking for the book that I need in metropolitan French. This would be [inaudible] and in a sentence with an embedded question. In Metropolitan French you use a relative pronoun, but in Quebec French the interrogative pronoun is used. Should I say this means I do what I want in metropolitan French [inaudible] next in Quebec French.

Speaker 1:          07:49          The explicit subject of a sentence is often said as a tag with a pronoun as the subject in the main clause. For example, mall bus. This means my boss makes me so angry. Notice how the subject, my boss is set aside at the beginning separate from the main clause and then the Pronoun e which is a contraction of eel appears in the main clause in metropolitan French. This would be in Quebec, French pla towards mound. This means his plan is to travel around the world. In metropolitan French it would be so pushy ewg. This type of tag is also used in metropolitan French but as much more common in Quebec, French. Next there are some differences in imperative forms in Quebec French. This means tell me or tell it to me. In Metropolitan French denim you can see that the object Pronoun La is positioned differently and now the negative form in metropolitan French in the deeper you can see that in the negative, the syntax is quite different.

Speaker 1:          08:59          In Metropolitan French, the object Pronoun Ma is used instead of the French emphatic Pronoun Wa often pronounced where in Quebec, and it comes before the verb as does the object Pronoun Look in Quebec, French, they come after the verb as they do in the affirmative accent. Probably the biggest difference between the French of Quebec and Metropolitan France simply lies in accent without previous exposure to the French spoken in Quebec. French speakers from Europe typically have trouble understanding it, and this differs depending on the socioeconomic background and the region of the speaker. The consonants are not so different for the most part, but there are some differences in Quebec, French before the vowels e and Oo, the consonants to enter become enza gg. Whereas in metropolitan French it's pronounced two d. There are several different rotate sounds used throughout Quebec, including trill sounds as opposed to the Uvula fricative of Metropolitan French.

Speaker 1:          09:58          However, this is also true in France where some regional accents have trills rather than fricatives and in Quebec in formal speech and in many areas, the uvular fricative is also used. So the situation in Quebec and Francis similar except that in France, the shift towards the uvular fricative is more advanced vowels. One difference is that nasal vowels are quite different. In Quebec, French, there's CAF, and in metropolitan French there's another difference is that in Quebec, French, long vowels and nasal vowels become diphthongs in open syllables. So in Quebec, French we have fights, but in metropolitan French there's sit in Quebec, French, we have pi in metropolitan French, it's damn related to that. Quebec French retain some long vowels from older French that have become short in metropolitan French. For example, in metropolitan French, these two words sound the same mate mate, but in Quebec, French, they don't.

Speaker 1:          10:59          My Net, these are just a couple of examples, but there are numerous distinctions like these intervals. Some words also become contracted in Quebec, French, for example, sue meaning on followed by a definite article, gets contracted sill say, now let's look at a few sentences to compare. Here's the sentence, meaning I fell in love with her because she's beautiful in Quebec. French. She tell him down that I called Kenny van and in metropolitan French she vm Udin Pascali Bill. Here we can see a quebecois expression Tome Bay on the Moon [inaudible], which is a calc of the English expression fall in love with, and here we see two different phrases, meaning because I called Tsca is an older phrase, which is obsolete and metropolitan French, but it's still used in Quebec. Another pair of sentences. This time they mean I want to go out with my friends on the weekend

Speaker 2:          11:59          in Quebec, French off to Hong Gang, often salmon

Speaker 1:          12:03          and in metropolitan French [inaudible] weekend in the Quebec French sentence we see on gun, which means with a group of friends or colleagues. This phrase is strictly a Quebecois phrase, so when Metropolitan French you'd say something like, evict me. Awesome. Next we see the phrase of fantasy man, which means on the weekend in metropolitan French, the usual term is the weekend or in this context, so weekend. This is an [inaudible] that has not entered Quebec French due to its language protection efforts in metropolitan French. Someone might say, fend to some man, but to refer to the end of the workweek like Thursday, Friday before the weekend. Now let's look at one last pair of sentences. This time they mean I'm going to park the car here and ride my bike

Speaker 2:          12:49          in Quebec, French. Should we be back? It'll show you see your motives

Speaker 1:          12:53          and Metropolitan French choosy guide of which you receive a porn movie loo. Here we see a uniquely Quebecois phrase park in the Shah with the verb that comes from the English word park and again we see the word Sha meaning car and notice that the words for bicycle are different in Quebec, the common word is BC clit. This word isn't a lone word from English. In fact, it appeared in French before the word bicycle appeared in English. It's a standard French word, but is generally considered old fashioned to speakers of metropolitan French who mainly use the word veilleux. As we've seen, the French of Quebec has a number of different features that distinguish it from metropolitan French, but it seems to me that people sometimes exaggerate these differences. There are significant differences in accent, but that seems like something that would cease to be much of a problem with significant exposure to it.

Speaker 1:          13:43          In terms of vocabulary, Quebec has its own informal expressions and slang, but so do other French speaking areas including Paris in terms of grammar, there are some little things here and there but nothing too shocking. And of course formal French in Quebec is very close to formal French in France, albeit with a different accent. The question of the day for native speakers of French from Quebec, from your point of view, how different is your variety of French from the French spoken in Europe and for native speakers of French from Europe? How well can you understand the French spoken in Quebec and for learners of French, assuming that you're learning metropolitan French, what do you think of the French spoken in Quebec? Is it hard to make sense of?
