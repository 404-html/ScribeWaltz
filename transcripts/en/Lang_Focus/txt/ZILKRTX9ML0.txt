Speaker 1:          00:16          so you might be thinking, what the heck does meditation have to do with language learning? Well, it has a couple of big benefits that can really affect your results, so I wanted to share it with you. It's something that I do all the time, but I want to make clear that this is not religious meditation. If you have your own religion and you're worried that maybe this is Buddhism or some other religion that uses meditation. No, I'm not teaching you that. I'm just talking about how to relax your body and also your mind so that you can focus and learn more efficiently. Alright, well let me talk about some of the benefits that meditation has for your language learning. One of them is that it puts you in an ideal learning state, puts you in something called an Alpha state, which means that your brain waves are moving at a slower speed than they are when you normally go throughout your day. When you normally go about your day, you are in a Beta state in your brain, waves are moving.
