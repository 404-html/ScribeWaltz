Speaker 1:          00:00          What was today's topic? I forgot. Oh, right. Hebrew. No. Uh, Arabic.

Speaker 2:          00:19          Hm.

Speaker 1:          00:21          Oh, right. I've heard of that one. What was it? Uh, American.

Speaker 3:          00:25          Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:30          Hello everyone. Welcome to the Lange Focus Channel and my name is Paul. Today's topic is the m horic language or Ahmadinia as it's known in Amharic. I'm Horak is one of the major languages of Ethiopia and it's the official working language of the Ethiopian federal government. Regional and local authorities are free to choose their working language in Ethiopia, but I'm horic is the working language of several regions. According to the 2007 census, it's the native language of 22 million people or around 30% of the population of 74 million. But over the last 10 years, the population of Ethiopia is thought to have surpassed 100 million. And the number of native Amharic speakers is probably over 30 million. But Ethiopia is a country where many people are multilingual and millions. More people speak Amharic as a second language, especially in cities and towns. Am horic is a member of the Semitic language family, which also includes Hebrew, Arabic, Aramaic, and the t gray and too granule languages which are spoken in Ethiopia and Eritrea all Semitic languages developed from the theoretic Prodo Semitic language.

Speaker 1:          01:40          The ethiopic or ECO Semitic languages are part of the South Semitic branch and the most common theory is that all Ethio Semitic languages including I'm horrific, developed from a common Prato Ethio Semitic language. This Prato Ethio Semitic language is thought to have developed from the language of migrants from Southern Arabia, presumably old south Arabian languages. These migrants intermixed with the native people who spoke who schick languages and Prodo Ethio Semitic arose. This language was a direct descendant of the language of the migrants from this protal Ethio Semitic language. Two branches developed the southern branch, which includes I'm horic and the northern branch, which includes t gray to [inaudible] and gaze, the oldest attested Ethio Semitic language and the one that became the official language of the [inaudible] empire and remained the official literary language in Ethiopia until the 19th century. Some believe in that theory of migration from Southern Arabia. But some believe that I'm horic developed from a Semitic language that had existed in the area before that migration.

Speaker 1:          02:43          And in recent years, another theory has arisen that I'm horic is actually a creole that arose from contact between Semitic speaking officers and cush should expediating soldiers in the accent might empire after the fourth century. But this theory is hotly contested and is not the general consensus. The earliest known am Horak writing is from the 13th century, even though it was mainly a spoken language at that time. This was the time of the solomonic dynasty when King, no, I'm luck, made Amharic, the spoken Lingua Franca of the Ethiopian courts, and it became known as the language of the king to sign a new goose gaze. The language of the previous x amount rulers continued to be used as the language of literature. The sonance oof. This resulted in a diagnostic situation that would last for centuries with gays being used from literature and did the Ethiopian Orthodox Church. And I'm Horak being used in speech in the 15th century under the rule of Zadie Yacob troops who collected taxes for the king likely brought em horic into other regions.

Speaker 1:          03:44          Further south in the mid 19th century am Horak began to replace a gaze as the literary language case in point, the Ethiopian Emperor's tail, just the second and mindy leak. The second had their chronicles written in Amharic rather than gaze, which had been used for previous emperors under mini leak. The second Ethiopia grew into something resembling its current borders am Horak became the defacto official language and emhart speaking officials were responsible for the newly incorporated territories. The spread of the printing press in the 19th and 20th centuries contributed further to the spread of Mri as in the 20th century. Most new print materials including the first newspaper, were written in an pauric rather than gays. In the early 20th century, Italian, French and English were used as the main languages of school instruction. But then in 19:44 AM horic became the sole language of instruction in primary schools under the rule of Haile Selassie.

Speaker 1:          04:39          He then made them Horak the official language of Ethiopia in 1955 during the socialist government known as the deck from 1974 to 1991 increased development, urbanization and an increase in the number of public schools and adult literacy programs caused them horic to spread even more, but still empiric was much more widely spoken in towns and cities and not as widely spoken in rural areas except in its original native regions. After 1991 language policies were changed to give more influenced to the other languages of Ethiopia and there are over 80 of them currently regional and local authorities can choose their own working language and their own language of primary school education. But Amharic remains the most widely spoken Lingua Franca with a large proportion of the urban population throughout the country being able to speak Amharic. So what does, I'm Horak like first of all, what's this interesting script that I'm Horak is written in?

Speaker 1:          05:34          Well that's actually the gay script, which is used not only to write the gays language, but also amharic to Grenada and others. The gay script is an Abogada. Each character represents a syllable and consists of a consonant as its major components plus an attached ligature or other modification that represents a vowel in Amharic. This gaze based writing system is called [inaudible] and I'm Horak. There are plain consonants similar to most of the consonants in English, and there are glottals sized consonants or ejective consonants. Globalized consonants are produced by closing and reopening the gladys the space between your vocal chords while making the consonant sound. When transliterated using Latin characters, they usually have a dot underneath them to distinguish them from their non globalized equivalents. Let's compare a plane consonant with it's globalized equivalent to Teta. Also notice the doubled consonant. All consonants can be short or long, long meaning that the consonant is doubled double in length.

Speaker 1:          06:37          The distinction between short and long consonants is important because sometimes the meaning of words is distinguished by the length of the continent. For example, this means he said this means there is, this means swimming one, Nah, this means important, so in both cases, the length of the consonant distinguishes the meaning of the words doubled. Consonants are not distinguished in writing, but in context amharic speakers have little trouble with that sentence structure. First, let's look at an equational sentence using the verb to be you jus a Gel. No, this means the boy is short word for word, it's boy. The short is Ou is a definite article is boy you is the boy. Notice that the verb to be is at the end and the adjective comes before it. Amharic is a verb. Final language. So when predicate of sentences, the word order is sv or Ovi or Sov. Of course some sentences have no object just to subject and an intransitive verb. For example, did you? What the sentence means? The child fell word for word. It's child, Duh. He fell. So this is the subject and this is the verb and here's a sentence that does have a direct object.

Speaker 1:          07:57          It means that the hunter killed Elian word for word. It's hunter, the lion he killed. Here's the subject, the object and the verb. Something we can add to this sentence is the optional direct object marker. Good Delta. If you use the direct object marker, then it's also possible to place the object at the beginning of the sentence, making it, oh sv. Good. And now let's try adding an adjective to the sentence I knew to look good. Dead. The sentence now means the hunter killed a big lion and you can see that the adjective is placed before the noun. The previous sentences all have an explicit subject, but there can also be no explicit subject. For example, this sentence meaning he opened the door that rune [inaudible] word for word, it's door direct object marker. He opened. No explicit subject is necessary here because we know from the form of the verb that it refers to the third person, masculine, singular. He. So this sentence is just olvey object, verb. And that brings us to verbs similar to an other Semitic languages. The verb consists of a stem and suffixes, which indicate the person, gender, and number of the subject. Let's take a look at this example. Verb meaning to break. Here's the stem of the perfect form and the suffix is placed after the stem. Tell us about the doer of the action.

Speaker 4:          09:19          Sebesta sub sub, sub sub sub borough Sabera to sub Barron.

Speaker 1:          09:30          Now let's look at the imperfect form based on this stem.

Speaker 4:          09:33          You said Rod to [inaudible] to [inaudible], [inaudible], [inaudible], [inaudible], [inaudible], [inaudible], [inaudible],

Speaker 1:          09:44          the root system. Let's take a look at the stems of the perfect form and the imperfect form again, and let's focus on these letters here. Similar to an other Semitic languages. I'm Horak uses a system of root letters and templates into which the root letters are inserted. Roots consist of consonants commonly three, but it can also be two, four or five and they are placed into templates consisting of a vowel pattern as well as some continental affixes. The root gives us the core meaning and the template gives us grammatical information and more specific information about the meaning. Notice that with this verb, the second route letter is doubled or germinated in the perfect form. This is true for some verbs but not for others. Those are a few of the important features of them. Horic. Let's look at a few more example sentences and see what else we find.

Speaker 1:          10:31          Here's the sentence, meaning we must go today. Study. Made a Leben word for word. It's today to go. We must, in this sentence, we see a modal verb meaning must just like other verbs. This modal verb is conjugated for the subject. In this case, we, the modal verb comes at the end and before that we see the main verb meaning to go in. It's infinitive form another sentence. How can you meet [inaudible]? This means where can I find a doctor? [inaudible] word for word, it's doctor. Where is found? The word Hakeem is the same as the Arabic word for doctor and I would guess that this is a lone word. This word means where question words usually come directly before the verb and you can see that the object of the verb comes first. This is an imperfect verb with these root consonants. The ethics is showed that this is the third person singular forum.

Speaker 1:          11:22          And onto the next sentence, you're making a good of still being at this means I've lost my car keys work for words of car. My key have been lost to me. This pattern here of plus a noun plus another. Now is a typical way of showing possession or connection between two nouns, and this is a verb with these two root consonants, which mean to lose, but this particular verb template makes it reflexive or intransitive. So what means to be lost? This is the conjunct form of the which can be used like the present perfect in English and this ending here, I mean something like happened to me showing that the speaker is affected by the action. Notice that in this sentence, the word for key is singular. Plural can often be understood from the context even if you're used the singular form, but we can also use an explicit plural form of Tau Vignette.

Speaker 1:          12:15          Again, this means I've lost my car keys, but here you can see that a plural ending has been added to the word for key, but it's not entirely necessary to use the plural form. You can use the singular form and it context. It should be clear whether you're talking about just one or many and onto the next sentence and Magoo and no deadline. This means we love Ethiopian cuisine. Word for word, it's of Ethiopia food we love. Again, we see that pattern showing possession or relationship between two nouns and here we see the imperfect form of the verb, meaning to love. Here's the stem and she wrote the affixes telling us that this is first person plural. In other words, the we form and one more sentence that it took going, that's a better outcome. This means I didn't break the vase that it going.

Speaker 1:          13:02          That's a better word for word. It's veys. I broke negative conjugation in Amharic, there's a special negative perfect form of verbs. The negative form is made by adding this prefix and the suffix to the regular perfect for them. And here's the word for veys and here are the definite article suffix, but since it's following another vowel, it's written as well rather than Ooh as a Semitic language, amharic has some vocabulary that overlaps with other Semitic languages like Hebrew and Arabic. Some of the similar words are loan words from other languages like Arabic or gays, but some are cognates that develop from a common ancestor as the words and other Semitic languages. And sometimes it's hard to know if the word is a lone word or an original cognate. For example, the word we saw before, which means break the same. The third person, perfect form and Hebrew would be Shavaya and in Hebrew sometimes the second route letter like a v sound is doubled and pronounced like a b sound, which makes the similarity even more obvious.

Speaker 1:          14:02          And we also solve the work to kill. This is the third person. Perfect form. In Hebrew, it's cattal meaning to slay or to kill. In Arabic, it's clicky law. The consonants here are not exactly the same, but I think there's a connection between the g sound in Amharic and the cup or sounds in the other languages. And I think there's a connection between the de and the sounds in the other languages. Another example, the word for Berry in Hebrew, it's havas and an Arabic of butter in Amharic. The verb meaning to here is sem, and this is the third person. Perfect form, meaning he heard in Hebrew, it's Shama in Arabic, it's some off in Hebrew and Arabic. There's an extra route letter that was lost in the [inaudible] word and it has mostly become silent and modern Hebrew but still written and I'm horic. The word for I is in Hebrew it's iron and in Arabic gets, I mean I would love to be able to say that the English word I is related to those but it's not another one.

Speaker 1:          15:04          In Amharic there's theirs which means house. In Hebrew it's bite, but when it's used in a compound word with another noun, it's pronounced the bait like in Batesville, the word force school in Arabic it's bait or bite, but the amount of vocabulary that M Horak has in common with Hebrew and Arabic might be less than you'd expect. That's partly because a lot of the vocabulary is of Ku shidduch origin as much as 30% and other vocabulary is unique to empiric or to Ethio. Semitic. Amharic is a very interesting language and it's a language with clearly semitic features including the verbal system and the root system using continental roots and inserting them into templates. Those are things I'm familiar with from other Semitic languages like Hebrew and Arabic and then include some of the vocabulary we just looked at a second ago, but some elements are quite different from other Semitic languages such as its Sov word order.

Speaker 1:          15:57          Amharic is a language that I would love to dig into more in the future. At some point in my last video on Japanese, I forgot to ask a question of the day. So today I'm not going to forget. Here is the question of the day for speakers of M Horak. How widely is amharic spoken in your area and your community and if you're an immigrant from Ethiopia living somewhere else in the world, what language do members of your community normally speak with each other and for speakers of other Semitic languages? Have you noticed the similarities between m horic and your language? What sorts of similarities have you noticed? Be sure to follow Lang, focus on facebook, twitter, and instagram. And once again I want to say thank you to all of my patrion supporters, especially these wonderful people right here on the screen for their monthly pledges. Thank you for watching and have a nice day.

Speaker 2:          16:46          Yeah.
