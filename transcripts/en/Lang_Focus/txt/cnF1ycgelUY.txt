Speaker 1:          00:00          Follow lane focus on facebook, twitter, and instagram. Hello everyone. Welcome to the Lange Focus Channel and my name is Paul. Today's video is a quick video to explain a concept that I often talk about in my videos, but the viewer sometimes don't understand and they ask me about in the comments. The concept is grammatical case case refers to the grammatical function of a noun or a pronoun in the sentence. For example, if these are all the words in a sentence, eight lion honeybadger. Ah, there are two possible messages. This one, the lion ate the honeybadger or this one, the honey badger eight the lion. There are two roles in the sentence. The animal doing the eating and the animal being eaten in English. We normally know which role announced as fulfilling based on word order. The subject of the sentence comes here and the object of a sentence comes here.

Speaker 1:          00:50          Prepositions can also tell us announce function. For example, the honey badger gave a warning to the snake. The preposition to tells us the snake is the indirect object receiving the action. But in many languages, word order and prepositions are not the main ways to show the function of it. Now, the form of the now might change or a special ending might be added to the word to show what's function in the sentence. In English, we do this to show possession like in the phrase the Lions defeat the apostrophe s shows that the defeat belongs to the lion and in English we also have pronouns that changed for form to show grammatical case. For example, I robbed her, she robbed me, I and she or the subject forms while me and her are the object forms, but there are languages that show grammatical case much more than English does.

Speaker 1:          01:35          The most common grammatical cases are probably nominative, accusative and genitive. Nominative case generally indicates the subject of a sentence which often means the person or thing doing the action like this and Arabic acolyte walla due to fatten meaning the boy ate an apple. Here. We can see that the word for boy [inaudible] has an e at the end because it is the subject of the sentence and nominative case can also indicate the thing that the subject is equivalent to. So in this sentence who are telling me soon hear the word for student. Tilimeers has wound at the end to indicate nominative case because it is equal to the subject. This ending has the extra n sound at the end because it's indefinite. These kinds of changes to the form of a word to show grammatical difference are called inflections. Accusative case generally indicates that direct object of a verb in Arabic, it has that use along with some other uses.

Speaker 1:          02:27          For example, [inaudible] which means I drink milk here, the word for milk Halib has an ah at the end to indicate that it's the direct object or the accusative case. Genitive case generally indicates that one noun is being modified by another one often to show possession. We dotty [inaudible] meaning the boys teacher here. The word for boy wallet has an e sound at the end to show possession. Those are probably the three cases you're most likely to run into, but depending on the language, there are numerous other cases. Well, the date of case is generally used for a noun which receives something. Something moves towards that. Now [inaudible] I didn't give the girl money here. The Latin word for girl who in La has an e at the end to indicate that she is the indirect object on the receiving end of an action. Locative case is used to indicate a location.

Speaker 1:          03:21          Here's an example from Turkish Fda Beer Kita aqua doom, which means I read a book at home, hear the word for HouseF has dead at the end to show that it's the location where the reading took place. In English, we use a separate preposition like at [inaudible] or on to show location rather than a case inflection. Instrumental case is used for announced that is used as a tool or a means of completing an action. Here's an example from Polish p shapew with them, which means I write with a pen, the word for pen people. It all ends with the final, Oh, which has replaced by e m because it's the instrument being used to carry out the action of writing. Notice that because of that ending, there was no need to add a standalone preposition, meaning with those are some of the most common cases. The main thing to keep in mind is that the form of the now or of the Pronoun changes depending on its function in the sentence.

Speaker 1:          04:12          Sometimes cases apply not only to announce, but also to words that are connected to them like adjectives and articles. Here's an example of an adjective being inflicted for case. This time again in Arabic, I'll have been to Al Jameela too, which means the beautiful girl here, the Noun for girl didn't has the nominative case ending and so does the adjective Jameela, but the Arabic equivalent of h at the end of the word changes to a t sound before the case nd. And here's an example of articles taking case inflection. This time from old English, say Kooning, the king. In nominative case, in the genitive case, it's fast schooning gis salt. The Noun is inflected with the genitive ending. And the definite article also has a special form in the genitive case, words have particular functions in all languages of course, but only in certain languages do they commonly indicate these functions with changes to the form of the work when talking about languages that do.

Speaker 1:          05:06          So we often talk about now in cases or case endings, but remember that not only nouns can be inflicted for case, but also pronouns, which represent nouns and also adjectives which modify, announce and articles which show whether nouns or definite or indefinite. I hope that was a helpful summary for anyone who needed clarification. So the quick question of the day, do words in your language change form depending on their function in the sentence. If you can think of an example, let us know in the comments down below. Be sure to follow Lang, focus on facebook, twitter, and instagram. And once again, thanks to all of my patrion supporters, especially these extra special ones right here for their monthly pledges. Thank you for watching and have a nice day. Oh right.
