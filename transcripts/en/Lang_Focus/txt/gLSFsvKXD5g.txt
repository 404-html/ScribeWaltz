Speaker 1:          00:02          [inaudible] been definitely towards canal.

Speaker 1:          00:12          Good evening folks. Today I want to talk about uh, studying Japanese and the most useful materials for learning Japanese. Obviously I haven't used all the different materials in the world for studying Japanese, but I have to do some and that's familiar with others to some extent. So I'll tell you about what I think and my experience. One of the good things about studying Japanese is that there is such a wide range of good materials. Uh, there's just, there's a lot out there to choose from. So you can go to the bookstore and look through a bunch of books and see which ones appeal to you. Uh, it comes down to learning style and taste to some extent, but I'll just get into it. Uh, the first series that I used was called Japanese for busy people. So there are, uh, well the title was always kind of funny.

Speaker 1:          00:56          I don't know why it's for busy people. Why not for business people? The content of this series is basically for business. It's for simple business situations where like do you go on a business trip to Tokyo when you talked to like a, what was it, uh, Mr Tanaka from Tokyo Electric and that kind of thing. So the situations are kind of business. I found that aspect of it a little boring because I was never working in business in Japan. I came here as a teacher, um, so that it might not be relevant for you in terms of content and completely, but it's a good series and if you go through volumes one, two and maybe three, you'll learn quite a bit. Uh, it's quite well laid out. Uh, it has like a short conversation in each chapter. Then it introduces the vocabulary and some grammar from, uh, from that conversation and gives you some exercises to practice it.

Speaker 1:          01:46          And it's quite, quite good, useful, standard Japanese. And I think it's a good series. Um, there's another popular series called, uh, it's called [inaudible] or a Japanese for every one. And that one is quite good as well. I haven't used the whole thing, but I've looked through it and it looks quite good. And a lot of people swear by it. So that's another one to think about is, I mean Danone Hong Kong or Japanese for everyone as it's called. Another series I used was one that's only published in Vancouver. It's published at a Japanese language school in Vancouver, I think it's called Nakagawa language center and it's called gum bucket. That's the name of the series. And that one was really good. It was really fun. It was really motivating. I really liked that. The best as a like a pure beginners textbook or five volumes, five volumes.

Speaker 1:          02:36          Um, number one is really simple, but it goes up to five and if you finish up to volume five, that prepares you for the first level of the Japanese proficiency test. Uh, but all the conversations and the characters and stuff were quite cute and I'm quite motivating. They got me interested in learning Japanese more. Let me just double check the name of that center. No, not knock a Gullah, sorry to Nina Ogawa Japanese language. So it's hard to get those books. I don't know if you can find the [inaudible] gum but day series, but if you can find it online, I think you can order it through the website of new gala.com. So have a look if you can get it. It's good for beginners, at least the lower levels. So those were the beginning textbooks at an intermediate level. I loved this book, this one and integrated approach to intermediate Japanese by a Kiddo Muda.

Speaker 1:          03:25          And now when we Hanukkah mcgloin, this one was awesome. This made me really love studying Japanese. Uh, the way it was laid out. The conversations were fun and interesting. The stories and texts were interesting and it wasn't focused on business. It was focused on college life. And I wasn't a student, but I had been a student so I could relate to college life a little bit better than corporate life. So the vocab and the topics and just the whole theme of this book was more interesting to me. Some people don't seem to like it. I've read some of the reviews on Amazon and some people say they find it hard to follow. Um, it might depend on your learning style. Like I'm a very inductive learner. I like to look at texts and conversations and kind of figure out what's going on and look at the pieces.

Speaker 1:          04:09          And God, this piece must be the verb. This must be the whatever. I like to figure things out. Um, and that works well with this book because it's the beginning of each chapter and it will have like, uh, like two or three different conversations or texts. So if we look at this one, it's got one conversation, then it's got another one, then it's got another one, and then after that it's got a text. And then after that it has the vocabulary. And after the vocabulary, then it has, uh, that's the congee. Then after that it has the grammar points and then it has a grammar exercises. So the, the texts and the conversations are separate from all of the breakdown and the explanation and the exercises. Those come after the texts. So for me, that's fine. I like to look at the text and the conversations and then flip back to the explanations when I need it.

Speaker 1:          04:59          And then I can figure out the other things on my own to whatever extent I can. Then I can just flip back if I need an explanation. Some people like to have the explanation right up front in their face from the beginning. They're more deductive learners. Uh, they like to have it explained to them before they read the text or at the same time. So if you are like that, you might not like this book that much, but have a look at it. I really liked it and this was my favorite book ever. So another one at the intermediate level was this one, which I didn't like. I didn't have as much fun with it, but it was useful. It taught me a lot. It's this one, uh, [inaudible], uh, that means Japanese from the intermediate level. That's the name, that's the meaning of this title.

Speaker 1:          05:42          But this one is completely in Japanese. This other one and integrated approach. The one I showed you before, this has a lot of English in it and has translations and explanations. This one is all in Japanese. So this one is a bit more, uh, intense of an experience because you have to dive right in. It's all Japanese, no explanations. It doesn't even have a title in English. When I looked this up on Amazon to check if it's available, uh, I had, uh, I had to type in the espn number because when I typed in the Japanese, it didn't show up because it was amazon.com in America. But, uh, if I looked up the espn, then this name, this title appeared in Roman characters in Amazon. So it doesn't even have an English name. You would have to look up. Uh, maybe I'll put the ISB and on the screen so you can look it up if you want.

Speaker 1:          06:29          Um, but this one's good. It's, it has great texts. The texts are interesting stories and um, and uh, there's a lot of stories and there's, there are some explanations of proverbs and different expressions in Japanese. Uh, I found it really useful to just go through the stories and highlight vocabulary I didn't know, and then look at the vocabulary lists and the grammar exercises after, after the stories. I found it a bit hard to do all of the exercises without a classroom teacher. I did this on my own at home. I've actually never taken the Japanese lesson in my life and I did it all through self study. Um, I found it a bit hard to do this all at home self study style, but I got through it and it was a bit of hard work, but I learned a lot from it. So this one is good.

Speaker 1:          07:19          It's good material. Just if you have a teacher it will be easier for you cause they can help you out with, um, with the exercises when the explanation in Japanese is not quite clear. All right, so that was intermediate level. At a more advanced level. I used this one, a Gq collagio cue and on your own goals. So that's Japanese from the intermediate level to the advanced level. That's what that title means. Um, or as they say, progressing from intermediate to advanced, that's uh, that's the way they translated it. So this one was pretty good. Um, it was kind of a bridge between intermediate to advanced. I got about halfway through this book and it was good. It was useful. I learned a lot from it. Uh, but I started using authentic materials. Instead I started just using newspapers and, and texts from magazines and just trying to work through those and learn vocabulary.

Speaker 1:          08:09          But this is good. It's similar to the, to the integrated approach to intermediate Japanese won't like, it has texts that are interesting and then it breaks it down with the vocab and the grammar exercises afterwards. Um, I found it quite similar in format and just interesting to use, but at that level I just thought it's better to get into the authentic materials. Okay. So those are the ones that I have used and I think are pretty good and I recommend, I've used some others here and there. Uh, and I use some different ones for Congee, which I'll probably talk about in a different video cause Kanji is a different beast entirely and deserves its own attention. But I recommend all those, especially this one, which was my favorite integrated approach to intermediate Japanese. But if you're a beginner, then you could get me not only Hong Kong or you could get Japanese for busy people and work through it.

Speaker 1:          09:01          One more note on Japanese for busy people get the Kona version. Don't get the romanized version. There are to the romanized means it's written in. Well, it has Roman characters in it and I think it has the Japanese as well. But, um, I don't recommend using the romanized version because you might use the Roman letters as a crutch. It's good to get used to the corner letters right away from the beginning. Just dive right in. You can learn them very quickly if you dive in and make yourself do it. So make yourself do it. All right. I hope that's helpful. Have a nice night guys. See Ya.

Speaker 2:          09:38          Okay.
