Speaker 1:          00:00          Hello everyone. Welcome to the Lange Focus Channel and my name is Paul. What should I talk about today? Maybe I should talk about a language spoken by tens of millions of people. Maybe I should talk about one of the world's major language families or a country with stunning linguistic diversity. No, I think today I'll talk about something a little different. Today's topic is Toky Pona Toki Pona. What's that? Toki poner is a constructed language, meaning that it did not arise naturally, but it was created by someone in order to fulfill certain criteria or a certain vision. The most well known constructed language might be Esperanto, which I made a video about a couple of years ago. Toki Pono is another constructed language that I thought was unique and interesting enough to make a video about. It's not spoken by very many people, but it's well known amongst fans of constructed languages. The name Toki Pono means the language of good and as a minimalist language. The idea behind it is extreme simplicity, especially in its core vocabulary. The purpose of Toki Pona is not just to simplify communication, but to simplify your own thinking. To force yourself to eliminate unnecessary information and ideas and focus on what's really important. Toki Pona has a core vocabulary of only 123 words. Yes, you heard that, right? 123 words. You can learn those hundred and 23 words in just a couple of hours using an app like memorize or unlucky. I should point out that.
