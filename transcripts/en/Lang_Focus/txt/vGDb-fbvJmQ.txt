Speaker 1:          00:04          Hello everyone. Welcome to the Lange Focus Channel and my name is Paul and despite what half the people in the comments say, English is my native language, why doesn't he show his birth certificate and you know what? I wish he would. He should show his birth certificate. The other thing, why doesn't he show his birth certificate? Today's topic is 10 common mistakes that native English speakers make. When most of us study a foreign language, we try to avoid mistakes and speak accurately. Some of us are even scared to make mistakes, but you know what? Even native speakers make mistakes and that includes speakers of my native language. English. When I say mistakes, I'm not talking about dialectal variation. English has various dialects that differ from the standard language, and I'm not talking about those differences. I'm talking about native speakers of dialects that are very close to standard English, but who make mistakes?

Speaker 1:          00:50          What kind of mistakes? Well, here are 10 of them. Number 10, unclear subject number. For example, every one of those people need to buy a ticket. The correct sentence would be every one of those people needs to buy a ticket because the plural word people is right next to the verb. Some people might mistake it for the subject, but the subject of the sentence is actually every one of the people is extra information about that subject. Everyone is singular. Number nine, confusing homophones. When writing homophones are words that sound the same as other words that have a different meaning and usually have a different spelling. One common example is the confusion of effect and effect. This confusion arises because the first vowel of each word is often reduced and sounds like a Schwab and this makes them sound like when someone's writing the word, they may be hearing the sound of the word in their head and they might choose the wrong spelling to go with that sound.

Speaker 1:          01:39          Another example of this is they're there and they're there and they're sound the same, but they are. Sounds a little different, but in its reduced form basically sounds the same, but people often choose the wrong one. When writing. Another example is the confusion of your, the possessive Pronoun with your. The contraction of you are. Another example is writing of instead of Apostrophe v, the contracted form of, for example, someone might write, I would have gone to the party if I'd had time, but it should be would've with Apostrophe v. They sound the same and casual pronunciation, so that's why they get confused. Number eight, confusion of adjectives and adverbs. For example, he's saying really good, good as an adjective, but we need an adverb to modify the verb sang so the correct sentences. He sang really well. This mistake is the mistake that kids often make before they've had English grammar drilled into them and it's also the kind of mistake that less educated people might make.

Speaker 1:          02:29          Even educated people might make this mistake, but they'd probably notice it right away and maybe correct themselves. Another related cases that people sometimes use an adverb when they actually need an adjective. So take this case for example. I feel very badly about that. The sentence is wrong. It should be. I feel very bad about that, but why is it wrong? I thought adverbs modify verb, well, adverbs, modify action verbs, but feel is a state of verb. It just describes the way something is. The state that it's in. It doesn't describe an actual state of verbs are followed by adjectives, not advert. Inevitably, someone will ask, what about the sentence? I feel. Well, isn't that correct? Yes, that's a correct sentence, but well is not an adverb in that sentence. It's actually an adjective meaning healthy. It's not the adverb equivalent of the adjective. Good. Number seven, double negatives.

Speaker 1:          03:14          Most educated adults won't make this mistake and if they do, it's probably kind of an intentional casual style of speaking. You know, trying to sound all bad ass. A double negative is like this. I don't have no money, man. The correct sentence would be I don't have any money, man. Another example I didn't talk to nobody correct sentence would be I didn't talk to anybody so that one could be a mistake or it could be people intentionally trying to copy the features of a dialect that's cool and popular. Number six, not using the subjunctive mood. Subjunctive mood as a form of the verb. That's used for something not factual like possibility or desire or a necessity in English. The subjunctive has a unique form in the third person present tense and the verb to be has a unique forum in the third person past tense.

Speaker 1:          03:54          Some people just don't use it at all or they're confused about when to use it. For example, it's important that he goes to the hospital that's actually wrong. The correct sentence would be, it's important that he go to the hospital. We need the subjunctive mood here to show necessity. Another example, if I was rich, the correct version would be if I were rich here, we need the subjunctive because it's showing possibility. Number five, confusion of is and our this confusion usually happens with there is and there are or here is and here are. For example, here's three cookies for you. The correct sentence would be, here are three cookies for you. Another example, there's around seven people at the party. The correct sentence would be there are around seven people at the party, but so many people, even educated speakers use both of these forms so much that I'm not even sure that they're considered mistakes anymore.

Speaker 1:          04:39          Number for confusion, that the verbs lie and lay. Most native English speakers know that there's a difference between these words, but they're kind of confused about what the difference is or they know what the difference is, but they use them indirectly anyway. Lie as an intransitive verb, meaning it takes no direct object. For example, let's lie on the bed. Oh boy. I can imagine the comments already lay as a transitive verb, meaning it takes a direct object. For example, let's lay the laundry on the bed, but lots of people say, let's lay on the bed and that's wrong. People also mistake the past tense form and the past participle of life. I often hear people say live like he lied on the floor or laid like he laid on the floor, but really the past tense of lie is lay. In the past. Participle is glade.

Speaker 1:          05:22          The past tense of les is late in the past participle. There's also laid number three, confusion of the words, fewer and less, fewer as used for countdowns and less is used for non count mountains, but people often use less for nouns. For example, I eat less cookies than I used to. Cookies are accountable, so the correct sentence is I eat fewer cookies. Then I used to. That kind of mistake is very widespread number too confusing. The past tense form and the past participle form of irregular verbs. For example, the group to go has the past tense form went in the past participle gone, but lots of people say things like, I should have went to the party, but the correct sentence is I should've gone to the party. Another example, the verb to drink the past tense form is drank in the past. Participle is drunk.

Speaker 1:          06:03          Some people say things like, he's already drank two beers and it's only 4:00 PM, but it should be. He's already drunk. Two Beers, number one, misuse of the word. Literally. The real original meaning of this word is that something in reality is exactly as spoken without metaphor or exaggeration. For example, if you say she literally has thousands of pairs of shoes, that means if you count all of her pairs of shoes, there will be thousands of them. Not Hundreds, not dozens, but really thousands, but these days people often use the word literally just to put emphasis on something that's not actually literally, for example, that guy has literally a monster. Oh, really? That sentence means that he looks like this. He's not a human. He's a real monster, but that's not what they meant. They just meant that he's a bad person. This kind of mistake literally makes me scream, what are you waiting for me to scream?

Speaker 1:          06:50          I don't actually scream. I didn't mean that. Literally. I think that basically all native speakers make some mistakes in writing and in speaking, if we judge by strict grammatical standards, sometimes it's because they're just thinking on their feet and maybe their ideas aren't completely organized, so things come out a little bit unclear and sometimes it might be a habitual mistake. They repeat the same mistake over and over, but the issue is not black and white. Obviously standard languages need rules so that there's not total chaos, but at the same time languages are always evolving and sometimes a mistake may be a new innovation in the language that just doesn't match the rules of grammar yet because the rules of grammar would decided in the past. So the question of the day for native English speakers, what do you think of the kind of mistakes that I described in the video?

Speaker 1:          07:31          Do you think that they're a danger to the English language or do you see them as mere innovations or does it depend on the case and the question of the day for native speakers of other languages, do you notice these kinds of mistakes in your own native language? What do you think of them? Leave your comments down below.
