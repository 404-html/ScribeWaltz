Speaker 1:          00:00          Hello everyone. Welcome to the Lange Focus Channel and my name is Paul. Today we'll be answering the question, how are British English and American English different? One of the most commonly asked questions by learners of English and hopefully native speakers of English. We'll learn a thing or two from this video as well. The truth is that both British English and American English have numerous varieties, in other words, various accents and dialects. So for the main part of this video I'll try to focus on the most standard non regional variety of each one. Disclaimer, I'm not American, I'm actually Canadian, but I'm confident that we will someday be Americans after the invasion standard. Canadian English is very, very close to general American English, so I will say the American English samples myself, unless there's some specific need to distinguish between American and Canadian pronunciation. There are several ways in which British English and American English are different vocabulary, accent, spelling, and the grammar vocabulary.

Speaker 1:          00:58          Let me just throw a bunch of examples at you. In the U s people generally say garbage or trash. While in the UK they generally say rubbish. Both literally and figuratively. The game was rubbish. Americans go on vacation while Brits go on holiday and that's also possible in American English. In the u s people rent apartments while in the UK they rent flats in the u s if your apartment is that street level, then you live on the first floor and the person above you. It lives on the second floor. In the UK, you live on the ground floor and the person above you lives on the first floor. If that person above you is unable or just too lazy to take the stairs in the u s they'd take the elevator in the UK, they'd take the lift. When you're bored at home in the U s you might turn on the TV while in the UK you would turn on the telly.

Speaker 1:          01:51          When you step outside of your building to go for a walk in the u s you might walk on the sidewalk while in the UK you walk on the pavement and if you're tired of walking in the u s you might take the subway. In the UK, you take the underground in the U S it's perfectly okay to wear pants when you're riding the subway. But in the UK you'd better where some trousers too, because pants means underpants. And specifically women's underpants are sometimes referred to as knickers in the UK. So when someone overreacts to something in the u s you might say, don't get your panties in a bunch. But in the UK you would say, don't get your knickers in a twist.

Speaker 2:          02:31          Paul, how dare you be so crude? I can't show this video to my six year old students.

Speaker 1:          02:35          Oh, don't even worry about that. They'll just watch it on their phones during recess. Going back to the word pants for a moment, it can also be used in British English as an adjective, meaning something is crappy or it sucks. For example, that's how album his pants in American English, you might say, that album sucks. Excellent. So for the U S I'll try to focus on general American English and for the, I'll try to focus on received pronunciation. These are the accents you're likely to hear on CNN and the BBC respectively are sounds American English is roddick, meaning that our sounds are always clearly pronounced British English is non Roddick meaning that the r sound is not pronounced unless it's followed by a vowel sound. Listen to the difference. My father's in the car, my father's in the car. Let's focus on two words. Father, father, car, car.

Speaker 1:          03:29          Notice that the final r sound is not pronounced in British English. Father ends in a simple Schwab vowel like father and in car. The vowel sound is linkedin in place of the r sound car. Now the thing about British non Roddick accents that I find pretty wild is something called the intrusive are. That means that people sometimes add an r sound to a word that doesn't actually have one. If it's followed by a vowel in the next word. For example, in the sentence I saw a film in British English. It's sometimes sounds like this. I saw a film, so you can hear that there's an r sound connecting saw, and I once had a British on the job trainer and I remember she said, hello, my name is Paula and I will be your trainer today. I remember thinking polar, what? You can't say your own name, but it wasn't just her.

Speaker 1:          04:16          That was the intrusive are t sounds in British English. And again, I must emphasize that I'm talking about the accent referred to as received. Pronunciation. T sounds are pronounced as hard teas, in other words, voiceless to sounds in the u s they sometimes sound like an alveolar tap instead of to an Alveolar stop. This normally occurs in an unstressed syllable between two vowel sounds or between a vowel and a roddick sound like an Rsl. So in the u s people say butter in the UK, they say butter in the u s stop fighting in the UK. Stop fighting. You may have also noticed that the ow sound in the word stop was a little different, which brings me to, oh, sounds in the word stop. The American oh sound is an unrounded vowel. Ah, while the British oh sound is rounded or another example, hot, hot.

Speaker 1:          05:11          There's also the o Diphthong in the word? No, in the UK, no, in the UK the sound is a Schwab followed by an as input show show a sounds in other words, sounds represented by the letter a are in UK. English normally becomes an ass out in American English for example, in the UK Hoff and in the u s half words without in British English remain pretty similar in American English in the UK cat end to the u s cat. An exception is a small set of words in which the AE is followed by a double are in which case the vowel is pronounced as air in the u s in the UK, Mary in the U s Mary. Because of the difference in the u s Mary and Mary sound the same. Carrie and Carrie sound the same spelling. American and British spellings are largely the same, but there are a few notable differences.

Speaker 1:          06:12          This is in large part because Noah Webster, whom the webster dictionary is named after, made an effort to reform English spelling in the 17 hundreds in order to make the word spelled the way they sounded. This resulted in some spelling changes in American English most but not all words that ended Ari in the UK and in Er in the u s for example, center theater, meter somber. Some words that end in nce in the UK are spelled with an se in the u s license defense offense. Some words with ou in the UK are spelled with oh in the u s color, favor, honor, labor, et cetera. The ending I s e became izze in the u s organize, apologize. A similar change also occurs in other contexts where the s is voiced. In other words, it makes a sound analyze cozy. There are verbs ending with El that take a double l in British English.

Speaker 1:          07:13          When a suffix is added in American English, there's no double l traveled, canceled, marvelous. If you're wondering how the last one fits in with the others. Remember that marvel is a verb and then an adjectival suffix is added to it. Grammar. There were only very minor grammatical differences between British English and American English auxiliary verbs. British people use Shell for the future much more than Americans as well as to ask for advice or an opinion. Some difference in preposition use in the u s people say on the weekend, but in the UK they say after the weekend and then the u s people say different from or different them, but in the UK they say different from or difference too. There are some different past tense forms. For example, in American English, the past tense of the word learn is learned. While in British English it's more common to say learnt.

Speaker 1:          08:06          Actually both forms are used in either country, but there is more of a tendency towards one form. This is true for other words like dreamed versus drempt burned versus burnt leaned versus linked, et cetera. Another example in the u s the past tense of dive is usually dove. In the UK, it's dived. Maybe the American form developed by analogy with drive and drove. Anyways, differences like these are not consistent, but you'll notice some different paths, tense forms here in their past participles sometimes past participles half a different form. The most well known example is for the verb get in the u s there's get got gotten but in the UK it's get got got both forms got and gotten have existed since the middle English period, but Godson has fallen out of use in the UK. Got It. Can Be used in American English in the form have got but with the meaning of have not have received or have become.

Speaker 1:          09:04          I haven't gotten the eviction notice yet. I haven't got the eviction notice yet. All right, let's check a couple more sentences and see what we encounter in the u s I think we need a lawyer in the UK. I reckon we needed a solicitor. You'll notice that a couple of words here are different. British people often use the word [inaudible], which means think or suppose Americans know this word, but rarely use it, and while Americans would typically refer to a professional legal consultant as a lawyer in the UK, they often say solicitor, which is a type of lawyer that does consultation. The type of lawyer who represents you in court in the UK is usually a barrister. While in the U s they're usually referred to as attorneys. Another sentence in the U s I'm going for a beer with my friends in the UK. I'm going for a pint with my mates.

Speaker 1:          09:53          Notice that British people often say pint where Americans would say beer. Brits also say beer as a countable. Now unlike this, but pint is frequently used and notice that Britt's often say mate, where Americans would say, friend, the differences between British English and American English might seem surprising or a music, but remember in this video I'm zooming in on the differences and focusing on them. For the most part, they're actually the same. There are some minor differences in vocabulary and pronunciation and grammar and spelling, but any native speaker with a little bit of exposure to the other look quickly adapt to these differences and be able to understand the other variety without any problem. The differences are sometimes greater if we focus on regional dialects and socio elects of British English and American English. While most Americans probably have no trouble understanding received pronunciation, they may have some trouble understanding cockney English or the Jordy accent of northeastern England or other varieties.

Speaker 1:          10:48          But as far as standard non regional speech goes, I'd say that the differences are minimal. However, learners of English who focus on one of the two varieties will likely have a little bit of trouble understanding the other until they gained significant exposure to it. The question of the day, what other differences between American and British English are you aware of in this video? I was only able to give a limited number of examples, so add yours in the comments. Be sure to follow Lang, focus on facebook, twitter, and instagram.
