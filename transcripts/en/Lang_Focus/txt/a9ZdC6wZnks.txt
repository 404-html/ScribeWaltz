Speaker 1:          00:00          Hello everyone. Welcome to the Lange focus channel. This is just a quick mini video to answer a frequently asked question that I get on my channel and that is what is a Lingua Franca. Lingua Franca is a phrase that I use a lot on the channel. A Lingua Franca is a language that is used for communication between people who speak different native languages. Here are a couple of examples, situations of when a Lingua Franca is necessary. For example, there are many languages spoken in a particular area or amongst different ethnic groups and they need the language to communicate with one another. Another example, there is trade between two different countries that have no common language.

Speaker 1:          00:36          Example, three at a professional conference for experts from different countries who have different native languages on a global scale. The current largest Lingua Franca is English, but there are other various Lingua Franca is on a regional level and on a national level. An example of a regional Lingua Franca is the French language. In Africa, there are a lot of different languages spoken in Africa and in a large portion of the continent they use French as their language of communication as their Lingua Franca. An example of a national Lingua Franca is in Pakistan where there are various different languages spoken, but or Redo the national language is used as the Lingua Franca between those different groups. And other similar situation is in Philippines where they have to Lingua Franca us kind of what they mixed the two Lingua Franca. Sometimes they have to gallog and English and those are used as the Lingua Franca between people from different regions of the country.

Speaker 1:          01:28          Sometimes there are both National Lingua Franca is and more local Lingua Franca is within a country. So if we take the example of Philippines, there is a region where Ilocano is the main language. So someone from the Ilocanos speaking region meet someone from, for example, the BCO speaking region. They'll probably use the national Lingua Franca, which is tagalog or English or use both of them. Uh, but if that same person meets someone from the Ilocanos speaking region who speaks a different language, like a minority language, then they'll probably use that local language Ilocano as the Lingua Franca because just in that one region there are various languages spoken. So the Lingua Franca you use depends on who you're speaking to. So you're sort of leveling up. If you speak to someone in your region, you can't understand them. Use that regional Lingua Franca. If you speak to someone from a different region used the national Lingua Franca. So it sounds all kind of complicated, but basically it means speak the language that helps you communicate with that person the best.

Speaker 2:          02:28          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          02:28          The term Lingua Franca itself comes from the name of a language that was spoken in this way in the Mediterranean region for hundreds of years. It was kind of a creole romance language that had a lot of vocabulary from different Mediterranean languages mixed into it. One English source from 1632 referred to this language as bastard Spanish. So to wrap up and clarify, a Lingua Franca is a language that is used for communication between the speakers of different native languages. I hope that clarifies things. Thank you for watching. Have a nice day.
