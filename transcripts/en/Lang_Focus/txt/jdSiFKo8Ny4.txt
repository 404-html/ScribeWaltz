Speaker 1:          00:01          According to my research, there are 26 countries in Latin America. So the most widely spoken language in the world is obviously Latin.

Speaker 2:          00:11          Right.

Speaker 1:          00:22          Good evening everyone. Today I'm going to talk about what are the most commonly spoken languages in the world. A lot of people want to know that. What are the most commonly spoken or most widely spoken languages on earth? Well, it depends on how you measure it. It depends on whether you measure only native speakers or if you measure the uh, the number of second language, third language speakers, all that. Uh, so let's just talk about a couple of different ways to count the number of speakers. So the first way is just by native speakers. If we do that, then mandarin is the most widely spoken language in the world with 1.1 billion speakers, that's billion with a b. And that's only Mandarin. That doesn't include all of the other Chinese languages in China. Uh, if you include those, that would be another couple hundred million. But just native speakers of Mandarin 1.1 billion.

Speaker 1:          01:15          You mentioned that billion after that. Number two is English, which is far, far behind with 330 million native speakers. Uh, as you might expect, it's in the top couple, but it's only number two after, after Mandarin Chinese number three is Spanish with 300 million people. So what's not far behind English? Judging by the number of native speakers, it's not far behind English, but we'll get to that again later. And number four is Hindi slash or do, uh, that's widely considered to be the same language. It's Hindi in India, but it's Urdu in Pakistan or when spoken, um, in, uh, by Muslims. And you've written in the Arabic script, but it's usually considered the same language because the core is the same and they are mutually intelligible. So same language, basically. Number five is Arabic with 200 million people. A Bengali with 185 million people is number six. Bengali is up, the language spoken in Bangladesh and that area of the eastern part of Indian sub continent and number seven is Portuguese with 160 million people.

Speaker 1:          02:26          Number eight is Russian with 160 million. About the same as Portuguese and Japanese. 122 million, puts it at number nine, and then German is number 10 with a 100 million. Then we have Punjabi Javanese that's spoken in Indonesia, and then French is number 13. Umm, so let's compare that to the number of speakers including second language speakers, but proficient second language speakers proficient meaning that they can speak it fairly well. Uh, even though it's not their native language. So number one is still mandarin Chinese with 1.3 5 billion. So basically the speakers of all the other Chinese languages also learn mandarin as the national language of China. That's why there's an extra 200 or two, 250 million speakers of Mandarin Chinese when we include the second language speakers. Now English is surprising one, well not surprising, but impressive with that. It's still at number two with 1.2 billion speakers, including the second language speakers.

Speaker 1:          03:30          So that's quite a difference between the number of native speakers. 330000001.2 billion. So that's something like 870 million people have learned English as a second language and speak it proficiently. That's quite impressive. That's a large percentage of the world's population. Uh, when we get to number three, there's a change. It's not Spanish, it's Hindi and Urdu because in India and in Pakistan, those languages are not the native language of everybody. But a lot of people who speak a different language learn Hindi and Urdu as a second language. Uh, so they can communicate with speakers of other languages in the Indian subcontinent. So that has a 750 million proficient speakers if we're including second language speakers. So that displaced Spanish from number three, but no Spanish is still at number four with 530 million speakers including second language speakers than Arabic. Still at number five with 300 and million, 319 million speakers.

Speaker 1:          04:33          And that's because a lot of people in Africa learn Arabic as a second language. Uh, number six is French with 274 million. So French is another one that jumped way up the list when we included second language speakers. That's because there are a lot of countries in the world where French is not the native language, but it's the official language or it's a language that is spoken by a large, a large proportion of the population, so that includes much of Africa. A French is widely spoken in Africa and a lot of different countries, so that's why it goes up from 75 million to 274 million. It's almost 200 million people speak French proficiently as a second language, so that's quite impressive to number seven we get a language that wasn't even on the list for when we calculate it, just native speakers and that is molay. Slash. Indonesian. That's another one of those languages that has two different names because people in different cultural groups or different countries call it something different.

Speaker 1:          05:34          So Malaya Malaya has Malaysian language in Malaysia and it's Indonesian language in Indonesia, but same language, almost entirely the same. Just some different vocabulary and different accent and that kind of thing. That one goes up to 270 million if we include second language speakers. And that's because in Indonesia it's, it's not the native language of very many people. I think it's five to 10% of the people who speak it as their native language. But it is the national language and everybody learns it as the Lingua Franca and as a language of education that of business and everything. So it doesn't have that many native speakers, but it has a huge number of speak proficient speakers, including second language speakers. So Indonesian and Malay with 270 million people. And then after that, um, I didn't keep track of all of them. But it's interesting how the most important languages are not necessarily the ones with the most native speakers because languages can be important based on their status as a Lingua Franca.

Speaker 1:          06:38          So we see that with melee and Indonesian. So just because a language has a lot of speakers doesn't necessarily mean that it's the most important or most influential language on a global scale. So another factor that we can think about introduced into the conversation is how many places that language is spoken in over how wide of a geographic area is it spoken? So if you think about Chinese, it's spoken basically only in China. If we're thinking of Mandarin, it's spoken in China, it's also spoken in Taiwan, although they claimed Taiwan as part of China. Um, and it's also spoken in the Chinese diaspora to a large extent, but basically it's only in China, just that one country. It's a big country. It's an important country, but it's only that one country. So does that make Chinese the most important language? Is Mandarin the most important language?

Speaker 1:          07:29          Just because it's spoken by the most people? Well, I would say no because on a global scale it's not used that much by a non native speakers. And it's not used between people of different countries as a Lingua Franca, it's not used as an international language of business. So I would say it's not the number one most influential or important language. Even though China has any emerging country and it's a powerful country, an important country, it's still not the most important language in the world. I would say it. English you could argue is the most important because it has such a huge number of second language speakers but it's, but they're dispersed all over the world. So everywhere you can find people who speak English. So it's arguably the most important. Um, Spanish is also a very important one because Spanish is spoken in so many countries, uh, and it has native speakers in so many countries.

Speaker 1:          08:19          So Spanish could be, uh, one of the top most influential languages, Arabic as well as spoken in a lot of different countries. Arabic is a tricky one though because it has a huge number of dialects and the dialects can vary quite a bit. So whether you can communicate with speakers in a different country or not, if you learn Arabic, that's an entirely different issue in that complicates the matters with Arabic. So I would say Arabic is not one of the most important though. It's, it's up there. It's quite important and quite useful around the world, especially in Africa and the Middle East. French is globally important because of that, because of all the places it's spoken. It's spoken in a lot of former colonies in Asia and the Caribbean and South America a little bit. Um, and especially in Africa and in many countries. In Europe, French is spoken, so French is also one of the most important languages because of its dispersion over a large area. I would say English, Spanish, French, maybe Arabic would be the most important on a global scale if we're thinking about the number of countries and the widest geographic area. All right. Those are just my thoughts on the matter. Those are the most important, most widely spoken languages in the world, I guess. What do you think? Which ones are the most important? Leave your comments below and let's have a chat about it. All right. Thank you very much. Talk to you later.
