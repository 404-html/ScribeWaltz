Speaker 1:          00:00          Hm. What's the topic of today's video? No, that's far too general. No, it's not that either. No, I already made a video on that one.

Speaker 2:          00:11          Yes, that's it. Hello everyone. Welcome to the Lange Focus Channel and my name is Paul. Today I'm going to talk about the Russian language. Why is Russian important? Well, Russia is one of the world's major languages. It is one of the six official languages of the United Nations and it is the eighth most widely spoken language in the world with around $155 million native speakers and around 260 million speakers in total. If we include second language speakers. It's an official language in Russia of course, but also in Belo Reus, Tajikistan, Kurgestan and Kazakhstan. It is also an official language and 38 other unrecognized states, autonomous territories and regions in Ukraine, Moldova and Georgia, and also a few localities in Romania and the Russian economic zone in Spitsbergen in Norway. It is also widely spoken as a second language on a Lingua Franca, throughout much of Central Asia, the Caucasus region, and in eastern Europe.

Speaker 2:          01:05          Even in a lot of places where it is not an official language, that's why Russian is important. Russian is the most widely spoken language of the Slavic language family. Have a look at my video on the Slavic language family here to learn more about it in detail, but in brief the Slavic languages or a branch of the Indo European language family and the beginning of the Slavic language. Branch traces back to a language called Slavek, which existed around 500 ce. Over the next few hundred years, Prodo slavek split into three varieties, west Slavic, south Slavic and east Slavek, which eventually diverged into branches of the Slavic language family containing numerous languages. Each Russian is an East Slavic language, along with Belorussian Ukrainian, and also routine at the time that these three branches developed, there was a single slavic literary language that all Slavs could understand that language was old church slavonic. Russian has written in the cyrillic script, which was created for the purpose of writing old church slavonic until the 14th century. The ancestors of modern day Russians, Ukrainians, and Belarusians living in a state called Kevin. Russ spoke dialects of old East Slavic. The spoken language existed alongside the literary language of Old Church Slavonic, a situation of glossier.

Speaker 2:          02:18          There is, however, some evidence that people used to write in the spoken vernacular for some kinds of casual writing. Birchbark letters from the town of Nevada road in the 14th century are written in the vernacular language and the concern topics of daily life. Old Church slavonic, however, it was the literary and religious language in the 13th century CE Kevin risk was conquered by the Mongol Empire, which brought a lot of foreign Turkic loan words into the East Slavic dialect, especially words related to political and financial matters. After the end of Mongol rule, in the 14th century, the oldest Slavic area was split into two separate states, the Grand Duchy of Moscow to the east and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania to the West in the general area of Ukraine, Belarus, and Lithuania. The oldest Slavic dialects in those two states began to split and develop in different directions. In the West, the Ruthenian language emerged with heavy Polish influence, Ruthenian dialects would later develop into Ukrainian and in in the east Russia, and emerged with much more influence from old church slavonic.

Speaker 2:          03:15          Modern Russian today resulted from a kind of tug of war between an old church slavonic on the one hand and the vernacular spoken dialects on the other hand. For example, in 1453 ce, after the fall of the Byzantine Empire, Byzantine and Bulgarian scholars began moving to Moscow and they were upset that old church slavonic had become corrupted or crucified, and they tried to standardize the language to remove these impurities. So a unique Russian language had begun to emerge, but scholars pulled the language back towards old church slavonic. But then during the rule of Peter the great from 1696 to 1725, the written language was pulled in a different direction away from old church slavonic. In order to increase literacy, he simplified the orthography of the written language, eliminating some letters and some diacritics. He also made great efforts to modernize and westernize Russia and started to Orient Russia towards Europe and French became the common language of the upper classes in Russia.

Speaker 2:          04:09          As you might guess, this resulted in the adoption of some French loan words into Russian. He also oversaw the intentional adoption of specialized modern vocabulary from various European languages like French, Dutch, and German. Peter, the great's reforms were some of the first steps in the development of modern literary Russian, the basis of standard Russian today, another influential person in the development of modern literary Russian was Mikaila Luminoso in 1755. He wrote a grammar of the Russian language which revolutionized the written language by combining old church slavonic with the spoken language throughout the grammar. He refers to old church slavonic as the language of high style and he refers to the spoken language as the language of low style and he advocated a blended middle style for most forms of writing. The high style was basically reserved for religious texts and the low style was reserved for the most casual written material in the following decades.

Speaker 2:          04:59          Authors and poets developed a new middle style that would form the core of modern standard Russian. The most influential was the poet Alexander Pushkin, who was sometimes referred to as the father of the modern Russian language. He fully developed the idea of three different language registers, high, middle and low, making the spoken vernacular, a legitimate part of the language. He also greatly expanded the vocabulary of literary Russian by directly translating phrases and idioms from other languages. He greatly influenced modern literary, Russian, and as a result of modern standard Russian, which formed during this time based on the literary language

Speaker 2:          05:34          in the 20th century, Russian underwent some small changes mainly in orthography, but by far the most important thing to happen to the language was the creation of the Soviet empire, universal schooling and the mass media spread, modern standard Russian and reduced dialectal variation in Russian. It also spread the language over a vast geographic area covering all the member states of the USSR. Today, Russian is still widely spoken in all of those areas and is a common lingua Franca between different ethnic groups and between the citizens of different countries. So what does Russian like orthography Russian is written in cyrillic script, an alphabet consisting of 33 letters which were mostly developed from Greek letters, some of the same as letters of the Latin alphabet, but some of the sounds they represent are different like this one

Speaker 3:          06:18          phonology.

Speaker 2:          06:19          There are 21 consonants in Russian, but 15 of them can be pronounced in two different ways, either hard or soft, and you have to judge which sound to make by looking at the letter that comes after the continent. The soft sound is palletized, meaning that part of your tongue reaches the roof of your mouth. This makes the consonant kind of sound like it's followed by a y sound. Here are some examples.

Speaker 3:          06:38          Buck, buck, buck, buck model, mel pro suck, suck vowels.

Speaker 2:          06:48          There are six basic vowels in Russian, but there's a lot of variation in the vowels depending on the surrounding sounds and based on the stress pattern of the work that wills are often reduced when they appear in an unstressed syllable. This can make it a challenge to pronounce words correctly based on their spelling. Grammar. Russian is a fusional language, meaning that suffixes and prefixes are added to root words to communicate grammatical meaning. Let's look at nouns first. There are six now in cases in Russian, meaning that both the singular and the plural form of unowned can't take six different forms depending on their grammatical function in the sentence. Let's look at an example using the word for sister nominative case.

Speaker 3:          07:25          Sister, the sister reads genitive case since three years now, misses three. I know the sister's name, date of case series three. Sister, the brother gave the sister a ticket. Accusative case says through visits, through the brother sees the sister. Instrumental case says Roy Roy, I live with the sister. Prepositional case says three masses on the sister.

Speaker 2:          07:56          On a side note, it's interesting to notice the cognate vocabulary between Russian and English and some other European languages. Just the his sister, his brother mediate his ticket, and even the word foresee reminds me of the Italian word Vedanta, which means to see. So here we see some clear indications of Russian being an Indo European language. Now, back to the noun cases. The case endings are different depending on the gender of the now. Russia nouns are grouped according to gender, with masculine, feminine and Neuter Nouns. You can normally tell the nouns gender based on its ending. Feminine Nouns can take either of these endings, neuter. Nouns can take either of these endings and masculine nouns. The nouns ending in any other letter. The one tricky exception is that some nouns and in this letter, and these can be either masculine or feminine, so you need to memorize the gender of those ones.

Speaker 2:          08:44          Adjectives, adjectives and Russian are quite complicated. They are inflicted to agree with the Noun they modified in gender number and in case that means that any particular adjective can 24 different forums like this. Wow. Let's look at a couple of examples. This is the adjective meaning new in the nominative case. No Hilton over here. This is a new car in the genitive case, Nova, Nova. After my Buddha, the new car's color so we can see how the ending of the adjective changes to make it agree with the noun, but it's worth noting that the inflectional endings added to the adjective or different from those added to the now, so you need to memorize a big set of endings for nouns and when to use them, but you have to memorize a whole different set of endings for adjectives and when to use those verbs. The Russian language has three verb tenses, past, present, and future.

Speaker 2:          09:38          That sounds straightforward, but Russian verbs are also distinguished based on something called aspect. There's the perfective aspect, which means that an action has been completed once. Then there's the imperfection of aspect which shows that the action is still in progress, still ongoing, or that it's an action that will be recurring, will be repeated many times in Russian verbs. There are two different verb stems for the imperfections and the perfect aspect, basically like two different words. Let's look at an example for the verb meaning to write first. The perfective visa and the imperfection of Pisa. Either of these stems can be conjugated for past, present, and future tenses. Let's look at an example of how aspect changes the meaning of a sentence. This sentence uses the verb with perfective verb stem and is in the future tense. Yanna. Can you go this sentence means I will write a book, but when we take the aspect into account that the meaning is I will write one specific book and action that will be completed.

Speaker 2:          10:32          This next sentence uses the imperfection verb stem and is also in the future tense. Besides the meaning of this one is more like I will be writing a book. In other words, I will be in the process of writing a book at a certain time in the future or if we use the plural form of book, then the meaning changes. It means I will write two books Jambo besides, and that means I will write numerous books of recurring action. So in that case, the imperfection of aspect indicates a slightly different meaning. Basic word order the most common word order in Russian as Svo, but because of the case system, the word order is much more flexible than it is in English and English. We normally judge the function of a word depending on where it is in the sentence, but in Russian we have the case system.

Speaker 2:          11:14          The case endings can tell us the function of the word so you can move the words around and we still understand what the subject is, what the object is and so on. So a basic sentence might be of course gripped by Malama, meaning the cat caught the most, but you could also have much by molecule or by Mahler, Gorshkov and some other possible word orders, so the basic word order is flexible like that. However, in some cases the context or the style that you are trying to communicate it and will determine the word order articles, like most Slavic languages, Russian doesn't have any articles. It doesn't have words like [inaudible] or the. If you have any Russian speaking friends who dropped the articles when they're speaking English, that's probably the reason. So how hard is rushing to learn? Well, according to the American Foreign Service Institute, Russian is a category four language, the most difficult categories, category five, and that includes Japanese, mandarin, and Arabic, but Russian is in category four.

Speaker 2:          12:07          That means that it's relatively difficult for English speakers, but not the most difficult. The most challenging things will likely be the inflection of nouns and adjectives as well as the system of verbal aspect. Some people mistakenly assume that the cyrillic alphabet is going to be the most challenging part of learning Russian, but people actually learn that fairly quickly once they start rushing as a major global language. That will be very useful to you if you spend any time in Russia or in any of the former Soviet republics. So your efforts will be well rewarded. So the question of the day, for people who have studied Russian, what did you find challenging about Russia and what did you find straightforward about Russian and for native speakers of Russia? Russia is a huge country. Do you notice a lot of variation in the way that Russia has spoken in different parts of the countries? Are there noticeable accents or dialects these days?
