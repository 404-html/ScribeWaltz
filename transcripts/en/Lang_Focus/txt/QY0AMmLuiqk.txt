Speaker 1:          00:00          Follow lane focus on facebook, twitter, and instagram. Uh, what should we do today? Today? Let's talk about Chinese. No, let's talk about written Chinese. No, let's talk about classical Chinese or maybe standard Chinese. No, no. We're going to talk about various Chinese dialects. Okay. Let's just talk about all of them.

Speaker 1:          00:23          Hello everyone. Welcome to the Lange Focus Channel and my name is Paul. Today we're going to talk about Chinese, but the big question is what do I mean when I say Chinese? The word Chinese refers to standard Chinese, which is based on Mandarin, but it also refers to a large group of languages and dialects spoken throughout China and indeed throughout the world. Chinese languages also called synetic languages or a sub family of the silo. Tibetan language family. Chinese is not a single language, but rather a number of related dialect groups which are united by a common written language, a common writing system. Some people consider them all Chinese dialects, but I'm going to refer to these dialect groups as distinct languages because in many cases they are unintelligible. All Chinese languages are tonal languages. The meaning of a word depends on the tone or the tones that you say it with. Sure. She Shit, if you change the tone, the meaning of the word changes, there were more than 1.3 billion native speakers of Chinese. If we include all its varieties. Standard Chinese generally referred to as Mandarin is the official language of the People's Republic of China, the Republic of China, also known as Taiwan or Chinese. Taipei.

Speaker 2:          01:37          Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:37          And it's one of the four official languages of Singapore. Chinese languages are also spoken in lots of diaspora communities throughout Asia, like in Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand and in different communities around the world.

Speaker 1:          01:50          History, the sign nick languages or the Chinese languages developed from Prodo Sino Tibetan, which existed perhaps around 4,000 bce. The earliest written examples of Chinese are from around 1250 bce. They were written using a form of Chinese called the oracle bone script, which was carved onto turtle shells and animal bones, which were used for divination, like a kind of fortune telling, a more recognizable form of old Chinese developed during the Jo Dynasty between 10:46 AM two 56 bce. It can be found on bronze sculptures from that time period as well as in some literature like a classic of poetry. It's generally thought that during this early time period Chinese had not yet developed tones. Those develops later in the transition to middle Chinese, the form of written Chinese that developed between this period and the end of the Han Dynasty in the third century. Ce is known as classical Chinese or literary Chinese.

Speaker 1:          02:47          Classical Chinese continued to be used as the formal written language until the beginning of the 20th century spoken. Chinese continued to evolve into middle Chinese. Middle Chinese is ancestor of almost all modern Chinese varieties. The exception is Min Chinese, which developed earlier maybe during the Han period. Middle Chinese was not a single unified language, but consisted of a number of mutually intelligible dialects that began diverging in different directions around the 10th century Ce, and you'll probably hear me say that every time I talk about a language family, those local varieties of Chinese continued to develop in their own directions as distinct languages over the centuries with a lot of local dialectal variation within each language. As I mentioned before, classical Chinese was being used as the formal written language, but during this time period written vernacular, Chinese also developed alongside it, written for an ocular Chinese refers to ways of writing Chinese that reflect the spoken language in its different varieties.

Speaker 1:          03:47          These forms of Chinese were used for some informal writing. People were already writing and written vernacular, Chinese during the tongue and some dynasties from the seventh to 13th century CE, old Mandarin. After the Northern Song Dynasty and during the gene and you end dynasties, a language recognizable as a form of mentoring was spoken. This variety of Chinese is known as Old Mandarin. The UN dynasty was a period of Mongol control of China. The world's leading up to the Mongol conquest caused large scale migration of old mandarin speakers to the south. This spread early mandarin dialects to more areas and also had an influence on other emerging Chinese languages. Middle Mandarin during the Ming and Ching dynasties and official administrative language was created based on the mandarin dialect of the capitol non Jean with some features of other dialects as well. This was the first point at which the language became referred to as Mandarin, which means speech of officials.

Speaker 1:          04:45          We now refer to the stage of the language as middle mandarin in the late 19th century towards the end of the Ching Dynasty. The specific dialect of Beijing started to grow in importance and became the new high variety of Chinese replacing the older high variety which was based on a number of different dialects at the beginning of the 20th century, a form of written vernacular, Chinese based on a number of mandarin dialects was introduced as the new official written language instead of classical Chinese, but it was later decided that the new official language should be based specifically on the Beijing dialect. This new standard language was called, which means common language or which means national language. People often refer to this standard language as mandarin because it's based on the mandarin dialect of Beijing. But to be precise, the word mandarin refers to a range of northern dialect.

Speaker 1:          05:39          Standard Chinese or Mandarin now fulfills the role that classical Chinese used to fulfill as the official written language that's used by speakers of all varieties of Chinese for most purposes, but written vernacular languages still do exist and are used for some informal situations. So how many varieties of Chinese are there? Well, that depends on how you're counting and categorizing them, but it's often said that there are over 200 distinct varieties of Chinese, which comprise around 13 distinct dialect can groups the local dialects within each of these groups are often intelligible. So it's reasonable to consider these groups as languages at least I think so. Out of these 13 groups of dialects, there are seven that are generally considered a major. These are mandarin UAA Shung men by done gone. You

Speaker 3:          06:31          and hot got, Huh?

Speaker 1:          06:34          The writing system, Chinese is written in Chinese characters or Hudson Han. Soo are logograms single characters that represent entire words or entire units of meaning. For example, this character means China. In this character means character as in a written character and together they mean Chinese character or Han Zu, the kind we're talking about. These characters need to be learned one by one because just knowing the pronunciation of a word doesn't give you any indication of how to write it. Speakers of all varieties of Chinese typically right in standard Chinese or mandarin, even though their spoken language is different when the reading standard Chinese out loud, they'll probably pronounce each character the way it's pronounced in their local variety of Chinese. This has led to the common misconception that all Chinese languages are exactly the same except for their pronunciation. The fact is Chinese languages often differ in grammar and vocabulary as well as pronunciation.

Speaker 1:          07:30          The various forms of written vernacular, Chinese that developed alongside classical Chinese still exist today alongside standard Chinese. They're only used in some limited situations, but Cantonese in particular is fairly widely used from what I understand most of the characters used are the same, but there'll be pronounced differently and some different characters might be used to represent the different vocabulary and the order of the characters might be different to represent the different syntax. Pronunciation, as previously mentioned, Chinese languages are tonal. That means that tones are one part of the pronunciation that can change the meaning of a word. The same written word can be pronounced very differently in different Chinese languages. This is the word for telephone first in Mandarin, next in Cantonese in Wa, in Shanghainese, and then Haka. Let me explain a little further. Mandarin has four main tones plus one neutral tone. The tones are number one, a high flat tone to arising tone, three uh, falling. Rising tone for uh, falling tone and five, the neutral tone, meaning that syllable is not distinguished by tone at all.

Speaker 3:          08:42          Ma Ma, Ma, Ma, ma.

Speaker 1:          08:46          Now Cantonese has six tones. The six cantor. These tones are number one, a high flat tone to amid rising tome three amid flat tone for a low falling tone. Five a low rising tone and six a low flat tone.

Speaker 4:          09:03          Si, Si, Si, Si, Si, Si.

Speaker 1:          09:10          Shanghainese has a different type of tone system entirely. It's more of a pitch accent system like Japanese. There were really only two tones high and low. At the tone of the first syllable determines the tone pattern of the following syllables. The you hear, the first syllable has a low tone, which depends on the character that makes the second syllable high and it doesn't matter what character it is. Tone is only connected to meaning in the first syllable word order. There are both similarities and differences in the word order of Chinese languages. Mandarin is generally svo though it's Sov and some structures and Cantonese is also Svo more so than member Shanghainese and other Wu dialects are both Svo and Sov. So in Mandarin we have who? Courtroom, which means I drink juice. Here's the subject, verb and object. And in Cantonese, all young goal, it's up again, subject, verb, object.

Speaker 1:          10:07          And now in Shanghainese. Ooh, took in these examples, it turns out that the word orders the same, but notice that each language uses a different character for the verb to reflect different vocabulary. Let's look at another element of word order mandarin places an indirect object before the direct object. Cantonese places at after the direct object like in this sentence, which means give me the book in Mandarin, Gay Weapons. So we're forward. It's give me book and in Cantonese bape and the single word for word, it's give book me and a few. Imagine a two in there. It's like give book to me. Also noticed the character for give is different here and in Shanghainese oh bones hear the word order is like mandarin, but notice the different word for give and the variant character for me. Another example of difference mandarin or standard Chinese places. The adverb before the verb.

Speaker 1:          11:03          This sentence means I'll go first in member in it, boy, since all word for word, it's I first go, but Cantonese places, the adverb after the verb, all it's llc work forward. It's I go first and in Shanghainese we'll see about tele here. The main word order is the same as mandarin with the advert before the verb, but notice the additional particles at the end which are four exclamation but don't have any core meaning. Another example difference mandarin places, the adjective after the noun, so the phrase meaning strong wind in Mandarin. It's literally when the strong from how Cantonese places the adjective before the noun, so literally it's strong wind hold iphone and in Shanghainese Fun loud to hear the adjective comes after the now just like in Mandarin, but notice that one of the two characters is different. Those are just a few samples of the variation between the different Chinese languages and their dialects. We could go very deeply into these differences, but that's beyond the scope of this general video.

Speaker 1:          12:09          One other difference we should talk about though is that there are two different systems for writing Chinese characters. There are traditional characters, the ones that are written as they weren't in classical Chinese and then there are simplified characters which were created in the 1950s and sixties to increase literacy. Simplified characters are used in the People's Republic of China and in Singapore. Traditional characters are used in Taiwan and in Hong Kong and Macau which were not under Chinese rule. When simplified characters were introduced. There are also used in many Chinese diaspora communities. Here's the traditional character on the left and here's that. Simplify the equivalent on the right so you can see that they are different and it's probably easier to write the simplified loan, but despite the differences, literate native speakers generally have no trouble reading either type of character. As you can see, the scientific language family, which is often called Chinese, is a large diverse group of languages and dialects which are often unintelligible.

Speaker 1:          13:04          What unites them all together is there shared origin and growing out of middle Chinese and the classical Chinese literary tradition, and there are also united by a common written language which is learned and understood by speakers of all Chinese varieties. However, even though speakers of different Chinese languages can easily communicate with each other in writing, that shared writing system isn't enough to help them communicate verbally without specifically learning Mandarin. This is a good reason to consider Chinese a group of languages or a language family rather than a single language with many dialects. Solve the question of the day to native speakers of any variety of Chinese. Do you consider Chinese to be a group of distinct languages or do you consider it one language with a lot of dialectal variation? And I'm just asking you to explain the way that you personally think about it. So there's no right or wrong answer here. And for people who have studied any variety of Chinese, just tell us something that you've found fascinating about your journey with that language.

And once again, I'd like to say thank you to all of my fantastic patrion supporters, especially these amazing people right here on the screen. Thank you for watching and have a nice.
