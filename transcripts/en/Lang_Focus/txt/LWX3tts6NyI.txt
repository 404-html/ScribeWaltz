Speaker 2:          00:10          good evening and welcome to the Lange focus channel. This is a quick video to bring you some breaking news from the linguistic world. According to recently released documents, the European Union will soon be adopting Esperanto as an official language for those who don't know, Esperanto is a constructed language that was created in the 18 slash 17 by Dr ll Zimmerman Hoff. It was created in order to function as an international auxiliary language that people all around the world can learn and it was intentionally designed to be extremely easy to learn, but Esperanto never fully caught on and remained mostly a hobby for language nerds. Until now. According to EU officials, Esperanto will be designated the 25th official language of the European Union and will function as a working language of the European Parliament as well as a procedural language of the European Commission in addition to English, French, and German. The EU is also expected to soon recommend that all member states begin drafting plans for public school educational programs in Esperanto.

Speaker 2:          01:09          The unofficial word on the street is that with the coming departure of the UK, from the European Union, enthusiasm for learning English is declining and Esperanto is a viable longterm option to replace English as the international language. This new European Union policy will begin on April 30, first 2017. This is wonderful news for Esperanto lovers all around the world.
