Speaker 2:          01:58          All right. That's just another little sample of my progress and to gallog how it's going. Um, uh, obviously I'm not fluent. I can express myself about simple things. I could make simple sentences, I can communicate about basic things with basic vocab, but for three weeks in I'm pretty happy with how things are going. Um, I'm looking forward to my trip to Philippines next week and I'll try out my to gallog they're more and practice more and I'm going to study while I'm there and hopefully that will expand my ability even more. Tagalog is an interesting experience. The only other thing I can compare it to is when I started studying Japanese way back in the beginning years and years ago, because before that I had only studied languages that were much more similar to English. Like I had studied French in school, I had studied Hebrew and modern Hebrew kind of has syntax that's similar to English.

Speaker 2:          02:51          Like the word order is different from biblical Hebrew. It's more like English. So when I started learning Japanese, the word order and the grammar and sentence structure, something completely different. It kind of was difficult at first and freaked me out a bit. Like, because I had to think in a whole new way and piece together. The ideas to make sentences in a completely new way. It couldn't just change out the words like you can in some other languages. And now Tagalog is kind of similar to that. Similar to the old days when I started Japanese and I was freaking out about this completely new way of expressing myself and to Gal looks Kinda like that, that you can't just change the words out into a tagalog words. You can't just take an English sentence and change the words and to, to Gallog it won't happen, won't, you won't be able to express yourself like that at all. No one would understand that. Totally different experience. So that's quite fun. Quite interesting to do that. It's quite mind bending and it makes me think in new ways and I always enjoy that. So yeah, that's another look at how it's going. I hope you are busy studying too and improving at whatever language you're focused on. Good night.
