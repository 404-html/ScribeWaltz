Speaker 1:          00:00          I have no idea how to make a funny introduction for this video, so instead I'm going to give you a quick slideshow of cool, awesome slavek stuff.

Speaker 2:          00:07          Go.

Speaker 1:          00:18          Hello everyone. Welcome to the Lange Focus Channel and my name is Paul. Today I'm going to talk about the Slavic languages. They may not get as much attention as the romance languages and the Germanic languages, but the Slavic languages are an important family of languages with $315 million native speakers and covering over half the area of Europe. That includes Eastern Europe, the balcones as well as the European part of Russia, and of course the Asian part of Russia as well, Slavic languages or a branch of the Indo European language family. If we go all the way back to the beginning that there was a language called [inaudible], Indo European, which is the language from which all Indo European languages descended. That includes the romance languages. That dramatic language is to enjoy running in languages and of course the Slavic languages as well as others. One language that developed from Indo European was pro tow Bulto Slavic.

Speaker 1:          01:10          That language is the ancestor of both the Baltic languages and the Slavic languages, but the Slavic language family broke off from Provo Balto slavek around 1,500 to 1000 bce. The language then underwent a 2000 year period of gradual development, but during that time it remained a single unified language around 500 ce. There was a language called protos slavic that would later split and would give birth to all of the modern Slavic languages of today. Protos slavek was the ancestor of all Slavic languages. The time between 500 cm, 1000 ce was called the common slavek period, and during this period, protos slavek began to diverge into dialects and that Slavic people migrated over a wider area. Those differences increased by about $1,000. Seed there were distinct west Slavek, east Slavic and South Slavic languages. Those three languages would later become three branches of the Slavic language family, and the dialects of those languages would become the different languages in each branch.

Speaker 1:          02:10          The East Slavic languages include Russian, Ukrainian, and Bella Lucien, which is sometimes called White Russian, South Slavic language family includes Serbo, Croatian, Bulgarian Macedonian, which are very similar, Slovenian, and also the liturgical language known as old church. Slavonic slavonic just means Slavic. The West Slavic languages include Polish, Czech, Slovak, Serbian, which is a minority language in eastern Germany, job in which is a minority language. In Poland, the Slavic languages are much closer to each other then the languages of other into European language families. That's because protos slavek split into different languages relatively recently compared to other language families like Germanic and romance. Some people claimed that all slavic languages are mutually intelligible to a large degree, but that's not really true, but from what I understand, the speaker of any Slavic language can probably find a way to make some sort of simple conversation with the speaker of any other Slavic language or most other Slavic languages.

Speaker 1:          03:13          That doesn't mean they can understand everything, but that means when they're talking face to face, maybe they can find a way to communicate and within each of those three branches of the language family, there seems to be quite a lot of mutual intelligibility. For example, the East slavek branch, here are some average figures from native speakers statements on the Internet, so for Russian speakers, Bella Lucien is about 74 percent intelligible and it's spoken for them an 85 percent intelligible in its written form. Ukrainian is 50 percent intelligible and it's spoken for them and 85 percent intelligible in its written form, but in both cases there were also a transitional dialects. For example, the Ukrainian is more similar to the Russian dialects in the south of the country rather than the standard language which is based on dialects of the north, so speakers of those southern Russian dialects might have an easier time communicating with someone from Ukraine.

Speaker 1:          04:03          Here's another example from a lang focus viewer named anointed fighter. He says, I'm a native Bulgarian speaker. I can understand 80 percent Serbian and 80 percent Russian, especially if they are written Czech Slovakia and Slovenia and I can get 60 percent and from Polish only 40 percent to Bulgaria and Serbia and are both part of the South Slavic branch so he can understand 80 percent of Serbian, but he can also understand 80 percent of Russian even though it's in the East slavek branch. Slavic was still a single unified language in the ninth century when the first known slavic writings were written. These writings were written in old church slavonic slavonic just means slavek. Remember it was the first slavek literary language and it was standardized by the Saint Cyril and methodius so that they could translate the Bible and other religious works into the Slavic language and they could minister to the slabs and convert them to Christianity.

Speaker 1:          04:55          At this point, there were slavic dialects, but they were still relatively close to each other. So old church slavonic was widely understood. Old Church slavonic went on to become the language of religious ceremony for the eastern Orthodox Church and the eastern Catholic church, and it's still used by many churches today. One of the writing system, Cyril and methodius used to write old church slavonic was the cyrillic script, so the word cyrillic comes from the Saints Names Cyril. The cyrillic script was adapted from the old Greek script with some additional letters to represent sounds found in old church slavonic that were not found in Greek today. There are Slavic languages written in cyrillic script and there are also those written in variations of the Latin script. Those written in the cyrillic script tend to be for cultures in which the eastern Orthodox or eastern Catholic church are dominant. Those written in the Latin script tend to be for cultures in which the Roman Catholic church is dominant.

Speaker 1:          05:48          One of the common features of Slavic languages aside from Bulgarian and Macedonian is that the nouns and pronouns are highly inflected. Have many grammatical cases. Grammatical case means that the noun or a pronoun changes form depending on its function in the sentence in English. The only example we have of this is with the pronouns. For example, I is the subject for him and me is the object form, but nouns can have multiple forums like this as well. If they have grammatical cases, Slavic languages have up to seven different grammatical cases. Let's look at an example for the Polish word for bottle with Telefonica Boutiquey hotel. It's a Teleco Teleco. We tell them say, so the word bottle changes form depending on which case it's being used. I won't go through each one and say which case it is, but you can see that the form of the noun changes for people whose native language is not a highly inflected language with grammatical cases like that.

Speaker 1:          06:43          This can make learning a slavic language, a challenge. You not only have to memorize those different forums, but when you're speaking, you have to constantly be aware of which form the word should be, which function the word is fulfilling in the sentence. Another characteristic of Slavic languages is that they don't have articles. That means like the or are in English, and again the exception is Bulgarian and Macedonian. For some reason the lack of grammatical cases and the presence of articles might make Bulgarian Macedonian easier to learn, but the most widely studied slavic language is Russian and that's probably because it's the most widely spoken. There are $150 million native speakers of Russian, and if we include second language speakers, there are $260 million proficient speakers. The second most widely spoken is Polish with around $40 million native speakers. The third most widely spoken is Ukrainian with about $30 million speakers.

Speaker 1:          07:34          The fourth is Serbo Croatian with about 19 million speakers and yes, I know some people consider those to be separate languages, but I will leave that topic for a different video for now. The fifth is checked with 10 million people and of course there are numerous other important slavic languages to really. There's so much to say about the various different Slavic languages that I can't talk about it all in one video, but please stay tuned for future videos in which I talk about specific Slavic languages. So that brings us to the end of this video. But the question of the day for Slavic language speakers is can you communicate with the speakers of different slavic languages and if so, which ones? Is it just the ones in your language branch, like East Slavek or South Slavic, or can you communicate with the speakers in other branches as well? Let us know in the comments down below and other people you can comment about whatever you want. Alright. Thank you for watching and have a nice.
