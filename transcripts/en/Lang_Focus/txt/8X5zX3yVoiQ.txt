Speaker 1:          00:05          Hello everyone, welcome to the channel and my name is Paul. Today's topic is the Scots language. Scott's is a language spoken in Scotland, one of the constituent countries of the United Kingdom. Right off the bat, it's important to point out that there are essentially three different languages in Scotland, Scottish, English, Scott's and garlic. Garlic is a Celtic language that is only distantly related to English and Scots as an endo European language. Scott, since Scottish, English on the other hand, are closely related to each other, though they're not the same thing. Scottish English is for the most part standard English, but spoken with a Scottish accent. Scott's on the other hand, is distinct having diverged from a dialect of middle English and having features that differ from English. Some people consider Scott's to be a separate language while others consider it to be a historical dialect of English, just like the historical dialects found in England, but we'll get into that a little bit later.

Speaker 1:          00:58          According to the 2011 Scottish census, just over one point $5 million people speak. Scott's around 30 percent of the Scottish population history. The roots of Scott's lion, north Umbria and old English, one of several old English dialects, Northumbria and old English was being spoken by the seventh century in the Anglo Saxon Kingdom of North Umbria, which was located in northeastern England, and part of the Scottish lowlands. The Kingdom of Scotland was founded in the year 8:43 with the unification of the pig dish people and golic speaking. Scott's but English speaking. Northumbria and lance were not yet part of the kingdom when the northern part of North Umbria finally became part of Scotland. In the 11th century, Golic became the prestige language of the area, but English remained the most widely spoken language. The variety of English spoken there may have been significantly influenced by norse because the southern part of North Umbria, along with much of northern and eastern England, had been under Danish control and it's English.

Speaker 1:          01:58          Dialects had been influenced by norse and Scandinavian settlers were also present beyond the border of that area as well. In the twelfth and 13th centuries during the middle English period, the [inaudible] system of administrative division led to the spread of English further into Scotland borrows. We're autonomous urban communities where traders, merchants, and craftsmen could live and do business in exchange for paying taxes on their earnings. The bureaus were ruled by nobles who answered to the King. They attract an economic migrants from other parts of Scotland, including golic speaking areas from England, especially from areas that had been under Danish control, where North's influenced dialects were spoken and from farther away places like flenders, phrygia and Scandinavia. English became the common language of the boroughs, but the multilingual environment created by the economic migrants had an influence on the language, so as English became more widespread in Scotland because of the boroughs, it also began to diverged from North Umbria and middle English.

Speaker 1:          02:55          Other influences were Latin because of its role as the ecclesiastical and the language of laws and record keeping and Norman French because of the influence of King David. The first who had close ties with Norman England. The divergent variety of middle English that grew out of these influences is now referred to as early Scott's, but at the time it continued to be referred to as English until the end of the 15th century. In the 14th and 15th centuries, English replaced and garlic and much of the lowlands as well as replacing French as the administrative language, as well as replacing Latin as the language of records and law. Another thing that happened in the 15th century was that the Orkney islands and the Shetland islands came under Scottish rule. Scandinavian settlers had been living on these islands since the ninth century and spoke a language called norm that derived from old norse, but Scott speaking, settlers began to move there and the prestige language became Scott's from this contact.

Speaker 1:          03:49          New dialects of Scott's would develop with more influence than other forms of Scott's. These dialects are shetland, Scott's and slash or Kadian, Scott's or orkney. By this point, scots had become fairly distinct from English as spoken in England. One thing that set them apart was that the southern English dialect of London was becoming the standard in England, whereas Scott's had more in common with the northern dialects. Another thing that set them apart was the great vowel shift. The great vowels shift took place between the years 13, 15 and 1600 more or less and caused vowels of English to be pronounced differently. This also affected Scott's, although the specific changes we're different and some vowels that changed in English remained unchanged. In Scott's, for example, in middle English, the letters, Oh, you represented the sound uhhh in southern English, and thus in standard English, this sounds shifted to our, but in Scott's, it remained unchanged.

Speaker 1:          04:43          So today in standard English you say mouse, but in Scott's you say Moose and a brown cow and English is a Brune coup in scots who knew broom? The great vowel shifts took place at about the same time that English orthography was becoming standardized, so that English spelling often reflected earlier middle English pronunciation, and it still does today. Scott's on the other hand, was written more freely to reflect the way it was really pronounced. An extensive body of Scott's literature was written in the 15th and 16th centuries, but towards the end of that time period, as English was growing in prestige, Scott's was increasingly being written using a combination of scots and English.
