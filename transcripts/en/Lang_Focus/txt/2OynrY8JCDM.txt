Speaker 1:          00:00          Hello everyone, welcome to the Lange Focus Channel and my name is Paul. Today I'm going to answer the question, is English really a Germanic language? If you've seen any of my videos on Germanic languages, like my Afrikaans video, like my Dutch video, like my German video or like my north dramatic languages video, then you probably saw that English is also a Germanic language, but a lot of people write comments, expressing some confusion over this. They write things like, Paul, are you sure it's a Germanic language? Are you sure it's not a romance language? Well, that's a good question. If a native English speaker who had never learned another language before, had to look at a page of French and then had a look at a page of German or Dutch, they would probably be able to understand more of the page of French or if they had to look at a page of Spanish or a page of Italian, they would probably be able to pick out a lot of words that they recognize, but on the other hand, if they looked at a page of Dutch or German, they probably wouldn't be able to pick out as many without deciphering the words a little bit first.

Speaker 1:          00:52          So in that case, why is English a Germanic language and not a romance language in the field of linguistics? Languages are categorized according to their genetic relationship. Genetic relationship means that they have a common ancestor and therefore they have some common features that distinguish them from other groups of languages. This type of genetic relationship between languages can commonly be seen in the grammar and syntax of the language, but the current vocabulary of the language is not really taken into account in its categorization. Even when a language has a huge number of loan words and it's vocabulary changes a lot. That does not change the categorization of that language. So because English developed from Provo Germanic, it is a Germanic language, despite massive changes that have taken place in its vocabulary. The vocabulary of English has been highly influenced by romance languages. Romance meaning Latin in any language that has developed from Latin, like French, Spanish, Italian cetera.

Speaker 1:          01:42          So how much has it been influenced? Well, English vocabulary is 26 percent Germanic and it's 29 percent French. Wait, you're telling me that there's more French vocabulary than Germanic vocabulary even though it's a Germanic language, that's all. Oh, but wait, there's also 29 percent Latin vocabulary. So that means together 58 percent of English vocabulary comes from romance languages. Wow. That's more than I thought. Another six percent comes from Greek. Another four percent comes from other languages in four percent comes from proper names. I can't really think of any vocabulary that comes from proper names aside from randy. So if we ignore the origins of English and that's grammar and syntax and just focus on the vocabulary for a minute, then English is largely a romance language. How did so much romance vocabulary enter English? Much of the French vocabulary entered English after the Norman conquest of 10 66.

Speaker 1:          02:35          The Norman spoke of regional French dialect called old Norman or Norman French. The upper classes in England spoke French for around 300 years. English was influenced by the Norman French dialect, but also by Parisian French due to its prestige and cultural influence in the following centuries, huge amounts of French vocabulary entered English and had lost much of its old English vocabulary, but in many cases there are pairs of equivalent Germanic and French vocabulary, but within those pairs there's often a slightly different meaning or usage for the Germanic word and for the French word, an interesting example or the pairs of words representing animals versus foods that come from those animals. The animals are represented by dramatic words and the foods are represented by French loan words. For example, cow comes from old English coop, but beef comes from French. Pig comes from old English, picked up, but pork comes from French Paul, but I don't know what the pronunciation would have been like in Norman.

Speaker 1:          03:24          French chief comes from old English shop, but mutton comes from old French and we don't. Snail comes from old English Snyder and escargo comes from Norman French. [inaudible] French also influenced English because of its huge cultural influence on Europe from the renaissance period to the end of the 19th century and even now to some extent, but it's not just French. There's also a lot of Latin vocabulary, some Latin enter Germanic dialects. In the early days through contact with the Roman Empire. On top of that, some Christian missionaries were present in Britain and the sixth and seventh centuries, and they introduced some Latin religious vocab into English. Many Latin words were also borrowed during the renaissance period and also during the scientific revolution of the 17th and 18th centuries were many new words were coined, coining, demeaning, newly created new words were coined from Latin roots, prefixes and suffixes to represent new concepts in science and technology and an industry.

Speaker 1:          04:14          So English is a Germanic language which absorbed a huge number of French and Latin words. Yes, basically. But some people have a different theory. Some people think that English is actually a creole language. There's something called the middle English creole hypothesis. There are big differences between old English and middle English. Of course there was the importing of lots of French vocabulary, but that alone does not make it a creole language. But there were other changes to the grammar of English which became highly simplified. There was a lot of simplification, like the loss of most now in cases and gender, so that aside from the possessive form with apostrophe s and the plural forms, most nouns in English don't have any inflection. Also, adjectives used to have inflection, but that disappeared to the word. Inflection means changes to a word to represent different grammatical categories. For example, the word cat and the cat's paw here, the apostrophe s is a kind of inflection to show possession.

Speaker 1:          05:03          And we have one most but two mice. So here the word is inflected to show plural. So let's take a simple phrase like the good king and look at it in old English, in old English. Notice that all three words in this phrase can change in the nominative case, say Gold Cuny in the accusative case, thrown a golden human in the genitive case. Fast golden keuning is in the date of case Fem, golden tuning. So the definite article changes the adjective changes and the noun changes depending on the case, but the article and adjective also changed depending on the gender and the case endings are different depending on the gender. Let's look at a similar phrase, the good Queen Sale. Goal Day Quinn thought gold on Quinn thought a go down Quinn and thought I'd go down. Quinn, notice the different feminine form of the definite article and the adjective.

Speaker 1:          05:49          This is just an example of the grammatical complexity of old English. So you can imagine how much it became simplified by the middle English period. Most of these farms disappeared or merged together. Now we just have a genitive case and the others form a common case. This is the type of simplification that happens when creoles arise. So it's very possible that old English underwent a process of creolization inserting lots of French vocabulary into an old English substrate or underlying structure, but there might have been a different reason for that simplification of English. Some people don't believe in the creole hypothesis and they point to things like some of the irregular forms that still exist in English, like irregular verbs or irregular plural forms. In a typical creole language, those forms would have been regularized, but of course creolization is not an all or nothing process.

Speaker 1:          06:33          It's possible that English was partially realized. Well, let's look at a couple of sentences in English and let's look at the influences we can find. Let's see if there's more dramatic or more romance influence. This one's a newspaper headline. Trump pushing immigration plan meets with family of women, killed in 2007. Push. This word comes from old French, pulled say, or modern French poussey immigration. This word comes from Latin [inaudible]. Good optimum plan. This word comes from the French word, which means map or ground plan meet. This comes from old English, Mayton with this comes from old English with family. This comes from the Latin Familia according to the source I used, but there's also the French word for me, which I suppose could be the source of this word comes from the old English, F or off woman. This comes from old English. We men or women kill.

Speaker 1:          07:20          This might come from the old English Quillan to quell in. This word comes from Latin, so out of those 10 words, five are dramatic and five are romance words, but let's have a look at a more casual sentence because I have a feeling that newspaper vocabulary tends towards romance vocabulary more than common speech. I had lunch with my friend and we read some books I have. This is dramatic. Comes from old English. Each had. This is also dramatic. It comes from old English, have been lunch. The origin of this one is vague, but it seems to be from a modern English dialect. Word with this is from old English with mine. This is dramatic. It comes from middle English or means friend. This comes from old English phrase and this comes from old English, Ond, or owned we. This comes from old English way. Read this comes from old English at that done, or they've done some.

Speaker 1:          08:09          This comes from old English book. This comes from old English book, so this time all of the words are almost all of the words are Germanic, so it's interesting that the majority of English vocabulary comes from French or from Latin, but in the most commonly used words in casual speech, there tends to be more dramatic vocabulary and this is a good argument in favor of English being classified as a Germanic language. So do I think that English should be classified as a Germanic language? Well, by a linguists criteria, yes, but most people don't really care about the linguists criteria. They just care about the practical application, the practical use of the language. And in practice I think the vocabulary is a very important element of the language. So I think it's fair to say that in practice English as a hybrid language, it's partly Germanic, partly romance, but that's my personal conclusion.

Speaker 1:          08:55          I'd like to know what you think. Do you think that English should be considered a Germanic language or do you think it seems more like a romance language?
