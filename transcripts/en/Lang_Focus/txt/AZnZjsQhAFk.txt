Speaker 1:          00:01          Hello everyone. Thank you for tuning into laying focus TV. I am your host Paul and today we're going to talk about the difference between informal and formal language and which one you should focus on learning when you're learning a new language. We have two special guests with us today. They both happened to be cousins of mine. One is my cousin Fred and the other is my cousin Ivan. So welcome to both of you. Yo, what's up? Okay, so let's start off by talking about some of the differences between formal language and informal language and later on we'll get into which one you should focus on learning when you learn a new language. So far more frank, I'd like to start with you. Would you tell us a little bit about formal language and how it differs from informal language? Formal speech usually mirrors the written language, so when people are speaking formally, they are speaking with the written language in mind.

Speaker 1:          00:49          They might be seeing the sentences inside their head as they are saying them. They are keeping grammar and mind. They're conscious of grammar and they're constructing those sentences carefully to follow the rules of grammar that they learned in school. And they might be using some vocabulary that they see written in books, but they don't usually use in casual conversation. And maybe the most important thing, the most important differences that they are enunciating all of the words very clearly. So the people who find the formal language quite easy to learn are people who are visual learners and people who are kind of analytical. So that gets them thinking about the different pieces of the sentence and how to put them together. Those kinds of people learn the formal language quite easily, and they're typically tend to be quite introverted. So I'm this type of person, I'm this type of learner.

Speaker 1:          01:34          I find it quite easy to learn the formal language, well, relatively easy to learn the formal language. I find it easier to learn how to understand news broadcasts in a new language than I do to understand casual conversations on the street. That's the type of learner I am naturally, just because of my personality and my learning style. I'm a visual learner. I'm introverted and I'm quite analytical. Hmm. That's all very interesting. So let's hear from informal. Ivan, can you tell us a little bit about informal language and how that's different from the formal language that frank described and the people who learned a formal language really easily.
