Speaker 1:          00:15          Hello everyone. Welcome to the Lange focus channel. Uh, my name is Paul. Today's topic is the Indonesian language or Bahasa, Indonesia as it's called in Indonesian Indonesian, as closely connected with Malaya. So if you haven't seen my video on the Malay language yet, I recommend that you watch that first before you watched this video. Indonesian is based on ballet, though it has evolved and taken on some uniquely Indonesian features. There are about 43 million native speakers of Indonesian and about 155000002nd language speakers of Indonesian, mainly in Indonesia where it's the national language and the sole official language. Why does Indonesian have so many more second language speakers than native speakers? Well, there are hundreds of languages spoken in Indonesia and Indonesia and functions as a Lingua Franca between speakers of different languages. It's the language of education and of media and these days everybody learns Indonesian, but most Indonesians still speak a different regional language as their native language plus Indonesia.

Speaker 1:          01:09          The national language. How was the Indonesian language born? Indonesian is based on the Malaya language, which has been a Lingua Franca of trade and of the elite throughout the Malay archipelago for centuries. The story of Indonesian begins during the colonial period in the early 17th century. The VOC or the Dutch east India company established a trading post at Batavia. The site of Present Day Jakarta and over the following three centuries expanded into other areas of present day Indonesia. The Dutch east India company made Molay the administrative language of its trading outpost. In 1799, the Dutch east India company went bankrupt and the Dutch government took control of the colony in the late 18th century. The British east India company had also arrived in the archipelago and an 18, 24, a treaty between the British and the Dutch divided the area between the British to the north and the Dutch to the south in the Dutch colony, the promotion of the Dutch language and education and Dutch began, but only to a limited extent, mostly for the elite compared to other colonial powers.

Speaker 1:          02:05          The Dutch were not really interested in changing the culture of the colonized people. Their main goal was to facilitate trade, therefore, since Malaya was already a Lingua Franca that could facilitate trade, there was no reason for them to introduce Dutch as a Lingua Franca. The Dutch promoted Malaya as the language of education, recognizing referral molay, the classical Malays spoken in the Malacca and Johor, nate's as the standard language, the standard form of Malaya continue to develop with the abundance of Malaya literature. In the 19th century into the 20th century, molay linguists published dictionaries and grammars to further standardize and modernize the language. The Dutch language never became widespread in Indonesia. In fact, in 1940, only two percent of Indonesians spoke Dutch, but even though the role of the Dutch language was very limited, a large number of Dutch loan words entered the Malay language in the areas under Dutch control, and this is one of the things that made the Indonesian variety of Malaya different from other varieties.

Speaker 1:          02:57          In the early 20th century, Pro Independence Movement arose and people throughout the Dutch colony began to see themselves as a single people, Indonesians. The term Indonesia was a new term for the archipelago created by European ethnologists, but adopted by nationalists in the Dutch colony at the Youth Conference of Nineteen Twenty eight. Young nationalists declared the youth pledge with three ideals, one motherland, one nation, and one language. The language they chose was the Indonesian variety of Malaya, which they named Bahasa, Indonesia. When Indonesia declared independence in 1945, Indonesian was declared the national language of the new country, but why Indonesian? At the time of independence, Indonesian was the native language of only five percent of the population. While Japanese was the native language of over 40 percent of the population. So why wasn't Japanese chosen to be the national language? Well, that would've shown favoritism to Indonesia is the largest ethnic group undermining the national unity of the country, but Indonesian previously known just as Molay had been a lingua Franca throughout the archipelago for centuries.

Speaker 1:          03:57          So people in various regions of the country already knew some molay. It was also a much simpler language than Japanese and could realistically be learned by millions of people as a second language. Indonesian turned out to be the right choice, successfully becoming the language of government education, trade and communication between people in different regions of the country. Indonesian completely replaced the form of colonial language, Dutch as the language of public life, and that's something that's very rare and former colonies today. Indonesian is still the second language of most Indonesian people, but it's becoming increasingly more common as a native language, especially in the cities. That's because people from all over the country moved to the big cities, so rather than speak their native regional languages that they speak Indonesian instead and some of them get married with each other and they raised their children speaking Indonesian as their primary language.

Speaker 1:          04:42          So what is Indonesian like? Well, undoubtedly one of the things that made Indonesian so successful as a national language so quickly was it simplicity? If you've seen my video on molay than you're already familiar with the simplicity of Indonesian because in its standard form it's very close to standard Malai just with some different vocabulary. Here are some features of Indonesian Indonesian has simple phonology. Orthography in general, one letter represents just one cell. Indonesian has simple Svo sentence structure. There are no case inflections in Indonesian, there is also no grammatical, gender and Indonesian. There's no plural form and Indonesian and explicit plurals are made duplications. Reduplicate, meaning that you repeat the word again and perhaps best of all, no verb conjugations. Let's look at a few Indonesian sentences and we'll identify some of those features. Sure.

Speaker 1:          05:32          This sentence means they are cooking eggs for breakfast, word for word it. They now cooked egg for breakfast. We can see that this sentence is Svo. As I said before, there are no verb conjugations, so how do we know that this action is happening now? Well, it's because of this word right here. Sit down. This is an adverb that indicates that something is happening right now. You can change the tense of the verb by changing this adverb. Here's another sentence, but it goes to the after changing the word sit down to Suda. The sentence now means they cooked eggs for breakfast in the past tense. The adverb Suda means something like already and shows that an action has been completed. How about the future tense, but it got kind of a must have to lose here. ICON is the future adverb. Another example, separate. Discerning, Bulibar, Colombo.

Speaker 1:          06:20          This means like me, he often travels to loan book word for word. It's like I. He often traveled to loan book. Another example of Tacoma Mall. Do this means do you want to sit up up is a yes or a no question marker, so word for word it's question you want sit, but up as often left out in speech and notice that to express desire. You can just add my own right before another verb. The second verb doesn't change its form at all. Another example, Siama newly. This means I write letters for my friend word for word. It's I write a letter for friend. I noticed that the word for letters Sudip is the same as the singular form. Also noticed that possession is shown by placing a personal pronoun right after announcing to Mon Cya. Literally friend. I means my friend. This makes it quite easy to form possessives.

Speaker 1:          07:14          Another example. Scientists who come down. This means, I don't like eating peanuts word for word. It's, I know like eat peanut, so we negate a sentence by adding t dot before the verb, and notice that similar to the word mouth, which means once we can express like by placing the word Sukar right before another verb got Joan Suda. This means the peanuts have already been eaten word by word. It's peanuts already be eaten. The icon is a passive. Let's take a look at some of the verbs from the above sentences. You can see that these Indonesian verbs have two parts of root in black and an ethics in red Indonesian has many such affixes that are added to routes to make verbs and nouns. One example, the root Dooley's meaning to right, we have to write the two lists to be written that the police to be written to listen, something that's written when normally scan to write something down, but no lease a writer, but no listen the process of writing, but at the least to have written on it, but the lesson with the writing or words, you can see more examples of such affixes in my video on Malave, which functions in the same way affix is of the most challenging part of learning Indonesian, at least for a lot of learners, but you can make use of that feature of the roots and affixes to help you learn new words through their connections with other words.

Speaker 1:          08:35          Standard Indonesian really is a simple language compared to other languages, but that's standard Indonesia, which is normally used as the written language and informal context. The Way Indonesian is spoken in daily life is often fairly different from standard Indonesian, different varieties of colloquial Indonesian or spoken around the country and they're influenced by the local native language that area, these different varieties of Indonesian or referred to as Bahasa gold. The Bahasa goal of Jakarta is influenced by Battelle. We the Malay Creole language that's native to Jakarta as well as by Javanese and Sudanese. Since people from all over Indonesia moved to Jakarta. Let's look at the Bahasa gavel of Jakarta and see how it differs from standard Indonesian. Here's a sentence we looked at before my name now in Bahasa gold medal.

Speaker 1:          09:23          The first difference we see is that the word sit down, which indicates present tense is like in Bahasa gold. Luggy is also used in standard Indonesian to me and again or still, but it's not used as a present tense marker like this. Another difference is that the verb is used in its root form muscle without the prefix. Then we have a sound difference in the world to Lord, which becomes like to lower and then took becomes bulla which can be used in standard Indonesian, but the meaning is more like in order to in Bahasa got well you can use it to simply mean for, but it got sued. Now in Bahasa goal, but a code here, notice that the word pseudo is reduced to Buddha, but got now in Bahasa gold may come back and here, notice that the future marker icon becomes buckle. Another example, separate these setting now in Bahasa.

Speaker 1:          10:19          Goal yet gooey. Yes, setting, reboot and Colombo. The first difference here is that the word solidity, meaning like changes to Kayak. Then notice that sale becomes Gui, which is a lone word from battalion in beverly becomes the boot on the root is the same, but the graphics are different. Do in this example, we'll see two variations of Bahasa gold. The first variation is a simple casual sentence going to duke that notice that the yes or no question marker isn't there. Instead at the end you see God, which means no in Bahasa Dell, so it's like you want to sit. No. The second variation is used for close friends or people the same age as you are younger. Lumada, loopnet. The second person Pronoun is loop, which I believe is a lone word from Chinese, which is present in the battalion we creole language of Jakarta. In this example, let's look at some options for first person pronouns.

Speaker 1:          11:11          Siama men who weren't really suited what the manway in a casual, polite sentence you use, even in Bahasa gold in a more casual, familiar sentence, aclu is used, and when who is used as a possessive, a shortened form is attached to the end of the Nell in a more intimate sentence, grew up or way is used, also noticed that monopolies loses its prefix, but it doesn't revert to its root form to lease. Instead, it maintains the nasal sound at the beginning. One more small difference we can see is that the word for friend to mine is pronounced more like two men and another example. Scientists who come now in Bahasa gold item and Kutchan again, here we see the pronouns blew up and we see that the negative to that becomes now, which is related to the word God, which we saw before, and in Bahasa, golden Sukkah sometimes becomes the men.

Speaker 1:          12:07          And one last example. Now in Bahasa goal here, the only difference is that [inaudible] becomes Buddha as we saw before. So you can see that the colloquial Indonesia Jakarta is fairly different from standard Indonesia and there are varieties like this spoken around the country, the influence of the other languages of Indonesia on colloquial Indonesia is one of the things that sets the language apart from other varieties of Malaysian Indonesian is definitely a fun language to study and communicating with Indonesians in their national language and Lingua Franca is an amazing experience. The question of the day for Indonesians, to what extent do you speak standard Indonesia and to what extent do you speak Bahasa goal and in what situations? Leave your comments down below and for learners of Indonesian, what's been your experience communicating with Indonesian people? Do you find the standard Indonesian that you learn at textbooks to be useful or do you feel like you should be learning more of the language as it's really spoken? Be sure to follow link focus on facebook, twitter and instagram. And again, I'd like to say thank you very much to my patrion supporters, especially the ones right here on the screen for their monthly pledges. Thank you very much and have a nice day.
