Speaker 1:          00:00          Hello everyone, welcome to the Lange Focus Channel and my name is Paul. Today's topic is the Java language as Spanish creole. In fact, the only Spanish based Creole language in Asia. The name of the language comes from the Spanish word Shabacado, meaning vulgar or in poor taste. That's because [inaudible] was originally considered incorrect or corrupted. Spanish Java Condo is spoken in the Philippines and as a direct result of the Philippines history as a Spanish colony. It's not spoken by the majority of Filipinos, but by a minority living in specific areas. It spoken in different varieties in Cavita, a province just south of Metro Manila in Cotabato on the island of Mindanao, Basilan island to the south of Mindanao, and it's spoken by the largest number of speakers in Zamboanga, especially in Zamboanga City on Mindanao. It's notoriously difficult to find consistent statistics about the number of Java speakers, but according to the United Nations statistics division in 2005, there were 431,000 native speakers, including around 311,000 in Zamboanga.

Speaker 1:          01:08          But those numbers underestimate the number of people who speak Java. Condo zone belonged to a city, a city with over a million people is a very diverse place with migrants from all over the Philippines and Java. Camo serves as the most common Lingua Franca. So hundreds of thousands more people speak it as a second or third language. So what is it exactly? Is it Spanish? Well, not exactly. It's a Spanish based creole, meaning that Spanish is the lexus fire language, the language that supplied most of the vocabulary while the grammar is largely based on Filipino languages, like the science to catalog and guy known the Spanish colonial period. And the Philippines began in 15, 21 and beginning in 15, 65, the Philippine islands began to be administered from the vice royalty of new Spain, which was based in Mexico City. This continued until Mexico's independence in 18, 21 after which the Philippines were administered directly by Spain, but for those 256 years, Philippines had significant interaction with new Spain and it's people during this time, the Philippines and new Spain.

Speaker 1:          02:09          We're connected by the galleon trade, large trading ship voyages that made the journey between Manila Acapulco once or twice a year. This brought Filipinos in contact with Spanish speaking workers from new Spain while soldiers and settlers from Spain were present. Soldiers and settlers from new span also arrived in significant numbers. One place where many newcomers settled wasn't assemble under which the Spanish seized in 16, 35 in an attempt to stop attacks by morrow pirates, they established a fortress called at a Alpharetta. They San Jose Royal Court of St Joseph. The population of this fort had a direct impact on the development of the avocado spoken in Zamboanga. There were Visayan warriors from say boo and other areas, Spanish soldiers, including those from Spain, Mexico, as well as Peru and Jesuit priests who served Spanish translators and might have taught the others how to communicate, resulting in a pigeon language that would become the travel condo creole.

Speaker 1:          03:07          This fort was eventually abandoned, but some of the population remained and continued to interact with locals while the Jesuit priests continued their conversion efforts. This both spread Java condo and brought additional influences to the language making it a little more Filipino and a little less Spanish. This is the kind of contact that resulted in the creation of other forms of Java condo as well, but the exact influences were somewhat different. For example, the Java condo spoken and covey tape has more Castilian, Spanish influence and less Mexican Spanish influence and has more Tagalog influence rather than be cited. Now let's look at some features of avocado and see how it differs from Spanish. I'm focusing mainly on Zumba on Daniel, that Java condo creole spoken in Zamboanga. We'll start by focusing on the syntax and I'll introduce additional elements as we go. While Spanish is generally Svo, Java, Camo is generally vso like Tagalo or resign.

Speaker 1:          04:02          Here's the sentence, meaning the men looked at Jose in Spanish in middle, and in Java, O'connell in Spanish, the subject alone comes first, but in Java condo it comes after the verb. There are some other important things we can notice about the sentence. The verb, middle from Merdod means look in Spanish, while in Java it means both look and see, so depending on the intended meaning, the Spanish translation might be elluminate br plus a using a different verb to mean. See, also notice that the verb forms are slightly different. The Spanish verb is conjugated for the third person, singular conjugation in the Predator it or past historic tents, but Java Kennel verbs are conjugated at all. The verb. Madonna will be the same for any subject. The only thing that can change is this extra little piece right here, which is a proverb that shows tents.

Speaker 1:          04:59          Yeah, indicates past top, indicates present, and I indicates future. These are not always used but can be used for clarity and for emphasis. Also, notice that Java condo uses Khan instead of our column, comes from the Spanish word con, meaning with, but in Java Kunle it's used as the object or accusative marker, so already we can see a number of differences between Spanish and Chava condo. Another example, here's a sentence, meaning you teach children, you being the plural form. In Spanish, we'll status and Nina's and in Java connell the insignia that again in Spanish, the subject comes first and the Java condo. It comes after the verb and you'll notice the present tense verb, top before the verb now is a locomotive particle or preposition which shows direction or location. Apparently it comes from a historian and note the difference in vocabulary for the words meaning children in Java Kunle, you'll see the phrase Monga Manga is a plural marker found in Tagalo, Visayan and Haley Guy Known in Java candle.

Speaker 1:          06:05          This is sometimes used as the plural marker and the Spanish plural form with s or s is sometimes used. Another example. Here's the sentence, meaning I love you in Spanish or the ammo and the Java Kunle on my ego or that my yield, but indego this time, the Spanish sentence is Sov, not Svo, because when the object is a pronoun, it usually comes before the verb, but in Spanish, the subject pronouns can be dropped because the person in number are clear from the conjugation of the verb. In Java, however, verbs are conjugated, so the subject Pronoun is necessary and notice that the top is optional. Earlier we saw that cone meaning with in Spanish is used as the object marker in Java candle here, Contigo, which means with you in Spanish, is used as the object Pronoun. All of the subject pronouns of Spanish origin have an object pronoun equivalent like this that begins with colon.

Speaker 1:          07:02          There are other subject pronouns of Filipino origin and their corresponding object. Pronouns are also a Filipino origin. Some pronouns might come from Filipino languages because they communicate something that the Spanish pronouns couldn't communicate. Notice, for example, the first person, plural pronouns come in and Kita, which come from Visayan, some Austronesian languages, including some languages of the Philippines. Distinguished between the first person, plural, inclusive of the listener and exclusive of the listener. Another example, here's a sentence, meaning this is Pablo. In Spanish, it's the low and in Java candle again, in Spanish, the subject comes first. It's the demonstrative Pronoun. Sdi. In Chicago it comes after the predicate and you can see that the pronoun is abbreviated, but it's not always so there's actually no verb in this sentence because Java condo has no copy Copula, so the word order is really predicate subject. The word see is a subject marker for personal names, which is also found in Tagalog and healy, guy known in Spanish.

Speaker 1:          08:05          Demonstrative pronouns have gender, but Java cundall has no grammatical gender. So for a female name in Spanish it would be like this is that is Trisha with a change in the pronouns. While then Sheva Condo, it would be this with no change in the Pronoun and other elements of the world order that is different is that adjectives come before nouns. In Java candle, not after. In Spanish we have limited meaning free time, and in Java we have another sentence. Here's the sentence, meaning I love their house in Spanish, you almost, and in Java Kunle again, notice that in the Spanish sentence you can drop the subject, but in Java condo you can't. The third person, plural, possessive pronoun in Java is de la. The possessive pronouns typically consist of d prefix to the beginning of the Spanish subject, pronouns, or to Filipino clinic pronouns. Another sentence, here's the sentence, meaning Helena or Jane bought a second dog in Spanish.

Speaker 1:          09:10          Why not? And in Java one pro one, you've got those battle. Again, we see the SVO versus vsl. We see the subject Marker C and a pre verb in Java Condo, and we see the word for dog. There's one new thing to notice here. The ordinal numbers in Spanish is Segundo, but in Java condo it's eco dose. The cardinal numbers of Java Convo, like those are all basically the same as in Spanish, but with slightly different spelling, but while Spanish has different forms for ordinal numbers, Shavano, prefixes, eco to cardinal numbers, notice that the Spanish ordinal number pretty metal is used, and other Spanish ones can be used in place of the Cheva Council forums to say, good window for example. Now let's look at a couple more sentences and see what we find. Here's the sentence, meaning the book will be published in five languages in Spanish and thinker, the almost word for word, it's the book will be published in five languages, and in Java Kunle word for word, it's the book verbal prefix come out in five language.

Speaker 1:          10:21          In this sentence, we see that the subject comes first in both sentences, in Java, Connell, Svo, word order is possible. For example, it's often found a new stories that are translated from Spanish media keeping the text as similar to the Spanish version as possible. Another thing is that in Chicago there's no passive form, so passive meaning is understood from context or the action can be paraphrased in Spanish. The sentence is explicitly future, but the traveler Kennel sentence doesn't have the future Prevar I it can have it, but here it doesn't. We see here that the verb is proceeded by mom. Mom is a prefix that makes a verb distributive, meaning that the action is performed by several subjects or on several objects separately. Here, the book will be released separately five different times in five different versions, so money is used to show the distribution of the action among the different releases of the book.

Speaker 1:          11:14          Mine is also a prefix that can be attached to nouns and English loan words to turn them into travel. Kennel verbs, Mung translate, Mon Picnic, Monroe reply, etc. There's a similar prefix mug into kellogg and visayan and notice that the word for languages in spanish is easy omas, while in java condo it's lingala. Hey, in java, connell, and oTher languages of the Philippines, lingua here is used to refer to languages that are spoken by communities of people while in spanish language refers more to the general concept of language, so to refer to a specific human language and spanish. Mom is the typical word and one last sentence. This sentence means they left without paying for the drink in spanish, so if we don't have either word for word, it's reflexive particle. They went without pay the drink in java. Candle light, but gobbled nana word for word.

Speaker 1:          12:12          It's past tense. Pre-verbal leave. They without pay object marker. Definite article, alcoholic drink. This last sentence is fairly different from it. Spanish equivalent first, notice that the verbs are different. in spanish, we see the reflexive form of the verb. Eod meaning to go. The reflexive form is used to mean leave. Java. Camo doesn't have this construction, so another verb has used. Instead it's a derivative of the spanish word, salyer meaning to go out. See, la is the third person plural, subject pronouns, which comes from tagalog and visayan. Hawaii is a negative pre verb for the past tense. Cornell is a combination of con, the object marKer plus l, the definite article. Finally we have the word tomato, which means alcoholic drink in java candle. Well, in spanish it's maybe the java candle also has a similar word baby, but that is a general word for a drink, not specifically an alcoholic drink.

Speaker 1:          13:06          Before I mentioned that java was influenced by mexican spanish, there was undoubtedly some influence on the pronunciation of mcconnell in travel. Kennel also contains some vocabulary that clearly came from mexican spanish, for example, psychotic meaning grass. This is originally a word from now what to an indigenous language of Mexico. It entered mexican spanish as a lone word and then entered jaVa kennel via mexican spanish. These words are also from now what'll John Gay meaning market which comes from young gay jungle, meaning monkey from jungle and commentate meaning sweet potato. There were other words and expressions that don't come from the wattle words, but are common to Mexico and maybe have special usage in Mexico. In Mexico, when you want someone to repeat something because you didn't catch what they said, you ask monday. This is also used in java o'connell. I also hear that a lot of swear words or of specifically mexican origin, but I'll skip those for now.

Speaker 1:          14:04          So our avocado and spanish mutually intelligible, well, yes and no. Some java speakers have told me that they can understand around 60 percent or more of certain varietieS of spanish in particular european, spanish and mexican spanish, but this is not necessarily true fOr spanish speakers who here java o'connell, while most java connell speakers are familiar with the word order of english and maybe the word order of spanish itself. Spanish speakers are generally not familiar with the word order of filipino languages like tagalog or scion, so when they hear cheva condo, they might just hear a mishmash of spanish words, but be confused by how they're being put together in sentences. This is especially true for informal travel condo which has more influence from filipino languages where as formal travel economy is closer to spanish, but probably with some basic exposure to the grammar, they could improve their comprehension of it quite quickly.

Speaker 1:          14:57          Some people argue that [inaudible] really isn't that different from other filipino languages like to gallo or scion, which contain a lot of spanish vocabulary themselves. Java condo just has a lot more of it. The question of the day for spanish speakers, how well can you understand java candle? I'll leave a link to a video in the description for you to see before commenting if you want, and for java speakers, how weLl can you understand spanish? Does it depend on the variety of spanish or on the context? Be sure to follow lang, focus on facebook, twitter, and instagram, especially instagram because it's the coolest, and once again, I'd like to say thank you to all of my patreon supporters, especially these ones right here on the screen who are my top tier patrion supporters. Many tHanks to them and to you. Thank you for watching and have a nice day.
