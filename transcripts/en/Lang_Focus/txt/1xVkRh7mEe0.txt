Speaker 2:          00:03          Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:04          Okay. So the most commonly spoken romance languages are of Spanish, Portuguese, French, Italian. Um, that was one more, what was it? Oh Micky. Stop that. What are you doing? Okay. Anyway, so the romance language just came from the Roman Empire, the languages of Rome. Um, what was it again? Oh, Mickey. Mickey, what are you doing? Give me that. Okay. Anyway, so what was it? Hello everyone. Welcome to the Lange Focus Channel and my name is Paul. Today's topic is the Romanian language or lean borrow mueller in Romanian. As you can see the word Romanian contains the word Roman in it. Why? Because it developed from the language of the Romans Latin to clarify Romanian as a member of the romance language family. When speaking of romance languages, Romanian tends to get overlooked and I'm guilty of that myself. Maybe it's because of its geographic isolation from the other romance languages.

Speaker 1:          01:10          You can see that the other major romance languages are all spoken in western Europe, but Romanian has spoken in eastern Europe and to separate it from the others by the Belkins and parts of central Europe, Romania and as part of the Eastern Romance Branch and there are other languages of this branch which are spoken by minorities throughout southeastern Europe. Notice that the names of these languages contain the word Romanian. These languages are all closely related to Romania. Sometimes the word Romania is used to refer to all of these closely related languages together and some eastern romance speakers consider them to be dialects of one language. The language of Romania and Moldova is sometimes referred to as Dayco Romania to distinguish between it and the others. Dayco Romanian has the largest number of speakers out of all of those languages by far and at this video I'm basically focusing on Dayco Romanian.

Speaker 1:          01:57          Romanian is spoken by a route 24 million native speakers and around 4000002nd language speakers. It is the official language of Romania where it is the mother tongue of around 93% of the people or around 18.6 million people as well as the official language of Moldova. We're at spoken by around 2.7 5 million people in Moldova. The language is referred to as muddle van by some people and as Romanian by others. Romanian is somewhat unique amongst the romance languages because it developed in close contact with other languages, mainly the Slavic languages which have influenced its pronunciation and vocabulary. The closest romance language to Romanian is reportedly Italian, which shares about 77% lexical similarity with Romanian. Compare that to 82% for Italian and Spanish or 89% for Italian and French history. The people living in the area before the arrival of the Romans were known as the dations or Dutchy and Romanian day.

Speaker 1:          02:54          Shell was conquered by the Roman military in one oh six ce and the population adopted the Latin language very quickly. Exactly what happened is not clear. Maybe the nation people simply adopted the Latin language of their conquerors, but it's also possible that the area was flooded with Roman settlers who intermarried with the local stations. There's also the theory that the nation language was already an Italian language, closely related to Latin. What is clear is that the area became very latinized. Very quickly. The Roman Empire withdrew its military from Daysha and two 71 to two 72 ce, but left behind a romanized Latin speaking population. The next few centuries are fairly mysterious, but the local dialects of Latin gradually evolved and sometime before the ninth century Prodo Romanian, the ancestor of Romanian and all the eastern Romance Languages, Oh rose, there are different opinions about whether protal Romanian developed from the vulgar Latin spoken by the romanized station population or from a variety of vulgar Latin spoken by people south of the Danube river, who later migrated to the North Slavic influence.

Speaker 1:          03:56          Notice again that Romanian is surrounded by mostly Slavic languages. That's because of the migration of Slavic speakers into the area. Between the seventh and ninth century CE contact with Slavic speakers had an influence on eastern romance, particularly in vocabulary and pronunciation but also in grammar and other areas. It's fucked that many Slavic speakers adopted the local romance dialect, but because it was their second language they spoke it with an accent and they continue to use certain Slavic words that felt natural for them to keep using. Old Church. Slavonic must have also had an influence on Romanian because it was the administrative language until the 16th century and the liturgical language until the 17th century. It's hard to know exactly how Romanian developed during the Middle Ages because there are no existing Romanian texts from before the 16th century. The earliest Romanian text is niac shoes letter, which dates to 1521 it was written with the Cyrillic alphabet which was used to write Romanian until the 19th century.

Speaker 1:          04:52          This is an obvious result of the Slavic influence on the language, the modern period. It's beyond the scope of this video to go into detail about the history of Romania and the governments that ruled over its different parts. What's important for us to remember is that despite changing borders and governments, there remained an ethnic and linguistic group that considered themselves Romanian with a growing sense of Romanian national identity efforts to standardize the Romanian language began in the 18th century. The first Romanian grammar was published in 1780 in the 18 hundreds Romanian linguists made a concerted effort to read Latin guys the language and remove Slavic and other influences from the language. And interestingly in replacing a lot of the non romance vocabulary, they drew words not only from Latin but also from Italian that especially from French, when Romania became an independent country in 1878 it's official language became Romanian.

Speaker 1:          05:46          It's borders changed several times during the 20th century, while Moldova spent much of the 20th century under Soviet rule as it gained independence, Moldova made Moldova in it's language. The consensus is that Romanian and Moldovan are a single language just with some regional variation. The standard written language is exactly the same for both Romanian and Moldovan. So how did this romance language survive in this area when most others didn't survive? Well, nobody really knows. But as I said before, the area known as Daysha became thoroughly latinized probably more than other areas in the region. So whereas in other areas, the Latin influence faded after the departure of the Roman empire in Daysha that Latin influenced did not fade. There are also various theories about the people fending off invaders better than others or that the geography of their land insulated them from being overrun that assimilated.

Speaker 1:          06:37          For example, some say that the Carpathian mountains provided a barrier for attack from the north and east or provided refuge and strategic high ground above invaders. But again, nobody really knows. So what is Romanian like? Well, since Romanian is a romance language that developed from Latin, it's obviously quite similar to French, Spanish, Italian, and other romance languages, but it's also been influenced by other languages, particularly at the Slavic language, just because of its position in the Balkan [inaudible] wound. The balkins prop wound is an area in which the various languages have mutually influenced each other, including romance languages, Slavic languages, Greek and Albanian. It has also been influenced by other nearby languages, like Hungarian vocabulary. The majority of Romanian vocabulary is of Latin and romance origin based on one study, 63% of Romanian vocabulary is romance, while 11.5% is slavic with other vocabulary coming from Turkish, Greek, Hungarian, and German. But if we focus on the most common 2,500 words in Romanian, the percentage of romance vocabulary is around 76% and slavic around 15% let's look at some sentences and examine their vocabulary. [inaudible] is [inaudible].

Speaker 1:          07:49          This means I know the history of Europe, very well word for word, it's I know history, the Europe's very well. All of these words are romance words. Cornell risk means I know or I'm familiar with and it's like Conosco in Italian or Juco ne in French you studier means history and it's like sturdier in Italian or east La. In French it would ropey means European and is like a, it will pale in Italian or google pay on in French four out of the day means very in Romanian and is related to the word meaning strong in Italian photo tay and in French fall. So here it means very and it's not used that way in Italian or French being the means, well like the Italian word Bennett and like the French word beyond another example, I'm spoiled, Machina, foot up probe limit and Fatah casy. This means I washed the car in front of the house without any problems.

Speaker 1:          08:44          Word for word, it's myself. I wash car, the without problems in face houses the means me or myself like me in Italian or in French it's the indirect object pronouns which is used here because the verbus reflexive but means wash in the first person singular. This word developed from vulgar Latin x bed Levada and it's like the Portuguese word pedal. Nevada meaning to wash machina means car and a similar to Makena in Italian and like Makina in Spanish which means machine or engine. Flooded means without and comes from Latin thought us like 40 in Italian which means outside put it all blemish is also a romance word coming from Latin [inaudible] which ultimately came from ancient Greek. It means in and comes from Latin and ultimately goes all the way back to Prodo, Indo European Fidessa I means face or front and comes from vulgar Latin.

Speaker 1:          09:44          Fuck Ya. It's similar to fuck in Italian and fuss and French. [inaudible] means house like Kazaa in Italian and Casa in Spanish. Another example today with the or prima does boil. This means we must stop the war word for word. It's must subjunctive stop war that Abe we means have to and as a slavic lone word comes from Latin C and at this sentence indicates the subjunctive mood or putting means stop and as a Slavic Lone word that does bullying means war and is also a slavic lone word. Many commonly used Romanian words are of Slavic origin. A few more examples are but yet then friend Iub to love Uplit d to Pay [inaudible] to wake up a go to see to find. So as you can see the majority of Romanian vocabulary is romance vocabulary but Slavic vocabulary is also quite evident. We'd order. The word order of Romanian is very similar to other romance languages with one particular difference that we'll notice. [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          10:50          is [inaudible], CONOSCO, Storia, [inaudible] Molto Bene. The keywords in these sentences are all in the same order. What's different is that the Romanian sentence has no standalone definite article or preposition for of that's because while other romance languages no longer have Cayston declensions for nouns and adjectives like Latin did, Romanian does have them. Well, it has three case declensions for announce languages that don't have case. Declensions often use prepositions instead to indicate the same information in the sentence it [inaudible] is in the genitive case, meaning of Europe or Europe's. The most basic form of the noun is actually [inaudible] with an a, but the eye at the end is a definite article and the he indicates genitive case because the genitive case indicates possession. We don't need a preposition meaning of like an Italian. As for the definite article in Romanian, it comes at the end of the word and works together with the case.

Speaker 1:          11:43          Declension in the word you sturdier the Aa shows that the word is definite. So we don't need a definite article before the word Noun cases. Let's look a noun in Romanian and see how it changes form depending on its case, meaning it's role in the sentence. The Noun is but a but which means man first in the singular indefinite nominative and accusative wound, but a buck genitive and dative Uber Bucks. Definite but a bottle, but a bottle and in the plural indefinite initiative, but a butts. Who Norbert Bucks? Definite. But Betsy. But Betsy Lord, here are a couple of examples of case declensions in context focusing on the word, but uh, but, but a bottle, all machinery. This sentence means the man bought a car word for word Ed's man has bought a car. The form of the word for the man, but about tool is in the nominative case because it's the subject.

Speaker 1:          12:42          So we use the definite declension for nominative case that we saw before. Another example. Blanchet my Sheena [inaudible]. This sentence means I like the man's car word for word, it's myself or to me like car, the man, the possessive, the form of the word for the man is in the genitive case because it's showing possession. So we use the definite declension for genitive data that we saw before the ul coming after the word, but a but represents the definite article. If the definite article is followed by Ui that indicates genitive or dative, but a but is a masculine. No Feminine Nouns and neuter nouns take different case declensions. Yes, Romanian has maintained neuter gender unlike the other romance languages. Let's look at one more Romanian sentence together and see what we notice. The ankles of amy [inaudible] up picnic. The sentence means due to the rainy weather, we couldn't go to the picnic word for word.

Speaker 1:          13:42          It's from cause weather rainy. No, we have could go to picnic. The is a contraction of debt plus in which both come from Latin cows is a romance word that was borrowed from French. Cozy that amy means weather and as a slavic lone word, it's a feminine now than the base form is that I may, but in this sentence it's in the date of case represented by this ending I plus the definite article I thrill USC means rainy and comes from Latin [inaudible]. This adjective is also declined to agree with the singular feminine date of case. Now the day me no means no and comes from Latin known, um, is the first person plural form of the verb for to have similar to another romance languages. Past actions can be expressed by using the auxiliary verb to have along with the past participle means could and it's the past participle of up with death which comes from Latin [inaudible] they saw together, um, and put to it, I mean could or were able to message.

Speaker 1:          14:47          It means go and comes from the Latin medidata meaning to dip or to plunge. But in Romania, Romanian it means to go. La is a preposition, meaning to and comes from the Latin you luck and picnic means picnic and comes from the French word picnic. If you speak a romance language or if you've ever studied a romance language, then you'll probably notice a lot of similarities with Romania, but you may have to look a little closer to notice those similarities. Romanian clearly developed in a somewhat different direction from other romance languages and even though it was re latinized, it still feels more slavic in some ways and the way words are articulated in the way words are formed and in some details of the grammar. That's what makes Romanian interesting and unique amongst the romance languages. It's development in geographic isolation from the others and it's contact with neighboring languages.

Speaker 1:          15:34          So the question of the day for speakers of Romanian, how similar to you think Romanian is to the other romance languages like Italian and for speakers of other romance languages. How similar or different to you think Romanian is from your language and what stands out to you as the biggest difference? Let us know in the comments down below.
