Speaker 2:          00:04          Hello everyone. Lang focus channel or your up. I want to talk about something called code switching. Gang goal cutie pie article. Though

Speaker 2:          00:15          some people are monolingual and speak just one language. Other people are bilingual or multilingual and speak more than one language. Bilingual or multilingual people sometimes switch back and forth between two or more different languages. This is called code switching. One situation in which code switching is common is within immigrant families. For example, let's imagine a Russian family moves from Russia to the United States and the children grow up speaking Russian as their native language, but they learned English outside of the home. When the children in that family speak to their siblings, they might code switch between Russian and English. Another situation in which code switching is common is in certain countries where a native language is spoken alongside a former colonial language. One example that comes to mind is in India where Hindi English code switching is Coleman and another example is in Philippines where Tagalog English code switching is Coleman.

Speaker 2:          01:07          You may have seen my earlier video on die glossier, which means switching between two different languages or two different forms of a language in different situations. For example, formal versus informal situations. Code switching is different in that people switch languages in a single situation within a single conversation and sometimes within a single sentence. Code switching is largely unpredictable and speakers often impulsively switch languages without any conscious choice in code switching one language is the dominant language. Normally the native language of the group, this is sometimes called the Matrix language and the additional language is called the embedded language. The Matrix language lays out the basis for the communication and then utterances from the additional language are embedded into the matrix language. There were various reasons that people might switch from their matrix language to an embedded language. Number one, directive function. People switch languages to either include or exclude other people from the conversation.

Speaker 2:          02:03          Maybe you want to tell secrets, so you switched to a language that the people around you don't understand or maybe the opposite. Maybe you want to end a private conversation and reengage with the people around you, so you switched to a language that they do understand. Number two, expressive function. People include the embedded language in order to express some part of their identity. For example, they want to show their connection to a certain country or culture, and in some cases it might be an expression of status through association with the prestigious outgroup. Number three referential function. Someone who is unable to express an idea easily in one language switches to the other language in order to express it more easily. This seems to be very common among bilingual children in immigrant families. Number four, phatic function. Sometimes a speaker switches languages or repeat something in both languages in order to emphasize it.

Speaker 2:          02:50          Number five, metal linguistic function. This is reporting something in the other language or commenting on something said in the other language. For example, you're speaking in Japanese, but then you quote a lyric from an English language song without translating it. Maybe you'll say something in the embedded language, but then you explain it or add further commentary in the Matrix language. Number six poetic function. The speaker says certain words or mixed jokes in the embedded language for amusement or for some kind of artistic purpose. Code switching takes a few different forms. Here are some of the main ones. Number one inter sentential switching in which the language switches for entire sentences or clauses. For example, a bilingual Spanish English speaker says, sometimes I'll start a sentence in English. He tell him, you know, and a spaniel. Number two, interest sentential switching in which the speaker switches languages within the clause or sentence boundaries.

Speaker 2:          03:38          Here's an example from a bilingual English Portuguese speakers speech. I don't know, may you Luca [inaudible] window. This means I don't know my place in this world. Number three extra sentential or tag switching. A tag from one language is inserted into an utterance in another language. For example, a bilingual English Japanese speaker might say it's a good movie. They show meaning it's a good movie, right? Let's look at a couple of cases of code switching. The first one is from the Indian movie, the three idiots. The Matrix language is Hindi and the embedded language is English. The background to this scene is that the director of a university is welcoming the incoming freshmen students.

Speaker 3:          04:19          Hi John Lott.

Speaker 2:          04:29          Now let's take a look at the sentence we just heard the sentence means don't forget, I see he receives 400,000 applications a year and of those only 200 are selected you. The first clause of this sentence, don't forget it's an English. This is interesting potential code switching because the switching occurs at the clause boundary. This is probably done to draw attention to the phrase which is the phatic function. Applications is also an English switching within the clause or sentence boundaries. I suspect that this words in English because it's referring to college applications and words related to academic affairs are probably said very frequently in English select is also an English. This is interest sentential switching again, the speaker or the script writers probably chose to say this word in English in order to emphasize the importance of this action of selecting the freshmen students and of course you as an English.

Speaker 2:          05:22          This is interesting essential because it occurs at the clause boundary. This word was probably set apart and set an English in order to emphasize the selection of these particular students. So again, that's the phatic function in general. The speaker in this scene might be using English because he's the director of a university, and English is seen as an integral part of academic life. Let's look at a second example. This time from the Filipino movie, My baby love. Now, the background to the scene is that the young woman's father and the young man's aunts have started dating each other. Let's take a look at the whole scene first.

Speaker 3:          05:55          That long

Speaker 4:          06:01          mopping, personal libre, excusing [inaudible] mommy go. We'll be in [inaudible]. So I'm people in it. Well, my smug under, I'm Mamiko spill my smog under. I want me to go find him. And besides, I always didn't want to [inaudible] if that's what you wanted to hear, the good, at least we have leading something. I have to go now by now. I go by

Speaker 2:          06:41          now. Let's look at a few parts of that scene again and break them down.

Speaker 4:          06:46          So [inaudible] that month course not mopping personal and elaborate me. [inaudible] Mommy Mamiko

Speaker 2:          06:58          can we see interest sentential switching with English phrases embedded into a tagalog sentence in her reply, I think the woman's switches to English to emphasize certain points. The main message of a reply that her mother is beautiful isn't Tagalog, but this is an emotional conversation. And the English phrases draw attention to how she's feeling.

Speaker 4:          07:18          So I don't even give, if it'll be in suicide, we're going down one week or so. I'm people in it. Well, my smog and dot Emami go

Speaker 2:          07:32          here. We see extra sentential switching or tag switching the interjection, well as an English, but the rest of the sentences.
