Speaker 1:          00:00          Hello everyone, welcome to the lange focus channel. Uh, my name is Paul. Today's video is the second installment in the series mystery languages. If you haven't seen the first video in the mystery language, a series, you can check it out right here, but basically this is how it works. I will play you an audio sample of a language and then I'll show you a visual samples of the language and it's written for them and you can guess what language it is, but whether you guessed correctly or not, that doesn't matter. The important thing is that you leave your guesses and the reasons for your guesses in the comments down below and that will spark some interesting discussion. So let's get right into the first language. Please listen,

Speaker 2:          00:36          I'm bidding in a pile in the middle one upon which enabled me to pronounce away Nomia Sheila. I'm a building and some peanut volcker to Monica, but the upper market but Lukla bond. Okay. Lions are going to.

Speaker 1:          00:55          Now let's have a look at a few written samples of that same language.

Speaker 3:          01:00          Nema, Nina Harland. Cool. But don't they?

Speaker 1:          01:07          So what language do you think it is?

Speaker 1:          01:13          The language is a language spoken on the island of Cebu in the Philippines. If you guessed together, log or Filipino, which is the official language which is based on Tagalog, then that's a pretty good guests because to Gallaghan Silvano are closely related languages I've studied together. Again, I'm fairly familiar with it and when I look at Sidwell I know sometimes I don't know if I'm looking at Tagalog with lots of vocabulary, I don't know or whether I'm looking at say Bono said we wanna was sometimes referred to as Bisiah, which is actually a group of closely related languages that are spoken in the Visayas region in the Philippines, but some people like to refer to all the languages as a single language with different dialects and that's because all the Bisiah languages are quite closely related. But also because. Well there's power in numbers. You may have noticed the Spanish vocabulary in the sample sentences. That's because it has lots of Spanish long words just like to Gallo does in fact several one or has even more Spanish words meant together. Okay. Onto the second language, please listen.

Speaker 4:          02:11          They get food when he's sad, her warm up so they can meet, meet and whole manual, mundane, poem. They put handcuffs, put him to hold still

Speaker 1:          02:30          and again. Let's have a look at some written samples.

Speaker 5:          02:36          Yeah, I guess

Speaker 1:          02:41          so. What language is it?

Speaker 1:          02:46          It's the loud language. Lao is a language spoken in the Southeast Asian nation of Laos. It's a member of the Tai Chi language family, which is spoken in some parts of Southeast Asia, southern China and northern India. If you thought the language was tied then you were very close because ty and Lao, or very closely related to a large degree, they are mutually intelligible. They are both tonal languages, but one notable differences that ty has five tones. While Lau has six tones, they're also written in a slightly different script, but the scripts themselves are also closely related and if you can read one than reading the others shouldn't be too hard. Some of you may have noticed the tones and the language samples which make the language sound kind of melodic, and you might have guessed one of the Chinese languages like Mandarin or Cantonese, and those guesses would make sense because those are tonal languages. Just like lawand tire. Okay. Onto the third language, please listen.

Speaker 6:          03:37          Modify on central park. Young Scheme will mix as a club Dj Vika Outta the shop does issue three, Dan

Speaker 1:          03:57          and again, let's see a bit of the language visually.

Speaker 7:          04:00          Schools that Cmo, oh, seemed more Zune genito Dr. departure,

Speaker 1:          04:10          so what language is it? It's the Romanian language. If you speak any romance languages that you've probably noticed right away that there was a lot of romance vocabulary in the samples, what the pronunciation might have seemed kind of unusual to you. That's because Romanian is a romance language with some Slavic influence. That influence affects the pronunciation and also the vocabulary of the language. You may have also noticed the little glyphs above the letter a and below the letter t those glyphs or actually an integral part of those letters and those letters along with this, this, and this. Give you a quick hint that you're looking at Romanian and not at a different romance language. Romanian is spoken in Romania and Moldova and is geographically isolated from the other major romance languages. The Slavic influence on the language makes it distinct from the other romance languages, but Romanian is also said to be the closest romance language to the original Latin in grammar.

Speaker 1:          05:01          That's probably true, but in some other areas like phonology, it may not be as close to the original Latin as say Italian. Well, I hope you enjoyed guessing today's mystery languages. Leave your guesses and your reasons in the comments down below and also letting me know if you like the series and you think I should continue doing it.
