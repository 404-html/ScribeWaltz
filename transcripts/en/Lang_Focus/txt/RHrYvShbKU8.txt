Speaker 1:          00:00          Back by not so popular demand meaning about one third of my viewers love these videos and the other two thirds are like, it's another episode of mystery languages. I will give you some samples of a language and you have to guess what language it is. You might not be able to get the exact language, but maybe you'll be able to guess the language family or the region or country where that language is spoken or something like that. Just try to see how close you can get language number one, please listen.

Speaker 2:          00:30          Sherry did see a movie. I did some despite the rotarians. Yeah I do my lesson but even this one more to me hit me. She Rung, we lead poison. Nobody can witness. She should go going back. Yaba [inaudible] and you know, cause he, I did some Misha here wasn't, it was cynical about very,

Speaker 1:          01:03          now let's see a written sample of that language. So what language do you think it is?

Speaker 1:          01:27          The language is Yoruba. Yoruba is a member of the Niger Congo language family and is spoken in the west African countries of Nigeria and Beneen as well as Togo. It's an official language in Nigeria and to spoken by an estimated 30 million people. Current estimates are based on population growth since 1990 when 18 million people spoke it as a native language. It's also the most widely spoken African language outside of Africa, spoken by migrants around the world, and that's excluding Arabic, which is not considered a native language of Africa. You'll robot is primarily the language of the Yoruba people, but not all Yoruba people speak the euro by language. Yoruba is a tonal language and each syllable has one of three tones, high, mid, or low. And as I understand it, you can hear these three tones in the name of the language, which is pronounced Yoda with a mid, low and high tone. I probably just slaughtered that pronunciation, but you get the idea. There are three tones. Another feature to notice is that Yoruba syllables consist of a vowel, a consonant, followed by a vowel or a nasal sound that functions as its own syllable. There are no consonant clusters, and in that regard, it's similar to Japanese. All right, let's look at another language. Please listen.

Speaker 3:          02:40          [inaudible] oh this. Oh, [inaudible] [inaudible] know sending it. You go tubing in a Nigga Ya Kay up in the head on the hen to it.

Speaker 1:          03:13          Now let's see a written sample of this language now. What language do you think it is?

Speaker 1:          03:38          The language is Navajo. Navajo is a member of the southern branch of the Athabaskan language family. It's one of the most widely spoken native American languages with around 170,000 native speakers, most of whom are bilingual and speak English as well. The area where Navajo is spoken is in the southwestern United States, principally in Arizona, but also across the state borders in New Mexico and Utah. Navajo is a tonal language with four tones. Hi Lo rising and falling. It has a large inventory of consonant sounds. One example is a distinction between plan stops and fricatives and labial stops and fricking tips. For example, there's the plane stop cut and there's the labor. You'll stop quit. The difference is that the labial sounds include the rounding of the lips. Another example is and whoa and end, whoa, these two sounds are sounds not used in English, and then we have the labial sounds as well. Those are just a few of the many sounds of Navajo. Okay. Time for the next language.

Speaker 5:          05:19          Okay.

Speaker 1:          05:22          All right. What language do you think it is?

Speaker 1:          05:28          It's the Hungarian language. Hungarian is spoken by around 15 million people. Most of them in Hungary, in central Europe, but some live in neighboring Romania as well as other nearby countries like Slovakia, Slovenia, Austria, Serbia, Croatia, and Ukraine. Hungarian is not an Indo European language. It's a member of the eugric branch of the erotic language family. One notable feature of Hungarian is that there are lots of germinated consonants, germinated, meaning long consonants that are held longer than a short consonant. These are represented in writing by double letters in the audio sample. You can hear this if you pay attention for a little pauses when the consonants are linkedin. Another notable feature is palatalized consonants such as Chia. Yeah, and yeah, and overly simple way of describing these sounds is to say that they sounded like the consonant followed by a year sound. I hope you liked this episode of mystery languages.
