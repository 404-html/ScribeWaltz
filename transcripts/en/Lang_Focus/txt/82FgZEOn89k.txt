Speaker 1:          00:00          Today, I think I'll compare Portuguese with a special dialect of Portuguese called Spanish.

Speaker 1:          00:14          Hello everyone. Welcome to the Lange Focus Channel and my name is Paul. Today's topic is how similar or Spanish and Portuguese, as you probably know, Spanish and Portuguese are both Ibero Romance languages that share a common origin. There are different enough that they are definitely considered different languages, but they're also closely related and quite similar in many ways. On paper, the two languages look very similar and speakers of either language can generally read the other language without too much trouble. The spoken language is however, are more different from each other and less mutually intelligible than the written forms and Portuguese speakers typically understand spoken Spanish better than Spanish speakers understand Portuguese.

Speaker 1:          00:58          Well actually it's mostly because of the difference in pronunciation between the two languages, but we'll get into that a little later. Spanish and Portuguese share about 89% lexical similarity, meaning that 89% of the words have a cognate or an equivalent in the other language. Now, that doesn't always mean that 89% of the words will be the same because some of the different words are very basic and common words. And even though cognit words often look and sound quite similar, there are other cognates that have developed quite differently and now sound and look quite different. For instance, this pair of cognates clearly resemble each other in Spanish moondogs and in Portuguese and these words mean earth or world. Now here's a less obvious pair of cognates in Spanish and in Portuguese. By these words mean fish, it's and you can see the connection but it's not quite so obvious.

Speaker 1:          01:49          There are some very common everyday words that are different in the two languages. For example, in Spanish there's European, so from the verb Ben Sasse and Yo could ale from the verb gath which both mean I think these words have cognates in Portuguese, but it's also very common to say it wash from the verb is Sean. There is a Spanish cognitive, this word I yet, but it only means to find, not to think in Spanish. There's the verb meet APP meaning to look at or to watch. In Portuguese. The common verbiage is we'll learn. There is a Portuguese verb meelod but it's not commonly used. Personal pronouns. The personal pronouns in the two languages are generally similar but with slightly different forms. For example, Yo ill, no sutras, no rush, but also the formal way of saying you is normally different. In Spanish it's we'll stead in Portuguese there's a word velocity but instead people generally say [inaudible] and [inaudible] which is like saying sir or Madam.

Speaker 1:          02:56          These are equivalents of you and Senorita in Spanish, but in Spanish they're not used as pronouns. False friends. You will constantly encounter cognates in Spanish and Portuguese, but you'll also encounter lots of false friends. Words that look and sound the same and might share a common origin but they're meaning is actually different and some of these could potentially cause some crazy misunderstandings billado. In Spanish it means skinned or appealed, but colloquially it also means someone with a shaved head or a new haircut glove. In Portuguese, it has the same basic meaning of skinned or peeled, but in Brazilian Portuguese it also means naked. In Portuguese, the word for octopus is both in Spanish, the word for octopus is blue book and buttered will means dust, but it also means something sexual and kids don't google it. In Spanish. [inaudible] means a delicious dinner. In Portuguese, [inaudible] means a weird scene.

Speaker 1:          03:58          And Center is also a slang word for thing. So this could mean a weird thing. It'll be now in Spanish means tip like a tip for a waiter. [inaudible] means tuition fees like for university and in Brazilian Portuguese it means bribe. So even though lots of words are pretty much the same in either language, it might be a little dangerous to assume that they mean the same thing. Pronunciation. The main reason that the spoken forms of the two languages are less intelligible than the written forms is because they differ significantly in phonology. Portuguese has much more complex phonology than Spanish with many extra sounds, and this is one reason that Portuguese speakers have an easier time understanding spoken Spanish. Then vice versa. Consonants in Spanish. The B, D and g consonants have soft pronunciations that occur, for example, between vowels. The way those soft sounds work is different.

Speaker 1:          04:51          In Portuguese, European, Portuguese has the soft d sound, while some Brazilian accents don't. For example, in Spanish, Nether in Portuguese mother and in Brazilian Portuguese, Portuguese doesn't have the soft be in Spanish in Portuguese, severe. Next, the rolled our sound of Spanish corresponds to a rather different sound in Portuguese when it's at the beginning of a word or if it's doubled in Spanish. Could that be though in Portuguese? Xapi in Spanish, in Portuguese too. Next, the sound represented by a double l in Spanish has a corresponding sound in Portuguese represented by l h for example. In Spanish there's and in Portuguese there's phenomenal meaning fail and Portuguese has some consonants that don't have an equivalent in Spanish. First a shutter sound, it's spelled with c h or with x, so in Spanish we have yellow, but in Portuguese chigga meaning arrives [inaudible] sound. In Spanish we have, I couldn't see it, and in Portuguese we have as you can see it.

Speaker 1:          06:03          This is another example of a difference in soft consonants. In both languages. The letter g represents a soft g sound rather than a go when it's followed by an e or an I. But the soft sound is different in either language. Listen, again, I can see here there's this year next a va sound Spanish doesn't really have a v sound. It does have the soft be, which kind of sounds similar to a v, but Portuguese has a distinct v sound. So in Spanish we have BC and in Portuguese we have visitor. In Spanish we have Leonardo, and in Portuguese we have leave and one more a z sound. The sound is not found in many Spanish words, but in Portuguese it's very common. So in Spanish we have, but at Csun and in Portuguese we have pcs. This sound is often found between vowels and at the beginning of words, vowels.

Speaker 1:          07:00          There are quite a few more vowel sounds in Portuguese than there are in Spanish. Spanish has five pure vowels. While Portuguese has all of those plus seven additional ones. Spanish has just one e sound, which sounds like a Portuguese has this and an additional one like the f inset in Portuguese. It's difficult to predict which one to use in any given word. But these ones are different in Spanish, in Portuguese mirror, but these ones are the same in Spanish Messa and in Portuguese Miza. When a word has the diphthong ea in Spanish, it usually corresponds to an open e in Portuguese for example, in Spanish. See it there. And in Portuguese said Spanish also has just one, oh, sounds like in the word go, but shorter. But Portuguese has an additional open, oh, which sounds like the o and pot in Spanish. A bill in Portuguese or view.

Speaker 1:          07:55          And sometimes the diphthong were in Spanish corresponds to the open. Oh, in Portuguese. So in Spanish we have escuela and in Portuguese we have scholar. Now these might not seem like major differences so far, but there are lots of differences like that. Reduced vowels, vowels in Spanish are quite clearly pronounced in their full form, but vowels in Portuguese often become reduced, especially when they are unstressed at the end of a word. So in Spanish we have Gasa, but in Portuguese we have Casa. In Spanish we have it. And in Portuguese we have, in Spanish we have Audi, which means it opens and in Portuguese we have nasal vowels. Portuguese also has five nasal vowels that don't occur in Spanish. I nasal vowel means that some air is released through your nose, which creates a distinct sound. Vowels become nasal [inaudible] when they are followed by a nasal consonant and Emma or an n in Spanish and data and in Portuguese, in Spanish, in Suunto and in Portuguese.

Speaker 1:          09:02          This also happens when there is a Tilda over a vowel like in this Portuguese word, Itamar meaning sister. Because of the extra vowels in Portuguese, there are also more diphthongs meaning two vowels that blend together in one syllable. This includes some nasal diphthongs. For example, in Spanish we have six cm, but in Portuguese it's six sound. In Spanish we have limonus and in Portuguese Lee Moreish. Little differences like these add up to make Portuguese and Spanish sound rather different grammar. Spanish and Portuguese grammar are generally very similar, but they do have numerous differences as well. Gender, both languages basically have two genders, masculine and feminine, but sometimes the gender of cognitive words is different. For example, words in Spanish ending with our masculine and their equivalents in Portuguese ending in honoring our feminine. So in Spanish we have and we actually, which is masculine, but in Portuguese we have [inaudible], which is feminine.

Speaker 1:          10:04          Both languages have for definite articles for the two genders and singular and plural. But notice that Spanish also has the neuter singular definite article. It's not used with nouns, but with adjectives or possessive pronouns in order to use them like nouns for example. [inaudible] which means the important thing is love. In Portuguese it would be, we pretend they were more with all being the masculine, singular, definite article verbs. The way verb tenses work in the two languages is very similar. Almost all verb tenses have an exact equivalent in the other language just with slightly different conjugations. So in Spanish we have no sodas, common, most best color, which means we eat fish and in Portuguese that would be nauseous. [inaudible] saw the present tense form is the same and next to pass 10 sentence in Spanish, a bias commit. On best callow they ate fish and in Portuguese eels middle by.

Speaker 1:          11:03          In this case, the conjugations aren't exactly the same, but they are equivalent. Now a future sentence in Spanish, Yoko made episcopal, which means I will eat fish and in Portuguese it's it will come right page, but without any context given for the simple future tense here, this might sound kind of stiff and people often use the going to future form. Instead. In Portuguese it would be ill for middle based and it's Spanish. It would be, Yup. Boy, yeah. Metaphase Pescara. One difference in the verb system is that the perfect tense is formed with the different auxiliary verb, Spanish uses and then as the auxiliary verb, which means to have but only as an auxiliary verb. The main verb for to have in Spanish is Denette. Portuguese has a verb or veal, but instead the verb did is used as the auxiliary verb, which means to have tish is a cognate of Spanish.

Speaker 1:          11:57          Dennis in Spanish we have a laser liver, which means I have read the book and in Portuguese we have bill. Thank you. Leave Lever, which means I have been reading the book. So notice that the auxiliary verbs are different. And notice that the past participle of the verb, meaning reed, is almost the same, but more importantly, note that this type of sentence means something different than either language. In Spanish it means I have read the book in Portuguese it means I have been reading the book. In other words, the past action is still continuing in order to say, I have read the book in Portuguese, you would use the present tense instead like this, the only leave, I believe that Latin American Spanish is more like Portuguese in this regard, and that difference is only in the present. Perfect. The past perfect doesn't have that kind of difference.

Speaker 1:          12:45          So if we want to express, they had read the book. In Spanish we would say ibm laser liver, and in Portuguese we would say [inaudible] believe the main difference between these two is just the auxiliary verb. We'd order. The word order is generally quite similar between the two languages as you've probably noticed already, but there are some differences too in yes or no questions. In Spanish, the subject can come either before or after the verb. Like this. I've lay gang lists or a gambling lists, but in Portuguese it must come before the verb, like this lfl English, the placement of object pronouns in Spanish, the object Pronoun normally comes before the verb for example. And Mia you though, which means he helped me in Portuguese, it comes after the verb, like this, Il [inaudible] another example in Spanish, maybe that's how you that. Okay, which means are you going to help me or what?

Speaker 1:          13:41          And in Portuguese [inaudible] or visors d'adamo cave. Actually the location of the Pronoun in the first sentence is something that comes from Brazilian Portuguese, but at sometimes used in Portugal too because of the influence of Brazilian Portuguese through Brazilian tv shows and the like. Some people consider the second sentence to be more proper in European Portuguese contractions with prepositions in Spanish prepositions mostly function as individual units with just these exceptions. The preposition that plus the definite article l becomes Dell meaning from that, the preposition plus l becomes added meaning to the, there are just those two in Spanish, but in Portuguese prepositions form all sorts of contractions. So in Spanish we have an [inaudible], which means in the book, but in Portuguese we have new leaf. In Spanish we have, they will not send Yoda, which means from a lady, but in Portuguese we have Duma, slaughter it, Spanish. We have the Aqi meaning from here, but in Portuguese we have the Geek.

Speaker 1:          14:50          These mean Portuguese is a sister language of Spanish in Spanish and in Portuguese, [inaudible] word for word ets. Portuguese is ah, language, sister of the Spanish. These sentences consistent tiredly of cognates and have identical grammar. The main difference is the different definite articles and the words for sister take a somewhat different form and Amana, eat, emote. This pair of words is a good example of how Spanish and Portuguese cognates can sometimes look and sound quite different. Let's look at one more sentence and see what we find. These mean very few countries in the world take pride in having so many different styles of music and dance in Spanish. Mig, Bogo, spices and Amanda [inaudible] word for word. It's very few countries in the world are proud of having so many styles, different of music and dance. And then there's the Portuguese sentence went to Portuguese removed store of yours.

Speaker 1:          15:58          10 stills, the [inaudible] word for word. Very few countries in the world are proud of having so many styles, different of music and dance. Again, these sentences are similar, but there are a few differences. The way of expressing very few, it's slightly different, but the words are cognates. Next, notice that in Portuguese, the preposition and definite article contract together into one word while in Spanish they're separate words. Next we see the verb corresponding to to be in each language. Is that in Spanish and also she taught him in Portuguese. They are both conjugated in the third person, plural. Present tense, but you can see that the conjugated forms are different in either language. Next, the words here are a bit different. The Spanish word is an infinitive form. While the Portuguese is a personal infinitive. The infinitive by itself is, and also notice that the word for dance is different, but also notice that it sounds like the English word ballet by Lee.

Speaker 1:          17:02          Hmm. There's also a cognate word in Portuguese bile, but in Portuguese it refers to an event like a ball or a prom, and in Spanish there's also the word done Fao, which refers to a specific types of artistic dance as opposed to dancing in general. Very often there are possible cognates for every word in a sentence, but they sometimes have a somewhat different usage or frequency of use in either language. In these two similar sentences, we see how similar the two languages can be with the biggest difference, simply lying in pronunciation, but things are often said more differently. For example, a somewhat more natural sentence in Portuguese might be more into [inaudible], tench steels, differential killers in this variation rather than to be plus an adjective. Here we have Ken plus the infinitive of a verb, meaning to be proud. So as you can see, Spanish and Portuguese are indeed sister languages that have a lot in common.

Speaker 1:          18:00          They do have a lot of little differences that altogether and make them distinct languages. But knowing either language would definitely help you learn the other one relatively quickly. So the question of the day for speakers of either Spanish or Portuguese who have studied the other language, did you find it easy to learn what was easy and what was challenging?
