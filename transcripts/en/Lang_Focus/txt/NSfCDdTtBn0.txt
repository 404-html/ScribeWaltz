Speaker 1:          00:00          [inaudible]. No, no. [inaudible]. No. [inaudible]. Hello everyone and welcome to the lange focus channel. My name is Paul. Today I am going to talk about the Spanish language. As you may know, Spain has more than one language, so when I say Spanish, I'm referring specifically to Castilian Spanish, which is spoken as a native language by 74% of the people of Spain and 99% of the people of span including second language speaker. Castilian is the Spanish language that grew to become one of the most important global languages during this video. I might refer to it as Castilian to contrast it with other languages of Spain, but usually I'll refer to it as Spanish. Out of all languages in the world, Spanish has the second largest number of native speakers with 470 million native speakers as well as another 90 million who speak it as a second language. It is also one of the most widely dispersed languages with 44 countries of the world having at least 3 million native speakers of Spanish or more.

Speaker 1:          01:01          It is one of the six official languages of the UN as well as an official language of the European Union. It is also an official language of 21 countries. If we include Puerto Rico, which is a territory of the US. It also used to be an official language of the Philippines, but it is not any more. Spanish is also the third most widely used language on the Internet. According to one source that I consulted, the use of Spanish online has grown by 800% in the past few years. Spanish is a member of the Barrow Romance Subfamily of the Romance Language family. Other members of that sub family include Portuguese galicians and some people say Katelyn, like all romance languages. Spanish developed from Vulgar Latin, the spoken Latin that was brought to the area by the Roman Empire. Vulgar Latin evolved into numerous regional dialects which eventually became distinct enough to be considered different languages. There are documents from the ninth century that are written in an early form of Castilian Spanish or we could say a late form of vulgar Latin.

Speaker 1:          02:01          In any case, documents like these show that the vulgar Latin dialects were becoming separate languages. By that point, Castilian Spanish is the language that our role is in the north central region of the Berrien Peninsula called Castiel and it grew more and more distinct from its neighbor language Leo needs. It became firmly established as a distinct language in the 13th century when King I'll funds, oh decided to standardize the written language for official use based on the dialect spoken in Toledo. It process, which continued for a few hundred years until the 16th century in the 13 hundreds of the southern part of the Iberian peninsula was under the control of al and the loose a Muslim controlled territory that had previously controlled most of the peninsula that Econ Kista, which means the reconquest resulted in the retaking of the Muslim areas and of the spread of Castilian Spanish to the south.

Speaker 1:          02:50          There it was influenced by the most Arabic dialects. Those were romanced dialects spoken by Muslims in Alanda loose that contained a lot of loan words from Arabic castilian Spanish absorbed a lot of those Arabic loan words up to 4,000 words or 8% of the modern languages vocabulary. Some common Spanish words of Arabic origin are Asda, which means until that comes from the Arabic word Hata with the same meaning or law, which means I hope comes from the Arabic word low shalla or in Shell law, which means if it's God's will, a set day, which means oil as in olive oil comes from the Arabic word as it with the same meaning. There were also a lot of words in Spanish that begin with Aal out, which is the Arabic definite article. For example, alcohol from the Arabic word alcohol, which of course means alcohol and alcohol day, which means mayor comes from the Arabic word, alcohol d, which means judge in Arabic.

Speaker 1:          03:46          That's just a couple of examples, but there are lots of words beginning with AOL in Spanish. The Christian reconquest of the South successfully ended in 1492 and that very same year, Spain began sending explorers like Christopher Columbus abroad to build the Spanish empire, the Spanish language spread along with the Empire to the Americas, to the Spanish east indies, which includes present day Philippines and to some parts of Africa. One area it spread to us, Mexico, which today has the largest Spanish speaking population of any country with 120 million speakers of Spanish. The variety of Spanish spoken in Mexico varies somewhat from the variety spoken in Spain and that's true for the other Spanish speaking countries as well. The standard written language is basically the same everywhere, but the spoken language has some differences, especially in pronunciation and in vocabulary and especially in common daily vocabulary like clothing, food and things like that.

Speaker 1:          04:38          In Latin America, various native languages influenced the different local varieties of Spanish. What's the best variety of Spanish to learn? Well, the varieties are often categorized into European, Spanish and Latin American Spanish. From what I understand, there isn't a lot of difference for beginners. No matter which variety you'll learn, you will be able to adapt to other varieties quite easily. Personally, I've met more Spanish speakers from Mexico than from any other country. So for me that's the natural choice. But for you it depends on which variety you are most likely to use and which one you're most interested in. Like romance languages in general, Spanish shares a lot of vocabulary with English, not identical vocabulary, but related vocabulary that you can figure out and you can more easily remember if you associate it with the related English words. Let's take a look at a couple of sentences.

Speaker 1:          05:27          Cuanto Cuesta when via Nueva York. Okay, so the first word Quanto that sounds to me like quantity. So I think it means how much because this is a question. The next word, Cuesta. Well, I think that probably means cost. The next word I know that means, ah, the indefinite article, the next word via. Well that looks like voyage to me or voyage in French. So I think it means a voyage or a trip. And then I know means to, and Nueva York, of course, that means New York. So I think means how much does a trip to New York costs if we translate it literally, how much costs a trip to New York. Another sentence [inaudible] to say no to movies. So let's look at it word by word L. I know that means the definite article on bread. That's a word I know from movies and stuff. I think that means if men come to say, well, I'm not sure, let's come back to that one in a second. [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          06:22          is up and I would do movie. That means automobile car. So go back to come to say, well maybe that means conduct. Or in this case you don't conduct an automobile, you drive an automobile. So this means the man drives an automobile or demand drives a car. So you can see that. You can figure out what those words mean. If you look at each word and analyze them. It's not always that easy. But that's an easy example. So you know what I mean? And also if we look at the syntax of those sentences, we can see that they're very similar to English. So the first sentence again, Quanto Questa in via a on Nueva York. Um, so how much costs a trip to New York? So quite similar to English, but just sort of simplified the next sentence. The man drives a car. That one is word by word, exactly the same as English.

Speaker 1:          07:09          So it's translatable directly. Of course the grammar gets more complicated than that. But just the most basic syntax is very similar to English. So this is one of the benefits of learning a romance language for English speakers. According to the American Foreign Service Institute, Spanish is a category one language that means that relatively speaking it is one of the easier languages for native English speakers to learn. So what are you waiting for and then some Spaniel or should I say [inaudible]? I'm not sure because Spanish speakers themselves can't actually agree on this issue. In the red colored countries, the preferred term is custody ended, the blue colored countries, the preferred term is espanol. And in Spain you can see that there is some disagreement about which term is best. If you're a native speaker of Spanish, maybe you can tell us what you think about that in the comments down below and other people you can leave your comments to. Thank you for watching. Have a nice day.
