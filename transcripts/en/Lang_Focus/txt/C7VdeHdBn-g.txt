Speaker 1:          00:08          Hello everyone, welcome to the Lange Focus Channel and my name is Bob. Today I'm going to talk about the multis language. Maltese is a unique and interesting language because it is a Semitic language with a twist. It is the only Semitic language that is an official language of the European Union. It is spoken by around 520,000 people, mostly on the island nation of Malta, which is an island in the Mediterranean Sea, not far from Sicily and not far from Tunisia and Libya in North Africa. Some people claim that Maltese is a descendant of the ancient Phoenician language, but actually there is no linguistic evidence for this Maltese as a descendant of a dialect of Arabic called low Arabic or Sicilian Arabic, but it has diverged quite a lot from Arabic over the last thousand years or so and has now become its own language. The syntax and grammar of Maltese remains Arabic and about a third of the vocabulary is still Arabic and that includes most of the grammatical function words as well as a lot of the most basic vocabulary.

Speaker 1:          01:03          About half of the vocabulary is from Italian or Sicilian, and the remaining vocabulary is mostly from English and French. It's still considered a Semitic language because of its Arabic origin and because of its structure, but if you take into account all of the foreign loan words, especially the Romance Sloan words, then it's essentially a hybrid language. Kind of like a Semitic romance hybrid. So how did this interesting mix of influences come together to create Maltese? Well, it's because of its history, of course, the fatigue, mid caliphate, which covered much of North Africa, conquered Sicily at the end of the ninth century and brought their grubby or north African dialect of Arabic with them. Then in 10, 49 ce, Arabic speaking Muslim settlers from Sicily arrived in Malta, which is only about 200 kilometers away and began to establish communities. They're in the year 10 91 ce. The normans who were Christians from Normandy and present a France, had defeated the Arabs and taken hold of Sicily, and then began taking hold of multitude under Norman rule.

Speaker 1:          02:02          More settlers from Sicily began arriving in Malta and bringing their language with them. Even though the normans were Christian, the population of Sicily was still a mixture of Christians and Muslims who spoke Arabic alongside the Sicilian language. After the decline of Norman rule, the new regime in Sicily expelled all of the Muslims from Sicily and from Malta as well. This was a very significant event because it essentially cut off the low Arabic dialect from the Muslim Arabic speaking world, and it also cut it off from the classical Arabic language and other Arabic speaking lands. The Qur'an remains a conservative force that prevented the dialects from changing too much overtime, but in Multa, that conservative force was no longer connected to the dialect, so the dialect was free to drift off in its own direction and become a new language. Seek low Arabic diet out in Sicily, but it continued to be used and evolve.

Speaker 1:          02:50          In Malta, Malta remained part of the Kingdom of Sicily for several hundred years, which brought lots of Sicilian vocabulary into the language. The island was controlled by a string of rulers who influenced the developing multis language. One of the most significant regimes to rule Malta was the knights hospitaller of St John. A powerful order of nights that assisted in protected Christian pilgrims on their way to the holy land. They were given the island of Malta in 15 slash 30 as an outpost to help prevent an automated invasion of Rome from the south. They made Italian the official language of the island and it remained the official language until 1934. This resulted in a large amount of Italian vocabulary entering the language. There was also a period of two years when Melissa was under French rule and just from those two years quite a bit of French vocabulary entered the language too and the island was a British protectorate from 1800 to 1956.

Speaker 1:          03:40          And of course that led to the adoption of lots of English words into Maltese. So multis is essentially an Arabic dialect that has become latinized and to some extent anglicised. So how similar is it to Arabic today? Well, if you know Arabic and you try to read some Maltese, you will quickly realize that it's basically Arabic instructor, but you will also see a lot of foreign vocabulary. Mostly romance vocabulary in it's most similar to the mug. Grab dialects of Arabic, meaning the dialects of Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia, especially the Tunisian dialect. A lot of Tunisians claim that they can quite easily understand multis. That could be because Tunisian Arabic itself has quite a few Italian loan words and I also understand that a lot of Tunisians can understand standard Italian, so if they speak and Arabic and Italian than they can quite easily understand multis.

Speaker 1:          04:26          Lots of people say that if you know an Arabic dialect quite well, and if you also know Italian, then reading Maltese won't be much of a problem and with some adjustment you can also learn to understand it fairly easily. That doesn't mean you could speak proper Maltese, but maybe you could use your Arabic, endure Italian and sort of pack a conversation in a new pigeon language. So let's look at a couple examples. Sentences of multis. So this sentence here is an example of one that's mostly Arabic. By the way, I've never learned to speak Maltese, so forgive my pronunciation. It'll Japa Nandua last populates. That buck dot mia situ ushered in million petta sooner. Now I understood this sentence almost perfectly, and it's basically all Arabic. Uh, the first word, illegit boone. That's Japan on blue. That's has a last shot. That's the 10th. That's the biggest pool.

Speaker 1:          05:13          That's the one that's not Arabic, but that's, that looks like an Italian lone word to me type thing. Yeah. So that's in the world. The appetite mean that means with more of them. And then there's the Arabic number, mia said to ocean and then there's mulloon which is million and Arabic too. And then pepper summa, which is not Arabic, but I guess that's from Italian Sicilian. But sometimes you see sentences with a lot more loan words, particularly Italian. Here's another sentence you form a field of [inaudible] on that includes the other printer. Pewter Solid Arrietta. So this sentence means migration reform must include the principle of solidarity. This one has a lot of loan words. The Pharma, that's not an Arabic word, that's alone word feeling bigger. That sione field, that part is Arabic, but make it. That's the one that is a long word under that part is interesting because this is an Arabic word that means has, but in this case it's being used to mean has to or must and it's not used that way in Arabic, so the function of this word has become somewhat adapted in the multis language.

Speaker 1:          06:07          The next word included. That's include but that the t links back to the previous vowel and that's an element of Arabic syntax. The next word friendship you. So that's obviously principal, but that's not an Arabic word. That's a long word. And tests. Solar Data Yetta. Again, that's the Arabic definite article and the t is linking back to the previous vowel and solid data yetta. That's solidarity and that's not an Arabic word either, so you can see a lot of sentences like this and Maltese. Often if you have no Arabic you'll recognize the structure, but then a lot of the words are not Arabic. For me personally, I know that with my past study of Arabic and with my fluency in English and my recent basic knowledge of Italian, I can take a stab at reading multis and I can understand a fair bit of it, but not all of it.

Speaker 1:          06:48          When I hear spoken Maltese, I don't really understand it, but I can pick out some individual Arabic and Italian and English words, but I imagined that as my Italian improves, I'll be able to understand a bit more of it and if I decided to review my Arabic in depth and start to learn on my grubby dialect, then I think I would be able to understand a lot more Maltese as well. Maltese is not a very widely spoken language, so not that many people learn it and there aren't that many materials out there for learners, but for someone who's learning Arabic or learning Italian than it might be fun to dabble in some multis and see what you can make of it.

Speaker 1:          07:26          If you're an Arabic speaker and you've had a chance to listen to multis a little bit, let us know what you think. Can you understand it? Does it sound like a kind of Arabic? And the same goes for Italian speakers. If you listen to [inaudible], can you catch parts of what they're saying? Let us know in the comments down below, we're getting close to 50,000 subscribers on Lang Focus. That's quite cool. I'm quite excited about that, but if I look at my social media channels, if I look at facebook, twitter, and Instagram, I noticed that I still don't have that many followers, so be sure to have a look at those.
