So does this one and this one? It's not bad. And how about the next one? Oh my gosh. What the heck is that? Hello everyone. Welcome to the Lange Focus Channel and my name is Paul. Today we're going to talk about the Japanese writing system. Well, not the entire writing system. Japanese is written with three different scripts. He's gonna cut that out, and Congee, which is the one that we want to focus on today. He had gone to and cut to conduct, were developed in Japan, but congee are actually Chinese characters that were adapted to fit the Japanese language. Come Gr logograms a logo. Graham is a character that represents a word or a meaningful part of a word. Congee are not characters that you read phonetically, but rather each congee represents a distinct idea rather than a sound.

Speaker 1:          00:58          For example, this congee on its own represents the concept of a mountain, but just from looking at it, there's no way to know that it's pronounced as Yama. You have to remember how the characters pronounced and when you see the character, you associate it with the sound, but some congee do also contain a phonetic element, which is something we'll look at later. Japan initially came into contact with Chinese characters during diplomatic missions between the Han Dynasty and the Yamato State of Japan, which eventually led to the Japanese adoption and adaptation of Congee. I talk more about this in my video on the Japanese language, which you can find right here if we include every country that has ever been used in Japanese. There are tens of thousands of them, but of course that includes many obscure or archaic congee. There really aren't worth learning. For the average person in 1946, the Japanese government aimed to simplify orthography by limiting the number of congee to a smaller list of 1,850 country known as the Toyo Congee or common use congee.

Speaker 1:          01:56          That list has since been updated to include 2000, 136 basic congee, which are referred to as the congee or regular use congee. This list determines what congee students are expected to learn at school and what congee or used in official government documents. With this part of the reform, the Japanese government also simplified some of the more complex congee so that they could be read more easily. These congee are called Shinji tie, which literally means new character forms. For example, this congee meaning iron, the component on the right with simplified, and this congee meaning wide. It's inner component was simplified like this. You might be aware that such a simplification also occurred in the adoption of simplified Chinese writing and trying to, but we're much more limited in scope and these changes only affected a limited number of characters in Japanese types of congee. Congee can be divided into several categories of mudgee or characters based on how each character is formed.

Speaker 1:          02:54          For example, there are showcased Emoji. This refers to pictograph congee such as this one for a mountain or this one for tree. These ones look something like the objects that they represent, she g Magii and Kai Emoji are iddio graphs, characters that represent ideas rather than visually representing an object. For example, this congee meaning up and this one meaning rest. The difference between these two types of video graphs is that she gmo, are rather simple. Whereas Emoji are compound idiographic that use multiple components that combined together to create an overall meaning with each of the components also existing as independent congee. The component on the left means person and the components on the right means tree. A person leaning against the tree is resting. This is a good example of Emoji. Another example is this congee. Let's see if we can figure out what this one means by looking at the components.

Speaker 1:          03:49          I see this character which I know means mountain, and I see this one which means up and this one which means down, so I'm going to guess that this country has something to do with traveling up or down a mountain like maybe it's hiking. Now, if we look at the actual meaning of this country will see that it means a path through the mountains or a mountain pass, so I'd say that's pretty close. This type of Congee that kind of tells a story is a of Emoji, but only a small number of congee, telecom, apprehensive story like that. By far, the largest grouping of Kanji is Casei Emoji. These are congee that combined semantic and phonetic elements to make up a new character. The phonetic element is derived from the Chinese pronunciation of the Congee, the own your me, which we'll talk about later. A good example of case, a Emoji is sheep, which means poem.

Speaker 1:          04:35          If we look at the left side of the country, we see this component which is most often used in characters that have something to do with language or speaking, such as this one meaning language and this one, meaning speaking. If we look at the component on the right side of this country, we see the congee for temple. This doesn't indicate any semantic connection to temples, but rather at serves as an indicator of how to pronounce this country. The Chinese pronunciation of this Kanji for temple is sheep or ge, and when you see it as a component within another congee, it indicates that that Congee is pronounced as sheet or GE radicals in the characters we looked at in the previous example of case a Emoji. The component on the left is the radical. A radical is the main component of a Kanji that generally provides a clue about its root meaning.

Speaker 1:          05:21          Some people use the term radical to refer to any component of a congee like both of these, but to be precise only. This element is the radical. They'll both can be referred to as components. Every congee contains one radical. Some radicals also exist as independent congee such as this one meaning gold or money. It appears as a radical with the root meaning of metal. Here we can see it and this congee meaning iron, and in this one meaning copper. Other radicals only exist as an inseparable component of a Kanji like this one, which shows that the congee has a meaning related to movement, like in this congee meaning road, and this one meaning pass or communicate. As for phonetic components, they don't appear on all Kanji, but they appear on many of them and can be very useful in pronouncing congee. One example is this one which we saw before in the Kanji for copper.

Speaker 1:          06:12          This congee on its own is pronounced dove, and when you see it as a component in another country, it indicates that the pronunciation is Dole or toll. As you can see, these congee here have nothing to do with each other semantically and the radicals are different. They're only related in pronunciation. Another quick example is this congee meaning opposition. It's pronounced hun. Now look at this. Congee meaning cooked rice or meal. It's also pronounced Han based on that phonetic element, and so it was this one meaning sales and this one meaning printing or publishing. They're all pronounced time. Well, they're sometimes pronounced time sometimes. What do you mean? Sometimes the phonetic elements of congee or based on the Chinese reading of the Congee, also known as the O'neill meet reading and you'll meet just means reading by the way, own Naomi and Naomi. If you remember from my previous video on Japanese, there are two basic ways to pronounce congee.

Speaker 1:          07:07          Own Naomi Chinese derived readings and couldn't. You'll meet native Japanese readings, for example. This character has a native couldn't reading of cutoff while also having the own reading. Hen when used in this word, hemp meaning a broken piece. The own Naomi is used when used in this word Khatami, meaning each way the native Naomi is used. The real complexity comes with the congee that have multiple own readings and multiple coon readings requiring you to choose the correct reading based on the context. One example is this congee meaning life or birth. It has to own your meter readings, say and show. So we have this word, gene said, meaning human life and this word to show which means beast or it, and it also has numerous Cuneo Naomi readings. Here are some examples. There's a key to meaning to live. There's a meaning to give birth. There's meaning to grow.

Speaker 1:          08:04          There's higher meaning to grow or spring up. There's key meaning pure or raw, and there's no meaning raw or uncooked. As you can see, it's not always a simple matter of one conduit being equivalent to one word. The congee is used to represent the core meaning of the word, but when we use them for native Japanese verbs and adjectives, a string of Uba, Ghana is attached to the end to represent the inflection of the word. For example, let's look at the adjective for cold. Some Louie, as you can see, there's a congee and the additional Gunna he. The congee, carries the core meaning of the word while the inflection shown, and he had a gun. It shows us that this word is in the non past positive form for an adjective, so we read this as some wheat, but when we inflect this word in the negative, it becomes where crew night replaces eat to indicate the non negative form.

Speaker 1:          08:56          When we look at this word, we know to read it as someone who night with the first two syllables represented by the congee and the others placed after it. To show inflection comes, you also worked this way with verbs were the congee will represent the core meaning of the verb and the heat. I gonna represent the verbs, conjugations. Why bother using congee if part of the writing is in Hida anyway, even though congee take a lot of effort to learn, they actually make the entire language easier to read. Let's take a look at an example sentence first written without congee and next written with congee. This sentence means I eat Japanese food book wash, Tub, Amos, because Japanese is written without spaces, without the congee. The words all blend together and it's sometimes difficult to quickly see where one word ends and where the next word begins or it's difficult to see what part of speech or where it is congee or not really read, but just recognized like symbols. So they allow you to quickly skim a sentence for meeting, but while Congee make Japanese easier to read, once you know them, they make Japanese much harder to write by hand. As you can see, some congee consist of lots of different lines or strokes. For example, this congee, meaning machine or opportunity, has 16 strokes.

Speaker 1:          10:13          This one, meaning appraise has 23 strokes. If we dig back into some historical Kanji that are not part of the current Joel Congee, some of them have quite a high number of strokes. This congee, meaning rough or crude, has 33 strokes. You can see that this one is actually created through reduplicate of the same component three times. That component is the congee, meaning deer.

Speaker 1:          10:41          Here's another conduit, meaning dragons on the move, which has 48 strokes and consists of the congee for dragon reduplicated three times as components, and this congee features the same component four times for a total of 64 strokes. It means verbose. The biggest freak show of a congee is this one with 84 strokes. It features this congee as a component which is itself a rigid application of the congee for cloud, and it also features the dragons on the move. Congee as a component. I don't think the origins or usage of this country are very clear, but it may have been used in personal names. These high stroke congee are very rare. They're not really used anymore, but congee have up to 20 strokes or even a little higher are quite common. Not only do you have to remember the strokes themselves, but you have to write them in the correct order in the correct direction.

Speaker 1:          11:31          There are a series of rules that govern stroke order. The most basic rule is top to bottom and left to right with the congee for river, we can see that you write a stroke from top to bottom, then you move to the right and add two more strokes, but the first stroke seems to go from right to left. That's true, but here are the top to bottom. Rule takes precedence, so this has allowed the next when vertical and horizontal cross, the horizontal line is usually written first. We can see this in the congee for 10. Next, vertical strokes that cross through other strokes are written after the strokes they cross through. We can see this in the congee, meaning middle or in horizontal strokes that cross through other strokes are written last. We can see this in the congee for mother. Next diagonal strokes are written right to left before left to right as we can see in the congee meaning letter or writings. Next, central vertical strokes are written before their wings. We can see this in the country, meaning water. Next left vertical strokes are written before strokes that go across and down. As we can see in the congee, meaning mouth this across a downstroke is quite common and it's important not to mistake it for two strokes. It's just one stroke. Next enclosures are normally written before the components inside them. We can see that in the congee, meaning wide.

Speaker 1:          12:54          An exception to that is some enclosures that have a bottom stroke which are written last. We can see this in the congee, meaning near

Speaker 1:          13:03          and short little strokes or dashes are often written last, even if that contradicts the top to bottom rule. We can see this in the country, meaning seek. Most of these stroke order rules become second nature after awhile if you practice, but I must admit that I hardly ever write Kanji by hand these days. These days people type on their smartphones and computers a lot more than they write by hand. When typing congee on a smart phone or computer, you type the phonetic pronunciation and then a list of congee with that pronunciation appears and you choose the appropriate one. A well known result of this reliance on technology is that Japanese speakers ability to write Kanji by hand has declined. It's pretty common to see someone filling out a form or something and then pull out a smartphone to check how to write a certain congee. It's important to point out that not every native speaker of Japanese will be able to read every Kanji character that they encountered, especially in place names or personal names.

Speaker 1:          13:58          It's not uncommon for me to ask a native speaker how to pronounce the name of a place, for example, and for them to tell me that they don't know, but they can often give it a shot based on what looks like a phonetic element in the congee and if they don't know the meaning, they might be able to guess the general meaning based on the radical of the congee. While learning congee is time consuming and may seem overwhelming. Remember that congee or a part of Japanese culture, history and literature, and if you treat them like a puzzle to solve or a mystery to unravel, then it becomes much more motivating and the congee seem much less intimidating. The question of the day for native speakers of Japanese, do you think congee are necessary for the Japanese language? Would you be able to speak Japanese the same as you do now? If congee, we're not a part of the language and for learners of Japanese, how much of a challenge or Kanji for you and how do you deal with the challenge? Be sure to follow Lang, focus on facebook, twitter, and Instagram, and once again, thank you to all of my amazing patrion supporters, especially these ones right here on the screen who are my top tier patrion supporters. Thank you for watching and have a nice day.
