Speaker 1:          00:00          Hello everyone, welcome to the focus channel and my name is Paul. Today. Rather than get into a new indepth language documentary, I decided to do a fun little video that we can do together. I want to give you a challenge. I want to present you with some mystery languages and you can listen and look at those languages and guess what languages they are, but don't worry, even if you don't guess the language correctly, it'll still be interesting as long as you share the reasons for your guesses in the comments down below. So let's give it a try. Here's the first language. Please listen

Speaker 2:          00:34          almost as good as get back because they know me when I just to put in the sweat, did look in the dark with some of the what is it, what we see as they go, really?

Speaker 1:          00:57          Okay, and let me also show you a little bit of that language in its written form. I don't speak this language, but I'll try to read it as best I can gamble and he went back up. So what language is it?

Speaker 1:          01:18          The language is Haitian creole. If you're a French speaker, then right away you might have known that this was Haitian creole and other people, you might have noticed some words that sounded French, but sounded a little different. That's because the Haitian creole language is a French based creole language. It arose in the 17th and 18th centuries because of interaction between French settlers and African slaves in the area that is now called Haiti. The majority of its vocabulary derives from French, but the majority of its syntax to rise from the African languages spoken by the slips. Let's go back to those two examples sentences for a second game. Mooney valley. This means is there a person here who speaks English? The beginning of the sentence doesn't really seem French means to have or there is. It might derive from the French word gun yet, but the way it's used as quite different from the French word and moon means person and I don't know the origin of this word is it is like in French, in French.

Speaker 1:          02:14          The whole sentence I guess would be India, calc one, Siki, Pat Langley. The second sentence went back up. Ballet, I'm. This means I can't speak English when it comes from one in French. Pop is the French negation marker. Pop Cup comes from the French couple color pallet's partly so the vocabulary has all kinds of French, but in French it would be like this. You shouldn't sweep back a public park Langley, so obviously the grammar is very different even though the vocabulary is French based. Notice that in the French sentence, why is not used but is used. That's because in French was the object Pronoun. Wells is the subject. Pronouns in Haitian creole went is both. Now I'm breaking down these sentences just to show you that Haitian creole is a combination of French and other influences.

Speaker 3:          03:08          Like William helped because it gave me a this quarter. What am I going to be challenged by? Volley ball, volleyball, petroleum and Yoko needs or glade helper. You only have moved the number from the leaders from and that's why the egg before for sure. Look,

Speaker 1:          03:31          and again, let me show you a little bit of that language in its written form,

Speaker 4:          03:34          Bene in Esl scene and more shoots in streatham clear at all and now he dot from on his phone on him. Nor were they.

Speaker 1:          03:53          So what language is it? The language is Phrygian specifically West Virginia West Division has spoken in a northern province of the Netherlands called friesland. Freshmen is thought to be the language that is most closely related to English. Now it doesn't mean that it's easy for English speakers to understand friction when I hear it or when I try to read it, I barely understand anything but it is closely related to English and its historical development and in the structure of the language. All right, let's do one last language. Please listen.

Speaker 5:          04:23          Like is it just pulls out that. So it goes under the Jamaican guy. So I've been buying for Bella so I'd be there about budget dry.

Speaker 1:          04:42          And again, let's look at a couple of phrases visually. Now I don't speak this language, but I'll try to read these as best I can. Knowing comprendo nonfatal suicide to do meet this bloody boo. So what language is it?

Speaker 1:          04:57          Well, if you know a romance language than you probably noticed right away that this is definitely another romance language. It is actually the Sardinian language, which is spoken on the island of Sardinia in Italy. It is one of many regional languages in Italy that are often mistakenly referred to as dialects, but they're actually separate languages. Most of them are closely related to Italian, but they are different enough to be considered different languages. Well, I hope you enjoyed guessing today's mystery languages even if you didn't get them right. That's okay. It should be interesting to share your reasons in the comments down below and that should spark some interesting discussion and if you would like to see more mystery language videos like this sometime in the future, then let me know and I might do it again.
