Speaker 1:          00:00          Hello everyone, welcome to the Lange Focus Channel and my name is Paul and welcome to another edition of mystery languages. If this is your first time watching a mystery languages video, they'd let me tell you how it goes. I'll play you a sample of a language or a couple of samples of a language and you can listen and guess what each language might be. You might not get the exact language, but you might get the region or the language family or something like that, and that's a partial success in itself. Today's language samples were submitted by Lang focus viewers via instagram, so I'm especially excited about today's episode, so let's get started.

Speaker 2:          00:37          Please listen. Yes, some of upper management Snow Heidi, who never came in Kakapo cookie bites one year ago. Has that thought about tune on united. I live Aristo covered cocky, mucin, and lookup. What's a good had not hired?

Speaker 1:          00:59          Now let's look at a few samples with writing.

Speaker 2:          01:02          Yes. The gunnel mechanic authority boost. Not good care there today. Yes. Chimp, Joshy, ICA echo.

Speaker 1:          01:12          So what language do you think it might be?

Speaker 1:          01:21          The language is Armenian. Armenian is the official language of the Republic of Armenia, but more than half of it speakers live in other countries in Armenian minority communities. It's a member of the Indo European language family, but it forms its own branch of Indo European because it's linked to other languages in the family are not really known, but it has borrowed a large amount of vocabulary from Persian, so Persian speakers might recognize a lot of words in Armenian. The stress and Armenian generally falls on the final syllable of the word. Not always, but it usually does, unless the word has the definite article or a possessive adjective at the end. If we read along with the sentences we heard before, we can notice that the stress usually comes at the end.

Speaker 2:          02:04          Yes, mechanic authority. How boost

Speaker 1:          02:07          on this recording this word sounds like it has the stress on the first syllable like Connie, but in other sources it sounds more like Connie with the stress on the second syllable. That might depend on the sentence level. Stress of the sentence as a whole.

Speaker 2:          02:22          Not Good. Kevin, today. Yes. Chimp, Joshy, ICA.

Speaker 1:          02:28          There are two standard varieties of Armenian western Armenian, eastern Armenian, which have some significant differences. The variety that you heard in the samples was eastern Armenian. This map shows the distribution of western Armenian and eastern Armenian dialects at the beginning of the 20th century, but most speakers of western Armenian now live in diaspora communities. Okay. Now onto the next language. Please listen night.

Speaker 3:          02:53          Mr. Mr Wyangela on where I'm going to say. Let's see. One. I ended up repeatedly take old, worn out. I don't plan on. We don't know. We're flying night. Galileo Galilei Pitney's only leak Amman at Tennessee Pitney. Pitney Barlett beating the bottle. All of us are not. Are polycystic comfy together. Amman, where I in say, I mean not in good. Tal. Why then? People are really, really wicked. Not. Tell going, tell about why Sarafina Pitney Garden Wall.

Speaker 1:          03:31          Now let's look at a few more sentences with writing.

Speaker 3:          03:34          Meanwhile, I'm buying some clothes. She borrowed the book from the library. Me. Now I'm going on tonight,

Speaker 1:          03:42          so what language could it be?

Speaker 4:          03:49          Cool.

Speaker 1:          03:50          The language is Jamaican Patois, as the name suggests. Jamaican Patois is spoken in Jamaica. It has around $3 million native speakers. It's an English based creole that developed in the 17th and 18th centuries through contact between African slaves and English speaking slave owners. The official language of Jamaica is English and Jamaican. Patois is spoken on a continuum with standard Jamaican English. That means that in some situations speakers will be essentially using standard English with a characteristic Jamaican accent. Well, in other situations, speakers will mix English with varying degrees of Patois and at the very casual end of the spectrum, speakers might use Jamaican patois exclusively. The three sentences that we saw on the screen, we're pretty close to standard English, but the longer reading that you heard was full on Jamaican Patois, but we do see some grammatical and phonological changes in those three sentences. Take the third one. For instance,

Speaker 3:          04:43          now I'm going on tonight.

Speaker 1:          04:46          Jamaican patois uses me as the subject pronouns rather than the negative is now instead of not and noticed that there is a double negative with no being used where any would be used in English. Notice that going to is abbreviated to go on and of course the pronunciation is different to Dina and tonight are close to the standard English equivalents just with slightly different pronunciation and spelling to match and onto the next language. Please listen.

Speaker 5:          05:14          Yeah, we at the illegal hit on my eggs. Salmon on your Buddha, Allah Aleda a late hit our, let's say a Nicholean household in order to Arizona. So

Speaker 1:          05:41          next we'll look at a few sentences with writing.

Speaker 5:          05:44          I do.

Speaker 1:          05:46          Hi. I'm able to take away. That's in the morning. We had AP. So what language could this possibly be?

Speaker 1:          06:00          The language is what our need is an indigenous language of South America. It's spoken by over 6 million people, including most of the population of Paraguay, where it's an official language alongside Spanish. It's also spoken in parts of neighboring Argentina, Bolivia, and Brazil. It's a member of the Tupi language family, which consists of around 70 languages scattered throughout South America. One feature of gluttony that we can notice is that every syllable consists of a consonant plus a vowel or a vowel. A syllable cannot end in a consonant and there are no consonant clusters. To me, this gives the language a pleasant light, floating quality kind of sing song me, but without tones. Another thing that adds to this quality is squat. On these nasal sounds, guarani has six oral vowels and six nasal vowels. Also, all voiced stops are either pre, nasally, before an oral vowel or initialized before a nasal valve.

Speaker 1:          06:56          There's also nasal harmony, meaning that stressed nasal vowels cause other surrounding sounds to become nasal as well. We can see an example of this in this sentence. I do a session on her. This is the word for clothes and this is a future efforts showing that the known will be obtained in the future. This ethics has a nasal vowel which makes the earlier vowels, nasal as well. Listen for it. I do, I do. All right, so let's check out one final language. Please listen. Schumer and Macau, I guess on show, Maurice, fair alum, non show mercy. Maurice Rutherglen, mosquito ligand faking tele fish. I guess Domico of Mcclellan. Komatsu is marching on spouse, pre atomic dome fain. Now let's look at a few samples with writing, but welcome Ada cannock for she lower Air Issaquah, own Liberland, neve egg, Dinair gigamon knocked, so what language do you think it might be?

Speaker 1:          08:00          The language is Irish, as you can probably guess. Irish is the historical language of Ireland. It still spoken as a native language there by a minority of people and has learned as a heritage language by most others to varying degrees. It's also known as Irish Gaelic and is a member of the Celtic language family. One interesting feature of Irish is that all consonants have two forms abroad form and a slender form depending on the surrounding vowels. There are three broad vowels in three slender vowels that determine which form of the consonant is used. The slender form of the consonants are palatalized, which generally sounds like a place to write after the continent. If we look at this word, piano, we see this consonant twice. The first is before a narrow vowel, and the second is after abroad vowel. The broad form is God, but the narrow form is like, ha ha. There are similar Paris for all continents. We can see another example of this in the word junior. The d sound is next to a narrow vowel, so what's palatalized like deer or Jay Vignette yet? I don't know if all speakers say the narrow consonants the same way and to be honest, I can't hear it in this word on the recording. We listened to it, but I can hear it in this sample from the [inaudible] website.

Speaker 1:          09:21          10 Deanna, the genius in this sample. We can hear the narrow d sound as well as a narrow end, which makes the sound. Yeah. Well, that's all for today's mystery languages video. Thanks to all the Lang focus viewers who submitted their language samples via instagram.
