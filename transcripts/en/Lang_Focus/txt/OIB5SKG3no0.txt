Speaker 1:          00:00          A lot of people have been waiting for this video for a long time, so let's get right into it. Let's talk about geeks. I am a geek. I'm a language Geek, but these days I'm also a video making geek. Perhaps the most famous geeks in the world are Otaku people who are obsessed with Japanese animation and comic book culture. Our Mickey, what do you want?

Speaker 2:          00:22          Sorry, Mickey. I don't understand what you're saying, so hold on a second. Oh, right.

Speaker 1:          00:38          Hello everyone. Welcome to the Lange Focus Channel and my name is Paul. Today's topic is the Greek language or as it's called in Greek. The word Greek is a word that instantly brings to mind images of ancient civilizations and culture. It may not be the most widely spoken language in the world today, but it did play an extremely influential role in the development of other European languages and in European culture in general. Today, it's spoken by more than 13 million native speakers, mainly in Greece where it's the only official language and a spoken by 11 million people. The Republic of Cyprus where it's spoken by around 975,000 people and by minorities and parts of Albania, Italy and Turkey, as well as by Greek immigrants living all around the world. Whether you realize it or not, if you know English, you know some Greek, around 6% of the vocabulary of English is of Greek origin, and some estimates reach as high as 12 to 15% and if we look specifically at the sciences and technology, the proportion of Greek words and roots skyrockets dramatically.

Speaker 1:          01:41          When you mentioned the encyclopedia, or when you talk about physics class or when you ask for the butter, you're using words that developed from Greek history, Greek as a member of the Hellenic branch of the Indo European language family. Some consider Hellenic to be a single language branch consisting of only Greek, while others consider some varieties of modern Greek to be closely related but separate languages. The development of Greek can be broken down into a number of stages. Prodo Greek protocol, Greek or protocol, Hellenic developed from Prodo Indo European and was probably spoken in the third millennium bce. Over 4,000 years ago as Hellenic people migrated into the Belkin peninsula, or maybe even earlier, depending on where and when. Prodo Indo European originated Mycenaean Greek Mycenaean Greek is the form of Greek that developed in Mycenaean Greece in the second millennium bce when the Greek mainland first advanced civilization arose. The earliest known Greek text comes from this period dating back to around 1400 bce.

Speaker 1:          02:43          It's a clay tablet written in a writing system called linear b, not the system that we know today as the Greek alphabet. The existence of such tablets makes Greek, the oldest recorded living language. To be clear, there are older texts written in other languages like Sumerian, Egyptian hieroglyphics, and the KTN, but those are all dead languages. While Greek has lived on until today, sometime toward the end of the Mycenaean Greek stage or in the early part of the ancient Greek stage, the Greek alphabet was adopted. The date of adoption is around 1100 bce plus or minus a couple of hundred years. We're not quite sure. The Greek alphabet was derived from the Phoenician alphabet with Greek adopting and modifying the finish and letters, and generally keeping similar sounds for each one. There are also several unique Greek letters that did not derive from Phoenician. You may notice that some of the symbols are reversed that might be explained by the fact that physician was written from right to left while Greek is written from left to right.

Speaker 1:          03:41          At first, there were numerous local varieties of the Greek alphabet, but the standard 24 letter Greek alphabet became widespread throughout the Greek speaking world. During the fourth century bce in Cyprus, a different script called the Cypriots. Syllabary was used between the 11th and fourth centuries bce when the Greek alphabet was finally adopted, the Greek alphabet. What eventually give rise to numerous other alphabets, including the Latin Alphabet, the Coptic Alphabet, but the Cyrillic alphabet and the Gothic alphabet ancient Greek. The adoption of the Greek alphabet took place around the beginning of the ancient Greek stage of the language, which lasted from about the ninth century bce until the fourth century bce. This stage of the language corresponds to the archaic and classical periods of Greek history, the oldest existing Greek literature and indeed some of the oldest western literature dates from this period, including the two epic poems, the Iliad and the Odyssey, which are attributed to homer.

Speaker 1:          04:37          There were various dialects of ancient Greek at the time, including attic, the dialect of Athens as well as ionic. These epic poems were written in homeric Greek, a literary form of the language based on the ionic dialect of Greek with elements of some other dialects during the classical period of Greek history. More texts of tremendous importance to Western civilization were written in ancient Greek, including the works of Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle, and many texts of foundational importance in logic, math and science. Cornay Greek with the conquest of Alexander the Great. In the fourth century bce, the Greek language became widespread in a form known as Koine Greek Qa, meaning common. It was based mainly on the attic and ionic dialects with some elements of others as well, and it served as a Lingua Franca throughout the conquered regions. It was spoken most widely in the eastern Mediterranean region. A large amount of important literature was written in Koine Greek, including the new testament and the septuagint, the Greek translation of the Old Testament Koininia Greek remains the Lingua Franca of the eastern Mediterranean region during the Roman Empire, and became the official language of the Byzantine Empire until the 15th century medieval Greek medieval Greek, also known as Byzantine Greek, developed from Koine Greek during the Byzantine Empire.

Speaker 1:          05:56          During this period, the spoken language based on coin, a Greek began to develop towards modern Greek. Wow. Written Greek tended to be more conservative and similar to ancient Greek modern Greek. The end of the Byzantine Empire marks the beginning of the modern Greek period during the modern Greek period, two forms of Grieco rose. The first was demotic or Zemo Tki, which means by the people. This is the modern spoken form of the Greek language. The second was a literary form of Greek with features of both demotic Greek and ancient Greek. This resulted in a state of dye glossier with the spoken language and the formal written language being significantly different until the adoption of demotic as the official language of Greece in 1976 that form of demotic is referred to as standard modern Greek. There are several dialects of modern Greek as well. Northern dialect, Ionian, Peloponnesian dialects, southern dialects is that Konijn all the Athenian, and there's also the Cypriot dialect spoken on the island of Cyprus with one exception, the endangered saccone and dialect.

Speaker 1:          07:00          All forms of modern Greek developed from Koine Greek. Despite this long history and it's different stages of development, the Greek language has changed relatively little compared to other languages during the same timeframe. My understanding is that speakers of modern Greek can look at an ancient Greek text and recognize a lot of familiar vocabulary, a lot of familiar words, even if they can't make sense of the sentence itself. This relative lack of change in the language is probably the result of ancient Greeks continued influence on written Greek throughout the centuries. So what is Greek like? Let's examine some of the features of Greek, specifically modern Greek syntax. There's disagreement over whether Greeks default word order is Svo or V, s o, but the most common word order is Svo. Look at this sentence here

Speaker 3:          07:46          in the Smi Lama in Unica,

Speaker 1:          07:49          this sentence means we speak Greek. Here's the subject, the verb and the object. But in Greek, the subject Pronoun is not always necessary.

Speaker 3:          07:58          Neelam aliens.

Speaker 1:          07:59          The subject pronouns isn't necessary here because we know from the verb conjugation that this is the first person plural. So if the subject Pronoun is typically used when you want to draw attention to it or make it the topic of the sentence, despite Svo being the most common word order in Greek, the words can actually be arranged in different ways. Usually to put focus on one element of the sentence. Here's a sentence that means niece loves Maria.

Speaker 3:          08:24          Oh, young niece Maria.

Speaker 1:          08:26          This sentence here is Svo and notice that the definite article comes before proper names.

Speaker 3:          08:32          Maria [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          08:34          this time it's Oh v S

Speaker 3:          08:37          oh young is demaria of a pie.

Speaker 1:          08:40          This time it's s o. V. See Maria

Speaker 3:          08:44          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          08:46          this time it's o s v. These three word orders. Here are all ways of drawing focus to the object of the sentence. It's possible to change the order of the words like this because grammatical case inflections tell us the nouns function even if it's in a different location. There are four grammatical cases in Greek, nominative, genitive, accusative, and Vocativ. Incentives is like these with proper names. The names themselves don't have case inflections, but the definite articles do notice that the two definite articles or different, we'll come back to that in a minute. Let's look at another sentence and see the nouns. Case inflection.

Speaker 1:          09:24          This sentence means I lost my new glasses word for word. It's lost I, which we know from the inflection, the new glasses, my this word, which means glasses is an inflected form of the neuter Noun, which means glass. It's the nominative, accusative and Vocativ plural form. Yes, it can be all three of those. Also, the definite article is inflected to agree with the now this is the nuture nominative, accusative plural form of the definite article. As you can see, there are several other forms of the definite article too. Let's go back to an earlier sentence. For a second. This definite article here before young niece is in the masculine singular nominative form and this definite article here before Maria is in the feminine singular accusative form. Even when the word order changed, the definite article stayed the same. Allowing us to know which person was the subject, the nominative case and which one was the object, the accusative case. Also the adjective is inflected to agree with the now this is the nuder nominative, accusative, vocativ plural form. Now let's change the noun in the sentence and see what happens.

Speaker 1:          10:39          This means I lost my new dog this time. The Noun is inflected to show the masculine singular accusative form. The definite article is also in the masculine singular accusative form and so as the adjective. The main thing I want you to notice here is that the now but also the words that come together with the now like the definite article and the adjective change form to showcase, but also gender and number verbs. Greek verbs have two different stems, two different forms. One to show perfect mood, which means an action is complete and one to show imperfect mood, which means an action is incomplete. Then various affixes particles and auxiliary verbs are added to these two stems to show past tense and non past tense. Let's examine the meaning to help. This is the perfect stem showing completed action Wli thesis, and this is the imperfect stem. Now let's look at how to create some verb tenses based on these stems. Here's the present tense voice. This means I am helping my friend and this could also mean I helped my friend. In a general sense, the present tense form is based on the imperfect stem because the action is not complete yet it's happening. Now, here's the imperfect tense, very suicidal.

Speaker 1:          11:54          This means I was helping my friend or I used to help my friend. Again, this form is based on the imperfect stem because the action was continuing at a certain point in the past. Now here's the simple past

Speaker 4:          12:05          [inaudible].

Speaker 1:          12:07          This means I helped my friend. The simple past is based on the perfect verb stem because the action is complete. Future

Speaker 4:          12:15          Savoy. You see sort of feeling

Speaker 1:          12:17          this means I will help my friend. The simple future tense is also based on the perfect stem because it's an action with a start and a finish. It's not a continuing action and the present perfect

Speaker 4:          12:29          cc [inaudible] Flores.

Speaker 1:          12:32          This means I have helped my friend many times, the present perfect. It's also based on the perfect stem, as you might've guessed from its name, because the action has been done at some point in the past. Also notice the auxiliary verb, which is the first person singular form of the verb, meaning to have. Let's look at one final Greek sentence and see what we discover

Speaker 4:          12:53          in this [inaudible].

Speaker 1:          12:57          The sentence means we fell in love and got married. Immediately. Word for word it. We fall in love, past tense. First person, plural, inflection and get married. Past tense. First person, plural. Immediately. This verb, it'll tell them it means to fall in love. This verb means to get married. This ending is the first person, plural, past tense conjugation. This piece here show us past tense and this piece shows number and person. These two verbs are not active verbs but rather medio passive verbs. You might see the word passive there and think that these are passive verbs, but medio passive verbs are not always passive. They might also be intransitive or reflexive or reciprocal. In this case, they seem to be reciprocal, meaning that both people are doing the action to each other or with each other. This ending here on the dictionary form of the verb is a hint that it's a medial passive verb.

Speaker 1:          13:50          One of the main things you may have noticed about Greek is that it's a highly inflected language with lots of different word forms and lots of different endings that can attach to nouns and to verb stems and that might seem kind of intimidating, but there are lots of languages out there that are much more inflected then Greek, so please don't be scared of that. The story of the Greek language is a very long and spectacular one and there's so much to say about Greek that we can't fit into this video, but hopefully you were a little bit inspired to learn more about Greek. One of the oldest languages in the world and a language that has influenced many other languages and the very foundations of Western civilization and thought, okay, the question of the day to native speakers of Greek, how well can you understand written Greek from the past, like Koine Greek and ancient Greek, and to people who have studied Greek? What did you find challenging and not so challenging about Greek? Be sure to follow length, focus on facebook, twitter, and instagram. And as always, I would like to say thank you to all of my wonderful patrion supporters, especially these people right here on the screen for their monthly pledges.

Speaker 2:          14:52          Thank you for watching and have a nice day.
