Speaker 1:          00:00          Hello everyone. Today I'm going to talk about language learning key number two, number two, which is phonology. This could be number one, but it just so happens that last time I talked about a kind of a general study habit consistency, but as far as practical study and practical skills of the language, golf phonology could be number one. I really think that learning the phonology of the language is one of the most important things. It's the basis of all of your studies and all of you are skills that are to come. The phonology means the system of sounds of that language, so that includes the pronunciation of the consonants and the vowels, but also the stress patterns and the intonation patterns, that kind of thing. Basically pronunciation, you could call it that same kind of thing. Now it's extremely important to learn the final logical system of each language you learned because it's really what connects you to that language.

Speaker 1:          00:50          It's the thing that associated with that language. It helps you access your integrated skills, your are synthesized skills in that language. So what I mean by that is this, if you learn a foreign language but you use your native languages pronunciation or you've just pronunciation that's quite close to your native languages pronunciation, then you're never going to fully be able to access that foreign language or access your skills in that foreign language because you'll always retreat into your native language. That funnel logical system is associated with your native language, so you want to stay away from that. You want to stay away from the phonological system of your own language and as precisely as possible, learn the phonological system of that foreign language that you are studying. In the past, before I really figured this out, I basically had a generic foreign language accent. I would use the same kind of phonology for all the different languages I learned.

Speaker 1:          01:41          It was just like I had a foreign language accent that wasn't that precise, so it kind of work that. The problem was there was some crossover between languages. So when I tried to speak one language, I would sometimes get mixed up and say words from the other language or I would retreat into it on language that I knew how to speak better because that phonology is anchored to the other language, not only the one I'm learning right now. So it's really important that you keep those languages you learn as distinct as possible in terms of phonology. So how do you learn the phonology of a new language that you are studying? Well first you have to perceive the phonology, perceive the sounds of that language, and then second you have to learn how to produce the sounds through imitation. Those are the two things. So let's focus first on perceiving the sounds.

Speaker 1:          02:25          You want to pay attention to the sounds of the language and the distinctions between all of those sounds. So every beginner's language program out there, we'll have some kind of introduction to the phonology of the language. They usually call it the pronunciation section and it will show you all of the consonants, all of the vowels in that language. And just go through the pronunciation of each one, maybe just the sound and then an example where it, so you should of course go through that. You should repeat after all the sounds, repeat after those individual words that they give as examples. But then you don't want to just go through the introductory pronunciations of that language program. That wouldn't be enough. That's just giving you a quick idea of what sounds exist. But you want to actually hear them over and over numerous times until you can perceive them right then so you can't hear them and know which sound is being said.

Speaker 1:          03:13          So it's good to listen to some examples of the language, uh, inaction. So you want to hear some radio broadcast or some TV shows or some interviews or somebodies youtube channel with them talking just like I'm talking right now, but in the target language that you want to learn. So when you hear those sounds at a natural speed, then you can start to notice and perceive those sounds that are introduced in that language textbook or on the language website. That's your learning from. If you don't take this time to listen and become familiar with the sounds of that language, then what's going to happen is you're going to start thinking of that language visually. You're going to start thinking of the language only in terms of the orthography in terms of the way it's written, and you're going to think of those letters that you see the orthography in terms of your own native languages, phonology.

Speaker 1:          03:57          So when you imagined the letters in your head, you imagine the word that you are trying to say, you're going to save the sounds as you would in your own native language. If it was spelled like that. Here in Japan, there's a big problem with this. Like I have students who learned English, but they learned it from someone who doesn't really speak English. They learned it from a Japanese teacher in high school who doesn't really speak English. They just taught it from the textbook. They'd teach them English in the Japanese phonological system, so they can't even perceive the native English sounds often. For example, if they read the word, uh, ice hockey, they'll read it as a sewer hook. Gay, or if they see the word birthday cake written in English, they will read it out loud as Butsu day cake because they are processing the language through their own phonological system.

Speaker 1:          04:43          Even if I say it, if I say birthday cake, he'll look at me like, what? But if I say boss today, KCI, they'll understand because they're not perceiving the English sounds. They're not perceiving sounds of the word in the English phonological system. They're only perceiving it if I say it in their phonological system. So that's the problem we want to avoid. So the first thing that you have to do is to learn to perceive the sounds before you produce them. The second thing you have to do is to learn to produce those sounds through imitation. So how can you do that? Well, the most basic thing you can do is to get a teacher or a tutor or someone who will work with you together closely and monitor you and give you feedback about your pronunciation, to help you to make sure that you are saying the sounds as precisely as possible so that you are off to a good start right from the beginning.

Speaker 1:          05:26          And then you don't ingrain any bad habits of using your own native languages phonology. So having a teacher or a tutor is the best way because they can give you that feedback. They can perceive distinctions in the sounds that you can't perceive yet. So it's good to have someone, they're giving you feedback and helping you along. But some of you like to study alone. You don't like to work with the teacher right away if you're working alone, if you're studying by yourself with the textbook or with some websites, you can do it. I used to do that until the past couple of years and I was always fairly good with that because I'm quite an independent learner. But it means that you will have to really monitor yourself and monitor your own pronunciation and try to continuously refine it. But you can use language cds like the CDs that come with your textbook and use that to chorus or listen and repeat after the CD you like.

Speaker 1:          06:13          You can play a a sentence and then pause it and repeat after it and try to pronounce it as closely as possible to the CD. You can do that with a lot of youtube clips to like watch some, some youtube channels or some interviews or TV shows and play short bits and pause and then repeat after it. And then when you get a bit better you can start to shadow videos or shadow audio cds and that kind of thing. So shadowing means that you try to repeat after it as they're speaking in real time, so you kind of speak right after them and try to follow them. It's easy to get lost doing that, but that's fine. You just want to be able to shadow as much as you can and get. The basic point is to continuously listen and produce the sounds. At the same time, but it's often the case that people will do a kind of hybrid of listen and repeat and shadowing.

Speaker 1:          06:58          Like they'll shadow as much as they can, but when they get lost, they'll pause the button then and try to finish repeating and then they'll unpause the button and try to continue. So that's, that's fine. You just want to continuously hear native speakers and imitate them and try to produce the same sounds that they are making as precisely as you can. So you just need to monitor yourself quite a bit if you're doing this through self study, but it can work. Also, don't forget the stress patterns and intonation patterns because even though those usually aren't the introductory sounds that you are tight in your language program, those carry a lot of meaning and they also can mean the difference between one word and another word, especially the stress patterns. The stress panners can create distinctions and meanings. So don't forget about those. Try to imitate those.

Speaker 1:          07:41          Those ones are not really conscious. I mean the, it's difficult to consciously refine them, but you just want to just pay attention to the overall patterns of intonation. Repeat what you hear, and subconsciously you're going to internalize those patterns without really thinking about it as long as you are intentionally imitating native speakers or fluid near native speakers. So that is language learning. Key number two, it is phonology. Make sure you get the basics at the phonology down quite well at the beginning before you start getting into learning all the grammar and um, doing a lot of conversation. Get the phonology down from day one. It's very important. It is the key to accessing that language and not crossing wires with different languages and not retreating into your native language. So learn the phonology and that will help you a ton. All right, this is Paul signing off and have a good
