Speaker 1:          00:00          Hello everyone, welcome to the Lange Focus Channel and my name is Paul. Today we're going to talk about a language that partially descended from English but is not actually English. The language is took piece in an English based Creole language talk. BCM is one of the official languages of Papa New Guinea, which is located in the southwestern Pacific Ocean, just north of Australia. It's other official languages are English, which is not spoken by most of the population and hedy Motu, but talk piecing serves as the most common Lingua Franca. Lingua Franca is certainly useful in Papa New Guinea since it's the most linguistically diverse country on the planet.

Speaker 1:          00:46          Okay. It's the most linguistically diverse country in the whole universe. Over 800 languages are spoken in Papa New Guinea, a country of just around 8 million people with so much linguistic diversity. Talk piecing is frequently used for communication between people of different linguistic backgrounds. Look at the name of the language. Talk pc talk means language, but it comes from the English word talk and also means talk, speech, word, message, news, etc. The majority of top piss in words come from english, but are used with different meanings or with a wider range of meanings. This word piecing comes from pigeon, but probably developed from the english word business, not in [inaudible], but rather in the chinese language talk. Pc has also sometimes been called talk boy, boy comes from boy, but actually refers to someone who was an indentured laborer, servant or slave of colonial europeans because their bosses or masters referred to them as boy talk, pissing began as a pigeon language on the plantations of german Samoa. Between 1880 and 1914 when laborers from new Guinea were brought over an english based creole in a german territory. Why? Well laborers from the Solomon Islands and from Vanuatu had already been working on plantations in the queensland colony in present day Australia, and they had already developed an english based pigeon language.

Speaker 1:          02:13          In short, they needed a common language for work, so they adopted a small english vocabulary and use the grammar of their melanesian languages to connect the words together. In this way, a melanesian english based creole language overall is in queensland. Some of these pigeons, speakers from Vanuatu, Solomon Islands later worked in german Samoa alongside the new Guinea and laborers using their pigeon as a lingua franca. People from all of these places brought the pigeon language home with them where it became widely used as a lingua franca and became crystallized, meaning that it became spoken as a native language for some people and became used for all functions of life, not only for the limited functions of the original pigeon language. Till this day, the forms of pigeon spoken in papa new Guinea and the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu are all quite though. They have definitely diverged into their own distinct varieties.

Speaker 1:          03:03          After pigeon languages become creole languages, there are technically no longer pidgin languages, but they are still referred to as pigeon in all three countries. Now let's examine talk pcn and see what it's like. Vocabulary as an english based creole language talk, pcn got most of its vocabulary from english, but words of english origin are usually pronounced differently according to the phonological rules of the austronesian languages of melanesia. For example, brother is pronounced enough in before shark suck. Stand or stand up, sun up words of english origin are also generally used differently than they are in english. For example, class from the english word place in tok pc in this means village or hometown area or region from the english word, devil means soul shadow, reflection or image plus two from english, close to means close to but also nearly or almost place months from english. Christmas means birthday and not just to christ's birthday.

Speaker 1:          04:15          Anyone's birthday. Since the vocabulary of talked pcn stems from a small english vocabulary. Oftentimes one word is used to represent a wide range of synonyms in english or a category of words, for example, gut from english got or have got this means to have or to possess. in top pc, there's just this one word from english clothes. This means clothes but also blouse or dress us. This means angry or annoyed or cross in english. Cross means mildly annoyed and many north americans might be unfamiliar with that word, but in top pc, it's the common word for all dEgrees of anger or annoyance. Two months from english, too much. This means very or very much or greatly or too much, and some words have expanded beyond synonyms to cover a wider range of meanings. Stump from english stop. This means to be located somewhere, to remain, to stay, to rest or to be in progress with this word.

Speaker 1:          05:21          It might be a bit harder to wrap your head around. It's different meanings. If you stop somewhere than you are there at that place, you are remaining there. You are staying there. You are situated there. The meaning of to be in progress stems from the meaning of remaining because the action is remaining in progress. For example, penn belong me. Stop long one. This means where is my pen? Pen of me is located at what place? Novel talk pc in vocabulary. It comes from english. Some words come from german. Since Samoa was under german control and parts of new Guinea. We're under german control. When new gideons returned, well see, this means to remove or to get rid of. This comes from german warehouse, meaning out. Cool. meet. This means rubber and comes from the german word, gloomy, musky. This means it doesn't matter. It comes from the german mcneese, which means the same thing.

Speaker 1:          06:19          Some vocabulary comes from malaya because of contact with bahasa, Indonesia on the island of new Guinea and contact with regional melia languages, so soup meaning milk. This comes from the malaysian word susu. Some words also come from portuguese because of early portuguese contact with melanesia as early as the 16th century, for example. This means to know, to understand, to know how to, to be able to, to be cognizant with or to be accustomed to. This comes from portuguese, so bad, which means to know vicky, which means child or baby comes from portuguese pecking, you know, which means little, and there are also words for many austronesian languages. Grammar. While The vocabulary of top pc in mainly comes from english, the grammar largely reflects the austronesian languages spoken by early pigeon speakers on the plantations. Let's look at a few examples here and later we'll see more grammatical features in context. The predicate marker. All third person sentences contained a predicate marker. He

Speaker 2:          07:26          plus

Speaker 1:          07:28          the village doesn't have any water word for word. This sentence is village predicate marker. No have water. The word he tells us that what comes next is the predicate, the part of the sentence telling us something about the subject and normally contains a verb in the language with a simple vocabulary and grammar. it would be easy to hear the predicate as part of the subject if there were no predicate marker place. Noga water could be understood as the village that doesn't have any water, which would leave the listener waiting for a predicate to follow because that whole phrase sounds like the subject. Next, the transitive verb marker. Iem when verbs are transitive, in other words, when they are followed by an object, the suffix him is attached

Speaker 2:          08:11          me like in two months.

Speaker 1:          08:14          This means I really liked beer. I like really beer. Liking consists of like from english, like with the transitive suffix, him. This means yesterday. I saw you on the street yesterday. I see you on street looking consists of look from english, look with the transitive suffix. Him. The sentence also contains an interesting word long, which brings me to the next point. Prepositions talk. Pissing basically has two main prepositions. One of them is long, which comes from english along. It's used to cover a wide range of english prepositions in by on with from to and have a look at this Example

Speaker 2:          08:59          all long monday, lonely.

Speaker 1:          09:03          This means they went by road on monday to lay they preposition marker go by road on monday to lay. That's the name of a city. The word old comes from english all but one of its uses is the third person plural pronoun. The other main preposition is belong, which comes from english, belong. It covers the meanings of and for and is often used to indicate possession. For example,

Speaker 2:          09:30          this fella emmy,

Speaker 1:          09:33          this is my brother's car, this predicate marker car of brother of me. Next, the adjective marker paler. The suffix pillar is normally added to single syllable adjectives when they appear before nouns, so a big tree is the law comes from english big, and then the adjective suffix is attached to it. [inaudible] is a word from one of [inaudible] austronesian, substratum languages. It's also worth pointing out that this phrase has no indefinite article talk. Pc has no definite article and know indefinite article. In other words, no equivalent of the or, but for Clarity, one pillar meaning one can be used. So this phrase could be

Speaker 2:          10:14          one pillar,

Speaker 1:          10:17          one big tree. Notice that one pillar comes from the english word, one with the adjective suffix attached to it. Okay. We've seen some of its key features, so let's look at a couple more. Talk pc and samples and break them down.

Speaker 2:          10:32          got enough money long by him. House can walk him house tussle.

Speaker 1:          10:39          This means if we don't have enough money to buy a house, we can just build a house word for word. It's if we know have enough money to buy house, we can build house. Just suPpose comes from english suppose and is used to mean if me. Pella comes from english me, which on its own would mean I, but the suffix pillar indicates that it's the plural form we belong is used here to mean for by him, comes from english by and has the transitive verb. Suffix, joachim comes from english work but means to make build or repair. Tussle means just or only it comes from english. That's all. And one more example,

Speaker 2:          11:20          and maybe know go through long syncing.

Speaker 1:          11:23          This means he got really drunk at the party or she got really drunk at the party he or she predicate marker, past tense marker, be drunk, badly, really at party m comes from english, him but is used for both male and female and for subjects and objects in the sin been comes from english being and is used as an aspect marker to show completion of an action effectively indicating past tense. In this sentence, spock comes from english, spark and means to be drunk. No good comes from english, no good, true comes from english, true and is used as an adjective or an adverb like truly or really long refers to the location of the action and sing. Sing is a reduplicate [inaudible] of the english word sing and is used to mean sing or song, but also for a ceremony involving dancing and singing or for a party.

Speaker 1:          12:16          Let's think about being again for a minute. Talk piecing verbs are basically not conjugated and the verb form is the same for all persons and numbers and times to indicate time. you can use a time word like us day, meaning yesterday to moda, etc. Or you can use an auxiliary verb that shows aspect like being which shows completion. Another option is to place penis from english, finish after the verb for the future you can use like which has the sense of is about to for things a little farther in the future. you can use the word bi or buying by. For example, by me come back, I shall return by and buying bite come from the old fashioned english expression by and by meaning after a short time. These words indicating an actions relation to time or not normally necessary. If the time is clear from the context and the adverbs of the sentence, hopefully this video and the language samples within it have given you an idea of what the seen is like.

Speaker 1:          13:16          The english roots of much of its vocabulary are obvious, but it's also obvious that talk present is not english. It's grammar is very different and even the vocabulary is generally used quite differently. Talk be seen as a language in its own right. It's used in the parliament of papa new Guinea, it's used in tv and radio broadcasts and it's used by people all over the country every day as a lingua franca. there are books written and talk, but it's still not widely used as a literary language, but there are people who think it can and should fulfill that function as well, but with english also being an official language and the language of schooling, some field that english should retain this role as the formal and literary language. The question of the day to native speakers have talked piece in. For some people it's hard to imagine how talk pcns vocabulary is sufficient for all parts of life.

Speaker 1:          14:04          Do you find that talk? Pacino is sufficient to say everything you want to say. Are there times when it's not and for other peoplE, if you want to hear some more talk pc in, I will put a link to a top pc in news broadcast in the description below.
