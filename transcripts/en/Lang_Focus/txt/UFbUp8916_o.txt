Speaker 1:          00:08          Hello everyone. Welcome to the Lange Focus Channel and my name is Paul. Today I'm going to talk about the Kurdish language, whereas Curtis Spoken, well, that's an interesting question. Kurdish is the language of the Kurdish people and ethnic group who did not have their own independent country. They mostly live in the Kurdistan region, which consists of much of southeast Turkey, northeastern Syria and northern Iraq in northwestern Iran, as well as some other isolated areas and the former Soviet Union Kurdish as the majority language spoken in those areas, there are approximately 30 million native speakers of Kurdish. That includes around 14.5 million in Turkey, 5.6 million in Iraq, 6 million in Iran and around 2 million in Syria. It also includes a Kurdish diaspora living outside of the Kurdistan region, most notably in Germany, like Persian. Kurdish is a member of the indoor running and branch of the Indo European language family, but we're as Persian belongs to the southwestern sub branch.

Speaker 1:          01:01          Kurdish belongs to the northwestern sub-branch. Persian and Kurdish share many similarities, but they're not mutually intelligible. The history of the Kurdish language is the subject of much speculation for much of its history. The Kurdish language was not a written language. Folk Tales and poetry were passed down orally from generation to generations with few exceptions. The earliest written Kurdish texts come from the 15th century and later there was one known poem from the seventh century written in the garden. He dialect, but technically the granny dialect is actually a separate language from Kurdish. Okay. Wait, this is getting confusing. Let me back up for a minute. What is the Kurdish language? Is that one unified language that all Kurdish people can understand and speak? No, not really. It's a collection of related dialects spread out across a continuum, meaning that the language changes gradually over a geographic distance.

Speaker 1:          01:49          There are three main dialect groups of Kurdish. Could Umangi Sorta Tony and pat. Hello honey. The most widely spoken is could Umangi with around 20 million native speakers. It is the major dialects spoken in Turkey as well as in Syria and some parts of Iraq and parts of Iran. The second most widely spoken is sorta knee with six or 7 million native speakers, mainly in Iraq and Iran. The third most widely spoken is hello ani, which is spoken by about 3 million people in some Kurdish areas in Iran and one district in Iraqi Kurdistan. These three dialects have a relatively low degree of mutual intelligibility, so some people consider them to be distinct languages and not just dialects of one language. The differences between these dialects have been compounded by the fact that the Kurds are spread out across several different countries and have no central media or a school system and haven't had much interaction with the other areas of Kurdistan and there has also been some influence from the official languages of the countries where they live.

Speaker 1:          02:45          Could Umangi is written in a Latin alphabet like Turkish, while [inaudible] is written in a pair, so Arabic script Atla one is written in either script on top of these main critic dialects or critic languages depending on how you look at it. There were also some other languages by some Kurds, a few million Kurds speaky. There's as that or go annie, which form a separate sub branch of the northwestern Iranian languages. They're still quite closely related to the Kurdish dialect and since they are spoken by Kurds, some people consider them to be Kurdish dialects for reasons related to cultural and ethnic identity.

Speaker 2:          03:17          Okay.

Speaker 1:          03:18          A big part of the story of Kurdish is the desire for linguistic freedom. In Turkey. The Kurdish language was heavily suppressed. For decades it was illegal to print Kurdish language materials. It was a prohibited language and government institutions and schools and in public it was prohibited to speak it even though not everyone followed that rule in public. That was the rule. These days those policies have been relaxed, but Kurds still wants certain freedoms like the right to use the Kurdish language as the language of instruction and regional schools. There was a similar situation in Syria and Iraq where the language was made illegal and heavily suppressed. From what I understand, Iran has not aggressively suppressed the Kurdish language, but they have discouraged. It's use and promoted assimilation to the Persian language. There was one country where Kurdish is an official language and that is Iraq. And there was one area where Kurds have official autonomy and that's in Iraqi Kurdistan, which is run by the Kurdish regional government. They are Kurdish is the language of instruction in schools and it's used in the media since there are speakers of both Karangi and Serani dialects in Iraqi Kurdistan, the government promotes both of them in schools and in the media. There was now also another defacto autonomous Kurdish region, and that is in Syria and Kurdistan. It is known as Brittle Java due to the civil war. The Syrian government is no longer in control of the area and all restrictions on the Kurdish language are now irrelevant. Schools have introduced a new Kurdish curriculum taught in Kurdish.

Speaker 2:          04:38          Okay.

Speaker 1:          04:38          The form of Kurdish used in Syria and Kurdistan is Kurmanji with Kurdish autonomy and Kurdish language schools now existing in both Iraq and in Syria, the curtis language might become stronger and more standardized in the future. So what exactly is Kurdish like? Well, that depends on what variety of Kurdish you're talking about. So let's take a look at both could Umangi and after that we'll look at sorta Annie. Here are a few interesting features of could Umangi could a bungee nouns are all either masculine or feminine and there are four. Now in cases it is generally an Sov language. They'll certain sentences are Svo put 'em on. Ge has something called Ergot. Tivity could Mangi has prepositions and post positions and it also has something called circle positions. Let's have a look at the nouns and their cases first could Manji has four. Now in cases nominative or bleak construct and Vocativ the case endings are different depending on the gender and number of the knelt. Here's an example with the word for men,

Speaker 2:          05:30          middle, middle of the row, v, neuro, Vicky, neuro, neuro, neuro, Vin, and the roof. Name Neuro. No.

Speaker 1:          05:42          Now here's an example of using the word for Woman Jin.

Speaker 2:          05:46          Ginny, just you know Janeka Ginny Shin, she none. Shinon Junin [inaudible], no.

Speaker 3:          05:58          [inaudible].

Speaker 4:          05:58          You may have noticed that the plural case endings are the same for both genders because it could Umangi gender applies only to singular nouns, not to plural nouns. Okay, let's look at some examples, sentences and could Umangi here we'll see. That could Umangi is generally sov.

Speaker 3:          06:12          This means I see the men,

Speaker 4:          06:15          middle one dabine him. So if we translate this sentence directly, it's like Aye man. C as equals I, middle of equals man and is the oblique case marker. And also the plural marker and to be name is c so you can see that the sentences Sov with the object coming in. The middle positions I'm quoted in, this means we are Kurdish or we are Kurds. If we tried to translate this sentence directly, it's like we Kurds are m equals, we couldn't equals curd in equals r. That's the present tense Copula. Again, we can see that this is Sov. The sentence doesn't actually have an object, but it has something called a compliment which comes in the same position as the object. Now why does the Noun in the first sentence happen? Ending on it marked in yellow, but in the second sentence there isn't one and that's because nominative case has no ending in either singular or plural and good manji.

Speaker 4:          07:08          So we only know it's plural from the context and hear the context is that the subject is we, so we know what's plural. Could Umangi exhibit something called Ergot? Tivity in ergots of languages, the subject of a verb sometimes functions as though it's the object of a sentence. It could Umangi. This happens when the verb is in one of the past tenses. The agent that is the doer of the action is in the oblique case, like an object and the patient that is the receiver of the action is in the nominative case, like a subject. The verb then takes an ending to agree with the patient.

Speaker 3:          07:41          Men, oh deet.

Speaker 4:          07:43          We would translate this as I saw him, but it's more like by me. He was seen literally word for word. It's me. He saw, but the verb ending confirms that he is actually the receiver of the action. We as dictum, this means he saw me or by him I was seeing word by word. It's him. I saw, but again, the verb ending confirms that I as the receiver of the action. So here him as the ending for the first person singular and that matches the patient of the sentence. And that's I, in this case, I find ergotism it quite difficult to wrap my head around. It's not founded most Indo European languages. It's found in Kurdish, it's found in Pashto and it's founded some of the northern Indian languages. Okay. If we want to make that last sentence negative, we simply add a negative prefix to the verb. We as Ned Itam, this means he didn't see me. This is an example of how it could Umangi uses lots of different affixes could Umangi has prepositions which come before noun phrases or pronouns and post positions which come after noun phrases or pronouns. But it also has circle positions which wraparound the noun or pronoun or the entire Noun phrase. For example,

Speaker 3:          08:52          the bed. This means in front of the bed,

Speaker 4:          08:56          Marlo Darek care. This means there's a tree in front of our house. So if we try to read the sentence word by word, it's in front house, hour of tree, there is now, I don't know if have is the part that I should have separated, but the point there is that in front of is split into two pieces and surrounds the noun phrase. Now let's look at some of those. Could Umangi sentences again and we'll compare them to some sorta nice sentences. Again, here are the sentences for ic, the men in Guzman, g as literal one dabine him in. So Danny.

Speaker 4:          09:31          Now one difference that you can see is that the preposition is different in the two different languages. So in could Umangi it's as that means I but in [inaudible] it's mean, why does it mean? Well in [inaudible] men is the first person singular pronoun in the Oblique case, like an object Pronoun while as is the nominative case. But in sort I need the pronouns have no cases. So there's just one word and that word has been another different word here is pll con, which is the word for man in I need, that's different from the could Manji word Middot van. I think this is just an alternate word for man in [inaudible] I think. And so I need the word middle of means man. More as inhuman. Now both words for men here have the ending on, but it's actually different in both languages. In could Manji it's the oblique case, plural marker.

Speaker 4:          10:16          But and so the need, there are no cases so and so donny, it's just the general plural marker. Now the sentences for we are Kurds in could Umangi quoted then and in. So Danny, now here again, we can see that the pronoun is different in the two languages. It's the first person plural pronoun. But in putting on, gee, it's m and then saw danny, it's Emma. And in both languages we have the present tense Copula in. The only difference here is the orthography and could on, gee, there's a space before the coffee love. Now the sentences for, I saw him in good Umangi men. Oh deet and in Solani mean own Dick, these sentences look quite similar. The sorani sentence has an extra m attached to the object of the sentence that m is actually an ethics representing the subject in a soda. Any pass 10 sentence.

Speaker 4:          11:06          The subject is represented as an ethics before the verb. Here the subject is also stated overtly as men, but the sentence is possible without that first word in court. Manji it's not like that. Now the sentences for he saw me in could Umangi we as dictum and in so Danny Oh money. This example is similar to the last one. We can see that the pronouns are different and Sony, because Sony has no case distinction and we can see that and put them on g. The verb has an ending that the Sadhana verb doesn't have in the chronology sentence and objects. Suffix is attached to the end of the verb. And so Dani, on the other hand, a subject affix is added before the verb and here are the sentences for he didn't see me in [inaudible]. We as [inaudible] and in Daneen. Oh [inaudible]. Now this sentence is basically the same as the last one except that it's negative.

Speaker 4:          11:58          And we can see that put them on g and Sorta knee using negation in the same way she wrote the sentences for, there's a tree in front of our house in could Umangi the bed, Marlo Medda Dora care and in saw [inaudible] that it kid Lebron Guatemala. Come on in the quarter Manji sentence. We have a circle position that wraps around the noun phrase, but in the sorta and he's sentenced, there is a preposition that comes before the noun phrase and the preposition that's totally different. And the noun phrase itself is also somewhat different. My love means house and could Umangi while model means house and sorta need and may means hour increment g one. And so donny, yet mun the egg after mal is an indefinite article which doesn't exist in [inaudible] and the [inaudible] is a connector which also isn't used in liquid laundry sentence. So as you can see there are some significant differences between couldn't Manji and sorta knee.

Speaker 1:          12:49          So which variety of Curtis should you learn? Well if you're planning on spending some time in the Kurdistan region than it would make sense to learn the variety of the place where you planned to spend the most time and in the future you could always learn to adapt and speak a different dialect. By extension is Kurdish at difficult language to learn? Well, there are some things like urgh activity that are probably challenging for people who have never encountered them before, but probably some of the most challenging things will be the dialectal variation in the language and the lack of a single standard language as well as a general lack of learning materials. On the other hand, from what I understand, if you have a previous knowledge of Persian that will help you a great deal in learning Kurdish and critics, people are also all very welcoming and friendly and very enthusiastic about helping you to learn their language and that kind of support is always very encouraging.

Speaker 1:          13:34          Okay. The question of the day for Curtis speakers, how easy is it for you to communicate with speakers of other varieties of Kurdish? And do you consider them all dialects of a single language, or do you consider them distinct languages? And for people who've studied Kurdish, what did you find challenging about the language and in general, what was your experience with the language? We'd like to hear about it in the comments down below. Definitely be sure to checkout lane, focus on twitter, on facebook, and on instagram. And again, I'd like to say thanks to all of my patrion supporters for continuing to make Lang focus possible. Thank you for watching and have a nice,

Speaker 5:          14:06          hey.
