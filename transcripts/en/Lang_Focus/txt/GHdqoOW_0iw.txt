Speaker 1:          00:00          Hello everyone, welcome to the Lange Focus Channel and my name is Paul. Today I want to start this video with a new feature called the mystery language. I'm going to play a language for you that you may have not heard before, and at the end of the video I will let you know what this language is. So check it out

Speaker 2:          00:19          a sas, then the gus and Alisa Fallon trying to date must watch away. Mislead it's live.

Speaker 1:          00:40          Okay. Stay tuned until the end of the video and I will tell you what language you just heard. Okay. Onto our main topic. What country has the most languages spoken? What country is the most linguistically diverse? Many of us come from countries where there may just be one or two main languages and maybe some other regional minority languages too, but there are some countries in the world where the amount of linguistic variation is just mindblowing. The country with the most languages spoken is Papa New Guinea with at least 820 different languages spoken. Imagined that upload. New Guinea is a very rural country where 88 percent of the people live in rural areas now compare that to 10 percent of the people in the United Kingdom living in rural areas for 19 point three percent of the American population living in rural areas. Papa New Guinea is very rural indeed and because of Papa New Guinea is rugged terrain and it's deep valleys, there's a limited amount of communication between all of those isolated rural community.

Speaker 1:          01:37          That's why they're remained such an amazing amount of linguistic variety today without any particular languages sort of growing in influence and dominating the others. You imagined that your village speaks one language and the neighboring village just a few kilometers away, speaks an entirely different language. That's sometimes the case in top one new Guinea, and I'm not even talking about different dialects of the same language, although that happens too. I'm talking about completely different languages. In certain cases, the languages of New Guinea fall into three categories. The first one is the Austronesian languages, which arrived in Papa New Guinea about 3,500 years ago. Then there are the top one languages which predate the Austronesian languages in Buffalo, New Guinea, and then there are the foreign languages and creole languages that serve as Lingua Franca. The term pop one language simply refers to languages that predate the Austronesian languages, languages that are indigenous to pop one new beginnings.

Speaker 1:          02:31          It does not mean that they are a single language family. There are actually several dozen different language families amongst the pop one languages. Some of those language families have no connection to each other and there are some language isolates. That means that there are individual languages that have no known connection to any other languages in the world. Most pop one languages are spoken by only a few hundred to a few thousand people. There are a few that are spoken by over 100,000 people. There are three official languages in Papua New Guinea. The first one is English, the second is talk piece in, and the third one is he. The to the most widely spoken is top in. It is an English creole language which arose during the colonial period, top face and is now used as a Lingua Franca, which is very important in a country with so many different languages and it is also now spoken as a native language by many people took in is less widely spoken in the southern region of couple.

Speaker 1:          03:22          We're a different language, often functions as the Lingua Franca, and that is key. The motu two is a simplified creole, have another Austronesian language called multi. Its use has been declining in recent times in favor of English and talk English is only spoken by one to two percent of the population, but it is widely used in business and it is supposedly the language of education, but if English is the language of education and only one to two percent of the people speak it, then that sounds like a pretty dodgy education system. To me. The second most linguistically diverse country in the world is Indonesia, which lives right next to Poplin. In fact, half of the island of New Guinea lies inside Indonesia. About 740 languages are spoken in Indonesia, but there was only one official language and Lingua Franca and that is Bahasa Indonesia or Indonesian. Number three is Nigeria with 516 languages spoken, but English is used as a Lingua Franca, especially in the urban areas.

Speaker 1:          04:21          I guess they need English to communicate with all those thieving oil companies. Number four is India with 427 languages. The main Lingua Franca is our Hindi as well as English, which was left behind by the British colonizers in exchange for a massively huge amounts of India's resources, and number five is the USA, which has 311 languages. Now, that may sound surprising because we think of the USA as an English speaking country, but remember that there are over a hundred indigenous languages in the USA even though many of them have a very limited number of speakers these days. There are also a couple of hundred different languages spoken by immigrants to the USA. It may be hard to wrap your head around that huge degree of linguistic diversity, especially if you are interested in one of those countries and you want to learn a language to communicate with the people there, but luckily those countries all have one or more Lingua Franca, which can help you communicate with a much larger proportion of the population from various different linguistic communities.
