Today I want to look at a linguistic phenomenon that I find interesting. It's called metathesis. The word metathesis comes from the Greek word may talk disease meaning change of position or transposition. It refers to a situation in which adjacent sounds change position in a word. For example, in English we have ask but you might have also heard acts in some dialects. You can see that the two consonants have switched places. Another example from English, we have the word asterisk which refers to this little star looking symbol away, not that one. This one. Some people pronounce it as Asterix. Another one, the prefix intro or intra is often pronounced like inter for example, introduce is sometimes pronounced introduce so you can see that the r sound and the vowel have become reversed. Another one, the prefix pre or pro is often pronounced like per for example, prescription becomes prescription. We can see examples of metathesis of side-by-sides sound switching positions in many different languages. In. What kinds of situations does this happen? Well, during the development of a language, there's sometimes a change. For example, the English word bird came from.
