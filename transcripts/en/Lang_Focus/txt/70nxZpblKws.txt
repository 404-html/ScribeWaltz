Speaker 1:          00:13          Hello everyone. Welcome to the Lange Focus Channel and my name is Paul. Today's topic is the Malay language or Bahasa Melayu as it's called in Malay. People outside of Southeast Asia may not be very familiar with Malaya, but if we include all speakers of all varieties of Malay, it is one of the top 10 most widely spoken languages in the world and when I say widely, I mean by a large number of people. It has around 77 million native speakers and around 173000002nd language speakers for a total of about $250 million speakers. Of course, different sources give different numbers, but something like that. It's spoken in Malaysia where it has around 18 point $5, million native speakers out of a population of around 32 million people. Malaysia is an ethnically and linguistically diverse place with large communities of people speaking Chinese and Indian languages as well as numerous indigenous minority languages. Everyone in Malaysia now learns Malaya at school, but some speakers of other languages either aren't fluent in Malay or they choose not to speak it very much after they graduate from school.

Speaker 1:          01:12          Singapore is another ethnically diverse place where Malays are a minority. The Malay language is spoken by around 700,000 people. There were 13 percent of the population. It has also spoken by around 266,000 people or about 64 percent of the population of Brunei. What? That. It's not an idiot. Oh yeah, sorry. In English we say Brunei. Oh my God. You slaughtered the word Bruny. Okay. I'm Bernay. So like I was saying, it's spoken by around 266,000 people or 64 percent of the population of ru. It has also spoken by around 1 million people in southern Thailand adjacent to peninsular, Malaysia and Malaya spoken by around 11 point two, 3 million people in Indonesia. But that's only part of the story. There were also about $43, million native speakers of Bahasa, Indonesia and around 155 second language speakers have Bahasa Indonesia. So what's Bahasa Indonesia? Well, when speaking of the Malay language, we need to distinguish between Malaya dialects, which vary from place to place and the standardized forms of the language, the first standardized form of the languages, but has some value which is used in Malaysia, Brunei, and Singapore, and functions as an umbrella language for all of them.

Speaker 1:          02:19          Malaya dialects that are spoken there. The second standardized form of the language is Bahasa Indonesia. It is used in Indonesia and functions as a Lingua Franca between speakers of different languages because there are hundreds of languages in Indonesia. I planned to focus specifically on Indonesia and in a different video in the future. This is interesting in Malaysia, the official name of Malaya is Bahasa Malaysia, meaning the language of Malaysia. Instead of Bahasa Melayu, which means the language of the Malays. This name was chosen to show that the language is a language for all Malaysian citizens and not only for ethnic malaise, but some people want to change the name. Back to Bahasa Melayu history. Malaya is the most widely spoken language in the Austronesian language family. The Austronesian can most likely be traced back to a common ancestor, Prodo Austronesian in what is now Taiwan around 5,200 years ago, various dialects of rose from protocol Austronesian, one of them being Polynesian, which began splitting up into various languages around 4,000 years ago as Austronesian people expanded to the south from Taiwan.

Speaker 1:          03:17          The Malayan Polynesian sub branch includes most of the Austronesian languages outside of Taiwan, a Prodo maleic language, the ancestor of all Malaya dialects probably originated on the island of Borneo more than 2000 years ago before it speakers migrated west to Sumatra and the Malay peninsula old Malala, the beginning of the common era. And by that I mean after the year one ce or one add same thing. By the way, was a time of great Indian influence in the region and during this time old Molay, he merged. It was highly influenced by Sanskrit and written in Indian scripts like hot lava, the oldest known inscriptions of old Malaya, the Kudu come Buki, which were found in Sumatra and date back to the seventh century ce, the oldest old mill, a manuscript that still exists today is the 10th of June, Tonna, a legal text from the 14th century still before Islam was widespread in the area, classical Malay.

Speaker 1:          04:06          Islam soon became dominant in the area and trade with the Muslim world, increased, resulting in a lot of Arabic and Persian vocabulary entering the language and resulting in the adoption of the script. John [inaudible] is a version of the Arabic script that was modified to suit the Malay language during the Malacca sultanates, which was like a kingdom and its successor, the Johor Sultanate. Malaya became widely used as a Lingua Franca. During this time, Islamic literature greatly affected the language with more Arabic and Persian vocabulary entering Malaya, and because Malacca was a busy international port with people from various countries, Malaysia also absorbed vocabulary from different languages, Tamil and Chinese languages. During this classical malaise period, Malaya evolved into something relatively similar to the Bahasa Melayu and Bahasa Indonesia have today. There were actually two forms of melee that became widespread during this time period. First, there was the formal classical malave, which was the state language and the language of courts and literature, and there was bizarre Malaya or Malaysia Passata, a low language spoken by traders as a Lingua Franca.

Speaker 1:          05:06          Throughout the archipelago bizarre Malaya is thought to have been a pigeon language featuring vocabulary from Malaya, but influenced by other languages such as Chinese languages, and there will also local Malaya dialects that varied from place to place. Premodern molay. In the 19th century, European colonial powers were dominating the region with the Dutch in Indonesia and the British and Malaysia. During this time period, improvements to the printing press made Malaya books and newspapers more widely available to the common people so that literary Malay or classical ballet was no longer just the language of the courts and the elite, the literary Malaya of the Malacca and the Johor Sultanates. In other words, classical ballet was recognized by the British and the Dutch as the standard form of the language and became the language of education. One notable change during the colonial period was the adoption of the Roomi writing system, the use of Roman characters to write molay instead of the script and English loan words began to trickle into Malaysia and the areas under British control.

Speaker 1:          06:03          Modern Malaya, the abundance of Malaya literature in the 19th century sparked new enthusiasm for the language and Malaya linguists began their efforts to standardize and modernize the language. In 1936, the Malays scholars, the above, published a series of books called Alita Bahasa, in which he updated the grammar of classical ballet forming the basis of Bahasa Melayu in Bahasa, Indonesia. In both Malaysia and Indonesia, the standard form of Malaya became an important part of their respect of nationalist movements and their struggle for independence. When Indonesia declared independence in 1945, Bahasa, Indonesia became the national language and when Malaysia became independent in 1957 Bas, I'm ally. You became the national language dialects. Bahasa Malaysia was the standard form of Malaya used in Malaysia and Singapore and then Bruni, and it's the form of the language taught in schools, but there are numerous spoken dialects of Malaya that very not only from country to country but also from state to state and from town to town with differences in pronunciation and vocabulary.

Speaker 1:          06:59          The Malays spoken at Saba and what tends to be more similar to that spoken in Brunei and Singapore, but different from the dialects in west Malaysia and some states in west Malaysia are known for being quite divergent. For example, the dialects of Colombia, Colombian borders, Thailand to the north where a similar dialects spoken. The differences that in on everyone learns standard Malaya at school, but in southern Thailand everyone learns tie at school. This makes cross dialect communication harder for speakers of Malaysia and Thailand, but for speakers of other Malaya dialects, Standard Malaysia's a unifying force and speaking a little more formally can help people bridge communication gaps. Standard Malaya is also the form of Malaya learned by non malaise at school. So Standard Malaya, sometimes the language of inter ethnic communication though some people choose to speak English instead. So what is my lay like? Like most Austronesian languages, Malaya is not a tonal language. It has simple phonology and every written character represents only one sound. In most cases. It has a simple Svo sentence structure, for example,

Speaker 2:          07:56          right? Yeah. Mark can tell you

Speaker 1:          07:58          meaning, I eat vegetables, I don't eat meat. Now let's add a modal verb.

Speaker 2:          08:04          So yeah, not my.

Speaker 1:          08:07          I don't want to eat meat.

Speaker 2:          08:08          So yeah, that's not my conducting. I told me no Zuzu.

Speaker 1:          08:12          I don't want to eat meat or drink milk. Malaya grammar is simple. First of all, there's no grammatical gender. There are also no noun cases. There was also no plural form in Malaysia. If you want to make a plural explicit, you reduplicate the word or repeat the word.

Speaker 2:          08:30          Oh

Speaker 1:          08:31          means a person

Speaker 2:          08:32          all around, all around

Speaker 1:          08:34          means people. And speaking of autumn, fun fact. Ordnung means person in Malaysia who done means forest in Oregon. Cooten means forest person, also known as Orangutang. Cool.

Speaker 1:          08:49          If you want to modify a noun, you add the modifying word after the Noun, the word for book book. Cool. Now let's add a demonstrative pronoun to that book or with a possessive Pronoun Crusader my book or Buku Buku saying my books or with an adjective inexpensive book. In Malaysia, there is no copy of the verb to be at least in regular speech and there is no definite or indefinite article, so we could also mean the book is expensive, but to be more clear, you might say prepositions in Malaya are very straightforward and intuitive, so yeah, but I tell Daddy, can I come from Canada? Now I want to go to the night market at dot. There was a discount for students in this sentence. Other means there is one of the things that makes learning my life fund is that there are no verb conjugations. The form of the verb stays exactly the same regardless of whether it's in present tense, past tense or future tense.

Speaker 1:          09:49          So we have the verb meaning to eat in present tense on in past tense, in future tense. Mock on the tents is determined by specifying a time period like goodman he will eat later or by using an adverb before the verb game. He will eat, he already ate or her down. He is currently eating what he's eating now and there are some other adverts like this, but of course it's not quite that simple because we have the verb game to eat, but we also have the verb Dema came to be eaten and they're going to be eating accidentally and we have the verb moment came to consume. Then we have moma tend to feed something to someone. These are examples of one of my most challenging features for learners. It's system of building words from roots and affixes up above. We created some new verbs, but we can also create other types of words, not Kenyan food.

Speaker 1:          10:47          Matt gain someone who eats, so boomer. Nagging means a mediator. Malaya makes extensive use of this kind of affixation. Let's look at one more example of using the root word [inaudible], which means to teach. I didn't teachings to learn to teach again, to be taught in transitive, as in I'm being taught be a gay gain, transitive as in the lesson is being taught to study, to be studied by student, but now gay teacher, Bombilla, Gauteng, learning bird to be educated. All of these affixes might seem overwhelming at first, but they're fairly systematic and once you get used to the function of all of the different affixes, then it helps you to understand words that you've never heard before and it helps you to guess how to say words that you don't know yet.

Speaker 1:          11:40          Standard Malaya is a very user friendly language for learners, especially if you're used to learning more complex languages. The biggest challenge that you'll likely face as the difference between the formal language and the casual language and the dialectal variation that you'll especially different pronunciation, but by learning the standard polite form of malaria, you form a good basis for communication and you can learn the more colloquial style of communication as you go. Stay tuned for a future episode in which I cover Bahasa, Indonesia, and they'll focus in on that form of Malays specifically.
