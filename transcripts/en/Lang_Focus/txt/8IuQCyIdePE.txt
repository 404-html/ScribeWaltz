Speaker 2:          00:06          Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:08          Hello everyone. Welcome to the Lange Focus Channel and my name is Paul. Today's topic is Haitian Creole, the most widely spoken creole language in the world. Haitian creole is the main language of Haiti, mainly in the Western one third of the island of Hispaniola with the rest of the island belonging to the Dominican Republic. It's spoken by somewhere around 12 million people including the 10.6 million people of Haiti and Haitian immigrants living in the United States and Canada, France, and various Caribbean countries. Haitian creole is a young language that developed in the 17th and 18th centuries. It's a French based creole language, meaning that the vast majority of its vocabulary, around 90% of it comes from French, but it's grammar is mainly rooted in west African languages. It's sentence structure is said to be very similar to the phone language of Benito. How did this combination of elements take place? Well a French colony and part of what is now Haiti.

Speaker 1:          01:05          The island of Tortuga was founded in 1660 and a few years later, the French west India company took control of the colony and France claimed authority over the western part of Hispaniola in 1697 Spain, which had previously controlled the entire island seated the western portion of the island to France in exchange for French promises to suppress acts of piracy against Spanish ships and talents. The pirates were a lawless community of French, Dutch, and Englishman called the buccaneers. They attacked Spanish ships and talents with the support of rival European powers. These people with a real pirates of the Caribbean, but I digress. In the French colony, settlers founded tobacco, cotton and cocoa farms and African slaves were imported to work them. Almost all of Haiti's present day population descended it from such slaves. The French colonialists spoke various nonstandard dialects of French. While the slave spoke various west African languages.

Speaker 1:          02:01          It's thought that the gay languages, a branch of the Nigeria, Congo language family were spoken by a large proportion of the slaves with slaves very often unable to communicate with each other or with their slave masters. They tried to learn French, but without formal training or education, they developed a French based pigeon language. A pigeon language is a simplified form of communication that arises when people with no common language attempt to Communicate Pidgin languages have no native speakers. When a pidgin language begins to be spoken as a native language by people born in that environment, it becomes a creole language. Whereas pigeons are simplified forms of communication and may be limited in function. When they become creole languages, they increase in complexity and can be used for all functions of life. Haitian creole is a fully functional language. If you want to learn more about pigeons and creoles and how they develop, check out my video on the subject right here.

Speaker 1:          02:55          There are also other influences on Haitian creole, aside from French and African languages. Contact with other Europeans brought some Spanish, Portuguese and English words into the language. There were also frequent slave revolts and slaves escaping into the mountains, encountered the native title people. This contact introduced some Thai, no words into Haitian creole. Haiti gained independence from France in 1804 but French remains for the prestige language for the next 200 years. The government conducted business and French and French was officially the only language of education until fairly recently. Haitian creole was considered a corrupted form of French language of low prestige, the language of the poor, but that stigma didn't stop patient creole from developing as a living language. At the end of the 18 hundreds literature in Haitian creole was already being written even though there was no standard way of writing the words. In the 1940s the president of Haiti made an attempt to standardize Haitian creole orthography with the kind of phonetic spelling system, but this met with a lot of resistance because some people support it or orthography.

Speaker 1:          03:59          That was more based on the way French's written. In 1979 patient creole was finally standardized using a compromise between those two approaches. Haitian creole finally became a national language alongside French. In 1987 before that school instruction had always been in French, which was basically a foreign language for most of the students. When Haitian creole became a national language, it was allowed to be used as a tool of education in schools alongside French, which was still officially at the language of instruction. I guess this change allowed schools to switch between French and Haitian creole. Whenever that made instruction easier. French used to be the language of official radio and TV broadcasts, but in the years since Haitian creole became a national language, both languages are used. The major newspapers are all in French, but it seems that nobody really reads them except people from the upper class.

Speaker 1:          04:52          In Haiti, there seem to be two main linguistic communities to bilingual upper classes and the masses who mostly speak only Haitian creole, they'll maybe they understand some French as well because of their schooling. So what does Haitian creole like as a French based creole? It's connection to French is immediately obvious. When you look at a Haitian creole sentence. Most of the words are a French origin, but they're spelled quite differently than they are in French. The French word of it is our vet in Haitian creole don't say is Dusey. Mogi is my ga. A state is ash. Mitzi is messy. Bull Swab year is Boswami c so you can see that Haitian creole use a simpler largely phonetic spelling of French words. You should clarify meaning I work is went through Advi. The subject Pronoun here is interesting because the Haitian creole word for eye comes from the French disjunctive pronoun more rather than just the subject pronouns.

Speaker 1:          05:54          In Haitian creole, there is no distinction between the object and disjunctive pronouns. It's just when, except for a short form we'll see a bit later. Here's another example of how French words are often used differently in Haitian creole. This means I know how to cook word for word. It's I know make food when comes from Wa. Colin comes from net, comes from fair and mulching comes from French. Mosaic in friendship would be very different. You just say queasy name. First of all, in French there are two verbs, meaning to know Clinica and seth. La Coleman means to know in the sense of being acquainted with someone or something while Steph Safwat is used when you know how to do something or know something by heart in the French sentence, savoir is used, but in the Haitian creole sentence, the word column deriving from [inaudible] is used. My Ga means to eat in Haitian creole, but it also means food.

Speaker 1:          06:57          Samarin g means to make food or cook in French, you could say shaft in the Nicu, which means to make food with new Leq, meaning food mosaic doesn't mean food and French. These kinds of changes in meaning or usage of French words are common in Haitian creole personal pronouns. Before we saw the pronouns, which means I or me, the other personal pronouns are similarly of French origin but are a little different from their French equivalents. Ooh, Noo Noo you'll notice that no is used for we but also for you in the plural form, which is distinct from French, which uses [inaudible]. Not New yogurt means they, and this one may not look like a French Pronoun, but it comes from the French disjunctive Pronoun. All of these pronouns stayed the same whether they are used as subject pronouns or object pronouns. When their menu, this means I liked them, you'll learn memory.

Speaker 1:          07:56          This means they liked me. There are however short forms of the pronouns which are used in certain situations, possession to show possession. You simply place the personal pronoun after the now leavell. This means your book with the first word leave meaning book and Ou is the personal pronoun for you in the singular word order the basic word order of Haitian creole as Svo. Similar to an English or in French where Colin Geo machine meaning I drive a car. Here's the subject, the verb and the object and yellen is the indefinite article. Adjectives are usually placed after the now on machine. This means I drive a red car, but there is a limited number of adjectives that come before the noun verbs. Now let's see what happens to this verb when we change the subject of the sentence. [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          08:51          nothing happens. There are no verb conjugations and Haitian. The verb doesn't change based on gender, person or number. What about tenses? Verb tenses are indicated by adding a tense marker before the verb is the present. Continuous marker. Tay Is the past. Marker. Dot is the past. Continuous marker is the future tense. Marker is the near or definite future marker and uh, is the conditional marker. No Eileena magazine know this means we go to the store, not pollyanna magazine. This means we are going to the store. And notice here that the personal pronoun is the short form. The short forms of the personal pronouns are generally interchangeable with the long forms, but before op and the short form is normally used. Nuclear Eileena magazine. This means we're going to the store in the sense of a near or definite future action. Medallian magazine. This means we went to the store and so on.

Speaker 1:          09:55          It's really that simple. You just stick the tense marker before the verb definite articles. Let's take a look at this word for a moment. This is a definite article which always comes after the noun. It modifies. But this is not the only definite article. The definite article changes depending on the final syllable of the noun that proceeds it. If the noun ends with any of these combinations of letters or a nasal vowel like this one in magazine, the article is if the noun ends in an oral consonant that is proceeded by an oral vowel. The article is not, for example, leave la the book. If the noun ends in an oral consonant proceeded by a nasal vowel, the article is like Barranquilla the bank. If the noun ends in an oral vowel proceeded by an oral consonant, the article is, for example, a the country.

Speaker 1:          10:49          If the noun ends in a nasal consonant, the article is not, or for example delish the telephone questions. Yes or no questions can be formed by using rising intonation or you can place escape at the beginning. We'll violations as skilled highly sean shit. Sk comes from French ESCA. Open ended questions can be made by placing a question word at the beginning before the subject you [inaudible]. This means what are you eating? Chiesa means what? The first piece, key means, which and is combined with a second piece. The Pronoun for this or that other question. Words are also formed with Pete. Do you go through our visa? This means where do you live or more literally, where are you living? Because up indicates present continuous [inaudible] means were and comes from which plus place humiliate. This means who are you? Jeevan means who and the two pieces are which plus person a couple of more sentences.

Speaker 1:          11:59          Sassy. She actually, amway is fascist shim way. This means that is my brother's dog in this as my dog word for word. It's this or that is dog brother my and this or that is dog mine. The word saw means either this or that. So when this case we have two different dogs, the meaning of this or that would depend on which dog you gesture towards. Say is the Copula verb like to be, and you can see how possession is shown for amway means my brother because I comes after brother and then this whole phrase comes after the word for dog. So it's my brother's dog by guy. Give him one reason. We see clear, don't we by money. This means the thing I need is the key. Please give it to me word for word ets thing. That's I need the is key. The please give me it here.

Speaker 1:          12:56          You can see that the word k creates a relative clause. The thing that I need the definite article modifies the entire proceeding phrase thing that I need here. Bond is one of the only Haitian creole verbs that has conjugations, but there are only two forms, ball and Bob here you can see that the indirect object comes right after the verb and the direct object leap comes after the indirect object. As you can see, Haitian creole is a very fun and interesting language and if you already know some French then it will probably be quite interesting to examine Haitian creole and see how it's similar and different to French. And that brings me to the question of the day to Haitian creole speakers. Does your knowledge of creole help you understand French and to French speakers?
