Speaker 1:          00:12          Hello everyone. Welcome to the Lange Focus Channel and my name is Paul. Today we're going to focus on a language called Katelyn. Katelyn is a member of the Occidental Romance Branch of the Romance Language family. It's mainly spoken in and around Catalonia and autonomous community in spin as well as in another autonomous community, the Balearic islands, and also in the autonomous community of Valencia. But some people will definitely dispute that many members of the Valencian community will insist that they speak a separate language called Valencia and others, including most linguists, simply considered Valencian to be a collection of cattle and dialects.

Speaker 2:          00:54          Amanda,

Speaker 1:          00:58          um, okay, let's leave that issue aside for now. But in any case, in all three of those autonomous communities cancel on his co official with Spanish, except in Valencia where it's co official, a Spanish under the name Valencian. Oh Man. This video just started and I've already got a headache. Cattle land has also spoken in the tiny principality of Endora, which is located in the Pyrenees mountains and is bordered by France to the north and Spain to the self. Kendall land has also spoken across the border in France, in the northern Catalonia region. Cattle land is closely related to Oxytocin, which is spoken in areas of France adjacent to northern Catalonia. In the past, Katelyn and oxidant were considered to be dialect groups of the same language, but they're now widely considered to be independent. Sister languages have the same Occidental Romance branch. Katelyn has also spoken in the town of [inaudible] ghetto in Sardinia, Italy.

Speaker 1:          01:53          Katelyn is spoken by over 10 million people, some of whom indisputable. He speak it as a native language and some of whom speak another language at home, usually Spanish, but are also fluent in cattle land and speak at at a native level because of their environment. It's the sixth most spoken romance language after Spanish, Portuguese, French, Italian, and Romanian. It's also the most spoken nonstate language in Europe, meaning that it's the most spoken language. That's not an official language at the national level. That's because it's not official at the national level in Spain, even though millions of people speak it, it's only official in endora. Some people want it to be the official language of a new country called Catalonia that would be separate from Spain.

Speaker 1:          02:37          Tell you what, you can just google it and history like all romance languages. Katelyn developed from dialects of vulgar Latin in areas that had been under the control of the Roman Empire. The earliest form of oxytocin or romance, no one has old oxy 10 or old provence owl had developed by the eighth century and later some of its varieties began to diverge into old Katelyn. Between the 10th and 14th centuries. In the 12th century, the county of Barcelona, I can't, Deland County formed a dynastic union with the Kingdom of Aragon, forming the crown of our goal and other Catalan counties formed the Principality of Catalonia together with Barcelona, bringing them into the crown. The crown of our gone expanded under the rule of James the conqueror, who brought Valencia and the Balearic islands under the crown's control, and these became Catalan speaking areas. The political capital of the crown of our goal was the city of Zaragoza in the Kingdom of are gone, but the defacto economic and cultural centers where Barcelona and Valencia both Kavalan speaking cities.

Speaker 1:          03:39          By the 14th and 15th centuries, the crown of Aragona had greatly expanded to include Corsica, Sardinia, Sicily, and Naples. And for a brief time, Athens and Nail Patras. In present day Greece, there was a large cancel land commercial presence throughout the Mediterranean region and the Catalan language became widespread, at least amongst the commercial class. Catelynn was considered one of the great languages of Europe. But in 1479 the crown of Aragon formed a union with the crown of Casteel and Castilian today also known as just the Spanish or espanol, began to grow in influence and cancel and began to decline an influence. During much of the period from the 16th century to the 20th century, various laws were enacted that limited the use of cattle and in official documents and publications in administration and in schools. But since 1975 it has been made co official in Catalonia, Valencia and the belly, Eric Islands and in Catalonia schools are now required to teach most subjects in Catalan.

Speaker 1:          04:39          In Valencia, there's less instruction and catelynn known officially there as Valencian by the way, but there are current government efforts to increase it in the belly. Eric Islands, at least 50% of the students schooling must be conducted in Katelyn. Though there are also programs that are taught entirely in Katelyn, all of the cattle land speaking autonomous areas of Spain or bilingual with Catalan speakers also being Spanish speakers. So what's Catalan like? Once you learn one romance language, you've already taken a great step towards understanding the others. If we look at a list of basic greetings and capsule, then there will definitely be some words that speakers of other romance languages will recognize immediately. Good morning or good day on the, ah, that sounds an awful lot like Portuguese, Bom, Dia and Spanish. Buenos Dias. Good afternoon [inaudible] compare that with Portuguese and Spanish. When I started this. Good evening or good night.

Speaker 1:          05:36          Bye [inaudible] compare that with Portuguese were annoyed that in Spanish when us no chess and an Italian good night would be worn or not dare to say by you might say or they'll compare that to Portuguese. Are they all Spanish and French? Add you and if you want to be more formal you might say, compare that with French oak of Wa. Now let's look at some cattle and sentences and examine some of the languages. Basic features, many of which are quite similar to other romance languages but with some differences of course of Zeb is in bumper fussell. This means Joseph is a good teacher. Oh, Giussep is in bumper. Fussell word for word. It's the Joseph is a good teacher. This sentence follows basically the same word order you would find in other romance languages and an English with one difference. The definite article all before the name Joseph in Catalan, a definite article is used before people's first names and this is called the personal article.

Speaker 1:          06:37          We'll come back to definite articles in a minute. This whole sentence is masculine, singular, like other romance languages, cantillon nouns, articles and adjectives are inflected for grammatical, gender and number. Let's look at a similar feminine sentence. Laser Velez and I want to prefer Sota. Isabel is a good teacher, let of is and I want to prefer soda. Feminine nouns generally and in a and the adjectives that modify them are inflected with a feminine ending a as well. While masculine nouns generally end in a consonant or an o or I. One other thing I want to point out here is that the letter R is silent in the final position in Katelyn, so this word professoral ends in a vowel sound. There are basically four definite articles. The singular forms are all and la, which changed to look with an apostrophe. If the following word starts with a vowel or an h, the plural forms are us and less for the personal article.

Speaker 1:          07:33          There are the alternate forms and not with an apostrophe before a vowel or an h. The indefinite articles are we not wounds and Eunice, the way articles work in Catelynn is similar to another romance languages, but the forms are different of course, and there are also some dialectal differences in Catalan articles. Another sentence it yes, and but of the animals. Dot. This means she always has lunch very late, a simpler the animal dot word for word, it's, she always has lunch very late. One thing I'd like to point out right off the bat is this phrase molded in Spanish. It would be week dot. A day in Portuguese it would be winter [inaudible]. In Italian it would be [inaudible] quite similar to the candyland phrase, but in the other languages, words tend to end in vowels, especially in Italian. Words end in consonants much more often than Katelyn, but also pay attention to the continents.

Speaker 1:          08:28          At the end of these words. Here we see the simplification of final consonant clusters. T is often not pronounced after another consonant at the end of a word, especially in the combinations of Lt, rt, nt and St. Sometimes it may be pronounced slightly or articulated but not released and in final position, the letter d is pronounced as to but similar to t it's often silent or unreleased after another consonant. Simplification of final consonant clusters is a prominent feature of Cadillac, but it does not always happen and it varies depending on the dialect. The speaker in the samples speaks a central Catalan dialect. Here we have a personal pronoun as the subject of the sentence. This is actually not necessary. Cantillon is a pro dropped language, meaning that the subject pronouns can be dropped because person a number are clear from the verb conjugation like other romance languages.

Speaker 1:          09:23          Katelyn has two types of personal pronouns, strong pronouns, which are used as subject pronouns and after prepositions. The only difference being in the first person singular and there are weak pronouns, which are clinics that are used for the direct or indirect object. Cattle then has more weak pronoun forums than other major romance languages. Just a note about this word [inaudible] in this sentence it's pronounced as the na because in Catalan d is pronounced as the soft, the sound between vowels. Even though the D is in the initial position here it is affected by the vowel at the end of the previous word did not is irregular verb meaning to have lunch and here it's conjugated in the third person singular for the present tense. Katelyn has three categories of regular verbs which are characterized by different endings. Verb ending in Ar, also known as the first conjugation verb ending in our e or er, the second conjugation and verbs ending in irr.

Speaker 1:          10:21          The third conjugation verbs in each category have the same or similar conjugations. Another sentence, mother nothin's [inaudible] this means he gave me the money this morning, mother, not those dienes I couldn't Mati word for word. It's to me has given the masculine plural money this morning. The first word ma is a week Pronoun, which is used for the indirect object here. This form of the Pronoun m apostrophe comes before vowels and the letter h while before consonants. It's m as in m. Notice that it comes before the verb. Other not is the perfect form of the verb do na the perfect form includes the auxiliary verb of a followed by the past participle. It's used for events in the recent past and events within timeframes that are connected to now like this month or this year. There are parallel tenses in other romance languages and cattle and system of verb tenses in general is very similar to other romance languages.

Speaker 1:          11:18          Do not is another example of a Catalan word ending in a continent where it would end with a vowel in other romance languages. In Italian, this would be a little bottle and in Spanish it would be the model in Romanian, however it would be donut. Next, notice the masculine plural definite article because the word for money, dns is plural. The word a kid is similar to Italian Cuesta or Spanish and Portuguese Esta, but notice that the s and t are pronounced differently. The S is silent in the tea is not released. Mati is similar to Italian Martina or French natal. Coming back to the week pronouns for a minute. What if we want to use a pronoun in place of [inaudible]? Whether or not that can mati the direct object in this case, oh, meaning it must come after the indirect object week. Pronouns come after the verb.

Speaker 1:          12:10          In the case of imperatives, at least positive imperatives, jurrens and infinitives, so the imperative sentence give it to me would be gona move another sentence. It is about going to the AFI. Those ans this means he graduated two years ago. Word for word. It's reflexive Pronoun. He graduated, makes two years. Remember that the subject Pronoun l is probably not necessary. Let's look at the end of the sentence first. This phrase here, Father's ons shows the use of the verb fe meaning to make to tell how much time has passed since then event happened. This is similar to how it would be expressed in Italian. Do a on the far as about a lot of the work is a past tense construction called the pair of rustic past that is unique to Katelyn. It consists of an auxiliary verb related to but not identical to the present tense of the verb.

Speaker 1:          13:00          ONA meaning to go followed by a verb in the infinitive. The pair of frantic past is identical and meaning to the simple past which is now normally limited to literary use. Note that the reflexive pronoun in a different form can appear after the verb instead if it's an infinitive or an imperative or general. So this could also be boggled of the water sup and the whole sentence could be a bug. A lot of the water [inaudible]. This verb construction is somewhat surprising to me because it looks quite similar to the paraphrase stick future. Using anon out of the waterside means he is going to graduate with va being the third person singular present tense of ONA. This [inaudible] future form is used lefts and Katelyn. Then in some other romance languages probably because it resembles the pair of frantic past. So instead the simple future can be used as a good of the water.

Speaker 1:          13:52          He will graduate in Catalan. You typically formed the simple future tense by adding a suffix to the infinitive form, but for some irregular verbs there is a different future stem, not the infinitive. In general, the way the cattle and verbs are conjugated is quite similar to other romance languages except that the exact forms are somewhat different with Western romance languages in general. If you speak one or if you've studied one than the other, seems somewhat familiar right off the bat, but on the other hand, everything seems somewhat different as well. There's some different vocabulary, different phonology, some different grammatical features and sometimes things are just expressed differently. Being previously unfamiliar with Katelyn for the most part, what strikes me is that I noticed features that are similar to Spanish to French, to Italian, to Portuguese into Romanian, but I would never confuse it with one of those languages because it has its own unique elements as well.

Speaker 1:          14:45          The question of the day for speakers of Katelyn, what other romance languages do you find closest to Katelyn? Can you communicate with Occitan speakers easily or Italian speakers, et Cetera, and for speakers of other romance languages? How familiar does Catalan seem to you? What differences stand out to you? Special thanks to my friend Pablo who helped with the audio samples for this video. He's from the Catalonia region of Spain and he's fluent in Catalan, Spanish, English, Japanese, and I believe some other languages too. And he's a brilliant guy. In general. If you're studying Spanish or if you want to study Spanish, I recommend you check out his channel, dreaming Spanish, where you can learn Spanish using his unique approach to language learning.
