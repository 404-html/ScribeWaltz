Speaker 1:          00:00          Hello everyone, welcome to the Lange Focus Channel and my name is Paul. Thank you for watching and have a nice day. Mickey, what? What do you want? What do you mean that's wrong? I say that in every video. Oh, right.

Speaker 1:          00:31          Cut. [inaudible]. Hello everyone. Welcome to the Lange Focus Channel and my name is Paul. Today's topic is why does Portuguese sound like Russian? Yeah. Oh, be quiet. So why am I even asking that question? Well, a lot of people hear Portuguese and it's usually the Portuguese spoken in Portugal rather than Brazil or elsewhere and they think it sounds Russian or Slavic Russian being a slavic language. Of course, most of the people who say this are people who don't speak either language, but just think that something about Portuguese sounds Russian without really being able to describe why. Now I'm sure that a lot of Portuguese speakers and Russian speakers will say that that's ridiculous. They sound nothing alike, but I've even heard native speakers of Russian say that they think Portuguese sounds Russian and I've heard native speakers of Polish as well say that they think Portuguese sounds like Polish.

Speaker 1:          01:23          Let me be clear that they are not saying that Portuguese is mutually intelligible with Russia or with any other Slavic language. It's not at all. What they do say is that if they hear Portuguese being spoken at a distance but they aren't close enough to hear what's being said, or if they're not really paying attention to what's being said, then they think it sounds like Russian or Polish, and I've heard the same thing in reverse from European speakers of Portuguese. If they hear Russian or another Slavic language from a distance, they might think that it sounds like Portuguese, so how can that happen? Well, it's because of some similar elements in there. Phonology, stress, timed languages. One important similarity between Portuguese and Russian is that both of them are stressed timed languages in a stress timed language, the length of time between stressed syllables remains relatively consistent and in order to fit into that fixed time interval, unstressed syllables become compressed and shortened.

Speaker 1:          02:16          This results in a lot of vowel reduction. European Portuguese contains quite an extreme amount of vowel reduction. For example, done form. This means I'm hungry. You can see that the sounds old is reduced or a Schwab and the sound is reduced form. Another example, important again, the old is reduced and a is reduced to or basically disappears important and there's similarly a lot of vowel reduction in Russian. For example, Uber. Look, this word means cloud. The off is reduced to a Schwab and old is also reduced to a Schwab. Another example, subpart d, this word means boots. You've probably noticed the reduction in these two vowels right here, so buggy, Russian and other Slavic languages also have a lot of consonant clusters and because of the heavy vowel reduction in European Portuguese, it ends up having more consonant clusters than other romance languages. Here's a Portuguese example.

Speaker 1:          03:19          This means to despise. This is a consonant cluster with four consonants which results from the dropping of the evil app for consonants is an extreme example, and three is more common, and here's a Russian example split. This means splash. This cluster also has four consonants, split risk in addition to the vowel reduction, the stress timing results in a similar rhythm, a similar cadence in contrast with stress times languages, there are also syllable timed languages in syllable timed languages. Each syllable lasts for a more or less equal duration of time. Other romance languages are much more syllable time to then Portuguese, which gives it its different cadence and it's vowel reduction. It's interesting to note that Brazilian Portuguese, which has weaker stress timing than European. Portuguese is often said to sound more like Spanish than European. Portuguese does, but there are lots of stress timed languages including English, and I don't hear anybody saying that Portuguese sounds like English, so there must be more to it than that.

Speaker 1:          04:22          Sibilance. One feature of Russian is that sibilant sounds are quite prominent. Sibilance are continents that have a hissing or hushing sound as in the English sibilants, SA, chef Joe, Joe, Joe. Russian features these sibilants, sa, Zap, chop shop, and Portuguese features. These four sa Za Shock Jock Portuguese contains frequent sibilance and specifically has an abundance of Palo Alto Alveolar sibilants show, which is voiceless and Asia, which has voiced orthographic, s and z are rendered as shook and joe in some contexts before a voiceless consonant or before a pause. Sibilance are pronounced shift. For example, see Dutch meaning cities, las meaning happy in the plural form fresh, Trish. This means makes three. It'll. This means they, in this example, the s becomes at the end of the word and also notice that the reduced vowel, a fully dropped vowel actually results in a consonant cluster ending in ship before I voiced consonant Asia, for example, meaning fortunately it's also worth noting that the letter j and also ge when it's pronounced as a soft g, are also pronounced measure.

Speaker 1:          05:48          These two Russian sibilance and she have similar sounds to Portuguese shot and this Russian sibilant draw is similar to Portuguese, just they're not exactly the same. The Portuguese ones are post Alveolar sibilants while these Russian, once our retroflex sibilance with a slightly different place of articulation, and this one here is an lv Leo Palatal sibilant. This sound is also slightly different from the Portuguese one, but it sounds somewhat similar, at least two people who don't use that sound natively a moment to go. We saw a type of consonant assimilation in Portuguese that makes the sibilant either voiced or voiceless depending on what follows in Russian. There's a similar type of assimilation for most consonants voiced. Consonants are pronounced as voiceless at the end of a word or before another voiceless consonant and voiceless consonants are pronounced as voiced before a voiced consonants, for example, in this word, becomes voiceless and is pronounced as look in this word becomes voiceless, and as pronounced as to zone in this word becomes voiced and as pronounced as good, so the frequent voiceless sibilant ship at the end of words in Portuguese, as well as the assimilation of sibilance to the following consonant, making them either voiceless or voiced measure might unconsciously remind us of the similar but more generalized pattern in Russian.

Speaker 1:          07:19          That same pattern is also a feature of Polish and most other Slavic languages. With Ukrainian being a notable exception, palatalized consonants. One prominent feature of Russian is a distinction between hard consonants and soft consonants, which our palatalized they sound somewhat like the consonant with a yoke sound immediately following Portuguese features too. Palatal consonants. The characters in h represent a palatal nasal, for example, which we saw before. A similar sound appears in Russian as one of the soft consonants, for example, who stand yet meaning eliminate and in Portuguese the letters l, h stand for a palatal lateral approximate, for example, could our volume again, there's a soft consonant in Russian that sounds similar. For example, these two palatal consonants alone are not enough to make Portuguese sounds Slavic. After all the sounds do appearance, some other romance languages too, but together with the other elements, this is one thing that contributes to the overall slavic sound of Portuguese.

Speaker 1:          08:28          The dark l, another phonetic feature that sounds Slavic is the villa rised, l of European Portuguese. This is like the dark l sound at the end of the word field. Oh, the standard elo sound in Russian is also a dark l like this. Here's a Portuguese example. I'll meaning high in a tall meaning Christmas and the Russian example, balut meaning to swim, Luke meaning bowl or onion, nasal vowels and diphthongs. I mentioned before that some people think that Portuguese sounds like Polish Slavic language and all of the features that I mentioned about Russian also applies to polish, but Polish has one other feature in common with Portuguese that Russian does not. Nasal vowels in old slavonic, there were nasal vowels, but in modern Slavic languages, they have merged with oral vowels except for in Polish. In Portuguese there are a number of nasal vowels and nasal diphthongs, and in Polish there are two nasal vowels. This letter is pronounced own, which sounds close to the Portuguese nasal diphthong own, and there's one more. Oh, this is the nasal e sound, because Polish nasal vowels consist of an oral vowel followed by a nasal semi vowel. They sound somewhat like nasal diphthongs, of which Portuguese has several. Here's a Polish example, meaning snake, and here's a Portuguese example with a similar nasal vowel. Here's another Polish example, meaning snakes, and here's a Portuguese example.

Speaker 1:          10:01          So even though a Portuguese is not closely related to Russian Polish or any other Slavic language, they just belong to language families within the wider Indo European language family. That's their only connection. They do share a number of phonological features that make them sound superficially similar to the untrained ear, especially from a distance or when you're not paying attention to what's being said. It's not really a big deal in the grand scheme of things, but it raises an interesting question. What are those features that stand out to us and make us think that they sound similar largely on an unconscious level? The question of the day to speakers of Portuguese and two speakers of Russian Polish and other Slavic languages. Have you ever had the impression that Portuguese sounds Slavic? What sounds are features might have given you that impression and to other people? Does Portuguese sound Russian to you or sounds Slavic to you? You may not consciously know what Russian or slavic sounds like, but you probably associate them with certain sounds unconsciously. Leave your responses in the comments down below.
