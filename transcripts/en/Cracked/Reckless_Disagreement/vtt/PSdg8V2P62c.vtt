1
00:00:01.570 --> 00:00:02.403
Yeah.

2
00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:16.310
Hmm hmm.
Sorry.
I was just drinking a jar of my own.

3
00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:19.400
Nevermind.
Welcome to reckless.
This agreement.

4
00:00:19.401 --> 00:00:22.760
The only show on the Internet you can trust.
I'm your host,
a timid megalomaniac.

5
00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:24.410
And the last time you watched star wars,

6
00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:27.800
did you find yourself wondering where the rebel's got the plans are that star?

7
00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:28.910
If so,
here's your answer.

8
00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.440
Or if you prefer an over complicated version.

9
00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:36.220
<v 1>All right,</v>

10
00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.350
<v 0>look,
I've never made a prequal.
In fact,</v>

11
00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:42.160
I've never made a movie at all and probably shouldn't be so smug when I'm making

12
00:00:42.161 --> 00:00:44.860
fun of them.
But I've got some opinions about rogue one.

13
00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:48.610
The main stream media would have you believe that it's just a good movie about

14
00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:49.810
some star wars.

15
00:00:49.811 --> 00:00:53.710
But I found a copy under some boxes while I was digging around for food last

16
00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:56.920
week and I watched it.
And folks,
it is so much more than that.

17
00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:59.770
Rogue one is an attack on everything you hold dear,

18
00:00:59.771 --> 00:01:03.130
because it makes all the things that happened in star wars.
Ridiculous.

19
00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:04.480
The good guys become bad,

20
00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:07.540
the bad guys become stupid and the plot becomes pointless.

21
00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:09.640
Everything just topsy turvy to hell and back.

22
00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:13.000
So let me finish this and we'll get right to it.

23
00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:15.143
<v 1>Hmm.</v>

24
00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.700
<v 0>Yeah.
It's definitely better if I let it cool down.</v>

25
00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:21.450
Princess Leia is an action hero who accidentally found herself in a damsel in

26
00:01:21.451 --> 00:01:25.830
distress situation and was immediately like somebody has to say my skins,

27
00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.550
and she compared Darth Vader to a naughty puppy talk.

28
00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.870
I should have expected to find you holding Vader's leash or an abused child.

29
00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.090
And most impressively and her very first scene,

30
00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.610
she keeps her wits about her in a stressful situation,

31
00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.060
improvising a clever line to keep the death star plans safe from Vader's

32
00:01:42.061 --> 00:01:43.470
aggressive.
Just stipulations.

33
00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:48.150
I'm a member of the imperial Senate on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan pod or

34
00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:51.720
the rebel line and to trade at least that seems clever.

35
00:01:51.721 --> 00:01:54.330
In 1977 when rogue one came out,

36
00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.140
it revealed that lay was trying to get away with her imperial Senate line five

37
00:01:58.141 --> 00:02:00.750
minutes after a gritty and action packed laser light show.

38
00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.470
She was just on the front lines of the very first battle of a star war and now

39
00:02:04.471 --> 00:02:07.740
she's all,
well,
that wasn't me.
Vader,
sorry.
Get the plans.

40
00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:11.550
What we thought was a bad ass to finance becomes with this context as pathetic

41
00:02:11.551 --> 00:02:12.780
and unconvincing as a panic.

42
00:02:12.781 --> 00:02:16.560
15 year old insisting that the pack of American spirits in her jacket is totally

43
00:02:16.561 --> 00:02:19.620
Jessica's.
Or like someone saying to the cops,
seriously,
I suffer.
Right.

44
00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:23.910
Has it been in Jinxing as her overturn Camaro explodes behind her also,

45
00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:27.000
this is different thing.
They don't know that she has the plans and as a trader.

46
00:02:27.001 --> 00:02:30.090
So why did she is blop her shit?
Why did Bader just blow up or shit,

47
00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:32.970
why didn't Vader,
you know what,
nevermind.

48
00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:41.440
Rogue one is not kind to delay his legacy and I'm talking about more than just

49
00:02:41.441 --> 00:02:43.090
that creepy CGI face.

50
00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:48.820
I'm talking about this and analysis of the plans provided by Princess Leia.
Oh,

51
00:02:48.821 --> 00:02:50.980
they were obtained the by Princess Layo.
Were they?

52
00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:53.860
What was her contribution again?
The transmission we received.

53
00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:58.090
Oh,
so like a five minute walk.
Cool.

54
00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:01.330
I understand she's important and I'm not trying to cut down Leah,

55
00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:04.990
but how come nobody ever mentions the spy who built the fatal flaw into that

56
00:03:04.991 --> 00:03:05.920
store in the first place

57
00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:09.500
<v 1>have placed a weakness deep and within the system of flow,</v>

58
00:03:09.501 --> 00:03:11.690
so small and powerful and then we'll never find it.

59
00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:15.730
<v 0>Or that spies daughter Jen who sacrificed her life to steal those plants or her</v>

60
00:03:15.731 --> 00:03:17.260
buddy Cassie and who's been casually,

61
00:03:17.261 --> 00:03:21.010
often civilians and the name of the rebellions since childhood apparently have

62
00:03:21.011 --> 00:03:23.470
been in this fight since I was six years old.

63
00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:25.210
I think maybe they deserve some credit.
Oh,

64
00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:28.660
and then there was that blind guy with a stick and this guy,

65
00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:31.330
he was like brave.

66
00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:34.690
Then there's all the people who died in the giant battle lay is the most famous

67
00:03:34.691 --> 00:03:36.880
and least important member of a huge team,

68
00:03:36.881 --> 00:03:39.670
but she gets all the credit like the rebellion Stan Lee and wait,

69
00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:43.060
if the rebellion has been going on since Caspian was six how come they've only

70
00:03:43.061 --> 00:03:47.200
now managed to gather their forces?
We've only now managed to gather our forces.

71
00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:50.230
It seems like the rebellion kind of blows were on at the bit.

72
00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:52.390
First let's talk about

73
00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:57.471
grand loft.

74
00:03:57.471 --> 00:04:01.190
Talking like less spends most of his star war casually throwing shade at an

75
00:04:01.191 --> 00:04:05.070
eight foot tall robot space wizard.
What I'm taking an all for risk data,

76
00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:07.760
better work.
What a boss,
right?

77
00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:12.080
It turns out he's just some guy taking credit from director Krennic who actually

78
00:04:12.081 --> 00:04:13.610
designed and built the death star.

79
00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:17.290
<v 1>I will tell him that I will be taking control over the weapon I first spoke of</v>

80
00:04:17.291 --> 00:04:19.060
years ago.
Effective immediately

81
00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:22.590
<v 0>we stand.
Yeah,
I'm mixed.
Meyer,</v>

82
00:04:22.591 --> 00:04:26.520
chief chronics sort of a whiner but it's also hard to be intimidated by target

83
00:04:26.521 --> 00:04:30.200
and now that I know he's just one of the bobs from office space that shouting

84
00:04:30.201 --> 00:04:33.840
nerd was overseeing the project from the beginning and even personally recruited

85
00:04:33.841 --> 00:04:36.320
the people who made the weapon possible.
No,
I don't.

86
00:04:36.321 --> 00:04:39.630
Space Office politics is like not the most interesting thing to be talking about

87
00:04:39.631 --> 00:04:40.081
in this video,

88
00:04:40.081 --> 00:04:43.710
but this is the second time ro one has gone out of its way to let us know that a

89
00:04:43.711 --> 00:04:46.470
character we once thought was cool isn't actually cool.

90
00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:49.590
The empire is run by a bunch of screening suits and not the scary kind of

91
00:04:49.591 --> 00:04:52.650
scheming,
the annoying kind of scheming that makes you one popular.

92
00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:54.030
This last shot is very different.

93
00:04:54.031 --> 00:04:59.031
If the empire is just Dilbert Catbert,

94
00:04:59.221 --> 00:05:02.220
we're just incinerated and had the remains hurled at the bic void of space.

95
00:05:02.221 --> 00:05:03.600
I don't know.
It bugs me.

96
00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:09.350
Remember Admiral Marty,

97
00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:13.070
he's the guy who was talking up the death star in this scene saying this station

98
00:05:13.071 --> 00:05:15.500
is now the ultimate power in the universe.

99
00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:19.930
I suggest we use it and invaders like Dorothy too proud on

100
00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:25.010
the [inaudible].
This is just Bain.

101
00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:28.710
I'm just doing vein is insignificant tax to the power before,

102
00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:32.030
which is a bit like interrupting a shareholders' meeting to say marketing did a

103
00:05:32.031 --> 00:05:35.240
great job,
but the real hero here was Jesus.
But anyway,

104
00:05:35.241 --> 00:05:39.140
modest reply is don't try to frighten us with your sorcerers ways.
Lord Vader,

105
00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:42.980
your sad devotion to that ancient religion has not hoped you conjure up the

106
00:05:42.981 --> 00:05:46.920
store in data tapes.
Oh,
given you clairvoyants enough to find the rebels.

107
00:05:46.921 --> 00:05:47.754
Hidden fault.

108
00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:50.003
<v 1>Okay,</v>

109
00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:54.920
<v 0>I'm sorry.
And went down the wrong hole.</v>

110
00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:59.660
A bad moment for a sip in retrospect point is joking people is Vader's signature

111
00:05:59.661 --> 00:06:00.650
management technique.

112
00:06:00.651 --> 00:06:03.650
Mati seems like kind of a dummy before rogue one even came out,

113
00:06:03.651 --> 00:06:06.500
but now we also know that not only with this going on

114
00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:11.953
so was this.

115
00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:18.630
There's also no way he thinks his devotion to the forces sad when it gives you

116
00:06:18.631 --> 00:06:21.840
the ability to waste a hallway full of dudes and 28 seconds flat.
Yeah,

117
00:06:21.841 --> 00:06:22.674
I timed it.
What?

118
00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:25.500
It's possible that this is [inaudible] first day and he decided to make an

119
00:06:25.501 --> 00:06:28.680
impression as a tough guy by insulting the only guy in the room was allowed to

120
00:06:28.681 --> 00:06:31.320
wear a cape to the meeting.
But that just seems like a bad idea.

121
00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:33.690
We have not yet met a competent member of the empire,

122
00:06:33.691 --> 00:06:36.150
so how come the rebellion doesn't just steamroll them?
Well,

123
00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:39.810
I'm glad you asked that Straw man voice in my head because polio,
shucks.

124
00:06:39.811 --> 00:06:41.160
If I got an answer for you

125
00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:46.870
now that we're near the end of my video,

126
00:06:46.871 --> 00:06:49.300
let me finally actually explain the plot of rogue one first.

127
00:06:49.301 --> 00:06:51.970
The rebellion recruits Jen Rza who investigate the death star.

128
00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.160
He's claiming the emperor is creating a weapon,

129
00:06:54.930 --> 00:06:58.270
the power to destroy the entire planet,
but when she brings back a report,

130
00:06:58.271 --> 00:07:02.410
they're split between not believing her daughters who's known reason.

131
00:07:02.411 --> 00:07:03.520
When my father have to lie,

132
00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:07.270
what benefit would it bring him to lear our forces into a final battle to

133
00:07:07.271 --> 00:07:08.740
destroy us once and for all?

134
00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:13.750
Everything based on what the testimony of the criminal and thinking,

135
00:07:13.751 --> 00:07:16.960
they should just surrender.
If the empire has this kind of power,

136
00:07:16.961 --> 00:07:21.700
what chance do we have?
What chance do we have?
There is no hope

137
00:07:23.530 --> 00:07:25.170
is finished.
In the end,

138
00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:27.910
they compromise and say that they don't believe her and they're going to

139
00:07:27.911 --> 00:07:31.810
surrender.
I'm sorry,
without the full support of the council,

140
00:07:32.030 --> 00:07:35.650
the author to grade,
they prefer to surrender or why center in the first place.

141
00:07:35.650 --> 00:07:38.800
If you're not going to believe her,
you might ask or maybe that's stupid,

142
00:07:38.801 --> 00:07:40.420
but I'm not done.
After that meeting,

143
00:07:40.421 --> 00:07:43.930
gin and her buddies defy the rebellion and go to steal the death star plans.

144
00:07:43.931 --> 00:07:44.410
Anyway.

145
00:07:44.410 --> 00:07:47.780
Then the rebellion finds out and launches an attack which makes the empire put

146
00:07:47.781 --> 00:07:51.100
up their shields,
trapping our heroes on the planet.
To explode and die.

147
00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:52.000
So to recap,

148
00:07:52.001 --> 00:07:55.400
gene or so and her buddies singlehandedly saved the rebellion and exchange that

149
00:07:55.410 --> 00:07:57.700
got screwed over by bureaucracy and written out of history.

150
00:07:57.701 --> 00:08:00.970
So all the credit for their accomplishments was given to a smuggler,
a farm boy,

151
00:08:00.971 --> 00:08:03.910
a princess,
and a monkey,
which is a pretty good name for a folk song.

152
00:08:03.970 --> 00:08:05.780
And now we've reached what this means.
Okay.

153
00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:14.270
Disney and Gareth Edwards or trying to ruin star wars.
Why?
I don't know,

154
00:08:14.271 --> 00:08:16.720
to make room for more marvel movies to turn us all into Communist.

155
00:08:16.721 --> 00:08:17.540
Probably that one,

156
00:08:17.540 --> 00:08:20.270
whatever the case we have to do whatever it takes to stop them.

157
00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:25.220
And by we I'm mean you because like this is sort of embarrassing but the door to

158
00:08:25.221 --> 00:08:27.200
this bunker on the open from the outside and I'm not getting it.

159
00:08:27.201 --> 00:08:29.660
Cell reception down here and I'm quickly running out of food and how long ago

160
00:08:29.661 --> 00:08:30.471
ran out of fresh water.

161
00:08:30.471 --> 00:08:35.250
So if anybody wants to call the head of cracked or even just come by and
no,

162
00:08:35.290 --> 00:08:38.790
never mind,
don't worry about it.
I got,
I got this covered.
I'll be fine.

163
00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:42.810
I'll be fine.
No worries.
Thanks for watching.

164
00:08:44.050 --> 00:08:45.910
That's a farm boy.

165
00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:49.940
I blew a monkey around and adventure

166
00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:57.030
was that old fashioned blaster,
the Millennium Falcon and the boy's dad.

167
00:08:57.040 --> 00:09:00.730
His Saber line.
Thanks for watching reckless disagreement.

168
00:09:00.750 --> 00:09:03.150
