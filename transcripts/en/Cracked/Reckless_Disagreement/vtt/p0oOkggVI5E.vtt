1
00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:14.930
Come direct with disagreement.
The only show on the Internet you can trust.

2
00:00:14.931 --> 00:00:16.370
I'm your host,
a sexy genius,

3
00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:19.880
and I've spent the day memorizing poetry because of this scenes from goodwill

4
00:00:19.881 --> 00:00:20.200
hunting.

5
00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:21.070
<v 2>It's a matter of fact,</v>

6
00:00:21.071 --> 00:00:25.500
I won't because would drastically underestimates the impact social do it

7
00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:29.110
drastically underestimates the impact of social distinctions predicated upon

8
00:00:29.111 --> 00:00:30.650
wealth,
especially inherited wealth.
Yeah,

9
00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:35.020
you got that from Vegas Work in Essex County,
page 98 right,

10
00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:37.240
<v 0>because Matt Damon is a brilliant mathematician.</v>

11
00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:40.960
He is apparently memorized entire history textbooks right down to the page

12
00:00:40.961 --> 00:00:43.570
number of certain important quotes.
Hence,
yeah,

13
00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:47.090
I figure if memorizing history textbooks makes you a good mathematician,

14
00:00:47.091 --> 00:00:50.180
memorizing romantic poetry will probably help me figure out how to escape from

15
00:00:50.181 --> 00:00:53.150
this youtube bunker.
I've locked myself in.
That logic follows,
right?

16
00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:55.040
I'm getting a little desperate,

17
00:00:55.041 --> 00:00:58.040
so let's just get right to discussing all the weird assumptions Hollywood makes

18
00:00:58.041 --> 00:00:58.874
about smart people.

19
00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:07.590
<v 2>It is a melancholy truth that even great men have poor relations.</v>

20
00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.690
Dickens.
Oh No.
I know how much he might say with irony.

21
00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.680
I say with conviction,
what a piece of work is,
ma'am.

22
00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.470
<v 0>I get what they're going for here.
If your brain has all this extra space,</v>

23
00:01:19.471 --> 00:01:21.600
you may as well fill it with expensive sounding words,
right?

24
00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.120
But the ability to repeat things other people wrote down,

25
00:01:24.121 --> 00:01:25.980
it doesn't necessarily mean you're smart.

26
00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:29.160
Think of all your friends who can recite bill Pullman speech from Independence

27
00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:31.650
Day.
We will not go quietly into the night,

28
00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:34.560
which is actually pretty close to what's happening in this famous scene from

29
00:01:34.561 --> 00:01:39.240
tune stone.
First Doc holiday's like Vino Veritas.
Then real quick ring goes all,

30
00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.640
ah gee quote Agis and then holiday gives him a look,

31
00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:46.890
takes his time and says credit Jew dies.
Pella non ego.

32
00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:48.330
Gonna ego takes a second.

33
00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:53.360
Then you've [inaudible] magister and then holidays all in pouches.

34
00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:57.970
Scott,
that's not a conversation.

35
00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:01.870
[inaudible] goes is semi antisemetic line from one of horses.

36
00:02:01.871 --> 00:02:04.120
Satires that means let the Jew a Pella,

37
00:02:04.121 --> 00:02:08.340
believe it not I holiday says you have a dental.
Mr Ringu was an educator.
Yeah,

38
00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:11.270
no,
I really hate them,

39
00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:14.210
but really they're just throwing semi relevant famous quotes at each other like

40
00:02:14.211 --> 00:02:18.140
a couple of 19th century Jake Peralta's welcome to the party pal.

41
00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:21.740
Decides what kind of loser would spend all his time memorizing lines from his

42
00:02:21.741 --> 00:02:25.480
favorite.
Well,
this is a little bit different,
but you know,

43
00:02:25.481 --> 00:02:28.510
whenever a genius movie character quickly solves a Rubik's cube,

44
00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:34.060
busy cake solving the cube isn't an insane feet.
Anyone can do it.

45
00:02:34.061 --> 00:02:37.450
Provided they read the instruction manual that comes with every Rubik's cube.

46
00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:41.030
It's a party trick like knowing Origami,
you're quoting Dr Strange love.

47
00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:45.490
Oh,
and I decided after very little research,

48
00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:49.000
this phenomenon can be traced back to Jay Robert Oppenheimer who reacted to the

49
00:02:49.001 --> 00:02:52.150
first ever successful nuclear bomb tests by remembering a quote from Hindi

50
00:02:52.151 --> 00:02:52.450
script.

51
00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:54.630
<v 1>Sure,
no,
I am the world,</v>

52
00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:57.890
<v 0>but didn't actually say it.</v>

53
00:02:57.891 --> 00:03:00.640
He just remembered it because if he hadn't really responded to the first ever

54
00:03:00.641 --> 00:03:05.080
nuclear explosion with I am becoming death destroyer of worlds,

55
00:03:05.081 --> 00:03:10.081
everyone would have been like sort of Julius the j theJ and j Robert Oppenheimer

56
00:03:11.591 --> 00:03:14.110
stands for Julius.
Was that clear without me explaining it?

57
00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:17.320
Here's an incomplete list of smart characters that are also huge dicks.

58
00:03:17.321 --> 00:03:20.680
You got your Dr. House,
you're Tony Stark,
you're John Nash from a Beautiful Mind.

59
00:03:20.681 --> 00:03:24.490
Mark Zuckerberg from social network and re Higgins from my fair lady Nathan from

60
00:03:24.491 --> 00:03:29.491
x Makena Caleb from x Mokena ava from x Mokena eventually Sherlock Holmes,

61
00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:31.950
Sherlock Holmes,
Sherlock Holmes,
Alan Turing,
Julian Assange,
Dr Stephen.

62
00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:36.700
Strange con.
Wait,
how many benedict Cumberbatch is that we had here who?

63
00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:39.700
Bacha Cumberbatch.
No,
that was terrible.

64
00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:42.580
I should have learned how to edit so I can cut that out.
In real life.

65
00:03:42.581 --> 00:03:46.690
You can be a genius and cool to people.
It's true.
I've seen it happen.
In fact,

66
00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:49.600
the tendency is toward the opposite of this.
The smarter you are,

67
00:03:49.601 --> 00:03:53.170
the more aware you are of your own shortcomings and the knowledge that you don't

68
00:03:53.171 --> 00:03:54.130
have.
It's dumb.

69
00:03:54.131 --> 00:03:56.860
People who tend to be cocky and overestimating their own intelligence.

70
00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:58.810
This is called the dunning Kruger effect.

71
00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:02.320
The people who think they're wicked smart or actually we can dump,
for example,

72
00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:04.600
see men explaining jokes to women on Twitter.

73
00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:07.900
Most of Reddit or the people correcting my abridged definition of the dunning

74
00:04:07.901 --> 00:04:11.590
Kruger effect in the comments below.
Now I know about you.

75
00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:14.830
I understand that there really have been smart people in the world who were also

76
00:04:14.831 --> 00:04:15.311
Dick's,

77
00:04:15.311 --> 00:04:19.060
but the infatuation with them that movies seem to have is still pretty baffling.

78
00:04:19.061 --> 00:04:19.301
To me.

79
00:04:19.301 --> 00:04:22.510
It's like we think the best part of being smart would be not having to tolerate

80
00:04:22.511 --> 00:04:25.090
other people anymore,
which like life hack.

81
00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:28.750
You don't have to be smart to be addicted people you can be dumb and mean.

82
00:04:28.751 --> 00:04:30.880
That's just some information for you to chew on.

83
00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:34.630
Batch of Cumberbatch,
you're better than this.

84
00:04:34.631 --> 00:04:37.990
Surgeon movies really like to show us smart people writing on glass.

85
00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:39.850
I don't have much to say about this other than it's weird.

86
00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.240
Our smart people too distracted by their own genius to keep a note pad around.

87
00:04:43.241 --> 00:04:44.560
Scraps of paper are everywhere.

88
00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:47.830
I have one here and I'm going to be trapped in an underground bunker with a

89
00:04:47.831 --> 00:04:49.600
bunch of DVDs and some camera equipment.

90
00:04:49.601 --> 00:04:53.190
I'm living off of Stu and re fried beans and even I know where the damn notepad

91
00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:57.610
is.
That's all.
Oh Gee,

92
00:04:57.611 --> 00:04:59.680
I just thought of something clever.
I should write it down.

93
00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:04.820
<v 2>When did you become an expert in thermo nuclear astrophysics last night?</v>

94
00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:07.120
<v 0>Well,
Tony Stark needs to build something.</v>

95
00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:10.720
We always see it happen because Robert Downey Jr looks great with his shirt off,

96
00:05:10.721 --> 00:05:15.010
especially for a 52 year old man.
Wow.
That they do good,
Bob.
Oh,

97
00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:17.170
Bob and I are friends,
which is why I get to call him Baba,

98
00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:19.330
but there's nothing sexy about working your brain muscles.

99
00:05:19.331 --> 00:05:22.570
So movies just skip that part and make brilliant ideas seem like they pop up

100
00:05:22.571 --> 00:05:24.180
with no warning like Boehner sometimes.

101
00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:31.910
<v 2>Well,
each of his messages begins with the same five letters.
C I.
L.
L.
Y.</v>

102
00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:34.460
So I suspect that city must be the name of fizzy.

103
00:05:34.461 --> 00:05:38.630
More possible the gyms are instructed to use five randomness is at the start of

104
00:05:38.631 --> 00:05:41.690
every message.
Well,
this blood doesn't love,

105
00:05:41.691 --> 00:05:44.830
will make a band do strange things as part of this case.

106
00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:50.790
I've just lost Germany.
The whole bloody walked.
What does that,

107
00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:56.030
what's a matter of a deal?
We will go for the blind,

108
00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:58.220
the block each other.

109
00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:01.720
<v 3>Not a single one of us just going to get her.</v>

110
00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:04.930
<v 0>We love this idea so much that we write it into true stories.</v>

111
00:06:04.931 --> 00:06:08.210
Alan Turing didn't crack the German codes because if it's something a girl said

112
00:06:08.211 --> 00:06:08.830
in a bar,

113
00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:11.620
it would have been illegal for her to discuss her decoded transmissions with him

114
00:06:11.621 --> 00:06:11.981
at all,

115
00:06:11.981 --> 00:06:15.070
and John Nash didn't invent the Nash equilibrium because of a pretty blonde,

116
00:06:15.071 --> 00:06:18.520
because that's not even how the Nash equilibrium works.
Wait a minute.

117
00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:23.140
Matthew Goode was an imitation game and he was also in watchman where he played

118
00:06:23.141 --> 00:06:24.190
Ozzy man dayas.

119
00:06:24.191 --> 00:06:28.090
You sometimes quoted Percy Shelley who wrote epit sub Kinney and which sounds

120
00:06:28.091 --> 00:06:30.790
like epiphany.
Epiphany is do what happen in real life,

121
00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:34.360
but this is still part of Hollywood's weird aversion to showing us characters

122
00:06:34.361 --> 00:06:37.330
who actually work for a living.
But Tony Stark ever.
Then the board meeting,

123
00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:39.310
that man sleeps through his Indiana Jones,

124
00:06:39.311 --> 00:06:42.550
sneaks out of his office window to avoid grading even a single paper and those

125
00:06:42.551 --> 00:06:43.630
people that are all geniuses.

126
00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:47.770
I'm not saying we have to have a 45 minute scene where Indiana Jones gets in

127
00:06:47.771 --> 00:06:51.430
trouble with tenure review,
but it's kind of weird how much we idolize laziness,

128
00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:54.310
American culture as his major heart on for pulling yourself up by your

129
00:06:54.311 --> 00:06:55.810
bootstraps and paying your dues,

130
00:06:55.811 --> 00:06:58.570
but all are really brilliant aspirational heroes.
Never do any of that.

131
00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:08.720
<v 3>These smart arms that are controlled by my brain through a neural lik nano wires</v>

132
00:07:09.751 --> 00:07:14.751
feed directly into my cerebellum allowing me to use these arms to control fusion

133
00:07:15.481 --> 00:07:18.630
reaction in an environment no human hand could enter.

134
00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:20.120
<v 0>Quick question,
Doctor Octopus,</v>

135
00:07:20.121 --> 00:07:23.240
are you a physicist or on the neurologist or a roboticist because you just

136
00:07:23.241 --> 00:07:26.780
casually described incredible breakthroughs in all of those fields and you know

137
00:07:26.781 --> 00:07:29.090
what?
It's not fair for me to use the super villain,

138
00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:32.090
but stick to normies like Lucius Fox from Batman who not only knows how to

139
00:07:32.091 --> 00:07:33.500
design and build the train system,

140
00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:37.340
but also how to run a multinational Super Corporation and cure fear toxin,

141
00:07:37.341 --> 00:07:41.300
but fine.
Again,
I get it.
We're still in superhero movies.

142
00:07:41.301 --> 00:07:42.820
Dr Elizabeth Straw from Prometheus's,

143
00:07:42.830 --> 00:07:45.920
an archeologist and astronauts and feels comfortable performing an autopsy on an

144
00:07:45.921 --> 00:07:46.430
alien head.

145
00:07:46.430 --> 00:07:50.000
Those are three very specific skills that require a lifetime of study and the

146
00:07:50.001 --> 00:07:52.400
third one isn't even a thing and bringing back will hunting.

147
00:07:52.401 --> 00:07:53.870
He's not just a great mathematician.

148
00:07:53.871 --> 00:07:57.020
He memorizes textbooks already said that it is a total expert in the probably

149
00:07:57.021 --> 00:07:59.720
made up feel the reading people's minds based on their paintings.

150
00:07:59.780 --> 00:08:01.040
Maybe you married the wrong woman,

151
00:08:01.220 --> 00:08:03.920
maybe you should watch your mouth and this is a problem that has bled over into

152
00:08:03.921 --> 00:08:07.760
the real world.
Bill Nye,
the science guy isn't an expert in all of science,

153
00:08:07.940 --> 00:08:10.940
but we treat them like an expert in climate change because he has science in his

154
00:08:10.941 --> 00:08:13.190
middle name.
I mean I agree with them,

155
00:08:13.191 --> 00:08:16.070
but we may as well be getting a take from Dennis Quaid and see at least played a

156
00:08:16.071 --> 00:08:17.450
climate change expert in a movie,

157
00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:21.440
which is why real climate experts have issues with what he says.
Also,
you know,

158
00:08:21.470 --> 00:08:24.680
Stephen Hawking occasionally predicts of the end of the world.
That's fine,

159
00:08:24.681 --> 00:08:28.280
but it has nothing to do a theoretical physics,
which is his area of expertise.

160
00:08:28.310 --> 00:08:31.580
Science is actually like a whole bunch of different things.
It's really,
well,

161
00:08:31.581 --> 00:08:33.890
it was treated by this cartoon by Professor Matt and Mike,

162
00:08:33.891 --> 00:08:37.730
which shows a circle containing all of human knowledge and she was a phd as a

163
00:08:37.731 --> 00:08:40.700
tiny little red dick poking out toward the rent,
which by the way,

164
00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:44.210
vindicates the entire point of my show because we've conclusively proven the

165
00:08:44.211 --> 00:08:46.100
movies are screwing with our heads and making us dumber.

166
00:08:46.100 --> 00:08:48.980
So this isn't just a bunch of pointless observations.
These are real problems.

167
00:08:49.010 --> 00:08:52.970
I'm doing important work here.
We all are together.
Let's finish up.

168
00:08:54.440 --> 00:08:57.610
There's the,
there's a title.
Have you read it?
Is it long enough?
Great.
Cool.

169
00:08:59.100 --> 00:09:01.770
I'm not really worried about smart people.
They're going to be fine.
If anything,

170
00:09:02.340 --> 00:09:04.170
they're probably in on it.
Trying to fool us,

171
00:09:04.171 --> 00:09:07.740
make it harder for us to know what's really going on so they can stay.

172
00:09:07.741 --> 00:09:12.570
One step ahead.
I God,
what are the smart people hiding?

173
00:09:13.470 --> 00:09:16.290
Oh,
well it's probably boring.
I mean,
they're just a bunch of nerds.
Anyway.

174
00:09:18.970 --> 00:09:19.803
Dammit.

175
00:09:23.510 --> 00:09:24.590
Thanks for watching.
Our video,

176
00:09:24.591 --> 00:09:26.630
hit the sea in the middle to subscribe at the belt,

177
00:09:26.631 --> 00:09:28.610
the bottom be notified and we put up a new video.

178
00:09:28.611 --> 00:09:32.600
And for those of you who stuck around and then a traveler from an anti planned

179
00:09:32.601 --> 00:09:34.280
who said too vast and trunk,

180
00:09:34.281 --> 00:09:37.970
less legs of stone stand in the desert near them on the sand.
