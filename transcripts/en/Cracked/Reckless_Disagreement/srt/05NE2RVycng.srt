1
00:00:01,570 --> 00:00:02,403
Yeah.

2
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:13,260
Welcome to reckless disagreement.

3
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:16,380
The only show on the Internet
that you can trust. I'm your host,

4
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:19,600
a paranoid recluse. And here's a
clip from Raiders of the lost Ark.

5
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:24,893
Yeah.

6
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:28,710
Now,
when I saw that scene as a kid,

7
00:00:28,711 --> 00:00:31,980
I just assumed that that's how grown ups
got drunk after they made me go to bed.

8
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:33,900
But when I grew up and
started drinking on my own,

9
00:00:33,901 --> 00:00:38,040
I realized that if you tried to play a
drinking game like that, you would die.

10
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:38,701
I'm meticulous.

11
00:00:38,701 --> 00:00:41,910
Research tells me that it takes 30
minutes to feel the effects of alcohol.

12
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:45,120
So if you're taking shots up until the
second that you collapse on the floor,

13
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:46,890
you're going to keep getting more drunk.

14
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:50,040
So this sweaty fat man isn't just
passing out, is falling into a coma.

15
00:00:50,041 --> 00:00:51,800
Marian Ravenwood just killed that

16
00:00:51,910 --> 00:00:52,743
guy

17
00:00:55,540 --> 00:00:56,440
and then she killed that guy.

18
00:00:56,620 --> 00:01:01,620
This made me realize no one who makes
movies has ever been drunk somehow.

19
00:01:01,961 --> 00:01:06,850
So I decided that I would get drunk
and explained to them all the mistakes

20
00:01:06,851 --> 00:01:11,470
they're making. All right, let's see. Uh,

21
00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:19,060
that's not right. They're supposed to be,
oh, there's a title. Aw, it's gorgeous.

22
00:01:19,061 --> 00:01:19,894
And I love it.

23
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:23,500
Raiders isn't the only movie that thinks
this is how drinking games work and the

24
00:01:23,501 --> 00:01:27,670
two towers legless and Gimley engaged in
a drinking game with only three rules.

25
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:34,900
So it's a drinking.
No,

26
00:01:34,901 --> 00:01:39,550
that's just drinking game implies
like ping pong balls or underwear,

27
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:41,710
right?
This is the only drinking game.

28
00:01:41,711 --> 00:01:44,080
Anyone in movies ever replays
and even happens in four

29
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:51,360
we fought, he made his ancestors
proud. I admit I'm not a viking,

30
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:54,510
but how does drinking so much that
your buddy has to carry you home,

31
00:01:54,511 --> 00:01:55,950
make anybody proud of you?

32
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:59,400
This game only makes sense
if your perspective on
drinking is limited to sing.

33
00:01:59,401 --> 00:02:03,720
People leave for and returned from the
bar and you're just trying to guess what

34
00:02:03,721 --> 00:02:07,170
went on in between to turn your
friends into pukey bags of shame. Well,

35
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:10,860
you guessed wrong movies,
you guessed real wrong,

36
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:12,540
and you should be ashamed

37
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:18,710
in movies,
bars,

38
00:02:18,711 --> 00:02:21,980
the place you go when you're just
itching for an excuse to explode into a

39
00:02:21,981 --> 00:02:23,690
whirlwind of gritty fisticuffs.

40
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:26,180
There's so many examples that I'm
just going to stick to movies.

41
00:02:26,181 --> 00:02:27,200
I love like the guests,

42
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:39,080
dirty work,
Deadpool,

43
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:44,510
and I'd be kind of an idiot if I
didn't at least mention roadhouse.

44
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:50,330
Okay.
Okay.

45
00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:54,110
Now show me another clip from dirty
work. Oh, nice. Stone Street bike, man.

46
00:02:57,350 --> 00:03:00,090
You just hit g eight.

47
00:03:00,210 --> 00:03:01,090
Yeah,
if you like,

48
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:06,360
now I'm getting here. Rock bar fights
happen and they're always hilarious.

49
00:03:06,361 --> 00:03:09,750
But your average dive bar isn't the time
bomb of homophobia waiting to be set

50
00:03:09,751 --> 00:03:13,430
off by a guy with dreamy eyes
ordering a blowjob shot at the blue.

51
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:16,440
Not every bar fight I've ever seen.

52
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:20,100
It was just a couple of drunk dudes
grappling with each other and spelling my

53
00:03:20,101 --> 00:03:21,870
drink and to the bouncer kicked it off.

54
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:25,170
And you know what to all the people
writing comments about how bad ass the bar

55
00:03:25,171 --> 00:03:28,620
fights you've been in are, who are
you trying to impress is in me? Oh,

56
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:33,060
I'm flooding. Keep uh, keep,
uh, yeah, keep doing that.

57
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:34,653
Okay.

58
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:39,940
So we'll just afford to drinks on me.

59
00:03:48,050 --> 00:03:52,340
I am completely sure that nothing like
that has ever happened in all of history.

60
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:57,290
I've worked in a bar and I don't even
know how you'd do that as a bartender.

61
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:00,930
Nothing important. Wait, as the
guy who offered to buy the rounds,

62
00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:03,680
not paying for the beer,
what I might be wrong about this.

63
00:04:03,681 --> 00:04:05,000
I mean when I worked in a bar,

64
00:04:05,001 --> 00:04:09,380
I was 17 and the bartender and used to
give me a six pack. When I did a good job,

65
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:14,420
nothing's going to shut down.
The effects might be related,

66
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:17,150
but they also make me question
this scene from Skyfall,

67
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:27,430
it was just happened. Did bond walk
in there with a Scorpion and say, hey,

68
00:04:27,431 --> 00:04:31,300
everyone watched this or does a bartender
habit waiting there would have anybody

69
00:04:31,301 --> 00:04:35,830
who isn't James Bond order's this cocktail
like say a drunk me and get stung and

70
00:04:35,831 --> 00:04:39,490
dies. Is the reputation for being the bar
with the Scorpions worth the hassle of

71
00:04:39,491 --> 00:04:42,550
disposing of dead bodies and the
effort it takes to feed and maintain a

72
00:04:42,551 --> 00:04:46,930
terrarium of deadly Arachnids?
No, no. It's not. Next entry

73
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:53,820
movies think beer makes you hallucinate.

74
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:01,880
[inaudible]

75
00:05:02,910 --> 00:05:05,160
not to Brag,
but I've been really drunk before.

76
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:08,910
I've gone on journeys of inebriated
self discovery and I feed on cop cars,

77
00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:11,880
but I've never been so drunk that I
hallucinated something that wasn't there

78
00:05:11,881 --> 00:05:14,490
because alcohol's effect
is the opposite of that.

79
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:16,920
I'm pretty sure this joke comes
from the scene and Pinocchio,

80
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:21,030
Pinocchio sees all his friends turning
into donkeys and he slowly pushes away

81
00:05:21,031 --> 00:05:24,510
his glass of beer because he just
figured out that that'll turn him into a

82
00:05:24,511 --> 00:05:25,230
donkey to,

83
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:28,950
but everyone in Hollywood assume that
Pinocchio thought the beer was making him

84
00:05:28,951 --> 00:05:32,490
hallucinate because they've never
been drunk before. So let me be clear,

85
00:05:32,491 --> 00:05:34,800
Hollywood, if you want to
see things that aren't there,

86
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:37,500
you're going to have to do what the
rest of us do and go make friends with

87
00:05:37,501 --> 00:05:40,590
someone with a snake tattoo. But if
movie booze isn't helping you trip out,

88
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:44,340
it's giving you special powers and the
Big Bang theory, which none of you watch.

89
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:47,880
But all of you know about a character
named Raj can only talk to women when he's

90
00:05:47,881 --> 00:05:52,260
drunk. Then he can talk to him. Fine.
Like a normy. Well, the red a simulation,

91
00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:56,850
that's not a wacky joke about shyness.
That's a serious drinking,

92
00:05:57,290 --> 00:06:00,200
kind of like what Tom Cruise has in
the last Samurai until the Samurai.

93
00:06:00,201 --> 00:06:04,250
Just like take his booze away for a couple
of days and he wakes up cure not just

94
00:06:04,251 --> 00:06:07,430
of his addiction but also of pts.
Ah,

95
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:11,150
how peaceful the nature,
the trees,

96
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:14,930
their sobriety.
Japan has cured me.

97
00:06:15,450 --> 00:06:18,350
I am so good at being Japanese.

98
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:22,510
I am the Last Samurai IRS my kidneys.

99
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,193
Okay.

100
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:29,230
All right. Uh, well all
the lights were out there.

101
00:06:29,231 --> 00:06:32,690
Someone just informed me that
lots of people drink and uh,

102
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:37,240
my thesis is ridiculous. Fine. Thanks
Kevin. And I mentioned that earlier,

103
00:06:37,241 --> 00:06:38,710
but uh,

104
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:42,670
even so let's take stock of how
Hollywood drinks first they chuck,

105
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:43,930
then they fight.

106
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:48,460
Then the inconvenience of bartender and
then the Scorpion that might not even be

107
00:06:48,461 --> 00:06:52,210
there before quitting drinking forever
and move into Japan. That's not healthy.

108
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:55,660
That's an unsustainable way to live.
You got to sort this out in movies.

109
00:06:57,700 --> 00:07:00,460
That's what I'm really, well sure. Roles.

110
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:04,150
But in the top of the
way to end it though,

111
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,830
I guess let's try,

112
00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:17,180
Hey, you like stand up, come
see the cracked standup show.

113
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:20,900
It's happening June 22nd at
meltdown comics in Los Angeles.

114
00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:24,890
If you want to see amazing
comics, including our own
Josh sergeant, go to Nerd,

115
00:07:24,891 --> 00:07:29,810
melt la.com/tickets and if you
want to see me do a funny dance.

116
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:32,870
Sorry,
not today.
