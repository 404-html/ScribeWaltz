1
00:00:01,570 --> 00:00:02,403
Yeah.

2
00:00:16,810 --> 00:00:17,800
Who turned this on?

3
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:22,100
Oh, am I talking to no one here,
but me and the shadow people.

4
00:00:23,450 --> 00:00:26,540
Welcome to reckless disagreement. The
only show on the Internet you can trust.

5
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:29,930
I'm your host. I'm slowly starving
to death and myself made prison.

6
00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:33,110
And here's a clip from Buffy the vampire
slayer where she discovers a dark

7
00:00:33,111 --> 00:00:37,580
secret about an evil corporation.
The double meat medley is vegetables.

8
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:40,130
How do you know that she's
immediately offered a bribe?

9
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:43,940
You want money but instead insists
on taking a minimum wage job.

10
00:00:43,970 --> 00:00:47,000
I'd really like to not be fired anymore.
Some context here,

11
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:50,720
but for the vampire slayer is a vampire
slayer and the only person standing

12
00:00:50,721 --> 00:00:54,290
between the citizens of Sunnydale and a
sinister cessation of existence due to

13
00:00:54,291 --> 00:00:57,140
blood sucking every second she
spends flipping burgers is a second.

14
00:00:57,141 --> 00:00:59,450
Some poor schmuck is getting,
his hemoglobin is gobbled.

15
00:00:59,510 --> 00:01:03,890
People died because she was too virtuous
to blackmail and multinational fast

16
00:01:03,891 --> 00:01:05,780
food chain for lying to their customers.

17
00:01:05,810 --> 00:01:09,200
And that is the moment that I realized
that no one in Hollywood understands

18
00:01:09,201 --> 00:01:12,860
poverty or working for a living
or even money far fetched. Right?

19
00:01:13,130 --> 00:01:13,851
Who could believe that?

20
00:01:13,851 --> 00:01:17,210
The notorious Lee down to earth and
relatable billionaires of Hollywood hills

21
00:01:17,211 --> 00:01:20,890
could possibly, you got it. You know
where I'm going? Let's just get to it.

22
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:27,940
Mana is going on.

23
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:32,350
I am new owner of alibi.
Well, we can't stay here.

24
00:01:33,170 --> 00:01:38,150
Not enough money in the kid and keep the
lights on past midnight. What a B, a,

25
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:39,583
B,
and e.

26
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:44,230
Somebody broke into the bar and Stoller
seeing kids after getting laid off.

27
00:01:44,231 --> 00:01:48,250
I was finally pursuing my lifelong dream,
starting my own architecture firm.

28
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:50,020
You know what really grinds my gears?

29
00:01:50,230 --> 00:01:52,900
The fact that there is no point in the
TV characters life or they're terrible

30
00:01:52,901 --> 00:01:53,980
decisions catch up to them.

31
00:01:53,981 --> 00:01:57,490
It's just wacky adventures and gross and
competence and then they go home every

32
00:01:57,490 --> 00:02:00,310
day to an amazing apartment because I
guess they started a gogurt commercial

33
00:02:00,311 --> 00:02:04,150
ones. There's still air in that spot.
Yeah, dude covered my rent for years.

34
00:02:04,151 --> 00:02:08,830
Now gogurt comes through. Let's talk about
the amazing home Ted marshland share.

35
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:10,540
Sharon, how I met your mother
and it's like a thought.

36
00:02:10,541 --> 00:02:12,550
We don't really need to talk about it.
Looking at it,

37
00:02:12,551 --> 00:02:14,650
it's probably sufficient for this point.
You're smart.

38
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:17,080
Your brain can draw
conclusions from simple images.

39
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:19,810
The most interesting example has got
to be the show shameless, which is,

40
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,930
let's be clear, an amazing show, but
take a look at the house they live in.

41
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:24,400
So a lot of people live in the real world.

42
00:02:24,401 --> 00:02:26,710
Probably the most realistic
come I've ever seen on TV,

43
00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:31,030
but listen to what flood magazine has to
say about it. Shameless is raw, honest,

44
00:02:31,031 --> 00:02:31,810
and dark.

45
00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:35,260
The audience can practically smell the
Fed marsh of its settings through the

46
00:02:35,261 --> 00:02:39,070
screen vomit and secretion.
Our featured characters,

47
00:02:39,071 --> 00:02:41,830
TV has so warped our understanding
of what life is like,

48
00:02:41,831 --> 00:02:45,970
that a semi realistic depiction of
poverty is the most disgusting thing this

49
00:02:45,971 --> 00:02:47,080
writer can even think of.

50
00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:57,010
I wonder, would it be like to live
there and have servants and valleys?

51
00:02:57,310 --> 00:03:01,980
Oh sure. People who tell you
to go and how to dress. Oh,

52
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:06,070
it's better than here. We're only
scraping for food, ducking the guards.

53
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:09,670
I understand that a movie about a genie
in a flying carpet doesn't also need to

54
00:03:09,671 --> 00:03:11,650
be a sober reflection on class structure,

55
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:15,130
but maybe it's weird to say the princesses
who are sick of being told what to do,

56
00:03:15,131 --> 00:03:16,300
have less to complain about that.

57
00:03:16,301 --> 00:03:19,720
A guy who in his own words has got
to eat to live, got to steal the eat,

58
00:03:19,721 --> 00:03:21,670
tell you all about it
when he's got the time.

59
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:25,240
Assistant Professor Jessie strive at Duke
University conducted a study of every

60
00:03:25,241 --> 00:03:29,470
g rated Disney movie to make over $100
million and found that the big theme is

61
00:03:29,471 --> 00:03:30,880
that inequality is benign.

62
00:03:30,881 --> 00:03:34,750
Proving that what I do for a living is
just like being a professor at Duke Mom.

63
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:35,620
Also,

64
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:38,920
thanks for watching mom and Snow White
and the seven dwarves sing their way to

65
00:03:38,921 --> 00:03:40,600
work every day.
The citizens of bells,

66
00:03:40,601 --> 00:03:44,740
quiet provincial town love living in the
crushing poverty of 17th century France.

67
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:47,650
I know that the point is supposed to
be that money can't buy happiness,

68
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:50,890
but it ends up being that the poor
on an even footing with the rich,

69
00:03:50,891 --> 00:03:55,240
which like I believe that's wrong.
You can probably find a study somewhere.

70
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:57,880
It's not just fairy tales and
the first iron man, Tony Stark.

71
00:03:57,881 --> 00:04:01,720
Nobody shuts down all weapons
manufacturing in his weapons manufacturing

72
00:04:01,721 --> 00:04:05,020
business and the TV tells him that
his entire corporation is doing,

73
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:08,380
but by the next movie
is closed or fancier.

74
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:11,830
His gadgets are only cooler and his
business is more profitable than ever.

75
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:15,400
Both daredevil in Sherlock are shows
about superheroes who live in really dope

76
00:04:15,401 --> 00:04:15,911
apartments,

77
00:04:15,911 --> 00:04:19,510
even though they only take cases they
find interesting or morally challenging in

78
00:04:19,511 --> 00:04:22,360
some way. Foggy in particular
is always worried about money,

79
00:04:22,361 --> 00:04:26,200
but only because he's the annoying fat
wrong character because who would worry

80
00:04:26,201 --> 00:04:27,940
about money? Oh, loser.

81
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:31,570
It's way better to just put on a
mask and punch whatever you see here.

82
00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:41,650
Did never owned a credit
card or leased a car. Nope.

83
00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:47,440
Mason, hey, not really. One in 10
Americans have a credit score of zero.

84
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:50,680
That's 45 million people
among folks Fiona's age.

85
00:04:50,681 --> 00:04:54,100
That number spikes to more like foreign
10 you can open up a credit card account,

86
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:57,460
take an advance of thousand
dollars paid back tomorrow,

87
00:04:57,461 --> 00:04:59,380
and you're an excellent credit risk.

88
00:04:59,530 --> 00:05:02,390
That's ridiculous to Fiona is
not an excellent credit risk.

89
00:05:02,391 --> 00:05:06,160
She has no payment history and no
long longterm accounts. You know,

90
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:10,450
78% of Americans don't know that length
of credit history is an important part

91
00:05:10,451 --> 00:05:12,880
of your score or that closing
off older accounts will hurt.

92
00:05:12,881 --> 00:05:17,490
That score just gave you
valuable financial advice
and this comedy video that he

93
00:05:17,491 --> 00:05:20,290
didn't see that coming and
full of surprises you love me.

94
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:23,380
Managing your credit properly
can give you a huge advantage,

95
00:05:23,381 --> 00:05:26,950
but only if you're the type of Weirdo
who likes to own cars or homes or not pay

96
00:05:26,951 --> 00:05:30,370
ridiculous interest rates. And remember,
shameless is the realistic show.

97
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:34,210
Let's go through some times
wacky characters casually
ruined their lives for a

98
00:05:34,211 --> 00:05:35,044
quick joke.

99
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:39,970
So let me know that.
Listen,

100
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,450
I already transferred to $3,000 balance
from the valley federal card over to my

101
00:05:43,451 --> 00:05:46,390
spring mills mutual card
because I had an $8,000 limit.

102
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,190
But since I'm already
bumping against that,

103
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:51,490
I muscle transferred everything to
yours because it has a $20,000 limit.

104
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:54,940
It's really visa,
Bill and bill up one of two.

105
00:05:54,970 --> 00:05:58,190
How I met your mother went out of their
way to make Lily's credit card debt a

106
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:00,860
season long problems so you'd
think they'd think it through,

107
00:06:01,010 --> 00:06:04,190
but in the end it just seemed like a point
of mild shame for the characters with

108
00:06:04,191 --> 00:06:06,920
no actual long term
consequences for their lives.

109
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:11,900
Buy designer clothes and
accessories that I can't afford.

110
00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:16,300
I have 15 credit cards and they're all
maxed out after Mahershala and Lilly

111
00:06:16,301 --> 00:06:19,310
bought an apartment at a
ridiculous 16% interest rate.

112
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:23,510
It turned out fine instead of the kind
of thing that would ruin you forever

113
00:06:23,511 --> 00:06:26,960
because Marshall just happened to stumble
into a killer high paying lawyer job,

114
00:06:26,961 --> 00:06:29,420
or the only downside is that
it's evil and crushing him.

115
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:32,960
Nevermind that most people would gladly
take an evil soul crushing job in

116
00:06:32,961 --> 00:06:36,950
exchange for benefits and
financial security because
the alternative is usually

117
00:06:36,951 --> 00:06:41,360
an evil soul crushing job that doesn't
have benefits or security and will also

118
00:06:41,361 --> 00:06:44,180
destroy you physically because you're
working with dangerous chemicals or Carter

119
00:06:44,181 --> 00:06:44,421
ground.

120
00:06:44,421 --> 00:06:48,440
Thousands of pounds of bricks like lifted
in his summer vacation in shameless.

121
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:50,690
Shameless is pretty good
for the most part, right?

122
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:54,440
It's not just me calling it the
best depiction of poverty and TV.

123
00:06:54,441 --> 00:06:57,650
So let's talk about how shameless
mix poor people look like dicks.

124
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:07,500
Like I touched on earlier, I love
this show. It's Rad, well-written,

125
00:07:07,501 --> 00:07:09,780
Emmy Rossum deserves every award,
et cetera.

126
00:07:09,810 --> 00:07:13,290
But also the main joke is how
awful the characters can be.

127
00:07:13,410 --> 00:07:15,600
Lip stealing the truckers.
Meat is just the beginning.

128
00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:19,020
There's also the time Kevin and Veronica
had a threesome with Veronica's mom.

129
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:22,200
The time Debbie lied to her boyfriend to
trick them into getting her pregnant at

130
00:07:22,201 --> 00:07:25,560
the time Frank's girlfriend jerked
lip off by touching his feet. Funny.

131
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:27,121
It's just weird.

132
00:07:27,121 --> 00:07:30,060
We'll have like whole arcs about
addiction and untreated mental illness and

133
00:07:30,061 --> 00:07:32,700
failed business ventures that
are treated really seriously,

134
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:36,060
but then they'll pay rent by lying about
their landlord being a pedophile and

135
00:07:36,061 --> 00:07:39,330
blackmailing him for it.
The show's gimmick is how gross it gets.

136
00:07:39,450 --> 00:07:43,170
And showtimes audience is mostly wealthy
people and they keep going for the

137
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:47,190
cheap laughs and I'm not proud of that
punt. So let's just finish up here.

138
00:07:53,230 --> 00:07:56,740
The overall message we're sending
is that money is easy to manage and

139
00:07:56,741 --> 00:07:59,140
unimportant and that poor
people are lazy and gross.

140
00:07:59,170 --> 00:08:00,790
I get this is all escape his fantasy,

141
00:08:00,791 --> 00:08:05,470
but finances are a pretty important topic
for everyone to consistently get this

142
00:08:05,471 --> 00:08:08,560
wrong. So the question is, what
do we do about it? You know,

143
00:08:08,590 --> 00:08:10,780
this is an important issue
and this is the Internet,

144
00:08:10,781 --> 00:08:14,800
so we've got to take it seriously.
I know I'll ask the shadow people.

145
00:08:14,801 --> 00:08:19,570
They seem to have, they're more or less
together. Come to me, my shadow friends,

146
00:08:19,810 --> 00:08:21,070
we have much to discuss.

147
00:08:25,450 --> 00:08:26,620
Hey,
thanks for watching our video.

148
00:08:26,621 --> 00:08:29,890
Hit the scene in the middle to subscribe
and hit the little bell to be notified

149
00:08:29,891 --> 00:08:31,090
when it was going to be more videos.

150
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:33,910
And then we have a comment
telling me what this does.

151
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:37,180
Nothing.
It doesn't do anything.
