Speaker 1:          00:01          Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:16          Who turned this on?

Speaker 1:          00:19          Oh, am I talking to no one here, but me and the shadow people. Welcome to reckless disagreement. The only show on the Internet you can trust. I'm your host. I'm slowly starving to death and myself made prison. And here's a clip from Buffy the vampire slayer where she discovers a dark secret about an evil corporation. The double meat medley is vegetables. How do you know that she's immediately offered a bribe? You want money but instead insists on taking a minimum wage job. I'd really like to not be fired anymore. Some context here, but for the vampire slayer is a vampire slayer and the only person standing between the citizens of Sunnydale and a sinister cessation of existence due to blood sucking every second she spends flipping burgers is a second. Some poor schmuck is getting, his hemoglobin is gobbled. People died because she was too virtuous to blackmail and multinational fast food chain for lying to their customers. And that is the moment that I realized that no one in Hollywood understands poverty or working for a living or even money far fetched. Right? Who could believe that? The notorious Lee down to earth and relatable billionaires of Hollywood hills could possibly,

Speaker 1:          01:19          you got it. You know where I'm going? Let's just get to it. Mana is going on. I am new owner of alibi. Well, we can't stay here. Not enough money in the kid and keep the lights on past midnight. What a B, a, B, and e. Somebody broke into the bar and Stoller seeing kids after getting laid off. I was finally pursuing my lifelong dream, starting my own architecture firm. You know what really grinds my gears? The fact that there is no point in the TV characters life or they're terrible decisions catch up to them. It's just wacky adventures and gross and competence and then they go home every day to an amazing apartment because I guess they started a gogurt commercial ones. There's still air in that spot. Yeah, dude covered my rent for years. Now gogurt comes through. Let's talk about the amazing home Ted marshland share.

Speaker 1:          02:08          Sharon, how I met your mother and it's like a thought. We don't really need to talk about it. Looking at it, it's probably sufficient for this point. You're smart. Your brain can draw conclusions from simple images. The most interesting example has got to be the show shameless, which is, let's be clear, an amazing show, but take a look at the house they live in. So a lot of people live in the real world. Probably the most realistic come I've ever seen on TV, but listen to what flood magazine has to say about it. Shameless is raw, honest, and dark. The audience can practically smell the Fed marsh of its settings through the screen vomit and secretion. Our featured characters, TV has so warped our understanding of what life is like, that a semi realistic depiction of poverty is the most disgusting thing this writer can even think of.

Speaker 1:          02:52          I wonder, would it be like to live there and have servants and valleys? Oh sure. People who tell you to go and how to dress. Oh, it's better than here. We're only scraping for food, ducking the guards. I understand that a movie about a genie in a flying carpet doesn't also need to be a sober reflection on class structure, but maybe it's weird to say the princesses who are sick of being told what to do, have less to complain about that. A guy who in his own words has got to eat to live, got to steal the eat, tell you all about it when he's got the time. Assistant Professor Jessie strive at Duke University conducted a study of every g rated Disney movie to make over $100 million and found that the big theme is that inequality is benign. Proving that what I do for a living is just like being a professor at Duke Mom.

Speaker 1:          03:35          Also, thanks for watching mom and Snow White and the seven dwarves sing their way to work every day. The citizens of bells, quiet provincial town love living in the crushing poverty of 17th century France. I know that the point is supposed to be that money can't buy happiness, but it ends up being that the poor on an even footing with the rich, which like I believe that's wrong. You can probably find a study somewhere. It's not just fairy tales and the first iron man, Tony Stark. Nobody shuts down all weapons manufacturing in his weapons manufacturing business and the TV tells him that his entire corporation is doing, but by the next movie is closed or fancier. His gadgets are only cooler and his business is more profitable than ever. Both daredevil in Sherlock are shows about superheroes who live in really dope apartments, even though they only take cases they find interesting or morally challenging in some way. Foggy in particular is always worried about money, but only because he's the annoying fat wrong character because who would worry about money? Oh, loser. It's way better to just put on a mask and punch whatever you see here.

Speaker 1:          04:37          Did never owned a credit card or leased a car. Nope. Mason, hey, not really. One in 10 Americans have a credit score of zero. That's 45 million people among folks Fiona's age. That number spikes to more like foreign 10 you can open up a credit card account, take an advance of thousand dollars paid back tomorrow, and you're an excellent credit risk. That's ridiculous to Fiona is not an excellent credit risk. She has no payment history and no long longterm accounts. You know, 78% of Americans don't know that length of credit history is an important part of your score or that closing off older accounts will hurt. That score just gave you valuable financial advice and this comedy video that he didn't see that coming and full of surprises you love me. Managing your credit properly can give you a huge advantage, but only if you're the type of Weirdo who likes to own cars or homes or not pay ridiculous interest rates. And remember, shameless is the realistic show. Let's go through some times wacky characters casually ruined their lives for a quick joke.

Speaker 1:          05:37          So let me know that. Listen, I already transferred to $3,000 balance from the valley federal card over to my spring mills mutual card because I had an $8,000 limit. But since I'm already bumping against that, I muscle transferred everything to yours because it has a $20,000 limit. It's really visa, Bill and bill up one of two. How I met your mother went out of their way to make Lily's credit card debt a season long problems so you'd think they'd think it through, but in the end it just seemed like a point of mild shame for the characters with no actual long term consequences for their lives. Buy designer clothes and accessories that I can't afford. I have 15 credit cards and they're all maxed out after Mahershala and Lilly bought an apartment at a ridiculous 16% interest rate. It turned out fine instead of the kind of thing that would ruin you forever because Marshall just happened to stumble into a killer high paying lawyer job, or the only downside is that it's evil and crushing him. Nevermind that most people would gladly take an evil soul crushing job in exchange for benefits and financial security because the alternative is usually an evil soul crushing job that doesn't have benefits or security and will also destroy you physically because you're working with dangerous chemicals or Carter ground. Thousands of pounds of bricks like lifted in his summer vacation in shameless. Shameless is pretty good for the most part, right? It's not just me calling it the best depiction of poverty and TV. So let's talk about how shameless mix poor people look like dicks.

Speaker 1:          07:03          Like I touched on earlier, I love this show. It's Rad, well-written, Emmy Rossum deserves every award, et cetera. But also the main joke is how awful the characters can be. Lip stealing the truckers. Meat is just the beginning. There's also the time Kevin and Veronica had a threesome with Veronica's mom. The time Debbie lied to her boyfriend to trick them into getting her pregnant at the time Frank's girlfriend jerked lip off by touching his feet. Funny. It's just weird. We'll have like whole arcs about addiction and untreated mental illness and failed business ventures that are treated really seriously, but then they'll pay rent by lying about their landlord being a pedophile and blackmailing him for it. The show's gimmick is how gross it gets. And showtimes audience is mostly wealthy people and they keep going for the cheap laughs and I'm not proud of that punt. So let's just finish up here.

Speaker 1:          07:53          The overall message we're sending is that money is easy to manage and unimportant and that poor people are lazy and gross. I get this is all escape his fantasy, but finances are a pretty important topic for everyone to consistently get this wrong. So the question is, what do we do about it? You know, this is an important issue and this is the Internet, so we've got to take it seriously. I know I'll ask the shadow people. They seem to have, they're more or less together. Come to me, my shadow friends, we have much to discuss. Hey, thanks for watching our video. Hit the scene in the middle to subscribe and hit the little bell to be notified when it was going to be more videos. And then we have a comment telling me what this does.

Speaker 3:          08:36          Nothing. It doesn't do anything.
