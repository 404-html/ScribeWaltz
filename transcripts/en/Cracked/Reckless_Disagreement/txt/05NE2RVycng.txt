Speaker 1:          00:01          Yeah. Welcome to reckless disagreement. The only show on the Internet that you can trust. I'm your host, a paranoid recluse. And here's a clip from Raiders of the lost Ark.

Speaker 2:          00:24          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:27          Now, when I saw that scene as a kid, I just assumed that that's how grown ups got drunk after they made me go to bed. But when I grew up and started drinking on my own, I realized that if you tried to play a drinking game like that, you would die. I'm meticulous. Research tells me that it takes 30 minutes to feel the effects of alcohol. So if you're taking shots up until the second that you collapse on the floor, you're going to keep getting more drunk. So this sweaty fat man isn't just passing out, is falling into a coma. Marian Ravenwood just killed that

Speaker 2:          00:51          guy

Speaker 1:          00:55          and then she killed that guy. This made me realize no one who makes movies has ever been drunk somehow. So I decided that I would get drunk and explained to them all the mistakes they're making. All right, let's see. Uh, that's not right. They're supposed to be, oh, there's a title. Aw, it's gorgeous. And I love it. Raiders isn't the only movie that thinks this is how drinking games work and the two towers legless and Gimley engaged in a drinking game with only three rules. So it's a drinking. No, that's just drinking game implies like ping pong balls or underwear, right? This is the only drinking game. Anyone in movies ever replays and even happens in four we fought, he made his ancestors proud. I admit I'm not a viking, but how does drinking so much that your buddy has to carry you home, make anybody proud of you? This game only makes sense if your perspective on drinking is limited to sing. People leave for and returned from the bar and you're just trying to guess what went on in between to turn your friends into pukey bags of shame. Well, you guessed wrong movies, you guessed real wrong, and you should be ashamed

Speaker 1:          02:17          in movies, bars, the place you go when you're just itching for an excuse to explode into a whirlwind of gritty fisticuffs. There's so many examples that I'm just going to stick to movies. I love like the guests, dirty work, Deadpool, and I'd be kind of an idiot if I didn't at least mention roadhouse.

Speaker 2:          02:48          Okay. Okay.

Speaker 1:          02:50          Now show me another clip from dirty work. Oh, nice. Stone Street bike, man. You just hit g eight.

Speaker 2:          03:00          Yeah, if you like,

Speaker 1:          03:03          now I'm getting here. Rock bar fights happen and they're always hilarious. But your average dive bar isn't the time bomb of homophobia waiting to be set off by a guy with dreamy eyes ordering a blowjob shot at the blue. Not every bar fight I've ever seen. It was just a couple of drunk dudes grappling with each other and spelling my drink and to the bouncer kicked it off. And you know what to all the people writing comments about how bad ass the bar fights you've been in are, who are you trying to impress is in me? Oh, I'm flooding. Keep uh, keep, uh, yeah, keep doing that.

Speaker 2:          03:33          Okay.

Speaker 1:          03:38          So we'll just afford to drinks on me.

Speaker 1:          03:48          I am completely sure that nothing like that has ever happened in all of history. I've worked in a bar and I don't even know how you'd do that as a bartender. Nothing important. Wait, as the guy who offered to buy the rounds, not paying for the beer, what I might be wrong about this. I mean when I worked in a bar, I was 17 and the bartender and used to give me a six pack. When I did a good job, nothing's going to shut down. The effects might be related, but they also make me question this scene from Skyfall, it was just happened. Did bond walk in there with a Scorpion and say, hey, everyone watched this or does a bartender habit waiting there would have anybody who isn't James Bond order's this cocktail like say a drunk me and get stung and dies. Is the reputation for being the bar with the Scorpions worth the hassle of disposing of dead bodies and the effort it takes to feed and maintain a terrarium of deadly Arachnids? No, no. It's not. Next entry movies think beer makes you hallucinate.

Speaker 2:          04:59          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          05:02          not to Brag, but I've been really drunk before. I've gone on journeys of inebriated self discovery and I feed on cop cars, but I've never been so drunk that I hallucinated something that wasn't there because alcohol's effect is the opposite of that. I'm pretty sure this joke comes from the scene and Pinocchio, Pinocchio sees all his friends turning into donkeys and he slowly pushes away his glass of beer because he just figured out that that'll turn him into a donkey to, but everyone in Hollywood assume that Pinocchio thought the beer was making him hallucinate because they've never been drunk before. So let me be clear, Hollywood, if you want to see things that aren't there, you're going to have to do what the rest of us do and go make friends with someone with a snake tattoo. But if movie booze isn't helping you trip out, it's giving you special powers and the Big Bang theory, which none of you watch.

Speaker 1:          05:44          But all of you know about a character named Raj can only talk to women when he's drunk. Then he can talk to him. Fine. Like a normy. Well, the red a simulation, that's not a wacky joke about shyness. That's a serious drinking, kind of like what Tom Cruise has in the last Samurai until the Samurai. Just like take his booze away for a couple of days and he wakes up cure not just of his addiction but also of pts. Ah, how peaceful the nature, the trees, their sobriety. Japan has cured me. I am so good at being Japanese. I am the Last Samurai IRS my kidneys.

Speaker 2:          06:24          Okay.

Speaker 1:          06:27          All right. Uh, well all the lights were out there. Someone just informed me that lots of people drink and uh, my thesis is ridiculous. Fine. Thanks Kevin. And I mentioned that earlier, but uh, even so let's take stock of how Hollywood drinks first they chuck, then they fight. Then the inconvenience of bartender and then the Scorpion that might not even be there before quitting drinking forever and move into Japan. That's not healthy. That's an unsustainable way to live. You got to sort this out in movies. That's what I'm really, well sure. Roles. But in the top of the way to end it though, I guess let's try,

Speaker 3:          07:14          Hey, you like stand up, come see the cracked standup show. It's happening June 22nd at meltdown comics in Los Angeles.
