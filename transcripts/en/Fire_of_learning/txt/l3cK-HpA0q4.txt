Speaker 1:          00:00          Humans are having a major impact on the earth's climate and not much of it is good for us. Disappear species go extinct and we've already raised the Earth's temperature by about one degree Celsius. That might not seem like a lot, but it is. It's a huge jump in just the past 250 years and scientists and world leaders have agreed that two degrees Celsius is the upper limit before four things become more intense. Yet we're predicted to reach four degrees Celsius by the year 2100 faced with this information, many of us show concern yet find frustration with government were slow to act and corporations who are even slower to act. So here are 10 ways that you can take action. Number one, reduce electricity when you're not using something such as lights or computer, your television, etc. Turn it off. Furthermore, if not inconvenient, unplug it as low.

Speaker 1:          00:51          Your lights may be off. They may still use energy if they're plugged in this method, like many other methods, we will mention in this video we'll also help you save money. Number two, recycle. This is an obvious but overlooks method. We're using plastic, paper, cardboard, glass, metal, et Cetera. We'll save huge amounts in the energy that was expended in harvesting these resources, which if not recycled, may simply go to waste. If you don't have neighborhood recycling final recycling center near you, this will reduce landfill pollution, deforestation, and many other harmful things to our environment. Number three, buy local food or grow your own. Not only this, transporting food critic significant amount of pollution, but industrial agriculture also release this as a significant amount of greenhouse gas and pesticides harmful to the environment. Buying local food or having a garden is a healthy choice for both you and the environment.

Speaker 1:          01:45          Number four, use reusable water bottles. Instead of buying water bottles, you use a reusable wants to cut down on plastic use. Most bottled water is not that much healthier than tap water, but if you're still concerned, I would recommend buying a water filter and just try to make sure that this water bottle is BPA free as BPA has been linked to cancer. Number Five, change your transportation habits. Millions of people traveling from place to place each day as responsible for a huge amounts of greenhouse gas emission. Considered driving instead of flying. Consider taking public transportation instead of driving. Consider walking or riding a bike as your best way to not produce greenhouse gas and stay in shape. Number six, consider using a clothes line. It may seem old fashioned, but your washer and dryer are some of the biggest consumers of energy in your house. Cuts down on this energy use by letting your clothes dry out in the sun.

Speaker 1:          02:38          Number seven, keep warm with clothing or blankets in the winter. Consider turning your thermostat down and cooler temperatures and instead wearing warmer clothing each degree above 70 degrees Fahrenheit, maybe responsible for around 7% of extra energy output. Number eight's grow plants. Plants not only turned carbon dioxide into oxygen, but much of the plant itself is made out of carbon taken from the air. Having indoor or outdoor plants, letting your yard go out a little bit or finding a space to plant a tree are all excellent ways of helping. Number nine, reduce water usage. Wasted water is especially bad for the environment in many parts of the world. Can't afford to wastewater. Turn off water when you're not using it and try to use as little as possible by turning off on use faucets, reducing shower times of five to 10 minutes and running dishwashers or washing machines.

Speaker 1:          03:29          Only one completely full. Number 10 get involved. Finding local organizations dedicated to protecting the environment by reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Protecting forests and endangered species and more is a great way to increase your positive environmental influence. Contacting politicians, protesting and raising awareness are all effective ways of change. By implementing these methods, we can make a difference. As real change starts with the individual person taking action together, we can save our planet for more videos on a wide range of subjects.
