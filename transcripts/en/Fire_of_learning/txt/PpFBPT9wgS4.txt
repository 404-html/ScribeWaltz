Speaker 1:          00:17          Scientist working with NASA's Kepler telescope believe they may have discover what may be the most earth like clone at the date Kepler for 50 to be orbits. It start at a very similar distance at earth orbits. It's star. In fact, it's here is only 20 days longer. It is likely a rocky planet for ups. A billion years old was in the eras, 60% larger in 1400 light years away in the constellation sickness because this world has been an orbit around its star for around 6 billion years in the habitable zone, scientists are hopeful that life has evolved in flourished here. In fact, they're calling it the best chance so far under just several earth like planets discovered, including capita 20 to be scientist or not sure if the planner host life and because it is 1400 layers away, who not like they'd be a certain for a decent amount of time.

Speaker 1:          01:03          Though they were saying that plant's transported here from Earth would likely be able to survive and someone could receive a healthy tan. How healthy you have. A 10 though is yet to be determined as again, much of the planet is still unknown as well as completely redefining or understanding of biology and a universe, Kepler, 42 B, and they provide insight on the future of earth due to its greater age and its similarity to our planet Kepler for 50 to be maybe our best hope for Iti to date that may indeed be among billions and billions of life harboring planets in the universe in the end. Only a time and perseverance hotel. What do you think? So could there be life on this world? Would it be intelligent?
