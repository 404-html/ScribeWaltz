Speaker 1:          00:00          Hello and welcome to fire of learning. I'm Justin and back in December I told you guys that if you left any comments, questions, concerns, suggestions, et Cetera, on a video, I did ask him for them that I would get around to answering them and January or so and so here we are in mid January, looking at the rest of 2018 a few things I want to discuss before I get to your actual question. So firstly, two of the most common complaints I get is that I talk too quickly and I talked to monotonously. I agree that's been an issue and I understand that this is a pain, especially to people who don't speak English as a first language, but I've made use of this criticism and I take my narration in my videos over recent months has improved significantly. Though of course I will continue to improve on my narration skills as the channel progress's.

Speaker 1:          00:48          Secondly, another complaint that I get is that I have an agenda or a bias in my videos. I get these comments particularly on obviously political or historical videos and things like that. I really don't think that I do to the extent that people accused me of, I think that's just something that anyone on youtube we'll get accused of when they discuss controversial subjects. And I think the most that assures me that I'm not letting a bias slip into my videos is that I have videos for example, that have been called both rightwing trash and left this nonsense. It's not really correct to say that I leave my opinions out of my videos. I will admit to a number of things, like I might say, unfortunately 500 people died in this event and someone might think unfortunately is that uh, it was an opinion on the matter will yet be caught me.

Speaker 1:          01:32          I think death is unfortunate, but beyond that I only really add my personal opinions to things when I think it would help a lesson. Like I may, like I may overtly state that I think philosophy is as important as science. That's a video that I did on a complete opinion, but stating my opinion opens the door. Let's stay in the opinion and making the argument that I made opens the door for a large amount of philosophical conversations to take place on this channel. Furthermore, I don't subliminally just insert my opinions into videos. My opinions on things when I share them are right up front and I encourage you guys to disagree with me because I think debate helps the learning process. Most importantly, I avoid sharing my opinions on them on politics or economics or a number of social or religious or whatever issues. I'm not afraid to talk about these things.

Speaker 1:          02:20          We've talked about them already quite frequently, but when I do, I make an effort to present all sides equally, fairly and objectively and often even when I do share my opinion, I do give fair consideration to the opposite argument. Why a, you guys aren't coming here to consider me for Congress. You're here to talk about some cool stuff slipping in my own perspective as fact just makes it unappealing. You know, that being said, if it seems like I make a mistake or it seems like I inserted buys or you don't understand something, tell me in the comments. If you're mad that I'm not pandering to your specific view of things, that that's just too bad. You're going to have to get over that. That's not how I work and that's not fair or intellectually honest. Take it somewhere else, but if I am doing something wrong, I appreciate your guys', his corrections.

Speaker 1:          03:02          I make an effort to listen to you guys and be bias information is all that's out there these days. You go to school, maybe you read the news, you watch other youtube channels and there's just an obvious amount of half truths and bias and flat out lies and things like that that are intentionally inserted to reinforce some agenda and not to just talk about something for its own sake. It's not hard to see. In fact, it's hard to get away from, I don't know about you, but it pisses me off when people can be intellectually dishonest with a straight face. You can't trust anything and I'm not saying it's all one side. Every side seems to do it. Even people I agree with it seem to do it, but I still think it's wrong. Fire of learning is a small channel, but I like to think that we are unique in an approach of meat or at least uncommon in an approach of me just attempting to present information objectively and fairly and not trying to get in the way of you thinking for yourself while a lot of other channels out there, even other educational channels really don't respect that.

Speaker 1:          03:59          You know their presents, similar information that makes similar videos but they want you to think about things from a certain perspective and I think that's dumb. I think people who go out of their way to watch educational youtube videos are smart enough to think for themselves. Anyway, that was probably kind of a long side rant, but I felt it was necessary to reiterate bottom line, some of my opinions do come out. I think philosophy is as important as science. I think colonizing Mars would be great. I think Picard is the better captain, but I do make an effort to make my videos fair and objective and I think my opinions don't get in the way, or at least I hope they do not have you thinking for yourself. The only agenda here at fire learning as promoting the idea that education makes the world go round and that understanding the universe is one of the most important pursuits of life any way.

Speaker 1:          04:48          Now to your specific questions, Mark Benjamin, you have three comments here. The first explain the difference between the schools of economics. Secondly, can you teach cryptocurrency and financial slash bank history including gold and silver? Thirdly, would you be, would you be having a steam@dotcomormines.com channel your first question? Yes. Economics is something I haven't really gotten into much beyond my political compass video, but it is something I have been meaning to cover just because economics is so central to how we live our lives and how the world works. Second, absolutely. I actually own some bitcoin and silver and that sort of thing. I'd be glad to make some videos on those topics and their histories. Thirdly, I'm not familiar with those websites. I could look into them, but I have a fire of learning Facebook and Instagram that I admittedly only semi keep up with, so not entirely sure what I'll be doing with that.

Speaker 1:          05:42          I guess Tj Johnson, thanks for what you do. Live long and prosper. Thank you TJ. Live long and prosper as well. Maria. Colin, my life moves at a pace faster than that of the Internet, so unfortunately I do not have any useful intelligence for you at this time. The Best I can offer you is good luck and keep doing what you're doing. Thank you Maria. I appreciate that. Don't move too fast though. Be sure to stop and smell the roses sometimes. Devonish Cytopenia I hope I'm pronouncing that correctly. The first video I watched was top 10 lessons by Niccolo Machiavelli after that or realize that you have a video about evolution as well and that wasn't really a good representation. I really appreciate the content you post and the inflammation is of great quality and helpful. Now I want to talk about a few things that I felt could be better.

Speaker 1:          06:28          Your representations mostly consists of pictures, although it's debatable that people might like that, but I felt switching to videos would be a great improvement if you could. I would also suggest that you add some background ambient music. It goes a long way and makes me get my eyes and mind peeled into the video. I hope you take the suggestions constructively. I really liked his channel. I hope you keep making amazing and informative videos like these video ideas. One top three or five strangers, planets were stars and the local group or Milky Way Galaxy or the universe to you could start a series on a particular topic like about great minds like Nikola Tesla, Alan Watts and others. Three top 10 innovations that changed the world for a top 10 books for personality development or to rethink our lifestyle. They get a bunch. I appreciate that. Regarding the pictures, I'm not going to lie this things with the thing with pictures of that they're easier to use.

Speaker 1:          07:20          I have used videos for space or history of videos and that in a few of my videos, but the thing is that they are much more protected and liked to get taken down. I've considered making my own videos in terms of like drawings or me speaking on camera, but I'm not much of an artist and the pictures are more interesting and helpful than just me and my room for an entire 30 minutes. If you guys would be cool with it, I could like get some friends together and go out into the field and dress up as mongers or something from an ex history video, make a film, something with my phone camera or something like that. Music is similar situation. Not a lot of royalty free stuff out there. I have used it in the past but implementing it in a 50 minute video or something like that would be just difficult.

Speaker 1:          08:04          But if you guys want me to I could handle that. I like those video ideas. The, I think the top 10 tips videos that I do do a decent job on the surface level of exploring how some great minds thought, but I would be glad to do entire videos on like very influential and profound people throughout history like biography type videos. I did one on Isaac Newton way back in 2015 if you can handle my early narration skills and the awful audio quality, but the information itself is a decent enough. David [inaudible] I subscribed because I liked your history videos and it would be great to see more of them, but I've enjoyed some of your linguistics and space videos too. I'm not as interested in your more American stuff like politicians, Saint Patrick, Halloween, US history, et Cetera, but I'm Australian so it's fairly irrelevant to me.

Speaker 1:          08:57          Anyway, thanks for all your great work. Thank you David. That's a very great comment because I was actually meaning to mention that I obviously am an American. A lot of my viewers are from the USA. A few of my videos are targeted specifically to an American audience, but I do my best to keep in mind that I am speaking to an international community, so videos that appeal to Australians and New Zealanders and Englishman and Canadians and such are on their way along side the American side. Videos that I do, I definitely do have more history but it was coming and I have actually been thinking about doing some stuff on the history of Australia and New Zealand and stuff like that because a sizable amount of my viewers are such as herself from those countries. Christian Rayez. I know that you already tread on the NBTI path, but I would really like it if you could do actually do videos on individual types.

Speaker 1:          09:45          I found her other type videos so illuminating that I would like to hear a more in depth analysis on specific NBTI types or even type comparisons. Eg I NFJ versus IFP. Thank you for that. Christian. I tried to highlight aspects of individual types in the group videos that I did, but I could definitely do some videos on individual types as well. I also liked the idea of type comparisons that could be interesting. I did an overview of the entire NBTI subject as a kind of introduction to personality psychology and journalists since it was something that was popular among people and it's something that I like and have very much locked into. My defense video in particular was partially me saying, you know, the NBTI isn't just astrology for people who watch Rick and Morty. It isn't perfect, but it has some substance to it, some credibility it's worth looking at, but it was also partially me responding to an even bigger nonsense idea that you can't quantify personality.

Speaker 1:          10:39          There are people, and I displayed them in the video who are tearing apart a lot of what psychology shows for no valid reason other than what is, in my opinion, trying to avoid hurting people's feelings, which is not to be tolerated in science, but anyway, I'm not going to ramble on about that. I just wanted to say that the NBTI stuff was a part of a much larger project of psychology that I want to cover on this channel. What I want to do with the NBTI from here is to look at why people are the ways that they are, why we have the personality traits we do. You know for, you know, your example in IFP in and I have Jay and I, NFP is an introverted feeler and inf j as an extroverted via, but why do those differences exist? What is, for example, what we call introverted feeling?

Speaker 1:          11:25          Why do the characteristics that make up what we define as introverted feeling exist? What's going on in the brain? What personality traits are we born with? What do we develop? How do these types compare to something like the big five or other models and things of that nature. But yes, definitely videos like the ones who suggested here are definitely in the future. Chest and Blankenship, I'd like to see some more things over more modern wars like world war two and the evolution of languages. Modern wars in history, absolutely very relevant and very important, especially in what we choose to do with our futures. I have plans to address recent history coming up pretty soon actually. Evolution of languages. I love languages and I love the evolution of languages and at a mall g and things like that. I've talked about pieces of the history of some languages, like particularly English and several of my videos, probably the most I've done analyzing the history of English specifically is in my video is English the hardest language to learn.

Speaker 1:          12:22          But I honestly hate that video because it's cringy and dumb and I honestly on to keep it up because my girlfriend and joy's it for that reason. But other videos, looking at languages and things like that are definitely coming. Joseph Mcdevitt to know nothing of what happened before you were born is to remain forever a child. Cicero, keep up the good work. Very well said. Joseph, thank you. I will try to do so Aaron, maybe do some more NBTI videos to get some subscribers, maybe debunking some conspiracy theories or flat earth. I think that should bring some strange people in Austin. Maybe not personally. I would like an evolution one, a one series. Like I said, I'll be mentioning the NBTI and the future for sure, and I'll be talking more broadly about psychology for sure. If you guys want more videos on the NBTI specifically, I'd be happy to make them conspiracy theories.

Speaker 1:          13:11          Well, you know, strange people come around no matter what. That's just the beauty of the Internet. People can be more vocal here than in person and that includes strange people. Something like the flat earth isn't really believed by a concerning amount of people, but I still be glad to debunk it. Conspiracy theories like that are interesting and that they make you think, oh, how can we be sure that the earth has around? And you learn a little bit from that question. That initially seems nonsensical. So a video on the subject is worthwhile, even if it's not a serious threat to messing with the population. Probably more concerning conspiracy theories are those surrounding water fluoridation or GMOs or things like that. And I do plan to address those things regardless of the interesting people that they will attract. I mean, interesting people have already been attracted to channel.

Speaker 1:          14:00          There's, there's no going back. Evolution. One O one biology is one of my favorite subjects. Genetics is one of my favorite subjects. Videos like that are definitely on the way. Frank COPCO, I would love to learn about the history of Prussia. Slash Brandenburg. I was born in Berlin and have seen difficulty in finding history in Australia about this. It seems that the German people and historians in that part of the world are still being browbeaten over World War II and are therefore reticent to speak of expansionist policies. I find especially in your histories, English one in particular that you are very fair and even in your summation of attributing blame for World War One and World War II and therefore eagerly anticipate your postings. Thank you for a great year of learning a day spent without learning something is a day wasted. Happy New Year. Docushare and frank, I would very much like to do a history on pressure.

Speaker 1:          14:50          It's a similar situation here in the United States where when you say German history people only think of world war one and two but German history extends as you know of course long before that and that history deserves to be remembered. So yes, definitely something coming on that. I appreciate the compliment. I try my hardest to be as fair as possible. Happy New Year to you as well. Mr M your video is our appreciative sir. Thank you. Thank you mister em. I appreciate that there are more videos on the way Gordon do more videos like the one on England, the full history of countries and empires existing and fallen. For example, the Normans as I speak. I actually have a full history video of a nation like the one I did with England and the works and I plan on making plenty more throughout the year. The Normans I've talked about in my viking documentary and my England documentary though I've never really focused on them individually, but I can definitely do that in the future.

Speaker 1:          15:44          They're an interesting topic to cover, but yeah, expect to see more full history videos coming up and expect to see one soon. Jakey d 25 I really like your videos. Thank you. Thank you, Jackie Dia. I appreciate that there are plenty more on the way. Thank you for all those comments, questions and concerns and things like that. If you guys have thought of any more the comments section in this video and all my other ones are always open. I tried to read as many comments as I can and if you guys want me to do another like Q and a type thing I would definitely be open to doing is promoting is like this and videos on many other subjects. Be sure to check out fire of learning and subscribe. Thank you for watching.
