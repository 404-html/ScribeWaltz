Speaker 1:          00:00          Hello and welcome the fire of learning Britain from a small island nation to the largest empire the world has ever seen an empire upon which the sun did not set and in technicality still does nuts set. How was this achieved? What was the secret to Britain's success in empire building? Well, to begin, one of the first big reasons for Britain success was geography from the start of the nation. England was protected from the conflicts and interests of the continent by being surrounded on all sides by water. Well, almost all sides. You may remember Edward Longshanks ranting about not controlling the whole of his island in the movie Braveheart and his frustration was completely justified if the island where unified it would provide an important strategic advantage for England getting whales and especially Scotland, who was historically an enemy of England and worst and ally of the arch nemesis, France off their backs.

Speaker 1:          01:00          This was essentially achieved in 1603 when King James became the monarch of England, Scotland and Ireland and England started to become Britain. Giving it a complete shield of sea water is a nice advantage. It makes it harder for enemies to come into your territory if they must also travel by sea, but C's are not impenetrable and the English learned that lesson the hard way. Early on in the early Middle Ages, the English went up against the power with a superior navy. The Vikings, the vikings spread havoc on England and nearly conquered the Anglo Saxon kingdoms entirely though eventually thrown off, only to be conquered by half biking group known as the Normans. The English understood that to protect our nation, they would have to invest in a powerful navy. As the centuries progressed, that navy saved their country on multiple occasions, including during the failed invasion of the Spanish armada.

Speaker 1:          01:56          During the English Spanish wars and the battle of Trafalgar and the Napoleonic wars as Edward Gray would later say, the British army should be a projectile to be fired by the British navy. The stress that the English began placing on our navy in the late Middle Ages and renaissance came at the ideal time. The perspective that Europeans had of the world was expanding as the Americas, Africa and Asia were being explored and the way to get to these places was by sea. The English had the scramble, the Ketchup to the Portuguese and Spanish, but when they did, they were active participants of rising trade exploration and colonialism. Britain was now on the playing field to dominate the world though rivaled by other powers like France, Spain, Portugal, the Netherlands, and Russia on these new confidence for centuries to the Europeans advantage, the natives of these regions were less technologically advanced, lacked unification, and were susceptible to things like diseases.

Speaker 1:          02:54          However, it would be a struggle for Britain to become top dog in the world. Empire game in the 18th century though, controlling much of the Americas, Spain, and Portugal is power began to decline. The Netherlands were knocked out of the game significantly in the 17th century along with Scandinavia. Russia expansion was not fueled by a strong navy and was therefore a focused mostly on lands which were connected to its own. Austria was too burdened by mainland conflict and Italy and Germany lacked true unification until the 19th century. This left France as Britain's main enemy in the 18th century. Britain and France fought it out over the course of the 18th century and a series of almost constant war than conflicts. One of the most important conflicts of this era and in world history being a seven years' war in America and Canada, the seven years' war as often downplayed as merely the French and Indian war, the war between Britain and the French and a native allies.

Speaker 1:          03:53          But it was much more than that. It involved all major European powers at the time. It was fought on all continents except Oceania and Antarctica. And in many ways it was the first real world war and the site of the future of North America and South Asia. When Britain secured his presence and influence of her friends and he's regions following the French and Indian war. However, Britain took a major setback in the late 18th century when it lost some of its most important colonies, the 13 in North America, which became the United States after throwing off British rule, an event which was encouraged and received an important assistance from Britain's arch nemesis, France. Though this was crippling, Britain bounced back that century as it retained other important colonies like Canada and expanded into Australia, India, and other parts of Asia. All while France struggled to recoup the for France could recover.

Speaker 1:          04:50          Though it underwent a decade long revolution, which spilled over into other parts of Europe and threatened not only British possessions like Ireland, but also the British government itself. When the revolution ended, it did so under the rule of Napoleon who said about conquering the whole continent and had a specific interest in Britain. Though Napoleon's invasion of Britain failed. As I said, France remained a critical threat on which Britain focused its resources and tried to rally the continent against for over a decade. While in the poem was having great success on the main continent, he did fail with Francis, former colonial possessions. He reclaimed Louisiana only to sell it to the United States and lost Haiti to a slave uprising for the more he failed to challenge Britain and other parts of the world leaving the path the colonizing these places open to Britain when Napoleon was eventually to feed it, it paid off greatly for Britain as it entered into what is called Pax Britannica, a period of relative peace among Europeans.

Speaker 1:          05:51          In 1812 the empire struck back against the U s and the war of 1812 though this ended in a stalemate following this war, Britain made a tactically wise decision and pursued neutrality and eventually friendship with the United States allowing Canada to be essentially unbothered by American power, which would begin to grow in the 19th century, but pose no threat to other parts of the British empire. This is not as say that Britain had an open road to the world empire. It was becoming France. Though setback was still in the game. Germany was on the horizon and would be a major competitor to Britain. Britain also had to compete with Russia and the Middle East and Far East, and what is known as the great game. Japan and China proved to be industrious and powerful nations, et Cetera, but by the 19th century, the British empire, his position as world power was established.

Speaker 1:          06:45          It ruled Canada, New Zealand, Australia, and India relatively safely. The crumbling Ottoman Empire allowed a route to expand into the fragmented Middle East and the Conquest of Africa was shared in an organized by many European powers. The first great threat to the British Empire came in the 20th century with World War One which did in fact wound Britain greatly, but ultimately led to the expansion of its empire achieving its apex and 1920 not even a century ago, and controlling one quarter of the entire planet's land mass and population. To summarize Britain's geographical advantage, it's rule over the whole of its island. It's emphasis on having the most powerful navy in the world. It's investment in trade and exploration. It's dry if to colonize the world. It's victories in wars against contenders, such as in the seven years war and the avoidance of issues that other mainland nations face, such as men and conflicts allowed it this serious advantage.

Speaker 1:          07:43          Also, keep in mind that science and technology were embraced in Britain early on. For example, the industrial revolution began in England. Britain's power fell after the Second World War, which damages Europe and cause massive decolonization and independence movements across the world, which led to the official end of the empire in 1997 but its influence on the world remains on matched and its legacy on beaten.
