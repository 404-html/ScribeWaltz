Speaker 1:          00:00          The United States of America is a relatively new nation, haven't been founded only a few hundred years ago. However, despite its youth, it has quickly risen to become a world power and has had and currently has a major impact on economics, politics, technology and science, the arts, culture, and other aspects of society across the entire globe. What began as English settlements on the coast of a world unknown to the settlers would come to conquer that world and rise to claim the title of world's superpower. In the meantime, the nation would change considerably as it expanded and forge an identity, and in this video we're going to discuss that identity and the history. So let's get to it. The land we call the United States today had been inhabited by various native American peoples as long before its existence. These people were to send it from a group of Eurasians across the Bering Land Bridge about 16,000 years ago.

Speaker 1:          00:53          Many of them develop some considerably complex societies, which would cross paths with the Europeans and their expansion into the region. However, the United States is politically, economically, socially, and culturally much more to send it from European, the native American elements, Americans and native Americans consider their histories separate up until the intertwining of the two and the histories of the various indigenous peoples before the USA will be covered in depth. In future videos, Americans typically begin their country's story with the voyages of Christopher Columbus. We now know that at least one other old world civilization, the Vikings reached America before Columbus and possibly others, possibly even other Europeans, but even though Columbus was not first, it was his journey that began the processes that will lead to the linking of the old and new worlds and thereby the United States. So he remains irrelevant. Figure Columbus sailed to the new world, essentially to find a new trade route to India as the traditional route to the east have been cut off by the hostile and Muslim Ottoman Turks.

Speaker 1:          01:51          When they captured Constantinople, he landed in the modern day Caribbean and claim the land for Spain. Those Spain and Portugal will later to spit the land claims and settle it with a treaty of tourists. Hideous Columbus would never realize that the land in which she had landed was not Asia and the fact that he was unaware that he had landed in an entirely new continent is why the native Americans are a times still referred to as Indians. It was only realized shortly after his death by America vis fugi after whom the continent is actually named his Latin name being America's Columbus will be made governor of the area, but as brutal rule over the native peoples would have hoard the Spanish monarchs and caused him to remove him from power. Columbus died in 1504 but its effect on history, the linking of the two worlds for better and for worse with long outlive him.

Speaker 1:          02:37          The Europeans were now very greatly interested in the land resources and all the opportunities that this new world had to offer. Spain and Portugal, what continue to lead the charge into the Americas for at least the next century and extend the grip across much of north central and South America. Immediately after Spain's discovery, the other late 15th century major powers of Europe, Portugal, France, and England realized they needed to jump into the theater right away, a wave of explorers be sent to the new world and coming decades. The King of England, Henry that's seventh, was introduced the concept of finding a northern route to China by an Italian by the name of Giovanni Kuboto. Just a few years after Columbus is landing, Giovanni now living in England would change his name to John Cabot. Henry would then decide to sponsor his voyage and in 1497 cabinets depart westward. Eventually he would land and what he assumed was likely China, but was in fact probably either Newfoundland or Nova Scotia.

Speaker 1:          03:33          Kevin did not stay long on his voyage and though he found evidence of human activity in the area did not make contact with any of the native Americans. After his voyages. Records of Cabot's existence become less clear, though it's likely that he died shortly after and unfitting end. For someone who had now set the stage for English involvement in North America over the next century. Multiple nations would attempt colonies in the modern day United States, most of which would fail. The Americas were land of great opportunity to the Europeans for the cost of that opportunity was contending with disease, starvation, harsh weather, isolation from the Homeworld and hostile native Americans who had inhabited lands from Millennia as France began its colonization and exploration of America, which would later lead to the places not on as Quebec Acadia and Louisiana. England would make its first effort at a colony and modern day. North Carolina on an island known as Roanoke island named after the local native peoples.

Speaker 1:          04:28          On March 25th, 1584 Queen Elizabeth the first gave Sir Walter really the right to organize a colony in North America, which would serve to establish England's presence on the continent, generate commerce, and to construct a military base against their main enemies. The Spanish one would be established on Roanoke. The colonist here will be the first Englishman to cultivate and bring back to England. Things like corn, potatoes, and tobacco. The first English child born in America, Virginia dare was born in this. Connie, on August 18th the granddaughter and the colonies leader, John White, 118 people lived in this colony. John White Left, returned to England, but when he came back to the colony after having been delayed for a few years, there was no trace of them. The colonists and most of the colony had vanished. White found no evidence of a struggle or a battle and much the settlement had been dismantled and what looks like a calmly and organized manner.

Speaker 1:          05:19          All that why could find was the word Krakatoan carved on a tree. White was unable to search nearby islands because of weather. And to this day, no one knows exactly what happened. The first English colonization of the new world was not only a failure, it was a mystery. The English had failed and their first attempt and other attempts, but would naturally try again. 17 years later on May 14th, 1607 the colony of Jamestown was founded in Atlanta, come to call Virginia after the Virgin Queen Elizabeth, the settlers, a mix of laborers and gentlemen from England. Expect the primary function of this call need to be the extraction of gold and silver. However, as was often a case for Europeans coming to the new world with this death, his time with his intention, they quickly discovered that there was little here. Within weeks of landing, the men started being attacked by the native pow hot and tribe the English.

Speaker 1:          06:11          However, we're prepared to respond to this threat. They came well armed and constructive professional fortifications within 20 days. Perhaps they had secured themselves militarily, but the settlers soon began to realize that they would not be without other hardships. The settlers unfortunately arrived at Jamestown during one of the greatest droughts within a thousand year record. Furthermore, not only had they arrive too late in the season to effectively grow food, but many of the columnists were not skilled farmers are foreigners. Many were expecting of trade for food with the local natives for the drought was affecting them as well. The settler is found themselves too busy trying to survive the harvest nearby resources or look for golden silver. On top of this disease was rampant and perhaps we kill more in Jamestown and starvation or the continuous native American attacks. The majority of colonists who lived here with die of these hardships.

Speaker 1:          06:59          Within the first five or so years, that population would go from 500 to 60 John Smith, the colonies leader was the man holding this call need together. It was he who insisted a new shipment of supplies we sent from England and he then install the very simple and straight forward rule for the colonists quoting the Bible. He said he who will not work, will not eat, directed mostly towards to settlements upperclass and it was John Smith primarily who held the most successful negotiations with the native Americans. He also named the region of New England, a name which lasts to this day. John Smith's contribution to Jamestown was invaluable, but he was returned to England after being injured in an accidental gunpowder explosion in 1609 the colonists entered into what is known as the starving time and are forced to eat rats, horses, dogs, snakes, and eventually whatever they could find. In some instances they would turn to cannibalism.

Speaker 1:          07:51          The natives kept attacking disease was unchecked and paranoia was rampant. Suspicions of Catholic or Spanish plots ran high and indeed there is no scientific evidence of arsenic poisoning taking place here. The colony was nearly abandoned until the arrival of Thomas West third bear and dilawar better known as Lord Delaware. Delaware was the most effective leaders since John Smith and helped her in the colony around. Furthermore, along with Lord Delaware, a man by the name of John Ralf carried with him something which would also help shape the future fortunes of Jamestown, a new strain of tobacco. He intended to start growing. The tobacco was very popular in England and it would not only make Ralf a wealthy man, but save Jamestown Roth having become an important figure in the Connie. What Mary? The chief's daughter, Pocahontas, which would secure piece between the [inaudible] and the English. For a few years long enough to get James Town on his feet.

Speaker 1:          08:43          The colony would now begin to grow into the thousands, many who came over for the next few decades where what are known as indentured servants. These laborers sign contracts promising to work in the area in exchange for residents and voyage there. After a specific amount of time when they had paid off their debts, they were free to go off on their own. James also eventually saw the first African slaves and American 16 1920 slaves intended for the Spanish colonies were brought to Jamestown, though some were eventually granted a degree of freedom. Many other important historical events would take place at Jamestown as well. The first body of elected representatives known as the house of burgesses would assemble. It was intended to represent the voices of the inhabitants of Jamestown to make it more agreeable. Though only English men were allowed to vote. The Polish Slovakian and German sellers, we're not outraged.

Speaker 1:          09:32          They formed the first protest and refuse to work until they were granted a right to vote as well. Within a month, it had worked. Conflict with the native Americans would eventually resume and would last for decades within time. However, the English would weaken and eventually destroy the power. Hot and confederacy. Meanwhile to the north England was expanding its presence in the new world. Further and 1620 a group of pure attend religious separatists from the Anglican church known as the pilgrims would travel to America originally relocating to the Netherlands after having been unwelcome and England, feeling that the Anglican church resembled a Catholic church far too much, they decided instead to found a settlement in a new world. The settlements they let her felt could grow to become a city on a hill serving as an example of morality and piety to Europe, the pilgrims led by William Bradford boarded a ship known as the May flower along with a number of other English merchants and craftsmen and set sail for the new world.

Speaker 1:          10:28          Eventually finding a settlement and a Cape Cod area. In Modern Day Massachusetts. Before landing, the colonist drew up what they would call the Mayflower compact. This established a set of laws which the colony would follow and sell disagreements between the Puritan and non puritan settlers and the first winter about half of the original settlers of a dye. Toward the end of the winter, formal relations with the local native Americans began. There was some disagreement among the two sides at first. However, the relationship between the English and the native Americans here with turnout to go very well. At first, the Wampanoag people would even help the English survive, teaching them new farming techniques and familiarizing them with the land. After a year of hard work in general success, the natives and pilgrims celebrated the autumnal harvest together, while not necessarily celebrating the success of everything going on. In general, this feast would later become the Thanksgiving holiday and the 1630 is more of the foundations for what would become England's 13 colonies began to take root. This growth would not be unimpeded. However, along with the native Americans who were beginning to react to increased pressure on them in a lens. England was also competing in the theater. It was Spain, the Dutch, Sweden for a little while and France and July of 1636 the first major war in the region with breakout, the p Quad war. It arose as a mixture of English expansion into the region and the attempts of the p tribe to dominate trade in the region. The war would primarily consists of the

Speaker 2:          11:54          two sides conducting raids against each other and having skirmishes with the wars, climax being what is referred to as the mystic massacre, wherein the English and their native allies assaulted a p Quad village burned it and killed it, likely over 500 people. By the 1640s tens of thousands of English settlers were living in the colonies and the 16 fifty's a series of conflicts would be game with a Dutch sparked by conflict in Europe. During the Anglo Dutch wars, the English would conquer Dutch territory in North America, including most notably the city of new Amsterdam, which the English would rename to New York. In 1670 Charles 10 was founded paving the way for the Carolina colonies. Carolina being Latin for Charles, named after Charles. The second though the colonies were, as I said in an in this time numbering and the tens of thousands of people, there was still a great demand for labor, increasing the number of indentured servants and African slaves into the colonies.

Speaker 2:          12:45          In 1675 a major conflicts between the English and the native American tribes known as King. Phillip's war would break out from the strains of English expansion. King Phillip refers somewhat humorous leads. The leader of the Wampanoag tribe made a comment. Thousands died in this war and significant parts of New England where pillaged and burned by the natives, but the English would of course, eventually when this war in 1678 with the death of medic comment following this war, England has secured his position on the coastal regions. Also in 1678 another major incident occurred in colonial history, Bacon's rebellion. As land became scarcer, the English and Virginia felt need to push westward into native American territory. Virginia Governor William Berkeley. However, it was trying to avoid conflict with the native Americans for multiple reasons. War was very strenuous and trade was often very profitable. With Len becoming scarcer, indentured servants receive less than ideal land surrounded by hostile natives and felt powerless to respond and response.

Speaker 2:          13:45          A group of both white and black men led by Nathaniel Bacon began writing native American villages, which occupied land that they wanted to expand into. On September 16th much of Jamestown will be burned by the rebels, had Nathaniel bacon not died of dysentery. A month later, the rebellion may have continued further. Bacon's rebellion failed and the colonial government was forced to respond and indentured servitude having become more costly and unstable to the wealthy elite, the funded it was gradually stopped. As a result, the labor shortage and the sprawling agricultural society that the south would lead to a grid of the man for African slaves and 1680 the French claim to territory surrounding the Mississippi. They called a great stretch of land at Louisiana. After Louie the 14th as England's colonies continued to expand, Francis did as well. The European borders of the new world began to touch both England and France and claim land to Canada and had specific interest it controlling the waterways of North America such as the Great Lakes and the Ohio River.

Speaker 2:          14:41          On March 4th, 1681 William Penn was granted or well charted. It found land known as Pennsylvania, Latin for pens, forest. This territory would increase Anglo French tensions in the region. This tension would lead to conflict between the two nations. In fact, four major wars often involving native Americans in coinciding with conflict in Europe and 1688 King William's war, the first war was fought, though the borders would remain essentially similar. Five years later, Queen Anne's war would break out between England or as it was now, Britain against France and Spain. The war would last for 11 years in cell 1713 with Breton as a clear victor getting more territory and 1740 king George's war broke out. This war saw slight French military victory. Though little territorial changes were really made. The colonies, particularly New England, however, would suffer great losses. The lack of resolution is toward any of the major problems here with lead to the final fourth major showed between the colonies of Britain and France in North America in 1754 referred to in the United States as the French and Indian war.

Speaker 2:          15:45          The war would settle the dispute between Britain and France and lay the foundations for the future of the continent, Britain and France, where arguably evenly matched, but for different reasons. The population of the British colonies had grown to about 2 million, but from Louisiana to Canada, there were only about 60,000 French Canadians. The French, however, still had a very strong emphasis on military in the region. Furthermore, the French had done better at maintaining peaceful relations with the native Americans and the British and accordingly, most native tribes involved with Psi with the French, with the exception of tribes such as the Iroquois. The war would break out over territorial disputes around basically the Great Lakes and the Ohio River with particular emphasis on the Ohio country here. When a 21 year old British officer from Virginia named at George Washington engage a company of French forces in a small skirmish called the battle of his Human Ville, Glenn War broke out.

Speaker 2:          16:37          During this war, the colonies would meet as one for the first time. It's something known as the Albany Congress wherein a 48 year old polymath named Benjamin Franklin would suggest a common defense of the colonies. For the first four years of the war. The French were consistently winning against the British and 1758 however, the tide of war changed when General John Forbes, the Forbes expedition with the intended goal of winning three specific victories established by the British Secretary of State, William Pitt, after whom the city of Pittsburgh, his name's he would succeed at to drive in the French from Fort Duquesne in the Ohio Valley and Louie Berg and Nova Scotia. The third invasion would fail with a backup car, y'all in which around 3000 French troops defeated 18,000 British throughout the rest of the war. However, the British would begin to consistently win over the French in 1760 when general James Wolff would die during his victorious assault salt on the French at the battle of the plains of Abraham, the British would occupy Quebec City, which essentially allowed them to capitulate the rest of Canada.

Speaker 2:          17:37          Though the war would continue for three more years into 1763 the main portion of it had ended with the battle of the plains of Abraham. The war ended with the treaty of Paris officially that year and in that the French chose to retain their more profitable Caribbean colonies over disputing their holdings in North America. Britain would claim the rest of Canada and the Ohio region and Francis Louisiana territory would be given to Spain as compensation for the loss of Florida. Britain was now essentially the unchallenged power in North America. Though this position came at a cost, the British had nearly doubled their national debt and had to increase taxes across the empire, including the North American colonies, which would literally the complications in relations with the colonies following the French and Indian war, Pontiac's rebellion would take place. A reaction. Depression now felt by the natives from British expansion.

Speaker 2:          18:27          Thousands of British soldiers and colonist would be killed or displaced by the natives would eventually be defeated. The policy regarding their subjugation was lightened following the rebellion. Soon thereafter, the royal proclamation of 1763 four bay colonists from settling west of the Appalachian Mountains. The fact that colonists were not only forbidden from settling west of the Appalachians, but were in fact sometimes removed by the British military forcibly would agitate the colonists. Further, the royal proclamation of 1763 would be among the first of several incidents over the coming decade that would lead to strain between the British and the 13 colonies colonies, which Heather had enjoyed a high degree of independence tensions, but grow throughout the 1760s as the British did things such as imposed a number of taxes on the call has to satisfy these war debts like the sugar act, the Currency Act, and the stamp act. They also kept the army.

Speaker 2:          19:18          They're following the war, which the colonists felt was unnecessary as not only did they massively outnumber the frontier native Americans, but indeed most male colonist owned guns and we're expected to be in militias. The quartering act was passed, which required American colonists to provide housing for these soldiers. British soldiers could also enter colonial homes to ensure that they were following through with these regulations. The colonists protested these things to a degree at which officials from nine colonies met incentive British government, the declaration of rights in grievances, and I do mean to emphasize the British government here. It's not just King George. The third making the rules, it's parliament as well. The colonist. We're not angered about the taxes themselves, especially considering how much lower they were in the colonies and they were in England. They were more angered by the fact that they had no say in these taxes. They had no representatives in parliament or as it's often called, they were mad about taxation without representation. Parliament actually does end up repeating the stamp act, but it's a little relief to the colonies because they've passed the declaratory act and the town's index. Soon thereafter stating that the British parliament had the same right to rule over the colonies as a did England in placing indirect taxes on things like paper, t and glass and the 17 seven these protests became more intense

Speaker 1:          20:29          thing, such as the Boston massacre occurred, which wasn't really a massacre. It was an exaggeration of an incident in which British soldiers shot into a violent crowd that was deemed self-defense. Three years later in 1773 the Boston tea party occurred and incident in which the sons of liberty disguise themselves as native Americans and toss entire shipment of t overboard in defiance of the British. After this, the British began to crack down even harder and the colonies began to respond with even more defiance and in 1774 at least is something called the first continental congress. Attending this first congress were men such as Patrick Henry, Samuel Adams, and John Adams. Now, this Congress did not assemble a start talking about independence. Very few people in fact even talked about independence. In cell 1776 it assembled to decide what to do about an emerging conflict. Their initial goal was to try to reason with a British garment, but that essentially failed.

Speaker 1:          21:24          This would lead to the second continental congress in which other figures like Thomas Jefferson and George Washington, and to the stage, the plan was still not initially to separate from the British empire, but the tries to demand further that the conditions being met by the British government possibly even to organize a colonies into revolt in a spring of 1775 however, when British soldiers attempted to seize weaponry from American patriots, the men resisted leading to the battles of Lexington and Concord. The first shot was fired at these battles. Often remember it as the shot heard round the world, the British would win the battles, but it would mark the beginning of an entire war. British forces began clashing with American malicious. On June 15th the Continental Congress officially adopted the Continental Army and put George Washington in charge of it. On July 5th the colonist addressed the olive branch petition to King George, the third and an effort to avoid further escalation of war.

Speaker 1:          22:18          But in August when the proclamation for suppressing rebellion and sedition was issued following the battle of Bunker Hill, stating that the colonies were in rebellion and would be subdued by forests, hopes of achieving peace where greatly diminished war would continue and the congress, and in fact the whole nation gradually just began splitting from the British empire more and more until on July 4th, 1776 the continental congress declared to the United States was an independent nation. It was now all or nothing. The British began sending large amounts of their own soldiers as well as hiring mercenaries from Hessia. British forces would capture New York from rebel forces and would cause Washington to retreat with the British closing in. They felt that they could win the war within a year and American morale began to drop. However, on Christmas Day 1776 forces on the general Washington surprise attack that British and Hash and forces at the battle of Trenton and one which encouraged the rebels to keep going the following year, the British would attempt to close in from the north in what's referred to as a Saratoga campaign. Though they were upheld. It was costly in American spirit, drops his Wyatt and make camp for the winter and valley forge. The winter here was very hard on American troops, but an exiled Prussian officer. The Baron von Steuben would be instrumental and shredding American troops and pressure military tactics. Up to this point, much of the success of the American army was in guerrilla warfare, but on the open field, Washington was forced to contend with the fact that he was essentially sending militias up against

Speaker 2:          23:46          it, better trained and better equipped to professional army. Interestingly, for unknown reasons, the British chose not to attack the American army at Valley forge had they done so. It's very possible that the war could have ended following this winter. The rebel side received some aid. France now having confidence in the rebels abilities, openly allies itself with the United States, Spain and the Netherlands would also join the war, distracting Britain on other fronts. Now, allied nations being a part of the American revolution are often only glanced over or sometimes even, I hate to say intentionally left out, but the reality is that without foreign help, especially from the French, the American revolution probably would have failed the American side needed to funding the supplies and the troops, especially on a sees as the British at this time had the most powerful navy on earth. And as we shall see in some instances like the battle of Yorktown, which we'll get to in a second, there are even more French soldiers and there are Americans.

Speaker 2:          24:41          The war continued in 1780 the British found success at Charleston, but where to feed it in the north following the battle of Springfield on September 28th, 1781 the siege of Yorktown begin the seed with us for a month, but on October 19th that combined American and French armies had defeated the British. Though the war would continue officially for two more years until a 1783 this was the last major battle with the piece of Paris. The British would recognize American sovereignty and seed it to the territory east of the Mississippi. The United States was now a fully independent nation with the British ceiling home. The American Victor's now found themselves freed of the old government, but now faced with a new challenge building a new one. It's incorrect to think that the concept of the United States we have to date was already in everyone's mind. The government had to walk on eggshells essentially to avoid further separation and rebellion.

Speaker 2:          25:33          There was a very real threat of something like Virginia or Massachusetts operating as a separate nation and splitting from the union. The period of 1783 to 1789 is often called the confederation period named so because the United States was still operating off the articles of confederation. The articles can federation left the central government, which only consisted of a congress week and without much power to levy taxes, organized trade, enforce laws, raise an army, et cetera. Most of the governing was left to the individual states. Essentially we had the states, but they weren't fully the United States. Many of the founding fathers felt that the only way that the United States can be held together as a large nation was if they adopted a new constitution with a stronger central government with Shay's rebellion against the corrupt Massachusetts government and ineffective American government. The desire grew stronger. Delegates would reconvene in Philadelphia in 1787 with the intent of reshaping the articles of confederation, but would find themselves instead writing a new constitution.

Speaker 2:          26:32          The constitution of the United States after long debate will be past a document basically lays the foundation for the United States. Up Today. It organizes the government into three branches, the legislative and judicial branches. Each branch was designed to check each other to ensure democracy and as his constitution remains one of the shortest and the world attempted to ensure limited governmental power, the voting population would elect to figures to represent them and the government and it would not really always directly vote on issues themselves. The first president of the United States was George Washington, who was unanimously elected along with its vice president John Adams. In 1781 the first 10 amendments were added to the constitution to limit the power of the government further and established a number of rights and freedoms for the populace and ease concerns about a central government that was so powerful. The first protect the rights of Americans to speech, religion and organization and protest the second their right to bear arms to guard against governmental corruption.

Speaker 2:          27:30          The third preventing the quartering of soldiers and American homes, et Cetera. This constitution was not about the government granting people rights. It's about the people renting the government to write their will with a large number of restrictions on what it could do. The United States was not the first democracy in the world. It was not even the only democracy at the time. The British even who are sometimes portrayed as tyrannical absolute monarchist were relative to the rest of Europe. A fairly democratic nation. Much of the American revolution was about not having the same rights, not that these rights were entirely in existence. There are a number of reasons that the British didn't just grant the American colonists equal representation in parliament, but they mainly boiled down to the fact that not even most of Britain was equally represented in parliament. Giving Americans equal representation would have caused a bigger situation than it sounds like.

Speaker 2:          28:19          Keep in mind, for the more at the start of the country, only about 6% of the population could vote. This was the population of white landowning males. It was not unheard of prior to this for the wives of landowning males and for free black men to vote in some situations, but these reits were eventually revoked as time went on, which will be important to understand. As centuries progress and the 1790 [inaudible] we see the United States began to take a more familiar shape. The population was about 4 million people just over one 100th of what it is today. You had to, this population was on the move. A major concern was the acquired land to the West. The northwest ordinance of 1787 did more than just establish the first territory of the United States. It laid the foundation for how westward expansion and the eventual admission of new states could take place.

Speaker 2:          29:05          These new territories would eventually be divided into new states of Ohio, Michigan, Illinois, Indiana, and Wisconsin. We also see the rise of political parties in the United States. During this time. The federalists and the Democratic Republicans with the first a prominent figurehead of the federalist was Alexander Hamilton, the secretary of the Treasury, who was instrumental in creating the national bank and structuring American trade. Thomas Jefferson typically aligned with the Democratic Republicans who favored a comparatively more domestically focused and democratic United States. When the French Revolution broke out and became more intense, the two political parties found themselves taking unofficial sides. The federalist who found Brent to be their most valuable trading partner supported British efforts against France. A Democratic Republicans were sympathetic towards similar goals of the French revolutionaries against their king and for democracy supported their revolutionary aims. President Washington was very much bothered by all of this. He was very much against the concepts of both political parties at home and the lions has abroad.

Speaker 2:          30:05          The French called upon the Americans to honor their alliance, but Washington maintains neutrality when the Jay Treaty was signed in 1795 which established Britain as America's closest trading partner. The US had mildly chosen this side, though this treaty was very unpopular and the US, as we shall see, isn't that remain on the side mainly because of British continue to do things like arming hostile native Americans and capturing American sailors unfortunate in to serve and the British navy. It was commonly felt by the government that the Jay Treaty can be forged and the one sign in the past with the French was void because it was signed with the King of France, not the French republic. Therefore, the United States was not obligated to assist a French militarily. In 1797 George Washington retired from his office and the precedent for the presidents to serve only two terms. This would later become law. John Adams would succeed him in the following election with Thomas Jefferson serving as vice president Adams, a federalist took stronger federalist positions and George Washington, but still wanted the United States to remain for the most part.

Speaker 2:          31:06          Neutral. This soon kind of falls apart as failed negotiations lead to the quasi war with France and unofficial naval conflict between the two. Adams would also pass the alien and sedition acts, which made it more difficult for immigrants to come into the country and allow the government to imprison and deport anyone who is deemed dangerous. Though this included even people who criticize Adam's presidency, the acts were quickly repealed, but it just goes to show that some concepts like free speech weren't firmly indisputably entrenched in American politics. The concept of America, yet the quasi war would end when Napoleon who was more reasonable than the French revolutionary government came to power and negotiate peace with the American diplomats. There was popular support for war, but both the US and the points, French empire had many other things to worry about. In 1801 Thomas Jefferson was elected president and he begins to start changing a few things around.

Speaker 2:          32:00          Jefferson did not like the federal government. You're not like banks. He was a farmer from Virginia and he was much more sympathetic to the aims of the majority of the American population were farmers and the federalists were during his presidency. The northwest of the nation began to take shape when Ohio becomes a 17 state in 1803 much more significantly. Napoleon had recently required the Louisiana from Spain. However, when the French lost Haiti, Napoleon essentially felt that the rest of America was useless territory and he sold at the Jefferson for a very cheap price. Essentially purchasing what would become several future states from France for what would today be $300 million or about $23 million estate state. Again, by today's standards, President Jefferson later sends out an expedition led by men named Merryweather Lewis and William Clark to explore the American West and establish relations with major native American tribes.

Speaker 2:          32:52          They would succeed in doing much of this with the help up has shown a woman's secretary [inaudible] though they did not of course find the northwest passage, which there were also asked to look for this and Jefferson speculation that mastodons could still live in the American west. Just goes to show how little Americans knew of what was in the West. When James Madison became president in 1809 many of the problems and of strains with Britain still existed. The British was still capturing American sailors harassing American ships and arming native Americans in northwest territory. Namely a confederation led with Shawnee chief to comes up in 1812 and retaliation to these offenses. The United States with declare war on Britain. The British were far too occupied by the Napoleonic wars too. At first launch response, though they were able to, along with our native allies, hold off American expansion into Canada.

Speaker 2:          33:41          The British would also attempt to blockade American trade and free and recruit many American slaves into their armies. The American army at this time was not an efficient fighting force. The concept of a large standing army was considered dangerous. Too many Americans at the time, including Congress. Instead, much of the American military relied lied on militias that would be called up whenever war was a threat. When Napoleon was defeated in April of 1814 the British were able to focus more on the war with America. American forces were overwhelmed. They were defeated at the battle of Bladensburg and the British thing captured Washington DC burning down the White House and attempting to burn down much of the city though a heavy storm put out these fires. A month later during the battle of Baltimore, Francis Scott Key would write his famous poem, the Star spangled banner, which would later become America's national anthem in December of 1814 it was beginning to look as though the war would end in a draw.

Speaker 2:          34:33          The two sides met in Ghent, Belgium to form a peace treaty. Accordingly, fighting would continue even after the peace treaty was signed as word of it had not yet reached America, such as the infamous battle of New Orleans where Andrew Jackson defeated a fourth in British over three times as large as the zone. The war was indeed a truce. Though the United States arguably suffered more in the British following the war of 1812 a sense of national pride swept through the United States road and can now building to facilitate trade throughout the nation and expansion into other parts of it picked up with particular emphasis on things like the ability of the newly invented steamboat soon and the later 1820s at the introduction of the railroad will begin to reshape transportation across a very large areas of the United States. Factories would spring up across the country, primarily in the north with the south still focusing more so on agriculture. Though this advancement in technology and production did absolutely make this south of Richard and more productive as well. These factories were worth by women and the hundreds of thousands of immigrants pouring into the nation, redefining the American workday and work for

Speaker 1:          35:37          us. All of these innovations as well as others are part of what is called the market revolution, which was a result of the industrial revolution and when pave the way for America to grow into a much larger power. As time went on, hundreds of thousands of settlers were pouring into the western lands over the decades, which would eventually lead to the concept of manifest destiny that God had given the America the right to spread out across a continent. In 1823 we see something called the Monroe doctrine named after President John Monroe, essentially stating that the United States would not only prohibit future European colonization and lands that they had claimed, but in fact the whole hemisphere will be safe guarded by the United States. The U s was not actually militarily powerful enough to defend the entire Americas from multiple European powers. However, the British join with them on this doctrine. This would mark the beginning of America coming out of isolation and perhaps sowed the seeds for the later beginning of American imperialism powered by, as we discussed, the industrial revolution, which was having grit effects this new open country.

Speaker 1:          36:42          In 1828 Andrew Jackson was elected president. Having had an essentially lifelong military history and having come from a poorer family, he was seen as relatable to the common man. Accordingly, much of what he did was on behalf of the common person, such as opposed in a national banks, which you felt benefited. The upperclass is primarily and extending voting rights to May landless whites. Jackson, who had been a southerner very active in conflict with the native Americans, also signed the Indian removal act, which intended to move the Cherokee Choctaw, Muskogee, Chickasaw, and Seminole peoples and the southern states to new territory. Many Americans protested the Indian removal act as inhumane as it had been, an intention for many dating back as early as it founding fathers, in fact, to attempt to integrate native Americans in twice society, but the government went forward with it leading to what is remembered as the trail of tears, the path these natives falled on a forest relocation to modern day Oklahoma on which a quarter of them or about 10,000 innocent people would perish.

Speaker 1:          37:41          The Seminole tribe in Florida specifically, however, would resist and would lead to the second seminar war and eventually the third, the 1830s we're a very busy time in America for other reasons as well, along with political and industrial movements. Social movements like the second great awakening, a Protestant bliss movement swept through the nation as well as a large number of moments calling for the abolition of slavery and the roots of the feminist movement. Public schools would pop up in the north. However, in the south, people were skeptical of government education or it's with the native Americans continued in 1835 Texas Rosa from Mexico directed by American settlers and declared itself an independent nation. Only a decade later, the United States would admit Texas into union. The United States didn't laid their eyes on California, but the Mexican empire still claims both Texas and California and the American invasion is the region would lead to the Mexican American war.

Speaker 1:          38:33          The war ended within two years when American forces captured Mexico City and incorporated territory, which now makes up much of the southwest. Soon thereafter, the California gold rush would commence by securing this territory. American territory now stretched from the Atlantic to the Pacific in between the border is agreed to with Mexico and British Canada. The goal is a manifest destiny. It seemed were coming to fruition. However, an issue concerning these territories was whether or not slavery will be legal in them, and this was a matter of fierce debate. Originally align placed here divided territories that were to be established as slave holding a free states. Typically as one state on one side of the line was admitted to the union, people on the other side would scramble to make a territory you state to keep it balanced within congress. At a time when new states were frequently being admitted into the union, it was suggested that these new states decide for themselves whether or not they will be slave holding.

Speaker 1:          39:26          This leads to conflict, even actual fighting within these new states, Kansas specifically in the 1850s this conflict came at a time when, as I said, tension over slavery was growing. Books like uncle Tom's cabin began bringing life of slavery to light and John Brown slave rebellion, which failed, sparked fears over further slave uprisings. In 1804 the Haitians had rebelled against their slave masters and tortured, killed and expelled all whites from the island, even friendly ones solidifying southern opinion of abolition and the dangers they felt that posed. Yet in a north, it was commonly felt that a nation which held slaves could not be considered a truly free nation. One such northerner was a man named Abraham Lincoln. His election to the presidency in 1860 was only 40% of the popular vote leads the final fight over slavery, the civil war. Now before we begin here, there is a lot of the bait as to whether or not the civil war was fought over slavery or state's rights and people to this day are still quite attached to the issue.

Speaker 1:          40:27          We can see definitely several examples of strain between the north and south overstates rise throughout history, which were not was slavery. The south was and is indeed different from the north and a number of ways and indeed the common person on both sides was not really concerned about slavery, but one of the civil war was quite complicated. The bottom line is without slavery, the civil war may very well not have ever happened. Out of the interest of preserving the union, Lincoln stated he would not touch slavery in a places in what had already existed. Though his intention, the halt, its expansion into new territories of the nation. We're the final straw for the south or presenting a threat to slavery as a whole. Before Lincoln even took office, South Carolina, Florida, Mississippi, Georgia, Alabama, Louisiana, and Texas seceded from the Union and form the confederate states of America, Georgia and South Carolina had hinted over the possibility of succeeding from the union since the revolution now the union was falling apart.

Speaker 1:          41:24          Conflict did not begin immediately, but when the south on a president, Jefferson Davis began demanding federal property in a territory, though offering to pay for it. The North refused. Accordingly, the south attack, the north held fort Sumpter in South Carolina. On April 12th, 1860 war, Virginia, Arkansas, North Carolina and Tennessee would subsequently joined the south as well. The civil war had begun. Both sides expected a very short war, though they each expected to win the war very quickly. The North was much more industrial, much more populated, had twice the railroads and was better prepared for war in the south was the south harbor. Merely had the fight, a defensive war, and we're out northern efforts to recline a territory. They furthermore felt that their agricultural wealth would cause foreign nations like Britain and France to support them. Of course, the support that not come. The first major battle of the war was the first battle of bull run, also known as the battle of Manassas, the confederate victory.

Speaker 1:          42:20          Here we'll begin to foreshadow that the war will be longer than anticipated. The union's strategy began with a failed attempt to capture the confederate capital of Richmond, Virginia, and later evolve the cutoff to south from outside trade, which meant blockading made your tray ports it controlling the Mississippi. The war would soon be divided into Western and eastern fronts. In 1862 former US general Robert E. Lee with affects the confederate side with a number of confederate successes, especially in the east. The prospect of a confederate victory was becoming more and more realistic for the first few years of the war in 1863 however, things began to change, though having enjoyed a decent amount of victory leaves aggressive strategies would backfire at the battle of Gettysburg. In July of 1863, uh, union victory, which is Optima guarded as a turning point of the war. The following day on July 4th, Ulysses s grant captured Vicksburg subsequently allowing the Union to control the Mississippi and splitting the confederacy into grant was soon made general of all the union forces.

Speaker 1:          43:19          Confederate goal is to win the war by and been in north were lost and now how to fight defensively. Earlier that year, Lincoln had issued the emancipation proclamation and executive order, which intended to free African slaves, still enslaved in rebel. Territory's though not those in union territory with the confederates on the defensive to the union's strategy now was to exhaust confederate supplies and pin them to hasten the end of the war. A prime example of this was William Tecumseh Sherman's march to the sea, which destroyed one fifth of all farms in Georgia. The confederates held out for as long as possible, but on April 9th, 1865 general Robert E. Lee surrender to general grant at the Aba Maddix courthouse in Virginia, the rest of the confederacy would soon follow the civil war with railroads. Telegraphs are in cloud warships and other technologies is considered one of the first industrial wars. Foreshadowing the destructiveness that come in future wars following the war, the south was left impoverished by prolonged conflict.

Speaker 1:          44:15          It was not fully able to sustain the civil war. It remains the deadliest war ever fought by Americans and American history with around 700,000 deaths, a heavy price to pay, but following the war, many things changed. The 13th 14th and 15th amendments passed, which abolished slavery sell the issues of African American citizenship and extended the right to vote to blacks. But this was very much contested, especially in the south. As we will see this. Furthermore, secure the power of the federal government over the states and led to a stronger sense of unity in the country. Prior to this, people are more associated with their individual state, the nation as a whole. People even refer to the United States as a plural eg. The United States are moving their army, not moving. It's army that changed following the civil war. President Lincoln would not live to see these changes, however, or the official end of the war as he was assassinated in Ford's theatre on April 14th, 1865 he was of course in favor of these things and though while he is sometimes seen as the great a massive pater, he and many in the north felt that slavery was wrong but did not exactly see blacks as equals.

Speaker 1:          45:25          Many Americans were not opposed returning the former slaves, the nation of origin, rather than deal with what they felt would be trouble from integrating blacks into white society. Specifically the country of Liberia, America's only colony in Africa established in 1820s as a home for freed African slaves. But for now at this time, independent nation. However, the most would of course remain in the United States.
