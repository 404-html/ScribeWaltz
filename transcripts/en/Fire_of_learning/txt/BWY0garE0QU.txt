Speaker 1:          00:19          I do not know what I appears from the world, but to my so it seemed, I've only been like a boy playing on the seashore indef, rooting myself and now and then finding a smoother pebble or pretty show than ordinary. While the great ocean of truth lay all undiscovered before me,

Speaker 1:          00:38          Sir Isaac Newton was born on Christmas Day 1642 it will store Lincolnshire England. He is regarded by many to have been the greatest scientist who ever lived due to his contributions to physics, mathematics, optics, astronomy, and many more fields. His book philosophy and not Rally Spring Cubia Mathematica and mathematical principles of natural philosophy is regarded with equal esteem. Newton also spent much of his time with religion coming the Bible for hidden meaning and with alchemy attempting to find the philosopher's stone. Newton was born at three months after his father had died, was named after him. He was born prematurely. Ms Not expect to live but live. He did as the age of three newtons. Mother left him to live with his grandmother and she went to live with Newton's new stepfather, angered Newton greatly. Newton's early education began. At the king school in Grantham until those mother widowed again. I'd returned. She brought him home the farm, but Newton would return to school becoming a top of his class and becoming well known for his accomplishments and his inventions and 1661 he was admitted to the Trinity College at Cambridge. It was here where he was educated in many sciences and many mats and here where Newton invented calculus and 1665

Speaker 2:          01:52          okay.

Speaker 1:          01:53          It was also here that the famous falling apple incident occurred leading Newton to his discovery of gravity. There was no books revealed. He was already thinking of the subject. Newton left Cambridge and 1665 is a great plague of London, which killed 25% of the population broke out return in 1667 it wasn't 1667 also that Newton became a fellow of trinity. Though this position required new and to become an ordained Anglican priest privately, Newton had ideas that religion which would have likely caused him trouble if publicized. He did not believe in the trinity and often scour the Bible looking for hidden meeting as aforementioned. Apparently Newton deciphered that the world would end in the year 2060 but there was no evidence to support this claim for these reasons which Newton never revealed. He avoided the position with special permission of Charles a second. Newton's work with optics was also profound.

Speaker 1:          02:44          He worked with prisms and explore light and color. Discovering that white light be split into many other colors. He also invented the first reflecting telescope. I replacing a lens with a mirror. Many of his optical discoveries were putting his book optics. Newton let a private life. You're not going along with a few other scientists of his day and could not stand criticism. He was so struck by it that he was reluctant to ever publish anything much of its work also would have been dangerous to him. It publicized there's religious explorations as well as exploration of alchemy. Newton searched heavily for the philosopher's stone and spent much of his time on alchemy that regarded as a pseudoscience. Today. Newton's undertaking of alchemy seems to resemble more so an early form of chemistry. In 1669 Newton you came to the carry and professor of mathematics a position more recently held by Stephen Hawking.

Speaker 1:          03:36          Years later in 1679 Newton regain an interest in astronomical matters while corresponding with scientists such as Robert Hook, John Flam steed and Edmund Holly. Holly would later help. Newton published his Principia Mathematica. This book stated Newton's laws of motion and gave birth to classical mechanics. It was published your life. Fifth, 1687 years earlier in 1676 Newton wrote the hook if I have seen farther, it is by standing on the shoulders of giants and 1689 and in 1701 Newton became a member of parliament is recorded that he only spoke once to, I said a window be closed. In 1696 he became warden of the Royal Mint where he heavily cracked down on counterfeiters. Newton held this position for the last 30 years of his life prosecuting 28 corners and 1703 Newton became president of the royal society and 1705 Newton was knighted by queen and hence the name Sir Isaac Newton. Well, this was likely more due to political occurrences and scientific achievements towards the end of his life. Newton lived in cranberry park with his niece and her husband until he died in his sleep on March 20th, 1727 he was buried in Westminster Abbey. He died of natural causes, though examinations of his body after his death revealed traces of mercury in his hair, mercury poisoning. He may have been a part of Newton's strange behavior and mental breakdowns in his later life. The life of Isaac Newton was extremely profound and the words of Alexander Pope, I remember it as a suitable description of Newton nature and nature's laws. Late, hidden night, God said, let there be Newton and all was light.
