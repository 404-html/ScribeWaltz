Speaker 1:          00:00          In the last video we covered the history of Germany from its earliest beginnings up through the late Middle Ages. Is that video got a magnificent response. Thank you. While greatly for that and this video, we are going to conclude that history as we pick up where we left off and continue to modern day Germany budget. Before we begin, I'd like to thank Laura and Ashley A, B, c, d, e, f, g, and Gabby are for being our most recent patrion supporters. And now without further ado, last owns sliding start.

Speaker 1:          00:47          We left off around the year 1437 what's the death of Emperor Sigismund who was succeeded by Albert the second and then Friedrich the third, both of the house of Habsburg. The Teutonic order had been successfully challenged by Poland and Lithuania at the battle of groove vault a few decades earlier, and the situation in the Baltic region was now more precarious. The Muslim Ottoman Turks were advancing closer to imperial territory in 1453 they would take the city of Constantinople destroying the Byzantine Empire, which sparked fear throughout the German lands. The Hoh Hanzo learns had become the margarines of Brandenburg centering their power in an emerging city, Berlin, despite political divisions as a time, Germany was an economic powerhouse. It is also some time in the 15th century that the country takes on the new name of the holy Roman empire of the German nation. The 15th and 16th century in Germany was a period of earth shaking change as it was now entering the renaissance, a period of technological, philosophical and religious changes and advances, which marks the end of the medieval era.

Speaker 1:          01:52          One such innovation which took place in the city of mines in 14 and 39 was the invention of the printing press by Yohanis Gutenberg, which changed forever, how the written word and therefore ideas and knowledge was spread across Europe. In 1493 maximum million. The first became emperor with personal domains growing. Many of the emperors of the age preferred to live outside the political mess that was the center of the Holy Roman Empire at the time, living and dying and Austria, Bohemia and Hungary. The lack of the presence of the emperor. Only worse than the divides in Germany. At the time, leaving the nobility within the country without a center around which to meet often resulting in fuse and armed conflicts between them with no clear arbitrators along with politics, other areas of life such as religion. We're becoming areas of contention as well. Soon perhaps Christianity's biggest divide would begin in Germany, sparked by a monk named Martin Luther Martine Aloo tear was born November 10th, 1483 in central Germany, originally pressured by his father to become a lawyer in 1505 while causing a fierce storm.

Speaker 1:          03:03          Luther is said to have promised God at that he would become a monk if he were spared. The exact events are not known, but Luther kept true to his promise. Luther was an especially pious and devoted monk fulfilling his duties vigorously. However, he was not merely a simple, dutiful monk. He viewed things in the big picture and searched deeply for meaning within religion and is spiritually challenging time. As time went on, he began to question certain practices of the Catholic Church, partly inspired by past reformers such as yon whois. One issue of which Luther was skeptical was the Catholic churches selling of indulgences. Purchasing an indulgence was simply a way for an individual to reduce their or someone else's time and purgatory. Luther saw this as a corrupt scheme and noticed that that key figures involved had financial burdens. Pope Leo the 10th for example, sought funding to rebuild St Peter's basilica in Rome.

Speaker 1:          04:01          Luther began to question the selling of indulgences and as time went on, even dare to directly challenged the church on the issue using it as an entrance to challenge it on other issues as well. The tail of Luther's next move is one of history's most famous moments. On October 31st, 1517 Luther nailed his disputation on the power of indulgences, better known as his 95 theses to the door of the church in Wittenberg where he challenged the power of the Catholic Church and boldly began what is remembered as the Protestant reformation history has perhaps somewhat romanticize this scene. It is uncertain whether Luther actually nailed the 95 theses to the church door. Furthermore, it would be somewhat incorrect at this point of view. Luther as a renegade. His intention was not yet to leave the Catholic church only to reform it. The 95 theses were meant to be starting points for debate, not necessarily a list of demands.

Speaker 1:          05:02          They were written in Latin and only translated into German by other people later on implying Luther had no desire yet for popular revolution. Luther would also question more deeply held aspects of Catholicism as well. Eventually becoming more radical and questioning the necessity of the Catholic church itself. Much of his life was then spent in bitter dispute with the church. By 1521 he was summoned to the Diet of worms by now Maximillian. The first had been succeeded by his grandson, crawled at fifth who was also King of Spain and Ruler of Lens and Burgundy and Italy and via Spain, the Americas. He would be the first European ruler to claim to have an empire upon which the sun never set. Though he did not yet speak German. He resided over the Diet where Luther was expected to recant. Luther did not recant in the face of the most powerful forces.

Speaker 1:          05:57          The day he stood by his works and what he believed to be the truth saying, unless I am convinced by the testimony of descriptors or by clear reason for I do not trust and either the pope or the councils alone, since it is well known that they have often erred and contradicted themselves, I am bound by the scriptures I have quoted at my conscience is captive to the word of God. I can not and will not recant anything since it is neither safe nor right to go against conscience. A month later, Luther was declared a heretic and his arrest was demanded. However, he managed to escape to Saxony, which was under the rule of Prince Elector Friedrich, their visa Fredrick, the wise some among the upper classes also felt that it was well timed to reform the church in some manner. As I have mentioned in many other parts of this documentary, the will of the emperor did not necessarily supersede that of the local German rulers and whether or not Luther's works.

Speaker 1:          06:52          We're effectively Ben and each area depended on how the local rulers felt about them. Carl, the fifth's wars with France and the Ottomans for the more distracted him thus giving Luther necessary time while in hiding, Luther translated the Bible into German upon completion. The recently invented printing press allowed this Bible to be spread across Germany at a pace greater than ever before. The lower classes in Germany found inspiration and Luther many did not fully understand the ecclesiastical arguments, but the peasants did feel as well that their masters had been abusing them. Echoing much of what Luther had stated in his reformation, this transformed into the German peasants' war in 1524 where both peasants and disadvantage and middle classmen and nobles fought against the nobility of the swabbing league. Though massive in number, the poorly equipped and undisciplined peasantry. We're overwhelmed by this swab. Ian Leaks forces more than a hundred thousand of them were killed and it's conflict and they managed to achieve little Luther from whom many of the peasants drew inspiration initially condemned the revolt and even later stated that the peasants should be killed like mad dogs.

Speaker 1:          08:02          In 1529 it was ordered that the Lutherans and others separatist groups and their heresy at the Diet of spare. These separatists prince's protested if this order giving them the name of their branch of Christianity Protestantism, a unifying name for the non Catholic and nonorthodox branches of Christianity. Maybe the label depends on which Christian group you ask, but more on that in a future video does the emphasis on individuals interpreting the Bible for themselves led to many subdivisions of Protestantism across the continent, Lutheranism and a baptism Calvinism and many more as time passed, a divide between Europe would emerge in the 16th century. By this time, the eastern church had already split from the west and to the Greek Orthodox church affecting these areas here. Much of the north including Britain, Scandinavia, and northern Germany would convert to Protestantism with the exception of most of Ireland. Much of the south along with Poland, France and southern Germany would remain Catholic.

Speaker 1:          09:05          Though there are today substantial nonreligious populations in Europe and a quickly growing Islamic population. This generalized religious map of 16th century Europe is very similar to the current one. The division found in Germany is largely ode to the division of the nation itself. In this time with the hopes for resolution between Catholics and Protestants waning the Protestants to be Schmall call Dick League to defend themselves. By the 1514 Kaiser, Karl was able to turn his attention back to the religious situation in Germany. Tension was in now rising many territories in Germany. We're now Protestant and part of the Schmalkaldic league including sex and eat in Brandenburg for unembarrassed conversion included Hohenzollern master of the Teutonic order outbreak breakfast first and 1525 his territory was cut off from Brandenburg and the other holdings aligns geographically and politically anti now styled himself Duke of Prussia ruling the territory referred to as East Prussia.

Speaker 1:          10:04          East Prussia was not a part of the holy Roman Empire at this time. It was more of a fee for Poland as Martin Luther died in 1546 the two sides were preparing for war, which would erupt into these small call Dick wars later in July. These conflicts would eventually come to a close in 1555 with a piece of Alex Berg and an overall Protestant victory. The main takeaway of this piece was an agreement phrased as quiz or Ego Aus Religio Latin for who's realm is religion. The prince was to choose the religion of his territory, either Lutheran or Catholic and his subjects were expected to convert or leave, which they were freely allowed to do without repercussion. This was a major victory for the nobility over the emperor is yet another successful challenge to his authority. It may seem relative to the age fair and agreeable, but Catholics and Protestants would not live happily ever after tension would build into even greater conflicts that would ravage Europe.

Speaker 1:          11:05          Two degrees, never before seen following a troubled and turbulent rural Carla fifth abdicated from power and 1558 dividing his extensive Habsburg domains between multiple EHRs. The Holy Roman Empire going to fare done on to the first fair to non was followed by Rudolph the second and 1576 Rudolph was a strange individual who preferred his private hobbies to the management of his responsibilities. Often remaining neutral and conflict between Protestants and Catholics and many of the affairs of his day in general simply to avoid them. The Bohemian Hussites saw this as an opportunity to demand greater rights and to recognition which Rudolph granted in the letter of Majesty. During this time conflict it seemed very realistic and the German nobility were busy taking sides. Both Protestant Union and Catholic week reformed in 1608 and o nine trouble soon emerged in Bohemia. Once again, the emperor moth lacked a male heir and so rule was likely to fall to his cousin.

Speaker 1:          12:05          Upon his death though the emperor was as you know in elected and not necessarily hereditary position, the Habsburgs would undoubtedly retain control over it, resorting to essentially a bribery to hold onto it for the next few centuries. Matsyasana. His cousin fair to [inaudible] was an ardent Catholic, which concern that the Bohemians fair to non became king of Bohemia in 1617 when fair to non intended to revoke the letter of Majesty has representatives and Prague were seized by Protestants and d fenestrated meaning thrown out the window cause he representatives did actually somehow survive leading to immediate propaganda on both sides. Catholics claiming that they had been saved by angels, Protestants that they had fallen in manure. As revolts began in Bohemia, this would lead to the outbreak slowly of what is remembered as the 30 years' war from 1618 to 1648 involving many of the major powers of Europe though not all at once in one drawn out conflict.

Speaker 1:          13:06          In fact, it can be rather confusing as some has changed sides and the other war was started for religious reasons. The two sides were not split perfectly between Protestants and Catholics. Matiaz died in 1618 ferritin on the second to became emperor. Soon thereafter, soon Bohemia rose up leading to civil war and the first of four phases of the 30 years' war. He promptly named Bohemian Phase in 1620 Protestants and Habsburgs met at the battle of white mountain near Prague itself, resulting in a decisive Catholic victory. This would effectively end if the Bohemian revolt and the Habsburgs began to convert the Bohemians to Catholicism and following this, which is why the hussite religion did not last to to stay. This could have ended here as a local revolt. However, it had brought the concerns of foreign powers on the table. The Holy Roman emperor had been acting especially autocratic this threatened to the Protestants of Germany and to Europe in general.

Speaker 1:          14:05          Furthermore, a more powerful United holy Roman Empire under a leader who could reverse it's complicated structure was a threat to the European balance of power. Denmark, Norway, a Protestant nation under King Christian, a fourth who is also the Duke of Holstine within the holy Roman Empire, intervened in 1525 by invading and assisting Protestant rebels beginning the Danish phase of the war, the Danish were reinforced by English and Scottish trips with French funding. The last part is noticeably ironic as France was a Catholic nation. Then led even by a cardinal funding Protestant rebels allied to their arch enemy England. The essential reason for this was that the war was evolving to be more about politics and religion, friends with simply surrounded by Habsburgs in Germany and Spain. The Danes, however, were repelled back into Denmark by these skill to General Al [inaudible] Valentine Denmark surrendered in 1629 leading to another Catholic victory in 1630 however, Sweden intervened again with French funding under renowned King Gustavus, Adolphus Sweden.

Speaker 1:          15:11          Shared concerns of Protestant doesn't being threatened in their own backyard and of growing Habsburg power. Sweden was initially greatly successful against the empire winning victories such as it brightened Feld, volunteers, dine and Adolphus met at the battle of Ledson in 1632 the Swedes would want again, but Adolphus would die leading a cavalry charge. Volun Stein accused, though never confirmed of treason was assassinated the following year. The Swedish phase of the war ended in 1635 with the piece of Prague, those Sweden and France where it is satisfied. Sweden continue the war against the empire and France joined in to lead the fight personally. The French phase was the longest and most violent phase of the war during the French phase, fared and on the second died, and was succeeded by fair to nominate third and 1637 who viewed the war now as being draining and desired piece France, Fatah, and against the empire and Spain for the next decade with a mix of results in 1648 the war would end with the infamous piece of best Follia and this peace treaty, a number of important agreements were made, which would shape the future of Europe, Switzerland, and the Netherlands, both formally a part of the holy Roman Empire.

Speaker 1:          16:25          They'll practically independence for centuries became fully independent nations. France became the dominant continental power and claim the border region of all sauce. Many of the religious conflicts between Protestants and Catholics were settled and coexistence among the main branches was somewhat accepted in Germany, at least officially. While there was no true victor of the 30 years' war, Germany lost the most. Most of the fighting, as I said, had taken place within the empire. 8 million people, soldiers and civilians alike died and the fighting or an associated feminines and diseases. The great majority were imperial subjects. Germany lost nearly a third of its population, including half of its male population. Hopes of uniting the holy Roman Empire into what it had once been lost. After centuries of decline and the centralization, this war would strike the greatest blow to the holy Roman Empire. It was not destroyed, but the princess had gained significant autonomy and freedom from the central government.

Speaker 1:          17:26          The Habsburgs of Austria would not successfully research power over them, though Austria would remain a power in its own right and had come out of this war still rather powerful. It was this holy Roman Empire, which a century later famous French radical tier would remark was not holy nor Roman, nor an empire. As we've seen throughout his history. At one point or another, it did have a respectable claim to each of these titles. However, now it was religiously divided and certainly not wholly the days of ruling of a Rome where history and that was very much not an empire. More so a loose confederation of hundreds. In fact, thousands technically of microstates with some larger states along with Austria, one state which had fared better than the others. Despite heavy losses and destruction from the war. It was Brandenburg, Prussia, which had come out of the war with territorial gains under Friedrich Ville home. The great elector. As time went on and the holy Roman empire faded into a relevancy, Austria and Prussia would rise to fill the void left in Germany.

Speaker 1:          18:37          Brandenburg Prussia in 1648 was a disconnected nation ruling. Other disconnected lands in a map which is classically holy Roman. The main territory of Brandenburg was a poor and resource lacking land and the military prior to this point had been feeble. Much of this was now changing under Duke Friedrich Wilhelm, the grid elector, who was consolidating power, expanding his army and seeking ways to grow the state's economy. Even establishing a small colony in Africa known as he brung and Burger Gold Coast Prussia was not the only major state consolidating power. However, Bavaria and Saxony, we're also major local players. Austria simultaneously, the most powerful of all begin to center power and its Habsburg territories within and also outside of the holy Roman Empire, these nations at the center of the continent and therefore it's drama. We're not left alone to do this. And peace. A series of conflicts broke out and the half century or so following the 30 years of war and the latter half of the 17th century, much of the attention of all Europe frankly, was on the French King Louis the 14th throughout his reign, the Germans would be involved in the Franco Dutch war, the nine years war, and the war of Spanish Succession.

Speaker 1:          19:49          Austria furthermore was still on the boundary of the Ottoman Empire and this time period, uh, Turks were effectively at their zenith in 1672 the Franco Dutch war began, which soon evolved into a continental conflict. The empire under Leopold, the first and Prussia for pitted up against France and Sweden with Brandenburg, Prussia and Sweden's conflict being referred to separately as these skinny and more Prussia was actually able to repel the Swedish, which earned it a great deal of prestige and recognition. In 1683 the great Turkish war again, and the infamous battle of Vienna soon followed on September 12th of that year when the Turks besieged the city, the capital of Habsburg, Austria, and by extension the imperial capital as well. Allied forces from across the holy Roman Empire as well as Hungarians and importantly Polish came to Vienna is eight the battle ended with a victory for the allies and the largest cavalry charge and history around 20,000 were killed or captured during the battle itself.

Speaker 1:          20:49          The Holy Roman Empire had been spared from Turkish rule and the Austrians would now push into Turkish territory taking back much of Hungary in Prussia in 1688 Friedrich Ville helm was succeeded by his son, Friedrich. The third is Duke and 1701 the war of Spanish succession broke out with friends taking on the Habsburgs and it's English and Dutch allies. Much of the empire sided with the Austrian House Berg's. However, Bavaria seeking the curb, Austrian power temporarily cited with the French pressure, provided the Habsburgs with troops in exchange for a favor rather than being freed or to third Duke of Prussia. He was soon to be styled. Friedrich the first king in the pressure since Prussia, unlike Brandenburg, was never a part of the empire. Leopold did not contest this much, though it did anger Poland as the king of Poland who still control of the much of the general territory of Prussia, still claimed the title King of Prussia, hence the phrase king in Prussia for Friedrich.

Speaker 1:          21:51          Despite the war favoring the grant alliance, the war of Spanish succession ended more or less in a draw in 1714 as England and the other allies backed out when the war over succession to Spain's thrown began. Emperor Leopold intended his son Carl, to be King of Spain. Leopold died in 1705 and his son and heir Yosef died in 1711 thus, the imperial throne went to that Carl becoming Carl to sixth as he would have been both kings of Spain and the empire, a threatening prospect. Louise candidate, his grandson, Phillipe, became king of Spain but had to renounce his claim to the French throne. Meanwhile, and Prussia King Fredrick Ville home, the first had succeeded his father and 1713 Friedrich Ville helm. The first would come to be known as the sole dot and Cuny. The soldier came. He would continue and expand on the work of his predecessor is in growing pressures.

Speaker 1:          22:45          Military, despite its small size, Brandenburg Prussia was slowly becoming one of the most powerful states in Europe because of this emphasis on the military. The Sparta of the North Friedrich Ville home would devote much of his finances and attention to the military, even selling off the colony in Africa to the Dutch and Benning, a number of luxuries and recreational activities. He himself lived a very disciplined and frugal life. Despite the power he would come to wield, the soldier king would not act aggressively, only defensively going to war only if necessary. Fresher was quite simply vulnerable, surrounded by larger powers and his job was to prudently defendant. Unfortunately in his eyes, one of his biggest disappointments and concerns was his own son and heir. Friedrich Friedrich lack the interest in the military and state craft, which is father's so greatly emphasized, being much more interested in the arts and learning. Fridich was accordingly, often humiliated and abused by his father.

Speaker 1:          23:47          At one point in his life and 1730 he and a counterpart Han's Herrmann von Encarta attempted to flee to England butts. They were captured and von Cata was executed for treason with Friedrich and being forced to watch and may of 1740 Friedrich [inaudible] died and his son Frederick the second became king and Prussia. Despite his father's concerns, Friedrich would not end up a failure. Rather his skill as a leader would earn him. The title Friedrich there. Grossa Frederick the great as Friedrichs rain began, another monarchs was ending. Holy Roman Emperor Carl. The six was dying without a male heir and had previously in his reign tried to ensure the rule of his daughter over all the Habsburg domains, left unbroken. His daughter Maria Theresa would become arch duchess of Austria in 1740 but as a male position her husband frons the first would be holy Roman emperor. Nevertheless, Maria Theresa held the true power of the empire, yet it was contested and would lead to war France, Spain, Bavaria, Saxony and other German and a non German powers would oppose the Austrians and they're British, Russian and Dutch and hen Avarian allies, but above all the arch duchess, his arch enemy was to be Friedrich and Prussia and December of 1740 as winter was setting in Friedrich to the Austrian surprise would make the first move by invading Silesia to the south and fixing one of the richest provinces and the Habsburgs, the main and the winning important battles such as Malevich and Hogan freed bear in 1745 and a peace treaty between Austria and Prussia.

Speaker 1:          25:24          This conquest was recognized by the Austrians, a major blow to them. Yet in 1748 when the whole Austrian wharfs et session ended, Maria Theresa emerged with her reign having been secured and recognized at a sys of victory for Prussia, a mix of results for the Kaiser reading. This would not be the end of the rivalry between Austria and Prussia and the rains of both Friedrich and Maria Theresa. We're only just beginning. There was for now a brief period of peace during which freedom is free to explore his other refined interests and speak with guests. One of whom was the French writer, Voltaire from Whom Friedrich was further educated in philosophy, full tear would say of his kingdom that while some states have an army, the Prussian army has a state and with say of his palace that it was Sparta in the morning but Athens in the afternoon. Usually I have to think of these witty statements but Voltaire did it for me so thanks Voltaire in 1754 the seven years war of again, which would last for nine years.

Speaker 1:          26:30          The conflict originally had begun in the Americas where it is better known as the French and Indian war. The much of the rest of Europe would only be involved for seven years. Hence the name confusion. The conflict was very much the world war of its age. Being one of the first major intercontinental conflicts waged from the Americas to India, Prussia and Austria would play major roles in this conflict as they switched allies from the prior war with France and now supporting Austria and Joris is second king of Britain aligning himself with Friedrich, his nephew surrounded and knowing Austria had its ion. So Louisiana Friedrich moved first invading Saxony in 1756 he would then invade Bohemia but was repelled the Austrians and French then moved into slightly Zia, but Friedrich repelled them despite being heavily outnumbered at the battle of Rossbach and the battle of lighten each of them highlighting his genius as a commander, Frederick found only mild relief and these victories he was facing an alliance of Austria, France, Russia and Sweden with only some German states and Britain as its allies.

Speaker 1:          27:34          Pressure had to fight tooth and nail and Friedrichs mental health suffered considerably. Friedrich likely suffered from mental illness throughout much of his life. He wrote occasionally of suicide and carried poison around with them. At one point. He did nearly die in battle, though his life was spared as his snuffbox deflected a bullet as pressure verge towards the feet. In 1762 queen eulas a of Russia died and was succeeded by Peter to third. Peter was German and origin and was somewhat of a fan of Prussia and Friedrich. He soon switched sides and began attacking Austria. Furthermore, France was seeing to feed to Britain across the world and was withdrawing from the Prussian focus. It was the miracle of the House of Brandenburg and led to pressure the four to stalemate with Austria giving up Saxony, but retaining. So Louisiana, the war ended in 1763 pressures and Australia's borders remained essentially similar.

Speaker 1:          28:31          A great victory for Friedrich, though a disappointment for the Kaiser Marine. In 1772 the next move was made this time in Poland. Poland was in a state of decline and Friedrich saw an opportunity to unite is to territories. That year. He arranged with Austria and Russia, the partition of Poland, where pieces of Poland, where each taken by the three powers Friedrich who hated the Polish, justified this as a civilizing mission. Now controlling all of Prussia Frederick styled himself king of Prussia rather than merely in in 1765 Maria Theresa's husband had died and their son Yosef the second to begin joint rule with his mother. She was devastated by her husband's death and remained in mourning for the rest of her life. She died 15 years later in 1780 upon her death, Friedrich more Inter passing and wrote that he was her opponent but to never her enemy and the past.

Speaker 1:          29:27          He did call her the arch whore of Austria, but whatever. We'll go with it. Free to come. Self died in his arm chair on August 17th, 1786 building on the work of his predecessors, he had turned Prussia a military power which could rival any other power on the continent and has set the stage for the future of Germany itself. Though there was still yet change to come. The rivalry between pressure and Austria was certainly not over and the fate of the German people lay in the hands of these two empires. Frederick had never envisioned a United Germany truth be told he was more similar to the other princes of the day. I'll be a much more ambitious and efficient, but the train of events that would create one had been set in motion.

Speaker 1:          30:13          The German language spoken today by a little under a hundred million people is the official language of Germany, Austria and leaf inch dine, one of the official languages of Belgium, Luxembourg and Switzerland and a regional or minority language in other parts of Europe, South America and even Africa. Its roots lie in ancient times and that gradually expanded and diversified over the centuries creating many dialects which was sometimes almost unintelligible and two other Germans sitting alongside other languages in the empire like check Dutch and Italian. This continued until the renaissance era, a time when many nations we're seeking to standardize their languages. Perhaps it doesn't seem like a major issue if a divided empire has divided languages, but many individuals who did business across borders, like merchants and Holy Roman emperors saw a benefit in uniformity. Luther would be key to the German language is standardization with is widespread German Bible. It was not by accident that his Bible appeal to commoners.

Speaker 1:          31:13          Luther went out of his way to use vocabulary and grammar that was regular among common folk and this laid the foundation for the uniform development of the language. However, the other regional dialects did not all disappear. Take these examples of Varian and all the Monish compared to standard modern German, both still spoken and very much alive though to a lesser extent. Some German dialects still around today are very similar to standard German. Others like these to find themselves on the border of a dialect and a separate language, a bit like English and Scots. So maybe even more distinct. You may have noticed that German has what looks like some strange markings or accents more correctly. UHMM louts to explain these just in the K to sound change. So that margin becomes may Chinn, which means girl Sam would, his maiden Boza is Busia many evil tour is actually tour, which has the same root as and means door.

Speaker 1:          32:11          What about the fancy looking B? It's actually not a B. It's called an s set and represents under a number of circumstances to ss like in the word poison, meaning Prussia. I actually took German in high school and then did some self study later. My German is nowhere near as good as my French, but I'd say I'm at least familiar with the basics. Anyway, I'd like to think my German teachers for today's language segment, Friedrich Ville home. The second became king of Prussia in 1786 much of his reign was spent focused on events which would break out in France three years later, the French revolution, the French people rose up against King Louis the 16th and his wife, Marie Antoinette. Not yet. At this point in tending to create the republic, it would become the situation was still concerning to all European monarchs, including German ones. If the people could challenge the monarch of France, it could happen anywhere.

Speaker 1:          33:08          Furthermore, Emperor Yosef the second looked on the situation with more personal concern as Marie Antoinette was his sister in 1791 the declaration of [inaudible] was issued declaring mutual Austrian and Prussian support for Louis the 16th return to power in 1792 at led to the war of the first coalition where the Germans were joined by other powers that as Britain that year frons the second became holy Roman emperor. The coalition forces closed in on France each seeking to restore a Louis 16 to the throne and take a piece of France for themselves, but the revolutionaries proved fully able to defend themselves. In January of 1793 Louis the 16th was executed later that year. His wife followed him to the gaiety. The war continued until 1797 with a French victory and occupation of western Germany. While this was occurring, pressure was distracted by other affairs, namely the second and third partitions of Poland, where Polish territory was completely divided between Prussia, Austria and Russia, and the nation itself ceased to exist in 1797 the war of the second coalition broke out, which saw a Russia enter, but not pressure.

Speaker 1:          34:20          It would last until 1801 with the same poor results for the allies. Furthermore, a young General Napoleon Bonaparte had to become first console of France in 1799 in a coup d'etat, bringing an end to the chaos of the French revolution. But a greater challenge for the Germans is military genius was already shown at a number of battles against Austria and Italy in 1803 however, war was back on yet again. Austria was enthusiastically involved, but again, not Prussia King Friedrich Ville home. The third, his intention was to enjoy a neutrality as Europe tore itself apart. So his wife, Louisa, was becoming increasingly supportive of joining the coalition. Napoleon's attention was eventually on pushing east and the own campaign in October of 1805 the Austrian army was crushed is 60,000 men were captured. Whereas the Polian took only 2000 losses. In November, Napoleon took Vienna itself, and on the summer second that combined Austrian and Russian armies were again a steroid at the famous battle of Austerlitz, forcing Austria to surrender following this surrender cause or fronds.

Speaker 1:          35:28          The second made the bold move to dissolve the holy Roman empire and abdicate from the position of Emperor, the empire seen by Napoleon as an archaic and inefficient organization. Long overdue for reform was transformed into a French satellite state, known as the Ryan booned or the Confederation of the Rhine. Around the same time, however, Emperor Franz did change his Austrian title from Archduke of Austria to Emperor of Austria. One might think that the biggest losers here would have been these smaller German states. On the contrary. Some of them, such as Bavaria in Gutenberg, had actually sided with Napoleon and not only got Austria off their backs, but with the empire dissolved, we're able to absorb many of the neighboring patches of microstates and start calling themselves kings. There. Power had grown overall, but the confederation of the Rhine was still a loose union of about 35 semi independent states. Now under a more powerful emperor, the days of principalities, the size of cities, we're coming to a close except for leakage dine, which remains the living remnant of the empire today, more on that country in a future video of them.

Speaker 1:          36:39          It was now clear to the Prussians that they had remained neutral for too long and a few months later they declared war on Napoleon, but the military prowess of Friedrich the great was not present and his successors and the French defeated the Prussians heavily at the battles of Yana and our Stott and eventually took Perlin. The following year, a peace treaty was signed, which included pressures, loss of land to the other German states, and the new Duchy of Poland. By 1813 however, the tables had finally turned on the Polian, but disasters of the Iberian campaign in Spain and his failed invasion of Russia enticed the allies including Austria and Prussia to challenge him once more. Napoleon was defeated at the battle of Leipzig, but a sys of coalition victory, which would encourage the Ryan Boone to break apart. And four napoleons German satellites states to now switch sides and opposed him.

Speaker 1:          37:28          By 1814 the coalition had taken Paris. Napoleon was defeated and exiled. Famously, he would escape this exile and 1815 and returned to take power once again, but he was defeated again by Britain, Prussia, and other German forces at Waterloo and exiled once more. Most Germans then and today would consider Napoleon a historic adversary with the contribution he made to the restructuring of Germany should not be ignored. At the Congress of Vienna from 1814 to 1815 overseen by Austrian Cummins von Metronik. The European powers met to effectively redraw Europe. The Confederation of the Ryan was not replaced with a revival of the holy Roman Empire, but with the German confederation or the Deutsche of wound, which combine the features of both the holy Roman Empire and the Confederation of the Rhine. It was a little more like the old empire and its ineffectiveness. It included parts of but not all of Austria and Prussia and the president of the confederation was the Austrian emperor, but it only involved around 39 states and followed many of Napoleon's organizational reforms.

Speaker 1:          38:36          Yet the German confederation could not really be called much more of a country then you old empire. It was more like a diplomatic assembly than an actual congress and that even included the king of Denmark as Duke of Holstine and King of Britain as the king of Pan over. The intention of the main power is was to remodel Europe based off the old order wants to pull the and had fallen. Though with some important territorial changes, Russia would gain. Poland, Prussia would gain a large amount of land in western Germany. The congress of Vienna had a profound impact on Europe. Perhaps one of the most peaceful ages of Europe's history followed as from 1815 to 1914 nearly a hundred years, not many major military conflicts between the great European powers erupted. Though there were still some important ones, despite some clamor for reform and internal tensions externally, these German borders here basically remained the same until the 1860s yet tension was building so there was still no Germany as we know it today.

Speaker 1:          39:36          Nationalism reform and a new philosophy was spreading across the continent, which helps encourage the notion of German unity and challenge the views of the age. Austria was a traditional overseer of the German nations, but Prussia was becoming a serious challenger, adding to the issue. As German reformers faced censorship and oppression and many Germans faced a general overpopulation. Many of them decided to emigrate to new countries such as the United States, Canada, and South America. The immigrants brought their culture in lifestyles with them introducing to the world and new foods like the hamburger and strange holiday traditions such as decorating what they called a Christmas tree. In some areas, especially in South America, they're language is still spoken. However, in the u s where a German Americans are the number one most common ethnic group as 14.4% of the population, the language largely disappeared during the simulation. By 1848 discontent became full blown revolution across not only Germany, but many nations of Europe.

Speaker 1:          40:40          The communist manifesto was not by coincidence published in Germany that year. Political tension was exacerbated by feminines economic hardships and other nationalistic separatists movements such as in Hungary. Initially, these movements oversaw successful reforms and even the beginning of what looked like a German nation as the Frankfurt National Assembly formed in May of that year. What exactly this German nation should look like. However, was the first topic of debate, some favor to gross Deutschland, meaning large Germany favoring unification of all Germany with Austria, others favorite Kleine Deutschland, small Germany, x including Austria and it's many troublesome non German domains. The nationalists therefore either way look to Prussia to lead the way to the creation of this germination, but King Fredrick Phil how and the fourth would let them down. He refused the of what would be Germany and by 1849 the conservative factions were winning again and the revolution including the Frankfort parliament dispersed their idea of a Germany would remain theoretical for some decades.

Speaker 1:          41:47          Friedrich Wilhelm was not interested in the political limitations imposed by the revolutionaries nor in a war with Austria over the issue. But he was not completely averse to the notion of a United Germany overall tension was already a building the twin, the two powers and temporarily it seemed as though war would erupt in 1850s but it was averted or more correctly postponed. And the 1860s with tension of her power and the Prussian government between the king and the new parliament known as the long tog a bright and active conservative politician named Otto von Bismarck was called upon to help resolve the disputes in 1862 he was made minister, president of Prussia, essentially second only to the king, the well educated in a skilled diplomat. Bismarck famously stated that Germany will be forged by iron and blood. Two years later, his statement was challenged as Denmark attempted to annex a territory of Chesapeake Holstine, sparking war with both Prussia and Austria, which the German allies won.

Speaker 1:          42:47          The conquered territory was divided between Prussia and Austria, but as you can see, reaching the region was somewhat awkward for Austria and the administration over. It was a subject of contention between the two powers. It would eventually become an excuse for war. Between the two. In June of 1866 he Ostrow Prussian war broke out a conflict for which Bismarck was prepared already ensuring the new nation of Italy as an ally. A number of German states joined Prussia, but Austria was joined by the more major German states. The war would last for only seven weeks with a decisive Prussian victory. Decided at the battle of Cuny greats. Following this war, the German confederation was dissolved and replaced with the Prussian north German confederation. The tables had turned and now Prussia was seemingly the dominant German nation. From this moment forward, Germany and Austria would be destined to different paths.

Speaker 1:          43:43          However, southern Germany still remained independent largely because of internal and external IEE. French concerns over full German unification in 1870 amid rising tensions, war will be declared between France and Prussia remembered as the Franco Prussian war. Thanks to clever maneuvering and propaganda. France was viewed as the aggressor and much of southern Germany feeling threatened. Allied with the north, which is precisely what Bismarck intended. This war would also be short lasting only six months. Ending in January of 1871 the French commanders made a number of egregious errors resulting in a decisive Prussian victory of great importance. Slowly the German states still outside of the confederation move towards unification with the rest of Germany. The last to do so being Bavaria, that same year the north of German confederation became the German Empire under Kaiser Wilhelm, the first Chancellor Bismarck and they right stock a parliament modeled after the imperial diets and thus a nation was born.

Speaker 1:          44:49          This nation, however, born from rapid change, had yet much more change to endure in 1888 to Ville home. The first was succeeded by his 29 year old grandson. They'll Helms Second Ville home. The second was impulsive, excitable, and reckless, possibly suffering from what some historians believe resembles a personality disorder. He stood in stark contrast to Bismarck and the two quickie got off on the wrong foot in a time when the relative peace following the Napoleonic wars was studying to end as tension was building between the European powers Villa home, the second to dismiss to Bismarck from office. A decade later in 1897 Bismarck made two famous statements to Ville home while visiting him for the last time. He warned him that in just a matter of 20 years, a great war would come if nothing was done to stop, it sparked by some damned foolish thing. And the Balkans as he put it.

Speaker 1:          45:48          Bismarck died a year later at the age of 83 16 years before he would be proven correct. It is eerie how accurate Bismarck was, but was he psychic or was he a competent statesman who saw what Kaiser Wilhelm did not see despite what lay ahead. For the time being, Kaiser Wilhelm ruled over a booming nation. Germany became a center for Science, technology, industry, commerce, and culture. The late to the colonialism game, it established a number of colonies in Africa and Southeast Asia. In the areas of modern day, Papa, New Guinea, Cameroon, Namibia, and Tanzania. Germany would also begin a military buildup which concerned France, Russia, and Britain. In particular, the triple alliance of Germany, Austria, Hungary, and Italy had been formed in the 1880s and response in 1907 the triple entente of Britain, France and Russia had been formed on June 28th of 1914 the dominoes set in place came falling down.

Speaker 1:          46:45          We're all the war one began archduke Franz fed and on of Austria was assassinated by a Serbian nationalists and response. Austria invaded Serbia, the complex string of alliances as soon came into effect and by August, Germany and Austria, Hungary, the central powers, we're at war with Russia, France, Britain, Serbia to Belgium and Japan, the allied powers. Within that year, the Ottomans would join the central powers and the year after Italy joined the allied side. Despite pass alliances with Germany, blame for who exactly started the war remains a topic of debate. However, it is very evident that all the major powers were readily prepared for it. Germany attempted first to invade France or Belgium and which forced Belgium to defend itself. Though it had wanted to remain neutral, which encouraged British involvement. Germany surrounded by enemies wanted to achieve victory as quickly as possible, though fighting on two fronts, things initially were going well for Germany, but at the first battle of the Marne, they were prevented from reaching Paris very quickly.

Speaker 1:          47:47          The violence continued territorially. It stagnated as both sides dug into defensive positions across the entire border leading to the infamous trench warfare. Germany's colonies in Asia, poorly prepared for war quickly fell to Japan and British forces from Australia and New Zealand. However, and the African colonies war raged on a war that was supposed to be over by Christmas with a Glorious Durban victory was now clearly going to drag on into 1915 Germany was strained not only by fighting on two fronts, but also being the driving force of the central powers. Neither Austria, Hungary, nor the Ottomans were the empires they used to be, and Austria in particular with spending against the Russia and even Serbia and would soon be stagnating with Italy, Kaiser Ville Helm was reduced to being the shadow Kaiser sitting on the sidelines as his military effectively took control of the nation. Gradually the war shifted focus.

Speaker 1:          48:41          Originally the commanders on accustomed to this new style of warfare. We're seeking great decisive battles in quick movements. In 1915 and 16 it became clear that that was not how the war was going to be fought and that instead it became a war of attrition where each side fight each other and battles and offensive that would cost hundreds of thousands and gradually millions of lives in attempts to deplete the enemy's men. And restores is faster with new devastating technology such as machine guns, tanks, submarines, and poison gas. Halfway through the war, neither side had yet a clear advantage, but Germany knew deep down that if it were a game of who could supply the most men in resources, the allies would slowly when knowing this, both sides gradually became more aggressive. Germany breathe a sigh of relief when Russia exited the war following the communist revolution in 1917 but it was a little comfort as over the course of 1916 and 17 how to deal with new enemies.

Speaker 1:          49:39          Most notably, the United States. America had tried to remain neutral throughout the course of the war, but it had been provoked by German attacks on some of its ships and a secret proposal to Mexico to become a German ally. If America did enter the war in Germany's defense, however, America was clearly leaning towards the side and indirectly assisting the allies, the Germans, new fresh American reinforcements could finally tip the balance in favor of the allies. And that is essentially exactly what happened in 1918 the allies initiated one final push against Germany. And though the central powers fought fiercely. By November 11th the war was over. Germany had to surrender despite the fact that the war lasted only for years. It was essentially the most destructive conflict and human history. Up to that. Estimates vary, but perhaps around 18 million people were killed. With the subsequent treaty of Versailles in June of 1919 the Austrian and Ottoman Empire is we're completely dissolved and broken up into multiple other states, Germany to would have to make serious concessions.

Speaker 1:          50:44          Firstly, it's overseas colonies were annexed by Britain and France. It's mainland territory was divided into new nations or given to France. The army was drastically reduced in size. It accepted responsibility for the war and was expected to pay reparations for the damage it had caused. The German empire was over. Kaiser Wilhelm had already abdicated. Germany was now set to become a republic. The Weimar Republic, Germany was humiliated and broken by as the feet and the peace terms forced upon it to Delta, yet another major blow to the nation. The hard shifts the nation would soon be facing and shame, it felt would lead to an eventual backlash and unleash yet another major conflict on the world that no one could have predicted. Well, actually numerous people predicted it, but either way it was coming as one might expect. The years immediately following the end of the war for Germany, we're a chaotic and turbulent various factions, including notably multiple socialist factions, attempted to use the chaos as an opportunity to seize power in Bavaria.

Speaker 1:          51:51          A socialist republic was even temporarily proclaimed in April of 1919 but was disestablished in May, an event among others, socialists Nomans, which concerned the more moderate German people among the Bavarians who witnessed this firsthand was an Austrian who had served in the German army, adult Hitler to add fuel to the antisemitism in Europe. At the time, many activists such as a Rosa Luxemburg and the Bavarian Socialists states leader, Oregon Levina were Jewish. The German economy slowly took a hit in the 1920s as inflation became worse, as the government printed more money to pay for its debts, the inflation reached levels of outright absurdity far right and left wing groups attempted to capitalize on the crisis. One such right wing party was he nuts. Announced Socialistic Disha Deutscher, our batch apartheid in English, abbreviated as the Nazi party under the Afa mentioned at all. Hitler, Hitler's spoke of a Germany controlled by and ruined by a Jewish elite end of a Germany, which had been unfairly abused by the allies of the first world war is national socialist ideology he promised would reinvigorate Germany and restore its dignity and honor despite attempts to prevent his rise to power.

Speaker 1:          53:04          On January 30th, 1933 Hitler became in German chancellor. Upon his rise to office, Hitler immediately set about consolidating power and silencing the multitude of political parties in Germany. At the time he began building up his army and breaking many of the agreements of the precise treaty, partially in secret, partially right in the open. By march of 1938 Austria was annexed by Germany. By September, the Sudeten land of the Czech Republic was annexed. The international community, or in other words, Britain and France were very reluctant to start another war and thus allowed Germany to NXTs ethnically German areas. Heather then decided to invade the rest of the Czech Republic. Little was done in response, but la only gave Hitler precious time. When Germany invaded Poland on September 1st in 1939 however, Britain and France were forced to declare war Hitler using his uplifts. Craig tactics rolled right through Poland and a period known as the phony war, followed as attempts to resolve the issues diplomatically were made.

Speaker 1:          54:07          Diplomatic resolution did not come in. Germany merely reaffirmed its goals and alliances with Japan and Italy who shared similar goals. 1940 will be marked by a series of unprecedented victories for the Germans, defeating multiple European nations within months or even hours. The rapid unexpected fall of France in June of 1940 inspire the Germans, but the British remained resilient. Vowing to never surrender. German plans to invade Britain were upheld by the invasion of the Soviet Union. Coined Operation Barbarosa occurred the year after in June of 1941 the initial invasion once it's planned until the winter when the German forces unprepared for a long conflict over the winter began to stagnate and the Russians actually somewhat started to repel them that winter as well. Japan declared war on America and Heather joined them despite now provoking two major powers. German military successes continued into 1942 it is during 1941 or so when Hitler gain control on the eastern front.

Speaker 1:          55:07          That is racial designs came further into play. Drawing on accounts as far back as Rome of the blonde haired blue eyed gear money. Hitler believed that the dramatic peoples where the most pure and superior of the area and race, he viewed other races with contempt and endeavor to remove many of them to create layman's around or living space for the German people, millions of homosexuals, Gypsies, the Disabled Slavs that Jehovah's Witnesses, Africans, and most infamously, the Jews were all targets of what does. Remember it as the Holocaust forced into labor camps or eventually killed by fall of 1943 the borders of the axis powers were starting to attract. Russia was reclaiming territory and the allies were invading Italy. The following year on June 6th as Russia continued its advanced, the allied forces from a multitude of nations landed on the beaches of Normandy in France. By December of 1944 the Third Reich was clearly starting to be reduced to its original borders.

Speaker 1:          56:05          That month hit. They're launched his last major offensive, which resulted in the battle of the bulge. By January it had failed and that was soon clear that Germany would not win the war. On April 30th as the Soviets took Berlin, Hitler committed suicide. On May 8th Germany officially surrendered to the allied. It had been the most destructive conflict and world history and remains so to this day with 60 million people or around 3% of the world's population having been killed, including 7 million Germans following the war, German territory was divided among the allies. Poland was permanently given many of the areas of the historic Prussian Empire. The militarism of Prussia was seen as the driving force of the German militarism, which had caused the world wars and in fact, Hitler had idolized Friedrich the grade. Thus, it was seen as wise to stamp out its image. Russia occupied the east of the nation as well as territory near the city of Koenigsberg.

Speaker 1:          57:02          The French occupied the south west and these SAR protectorate, the British, the northwest, and the Americans. The South Berlin was likewise split between the four allies with the Soviets controlling the east. Germany had once again been defeated this time with much harsher punishments. It would not be so quickly reunited. The relationship between the western powers, notably the United States and the Soviet Union was very tenuous. Even during the war Germany, we'd become a main battleground and the immediate conflict which followed the Cold War from 1947 to 1991 gradually, the multiple occupied zones became two separate countries. In 1949 after a period known as the Nazi vacation, the Federal Republic of Germany or western Germany and the German Democratic Republic or east to Germany were formed after less than a century of unification, Germany was once again divided as relations between west and east became more and more tense. Germany found itself in the middle. The Soviets and East Germans erected a wall in 1961 in Berlin throughout the sixties and seventies the height of the Cold War, a number of incidents occurred, which nearly resulted in war in Germany.

Speaker 1:          58:14          By the eighties however, tensions began to relax. By 1989 the East German government had begun to falter on November 9th, 1989 the Berlin Wall was opened officially partially by a miscommunication, allowing Germans to cross much more freely between borders. On October 3rd, 1990 after 40 years of the vision, Germany became a unified and independent nation. Once again, largely in thanks to men such as Helmut Kohl reunified Germany's first chancellor, October 3rd is still celebrated as the togther Deutsch and Einheit the day of German unity. Today, Germany remains a major nation in multiple areas and carries considerable weight and the decisions that affect a Europe, the west, and the planet. We have thus covered about 3000 years of German history, the story of Germany's ancestors, as for the next 3000 years. That depends upon the decisions made by the German people living today.
