Speaker 1:          00:00          Hello and welcome the fire of learning. We've talked about the Viking age somewhat in depth, more in depth I would say than many channels on youtube seem to go, but in this video we're going to finish it off and talk about the end of the Viking age. So what caused the end of the Viking age and what does the end of the Viking age really refer to? Well, many people put the end of the Viking age in the 11th century. After his time, a number of things were happening. Firstly, Scandinavia was becoming more politically centralized. It's here that we really begin to see the beginnings of the modern Scandinavian nations. A main source of whacking opportunity to go rating was the weather class structure was structured. It was a greater emphasis on democracy and really less of an emphasis on having single unquestionable leaders. There's a story in fact of the Vikings in France being asked to identify their leader to which they're applied.

Speaker 1:          00:51          We are all leaders here. Later on, that all changed. The wealthy elite all moved higher at the top. The governments became more centralized and encompass more territory. In the former Viking homelands began to resemble other European nations. Secondly, the north were becoming Christians. Remember that life Erickson had been sent to spread Christianity as far away as Greenland and therefore the urge to resist the Christians, which was believed to be a major cause for the Viking age itself was less intense. In the 10th Century, Harold Bluetooth convinced a Danish to convert to Christianity and all off the first and second of Norway, but brought Christianity to their nations as well. Story sometimes tell if people demanding that a trial be conducted, that pagans would light one fire and Christians would light another fire and a buzzer. Kirra kind of slightly insane Viking warrior known for working themselves up into a terrible rage before battle, possibly with the help of psychedelic mushrooms.

Speaker 1:          01:42          What attempt to pass through each fire in whichever fire he could not pass through was the one which belonged to the Sherwood legend. According to legend and one such events, he passed to the peg and fire with these but could not pass to the Christians fire. Many norths were then convinced of Christianity, civil war emerge and part of Sweden. Over the religion, pagans and Christians took up arms against each other. Though by the 12th century, the people of Modern Sweden had accepted Christianity as well. Furthermore, if Viking explorations sort of slowed down at this time to a viking set, the Faroe Islands and Iceland and Greenland in North America, but around a thousand and they got kicked out of North America and after that in North America was just a mysterious land that they had sent lumberjacks to for what and they stopped colonizing these distant lands. Oh, very likely.

Speaker 1:          02:25          Make a video and the near future of what might've happened in an alternate history where the Vikings continued colonization of American successful successfully, the colony in Greenland as well, would eventually fail over hundreds of years. Green and lost contact with the rest of Europe. The climate change, the growing Calder and hostile native Americans that throw people also moved into the region. A variety of factors is a very likely contributed to the mysterious disappearance of the north of Greenland. By the 15th century, the colonies were likely entirely abandoned. Europe itself was changing in ways that made viking raise less feasible as well. European nations like England and France were becoming more centralized to and they were beginning to maintain standing professional armies, kings of these nations. Quite simply, we're tired of the vikings and Delta fences around formerly vulnerable targets. Viking Raiders who specialize in shock tag like soon, found defenses and standing armies in the way of their treasure making the past time considerably unappealing.

Speaker 1:          03:21          The Viking Age, quite obviously it was coming to an end at the influence of the Norsemen was fading. However, one Norseman Harold Hardrada, King of Norway was not going down without a fight. King Harold to try for some time to invade Denmark. Though he eventually signed a truce agreeing to not invade them. He then turned his attention toward England where the monarchy of the day in law was in trouble. He claimed the throne from himself upon the death of Edward, the confessor the throne. However, it did not go to him. It went to another Harold King, Harold Godwinson and Anglo Saxon last Anglo Saxon too. We have a rural England, in fact, Hardrada dreaming of empire, thus set sail to invade England and claim the throne for himself. In the year 10 66 Hardrada invaded. Though this invasion was a failure. He had arrogantly assume that England had belonged to term and that resistance would soon fall apart and not the battle of Stamford Bridge for which she was very unprepared.

Speaker 1:          04:11          He was defeated by an English army. An arrow struck our drought as throat killing him, and subsequently many historians say ending the Viking Age within the next 200 years of vikings would be kicked out of Ireland and Scotland as well. The Normans would assimilate to the rest of France and Russia would become a primarily Slovic nation. Liking a settlement and exploration had ceased. Their empires had been repelled. The raids had stops. Their religion, culture and society has had assimilated largely to the rest of Europe. The Viking age was over. This is by no means though means they're influenced or that the north's themselves had disappeared. Quite notably, only three days after Harold had drawn a died in England. William the conqueror, King of Normandy, set out to conquer England. Of course, remember Normandy was the land that the king of France gave the Vikings over a hundred years earlier. Many people attribute the Norman Conquest to being a conquest of the French, but in fact they were French Viking.

Speaker 1:          05:02          His invasion was successful and its affects last to this day, and that is only one example of how the north and the Viking age in general help shaped modern Europe. The Viking societies themselves would evolve into modern day Denmark, Sweden, and Norway. They're calling either the well became the modern nations of Iceland and the Pharaoh islands. Furthermore, they linguistically, culturally and politically influenced England, France, Russia, and the Baltic states, as well as other places as well. So in summary, it's entirely justifiable to have mixed feelings regarding the vikings by our own standards today. They were in some ways abhorrent and awful. People there. Infanticide, murder, rape, pillaging, and general destruction is justification to hate them really, and be glad that they are a thing of the past. But other than Norris around at the time, who developed a rich, somewhat democratic culture and society who set out to build better lives for themselves and explore new lands and to impact of the world in many positive ways are entirely worthy of being as admirable ancestors of the West.

Speaker 1:          05:59          We can look at the men of women who moved to unforgiving and unknown frontiers like the Faroe Islands, Iceland, Greenland in North America, and perhaps draw inspiration from them as we are ourselves. Begin to look toward the unforgiving frontiers of the solar system, for example. And that's all I have for the Vikings for now.

Or as a north would say, fuck of fear. Rare for watching. Oh, by the way, I forgot to mention Vikings, then an accident where horns on their helmets. That's a myth.
