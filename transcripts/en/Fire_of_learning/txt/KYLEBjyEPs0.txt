Speaker 1:          00:00          Hello and welcome the fire of learning and the next few videos we're going to be doing an overview of what is it called, the Viking age. The Viking age began in the late eighth century and lasted until the mid 11th century, marked by the beginning of raids on neighboring settlements by Norris Raiders and known as the Vikings. The word Viking, very likely is it related to plundering, exploring and or adventuring their influence on European society. Language and culture was a major having lasting effects which influence us to this day. They were in many ways an early medieval power influencing societies from Spain to southern Italy to Russia and feared and known all the way from Canada to the Middle East. They're sea fairing abilities and exploratory accomplishments predate the rest of Europe, hundreds of years settling places like Greenland, Iceland, and discovering and even colonizing North America hundreds of years before Christopher Columbus was even born.

Speaker 1:          00:50          They were an accomplished but also misunderstood people. As much of what we know about them came from accounts from their enemies and therefore much work has been done in dispelling many misconceptions and false ideas. Considering the fact that a lot of misinformation about vikings exist here, even on other channels on Youtube, I've been extra careful to avoid information that is in factual. In this video, we're going to talk about the history of Scandinavia leading up to the Viking age and a number of events occurring in their homeland and in Europe, which have very likely contributed and caused the Viking age. The Vikings came from the region known today as Scandinavia, which today is Denmark, Sweden, and Norway. This region had historically been occupied by dramatic tribes. Many of these tribes went on to evolve into the north societies at the vikings came from during the time of the Roman of the region was largely cut off from the Roman empire being separated by Germany, which successfully repelled room invasions and halted their desire to expansion northward.

Speaker 1:          01:43          However, archeological evidence proves that Roman goods did make their way into lower Scandinavia and tribes from their region did at times participate in wars against the Romans, particularly those from modern Denmark being mixed in with the other nearby Germanic tribes. The people here were fairly interesting. They had somewhat democratic tribal societies. In which all land owning men and in fact the land owning women without a husband to present them. How does say in the tribe a system which didn't really change until the later iron age when we're like kings began to take over the society, Kingswood later support the material wealth of their societies by plundering others. However, even in these societies in Norris had a democratic undertone to their culture and society and many land owners in North Society's believes that they should have a say in their chiefs in or later kings decisions following the fall of the Roman empire.

Speaker 1:          02:28          The peoples of this area enter into what's called the Germanic irony age. And notably this is the same time period in which the Danes Appearance Scandinavia. The Danes spoke a similar Norse language as that of other tribes in places like Sweden and Norway. And they sell them parts of both of these places in northern Germany and of course for the most part, the Danish march or what is today called Denmark. So these north societies begin to take shape and evolve in such and eventually the people here have an urge to expand. And explore and migrate to new places, but people here began to build great warships, develop newer technologies, and began raiding various places and even eventually settling, knew previously undiscovered lands, thus marking the beginning of the Viking age. But the question is why. I mean to be fair, Scandinavia wasn't exactly the spotlight of your prior to this point in history.

Speaker 1:          03:16          What reasons and events drove them to begin this highly influential Viking age? Well, a number of things were going on at this time in Europe and very likely a combination of factors contributed to the sparking of this age. One factor is possibly that Scandinavia at this time was becoming overpopulated. Scandinavia is a cold and not particularly fertile region and this of course is place limitations on agriculture and general food production and obviously the population might have been restricted by this. This is something which stuck with a Scandinavian nations throughout history and even today, their populations are still comparatively smaller. It's entirely likely that people having such a region want to go out and raid other societies for resources and eventually settled out other areas. It wasn't necessarily that they were just sick of the weather. Some of these places like Iceland and Greenland, we're not much more a group of apple climates, but they were open territories with land available for set for settlement and the vikings were interested in that especially because it was an opportunity to get away from the burdens of Viking kings in politics and as such have their home nations and politics based on the Viking accounts were definitely motive for emigration.

Speaker 1:          04:21          However, there isn't much evidence to support the idea that there was a famine occurring in Scandinavia at this time. There may have indeed been enough for the population to get by. However, there may have been some problems with the population itself in North Society at the time, there was a heavy emphasis on having male children to the point at which, and fantasize sometimes occurred towards female children. This while being sad and cruel and itself was likely responsible for an imbalance in the sexism. Many norths men were motivated, motivated to find wives and begin families and other lands where there were more women. However, the fact that they didn't just go and bring women back kind of suggests that this was not the main driving force either. Another major event to take into consideration here is that the beginning of this age occurs at the same time as both Charlotte, his empire, and the increased spread of Christianity.

Speaker 1:          05:09          The Nourse who were pagans were very concerned about the Frankish empire, the Franks being the early French, especially as the empire went right on their southern border and some conflict occurred, especially as Christianity spread throughout Scandinavia. The North's peoples were rather abrasive to Christianity. In fact, that Christian forces often simply killed Scandinavians who refuse to convert to the religion, did not encourage them to change their perspective. Many people believe that the vikings may have felt compelled to defend their societies and religion and general way of life from the foreign threats, and even though Charlemagne's empire began to decline heavily after his death, they may have pursued this defensiveness and use it as justification during the Viking age, especially because Christianity did not go away. Another motive, quite simply is just that they may have known that they could, they were developing new technologies, specifically better tools, weapons and warships.

Speaker 1:          05:58          They were becoming a more organized society, and importantly, some of their neighbors were weak, fragmented, and susceptible to attack and history across the world unfortunately shows that when the strong have an opportunity to take from the week, they jump on it. And that's precisely what the Vikings did. One of those weaker neighbors was north Umbria, a predecessor to English society, where in the year 793 the Viking age began. And what? Talking about that in the next video to keep up with this series and for more videos like this and on many other subjects, be sure to check out fire of learning and subscribed. Thank you for watching.
