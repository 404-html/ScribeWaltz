Speaker 1:          00:00          Hello and welcome to fire learning. Thomas Jefferson was one of the founding fathers of the United States of America. He authored the declaration of independence, served as America's second vice president and it's third president. Aside from his political roles, he was also a man of science and philosophy, being curious of the entire world around him in his very long an eventful life. He left us with quite a bit of advice on both a personal and national level and in this video we're going to share that advice. Keep in minds, however, these are Jefferson's quotes, not necessarily ones which I personally agree or disagree with, so let's get to it. Number 10 the most valuable of all talents is that of never using two words when one will do. Jefferson had quite a bit to say, but he was remembered for being a quieter man in his many years of politics.

Speaker 1:          00:50          He encountered a lot of bloviating and useless talk and he had no interest in it. When he spoke or when he wrote, he was very much the points and a declaration of independence. Where she authored is a document that perfectly portrays this. It is very much to the point number nine, history in general only informs us of what bad government is. The United States was a nation which did not only go to war to become an independent nation. It's war of independence was also, and probably more importantly to most Americans, a war fought to embrace new ideals that were less common in Europe, which was primarily ruled by monarchies or in England, a constitutional monarchy, plain and simple. Thomas Jefferson did not like government and in fact, majority of founding fathers shared his opinion that government should be as limited as possible because it and their view typically worked against his subjects or constituents.

Speaker 1:          01:44          The founding fathers disagreed on where that line was exactly, but Thomas Jefferson is indeed on the far end of the bunch in terms of disliking government. And number eight, timid men prefer the calm of despotism to the tempestuous sea of liberty. Jefferson did not believe that once the war of independence was over, that freedom would be an easy road from there. Americans today have a proverb that is similar to this. Freedom is not free, but most Americans do not understand this to the extent that Jefferson did as he had lived in a time when that freedom was not guaranteed and was hard one liberty, he believed with something that must be guarded from accrual and wild world on all sides by individuals, not something that has rewarded after a single struggle. Only strong people that were willing to constantly defend their freedom. We're going to keep it.

Speaker 1:          02:31          He believed. Number seven, I sincerely believe that banking establishments are more dangerous than standing armies and that the principle of spending money to be paid by posterity under the name of funding is but swindling a futurity on a large scale. Jefferson is essentially saying that working yourself into debt with the expectation that a future generation will pay it off is a very bad idea and that banks pose a greater threat to nations than army to do. Jefferson believes that the habits of European nations, including those that economics, we're not necessarily models be followed. Jefferson argued against things like a national bank, and in fact even claim that each generation should be expected to pay off their debts within 19 years worth pondering and modern America's economic situation. Number six determined never to be idle. No person will have occasion to complain of the want of time, who never loses any.

Speaker 1:          03:24          It has wonderful how much maybe done if we're always doing. Jefferson did a lot in his life and he wouldn't have gotten so much done if he was not a productive and efficient man. Jefferson believes that a good cure to feeling like you never have the time to do the things that you want to do is to make use of all your time and never waste any. If you want something done, get to doing it as simple as that. Number five, if a nation expects to be ignorant and free in a state of civilization, it expects what never was and never will be. Jefferson, and in fact, many of the founding fathers openly spoke about their opinion, but a people's wellbeing was inescapably tied to the level of education and intelligence. He believe that freedom of speech opened the doors for things like education and ideas and such things to flow more freely on their own.

Speaker 1:          04:13          But he believed furthermore that, uh, people should make an effort to better themselves with an education as a means to safeguard their freedom and longevity. Number four, I never considered a difference of opinion and politics and religion and philosophy as a cause for withdrawing from a friend. Jefferson had very strong political views and he regularly encounter people with whom you strongly disagreed. He helped fight a war over a political disagreement and yet still in his personal life, other people's politics, religion or philosophy. We're not necessarily what constituted a good person or friend and Jefferson's eyes. Sometimes people just think differently. And Jefferson had the ability to respect that. Number three, do not bite at the bait of pleasure until you know that there was no hook. And he said, this is Jefferson's advice for an aspect of the human condition that we are all sometimes guilty of a, we do things in the moment that feel good that we'll have longterm negative consequences and be when someone promises us good.

Speaker 1:          05:12          We may at times over look the potential bad and it is the latter part of the Jefferson focuses on more specifically a king may promise us prosperity and wealth for our generation. However, establishing a monarchy in long run may in Jefferson's opinion be detrimental for generations to come that do not share in that prosperity. Number two, I hold it that a little rebellion now and then is a good thing and as necessary in the political world as storms and the physical Jefferson does not like the concept of a system which maintains an indefinite prosperity because he doesn't think it's realistic. He believes that the political arena has to be shaken up quite a bit regularly in order for freedom to be maintained as it's just another part of life. He even somewhat hinted the notion that the American government, which he helped found would in time change in forum and begin to encroach on its citizens, and Jefferson suggested a regular revolution would keep this inevitable attempt on people's freedoms and check number one, do you want to know who you are?

Speaker 1:          06:14          Don't ask. Act Action will delineate and define you. We all of course wonder what it means to be who we are in many different ways. But Jefferson says that our self is not something that we searched for and eventually find, but rather something which we create. Oftentimes we may be looking for a path in life when the best path is the one that we have to build ourselves and the paths that we ourselves build and Jefferson's eyes to find us as individuals. Jefferson, of course, despite being a quiet man, had much more to say, but these are some of his most profound and celebrated quotes from what we do is like this and videos on many other subjects.
