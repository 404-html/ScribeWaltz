Speaker 1:          00:03          Oh there, it's October and that means at the end of the month, Halloween is coming, but when you think about it, Halloween is kind of a weird holiday. It's centered around the dead, the monsters to creepy and things. We generally find unpleasant. We carve faces into pumpkins and put candles and then we decorate our houses and more costumes relevant to this holidays purpose. It's the one time of year kids can get candy from strangers. What is going on here? Well, for the origins of Halloween, we'd have to go back to at least 700 BC to the Council of Europe, specifically Ireland, Scotland, Wales, and Gaul and the Celtic festival of saw when or shop and he spelled s. A. M. H. A. I. N. It's a Celtic word and it has a very pronunciations. Often I hear it pronounced saw one. However, with my understanding of the Irish language, I would personally pronounce it Shaaban. Anyway, sanguine or shoving occurred on the night of October 31st and the early morning of November 1st it was celebrated as a middle between the RM equinox and the winter solstice and it was celebrated as the end of the harvest and as a pagan religious holiday and fires were lit up just

Speaker 2:          01:16          as they are today on Halloween. Sometimes cows were started for their meat for the winter and a festival is held. Alcohol was consumed. In fact, it is notable to say that Merce stories in Vulcan alcohol begin on saw. I went in Irish mythology and legends. However, Shovin had a darker side to it. The cat's believed in other worlds. I was sort of their own and occasionally these worlds were open between each other. People venture into these other worlds. After her death, other times the living could wander in and come out alive. The mythology of these worlds tends to vary from tried to try, but some other worlds were very pleasant, others were very dark. These other worlds. We're open to many times in legend, but we're open specifically on two nights, the night of Belton occurring and the night before May 1st centered around the living and sobbing occurring on the night before November 1st it's centered around the dead.

Speaker 2:          02:13          Shaaban was as somewhat dangerous night, but they're always been not celebrate with literacy and take precautions to protect themselves as on this night dark spirits to roam the countryside at the barriers between the realm to the living and the dead were broke. These dark spirits were known as the ash. She on fire served many purposes and that mythology, one of which was to drive away these as she. Some people would attempt to appease these spirits by leaving food and drink outside of their home for any of that might pass by perhaps one origin of trick or treating and others would attempt to scare the spirits off by wearing intimidating and flight for costume. Another customs surviving these days later when the Romans conquered modern, they France, which was in largely occupied by nerve traditions mixed and became associated with the Roman festival of Kimono celebrating the Apple Harvest.

Speaker 2:          03:06          And the origin of apple bobbing and even picked up on some Roman traditions involving the debt which also held the fires and drove off evil spirits and had similar ideas of honoring the dead but Roman traditions involving the dead removed from February to the end of October. Eventually though Christianity spread of the calcium a place many of their pagan traditions, some Celtic Pagan holidays were destroyed by the new religion. Others were converted into Christian celebrations. Siteone is an oh off the bladder becoming all hallows eve or holy evening in the 17 hundreds of Scottish began shorting the phrase all hallows youth assembly Halloween this weekend, the partner, the word for the holiday and it's spread throughout Europe. The three day religious period of all hallow tie and Christianity and involved in many customers are evolving the civically around honoring the debt specifically those are good heart and the Christian faith.

Speaker 2:          04:03          It involved abstinence from me. Lighting candles for the deceased consecrating graders was only water or milk and many other traditions and customs which varied and in fact still vary from country to country. However, in the Celtic nations, the legend of the ashy and the traditions of shower when we're not entirely lost in many practices and traditions continued and evolved into their modern forms and Scotland. Children went around them. It can these spirits, but painted faces in costumes demanding to be welcomed by strangers and to be given treats or else they would play a trick on their victims. Eventually, this became more common right Cole and expected this trick or treating spread to England and in America in the 20th century, they have tradition of carving faces into vegetables. Specifically. Turnips also continued to this time and included eliminating them by placing candles inside them related to the legends of the word of the WISC or Jack of the lantern, the legend of jack-o-lantern. It's that of Stingy Jack. When invited the devil to have a drink with them. He made a deal and a few mistakes, but the apple, which led to neither God nor the devil wanting him in their realm upon his death, the devil giving him a piece of coal tells him to find his own health and as one or the earth with a lid, piece of call instead of carbs.

Speaker 1:          05:19          Fair enough. Since the Celts card faces in the turnips, which were lit similarly, both to commemorate the legends and the scare off Stingy Jack, though when they came to America, the Irish found the pumpkin made for a much more decorative and affective fruit for design. Hence the creation of the Jack o lantern. The large number of Irish immigrants brought Halloween to the USA and Canada. Where does a huge additional and commercial event today becoming bigger? There isn't perhaps the Celtic nations from which it originated. However, Halloween wasn't finished there in the Victorian era. Gothic literature assembly came wildly popular. Dark Tales of the undead core scenes of the macabre and uncomfortable were invented and thrilled to readers across Europe and North America. Stories like Bram Stoker's Dracula. I trust that your journey from London has been a happy one and that you will enjoy your stain. My beautiful man, you want a friend Mary Shelley's Frankenstein,

Speaker 3:          06:21          you will rejoice to you that no disaster has accompanied the commencements of an enterprise which you have regarded with such eel for boating

Speaker 1:          06:30          and the works of Edgar Allen Poe. The red death devastated the country. No pestilence ever been so fatal or so hideous influenced Halloween's identity much for it and the 20th century more aspects of religious practice and fascination with the gothic light continue to influence Halloween until it reached its great popularity in western and even world cultures they'll be getting as a pagan holiday and later as a Christian holiday. It is viewed now mostly as a time of fun and a positive expression of a darker side of the human mind and experience. Some religious groups believe Halloween to be an event of say 10 a ritual at the majority of Christians believe neither Halloween north saw when to be as such. And many people, even non Christians and even non Westerners readily celebrate the holidays with mistake. And so the event of Halloween was forge of the course of 2,500 years by calts, Romans, early and modern Europeans and North Americans as well as other groups influenced by both pagan and Christian religious aspects as well as shadow religion legend and chilling literature and media such as the gothic tales from the Victorian era as well as a whore and books and films and imagination up today.

Speaker 1:          07:51          To recap, the wearing of costumes, the decoration of houses and bonfires and such were originally designed to scare off the dark spirits and Celtic mythology known as the s she trick or treating. It comes from children pretending to be these spirits by dressing up as I'm an orthopedic Stuart. The items left but these spirits by threatening tricks if they weren't received bobbing for apples came from Roman traditions. Pumpkin carving dates back to the legend of Jack of the lantern, originally associated with a turnip until the Irish found the Pumpkin in North America. Bonfires candles and even setting a place.
