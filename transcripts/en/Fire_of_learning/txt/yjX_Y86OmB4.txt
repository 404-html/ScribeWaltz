Speaker 1:          00:00          Hello and welcome to fire of learning. The big five and the Myers Briggs types. Both seek to quantify our personalities through analysis of our behavior thoughts, decision making, preferences, perspectives, and the like. Usually through a self report test. The two are actually similar in many important ways and the Nbti you come out as either an I or an e introvert or extrovert and the big five. This of course correlates with the extroversion scale and the NBTI. You're either an n or an s intuitive or sensor and the big five there's a correlation with this and the openness scale in the NBTI. You're a t or f thinker or a feeler in the big five this is the agreeableness scale and Bti Jrp judge or perceiver big five the conscientiousness scale. Now granted these two don't line up perfectly, which you can see that they are trying to measure very similar aspects of our personality which are very core to who we are and how we live.

Speaker 1:          00:59          You can pretty reasonably expect therefore that someone who tests as an INTP line up somewhere in these areas on the big five and versely, someone who scores this on the big five probably will end up as an ist Jay on the NBTI. Nevertheless, it's no secret that the scientific community strongly prefers the big five over the NBTI. Many people in fact completely dismiss the Nbti as just being modernized. Astrology in favor of the big five. Why? Well, I've argued against this in the past so I'm not going to go too much into it in this video, but I don't think that it really makes sense to consider the NBTI modernized astrology and in strongly favor the big five. I mean they operate in a pretty similar way and measure pretty similar things granted. Sure. The NBTI following mad times make it seem a little ridiculous, but you can't always judge something based off its fan base and yes, there is the issue that people take the test two separate times and get two different results.

Speaker 1:          02:04          Does that mean that these assessments are a completely whimsical and invalid? Not necessarily. We also have to consider that sometimes the test taker may be at fault, that there's perhaps an issue with getting a self aware and intellectually honest self assessment from the general population, but that's of course not the issue with everyone, which I'll get to. There was some problems with both of these tests, but there are a number of things to the NBTI Aleks and fails to address that the big five does not, which is why the scientific community really favors it and which is what we're here to talk about. The first obvious difference is that the big five includes a category that the NBTI does not neuroticism. This has to do with the amount of time you spend subjected to negative emotions. Higher scores tend to feel anxiety, fear, depression, anger, loneliness, that kind of stuff.

Speaker 1:          02:56          More often than lower scores in the NBTI. If you type Imtj that doesn't tell someone whether you're possibly struggling with neuroticism, maybe mental illness even or whether you're not, but that's a very important part of who you are and how you live, especially from the viewpoint of a psychologist, whether they're studying an individual or a population. Secondly, there's an important difference in how the results are presented in the big five. Your results are placed on a scale intended to represent your average behavior and feelings with the NBTI. I've noticed that some scales have been implemented in some tests, but each letter is basically a dichotomy which to some seems like either or black or white. The introversion and extroversion scale is a pretty simple example of this. Are you an introvert or an extrovert? For those of us in one of these areas, in the big five it's probably pretty obvious, but for those in this area, people who exist in the range of amber version kind of, it might be a little more unclear, but the NBTI doesn't always highlight that.

Speaker 1:          04:01          It essentially assigns you I or II and of course the same situation happens with the other letters as well. The NBTI does a good job of giving 16 types, but it doesn't represent the variation within each type as well as the big five does. And so if you're on the border between two different types in the NBTI, maybe try taking the big five and see if you land in the middle is maybe why. Ultimately both tests can be useful tools, depending on what you're going for. But from an academic standpoint, the big five is the clear winner.
