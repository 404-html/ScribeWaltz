Speaker 1:          00:00          Hello and welcome to fire learning. Often when we talk about the evolution of our animal companions, we focused on the gradual transition from wolves to dogs, but how about our feline friends? Well, in this video we're going to explore how cats evolved. The line that led the cats broke off from the line that led to other failings such as lions and tigers, only about 10 million years ago, much later, cats probably quite simply evolved from the African wild cats Faley Sylvestri sleeve. It costs about 10,000 years ago, which looks much more like a modern cat than a wolf does. The average modern dog and in fact actually exhibits much more similar behavior to modern domestic cats and dogs and wolves. Do and we'll get to that in a second though we can still obviously easily contrasted to though humans did in fact a medicaid other cat like animals and other parts of the world.

Speaker 1:          00:47          Genetic studies have shown that all domestic cats around today are descended from the aforementioned African wild cat with whom they share the closest DNA match. Now, the date of 8,000 BC, 10,000 years ago is important and it can be contrasted with dogs who were domesticated a few thousand years earlier. Dogs were used by our ancestors primarily for hunting and protection and things like that, but the evolution of the cad coincides directly in the same time as and in the same place as the origin of farming 10,000 years ago in the Middle East. That's a real likely, not a coincidence. Cats were very likely not used for plowing fields, but they almost certainly were involved in the food production process or more specifically food preservation process. How well rodents, the food produced by humans at this time was of course at risk from infestation by rodents and rather than have the humans take care of the problem themselves, they probably simply adopted the cat to do its job.

Speaker 1:          01:41          Gradually friendlier and friendlier. Cats were more open to interaction with humans. The humans dust domesticated them and we entered into a fair mutual exchange card, our food, which attracts mice and you can keep all the mice you find. However, the steel wasn't probably so solidified in pursuit of a process as it was with dogs cause aren't quite as social as dark because I don't interact with us in the same way and they don't follow our commands as well as any cat owner would tell you. What happened with cats was probably more so a coincidence, more like biological mutualism, then specific directed artificial selection. Some would even say that if humans were looking to control the rodent population there would have been better animals at a time to domesticate and utilize it in the cat. The very first evidence we have of cat domestication comes from the island of Cyprus around 9,500 years ago.

Speaker 1:          02:28          The year 7,500 BC alongside human remains. Presumably the former owners, this location and men are variable are both important and providing evidence that this was indeed the time in which cats were domesticated as a, there were no cast native to the island to begin with and seeing as how cats are stereotypically not fond of swimming, someone would've had to have brought them there and be one, would very likely not bury themselves with a wild animal, especially one is trivial as a wild cat. So assuredly by this time humans and cats, we're living together. Cats played the in modern human civilization as well. In ancient Egypt, the charge for killing a cat, it was often the same as killing another person, which was often death. This was due to the CAS importance in Egypt and religious practice. The Romans helps spread cats across Europe where they were valued as an independent pet and seen as a symbol of individual liberty actually and during this time cast spread at the Far East as well.

Speaker 1:          03:21          In the Middle Ages, cats were seen as a symbol of bad luck and they, especially black hats were warded off and sometimes killed go naturally. They going to come back and today there are an estimated 600 million domestic has around the world. So that's how the domestic cat evolved into its current form. If you're interested in hearing how any other animals evolved and Mesic or not, let me know in the comments section below and I may do a video on it. And more videos like these and videos on many other subjects. We should have checked out five of learning and subscribe. Thank you for watching.
