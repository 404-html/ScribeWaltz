Speaker 1:          00:00          Hello and welcome to fire of learning coffee, one of the world's most valued commodities. The 25 million people employed in the coffee industry in some form, produced a 9.3 million tons of coffee beans worldwide each year and help turn it into the 500 billion cups of coffee. We consume yearly in a variety of ways and styles. All this consumption has made coffee the second most traded commodity in the world after oil, but the drink that some of us now feel that we need every day was not always there. In fact, it's a recent addition to the world compared with many other drinks and products. The relationship between coffee and people has more humble origins as a wild plant here in east Africa today, Ethiopia, the story of coffee begins in the ninth century and there are legends that an Ethiopian goat herder named Caldy noticed it as goats had become very energetic after having consumed the berries, have a strange plant, which we now know to be coffee berries called.

Speaker 1:          01:01          He then tried the berries and after having been surprised by the enjoyable, energetic feeling that came, brought them to a nearby Islamic monk who first tried to burn them and disapproval, but then noticed a pleasurable smell coming from the seeds from within the roasted coffee berries and then ground up and dissolve the emmers into water, creating the first cup of coffee from their coffee spread across these Islamic world. The story was almost certainly made up perhaps a thousand years or so after its claim to take place, but it's probably true that Ethiopians had discovered the unique effects of the barriers of the cafe. A plant around the time that the legend takes place, the knowledge of this and the beans themselves, which aren't technically beans by the way, just look alikes. They're seasoned fact probably soon enter the nearby Islamic world within a century or so though the actual drink we know and love would not be made for a few centuries to come.

Speaker 1:          01:56          That story takes place across the Red Sea and a country none then and now as Yemen. The stimulating effects of coffee beans were possibly first described by an Arabic polymath named Muhammad ibn Zachariah. I'll Razi or more simply Rosie's around 900 a d though it was definitely mentioned by the Persian polymath I Ali [inaudible] or [inaudible]. Later that century, around this time period, Islamic monks began cultivating a plant and turning the fermenting berries into a kind of wine, none as Kesher. The first evidence of coffee as the drink we know made similarly to how it is made today in fact, comes from the 14 hundreds it is not known who first invented it or where exactly it was invented. Some ambiguous reports say it was a Muslim chic named Jamal, all dean, all the Bonnie and 1454 but the first clear reports of it come from Sufi Muslim monks again in Yemen who used a drink to stay awake the night for religious purposes.

Speaker 1:          02:56          It would then be spread rapidly across the Arabian peninsula and into the rest of these Islamic world. By the year of 1500 people were drinking coffee from North Africa to Turkey to Persia, all originating from the Yemeni port. City of Mocha. I named carried with coffee to this day. The meanies would take great care to protect their trade, requiring all coffee beans to be boiled and sterilized before it can be shipped out to foreign lands. Though of course, as we shall see, it would not be protected forever. No one knew it then of course, but the stimulating effects, which may coffees or popular come from a drug within it. Caffeine, caffeine like nicotine and morphine in fact evolved in the end susters of the cafe. A plant as a way to keep insects from eating it. Insects which consumed a plant were killed by the effects of caffeine.

Speaker 1:          03:45          So yes, Caffeine essentially originated as an insecticide. Thankfully, it's effects on humans and other animals are less toxic. It's stimulating effects on humans come firstly from the fact that it mimics a chemical release in our brains known as adenosine. Simply put, as we go about our days and energy is released, adenosine builds up in our brains. The more identizine which builds up the sleepier, you get as of course, as process signals to your brain as you had been using energy. Caffeine, however, is molecularly very similar to identizine and it's capable of binding to the adenosine receptors in the brain, but it's not similar enough to activate them just to block the identizine from the receptors and therefore prevents you from feeling the tiredness that you'd actually be feeling. The world's most consumed drug does more than just this though. It's effects also lead to an increase of adrenaline which increases heart rate blood flow and creates a feeling of energy.

Speaker 1:          04:42          It also helps release dopamine which improves mood. All of these factors encouraged. The popularity of a drink is one which improves mood, energy, focus and thinking. However, as I said, no one at the time knew anything about this as caffeine wouldn't be identified. In fact until 1819 by the German chemists, free league, Ferdinand Ruena throughout the 16th century coffee. We continue to gain popularity in the Middle East with mixed reception's not everyone, particularly Orthodox Islamic and moms liked it and its effects along with the fact that coffee houses in the Middle East typically allowed prostitution, astrology, and other things which weren't necessarily appreciated by Islam, led to it being banned and multiple places on several occasions such as Mecca and 1511 and Cairo and 1532 but it was too late for the opponents of coffee. As many including powerful leaders like the Ottoman Sultan, Suleiman the first had already taken a liking to it.

Speaker 1:          05:40          Leaders like Solomont across the Islamic world overturned many of these bands and press for copies. Acceptance in Islam, coffee began to reach Europe a few decades later. Europeans first reportedly encountered coffee on the island of Malta where the knights of Saint John Having taken Ottoman Turks, slaves during the great siege of Malta, founders slaves repairing a drink and try it, some of it for themselves. And 1565 in 1573 coffee was described by a traveling botanists and physician named Laonard rivals who called Shaba. While in Aleppo, he wrote a beverage as black as inc useful against numerous illnesses, particularly those at the stomach. It's consumers take it in the morning, quite frankly in a porcelain cup that has passed around and from which each one drinks a cupful. It is composed of water and the fruit from a Bush called Buena Buena wasn't named the Ethiopians gave to the plant which was described in Arabic.

Speaker 1:          06:38          Though the Arabic word for coffee at the time was cowatch not long after in the 1580s and nineties as the Venetians began increasing a trade with the Muslim world, coffee found its way to mainland Europe from Italy, the Arabic word Koala became Covey in Turkish and Italian became cafe and French cafe and other languages took on similar names becoming coffee and English as in the Muslim world. The Christian world also reacted hesitantly to coffee. Many people enjoyed it and it spread rapidly through the continent, but many criticize it, calling it a Muslim drink or even a better drink of Satan. Debate would last over the drink until about 1600 when Pope Clement the eighth who his reign was marked by conflict with the Muslim Turks, tried the drink and light enough to declare it a Christian drink. Throughout the 16 hundreds coffee became a hot commodity in Europe and many trading companies focused on importing it.

Speaker 1:          07:35          Coffeehouses opened up across Europe, the first one on mainland Europe outside the Ottoman Empire being in Venice in 1645 the Yemenis had tried to safeguard the production of coffee, but of course failed in their endeavors. Attempts to smuggle live coffee seeds out of Yemen and creased in 1616 of the Dutch succeeded in doing it and attempted to grow the plant in their homeland and in their colonies in modern day Sri Lanka and Java and would later focus on the production in the East indies. The Dutch would begin to spread coffee. Third Trade to places like Japan as well. The plant, of course, prefers a tropical climate and 60th 70th Sophie monk smuggled several coffee beans from Yemen to India and to the Kingdom of Mysore where the plants grew and not only successfully remain there, but allow the plant and a drink to be eventually successfully spread across the world. From the Americas to the east.

Speaker 1:          08:29          Assisting the spread was the failed siege of Vienna, where in the victorious European forces looting Ottoman camps, discovered coffee beans that had been brought with them. They'll coffee had been declared a Christian drink and spread across Europe rapidly. Coffeehouses were a different story. It's perhaps ironic that the introduction of coffee to Europe correlated closely with the age of enlightenment, but it is indeed true that many enlightenment thinkers across Europe met at coffee houses to discuss a number of topics including social, political and religious reform. The famous French enlightenment thinker Voltaire, for example, is said to have drank up to 80 cups of coffee a day. The monarchs of Europe would attempt to crack down on seditious and rebellious talk and activity during the enlightenment. Some such as Charles. The second of England would target these coffee houses, specifically closing many of them down. The French Naval Officer Gabrielle declaw is often credited with having spread coffee plants to the Americas in 1720 accounts telephone him nurturing a coffee plant during a voyage, sharing his water ration with it.

Speaker 1:          09:36          In fact, until he was able to plant it in a French colony of Martinique where it came to be the ancestor of huge amounts of the coffee plants grown today. However, we now know that coffee was growing into French colonies. A sound a mean now, modern day Heidi and the Dutch colony of Suriname just a few years prior. Regardless, Duclos efforts are an important moment in coffee history. The production of coffee though having many different methods across the world, essentially boils down to the same steps and has since its creation and Yemen. Coffee, as I said, originates from the cafe trees. Within a few years, the tree begins producing fruits known as Coffee Cherries. These trees can live to be up to six years old when the cherries are ready. The seeds are separated from the first through a variety of methods. These seeds, as aforementioned are the coffee beans there are left to dry out in the sun and then a coding none.

Speaker 1:          10:30          As parchment is removed, the seeds are then roasted and then ground up at the end of this process. One is left with coffee grounds, right to make coffee with. While coffee had become popular in Europe, it's still also has to compete with tea and alcohol and a number of other drinks. In colonial America in particular, it was not very popular at first. That is of course until the 1770s during the revolutionary war when t became a product, very much associated with Britishness. I'm sure a fellow American viewers can think of famous incidents such as the Boston tea party. As an example, coffee became a popular alternative. However, it was in short supply and prices rose considerably. Nevertheless, from the foundation of the country, protests of tea and the coffee becoming what is culturally seen as America's choice of caffeine, though rather popular now and spread across five continents, coffee was still not exactly cheap and was available regularly.

Speaker 1:          11:26          Only still wealthier and the ability that would begin to change. However, in the 19th century following Brazil's independence from Portugal and 1822 expanding the coffee industry was very much seen as an opportunity to encourage the new nation's economic growth. It did so I'll be it unfortunately in the beginning from the work of slaves which led to Brazil being the last western nation to outlaw slavery in 1888 but Brazil's coffee had led the coffee becoming a drink of the masses or in other words, a cup of Joe. Once coffee production is plentiful, people were quick to regularly consume it. A trend which never went away, it would be a breakfast food for average citizens are recreational drink fuel for the productiveness of the world for soldiers and laborers as well as philosophers and scientists I drink, which was made in the Arabian peninsula from the seeds of plant found in Ethiopia, is now regularly consumed and available across the world.

Speaker 1:          12:24          To this day, Brazil remains the number one producer of coffee in the world producing about a third of all the world's coffee or about 3 million tons. It is followed by Vietnam and second place at one and a half million tons, Columbia and third with 750,000 Indonesia and fourth at 640,000 tons and Ethiopia, the home of the coffee plant in fifth place at 470,000 tons. The two main varieties of coffee grown our Arabica and Robusta. These major producers along with many other significant producers unsurprisingly are located in a region of the earth, ideal for the growth and health of the cafe. A plant known as the coffee belt. Coffee has never been more diversified than it is today with many kinds and tastes. Many additions like milk or to use the Italian word for milk Latte as well as cream and sugar originated in Europe in the 17th and 18th centuries.

Speaker 1:          13:21          From these simple combinations, coffee and its varieties would diversify greatly. There are even now coffee flavored things like coffee flavored ice cream and cake. A common kind of coffee is decaffeinated coffee as you might guess for the name coffee without caffeine or in reality, just a small amount of caffeine. The process of removing caffeine from coffee was discovered in 1903 by accident by a German merchant named Ludvig. Rebellious Caffeine is removed from the unroasted beans using solvents or a times just water. It is not made from the roots of the plant economists. The amount of caffeine in a cup of coffee is usually about 95 milligrams per cup or per eight ounces. Though it of course varies greatly. Comparatively, there are anywhere from 70 to 115 milligrams of caffeine in a cup of an average energy drink, 40 milligrams in an average cup of tea, 40 milligrams, and a cup of most soda beverages in about five milligrams in decaf coffee.

Speaker 1:          14:19          Plain coffee itself is not really nutritious, but the caffeine in it carries a number of health effects. As I said, the drug has a number of effects on people. Generally these are positive increasing energy, focus, attention, mood and motivation. Though for many, most notably people with anxiety disorders though those without them as well. Sometimes it can be negative as an increase in adrenaline and other factors create anxiety, nervousness, jitteriness and his comfort. The higher the dose of caffeine. The more one is at risk developing these symptoms as well as sweating insomnia, indigestion, headaches and nausea, scientific studies. How predominantly shown however, that a normal consumption of coffee, even a few cups every day, is not detrimental to the health of the average person. Further, a specific study on coffee is lacking. However, studies suggests that coffee consumption may extend your life and improve brainpower. However, it is not known exactly which illnesses are staved off or how exactly this is done and only also a general doses.

Speaker 1:          15:22          Regular excessive consumption of coffee may have a negative effect on lifespan. While a coffee may not affect cancer much other way, it may be good for heart diseases. It is also possible that copy's slightly lowers the risk of type two diabetes, dementia and Parkinson's disease and as an appetite suppressant may help you lose weight. It May, however, lead to an increased risk of dry skin, hypertension, osteoporosis, heart attack, and may have a 14% increased risk of lung cancer. Though this last one only amongst smokers. As a result of all this. Caffeine is not recommended for those with cardiovascular diseases, anxiety disorders, insomnia, and other similar conditions. The exact health effects on pregnant women have yet to be determined. This is all quite a bit, but caffeine is, as I've said, a fairly safe drug and if not consumed and excessive amounts likely won't ever be a problem for most as is usually the rule with drugs.

Speaker 1:          16:19          The higher you rise, the harder you fall. Coffee's main ingredient. Caffeine is not nearly as intense as other stimulants like cocaine or amphetamines and its withdrawal symptoms are likewise much lighter symptoms of caffeine. Withdrawal, however typically include headaches, fatigue, problems with concentration as well as depressed mood, constipation, muscle stiffness, irritability as well as others. So if you find yourself wanting to give up coffee, it might be easier to slowly cut back on intake and then maybe switch to tea and then come back on t and so forth to avoid caffeine. Withdrawal Coffee is, as I've said, great for the economy. It accounts for 63% of Brazil's exports just as an example and is therefore a main source of revenue for that country as well as many others. It is important to note, however, coffee production does have a negative effect on the environment. It requires a considerable amount of water which is problematic for dryer nations like Ethiopia.

Speaker 1:          17:17          Traditional methods of growing coffee along trees have also fallen out and its production increases deforestation and habitat destruction. The use of pesticides is further harmful to the environment. In fact that up to this point pesticides have been even more harmful to the predators of paths and a pest themselves creates an even bigger issue and all of these issues will have to be addressed as the demand for coffee and the strains on the environment continue to grow.
