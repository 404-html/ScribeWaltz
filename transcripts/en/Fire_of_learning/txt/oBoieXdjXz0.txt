Speaker 1:          00:00          Hello and welcome to fire of learning. And this video we are going to be talking about the NFC intuitive feelers intuitors you will notice are moderately different compared to those sensory counterparts. Now even though nos and NTDs are only one fourth of the population, I'd bet the majority of you watching this tested and because Meyers Briggs type psychology is a topic which tends to attract intuitive types. And in this video we'll be focusing again on the NFS, the IFP, the NFP, the I of Jay and the enf Jay. Now you'll notice s's are divided between perceiving and judging, P and j whereas ends are divided between thinking and feeling. T and f. Y will, I'm not entirely sure why this is the common way of doing it. It seems unnecessary as having intuitive perceivers and intuitive judges would be equally sufficient. But I will say though that even though as you will see an J's and nps calve considerably different functions stack just as the SS, how they appear on the surface and the kind of habits, interests, lifestyles, et cetera that they develop are moderately similar.

Speaker 1:          00:57          So what's the big deal about the end as divide? Well, as usual we'll get to the cognitive function explanation and a bed, but for now will be sufficient to say that like all ends and s are more interested in sort of what if or abstract concepts and possibilities they may trust there in to feelings over what their senses are telling them and they're particularly good at reading between the lines and information of whatever nature or a sensors can see if things by starting with facts and then forming a larger picture and try to grasp the whole picture at once and then work out the components and like all F's feelers ns prefer to make decisions and judge things in accordance with the system of morals and values which they focus on a polling and refining throughout their lives and will often aspire to curry conditions which are fair and equitable for everyone or an essence create harmony as I've stressed feeling and Myers Briggs, it's not equate to emotions.

Speaker 1:          01:45          Afs may have a greater focus on emotions and in fact a better understanding of them. But the irony is that thinkers may at times be worse at handling their emotions, but more on that later and F's are usually bright, caring, friendly, sociable and creative people. They will often place emphasis on human relationships and interactions both on the small and large scale from the people close to them to a larger social picture constituting the relations of humankind. No often place great emphasis on ideals and values. So the values developed by intuitive feelers are not always necessarily in accordance with common or traditional values. They will often more independently develop an idea of how society should interact and exist and in fact in abuse society's values as short sighted, shallow and a moral being particularly critical of hypocrisy in consistency and inauthenticity. These traits may encourage them to be somewhat rebellious and to become active in movements of other conservation of some things or a change in others.

Speaker 1:          02:38          This is not the say that they're stubborn or and flexible like most theaters there are generally friendly and easy going and only become combative and certain lines across. They do, however, expect themselves to adhere to these morals. Very strongly believe that doing so is it necessary in their quest to connect with their inner selves or to find their place in the world. However, in relation to the people they care about, they will often try to see the best and then there will be more likely to reach out and help them then to be accessibly critical and order them we could say and to shape. However, when stressed or otherwise unhealthy and F's May become selfish, defensive, argumentative, impulsive or unreasonable, they may switch from attempted to see the best and others to seeing all the negative aspects of people on society. Seeing the core of humanity is being shallow, helpless, and inherently corrupt.

Speaker 1:          03:21          Furthermore, while striving for ideal relations and circumstances is admirable and useful, there's subjective value systems and as IRS for other people may come into conflict with objective facts, which NFS may find to be cold, robotic and inhuman in certain situations and so usually capable of understanding logical reasoning and being logical, but they may have difficulty in conflicts in which a logical course of action is not exactly the most moral or ideal, especially if it affects others. They care about. If NFC not ever come this to may stagnate or in deer, unnecessary pain in situations such as unhealthy relationships or unhealthy employment, worse, they may begin to solve problems and negative ways because I know it's have a higher sense of others' feelings and intentions. Then it become manipulative and coerce others into things. Most are not though, especially commonly in most Ns, come to balance these traits throughout their lives.

Speaker 1:          04:07          Often they're focused on ideals and their skill with people and their ability to grasp the big picture. Well, we'll try going to subjects like philosophy, literature, sociology, politics, psychology, et cetera. And as you will see, many notable figures within these fields throughout history have been an apps. Now, of course, as usual, to truly understand these types, we have to look at the cognitive functions beneath the surface. So here are the four types. Again, the IFP, the NFP, the inf ga in the enf Jay, and here are their associated cognitive functions. So as you can see it, like I said, Ns maybe similar people, but they opt arrived for these similarities with fairly different decision making preferences at perspectives. If that makes sense. Essentially the circuitry is a bit different and as you can see, no shared functions. They're both intuitive feelers because they're to lead functions are both intuition and feeling, but they're opposite focuses.

Speaker 1:          04:54          Nfj Is r, N I and Effie, introverted intuition and extra feeling. Well NFP is our FII and an e introverted feeling and extroverted intuition with their inferior functions. Likewise of course being opposites. And of course you see here the flip flopping of function preferences between introverts and extroverts have the same type. So I've said that there are differences, but the question is what differences are they? So let's break it down. Starting with the opposite intuition functions. So what's the difference of the introverted intuition of NF Ga's and the extroverted intuition of nfps? Well, of the four dichotomies, the difference between an eye in any is probably the most difficult to understand. Maybe even the least solid difference in Myers Briggs, they're both functions focused on ideas and concepts and possibilities. But Eni function is more on connecting concepts if it'll larger picture. Whereas n he is a bit more like idea generation or brainstorming sort of what you might expect from what introverted and extroverted seem to imply.

Speaker 1:          05:52          So I NFJ is and Ian of J's are going to focus more on tying points together to reach a single or a more refined understanding of things. Kind of like a system building process that may just intuitively know how or why something is the way it is. And this may be expressed by moments where they pause and say something like, wait a second, I know exactly what's going on here. Something like that. And even though the very sociable, they particularly I fjs may seem to daydream a lot and seem kind of pensive. All intuitors can be somewhat pensive and NFJ is of course no exception needing to sort things out in their head from time to time, especially introverts. And in he ifps and enf is however is a bit more random, not in the sense that nfps have short attention spans or something. Often when an NFP gets interested in something, they focus on it with a lot of enthusiasm, but they do kind of jump around from topic to topic and are very receptive to new ideas.

Speaker 1:          06:44          So much so that they may feel uncomfortable making up their minds about somethings he nfps who lead with any, especially because there's always something new to explore or to do. They may develop new interests and change their hobbies within just a few months and then come back to the much later, which is a major contributor to why NFP is are a little bit more bothered by routine than NF js. They're very good at brainstorming and ige idea generation, as I said as well, and then maybe focused on taking things and trying to find new ways to do things with them, which are perhaps the only new original or random. We've talked about any before as an inferior function, but as a lead function, nfps are usually very good at taking in something and then asking, well, what if we do this to it? What if we make it like this?

Speaker 1:          07:23          How about if we change this? Things like that. They're very good at playing with concepts. Now, the difference in feeling extroverted feeling versus introverted feeling. We've talked about introverted feeling leads before with the ESF p and the s and p and it's essentially the same function and inf fees, any NFPS, but the way it's expressed in combination with intuition is moderately different. FIS is a function with sort of the world by a system of values and morals, which is the NFP people spend their lives trying to connect with refine and exhibit and themselves. They're very aware of their sense of right and wrong. Keep in mind though that this is a more independent sense of right and wrong. They may be unusually virtuous expressing morals that much society would not, or on the other side, they may develop some fairly crooked morals and be fairly disagreeable people.

Speaker 1:          08:07          They're also very aware of their own emotions. Even when they feel emotional or overwhelmed, they're usually more aware of what they're feeling and why and are accordingly more steady in dealing with things and monitoring their emotions. Whereas fes can be zero to a hundred if particular emotions or provoked in a certain way, but more on Effie in a second like SFPs. NFP is, wants to refine their morals and act in accordance with them, but while SFPs maybe more focused on doing this by getting out into the world and learning how it is, I guess you could say nfps and combination with any often prefer to do this with ideas, concepts, symbols, metaphor, et cetera. There are a bit philosophic and how they ponder things. This comes out in a smaller scale. When NFP is our explaining or arguing that tend to use a lot of metaphors to convey their introverted feeling, reasoning on a larger scale, they'll, they'll probably take interest in things like literature, music, arts, certain sciences, et Cetera.

Speaker 1:          08:54          Literature is a good example. Both nfps and NFJ is can be excellent writers, but a very good example of the Fsi in any combination inaction is talking and I NFP and his books more commonly and his movies at the Lord of the rings Middle Earth is a wonderfully developed fictional world. And to credit him much more so than a lot of popular fictional worlds of our time. There's histories of entire fictional civilizations. He covers a whole history of his world and detail. He invents languages, things like that. That kind of thing is at an end you would just enjoy creating an a level of creativity that they're fully capable of. Looking at this story specifically, it's full of symbolism. Taking the one ring in particular, I can symbolize a lot of negative traits of humankind's such as the desire for power to the point where people like Gandalf for Aragorn or l Ron feel like they can't handle it.

Speaker 1:          09:39          So the task falls on Frodo, who is by the way, typed as an IFP, as far as fictional characters go, which typing fictional characters can be awkward to do and lead to a lot of mistakes, but it falls on him because even though Frodo is just this little guy from an uninformed, unimportant place, he's courageous and he has unbreakable virtue and talking obviously implies that this is the kind of character which is necessary for human kind of triumph over evil, which is very, very stereotypical of NFP writing. But anyway, that's my nerdy tangent example. Let's talk about Effie in the NFJ js like f. I. F he has also expressed differently an intuitive types and their SFJ counterparts, which we talked about before. If he has a function dedicated toward a focus on the feelings and intentions of others. In essence, it's very focused on people and in fact, fes may tend to be strongly affected by how others, especially people, they care about our feeling to the point where the emotions of others can influence their emotions much more significantly driving them to try to help out as accordingly.

Speaker 1:          10:35          I don't mean to be misleading here though. This is not necessarily mean that Nfj is are pushovers. They may accommodate others in certain ways but maybe very, very adamant and their principles and are much more likely to try to convince people that their position or belief is right or beneficial rather than silence it for group harmony. And importantly not all of them want to be motherly caretakers who just love everybody and if Jason May be very good with people enf fjs in particular are usually good at breaking the ice with people whereas inf shades are quieter and further smaller circles and such. But a focus on people and increase intuitive awareness of their emotions and attention is not necessarily mean a love of people. And in fact from personal experience, and this is just personal experience I take with a grain of salt from the NFJ is I know several of them have expressed annoyance with how unpleasant the general people general people can be and several of them aren't even going into professions where there'll be working with people, but combined with their intuitive sense when they do work with people, not only are they obviously good at it, they like it to be for a higher purpose and this is Austin.

Speaker 1:          11:35          What makes them exceptional leaders and we can see this type of leadership in leaders like Martin Luther King Jr, Bernie Sanders, Gandhi, Thomas Jefferson, et cetera. All NF. Jay's despite their ability to help others are not always good with our own emotions. Though it may struggle with their own feelings and maybe feel they may feel unappreciated if their efforts going noticed, if certain lines are crossed. They may, as I said, go to zero to 100 and react very strongly now for the difference in the thinking functions and fjs prefer preferred. I interpreted thinking and nfps preferred Tki, extroverted thinking. Tiaa is a focus on organizing one's understanding of the world into an internal logical framework. It causes people to try to consistently refined their understanding of things and connect them into a sort of logical system. In NFJ is his function is of course often superseded by f e and an I, but Nfj is with a particularly strong TEI sense, tend to enjoy logic or puzzles or math.

Speaker 1:          12:26          They may like science or technology and they're very good at systematizing things from the perspective of an INTP. It's always been interesting to me to see and I, and t I worked together a sort of tie in the background systemizing the intuitions and when you combine this with f e you may get something like all of this Myers Briggs types in the cognitive functions. There is some debate over INTP or inf, but these two types that can be actually kind of similar on the surface too, but a lot of people believe that Carl Young was an Imfj. Carl Young is of course the psychologist who developed the cognitive functions on which Myers Briggs types are based. T. I also of course, comes out when NF Ga's are stressed or when it's encouraged, when they're confronted and arguing with people who are being excessively emotional to become very logical and the response and critical people displaying extreme emotion for no reason, especially if it's just disrupting harmony and fps, prefer a tee extroverted thinking, which is of course focused on the efficient organisation of the external environment's planning, organizing, or finding moving things, et cetera.

Speaker 1:          13:25          Even though it is of course superseded by the more preferred functions. This of course comes out in multiple ways. In nfps it comes out and how they organize things. I may have sort of moments of enthusiasm where they want to clean and organize everything and get things in order. It comes out when they're put into leadership positions. Not all, especially I nfps enjoy leadership, but sometimes they do and when they do, they made us play organizational behavior more in accordance with how a key lead would act. Then an NFJ would with Evie using extroverted thinking to enforce her district justification of fie to establish an ideal order. Essentially NFP is tend to be very relaxed, easy going, people who are open to suggestions, which can cause them to be indecisive, but when circumstances require it to, they'll make decisions represented by a tee and enter into a kind of TC ob mode.

Speaker 1:          14:11          Furthermore, I can draw them to take interest in certain things such as engineering, sciences, math, computers, law, et Cetera. And is also of course a parents and teaching and social work positions, which nfps tend to be attracted to when confronted with an argument and sufficiently angry nfps will often express FII with both any antiquey where they may try to get to the bottom line of things, perhaps very adamantly and say this is just the way that it has to be or something like that. And the final function is of course sensing and be for STI and of Shay's prefer s e s as we focused on more in depth in the SGA video as a function dedicated toward associating experiences to form a larger internal framework of why things happen and what happens when those things happen. And as I is accomplished this by being very focused on specific facts and details about the things which take place.

Speaker 1:          14:58          Often they will use this function to support and help develop f. I. N, N, e, I, n fjs and Enf js prefer s. E extroverted sensing. So they may have a tendency to be a little bit more athletic and coordinated. The may enjoy sports or physical activities somewhat more than May in combination with Effie. Feel an urge to go out and do things with others, may have a fairly good sense of fashion and they may at times be a little bit more spontaneous or impulsive. Now, an NFP may be a little bit impulsive sometimes too, but in many situations they may take a few seconds to make up their minds about things, whereas an Nfj may, especially if encouraged to be more likely to just jump right into something and whether or not that is a good thing is of course, relative to the individual and the situation or Clayton.

Speaker 1:          15:37          So in conclusion though, nfps and NF Jays have opposite function stacks. It turned out on the surface to be somewhat similar. People, they're often likable, intelligent, independent minded and caring people. Their ability to grasp large concepts easily and they're intuitive insight into the functioning of the world has been responsible for a great number of positive and often much needed changes in human history and their desire to improve themselves and others will often lead them, fulfill the role of standard bearer or lead or encourage others to an ideal on a small scale such as helping a friend or resolving a conflict at work or a larger scale such as leading the way for an improvement for the whole of society. And now for some NF statistics and I've seen general constitutes 16.4% of the u s population. The NFP mix up 8.1% the I NFP makes up 4.4% the enf j makes up 2.5% and the I NFJ makes up a 1.4% with the inf Jay being the rarest type of all famous NFP is include Mark Twain, Alan Watts, Che Guevara, Robin Williams, and Ellen, the generous famous I NFP is include Shakespeare's Yung Joc Rousseau, had girl in Kurt Cobain and John Lennon, famous enf.

Speaker 1:          16:45          Jay is included, Cicero, Barack Obama, Johann von Gutta, Neil degrasse Tyson, and Jennifer Lawrence and famous inf Jay's include Plato and Niels Bohr, Leon Trotsky, Marilyn Manson, and Cate Blanchett. So that's the intuitive feeler is in a nutshell. And the next video we're going to be talking about the Aunties, the intuitive thinkers, and we'll wrap up the analysis videos. That may be, we might have a few Myers Briggs videos after that, but that will be the last of the analysis videos.
