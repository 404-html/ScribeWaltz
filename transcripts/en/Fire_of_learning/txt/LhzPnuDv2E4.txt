Speaker 1:          00:00          Hello everyone. As we get into the final days of 2017 I'd like to take the opportunity to encourage you guys to share your comments, questions, concerns, suggestions and all that sort of thing. As we look toward the new year, a problem a lot of youtube channels have I noticed is that they don't respond to their audiences and I value your guys' input. I read all your comments and I take would you guys say into consideration as a way to improve my channel and so I wanted to do this and then make a video sometime early January responding to what you guys have said. Two big things. I get, for example, one, I talked too quickly and too, I sound too monotonous. Sometimes. Those are things which I have been trying to improve on and I like to say that I think I've gotten better since the spring and summer of this year. Secondly, I want to reiterate, I do not mind if you guys correct or criticize me because fire of learning holds truthful, factual on biased genuine information as a top priority because I honestly believe that that kind of information deserves a safe haven and this kind of world and I know that there are plenty of you out there that share the same frustration and I would rather have a dumb mistake called out then help perpetuate something that is wrong just so that I can look like I have a giant perfect, admirable brain and I appreciate that you guys have corrected me and I've tried to give you credit and the comments of videos where I have made an error not to spend too much time on this point, but I would add that saying I'm wrong or that my video was bad without explaining why just comes off as pompous ship posting part of my French and I can't really do much with it.

Speaker 1:          01:40          I have more videos coming before the end of 2017 and the coming year I have plans. I admit I work spontaneously and wing a lot, but I do have some plans. There was more science I want to cover, probably going to try to do overviews of the histories of a couple other nations and peoples like I did with the Vikings and England. I know you guys like the top 10 tips videos and I'm going to cover some new topics too and that's another thing too. I am always interested in hearing from you guys what topics you guys want me to make videos on. So I just wanted to make a video explaining where fire of learning is at and encouraged this opportunity for you guys to give your input. Thank you all for watching over the past two and a half years. Thank you for getting fire of loading two, almost three and a half thousand subscribers. Now. Welcome to all of you who are new, be on the lookout for new content. I have coming out. I have a busy schedule often, but I do make an effort to keep videos coming. Happy holidays to everyone. Happy New Year and thank you all again for watching.
