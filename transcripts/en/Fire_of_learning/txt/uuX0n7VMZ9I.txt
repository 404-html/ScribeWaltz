Speaker 1:          00:00          Hello everyone. This is Justin here of course at fire of learning and I figured it was time to make a video like this and also well past time to thank you all for your contribution to this channel. August was a big month for fire of learning. We hit 20,000 subscribers and the history of England documentary reached 1 million views. That is really incredible. I could not have done it without you guys literally, but what I mean to say is that I greatly appreciate you guys and I'm glad that we've been able to form this community centered around some pretty cool topics this month. We've finished the two hour long Ireland Documentary and I've made 21 other videos and four other documentary videos this year so far quite simply my plan for the rest of the year is to keep bringing you guys a content that you're here to see. One thing you guys have noticed that I've been doing is consistently making polls on all kinds of questions in the community tab.

Speaker 1:          00:57          That started as just a way to get to know you guys better, to know who I'm talking to and also to get feedback from you guys and it still is, but at this point I've been thinking of continuing with these questions and then doing a kind of fire of learning sense as video where we compare the results of all the Poles, probably compare them to the results of the general population and discuss them. I hope I'm not posting too many poles to be honest. I'm not 100% sure how they work from the viewer's perspective, the channels I followed don't do them as often, but I just figured it'd be a very interesting opportunity. From what I've seen so far. You guys have a lot of different perspectives on the world. You guys probably come from all walks of life and from many different countries, but what interests me as well is that you guys are a group of people, very likely, smarter than the general population.

Speaker 1:          01:49          I'm not trying to kiss your ass or anything there. I'm just saying that people who spend their time getting enjoyment out of watching educational youtube videos are probably not dumb people. And so it's an interesting opportunity I think to be able to pull intelligent people on these big questions. A big problem that I'm really not a fan of his, that I'm limited to five options of pole. I was barely able to do the religion pole as a result of this, you know, Buddhism, Hinduism, et Cetera, all fell under other and you know, I don't know how I cleanly do a poll on something like race or ethnicity because of this, but you know, we'll work with what we've got. So if you'd like to take part in the census that I'm doing, feel free to go to the community tab on my channel and go vote.

Speaker 1:          02:36          And other polls because they're all still open. Also, I'm pretty sure these polls are anonymous, at least I don't know how to view who votes for what unless you comment. So don't feel like your answers are being watched, you know, vote how you truly feel. Speaking of polls and my most recent one I asked you guys to rate fire of learning. The Paul is still ongoing. I'm glad to see that the great majority of you guys think the channel is at least four stars, but 12% see it as three stars and even a couple of people, two or one star. As for the three stars. One comment I got was that I don't post videos enough. He made this comment to be very constructive criticism, which I appreciate and I know many of you feel the same way. I am trying to be more productive with video making and to get more videos up.

Speaker 1:          03:24          I think I am getting faster, but at the end of the day I am just one guy and something like the history of Ireland videos which put together are two hours long. It takes some time. You know they're really 12 videos, which are 10 minutes long put together because of course most of you guys prefer longer videos and I prefer longer videos myself actually. So I just want it to respond to that so that you guys didn't think I was ignoring your comments and let you guys know I am working on more production or being more productive because in the end that benefits everybody, but I did want to just say also that the videos I make do take some time as for the one or two star voters, I'm not sure what the route is there. I had one guy who voted one star comments saying he doesn't even follow the channel.

Speaker 1:          04:11          He's never seen one of my videos, but the polls show up on his speed, which I don't get. But Hey, if you're watching this, come check out my stuff. I know obviously some trolls fall on my channel. Plenty of them comment in a fire of learning. You are a communist and arc is Nazi trying to indoctrinate the youth with anti white white supremacist propaganda and I hate you and your family. I get that kind of thing pretty usually, but I'm still obliged to view the responses on the Poles as serious. So whatever your rate, my channel, let me know in the comments of this video what you think I can add or do better. Then go ahead and leave. And the other questions, comments or concerns you guys have in the comments, and I can even just get back to you guys and the next channel update, we can do another type of a Q and a type thing. So thank you all again for taking part in this channel. There is much more on the way.
