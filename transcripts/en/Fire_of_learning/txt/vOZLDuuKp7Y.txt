Speaker 1:          00:00          Hello and welcome to fire learning. Contrary to some belief whom is not just a fancy way of saying who there is in fact a grammatical difference. And in this video we're going to take a look at that difference. The simple answer between the difference of the two is that who is used as a subject and meaning it's used as the doer of an action in a sentence. While whom is the receiver of that action, the object of a verb or proposition. Let's look at some sentences here for example, who who is cleaning their car and this sentence we're looking for the doer of declining. Therefore who who is washing fire of learning and this sentence we are looking for again, who is doing the watching, who is yelling at him and this sentence we're looking for who is doing the yelling. However to flip it around the bed we can employ whom to the same well similar sentence at whom is he yelling?

Speaker 1:          00:52          Because the person in question is not the one doing the yelling, but the one being yelled at the correct word here is whom? For the more notice we said at whom, not whom. It's yelling ads because it's improper to end a sentence with a preposition, but that's a topic for a future video. For whom are we looking here, the focus is on the individual for which the subject is looking, not the person doing the looking. Whom do you believe? Here again, we're not asking who is doing the believing, but we're asking about the person being believed. One helpful tip to remembering this concept is simply if who can be replaced by here, she then use who however I can if it can be replaced by him or her use home. Take a look at these sentences, which one is correct.

Speaker 1:          01:38          All right, now try these. If you answered B for both of them, then you're getting the hang of it. If not, just keep working at it. It's perfectly understandable if it takes a second to understand considering the fact that we actually make this mistake a lot in common speech, I make the mistake and common conversation all the time. I've probably made a mistake plenty of times and my past videos, but it's very important to understand English and be able to use it well.
