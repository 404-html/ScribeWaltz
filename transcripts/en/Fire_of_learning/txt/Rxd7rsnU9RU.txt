Speaker 2:          09:42          My purpose in making this video is quite simply that I see the colorization of these photographs as an extremely effective way to connect on a deeper level to the past. There is of course a value to photographs in their original black and white state, but too many people, especially those of us who were born at a time in which car photography became the norm or the lack of color in these historic photographs almost seems to separate us from those time periods, these images from the civil war world war one, even world war two seem almost like our civilizations faded memories, distant remnants of our past. When you add color to them, you realize just how important of a factor colorist to connecting in a sense of something to relate to it. Viewing is so worse orders. For example, he seemed like ghosts in black and white, like ancient history, add color and the picture comes alive.

Speaker 2:          10:31          You can place yourself was in it much easier. Their uniforms and their environment and their flesh are compared to the original, all the more alive. You know there's picture from World War One could have been taken the other day and that was over a hundred years ago. It's easier to form a mental picture of and naturally ask and relate to what it might've been like on that day as opposed to a colorless antique of an archaic war. We've only had photography since the early 19th century. This photo taken around 1826 is the earliest known photograph. That's incredible. We can go back that far and see something, a photograph, and of course, keep in mind this has been greatly enhance from the 1820s just a decade after the Napoleonic wars, only 50 years after the American war of independence. That's really cool in my opinion, but it means we've only been taking photographs for a little under 200 years and color photographs only we can a norm in the 1960s which is almost about 60 years, but the past 9,800 years of human civilization or so prior, there are zero photographs and we can connect to those times through art and continuation of culture and language and various things of that nature.

Speaker 2:          11:37          But it's needless to say, that photography, how has allowed us to connect to our past in a way that has not been seen in history. So while again, these original black and whites are valuable in their own right, adding colors, and he's older. Photographs, in my opinion, helps to maximize our ability to connect with our human past.
