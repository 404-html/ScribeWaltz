Speaker 1:          00:00          Hello and welcome to fire of learning. Carl Sagan was an American scientists known for his work as a science educator, but he was not merely a teacher. His vision was to get average people interested in science and emphasize the importance of scientific knowledge and understanding and all roles of life from politics and economics to quality of life and general wellbeing. His most famous works stressing this philosophy and quit a number of books such as the demon haunted world and the dragons of Eden. And of course his famous TV series cosmos. Carl Sagan believed that abandoning science in the modern age could lead to catastrophe. So in this video we're going to look at 10 pieces of advice. He left us on how to build a society, which does not make such a mistake. So let's get to it. Number 10 people are not stupid. They believe things can reasons.

Speaker 1:          00:50          The last way for skeptics that get the attention of bright, curious, intelligent people is to belittle or condescend or to show arrogance toward their beliefs. Oftentimes the truth tends to come into conflict with religious, political, philosophical, common sense notions or previously how scientific thought of how the world works. People are not always so ready to give up these beliefs. Their values and opinions are not always as flexible as a scientist should be. It is clear that Carl Sagan believes wholeheartedly and embracing the truth, but he cautions that there was a professional and mature way to go about introducing the truth. Average people may disagree with something otherwise logical simply because they view it as the opinion of the enemy. Seginus argues is that relating to them and showing respect for them and their beliefs while introducing it, perhaps painful truth to them, we'll make it somewhat less painful and you'll find them to be less abrasive.

Speaker 1:          01:42          Number nine, if it can be destroyed by the truth, it deserves to be destroyed by the truth. While Carl Sagan suggests a nonaggressive and mature approach to debate and discussion, he does not believe that the truth should be surrendered to fit people's conceptions of the world. What is true is true because it has been shown to be true and in the realm of science. The only reasonable grounds to say that something is not true is to prove it otherwise. That's the end of the story. Number eight for me, it is far better to grasp the universe as it really is then to persist in delusion, however satisfying and reassuring. This is closely related to the last quote and that Sagan is again reiterating that the truth is to be held in the highest regard. It is very unwise to hide behind the comfortable life, especially in circumstances where understanding the truth is of great importance to our lives.

Speaker 1:          02:29          Typically hearing these quotes, we may imagine a creationist or something advocating their usual arguments. However, this way of thinking is useful for more than just debating creationists on reddit. We can take this advice to politics, to our social lives, to our personal perspectives of ourselves, to our values and beliefs and apply the same unwavering respect for the truth as a means to better ourselves. Number seven, the absence of evidence is not the evidence of absence. Science demands evidence before something can be confirmed to exist. While it would not be wise to be certain of something such as the existence of aliens, which I believe Carl Sagan was speaking of with regard to this quote originally before on your found, there is a good amount of reason to believe that aliens may in fact exist if there is no evidence for or against something than science has no opinion on whether or not something does or does not exist, and the question then is worth pursuing further.

Speaker 1:          03:23          Number six, the nuclear arms race is like two sworn enemy standing waist deep in gasoline, one with three matches, the other with five Carl Sagan of course lived during the Cold War when the threat of nuclear war between the United States and the Soviet Union loomed over the world. Carl Sagan regarded such a thing as nuclear war as one of the most dangerous consequences of avoiding science and reason regardless of what one might think up to two sides and their disagreement to these disagreements. Being settled over a nuclear war had the potential to reduce huge parts of the entire world to ruins even the victor of such a war with suffer the consequences of a fractured civilization and utterly destroyed global environment. While Sagan completely agreed that a more peaceful solution to the problems that the world powers face is ideal. This is a perfect example of why world powers understanding science could be crucial to avoiding disaster.

Speaker 1:          04:18          Number five, science is a way of thinking much more than it is a body of knowledge. Many of these codes have been suggesting this point. Science is more than an encyclopedia of colorful insects and violence stars. The scientific method or more broadly and understanding of the philosophy of empiricism introduces a new way of thinking about the world with an emphasis on, you guessed it, what is true, factual, correct, and things of that nature, even if it is uncomfortable. Number four, the cosmos is within us. We are made of star stuff. We are away for the universe to know itself. Carl Sagan also famously said, the nitrogen and our DNA, the calcium and rts, the iron in our blood, the carbon and our apple pies were made in the interiors of collapsing stars. One of cross sagans must important arguments for why we should pay attention to the entire universe around us and endeavor to understand it is that we are inescapably a part of it and subject to the forces that governance, we are not separate from the universe.

Speaker 1:          05:20          We are the universe as well, and that perspective can change things quite a bit. Number three, the fact that some geniuses were laughed at does not imply that all who are laughed at our geniuses, they laughed at Columbus. They laughed at Fulton, they laughed at the Wright brothers, but they also laughed at Bozo. The clown science is filled with tales of great minds whose work was originally disrespected and disregarded even though it turned out to be true and quite profound in the end. Such stories encourage people to stand in the face of unwarranted criticism and defense of the facts. However, a downside to this is that people may be reluctant to catch on when their work is. In fact, not all that credible. Don't jump the gun just because something seems profound. It might be ridiculous. Number two, we live in a society exquisitely dependent on science and technology in which hardly anyone knows anything about science and technology.

Speaker 1:          06:14          Consider for a moment all the objects and forces around you, all the tools you use and the things you do throughout the day and how you do them. Many of these things may only function and appear in the ways that they do because of scientific understanding. That took centuries to arrive to the loss of such knowledge and a lack of respect for the science that brought these things and lifestyles to us. It could have caused them to never have existed in a ways have to do the loss of such knowledge and the lack of respect for the science that brought these things in. Lifestyles to us could have caused them to have never existed in a way is that they do consider the gravity of the situation in the near future where things like robotics in genetic engineering and things of that nature become more serious threats and the public has no idea how they work.

Speaker 1:          06:57          This is already an issue in today's world. Number one, look again at that dot that's here. That's home. That's us on it. Everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of every human being who ever was lived out their lives. Carl Sagan said that astronomy was a humbling field of the many ways we view ourselves and our place in the grand scheme of things. One of the most profound was from the perspective of an image taken from around Saturn of the earth. The entire planet appears as an unimportant blue blemish in the blackness around it. Yet on that barely visible blue.is as he said, everything that we are, no human being has ever gone farther than a Tinier moon that orbits it. It truly puts into perspective the things that we do for power, fame, wealth, glory status, et Cetera. Even the greatest empires I've only ever controlled a fraction of a dot, which looks like it could just be rubbed off the picture.

Speaker 1:          07:52          Everyone with an interest in astronomy, marvels at how small we are, but this picture really drives that concept home. That's not to say that what we have on this tiny blue.is insignificant. However, as Carl Sagan also said, every one of us is an a cosmic perspective. Precious. If a human being disagrees with you, let him live in 100 billion galaxies, you will not find another. Even though this thought is small and seemingly fragile, the other hundreds of thousands of dots surrounding it may be completely barren. The fact that life seems so small and fragile from this perspective is all the more reason to cherish and defend it. Cross Sagan, of course, had a lot of other things to say, but these were some of his best quotes.
