Speaker 1:          00:00          Hello and welcome to fire of learning Niccolo Machiavelli's book. The prince was published in 1530 to five years after his death and in this video we're going to take a look at 10 very noteworthy tips from that book. As usual, I will attempt to deliver these points without personal bias. The book was written as a sort of advice guide for politicians, specifically kings of the time. Obviously this means taking literally, it isn't widely applicable as most of us aren't kings. Maybe you are, I don't, I don't know. But the advice is not applicable only for monarchs or even general politicians. It can be translated and utilized for a number of professions and situations from business to social life to whatever. So with that in mind, let's get started. Number 10 distrust, mercenaries and auxiliaries. Machiavelli believed that having soldiers who weren't loyal are dependent on you was a disastrous error.

Speaker 1:          00:49          These types of soldiers were only interested in their own gain or had loyalties to someone else. Accordingly, Machiavelli personally watched as the Italian states who use these types of soldiers consistently failed and strongly suggests raising troops of your own with a mutual goal. For example, the success of your kingdom. Number nine, you can't imitate great people exactly, but you should try as much as possible. Essentially, Machiavelli believed in learning from those who were successful in history. In fact, much of his advice is justified with examples all the way back to ancient civilizations within a given position. According to Machiavelli, you should attempt to imitate the habits of those who were successful. However, of course, at times it will unavoidably have to think and act on your own and these circumstances. Machiavelli advises that his best to not be reckless. Number eight, don't increase the power of rivals.

Speaker 1:          01:35          This seems obvious, but it's mistake far too often mate Machiavelli used the then recent failed invasion of Italy by the King of France as a consistent example throughout the book. Instead of assisting smaller states against the larger Italian nations, he allied himself with the pope and picked on smaller nations. The pope took control of this and seize more power for himself. Establishing his state as a dominant in the region. Further, the King of France made it even worse by allowing another rival and to the region. When Spain conquered Naples in Sicily, number seven, when conquering new people don't change too much. While it's certainly true that according to Margaret, one should take measures to ensure the loyalty of nearly obtained subjects. He claims that the best way to do this is to keep their laws taxes and such things mostly unchanged and less necessary. He even recommends allowing them to forming local government for their interests.

Speaker 1:          02:23          As long as the government is not hostile, but dependent on you. Number six, without power, opportunity is wasted. Without opportunity. Power is wasted. Machiavelli believe leadership was a combination of power and opportunity and not a wise leader could find ways to both. Furthermore, he warns against obtaining either with fortune, reminding us that he who depends on fortunate alone is a ruined when fortune changes depends upon yourself. Number five, we live so far removed from how we ought to live that he who abandons what is done for what ought to be done, we'll destroy himself rather than prevail. Machiavelli believed that morality, goodness, and kindness, we're all nice ideas. Realistically, one must do what they have to do to survive, succeed and grow. He cautions against trying to reform the system and encourages rather rising and succeeding in it as change can often be dangerous, especially if it is forced.

Speaker 1:          03:12          If you must change something though, do it with strength as armed profits conquer but unarmed ones fail. Number four, support from nobles and support from the people are two different areas in either group could ruin you. The nobility looks to achieve their own interests, namely by suppressing the people. The people in turn are interested, namely and not being suppressed and ability may threaten you to achieve their own interest and the people will often revolt if there are two headily pressed by you, in which case the people are usually a better ally to have for if you're hated by the people and the ability will easily remove you. But if you were loved by the people, the nobility will have a greater difficulty dethroning you. Number three, one must master the art of acting in the most efficient way, but looking as good of a person as possible.

Speaker 1:          03:53          Machiavelli says that a prince should attempt to look like someone who is merciful, faithful, respectable, humane, religious and generous, but behind the curtain may have to act in the exact opposite way to achieve results as a times. Adherence to these values may not only be disastrous, but it may come off as weakness and Machiavelli Warren's greatly against the ruler who looks timid, frivolous, a feminine, changeable or a resolute. The Art of politics, therefore, in his opinion, is mastering both the worlds. Number two, it is better to be feared than to be loved, but if possible, go for both. Machiavelli recognizes the importance of being favored by his subjects, but knows that too much leniency may invite trouble. Lean and sea bass out of love for the people may suggest a weakness that may provide opportunities for rivals and may decrease your power and therefore an element of fear is necessary in your ruling in treating others fails.

Speaker 1:          04:43          Using strength and force nearly always succeeds. And accordingly, if you have to choose between being loved and feared, it is better to go with being feared. And the number one point from the prince is at the end justifies the means. Machiavelli believed that to achieve efficient results, princess sometimes have to play a little bit dirty, playing dirty. In fact, playing very dirty is justifiable in his opinion, as long as the end result is something favorable and good. However, he adds onto this that if you're going to commit an atrocity, it's better to do it all in one day than to prolong it. I he would be better to execute a hundred people in one day than to kill one person each day over a hundred days while each perhaps warrants the same results. Technically, the former secures your position with fear and reassures rivals that you will act when crossed the ladder, gives the impression that you rule over people to radically in that further on security to people must oppose it to you. So these have been Machiavelli's top 10 tips from his very famous book, the Prince. It's certainly not as only advice though. I would highly recommend reading the book and for more videos like this and videos on many other subjects, I would invite you to check out fire of learning and subscribe. Thank you for watching.
