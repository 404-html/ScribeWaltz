Speaker 1:          00:00          Fire of learning presents the tale of out in from the West fjords. I'll don and his thoughts are vest fierce, go author on known, also known as out in the bear. There was a man named out and his family came from the West viewers and he had little money. He sailed abroad from the few words under the supervision of a good farmer named Thor Stein and the skipper authority or who have been staying with Torstein Stein that winter. I wouldn't had been living there too. Working for Thor Stein and exchange provisions and passage abroad, I would input most of what money. He had a wait for his mother before he boarded the ship. It was intended to pay for three years, food and lodging. They set sail. Their journey went well and out and spent the following winter with story or who owned a farm and more. The next summer they traveled to Greenland and spent the winter.

Speaker 1:          00:42          There it is, mentioned that out and bought a bear. They're a great treasure for which he traded everything he owned. The following summer they sailed back to Norway. They had a good voyage and out and had with him his bear. He planned the travel south to Denmark and meet King's fine and give him the animal and that when he arrived in the south of the country where the king was staying, he left the ship leading the bear behind him and rented a room. King Harold was soon told that a bear, a great treasure owned by an Icelandic man had arrived there. The king immediately sent to summon him and when out and appeared before the king, he greeted him. The king returned his greeting and asked, do you have a great treasure of a bear? He answered that. He did have a bear. The king asked, what do you, some of the animal for the same price.

Speaker 1:          01:21          You paid for it. He answered, I did not want you to do that, my Lord. What'd you then the king asked, let me give you double for what you paid for it. That would be fair if you have traded everything you own for it. I did not want to do that. My Lord, he answered the king as well. You give it to me. Then he answered, no, my lord making asked, what will you do with it? Then go, he answered to Denmark and give it to king's fine. King Harold said, are you so ignorant that you have not heard about the enmity between our countries or do you reckon you'd like so great that you can go with treasures where others cannot travel safely even though they do so of necessity out of answered my Lord, that is in your power, but I will not agree to do anything other than what I have intended.

Speaker 1:          01:58          The king then said, why not go ahead then and go your own way as you please, but come to see me when you return and tell me how king's fine has awarded you for the bear. It may well be that you were a fortunate man. I promised to do that set out and he then traveled south along the coast and east into Vic and from there onto Denmark, but then I'll have his travel money was spent and he was forced to beg for food false for himself and for the bear. He met a steward of the cane named Aki and asked him for provisions for himself and the bear I plan, he said to give the bare to king's fine. Aki told him that he would sell him provisions if you wanted, but out of reply that he had no money to pay for them, I want.

Speaker 1:          02:34          Nevertheless, he said to find a way to take the bear because a king, I will give you the provisions you need to reach the king. But in exchange I want to own half of the bear. You should consider the facts that the variable die. If you're not have the money for all the food you need, then you will not have any bear at all. And went out and had thought about what the Stuart had proposed. He found it reasonable. So they agreed that he would sell Aki half of the bear, and that's a king, should be the judge of the whole arrangements later. Now both of them were to go to see the king's together. So they went to see the king and stood before his table. The king pondered over who? This man whom he did not know might be he asked out and who are you?

Speaker 1:          03:09          He answered, I am an Icelandic man. My Lord and I have just come from Greenland and Norway. I wants to give you this bear. I gave everything I owned for it, but I have made a blunder for now. I only own half of the bear. He then told the king would have taken place between the Steward Aki and himself. The king asked is what? He says, True Aki. It is true. Aki replied, the King asked, did you think it appropriate given the fact that I've made you a powerful man to impede and hinder a man from bringing me a treasure that he's given all his possessions to buy? When King Harald thought it advisable to give him save conduct, even though he is our enemy. Now consider how fair this well on your part why you deserve to be killed. I'm not going to go that far, but you will leave the country immediately and never be caught in my eyesight again, but you out in.

Speaker 1:          03:53          I will think as if you had given me the entire beer and please do stay. He accepted that remained was king's fine for awhile. After some time had passed out and said to the king, I am now eager to leave here. My Lord, the king answered, has hesitatingly somewhat, where do you plan to go if you do not care to remain here with us? He applied. I want to make a pilgrimage to Rome. If your plan had not been so noble that king replied, your eagerness to leave here would have displeased me. The king then gave him a very great deal of silver and he traveled south with a group of pilgrims that came, made all the arrangements for his journey and asked him to come to see him when he returned out and then went his way until he arrived in Rome, when he had stayed there as long as he wished he had back, but on the way he felt terribly ill and lots of great deal of weight.

Speaker 1:          04:35          All of the money that king of given him for the journey was used up. So he was reduced to vagrancy and had to beg for food. He grew bald and was quite miserable. He arrived back in Denmark at Easter and went to where the king was staying because he did not dare show himself in public. He waited in a wing of the church and plants and meet the king as he walked into church that evening. But when he saw the king and his men all dressed up, he could not bring himself to appear before them. When the king went to feast in the hall out and was fed outside, as is the custom was Kellgren's while they still bear their staff and script. Now that evening when the king went to vespers out in plan to talk with them, but as much as he had hesitated before, he did so even more.

Speaker 1:          05:11          Now when the king's men were drunk, as they walked back inside the king, notice a man who seems not to have the courage to approach them. So when his men had got inside, the king turned and said, let him come forward. Now he who wishes to speak to me, I have a suspicion that you must be the man. Then Alan came forward and fell down with the king's feet with a king, scarcely recognize them. As soon as it king realized who he was though, he took out his hand and welcomed him. You have changed much. He said since we last met and he let them inside, not when the king's men saw him. They laughed at him, but the king said, you have no costs a laugh or he has a better provided for assault and you have the king then had a bath prepared for him and gave him clothing out and remains there with him.

Speaker 1:          05:50          It is told that sometime during the spring, the king invited out and to remain with him permanently and told him he would make him his cup there and honor him highly out and said, God reward. Do you my lord for all the honor you would bestow upon me. But as a matter of fact, I'm thinking of sailing to Iceland. The king replied, that seems an odd choice out and said, I cannot live with the fact that my Lord, that I am held in honor here with you. While my mother is a vagrant in Iceland for the provisions I left for her before I sailed from Iceland will now be exhausted. The king replied, that was well and nobody put, and you will turn out to be a fortunate man. That reason alone could make you're leaving here acceptable to me. Stay with me now until a ship has prepared.

Speaker 1:          06:28          And so he did one late spring day, king's fine walk downs, the docks. Remember preparing shifts to sail to various countries, to the Baltic and sax and eats to Sweden and Norway. He went out and came upon a beautiful ship that was being outfitted. The king asked, how do you like this ship out in? He answered very well. My Lord, the king said, I want to give you this ship as repayment for the bear out and thanked him for the ship as best he could. After a while when the ship was ready, King's fine said to Auten. Now you wish to leave and I am not going to hinder you, but I have heard that your country is poorly provided with harbors and that in many places there was only open coastline which is dangerous for ships. Now say you are shipwrecked and he lose you're shipping goods, then you will have little a show that you have met king's finding given him a treasure.

Speaker 1:          07:12          The king then gave him a leather pouch full of silver so that she won't be left entirely penniless. If you are a ship's racks, if you manage to hold onto this, it could still happen. The king continued it that you lose this too little good. Would it do then that you have met king spine and given him a treasure, the king's injury or ring off his arm and gave it to Adam and said, even if things turned out so badly that you were shipped right to any lose this money, you will not be painless if you make it ashore for many survive shipwrecks wearing gold and it will still be evident that you have met king's fine. If you hold onto the armoring, I would advise you though he said not to give the armoring away unless you feel you must repay a very great favor done to you by a noble man.

Speaker 1:          07:49          In that case, give that man the armoring four it would be fit men of high standing to accept it now farewell out and then set sail on a ride in Norway where he had his cargo carried to shore. This was a greater chore than it had been the last time he was in Norway. He then went to see king Harald to keep the promise he had made him before he sailed to Denmark. He greeted the king warmly. King Harald, return his greeting and said, sit down and drink with us, and so he did. King Harald then asked, how did king's Fund reward you for the bear out in replied by accepting the gift from me. That king said, why I would have done that. What else did he give you for it? I would in replied, he gave me silver so that I could make a pilgrimage.

Speaker 1:          08:27          Thinking Harold said kings fine gives many men's silver for pilgrimages and for other things, even when they did not bring him treasures. Now, what else did he give you? He offered out in reply to make me as cup bearer to bestow high honors upon me. A nice gesture said to king, but surely he gives you something more out in replied, he gave me a nor with goods, mostly highly desired here in Norway. Graciously done so they king and I would have rewarded you. Likewise, they give you anything else. I don't replied. He gave me another pouch full of silver and said that I will not be painless. Even if my shipper wrecked off the coast of Iceland, the king said splendid. Even I would not have done that. I would've considered myself free from obligation. After giving you the ship, did he give you anything else?

Speaker 1:          09:08          He did indeed. Give me more of my lord out. Instead, he gave me the armoring that I wear on my arm and told me that all my money could be lost. But that I still would not be painless, even if I have the ring. He told me not to give it to anyone else unless I felt obliged to repay a noble man so daily that I would be willing to part with it until I have now found that man, for you have the power to deprive me of both the bear ans my life hit you. Let me travel and piece to a place where others could not go. The king warmly accepted the gift and gave out and find gifts in return before they parted out instead of sight as money for the journey to Iceland and traveled there early that summer, he was considered an exceedingly fortunate man.
