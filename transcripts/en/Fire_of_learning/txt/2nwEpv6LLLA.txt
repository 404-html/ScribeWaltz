Speaker 1:          00:01          Hello and welcome to fire of learning. Ask yourself the question, what is life? If you ask what the philosopher and a scientist, they would probably give you two entirely different answers. A scientist would be able to go into detail about the biological intricacies of life on is talking about cells, DNA, the taxonomic classifications, survival, reproduction, evolution, all that sort of thing. A philosopher, however, would focus more on something like the human experience, the meaning behind existing. The questions we ask ourselves about existence and the guidelines we tend to employ to live our lives to the fullest and in fact what a fulfilling life really is. Given both of these answers and topics, which one is more important, the scientific example or the philosophical example? Well, in fact, one could argue that they are equally as important. However, this argument is not made nearly enough as it should be.

Speaker 1:          00:50          Many popular scientists of the day have to some degree, agreed upon the profound statement. Philosophy is dead. They are good at science has replaced a function of philosophy that the scientific method and empirical data has replaced sitting in a room thinking about the universe entirely in order to uncover its aspects and mysteries. Something like the origin of the universe for example, they claim has been taken from philosophy and is now in the field of science. In that regard, they are perhaps somewhat right, you know, the universe or the physical forces which shape the universe that we live in should be taken into science as much as possible. However, unfortunately the profound statement that philosophy is dead is profoundly wrong and for as respectable and knowledgeable as these scientists may be making these kinds of statements only demonstrates that they aren't as aware of the role of philosophy in our society and our individual lives as they should be.

Speaker 1:          01:44          Sure. I mean they are right and the argument that they make, it's true that in the past many great minds just assume they could sort of think of things and arrive to how it works and what it is, which today has been considerably replaced by science, but that's a shallow example up the great breadth of what philosophers did and still do. If philosophy is dead, then it's up to the scientist using only science to answer some very important questions. For example, explain scientifically, objectively, why is it wrong to kill? What is theft? What should I be doing with my life? Why shouldn't scientists be able to test medications or even weapons and such things on humans? Furthermore, science rest upon results, data the truth, but what does it mean for something to be true? You see, these are questions which are fundamental to our day to day lives, but it's not something to which you could just employ the scientific method to find out the answer.

Speaker 1:          02:41          So it's simply like you would something within the field of physics. It's not that simple. It's not so simple to try to employ empiricism to abstractions, which is what these people who are claiming philosophy to debt or doing what kind of government and economic systems should we have at this? The scientist may jump to respond. Oh, that's simple. We just take it every government and economic system we have, try it out in small test groups and see which one works the best and try to implement those policies into our modern society. True to logic and science. But what do you mean by the best? While the society, which is most efficient, but what does it mean to be an efficient society? Well, I suppose as a society in which people are the happiest, but why is happiness the most important thing for which we should strive in life?

Speaker 1:          03:28          What is happiness? What kind of happiness? The happiness of having a society which produces free endless candy bars for all its inhabitants or a deeper happiness of knowing one has lived a satisfying life. Who is happiness? The happiness of the average person. Does that mean that people above or below the average who may find happiness and other things have to suffer? To what degree do the needs of the many outweigh the few? So by this I s I hope you see of course how making such bland statements leads to a series of questions, which I hope reveals to you just how deeply philosophy takes things. A depth, which I worry that many people, especially these people making these statements that philosophy is dead, aren't even aware of, let alone appreciate an offensive scientists my grow angry at all these questions and ask, well, when's the last time a philosopher ever got us to the moon or cure a disease?

Speaker 1:          04:14          Good point. I'm not trying to degrade the role of science here at all. Those achievements were largely made directly by scientists, philosophers, however, indirectly questions and thoughts and ideas and morals and ideologies were floating around. That even led to things like that happening. We asked, how can we get to the moon, but we also asked, why should we go to the moon? Why do we explore? What does it all mean? Things that a philosopher would ask, and it's important to keep in mind here. That motivation to go to the moon is as important as technology to get their face with something like colonizing the moon and Mars philosopher has to ask the same questions, which may lead to scientists to say, just shut up, dude is freaking cool. Okay, that's why we're doing it for the philosopher has a point look at how we've destroyed our own planet, for example, as human society, a good thing which we should, which we should spread to other planets and moons only to pollute and destroy them too.

Speaker 1:          05:07          And why should we cure diseases? That's sound like a dumb question to ask, but it's still one which has to be answered. Jonas Salk that didn't have polio and furthermore, he didn't even patent his vaccine. Why did he even bother? What do we owe the world and why? These other kinds of questions, again addressed by philosophy. Scientists who are critical of philosophy go at least five times as hard on religion, and I don't mean to take a position for or against religion. That's not the purpose of this channel. Maybe some channels like to slip their personal biases into that, but not this one. But I will say that many of these big scientists are factually atheists or agnostics or some variant of that and without God or gods or some source for objective morality, which is, you know, instructions from a higher power on how to live.

Speaker 1:          05:52          Basically philosophy becomes even more important. As soon as you decide you're an atheist, an agnostic or something like that, which is by the way, a position guided by whether you know, not whether you know it or not, philosophy, you're suddenly hit in the face with some huge questions about what it is to well, to even exist. Really an atheist is all of a sudden faced with nihilism, faced with the belief that nothing matters. What does that mean? Does that mean it's okay to do anything, shoot people steal, burn down a house, et Cetera? Most atheists would say, no, that's still wrong, but we're a Christian or Muslim or Hindu or something like that would justify it being wrong based off their belief that their dad say it is wrong. The atheist has to go deeper and that is done through it philosophy. So again, when a scientist is analyzing bacteria and the lab doing something which he or she may claim is purely biological, purely scientific, they may feel comfortable saying something like philosophy is dead, but there isn't much time to study bacteria in a society which is convinced that we should live in a dictatorship in which we worship ants and slave people with green eyes and avoid technology because of the harm it brings because we have abandoned philosophy.

Speaker 1:          07:00          That is another very important argument to consider. By the way, what if science and technology leads to what's being unhappy should be continued to pursue it in this society? You'd probably be pretty unhappy. Your lab was destroyed by soldiers. Your job as a microbiologist is now illegal. You live under a dictator now and if you have green eyes, you're a slave. You might protest. This is against their rights, but the dictator would laugh. What rights? The right to free speech, the right to live freely, essentially human rights. He makes you a deal. If you can prove that these rights exist unless you go, unfortunately for you, you may be spending some time in slavery, used to be value our rights and exercise them on a daily basis. Even if we don't think about them. For many of us, they are intrinsic to who we are, but they can't scientifically be proven to exist and therefore they can be easily stripped from you.

Speaker 1:          07:52          Rights exists because a handful of intelligent people I eat, philosophers decided that they should, and the common person then agreed to mutually respect and uphold them beyond that. Places for people who abuse these rights called prisons were created in order to uphold them. So again, we come to these big important questions. What is life all about? How should I live mine? How should we build society? What role do I have insights society and why, et Cetera, et cetera. Philosophers give a wide range of answers, some argue that we should dedicate ourselves to upholding the greatest society at all costs. Sort of that the whole is more than the sum of its parts. Some are less collectivist, but still argue that by being born into society, be signed. His social contract in which we agreed to follow laws and participate respectfully, that we have a duty to society.

Speaker 1:          08:38          Some say that's nonsense and the rules of society change with who is in it and that we shouldn't force people to participate in it in voluntarily. Some say we should vote on decisions. Other people say the average person is too dumb to vote. We need strong authority figures and make decisions for us. Some say taxes are justified in that day can be utilized to improve our society. Others say Tech Station has stepped. Some say owning something like land but they don't use is justifiable. Others say the property's theft. Some say we should focus on maximizing our own existence over coming barriers to live the best life we possibly can. Some would say that society comes second to the individual and that we should delve as society as a union of self interested people who aren't subservience to ideologies or abstractions. Some say happiness is the ultimate golf for which people should strive to get of life and of these there are thousand interpretations of what happiness is and how we should go about achieving it.

Speaker 1:          09:28          Some, however, would argue against something like hedonism. You could go on for days exploring these questions. Well actually humans have gone on for thousands of years asking these questions and we still don't have definite answers that everybody seems to agree on. Some I concluding point here to anyone who has followed what's called scientism. The belief that philosophy is dead and the science can take over and answer all questions is that the very existence of science rest upon foundations made by philosophy. Empiricism rests on philosophical argumentation for us effectiveness. The argument that we should employ science to improve our lives is a philosophical debate. The very societies that we have created, which allows science to even exist in all its modern glory are dependent upon philosophical arguments for the existence of such things. So no philosophy is not dead. It's alive and arguably better than ever. Science is not a separate process from philosophy.

Speaker 1:          10:20          They are very closely intertwined. To the point where I would say that anyone who calls himself a scientist, anyone who claims to wake up in the morning with a desire to understand the world, needs to give some consideration to philosophy. Even if you're not a scientist, anyone who seeks to live a fulfilling life should give some time and thought to philosophy because as Socrates tells us, the unexamined life is not worth living.
