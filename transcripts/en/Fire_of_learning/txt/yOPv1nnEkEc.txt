Speaker 1:          00:13          [inaudible] [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          00:18          the French revolution does not only a major event in French history, but world history. It's occurrence for a democratic ideals and reform across the entire Globe and paved the way for the empire of Napoleon, which all had a profound impact on world history. But what if it never happened to start? We must look at wine Eventide and before we can discuss an alternate history, of course, it is truly impossible to predict the changes that would come today and tunic a major event from such a long time ago as first in a world where little changes can have a big impact. But we will use history and reasoning to come up with an appropriate scenario. The French revolution happened for multiple reasons, democratic ideals and philosophy. We're building up in 18th century, Europe and France, like barrels of gunpowder. All it took was a spark to change everything.

Speaker 2:          01:06          And this spark was Francis failed economy and it's harsh winter at the time, well, let's say King Louis the 16th was able to turn all this around and this scenario, he fixes the economy. The peasants are friends or less angered democratic ideals. And not gain as much ground first and foremost, part of Louis the 16th ever to stabilize the economy of all familiar methods and our own timeline deploy in reclaiming Louisiana from Spain to sell to the United States in order to acquire funds for his army and our own bizarre timeline. Louie the 16th that's the same thing. France maintains possession of Heidi, however, maintain slavery there until there a billion occurs face with total loss of the colony, Louie the 16th the sides. It would be beneficial to abolish slavery in the colonies just as England will do soon and early 19th century Europe without the French revolution.

Speaker 2:          01:57          The continent is better with each other. France and England are still in constant competition. England is still bitter with France for assessing the American revolutionaries and Francis bitter about their losses in the Americas. In fact, all of Europe is still dissatisfied with the seven years war and their conflicts which came after and our own timeline just before the French revolution began. Prussia and Austria, we're squaring up for war, so there are alliances badly weakened. Austrian friends seeing the thread began to reconstruct their alliance along with Russia, Spain in Denmark. Meanwhile, pressure of Britain in Portugal perform their alliance this time taking up with the Ottoman Empire in Sweden as Britain threatens the United States, France attempts to convince the Americans to join them. At first President Thomas Jefferson declines wanting America through remain isolationists. Eventually though the United States is forced to declare war on Britain to the British harassment, encouragement of native American raids and for various other reasons.

Speaker 2:          02:57          Thus begins the war of Oh six Americans facing the blunt of the British army ally themselves with France, but France alone plus the French soon join the fight, which prompts Europe to join the fight as well. The war of 1806 becomes international and North America conflict explodes. The French and Americans fight the British everywhere, but France predominantly leads a campaign in Canada, encouraged by the conflict that people of Quebec rise up to aid the French through this work came back, becomes an independent nation. In Europe, the French aren't doing as well. Pressure is generally the feeding author with Ottoman support. The feeding Russia was Swedish support and stay on meeting with friends. Can you let me know? Is that of Denmark and breaks Sweden. Russia will be free to focus on pressure and naval battle erupts there. Denmark, France and Denmark fighting the British and the Swedish French are victorious.

Speaker 2:          03:51          Sweden is invaded in forced to surrender France, Austria and Russia. Java campaign and the pressure feeding them. Britain is eventually forced to surrender after this 10 year conflict as well. Over the next century, Britain maintainance colonies in India, the British Canada had been badly wounded with liberation of Quebec. Pressure on its ally. German state struggled to recover. Russia and Austria divide much of the Polish territory and former Prussian lands colonies develop much as I did in our timeline in Africa and Asia. But in the 1860 [inaudible] a long wave of liberalism sweeps through Europe. Poland declares its independence from Russia and Prussia supports it. They are largely successful in Poland, becomes an independent nation as Austria and France struggled with liberalism. Countries like Serbia try to rise up from Austria, but only the Serbian succeed. In doing so, France nearly engaged in civil war or a kind of French revolution chooses instead to become a constitutional monarchy.

Speaker 2:          04:48          And this timeline, communism is invented, though it's not as accepted in a Europe that has barely experienced basic democracy in the 20th century war breaks out, pressure is concerned with an ambitious goal uniting all the Germanic lands. It joins forces with Poland to companies lands, France, Austria and Russia join the other side. Britain joins pressure as well and this time they are victorious. The Austrian Empire has hit the hardest losing much of its land. It's the pressure others to Poland and the rest breaking up into other independent states such as Hungary. Frances is some of its land, the pressure and a nation known as Germany comes to power in the 1930s and nationalism give voice to a new conflict. World War One this time though, Germany seeks to conquer all of Europe sparked by nationalism. France, Britain and Russia join against them. Germany and Poland joined forces and absorb much of the old Austrian lands. Russia pulls out of the war is a mess and chaos breaks out leading to the formation of the Russian republic and seeds, much of its lands at the NME alliance.

Speaker 2:          05:55          Eventually though Britain and France are victorious against the Germans and the Polish are nations are reduced to smaller sides, as in many other nations are formed from their ashes, the republics and constitutional monarchies. There conflict still occurred. No cold wars happened. This timeline, the atomic bomb was invented, but it never actually used in combat. The French and the British empire continuance to 1960s until it's social reform and revolution calls for their ends. United States remains a largely isolation as nation expanding its own territories and eventually is engaged in its separate conflict with Japan over the Pacific. This could be a map of the year 2015 in which the French revolution never occurred. The world's superpowers or Britain, France, Russia, America, and Japan. Because the Japanese American war took place before the invention of the atomic bomb. Japan was largely defeated, but never successfully invaded though was colonial possessions were gradually lost over time. France remains a constitutional monarchy over time. Eventually people are given more power in the government. Slick, modern England. Today, Russia as a republic, Japan is one of the lowest absolute monarchies in the world. America is very strongly. Isolation is the European Union may occur in this timeline as well as United Nations. Well, many conflicts which were resolved in our timeline did not truly recover by the year 2015 in this timeline.

Speaker 3:          07:27          Okay.

Speaker 2:          07:27          Also, in the 1970s the Americans, British, French, Russians, Japanese, each land a man on the moon as a kind of space race occurs.
