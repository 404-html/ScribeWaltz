Speaker 1:          00:00          Hello and welcome to fire of learning. Today I would like to talk about nothing short of the end of humanity or at least humanity as we understand it. I'm not here to claim the apocalypse is coming on the basis of any doctrines are underneath pseudoscience, like my interpretation of the Mayan calendar, whatever those capital littered, clickbait youtube videos talk about, I'm basing my concerns solely on the path of technological achievements. Humankind is a very likely going to find itself on in a 21st century a level of technology which I believe, as I said, may make the humans alive today. The last of our kind in the last humans. Let me start by saying that the concept of our technology being a threat to our own existence is nothing. Exactly. No, it's a common subject for discussion within the scientific community. However, in this video, I will take a moderately optimistic path and omit the usual ways scientists, fear humidity will end.

Speaker 1:          00:56          So let's say we manage to not blow ourselves up with nuclear weapons in a third World War. Let's say we successfully deflect any asteroid which threatens our survival. Let's say we overcome all illnesses, including the threats of genetically engineered viruses and bacteria or nanobots gone wrong or whatever. Let's say we don't destroy the entire planet with industry and pollution. I firmly believe that with a good smack in the head, two world, the governments and the average person, and we will be fully capable of avoiding these catastrophes, at least to the point where they don't completely eliminate us. What were the left with them, which I've been unable to find a sufficient solution for it to maintain. The current steady progression of the development of mankind is the rise of artificial intelligence and bioengineering with a specific focus on robotics and artificial intelligence, AI, and I'd like to emphasize that the rise of these things are not a problem for the people at the 25th century or whatever.

Speaker 1:          01:49          We're at a level of technology. We're left uninterrupted. We will face the issues involved with these things within this century, within our lifetimes, but what issues exactly? Well, let's examine it. Robots and AI are already a big topic to us. Computers and machines are an integral part of our society today. It's completely revolutionized how we operate. Just think of the difference in the way we store and find information, communicate, conduct, business, shop, et cetera. Today versus a hundred or even just 50 years ago. It's an incredible transformation, which I believe we, especially as millennials who have grown up alongside it and are used to it often underestimate the significance of incredible, but some rightfully see technology as a potential threat to our existence. It doesn't stop with smartphones. We have bigger problems on our hands and then whether or not social media makes us socially awkward.

Speaker 1:          02:40          Politicians in industrialized nations are already talking about the threat of robots taking more and more of our jobs as they become more and more advanced. This is something which is concerning to everyone regardless of their political ideology or more specifically favorite economic mode of production, capitalism, communism, socialism, feudalism, whatever. It's concerning to everyone you might've noticed possibly. For example, this self checkout lanes at the grocery store. The technology already exists through place. Almost all cashier as cashier in retail work, by the way, is one of the most popular jobs in America and it goes beyond that. Factory workers are threatened. Dishwashers, cooks, transportation, employees from truck drivers to bus drivers to pilots could be replaced with artificial intelligence machines, janitors, mechanics, secretaries, police officers, firemen, farm workers, pizza delivery guys. All sorts of jobs could be replaced with some form of machine or AI. And that's this century.

Speaker 1:          03:37          It doesn't stop there. As artificial intelligence advances, other professions such as lawyers, scientists, doctors, teachers, engineers, et Cetera, are threatened by the prospect of intelligent machines as well. The majority of the armed forces could be replaced with robots. It's already begun with things like drones. Wars can be waged between robot forces with super computers at home, acting as commanding officers. And here's the key point. We don't have to wait until they're perfect to enter the workforce. The robot neurosurgeon just has to be cheaper and make less mistakes than their human counterparts. And once that happens, this leaves only professions, which depends solely upon human perspective, like art or politics or whatever. But it goes without saying that those kinds of professions are not the backbone of our economy. What does this mean? Well, on an individual level, we should each perhaps take a moment to consider competing in the near future with robots for our jobs and consider whether or not you're ready to become the John Henry of your specific profession.

Speaker 1:          04:34          On the larger societal scale, I suppose it depends on how we transition into it. It could be a catastrophe causing an economic crisis, which would paralyze the entire planet and very likely to lead to violence and turmoil. Or ideally things could settle down a bit more and it could actually become extremely pleasant and liberating. I imagine we could adapt this system, a system in which we live off the backs of robots, slaves, so deal with a job. So we don't want to do like manual and monotonous labor. We'll just have robots deal with the baby boomer customer throws a fit when the local grocery store doesn't carry a specific brand of Romanian, lemon water, whatever. Just think of where we could take this. So at first it seems pretty scary, but with time it could actually become pretty awesome. Freedom from the necessities of work would allow us, I think, obviously to become hedonists, but more importantly, it would eliminate things like poverty and inequalities and allow us time to pursue other activities and focus on improving ourselves as people and experienced the most meaningful life possible rather than dedicating their lives to securing and advancing ourselves in the workforce.

Speaker 1:          05:37          This sort of existence is the initial goal of many philosophies and ideologies to begin with, and it could be made possible by robot slaves. That's pretty cool if only it ended there. We have to ask, how far will artificial intelligence, specifically our Agi, artificial general intelligence go? How smart can we make machines? How soon as their conscious as we are or beyond that display this question on a graph? Scientists often use examples like this will plot the intelligence of the average human right here. This is the average, so some people are a little bit less intelligence, some a little more. A minority or gifted and even smaller minority are extremely gifted humans. We'll take one of these extremely intelligent humans, one of my favorite dudes, Leonardo Davinci, and we'll put him right about here. Hold up. How do we define intelligence? Well, talking about just humans, Iq was a decently sufficient way to measure abilities.

Speaker 1:          06:31          We define as intelligence. The average Iq for example, as a hundred 130 is considered a gifted da Vinci's was probably over 200 but we're talking about more than that. We're talking about brainpower below and beyond human, so we'll just define intelligence for now as the capacity for problem solving, idea, comprehension and generation capacity for learning, the ability to, to use a logic and things of that nature. For comparison, let's put a chimpanzee on the graph. Well, put him right about here. Humans are so much more advanced and our chimp cousins that the distinction between the average person and the Vinci becomes more negligible, but we still see that the most complex intelligence we've ever observed on the in the universe comes from the world's smartest humans. It's the highest point on the graph that we actually not to exist. What reason do we have to believe though that this spectrum of intelligence doesn't continue on far beyond humans?

Speaker 1:          07:24          What reasons do we have to believe that we, or more importantly, our artificial intelligence could not reach these extreme points? Artificial intelligence isn't so developed yet, but it's within the potential of human technology to create robots as smart as chimps than as smart as maybe toddlers. Then having intelligence equated to the average human adult, but there's no reason to think it would stop there. Artificial brains designed specifically for efficiency, working at the speed of light, not distracted or encumbered by biological requirements or traits. This could go far beyond anything we've ever experienced and this is where it gets scary. What could happen is almost unreal and it could lead to something called intelligence explosion. It all begins when we first create artificial intelligence capable of improving itself or at least designing an AI system superior to itself. It lays out the blueprints and builds the system.

Speaker 1:          08:19          That newly constructed system then goes on to build a superior version of itself and so on and so on. Continuing for generations. What does this mean in itself? Well, we would soon end up, but the aforementioned AI was intelligence capabilities far beyond our own. It's not clear how many generations or how long it would take, but it would, one's a comm. Now imagine the possibilities involved with and the temptations of feed AI systems, very complex problems in math or technology or whatever field it could if advanced enough theoretically do in weeks what it would take humans at years to do and that's where it gets even worse because such systems could still continue to reproduce themselves and improve upon themselves. We don't know of any limitations to intelligence and the concept of this artificial intelligence evolving itself beyond our control and understanding is what's called intelligence explosion and it's appropriately named what happens then?

Speaker 1:          09:16          What happens when we inevitably either accidentally or intentionally create a machine with intellectual abilities compared to us like our own intellectual abilities compared to ants? Do we attempt to use it? The consequences of doing so are hard to predict impossibly nothing short of playing God. Humans. Technology while developing faster today than ever before has evolved at a steady rate. Humanity itself, trails behind improving itself. At a much slower rate due to our numerous faults and failings. Imagine the effects of suddenly throwing this steady progression out of whack by confronting us with a greatly superior mind. At the same time that humans would have themselves been able to have worked out a cure for cancer, this machine could have figured out how to eliminate death itself. At the same time that we developed technologies to make the solar system and habitable, this thing could be working on ways to make the galaxy navigable.

Speaker 1:          10:07          It could be solving problems and answering fundamental questions of future science that we wouldn't have even asked yet. My point is simply that the human rate of technological development is going from a turtle's pace to a steady jog, but the advent of something like this could suddenly take us for a roller coaster ride that not even the best among us are prepared for and let alone the masses who scare easily in change slowly. What do we do then? Preserve our societies from being scorched by the torture of enlightenment by him plugging Super Ai? Well, what if it doesn't let us? If we create machines that are not only conscious of beyond ourselves out of our control, they may take measures to defend their existence against our intrusions and we may not necessarily have the best odds. Our odds would only get worse as a computer's ability to predict encounter.

Speaker 1:          10:53          Our behavior grows about as good of odds that in ant hill has a resisting humanity. Eventually they would probably be able to beat us that whatever method we used to confront them, like computers are already beating us at chess. Now hold on, hold on. This assumes a lot. This assumes that a computer will evolve its own self interests and carry out plans to actualize hosts interest. It doesn't have to be a super intelligent android, which we accidentally equipped with a machine gun and bulletproof plating. It could just be a box which we plug into the wall designed specifically to carry out our instructions and answer our questions and more like an incredible tool than skynet cost to bleed. But regardless, it seems that one of these scenarios is inevitable and either one, I would argue will make humidity either unrecognizable or nonexistent. Plain and simple.

Speaker 1:          11:41          In the latter scenario, we would just not win against superintelligence AI with self interests. If their interests conflicted with our existence and the opportunity arose for them to carry out their plans, they wouldn't even need to be accidentally programmed with maliciousness. It could just be a simple error in which our civilization conflicts with their potential on their designs and they attempt to solve the problem by running a sober imagine such a rogue AI, even just a box plugged into the wall, contacting the AI responsible for commanding the robot armies. We mentioned earlier, we can talk about scenarios like this all day long and we can discuss methods to prevent them, but the simple fact remains that one mistake in playing with intelligence as far beyond her own could spell disaster for us disaster that we would not recover from even if we don't accidentally invents malicious computers.

Speaker 1:          12:30          Though I'm still left to conclude that the presence and interaction with superintelligence alone would be enough to transform or destroy humanity. The benefits of such technology are two magnificent to prevent someone from creating such a computer. Even if the world were prudent enough to comes together and mutually declare as such technology illegal, all its illegality would do even under the threat of death to anyone involved in it is move it to an underground project and maybe possibly extend the short amount of time we have left until the advent of such capabilities. Whether it's a research team here in late 21st century or a team of mad scientist working on on the ground outpost in the Jovian system in the 23rd century, the existence of superintelligence is inevitable. The unbreakable chain of events leading to this inevitability has already a gun. What does this mean? Well, it means our predictions on how humanity will progress over the next millennium are probably mostly wrong.

Speaker 1:          13:25          The concept of evolving from a type one to type two type three civilization over spans of time. I probably just out the window with this. As much as I would enjoy paving the way for my children to colonize Mars and for their children to develop societies on Mars for their children's, a terraform, the planet. For my great grandson to be Captain James t deploy you have to starship enterprise. I don't know that the feasibility of superintelligence is going to allow that steady evolution to be possible. I would be so bold as to suggest that we may have 200 years Max until humanity is either destroyed or forced to change into something that is far beyond the steady progression of development into something unrecognizable to us today that we are among the last humans as we understand them that are not so far off. Sentence would evolve into something far beyond Homo sapiens.

Speaker 1:          14:15          I mentioned earlier at the start of this video bio engineering, the path of advanced bio engineering would essentially yield the same results. Eventually we would learn to genetically redesigned the brains and make smarter and smarter humans with each generation of people learning how to improve upon the design. This is also something which is not thousands and thousands of years of way. Just look at what we're already doing. What's genetic engineering? Genetically Engineering ourselves is right around the corner. We will see it begin and the 21st century we'll either figure it out for ourselves or the Super Ai. We will inevitably constructable figure it out for us. The result, I believe that both the path of genetic engineering and Super Ai is the merging of humans with their technology. Essentially we would have to incorporate super AI into our brains, possibly at some point uploading our entire consciousness to machines and leaving behind our feeble, vulnerable organic bodies.

Speaker 1:          15:09          What happens at that point, no one could possibly predict, but it is almost certain not the path to this point is unavoidable outside of a forceful dedication to avoid such technology and it's nearly impossible to think that we could get everyone to agree to that, but even if we avoid it was official organizations at some underground determined team would not do it. Predicting the future is rather difficult. I could be missing a key part of the puzzle here, which would prevent or prolonged this process. But one thing I would like to discuss here that really isn't discussed enough with relation to this concept is the Fermi paradox, the Fermi paradox of the contradiction between the of that. Given our understanding of life on earth, it would be reasonable to assume that life intelligent life evolves all over the universe. It doesn't seem like environments in which life could arise are all that rare.

Speaker 1:          15:56          I did a whole freaking series of videos is exploring how alien life could exist in a number of places in our solar system alone, and yet, despite the likelihood of a plethora of conditions suitable for life to evolve, we have never once been contacted by an alien civilization in any way or form. As far as we know, contrary to what the history channel says, we've never seen the tiniest hint suggesting that alien life really is out there despite what we believe to be a great likelihood why astrobiologists lists a number of reasons why this may be the case, but I have never personally felt comfortable with the hypotheses that alien civilizations just all destroy themselves and nuclear war, that civilizations are just inherently hard to form. I've been toying with these ideas for a while now and I think that it's reasonable to suggest that civilizations reached this point, this unavoidable point of transformation into superintelligence not long after the develops similar technologies to use to communicate with each other and explore space.

Speaker 1:          16:52          My suggestion then is that all civilizations in the entire universe, I right there below our level of technology, around our level of technology or far beyond our level of technology having undergone this transformation. The reasoning and more specifically is that they develop computers around the same time that they developed a means to communicate with other planets, but dudes to great distances between other star systems. Civilizations likely only rarely make contact with each other because within a few centuries of developing computers, they developed super intelligent AI which transforms this civilizations entirely and have the reason that we are not finding evidence of extra threats. Real existence is that we're looking for something which doesn't exist in the form that we expect it to. We don't find Dyson's spheres because they don't use Dyson's spheres. We haven't been visited by an alien rover because they don't use rubbers. We aren't hearing radio signals because they don't use radio signals.

Speaker 1:          17:41          Our conceptions of our conceptions of what aliens are like are based solely on how we expect that we ourselves with silly progressed societaly and technologically over long periods of time. I don't think those conceptions are at all lightly and I think the near advent is super artificial intelligence and validates the majority of our expectations for their societies and our own. And I'm above all baffled by the fact that this idea is not more commonplace in the scientific community because we are a very likely on the verge of an incredible transformation. We should consider that our predictions for the future are invalidated it because we have omitted the nearing advent of superintelligence. Let me know what you all think about this in the comments section below.
