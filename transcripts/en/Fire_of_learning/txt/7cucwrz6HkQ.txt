Speaker 1:          00:00          Hello and welcome to fire learning. So at the beginning of this series we talked about what started the Viking age. And after that we talked about in the last video we talked about the Viking age itself. Oh, it's so far. We've only talked about the Vikings as Raiders warriors and conquerors. And if we're going to talk about the vikings, we have to talk about them as settlers and colonists as well. The vikings very quickly developed a mastery of navigation. I had really not been seen in Europe prior to this time, and this led them to go on and not only settle this and lands such as the Faroe Islands and Iceland, but furthermore to go where no European nation had gone before, to Greenland and into North America. And in this video, we're going to talk about that. So firstly, the Norris arrived in and began to settle the 18 Faroe islands located here west of Scandinavia, northern Scotland.

Speaker 1:          00:43          Remember, of course that didn't, Norris had already settled the Scottish islands around 800 a d so not long after the Viking age officially began, just seven years. In fact, the word for it comes from Freud are the old and the worst word for sheep. They were likely not the first inhabitants. There's a good deal of evidence that Celtic people's or perhaps other Scandinavians predating his era had attempted settlement here, but the Viking influence in colonies on these islands is what would last at the modern day. As I hinted towards a lot of evidence indicates that a lot of these settlers came from the north colonies and the British isles and such in DNA research on the moderate and how it ends throws a mix of both Norris and Celtic ancestry. Later though many Norwegians also came to the islands for a number of reasons likely to escape corrupted rural at home, they founded a number of settlements including tore shop in which still exists as the capitol of the islands.

Speaker 1:          01:33          To this day, many inhabitants here believes that the log team, which is a kind of Congress or problem, it is the oldest still running in the world. Large team or look ting as it seems looks a lot like law thing, which is exactly what it means. Kind of similar to how the word republic comes from the Latin race public, meaning that public thing. This reiterates that the vikings were somewhat democratic around the same time as a settlement of the Faroe Islands of Vikings ran into nearby Iceland. I did a video on ice and already, but I think will improve here on the scratchy audio in poor presentation skills of my earlier fiber learning days. So settlement of Iceland's began around 870 [inaudible] though much like the Faroe Islands, other people specifically the Celts had been here slightly earlier than a Norse. However, Iceland at this time was for the most part on inhabited and the Norris with their livestock and farming interests.

Speaker 1:          02:22          We're very interested in available land according to the legend of Viking from Norway names and the daughter was the first viking to land on Iceland. He called the island is snail land, land to snow later on, a viking name thrown off from the flow, keep vulgar. Darson set up with his crew to voyage to Iceland. He brought with him three birds from the Faroe Islands, one of which when released began to fly toward Iceland and they follow it to find the island. They stayed for a considerable amount of time though after having great trouble finding food. And after a hard winter killed all of flunkies cattle. He grew angry and exhausted in called the island Iceland out of spite. So it's important to note that many of these north and and just put everything to ship one day and see, I'll tell land that they knew nothing about it.

Speaker 1:          03:02          So the majority of the first settlements in a lot of these places, not just ISS, began only as temporary outposts. According to Viking accounts, the first long term settlers were men under angle for our nurses and eight 74 armerson settle in a place they called Reiki Arvik, meaning the smokey cove, Reykjavik to this day remains the capital city of Iceland. I considerable number of people followed him perhaps during the age of settlement up to 20,000 people settled. Iceland's the age last a little bit less than 80 years. Iceland while being a fascinating place is appropriately named. It doesn't have much fertile land, and by the early 10th century, the available land on the island had been mostly occupied, much like the Faroe Islands. Many settlers were from the north colonies and the British isles. And in later Norwegians fleeing the rule of King Harald Fair Norseman very likely discovered Greenland northwest of Iceland, accidentally North's accounts state to gum Bjorn Oates and was sailing to Iceland, had been blown off course heavily by a storm.

Speaker 1:          03:59          When he recovered, he noticed a number of islands off the coast of what is now known as Greenland. And accordingly, he is credited with discovery of it also. Accordingly, a number of places in Greenland to this day are named after him in the late 10th century of famous Vikki, known as Eric Thor vaults, and better known as Erik. The red after the color of his hair was banished from Norway for committing manslaughter. He then moved to Iceland where he was banished again for three years for committing murder. Now, Iceland was a little bit more peaceful than the typical north settlement, but imagine being too violent for the vikings. According to legend, during his banishment, he sailed north alone to a mysterious island about which very little was known. He found it and explored it, claiming many parts as his own. After his banishment had ended, he returned to Iceland to tell the locals of this place.

Speaker 1:          04:43          He called the place Greenland. The places he discovered certainly were habitable and indeed the climate was warmer than it is today. Greenland is probably the least green of all the northern colonies. Obviously this was false advertisement directed towards the north of Iceland, the particularly those who had settled pour in disagree of land in the year 985 a great number of north set sail for the colony on Greenland. The Norris per usual preferred to settle near fewer words, which are inlets of water located between two clips. Such settlements included [inaudible] founded by Eric, which meant the steep slope. Greenland became thus medieval Europe's far this frontier and being a part of North America. One could argue that these were the first European settlements in North America. Regardless of that argument, however, the north was soon make their way to the North American mainland. The vikings were not the first to settle Greenland though either.

Speaker 1:          05:34          They may very well have been the first of Europeans, but a number of inhabitants from North America to called the doorstep. People had already been living on the island as well. However, interaction between the people indigenous to the area and the north settlers did not take off until the 13th century. However, eventually mysteriously the Greenlanders and the people of their homelands lost contact with each other much later on in history and in 1721 Danish or Norwegian explorers found no European descendants on the island. We'll discuss what happens later on in the series during the voyage degree in Linden nine 85 one of the shifts is blown off course and as is consistent with Viking history being blown off course from time to time, tennis a lead you to a magnificent discovery, Vr, any hair you offs and reported finding lands west of Greenland being very focused on returning to Greenland.

Speaker 1:          06:21          He did not go out to explore the land from south, but he did tell Eric the Red Sun Life Erickson about it. Life is described as a tall, strong and capable individual and was a worthy heir to his father. Life wanted his father to lead an expedition. The lands west of Greenland and his father reluctantly agreed, but Eric was injured in preparing for it. He fell off his horse on his way to the ship and told life, I am not meant to discover any more lands besides this fun. This was seen as an omen, but life persisted and he led an expedition himself. The vikings weren't exactly surprised at the idea that there would be more lands to the west. Keep in mind, even the maps, they had a blends already known to them were of poor quality. They certainly weren't going to have detailed maps of what had been poorly explored.

Speaker 1:          07:04          If you look at their maps and examine how they believe the world loved at the time and they believe that the, that west of the old world, there was a ring of lands which, which sort of circle back around to Africa and that they were simply discovering the these rings, this ring of lands. The discovery of North America happened toward the ends of the Viking age. One events symbolizing it's near end, was the spread of Christianity. By this time, many vikings, including life, had converted to Christianity. He'd life had been largely responsible. In fact, for spreading the religion to Greenland. He was asked by the King of Norway to bring a priest to a settlement with him. However, his father, Eric, did manage to hold onto his pagan ways, as did a number of other vikings who felt threatened by the new religion, so life and his expedition set out sailing to the lands west of Greenland.

Speaker 1:          07:50          Soon came to a land which he called to Lou land, which many people believe today is Baffin Island and island north of Canada. He found the land in hospitable and he moved on. He came to a place he called and mark land of forested area, which was very likely modern Labrador trees, by the way, were considerable interest to the vikings due to the short supply of them in places like Iceland and especially Greenland and the necessity of them in many aspects of biking ways of life must specifically shipbuilding later on, Europeans would use North American what to build their ships as well. He continued to say all, but he realized that winter was coming. Life decided to camp and a place south of mark land, which he called [inaudible] Finland according to the sagas life claim that wild grapes and wheat grew all across the land and no, it'll be vin Lind means wine land or even grape land where they're really wild grapes here.

Speaker 1:          08:37          Well, possibly there were grapes for the down south, which they may have gotten a hold of, but much like Greenland, it might've been a little bit of a misleading name. In order to attract settlers. Think of how attractive wild wheat and grapes sounds to destitute farmers in Greenland. As I said, life set up base in Vineland directing half of the expedition to stay at base and the other half to keep exploring. It was somewhere during this voyage where in the Vikings and counter people they called it this Grayling's and native Americans. The names scrolling tells people all about what the black in relationship with the natives was like. The word means retroed ones. Well, first interactions may have been peaceful. North's accounts all tell of eventual violence and hostile relations. This mixed with the fact that the colony of Finland was dependent on interactions with the feeble Greenland colony is likely why the binland colony eventually failed.

Speaker 1:          09:27          Life eventually returned to Greenland where his father Eric soon died of a ds, a disease affecting the entire colony. Life subsequently became chieftain of the call and he was kept busy with Greenlandic affairs for the rest of his life. Though his siblings and other vikings did attempt to reestablish in North American call need for the aforementioned reasons it failed. One of life's brothers in fact was killed and about it. Well, the native Americans in the colony was totally abandoned. However, it is interesting to note the Norse, we're still gathering wood from Markland as late as the 14th century, so they had been aware of this outpost and encountering natives for hundreds of years. It's interesting to consider what would have happened if the north colonies had succeeded and if they would've maintained peaceful relations with the natives. Keep in mind of course, that their discoveries per data Columbus's by over 400 years, if the colony of villains had persists to the north, may have not only maintain a strong social, cultural, ethnic, linguistic, et Cetera, prejudice presence in Canada, but they in custom with north north lifestyle could have persisted in colonize much more of North America.

Speaker 1:          10:27          Where exactly was Finland though for a long time. In fact, up until only recently, it was not really known. People had guests, obviously it was somewhere in Canada or perhaps even the northern United States due to the references of grapes and the climate and such things, but in the 60s to know regions, how it go. And Anna instead using references from locals who believed in nearby runes were native American in origin and using Viking details from their maps and the sagas discovered what they believed to have been the viking colony in Los Oma. Doze on the tip of Newfoundland. The architecture of the settlement is the presence of things such as iron and other details or reinforced the likelihood that this is the Vin Lynde and the Norse Sagas. And from all of this we may gather very obviously the vikings were not just Raiders or murderers or Congress, but there were also explorers and settlers who extended far beyond the reach of any Europeans at the time. Now throughout these videos, I kept referencing viking accounts and the Norse Sagas and some of the next two videos. I want to read two stories from the Viking Sagas to gain a more direct insight into the Viking perspective.
