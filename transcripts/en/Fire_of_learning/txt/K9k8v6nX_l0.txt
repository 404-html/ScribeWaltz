Speaker 1:          00:00          Hello and welcome to fire of learning. When we sync of European colonization of the Americas, we tend to think of the big nations it did so the ones which had large lasting colonies, England, France, Spain, Portugal, the Dutch, and even Russia to some extent. However, we often forget to discuss Sweden and a discussion when Sweden did in fact whole colonial territory in North America territory in fact that for many Americans is much closer to home than they realize, but why? What was it like there? Where did these Swedish colonies go? And this video, we're going to answer all those questions and more as we discussed, Sweden's colonization out of North America. The year is 1638 Sweden is in the middle of the 30 years of war, but it's only beginning. It's rain as an empire, an empire forged by the recently to cease King Gustavus Adolphus. The Swedes don't merely intend to turn their nation into a regional power.

Speaker 1:          00:52          The challenge nearby nations such as Russia, Denmark, and Poland, they have goals to challenge the rest of Europe as well and competes on a global scale. Was France, England, and Spain who are busy beginning of decolonization of distant lands like these nations. Sweden under Queen Christina will attempt to colonized North America. The project was first envisioned 12 years earlier, mainly by its founder of Flemish man named villain was links, one of the founders of the Dutch west India company as well. Villain links was a businessman and a Protestant and saw an opportunity to spread both business and Protestantism and the new world. Disappointed with the activities of the Dutch west India company. He would turn his business interest to an opportunity he saw in Sweden. He acquired permission from King Gustavos Adolphus to found a trading company known as a Swedish south company. The main focus of this company would be trading the resources of the new world, such as primarily for and tobacco accordingly plants and set up a colony to do so.

Speaker 1:          01:52          We're ranged to govern this colony. Ousel links recruited the help of another Dutchman, the former governor of the colony of new Netherland. In fact, patron mean we painter had been replaced as governor of new Netherland following a dispute involving illegal first rate. Accordingly, now jobless and with experience trading in a new world. He was the perfect man for the job. In 1637 and expedition of two shifts was organized. This collaboration between these individuals and other Dutch businessmen, the Swedish government and businessmen from places like the holy Roman Empire set off for the new world. The following year. In March, they landed in an area that is now the present city of Wilmington, Delaware, considerably south from where a few centuries earlier, the ancestral relatives of the Swedish, the Icelandic and Greenlandic vikings had landed when they discovered the new world. The men surveyed the land and eventually selected a location along the Delaware River, which they believed would be easy to defend from attacks from native Americans or the Dutch or the English who had ambiguous claims.

Speaker 1:          02:56          The same area they called the and the subsequent settlements for Christina after the reigning monarch at the time. Some of them are always first actions where the whole negotiations with a nearby native American tribes, namely Volvo, not pay and the Susko Hanuk after establishing trading agreements, land agreements as well as other diplomatic terms for these tribes. The Swedish helps secure the position on the continent and left their main threat as a Dutch who were settled in nearby territory. The north mainly in the modern day state and city of New York. Fortunately for the Swedish or the Dutch, currently lacks sufficient manpower for a major battle. Having accomplished many of the preparations for the call Neiman, we returned to Sweden to bring a second load of colonists. This settlement, unfortunately on this voyage while stopping in the Caribbean to purchase goods to bring back to Europe to help pay for the voyage.

Speaker 1:          03:49          He was caught in a hurricane and parish there. Five years later, he was succeeded by a man named Johan Bjornsen, prince, a Swedish soldier and mercenary weighing somewhere around 400 pounds. The native Americans would refer to him as big belly. He and the settlers, he brought over what continued to maintain amicable relations with the natives of the area. Prince would establish Fort Naya Elfsborg and Fortune Naya Guttenberg, thereby expanding the settlement and securing a Swedish defenses against a potential Dutch English or native invasions, though forced Naya Elfsborg nicknamed Fort Mosquito was eventually abandoned mainly because of the surplus number of the bogs in the area. That's a time the defenses were mainly precautionary. The Swedish were concerned a potential attack, but the settlers coming mainly from Sweden, Finland, and other parts of the Swedish empire as well as Netherlands, Denmark, and Germany who would eventually number around 600 coexisted mostly peacefully with their native Dutch and English neighbors at first with time, however, tensions would strain.

Speaker 1:          04:53          The Swedish would eventually support the Susko. Hancock's in a war against England and land disputes continued with a Dutch. The settlers of new Sweden were of a variety of backgrounds. They were craftsmen, farmers, mercenary soldiers, businessmen, Lutheran ministers who can it to first Lutheran Church in the Americas, et cetera. They brought with them a building technique, which was common in Finland and Sweden at the time log cabins. The usefulness of these structures was quickly adopted by colonists from the Netherlands and England and other places as well who are not as familiar with the structure log cabins of course remain with us to to stay in varying forms all originating with a Swedish and Finnish sellers. Prince was an effective leader of new Sweden and contributed a great deal to its efficiency and prosperity. However, he ruled with what many of the colonists felt was too much power and to petition began to replace him, which was successful in 1653 and 1654 he was replaced by Johan class and rising one of risings first actions.

Speaker 1:          05:54          Upon arriving in new Sweden as governor was to front the now hostile dush wet erected a fort called Fort Chasm here nearby. He took this forward without firing a single shot as a Dutch lacked any gum powder with wish to defend themselves. The Swedish rename the fort to Fort Trinity fearing a response rising then ordered the defenses of porkers sooner to be strengthened. Ricing was correct in his fears and 1655 as the second northern war erupted in Europe and southern Dutch and Swedish on opposite sides. The governor of the Dutch colonies haters, stripe is sont laid siege to for Christina with seven ships and over 300 soldiers, outgunned and outnumbered. The Swedish eventually decided to surrender for Christina to the Dutch which the victors would rename to Fort Altina with a Swedish military busy defending Europe. Reinforcements from the homeland were entirely unlikely and indeed never came.

Speaker 1:          06:47          Sweden's colonization attempts in North America, though at first prosperous unfortunately failed within a few decades with the loss of fork. Christina, the Dutch were not exactly cruel to Swedish settlers that remained. It was demanded that they submit and become Dutch subjects, but those refused. We're merely returned to Europe. Those who stayed were allowed some autonomy. They were allowed to form their own militia, continue trading as they had continued to practice their religion and speak their languages. I of course, mostly Swedish and Finnish and retain their lands. Some sellers from the Swedish empire continued to come to new Sweden. Fact, this subjugated Swedish colony continued officially until the Dutch colonies were in turn annex by the English and in 1681 when William Penn receipt as charter for Pennsylvania where new Sweden overlapped, the colonists remained. They're assimilating and the societies, I will continue to emerge in the states of Delaware and New Jersey, New York, etc.

Speaker 1:          07:41          However, very few modern day Americans of Swedish and Finnish descent artists Senate from these original colonists. The vast majority came as immigrants to the United States in the 19th century. Though new Sweden was not exactly successful, its foundation and presence are significant and a greater story of European colonization of the Americas. Sweden with later hold other overseas territories, even in the Americas, the Caribbean to be precise, but its hopes to expand its empire outside its regional boundaries were unfortunately lost, perhaps primarily with this story, the support, the creation of more videos like these, a link to that channels patriotic can be found in the description.
