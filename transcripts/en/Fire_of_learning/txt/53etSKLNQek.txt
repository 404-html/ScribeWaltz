Speaker 1:          00:00          When in the course of human events it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another and to assume among the powers of the earth the separate and equal station to which the laws of nature and of nature's God entitled them. A decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impelled them to the separation. We hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by the creator with certain unalienable rights. That among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness that to secure these rights governments are instituted among men deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed. That whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the right of the people to alter or abolish it.

Speaker 1:          00:43          And to institute a new government laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form as to them shall seem most likely to effect their safety and happiness. Prudence indeed will dictate that governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes and accordingly all experience hath shown that mankind are more disposed to suffer while evils are sufferable than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations pursuing invariably the same object events is it designed to reduce them under absolute despotism it is their right. It is their duty to throw off such government and to provide new guards for their future security. Such has been the patient sufferance of these colonies and such is now than it says that he was constrained as them to alter their former systems of government.

Speaker 1:          01:28          The history of the present king of Great Britain has a history of repeated injuries and usurpations all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute tyranny over these states to prove this, let facts be submitted to a candid world. He has refused his assent to laws the most wholesome and necessary for the public good. He has forbidden, has governors to pass laws of immediate and pressing importance and less suspended and their operation till has essentially be obtained and when so suspended he has utterly neglected to attend to them. He has refused to pass the real loss for the accommodation of large districts of people unless those people would relinquish the right of representation in the legislature or write an estimable to them and formidable to tyrants only. He has called together legislative bodies that places unusual, uncomfortable and distant from the pository of their public records for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures.

Speaker 1:          02:16          He has dissolved representative houses repeatedly for opposing with manly firmness has invasions on the rights of the people he has refused for a long time after such dissolutions to cause others to be elected whereby the legislative powers and capable of annihilation have returned to the people at large for their exercise. The state remaining in the meantime exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without and convulsions within. He has endeavored to prevent the population of these states for that purpose of struck and laws of naturalization of foreigners. Refusing the past others to encourage them migration, Heather and raising the conditions of new appropriations of lands. He has obstructed the administration of justice for refusing because it's sent to laws for establishing judiciary powers. He has made judges dependent on his will alone for tenure of their offices and the amounts and payment of their salaries.

Speaker 1:          03:03          He has erected a multitude of new offices and sent Heather swarms of officers to harass our people and eat out their substance. He has kept among us in times of peace standing armies without the consent of our legislature. He has affected to render the military independent of and superior to the civil power he has combined with others to subject us to jurisdictions foreign to our constitution and unacknowledged by our laws, giving his ascent, their acts of pretended legislation for quartering large bodies of arm troops among us for protecting them by a mock trial from punishment for any murders which they should commit on the inhabitants of these states for cutting off our trade with all parts of the world, for imposing taxes on us without our consent for depriving us in. Many cases of the benefits of trial by jury for transporting us beyond sees to be tried for pretended offenses, for abolishing the free system of English flaws in a neighboring province, establishing their in an arbitrary government and enlarging its boundaries so as to render it at once and example and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these colonies for taking away our charters, abolishing our most valuable laws and altering fundamentally to forms of our governments for suspending our own legislature's and declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for all of us in all cases whatsoever.

Speaker 1:          04:15          He has abdicated government here by declaring us out of his protection and waging war against us. He has plundered our CS, ravaged our coast, burnt our towns in his store, the lives of our people. He is at this time transporting large armies of foreign mercenary. See Complete the works of death, desolation and tyranny already begun with circumstances of cruelty, imperfect. He's scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous age as in totally unworthy of the head of a civilized nation. He has constrained our fellow citizens taking captive on the high seas to bear arms against their country to become the executioners of their friends and brethren or to follow themselves by their hands. He has excited the mastic insurrections amongst us and has endeavored to bring on the inhabitance of our frontiers, the merciless Indian savages whose known rule of warfare as an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes, and conditions.

Speaker 1:          05:04          In every stage of these oppressions, we have petition for redress. In the most humble terms, our repeated petitions have been answered only by repeated injury. A prince who his character is us marked by every act, which made a finance [inaudible] is unfit to be the ruler of a free people. Nor have we been wanting an attention to our British brethren. We have warned them from time to time of attempts by the legislature to extend an unwarranted ball jurisdiction over us. We have reminded them of the circumstances of our immigration and settlements here we have appeal to their native justice and magnanimity and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindreds disavow these years for patients which would inevitably interrupt our connections in correspondence. They too have been desta voice of Justice and constantly windy. We must therefore acquiesce and the necessity which announces our separation and holds them as we hold the rest of mankind, enemies in war and peace, friends, we therefore the representatives of the United States of America in general, Congress assembled appealing to the supreme judge of the world, of the rectitude of our intentions.

Speaker 1:          06:05          Do in the name and by the authority of the good people of these colonies, solemnly publish and declare that these United colonies are and of right ought to be free and independent states, that they're absolved from all allegiance to the British crown. And that all political connection between them and the state of Great Britain is and ought to be totally dissolved. And that as free and independent states, they have full power to levy war include piece, contract alliances, established commerce, and so all the other acts and things which independent states may have right. Do and for the support of this declaration with a firm reliance on the protection of divine providence, we mutually pledge to each other our lives, our fortunes, and our sacred honor.
