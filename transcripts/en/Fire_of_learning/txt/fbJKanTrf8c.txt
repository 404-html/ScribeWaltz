Speaker 1:          00:00          Ireland. The island takes its name from the old Irish word [inaudible], the name of a goddess, a word meaning bouncing or prosperous. The people of this island have ancient roots to it and its history is likewise long, rich, mysterious and important, not only for the Irish, but for the millions of people living across the world whose ancestors came from this island. In this video, we're going to discuss the history of Ireland and fall, the story of druids and Christians, rebels and loyalists, natives and the invaders struggles and successes, all of which made Ireland what it is today.

Speaker 1:          00:42          It's likely that Ireland was first inhabited around the year 12,500 BC by a hunter gatherer groups. During this time, sea levels were lower and Ireland belonged to continental Europe. Geographically. By 4,000 BC, farming had likely made its way to the island and become commonplace. Ireland entered the bronze age around 2000 BC being in a fortunate location for this age as it was heavy and copper and near Cornwall, which produced him. The Iron Age began around 600 BC. It is during the Iron Age that Ireland's modern identity begins to take shape as Celtic peoples from mainland Europe and Britain began migrating to the island and mixing with the indigenous population. Prior to the arrival of the Celts, Ireland was very sparsely inhabited and unorganized. The Celts would bring it on it's path toward higher civilization. For such main waves of Celtic migrations would occur. It was the Celts who had brought the Iron Age to Ireland along with religion that would form the basis of the paganism of the British isles language, which would evolve into the modern Irish language trade connections, the main continent and his social structure and culture which would dominate the island for centuries.

Speaker 1:          01:55          The first writings of the island come from the Greek and Roman explorers who referred to the island under a variety of names and made a number of reports about the island. Though many of these reports were likely false and a time is fantastical. They would last and the Roman impressions of the island giving ancient Ireland and the Celts in general, a mysterious aura, which truth be told lasts to this day. In a way. The first person to actually give a fairly accurate report of the island was Julius Caesar who called the island. He Barnea a corruption of the ancient Greek word for the island, the land of the [inaudible], which would come to mean the land of winter, sharing a common route with the word hibernaid. Caesar also said that it was located to the west of Brittania and about half its size, one of the most accurate descriptions of Ireland up to that point.

Speaker 1:          02:44          Those some Romans like a Greek law considered it the Romans would never invade he baron Ya. What? They did interact primarily because of Rome's presence on the island of Britain. Archeological findings of Roman coins on Ireland suggests complex interaction and trade. It's possible that the Romans set up trading up posts in certain areas of Ireland and perhaps military outposts with the purpose of protecting his trade. One such commodity which they traded would've been slaves. The Romans no doubt purchased them from the Irish to work on the agricultural centers of Roman Britain. It is likely that the Irish took part in Roman conflicts as barbarian mercenaries, which was common in the Roman empire, especially in the later years. They also likely were at times Raiders in pirates who assaulted the western coast of or Tanya, but also settled it. Rome would never invade. He Beronia for two main reasons.

Speaker 1:          03:35          The first was that there wasn't a major tactical advantage in doing so. It was unknown territory on the border of the known world. It would have been very complicated trying to subdue the island and the Romans weren't sure what they gain from it economically, strategically or politically. Accordingly, resources and manpower were better utilized slightly east against the pics of modern Scotland. The moment Rome moved troops from Britannia to Hibernia, the pics would likely seize the opportunity and attack. If Rome had ruled the whole island, maybe they would've gone to Ireland as well. Though we'll never know though there was interaction with the Romans. Ireland was one of the few areas of western Europe which was allowed primarily to develop on its own. During this time, the Irish relied on small communities of subsistence farming where kettle or sometimes other goods like slaves were essentially the form of currency.

Speaker 1:          04:27          In some writings it is said that one slave girl was equal in worth to about six cows. They lacked major towns and cities, but they did have early kinds of towns and roads between them. Even through bogs and marshes. The island was, as I said, divided among many different tribes who are often at war with each other. A main cause of warfare. These cattle primarily disputes over ownership and the theft of them. The Celts introduced new power structures to Ireland when they came and there would have been perhaps a hundred to 200 kings across Ireland really in their own small countries due to the land differences in the various tribes, four distinct regions would form in Ireland holster, lanster monster and conduct these divisions dating back to ancient times. Last to this day, the final and most notable group of Celts were the gales who's influenced would eventually extend across the whole island and even the parts of western Scotland in the fifth century.

Speaker 1:          05:19          Their culture and identity would be firmly rooted and permanence in Ireland. To this day, the Irish language calls itself gala guy and in English the word Gaelic is still synonymous with the people and culture of Ireland, though they did right using an Ogun writing system on stones and wood, the Irish at this time lacked books and literature. There are pagan religion, which was banned by Rome and modern England thrive there. We don't know a lot about this religion from their perspective or much about their home and people in this time in general because of their lack of extensive writing. Much of what we know comes from the Greeks and Romans and centuries later Christian monks who recorded tales, which were preserved verbally, naturally the Romans who sought to convince their people that they had to conquer the Celts and the Christians who sought to converse. The pagans are considered the most reliable or honest sources.

Speaker 1:          06:10          Thankfully, however important parts of this time survived, which along with archeology allows us to understand them better. The Irish Celts were animistic. They saw spirits in the natural world around them so that it's trees, water, rocks, animals. Fire, etc. And thus had a deep spiritual connection to the natural world. They worshiped many gods and spirits somewhere local. Others were coming across Celtic culture. They believed in an other world which could have meant many different things though was primarily in afterlife, a world of spirits and the dead. Some said it existed at the West across the sea. Others said it ran parallel to our own world, sometimes the barriers between his world and the other world or broken leading to a number of strange events to interpret this complex religion where the dri known in English as a Jewish, the druids were not only priests, but also legal authorities, leaders, philosophers, historians and doctors.

Speaker 1:          07:08          Oftentimes they held as much power as the king's whom they advised. One of the more shocking aspects of this paganism was human sacrifice. They'll Roman sources likely exaggerated the amount of human sacrifice occurring at the time it was present in Pagan Ireland before Roman contact and likely still continued after it. The details of it, however, are unclear because the Irish was somewhat isolated from both Rome and the rest of the world. Irish society was not fractured when the empire began to fall. In fact, rather the Irish saw an opportunity in a collapsing Roman Britain and began raids on it. Nevertheless, Rome's religion. Christianity would not only outlive it, but would spread rapidly to centuries following its collapse with Ireland, right in its sights. Christianity would transform Ireland and connect it to the rest of the world and important ways and the man would bring it. There was first the Romano Britain teenager captured as a slave by the Irish named souk. It better known by his Christian name. Patrick.

Speaker 1:          08:10          There are a number of details missing from Saint Patrick's life, such as when and where exactly he was born and while many details have been filled in with myths, historians agree widely that he was a real person. Patrick was Levy born in Wales or western England in the late fourth century at the age of 16 he was captured by Irish Raiders and taken back to Ireland where he worked as an enslaved to shepherd for six years until he escaped and returned back to per Tanya. During his enslavement. He held on to something which he formerly hadn't cared about much his home religion, Christianity. Upon returning home, he joined the church studying and working throughout France and Britain until his piety and dedication earned him an important assignment from the pope to travel back to Ireland and spread Christianity there. Patrick, of course, had plenty of reason not to go back to the country which had made him a slave, but also in his eyes, plenty of reason to do so.

Speaker 1:          09:06          He knew the Irish language. He knew how the people worked. He knew how the religion work, and above all, he claimed to have received a vision from God and a dream commanding him to return. Patrick wouldn't be the first or only missionary to Ireland, but it was for these reasons that he'd likely be the most effective, so he went forward with it. He returned to Ireland and though the Irish were not fond of him, he was able to escape or talk his way out of becoming slaves again or killed or something of that nature. Though in multiple incidents he came close. The Irish particularly at kings and the druids were not fond of Patrick coming and stirring things up due to the importance of religion in his time period in Ireland. He was humble and generous, which ease concerns that this was an attempt to grab power despite opposition.

Speaker 1:          09:52          Patrick is said to have converted and baptize thousands of people and he ordained priest who would go on to found a monasteries of Ireland. He has said to a performed a number of miracles, most of them probably metaphorical such as driving up the snakes of Ireland and converting Celtic warriors who are hundreds of years old. He used nature which was already deeply a part of Irish life to help the Irish understand Christianity. He also mitigated conversion by arguing that the values of the Irish had a greater place in Christianity and converted some of their customs and practices into Christian ones. One of the most notable examples of this practice though not directly from Saint Patrick, was turning the Pagan holiday of saw one into the Christian holiday of Halloween. Patrick would continue his work in Ireland until the end of his life. The importance of this was not only that the Irish change religions, it in fact sparked a revolution in Irish society by connecting it with the rest of Europe.

Speaker 1:          10:49          As the dark ages began to creep over Europe and event, which you can learn about in detail in my dark ages, documentary Ireland, which was formerly regarded as a backward and dark place, actually became an area of enlightenment and preservation of learning at a time when only 1% of the European population could read. The monasteries in Ireland worked diligently and preserving the written works of Europe and spreading education and enlightenment. They did this to such a degree that many came from Britain and the European mainland to study in Ireland. Not only were these works in Latin, but they also wrote in Irish and unusual habit as Latin was generally preferred to the vernacular throughout Europe. Though gradually becoming United under Christianity, Arland was still not unified as a nation, nor would it be throughout the Middle Ages and the fifth, sixth and seventh centuries. However larger kingdoms began arising on the island, such as monster would Kannok and Meath.

Speaker 1:          11:46          However, they were not nation states as we have now, nor would they really actually kingdoms because there was a sense that the land belongs to the tribe, not the kings. They were really groups made up of loosely. You netted clans, tribes and families, which they called a two Aha plural, of to, uh, one of the most powerful families in Ireland at the time where the nail that ascendance of Nile, of the nine hostages, one of the first great kings of Ireland, a figure of both myth and fact, this family would dominate much of the Norris governing the life of the Irish were the Breton laws are unique set of laws, which the Irish said we're as old as the rocks and which would seem unusual to us as they weren't enforced by kings or state authorities, nor were they made by them. They were kind of held commonly the brands which were illegal authorities in a sense, acted more like mediators that are modern judges.

Speaker 1:          12:41          Laws apply to everyone and in fact, at times the wealthier and more powerful you were, the more you paid for your crimes. Early Ireland place great emphasis on the family and tribe, much less individualistic than the modern west and thus the families of criminals where sometimes liable for certain crimes at least financially and would have to compensate the alienated family if found guilty. Though these laws were very ancient, they were effective and very organized and they actually do not necessarily fade into a better legal system as we shall see. Rather they meet the disapproval of the English at the centers of these kingdoms were actually the monasteries and a society still lacking major cities. Monasteries were not only places of religion learning and study, but gradually became places of economic and political power. The church and this time period had no reserves about getting involved in wars and in fact monasteries in Ireland.

Speaker 1:          13:37          We're not only responsible for taking part in wars, but at times directing them against each other. Wars remained common, all able bodied males except for the well educated and the priests were expected to be available to fight for the Kings in times of war. At this time as well, came to miss, began forming in England, Wales and Scotland, many of those in England where the formations of the Anglo Saxons Group of barbarians from northern Central Europe who gradually began taking over the remains of Roman Britain, laying the foundations for what will become eventually England. These Anglo Saxons were along with the pics of Scotland to the north, still pagan. Adding an ironic reversal of roles from the Roman era as now Ireland was a seed of Christianity in the British isles. The Irish who were religiously active throughout Europe got to work on converting their neighbors from the Kingdom of Doll Rita, which spanned both Ireland and Scotland.

Speaker 1:          14:31          Irish missionaries such as Columbia ventured into the dark pagan wild to convert pick fund to Christianity. It's worth mentioning also that this was not yet Scotland. The names. Scotland is actually an English misnomer, which comes from the Latin Scotty, which actually referred to the gales and later the gales living in Scotland and then all of Scotland. In other words to Scotty were Irish. Columbia would have great success here and would found the powerful and important Abby on Iona. Another important I wish figure of this age was Colombani who's set up a number of monasteries in Europe. Debate exists about the legitimacy of the term dark ages, especially relative to the darkness of other ages, regardless of the darkness of this era compared to others. However, Ireland was one of the brightest places to be in the first part of the early Middle Ages in the late 18th and early 19th century.

Speaker 1:          15:25          That would be going to change as Ireland still continued in this era and even as much of western Europe was crawling out of illiteracy and intellectual decline under Charlemagne. New threats from outside Chris and them began to close in. The greatest threat and impediment to the Irish were the vikings. As you know, if you've seen my other videos including my documentary on the Vikings, the Vikings had a major effect on Europe and Ireland was no exception. They came first as Raiders, plunderers and murderers, but later as we shall see, they became builders and creators. The first attack on Ireland came in the year seven 95 on Rathlin island near Antrum Modern Day Northern Ireland. The Vikings attacked the church on the island, plundered what they could kill. The monks burned everything and left a trend which was consistent throughout the Viking age. Similar to the famous raids on Lindisfarne just two years earlier, though, these were not the same group of Vikings.

Speaker 1:          16:24          While Danish vikings prefer to focus on Britain and Charlemagne's empire, those who concentrated on Ireland where at first likely Norwegians Ireland, much like Britain occupied a very unfortunate position and the Viking age. It was an island and the vikings were masters sailors that the vikings would attack other notable locations that year under the rule of Irishmen such as Iona and inish. Marie in the late 18th and early 19th century, viking raids on Ireland weren't constant. They were perhaps only once or a few times a year with some years not seeing any viking activity at all. Nevertheless, the raid struck fear into the hearts of the Irish. The vikings could attack without warning almost anywhere on the island from out of nowhere. A group of large ferocious warriors from a strange unknown country across the sea could descend upon your village and you could lose your home, your family, and your own life.

Speaker 1:          17:18          They spared no one. There was no bargaining with them and little means stopping them. It took some time, but the Irish eventually began responding to this threat and began being the vikings. Around 30 years after their presence was first felt though disrupting Irish society. The true permanent mark on Ireland came and the Vikings arrived. Not the raid, but to settle the process of a heavier Viking presence on Ireland. Begin at eight 37 with events centered around a viking named [inaudible] who is said have married a witch, performed pagan rituals on Christian altars and committed a number of atrocities. Though his existence as uncertain. One of the first major settlements was that of Dublin and eight 41 Dublin, which in Irish means black pool would serve as the most important Viking stronghold in Ireland. What are the most important, in fact, and the British isles and would later evolve into Ireland's capitol city of Dublin, along with Dublin.

Speaker 1:          18:16          The Vikings would also be responsible for founding a number of other major Irish cities such as Waterford, Limerick, Cork, and Wexford from these bases. Viking terror on the British isles intensified. This period is remembered in Irish as Kaga Godell. Regardless the war of the Irish with the foreigners, the vikings came at an ideal time as this was when the nail and the north and the monster Irish and itself, we're involved in a conflict preventing a unified resistance to them. At first, cooperative resistance would come though, and then eight 45 it is recorded that the king of mead mailshake nail captured Thor guests and drowned him. Hey, United Irish effort was repelling Viking incursions, saving Ireland from complete North's domination. Though Norse men continue to move into Ireland, including now Danish Vikings, the death of thorniest or an equivalent great victory. It again remains uncertain, disrupted and organized invasion and the round the year aid 50 as civil war erupted between two groups of Vikings, one side who in the Irish called the white foreigners, possibly Norwegians led by a viking known as a off the white and the black foreigners, possibly the Danish led by Viking that the Irish called Emr, possibly Ivonne a boneless, the same viking who would later be one of the leaders of the great heathen army.

Speaker 1:          19:35          The Irish were not only glad to see this division erupt, but also took part in it with some like mailshake nail fighting. What was in his eyes, a holy war of expulsion. Another group important in this conflict where the high burden north or north scales or group of people of both Irish and Norris heritage resulting from Irish and viking interaction and marriage. Their existence was a sign of Viking permanence on Ireland. The vikings eventually ended the civil war and announced a joint rule of Dublin and eight 57 in the eyes of many Irish, the vikings would now be harder to budge. A unified resistance of the vikings was losing ground and mailshake nail would ultimately be unsuccessful and his efforts and he would die of seemingly natural causes in age 62 with Ireland divided between various Viking and Irish kingdoms and his kingdom becoming divided amongst successors as these kingdoms would now not only interact but form alliances against each other in certain circumstances with their position now secured many high Burno vikings would now focus on the much wealthier opportunities of the Anglo Saxon Kingdoms and eight seventies however, sources indicate that both Olaf and Emr died while campaigning and Britain leading to a less vigorous of Viking presence in Ireland and nine oh two as a result of this, a group of Irish under male Finna Mick Flanagan and Kerbal McMurray mcmurrin routed the vikings from Dublin, essentially ending the first viking age in Ireland.

Speaker 1:          21:04          This victory was a short lived as the vikings. We returned in nine 14 reclaiming Dublin and expanding in other parts of the island. Despite they return, they would not make much effort to control Ireland again, still focusing on England and as a result, their power began fading in the early 10th century. The Viking invasion started coming to an end around the year nine 50 and this date is often considered to be the end of the Viking age in Ireland, though not at all the end of the north presence in Ireland, the Norse still in Ireland, especially the north scales as we shall see, remained active and retained their rule primarily in the south and east as they had been militarily unsuccessful in the north. I'll be it more as kings of nations than heads of raiding parties. Nevertheless, this would be the beginning of a slow process with a viking stove to assimilate into Irish custom speak Irish follow Irish religion and live like Irishman around this time across the Irish Sea in England, the many Anglo Saxon Kingdoms were beginning to unite under west six becoming a more modern kingdom of England.

Speaker 1:          22:10          Similar changes were happening elsewhere in Europe as well, and a movement to consolidate power under a single ruler in Ireland was inevitable. Such a movement would come from the ruler of a less powerful kingdom of monster by a man named Brian [inaudible]. Brian was a son of the king of doll cosh kinetic Maclaurin when his father died in nine 51 rural pastor, Brian's older brother, Megaman Megaman set about trying to become the king of all monster, capturing a rock of Cashel, the historic capital of the region. This naturally invited conflict with his Irish and Norse neighbors and in nine 76 he was murdered during the negotiation, which was claimed be peaceful by his rival male mood. Brian inherited the throne and set about trying to continue his brother's work. Brian is described as a born warrior. He had learned a considerable amount about not only Irish warfare, but also viking warfare.

Speaker 1:          23:07          As a result, you place an emphasis on naval superiority. He would go to war with male mood and the Viking came them of limerick defeating them both and extending his authority across monster. He would kill mail mood, but interestingly, his son Keon would be spared and throughout Brian's life remained an ally. But north of Limerick is well wealthy and powerful. We're allowed to live peacefully so long as they remained loyal to Brian. Brian then turned his ambitions outside monster into neighboring areas, specifically lends to Arconic and mead. This would draw him into conflict with mailshake nail king of mead who claim to be the high king of Ireland. The conflict would be long and bloody, but by nine any six, Brian controlled Lenstar and was proving themselves to be militarily superior. This essentially forced a peace negotiation with Brian Lang, claim of the south and check nail.

Speaker 1:          23:59          The north though piece externally had been secured momentarily stability was threatened on the inside as well. Not all the kings of Ireland were content to recognize. Brian is hiking and rebellion in lunch through occurred not long after this, aided by the high burden north of Dublin in a war ending in the year nine 99 at the battle of Glen Mama, Brian defeated both armies encaptured Dublin as well, the wealthy center of the island. Now Brian was ready to break the piece he had made with CIC nail and he invaded mead defeating the Kingdom and 10 oh two now the only region which Brian had the gain was Ulster in the northeast almost there would not be quite so easily obtained and the first Brian's armies were defeated. Much of his advanced us was left to cooperation with the Catholic church, which was an elite in Ireland.

Speaker 1:          24:48          Notably by recognizing their authority and bribing them with a church on his side, Brian would begin seeing more success in obtaining all star in the year 10 oh eight by 10 11 Brian had defeated the canal Connell of Western holster. He was now truly high king of Ireland or as a church called him and Perah tour. [inaudible] meaning emperor of the Scots or as you recall, emperor of the gales. It is also around this time that he also received his surname Baru or an old Irish bar rumor. This is related to the modern Irish word bow, meaning cow. He was Brian of the cattle tributes in a society where cattle were the symbol of wealth. This was a great title. Brian and the church were now seemingly began to realize their vision, a United Ireland under the authority of one king, yet there was still work to be done.

Speaker 1:          25:39          It would be more correct view Brian not as the king of a single kingdom, but the king on top of other kings which ruled their own kingdoms. Furthermore, while the Norris Gail Kingdoms like Dublin limerick also recognize Brian as their high king, they were much more removed from Irish society and still functioned to a strong degree independently under their own law. How Far Brian could have gone as high king of all Ireland remains uncertain as not long after he accomplish this, it began to break apart discontented kings in Lenstar and Ulster rose up in rebellion and 10 12 and attacked mead and later north scales specifically Dubliners would join in on the rebellion, which will be led by mail morta. To make matters worse as fighting intensified mailshake nail kink of mead betrayed Brian, the two sides would meet at the battle of [inaudible] April 23rd 10 14 the battle ended with a mix of results.

Speaker 1:          26:40          The Irish under Brian had won the battle thus curtailing the power, the high burden nor significantly in event, which is often regarded as a true and of the cog had Godell regardless. However, Brian was actually killed in this battle. It's not exactly known how, but legend states that he was decapitated by a rogue viking named [inaudible] who cut through Irish lions and found Brian in his tent than age there. Ron, probably 70 in prayer, hopes of a United Ireland died for a time with Brian Baru as contenders all began struggling from the throne. Brian's the sentence, however, which continued to rule Munster. This family is known as the O'brien's and name which like the nail who became their own Neal's would persist throughout Irish history. Through the modern day and even into the 24th century, Brian's family and Munster made efforts to reclaim the title of hiking and his son Duncan McBrian would claim the title, though it was not widely recognized and he was one of many who would be known as a [inaudible] and Kfar Saba hiking with opposition.

Speaker 1:          27:46          While they may considerable gains and had notable successes, they would be ultimately unsuccessful, especially as soon as the sentence turn on each other. When Mira talk was Brian Brews, grandson gave up his position as king power shifted from Munster to conduct and the O'connor family, specifically Thurlow O'connor Turla set about trying to win the true title of High King, but had we control over much of Ireland and never controlled Olster, his son, Rory O'connor would succeed him, but he would face a United invasion from lenstoler under Dermot McMorrow and Olster under Maria Talk Mclaughlin. As a result, your light himself with Tiernan, Eroica, Britney, and war ensued O'Connor and or work. We're victorious. And an 1166 O'connor was crowned high king and Dublin O'connor ruled as a true high king with the political and religious figures of our lend, all recognizing his authority, Dermot Mcmurray Lenstar, however, had escaped and fled eastward with no intention of letting this be final.

Speaker 1:          28:53          Dermot fled to England and then to France. In search of Henry, the second grandson and William the conqueror, the king of the Norman Empire, and subsequently King of England, the Normans, descendants of a mix of vikings in French. We're one of the strongest military forces in Europe, unable to beat O'Connor on his own. He realized foreign aid would be the key to retaking is thrown in Leicester. As a result of this, Dermot is often regarded by the Irish as one of the worst, a long line of Irishman who betray their country for the favors of foreigners, namely the English. For now, Dermot was inviting a neighbor into his own nation with whom on Bono's to him. Of course, the Irish would quarrel for nearly a thousand years. Dermot met with Henry the second, and Henry agreed to support Dermot and exchange for his loyalty. Henry would not join Durant personally, but granted him the right recruit English soldiers and mercenaries for his conquest.

Speaker 1:          29:52          Dermot found a number of powerful Norman allies, including Robert Fitts, Steven Marise, Fitzgerald, and Richard Fitz Gilbert known as land as we shot arc for Richard Strongbow. Dermot offered Strongbow a very enticing deal in exchange for his help. He would allow him to marry his daughter Eva and would name him his successor as king of Lenster, effectively transferring rural of an Irish came them over to a Norman loyal to another king. There was also money to be made and land to grab in Ireland, which Strongbow and his allies figured would enhance their power and prestige. Dermot did not introduce the concept of invading Arlinda Henry the second Henry had actually been considering it for some time and even received support from the church as Pope Adrian, the fourth and Alexander the third. We're concerned about the independent nature of the Irish church. However, he did provide Henry with an opportunity that he couldn't refuse.

Speaker 1:          30:49          Dermot and Strongbow assembled an army of Norman's Saxons and Welshman and the Tact Wexford and 1169 those strong boasts stayed behind for the time Dermot them again pushing further into Ireland, but was eventually met by O'connor who began to feeding his forces. The two sides met at ferns for negotiations which were mediated by the church. It was agreed that Dermot could once again become king of Lens there as long as he continued to recognize warrior O'connor as high king later and private. They are said to have agreed to stop bringing foreigners into Irish fights, but it was too late for that strong arrived and 1170 and took Dublin, began to feeding O'Connor as winter set in and the two armies seized. Royal Connor began fearing that he wouldn't be able to best Strongbow in May of 1171 matters complicated. Further, when Dermot died, Dermot McMorrow had essentially died before he could enjoy the rule of lunch or for which and the eyes of his countryman.

Speaker 1:          31:48          He's sold Arland soul. Though historically speaking, with or without Dermot, the Normans probably would've come to Ireland anyway. Dermot son tried to claim the throne of Lens through an accordance with the Breton laws, but Strongbow who had married Dermot's daughter by this point had been guaranteed a throne and was militarily more powerful, succeeded him. This concerned not only the Irish, but King Henry as well. Henry was suspicious of strong motives, especially given the strong most father was an opponent who had opposed his succession during a civil war known as the anarchy in England. Now, Strongbow had married into the Irish nobility and ruled as king of Lens. They're unsure of his loyalties. Henry felt he had to invade Ireland. Though at first Strongbow ignored him. Henry was able to secure as loyalties with only the threat of invasion. Nevertheless, power in Ireland still remained unsteady.

Speaker 1:          32:44          Strongbows governance was disliked by the North Scales and the Irish kings and the Irish church. We're not very happy with, uh, Norman arrival either and would likely oppose it again violently. So Henry decided to invade that year. Henry invade with a forest of around 5,000. These soldiers were highly trained and well armed and armored. Many Irish King's felt that resistance was futile, especially as they weren't only dealing with the English, but a forest which had the backing of the Vatican. The thus began submitting to Henry the first being Donald McCarthy, the king of Desmond. Gradually much of Ireland fell to English rule with mostly on the north. Holding out. In 1172 Henry began encouraging English colonization of Ireland and allowed hue to Lacie to push in the mead. Ireland was now a nation of four languages, Irish Anglo, Norman, French, Latin, and old English, which would have a lasting effect on the linguistics of Ireland.

Speaker 1:          33:41          The norm is began, solidified their position in Ireland as they had done in other regions, including England, a century earlier. This along with the Catholic church moving into Ireland and pressing forms, intermarriage and attempts to reorganize the country territorially and legally by introducing feudalism and replacing Brett and law with English law would have a permanent effect on Ireland as well. The English felt that they were civilizing Ireland, much like the Romans. The Irish weren't content with this and though facing a stronger occupying force would begin resistance in wars marking the beginning of Anglo Irish conflict, which would last for centuries. Vo, Rory O'connor and Henry agreed to terms with the tree of Windsor O'connor fail to control the other Irish kings and Henry a times fail to control his own Norman subjects as well. Many were busy carving out kingdoms and territories for themselves and 1177 Henry made his son John Dominus, he Barney I Lord of Ireland when he was only 10 years old.

Speaker 1:          34:42          He would of course not assumed command of his position until he was matured and trained, but in 1185 at the age of 18 you left England for Dublin much to his father's disappointment and the resentment of the Irish kings. He was expected to rule John acted like a clown. An example of this is that when he first encountered them, he mocked the beer is of the Irish kings and pulled on them when he got to work. Ultimately he failed and the conflicts against the Irish wouldn't pay his soldiers and failed secure royal authority over the English settlers there. He left that December returning back to England in 1199 King John unexpectedly came to the throne. Ireland remained divided between English and Irish rule. Some Lens. We're steadily English, but others much less so and many areas of the country still defiantly under Irish rule, though remembered as an insane and an effective ruler and English history.

Speaker 1:          35:38          John did work on capitulating Ireland considerably by reorganizing the system of governance on the island and showing loyalty to him. Nevertheless, rebellion even among John's own subjects would sprout up and it is at this time that we see another feature of the Anglo Irish conflict emerge. The Irish turn to the enemy of their enemy France. For support, though these rebellions were unsuccessful for as long as England would control Ireland, England's enemies, specifically France and Spain would take an interest in encouraging trouble in Ireland. The aangeland Norman's would continue attempting to expand into Ireland throughout the reign of Henry the third John's successor specifically into regions such as conduct where high king O'Connor had originally hailed. This became more and more difficult as some Anglo Norman's in Ireland were ruling more and more independently and others had lost interest in Arland altogether. Furthermore, the Irish were adopting the technology and tactics of the rest of Europe and working with Scottish mercenaries against English rule, allowing them to refuse to pay tribute and to raid the English Lens, which was contributing to a weakening Norman presence on the island.

Speaker 1:          36:50          Importantly, and the 13th century, the ideals of the English nobility, which had been emphasize in reaction to King John's tyrannical rule that eventually led to the magna Carta spread into Ireland as well. This became much more evident in the reign of Edward the first when in 1297 the Irish parliament form. This was not necessarily a move to grant the English in Ireland more independence, but rather it wasn't attempt to ensure English law was upheld in Ireland as well as English culture. In a time when the English there were becoming worryingly Irish, a trend which would continue for centuries. It was also though a move to led the Anglo Irish deal with their own problems because Edward had enough of his own, namely in France and Scotland, resistance under the leadership of a nobleman named William Wallace was beginning and Scotland. Tensions between England and Scotland were heating up and Arland would feel the effects of this and see opportunity within it.

Speaker 1:          37:48          Independent Ireland and Scotland were at this time, culturally, historically, linguistically, ethnically, etc. Similar and with a mutual enemy, a cooperative effort was likely to form that we're the first died in 1307 and was succeeded by his son Edward, the second in Scotland a year earlier, Robert the Bruce had become king. The lords of Arlene's saw a potential ally and Robert the Bruce and Bruce felt likewise knowing that an independent Ireland could be crucial in the feeding England in 1315 Robert the Bruce along with his younger brother Edward, devise the plan and their efforts to defeat England. Edward would take a force of around 6,000 soldiers to help liberate Ireland and an exchange. The Irish kings would recognize Edward as high king. This would open up, but as tracking second front in the Anglo Scottish wars and create what they called a grand Gaelic alliance with Robert as king of Scotland and Edward as king of Ireland.

Speaker 1:          38:46          From there, they could move into the aisle of men and secure a similar arrangement in Wales and invade their Edward landed with his army and may of 1315 and eastern Ulster. He was joined by Irish soldiers and began his campaign seeing a great amount of success against the English there and kept pushing into English territory. Within a year, Edward was crowned King of Ireland. However, it was very premature. Unfortunately, this war in a second front had begun during a harsh time, a period of fem and which lasted until 1317 affecting all of Europe with no exception in Ireland, where perhaps up to a quarter of the population to come to the feminine. Feeding the troops was a major burden and though Robert the Bruce, his arrival in the winter of 1316 was encouraging. It only increased a number of mouths to feed and by 1317 fighting between the two sides was slowing down as both sides lack the ability to continue to fight.

Speaker 1:          39:45          That year, the Irish began splitting off from the main Scottish army into their own movements and when Edward failed to capture Dublin and limerick cities which were considerably loyal to England, the movement began to fall apart. And later in October of 1318 Edward, the Bruce died in battle. Despite a technical English victory, Ireland was becoming too difficult to control. This war had torn apart English authority on the island and English power began waning and the area over the course of the 14th century though controlling many parts of the island, the English monarchy only truly held power in the areas around Dublin. In 1327 Edward the third came to the throne. He began attempting to bring order to Ireland once again by various means, including increasing and administrative presence, backed by a military presence and executing political rivals in Ireland while viewing the Anglo Irish with contempt and barring them from public offices.

Speaker 1:          40:43          The Anglo Irish protested claiming these new reforms would bring instability to the island, yet the policies held, but all the while the Irish were constantly causing havoc on the borders with instability and war constant in Ireland. The black death reached the island and 1348 exacerbating everything and killing likely over half the population of Ireland. The plague was most intense, the towns and cities where English power was concentrated and thus the native Irish gained more power and authority. By 1360 the situation was so desperate that the Anglo Irish wrote to the king informing him that if nothing was done, Ireland will be lost. In response, Edwards sent his son Lionel to Ireland with an army to restore authority primarily to ensure Ireland's loyalty and economic profitability during war with France. Lionel was not greatly successful and many in England complained that the resources required to hold on to Ireland far outweighed its economic worth and even if it were worth it, England had more significant problems like France and Scotland as well as these sicknesses and feminines which cause havoc on the nation.

Speaker 1:          41:53          By this point, the Anglo Irish becoming now truly worryingly Irish as they were speaking Irish dressing like the Irish intermarrying with them starting to fall a brand and law and altogether living like the Irish. As a result, Lionel called together the Irish parliament attic Kilkenny and created a new set of laws known as the statutes of cocaine concerning the lives of the Anglo Irish. The intention of these laws was to bring the Anglo Irish back to their English roots by Bending Englishman from speaking Irish, dressing like them, interacting with them in various ways such as marriage and certain kinds of business and even bending their Irish names, forcing them to anglicize them. This sounds like an effective means of bringing the island back under English control, but unfortunately for the English, they retained little power over the Anglo Irish at this point and the statutes didn't change much outside of the Pale and in fact it worse intentions with the hours and selves who are now viewed as second class citizens.

Speaker 1:          42:53          Edward died in 1377 with a situation in Ireland worsening his 10 year old grandson, Richard's second succeed at him. When Richard the second came of age, the Irish parliament again called on the king for help, fear and the loss of the entire island. At first, Richard's focus wasn't France fighting the hundred years war, but later in his reign he sought piece with the French. As for Ireland, however, he prepared an invasion to subdue the island by force. Ireland had become somewhat of an embarrassment to the English. It said that when Richard was suggested as an heir to the throne of the holy Roman Empire, they basically Martha concept of him being the savior of Europe from the Muslim Turks that the German's needed when he couldn't in their eyes even maintain rule of a primitive inferior nation. In 1394 Richard landed in Waterford bringing with them around 8,000 soldiers. He was the first English king to visit Ireland and almost two centuries.

Speaker 1:          43:51          He had a great deal of success and reinstating rural authority and try to reorganize administration of the island. Again, Richard success, your wasn't gained through many battles, but more through show of force and diplomacy. It seems to have worked, but when he left in 1395 orders started to unravel again and the country turned back to division and warfare. When he returned and 1399 things did not go as smoothly. In fact, it was a completely different outcome. This was a time when the throne of England became much more unstable and Richard's claim to it wasn't certain leading to a late response to what was going on in Ireland and poor coordination of his campaign. The Irish, along with some Anglo Irish, fought back against Richard this time, mostly through guerrilla warfare. During this unsuccessful campaign, Richard's rivals to the throne. Henry Bolingbroke took control of the throne from him, deposing him rather easily as he had become an unpopular king.

Speaker 1:          44:47          Bolingbroke became Henry the fourth Henry who had kicked Richard off throne was now not keen on leaving it for adventures in Ireland, nor did England really have the funds to do so. Leading to a continuation of the slow loss of English power in Ireland over the course of the 15th century as femme and caused by poor weather and plague hit. Yet again, English power in Ireland retracted to the Pale. The area around Dublin, which was firmly loyal to England. Anyone living beyond the Pale was considered a foreigner, including the Anglo Irish settlers and in the eyes of the English savage barbarians and the eyes of the Anglo Irish English power was collapsing and there's slow integration into Irish society now hastened as they had to fend for themselves and the eyes of the Irish. The foreign oppressor was retreating. Many returned back to England. The statutes of Kilkenny were irrelevant and Gaelic rule was beginning to thrive again.

Speaker 1:          45:43          As Irish king's began to rise to power as they had in the olden days still. However, there was no Irish unity to expedite this process. The Irish remained divided. In 1413 Henry was succeeded by Henry becoming Henry the fifth who would do little in Ireland focusing instead on France. When Henry died from dysentery, his infant son Henry was succeed. Him Becoming Henry the sixth Henry the sixth was a weak king who was viewed as incompetent and likely suffered from a strong degree of mental illness. He would lose the war in France, and more importantly, with loses thrown in a conflict that would make Ireland important to the English. Again, the war of the roses, which divided not only England but Arland as well. In 1449 Henry and his wife decided to position Richard of York a potential threat to thrown in Ireland. This wasn't merely a banishment as Richard was Earl of Ulster and had an interest in Ireland, but it was very much with the intention of getting him away from England.

Speaker 1:          46:46          Nevertheless, Richard made the most of his stay in Ireland befriending the O'Neals and the north as well as the kings have lunch there. This worried Henry as Richard was getting the support of the Irish kings who were potentially aid him in a conflict. Richard left Ireland and 1450 placing the Earl of Ormond James Butler in charge of the post. Unfortunately for him, however, the Earl died in 1452 and his son also named James a Lancastrian. The rival faction of the Yorkist succeeded him regardless. Richard had the majority of the Irish supporting him. He had effectively done what the English had long feared turned Ireland into a base from which a foreign invasion could come. In 1453 Richard had returned to England and took control of the throne while Henry was in the middle of a mental breakdown. His rule would not last. However, and while England came under the rule of Henry again, Ireland continued to recognize Richard as king, ignoring the rule of London, effectively making Ireland Independent.

Speaker 1:          47:49          Most of Ireland was with him, including primarily the Geraldine's of Munster and killed there. However, the butlers in particular, as I said, we're Lancastrians this divide would rock Ireland as it did England in 1460 Richard returned to England securing an agreement that he would succeed Henry to six but it didn't last and the work continued. Richard would die at the battle of Wakefield and be succeeded by his son Edward and his efforts who would later for us, Henry to exile in Scotland in Ireland events, we're culminating toward the battle of kill town where the Geraldine's and Butler's would face off, but York aside, when and the Butler's would never recover. Ensuring Geraldine power in Ireland, Thomas fits. James Fitzgerald was may head of the Irish government during this time. Accordingly. As the Yorkist Irish increase their wealth, he was much more of an Irishman then an Englishman and favorite traditional Irish culture and law except in Dublin where English rule was emphasized in 1466 he was removed from power by the O'Connors, however, and was later executed on false charges, which caused further conflict.

Speaker 1:          48:56          Unfortunately for the Irish, the Len Castro, Ian's once again gained power in England about the Irish remained Yorkist. It would not be long before the throne went back to the Yorkist again and Gerald became Earl of Kildare. Gerald would be known as Jared, more Garrett, the great in Ireland, effectively ruling as king in all but name under Gerald. The war and conflict continued in many parts. Ireland entered a short period of development, trade and relative peace. This began to change again in 1485 when Henry tutor a Lancastrian finally ended the war of the roses by securing throne.

Speaker 1:          49:38          He did not rule as a Len Castro in technically rather as a tutor, which was meant to be a house which unified it to. However, his physician still meant that he viewed the Irish who had opposed him with contempt. Nevertheless, he allowed Gerald to keep his position knowing it because unnecessary and taxing problems in Ireland if he did not. Despite this luck, Gerald and other Irish York is favored a suppose it error to the York. His throne Lambert signal who was in reality of fake, which Gerald probably new to replace Henry to seventh and actually invaded England to secure this Henry and crushed the invasion, but pardoned both Gerald and Lambert and Gerald, who indeed had the luck of the Irish returned to his post. Henry would later send an army into Ireland when the possibility of yet another threat from a fake air came and then 1492 Gerald was temporarily removed from office, though he likely wasn't involved in this plot is disloyalty in the past wasn't enough justification.

Speaker 1:          50:41          This period saw a resurgence of conflict with the Butler's making a grab for power. Now the Geraldine's had been to post this conflict, would concern Henry who sends an army into Ireland again and would put Sir Edward pointings in charge of administration to work alongside Gerald Ehrlich Codera who returned to power as the English realized he was a necessary evil in stable. The governing Ireland pointings would bring an end to any concept of Irish self rule. During the war of the roses, Arland had been making many of his own decisions and laws, but now it had to go through the approval of the king in England and could no longer be diversified locally. This would begin a reversal and England's gradual loss of Ireland until pointings Arland had gradually been slipping from England ever since the time of the Normans to the point at which it began operating independently in all but name.

Speaker 1:          51:36          Once again, when Henry the seventh died in 1509 his son Henry the eighth would further transform the relationship between England and Ireland, bringing the two nations closer together, but also driving the two peoples further apart. Henry the eighth is remembered as one of the most important monarchs in English history. Those certainly controversial. Henry's main legacy begins with the troubles of producing an error with his first wife Catherine of Aragon, Catherine fail to give Henry a male heir. After seven children, all of them died young except for their daughter. Mary Henry realized Katheryn wouldn't likely produce a male heir and thus wanted a divorce, which was a rare and often impossible concept in the 16th century, especially among the ability the pope with pressure from the Spanish who wanted their marriage with England and tact. Catherine was actually the daughter of Ferdinand and Isabella of Spain, denied it outright and thus Henry desperate for a male heir joins the Protestant reformation occurring in Europe and makes himself the head of his own Anglican church effectively breaking off from the Catholic Church.

Speaker 1:          52:46          In July of 1533 Henry was excommunicated and Catholic Europe, namely Spain, was beginning to view England as bitterly hostile. Henry's church will be founded in blood as he beheaded citizens who favored the pope officials who questioned his power and even some of his own wives. Catholicism was not to be tolerated. And with Ireland under pointings law, Arland was expected to follow through as well by the Irish would resist and saw this as an opportunity for rebellion. Rebellion would come under Thomas Fitzgerald, Earl of Kildare, known as silk and Thomas whose father had been imprisoned and killed by Henry Henry. Plan to execute Thomas as well. But Thomas took up arms and he declared Henry a heretic and launched three called a holy crusade against him. He was met by Sir William Skellington, who commanded a forest of around 2,300 well equipped men. Silken Thomas was defeated by skipping done. Thomas along with much of his family and scores of his supporters were executed by Henry shortly after the situation in Ireland remained unresolved, though the Pale naturally followed in step with Henry's movements.

Speaker 1:          53:57          But Ireland outside the pail was much less loyal and Catholicism remained firmly rooted. Henry's sent forces into Ireland to attempt to bring them more firmly under his rule under Lord Leonard Grey. But grey was opposed by a coalition of Irish lords known as the Geraldine leak orchestrated by menace. Uh, Donald, the League managed to even pillage the Pale but was eventually put down by Lord grey. In 1539, Henry, as was his style, later had lord grey executed and switch to a tactic of negotiation with the Irish. He encouraged them to surrender and swear loyalty to the crown and agree to follow English law, customs, and culture. In return, he would guarantee them their lands under English law, grant them in English title and insure them a place in Anglo Irish government. This offer applied to both Anglo, Irish and native Irish in an attempt to bring control to the whole country.

Speaker 1:          54:56          Ahmed, these changes to Irish society and increase English presence in rural Ireland. Henry, change this title from Lord of Ireland to King of Ireland. This was effectively much more than a change of title Ireland and England were now more clearly joined under a single monarch and the Irish Lords had a much more clearer legal position. Henry was eager to rural Ireland more closely and began a process that would begin to draw Arland closer to England after centuries of lackluster effort in Ireland by the English. Why would Henry begin turning things around? Well, from the war of the roses, you learned the importance of controlling Ireland. A hostile Ireland had been the base of not only Richard of York but later pretenders as well, and the Irish also nearly overthrew the English monarchy. Furthermore, Henry knew that a religious divide would threaten the stability and the Catholic Ireland what opened the door for the Catholic, French and Spanish to use the island against England.

Speaker 1:          55:55          Despite these efforts. However, as I said, Henry had little effect outside of the pail and many Irish nobility agreed to the surrender and regret policy as it's called and later ignored it. Henry died in 1547 he had laid claim to all of Ireland and begin a process which would link the two countries further, but ultimately failed as many monarchs had before him to brake control of the whole island. It would be his successors who achieve that. And the next video we'll look at the efforts of his short live son. Henry is daughters, Mary and Elizabeth and King James in Ireland in a crucial period in English history. We'll look at how Ireland functioned under English and eventually British rule and it's uneasy role and the empire which would come to dominate the world and later its effort to break off from that empire once and for all and become the nation it is today.

Speaker 1:          56:47          Or rather nations as the island remains divided for reasons we'll get into if you enjoyed this video. I have made others like it. We fully cover the history of England and the United States in a similar way, and I've done other documentaries on history such as the ones on the dark ages and the vikings. I've also done documentaries on subjects like the history of coffee, the science of dreams, the Science of aliens and terraforming, and the whole array of video is on other subjects and at of course invite you to come check them out on my channel to be updated on part two as well as the keep up with many videos like this coming up in the future.
