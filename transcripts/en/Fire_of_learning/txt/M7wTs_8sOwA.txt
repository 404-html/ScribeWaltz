Speaker 1:          00:00          Hello and welcome to fire of learning. Leonardo Da Vinci is considered one of the greatest poly mass to have ever lived. He wasn't accomplished artists, uh, brilliant scientists and engineers centuries ahead of his time and a man of thought he saw farther and wider than the people of his age and his accomplishments and work still fascinate us to this day and this video we're going to examine some pieces of advice. He left us throughout his life that were central to his mindsets and his achievement. Number 10 iron Russ. From this use, water loses its purity and stagnation even so to stagnation SAP, the vigor of the mind. The Vinci had a very powerful mind and like a muscle. He knew the importance of exercising it constantly. Basically daily, the Vinci was learning and creating, filling his notebooks with intricate designs and studying intensely the world around him. His greatest intellectual achievements were the products of hours upon hours spent in study and work.

Speaker 1:          00:57          Davinci was also quoted as saying the noblest pleasure is the joy of understanding. Number nine, simplicity is the ultimate sophistication. Davinci believes that the surest way to understand something was to be able to explain it simply and understand all of the basic concepts behind something. Having a very convoluted understanding of something confuses not only the person to whom you may be explaining something, but may even confuse you at times. Break it down to its essential oils. Number eight, anyone who conducts an argument by appealing to authority is not using their intelligence. They are using their memory closely related to this. Da Vinci was also quoted as saying, where there is shouting. There is no true knowledge. Davinci questioned the legitimacy of everything. Every power structure of the day. He believed it was open to his interpretation and in renaissance Italy there were plenty of authoritarian power structures to question.

Speaker 1:          01:51          He believed that the authority in dominance was not sufficient for their word to be followed, but someone said had to make sense logically and objectively. Number seven poor is the pupil who does not surpass the master. Davinci believed that it was not only important for a student to learn everything that they could from the teacher, but that a good student had the obligation of taking that knowledge and going further with it on their own. The Vinci was such a student. It is said that around the age of 20 when the Vinci's teacher growth, you observed the work he had done on an angel and a painting. He has said to a put down his brush and declared that he would never paint again. Davinci had surpassed him. Number six I have been impressed with the urgency of doing. Knowing is not enough. We must apply. Being willing is not enough.

Speaker 1:          02:39          We must do. The Vinci was the sort of person who has spent hours and hours and contemplation, exploration and design, but also learn very well the importance of implementing his ideas and applying his knowledge in the real world. Though his notebooks filled with designs and theories are amazing. Some of the Vinci's greatest moments we're in utilizing that knowledge. Number five. It had long since come to my attention that people of accomplishment rarely sat back and let things happen to them. They went out and happened to things. This is somewhat related to the thinking behind Number Six da Vinci had a desire to be an accomplished in the and in fact, he did accomplish many things in life and worked for and with many other great individuals of renaissance, Italy and fields like arc politics and even a little bit of war. But these opportunities didn't just come to him.

Speaker 1:          03:27          He went out and sought after them vigorously. Number four, how many emperors and how many princess have lived and died and no record of them remains yet they only sought to gain to minions, enriches that their fame may be everlasting. Davinci want it to be an accomplished person, but he was not after what he considered to be superficial fame and material accomplishment. He valued greatly achievements in science, philosophy and art, things that he believed would better himself and humanity. It was in his contributions and these fields that he would have a lasting effect on humanity and that was more important than any fame he could acquire. Number three, you can have no dominion greater or less than that of yourself. Davinci believes that the greatest battles were waged over one's internal weaknesses and that the greatest victory is where those over them. He was not a military or political leader.

Speaker 1:          04:18          He was a very startling individual and his life was spent on improving himself as much as possible. Number two, I have offended God and mankind because my work did not reach the quality it should have. This is not so much a piece of advice as it is a quote which represents how to Vinci thought. Davinci was very hard on himself as we said in number three. He was constantly seeking to better himself and to improve on everything he could. Being satisfied with yourself can lead to stagnation, which Inda Vinci's mind is a bad thing. His mind was always going further. He may have been a bit too hard on himself though and somewhat sadly. Those were actually his last words. However, don't be too sad because the Vinci also said, number one, as a well-spent day brings happy sleep. So well spent. Life brings happy death in many aspects we can See da Vinci was actually satisfied with many parts of his life.

Speaker 1:          05:10          He spoke these words in old age believing he had done well and live life very well and fully. That's isn't an inevitability for all of us, but whatever death is, Davinci believe that it won't be quite so bad if it has been proceeded by a rich and fulfilling life, and in fact, living such a life is all we can do in the face of it. There is of course more to learn from the Vinci, but these were just some of his best quotes. Let me know what you think of them in the comment section below.
