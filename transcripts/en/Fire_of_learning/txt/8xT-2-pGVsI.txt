Speaker 1:          00:01          If you grew up in an English speaking country like me, you probably heard multiple times by now that English is the hardest language to learn. I for one, believe this until I actually looked at how other languages work, and so in this video now we're going to compare English to other languages to see how hard it really is and see if truly English is the hardest language ever. Something to note though, before we again obviously yes, someone from like the Netherlands will be able to learn English much easier than someone from say China because something like Dutch is much closer to English then shiny. So we're going to look at it from the point of view of Tom, an alien who has never communicated with language before. Tom Has learned just about every human language and existence and he's learned just about everything there is to know about the world by watching every one of my freaking videos. So always prepared now to make an appropriate analysis. All right, so proponents for the idea that English is truly the hardest language to learn, come at it with English is the hardest because of its slaying.

Speaker 1:          01:07          Okay, no offense. But anyone who believes that English is hard because of it's slang has never studied another language. Well, let's just set this straight right now just about every language has slaying of some kind. Okay? So you could retort to this with, oh, but the British empire spread his language all over the world, creating a great variation and die electing such things. But Britain was not the only country with a global empire. The former lambs is Spain, Portugal, France, the Arab empire, ex Cetera, credit dialects, which are much more varied than something like American versus British English. Furthermore, dialects in something like Chinese can be in comprehensible to speakers of other dialects in Chinese. So this argument doesn't work because English is definitely not the king of dialects and slang. But what about when people dessert there? Desert and the desert, or when Buffalo, Buffalo, Buffalo, Buffalo, Buffalo, Buffalo, Buffalo, Buffalo.

Speaker 1:          02:06          Well, English can get pretty hardcore with its homophones, homonyms and homographs. Especially when you get into things like your in your there, they're in there, which many native English speakers don't seem to fully understand if for whatever reason, but it's not the only language with these types of things. So in comparison to other languages, homophones, homonyms and homographs are pretty much out of the question. Even though English can get kind of carried away with them. So while English isn't the only language with these things like homonyms spelling English words is comparatively a nightmare. Take A, for example, these words, rough cough plow though thought through and even lock their all pronounced differently yet all spelled the same. Furthermore, it really, vowel sounds in English aren't set in stone at all either vowels and diphthongs. Can you pronounce it very differently depending on the individual word.

Speaker 1:          03:00          Really when you look at it, the only rule in spelling pronunciation that seems to stick in English is I before e except after c. Ha, just kidding. Part of his vocabulary issue is because English took a lot from other languages. I'll make another video explaining this more in the future. But essentially English started out as a dramatic language that changed radically when the Vikings and then the French conquered England, for example. Sometimes the Anglo Saxons had their sicknesses, the vikings had illnesses and the French had diseases. And as these three languages kind of merged to become modern English, all of these words stuck around from each language. And we still have more synonyms for these words. And as time went on, English went out and borrowed hundreds of words from scores of other languages, meaning English may indeed have a larger vocabulary than many other languages. And other strange part of English is not a grammar issue technically, but it is necessary to prevent awkward speech adjective placement.

Speaker 1:          04:01          English speakers say a big old towering tree, not add towering old big tree. It's not grammatically incorrect to say the ladder at all, but English speakers find the former sue be less awkward and more natural. So there are some things that make English hard to learn. But what about English then is easy compared to other languages? Well, like I'm not no gendered nouns, sorry. It's just all the languages I've learned have gendered nouns that don't refer to anything that has a biology. What I mean to say is grammatically speaking tables in French, our female fields in Latin are male. Windows and Irish are female and girls and German are neuter. It really makes you appreciate the fact that gender in English is essentially just based off biology. Also, English syntax or word order is very strict and unchanging. This is a good thing in Latin Russian check Greek Arabic to some degree.

Speaker 1:          05:07          For example, they don't rely as much on word order and instead change the endings of words themselves slightly or inflect the words in order to structure sentences. English comparatively relies almost entirely on word order and therefore worrying about databse objects, adjectives, normatives, et cetera isn't as big of a deal and English as other languages. Looking more at grammar, English verb conjugation is basically pretty straight forward except in the past and perfect tenses which can get confusing and irregular. Exemplary Grotzia teachers taught, but preachers haven't prot they preached other than that English verb conjugation again is simple being uniform except an adding an s in the third person singular. So here we have it. Essentially Tom, the alien finds that English compared to all other languages is certainly hard in terms of spelling, pronouncing these spellings. English has a large vocabulary and some other aspects, but easy and several other aspects.

Speaker 1:          06:15          Namely no gendered nouns which have no biological sex. The straight forward syntax and a simple verb conjugation pattern. Some concepts you need to English like the fact that additives don't agree with their nouns and something like number can be viewed as either difficult or easy. Many other aspects which seem difficult in English are similar in other languages have not more difficult. So in conclusion, English is unique, but most people would probably not find it to be the hardest language to learn relative to all the world's languages. In fact, it's not really that hard. It's just, you know, it's just something you'd do. You now you say your own native language is the hardest language to learn. I've heard the French say it. I've heard the Germans say, the Chinese say the Japanese say it. Everybody thinks their own language is the hardest language to learn. Well, that's all for this video.
