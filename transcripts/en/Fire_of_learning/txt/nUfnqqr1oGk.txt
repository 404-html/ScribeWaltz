Speaker 1:          00:00          Hello and welcome to fire of learning. Today we're going to be discussing the fall of the Roman empire and the Dark Ages that subsequently and Gulfs Europe. Some questions we must address and this documentary are of course, what caused the mighty Roman Empire to collapse. What was life like in the dark ages? How dark? Where are they really? And if they were rather dark, what made them this way? What did people hold onto throughout them and how did Europe eventually climb out of them? This video today is made possible by the patriotic support of Chris Yates, so thank you again Chris. Now, then let's get to it. Rome, one 17 and the year of the death of the emperor Trajan who building on the efforts of his predecessors, which at this time spend over 800 years expanded the Roman Empire to its pinnacle. While there is still conflict on the borders, which other strong emperors who succeed Trajan that same century, such as Hadrian and Marcus Aurelius, well pursue the empire itself is still in an age of prosperity and relative peace known as Pax Romana, the Roman peace.

Speaker 1:          01:13          This is the glorious Roman Empire with which we are all familiar, though was still sand for centuries to come and while it was still in the middle of its golden age, the seeds of catastrophe will soon be planted. In one 77 the son of Marcus Aurelius comedies became emperor communists, broke the chain of strong emperors, which Rome had been enjoying that century. He was foolish, cowardly, inept, and outright sociopathic and insane. He ordered his guards to dance naked. He drank in public while dress like a woman. He had hundreds of female and male sex slaves, but what really angered the Roman elites known as patricians were things like human sacrifice, mutilating innocent people. And of course his participation in gladiator fights in these mock fights, he would often take on amputees and very brutal way. Just as an example of how he would fight during this rain, the Roman statesmen Cassius Deo would claim the competence because the Rome to descend from a kingdom of goal to one of rust and iron.

Speaker 1:          02:17          And indeed many historians agree that roams very slowed down. Fall begins with the reign of comedies. This went on for years until communist was finally killed by being strangled while bathing the Senate that pretended to love him while he was alive. Basically we decided to make him a public enemy once he died and tried to wipe out his memory altogether. Communists was not the first lunatic emperor. The most famous example in Roman history was of course Caligula who did things like make us horse a priest and ordered his soldiers to stab the see and collect seashells as war trophies when he declared war on the God Neptune. These things are of course funding to us 2000 years later but also very sad because these were quite clearly very mentally ill people who are placed in positions that allowed them to cause a lot of damage and they were to the Romans at the time.

Speaker 1:          03:09          Very scary. Obviously with Caligula the Romans had whether these types of things before, but there was not much relief following communist his death. Much more common than insane. Emperors and statesmen and Rome were corrupt and self serving ones. Though plenty of both kinds would come and as centuries, which followed the year of the five emperors would follow his reign. Person x, a military leader was made emperor by the Praetorian Guard, but then the guard killed him within three months. Didas you Leanna's succeeded him by buying the position actually, but then he was executed two months later. Civil war in Rome then broke out between two other claimants, Septimius Severus and per skinniest. Niger Septimius would win this war and rule for almost 18 years. But following him was a succession of other corrupt and inept emperors and in fact, corrupt and inept officials across the empire in general. So essentially, while the rule of communists and the year of the five emperors may have been an unusually desperate time for Rome, it did set the stage for other similar behaviors to follow.

Speaker 1:          04:15          Things did not improve in a third century as Rome entered. What is remembered as a crisis of the third century during this period, along with the aforementioned style of rural being commonplace, civil war ravaged and divided, the empire foreign armies attacked it. The economy took a major downfall. There was a 13 year plague and many other trouble is plagued Rome if people hadn't realized it before. They definitely were now starting to realize that Rome wasn't trouble and indeed people were concerned that they were facing a complete collapse of the empire, if not the end of the world. Intuity for Diocletian became emperor. Diocletian was a low status soldier born and modern day Croatia that rose to the ranks of the military and eventually became emperor by defeating other claimants. Diocletian was the first strong emperor Roman seen in quite awhile. You recognize that Rome was in major trouble and intended to reinvigorate the empire.

Speaker 1:          05:13          We've discussed already some of the things that were leading to and would eventually finally lead to Rome's collapse entirely foreign invasion, civil war and other domestic struggles for power, economic turmoil, et Cetera, or remedy. Diocletian would come to would be to split the empire between the East and the West. Rome was a giant empire even by today's standards, it stretched from Scotland to the Persian Gulf. Naturally, if the empire turned his attention toward one end of it, Scotland for example, then this would give someone in Egypt and opportunity to seize control for themselves or cause some kind of chaos in an age when word traveled slowly and people in armies much slower Diocletian that suggested that the empire remain one single Roman empire but be divided administratively between East and west with two emperors. Furthermore, Diocletian would break the 50 or so Roman provinces into over a hundred to ease administration of those as well.

Speaker 1:          06:12          These were generally successful or forums, at least temporarily. Many other reforms such as expanding the army, raising taxes to support that army, trying to stop inflation and persecuting Christians were not effective and many were in fact rather harmful. He had also tried to stop civil war as a means by which new emperor is came to power though after his reign. This method once again became commonplace. Admirably. Diocletian was the first Roman emperor to voluntarily resign living out his retirement, growing cabbages at his home until he died in three 11 eight while splitting the empire helped administratively financially it was a bad call. The western empire was less wealthy but had more financial burdens, namely supporting the military against numerous enemies and you know the constant warfare. Furthermore, as expansion halted over the late second and third centuries, the western economy which relied heavily on slave labor from conquered peoples started to suffer more as well.

Speaker 1:          07:12          With fever slaves obviously available. The wealth of the western empire became increasingly concentrated in the elite. Meanwhile, the lower classes struggled increasingly leading to a loss of cohesion and society. This along with other factors such as religious intolerance, specifically toward Jews and much more so the rising religion Christianity and what many Romans saw as a degradation of their values would lead to a breakdown of the Romans sense of community. It would be an emperor named Constantine the great that would attempt to solve many of these issues while fighting and yet another civil war for the throne and the early fourth century Constantine claim to have received one of the most important messages in history and a sky he saw across a Christian symbol and heard the words in Hawk signal. We get by this sign you shall conquer. He then claimed to have a dream in which he was visited by Christ where he was commanded a fight with the Cairo sign, another Christian symbol.

Speaker 1:          08:09          He did so and in the battle of the million bridge defeated his opponents army, which outnumber at him two to one. This would go down in history as one of the most important battles that were fought. Constantine would enter Rome victoriously and with later issue the edict of Milan along with the eastern emperor lie sinneas. This essentially allowed the worship of Christianity and all other religions across the empire, thus ending centuries of persecution. It also grants it back to Christian's all the lens which had been taken during Diocletian's persecution. Later Constantine with the feet lies sinneas in war and become emperor of both the West and the east. He was then found a new capital of the east, replaced a Greek pagan capital, which symbolize vision. He would build a city on top of an older city called Byzantium and named it after himself. Constantinople for the more constant team, would help Christians organize the Catholic church to its modern form.

Speaker 1:          09:07          Contrary to popular belief, Constantine did not immediately convert to Christianity. In fact, he spent most of his life officially as a pagan, sort of bouncing around with and working on both religions and drawing symbols from both of them and that sort of thing, but towards the end of his life, he would convert to Christianity. Becoming a first Christian emperor of Rome, thereby shocking much of the world. It would not be long, perhaps only 60 years or so after Constantine's death that most of Rome converted to Christianity as well. In fact, about 80% of the empire. This was a huge change and the effects of Constantine's rural are still with us today. Was Christianity, however beneficial to saving Rome or did it hasten its downfall? There is debate. Some scholars argue that it led to a breakdown of traditional Roman values. Others argued that traditional Roman values we're already breaking down and that Christianity gave Romans and new necessary focal point in their lives.

Speaker 1:          10:07          Regardless, however of the state religion, Rome still had other problems to face throughout the fourth century. The barbarians became a bigger and bigger problem. This along with increasing financial difficulties, more inept neps leadership after Constantine the great or read a vision of the empire and other problems started this spelled trouble for Rome. In the fourth century, barbarians began encroaching on Roman territory and settling and parts of it and Rome often lack the ability to remove them. Eventually Romans began integrating more and more barbarian soldiers into their armies to maintain their empire. These soldiers were cheaper but have less loyalty as well. Typically they had no actual concern for Rome itself, only for their barbarian commander and their people and of course only cared about their personal gain from being in the army in the late fourth and early fifth century. A group known as the hung's from the Eurasian steppes began moving Westburg displacing many dramatic tribes.

Speaker 1:          11:05          These dramatic tribes primarily gos in turn, began pushing into Rome putting more strain on Rome as well. The goths were brought in to the Roman empire, but were largely exploited and left to starve, causing them to rebel. In three 76 this was when Rome started the face serious, irreparable damage. The Romans would eventually win this war, but it would be a pyrrhic victory as the Romans had lost a considerable amount and couldn't valance the emperor of the east following this war would be to more civil wars, which the emperor Theodosius was struggled to win Theodosius die in three 95 the last, the ruler of both the east and western Roman empire his sons had and our [inaudible] would succeed him, but they were essentially also inept rulers getting the throne of a fractured empire. A gothic leader Alaric would lead another rebellion when the sons of the emperor Theodosius failed to give him much opportunity of advancement in the Roman army in which she was serving her.

Speaker 1:          12:05          Nori is failed to adequately respond to the situation, and it was a general Silico who was responsible for much of Rome's defense. As in fact, Alaric marched on the city of Rome itself still at co would defend Rome and other parts of the crumbling empire, but it would be excessively difficult. He pulled troops out of Britain and urged his soldiers to bring those slaves to fight with them, and four oh eight still a co a threat to her. Norris has power was executed, thus died. One of the last great Romans Alaric moved into Italy towards Rome. His forces were starving and he needed food. Though the Romans had little themselves in for 10 80 Alaric sack, the city of Rome, the great city had now fallen to barbarians. Many truly believed that the end of the world to come it is said that when the emperor Norris, who was living in the city of Ravenna heard the news, he cried out and yet it had just eaten from my hands.

Speaker 1:          13:01          He apparently thought that they meant his favorite chicken named the Roma was what had perished. Roma is, as I'm sure you can tell, the Latin word for Rome, and when he learned it was a city instead, he was relieved. This just goes to show how out of touch with reality high norjes really was and in fact, many Roman politicians and aristocrats were completely out of touch and it came at one of the worst possible times Alaric and his Visigoths banning the fine much food in Rome left for greener pastures. Throughout the next few decades of barbarian tribes began settling and Hispana per Tanya Gall, north Africa and other parts of the empire and the Romans were largely powerless to remove them and in fact negotiated ways to peacefully integrate them. Barbarian tribes, again, primarily Visigoths would ally themselves with Rome to Repel Attila the hun and his forces, but when he was given back and died unexpectedly and four 53 conflict was back on, ultimately, the barbarian forces in the Roman army known as the Federal Rati would unite under a leader of unknown ethnic background, possibly a hun named out Walker and four 76 auto Acker would overthrow the last Roman emperor, ironically named Romulus that year.

Speaker 1:          14:17          On September 4th and proclaim himself king of Italy. After over a thousand years, Rome had now officially collapsed Romulus. Only 16 at the time was allowed to quietly retire as Rome's light was extinguished. A key point to take from the fall of Rome was that it was not merely the result of barbarian invasion. It was firstly a combination of several factors that we can roam significantly economically. There were labor shortages from the lack of slave labor taxation increased heavily and the money was the valued from inflation for the more much this tax money went to fund the military and infrastructure was ignored. Administratively, the empire definitely over expanded and the division between the West and east, which temporarily helped ultimately would cause a two sides of grow apart leaving the western empire, which was less wealthy and had more enemies weakened. Furthermore, as if administration of the empire wasn't hard enough, it was being overseen by a number of corrupt and self-serving emperors and elites.

Speaker 1:          15:23          A large number of Roman emperors were assassinated by competitors. Others had to fight civil wars with the throne and others having achieved it behaved selfishly and competently or sometimes rather like click ula or communists. There was a similar situation of ineptitude and apathy in the Senate as well and furthermore, with the weakened government, the wealthier class was able to flee to the countryside and avoid taxation and participation in the state. We can even take into consideration the sudden shift and religion which had an impact on a sudden shift in values, beliefs and perspectives of the Roman people. Though, as I said at the debate, continues as to whether or not Christianity helped Rome or hastened it's fall. It was this society which the barbarian tribes that would ultimately cause roms. Downfall found a rather important distinction, however, was that they did not all invade room and a traditional sense.

Speaker 1:          16:16          Rome faced many invasions which crippled it, especially in later centuries, but many other incidents viewed as invasions. We're really revolts. The gothic wars of three to 76 for example, was a revolt on a taken by the Goss who had been, I don't want to say welcomed, but legally brought into the empire and allowed settle Alaric and not a slacker, weren't foreign invaders. They were both Latin speaking members of the Roman army, but they and their soldiers were at barbarian and origin and had no real connection to the empire beyond the superficial opportunity that they saw as migraines while fleeing from the huns and thus with the fall of the Roman Empire Europe. And while the Western world in general really falls into what historians call the early Middle Ages or the dark ages. But while the dark ages are painted as a regressive, unstable, and archaic, fearful, primitive time, the story of this age is very complicated.

Speaker 1:          17:14          Society did regress in many ways for many people living in the times. The world was comparatively darker than it had been in the past for reasons which we will discuss. But there was also a lot going on in his time. There were many important and great moments in history which took place in an age which historians may unfairly scoring sometimes in the decades following the fall of Rome. A number of things happen. Multiple success. We kingdoms arise in the all territories of the empire. This is a map of Europe in a year, 524 years after rung fell. As you can see, the kingdom's formed by the Visigoths, the Franks, the Ostrogoths, the Anglo Saxons, and the Burgundians are some of the most important kingdoms following Rome's fault. Most of the successor kingdoms are led by dramatic tribes whom the Romans considered barbarians. Now, there is a portrayal of these kingdoms being formed by savages, living in huts after having burned down Roman civilization, but many of these kingdoms actually kind of built on top of Rome.

Speaker 1:          18:14          They worked with Roman aristocracy. They were in many ways, Roman. A good example of this was out of whack or his kingdom of Italy. Actually auto wacker would naturally make an effort to depose of his Roman competitors, but the Roman Senate would actually continue to function during his reign and he drew on their support for a large amount of power and the state would gradually join the Ostrow gothic Kanombe as time went on, which in many ways was as well. Roman. Furthermore, many of these so called barbarians were as I discussed earlier, rather romanized. They spoke varieties of Latin, which was slowly evolve into other languages like French, Italian, and Spanish. Many followed the Roman religion of Christianity though for many it was area and Christianity, which was slightly different from the Catholic Christianity. A Rome, regardless the area and Christians in Italy still heavily respected a Catholic church centered in a city of Rome.

Speaker 1:          19:08          Many would say that Rome never truly fell all the way, but instead it survived. In the Latin speaking Catholic Church. During the five hundreds of Frank's began moving westward from modern day Belgium into the rest of modern France. Their leader, Clovis unified, the Frankish tribes effectively laying the foundations for the modern nation of France and the Merovingian Dynasty, which was to rule it. He ruled from a city called Paris, which would now serve as the capital of his people up to the modern day. Clovis also converted to Christianity becoming one of the first northern Germanic kings to do so, and he required that as subjects convert as well, laying the foundation for Catholicism to spread throughout Europe. As Europe became increasingly fragmented, times became harder. Life became, as is often said, nasty, brutish and short. In many ways, Christianity would be what gave the people of Europe unity and hope and its expansion from its Roman origins begins with these Germanic peoples adopting it.

Speaker 1:          20:08          The Franks, however, we're politically unable to form a large, powerful successor state because of inheritance laws. When Clovis died, his conquest were divided again between his four sons. Control of our power during such divisions across Europe would be the main cause for large amounts of conflict that marked the dark ages. In fact, in Merovingian France in particular, they were very constant civil wars. We may have a hard time imagining how this many civil wars can be erupting, but the concept of the state, as we understand it today, was not yet present in Europe in this period of history. The perspective of the time was that the country belonged essentially to the king while post the Roman Europe was modeled on the skeleton of the Roman Empire in important ways. As time passed, it became more and more clearly, really just a skeleton. Trade and infrastructure broke down relatively quickly and the past Mediterranean was a Roman Lake, which connected this Atlanta allowing trade to flourish.

Speaker 1:          21:09          Now the trade system's broke down as the roads fell into disuse and a countryside and sees became dangerous places, much of Europe return to the more localized agricultural societies that predated the Roman Empire. When Rome fell and warfare and plundering of cities became more constant lower class workers, both Roman and barbarian fled to the countryside to escape it and made deals with Roman land, owning aristocrats in exchange for work, Roman aristocrats, opera to house and defend them. A system which would evolve into the feudal systems that dominated medieval Europe. While we can debate and discuss the validity of the term dark ages. There are many very obviously dark features of this post Roman world. As a result of all the changes we just discussed, European societies became much smaller places throughout the centuries following Rome. Education naturally also fell with infrastructure and societal stability. Throughout much of the early ages, only about 1% of the population, mostly the clergy could read.

Speaker 1:          22:11          Life expectancy dropped. The population dropped, four started to grow back. I knew Europe became an eerily empty place. Roman ruins were often stripped for building supplies. The Colosseum in Rome served for a time as a landfill. The drop in education and the spreading of information allowed for distant lands to become mysteries again. People were regularly nervous about invaders or plunderers whom they didn't see coming. Arriving suddenly on the scene, the mysterious forest and countrysides, which were indeed dangerous places, also became the subjects of folktales and the early Middle Ages were a source of many myths and folktales and such things with which we are still familiar today. People told tales of Goblins, ferries, witches, sorcerers, the debt, etc. And many of those tails while they were viewed as unacceptable pagan myths by the dominant Catholic Church still lasted to stay in certain cases as original tails, but at least generally informed, you know, something like the Lord of the rings.

Speaker 1:          23:11          For example, while it was written in the 20th century, much of it was based off of dark age European mythology. Life was not all bad for these people's, but certainly as they lived among the ruins of Rome, even the most uneducated had an understanding that they were living in it, a graded world compared to the past. While these kingdoms work to succeed, Rome in the West and the east, the light of Rome continued to shine. The eastern Roman Empire did not fall with the West. Rather it evolved into the Byzantine Empire and though they were Greek speaking and much more eastern and western, they continue to view themselves as a Romans for the next thousand years, which Byzantium stood on August 1st five 27 the emperor Justinian came to the throne just sitting in the great as he came to be called, had very clear intentions, which he called run Novato and Patty the restoration of the empire.

Speaker 1:          24:05          At this point in history, Rome, he'd only been gone for about 50 years and Justinian intended to bring it back by reconquering Roman territory, loss of the barbarians after making a piece with the shop, the assassin had Persians there bribes. He turned his forces westward. The general Bellis Saris invaded the north African vandal lens and subdued them within a year, bringing them into the empire. Next, he turned his attention to the lens of the Ostrogoths. Unfortunately for him, he found much less success there. It took 20 years rather cause subdue them and it was a very debilitating campaign for both sides. And in the end though, Italy had been reconquered. Much of it was ruined in a conflict. The city of Rome, for example, had been sacked five times throughout these wars, firmly bringing them into the darkness of the Dark Ages along with this failure. And it was a considerable failure.

Speaker 1:          24:57          You have a cost Byzantium around 300,000 pounds of goal to rebuild Italy and war with the Persians, presumed just any, and also had a rude awakening and discovering that the societal structure of Rome had essentially fallen apart at his time. And that rebuilding it in the West after all this time was much more of a difficult prospect than he had realized though Byzantium Hell, Don's the territory's and it seemed, Rome was making a comeback of sorts. A plague then suddenly struck Byzantium known as the plague of Justinian. This plague was one of the worst in history. It killed 13% of the world's population or about half the population of the Byzantine Empire. Within a year. Imagine the effects of half the people you know, dying within a year. This is what just [inaudible] was facing on an empire wide scale and he himself was eventually struck with the plague.

Speaker 1:          25:49          He was one of the fortunate ones to survive it, but it left him scarred and he became increasingly erratic, tyrannical, and paranoid. Moreover though it left the empire scarred and though Justinian brought about great things with Byzantium culture, learning art, architecture like the highest Sophia, et Cetera, the empire was far too irreparably damaged by this plague to realistically rebuild the Roman Empire. It would not be long until Byzantium slowly started to lose a lens at a conquered as well as some of its own original lands as well. The lombards would start taking control of northern Italy and later the Persians, AVRs, Bulgarians, Slavs, et cetera. We'll close in on the empire as well. Byzantium gradually contracted in six 26 constant and Nopa was besieged by Persians AVRs. The Byzantines would win, but these wars were indeed fracturing. The empire. Ms Fracturing would leave the empire too weak to defend against what would be the greatest enemy of the Byzantine Empire is long and the six thirties Arabic followers of a new religion.

Speaker 1:          26:54          Islam began their quest for world empire. They found both Byzantium and Persia to weaken, to withstand the assaults and within a decade had spread and to Egypt, Iran and the border of Anatolia. By 780 the Umayyad caliphates stretched from North Africa to Afghanistan overtaking the Persians and most of Byzantium is non European territory. The Islamic powers founded by the Arabs and this time have a mixed place in history. In some ways, definitely they would come to be the enemies of European civilization and the enemies of what was left to Rome. In other ways, they were the successors of classical civilization in the east. The Islamic golden age began, while much of Europe existed in the aforementioned state in the eighth century, and the peoples of this region, Arabs, north Africans, Persians, et Cetera, took up science, history, linguistics, medicine, literature, philosophy, mathematics, and many other fields of education.

Speaker 1:          27:52          As Europe was still ruled on her frag method, successor states the Arabs began pushing into Hispana and closer towards Constantinople, eventually besieging it in seven 17 the siege of Constantinople was a failure, however, and that would leave the Arabs weekend and drink Hispana, however, was not a failure. Throughout the eighth century that we, my odds would move at the modern day, Spain and Portugal conquering the territories of the visit, gothic kingdom and beginning Islamic rule of the peninsula that would last for centuries. Meanwhile, in the Frankish empire, things were changing. The Merovingian dynasty was losing power and Muslim forces were moving in across the pier and ease into modern France standing in their way. However, with someone whom the Franks would call shock Martel, Martel was old French for Hammer Charles the hammer and the Mios gonna meet at the Battle of Tours on October 10th seven 32 there, the Franks would score a decisive victory over the Muslims killing 12,000 including the enemy commander while taking only 1000 or so losses.

Speaker 1:          28:56          The pope hailed Martell is having saved Europe from Muslim domination as they would never attempt to invade Europe from the Pyrenees again. Following this spousal Martel's power would grow enormously if a position is king, might seem a natural next step. However, he was ultimately unable and unwilling to take that position. Instead, he organized himself to hold power and rule from the background. While Theodoric of the Merovingian dynasty held the official title. This was again mainly due to the importance to Frank's placed on tradition and though the monarchy was much less powerful than it had been, there were still unwilling to do something such as overthrowing the monarchy. They felt it might anger God that it would be a front to their heritage and identity as a people et and Martell newest people would not support him. For this reason. It would be his son rather Pepin the short who would throw the Merovingians and begin the Carolingian dynasty in France.

Speaker 1:          29:51          He did this to the intervention of the only person of Frank's felt was hired in their king. The pope, the pope claimed pepins ascension to the throne was an act of God and few therefore contested it and turn Kim Pepin would give the church lens which will become the papal states known as the donation of Pepin. When Pepin died in seven 68 his son Charles would succeed him. Charles the first would become one of the most important rulers of the age earning the title of the great or as he is often called Charlemagne. Charlemagne is sometimes called potter. I wrote by the father of Europe because of his many efforts to reinvigorate and United Europe. After his brother died, he would unite his Frankish kingdom. He would then invade northern Italy, Germany, the Netherlands part of Eastern Europe, and even extend into the Balkans and part of Spain and above all he would have a lot of success in doing so.

Speaker 1:          30:44          He would fight all throughout his life to achieve this along with territorial and political aspirations. Charlemagne with the support and the pope was also heavily preoccupied with spreading Christianity. Charlemagne insisted that the Saxons of modern day Germany convert to Catholicism and those who refused were killed and one example 4,500 Saxons were executed and what is remembered as the massacre of her den. Accordingly, much of his empire rapidly became Christianized. Charlemagne sought not only to expand his empire but to enlighten it from within as well. And so he wasn't concerned only with bringing political and religious unity to Europe, but made efforts to restore Europe to the intellectuals. Social cultural, infrastructural power of the Roman days to the point at which his reign is often called the Carolinian renaissance. He would invite his empire into a number of counties, a constantly travel throughout Europe to make sure his subordinates were following his orders in an age when only around 1% of the population could read.

Speaker 1:          31:48          Charlemagne insisted education was a key to revitalizing Europe. He himself learned how to read and demanded it of other officials and statesman. He built schools across the continent which increased educational opportunities not only for the wealthy, but even the lower classes as well. This fire of learning, which spread throughout Europe would help the continent restore trade and infrastructure. The Unity Charlemagne had achieved for the more allowed for disinterested in such things to be realistic again, and the roads were prioritized and guarded. Charlemagne had United much of Europe Christianize. It brought education and learning to it, rebuilt its infrastructure and on the whole improved life for those within his nation. On Christmas Day and the year 800 a Charlemagne knelt at the altar to pray at mass in Saint Peter's Pope Leo, the third place a crown on his head and proclaimed him emperor of Rome. There is debate actually about whether or not Charlemagne knew that this was going to happen.

Speaker 1:          32:50          He later claimed that if he did know, he wouldn't have even gone into the church, but most historians find it hard to believe that he had no idea that this was going to happen. And in fact, he didn't exactly dislike the title. Considering in official documents, he preferred to be styled Carlis Serani seamless. I ghost this ideo, not this magnus [inaudible] imperium, meaning Charles Most Serene, Augustus crowned by God the great peaceful emperor ruling the Roman Empire, as one might expect. The Byzantines were not very fun of this. They tended to regard western Europeans as uneducated on civilized barbarian be surfers, and more importantly, the empress. Irene, a Byzantium considered herself. There were live Rome, not this Frankish barbarian Charlemagne. Now this was much more than just a petty debate over a title. It was another example of strain between Byzantium and the Catholic Church. This, along with conflict over land claims in Italy would lead to a war between Byzantium and Charlemagne, but it would end with land agreements and the Byzantines recognizing Charlemagne as emperor, though not exactly emperor of Rome.

Speaker 1:          34:03          As time went on, however, the divide between east and West would only deepen what seemed like Europe was beginning. A streak of recovery, external and internal forces will begin to wreak havoc on Trello means empire. Western Europe was about to being close upon on three sides from the south Islamic north African pirates who begin rating and plundering southern Europe from the east. A terrifying wave of nomadic warriors from Asia known as a Magyars would begin pushing in and from the north, perhaps the most fearsome of all, a group of pagans, Scandinavian Raiders, known as the Vikings, would seek plunder and opportunity in Europe. Charlemagne would go to war with a Danish Vikings and eight oh wait, but made peace and eight 11 I've done an in depth documentary on the vikings already on my channel as a matter of fact, but essentially the vikings were, as I said, a group of Scandinavian Raiders from Modern Day Denmark, Sweden and Norway that is send it on Europe in the late 18th century on June 8th seven 93 on an island known as Linda's foreign and the Kingdom of Northumbria and Monterey England, a group of Raiders, assaulted and undefended Abby slaughtering and slaving anyone in their way.

Speaker 1:          35:15          This was not necessarily the first viking rate in history, but it is perhaps the most notable as it marked the beginning of the Viking age terror spread throughout Europe of the brutal Northmen. Why the Vikings came is still a matter of debate. The vikings were, as I said, Pagans and the peg and Saxons who had been slaughtered by Charlemagne earlier. We're just south of Denmark, so they may have felt concerned about the violence spread of Christianity and they certainly as a result did not like to Frank's. There was also perhaps a population boom at this time in Scandinavia and there were an excess number of landless men as a result, and of course it's a constant theme throughout his Sri that large numbers of landless jobless young men tend to go out and cause trouble, especially when you factor in that there was potentially a shortage of females in the region because of female infanticide at birth.

Speaker 1:          36:10          May Norris at the time wanted their firstborn is to be males. A main factor, however, was likely simply because they could. Europe was becoming wealthier at this time and opportunity for plunder started displaying itself, especially on coastal cities and cities along rivers. The Vikings, through their advanced naval technology, exploited this opportunity attacking coast and even sailing up rivers with large groups of men, namely with the long boat design, which was unheard of prior to this point. The sailing abilities of the vikings meant simply nowhere was safe. They could sail inland France and Germany. They could sail to distant lands going as far as North Africa and Byzantium, but their favorite target was right next to home. The British isles as islands. Very few locations on the British isles where more than just a few days march from the sea and as the Viking age progressed, there would be more and more Viking influence in Britain and Ireland.

Speaker 1:          37:08          A few years later in eight 14 in the face of all this chaos, Charlemagne died at the age of 71 Charlemagne had had four sons and throughout his life expected he would have to divide his empire among them. Unfortunately for him, but fortunately for the Carolingian Empire, only one of them, Louis outlived him and the empire pass to him. However, regardless, much of Louise Rain was marked by civil war and conflict and when he died his empire was divided among his sons in a year, eight 43 three years after his death and the west of territory would be ruled by Charles and the East Louie and in the center. Loath are these divisions would form the basis of France, Germany, and the low countries in such places that remained to this day that a vision between these kings only encourage the enemies of Christian Europe. The Vikings would increase their rates, Muslims would increase their plundering.

Speaker 1:          38:02          Taking slaves in Luton such things as well, and the Magyars closed in in some places. People were hit by all three of these foes in such times when the central political figures of Europe would invited and wore, people would turn to the protection of the local Nobel's marking some of the beginnings of standard European feudalism. In eight 65 the vikings took a new step to their approach. A great army of Vikings landed on the coast of North Umbria and Anglo Saxon Kingdom and Modern Day England known to the Anglo Saxons as the great heathen army. They did not come to raid, but in fact to settle gradually absorbing lands in England, starting with the city of York, which they called the orvick. Gradually the Anglo Saxon lands would fall to the Dane law. Standing against him, however, was the ruler of the Kingdom of Wessex in southern England named Alfred. In time, he would become to known as the great.

Speaker 1:          38:58          He would spend much of his reign in conflict with the Vikings, but he would say the last free kingdoms of England from Viking role, though much of the island would remain under Norse rural for centuries with Alfred at the head of these kingdoms, he was style himself, not king of Wessex, but instead King of England laying the foundations for things that come in the late 19th and early 10th centuries, the Magyars who begin to form a kingdom and central eastern Europe, a nation which would come to be known as Hungary. This kingdom would plunder Europe for decades to come invading both the western and eastern world and becoming a specific nuisance to the East Franks as well as the Bulgarians and the Byzantines and nine 55 however, as the Magyars pressed further into lens that will become Germany, the king auto, the first would oppose them. He met them at the battle of Lek felled that year under autos command was a new type of soldier, heavy cavalry, an important force in standing up against a horse warriors.

Speaker 1:          39:57          The Magyars, this heavy cavalry would go on to form the foundation of Medieval Knights. Auto would win, repelling the Hungarians and in the eyes of Catholic Europe being an offender of Christendom as auto continued to work to unite the German tribes and expand his empire, he will be crowned in a similar manner as Charlemagne by the pope being titled, Holy Roman Emperor. Thus the holy Roman empire was born. Meanwhile, the Vikings often regarded as destroyers of Europe. We're in many other ways giving birth to parts of it and going far beyond what their opponents were doing. Many would integrate into European societies and convert to Catholicism in France. In order to appease the vikings, the king would give them land on the northern part of the country, which would come to be known as a land of the north men or Normandy. These Normans, after integrating with a French, would go on to conquer England a century later and lay the foundations for the English monarchy.

Speaker 1:          40:55          They're having the greatest naval technology in Europe. They would go on to explore and settled distant lands reaching Iceland, Greenland, and even North America. Discovering it's centuries before Columbus and eastern Europe. The Vikings would come to claim territory and rule a Slavic people as an ability. These vikings known as the reus would lay the foundations for modern Russia, even as far east as Byzantium, the emperor of Constantinople observing their military prowess hired them to be as personal bodyguard known as the Bahrainian Card. Ironically the vikings who brought such darkness in Europe in the what helped bring it out of that darkness into the Higher Middle Ages which followed ultimately. However, the truly most unifying force in medieval Europe for perhaps good and bad was Christianity and the Catholic Church. The Catholic Church would stamp out ideas which contradicted his doctrine, but it would also be responsible for encouraging a return of education to Europe.

Speaker 1:          41:54          The church would heavily persecute those who did not fall into the line of thought, but oftentimes that meant persecuting rapists, thieves, murderers and other nefarious people. Leaders would be held under a degree of rule from the Catholic church, which was an plenty of circumstances, a self interested organization. The Catholic Church was also instrumental in restricting self interested rulers and ability and held them to a standard of decency and morality. The Catholic Church would encourage the code of chivalry among Europeans, which turned the medieval knight from a barbarian thug into a servant of piety and morality. We can debate the effects that religion and especially religious organizations have on people, especially in times like the dark ages, and we can even call into question how much good and bad that the Catholic Church did in his time was really in the name of religion or if it was out of his self interested plot.

Speaker 1:          42:47          But in the end, I think it would be fair to say that the Catholic Church played a significant role of bringing Europe out of the dark ages, even if that role was not wholly good or bad in the eyes of some historians, Europe would not return to the same level of appreciation and dignity until the renaissance. But around the beginning of the 11th century, the dark age of the Medieval world was coming to a close trade and infrastructure where we're turning to former grander art and architecture. Took off modern nation states, notably England, France, Poland in Denmark, saw their foundations in his time and with those nations can the concept of the state and the power which they would come to wield the first crusades, would reintroduce Europe to the intellectual achievements of antiquity and the Islamic golden age, which were crucial in pulling Europe from the Middle Ages all together and into the modern world.

Speaker 1:          43:42          The modern world, which by the 11th and 12th centuries was beginning to come into sight. As for the Roman Empire, it would never truly rise again. The Byzantine Empire would survive until the 15th century when Constantinople was finally captured by the Muslim Ottoman Empire in Europe, many from the holy Roman Empire to Napoleonic France to Mussolini's, Italy would claim to be the return of the Roman Empire. And though none would ever be truly Roman, the legacy of the Romans would last up to the modern day. But while Rome laid the foundations for much of Europe and significant parts of the world, in fact, we should not forget that many other important foundations lie in the efforts of the people who push through and survived. A very dark age at this time. I'd like to thank Jonathan Trillo for is Patriot and support.
