Speaker 1:          00:00          Hello and welcome to fire of learning. In the last video, we ended with the end of the civil war. The period following the civil war is often called the reconstruction era, referring as you might expect to the reconstruction of the union following it's divide while the south was being reintegrated into the nation and rebuilt the north and the West would take off and industry commerce and technological development, transcontinental railroads enabled quicker passage, the western parts of the nation. It once took six months to reach California from New York. Now it took only a week as settlers moved into the west. However, they encroached further on native American territory leading to considerable amounts of conflict with them, which would last until the 1890s many natives who were not killed and resistance replaced on reservations and some attempts to integrate them were made. Many people will be employed as well and the industries that would rule the east of the nation and turn the United States into the greatest industrial power in the world.

Speaker 1:          00:57          This age would be the rise of corporations in America and many at the time felt that corporations were interfering with the nation's down to Earth, democratic nature. What was seen as corruption on the part of the corporations would lead to labor organizations and unions such as in Knights of labor in 1869 strikes and protests would grow more frequent and such movements would help characterize the age as well as factories, corporations and centers of industry, schools, hospitals, museums, and centers of art and culture in such things would pop up across the nation. Science would also prosper here with scientists such as Nikola Tesla, Alexander Graham Bell and Thomas Edison Active Alaska will be purchased in 1867 in a purchase remarked as Seward's folly, famous American author, Mark Twain would coined a term for the 1870s to the early 20th century. The gilded age as a typical name representing social upheaval with a silver lining.

Speaker 1:          01:51          Both the industries in the east and expansion westward would be undertaking my huge numbers of immigrants pouring into the country. According to the US Census Bureau, from the end of the civil war to the start of World War, one 28 million immigrants would pour into the nation, almost all from Europe, some from British Canada, Quebec, and some from Asia as well. Though Asians were typically more unwelcomed than other European groups. In 1880 the population of the u s had 50 million. As Jim crow laws began reversing their rights of blacks in the south. The women's suffrage movement would rise up in this era. During this time, American foreign policy would change as well. Prior to this, the United States have been somewhat isolationists. We see several examples of what we would call imperialism. The obvious example is the decades of conquest against native Americans, but also of course the Mexican American war and the Monroe doctrine and things of that nature, but now with the continent, very much under American control, American politicians, businessmen and military leaders turn their sights on the international theater.

Speaker 1:          02:51          It's often debated whether or not America had an empire, mostly because it did an act exactly similarly to the European empires across the world, mostly because it had plenty of opportunity in his home region. But while the word empire is more contested prior to these decades, if it is applicable at all, which I encourage you to decide for yourself, it very likely begins here with a Spanish American war. During the 1870s up through the 1890s nearby Cuba had been pushing for independence in an age where an American Trey expand that across the world. American businessmen pushing to expand their markets into the region and fueled newspapers, highlighting and exaggerating Spanish atrocities on the island against the rebels. In 1898 when an American ship in Havana harbor called the USS Maine exploded, the Spanish army was immediately blamed in newspapers, blew up the issue across a nation, though the Spanish were likely not responsible, this would force the government, which was somewhat unwilling into the Spanish American war.

Speaker 1:          03:49          During this war which lasted only three months, Cuba was liberated and the Philippines, Puerto Rico and Guam were annexed. The conflict would later break out between the U S and Philippines and it'll become independent in 1946 also in 1898 Hawaii would be annexed following the overthrowing of the Hawaiian Queen, the progressive era named after the progressive movement, which focused on tackling social labor and political inequalities arose in the 1890s journalists who focused on the corruption and everything from the politics of the day to the unsanitary conditions of the meatpacking industry. We're referred to as muckrakers labor reforms, increases in sanitation and social movements would intensify in a Sarah Spanish American war veteran Theodore Roosevelt, who had become presidents after the assassination of William Mckinley became president in 1901 and would be a leading progressive president doing things such as establishing the FDA and expanding national parks. He would continue an imperialist foreign policy. However, expanding the power of American military, focusing on foreign threats and laying the foundations for the Panama Canal to be built in 19 no wait, the Ford model t would be introduced on the market regarded as the first affordable car.

Speaker 1:          04:59          It would revolutionize American transportation. In 1912 Arizona will become a state becoming a final state and the continuous United States, the main continent had now been successfully won in 1914 rising political conflict in Europe would eventually explode into the first world war. The United States, while very much affected by the conflict chose at first to stay out of European affairs. However much the government and populous favor of the allied side public opinion began to shift increasingly toward war. When German submarines fired on and sank the Lusitania carrying American civilian passengers, the German stated that they would not repeat the incident, though this eventually proved to not be true and the Germans fired on any ships approaching Britain. Later, a message from the German government, the Mexican government known as the Zimmerman telegram and forming the Mexican government, that if they were to declare war on the United States, they will be supported by the Germans and their reconquest of lands lost during the war was discovered by the United States and this mixed with unofficial German hostility would lead to American entry into the war.

Speaker 1:          06:04          In April of 1917 under president Woodrow Wilson and truce begin arriving in 1918 the United States military was still rather small and ill equipped as it had not been involved in a major war since the civil war. American industry now turn toward weaponry and the draft was started while the war was in its final parts of fresh American troops in sudden surplus of supplies and efforts are placed to withdrawing Russians and help secure the eventual allied victory. A year later on November 11th, 1918 the central powers surrendered to the allied forces. The war would officially be ended with a treaty of Versailles where the victorious nations of Britain, France, and the United States along with many other nations negotiated the terms of the treaty at the palace of Versailles in France, Germany. However, it was not included in the negotiations and would essentially be forced to accept the terms, namely land loss, reduction of their military power, demands of operations, and assuming responsibility for the outbreak of the war.

Speaker 1:          07:04          Though the war's beginning have blamed on all sides of Europe. Germany was outrage, but the United States was also a post and most of these conditions and refuse to sign the treaty. Wilson's main intentions were to repair the damage and avoid another war, namely with things like the formation of a League of nations, but Congress would not approve of the treaty or the entry into the League of nations, which would create tension for years to come during world war one, feminism in the United States and become active again. Generally, it hadn't felt that if only men could participate in war is only mentioned vote. However, female efforts at home and overseas a returned many of these conceptions and in 1919 the 19th amendment was passed, giving women the right to vote following the war. The United States would return to what some would call it unilateralism and others. As I've said, isolationism basically focusing on domestic affairs and keeping a distance from foreign conflicts and alliances and such.

Speaker 1:          07:56          The economy would grow from industry and trade, which is why the 1920s are often called the roaring twenties some of this business was illegal. However, as shortly before the 18th amendment was passed, which banned the sale and transportation of alcohol inspired by groups of Lutheran and seeking to edit things like alcoholism, family violence, and other places, society that they felt alcohol created. Prohibition was gritty, protested and increased organized crime throughout the nation. While decreasing tax revenue, it would not be repealed until 1933 the error also saw a number of social, cultural and technological reforms. Jazz music became popular. Social Roles, namely those of women began to change. Automobiles, aviation, the first movies, telephones, radio, the modern organization of sports. The media's focus on unimportant celebrities, many of these kinds of things which are very much still a part of American culture and in fact the western culture have their origins in this time period.

Speaker 1:          08:53          The roaring twenties however, would not last at the end of the decade. On October 29th, 1929 the stock market crashed. This along with a number of other economic factors would mark the beginning of what is called the Great Depression. An era of worldwide increases in unemployment and poverty and decreases in GDP and trade. In the United States, industrial production fell 46% wholesale prices, 32% foreign trade is 70% and unemployment increased 607% or from about 3% of the population before the depression to 25% of the population. At the end of it, President Herbert Hoover attempted to reinvigorate the American economy with government influence and the economy, notably the construction of public buildings, the most famous of which is the Hoover dam. However, he would fail and much of his efforts, but in 1932 president Franklin d Roosevelt was elected after promising Americans a new deal is early administration is important and that it marked much of the beginning of the modern American government's influence in society as he attempted to turn the great depression around.

Speaker 1:          09:56          Through creating a number of new government agencies is subsidizing farmers, saving the banks from collapse, lowering government salaries, switching off from the gold standard and expanding many labor programs across the country. He would indeed be instrumental and revitalizing much of the country and his fireside chats. Regular radio broadcast the liver to the public. He would share many of his ideas and plans for the country. In the late 1930s however, Roosevelt took more of a role in foreign policy as was feared by many. The recited treaty had, for all intents and purposes, failed and an anger. Germany was rising under the leadership of Adolph Hitler. War once again seems eminent on the continent. It did indeed come when Germany invaded Poland in 1939 and France and Britain declared war when France was beaten by Germany much more quickly than was expected. Concern grew in the United States have a serious conflict and the government did lose much of its intention to remain isolated from the conflict.

Speaker 1:          10:50          The United States did not enter the war, but it did unofficially take a side with the allied nations of Britain, the Soviet Union, the French Resistance in China against Germany, Japan, and Italy. By setting them supplies and arms. In 1941 Japan was stale mating with the Chinese, but was looking to expand into other regions as well, most notably Southeast Asia. However, Southeast Asia had been colonized predominantly by the British and the United States. Recall, of course, that the Philippines, we're essentially an American colony annex. Following the Spanish American war, the Japanese knew that it could not match the British and American naval support, but it nevertheless felt a pressure to expand into their lens. So a decided instead to attempt to wipe out the allied naval bases in the region before war, which they saw as inevitable began on December 7th, 1941 date, which President Roosevelt said with live in infamy, the Japanese attack, the American naval base at Pearl Harbor.

Speaker 1:          11:42          The United States now had entered into a war against Japan and subsequently Hitler declared war on the US. While Roosevelt had walked to join the war in some manner he now has from the American people, which followed from the attack and the u s began to mobilize. The attack on Pearl Harbor was much less of a victory than was intended, but the Japanese began successfully assaulting much of Asia taking American and British territory rapidly extending all the way up to the borders of British India and Australia. Even support on the allied side now increased considerably with the direct American intervention in the war. The U s would invade North Africa along with the British in June of 1942 the US would win the battle of midway in the Pacific against Japan dealing a devastating blows their navy. In September of that year, the u s would engage the Japanese at Guadalcanal and would win an early 1943 the war was beginning to turn around in 1943 in Europe as well as the Soviet Union was beginning to repel German advances.

Speaker 1:          12:41          Italians and Germans surrendered in North Africa in May and the allies invaded mainland Italy in September. The others came to a standstill even though many Italians were not sympathetic to the allies. The allies had planned for an alternative routes into Europe through northern France. The invasion, which was the largest seaborne invasion in history, came on June 6th, 1944 often referred to as d day and Normandy, France. Five key beaches were selected by the allies to obtain in the effort nickname that Utah and Omaha, which the Americans we focus on the British at Golden Sword and the Canadians at Juno, the ranks we bolstered by soldiers from many other countries as well, including the French Resistance, Australians checks, Norwegians, Poles, and dames leading the Americans here was General Dwight d Eisenhower. The Germans were rather unprepared for this assault as they were expecting it to come on. Kallai around 10,000 people would die in these battles, but they were successful allied victory as a now how to foot hold on the continent and the east general Douglas Macarthur pushed and closer toward mainland Japan throughout the rest of 1944 and into 1945 the allies pushed and had Germany, Britain, America, Canada, and their allies from the west with the Soviet Union from the east with the Soviets and circling Berlin Germany's capital.

Speaker 1:          13:58          Hitler committed suicide on April 30th, 1945 and his successor made peace despite Hitler's wishes. It was made official on May 7th, 1945 now known as the e or a victory in Europe Day. The European theater had been one, but the eastern theater spearheaded primarily by the United States was still active. The Japanese we're losing, but we're still fiercely resisting. The allies. Fear to land invasion of Japan would be brutal, costly, and drawn up, possibly lasting for years. However, the United States had another plan that same year. The first successful atomic bomb test had been had taken place in New Mexico. Now the Americans intended to use it on Japan. The decision fell under the presidency of Harry s Truman, as Roosevelt had died on April 12th of that year while serving his fourth term, it was approved and the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki were bombed on August 6th and ninth in 1945 the month the Japanese surrendered and the war had come to a close.

Speaker 1:          14:54          The war had claimed the lives of around 60 million people, perhaps even up to 80 million if you include the seeds and famines caused by the war. Many were soldiers, many were civilian casualties. Some civilians around 11 million or so were specific targets. As a Nazi. He's intended to rid Germany of groups. They considered undesirable or troublesome through genocide, known as a holocaust, most literally 6 million Jews, but also homosexuals, the mentally handicapped Gypsies, communists and sterilize other groups like blacks. World War II fundamentally change the United States. It had pulled the nation out of the Great Depression with a large increase in GDP and ended unemployment and had modernize the American military, but many changes were unprecedented in all of American history. The United States how to merge to replace the Europeans as a world power and that had come out of the isolation and general self sufficiency, which which the founding fathers had intended for the nation and jumped into being active in the entire world theater a change which lasts to this day.

Speaker 1:          15:54          Furthermore, though the US had lost around 400,000 soldiers in the war, the mainland was essentially unraveled by conflict. Unlike much of Europe and Asia allowing for more unimpeded growth, United States was not the only world power to emerge from the fight. However, the Soviet Union though it had faced horrifying destruction and his homeland and major losses. Pet also merged as a dominant world power and the strain between the two was evident even before the war was over. The two sides, the US letting one and the USSR, the other forum to not merely at a geopolitical tensions and interests, but economic and ideological tensions as well. And the earlier parts of the 20th century, Russia had been overthrown by communist revolution. The United States had opposed this revolution from beginning and much of the capitalist west were hostile toward it. Up to this time period. The USSR had been somewhat isolationist up to this point as well though not as much.

Speaker 1:          16:47          However, it now saw an opportunity to spread its ideology across the globe as well. The newly formed United Nations was created with an intent to try to prevent a certain what war which with the Soviet and American scoring up did not seem like such an impossibility. And the era in which such a devastating conflict loom that's a threat is known as the Cold War era. Both sides claim to be fighting for freedom, liberation and overall good and battles to come. But for now they were busy dividing Europe. Debate emerged over how to divide posts. Nazi Europe. The Soviets were keen on maintaining the lands which they had occupied following the war. While the western side was intent on keeping communism from spreading and war torn nations work again, a foothold, a policy known as containment. This division has split Germany between East and West as well as the capital of Berlin itself.

Speaker 1:          17:37          The United States eventually adopted the Marshall Plan, which serves to provide resources and funds to fight against communists takeovers and help reconstruct Europe and Japan at home as well. There was concern of communist takeover and anticommunist propaganda became increased as a red scare took root in a nation. In 1949 the two sides became more clearly differentiated when and respond to the Warsaw Pact created by the Soviet Union. The U s helps found NATO or the North Atlantic Treaty Organization between these two nations exist a metaphorical wall or as Winston Churchill described it in iron curtain. As the Soviets tested their first nuclear weapon that same year, it became clearer that any conflict that would emerge directly between the two nations would be even more to Shuck Div. In the Second World War, possibly even as scientists and military experts came to conclude a threat to the human species itself. The situation of the world was changing. The old European empires of Britain, France, Germany, Portugal, Spain, et cetera.

Speaker 1:          18:36          We're now ending as new nations rose up and revolutions or grunted freedoms peacefully. The United States and Soviet Union both attempted to influence these new nations and wind them to their side and defining aspect of the Cold War. In the 1950s many conflicts would emerge from the cold war. The Korean War was one of the first following World War II who Korea was liberated from Japan, but also to vita between the USSR and the US and emerged as to separate nations of north and South Korea. Neither side was indeed content on remaining separate nations and eventually war broke out between them. In 1950 the north was supported by the USSR and eventually more directly by the newly formed Communist. People's Republic of China. The South was supported by the United Nations and send soldiers into Korea on South Korea's behalf consisting primarily of American soldiers. However, when the Chinese entered the war on Korea side, the two sides eventually reached a stalemate and President Eisenhower was eager to make peace, which they did in 1953 vote.

Speaker 1:          19:36          A vision remains to this day. In 1960 John F. Kennedy was elected as president. In 1961 the CIA attempted to overthrow the Cuban dictator, Fidel Castro, using Cuban exiles in what is known as the Bay of Pigs invasion. But Castro likely knew the invasion was coming and defeated us backed forces and solidify the country against the western powers. Cuba's relations with the Soviet Union would continue to grow, which worried many Americans as Cuba is a mere 90 miles from the coast of Florida. The following year, the Soviets intended to send nuclear missiles to Cuba, but President Kennedy and Soviet leader, Nikita Khrushchev agreed to remove nuclear missiles from Cuban Turkey, avoiding an escalation to what could become a third world war known as a Cuban missile crisis. In 1957 a new conflict emerged from the cold war, though not one of arms and soldiers, but of technology and science. The space race, the space race was a competition to explore space which was rooted and the potential that technology would extend conflict into outer space and that the first nation to get a foothold in this new theater would have an advantage in near succumb.

Speaker 1:          20:42          The Soviet Union would put the first satellite in this space in 1957 known as Sputnik and in 1961 would put the first human in his space, Uri Gaga Green. However, in 1969 in the United States with land, the first person on the moon and in fact a whole nother world, Neil Armstrong, however, the 1967 space treaty prohibited land claims or the establishment of military bases on the moon or other celestial bodies. Once the solar system was designated for scientific study alone, the US and Russia began to cool their efforts into space and no nation ever did anything of equivalent magnitude in space. Again, in 1964 following the Gulf of Tonkin incident, two incidents in which was claimed that Vietnamese ships had fired. I'm the U S has Maddix, although there is uncertain evidence that this actually happened. The specialty, the second attack though possibly the first as well, the United States began taking a more direct role in another war raging from the aftermath of European decolonization.

Speaker 1:          21:39          Civil war had been raging there since at least 1955 following liberation from France in Vietnam, socialists back northerners were engaged in conflict against the NATO back south. The war waged on into the 70s and may protest against if utility and lack of necessity for the war erupted in the United States, which put pressure on the government to limit participation in it. Though it was considered vital by the government and much of the population to stop the spread of communism in Southeast Asia and the u s pressed hard dropping more bombs in Vietnam then were used in all of World War II and utilizing chemical weapons such as agent orange. During this time, the public was protesting many other things besides increased American military intervention across the world. Many social movements, particularly those concern the rights of African Americans, women and other minorities sprang up and notable figure from this time period was Dr. Martin Luther King Jr who sought to end institutionalized racism against African Americans and achieve complete equal status.

Speaker 1:          22:39          This was essentially achieved by 1968 though he was assassinated later that year, legal racial equality had been achieved, but throughout the 70s many Americans felt that traditional values were under attack by more extreme social movements and there was a call for them to return on a conservative leadership leading to the election of Richard Nixon. Though he would eventually resigned following the Watergate scandal in 1979 the United States withdrew from Vietnam. Is North Vietnamese successfully conquered the rest of the country. This war was the first in history which the United States it clearly lost. Recall of course that wars like Korea or more distantly the war of 1812 are considered still mates and from some perspectives, victories. Those who had supported the war were disappointed with the outcome Lois would oppose that were angered by what they saw as a disingenuous nature of the government and pursuing it. The larger cold war still continued, however, throughout the 70s but though the east and west pursued more peaceful relations, economic conditions in the United States, worse than in the 70s in many companies even moved outside of the nation.

Speaker 1:          23:39          Cities like Detroit, Chicago, Cleveland, and New York in particular were hit by an economic downfall. In 1980 peaceful relations with the Soviet Union began to sour again as a Soviets invaded Afghanistan to install a communist regime. There there had already been turmoil in the Middle East on both sides and the region, whether it's great wealth of oil became important. Both the Soviet Union and the United States. President Carter announced the Soviet Union for their invasion and led many countries to boycott the 1980 Moscow Olympics in 1980 president Ronald Reagan was elected unifying may, branches of conservative thought. He believed in both limited federal government, but also was vigorously active in pursuing the Cold War. He increased military spending dramatically and attempted to give the US the capability to shoot down Soviet missiles in space. Though this endeavor failed, he would also engage in conflicts in Lebanon, Grenada, Libya, El Salvador, Guatemala, and also supported with how to Dean rebels in Afghanistan.

Speaker 1:          24:35          Though this organization would later turn into the al Qaeda, more specifically with the Soviets, how were things were beginning to look bleak? The Soviet Union was falling behind technologically and economically, and that was becoming more evident to the rest of the world. Mikhail Gorbachev, the Soviet Union's leader at the time attempted to save communism in the USSR by ending the arms race with the u s and by releasing and script on Eastern Europe. But this would fail. And on Christmas Day, 1991 the Soviet Union would fall apart in communism with it and Russia, the Cold War had ended. The United States emerged from the Cold War, as for all intents and purposes and unchallenged superpower and continue to intervene in foreign complex. Some saw this as American imperialism and the betrayal of nation's founding principles, others as an obligation to police the world as it is called, following nearly a century of horrific warfare and the potential for even worse warfare. Either way, they will continue to do so.

Speaker 1:          25:32          As George H w Bush intervened in Kuwait against Iraq, remembered as a Gulf war, which was a decisive victory. This continued intervention and world affairs along with inventions like the Internet and faster means of transportation and communication and things of that nature have led to terms like globalization popping up in politics, which can be ambiguous and have many meanings, but refers generally to a world which is becoming increasingly connected. A world in which the United States is playing a leading role as day. Throughout the 90s and into the modern day terrorism began increasing in the United States and in fact, much of the world, the great majority of these terrorists being from Islamic radical groups, the most significant incident and American history of such a terrorist attack is referred to as nine 11 and attack on the World Trade Center on September 11th, 2001 as well as the Pentagon and the failed attack on Washington d c these attacks would mark the beginning of increased conflict in the Middle East in Iraq and Afghanistan.

Speaker 1:          26:32          The occurrences of wish we had dealt with through the presidency of America's first black President Barack Obama, into our modern day with Donald J. Trump serving as our 45th we still continue to face many of the economic strains I began and the two thousands or even further, as well as a continuation of social movements to have roots in the nation's very foundation. And thus we have reached our own era. And this documentary. Needless to say, the United States of 1776 and the 2018 are almost completely different worlds in terms of government and political structure and culture and societal structure changes obviously to be expected as the events we have discussed in this documentary reshaped the nation year by year. But in deciding the future of the United States, we must study the history and the side, which changes are for the good and which were mistakes. But that is something I leave to you to decide for yourself. The United States is a new nation, but it may indeed have many years to come. And its future as a democratic nation depends upon the decisions of the various groups of peoples who inhabited most of which, what is done with land.
