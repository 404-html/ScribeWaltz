Speaker 1:          00:00          Hello and welcome to fire of learning. There are many more ethnicities and cultures in this world and there are nation states. Sometimes nations are the products of multiple groups coming together and coexisting. Other Times people don't fit together so easily in feel. The creation and protection of their own nation is imperative to the group survival. Other times different groups of the same people split over ideological or social disagreements. In this video, we're going to be doing a brief overview of 25 independence movements on a continent of Europe alone. 25 countries. That's a huge number y. Well, looking at the map of Europe, things have not always looked like this. The Nation States of Europe, as I said, often contain many different peoples. In the UK for example, there are five independence Momenta we'll be discussing in Spain. There are four main ones and six historic ones. Now, some separatist movements are only supported by a small amount of the population, but some have such popular support that they may soon be coming to a map near you.

Speaker 1:          01:07          Please keep in mind though, I will share the opinions of people regarding the independence of their regions. These opinions are not necessarily my own and my personal opinions will as usual be left out of the video. So first off, let's look at the United Kingdom. Number one Scotland. Scotland is perhaps the most notable on us, less because it's the only one among them that had an indisputable legal vote on independence. Within recent times. On September 18th, 2014 Scotland voted on the question of its independence from the United Kingdom with the voter turnout of 84.5% of the population. 55.3% voted no and 44.7% voted yes despite the poor results for those in support of independence, the question still may not be settled because for many Scotts, the issues have not been resolved. The division between England and Scotland goes back for centuries. England and Scotland fought for many years over the Middle Ages until 1603 when they shared the same monarch and in 1707 legally became a United Kingdom.

Speaker 1:          02:12          Scotland's autonomy has increased over the past century, but still many Scots are in favor of independence for cultural reasons such as the protection of their language and identity, but economic, political and social reasons as well, such as managing Scotland's natural resources, having an independent Scottish voice on the global political stage and making other decisions which Scotland may support, but England does not. Number two whales, another Celtic nation who's disputes with England, go back to the foundations of the two nations. They'll relations between England and Wales gradually became much smoother than those between England and Scotland. Talk of independence came back in the 19th and 20th centuries. The Welsh independence movement is for the more, not as vocal as Collins when Scotland McGann calling for independence. Many Welsh felt that a debate must be held concerning Welsh independence as well, but they are certainly not at the same point.

Speaker 1:          03:10          Surveys across the country very claiming anywhere from three to 20% of the population is in favor of Welsh. Independence support is strongest in northern Wales where over half the population may be in favor of it. Number three Northern Ireland, most northern Irish favor remaining within the United Kingdom, others with joining the rest of Ireland. However, some perhaps up to 15% of the population are in favor of the creation of an independent Northern Ireland or Republic of Ulster. The reason for this is that many Northern Irish to not feel truly Irish nor truly British Northern Ireland's origins lie in the 17th century when the area was colonized by Protestant English and Scottish settlers to reduce resistance to English rural. Today, Irish Protestants are still slightly the majority of the country. The solution to this identity crisis as well as a number of political and economic issues and disputes and their eyes could be an independent ulcer.

Speaker 1:          04:11          Number four, Cornwall, though sometimes forgotten, the Cornish identity is and has been distinct from English identity since the founding of the nation as well. Cornish and English were regarded as separate for well over a thousand years. However, in recent centuries, the decline of the Cornish language has slightly significantly contributed to the loss of identity. The Cornish, much like the Welsh are descended from the Celtic inhabitants of the island before Anglo Saxon rule. They speak a Celtic language, have Celtic heritage and in their view have a separate perspective on the world and their English counterparts. Accordingly, over half the population supports greater autonomy for the region and some support independence altogether. Some radicals such as the members of a Cornish nationalist group known as on golf may have even been connected to pro Cornish violence in recent decades. Number five, the Isle of Man, the fifth and final independence movement in the United Kingdom is that of the Isle of Man, another Celtic nation predating the Anglo Saxons.

Speaker 1:          05:16          The Manx have existed as a unique identity for millennia despite having been ruled by Vikings Scotts and of course now the UK, a separatist movement known as [inaudible] or the makes National Party has been active since the 1960s along with the goals of protecting them makes language, culture and identity. They also believe that English administration is negatively affecting the island and the party's goals are to restore the island's environment, halt immigration, build the university, and make the island more self sufficient. Now to look at France number six Brittany. Brittany is considered the six Celtic nation after the five which we have just discussed, but it is located in northwest France rather than the British isles. Brittany has a Celtic heritage language and culture is similar to that of Wales and Cornwall and in fact shares a history. Brittany as a nation existed until 1547 when it was annexed by the Kingdom of France.

Speaker 1:          06:16          Since then, it is assimilated into French culture, but within the past century of Britain, identity has resurfaced and many Britons are calling for more recognized identity, greater autonomy, or even independence from France. Around 18% of the population supports in the pennants, while 37% consider themselves Breton's first and French. Second number seven, Corsica. Corsica is a Mediterranean island which has historically switched hands between multiple nations, even for a time existing as an independent nation, but eventually it came into the hands of the French. In the 18th century there was resistance to invasion but eventually acquired many Corsicans have always felt closer to Italians and French, but ultimately and independent people along with threats to the language and culture. Corsicans have also felt that their economy has declined and that they had been subject to large amounts of immigration from peoples from the former French empire, which they don't consent to in the later 20th century.

Speaker 1:          07:16          Economic pressures led to the founding of militant groups in Corsica and in the Alaria incident in August of 1975 of course, it can rebels clash with French forces. In recent polls, around 15% of the population supports complete independence. 30% view is independence as a positive notion and over 50% would prefer more autonomy from France. Number eight, all sauce. Another example of a nation in between nations that is in ways related to both but not quite either. All sauce rest in between France and Germany and the region has been fought over for centuries, eventually becoming permanently French after world war two with their own language, identity and culture. Many Alsatians push for greater autonomy. Some for unity with Germany, but some for independence altogether for the more all sauce is one of the most religious and conservative regions in France and strain with the government often further encourages their separate identity.

Speaker 1:          08:16          Number nine Occitania Occitania covers most of southern France, but extends into Spain and Italy as well. Oxygen nationalism is rooted in the fact that accidents have a unique identity, culture and language as opposed to French dating back as early as the middle ages until the regions were subdued by conquest and interest in oxygen. Nationalism was brought up in the 1960s as the French government's economic reforms took a focus on the north of the country via autonomy and independence movements. Last speed during the 1980s button. Recent years even, there have been a number of protests and movements focusing on an oxygen and identity and voice, and now for Belgium. Number 10 Wallonia. Ever since Belgium's independence in the early 19th century, the people of will loon have asserted their own identity in the nation. This identity which emphasizes French culture and language has led to some alone Ian's to refer a policy of Ritaj Shazam to rejoin with France.

Speaker 1:          09:17          Others, however, see what Clonea as an independent nation. Historically, the Bologna and movement was closely linked with socialists activity in Belgium seeing the nation of Belgium as a capitalist creation in recent times harbor, the dispute has focused more on culture and identity and a solution to the complicated politics of dodgem. Number 11 Flenders with the independence of balloon. There is also a more culturally and linguistically Dutch group known as the Flemish in the north of Belgium. Belgium was historically led by francophones and French language and culture were favored in the nation. In fact, Dutch speakers who were skeptical of independence from the Netherlands and Flanders sometimes have their houses rated the solution for some today and we'll loon and Flinders remains the disillusion of Belgium between the groups were more French and were Dutch. However, around three quarters of Flanders is opposed to this solution and now for the many independence movements of Spain.

Speaker 1:          10:13          Number 12 Catalonia. Spain was historically the combination of multiple different peoples and many of these people's never quite lost their identity. Catalonia is perhaps the best example of this as it is one of the most active independence movements in Europe and in fact the world. In 2017 though there was a low voter turnout of only 43% of the population. 91% of them voted for Catalan independence. Separatist groups have argued that police oppression of voters led to a low voter turnout and perhaps as much as 55% of the region we have voted. However, anti independence groups believe the voting process was flawed and that issues such as the same people voting twice were present. Polls show a mix of results and though 91% of voters voted for Catalan independence, it's likely that most of the population is against it. However, it is very close, bordering around 50% subsequently, Catalonia is parliament held a vote for independence approving the measure on October 27th, 2017 however, the Spanish government deemed it illegal and try to prevent anything from happening from the start and the international community does not recognize it.

Speaker 1:          11:26          There are many reasons for us, such a strong push for Catalan independence. There are of course, cultural linguistic and social forces at work. Catalans have their own language and identity and history which they feel has been suppressed by the Spanish government. There are as well major economic forces. Catalonia constitutes only about one 20th of Spain land but holds one fifth of its economic input. Furthermore, 20% of Spain's tax revenue comes from Catalonia leading to a situation where Catalonia supports the poor regions of Spain and sees less of its tax revenue returning to its own region. Obviously Spain is not eager to let its most profitable region go and most of Europe sides with a Spanish on the issue. For the moment the decision remains in question as Catalonians themselves are about equally divided on what is truly best for the country. And people. Number 13 the Basque republic.

Speaker 1:          12:25          There is a similar situation for the people of the Basque country, which is in northern Spain but also extends into France. The Basque people have their own culture identity language. In fact, their language is one of the most unique in the world. It's origins are rather mysterious really, but it is also another economically prosperous region and Spain and thus the region economically supports the poor regions of the nation as well. As a result, there is a large amount of non Basque immigration into the region which they view is threatening. The Basques and the Spanish government have been in conflict for much of the past hundred years that a dictatorship of Francisco Franco was especially hard on them as it was for other groups in Spain as well. This led to the bass conflict in 1959 with which lasted all the way up to 2011 hundreds were killed, thousands were wounded.

Speaker 1:          13:14          The Spanish regard, the primary group responsible, the Eta as terrorist and a bass regard of the Spanish government as oppressors. And thus today, perhaps around 50% of the Basque population is in favor of independence with a Basque National Party being supported by around 40% of the population. Number 14 the Canary Islands being conquered by the Spanish and 1402 the islands have always had a sense of difference. And Bob, you guessed it, a unique culture, history and identity. The Movement for Canarian independence became much more supported in a 20th century and today, 43.5% of the population feels more Canarian in Spanish. While 49.9% of the population feels equally Canarian and Spanish, only about 5% of the population said they felt more Spanish than Canarian. Accordingly, political chaos in the future for Spain would likely lead to a strong Movement for independence. Number 15 Galicia north of Portugal in Northwestern Spain. On June 27th, 1931 the Republic of Galicia declared itself independent from Spain and maintain this independence and sell June 28th where after 27 hours rejoined the nation.

Speaker 1:          14:32          Glistens have their own language and the unique history dating back all the way to the early Middle Ages as the Kingdom of glycemia. Today, there is a push for greater autonomy and even independence in the region. Exact figures are unknown, but Galician nationalists candidates received the round 16% of the vote in a 2009 elections in the region beyond these main ones and Luzia Castiel Aragon, Conta Bria Leone, Valencia and Mercia have movements for both greater autonomy and in the eyes of some independence. Many of these movements have origins in their histories in the middle ages, but became particularly inflamed during the fascist rural of Francisco Franco and socialists upheaval in Spain. Accordingly, to this day, many pushing for outright independence of these regions are associated with socialist movements. Number 16 so Louisiana or region, which has been historically fought over Sally's yet today is divided between the Czech Republic, Poland, and Germany. However many Salesian see themselves as an independent group and some as none of the three at all.

Speaker 1:          15:39          Exact numbers are not known, but the movement is not really popular and local elections for candidates who support even greater autonomy, typically only amount to about three to 10% of the popular vote. The region is also tied with a less popular Moravian independence movement also in the Czech Republic, which would leave Bohemia as the remaining check land leading to a complete breakup of the nation. Number 17 foreign home, a small island in the Baltic Sea belonging to Denmark that people have borne home with a unique history, culture, and language similar to Danish began to consider independence from Denmark in the 20th century following economic and demographic issues. Foreign home self government party says it takes inspiration from Scotland and points to Malta in Singapore as models for his own independent existence. Number 18 the Faroe Islands. The Faroe Islands originally settled by Vikings in the Middle Ages are still owned by Denmark as they have been for most of the past millennia with their own language, identity, culture and such.

Speaker 1:          16:44          They do not feel Danish. However, but rather see themselves as a unique Norse group and push to be a separatist nation. The islands did declare themselves independent following World War II, but Denmark declared it illegal. Nevertheless, the island's inhabitants still believe in the cause of independence and feud with Denmark over the issue. However, economic concerns have worry the island's inhabitants about what's self may do to them. Number 19 the Olin islands, the island islands off the coast of Finland, Ra, primarily Swedish speaking group, the political party. The future of Olin has sought independence from Finland since 2003 with around 8% of the population supporting the measure. Very few support reunification was Sweden because of historical disagreements leading some to prefer independence. Number 20 Bavaria before Germany was a United nation, it consisted of many different German kingdoms. Among these was Bavaria, Bavaria. Traditionally a Catholic nation had much more in common with Austria than it did with the Protestant who were unifying Germany.

Speaker 1:          17:51          Attempts were made to become independent, especially during and after World War One and two, but these were largely unsuccessful. Support for independence declined over the decades, but with volatile European politics in independent Bavaria may be a favorable option for the inhabitants in the future and now for Italy, Italy, like Germany is a more recent creation for most of the past thousand years in nation we call Italy was made up of several different nations, kingdoms and city states. Some of them have accepted in Italian identity, but others hold on to their unique identities of the past. Number 21 the Republic of Venice Veneto with a capitol city of Venice along with Scotland, Catalonia and Abass is one of the more major independence movements of Europe. Venice as a nation existed for around the thousand years before the unification with Italy and accordingly they have their own culture, identity, language and history. Perhaps up to 55% of the population supports independence and over 60% supports at least greater autonomy.

Speaker 1:          18:58          After a number of protests and unofficial referendums, there were demands that an official referendum be held and that the EU support it. In October of 2017 Venetians held a referendum on the question of whether or not Venice, it should have more autonomy and with half the country voting a little over 90% voted yes. There have even been attempts or suggestions of violence such as in 2015 when a group of nations were caught trying to turn a tractor into a tank, along with the socio cultural divides and Benito economic issues are also a key factor. Venice generates a large amount of income from trade and tourism such things, but that money is used to fund the poorer parts of Italy and not Venice. A similar situation as was discussed in Catalonia and the Basque region. Number 20 to Sardinia with Corsica to the north having its own independence moment.

Speaker 1:          19:53          Sardinia in the south also has one of its own, perhaps an even more popular one because of Sardinia is unique history, culture, and many languages as well as the concern of protecting island environment. 45% of Sardinians reportedly favor independence from Italy and 40% prefer more island autonomy. According to polls around the quarter of the island already claims the have no loyalty to Italy and an additional 37% claims to be more Sardinian than Italian. While this may seem like Sardinia should be among the other more active independence movements, the independence groups are fragmented and divided among the islands, various groups and interests. Number 23 Cecily, Cecily having been conquered and ruled by a variety of nations over the centuries and existing for a time as an independent nation may want to return to that status while not receiving a large amount of support in the election. Some polls indicate that 44% of Sicilians find the concept of more autonomy or even independence favorable.

Speaker 1:          20:59          Though information is limited, the movements are also fragmented as independence is favored by balls, right wing and left wing groups. If theoretically these Italian independence movements were successful, it could cause further fragmentation and trigger a fragmentation of Italy altogether, particularly in regions seeking greater autonomy even if not much independence as of today, such as Lombardi. Liguria and Friuli. Alternatively, however, these regions may not break off individually but may come together to form the nation of academia. The day would be an Italian nation consisting of the northern provinces such as Lombardi, Benito and Piedmont. Northern Italy is economically more prosperous in the south and northern Italians feel as though the southern regions drag the nation behind. According to polls, 58% of Italians with support such a thing and in some regions results are much higher up to 80% the number 24 Transnistria Transnistria is unique and that it is one of a few on this list actually currently functioning as an independent nation.

Speaker 1:          22:06          Following the collapse of the USSR, Transnistria engaged in conflict with Moldova, a cease fire was declared a few months later, but the situation remains unresolved with Moldova is still claiming the land in 2006 97% of the voting population of the small area of voted for independence, but few countries actually recognize it. In fact, the only ones which do are other countries with disputed independence. Number 25 northern Cyprus. The divide on this tiny island came in 1983 after a coup d'etat and tending to join the country with Greece in 1974 failed. This prompted Turkey to invade the island and to this day, northern Cyprus is heavily dependent on Turkey support economically, militarily and politically. The North is heavily ethnically Turkish, culturally Turkish and speaks Turkish as opposed to the south which is ethnically, culturally and linguistically. More Greek. Turkey is the only nation to recognize its independence. However, the area does essentially function independently.

Speaker 1:          23:13          Now then to summarize, there are many movements for greater autonomy in Europe and obviously these are some which have evolved into moments for independence. The 25 we've discussed are the most notable among them. Over 10% of the population favors independence and these regions marked with purple over 40% favors it in the orange regions and the pink regions. Independence has been declared in some forums and in the red regions. The area essentially functions independently and the regions containing a star violence has occurred at some point in the past over the issue. As you can see, the UK, Spain, and Italy are not only facing independence movements, but in fact, success of such independence movements could lead to a fracturing of the nations into many smaller ones. As European politics change over the next decade, some of these movements will, whether others may intensify, some maybe come fully independent nations. Ultimately, the decision of whether or not to become independent and whether or not that choice is the right or the wrong one. Rest in the population of these regions.
