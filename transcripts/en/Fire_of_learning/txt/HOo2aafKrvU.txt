Speaker 1:          00:00          Hello and welcome to fire of learning the Myers Briggs type indicator as an increasingly popular subject as a personality test, which assigns you four letters, which determine certain preferences for decision making and highly your perspectives on things and things like that. I've made several videos on the subject already, but we can't really talk about NBTI without discussing the scientific validity of it. Some people claim as a fairly useful reference for personalities. Others are concerned that it's pseudoscience, perhaps just astrology with a psychological theme or perhaps even that maybe it's not pseudoscience, but the results aren't all that useful. So what's going on here? Well, let's start it by saying that many aspects of psychology to begin with are a bit of a jungle to navigate there, especially personality psychology, which is why at times it's harder to determine the objective and the scientific validity of a psychological claim.

Speaker 1:          00:48          And it would be to address the comparable scientific question of physics or biology or something like that. As research is a time subject to more variables in errors in psychology. Regardless, under no circumstances should we abandon the scientific method and thought process and we shall not do. So here there's a million personality tests and each of them must be weighed by its predictability, consistency, and applicability. And as far as the NBTI goes, the evidence when it is examined beyond a superficial understanding seems to suggest validity and accuracy. So we're going through explain why and then we're going to address counter arguments. So the Myers Briggs type indicator assigns you after taking a test for letters based off of four little dichotomy leading to 16 different types. The letters indicate whether you are an I or an e and introvert or an extrovert, an s or an end, a sensor or an intuitor, a t or an f as thinker or a feeler and a j or a p, a judger or a perceiver.

Speaker 1:          01:40          If you're not fully aware of what these terms mean, don't worry. We'll address each dichotomy here and each type, as I said, supposedly gives it an analysis of your personality, but highlighting her decision making preferences and perspectives. Let's get into the letters I versus e, introversion versus extroversion. That's kind of already a commonly understood concept and one which I have personally never really encountered serious criticism of on its own and so beyond saying that obviously it like every other little review here is more of a preference on a spectrum and a different difference. I he most people are not good Gary as entertainers or hermetic introverts most lie in between extremes. I won't really spend much time addressing this concept accordingly as versus an sensing versus intuition. What's this will according to what is said, intuitive types and types handle abstract concepts and ideas pretty well.

Speaker 1:          02:27          Generally they look for expanding meeting and things that contemplate the big picture very well, et cetera. Whereas ss I'm more pragmatic down to earth. They referred immediate facts and details and enjoy accompanying systems. They're not really all that interested in abstract things. Now tests clarify. Obviously everyone spends time doing practical pragmatic thinking and everyone spends time with abstract concepts. It's more of a spectrum. As I said. However, the difference is not inconsequential and there was a reason the three fourths of people are s's and one fourth test and in the United States, while sensor types are necessarily stupid, I know a few acids with in fact, high Iq is the traits of intuitive types seem to correlate to higher abilities to contemplate abstract concepts which is closely linked to above average Iq. Thankfully, this isn't just my speculation. There's been tests on this exact question. Here's some charts showing the results of those tests and of course lengths of the research and a description.

Speaker 1:          03:20          What we see here is interesting. Firstly see the correlation between introversion and Iq, which is also an already established and scientifically backed correlation, but I won't expand on that in this video. What is important though is that intuitive types line up perfectly with the higher Iq scores as opposed to ss with a little bit of currently negligible differences between t's and F's and peas and Jay's with the INTP according to this research coming out on top. Now this doesn't mean that all ends have gifted Iq or that all acids, as I said, do not. And we could of course spend all day pondering the meaning of different values for different kinds of intelligence and intelligence is and all that. But when it comes to Iq and subsequently the closely linked concept of abstract intelligence, the gifted have greater likelihoods of testing and then s reinforcing what is in my opinion and obvious correlation.

Speaker 1:          04:06          Furthermore, I think this dispels a ridiculous notion that Acu has no meaningful effect on someone's personality. And to expand on that, if we look at the personality traits of a High Iq person such as, for example, a quick comprehension of abstract topics, creativity, curiosity, fear of failure, rejection of authority in favor of independent conclusions. We see basically the same traits which the NBTI describes as intuitive types. Let's move on to thinking versus feeling t versus uh, according to the NBTI information, simply put, t's prefer to make decisions based off of objective criteria and the quarterly favor decisions and solutions to problems which are in accordance with facts and data. Efs prefer to make decisions based on a set of values and favor decisions and solutions which are in accordance with those values. And what the greater human factor in mind for whatever reason. Some people to spell this as being completely unfactual and not based on anything but really when you examine the evidence to find that thinking is preferred by about 56% of males, but more importantly feeling is preferred by 75% of females and then we compare what is found through to psychology studies and demonstrate that men have a tendency to make decisions based on objective criteria and offer solutions to problems.

Speaker 1:          05:15          Whereas women are more empathetic and more often offer support for problems. It's fairly obvious that was a TF dichotomy is highlighting are these scientifically backed differences? I've seen plenty of criticism towards NBTI stating that emotions and empathy for other people are independent of processes involved with logical thought, but that's not what Nbti highlights. It highlights more of a decision making process, not how well people understand logic or how empathetic people aren't necessarily now for the difference in perception versus judging according to the Myers Briggs descriptions. Perceivers ps essentially prefer flexibility. They prefer to improvise their plans and be adaptable. There are a little bit more spontaneous and they prefer to work in bursts of enthusiasm rather than in an organized plan. Judgers Jay's prefer to have a structure to this schedule one daily life and pursuits and such as ever perhaps a bit more organized. They prefer to stick to plans and things like that.

Speaker 1:          06:08          To put it more in terms of what Carl Young stated when he identified a cognitive functions, perceivers prefer to judge things internally and perceive externally. Whereas judges per sort of prefer to perceive things internally and an exercise or judgments on the external world. There are a number of ways to address this beyond just citing studies that prove the obvious. It's some people prefer flexibility and others the organization, one such study is average income according to type. Now what you would expect from a judger that has a say to someone who has a preference for extroverted thinking or feeling one with first to act on their environment a bit more will display a dry to achieve higher economic or otherwise success and what easily end up in positions of leadership which tend to pay higher and such. Statistics show exactly this. The ENT J by far has the highest average income, probably a mixture of extroverted thinking and intuition followed by the EST j the Eso j and then the Nfj Ist Jay and I and t j sort of have about the same level of average income according to this chart and only after that that we start to see perceiving types of GSTP and enf p.

Speaker 1:          07:12          Some surveys differ a little bit, but consistently extroverted thinkers and feelers, Aka judging types. Jay's except of course for ISF J's and nine of Jay's who are a bit different, tend to have higher average incomes than other proceeding types. Reinforcing the notion that this is not arbitrary, so that's basically the argument concerning the scientific backing of NBTI. Evidence seems to suggest that these personality differences and descriptions have a correlation to scientifically back to research if it's not a survey or study of the types of cells. Descriptions can often be supported by other scientific studies which show a connection and it's correlation can be shown to not just be happenstance. The type predicts behavior and numerous studies have shown an accuracy in prediction. With all this in mind, it's time to address some criticisms. Having dedicated actual time to research, to objectively and scientific question and analyze the personality types.

Speaker 1:          08:00          I am a Middle East, somewhat frustrated by people who've denounced it without properly analyzing it because it comes such conclusions about things without contemplation and research is overall harmful, especially when your opinion is taken into serious consideration by the public. Some have made videos or written articles announcing NBTI for misguided or incorrect reasons along the lines of we'll man, you can't define people with do four letters, dude role unique, but I suppose taking such a starkly abrasive stance with a little more than superficial understanding and bad reasoning is why you could come to expect from many modern media sites these days. And I accordingly take pride in ensuring that extra steps are taken to make sure that fire of learning is not on that boat and is as intellectually honest as possible to the point at which if the entirety of my stance here were to be proven wrong, I would delete this video and all Myers Briggs videos to replace them with a video explaining why I was wrong.

Speaker 1:          08:51          But anyway, back to the point Allison Fox and the post writes an article about the superficial reality of Myers Briggs types placing at the beginning of her article, this is where we call bs personality tests me, nothing, nothing. This is to begin with a red flag because it's fairly obviously false claim to make. Well, it may be in fact true that scientifically human behavior can be as reliably predicted as physical behavior of asteroids to suggest that it's so unpredictable and random that I can be organized in the general types of general descriptions, general descriptions, mind you not 100% accurate and predictable categories is an unjustifiable claim. We are each of us perhaps different on the individual level and even on that individual level decisions we make and our behaviors can very unpredictably, but it's totally misguided to believe that similarity and personalities and not exist at those personality similarities can not be identified and labeled into specific types and that a personality quiz can not identify these similar traits.

Speaker 1:          09:50          This is why psychologists use tests. They have a bit more preference for the big five personality tests and NBTI, which we'll explain in a moment, but I'm sorry if it hurts your feelings, but everyone can be identified and grouped according to share personality traits and they are quite frankly consequential. The author here's fairly vague and doesn't specify what she means by personality test because quite frankly, something like an anxiety or depression test can be equated to a personality test and no one would claim that these are inconsequential. In the same way that the author who believes Mpti is because such aspects of the human mind play a major role in how people function and it is obviously accepted as such, traits lead to similar behaviors in people which can be identified. Adam Grant also from the Huffington post shares her opinion. He begins by stating that originally when taking a test, he typed IMTJ a few months later he came back and type II SFP.

Speaker 1:          10:39          If you see my videos, you know that these are inverted forums of each other. The I and T J is n. I. T. E. F. I. N. S. E. The ESF is s. E. F. I. T. E. N. N. I. He evidently claims at the types are so superficial, but even the distinction between complete opposite types is arbitrary and unfounded, which is entirely misguided and observing an average IMTJ and ESF p. The difference is immediately evidence. I've never met any ESF Jay's who were actually more like me than what their type descriptions mentioned, but of course my personal experience is not what is used in scientific analysis necessarily. Ergo, I would have to ask this author to explain the consistent statistical link between Income Iq, profession, gender, etc, and Nbti if these types are so superficial. He mentioned 16 personalities.com that's a fairly common sight to take the NBTI. That's where I first took it. Might type by the way, has never changed.

Speaker 1:          11:31          I've taken multiple different tests and each of them I've scored INTP except for on one, which I was typed IMTJ no. All my personality results on this particular test could be brushed off as obviously I took just one bad test for others. The author makes a shocking statement would, which is often brought up an NBTI discussion that a considerable amount of people, perhaps even three quarters of people come back to take the test and test as a different type. I have no doubts that people do miss type. I myself have seen people get the wrong type and fine traits within that wrong type, which are applicable to them, but usually the mistype is not extremely far off and the fact that at times people do miss type does not invalidated types themselves. Ms [inaudible] occurs in all similar personality quizzes, not necessarily because the test lack any depth, but because often people change their answers in accordance with what they'd like to be treated rather than what is true.

Speaker 1:          12:21          Take. For example, my ms types quiz result. Perhaps on that quiz I'm misunderstood some questions. Perhaps a test wasn't specific enough. I could have even overestimated or change. My answer is there's something of that nature. Imagine if that had been my initial assault upon learning about NBTI and I subsequently believe that I wasn't Imtj and read description. The description may have indeed been applicable to me in many aspects. I may have read it and found that relatively fitting even though there were some things which weren't necessarily true. Now this is also where a considerable amount of criticism towards the NBTI comes in. People seem to think like astrology. Each type simply offering the list of traits which are ambiguous and good. Their board therefore be applied to everyone and so people are tricked into finding it meaningful. By that logic, though I could have even typed ESF and founded applicable.

Speaker 1:          13:06          Anyone familiar with a Myers Briggs types, however knows this is not remotely true and often many people retake the test and get a different result because they're original result isn't applicable. If I had been identified as an I and Tj, it wouldn't have been long until I or my friends who introduced the subjects. I mean noticed it was an error based on the behavior, especially when I was introduced to the of functions. It's blatantly clear that the types referred to very specific personality traits in such arguments, I believe do not invalidate the types themselves. It probably hint more towards a notion now the common tests allow room for error and bias, which should be closed and more questions should be specified to produce more accurate results. Although admittedly it is true that many online tests are more interested in reminded and helping people accurately identified a type accordingly, I would venture to guess that these myths types are generally off by one or two litters and happen because it tests is taken without much introspection or seriousness.

Speaker 1:          13:59          Maybe an NFP is actually an eye NFP. Maybe an EST j is actually an ESF Jay, maybe an INTP is actually an eye FGA. I have never once, and this is just my personal experience to take with a grain of salt, but in the year that I've been studying this stuff, I have never once encountered an individual who mistyped as the complete opposite type and I have no idea how our author here managed to go from Imtj to ESF Pete. That would require basically answering completely opposites on each question and I accordingly have to wonder what test was this exactly how much thought was put into the answering of each question. Do people really so easily go from being introverted, preferring abstract topics, making decisions based on objective criteria and preferring structure and organization to daily life, to jumping to extroversion, preferring practical cons that I was making decisions empathetically and with values and preferring flexibility and openness so easily that NBTI is useless or maybe were some answers intentionally altered an aura to write this article.

Speaker 1:          14:55          Who can say for sure, but quite frankly the bottom line is that if these results were so arbitrary of people could not identify meaningful correlations or statistics which have been proven to exist. Iq results, income averages, result averages compared with the janitor would not line up consistently and we would likely have each type evenly distributed into sixteenths among the population. None of this is the case in each of these authors have little ground on which to make their assertions. He then goes on to write the rest of the article backing it up with other misconceptions which I believe I have addressed here such as implying that thinking and feeling are independent of each other, which sure that is true, but how about in decision making process thinkers can like people, feelers can be logical. It's about how people make decisions in the interest of time.

Speaker 1:          15:41          If something does stick out, which I haven't covered, alert me in the comments section, I'll address it there. Further criticism run along the same lines. Looking at this video from vox, which isn't itself a red flags. Anyone looking for an objective and valid analysis of the topic because vox has a fairly decent record of making inaccurate in shallow videos. They percent largely the same incorrect arguments they claim. Of course everyone is too special and unique to share any identifiable traits and they quote Carl youngest saying every individual is an exception to the rule as if this was opposed to cover literally every aspect of the human experience and infer only 16 such experience that exists. They claim it's all a big scam to make money off gullible people will. I'm not making a penny off this just for the record and the most common tests are in themselves free.

Speaker 1:          16:24          They mentioned that employers use a test to assign people into jobs and imply that this is an awful idea. Then according to their animation and for that the Ist Jay is a mentor. The INTP as a manager and the ESF Jay is an analyst. You may take that as you will and other points they make is that the test results only give you positive descriptions. That really isn't entirely false. The websites themselves do sort of butter people up to encourage them to get into it more. But I have an a four videos I've made addressing the 16 types criticized each and every type. There are traits I dislike about every type, including my own. Just because of marketers don't highlight negative aspects. It doesn't mean they don't exist. They even throw in those viral images of the suppose the types of fictional characters. If the characters are developed enough, fictional characters can be typed, although it's kind of awkward to do.

Speaker 1:          17:12          And I would like to concede that the online community more interested in applying NBTI as a fad, more like astrology than to use it as an actual tool for understanding personalities do tend to degrade the image of the subject. Pause where you need to. But take for example, this should be more like this. This should be more like this and this. It should be more like this. This should be more like this, and this just doesn't make any sense. So to summarize a bit here, the validity of the Myers Briggs types lies beyond confirmation bias. As we can see a correlation, scientific data, what the letters represent, line up a psychological data which is either conducted specifically with Nbti mine or parallels with sciences, otherwise shown criticisms of Myers Briggs types tend to not criticize these points. They generally just look at superficial understanding and accordingly make misguided arguments.

Speaker 1:          18:04          So I feel comfortable in this analysis and critique. However, I have not addressed one final major quaint. The fact of the matter is most psychologists aren't big fans of it. Well why? I mean it's been shown the have scientific backing, yes. But psychologists have admittedly invented better systems to categorize personality is a big one now that that like is the big five and I could spend another 10 minutes showing how NBTI correlates to the big five and various ways, but I think that the big five in general and other parts of psychology are a topic for another video. Really though Myers Briggs types, while they can be very useful and revealing and build bridges of understanding between people are affective mostly. As a general reference telling you that I am an INTP will give you insight into my personality, but it's certainly does not tell you everything.

Speaker 1:          18:50          Knowing that someone is an I in of j or an ESP doesn't really provide insight into their home life, their mental health or overall health or their life experiences, their values, tradition or culture, et Cetera, et cetera. And from a perspective of a psychologist, it's easy to see why it doesn't tell them enough, particularly if they're conducting research or assisting a client in a form of therapy or something, they will likely have to rely on other systems or look at people on a more specific and individual level. So that's about all I have to say about Myers Briggs types. For now, I wholeheartedly welcome criticism in the comment section and encourage respectful debate between viewers. If you're looking to learn more about NBTI have made for analysis videos in youtube videos explaining the letters and cognitive functions on my channel, which I encourage you to check out and for more videos on subjects like this and many other subjects in the future and which I've already made, be sure to check off fire learning and subscribe.
