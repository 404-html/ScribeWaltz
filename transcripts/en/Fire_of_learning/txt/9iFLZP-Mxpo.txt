Speaker 1:          00:00          Hello and welcome to fire of learning. My name is Justin and I run the channel. We are essentially an educational or edutainment channel. What's our focus? Well, quite honestly, we're open to talking about all kinds of subjects, but our main focus is on history, the sciences, sociology, languages in subjects like what we talk about in videos like these. And I'd like to think that these videos are only the beginning and as you can see, not only do we talk about a variety of topics, but also in a variety of lengths. Sometimes it's a quick rundown. Other times I spent a good while covering a subject and its entirety. What makes fire of learning unique among other channels? Well, a few things. One, I leave my beliefs out of my videos. Why? Well, I could do a whole video on why and I likely will. But the main reason is that it's not my place to tell you how to think, only to give you things to think about.

Speaker 1:          00:51          Not that I don't ever share any opinions, but my politics, social views, religion, all of that I leave out too. It's all free. And it always will be. If you wanted to support us on our Patrion, that'd be great. But if not, you'll still have access to everything. I produce three, I cover whole subjects, but I tried to make them straight forward and easy to understand without leaving the good stuff out. And if it's not easy to understand, no worries. Because for I listened to you guys, I read the comments, I get, I respond to you, I pull you on your opinions, that kind of thing. So if this sounds interesting to you, I'd invite you to come check us out and subscribed by the way, because it covers so many topics. I tried to keep it organized in my playlist section to help you navigate the channel. Also, I like to think that I've gotten better at making videos over time. So maybe start with the newer stuff. Thanks everyone.
