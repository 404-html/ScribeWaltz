00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:04.080
Hello and welcome to fire of learning.
George Washington,

2
00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:09.110
who lived from 1732 to 1799 was a founding father of the United States as

3
00:00:10.381 --> 00:00:14.160
America's first commander,
first president,
and much more.

4
00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:18.090
He would begin his career in the British army and would end up later in life

5
00:00:18.091 --> 00:00:22.800
having played a major role in the foundation of the United States.
In this video,

6
00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.220
we're going to look at 10 tips and pieces of advice from Washington,

7
00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:27.420
but he left us the route,

8
00:00:27.421 --> 00:00:31.690
his many endeavors that led to his successes within them.
So let's get to it.

9
00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.480
Number 10 it is far better to be alone than to be in bad company.

10
00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.760
Washington was a man who placed emphasis on duty and honor and preferred very

11
00:00:41.761 --> 00:00:44.730
much to surround himself with people of that nature as well.

12
00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.500
Washington felt that it would be far better to stand alone than to associate

13
00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.980
with a nefarious or crooked group.
Number nine,

14
00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:56.430
it is better to offer no excuse than a bad one.

15
00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.960
Very much like number 10 this quote reflects Washington's nature as well.

16
00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.370
Washington had his priorities straight and sought to fulfill his

17
00:01:05.371 --> 00:01:10.080
responsibilities and obligations.
Likewise is someone who not only lead,

18
00:01:10.081 --> 00:01:14.400
but in many ways created an army.
He expected the same from his subordinates,

19
00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:19.110
valued their honesty and was not interested in unwarranted excuses for their

20
00:01:19.111 --> 00:01:21.300
mistakes.
Number eight,

21
00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.830
there is nothing which can better deserve your patronage than the promotion of

22
00:01:25.831 --> 00:01:27.360
Science and literature.

23
00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:32.250
Knowledge is in every country the surest basis of public happiness.

24
00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:35.550
This quote reflects a trend among the founding fathers,

25
00:01:35.551 --> 00:01:39.060
which you may have noticed an emphasis on education.

26
00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.860
The most effective means to strengthen your nation,
empower it,
defend it,

27
00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.540
grow it,
et Cetera,
is to arm the people with knowledge and Washington.

28
00:01:48.541 --> 00:01:52.680
Hear claims that it is one of the greatest things you can do for your country.

29
00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:58.260
Number seven,
worry is the interest paid by those who borrow trouble.

30
00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:03.030
Washington was a straightforward,
orderly and practical person,

31
00:02:03.031 --> 00:02:04.560
especially for rebel,

32
00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:09.860
as was hinted at with number 10 he didn't tend to associate with the wrong crowd

33
00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.530
or wander into the wrong direction.
However,

34
00:02:13.531 --> 00:02:17.670
Washington did in fact find himself in trouble many times throughout his life,

35
00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:20.280
even if it were in his eyes,
morally acceptable.

36
00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:24.120
And so this quote may be from experience.
Number six,

37
00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:29.250
we should not look back unless it is to derive useful lessons from past errors

38
00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.820
and for the purpose of profiting by dearly Bot experience.

39
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.790
Washington believed that the past was useful,

40
00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:39.750
not just the lessons of history but of one's own life.

41
00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:44.490
Washington had military and political experience prior to the revolution from

42
00:02:44.491 --> 00:02:47.460
which she drew heavily.
For example.
However,

43
00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:52.080
one should not dwell in the past,
especially not a general or president.

44
00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:55.770
We should make decisions in the presence and plan for the future,

45
00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:59.010
not be held back by our past.
Number five,

46
00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:03.040
if the freedom of speech has taken away than dumb and silent,

47
00:03:03.041 --> 00:03:06.820
we may be led like sheep to the slaughter.
Washington,

48
00:03:06.821 --> 00:03:10.690
like many of the founding fathers believed that freedom to say whatever you

49
00:03:10.691 --> 00:03:13.510
wanted was a requisite of being a free person.

50
00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:16.780
If our speech were to be censored and if opinions,

51
00:03:16.781 --> 00:03:20.860
especially opinions that society found disagreeable were silenced,

52
00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:25.840
then there would be few to speak out against injustice and organize against it.

53
00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:31.350
Number four experience teaches us that it is much easier to prevent an enemy

54
00:03:31.781 --> 00:03:36.100
from posting themselves than it is to dislodge them after they have got

55
00:03:36.101 --> 00:03:36.934
possession.

56
00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:41.540
Perhaps this can be seen as a quote referring to the battlefield as the American

57
00:03:41.541 --> 00:03:44.920
struggle to dislodge the British from their country.
However,

58
00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:49.450
it can be taken a number of ways and essentially boils down to avoiding native

59
00:03:49.451 --> 00:03:54.100
people situations or anything of the like in your life before they become a

60
00:03:54.101 --> 00:03:58.210
regular feature because removing those things is much harder than preventing

61
00:03:58.211 --> 00:04:00.010
against them.
Number three,

62
00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:04.480
true friendship is a plant of slow growth and must undergo and withstand the

63
00:04:04.481 --> 00:04:08.260
shocks of adversity before it is entitled to the appellation.

64
00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:11.440
Washington knew many people,
worked with many people,

65
00:04:11.441 --> 00:04:16.090
saw many of the same people every day,
in fact,
but for him to consider someone,

66
00:04:16.091 --> 00:04:20.680
a friend,
they had to earn it and Washington suggests that policy for everyone,

67
00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:23.830
a true friendship has to withstand struggles,

68
00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:28.750
overcome problems and display traits like loyalty and respect before those

69
00:04:28.751 --> 00:04:29.920
things are displayed.

70
00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:34.390
The friendship is not exactly certain and Washington's eyes.
Number two,

71
00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:38.950
to be prepared for war is one of the most effective means of preserving peace.

72
00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:42.910
To live in peace is the desire of all good people.
However,

73
00:04:42.911 --> 00:04:45.790
one should not expect that life to be easily obtained.

74
00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:50.230
The world is a very unfriendly place and self interested people.

75
00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:55.260
Lurk everywhere piece must be defended not only on a national level but on a

76
00:04:55.781 --> 00:05:00.130
personal level and only people who can defend their right to live peacefully.

77
00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:04.690
We'll maintain it.
Number one,
labor to keep alive and your breasts.

78
00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:09.720
That little spark of celestial fire called conscience Washington believes

79
00:05:10.001 --> 00:05:13.780
strongly in maintaining a sense of integrity,
moral character,

80
00:05:13.781 --> 00:05:17.620
and of course as he said,
a conscience.
These traits were in his eyes,

81
00:05:17.621 --> 00:05:22.300
some of the most important that one could possess and to work to maintain them

82
00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:23.290
was likewise,

83
00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:27.130
one of the most important things you could do as you go about your life.

84
00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:31.240
These traits are a very large part of how you are defined as a person.

85
00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:34.270
These were only some of the quotes that Washington left us.

86
00:05:34.271 --> 00:05:38.110
I would encourage you to check out more of what he had to say to support the

87
00:05:38.111 --> 00:05:41.920
creation of more videos like these linked to our patrion can be found in the

88
00:05:41.921 --> 00:05:45.340
description.
Any donation would be used to improve the channel.
