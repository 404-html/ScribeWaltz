Hello and welcome to fire of learning.

2
00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:07.320
I have made a mistake in my documentary on the history of England.

3
00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:12.300
I portrayed this corpse as a victim of pagan human sacrifice in Ireland.

4
00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:14.970
However,
this was an error.

5
00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.270
This is actually the toll and man from Denmark.

6
00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.480
Thank you to all of you in the comments section who corrected me because I

7
00:00:21.481 --> 00:00:22.314
missed that.

8
00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:27.000
So in this video I thought I had honor this poor fellow and correct my mistake

9
00:00:27.001 --> 00:00:30.720
by doing my research and telling the tale of the toll on man.

10
00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:32.190
So to begin,

11
00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:36.330
while scientists don't know a whole lot about who the Toa men was,

12
00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.800
they do know a lot of strangely specific details regarding the corpse.

13
00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.800
Most of the,
because of its excellent preservation,

14
00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:49.020
the tone man was discovered in Jutland Denmark in 1950 by farmers.

15
00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:53.070
It was preserved so well in fact that the woman who discovered the corpse

16
00:00:53.071 --> 00:00:56.820
thought she had discovered the body of a recent murder victim and they alerted

17
00:00:56.821 --> 00:01:01.290
the police.
The police is well examine the corpse as if it were a murder victim.

18
00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.700
But it was such a strange case that they called in the archeologist Patriot

19
00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.320
Ville home glob to examine it.

20
00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:12.360
Glob was the first to determine that the corpse was over 2000 years old.

21
00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.170
Scientists are not entirely sure when the man died,

22
00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.590
but it was most likely between 400 and 200 BC.

23
00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.200
They are however sure of how he died.

24
00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:26.460
He was hanged most likely as a part of a ritual sacrifice because of the

25
00:01:26.461 --> 00:01:27.780
arrangement of his body.

26
00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.320
He was likely around the age of 40 at the time of his death,

27
00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.280
he was mostly naked except for a cap made of animal skins.

28
00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.840
Examination showed that he likely did not shave for around 24 hours before his

29
00:01:39.841 --> 00:01:44.841
death and his final meal was 12 to 24 hours before his death consisting of a

30
00:01:45.721 --> 00:01:50.430
kind of porridge for the more this choice of foods suggest he died in the winter

31
00:01:50.431 --> 00:01:54.720
or the early spring.
His organs were left wonderfully preserved as well.

32
00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.780
And in 1976 the Danish police made a fingerprint analysis of the corpse,

33
00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:03.510
thus making it telimans fingerprints,
one of the oldest on record,

34
00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:06.660
the corpse measured at five foot three inches.

35
00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:08.940
Though people were shorter in those days,

36
00:02:08.941 --> 00:02:12.630
it was likely that the Pete in which the corpse was preserved caused it to

37
00:02:12.631 --> 00:02:14.550
shrink the low oxygen,

38
00:02:14.551 --> 00:02:18.960
high acidity environment of the Pete along with a very cold climate of the

39
00:02:18.961 --> 00:02:22.830
Nordic countries is what allowed the corpse to be so well preserved.

40
00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:25.950
Such a corpse is known as a bog body.

41
00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:31.280
The oldest bog body discovered was the Kohlberg man dating back to around 8,000

42
00:02:31.441 --> 00:02:33.090
BC.
Also from Denmark.

43
00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:36.690
Many other bog bodies have been discovered and other parts of the world,

44
00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:40.650
and many of these bodies were also the victims of what seems to be ritual

45
00:02:40.651 --> 00:02:45.651
sacrifice including 500 such bodies from Denmark alone and many from the British

46
00:02:45.991 --> 00:02:46.680
isles.

47
00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:51.420
The condition of the tone man was so similar to those of the corpse is found in

48
00:02:51.421 --> 00:02:54.480
the British isles that it led to my mistake today.

49
00:02:54.481 --> 00:02:58.500
The tone man is displayed in his silk,
a Borg Museum in Denmark,

50
00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:01.120
though unfortunately only the head is original.

51
00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:05.950
In the 1950s there was a lack of technology needed to preserve an entire body,

52
00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:09.970
and thus only the head was able to be saved.
Unfortunately,

53
00:03:09.971 --> 00:03:12.190
the body withered away over the decades.

54
00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:15.800
For more videos like this and videos on many other subjects be should have take

Thank you for watching.
