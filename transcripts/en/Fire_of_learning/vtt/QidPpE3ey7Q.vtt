00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:03.060
Hello and welcome to fire of learning.
I'm Justin.

2
00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:08.870
History is by far the most well received and biggest subject we discuss here on

3
00:00:09.091 --> 00:00:11.530
this channel.
I've enjoyed studying instance.

4
00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:15.780
I was a kid and I am grateful to have entered into a community of people who

5
00:00:15.781 --> 00:00:19.110
share my interest here on this channel.
However,

6
00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:24.200
what I have noticed is that history is kind of seen sometimes as a second place

7
00:00:25.261 --> 00:00:25.890
subject,

8
00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.890
not just among the general public but even in places like public schools here in

9
00:00:31.051 --> 00:00:32.100
the United States.

10
00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:37.140
Not seen as necessarily unimportant but behind math and science.

11
00:00:37.141 --> 00:00:39.900
For sure,
though I disagree with the perspective,

12
00:00:39.901 --> 00:00:42.000
I do understand where it comes from.

13
00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:47.210
The primary goal of the school system is to prepare the general public for the

14
00:00:47.461 --> 00:00:51.630
workforce in modern times in order to keep up with the job market.

15
00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:56.010
It is critical to keep up with science and math,
yet nevertheless.

16
00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:01.070
I do also believe that if society wants to have a population that is wiser,

17
00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.080
stronger,
more efficient and happier,

18
00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.890
the study of history is imperative.
Note,

19
00:01:07.891 --> 00:01:10.800
this is one of the Times where I go into my personal opinions,

20
00:01:10.801 --> 00:01:15.630
but only because this subject is relevant to,
well,
everything I do here,

21
00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.980
the more I have studied history,
the more I have found it useful.

22
00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.010
It has changed how I see myself,
how I see the world,

23
00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.840
and not only how I see the past,
but how I see the future.
And this video,

24
00:01:27.841 --> 00:01:32.250
I want to share a number of ways that studying history has changed my life for

25
00:01:32.251 --> 00:01:35.850
the better,
and look at how it can reshape how you see the world as well.

26
00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:37.080
So let's get to it.

27
00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:48.090
Firstly,
studying history has made me more humble and appreciative.

28
00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.350
History is Nah,
well not always very pleasant.

29
00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:57.260
When you find yourself reading about famines,
plagues,
wars,
tyranny,

30
00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:01.350
genocides,
all that stuff,
and you stop and think that real people,

31
00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.020
your ancestors,
even when through those things,

32
00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:08.760
you can get an idea of how honestly horrible life can be sometimes and how

33
00:02:08.761 --> 00:02:12.390
fortunate we are to have the things we do today.
No,

34
00:02:12.391 --> 00:02:15.870
I'm not saying everyone on the planet lives a comfortable life today,

35
00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:19.410
nor am I saying that today's world,
it doesn't have big scary problems.

36
00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:23.760
I'm not even going to say that today's problems are necessarily less worrisome

37
00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:27.870
than the one that the past,
but take for example,
the black death.

38
00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:32.550
The black death was an outbreak of plague in Europe that occurred from around

39
00:02:32.551 --> 00:02:37.551
1346 to 1353 we've talked about it a couple times on his channel and the history

40
00:02:38.971 --> 00:02:40.140
documentaries that I do.

41
00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:45.060
This was one of the worst pandemics in human history and some estimates state

42
00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:49.230
that it killed around 50% of the population of Europe.

43
00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:54.480
Consider that.
Imagine half of everyone you know,
your family,

44
00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:57.420
friends,
neighbors,
coworkers,
classmates,

45
00:02:57.421 --> 00:03:02.421
maybe even yourself dying prematurely from disease within a period of seven or

46
00:03:02.921 --> 00:03:07.480
so years.
I mean,
that's some real life then other stuff.
It's crazy.

47
00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:09.130
It's horrible that happened,

48
00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:14.350
but I am grateful that that's the reality that thanks to modern medicine we

49
00:03:14.351 --> 00:03:17.860
hopefully may not have to face again.
It's not impossible,

50
00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:21.730
but I don't tend to lose sleep worrying over the possibility.

51
00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.620
There are of course,
plenty of other examples.
Life in the Dark Ages in general,

52
00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:30.700
the Irish potato famine,
the 30 years war,
the first and second world wars.

53
00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:32.320
Through reading history,

54
00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:37.060
I have come to realize how fortunate I am to be able to eat everyday,

55
00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:41.980
shower every day,
have a job,
have access to medical attention,
have a car,

56
00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:45.970
have access to an incredible endless amount of information because of the

57
00:03:45.971 --> 00:03:49.090
Internet.
I don't have to worry about my town getting raided.

58
00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:51.700
I don't live in a wooden hut and all honesty.

59
00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:56.440
Many of us here in the West Live better than medieval kings and it's important

60
00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:00.310
to remember that regardless of whatever pain or struggles I'm going through in

61
00:04:00.311 --> 00:04:04.960
my life,
I remain aware of these events.
At least in the back of my mind.

62
00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:09.790
I think back to my ancestors who probably worked 16 hour days,

63
00:04:09.791 --> 00:04:14.230
six or seven days a week just to live a very primitive existence with the hopes

64
00:04:14.231 --> 00:04:19.231
of raising at least half of their children to adulthood and suddenly a flat tire

65
00:04:19.241 --> 00:04:23.260
or a tension headache isn't the end of the world.
Secondly,

66
00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:28.210
studying history has helped me to understand not only the world around me but

67
00:04:28.211 --> 00:04:32.410
also in a sense myself and how I fit into the larger scheme.

68
00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:37.210
It is simply the nature of humankind to look out at the world and ask what is

69
00:04:37.211 --> 00:04:42.211
this and why is it like this and then furthermore to ask who am I and how do I

70
00:04:42.851 --> 00:04:44.170
fit into all of this?

71
00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:49.240
Religion and science are both there to answer those questions.
Religion,

72
00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:50.163
if you have one,

73
00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:53.980
we'll answer your questions about the origin meaning and governance of the

74
00:04:53.981 --> 00:04:58.090
universe.
Science takes a look into the physical nature of the universe.

75
00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:03.220
A physicist would excitedly tell you have these string of events leading to your

76
00:05:03.221 --> 00:05:07.750
existence because they understand the importance of them relative to who we are

77
00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:12.640
from the big bang to the formation of galaxies and stars to those stars,

78
00:05:12.641 --> 00:05:16.390
creating the very elements in you and not around you deep within their course

79
00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:20.440
and then spilling them back out into the cosmos and spectacular explosions to

80
00:05:20.441 --> 00:05:23.770
the formation of the sun and planets and so on and so forth.

81
00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:25.720
This story of who we are.
However,

82
00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:29.500
in my view is incomplete without a look at human history as well.

83
00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:33.400
Just as we may connect ourselves to the physical universe,

84
00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:38.620
we can also find a similar connection to human civilization and to our ancestors

85
00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:43.890
and find that connecting to it satisfies our innate urge to belong to something

86
00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:48.370
greater than ourselves.
It's not as if all the countries we live in,

87
00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:51.520
languages we speak,
cultures we practice and lies.

88
00:05:51.521 --> 00:05:55.870
We live were arbitrarily invented one random day a little bit ago.

89
00:05:55.900 --> 00:06:00.290
They're are small pieces of a much larger picture of human civilization.

90
00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:03.350
There are a couple ways of looking at this.

91
00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:06.980
This is James Albert heart.

92
00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:12.370
He was born in 1843 at the age of 17 he joined the union infantry and fought in

93
00:06:15.861 --> 00:06:17.540
the American civil war,

94
00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:22.040
reportedly fighting in the battles of Antietam Chancellorsville and the first

95
00:06:22.041 --> 00:06:25.970
battle of bull run and even met President Abraham Lincoln.

96
00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:31.660
He died as the last confirmed civil war union veterans in 1953 at the age of 109

97
00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:39.200
that is a long and eventful lifetime.

98
00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:42.050
He witnessed the American civil war first hand,

99
00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:45.800
but also the first world war,
the Second World War,

100
00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:50.510
and the beginnings of the Cold War and all the major events that occurred in

101
00:06:50.511 --> 00:06:51.380
that time period.

102
00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:56.420
He lived into a time period into which many people alive today were born or

103
00:06:56.421 --> 00:06:58.040
lived in.
Similarly,

104
00:06:58.070 --> 00:07:03.070
Samuel j Seymour born 18 [inaudible] witnessed the aftermath of the shooting of

105
00:07:03.921 --> 00:07:08.360
Abraham Lincoln firsthand as a young boy and lived long enough they could

106
00:07:08.361 --> 00:07:13.361
discuss it on television dying only a few years after Mr. Hart in 1956 both of

107
00:07:15.231 --> 00:07:19.460
these men were born early enough to have met this man,
Lemmy.

108
00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:21.200
We'll cook lamb.

109
00:07:21.201 --> 00:07:25.070
You'll cook was born September 10th,

110
00:07:25.070 --> 00:07:29.570
1759 and fought in the American war of independence according to sources he

111
00:07:29.571 --> 00:07:33.770
joined up at the age of 16 fought at the battle of brandy wine,

112
00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:38.330
was wounded multiple times in the war and was present at the surrender of Lord

113
00:07:38.331 --> 00:07:42.470
Cornwallis at Yorktown in 1781 after the war,

114
00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:47.560
he became a farmer and lived until 1866 to the age of 106 that means he was born

115
00:07:51.140 --> 00:07:54.650
during the French and Indian war,
fought in the American revolution,

116
00:07:54.830 --> 00:07:56.780
witness to the Napoleonic wars.

117
00:07:56.810 --> 00:08:00.020
The war of 1812 is countries expansion into the west,

118
00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:02.570
the rise of industrialism,
et Cetera,

119
00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:05.510
and made it into the age of photography,

120
00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:08.090
but more notably and personally,

121
00:08:08.390 --> 00:08:13.130
he was one of for revolutionary war veterans who lived long enough to see the

122
00:08:13.131 --> 00:08:17.540
country that he helped found tear itself apart in civil war.

123
00:08:17.541 --> 00:08:21.290
Almost a hundred years later.
Putting this in perspective,

124
00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:26.210
my grandfather could have met a civil war veteran who met a revolutionary war

125
00:08:26.211 --> 00:08:29.450
veteran.
We could keep going.
Cook,
for example,

126
00:08:29.460 --> 00:08:33.770
was born just 27 years after the death of William Hi Zealand,

127
00:08:34.070 --> 00:08:37.460
the last known surviving veteran of the English civil war,

128
00:08:37.490 --> 00:08:40.670
which began in 1642 but you get the picture.

129
00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:42.920
Why is that so cool?

130
00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:46.700
Because it changes how we look at history.

131
00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:48.920
It personally connects us to it.

132
00:08:49.220 --> 00:08:54.110
The civil war and the revolution weren't just pages from a dry history textbook

133
00:08:54.111 --> 00:08:54.944
to these men.

134
00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:59.730
It was real life to them and there was a clear connection between them and us.

135
00:09:00.210 --> 00:09:03.540
I've mentioned before,
there are other important ways of looking at history to,

136
00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:04.913
for example,

137
00:09:05.070 --> 00:09:09.390
looking at how much more lifelike black and white images become when they're

138
00:09:09.391 --> 00:09:10.224
colorized.

139
00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:15.500
These photographs show us images of the past as real as today and remind us that

140
00:09:16.471 --> 00:09:21.060
these events were as real as today.
Another example,
believe it or not,

141
00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:24.390
changing units of measuring the passage of time.

142
00:09:24.780 --> 00:09:27.000
The Viking Age,
for example,

143
00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:32.120
ended symbolically around a thousand years ago at the battle of Stamford Bridge

144
00:09:32.490 --> 00:09:37.490
on September 25th 10 66 but you could also call it 347,872 days ago.

145
00:09:42.570 --> 00:09:45.000
Measuring history in something like days,

146
00:09:45.001 --> 00:09:49.620
hours or even minutes connects us to history by placing our lives in the
present,

147
00:09:49.830 --> 00:09:54.300
within the constant march of time,
second by second,
minute by minute,

148
00:09:54.420 --> 00:09:58.800
and makes these events in some ways see more tangible,
more real.

149
00:09:59.100 --> 00:10:04.100
It helps us feel the lives of past generations still echoing in the present.

150
00:10:05.370 --> 00:10:10.140
We've discussed long lived people whose lives extended between periods.

151
00:10:10.140 --> 00:10:11.850
We had considered separate from each other,

152
00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:16.880
but what about non human observers meet the longer new tree in Wales?

153
00:10:18.030 --> 00:10:20.370
Hopefully that's close enough pronunciation.

154
00:10:20.371 --> 00:10:24.690
Correct me if I'm wrong in the comments.
This picture is obviously recent,

155
00:10:24.870 --> 00:10:28.620
but the tree itself is over 4,000 years old.

156
00:10:29.370 --> 00:10:33.720
If this tree had eyes,
it would have witnessed all of European history,

157
00:10:33.810 --> 00:10:37.410
at least from the perspective of whales day by day.

158
00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:42.510
It meant the early counts.
It met the Romans,
it met the later Welsh.
It met.

159
00:10:42.511 --> 00:10:46.590
The Anglo Saxons had met the vikings.
It met the Normans,
hit,

160
00:10:46.591 --> 00:10:50.250
met the English.
It's heard of every monarch in England.

161
00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:54.690
It was there when people heard of a new continent to the west and watch those

162
00:10:54.691 --> 00:10:57.780
people's descendants colonize that continent.

163
00:10:57.960 --> 00:11:02.960
It watched the British empire rise and fall and stood through two world wars and

164
00:11:03.481 --> 00:11:04.920
it's still around today.

165
00:11:06.660 --> 00:11:11.100
Why do I bring these things up?
By understanding this,

166
00:11:11.130 --> 00:11:15.480
we can better look at history as an unceasing series of events,

167
00:11:15.540 --> 00:11:20.540
of actions and reactions of stories and tales that lead directly to you and

168
00:11:21.691 --> 00:11:26.490
explain what led to you being what you are or at least what you were born into.

169
00:11:26.850 --> 00:11:31.850
It helps us to realize how much we stand on the shoulders of our ancestors.

170
00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:36.990
It has taken some work,
but I am very fortunate to have an extensive family tree,

171
00:11:37.740 --> 00:11:38.550
Oregon.

172
00:11:38.550 --> 00:11:42.840
What I mean by that is I can trace my lineage back pretty far because of all the

173
00:11:42.841 --> 00:11:43.710
research I've done,

174
00:11:43.860 --> 00:11:48.860
I can go confidently as far back as about 1575 to around western France.

175
00:11:50.580 --> 00:11:54.070
I have a strong suspicion I can go back farther and that directly to send it

176
00:11:54.071 --> 00:11:58.330
from a French crusader.
I don't know for sure.
I'm still working on it.
Anyway.

177
00:11:58.690 --> 00:12:00.460
Looking back at my family tree,

178
00:12:00.550 --> 00:12:05.550
I can see history shaping my ancestors and also my ancestors shaping history to

179
00:12:06.821 --> 00:12:10.990
understand why I was born on the continent of North America.

180
00:12:11.290 --> 00:12:13.540
I look back at Nouvelle frogs for example,

181
00:12:13.570 --> 00:12:18.570
and find my ancestors came over as some of the first freshman to settle in North

182
00:12:18.641 --> 00:12:22.420
America.
Why was I born in the United States to that?

183
00:12:22.421 --> 00:12:26.860
I can see my ancestors coming into the country during the Quebec Diaspora.

184
00:12:27.100 --> 00:12:30.580
Why does it,
my family's still speak French natively did that.

185
00:12:30.730 --> 00:12:35.170
I look at the French and Indian war.
Why was I born in Colorado?
Well,

186
00:12:35.230 --> 00:12:38.800
you get the point and genealogy.
You may seem like just a hobby,

187
00:12:38.980 --> 00:12:41.590
but think of how commonly we debate today,

188
00:12:41.591 --> 00:12:45.700
how much credit we can take for the successes of our ancestors,

189
00:12:45.820 --> 00:12:50.020
and also how responsible we are for their crimes.
The latter being,

190
00:12:50.021 --> 00:12:54.340
and especially common topic in political debates really across the world today,

191
00:12:54.640 --> 00:12:59.410
understanding history prepares us to confidently handle those questions.

192
00:12:59.560 --> 00:13:03.740
History is a huge part of modern politics.
Our ancestor.

193
00:13:03.741 --> 00:13:06.790
They're not only responsible for the world we were born into,

194
00:13:06.940 --> 00:13:09.910
but the quality and condition of that world as well.

195
00:13:09.970 --> 00:13:14.890
Many of us live better lives than our ancestors like we were talking about at

196
00:13:14.891 --> 00:13:18.040
the beginning of the video because many of them worked,

197
00:13:18.130 --> 00:13:21.640
fought and died for the betterment of posterity.

198
00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:23.140
No person,

199
00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:28.200
no matter how individualistic and self sufficient is entirely self made though

200
00:13:29.321 --> 00:13:34.321
history as we've established is a way to understand how things led up to us.

201
00:13:34.810 --> 00:13:38.560
Many of us still see themselves more as individuals.

202
00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:43.060
Whether or not you know much at all about your ancestors from a thousand years

203
00:13:43.060 --> 00:13:46.840
ago doesn't necessarily change who you are or what you'll do in your life.

204
00:13:47.170 --> 00:13:51.580
And I don't mean to imply that people who think more individualistically are in

205
00:13:51.581 --> 00:13:56.260
any way wrong for doing so.
I fully respect that point of view.
However,

206
00:13:56.440 --> 00:14:00.010
history,
regardless of how personally connected to what you are,

207
00:14:00.310 --> 00:14:04.540
is still important in other ways,
maybe more pragmatic ways as well.

208
00:14:05.500 --> 00:14:07.630
The third way history has changed my life.

209
00:14:07.960 --> 00:14:10.870
It teaches very important lessons.

210
00:14:11.290 --> 00:14:16.290
History is a very good record book of accomplishments and screw ups.

211
00:14:16.780 --> 00:14:21.670
We've all heard the phrase that those who do not understand the past are doomed

212
00:14:21.790 --> 00:14:26.040
to repeat it and you can go through history and find a number of examples of

213
00:14:26.041 --> 00:14:30.940
that.
I would be careful in trying to do that and I tend to prefer the mark twain

214
00:14:30.941 --> 00:14:35.350
quote.
History does not repeat itself,
but it does rhyme.
But anyway,

215
00:14:35.351 --> 00:14:40.351
the general idea here is that studying history allows us to better shape our

216
00:14:40.751 --> 00:14:43.390
present and plan for our future.

217
00:14:44.290 --> 00:14:47.770
We are separated from the ancient Greeks and Romans,
for example,

218
00:14:47.771 --> 00:14:50.710
by a few millennia.
But we have to ask,

219
00:14:51.230 --> 00:14:53.990
are we really so very different?
I mean,

220
00:14:53.991 --> 00:14:56.360
of course circumstances are very different,

221
00:14:56.600 --> 00:15:01.600
but we are the same species as our ancestors with the same blood flowing through

222
00:15:01.611 --> 00:15:06.611
our veins to have a record book of causes and Effects of people just like us to

223
00:15:06.891 --> 00:15:11.891
analyze and think about should be viewed as invaluable to anyone planning for

224
00:15:12.231 --> 00:15:15.110
the future.
And while I don't share them here,

225
00:15:15.111 --> 00:15:20.111
I would say that studying history has absolutely effected my political views and

226
00:15:20.421 --> 00:15:21.470
how I see the world.

227
00:15:22.040 --> 00:15:25.880
Were there factors that led to the fall of the Roman Empire that could be

228
00:15:25.881 --> 00:15:27.380
present in our society,

229
00:15:27.890 --> 00:15:32.890
could understanding how the Romans dealt with those problems or fail to help us

230
00:15:32.901 --> 00:15:33.734
overcome them?

231
00:15:33.830 --> 00:15:38.480
Are there common themes between the rise and fall of Western empires or world

232
00:15:38.481 --> 00:15:39.680
empires in general?

233
00:15:40.190 --> 00:15:45.190
Are there similar triggers for revolutions and consequences for revolutions that

234
00:15:45.291 --> 00:15:49.520
go too far too fast?
Where does democracy work?

235
00:15:49.760 --> 00:15:53.780
Where does it not work?
Where do monarchies work?
Where do they not?

236
00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:58.130
Why do different political ideologies tend to work or why did it not?

237
00:15:58.340 --> 00:16:03.050
What economic ideologies work and which ones do not and why is this the case?

238
00:16:03.380 --> 00:16:07.130
How different can things be?
How similar do they have to be?

239
00:16:07.250 --> 00:16:10.670
All of these questions can be found in studying history.

240
00:16:10.850 --> 00:16:15.500
It is a way of studying how humans work are most elaborate.

241
00:16:15.560 --> 00:16:20.560
Understanding of the present is based off our understanding of what occurred in

242
00:16:20.841 --> 00:16:21.674
the past.

243
00:16:21.710 --> 00:16:26.180
Our conceptions of what the future will be like are largely based off what we've

244
00:16:26.181 --> 00:16:28.430
already experienced now.

245
00:16:28.460 --> 00:16:33.320
No doubt the future will hold things that humanity has never before experienced

246
00:16:33.410 --> 00:16:36.770
and our world will change in ways we can't predict,

247
00:16:37.310 --> 00:16:39.470
but a knowledge of human history,

248
00:16:39.590 --> 00:16:43.040
what allow us to better prepare for the unexpected.

249
00:16:43.970 --> 00:16:48.680
It may not have all the answers to future problems we've never faced before,

250
00:16:48.920 --> 00:16:53.450
but it can undoubtedly point us in the right direction to Salem.

251
00:16:54.350 --> 00:16:58.220
You may be able to extract more than three reasons from what I've said here and

252
00:16:58.221 --> 00:17:01.730
perhaps come up with Iran and then welcome you to share what you'd add in a

253
00:17:01.731 --> 00:17:06.260
comment section below.
But to summarize what I've said here,
one,

254
00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:11.390
studying history has made me more humble and appreciative of the world in which

255
00:17:11.391 --> 00:17:14.240
I live by bringing me to understand the hardships,

256
00:17:14.270 --> 00:17:18.690
but others like me in the past happened York and by helping me to recognize all

257
00:17:18.691 --> 00:17:23.330
of that my predecessors have done to make the world what it is.
Secondly,

258
00:17:23.420 --> 00:17:26.750
it has given me a way to better understand the world around me,

259
00:17:26.840 --> 00:17:27.710
my place within it,

260
00:17:28.010 --> 00:17:33.010
and to a degree though I am not fully defined by the past and for me who I am as

261
00:17:33.561 --> 00:17:34.460
an individual.

262
00:17:34.580 --> 00:17:39.580
Studying history over time gives us a better view of the larger picture of which

263
00:17:39.681 --> 00:17:44.540
we are apart and allows us to remodel our conceptions of the world and ourselves

264
00:17:44.541 --> 00:17:49.290
accordingly,
which can lead to important changes and our lives.
Thirdly,

265
00:17:49.620 --> 00:17:54.480
it teaches very important lessons and serves as a record book of things that do

266
00:17:54.570 --> 00:17:55.650
and do not work.

267
00:17:56.100 --> 00:18:00.630
There have been many mistakes made and many success is accomplished and the

268
00:18:00.631 --> 00:18:05.580
10,000 or so years of human history that we've been more or less civilized.

269
00:18:05.760 --> 00:18:10.110
Studying those things will allow us to understand why those mistakes occurred

270
00:18:10.111 --> 00:18:15.111
and how to prevent them and why the successes occurred and how to emulate them.

271
00:18:16.680 --> 00:18:19.440
