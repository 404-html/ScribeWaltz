00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.320
Hello and welcome to fire learning.
Napoleon Bonaparte began as a course again,

2
00:00:04.321 --> 00:00:08.040
man in the French army what would rise to become emperor of France and

3
00:00:08.041 --> 00:00:11.460
subsequently one of the greatest military commanders in world history.

4
00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.630
He extended his empire into a territory of the most powerful nations of the day

5
00:00:15.631 --> 00:00:19.260
at times,
taking them all on at once and winning.
In this video,

6
00:00:19.261 --> 00:00:22.710
we're going to look at 10 pieces of advice at the emperor gave throughout his

7
00:00:22.711 --> 00:00:26.770
life that perhaps we could utilize.
These are of course the words of Napoleon.

8
00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:27.451
I myself,

9
00:00:27.451 --> 00:00:30.570
I'm not taking a side either way on them for the purposes of this video,

10
00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:31.830
so let's get to it.

11
00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.960
Number 10 never fight too much with one enemy or you will teach him your art of

12
00:00:36.961 --> 00:00:41.310
war.
Napoleon had many enemies in the political arena and on the battlefield,

13
00:00:41.311 --> 00:00:43.500
but he was not constantly at war with each one.

14
00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.900
When you fight too often with your enemies,

15
00:00:45.901 --> 00:00:49.410
they begin to understand your way of doing things which can hinder you greatly.

16
00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:51.990
Napoleon further elaborated on his thinking and his life.

17
00:00:51.991 --> 00:00:56.760
Sing is best to change your tactics to surprise your enemy.
Number nine,

18
00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.110
impossible is a word only to be found in the dictionary of fools.

19
00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:03.450
Napoleon was a self made man.

20
00:01:03.451 --> 00:01:07.350
If there ever was a one coming from a small island which was barely French,

21
00:01:07.351 --> 00:01:10.590
you rose to fight.
Revolution became a general in the French army,

22
00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:13.470
then eventually would overthrow the revolution himself.

23
00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.520
The plain spoke often about how his dedication and tactical thought brought him

24
00:01:17.521 --> 00:01:18.354
to where he was.

25
00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:21.780
He believed that nothing was impossible and ended up doing what others thought

26
00:01:21.781 --> 00:01:22.650
was impossible.

27
00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:26.250
This is perhaps the most powerful way of putting that thinking into words.

28
00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.510
Number Eight,
power is in the appearance of power.

29
00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.220
As Napoleon also said,
a throne is only a bench covered in velvet.

30
00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:36.660
If you wish to maintain power,

31
00:01:36.661 --> 00:01:40.050
you must have confidence in your ability to handle that power and display that

32
00:01:40.051 --> 00:01:43.470
confidence to others so that they trust you.
Napoleon was only a man,

33
00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.710
but he was emperor because this nation recognized them as such,

34
00:01:46.711 --> 00:01:50.400
and he proved himself capable of the task.
Number seven,

35
00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.250
victory belongs to the most persevering.

36
00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.890
Napoleon knew how to get things done,

37
00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.300
how to get to where he wanted to be and how to overcome seemingly insurmountable

38
00:02:00.301 --> 00:02:02.460
challenges.
He was brilliant to be sure,

39
00:02:02.461 --> 00:02:06.240
but that brilliance would have been wasted if he was not also a dedicated and

40
00:02:06.241 --> 00:02:08.820
passionate workaholic.
Often in fact,

41
00:02:08.821 --> 00:02:12.780
Napoleon had a desk placed next to his bed during his campaigns so that you

42
00:02:12.781 --> 00:02:16.410
could wake up in the middle of the night and work his victories and it just fall

43
00:02:16.411 --> 00:02:19.770
from the sky.
They were very hard.
One.
Number six,

44
00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:23.250
take time to deliberate,
but when the time for action has come,

45
00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:26.970
stop thinking and go in.
As with all great leaders,

46
00:02:26.971 --> 00:02:31.140
Napoleon spent time putting thoughts into the dynamic of his empire.
However,

47
00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:35.610
he was a man who knew when and how to act compared to him,

48
00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:37.170
especially during his early rain.

49
00:02:37.171 --> 00:02:41.700
His opponents often seems comparatively to stumble around and retaliation to his

50
00:02:41.701 --> 00:02:46.020
quick efficiency.
Number five,
if you want something done right,

51
00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:49.680
do it yourself.
Napoleon did not only know when to act,

52
00:02:49.681 --> 00:02:53.250
but he generally had no problem getting right up into whatever he was doing.

53
00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:55.740
This quote can be taken in a few ways.

54
00:02:55.741 --> 00:02:59.680
Each of which she portrayed throughout his life during his early years as a

55
00:02:59.681 --> 00:03:01.840
general fighting in Italy,
he earned the nickname,

56
00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:05.380
the little corporal for fighting alongside his men at the battle of our coal

57
00:03:05.381 --> 00:03:08.850
against Austria,
not so much for a size down.
Napoleon wasn't really short.

58
00:03:08.851 --> 00:03:12.370
He was actually a five seven which was about average Thursday.
Later,

59
00:03:12.371 --> 00:03:16.540
he lacked confidence as Marshall's government officials and average people and

60
00:03:16.541 --> 00:03:19.450
often took control of what they were doing to improve upon it.

61
00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:22.660
He would carry this mentality throughout his life.
Even at his last battle,

62
00:03:22.661 --> 00:03:25.990
he intended to lead his old guard into battle before he was stopped by his

63
00:03:25.991 --> 00:03:27.970
Marshall's.
And number four,

64
00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:32.260
death is nothing but to live in Glorious and defeated is to die daily.

65
00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:36.610
Napoleon believed that success and glory were so important that it was worth

66
00:03:36.611 --> 00:03:37.690
risking your life for,

67
00:03:37.691 --> 00:03:42.340
and he proved as a belief by in fact risking his life and everything he had many

68
00:03:42.341 --> 00:03:45.280
times throughout his life.
He could have died and his bowels,

69
00:03:45.281 --> 00:03:47.470
he could have been executed for his coup d'etat.

70
00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:50.470
He could have easily lost many of his wars,
but he didn't.

71
00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:55.090
He persevered and even though he was defeated in the end he won glory and

72
00:03:55.091 --> 00:03:57.940
accomplished quite a bit.
Number three,

73
00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:01.180
I am sometimes a fox in sometimes a lion.

74
00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:04.420
The whole secret of government is knowing when to be,
which.

75
00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:09.730
This was definitely true of Napoleon's modus operandi.
He was cunning,
secretive,

76
00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:13.780
even sometimes deceitful,
but also bold,
daring and efficient.

77
00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:18.100
He would at times makes sly moves against internal and external politicians of

78
00:04:18.101 --> 00:04:22.600
his day and at others would straight forwardly do grandiose thinks like crowning

79
00:04:22.601 --> 00:04:23.021
himself.

80
00:04:23.021 --> 00:04:28.021
Emperor number two for hostile newspapers are to be feared more than a thousand

81
00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:29.890
bayonets at.

82
00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:34.150
This is a somewhat verbose way of saying the pen is mightier than the sword,

83
00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:36.970
but Napoleon was not saying this as the underdog,

84
00:04:36.971 --> 00:04:41.350
but rather someone who knew how important public opinion was in maintaining his

85
00:04:41.351 --> 00:04:44.830
position.
Remember,
of course power is in the appearance of power.

86
00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:48.970
Napoleon knew all too well that newspapers very strongly influenced what people

87
00:04:48.971 --> 00:04:49.540
thought of him.

88
00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:53.770
And so he in fact went so far as to take control and limit what the press could

89
00:04:53.771 --> 00:04:56.980
say about him and his achievements.
Number one,

90
00:04:57.010 --> 00:05:00.220
I have only one counsel for you,
the master.

91
00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:04.570
It was not enough for Napoleon to get by.
He had to be the best at what he did.

92
00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:06.070
He was not only a general,

93
00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:09.880
he was one of the revolution's greatest if his enemies with bold and original

94
00:05:09.881 --> 00:05:12.370
tactics.
He was not only the leader of France,

95
00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:15.520
he was emperor and he was not satisfied with France alone,

96
00:05:15.521 --> 00:05:18.580
and he set out to procure more lands and at his empire,

97
00:05:18.581 --> 00:05:20.830
his height rural from Portugal to Poland.

98
00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:25.690
Napoleon advises not settling the the master,
whatever it takes.

99
00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:30.100
These are only 10 on the points,
pieces of advice.
He of course offers much more.

100
00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:31.660
Well,
what do you think of these quotes?

101
00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:33.610
Let me know in the comments section below.

102
00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:36.580
For more videos like this and videos on many other subjects,

103
00:05:36.581 --> 00:05:38.920

104
