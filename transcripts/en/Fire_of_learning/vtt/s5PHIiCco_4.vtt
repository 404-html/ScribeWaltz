Hello and welcome to fire of learning.

2
00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:07.610
The Anglo Zulu war was a six month conflicts pot from January to do lie in 1879

3
00:00:08.401 --> 00:00:12.240
between the British empire and the Zulu kingdom and Modern Day South Africa.

4
00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.210
The war was,
as I said,
only six months long,

5
00:00:15.211 --> 00:00:19.410
but relative to what was going on in Europe,
Africa,
and the rest of the world,

6
00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.880
it wasn't important historical event as it signaled the fate of nations and have

7
00:00:23.881 --> 00:00:25.140
an entire continent.

8
00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.680
And in this video today we're going to be talking about that.
So let's get to it.

9
00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.920
So here's a map of the region in 1878 a year before the war began.

10
00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.820
Five regions here are important to recognize,
to really grasp the situation.

11
00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.810
You have,
of course,
the Zulu kingdom here,

12
00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.880
the Zulus are a native African people.

13
00:00:44.881 --> 00:00:49.110
They were by far the most powerful African tribe in South Africa at the time.

14
00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.160
Then you have here Cape Colony,
that's the main British colony,

15
00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.530
but you also have the South African Republic,

16
00:00:55.531 --> 00:00:59.370
also known as trans of all the orange free state and the tall here.

17
00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.480
These were nations essentially set up by the Dutch for trackers,

18
00:01:03.481 --> 00:01:05.460
which basically is a Dutch for pioneers.

19
00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:09.240
The Dutch were very active in this region before the British had basically

20
00:01:09.241 --> 00:01:12.670
complete control of the region as they do here in 1878 and that descendants

21
00:01:12.671 --> 00:01:16.470
sentence of those people are responsible for setting up these nations around

22
00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.450
this area.
At this time,
the tall,

23
00:01:18.451 --> 00:01:21.660
which was a formerly state like that have been annexed by the British empire and

24
00:01:21.661 --> 00:01:25.500
Trans well was considered a British protectorate as they relied on the British

25
00:01:25.501 --> 00:01:29.100
for protection from the Zulu tribe.
To take it back to the beginning,

26
00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.390
European interest in Africa really began in the 15th and 16th centuries is

27
00:01:33.391 --> 00:01:35.640
during the age of exploration and all of that.

28
00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.190
South Africa was an important area.

29
00:01:38.191 --> 00:01:41.010
It was about halfway by sea between Europe and India,

30
00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.940
but the Portuguese who were interested in the area weren't entirely interested

31
00:01:44.941 --> 00:01:45.960
in colonizing it,

32
00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.200
at least not the regions we're talking about today as they had better

33
00:01:49.201 --> 00:01:52.920
opportunities in Mozambique,
northeast of here,
but Dutch,
however,

34
00:01:52.921 --> 00:01:56.940
did settle be area establishing a base camp for passing ships which grew into a

35
00:01:56.941 --> 00:02:00.480
colony.
As more and more European settlers arrived at the region.

36
00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.810
Of course it wasn't long until conflict arose with the natives.

37
00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.520
Most notably the quick quite tribe.

38
00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.520
The Europeans and the Africans kept their distance,

39
00:02:08.521 --> 00:02:10.800
but conflict at times did arrives.

40
00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:15.480
The British became active in the region in the 18th century and eventually Annex

41
00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.750
Cape Colony.
It was briefly returned to the Dutch there a Napoleonic wars,

42
00:02:18.751 --> 00:02:22.080
but in 1815 the region was firmly British.

43
00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:26.130
British rule over Cape Colony would lead to what is known as the great trek.

44
00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:28.110
The four Traegers I mentioned earlier,

45
00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:31.710
also known as the Boers by the British were mainly to descendants of Dutch

46
00:02:31.711 --> 00:02:34.770
colonists,
but also German,
Scandinavians and French who you know,

47
00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:38.640
they left the cape.
Connie in the 1820 is to sell new lands,

48
00:02:38.641 --> 00:02:41.180
which would eventually lead to the multiple independent Bora.

49
00:02:41.181 --> 00:02:42.750
Publix I was talking about earlier,

50
00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:46.080
three of the notable ones and could have the South African Republic,

51
00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:49.500
also known as Trans Paula said,
and the Orange Free State,
good at Claire,

52
00:02:49.501 --> 00:02:53.970
their sovereignty and the 1850s and then a republic who declared a sovereignty

53
00:02:53.971 --> 00:02:58.590
and 1830s then Natalia republic having formed after conflict with the Zulus and

54
00:02:58.591 --> 00:03:03.250
most notable engagements of this conflict was the battle of block river or on

55
00:03:03.251 --> 00:03:08.251
604 trekkers engage around $15,000 the battle was essentially a slaughter.

56
00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:13.180
3000 Zulu warriors were killed by the better equipped for a tracker.

57
00:03:13.181 --> 00:03:16.760
She took no losses and had only three wounded.
Following this battle,

58
00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:20.680
the Zulus suffered internal turmoil and the bore is began or settlement more

59
00:03:20.681 --> 00:03:22.270
confidently.
However,

60
00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:27.310
Natalia was annexed by the British in 1843 the Zulus,
we're not an ancient tribe.

61
00:03:27.311 --> 00:03:30.400
In fact,
they were very recently formed power in the region.

62
00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:34.690
Their full name Alma Zulu means to people of the heavens.

63
00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:37.900
Their rise to power can be attributed to a man named Shaka.

64
00:03:37.901 --> 00:03:42.670
Zulu born in 1787 essentially the founder of the kingdom before him,

65
00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:46.870
the zero is we're a smaller try relative to the more powerful and faith Wa and

66
00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:51.640
Dwan way tribes close to the east.
Shaka was the illegitimate son of Cinzano,

67
00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:56.410
Gakona Pajama and being legitimate was outcasted.
However,

68
00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:00.850
Shaka was determined to regain his will and supported by Dingus Swale,

69
00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:03.790
a chief of the [inaudible].
He took control of the tribe,

70
00:04:03.791 --> 00:04:04.810
killing his half brother,

71
00:04:04.811 --> 00:04:09.430
who has exceeded his father and became the ruler of the Zulu people when Dingus

72
00:04:09.431 --> 00:04:13.450
Way Oh died in battle against the in Dwan way a year later shuck it took up his

73
00:04:13.451 --> 00:04:15.490
rule as well in wage war against them,

74
00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:18.160
Shaka began to reorganize Hulu way of life.

75
00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:22.510
He created new battle tactics such as the horns of the bull and implemented more

76
00:04:22.511 --> 00:04:25.810
efficient weaponry such as a mortician spear called an equal,

77
00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:28.990
which replaced the throwing spear.
He thought to be cowardly.

78
00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:31.120
This aided his soldiers in battle.

79
00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:34.570
He forced his soldiers to walk and run without sent us a toughened them and

80
00:04:34.571 --> 00:04:38.920
killed anyone who rejected.
He reorganized the religious structure of the tribe,

81
00:04:38.921 --> 00:04:41.830
ensuring that the witch doctors were loyal to the tribe and not a more

82
00:04:41.831 --> 00:04:43.090
independent entity.

83
00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:47.950
The Zulu nation was essentially a more primitive version of Sparta where war and

84
00:04:47.951 --> 00:04:50.290
producing warriors were of the highest importance.

85
00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:53.350
Boys were trained at a young age and typically enter the main army.

86
00:04:53.351 --> 00:04:57.850
At 14 Shaka had transformed warfare prior to this.

87
00:04:57.851 --> 00:05:01.330
Warfare in this area was more ceremonial and less intense.
However,

88
00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:05.200
Shaka became much more aggressive and took on his enemies with the intent to

89
00:05:05.201 --> 00:05:08.490
slaughter and dominate.
He was not merciless to his enemies though,

90
00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:11.890
and whenever he conquered them,
he welcomed them to join his nation,

91
00:05:11.891 --> 00:05:15.970
which eventually helped him to lead over a quarter of a million people.

92
00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:19.840
Shaka achieved all this at a time when Europeans were,

93
00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:23.380
as we've been talking about becoming more and more interested in active in the

94
00:05:23.381 --> 00:05:27.520
region,
he naturally distrusted Europeans and mostly rejected their weaponry in

95
00:05:27.521 --> 00:05:30.040
technology such as riding horses and firearms,

96
00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:33.670
but he knew their influence in the region was permanent and that they would

97
00:05:33.671 --> 00:05:34.930
eventually have to deal with them.

98
00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:38.150
His reign ended when he was assassinated by two of his half brother that's

99
00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:38.610
fucking trouble.

100
00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:43.450
His throne in 1828 Zulu legend holds that Shaka uttered a warning in his final

101
00:05:43.451 --> 00:05:45.190
moments sitting at one day,

102
00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:48.220
white men from the sea would come through or the zoo people.

103
00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:51.790
It would not be long before the prophecy will be put to the test.

104
00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:55.030
As the Boers were leaving cape colony and setting up their own nations.

105
00:05:55.031 --> 00:05:58.340
Sellers from Britain were arriving and settling South Africa as well.

106
00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:03.060
In the late 1860s as small shiny pebble was discovered by Erasmus,

107
00:06:03.061 --> 00:06:04.880
Jacob's along the Orange River,

108
00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:09.020
the pebble turned out to be a diamond and South Africa became a hotspot for

109
00:06:09.021 --> 00:06:11.240
diamonds as well as gold and other resources.

110
00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:14.150
This encouraged both a diamond and a gold rush.

111
00:06:14.151 --> 00:06:17.680
The region which in turn enticed the British to expand further into the breach

112
00:06:17.681 --> 00:06:20.930
and to gain tighter control calling stress between the British,

113
00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:24.260
the bores and the native Africans conflict including,

114
00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:28.340
and that'll be conflict between the British and the Zulus was no most certainly

115
00:06:28.341 --> 00:06:29.300
on the horizon.

116
00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:32.900
If you've seen a two part documentary I did on England covering the whole

117
00:06:32.901 --> 00:06:34.370
history of the nation.
You know,

118
00:06:34.371 --> 00:06:38.120
the position of the British empire was in during the eighties seventies Britain

119
00:06:38.121 --> 00:06:42.170
had defeated their major colonial rival France during the Napoleonic wars and

120
00:06:42.171 --> 00:06:45.020
was the unchallenged world power during this time.

121
00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:49.250
They were right in the middle of Pax Britannica and the relative peace at home

122
00:06:49.251 --> 00:06:53.750
allowed Britain to focus its efforts on colonial pursuits such as South Africa.

123
00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:57.950
The British wanted to turn South Africa and to a kind of federation like they

124
00:06:57.951 --> 00:06:59.600
had done recently in Canada,

125
00:06:59.601 --> 00:07:03.140
which essentially means that the state would be loyal to the British empire and

126
00:07:03.141 --> 00:07:06.530
under its political rule,
but will be largely self sufficient and govern.

127
00:07:06.531 --> 00:07:08.120
Most of it's internal affairs.

128
00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:11.900
And the 1870s they invited the board states into this federation,

129
00:07:11.901 --> 00:07:15.170
but the Boris refused this with a sign the conflict.

130
00:07:15.171 --> 00:07:19.190
We continue between Europeans and the region despite their refusal to British

131
00:07:19.191 --> 00:07:22.490
Annex Transvaal.
Anyway,
the board,
his voice,
his agreement,

132
00:07:22.491 --> 00:07:25.520
but they knew that they depended on Great Britain for protection from the zoo,

133
00:07:25.521 --> 00:07:29.630
those and I said so there was a little they could do with Transvaal in British

134
00:07:29.631 --> 00:07:30.021
hands.

135
00:07:30.021 --> 00:07:33.320
The next step was to do something about the Zulus who threaten the border and

136
00:07:33.321 --> 00:07:34.250
had disputes over it.

137
00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:39.200
Now the High Commissioner of South Africa for air along with many other notable

138
00:07:39.201 --> 00:07:41.080
British South African figures like Theopolis,

139
00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:45.320
[inaudible] favorite conflict and thought it was necessary to securing a strong

140
00:07:45.321 --> 00:07:46.370
presence in the region,

141
00:07:46.820 --> 00:07:51.440
but both the British government at home and the Zulu kink at Schwab did not want

142
00:07:51.441 --> 00:07:52.160
war.

143
00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:56.300
The British government had other colonial matters to worry about in India and

144
00:07:56.301 --> 00:07:58.280
the Middle East and strain with other powers,

145
00:07:58.350 --> 00:08:02.420
notably Russia as well as concern over the rising power of Germany and the

146
00:08:02.421 --> 00:08:03.254
United States.

147
00:08:03.470 --> 00:08:07.250
They did not want another huge conflict on the edge of the map to deal with and

148
00:08:07.251 --> 00:08:11.150
indeed the British Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli made it perfectly clear

149
00:08:11.390 --> 00:08:12.670
regarding the Zulus.

150
00:08:12.810 --> 00:08:16.220
The zealot is we're one of the most prominent and noteworthy Subsaharan African

151
00:08:16.221 --> 00:08:20.480
tribes,
but they were still technologically Grilli inferior to the British.

152
00:08:20.810 --> 00:08:24.230
They fought primarily with spears.
Some of them had procured European weapons,

153
00:08:24.231 --> 00:08:26.810
but they were not trained with them.
They did not have the wheel.

154
00:08:26.870 --> 00:08:27.890
They did not have calorie,

155
00:08:27.891 --> 00:08:31.880
and with past experiences with white colonists kink each way on knew that the

156
00:08:31.881 --> 00:08:33.620
odds were really stacked against him,

157
00:08:33.621 --> 00:08:37.820
but he nevertheless refused to submit to foreign rural and territorial demands.

158
00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:41.870
Knowing this,
the South African government decided that they had the south,

159
00:08:41.871 --> 00:08:44.300
the war before the government back home could react.

160
00:08:44.390 --> 00:08:48.560
So they sent the Zulus and ultimatum that they knew would be rejected,

161
00:08:48.561 --> 00:08:49.820
demanding multiple things,

162
00:08:49.821 --> 00:08:53.180
including that they just spend their military except Christian missionaries and

163
00:08:53.181 --> 00:08:57.000
allow them to work on impeded and allow our British representative into their

164
00:08:57.001 --> 00:09:00.030
country to ensure that the wishes of the British government were followed.

165
00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:01.530
Essentially,

166
00:09:01.620 --> 00:09:05.610
they demanded that the Zulus capitulate without a fight and the Zulus resisted

167
00:09:05.611 --> 00:09:07.050
and prepared for war.

168
00:09:07.530 --> 00:09:11.820
A South African British without authorization from the government back home then

169
00:09:11.821 --> 00:09:15.960
invaded Zulu territory on a lieutenant general Frederick Augustus Dessinger

170
00:09:16.050 --> 00:09:21.050
barren of Chelmsford chum skirt had experienced fighting and the Crimean war and

171
00:09:21.211 --> 00:09:24.840
India and he and many other people under his command had experienced fighting in

172
00:09:24.841 --> 00:09:26.220
other African conflicts.

173
00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:30.480
He believed that the Zulus would probably retreat until they were forced to make

174
00:09:30.481 --> 00:09:35.220
a stand probably at [inaudible],
which served as a capital city.
At first,

175
00:09:35.250 --> 00:09:39.600
he appeared to be right and he marched unopposed and to Zulu land.
Early on,

176
00:09:39.601 --> 00:09:44.601
and his advanced is center column came to camp at East Santillana on January

177
00:09:45.390 --> 00:09:49.020
22nd which was a name of an isolated hill and the region while camping,

178
00:09:49.050 --> 00:09:52.750
scouse reported the Zulu force of it spotted elsewhere in Nord showmes for

179
00:09:52.751 --> 00:09:57.270
divided the forest that Nissan wanna to go and pursue them taking around 2,300

180
00:09:57.271 --> 00:10:01.050
men to consider the Zulus and leaving behind around 1,500 men,

181
00:10:01.500 --> 00:10:05.790
Chelmsford had underestimated his enemies.
However,
the Zulu forest,

182
00:10:05.791 --> 00:10:08.760
his scouts had spotted was not the main zoo would force.

183
00:10:08.761 --> 00:10:10.530
It wasn't intentional diversion.

184
00:10:10.860 --> 00:10:15.860
Later on around 11:00 AM scout's of Henry Pearlene discovered a force of 20

185
00:10:15.991 --> 00:10:20.370
thousands you know those hiding silently nearby waiting for the opportunity for

186
00:10:20.371 --> 00:10:21.204
an assault,

187
00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:24.960
knowing that they had been discovered that they immediately set out to attack

188
00:10:24.961 --> 00:10:28.640
the British not.
This was one advantage that the zoo has had over the British.

189
00:10:28.641 --> 00:10:29.474
This was speed.

190
00:10:30.060 --> 00:10:34.320
The British had moved so far at an average of one mile a day in the Zulus had

191
00:10:34.321 --> 00:10:37.760
moved at 10 miles a day.
The was,
we're so fast.
In fact,

192
00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:41.100
the British officers sometime is told their men to consider them like cavalry

193
00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:43.140
and unlike the British,
when they were discovered,

194
00:10:43.141 --> 00:10:45.270
they did not have a slow reaction.

195
00:10:45.271 --> 00:10:48.600
They quickly immediately pursued the British scouts to them to attack the

196
00:10:48.601 --> 00:10:52.260
British camp at East Atlanta.
The zoo is prepared to attack the camp,

197
00:10:52.261 --> 00:10:56.190
organizing what is called the horns of the bull formation,
which look like this.

198
00:10:56.700 --> 00:10:59.970
The intention here was to encircle the enemy forest and crush it.

199
00:11:00.030 --> 00:11:02.940
The right and left flanks or the horns were composed of the younger,

200
00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:06.780
faster warriors and the center was composed of more experienced battle hardened

201
00:11:06.781 --> 00:11:09.060
troops that came in and crushed the enemy.

202
00:11:09.270 --> 00:11:13.020
This tactic works especially well in the open field and it just so happened that

203
00:11:13.021 --> 00:11:15.440
the British had Nissan wanna in their overconfidence,

204
00:11:15.450 --> 00:11:18.060
hadn't neglected building proper fortifications.

205
00:11:18.210 --> 00:11:21.870
The Zulus dim began to run toward the camp and the British prepared a weak

206
00:11:21.871 --> 00:11:22.704
defense.

207
00:11:23.130 --> 00:11:27.070
The British were outnumbered about 15 to one here and their only hope was to try

208
00:11:27.071 --> 00:11:30.420
to stall the advance of the zoo of those with gunfire and artillery and

209
00:11:30.421 --> 00:11:34.500
hopefully rout them.
This did at first slow the Zulu advanced,
but the Zulus,

210
00:11:34.501 --> 00:11:37.260
we're still able to hit the British lines and overwhelmed them.

211
00:11:37.890 --> 00:11:39.450
At some point in the battle,

212
00:11:39.451 --> 00:11:43.170
the British soldiers probably started realizing that they were surrounded,

213
00:11:43.420 --> 00:11:47.700
outnumbered,
and that they couldn't hold the advance.
There was no escape.

214
00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:52.230
They had to fight to the death as a solar eclipse occurred over the battle May.

215
00:11:52.231 --> 00:11:56.840
Last stands are made some infantry men form squares and far with their bare nuts

216
00:11:56.970 --> 00:12:01.130
and many of the calvary men who were able to escape their horses instead the

217
00:12:01.131 --> 00:12:05.170
site at the state and help the defense heroically Zulu accounts of the battle

218
00:12:05.171 --> 00:12:09.520
tell him a very large Irishman who was determined to defend Lord Chelmsford tent

219
00:12:09.521 --> 00:12:13.750
and therefore the flag he single handedly held off the Zulus until he was

220
00:12:13.751 --> 00:12:16.030
eventually killed and the color was lost.

221
00:12:16.090 --> 00:12:21.090
The Battle of AESOP Ilana ended at about 3:00 PM with about 95% of the British

222
00:12:21.371 --> 00:12:26.371
force having been killed or about 1300 people estimate state that the Zulus lost

223
00:12:26.651 --> 00:12:30.580
around that many men as well.
Of the British survivors,
many were officers.

224
00:12:31.090 --> 00:12:34.720
The reasoning for this was that the Zulus were told to ignore civilians who

225
00:12:34.721 --> 00:12:38.950
usually dressed in black and many of them confuse a darker officer uniform for

226
00:12:38.980 --> 00:12:39.820
civilian clothing,

227
00:12:39.821 --> 00:12:43.660
which allowed them to escape the Zulus looted everything in the British camp and

228
00:12:43.661 --> 00:12:46.120
not a ticket or left.
It is strung out on the field.

229
00:12:46.570 --> 00:12:50.050
They then walked the field cutting open the chest of the Zulu in British dead

230
00:12:50.051 --> 00:12:53.500
with respect to their belief that this practice allow the spirit to leave the

231
00:12:53.501 --> 00:12:54.850
body.
But to the British,

232
00:12:54.851 --> 00:12:58.560
this created an even more gruesome scene of a battle of east song.

233
00:12:58.561 --> 00:13:02.890
Wanna is regarded as the worst military defeat suffered by advanced forest to a

234
00:13:02.891 --> 00:13:05.680
more primitive indigenous army.
In modern history,

235
00:13:06.430 --> 00:13:09.010
the British were totally slaughterd and overwhelmed.

236
00:13:09.610 --> 00:13:12.220
Lord Chelmsford was primarily to blame.

237
00:13:12.340 --> 00:13:14.770
Not only had he mistakenly split his force,

238
00:13:14.780 --> 00:13:16.780
neglected to prepare defenses that his camp,

239
00:13:17.080 --> 00:13:20.470
but he had not take requests for aid that arrived to him during the battle.

240
00:13:20.470 --> 00:13:21.340
Seriously enough,

241
00:13:21.730 --> 00:13:26.410
at 3:30 PM at Chelmsford was informed the news of the disaster during tea time

242
00:13:26.440 --> 00:13:29.350
and immediately set out to the camp,
but it was too late.

243
00:13:29.650 --> 00:13:32.790
Chelmsford had no choice but to the group outside of Zulu land,

244
00:13:33.490 --> 00:13:36.070
but this would not be the only major event to occur on this day.

245
00:13:36.790 --> 00:13:38.740
On the same day at Rorke's drift,

246
00:13:38.741 --> 00:13:43.120
which served as a British military base 3,500 zero is that it's put off from the

247
00:13:43.121 --> 00:13:46.350
main army conducted and attack left to defend.

248
00:13:46.351 --> 00:13:48.910
It was just under 200 British soldiers.

249
00:13:49.210 --> 00:13:52.840
The British would actually have an opportunity to redeem themselves here.

250
00:13:53.380 --> 00:13:57.040
The key difference from [inaudible] to here was at work strips was a four to

251
00:13:57.041 --> 00:13:59.980
five position in a British intended to hold it for.

252
00:13:59.981 --> 00:14:04.030
To find a position was key as a Zulu is primarily preferred hand to hand combat.

253
00:14:04.390 --> 00:14:07.870
This made their horns of the bull maneuver much less effective if they couldn't

254
00:14:07.871 --> 00:14:10.240
breach the defenses.
There wasn't much they could do.

255
00:14:10.420 --> 00:14:14.470
In the face of thousands of Zulu is a 200 or so British soldiers came out

256
00:14:14.471 --> 00:14:19.471
victorious after about 10 hours of fighting Song Juana and work strict are the

257
00:14:19.721 --> 00:14:21.670
two most common disgust battles of the war.

258
00:14:21.671 --> 00:14:24.730
Sometimes I noticed other sources don't even discuss the other battles,

259
00:14:25.330 --> 00:14:27.190
but in fact the same exact day.

260
00:14:27.191 --> 00:14:30.700
A third engagement occurred when Colonel Pearson's coastal column was attacked

261
00:14:30.701 --> 00:14:31.534
by zoo.

262
00:14:31.960 --> 00:14:35.980
The Zulus were repelled with great things to the Gatling gun of the British had

263
00:14:36.250 --> 00:14:39.700
and a few days later,
not knowing and full of what had happened at Aesop,
Juana,

264
00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:43.600
the troops reached and abandoned mission called s how instead of fortifications

265
00:14:43.720 --> 00:14:48.520
there on January 27th Chelmsford suggested through telegram that Pearson

266
00:14:48.530 --> 00:14:51.080
retreats still without even having mentioned Nissan's.

267
00:14:51.650 --> 00:14:54.710
When Pearson finally did learn about the battle in early February,

268
00:14:54.890 --> 00:14:58.250
he felt it necessary to hold his ground and fearing of the Zulus when attack,

269
00:14:58.251 --> 00:14:59.690
if he did try to withdrawal,

270
00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:03.290
he requested reinforcements though Chelmsford ordered him back again.

271
00:15:03.950 --> 00:15:06.350
Pearson protested saying that large there was a zoo.

272
00:15:06.351 --> 00:15:10.370
Those had been senior by and would only retreat if necessary when he received no

273
00:15:10.371 --> 00:15:11.540
response to that message.

274
00:15:11.541 --> 00:15:15.320
He knew that the area had been cut off by the Zulus and the siege of s how had

275
00:15:15.321 --> 00:15:19.380
begun.
The of the Zulus had one,
they're decisive.
Victory could sway on,

276
00:15:19.390 --> 00:15:20.930
knew that it would be short lived.

277
00:15:21.290 --> 00:15:25.220
Such a catastrophic defeat would only entice the British to press harder on the

278
00:15:25.221 --> 00:15:27.800
war record and that's exactly what London agreed to do.

279
00:15:28.100 --> 00:15:29.150
When they learn of the battle,

280
00:15:29.510 --> 00:15:33.290
they sent reinforcements which arrived in March prime minister.

281
00:15:33.291 --> 00:15:34.280
It is rarely blamed,

282
00:15:34.281 --> 00:15:38.150
Lord Chelmsford and covenants for the failure of the first suit of invasion,

283
00:15:38.151 --> 00:15:42.680
and it was in fact significantly his fault though we'd tried to pin the blame on

284
00:15:42.681 --> 00:15:45.580
other people and exaggerated the number of Zulus he was up against,

285
00:15:45.830 --> 00:15:49.550
especially at [inaudible] where he claimed his fourth is we're up against 60,000

286
00:15:49.560 --> 00:15:53.090
Zulus instead of the actual 20,000 in early March,

287
00:15:53.091 --> 00:15:57.140
the Zulus would win minor victories at the battles of in Ptomaine.
Hello Bonnie.

288
00:15:57.320 --> 00:16:01.340
As Chelmsford struggled to regroup and reorganize another invasion of Zulu land.

289
00:16:02.120 --> 00:16:04.630
Pearson's men still remained be seated as how,

290
00:16:04.631 --> 00:16:06.680
but the Zulus did not make any major attacks.

291
00:16:06.710 --> 00:16:10.490
Probably learning from work strip that attacking a four to five position did not

292
00:16:10.491 --> 00:16:14.330
always go so well.
Meanwhile,
the men,
there's suffered from poor conditions,

293
00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:17.090
lack of rations,
and died slowly from diseases there.

294
00:16:17.180 --> 00:16:19.250
Chelmsford has been focusing on plans.

295
00:16:19.251 --> 00:16:22.700
There were leaves them the day after who Urbani to British engages Zulus and

296
00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:26.990
score a decisive victory killing around a thousand the battle of calm Beulah was

297
00:16:26.991 --> 00:16:31.550
very much the turning point of the war and soon after on April 3rd troops

298
00:16:31.551 --> 00:16:35.390
arrived to relieve the men had s how and succeeded in doing so at the battle of

299
00:16:35.391 --> 00:16:39.560
gain gain.
Lobo artillery was key here.
The British had to Gatling guns,

300
00:16:39.590 --> 00:16:42.140
two cannons and four batteries of rocket artillery,

301
00:16:42.141 --> 00:16:44.480
which were crucial to repelling the Zulu advance.

302
00:16:44.730 --> 00:16:46.520
Despite this string of victories,

303
00:16:46.521 --> 00:16:50.120
the British did not have great morale at this point.
Chelmsford,
however,

304
00:16:50.121 --> 00:16:53.570
had an urgent need of a great victory.
More British reinforcements.

305
00:16:53.571 --> 00:16:55.370
About 20,000 troops were coming,

306
00:16:55.400 --> 00:16:59.240
but also his replacement Sir Garnet walls lea was coming as well.

307
00:16:59.450 --> 00:17:03.530
Chelmsford intended to score a major victory before his replacement could arrive

308
00:17:03.531 --> 00:17:07.070
and it's in an attempt to restore his reputation in June.

309
00:17:07.071 --> 00:17:09.650
He prudently advanced in Suzuki territory again,

310
00:17:09.651 --> 00:17:13.270
this time taking extra precautions against the repeat of East Song,
why?

311
00:17:13.550 --> 00:17:16.910
It was during the second invasion that Catcheway who actually offered a peace

312
00:17:16.911 --> 00:17:21.080
treaty,
but Chelmsford reputation was at stake and in June he was on his trail.

313
00:17:21.081 --> 00:17:24.140
So the offers were refused.
The British engaged the zoo,

314
00:17:24.141 --> 00:17:27.890
those in a final battle for the capital city of a loony Aandra life.
For us,

315
00:17:28.040 --> 00:17:30.770
the victory was another decisive British victory.

316
00:17:30.771 --> 00:17:34.160
The British lost less than 20 men but killed hundreds of Zulus,

317
00:17:34.610 --> 00:17:36.830
the British per and the royal house of catch whale.

318
00:17:36.830 --> 00:17:41.090
And in fact much of the city at this point,
they had essentially won the war.

319
00:17:41.270 --> 00:17:43.580
Woolsey would soon take a man of the army.

320
00:17:43.640 --> 00:17:48.200
Now all that was left was to mop up the final hostile groups of Zulus and locate

321
00:17:48.201 --> 00:17:50.010
king catch weyeah who was now hiding.

322
00:17:50.220 --> 00:17:53.730
He was finally discovered on August 28th and sent back to Britain.

323
00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:56.520
Wellesley then began subjugating the Zulu kingdom,

324
00:17:56.521 --> 00:17:58.920
dividing it up into 13 different districts,

325
00:17:58.980 --> 00:18:02.510
which were forbidden from a uniting and can show was returned to pseudo lands

326
00:18:02.540 --> 00:18:05.970
some years later to serve as a king,
but died one year later.

327
00:18:06.090 --> 00:18:09.990
This war was a small part in Britain's quest to dominate South Africa.

328
00:18:10.290 --> 00:18:11.490
The Zulus where to feed,

329
00:18:11.491 --> 00:18:14.670
but the bar republics would still remain enemies of the British until the early

330
00:18:14.671 --> 00:18:16.920
20th century becoming bolder and braver,

331
00:18:16.921 --> 00:18:20.190
not the Zulu threat had been eliminated and years to come.

332
00:18:20.191 --> 00:18:23.250
All of Africa would face capitulation to European powers.

333
00:18:23.430 --> 00:18:26.960
Britain's grip over the area of a Titan as the Germans took interest in south of

334
00:18:26.961 --> 00:18:27.794
West Africa,

335
00:18:27.870 --> 00:18:31.530
the Portuguese extended control and Mozambique and the French occupied

336
00:18:31.531 --> 00:18:32.364
Madagascar.

337
00:18:32.430 --> 00:18:35.790
The British colonies here would eventually develop into the modern nation of

338
00:18:35.791 --> 00:18:38.520
South Africa,
mixed with influence from the bores,

339
00:18:38.521 --> 00:18:41.310
and of course the Zulu people who continue to this day.

340
00:18:41.580 --> 00:18:44.310
I leave you to be the moral judges of this war and the outcome,

341
00:18:44.580 --> 00:18:47.490
the effects of which are still called today from over here is like this and

342
00:18:47.491 --> 00:18:48.840
videos and many other subjects we should,

343
00:18:48.841 --> 00:18:51.810
which I got fire of learning and subscribe.
Thank you for watching.
