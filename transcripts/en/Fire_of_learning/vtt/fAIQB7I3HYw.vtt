1
00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:15.200
First officer is one of the most beloved and important characters in all of Star

2
00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:16.050
Trek.
In my view,

3
00:00:16.051 --> 00:00:18.860
Spock is not just important to star trek because of his position as first

4
00:00:18.861 --> 00:00:21.590
officer,
but because of what he's mentality,
decision making,

5
00:00:21.591 --> 00:00:25.400
process in personality,
offer his insight into the human condition.

6
00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:28.340
Spach clearly favors strongly.

7
00:00:28.341 --> 00:00:31.570
He's Vulcan haven't x is it as expected for Vulcanus to act?

8
00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:34.010
He is very purely coldly logical.

9
00:00:34.011 --> 00:00:37.640
He doesn't have much respect for things that are based on emotion,
tradition,

10
00:00:37.641 --> 00:00:42.320
intuition,
or other imperfect mentalities.
Viewing them as vapid and whimsical.

11
00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:45.890
The creators that have very good job with contrast and him with Dr. McCoy who

12
00:00:45.891 --> 00:00:49.400
typically jumps to make decisions based on what is morally correct and Kirk,

13
00:00:49.401 --> 00:00:54.320
who as captain must make decisions based on both arguments and at times on a

14
00:00:54.321 --> 00:00:57.700
dime,
but also with his own intuitive feelings that come with being a captain,

15
00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:00.740
which both Mr Spock and document coy may at times lack,

16
00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:06.110
at least in the original TV shows and movies.
Jj Abrams Spock is,
well,

17
00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:08.180
we don't have to focus on that version right now.

18
00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:12.250
Spock's code of decision making based on a logical analysis of the components of

19
00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:13.850
something you can go many ways for him.

20
00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:17.590
There are many times throughout the show where Spock is to show off his brain

21
00:01:17.591 --> 00:01:20.840
power and willpower in front of the capricious emotional humans

22
00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:23.970
<v 2>approvable.
You'd make a splendid computer and this just one</v>

23
00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:27.050
that is very kind of you captain

24
00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:30.080
<v 1>in high stakes circumstances where the crew is in danger.</v>

25
00:01:30.081 --> 00:01:33.440
Many of the crew members may suffer emotional outbursts which can impede their

26
00:01:33.441 --> 00:01:37.490
abilities.
Spock,
on the other hand shows the value of being able to remain cool,

27
00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.911
calm,

28
00:01:37.911 --> 00:01:42.050
and collected in high stakes circumstances and be able to control your emotions

29
00:01:42.051 --> 00:01:43.850
from getting in the way of what makes sense.

30
00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:47.290
<v 3>Raising my voice back there,
it doesn't mean I was scared</v>

31
00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:53.590
to have a human thing called an adrenaline sound,
most inconvenient,

32
00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:55.270
considered having it removed.

33
00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:59.900
<v 1>Spock again being without what he considers emotional drawbacks at times arrived</v>

34
00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:02.210
to conclusions which the crew,
but more importantly,

35
00:02:02.211 --> 00:02:05.720
the audience may disagree with it.
First being contrary to human nature.

36
00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:09.620
Spock then demonstrates the usefulness of training yourself to use your brains

37
00:02:09.621 --> 00:02:13.010
to overcome situations which might overwhelm you.
Otherwise.

38
00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.620
His victories are allegories of our own tribes,

39
00:02:15.621 --> 00:02:18.740
over our passions and motions and animalistic instincts,

40
00:02:18.741 --> 00:02:20.450
which would potentially do us harm.

41
00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:25.240
<v 2>Get us out.
Once we are,
we're unification will become a fact of life.</v>

42
00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:30.880
I will not read this or any other statement.
If you do not,

43
00:02:30.881 --> 00:02:32.890
you will die.
All of you will die.

44
00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:37.770
Since it is logical to conclude that you will kill us in any event,

45
00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:42.850
I choose not to cooperate.
I hate guns.

46
00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:46.220
<v 1>That clip in particular is one of my favorite from the whole show.</v>

47
00:02:46.221 --> 00:02:47.001
For whatever reason,

48
00:02:47.001 --> 00:02:52.001
that kind of reasoning is lacking in fictional stories and even the real world.

49
00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:56.150
However,
Spock is not always right and sometimes being logical,

50
00:02:56.151 --> 00:02:59.060
it can get you into trouble.
In a world that is not logical.

51
00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:01.030
Spock is chosen the Vulcan way of life,

52
00:03:01.031 --> 00:03:05.260
but he is still half human and deep down has more emotions than the average book

53
00:03:05.261 --> 00:03:08.860
and accordingly,
with as many successes come,
moments where Spock fails,

54
00:03:08.861 --> 00:03:12.880
when facing situations in which is emotions are compromised or when the crew was

55
00:03:12.881 --> 00:03:16.780
Minda decision based on arguments outside of empirical data such as intuitive

56
00:03:16.781 --> 00:03:21.070
feeling these decisions with which Spock would have originally disagreed
turnout,

57
00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:24.670
sometimes it'd be the correct decisions after all sparked doesn't show much

58
00:03:24.671 --> 00:03:28.420
concern for the citizens made by Kirk Macquire Scotty because they feel

59
00:03:28.421 --> 00:03:29.020
something is off.

60
00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:32.620
But many episodes of the show demonstrate the value of this intuition as well.

61
00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:35.950
This is also symbolic of events we face in our daily lives.

62
00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:39.190
Sometimes we just don't have empirical data to make a decision,

63
00:03:39.191 --> 00:03:41.170
especially a pressing major decisions.

64
00:03:41.171 --> 00:03:44.170
So we have to gamble on subjectivity and intuitive feelings.

65
00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:45.370
It's a gamble for sure,

66
00:03:45.371 --> 00:03:48.760
but relying on statistics alone can get you killed out in space and Spock

67
00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:52.480
equally owes his life was human counterparts.
As for emotion.

68
00:03:52.481 --> 00:03:56.440
There was a clear reason that in many episodes Spock has to come face to face

69
00:03:56.441 --> 00:04:00.550
with him.
His emotions.
Logic is in reality,
not an end in itself.

70
00:04:00.551 --> 00:04:03.850
Logic is a tool to achieve a state of,
as Aristotle put it,

71
00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:08.470
goodness or wellbeing,
which is arguably an emotional state,
being content,

72
00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:11.770
healthy,
joyful,
successful,
satisfied,
et cetera.

73
00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:16.540
We may view responding to incidents with emotional outbursts and called logic as

74
00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:21.070
very different,
but the end goal is the same.
The feeling of goodness.

75
00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:25.090
Logic is simply more complex tool to achieve generally higher levels of this

76
00:04:25.091 --> 00:04:26.680
good for lack of a better term,

77
00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:31.030
Spock represents the optimistic view towards mankind to star trek held.

78
00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:33.340
He is cold,
orderly and computer like,

79
00:04:33.341 --> 00:04:36.940
but deep down he has a heart and throughout the series he triumphs with his

80
00:04:36.941 --> 00:04:40.630
logical abilities but struggles to overcome this emotional weakness in his

81
00:04:40.631 --> 00:04:42.310
vulnerabilities.
Likewise,

82
00:04:42.311 --> 00:04:46.450
humans who are emotional beings must not only learn the value of impartial

83
00:04:46.451 --> 00:04:48.970
decision making mass to the utilization of logic,

84
00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.690
but they also must gain control of their inherently absurd emotions and find a

85
00:04:52.691 --> 00:04:57.130
balance between the two and not shut one or the other out to build an ideal

86
00:04:57.131 --> 00:04:59.770
world and reach an ideal state of being.

87
00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:02.560
Our emotions may not make sense to and it'd be archaic.

88
00:05:02.561 --> 00:05:05.380
Tools are for survival dating back to our primitive days,

89
00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:09.130
but they're there whether we like it or not and we have to mature them and

90
00:05:09.131 --> 00:05:09.964
recognize them.

91
00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:14.080
What the Spock consider the ultimate good then to what end does utilize this

92
00:05:14.081 --> 00:05:17.020
logic?
Well,
Spock is very clearly utilitarian.

93
00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:20.650
Utilitarians are essentially concerned with making decisions that will benefit

94
00:05:20.651 --> 00:05:21.820
the majority of people.

95
00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:25.510
Spock is selfless and ways decisions based on how they would affect the whole

96
00:05:25.511 --> 00:05:28.180
universe and all its inhabitants.
In the wrath of Khan,

97
00:05:28.181 --> 00:05:29.560
he states his famous phrase

98
00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:34.070
<v 4>logic clearly dictates that the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few.</v>

99
00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:39.350
<v 1>Spoiler alert here for the wrath of Khan.
Spock isn't just saying this side,</v>

100
00:05:39.351 --> 00:05:40.940
I would Spock says he means,

101
00:05:40.941 --> 00:05:44.450
and he demonstrates this to the ultimate degree when he sacrifices himself for

102
00:05:44.451 --> 00:05:47.810
the wellbeing of the ship after all of Star Trek.

103
00:05:47.811 --> 00:05:51.800
Remember the original Spock's final advice to himself,

104
00:05:51.801 --> 00:05:53.270
but to us as well.

105
00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.620
<v 4>Squad.
In this case,
the jury is shelf a favor,</v>

106
00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:02.480
<v 5>put her side logic to what feels right.</v>

107
00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:08.851
<v 1>So in essence,</v>

108
00:06:08.851 --> 00:06:12.580
Fox character has many purposes and displays many parts of the human condition

109
00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:16.990
as star trek has always,
always attempted to do.
He is a utilitarian.

110
00:06:16.991 --> 00:06:20.920
Advocating for decisions are the most useful to the most people is logical

111
00:06:20.921 --> 00:06:24.910
abilities or portrayals of the benefits of being able to maintain discipline and

112
00:06:24.911 --> 00:06:26.770
develop the power to make decisions,

113
00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:31.090
especially emotionally uncomfortable decisions which will be the most beneficial

114
00:06:31.091 --> 00:06:34.780
in the long run or even save your life on the other side.
However,

115
00:06:34.781 --> 00:06:37.510
his faults show that logic is not always the answer,

116
00:06:37.511 --> 00:06:40.990
especially not in a world belt somewhat illogically.

117
00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:44.590
Empirical data is best for science,
but in a split second decision,

118
00:06:44.591 --> 00:06:46.990
if you forgo your intuition in favor of it,

119
00:06:47.410 --> 00:06:49.600
you could lose your head for more videos.

120
00:06:49.601 --> 00:06:51.130
Like this and videos on many other subjects.

121

Be sure to check a fire of learning and subscribe.

122
00:06:53.650 --> 00:06:55.420
Thank you for watching and of course,

123
00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:57.180
<v 5>live long and prosper.</v>
