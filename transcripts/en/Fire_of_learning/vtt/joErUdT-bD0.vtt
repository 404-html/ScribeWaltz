00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:04.680
England is a nation which has had a significant impact on and in fact has played

2
00:00:04.681 --> 00:00:08.160
a significant role in shaping human civilization for hundreds of years.

3
00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:09.420
And today in this video,

4
00:00:09.421 --> 00:00:12.660
we're going to take a look at that history and explore just what England is,

5
00:00:12.661 --> 00:00:13.530
who his people are,

6
00:00:13.531 --> 00:00:17.520
and how it became the world's changing nation that it is today.
So to start,

7
00:00:17.521 --> 00:00:19.590
you have to know exactly what England is.

8
00:00:19.591 --> 00:00:21.180
And I'm guessing if you clicked on this video,

9
00:00:21.181 --> 00:00:24.120
you've probably heard of England before and that's great.

10
00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:27.990
But a lot of people don't know the difference between England and Britain or

11
00:00:27.991 --> 00:00:31.350
England and the United Kingdom and things like that.
So really quickly here,

12
00:00:31.351 --> 00:00:35.700
here's the island that we call a Great Britain.
The term great isn't about ego,

13
00:00:35.701 --> 00:00:38.310
it's about geography.
Here is England.

14
00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:43.430
It's important to understand Scotland here and whales here are also British.

15
00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:47.220
This whole thing is Britain.
So while all English or British,

16
00:00:47.221 --> 00:00:48.390
not all British or English,

17
00:00:48.391 --> 00:00:51.720
it confusion typically comes from the fact that today these three countries are

18
00:00:51.721 --> 00:00:54.630
all United into one single country.
The United Kingdom,

19
00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.230
which also includes Northern Ireland and use to include the rest of Ireland for

20
00:00:58.231 --> 00:01:00.000
reasons that we'll get into today.

21
00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:03.090
But because England is a seat of the union is seat of the kingdom,

22
00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:06.510
the term British is often mistakenly only applied it to England.

23
00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.140
So with that out of the way,
let's focus on that part of the island,

24
00:01:10.141 --> 00:01:13.710
which we call England and let's go back a little over 2000 years.

25
00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.790
At this time England was inhabited by various Celtic tribes,
not Celtic,

26
00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.630
Celtic compared to the Mediterranean nations of Europe around at a time such as

27
00:01:21.631 --> 00:01:23.790
the Romans.
The people here were a primitive though,

28
00:01:23.791 --> 00:01:25.710
not as primitive as you would imagine.

29
00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:29.910
The Celtic tribal societies of early England were fairly complex agricultural

30
00:01:29.911 --> 00:01:30.420
societies.

31
00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.350
They were in contact with the European mainland and on the bright side of this

32
00:01:34.351 --> 00:01:38.460
trade made its way to and from pre Roman England,
but I'm a dark side.

33
00:01:38.461 --> 00:01:41.910
They were at times invaded by tribes from the European mainland.

34
00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.820
Though they all spoke a similar language and fall,
a similar religion,

35
00:01:44.821 --> 00:01:48.750
which was a predecessor of modern Celtic languages such as Welsh for example.

36
00:01:48.751 --> 00:01:52.350
They were not United society as a people.
Accordingly,
of course,

37
00:01:52.351 --> 00:01:54.690
they wage war with each other during those wars.

38
00:01:54.691 --> 00:01:57.660
They would build defensive structure as much like the one shown here called

39
00:01:57.661 --> 00:02:01.290
maiden castle dating back long before the Romans even arrived on the island.

40
00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:04.620
The religion practiced here with similar to much of Northwestern Europe at the

41
00:02:04.621 --> 00:02:05.281
time.
In fact,

42
00:02:05.281 --> 00:02:08.010
the Romans noted that the religion that they practice in England was very

43
00:02:08.011 --> 00:02:12.180
similar to the one which they practice and gall also known as modern France.

44
00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:13.680
It was a pagan religion,

45
00:02:13.681 --> 00:02:17.130
but what's very interesting about it to most people is the druidism that was

46
00:02:17.131 --> 00:02:21.060
practiced here and and the rest of Britain and Ireland as well as the druids

47
00:02:21.061 --> 00:02:22.710
were unique to the British isles.

48
00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:25.200
The jurors were a very interesting group of people.

49
00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.500
They were religious authorities of course,
but they weren't just priest.

50
00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:31.860
They were also politically involved as they were doctors.
They were judges,

51
00:02:31.861 --> 00:02:34.680
they were historians,
they were advisors,
things like that.

52
00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:38.970
They were a very much a group of elite and Iron Age England and their opinion

53
00:02:38.971 --> 00:02:41.580
had considerable impact on the early societies here.

54
00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:46.380
Much of what we know about the societies of this time comes to us from the

55
00:02:46.381 --> 00:02:50.310
Romans and their records of the island and we see evidence of the impacts that

56
00:02:50.311 --> 00:02:51.870
the jury has had on our society.

57
00:02:51.871 --> 00:02:54.870
When the Romans do you come to the island that they call for Tanya.

58
00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:58.800
Now it's fair to have mixed opinions on the religion that was practiced here and

59
00:02:58.801 --> 00:03:01.900
throughout rest of the British isles called simply Celtic paganism.

60
00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:06.130
There was some human sacrifice involved,
which is to most of us today,

61
00:03:06.131 --> 00:03:08.620
pretty abhorrent.
The Romans back then didn't like it either.

62
00:03:08.621 --> 00:03:09.910
They were appalled by it.

63
00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:14.230
They discussed how horrendous it was that the Celts would do such a thing during

64
00:03:14.231 --> 00:03:17.020
their gladiator fights and we've actually found some evidence of this human

65
00:03:17.021 --> 00:03:19.150
sacrifice in the United Kingdom and Ireland.

66
00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:23.530
This is a picture of a decently preserved corpse of an individual who was a part

67
00:03:23.531 --> 00:03:26.890
of these practices from these times.
I believe this individual is from Ireland.

68
00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:28.660
On the upside though,
as I've explained before,

69
00:03:28.661 --> 00:03:32.620
the Pagan Celtic beliefs stuck around in various ways to influence us today.

70
00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:36.550
The most notable example is perhaps Halloween at Celtic night of Shaaban,

71
00:03:36.551 --> 00:03:39.730
which was Christianized and then became modernize to the holiday that we know

72
00:03:39.731 --> 00:03:43.570
today there was no writing in a society and in fact the druids when confronted

73
00:03:43.571 --> 00:03:45.010
with writing,
we're fine without it.

74
00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:47.820
They claim that writing things down was bad for your memory.

75
00:03:47.821 --> 00:03:51.100
So a lot of what we know about England at this time comes to us from

76
00:03:51.101 --> 00:03:53.140
archeological finds or as I said,

77
00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:57.040
the accounts of the Romans and it isn't and it is when the Romans invade Britain

78
00:03:57.070 --> 00:04:01.960
that we really get to understand the world here.
At the time in 55 BC,

79
00:04:01.961 --> 00:04:05.140
Julius Caesar invaded Britain and again in 54 BC,

80
00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:08.350
but he was unsuccessful both times essentially getting no territory.

81
00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:11.710
Part of the justification he had four invading island was that the people of

82
00:04:11.711 --> 00:04:14.980
this region had assisted the Gauls against Rome due to their economic

83
00:04:14.981 --> 00:04:17.860
relationship with him.
They're both cal state Los related to each other.

84
00:04:17.861 --> 00:04:19.090
They trade it and things like that.

85
00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:22.360
Remember also that I said that the British tribes were not isolated from the

86
00:04:22.361 --> 00:04:24.190
rest of Europe like one might think they were,

87
00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:29.280
but the true age of Roman Britain comes about 90 years later and 43 [inaudible]

88
00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:34.210
40,000 Roman soldiers set sail from the province of the gall to invade the

89
00:04:34.211 --> 00:04:34.931
island.
Now,

90
00:04:34.931 --> 00:04:38.230
there were a number of obvious benefits to be obtained from invading and

91
00:04:38.231 --> 00:04:43.231
capitulating for Tanya trade and resources and the expansion of the empire and

92
00:04:43.451 --> 00:04:43.721
all that,

93
00:04:43.721 --> 00:04:47.680
but a huge motivation here was that the emperor at the time wanted to improve

94
00:04:47.681 --> 00:04:48.514
his image.

95
00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:52.930
Emperor Claudius came to become emperor and he was quite justifiably insecure.

96
00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:57.960
He was seen as kind of weak and even moronic by his peers and by the population.

97
00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:01.390
He thought that if he could go to Britain and conquer it and affect what we do,

98
00:05:01.391 --> 00:05:05.590
what Julius Caesar did not do,
he would bolster his image quite significantly.

99
00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:09.070
And so he ordered the operation and put his brother in law and command of it.

100
00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:12.920
The Roman soldiers were admittedly frightened by this prospect before they left.

101
00:05:12.921 --> 00:05:15.100
The records tell us that the morale was kind of low.

102
00:05:15.101 --> 00:05:17.770
Britain at this time was the edge of the unknown,

103
00:05:17.771 --> 00:05:21.670
so they were obviously very scared.
They were concerned that the island,
Harvard,

104
00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:24.970
ferocious,
ferocious savages and demons and such things.

105
00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:29.740
Morale though did change and the Romans set sail for Britain lending and Modern

106
00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:30.070
Day Kent.

107
00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:33.550
Unfortunately for the native Britons though when the Roman is land and they made

108
00:05:33.551 --> 00:05:34.210
a mistake,

109
00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:37.480
the Britains actually caught wind of the fear among the Romans and assume that

110
00:05:37.481 --> 00:05:39.880
there would be a mutiny before the Romans could land.

111
00:05:39.881 --> 00:05:43.480
So one of the most powerful tribes on the island and the kind of Aillani did not

112
00:05:43.481 --> 00:05:45.310
make a proper move to defend the shore.

113
00:05:45.311 --> 00:05:49.450
They simply assume the invasion will dissolve before it arrived,
but it did not.

114
00:05:49.451 --> 00:05:53.410
And the Romans lended and establish a fort and even a triumphal arch eventually

115
00:05:53.411 --> 00:05:56.290
in such things,
and then they pressed into the rest of the island.

116
00:05:56.350 --> 00:05:59.330
Now there was obviously a good deal of conflict as the Romans pressed in to the

117
00:05:59.331 --> 00:06:00.170
rest of her.
Tanya,

118
00:06:00.171 --> 00:06:03.380
there were at times a number of revolts amongst occupied tribes,

119
00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:06.530
but a significant amount of tribes,
about 11 in fact,

120
00:06:06.531 --> 00:06:09.950
actually surrender to the Romans during this time before conflict even emerged.

121
00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:14.270
Why?
Well,
the Roman military machine,
as historians optim refer to it,

122
00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:17.900
was simply too powerful.
The Romans were susceptible to guerrilla warfare,

123
00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:18.291
of course,

124
00:06:18.291 --> 00:06:22.010
but out on the open field to tribes like those in Britain at the time did not

125
00:06:22.011 --> 00:06:25.970
have much of a chance to bolster this image of being a powerful and unstoppable

126
00:06:25.971 --> 00:06:28.730
invasion force from Claudius actually comes to visit Britain.

127
00:06:28.731 --> 00:06:30.170
He enters on an elephant,

128
00:06:30.171 --> 00:06:32.930
a beast which the people of this region had obviously never seen before.

129
00:06:32.931 --> 00:06:34.280
They were astonished.

130
00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:38.540
Roman occupation sets in and Tanya modern dating England again becomes a

131
00:06:38.541 --> 00:06:41.450
province at defining moment in early English history.

132
00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:44.780
Not everyone is so satisfied with being occupied.
However,

133
00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:48.650
Boudica a woman of the ice,
any tribe in particular was not satisfied.

134
00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:52.430
Boudica was the wife of a very important tribal figure who maintain an alliance

135
00:06:52.431 --> 00:06:56.180
with the Romans.
However,
after her husband's death,
the Romans turned on them.

136
00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:59.450
She was beaten and her two daughters who were raped and incident that she did

137
00:06:59.451 --> 00:07:04.451
not easily forget around 60 Aidy Boudica gathered forces from multiple British

138
00:07:04.461 --> 00:07:08.060
tribes,
primarily the Ice Sonny and avant Hays as well,
some others,

139
00:07:08.210 --> 00:07:12.050
and led a revolt against the Romans.
The revolt was not a minor incident.

140
00:07:12.051 --> 00:07:15.680
Her forces would cause extreme chaos in the province that she killed thousands

141
00:07:15.681 --> 00:07:19.580
of inhabitants and burned down three cities including London,
indium,

142
00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:21.320
if that name sounds familiar to you,

143
00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:24.860
the situation was becoming so extreme that the emperor at the time,

144
00:07:24.861 --> 00:07:28.460
Nero considered withdrawing from Britain entirely.
However,

145
00:07:28.461 --> 00:07:32.060
Boudica was eventually defeated.
She was never captured by the Romans.

146
00:07:32.061 --> 00:07:36.200
Rather it was likely that she committed suicide who avoid capitulation following

147
00:07:36.201 --> 00:07:38.450
this incident,
Britannia was firmly Roman.

148
00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:42.080
The Romans would hold on to this province until four ten eight d.

149
00:07:42.170 --> 00:07:45.980
Now talking about history so far back,
that might not seem like such a long time,

150
00:07:45.981 --> 00:07:48.560
but keep in mind that was 350 years.

151
00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:52.190
The United States today for comparison is only 241 years old,

152
00:07:52.191 --> 00:07:53.990
so it was a decent span of time.

153
00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:57.830
So after that fairly turbulent time period of conflict with the picks of the

154
00:07:57.831 --> 00:08:00.020
north and other rebellions and disorder and such things,

155
00:08:00.021 --> 00:08:02.390
Rome starts to become weakened and it's homeland.

156
00:08:02.420 --> 00:08:06.530
It simply can't afford to spare troops or supplies to defend this and provinces

157
00:08:06.531 --> 00:08:07.364
like per Tanya.

158
00:08:07.670 --> 00:08:11.570
So when Rome starts to become weakened and the province starts to face threats

159
00:08:11.571 --> 00:08:13.720
from the picks and the dramatic tribe is threatening Britain,

160
00:08:13.740 --> 00:08:17.270
the emperor or notorious,
basically it tells them that they're on their own,

161
00:08:17.390 --> 00:08:19.220
which was shocking to the British people.

162
00:08:19.221 --> 00:08:24.020
And the Roman empire just altogether fell 66 years later though the Romans had

163
00:08:24.021 --> 00:08:25.250
technically left Britain.

164
00:08:25.340 --> 00:08:28.160
It's important to consider what the Romans had left behind at this point.

165
00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:30.350
Roads and infrastructure,
cities like London,

166
00:08:30.351 --> 00:08:32.870
Manchester and New York and of course Christianity,

167
00:08:32.871 --> 00:08:35.000
which will play a major role in English history.

168
00:08:35.420 --> 00:08:39.080
And following the fall of Roman empire,
we begin to see a rise from this reveled,

169
00:08:39.100 --> 00:08:42.800
the beginning of what will be eventually called England but not quite yet

170
00:08:43.310 --> 00:08:44.001
following fort to.

171
00:08:44.001 --> 00:08:47.750
And it's not like as soon as the Roman military left that the British society is

172
00:08:47.751 --> 00:08:52.220
suddenly reverted back to his pre Roman state was of course still Roman Britain.

173
00:08:52.610 --> 00:08:54.440
They were,
Socrates still held his power.

174
00:08:54.441 --> 00:08:57.090
The structure was still roaming the Britains,
we're still Christians,

175
00:08:57.091 --> 00:08:59.460
a lot more was still spoken,
et Cetera,
et cetera.

176
00:08:59.610 --> 00:09:02.820
What had happened was that the Britains were just suddenly given self rule

177
00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:05.550
mostly against their wishes,
but it was what they were stuck with.

178
00:09:05.610 --> 00:09:08.700
They pleaded multiple times for the Romans had come back following for 10 but

179
00:09:08.701 --> 00:09:10.140
now with no such thing happening,

180
00:09:10.141 --> 00:09:14.190
they set up their own military and defense modeled of course off rums.

181
00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:16.770
So even though the Roman Empire is a gone,

182
00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:20.370
these people are still identifying as Romans,
Romans to sidle structure,

183
00:09:20.371 --> 00:09:21.840
as I said,
is still in place.

184
00:09:21.841 --> 00:09:24.780
And that will continue even after the Roman empire has fallen,

185
00:09:25.410 --> 00:09:27.270
despite their efforts to defend themselves.

186
00:09:27.271 --> 00:09:30.030
They're not very successful picks from Scotland,

187
00:09:30.031 --> 00:09:32.760
Irish from Ireland and other raters tear apart the country.

188
00:09:32.850 --> 00:09:36.960
So the people of former Roman Britain come up with a very Roman solution to the

189
00:09:36.961 --> 00:09:40.140
issue,
hire mercenaries to deal with it.
And that's what they do.

190
00:09:40.380 --> 00:09:43.500
They hire a group of very effective mercenaries that had already been fighting

191
00:09:43.501 --> 00:09:47.790
on the side of the Romans as mercenaries from northern Germany known as the

192
00:09:47.790 --> 00:09:48.060
Anglo Saxons.

193
00:09:48.060 --> 00:09:51.510
Three ships of these people are sent over to deal with the picks and deal with

194
00:09:51.511 --> 00:09:53.250
them.
They do indeed.
The picks are deep.

195
00:09:53.430 --> 00:09:57.330
They're badly to feed and driven back into modern day Scotland as tribute for

196
00:09:57.331 --> 00:10:00.720
the service to Britain's give the sex in some land in modern day Kent,

197
00:10:00.721 --> 00:10:03.510
which leads to many more sections coming over to settled in Atlanta.

198
00:10:03.540 --> 00:10:04.830
Thousands of them,
in fact,

199
00:10:04.890 --> 00:10:07.410
and it's not just warrior mercenaries coming over anymore,

200
00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:11.040
it's women and children and that means they're saying,
adding onto this,

201
00:10:11.041 --> 00:10:14.640
it's entirely likely that the Anglo Saxons and other north dramatic peoples had

202
00:10:14.641 --> 00:10:17.850
already been living on the island for a while before all these incidents.

203
00:10:17.910 --> 00:10:18.810
Unfortunately though,

204
00:10:18.811 --> 00:10:22.530
after the picks are dealt with the Britains discover that the Saxons aren't very

205
00:10:22.531 --> 00:10:25.320
good neighbors,
they're pagans,
they're considerably different.

206
00:10:25.321 --> 00:10:28.170
They don't see eye to eye on a number of things and eventually the whole thing

207
00:10:28.171 --> 00:10:31.110
backfires on the Britain's and the Saxons invade them.

208
00:10:31.230 --> 00:10:35.280
Conflict erupts and the British are led by a leader named Ambroziak or really

209
00:10:35.281 --> 00:10:38.610
honest or Romano Britain considered to be one of the last Romans,

210
00:10:38.850 --> 00:10:43.850
and so the two sides go to war over what will become England eventually after a

211
00:10:44.101 --> 00:10:44.881
sustained war.

212
00:10:44.881 --> 00:10:49.260
The two sites meet at the battle of Mons bad economists around the year 500

213
00:10:49.261 --> 00:10:52.770
probably near the modern city of bath.
This is a very important battle.

214
00:10:52.771 --> 00:10:56.580
It's here that the Britains finally defeat the Saxons and secure their existence

215
00:10:56.581 --> 00:10:58.980
against total domination.
Following this battle,

216
00:10:58.981 --> 00:11:03.390
the sections are left with the east of England where the develop around 30

217
00:11:03.391 --> 00:11:06.450
kingdoms to the West.
Though the Britains actually keep on living.

218
00:11:06.660 --> 00:11:09.750
Their land is named after the Saxon word for foreigner.

219
00:11:10.020 --> 00:11:14.910
Whales is during this conflict also that we begin to hear legends of King Arthur

220
00:11:14.911 --> 00:11:18.120
and in fact it's said that a figure known as Arthur was responsible for the

221
00:11:18.121 --> 00:11:22.110
British picture you at the battle of Mons bad economists and also for the long

222
00:11:22.111 --> 00:11:27.090
period of peace with the Saxons,
which followed.
How much of this legend is true?

223
00:11:27.091 --> 00:11:30.480
Well,
what really happened in detail is pretty unclear.

224
00:11:30.481 --> 00:11:33.980
Obviously these major events and territorial changes in battles and such things

225
00:11:34.010 --> 00:11:37.620
really did happen,
but it probably wasn't as much of a solidifying,

226
00:11:37.621 --> 00:11:42.600
clean cut and the vision between Britain's in Saxons as tales tend to tell.

227
00:11:43.170 --> 00:11:43.620
In fact,

228
00:11:43.620 --> 00:11:47.460
probably a lot of Britain's just assimilated into Saks and culture as they were

229
00:11:47.461 --> 00:11:50.100
invaded and more sex and immigrated to the new land.

230
00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:53.860
King Arthur May have been real.
He may represent an actual figure.

231
00:11:53.861 --> 00:11:56.890
Again though the truth remains unfortunately unclear,

232
00:11:57.070 --> 00:11:59.970
but historians are emphasizing that following this conflict inside you,

233
00:11:59.971 --> 00:12:04.971
it wasn't as much of as Saxon invasion as it was a Saxon migration as evidenced

234
00:12:05.921 --> 00:12:09.070
in fact of Saxenda the Britains living together in circumstance certain

235
00:12:09.071 --> 00:12:12.910
circumstances and just eventually the Britons who did not go to Wales just kind

236
00:12:12.911 --> 00:12:17.710
of adapted to the dominant sacks and culture and language and traditions and

237
00:12:17.711 --> 00:12:18.430
things like that.

238
00:12:18.430 --> 00:12:21.880
The angles in the Saxons were just two of the North's dramatic people to settle

239
00:12:21.881 --> 00:12:22.211
England.

240
00:12:22.211 --> 00:12:26.440
They were also primarily joined by the Jews and some DNA evidence suggested the

241
00:12:26.441 --> 00:12:28.870
free agents from Modern Day Holland to join them as well.

242
00:12:28.990 --> 00:12:32.500
These tribes followed very similar religions and very likely spoke very similar

243
00:12:32.501 --> 00:12:36.010
languages and in fact they had little difficulty communicating with each other

244
00:12:36.250 --> 00:12:36.911
through time.

245
00:12:36.911 --> 00:12:40.390
These Germanic tribes would cease to think of themselves as different from each

246
00:12:40.391 --> 00:12:42.160
other and reach a point of integration.

247
00:12:42.161 --> 00:12:46.240
At which point they would simply prefer to call themselves the Anglo Saxons or

248
00:12:46.241 --> 00:12:48.400
in their Anglo Saxon language Anglican.

249
00:12:48.460 --> 00:12:53.380
Why not sex ish or sex link considering the great importance of this accident

250
00:12:53.381 --> 00:12:57.610
tribe?
Well,
again,
the gradual integration made the distinction less important.

251
00:12:58.030 --> 00:13:00.910
Interesting to note though,
even today in many Celtic languages,

252
00:13:00.911 --> 00:13:05.290
the name for England is still based off to sacs and people.
Shoshana,
for example,

253
00:13:05.291 --> 00:13:06.370
in modern Irish,

254
00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:10.750
the 400 or so years following the Roman Empire is fall is a period marked by

255
00:13:10.751 --> 00:13:14.440
very large migrations of people across the Europe in general and England

256
00:13:14.441 --> 00:13:18.580
continued to absorb immigrants from northern Germania,

257
00:13:18.580 --> 00:13:21.790
Anglo Saxon England through the 500 so the 880 it was ruled by scores of

258
00:13:21.791 --> 00:13:25.450
kingdoms and a very turbulent and admittedly confusing landscape and in fact

259
00:13:25.451 --> 00:13:27.310
it's not just confusing to us today.

260
00:13:27.430 --> 00:13:30.460
There's reports of foreigners from the mainland being confused by it.

261
00:13:30.730 --> 00:13:33.490
The names of some kingdoms in fact are lost to history,

262
00:13:33.491 --> 00:13:38.050
but the major ones included ones such as Kent,
Wessex,
Sussex Mircea,

263
00:13:38.110 --> 00:13:41.140
and North Umbria.
Throughout the seventh century,

264
00:13:41.250 --> 00:13:44.290
the Anglo Saxon people began to convert to Christianity.

265
00:13:44.560 --> 00:13:47.680
The remnants of this conversion lasts to this day,

266
00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:50.200
though the Roman empire had fallen to pagan invaders.

267
00:13:50.220 --> 00:13:54.100
That his sentence of these pagans across Europe did in fact end up obviously

268
00:13:54.101 --> 00:13:58.270
converting to Christianity and pressures from the mainland whales and also

269
00:13:58.271 --> 00:14:00.410
Ireland,
which had already been converted to Christianity.

270
00:14:00.411 --> 00:14:04.360
He led to the Anglo Saxons adopting the religion as well and through

271
00:14:04.361 --> 00:14:07.780
Christianity they connected themselves to the larger European picture in a

272
00:14:07.781 --> 00:14:12.430
critical time when post Roman Europe was forming the spike conflicts and lack of

273
00:14:12.431 --> 00:14:14.230
political unity among the early English,

274
00:14:14.231 --> 00:14:17.620
this was a time of economic stability and prosperity.

275
00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:22.270
It was a time period in which Anglo Saxon language,
religion,
culture,
society,

276
00:14:22.271 --> 00:14:24.250
and such things could begin to take root.

277
00:14:24.340 --> 00:14:28.180
Unfortunately at the same time that the Anglo sex and we were taking root in

278
00:14:28.181 --> 00:14:32.470
England,
another force not far from their island was beginning to take flight.

279
00:14:32.770 --> 00:14:34.630
Our forest,
which due to geography,

280
00:14:34.631 --> 00:14:37.840
the English would bear the full brunt up and that's for us would permanently

281
00:14:37.841 --> 00:14:40.120
altered the course of English development.

282
00:14:40.360 --> 00:14:43.720
This forced developing in modern day Denmark,
Sweden and Norway.

283
00:14:43.721 --> 00:14:47.260
We know today as the vikings,
to elaborate a little bit here,

284
00:14:47.261 --> 00:14:51.220
the word Viking more correctly refers not to the Norse people,

285
00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:55.940
but to the Norris Raiders and explorers who wrecked havoc on Europe for over 250

286
00:14:55.941 --> 00:14:56.211
years.

287
00:14:56.211 --> 00:15:01.211
A period known as the Viking Age and England would be forever changed by it and

288
00:15:01.521 --> 00:15:05.510
in fact the viking age would begin and England off the coast of North Umbria on

289
00:15:05.511 --> 00:15:07.870
an island known as Lindisfarne not,

290
00:15:07.880 --> 00:15:10.100
we've already talked about the vikings on this channel before,

291
00:15:10.101 --> 00:15:13.820
so I won't go too into depth on their origins if you're interested in that.

292
00:15:13.820 --> 00:15:15.910
I have videos on my channel already.

293
00:15:15.920 --> 00:15:19.970
I made the mistake of breaking them into like five separate videos,
but you know,

294
00:15:19.971 --> 00:15:24.740
it's the same content essentially.
So these vikings arrive out of Scandinavia to,

295
00:15:24.741 --> 00:15:26.870
as I said,
the island of Lindisfarne.

296
00:15:27.170 --> 00:15:31.280
Lindisfarne was a small island home to an Abbey of monks were living there.

297
00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:35.000
It was not a well defended area and that was actually kind of intentional.

298
00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:35.601
As I've said,

299
00:15:35.601 --> 00:15:39.410
the politics in England at this time were very turbulent and unstable.

300
00:15:39.411 --> 00:15:43.340
You had kings and kingdoms being the victims of and the propagators of these

301
00:15:43.460 --> 00:15:46.700
plots and conflicts as seemed to continue without cessation.

302
00:15:46.701 --> 00:15:50.990
So churches essentially just kind of one of the be in isolation away from all

303
00:15:50.991 --> 00:15:55.310
that.
Now the attack on Lindisfarne in which these vikings just showed up and

304
00:15:55.311 --> 00:15:58.070
essentially slaughtered or enslaved all of these defenses.

305
00:15:58.071 --> 00:16:02.150
Monks was not the first Viking raid on the British isles and not even really the

306
00:16:02.151 --> 00:16:04.460
first raid technically on England,

307
00:16:04.580 --> 00:16:08.750
but it was the first specifically recorded major incident is recorded in what

308
00:16:08.751 --> 00:16:09.561
are called the English,

309
00:16:09.561 --> 00:16:13.820
sex and chronicles and that's why it marks the beginning of the Viking age.

310
00:16:14.150 --> 00:16:17.660
For the next 60 years,
England will be plagued by viking raids.

311
00:16:17.890 --> 00:16:20.360
Now it's not as if to English.
Kings did nothing about this.

312
00:16:20.361 --> 00:16:23.480
Eventually they did wise up and prepare defenses against the vikings,

313
00:16:23.481 --> 00:16:25.010
which were effective.
In fact,

314
00:16:25.011 --> 00:16:27.830
many of Viking Raiders just kind of gave up on England and started going to

315
00:16:27.831 --> 00:16:29.480
weaker Scotland and Ireland,

316
00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:33.590
but the lack of political unity in England prevented and United response against

317
00:16:33.591 --> 00:16:36.710
the Viking raids in the beginning.
No,
I said 60 years.

318
00:16:36.711 --> 00:16:40.310
I don't mean to mislead you to think that after these cc years that things got

319
00:16:40.311 --> 00:16:44.840
better.
On the contrary,
they got worse.
The Viking say,
instead of reading England,

320
00:16:44.900 --> 00:16:46.160
let's just go and take it over,

321
00:16:46.220 --> 00:16:50.900
and so on the year eight 65 a few viking leaders actually assemble an army to go

322
00:16:50.901 --> 00:16:53.990
and do this.
It's not clear how large the army was.

323
00:16:53.991 --> 00:16:56.930
It might've been about a thousand warriors.
It might've been over a thousand.

324
00:16:56.931 --> 00:17:01.070
It might have been even less than a thousand so not a magnificently large army.

325
00:17:01.071 --> 00:17:05.600
Keep in mind there was no single Norse nation at the time to raise such an army.

326
00:17:05.750 --> 00:17:08.960
It was more like a coalition of a bunch of different viking groups coming

327
00:17:08.961 --> 00:17:13.580
together out of a mutual interest who would in all likelihood not associate much

328
00:17:13.581 --> 00:17:16.790
after England had been conquered.
It was a small army,

329
00:17:16.910 --> 00:17:20.870
but it was a considerably devastating one.
So here's England at the time.

330
00:17:21.320 --> 00:17:22.101
As you can see,

331
00:17:22.101 --> 00:17:25.550
there are fewer kingdoms here than was the case and the seventh century.

332
00:17:25.670 --> 00:17:28.340
It's mostly dominated by this time by Mercia,

333
00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:32.480
North Umbria and west ex with the Celts to the west and the north and some other

334
00:17:32.481 --> 00:17:36.740
Anglo Saxon Kingdoms in the east here and the vikings land in the territory of

335
00:17:36.741 --> 00:17:40.070
one of these smaller eastern sex and kingdoms,
east Anglia.

336
00:17:40.190 --> 00:17:42.830
The East Anglian's didn't really put up much of a fight at first.

337
00:17:42.830 --> 00:17:46.160
They sort of just surrendered and like let the Vikings pass through their land.

338
00:17:46.220 --> 00:17:48.830
In [inaudible] 66 they moved to attack north Umbria.

339
00:17:49.110 --> 00:17:52.530
They took the city of York and the North Umbria is a sanctuary surrender to and

340
00:17:52.531 --> 00:17:55.470
the vikings put a puppet king on the Northumbrian throne.

341
00:17:55.560 --> 00:17:59.580
He's saying Leah later rejects is Viking domination and stands against them of

342
00:17:59.581 --> 00:18:03.720
their crushed and our leader.
King Edmond was killed.
So by now as you can see,

343
00:18:03.721 --> 00:18:07.680
the vikings have made very significant progress into England with actually very

344
00:18:07.681 --> 00:18:10.800
little conflict.
Now they moved to invade the Kingdom of mercy,

345
00:18:10.860 --> 00:18:15.090
mercy ans put up quite a fight and they call on assistance from the Kingdom of

346
00:18:15.090 --> 00:18:15.923
Wessex to do so.

347
00:18:15.930 --> 00:18:20.460
In the year eight 70 a viking named bags like brings reinforcements called a

348
00:18:20.461 --> 00:18:24.330
great summer army with a Viking army now strength and they begin to pillage

349
00:18:24.331 --> 00:18:26.760
England and moved toward the Kingdom of Wessex,

350
00:18:26.910 --> 00:18:31.140
the King of West six at this time as a king named Ethel Red and he leads an army

351
00:18:31.141 --> 00:18:35.160
along with his younger brother Alfred only 22 at the time to take on the
vikings.

352
00:18:35.250 --> 00:18:37.170
They were at first,
not very successful,

353
00:18:37.171 --> 00:18:40.680
but eventually the image at what is remembered as the battle of Ashdown

354
00:18:40.920 --> 00:18:41.251
elsewhere.

355
00:18:41.251 --> 00:18:45.360
Red and Alfred split their forces into to the vikings began to advance across

356
00:18:45.361 --> 00:18:49.200
the field,
but Essel red insisted on praying before advancing to meet them.

357
00:18:49.350 --> 00:18:50.700
Alfred,
on the other hand,

358
00:18:50.701 --> 00:18:54.060
felt that there was no time for prayer and he charged toward the vikings with

359
00:18:54.180 --> 00:18:58.410
his half of the army and with the help of his brother who later did join him.

360
00:18:58.411 --> 00:19:01.800
He was victorious and the Vikings retreated back to the land which they had

361
00:19:01.801 --> 00:19:05.640
conquered England referred to as the Dane law shown here.

362
00:19:05.700 --> 00:19:09.480
Ethel actually dies at the same year and Alfred rises to become king.

363
00:19:09.690 --> 00:19:11.490
The Vikings though defeated at this battle.

364
00:19:11.491 --> 00:19:15.150
We're definitely not dumb and they continue to threaten Mercia in Wessex.

365
00:19:15.210 --> 00:19:16.830
Alfred at first paid them off,

366
00:19:16.831 --> 00:19:21.120
but eventually in the year eight 78 he engaged them in battle again where he was

367
00:19:21.121 --> 00:19:24.960
again victorious.
It was now that the vikings were kind of falling back,

368
00:19:24.961 --> 00:19:28.980
they withdrew from mercy of back to the Dane Law and it was clear that England

369
00:19:29.070 --> 00:19:30.510
would remain accordingly.

370
00:19:30.511 --> 00:19:34.050
Alfred gets two very important titles place to him and history.

371
00:19:34.140 --> 00:19:35.760
The first is the great.

372
00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:39.420
He's only one of two monarchs in English history to be called the great.

373
00:19:39.600 --> 00:19:43.200
The second is that he goes from being called King of the West Saxons,

374
00:19:43.230 --> 00:19:45.990
which is west six to king of the Anglo Saxons.

375
00:19:46.020 --> 00:19:50.820
This idea of Anglo Saxon unity begins to take root here and it continues on with

376
00:19:50.821 --> 00:19:54.810
his successors.
In the year nine 10 alphas son took it the even greater limits.

377
00:19:54.840 --> 00:19:59.060
He conquered the Viking shown here in East Anglia and the vikings here in Mercia

378
00:19:59.070 --> 00:20:03.060
as well and began moving northward eventually Capturing York.
Now as you can see,

379
00:20:03.061 --> 00:20:06.600
Edward had control of a considerable amount of modern England.

380
00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:10.080
He ruled over many of the formally divided Anglo Saxons and this is where we

381
00:20:10.081 --> 00:20:15.081
begin to see the title King of England feed truly accurately used Edward's son.

382
00:20:15.360 --> 00:20:19.140
Athelstan continues the expansion of this kingdom and his neighbors don't really

383
00:20:19.141 --> 00:20:20.250
like it.
In fact,

384
00:20:20.310 --> 00:20:23.700
the Scottish and Irish kingdoms of the day get kind of concerned about this

385
00:20:23.701 --> 00:20:27.910
rising English power in the unite with the Vikings temporarily and take on SLS

386
00:20:27.950 --> 00:20:32.790
and at the battle of Bruno Uber in nine 37 which the English one thus preventing

387
00:20:32.791 --> 00:20:35.970
the progress from being fractured for the moment anyway,

388
00:20:36.090 --> 00:20:40.500
and nine 78 the vikings returned under the leadership of Harold Bluetooth and

389
00:20:40.501 --> 00:20:42.880
the King of England known promptly as EFA.
Rather,

390
00:20:42.881 --> 00:20:47.350
the unready was unfit to face in order to even maintain England's existence.

391
00:20:47.351 --> 00:20:49.780
He was forced to pay tribute to them for 20 years,

392
00:20:49.781 --> 00:20:52.000
which greatly crippled the English economy.

393
00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:55.760
And the year 1001 Ethel red married the daughter of a viking king,

394
00:20:55.780 --> 00:20:56.680
the king of Norway,

395
00:20:56.681 --> 00:21:01.270
but in 1002 he foolishly or the massacre of north settlers in his territory who

396
00:21:01.271 --> 00:21:04.600
were politically more aligned with the rising nation of Denmark.

397
00:21:04.600 --> 00:21:07.600
Then just more the ambiguous term,
Norse,

398
00:21:07.690 --> 00:21:11.470
which led to another 10 year conflict with the Danish Vikings,

399
00:21:11.560 --> 00:21:13.000
Ethel red floods in Norway,

400
00:21:13.001 --> 00:21:17.200
where he subsequently died in 10 14 the same year as painful period.

401
00:21:17.260 --> 00:21:18.310
The king of the Danish.

402
00:21:18.370 --> 00:21:22.510
Now the throne of England was up in the air and Knute the of Spain defeated

403
00:21:22.511 --> 00:21:26.590
Ethel Red Sun Edmond and claim the throne for himself becoming King of England.

404
00:21:26.591 --> 00:21:29.740
Intense 16 Knute wasn't done there.
Two years later,

405
00:21:29.741 --> 00:21:33.070
he came to the throne of Denmark and in 10 28 it's sort of Norway as well.

406
00:21:33.100 --> 00:21:35.560
Thus founding the North Sea Empire,

407
00:21:35.561 --> 00:21:38.620
also known as the Anglo Scandinavian Empire.

408
00:21:39.040 --> 00:21:43.150
They'll Knute subsequently became the second and only other king in English

409
00:21:43.151 --> 00:21:44.650
history to be known as the great.

410
00:21:44.651 --> 00:21:48.450
His Empire did not last pass his death and 10 35 in fact,

411
00:21:48.451 --> 00:21:50.800
it essentially was over with his last breath.

412
00:21:50.830 --> 00:21:55.570
Knute sons did succeed him in England and his line continued until 10 42 when an

413
00:21:55.571 --> 00:21:58.210
Anglo Saxon Edward the confessor took the throne.

414
00:21:58.300 --> 00:22:02.140
Edward ruled until 10 66 were after he died without an air,

415
00:22:02.141 --> 00:22:05.380
which quite obviously was going to cost and problems to solve.

416
00:22:05.381 --> 00:22:06.790
This Harold Godwinson,

417
00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:10.300
the richest man in England and Anglo sex and to whom he likely did,

418
00:22:10.301 --> 00:22:12.490
actually the throne succeeded him.
In fact,

419
00:22:12.491 --> 00:22:15.100
he hastily Kieron himself the day of Edwards funeral.

420
00:22:15.160 --> 00:22:18.820
Regardless though Godwinson his reign was doomed from the start and many people

421
00:22:18.821 --> 00:22:19.870
of the day believed it,

422
00:22:20.050 --> 00:22:23.290
especially as Holly's comments had passed by England's during this time,

423
00:22:23.291 --> 00:22:26.140
which was seen as an obvious omen.
That same year,

424
00:22:26.141 --> 00:22:29.530
England was invaded by Harold Hardrada,
King of Norway,

425
00:22:29.620 --> 00:22:32.410
who had the intention of restoring the North Sea Empire.

426
00:22:33.310 --> 00:22:37.300
The Viking forces met the Anglo Saxons at the battle of Stamford Bridge where

427
00:22:37.301 --> 00:22:40.960
they were brutally defeated in her drawer was killed by an arrow.

428
00:22:41.200 --> 00:22:42.940
The better of the two Harolds had.

429
00:22:42.941 --> 00:22:47.260
One is death and the failure of the Vikings Conquest and marks the end of the

430
00:22:47.261 --> 00:22:48.130
Viking age.

431
00:22:48.160 --> 00:22:51.850
The Vikings did not have an insignificant impact on England to though in fact

432
00:22:51.851 --> 00:22:54.250
their influence affected English history permanently.

433
00:22:54.410 --> 00:22:56.800
They contributed significantly to the English language.

434
00:22:56.801 --> 00:22:59.380
They set up a number of settlements in the British isles,

435
00:22:59.381 --> 00:23:02.350
including the city of Dublin,
which would become the capital of Ireland.

436
00:23:02.380 --> 00:23:05.470
Their culture in general presence shaped English,
sex in England.

437
00:23:05.471 --> 00:23:09.190
It's a nation that it would become and they even laid the seeds for England's

438
00:23:09.191 --> 00:23:11.170
next invader,
the Normans.

439
00:23:11.710 --> 00:23:15.520
It was not even a month after Harold Godwinson his victory over the vikings,

440
00:23:15.530 --> 00:23:20.140
that intense 66 William the conqueror,
the Duke of Normandy,
invaded England.

441
00:23:20.260 --> 00:23:22.030
In fact,
it was only three days later.

442
00:23:22.150 --> 00:23:25.900
Part of the justification for this was that William actually had a claim to the

443
00:23:25.901 --> 00:23:29.890
English throne and he was related to Harold's predecessor,
Edward and William,

444
00:23:29.920 --> 00:23:33.850
and in fact,
much of Europe believed that the throne ought to have gone to him.

445
00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:36.970
William was very confident in his ability to conquer England.

446
00:23:37.210 --> 00:23:41.110
Tales were later told that his mother had a dream of great tree extending over

447
00:23:41.111 --> 00:23:43.480
Normandy in England the night that he was conceived.

448
00:23:43.540 --> 00:23:46.310
Now here is normally today a part of France,

449
00:23:46.311 --> 00:23:50.000
but it's important to remember Normandy was culturally and linguistically in

450
00:23:50.001 --> 00:23:52.940
such very similar to France,
but the Normans themselves,

451
00:23:52.941 --> 00:23:55.260
including William or in French Guiana.

452
00:23:55.310 --> 00:23:59.690
We're the descendants of vikings who had carved out that territory about 150

453
00:23:59.691 --> 00:24:04.110
years early in simply integrated themselves into French society.
In fact,

454
00:24:04.111 --> 00:24:07.790
the name normity is related to Northmen,
I.
E.
The Vikings.

455
00:24:08.240 --> 00:24:12.020
So William Invades England with around 10,000 or so men,

456
00:24:12.050 --> 00:24:14.510
and within a few weeks he meets Harold Godwinson,

457
00:24:14.511 --> 00:24:18.350
who commanded maybe around 8,000 men.
At the battle of Hastings,

458
00:24:18.440 --> 00:24:21.290
Harold and William were extremely eager to meet each other.
In fact,

459
00:24:21.380 --> 00:24:25.550
reports tell that William actually put his armor on backwards at first rush to

460
00:24:25.551 --> 00:24:26.060
meet him.

461
00:24:26.060 --> 00:24:30.170
The battle lasted for most of the day and the Normans outgunned with having more

462
00:24:30.171 --> 00:24:33.200
archers and calvary and likely outnumbered the Anglo Saxons.

463
00:24:33.290 --> 00:24:35.240
The Anglo Saxons were defeated at this battle.

464
00:24:35.270 --> 00:24:38.420
Godwinson was like they killed toward the end of it and soon thereafter,

465
00:24:38.421 --> 00:24:40.730
hope of victory against the Normans was lost.

466
00:24:40.790 --> 00:24:44.630
William the conqueror now ruled one of the most powerful and stable kingdoms in

467
00:24:44.631 --> 00:24:45.620
Europe of the day.

468
00:24:45.770 --> 00:24:49.400
Hastings went down as one of the most significant battles in English history.

469
00:24:49.640 --> 00:24:53.870
Major changes fall.
This battle never again would an Anglo Saxon rural England,

470
00:24:53.960 --> 00:24:58.550
the Anglo Saxon aristocracy to had largely been dispossessed and replaced with

471
00:24:58.551 --> 00:25:02.840
Norman Aristocrats and will sax in English was now the language of the
peasantry.

472
00:25:02.841 --> 00:25:06.830
The ruling elites spoke Norman French and would actually continue to for some

473
00:25:06.831 --> 00:25:10.910
time,
but Norman,
French and English would not remain separate.
They would merge.

474
00:25:10.940 --> 00:25:11.391
In fact,

475
00:25:11.391 --> 00:25:15.170
modern English has a heavier influence from Norman French than the Anglo Saxon.

476
00:25:15.170 --> 00:25:17.300
Old English giving us a plethora of words.

477
00:25:17.420 --> 00:25:21.760
Many English sacks and nobles simply left a country and move to Scandinavia or

478
00:25:21.770 --> 00:25:24.200
Scotland or Ireland,
including some of Harold Godwinson,

479
00:25:24.201 --> 00:25:25.730
his family who moved to Ireland.

480
00:25:25.910 --> 00:25:29.840
The Normans moved into capitulate the Anglo Saxons by asserting their dominance.

481
00:25:29.900 --> 00:25:32.540
They built churches and castles,
including London Tower.

482
00:25:32.720 --> 00:25:36.170
They documented the entire country of revealing to us great detail about the

483
00:25:36.171 --> 00:25:38.810
societal structure of England.
A thousand years ago.

484
00:25:38.870 --> 00:25:41.900
They gradually eliminated slavery in even at the time reporting,

485
00:25:41.901 --> 00:25:46.901
perhaps 10% of the population was formerly enslaved but rebellion Brood and the

486
00:25:47.181 --> 00:25:49.420
North William face in English,
sex and rebellion,

487
00:25:49.430 --> 00:25:52.910
which was assisted by the Danish,
which he brutally suppressed.

488
00:25:53.120 --> 00:25:55.310
The Normans would face other rebellions too as well.

489
00:25:55.311 --> 00:25:59.030
It's an invasion from France,
but their hold over England will remain firm.

490
00:25:59.210 --> 00:26:03.800
William died the 9th of September in the year 10 87 his successors when they

491
00:26:03.801 --> 00:26:05.810
weren't busy trying to hold onto their reign,

492
00:26:05.870 --> 00:26:09.650
we continue to rule England and eventually moved into Scotland and invaded Wales

493
00:26:09.651 --> 00:26:14.000
and Ireland.
William successors were not quite as successful as he was,

494
00:26:14.001 --> 00:26:16.720
so civil war broke out over successions.

495
00:26:16.730 --> 00:26:20.540
The monarchy would become considerably unstable and following two invasions from

496
00:26:20.541 --> 00:26:24.860
Scotland,
England enters into a period call to the NR where in King Henry,

497
00:26:24.861 --> 00:26:25.850
the first nephew,

498
00:26:25.910 --> 00:26:29.360
Stephan and his daughter fought for control just certain large because Henry de

499
00:26:29.390 --> 00:26:32.060
first son had unfortunately died unexpectedly.

500
00:26:32.360 --> 00:26:36.410
This period which lasted 17 years is remembered for it's savage violence and

501
00:26:36.411 --> 00:26:37.130
bloodshed.

502
00:26:37.130 --> 00:26:40.690
Henry's daughter had divorced the holy Roman emperor and had married Jeffery to

503
00:26:40.691 --> 00:26:41.600
count of volunteers you,

504
00:26:41.720 --> 00:26:46.720
which becomes a very detail in 10 33 she has a son with account whom she named

505
00:26:47.040 --> 00:26:50.490
Henry.
Henry was destined to succeed his father,
but as his mother,

506
00:26:50.520 --> 00:26:54.600
Matilda had great hopes that he would one day become king of England as well.

507
00:26:54.660 --> 00:26:58.140
After a considerable amount of conflict with both sides coming close to victory

508
00:26:58.141 --> 00:27:00.660
and then an ability switching sides accordingly each time.

509
00:27:01.230 --> 00:27:05.010
The civil war eventually ends in 1152 was Steven becoming king.

510
00:27:05.160 --> 00:27:09.330
His rule was uneasy as if that wasn't obvious following almost 20 years of civil

511
00:27:09.331 --> 00:27:12.510
war,
but his succession was also unclear.
And furthermore,

512
00:27:12.511 --> 00:27:16.290
his reign included England.
Losing lands is Scottish and wash invaders.

513
00:27:16.470 --> 00:27:17.510
Despite these troubles,

514
00:27:17.511 --> 00:27:22.470
Steven reigned until his death and 1154 two years after the NRK officially ends.

515
00:27:22.620 --> 00:27:23.311
By this time,

516
00:27:23.311 --> 00:27:27.450
Henry Matilda's son was now the ruler of all you and much of western France,

517
00:27:27.451 --> 00:27:29.460
and he had married Eleanor of Aquitaine.

518
00:27:29.580 --> 00:27:31.880
Unfortunately for Steve and his son used this,

519
00:27:31.881 --> 00:27:35.850
a died earlier in the year 1153 leaving him without a successor.

520
00:27:36.240 --> 00:27:40.710
He reached an agreement with Henry and Henry would succeed him and there would

521
00:27:40.711 --> 00:27:43.380
be peace in England regarding the succession.

522
00:27:43.410 --> 00:27:47.250
Henry was coronated on the 25th of October becoming Henry the second and

523
00:27:47.251 --> 00:27:50.730
founding the Plantagenet dynasty,
which would rule over the college event,

524
00:27:50.731 --> 00:27:52.250
empire encompassing lands,

525
00:27:52.251 --> 00:27:55.740
what would stretch from northern England to the pier knees.
So once again,

526
00:27:55.770 --> 00:27:58.950
England had more French speaking rule us from friends.
In fact,

527
00:27:58.951 --> 00:28:02.760
Henry only ever spoke very poor English,
French and Latin.
We're all that.

528
00:28:02.761 --> 00:28:04.980
The ruler of England of the day needed Henry.

529
00:28:04.981 --> 00:28:09.180
The second was known for his great temper.
He was power hungry,
ambitious,

530
00:28:09.181 --> 00:28:11.610
energetic and impulsive.
To his benefit.

531
00:28:11.611 --> 00:28:15.270
He used these traces of cure power from the barons back to the monarchy and

532
00:28:15.271 --> 00:28:19.260
allowed him to expand his empire in the Scotland,
Wales,
Brittany in Ireland.

533
00:28:19.620 --> 00:28:21.060
But to his degradation,

534
00:28:21.300 --> 00:28:24.630
he would cause much of his own family to turn on him and he would have a number

535
00:28:24.631 --> 00:28:27.420
of shocking incidents such as a death of Thomas Beckett,

536
00:28:27.570 --> 00:28:31.440
the Archbishop of Canterbury Baguette get in the king had been feuding for years

537
00:28:31.441 --> 00:28:33.210
and following a transgression.

538
00:28:33.240 --> 00:28:37.050
It's recorded that the king said in front of his men something along the lines

539
00:28:37.051 --> 00:28:40.770
of what miserable drones and traders have a nourished and Brock and my household

540
00:28:40.771 --> 00:28:44.070
to have let their Lord be treated with such shameful contempt by a low born

541
00:28:44.071 --> 00:28:47.160
cleric.
Henry's nights over hearing these words,

542
00:28:47.161 --> 00:28:50.970
took them literally and the assassinated Beckett's soon after an event,

543
00:28:50.971 --> 00:28:53.730
which would ruin Henry's image across Europe.
Now,

544
00:28:53.731 --> 00:28:58.170
obviously Henry had no intention of actually killing the Archbishop of

545
00:28:58.170 --> 00:29:00.060
Canterbury,
but he could not control his anger and his men.

546
00:29:00.061 --> 00:29:04.140
Miss took him 1189 Henry would be succeeded by his third son,
Richard.

547
00:29:04.141 --> 00:29:08.430
The first it becomes B set of Richard that he possessed a cool dileo or the

548
00:29:08.431 --> 00:29:11.370
heart of a lion because of his grace access and battle.

549
00:29:11.460 --> 00:29:15.030
Most notably during the third crusade where he fought against a lot hadeen the

550
00:29:15.031 --> 00:29:16.770
Saltin of Egypt and Syria,

551
00:29:16.920 --> 00:29:21.150
but also of course in defending his father from rebellion in his youth and also

552
00:29:21.151 --> 00:29:23.790
in the battlefields of France defending his territory is there,

553
00:29:23.850 --> 00:29:25.320
despite being king of England,

554
00:29:25.321 --> 00:29:28.110
rich would spend perhaps as little as six months of his reign.

555
00:29:28.111 --> 00:29:29.490
Actually in England.
In fact,

556
00:29:29.491 --> 00:29:31.740
he didn't have a whole lot of interest in England itself.

557
00:29:32.070 --> 00:29:36.510
He preferred to see it as a territory which supported his much larger European

558
00:29:36.511 --> 00:29:41.410
empire.
Richard would die in 1199 from an error wound which became infected.

559
00:29:41.411 --> 00:29:44.740
What?
Fighting in France.
He was succeeded by his younger brother,
John,

560
00:29:44.741 --> 00:29:47.260
who was less of a popular the ruler.
In fact,

561
00:29:47.261 --> 00:29:50.530
he isn't remembered as a very good ruler at all in English history.

562
00:29:51.160 --> 00:29:53.260
He first rebelled against his father,
Henry,

563
00:29:53.261 --> 00:29:56.560
while he was still king and then later against his brother Richard,

564
00:29:56.561 --> 00:29:59.110
while he was king.
Failing.
Of course,
false times.

565
00:29:59.170 --> 00:30:03.010
John was deeply concerned about being the youngest son of the royal family,

566
00:30:03.011 --> 00:30:05.800
but when placed in positions of power such as an Ireland,

567
00:30:05.801 --> 00:30:09.820
he displayed greed and power hungriness.
Despite this,
he still became king.

568
00:30:09.910 --> 00:30:13.840
It's during John's reign that a tale of Robin Hood is a place,
you know,

569
00:30:13.900 --> 00:30:16.780
like government so bad that a thief is actually praised.

570
00:30:16.870 --> 00:30:18.970
John committed quite a few mistakes during his reign.

571
00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:21.000
He fought multiple losing wars in effect,

572
00:30:21.001 --> 00:30:24.790
Lost Normandy to France and the Contravent empire really began to collapse with

573
00:30:24.791 --> 00:30:26.260
John.
According lead John,

574
00:30:26.261 --> 00:30:29.410
we'll place heavy taxes on the lower class is to pay for these wars and would

575
00:30:29.411 --> 00:30:32.500
seize land from an ability in the church to augment his power.

576
00:30:32.560 --> 00:30:35.980
He would even go so far as to rape the daughters of his noble subjects and

577
00:30:35.981 --> 00:30:39.310
personally murder a contender to to throw in while he had him in prison.

578
00:30:39.460 --> 00:30:43.240
The nobles aside that they can't just sit by and let this happen in the church

579
00:30:43.241 --> 00:30:44.410
was pretty unhappy too.

580
00:30:44.411 --> 00:30:48.490
So eventually a band of these Nobel supported by the church gathers and army and

581
00:30:48.491 --> 00:30:52.540
rebels against the king and they march on London and the Archbishop of

582
00:30:52.540 --> 00:30:57.130
Canterbury drafts a treaty or a new rule book that was settled to dispute the

583
00:30:57.130 --> 00:31:00.820
Magna Carta and English,
the Great Charter.
It contains 63 new laws,

584
00:31:00.821 --> 00:31:04.480
which the king was obligated to follow up with regard to the church and the

585
00:31:04.481 --> 00:31:09.160
treatment of his barons.
Not with so much focus on the common people just yet,

586
00:31:09.161 --> 00:31:12.970
but it was a start towards limiting the power of the government.

587
00:31:13.030 --> 00:31:18.030
King John signed it on the 15th of June 12th 15 now John was essentially forced

588
00:31:18.341 --> 00:31:18.791
to sign it.

589
00:31:18.791 --> 00:31:22.390
He had no intention of actually following through with it and he really didn't.

590
00:31:22.570 --> 00:31:26.140
The pope a node it and in fact civil war would eventually break out between John

591
00:31:26.141 --> 00:31:29.470
and the barons and John Wick continued to nine of legitimacy of it until his

592
00:31:29.471 --> 00:31:33.760
death in 1217 even though the principles laid out by the Magna Carta had a rough

593
00:31:33.761 --> 00:31:34.181
start,

594
00:31:34.181 --> 00:31:38.110
it remains a significant document as being the first time in English history.

595
00:31:38.111 --> 00:31:40.210
That's certain ideals were proposed.

596
00:31:40.360 --> 00:31:44.380
It puts forth the idea of rule of law that the decisions of a nation should be

597
00:31:44.381 --> 00:31:48.730
made with great focus on the benefit of the nation,
not as much the ruling elite.

598
00:31:48.790 --> 00:31:52.840
It proposes that the king may be above the laws of men,
but not the laws of God.

599
00:31:53.050 --> 00:31:56.410
The king cannot be murderous and tyrannical without being reprimanded.

600
00:31:56.470 --> 00:31:59.940
It created a system where many of the kings decisions has it be cross checked

601
00:31:59.941 --> 00:32:03.940
with a noble as of England as system which would lead to the modern parliament.

602
00:32:04.120 --> 00:32:08.020
Quite obviously,
many of these principles are central to England to this day,

603
00:32:08.080 --> 00:32:09.610
John Son Henry the third,

604
00:32:09.611 --> 00:32:12.990
we also fight over the legitimacy of the Magna Carta and we would actually call

605
00:32:13.010 --> 00:32:14.980
together the first equivalent of a parliament.

606
00:32:15.220 --> 00:32:17.350
Henry would be succeeded by his son Edward,

607
00:32:17.351 --> 00:32:21.040
the first along shanks or long lake cause he was a considerably tall and

608
00:32:21.041 --> 00:32:22.270
intimidating individual.

609
00:32:22.300 --> 00:32:25.740
And 1272 this is the king from the famous movie Braveheart,

610
00:32:25.780 --> 00:32:28.840
and I won't go incredibly into detail about that in this video because I've

611
00:32:28.841 --> 00:32:31.450
already done a video on the true story of that already.

612
00:32:31.690 --> 00:32:35.680
But Edward did indeed invade Scotland during his reign earning him the nickname,

613
00:32:35.681 --> 00:32:38.710
the hammer up to Scott's.
But he did more than that too.
As prince,

614
00:32:38.711 --> 00:32:40.900
he took part in the ninth crusade.
I'm gonna fight him,

615
00:32:41.030 --> 00:32:43.970
fight in the conflicts surrounding the Magna Carta and such.

616
00:32:43.971 --> 00:32:48.080
At a time on his coronation at Westminster Abbey,
which was built by his father,

617
00:32:48.110 --> 00:32:51.080
Edward was crowned and he declared that he would only a door in the crown once

618
00:32:51.081 --> 00:32:54.350
again,
when all the lands lost by his father,
we're his,

619
00:32:54.500 --> 00:32:57.260
he was intent on dominating the British isles as king.

620
00:32:57.261 --> 00:32:58.730
He put down rebellions in Wales,

621
00:32:58.731 --> 00:33:02.360
reformed English law and reaffirm the power of the monarchy while at the same

622
00:33:02.361 --> 00:33:05.750
time sending a parliaments permanents parliament gave him a route to taxes.

623
00:33:05.751 --> 00:33:09.320
Subjects provide funding for his various war is on and off the British isles,

624
00:33:09.321 --> 00:33:13.250
but problems regarding the power of the monarchy was with great regard to this

625
00:33:13.251 --> 00:33:15.110
would continue even after his rule.

626
00:33:15.560 --> 00:33:18.380
He ordered the expulsion of the Jews from the country of ban,

627
00:33:18.381 --> 00:33:20.570
which lasted until the 17th century.

628
00:33:20.840 --> 00:33:23.990
Edward would have a very prolonged and costly war in Scotland dealing with

629
00:33:23.991 --> 00:33:25.430
figures such as William Wallace,

630
00:33:25.431 --> 00:33:27.950
but a number of other Scottish nobe wasn't leaders as well.

631
00:33:28.040 --> 00:33:31.880
Even though prior to this period,
Scotland,
England lived in relative peace.

632
00:33:32.240 --> 00:33:35.320
During this war though,
Edward procured the stone of Schoon,

633
00:33:35.600 --> 00:33:39.620
the stone on which all Scottish king has had thus far been coronate and he took

634
00:33:39.621 --> 00:33:42.980
it to England.
Who owns it to the state,
though it is now captain Scotland,

635
00:33:43.040 --> 00:33:46.640
though he maintained his kingdom with a strong hand is weaker son Edward.

636
00:33:46.641 --> 00:33:49.340
The second lacked his strength.
His son Edward,

637
00:33:49.341 --> 00:33:51.650
who is only one of the 15 children that he had,

638
00:33:51.651 --> 00:33:53.990
would ultimately lose the lands that his father had,

639
00:33:53.991 --> 00:33:57.650
one in Scotland to Robert the Bruce and would be a generally weak leader.

640
00:33:57.710 --> 00:34:01.370
He was a very obvious homosexual which angered the barons of this day and likely

641
00:34:01.371 --> 00:34:05.300
contributed to his great difficulties with his wife who would betray him with

642
00:34:05.330 --> 00:34:08.330
Roger Mortimer of Wales.
He neglected his cane lead duties.

643
00:34:08.331 --> 00:34:12.350
He had the unfortunate coincidence of being a king during bad weather,
I.
E.

644
00:34:12.351 --> 00:34:16.640
A two year fem in which killed off 10% of being less population and he was just

645
00:34:16.641 --> 00:34:21.641
eventually to posed in 1327 Mortimer and his wife Isabella ruled until Edward,

646
00:34:22.191 --> 00:34:26.120
the second son Edward killed Mortimer and imprisons,
his mother becoming Edward.

647
00:34:26.121 --> 00:34:29.980
The third Edward the third's early rain consisted of war with Scotland and what?

648
00:34:29.981 --> 00:34:33.140
She had a decent amount of success but eventually agreed to a truce with the

649
00:34:33.141 --> 00:34:35.210
Scottish part of the reason for the war,

650
00:34:35.211 --> 00:34:39.380
which Edward the third found himself in with the Scottish was a looming threat

651
00:34:39.410 --> 00:34:43.460
which England was right in the middle of an alliance between Scotland and
France,

652
00:34:43.461 --> 00:34:47.630
perhaps middle medieval England's two greatest enemies with fears of a full on

653
00:34:47.631 --> 00:34:51.680
invasion of England from France and with France interfering with English trade

654
00:34:51.681 --> 00:34:53.090
and what the rest of the continent.

655
00:34:53.090 --> 00:34:56.330
Edward knew that he would have to take action against France and you'd have to

656
00:34:56.331 --> 00:35:00.380
do it soon.
To counter the Franco Scottish alliance known as the alt alliance,

657
00:35:00.410 --> 00:35:04.310
Edward would ally himself with other European nations notably with Portugal in

658
00:35:04.320 --> 00:35:07.610
the alliance with Portugal and as a matter of fact would endear as one of the

659
00:35:07.611 --> 00:35:10.010
longest lasting alliances and world history.

660
00:35:10.070 --> 00:35:14.480
That's not all though as the king of France will leap to six took the Duchy of

661
00:35:14.480 --> 00:35:14.481
Aquitaine.

662
00:35:14.481 --> 00:35:18.380
Edward would not solely just resist this invasion on his former territory.

663
00:35:18.381 --> 00:35:21.830
He would be so bold as to claim the throne of France for himself.

664
00:35:22.070 --> 00:35:24.740
Edward was in fact related to the French monarchy.

665
00:35:24.830 --> 00:35:26.390
Phillipe to sixth was his uncle,

666
00:35:26.391 --> 00:35:30.020
but he did not have that much of a legitimate claim to the French throne.

667
00:35:30.200 --> 00:35:33.830
Edward was technically the closest living relative to trials,
the fourth,

668
00:35:33.831 --> 00:35:36.410
the last king from the house of the Copay,
but Charles,

669
00:35:36.411 --> 00:35:39.870
his instructions for the nobility to choose the next thing in France and they

670
00:35:39.871 --> 00:35:43.920
chose Phillipe 60 marking the beginning of the house of Valois and French.

671
00:35:43.920 --> 00:35:48.300
Notably Edwards actions were very obviously a response more to the political

672
00:35:48.301 --> 00:35:50.820
situation of the day,
but Edward would still,

673
00:35:50.821 --> 00:35:55.821
regardless press is rights as king and would indeed invade France.

674
00:35:55.921 --> 00:36:00.130
Even changing his royal standard to include both lions of England and the flare

675
00:36:00.131 --> 00:36:02.430
to leaves of France as shown here,

676
00:36:02.610 --> 00:36:06.540
the war for the throne of France would not be an insignificant one.
In fact,

677
00:36:06.541 --> 00:36:11.220
it would last for over a hundred years and thus historians have creatively named

678
00:36:11.221 --> 00:36:12.810
it the hundred years war.

679
00:36:12.900 --> 00:36:15.810
Two important points regarding the name Hundred Years War though.

680
00:36:15.960 --> 00:36:20.220
The first is that it wasn't a hundred years exactly.
It was 116 years.

681
00:36:20.640 --> 00:36:23.910
The second it wasn't just one long endless war.

682
00:36:23.911 --> 00:36:26.780
It was more like four wars with a series of side wars,

683
00:36:26.790 --> 00:36:29.890
I suppose you could say involved in this 116 years dispute.

684
00:36:30.060 --> 00:36:32.280
The four main wars where the Edwardian war,

685
00:36:32.281 --> 00:36:37.281
1337 to 1360 the Caroline worth or a teen 69 to 1389 the Len Castro and war 1415

686
00:36:40.081 --> 00:36:45.081
to 1420 and the second Lancastrian war 1422 1453 in 1340 Edward and his son

687
00:36:47.071 --> 00:36:49.320
Edward,
who would be known as the black prince,

688
00:36:49.321 --> 00:36:52.050
invade France to not only defend the English possessions,

689
00:36:52.170 --> 00:36:54.060
possessions that England had in France,

690
00:36:54.061 --> 00:36:57.930
but of course to claim the crown of France with England visiting France.

691
00:36:57.930 --> 00:37:01.200
Scotland moved in and retook much of their former territory,

692
00:37:01.201 --> 00:37:05.070
but their success in war against England during this war would not last forever.

693
00:37:05.190 --> 00:37:10.190
The English and the French met at the bowel of Cressey on August 26 1346 the

694
00:37:10.411 --> 00:37:13.270
battle of Cressey,
it was a disaster for the French forces,

695
00:37:13.290 --> 00:37:17.010
the English with Louis,
perhaps around 200 men,
the French with Louis,

696
00:37:17.011 --> 00:37:21.330
perhaps 6,000 obviously with this defeat,
the French king was outraged,

697
00:37:21.331 --> 00:37:23.640
but how did this catastrophic defeat happened?

698
00:37:24.210 --> 00:37:28.830
Edward was fighting war differently for much of the European warfare leading up

699
00:37:28.831 --> 00:37:30.150
to this valve for hundreds of years.

700
00:37:30.151 --> 00:37:34.080
The horseman was the master of the battlefield against Archer and infantry men.

701
00:37:34.081 --> 00:37:38.340
They were difficult to defeat Edward prepared for this though he had his men dig

702
00:37:38.341 --> 00:37:40.740
holes in the ground which would cause a horse of the trip.

703
00:37:40.741 --> 00:37:44.310
He would put up stakes to deter or kill anymore horsemen and crucially he

704
00:37:44.311 --> 00:37:47.160
employed the English Longbow.
The English Longbow,

705
00:37:47.161 --> 00:37:48.990
which was likely first invented in Wales,

706
00:37:48.991 --> 00:37:51.810
had a greater strength range and speed and the crossbows,

707
00:37:51.811 --> 00:37:54.270
which the French and their Genevieve's mercenaries were using.

708
00:37:54.420 --> 00:37:58.190
They were in truth a deciding factor of this battle leading to a brutal French

709
00:37:58.191 --> 00:38:00.600
to even though they outnumbered English forces.

710
00:38:00.810 --> 00:38:04.710
Edward was also not fighting a stereotypical war either rather than having a

711
00:38:04.711 --> 00:38:08.250
series of battles as had been in a case in warfare leading up to this point,

712
00:38:08.251 --> 00:38:11.130
again,
he preferred to simply skirmish the French relentlessly.

713
00:38:11.550 --> 00:38:15.060
Not long after this battle,
the black death ravage as much of Europe,

714
00:38:15.061 --> 00:38:16.650
including England and France.

715
00:38:16.800 --> 00:38:21.000
The you're seeing a pestis bacteria traveling across Europe from Central Asia

716
00:38:21.060 --> 00:38:25.080
through hitching a ride on pests would kill a victim with an a matter of days.

717
00:38:25.200 --> 00:38:30.200
It began in 1348 and lasted until 1349 but it claimed the lives of 6 million

718
00:38:30.781 --> 00:38:33.900
English alone,
half of the population at the time,

719
00:38:33.990 --> 00:38:36.640
France to lost perhaps half of its population.

720
00:38:36.760 --> 00:38:40.750
It would return in the 1360 he's again killing millions regardless of the

721
00:38:40.751 --> 00:38:42.790
circumstances of the war,
would continue.

722
00:38:42.880 --> 00:38:47.350
Phillipe to six died in 1350 and was succeeded by his son John the second on

723
00:38:47.351 --> 00:38:49.000
September,

724
00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:53.080
1913 56 the English and French would meet at the battle of Poitier where again

725
00:38:53.081 --> 00:38:55.210
the French would suffer a devastating defeat.

726
00:38:55.300 --> 00:38:58.570
Not only will they lose thousands to again minimal English losses,

727
00:38:58.571 --> 00:39:02.950
but their king was captured and was later ransom in 1360 the English and French

728
00:39:02.951 --> 00:39:04.630
sign the Treaty of Breton,
neat,

729
00:39:04.631 --> 00:39:07.840
which heavily favor the English allowing them to keep all the land which they

730
00:39:07.841 --> 00:39:11.680
had one and on the French side we'll at least at end of the conflict.

731
00:39:11.740 --> 00:39:15.640
This piece would only last nine years though and the hundred years war would

732
00:39:15.641 --> 00:39:19.330
start once again and even during this peace conflict and Brittany,

733
00:39:19.360 --> 00:39:21.640
which involved both England and France would be occurring.

734
00:39:21.790 --> 00:39:24.910
I mentioned some new developments and how this war was being fought that were

735
00:39:24.911 --> 00:39:27.830
very innovative and revolutionary for the time,
but longbows,

736
00:39:27.840 --> 00:39:29.200
we're not the only innovation.

737
00:39:29.440 --> 00:39:33.190
Artillery had a significant role in this war and gunpowder was making its debut,

738
00:39:33.230 --> 00:39:36.520
albeit awkwardly.
Beyond that though,
societies were changing,

739
00:39:36.610 --> 00:39:40.270
even though this was a war concerning the power of monarchs and ability,

740
00:39:40.271 --> 00:39:43.450
nationalistic tendencies were evolving in France and England.

741
00:39:43.540 --> 00:39:47.650
People felt a sense of duty not only to their king,
but also to their nation.

742
00:39:47.830 --> 00:39:51.490
This attitude was quite certainly influenced by the introduction of standing

743
00:39:51.491 --> 00:39:52.780
armies.
Prior to this,

744
00:39:52.781 --> 00:39:56.260
armies would be raised by the king and noblemen temporarily for his,

745
00:39:56.270 --> 00:39:58.420
but because of the longevity of this conflict,

746
00:39:58.480 --> 00:40:02.120
the English and French felt unnecessary to have a more permanent and discipline

747
00:40:02.130 --> 00:40:05.170
fighting force and the monarchs of these nations revise things like their

748
00:40:05.171 --> 00:40:07.060
taxation methods to support this.

749
00:40:07.390 --> 00:40:10.960
In 1369 the war was back on propagated by the French.

750
00:40:10.961 --> 00:40:15.040
This time on their Charles the fifth hence,
it became known as the Caroline wore.

751
00:40:15.370 --> 00:40:17.770
The pope pleaded with the compounds to find peace,

752
00:40:17.771 --> 00:40:21.700
but the church was preoccupied and was unable to truly convinced it to to cease

753
00:40:21.701 --> 00:40:23.920
hostilities.
Edward's son Edward,

754
00:40:23.921 --> 00:40:28.921
the black prince would die in 1376 and Edward a third in 1377 Edward the third

755
00:40:29.561 --> 00:40:33.010
would therefore be succeeded by his grandson who became Richard the second and

756
00:40:33.011 --> 00:40:36.520
1377 Richard was only 10 years old at a time,
however,

757
00:40:36.521 --> 00:40:38.770
and therefore regency under John of gaunt,

758
00:40:38.870 --> 00:40:43.540
Richard's uncle wasn't stated in 1381 following the stresses of the black death

759
00:40:43.541 --> 00:40:45.580
and the stresses of the taxes he used to pay for the war.

760
00:40:45.581 --> 00:40:48.880
The English peasantry revolted led by Walt Tyler of Kent.

761
00:40:49.030 --> 00:40:53.050
The revolt itself was not very successful and was over within half a year,

762
00:40:53.051 --> 00:40:56.950
but it showed the socio economic strain on England during this age.

763
00:40:56.980 --> 00:40:57.940
Three years later,

764
00:40:57.941 --> 00:41:02.320
and the 1384 war with Scotland began again and a king was forced to raise taxes

765
00:41:02.321 --> 00:41:05.380
making,
making king Richard even more unpopular.
Meanwhile,

766
00:41:05.381 --> 00:41:08.710
the French carved back into many other territories which have been lost in the

767
00:41:08.711 --> 00:41:12.040
first phase of the Hundred Years War.
Bringing the English to accept the truce.

768
00:41:12.050 --> 00:41:16.270
In 1389 the French had won the second phase of the war and peace would continue

769
00:41:16.271 --> 00:41:21.271
until 1415 Richard the second was dethroned in 1399 and replaced with John of

770
00:41:21.520 --> 00:41:23.350
God's son,
Henry the fourth Henry.

771
00:41:23.351 --> 00:41:26.560
The fourth was interestingly the first king since Harold Godwinson,

772
00:41:26.561 --> 00:41:29.830
whose mother tongue was English,
not French,
and very significantly,

773
00:41:29.920 --> 00:41:33.920
he was the first king of the Lancastrian branch of the house of Plant Agilent.

774
00:41:34.010 --> 00:41:37.370
He would rule until 1413 when he was succeeded by his son,

775
00:41:37.371 --> 00:41:40.490
Henry the fifth who would play a major role in the hundred years war.

776
00:41:40.550 --> 00:41:44.270
He too would assert his claim over this French thrown and after making alliance

777
00:41:44.271 --> 00:41:49.160
with the Burgundians in 1415 Henry would invade Normandy and very unfortunately

778
00:41:49.161 --> 00:41:52.670
for the French,
they're King Charles's six was insane.

779
00:41:52.850 --> 00:41:56.390
He was essentially unable to rule and this caused a great divide between the

780
00:41:56.391 --> 00:41:59.720
French nobility about his succession leading to a bit of civil war.

781
00:41:59.721 --> 00:42:03.650
And this is a very crucial time.
On October the 25th of that same year,

782
00:42:03.651 --> 00:42:08.120
the battle of Agincourt took place and this was a third grade French military

783
00:42:08.121 --> 00:42:12.740
disaster,
English tactics and technology succeeded again and the English loss,

784
00:42:12.741 --> 00:42:17.741
perhaps 600 men while the French laws very likely over 8,000 Henry presses into

785
00:42:18.261 --> 00:42:21.890
France and in fact finally in a sense secures the French throne.

786
00:42:22.040 --> 00:42:26.210
Henry is declared to be following the treaty of Troy as the air of Charles is

787
00:42:26.211 --> 00:42:28.970
six the king of France.
To secure this further,

788
00:42:28.971 --> 00:42:33.200
he marries the king's daughter Catherine,
but then something unexpected happens.

789
00:42:33.201 --> 00:42:37.820
Henry dies young from dysentery and 1422 only two months before Charles is six

790
00:42:37.821 --> 00:42:40.820
days now Henry's air was his son also named Henry,

791
00:42:40.821 --> 00:42:43.640
but the French did not recognize the young Henry as the air.

792
00:42:43.640 --> 00:42:46.570
They instead named their king's son Charles,
who would be Charles,

793
00:42:46.571 --> 00:42:49.910
his seventh king.
And so of course war continues.

794
00:42:50.240 --> 00:42:53.150
It would've been very interesting to have seen what would have happened if Henry

795
00:42:53.151 --> 00:42:56.720
the fifth had not died young and would have gone on to become king of France.

796
00:42:56.721 --> 00:42:59.570
But of course,
that's not what happened with war.

797
00:42:59.571 --> 00:43:04.460
Back on though a new hero or rather heroin would rise to the scene this time on

798
00:43:04.461 --> 00:43:05.690
the side of the French,

799
00:43:05.750 --> 00:43:10.160
a young girl from the lower classes named John Doc or an English Joan of arc.

800
00:43:10.220 --> 00:43:14.240
Joan had claimed to have had a vision from saints telling her that it was her

801
00:43:14.241 --> 00:43:17.720
duty to drive out the English from France and she tried to tell the King of

802
00:43:17.721 --> 00:43:21.740
France the king was not interested at first until she made an accurate

803
00:43:21.741 --> 00:43:25.710
prediction regarding an upcoming battle.
After this,
that cane decided listen,

804
00:43:25.720 --> 00:43:29.300
and she claimed that she had to lead to the French army to relieve the city of

805
00:43:29.301 --> 00:43:30.620
Orly all from a siege.

806
00:43:30.680 --> 00:43:35.030
She did so and she was victorious and was subsequently made a commander of the

807
00:43:35.031 --> 00:43:37.640
French forces.
Now in this time period,

808
00:43:37.641 --> 00:43:41.540
the French would have been reluctant to accept a farm girl as a commander,

809
00:43:41.541 --> 00:43:44.840
but France was running out of options at this point and she seemed to be

810
00:43:44.841 --> 00:43:46.790
succeeding not long into the war.

811
00:43:46.791 --> 00:43:50.570
When she was only 19 though the Burgundians captured her and sold her to the

812
00:43:50.571 --> 00:43:54.470
English and the English found her guilty of heresy and burnt her out the stake.

813
00:43:55.040 --> 00:43:56.960
The English had finally captured Joan of arc,

814
00:43:56.961 --> 00:44:00.380
but her affect was irreversible and the French.
We're now winning the war.

815
00:44:00.440 --> 00:44:05.440
The war technically ends in 1453 at the battle Castillo where England lost all

816
00:44:05.871 --> 00:44:09.740
land in modern France except for Kallai and France securities victory.

817
00:44:09.741 --> 00:44:11.210
Even though officially speaking,

818
00:44:11.211 --> 00:44:15.290
the two nations would remain at war with each other for 20 more years or so and

819
00:44:15.291 --> 00:44:18.620
England would continue to claim the crown of France for many years to come.

820
00:44:18.710 --> 00:44:23.360
Following this war,
England would begin to enter the early modern era.
The social,

821
00:44:23.361 --> 00:44:24.230
technological,

822
00:44:24.231 --> 00:44:27.620
and governmental and such aspects of English society have been changing and

823
00:44:27.621 --> 00:44:30.230
would continue to change following the hundred years war,

824
00:44:30.500 --> 00:44:33.630
but another conflict had been brewing throughout the hundred years war.
However,

825
00:44:33.700 --> 00:44:35.130
internal conflict in England,

826
00:44:35.160 --> 00:44:38.790
one which would surface following the end of the war and the end of the reign of

827
00:44:38.791 --> 00:44:42.630
Henry does six who was considered a poor king and exacerbated by his wife

828
00:44:42.631 --> 00:44:45.900
Margaret.
Yvonne you the wars of the roses as it came to be called.

829
00:44:46.380 --> 00:44:49.830
The wars of the roses were a series of a civil conflicts of law for the control

830
00:44:49.831 --> 00:44:53.310
of the [inaudible] between the two houses of the Plantagenet dynasty.

831
00:44:53.460 --> 00:44:57.870
The Lancastrians represented by a red rose and the York is represented by a

832
00:44:57.871 --> 00:44:58.590
white rose.

833
00:44:58.590 --> 00:45:03.060
The conflict was not so cut and dry as it's often portrayed entails at the time,

834
00:45:03.061 --> 00:45:07.350
especially those from Shakespeare,
and even though it lasted for 30 years,

835
00:45:07.351 --> 00:45:12.100
it wasn't a brutal agonizing war on the part of the English people in the year

836
00:45:12.101 --> 00:45:15.880
1485 the conflict comes to an end as Henry the seven slaves,

837
00:45:15.881 --> 00:45:19.810
Richard the third at the battle of Bosworth field of battle which only claimed

838
00:45:19.811 --> 00:45:21.430
the lives of 2000 or so men,

839
00:45:21.431 --> 00:45:24.700
but mark the end of the English Middle Ages for good Henry,

840
00:45:24.701 --> 00:45:27.490
this seven to land cash room with questionable heritage,

841
00:45:27.491 --> 00:45:31.840
thus merges the two houses of York and Lancaster and to the house of tutor by

842
00:45:31.841 --> 00:45:34.240
marrying the daughter of Henry,
the fourth Elizabeth,

843
00:45:34.241 --> 00:45:37.570
which he represents with a white and red rose as shown here,

844
00:45:37.630 --> 00:45:39.730
and England moves on into a new age,

845
00:45:40.570 --> 00:45:42.970
though now the ruler of renaissance England,

846
00:45:42.971 --> 00:45:45.610
Henry to seven still had to clean up from the Middle Ages.

847
00:45:45.700 --> 00:45:48.760
The wars of the roses had fractured England's government and he struggled to

848
00:45:48.761 --> 00:45:50.920
hold onto his crown quite wisely.

849
00:45:50.921 --> 00:45:55.270
Henry pursued a peaceful foreign policy trying to improve ties with both

850
00:45:55.271 --> 00:45:56.560
Scotland and France.

851
00:45:57.130 --> 00:46:00.460
Henry to seventh died on April 21st,

852
00:46:00.460 --> 00:46:04.540
1509 he was succeeded by his 17 year old son who became Henry the eighth thereby

853
00:46:04.541 --> 00:46:07.090
securing the continuation of the Tudor Dynasty.

854
00:46:07.210 --> 00:46:10.390
Henry would be a very busy king though in the eyes of many of the day,

855
00:46:10.391 --> 00:46:11.380
not the best one.

856
00:46:11.440 --> 00:46:15.250
His older brother Arthur had died seven years prior to leaving the kingly duties

857
00:46:15.251 --> 00:46:19.210
to him.
In fact,
Henry would simply Mary his widow,
Katherine of Aragon,

858
00:46:19.270 --> 00:46:23.260
daughter of the king and queen of Spain.
Catherine would bear him two songs,

859
00:46:23.261 --> 00:46:24.940
but both would be stillborns.

860
00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:28.720
The inability to produce an heir would trouble Henry very much concerned with

861
00:46:28.721 --> 00:46:31.180
securing his succession and would not only trouble Henry,

862
00:46:31.181 --> 00:46:34.180
but what cause a good amount of trouble for England in years to come.

863
00:46:34.630 --> 00:46:35.441
In the meantime,

864
00:46:35.441 --> 00:46:39.520
Henry would engage in conflict with the French largely for personal glory as

865
00:46:39.521 --> 00:46:42.160
these wars that she is relatively little.
At the same time,

866
00:46:42.161 --> 00:46:43.780
Scotland would invade England,

867
00:46:43.781 --> 00:46:46.750
which would be another relatively pointless for for which Henry would take the

868
00:46:46.751 --> 00:46:47.620
credit and winning.

869
00:46:47.621 --> 00:46:50.830
Even though Katherine had managed the matter while Henry wasn't friends,

870
00:46:50.890 --> 00:46:53.470
Catherine was still failing to produce a male heir.

871
00:46:53.471 --> 00:46:54.940
Though she had produced a daughter,

872
00:46:55.030 --> 00:46:59.740
Mary Mary would be the only one of seven of Catherine's children who would live

873
00:46:59.741 --> 00:47:00.550
to adulthood.

874
00:47:00.550 --> 00:47:04.990
This deeply concerned Henry of female air in itself was a concern for a 16th

875
00:47:04.991 --> 00:47:05.801
century nation,

876
00:47:05.801 --> 00:47:09.730
let alone one for a nation which had just come out of the wars of the roses.

877
00:47:09.820 --> 00:47:11.850
Henry was determined to have a male heirs,

878
00:47:11.851 --> 00:47:14.920
so determined in fact that he would make an incredibly bold move.

879
00:47:14.950 --> 00:47:16.900
He was essentially left with three options.

880
00:47:17.560 --> 00:47:20.290
He could legitimize the one of his illegitimate sons,

881
00:47:20.500 --> 00:47:21.820
which would have been problematic.

882
00:47:22.420 --> 00:47:25.510
He could have attempted to have a grandson to inherit the throne,

883
00:47:25.511 --> 00:47:27.130
which would have also been problematic,

884
00:47:27.580 --> 00:47:30.160
or he could divorce his and marry a new one.

885
00:47:30.760 --> 00:47:34.720
He chose the third option in 1527 but the pope did not approve.

886
00:47:35.830 --> 00:47:37.180
So how does Henry respond?

887
00:47:37.510 --> 00:47:40.690
He leaves the church altogether and starts his own church,

888
00:47:41.110 --> 00:47:44.740
not while the English reformation,
as it's called,
was incredibly audacious.

889
00:47:44.741 --> 00:47:48.430
It did occur at the same time as the much larger Protestant reformation.

890
00:47:48.520 --> 00:47:52.150
Though the English reformation was quite obviously less about religion and more

891
00:47:52.151 --> 00:47:53.080
about politics.

892
00:47:53.230 --> 00:47:56.500
Henry was very serious about this or in the rest of England to convert to his

893
00:47:56.501 --> 00:48:00.400
religion and in fact executing many who actively resisted this schism would

894
00:48:00.401 --> 00:48:02.020
change English history permanently,

895
00:48:02.021 --> 00:48:05.470
throwing them into religious disagreement between Europeans for centuries.

896
00:48:05.560 --> 00:48:09.580
Henry would then Mary Anne Boleyn who would give birth to a daughter,
Elizabeth,

897
00:48:09.581 --> 00:48:14.050
and also very unfortunately a stillborn son out to center,
respond to this,

898
00:48:14.140 --> 00:48:15.220
not very maturely.

899
00:48:15.220 --> 00:48:19.840
He was convinced that he was cursed and he accused MLN of witchcraft and had her

900
00:48:19.850 --> 00:48:24.370
executed would then Mary Jane Seymour who would finally give him a son,
Edward.

901
00:48:24.580 --> 00:48:25.151
Unfortunately,

902
00:48:25.151 --> 00:48:29.410
Lo Jane Seymour would die from postpartum complications soon after Henry would

903
00:48:29.411 --> 00:48:33.850
marry three more times after her death producing only Mary Elizabeth and his son

904
00:48:33.851 --> 00:48:35.630
Edward,
who would succeed him as Edward,

905
00:48:35.631 --> 00:48:40.631
the six and 1547 and cruel irony though Edward would die before the age of 16

906
00:48:41.231 --> 00:48:45.670
from tuberculosis leaving only Mary and Elizabeth to inherit the throne.
Mary.

907
00:48:45.700 --> 00:48:50.170
After doing a way with lady Jane Gray became queen in 1553 there was an

908
00:48:50.171 --> 00:48:54.040
interesting twist to this though Mary was a Catholic and was quite adamant about

909
00:48:54.041 --> 00:48:55.750
returning England to Catholicism,

910
00:48:55.870 --> 00:49:00.280
so after the English had been bullied and face death for resisting Anglicanism,

911
00:49:00.340 --> 00:49:03.190
now Mary turn it around and bullied and executed.

912
00:49:03.191 --> 00:49:06.010
Anglicans refused to convert back to Catholicism.

913
00:49:06.220 --> 00:49:10.900
This was not the time to be openly pious and Mary Burns nearly 300 Protestants

914
00:49:10.901 --> 00:49:14.620
alive.
As a result,
she was given a nickname at bloody Mary.

915
00:49:14.800 --> 00:49:18.250
Mary died in 1558 and the English did not miss her.

916
00:49:18.310 --> 00:49:21.460
Despite attempts to secure a Catholic on the throne,
including Philip,

917
00:49:21.461 --> 00:49:24.970
her husband,
and King of Spain,
she would be succeeded by her Protestant house.

918
00:49:24.971 --> 00:49:29.971
Sister Elizabeth Elizabeth would rule for nearly 50 years ushering in a golden

919
00:49:29.981 --> 00:49:32.590
age and English history known as the Elizabethan era.

920
00:49:32.680 --> 00:49:36.730
One of Elizabeth's first acts was of course,
return England to Protestantism.

921
00:49:36.880 --> 00:49:40.120
This led to the pope declaring her it legitimate and a heretic.

922
00:49:40.150 --> 00:49:44.140
Yet Elizabeth quite wisely was not as aggressive consulting Protestantism as her

923
00:49:44.141 --> 00:49:47.350
predecessors have been.
She was more tolerant of Catholics and accordingly,

924
00:49:47.351 --> 00:49:50.470
she maintained a decent amount of peace in England between a different religious

925
00:49:50.471 --> 00:49:54.400
groups.
At the day.
Elizabeth never married and had no children earning her.

926
00:49:54.401 --> 00:49:55.090
The title,

927
00:49:55.090 --> 00:49:59.140
the Virgin Queen later on the English would name a North American colony after

928
00:49:59.141 --> 00:50:03.130
her Virginia.
Why she chose to never marry is unknown.

929
00:50:03.310 --> 00:50:06.400
She claimed that her husband was England and her children were the English

930
00:50:06.401 --> 00:50:06.850
people.

931
00:50:06.850 --> 00:50:10.360
Although it's very likely linked to the political instability that a marriage

932
00:50:10.361 --> 00:50:12.220
might've caused,
especially for a queen,

933
00:50:12.640 --> 00:50:16.330
but she did in fact have many suitors and she fell in love with a man named

934
00:50:16.331 --> 00:50:18.340
Robert Dudley.
Under Elizabeth's reign,

935
00:50:18.341 --> 00:50:21.880
English renaissance culture would flourish and most notable figure of this time

936
00:50:21.881 --> 00:50:25.120
being William Shakespeare considered perhaps one of the greatest writers in

937
00:50:25.121 --> 00:50:25.954
human history.

938
00:50:26.440 --> 00:50:30.110
Just because Elizabeth was more tolerant towards English Catholics is not mean

939
00:50:30.111 --> 00:50:34.070
that foreign Catholic nations were tolerant towards her and she would be forced

940
00:50:34.071 --> 00:50:37.510
to deal with the plus and conflicts of other major Catholic powers of days such

941
00:50:37.511 --> 00:50:38.690
as France and Spain.

942
00:50:38.930 --> 00:50:42.200
One of her first moves regarding this political and religious situation was to

943
00:50:42.201 --> 00:50:46.100
spread Protestantism in Scotland there by attempting to break the Franco

944
00:50:46.100 --> 00:50:46.611
Scottish alliance,

945
00:50:46.611 --> 00:50:50.270
knowing that France could use Scotland as an ally in a potential war as it had

946
00:50:50.271 --> 00:50:51.860
done many times throughout history.

947
00:50:52.250 --> 00:50:55.250
Part of the reason for this threat came from Mary,
the Queen of the Scots,

948
00:50:55.251 --> 00:50:58.340
who had also been the queen of France for only a year,
and furthermore,

949
00:50:58.341 --> 00:51:00.030
the great granddaughter of Henry [inaudible],

950
00:51:00.031 --> 00:51:04.370
seventh of England Catholic Europe recognized marry a Catholic as the rifle

951
00:51:04.371 --> 00:51:07.520
ruler of England and she married Henry Stewart and English Catholic with a

952
00:51:07.521 --> 00:51:10.640
client,
had the English throne as well.
Quite naturally this concern,

953
00:51:10.670 --> 00:51:13.700
it was a beds greatly and she would spend years feuding with her.

954
00:51:13.790 --> 00:51:17.150
Eventually marry was actually asked by the Scottish nobility and she fled to

955
00:51:17.151 --> 00:51:18.440
England for protection.

956
00:51:18.560 --> 00:51:22.280
Elizabeth would not have it though when she imprisons marry for 18 and a half

957
00:51:22.281 --> 00:51:25.940
years until finally she had her executed for clotting to assassinator.

958
00:51:26.090 --> 00:51:28.760
Elizabeth would attempt to avoid conflict throughout her reign.

959
00:51:28.761 --> 00:51:32.630
Now she did send forces to assist Dutch Protestants against the Catholic Spanish

960
00:51:32.631 --> 00:51:33.680
rulers while Spain.

961
00:51:33.710 --> 00:51:37.550
Accordingly support of the Catholic Irish against the English meddling like this

962
00:51:37.551 --> 00:51:42.551
would lead to the Anglo Spanish war in 1585 the situation was exacerbated in

963
00:51:42.801 --> 00:51:46.700
1587 when Mary,
the queen of Scots was executed.
This outrage,

964
00:51:46.701 --> 00:51:47.720
King Philip of Spain,

965
00:51:47.750 --> 00:51:51.080
Mary had left in her will that Phillip would inherit her claim to the English

966
00:51:51.081 --> 00:51:54.380
throne should she be killed and Phillip vowed to put a Catholic monarch on the

967
00:51:54.381 --> 00:51:58.100
English throne and in fact received support from the pope to overthrow her.

968
00:51:58.160 --> 00:52:02.120
He began preparing a fleet.
However,
it was sabotaged by Sir Francis Drake.

969
00:52:02.150 --> 00:52:04.760
A year later the Spanish we repair and set sail for England,

970
00:52:04.761 --> 00:52:08.980
but English tactics as well as unfavorable weather successfully repelled
Spanish.

971
00:52:08.981 --> 00:52:12.560
Our motto while under the command of Charles Howard and again Francis Drake

972
00:52:12.620 --> 00:52:13.840
while addressing her Forrest,

973
00:52:13.841 --> 00:52:17.090
is in preparation for potential Spanish invasion on the island.

974
00:52:17.091 --> 00:52:19.820
Elizabeth is quoted as saying,
my loving people.

975
00:52:19.821 --> 00:52:23.450
We have been persuaded by some that are careful of our safety to take heed how

976
00:52:23.451 --> 00:52:26.450
we commit ourselves to armed multitudes for fear of treachery.

977
00:52:26.510 --> 00:52:30.170
But I assure you I do not desire to live to distrust my faithful and loving

978
00:52:30.171 --> 00:52:33.260
people.
I know I have the body but have a weak and feeble woman,

979
00:52:33.320 --> 00:52:37.310
but I have the heart and stomach of a king and of a King of England too,

980
00:52:37.370 --> 00:52:41.210
and I think fell scoring that Parma or Spain or any prints of Europe should dare

981
00:52:41.211 --> 00:52:42.920
to innovate the borders of my room.

982
00:52:43.310 --> 00:52:46.880
Elizabeth had defended the Protestant religion in England and she had defended

983
00:52:46.881 --> 00:52:48.290
it from foreign rule as well.

984
00:52:48.350 --> 00:52:51.680
She led England during a time in which great figures such as Shakespeare,

985
00:52:51.681 --> 00:52:52.520
Francis Bacon,

986
00:52:52.521 --> 00:52:56.390
and Francis Drake were alive and by successfully challenging Spanish power.

987
00:52:56.391 --> 00:52:59.120
She paved the way for England to become a greater power,

988
00:52:59.121 --> 00:53:01.640
thereby opening a road to the Americas.

989
00:53:02.120 --> 00:53:05.330
She died in 1603 as the last tutor monarch.

990
00:53:05.390 --> 00:53:08.930
She would be succeeded by King James at first who was also king of Scotland.

991
00:53:08.931 --> 00:53:13.400
Being a son of Mary,
queen of Scots,
despite being the son of an ardent Catholic,

992
00:53:13.401 --> 00:53:17.420
James had converted to Protestantism and was intent on keeping England that way.

993
00:53:17.480 --> 00:53:19.970
We'll pick up a one happens with James and the next video.

994
00:53:20.120 --> 00:53:22.310
For more videos like this and videos on many other subjects,

996
