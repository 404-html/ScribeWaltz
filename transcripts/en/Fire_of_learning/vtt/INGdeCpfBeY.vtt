00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.350
Hello and welcome to fire of learning the 18th and 19th century,

2
00:00:04.351 --> 00:00:09.060
a period in which warfare seems to stand apart from other periods in terms of

3
00:00:09.061 --> 00:00:12.840
how wars were fought,
a stereotypical scene of this era,

4
00:00:12.841 --> 00:00:17.640
our soldiers are arranged in groups,
in lines,
dressed and colorful uniforms,

5
00:00:17.641 --> 00:00:18.690
wielding muskets,

6
00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.340
marching towards each other calmly and taking almost choreographed shots at each

7
00:00:23.341 --> 00:00:28.260
other at close range from the chaotic and explosive nature of war today.

8
00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:33.330
That seems ridiculous and in fact suicidal.
Why will they fight like that?

9
00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.730
A common response is that it was about honor that war was orchestrated by

10
00:00:38.731 --> 00:00:43.500
gentlemen at this time.
Even sometimes that it looked nice and professional.

11
00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.660
Well on the surface.

12
00:00:45.661 --> 00:00:50.661
War was at this time considered a gentleman's dual on a larger scale by some and

13
00:00:51.511 --> 00:00:54.120
honor and such.
Things were very important,

14
00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:56.940
but that's not why soldiers fought in lines.

15
00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.290
War at this time was as brutal and bloody as any other,

16
00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.500
and logically,
of course,
if it were about honor,

17
00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.100
all the commander would have to do is say,
forget,
honor,

18
00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:12.060
switched to a more effective tactic and the battle would be his.

19
00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.480
There was a reason for this style of warfare.
In fact,

20
00:01:15.481 --> 00:01:19.020
many reasons that wars are fought like this.
Firstly,

21
00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.560
muskets and the guns of today are very different.

22
00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:27.720
A Brown bess musket that a redcoat would have carried during the revolutionary

23
00:01:27.721 --> 00:01:32.721
war had an effective range of a maximum of a hundred yards and in altogether

24
00:01:33.361 --> 00:01:36.870
range of 300 or so yards or about 900 feet.

25
00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:40.860
It was hard to be accurate because the barrels were smooth and the bullets were

26
00:01:40.861 --> 00:01:42.780
essentially round balls of led.

27
00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:45.780
The ball could curve and miss the target very significantly,

28
00:01:45.781 --> 00:01:50.400
so you definitely would not want your comrade standing in front of you as a

29
00:01:50.401 --> 00:01:51.211
muzzle loader.

30
00:01:51.211 --> 00:01:55.260
A trained soldier could get off about three rounds a minute or obviously one

31
00:01:55.261 --> 00:01:58.350
shot about every 20 seconds accordingly,

32
00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.620
with guns that are slow and have short range,

33
00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:06.180
putting your men together in lines who fire in successive waves from the first

34
00:02:06.181 --> 00:02:07.340
rank to the second ranked,

35
00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:11.760
the third allow the soldiers to inflict much more damage than if they were

36
00:02:11.761 --> 00:02:13.740
spread out.
Secondly,

37
00:02:13.741 --> 00:02:17.970
remember that there were cavalry and artillery to contend with as well.

38
00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:23.310
While artillery did target these clothes,
line formations fighting spread out,

39
00:02:23.311 --> 00:02:25.530
made you very vulnerable to cavalry.

40
00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:29.760
If you spread out your infantry cavalry could ride straight through them and

41
00:02:29.761 --> 00:02:33.450
they could even be more susceptible to a melee charged from infantry.

42
00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:38.400
Keeping them together allowed them to act as a wall and they could even form

43
00:02:38.401 --> 00:02:41.580
things like square formations against incoming cavalry.

44
00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:46.380
The square information was infamously successful at the battle of Waterloo

45
00:02:46.381 --> 00:02:50.250
against Napoleon where the British and Prussians and other allied forces

46
00:02:50.251 --> 00:02:53.820
repelled French cavalry several times.
And thirdly,

47
00:02:53.821 --> 00:02:58.020
keep in mind that communications were much more simple during this era as well.

48
00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:02.140
Shouts drums,
trumpets and flags were how armies communicated.

49
00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:07.480
Not only could prolonged communication efforts slow the advance of an army,

50
00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:10.090
but if a spread out army were divided,

51
00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:14.680
communication would break down and a proper defense or assault could not be

52
00:03:14.681 --> 00:03:18.460
coordinated.
Now you may be thinking,
well,
that makes sense,

53
00:03:18.461 --> 00:03:23.140
but what about skirmishers or guerrilla warriors?
Why didn't those work?

54
00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:27.370
Well,
they could have and they did.
Napoleon's voltage genre,
for example,

55
00:03:27.371 --> 00:03:29.830
or the Pandora's fighting in the Austrian army.

56
00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:34.930
Both skirmish or units often fought and looser formations to harass the enemy

57
00:03:34.931 --> 00:03:38.620
and take off soldiers,
but fell back during the heavier fighting.

58
00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:43.000
Furthermore,
guerrilla warfare happened quite often in this time.
In fact,

59
00:03:43.001 --> 00:03:45.670
the term guerrilla warfare originated in his time.

60
00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:49.510
It referred originally to the Spanish soldiers who fought against the points

61
00:03:49.511 --> 00:03:54.010
forces with ambushes,
hit and run tactics,
raids,
and sabotage.

62
00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:57.850
Another example of this would be the British Rogers Rangers,

63
00:03:57.851 --> 00:04:01.330
or also known as the Queen's Rangers during the French and Indian war,

64
00:04:01.331 --> 00:04:03.400
and also the American war of independence.

65
00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:07.450
The French and their native allies also had guerrilla warfare soldiers in the

66
00:04:07.451 --> 00:04:11.200
war,
and the American soldiers relied heavily on it during the revolution,

67
00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:14.620
especially during the earlier parts of it.
And so now,

68
00:04:14.621 --> 00:04:16.600
to the final point with this question,

69
00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:21.580
how could soldiers have handled standing there with the potential of being shot

70
00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:25.300
in an open field,
not even grown men,
but teenagers even as well.

71
00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:29.470
It would have to be psychologically agonizing to stand there and face the enemy

72
00:04:29.471 --> 00:04:31.390
in such a manner.
Well,

73
00:04:31.391 --> 00:04:36.100
that's where the heavy discipline and the officers came in militias.
As a result,

74
00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:40.270
we're often very unreliable.
Usually they were quick to flee.
In fact,

75
00:04:40.271 --> 00:04:45.271
George Washington actually himself said that relying on militia was like resting

76
00:04:45.461 --> 00:04:48.700
on a broken staff.
But even with more professional infantry,

77
00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:53.320
one of the main jobs of the officers who commanded them was to control them from

78
00:04:53.321 --> 00:04:55.720
fleeing.
And even with all this,

79
00:04:55.750 --> 00:05:00.640
much of these battles eventually came down to melee combat after the two sides

80
00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:01.750
valleyed a few times.

81
00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:05.320
They fixed bayonets and charged into each other quite commonly.

82
00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:06.760
As you might expect,

83
00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:11.820
this style of warfare started to go out of style during the later 19th century.

84
00:05:11.981 --> 00:05:15.250
When better,
more accurate rifles became more common.

85
00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:20.080
Thus fighting in lines created massacres such as in the American civil war,

86
00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:21.370
when machine guns,

87
00:05:21.371 --> 00:05:26.170
radios and tanks enter the scene and the 20th century it was definitely done

88
00:05:26.171 --> 00:05:29.110
for,
and thus,
I hope I've answered your question.
