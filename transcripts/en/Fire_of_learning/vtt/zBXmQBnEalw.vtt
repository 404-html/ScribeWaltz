00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:01.980
Hello and welcome to fire of learning.

2
00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:06.330
Today I'd like to talk about one of the most incredible things our civilization

3
00:00:06.331 --> 00:00:11.331
is capable of doing and that is the process of reengineering an entire planet or

4
00:00:11.851 --> 00:00:15.960
moon to be suitable for earth life and subsequently to call night as those

5
00:00:15.961 --> 00:00:19.440
worlds a process known commonly as terraforming.

6
00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:24.300
Tara is Latin for earth,
so obviously it means to make like earth.

7
00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.100
It sounds like science fiction,

8
00:00:26.101 --> 00:00:29.130
but it may be coming to a planet near you much sooner than you think.

9
00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:30.480
Hypothetically,

10
00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:34.110
we could begin reengineering our best candidates today if we wanted to,

11
00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:38.790
but how and where and why,
what we're going to cover all of that.

12
00:00:38.791 --> 00:00:39.660
So let's get to it.

13
00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:45.000
So what needs have to be fulfilled for us to be able to live on another world

14
00:00:45.001 --> 00:00:47.010
indefinitely and independently?

15
00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.360
Scientists have talked about colonizing basically every planet and major moon in

16
00:00:51.361 --> 00:00:54.840
the solar system.
We could maybe build cities and gas giants,

17
00:00:54.841 --> 00:00:57.420
atmospheres or bases on large asteroids,

18
00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.670
but we're talking about terraforming here.

19
00:00:59.671 --> 00:01:02.160
So we'll need something a bit more down to earth.

20
00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.390
Rocky worlds liked for inner planets.
Mercury,
Venus,

21
00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.650
Earth and Mars are as moon Jupiter's moons also called the Jovian moons and

22
00:01:10.651 --> 00:01:14.460
Saturn's moon.
Titan can therefore start off as our main candidates.

23
00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:20.040
These are mostly excellent worlds to consider building cities on however to

24
00:01:20.041 --> 00:01:20.970
recreate earth.

25
00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.630
Another important feature is obviously the ability to retain an earth like

26
00:01:24.631 --> 00:01:26.430
atmosphere and temperatures.

27
00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.330
We needed an atmospheric density of about one bar and one which keeps

28
00:01:30.331 --> 00:01:34.440
temperatures at an ideal range constantly around every star.

29
00:01:34.441 --> 00:01:38.130
There is a range in which a planet which could theoretically sustained surface

30
00:01:38.131 --> 00:01:41.460
life as we know it would have to exist called the habitable zone.

31
00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.910
The zone is based on the area around the star.

32
00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:48.600
Wearing water can exist on the surface of a hypothetical earthlight world.

33
00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.620
Scientists use it all the time when looking at exoplanets to determine potential

34
00:01:52.621 --> 00:01:53.454
habitability,

35
00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:58.440
our son's habitable zone begins around Venus and ends around Mars.

36
00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.700
This alone excludes the Jovian moons,
Mercury and tightened,

37
00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.670
and even if somehow the temperature issues were fixed,

38
00:02:05.671 --> 00:02:08.790
these other worlds have other problems which would prevent terraforming.

39
00:02:08.791 --> 00:02:12.900
Still the only be discussed briefly later on seeing as how Maurice has moons are

40
00:02:12.901 --> 00:02:17.190
in reality just captured asteroids.
This leaves Venus,
the Moon and Mars.

41
00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:20.220
Next we need a suitable level of gravity.

42
00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.920
Gravity is necessary for a number of reasons.

43
00:02:22.921 --> 00:02:27.750
A world first of all has to maintain an atmosphere you the gravity is too low,

44
00:02:27.751 --> 00:02:31.530
the atmosphere will be lost the space over time.
Secondly,

45
00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.390
as astronauts have found out the hard way,

46
00:02:33.391 --> 00:02:37.350
spending too much time and low gravity is bad for the health.
In fact,

47
00:02:37.351 --> 00:02:39.810
over the course of years in low g as it's called,

48
00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:43.590
it will lead to a pleather of health problems and eventually death.

49
00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:48.630
Venus is gravity at 90% that diverse is probably not an all an issue.

50
00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:50.190
The Moon,
however,

51
00:02:50.191 --> 00:02:55.191
at 16% could be a serious strain on health long term and could probably not hold

52
00:02:55.231 --> 00:02:59.620
an atmosphere long enough so the moon is out.
It's gravity is simply too low.

53
00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:05.040
Whether the 38% earth gravity that Maurice has a sufficient remains uncertain.

54
00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:09.760
Mara's has in the past held a thick enough atmosphere for surface water to be

55
00:03:09.761 --> 00:03:14.680
held in a long term and it may be just high enough to avoid health problems or

56
00:03:14.681 --> 00:03:18.940
at least for those problems to be overcome somehow transitioning from low

57
00:03:18.941 --> 00:03:23.170
gravity Mars earth would be difficult for potential future vacationers coming

58
00:03:23.171 --> 00:03:24.160
back to the home world,

59
00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:28.210
but we will of course include Mars in our terraforming discussion because

60
00:03:28.211 --> 00:03:31.390
despite the fact that even though the gravity issue is uncertain,

61
00:03:31.391 --> 00:03:33.010
Mars is too many people.

62
00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:36.790
The best candidate of all the candidates for terraforming in the solar system.

63
00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:41.320
This leaves Mars and Venus as a prime candidates for terror forming and our

64
00:03:41.321 --> 00:03:42.154
solar system,

65
00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:46.510
they're both large rocky worlds with potentially suitable gravity and distance

66
00:03:46.511 --> 00:03:47.344
from the sun.

67
00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:52.330
They're not unrealistically far either a trip to Venus or Mars other closest to

68
00:03:52.331 --> 00:03:56.290
earth is under six months and that could be improved on as technology advances.

69
00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:00.670
Crucially,
they both have water,
Mars much more so than Venus,

70
00:04:00.671 --> 00:04:03.940
but in the right conditions,
oceans would form on both worlds.

71
00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:07.180
Sometimes even they already remind us of home,

72
00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:12.930
but the key here in my opinion is that this is not all theoretical travel back 4

73
00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:17.650
billion years is so to the infancy of the solar system and you might not be able

74
00:04:17.651 --> 00:04:20.650
to easily tell which planet is earth at first.

75
00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:25.420
That's because of this time Mars and Venus both had large bodies of liquid water

76
00:04:25.421 --> 00:04:29.530
on the surface over time.
However,
Mars and Venus lust this habitability,

77
00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:32.500
whether they developed life is of course unknown,

78
00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:37.450
whether they retain that life is also a known but only earth developed into a

79
00:04:37.451 --> 00:04:40.150
stable world,
flourishing with a diversity of life.

80
00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:44.110
The challenge of terraforming therefore is to return Mars and Venus if those

81
00:04:44.111 --> 00:04:48.040
conditions aren't officially and then gradually introduce earth life.

82
00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:52.360
Our microorganisms are plants,
our animals and of course ourselves,

83
00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:56.320
and of course it should be able to be kept that way indefinitely.
Now,

84
00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:58.360
let's run through some basic issues here.

85
00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:02.770
Mars and Venus coincidentally have many opposite problems,

86
00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:06.580
so we're going to have to develop different game plans for each world.

87
00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:09.040
Venus is far too hot.

88
00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:14.070
The surface temperature averages at 462 degrees Celsius or 860 degrees

89
00:05:14.081 --> 00:05:14.890
Fahrenheit.

90
00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:19.000
That atmosphere contains a number of toxic chemicals and it's heavy to the

91
00:05:19.001 --> 00:05:22.150
atmospheric pressure on Venus is 90 times out of earth,

92
00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:23.740
which would essentially crush you.

93
00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:27.790
Other problems which we'll discuss exists such as another feature.

94
00:05:27.791 --> 00:05:30.730
The fact that Venus rotates incredibly slowly.

95
00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:35.500
That is to say that one day on Venus last 188 earth days.

96
00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:37.990
This may just be a major inconvenience though,

97
00:05:37.991 --> 00:05:41.470
not necessarily a make or break problem.
On the other hand,

98
00:05:41.471 --> 00:05:45.310
the surface temperature of Mars is about negative 81 degrees Fahrenheit or a

99
00:05:45.311 --> 00:05:47.020
negative 62 degrees Celsius.

100
00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:50.260
The atmosphere is 100 times less dense than the earth,

101
00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:53.980
so even if it were warm enough for liquid water to exist on the surface,

102
00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:58.610
there wouldn't be enough pressure for it to remain in that form.
Coincidentally,

103
00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:02.480
Mars is day is only slightly longer than the,
it's just above 24 hours,

104
00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:05.480
but the year is twice as long.
However,

105
00:06:05.481 --> 00:06:10.190
of course that's not necessarily an impediment to life or anything important to

106
00:06:10.191 --> 00:06:14.570
note though both planets also lack of suitable magnetic field to protect from

107
00:06:14.571 --> 00:06:17.300
solar radiation that were shielded from here on earth.

108
00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:21.680
This radiation could cause serious problems for life even if other conditions

109
00:06:21.681 --> 00:06:25.610
are working out.
So naturally we'll have to figure something out for that.

110
00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:27.350
And for whatever reason,

111
00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:31.520
the magnetic field issue is an issue which is not very commonly discussed in

112
00:06:31.521 --> 00:06:33.080
terraforming conversations,
itching.

113
00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:37.880
It's an issue which is sometimes ignored and they understand that it's the bane

114
00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:41.330
of a tear formers existence because it's an issue that is not easily solved.

115
00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:45.830
However,
there are solutions to it and we will be discussing those in this video.

116
00:06:45.831 --> 00:06:48.140
So even if you're already kind of familiar with terra forming,

117
00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:52.880
you may be introduced to some new things through this video.
Back to Mars.

118
00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:55.940
Perhaps you've noticed as many scientists have,

119
00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:59.330
it sounds like Mars needs a dose of global warming,

120
00:06:59.331 --> 00:07:01.400
something we already know how to do.

121
00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:05.870
The first step to terraforming Mars is to get the surface warmer and the

122
00:07:05.871 --> 00:07:08.420
atmosphere thicker.
We know how to do that.

123
00:07:08.421 --> 00:07:11.510
We're doing it here on earth and it is a Middle East creating problems,

124
00:07:11.511 --> 00:07:14.780
but on Mars the same process will be beneficial to life.

125
00:07:15.170 --> 00:07:20.170
The question is how importing fossil fuels from earth is extremely impractical,

126
00:07:20.301 --> 00:07:24.650
especially from the viewpoint of modern technological limits and even if done

127
00:07:24.651 --> 00:07:26.900
intentionally would probably take too long.

128
00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:31.310
We might have to resort to more extreme local methods for raising the

129
00:07:31.311 --> 00:07:34.490
temperature.
If we can raise Mars,
his temperature was sufficient.

130
00:07:34.491 --> 00:07:37.400
Greenhouse gas emissions that will cause more gas he released,

131
00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:40.490
which will then aid and raising the temperature as well to an even greater

132
00:07:40.491 --> 00:07:41.324
degree.

133
00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:45.950
One theory made popular by though not originating with Elon Musk is to drop

134
00:07:45.951 --> 00:07:48.080
nuclear bombs on the planet's polls,

135
00:07:48.290 --> 00:07:52.640
which hold large amounts of frozen carbon dioxide or well known greenhouse gas

136
00:07:52.940 --> 00:07:56.630
in this forum known more commonly here on Earth as dry ice.

137
00:07:57.260 --> 00:08:00.290
This obviously creates the problem of nuclear fallout,

138
00:08:00.291 --> 00:08:04.880
but an even bigger issue is how to ship an entire arsenal of nuclear weapons

139
00:08:04.881 --> 00:08:06.080
throughout the solar system.

140
00:08:06.710 --> 00:08:10.370
Asteroids redirected to hit Mars as Paul's would have a similar effect.

141
00:08:10.820 --> 00:08:14.620
There are more a gentle suggestions to raising the temperature is such as mask

142
00:08:14.621 --> 00:08:17.630
in the surface and a darker substance in a natural soil,

143
00:08:17.660 --> 00:08:21.560
specifically the Poles so that less sunlight is reflected back into space.

144
00:08:21.860 --> 00:08:25.610
Thankfully,
Mars's moons are some of the darkest objects in the solar system,

145
00:08:25.611 --> 00:08:28.280
so with source for such as substance would be nearby.

146
00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:32.510
Another suggestion is to place giant mirrors in orbit around Mars to redirect

147
00:08:32.511 --> 00:08:36.200
more sunlight to hit the planet,
thus causing the temperature to rise.

148
00:08:36.770 --> 00:08:40.430
Personally,
I don't see how combining several tactics is a bad idea,

149
00:08:40.431 --> 00:08:44.570
especially if we're looking to get the atmosphere suitable within 100 to 200

150
00:08:44.571 --> 00:08:47.690
years.
Regardless of how we approach it,

151
00:08:47.691 --> 00:08:51.800
I think it would be wise to introduce life onto the surface as soon as possible.

152
00:08:51.860 --> 00:08:55.980
Cyanobacteria are a prime candidate for the first.
Some Mars.

153
00:08:56.550 --> 00:08:59.250
There are rugged life form called an extreme of file,

154
00:08:59.251 --> 00:09:03.390
meaning they thrive and conditions which most life would find in hospital.

155
00:09:04.050 --> 00:09:06.870
Theoretically speaking,
this could include Mars.

156
00:09:07.350 --> 00:09:11.130
CYANOBACTERIA would be instrumental in preparing the surface her other life

157
00:09:11.131 --> 00:09:15.270
forms such as plants by lacing the soil with nitrogen and other elements and

158
00:09:15.271 --> 00:09:19.020
converting the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and to breathable oxygen like

159
00:09:19.021 --> 00:09:22.350
they do here on earth as well as creating an ozone layer.

160
00:09:22.590 --> 00:09:26.970
Cyanobacteria is also edible and can be used as fuel and environment with no

161
00:09:26.971 --> 00:09:27.810
fossil fuels,

162
00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:32.610
no wind power and less powerful solar power sign of bacteria have a good work

163
00:09:32.611 --> 00:09:33.444
reference as well.

164
00:09:33.450 --> 00:09:36.900
They've already accomplished much of this on earth and are responsible in part

165
00:09:37.290 --> 00:09:42.120
for turning the planet into the habit of a world it is today.
However,

166
00:09:42.300 --> 00:09:45.210
before we start introducing earth life to Mars,

167
00:09:45.270 --> 00:09:50.270
we need to be certain of one thing that there is not already life on the plant.

168
00:09:51.210 --> 00:09:53.850
The same issue must be addressed for Venus as well,

169
00:09:53.851 --> 00:09:56.610
but it's much more likely that Mars how has slack than Venus?

170
00:09:56.611 --> 00:09:59.910
Although I've talked about how both are possible and pass videos.

171
00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:05.250
If either world host's living organisms introducing our life to their planet,

172
00:10:05.251 --> 00:10:08.250
imprudently could seriously damaged their ecosystem,

173
00:10:08.251 --> 00:10:13.251
maybe irreparably almost certainly if life were found on Mars,

174
00:10:13.770 --> 00:10:17.970
it would not be more advanced in bacteria and though perhaps biologically

175
00:10:17.971 --> 00:10:22.110
independent from earth life,
but probably function very similarly.

176
00:10:22.470 --> 00:10:26.620
This brings us to a philosophical debate within the scientific community and

177
00:10:26.690 --> 00:10:30.960
what do we do if that's the case,
how does life being found on another planet?

178
00:10:30.961 --> 00:10:34.140
Change our plans for colonization?
As I said,

179
00:10:34.141 --> 00:10:37.050
we could damage the Martian ecosystem by terraforming the plant.

180
00:10:37.290 --> 00:10:41.310
Some argue that avoiding terraforming and colonization for this reason is

181
00:10:41.311 --> 00:10:45.000
essentially sacrificing the future of humanity for an organism.

182
00:10:45.001 --> 00:10:46.740
No more complex than bacteria.

183
00:10:47.190 --> 00:10:51.300
Other people see this as interfering with the biology of another world.

184
00:10:51.301 --> 00:10:55.590
For our own selfish purposes considering that native marsh in life would

185
00:10:55.591 --> 00:10:59.430
probably do much better in a terraform and climate because as I said,

186
00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:02.460
it would be in all likelihood similar to earth life.

187
00:11:02.970 --> 00:11:06.300
Many people suggest coexistence,
but again,

188
00:11:06.870 --> 00:11:10.020
even among the most ardent terra formers and astrobiologists,

189
00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:13.860
there is a disagreement and I'd like to take this opportunity to note

190
00:11:13.890 --> 00:11:16.440
specifically for those who claim that philosophy is dead,

191
00:11:16.830 --> 00:11:19.890
that despite all this incredible technology and science,

192
00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:23.820
none of it can be put to use before our philosophical questions are answered as

193
00:11:23.821 --> 00:11:26.610
well.
I will mention though,
in case you're wondering,

194
00:11:26.611 --> 00:11:28.920
as I discussed in one of my earlier videos,

195
00:11:29.130 --> 00:11:32.940
Martian life is almost certainly not going to cause diseases in humans,

196
00:11:33.450 --> 00:11:37.620
infectious bacteria and viruses and all of that have to evolve specifically to

197
00:11:37.621 --> 00:11:40.200
penetrate and function in another organism.

198
00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:45.200
Obviously there has never been in 4.5 billion years such an opportunity on Mars,

199
00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:47.130
so you are not going to be contaminated.

200
00:11:47.131 --> 00:11:51.240
It's more likely that our organisms are going to disrupt the natural habitat of

201
00:11:51.241 --> 00:11:54.610
any native organisms there over the course of decades.

202
00:11:54.611 --> 00:11:57.910
Assuming we employ combined strategies to terraforming the planet.

203
00:11:58.360 --> 00:12:01.750
Mars is that Mrs t were thick and the planet would begin to warm up.

204
00:12:02.050 --> 00:12:07.030
It would snow on Mars,
it would rain,
rivers would flow ocean to begin to form,

205
00:12:07.031 --> 00:12:09.970
and the planet may eventually looked something like this.

206
00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:14.530
The next step would be to introduce more complex plant life to surface to really

207
00:12:14.531 --> 00:12:17.080
begin converting the carbon dioxide into oxygen.

208
00:12:17.410 --> 00:12:21.160
I've imagined plain like machines flying over certain areas of Mars just

209
00:12:21.161 --> 00:12:23.650
dropping thousands and thousands of plants.
Seeds.

210
00:12:23.740 --> 00:12:27.430
These plants may in all likelihood be genetically engineered to be darker,

211
00:12:27.431 --> 00:12:32.290
to attract more sunlight or to produce more oxygen within another centuries.

212
00:12:32.300 --> 00:12:34.780
So the Martian surface can be very green,

213
00:12:35.530 --> 00:12:38.710
perhaps with heaviest systems from artificial methods.

214
00:12:38.890 --> 00:12:42.960
Columnist on the planet could leave their giant artificial dome cities and take

215
00:12:42.961 --> 00:12:46.690
off their helmets outside and breathe the Martian air for the first time.

216
00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:51.760
Once that is possible,
a day on Mars would look a lot like a day on earth.

217
00:12:52.270 --> 00:12:56.170
You can try to imagine walking outside on a warm or night on Mars from your

218
00:12:56.171 --> 00:13:00.370
futuristic house among the first few generations of forests and green hills and

219
00:13:00.371 --> 00:13:02.320
such and looking up at the sky.

220
00:13:03.010 --> 00:13:06.040
The constellations would all appear as they do here on earth,

221
00:13:06.041 --> 00:13:08.710
despite the fact that they'd move slightly differently.

222
00:13:09.340 --> 00:13:11.830
And by that I mean the North Star for example,

223
00:13:11.831 --> 00:13:15.910
wouldn't be the north star because Mars has tilt is slightly different instead

224
00:13:15.911 --> 00:13:19.300
of one giant moon.
However,
as we're used to here on earth,

225
00:13:19.660 --> 00:13:24.100
Martians would see two asteroids.
The more visible being Phobos and Deimos,

226
00:13:24.130 --> 00:13:27.820
which would appear smaller than Phobos as a large point of light in the sky.

227
00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:32.890
Importantly in that sky as well would be a significant Pale bluish star.

228
00:13:32.920 --> 00:13:35.320
Not really a star,
but a planet earth,

229
00:13:36.460 --> 00:13:38.560
earth from the sky of Mars,
Venus,

230
00:13:38.561 --> 00:13:40.750
or anywhere else in the solar system for that matter,

231
00:13:40.751 --> 00:13:44.710
closer to than Saturn would serve as a reminder to the colonists of those worlds

232
00:13:44.711 --> 00:13:48.310
that we once believe that.in the sky to be all that there was.

233
00:13:48.730 --> 00:13:53.260
But now we've grown and advanced metaphorically and physically and come to

234
00:13:53.261 --> 00:13:58.060
venture too.
And inhabit worlds,
which we also won saw only as dots in the sky.

235
00:13:58.450 --> 00:14:00.730
Earth will always be our home,

236
00:14:00.790 --> 00:14:05.530
but the human perspective of what constitutes the definition of the world will

237
00:14:05.531 --> 00:14:09.520
have grown incredibly.
We talked today about our global society,

238
00:14:09.521 --> 00:14:12.280
how our civilization works as one planet,

239
00:14:12.610 --> 00:14:16.360
a perspective which is radically different from the one people had 500 or so

240
00:14:16.361 --> 00:14:17.194
years ago,

241
00:14:17.560 --> 00:14:21.880
but perhaps a few hundred years in the future we may regard society and more

242
00:14:21.881 --> 00:14:26.860
than that civilization and more than that humanity as something which exists

243
00:14:26.861 --> 00:14:31.000
around the sun on many worlds,
much more intricate than what we think of today.

244
00:14:31.420 --> 00:14:33.090
I don't mean to get too off track with all this.

245
00:14:33.100 --> 00:14:37.210
I just think it's interesting to consider looking up at the sky and considering

246
00:14:37.270 --> 00:14:42.270
that civilization and people exist up there as well anyway,

247
00:14:42.430 --> 00:14:45.520
even though Maurice would technically be habitable at this point,

248
00:14:45.580 --> 00:14:47.800
other issues would nationally still remain.

249
00:14:48.370 --> 00:14:52.430
It would still probably take at least another century for the tear and marsh and

250
00:14:52.431 --> 00:14:53.930
ecosystem to fully develop.

251
00:14:54.110 --> 00:14:57.410
And we haven't even discussed the generation of a magnetosphere yet,

252
00:14:57.740 --> 00:15:00.620
which is crucial even for the most basic level of life.

253
00:15:01.190 --> 00:15:06.050
But how long would it take for Mars to look blue and green like earth?

254
00:15:06.710 --> 00:15:07.850
It's hard to say.

255
00:15:07.851 --> 00:15:11.660
Even major scientists don't have a single estimate because there are several

256
00:15:11.661 --> 00:15:16.580
different approaches to terra forming and I don't want to calculate how much

257
00:15:16.581 --> 00:15:20.480
faster future technology will make terror for me because that technology doesn't

258
00:15:20.510 --> 00:15:21.590
even exist yet.

259
00:15:21.860 --> 00:15:25.970
But I also don't think it makes much sense to assume that we won't develop new

260
00:15:25.971 --> 00:15:29.090
technology within the next few centuries.
For example,

261
00:15:29.091 --> 00:15:32.750
I remember watching something one time a long time ago with someone talking

262
00:15:32.751 --> 00:15:37.160
about how we can just move humanity to Mars and the sun becomes hotter and you

263
00:15:37.161 --> 00:15:38.390
know,
a few billion years.

264
00:15:38.720 --> 00:15:42.050
And I just thought it was shortsighted to assume that we'll still be living on a

265
00:15:42.051 --> 00:15:44.900
single planet for the next few billion years.
But anyway,

266
00:15:45.470 --> 00:15:50.470
I'd say that with full effort given we could have something like ocean starting

267
00:15:51.171 --> 00:15:56.171
to form within 100 years and maybe have an ability within 200 more years.

268
00:15:57.650 --> 00:15:59.420
Again,
that's the best estimate.

269
00:15:59.421 --> 00:16:02.510
It might take longer or future technology could make it shorter.

270
00:16:03.050 --> 00:16:06.110
No one honestly knows for sure,
but if we started today,

271
00:16:06.140 --> 00:16:11.140
I personally would put the deadline on the year 2,317 let's move on to Venus.

272
00:16:12.440 --> 00:16:15.350
As mentioned,
Venus has the opposite problem.

273
00:16:15.351 --> 00:16:19.280
The key here at first is to try to cool the planet down and reduce the pressure

274
00:16:19.281 --> 00:16:24.170
of the crushing atmosphere.
A number of methods have been proposed to do this.

275
00:16:24.860 --> 00:16:29.000
Where on Mars we suggest a giant orbiting mirrors to reflect sunlight on the

276
00:16:29.001 --> 00:16:30.380
surface.
On Venus,

277
00:16:30.381 --> 00:16:34.430
we could use giant orbiting shades to block that sunlight and cool the planet

278
00:16:34.431 --> 00:16:35.264
off that way.

279
00:16:35.930 --> 00:16:40.010
Balloons designed to reflect sunlight place in the atmosphere could also help to

280
00:16:40.011 --> 00:16:44.570
this end.
Now on Mars,
I briefly mentioned domed artificial cities.

281
00:16:44.571 --> 00:16:49.040
Basically colonists could live on the surface and giant domes like this,

282
00:16:49.250 --> 00:16:51.860
which would maintain earth conditions within,

283
00:16:52.250 --> 00:16:56.120
but on Venus it would be much harder to do that because of the external forces

284
00:16:56.870 --> 00:17:01.850
and alternative made popular by Jeffrey Landis is to build the short term

285
00:17:01.851 --> 00:17:04.630
terraforming colonies or transition colonies,

286
00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:07.100
I guess you could call them in the atmosphere.

287
00:17:07.850 --> 00:17:10.550
The surface of Venus is very inhospitable,

288
00:17:10.670 --> 00:17:14.060
but there's an area higher in the atmosphere where the temperature is actually

289
00:17:14.061 --> 00:17:17.450
kind of Nice and the atmospheric pressure isn't too bad.

290
00:17:18.080 --> 00:17:19.960
It's still toxic and not breathable.

291
00:17:19.970 --> 00:17:22.040
He wouldn't want to just wander outside in it,

292
00:17:22.041 --> 00:17:24.650
but you could probably be fine in just the space.

293
00:17:25.230 --> 00:17:29.930
Land is suggestion is to build giant cities in the atmosphere which are hoisted

294
00:17:29.931 --> 00:17:33.290
by balloons.
It seems a little far fetched,

295
00:17:33.320 --> 00:17:37.070
but it actually wouldn't be that difficult to construct because as land is

296
00:17:37.071 --> 00:17:40.550
pointed out,
the gases that we're used to on earth,

297
00:17:40.580 --> 00:17:44.630
oxygen and nitrogen would float and Venus's atmosphere anyway.

298
00:17:45.080 --> 00:17:47.630
In his words.
If you take the room that you're sitting in right now,

299
00:17:47.660 --> 00:17:50.490
seal it off and make the walls a little bit lighter,

300
00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:54.480
it would actually float in the minutia and atmosphere.
From there,

301
00:17:54.510 --> 00:17:58.050
we could use genetically engineered plants to convert the carbon dioxide into

302
00:17:58.051 --> 00:18:01.980
oxygen or probably machines which served the same purpose more efficiently.

303
00:18:02.220 --> 00:18:06.270
We would still have to reduce atmospheric density to live on the surface as
well.

304
00:18:07.170 --> 00:18:11.430
Some suggestions to meeting that goal and could bombarding Venus with hydrogen.

305
00:18:12.090 --> 00:18:14.520
This would cause something called the Bosch reaction,

306
00:18:14.521 --> 00:18:17.520
which would eventually turn carbon dioxide into graphite,

307
00:18:17.550 --> 00:18:19.860
which is what pencil lead really is,

308
00:18:20.190 --> 00:18:24.570
and water which has an added benefit because Venus needs water.

309
00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:26.251
It has some,

310
00:18:26.251 --> 00:18:30.060
but a lot of its water was lost his space over time because of solar winds and

311
00:18:30.061 --> 00:18:31.710
the lack of that magnetic field.
Again,

312
00:18:32.010 --> 00:18:35.850
something along the lines of the Bosch reaction would reduce both the pressure

313
00:18:35.851 --> 00:18:37.560
and the temperature of the atmosphere.

314
00:18:38.100 --> 00:18:42.090
It's been suggested that we could also directly or moving this his atmosphere by

315
00:18:42.091 --> 00:18:45.810
perhaps blasting it off with huge asteroid impacts or collecting it with

316
00:18:45.811 --> 00:18:49.950
machines and shooting and off the planet.
Regarding the astroid concept.

317
00:18:49.980 --> 00:18:53.910
The issue with that is mostly that Venus would likely recollect it's atmosphere

318
00:18:53.911 --> 00:18:58.110
again over time because it wouldn't be injected very far off into space.

319
00:18:58.520 --> 00:18:59.070
Furthermore,

320
00:18:59.070 --> 00:19:02.730
it would take a large number of such impacts to make a significant dent in

321
00:19:02.731 --> 00:19:07.290
Venus's atmosphere.
Secondly,
it's been suggested that we could not only,

322
00:19:07.291 --> 00:19:09.450
as I said,
artificially or move the atmosphere,

323
00:19:09.780 --> 00:19:14.430
but that we could transport Venus's CO2 to terraform Mars at the same time.

324
00:19:14.850 --> 00:19:17.970
That would take a huge amount of time and resources.
However,

325
00:19:17.971 --> 00:19:22.971
and I personally tend to regard ideas like shipping CO2 from Venus to Mars or

326
00:19:23.430 --> 00:19:27.540
water from Europa to Venus or anything that requires interplanetary exchange on

327
00:19:27.541 --> 00:19:32.250
a massive scale as out of our current or near technological limitations.

328
00:19:32.460 --> 00:19:33.570
It's possible certainly,

329
00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:38.250
but I think the best methods are the ones that are currently feasible,

330
00:19:38.610 --> 00:19:42.390
not best in a sense that it's the most effective,
but the most reliable.

331
00:19:43.140 --> 00:19:46.950
There was also the issue I mentioned of the slow rotation,
as I said,

332
00:19:47.400 --> 00:19:52.400
sunrise to sunset would last about 116 earth days and that is a bit of a

333
00:19:52.591 --> 00:19:56.700
nuisance at first.
We could overcome this artificially.

334
00:19:56.730 --> 00:20:00.630
Maybe cities could employ giant shades to create an artificial night or

335
00:20:00.631 --> 00:20:04.080
something of that nature,
but we could also speed the rotation up.

336
00:20:04.590 --> 00:20:07.620
This would be kind of dangerous so it couldn't be sloppy,

337
00:20:08.100 --> 00:20:13.050
but we could theoretically give Venus huge numbers of ashred moons which orbit

338
00:20:13.051 --> 00:20:17.010
the planet quickly over time and with more advanced methods,

339
00:20:17.011 --> 00:20:18.960
this could create a faster spin.

340
00:20:19.350 --> 00:20:23.070
Another fun fact is that Venus rotates backwards compared to the earth.

341
00:20:23.100 --> 00:20:25.800
The Sun would rise in the west and set in the east,

342
00:20:26.220 --> 00:20:30.390
but that wouldn't be obviously an issue regarding habitability.
However,

343
00:20:30.391 --> 00:20:34.200
we may want to hold off on our officially making the planet spin faster and I

344
00:20:34.201 --> 00:20:38.730
suppose we'd have to anyway because the technology required to do so is beyond

345
00:20:38.731 --> 00:20:39.564
our level.

346
00:20:39.780 --> 00:20:44.010
We'd want to hold off because a slowly rotating plant would actually be

347
00:20:44.011 --> 00:20:48.160
beneficial to the terraforming effort with Venus.
Slowly,

348
00:20:48.161 --> 00:20:52.060
it would cause large cloud formations on a sunny side of the planet to forum

349
00:20:52.090 --> 00:20:54.640
which would reflect sunlight and keep the planet cool.

350
00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:59.680
It has been hypothesized that the daytime would be rainy,
warm,
and cloudy,

351
00:20:59.920 --> 00:21:02.560
but the nighttime side would actually be pretty cold.

352
00:21:02.590 --> 00:21:06.700
Living on Venus would be a little bit like living in Alaska or Siberia,

353
00:21:07.510 --> 00:21:12.100
especially with the constant presence or lack of the sun.
At that point,

354
00:21:12.130 --> 00:21:16.300
we would repeat the same process that we use on Mars of introducing life

355
00:21:16.301 --> 00:21:19.870
graduates to the planet and creating a tear and venuzio and ecosystem.

356
00:21:20.830 --> 00:21:23.110
Because Venus is such as smooth planet,

357
00:21:23.111 --> 00:21:26.110
its surface would be about 80% covered with water,

358
00:21:26.111 --> 00:21:30.070
despite the fact that it would only take about 10% the water of earth to do that

359
00:21:30.910 --> 00:21:33.220
accordingly.
As you can see here,
artists,

360
00:21:33.221 --> 00:21:37.150
depictions of Venus often show a large amount of islands and a lot of sea.

361
00:21:37.720 --> 00:21:40.870
I'm sure you're going imagine living on Venus in a city near the coast,

362
00:21:40.900 --> 00:21:44.440
going outside on a typical,
the Newseum day,
rainy and warm,

363
00:21:45.220 --> 00:21:49.390
no moons would exist in Venus is sky and that night the stars would appear

364
00:21:49.391 --> 00:21:49.990
frozen,

365
00:21:49.990 --> 00:21:54.940
turning only very slowly as a night with last for over a hundred days from
earth.

366
00:21:54.970 --> 00:21:59.530
The Morningstar as Venus has called being the third brightest object in our sky

367
00:21:59.950 --> 00:22:02.200
would become less bright and would turn blue.

368
00:22:03.460 --> 00:22:08.110
And what about the magnetic fields of both planets?
Well,
those are currently,

369
00:22:08.111 --> 00:22:08.711
as I said,

370
00:22:08.711 --> 00:22:12.310
one of the hardest parts of terraforming to address because it's not something

371
00:22:12.311 --> 00:22:15.580
which we have,
which we have experienced fooling around with here on earth.

372
00:22:16.180 --> 00:22:20.230
It's something that we've been fortunate enough to naturally have and magnetic

373
00:22:20.231 --> 00:22:24.550
fields serves a purpose of reflecting cosmic radiation which can harm organisms

374
00:22:24.551 --> 00:22:28.270
and strip away the atmospheres of the terraform to worlds and things of that

375
00:22:28.271 --> 00:22:29.104
nature.

376
00:22:29.170 --> 00:22:32.490
Earth's magnetic field is created from molten metal and the core of the planet's

377
00:22:32.510 --> 00:22:35.770
spinning and churning inside it in Venus and Mars.

378
00:22:35.800 --> 00:22:40.060
These cores of cooled down far too much,
obviously a direct approach.

379
00:22:40.061 --> 00:22:43.990
This problem is to get the core hot again here on earth.

380
00:22:43.991 --> 00:22:47.290
The gravitational forces of our moon tug at our planet's insights,

381
00:22:47.320 --> 00:22:49.990
keeping them moving around.
Theoretically,

382
00:22:50.020 --> 00:22:53.560
the introduction of large amounts of astroid moons like I mentioned earlier with

383
00:22:53.561 --> 00:22:54.940
getting Venus has been faster,

384
00:22:55.330 --> 00:22:58.480
could also get the cores of Mars and Venus more active as well.

385
00:22:58.720 --> 00:23:02.620
We could also attempt to create nuclear explosions in the mantle or hit the

386
00:23:02.621 --> 00:23:04.510
planets with very large asteroids.

387
00:23:04.960 --> 00:23:07.950
Something that would obviously have to be done very early in the terraforming

388
00:23:08.050 --> 00:23:11.260
phases.
This approach will take time,
however,

389
00:23:11.261 --> 00:23:14.740
in technology beyond a current limits.
So in the meantime,

390
00:23:14.741 --> 00:23:18.520
the construction of some form of artificial magnetic field would probably have

391
00:23:18.521 --> 00:23:21.520
to be employed as well.
So in a nutshell,

392
00:23:21.580 --> 00:23:26.200
that's how we could terraform Mars and Venus on Mars introducing the frozen

393
00:23:26.201 --> 00:23:29.830
carbon dioxide and Marta's poles into the atmosphere and converting that

394
00:23:29.831 --> 00:23:33.790
atmosphere into a breathable one using micro organisms and other methods and

395
00:23:33.791 --> 00:23:37.300
then generating a magnetic field is essentially all it would take to terraform

396
00:23:37.301 --> 00:23:38.950
Mars for Venus,

397
00:23:38.980 --> 00:23:42.580
reducing the atmospheric density and pressure somehow by converting and are

398
00:23:42.581 --> 00:23:44.410
moving the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.

399
00:23:44.470 --> 00:23:47.900
Probably through the boss' reaction as it would give Venus much needed water

400
00:23:47.990 --> 00:23:51.390
generating the magnetic field as well and possibly one day getting the planet

401
00:23:51.391 --> 00:23:55.220
has been faster is essentially what it would take to terraform.
Venus.

402
00:23:55.850 --> 00:23:58.010
Obviously it's not entirely so simple.

403
00:23:58.011 --> 00:24:01.580
There are many other concerns and there will likely be other problems that we

404
00:24:01.581 --> 00:24:03.920
aren't even aware of yet.
Worst of all,

405
00:24:03.950 --> 00:24:08.510
we could even somehow screw up and prolong the terraforming process or even make

406
00:24:08.511 --> 00:24:11.780
a planet even more inhospitable.
However,

407
00:24:11.840 --> 00:24:15.890
those steps are the basic steps to getting the job done.
Assuredly,

408
00:24:15.920 --> 00:24:18.440
this is all easier said than done.
However,

409
00:24:18.441 --> 00:24:22.880
it's not so complex that we can't begin the process today with our current level

410
00:24:22.881 --> 00:24:23.720
of technology.

411
00:24:24.620 --> 00:24:28.400
Terraforming has always been one of my personal favorite concepts and all of

412
00:24:28.401 --> 00:24:29.540
astronomy and science.

413
00:24:29.630 --> 00:24:32.060
It's up there with extra terrestrial life and things like that.

414
00:24:32.061 --> 00:24:34.610
And when I first looked into this when I was a younger kid,

415
00:24:35.030 --> 00:24:36.860
I like many other people,

416
00:24:37.160 --> 00:24:40.400
was not satisfied with just one or two planets alone.

417
00:24:41.300 --> 00:24:45.320
Probably about 70% of the terraform in conversation is about Mars.

418
00:24:45.630 --> 00:24:48.800
Terra forming Venus is a little bit less of a popular subjects,

419
00:24:48.801 --> 00:24:52.130
but avid terror formers know that Venus is the real deal too.

420
00:24:52.430 --> 00:24:53.720
But what many people,

421
00:24:53.780 --> 00:24:57.440
including my younger self wants to know is why stopped there?

422
00:24:57.740 --> 00:25:02.690
What about mercury?
The Jovian Moons Titan,
our moon,
Luna,
or even other worlds?

423
00:25:03.050 --> 00:25:06.260
I mentioned earlier at the beginning of this video that they were unfeasible and

424
00:25:06.261 --> 00:25:09.020
I'll take some time to explain terraforming on those worlds.

425
00:25:09.021 --> 00:25:13.850
Now some people ask first of all about terraforming the sun.

426
00:25:13.910 --> 00:25:16.010
I'd say that for very obvious reasons,

427
00:25:16.011 --> 00:25:20.120
terraforming a star is out of the question and makes no sense and would

428
00:25:20.121 --> 00:25:24.230
furthermore probably cause extinction on all the other worlds in a slow system

429
00:25:24.231 --> 00:25:28.460
which could be tear formed along with the earth.
Moving on,

430
00:25:28.610 --> 00:25:33.050
gas giants,
could we tear formed Jupiter,
Saturn,
Uranus or Neptune?

431
00:25:33.770 --> 00:25:37.820
The question makes more sense,
but it's still unrealistic I guess.

432
00:25:37.821 --> 00:25:41.030
Giant has no solid surface to terraform.
Just a rocky,

433
00:25:41.031 --> 00:25:45.530
highly pressurized core surrounded by extremely thick clouds of hydrogen and

434
00:25:45.531 --> 00:25:46.364
helium.

435
00:25:46.370 --> 00:25:50.420
We could strip away the atmospheres of the gas giants had tried to work with the

436
00:25:50.421 --> 00:25:55.010
rocky core for that process is again extremely unrealistic.

437
00:25:55.011 --> 00:25:59.310
You're talking about removing like 90% of the mass of a planet 100 times or more

438
00:25:59.311 --> 00:26:00.290
of the size of the earth.

439
00:26:00.410 --> 00:26:03.230
Not to mention gas giants aren't even in the habitable zone.

440
00:26:04.010 --> 00:26:08.570
One could argue some exotic method to terraforming something like Jupiter and it

441
00:26:08.571 --> 00:26:12.650
would be a worthwhile thought experiment.
However,
here's the bottom line.

442
00:26:13.040 --> 00:26:17.060
If it would be easier and more beneficial to create artificial self sufficient

443
00:26:17.061 --> 00:26:17.950
space,
station,

444
00:26:17.951 --> 00:26:22.310
city type things in orbit around the sun or a gas giant or wherever,

445
00:26:22.550 --> 00:26:25.250
then it would be more rational to pursue something like that.

446
00:26:25.251 --> 00:26:30.251
Then something as extreme and impractical as terraforming and entire gas giant

447
00:26:30.950 --> 00:26:32.270
gas giants are out.

448
00:26:32.750 --> 00:26:36.680
I would honestly rather suggest just constructing an entirely new planet and

449
00:26:36.740 --> 00:26:39.680
terraforming Jupiter.
What about mercury?

450
00:26:40.220 --> 00:26:44.130
Mercury is interesting and that it has a gravity as strong as Mars,

451
00:26:44.460 --> 00:26:46.050
but even with no atmosphere,

452
00:26:46.051 --> 00:26:49.290
it is far too hot and atmosphere would only make this worse.

453
00:26:49.440 --> 00:26:53.850
Some bizarre method of cooling the planet and shielding it from the sun,
again,

454
00:26:53.851 --> 00:26:57.750
would be more costly than building an artificial space station to the same

455
00:26:57.751 --> 00:27:01.440
effect mercury is out.
However,

456
00:27:01.470 --> 00:27:05.670
some people have suggested what is called Para terraforming parrots.

457
00:27:05.810 --> 00:27:09.900
Terra forming is essentially the halfway between building artificial dumps it

458
00:27:09.901 --> 00:27:12.600
he's like we mentioned earlier with Mars and terraforming.

459
00:27:12.900 --> 00:27:16.980
It's essentially where giant structures which expand across an entire planet,

460
00:27:16.981 --> 00:27:21.210
or at least large portions of the planet are constructed to create an artificial

461
00:27:21.211 --> 00:27:23.220
climate to us today.

462
00:27:23.221 --> 00:27:26.910
This sounds like in circling something like mercury in a giant Shell made of

463
00:27:26.940 --> 00:27:30.240
durable,
advanced technology or something of that nature,

464
00:27:30.720 --> 00:27:32.490
but regardless of how practical this is,

465
00:27:32.491 --> 00:27:37.020
constructing such a thing on a scale of an entire planet is something well

466
00:27:37.021 --> 00:27:41.250
outside our current technological capabilities.
What about the moon?

467
00:27:41.251 --> 00:27:44.730
Also known as Luna?
Luna is,
as I said,

468
00:27:44.760 --> 00:27:48.540
too small to hold an atmosphere for very long.
At the beginning of the video,

469
00:27:48.541 --> 00:27:52.530
I counted the moon out.
It's in the habitable zone.
Obviously it's a rocky world,

470
00:27:52.800 --> 00:27:54.150
but it's just too small,

471
00:27:54.151 --> 00:27:57.120
and our efforts would be better spent working with Mars and Venus.

472
00:27:57.690 --> 00:28:01.860
It has been suggested,
however,
that there is a way to terraform it on a,

473
00:28:02.550 --> 00:28:06.570
on a cosmic scale.
Luna is not large enough to maintain an atmosphere of its own.

474
00:28:06.810 --> 00:28:09.090
However,
it could in theory,

475
00:28:09.091 --> 00:28:12.420
hold an earth like atmosphere for a span of a few thousand years,

476
00:28:12.870 --> 00:28:15.690
which is a pretty decent amount of time from the human perspective.

477
00:28:16.560 --> 00:28:20.280
Future colonists would simply have to regulate the atmosphere and replenish it

478
00:28:20.281 --> 00:28:21.270
whenever necessary.

479
00:28:21.930 --> 00:28:25.650
The process of terra forming the moon involved with bombarding it with comments

480
00:28:25.651 --> 00:28:27.420
containing a large amount of water.

481
00:28:28.110 --> 00:28:32.130
Scientists have calculated that about 100 comments is size of how he's comment

482
00:28:32.131 --> 00:28:35.310
will be sufficient to deliver necessary amounts of waters of the moon,

483
00:28:35.430 --> 00:28:39.540
build up accrued atmosphere from the impacts and even get the moon spinning as

484
00:28:39.541 --> 00:28:43.140
one day on the moon lasts about 28 earth days,
which is problematic.

485
00:28:43.680 --> 00:28:45.600
Obviously this would have to be precise.

486
00:28:45.630 --> 00:28:48.660
We would definitely not want to be throwing comments around and screwing with an

487
00:28:48.661 --> 00:28:50.970
object so close to home.
From there,

488
00:28:50.971 --> 00:28:53.610
when the surface settles from having been bombarded heavily,

489
00:28:53.820 --> 00:28:57.930
more precise conversion of the atmosphere will begin life both natural and

490
00:28:57.931 --> 00:29:01.800
probably more so genetically engineered would be introduced to Luna and in

491
00:29:01.801 --> 00:29:06.300
theory we could turn the gray object we see in the sky into a blue and green
one.

492
00:29:07.500 --> 00:29:10.860
This doesn't solve the problem of the very low gravity,
however,

493
00:29:10.861 --> 00:29:14.550
which wouldn't be an issue for short term visitors but would be for permanent

494
00:29:14.551 --> 00:29:18.600
residence.
The combination of an earth lag atmosphere in such low gravity,

495
00:29:18.630 --> 00:29:21.960
however,
would lead to some very interesting possibilities.

496
00:29:22.470 --> 00:29:26.760
A human being could essentially strap on a pair of fake wings and actually fly

497
00:29:26.761 --> 00:29:28.770
through the hypothetical atmosphere of our moon.

498
00:29:28.950 --> 00:29:31.470
This is already possible on Saturn's moon titan.

499
00:29:31.830 --> 00:29:33.600
If we aren't able to get the moon spinning.

500
00:29:33.600 --> 00:29:37.200
Daytime and nighttime maybe very complicated and uncomfortable,

501
00:29:37.350 --> 00:29:40.950
and the moon as well has no magnetic field to defend against solar.

502
00:29:41.830 --> 00:29:45.730
Some have suggested that we simply resolve this by living in the moon's caves.

503
00:29:45.731 --> 00:29:49.990
However,
why bother with the rest of the moon?
If we're restricted to the caves,

504
00:29:50.050 --> 00:29:52.450
we'd have to generate an artificial magnetic field.

505
00:29:52.630 --> 00:29:55.240
I'm not saying terraforming Luna is impossible.

506
00:29:55.270 --> 00:29:57.940
There are a number of good theories surrounding terra forming it,

507
00:29:57.941 --> 00:30:01.930
but for now we should leave it as a maybe just because it's more complex and

508
00:30:01.931 --> 00:30:05.200
Martha Venus and somewhat out of our technological capabilities.

509
00:30:05.890 --> 00:30:10.540
What about Jupiter's unknowns,
Europa,
Ganymede,
Calista and io?
Well,

510
00:30:10.541 --> 00:30:14.050
first things first,
we have the same issue of very low gravity,
again,

511
00:30:14.140 --> 00:30:17.200
lower than the moon.
In fact.
Secondly,

512
00:30:17.201 --> 00:30:19.280
these moons are outside the huddle zone,

513
00:30:19.281 --> 00:30:22.810
so we would have to create a greenhouse effect which can cope with much lower

514
00:30:22.811 --> 00:30:26.920
sunlight.
Now,
Europa specifically here is in my opinion,

515
00:30:26.950 --> 00:30:30.070
the best candidate to find alien life and the source system.

516
00:30:30.071 --> 00:30:34.000
It may even have multicellular organisms swimming in the ocean which exists

517
00:30:34.001 --> 00:30:37.860
under it thick shell of ice.
If life that complex exists there,

518
00:30:37.861 --> 00:30:41.170
terraform in the world could disrupted.
Secondly,

519
00:30:41.171 --> 00:30:43.030
Europa has a lot of water,

520
00:30:43.090 --> 00:30:45.910
a lot more water than even earth actually in terra forming.

521
00:30:45.911 --> 00:30:50.290
It would essentially create a giant ocean world with no surface to colonize.

522
00:30:50.980 --> 00:30:55.270
This obviously would make terraforming and colonization,
incredibly implausible,

523
00:30:55.300 --> 00:30:57.940
and this is a case for Ganymede and Calista as well.

524
00:30:58.540 --> 00:31:02.440
Io is simply extremely volatile as our each of the moons around Jupiter,

525
00:31:02.500 --> 00:31:04.540
because of their orbit around the giant planet,

526
00:31:04.870 --> 00:31:07.840
the Jovian moons are out because they are impractical.

527
00:31:08.260 --> 00:31:11.650
We furthermore see a very similar problem with Saturn's moon titan.

528
00:31:11.980 --> 00:31:14.740
Even if we dealt with how far titan is from the sun,

529
00:31:14.770 --> 00:31:18.850
we'd still end up with an ocean world and conditions that are not at all ideal

530
00:31:18.851 --> 00:31:21.850
for terraforming and longterm human habitability.

531
00:31:22.330 --> 00:31:24.670
And the farther away from the sun you get from there,

532
00:31:24.671 --> 00:31:26.830
the more impractical terraform and becomes,

533
00:31:27.100 --> 00:31:30.730
the more impractical the terraforming becomes.
The more exotic you have to get,

534
00:31:30.910 --> 00:31:32.350
the more exotic you have to get,

535
00:31:32.351 --> 00:31:35.740
the more you have to invest into it and the more you have to invest into it,

536
00:31:35.890 --> 00:31:40.300
the greater the incentive is to just build artificial space stations or dome

537
00:31:40.301 --> 00:31:43.180
cities or even pair terra formed type structures.

538
00:31:43.630 --> 00:31:47.500
Mars and Venus having been the stars of this video are obviously our best

539
00:31:47.501 --> 00:31:51.010
candidates.
The moon is a possibility.
Mercury,

540
00:31:51.040 --> 00:31:55.480
the gas giants and their moons and the rest of the solar system are not very

541
00:31:55.481 --> 00:32:00.280
feasible.
As humanity would move out to colonize the entire solar system,

542
00:32:00.281 --> 00:32:03.280
founding bases,
towns and cities from mercury to Pluto.

543
00:32:03.460 --> 00:32:07.870
We would have Mars and Venus as a symbols of our optimism and determination and

544
00:32:07.871 --> 00:32:11.530
our expansion into the rest of the galaxy where we may find other earth like

545
00:32:11.531 --> 00:32:13.600
world's possibly extra terrestrial life forms.

546
00:32:13.930 --> 00:32:17.560
But my guess would be that we will find many more worlds in need of some terra

547
00:32:17.561 --> 00:32:19.540
forming than there are already habitable.

548
00:32:19.960 --> 00:32:24.010
What we would be doing in our solar system would be the first steps to creating

549
00:32:24.011 --> 00:32:28.000
scores of re-engineered world's throughout the galaxy on which we may spread the

550
00:32:28.001 --> 00:32:32.770
great variety of earth life and allow it to diversify and limitless new ways.

551
00:32:33.130 --> 00:32:38.130
We've discussed when we have discussed how but who would do this and why anyone

552
00:32:39.020 --> 00:32:42.320
paying attention to the modern space programs throughout the world knows is that

553
00:32:42.321 --> 00:32:44.360
there isn't much to pay attention to.

554
00:32:44.750 --> 00:32:49.280
Governments are simply not interested in space.
However,

555
00:32:49.310 --> 00:32:52.790
private individuals and organizations are smart enough to be,

556
00:32:53.960 --> 00:32:56.930
it's an uphill battle to convince the public to fund a space program.

557
00:32:56.931 --> 00:33:00.740
Average people tend to look down on things that don't put bread on the table or

558
00:33:00.741 --> 00:33:02.690
a gas in the car as the expression goes,

559
00:33:03.050 --> 00:33:07.430
so I personally do not put huge faith and world governments or popular demand to

560
00:33:07.431 --> 00:33:10.040
begin a tariff on processes.
In fact,
in my opinion,

561
00:33:10.041 --> 00:33:14.360
the biggest problem in terraforming would be securing long term support Merith.

562
00:33:14.660 --> 00:33:19.460
I think therefore the terraforming of Mars and Venus would be left in the hands

563
00:33:19.461 --> 00:33:21.110
of the people who plant lives there.

564
00:33:21.111 --> 00:33:25.760
The handful of visionaries who are capable of seeing where our civilization has

565
00:33:25.761 --> 00:33:30.260
headed,
that the average person is not capable of.
Why should we do it?

566
00:33:30.740 --> 00:33:31.071
Well,

567
00:33:31.071 --> 00:33:35.390
there are a number of benefits to having not one but three inhabited worlds in

568
00:33:35.391 --> 00:33:36.141
our solar system.

569
00:33:36.141 --> 00:33:39.680
The most important is that we are better securing the future of earth,
life,

570
00:33:39.681 --> 00:33:41.600
and humanity for billions of years.

571
00:33:41.900 --> 00:33:45.980
If something catastrophic were to happen to one of the three planets to others

572
00:33:45.981 --> 00:33:49.970
would continue on.
Furthermore,
even if humans were to disappear,

573
00:33:50.180 --> 00:33:54.110
life on Venus and Mars could take its own path and evolve in new ways.

574
00:33:54.111 --> 00:33:58.250
In our absence,
of course,
to increase our odds of survival for much longer,

575
00:33:58.251 --> 00:34:00.440
we'd have to leave the solar system altogether.

576
00:34:01.190 --> 00:34:04.550
There would of course be large amounts of people who objected,
terraforming,

577
00:34:04.551 --> 00:34:07.640
which is why I don't think we should even bother leaving the decision in the

578
00:34:07.641 --> 00:34:08.930
hands of the populous at home.

579
00:34:09.350 --> 00:34:12.020
We should leave it in the hands of the pioneers in themselves.

580
00:34:12.410 --> 00:34:15.980
This may mean that it won't be similar to having something like American,

581
00:34:15.981 --> 00:34:18.950
British,
Chinese,
French,
etc. Colonies on Mars or Venus,

582
00:34:19.430 --> 00:34:22.820
but we may see that the settlers just found their own societies right off the

583
00:34:22.821 --> 00:34:23.420
bat.

584
00:34:23.420 --> 00:34:27.080
They would likely mix earth culture and ways of life as they adapt and create a

585
00:34:27.081 --> 00:34:29.450
new culture based on the planet on which they live.

586
00:34:30.230 --> 00:34:34.040
I think it would be interesting to see the kinds of ways people adapt socially,

587
00:34:34.041 --> 00:34:35.870
culturally,
and politically to new planets.

588
00:34:36.080 --> 00:34:39.530
Would they speak earth languages or create new languages to unify those

589
00:34:39.531 --> 00:34:42.230
societies?
How would they adapt new calendars?

590
00:34:42.350 --> 00:34:45.950
I'm Marcia near last twice as long as there's so would you wait twice as long

591
00:34:45.951 --> 00:34:47.960
for a birthday or have it twice a year?

592
00:34:48.270 --> 00:34:51.110
Could war break out between societies on different planets?

593
00:34:51.350 --> 00:34:53.810
Would there be much reason for interplanetary war?

594
00:34:53.930 --> 00:34:56.900
How would life in general respond to being on new planets?

595
00:34:57.170 --> 00:35:01.000
How will life evolve and new conditions such as a long days and nights on Venus,

596
00:35:01.010 --> 00:35:04.520
much closer to the sun or the much lower gravity on Mars?

597
00:35:05.120 --> 00:35:08.570
These are all very interesting questions that we should spend time thinking

598
00:35:08.571 --> 00:35:13.571
about and often may criticism of venturing off into space is that we have an

599
00:35:13.731 --> 00:35:18.530
obligation to fix our world at home before we go off into the cosmos.
However,

600
00:35:18.770 --> 00:35:21.710
though mistakes were made in our history of exploring earth,

601
00:35:22.040 --> 00:35:24.590
exploration has always made us a better people.

602
00:35:24.591 --> 00:35:28.490
And I would say that the societies which go out and explore and settle new

603
00:35:28.491 --> 00:35:33.050
worlds develop much more than those which sit around and focus on domestic

604
00:35:33.051 --> 00:35:34.280
problems that may exist.

605
00:35:34.281 --> 00:35:38.060
And definitely for more videos like this and videos on many other subjects,
