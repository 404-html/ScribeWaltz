Scientists have known for years that liquid water existed on Mars in its ancient

2
00:00:04.951 --> 00:00:09.630
past and it's even been observed but exist in its liquid form in the modern day

3
00:00:09.631 --> 00:00:11.430
from your hours on the surface of Mars.

4
00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.660
But soon NASA may announced and his spent large amounts of liquid water that

5
00:00:15.661 --> 00:00:19.890
exists seasonally and marched for longer,
but still short periods of time.

6
00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.340
Many have often speculated that this is the case.

7
00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.190
Maurice has a large amount of water only.
It's mostly frozen.

8
00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:30.210
We're scientists had just discovered that this is not always the case.

9
00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:32.970
The Mars reconnaissance orbiter,

10
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.600
according to the team as discover that seasonal dark streets appearing on the

11
00:00:36.601 --> 00:00:41.601
surface of Mars can be attributed to surface water appearing periodically and

12
00:00:41.971 --> 00:00:46.971
Marge is warm season until it eventually is lost to the atmosphere or this

13
00:00:47.341 --> 00:00:47.910
reason.

14
00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.200
Many suspects that the report will evolve around liquid water on Mars and are

15
00:00:52.201 --> 00:00:55.530
anxiously awaiting.
The reason,
of course,

16
00:00:55.531 --> 00:00:57.900
that's just so exciting is that on earth water,

17
00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.870
organic molecules and an energy source equals life.

18
00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.540
Many believe that in a similar environment,

19
00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.380
the same is true across the university and many believe Mars would be the first

20
00:01:07.381 --> 00:01:09.570
candidate for exploring these hypotheses,

21
00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.790
especially if liquid water does exist there.

22
00:01:11.791 --> 00:01:16.140
As we hope the team will announce tomorrow if this discovery does eventually

23
00:01:16.141 --> 00:01:16.830
lead to life,

24
00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.560
and if the life can be proven to have not originated from Earth billions of

25
00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:22.470
years ago and have been transported there,

26
00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:25.830
it will fundamentally change all of science in human thing.

27
00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:30.540
This discovery may indeed for shadow the discovery of alien life,

28
00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:35.400
and that discovery may lead to a finding of life across the solar system on

29
00:01:35.401 --> 00:01:40.300
Europa and sell it as titan and many other worlds and eventually across the

30
00:01:40.301 --> 00:01:41.134
entire universe.

31
00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:45.550
Many questions would of course be brought up such as where does all this water

32
00:01:45.551 --> 00:01:49.180
originates?
However,
tomorrow at 1130 eastern standard time,

33
00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:53.500
these questions and much more hopefully be explained by Nassis team

34
00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.600
to follow updates on these amazing,

35
00:01:56.601 --> 00:02:00.260
this federal reason for more videos in playlists on astrobiology astronomy,

36
00:02:00.261 --> 00:02:04.960
science in general,
and many other topics,
I invite you to check out fire.

37
00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:07.010
Thank you for watching.
