00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.440
Hello and welcome the fire of learning known as the British bulldog,

2
00:00:04.441 --> 00:00:09.441
Sir Winston Leonard Spencer Churchill born in 1874 and died 1965 was a British

3
00:00:11.101 --> 00:00:16.050
soldier and politician best recognized for his first term as prime minister

4
00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:18.000
during the Second World War,

5
00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.800
while a controversial figure to be sure he remains one of the most notable

6
00:00:22.801 --> 00:00:27.150
figures of the 20th century as he oversaw the demise of the British empire,

7
00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.980
but helped save Britain along with much of the world from the grip of fascism.

8
00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:36.660
In this video,
we'll discuss 10 tips from Churchill that led to his achievements.

9
00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:41.010
Number 10 attitude is a little thing that makes it big difference.

10
00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:45.960
Church hill oversaw and participated in a large number of events in British

11
00:00:45.961 --> 00:00:48.180
history.
He fought in three wars,

12
00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.550
was a political figure in world war one and was prime minister who World War Two

13
00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.910
and the early stage of the Cold War.
His ability to get not only himself,

14
00:00:56.911 --> 00:01:01.200
but help his nation get through these things rested and keeping a positive and

15
00:01:01.201 --> 00:01:05.820
strong attitude where many others would falter even in the face of devastation.

16
00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:07.320
Number nine,

17
00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:12.270
the best argument against democracy is a five minute conversation with the

18
00:01:12.271 --> 00:01:13.170
average voter.

19
00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:17.520
While this quote can be taken as an insult toward the common people,

20
00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.770
it can also be seen as a warning.

21
00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.950
Many leaders of Democracies reiterate that an intelligent and informed populace

22
00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.230
is the key to a functioning democracy.

23
00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:32.610
If the populists disregards politics and education in general,

24
00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:37.640
then this may lead some to dean them unfit to rule and some figures may take

25
00:01:37.921 --> 00:01:41.700
advantage of their obliviousness and assume more power over them until the

26
00:01:41.701 --> 00:01:45.510
democracy itself is overturned.
Number Eight,
study history.

27
00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:50.600
Study history and history lies all the secrets of statecraft very often in

28
00:01:51.691 --> 00:01:52.141
history,

29
00:01:52.141 --> 00:01:57.060
receipted same mistakes made over and over in my video finding our place in the

30
00:01:57.061 --> 00:01:57.630
universe.

31
00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.440
I discussed the fact that history is more than just a record of what happened in

32
00:02:01.441 --> 00:02:05.010
the past within it our lessons and warnings for the future,

33
00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.250
not only for statecraft but for any field,

34
00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:12.420
and that is why is to study those who've come before you.
Number seven,

35
00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:15.510
courage is what it takes to stand up and speak.

36
00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:19.320
Courage is also what it takes to sit down and listen.

37
00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:23.850
Very often in our lives,
we may feel that we know what is best,

38
00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:27.060
they know what must be done,
we have all the answers,
et Cetera,

39
00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.310
but sometimes we really did not.

40
00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:33.900
The ability to consider that we may be wrong about something is an important
one,

41
00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:38.310
and it may be hard to do for most everyone because no one wants to be wrong,

42
00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:42.180
but we shouldn't feel as though being open to what others have to bring to the

43
00:02:42.181 --> 00:02:45.630
table is damaging to our ego.
That is very dangerous.

44
00:02:45.631 --> 00:02:50.520
And Churchill who warned of coming war with the Nazis as early as a twenties to

45
00:02:50.521 --> 00:02:53.100
our British government that did not adequately listen.

46
00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:58.200
It has a four right to make the statement.
Number six,
you have enemies good.

47
00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:01.420
That means you must have stood up for something sometime in your life.

48
00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:04.510
This quote is sometimes attributed to Mnm,

49
00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:07.030
but it came in fact from Churchill.

50
00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:11.290
There comes a time in your life when you have to develop principals and the sons

51
00:03:11.291 --> 00:03:15.400
of integrity and inevitably there was a time when you may have to defend and

52
00:03:15.401 --> 00:03:19.480
debate those principles.
Now,
of course with reference to the last quote,

53
00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:21.430
the open to what others have to say,

54
00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:24.190
but don't surrender yourself for the sake of peace either,

55
00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:28.090
especially if what you're standing up for is not merely your principles but

56
00:03:28.091 --> 00:03:28.870
yourself.

57
00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:33.820
Churchill also said an appeaser is one who feeds a crocodile hoping it will eat

58
00:03:33.821 --> 00:03:38.140
him.
Last number five.
Criticism may not be agreeable,

59
00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:43.030
but it is necessary.
It fulfills the same function as pain in the human body.

60
00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:46.000
It calls attention to an unhealthy state of things.

61
00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:49.210
This quote is similar to number seven but distinct.

62
00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:52.720
If we go through life unwilling to stand any criticism,

63
00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:55.690
then we essentially view ourselves as perfect.

64
00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:59.680
If we do not be ourselves as perfect and admit we have problems,

65
00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:05.130
then criticism is a very valuable way to find ways to address our problems as

66
00:04:05.471 --> 00:04:10.210
other people often have a perspective that we lack in ourselves.
Now,

67
00:04:10.211 --> 00:04:14.380
of course there is a line where constructive criticism ends and you may have to

68
00:04:14.381 --> 00:04:19.060
refer to quote number six when it does go too far,
but the rest of the time,

69
00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:23.680
criticism is merely advice with a sting to it.
Number four,

70
00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:27.310
success is not final.
Failure is not fatal.

71
00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:30.100
It is the courage to continue that counts.

72
00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:33.970
This quote makes sense with regard to Churchill's life.

73
00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:38.830
He witnessed the end of world war one only to have to contend with the second

74
00:04:38.831 --> 00:04:43.330
world war later in life and after there was success in ending the Second World

75
00:04:43.331 --> 00:04:43.900
War.

76
00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:48.820
It was not final because almost immediately the world was gripped by the fear of

77
00:04:48.821 --> 00:04:52.480
a Third World War.
As the cold war began,
despite Churchill,

78
00:04:52.481 --> 00:04:56.770
success is towards peace.
None of them were ever final,
but on the flip side,

79
00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:00.640
what Churchill failed in life never stopped them from trying again.

80
00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:04.120
No matter what he continued.
Number three,

81
00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:07.750
history will be kind to me for I intend to write it.

82
00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:12.040
One of the things that made Churchill who he was was his intention to

83
00:05:12.041 --> 00:05:15.340
participate in life,
not the stick back and watch it happen.

84
00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:21.160
Churchill through his actions did in fact write history and a very important

85
00:05:21.341 --> 00:05:26.200
history of that.
He did not allow history to take him.
Number two,

86
00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:28.750
we make a living by what we get,

87
00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:33.190
but we make a life by what we give hill through.

88
00:05:33.191 --> 00:05:37.750
This quote highlights his belief that what we give to the world is what makes us

89
00:05:37.751 --> 00:05:41.040
who we are in his position.
Churchill,

90
00:05:41.041 --> 00:05:45.310
his actions were not always that great.
As I said,
he is a controversial figure,

91
00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:48.370
but there are may things which he supported and did,

92
00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:53.170
which were for the benefit of mankind and those types of actions are what we

93
00:05:53.171 --> 00:05:56.530
should focus on in our lives.
Number one,

94
00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:01.190
if you're going through hell,
keep going.
This can be seen as immoral,

95
00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:03.380
iconic wave saying quote number four,

96
00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:07.340
but it strikes home a little bit more in our lives.

97
00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:10.850
We have faced some very great hardships in Churchill's life.

98
00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.330
He faced some very great hardships as well,
no matter what.

99
00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:17.210
Even when it seemed as if he were going through hell.

100
00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:20.930
He kept going and he told his nation to keep going through the words,

101
00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:24.170
we shall defend our island,
whatever the cost may be,

102
00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:27.650
we shall fight on the beaches.
We shall fight on the landing grounds.

103
00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:31.670
We shall fight in the fields and in the streets.
We shall fight in the hills.

104
00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:36.020
We shall never surrender,
and that is essential to Churchill's personality.

105
00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:38.810
Churchill,
of course,
had a lot more to say,

106
00:06:38.811 --> 00:06:42.410
but these were some of his best quotes.
Now at this time,

107
00:06:42.411 --> 00:06:44.450
I'd like to thank our first patron support,

108
00:06:44.451 --> 00:06:46.910
a Chris Yates for his donations of fire and learning,

109
00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:51.200
and of course his donation amount gets him the opportunity to choose an upcoming

110
00:06:51.201 --> 00:06:52.970
video.
As promised,
Chris,

111
00:06:52.971 --> 00:06:56.750
your donation will be used to further the channel to support the creation of

112
00:06:56.751 --> 00:07:00.260
videos like these.
A link to that patriotic we found in a description.

113
00:07:00.290 --> 00:07:03.590
For more videos like this and video is on many other subjects be should have

114
00:07:03.591 --> 00:07:06.860
take out fire of learning and subscribe.
Thank you for watching.
