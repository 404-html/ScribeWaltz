00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.350
Hello and welcome to fire of learning Rome and China,

2
00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:09.240
two of the ancient world's greatest civilizations though contemporaries,

3
00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:13.590
these two cultures existed isolated from each other on opposite sides of the

4
00:00:13.591 --> 00:00:18.480
world in between them,
mountains,
deserts,
forests,
rivers,

5
00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:21.210
and numerous other peoples and language barriers.

6
00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.260
In a world where transportation was primitive and the hypothetical journey from

7
00:00:25.261 --> 00:00:29.430
Rome to China or vice versa could have taken months or even longer.

8
00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.870
Despite this distance,
it seems fascinating to ask,

9
00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:38.670
did the Romans and Chinese know of each other?
If so,
what contact,

10
00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.780
if any,
did they have with each other and if they were in contact,

11
00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.100
what does this mean for their history and all of world history?
Well,

12
00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:49.020
here today on fire,
I'm learning.

13
00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.560
We will be answering these questions and more so let's get to it.

14
00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:03.990
Before we begin,
I would like to thank sound wizard,
Pamela and Mork,
Jeff Smith,

15
00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:08.760
Jonathan Yansen or Jensen and Michael would for being our most recent supporters

16
00:01:08.761 --> 00:01:09.660
on patriotic.

17
00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.750
They join these supporters listed here who helped make these videos possible now

18
00:01:14.791 --> 00:01:18.810
than Rome and China.
A good place to start with.

19
00:01:18.811 --> 00:01:21.480
This question is about the second century BC.

20
00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:26.160
It is around this time that we see both Rome and China are large,
powerful,

21
00:01:26.161 --> 00:01:29.340
influential empires,
not by coincidence.

22
00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.810
It is in this time that we see the emergence of something called the Silk Road.

23
00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.300
The Silk Road,
as you can probably guess,

24
00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:38.520
it doesn't refer to an actual single road.

25
00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.320
It's a name for a number of trade routes extending all the way from eastern Asia

26
00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.530
where China ruled to the Mediterranean where Rome ruled.

27
00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:51.780
The name comes from the most lucrative objects to travel along this route.
Silk.

28
00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.820
Those silk would be found all across this route.
It was made solely in China.

29
00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.230
It's production being a closely guarded secret because of how important it was

30
00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:04.260
to Chinese wells along the Silk Road.

31
00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:08.460
Many other objects moved back and forth as well.
Spices,
metals,

32
00:02:08.461 --> 00:02:11.220
precious stones,
wine,
ivory,
cotton,

33
00:02:11.221 --> 00:02:15.960
glassware and other things as well like knowledge,
ideas,
technology,

34
00:02:15.961 --> 00:02:18.450
culture,
and unfortunately disease.

35
00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:23.330
This was not the first time long distance trade had ever occurred.

36
00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:27.200
There is some evidence that Chinese cell committed it's way west from centuries

37
00:02:27.201 --> 00:02:28.070
prior even,

38
00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:32.270
but the growth of these two empires made trade much more common and profitable.

39
00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:37.220
Did Chinese silk end up in Rome?
Did Roman coins end up in China?

40
00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:39.950
Absolutely.
Roman coins,
for example,

41
00:02:39.951 --> 00:02:44.720
have even been found in places like Vietnam and Japan.
This tells us that yes,

42
00:02:44.721 --> 00:02:49.721
the Chinese and Romans did have at least indirect contact and we're at least

43
00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:52.220
superficially aware of each other.

44
00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:56.720
China knew that there must have been a great power far to the West and Rome

45
00:02:56.721 --> 00:03:00.850
likewise knew the same about the far east and that it was from these mysterious

46
00:03:00.851 --> 00:03:04.390
places that goods went to and came from.
However,

47
00:03:04.391 --> 00:03:06.730
this doesn't tell us everything we need to know.

48
00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:12.100
The term is silk road is an invention by historians.
In recent centuries,

49
00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:16.540
very few people would have actually gone the whole distance from western Europe

50
00:03:16.541 --> 00:03:20.940
to China as there wouldn't have been much reason to at least economically
anyway.

51
00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:25.590
Most traders moved goods from one city to another neighboring one and then

52
00:03:25.591 --> 00:03:29.280
traders there would move the goods to another city and so on and so forth.

53
00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:34.470
Basically with the civilizations of the Near East and South Asia functioning as

54
00:03:34.471 --> 00:03:39.030
middlemen.
We have to wonder though if at some point a Roman looked at the,

55
00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:42.480
made in China tag on his silk and asked,
what is China?

56
00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:46.710
Did the two civilizations ever come to know more about each other?

57
00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:51.250
You could safely guests that the common Roman or the common Chinese person could

58
00:03:51.251 --> 00:03:54.900
have gotten their whole lives without knowing about the other or wondering much

59
00:03:54.901 --> 00:03:57.300
about it.
But the leaders,
scholars,

60
00:03:57.301 --> 00:04:01.830
and merchants of these nations absolutely did know about each other and there is

61
00:04:01.831 --> 00:04:05.130
evidence of direct contact on multiple occasions.

62
00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:10.200
The Romans called China,
either steady [inaudible],
the land of silk or Sienna,

63
00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:13.740
a word,
basically with the same root as the word China.

64
00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:18.810
A number of Roman historians such as virtual and Ptolemy wrote about China,

65
00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:22.830
although many Romans seemed to be less certain about where exactly it was and

66
00:04:22.831 --> 00:04:27.720
some even confused it with other nations and this reconstruction of a Roman map,

67
00:04:27.721 --> 00:04:32.070
we can see that they weren't always far off though likewise,

68
00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:34.770
the Chinese referred to Rome as dot chain,

69
00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:39.890
meaning the other China for the Chinese to equate Rome to themselves as a clear

70
00:04:40.551 --> 00:04:42.470
sign that they were respected by them.

71
00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:46.820
And Rome seems to fit into the ancient Chinese conception of the world as being

72
00:04:46.821 --> 00:04:50.240
the other great empire on the other side of the world.

73
00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:53.300
The Chinese were also aware of the ancient Greeks,

74
00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:58.220
especially as Alexander's Empire stretched even further east than Rome ever did

75
00:04:58.550 --> 00:04:58.881
hear.

76
00:04:58.881 --> 00:05:03.881
Even is a Chinese depiction of a blue wide Greek soldier and above him a center

77
00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:09.140
of figure of Greek mythology from around the time of Alexander the Chinese

78
00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:13.640
correctly believe that Rome was the successor to the Greek states of the east.

79
00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:18.890
Historians have found a number of records clearly describing events of direct

80
00:05:18.891 --> 00:05:19.610
contact.

81
00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:24.140
That is to say Romans visiting China and the Chinese visiting Rome.

82
00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:28.760
These accounts range from explorer is venturing into the unknown to intentional

83
00:05:28.761 --> 00:05:33.761
voyages by merchants and ambassadors and insights are even given into the trade

84
00:05:33.861 --> 00:05:37.430
and resources of the other nation that governments,
ways of life,

85
00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:41.270
physical descriptions of the terrain,
physical descriptions of the people,

86
00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:45.410
descriptions of the cities,
and much more,
not always accurate.

87
00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:50.330
Some accounts included fantastical legends,
but important all the same.

88
00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:55.220
The first recorded incident of the Chinese visiting Rome took place during the

89
00:05:55.221 --> 00:06:00.221
reign of the emperor Augustus when the Roman empire was becoming a true empire.

90
00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:04.310
Though this incident may have been more mercantile in nature then diplomatic.

91
00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:09.870
The first clear example of Rome reaching China seems to be later on and he

92
00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:14.960
[inaudible] the Chinese recorded people from the West arriving to their country

93
00:06:14.961 --> 00:06:17.210
and claiming to serve a rule there named Andre.

94
00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:22.630
Andre won most likely refers to Marcus or alias Antoninus.

95
00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:26.990
This incident occurred around the time that trade between Roman China began to

96
00:06:26.991 --> 00:06:31.760
pick up and historians consider the second century Aidy as the beginning of

97
00:06:31.761 --> 00:06:35.390
clear established Roman Chinese relations.

98
00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:36.980
So yes,

99
00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:41.510
Roman China not only knew of each other's existence and bits and pieces about

100
00:06:41.511 --> 00:06:43.850
each other,
but in the second century,

101
00:06:43.851 --> 00:06:48.620
a d pad established relations and from time to time visited each other.

102
00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:53.420
Trade was the driving force behind these two nations,
meaning each other.

103
00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:57.620
People were simply following the goods and wanted to know more about where they

104
00:06:57.621 --> 00:06:58.880
went to and came from.

105
00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:02.240
And contact and knowledge only became more and more common.

106
00:07:02.241 --> 00:07:06.350
As the centuries progressed.
However,
the Persians,

107
00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:08.810
the powerful middleman between Roman China,

108
00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:13.100
we're uncomfortable with the two powers interacting directly and discouraged it

109
00:07:13.101 --> 00:07:14.390
on multiple occasions.

110
00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:18.110
Even going so far as to block trade routes to prevent interaction.

111
00:07:18.410 --> 00:07:21.770
The simple reason was how much money they were making simply by being in the

112
00:07:21.771 --> 00:07:26.030
middle of the Silk Road.
It would have been difficult to actually bypass Persia,

113
00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:29.300
but if Roman China were to work something out excluding,

114
00:07:29.301 --> 00:07:30.950
it would have been bad news for them.

115
00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:35.630
Persia and the states which would arise in the region we now call Iran would act

116
00:07:35.631 --> 00:07:39.500
as the main middleman between Roman China right up until the fall of the eastern

117
00:07:39.501 --> 00:07:44.480
Roman empire in 1453 while interest in trade would have accounted for the vast

118
00:07:44.481 --> 00:07:48.020
majority of reasons to interact was that all that came down to,

119
00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:52.280
I mean certainly much more was going on and if we could hear the stories of

120
00:07:52.281 --> 00:07:55.460
these explorers and merchants,
they would undoubtedly be fascinating,

121
00:07:55.640 --> 00:07:59.930
but some story seem to believe there were even more complex interactions,

122
00:08:00.020 --> 00:08:04.970
possibly even intermarriage and warfare regarding warfare.

123
00:08:05.060 --> 00:08:08.480
While there was certainly never a war between Rome and China,

124
00:08:08.660 --> 00:08:12.980
some historians have speculated that Roman soldier is captured in the battle of

125
00:08:12.981 --> 00:08:13.701
car high.

126
00:08:13.701 --> 00:08:18.701
Around 53 BC made their way eastward as Persian slaves where they later were put

127
00:08:19.821 --> 00:08:24.050
into the service of the Xiong.
New Armies fighting against the Chinese.

128
00:08:24.590 --> 00:08:28.520
Chinese sources indicate that some foreign soldiers fighting in the battle of

129
00:08:28.521 --> 00:08:31.820
Gog formed a strange fish scale formation,

130
00:08:32.030 --> 00:08:35.990
possibly the infamous Roman testudo formation historian,

131
00:08:35.991 --> 00:08:40.520
homer h dubs even went on to suggest that these soldiers later settled in

132
00:08:40.521 --> 00:08:41.360
eastern Asia.

133
00:08:41.420 --> 00:08:45.140
Though historical and genetic evidence is less supportive of this having

134
00:08:45.141 --> 00:08:47.780
occurred and the foreign soldiers at Gigi,

135
00:08:47.781 --> 00:08:51.360
we're uncertain to have been Romans some suggests that they were Greek

136
00:08:51.361 --> 00:08:53.330
descendants of Alexander's empire,

137
00:08:53.390 --> 00:08:56.850
but they may not have been Europeans or in near easterners at all.

138
00:08:57.180 --> 00:09:01.170
We of course have to mention as well both the huns who moved into Europe around

139
00:09:01.171 --> 00:09:02.130
the fourth century,

140
00:09:02.131 --> 00:09:07.131
a d and the Mongols who moved into eastern Europe and the Near East and the

141
00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:08.100
Middle Ages.

142
00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:13.100
Neither of these groups were Chinese historians aren't 100% sure where the huns

143
00:09:13.501 --> 00:09:17.130
came from,
likely Central Asia,
but possibly farther east.

144
00:09:17.370 --> 00:09:21.060
And the mangoes of course came from the north of China and Modern Day Mongolia.

145
00:09:21.330 --> 00:09:25.440
However,
focusing on the larger picture of Western and eastern contact,

146
00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:29.850
both groups were affected by an effected to the larger politics of the day in

147
00:09:29.851 --> 00:09:34.770
both empires,
especially the Mongols,
the Hanuk invasions of Europe,

148
00:09:34.771 --> 00:09:38.940
who were possibly influenced by migrations that began by being pushed west by

149
00:09:38.941 --> 00:09:43.350
China and likely heavily influenced the future dramatic barbarian migrations

150
00:09:43.410 --> 00:09:47.160
that led to the fall of the western Roman Empire.
But ironically,

151
00:09:47.220 --> 00:09:52.080
the Mongols who conquered China likely played a role in prolonging the life of

152
00:09:52.081 --> 00:09:56.550
the Roman Empire at the time known to Westerners as the Byzantine Empire by

153
00:09:56.551 --> 00:09:58.050
invading their rivals.

154
00:09:58.380 --> 00:10:02.790
Exploring the relations between these ancient civilizations gives us a very

155
00:10:02.791 --> 00:10:06.690
important insight into what the perspectives and lives of past people's were

156
00:10:06.691 --> 00:10:10.920
like an important insight into how human civilization as a whole developed.

157
00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:15.480
It was a time when the world was nowhere near as connected as it is today,

158
00:10:15.510 --> 00:10:19.350
but not as far apart as we might've assumed.
As I said,
however,

159
00:10:19.380 --> 00:10:23.460
it is a great shame that perhaps the greatest stories of Romans in China or

160
00:10:23.461 --> 00:10:26.100
Chinese and Rome maybe lost forever.

161
00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:30.660
Some of you may remember the media talking about the Chinese skeletons having

162
00:10:30.661 --> 00:10:35.170
been discovered in Britain dating back to Roman Times while the claim that these

163
00:10:35.171 --> 00:10:38.580
skeletons are Chinese was based on very bad evidence,

164
00:10:38.850 --> 00:10:43.500
such things were not impossible and it's interesting to consider how these

165
00:10:43.501 --> 00:10:48.210
things may have played out.
I hope you enjoyed this video.
