Hello and welcome to fire of learning.
If you're a regular viewer of my channel,

2
00:00:04.351 --> 00:00:08.670
you've probably heard it be reiterated a few times by now that Columbus was not

3
00:00:08.671 --> 00:00:12.270
the first confirmed person from the old world to reach the Americas.

4
00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.550
It was the vikings.
However,

5
00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:18.750
what I haven't talked about as frequently are some speculations about people

6
00:00:18.751 --> 00:00:22.500
that may have made it to the Americas in between Columbus and the vikings or

7
00:00:22.501 --> 00:00:26.820
even before the Vikings and today I want to talk about one such theory.

8
00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.560
Is it possible that I'll need decades before Columbus reached the Americas,

9
00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.990
the Chinese landed in the same area.

10
00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:37.020
This might sound like a conspiracy theory,

11
00:00:37.021 --> 00:00:40.110
but there's actually an interesting amount of debate over the subject which we

12
00:00:40.111 --> 00:00:43.110
are going to explore today.
So as I said,

13
00:00:43.111 --> 00:00:46.860
there are multiple claims of people reaching a new world from the old world or

14
00:00:46.861 --> 00:00:49.020
even vice versa before Columbus.

15
00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.990
I will look at a number of these claims in the future.

16
00:00:51.991 --> 00:00:54.240
I might even dedicate a whole video to some of them,

17
00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.190
but the theory with China region,

18
00:00:56.191 --> 00:01:00.090
the Americas stands out among them because it's something that was completely

19
00:01:00.091 --> 00:01:03.570
possible for the Chinese civilization at the time to have accomplished.

20
00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.470
The main theory which we're seeking to prove or disprove was made popular by the

21
00:01:07.471 --> 00:01:12.471
book written by Gavin Menzies called 1421 the year China discovered America.

22
00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:15.060
1421 is of course,

23
00:01:15.061 --> 00:01:18.180
71 years before Columbus landed in the Caribbean.

24
00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.550
So before we explore this claim,

25
00:01:20.551 --> 00:01:25.530
let's look at what was going on in Shyna slightly before 1421 and early 15th

26
00:01:25.531 --> 00:01:28.860
century China,
the Ming Dynasty was beginning to take root in the country.

27
00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:32.760
It was replacing the yuan dynasty,
which was a remnant of the Mongolian empire.

28
00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:35.550
The young Lee emperor whose name was Judy,

29
00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:38.280
wanted to expand China's raisins in a manner of speaking,

30
00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.020
and he did much of this militarily.

31
00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.350
He firstly kind of reconstructed the Great Wall of China,

32
00:01:43.351 --> 00:01:45.600
but then turned his attention to China's naval power.

33
00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:50.310
The main aspect of this naval buildup was what is referred to as the treasure

34
00:01:50.311 --> 00:01:53.190
fleet,
which will be sent on the treasure voyages.

35
00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:56.370
Leading the treasure fleet was Admiral Jang,
Huh,

36
00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.300
who was Chinese but was raised a Muslim and was brought into the Chinese

37
00:02:00.301 --> 00:02:01.260
imperial courts.

38
00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:05.940
The purpose of this expedition was not merely curiosity or anything like that.

39
00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:09.900
There was a clear intent with the treasure fleet to lay the grounds for China's

40
00:02:09.901 --> 00:02:13.470
expansion into what the emperor envisioned as a kind of superpower,

41
00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.190
which is very relevant to the question of potential Chinese discovery of the

42
00:02:17.191 --> 00:02:19.620
Americas.
The Chinese,
we're not screwing around.

43
00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:23.460
To further demonstrate that China had complete potential to have discovered the

44
00:02:23.461 --> 00:02:24.294
Americas.

45
00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:28.950
Here is a comparison between one of Columbus's ships and one of Jang has ships.

46
00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:32.460
Columbus commanded 88 men and three ships is young,

47
00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:36.240
has commanded about 28,000 men on 300 ships.

48
00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:38.610
China was basically on par,

49
00:02:38.611 --> 00:02:42.540
if not ahead of Europe technologically specifically with regard to navigational

50
00:02:42.541 --> 00:02:44.730
technology and understanding and such things.

51
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.380
These ships carried food to last for years and even if they began to run out,

52
00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:52.200
had soil on the ships for the purpose of growing more.

53
00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:56.280
They had weaponry and horses is fleet had the potential to sail around the whole

54
00:02:56.281 --> 00:02:59.980
world and fight battles and such things along the way and fight battles.

55
00:02:59.981 --> 00:03:04.330
The fleet did in fact do.
The purpose of the treasure voyages,
as I said,

56
00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:06.820
was not arbitrary or undefined.

57
00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:11.740
The Chinese wanted to not only expand commerce,

58
00:03:11.741 --> 00:03:12.790
but to dominate it.

59
00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:15.870
They not only wanted to open diplomatic relations with other people,

60
00:03:15.871 --> 00:03:18.940
that's what they wanted to establish a Gemini over them.
Essentially,

61
00:03:18.941 --> 00:03:22.510
they want it to assert Chinese dominance and authority across the world.

62
00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:26.400
They would flaunt their wealth and power through the gifts that they brought for

63
00:03:26.401 --> 00:03:29.770
unreal has,
but what also quite forcefully demand tribute from them as well.

64
00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:33.370
If you are the ruler of a small kingdom which they visited,

65
00:03:33.371 --> 00:03:37.060
you would not want these people knocking on your door because with the backbone

66
00:03:37.061 --> 00:03:38.770
that they had from this massive fleet,

67
00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:44.160
resisting their demands was not an easy option between 1405 and 1433 young.

68
00:03:45.781 --> 00:03:50.110
How would lead seven expeditions across the world with these intentions laid out

69
00:03:50.111 --> 00:03:54.610
to him by the emperor.
Here is a map of those voyages.
As you can see,

70
00:03:54.611 --> 00:03:58.420
the fleet spent most of their time in Asia and Indonesia and India and things

71
00:03:58.421 --> 00:04:02.110
like that,
but also voyage the Middle East where it's worth mentioning.

72
00:04:02.111 --> 00:04:05.740
Junge [inaudible] was able to make his pilgrimage to Mecca and even went along

73
00:04:05.741 --> 00:04:09.670
the coast of east Africa,
possibly as far south as Mozambique.

74
00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:13.240
That is what is agreed upon officially by historians.

75
00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:15.490
There's plenty of evidence to believe this much.

76
00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:17.800
Some historians like Gavin Menzies,
however,

77
00:04:17.801 --> 00:04:22.420
claim that he kept going past Mozambique,
reaching West Africa,
the Americas,

78
00:04:22.421 --> 00:04:26.500
Australia,
and finishing it off with having circumnavigated the whole planet.

79
00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:31.060
The farther he has claimed to have gone.
However,
the weaker that the evidence is,

80
00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:32.710
but what evidence is there?

81
00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:37.450
Menzies claims that the Chinese sailed around Africa and then reach South

82
00:04:37.451 --> 00:04:41.710
America and the Caribbean then swung around to places like modern Ahla where the

83
00:04:41.711 --> 00:04:46.660
ink and empire was and Modern Day California messy theory is not the only one

84
00:04:46.661 --> 00:04:47.740
worth talking about.
However,

85
00:04:47.741 --> 00:04:51.820
and we will consider the notion of China's simply sailing eastward to California

86
00:04:51.821 --> 00:04:52.331
and Mexico.

87
00:04:52.331 --> 00:04:57.331
In that Matt evidence initially rested on the record that Europeans did not say

88
00:04:57.401 --> 00:05:00.070
a blindly into the unknown when they traveled westward.

89
00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:03.940
They were going off maps which unfortunately no longer exist,

90
00:05:03.941 --> 00:05:06.430
which may have outlined certain parts of the Americas.

91
00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:10.720
Menzies originally believed that these maps were made by Portuguese explorers

92
00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:14.710
but soon found this to not be true what the rest of Europe,
the Muslim world,

93
00:05:14.711 --> 00:05:17.440
Africa and such places being unlikely candidates.

94
00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:21.250
He concluded that the maps must've been Chinese and correlated them to this

95
00:05:21.251 --> 00:05:24.220
magnificent treasure voyage which occurred at a similar time.

96
00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:28.450
Menzies Theory is reinforced by certain archeological finds,

97
00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:32.650
certain artifacts found in north and South America like jewelry,

98
00:05:32.651 --> 00:05:34.540
beads are pieces,
coins,

99
00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:38.890
etc. Resemble those which would be consistent with the Chinese at a time.

100
00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:43.360
However,
no artifacts are a significant enough for a confirmation.

101
00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:48.250
Some artifacts which are surely Chinese have been shown to originate from a much

102
00:05:48.251 --> 00:05:52.480
later time such as the palace Verdes stones discovered in California.

103
00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:56.500
Their discovery led some to question if the Chinese had not been here long

104
00:05:56.501 --> 00:06:01.340
before 1421 believing that the came from around the year 500 however they have

105
00:06:01.341 --> 00:06:02.600
been shown to come from.

106
00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:06.500
Actually it turns out the 18 hundreds some artifacts from this time period

107
00:06:06.501 --> 00:06:10.220
cannot be confirmed to be Chinese or at least even influenced by the Chinese

108
00:06:10.221 --> 00:06:14.600
such as drawings of what you might interpret as horses made by native tribes in

109
00:06:14.601 --> 00:06:16.070
Peru from around this time period,

110
00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:19.970
which the Chinese would have almost definitely exposed native Americans do had

111
00:06:19.971 --> 00:06:22.460
they truly landed on the continent.
However,

112
00:06:22.461 --> 00:06:27.461
the animals in question are ambiguous and very likely not actually horses.

113
00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:32.630
Beyond this,
the evidence is actually very weak.
As you can see,

114
00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:37.070
there are no artifacts which pointed definite contact between the Chinese and

115
00:06:37.071 --> 00:06:41.090
native Americans in the 15th century.
As for the maps which I mentioned,

116
00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:44.120
many are vague and none confirmed the hypotheses.

117
00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:48.410
Most historians are not convinced and some even accused of maps of being

118
00:06:48.411 --> 00:06:51.140
forgeries which were created to support Menzies theory.

119
00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:54.770
Gavin Menzies then goes off the deep end with his theory,

120
00:06:54.771 --> 00:06:57.350
despite the lack of evidence for even the core of it,

121
00:06:57.830 --> 00:07:02.180
claiming that the Incan empire was ruled by Chinese military officials and that

122
00:07:02.181 --> 00:07:03.350
Moctezuma the second,

123
00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:08.000
the famous ruler of the Aztec Empire was actually Chinese and believe that when

124
00:07:08.001 --> 00:07:12.620
Cortez landed in the Americas,
it was his grandfather making a return.

125
00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:14.600
There is no evidence for this.

126
00:07:14.601 --> 00:07:18.710
It makes no sense and thus there's no reason to believe it.
However,

127
00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:23.780
that little fantasy doesn't negate all possibility that the Chinese landed in

128
00:07:23.781 --> 00:07:24.980
the America is altogether.

129
00:07:25.190 --> 00:07:29.720
Yet historians still need the very major issue of the fact that there is not

130
00:07:29.721 --> 00:07:30.710
evidence as a port.

131
00:07:30.711 --> 00:07:34.790
This settled especially because in their view there most definitely should be.

132
00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:38.600
The signs of European influence in the Americas from the beginning are very

133
00:07:38.601 --> 00:07:39.290
blatant.

134
00:07:39.290 --> 00:07:43.340
The Vikings who landed in the Americas at least 400 years before the Chinese

135
00:07:43.341 --> 00:07:47.330
here are purport to have still left obvious remnants of their voyages and

136
00:07:47.331 --> 00:07:49.070
presence that we can still find today.

137
00:07:49.250 --> 00:07:53.240
It is recorded in both native folklore and Viking history and you can actually

138
00:07:53.241 --> 00:07:57.770
go to Canada and find all kinds of evidence that the vikings were indeed there

139
00:07:57.890 --> 00:08:00.900
even if for only a short time.
Furthermore,

140
00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:04.760
it's worth considering the issue of the lack of the crosspollination that

141
00:08:04.761 --> 00:08:08.660
occurred when Europeans rich is saying that if society is that the Chinese are

142
00:08:08.661 --> 00:08:11.570
said to have reached things like corn and tomatoes,

143
00:08:11.571 --> 00:08:15.020
gold and silver and all kinds of things that the natives had would have been as

144
00:08:15.021 --> 00:08:19.490
interesting to the Chinese as it was to the Europeans and the things the Chinese

145
00:08:19.491 --> 00:08:22.250
would've had would've been as interesting to the natives as a thing so that the

146
00:08:22.251 --> 00:08:27.251
Europeans had this transfer of resources and things did not take place,

147
00:08:27.321 --> 00:08:30.710
at least on the scale that it did between Europeans and native Americans.

148
00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:34.970
There are not only not any confirmed Chinese artifacts in the Americas,

149
00:08:34.971 --> 00:08:38.900
but there are no records of Aztec gold or native American corn making their way

150
00:08:38.901 --> 00:08:39.734
to China.

151
00:08:40.070 --> 00:08:44.540
This seems to rule out the notion that the Chinese were active in the Americas

152
00:08:44.541 --> 00:08:47.270
or even had a major interest in it.
However,

153
00:08:47.271 --> 00:08:51.380
it still doesn't completely negate the possibility of Chinese discovery of the

154
00:08:51.381 --> 00:08:52.214
Americas.

155
00:08:52.460 --> 00:08:56.970
Remember that I said that the treasure fleets objective to expand China's power

156
00:08:56.971 --> 00:08:58.470
and influence throughout the world,

157
00:08:59.130 --> 00:09:03.150
it is possible that the Chinese perhaps landed in California or Chile or

158
00:09:03.151 --> 00:09:06.030
somewhere like that,
but found the native populations.

159
00:09:06.031 --> 00:09:10.860
It'd be two unremarkable to really focus on,
they already considered Indians,

160
00:09:10.861 --> 00:09:14.310
Arabs,
Africans,
and Europeans to be inferior.
Barbarian People's,

161
00:09:14.340 --> 00:09:18.000
even though they were civilized and thus one could conclude that they would have

162
00:09:18.001 --> 00:09:22.470
thought less of the tribes of the new world who were and their view much less or

163
00:09:22.471 --> 00:09:23.430
would have been in their view,

164
00:09:23.431 --> 00:09:27.330
much less civilized and they have thus disregarded them.

165
00:09:28.140 --> 00:09:32.070
However,
this is merely postulation.
Now,
evidence supports this possibility,

166
00:09:32.580 --> 00:09:36.390
so it shouldn't affect that there is not much evidence to support this theory.

167
00:09:36.391 --> 00:09:39.840
Be The nail in the coffin for it.
Well,
not exactly.

168
00:09:40.350 --> 00:09:44.920
It's worth pointing out that a lot of the treader voyage and itself was lost to

169
00:09:44.921 --> 00:09:48.480
history because the rulers which came after this time intentionally erased a

170
00:09:48.481 --> 00:09:49.800
significant amount of it.

171
00:09:50.580 --> 00:09:54.360
Why the Chinese abandoned their expansionist mentality.

172
00:09:54.750 --> 00:09:58.590
They viewed barbarian forerunners with hostility and saw no purpose and

173
00:09:58.591 --> 00:10:00.000
exploring the world any further,

174
00:10:00.300 --> 00:10:04.110
preferring to focus on the domestic affairs with China and isolate themselves as

175
00:10:04.111 --> 00:10:04.944
much as possible.

176
00:10:05.490 --> 00:10:09.150
This being the case not only where the records of the treasure voyages a race,

177
00:10:09.151 --> 00:10:12.780
but much less emphasis was placed on Chinese naval power because it was

178
00:10:12.781 --> 00:10:17.070
unnecessary in their view.
Thus diminishing the opportunity for more voyages.

179
00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:22.410
China had very few enemies over the sea and had only header tube and invaded

180
00:10:22.411 --> 00:10:23.244
over the land.

181
00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:27.900
Thus a navy or a strong navy at least was seen as unnecessary by the Chinese

182
00:10:27.901 --> 00:10:32.220
government for quite a long time.
Actually,
many of the remnants from this age,

183
00:10:32.221 --> 00:10:36.150
we're only accidentally discovered in the 1930s and the story is still being

184
00:10:36.151 --> 00:10:39.330
pieced together because the story is still being pieced together.

185
00:10:39.331 --> 00:10:42.720
Some historians still hold that the possibility of Chinese discovery of the

186
00:10:42.721 --> 00:10:46.470
Americas is somewhere waiting to be found.
However,
as of yet,

187
00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:50.460
both evidence and logical analysis of the events that we know for sure took

188
00:10:50.461 --> 00:10:52.710
place.
Lead the answer to the question,

189
00:10:52.770 --> 00:10:57.630
did the Chinese has covered the American's before Columbus as probably not and

190
00:10:57.631 --> 00:11:02.310
even if they did this with only likely amounts of being a footnote in history,

191
00:11:02.580 --> 00:11:05.130
bragging rights for the Chinese to say that they were the first.

192
00:11:05.131 --> 00:11:09.060
I suppose you could say there's even less reason to believe that there was a

193
00:11:09.061 --> 00:11:13.260
major impact from the discovery if it even took place.
Nevertheless,

194
00:11:13.290 --> 00:11:17.130
we can still definitely imagine a scenario in which a Chinese not only

195
00:11:17.131 --> 00:11:21.690
discovered the Americas but pursued their expansionist mentality they had in the

196
00:11:21.691 --> 00:11:26.070
15th century the complete capability to give birth to a global empire.

197
00:11:26.100 --> 00:11:28.590
Similar to the ones which are the Europeans constructed.

198
00:11:29.340 --> 00:11:33.480
What if the Chinese had discovered the Americas and began colonies in the area?

199
00:11:33.750 --> 00:11:38.220
How would this have changed?
World history,
the 18th century,
the 19th century,

200
00:11:38.221 --> 00:11:40.680
the world wars,
the Cold War,
the modern day.

201
00:11:41.220 --> 00:11:45.420
It's interesting to consider the possibilities of this alternative history.

202
00:11:45.690 --> 00:11:49.800
I imagine this would have led to east versus West conflict very early on and the

203
00:11:49.801 --> 00:11:50.221
Americas,

204
00:11:50.221 --> 00:11:54.760
perhaps a war between Spain and China in the modern western United States and

205
00:11:54.761 --> 00:11:58.780
perhaps later across the world,
given the Chinese hostility to foreigners,

206
00:11:58.781 --> 00:12:01.720
I doubt the native Americans would have been dealt with better hand in this

207
00:12:01.721 --> 00:12:05.230
alternate timeline.
However,
as for our history,

208
00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:09.340
the likelihood is very slim that the Chinese made it to the American's before

209
00:12:09.341 --> 00:12:12.700
Columbus.
However,
definitely worth exploring.

210
00:12:14.110 --> 00:12:15.460
I hope you enjoyed this video.

I'll probably make a video talking about the Patriots specifically soon.

219
00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:50.560
Mostly because I'm still working with it and I would appreciate absolutely your

220

guys' input on the subject,
but for now,
that's all I wanted to say.
