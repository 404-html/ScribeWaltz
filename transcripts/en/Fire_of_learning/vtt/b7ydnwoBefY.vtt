00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:03.450
Hello and welcome the fire of learning the future.

2
00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:06.780
No one can truly predict what is to come,

3
00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:11.130
but we can make some educated guesses and today that's what we're going to do

4
00:00:11.131 --> 00:00:16.131
and looking at what Europe might look like in the year 2025 keep in mind,

5
00:00:16.381 --> 00:00:20.910
as always,
I keep my political,
religious and social views out of my videos.

6
00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.560
These predictions are what might happen based off analysis of what's going on

7
00:00:25.561 --> 00:00:29.760
now,
not necessarily what I want or do not want to happen now.

8
00:00:29.761 --> 00:00:33.990
Then let's get to it.
First up,
let's look at potential border changes.

9
00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.950
If you see my video,
the 25 independence movements of Europe,

10
00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.420
you know about the many regions of Europe containing calls for independence.

11
00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.090
Such calls are perhaps the loudest and the UK,

12
00:00:45.091 --> 00:00:50.040
Spain and Italy where Scotland may again pursue independence from the UK along

13
00:00:50.041 --> 00:00:54.480
with Catalonia and the Basque regions.
Pursuits of separation from Spain,
Italy,

14
00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:59.250
maybe facing complete fragmentation as not only does Benito in the northeast of

15
00:00:59.251 --> 00:01:00.900
the country desire independence,

16
00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.220
but many in the north and south favor separating from each other and even many

17
00:01:05.221 --> 00:01:06.660
on the island of Sardinia.

18
00:01:06.661 --> 00:01:10.740
Find the idea of separation favorable all the while in the east,

19
00:01:10.741 --> 00:01:15.060
some regions are essentially functioning independently already such as northern

20
00:01:15.061 --> 00:01:18.690
Cyprus,
Transnistria,
and Kosovo.
However,

21
00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.160
the independence and right to sovereignty of each of these places remains hotly

22
00:01:23.161 --> 00:01:23.850
debated.

23
00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:28.850
It's possible that in 2025 each of these nations may be independent or each of

24
00:01:29.491 --> 00:01:33.600
them may be absorbed and their independence movement snuffed out as far as

25
00:01:33.601 --> 00:01:36.870
border tensions between already independent nations go.

26
00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.400
The most tense in Europe is Ukraine and Russia as the bait over Crimea and

27
00:01:41.401 --> 00:01:42.300
eastern Ukraine.

28
00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.710
In 2014 following a Crimean referendum to join Russia,

29
00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:51.780
Russia annex the Crimean Peninsula.
While it remains under Russian control,

30
00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:56.460
many nations in the international community do not recognize it and demand

31
00:01:56.461 --> 00:01:57.540
Russia return it.

32
00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.640
The future of Crimea as well as the heavily Pro-russian Donbass region of

33
00:02:02.641 --> 00:02:04.980
Ukraine remains uncertain,

34
00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:10.110
but it's possible Russia might retain a territory in the future and now for the

35
00:02:10.111 --> 00:02:11.340
demographics of Europe,

36
00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:15.210
you have likely heard frequently of the threats of overpopulation,

37
00:02:15.211 --> 00:02:18.090
which our planet is facing.
However,
in Europe,

38
00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:23.150
the population is actually facing natural decline from low fertility rates.

39
00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:24.900
As you can see on this map,

40
00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:30.080
the highest birth rates are in France at 1.96 children per mother and the lowest

41
00:02:30.901 --> 00:02:35.901
is in Bosnia at 1.28 the fertility rate and necessary to replace a population in

42
00:02:37.021 --> 00:02:40.950
developed nations is about two children per mother.
Just to keep in mind,

43
00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:43.140
the populations of Europe,
however,

44
00:02:43.141 --> 00:02:48.120
are actually increasing because of immigration primarily from Africa and the

45
00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:48.330
Middle East.

46
00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:53.330
It's likely that up to 6.3% of the population of the European Union was born

47
00:02:53.551 --> 00:02:54.780
somewhere outside of it.

48
00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:59.590
Debate rages heavily as to whether or not immigration is beneficial or harmful

49
00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:00.250
to Europe,

50
00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:04.480
but it's likely that though there will be a mix of responses to the issue,

51
00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:08.770
the native born population will continue to decline and the foreign born

52
00:03:08.771 --> 00:03:13.630
population will continue to rise throughout the year 2025 religion,

53
00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:18.100
while three fourths of Europe remains Christian.
If current trends continue,

54
00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:22.570
there will be a rise in Erie,
religiosity,
agnosticism and atheism.

55
00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:25.990
As of today,
the Czech Republic,
Sweden,
France,

56
00:03:25.991 --> 00:03:30.370
and the Netherlands are home to the highest number of atheists and the continent

57
00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:34.090
comprising one third of these nations with higher numbers,

58
00:03:34.091 --> 00:03:36.970
still believing in some sort of God or spiritual forests,

59
00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.680
but turning away from Christianity and on top of that many Christians on the

60
00:03:41.681 --> 00:03:46.600
continent state that religion is not greatly important to their daily lives.

61
00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:50.980
Some correlate this rise with a breakdown of tradition and morality,

62
00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:54.340
others with a rise and scientific understanding.
Likewise,

63
00:03:54.341 --> 00:03:58.150
there is the bait as to whether or not this is a positive or negative change.

64
00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:00.430
The largest growing religion in Europe,
however,

65
00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:03.400
correlating with the rise in immigration is Islam,

66
00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:08.490
where perhaps 6% of the population or 44 million people are Islamic and this

67
00:04:09.221 --> 00:04:14.221
trend will likely continue and increase into 2025 the European Union with the UK

68
00:04:16.151 --> 00:04:21.151
voting to leave the European Union in 2019 Brexit may encourage other nations to

69
00:04:21.941 --> 00:04:22.774
leave as well.

70
00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:27.850
Dislike of the EU seems to be the strongest in nations like Hungary,
Latvia,

71
00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:32.290
Greece,
France,
and Spain.
Vote trouble may lie ahead for the EU.

72
00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:37.270
Reforms may encourage some members to stay and even other nonmembers to join

73
00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:40.390
such as many of the nations in the Balkans and Turkey.

74
00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:44.290
What the EU will look like in 2025 remains uncertain.

75
00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:49.180
Science and technology there will likely continue to be a considerable increase

76
00:04:49.181 --> 00:04:50.980
in fields like health and medicine,

77
00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:55.390
alternative energy and computers and robotics and transportation and years to

78
00:04:55.391 --> 00:04:58.960
come.
Diseases like dementia type one diabetes,

79
00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:04.020
AIDS and cancer may decline with new forms of treatment and understanding about

80
00:05:04.031 --> 00:05:08.350
these diseases.
Solar and wind power will likely become more prevalent.

81
00:05:08.351 --> 00:05:12.280
As many European nations have already made goals to implement these energy

82
00:05:12.281 --> 00:05:15.370
sources to combat climate change.
With Germany,

83
00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:18.640
lean away in both solar and wind power on the continent,

84
00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:23.160
electric and automated cars will likely begin to become more commonplace.

85
00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:27.820
With companies like Tesla being responsible for such technology already being on

86
00:05:27.821 --> 00:05:29.740
the road,
the use of cash will life.

87
00:05:29.741 --> 00:05:32.560
You start to give way to electronic forms of payment.

88
00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:35.530
Artificial intelligence will likely become more intelligent,

89
00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:40.180
continuing on a path toward equaling our own intelligence and much,
much more.

90
00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:43.660
Though,
as I said,
these predictions are educated guesses.

91
00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:46.030
No one for sure knows what has to come,

92
00:05:46.031 --> 00:05:50.110
and ultimately the future depends on our decisions and the present.

93
00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:54.850
Is there anything else you expect Europe to see by the year 2025 let me know in

94
00:05:54.851 --> 00:05:56.020
the comments section below.

95
00:05:56.230 --> 00:06:00.490
For more videos like this and videos on many other subjects from terraforming to

96
00:06:00.491 --> 00:06:02.560
history to dreams,
to philosophy,

97
00:06:02.561 --> 00:06:05.470
I'd invite you to check out fire of learning and subscribe.

98
00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:06.670
Thank you for watching.
