00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.100
Hello and welcome to fire of learning.

2
00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:06.240
Perhaps the big question which seems to follow the bigger question of are there

3
00:00:06.241 --> 00:00:09.090
others out there in the universe is if so,

4
00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.350
what are they like the discovery and study of not just extraterrestrial life,

5
00:00:13.351 --> 00:00:16.770
but an extraterrestrial civilization would be one of the greatest moments in

6
00:00:16.771 --> 00:00:20.190
human history.
We have a great interest in understanding such things,

7
00:00:20.191 --> 00:00:23.130
not just how aliens would look or what they're made of,

8
00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.270
but how they might think what their culture,
philosophies,
values,

9
00:00:27.271 --> 00:00:30.180
politics is silo,
organization,
technology and science.

10
00:00:30.181 --> 00:00:32.550
The progression of those fields,
history,
et Cetera,

11
00:00:32.551 --> 00:00:36.570
are if they even view those things in a similar way that we do such a study

12
00:00:36.571 --> 00:00:40.440
would just be inherently extremely interesting.
But of course furthermore,

13
00:00:40.441 --> 00:00:44.910
it would provide a very important insight into ourselves to truly understand

14
00:00:44.911 --> 00:00:47.310
that uniqueness and intricacy,
that human intelligence,

15
00:00:47.311 --> 00:00:51.630
perhaps it has to be compared to a non human intelligence due to the great

16
00:00:51.631 --> 00:00:55.410
likelihood that unless the Youtube clickbait conspiracies are actually

17
00:00:55.411 --> 00:01:00.330
substantial alien civilizations are likely light years from us.
For the moment.

18
00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:02.310
We are only guessing at these things,

19
00:01:02.311 --> 00:01:06.240
but our understanding of science has grown and we're left to use logic to make

20
00:01:06.241 --> 00:01:10.500
those guesses educated,
which is an important step in science in this video.

21
00:01:10.501 --> 00:01:13.770
By examining the mini courses evolution has taken on our planet,

22
00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:16.770
discussing known conditions on other worlds considered to be potentially

23
00:01:16.771 --> 00:01:17.550
habitable,

24
00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:21.420
and by attempting to analyze our civilization as objectively as possible,

25
00:01:21.421 --> 00:01:25.680
we can form some pretty reasonable hypotheses about what these aliens might be

26
00:01:25.681 --> 00:01:26.580
like after all,

27
00:01:26.581 --> 00:01:30.570
and we'll create a few fictional worlds to fit these aliens into to get a better

28
00:01:30.571 --> 00:01:34.620
picture of the dynamic in which they might exist.
So let's get to it.

29
00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:37.890
Let's weed out some unlikelihood here.
First,

30
00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.280
aliens are Asya Phi favorite for obvious reasons.

31
00:01:41.281 --> 00:01:45.210
They've been depicted in a number of ways on a big spectrum from unrecognizable

32
00:01:45.211 --> 00:01:48.390
monsters to just humans with wrinkly noses.

33
00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:53.330
Contrary to 95% of the races on shows and movies like star Trek and star wars.

34
00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.990
Aliens will most certainly not look like awkward humans mixing like Spock's

35
00:01:57.991 --> 00:02:02.991
human mother and alien father did is basically almost certainly an impossibility

36
00:02:03.031 --> 00:02:05.790
and probably not an attractive prospect anyway.

37
00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:10.230
And most of all they will not be speaking American English their very first day

38
00:02:10.231 --> 00:02:11.940
if they even talk at all.

39
00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:16.320
So cross out weird versions of earth regarding alien civilizations.

40
00:02:16.321 --> 00:02:20.040
Any beings we encounter will likely to be significantly different from us.

41
00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:23.610
How different though?
Well,
they have any recognizable features.

42
00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:25.560
Some astrobiologists say no.

43
00:02:25.561 --> 00:02:28.770
Any aliens we encounter will be entirely different from us with no shared

44
00:02:28.771 --> 00:02:31.560
features like eyes by Pete Elysium hands,
et cetera.

45
00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:35.580
I unlike those astrobiologist have not forgotten though that convergent

46
00:02:35.581 --> 00:02:38.400
evolution as a thing.
Humans,
of course,

47
00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:42.510
look the way we look at the way we act,
think the way we think,
et Cetera,

48
00:02:42.511 --> 00:02:44.910
because of very specific line of evolution,

49
00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:47.520
not just our hominid or primate ancestors,

50
00:02:47.521 --> 00:02:51.690
but our broader mammal and and long before that had traits that stuck with us

51
00:02:51.691 --> 00:02:54.180
that might evolve differently on other worlds,

52
00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:59.250
especially if the conditions on that world a greatly different take human eyes,

53
00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.130
for example,
our eyes and those are,

54
00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:06.010
most of our mammo relatives are attuned to the light that they are the visible

55
00:03:06.011 --> 00:03:09.610
spectrum because it was beneficial to our ancestor survival.

56
00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:13.990
Not all animals on our planet see the same way though.
Bees for example,

57
00:03:13.991 --> 00:03:18.490
see ultraviolet radiation and snakes and infrared,
it's likely that most aliens,

58
00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:21.670
if they can see,
may see the world somewhat differently than we do,

59
00:03:21.671 --> 00:03:24.820
especially if they're an environmental conditions are very much different.

60
00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:27.340
I do think that most aliens will be able to see though,

61
00:03:27.341 --> 00:03:30.100
and I'll get back to why I think that as a case later.
For now,

62
00:03:30.101 --> 00:03:34.060
let's take a fictional world that we'll call novus orbiting a red dwarf star.

63
00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:39.250
Red Dwarf Stars constitute about 85% of the stars in our galaxy and make up to

64
00:03:39.251 --> 00:03:43.900
50 of the 60 closest stars to us.
They're quiet and they live a long time,

65
00:03:43.901 --> 00:03:47.680
much longer than our stars,
opposed to live,
possibly trillions of years.

66
00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:49.750
Given these circumstances,

67
00:03:49.751 --> 00:03:54.160
we might one day meet someone from a plant around such a nice little star.

68
00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:57.940
Novus isn't a planet though.
It's a moon and you plan it around.

69
00:03:57.941 --> 00:03:59.530
This star has a reduced,
nope.

70
00:03:59.531 --> 00:04:03.640
Still completely possible chance of developing life being what is called tidally

71
00:04:03.641 --> 00:04:07.720
locked.
This means that one side of the planet faces a star at all times.

72
00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:12.790
A planet around such a star would have one side of the planet baked constantly

73
00:04:12.791 --> 00:04:16.540
in heat,
likely uninhabitable.
Most organisms,
as we understand them,

74
00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:20.320
the other side and less heat from the hot side makes its way to the cold side.

75
00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:21.760
Maybe too cold.

76
00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:25.780
This would restrict life to a ring around a planet in which a star is

77
00:04:25.781 --> 00:04:29.170
impermanent twilight,
but Novus,
which orbits?
It's gas giant.

78
00:04:29.171 --> 00:04:32.740
Once every five days has a day.
Night cycle does fixing this issue.

79
00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:37.090
Novus is also rocky has two great oceans,
polls,
et Cetera,

80
00:04:37.091 --> 00:04:38.830
but that doesn't mean it's just like home.

81
00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:41.510
The atmosphere is somewhat different than the arresting.

82
00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:43.720
The gravity is only 70% that Everest,

83
00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:45.940
but the atmospheric pressure is about the same.

84
00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:49.900
The days and nights are of course longer and the sky is red and in the day with

85
00:04:49.901 --> 00:04:54.520
a host star,
it's dimmer here and accordingly the plant life is thick and black.

86
00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:58.840
How would an alien civilization evolve here?
Well,
for starters,

87
00:04:58.841 --> 00:05:03.190
it would probably see in infrared vision our visible spectrum not being ideal

88
00:05:03.191 --> 00:05:04.900
for surviving on this kind of world.

89
00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:09.310
Having a thicker atmosphere and lower gravity organisms here could not only get

90
00:05:09.311 --> 00:05:12.820
bigger than on earth,
but in fact have a much easier time flying,

91
00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:16.630
which is exactly what the intelligent aliens on the brink of civilization here

92
00:05:16.631 --> 00:05:17.560
are capable of doing.

93
00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:21.610
Their ancestors lived in colonies and the trees being pack hunters,

94
00:05:21.611 --> 00:05:24.370
but they're rapidly changing conditions on their world has caused them to come

95
00:05:24.371 --> 00:05:26.710
down to the ground developing,
walking legs.

96
00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:28.810
Those still supporting themselves as well.

97
00:05:28.811 --> 00:05:32.630
With the large wings condition has changed because of the orbit around Novus.

98
00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:35.530
Parent plant around its star for part of its orbit.

99
00:05:35.531 --> 00:05:37.480
It exists within the stars habitable zone,

100
00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:39.490
but then it swings out slightly past it.

101
00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:44.110
Winter on this world becomes unbearably cold and the aliens here must evolve to

102
00:05:44.111 --> 00:05:45.070
be able to handle it.

103
00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:48.280
Much of their time away from the colonies are still spent in flight.

104
00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:52.210
They've gotten longer and more flexible.
A clause and his legs,
however,

105
00:05:52.211 --> 00:05:54.880
still remain as sharp as ever from the days of their ancestors,

106
00:05:54.881 --> 00:05:59.060
but are more precise now allowing them to grip things more firmly and precisely

107
00:05:59.061 --> 00:06:02.510
a trait which has come in handy as they began to experiment with things like

108
00:06:02.511 --> 00:06:07.070
fire and tools well began with dropping blunt rocks and unsuspecting prey from

109
00:06:07.071 --> 00:06:10.820
above has evolved to dropping crudely sharpened rocks and much more effective

110
00:06:10.821 --> 00:06:14.990
method which could evolve into spheres.
They are strictly carnivorous.

111
00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:17.210
They have snouts with razor sharp teeth.

112
00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:19.280
They communicate with a large number of noises,

113
00:06:19.281 --> 00:06:22.940
a combination of different kinds of what sounds like complicated wolf barking

114
00:06:22.941 --> 00:06:24.560
mixed with flooding their tails.

115
00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:27.890
It's not get as complex as what we call a language on earth.

116
00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:31.670
The more complex than anything else we've observed on this planet.
Accordingly,

117
00:06:31.671 --> 00:06:33.890
if they had a name for the land or themselves,

118
00:06:33.891 --> 00:06:38.210
we wouldn't quite be able to pronounce it and accordingly,
the name Novus sticks.

119
00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:41.660
Still though these noises don't constitute all of their communication,

120
00:06:41.661 --> 00:06:44.930
especially in a mid flight hunt with a prey has evolved at Dotta.

121
00:06:44.931 --> 00:06:49.760
Tara from above gestures and even visible changes in their wings are important

122
00:06:49.761 --> 00:06:51.350
parts of relaying information,

123
00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:53.750
blood rushes through the wings and distinct patterns.

124
00:06:53.751 --> 00:06:57.230
When one of these aliens abuse potential food causing a visible riots and heat

125
00:06:57.231 --> 00:07:01.520
and signaling to the rest of the group to follow said aliens move other patterns

126
00:07:01.521 --> 00:07:05.720
and variations in the wing signal.
Other things,
fatigue,
aggression,

127
00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:08.840
sadness,
happiness,
fear,
sexual interest.

128
00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:12.740
We may struggle to recognize these emotions should we view them as there may

129
00:07:12.741 --> 00:07:16.130
only be my new differences between the wide range of emotions,

130
00:07:16.131 --> 00:07:17.870
which is aliens wish to convey,

131
00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:22.160
but they would likely come as naturally to these aliens as facial expressions do

132
00:07:22.161 --> 00:07:25.130
to us.
When a member of this racist shows aggression.

133
00:07:25.131 --> 00:07:27.890
Another may in turn naturally show aggression and defense,

134
00:07:28.070 --> 00:07:32.330
but more importantly when a member of a species is placed sadness,

135
00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:35.660
another may in turn also display sadness.

136
00:07:35.780 --> 00:07:39.830
These aliens have evolved the ability of empathy to relate to one another and

137
00:07:39.831 --> 00:07:41.150
exchange their thoughts.

138
00:07:41.270 --> 00:07:45.200
The males hunt down the parameters of the colonies if feed the females and the

139
00:07:45.201 --> 00:07:45.980
offspring,

140
00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:50.000
they hunt in a long night and rest and eat their kill and the long days.

141
00:07:50.180 --> 00:07:54.290
Hierarchy is important here and the Alpha male and female and their offspring

142
00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:57.920
eat first and progressively the rest eat as well.
Partners here,
mate,

143
00:07:57.921 --> 00:08:01.760
for life monogamy evolved and these organisms as to became more intelligent and

144
00:08:01.761 --> 00:08:04.370
their brains required longer to grow the eggs.

145
00:08:04.371 --> 00:08:07.850
They're primitive ancestors laid became more complicated sex which had to be

146
00:08:07.851 --> 00:08:11.720
guarded for several earth months and the offspring then took several earth years

147
00:08:11.721 --> 00:08:15.650
to reach adulthood.
Monogamy also helps stave off the remnants of violence,

148
00:08:15.651 --> 00:08:19.100
sexually transmitted disease which has been ravaging their continent and killing

149
00:08:19.101 --> 00:08:22.190
many.
This all sounds like quite a bit of imagination,

150
00:08:22.191 --> 00:08:26.480
but there are may scientific and logical reasons for these traits and the aliens

151
00:08:26.481 --> 00:08:30.740
of Novus.
Remember that convergent evolution thing I mentioned?
Convergence.

152
00:08:30.741 --> 00:08:35.741
Evolution is essentially were to essentially unrelated organisms evolve the same

153
00:08:35.841 --> 00:08:39.990
physical traits because of pressures from their environment on earth.
Birds,

154
00:08:40.010 --> 00:08:44.090
bats and butterflies evolve the wings independently of each other because it was

155
00:08:44.091 --> 00:08:45.950
useful and they're given environments.

156
00:08:46.010 --> 00:08:49.430
Why am I so sure that most aliens will have,
for example,

157
00:08:49.431 --> 00:08:52.130
some kind of eyes because of how useful they are.

158
00:08:52.340 --> 00:08:57.340
They evolved on earth over 500 million ago and have since evolved independently,

159
00:08:57.630 --> 00:09:01.380
independently around 50 to a hundred times,

160
00:09:01.470 --> 00:09:04.500
restart life on earth,
change the direction of a bit,

161
00:09:04.740 --> 00:09:07.920
come back in 500 million years,
whatever animal life is here,

162
00:09:07.921 --> 00:09:10.140
we'll have eyes again,

163
00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:14.370
not all eyes are the same and the aliens of Novus here seed very differently

164
00:09:14.371 --> 00:09:14.791
than we do,

165
00:09:14.791 --> 00:09:19.320
but there's an obvious evolutionary pressure in such a world to develop eyes.

166
00:09:19.470 --> 00:09:24.450
Some animal life on earth and caves and the deep sea are essentially blind,

167
00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:26.040
but it is not the norm in such.

168
00:09:26.041 --> 00:09:29.790
Life is at a disadvantage in environments with light and the same would hold

169
00:09:29.791 --> 00:09:34.290
true on similar worlds.
Why do these organisms fly?
Well,

170
00:09:34.350 --> 00:09:37.980
it's not necessary.
It was just a fictional addition to explore new concept,

171
00:09:37.981 --> 00:09:41.640
but some alien races in the universe may indeed have wings.

172
00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:45.480
More importantly though,
these aliens are social hunters.

173
00:09:45.540 --> 00:09:48.870
Why is that important?
Well,
looking again at life on earth,

174
00:09:48.871 --> 00:09:53.640
the smartest organisms are the ones which broadly have to figure things out.

175
00:09:53.730 --> 00:09:58.410
Many of the intelligent animals on earth such as raccoons,
whales,
birds of prey,

176
00:09:58.440 --> 00:10:02.790
dogs,
et Cetera,
are hunters or more often omnivores,
including us,

177
00:10:02.850 --> 00:10:07.200
the equivalent of a deer on the moon.
Novus just has to know how to eat,

178
00:10:07.380 --> 00:10:11.610
reproduce,
and run away,
and if it does fairly well for itself.
The hunter,
however,

179
00:10:11.611 --> 00:10:13.710
has to be able to track it,
predict its movements,

180
00:10:13.711 --> 00:10:15.390
coordinate with other members of the pack.

181
00:10:15.391 --> 00:10:18.180
There was an evolutionary pressure to be more cunning.

182
00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:22.110
Generally a Predator doesn't have to be a genius,
but as I mentioned,

183
00:10:22.111 --> 00:10:26.010
this moon has a rapidly changing environment because its host planet has an

184
00:10:26.011 --> 00:10:30.270
eccentric orbit similar to Africa or run the dawn of mankind or the ice age.

185
00:10:30.271 --> 00:10:31.500
Later on in human history,

186
00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:35.580
hunting in conditions which are constantly changing requires even more

187
00:10:35.581 --> 00:10:38.160
intelligence and more factors thrown into the game.

188
00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:41.040
The sharper you have to be and like our ancestors,

189
00:10:41.041 --> 00:10:45.930
these aliens are subject to those wild factors.
Being social,
as I mentioned,

190
00:10:45.931 --> 00:10:50.580
is an important aspect to these aliens are working together for a mutual goal of

191
00:10:50.581 --> 00:10:54.900
us developing a bond between each other and a mentality for cooperation.

192
00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:58.740
They are for the more developing the ability to communicate thoughts and

193
00:10:58.741 --> 00:10:59.700
feelings with each other.

194
00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:03.540
This greatly enhances their ability to work together and succeed and also

195
00:11:03.541 --> 00:11:07.620
depends upon a higher intelligence.
As their intelligence grows,

196
00:11:07.621 --> 00:11:10.440
they're able to not only find new ways to find food,

197
00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:14.520
but communicate those ideas to the rest of the group relatively quickly.
However,

198
00:11:14.521 --> 00:11:15.570
being carnivores,

199
00:11:15.571 --> 00:11:19.920
they are rather naturally aggressive for the more as they operate within a

200
00:11:19.921 --> 00:11:24.210
hierarchy.
We're an Alpha male and female.
Typically not only the most fit,

201
00:11:24.211 --> 00:11:27.840
but also the best hundreds of the group get the most food and have the best odds

202
00:11:27.841 --> 00:11:29.190
of reproducing successfully.

203
00:11:29.640 --> 00:11:33.960
There is great pressure within the colonies to be dominant.
This leads to fights,

204
00:11:33.961 --> 00:11:37.920
especially among males and with unpredictable quantities of resources,

205
00:11:37.921 --> 00:11:40.230
fights between colonies over hunting turf.

206
00:11:40.290 --> 00:11:43.920
These aliens are not afraid to use their tools and such in these fights,

207
00:11:43.921 --> 00:11:48.480
which should they progress into entire societies could leave to an equivalent of

208
00:11:48.481 --> 00:11:51.750
war,
which in the end may threaten their own very survival,

209
00:11:51.870 --> 00:11:55.240
their evolution to objects as crucial as well.

210
00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:59.380
Their claws of evolves from crude killing tools to precise instruments while

211
00:11:59.381 --> 00:12:01.450
supporting themselves with their powerful wings.

212
00:12:01.451 --> 00:12:04.840
They may use their claws in a similar fashion that we use our hands.

213
00:12:04.930 --> 00:12:08.020
So to summarize the aliens of the Moon,
Novus here,

214
00:12:08.110 --> 00:12:11.260
there are important differences but important similarities.

215
00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:15.670
The organisms here as will be the case with any organism you encounter anywhere

216
00:12:15.671 --> 00:12:19.300
in its original form has evolved to fit within its environment.

217
00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:22.510
If he wants to find the major differences between us and them,

218
00:12:22.511 --> 00:12:25.060
look at the important differences in our environments.

219
00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:29.290
Both earth and Novus are rocky warm water.
We roles with evolution,

220
00:12:29.291 --> 00:12:30.760
which followed a similar path,

221
00:12:30.820 --> 00:12:34.660
microorganisms which evolved in the photosynthetic organisms as well as animal

222
00:12:34.661 --> 00:12:34.931
life,

223
00:12:34.931 --> 00:12:39.010
which consumes those photosynthetic organisms and indeed hunters which consume

224
00:12:39.011 --> 00:12:41.350
those organisms and perhaps hunters on top of those.

225
00:12:41.351 --> 00:12:45.100
Hunters are the case on both worlds.
Such ecosystems,

226
00:12:45.101 --> 00:12:48.880
though they may be very complex,
may be the norm on earth like worlds,

227
00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:53.140
but they're star is dimmer or red dwarf unless they see a different kind of

228
00:12:53.141 --> 00:12:55.120
light,
much more effective for hunting,

229
00:12:55.121 --> 00:12:58.780
especially during long nights there gravity is lower and the atmosphere is

230
00:12:58.781 --> 00:13:02.440
proportionately thicker than ours making flight a much easier exercise.

231
00:13:02.620 --> 00:13:06.280
We can go on talking about potential differences that might arise in an infinite

232
00:13:06.281 --> 00:13:07.750
number of circumstances,
but what is,

233
00:13:07.810 --> 00:13:10.210
what's important to highlight is as similarities,

234
00:13:10.211 --> 00:13:14.440
which may be consistent among civilized intelligences or at least common.

235
00:13:14.650 --> 00:13:18.820
The first hypothesis is that many intelligent extraterrestrials will be

236
00:13:18.821 --> 00:13:20.590
omnivores or at least carnivores.

237
00:13:20.591 --> 00:13:24.850
Impossibly we'll have had ancestors who lived in rapidly changing environments.

238
00:13:24.940 --> 00:13:28.510
It's through this that nature seems to put pressure on organisms to develop

239
00:13:28.511 --> 00:13:30.250
higher intelligence.
Secondly,

240
00:13:30.340 --> 00:13:34.240
aliens across the universe may develop somewhat similar structures for survival,

241
00:13:34.270 --> 00:13:35.200
not just eyes,

242
00:13:35.201 --> 00:13:38.540
but I hope it can be inferred that many other structures come on on earth may be

243
00:13:38.541 --> 00:13:40.420
common among extra tress as well.

244
00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:44.560
They may not have all the sensory organs we have and may in fact have some that

245
00:13:44.561 --> 00:13:48.640
we lack their sensory organs much like ours will probably be close to their

246
00:13:48.641 --> 00:13:53.260
brain and all groups close by so that an organism may see smell and taste their

247
00:13:53.261 --> 00:13:56.170
food all at once.
Will they have,
for example,

248
00:13:56.200 --> 00:14:00.880
stereoscopic vision as the majority are probably carnivores or Omnivores,

249
00:14:00.881 --> 00:14:02.140
that is likely the case.

250
00:14:02.230 --> 00:14:06.280
Stereoscopic vision will be required for tool use later on when civilization

251
00:14:06.281 --> 00:14:09.490
actually arises.
Will they hear in the same range as us?

252
00:14:09.610 --> 00:14:14.080
Probably not exactly though.
Possibly similarly,
whether they have teeth,
some may,

253
00:14:14.230 --> 00:14:18.130
some may not.
Teeth seem to be very commonplace in useful.
Her many animals.

254
00:14:18.250 --> 00:14:21.760
What about the body structure of animals?
Well,
whereby pedal,

255
00:14:21.790 --> 00:14:24.700
which is Latin for two feet for two of course,

256
00:14:24.701 --> 00:14:27.640
how we walk and by bronchial which means two arms.

257
00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:30.880
Most animals are not quite structured like that,

258
00:14:30.881 --> 00:14:34.930
but most do have four limbs and manipulate their environment with their front or

259
00:14:34.931 --> 00:14:38.350
upper extremities.
The ones of course,
in their visual range,

260
00:14:38.440 --> 00:14:42.850
it's possible that other aliens will be head,
shoulders,
arms,
torso,
legs,
feet.

261
00:14:42.851 --> 00:14:46.210
In a similar fashion that we are,
but I wouldn't bet on it being the norm.

262
00:14:46.330 --> 00:14:48.400
The aliens of Novus,
for example,

263
00:14:48.640 --> 00:14:52.730
like birds are technically bipeds even though most of their long range moving is

264
00:14:52.731 --> 00:14:54.230
done through flight.
However,

265
00:14:54.231 --> 00:14:57.500
they are capable of supporting themselves what their wings and manipulating

266
00:14:57.501 --> 00:15:00.410
their environment with their rear extremities.
Well,

267
00:15:00.411 --> 00:15:05.411
they have exoskeletons or endoskeletons organisms with endoskeletons like us are

268
00:15:05.481 --> 00:15:07.670
the norm in larger intelligent animals,

269
00:15:07.820 --> 00:15:12.050
but that may not be consistently the case.
How many limbs were the aliens?
Have?

270
00:15:12.530 --> 00:15:15.410
Forests seems to work just fine for animals and in fact,

271
00:15:15.411 --> 00:15:19.430
adding on legs or arms may make things more difficult for larger organisms.

272
00:15:19.820 --> 00:15:23.570
Evolution has consistently selected organisms with four limbs.

273
00:15:23.720 --> 00:15:26.570
Will they be Endothermic,
Aka warm blooded?

274
00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:30.740
Probably warm blooded animals require more food and therefore have to be smarter

275
00:15:30.741 --> 00:15:34.790
to find it.
Furthermore,
complex brains do better in constant temperature.

276
00:15:34.940 --> 00:15:36.410
Importantly,
however,

277
00:15:36.411 --> 00:15:39.770
aliens are set up because of the great prevalence of symmetry in nature.

278
00:15:39.771 --> 00:15:42.920
Probably all intelligent extra terrestrials will be symmetrical.

279
00:15:43.010 --> 00:15:47.210
How will they reproduce?
Live bearing as we do may not be the norm.

280
00:15:47.270 --> 00:15:48.750
Asexual production,
however,

281
00:15:48.751 --> 00:15:52.040
it is not likely sexual reproduction in the genetic variation that accompanies

282
00:15:52.041 --> 00:15:56.270
it is very likely to be more beneficial than asexual reproduction in such

283
00:15:56.271 --> 00:15:57.590
organisms.
Accordingly,

284
00:15:57.890 --> 00:16:02.890
to avoid excessive complexity to core ism or the existence of male and female is

285
00:16:03.231 --> 00:16:05.050
probably the most commonplace.

286
00:16:05.210 --> 00:16:08.270
Will they breathe oxygen very possibly earth life.

287
00:16:08.271 --> 00:16:11.900
Then it become more complex until there was sufficient oxygen in the atmosphere.

288
00:16:11.960 --> 00:16:16.070
It's crucial for the metabolism of organisms like us and anaerobic organisms

289
00:16:16.071 --> 00:16:19.280
don't become nearly as diverse as oxygen and breathers.
Well,

290
00:16:19.281 --> 00:16:24.080
they bleed likely complex aliens will requires blood or some similar system to

291
00:16:24.081 --> 00:16:27.890
carry oxygen to their body and such well that blood be red if they're indeed

292
00:16:27.891 --> 00:16:28.701
breathing oxygen.

293
00:16:28.701 --> 00:16:32.990
Probably copper has been suggested as an alternative to the iron that makes our

294
00:16:32.991 --> 00:16:36.230
blood red and carries oxygen making blood green,

295
00:16:36.710 --> 00:16:41.270
but it isn't as efficient and on an even deeper level will they use DNA?

296
00:16:41.360 --> 00:16:45.620
Very likely.
Something like it.
Complex organisms don't just assemble themselves.

297
00:16:45.830 --> 00:16:49.250
We will most likely see alternatives to some of the things that we weren't

298
00:16:49.251 --> 00:16:49.910
expecting.

299
00:16:49.910 --> 00:16:54.380
But my point in all of this is to hypothesizes structures that we see evolve

300
00:16:54.381 --> 00:16:55.130
independently,

301
00:16:55.130 --> 00:16:59.660
over and over and be successful on earth in a wide variety of environments

302
00:16:59.720 --> 00:17:03.620
probably evolve on most earthlike worlds as well.
Although keep in mind,

303
00:17:03.650 --> 00:17:07.010
perhaps not every civilization comes from an earthlight world.

304
00:17:07.130 --> 00:17:10.910
I don't mean to suggest that nowhere in the entire university of things get

305
00:17:10.911 --> 00:17:12.920
unrecognizably weird.
Rather,

306
00:17:13.370 --> 00:17:16.730
I'm saying that we can make educated guesses about the average.

307
00:17:16.810 --> 00:17:19.490
I had referenced the Cambrian explosion to support this.

308
00:17:19.940 --> 00:17:24.230
The Cambrian explosion was a period in early Earth's history in which a very

309
00:17:24.231 --> 00:17:26.390
great variety of organisms evolve.

310
00:17:26.391 --> 00:17:31.110
There were some very weird looking organisms like this OPA Binya or this anomaly

311
00:17:31.120 --> 00:17:33.170
cars with time,

312
00:17:33.171 --> 00:17:37.520
the variety decrease as a structures that were inferior got weeded out by those

313
00:17:37.521 --> 00:17:38.660
which worked the best.

314
00:17:38.810 --> 00:17:42.020
The structures that work the best of course worked because they fit their

315
00:17:42.021 --> 00:17:44.840
respective environments and alien environments will be different,

316
00:17:45.080 --> 00:17:49.250
but we will only see drastic differences in drastically different environments.

317
00:17:49.260 --> 00:17:52.770
And I would guess that the basic conditions on earth might be around average for

318
00:17:52.771 --> 00:17:56.670
worlds that produced extraterrestrial intelligences.
Anyway.
Thirdly,

319
00:17:56.671 --> 00:18:00.760
alien civilizations were likely be social in the sense that they both work

320
00:18:00.761 --> 00:18:05.010
together,
communicate somehow,
not necessarily social in the sense that we are.

321
00:18:05.011 --> 00:18:08.130
They may be very different,
much more different than we can imagine,

322
00:18:08.131 --> 00:18:12.510
but cooperation and exchange of ideas are crucial to what we consider to be

323
00:18:12.511 --> 00:18:15.300
civilization.
Solitary hunters,

324
00:18:15.301 --> 00:18:19.320
perhaps even species in which males instinctively kill other males from mating

325
00:18:19.321 --> 00:18:22.950
rights probably cannot develop civilization as we understand it.

326
00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:27.390
How will aliens communicate?
Very likely every way possible.

327
00:18:27.690 --> 00:18:32.160
Humans use verbal language,
sign language and body language,
et Cetera,

328
00:18:32.250 --> 00:18:35.830
to communicate other animals on this planet.
He's a variety of ways.

329
00:18:35.831 --> 00:18:36.664
He naked as well.

330
00:18:37.020 --> 00:18:40.620
Things may be even more diverse among intelligent extra terrestrials throughout

331
00:18:40.621 --> 00:18:44.430
the universe.
Fourth,
they will need to be able to manipulate tools,

332
00:18:44.550 --> 00:18:46.350
not necessarily right off the bat.

333
00:18:46.380 --> 00:18:49.980
Humans only gradually evolved the ability to manipulate our environments with

334
00:18:49.981 --> 00:18:54.360
greater precision,
but taking a shark or a tiger or an elephant,

335
00:18:54.480 --> 00:18:57.450
even if they possess civilization building intelligence,

336
00:18:57.451 --> 00:18:59.580
they couldn't operate tools very well.

337
00:18:59.730 --> 00:19:02.970
It would be outside of their physical limitations and their intelligence would

338
00:19:02.971 --> 00:19:06.630
be mostly used to endure and their normal primitive lifestyles.

339
00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:09.600
Does that mean hands?
Not necessarily.

340
00:19:09.601 --> 00:19:13.170
Our hands work very well to get whatever job done or at least construct

341
00:19:13.171 --> 00:19:16.080
something that can get the job done.
And indeed the aliens of Novus,

342
00:19:16.081 --> 00:19:19.380
you'll see have clause which had begun evolving to work with tools,

343
00:19:19.770 --> 00:19:23.460
but other forms of manipulating environments may indeed be possible.

344
00:19:23.730 --> 00:19:27.930
So we've established those four hypotheses and we will of course review the mall

345
00:19:27.931 --> 00:19:30.720
at the end of the video for now.
Let's move on.

346
00:19:31.110 --> 00:19:33.150
As we leave this world to visit our next,

347
00:19:33.151 --> 00:19:36.330
we noticed something peculiar each morning.

348
00:19:36.360 --> 00:19:40.350
The members of the group pile rocks to the east of their colony where the star

349
00:19:40.351 --> 00:19:44.760
rises each morning when it begins to set in the evening.
And of course,

350
00:19:44.761 --> 00:19:47.490
remember one day on his planet lasts as long as a few on earth.

351
00:19:47.670 --> 00:19:51.090
The individuals fly to pile rocks west of there.
Connie,

352
00:19:51.180 --> 00:19:55.710
this ritual seems to serve no purpose and may be a purely cultural or religious

353
00:19:55.711 --> 00:19:58.830
practice.
For the more individuals at the colony who have died.

354
00:19:58.831 --> 00:20:02.490
Here are not left alone.
Much of the colony when a death occurs,

355
00:20:02.491 --> 00:20:06.240
flies with the individuals chosen to carry the corpse over.

356
00:20:06.241 --> 00:20:09.960
Large body of water with a corpse is dropped in from above.
Again,

357
00:20:09.961 --> 00:20:14.400
serving no survival purposes seeming to be a form of a funeral.

358
00:20:14.700 --> 00:20:16.560
One might wonder what they think of their world,

359
00:20:16.650 --> 00:20:20.550
whether they believe the Red Sun,
the guests giant,
the stars in the sky are,

360
00:20:20.760 --> 00:20:22.070
or maybe if they even follow up.

361
00:20:22.071 --> 00:20:24.720
Primitive religions similar to the ones of early earth.

362
00:20:24.840 --> 00:20:27.630
If a culture is passed along to their children the same way,

363
00:20:27.631 --> 00:20:32.220
practical survival knowledges and possibly if they are capable of thinking of

364
00:20:32.230 --> 00:20:33.120
abstractions,

365
00:20:33.210 --> 00:20:36.840
predicting the biological structures of extra terrestrials isn't easy.

366
00:20:36.870 --> 00:20:38.210
We may be wrong about a lot,

367
00:20:38.211 --> 00:20:41.610
but we can use organisms on our planet and the courses of evolution that they

368
00:20:41.611 --> 00:20:44.910
have taken to predict quite a bit about extraterrestrial evolution.

369
00:20:45.060 --> 00:20:49.570
Simply start with an earthlight world in a number of variables and subsequently

370
00:20:49.571 --> 00:20:51.760
come up with solutions to those differences.

371
00:20:51.880 --> 00:20:55.060
It's easier to make conjectures about biology and then culture.

372
00:20:55.061 --> 00:20:58.330
Though we don't have any other examples of culture other than what has been

373
00:20:58.331 --> 00:21:01.930
created from our own human experience and human minds.

374
00:21:02.140 --> 00:21:06.220
We have the behavior of other animals it take and play with and consider how bad

375
00:21:06.221 --> 00:21:09.700
behavior may manifest itself as culture or a society should.

376
00:21:09.701 --> 00:21:13.150
Greater intelligence arise and intelligent social animals on earth,

377
00:21:13.151 --> 00:21:17.950
especially many social animals have hierarchies and compete for dominance in for

378
00:21:17.951 --> 00:21:22.270
food rights and reproduction rights and some animals like elephants even mourn

379
00:21:22.271 --> 00:21:25.120
their dead or act selflessly for the betterment of the group,

380
00:21:25.240 --> 00:21:26.530
especially for the young.

381
00:21:26.650 --> 00:21:29.570
Many animals are scared of things which they do not understand but can be

382
00:21:29.571 --> 00:21:34.390
observed curiously investigating these things.
Nevertheless,
my dog,
for example,

383
00:21:34.391 --> 00:21:36.640
is scared of my guitar,
but if I set it down,

384
00:21:36.670 --> 00:21:39.760
he goes over and very hesitantly checks it out.

385
00:21:39.820 --> 00:21:44.320
This suggests that curiosity runs in many intelligent or somewhat intelligent

386
00:21:44.321 --> 00:21:45.010
species.

387
00:21:45.010 --> 00:21:48.820
It just manifests itself in a very complex way in humans and these things may

388
00:21:48.821 --> 00:21:52.720
hold true for other extra terrestrials as well.
Here,
for example,

389
00:21:52.721 --> 00:21:56.560
the aliens of Novus are clearly moving the rocks from east to west following a

390
00:21:56.561 --> 00:22:00.100
path of their son.
Perhaps out of respect,
perhaps out of fear,

391
00:22:00.340 --> 00:22:04.180
but the fact that they have a ritual around a naturally occurring event,

392
00:22:04.181 --> 00:22:08.110
which doesn't seem to aid their survival as evidence that they have as questions

393
00:22:08.111 --> 00:22:11.950
about their environment and that they are curious that they have a solution for

394
00:22:11.951 --> 00:22:15.640
those questions suggest that they can generate abstractions in their mind.

395
00:22:15.700 --> 00:22:19.210
The fact they have a sort of burial ritual suggests that they mourn their dead.

396
00:22:19.211 --> 00:22:20.200
They feel empathy,

397
00:22:20.230 --> 00:22:23.970
which we know as well because of their wing patterns and death and a questions

398
00:22:23.980 --> 00:22:28.210
they likely ask about it as curious animals,
mainly the culture,
tradition,

399
00:22:28.240 --> 00:22:29.660
society,
et Cetera.

400
00:22:29.830 --> 00:22:34.510
Trying to define alien culture is essentially asking yourself a thing from a

401
00:22:34.511 --> 00:22:38.320
perspective that is not your own but about which you know nothing in an

402
00:22:38.321 --> 00:22:42.280
environment in which you know nothing as well.
Even for the most creative,

403
00:22:42.281 --> 00:22:45.460
it is a very difficult task.
As I said earlier on in this video,

404
00:22:45.461 --> 00:22:49.930
we lack an example of what is intelligent but not human for comparison.

405
00:22:49.931 --> 00:22:54.910
So it is difficult to be sure what traits,
ideas,
philosophy,
culture,
et cetera.

406
00:22:54.911 --> 00:22:59.080
Guarding intelligent species are specific to humans or commonplace among

407
00:22:59.081 --> 00:23:00.910
intelligent beings.
One day,

408
00:23:00.911 --> 00:23:05.300
perhaps these aliens will learn to master things like animal husbandry by taking

409
00:23:05.301 --> 00:23:07.900
control the populations of animals they currently hunt.

410
00:23:08.050 --> 00:23:11.500
The aliens of Novus may build more complicated structures when they come to

411
00:23:11.501 --> 00:23:16.330
process more complicated language.
They may go from rocks to spears to beyond.

412
00:23:16.390 --> 00:23:18.490
One day we may meet such an alien race,

413
00:23:18.491 --> 00:23:22.030
but for now this theoretical race is to be left for a new world.

414
00:23:22.150 --> 00:23:24.760
Let's visit a world known as Panthalassa.

415
00:23:24.910 --> 00:23:28.870
Panthalassa is a world which orbits a star of much like our son and is

416
00:23:28.871 --> 00:23:32.020
relatively the same size as earth with similar gravity.

417
00:23:32.020 --> 00:23:34.240
Just to make this example of straight forward,

418
00:23:34.390 --> 00:23:38.140
the big difference is that the whole planet is covered in water.

419
00:23:38.141 --> 00:23:40.840
Not a single island is to be found anywhere on this planet.

420
00:23:40.870 --> 00:23:45.800
Such planets called Ocean planets or water worlds are believed to exist being

421
00:23:45.801 --> 00:23:47.870
somewhat common among habitable worlds.

422
00:23:47.930 --> 00:23:51.500
It's not so outrageous remembering how common water is in the universe and how

423
00:23:51.501 --> 00:23:55.910
three fourths of our planet on the surface as water within the great oceans of

424
00:23:55.911 --> 00:24:00.260
Penta Lasa exists a peculiar species and intelligent species that looks somewhat

425
00:24:00.261 --> 00:24:03.080
like an octopus,
but with four appendages.
So if you'd like,

426
00:24:03.081 --> 00:24:04.550
you may call it quadruples.

427
00:24:04.640 --> 00:24:07.780
These 10 schools are very thick and powerful and assistant quadruple.

428
00:24:07.830 --> 00:24:09.500
I'm moving quickly throughout the water.

429
00:24:09.650 --> 00:24:13.250
The quadro pie meet all the criteria we listed on Novis.

430
00:24:13.280 --> 00:24:15.890
Their environment isn't accessibly turbulent,

431
00:24:15.891 --> 00:24:19.910
but they are extremely omnivorous finding food and seemingly unlikely places.

432
00:24:19.940 --> 00:24:21.140
They have no ability to hear,

433
00:24:21.141 --> 00:24:24.170
but they have a very acute sense of smell and are capable of seeing a huge

434
00:24:24.171 --> 00:24:26.090
amount of colors in a visible light spectrum.

435
00:24:26.210 --> 00:24:28.880
Odd considering they spend perhaps half of the time,
the deeper,

436
00:24:28.881 --> 00:24:32.420
darker areas of the sea at that we reached the third point.

437
00:24:32.660 --> 00:24:35.030
These organisms communicate with elaborate,

438
00:24:35.031 --> 00:24:38.810
changing patterns of colors on a tentacles very precisely coordinated

439
00:24:38.811 --> 00:24:42.530
bioluminescent patterns resembling the complexity of human language.

440
00:24:42.560 --> 00:24:46.070
While these organisms could simply consume the variety of photosynthetic

441
00:24:46.071 --> 00:24:47.720
organisms on the surface of the planet,

442
00:24:48.020 --> 00:24:51.110
it is not the preferred meal and it's much more worthwhile hunting.

443
00:24:51.111 --> 00:24:53.330
The variety of organisms that live in the ocean.

444
00:24:53.480 --> 00:24:57.500
This species stays together and packs from mutual defense and survival.

445
00:24:57.560 --> 00:25:00.740
The females carry the young for the equivalent of six earth months,

446
00:25:00.741 --> 00:25:04.310
but the species is frequently on a move making gestation difficult.

447
00:25:04.400 --> 00:25:06.560
They're a skilled hunters coordinating attacks.

448
00:25:06.640 --> 00:25:10.190
It confuse and enclose upon prey in the place of hands,

449
00:25:10.191 --> 00:25:13.910
which we and our alien friends on Novis use.
They have tentacles,

450
00:25:13.911 --> 00:25:17.960
which in time could evolve to manipulate their environment to build tools and

451
00:25:17.961 --> 00:25:21.230
such things,
but what environment?

452
00:25:21.560 --> 00:25:23.300
The planet is a giant ocean.

453
00:25:23.301 --> 00:25:27.320
The solid surface is miles beneath endless water and down on the bottom where

454
00:25:27.321 --> 00:25:31.670
one finally reaches a solid surface,
the pressure is perhaps unbearably great,

455
00:25:31.790 --> 00:25:35.690
so great that water may condense into ice called ice seven not as a result of

456
00:25:35.691 --> 00:25:38.240
temperature,
but as I said,
extreme pressure,

457
00:25:38.241 --> 00:25:42.350
forcing the water molecules into a solid only ocean like organisms and perhaps

458
00:25:42.351 --> 00:25:44.690
the organism to the sky inhabit this world.

459
00:25:44.810 --> 00:25:47.960
Neither have the materials needed to get civilization.

460
00:25:47.990 --> 00:25:52.370
As we understand that going and even if it did metallurgy,
electronics,

461
00:25:52.371 --> 00:25:56.300
and many other things which we take for granted are impossible underwater.

462
00:25:56.450 --> 00:26:01.450
The quadro pods of pound philoso serve to bring us to our fifth hypothesis are

463
00:26:01.611 --> 00:26:05.060
closely related.
Fourth hypothesis was that aliens needed to have the,

464
00:26:05.150 --> 00:26:07.190
the ability to manipulate their environment.

465
00:26:07.460 --> 00:26:11.030
Our fifth is that intelligent extraterrestrial must have an environment to

466
00:26:11.031 --> 00:26:12.620
manipulate in the first place.

467
00:26:12.680 --> 00:26:16.910
Organisms which exist in the clouds of gas giants or in great endless oceans

468
00:26:16.911 --> 00:26:19.280
like 10th Alessa may evolve intelligence,

469
00:26:19.640 --> 00:26:23.870
but their environments aren't suitable to build civilization for that.

470
00:26:23.871 --> 00:26:26.900
One would like to,
if need lands as on earth accordingly,

471
00:26:26.930 --> 00:26:29.770
the quadro pause main dear as primitive hunters indefinitely,

472
00:26:29.771 --> 00:26:33.620
definitely despite their intellectual capabilities.
So let's move on.

473
00:26:33.830 --> 00:26:35.990
Thus far we've been rather superficial.

474
00:26:35.991 --> 00:26:38.210
We've discussed aliens in their environments,

475
00:26:38.211 --> 00:26:40.340
but to really get to know a living organism,

476
00:26:40.341 --> 00:26:44.070
you have to know them deep down what makes them up.

477
00:26:44.220 --> 00:26:47.700
What about their environment is crucial to their existence.

478
00:26:48.090 --> 00:26:51.540
Biologists are agreed on three fundamental requisites.

479
00:26:52.050 --> 00:26:56.610
Life requires an energy source.
Essential building blocks I he chemicals.

480
00:26:56.700 --> 00:27:00.150
And a liquid solvent for proper comparison.
Let's ask,

481
00:27:00.420 --> 00:27:03.210
what are those things for earth life for you?
Well,

482
00:27:03.240 --> 00:27:06.840
the energy source for humans and most earth life is of course the sun.

483
00:27:06.870 --> 00:27:09.240
The Sun is of course at the center of the food chain.

484
00:27:09.300 --> 00:27:13.290
I'm hoping you recall photosynthesis and such things from biology.
However,

485
00:27:13.740 --> 00:27:16.200
not all are life is dependent on the sun.

486
00:27:16.201 --> 00:27:19.620
There are organisms and the deep sea which utilize hydrothermal vents.

487
00:27:20.070 --> 00:27:23.130
If the sun were to disappear,
they might not notice at all.

488
00:27:23.790 --> 00:27:27.540
Such organisms providing courage meant for the possibility of life on a world

489
00:27:27.541 --> 00:27:30.240
like Europa.
However,
not as much for civilization.

490
00:27:30.241 --> 00:27:33.420
Remember the unlikelihood of deep seas civilizations that we just discussed,

491
00:27:33.900 --> 00:27:36.330
these key metrics and then a deep sea are fine,

492
00:27:36.331 --> 00:27:40.740
but all known intelligent animals on earth are dependent on the sun directly and

493
00:27:40.741 --> 00:27:44.370
indirectly and it's hard to imagine many more suitable energy sources.

494
00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:45.571
Accordingly,

495
00:27:45.571 --> 00:27:49.520
the majority of intelligent aliens will likely have evolved on a rocky world,

496
00:27:49.530 --> 00:27:54.450
an ecosystem dependent on its host star,
I would say within the habitable zone,

497
00:27:54.570 --> 00:27:58.230
the region around the star in which earthlike planets could support liquid water

498
00:27:58.231 --> 00:28:02.850
on their surface.
But that brings me to my next question here on earth.

499
00:28:02.851 --> 00:28:05.820
The ingredients that make you up are pretty well understood.

500
00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:08.160
You are a carbon based life form.
Many,

501
00:28:08.161 --> 00:28:12.150
much of your makeup consists of carbon compounds.
You need oxygen,
hydrogen,

502
00:28:12.210 --> 00:28:16.920
nitrogen,
calcium,
phosphorous,
potassium,
sulfur,
sodium chloride,
magnesium,

503
00:28:16.921 --> 00:28:19.230
iron,
and some of the chemicals as well.

504
00:28:20.190 --> 00:28:23.430
All of these ingredients come together in our solvent,
water,

505
00:28:23.850 --> 00:28:28.380
every living thing on earth as a carbon based life form in this manner and every

506
00:28:28.381 --> 00:28:30.000
single one requires water.

507
00:28:30.150 --> 00:28:34.500
But are we sure that carbon based life forms and water are the only ways life

508
00:28:34.501 --> 00:28:35.820
may have dealt in the universe?

509
00:28:36.060 --> 00:28:40.590
It is in fact unclear a popular alternative to carbon.
It's silicon,

510
00:28:40.650 --> 00:28:43.800
but scientists aren't so willing to accept many alternatives.

511
00:28:44.130 --> 00:28:48.270
Carbon has common 10 times more common in silicon.
It's flexible,
it's versatile,

512
00:28:48.271 --> 00:28:51.240
it forms a wider variety of bonds.
Silicon forms,

513
00:28:51.241 --> 00:28:53.160
bonds with organic molecules as well,

514
00:28:53.161 --> 00:28:56.700
but the bonds are not as diverse or stable as those with carbon,

515
00:28:56.910 --> 00:28:59.190
other alternatives or even less promising than carbon.

516
00:28:59.310 --> 00:29:00.720
If you know your cell biology,

517
00:29:00.721 --> 00:29:04.530
you know just how intricate and complicated life and it's tiny as levels can be.

518
00:29:04.800 --> 00:29:09.750
Those million and a half functions with their esoteric names require
versatility.

519
00:29:10.040 --> 00:29:14.910
So silicon life forms or by foam is made of any other billing box may exist,

520
00:29:15.390 --> 00:29:16.920
but they're likely not common.

521
00:29:16.921 --> 00:29:20.460
There likely very outnumbered by carbon based life forms as carbon,

522
00:29:20.461 --> 00:29:24.240
very much outnumbered silicon and the universe with regard to alien

523
00:29:24.241 --> 00:29:28.410
civilizations of likelihood is that anyone we meet would be carbon based or had

524
00:29:28.411 --> 00:29:32.580
origins in carbon.
What about water?
Water has a similar story.

525
00:29:32.581 --> 00:29:35.910
It's a very common throughout the universe and it's very good at what it does.

526
00:29:36.360 --> 00:29:37.200
Like carbon,

527
00:29:37.230 --> 00:29:40.590
we can conclude right off the bath of the most intelligent aliens we meet.

528
00:29:40.590 --> 00:29:42.310
We require just as we do,

529
00:29:42.430 --> 00:29:46.000
but of course alternatives have been proposed and hypothetical life forms that

530
00:29:46.001 --> 00:29:49.570
don't require water are somewhat more attractive to the non carbon based life

531
00:29:49.571 --> 00:29:54.520
forms.
Scientists have suggested ammonia hydrocarbons such as methane and ethane,

532
00:29:54.880 --> 00:29:57.100
hydrogen fluoride,
sulfuric acid,

533
00:29:57.101 --> 00:30:00.400
liquid nitrogen as well as others as replacements.

534
00:30:00.520 --> 00:30:04.200
But what's so great about water besides being commonplace?
Well.

535
00:30:04.220 --> 00:30:08.290
The polarity of water allows it to dissolve more chemicals than any other
liquid,

536
00:30:08.291 --> 00:30:11.950
even the strongest acids on our planet,
just not as violently.
Of course.

537
00:30:12.190 --> 00:30:14.650
Furthermore,
water has some important properties.

538
00:30:14.680 --> 00:30:18.280
It has a high heat capacity and has the uncommon trait of being less den to the

539
00:30:18.281 --> 00:30:19.450
solid in the liquid,

540
00:30:19.451 --> 00:30:22.120
which I'm sure you've noticed if you've ever put ice in your drink.

541
00:30:23.050 --> 00:30:26.890
Why does that matter?
Because of bodies of water were to freeze solid.

542
00:30:26.891 --> 00:30:28.240
With the inverse being the case,

543
00:30:28.270 --> 00:30:31.540
they'd freeze bottom up being much more destructive to forming.

544
00:30:31.540 --> 00:30:33.850
Life below water is common place,

545
00:30:33.851 --> 00:30:36.180
but of course worlds with bodies of other liquids,

546
00:30:36.181 --> 00:30:40.240
siblings this throughout the universe.
In fact,
you can see one with a telescope.

547
00:30:40.270 --> 00:30:44.860
Titan,
Saturn's largest moon is such a world that has lakes of hydrocarbons,
I,

548
00:30:44.920 --> 00:30:49.750
methane and ethane on its surface with an average temperature of negative 180

549
00:30:49.751 --> 00:30:53.230
degrees Celsius.
That's far too cold for any water loving organisms,

550
00:30:53.231 --> 00:30:57.070
but for just right for organisms utilizing the hydrocarbons at a solvent.

551
00:30:57.610 --> 00:30:59.260
Perhaps if we revisit tightened,

552
00:30:59.261 --> 00:31:01.750
we'll find organisms on its surface and the lakes.

553
00:31:01.930 --> 00:31:04.660
But in our brief look at Titan when we visited the plant,

554
00:31:04.661 --> 00:31:08.470
we didn't find grandiose life forms that we'd expect with intelligent life.

555
00:31:08.860 --> 00:31:12.820
No one contacted earth and told us to come get our Huygens probe author lawn.

556
00:31:13.060 --> 00:31:15.820
So in summary,
organisms throughout the universe,

557
00:31:15.821 --> 00:31:19.930
possibly even intelligent life may be built from many different kinds of things

558
00:31:19.931 --> 00:31:23.920
about the commonality in effectiveness of water and carbon suggested the most

559
00:31:23.921 --> 00:31:28.900
intelligent aliens we will find will be built with considerable similarity to
us.

560
00:31:29.290 --> 00:31:32.920
Other factors of course include gravity not being excessively weaker than the

561
00:31:32.921 --> 00:31:34.540
earth or accessibly strong.

562
00:31:34.690 --> 00:31:38.200
The planet will probably require a magnetic field as well.
Otherwise,

563
00:31:38.201 --> 00:31:41.800
the ingredients that would have made worlds like Venus and Mars habitable will

564
00:31:41.801 --> 00:31:43.900
be stripped away by their host stars.

565
00:31:44.110 --> 00:31:46.000
But could this magnetic field be too strong?

566
00:31:46.300 --> 00:31:50.500
Remember that evolution occurs by mistakes being made when DNA copies itself

567
00:31:50.620 --> 00:31:52.480
caused largely by solar radiation.

568
00:31:53.170 --> 00:31:55.750
And of course we have to consider other factors as well.

569
00:31:55.810 --> 00:31:58.270
Remember that we might've had more extinctions on earth,

570
00:31:58.271 --> 00:32:01.590
if not for a big brother Jupiter collecting space to breathe that would've

571
00:32:01.630 --> 00:32:05.500
otherwise hit us.
And remember how fortunate we are to live where we do.

572
00:32:05.501 --> 00:32:09.610
And the galaxy closer to the center of the galaxy where there is much more going

573
00:32:09.611 --> 00:32:14.050
on.
The evolution of life may have been hindered by supernova and black holes and

574
00:32:14.051 --> 00:32:18.700
such.
So we've outlined a good number of basic requisites and likelihoods.

575
00:32:18.820 --> 00:32:23.650
And despite the complexity,
we have some solid hypotheses we're not done yet.

576
00:32:23.651 --> 00:32:26.490
Though there are more factors to consider,
more possibilities for review,

577
00:32:26.500 --> 00:32:30.790
considering how aliens may turn out and what kind of circumstances we can

578
00:32:30.791 --> 00:32:32.800
predict a find.
But for now,

579
00:32:32.801 --> 00:32:37.300
let's actually calculate just how many civilizations might exist in the Milky

580
00:32:37.301 --> 00:32:38.980
Way galaxy at this point in time.

581
00:32:39.210 --> 00:32:43.040
Such a prediction might sound like it rests upon a relatively weak foundation.

582
00:32:43.041 --> 00:32:46.760
There's not a lot that we know about the universe to make such a prediction.

583
00:32:46.820 --> 00:32:47.571
And quite frankly,

584
00:32:47.571 --> 00:32:51.950
the answer could be as high as a billion and as low as one us.

585
00:32:52.430 --> 00:32:53.180
Well,
yes,

586
00:32:53.180 --> 00:32:56.230
there is a lot that we don't know that we have a significant amount of knowledge

587
00:32:56.231 --> 00:32:59.930
of it.
Can you use to at least make a good hypothesis?

588
00:33:00.020 --> 00:33:01.610
We're not just pulling numbers out of the air.

589
00:33:01.610 --> 00:33:04.190
There's actually an equation for it.
The Drake equation,

590
00:33:04.370 --> 00:33:06.350
the Drake equation works like this.

591
00:33:06.860 --> 00:33:11.090
You start with the rate of star formation and the Milky Way galaxy or as Carl

592
00:33:11.090 --> 00:33:13.460
Sagan did it and as we will do for the purposes of this video,

593
00:33:13.880 --> 00:33:18.530
the amount of stars currently in our Milky Way Galaxy represented by n sub star.

594
00:33:19.100 --> 00:33:22.670
Multiply that by the fraction of stars that have planets and moons,

595
00:33:22.860 --> 00:33:27.470
F sub p then the number of planets and sizable moons around each star which are

596
00:33:27.471 --> 00:33:32.471
ecologically suitable for life and sub e the fraction of those worlds which

597
00:33:32.511 --> 00:33:37.280
actually do develop life apps of l the number of worlds I'm which intelligent

598
00:33:37.281 --> 00:33:40.670
life arises from those lifeforms f sub I,

599
00:33:40.940 --> 00:33:44.870
the number of worlds on which civilizations arise from that intelligence f sub c

600
00:33:44.871 --> 00:33:48.410
and the number of those civilizations which have not yet died out by self

601
00:33:48.411 --> 00:33:51.410
destruction.
F Sub d.
You can do this yourself,

602
00:33:51.411 --> 00:33:55.280
multiplied those together to get n the number of civilizations which may

603
00:33:55.281 --> 00:33:58.070
currently exist in the Milky Way galaxy.
Keep in mind,

604
00:33:58.071 --> 00:34:01.100
this is just one way of doing it as a model isn't the most common way in.

605
00:34:01.101 --> 00:34:05.270
There are a number of other factors suggested to be included in all forms are

606
00:34:05.271 --> 00:34:09.860
nothing more than educated guesswork,
but for now it'll do so end sub star.

607
00:34:09.861 --> 00:34:13.040
How many stars are in our galaxy that we do know?

608
00:34:13.280 --> 00:34:15.830
Roughly the lowest estimate is a 100 billion.

609
00:34:15.831 --> 00:34:20.690
The highest estimate is 400 billion.
The standard modern estimate is 200 billion,

610
00:34:20.691 --> 00:34:24.710
so we'll go with that.
How many of those stars have planets?
Well,

611
00:34:24.711 --> 00:34:28.460
modern science actually shows that planets are plentiful throughout the galaxy.

612
00:34:28.461 --> 00:34:32.190
Perhaps most stars have planets.
And furthermore,

613
00:34:32.200 --> 00:34:36.770
the discovery that binary systems can host planets as well only adds onto this

614
00:34:36.950 --> 00:34:40.970
will be conservative and say about half of all stars in the galaxy have planets.

615
00:34:41.120 --> 00:34:43.370
So of the hundred billion stars with planets,

616
00:34:43.371 --> 00:34:47.240
how many habitable worlds are there around the each star on average?

617
00:34:47.630 --> 00:34:50.000
If you've seen my life on other worlds series,

618
00:34:50.001 --> 00:34:53.660
you probably know that there are 10 or 11 worlds including the earth,

619
00:34:54.020 --> 00:34:56.150
which could be considered to have life on them.

620
00:34:56.660 --> 00:35:00.320
That's the highest estimate though the atmospheres of Jupiter and Venus and the

621
00:35:00.321 --> 00:35:04.130
hydrocarbon lakes of Titan are included in that estimate and all except for

622
00:35:04.131 --> 00:35:08.270
those and for Mars and earth refer to life in subsurface ocean is which may or

623
00:35:08.271 --> 00:35:10.130
may not possible.
Furthermore,

624
00:35:10.160 --> 00:35:13.190
we may have an unusually high prevalence of such worlds,

625
00:35:13.191 --> 00:35:17.120
but then modern estimates are so bold as to predict that one out of six stars in

626
00:35:17.121 --> 00:35:19.100
the galaxy hasn't earthlight world around it.

627
00:35:19.400 --> 00:35:23.570
So we'll just say on average one suitable world around each star.

628
00:35:23.571 --> 00:35:26.990
So there are about a hundred billion worlds in our galaxy,

629
00:35:26.991 --> 00:35:29.720
which we would be interested in taking a look at to look for life.

630
00:35:29.930 --> 00:35:33.380
How often though there's life actually arise on those worlds.
Well,

631
00:35:33.381 --> 00:35:37.040
I don't see why life wouldn't arise in a world which we considered to be

632
00:35:37.260 --> 00:35:38.310
suitable for life,

633
00:35:38.310 --> 00:35:42.570
<v 1>life or rosemary quickly on our world and stuck.
It seems unnecessary to ask,</v>

634
00:35:42.571 --> 00:35:46.290
but it takes into account that we aren't aware of certain conditions necessary

635
00:35:46.291 --> 00:35:47.124
to start life,

636
00:35:47.460 --> 00:35:51.240
so it will say only on 80% of world's on which we expect to find in life.

637
00:35:51.241 --> 00:35:52.680
Does life actually arrives?

638
00:35:52.770 --> 00:35:55.920
That still leaves 80 billion inhabited worlds in our galaxy alone,

639
00:35:55.921 --> 00:35:57.090
which has quite a number,

640
00:35:57.240 --> 00:36:01.650
but now those numbers get cut down on how many worlds does life evolved to be so

641
00:36:01.651 --> 00:36:06.180
complex that it actually gives a rise to intelligence?
Well,
on our planet,

642
00:36:06.181 --> 00:36:10.560
it took over three and a half billion years of microbial life for complex life

643
00:36:10.561 --> 00:36:12.630
to evolve into multicellular organisms,

644
00:36:12.631 --> 00:36:16.590
and our planet has some very suitable conditions.
Probably the majority,

645
00:36:16.680 --> 00:36:20.760
the vast majority of those 80 billion worlds are home to nothing more complex

646
00:36:20.790 --> 00:36:22.680
than bacteria.
Beyond that,

647
00:36:22.681 --> 00:36:25.680
and the 500 million years or so of multicellular organisms,

648
00:36:25.681 --> 00:36:28.650
there has been only one species in that entire time span,

649
00:36:28.651 --> 00:36:31.500
which has evolved to our level of intelligence.
Obviously us,

650
00:36:31.980 --> 00:36:35.610
there are other smart animals like chimpanzees,
dolphins,
raccoons,

651
00:36:35.611 --> 00:36:39.330
but they're not exactly on the path to civilization and there's no evidence to

652
00:36:39.331 --> 00:36:42.650
think that they would be among inhabited worlds.
Earth,

653
00:36:42.660 --> 00:36:46.440
leg worlds are probably the minority among earthlike worlds.

654
00:36:46.470 --> 00:36:51.090
Complex life might not evolve quite so often,
and among that complex life,

655
00:36:51.360 --> 00:36:53.820
intelligence might in fact be very rare,

656
00:36:54.420 --> 00:36:56.790
so it will take a very low estimate.

657
00:36:56.970 --> 00:37:01.970
0.0001% of inhabited worlds actually develop intelligent beings capable of

658
00:37:03.151 --> 00:37:06.780
developing civilization.
That brings us to 8 million.

659
00:37:07.500 --> 00:37:11.040
Now this next one is in reference to the eighth and ninth hypothetical rules

660
00:37:11.041 --> 00:37:11.874
I've listed here.

661
00:37:12.150 --> 00:37:15.810
How many of those intelligent beings actually developed civilization?
Well,

662
00:37:15.811 --> 00:37:19.440
probably the circumstances which put pressure for intelligence to develop our

663
00:37:19.441 --> 00:37:22.890
common on worlds on which intelligence can actually evolve into something.

664
00:37:23.610 --> 00:37:27.720
Gas Giants and water worlds with intelligent beings may be rare to begin with

665
00:37:27.721 --> 00:37:31.110
because there's no pressure to be a big brain.
Furthermore,

666
00:37:31.111 --> 00:37:35.220
not all intelligent beings might be capable of building civilization and perhaps

667
00:37:35.221 --> 00:37:39.150
not all intelligence manifests itself in the way that ours does to where

668
00:37:39.151 --> 00:37:42.570
intelligent beings or at least beings we would consider intelligent,

669
00:37:42.810 --> 00:37:45.330
don't create what we consider socialization,

670
00:37:45.390 --> 00:37:48.990
so we'll say half the time and that might be a low estimate.

671
00:37:49.410 --> 00:37:54.210
Intelligent beings actually build a civilization that leaves us with 4 million

672
00:37:54.211 --> 00:37:58.770
civilizations.
That's a huge number.
Now for the final variable here,

673
00:37:58.771 --> 00:38:02.610
how many of those civilizations destroy themselves before they really begin to

674
00:38:02.611 --> 00:38:06.630
move out and communicate for long periods of time?
That's very unpredictable.

675
00:38:06.631 --> 00:38:11.490
We don't know exactly how alien minds work regarding their technologies,

676
00:38:11.550 --> 00:38:13.860
war,
power,
politics,
et cetera.

677
00:38:14.070 --> 00:38:18.300
Some may be more ridiculous than us.
Some may be more level headed.

678
00:38:18.600 --> 00:38:19.560
It's hard to say it,

679
00:38:19.561 --> 00:38:23.730
but for now we'll say about half of all civilizations destroy themselves with a

680
00:38:23.731 --> 00:38:27.630
war or misuse technology or something of that nature.
Aggressiveness,

681
00:38:27.631 --> 00:38:31.350
the desire for power and the willingness to kill a present in many animal

682
00:38:31.351 --> 00:38:35.920
species on earth and are found even of course in our own species far too

683
00:38:35.921 --> 00:38:40.000
regularly,
it's probably the case among other intelligent beings as well,

684
00:38:40.001 --> 00:38:43.870
especially as they have likely evolved from omnivorous or carnivores social

685
00:38:43.871 --> 00:38:44.410
units.

686
00:38:44.410 --> 00:38:48.490
That brings us with these estimates to 2 million civilizations out there and the

687
00:38:48.491 --> 00:38:52.750
Milky Way alone,
which have already evolved or are on their way to be evolving.

688
00:38:53.200 --> 00:38:55.570
Maybe these estimates seem pretty high to you.

689
00:38:55.700 --> 00:38:57.610
If you disagree with me on one of these points,

690
00:38:57.640 --> 00:39:02.640
we can even lower it to 200,000 that's still a lot of civilizations out there.

691
00:39:03.040 --> 00:39:04.930
Do you see a problem with that though?

692
00:39:05.150 --> 00:39:09.580
Why do these civilizations have had a head start of a couple billion years

693
00:39:09.581 --> 00:39:13.300
before us?
By now at least,
some should be extremely advanced,

694
00:39:13.301 --> 00:39:14.740
but regardless,

695
00:39:14.950 --> 00:39:18.640
we have zero evidence of any activity outside of our solar system.

696
00:39:18.970 --> 00:39:23.230
No Dyson's spheres,
no radio signals,
not even an accidental text message.

697
00:39:23.590 --> 00:39:27.770
The apparent likelihood of an abundance of civilizations mixed with the apparent

698
00:39:27.771 --> 00:39:31.390
of lack of any evidence for them throughout all of history is called the Fermi

699
00:39:31.391 --> 00:39:32.224
paradox.

700
00:39:32.650 --> 00:39:36.940
Astrobiologist who share this concern have laid out a number of reasons for
this.

701
00:39:37.570 --> 00:39:42.010
The first intelligent civilization building life or even multicellular,

702
00:39:42.011 --> 00:39:46.360
animalistic life is rare.
I agreed.
I gave the rise of intelligence.

703
00:39:46.361 --> 00:39:49.930
I'm very low estimate of my equation,
but perhaps it's even rarer than that.

704
00:39:50.440 --> 00:39:53.590
Perhaps most life harboring worlds and about the course of their evolution

705
00:39:53.591 --> 00:39:56.980
without ever evolving intelligence.
Perhaps there are very few,

706
00:39:56.981 --> 00:40:00.820
or we are among the first to have this rare gift,
so of course it's silent.

707
00:40:01.150 --> 00:40:03.940
The second life itself is very rare.

708
00:40:04.540 --> 00:40:06.850
We're not entirely sure how life began on earth.

709
00:40:06.851 --> 00:40:08.780
We have yet to recreate the process,

710
00:40:08.781 --> 00:40:12.370
so perhaps there's something very crucial we're missing about how life

711
00:40:12.371 --> 00:40:15.940
originates.
That lowers his prediction drastically.
Number three,

712
00:40:16.420 --> 00:40:19.810
alien intelligence evolves at a somewhat predicted rate,

713
00:40:19.960 --> 00:40:24.460
but the problem rests in the sub destruction variable.
Intelligent civilizations,

714
00:40:24.461 --> 00:40:27.820
as I said,
it probably evolved from aggressive animals.
The hunters,

715
00:40:27.821 --> 00:40:31.750
carnivores and Omnivores,
many that are social,
maybe very hierarchal,

716
00:40:31.840 --> 00:40:36.820
as many social animals on earth,
our nuclear war,
genetic engineering gone wrong.

717
00:40:36.821 --> 00:40:40.240
Things of that nature may be an inevitability for the great majority of

718
00:40:40.241 --> 00:40:44.140
civilizations they can't escape from,
which eventually leads to their doom.

719
00:40:44.380 --> 00:40:48.640
Number four,
the vastness of space is too great for us to have heard anything.

720
00:40:48.820 --> 00:40:52.270
Civilizations may indeed be out there,
possibly plentiful,

721
00:40:52.420 --> 00:40:53.830
but they're so far apart.

722
00:40:53.860 --> 00:40:58.000
The contact is actually rare and possibly there is some sort of problem with

723
00:40:58.001 --> 00:41:01.450
interstellar space travel that we're just missing.
We are,
after all,

724
00:41:01.480 --> 00:41:05.380
just beginning to deal with that.
These are all worth considering,

725
00:41:05.381 --> 00:41:07.960
but keep in mind,
1 billion years ago,

726
00:41:07.961 --> 00:41:12.490
if there were only just one single civilization around in the galaxy that beat

727
00:41:12.491 --> 00:41:15.250
these odds by now,
they would have been capable.

728
00:41:15.400 --> 00:41:19.000
If they followed the line of progression we'd expect of having dominated the

729
00:41:19.001 --> 00:41:22.390
whole galaxy by now.
These hypotheses are worth considering,

730
00:41:22.420 --> 00:41:24.880
but they're not my personal favorites for that reason.

731
00:41:25.150 --> 00:41:27.670
Thankfully there are many other factors to consider too.

732
00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:32.320
Five aliens are just too alien.
I didn't give a specific scenario,

733
00:41:32.321 --> 00:41:36.230
but I've discussed this video how intelligent aliens might think so differently

734
00:41:36.231 --> 00:41:38.570
from us so they don't go on to develop civilization.

735
00:41:38.571 --> 00:41:41.690
As we understand that we might all be very different from each other.

736
00:41:41.720 --> 00:41:43.100
Much of what we are as humans,

737
00:41:43.101 --> 00:41:47.210
our curiosity and desire for contact and to understand ourselves and things like

738
00:41:47.211 --> 00:41:49.370
that are genetically evolved traits,

739
00:41:49.371 --> 00:41:53.720
which not all aliens might express or share in the same way.
Of course,

740
00:41:53.750 --> 00:41:55.340
some aliens would want to talk,

741
00:41:55.341 --> 00:41:58.370
but it's worth considering that there are some who don't want to talk,

742
00:41:58.490 --> 00:42:03.230
some who are Zena phobic and afraid to talk and some who wouldn't understand or

743
00:42:03.231 --> 00:42:06.920
even notice one of our messages and vice versa.
Even if they did talk,

744
00:42:07.460 --> 00:42:11.780
we often underestimate just how different aliens might be.
Number six,

745
00:42:11.810 --> 00:42:16.280
they're not communicating using our means of communication anymore compared to

746
00:42:16.281 --> 00:42:19.160
their level of technology.
Our technology may have looked at them.

747
00:42:19.161 --> 00:42:22.220
How homo erectus sharpening rocks looks to us.

748
00:42:22.400 --> 00:42:26.390
The idea that they would still be communicating as we do across interstellar

749
00:42:26.391 --> 00:42:29.990
space at that may be a bit far fetched.
Number seven,

750
00:42:30.170 --> 00:42:34.040
surely someone would have heard something that we've sent though it's dubious

751
00:42:34.041 --> 00:42:37.250
that everyone everywhere gives up entirely on radio signals,

752
00:42:37.251 --> 00:42:39.350
especially knowing that they use them in the past.

753
00:42:40.010 --> 00:42:44.150
So this brings me to something which I consider it to be very likely,

754
00:42:44.330 --> 00:42:46.820
often commonly called the zoo hypothesis.

755
00:42:47.390 --> 00:42:51.650
Not that earth is one giant zoo for super advanced aliens to secretly visit.

756
00:42:51.710 --> 00:42:52.820
It's possible,

757
00:42:53.300 --> 00:42:56.810
but this refers more to something like the prime directive on Star Trek.

758
00:42:57.470 --> 00:43:01.220
Aliens may be fully aware of our existence,
then may know all about us,

759
00:43:01.250 --> 00:43:05.840
but they may a be waiting for us to meet certain technological,
social,

760
00:43:05.841 --> 00:43:06.680
ethical,
political,

761
00:43:06.681 --> 00:43:10.100
whatever criteria before they contact us so that they don't disrupt the natural

762
00:43:10.101 --> 00:43:12.230
progression of our civilization.
Or B,

763
00:43:12.231 --> 00:43:16.010
there's so advanced that they don't care about us to an ancient,

764
00:43:16.011 --> 00:43:19.040
powerful civilization that has traversed the galaxy.

765
00:43:19.160 --> 00:43:22.970
Earth may not be the most interesting thing to them and they may view us how we

766
00:43:22.971 --> 00:43:25.940
view ants.
These are all excellent hypotheses,

767
00:43:25.941 --> 00:43:29.390
but I myself tend to lean towards the last two,
which I mentioned though.

768
00:43:29.391 --> 00:43:33.050
For some reason many scientists did not.
Most scientists,

769
00:43:33.110 --> 00:43:34.250
popular scientists I believe,

770
00:43:34.251 --> 00:43:36.530
haven't really examined the depth of the question though,

771
00:43:36.531 --> 00:43:40.160
and I would even say that most scientists are probably wrong about aliens in

772
00:43:40.161 --> 00:43:43.540
this regard and that there is an obvious answer to the Fermi paradox.

773
00:43:43.541 --> 00:43:45.950
It is not discussed nearly enough as it should be.

774
00:43:46.220 --> 00:43:50.150
It goes in line with the last hypothesis there,
but it goes beyond that.

775
00:43:50.390 --> 00:43:53.870
I wouldn't make a claim that sounds as arrogant as that without a rationale

776
00:43:53.871 --> 00:43:56.870
behind it.
It isn't as arrogant as it seems.

777
00:43:56.870 --> 00:43:59.300
It's actually an admission of humility.

778
00:43:59.870 --> 00:44:03.500
I am under the impression that we're bragging about how we think aliens progress

779
00:44:03.620 --> 00:44:04.453
right now.

780
00:44:04.460 --> 00:44:08.760
A very common tool in this field that we use is something called the Carter Chef

781
00:44:08.761 --> 00:44:09.440
scale.

782
00:44:09.440 --> 00:44:14.440
It ranks civilizations from type zero type one to type two to type three and

783
00:44:14.841 --> 00:44:19.760
even in some circumstances beyond that to type four and type five a type one

784
00:44:19.761 --> 00:44:23.450
civilization has mastery over its entire planet or a moon.

785
00:44:24.110 --> 00:44:26.810
It can control the weather,
it can prevent earthquakes,

786
00:44:26.870 --> 00:44:30.380
it can harness all of the energy that it's home planet provides.

787
00:44:30.530 --> 00:44:34.260
Type two civilizations have mastery over their entire solar system.

788
00:44:34.440 --> 00:44:37.380
Type three have mastery over an entire galaxy.

789
00:44:37.530 --> 00:44:41.370
I typed for a civilization has mastery over the entire universe and a type five

790
00:44:41.371 --> 00:44:46.230
civilization mastery over large areas of or the entire multi-verse,

791
00:44:46.260 --> 00:44:48.090
which is a lot of power.

792
00:44:48.210 --> 00:44:52.110
It's generally accepted that civilizations progressed to these ranks over the,

793
00:44:52.350 --> 00:44:54.570
over the course of thousands,
then millions,

794
00:44:54.571 --> 00:44:57.060
then maybe billions of years slowly evolving.

795
00:44:57.210 --> 00:44:59.640
I see a problem with a cutter chef scale though.

796
00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:03.510
My problem with the Kardashian scale is that it's predicting the societal

797
00:45:03.511 --> 00:45:07.350
evolution of aliens about whom we know nothing to begin with at rates of

798
00:45:07.351 --> 00:45:09.840
technology billions of years ahead of us.

799
00:45:09.990 --> 00:45:14.460
I can't help but refer back to the fact that people in the year 1900 who are

800
00:45:14.461 --> 00:45:18.330
asked to predict the year 2000 gave predictions that we'd all be flying around

801
00:45:18.331 --> 00:45:22.350
on wings and machines would meet directly transmitting knowledge into our brains

802
00:45:22.351 --> 00:45:23.190
and things like that.

803
00:45:23.280 --> 00:45:27.420
Ask a caveman what he thinks of the year 2000 would be like how humanity would

804
00:45:27.421 --> 00:45:31.230
have progressed as it evolves and he probably wouldn't give you the right
answer.

805
00:45:31.860 --> 00:45:33.000
That's a fair criticism,

806
00:45:33.001 --> 00:45:36.630
but I would go even deeper than that because it's even more widely assumed that

807
00:45:36.631 --> 00:45:41.160
aliens advance and evolve at a gradual rate similar to the rate of development

808
00:45:41.161 --> 00:45:45.030
that we have thus far experience.
I don't think that even that is true.

809
00:45:45.031 --> 00:45:46.800
That's where I differ with common belief.

810
00:45:47.100 --> 00:45:51.360
I've talked about this as a central point in the video.
We are the last humans.

811
00:45:51.630 --> 00:45:56.130
In that video I discuss the predicted course of genetic engineering and beyond

812
00:45:56.131 --> 00:45:59.070
that artificial intelligence,
humans,

813
00:45:59.071 --> 00:46:03.150
I caution in that video are on the verge of not only taking our evolution into

814
00:46:03.151 --> 00:46:05.070
our own hands with the field of genetics,

815
00:46:05.310 --> 00:46:09.900
but more crucially are on the verge of creating intelligent machines which can

816
00:46:09.901 --> 00:46:14.250
improve themselves over generations become smarter and smarter and smarter until

817
00:46:14.251 --> 00:46:19.140
suddenly someone builds computers as smart as humans capable of improving

818
00:46:19.141 --> 00:46:21.540
themselves with no known limits.
Beyond that,

819
00:46:21.750 --> 00:46:25.290
I didn't bother to examine the dynamic of robot apocalypse in that video.

820
00:46:25.291 --> 00:46:28.170
I don't really care too.
It was beside the point I was trying to make.

821
00:46:28.200 --> 00:46:33.200
The point I was trying to make was human civilization has progressed in terms of

822
00:46:33.241 --> 00:46:35.340
discovering new science technology,

823
00:46:35.341 --> 00:46:39.960
reforming our society at the pace it has because of the speed of the human
brain,

824
00:46:39.961 --> 00:46:41.370
for lack of a better term,

825
00:46:41.610 --> 00:46:45.150
the geniuses among us people we consider not only to think faster and more

826
00:46:45.151 --> 00:46:49.440
broadly,
but in fact differently from the average sometimes take aspects of our

827
00:46:49.441 --> 00:46:52.050
development into their own hands and speed of development up.

828
00:46:52.290 --> 00:46:56.210
What we are on the brink of doing with artificial intelligence is constructing a

829
00:46:56.211 --> 00:47:00.480
mortal geniuses without the drawbacks of our biological brains who may advance

830
00:47:00.481 --> 00:47:04.350
far beyond human intellect.
There may be a limit to how smart AI could be.

831
00:47:04.351 --> 00:47:05.280
No one really knows,

832
00:47:05.700 --> 00:47:08.760
but there's no reason to think it's within a human limitation.

833
00:47:09.240 --> 00:47:12.060
Certainly they will not think like humans though either way,

834
00:47:12.090 --> 00:47:16.710
what happens after we create a super computer of that magnitude?
Who knows?

835
00:47:17.370 --> 00:47:21.240
At some point we may have machines giving us the instruction is to eliminate

836
00:47:21.241 --> 00:47:23.070
death to travel interstellar space.

837
00:47:23.340 --> 00:47:26.520
The most ideal way to organize our society beyond that,

838
00:47:26.521 --> 00:47:30.310
far beyond that even laying out would have taken thousands of years without

839
00:47:30.311 --> 00:47:32.410
enhanced helped and just a matter of years.

840
00:47:32.810 --> 00:47:34.870
This isn't something for the far off future.

841
00:47:34.871 --> 00:47:37.900
I believe it's something which will happen within the next few hundred years.

842
00:47:38.050 --> 00:47:41.290
Hence,
you know the provocative title.
We are the last humans.

843
00:47:41.860 --> 00:47:45.670
It won't really help to make it illegal.
Someone in some underground layer,

844
00:47:45.671 --> 00:47:48.070
we'll do it if the officials are forbidden from doing it.

845
00:47:48.071 --> 00:47:52.030
The only alternative to such an event is a global pledge to live somewhat like

846
00:47:52.031 --> 00:47:55.270
the Amish.
I can't say how many people will follow through with that.

847
00:47:55.271 --> 00:47:58.690
It's impossible to say what happens after we develop a kind of technology.

848
00:47:58.900 --> 00:48:01.600
Why is this relevant?
Well,
for obvious reasons,

849
00:48:01.601 --> 00:48:05.410
I believe all civilizations which follow a pattern remotely similar to ours

850
00:48:05.411 --> 00:48:09.010
eventually reached this point of having ultimate knowledge placed in front of

851
00:48:09.011 --> 00:48:11.440
them from the fruits of their technology and progress.

852
00:48:11.680 --> 00:48:15.340
Perhaps it's too tempting for them to resist and considering this development

853
00:48:15.341 --> 00:48:19.060
takes place within a few hundred years of their ability to broadcast messages in

854
00:48:19.061 --> 00:48:20.650
this space.
Theoretically anyway,

855
00:48:21.070 --> 00:48:25.450
they may only be detectable for a very short span of time before they shoot and

856
00:48:25.451 --> 00:48:27.490
evolve into something unrecognizable,

857
00:48:27.491 --> 00:48:31.390
possibly combining their own minds with their advanced artificial intelligence,

858
00:48:31.480 --> 00:48:34.060
achieving a completely new level of existence.

859
00:48:34.060 --> 00:48:38.680
Definitely not conforming to expectations and probably not very interested in
us.

860
00:48:38.980 --> 00:48:42.790
This may be the point which exit shows are waiting for us to reach before they

861
00:48:42.791 --> 00:48:43.810
initiate contact.

862
00:48:43.811 --> 00:48:48.040
Plus they may have evolved into something so complex that they're uninterested

863
00:48:48.041 --> 00:48:51.760
in contact altogether.
Something which we don't quite understand yet.

864
00:48:51.850 --> 00:48:54.190
I won't make predictions as to what this might be like.

865
00:48:54.191 --> 00:48:57.010
That may very well be worse than a caveman predicting a year,

866
00:48:57.011 --> 00:49:00.310
2017 but I will say that with our current model,

867
00:49:00.311 --> 00:49:04.150
we predict alien civilizations to develop something like Dyson spheres,

868
00:49:04.180 --> 00:49:07.740
which are basically super advanced structures which surrounds star together as

869
00:49:07.760 --> 00:49:10.360
entire energy output and things like that.

870
00:49:11.020 --> 00:49:14.610
But Scientific American published an article in 2015 called aliens.

871
00:49:14.611 --> 00:49:18.520
Super Civilizations Absent from 100,000 nearby galaxies.

872
00:49:18.940 --> 00:49:21.820
We've looked for Dyson spheres.
We didn't find them.

873
00:49:22.570 --> 00:49:27.250
We've been listening for radio broadcast for 70 years or so.
We've heard nothing.

874
00:49:27.940 --> 00:49:32.200
Our messages have been out in space for almost a hundred years.
No response.

875
00:49:32.650 --> 00:49:34.570
The theory is worth considering.

876
00:49:34.870 --> 00:49:38.440
It's somewhat relates back to the theory that aliens destroy themselves once

877
00:49:38.441 --> 00:49:42.100
they reach our level of civilization and a little events around the level of

878
00:49:42.101 --> 00:49:45.460
where they would be on the Carter shut scale at a type one civilization.

879
00:49:45.910 --> 00:49:48.700
I don't believe that destroy themselves.
Though.
On the contrary,

880
00:49:48.701 --> 00:49:52.870
I believe they take off into an incredible development in an unrecognizable and

881
00:49:52.871 --> 00:49:53.980
unpredictable manner.

882
00:49:54.070 --> 00:49:58.030
So it is in this model that we are forced to conclude that we may not meet

883
00:49:58.031 --> 00:50:01.750
extraterrestrial civilization before we reached this point of development

884
00:50:01.751 --> 00:50:02.584
ourselves.

885
00:50:02.890 --> 00:50:07.890
The majority are frankly at or level below us or in all likelihood aware of us

886
00:50:08.351 --> 00:50:10.420
and intentionally not communicating with us.

887
00:50:10.450 --> 00:50:13.660
We may of course find extraterrestrial life within that time span.

888
00:50:13.690 --> 00:50:17.650
It might be within our own backyard on Mars or Europa or something like that,

889
00:50:17.890 --> 00:50:19.660
but as unfortunate as it sounds,

890
00:50:19.661 --> 00:50:24.661
we may never talk to aliens until we are on an on a very advanced level already

891
00:50:24.910 --> 00:50:29.180
unless we happen upon a very chance and find a civilization at or level or

892
00:50:29.181 --> 00:50:33.020
catching up to us within 10 or 20 light years.
Therefore,

893
00:50:33.021 --> 00:50:37.190
the most important answered the question,
what will aliens be like?
I'll be it.

894
00:50:37.191 --> 00:50:41.090
A bit of a depressing answer for those of us who were hoping for a slow Sci-fi

895
00:50:41.160 --> 00:50:44.810
development is a sort of bio robotic race of gods,

896
00:50:45.260 --> 00:50:49.280
which in the end might be probably the best decision that such as civilization

897
00:50:49.281 --> 00:50:50.930
could make and pretty cool.

898
00:50:51.470 --> 00:50:56.470
It's depressing because we humans desire a challenge and a struggle to overcome

899
00:50:56.961 --> 00:51:00.230
for ourselves.
We desire an exciting story.

00:51:00.231 --> 00:51:02.000
Whenever we mentioned the prospect of alien life,

901
00:51:02.001 --> 00:51:05.510
we expect our civilization to evolve gradually and face constantly new

902
00:51:05.511 --> 00:51:09.260
adventures and struggles in ideas and concepts and things like that.

903
00:51:09.500 --> 00:51:10.580
In reality though,

904
00:51:10.581 --> 00:51:14.240
if this is indeed the chorus which extraterrestrial civilizations take and the

905
00:51:14.241 --> 00:51:16.400
one that we are destined to take as well,

906
00:51:16.520 --> 00:51:20.570
there will be no greater challenge and the one our species will face in dealing

907
00:51:20.571 --> 00:51:23.750
with this technology wisely,
fairly and responsibly,

908
00:51:24.170 --> 00:51:27.830
and no greater prospects for a good story than venturing into the complete

909
00:51:27.890 --> 00:51:29.270
unknown and unpredictable.

910
00:51:29.450 --> 00:51:33.320
So now let's go over the hypotheses I've laid out in this video.

911
00:51:33.890 --> 00:51:37.820
We've established quite a bit for people who have never met anyone off our own

912
00:51:37.821 --> 00:51:38.271
planet,

913
00:51:38.271 --> 00:51:41.960
and it's worth considering that every hypothesis we've made could be wrong

914
00:51:42.170 --> 00:51:46.700
either in a certain manner of speaking or just flat out entirely wrong.
However,

915
00:51:46.701 --> 00:51:49.460
given our current understanding of our universe,

916
00:51:49.490 --> 00:51:53.540
these hypotheses are in accordance with scientific information and what I

917
00:51:53.541 --> 00:51:57.800
believe to be logical thought.
Here they are again listed numerically.

918
00:51:57.980 --> 00:52:02.600
Number one,
intelligent extra terrestrials will likely require a star for energy.

919
00:52:03.020 --> 00:52:03.853
Number two,

920
00:52:04.040 --> 00:52:08.030
the sheer abundance as well as the biological effectiveness of carbon and water

921
00:52:08.031 --> 00:52:10.730
throughout the university.
Just at the majority of intelligent I had.

922
00:52:10.750 --> 00:52:14.960
Rush shows have similar chemical makeup to humans and evolve on similar rocky

923
00:52:14.961 --> 00:52:18.560
worlds around their stars habitable zone number three,

924
00:52:18.620 --> 00:52:22.430
the worlds from which intelligent beings originate likely have magnetic fields

925
00:52:22.431 --> 00:52:25.070
comparable to the earth and accordingly play tectonics.

926
00:52:25.400 --> 00:52:28.100
Number four their worlds are likely to have conditions,

927
00:52:28.101 --> 00:52:31.580
would prevent mass extinctions from occurring too commonly such as nearby gas

928
00:52:31.581 --> 00:52:34.460
giants and significant distance from volatiles.
Stars.

929
00:52:34.910 --> 00:52:39.860
Number five intelligent exa treasures likely are or originated as carnivores or

930
00:52:39.861 --> 00:52:43.490
omnivores who evolved in an environment which are turbulent and unpredictable

931
00:52:43.491 --> 00:52:46.490
and therefore have an evolutionary pressure placed on them to evolve.

932
00:52:46.491 --> 00:52:48.110
Intelligence.
Number six,

933
00:52:48.140 --> 00:52:51.680
all life evolves and response to their environment and while they and their

934
00:52:51.681 --> 00:52:55.280
environments maybe different similar structures and survival strategies such as

935
00:52:55.281 --> 00:52:56.720
vision,
photosynthesis,

936
00:52:56.721 --> 00:53:00.680
and multicellular life in general are prevalent throughout and how it had
worlds.

937
00:53:00.800 --> 00:53:04.310
Traits which may be utilized in various environments and have evolved

938
00:53:04.311 --> 00:53:07.880
independently numerous times on earth are the most likely to be found commonly

939
00:53:07.881 --> 00:53:09.650
throughout the universe.
Furthermore,

940
00:53:09.710 --> 00:53:12.860
the more like the environment of an extra planet is the earth,

941
00:53:12.861 --> 00:53:16.580
the more similarly intelligent extraterrestrials may evolve in order to survive

942
00:53:16.581 --> 00:53:17.870
within it.
Number seven,

943
00:53:17.871 --> 00:53:21.650
intelligence extraterrestrials likely have some sort of social cooperation in

944
00:53:21.651 --> 00:53:24.050
order to exchange ideas,
work for mutual benefit,

945
00:53:24.051 --> 00:53:26.790
and safeguard their knowledge by communicating it to their offspring.

946
00:53:26.940 --> 00:53:30.630
Each a requisite of what we consider civilization to reach it.
Civilization,

947
00:53:30.631 --> 00:53:31.500
as we understand it,

948
00:53:31.501 --> 00:53:35.280
the brains of these extra trash shows must be curious and Aveda and capable of

949
00:53:35.281 --> 00:53:38.880
things such as generating abstractions.
Number eight,
intelligence.

950
00:53:38.881 --> 00:53:41.980
Extraterrestrials may only develop civilization if they have the means to

951
00:53:41.981 --> 00:53:43.710
manipulate the environment around them.

952
00:53:43.860 --> 00:53:47.620
Having a brain geared toward creativity and innovation are as necessary as

953
00:53:47.621 --> 00:53:51.240
developed civilization as a superficial biological structures required to do so,

954
00:53:51.270 --> 00:53:54.420
such as precise,
manipulative digits.
Number nine,

955
00:53:54.421 --> 00:53:58.140
intelligent extra shows may only develop civilization if the environment in

956
00:53:58.141 --> 00:54:01.560
which they exist may be manipulated it thus excluding gas giants and

957
00:54:01.561 --> 00:54:03.660
Panthalassic or ocean worlds.

958
00:54:03.840 --> 00:54:07.680
Number 10 extraterrestrial civilizations which avoids self destruction and

959
00:54:07.681 --> 00:54:11.280
follow even remotely similar path of technological and scientific development

960
00:54:11.281 --> 00:54:15.180
that humanity has will eventually reach a point of capability at which they're

961
00:54:15.181 --> 00:54:18.540
able to take not only their biology and evolution into their own hands,

962
00:54:18.990 --> 00:54:22.800
but to build artificial intelligence capable of improving itself to reach points

963
00:54:22.801 --> 00:54:24.150
far beyond those of its creators,

964
00:54:24.151 --> 00:54:26.790
which the aliens may indeed utilize in its entirety.

965
00:54:27.480 --> 00:54:30.720
Such technology would allow for rapid advancement beyond current human

966
00:54:30.721 --> 00:54:33.810
understanding and because this development would occur not long after they have

967
00:54:33.811 --> 00:54:37.350
developed a technology to communicate with other civilizations in the galaxy,

968
00:54:37.500 --> 00:54:41.370
there may only be a period of a few hundred years in which civilizations are

969
00:54:41.371 --> 00:54:44.970
capable of communication before they reach a point of rapid advancement.

970
00:54:45.180 --> 00:54:49.200
Such advancement may very well lead to disinterest in civilization such as those

971
00:54:49.201 --> 00:54:49.981
at a current level,

972
00:54:49.981 --> 00:54:53.280
or at least a desire to not interfere with their progression until they reached

973
00:54:53.281 --> 00:54:56.700
the same limit naturally.
And so that's all I have for you today.

974
00:54:56.790 --> 00:55:00.150
Let me know what you think of all this in the comment section below and let me

975
00:55:00.151 --> 00:55:03.510
know what kinds of things you might expect to see from aliens out there as well.

976
00:55:04.140 --> 00:55:06.360
From what videos like this and videos on many other subjects,

977
00:55:06.361 --> 00:55:08.520
we should have checked out.
Fire of learning and subscribe.

978
00:55:08.670 --> 00:55:09.630
Thank you for watching.
