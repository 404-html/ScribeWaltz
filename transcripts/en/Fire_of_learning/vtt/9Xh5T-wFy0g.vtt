Hello and welcome to fire of learning.

2
00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:06.000
Perhaps you've heard that dogs are colorblind.

3
00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:11.010
Now they can only see in black and white.
Well,
believe it or not,
that's not true.

4
00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:16.760
Dogs are actually capable of seeing in color and today Winston here and I are

5
00:00:17.341 --> 00:00:21.660
teamed up to per of that to you Winston's about to do what he's been trained to

6
00:00:21.661 --> 00:00:24.990
do for about a month.
Now,
over the past month,

7
00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:29.280
Winston has learned that when I say blue and he puts his paw on a blue piece of

8
00:00:29.281 --> 00:00:33.840
paper,
he receives a treat that doesn't sound too complicated.

9
00:00:33.841 --> 00:00:37.440
However,
if he were incapable of perceiving color,

10
00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.970
he'd have a very hard time distinguishing between a light blue and a light

11
00:00:41.971 --> 00:00:46.680
yellow.
For example,
today we'll see how he does and when we're done.

12
00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.410
I'll explain why I chose the colors.
Blue and yellow.

13
00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:05.973
<v 1>Woo.</v>

14
00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:14.680
<v 0>As you can see,
Winston is getting it.
He's recognizing the correct color.</v>

15
00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:18.880
Even when we substitute the colors for dark blue and orange,

16
00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:22.000
he is still capable of distinguishing the colors.

17
00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:25.180
Even when we add in black and white,
he still goes for the blue.

18
00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:30.480
Does this suggest that Winston does in fact see the colors and is not completely

19
00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:34.690
colorblind.
This is a course not the first time this has been done.

20
00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:38.950
Scientists have been performing experiments and studies on things like this for

21
00:01:38.951 --> 00:01:43.210
decades,
which thankfully saves them the trouble of making some rookie mistakes.

22
00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:46.960
Winston can see this blue and yellow like I can,

23
00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:51.190
but he and I don't see the world the same way compared to me.

24
00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:55.240
Winston is a little color blind.
If I had chosen,
for example,

25
00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:56.440
red and green,

26
00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:00.730
Winston wouldn't be able to correctly distinguish it to this same way I do.

27
00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:06.130
He would probably see them both as a kind of dark,
brownish yellow.
Why?

28
00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:10.330
Well I along with all other non colorblind humans,

29
00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:15.390
many species of primates and some other organisms in facts and may try Chromat

30
00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:20.320
Winston along with other dogs walls and most mammals is a dye Chromat.

31
00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:21.850
What does that mean?

32
00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:27.010
It means that I have three different kinds of cone cells and my eyes while a

33
00:02:27.011 --> 00:02:32.011
Winston has just to cone cells or just cones are the type of photo receptors

34
00:02:32.951 --> 00:02:35.170
cells which allow us to see colors.

35
00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:39.700
Each type of cone and a human's eye is responsible for detecting a certain

36
00:02:39.701 --> 00:02:43.840
wavelength of light,
which correlates to a specific set of colors.

37
00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:45.610
Humans have blue,

38
00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:50.620
green and red cones and these combine to create the many kinds of colors we are

39
00:02:50.621 --> 00:02:55.180
capable of seeing.
Dogs,
however,
only have two sets,
as I said,

40
00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:56.890
a blue and a yellow.

41
00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:00.250
The yellow is structurally in between human rat and green,

42
00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:04.300
which allows them to see blue,
yellow,
and of course white,
gray and black,

43
00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:07.270
but not much outside that range very well.

44
00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:10.660
Our color spectrum looks like this,

45
00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:13.510
but a dog's looks more like this.

46
00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:18.070
Humans furthermore have 10 times the cone receptors that dogs do on average

47
00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:22.840
depending on where you draw the line between a shade of an individual color and

48
00:03:22.841 --> 00:03:23.740
a separate color,

49
00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:28.150
humans are capable of seeing an average of 1 million colors.

50
00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:30.550
Some individuals,
mostly men.

51
00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:35.050
Those with a type of colorblindness are capable of seeing less and some humans,

52
00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:38.830
mostly women with an extra type of cone can see even more,

53
00:03:38.831 --> 00:03:40.840
perhaps even 10 times more.

54
00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:45.160
The latter group fit the definition of a Tetra chromatic and they account for

55
00:03:45.161 --> 00:03:47.380
about 1% of the population,

56
00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:52.420
not the 25% that you may have seen from these classic clickbait articles.

57
00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:57.600
The average dog in comparison to all this is capable of seeing only about 10,000

58
00:03:57.731 --> 00:03:58.540
colors.

59
00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:03.280
There are some humans with a kind of red green colorblindness called Protopia

60
00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:05.230
that allows them to see the world.

61
00:04:05.231 --> 00:04:10.231
Much like dogs do protein nopes account for about 1% of the population.

62
00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:15.460
The reason for the difference between human and dog color perception is simple.

63
00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:17.920
Nature is very frugal.

64
00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:23.380
The ancestors of humans and many other primates needed to have the ability to

65
00:04:23.381 --> 00:04:26.980
distinguish and many types of colors because of our diverse diet.

66
00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:29.020
Just look for example,

67
00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:33.640
at the variety of colors that fruits and vegetables can be our ability to see a

68
00:04:33.641 --> 00:04:36.640
wide array of colors more than most mammals,
in fact,

69
00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.950
helped us find where food was and helped us distinguish whether or not that food

70
00:04:41.951 --> 00:04:45.040
was good to eat.
Dogs on the other hand,

71
00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:47.920
have a more straight forward diet dogs,

72
00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:51.760
much like their wolf ancestors are primarily carnivores,

73
00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:54.070
although they are more omnivorous in walls,

74
00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:59.250
diverse color perception simply is it necessary to catch a deer or a rabbit so

75
00:04:59.471 --> 00:05:03.580
it's simply never evolved.
While it may seem unfortunate,

76
00:05:03.581 --> 00:05:07.300
that dog's likely ability to distinguish colors that many humans do.

77
00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:12.340
They do have us beat and many other fields through the combination of more rods

78
00:05:12.341 --> 00:05:14.680
than humans.
Larger pupils and a tap,

79
00:05:14.681 --> 00:05:18.910
a tem or a tap pay to him look Edam Latin for illuminated carpet.

80
00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:22.570
They're able to see in the dark five times better than humans can.

81
00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:26.230
The tap a tem is also what makes their eyes glow and pictures.
By the way,

82
00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:30.370
they also have a larger field of vision and are much better at tracking motion.

83
00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:31.360
Furthermore,

84
00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:35.500
there are more advanced and their other senses such as smell and hearing.

85
00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:40.510
Whereas humans may only be able to smell with seems like a few distinct smells.

86
00:05:40.511 --> 00:05:42.670
I'm a forest food or a house.

87
00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:47.790
Dogs are able to distinguish many individual smells very easily comparable to

88
00:05:48.431 --> 00:05:51.490
our difference in color vision.
With all this in mind,

89
00:05:51.491 --> 00:05:55.720
it's interesting to point out that technology will actually soon allow us

90
00:05:55.810 --> 00:06:00.680
through gene therapy or genetic engineering to give dogs the color vision that

91
00:06:00.681 --> 00:06:03.980
we humans have or perhaps enhance our vision as well.

92
00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:06.320
No one has yet done this,
of course,

93
00:06:06.321 --> 00:06:11.321
but perhaps some day someone will to support the creation of more videos like

94
00:06:11.451 --> 00:06:15.140
these,
a link to our patriotic we found in the video description,

95
00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:18.980
any donation would be appreciated and be put to use to improve the channel.

96
00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:22.010
