00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:04.080
Hello and welcome.
In this video we're going to talk about 10 English words.

2
00:00:04.081 --> 00:00:07.050
It didn't exactly quite make the cut into modern English.

3
00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:10.980
Should they be brought back?
You tell me,
but for now here they are.

4
00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.250
So the first one we have is cumber.
The word incomers still exists,

5
00:00:15.251 --> 00:00:17.400
but not the Anglo sex in route to cumber,

6
00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:21.360
which can be used as a verb or a noun relating to something which causes
trouble.

7
00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:26.700
Next we have Callen.
Sure.
From the Latin word Kaleo meaning heat.

8
00:00:26.701 --> 00:00:31.701
It refers to delirious behavior associated with intense heat as it is now

9
00:00:31.771 --> 00:00:34.410
September where I live,
we don't really have this problem,

10
00:00:34.411 --> 00:00:38.370
but over the summer it's definitely possible to some people separate from some

11
00:00:38.371 --> 00:00:42.450
calendar or delirious behavior associated with heat.
Next,

12
00:00:42.451 --> 00:00:46.170
we have the word cross tid,
which may be a popular word among college students.

13
00:00:46.171 --> 00:00:49.170
I there were first with time in which one consumes alcohol,

14
00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.020
sort of like an extreme tee time.

15
00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.240
Next we have booth from the German word vote referring to someone who was

16
00:00:57.241 --> 00:01:01.680
extremely angry and potentially violent.
Similarly,

17
00:01:01.681 --> 00:01:05.310
capra lash is a word referring to abusive or harmful language,

18
00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.470
but can also be used to mean a disciplinary scolding or something similar in

19
00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:13.970
less extreme.
Next,
we have purposed,

20
00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:18.060
this word is an entirely gone from English.
It refers to limb,

21
00:01:18.061 --> 00:01:20.910
which can grow crops and produce food.
Good land.

22
00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:25.470
The word has become the modern word birth though in English and it was also

23
00:01:25.471 --> 00:01:29.860
related to the word harvest.
Next we have miss [inaudible].

24
00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:32.460
This is a French word actually from Ms. Paul.

25
00:01:32.461 --> 00:01:34.610
Write the word [inaudible] means to miss.

26
00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:38.460
Take or misunderstand just as it does in its French route.

27
00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:42.840
Next,
we have sanctify,
which means reduced blood.

28
00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:45.500
It comes from the Latin song with,

29
00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.680
but it has been replaced by the more modern term to just bleed,

30
00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:52.140
which the word blood is a dramatic word.

31
00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.730
Next sofar [inaudible] are medicines that have been used to treat headaches.

32
00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.080
Today we use painkillers still for headaches though,
not under this name,

33
00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.880
and certainly not in the ways that they used to treat headaches such as bearing

34
00:02:05.881 --> 00:02:09.930
the hair from your haircut as if that would surely stop a headache.

35
00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.960
And finally we have the word English and bone,

36
00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.610
which means capable of being either translated or made a part of the English

37
00:02:17.611 --> 00:02:22.560
language.
Similarly,
another name for a translator was an English a fire.

38
00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:26.820
These words are once English a bowl.
Can they be,
again,

39
00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:32.130
let me know in the comments section below.
