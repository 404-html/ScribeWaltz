1
00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:04.590
We left off in the last video is King James is six and the first the same
person,

2
00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:08.310
but the monarch.
Importantly of two countries,
England and Scotland.

3
00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:11.120
Two very important things happened during the royal of James.

4
00:00:11.121 --> 00:00:13.740
The first for the first time,
as I said,
England,

5
00:00:13.741 --> 00:00:17.850
Scotland and Ireland are all undisputably ruled by the same monarch and what is

6
00:00:17.851 --> 00:00:20.120
called a union of Crowns.
Now,

7
00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.530
Scotland and England still our main separate countries,

8
00:00:22.531 --> 00:00:26.110
but they politically had the same king and this would ultimately foreshadow the

9
00:00:26.111 --> 00:00:28.800
coming of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland.

10
00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.530
Ireland had been capitulated prior to this during the reign of Henry to seven

11
00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.800
and this essentially secures for the first time England's perhaps 800 years

12
00:00:36.801 --> 00:00:39.120
struggle to dominate the British isles.
Secondly,

13
00:00:39.121 --> 00:00:40.980
with Spain defeated in the reign of Elizabeth.

14
00:00:40.981 --> 00:00:43.380
England has a path now to colonize the Americas.

15
00:00:43.381 --> 00:00:46.290
They set up to colony of James town named after,
believe it or not,

16
00:00:46.291 --> 00:00:47.940
King James in Modern Day Virginia,

17
00:00:47.941 --> 00:00:51.210
which becomes the first permanent English colony in North America.

18
00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.930
And somewhat further say the founding of Jamestown marks the beginning of the

19
00:00:54.931 --> 00:00:57.690
British empire,
which we'll see more of throughout this video.

20
00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.020
Religious conflicts continued throughout Europe and England.

21
00:01:01.021 --> 00:01:03.420
Three major assassination attempts were made on the king,

22
00:01:03.421 --> 00:01:06.270
including the famous gunpowder treason on the 5th of November,

23
00:01:06.271 --> 00:01:09.090
undertaken to place a Catholic monarch on the throne of England.

24
00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.480
But James would reign through what is called the Jacobean era.
We're in England,

25
00:01:12.481 --> 00:01:16.260
essentially laid the seeds for Northern Ireland via the plantation.

26
00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:17.430
Oh certain things like that.

27
00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:22.350
The Bible was translated into English as the King James Bible and King James led

28
00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.390
England during a turbulent period of English history.

29
00:01:24.391 --> 00:01:27.960
And on March 27 1625 when he died of a stroke,

30
00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.020
James had been openly bisexual and preferred men to women,

31
00:01:31.021 --> 00:01:34.530
but his position naturally put pressure on him to marry and produce an heir.

32
00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.770
He fell in love with an of Denmark and had three children with her.

33
00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.560
One of these children,
Charles succeeded him to the throne.

34
00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.850
Charles was thrown into intensifying religious disagreement and conflict in

35
00:01:44.851 --> 00:01:47.570
Europe and in England.
He ruled during the 30 years war.

36
00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:50.940
Europe's bloodiest religious conflict fought largely between Protestants and

37
00:01:50.941 --> 00:01:53.580
Catholics.
It would claim the lives of millions.

38
00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.880
The fact that Charles had attempted to force his Anglican religion on other

39
00:01:56.881 --> 00:01:58.350
emerging Protestant groups in England.

40
00:01:58.351 --> 00:02:01.470
The fact that he hadn't married a Catholic despite being an Anglican and the

41
00:02:01.471 --> 00:02:03.510
fact that he had promised his support militarily,

42
00:02:03.511 --> 00:02:05.310
the French against the Protestant rebels,

43
00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:09.360
then a ride and instead on successfully use ships to assist a Protestant rebels

44
00:02:09.361 --> 00:02:13.290
against the French at the siege of La Rochelle and his dissolution of parliament

45
00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:15.920
when they refuse to provide him with the power to raise taxes,

46
00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:19.440
created multiple conflicts for him,
which would eventually spiral out of control.

47
00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:22.530
As he attempted to bring his Anglican religious doctrine that Scotland,

48
00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.900
they resisted it starting what is called the bishop's,

49
00:02:24.901 --> 00:02:28.770
were seeing his religious conversion attempts in Scotland failing,

50
00:02:28.771 --> 00:02:32.370
which was in reality and attempt to further secure Scotland and England to a

51
00:02:32.371 --> 00:02:34.710
permanent union via religion and Washington.

52
00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:37.530
Scottish actually invade England in retaliation.

53
00:02:37.531 --> 00:02:41.010
Charles has said it to ask parliament for funds to support his armies.

54
00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:45.420
Parliaments being sympathetic actually to the Scottish concerns and with disdain

55
00:02:45.421 --> 00:02:47.370
for Charles.
His efforts refuses.

56
00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:50.850
Charles unhappy with this decision ordered parliament to be dissolved.

57
00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:54.020
Parliaments simply refuse to be dissolved following these disagreements or

58
00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:58.200
conflicts between royal and parliamentary authority in England lead to the

59
00:02:58.201 --> 00:03:01.150
English civil,
the English civil war,

60
00:03:01.151 --> 00:03:03.850
kind of like a hundred years where it wasn't just one big war.

61
00:03:03.851 --> 00:03:06.550
It's more commonly seen as three wars in one.

62
00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:10.450
The country divided between parliamentarians called the round heads who were

63
00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:14.230
largely supported by Protestants and common or as in like as opposed to the

64
00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:18.480
royalist it Cavaliers who were supported by of course an ability but also a

65
00:03:18.481 --> 00:03:21.250
catholic.
Seeing Charles as sympathetic to their interests.

66
00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:25.870
Leading the new model army of the parliamentarians was Lord Thomas Fairfax and

67
00:03:25.871 --> 00:03:28.210
Oliver Cromwell.
Two very important figures.

68
00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:33.360
The first two wars last from 1642 to 1649 the second one being finished with the

69
00:03:33.671 --> 00:03:35.640
battle of Preston,
which the parliamentarian,

70
00:03:35.641 --> 00:03:39.030
the one and King Charles there after became subject to that immense.

71
00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:43.000
Now in the past,
looking back at for example of something like King John,

72
00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:46.720
when rebel forces defeated the king or the aristocracy in general,

73
00:03:46.721 --> 00:03:50.590
often what followed was that they forced him to concede to their demands and it

74
00:03:50.591 --> 00:03:52.480
was definitely not smooth sailing from there,

75
00:03:52.481 --> 00:03:55.390
but the monarchy generally remained intact here.

76
00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:58.240
Parliament decides that maybe they don't need a king after all.

77
00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:00.700
They go so far as to put King Charles on trial,

78
00:04:00.701 --> 00:04:03.670
which had never been done before and they find him guilty of high treason and

79
00:04:03.671 --> 00:04:08.170
behead him.
On January 30th,
1649 following this parliament rules England,

80
00:04:08.171 --> 00:04:10.870
England becomes essentially a form of a republic.

81
00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:14.290
They formed the counsel of the state and they are immediately confronted by

82
00:04:14.291 --> 00:04:16.810
Charles.
His Song,
Charles is second trying to reclaim the power,

83
00:04:16.811 --> 00:04:19.000
which is the third phase of the English civil war.

84
00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:22.240
But in 1651 prominent wins again,
the Commonwealth of England,

85
00:04:22.241 --> 00:04:24.910
a Republican government uniting England,
Wales,
Scotland,

86
00:04:24.911 --> 00:04:28.450
and Ireland is truly formed parliament,
places of bounty on Charles his head,

87
00:04:28.451 --> 00:04:32.760
but he was successfully able to escape to Normandy in 1653 Oliver Cromwell was

88
00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:36.610
power grows and he takes on the title and the powers of Lord protector of the

89
00:04:36.611 --> 00:04:40.090
Commonwealth,
which was a position which as his critics of the day pointed out,

90
00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:41.320
made him king and all,

91
00:04:41.321 --> 00:04:44.980
but name Cranwell remains to this day a very controversial figure.

92
00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:48.820
He has remembered favorably for his actions on behalf of the common people

93
00:04:48.821 --> 00:04:52.930
ending Menargo power and moving England into a Republican oriented government,

94
00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:57.160
but unfavorably as well for the power he's Sim during his rural seen as a

95
00:04:57.161 --> 00:05:00.640
dictator responsible for pressing Catholics in killing thousands of innocent

96
00:05:00.641 --> 00:05:04.120
civilians most significantly in Ireland where he remains a hated figure.

97
00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:08.440
Cromwell would set his son Richard to be his successor who did in fact succeed

98
00:05:08.441 --> 00:05:12.550
him in 1658 the republic would not last long after this,

99
00:05:12.551 --> 00:05:15.970
that we would fall into instability marked by division and conflict.

100
00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:20.140
Two years later in 1660 they would invite Charleston second to return to England

101
00:05:20.141 --> 00:05:22.300
to rule as king and settled disputes.

102
00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:25.360
Charles agreed to part in many of those who had betrayed his father,

103
00:05:25.361 --> 00:05:29.590
but upon his return did execute around 50 people including post humorously

104
00:05:29.591 --> 00:05:31.480
beheading the body of Oliver Cromwell.

105
00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:35.590
Charles is second following the strict puritan rule of Chroma with referred to

106
00:05:35.591 --> 00:05:39.100
as in Merrie monarch being seen as having a more hedonistic lifestyle than its

107
00:05:39.101 --> 00:05:41.450
predecessor.
Though he favored religious tolerance,

108
00:05:41.451 --> 00:05:43.750
seeing what religious intolerance had done to this country,

109
00:05:43.751 --> 00:05:48.220
he agreed to the Clarendon code which encouraged submission to the Church of

110
00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:48.310
England.

111
00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:51.670
All the while England's colonies in North America continue to grow in England

112
00:05:51.671 --> 00:05:55.210
would claim territory in this time in Africa and near India as well.

113
00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:58.400
Despite his agreement to Clarendon Code.
Charles.

114
00:05:58.401 --> 00:06:01.820
A second toward the end of his reign was having Catholic leanings and in fact

115
00:06:01.821 --> 00:06:05.570
named a Catholic air.
England was divided over this issue.
Again,

116
00:06:05.571 --> 00:06:08.120
two sides rose up in the debate over the issue of succession.

117
00:06:08.121 --> 00:06:10.220
A group called the wigs demand at the James.

118
00:06:10.221 --> 00:06:14.210
His Catholic Aaron brothers should indeed be excluded from succession and the

119
00:06:14.211 --> 00:06:16.100
Tories believed that he should succeed him.

120
00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:19.010
Parliament was outrageous over Charles.
His decision,

121
00:06:19.011 --> 00:06:22.160
but much like his father Charles called together and dissolved parliament

122
00:06:22.161 --> 00:06:26.330
multiple times on his death bed.
On the 6th of February,

123
00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:29.420
1685 Charles converted to Catholicism and was succeeded by his brother.

124
00:06:29.421 --> 00:06:30.710
The Duke of York was open,

125
00:06:30.711 --> 00:06:34.350
the Catholic becoming James the second after facing conflicts in rebellion over

126
00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:36.950
Catholic air,
the English people breathe a sigh of relief.
Finally,

127
00:06:36.951 --> 00:06:40.010
as James is error was named to be his Protestant daughter Mary,

128
00:06:40.011 --> 00:06:43.040
who had married William of orange stockholder of the Netherlands.

129
00:06:43.130 --> 00:06:46.640
James changed his mind though and named his Catholic sun air to the sandwich.

130
00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:50.330
Quite naturally angered William and Mary William attempting to secure a

131
00:06:50.331 --> 00:06:52.820
succession as well as preventing an alliance with Louis.

132
00:06:52.821 --> 00:06:57.320
The 14th France who was expanding rapidly decided to invade England and James in

133
00:06:57.321 --> 00:07:00.650
his line were deposed in what is remembered as the glorious revolution.

134
00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:03.500
William the third and Mary,
the second pass the bill of rights,

135
00:07:03.501 --> 00:07:06.080
which guaranteed a number of rights to English citizens for granted,

136
00:07:06.081 --> 00:07:07.460
the return of an absolute monarchy,

137
00:07:07.461 --> 00:07:11.350
which many in England feared and also prevented a Catholic from becoming the

138
00:07:11.351 --> 00:07:12.320
monarch of England.

139
00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:15.980
The Catholics weren't finished with England yet though many English and
couldn't.

140
00:07:15.981 --> 00:07:19.190
The Jacobites would attempt to restore Catholic monarch on a throne leading to

141
00:07:19.191 --> 00:07:22.520
the Jacobite rebellions,
which would occur soon,
but later in English history,

142
00:07:22.850 --> 00:07:26.360
William was succeeded by queen and the first A.
Dot.
R James is second,

143
00:07:26.361 --> 00:07:28.190
but of course a protestant.

144
00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:30.920
It was under her rule that the acts of union had been passed,

145
00:07:30.921 --> 00:07:34.910
which essentially finally merge Scotland and England into a single nation before

146
00:07:34.911 --> 00:07:36.110
this,
for the past hundred years.

147
00:07:36.130 --> 00:07:39.200
Remember I had said that they were two nations with the same monarch after this,

148
00:07:39.201 --> 00:07:42.460
they were really politically one nation.
They merged on a deeper level,

149
00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:43.760
sharing not only a monarch,

150
00:07:43.761 --> 00:07:47.540
but the same parliament and altogether government and Queen and accordingly

151
00:07:47.541 --> 00:07:50.090
styles herself,
ruler of Great Britain and Ireland,

152
00:07:50.140 --> 00:07:53.780
and his reign was also marked by England moving toward a two party system.

153
00:07:54.050 --> 00:07:56.630
The wigs and the Tories,
which I,
which I mentioned earlier,

154
00:07:56.631 --> 00:07:59.150
as well as Britain's role and the Spanish war of succession,

155
00:07:59.151 --> 00:08:02.900
and an a dynastic conflict which lasted for 13 years and engulfed in much of

156
00:08:02.901 --> 00:08:05.240
Europe during this war.
England McGann,

157
00:08:05.241 --> 00:08:07.880
a territory of Gibraltar on a southern part of Spain,

158
00:08:07.881 --> 00:08:09.080
which it retains to this day.

159
00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:12.950
Also notable about this war in reference to England is that it was fought on

160
00:08:12.951 --> 00:08:15.710
multiple fronts in North America.
It was the same more,

161
00:08:15.711 --> 00:08:18.530
but it was referred to as Queen Anne's war.
Now,

162
00:08:18.531 --> 00:08:21.980
this is not the first time that England wasn't an international conflict

163
00:08:21.981 --> 00:08:22.930
involving its colonies,

164
00:08:22.940 --> 00:08:26.570
but it just goes to show that in this war and in fact in a significant number of

165
00:08:26.571 --> 00:08:28.310
England's of warrants for the next few hundred years,

166
00:08:28.370 --> 00:08:31.190
when England goes to war with another European nation especially,

167
00:08:31.191 --> 00:08:33.370
it's not always confined to just Europe.

168
00:08:33.380 --> 00:08:36.800
It means that war might break out in north and South America,

169
00:08:36.801 --> 00:08:39.650
in Asia and Africa across the ocean is essentially,

170
00:08:39.651 --> 00:08:42.320
these are now global conflicts.
Queen Anne,

171
00:08:42.321 --> 00:08:46.580
who had suffered from poor health from much of her life died in 1714 as the last

172
00:08:46.581 --> 00:08:47.414
two were at monarch.

173
00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:50.360
The wigs believe that parliament should choose the next English monarch when the

174
00:08:50.370 --> 00:08:52.940
Tories favor to hereditary role has it always had been.

175
00:08:53.030 --> 00:08:54.440
She was succeeded by George.

176
00:08:54.441 --> 00:08:58.020
The first was a lector of Hanover who began to Hannah Varian House.

177
00:08:58.080 --> 00:09:02.430
George was Ann's cousin who had the best claim technically to his throne with

178
00:09:02.431 --> 00:09:03.870
respect to English law at the time,

179
00:09:03.871 --> 00:09:05.940
meaning the large amount of potential Catholics.

180
00:09:05.941 --> 00:09:09.720
The assessors who had perhaps a better claim to the throne had no hope.
George,

181
00:09:09.721 --> 00:09:12.660
who did not even speak English,
did not possess much power.
In fact,

182
00:09:12.661 --> 00:09:13.321
during his reign,

183
00:09:13.321 --> 00:09:17.580
most political power would go to the rising position of prime minister held by

184
00:09:17.581 --> 00:09:19.230
Robert Walpole.
Accordingly,

185
00:09:19.231 --> 00:09:22.560
George would spend much of his time back in Hanover and with German figures of

186
00:09:22.561 --> 00:09:23.210
the day.

187
00:09:23.210 --> 00:09:26.610
Georgia successions sparked Jacobite rebellions and invasions from France as

188
00:09:26.611 --> 00:09:29.280
they would attempt to put to the center of the Stewart Line,

189
00:09:29.281 --> 00:09:30.960
James Edward Francis Stewart,

190
00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:34.320
whom they believed would what protects Catholic interest if not lead it,

191
00:09:34.321 --> 00:09:35.640
returned to Catholic England.

192
00:09:35.940 --> 00:09:40.020
The rebellions in invasions failed and in 1727 George the first would be

193
00:09:40.021 --> 00:09:41.310
succeeded by his son George.

194
00:09:41.310 --> 00:09:45.180
That's second after centuries of England dealing with foreign monarchs.

195
00:09:45.181 --> 00:09:48.510
Georgia's second will be the last monarch to be born outside of England.

196
00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:52.780
He was of course,
born in Hanover,
though the following monarchs were native born.

197
00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:56.250
They were perhaps a bit too cozy at home is Georgia's second was also the last

198
00:09:56.251 --> 00:09:59.340
English monarch to lead an army into battle during the war of Austrian

199
00:09:59.341 --> 00:10:00.090
succession.

200
00:10:00.090 --> 00:10:03.630
Another messy dynastic conflict and global conflict of that in which Britain

201
00:10:03.631 --> 00:10:07.320
joined forces with Austria,
the Dutch and Russia against France,
Spain,

202
00:10:07.321 --> 00:10:08.940
and pressure as well as other powers.

203
00:10:09.060 --> 00:10:12.240
George was much more focused on warfare during his reign.

204
00:10:12.270 --> 00:10:16.530
Then his father had been in 1754 following the mess left during other conflicts

205
00:10:16.531 --> 00:10:19.890
like the Borup Austrian succession.
The seven years war erupted,

206
00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:22.650
the seven years' war,
which was actually nine years long,

207
00:10:22.651 --> 00:10:27.500
but picked up more so from 1756 at 1763 is often remark as being a first true

208
00:10:27.510 --> 00:10:31.200
world war Britain pressure and Portugal join forces with some other European

209
00:10:31.201 --> 00:10:34.710
powers against France,
Austria,
Russia,
Spain,
and their allies.

210
00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:37.020
It was fought in Europe,
in North America,

211
00:10:37.021 --> 00:10:40.620
where does coming known as the French and Indian war here in this theater,

212
00:10:40.621 --> 00:10:43.470
the French have Nouvelle France along with our native American allies,

213
00:10:43.471 --> 00:10:44.760
fought against the British forces.

214
00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:47.780
The results of the conflict here was for the future for North America and

215
00:10:47.790 --> 00:10:51.480
responsible for the fate of nations like Canada and the United States and South

216
00:10:51.481 --> 00:10:53.520
America.
Portugal and Spain would fight in India.

217
00:10:53.521 --> 00:10:57.360
This war would be known as a third card knack tick war where Britain and France

218
00:10:57.361 --> 00:11:00.960
would fight over the control of India.
This too,
it's about the future for India,

219
00:11:01.050 --> 00:11:02.160
the east India company,

220
00:11:02.161 --> 00:11:04.650
which was formerly intended to be focused on trading in the,

221
00:11:04.651 --> 00:11:08.310
it was now preoccupied with conflict against France and securing a military and

222
00:11:08.311 --> 00:11:10.770
political position in India and Africa.

223
00:11:10.771 --> 00:11:13.740
Britain would attempt to take control of a French outpost on the continent there

224
00:11:13.741 --> 00:11:17.520
as well.
So from Canada,
the long way around the world to the Philippines,

225
00:11:17.521 --> 00:11:20.010
the seven years' war was fought on five continents,

226
00:11:20.011 --> 00:11:22.860
principally between Britain and it's arch-nemesis France,
whom they had.

227
00:11:22.861 --> 00:11:26.550
I'm sure you've noticed in conflict with from much of the century to the point

228
00:11:26.551 --> 00:11:29.310
at which historians often called the 18th century,

229
00:11:29.340 --> 00:11:32.610
the second hundred years war because Britain would fight with France for the

230
00:11:32.611 --> 00:11:34.470
majority of it.
And also keep in mind,

231
00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:37.740
I'll use England and Britain interchangeably at this point because of the

232
00:11:37.741 --> 00:11:38.850
equivalency of the two,

233
00:11:38.851 --> 00:11:42.960
but the p the correct political entity at the time here is the Kingdom of Great

234
00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:43.950
Britain.
As was mentioned,

235
00:11:43.951 --> 00:11:48.480
the war ends in 1763 with a victory on this side of Britain and its allies

236
00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:51.960
officially with the treaty of Paris in North America.

237
00:11:51.961 --> 00:11:54.490
France is largely expelled from the mainland that were retained.

238
00:11:54.491 --> 00:11:58.120
Some North American territory's as its territory is seated to Britain beginning

239
00:11:58.121 --> 00:12:00.430
Britain's oppression of the French Canadian natives.

240
00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:03.640
Though the Louisiana territory was given to Spain in India.

241
00:12:03.641 --> 00:12:05.770
France was not necessarily completely defeated.

242
00:12:05.771 --> 00:12:09.250
Though Britain very much did maintain the upper hand and this seemingly endless

243
00:12:09.251 --> 00:12:10.960
power struggle between Britain and France.

244
00:12:10.961 --> 00:12:14.830
Britain was for the moment on top though there would be many conflicts to come.

245
00:12:14.890 --> 00:12:16.360
During the seven years' war in Georgia.

246
00:12:16.361 --> 00:12:19.030
Second had died and was succeeded by his grandson,
Georgia.

247
00:12:19.031 --> 00:12:23.350
Third would reign for 60 years longer than any monarch proceeding him around the

248
00:12:23.351 --> 00:12:26.710
time of the end of the seven years' war in toward the third ascension to the

249
00:12:26.711 --> 00:12:28.780
throne,
a revolution was beginning to come to life.

250
00:12:28.781 --> 00:12:32.560
Debatably beginning in England,
the industrial revolution,

251
00:12:33.130 --> 00:12:34.810
the industrial revolution debated.

252
00:12:34.811 --> 00:12:38.470
We began in England and the 1760s a technological revolution which moves

253
00:12:38.471 --> 00:12:41.410
products which were hitherto produced by hand,
two machines.

254
00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:45.730
This would cause over the next few centuries and unprecedented population growth

255
00:12:45.731 --> 00:12:49.000
and improvements and general quality of life and availability of goods.

256
00:12:49.660 --> 00:12:52.540
Though Georgia thirds rain was initially marked by success,

257
00:12:52.541 --> 00:12:55.030
it would not remain so steady in North America.

258
00:12:55.031 --> 00:12:58.540
Britain place taxes on its colonists to pay for reparations from the French and

259
00:12:58.541 --> 00:12:59.350
Indian war.

260
00:12:59.350 --> 00:13:02.230
Though the tax is placed on them were lower than those of the natives.

261
00:13:02.350 --> 00:13:03.640
Native British inhabitance.

262
00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:06.940
The North American colonists felt indignant at being subject to under British

263
00:13:06.941 --> 00:13:10.660
law then taxes without equal representation and their parliament as was promised

264
00:13:10.661 --> 00:13:11.830
in the English bill of rights,

265
00:13:12.220 --> 00:13:15.250
the British would not budge and would attempt to suppress the American
colonists,

266
00:13:15.251 --> 00:13:17.380
how the colonists would continue their resistance and efforts,

267
00:13:17.381 --> 00:13:19.960
which would eventually lead to the American war of independence,

268
00:13:19.961 --> 00:13:24.961
which would begin in 1775 but what be made official in 1776 the British held the

269
00:13:25.271 --> 00:13:27.460
upper hand for the first part of the war.
Significantly,

270
00:13:27.461 --> 00:13:30.640
as American colonists lacks significant resources to fight a war,

271
00:13:30.730 --> 00:13:32.440
especially against the British empire,

272
00:13:32.590 --> 00:13:35.380
those resources would come two years later is France.

273
00:13:35.380 --> 00:13:38.780
I entered into the war on the side of the Americans,
Spain too.
In some way,

274
00:13:38.781 --> 00:13:42.280
the Dutch would enter on the American side in order to attempt to subdue
Britain.

275
00:13:42.370 --> 00:13:46.930
In 1783 Britain was following the siege of Yorktown defeated and was forced to

276
00:13:46.931 --> 00:13:49.060
recognize the independence of the United States.

277
00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:52.720
Britain though it retained Canada as Canada had remained loyal during the war,

278
00:13:52.721 --> 00:13:56.680
had now lost the most significant chunk of its American empire,
and as a result,

279
00:13:56.681 --> 00:13:59.890
but now come to focus on new frontiers leading to what is called the second to

280
00:13:59.891 --> 00:14:03.640
British empire in a medium between American representative John Adams and King

281
00:14:03.641 --> 00:14:05.710
George.
The third following the end of the war,

282
00:14:05.711 --> 00:14:07.990
George the third is recorded to have said to Adams,

283
00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:10.450
I was the last to consent to the separation,

284
00:14:10.510 --> 00:14:14.020
the separation having been made and having become inevitable.
I have always said,

285
00:14:14.021 --> 00:14:14.831
as I say now,

286
00:14:14.831 --> 00:14:17.680
that I would be the first to meet the friendship of the United States as an

287
00:14:17.681 --> 00:14:20.080
independent power.
Following the American revolution,

288
00:14:20.081 --> 00:14:21.760
George would suffer mental health issues,

289
00:14:21.761 --> 00:14:25.240
which would worsen throughout his life with the focus on new frontiers

290
00:14:25.241 --> 00:14:26.410
thereafter.
For example,

291
00:14:26.411 --> 00:14:30.790
in 1788 the British claim land in and found that a penal colony with about a

292
00:14:30.790 --> 00:14:34.180
thousand people in Australia previously discovered by Captain James Cook.

293
00:14:34.390 --> 00:14:37.860
This came largely from the fact that Britain's prison population is becoming

294
00:14:37.870 --> 00:14:39.070
excessive and America,

295
00:14:39.071 --> 00:14:42.850
it's former penal colony had declared its independence much like in America,

296
00:14:42.851 --> 00:14:46.000
British settlers would clash with the native inhabitants for much of the

297
00:14:46.001 --> 00:14:46.990
colonization process,

298
00:14:46.991 --> 00:14:50.320
but Britain would retain a hold on Australia and later New Zealand and the

299
00:14:50.321 --> 00:14:51.680
colonies would to grow.

300
00:14:51.740 --> 00:14:54.860
Though the French had successfully taking revenge on Britain from the loss of

301
00:14:54.861 --> 00:14:57.830
their American colonies by assisting the United States and the revolution.

302
00:14:58.010 --> 00:15:00.980
Their efforts there as well as ms managements of their monor came both the

303
00:15:00.981 --> 00:15:04.220
political and in fact meteorology climate of the day.

304
00:15:04.280 --> 00:15:07.820
And by that I mean the devastating winters at France at face led to a revolution

305
00:15:07.821 --> 00:15:12.650
in 1789 at first,
Britain did not have a firm reaction to the French revolution,

306
00:15:12.651 --> 00:15:15.440
but eventually when the revolutionaries beheaded King Louis,

307
00:15:15.441 --> 00:15:19.220
the 16th Britain became considerably worried.
France,

308
00:15:19.250 --> 00:15:22.760
a major European power was now transitioning into our public and not only

309
00:15:22.761 --> 00:15:23.240
Britain,

310
00:15:23.240 --> 00:15:27.200
but in fact a majority of European powers felt it necessary to take measures

311
00:15:27.201 --> 00:15:30.430
against Republican efforts in order to secure their Thrones and prevent any such

312
00:15:30.431 --> 00:15:31.670
movements in their countries.

313
00:15:31.820 --> 00:15:34.970
When France declared war on the nations which are perceived as a threat to their

314
00:15:34.971 --> 00:15:38.330
revolution.
Britain form the first coalition with Austria,
Prussia,

315
00:15:38.331 --> 00:15:41.990
and other major European powers as the various powers of Europe fought with and

316
00:15:41.991 --> 00:15:45.080
may piece with friends individually on multiple occasions in the first and

317
00:15:45.081 --> 00:15:45.980
second coalition,

318
00:15:45.981 --> 00:15:48.890
Britain remained staunchly and and a meat of the French revolution throughout

319
00:15:48.891 --> 00:15:52.460
its duration.
For instance,
tempt it to incur insurrection in Ireland,

320
00:15:52.461 --> 00:15:56.120
but it failed soon after.
On January 1st,

321
00:15:56.120 --> 00:15:57.890
1801 the first day of the 19th century,

322
00:15:57.891 --> 00:15:59.990
George the third in his prime minister at the time,

323
00:15:59.991 --> 00:16:03.110
William Pitt merges Ireland into a single state along with England,

324
00:16:03.111 --> 00:16:03.944
Wales and Scotland,

325
00:16:03.950 --> 00:16:07.340
now known officially as the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland.
Now,

326
00:16:07.341 --> 00:16:11.120
Ireland was in the same political union at Scotland had entered into a hundred

327
00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:13.970
years ago.
Unlike Wales and Scotland.
Ireland,
however,

328
00:16:13.971 --> 00:16:15.620
had remains predominantly Catholic.

329
00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:19.610
William Pitt considered removing certain legal restrictions placed on Catholics

330
00:16:19.611 --> 00:16:20.690
in the United Kingdom of the day,

331
00:16:20.691 --> 00:16:23.480
but Georgia third refuse maintaining Protestant authority.

332
00:16:23.510 --> 00:16:28.010
The French Revolution had come to an official end two years prior in 1799 but

333
00:16:28.011 --> 00:16:31.550
Britain refuse to see it that way.
Napoleon Bonaparte,
a French general,

334
00:16:31.551 --> 00:16:33.860
had led a coup d'etat and seize power in France,

335
00:16:33.920 --> 00:16:37.940
but Britain remained at war with them.
In 1801 Britain agreed to a piece,

336
00:16:37.941 --> 00:16:41.360
but Georgia third in his government had no intention of allowing a lasting peace

337
00:16:41.570 --> 00:16:42.380
and what's more.

338
00:16:42.380 --> 00:16:47.380
Napoleon had clearly no intentions of remaining dormant war resumed in 1803

339
00:16:48.051 --> 00:16:50.330
entering Britain into the Napoleonic wars,

340
00:16:50.840 --> 00:16:54.470
a series of conflicts which would last until 1815 in which Britain would remain

341
00:16:54.471 --> 00:16:58.070
Napoleon's arch-nemesis Britain had throughout this war and throughout much of

342
00:16:58.071 --> 00:17:02.030
the 18th century in fact,
and army,
which was considerably inferior,

343
00:17:02.100 --> 00:17:05.570
that at France,
Napoleon's army,
for example,
during the Napoleonic wars,

344
00:17:05.870 --> 00:17:09.500
but grow to be five times as large as Britain's and an arguably better equipped.

345
00:17:09.710 --> 00:17:11.870
Why would Britain allows such a tip and the scale?

346
00:17:12.020 --> 00:17:14.030
Because the British ruled the seas,

347
00:17:14.090 --> 00:17:17.600
they must definitely had a superior navy and as an island,
nation,

348
00:17:17.601 --> 00:17:19.490
France or any other of Britain's rifles,

349
00:17:19.491 --> 00:17:23.060
they didn't have much of a shot at threatening Britain or disrupting his contact

350
00:17:23.061 --> 00:17:24.350
with any of it's overseas colonies.

351
00:17:24.351 --> 00:17:27.530
Because of this very powerful on challenged navy,

352
00:17:27.980 --> 00:17:31.220
France though would attempt to challenge Britain's naval superiority and would

353
00:17:31.221 --> 00:17:35.630
plan to invade the island in 1805 the British navy under the command of Lord

354
00:17:35.631 --> 00:17:39.290
Horatio Nelson and engage the French and Spanish ships planning the invasion off

355
00:17:39.291 --> 00:17:42.950
the coast of Spain.
The British engage them in until they've lost 500 men,

356
00:17:42.951 --> 00:17:46.130
including Lord Nelson himself.
They did not lose a single ship.

357
00:17:46.370 --> 00:17:49.100
The Spanish and French lost 22 ships.
Lord,

358
00:17:49.340 --> 00:17:53.490
his last words are recorded as thank God I have done my duty following this.

359
00:17:53.491 --> 00:17:55.770
Napoleon would concentrate his efforts on the continent,

360
00:17:55.771 --> 00:17:57.270
but even during the height of his empire,

361
00:17:57.330 --> 00:17:59.760
Britain would remain a Thornton to point side.

362
00:17:59.820 --> 00:18:01.950
Britain quite naturally finance the points.

363
00:18:01.951 --> 00:18:05.730
Enemies and Napoleon responded by banning trade with Britain across as empire,

364
00:18:05.731 --> 00:18:09.450
but this would backfire hurting Europe's economy.
Morgan Britons who is navy,

365
00:18:09.460 --> 00:18:12.180
allowed it to break through restrictions placed by their French and cause much

366
00:18:12.181 --> 00:18:15.630
of Europe to resent the full eight and Britain was engaged in other conflicts

367
00:18:15.631 --> 00:18:18.720
during his time as well,
such as the war of 1812 with the United States,

368
00:18:18.721 --> 00:18:22.740
which ended in a stalemate as well as indirect campaigns against the point and

369
00:18:22.830 --> 00:18:24.510
war with Denmark and the Netherlands.

370
00:18:24.540 --> 00:18:28.170
But a chance came from more direct confrontation against Napoleon in Spain.

371
00:18:28.230 --> 00:18:32.670
Spain rose up against French occupation and Britain in Portugal rose up to join

372
00:18:32.671 --> 00:18:34.500
them leading to the peninsular war.

373
00:18:34.560 --> 00:18:37.350
Napoleon was losing to Anglo Iberian forces largely again,

374
00:18:37.351 --> 00:18:39.990
that's command of the Duke of Wellington.
During this war,

375
00:18:39.991 --> 00:18:41.880
Napoleon made a catastrophic mistake.

376
00:18:41.881 --> 00:18:44.720
I'm invading Russia where he was greatly to feed his enemies,

377
00:18:44.760 --> 00:18:48.240
closed in from the east with Britain now invading the south of France from Spain

378
00:18:48.390 --> 00:18:51.390
in 1814 friends was forced to surrender.
Following this,

379
00:18:51.391 --> 00:18:55.260
Napoleon was exiled to the island of Elba near Italy and Britain and its allies

380
00:18:55.270 --> 00:18:59.550
restore the Bourbon King Louis the 18th the French thrown and redrew the borders

381
00:18:59.551 --> 00:19:02.970
of Europe and the Congress of Vienna.
And here is a map of what those borders.

382
00:19:02.971 --> 00:19:06.240
It looks like Napoleon was not done though.

383
00:19:06.330 --> 00:19:10.380
In 18 and 15 he returned and what is known as a hundred days Napoleon's come

384
00:19:10.381 --> 00:19:14.040
back rested upon winning a battle against the coalition against him and at that

385
00:19:14.041 --> 00:19:14.490
battle,

386
00:19:14.490 --> 00:19:18.450
the battle of Waterloo engage in British Prussian and other European forces.

387
00:19:18.540 --> 00:19:21.150
Napoleon,
however,
was once again to feed it in this time,

388
00:19:21.151 --> 00:19:25.050
exiled to the island of Saint Halena well off the coast of Africa where he died

389
00:19:25.051 --> 00:19:29.700
six years later in 1821 during the Napoleonic wars she worked with third had

390
00:19:29.701 --> 00:19:33.450
finally succumbed to his mental illness permanently in 1811 his son,

391
00:19:33.451 --> 00:19:37.140
Georgia fourths or of this prince regions until his father died and became king

392
00:19:37.200 --> 00:19:41.940
in 1820 with Napoleon defeated Britain and in fact much of Europe was now moving

393
00:19:41.941 --> 00:19:43.080
toward a new era.

394
00:19:43.350 --> 00:19:46.620
The congress of Vienna had achieved a balance of power in Europe between the

395
00:19:46.621 --> 00:19:50.820
major powers of the day,
Britain,
France,
Austria,
Prussia in Russia,

396
00:19:50.880 --> 00:19:54.360
the points republican ideals swept through Europe causing liberal uprisings in

397
00:19:54.361 --> 00:19:58.050
many of the nations there several powers attempted to suppress them,
but Britain,

398
00:19:58.080 --> 00:20:00.750
which had been traditionally more democratic than its counterparts,

399
00:20:00.780 --> 00:20:03.060
embraced many of them throughout the 19th century.

400
00:20:03.090 --> 00:20:06.300
It was toward the end of the reign of Georgia third in the beginning of Georgia

401
00:20:06.301 --> 00:20:09.810
forest at the king's ministers rather than the king himself with dictate the

402
00:20:09.811 --> 00:20:11.880
direction of the government along with parliament.

403
00:20:11.910 --> 00:20:15.340
Britain would also end slavery threat it's empire in the early 19th century and

404
00:20:15.341 --> 00:20:19.200
in fact would make attempts to relocate these slaves to their colony of Sierra

405
00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:20.010
Leone in Africa.

406
00:20:20.010 --> 00:20:23.370
The industrial revolution was taking root in Britain with France knocked out of

407
00:20:23.371 --> 00:20:23.641
the way.

408
00:20:23.641 --> 00:20:26.880
Britain was free to enter into what it would have remembered as its imperial

409
00:20:26.881 --> 00:20:30.900
century and we had expanded its empire considerably across the globe becoming at

410
00:20:30.901 --> 00:20:33.720
its height,
the largest empire the world had ever seen.

411
00:20:33.900 --> 00:20:35.760
While Britain was busy across the globe,

412
00:20:35.761 --> 00:20:38.490
though the rest of Europe remained in a moderate level of peace.

413
00:20:38.970 --> 00:20:43.260
Conflict on the scale of the Napoleonic wars would not be seen again until 1914

414
00:20:43.261 --> 00:20:48.261
which is why the imperial century 1815 to 1914 is also to as packs for Tanika.

415
00:20:49.270 --> 00:20:50.170
The British piece.

416
00:20:50.440 --> 00:20:53.650
Britain now had a considerable interest in expanding into Asia.

417
00:20:54.100 --> 00:20:56.800
It had already moved in on India,
Southeast Asia,

418
00:20:56.801 --> 00:20:59.920
and most of Oceania and other nearby areas in the Middle East.

419
00:21:00.310 --> 00:21:03.940
Now with the Ottoman Empire,
Persia and China all in decline,

420
00:21:03.970 --> 00:21:07.420
the British empire saw their opportunity to expand to a greater degree.

421
00:21:07.960 --> 00:21:12.130
Britain was not entirely unrivaled in the century,
however,
especially in Asia,

422
00:21:12.131 --> 00:21:15.340
where they competed with Russia over the control of Central Asia for much of the

423
00:21:15.341 --> 00:21:17.890
19th century and what is known as at the great game,

424
00:21:17.920 --> 00:21:21.880
direct and indirect conflict with Russia would manifest itself in multiple wars.

425
00:21:21.940 --> 00:21:26.380
In 1837 at the age of 18 Victoria became queen of Britain and of the British

426
00:21:26.381 --> 00:21:30.130
empire following death of king blame.
Fourth being a woman.
However,

427
00:21:30.131 --> 00:21:32.830
she was barred from succeeding him to the throne of Hanover.

428
00:21:32.890 --> 00:21:36.310
Victoria would reign over Britain until 1901 during the better part of its

429
00:21:36.311 --> 00:21:37.330
imperial age.

430
00:21:38.080 --> 00:21:41.410
Her early rain was marked by complex across the world in China.

431
00:21:41.590 --> 00:21:45.250
The first opium war conflict between the Ching Dynasty in Britain named after

432
00:21:45.280 --> 00:21:45.910
opium.

433
00:21:45.910 --> 00:21:49.240
The drug which many Chinese were worryingly addicted to that Britain eagerly

434
00:21:49.241 --> 00:21:52.920
supplied was fought.
A few years later,
the first Afghan war war,

435
00:21:52.930 --> 00:21:56.350
a part of the great game with Russia would erupt during Victoria's reign.

436
00:21:56.351 --> 00:22:00.370
England would begin to truly modernize quality of life increase as medicine and

437
00:22:00.371 --> 00:22:04.390
science expanded railways in such forms of transportation were introduced it to

438
00:22:04.391 --> 00:22:07.480
country,
world empire spread new products across the globe.

439
00:22:07.600 --> 00:22:10.750
Workers' movements would reform the poor conditions of labor in the country.

440
00:22:10.810 --> 00:22:13.210
English culture would progress and spread across the world,

441
00:22:13.211 --> 00:22:16.820
including the English language,
which today remains the dominant world language.

442
00:22:16.840 --> 00:22:19.930
They'll not the most spoken England would expand and as South Africa,

443
00:22:19.960 --> 00:22:21.220
parts of Latin America,

444
00:22:21.250 --> 00:22:23.830
Egypt and other parts of the Middle East and Southeast Asia.

445
00:22:23.890 --> 00:22:25.210
The population of England,

446
00:22:25.211 --> 00:22:28.520
Wales and Scotland would double the population of Britain's Australian colony

447
00:22:28.580 --> 00:22:31.750
would explode during this time too.
During the Victorian gold rush,
though,

448
00:22:31.780 --> 00:22:35.140
places such as Ireland would suffer feminine emigration.
In fact,

449
00:22:35.141 --> 00:22:38.220
Ireland's population during this time would be cut in half color over killed

450
00:22:38.221 --> 00:22:42.010
nearly 2000 people a week in the UK in poverty would accompany this population

451
00:22:42.011 --> 00:22:46.180
explosion.
Meanwhile,
the eastern question was posed upon European powers.

452
00:22:46.390 --> 00:22:49.960
The Ottoman empire was in decline and a power vacuum had to be procured by

453
00:22:49.961 --> 00:22:50.794
someone.

454
00:22:51.100 --> 00:22:54.910
This is what led as mentioned to Britain occupying territory such as Egypt in

455
00:22:54.911 --> 00:22:56.740
the southern part of the Arabian peninsula,

456
00:22:56.920 --> 00:23:00.100
but more important to the British was keeping the Russians out of the Ottoman

457
00:23:00.101 --> 00:23:02.230
decline.
This would lead to the Crimean war.

458
00:23:02.231 --> 00:23:06.220
In 1854 Britain teamed up with France and the Ottoman Empire against Russia in

459
00:23:06.221 --> 00:23:08.080
its brief interval impacts Britannica.

460
00:23:08.140 --> 00:23:10.420
Though Britain and its allies would end up winning the war.

461
00:23:10.421 --> 00:23:14.110
The British people were largely against it and protested British intervention,

462
00:23:14.260 --> 00:23:16.600
the original borders before the war,
we'll restore it,

463
00:23:16.601 --> 00:23:20.530
but Russian influence in the region significantly declined as a result allowing

464
00:23:20.531 --> 00:23:23.860
Britain and France and secure the remains of the dying Ottoman Empire.

465
00:23:24.340 --> 00:23:29.290
In 1858 phone revolt and unrest,
Britain decided to annex India entirely.

466
00:23:29.470 --> 00:23:34.020
Victoria subsequently took on the title Emperor of India in the 1860 [inaudible]

467
00:23:34.030 --> 00:23:35.110
during the American civil war,

468
00:23:35.111 --> 00:23:38.110
Britain considered intervening to assist itself even though the north was

469
00:23:38.111 --> 00:23:41.020
supported largely with the British populous,
largely because of trade.

470
00:23:41.230 --> 00:23:44.280
It's southwest producing quite a bit of cotton for which Britain used when

471
00:23:44.300 --> 00:23:47.450
American president issued the emancipation proclamation.
However,

472
00:23:47.451 --> 00:23:49.610
and slavery became a key issue of the civil war,

473
00:23:49.611 --> 00:23:51.950
Britain abstained and not wanting to support slavery,

474
00:23:51.951 --> 00:23:54.170
which they had already outlawed earlier that century.

475
00:23:54.200 --> 00:23:58.040
This was just one example of the fact that Britain was to the joy of some and

476
00:23:58.041 --> 00:24:00.950
disdain of others playing the role of global policemen.

477
00:24:00.951 --> 00:24:05.951
At this time in history in 1879 the Anglos Zulu warrior began as a British,

478
00:24:06.081 --> 00:24:09.650
instigated a war with a nearby Zulu Katen them in north occupy more of southern

479
00:24:09.651 --> 00:24:12.440
Africa,
the Zulus where to feed it,
but the board republics,

480
00:24:12.441 --> 00:24:15.080
which for African nations set up by former Dutch colonists.

481
00:24:15.200 --> 00:24:17.600
No longer relying on Britain for protection from the Zulus.

482
00:24:17.630 --> 00:24:20.930
Soon we're threatened by British domination of the region leading to the Boer

483
00:24:20.931 --> 00:24:22.640
wars and the first borough war.

484
00:24:22.700 --> 00:24:25.610
The British were to feed it and the more republics maintained independence.

485
00:24:26.120 --> 00:24:29.180
These conflicts were a predecessor of the scramble for Africa.

486
00:24:29.570 --> 00:24:33.020
The scramble for Africa was essentially an event in which Africa was divided

487
00:24:33.021 --> 00:24:35.120
between European powers.
Prior to this,

488
00:24:35.121 --> 00:24:38.690
only some areas on the continent have been occupied by Europeans.
Following this,

489
00:24:38.691 --> 00:24:43.130
the mal came to look like this.
Much of Africa was divided amongst Britain,

490
00:24:43.160 --> 00:24:47.150
France,
Belgium,
Italy,
Germany,
Portugal,
and Spain with only Ethiopia,

491
00:24:47.151 --> 00:24:49.460
the dervish state in Liberia.
I remaining independent.

492
00:24:49.520 --> 00:24:52.940
Ethiopia would eventually succumb to Italy in the Second World War.
However,

493
00:24:52.941 --> 00:24:56.690
and Liberia was a nation established by the United States for formerly enslaved

494
00:24:56.691 --> 00:24:58.640
Africans to return to in case you were wondering.

495
00:24:58.700 --> 00:25:01.130
British colonies are shown in red.
As you can see,

496
00:25:01.131 --> 00:25:03.590
they along with France controlled much of the continent,

497
00:25:03.591 --> 00:25:07.340
which is of course why much of Africa today speaks English and French.

498
00:25:07.670 --> 00:25:09.980
Looking here though was sued vest Africa.

499
00:25:10.010 --> 00:25:13.370
By this time Germany had United into this single country and was the rival of

500
00:25:13.371 --> 00:25:16.460
Britain and age where nationalist sentiments part across the Europe.

501
00:25:16.490 --> 00:25:20.090
Pressure here caused Britain to move to annex and Bora Publix and the second bar

502
00:25:20.110 --> 00:25:20.420
war.

503
00:25:20.420 --> 00:25:24.620
Britain could not brag about having a union jack flying from Cairo to Cape Town,

504
00:25:24.710 --> 00:25:27.650
both Germany and the United States at this time,

505
00:25:27.651 --> 00:25:31.280
both threatened to take brands position as the industrial power of the world and

506
00:25:31.281 --> 00:25:34.100
France and other European powers are main constant threats as well.

507
00:25:34.190 --> 00:25:37.520
On top of this across Europe,
this nationalist sentiment,
as I said,

508
00:25:37.521 --> 00:25:38.570
was creating tension.

509
00:25:39.320 --> 00:25:43.820
Victoria died in 1901 at the age of 81 thus bringing an end to her era.

510
00:25:43.970 --> 00:25:45.880
She was succeeded by her son who became Edward.

511
00:25:45.881 --> 00:25:47.900
The seventh ushering in the Edwardian era.

512
00:25:48.020 --> 00:25:50.930
Victoria was the last monarch of the Hana variant house.

513
00:25:51.020 --> 00:25:54.230
The Edwardian era would witness another time period of great change.

514
00:25:54.320 --> 00:25:58.220
Technologically,
the world was being introduced to things like airplanes,
cars,

515
00:25:58.221 --> 00:26:00.170
and other inventions,
scientific discoveries.

516
00:26:00.260 --> 00:26:02.900
Women were beginning to organize for their right to vote and other social

517
00:26:02.901 --> 00:26:05.600
movements were beginning to sprout.
However,
on the darker side for England,

518
00:26:05.601 --> 00:26:08.330
Ireland was beginning to press for independence from the British empire and

519
00:26:08.331 --> 00:26:11.960
worsen this.
Europe was edging closer to the bloodiest war it had ever seen.

520
00:26:12.140 --> 00:26:16.220
World War One.
In 1914 rising nationalism,

521
00:26:16.221 --> 00:26:19.340
industrialism and imperialism and the Western world would finally come together

522
00:26:19.341 --> 00:26:23.090
to explode into the Great War marketing the end of Britain's imperial century

523
00:26:23.091 --> 00:26:24.680
and it's entrance into a new era.

524
00:26:24.800 --> 00:26:28.940
Following the assassination of archduke Ferdinand of Austria and Serbia,

525
00:26:29.120 --> 00:26:32.870
the Austrian Hungarian Empire declared war on Serbia.
Russia responded,

526
00:26:32.871 --> 00:26:35.780
declaring war on Usha.
Germany came to the aid of us.

527
00:26:35.790 --> 00:26:37.700
Your France came to the aid of Russia.

528
00:26:37.760 --> 00:26:41.550
Germany then invaded France and Belgium and Britain joined Fred's and Russia

529
00:26:41.551 --> 00:26:43.740
side and the Ottoman Empire joined war in Germany,

530
00:26:43.770 --> 00:26:48.630
Austria side and the World War one was does set to engulf the whole continent.

531
00:26:48.870 --> 00:26:50.790
The alliance in Britain,
France and Russia,

532
00:26:50.791 --> 00:26:53.190
their colonies and other nations such as Serbia,
Japan,

533
00:26:53.191 --> 00:26:56.610
and Italy are often referred to as the allied powers.
Germany,

534
00:26:56.611 --> 00:27:00.360
Australia Ottomans and their allies in colonies were known as a central powers.

535
00:27:00.420 --> 00:27:04.350
The population of the British empire rally together for war or so.

536
00:27:04.351 --> 00:27:07.920
The propaganda said the British were draw forces from Canada,
New Zealand,

537
00:27:07.921 --> 00:27:09.660
South Africa,
Australia,
India,

538
00:27:09.720 --> 00:27:13.020
and the rest of its empire to fight on the emerging western front as well as

539
00:27:13.021 --> 00:27:14.850
against the Ottoman Empire in the Middle East.

540
00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:17.460
Some were more willing to go than others in Ireland.

541
00:27:17.461 --> 00:27:18.810
Support for independence was beginning.

542
00:27:18.811 --> 00:27:22.020
An Irish nationalists abrogated by conscription and believing Britain to be

543
00:27:22.021 --> 00:27:25.230
distracted by the war rose up attempting to declare independence.

544
00:27:25.410 --> 00:27:29.370
The effort failed,
but it would not be the last one in Quebec,

545
00:27:29.460 --> 00:27:31.170
Australia and other parts of the empire.

546
00:27:31.171 --> 00:27:34.680
Konis supporting the war that they didn't feel personally involved in fighting

547
00:27:34.681 --> 00:27:38.310
under flag of which they question their loyalty would sow the seeds for disorder

548
00:27:38.311 --> 00:27:41.970
in later parts of the century during World War One anti German sentiment would

549
00:27:41.971 --> 00:27:43.280
lead to the house of sacs,

550
00:27:43.350 --> 00:27:46.290
Colbert in Carthage to change their name to the house of Windsor,

551
00:27:46.291 --> 00:27:47.640
which remains to this day.

552
00:27:48.330 --> 00:27:52.560
World War One would in many ways modernize the British military machine,
guns,

553
00:27:52.561 --> 00:27:56.280
tanks,
poison gas,
some marines and other such technologies enter the scene.

554
00:27:56.340 --> 00:27:59.700
The utilization of airplanes led to the founding of the Royal Air Force.

555
00:27:59.790 --> 00:28:00.601
By the end of the war,

556
00:28:00.601 --> 00:28:04.440
the British army had increased in size by 25 times its original.

557
00:28:04.500 --> 00:28:07.680
I've mentioned throughout this video wars which Britain had fought such as the

558
00:28:07.681 --> 00:28:12.330
seven years' war or the Napoleonic wars were arguably the first rolled wars,

559
00:28:12.450 --> 00:28:16.320
but they pale in comparison to the strain and level of conflict that world war

560
00:28:16.321 --> 00:28:20.250
one place on the entire world.
The western front on which Britain,

561
00:28:20.251 --> 00:28:23.250
France would fight against.
Germany became a stagnating killing field.

562
00:28:23.790 --> 00:28:26.670
Both sides dug trenches and endeavor that safety enemies trench.

563
00:28:26.700 --> 00:28:30.090
This would go on for months with neither side getting large amounts of grounds.

564
00:28:30.150 --> 00:28:33.060
All the while millions would die on the sea.
However,

565
00:28:33.061 --> 00:28:34.440
Britain held obvious superiority,

566
00:28:34.441 --> 00:28:39.150
defeating Germany on multiple occasions in 1917 Russia to come to the first

567
00:28:39.151 --> 00:28:41.160
Republican,
but then communist revolutions,

568
00:28:41.161 --> 00:28:42.630
it would be forced to drop out of the war.

569
00:28:42.750 --> 00:28:44.940
Germany could no focus its effort on the west,

570
00:28:44.941 --> 00:28:47.790
which concern Britain and France that same year,
however,

571
00:28:47.791 --> 00:28:50.370
the United States of joy and the allies against the central powers,

572
00:28:50.490 --> 00:28:53.550
the United States was not yet the military machine on a scale that Britain,

573
00:28:53.551 --> 00:28:57.420
France,
and Germany had been,
but they didn't have to be.
Their military was fresh.

574
00:28:57.450 --> 00:29:00.720
The country's wealthy industrial and and ravaged by the war that had that thus

575
00:29:00.721 --> 00:29:04.110
far torn Europe apart and that made their intervention crucial.

576
00:29:04.200 --> 00:29:07.740
The allies pushed into the central powers and the war ended on the 11th hour of

577
00:29:07.741 --> 00:29:09.330
the 11th Day of the 11th month.

578
00:29:09.600 --> 00:29:13.670
In 1918 Britain had lost slightly over a million people and combined with the

579
00:29:13.671 --> 00:29:18.000
Spanish flu which had the country in 1918 world war one itself was a devastating

580
00:29:18.001 --> 00:29:19.320
or a deal to all of Europe.

581
00:29:19.560 --> 00:29:22.710
Though Britain was admittedly better off than most nations on the main

582
00:29:22.730 --> 00:29:26.580
continents,
the empires and monarchies of Germany,
Austria or Russia,

583
00:29:26.581 --> 00:29:28.410
and the Ottoman Empire had all collapsed.

584
00:29:28.470 --> 00:29:30.390
Many new nations arose following the peace.

585
00:29:30.391 --> 00:29:32.850
Treaties and Europe began to gradually change.

586
00:29:32.940 --> 00:29:34.440
Following the treaty of Versailles,

587
00:29:34.450 --> 00:29:37.770
Britain and especially friends focused on weakening Germany and preventing

588
00:29:37.771 --> 00:29:41.130
another conflict of equivalent scale.
Unfortunately,

589
00:29:41.410 --> 00:29:44.230
the term said Britain and France and placed on Germany.

590
00:29:44.231 --> 00:29:48.250
We're rather vindictive and placed on them with the intention of blaming Germany

591
00:29:48.280 --> 00:29:50.290
for everything that had happened.
When in reality,

592
00:29:50.291 --> 00:29:52.670
perhaps no single nation or more broadly now,

593
00:29:52.680 --> 00:29:55.300
there's side was entirely to blame for the war.

594
00:29:55.330 --> 00:29:58.090
Britain and France absorbed Germany's colonies.
Through this,

595
00:29:58.091 --> 00:30:01.780
Britain would be absorbed 13 million new subjects and would rise to its height

596
00:30:01.781 --> 00:30:06.400
remaining.
To this day,
the largest empire which has ever existed at this height,

597
00:30:06.401 --> 00:30:09.210
it would rule over a significant portion of the world's population and

598
00:30:09.211 --> 00:30:13.960
controlled nearly one fourth of its land mass.
Here is the map of that empire.

599
00:30:14.740 --> 00:30:18.160
Quite a long way to come from feuding Anglo Saxon tribes,

600
00:30:18.640 --> 00:30:20.980
Frances Empire to would grow following the war.

601
00:30:20.980 --> 00:30:23.770
Though other allies like Italy and Japan fell to their efforts,

602
00:30:23.771 --> 00:30:25.240
were not properly compensated,

603
00:30:25.270 --> 00:30:27.910
leading to resentment and along with anger and embarrassment,

604
00:30:27.911 --> 00:30:30.190
and Germany's sowed the seeds for the conflict.

605
00:30:30.280 --> 00:30:33.310
As the British Empire entered into his post World War One era,

606
00:30:33.311 --> 00:30:37.450
many things will begin to change.
The the British empire had grown significantly.

607
00:30:37.451 --> 00:30:40.120
It was beginning to weaken and some of its core areas,

608
00:30:40.300 --> 00:30:44.380
many colonies such as India began to question his loyalty to the empire began

609
00:30:44.390 --> 00:30:48.070
independence movement Ireland rose up in their ward if independence against

610
00:30:48.071 --> 00:30:51.790
Great Britain eventually gaining that independence in 1922 though are they

611
00:30:51.791 --> 00:30:54.940
remained a dominion of the British Empire for some years after that.

612
00:30:55.030 --> 00:30:56.260
Northern Ireland,
however,

613
00:30:56.261 --> 00:30:59.650
which consisted of Protestants loyal to England was not in the same boat as the

614
00:30:59.651 --> 00:31:00.600
rest of our lineage.

615
00:31:00.620 --> 00:31:04.180
Siding against independence movements and in fact to this day remains a part of

616
00:31:04.181 --> 00:31:05.014
the United Kingdom.

617
00:31:05.290 --> 00:31:10.030
Egypt to would gain a significant amount of independence during the 20s somewhat

618
00:31:10.060 --> 00:31:12.160
argue that Britain due to social reforms,

619
00:31:12.190 --> 00:31:16.090
was experiencing improved quality of life.
Wish had hitherto not been seen.

620
00:31:16.150 --> 00:31:19.540
There was also a social changes throughout the 20s as following the darkness of

621
00:31:19.541 --> 00:31:23.170
World War One,
people became considerably more hedonistic and loose.

622
00:31:23.260 --> 00:31:26.410
However others point out,
the lacking state of the British economy,

623
00:31:26.440 --> 00:31:29.650
Britain was falling behind the United States as the world industrial power.

624
00:31:29.651 --> 00:31:32.710
Though Britain saw the United States has more of a friend than a rival.

625
00:31:32.860 --> 00:31:35.260
Britain had other enemies on the horizon to worry about.

626
00:31:35.320 --> 00:31:39.040
Militaristic governments have taken power in Germany and Italy and Japan on the

627
00:31:39.041 --> 00:31:42.760
one side on the other with relation to the Great Depression that hit Britain and

628
00:31:42.761 --> 00:31:45.430
thirties and more severely in other parts of the world.

629
00:31:45.431 --> 00:31:49.840
Fear of the failure of capitalism was encouraged by the rising Soviet Union and

630
00:31:49.841 --> 00:31:51.490
their intention to spread communism.

631
00:31:51.760 --> 00:31:56.760
In January of 1933 Germany had elected an Austrian war veteran named ad off

632
00:31:57.011 --> 00:32:00.730
Hitler to be their leader through repair the disgrace of Germany following World

633
00:32:00.730 --> 00:32:03.430
War One Hitler was successful in revitalizing Germany,

634
00:32:03.431 --> 00:32:05.560
but he was not satisfied with that alone.

635
00:32:05.650 --> 00:32:09.790
He wanted to empower Germany to be a major European power and expand its power

636
00:32:09.850 --> 00:32:12.880
throughout the world.
In contrast,
of course to the will of Britain,

637
00:32:12.881 --> 00:32:14.230
France and the other allies,

638
00:32:14.410 --> 00:32:17.380
Germany broke several of the restrictions placed on it from the treaty of

639
00:32:17.381 --> 00:32:18.820
Versailles,
but France and Britain,

640
00:32:18.870 --> 00:32:20.500
if you're in the outbreak of another great war,

641
00:32:20.501 --> 00:32:24.010
allowed him leniency and what's what is referred to as their policy of

642
00:32:24.011 --> 00:32:26.710
appeasement.
In reality,
by failing to act quickly,

643
00:32:26.711 --> 00:32:30.070
they may have allowed another world war to be inevitable.

644
00:32:30.340 --> 00:32:34.120
Germany sign alliances with Italy and Japan and it was when Hitler invaded

645
00:32:34.121 --> 00:32:37.960
Poland in 1939 that Britain and France flight of the cleared war leading to

646
00:32:37.961 --> 00:32:42.650
World War Two the great majority of Europe fell at the German Nazi empire.

647
00:32:42.710 --> 00:32:45.800
By late 1940 even France would fall within a matter of weeks.

648
00:32:45.801 --> 00:32:49.130
Despite expectations that war on the border with France could last few months,

649
00:32:49.131 --> 00:32:49.881
if not years.

650
00:32:49.881 --> 00:32:54.260
How does as a hat in world war one with the Soviet Union still remaining
neutral,

651
00:32:54.261 --> 00:32:57.560
only the British empire would resist leading to the battle of Britain,

652
00:32:57.561 --> 00:33:00.440
which was the largest aerobatic ever seen during this time.

653
00:33:00.441 --> 00:33:05.000
Winston Churchill who favored a more aggressive policy toward Germany than the

654
00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:07.370
Neville Chamberlain.
His predecessor became prime minister.

655
00:33:07.580 --> 00:33:10.370
He issued many words of encouragement to the British people.

656
00:33:16.710 --> 00:33:18.090
<v 1>We should fight,</v>

657
00:33:26.160 --> 00:33:29.830
fight on the beaches,
on the landing grounds.

658
00:33:30.550 --> 00:33:33.810
We can fight in the field ended in the street,

659
00:33:36.180 --> 00:33:37.013
which we'll never know.

660
00:33:37.610 --> 00:33:41.950
<v 0>Sharonda soon Britain was alleviated from varying the burden of the German</v>

661
00:33:41.951 --> 00:33:45.910
empire.
As Germany invaded the Soviet Union,
Russia would join the allied side.

662
00:33:45.940 --> 00:33:49.390
When Japan attacked both British Malaysia and American for Pearl Harbor,

663
00:33:49.420 --> 00:33:51.970
the United States would join the war as well.
On the allied side,

664
00:33:52.630 --> 00:33:56.380
Britain was no engaged in conflict in Europe,
North Africa,
in the Mediterranean,

665
00:33:56.410 --> 00:33:57.430
and the Pacific Ocean.

666
00:33:57.730 --> 00:34:01.460
The most significant failure here was a fall of the stronghold of Singapore,

667
00:34:01.520 --> 00:34:04.150
the Japanese,
which push the British believe to be an impenetrable one.

668
00:34:04.690 --> 00:34:08.530
The surrender was referred to by Winston Churchill as the worst disaster in

669
00:34:08.531 --> 00:34:09.790
British military history,

670
00:34:09.910 --> 00:34:13.030
British failure and the Pacific would lead Australia and New Zealand to

671
00:34:13.031 --> 00:34:16.030
coordinate their efforts more with the United States and the support to the

672
00:34:16.031 --> 00:34:19.240
United States and Soviet Union would be decisive factor in switching the balance

673
00:34:19.241 --> 00:34:21.760
of power from the access to the allies.
Gradually,

674
00:34:21.761 --> 00:34:26.740
they would begin to gain the upper hand in June of 1944 who allied forces and

675
00:34:26.741 --> 00:34:28.960
Britain,
United States,
Canada,
Australia,

676
00:34:28.961 --> 00:34:32.290
and the resistances of occupied European nations invaded German,

677
00:34:32.291 --> 00:34:34.990
held Norman eat and what is known as a d day invasion.

678
00:34:35.200 --> 00:34:38.470
These invasions came in tandem with the Soviet Union beginning to turn a war

679
00:34:38.471 --> 00:34:42.040
round on the eastern front Britain in the United States and their allies pushed

680
00:34:42.230 --> 00:34:44.890
and the western front,
the Soviets from the east.
As I said,

681
00:34:45.100 --> 00:34:47.290
Germany was not being in close upon Japan.

682
00:34:47.291 --> 00:34:50.890
Two was beginning to see its demise and the Pacific as the allies close into

683
00:34:50.891 --> 00:34:55.310
Germany and then to Berlin.
In 1945 Hitler committed suicide.
Soon thereafter,

684
00:34:55.420 --> 00:34:57.130
Germany unconditionally surrendered.

685
00:34:57.160 --> 00:34:59.530
Japan would later surrender as well as allied victory.

686
00:34:59.531 --> 00:35:02.950
It was secured nearly half a million people throughout the British and I'm

687
00:35:02.951 --> 00:35:05.830
fireable soldiers and civilians had died in World War II.

688
00:35:06.160 --> 00:35:09.130
These losses where significant though admittedly Britain hadn't much fewer

689
00:35:09.131 --> 00:35:11.890
losses and other nations such as Germany or the Soviet Union,

690
00:35:12.130 --> 00:35:15.190
Britain which was able to maintain its independence and empire throughout the

691
00:35:15.191 --> 00:35:18.460
war,
did not emerge from it as cocky as it has been.
World War One,

692
00:35:18.610 --> 00:35:22.000
world war two was the deadliest single conflict in human history and it had

693
00:35:22.001 --> 00:35:25.150
reshaped the world significantly including the British Empire,

694
00:35:25.480 --> 00:35:29.350
the u s n Ussr both oppose the European and therefore British colonialism.

695
00:35:29.350 --> 00:35:32.110
But in order to slow the spread of communism and attempt to prevent it from

696
00:35:32.111 --> 00:35:35.410
spreading into Britain's former colonies as its hold to them weekend,

697
00:35:35.440 --> 00:35:39.660
US would support the gradual of Britain from its colonies rather than complete

698
00:35:39.661 --> 00:35:43.440
total sudden independence as the u s took indirect control over many.

699
00:35:43.500 --> 00:35:45.210
And the Soviets of course,
got to others.

700
00:35:45.360 --> 00:35:48.930
Britain's tactic regarding the loss of its colonies was quite a bit different

701
00:35:48.960 --> 00:35:51.420
than was seen with a nation such as France,

702
00:35:51.450 --> 00:35:54.510
which fought brutal war is against many of his former colonies to try to retain

703
00:35:54.511 --> 00:35:54.870
them.

704
00:35:54.870 --> 00:35:58.710
Britain was more tolerant and accepting of the fact that it was losing control

705
00:35:58.740 --> 00:36:00.460
over many of them.
Although Britain too,

706
00:36:00.461 --> 00:36:04.020
it did feel a needs to retain some of its colonies such as the Suez Canal in

707
00:36:04.021 --> 00:36:07.560
Egypt and when engaged in conflict.
There were some,
but again,
as I said,

708
00:36:07.590 --> 00:36:10.080
not as significantly as a nation such as France.

709
00:36:10.260 --> 00:36:12.990
Britain had accepted that it was no longer the world superpower,

710
00:36:13.020 --> 00:36:16.080
but these efforts were undertaken with the intention of keeping Britain alive as

711
00:36:16.081 --> 00:36:17.190
a major world power.

712
00:36:17.310 --> 00:36:21.000
The Suez crisis in the early 1950s was indeed one of the British Empire's and

713
00:36:21.001 --> 00:36:22.110
Francis for that matter.

714
00:36:22.111 --> 00:36:25.710
The last attempts to retain its imperial authority throughout the world as it

715
00:36:25.711 --> 00:36:28.890
failed,
the British attempts to reclaim the empire were largely bus pursuit,

716
00:36:28.891 --> 00:36:31.620
especially as Canada,
Australia,
India,
and New Zealand.

717
00:36:31.621 --> 00:36:35.310
Much of Africa and the Middle East and Southeast Asia had been lost most all of

718
00:36:35.311 --> 00:36:38.760
them.
By the year 1970 these nations were still tied to Britain,

719
00:36:38.761 --> 00:36:41.940
to the Commonwealth of nations which was formed as Britain declared as colonies

720
00:36:41.941 --> 00:36:43.320
has equals to the United Kingdom.

721
00:36:43.321 --> 00:36:47.700
In 1949 the Commonwealth remains to this day and Queen Elizabeth the second

722
00:36:47.701 --> 00:36:50.670
England's current monarch remains the monarch of many nations,

723
00:36:50.671 --> 00:36:53.460
including Australia,
Canada,
South Africa,
New Zealand.

724
00:36:53.580 --> 00:36:55.200
Although this is of course traditional,

725
00:36:55.201 --> 00:36:58.590
she didn't holds very little political influence in these nations back home in

726
00:36:58.591 --> 00:37:01.050
Britain.
However,
life was not quite so bad.

727
00:37:01.080 --> 00:37:04.150
The standard of living following the rebuilding after where the were up to,

728
00:37:04.151 --> 00:37:07.410
but significantly raises leading many people from Britain's former colonies to

729
00:37:07.411 --> 00:37:09.180
want to immigrate to Britain.
As I mentioned,

730
00:37:09.181 --> 00:37:12.510
the withdrawal of European powers from their former colonies let the vacuums

731
00:37:12.511 --> 00:37:15.690
which the United States and Soviet Union tried to fill as part of their tension

732
00:37:15.691 --> 00:37:18.390
and rivalries,
referred to as the Cold War,

733
00:37:18.510 --> 00:37:22.260
the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland as it was and is

734
00:37:22.261 --> 00:37:26.310
referred to to to stay a lead member in the United Nations.
And a NATO,

735
00:37:26.311 --> 00:37:29.760
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and military alliance set up to counter

736
00:37:29.761 --> 00:37:33.180
the Warsaw Pact was thrown into the midst of this cold war.

737
00:37:33.300 --> 00:37:37.080
Britain would be involved in or state support for at least many of the United

738
00:37:37.080 --> 00:37:38.340
States has conflicts during the war,

739
00:37:38.341 --> 00:37:42.690
such as the Korean War into which Britain sent about 15,000 troops following the

740
00:37:42.691 --> 00:37:46.410
50s and the 60s the economy of Britain was beginning to reach record levels of

741
00:37:46.411 --> 00:37:48.180
unemployment and economic decline,

742
00:37:48.390 --> 00:37:52.750
not sharing in the longevity of rejuvenation that the United States would enjoy,

743
00:37:52.770 --> 00:37:55.470
and quite frankly,
it's still enjoying falling World War II.

744
00:37:55.830 --> 00:37:57.450
Following the election of Margaret Thatcher,

745
00:37:57.451 --> 00:38:00.750
the first female British prime minister,
the economy would take a turn upwards.

746
00:38:00.840 --> 00:38:03.780
In 1991 the Soviet Union had fallen Britain,

747
00:38:03.900 --> 00:38:07.050
which would a bear to significant amount of the fight in a potential military

748
00:38:07.051 --> 00:38:08.610
confrontation with communist power,

749
00:38:08.700 --> 00:38:12.270
which could have ultimately spiraled into a third world war or even a nuclear

750
00:38:12.271 --> 00:38:15.540
war.
Breathe a sigh of relief.
Six years later.

751
00:38:15.570 --> 00:38:19.980
In 1997 the British empire would come to an official and as Britain's

752
00:38:19.981 --> 00:38:23.610
surrendered rendered Hong Kong to the People's Republic of China,
that same year,

753
00:38:23.611 --> 00:38:27.600
Wales and Scotland were granted their own parliaments in recent times.
In fact,

754
00:38:27.601 --> 00:38:29.470
Scotland has even made a bid for independence,

755
00:38:29.550 --> 00:38:32.790
which would bring an end to the union held in place since James the first and

756
00:38:32.791 --> 00:38:36.880
fourth the Scottish independence referendum about the endeavor for Britain to

757
00:38:36.881 --> 00:38:40.990
leave the European Union referred to as Brexit in 2015 did not fail.

758
00:38:41.590 --> 00:38:46.240
England today remains one of the world's most important nations as it deals with

759
00:38:46.241 --> 00:38:49.810
a political disagreements,
economic crises,
world disorders and conflicts,

760
00:38:49.811 --> 00:38:52.150
and all the troubles which plague our modern world.
Today,

761
00:38:52.151 --> 00:38:55.840
it appears quite certain that England is not going anywhere from its position as

762
00:38:55.841 --> 00:38:59.170
a respectable,
powerful,
dignified,
and distinguished nation,

763
00:38:59.320 --> 00:39:01.690
and we'll most certainly play a role in things to come.

764
00:39:02.140 --> 00:39:05.800
The history of England from tribal societies on a mysterious island without

765
00:39:05.801 --> 00:39:08.470
writing to the largest empire the world had ever seen,

766
00:39:08.471 --> 00:39:11.860
could not be truly respected within the time span of only around two hours,

767
00:39:11.861 --> 00:39:13.770
which this video has taken the outline it,

768
00:39:14.230 --> 00:39:17.290
but I hope that I have provided a sufficient outline into the major events in

769
00:39:17.291 --> 00:39:19.660
continuous motion of England and its empire.

770
00:39:19.990 --> 00:39:23.470
A history of which I find is not commonly addressed as one great spam,

771
00:39:23.471 --> 00:39:25.810
but rather as isolated moments within the greater,

772
00:39:25.811 --> 00:39:27.820
more complex history that we've outlined today.

773
00:39:27.910 --> 00:39:31.030
The enduring effects and legacy of England and the British empire is

774
00:39:31.031 --> 00:39:34.210
indisputably significant,
but admittedly controversial.

775
00:39:34.330 --> 00:39:37.720
England retains a unique culture of beautiful and rich language is strong

776
00:39:37.721 --> 00:39:40.690
identity.
It considers itself a protector,
freedom,
peace,

777
00:39:40.691 --> 00:39:42.310
and other such ideals around the world.

778
00:39:42.340 --> 00:39:46.150
In a shining example of western philosophy and civilization at home,

779
00:39:46.360 --> 00:39:50.290
the British empire more than any other nation spread modern civilization across

780
00:39:50.291 --> 00:39:53.740
the globe successfully along with its language and culture and things such as

781
00:39:53.741 --> 00:39:55.660
that.
While many places in Africa,

782
00:39:55.690 --> 00:39:59.020
the Middle East and Asia on Dolly benefited from British rule Wilner course to

783
00:39:59.021 --> 00:39:59.860
modernization.

784
00:40:00.190 --> 00:40:03.040
The ways in which Britain went about establishing the colonial rule.

785
00:40:03.041 --> 00:40:07.020
A company frowned upon as it was often subjugation of local peoples was only at

786
00:40:07.021 --> 00:40:10.930
the benefit of Britain in mind without much regard to the native benefit from

787
00:40:10.931 --> 00:40:11.764
British rule.

788
00:40:12.130 --> 00:40:15.550
Even within Britain regarding England's rural and countries like Scotland and

789
00:40:15.551 --> 00:40:19.870
Wales and Ireland.
Questions have been raised about the morality of the role.

790
00:40:19.930 --> 00:40:23.440
I won't go too far into these points beyond saying that unquestionably England

791
00:40:23.441 --> 00:40:27.220
is responsible for greatly benefiting the world as well as being the perpetrator

792
00:40:27.221 --> 00:40:31.210
of many things which we today would consider criminal that would encourage you

793
00:40:31.300 --> 00:40:34.630
given the information provided here and for information from numerous other

794
00:40:34.631 --> 00:40:35.464
sources,

795
00:40:35.590 --> 00:40:39.790
but I encourage you to look into to form your own independent opinions regarding

796
00:40:39.791 --> 00:40:43.570
the entirety of England and its empire.
I believe it's fair to say though,

797
00:40:43.571 --> 00:40:44.351
without England,

798
00:40:44.351 --> 00:40:47.260
the world would not be the place that it is today and England's history is

799
00:40:47.261 --> 00:40:49.120
undoubtably.
Therefore worth exploring,

800
00:40:49.121 --> 00:40:52.480
especially as we view England's decisions regarding the future.

801
00:40:52.570 --> 00:40:54.610
