00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:01.890
Hello and welcome to the fire of learning.

2
00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:05.040
I'm Justin [inaudible] and today we're going to be discussing the political

3
00:00:05.041 --> 00:00:05.874
compass.

4
00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.680
There are many charts and graphs used to help plot of political orientation,

5
00:00:10.681 --> 00:00:12.180
but the political compass,

6
00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.990
a system which plots or position on a Cartesian coordinate plane is becoming

7
00:00:15.991 --> 00:00:17.340
more and more popular.

8
00:00:17.341 --> 00:00:20.670
So we're going to be talking about how it works and what it represents.

9
00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:23.070
Quick Note,
before we get started,

10
00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:26.670
I understand politics is always a sensitive topic and right now,

11
00:00:26.671 --> 00:00:30.510
political tension may be very high.
So as always,

12
00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:34.530
I'm going to be as impersonal about this as possible and not press my own

13
00:00:34.531 --> 00:00:36.930
opinions in any way or form.
Basically,

14
00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.020
if you have no idea at all where I am on the spectrum,

15
00:00:40.021 --> 00:00:44.700
by the end of the video and I've done my job correctly.
All right,
so as I said,

16
00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.020
there are many charts people have made to try to organize political orientations

17
00:00:49.021 --> 00:00:53.070
over the years.
Some are more basic,
some are more complex.

18
00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.510
The political compass seems to have become popular because it's complex enough

19
00:00:57.511 --> 00:00:59.790
to give appreciable detail and accuracy,

20
00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.730
but isn't so complex that it's esoteric.

21
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.030
The exact creators are unknown but its origins land,

22
00:01:06.031 --> 00:01:10.860
www.politicalcompass.org and the website also offers a test that help

23
00:01:10.861 --> 00:01:13.710
individuals place themselves on the coordinate plane.

24
00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:19.230
The test has been criticized as being too limited and having a left wing bias.

25
00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.270
Whether or not that's true is you our opinion,

26
00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:23.340
but regardless of whether or not that's true,

27
00:01:23.341 --> 00:01:27.480
the compass itself has expanded beyond the website into mainstream use,

28
00:01:27.481 --> 00:01:30.960
especially on the Internet.
Here's how it works.

29
00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:36.230
The y axis or the up and down has to deal with the authority of the government.

30
00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.200
Whether you prefer a hands on government,
Authoritarians,

31
00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.420
ISM or a hands off government libertarianism.

32
00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:47.340
On the very bottom you have variance of anarchism and on the top you have

33
00:01:47.341 --> 00:01:49.050
variance of totalitarianism.

34
00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.040
People who score on the top half tend to believe that a strong government is

35
00:01:53.041 --> 00:01:57.030
ideal and necessary to a well functioning society.
The higher up you go,

36
00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.160
the more decisions you would interest the government with.

37
00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:02.790
People who score in the upper quadrants are more likely to believe that the

38
00:02:02.791 --> 00:02:04.770
government may not always be right or perfect,

39
00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:09.150
but placing major decisions in the hands of informed incompetent leaders is

40
00:02:09.151 --> 00:02:10.410
what's best for everyone.

41
00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:14.550
They're more likely to adhere to philosophy which supports his social contract.

42
00:02:14.551 --> 00:02:18.780
That contract,
which proponents argue is signed by everyone at birth.

43
00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.780
The argument made is that the state grants people rights,

44
00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:25.290
freedoms opportunities and other benefits and accomplishments of civilized

45
00:02:25.291 --> 00:02:28.440
society and protects them.
In exchange.

46
00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:32.310
People agree to be loyal to the country and a here to the country's laws and

47
00:02:32.311 --> 00:02:35.100
customs regarding specific issues.

48
00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:39.000
The ideologies at the top tend to favor centralized governments,

49
00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:43.680
strong militaries and police forces,
government intervention in the economy.

50
00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:46.410
Generally more government programs and support.

51
00:02:46.411 --> 00:02:50.820
More laws intended to keep people safe as can probably be inferred.

52
00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:55.200
Ideologies at the very top tend to suggest that society's best when the state is

53
00:02:55.201 --> 00:02:56.700
making all the major decisions.

54
00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:01.000
People who score on the bottom half tend believe that personal liberty and small

55
00:03:01.001 --> 00:03:05.410
government,
our ideal unnecessary to a well functioning society.
The lower you go,

56
00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:06.940
the more decisions you would interest.

57
00:03:06.941 --> 00:03:11.050
Common people with people who score in the lower quadrants are more likely to

58
00:03:11.051 --> 00:03:13.720
believe that though people are not always right or perfect,

59
00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:17.740
their personal freedom is of the highest importance in that everyone taking

60
00:03:17.741 --> 00:03:21.190
personal responsibility for the decisions and making decisions that affect

61
00:03:21.191 --> 00:03:24.160
everyone democratically is what's best for everyone.

62
00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:28.510
They are more likely to adhere to philosophy,
which the course free association,

63
00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:32.320
believing that the state is not what grants rights,
freedoms,
opportunities,

64
00:03:32.321 --> 00:03:34.780
and other benefits and accomplishments of civilized society,

65
00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:38.410
but that these rights are given to everyone by birth and that the job of the

66
00:03:38.411 --> 00:03:42.640
state is to merely do the bare minimum to protect people's freedom regarding

67
00:03:42.641 --> 00:03:43.690
specific issues.

68
00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:47.590
Ideologies at the bottom tend to favor an economy that runs itself naturally.

69
00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:51.970
A small military possibly even relying on militias and believe that society

70
00:03:51.971 --> 00:03:56.890
should have as few laws as possible as Ken probably be inferred.

71
00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:01.300
Ideologies at the very bottom tend to suggest that government is altogether

72
00:04:01.301 --> 00:04:05.290
unnecessary and propose a variety of methods for how society could exist and

73
00:04:05.291 --> 00:04:08.980
function normally without the state.
Around the middle of the two,

74
00:04:08.981 --> 00:04:12.910
people tend to believe in a strong government which is subservient to the will

75
00:04:12.911 --> 00:04:15.610
of the people and probably elected democratically.

76
00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:19.330
Now the x axis and the left and the right.

77
00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:23.710
This is intended to deal with economic position and it's a little bit less

78
00:04:23.711 --> 00:04:27.760
straightforward and the y axis because economics is actually somewhat often

79
00:04:27.761 --> 00:04:32.650
misrepresented as in black and white subject when it is in fact very diverse and

80
00:04:32.651 --> 00:04:37.300
sometimes very complicated.
Essentially the farther left you go,

81
00:04:37.301 --> 00:04:40.210
the more you desire the economy to be run cooperatively,

82
00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:41.410
the farther right you go,

83
00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:44.650
the more you desire for the economy to be run competitively.

84
00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:49.390
Basically on the right you have free market economies and variance of
capitalism.

85
00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:53.230
On the left you have collectivist economies and variants of socialism.

86
00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:56.680
On the very far right,
you have complete free market capitalism.

87
00:04:57.220 --> 00:04:59.590
On the very far left you have complete communism.

88
00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:03.700
People who score on the left tend to be more aligned with the various

89
00:05:03.701 --> 00:05:08.020
philosophies of socialism and it is more appropriate to refer to leftist as

90
00:05:08.021 --> 00:05:11.860
socialists than communists because communism and socialism,

91
00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:13.360
or not necessarily the same thing,

92
00:05:13.361 --> 00:05:17.740
but more precisely coming ism is a kind of socialism and socialism is an

93
00:05:17.741 --> 00:05:20.140
umbrella term for multiple economic ideologies,

94
00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:23.770
which are all intended to give the working class control of what are called the

95
00:05:23.771 --> 00:05:24.910
means of production.

96
00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:28.990
The means of production refers basically to the resources that are given society

97
00:05:28.991 --> 00:05:33.640
or community or whatever has and its ability to use those resources to create

98
00:05:33.641 --> 00:05:34.474
products.

99
00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:38.830
Left scores tend to believe that the economy should be specifically set up to

100
00:05:38.831 --> 00:05:42.490
favor the majority of people and offer a few suggestions on how this should be

101
00:05:42.491 --> 00:05:44.830
done.
Who is responsible for organizing?

102
00:05:44.831 --> 00:05:48.760
Depends on where scores fit on the y axis,
which I'll get to in a moment,

103
00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:53.410
but the intention is roughly for the working class who benefit from this labor

104
00:05:53.411 --> 00:05:54.244
as a group.

105
00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:59.180
Left scores have higher tendencies of that economic burdens or something which

106
00:05:59.181 --> 00:06:00.410
can be overcome.

107
00:06:00.411 --> 00:06:04.220
If the economy of a nation is revised from what they see as a hierarchal top

108
00:06:04.221 --> 00:06:06.140
down to a horizontal equality,

109
00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:10.250
allowing people to focus on more rewarding and fulfilling enterprises and

110
00:06:10.251 --> 00:06:12.530
creating what they see as an ideal society.

111
00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:16.610
Typically left scores tend to believe that you only own what you're actually

112
00:06:16.611 --> 00:06:17.690
using.
Now,

113
00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:20.780
this doesn't mean necessarily that you're expected to be stripped down to the

114
00:06:20.781 --> 00:06:23.270
bare minimum,
but owning,
for example,

115
00:06:23.271 --> 00:06:27.140
a few acres of land or especially a store that you've never even been to would

116
00:06:27.141 --> 00:06:32.030
definitely be frowned upon by leftist.
In standard communist theory.
For example,

117
00:06:32.031 --> 00:06:36.650
the jobs and resources of a given group are divided equally among the workers or

118
00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:37.603
in other words,

119
00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:42.470
promote the phrase from each according to ability to each according to need.

120
00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:46.850
Following this philosophy,
if an area of land rich in iron were discovered,

121
00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:49.070
the iron belongs to everyone in the community.

122
00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:53.270
Everyone shares the burden of extracting it either voluntarily or out of

123
00:06:53.271 --> 00:06:55.700
obligation to the state depending on your y axis.

124
00:06:55.701 --> 00:06:59.870
Again and everyone has an equal right to take with a need from the products.

125
00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:03.710
Right.
Scores tend to believe that the economy should be set up to favor more

126
00:07:03.711 --> 00:07:07.850
unregulated exchange between people of a given group.
There are again,

127
00:07:07.851 --> 00:07:11.540
a few suggestions on how this has to be done and exactly what is meant by

128
00:07:11.541 --> 00:07:15.710
unregulated is very dependent on where scores fish on the y axis,

129
00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:20.660
but the intention is roughly to have the economy driven by free exchange in

130
00:07:20.661 --> 00:07:22.340
competition,
right.

131
00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:26.210
Scores have higher tendencies of believing the competition and free exchange

132
00:07:26.211 --> 00:07:30.410
lead to better products and much more efficient allocation of resources.

133
00:07:30.770 --> 00:07:32.960
Property rights covered by capitalism,

134
00:07:32.961 --> 00:07:36.470
which basically state that what you own is what your own with reference to the

135
00:07:36.471 --> 00:07:41.120
specific details of how a given society works allow people to profit from

136
00:07:41.121 --> 00:07:42.470
resources that they own,

137
00:07:42.471 --> 00:07:45.890
which they believe causes higher rates of innovation and distribution.

138
00:07:46.310 --> 00:07:50.600
The top down hierarchy of capitalism they tend to believe is not necessarily

139
00:07:50.601 --> 00:07:53.780
structured.
I'm privileged,
but opportunity and hard work.

140
00:07:54.110 --> 00:07:58.010
The opportunity to climb the economic ladder causes people to work harder and

141
00:07:58.011 --> 00:08:02.660
harder work rates,
as I said,
in their opinion,
a better workforce,
better products,

142
00:08:02.661 --> 00:08:06.350
and better allocation of resources,
which creates an ideal society.

143
00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:08.870
In standard capitalists theory.
For example,

144
00:08:08.871 --> 00:08:11.870
an individual may own an area of land rich and iron.

145
00:08:12.710 --> 00:08:16.670
The iron belongs to that individual,
but so did the burdens of extracting it.

146
00:08:17.030 --> 00:08:21.410
The individual typically exchange something.
Usually nowadays currency for money,

147
00:08:21.411 --> 00:08:23.240
equipment and payment for the miners,

148
00:08:23.241 --> 00:08:26.690
a he or she will hire to extract it and then with the extracted iron we'll

149
00:08:26.691 --> 00:08:29.840
typically sell it on the market in exchange for other things.
Again,

150
00:08:29.900 --> 00:08:34.430
nowadays currency,
it's not also a straight forward as that.
However,

151
00:08:34.550 --> 00:08:36.140
in the middle of the two for example,

152
00:08:36.141 --> 00:08:39.710
ideologies exists such as a mutualism in which workers on the means of

153
00:08:39.711 --> 00:08:43.460
production collectively but good.
They're still exchange on the free market.

154
00:08:43.910 --> 00:08:47.420
There are a very important differences between the forest sides which had been

155
00:08:47.421 --> 00:08:48.254
created here.

156
00:08:48.770 --> 00:08:52.460
Typically they're referred to as the author Terrian left the authoritarian,

157
00:08:52.461 --> 00:08:55.200
right.
The libertarian left and the libertarian right.

158
00:08:55.380 --> 00:08:58.860
Each has a significantly different perspective on how the world works.

159
00:08:59.100 --> 00:09:02.670
The left will criticize the right for bread molding and grocery stores.

160
00:09:02.671 --> 00:09:04.050
While there are hungry outside,

161
00:09:04.110 --> 00:09:07.380
the right will criticize a less for conditions which create bread lines and

162
00:09:07.381 --> 00:09:11.220
hunger.
The bottom will criticize a top or being controlling and invasive.

163
00:09:11.221 --> 00:09:15.390
The top will criticize and bottom for being inefficient and scattered within the

164
00:09:15.391 --> 00:09:18.660
spectrum are all sorts of answers to all sorts of problems.

165
00:09:18.780 --> 00:09:22.230
There are not always clear or easy answers to the problems of the world,

166
00:09:22.290 --> 00:09:25.350
which has led to the political diversity that we see here.

167
00:09:25.860 --> 00:09:27.510
Now having settled all of that,

168
00:09:27.511 --> 00:09:31.500
I think the best way to navigate the compass is to position relatively well

169
00:09:31.501 --> 00:09:36.180
understood politics.
Science.
With a large portion of my viewers being American,

170
00:09:36.270 --> 00:09:38.070
we'll use American politics for now.

171
00:09:38.850 --> 00:09:42.810
The two main parties of the United States are the Democrats and the Republicans,

172
00:09:42.811 --> 00:09:47.340
also known as the Liberals and the Conservatives based off of other charts and

173
00:09:47.341 --> 00:09:48.031
such things.

174
00:09:48.031 --> 00:09:52.860
We'll put the liberals here and the Conservatives here for the averages.

175
00:09:53.580 --> 00:09:54.930
They are,
as you can see,

176
00:09:54.931 --> 00:09:58.560
relativity clothes but significantly distanced in the same quadrant.

177
00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:02.580
To elaborate.
They both typically believe in a decent amount of government.

178
00:10:02.581 --> 00:10:06.300
It's just a whole different expectations for what the government is and isn't

179
00:10:06.301 --> 00:10:07.380
allowed to interfere with.

180
00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:12.560
An obvious example is the economy which explains the gap and right to left with

181
00:10:13.141 --> 00:10:15.150
reference to the entire chart here.

182
00:10:15.180 --> 00:10:18.210
One could easily call both liberals and conservatives capitalists,

183
00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:22.050
but liberals tend to favor more government programs and intervention and things

184
00:10:22.051 --> 00:10:26.550
of that nature.
These two parties only represent about half the nation actually.

185
00:10:26.551 --> 00:10:31.551
However many Americans identify as independents or unaffiliated with other

186
00:10:31.591 --> 00:10:34.620
party.
For the majority of those people.
However,

187
00:10:34.650 --> 00:10:38.310
this means they swing between issues placed on the party averages here.

188
00:10:38.430 --> 00:10:39.450
Based off of that,

189
00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:43.770
one could infer the probably over three fourths of American fit within this red

190
00:10:43.771 --> 00:10:48.150
box here.
There are also some prominent third parties in the United States.

191
00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:53.240
The two main ones are the Libertarians and the Greens will put the American

192
00:10:53.550 --> 00:10:55.410
Libertarian Party here and the Green party here.

193
00:10:55.650 --> 00:10:59.550
The Libertarian party is generally not comprised of extreme libertarians.

194
00:10:59.551 --> 00:11:02.910
They don't quite fit into the bottom quadrant,
but they border closely.

195
00:11:03.030 --> 00:11:05.520
The Greens are slightly less controlling to than liberals.

196
00:11:05.521 --> 00:11:07.050
When it comes to government authority,

197
00:11:07.470 --> 00:11:09.690
but government authority is necessary kids in,

198
00:11:09.691 --> 00:11:13.020
and they're usually much more focused on government programs and things of that

199
00:11:13.021 --> 00:11:15.810
nature.
To the point of bordering on mild socialism,

200
00:11:16.740 --> 00:11:20.520
a very substantial portion of the United States population fits into the

201
00:11:20.521 --> 00:11:23.010
authoritarian right quadrant.
And interestingly,

202
00:11:23.130 --> 00:11:26.580
we can see that a miniature graph could be created within a top right quadrant.

203
00:11:27.090 --> 00:11:30.900
Let's clot some very relevant leaders on here from this election and last

204
00:11:30.901 --> 00:11:35.700
election to help clarify Donald Trump,
ted Cruz,
Barack Obama,

205
00:11:35.701 --> 00:11:39.780
Hillary Clinton,
Bernie Sanders,
Gary Johnson,
Ron Paul,
and Jill Stein.

206
00:11:40.950 --> 00:11:44.550
Again,
as you can see,
despite the differences between everyone here,

207
00:11:44.551 --> 00:11:47.220
that all basically fit with an the top right quadrant.

208
00:11:47.370 --> 00:11:48.900
You may disagree with that claim,

209
00:11:48.901 --> 00:11:52.050
but because a huge portion of Americans are in the top right quadrant,

210
00:11:52.051 --> 00:11:55.030
they wouldn't be electable if they weren't as well.
No.

211
00:11:55.050 --> 00:11:58.950
A lot of graphs actually put,
for example,
Bernie Sanders and Jill Stein,

212
00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:01.630
a left quadrants to put Ron Paul down towards,

213
00:12:01.631 --> 00:12:04.870
and Arco capitalism will put Donald Trump right up next to Hitler.

214
00:12:05.350 --> 00:12:07.540
So if you're going to be looking at these charts online,

215
00:12:07.570 --> 00:12:11.530
be aware that exaggeration in bias are very common on them.

216
00:12:11.830 --> 00:12:15.820
Let's plot some other ideologies here to gain a better understanding of what's

217
00:12:15.821 --> 00:12:20.180
going on here.
We have the and Arco,
socialists and Arco.

218
00:12:20.181 --> 00:12:23.890
Socialists typically favor the destruction of the state and replacing it with

219
00:12:23.891 --> 00:12:28.000
horizontal electives,
which very instructor depending on specific ideology,

220
00:12:28.210 --> 00:12:31.030
but the main ideology here is an article communism.

221
00:12:32.050 --> 00:12:35.650
Here you'd have the anarcho capitalists moments you have here.
Also,

222
00:12:35.651 --> 00:12:40.300
it will be that the state is unnecessary and our capitalists believe that people

223
00:12:40.301 --> 00:12:43.840
are able to live in society and maintain the capitalist free market without the

224
00:12:43.841 --> 00:12:48.190
knee of a state.
You have up here more Marxists thinking.

225
00:12:48.191 --> 00:12:52.630
One of the main Marxist ideologies is Marxism,
Leninism,
which will place here.

226
00:12:53.380 --> 00:12:57.550
Now this can be a bit trickier because traditionally Marxist Leninist believe is

227
00:12:57.551 --> 00:13:01.360
strong workers.
State isn't necessary to overcome capitalism at first,

228
00:13:01.420 --> 00:13:04.960
but then gradually the government should back off as the work has become more

229
00:13:04.961 --> 00:13:08.980
anarchistic.
Others believe on holding onto a strong state in definitely,

230
00:13:08.981 --> 00:13:12.610
which is responsible for directing what they see as the liberation of the

231
00:13:12.611 --> 00:13:17.140
working class into socialist economics up here.
Also towards authoritarianism,

232
00:13:17.141 --> 00:13:21.970
we can place fascism.
Fascism is typically about giving the reigns,
the state,

233
00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:26.740
but economically fascist can be more divided.
Some are more socialists,

234
00:13:26.741 --> 00:13:28.060
some are more capitalists,

235
00:13:28.061 --> 00:13:32.170
so the average fits about here to match famous recent world leaders and

236
00:13:32.171 --> 00:13:36.550
philosophers and such.
With this,
we can add Hitler,
Stalin,
George Washington,

237
00:13:36.610 --> 00:13:41.200
Thomas Jefferson,
Noam Chomsky,
Milton Friedman,
and Margaret Thatcher.

238
00:13:42.520 --> 00:13:46.420
I hope that this has given you a good sense of how all this fits together,

239
00:13:46.450 --> 00:13:48.610
but there is a major problem with his chart.

240
00:13:49.030 --> 00:13:53.560
The chart is pretty much strictly looking at level of government authority and

241
00:13:53.561 --> 00:13:54.490
economic leaps.

242
00:13:54.491 --> 00:13:57.970
It's not the greatest at looking at the intricacy of social philosophy and

243
00:13:57.971 --> 00:14:02.770
policy.
Technically speaking,
an individual who is very socially liberal,

244
00:14:02.830 --> 00:14:06.700
but we use in gay marriage,
feminism is pro choice,
et Cetera,

245
00:14:07.270 --> 00:14:10.480
but a strong authoritarian government and complete free market.

246
00:14:10.481 --> 00:14:12.280
Capitalism belongs here.

247
00:14:12.700 --> 00:14:17.230
Likewise and individual who believes the anticommunist model of society is

248
00:14:17.231 --> 00:14:17.830
ideal,

249
00:14:17.830 --> 00:14:22.420
but is prolife antifeminist white nationalists who would fit around here.

250
00:14:22.421 --> 00:14:23.290
Technically speaking,

251
00:14:23.980 --> 00:14:28.240
person a was socially not identify with the far right person,
be with Sophie,

252
00:14:28.241 --> 00:14:29.650
not identify with the far left,

253
00:14:30.100 --> 00:14:33.790
but on this chart they're matched when outside of his chart they considered on

254
00:14:33.791 --> 00:14:38.320
different ends of the spectrum,
so this chart is not perfect.

255
00:14:38.500 --> 00:14:41.020
It's meant to be more general or introductory.

256
00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:43.150
To really understand political differences.

257
00:14:43.151 --> 00:14:45.300
You have to look at ideologies individually.

258
00:14:45.970 --> 00:14:48.400
For more videos like this and videos on many other subjects,

259
00:14:48.401 --> 00:14:51.950
we shouldn't take out fire of learning and subscribe.
Thank you for watching.

260
00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:52.670
By the way,

261
00:14:52.670 --> 00:14:57.070
fire of learning is on Facebook and now Instagram links of both are in the

262
00:14:57.080 --> 00:14:57.913
description.

263
00:14:58.310 --> 00:15:01.580
I plan to use social media to post things that I wouldn't really dedicate a

264
00:15:01.581 --> 00:15:06.510
whole video to such as interesting facts and information or relevant updates to

265
00:15:06.511 --> 00:15:07.344
the channel.

266
00:15:08.280 --> 00:15:09.113
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

267
00:15:09.130 --> 00:15:13.810
<v 0>I've had a page for the channel on Facebook for a while now and I'll be honest,</v>

268
00:15:13.811 --> 00:15:15.280
I hate the Facebook page set up.

269
00:15:15.340 --> 00:15:19.000
You go on your page and you're suddenly spammed with all these insights and tips

270
00:15:19.001 --> 00:15:22.720
on how to function a page and just owning a page on there has definitely gotten

271
00:15:22.721 --> 00:15:23.590
worse over the years.

272
00:15:23.591 --> 00:15:27.190
But I will definitely try to use that in Instagram from now on.

273
00:15:27.430 --> 00:15:28.650
So thank you again for watching.
