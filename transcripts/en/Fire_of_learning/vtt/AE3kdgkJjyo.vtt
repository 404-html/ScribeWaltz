1
00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:04.800
Titan southerners largest moon and in fact the second largest moon in the solar

2
00:00:04.801 --> 00:00:09.490
system after Ganymede isn't amazing and mysterious world of its own being larger

3
00:00:09.491 --> 00:00:13.290
in fact and the planet mercury,
it's often seen as a planetary moon.

4
00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:17.460
What's interesting though is a titan is the only moon in the solar system with a

5
00:00:17.461 --> 00:00:21.810
dense atmosphere so dense in fact,
that if a human were to strap on wings,

6
00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.130
they could take off flying.

7
00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.520
It is also the only other body in the solar system besides earth,

8
00:00:26.521 --> 00:00:28.770
with bodies of liquids on surface,

9
00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.420
so tied in a large rocky body with a dense atmosphere and rainfall that feeds

10
00:00:33.421 --> 00:00:37.200
lakes and rivers.
When scientists first really begin to observe the moon,

11
00:00:37.201 --> 00:00:41.880
they were struck by its similarity to earth.
What's missing life of course,

12
00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:46.620
or is it this striking similarity to places on earth and the fact that we still

13
00:00:46.621 --> 00:00:50.910
have yet to properly examine tighten means many scientists are speculating that

14
00:00:50.911 --> 00:00:53.940
life on titan could be possible,
but there's a problem.

15
00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:59.090
Titan's surface temperature is negative 179 degrees Celsius or negative 290

16
00:00:59.131 --> 00:01:03.930
degrees Fahrenheit.
Accordingly,
the liquid on titans,
not water.
It's methane,

17
00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:05.670
which is a gas here on earth.

18
00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:09.240
To answer the question of whether or not life on Titan could exist,

19
00:01:09.241 --> 00:01:13.770
you must ask cause methane replace water as a solvent and alien life.
Well,

20
00:01:13.771 --> 00:01:18.360
many scientists have doubts for why is water such a good elixir of life?
Well,

21
00:01:18.361 --> 00:01:20.280
it comes down to the atomic level.

22
00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.240
Water is h two o meaning an oxygen atom with two hydrogen atoms.

23
00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.320
This means one side of the molecule is positively charged and the other side is

24
00:01:28.321 --> 00:01:30.630
negatively charged.
Why is that important?
Well,

25
00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:35.040
this polarity helps water dissolves things and mixed them up in this works

26
00:01:35.041 --> 00:01:38.760
especially well with carbon based life forms like you and me and every living

27
00:01:38.761 --> 00:01:39.960
organism on this planet.

28
00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.250
Assuming of course you are a carbon based life form an alien,
and by the way,

29
00:01:44.251 --> 00:01:47.490
scientists are skeptical of life forms that are not carbon based,

30
00:01:47.491 --> 00:01:50.970
such as silicon based life forms,
but anyway,
methane,

31
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.770
however is c h for a carbon atom accompanied by four hydrogen atoms.

32
00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.970
Accordingly,
it's not polar like water is and can't dissolve things.

33
00:01:59.971 --> 00:02:03.330
That living organism would need into a soup quite as well.

34
00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:07.740
Basically the current understanding of life doesn't make it seem very likely,

35
00:02:07.741 --> 00:02:12.210
but our current understanding of life is based off only one example.

36
00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.440
Therefore,

37
00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.700
life on Titan would have to exist in a way that we don't yet fully understand.

38
00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:21.720
Finding it there with not only revolutionize our understanding of biology by the

39
00:02:21.721 --> 00:02:22.980
discovery of alien life,

40
00:02:22.981 --> 00:02:26.920
but it would open the door to an even greater and more diverse range of life

41
00:02:26.921 --> 00:02:30.390
forms in the universe if our carbon and water loving selves,

42
00:02:30.391 --> 00:02:34.290
we're not the only kind of life around.
And so when are we going back to Titan?

43
00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:35.030
Well,

44
00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:40.030
NASA and the European Space Agency proposed a mission called the t s s m a titan

45
00:02:40.351 --> 00:02:41.640
Saturn system mission,

46
00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.970
which would have included a hot air balloon and a lander on Titan.

47
00:02:44.971 --> 00:02:49.380
But in 2009 and Jupiter mission wasn't given precedence over this mission and a

48
00:02:49.381 --> 00:02:50.880
Saturn mission was set back.

49
00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:53.310
