Hello and welcome to fire of learning.

2
00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:07.420
It is remarkable to look at how much of an influence the Roman Empire had in

3
00:00:07.421 --> 00:00:10.140
shaping European society and beyond.

4
00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:14.400
One of Rome's greatest legacies is it's language Latin.

5
00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:16.950
Even after the western Latin speaking,

6
00:00:16.951 --> 00:00:21.951
half of the Roman Empire fell and forest 76 a d Latin continued on for over a

7
00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.890
millennium as the language of the Roman Catholic Church Science,

8
00:00:25.891 --> 00:00:27.990
philosophy and medicine and related fields,

9
00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.980
the language of law and more apart from its own a direct use.

10
00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:36.420
It is also importantly the parent language of a number of European languages

11
00:00:36.421 --> 00:00:40.650
spoken.
Today,
the most prominent of these are Italian,
Spanish,

12
00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:41.490
Portuguese,

13
00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:46.490
French and Romanian with no small influence in our own English language as well.

14
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.980
In this video,
we are going to take a look into the history,

15
00:00:49.981 --> 00:00:53.280
structure and condition of the Latin language.

16
00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.810
Why is it a dead language?
How did it influence all these other languages?

17
00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.200
How do you actually pronounce the words?
Well,
let's get to it.

18
00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:09.670
Before we begin,
I would like to thank Stephen Langton,

19
00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:14.320
Max Youngson or Jansen and Jacob wants her being our most recent patrion

20
00:01:14.321 --> 00:01:15.100
supporters.

21
00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:19.450
They join the supporters listed here that help make these videos possible.

22
00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:23.680
The origins of the Latin language are rather mysterious.

23
00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:27.040
It no doubt predates the founding of the city of Rome itself,

24
00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:32.070
which according to legend occurred in April of seven 53 BC Latin came to Italy

25
00:01:32.651 --> 00:01:37.420
with an Indo European people call the Latins who settled in Italy around the

26
00:01:37.421 --> 00:01:39.940
year 1000 to BC.
However,

27
00:01:39.941 --> 00:01:44.941
this Latin is separated from the Latin of Julius Caesar's Day by around a

28
00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:47.230
thousand years and was no doubt quite different.

29
00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:50.380
We can get a glimpse of that by the first Latin writing.

30
00:01:50.381 --> 00:01:54.760
Scholars have found data to the seventh century BC shown here.

31
00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:00.130
It looks like Greek and it kind of is literally the alphabet we use in English

32
00:02:00.131 --> 00:02:05.050
and most European languages is for very good reason called the Roman or Latin

33
00:02:05.051 --> 00:02:08.560
alphabet because it came to us through Rome.
However,

34
00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:11.890
that alphabet came from an ancient Greek alphabet,

35
00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:16.420
which was lit or mimicked by the peoples of Italy's,
such as the,
uh,
trust skins,

36
00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:21.100
the long forgotten middleman between Greece and Rome from the Etruscans.

37
00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:25.600
The Romans learned how to write their Latin down in a way that looked like this

38
00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:30.190
and that alphabet over time morphed into our own one because of Rome.

39
00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:34.120
So if the Roman alphabet is the alphabet of your native language,

40
00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:36.460
you can thank them.
Believe it or not,

41
00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:41.290
these alien markings are the direct ancestors of that alphabet with words we use

42
00:02:41.291 --> 00:02:42.880
everyday carved within.

43
00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:48.390
Look at this here from the Blackstone dating to around 600 BC for example.

44
00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:51.640
It's written right to left like ancient.
The trust in was,

45
00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:53.680
it hadn't changed to left to right yet,

46
00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:58.710
but upon examination we can see that this word is reiki related to the rex,

47
00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:01.750
which meant a king in Latin,

48
00:03:01.751 --> 00:03:06.751
which gives us words like Regal and regulate and related words in other related

49
00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:10.000
languages.
Fascinating.
However,

50
00:03:10.001 --> 00:03:13.840
we unfortunately have limited information on this ancient writing.

51
00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:18.910
Most Roman writing still in existence comes from classical Latin,

52
00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:21.130
what we call classical.
Latin,

53
00:03:21.131 --> 00:03:25.600
slowly evolved from ancient Latin over centuries in the natural evolution that

54
00:03:25.601 --> 00:03:29.200
language has tended to follow and seems to have been standardized around the

55
00:03:29.201 --> 00:03:31.000
year 100 BC.

56
00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:35.980
The first century BC was the age of Morrie's Cicero,
Virgil,

57
00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:40.750
Julius and Augustus Caesar and many other Roman figures who wielded the Latin

58
00:03:40.751 --> 00:03:44.050
language like a weapon and who's quotes you may be familiar with.

59
00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:47.950
Here's a quote you've probably heard.
It's Julius Caesar.

60
00:03:47.951 --> 00:03:51.850
Of course it means I came,
I saw,
I conquered.

61
00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:56.590
Here's an important question though.
How do you pronounce that phrase?

62
00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:01.840
We are tempted to say venae [inaudible].
That's usually how we hear it anyway,

63
00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:06.340
but in fact,
Julius Caesar said,
Wei nee,
we be Wiki.

64
00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:08.800
This brings us to some confusion.

65
00:04:08.801 --> 00:04:12.910
That is pretty common when talking about Latin that we should probably address

66
00:04:12.911 --> 00:04:15.460
before we go deeper.
As many of you know,

67
00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:18.940
the last video I made was a history of the Roman empire.
Now,

68
00:04:18.941 --> 00:04:20.650
if you haven't seen that,
don't worry.

69
00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:24.010
You don't have to watch that video to understand this one.
However,

70
00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:27.610
the way I pronounced the number of words in that video will lead to some

71
00:04:27.611 --> 00:04:29.350
confusion in the comments section.

72
00:04:29.351 --> 00:04:33.400
Some people were actually fairly unhappy about the way I pronounce things.

73
00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:37.870
My pronunciations though I admit we're probably tainted by my English speaking

74
00:04:37.871 --> 00:04:40.000
American accent or pretty much correct.

75
00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:43.150
Although I also admit that I was lazy with the short and long vowels.

76
00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:45.430
It really just boils down to a misunderstanding.

77
00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:50.670
There is a notable difference between classical Latin but the Romans spoke and

78
00:04:50.741 --> 00:04:52.780
ecclesiastical Latin,

79
00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:57.760
a dialect of Latin and I suppose you could say a subgroup of what we call folder

80
00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:02.820
Latin that developed in medieval Europe and was heavily influenced by Italian.

81
00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:05.110
When we hear spoken Latin,

82
00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:10.090
the majority of the time we hear ecclesiastical Latin or some form of a more

83
00:05:10.091 --> 00:05:11.770
modern full girl Latin,

84
00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:16.060
not just with things related to Catholicism but even with as you can see Roman

85
00:05:16.061 --> 00:05:16.810
phrases.

86
00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:21.190
Part of the reason for that is that ecclesiastical Latin is perhaps and was

87
00:05:21.191 --> 00:05:25.480
definitely more common in recent centuries and makes more sense pronunciation

88
00:05:25.481 --> 00:05:26.470
wise to us.

89
00:05:26.471 --> 00:05:30.250
English speakers will talk about ecclesiastical Latin and vulgar Latin and

90
00:05:30.251 --> 00:05:34.510
general in a moment for now.
How did the Romans pronounce things?

91
00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:37.990
I don't know how many of you are going to learn the whole language so I won't

92
00:05:37.991 --> 00:05:39.760
bore you with the minute details,

93
00:05:39.761 --> 00:05:43.540
but here are the main points to pronouncing Latin like the Romans did.

94
00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:46.630
See is always hard like a k sound,

95
00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:51.010
never an s or chip sound.
Caesar is actually Kaiser.

96
00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:53.830
Again,
an ecclesiastical Latin.
This is different.

97
00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:56.770
If you've heard the Lord's prayer in Latin,

98
00:05:56.890 --> 00:06:00.140
they'll typically say paternoster queerness in Charlie's.

99
00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:03.410
The Romans would have pronounced Chili's as Kylie's.

100
00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:06.410
The word column is the word for Sky or heaven.

101
00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:10.550
We'll get to why the word changes in a second.
G is always hard as well,

102
00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:11.540
like a good sound.

103
00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:16.460
Never like a Joe h was pronounced it softly like [inaudible] article.

104
00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:20.840
Though it is suggested that the elite paid more attention to this while the

105
00:06:20.841 --> 00:06:25.000
lower classes tended to ignore the age Maday odd periodical.

106
00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:26.360
The Adriatic Sea.

107
00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:30.290
Jay is always like a why sound the Romans didn't have Jay though.

108
00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:35.000
They generally had an eye and a vowel in place of it.
Take for example,
UDS,

109
00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:39.920
UDS Kaiser to the Caesar.
He octa,
Aliyah Yuck test.

110
00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:42.470
The die is cast.
Are is trilled.

111
00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:47.180
The Romans called this steely Tara [inaudible] pet dog letter because it sounds

112
00:06:47.181 --> 00:06:51.410
like a snarling dog.
Roma Rome,
Rome willows,

113
00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:56.860
Ramidus v before val like you probably noticed is pronounced like a w.

114
00:06:57.380 --> 00:07:01.550
However,
v also served the purpose of a,
you sound around consonants.

115
00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:03.830
The Romans didn't differentiate between the two.

116
00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:07.430
That's why there were these in place of views on some monuments and things

117
00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:12.460
written in Latin where he toss the word for truth was you plural.

118
00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:17.330
The letters Y in z were incorporated into Latin to use for Greek words,

119
00:07:17.331 --> 00:07:18.680
which the Romans picked up.

120
00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:23.090
Perhaps the only civilization that the Romans respected as much as themselves

121
00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:28.070
was the ancient Greeks and over time,
many Greek words made their way into Latin.

122
00:07:28.130 --> 00:07:28.881
To this day,

123
00:07:28.881 --> 00:07:33.230
actually the letter y and French and some other romance languages as I

124
00:07:33.231 --> 00:07:36.230
understand it is called Eclac degree Chi.

125
00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:39.620
Regarding vowels there are short and long ones.

126
00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:42.560
Sometimes the long ones are marked with a kind of accent,

127
00:07:42.590 --> 00:07:47.210
a Macron or sometimes the val has doubled or sometimes marked with a capital

128
00:07:47.211 --> 00:07:52.211
letter and sometimes often not marked at all as the macrons weren't used until

129
00:07:52.461 --> 00:07:57.020
after rounds fall.
This can be important in some circumstances though,

130
00:07:57.050 --> 00:08:01.010
like in the word lead better,
which means book and leave better,

131
00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:04.110
which means free.
Diphthongs ay,

132
00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:08.270
he is pronounced eye like eyeball,
the battle of Kanye,

133
00:08:08.510 --> 00:08:09.320
Kaiser.

134
00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:14.270
Keep in mind Kaiser in Latin and Kaiser and German sound very similar,

135
00:08:14.300 --> 00:08:18.350
not by coincidence.
Aau is pronounced out like house.

136
00:08:18.430 --> 00:08:20.300
I'll boosters Augustus,

137
00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:24.140
our room cold because of these rules and these differences.

138
00:08:24.170 --> 00:08:27.440
You can hear the name Cujo and Ecclesiastical Latin.

139
00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:32.680
Get Goodall and classical Latin and Cicero and our own English pronunciation.

140
00:08:33.230 --> 00:08:36.320
None of these pronunciations are necessarily incorrect,

141
00:08:36.350 --> 00:08:40.910
but I do believe it's important to be aware of the differences and the fact that

142
00:08:40.911 --> 00:08:43.630
this guy's name in his time was kicked ghetto.

143
00:08:43.750 --> 00:08:45.590
We'll come back to kick it all in a moment.

144
00:08:45.710 --> 00:08:49.880
Let's get back to the history of Latin lads and continued its long reign over

145
00:08:49.881 --> 00:08:54.110
much of the western known world as the dominant language of the Roman Empire.

146
00:08:54.170 --> 00:08:58.530
Though keep in mind,
in the eastern half,
Greek was very commonly spoken.

147
00:08:58.531 --> 00:09:01.800
Dan was in effect a second language of the Roman Empire.

148
00:09:02.070 --> 00:09:06.510
As the Roman empire expanded,
many different dialects emerged.

149
00:09:06.630 --> 00:09:11.100
These forms which differed from the educated aristocratic classical Latin spoken

150
00:09:11.101 --> 00:09:15.900
in Rome are called vulgar.
Latin meaning common or vernacular Latin,

151
00:09:15.990 --> 00:09:17.460
not ugly Latin,

152
00:09:17.490 --> 00:09:21.960
although the aristocracy may have considered it as such in foreign parts of the

153
00:09:21.961 --> 00:09:24.570
empire like Gall Hispana in Britain,

154
00:09:24.870 --> 00:09:29.550
this vulgar Ludden often contained elements from the local native languages like

155
00:09:29.551 --> 00:09:31.950
Golish in Gaul,
modern France,

156
00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:36.120
and the centuries following the collapse of the western Roman Empire enforced 76

157
00:09:36.121 --> 00:09:40.290
[inaudible].
When European societies became more insular and detached,

158
00:09:40.530 --> 00:09:44.790
these dialects were essentially left on their own to develop further and in

159
00:09:44.791 --> 00:09:49.140
these more insular and detaches societies through centuries of mistakes,

160
00:09:49.170 --> 00:09:54.090
slangs interactions with other languages and intentional changes in the early

161
00:09:54.091 --> 00:09:58.350
Middle Ages around the eighth century.
We see of course the beginning of,

162
00:09:58.380 --> 00:10:02.460
as I said,
not only French,
Italian,
Spanish,
et Cetera,

163
00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:05.340
develop from Latin,
but also a lot of other languages,

164
00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:10.060
regional languages in Spain,
France,
Italy,
et cetera.
Maybe I should say Attica,

165
00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:14.550
Teta,
some of which still exist today.
Cattlemen and Catalonia,

166
00:10:14.580 --> 00:10:19.230
Spain,
Sardinian and Sardinia,
Italy,
so Denny and by the way,

167
00:10:19.231 --> 00:10:23.760
is actually the closest to Latin of these languages and the Walloon language in

168
00:10:23.761 --> 00:10:26.490
France and Belgium in case we were wondering,

169
00:10:26.491 --> 00:10:30.690
there were also some Latin based languages that developed in North Africa,

170
00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:34.320
but they were wiped out by a future conquerors and we don't know much about
them.

171
00:10:34.620 --> 00:10:38.220
The imprint of Latin is all over the AFA mentioned languages.

172
00:10:38.430 --> 00:10:40.860
They share quite a bit of grammar,
structure,

173
00:10:40.861 --> 00:10:45.720
lists of vocabulary words with not only Latin but also with each other.

174
00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:46.673
True Story.

175
00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:49.740
A couple of years back when I was getting deeper into studying French,

176
00:10:49.770 --> 00:10:50.940
I was playing a video game,

177
00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.180
heard a sentence in Italian and understood it perfectly.

178
00:10:54.210 --> 00:10:57.210
It was a more complex sentence too.
I think it used the subjunctive mood.

179
00:10:57.330 --> 00:10:59.160
I didn't know any Italian.
I still don't,

180
00:10:59.190 --> 00:11:03.180
but that is actually common among speakers of romance languages and the deed

181
00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:07.260
learning one romance language would make learning another much easier because

182
00:11:07.261 --> 00:11:08.640
they're so related.
By the way,

183
00:11:08.641 --> 00:11:11.280
let me know in the comments if any of you native speakers have had those

184
00:11:11.281 --> 00:11:12.540
experiences as well,

185
00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:16.260
but for now let's look at some examples to highlight this point.
Firstly,

186
00:11:16.290 --> 00:11:19.710
the numbers in Latin Unos duo,

187
00:11:19.890 --> 00:11:22.020
today's quatre queen,

188
00:11:22.021 --> 00:11:26.880
quick six Septum or Octo,
no m Dec.

189
00:11:27.180 --> 00:11:31.890
Compare those to the equivalents of these romance languages listed here and

190
00:11:31.891 --> 00:11:36.360
again,
French is the only language I can confidently compare to a lot in myself.

191
00:11:36.390 --> 00:11:41.370
Everything else I googled body parts,
brain got to have heart core,

192
00:11:41.460 --> 00:11:45.910
hand,
Montas foot pace I oculus,

193
00:11:46.890 --> 00:11:50.010
weather,
rain,
fluid cloud,

194
00:11:51.300 --> 00:11:55.170
some solar,
wind went Snell.

195
00:11:55.450 --> 00:11:59.620
Next foods,
water,
aqua milk,

196
00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:03.520
lack bread.
Bond is salt,

197
00:12:03.830 --> 00:12:08.470
salt Lee's wine,
Wean them.
We can really do this all day.

198
00:12:08.710 --> 00:12:13.330
It's because of the similarities that some linguists argue that Latin isn't a

199
00:12:13.331 --> 00:12:18.220
dead language.
Many would say that old English for example,
isn't a dead language.

200
00:12:18.221 --> 00:12:22.990
Exactly.
It's just an outdated form of what evolve to be current English.

201
00:12:23.110 --> 00:12:27.310
Someone said the same thing about Latin,
French,
Spanish,
Portuguese,

202
00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:31.960
all just evolved forms of Latin.
Speaking of speaking old English,

203
00:12:31.990 --> 00:12:33.130
just looking at it here,

204
00:12:33.131 --> 00:12:36.970
you can ask why is it so different from our current English?
Well,

205
00:12:36.971 --> 00:12:38.590
there are a number of reasons why,

206
00:12:38.650 --> 00:12:42.100
but one big one is it's missing a lot of Latin.

207
00:12:42.250 --> 00:12:47.020
I would estimate that about half give or take of our language comes from

208
00:12:47.170 --> 00:12:50.710
directly or indirectly Latin.
Why?
Well,

209
00:12:50.860 --> 00:12:55.300
back to the history throughout the Middle Ages and renaissance Latin remain the

210
00:12:55.301 --> 00:12:59.050
language of the Catholic Church.
It still is a major language of the church,

211
00:12:59.051 --> 00:13:01.810
but being the language of religion in those ages,

212
00:13:01.811 --> 00:13:05.370
it was naturally tied into being the language of the nobility,

213
00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:08.110
the language of science,
language of law,
et Cetera.

214
00:13:08.290 --> 00:13:10.180
People would speak their own languages,

215
00:13:10.210 --> 00:13:15.040
but reading and writing was often done in Latin and Lesser Dante from this high

216
00:13:15.041 --> 00:13:17.230
status and use in such fields,

217
00:13:17.380 --> 00:13:20.440
we have a lot of words which come directly from Latin.

218
00:13:20.590 --> 00:13:22.600
Quite a few other European languages,

219
00:13:22.601 --> 00:13:27.190
less related to Latin were also affected in the sense like German,
Russian,

220
00:13:27.191 --> 00:13:29.710
Finnish,
and Hungarian.
It's because of this,

221
00:13:29.711 --> 00:13:34.330
that Latin words and our language tend to sound very big and professional.

222
00:13:34.690 --> 00:13:38.650
Ursa major,
big bear,
Nebula,
fog,

223
00:13:39.190 --> 00:13:41.560
Corpus Callosum,
tough body,

224
00:13:41.890 --> 00:13:46.870
much of the Latin and English however comes from an indirect source.

225
00:13:46.990 --> 00:13:51.990
Norman French prior to the year 10 66 English was a very dramatic language.

226
00:13:53.830 --> 00:13:58.830
Roman British Latin did not sit well with a later invaders from Germany to Anglo

227
00:13:58.990 --> 00:14:02.740
Saxons and largely disappeared English and the early Middle Ages was more

228
00:14:02.741 --> 00:14:07.120
related to Saks and German and the Norse languages.
Thanks to the Vikings.

229
00:14:07.480 --> 00:14:11.530
There was some Latin because of the AFA mentioned reasons and because he ancient

230
00:14:11.531 --> 00:14:13.750
Germans had picked up some from the Romans,

231
00:14:13.780 --> 00:14:16.840
but the big crossover came with the Normans,

232
00:14:16.870 --> 00:14:21.870
a mixed French and Norse people who invaded England in the year 10 66 they spoke

233
00:14:23.291 --> 00:14:28.291
a dialect of early French and from there we get lists of words and restructuring

234
00:14:28.361 --> 00:14:33.361
of the grammar and such things which come indirectly from Latin is English or

235
00:14:34.001 --> 00:14:37.120
romance language.
Then you can make a case for it I suppose,

236
00:14:37.121 --> 00:14:41.050
but it's really more like a close cousin that hangs out more with German and

237
00:14:41.051 --> 00:14:41.884
Dutch.

238
00:14:45.340 --> 00:14:47.200
There are some parts of Latin,
however,

239
00:14:47.201 --> 00:14:51.040
which are a little more unusual and we're probably forgotten for that.

240
00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:56.630
One of the most striking features for beginner learners is there isn't a word

241
00:14:56.631 --> 00:15:01.130
for the or a and word order isn't really important.

242
00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:04.430
Some languages like Russian,
I believe it can be a little like this,

243
00:15:04.431 --> 00:15:09.431
but Latin is an unusually highly inflected language.

244
00:15:09.860 --> 00:15:14.720
Inflection basically means words are modified to display their meaning in a

245
00:15:14.721 --> 00:15:15.440
sentence.

246
00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:19.640
We have this a little bit in English like in the form of verb conjugation.

247
00:15:19.700 --> 00:15:21.140
I see you see,

248
00:15:21.141 --> 00:15:26.141
he sees adding the s at the end there to show the third person is inflection,

249
00:15:26.660 --> 00:15:28.340
but Latin goes much farther.

250
00:15:28.550 --> 00:15:32.870
Let's take a simple sentence to display this who?
Ella,
we'd debt.

251
00:15:32.950 --> 00:15:33.770
Glad them.

252
00:15:33.770 --> 00:15:38.410
The girl sees the boy who Ella means girl would.

253
00:15:38.411 --> 00:15:41.420
That means cs from the infinitive.

254
00:15:41.480 --> 00:15:46.190
We data and Poo Adam a means.
Boy.
We can flip this around though.

255
00:15:46.191 --> 00:15:50.540
However we want with debt.
Who?
Adam?
For Wella,

256
00:15:50.810 --> 00:15:53.960
we read this as sees the boy,
that girl,

257
00:15:54.320 --> 00:15:59.320
but it's grammatically correct in Latin and still means the girl sees the boy.

258
00:15:59.720 --> 00:16:03.350
Now what we want to change the meaning and say the boy sees the girl,

259
00:16:03.410 --> 00:16:08.030
it would be [inaudible] would that [inaudible].
As you can see,

260
00:16:08.060 --> 00:16:12.710
the endings of changed on the nouns and that is because nouns like this change

261
00:16:12.711 --> 00:16:14.900
depending on their position in the sentence,

262
00:16:15.110 --> 00:16:19.720
that word order isn't very important.
Meaning is derived from the word endings,

263
00:16:19.730 --> 00:16:20.780
not the word order.

264
00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:24.740
Obviously that's kind of a foreign concept to a language like English where word

265
00:16:24.741 --> 00:16:26.420
order is very important.

266
00:16:26.480 --> 00:16:30.410
I suppose I should mention though that in normal circumstances the Romans did

267
00:16:30.411 --> 00:16:34.490
have a preference of subject,
object,
verb,
word order,
but again,

268
00:16:34.580 --> 00:16:36.980
not necessary.
It's fun to learn about,

269
00:16:36.981 --> 00:16:40.070
but when you had to memorize all the endings in high school,

270
00:16:40.071 --> 00:16:44.810
I have to admit it got old sometimes trying to put sentences together.

271
00:16:45.230 --> 00:16:49.790
This is all pretty cool for a dead language.
Is Latin really a dead language?

272
00:16:49.820 --> 00:16:51.890
What is a dead language?
Well,

273
00:16:52.310 --> 00:16:57.310
there's a big difference between a dead language and an extinct language.

274
00:16:57.470 --> 00:17:00.190
An extinct language is a language like a trust skin.

275
00:17:00.320 --> 00:17:04.730
A trust gun was virtually lost for centuries and is only really familiar today.

276
00:17:04.760 --> 00:17:05.840
Two scholars,

277
00:17:05.930 --> 00:17:09.860
no one speaks it or uses it to communicate and it doesn't really have any

278
00:17:09.861 --> 00:17:13.340
linguistic,
could descendants a dead language,
however,

279
00:17:13.520 --> 00:17:18.520
is simply a language which has no native speakers and isn't used in daily life.

280
00:17:19.430 --> 00:17:23.000
A common misconception is that a dead language is one that you can't speak

281
00:17:23.001 --> 00:17:26.450
anymore and therefore Latin is only written.
That's not true.

282
00:17:26.451 --> 00:17:30.140
People could verbally communicate with Latin if they wanted to.
The pope,

283
00:17:30.141 --> 00:17:30.741
for example,

284
00:17:30.741 --> 00:17:35.741
does another misconception is that Latin is frozen in time and not changing and

285
00:17:36.171 --> 00:17:39.200
this is why it's a dead language.
This is also not true.

286
00:17:39.420 --> 00:17:42.350
Latin is and has kept up with the times,

287
00:17:42.650 --> 00:17:44.430
take the words or did they not throw,

288
00:17:44.690 --> 00:17:49.560
which means computer or did a full Niamh Puerto [inaudible] cell phone.

289
00:17:49.710 --> 00:17:52.710
Latin is all over the place,
indirectly and directly.

290
00:17:52.711 --> 00:17:56.310
It is still used by the Catholic church,
still using science,

291
00:17:56.370 --> 00:18:01.170
still used by scholars,
still used in law.
It's a language still in use,

292
00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:05.640
but it's not a language in regular daily use like English or Russian or
Japanese.

293
00:18:05.700 --> 00:18:10.350
It's kept alive because it's Latin and it's important the cultures whose

294
00:18:10.351 --> 00:18:15.120
ancestors once used it.
So yes,
it is a dead language,

295
00:18:15.210 --> 00:18:18.090
but in more ways than one it lives on.

296
00:18:19.350 --> 00:18:21.900
I hope you enjoyed this video.
If you did,

297
00:18:21.960 --> 00:18:25.440
I'd invite you to come check out some other core content we have here on fire

298
00:18:25.450 --> 00:18:29.850
learning like the history of Rome video that this video is tied to coming up in

299
00:18:29.851 --> 00:18:33.090
the future.
We have the history of Rome,
part two.

300
00:18:33.150 --> 00:18:36.750
It will be titled the fall of the Roman empire and then at a future date,

301
00:18:36.780 --> 00:18:37.860
