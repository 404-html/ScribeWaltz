Oh,

2
00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:19.330
have you ever wondered how ships,

3
00:00:19.331 --> 00:00:22.900
which can waste such large amounts managed to stay a float on water while you

4
00:00:22.901 --> 00:00:25.690
cannot walk on water?
Well,

5
00:00:25.691 --> 00:00:29.740
the answer isn't too complicated in this water vessel technology has been around

6
00:00:29.741 --> 00:00:34.740
for thousands of years.
We'll start with something called buoyancy burns.

7
00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:36.540
He is,
he had barely for an Arabic to Florida,

8
00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:41.350
top of body of water or another liquid or even air and object's ability to flow.

9
00:00:41.351 --> 00:00:44.860
It depends on its density relative to the density of water,

10
00:00:44.861 --> 00:00:49.510
not necessarily its size or total weight.
For example,
uh,

11
00:00:49.511 --> 00:00:54.100
sheet of aluminum foil crumbled into a ball sinking a body of water if dense

12
00:00:54.101 --> 00:00:58.330
enough or a fun role to be flat.
The same aluminum foil float.

13
00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:02.140
This is because of something called Archimedes principle.

14
00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:06.540
Archimedes of Syracuse was a Greek scientists to discover this and his bathtub.

15
00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:07.450
According to legend,

16
00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:11.930
it basically states at the buoyancy or floating force exerted on a body immersed

17
00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.430
in fluid is equal to the weight of the fluid which the body displaces.

18
00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:20.400
Therefore,
a thousand ton ship must be built wildly enough to displace it.

19
00:01:20.401 --> 00:01:23.710
Thousand Times of water.
If it's not,
it will sink.

20
00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:27.400
And if the ship or to carry too much cargo,
it would again,
sink.

21
00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:32.710
Ships are hollow filled with there and bill to displace water.
You however,

22
00:01:32.711 --> 00:01:36.910
cannot walk on water because you were at to dance while standing.
However,

23
00:01:36.911 --> 00:01:41.290
float on your back and you will of course be able to from our video on physics,

24
00:01:41.291 --> 00:01:42.880
science in general,
and much more.

I'd invite you to subscribe and check out my channel and also be sure to check

26
00:01:46.831 --> 00:01:48.950
out Royal Navy ball on Facebook.

27
00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.650
It's video was made possible through their support and if you're interested in

28
00:01:52.651 --> 00:01:55.990
in shifts,
they post frequently about the Royal Navy of the United Kingdom,

29
00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:01.090
one of the greatest navies to ever set sail.
Thank you for watching.
