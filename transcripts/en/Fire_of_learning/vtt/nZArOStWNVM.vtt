00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:04.290
Hello and welcome to fire of learning in our education system.

2
00:00:04.291 --> 00:00:06.840
History does for sure account as a core class,

3
00:00:06.841 --> 00:00:10.050
but it's often considered less important than other fields like science,

4
00:00:10.051 --> 00:00:13.020
technology and math.
The reasoning is obvious.

5
00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:15.030
Science and math look toward the future.

6
00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.400
They create jobs and are good for the economy,

7
00:00:17.401 --> 00:00:21.120
which is what our public education system is all about.
Meanwhile,

8
00:00:21.121 --> 00:00:22.860
history looks toward the past.

9
00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:27.690
So today I want to ask what benefit to the presence and the future is there in

10
00:00:27.691 --> 00:00:32.040
looking at the past?
Well,
there are indeed several benefits to studying history.

11
00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:33.001
One,

12
00:00:33.001 --> 00:00:37.290
in my opinion is that it satisfies the urge that many of us as humans have to

13
00:00:37.291 --> 00:00:41.900
belong to something greater than ourselves.
The politics we debate in government,

14
00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.930
we live under our economics,
our religion,
our language,
or for most people,

15
00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:50.910
languages,
our technology,
our names where we live or holidays,
our clothing,

16
00:00:50.911 --> 00:00:54.930
our culture in general became what they did because of the thousands of years of

17
00:00:54.931 --> 00:00:57.210
history,
the exchange of ideas,

18
00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:01.440
the interactions between peoples and the clashing of empires aren't just boring.

19
00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.050
Records of things that happened long before we were born,

20
00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:05.910
their events and to large,

21
00:01:05.911 --> 00:01:10.290
ceaseless story directly responsible for who and what you are and where and how

22
00:01:10.291 --> 00:01:14.040
you live.
A large portion of my ancestors were French Canadian.

23
00:01:14.041 --> 00:01:17.250
They were some of the first colonists in new France and helps build what became

24
00:01:17.251 --> 00:01:21.390
Acadia and Quebec.
Some of my ancestors were Anglo Irish nobility,

25
00:01:21.391 --> 00:01:23.310
which makes me related to rubber boil.

26
00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.600
Some of them were simple Welsh quarry men who came here and just built America.

27
00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.220
I get two things from knowing this.
The first is a sense of pride and belonging.

28
00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.060
Even though I can't take credit for anything my ancestors did and even though I

29
00:01:36.061 --> 00:01:39.960
wasn't there for any of it,
I still feel that through understanding them,

30
00:01:39.961 --> 00:01:44.100
I belonged to the larger framework of human civilization,
I.
E.

31
00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.790
Something larger than myself,
closely related to that,
but beyond that,

32
00:01:47.791 --> 00:01:51.660
I feel that understanding myself and my place in the world means understanding

33
00:01:51.661 --> 00:01:55.170
their record of events.
That led up to my existence,
not just human history.

34
00:01:55.171 --> 00:01:58.170
Even looking at things like all the way back at the big bang satisfies the

35
00:01:58.171 --> 00:02:02.340
desire,
but human history is of course the most relatable and most recent,

36
00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.860
but all right,
say you don't really care about this,

37
00:02:04.861 --> 00:02:06.170
you don't have these interests in.

38
00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:10.020
You prefer to focus on the future more than finding this meaning and the past

39
00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:12.330
history is still beneficial.

40
00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:17.130
It's an incredibly useful record of mistakes we've made as individuals and as

41
00:02:17.131 --> 00:02:18.870
nations that we can avoid repeating.

42
00:02:18.871 --> 00:02:22.470
If we take the time to objectively analyze what went wrong.

43
00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:26.670
I would go so far as to say that someone who doesn't know history and is trying

44
00:02:26.671 --> 00:02:30.930
to have a major influence on this world is akin with 30 year old trying to live

45
00:02:30.931 --> 00:02:35.610
a good life even though they forgotten 75% of their memories prior to that
point.

46
00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:40.230
You may have to learn all over again.
Don't touch the stove when it's hot.

47
00:02:40.231 --> 00:02:44.730
Don't put a stick in the moving bike wheel,
etc. We can invade Russia,

48
00:02:44.731 --> 00:02:48.060
but keep in mind that the Russians have against the Swedish,
the French,

49
00:02:48.061 --> 00:02:49.200
the Germans and others,

50
00:02:49.201 --> 00:02:53.430
one wars at least in part because they let their very harsh winters decimate

51
00:02:53.431 --> 00:02:58.200
foreign troops.
So if we're going to invade Russia,
let's keep that in mind.

52
00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:59.920
That's a very level example.

53
00:02:59.921 --> 00:03:03.610
I don't know how many of you are applying to invade Russia,
but as I said,

54
00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:07.570
there's plenty of knowledge which can be used in the hands of the individual.

55
00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:11.320
If you want to be rich,
if you want to hold a political office,

56
00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:15.460
if you want it to be a great author or command or scientist or something of that

57
00:03:15.461 --> 00:03:20.050
sort,
you can look at people who were successful in that field.
In the past,

58
00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:23.410
Machiavelli recommends imitating the roles of successful people throughout

59
00:03:23.411 --> 00:03:26.230
history to achieve the same level of success.

60
00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:30.550
Napoleon Bonaparte has a very famous quote about how he as a very successful

61
00:03:30.551 --> 00:03:34.540
general and emperor recommends looking over the conquest of great historic

62
00:03:34.541 --> 00:03:37.750
military leaders like Alexander and Hannibal and other such figures.

63
00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:39.850
To be great in such a field.

64
00:03:39.851 --> 00:03:44.200
It's necessary to understand the mindset that people throughout history have to

65
00:03:44.201 --> 00:03:48.190
examine and contrast conditions that these similar people found themselves in

66
00:03:48.191 --> 00:03:52.210
and those in which you find yourself and to get a good idea of what it takes to

67
00:03:52.211 --> 00:03:56.050
be like them and have similar levels or greater levels of success.

68
00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:00.620
Many of those answers are found and history on an even smaller scale in this

69
00:04:00.621 --> 00:04:03.910
stolen and knowledge of history is crucial and something like the voting polls

70
00:04:03.911 --> 00:04:07.600
and the market and understanding of history may allow you to have a greater

71
00:04:07.601 --> 00:04:10.780
understanding of the conditions of your nation and help you make a responsible

72
00:04:10.781 --> 00:04:15.130
decision in voting for a candidate that your fellow voters are not aware of and

73
00:04:15.131 --> 00:04:18.760
understanding what technologies affects people most significantly and why,

74
00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:21.760
what products people want and when and why they want them.

75
00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:26.900
What are the signs of economic stability or coming catastrophe appear to be you?

76
00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:31.480
For sure.
Again,
a competitive edge in the world brought to you again by history.

77
00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:36.460
As is often said,
those who do not remember the past are doomed to repeat it.

78
00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:37.720
<v 1>Okay.</v>

79
00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:39.700
<v 0>For more videos like these and videos on many other subjects.</v>

80
00:04:39.701 --> 00:04:41.800
We should have checked out fire of learning and subscribe.

81
00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:42.850
Thank you for watching.
