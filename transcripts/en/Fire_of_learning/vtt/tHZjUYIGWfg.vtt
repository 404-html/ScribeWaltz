00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:04.130
Hello and welcome to fire of learning.
Captain John.
Look,
the car star,

2
00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:08.190
Trek's famous next generation captain who for a Frenchman sounds suspiciously

3
00:00:08.191 --> 00:00:12.360
very English.
I made catchphrase is like make it so and tea.

4
00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:16.440
Earl grey hot are profound pieces of advice brought to us from the situations

5
00:00:16.441 --> 00:00:19.800
that he and the crew face throughout their journey and the lessons taught in

6
00:00:19.801 --> 00:00:23.190
Star Trek.
Even though the character and setting our fictional,

7
00:00:23.191 --> 00:00:25.860
the philosophy and meaning is applicable to the real world.

8
00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.430
So in this video we're going to explore the meaning behind 10 of his quotations

9
00:00:29.431 --> 00:00:32.700
that we may be able to apply to our own lives.
So let's get to it.

10
00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.750
Number 10 things are only impossible until they're not.

11
00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.790
Star Trek is a show where faith has been put into the existence of a future,

12
00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:45.360
a future built off social,
political,
economic,
technological,

13
00:00:45.361 --> 00:00:49.680
and other achievements that most people today think are impossible.
Granted,

14
00:00:49.681 --> 00:00:53.610
Star Trek doesn't always explain how these things were achieved and if they do,

15
00:00:53.611 --> 00:00:56.340
it's not uncommon for it to be nonsense techno babble.

16
00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.270
But it holds true in the real world as well that what we have today would have

17
00:01:00.271 --> 00:01:03.030
been thought impossible by many people in the past.

18
00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:07.410
Picard knows this and we may remember that not as much as impossible as we might

19
00:01:07.411 --> 00:01:12.030
think.
Number nine being first at any cost is not always a point.

20
00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.770
Even in the 24th century.
Some people are still obsessed with personal glory.

21
00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.850
Granted,
recognition for once achievements is not a bad thing necessarily,

22
00:01:20.851 --> 00:01:25.200
and competition in science can further progress.
However,
the galaxy,

23
00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:26.460
much like our modern world,

24
00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.140
is a very fragile place when being first costs you,
your values,

25
00:01:31.141 --> 00:01:34.410
your dignity,
your health,
even the lives of yourself and other people,

26
00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.140
you have to ask yourself,
is it really worth it?

27
00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.720
The card does a number of great things,

28
00:01:39.721 --> 00:01:43.590
but not to the risk of his crew or the downfall of his moral character.

29
00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:47.790
Number Eight,
history has proven again and again that will never,

30
00:01:47.791 --> 00:01:51.570
mankind interferes with a less developed civilization no matter how well

31
00:01:51.571 --> 00:01:55.920
intentioned that interference may be,
the results are invariably disastrous.

32
00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:00.420
The prime directive is rule number one in dealing with aliens and the galaxy

33
00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:04.290
basically don't talk to them until they meet a certain set of technological and

34
00:02:04.291 --> 00:02:08.790
scientific criteria.
If we encounter a less developed civilization,

35
00:02:08.791 --> 00:02:12.840
suddenly introducing them to star ships,
phasers transporters,
et Cetera,

36
00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:16.620
could rock the foundation of their society and the perspective of the universe,

37
00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:18.810
which could cause a societal breakdown.

38
00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:23.220
The stories of the prime directive and star trek reveal that we should treat the

39
00:02:23.221 --> 00:02:26.640
spread of technology on our planet and perhaps indeed relations with extra

40
00:02:26.641 --> 00:02:30.300
terrestrials in the future very cautiously.
Number seven,

41
00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:34.050
there is a way out of every box,
a solution to every puzzle.

42
00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:38.460
It's just a matter of finding it.
Star Trek is a problem solving show.

43
00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:39.391
To be fair,

44
00:02:39.391 --> 00:02:43.650
sometimes it's just some random solution from again a sudden Eureka moment

45
00:02:43.651 --> 00:02:45.510
explained through fake techno babble,

46
00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:50.220
but the point is not always the technicalities of solving 24th century problems,

47
00:02:50.221 --> 00:02:54.360
but the fact that the card and his crew often find themselves in situations that

48
00:02:54.361 --> 00:02:57.090
seem impossible.
They're lives are at stake.

49
00:02:57.091 --> 00:02:59.320
Their minds and bodies undergo great stress.

50
00:02:59.321 --> 00:03:01.510
They may be on the verge of losing all hope.

51
00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:05.530
We may wonder how we would react in such situations and to see them push their

52
00:03:05.531 --> 00:03:09.460
way through as an inspiration to us to push our way through our problems.

53
00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:14.110
Number six,
villains who twirl their mustaches are easy to spot.

54
00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:17.770
Those who clothed themselves in good deeds are well camouflaged.

55
00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:21.070
The road to hell is often paved with good intentions.

56
00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:24.550
Think of some of the worst people in history and perhaps some of the worst

57
00:03:24.551 --> 00:03:25.840
people you know personally.

58
00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:29.350
Very rarely do they admit to being malicious and coming out and saying,

59
00:03:29.351 --> 00:03:31.210
I shall envelop the world and evil.

60
00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:34.180
Most of the time they may claim to have good intentions.

61
00:03:34.181 --> 00:03:35.770
They may even have good intentions.

62
00:03:35.771 --> 00:03:39.670
They may be very defensive and find ways to justify the things that they do that

63
00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:40.840
some people buy into,

64
00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:44.470
but they are still doing important things and that is the charming,

65
00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:48.250
well intentioned deceptive criminals that we should prepare ourselves to

66
00:03:48.251 --> 00:03:52.150
encounter in our lives.
Less.
We play a role in what they do.
Number five,

67
00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:56.740
the road from legitimate suspicion to rampant paranoia is very much shorter than

68
00:03:56.741 --> 00:03:59.470
we think.
We may often in our lives,

69
00:03:59.471 --> 00:04:02.800
catch on to a plot or conspiracy going on around us.

70
00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:05.710
Not necessarily just on a macro political scale,

71
00:04:05.711 --> 00:04:07.960
but in our personal social lives as well.

72
00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:12.070
We have to be careful to not jump to conclusions and let our suspicions get out

73
00:04:12.071 --> 00:04:16.990
of control.
History is filled with examples where the existence of a few traders,

74
00:04:16.991 --> 00:04:17.710
for example,

75
00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:21.400
let the crackdowns on entire populations and deaths of innocent people.

76
00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:22.331
Furthermore,

77
00:04:22.331 --> 00:04:25.360
we can find that even when our suspicions have been proven to be wrong,

78
00:04:25.361 --> 00:04:29.020
the paranoia has still built up to a point where it could,
for example,

79
00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:30.880
ruin a relationship between two people,

80
00:04:30.881 --> 00:04:35.380
which must be guarded against number four.
There are times,
sir,

81
00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:38.320
when men of good conscience cannot blindly follow orders,

82
00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:41.710
you acknowledge their sentience,
but ignore the personal liberties and freedom.

83
00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:45.400
Order a man to turn his child over the state,
not while I'm as captain,

84
00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:50.080
even the United Federation of planets which presides over a peaceful earth and a

85
00:04:50.081 --> 00:04:54.370
United portion of the galaxies still has its fair share of blind bureaucrats and

86
00:04:54.371 --> 00:04:55.600
self interested figures.

87
00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:59.770
This quote refers to the Federation ordering data to submit his daughter,

88
00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:03.390
which was essentially another and joy that he had constructed and Picard

89
00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:04.293
response to it.

90
00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:08.980
History is filled with worse examples of people committing catastrophes with the

91
00:05:08.981 --> 00:05:13.420
excuse of just following orders and the cardinal leaves that men of good

92
00:05:13.421 --> 00:05:14.620
conscience as he put it,

93
00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:18.520
have an obligation to refuse orders which are morally outrageous.

94
00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:20.530
You might be reprimanded,

95
00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:24.220
but if a few other people in history have been willing to just be reprimanded,

96
00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:27.910
history might not have been so dark.
Number three,

97
00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:32.740
it is possible to commit no mistakes and still lose.
That is not a weakness.

98
00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:36.760
That is life.
Sometimes in life you may try your hardest,

99
00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:40.540
you may follow a plan exactly.
Everything else may be going perfectly,

100
00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:45.280
but you still do not succeed.
In the end.
It may not be your fault,

101
00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:48.040
although you should definitely be sure of that before you absolve yourself of

102
00:05:48.041 --> 00:05:51.550
blame.
And we may have to accept that this is just a part life.

103
00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:56.170
How we respond to failure regardless of whether or not it is our fault,

104
00:05:56.290 --> 00:06:01.010
is crucial to how our lives turn out.
Number two,
very deep within you,

105
00:06:01.011 --> 00:06:03.140
beneath all the years of pain and anger,

106
00:06:03.141 --> 00:06:05.120
there is something that has never been nurtured.

107
00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:09.050
The potential to make yourself a better man,
and that is what it is to be human,

108
00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:11.030
to make yourself more than you are.

109
00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:16.130
The card here is essentially steadying his idea of the meaning of 24th century

110
00:06:16.131 --> 00:06:18.080
life.
To improve yourself,

111
00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:21.500
to maximize his strengths and conquer your weaknesses in order to live as

112
00:06:21.501 --> 00:06:24.920
incredible of a life as you desire,
whatever kind of life that may be,

113
00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:28.650
the potential to make yourself a better person is something which paccar

114
00:06:28.651 --> 00:06:30.440
believes should be introduced to everyone.

115
00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:32.690
And if more people held that mentality,

116
00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:36.500
the world could be a place populated by better people.
Number one,

117
00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:40.880
someone once told me that time was a Predator that stocked us all our lives,

118
00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:44.840
but I rather believe that time is a companion who goes with us on the journey.

119
00:06:44.841 --> 00:06:48.110
It reminds us to cherish every moment because they'll never come again.

120
00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:52.150
What we leave behind is not as important as how we've lived after all.

121
00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:53.900
Number one,
we're only mortal.

122
00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:57.710
This is more on the route of Picard's philosophy and a meaning he gives to his

123
00:06:57.711 --> 00:07:00.620
life.
This very moment will never come again.

124
00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:02.810
Even if we have a long and healthy life.

125
00:07:02.811 --> 00:07:05.990
This exact time period in our lives will never come again.

126
00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:07.850
It only exists in the now.

127
00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:12.290
The car believes that we should make the most of our lives living as if there is

128
00:07:12.291 --> 00:07:15.530
no tomorrow isn't exactly the best quote for comparison,

129
00:07:15.590 --> 00:07:19.010
but living with the realization that your time on this earth is limited,

130
00:07:19.011 --> 00:07:22.220
is empowering to people like the card.
Captain Picard,

131
00:07:22.221 --> 00:07:26.450
of course has many other words of wisdom and Star Trek in general explores many

132
00:07:26.451 --> 00:07:30.140
other aspects of philosophy in life that are very relevant to our lives even

133
00:07:30.141 --> 00:07:32.030
though they're placed in a 24th century.

134
00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:36.530
I explore some more star trek philosophy in my video,
the philosophy of Spock,

135
00:07:36.590 --> 00:07:39.530
but to really understand all the things that star Trek covers,

136
00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:43.470
nothing beats watching the show itself except for,
you know,
discovery.

137
00:07:43.471 --> 00:07:46.460
Don't really worry about that.
But anyway,
for more videos like this,

138
00:07:46.461 --> 00:07:48.620
in videos on many other subjects,
you should have checked out,

139
00:07:48.621 --> 00:07:51.350
fire learning and subscribe.
Thank you for watching.
