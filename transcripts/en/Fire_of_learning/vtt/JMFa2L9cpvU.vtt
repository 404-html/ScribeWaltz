00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:25.360
Hello,
I'm Justin and welcome to today's episode of fire of learning.

2
00:00:25.361 --> 00:00:28.420
This episode is centered around Google translate.

3
00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:33.940
My question with this episode is how effective is Google translate at

4
00:00:33.941 --> 00:00:36.850
translating sentences from one language to another?

5
00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:42.300
And I asked this and curiosity in regards to the threat to human translation,

6
00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:47.200
by the advent of technology,

7
00:00:47.201 --> 00:00:50.680
has many professions are threatened by technology,

8
00:00:50.681 --> 00:00:54.820
especially in the 21st century.
So how effective is it?

9
00:00:54.821 --> 00:00:55.960
How accurate is it?

10
00:00:55.961 --> 00:01:00.220
And we would tell explore this and this episode by using two languages in which

11
00:01:00.221 --> 00:01:04.960
I am professional enough,
at least to notice mistakes.

12
00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:07.350
And so we're going to use French and Latin.

13
00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:13.020
So to begin we will translate offers about 91 out of 6,000 or 7,000 languages in

14
00:01:17.631 --> 00:01:22.610
the world.
And that's actually not too bad.
That's more languages then I speak.

15
00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:27.880
So begin with a simple French sentence.

16
00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:32.180
Say,
I,

17
00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:34.250
I have,

18
00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:40.760
I have a friend who can do this.

19
00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:46.190
Um,
well
they're missing a liaison right there.

20
00:01:46.191 --> 00:01:49.550
And I saw it in the beginning.
I don't know what happened to it.
But in French,

21
00:01:49.551 --> 00:01:54.551
two vowels cannot often touch says is your Enemy Cup of fair?

22
00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:59.990
Keep Perla Fair.
It should be Jay on the meat.
Keep putting a fair.

23
00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:05.090
So it's not too far.
It's actually somewhat understandable.

24
00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:10.070
But there are simple,
there's a simple grammatical error.
So

25
00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:16.630
let's do French to English and you'll have to excuse my computer is in French.

26
00:02:16.851 --> 00:02:21.200
These are the correct languages.
Um,

27
00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:28.250
how does it work with the verb?
Uh,
Marsha.

28
00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:34.610
So Marsha means to walk and we'll run it through some tenants is and see how it

29
00:02:35.411 --> 00:02:37.060
does.
So this is just an infinitive.

30
00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:42.880
Let's say you walked to Marsha Fed.

31
00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:45.890
Okay.
Correct.

32
00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:50.590
Let's make it future to marsh share.
Ah,

33
00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:55.010
you will tread.
That's changing the verb,

34
00:02:55.011 --> 00:02:59.650
but it's the same meaning let's make it conditional.
Too much.

35
00:02:59.651 --> 00:03:03.180
Sherrie,
you would walk not bad.

36
00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:05.243
Um,

37
00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:10.050
let's make it has to Marsha is isn't perfect.

38
00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:14.670
You walked.
That's accurate and

39
00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:17.350
that's impressive.

40
00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:22.360
But French is probably one of the closest languages and English currently spoken

41
00:03:22.361 --> 00:03:23.171
throughout the world.

42
00:03:23.171 --> 00:03:27.880
Popularly let's move to a language a little bit more different,

43
00:03:27.881 --> 00:03:30.490
but still somewhat similar to English,

44
00:03:30.491 --> 00:03:33.570
which is as a fore mentioned Latin.

45
00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:38.350
Now the fun thing about when is it doesn't have a word for a or the,

46
00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:41.250
and it has a,

47
00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:44.690
but six cases might,
yeah.

48
00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:49.030
Nominative genitive date of gives it an Ableton live and Vocativ yes,

49
00:03:49.031 --> 00:03:49.864
six cases

50
00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:56.830
and they inflict nouns and adjectives and so forth for their meaning.

51
00:03:56.991 --> 00:03:57.824
They don't,

52
00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:02.450
it's much more structured and that sense in English is,

53
00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:05.450
so let's say

54
00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:11.090
a man should have a beer,

55
00:04:11.091 --> 00:04:13.130
this is not something a Roman would say,

56
00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:17.950
but perhaps a German or a carrot or a gall would get on Google translate to tell

57
00:04:17.951 --> 00:04:21.580
the Roman this.
Um,
well,
that's not correct.

58
00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:26.710
This says,
no,
no one should have,

59
00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:32.140
no one should be a bearded man.
You could translate that as,

60
00:04:32.141 --> 00:04:33.790
and um,

61
00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:39.090
that's pretty much the opposite of what I put in.

62
00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:44.070
It should be a,
if we're using the word Homo,
homo,

63
00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:49.200
Tibet barbata said,
that's close enough.

64
00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:52.320
That means a man should be bearded.
Um,

65
00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:58.910
well
let's say

66
00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:01.910
you,
Julius,

67
00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:08.290
Julius Caesar and veins,

68
00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:12.080
Raul,
uh,

69
00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:15.350
well it doesn't seem to recognize a verb invades.

70
00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:19.090
And for some reason it puts the nominative form,

71
00:05:19.091 --> 00:05:24.091
which is the subjects for Gall Inbetween Julius Caesar's name.

72
00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:26.150
<v 0>Okay.</v>

73
00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:31.150
<v 1>That is obviously an issue because it is not as male name and it offers no</v>

74
00:05:31.401 --> 00:05:35.440
accusative.
It should be Yuliya [inaudible].

75
00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:38.540
I don't know the word for invade.
I believe

76
00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:43.460
pet Tierra means attack.
So Uli is Kaiser.

77
00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:48.740
Golly,
I'm,
it should be something along those lines.

78
00:05:48.741 --> 00:05:53.030
So Google translate's not working out pretty well with the lab,

79
00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:56.150
but I want to do a final test.

80
00:05:56.151 --> 00:06:00.680
I want to put a sentence through multiple languages and Google translate and

81
00:06:00.681 --> 00:06:05.681
then translate it back to English to see how it survives through the filters are

82
00:06:06.141 --> 00:06:10.310
not the filters,
the other languages.
So let's,
let's see.
Um,

83
00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:16.570
let's say something like,
my name is Justin.

84
00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:22.360
I am recording a youtube

85
00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:28.630
video.
I asked,
cause the question,

86
00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:29.913
hello,

87
00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:37.950
does Google should be capitalized trends late

88
00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:42.250
work efficiently.

89
00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:48.030
So let's run this sentence through several languages and see how it comes back

90
00:06:48.031 --> 00:06:51.460
to us.
So starting with Latin.
Alright,

91
00:06:52.570 --> 00:06:57.570
Noah steel,
Latin two French,
two French,

92
00:06:57.900 --> 00:07:01.930
two
Korean,

93
00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:06.460
Korean to

94
00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:09.903
Danish.

95
00:07:12.070 --> 00:07:14.200
Danish to

96
00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:21.230
Punjabi,
20 Javi

97
00:07:23.410 --> 00:07:24.243
to

98
00:07:28.510 --> 00:07:29.343
check,

99
00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:36.320
check two,
two,

100
00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:40.660
two chihuahuas to

101
00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:43.480
Arabic.

102
00:07:48.250 --> 00:07:50.620
Arabic to

103
00:07:52.150 --> 00:07:56.440
do Japanese ship.
Why Shepherd?
Nikki?

104
00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:00.093
<v 0>Okay.</v>

105
00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:04.370
<v 1>Japanese.
The Chinese.</v>

106
00:08:04.980 --> 00:08:05.813
<v 0>Okay.</v>

107
00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:10.833
<v 1>Oh,
what?</v>

108
00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:15.920
Oh my bad Chinese too.

109
00:08:18.210 --> 00:08:22.660
Russian.
Russian too.

110
00:08:26.340 --> 00:08:27.630
Irish.

111
00:08:28.710 --> 00:08:33.710
Very Long Day and Irish back to English.

112
00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:45.500
And we end up with the sentence in the original sentence was,

113
00:08:45.501 --> 00:08:49.760
my name is Justin.
I'm recording youtube video.
I asked the question,

114
00:08:49.790 --> 00:08:52.460
does Google translate work efficiently?

115
00:08:52.461 --> 00:08:56.760
And we ended up after several languages reaching,
my name is Justin.

116
00:08:56.850 --> 00:09:00.000
I think I saw this letter.
Make sure that the expression,

117
00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:07.510
obviously running the sentence through several languages in Google translate is

118
00:09:07.511 --> 00:09:09.910
a nightmare.
And

119
00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:15.960
it's not very likely that someone will ever have the need to run it through

120
00:09:15.961 --> 00:09:19.620
several languages like that.
But if it ever,

121
00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:23.280
if a need ever arose,
it would not.
And well,

122
00:09:24.630 --> 00:09:29.630
so the conclusion is Google translate is a fairly efficient system,

123
00:09:32.930 --> 00:09:37.190
but it makes very simple grammatical errors.

124
00:09:38.330 --> 00:09:38.840
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

125
00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:43.010
<v 1>That often do not take the meaning of the sentence,</v>

126
00:09:43.011 --> 00:09:45.540
but it definitely can,
as we saw with what,

127
00:09:45.541 --> 00:09:48.140
and it can change the entire meeting of the symptoms,

128
00:09:48.141 --> 00:09:52.190
or you can end up with some nonsense such as this.

129
00:09:52.191 --> 00:09:56.570
So that's all I have for you today.
Um,
thank you for watching.
I would encourage,

130
00:09:56.571 --> 00:09:59.720
in fact,
to learn,
I know that language,

131
00:09:59.721 --> 00:10:04.640
rather than rely on technology,
no matter how advanced it becomes.

132
00:10:05.420 --> 00:10:06.120
<v 0>Okay.</v>

133
00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:08.400
<v 1>And,
uh,
that's all I have.
So thank you for watching.</v>
