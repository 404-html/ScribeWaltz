Hello and welcome the fire of learning the French,

2
00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:05.850
the surrender monkeys of Europe.

3
00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:10.170
The Nation only exists because the British and the Americans saved it so many

4
00:00:10.171 --> 00:00:13.500
times.
If you want to know what the French flag looks like,

5
00:00:13.501 --> 00:00:18.390
well here it is for sale.
French army rifle,
never fired,

6
00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.730
dropped once,
et Cetera,
et cetera.

7
00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.380
Every nation has its negative stereotypes and for France,

8
00:00:25.381 --> 00:00:28.140
one of the main ones is,
well,
you get the picture,

9
00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.940
but how deserving are the French actually have the name coward?

10
00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:38.150
Do they really have a poor military record or is this stereotype really just not

11
00:00:38.221 --> 00:00:40.170
very substantial?
In this video,

12
00:00:40.171 --> 00:00:44.070
we're going to take a look at the French military history and determine the

13
00:00:44.071 --> 00:00:47.790
authenticity of the insult.
So as you may know,

14
00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.740
the origin of associating France with cowardice and surrendering comes from the

15
00:00:52.741 --> 00:00:57.690
events of the Second World War.
On June 22nd,

16
00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.060
1940 the French government surrendered to the Nazi.

17
00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:04.260
Germans and Germany subsequently occupied the north of the country while the

18
00:01:04.261 --> 00:01:06.510
south was governed by a puppet government.

19
00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:10.350
Regardless of whatever conclusion we come to in this video,

20
00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.510
we can admit that this surrender was in fact embarrassing and to the allies at

21
00:01:15.511 --> 00:01:18.180
the time.
Demoralizing.
However,

22
00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.830
why was this particular surrenders so well known and embarrassing?

23
00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.760
Was it because the French were expected to a performed better?

24
00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:29.250
France is a very old country.

25
00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.260
There is debate as to when exactly the nation itself arose,

26
00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.950
but the foundations of the nation begin as early as four 81 eight d under

27
00:01:37.951 --> 00:01:40.290
Clovis,
the first king of the Franks.

28
00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.910
This makes friends essentially the oldest,
major nation and Europe.

29
00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:50.310
Secondly,
France is the third largest nation in Europe after Russia and Ukraine.

30
00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:55.410
The simple fact that France has endured for so long and held onto so much

31
00:01:55.411 --> 00:01:58.020
territory,
hotly contested territory,

32
00:01:58.021 --> 00:02:02.370
mind you suggest that they are a people with a backbone.
However,

33
00:02:02.371 --> 00:02:06.630
what did the actual statistics say in the words of the British historian,

34
00:02:06.631 --> 00:02:07.680
Niall Ferguson.

35
00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:13.190
Frances participated in 50 of the 125 major European wars fought since 1495 more

36
00:02:15.751 --> 00:02:19.740
than Austria at 47 and England at 43 as an example,

37
00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:24.450
in 168 battles fought since 387 BC.

38
00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:28.080
He's a including the Gauls as French.
I'm not sure if that's really fair,

39
00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:28.890
but anyway,

40
00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:33.630
to continue here and the 168 battle spots since 387 BC,

41
00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:38.900
the French have one 109 drawn 10 and lost 49 and this is of course,

42
00:02:39.751 --> 00:02:40.680
major battles.

43
00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:45.860
This makes France the most successful military power in European history in

44
00:02:46.111 --> 00:02:48.570
terms of number of battles fought and won.

45
00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:53.550
Many of these wars were some of the most important in European and in fact world

46
00:02:53.551 --> 00:02:57.480
history in seven 32 for example,
at the battle of tour,

47
00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:00.790
the French King Charles Martel,
the Umayyad Caliphate,

48
00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:05.830
the saving Christian Europe from a Muslim invasion in 10 66 the Normans,

49
00:03:05.831 --> 00:03:10.240
a group then consisting of a mix of French and vikings conquered England and

50
00:03:10.241 --> 00:03:12.910
laid the foundations for the modern English nation.

51
00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:17.440
The French were some of the main participants of the Crusades and a major power

52
00:03:17.441 --> 00:03:18.670
throughout the middle ages.

53
00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:22.600
The French colonial empire would extend across large parts of the world,

54
00:03:22.601 --> 00:03:26.020
including much of North America,
Africa,
parts of the Middle East,

55
00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:27.820
India and East Asia,

56
00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:32.080
and the 17th seventies the American revolution was greatly dependent on French

57
00:03:32.081 --> 00:03:33.310
intervention.
In fact,

58
00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:37.960
French intervention may have been the deciding factor of the war under Napoleon.

59
00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:40.990
The French empire would extend from Spain to Russia.

60
00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:44.710
The French were a major player in the conflicts of the 19th century,

61
00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:47.680
and we're a main cause for victory in the first world war.

62
00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:52.510
This is just a brief overview of some of Francis major military successes.

63
00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:57.100
There have of course been many major defeats as well.
The victorious.

64
00:03:57.101 --> 00:03:59.320
Eventually in the hundred years war over England,

65
00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:04.470
the war or wars really strained France greatly and it was often on the losing

66
00:04:04.871 --> 00:04:07.690
side.
The French and Indian war was a disaster.

67
00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:11.140
Napoleon's empire eventually fell apart.
World War II,
as I said,

68
00:04:11.141 --> 00:04:14.200
did not go so well,
et cetera.
However,

69
00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:16.720
from the Middle Ages to the modern day,

70
00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:20.830
the French army was one of the best equipped in all of Europe,
and in fact,

71
00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:23.980
oftentimes in the world and many ways as well.

72
00:04:23.981 --> 00:04:28.090
They laid the foundation for the Organization of the modern military and
general.

73
00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:33.010
Many of the words used in modern warfare derived from French vocabulary such as

74
00:04:33.011 --> 00:04:36.790
army artillery,
Captain Cavalry charge as espionage,

75
00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:41.170
General Lieutenant Lance Marines,
maneuver,
military,
mine,

76
00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:45.550
naval parachute,
pilot platoon,
regimented soldier and trench.

77
00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:48.340
And so what's the case with World War II?
Well,

78
00:04:48.341 --> 00:04:52.420
France was not the only nation to surrender to the Germans and of the nations,

79
00:04:52.421 --> 00:04:55.570
which did surrender friends house as one of the longest.

80
00:04:55.571 --> 00:05:00.190
Among them though the German military strength at the time and blitzkrieg tactic

81
00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:05.320
claimed many nations.
Poland for example,
surrendered.
And a little over a month,

82
00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:07.390
Belgium fell in 18 days.

83
00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:11.680
The Netherlands fell in four days for the more following the surrender of the

84
00:05:11.681 --> 00:05:12.520
French people,

85
00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:17.200
even if not the government held out against the Nazis through the French

86
00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:20.050
Resistance.
And so in conclusion,
from this short video,

87
00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:24.340
the image of the French as cowardly is definitely not deserved.

88
00:05:24.341 --> 00:05:25.810
And as a matter of fact,

89
00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:29.830
the French have had one of the finest militaries to exist in all of history.

90
00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:32.500
