00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:03.570
As we get older,
we're introduced to larger and larger numbers.

2
00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:04.620
The first unaccounted,

3
00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:09.680
10 then 20 then maybe a hundred then we learn about a thousand and thousands and

4
00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:11.820
a million and a billion and a trillion,

5
00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:14.280
but it kind of stops there for most people.

6
00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:16.680
I mean the number line certainly doesn't stop there,

7
00:00:16.681 --> 00:00:19.020
but we don't really use numbers higher than a Trulia and all that.

8
00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:23.700
Often at a personal level anyway,
as our civilization has grown,

9
00:00:23.701 --> 00:00:26.880
we've had need of higher numbers in a trillion to contemplate or universe.

10
00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:32.100
So maybe you wondered what comes after a trillion will the answer to that

11
00:00:32.101 --> 00:00:36.180
question,
believe it or not,
as a trillion in one pass,
999 trillion,

12
00:00:36.181 --> 00:00:37.380
999 billion,

13
00:00:37.381 --> 00:00:42.381
999,999,999 we reached one quadrillion with five groups of Zeros and four groups

14
00:00:45.991 --> 00:00:47.400
of zero is more than a thousand.

15
00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:52.500
Just like a quadrilateral has four sides add three more zeros and we get a

16
00:00:52.501 --> 00:00:54.780
quintillion than a sex Tilian.

17
00:00:54.781 --> 00:00:59.781
Then a septillion than octillion than non alien in a one followed by 33 Zeros

18
00:01:01.581 --> 00:01:05.580
and the deck Elian.
They sound like difficult names.

19
00:01:05.581 --> 00:01:07.810
It really all it takes is the ability to count.

20
00:01:07.811 --> 00:01:12.811
And Len Len has a unique and beautiful ability to make simple things seem very

21
00:01:12.941 --> 00:01:15.040
complicated.
For example,

22
00:01:15.041 --> 00:01:20.041
in Septillion Septum means just seven in Latin in septillion has seven more sets

23
00:01:20.951 --> 00:01:23.890
of Zeros and a thousand in Quinta Kilian,

24
00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:27.910
which has 15 more sets of Zeros in 1000 Quinn deck,

25
00:01:27.911 --> 00:01:32.860
I'm just means 15 to put these numbers to use the Milky Way galaxy is about a

26
00:01:32.861 --> 00:01:37.300
quintillion kilometers long.
That's 600 quadrillion miles.

27
00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:41.950
There were about one octillion Adams and the average human body,

28
00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:43.840
10 billion years,

29
00:01:43.841 --> 00:01:48.841
it's 315 quadrillion seconds long and the earth weighs about six septillion

30
00:01:49.511 --> 00:01:52.510
kilograms.
That's 13 octillion pounds.

31
00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:56.530
Although the Latin numbers don't write with us through all of our numbers and

32
00:01:56.531 --> 00:02:00.820
our adventure and the number line,
what would be 10 duo trigon trillion,

33
00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:05.080
a thousand followed by 96 zeros is just called it Google.

34
00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:10.390
So what's the biggest number called?
Well,
that's an impossible question.

35
00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:14.140
Take any of them where you can think of and you can add one to it.

36
00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:19.570
Mathematicians call this concept of endlessness on the number line,
infinity,

37
00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:25.120
which is also a Latin word from infinitum for videos or mathematics,

38
00:02:25.121 --> 00:02:28.300
science,
and much more.
