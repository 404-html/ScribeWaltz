00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:01.800
Hello and welcome to fire of learning.

2
00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:05.070
This is the fourth and final Myra is very cyber analysis video.

3
00:00:05.071 --> 00:00:07.800
In this video we're going to be talking about the least common category of the

4
00:00:07.801 --> 00:00:11.460
nts,
the intuitive thinkers,
the ENTP,
the INTP,

5
00:00:11.461 --> 00:00:15.090
the I and t j and the Ian Tj.
Now just like to Ns,

6
00:00:15.091 --> 00:00:19.260
we talk about in the last video and tps and Auntie J's May on the surface look

7
00:00:19.261 --> 00:00:20.011
fairly similar,

8
00:00:20.011 --> 00:00:23.460
but deep down the circuitry is fairly different and while they may share a

9
00:00:23.461 --> 00:00:26.520
considerable amount of similarities,
they may be fairly different.

10
00:00:26.521 --> 00:00:29.910
People will elaborate on the differences when we get into the cognitive

11
00:00:29.911 --> 00:00:31.890
functions and just a couple of minutes here,
but for now,

12
00:00:31.891 --> 00:00:36.150
what basic similarities do these types share that allow them to be categories in

13
00:00:36.151 --> 00:00:37.680
the same category?
Well,

14
00:00:37.681 --> 00:00:41.540
like all n nts are highly attracted to abstract concepts,

15
00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:45.000
new possibilities and bake ideas.
They think outside the box very well.

16
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.930
They may have complex personalities and they trust their gut feeling over what

17
00:00:48.931 --> 00:00:51.900
their immediate senses are telling them and they're particularly good at reading

18
00:00:51.901 --> 00:00:55.920
between the lines of things when confronted with new information and an NT will

19
00:00:55.921 --> 00:00:59.550
attempt to formulate the big picture first and then work out the components as

20
00:00:59.551 --> 00:01:03.300
opposed to as to do the opposite and like all tease nts,

21
00:01:03.301 --> 00:01:06.900
have a preference for making decisions based on objective criteria and their own

22
00:01:06.901 --> 00:01:07.830
logical conclusions.

23
00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.400
And we'll seek to exhibit this decision making style accordingly,

24
00:01:11.401 --> 00:01:14.760
particularly in situations which I think you function of trucks and sue such as

25
00:01:14.761 --> 00:01:19.090
the organization of the external world or the search for precision and truth and

26
00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:21.270
are usually bright,
rational level headed,

27
00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:25.030
independent and enthusiastic people having an interest in and in fact may in

28
00:01:25.031 --> 00:01:28.410
hobbies out of subjects which they're fascinated in,
such as science,
math,

29
00:01:28.411 --> 00:01:29.850
history,
philosophy,
et Cetera,

30
00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.270
may make them appear somewhat geeky or nerdy on the surface,

31
00:01:33.271 --> 00:01:36.300
especially as an a favorite participation in the subjects that were social

32
00:01:36.301 --> 00:01:38.490
interaction.
At times,
even an extrovert's,

33
00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:42.390
though they namely introverts may appear awkward or isolated at times.

34
00:01:42.391 --> 00:01:45.990
They do tend to value human relationships though because of their weaker feeling

35
00:01:45.991 --> 00:01:48.900
functions not always expressed very well.
However,

36
00:01:48.901 --> 00:01:52.380
when it is expressed and t's May displayed and being gregarious with people that

37
00:01:52.381 --> 00:01:56.130
are like being open to discussing a wide variety of subjects.
As mentioned,

38
00:01:56.131 --> 00:01:58.260
nts have a preference for making decisions,

39
00:01:58.261 --> 00:02:01.320
understanding concepts and living other lives in accordance with what makes

40
00:02:01.321 --> 00:02:01.891
sense to them,

41
00:02:01.891 --> 00:02:05.010
and it may tend to view emotions as something which gets in the way of this,

42
00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:08.400
especially their own.
Accordingly,
if they can be shown that they are wrong,

43
00:02:08.401 --> 00:02:10.560
they will often attempt to not take it personally.
However,

44
00:02:10.561 --> 00:02:13.440
if they believe that a lot of conclusions are being criticized or challenge,

45
00:02:13.441 --> 00:02:16.710
especially unnecessarily,
not only will they be quick to debate,

46
00:02:16.711 --> 00:02:19.950
but they will often be very challenging debaters viewing it as an opportunity to

47
00:02:19.951 --> 00:02:21.600
test and refine their own beliefs,

48
00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:24.870
utilize their problem solving skills and accordingly often enjoy the process

49
00:02:24.871 --> 00:02:27.420
that's based so long as it does not lead to bitter argument.

50
00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:30.000
This is not to say that they are unpleasant people.
However,

51
00:02:30.001 --> 00:02:32.420
aunties are usually laid back,
flexible,
unlikable,

52
00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:35.070
and environments in which they're not stressed.
Then it'd be witty,

53
00:02:35.071 --> 00:02:37.950
comical or attempt to be entertaining.
Sometimes it's entertaining.

54
00:02:37.951 --> 00:02:42.030
Side isn't as funny to other types as it often involves pranks or humor,

55
00:02:42.031 --> 00:02:45.510
which is intentionally confusing.
However,
in being a very independent type,

56
00:02:45.511 --> 00:02:47.370
they are generally proud of their own originality,

57
00:02:47.371 --> 00:02:48.970
very concerned about their free time,

58
00:02:48.971 --> 00:02:52.740
maybe be very private and and welcoming of orders or manipulation and may react

59
00:02:52.741 --> 00:02:57.150
to a fronts not only by argumentation but by leaving a situation entirely.

60
00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:00.100
Like why is there a generally more respectful people's independence?

61
00:03:00.101 --> 00:03:04.210
More so ntps in Ntj is honestly,
but we'll discuss that in a moment.
However,

62
00:03:04.211 --> 00:03:05.140
on the negative side,

63
00:03:05.141 --> 00:03:09.070
when stressed or unhealthy and t's may become argumentative,
cold,
defensive,

64
00:03:09.071 --> 00:03:11.830
isolated,
caustic and irritable at times,

65
00:03:11.831 --> 00:03:14.500
if their reasoning makes sense in their own heads and they'd be unwelcoming of

66
00:03:14.501 --> 00:03:18.100
criticism or challenge or set of decisions and may try to ignore emotions and

67
00:03:18.101 --> 00:03:20.050
their decision making process including their own,

68
00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:22.970
when other's emotions are concerned that it may take great offense to this Nigga

69
00:03:22.971 --> 00:03:23.980
Black Tan for them more.

70
00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:26.680
When there are misunderstandings between NT and another person,

71
00:03:26.681 --> 00:03:29.290
they may expect the other person to come to bridge that gap.

72
00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:32.950
They may also be considerably suspicious of others and antisocial,

73
00:03:32.951 --> 00:03:36.310
which may offend strangers and discourage people close to them considering their

74
00:03:36.311 --> 00:03:37.001
own emotions.

75
00:03:37.001 --> 00:03:40.150
Neglecting them can lead to stress and when a problem cannot be solved by what

76
00:03:40.151 --> 00:03:42.460
normally makes sense to them,
then they shut down entirely.

77
00:03:42.461 --> 00:03:45.910
Where other types would collect themselves like all intuitive types and they

78
00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:49.600
have difficulty focusing on practical tasks such as house or car maintenance or

79
00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:51.190
finances.
Antibodies,

80
00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:54.880
especially while spending considerable amounts of times in their own heads and

81
00:03:54.881 --> 00:03:55.810
may have its benefits,

82
00:03:55.811 --> 00:03:59.530
it may be very stressful for them as these tasks go undone and life outside

83
00:03:59.531 --> 00:04:01.060
passes by.
Furthermore,

84
00:04:01.061 --> 00:04:04.030
while they may indeed be very original and fairly bright or they're thinking

85
00:04:04.031 --> 00:04:08.290
habits and choices may make them appear to others to be egotistical or arrogant

86
00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:11.830
or worse can lead to actual egoism and arrogance.

87
00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:15.460
Assuming that people who think differently or our overall different are simply

88
00:04:15.461 --> 00:04:17.640
not intelligent or worthwhile.
However,

89
00:04:17.641 --> 00:04:19.860
most entities and not exhibit these traits commonly,

90
00:04:19.861 --> 00:04:23.850
especially in extreme and as mentioned,
are generally easy going and likable.

91
00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:25.860
There are systematic abstract thinking,
style,

92
00:04:25.861 --> 00:04:29.520
desire for achievement and originality and wide ranger interest.
Often wines,

93
00:04:29.521 --> 00:04:33.510
pumping fields at the sciences,
philosophy,
politics and economics,
engineering,

94
00:04:33.511 --> 00:04:37.500
et Cetera,
and many notable figures within these fields we will see have been nts

95
00:04:37.501 --> 00:04:41.160
throughout history.
So that's a sufficient introductory description.
However,

96
00:04:41.161 --> 00:04:41.831
to continue,

97
00:04:41.831 --> 00:04:45.120
we have to establish the differences between the Auntie J's and the NTPS.

98
00:04:45.121 --> 00:04:46.680
And to do that,
we will of course,

99
00:04:46.681 --> 00:04:49.690
house of look at the cognitive functions and like the Nfj isn't nfps.

100
00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:51.000
In the last video,
like I said,

101
00:04:51.001 --> 00:04:54.120
Auntie J's and NTPS did not share any cognitive functions.

102
00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:58.950
So here are the four types.
Again,
the IMTJ,
the Emtj,
the INTP,

103
00:04:58.951 --> 00:05:02.130
and the MTP,
and here are their cognitive functions.

104
00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:05.730
So they're all entities because they're lead functions of both intuition and

105
00:05:05.731 --> 00:05:09.460
thinking.
However,
as you can see here,
they're opposite focuses and tjs,

106
00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:13.200
but for extroverted thinking and introverted intuition and ntps prefer intuit is

107
00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:15.530
taking an extrovert intuition.
Likewise,

108
00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:19.410
they're inferior functions as well are opposites and tjs are introverted.

109
00:05:19.411 --> 00:05:23.220
Feelers and extroverted sensor is an ntps are introverted sensors and

110
00:05:23.221 --> 00:05:24.330
extroverted feelers.

111
00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:28.530
So on the surface these two types may act very similarly and may have similar

112
00:05:28.531 --> 00:05:29.880
interests and hobbies,
et cetera.

113
00:05:29.881 --> 00:05:33.150
But deep down they're circuitry is a little bit different.
What's the difference?

114
00:05:33.151 --> 00:05:34.170
Well,
let's get into it.

115
00:05:34.171 --> 00:05:39.171
Starting with intuition and Tj is prefer Ellis said Ann I introverted intuition

116
00:05:39.511 --> 00:05:43.680
and ntps prefer extroverted intuition and he now we explained the same

117
00:05:43.681 --> 00:05:46.050
difference in the Nfj is an nfps in the last video,

118
00:05:46.051 --> 00:05:49.140
but we'll do it again here because the intuition and combination with the

119
00:05:49.141 --> 00:05:52.290
thinking function,
which these types of for comes out a little bit differently.

120
00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:56.970
False intuition functions are of course functions.
Folks focused on ideas,

121
00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:58.250
concepts and possibilities,

122
00:05:58.251 --> 00:06:01.730
but anti functions more on connecting concepts that fit a larger point,

123
00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:05.510
a connects ideas as branches into a single tree,
I suppose you could say.

124
00:06:05.511 --> 00:06:09.710
Whereas an he is more like a focus on a wide variety of ideas and concepts both

125
00:06:09.711 --> 00:06:11.090
to create and understand.

126
00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:16.100
So auntie J's are going to spend a lot of time trying to tie together what they

127
00:06:16.101 --> 00:06:17.990
perceive to be true in their heads.

128
00:06:17.991 --> 00:06:20.600
And while generally plays quite a bit of focus on the subject which they're

129
00:06:20.601 --> 00:06:21.410
interested in.

130
00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:24.680
They may just intuitively understand things and see patterns and things which

131
00:06:24.681 --> 00:06:25.850
may go unnoticed to others.

132
00:06:25.851 --> 00:06:29.690
It may have moments where it's described as sort of Eureka type moment where

133
00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:33.350
things finally come together and understand things and you can almost see it in

134
00:06:33.351 --> 00:06:36.270
their eyes when they piece something together like that and while anti explores

135
00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:38.210
a variety of concepts,
generally this focus,

136
00:06:38.211 --> 00:06:42.020
we'll leave them somewhat less interested in unrelated concepts and it may be in

137
00:06:42.021 --> 00:06:44.360
fact somewhat critical of useless information.

138
00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:48.410
This is what leads Ntj is to be fairly independent thinkers because they may be

139
00:06:48.411 --> 00:06:52.100
equally critical of authority backed information such as schoolwork,

140
00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:56.330
which other types of more responsive to and teas in general as a matter of fact

141
00:06:56.331 --> 00:06:59.850
are classic examples of the old,
the teacher says I'm smart,

142
00:06:59.851 --> 00:07:03.770
but lazy type kids and generally teachers actually do meanness with Aunties,

143
00:07:03.771 --> 00:07:08.771
but with reference to Ntg A's and Tj is usually can function fairly well in a

144
00:07:08.901 --> 00:07:10.670
very regimented and systematic and environment.

145
00:07:10.671 --> 00:07:14.330
They just don't want to do that with school because they'd see it as outside of

146
00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:17.780
their,
um,
their goals for their life and their style of thinking.

147
00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:21.320
This function compliments we're thinking function,
extroverted thinking tee,

148
00:07:21.350 --> 00:07:25.550
which Emtj is lead with an I and t J's follow with very well tee is a function

149
00:07:25.551 --> 00:07:28.790
of focused on an efficient and logical organization of the external world.

150
00:07:28.850 --> 00:07:33.050
NTPS which we'll discuss here in a moment with their ta in any may spend copious

151
00:07:33.051 --> 00:07:35.090
amounts of time contemplating subjects more in depth,

152
00:07:35.091 --> 00:07:39.290
but tea is more focused on utilizing information and making it applicable to

153
00:07:39.291 --> 00:07:41.150
real world settings.
Then as I said,

154
00:07:41.180 --> 00:07:44.630
they're an eye function is going to be consistently reviewing information and

155
00:07:44.631 --> 00:07:48.740
enticing them to explore hunches and filtering out unnecessary ideas.
In such,

156
00:07:48.770 --> 00:07:52.790
this accordingly draws into sciences and philosophy and politics and such
things.

157
00:07:52.791 --> 00:07:55.700
A great number of contributors to these fields are and tjs as they're

158
00:07:55.701 --> 00:07:59.120
exceptionally skilled with putting things together and making them work in the

159
00:07:59.121 --> 00:08:02.660
real world with abstract topics especially,
but also of course in business,

160
00:08:02.661 --> 00:08:05.960
the military or other organizations even in the household and with friends and

161
00:08:05.961 --> 00:08:09.530
such,
they're good with graphs,
charts and means of organizing data like that.

162
00:08:09.531 --> 00:08:12.440
They're more concerned with being effective than precise and even though they

163
00:08:12.441 --> 00:08:16.890
may themselves be very independent and would prefer that others be independent,

164
00:08:16.910 --> 00:08:19.160
they generally do well in positions of command.

165
00:08:19.310 --> 00:08:22.730
This is why Auntie J's do so well on some of the high stress and not mentally

166
00:08:22.731 --> 00:08:23.690
challenging environment.

167
00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:27.170
If you're looking at CE and Tj is in particular have the highest average income

168
00:08:27.171 --> 00:08:30.380
in the US and a great number of not only modern CEOs and such,

169
00:08:30.381 --> 00:08:34.100
but in fact famous military leaders throughout history and Napoleon,

170
00:08:34.130 --> 00:08:35.600
Cesar Alexander,
Gingiss,

171
00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:39.230
et Cetera were ENT js and this is evident employing tee.

172
00:08:39.231 --> 00:08:41.990
These four were all men who got right into the thick of battle and maintain a

173
00:08:41.991 --> 00:08:45.080
cool head and we're quickly capable of figuring out what needed to be done.

174
00:08:45.081 --> 00:08:46.610
The win and executing that plan,

175
00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:49.580
whether actual combat or on the political scene or something like that.

176
00:08:49.670 --> 00:08:50.660
Looking at an eye.

177
00:08:50.661 --> 00:08:53.360
Each of these leaders were independent thinkers with grand designs.

178
00:08:53.420 --> 00:08:55.380
This is again evidence on the battlefield.

179
00:08:55.381 --> 00:08:58.740
Each of these men had tactics which were unique or revolutionary for the times

180
00:08:58.741 --> 00:09:01.770
in fact,
but also in the design of their empires.

181
00:09:01.890 --> 00:09:05.370
They weren't just going to sit back and be the dutiful Sga general who just does

182
00:09:05.371 --> 00:09:08.340
what it needs to be done.
It goes through with their service.
No,
they were,

183
00:09:08.580 --> 00:09:11.980
they took over their governments,
you know,
their nation's conquered major empire,

184
00:09:12.030 --> 00:09:13.110
et cetera.
Things like that.

185
00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:15.720
I and t J's are definitely noticeable on the seniors as well,

186
00:09:15.721 --> 00:09:19.110
even if they're not so bold as they're extroverted counterparts at times in

187
00:09:19.111 --> 00:09:22.680
terms of the country like Vladimir Lenin or in terms of a major company or

188
00:09:22.681 --> 00:09:25.960
something like Elan Musk.
Elon Musk is another good example.
He's like,

189
00:09:25.961 --> 00:09:30.450
leave less interested in studying the intricacies of human civilization and and

190
00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:34.140
its effects on the world pass what is necessary and more interested in building

191
00:09:34.141 --> 00:09:36.630
things which will have an impact on remodeling the world.

192
00:09:36.631 --> 00:09:40.640
And directing his subordinates to follow through any and NTPS.
However,

193
00:09:40.641 --> 00:09:44.070
it's more concerned as I studied with a variety of ideas and new possibilities.

194
00:09:44.190 --> 00:09:48.030
Extroverted intuitors like ntps are constantly on the lookout for new ideas and

195
00:09:48.031 --> 00:09:51.180
it become very interested in new concepts and naturally they're very good at

196
00:09:51.181 --> 00:09:53.490
comprehending them quickly and in fact improving on them.

197
00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:56.850
This focus on new intriguing concepts can make them seem like they jump from

198
00:09:56.851 --> 00:09:59.040
topic to topic and this is certainly somewhat true.

199
00:09:59.041 --> 00:10:03.300
We're an NTJ may focus on one thing like economics or the military or something

200
00:10:03.301 --> 00:10:07.020
like that.
For an extent of time.
It might be astronomy one week,

201
00:10:07.050 --> 00:10:09.990
maybe even for a couple of days and history for a bit and another language.

202
00:10:09.991 --> 00:10:13.050
Probably Juggling a whole bunch of concepts at once and then coming back to them

203
00:10:13.051 --> 00:10:17.400
at different times.
For an NTP,
it's not that they have a short attention span,

204
00:10:17.401 --> 00:10:20.400
they're just comfortable juggling multiple subjects at once and in fact they

205
00:10:20.401 --> 00:10:22.230
tend to prefer that accordingly.

206
00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:25.600
Antibodies can be somewhat bothered by routine or unstimulating monotony.

207
00:10:25.601 --> 00:10:26.640
You're practical tasks.

208
00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:30.090
They may not only be capable or even above average skill at doing something like

209
00:10:30.091 --> 00:10:30.780
their math homework,

210
00:10:30.780 --> 00:10:34.100
but maybe putting a bunch of numbers through systems isn't as interesting as to

211
00:10:34.101 --> 00:10:35.580
what they have decided to do with our time.

212
00:10:35.640 --> 00:10:40.180
And that's not necessarily always that they have a preference for doing some

213
00:10:40.181 --> 00:10:40.530
glory,

214
00:10:40.530 --> 00:10:44.990
a big picture contemplation over the menial task and tribulations of the average

215
00:10:44.991 --> 00:10:45.301
of life.

216
00:10:45.301 --> 00:10:48.570
It's admittedly sometimes that they're just more interested in a video game over

217
00:10:48.571 --> 00:10:52.350
housework,
but obviously who hasn't found themselves in that situation before,

218
00:10:52.351 --> 00:10:55.860
but ntps especially may have to learn how to come back down to earth a little

219
00:10:55.861 --> 00:10:57.690
bit more than they'd like to.
And of course,

220
00:10:57.691 --> 00:11:01.740
NTP is preferred CEI introverted thinking Tiaa as concerned with systematizing

221
00:11:01.741 --> 00:11:04.740
the world logically and impartially and consistently refining itself in order to

222
00:11:04.741 --> 00:11:07.230
perfect the understanding of the world accordingly.

223
00:11:07.231 --> 00:11:11.280
Tio leads like antibodies are very interested in systems and are very quick to

224
00:11:11.281 --> 00:11:14.880
contemplate the components of something and decipher is core or solve an issue.

225
00:11:15.190 --> 00:11:18.780
The Ai leads are also very precise and seek to convey ideas without confusion.

226
00:11:19.170 --> 00:11:21.660
Stps generally,
we'll do this by being more laconic,

227
00:11:21.661 --> 00:11:22.800
as I said in a previous video,

228
00:11:22.801 --> 00:11:26.400
but ntps are not afraid to use a large vocabulary and we'll generally have

229
00:11:26.401 --> 00:11:29.550
little patience for people who believe their vocabulary usage is used to

230
00:11:29.551 --> 00:11:31.740
unnecessary fluff statement.
Furthermore,

231
00:11:31.741 --> 00:11:34.620
ntps we'll have little patients or care for people who don't understand their

232
00:11:34.621 --> 00:11:36.930
interest or flat out ignore their reasoning.
In general,

233
00:11:37.250 --> 00:11:38.610
and t J's are like this as well,

234
00:11:38.611 --> 00:11:42.420
but ntps usually communicate things by pulling from RTI framework and if it's a

235
00:11:42.421 --> 00:11:45.270
complex matter,
the NTP may not express it very well,

236
00:11:45.271 --> 00:11:48.150
even though it makes perfect sense to them in their heads and may simply choose

237
00:11:48.151 --> 00:11:51.240
to forego explain the reasoning if they feel that others will not respect that

238
00:11:51.241 --> 00:11:54.100
anyway,
which is something that MTPs have to work on.

239
00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:57.520
Tia is essentially what makes ntps aspire it to be though are certainly not

240
00:11:57.521 --> 00:11:58.880
always successful at beings.

241
00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:01.960
US foc type character making decisions based on logic,

242
00:12:01.961 --> 00:12:05.740
contemplating various concepts,
disregarding of irrelevant emotions,
et cetera.

243
00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:07.300
Combined with intuition.

244
00:12:07.301 --> 00:12:11.470
NTPS generally have a preference for exploring various and treating concepts and

245
00:12:11.471 --> 00:12:15.490
ideas as opposed to their STP counterparts who prefer to explore the systems of

246
00:12:15.491 --> 00:12:17.080
the practical world accordingly.

247
00:12:17.080 --> 00:12:19.990
And Antiope we'll spend a lot of time in his or her head as their minds are

248
00:12:19.991 --> 00:12:23.980
constantly generating ideas and t I leads and review them and we'll lead them to

249
00:12:23.981 --> 00:12:27.430
hold internal debates about their logical consistency and likelihood and things

250
00:12:27.431 --> 00:12:30.880
such as that.
An INTP,
especially maybe one of the most introverted people,

251
00:12:30.881 --> 00:12:33.220
you know,
because it's been a lot of time in their heads on.

252
00:12:33.221 --> 00:12:36.910
Although all intuitive types can sometimes feel like the real world is

253
00:12:36.911 --> 00:12:38.020
interrupting their inner world,

254
00:12:38.230 --> 00:12:41.590
Ntps may have the greatest preference for living in their internal world because

255
00:12:41.591 --> 00:12:43.510
of these functions.
However,
as a result of this,

256
00:12:43.511 --> 00:12:46.390
then we'd be satisfied with an idea making sense in their heads once all of its

257
00:12:46.391 --> 00:12:50.530
aspects have been understood and not necessarily as focused as reproducing it in

258
00:12:50.531 --> 00:12:52.330
the real world as an Ndj might be.

259
00:12:52.390 --> 00:12:56.200
A perfect example of an NTP is Leonardo Da Vinci and ENTP.

260
00:12:56.200 --> 00:13:00.760
So therefore of course and and elite key in any lead was immensely interested in

261
00:13:00.761 --> 00:13:04.780
new ideas and concepts and field notebook upon notebook with a zone in the 15th

262
00:13:04.781 --> 00:13:08.920
century.
A little over 500 years ago,
he created flying machines,
submarines,
tanks,

263
00:13:08.921 --> 00:13:11.140
discovered heart disease,
et cetera.
He was a busy,

264
00:13:11.141 --> 00:13:16.060
creative and logical dude though not many NTP share Da Vinci's Iq estimated to

265
00:13:16.061 --> 00:13:20.110
be over 200 this ability to comprehend subjects and uncover that are internal

266
00:13:20.120 --> 00:13:23.440
meetings,
think to why the NTP types had the highest Iq average.

267
00:13:23.500 --> 00:13:26.800
However many of his inventions were never actually constructed Parsa because of

268
00:13:26.801 --> 00:13:29.860
some unfortunate incidents in his life but also partially because it was

269
00:13:29.861 --> 00:13:32.020
sufficient to him to know it would work.

270
00:13:32.140 --> 00:13:36.340
Another example of the difference between an Ntj an NTP is Tesla and Einstein,

271
00:13:36.760 --> 00:13:40.660
Tesla and I and Tj was interested in building things and inventing things and

272
00:13:40.990 --> 00:13:42.670
restructuring the external world.

273
00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.820
Einstein figured out a lot of things which are sitting of her phone but are more

274
00:13:45.821 --> 00:13:49.690
abstract and involves contemplation and restructured the external world on a

275
00:13:49.691 --> 00:13:54.691
more intellectual level and now the inferior functions and Tj is prefer

276
00:13:55.001 --> 00:13:59.500
introverted feeling.
FII and ntps prefer extroverted feeling.
Effie,
if I,

277
00:13:59.501 --> 00:14:02.860
as we have discussed as a function dedicated towards systematizing a set of

278
00:14:02.861 --> 00:14:06.100
principles or values which the person feel that they must connect to in order to

279
00:14:06.101 --> 00:14:09.220
feel truly like themselves.
Accordingly though it isn't a dominant trait,

280
00:14:09.221 --> 00:14:13.030
NTJ is may at times make decisions and reinforce their reasoning with morals and

281
00:14:13.031 --> 00:14:16.330
values and we'll have somewhat better understanding of their motion and focus on

282
00:14:16.331 --> 00:14:18.630
what is right when they feel that they are right.
If I is,

283
00:14:18.631 --> 00:14:21.760
because then it'd be very adamant about it and can make them seem stubborn.

284
00:14:21.970 --> 00:14:26.440
However,
their ability to use fis of course not as developed as their NFP or SFP

285
00:14:26.441 --> 00:14:30.730
counterparts and as the week of function and t J's May feel at times that they

286
00:14:30.731 --> 00:14:32.310
don't know who they are deep down and make them,

287
00:14:32.311 --> 00:14:34.180
it's some of their time trying to figure it out.

288
00:14:34.450 --> 00:14:39.310
NTPS for for Effie extroverted feeling if he is what stops ntps from being as

289
00:14:39.311 --> 00:14:40.390
harsh about their reasoning.

290
00:14:40.391 --> 00:14:44.230
As auntie J's though it may make them seem as somewhat awkward or socially

291
00:14:44.231 --> 00:14:46.510
anxious like I'll extrovert of feeders.

292
00:14:46.511 --> 00:14:49.690
NTPS have a concern for how other people feel and how others feel.

293
00:14:49.691 --> 00:14:51.470
Major directly impact their own emotions,

294
00:14:51.471 --> 00:14:54.530
but may feel awkward and trying to accommodate other's feelings because of the

295
00:14:54.531 --> 00:14:56.540
weakness of the function.
Lock in the natural,

296
00:14:56.541 --> 00:15:00.320
know how that they're Nfj an SFJ counterparts have though group harmony is

297
00:15:00.321 --> 00:15:01.011
important to them.

298
00:15:01.011 --> 00:15:03.920
It's a feeling of others gives in the way of their law to her conclusions.

299
00:15:03.921 --> 00:15:07.340
They will generally prefer their own reasoning to group emotion and harmony.

300
00:15:07.610 --> 00:15:10.570
And as they're feeling is a weaker function and is extroverted.

301
00:15:10.580 --> 00:15:13.520
They may have more difficulty dealing with their own emotions and may display

302
00:15:13.521 --> 00:15:17.420
them seemingly awkwardly or an appropriately,
especially while under stress.

303
00:15:17.450 --> 00:15:17.811
However,

304
00:15:17.811 --> 00:15:20.660
they will display it healthfully while conversing with friends or at times and

305
00:15:20.661 --> 00:15:24.020
expressing and emotional connection to the outer world and their place within it

306
00:15:24.021 --> 00:15:26.840
through poetry or similar thing.
And last but not least,

307
00:15:26.841 --> 00:15:31.841
ntps prefer as I introverted sensing and Auntie J's for as he extroverted

308
00:15:32.001 --> 00:15:35.780
sensing as I the very first function we talked about in this series is dedicated

309
00:15:35.781 --> 00:15:39.350
the categorization of facts and details about the immediate sensory world.

310
00:15:39.470 --> 00:15:43.160
It works fairly interesting and MTPs as they use it to reinforce the functioning

311
00:15:43.161 --> 00:15:46.490
of Tbi in any drawing on things which they've experienced or learned and

312
00:15:46.491 --> 00:15:49.730
analyzing.
The trial and error mentality evolves with that PSI.
However,

313
00:15:49.731 --> 00:15:53.690
as its function is introverted MTPs maybe less interested in being involved with

314
00:15:53.691 --> 00:15:54.471
the external world,

315
00:15:54.471 --> 00:15:57.560
which complements their desire to live inside of their heads fairly well.

316
00:15:57.830 --> 00:16:02.060
And TJ is for,
for se extroverted sensing.
So there may be somewhat more athletic,

317
00:16:02.061 --> 00:16:05.720
may be more where trends and such and they dress better and may have more of an

318
00:16:05.721 --> 00:16:09.560
appreciation for the external world and living in the moment and accordingly

319
00:16:09.800 --> 00:16:13.730
participating in the next in a world which complements and t very well as they

320
00:16:13.731 --> 00:16:17.180
may impulsively and without hesitation drunk right into their plans or projects

321
00:16:17.181 --> 00:16:19.940
and maintain a cool head within such situations.

322
00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:24.350
So in conclusion and teas are rational,
bright,
independent minded,
enthusiastic,

323
00:16:24.351 --> 00:16:25.220
creative and laid back.

324
00:16:25.221 --> 00:16:28.730
People they enjoy learning about a variety of systems have a knack for solving

325
00:16:28.731 --> 00:16:31.820
problems logically and reading in between the lines and are usually proud of

326
00:16:31.821 --> 00:16:34.040
their originality and independence.
However,

327
00:16:34.041 --> 00:16:36.770
they may have difficulty with others insight which are contradictory to what

328
00:16:36.771 --> 00:16:37.521
makes sense to them,

329
00:16:37.521 --> 00:16:41.060
especially where emotions are concerned and nts may have to learn to adjust

330
00:16:41.061 --> 00:16:44.690
their rationale to fit values and ideal human relations taking into account the

331
00:16:44.691 --> 00:16:45.131
emotions,

332
00:16:45.131 --> 00:16:49.130
but as and learning to manage their own and Tcu improve themselves on these

333
00:16:49.131 --> 00:16:52.760
drawbacks and capitalize on their talents have a full potential to make a big

334
00:16:52.761 --> 00:16:53.660
difference in the world.

335
00:16:53.720 --> 00:16:58.720
Now for some NT statistics and t's constitute 10.3% of the US population.

336
00:16:59.150 --> 00:17:04.150
The INTP makes it a 3.3% the ENTP makes it a 3.2% the IMTJ makes up 2.1% and the

337
00:17:05.691 --> 00:17:10.370
ENT j makes up 1.8% famous INTP is include Abraham Lincoln,

338
00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:14.510
Charles Darwin,
Karl Marx,
Marie Curie,
and Tina Fey.
And also myself.

339
00:17:14.630 --> 00:17:16.550
Not that I'm necessarily famous,
but anyway,

340
00:17:16.640 --> 00:17:20.690
it miss ETPs include Benjamin Franklin,
Richard Fiman,
Socrates,
John Cleese,

341
00:17:20.691 --> 00:17:21.530
and Stephen Fry.

342
00:17:21.860 --> 00:17:25.380
Feminists Imtj is include Isaac Newton and Ran Friedrich Nietzsche,

343
00:17:25.410 --> 00:17:29.450
Mark Zuckerberg,
and Patrick Stewart and famous e andJ is include Aristotle,

344
00:17:29.451 --> 00:17:32.780
Julius Caesar,
Napoleon,
Bill Gates,
and Alexander Hamilton.
Well,

345
00:17:32.781 --> 00:17:34.220
that's the nts in a nutshell.

346
00:17:34.221 --> 00:17:38.030
And we have now covered all 16 types and a decent amount of depth as well as of

347
00:17:38.031 --> 00:17:41.450
course videos explaining the cognitive functions and the NBTI letters.

348
00:17:41.451 --> 00:17:45.470
But one big topic remains,
and it's kind of the elephant in the room,

349
00:17:45.620 --> 00:17:49.620
how accurate,
consistent,
applicable,
and scientific is.
All of this stuff.

350
00:17:49.650 --> 00:17:52.200
A lot of people are concerned that it's just the next strategy.

351
00:17:52.201 --> 00:17:55.320
Some people think that it's maybe nice to know,
but ultimately useless.

352
00:17:55.321 --> 00:17:58.530
So in the next video we'll be exploring the validity of Myers Briggs type

353
00:17:58.531 --> 00:18:00.410
personalities and addressing counter arguments.

354
00:18:00.411 --> 00:18:04.140
So stay tuned for more videos on subjects like this in a wide variety of other

355
00:18:04.141 --> 00:18:08.070
ones.
