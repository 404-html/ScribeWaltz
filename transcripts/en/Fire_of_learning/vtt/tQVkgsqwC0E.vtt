00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:05.700
Hello and welcome the fire of learning.

2
00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:10.890
The African pygmys or the Congo pygmies are one of the most unusual and

3
00:00:10.891 --> 00:00:13.590
interesting groups of people on the entire planet.

4
00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:19.130
Hailing from central Africa and the modern countries of the Democratic Republic

5
00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.450
of the Congo,
Uganda,
Rwanda,
Burundi,

6
00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:26.130
the Republic of the Congo and other neighboring countries to people are named

7
00:00:26.131 --> 00:00:28.320
for their unusual short stature.

8
00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.820
The word pygmy comes from the Greek word [inaudible],
which means dwarf.

9
00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:38.300
The average male comes in at four foot 11 inches on average or 1.5 meters,

10
00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.960
much shorter than the average of the neighboring band,

11
00:00:41.961 --> 00:00:46.200
two populations and much in Subsaharan Africa averaging at five,

12
00:00:46.201 --> 00:00:51.201
six or 1.6800000000000002 meters as groups to pygmies often prefer to be

13
00:00:51.511 --> 00:00:56.250
referred to by their regional group names rather than by the collective general

14
00:00:56.251 --> 00:00:57.690
term.
Pygmy though,

15
00:00:57.691 --> 00:01:01.740
as there is no alternative group name for these people as a whole,

16
00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.960
the word remains in use academically.

17
00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:08.760
The three main categories here are the Mbanga located here,

18
00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.990
the in booty located here,
and the terroir located here.

19
00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:18.080
Within these three groups are around 12 subgroups and total there are between at

20
00:01:18.091 --> 00:01:23.091
900,000 and a million pygmies living in the central African rain forest up to

21
00:01:23.611 --> 00:01:26.370
60% of which live in the DRC.

22
00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.000
Though these groups share common traits and lifestyles.

23
00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.670
Some groups are not even related to each other.

24
00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:37.730
Having diverged from each other as far back as 20,000 years ago for unknown

25
00:01:38.041 --> 00:01:42.060
reasons,
possibly displacement by other people's or changing climate,

26
00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.820
separating east from west altogether,

27
00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:49.380
the pygmies diverged from other African peoples over 60,000 years ago.

28
00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:50.490
Keep in mind,

29
00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:54.930
Europeans have only been in Europe for about 30,000 years and indigenous

30
00:01:54.931 --> 00:01:59.490
Americans only arrived to the Americas around 17,000 years ago.

31
00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.810
The species,
Homo sapiens in general is about 200,000 years old.

32
00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.400
This makes the African pygmys one of the most ancient and genetically distinct

33
00:02:08.401 --> 00:02:09.540
peoples on the planet.

34
00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.530
Second only to native Khoisan populations of South Africa.

35
00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:14.850
In regard to age.

36
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.290
The pygmies are believed to be the direct descendants of African stone age

37
00:02:19.291 --> 00:02:23.820
hunter gatherers though their origins and genetic makeup are a subject of great

38
00:02:23.821 --> 00:02:26.520
debate and a number of different theories.

39
00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:31.610
They as a group existed considerably isolated from other African populations

40
00:02:31.801 --> 00:02:36.801
only until relatively recently having been disturbed by Bantu populations around

41
00:02:36.991 --> 00:02:41.100
two to 3000 years ago and the band to expansion.
However,

42
00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:45.810
genetic evidence shows few foreigners have left a genetic mark and pygmy DNA

43
00:02:45.811 --> 00:02:47.550
before this time.
However,

44
00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:52.440
there is more pigment DNA in surrounding people's suggesting women were chosen

45
00:02:52.441 --> 00:02:57.060
as wives by other groups and were removed from their tribes and the main pygmy

46
00:02:57.061 --> 00:03:02.061
gene pool increased between peoples came during the aforementioned banned to

47
00:03:02.321 --> 00:03:06.670
expansion a period where the Bantu people from modern west Africa began

48
00:03:06.671 --> 00:03:08.500
expanding throughout the continent,

49
00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:12.850
driven by agriculture and later by 400 BC.
The use of iron.

50
00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.710
Much of this expansion is still a mystery as there is limited archaeology in the

51
00:03:17.711 --> 00:03:20.710
region and very little in the way of written records.

52
00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:24.940
The pygmy population possibly went through a bottleneck in his time and

53
00:03:24.941 --> 00:03:29.770
fractured into the various smaller groups of today as disease at the pygmies and

54
00:03:29.771 --> 00:03:31.690
conflict between the two groups arose.

55
00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:37.010
The van who's still very much around today constitute much of the population of

56
00:03:37.211 --> 00:03:41.890
southern and central Africa and are the dominant group of the nations in which

57
00:03:41.891 --> 00:03:42.850
the pygmies live.

58
00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:48.070
The two groups began interacting and trading in his time as well and today much

59
00:03:48.071 --> 00:03:52.300
of the pygmy languages are heavily influenced by Ben two languages.
In fact,

60
00:03:52.301 --> 00:03:53.530
they are mostly Bantu.

61
00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:58.860
The origin of the short stature of the African pygmys is another subject which

62
00:03:59.081 --> 00:04:04.081
is not well understood as it is unclear if the eastern and western pygmies

63
00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:09.480
diverged from a common short ancestor or if they adapted the same traits

64
00:04:09.991 --> 00:04:14.991
separately in a response to a similar environment known in biology as convergent

65
00:04:15.041 --> 00:04:15.874
evolution.

66
00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:20.590
The latter possibility is supported by the fact that eastern and western pygmies

67
00:04:20.591 --> 00:04:22.270
have different growth patterns.

68
00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:27.370
A subject which we'll get into the shared environment of the two being of
course,

69
00:04:27.371 --> 00:04:31.360
the Central African jungle to which for unknown reasons,
again,

70
00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:33.610
possibly climate change or displacement,

71
00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.890
they were restricted because of their hunter gatherer lifestyle.
Today,

72
00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:43.060
the eastern and western pygmies not only consider themselves separate,

73
00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:46.600
but many have little knowledge of the other's existence,

74
00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:50.140
highlighting just how separated they are,
the short stature,

75
00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:55.270
one of the shortest of any people in the world may have evolved for a number of

76
00:04:55.271 --> 00:05:00.040
reasons,
possibly a combination including a lack of protein and the forest and

77
00:05:00.041 --> 00:05:02.020
environments,
a lack of sunlight,

78
00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:06.340
which leads to a lack of vitamin D and thus having a shorter build would mean

79
00:05:06.341 --> 00:05:11.341
needing less and adaptation to requiring fewer calories to survive in a harsher

80
00:05:11.711 --> 00:05:12.670
jungle environment.

81
00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:17.560
Increased mobility in the forest or to regulate body temperature in grid or heat

82
00:05:17.561 --> 00:05:18.394
and humidity.

83
00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:23.700
Pygmies reached their mature height at the age of 11 to 13 it is unknown when

84
00:05:24.701 --> 00:05:29.410
the pygmies first entered the historical record as they themselves had no system

85
00:05:29.411 --> 00:05:34.240
of writing and references to shorter African people are ambiguous.

86
00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:39.480
An example of this is an ancient Egyptian reference to the dancing dwarves of a

87
00:05:39.581 --> 00:05:43.630
far off land.
This may be one of the earliest accounts of the pygmies,

88
00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:48.520
but it could also refer to a number of other peoples including mythological

89
00:05:48.521 --> 00:05:49.240
ones.

90
00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:53.740
The Bantu who haven't habit in the region for the past few thousand years often

91
00:05:53.741 --> 00:05:56.680
regard them as inferiors because of their forest dwelling,

92
00:05:56.681 --> 00:05:58.070
hunter gathering lifestyle,

93
00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:03.130
a perspective which lasts this day as we'll get into when Europeans arrived in

94
00:06:03.291 --> 00:06:06.410
the 19th century to explore Africa more thoroughly,

95
00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:11.000
they came to share this perspective and had little interest in them apart from a

96
00:06:11.001 --> 00:06:13.910
scientific or anthropological curiosity.

97
00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:18.860
The Belgians who had come to dominate much of the Congo even brought many to be

98
00:06:18.861 --> 00:06:22.700
featured in anthropology exhibits in Europe and the US,

99
00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:26.000
which in some circumstances were basically zoos.

100
00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:31.210
The most famous example was a pygmy named Ota Benga brought to the United States

101
00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:35.420
whom visitors took a great interest in for the story of his origins,

102
00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:37.220
his height and his teeth.

103
00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:42.340
Pygmy teeth are often richly sharpened and youth which in their culture is found

104
00:06:42.411 --> 00:06:43.580
to be attractive.

105
00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:48.670
His life story is a tragic one as just as he was on the verge of returning home.

106
00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:51.650
World War One broke out,
preventing has returned,

107
00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:56.120
sending him into a depression and he committed suicide while living and working

108
00:06:56.121 --> 00:06:56.954
in Virginia.

109
00:06:57.320 --> 00:07:02.320
The internal culture and lifestyle of the pygmies is very unique as a people

110
00:07:02.601 --> 00:07:04.310
depending on the jungle forest,

111
00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:07.430
their mythology and religion is very focused on it,

112
00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:09.770
believing it to be a sacred place.

113
00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:13.850
Marriage is often arranged by the tribes where men exchange,

114
00:07:13.851 --> 00:07:16.010
sisters and husbands present.

115
00:07:16.011 --> 00:07:19.190
A wife's parents with an antelope has killed on his own.

116
00:07:19.370 --> 00:07:22.130
There are notable instances of polygamy,

117
00:07:22.190 --> 00:07:26.660
though marriage is seen as very important and these soul times sexual

118
00:07:26.661 --> 00:07:29.240
intercourse and reproduction is permitted.

119
00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:34.700
Pygmies seem to reach maturity faster than other humans with girls as young as

120
00:07:34.701 --> 00:07:39.380
eight being capable of reproduction.
Linguistically,
the group,
as I said,

121
00:07:39.381 --> 00:07:43.760
speaks a number of largely banned two languages,
but also French,

122
00:07:43.850 --> 00:07:46.250
especially when interacting with non-Pygmies,

123
00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:48.830
which is an aftereffect of Belgian rule.

124
00:07:48.950 --> 00:07:53.570
The group often lacks clear power structures and social structures except when

125
00:07:53.571 --> 00:07:58.310
hunting where the most experienced and efficient males are essentially made

126
00:07:58.311 --> 00:08:00.860
leader.
The groups often work cohesively.

127
00:08:01.070 --> 00:08:05.990
Those who break rules within society are sometimes scorned,
beaten or banished.

128
00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:10.370
However,
on the whole they are stereotypically considered a peaceful,

129
00:08:10.371 --> 00:08:12.410
cooperative and gentle people.

130
00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:16.610
They are often well known for their music which is polyphonic and a part of

131
00:08:16.611 --> 00:08:20.810
everyday life singing quite often while working on various tasks.

132
00:08:20.990 --> 00:08:24.740
While they have prospered for thousands of years in this lifestyle when left on

133
00:08:24.741 --> 00:08:28.040
their own,
there are very poorly integrated into modern African,

134
00:08:28.070 --> 00:08:29.930
specifically Bantu to society.

135
00:08:30.050 --> 00:08:34.340
I mentioned earlier that the band twos regard pygmies as inferiors.

136
00:08:34.370 --> 00:08:38.390
Though this is an understatement when you look at the modern relationship

137
00:08:38.391 --> 00:08:43.340
between the two effectively many band twos to not even consider pygmies actual

138
00:08:43.341 --> 00:08:48.140
humans.
In the DRC where pygmies are 2% of the population,

139
00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:52.100
they are often slaves who are occasionally paid and things like clothing,

140
00:08:52.101 --> 00:08:55.830
cigarettes and alcohol.
Of course,
pay is not guaranteed.

141
00:08:55.980 --> 00:09:00.780
Pygmies are not viewed as true citizens.
They are denied land rights,
education,

142
00:09:00.830 --> 00:09:04.200
healthcare,
citizenship and political representation.

143
00:09:04.770 --> 00:09:09.540
Many African companies involving logging food production and poaching often

144
00:09:09.541 --> 00:09:14.100
encroach on her land,
threatening their native lifestyle along with height.

145
00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:14.971
The IQ,

146
00:09:14.971 --> 00:09:19.140
average and life expectancies of the pygmies are some of the lowest in the world

147
00:09:19.141 --> 00:09:21.690
as well.
These people are accordingly,

148
00:09:21.780 --> 00:09:25.290
often greatly on the losing end of any conflict in this region.

149
00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:30.450
During the 1994 over one in genocide orchestrated by the Hutu government,

150
00:09:30.510 --> 00:09:35.510
nearly one third of the pygmy population or 10,000 people were killed in a much

151
00:09:36.841 --> 00:09:39.000
worse incident known as a Foss Sila,

152
00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:44.040
tableau and the Second Congo war up to 70,000 pygmies were killed in a genocide.

153
00:09:44.250 --> 00:09:47.670
These killings were greatly unusual as the pygmy say,

154
