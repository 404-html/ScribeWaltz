15
00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:55.620
15 Frankenstein is nothing.
Even the monster.
It is a name of the monsters crater.

16
00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:58.800
16 the sun is not only thousands of miles away.

17
00:00:58.801 --> 00:01:00.900
It is 93 million miles away.

18
00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:06.200
17 Santa Claus or even his modern image was not created by Coca Cola.

19
00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.780
18 seasons are not caused by distance from the sun,

20
00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.610
but rather the way the earth is tilted.

21
00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.360
19 is very unlikely that your eyes will pop out of your skull if you keep them

rather skinny 27 Buddha is not a god either.

31
00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:49.590
28 life expectancy does not necessarily refer to the age that most adults die.

32
00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:52.980

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:57.420
29 it is not required that you go unconscious to experience a concussion.

difference between west described as micro and macro evolution.

38
00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:16.410

33 frogs to notice at attempt to escape water that becomes too hot.

40
00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:24.570
34 agnosticism is not being unsure about religion.

35 dinosaurs.

42
00:02:29.041 --> 00:02:32.250
We're not all as violent or large as they are portrayed in movies.

43
00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:36.420
The velociraptor,
for example,
was about three feet tall and had feathers.

44
00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:39.660
36 humans have many more than just five senses.

45
00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.870
37 shaving does not cause hair to grow back.
Thicker.

38 red heads are not going extinct.

47
00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:48.210
39 Wikipedia pages may have errors,

48
00:02:48.211 --> 00:02:50.670
but the site is typically a reliable source.

49
00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:54.450
40 alcohol does not make you warmer though it may make you feel that way.

50
00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:59.290
41 the differences between the right and the left brain are very exaggerated and

51
00:02:59.291 --> 00:03:03.790
not black and white.
40 to smoking marijuana has not been shown to cure cancer.

52
00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:06.790

54
00:03:10.451 --> 00:03:12.580

50 Isaac Newton did not discover gravity by getting hit in the head with an

61
00:03:31.871 --> 00:03:33.850
apple.

62
00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:37.810
51 your body is perfectly capable of detoxing itself.

63
00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:42.840
52 low testosterone is a rare condition as often portrayed and many testosterone

64
00:03:42.911 --> 00:03:44.380
supplements did not actually work.

65
00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:48.670
53 it's more common for acting to be caused by the stress from an unhealthy diet

66
00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:50.020
rather than the food itself.

67
00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:54.400
54 eating unhealthy food that tastes good does not actually make people happy.

68
00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:58.540
In the long run exacerbates negative feelings and lowers quality of life.

69
00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:02.590
53 wealthy Romans did not actually vomit at their meals to keep eating.

70

56 the Bible does not claim that Jesus was born on December 25th 57 people have

71
00:04:08.291 --> 00:04:11.200
known that the earth was a globe since ancient times.

72
00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:14.500
58 Marie Antoinette never said let them eat cake.

73
00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:18.190
59 human blood low in oxygen is not actually blue.

74
00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:22.990
60 the concept of visual versus auditory learning does not have much foundation

75
00:04:22.991 --> 00:04:27.130
in science.
61 IQ cannot be determined from a 20 question.

76
00:04:27.131 --> 00:04:32.131
Online test 62 there is a scientific basis for the reliability of Iq tests.

63 not everyone from the Middle East is Arabic Persians,

78
00:04:36.971 --> 00:04:40.300
Turks and Kurds.

88
00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:17.860
73 apple computers can get viruses.

89
00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:22.890
74 it's perfectly fine and recommended to wake sleepwalkers 75 humans and

90
00:05:23.741 --> 00:05:25.480
dinosaurs did not coexist.

91
00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:28.840
76 humans did not evolve from chimpanzees.

92
00:05:28.841 --> 00:05:30.700
We rather share a common ancestor.

93
00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:35.170
77 the United States constitution was not written on hemp paper.

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:49.090
81 much of Sigmund Freud's work has actually been shown to be false.

98
00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:53.830
82 overpopulation is mostly a problem in underdeveloped countries.

99
00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:55.870
Developed countries like the United States,
Germany,

100
00:05:55.871 --> 00:05:59.540
and Japan have either stable or even decreasing birth rates.

101
00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:03.380
83 golf does not stand for gentlemen.
Only ladies forbidden.

102
00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:05.600
84 dogs do not feel guilt.

103
00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:10.520
They feel sadness and anxiety and anticipation of and during punishment 85 we

104
00:06:10.521 --> 00:06:14.390
are not born with all the neurons will ever have neurons can be created.

105
00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:18.800
86 there is no scientific evidence that people have photographic memories,

106
00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:20.780
just extraordinarily good memories.

107
00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:23.810
87 the French have not always surrendered and worse.

108
00:06:23.811 --> 00:06:26.930
They have a rather extensive history of military success.

109
00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:30.230
88 America is not the most obese nation in the world.

110
00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:32.420
It has the highest number of obese people,

111
00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:37.450
but in comparison this is only 33.7% of the population which puts it in 19th

112
00:06:38.181 --> 00:06:41.960
place.
89 Ireland is not still a part of the United Kingdom.

113
00:06:41.961 --> 00:06:46.160
The North Ireland is 90 the British are not consuming the most in the world.

114
00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:50.570
That would be Turkey followed by Ireland and then the UK 91 there are speed

115
00:06:50.571 --> 00:06:55.460
limits on German roads.
It just not the autobon 92 not all Canadian speak French,

116
00:06:55.490 --> 00:06:59.000
generally only French Canadians who consider themselves a separate group speak

117
00:06:59.001 --> 00:07:03.440
natively.
93 Australia is home to a variety of dangerous animals,

118
00:07:03.441 --> 00:07:06.350
but that's from encounters with them are relatively rare.

119
00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:09.350
94 New Zealand is not a part of Australia,

120
00:07:09.410 --> 00:07:13.130
but it is true that there were more sheep on New Zealand's than people like 10

121
00:07:13.131 --> 00:07:13.940
times more.

122
00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:18.680
95 the five second rule is nonexistent bacteria are not that polite.

123
00:07:18.870 --> 00:07:23.450
96 there is no evidence to full moons correlate with higher rates of crime or

124
00:07:23.451 --> 00:07:24.290
odd behavior.

125
00:07:24.370 --> 00:07:28.670
97 it is not true that NASA spent millions of dollars trying to develop a pen

126
00:07:28.671 --> 00:07:33.671
that would work in space 98 the chemical trip defen found in Turkey doesn't make

127
00:07:33.681 --> 00:07:34.251
you sleepy.

128
00:07:34.251 --> 00:07:37.550
Rather it's most likely that you get sleepy on Thanksgiving because you have

129
00:07:37.551 --> 00:07:38.390
eaten so much.

130
00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:43.340
99 alcohol is not legal because it is less dangerous than other drugs.
In fact,

131
00:07:43.341 --> 00:07:46.580
it has been shown to be more harmful than many drugs which are illegal.

132
00:07:46.610 --> 00:07:51.610
100 there isn't an association between increased milk consumption and lower bone

133
00:07:51.801 --> 00:07:54.710
fractures.
I hope you've enjoyed busting these myths.

134
00:07:54.740 --> 00:07:56.930
If you have one of your own that you'd like to set straight,

Thank you for watching.
