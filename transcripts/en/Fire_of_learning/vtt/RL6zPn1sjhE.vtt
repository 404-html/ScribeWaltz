Hello and welcome the fire of learning the Huizar ski on Yola,

2
00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.470
known as the Polish winged Huizar is in English.

3
00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.580
We're one of the most elite and important groups of cavalry within the Polish

4
00:00:11.581 --> 00:00:16.290
army for over 200 years.
The image which defines them of course,

5
00:00:16.291 --> 00:00:20.760
were the large wings made from the feathers of ostriches eagles are swans,

6
00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.990
which are either attached to the backs of their armor or to their horses
saddles,

7
00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.140
but there was much more to these,
his ours than just show.

8
00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.180
They were in fact some of the most fearsome and successful soldiers in history.

9
00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:38.510
The origins of Huizar than general dates back to the 15th century when Serbian

10
00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:43.020
Horseman Leaving Their Homeland After Ottoman conquest were recruited into

11
00:00:43.021 --> 00:00:48.021
Hungarian armies as Light Cavalry with the success of these units to Polish,

12
00:00:48.181 --> 00:00:50.940
we're quick to follow with the first Polish reserve.

13
00:00:50.941 --> 00:00:55.800
Ours made of Serbian mercenary as well being around definitely by the year 1500

14
00:00:55.830 --> 00:01:00.240
but most likely a little earlier throughout the course of the 16th century,

15
00:01:00.241 --> 00:01:04.530
the WHO's ours turned from a mercenary light cavalry into a heavier elite

16
00:01:04.531 --> 00:01:08.220
cavalry made up of recruits from the Polish upper classes.

17
00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.510
One of their first great victories was at the battle of [inaudible] in which the

18
00:01:12.511 --> 00:01:14.190
Polish wing to czar is chased.

19
00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.510
The revolting soldiers from the city of Danzig all the way to the city gates

20
00:01:18.511 --> 00:01:23.511
killing over 4,000 men while losing less than 100 the angels of death,

21
00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.190
we're just beginning for over a century.

22
00:01:26.191 --> 00:01:29.940
They would rarely lose and we're often the deciding factor in many of the

23
00:01:29.941 --> 00:01:33.200
battles in which they fought battles such as Virginia,
cocaine,

24
00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:38.130
housing Ketchem to Chana levophed and the infamous battle of Vienna.

25
00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:39.450
They were shocked troops,

26
00:01:39.451 --> 00:01:43.740
meaning they were specialized troops trained to lead a tax and penetrate enemy

27
00:01:43.741 --> 00:01:46.410
lines at the battle of clue Shino.

28
00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:51.210
They defeated the Russians decisively despite being out in number five to one at

29
00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:52.200
coke and housing.

30
00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:57.230
The polls defeated as Swedish losing 200 and killing over 2000 and at the battle

31
00:01:57.991 --> 00:02:02.991
of Vienna 3000 wing to czars took part and the largest cavalry charge in history

32
00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:08.750
along with 15,000 Holly Romans under the command of the Polish King John

33
00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:09.420
Sobieski.

34
00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:14.420
The third this charge would route the demoralized and exhausted Ottoman army

35
00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:18.120
thus preventing further autumn and expansion into Europe forever.

36
00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:21.180
There is debate concerning the point of the wings on the armor.

37
00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:25.470
A large part of it was likely a part of psychological warfare.

38
00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:28.110
Not only were they a formidable site,

39
00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.480
especially when they're charging toward you,

40
00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:33.120
but they clap together and we're very loud,

41
00:02:33.121 --> 00:02:37.350
which might have intimidated enemy forces and scared their horses and also

42
00:02:37.351 --> 00:02:39.390
perhaps made their forest to look larger.

43
00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:41.850
They may have even offer protection from enemies,

44
00:02:41.851 --> 00:02:46.320
swords or lasso is and deaf in their own horses to the intimidation efforts of

45
00:02:46.321 --> 00:02:48.330
the enemy.
Speaking of which,

46
00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:52.140
whose Aras horses were also specially bred for speed,
strength,

47
00:02:52.141 --> 00:02:57.141
and endurance known sometimes as tarpon selling such a horse to someone outside

48
00:02:57.901 --> 00:03:02.901
of the Polish Lithuanian Commonwealth warranted the death penalty along with the

49
00:03:03.371 --> 00:03:07.750
wings and the horses that whose Aras were.
As I said,
well armed and armored,

50
00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:12.470
they often carried a lance to swords,
two pistols and an ax or a Warhammer.

51
00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:16.900
Even the armor was often light in order for them to be flexible and they often

52
00:03:16.901 --> 00:03:18.130
wore animal pelts.

53
00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:23.290
The primary tactic of the whose Aras was to charge the enemy lines then fall

54
00:03:23.291 --> 00:03:27.580
back and repeat the charge as was necessary until the enemy routed.

55
00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:32.260
They would even typically have spare Lance's in the supply wagons to repeat such

56
00:03:32.261 --> 00:03:33.040
charges.

57
00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:36.820
The Polish wing to Zara's would fight through the 18th century until they were

58
00:03:36.821 --> 00:03:41.821
officially disbanded in 1776 when their duties and roles and combat were

59
00:03:42.101 --> 00:03:45.970
replaced by a new force of light cavalry known as lawns,

60
00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:50.770
as heavy cavalry became easier to challenge with the greater effectiveness of

61
00:03:50.771 --> 00:03:51.430
infantry.

62
00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:55.720
Lighter cavalry were more favors than the wing desires and thus they were

63
00:03:55.721 --> 00:03:57.700
retired.
Yet to this day,

64
00:03:57.701 --> 00:04:02.701
they remain icons of Poland and its history as they dominated many battlefields

65
00:04:03.371 --> 00:04:06.610
of eastern and central Europe for over two centuries.

66
00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:09.670
