00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.710
Hello and welcome to fire of learning.

2
00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:05.790
So the first three videos we looked into viking in Norse history,

3
00:00:05.791 --> 00:00:07.170
ups this settlement of Finland.

4
00:00:07.171 --> 00:00:10.200
In the past video we tell the story from the Norse Sagas,

5
00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.770
which I hope to help you gain an insight into perspective of these people.

6
00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.880
And now we're in this video.
We're going to look at the Viking people themselves,

7
00:00:17.881 --> 00:00:21.720
their beliefs,
their society,
their language,
their culture,
et Cetera,
et cetera.

8
00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:24.900
So let's start out by talking a little bit about the science behind the great

9
00:00:24.901 --> 00:00:25.351
forest.

10
00:00:25.351 --> 00:00:30.351
At the Vikings were biking society was simply put divided into three social

11
00:00:30.391 --> 00:00:31.800
classes.
The Yarl's,

12
00:00:31.801 --> 00:00:34.830
the upperclass were marked by extensive wealth Lana's such things.

13
00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:36.780
The middleclass to Karl's,
he's,

14
00:00:36.781 --> 00:00:40.380
we're just the regular people who had worked various jobs and the various
things.

15
00:00:40.381 --> 00:00:43.500
I just farming and blacksmithing and fishing and crafting on all that.

16
00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:47.820
Below that was the thrall.
The thrall were essentially the slave class,

17
00:00:47.821 --> 00:00:50.430
but there were various ways one could end up in this class.

18
00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:53.520
He got taken from another land during a raid back to Scandinavia.

19
00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.710
You all used to became that person.
Slave.

20
00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.340
Other times if you owe someone money but did not have the resources to pay them

21
00:00:59.341 --> 00:01:02.850
back,
you'd be held him in this way until you had appropriately paid them back.

22
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.970
Thieves who were caught stealing with sometimes become the slaves of the people

23
00:01:05.971 --> 00:01:07.230
from whom they were stealing.

24
00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.730
These classes weren't as rigid as other classes and other places in the world

25
00:01:11.731 --> 00:01:15.360
such as the rest of Europe.
It was possible to move through them much easier.

26
00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:17.850
You're all could become poor enough to become Carlos.

27
00:01:17.851 --> 00:01:21.270
Carlos could get enough wealth to become a yarrow or they could end up as a

28
00:01:21.271 --> 00:01:22.250
thrall and a thrill.

29
00:01:22.251 --> 00:01:25.050
I could save and save up enough money to free him or herself.

30
00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.580
The lower rigidity partially exists because in the early Viking age especially,

31
00:01:29.581 --> 00:01:32.400
there wasn't a central leader of all the vikings.
Most tribes,

32
00:01:32.401 --> 00:01:35.550
their villages or towns sort of operated independently of each other,

33
00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:39.240
and this is very important because it shows that the Viking Raiders did not

34
00:01:39.241 --> 00:01:42.990
operate as a single force either.
They were fragmented bands,

35
00:01:42.991 --> 00:01:47.070
more like a thugs who really only sometime is coronate into larger efforts and

36
00:01:47.071 --> 00:01:50.490
that made it much harder to negotiate with them or predict their behavior.

37
00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:51.810
Back to the social classes,

38
00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.620
Jaros often housed many of their followers and provided them with food and

39
00:01:55.621 --> 00:01:58.710
supplies and such things.
They weren't just wealthy individuals.

40
00:01:58.711 --> 00:02:02.580
They were very much authority figures of their respective societies in return

41
00:02:02.581 --> 00:02:03.301
their followers,

42
00:02:03.301 --> 00:02:07.650
both Carlson slaves but sometimes follow them into battle and importantly join

43
00:02:07.651 --> 00:02:11.640
them on the viking raids.
The Vikings believe this social order to be ancient.

44
00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.250
It's creation dating back according to them to the God.

45
00:02:14.251 --> 00:02:18.190
Heimdall though is European feudalism spread.
In the Scandinavian Vikings,

46
00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:22.110
society's became more centralized.
The classes did eventually become more rigid.

47
00:02:22.111 --> 00:02:23.610
I was towards the end of the Viking age,

48
00:02:23.611 --> 00:02:26.430
so the majority of the time while women has,
we'll see,

49
00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:28.950
had more rights in north societies and the rest of Europe.

50
00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.160
We're in the same class as their father or husband.

51
00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:35.400
This social system with the vikings with a very different view of leaders and

52
00:02:35.401 --> 00:02:36.060
kings.

53
00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:39.780
It didn't see the URLs are kings as majestic figures of grand or they saw them

54
00:02:39.781 --> 00:02:44.190
more like we would see a politician today or even more so a successful business

55
00:02:44.191 --> 00:02:48.180
person,
someone who is intelligent,
obviously a very leader like cunning,
strong,

56
00:02:48.181 --> 00:02:52.290
et cetera.
Basically someone who deserves their position.
Having this perspective,

57
00:02:52.291 --> 00:02:55.860
the Viking has had little respect for the kings of the rest of Europe as a

58
00:02:55.861 --> 00:02:57.150
famous tale.
In fact,

59
00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:00.340
Danish Vikings and turned the court of King Charles and France.

60
00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:04.750
The king demanded that they kissed his foot to recognize his grander vikings did

61
00:03:04.751 --> 00:03:07.420
so by pulling the king out of his chair and holding up,

62
00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:10.660
holding his leg up in the air to kiss it.
Adding to this,

63
00:03:10.661 --> 00:03:13.870
as I've mentioned throughout the series of Vikings were more democratic than the

64
00:03:13.871 --> 00:03:17.650
European counterparts.
The average person had a say in local affairs.

65
00:03:17.651 --> 00:03:21.550
They voted on things and they were allowed to bear arms because the only writing

66
00:03:21.551 --> 00:03:22.480
was done in ruins.

67
00:03:22.481 --> 00:03:26.230
The vikings that a lot of things orally including maintain laws and government,

68
00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:28.930
Norse people often gathered into meetings,

69
00:03:28.931 --> 00:03:32.530
held that organized times called a ting or an English a thing.

70
00:03:32.531 --> 00:03:35.950
We talked a little bit about this already to discuss local affairs and make

71
00:03:35.951 --> 00:03:36.820
decisions on them.

72
00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:41.290
Sometimes it was to introduce new laws at the time to things acted as courts

73
00:03:41.291 --> 00:03:43.630
judging people for crimes and settling disputes.

74
00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:46.480
Those found guilty of crimes might have been declared outlaws,

75
00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:47.830
which was quite dangerous.

76
00:03:47.831 --> 00:03:52.810
Title to hold in North Society being an outlaw meant that not only were you

77
00:03:52.811 --> 00:03:56.590
deprive the receiving help from anyone but that anyone could kill you until your

78
00:03:56.591 --> 00:03:57.490
outlet.
She was up.

79
00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:01.750
Obviously these circumstances caused many declared outlaws to flee to a country

80
00:04:01.751 --> 00:04:03.670
in many such outlaws like Erik,

81
00:04:03.671 --> 00:04:08.410
the red contributed to the colonization of new lands disputes cause sometimes we

82
00:04:08.411 --> 00:04:10.930
settled by what's called a home gong or a duel.

83
00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:14.470
The two opponents would face off and battle and fight each other until either

84
00:04:14.471 --> 00:04:18.670
first blood or in some cases death nor society,
as I said,

85
00:04:18.671 --> 00:04:22.060
was a largely male dominated.
But women did have an interesting role in it.

86
00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:26.860
They were expected socially to tend to domestic affairs such as raising the
kids,

87
00:04:26.861 --> 00:04:30.160
maintain the livestock and gardens,
providing food,
et cetera.

88
00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:32.680
But while their husbands were away on rating trips,

89
00:04:32.681 --> 00:04:35.710
they took over all of the responsibilities of the household and women without

90
00:04:35.711 --> 00:04:40.120
husbands to represent them.
We're allowed to speak and even votes at the teens.

91
00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:42.580
Even though marriages were arranged at an early age,

92
00:04:42.581 --> 00:04:45.780
women have the power to divorce their husbands and for a man's abuses.

93
00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:49.510
Wife is seen as much more unacceptable and Viking society and the rest of Europe

94
00:04:49.511 --> 00:04:50.200
at the time.

95
00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:54.010
Some women even became wealthy landowners or even warriors alongside their

96
00:04:54.011 --> 00:04:54.730
husbands.

97
00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:58.450
Much of what we know about the Norris of this time from their perspective comes

98
00:04:58.451 --> 00:05:02.890
to us from the Icelanders because it was in Iceland that much of the history and

99
00:05:02.891 --> 00:05:04.570
such was first written down.

100
00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:08.710
I remember that I mentioned that much of Viking society was conducted orally and

101
00:05:08.711 --> 00:05:12.010
it wasn't until Christian missionaries went to Iceland that they taught the

102
00:05:12.011 --> 00:05:13.750
Icelanders to write down their stories.

103
00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:17.950
Then we may think these Icelandic people for taking the time to do stuff for

104
00:05:17.951 --> 00:05:21.520
without them,
our understanding of the vikings would be much less developed.

105
00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:25.000
Interestingly,
the Viking story that were written down and all Icelandic,

106
00:05:25.001 --> 00:05:28.390
not in Latin,
which was not typical of Christians at the time.

107
00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:30.010
Speaking of Viking languages,

108
00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:34.210
the vikings from Greenland to Constantinople spoke a variety of dialects of the

109
00:05:34.211 --> 00:05:38.270
language we now call old Norris or what they called back then,
the donk,

110
00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:40.090
tuna or Dane tone.

111
00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:44.560
Old Norse languages were inflected languages with three grammatical genders.

112
00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:46.490
Language was written prior to Christianity.

113
00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:50.530
You mainly in ruins though afterwards to develops Latin tie of alphabet.

114
00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:54.370
All the Norris has a dramatic language,
much like German and English.

115
00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:57.800
The languages of the Vikings would eventually evolve into Danish,

116
00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:02.480
Swedish and Norwegian fairways,
Icelandic,
and even an influence in English.

117
00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:07.310
Words we use today such as anger,
happiness,
law,
bug,
lake illness,

118
00:06:07.311 --> 00:06:11.450
birth,
dirt,
a geyser guest.
He then haunt mistake,

119
00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:14.060
outlaw race,
raise regret.

120
00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:17.240
Rugged Rodan skills sprint Thursday.

121
00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:22.100
They ugly wing are all words brought to us from the Vikings.

122
00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:26.210
Here's an example of old north speech from someone else as I don't speak the

123
00:06:26.211 --> 00:06:27.140
language myself.

Artists send them from this similar sounding language.

134
00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:11.830
It was viking technology which allowed them to achieve such access in the

135
00:07:11.831 --> 00:07:12.670
medieval age.

136
00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:16.480
One of their greatest and most notable technological achievements is the Viking

137
00:07:16.481 --> 00:07:19.930
ship Viking.
Long shifts are crafted from oak tree is,

138
00:07:19.931 --> 00:07:23.230
and we're at times large enough to hold a hundred men who has not only the

139
00:07:23.231 --> 00:07:25.630
shifts,
however,
but the vikings navigational abilities,

140
00:07:25.631 --> 00:07:29.920
a facilitated their conquests.
How the vikings navigated is somewhat a mystery.

141
00:07:29.921 --> 00:07:33.760
Obviously they had an extensive knowledge of nature using the sun and stars to

142
00:07:33.761 --> 00:07:35.170
determine direction.
However,

143
00:07:35.171 --> 00:07:38.960
these were unavailable when it was cloudy out of Vikings,
off he was landmarks.

144
00:07:38.980 --> 00:07:42.490
However,
in the middle of the ocean,
this would,
this would have been hard to do.

145
00:07:42.670 --> 00:07:46.060
They also used very likely the direction of the waves and the behavior of the

146
00:07:46.061 --> 00:07:50.260
animals like birds and whales.
Their methods allow them to get to North America,

147
00:07:50.261 --> 00:07:54.100
but they certainly were not perfect and many viking ships got lost and did not

148
00:07:54.101 --> 00:07:57.190
return.
Ships were of great importance and Viking culture.

149
00:07:57.191 --> 00:08:01.600
Obviously it was believes that people sail to the afterlife and many wealthy

150
00:08:01.601 --> 00:08:04.720
individuals and Viking society were buried in their shifts along with their

151
00:08:04.721 --> 00:08:07.330
treasures.
The vikings were typically always armed.

152
00:08:07.331 --> 00:08:11.410
Even some women and children would carry knives.
Weapons included swords,

153
00:08:11.411 --> 00:08:15.030
axes and spears with swords being used mostly by the wealthy do today,

154
00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:18.650
difficulty to craft North's religion was also in a central park.

155
00:08:18.700 --> 00:08:20.050
Their identity in lifestyle,

156
00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:25.150
blacking religion known to us today as North and mythology and to them simply as

157
00:08:25.151 --> 00:08:29.860
the traditions or the beliefs is very similar to the rest of dramatic paganism.

158
00:08:30.340 --> 00:08:34.150
The religion was polytheistic believing in many gods and the cyclic believing

159
00:08:34.151 --> 00:08:37.360
that the world simply ended and recreated itself.
Incidentally,

160
00:08:37.540 --> 00:08:41.020
the North's believe that in the beginning there was only an empty void called

161
00:08:41.021 --> 00:08:43.030
Dick and none could gap.
They're going doing again.

162
00:08:43.040 --> 00:08:46.360
I've existed in between two separate rounds,
multiple Haim,

163
00:08:46.361 --> 00:08:48.940
the realm of fire and niffle Haim,
the realm of ice.

164
00:08:49.060 --> 00:08:50.950
Eventually these two opposite,
we're almost,

165
00:08:50.951 --> 00:08:55.951
you're closer and closer to each other and upon colliding created the being Ian

166
00:08:56.281 --> 00:08:57.330
here,
the giants,

167
00:08:57.480 --> 00:09:00.880
the fire melted the ice and other gods and the north called the ice.

168
00:09:00.881 --> 00:09:05.190
Here emerged from the eyes are the most popular known Norse gods or Odin,

169
00:09:05.191 --> 00:09:08.820
a mysterious God of war and wisdom who wrote a six legged horse and often

170
00:09:08.821 --> 00:09:12.300
interfered in the affairs of people leading many of vikings to claim to be

171
00:09:12.310 --> 00:09:13.770
descended from him.
Thor,

172
00:09:13.771 --> 00:09:18.030
the most popular north God was a warrior who protected the realm of the gods as

173
00:09:18.031 --> 00:09:19.320
guard with his hammer,

174
00:09:19.321 --> 00:09:23.910
which is father forwards in a star and lucky who was a trickster and a bit of an

175
00:09:23.911 --> 00:09:26.000
annoyance to the other gods.
One day look,

176
00:09:26.001 --> 00:09:28.470
he put a joke which led to the murder of Baldur,

177
00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:32.430
brother of the blind God hudder and he was subsequently and present for life.

178
00:09:32.490 --> 00:09:35.880
Norse mythology states though that Loki will bring about the end of time is when

179
00:09:35.881 --> 00:09:39.120
he escapes from imprisonment,
the Gods of as guard led by owed,

180
00:09:39.121 --> 00:09:42.720
and we'll go to war against the Loki leading the giants.
And in this battle,

181
00:09:42.721 --> 00:09:46.920
the giant serpent fenrir will enter into the world and consume everything before

182
00:09:46.921 --> 00:09:48.180
him,
including the sun.

183
00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:51.590
The whole world will then freeze and slowly turn back into a void,

184
00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:55.020
a void which existed in between the realm of fire and ice,

185
00:09:55.021 --> 00:09:59.100
which in time would begin to slowly move back toward each other and recreate the

186
00:09:59.101 --> 00:10:03.240
entire universe all again in death and Norse believe that they travel to an

187
00:10:03.241 --> 00:10:07.440
afterlife and the ways in which people lived and were buried guide them on in to

188
00:10:07.441 --> 00:10:10.380
the set for life,
such as the wealthy being varied in their shifts,

189
00:10:10.381 --> 00:10:14.220
but also throws being varied in such a way as to prevent them from coming back

190
00:10:14.221 --> 00:10:15.480
and haunting their masters.

191
00:10:15.660 --> 00:10:18.630
The North had a high respect for their ancestors and believe that taking care of

192
00:10:18.631 --> 00:10:19.650
the dead was necessary.

193
00:10:19.651 --> 00:10:23.190
Often this involves a leading food and gifts and such at their graves.

194
00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:27.720
Various afterlife existed in North [inaudible] mythologies such as [inaudible]

195
00:10:27.750 --> 00:10:31.500
hell and Helga feel,
most famous of which is Valhalla,

196
00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:33.990
where warriors been to be fair for riding a rock,

197
00:10:33.991 --> 00:10:37.020
the name of the last great battle in which the world would end.

198
00:10:37.500 --> 00:10:41.640
And so thus we see from all of this,
the vikings were not as simple,
murderous,

199
00:10:41.641 --> 00:10:45.840
barbaric people.
They had a very complex society and culture,
and in some ways,

200
00:10:45.841 --> 00:10:48.600
we're more developed and their European counterparts at the time.

201
00:10:48.660 --> 00:10:49.471
In the next video,

202
00:10:49.471 --> 00:10:52.980
we'll finish off this series by discussing how the Viking age eventually came to

203
00:10:52.981 --> 00:10:55.500
an answer.
I say tend to continue with the series.

204
00:10:55.501 --> 00:10:58.080
And for more videos like this and on many other subjects,

205
00:10:58.081 --> 00:11:00.360
we should have talked about fire and learning and subscribes.

206
00:11:00.420 --> 00:11:01.710
Thank you for watching.
