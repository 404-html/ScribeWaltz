Hello and welcome to fire of learning.

2
00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:06.310
<v 1>In the last few videos we've been talking about life on the moons of gas shine,</v>

3
00:00:06.311 --> 00:00:07.260
so we have to wonder,

4
00:00:07.261 --> 00:00:12.000
could life exists on a gas giant itself perhaps such as a planet Jupiter?

5
00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.260
It's an interesting question.
As such,
life especially at a multicellular level,

6
00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.500
what have to be considerably different from life here on our planet.

7
00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.790
A gas giant like Jupiter for starters probably does not have a solid surface.

8
00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.230
It's just atmosphere and atmosphere until you reach a molten core.
Accordingly,

9
00:00:28.231 --> 00:00:32.010
life on a guest join would have to exist in the atmosphere permanently airborne,

10
00:00:32.011 --> 00:00:35.850
and these organisms would have to be able to withstand the pressure and

11
00:00:35.851 --> 00:00:40.340
turbulence of a gas giants atmosphere.
The surface of a guest shine,

12
00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.380
especially one like Jupiter,
it would be extremely inhospitable.

13
00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:45.150
No life as we know it could exist.

14
00:00:45.151 --> 00:00:49.050
They're subjected to extreme heat and pressure is so intense that hydrogen is

15
00:00:49.051 --> 00:00:50.400
forced to become a solid.

16
00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.960
If single celled life could evolve in an environment like this in motion with no

17
00:00:54.961 --> 00:00:58.650
solid surface and from there multicellular life could possibly evolve,

18
00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:00.810
what would these organisms be like?
Well,

19
00:01:00.811 --> 00:01:04.950
the simplest possibility is perhaps a balloon like organism one which stays

20
00:01:04.951 --> 00:01:08.220
afloat in the atmosphere by inflating itself and adjusting that level of

21
00:01:08.221 --> 00:01:09.660
inflation to move around.

22
00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:14.460
These organisms may be photosynthetic like giant floating plans or since the sun

23
00:01:14.461 --> 00:01:16.020
won't be much dimmer this far out,

24
00:01:16.021 --> 00:01:18.300
they could feed off nutrients in the atmosphere.

25
00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.910
These could be massive like the size of cities.

26
00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.810
There couldn't be organisms which remain in the atmosphere just long enough only

27
00:01:24.811 --> 00:01:28.200
to reproduce and then sync to the core of the planet having accomplished their

28
00:01:28.201 --> 00:01:30.860
life goal.
There could be hunters in this environment.

29
00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:34.410
There were some equivalent organisms which feed off to floating organisms and

30
00:01:34.411 --> 00:01:36.990
perhaps organisms which feed off of those organisms.

31
00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:40.560
Intelligence though is unlikely.
Very,
very unlikely,

32
00:01:40.561 --> 00:01:44.190
as there is no environment on Jupiter in which intelligence would be necessary.

33
00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.560
Furthermore,
even if intelligence did evolve,

34
00:01:46.561 --> 00:01:50.400
there will be no materials in the atmosphere with which to make a civilization.

35
00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:51.960
Therefore,
in my opinion,

36
00:01:51.961 --> 00:01:55.320
it would be astonishing to find Joby and organisms with more than a feeble

37
00:01:55.321 --> 00:01:58.530
bundle of neurons for brain.
The possibilities go on,

38
00:01:58.531 --> 00:02:01.320
but how likely is it for Jupiter itself?

39
00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.190
What the majority of Jupiter's atmosphere isn't largely hydrogen with a decent

40
00:02:05.191 --> 00:02:09.300
amount of helium,
but also some traces of some other stuff like water,
carbon,

41
00:02:09.301 --> 00:02:13.710
oxygen,
ammonia,
et cetera.
Could these molecules come together to form life?

42
00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:18.030
Well,
the scarcity of these molecules mixed with the effect that Jupiter is very

43
00:02:18.031 --> 00:02:23.010
radioactive and the atmosphere is rough and turbulent makes it unlikely

44
00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:27.720
impossible.
No,
we're theorizing over,
yes,
worth exploring,

45
00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:30.450
yes,
but likely probably not,

46
00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.680
but there's still hope for gas giants as a whole.
Smaller guests,

47
00:02:34.681 --> 00:02:37.770
giants have larger amounts of the molecules that will be necessary for life,

48
00:02:37.771 --> 00:02:40.710
ones around the size of Neptune,
Uranus,
Uranus,

49
00:02:40.711 --> 00:02:43.590
and Neptune themselves that probably two in hospital for life,

50
00:02:43.591 --> 00:02:48.591
but exoplanets around that size close to their star especially could potentially

51
00:02:48.811 --> 00:02:50.130
harbor this kind of life.

52
00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:52.950
If you're ready to explore Jupiter and other gas giants for life,
