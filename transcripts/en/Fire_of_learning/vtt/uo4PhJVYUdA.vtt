Hello and them perhaps you've taken what's called a Myers Briggs type indicator,

2
00:00:04.951 --> 00:00:08.940
an Nbti the test which gives you the four letters that describe your

3
00:00:08.941 --> 00:00:13.290
psychological preferences.
It's good to understand what these four letters mean.

4
00:00:13.291 --> 00:00:17.070
But to do that you have to understand what the cognitive functions upon which

5
00:00:17.071 --> 00:00:21.990
they are based mean.
So what are the cognitive functions?
Well,
long story short,

6
00:00:21.991 --> 00:00:24.030
Carl Young,
a famous Swiss psychologist,

7
00:00:24.031 --> 00:00:28.770
specular that we humans have four main psychological functions for how we see

8
00:00:28.771 --> 00:00:33.720
the world and each of them has an extroverted and introverted type in four of

9
00:00:33.721 --> 00:00:35.280
these are dominant in us.

10
00:00:35.281 --> 00:00:40.281
While even though we use all eight extroverted or introverted feeling

11
00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.490
extroverted or introverted thinking,
extroverted or introverted,

12
00:00:44.491 --> 00:00:48.390
intuition and extroverted or introverted sensing.

13
00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.750
So have your main for cognitive functions you will have two which are

14
00:00:51.751 --> 00:00:56.340
extroverted and which are introverted.
But what do these even mean?
Well,

15
00:00:56.341 --> 00:01:00.390
let's get into explaining that.
Starting with feeling integrated,

16
00:01:00.391 --> 00:01:01.470
feeling abbreviated.

17
00:01:01.471 --> 00:01:05.850
F I introverted are feelers tend to navigate the world with a strong system of

18
00:01:05.851 --> 00:01:08.880
values and a focus on what is right and wrong.

19
00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.110
They tend to inspect other's actions this side if they are morally acceptable,

20
00:01:13.111 --> 00:01:15.210
and I don't mean to make them come off as rigid,

21
00:01:15.211 --> 00:01:17.520
Fr dominance are usually pretty easy going,

22
00:01:17.521 --> 00:01:22.230
but if if they sense that their value system has been broken significantly

23
00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.860
enough,
they will it have a strong urge to react to that.

24
00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:31.130
They tend to prefer to express themselves with feelings and actions rather than

25
00:01:31.201 --> 00:01:35.970
words.
Extroverted feeling abbreviated,
f e similar,

26
00:01:35.971 --> 00:01:40.260
but it has to do with more of a focus on the feelings and intentions of other

27
00:01:40.261 --> 00:01:43.350
people around them.
Effie dominance can be very leader,

28
00:01:43.351 --> 00:01:48.120
likes are good at maintaining group values and goals and adjusting themselves to

29
00:01:48.121 --> 00:01:51.840
accommodate others.
They can be very good teachers,
peacemakers and caregivers,

30
00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:57.320
but can also become too invested in certain people causing them to try to fix

31
00:01:57.451 --> 00:01:59.730
their undesirable qualities.

32
00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:04.730
Now for thinking introverted thinking,
abbreviated TEI,

33
00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.560
introverted thinking has to do with organizing,

34
00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:12.590
analyzing and evaluating things to fit it into the big picture or to understand

35
00:02:12.751 --> 00:02:13.830
the core of things.

36
00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:18.450
T I dominance tend to appreciate conciseness and objective reasoning as a part

37
00:02:18.451 --> 00:02:21.210
of their goal to understand the world around them.

38
00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:26.010
They often look for inconsistencies and arguments or actions or flaws in systems

39
00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:30.330
or theories and may mentally try to improve things to reach the best of all

40
00:02:30.331 --> 00:02:34.980
possibilities.
Extroverted thinking,
abbreviated Tbi.
Again,

41
00:02:34.981 --> 00:02:36.420
similar to extroverted thinking,

42
00:02:36.421 --> 00:02:41.421
but I suppose the main difference here is an introverted thinking tends to focus

43
00:02:41.881 --> 00:02:43.320
on how the world works.

44
00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:48.740
Extroverted thinking you could say is about a desire to make the world around

45
00:02:48.871 --> 00:02:49.704
them work.

46
00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:55.040
They're very good at organizing and efficiency and when they decide to

47
00:02:55.381 --> 00:02:59.890
accomplish a goal,
they're very good at finding ways to do it and generally,

48
00:02:59.891 --> 00:03:01.810
well,
they may come off as Bossy,

49
00:03:01.811 --> 00:03:05.500
but in reality what they're doing is trying to organize the world and to what

50
00:03:05.501 --> 00:03:09.970
they believe is necessary for the world to work,
not for intuition.

51
00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:11.980
Introverted intuition,

52
00:03:11.981 --> 00:03:16.981
abbreviated and I introverted intuiters are very good at noticing patterns or

53
00:03:18.101 --> 00:03:22.180
signs and they're good as not only finding relationships between things,

54
00:03:22.181 --> 00:03:25.810
but also how these relationships fit into the larger picture.

55
00:03:25.811 --> 00:03:29.560
Making them good at solving problems and planning for the future.

56
00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:32.950
When an eye dominance discover a link between two things.

57
00:03:32.951 --> 00:03:34.960
They often experience a Eureka moment,

58
00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:40.470
which is them fulfilling their own desire to find the links between a certain

59
00:03:40.541 --> 00:03:44.560
subject or their environment around them.
Extroverted intuition,

60
00:03:44.561 --> 00:03:46.080
abbreviated an e.

61
00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:49.780
Extroverted intuiters are good at finding relationships between things as well,

62
00:03:49.781 --> 00:03:54.730
but also entertaining multiple interpretations at once in finding hidden meaning

63
00:03:54.731 --> 00:03:58.120
behind the things they're good at.
Brainstorming new ideas.

64
00:03:58.121 --> 00:04:02.050
It can reach strong conclusions about their ideas very well.
However,

65
00:04:02.051 --> 00:04:06.820
living in the world of possibilities can make extroverted intuitors unsure of

66
00:04:06.821 --> 00:04:10.720
their conclusions or can cause them to have trouble sometimes making up their

67
00:04:10.721 --> 00:04:11.554
minds.

68
00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:16.710
Sensing introverted sensing abbreviated as I introverted sensing has to do with

69
00:04:17.231 --> 00:04:21.220
remembering the experiences you've had in detail and using them to compare them

70
00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:25.780
to other experiences you've had to find similarities and them introverted

71
00:04:25.781 --> 00:04:30.781
sensors are good at drawing on the past to deal with the present or near future.

72
00:04:31.331 --> 00:04:35.950
They pay attention to detail and use this to recognize things quickly.

73
00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:38.820
For example,
this can range from interpret.

74
00:04:38.821 --> 00:04:43.750
Sensors have been an easier time recognizing the similarities between two movies

75
00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:49.170
or recognizing a pattern that may lead eventually to something destructive

76
00:04:49.931 --> 00:04:52.720
because it has in the past,
extroverted sensing,

77
00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:57.220
abbreviated s e extroverted sensing has to do with experiencing the world around

78
00:04:57.221 --> 00:05:00.610
you in the form of sights,
sounds,
sensations,
etc.

79
00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:05.560
Extroverted sensors are good at noticing data from experiences and are good at

80
00:05:05.561 --> 00:05:07.660
making practical use of what they know.

81
00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:11.890
They also seek to understand the world around them and have it as desire to

82
00:05:11.891 --> 00:05:13.150
participate in it,

83
00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:17.620
leading them to enjoy activities such as sports or outdoor activities.

84
00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:20.200
So those are the age cognitive functions.
Yes,

85
00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:23.410
some of them may seem kind of similar and again,

86
00:05:23.411 --> 00:05:26.200
it's not immediately obvious how they match up with your Myers Briggs

87
00:05:26.201 --> 00:05:27.040
personality type.

88
00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:32.400
So let's take a look at that and we'll use a few types as example.

89
00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:35.590
We'll start with my type the I n,
t p.

90
00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:40.830
So as an INTP I and perhaps you have these four main cognitive functions are

91
00:05:41.531 --> 00:05:44.950
primary or what's called the dominant is introverted thinking.

92
00:05:44.951 --> 00:05:48.490
Tbi are secondary or auxiliary is extroverted.

93
00:05:48.491 --> 00:05:53.491
Intuition and e are third or tertiary is introverted sensing.

94
00:05:54.011 --> 00:05:57.250
And our fourth or inferior function is extroverted.

95
00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:01.400
So basically I ntps lead with a desire to analyze,

96
00:06:01.401 --> 00:06:04.670
categorize and evaluate their world,
followed by an e,

97
00:06:04.671 --> 00:06:08.340
which is the desire to interpret relationships and make connections and draw

98
00:06:08.341 --> 00:06:11.480
possibilities followed by introverted sensing,

99
00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:16.780
which has to do with drawing on past experiences to connect them to current

100
00:06:18.441 --> 00:06:20.990
events followed by extroverted feeling,

101
00:06:20.991 --> 00:06:25.991
which is used in a concern for the emotions and desires of other people around

102
00:06:26.151 --> 00:06:27.680
them and for social harmony.

103
00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:32.180
The other four unmentioned functions are still there of course,
but like I said,

104
00:06:32.181 --> 00:06:34.160
they're called the shadow functions.

105
00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:39.080
They still hold sway over the INTP thinking pattern.
You will still use them,

106
00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:44.240
but it is not as common and it's not a preferred way of doing things.
In fact,

107
00:06:44.241 --> 00:06:49.160
most types will prefer to use their first three functions and may have to

108
00:06:49.161 --> 00:06:53.090
develop their inferior function and their chateaux functions over time with

109
00:06:53.091 --> 00:06:56.220
maturity.
To take another type,
the ees FFP,

110
00:06:56.250 --> 00:06:58.920
the ESF p leaves with extroverted sensing,

111
00:06:58.921 --> 00:07:02.760
which is experiencing the world around them,
followed by introverted feeling,

112
00:07:02.761 --> 00:07:07.230
which is valuing and considering important,
followed by extroverted thinking,

113
00:07:07.231 --> 00:07:10.500
which is organizing their environment around them,
followed by introverted,

114
00:07:10.501 --> 00:07:12.840
intuiting,
looking into the future,

115
00:07:12.841 --> 00:07:16.680
trying to bring things together and understand the effects of things.

116
00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:21.270
So I hope you have a better understanding of this now and here are the 14 other

117
00:07:21.271 --> 00:07:25.010
types along with their cognitive functions.
So I hope I've covered the subject.

118
00:07:25.011 --> 00:07:26.260
Yeah.
In depth.
Um,

119
00:07:26.890 --> 00:07:31.890
in the future I may do a video explaining the 16 Myers Briggs types and their

120
00:07:32.171 --> 00:07:33.510
habits,
but for now,

121
00:07:33.511 --> 00:07:36.390
you may find more videos on many other subjects on my channel.

122
00:07:36.391 --> 00:07:38.250
And to keep up with these future videos,

123
00:07:38.251 --> 00:07:41.910
I would invite you to subscribe to fire of learning.
It's like if we're watching.
