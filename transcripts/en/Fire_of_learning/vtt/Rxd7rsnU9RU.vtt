00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:46.840
<v 1>My purpose in making this video is quite simply that I see the colorization of</v>

4
00:09:46.841 --> 00:09:51.070
these photographs as an extremely effective way to connect on a deeper level to

5
00:09:51.071 --> 00:09:51.820
the past.

6
00:09:51.820 --> 00:09:55.390
There is of course a value to photographs in their original black and white

7
00:09:55.391 --> 00:09:56.680
state,
but too many people,

8
00:09:56.830 --> 00:10:00.700
especially those of us who were born at a time in which car photography became

9
00:10:00.701 --> 00:10:04.660
the norm or the lack of color in these historic photographs almost seems to

10
00:10:04.690 --> 00:10:06.730
separate us from those time periods,

11
00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:09.910
these images from the civil war world war one,

12
00:10:10.030 --> 00:10:13.750
even world war two seem almost like our civilizations faded memories,

13
00:10:13.780 --> 00:10:17.530
distant remnants of our past.
When you add color to them,

14
00:10:17.620 --> 00:10:22.510
you realize just how important of a factor colorist to connecting in a sense of

15
00:10:22.511 --> 00:10:26.260
something to relate to it.
Viewing is so worse orders.
For example,

16
00:10:26.470 --> 00:10:29.710
he seemed like ghosts in black and white,
like ancient history,

17
00:10:29.860 --> 00:10:31.660
add color and the picture comes alive.

18
00:10:31.690 --> 00:10:33.610
You can place yourself was in it much easier.

19
00:10:33.670 --> 00:10:37.120
Their uniforms and their environment and their flesh are compared to the

20
00:10:37.121 --> 00:10:39.190
original,
all the more alive.

21
00:10:39.370 --> 00:10:42.100
You know there's picture from World War One could have been taken the other day

22
00:10:42.180 --> 00:10:43.630
and that was over a hundred years ago.

23
00:10:43.930 --> 00:10:47.950
It's easier to form a mental picture of and naturally ask and relate to what it

24
00:10:47.951 --> 00:10:52.420
might've been like on that day as opposed to a colorless antique of an archaic

25
00:10:52.421 --> 00:10:56.260
war.
We've only had photography since the early 19th century.

26
00:10:56.710 --> 00:11:01.540
This photo taken around 1826 is the earliest known photograph.
That's incredible.

27
00:11:01.660 --> 00:11:05.110
We can go back that far and see something,
a photograph,
and of course,

28
00:11:05.230 --> 00:11:09.910
keep in mind this has been greatly enhance from the 1820s just a decade after

29
00:11:09.911 --> 00:11:13.690
the Napoleonic wars,
only 50 years after the American war of independence.

30
00:11:13.780 --> 00:11:15.460
That's really cool in my opinion,

31
00:11:15.610 --> 00:11:19.690
but it means we've only been taking photographs for a little under 200 years and

32
00:11:19.691 --> 00:11:24.490
color photographs only we can a norm in the 1960s which is almost about 60
years,

33
00:11:24.670 --> 00:11:29.380
but the past 9,800 years of human civilization or so prior,

34
00:11:29.410 --> 00:11:34.410
there are zero photographs and we can connect to those times through art and

35
00:11:34.601 --> 00:11:37.780
continuation of culture and language and various things of that nature.

36
00:11:37.900 --> 00:11:39.790
But it's needless to say,
that photography,

37
00:11:39.791 --> 00:11:44.020
how has allowed us to connect to our past in a way that has not been seen in

38
00:11:44.021 --> 00:11:45.850
history.
So while again,

39
00:11:45.940 --> 00:11:49.750
these original black and whites are valuable in their own right,
adding colors,

40
00:11:49.751 --> 00:11:51.460
and he's older.
Photographs,
in my opinion,

41
00:11:51.461 --> 00:11:54.940
helps to maximize our ability to connect with our human past.

42
00:11:55.090 --> 00:11:57.130
