Hello and welcome to fire of learning.
I'm Justin,

2
00:00:03.121 --> 00:00:05.820
and today I want to talk about dreams.

3
00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:09.270
How do we dream what we dream about?
Why do we dream?

4
00:00:09.271 --> 00:00:14.100
Is there a point of dreaming and so forth?
So to understand dreams,
you have to,

5
00:00:14.101 --> 00:00:16.530
of course,
first understand sleep.

6
00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.250
Sleep in general has always been kind of a mystery to science.

7
00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.060
Why do we need to enter a state that makes us unconscious and paralyzed for

8
00:00:24.061 --> 00:00:26.670
eight hours every night?
If you think about it,

9
00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.310
that's kind of dangerous and sleep is dangerous.

10
00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.030
You could be attacked or eaten or something during sleep out in the wild.

11
00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:35.550
From a Darwinian perspective,
though,

12
00:00:35.551 --> 00:00:38.760
you could infer from the fact that sleep is so common place in the animal

13
00:00:38.761 --> 00:00:41.130
kingdom.
The majority of animals do it.
In fact,

14
00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.750
that it must be crucial for some reason the animals which entered the state,

15
00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.090
which you would expect as a dangerous state out in the wild,

16
00:00:48.091 --> 00:00:52.080
actually end up having some sort of survival advantage over those that did not.

17
00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.520
Research has furthermore shown that sleep is indeed vital to our health.

18
00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.210
It is arguably as important as consuming foods.
So yes,

19
00:01:00.211 --> 00:01:03.510
that awful feeling you get of waking up at six in the morning is completely

20
00:01:03.511 --> 00:01:05.940
justified.
You are in the middle of something important.

21
00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.080
The body and the brain regenerating process a lot in multiple ways during sleep.

22
00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:12.960
The focus of this video is of course on the brain.

23
00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.720
A lack of sleep is not a small issue.

24
00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:19.290
Going for long periods of time without it will eventually lead to very poor

25
00:01:19.291 --> 00:01:20.970
health and eventually or death,

26
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.270
either indirectly or directly death from exhaustion as it's known.

27
00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.680
This only reinforces the fact that all the things that go on during a sleep are

28
00:01:28.681 --> 00:01:31.770
absolutely necessary to your survival and the body.

29
00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:35.700
Scientists are getting a better picture of why sleep evolved.
Muscle grows,

30
00:01:35.701 --> 00:01:36.331
wounds heal,

31
00:01:36.331 --> 00:01:40.320
more hormones get synthesized and a lot of other bodily maintenance takes place.

32
00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.760
The brain during sleep is more of a juggle to understand that when a very major

33
00:01:44.761 --> 00:01:47.010
clue to this puzzle is of course dreaming.

34
00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:51.810
Dreams have fascinated humankind for as long as we have record.

35
00:01:51.811 --> 00:01:53.640
Even going back to ancient Sumeria,

36
00:01:53.641 --> 00:01:56.250
there are clay tablets of people discussing their dreams.

37
00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:59.520
Most cultures have seen them as very relevant,

38
00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:04.170
much more than just random useless night thoughts.
Dreams can be vibrant,
brutal,

39
00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.950
intense,
beautiful,
calming,
terrifying,
utterly nonsensical,

40
00:02:07.951 --> 00:02:12.780
and yet seemingly meaningful.
We experienced situations,
people,
places,

41
00:02:12.781 --> 00:02:15.570
emotions,
events,
et Cetera,
that we are familiar with.

42
00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:17.250
And also ones which we are not.

43
00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:22.050
People across the world have associated dreams with religious or supernatural

44
00:02:22.051 --> 00:02:22.391
beliefs,

45
00:02:22.391 --> 00:02:27.030
stating at their messages from deities or from the deceased or from the soul.

46
00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:31.290
Some believe their images from a past life or visions of the future or things of

47
00:02:31.291 --> 00:02:32.124
that nature.

48
00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:37.050
Scientific Study of dreams called on neurology from the Greek word for dreams on

49
00:02:37.051 --> 00:02:38.160
Narron.
However,

50
00:02:38.161 --> 00:02:42.810
it didn't really take off until the 19th century or so early scientific research

51
00:02:42.811 --> 00:02:47.490
into dreams spearheaded by psychologists such as Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung was

52
00:02:47.491 --> 00:02:50.790
significant in that it turned dreams over to the field of science.

53
00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:54.240
Yet admittedly much of what they and others at the time believed about the

54
00:02:54.241 --> 00:02:59.160
nature and purpose of dreaming was proven to be false.
Though what they believed,

55
00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:02.800
dreaming has formed the backbone of a considerable amount of modern

56
00:03:02.801 --> 00:03:06.760
pseudoscience related to dreaming,
some of which remains commonly believed.

57
00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:11.710
We spend a large amount of our lives dreaming about six years from two hours of

58
00:03:11.711 --> 00:03:15.220
dreaming that we'd do each night.
Contrary to popular belief,

59
00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:18.130
it's very rare to not actually dream every night.

60
00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:20.470
Some people truly just a nut dream.

61
00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:23.860
Others have experienced a form of brain damage,
which prevents it.

62
00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:27.190
But the vast majority of the time we have multiple dreams at night.

63
00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:28.420
We just don't recall them.

64
00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:33.520
About 95% of dream content is a race within 10 minutes of waking up.

65
00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:37.490
If the dream is even profound enough to remember and they usually are not cause

66
00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:41.020
this is because of neurotransmitters involved in forming memories are suppressed

67
00:03:41.021 --> 00:03:43.930
during sleep.
Furthermore,
as you may have noticed,

68
00:03:43.931 --> 00:03:46.810
humans are not the only animals who are believed to dream.

69
00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:50.980
We don't know what other animals like your dog,
cat,
mice,
birds,
et Cetera,

70
00:03:50.981 --> 00:03:54.310
drum about.
There's no real way to tell objectively,

71
00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:57.550
but there's a lot to suggest that they do indeed dream.

72
00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:00.730
Even though dreams can have a profound impact on us,

73
00:04:00.731 --> 00:04:04.630
we might expect science to condemn the imagery and sensations and such things

74
00:04:04.631 --> 00:04:08.140
that occurred during the state when our brains are shut off as useless and

75
00:04:08.141 --> 00:04:10.330
meaningless.
However,
to begin,

76
00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:13.690
it's actually not correct to say that the brain shuts off during sleep.

77
00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:17.610
Obviously people don't mean literally being literally shut off would suggest

78
00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:20.440
brain death,
but even figuratively,
it's incorrect.

79
00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:24.940
The only time your brain is actually shut off is during a coma or a similar

80
00:04:24.941 --> 00:04:27.070
state like being under anesthesia.

81
00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:31.360
Consciousness obviously shuts off different areas of the brain and to rearrest

82
00:04:31.361 --> 00:04:32.050
mode,

83
00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:35.500
but your brain is actually very active during sleep and it actually goes through

84
00:04:35.501 --> 00:04:40.240
several stages of sleep.
Three stages of what is called an rem,

85
00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:45.360
non rem sleep and rem one two and three stage three being also called slow wave

86
00:04:46.271 --> 00:04:50.920
sleep and including the former category of non rem for and rem sleep.

87
00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:53.980
Rem stands for rapid eye movement sleep.

88
00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:57.420
It got this name because if you actually look at a person's eyes during this

89
00:04:57.421 --> 00:04:59.740
stage,
they're typically darting all over the place.

90
00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:03.250
Although if you accidentally wake them up while viewing this condition,

91
00:05:03.251 --> 00:05:06.370
it might be a little bit awkward if the first thing they see is you staring at

92
00:05:06.371 --> 00:05:06.790
them.

93
00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:10.270
I'm sure though that the excuse that it's for science will work out just fine.

94
00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:14.860
These stages were identified in the 1950s and the most interesting stage with

95
00:05:14.861 --> 00:05:16.930
regard to dreams is rem sleep.

96
00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:21.460
The dreams of rems seem to be the most intense animated,
an intriguing,

97
00:05:21.461 --> 00:05:25.000
and therefore the greater portion of scientific study is focused on the dreams

98
00:05:25.001 --> 00:05:27.430
that occur during rem sleep.
We cannot,
however,

99
00:05:27.431 --> 00:05:31.630
leave out the activity in dream content of non runners sleeps specifically stage

100
00:05:31.631 --> 00:05:34.930
three of an rem sleep because it's of course equally important.

101
00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:39.040
You may already have actually recognized the difference between dreams that

102
00:05:39.041 --> 00:05:42.610
occurred during an rem and rem without even knowing it.

103
00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:46.480
Think of the dreams you have during a short nap,

104
00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:50.350
maybe a half hour or so versus those during a full night's sleep.

105
00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:54.700
Usually the story like maybe sometimes realistic dreams that you remember when

106
00:05:54.701 --> 00:05:59.510
you wake up happened during rem sleep as to the more random imagery and mundane

107
00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:03.470
situation in such things that happened and and rem sleep to elaborate,

108
00:06:03.471 --> 00:06:05.450
here's what happens when you fall asleep,

109
00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:09.230
you begin progressively going to the three stages of an rem sleep,

110
00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:13.930
your heart rate,
breathing temperature and all that progressively drop.

111
00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:16.580
It's during this and rem sleep that your body does.

112
00:06:16.581 --> 00:06:18.140
A lot of its repairs and growth.

113
00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:22.730
Dreaming does technically occur in all stages of the first two stages and rem

114
00:06:22.731 --> 00:06:25.700
one and two are different.
In Stage one,

115
00:06:25.701 --> 00:06:29.270
participants in dreaming studies that are awakened and his faith report a mix of

116
00:06:29.271 --> 00:06:34.010
dreaming but also some call it thinking it's a semiconscious relaxed state,

117
00:06:34.011 --> 00:06:37.580
but the dreams are the product of a city brain and are therefore considered a

118
00:06:37.581 --> 00:06:38.510
form of dreaming.

119
00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:42.710
You may also experience what a called hypnic jerks in the stage such as a

120
00:06:42.711 --> 00:06:47.120
falling sensation that's suddenly awakens you or hearing voices or other noises

121
00:06:47.121 --> 00:06:50.450
that are not actually there.
Don't let these things bother you too much.

122
00:06:50.451 --> 00:06:54.740
They'll be sensations are completely normal in an rem to you begin to tune out

123
00:06:54.741 --> 00:06:57.610
the external world.
Dreaming is rare and rum too,

124
00:06:57.620 --> 00:06:59.870
but it is often like those of an rem one.

125
00:06:59.870 --> 00:07:04.310
When dreams occur by an rem three you are in a considerably deep sleep at this

126
00:07:04.311 --> 00:07:08.990
point and it is when the majority of non rem dreams occur around an hour or an

127
00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:11.570
hour and a half into sleep.
Your body enters their rem stage,

128
00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:13.880
your breathing and heart rate and things like that.

129
00:07:13.881 --> 00:07:16.580
Pick back up when you went to rem,
but more interestingly,

130
00:07:16.581 --> 00:07:20.600
your brainwaves are very close to those of your waking state because the

131
00:07:20.601 --> 00:07:23.630
brainwaves are so similar to your waking state.
In fact,

132
00:07:23.631 --> 00:07:26.630
the brain enters what is called rem,
a Tonia.

133
00:07:26.930 --> 00:07:29.960
You probably know this better by the name is given when you consciously

134
00:07:29.961 --> 00:07:31.970
experience it.
Sleep paralysis,

135
00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:35.810
sleep paralysis is very uncomfortable to those who experienced it,

136
00:07:35.811 --> 00:07:39.080
but it is a necessary function.
Without this mechanism,

137
00:07:39.081 --> 00:07:42.110
you would act out your dreams and in fact people with a sleep disorder that

138
00:07:42.111 --> 00:07:45.320
prevents this paralyzed state do sometimes act out their dreams.

139
00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:47.960
It isn't your standard sleepwalking.
Sleep.

140
00:07:47.961 --> 00:07:51.740
Walking usually occurs in stage three of an rem sleep and is believed to have

141
00:07:51.741 --> 00:07:52.700
little to do with dreaming.

142
00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:57.110
It's fairly different from what is called RBD or rapid eye movement,

143
00:07:57.111 --> 00:08:01.520
sleep behavioral disorder where people act out their dreams and talk or eat or

144
00:08:01.521 --> 00:08:02.510
fight,
et cetera.

145
00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:07.130
Both sleepwalking and rem and rem sleep can be dangerous and has even led to

146
00:08:07.131 --> 00:08:09.830
homicides in the past,
which I'll discuss in a future video.

147
00:08:10.010 --> 00:08:13.760
Becoming conscious during Brehm a Tonia and experiencing sleep process,

148
00:08:13.761 --> 00:08:16.100
as I said,
is often pretty wack.

149
00:08:16.130 --> 00:08:18.950
It's when you're kind of awake but still paralyzed in your bed.

150
00:08:19.130 --> 00:08:20.780
Some people such as myself,

151
00:08:20.810 --> 00:08:24.560
notice it becomes somewhat uncomfortable but then usually drift back to sleep.

152
00:08:24.890 --> 00:08:27.140
For others.
It is a terrifying experience.

153
00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:31.430
It's believed to be the source of a lot of alien abduction reports or ghost

154
00:08:31.431 --> 00:08:33.740
interaction reports,
but it's not aliens.

155
00:08:33.740 --> 00:08:38.120
It's just the paralysis from rem sleep is still active or maybe sometimes it's

156
00:08:38.121 --> 00:08:39.140
aliens that Kelly's say,

157
00:08:39.141 --> 00:08:42.860
but we'll look more into sleep disorders and sleep paralysis and lucid dreaming,

158
00:08:42.861 --> 00:08:46.250
which takes place during Rem Sleep and night terrors which should not and all

159
00:08:46.251 --> 00:08:49.010
that sort of thing.
Coming up here back to dreaming itself.

160
00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:54.440
You spend around 10 minutes in this rem sleep stage and then it ends and the

161
00:08:54.440 --> 00:08:56.040
hour and a half sleep cycle.
Then repeat itself.

162
00:08:56.250 --> 00:09:00.600
Rem Sleep typically tends to get longer after each cycle and assuming you get

163
00:09:00.601 --> 00:09:03.600
these suggested eight hours of sleep that I'm sure many of us would like to

164
00:09:03.601 --> 00:09:07.110
actually get.
You'll go through this cycle about four to five times in the night.

165
00:09:07.290 --> 00:09:09.570
The rem stage gets longer after each cycle.

166
00:09:09.571 --> 00:09:13.230
Other side with the last rem period being the longest and fascinatingly,

167
00:09:13.231 --> 00:09:16.710
research seems to suggest that your dreams are the most vibrant,
intense,

168
00:09:16.770 --> 00:09:20.520
and in fact the easiest to recall during this last rem cycle as opposed to your

169
00:09:20.521 --> 00:09:23.700
first rem cycle.
If You keep a dream journal as I do,

170
00:09:23.701 --> 00:09:26.580
it may interest you to record when you record her dreams.

171
00:09:26.670 --> 00:09:29.430
See if they're from the latter halves of your sleep.
Interestingly,

172
00:09:29.431 --> 00:09:30.950
you entered longer periods of end room,

173
00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:34.350
three sleep during the earlier portion of your sleep and gradually have shorter

174
00:09:34.351 --> 00:09:34.980
ones.

175
00:09:34.980 --> 00:09:38.340
However though the end room three periods at the end of the night or shorter,

176
00:09:38.341 --> 00:09:40.410
if you have a dream in the end run three stage,

177
00:09:40.411 --> 00:09:41.910
it's usually toward the end of the night,

178
00:09:42.030 --> 00:09:44.850
which may be related to the increasing intensity of Rem.

179
00:09:45.540 --> 00:09:49.020
There are a number of theories that attempt to explain why dreams occur.

180
00:09:49.350 --> 00:09:53.490
Some state that dreams are a byproduct of important processes in the brain,

181
00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:56.760
but others say that dreams themselves are important for the more.

182
00:09:56.761 --> 00:10:00.570
This question becomes even more complex as we have different types of dreams in

183
00:10:00.571 --> 00:10:04.050
dreams.
In different stages of sleep to understand them.

184
00:10:04.051 --> 00:10:05.400
We have to look at a source.

185
00:10:05.910 --> 00:10:08.880
Dreams do not originate from just one part of the brain.

186
00:10:09.030 --> 00:10:11.070
Several parts of the brain contribute.
However,

187
00:10:11.071 --> 00:10:14.520
there was a big emphasis on the brain parts involved in various kinds of

188
00:10:14.521 --> 00:10:16.890
memories like your hippocampus and cerebellum.

189
00:10:17.220 --> 00:10:21.670
Sleep in general is considered by may scientists to be very important in what is

190
00:10:21.671 --> 00:10:23.340
called memory consolidation.

191
00:10:23.490 --> 00:10:26.820
You brain reviews information is gathered throughout the day and sorts it.

192
00:10:26.970 --> 00:10:31.110
It strengthens information to finds useful but it tends to delete information

193
00:10:31.111 --> 00:10:33.780
that I consider is unnecessary.
For example,

194
00:10:33.870 --> 00:10:37.590
your brain may run through the routes you take to get to your classes at school

195
00:10:37.591 --> 00:10:39.750
over and over during a sleep.
However,

196
00:10:39.810 --> 00:10:43.500
other information like the color of the shirt to professor is wearing on the

197
00:10:43.501 --> 00:10:45.460
first day may get deleted.

198
00:10:46.170 --> 00:10:50.370
This footage from experiments undertaken by Matt Wilson shown at the world

199
00:10:50.371 --> 00:10:53.880
science festival shows a video of a rat moving through a maze,

200
00:10:54.330 --> 00:10:58.320
but dots you see on the maze and to the left are displays of the brain cells

201
00:10:58.321 --> 00:11:00.930
that fire when the mouse reaches that specific area.

202
00:11:01.380 --> 00:11:05.490
Wilson and other researchers then sent them mouse through the maze a second time

203
00:11:05.730 --> 00:11:09.600
and the computer attempted to predict where the mouse was based off the brain

204
00:11:09.601 --> 00:11:11.520
cells that at red roof firing alone.

205
00:11:12.300 --> 00:11:16.650
Now typically impressively the Blue Arrow matches up with where the mouse is,

206
00:11:16.770 --> 00:11:18.420
but occasionally as you can see,

207
00:11:18.421 --> 00:11:22.170
the mouse will stop and an Arrow of flash behind it or ahead of it's showing

208
00:11:22.171 --> 00:11:25.440
that the mouse is thinking about going through the entire maze as a whole,

209
00:11:25.590 --> 00:11:29.550
forming a mental picture of the whole thing.
The third video,
however,

210
00:11:29.570 --> 00:11:31.530
is the most interesting one here.

211
00:11:31.531 --> 00:11:35.340
Researchers are monitoring the rat's brain as it's sleeping and finding that the

212
00:11:35.341 --> 00:11:39.060
brain cells specifically involved in running through the maze are firing over

213
00:11:39.061 --> 00:11:42.360
and over again very quickly.
It runs through the maze route mentally,

214
00:11:42.361 --> 00:11:45.480
sometimes even backwards to strengthen the memory of the route.

215
00:11:45.780 --> 00:11:48.240
There is of course more than just observation.

216
00:11:48.630 --> 00:11:51.900
Studies have shown that interrupting sleep can affect performance on things like

217
00:11:51.901 --> 00:11:54.310
memory,
examinations of all kinds.
However,

218
00:11:54.580 --> 00:11:58.330
specific types of memories are believed to be related to specific stages of

219
00:11:58.331 --> 00:12:00.520
sleep.
This can be kind of confusing,

220
00:12:00.521 --> 00:12:04.600
but I'll try to elaborate and rem three seems to be closely related to

221
00:12:04.601 --> 00:12:08.800
consolidating what is called declarative memory.
This has to do with facts,

222
00:12:08.801 --> 00:12:12.460
information,
experiences in such things learned throughout the day consciously.

223
00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:14.590
Likewise on scientific tests,

224
00:12:14.591 --> 00:12:18.460
people who are deprived of an rem sleep sleep seem to do worse on tests

225
00:12:18.461 --> 00:12:22.540
involving recalling information and memorization and things like that than those

226
00:12:22.541 --> 00:12:25.450
who are allowed it.
If you're learning to play an instrument,

227
00:12:25.540 --> 00:12:29.590
your brain may run through the experiences of that lesson at night.
However,

228
00:12:29.890 --> 00:12:33.580
the specific procedural memory of playing that instrument is reviewed during rem

229
00:12:33.581 --> 00:12:37.600
sleep.
Again,
where your body's paralyzed,
who eventually from reenacting things,

230
00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:41.680
the actual steps,
the muscle memory,
the unconscious details,

231
00:12:41.681 --> 00:12:44.530
et Cetera to play the instrument are viewed here.

232
00:12:44.890 --> 00:12:49.060
Studies again show that shorten apps seem to have no effect on the performance

233
00:12:49.061 --> 00:12:53.050
of certain tasks like riding a bike or playing an instrument.
However,

234
00:12:53.080 --> 00:12:57.130
after a few periods of rem sleep,
there is a noted improvement.
Furthermore,

235
00:12:57.160 --> 00:13:00.880
other parts of the brain involved in emotion such as the Amygdala and other

236
00:13:00.881 --> 00:13:04.330
parts involved with memory and other areas of the limbic system are activated

237
00:13:04.331 --> 00:13:05.620
more in Rem sleep as well.

238
00:13:05.890 --> 00:13:09.730
This actually seems to be very relevant in reports of dream content.

239
00:13:10.030 --> 00:13:14.830
Dreams from an rem three are very often related to waking life aspects of your

240
00:13:14.831 --> 00:13:17.410
life that are currently affecting you and things of that nature.

241
00:13:17.710 --> 00:13:19.480
If you're learning Italian,
for example,

242
00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:24.400
you may dream about Italy speaking Italian being there walking by the leaning

243
00:13:24.401 --> 00:13:28.090
tower of Pisa,
viewing the art of Italy,
eating the food of Italy,
et Cetera,

244
00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:29.800
all while in and rem three.

245
00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:34.870
These dreams while interesting are not usually very vibrant or emotionally

246
00:13:34.871 --> 00:13:37.270
captivating and are much less memorable,

247
00:13:37.271 --> 00:13:41.470
often described compared to rem dreams as a mundane procedural memory,

248
00:13:41.530 --> 00:13:45.640
often called implicit memory refers to the unconscious information obtained

249
00:13:45.641 --> 00:13:49.030
throughout the day and this is the information which is consolidated and rem,

250
00:13:49.180 --> 00:13:53.320
but also keep in mind emotional consolidation occurs during rem as well and a

251
00:13:53.321 --> 00:13:54.940
rem dream after the same day.

252
00:13:54.941 --> 00:13:59.590
You may find yourself as a Roman general being elected a new pope or flying in a

253
00:13:59.591 --> 00:14:01.810
contraption made by Leonardo Da Vinci.

254
00:14:01.990 --> 00:14:06.490
This may not really even feature much of the Italian or the aspects of Italy

255
00:14:06.520 --> 00:14:10.240
that you've learned about early in the day.
It may go completely off course.

256
00:14:10.690 --> 00:14:15.150
It's worth mentioning also that infant's spend much more time about 50% of the

257
00:14:15.151 --> 00:14:16.450
sleep and rem sleep.

258
00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:20.500
It's held that baby's sip a considerable amount of time in general because their

259
00:14:20.501 --> 00:14:21.430
body is growing.

260
00:14:21.850 --> 00:14:25.600
It's entirely plausible that they enter rem sleep so frequently because of

261
00:14:25.601 --> 00:14:28.930
neurostimulation from rem sleep is growing their brains and some passion.

262
00:14:29.530 --> 00:14:32.980
Some theories hold that while your brain is organizing memories and going

263
00:14:32.981 --> 00:14:34.600
through information you've learned throughout the day.

264
00:14:34.690 --> 00:14:37.870
It's sending out signals that the rest of your brain is reading.

265
00:14:38.560 --> 00:14:42.430
Different parts of your brain are activated,
memory centers,
emotional centers,

266
00:14:42.431 --> 00:14:43.264
things like that,

267
00:14:43.450 --> 00:14:47.350
and it creates a dream from these signals to make sense of them.
Furthermore,

268
00:14:47.380 --> 00:14:52.100
supporting this theory is the fact that external stimuli sounds sensations and

269
00:14:52.101 --> 00:14:56.270
the real world like a dog barking outside of foul smell in the room or fitting

270
00:14:56.271 --> 00:14:57.050
hot.

271
00:14:57.050 --> 00:15:01.220
Haven't noted affect on dream content though the external world can affect our

272
00:15:01.221 --> 00:15:04.430
dreams.
Dreaming is indeed something which occurred internally,

273
00:15:04.730 --> 00:15:07.610
not from external stimuli.
During all of this,

274
00:15:07.700 --> 00:15:11.750
your prefrontal cortex and what's referred to as the left brain that have to

275
00:15:11.751 --> 00:15:15.410
deal with planning and critical thinking and logic and things like that are

276
00:15:15.411 --> 00:15:16.400
pretty inactive.

277
00:15:16.550 --> 00:15:19.670
These brain structures aren't there to cross check information and it must

278
00:15:19.671 --> 00:15:23.240
referred to more as the right brain has a wider range,

279
00:15:23.390 --> 00:15:28.070
so a giant three had duck or snoop Dogg as a Jedi.
Knight is fair game.

280
00:15:28.850 --> 00:15:32.510
The dominance of the right brain and dreaming can be shown not only from the

281
00:15:32.511 --> 00:15:35.330
lack of logical patterns in the chaotic nature of dreams,

282
00:15:35.690 --> 00:15:40.690
but less emphasis on reading actual words in such things for the more the areas

283
00:15:40.881 --> 00:15:44.810
involved with certain parts of self awareness or also turned off being of course

284
00:15:44.811 --> 00:15:46.460
unnecessary as well in the state,

285
00:15:46.550 --> 00:15:50.480
meaning you're not easily able to tell that you are in a dream or an unusual

286
00:15:50.481 --> 00:15:51.314
reality.

287
00:15:51.830 --> 00:15:55.310
Individuals who have suffered brain damage to the area involved with his self

288
00:15:55.311 --> 00:15:59.570
awareness may notably have trouble distinguishing between dreams and waking
life.

289
00:16:00.380 --> 00:16:04.280
The similarity between the waking brain and the rem brain may also contribute to

290
00:16:04.281 --> 00:16:07.010
why you feel conscious in your dreams.
In a sense,

291
00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:09.920
you are conscious just in an altered state of consciousness.

292
00:16:09.921 --> 00:16:12.410
Most notably without logic or self awareness,

293
00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:17.180
which makes dreams seem even more mysterious and cool though or dream content is

294
00:16:17.181 --> 00:16:20.660
often nonsensical.
The emotions we feel in dreams or not,

295
00:16:21.260 --> 00:16:25.820
it's been suggested that the driving force of dreams are our emotions and the

296
00:16:25.821 --> 00:16:27.640
things we dream of our responses.

297
00:16:27.650 --> 00:16:30.980
It does emotions rather than emotions being responses to what we dream of.

298
00:16:31.580 --> 00:16:35.510
Basically series that revolve around this information hold.

299
00:16:35.511 --> 00:16:38.330
A dreaming itself doesn't have a specific function.

300
00:16:38.450 --> 00:16:42.380
It's a byproduct of another specific function called an epic phenomenon.

301
00:16:42.620 --> 00:16:43.311
That process,

302
00:16:43.311 --> 00:16:47.780
again being the various forms of memory consolidation that activate other parts

303
00:16:47.781 --> 00:16:48.620
of brands.
Well,

304
00:16:49.280 --> 00:16:52.880
considering the differences of the memory consolidation processes and

305
00:16:52.881 --> 00:16:56.720
understanding that in rem sleep areas of the brain involved in procedural
memory,

306
00:16:56.721 --> 00:17:00.560
emotional memory as well as creativity and abstract thinking are activated.

307
00:17:00.650 --> 00:17:01.071
In fact,

308
00:17:01.071 --> 00:17:04.910
some areas like the hippocampus and Amygdala are even more active in Rem sleep

309
00:17:04.911 --> 00:17:07.380
and during wakefulness.
It's no surprise.

310
00:17:07.410 --> 00:17:11.630
The dreams report during rem sleep are often much more profound and memorable

311
00:17:11.631 --> 00:17:15.740
and colorful while and rem three dreams which tend to review snapshots of

312
00:17:15.741 --> 00:17:18.620
information throughout the day are more relevant to daily life,

313
00:17:18.680 --> 00:17:22.580
but less interesting stuff though the rem brain is the most similar to the

314
00:17:22.581 --> 00:17:23.870
waking brain in general.

315
00:17:24.080 --> 00:17:27.590
The brain activity and and rum three's a little bit more like wakeful thinking

316
00:17:27.620 --> 00:17:31.400
while the brain activity and rem is a little bit more chaotic and disorganized.

317
00:17:32.030 --> 00:17:36.350
That mouse we mentioned earlier was probably in an rem three reviewing the maze

318
00:17:36.351 --> 00:17:38.540
over and over again in a fast process.

319
00:17:38.750 --> 00:17:42.140
In Rem sleep memories are played out as if they were actually occurring in real

320
00:17:42.141 --> 00:17:44.930
time.
Is that truly the end of the story though?

321
00:17:45.110 --> 00:17:49.530
But dreams are the interesting yet essentially useless byproducts of your doing

322
00:17:49.531 --> 00:17:53.520
a recap of your day.
There are of course other theories.

323
00:17:53.940 --> 00:17:57.390
Rem Sleep not only aids in the performance,
certain tasks,

324
00:17:57.450 --> 00:18:00.870
but also some studies seem to suggest that it helps with creativity.

325
00:18:01.290 --> 00:18:03.150
Could dreaming play a role in this.

326
00:18:03.390 --> 00:18:07.530
Some postulate that perhaps dreaming as a part of the brain's attempt to take

327
00:18:07.531 --> 00:18:11.400
the information is sorting through during a sleep and connected to and compare

328
00:18:11.401 --> 00:18:13.830
it with other memories and information in the brain.

329
00:18:14.460 --> 00:18:18.390
Some add onto this that with the prefrontal cortex being offline,

330
00:18:18.450 --> 00:18:22.710
there is a wider opportunity for creativity to run free and random association

331
00:18:22.711 --> 00:18:25.530
has to be made which could have evolved to help in waking life.

332
00:18:26.190 --> 00:18:29.760
Many people through history have attributed inventions,
ideas,

333
00:18:29.761 --> 00:18:34.230
works of art and other epiphany's and creations to having come from dreams.

334
00:18:34.860 --> 00:18:36.780
Granted,
we have to keep in mind however,

335
00:18:36.781 --> 00:18:40.650
that these people were quite frequently already toying with the concepts that

336
00:18:40.651 --> 00:18:43.890
they'd eventually contribute to and would have continued to regardless of the

337
00:18:43.891 --> 00:18:44.550
dreams,

338
00:18:44.550 --> 00:18:48.480
but it's worth considering the possible inspiration that may have come from them

339
00:18:48.540 --> 00:18:51.750
and the potential creativity boosts Debbie get from dreaming that may greatly

340
00:18:51.751 --> 00:18:56.730
influence our waking lives or as some hold have helped our ancestors survive.

341
00:18:57.030 --> 00:19:01.380
We must also keep in mind however that while rem sleep can be shown to influence

342
00:19:01.381 --> 00:19:01.981
creativity,

343
00:19:01.981 --> 00:19:06.540
dreams may again just be the byproduct of this process and not actually

344
00:19:06.541 --> 00:19:09.420
definitely a part of the creativity boosts that we get from rem.

345
00:19:10.410 --> 00:19:14.400
Yet some theories do hold that dreaming itself is inherently useful to our

346
00:19:14.401 --> 00:19:15.990
survival and may have evolved.

347
00:19:15.991 --> 00:19:20.910
Specifically the basis of these theories revolves around what we do.
Move out.

348
00:19:21.600 --> 00:19:24.630
I'll go over specific dream content statistics in a moment,

349
00:19:24.631 --> 00:19:28.380
but for now it will suffice to say that a substantial portion of our dreams,

350
00:19:28.381 --> 00:19:31.590
especially in childhood are on average very negative.

351
00:19:31.800 --> 00:19:36.800
Why it's theorized that dreams have evolved as a kind of simulation to practice

352
00:19:36.991 --> 00:19:37.824
for the real world.

353
00:19:38.130 --> 00:19:41.670
These negative dreams are very often related to the negative things in our

354
00:19:41.671 --> 00:19:42.504
waking life.

355
00:19:43.020 --> 00:19:46.860
Children may dream of monsters and being lost and losing their parents and the

356
00:19:46.861 --> 00:19:50.760
fears that we would expect children to have adults stream about accidents,

357
00:19:50.790 --> 00:19:53.940
failures at work,
divorce and breakups and things like that.

358
00:19:54.330 --> 00:19:59.330
This may have evolved as a way to run through things to get a feel for them

359
00:19:59.761 --> 00:20:02.040
before you actually have to go out and face them.

360
00:20:02.430 --> 00:20:05.280
Dreaming About Encountering Wolves or bears,

361
00:20:05.281 --> 00:20:08.880
it's such things may have helped our ancestors deal with the situations when

362
00:20:08.881 --> 00:20:09.714
they arose,

363
00:20:09.870 --> 00:20:14.070
thus helping their survival thus meaning dreaming itself is evolutionarily

364
00:20:14.071 --> 00:20:16.260
advantageous.
Perhaps even today.

365
00:20:16.261 --> 00:20:19.680
Those dreams about this speech you have to give or the arguments with their

366
00:20:19.681 --> 00:20:22.890
coworkers may help you handle those situations in the real world as well.

367
00:20:23.430 --> 00:20:24.540
However,
again,

368
00:20:24.541 --> 00:20:28.200
it's worth reiterating that with the logical and supper where parts of your

369
00:20:28.201 --> 00:20:30.930
brain being off these things may not always make sense.

370
00:20:31.140 --> 00:20:35.040
You may dream of your father dying when your father is perfectly healthy or

371
00:20:35.041 --> 00:20:38.880
getting fired when you're an excellent employee and certainly you may dream

372
00:20:38.881 --> 00:20:41.640
about being haunted by ghosts even when you dump and even them.

373
00:20:41.940 --> 00:20:43.740
If this theory is valid,

374
00:20:43.770 --> 00:20:46.530
the brain would just be running through uncomfortable things,

375
00:20:46.900 --> 00:20:50.140
not necessarily assessing the likelihood of them occurring.

376
00:20:50.200 --> 00:20:54.130
This theory is supported by the finding that people undergoing stresses in life

377
00:20:54.131 --> 00:20:56.980
may dream more option than otherwise content people.

378
00:20:57.610 --> 00:21:00.190
Many explanations have been offered as to why we dream,

379
00:21:00.191 --> 00:21:04.750
but these are the most likely and consistent with science regardless of whether

380
00:21:04.751 --> 00:21:08.470
or not dreams evolved for a reason or are a byproduct,
but processes,

381
00:21:08.471 --> 00:21:12.190
which of all for a reason we can not deny that dreams have is sort of relevance

382
00:21:12.191 --> 00:21:15.970
to us in our waking lives and that there is a potential to peer into them and

383
00:21:15.971 --> 00:21:16.804
learn from them.

384
00:21:17.290 --> 00:21:21.910
Since we dream about things relevant to our lives and the states of mind and

385
00:21:21.911 --> 00:21:26.410
experiences we have effect or dreaming does what we dream about reflect who we

386
00:21:26.411 --> 00:21:27.820
are and where lives are.

387
00:21:28.540 --> 00:21:32.950
Let's talk now not just about dreaming from the outside but the inside what

388
00:21:32.951 --> 00:21:35.050
we're dreaming about.
As mentioned,

389
00:21:35.110 --> 00:21:38.020
the majority of our dreams across the world are negative,

390
00:21:38.620 --> 00:21:41.470
negative life circumstances and mental illnesses.

391
00:21:41.471 --> 00:21:44.920
In such things tend to cause more negative dreams while higher satisfaction with

392
00:21:44.921 --> 00:21:47.500
life seems to correlate with fewer negative dreams.

393
00:21:47.890 --> 00:21:52.810
Both participants in studies as well as researchers stress a difference between

394
00:21:52.811 --> 00:21:54.880
a negative dream and the nightmare.

395
00:21:55.780 --> 00:21:58.510
Negative dreams are commonplace considerably.

396
00:21:58.511 --> 00:22:02.470
Disquieting or uncomfortable dreams.
Nightmares are less commonplace.

397
00:22:03.100 --> 00:22:06.970
Studies that are taken by Ernest Hartman seem to suggest that people who suffer

398
00:22:06.971 --> 00:22:10.150
from mental illness,
unhealthy social life,
excessive stress,

399
00:22:10.151 --> 00:22:14.290
and even individuals who attempt suicide have higher rates of nightmares than

400
00:22:14.291 --> 00:22:18.700
the average men feel aggression in dreams much more commonly than women do and

401
00:22:18.701 --> 00:22:21.280
dream about other men more commonly than women do.

402
00:22:21.370 --> 00:22:24.390
Women tend to have more dreams involving people they know in places that are

403
00:22:24.391 --> 00:22:28.070
familiar with and typically have more characters in the dreams.
All together,

404
00:22:28.240 --> 00:22:31.990
both teenagers and the elderly seem to have similar dreams.
However,

405
00:22:32.290 --> 00:22:35.650
the elderly report fewer dreams involving aggression and negative emotions.

406
00:22:35.651 --> 00:22:36.370
In general,

407
00:22:36.370 --> 00:22:40.660
research also seems to suggest that we have an easier time recalling her dreams

408
00:22:40.661 --> 00:22:44.350
as we age,
even though children who spend more time in rem sleep and adults,

409
00:22:44.560 --> 00:22:47.230
I thought to dream more in three fourths of our dreams,

410
00:22:47.231 --> 00:22:50.320
there is at least some consideration given to how other characters and our

411
00:22:50.321 --> 00:22:51.490
dreams feel about us.

412
00:22:51.910 --> 00:22:56.910
We tend to only dream of essentially exact replays of our waking lives 1.4% of

413
00:22:57.641 --> 00:22:59.800
the time.
According to some studies,
however,

414
00:22:59.801 --> 00:23:04.300
65% of our dreams have they considered relevant to an individual's life by

415
00:23:04.301 --> 00:23:05.950
reporting study participants.

416
00:23:06.580 --> 00:23:09.850
This means that we dream of things related to our waking concerns,

417
00:23:09.851 --> 00:23:14.140
but not as much our waking concerned and exactness.
Basically,

418
00:23:14.230 --> 00:23:15.580
if you're learning guitar,

419
00:23:15.581 --> 00:23:19.240
you're much more likely to dream of yourself playing in a band on stage.

420
00:23:19.340 --> 00:23:22.330
Then going through the steps of learning a song to learn that day.

421
00:23:22.390 --> 00:23:26.470
This is believed to be related to how the brain processes memory during sleep.

422
00:23:26.920 --> 00:23:30.460
We are also present in the vast majority of our dreams and generally are on

423
00:23:30.461 --> 00:23:32.410
surprisingly the main characters.

424
00:23:32.710 --> 00:23:36.970
Sexual content is much less common in our dreams and we might expect only about

425
00:23:36.971 --> 00:23:40.030
10% of dreams features sexual content on average,

426
00:23:40.090 --> 00:23:42.430
and this is most common in adolescence.

427
00:23:42.610 --> 00:23:47.310
Sexual Dreams May at times result in what is called a nocturnal emission or a

428
00:23:47.311 --> 00:23:50.390
wet dream,
which is an orgasm that occurs during sleep.

429
00:23:51.110 --> 00:23:53.570
Men tend to dream about sex more often than women,

430
00:23:53.660 --> 00:23:57.980
but neither men nor women seem to even usually dream about their partners in sex

431
00:23:57.981 --> 00:23:58.814
dreams.

432
00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:03.350
Women only have dreams involving current or past partners in 20% of their sex

433
00:24:03.351 --> 00:24:06.110
dreams.
Men only 14% of the time,

434
00:24:06.350 --> 00:24:09.200
men have higher tendencies of dreaming of multiple partners,

435
00:24:09.230 --> 00:24:10.760
women of celebrities.

436
00:24:11.180 --> 00:24:15.350
Evidently 12% of our dreams occur in black and white.
However,

437
00:24:15.470 --> 00:24:18.920
this is a much lower statistic than from earlier decades,
and in fact,

438
00:24:18.921 --> 00:24:23.921
only 4.4% of people under the age of 25 report dreams in black and white today.

439
00:24:24.290 --> 00:24:27.350
This is likely linked to the development of color television.

440
00:24:27.770 --> 00:24:30.710
Individuals who had been blind from birth also report dreaming.

441
00:24:30.711 --> 00:24:34.850
So naturally they did not dream of visual content.
Not surprisingly,

442
00:24:34.880 --> 00:24:39.500
not only do we tend to have similar emotions and general events occur across the

443
00:24:39.501 --> 00:24:44.090
world and our dreams,
but we also dream of similar specific situations.

444
00:24:44.510 --> 00:24:48.890
Being chased seems to be one of the most common types of dreams along with being

445
00:24:48.891 --> 00:24:52.400
nude in public,
being excessively late to something very important,

446
00:24:52.401 --> 00:24:55.610
such as an exam because of obstacles or being lost,

447
00:24:55.670 --> 00:24:59.930
discovering new rooms or new aspects about a familiar environment being

448
00:24:59.931 --> 00:25:02.280
destroyed by an unstoppable disasters.

449
00:25:02.281 --> 00:25:06.500
How does a tidal wave or the end of the world and both the deceased being alive

450
00:25:06.501 --> 00:25:09.500
and dreams as well as living,
dying and dreams?

451
00:25:09.800 --> 00:25:12.230
It's not uncommon for dreams to be repetitive.

452
00:25:12.560 --> 00:25:17.210
Around 67% of adults report having experienced them at least once in their
lives.

453
00:25:17.390 --> 00:25:21.740
Perhaps you may throughout the course of a few days or even weeks or more have

454
00:25:21.741 --> 00:25:26.240
very similar or repetitive dreams or at least dreams involving similar motions,

455
00:25:26.250 --> 00:25:27.770
events and sensations.

456
00:25:27.920 --> 00:25:31.490
Many of these repetitive dreams involved the themes that I just mentioned and

457
00:25:31.491 --> 00:25:33.860
are usually negative on.
Surprisingly,

458
00:25:33.890 --> 00:25:36.170
if you dream about the same things repeatedly,

459
00:25:36.440 --> 00:25:39.500
these subjects are often occupying your waking of mine as well.

460
00:25:40.250 --> 00:25:44.330
Dreaming of trouble at school,
missing classrooms,
spending tests,
et Cetera,

461
00:25:44.690 --> 00:25:48.110
is often linked to actual stress over some aspect of school.

462
00:25:48.440 --> 00:25:52.340
Dreaming of being overwhelmed by a great force like a tidal wave may be

463
00:25:52.341 --> 00:25:55.280
indicative of being overwhelmed by something in waking life.

464
00:25:55.430 --> 00:25:59.270
Dreaming of a deceased friend or family member may indicate that their law still

465
00:25:59.271 --> 00:26:00.980
has a significant impact on you.

466
00:26:01.160 --> 00:26:05.900
Statistics like these simply reinforced the notion that dreams are a window into

467
00:26:05.901 --> 00:26:07.220
different parts of our mind.

468
00:26:07.610 --> 00:26:11.750
We can use statistics like these with regard to the psychology of people on the

469
00:26:11.751 --> 00:26:12.650
macro scale,

470
00:26:12.950 --> 00:26:16.580
but you are able to do the same perhaps in even greater detail on your own by

471
00:26:16.581 --> 00:26:18.080
keeping a dream journal.

472
00:26:18.620 --> 00:26:22.700
I keep a dream journal for these reasons and that isn't just about recording

473
00:26:22.701 --> 00:26:25.880
dreams.
A large part is analyzing the content.

474
00:26:26.300 --> 00:26:29.720
Recording dreams as soon as you wake up is crucial because again,

475
00:26:29.810 --> 00:26:33.620
you forget huge chunks of your dreams within 10 minutes of waking up.
Generally,

476
00:26:33.621 --> 00:26:34.880
I don't actually write it out.

477
00:26:34.881 --> 00:26:38.240
I usually just make notes that refer back to specific details and then go back

478
00:26:38.241 --> 00:26:41.720
to bed.
Then later write it out in detail.
From there.

479
00:26:41.721 --> 00:26:45.750
I will then analyze her aspects.
Look for the people and your dream,

480
00:26:45.930 --> 00:26:49.260
their relation to you,
how you feel about them,
what they're doing,
et cetera.

481
00:26:49.470 --> 00:26:53.940
Look at your environment.
Do you dream often and work school,
your parent's house.

482
00:26:54.090 --> 00:26:58.200
What emotions have you felt in a dream?
Anger,
anxiousness,
happiness?

483
00:26:58.410 --> 00:27:02.640
Does it start off negative,
but then you find a sense of comfort.
Finally,

484
00:27:02.670 --> 00:27:04.290
highlight specific themes.

485
00:27:04.410 --> 00:27:07.260
If one dream you dream of an argument with your parents,

486
00:27:07.290 --> 00:27:11.670
another dream of yourself in a war and in another dream you find yourself in a

487
00:27:11.671 --> 00:27:12.504
fight at school.

488
00:27:12.870 --> 00:27:17.370
This was suggest that you regularly dream of conflict after multiple dreams,

489
00:27:17.460 --> 00:27:21.930
probably at least 30 begin tallying up your statistics and analyze them.

490
00:27:22.020 --> 00:27:23.910
Compare them to population averages.

491
00:27:23.911 --> 00:27:26.910
See what you're doing about and what these dreams may mean.

492
00:27:27.060 --> 00:27:30.840
The master of dream according was a man named Kalvin s hall.

493
00:27:30.960 --> 00:27:34.980
He collected more than 50,000 dreams from people in scientific studies

494
00:27:34.981 --> 00:27:38.550
throughout his life and developed a way to analyze them.
Also note,

495
00:27:38.580 --> 00:27:43.580
I do mean to be careful using the word mean religious or spiritual leafs that

496
00:27:44.311 --> 00:27:48.720
dreams carry inherent meaning will not be disrespected in this video.
However,

497
00:27:48.721 --> 00:27:51.840
they will not be covered in detail here.
Scientifically speaking,

498
00:27:51.841 --> 00:27:56.841
things such as prophetic dreams or a metaphorical dreams are not typically held

499
00:27:57.121 --> 00:28:01.920
in high regard.
If you dream of an ambulance passing the street,
for example,

500
00:28:02.310 --> 00:28:06.270
you may wonder if this is your subconscious attempting to send you a message.

501
00:28:06.600 --> 00:28:09.060
When your friend asks for help through a difficult time,

502
00:28:09.061 --> 00:28:12.260
you may believe that this is what the dream was indeed referring to the

503
00:28:12.270 --> 00:28:15.720
subconscious realization that your friend would need help.
However,

504
00:28:15.721 --> 00:28:19.170
if you were to break your arm that week,
if your grandmother were to pass away,

505
00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:20.940
if you were to need a bandaid on a wound,

506
00:28:20.941 --> 00:28:23.370
if you had to ask your coworkers for help for something at work,

507
00:28:23.400 --> 00:28:25.380
if you were to donate to charity,
et Cetera,

508
00:28:25.680 --> 00:28:29.490
you could say that any of these events are what the ambulance was predicting.

509
00:28:29.940 --> 00:28:30.750
Meanwhile,

510
00:28:30.750 --> 00:28:33.810
the other dreams you've had this week are ignored when they point to nothing.

511
00:28:34.470 --> 00:28:38.070
It's for this reason which has been observed in various forums and scientific

512
00:28:38.071 --> 00:28:43.071
studies that scientist are distrustful of prophetic or metaphorical dreams.

513
00:28:43.860 --> 00:28:47.580
The mind may indeed symbolize things in dreams,
metaphorically.
However,

514
00:28:47.581 --> 00:28:48.331
it's very lucky,

515
00:28:48.331 --> 00:28:53.130
less of a subconscious attempt to send a complex message as a conscious mind,

516
00:28:53.610 --> 00:28:56.640
but more reflection of what is going on in your mind altogether.

517
00:28:57.570 --> 00:29:01.500
Because the logical planning decision making parts of our brain are off during

518
00:29:01.501 --> 00:29:01.831
sleep.

519
00:29:01.831 --> 00:29:06.270
We typically feel more like a character in our dreams and ourselves even when

520
00:29:06.271 --> 00:29:09.300
they occur in the first person.
Some people,
however,

521
00:29:09.301 --> 00:29:13.800
are able to exercise a degree of awareness in our dreams and maybe even take

522
00:29:13.801 --> 00:29:18.120
control of her parts of the dream content and the direction that dream takes.

523
00:29:18.720 --> 00:29:21.600
This is known commonly as lucid dreaming.

524
00:29:21.990 --> 00:29:24.450
Lucid dreaming may sound like pseudoscience,

525
00:29:24.451 --> 00:29:26.640
but there is actually scientific backing for some of it.

526
00:29:27.480 --> 00:29:30.330
The concept of lucid dreaming dates back to the ancient Greeks,

527
00:29:30.331 --> 00:29:33.090
but modern understanding of it began in the 19th century.

528
00:29:33.510 --> 00:29:36.480
In 1867 the marquee doc feed the soul.

529
00:29:36.490 --> 00:29:41.490
Denny published the book [inaudible] [inaudible] critique dreams and the ways to

530
00:29:43.430 --> 00:29:46.450
direct them.
Practical observations.
In this book.

531
00:29:46.451 --> 00:29:49.270
He not only discusses his experiences with lucid dreaming,

532
00:29:49.630 --> 00:29:53.200
but also instructs readers on how they may learn to do it themselves.

533
00:29:53.770 --> 00:29:57.970
In 1913 the term lucid dreaming was coined by Friedrich von Aden,

534
00:29:58.060 --> 00:30:02.410
a Dutch psychiatrist.
I have personally never had a lucid dream.

535
00:30:02.411 --> 00:30:05.770
I have had dreams in which I realized within the dream that I was dreaming,

536
00:30:06.250 --> 00:30:09.400
but there was a certain criteria that you have to meet before a dream is

537
00:30:09.401 --> 00:30:11.350
considered a lucid dream.
Paul,

538
00:30:11.500 --> 00:30:16.120
totally a German psychologist has laid out seven conditions which must be met

539
00:30:16.150 --> 00:30:18.640
before you're dreaming is considered lucid dreaming.

540
00:30:19.240 --> 00:30:24.240
One awareness of the dream state to awareness of the capacity to make decisions.

541
00:30:25.210 --> 00:30:29.230
Three awareness of memory functions for awareness of self.

542
00:30:29.590 --> 00:30:32.020
Five,
awareness of the dream environment.

543
00:30:32.050 --> 00:30:37.050
Six awareness of the meaning of the dream and seven awareness of concentration

544
00:30:37.271 --> 00:30:38.140
and focus.

545
00:30:38.710 --> 00:30:42.940
The basic concept of lucid dreaming being in a form of a conscious state while

546
00:30:42.941 --> 00:30:44.980
dreaming has been confirmed by science.

547
00:30:45.130 --> 00:30:48.070
Lucid dreams are the most common in the final stages of rem,

548
00:30:48.071 --> 00:30:51.370
wherein of course we have the most vivid and detailed dreams.

549
00:30:51.850 --> 00:30:53.800
Researchers such as Steven Laberge,

550
00:30:53.860 --> 00:30:57.790
the founder of the Lucidity Institute have designed experiments in which study

551
00:30:57.791 --> 00:31:01.390
participants were given a prearranged signal to move their eyes.

552
00:31:01.391 --> 00:31:02.830
When they were aware they were dreaming.

553
00:31:03.070 --> 00:31:06.550
The study found that may participants were once they entered from sleep,

554
00:31:06.551 --> 00:31:11.551
indeed giving the prearranged signal they were even able to count out 10 seconds

555
00:31:11.561 --> 00:31:14.680
by moving their eyes in a specific way,
waiting 10 seconds,

556
00:31:15.010 --> 00:31:16.420
then given the signal again,

557
00:31:16.480 --> 00:31:20.260
which demonstrates to the passage of time and dreams is the same as in waking

558
00:31:20.261 --> 00:31:21.940
life,
at least in rem dreams.

559
00:31:22.150 --> 00:31:26.140
Lucid dreaming is described as somewhat precarious for beginners.

560
00:31:26.680 --> 00:31:30.690
It relies on finding a balance between consciousness and dreaming in which there

561
00:31:30.691 --> 00:31:34.320
is a tendency to either wake up or lose consciousness again and returned to

562
00:31:34.330 --> 00:31:36.640
normal dreaming.
At times,

563
00:31:36.641 --> 00:31:39.220
this can even trigger say paralysis like we talked about earlier,

564
00:31:39.221 --> 00:31:42.520
which is not commonly experienced at lucid dreamer they're going for,

565
00:31:42.610 --> 00:31:44.500
it's of course,
much less enjoyable.

566
00:31:45.130 --> 00:31:49.650
Generally a number of methods are employed to help lucid dreamers or own Niara

567
00:31:49.651 --> 00:31:53.110
knots,
as they call themselves,
apparently achieved the state,

568
00:31:53.470 --> 00:31:57.310
one of which is to look at once hand than to a clock or written word or

569
00:31:57.311 --> 00:31:57.910
something.

570
00:31:57.910 --> 00:32:01.900
Then back to the hand and back to the object again and the real world over and

571
00:32:01.901 --> 00:32:06.640
over in the real world,
of course,
the clock or the writing will stay similar.

572
00:32:06.730 --> 00:32:07.563
However,

573
00:32:07.690 --> 00:32:11.320
because the left brain which interprets these things is less active during rem

574
00:32:11.321 --> 00:32:14.890
sleep,
the word or time may change without logical structure.

575
00:32:14.890 --> 00:32:16.840
When one looks back at them a second time,

576
00:32:16.930 --> 00:32:19.750
which may then signal that the dreamer isn't a dream.

577
00:32:20.440 --> 00:32:23.320
Lucid dreamers also suggest keeping a dream journal.

578
00:32:23.321 --> 00:32:25.630
Another incentive to keep one,
like I mentioned earlier,

579
00:32:25.960 --> 00:32:29.860
in order to become better familiar with and better at recognizing your dreams.

580
00:32:30.220 --> 00:32:34.330
Science agrees that this leads to consciousness and dreams,

581
00:32:34.360 --> 00:32:38.110
but it isn't quite as certain a dreamer as are able to control the events and

582
00:32:38.111 --> 00:32:39.320
emotions.
Other dreams,

583
00:32:39.500 --> 00:32:43.970
such a subjective experience is not easily studied objectively by science and

584
00:32:43.971 --> 00:32:48.740
because of the nature of dreams.
Reports from dreamers are not always reliable.

585
00:32:49.370 --> 00:32:50.240
Dream reports.

586
00:32:50.270 --> 00:32:54.440
Lucid are not often lose information or contain errors and furthermore,

587
00:32:54.770 --> 00:32:57.960
it is entirely possible that one may feel as though they are controlling the

588
00:32:57.961 --> 00:33:01.130
dream when in reality it's is not the case.
However,

589
00:33:01.190 --> 00:33:04.970
other researchers do disagree and continue to scientifically study the nature of

590
00:33:04.971 --> 00:33:08.480
lucid dreaming.
Up to this point in the discussion,

591
00:33:08.481 --> 00:33:12.620
dreaming has been treated as a scientific curiosity which we observe.

592
00:33:12.770 --> 00:33:15.290
Some of our dreams are negative,
some are positive,

593
00:33:15.291 --> 00:33:19.670
perhaps some we can even control.
They may affect us a great deal emotionally,

594
00:33:19.700 --> 00:33:22.250
but regardless of what happens in our minds at night,

595
00:33:22.580 --> 00:33:25.940
the vast majority of the time,
the vast majority of us get up,

596
00:33:26.090 --> 00:33:30.410
forget about it and go about our days.
For some people,
it's not so simple.

597
00:33:30.770 --> 00:33:35.360
People who suffer from sleep disorders or parasomnias can have a very

598
00:33:35.361 --> 00:33:39.320
troublesome night and dreams can even play a role in the variety of things that

599
00:33:39.321 --> 00:33:41.930
people with a few of these sleep disorders do during the night,

600
00:33:42.410 --> 00:33:43.730
which we will now discuss.

601
00:33:44.030 --> 00:33:48.200
Sleepwalking or some [inaudible] if you want to use a fancy Latin word,

602
00:33:48.201 --> 00:33:51.260
as I mentioned,
doesn't take place during rem sleep as we might expect.

603
00:33:51.860 --> 00:33:56.090
It takes place usually during the end run three stage and is most common during

604
00:33:56.091 --> 00:33:59.000
the earlier sleep cycles.
When slow wave sleep as longer,

605
00:33:59.210 --> 00:34:03.110
though we might reasonably assume that sleepwalking occurs because of dreams

606
00:34:03.111 --> 00:34:07.250
activating a mind as psychologist used to dreams appear to have little to do

607
00:34:07.251 --> 00:34:08.084
with sleepwalking.

608
00:34:08.170 --> 00:34:11.930
Scientists are unsure of what exactly does trigger stick walking.
In fact,

609
00:34:12.530 --> 00:34:14.630
a number of variables increase the risk of it.

610
00:34:14.720 --> 00:34:16.880
It's believed to be at least partly genetic.

611
00:34:16.910 --> 00:34:21.140
Your odds of bar can go up if your family members do it to some disorders like

612
00:34:21.141 --> 00:34:25.910
anxiety disorders,
migraines,
Tourette's and schizophrenia also increase the odds.

613
00:34:26.120 --> 00:34:27.200
Excessive stress,

614
00:34:27.201 --> 00:34:30.830
excessive fatigue and drug use can increase the likelihood of sleep walking with

615
00:34:30.831 --> 00:34:35.660
someone at risk.
However,
what exactly triggers a sleepwalking itself is unknown.

616
00:34:36.260 --> 00:34:40.010
Scientists who have studied sleepwalkers report that brain activity reads

617
00:34:40.011 --> 00:34:44.000
normally for slow wave sleep until suddenly heart rate increases.

618
00:34:44.001 --> 00:34:47.300
Parts of the central nervous system become active and the person that comes to

619
00:34:47.301 --> 00:34:50.300
active.
When sleepwalking and dreams Douche drama go together,

620
00:34:50.301 --> 00:34:53.660
it's considered to be a different disorder,
one that occurs during rem sleep,

621
00:34:53.840 --> 00:34:56.840
rapid eye movement,
sleep behavior disorder or Rpd.

622
00:34:57.050 --> 00:35:01.610
Remembering that in rem sleep our brain resembles our waking activity is key to

623
00:35:01.611 --> 00:35:02.960
understanding this disorder.

624
00:35:03.680 --> 00:35:07.400
Normally we have the sleep paralysis to prevent us from acting out our dream.

625
00:35:07.401 --> 00:35:11.600
It's about the cause of RBD is the disabling of Remy Tonia.
As a result,

626
00:35:11.630 --> 00:35:16.400
people act out a dreams they may talk,
walk around,
eat cooked,
smoked cigarettes,

627
00:35:16.401 --> 00:35:19.250
et Cetera,
and given the negative nature of dreams,

628
00:35:19.280 --> 00:35:23.990
many of these occurrences are negative.
People may yell,
run,
jump,

629
00:35:24.050 --> 00:35:26.180
punch,
fight,
throw things,
et Cetera,

630
00:35:26.181 --> 00:35:29.990
which can harm not only them but people with whom they share a bedroom.

631
00:35:30.650 --> 00:35:34.100
They may even hold conversations with people who are awake while they're still

632
00:35:34.101 --> 00:35:37.800
asleep or interact with them in various ways.
Upon awakening,

633
00:35:37.830 --> 00:35:40.620
people would typically claimed that they were dreaming these events and would

634
00:35:40.621 --> 00:35:42.240
not know that they actually occurred.

635
00:35:43.050 --> 00:35:47.820
Rbds noted as being either a symptom which precedes or follows.
Parkinson's.

636
00:35:47.821 --> 00:35:51.120
Though there are many things which can cause it and it does not always lead the

637
00:35:51.121 --> 00:35:56.040
Parkinson's sleepwalking in both slow wave sleep and rem is considerably

638
00:35:56.041 --> 00:36:00.270
dangerous at times.
It has led to injuries,
deaths and even murder,

639
00:36:00.271 --> 00:36:02.010
which I'll discuss in an upcoming video.

640
00:36:02.011 --> 00:36:05.490
Focusing on parasomnia Slape talking or something.

641
00:36:05.520 --> 00:36:07.350
ELOQUII is close to related to sleep,

642
00:36:07.351 --> 00:36:11.880
walking and occurs in both rem and non rem sleep with differences again in both

643
00:36:11.940 --> 00:36:14.100
but again is most common and and rum.

644
00:36:14.101 --> 00:36:19.101
Three around 50% of children reportedly sleep talk at some point in their lives,

645
00:36:19.201 --> 00:36:22.500
so the majority outgrow it and purity and room three sleep talking.

646
00:36:22.530 --> 00:36:25.860
The most common form generally consists of nonsense or mumbling.

647
00:36:25.890 --> 00:36:28.410
They'll allowed shouting or moaning as possible as well.

648
00:36:28.890 --> 00:36:32.400
Sometimes the words that are related to a dream.
However other times it is not.

649
00:36:32.850 --> 00:36:36.260
Night terrors are another disorder with some connection to dreams and night

650
00:36:36.261 --> 00:36:39.990
terror is not just an edgy term for a nightmare.
It's a separate situation.

651
00:36:40.170 --> 00:36:45.090
Night terrors occur during an rem three and nightmares typically during rem a

652
00:36:45.091 --> 00:36:49.010
night.
Terror is a form of sleepwalking where an individual and as a panicked,

653
00:36:49.050 --> 00:36:51.240
terrified states and begins to react to it.

654
00:36:51.330 --> 00:36:55.650
This may last for a few minutes until the individual goes back to sleep because

655
00:36:55.651 --> 00:36:57.560
night terrors occur and rung.

656
00:36:57.570 --> 00:37:02.130
Three dreams are not always believed to be the regular trigger of them and when

657
00:37:02.131 --> 00:37:02.881
they are related.

658
00:37:02.881 --> 00:37:06.510
Victims of disorder cannot recall the incident at all the next morning usually

659
00:37:06.810 --> 00:37:10.830
let alone the dream dreams,
whatever the content,

660
00:37:10.920 --> 00:37:12.000
whatever their origins,

661
00:37:12.001 --> 00:37:15.630
what have the purpose will likely captivate us for as long as we have them.

662
00:37:16.140 --> 00:37:17.640
The fact that we are on the beginning,

663
00:37:17.650 --> 00:37:20.730
our scientific investigation of them only adds to our mystery.

664
00:37:21.270 --> 00:37:23.760
There are many things we still need to understand.

665
00:37:23.790 --> 00:37:26.250
Many problems we still need to have clarified,

666
00:37:26.400 --> 00:37:28.590
but perhaps for now we should sleep on it.

667
00:37:28.890 --> 00:37:32.580
If you have anything to add about dreams or dream experience you'd like to
share,

668
00:37:32.581 --> 00:37:34.680
I'd be glad to read it in the comment section below.

To support the creation of more videos like these I linked to patriotic,

670
00:37:38.411 --> 00:37:42.510
we found a description or more videos like this and video some many other
