1
00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.620
Deutschland and English.
We refer to this nation as Germany,

2
00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:09.060
a name given to the region by the Romans who called the lens east of the Rhine,

3
00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:10.950
get ammonia Germania.

4
00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.960
The history of Germany is not necessarily the history of a single nation,

5
00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.900
but of a people administering German nations.

6
00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.290
A situation which is not only one of the ancient past,

7
00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.400
but even one which the German people have faced in our modern age.

8
00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.860
This nation's history is fascinating,
impressive,
and profound.
However,

9
00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.250
much of it is overshadowed by more recent events.

10
00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.200
While the events of the first and especially the second world wars with Germany

11
00:00:40.201 --> 00:00:43.290
at the center of both are of major historical importance,

12
00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.870
we must also discuss the hundreds,
in fact,

13
00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.880
thousands of years of German history prior to these events to understand what

14
00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.380
Germany is in the big picture of things.
In this documentary,

15
00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.460
we're going to do just that today here on fire of learning.

16
00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.480
We're going to explore the history of Germany from its earliest beginnings to

17
00:01:03.481 --> 00:01:04.470
the modern age.

18
00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:13.170
The land we know is Germany was first inhabited by modern humans around 35,000

19
00:01:13.171 --> 00:01:15.510
years ago.
The germanic peoples.
However,

20
00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:20.010
our rides in the area near the 3000 years ago as climate change prompted

21
00:01:20.011 --> 00:01:24.030
migration from their origin southward from modern Scandinavia and northern

22
00:01:24.031 --> 00:01:24.600
Germany,

23
00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.950
it is around this time that the Germanic languages and cultures began to become

24
00:01:28.951 --> 00:01:32.130
distinct from the people farther north as they moved.

25
00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:36.210
They encountered and bordered other people's such as the Celts,
Slavs,

26
00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.250
Baltic peoples,
and Scythians.

27
00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.180
Much of what we know of these early people and their lives prior to Roman

28
00:01:42.181 --> 00:01:46.890
contact comes to us from archaeology linguistic analysis and even genetic

29
00:01:46.891 --> 00:01:47.580
testing.

30
00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:51.480
Written records of the peoples of northern Europe in ancient times are scarce,

31
00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:55.650
is the earliest few written accounts are fragments left from the fascinating yet

32
00:01:55.651 --> 00:01:58.430
mysterious men known as pathologists have Musalia,

33
00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:01.290
a Greek explorer and the third century BC.

34
00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:06.000
More detailed descriptions come to us from the Romans who ever expanding

35
00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:10.380
inevitably came into more direct contact,
very direct contact.

36
00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:14.190
One of the first main interactions between the Germanic tribes and the Romans

37
00:02:14.191 --> 00:02:19.191
was the Cambrian war of one 13 to one o one BC sparked as tribes from modern

38
00:02:19.681 --> 00:02:24.570
Germany known as the Kimbery to Tony's and I'm bronies moved further south as

39
00:02:24.571 --> 00:02:28.620
their land farther north had become less hospitable.
They would be defeated,

40
00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:32.610
but this would only mark the beginning of a long intense relationship between

41
00:02:32.611 --> 00:02:34.260
Rome and the German tribes.

42
00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:38.850
The first three or first the Germans as they get a money was Julius Caesar.

43
00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:43.470
Though this classification was more about geography than an actual analysis of

44
00:02:43.471 --> 00:02:45.840
the peoples living in the region.
Who are those shared?

45
00:02:45.841 --> 00:02:50.190
A number of similarities were rather diverse linguistically and culturally and

46
00:02:50.191 --> 00:02:54.720
far from unified.
They in fact were often at war with each other.
Those in Gaul,

47
00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:58.620
we're the Kells.
Those across the Rhine River where the Germans,

48
00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:01.390
he them largely as barbarians.

49
00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:05.440
They were a people who lacked towns and cities and too dependent on primitive

50
00:03:05.441 --> 00:03:06.820
subsistence agriculture,

51
00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:10.330
often leading very difficult lives in comparison to the Romans.

52
00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:14.410
They followed a form of paganism which was similar to others in western Europe

53
00:03:14.411 --> 00:03:14.951
at the time.

54
00:03:14.951 --> 00:03:19.270
Specifically to Norse mythology with an emphasis on nature and the natural

55
00:03:19.271 --> 00:03:20.290
forces around them.

56
00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:24.880
They worshiped gods such as money to Woden sooner and Frig.

57
00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:28.930
You are likely more familiar with these gods by the days named after them.

58
00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:33.670
Mona dog two's,
dog wardens,
dog owners,
dog free dog.

59
00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:38.880
They literally put the England after the fall of Rome via the Anglo Saxons

60
00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:40.930
Tacitus later add it to the Roman understanding,

61
00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:45.670
describing the Germans as a large people with reddish hair and piercing blue

62
00:03:45.671 --> 00:03:49.660
eyes,
referring to the 50 or so dramatic tribes inhabiting the region.

63
00:03:49.661 --> 00:03:51.250
At the time.
At times,

64
00:03:51.251 --> 00:03:56.200
relations between the Romans and the Germans were peaceful and cooperative
trade,

65
00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:59.020
intermarriage and other interactions to place.

66
00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:03.580
At other times there was a brutal warfare under Augustus Caesar.

67
00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:07.720
The Romans would actually attempt to expand into gear Manea.
The area,
however,

68
00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:10.510
was a much harder region to enter and subdue with.
In Gaul,

69
00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:13.150
the thick forested and marshy landscape.

70
00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:17.020
We're very foreign to the Italian Romans and heighten their fears of the

71
00:04:17.021 --> 00:04:19.690
barbarian savages they thought were living within them.

72
00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:23.980
The lack of roads and major towns made the logistics and nightmare for large

73
00:04:23.981 --> 00:04:26.320
Roman army.
As they moved eastward,

74
00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:29.110
the Romans would begin encroaching on the Germans.
Further,

75
00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:32.770
they would build settlements such as Colonia and oak.
Why granny,

76
00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:36.730
which would become cities like loan and Orkin or in a Chappelle.

77
00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:41.110
The Romans attempted to quickly subdue the Armani,
placing taxes on them,

78
00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:44.170
confiscating their weapons,
replacing their old legal systems,

79
00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:46.060
and essentially taking some of them,

80
00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:49.510
particularly the sounds of Nudelman as hostages.

81
00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:52.360
These boys are raised in Rome as Romans,

82
00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:56.830
largely with the hopes that they would return to gear Manea loyal to and

83
00:04:56.831 --> 00:04:59.230
cooperative with Rome.
In the end,
though,

84
00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:02.260
this process would come to backfire on the Romans.

85
00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:05.910
One of these romanized Germans was a man named Arminius,

86
00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:10.300
known in German as Hermando.
Arminius was taken and put into the Roman army,

87
00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:15.330
being the son of a true skin chief during a campaign into his homeland under

88
00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:19.720
quintillion as far as he would later defect to his native side and use his

89
00:05:19.721 --> 00:05:22.570
knowledge of the Roman army to ambush and the feed them.

90
00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:27.810
And September of nine and the Roman army was ambushed by Arminius and an army of

91
00:05:27.821 --> 00:05:30.150
United German tribes near Cal Coryza.

92
00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:33.190
And one is remembered as a battle of two to Berg forest.

93
00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:38.700
Around 20,000 Romans were brutally decimated by the dramatic troops in one of

94
00:05:38.951 --> 00:05:41.470
the most significant battles in Roman history,

95
00:05:41.471 --> 00:05:46.240
if not the most significant for the Germans.
This was a great victory.

96
00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:50.650
Arminius was hailed as a great warrior and in the eyes of some is Germany's

97
00:05:50.651 --> 00:05:54.610
first hero for the Romans.
This was a horrible disaster.

98
00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:58.040
They withdrew their designs of the province of magnet girl Manea,

99
00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:01.010
preventing not only the Romanization of Germany,

100
00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:04.160
but even beyond Arminius would continue to lead,

101
00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:07.820
perhaps envisioning himself as a future king of all the Armani,

102
00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.760
but he was murdered by a political rivals before us.

103
00:06:10.761 --> 00:06:15.400
Such a thing as a United German nation could come to fruition and Kermani are

104
00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:19.340
returned to the Dis United State.
It was in prior to these events,

105
00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:20.750
the main cause of this,

106
00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:25.760
the concept of gear Manea was a Roman invention existing in the minds of Romans,

107
00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:29.210
but not in the hearts of the many different peoples living in the region,

108
00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:30.410
at least not yet.

109
00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:34.790
This would not be the end of the story of Romano driven relations far from it.

110
00:06:34.791 --> 00:06:35.624
In fact,

111
00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:40.460
in the second and third century and as room started showing signs of the k,

112
00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:45.500
the Germanic tribes began coalescing and expanding these tribes would have a

113
00:06:45.501 --> 00:06:50.060
significant impact not only on Germany and in fact not only on Europe,

114
00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:55.130
but the entire Roman empire,
the goths,
vandals,
Franks of the money,

115
00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:59.480
macro money,
but very angles,
Saxons,
lombards and so forth.

116
00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:04.070
The goths would be the most troublesome to the Romans of these groups,
rating,

117
00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:08.720
pillaging and destabilizing many parts of the empire in the fourth century.

118
00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:10.460
As the huns began moving westward,

119
00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:13.940
pressure was placed on the dramatic peoples and they too are forced to move

120
00:07:13.941 --> 00:07:17.000
westward.
As the hunt spilled into the borders of modern Germany,

121
00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:19.970
the Romans significantly weakened at this point,

122
00:07:20.030 --> 00:07:24.050
lack the power to stop the massive waves of people crossing their borders and

123
00:07:24.051 --> 00:07:27.950
settling in our territories and instead attempted to integrate them.

124
00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:29.000
Much of the army,

125
00:07:29.001 --> 00:07:33.740
in fact would later come to be comprised in a majority by dramatic soldiers.

126
00:07:34.130 --> 00:07:39.020
The intention was for these foreigners to be romanized in many ways.

127
00:07:39.110 --> 00:07:40.910
They were in the fourth century,

128
00:07:40.970 --> 00:07:45.110
the ones in Rome who were Christianized and were introduced to the advances of

129
00:07:45.111 --> 00:07:50.111
Roman society around three 50 and the Bible was translated into the gothic

130
00:07:50.601 --> 00:07:53.540
language.
Not exactly German.
There was no German yet,

131
00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:56.870
but it is an ancient relative of German and even English,

132
00:07:56.871 --> 00:07:59.840
which perhaps you can see in this comparison of texts,

133
00:08:00.140 --> 00:08:03.230
the dramatic peoples who left behind their homeland.
We're adapting,

134
00:08:03.380 --> 00:08:06.710
but they would not fully assimilate into the Roman empire.

135
00:08:06.950 --> 00:08:10.670
Rather they would replace it as the Roman Empire fell.

136
00:08:10.730 --> 00:08:15.140
Many of its successor states were formed by or were taken over by rulers from

137
00:08:15.141 --> 00:08:16.400
the Germanic tribes.

138
00:08:16.610 --> 00:08:20.780
These kingdoms would arise in many places even as far as North Africa.

139
00:08:20.930 --> 00:08:23.210
Some of these kingdoms would disappear.

140
00:08:23.540 --> 00:08:25.670
The majority would not become German eyes,

141
00:08:25.671 --> 00:08:29.690
but rather the German ruler's assimilated into the native population.

142
00:08:29.750 --> 00:08:34.220
But some such as the Anglo Saxon dominance and modern England would be more

143
00:08:34.221 --> 00:08:34.850
permanent.

144
00:08:34.850 --> 00:08:39.620
Having a lasting effect on the language and ethnic identity of the people on the

145
00:08:39.621 --> 00:08:40.340
island.

146
00:08:40.340 --> 00:08:44.900
Though never truly under Roman rule and outside the main conflicts caused by

147
00:08:44.901 --> 00:08:49.790
their kin care Manea itself was still directly impacted by the fall of the Roman

148
00:08:49.791 --> 00:08:51.920
empire.
In the coming centuries.

149
00:08:51.950 --> 00:08:54.710
It would be thrown into conflict with Rome successors.

150
00:08:54.711 --> 00:08:57.120
Dates from these conflicts,
however,

151
00:08:57.180 --> 00:09:00.900
would rise further uniformity and cohesion among the Germans

152
00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:05.610
though consider the dark age for many reasons.

153
00:09:05.611 --> 00:09:10.110
The early medieval ages where a time in which we may find the roots of modern

154
00:09:10.111 --> 00:09:14.580
Europe along with its cultures,
languages and ethnic identities.

155
00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:16.860
Germany is no exception to this.

156
00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:21.420
While the east of the modern nation was at this time and habited by Slavs and

157
00:09:21.421 --> 00:09:25.170
the West and south Frank's Friesian,
Bavarians Saxons,

158
00:09:25.171 --> 00:09:30.000
alimony and Thorin gins were slowly becoming more recognizably Germans.

159
00:09:30.330 --> 00:09:32.730
The Franks are of considerable importance.

160
00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:36.090
They would unify the tribe and extend beyond modern Germany.

161
00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:37.850
Power was beginning to center,

162
00:09:37.860 --> 00:09:41.790
run the Franks in a former gall unrich Clovis to first the mayor of engine

163
00:09:41.791 --> 00:09:43.710
dentisty who became king of the Franks.

164
00:09:43.711 --> 00:09:48.711
In a four 81 Clovis began to expand his domain with forests and lands held by

165
00:09:49.021 --> 00:09:52.140
the last bastions of Romans and other dramatic tribes.

166
00:09:52.530 --> 00:09:56.700
By five Oh eight his empire extended throughout a large share of modern Germany,

167
00:09:56.760 --> 00:09:58.290
France,
and the low countries.

168
00:09:58.500 --> 00:10:01.980
It wasn't this year that he made the decision to convert his kingdom to

169
00:10:01.981 --> 00:10:06.330
Catholicism beginning large scale conversion of the people's formerly outside

170
00:10:06.331 --> 00:10:11.000
the Christian Roman Empire when Clovis died around five 12 and his kingdom was a

171
00:10:11.001 --> 00:10:15.090
vital among his four sons and accordance with Frankish tradition.

172
00:10:15.390 --> 00:10:20.220
This process of the vision of Lens among the sons of the Frankish rulers would

173
00:10:20.221 --> 00:10:24.480
impede the unified growth of their domain and the emergence of something like a

174
00:10:24.481 --> 00:10:29.400
true nation state or even a true kingdom in a more modern sense for quite some

175
00:10:29.401 --> 00:10:30.780
time and in fact,

176
00:10:30.781 --> 00:10:35.781
much of the situation of early medieval Germany is defined by this practice

177
00:10:36.270 --> 00:10:41.000
which is called portable inheritance as opposed to primogeniture where the first

178
00:10:41.001 --> 00:10:42.810
born child gets about everything.

179
00:10:43.110 --> 00:10:47.460
Sometimes these rulers would work cohesively as they were expected to.

180
00:10:47.610 --> 00:10:52.170
The intention was after all to create separate domains of one larger kingdom,

181
00:10:52.350 --> 00:10:55.260
but other times saw crippling civil wars.

182
00:10:55.770 --> 00:10:58.260
The Franks would continue pushing into Germany,

183
00:10:58.290 --> 00:11:02.280
but in fighting would continue in a kingdom would eventually be divided into

184
00:11:02.281 --> 00:11:03.360
three regions.

185
00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:08.600
Noise Tria Australia and Burgundy with modern Germany belonging mostly to

186
00:11:08.791 --> 00:11:11.670
Australia,
along with conflict between themselves.

187
00:11:11.671 --> 00:11:15.300
There were also constantly involved in wars with foreigners including the

188
00:11:15.301 --> 00:11:16.320
westward expanding,

189
00:11:16.321 --> 00:11:20.910
Slavs and AVRs depending on the circumstances and the Frankish domains.

190
00:11:20.911 --> 00:11:24.660
At the time the Germans would rural with more or less autonomy.

191
00:11:24.840 --> 00:11:27.150
Paganism was still common in Germany itself,

192
00:11:27.180 --> 00:11:30.690
especially among the majority of the country outside Frankish rural,

193
00:11:30.810 --> 00:11:35.040
and there was yet to be written German language apart from the aforementioned

194
00:11:35.041 --> 00:11:38.010
Gothic,
which was being forgotten in favor of Latin.

195
00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:43.280
In six 13 [inaudible] second of moisture reunited the Franks and established

196
00:11:43.441 --> 00:11:47.370
what is called the mayor of the pallets to help with the administration of the

197
00:11:47.371 --> 00:11:50.040
kingdom.
In effect,
a kind of prime minister,

198
00:11:50.190 --> 00:11:53.770
Germany would continue throughout this period.
At the center of a age,

199
00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:57.550
the German peoples were caught in a power struggle between many competing forces

200
00:11:57.551 --> 00:11:58.360
on the continent,

201
00:11:58.360 --> 00:12:02.680
but we're still United somewhat by a common culture and similar languages.

202
00:12:02.830 --> 00:12:06.820
By the eighth century,
the Merovingians had become effectively puppet kings.

203
00:12:07.060 --> 00:12:12.060
The men with the real power were the mayors of the palace and seven 18 Charles

204
00:12:12.340 --> 00:12:15.130
Martel secure this position.
Charles the hammer,

205
00:12:15.190 --> 00:12:19.840
as his name meant an old French is remembered most famously for his victory at

206
00:12:19.841 --> 00:12:24.460
the battle of tour where he defeated the Muslim who my odds preventing nations

207
00:12:24.461 --> 00:12:28.570
such as France or even Germany from Islamic takeover.
However,

208
00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:32.170
Charles would struggle not only with Muslims but Germans as well.

209
00:12:32.290 --> 00:12:33.220
Before that battle,

210
00:12:33.250 --> 00:12:38.170
which took place in seven 32 he was involved in the war against Varian's Saxons,

211
00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:42.730
Lamonti and Free Asians from seven 18 to seven 30 VBA Varian's.

212
00:12:42.730 --> 00:12:45.790
We're often independent minded and uncooperative,

213
00:12:45.970 --> 00:12:47.920
not something that would change anytime soon,

214
00:12:48.130 --> 00:12:52.910
and the Saxons were pagans who frequently rated Frankish territory in seven 51

215
00:12:52.911 --> 00:12:56.950
the veil was officially taken off by Martella successor with the support of the

216
00:12:56.951 --> 00:13:00.440
Pope Charles Martel son Pepin the short depose.

217
00:13:00.441 --> 00:13:04.420
The last Merovingian kings show the Rick the third with the end of the mirror

218
00:13:04.421 --> 00:13:06.130
visions came a new dynasty.

219
00:13:06.310 --> 00:13:09.880
The Carol Engines Pepin would rule for 10 years.

220
00:13:09.940 --> 00:13:11.590
His most major contribution,

221
00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:15.850
which would have a permanent effect on Europe was the donation of Pepin,

222
00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.670
which was essentially a land grant to the pope,

223
00:13:18.820 --> 00:13:22.030
which would be known as the papal states.
However,

224
00:13:22.120 --> 00:13:26.080
it would be his son who laid the foundations for much of modern Europe,

225
00:13:26.110 --> 00:13:28.090
including the German nation state,

226
00:13:28.150 --> 00:13:32.300
and he's remembered for no less than this achievement,
often called patera.

227
00:13:32.330 --> 00:13:34.570
I I by the father of Europe,

228
00:13:34.600 --> 00:13:37.510
he's referred to as Charles the Great Carl there.

229
00:13:37.510 --> 00:13:41.050
Grossa or Charlemagne Charles United,

230
00:13:41.051 --> 00:13:46.051
both halves of the Frankish empire and 70 71 when his brother Carlo and died of

231
00:13:46.121 --> 00:13:48.760
natural causes almost immediately.

232
00:13:48.820 --> 00:13:52.840
He set his sights on expanding into Germany where he would come into contact

233
00:13:52.841 --> 00:13:54.490
with one of his greatest foes.

234
00:13:54.550 --> 00:13:59.110
The restless Pagan Saxons led by rulers such as one called Vito [inaudible],

235
00:13:59.140 --> 00:14:02.770
which meant forest child back then that implies something fierce,

236
00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:05.050
more like a wolf as opposed to you know,

237
00:14:05.230 --> 00:14:10.230
freedom flowerchild and seven 72 Charlemagne invaded Saxony subjugating one of

238
00:14:11.261 --> 00:14:16.000
the May tribes and desecrating Pagan religious monuments such as a hollow tree

239
00:14:16.030 --> 00:14:19.840
known as Earman Sule,
which the Saxons believed held up the sky.

240
00:14:20.170 --> 00:14:21.940
Charlemagne did not stay long.

241
00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:26.070
Turning his attention to Italy specifically toward the troublesome Lombards,

242
00:14:26.190 --> 00:14:30.130
his sentence of German invaders with a name meaning long beards who were

243
00:14:30.131 --> 00:14:33.190
agitating the pope and Italy.
Nevertheless,

244
00:14:33.280 --> 00:14:36.460
things weren't quite so finished in Saxony.
In fact,

245
00:14:36.490 --> 00:14:41.170
war would continue for 30 years until eight Oh four the primary reason for this

246
00:14:41.171 --> 00:14:45.880
was paganism,
but also be fractured structure of Saxon society.

247
00:14:45.970 --> 00:14:50.110
There were not unified and the various groups acted independently and had to be

248
00:14:50.111 --> 00:14:54.290
subdued when Charlemagne was distracted by other conflicts,

249
00:14:54.291 --> 00:14:59.270
especially a tended to revolt attacking Frankish soldiers,
priests and churches.

250
00:14:59.540 --> 00:15:04.400
The Franks would respond bitterly and one incident and Verdian and seven 82

251
00:15:04.520 --> 00:15:09.520
Charlemagne order that 4,500 people and be beheaded for a rebellion even by his

252
00:15:10.431 --> 00:15:11.360
contemporaries.

253
00:15:11.390 --> 00:15:15.740
This act was seen as excessive brutality as he subdued the Saxons,

254
00:15:15.830 --> 00:15:18.980
he and his missionaries and Forest Christianity on them harshly.

255
00:15:19.010 --> 00:15:24.010
The penalty for refusing baptism was death and seven 85 Vito kin surrendered and

256
00:15:24.741 --> 00:15:28.160
willingly agreed to be baptized.
The other Saxons fought on.

257
00:15:28.250 --> 00:15:33.020
Charlemagne continued to expand eastward into other parts of Germany as well and

258
00:15:33.021 --> 00:15:37.130
even beyond.
In seven 88 he went to war with the Bavarians.

259
00:15:37.190 --> 00:15:41.420
He would then expand further eastward from there fighting the AVRs and Slavs

260
00:15:42.080 --> 00:15:46.880
after years of conquest and conversions on Christmas day in 800 Aidy,

261
00:15:47.120 --> 00:15:51.680
Charlemagne was crowned emperor of the Romans by Pope Leo the third.

262
00:15:51.770 --> 00:15:56.770
This was the beginning of something that would outlive him for a little over a

263
00:15:57.650 --> 00:16:01.400
thousand years.
It was not just a pump as title.
As time went on,

264
00:16:01.460 --> 00:16:06.460
some historians would consider Charlemagne to be the first holy Roman emperor

265
00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:10.940
that has not agreed upon some consider out of the first whom we will talk about

266
00:16:10.941 --> 00:16:14.810
soon to be the first true ruler a century later because Charlemagne was not

267
00:16:14.811 --> 00:16:19.010
actually the ruler of the holy Roman Empire and the sense that it would later

268
00:16:19.011 --> 00:16:22.880
take the term holy would not be added until a few hundred years later,

269
00:16:22.910 --> 00:16:24.860
but the intention was for Charlemagne,

270
00:16:24.861 --> 00:16:29.090
his empire to be viewed as the reincarnation of Rome.

271
00:16:29.150 --> 00:16:33.110
Although admittedly he and his subjects tended to prefer their Frankish identity

272
00:16:33.290 --> 00:16:34.340
as time goes on,

273
00:16:34.370 --> 00:16:39.370
the holy Roman Empire would not really live up to any of its names as we shall

274
00:16:39.411 --> 00:16:41.240
see the intention of Pope Leo.

275
00:16:41.240 --> 00:16:46.130
The third was to be the spiritual leader of the Christian world and Charlemagne

276
00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:50.990
the secular and for the emperor in Pope to work in tandem ruling over a new

277
00:16:50.991 --> 00:16:55.190
Rome.
The intended and mutually beneficial relationship here,
however,

278
00:16:55.230 --> 00:16:57.860
would eventually become a source of conflict.

279
00:16:57.920 --> 00:17:02.920
This event also caused dispute with the Byzantines and not for the last time who

280
00:17:02.961 --> 00:17:07.100
were fairly offended by the notion of Charlemagne calling himself emperor of

281
00:17:07.101 --> 00:17:10.910
Rome when they consider themselves the Romans.
Remember of course,

282
00:17:10.911 --> 00:17:13.340
that the Roman empire only fell in the west.

283
00:17:13.490 --> 00:17:17.480
The east or the Byzantines had continued and we're still standing strong.

284
00:17:17.780 --> 00:17:20.240
Pope Leo wasn't concerned by this.

285
00:17:20.270 --> 00:17:23.540
The Byzantine head of state at the time was a woman,

286
00:17:23.570 --> 00:17:25.760
so he felt that the title was vacant,

287
00:17:26.340 --> 00:17:30.110
but tension between East and West would not quickly does appear.
In fact,

288
00:17:30.230 --> 00:17:33.290
it would carry on until the death of Byzantium itself.

289
00:17:33.560 --> 00:17:37.370
Following his coordination,
Charlemagne would continue to expand his domain.

290
00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:38.250
In total,

291
00:17:38.250 --> 00:17:42.740
his empire would encompass almost all of western and central Europe and even

292
00:17:42.741 --> 00:17:46.850
beyond.
Charlemagne was not only a man of the sword.
However,

293
00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:50.790
he oversaw a number of intellectual achievements that have led to his rain being

294
00:17:50.791 --> 00:17:53.670
referred to as the Carolingian renaissance.

295
00:17:53.820 --> 00:17:58.820
Charlemagne died and eight 14 eight d the empire he constructed form the basis

296
00:17:59.520 --> 00:18:01.140
for rebirth of Europe.

297
00:18:01.320 --> 00:18:06.210
He had intended to divide his kingdom up among his sons a practice so firmly

298
00:18:06.211 --> 00:18:08.700
rooted in tradition that not even he would break it,

299
00:18:08.730 --> 00:18:12.420
but only one Louie or Ludvig would outlive him.

300
00:18:13.050 --> 00:18:17.670
While that may seem as though having one air would hold the empire together,

301
00:18:17.730 --> 00:18:22.200
Louis the pious would not rule as strongly as his father had and would often

302
00:18:22.201 --> 00:18:25.770
have to struggle to keep the empire together against an array of enemies

303
00:18:25.771 --> 00:18:29.880
assembling from outside as empire and even against his own sons.

304
00:18:30.030 --> 00:18:31.800
Louie was not a harsh ruler,

305
00:18:31.860 --> 00:18:36.210
but he was quite simply not the right man for the times.
In fact,

306
00:18:36.211 --> 00:18:39.870
he has said who have wanted to have been a priest rather than an emperor.

307
00:18:40.020 --> 00:18:44.880
He died in eight 40 and after a series of external and internal wars,

308
00:18:44.910 --> 00:18:48.720
he had tried to leave the empire to his eldest son to prevent the collapse of

309
00:18:48.721 --> 00:18:53.130
Christian Europe,
but his other sons rebelled successfully against this decision.

310
00:18:53.190 --> 00:18:57.480
Two years following the battle of font and NOI and eight 41 the kingdom was

311
00:18:57.481 --> 00:19:01.110
divided into three with the treaty of fair doing Charles,

312
00:19:01.111 --> 00:19:04.530
the bald would rule the western portion,
low tar.

313
00:19:04.560 --> 00:19:08.370
The lands in the center and Ludvig the Lens and the east,

314
00:19:08.430 --> 00:19:13.230
specifically the regions east of the Rhine and north of Italy,
Bavaria,

315
00:19:13.320 --> 00:19:16.020
Franconia,
Saxony and Swabia.

316
00:19:16.140 --> 00:19:20.400
This event is considered a very significant milestone in German history,

317
00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:21.630
east and west.

318
00:19:21.640 --> 00:19:26.640
Frankia now with different languages and cultures would be basically permanently

319
00:19:26.731 --> 00:19:30.390
severed and we're on a path to develop and to separate nations.

320
00:19:30.570 --> 00:19:34.960
France and Germany.
Ludvig would later receive the old Roman title gear,

321
00:19:34.961 --> 00:19:37.890
Monica's,
which meant conqueror of the Germans.

322
00:19:38.040 --> 00:19:40.380
Ludvig is promptly known as Louis,

323
00:19:40.381 --> 00:19:44.820
the German or Ludvig there Deutscher and German or lewd fig.

324
00:19:44.821 --> 00:19:49.821
The mites and check at this time as the German identity was in a very important

325
00:19:50.431 --> 00:19:51.750
stage of coming together.

326
00:19:51.780 --> 00:19:56.310
The peoples of Europe disagreed on what exactly to call this variety of people

327
00:19:56.311 --> 00:19:58.260
with similar cultures and languages.

328
00:19:58.470 --> 00:20:03.470
This issue was never really resolved and today there remains a variety of names

329
00:20:03.781 --> 00:20:07.470
for Germany in different languages which are seemingly unrelated.

330
00:20:07.560 --> 00:20:11.640
This treaty of their Dune.
While that provided stability would not end,

331
00:20:11.641 --> 00:20:15.720
the conflict between the three brothers permanently and fighting would continue

332
00:20:15.721 --> 00:20:18.360
on and off.
In fact,
after Charlemagne,

333
00:20:18.450 --> 00:20:22.350
Germany's history for the next few centuries would be marked by constant

334
00:20:22.351 --> 00:20:23.184
conflict.

335
00:20:23.250 --> 00:20:28.250
Germany or east Frankia would be surrounded by rivals at various times fighting

336
00:20:28.770 --> 00:20:30.690
Norse vikings,
the Slavs,

337
00:20:30.840 --> 00:20:34.020
which would later include groups such as the Moravians and Polish.

338
00:20:34.080 --> 00:20:38.040
The Magyars not want to loot Vic's doorstep.
The northern Italians,

339
00:20:38.100 --> 00:20:41.490
the Saracens for Muslims,
the Byzantines and the West,

340
00:20:41.491 --> 00:20:46.260
Franks or later the French,
the name,
the main ones,
arguably east Frankie.

341
00:20:46.261 --> 00:20:48.670
His biggest enemy though was itself.

342
00:20:48.970 --> 00:20:53.380
Divisions among family would constantly fracture and via the land threatening

343
00:20:53.381 --> 00:20:54.850
its very existence.

344
00:20:54.880 --> 00:20:58.870
For centuries it was not long before the Kingdom of Middle Frankia will be

345
00:20:58.871 --> 00:20:59.704
broken apart.

346
00:20:59.800 --> 00:21:04.140
It was the least stable of the three and had even less cohesion than that of

347
00:21:04.150 --> 00:21:05.650
really France and early Germany,

348
00:21:05.710 --> 00:21:10.210
which though facing division had at least similar languages and ethnic groups.

349
00:21:10.540 --> 00:21:12.910
Many different ones were forming in an awkwardly,

350
00:21:12.911 --> 00:21:16.570
formed a territory now encompassing the Netherlands down to Italy.

351
00:21:16.780 --> 00:21:19.150
The territory of Lorraine.
However,

352
00:21:19.180 --> 00:21:23.020
between modern France and Germany is a corruption of low towering.
Yeah.

353
00:21:23.170 --> 00:21:26.050
And this region still carries a name of low tar,

354
00:21:26.080 --> 00:21:30.640
which is more obvious in a modern German name not ringing Ludvig and Charles

355
00:21:30.641 --> 00:21:34.450
eventually sees Lorraine and divided it in a treaty of misson.

356
00:21:34.660 --> 00:21:38.020
This would not solve the dispute over the region,
though in fact,

357
00:21:38.050 --> 00:21:42.130
it would be a constant cause of conflict for over a Millennium Ludvig.

358
00:21:42.131 --> 00:21:46.390
The German died in [inaudible] 76 and as you probably expect at this point,

359
00:21:46.570 --> 00:21:49.400
his kingdom was divided among his sons Ludvig,

360
00:21:49.440 --> 00:21:51.790
the younger Carla [inaudible] and Carl,

361
00:21:51.850 --> 00:21:54.550
who would sometime later be known as Carl,

362
00:21:54.551 --> 00:21:59.551
their decay or an English Charles the fat who actually briefly reunited

363
00:22:00.281 --> 00:22:03.310
Charlemagne's empire and became holy Roman emperor,

364
00:22:03.430 --> 00:22:05.950
not so much because he was a great conqueror,

365
00:22:06.010 --> 00:22:09.640
but because every other air in Germany and France had died,

366
00:22:10.030 --> 00:22:15.030
Carl would be the last to rule over a United Frankish empire in the late sixties

367
00:22:15.100 --> 00:22:20.080
the Magyars had finally reached East Frankia rating a territory mercilessly and

368
00:22:20.081 --> 00:22:23.800
centering their power not far away in the modern nation of Hungary,

369
00:22:23.890 --> 00:22:26.230
which the Magyars would later be responsible for.

370
00:22:26.231 --> 00:22:29.770
Founding Mush of Carl's rain was spent dealing with them,

371
00:22:29.830 --> 00:22:34.270
as well as the vikings whose raids by now reached the city of Ochin in which

372
00:22:34.271 --> 00:22:38.440
Charlemagne had centered much of his empire and where his palace was built as

373
00:22:38.441 --> 00:22:42.330
well as Paris and the Rhineland.
Things were not going well for Carl.

374
00:22:42.970 --> 00:22:47.620
His rule was brief is lifelong struggle with sickness and epilepsy made ruling

375
00:22:47.621 --> 00:22:52.300
over an uncooperative empire,
difficult,
and he was deposed by his nephew,

376
00:22:52.301 --> 00:22:57.220
Arnulf and eight 87 Arnold would not be able to claim the entire kingdom.

377
00:22:57.221 --> 00:23:02.150
However,
and the Frankish empire split apart this time permanently.
But Avaya,

378
00:23:02.160 --> 00:23:05.110
it's between the two halves were too great to seal.
By now.

379
00:23:05.380 --> 00:23:08.200
Arnold merely retain the German area of the country.

380
00:23:08.410 --> 00:23:12.730
East Frankia importantly,
are enough.
Did not merely take the throne,

381
00:23:12.870 --> 00:23:17.710
was elected by the nobility to became the concept of electing leaders in Germany

382
00:23:17.711 --> 00:23:20.740
data back to ancient times,
and as we shall see,

383
00:23:20.800 --> 00:23:23.900
did not disappear anytime soon are an officer.

384
00:23:23.910 --> 00:23:28.900
Terrain would be marked by unsuccessful wars with the Slavs Vikings,
Moravians,

385
00:23:28.901 --> 00:23:29.770
and Magyars.

386
00:23:30.190 --> 00:23:34.540
He died in eight and 99 and was succeeded by his six year old son Ludovic the

387
00:23:34.541 --> 00:23:38.560
child who would only live to the age of 20 throughout allude Vic's rain.

388
00:23:38.590 --> 00:23:43.190
Every corner of journey was ravaged by the Maggie or horseman.
Furthermore,

389
00:23:43.240 --> 00:23:45.870
the Dukes of the various regions,
Dutch,
he's obese,

390
00:23:45.890 --> 00:23:50.660
Frankia asserted more independence,
threatening to break the kingdom apart.

391
00:23:50.900 --> 00:23:55.790
Ludvig the child died in the year nine 11 as the last Carolingian kings,

392
00:23:56.160 --> 00:24:00.710
but Germans had to focus on their own affairs and elected a king from outside

393
00:24:00.711 --> 00:24:05.190
the Carolingian line rather than respect,
Charles is simple,
king of France,

394
00:24:05.191 --> 00:24:10.190
his claim to the throne one such a fair was the Magyars who were a more major

395
00:24:10.191 --> 00:24:14.120
threat to the Germans and the Vikings,
which France was focused on.

396
00:24:14.360 --> 00:24:17.780
Conrad Duke of [inaudible] was elected to be their king.

397
00:24:18.080 --> 00:24:23.060
The election of rulers was resurfacing as a common trend and that is here where

398
00:24:23.061 --> 00:24:28.061
we begin to see the complex political structure of what would be called the holy

399
00:24:28.101 --> 00:24:29.660
Roman Empire arise.

400
00:24:29.780 --> 00:24:33.980
Although Conrad did not receive the title of Emperor of Rome that had gone to

401
00:24:33.981 --> 00:24:37.640
rulers in Italy at this point,
becoming essentially a reward.

402
00:24:37.640 --> 00:24:40.310
The pope gave out to any ruler who would help him.

403
00:24:40.850 --> 00:24:42.710
Conrad though king a name,

404
00:24:42.980 --> 00:24:46.820
did not have much authority over the Dukes who made him king and he would

405
00:24:46.821 --> 00:24:49.550
struggle to assert his authority throughout his reign,

406
00:24:49.940 --> 00:24:54.940
often fighting both his subjects and foreigners like he was more like a grand

407
00:24:55.131 --> 00:24:56.180
Duke.
Then King.

408
00:24:56.840 --> 00:25:01.160
This power struggle between the monarch and nobles of the semi autonomous states

409
00:25:01.161 --> 00:25:04.910
that put them there would be another feature which would mark the holy Roman

410
00:25:04.911 --> 00:25:06.980
empire,
his existence and the long run.

411
00:25:07.250 --> 00:25:12.250
Conrad would actually be severely wounded fighting the rebellious variance and

412
00:25:12.411 --> 00:25:15.530
on his deathbed he proposed to his brother that Heinrich,

413
00:25:15.620 --> 00:25:20.570
the Duke of Saxony should be the next king.
Heinrich was an enemy of Conrad.

414
00:25:20.750 --> 00:25:24.200
Conrad knew he was the man that could hold the nation together.

415
00:25:24.560 --> 00:25:29.510
Conrad died in 1918 and the nobles appeared to agree with him electing Heinrich

416
00:25:29.540 --> 00:25:31.640
as their next king.
A few months later,

417
00:25:31.940 --> 00:25:36.830
Heinrich known as Heinrich there Fogler or Henry the Fowler after his hobby of

418
00:25:36.831 --> 00:25:41.831
Falconry was the first native German to be King of Germany beginning the Saxon,

419
00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:42.833
Tennessee.

420
00:25:42.890 --> 00:25:46.940
The threat of the Magyars was an immediate concern of Heinrich upon his rise to

421
00:25:46.941 --> 00:25:50.090
power,
though initially facing the fit against them,

422
00:25:50.180 --> 00:25:54.530
he eventually had a stroke of luck to feeding the Magyars in taking a son of

423
00:25:54.531 --> 00:25:58.310
their leader prisoner.
In exchange for the Magyar Prince's released.

424
00:25:58.340 --> 00:26:00.350
He demanded 10 years of peace.

425
00:26:00.920 --> 00:26:05.390
The brief cease fire allowed Heinrich the opportunity to continue war with the

426
00:26:05.391 --> 00:26:10.190
Slavs train is infantry and build fortifications around his domain.

427
00:26:10.610 --> 00:26:13.250
In nine 32 when the Magyars returned,

428
00:26:13.370 --> 00:26:17.420
he defeated them at the battle of Riata dealing a major blow to them.

429
00:26:17.810 --> 00:26:20.000
Heinrich was a great ruler militarily,

430
00:26:20.090 --> 00:26:25.010
but he never consolidated power politically in a form of absolute rural either.

431
00:26:25.130 --> 00:26:30.130
Germany persisted as he kind of confederation of semi autonomous Dutchies over

432
00:26:30.171 --> 00:26:33.110
which she had limited power.
Nevertheless,

433
00:26:33.200 --> 00:26:36.260
he had strengthened and protect the nation as a whole.

434
00:26:36.500 --> 00:26:41.150
He died nine 36 and his son was elected that year.

435
00:26:41.510 --> 00:26:42.350
Importantly,

436
00:26:42.410 --> 00:26:47.410
Heinrich did divide his the main among his sons despite an opportunity to do so

437
00:26:47.970 --> 00:26:50.430
living in all intact to a successor.

438
00:26:50.550 --> 00:26:54.480
His son Otto would reign for nearly 40 years.

439
00:26:54.810 --> 00:26:55.740
In that time,

440
00:26:55.830 --> 00:27:00.060
his achievements and building the germination and the holy Roman Empire would

441
00:27:00.061 --> 00:27:01.950
earn him the title.
It's a great

442
00:27:08.070 --> 00:27:10.410
auto,
was ambitious and bold,

443
00:27:10.440 --> 00:27:14.640
essentially viewing himself as no less than the successor of Charlemagne.

444
00:27:14.700 --> 00:27:19.530
His reign was marked naturally early on by conflict with his younger brother and

445
00:27:19.531 --> 00:27:21.510
the other German nobles and furthermore,

446
00:27:21.511 --> 00:27:26.220
he was involved in the regular wars with Slavs,
vikings and French.
However,

447
00:27:26.221 --> 00:27:27.180
as time went on,

448
00:27:27.210 --> 00:27:31.110
auto actually began to break out of this continuous cycle of that caused this

449
00:27:31.111 --> 00:27:31.770
disorder.

450
00:27:31.770 --> 00:27:36.210
He defeated his arrivals and then again to try to transform the structure of the

451
00:27:36.211 --> 00:27:39.930
germination of the time.
By centering power on the monarchy,

452
00:27:39.960 --> 00:27:44.110
he would replace rebellious dukes and nobles with those loyal to him calm and

453
00:27:44.111 --> 00:27:48.240
they relatives and intentionally overruled the authorities of all the others

454
00:27:48.300 --> 00:27:53.300
signifying that loyalty to and cooperation with the monarch was the way forward.

455
00:27:53.820 --> 00:27:57.900
He ruled from horseback,
often touring his domain for half the year.

456
00:27:57.930 --> 00:28:01.920
He would endeavor to control the church and use it as a means to strengthen his

457
00:28:01.921 --> 00:28:02.430
rule.

458
00:28:02.430 --> 00:28:06.510
By the nine fifties he had settled many of his domestic troubles and began to

459
00:28:06.511 --> 00:28:07.560
expand outward.

460
00:28:07.650 --> 00:28:12.060
One of his prime interest was Italy where the widowed queen of Northern Italy,

461
00:28:12.150 --> 00:28:16.950
Adelaide call to auto for help after bearing guard the second had you served her

462
00:28:16.951 --> 00:28:21.951
husband's thrown auto cross the Alps and nine 51 where he took the city of

463
00:28:22.240 --> 00:28:25.950
Fovea,
he would in turn Mary Adelaide,
his second wife,

464
00:28:26.100 --> 00:28:30.480
this second marriage angered auto son from his first wife Leah dolls,

465
00:28:30.600 --> 00:28:32.250
especially when she bore him.

466
00:28:32.250 --> 00:28:36.000
A son who threatened lead dog succession outraged.

467
00:28:36.001 --> 00:28:40.740
He would rebel against his father and nine 53 alongside other frustrated nobos.

468
00:28:40.830 --> 00:28:45.510
The rebellions spiraled out of control and the situation was exacerbated when

469
00:28:45.511 --> 00:28:47.640
the Magyars moved into Bavaria,

470
00:28:47.730 --> 00:28:50.760
lead all would later become cooperative with the Magyars.

471
00:28:50.820 --> 00:28:55.170
It was not long before the situation began to threaten autos,
rain itself,

472
00:28:55.320 --> 00:29:00.320
but it would be abruptly ended and nine 54 partially because so many nobles felt

473
00:29:01.110 --> 00:29:03.930
that in alliance with the Magyars was excessive.

474
00:29:03.931 --> 00:29:08.931
Treachery Auto at times a very merciful ruler for gave his son for all his

475
00:29:09.001 --> 00:29:11.400
crimes with the domestic situation.

476
00:29:11.401 --> 00:29:16.401
Finally stable auto now turned his attention to the invading Magyars in the

477
00:29:16.530 --> 00:29:21.120
spring of nine 55 war with the Magyars would resume but auto with the feed them

478
00:29:21.121 --> 00:29:25.410
on multiple occasions throughout the year.
On August 10th the two sides,

479
00:29:25.411 --> 00:29:27.360
we're squaring up for a major battle.

480
00:29:27.750 --> 00:29:32.390
The Battle of Lek Feld near Augsburg and Bavaria Auto,
how to forests.

481
00:29:32.391 --> 00:29:36.840
I'm around 8,000 men obtained from across Germany and Bohemia.

482
00:29:36.960 --> 00:29:40.740
The Magyars live.
We had a forest around twice the size of this.

483
00:29:40.870 --> 00:29:42.130
Despite this auto

484
00:29:42.130 --> 00:29:44.350
<v 1>had some favorable factors.</v>

485
00:29:44.590 --> 00:29:48.940
The battle was to take place on an aeroplane between two rivers,
the Magyars.

486
00:29:48.970 --> 00:29:51.670
We're not as accustomed to fighting pitched battles.

487
00:29:51.760 --> 00:29:54.820
They were horse archers who preferred hit and run tactics.

488
00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:58.540
Despite this swarm of arrows that rained down on the German troops.

489
00:29:58.600 --> 00:30:01.030
They were no match for autos.
Heavy cavalry,

490
00:30:01.060 --> 00:30:03.070
the predecessor of the Medieval Knight,

491
00:30:03.220 --> 00:30:07.330
they destroyed the Magyars in his battle dealing if fatal blow to them.

492
00:30:07.480 --> 00:30:08.440
Following this,

493
00:30:08.500 --> 00:30:13.150
the Magyars gave up on the rating of western Europe altogether that same year

494
00:30:13.180 --> 00:30:17.050
auto would lead US forces to victory against the invading Slavs and pushed

495
00:30:17.051 --> 00:30:21.970
further into their territory is victories over the foreign pagan invaders led to

496
00:30:21.971 --> 00:30:25.090
many viewing him as the savior of Christendom.

497
00:30:25.210 --> 00:30:30.210
Things were beginning to go smoothly for him when and nine 58 trouble in Italy

498
00:30:30.281 --> 00:30:35.281
returned with Behringer auto intervened and by nine 62 he had taken much of

499
00:30:36.071 --> 00:30:40.870
northern Italy for himself effectively conjoining,
northern Italy and Germany.

500
00:30:40.930 --> 00:30:45.190
That year the pope would bestow upon him the same title which had been given to

501
00:30:45.191 --> 00:30:49.030
Charlemagne emperor of Rome.
It's us as a result of this,

502
00:30:49.090 --> 00:30:54.040
what would later be called the holy Roman Empire began or continued.

503
00:30:54.070 --> 00:30:55.810
It is debated,
but regardless,

504
00:30:55.811 --> 00:31:00.811
this was the beginning of a new age for the kings of Germany as the first Reich

505
00:31:01.030 --> 00:31:06.030
with auto as the first German to hold the title is empire throughout the

506
00:31:06.400 --> 00:31:11.020
centuries would be regarded not as an empire,
but as the empire,

507
00:31:11.110 --> 00:31:13.120
not a state within Christendom,

508
00:31:13.270 --> 00:31:17.050
but the true Christian state almost immediately,
however,

509
00:31:17.051 --> 00:31:20.640
conflicts between the pope and emperor of again and auto had jaw,

510
00:31:20.641 --> 00:31:24.610
the 12th deposed and replaced this would temporarily help things,

511
00:31:24.611 --> 00:31:29.290
but outro would struggle with the papacy and Italy for the rest of his life and

512
00:31:29.291 --> 00:31:34.030
would even have to end up ruling from Rome at certain points to stabilize
things.

513
00:31:34.150 --> 00:31:35.350
Italy,
however,

514
00:31:35.380 --> 00:31:40.240
would seldom in the empire's history be happy under the rule of the two tins and

515
00:31:40.241 --> 00:31:44.530
would always be distant to try to ease relations with the Byzantines who were

516
00:31:44.531 --> 00:31:48.670
again jealous of the title of Emperor of Rome,
which he had taken autos,

517
00:31:48.671 --> 00:31:53.470
youngest and sole surviving son and heir,
also named auto at this time.

518
00:31:53.471 --> 00:31:57.510
16 would marry a Byzantine Princess,
say,
oh Fano the emperor,

519
00:31:57.511 --> 00:32:01.930
his niece who was at this time 12 auto would die the following year in

520
00:32:01.931 --> 00:32:06.280
[inaudible] 73 out of the second to became king.
Immediately thereafter,

521
00:32:06.310 --> 00:32:10.720
his position security even before his father's death as a noble is elected him

522
00:32:10.721 --> 00:32:13.330
king with auto,
the first breathing down their necks.

523
00:32:13.480 --> 00:32:16.540
Much of his reign was marked by domestic conflict,

524
00:32:16.541 --> 00:32:20.350
which arose without his father there as well as a war with the Danes,

525
00:32:20.351 --> 00:32:22.480
French Arabs,
Slavs and Byzantines.

526
00:32:22.570 --> 00:32:26.590
But when he died suddenly at the age of 28 from malaria,

527
00:32:26.620 --> 00:32:31.180
his young son who would be out of the third was elected and crowned.

528
00:32:31.300 --> 00:32:35.440
Despite the issues facing the empire and an attempted usurpation,

529
00:32:35.470 --> 00:32:40.130
the crown would successfully passed to auto the third when he was of age and

530
00:32:40.131 --> 00:32:45.131
nine 94 out of the third though young was exceptionally bright and he envisioned

531
00:32:45.501 --> 00:32:48.110
himself as the true ruler of Christendom,

532
00:32:48.230 --> 00:32:53.230
the one who would truly revive the Roman Empire in January of 10 oh two however,

533
00:32:53.480 --> 00:32:58.340
at the age of 21 he died while suppressing rebellion in Italy have a strange

534
00:32:58.341 --> 00:33:03.341
sudden fever out of the third had died unexpectedly without having been married

535
00:33:03.411 --> 00:33:06.500
and with no children.
Whatever future he envisioned,

536
00:33:06.560 --> 00:33:10.550
along with the stability that the atony Ian's and our subjects had brought to

537
00:33:10.551 --> 00:33:14.510
the empire would not be challenged as multiple contenders bickered for the

538
00:33:14.511 --> 00:33:16.820
throne.
Eventually,
his cousin,

539
00:33:16.850 --> 00:33:21.850
Heinrich Duka Bavaria would become king in a complicated and heated contention

540
00:33:22.640 --> 00:33:25.130
in which rivals once more went to war,

541
00:33:25.220 --> 00:33:29.900
but he became Heinrich this second and 10 oh two king of Italy and 10 oh four

542
00:33:30.050 --> 00:33:35.050
and holy Roman emperor and 10 14 clearly much of his reign was spent trying to

543
00:33:35.871 --> 00:33:38.930
secure the authority that the [inaudible] had wielded.

544
00:33:39.050 --> 00:33:42.980
He also spend time fighting Poland over the territory of Bohemia,

545
00:33:43.220 --> 00:33:44.690
the Modern Day Czech Republic,

546
00:33:44.870 --> 00:33:49.280
the independent minded German nobles or printers weren't heartbroken to see a

547
00:33:49.281 --> 00:33:51.560
distracted wheat king on a throne.

548
00:33:51.710 --> 00:33:55.100
Heinrich died in 10 24 again with no air.

549
00:33:55.160 --> 00:33:59.960
This brought an end to the Atonia and dentisty and once more the German nobles

550
00:33:59.961 --> 00:34:03.290
would have to choose a king,
they would choose Conrad of the second,

551
00:34:03.350 --> 00:34:08.350
thus beginning the salient dentisty Conrad like his predecessor is spent much of

552
00:34:08.601 --> 00:34:11.090
his early rain traveling around his domain.

553
00:34:11.210 --> 00:34:16.010
It may seem odd that a ruler would spend so little time and the capital city,

554
00:34:16.070 --> 00:34:21.070
but at this time and for much of the time there was no capital city of the holy

555
00:34:21.471 --> 00:34:24.800
Roman Empire.
The closest thing would have been the city of [inaudible],

556
00:34:24.830 --> 00:34:29.830
but effectively the capital of the empire was wherever the emperor was in 10 30

557
00:34:30.231 --> 00:34:33.440
to Conrad Incorporated Burgundy into his domain.

558
00:34:33.620 --> 00:34:35.690
Though gained diplomatically at the top,

559
00:34:35.691 --> 00:34:40.370
the nations still had to be taken by force burgundy along with the kingdoms of

560
00:34:40.371 --> 00:34:44.810
Germany and Italy would form the base of the holy Roman Empire along with

561
00:34:44.811 --> 00:34:46.880
Bohemia.
Although that is a different story.

562
00:34:46.970 --> 00:34:51.560
The Holy Roman emperors though losing power slowly,
we're still at the time,

563
00:34:51.561 --> 00:34:53.540
perhaps the strongest men in Europe,

564
00:34:53.600 --> 00:34:58.220
but their power would soon be challenged again as the seeds of an inevitable

565
00:34:58.221 --> 00:35:02.480
conflict planted as far back as Charlemagne began to sprout a power struggle

566
00:35:02.481 --> 00:35:06.890
between the emperor and pope remembered as the investiture controversy.

567
00:35:07.100 --> 00:35:08.060
As you recall,

568
00:35:08.090 --> 00:35:12.140
the practice of using the church to keep a grasp over Germany and the whole

569
00:35:12.141 --> 00:35:16.730
empire dates back quite far in a country struggling with unity.

570
00:35:16.820 --> 00:35:20.060
The church was a centralizing unified force.

571
00:35:20.120 --> 00:35:25.010
Bishops typically held similar power as a German princess up to this point.

572
00:35:25.070 --> 00:35:28.880
Positions of power within the Church of Germany weren't handed out by the pope.

573
00:35:28.910 --> 00:35:33.050
They were handed out by the emperors to ensure the church loyalty to him.

574
00:35:33.170 --> 00:35:38.170
At times the emperor even felt he had the power to install or depose popes and

575
00:35:38.311 --> 00:35:42.180
turn.
Though the pope was the sole person who could crown a king,

576
00:35:42.270 --> 00:35:43.470
holy Roman emperor.

577
00:35:43.770 --> 00:35:48.570
The notion that a German king or any second of Lord should have this power was

578
00:35:48.571 --> 00:35:51.390
challenged by the Gregorian reform movement.

579
00:35:51.420 --> 00:35:55.710
This refers to a focus on reforms such as allowing the pope to be elected by a

580
00:35:55.711 --> 00:35:59.370
college of cardinals rather than appointed by the emperor and for the church to

581
00:35:59.371 --> 00:36:02.730
be responsible in handling the positions of its own officials.

582
00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:08.000
The reformers began in 10 56 not coincidentally at the same time of riot and

583
00:36:08.011 --> 00:36:11.190
conspiracy in Germany under the six year old King Heinrich,

584
00:36:11.191 --> 00:36:16.191
the fourth the situation escalated and 10 75 when Pope Gregory the seventh

585
00:36:16.321 --> 00:36:21.321
issued the Dick Tatas pop by asserting that the church was founded by God,

586
00:36:21.420 --> 00:36:26.250
that the pope alone can depose or in state bishops and that he may even depose

587
00:36:26.251 --> 00:36:27.060
emperors.

588
00:36:27.060 --> 00:36:31.500
Heinrich to fourth was not interested in complying with a list of rules that

589
00:36:31.501 --> 00:36:32.730
would undermine his power.

590
00:36:32.850 --> 00:36:37.470
He sent the pope a letter making his intentions quite clear that he intended to

591
00:36:37.471 --> 00:36:40.170
remove him.
Pope Gregory though was prepared.

592
00:36:40.260 --> 00:36:44.610
He soon announced that Heinrich the fourth was no longer king and excommunicated

593
00:36:44.640 --> 00:36:48.480
him from the church.
Heinrich prepare to move south to depose the pope,

594
00:36:48.510 --> 00:36:52.830
but he was prevented from doing so by native unrest is discontented.

595
00:36:52.831 --> 00:36:57.000
Subjects leapt at the opportunity to legally rebel against him and he was

596
00:36:57.001 --> 00:37:01.110
grounded by civil war with his subjects who had the support of the pope fearing

597
00:37:01.111 --> 00:37:01.680
the feet.

598
00:37:01.680 --> 00:37:06.420
And 10 77 at the city of Canosa in the famous walk to Canosa,

599
00:37:06.480 --> 00:37:07.470
Heinrich marshed,

600
00:37:07.471 --> 00:37:12.240
barefoot in Fenton clothing through the snow to see the pope where he waited in

601
00:37:12.241 --> 00:37:17.130
fasted for three days at the castle gates until Pope Gregory finally received

602
00:37:17.131 --> 00:37:17.430
him.

603
00:37:17.430 --> 00:37:22.080
This act was humiliating to say the least Heinrich's predecessors could make or

604
00:37:22.081 --> 00:37:25.140
break a pope with a wave their hands.
Now you're,

605
00:37:25.141 --> 00:37:28.350
he was begging to one for his kingdom.
Nevertheless,

606
00:37:28.410 --> 00:37:31.680
Heinrich was forgiven and his excommunication was lifted.

607
00:37:31.740 --> 00:37:34.260
His relationship with the pope had been improved,

608
00:37:34.290 --> 00:37:37.530
but the German nobles weren't so forgiving.
Rather,

609
00:37:37.531 --> 00:37:42.531
they had designs to continue the great sex and revolt as it is called and elect

610
00:37:42.631 --> 00:37:44.910
a new King Rudolph on Ryan Feldman.

611
00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:48.690
The revolt would continue and in 10 80 things seem to get worse.

612
00:37:48.691 --> 00:37:52.920
When Pope Gregory took the side of Rudolf and ex communicated Heinrich again

613
00:37:53.070 --> 00:37:57.060
this time,
however,
Heinrich with prepared and he received a stroke of luck,

614
00:37:57.180 --> 00:37:58.770
Rudolph would die that year.

615
00:37:58.800 --> 00:38:03.140
The following year with the rebellion waning invaded Rome as Heinrich Marsh.

616
00:38:03.141 --> 00:38:08.010
Further,
the pope was forced to call on a new ally recruiting the Normans,

617
00:38:08.040 --> 00:38:12.810
who had recently occupied southern Italy and 10 84 they came to his rescue both

618
00:38:12.811 --> 00:38:15.930
when the populous of Rome revolted against Norman occupation.

619
00:38:16.050 --> 00:38:19.920
Norman's plundered and burned much of the city pole.
Gregory had one.

620
00:38:19.921 --> 00:38:20.610
There's a port,

621
00:38:20.610 --> 00:38:25.080
but now Rome opposed them and he had to leave with the Normans to return south

622
00:38:25.081 --> 00:38:26.580
where he died.
A year later,

623
00:38:26.640 --> 00:38:31.170
Heinrich VUSs elevated his choice for Pope Clement the third who crowned him

624
00:38:31.171 --> 00:38:35.070
holy Roman emperor.
This would not end the conflict,
however,

625
00:38:35.140 --> 00:38:40.140
and in fact the conflict but not end until 1122 when Heinrich son Heinrich's at

626
00:38:40.181 --> 00:38:45.100
FIS who had often imposes father in fact signs the Concorde it a Vermes with

627
00:38:45.101 --> 00:38:48.550
Pope Callixtus.
The second the church had effectively one,

628
00:38:48.551 --> 00:38:51.430
it's right to greater power and independence.

629
00:38:51.490 --> 00:38:54.220
This conflict Delta great blow cause the holy Roman Empire.

630
00:38:54.250 --> 00:38:58.570
It saw the power of the papacy grow and the power of the empire began to weaken

631
00:38:58.660 --> 00:39:00.400
as the nobility had resisted.

632
00:39:00.401 --> 00:39:04.450
The power of the MODOC for so long in Germany that contradicting him was

633
00:39:04.451 --> 00:39:05.320
commonplace.

634
00:39:05.360 --> 00:39:10.360
Big Concept of separatism was greatly favored in northern Italy and to the West.

635
00:39:10.420 --> 00:39:12.940
Amid this chaos and insubordination,

636
00:39:12.970 --> 00:39:15.890
the English and French were beginning to supplant the empire.

637
00:39:15.891 --> 00:39:19.750
His position as the leading power in Europe though the church had gained an

638
00:39:19.751 --> 00:39:24.751
upper hand and though the title of Holy Roman emperor was still not an inherited

639
00:39:24.791 --> 00:39:27.190
title,
rather one,
granted it's solely by the pope,

640
00:39:27.310 --> 00:39:31.600
it would not be the end over the debate of who is ultimately more powerful

641
00:39:31.900 --> 00:39:35.420
emperor or pope get into this period of history.

642
00:39:35.421 --> 00:39:40.340
I suppose I should preface the holy Roman Empire to try to make it clearer to

643
00:39:40.341 --> 00:39:45.341
understand a lot of people find the history and structure of the holy Roman

644
00:39:45.920 --> 00:39:49.700
Empire to be bizarre and confusing and if it seems that way,

645
00:39:49.940 --> 00:39:51.950
it's essentially because it is.

646
00:39:52.430 --> 00:39:57.080
Even foreigners around it at the same time remarked that it was excessively

647
00:39:57.081 --> 00:39:58.820
complicated and confusing.

648
00:39:59.060 --> 00:40:03.380
We of course saw the auto [inaudible] is trying to consolidate power around the

649
00:40:03.381 --> 00:40:07.850
monarchy and the salients held a good degree of power until the investiture

650
00:40:07.851 --> 00:40:08.990
controversy as well.

651
00:40:09.020 --> 00:40:13.460
But this problem of a lack of centralized authority does not get much better

652
00:40:13.461 --> 00:40:17.960
over time and truth except for a few intervals.
It gets worse.

653
00:40:18.110 --> 00:40:22.640
The emperor is don't really wield true unchallenged authority over everyone.

654
00:40:22.700 --> 00:40:27.050
They are in regular conflict with the nobility and other forces of power in the

655
00:40:27.051 --> 00:40:28.910
country like a church and cities,

656
00:40:28.940 --> 00:40:33.290
and this feature kind of prevents it from unifying into a cohesive nation state.

657
00:40:33.680 --> 00:40:36.050
In France and England for example,

658
00:40:36.080 --> 00:40:40.400
we can see clear centralization of power,
a clear chain of command,

659
00:40:40.430 --> 00:40:44.840
cohesion among the organs of the nation.
It's not always perfect,
but it works.

660
00:40:44.930 --> 00:40:47.720
That doesn't happen with the holy Roman Empire.

661
00:40:47.780 --> 00:40:52.700
It exists as a kind of loose union of microstates with too much autonomy to

662
00:40:52.701 --> 00:40:56.390
really get the nation off its feet and moving as a real empire.

663
00:40:56.420 --> 00:41:01.160
The micro states later have their own armies,
currencies,
laws,
that sort of thing.

664
00:41:01.220 --> 00:41:05.240
And this is interesting because throughout the upcoming period of history,

665
00:41:05.330 --> 00:41:09.490
Germany should have been a major power to rival France,
England,

666
00:41:09.500 --> 00:41:10.910
Spain later on.
However,

667
00:41:10.911 --> 00:41:14.930
a number of bizarre circumstances prevented the power within the country from

668
00:41:14.931 --> 00:41:18.260
being harnessed,
and that doesn't change until much later.

669
00:41:18.350 --> 00:41:23.180
Not to say that this was some sort of failed state.
However,
it was unusual,

670
00:41:23.300 --> 00:41:25.760
but it did last for a thousand years,

671
00:41:25.761 --> 00:41:30.650
which suggests that there is a method to the madness which we shall see as the

672
00:41:30.651 --> 00:41:34.610
Christian world came under threat by Islamic of the Holy Land.

673
00:41:34.610 --> 00:41:37.280
<v 0>Around the same time as the investiture controversy,</v>

674
00:41:37.340 --> 00:41:40.490
Germany finding itself greatly wounded by these events,

675
00:41:40.670 --> 00:41:44.000
participated very little on the first crusade.
Rather,

676
00:41:44.030 --> 00:41:48.080
it fell in a period of relative isolation.
In 1125 Heinrich,

677
00:41:48.081 --> 00:41:52.400
the fifth died childless as the last ruler of the salient dentisty.

678
00:41:52.460 --> 00:41:53.270
Accordingly,

679
00:41:53.270 --> 00:41:57.830
Conrad of the whole hinged off and dentisty eventually came to the throne after

680
00:41:57.831 --> 00:42:02.831
attempts to prevent him and an interregnum and 1152 Conrad's nephew Friedrich

681
00:42:03.230 --> 00:42:04.130
was elected king.

682
00:42:04.220 --> 00:42:08.210
One of Friedrich's first acts was to begin campaigning in Italy.

683
00:42:08.300 --> 00:42:12.890
Subduing the independent minded northern Italians,
the Melanie's in particulare.

684
00:42:12.920 --> 00:42:16.880
Eventually he reached Rome where he was crowned Holy Roman emperor.

685
00:42:16.940 --> 00:42:17.930
While in Italy,

686
00:42:18.020 --> 00:42:22.160
Friedrich would be given a name by which he is better known to this day red

687
00:42:22.161 --> 00:42:26.420
beard or an Italian barber.
Rossa.
Shortly thereafter,

688
00:42:26.450 --> 00:42:29.000
Barbara Rossa married Beatrice of Burgundy,

689
00:42:29.060 --> 00:42:32.870
securing his rule over all three main components of the empire.

690
00:42:32.871 --> 00:42:34.430
One's more on their wedding.

691
00:42:34.460 --> 00:42:38.960
They engaged in a ritual which today may seem unusual to us.

692
00:42:39.050 --> 00:42:42.530
Their marriage,
which was a greatly political event,

693
00:42:42.620 --> 00:42:47.620
was consummated in front of many important figures and foreign representatives.

694
00:42:48.440 --> 00:42:52.430
Thankfully,
the details of this event were meticulously recorded,

695
00:42:52.460 --> 00:42:54.020
which I shall now narrate to you.

696
00:42:54.110 --> 00:42:58.730
Barbarosa would spend much visceral struggling with Italy and the Pope Alexander

697
00:42:58.731 --> 00:42:59.420
the third.

698
00:42:59.420 --> 00:43:04.420
This struggle in fact was to lead to the placement of holy in the term holy

699
00:43:04.461 --> 00:43:09.461
Roman Empire or Sacrum and Pentium Romano and Latin Heidi Degas remissions

700
00:43:09.501 --> 00:43:14.480
writes in German,
the term holy was not meant to show fidelity to the pope.

701
00:43:14.690 --> 00:43:15.350
Rather,

702
00:43:15.350 --> 00:43:18.950
it was added to show in the pendants from him implying that the position of

703
00:43:18.951 --> 00:43:21.380
emperor was not some reward from the church.

704
00:43:21.440 --> 00:43:24.920
It was a position handed by God directly to the emperor.

705
00:43:24.950 --> 00:43:29.390
Without the Pope's involvement.
Barbarosa would campaign in Italy five times.

706
00:43:29.510 --> 00:43:32.660
He had goals to extend control all the way to Sicily,

707
00:43:32.720 --> 00:43:37.160
but in the end he was defeated by the Lombard League and alliance of many

708
00:43:37.161 --> 00:43:41.300
rebellious states of northern Italy as well as the Pope Venice,
Sicily,

709
00:43:41.320 --> 00:43:43.900
and the Byzantines at the battle of [inaudible].

710
00:43:44.060 --> 00:43:47.990
Barbarosa would also have to deal with power struggles at home as well.

711
00:43:48.080 --> 00:43:49.940
His cousin Heinrich,
their liver,

712
00:43:49.970 --> 00:43:54.970
Henry the Lion Duke of Bavaria and Saxony was an increasingly powerful

713
00:43:55.311 --> 00:43:57.440
individual in his territory's.

714
00:43:57.441 --> 00:44:01.310
He was keenly interested in founding cities and expanding his power.

715
00:44:01.490 --> 00:44:06.490
One such city and Bavaria was a town called mention home of the monks today,

716
00:44:06.951 --> 00:44:08.180
the city of Munich,

717
00:44:08.270 --> 00:44:12.380
which remains as Bavaria's capital along with Bavaria and Saxony,

718
00:44:12.440 --> 00:44:15.410
high north of lion,
also pressed East and the Slavic Lens,

719
00:44:15.490 --> 00:44:18.860
a holy mission to convert the Slavs and Baltic peoples.

720
00:44:18.920 --> 00:44:23.690
The last year a peon pagans to Christianity also presented an opportunity for

721
00:44:23.691 --> 00:44:28.490
Germans of all social status to expand eastward into sparsely inhabited and

722
00:44:28.491 --> 00:44:32.100
undeveloped lands.
This expansion,
which would last

723
00:44:32.100 --> 00:44:36.810
<v 1>for centuries,
is collectively referred to as Aussie Cielo.
The East is settling.</v>

724
00:44:37.020 --> 00:44:41.160
The all seed long would soon evolve into a lesser known chapter of the Crusades,

725
00:44:41.370 --> 00:44:45.960
one which prominently featured Germans and Germany,
the northern Crusades,

726
00:44:46.020 --> 00:44:48.870
as well as Danes,
Swedes and holes,
Heinrich.

727
00:44:48.871 --> 00:44:52.440
The lines power would increase the point of him being able to challenge

728
00:44:52.450 --> 00:44:55.890
Barbarossa,
even refusing to campaign with them in Italy.

729
00:44:56.310 --> 00:44:58.410
Barbarossa viewing this as treachery,

730
00:44:58.440 --> 00:45:02.010
stripped him of his titles and exiled him for some time to England.

731
00:45:02.070 --> 00:45:06.870
This did not solve the lack of cohesion among his nation at home and abroad that

732
00:45:06.871 --> 00:45:07.980
he was facing.
However,

733
00:45:08.010 --> 00:45:12.360
Barbara Rose's last campaign would be the third crusade where he endeavored to

734
00:45:12.361 --> 00:45:16.950
reclaim the holy land from the Muslim invaders in tandem with the French King

735
00:45:16.951 --> 00:45:21.270
Phillip Augustus and the English King Richard the Lionheart before he could

736
00:45:21.271 --> 00:45:23.070
reach the Holy Land.
However,

737
00:45:23.100 --> 00:45:27.960
in 1190 Barbarosa fell off his horse into a river where he drowned to death.

738
00:45:27.990 --> 00:45:30.120
He was succeeded by his son,
Heinrich,

739
00:45:30.121 --> 00:45:34.740
who became Heinrich the sixth he would rule for seven years during which time he

740
00:45:34.741 --> 00:45:38.580
expanded the empire all the way to Sicily territorial claim,

741
00:45:38.581 --> 00:45:39.750
which concern the pope.

742
00:45:39.810 --> 00:45:44.810
He died in 1197 his son Frederick was only three at a time and the throne became

743
00:45:45.721 --> 00:45:48.240
disputed as to kings were elected.
Heinrich,

744
00:45:48.241 --> 00:45:51.330
the sixth brother fill up the first and Heinrich,

745
00:45:51.331 --> 00:45:56.331
the lions son out of the fourth civil war erupted and continued until Friedrich

746
00:45:56.551 --> 00:45:58.920
a second came of age.
When he did,

747
00:45:58.950 --> 00:46:02.910
he won the pope's support by promising to let go of Sicily and me came

748
00:46:02.911 --> 00:46:07.911
undisputed king in 1215 he won the support of his nobles by doing what his

749
00:46:08.101 --> 00:46:13.050
predecessors has struggled in vain against granted the nobility further rights,

750
00:46:13.051 --> 00:46:17.310
and in the pendants,
Friedrich is remembered as a rather bright,
in fact,

751
00:46:17.311 --> 00:46:19.380
intellectual king,
Friedrich Nietzsche.

752
00:46:19.381 --> 00:46:23.550
I would later refer to him as the first European speaking of Sicily.

753
00:46:23.580 --> 00:46:26.580
Despite his promise to the pope,
he did not release it.

754
00:46:26.610 --> 00:46:30.540
He was actually able to form a strong effect of centralized government there.

755
00:46:30.660 --> 00:46:32.520
This anger the pope.
Furthermore,

756
00:46:32.670 --> 00:46:36.900
Friedrich was crown promising that he would embark on a crusade which she had

757
00:46:36.901 --> 00:46:39.300
thus far failed to do as well.
In fact,

758
00:46:39.330 --> 00:46:43.740
his hesitation to embark on the fifth crusade is often cited as the reason for

759
00:46:43.741 --> 00:46:44.574
its failure.

760
00:46:44.670 --> 00:46:48.270
Friedrich would be excommunicated four times throughout his life and his

761
00:46:48.271 --> 00:46:51.570
struggles with the papacy even being called the antichrist.

762
00:46:51.571 --> 00:46:56.040
On one occasion by Pope Gregory the Ninth Friedrich would embark on a crusade.

763
00:46:56.041 --> 00:46:57.570
However,
two in fact,

764
00:46:57.870 --> 00:47:02.310
the sixth crusade where he miraculously one Jerusalem by negotiation,

765
00:47:02.520 --> 00:47:05.490
which the pope hoping for a great battle wasn't happy about.

766
00:47:05.640 --> 00:47:07.830
And of course the northern Crusades,

767
00:47:07.890 --> 00:47:12.090
Friedrich had elevated Herrmann von Salsa to beat the grandmaster of the

768
00:47:12.091 --> 00:47:17.091
Teutonic order around 1210 the Teutonic knights would be key to expanding into

769
00:47:17.371 --> 00:47:20.610
territory such as of the Bonia and crusher.
In fact,

770
00:47:20.700 --> 00:47:24.240
they had been granted permission to rule over the pagan territories,

771
00:47:24.270 --> 00:47:25.170
which they conquered.

772
00:47:25.260 --> 00:47:29.770
The Teutonic orders rule over the territory of Prussia would lead to massive

773
00:47:29.771 --> 00:47:32.920
German migration and the German ization of the people there,

774
00:47:32.950 --> 00:47:36.760
which would have long term effects on German and European history.

775
00:47:36.820 --> 00:47:41.470
Friedrich's Ryan became greatly unstable in the 1240s as the papacy fought

776
00:47:41.471 --> 00:47:44.380
against him and engineered plots to overthrow him.

777
00:47:44.410 --> 00:47:48.100
Notably with an archbishop support of two different rival kings,

778
00:47:48.160 --> 00:47:51.610
they'll helm Poland and Henry Rusbay.
Meanwhile,

779
00:47:51.670 --> 00:47:56.470
the Teutonic order was taking on the far reaches of the Mongol army and the

780
00:47:56.471 --> 00:47:59.500
middle of the struggle and 1250 Friedrich died.

781
00:47:59.680 --> 00:48:03.880
His son died only a few years later ending Ho hinged off in rural.

782
00:48:04.150 --> 00:48:08.860
The Holy Roman empire was effectively entering into it's first grade interregnum

783
00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:13.960
or no king was able to receive on the spewed at approval until 1272 though

784
00:48:13.961 --> 00:48:18.760
confusion and uncertainty would last longer than us in both the empire and the

785
00:48:18.761 --> 00:48:19.390
Pepsi.

786
00:48:19.390 --> 00:48:23.690
The power of the nobility and bishops only fed off this increasing their power

787
00:48:23.691 --> 00:48:28.090
in cementing their autonomy with each Nobel commonly building his own castle to

788
00:48:28.091 --> 00:48:29.980
cement his authority.
In this time period,

789
00:48:30.010 --> 00:48:33.490
Germany is today one of the most castled regions in the world,

790
00:48:33.520 --> 00:48:36.250
despite a major lack of central authority.
However,

791
00:48:36.400 --> 00:48:39.340
the German kingdom would continue and many of its endeavors,

792
00:48:39.400 --> 00:48:43.870
including the push eastward,
which was less effected by Home Affairs.
Ahmed,

793
00:48:43.871 --> 00:48:46.330
this confusion and the vision.
A Rosa House,

794
00:48:46.331 --> 00:48:50.470
which would come to be one of the most important in the holy Roman Empire,

795
00:48:50.530 --> 00:48:55.530
and one of the most influential houses and European history from the arch Duchy

796
00:48:55.541 --> 00:48:56.374
of Austria,

797
00:48:56.410 --> 00:49:00.730
which has split off from a varia in a 12th century came the Habsburgs.

798
00:49:00.760 --> 00:49:05.260
The first Habsburg to be elected king was Rudolph the first though King of

799
00:49:05.261 --> 00:49:07.990
Germany,
he would not be holy Roman emperor.

800
00:49:08.080 --> 00:49:11.170
The ecclesiastical and sec of the is during this time,

801
00:49:11.171 --> 00:49:13.300
we're not interested in a leader.

802
00:49:13.330 --> 00:49:17.110
They were interested in a servant and we're more resilient than ever towards the

803
00:49:17.111 --> 00:49:19.480
king's attempts to rule them accordingly.

804
00:49:19.510 --> 00:49:21.670
This was not the Habsburgs rise to power.

805
00:49:21.760 --> 00:49:25.990
It was only temporary foreshadowing as it would be some time before they had a

806
00:49:25.991 --> 00:49:29.470
permanent hold on Germany.
The Habsburgs lost power in Germany.

807
00:49:29.471 --> 00:49:30.580
After Rudolph though,

808
00:49:30.581 --> 00:49:34.750
he had established his family by making his sons that dukes of Austria and

809
00:49:34.751 --> 00:49:37.930
Steria,
the German electors fearing the power of the house,

810
00:49:37.960 --> 00:49:40.270
thus elected kings from different houses,

811
00:49:40.330 --> 00:49:44.440
some of whom were chosen specifically because they lacked power and would be

812
00:49:44.441 --> 00:49:46.570
weak rulers from the surface.

813
00:49:46.600 --> 00:49:50.260
This arrangement of things probably appears who have a greatly favor of the

814
00:49:50.261 --> 00:49:52.270
princess.
However,
in turn,

815
00:49:52.300 --> 00:49:56.530
the princess found themselves struggling to maintain rural over there domains

816
00:49:56.531 --> 00:50:01.531
and the nobility church nights and cities within them who often acted

817
00:50:01.571 --> 00:50:02.890
independently as well.

818
00:50:03.130 --> 00:50:07.600
The cities in Germany in particular and his time period operated fairly

819
00:50:07.601 --> 00:50:11.320
independently.
They weren't exactly cities states like in Italy,

820
00:50:11.350 --> 00:50:15.970
but they weren't always subservient to the surrounding country and oftentimes

821
00:50:15.971 --> 00:50:18.550
they banded together to promote their own interest.

822
00:50:18.730 --> 00:50:23.020
One example of this is the Honda diotic league from the German word [inaudible],

823
00:50:23.050 --> 00:50:23.950
which means guilt,

824
00:50:23.951 --> 00:50:28.190
which was both a trading and also at offensively administered by German

825
00:50:28.191 --> 00:50:32.540
merchants extending from London to Novgorod by the 15th century.

826
00:50:32.570 --> 00:50:35.120
Some of these cities became imperial cities,

827
00:50:35.150 --> 00:50:39.380
which were effectively as autonomous as other parts of the country.
Heinrich.

828
00:50:39.381 --> 00:50:44.381
The seventh was crown king in 1308 becoming holy Roman emperor and 1312 during

829
00:50:45.111 --> 00:50:48.950
his reign,
the Teutonic knights capture the city of Gdansk or in German,

830
00:50:48.980 --> 00:50:51.740
Don's linking Germany and Prussia geographically.

831
00:50:51.860 --> 00:50:55.550
Heinrich died a few years into his reign though and was succeeded by his son

832
00:50:55.580 --> 00:50:58.070
Ludvig that forests in a contested election.

833
00:50:58.250 --> 00:51:01.310
The pope furthermore refuse to acknowledge his claims,

834
00:51:01.340 --> 00:51:06.340
but in 1338 the German electors agreed to the declaration of runs a.

835
00:51:06.920 --> 00:51:10.560
In this declaration they stated that the right of the emperor to rural,

836
00:51:10.561 --> 00:51:13.580
it was no longer dependent on the pope's approval.

837
00:51:13.640 --> 00:51:18.230
Whomever the electors chose to be king would be king and with the title of King

838
00:51:18.290 --> 00:51:22.490
automatically came the title of Holy Roman emperor or in German,

839
00:51:22.520 --> 00:51:27.260
Kaiser from the Latin Chi's are,
or as we more commonly pronounced it Caesar.

840
00:51:27.380 --> 00:51:32.380
This decision later paved the way for the golden bowl of 1356 to be issued under

841
00:51:33.021 --> 00:51:37.610
Carl fourth who is also king of Bohemia and a part of the house of Luxembourg

842
00:51:37.700 --> 00:51:40.280
beginning his reign as well as the reign of his house.

843
00:51:40.281 --> 00:51:45.281
In 1346 the golden bowl finally solidified and organize the process by which

844
00:51:46.671 --> 00:51:48.230
emperors would be elected.

845
00:51:48.410 --> 00:51:53.000
The emperors would be elected by seven career footsteps or prince electors.

846
00:51:53.090 --> 00:51:56.510
Three of them were ecclesiastical.
The Archbishop of minds,

847
00:51:56.570 --> 00:52:01.280
the Archbishop of Cologne and the Archbishop of trior for were secular,

848
00:52:01.340 --> 00:52:04.430
the king of Bohemia,
the counts Palatine of the Rhine,

849
00:52:04.580 --> 00:52:08.390
the Duke of Saxony Vandenberg,
and the Margrave of Brandenburg.

850
00:52:08.450 --> 00:52:12.650
The Golden Bowl is a times referred to as the German magna Carta.

851
00:52:12.800 --> 00:52:17.060
These changes marked the beginning of a new identity for the holy Roman Empire.

852
00:52:17.090 --> 00:52:21.440
It would end or attempt to end constant civil war has caused by succession

853
00:52:21.441 --> 00:52:23.660
debates,
but in truth to a degree,

854
00:52:24.050 --> 00:52:29.000
it was a significant milestone on the empire's gradual path toward irrelevancy.

855
00:52:29.030 --> 00:52:33.020
The empire had lost its vision of being a universal Christian Empire.

856
00:52:33.110 --> 00:52:35.720
The emperor's,
we're now dependent on the electors.

857
00:52:35.780 --> 00:52:40.760
This would greatly impede his ability to project power beyond its own borders.

858
00:52:40.910 --> 00:52:43.640
Around the same time that these changes were occurring,

859
00:52:43.670 --> 00:52:45.800
Germany was invaded by a new enemy.

860
00:52:45.860 --> 00:52:50.860
The black death caused by three different strains of plague between 1347 and

861
00:52:51.381 --> 00:52:56.150
1351 it would kill around half of Europe's population.
Germany was,

862
00:52:56.151 --> 00:52:58.340
thankfully not hit quite as hard,

863
00:52:58.341 --> 00:53:02.900
but it was still dealt a heavy blow by losing 20% of its population.

864
00:53:02.990 --> 00:53:05.590
When Carl the fourth died,
his son wants a slouch,

865
00:53:05.600 --> 00:53:10.600
was elected in 1378 yet once this Laos was deposed by the electors in 1400 his

866
00:53:11.391 --> 00:53:15.230
behavior was seen as rather degenerate and is rural and effective.

867
00:53:15.440 --> 00:53:17.450
Though he did remain king of Bohemia,

868
00:53:17.630 --> 00:53:21.740
he was replaced by a roof racks the third as long as once it stops lived.

869
00:53:21.741 --> 00:53:22.370
However,

870
00:53:22.370 --> 00:53:26.850
Rupe Rex rain was contested and domestic conflict was a feature throughout his

871
00:53:26.851 --> 00:53:31.851
reign on the verge of civil war and 1410 we're prek died and the ones this Laos

872
00:53:32.131 --> 00:53:36.240
wanted the throne it would pass to his younger brother.
Sigismund as men,

873
00:53:36.241 --> 00:53:40.500
was a bright and energetic man and was in fact already king of Hungary.

874
00:53:40.590 --> 00:53:44.430
He had spent considerable time campaigning against the Muslim Ottomans as the

875
00:53:44.431 --> 00:53:47.190
head of the order of the Dragon Sigismund.

876
00:53:47.240 --> 00:53:51.090
Early rain was marked by handling a large number of affairs.

877
00:53:51.150 --> 00:53:53.040
He would go to war with the Venetians.

878
00:53:53.070 --> 00:53:57.090
He would be very much involved in the two tonic Polish wars interrupting to the

879
00:53:57.091 --> 00:54:00.300
northeast,
and he would help and the papal schism,

880
00:54:00.390 --> 00:54:04.380
a dispute which had divided the church among three competing pope's.

881
00:54:04.440 --> 00:54:09.440
He would do this with his suggestion of the Council of Constance at the council

882
00:54:09.690 --> 00:54:10.380
of Constance as well.

883
00:54:10.380 --> 00:54:14.340
The matter of a Catholic priest named Aeon whois was addressed.

884
00:54:14.370 --> 00:54:19.370
Yon whois was a Bohemian or check reformer who had wanted to change the behavior

885
00:54:19.531 --> 00:54:23.340
and practices in the Catholic Church and a time when it's schism was

886
00:54:23.341 --> 00:54:24.420
deteriorating.

887
00:54:24.421 --> 00:54:28.860
It's image whois wasn't tolerated and he was burned at the stake.

888
00:54:28.861 --> 00:54:32.880
And 1415 and constants,
despite Sigismund is a vow of protection.

889
00:54:33.060 --> 00:54:35.730
This would not end the discontent,
however,

890
00:54:35.910 --> 00:54:39.900
rather it would enrage it as many checks and favorite hoose and viewed him.

891
00:54:39.901 --> 00:54:43.200
Now as a martyr public unrest brewed in Bohemia,

892
00:54:43.230 --> 00:54:48.230
which evolved into civil war in 1419 once a Laos died and Sigismund came to the

893
00:54:48.631 --> 00:54:50.160
throne of Bohemia as well,

894
00:54:50.220 --> 00:54:53.910
declaring that he would drown all the hussite heretics.

895
00:54:53.940 --> 00:54:58.890
In 1421 the pope escalated the situation by calling a crusade against the host

896
00:54:58.891 --> 00:54:59.131
site,

897
00:54:59.131 --> 00:55:03.930
checks the hood sites weren't pushovers the conflict that was emerging with last

898
00:55:03.931 --> 00:55:07.230
for years,
and they in fact took the flight to Germany,
Hungary,

899
00:55:07.231 --> 00:55:12.120
and the two tonic lands where they aligned themselves with the Polish and the

900
00:55:12.120 --> 00:55:15.180
Polish Teutonic war of 1431 35 the host sites themselves,

901
00:55:15.181 --> 00:55:18.690
however soon split into separate branches and the requests,

902
00:55:18.720 --> 00:55:21.300
the more moderate of the two were victorious.

903
00:55:21.480 --> 00:55:24.960
The war ended in 1434 with a mix of results.

904
00:55:25.050 --> 00:55:27.420
Neither side was really victorious.

905
00:55:27.540 --> 00:55:30.210
The host sites were reincorporated into Bohemia,

906
00:55:30.300 --> 00:55:33.600
but they were allowed to continue practicing some of their religious Gleaves.

907
00:55:33.690 --> 00:55:35.730
Sigismund died the following year.

908
00:55:36.090 --> 00:55:39.900
His successor would be Friedrich to third from the House of Habsburg,

909
00:55:39.960 --> 00:55:43.680
another house he Hohenzollern had gained power in Brandenburg,

910
00:55:43.681 --> 00:55:47.130
Prussia with the compromise between the Hussites and Catholics.

911
00:55:47.190 --> 00:55:50.730
More radical church reform would be delayed by a century,

912
00:55:50.910 --> 00:55:52.500
but it was coming.

913
00:55:52.710 --> 00:55:57.120
Reform which would rock Christianity in Europe to its core will be sparked under

914
00:55:57.121 --> 00:56:00.630
a German monk named Martin Luther.
In the next video,

915
00:56:00.660 --> 00:56:04.800
we will see where all this leads and learn how Germany copes with the rise of

916
00:56:04.801 --> 00:56:07.860
Protestantism and later the beginnings of modern Europe.

917
00:56:07.890 --> 00:56:12.240
We will explore the roles of the Austrian impression empires,
Napoleon's empire,

918
00:56:12.450 --> 00:56:16.710
the unification of Germany,
the world wars,
and the modern nation of today.

919
00:56:16.830 --> 00:56:18.510
I hope you've enjoyed this video.

00:56:18.570 --> 00:56:22.440

Fire of learning does take donations on patrion linked to which you can find in

926
00:56:37.931 --> 00:56:40.990
the description.
The patrion was down for a little bit,

927
00:56:40.991 --> 00:56:44.800
