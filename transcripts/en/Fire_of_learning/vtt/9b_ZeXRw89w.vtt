Hello and welcome the fire of learning.

2
00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:06.660
Did you know that domesticated foxes exist,
which may be kept as pets?
Well,

3
00:00:06.661 --> 00:00:09.840
with some of the cool and exotic animals people are keeping as pets these days

4
00:00:09.841 --> 00:00:13.890
perhaps is not that surprising to you.
However,
these are not simply normal foxes.

5
00:00:13.891 --> 00:00:18.891
The Russian domesticated Red Fox is a Fox intentionally bred to be friendly to

6
00:00:19.141 --> 00:00:22.950
humans and it's story provides a fascinating insight into how to breeding or

7
00:00:22.951 --> 00:00:25.410
more technically artificials election works.

8
00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.900
It all began almost 60 years ago in the Soviet Union with Russian scientist

9
00:00:29.901 --> 00:00:32.680
Dimitri belly of.
During this time period,

10
00:00:32.681 --> 00:00:37.140
the Soviet Union held onto a moderately anti scientific ideology known as

11
00:00:37.141 --> 00:00:38.050
Lysenko Wisdom,

12
00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.480
which stood in contrast to belly gabs work as it was largely against classical

13
00:00:42.481 --> 00:00:44.040
genetics and things of that nature,

14
00:00:44.041 --> 00:00:47.310
which we now understand to be scientifically true.
As a result of this,

15
00:00:47.311 --> 00:00:51.660
he lost his job with the department of for animal breeding at the Central

16
00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.850
Research Laboratory and Moscow.
This did not face him.
However,

17
00:00:53.851 --> 00:00:57.840
and despite Soviet persecution of Darwinism and modern genetic research,

18
00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.580
he continued his work though in private Belia Yoav and other scientists of his

19
00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:03.870
day is such as Lou media truth.

20
00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:08.250
We're interested in subjects and questions of genetics such as how did humans

21
00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:09.450
tame dogs.

22
00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.230
These signs is sought to answer this question and in fact devise and experiment

23
00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.790
and in fact replication of the process using foxes and operating under the

24
00:01:17.791 --> 00:01:21.990
correct notion that animal behavior is influenced very much by genetics.

25
00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:25.320
These scientists believe that if they began with a group of foxes,

26
00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.970
about 30 male foxes and a hundred female Fox vixens as they're called and

27
00:01:29.971 --> 00:01:33.190
selectively chose to breathe the foxes which were friendliness,

28
00:01:33.191 --> 00:01:37.470
that over generations they would end up with a breed of Fox that was friendly

29
00:01:37.471 --> 00:01:39.060
towards humans.
Accordingly,

30
00:01:39.061 --> 00:01:43.050
they separated their foxes into three categories which persisted throughout the

31
00:01:43.051 --> 00:01:43.800
experiment.

32
00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:48.030
Category three consisted of foxes that were either scared of or aggressive

33
00:01:48.031 --> 00:01:48.840
towards humans.

34
00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.440
Category two were foxes who are not exactly aggressive or scared of humans,

35
00:01:52.441 --> 00:01:54.480
but we're not really eager to interact with them,

36
00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.280
and category one consisted of foxes who were friendlier towards humans

37
00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.770
displaying friendliness and openness to socialization researchers.

38
00:02:01.771 --> 00:02:05.280
We're careful not to train the foc as they had to let them develop naturally in

39
00:02:05.281 --> 00:02:09.030
order to be sure that the change towards friendliness was genetic and not

40
00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.140
environmental experiment as a scientist predicted actually had a considerable

41
00:02:13.141 --> 00:02:16.020
degree of success and by the sixth generation,

42
00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.420
the scientists had to add on a new class,

43
00:02:18.421 --> 00:02:21.360
the iie or the domesticated elite class.

44
00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:25.980
This group of foxes consisted of those who were essentially acting as modern

45
00:02:25.981 --> 00:02:28.230
dogs do,
being eager to interact with humans,

46
00:02:28.231 --> 00:02:31.830
having a general degree of friendliness,
enjoying socialization,
et Cetera,

47
00:02:31.831 --> 00:02:35.000
et cetera.
This process,
while having a remarkable results,

48
00:02:35.001 --> 00:02:39.180
seems pretty straightforward and in fact,
it kind of is so easy.
In fact,

49
00:02:39.181 --> 00:02:43.710
a caveman could do it and they did it as soon as process that we ended up with

50
00:02:43.711 --> 00:02:46.530
the modern dog and in fact,
many domestic animals today.

51
00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:48.030
Today though with modern techniques,

52
00:02:48.031 --> 00:02:52.530
they simply establish that behavior is largely genetic and selectively chose to

53
00:02:52.531 --> 00:02:55.410
reproduce the organisms which display that kind of behavior.

54
00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:56.680
And thankfully for the science,

55
00:02:56.681 --> 00:02:59.010
his behavior with something which is easy to observe,

56
00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:01.320
relatively easy to modify over generation.

57
00:03:01.321 --> 00:03:06.321
So it wasn't as complex as a trying to breed six legged or flying fox cause

58
00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:07.270
would be,

59
00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:10.780
that may take a considerable amount of time doing it the old fashioned way.

60
00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:11.650
Simple.

61
00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:15.310
But what was going on with the Fox is biologically that was responsible for this

62
00:03:15.311 --> 00:03:17.680
level and change of behavior.
Well,

63
00:03:17.681 --> 00:03:20.950
quite simply the way the Fox has produced hormones changed,

64
00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:25.480
but domestic foxes have lower levels of hormones like adrenaline than their wild

65
00:03:25.481 --> 00:03:28.570
counterparts do.
And this actually has some physical effects on them as well.

66
00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:30.850
For example,
the foxes for became spottier,

67
00:03:30.851 --> 00:03:35.500
like many species of dogs and their estrous cycle changed in the 1990s however,

68
00:03:35.501 --> 00:03:37.540
following the collapse of the Soviet Union,

69
00:03:37.541 --> 00:03:40.900
the project suffered financially and the researchers were actually forced to

70
00:03:40.901 --> 00:03:45.880
sell a number of the domesticated foxes going from 700 to 100 as of last report.

71
00:03:45.881 --> 00:03:46.211
However,

72
00:03:46.211 --> 00:03:50.410
the project is still running and is maintaining over 300 domesticated foxes.

73
00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:53.860
And so that is the story of the domesticated Fox.

74
00:03:53.861 --> 00:03:56.560
And perhaps one day if such projects take up again,

75
00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:59.860
that'll be coming to a pet store near you.
In my opinion,

76
00:03:59.861 --> 00:04:04.150
it's interesting to look into such studies and consider the possibilities of

77
00:04:04.151 --> 00:04:09.010
what organisms could be changed and into what the wide diversity of life on

78
00:04:09.011 --> 00:04:11.440
earth,
which are rose naturally including us,

79
00:04:11.441 --> 00:04:14.590
tells us that there is quite a number of possibilities.

80
00:04:14.591 --> 00:04:16.790
And when humans come to massive in an x,

81
00:04:16.791 --> 00:04:20.020
it will be interesting to see what we do with such capabilities.

82
00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:23.260
From what we do is like this and video is on many other subjects.

83
00:04:23.261 --> 00:04:27.220
