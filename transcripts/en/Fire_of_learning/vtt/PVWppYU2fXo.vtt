00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:02.220
Hello and welcome the fire of learning.

2
00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:05.520
So there's some confusion centered around this country.

3
00:00:05.521 --> 00:00:10.521
Here is this place called the Netherlands or Holland are the way that people

4
00:00:11.761 --> 00:00:15.060
aren't necessarily called Nederlanders or Hollander's,

5
00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:20.070
but they are in fact the Dutch.
Why is this so confusing?
Well,

6
00:00:20.071 --> 00:00:20.904
simply put,

7
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.170
the names are so odd because the region has had a very shifting and turbulent

8
00:00:25.171 --> 00:00:29.370
history.
The first point I want to make is that it's not really their fault.

9
00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:34.230
It's the fault of us English speakers in Dutch,
the word Dutch is near Lonza.

10
00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.400
The Dutch people are donated or launders and the country is Nader lawn,

11
00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.460
although occasionally the Dutch do call their country Holland.

12
00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.760
The second point is that the Danish,
the NHANES Denmark,

13
00:00:44.761 --> 00:00:48.720
everything from this country here is not related,
so don't get them confused.

14
00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.130
Now then,
what's the difference between the Netherlands and Holland?

15
00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.500
Well,
technically speaking,

16
00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.770
Holland refers to north and South Holland,

17
00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.190
the two most important provinces in the Netherlands,

18
00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:05.730
home to many important cities,
including the Capitol,
Amsterdam.

19
00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.470
This is similar to people at times referring to the United Kingdom as England,

20
00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:12.870
it has a times,
however,
been used correctly.

21
00:01:12.871 --> 00:01:17.040
Do describe the whole country as early as the 11th century in fact,

22
00:01:17.041 --> 00:01:21.690
and as recently as Napoleon renaming the country to the Kingdom of Holland to

23
00:01:21.691 --> 00:01:22.231
this day,

24
00:01:22.231 --> 00:01:25.410
and I said the Dutch still occasionally referred to their whole country as

25
00:01:25.411 --> 00:01:29.250
Holland and it's not completely incorrect to do so in English though not favored

26
00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.870
because there are of course 10 other provinces is sides north and south Holland

27
00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:34.950
within the country.

28
00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:40.250
The term the Netherlands means the low countries referring to the low altitude

29
00:01:40.321 --> 00:01:41.120
of the nation,

30
00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:44.910
though the term originally referred to a large region which include a Belgium

31
00:01:44.911 --> 00:01:47.760
and other parts of the area.
The name however,

32
00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:51.570
was eventually adopted as the national name of the Dutch republic.

33
00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:56.130
Speaking of which the Dutch,
the word Dutch shares a common origin.

34
00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:59.070
What the German word Dortch which means German.

35
00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:01.350
The old dramatic word say,
oh,

36
00:02:01.351 --> 00:02:05.400
disc meant simply the people and became Deutsche in German.

37
00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.580
Likewise,
the Danish and Swedish referred to Germans as tick.

38
00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:14.340
The Dutch people closely related to the other dramatic peoples of Europe were

39
00:02:14.341 --> 00:02:16.950
eventually called the Dutch by English speakers.

40
00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:20.580
Terms like deach were used by the Dutch and their own language to refer to

41
00:02:20.581 --> 00:02:24.600
themselves,
at least terms were eventually abandoned in favor of Nadir Lonza.

42
00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.290
Interestingly,
however,
the Pennsylvania Dutch,

43
00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:32.370
a group of Amish and Mennonites living in Pennsylvania,
I'm not actually Dutch,

44
00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:37.050
the German and the name is a remnant of a time when the words Dutch and

45
00:02:37.051 --> 00:02:37.530
Deutsche,

46
00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:41.040
we're not so very far apart and highlights the fact that they share a common

47
00:02:41.041 --> 00:02:45.900
origin.
Again,
referring to variations of dramatic words for people.

48
00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:49.140
And so that is the answer to these questions in a nutshell,

49
00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:51.570
to support the creation of more videos like these,

51
00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:58.530
any donation would be appreciated and be put to use to improve the channel.

52
