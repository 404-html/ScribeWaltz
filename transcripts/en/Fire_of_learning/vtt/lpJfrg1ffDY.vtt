Hello everyone today,

2
00:00:01.591 --> 00:00:05.940
a couple hours ago this channel hit 1000 subscribers and I just wanted to get on

3
00:00:05.941 --> 00:00:06.930
and say thank you.

4
00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:11.610
I'm very glad that you guys are liking is content and our offering own insights.

5
00:00:11.611 --> 00:00:15.990
I appreciate the advice and participation and support that you guys have given

6
00:00:15.991 --> 00:00:19.740
me throughout the road here.
It's definitely been an uphill road,

7
00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.770
you know compared to the videos that I was making back in the thought of his

8
00:00:22.771 --> 00:00:24.540
channel.
I think I've improved a lot.

9
00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.560
I'm proud of that improvement and I'm going to keep trying to improve and I

10
00:00:28.561 --> 00:00:33.420
think for now the best way to say thank you to you guys for viewing and

11
00:00:33.421 --> 00:00:37.800
subscribing to fire of learning is to keep it all going with the content that

12
00:00:37.801 --> 00:00:38.970
you guys came here for.

13
00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.170
I don't want to rehash the same videos and ideas of the rest of youtube is

14
00:00:43.171 --> 00:00:45.880
making,
I want this channel to be unique and awkward.

15
00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:49.650
His own insights and opera depth and perspective,
which is lacking on Youtube,

16
00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.720
which you guys seem to find interesting.

17
00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.770
And then he insights or opinions or video requests if you guys have will

18
00:00:55.771 --> 00:00:59.040
definitely help to that end as they have thus far.
