00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:01.770
Hello and welcome to fire of learning.

2
00:00:01.830 --> 00:00:05.340
In the last video we talked a little bit about the Scandinavian societies,

3
00:00:05.341 --> 00:00:09.330
which proceeded the Viking Age and looked at the events going on in Scandinavia

4
00:00:09.331 --> 00:00:11.340
and Europe,
which may have caused the Viking age,

5
00:00:11.341 --> 00:00:14.820
and of course in this video we're going to talk about the Viking age itself.

6
00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:19.350
So let's get into it.
Lindisfarne a small island off the coast of modern England.

7
00:00:19.351 --> 00:00:24.351
What was then North Umbria is a classic historical example of a sitting duck on

8
00:00:24.361 --> 00:00:28.680
this island was an isolated and undefended Abby hum to monks and filled with

9
00:00:28.681 --> 00:00:29.520
valuable goods.

10
00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:33.060
The fact that this Abby was somewhat isolated from the rest of the country was

11
00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.330
not an isolated occurrence.
A lot of churches and such things.

12
00:00:36.331 --> 00:00:40.290
We're trying to sort of settle away from the turbulent politics of their home

13
00:00:40.291 --> 00:00:44.490
nations and while isolation may have been indeed beneficial to that end,

14
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.620
it was very enticing of foreigners,

15
00:00:46.621 --> 00:00:49.350
particularly someone like the Vikings and in fact we see,

16
00:00:49.351 --> 00:00:51.510
especially in the earlier days of the Viking Age,

17
00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.590
the Viking specifically targeted these religious centers.
Possibly.

18
00:00:55.591 --> 00:00:59.250
This relates back to the idea that they may have actually been encouraged to

19
00:00:59.251 --> 00:01:02.460
find themselves and Christianity like we talked about in the last video,

20
00:01:02.461 --> 00:01:06.750
and also especially because such sites were considerably week and on either

21
00:01:06.751 --> 00:01:08.070
January or more lightly,

22
00:01:08.071 --> 00:01:13.071
June eight 793 the Viking age began here on that day to small group Vikings,

23
00:01:13.921 --> 00:01:18.030
perhaps 25 to 40 sale to Lindisfarne found it surprisingly vulnerable.

24
00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.900
The English king were far too occupied and worked with each other to suspect and

25
00:01:21.901 --> 00:01:23.700
prepare for an attack such as this.

26
00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.030
The Vikings rated the Abbey killing amongst present directly or throwing them

27
00:01:27.031 --> 00:01:30.510
into the ocean or enslaving them.
The English Saxon Chronicle,

28
00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.860
obviously with a bit of added fiction record to the event and this year fierce

29
00:01:34.861 --> 00:01:37.050
foreboding omens came over to the land of the north.

30
00:01:37.051 --> 00:01:40.650
Some brands and their wretched people shook their were excessive whirlwinds

31
00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.770
lightening and fiery dragons.
We're seeing flying in the sky.

32
00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:47.760
These signs were followed by great feminine and then a little after those,

33
00:01:47.761 --> 00:01:50.190
that same year on the sixth ides of January,

34
00:01:50.191 --> 00:01:54.210
the ravaging of wretched heathen people destroyed God's church at Linda's farm.

35
00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.930
It's certainly notable to mention that many prayers in England at this time

36
00:01:57.931 --> 00:02:02.160
ended up with the phrase from the fury of the Northmen deliver us,
oh Lord.

37
00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.520
More raids with can come and would grow in size and complexity.

38
00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:06.930
Scotland and Ireland.

39
00:02:06.931 --> 00:02:11.010
We're soon specifically preferred over England after the failed raid on the

40
00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:13.440
Jarrow Abby,
where the Viking graders were met with resistance.

41
00:02:13.441 --> 00:02:18.441
Though in time the vikings did come back for Jiro and England and general soon

42
00:02:18.481 --> 00:02:21.990
followed France,
Germany,
and Eastern Europe.
These rates,
however,

43
00:02:21.991 --> 00:02:24.600
we're not limited only to proximate locations in Europe,

44
00:02:24.601 --> 00:02:28.920
the Vikings would even begin to travel as far as the Middle East and Byzantine

45
00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:29.190
Empire.

46
00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:32.760
This reinforces the fact that these rays weren't just conducted by a bunch of

47
00:02:32.761 --> 00:02:36.300
drunk savages getting on a ship and then attack in the first building as they

48
00:02:36.301 --> 00:02:37.530
saw the vikings,

49
00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:40.950
the viking raids were often considerably well planned and got more and more

50
00:02:40.951 --> 00:02:44.910
complex.
As time went on,
Europe was terrified by the northbound.

51
00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:46.410
As I said earlier,
though,

52
00:02:46.411 --> 00:02:50.700
the vikings were not solely interested in just going on summer pillages and then

53
00:02:50.701 --> 00:02:52.740
coming home with all their bouncy.

54
00:02:52.741 --> 00:02:57.180
These raids did indeed yield great rewards and did in fact in many ways to find

55
00:02:57.181 --> 00:02:58.014
the vikings,

56
00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:02.350
but they were also considerably interested in settling and conquering places as

57
00:03:02.351 --> 00:03:06.790
well.
Not long after the raids became more popular and commonplace and Layton,

58
00:03:06.791 --> 00:03:11.050
ninth and 10th century biking colonization really took off in northern Scotland.

59
00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:15.160
Norwegian vikings settled Shetland Orkney and the Hebrides in Ireland.

60
00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:17.530
They founded settlements such as Wexford,
limerick,

61
00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:20.500
and in fact the modern capital of Ireland,
Dublin.

62
00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:24.840
Some colonies were established as rating outposts and evolved over time into

63
00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:28.240
actual settlements.
Many of them were largely comprised of men.

64
00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:31.720
Women were brought in the settlements from the surrounding country.
At times,

65
00:03:31.721 --> 00:03:35.200
conflict emerged between local inhabitants and the Viking settlers.

66
00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:38.290
At other times,
coexistence was entirely possible.

67
00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:41.110
Some Irish and Viking neighbors would go so far as a form.

68
00:03:41.111 --> 00:03:43.150
Alliances with each other and intermarry.

69
00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:47.740
England's interaction with the Vikings is of considerable importance and fame

70
00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:52.770
and eight 65 to three sons of the legendary Viking King Ragnar log groke eve are

71
00:03:52.841 --> 00:03:57.010
the bone lists Hoff dawn and Guth from let a force of Viking warriors into

72
00:03:57.011 --> 00:04:01.180
England,
which the Anglo Saxon is called Michael Hyphen Hara a great,

73
00:04:01.181 --> 00:04:03.460
he's an army is interesting by the way,

74
00:04:03.461 --> 00:04:06.040
how evidence of Ragnar is existence as a week.

75
00:04:06.041 --> 00:04:08.320
But these three people did in fact exist.

76
00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:13.300
So an eight 67 the vikings captured the city of York and thereby Asserta control

77
00:04:13.301 --> 00:04:14.650
over much of Northumbria.

78
00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:18.850
They continued to push into the island until age 78 when Alfred the great King

79
00:04:18.851 --> 00:04:22.780
of West six defeated them in battle saving England from total domination and

80
00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:25.480
naturally earning him the title,
the great,

81
00:04:25.481 --> 00:04:27.700
which is only shared with news degrade in England,

82
00:04:27.701 --> 00:04:31.240
North King in English history cause he agreed to a piece and established

83
00:04:31.241 --> 00:04:35.590
territories.
The agreed upon Norse territory is referred to as the Dane law,

84
00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:37.660
which was around until the 11th century.

85
00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:41.260
The presence of the Dane Law had a major effect on this part of history,

86
00:04:41.261 --> 00:04:45.490
some of which lasts until this day conflicts that occur between the English and

87
00:04:45.491 --> 00:04:46.001
the Vikings.

88
00:04:46.001 --> 00:04:49.870
But there were also times of peace during which trade and interactions of all

89
00:04:49.871 --> 00:04:50.710
sorts occurred.

90
00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:55.090
These associations had a considerable impact on English culture and history and

91
00:04:55.091 --> 00:04:57.790
in fact the English language we still,

92
00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:01.210
in fact he used Viking words to this day is bog dirt,

93
00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:05.680
run res Lake ill,
happy anger,
the Pronoun they,

94
00:05:05.681 --> 00:05:08.230
and importantly,
being a moderately democratic people.

95
00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:11.380
They gave us the word law as well as many other words,

96
00:05:11.381 --> 00:05:13.480
but we'll talk about that a little bit more.
And,
uh,

97
00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:16.690
upcoming video of Viking ways of life and language and religion,

98
00:05:16.691 --> 00:05:17.500
things like that.

99
00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:21.400
The French believed by some to be the original irritates of the vikings were not

100
00:05:21.401 --> 00:05:23.020
safe from the conquest either.

101
00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:27.190
Oftentimes the Frankish kings though better organized and offended at the time,

102
00:05:27.191 --> 00:05:30.700
then their English counterparts were unable to fend off Viking Raiders.

103
00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:33.550
Kings at such as Charles the bald and Charles is simple,

104
00:05:33.551 --> 00:05:35.620
simply tried to pay the vikings off.

105
00:05:35.621 --> 00:05:39.640
So these agreements were often very short lived as the vikings continuously came

106
00:05:39.641 --> 00:05:44.641
back from more in 911 the Viking leader rollup besieged Paris altogether.

107
00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:48.160
Charles is simple,
had no choice but to see territory,

108
00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:53.020
the Vikings Kleiner territory in north Manea or the land of the Northmen or

109
00:05:53.021 --> 00:05:57.040
today as it's known Normandy,
they settled in eastern Europe as well.

110
00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:00.840
The particularly warlike Slavic tribes in the region even welcomed,
uh,

111
00:06:00.841 --> 00:06:05.150
leadership of rubric and the Moravians Barrengi and being the word which the

112
00:06:05.151 --> 00:06:07.120
Greeks gave the vikings and therefore being,

113
00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:11.090
the word which is commonly used to refer to vikings in the east were Rick and

114
00:06:11.091 --> 00:06:13.310
his group of Viking is from around Sweden and founded,

115
00:06:13.311 --> 00:06:17.330
conquered and United towns along the Neper and vulgar rivers in modern day,

116
00:06:17.331 --> 00:06:21.110
Russia and Ukraine,
they created a more coordinated siting again,

117
00:06:21.111 --> 00:06:23.810
trade with foreign nations such as the Byzantine Empire,

118
00:06:23.811 --> 00:06:25.610
and founded the Reus cognate,

119
00:06:25.611 --> 00:06:28.220
which was a significant predecessor to modern Russia.

120
00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:32.660
The Vikings did more than just trade with the Byzantines and the year 988

121
00:06:32.661 --> 00:06:35.540
emperor basil.
The second form that the Va Randian card,

122
00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:39.410
a unit of the Byzantine army consisting very largely of Norseman.

123
00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:43.490
The emperor does trusting his own soldiers,
made them his personal guard,

124
00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:46.010
and this lasted as late as the 14th century,

125
00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:48.320
but even before the emperor set up this scar,

126
00:06:48.321 --> 00:06:52.310
there were varying Ian's fighting and the Byzantine Empire against the emirate

127
00:06:52.311 --> 00:06:54.560
of Crete and the Arab is in Syria,

128
00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:59.180
the Byzantine princess and a come Nana referred to them as ax wielding

129
00:06:59.181 --> 00:07:01.160
barbarians from the Thule for the Thule,

130
00:07:01.161 --> 00:07:03.740
very likely meaning the British isles in Scandinavia.

131
00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:07.880
It's kind of interesting to see the Norseman fighting and he's more exotic

132
00:07:07.881 --> 00:07:08.391
environments.

133
00:07:08.391 --> 00:07:11.540
We don't really remember the vikings as people who were involved in these

134
00:07:11.541 --> 00:07:13.760
eastern and Mediterranean complex,

135
00:07:13.761 --> 00:07:15.800
but it did definitely have a role to play here.

136
00:07:16.010 --> 00:07:19.550
The vikings were in Italy as well at first of course to raid,

137
00:07:19.551 --> 00:07:22.940
but then eventually the Italians began to enlist Bahrainian mercenaries and

138
00:07:22.941 --> 00:07:23.774
their armies.

139
00:07:24.170 --> 00:07:28.010
The first instance being in the early 10th century in combat against the Arabs,

140
00:07:28.011 --> 00:07:29.600
and later in the 11th century,

141
00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:32.720
north people actually conquered Sicily and southern Italy.

142
00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:34.460
So they can see from all of this.

143
00:07:34.461 --> 00:07:37.140
The vikings were a bit more than north of our bearings,

144
00:07:37.150 --> 00:07:41.060
who just made a habit of ruining people's days.
They,
throughout the Viking Age,

145
00:07:41.061 --> 00:07:43.760
had a major influence on all of Western civilization,

146
00:07:44.060 --> 00:07:48.170
but they also expanded beyond European civilization to where no Europeans had

147
00:07:48.171 --> 00:07:49.790
gone before.
And the next video,

148
00:07:49.791 --> 00:07:52.730
we'll talk about how the Viking and settled places like the Faroe Islands,

149
00:07:52.731 --> 00:07:53.900
Iceland,
Greenland,

150
00:07:53.901 --> 00:07:57.860
and even encountered native Americans while settling North America to keep up

151
00:07:57.861 --> 00:08:01.130
with the series.
