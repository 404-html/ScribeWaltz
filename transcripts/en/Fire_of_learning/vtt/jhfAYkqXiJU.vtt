00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.030
Hello and welcome to fire of learning.
In past videos,

2
00:00:03.031 --> 00:00:06.510
we've talked quite a bit about the Myers Briggs personality test and today we're

3
00:00:06.511 --> 00:00:09.510
going to talk about the big five personality tests,

4
00:00:09.511 --> 00:00:12.990
which actually psychologists have a tendency to prefer over the NBTI,

5
00:00:12.991 --> 00:00:14.640
which looks floor here in a bit.

6
00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.730
So the big five personality tests also known as the f f m five factor model.

7
00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:22.290
This has measures five personality traits on a scale,

8
00:00:22.291 --> 00:00:24.930
often abbreviated as ocean or canoe.

9
00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.940
These traits are openness to experience conscientiousness,
extroversion,

10
00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.980
agreeableness,
and neuroticism.

11
00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.560
So let's go through and look at what these scales indicate.

12
00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.330
Openness to experience.
The openness scale has to do with,
as you might expect,

13
00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.290
things like being receptive to new ideas,
being creative,
being curious,

14
00:00:43.291 --> 00:00:45.360
and handling variety and novelty.
Well,

15
00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.450
and individuals who score high on this trade obviously exhibit these

16
00:00:48.451 --> 00:00:49.380
aforementioned traits.

17
00:00:49.381 --> 00:00:52.980
They're generally very open minded and maybe even more intelligence being able

18
00:00:52.981 --> 00:00:57.180
to handle and actually actively seek out new concepts and experiences.

19
00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:58.013
Very often,

20
00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.910
lower scores tend to be more regimented and for lack of a more tact term,

21
00:01:02.911 --> 00:01:06.450
closed minded.
Lower scores have their conceptions,
their opinions,

22
00:01:06.451 --> 00:01:10.920
their modus operandi all in order and they're not quite as likely to divert from

23
00:01:10.921 --> 00:01:14.970
it.
They enjoy more consistency and don't see much point in novelty.

24
00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:16.740
Conscientiousness.

25
00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.880
The conscientiousness scale has to do with trade such as diligence,
persistence,

26
00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:24.120
organization,
work ethic,
thoroughness,
et Cetera,
et cetera.

27
00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.170
Higher scores tend to approach things more systematically than more often task

28
00:01:28.171 --> 00:01:28.860
oriented.

29
00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.580
They place greater emphasis on organization and are more focused on producing

30
00:01:32.581 --> 00:01:35.410
results in the external world.
Lower scores,
however,

31
00:01:35.411 --> 00:01:38.190
it may be a little bit less systematically efficient than may place.

32
00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.250
Less emphasis on things like organization,
punctuality,

33
00:01:41.251 --> 00:01:44.940
but are less likely than the high conscientious chorus to be conformist and are

34
00:01:44.941 --> 00:01:49.230
generally more laid back.
Very high scores may be considered workaholics.

35
00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:52.860
Very low scores may be impulsive and have trouble with organization

36
00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.310
extroversion,
extroversion and its opposite.

37
00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.210
Introversion is a fairly commonly understood concept of personality psychology

38
00:02:00.211 --> 00:02:03.900
already.
People who score high on extroversion tend to be stimulated by social

39
00:02:03.901 --> 00:02:06.870
interaction and external activity more than lower scores.

40
00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:10.410
That doesn't necessarily mean that an extrovert is a better people person in

41
00:02:10.411 --> 00:02:13.350
terms of social interaction.
That actually has to do more with art.

42
00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:16.950
Next trade here,
just that they are more stimulated by social interaction.

43
00:02:16.951 --> 00:02:21.510
If that makes sense.
Essentially higher scores prefer to act,
then reflect,

44
00:02:21.511 --> 00:02:25.290
then act again while lower scores.
Introverts prefer to reflect,
then act,

45
00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:26.400
then reflect again.

46
00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:30.060
Higher scores may have a wide group of friends while lower scores may prefer

47
00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:32.340
fewer,
more tightly knit.
Friend groups,

48
00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:36.870
agreeableness I read on this has to do with traits such as empathy,
tolerance,

49
00:02:36.871 --> 00:02:39.960
cooperation,
kindness,
trust,
things of that nature.

50
00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:42.120
Higher scores tend to be more altruistic.

51
00:02:42.121 --> 00:02:44.610
They have a genuine care for how others are feeling.

52
00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.380
They enjoy the presence of people they like.

53
00:02:46.381 --> 00:02:49.890
They may even take up positions of ensuring harmony within a friend group or

54
00:02:49.891 --> 00:02:53.880
family or whatever and are quite skilled and working to achieve it and we'll

55
00:02:53.881 --> 00:02:57.660
generally prefer to make decisions with reference to their own emotions and also

56
00:02:57.661 --> 00:03:01.120
with consideration to the and harmony of others around them.

57
00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:04.600
Lower scores are less empathetic,
they're less interested in emotions.

58
00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:08.320
They prefer to make a savings,
which they believe are based on logic,

59
00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:11.350
but what higher scores may see as callousness,

60
00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:15.580
very low scores may even be somewhat selfish or generally like empathy for other

61
00:03:15.581 --> 00:03:19.150
people.
And finally,
our last scale is neuroticism.

62
00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:23.560
The neuroticism scale has to do with essentially your level of mental stability.

63
00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:26.920
Higher scores tend to believe it or not be more neurotic.

64
00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:30.100
They tend to experience negative emotions such as fear,
anxiety,

65
00:03:30.101 --> 00:03:33.670
sadness and depression,
jealousy,
isolation,
anger and guilt.

66
00:03:33.671 --> 00:03:37.930
More often and accordingly have higher likelihoods of having or developing a

67
00:03:37.931 --> 00:03:40.540
mental disorder associated with these negative feelings.

68
00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:42.640
Lower scores tend to be more mentally stable.

69
00:03:42.641 --> 00:03:46.450
They tend to have more consistently positive emotions and are in more control of

70
00:03:46.451 --> 00:03:48.700
their emotional state and disposition.
Generally,

71
00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:50.200
they're more resilient to stressors,

72
00:03:50.201 --> 00:03:54.220
whereas higher scores may be overwhelmed at times by external stressors or even

73
00:03:54.221 --> 00:03:56.500
internal stressors.
So in essence,

74
00:03:56.501 --> 00:03:59.230
that's what the big five personality test is a balance,

75
00:03:59.231 --> 00:04:00.760
but it covers these five traits.

76
00:04:00.761 --> 00:04:04.240
Scales actually encompass a considerable portion of a person's psychology and

77
00:04:04.241 --> 00:04:06.640
are considerably reliable and consistent.

78
00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:09.430
What you might have noticed if you've seen my NBTI videos,

79
00:04:09.431 --> 00:04:13.090
is that most of these scales correlate with the Myers Briggs Dichotomy and union

80
00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:13.930
functions.

81
00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:17.140
I can go more into the exact correlation in the future if you guys would like,

82
00:04:17.141 --> 00:04:20.530
but the point of my mentioning this is that a lot of these personality tests

83
00:04:20.531 --> 00:04:22.480
tend to focus on very similar traits,

84
00:04:22.481 --> 00:04:25.570
which is a key lesson and personality psychology.

85
00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:28.060
