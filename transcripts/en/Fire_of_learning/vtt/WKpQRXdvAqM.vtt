00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:13.910
The Roman Empire.
Is there another empire?

2
00:00:13.911 --> 00:00:15.800
Quite like it in western history,

3
00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:20.240
the nations of the Western world look back on Rome as a kind of forefather.

4
00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:24.020
Many of the empires which followed wrong from Charlemagne to Mussolini,

5
00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:26.930
even the empire is or Britain,
France and Spain,

6
00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:29.750
which are much larger than Rome ever was in many ways,

7
00:00:29.751 --> 00:00:31.880
modeled themselves in Rome's image.

8
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000
The Word Kai's are Caesar even remains the word for emperor in many languages

9
00:00:37.551 --> 00:00:40.520
today with a similar connotation and English.

10
00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:43.370
And that is not the only word that the Romans gave us.

11
00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:48.410
Many European languages in general are in fact echoes of the Latin language,

12
00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:49.550
which the Roman spoke,

13
00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:54.610
including partially English and language is only one aspect of our daily lives

14
00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:59.140
that originated in ancient Rome.
What was wrong?

15
00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:02.510
Everyone has heard of at least some parts of Roman history,

16
00:01:02.511 --> 00:01:07.160
but how often is the whole story told from its origins as the humble,

17
00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:12.250
maybe despicable city state to its rise as a magnificent and unparalleled empire

18
00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:17.450
to its catastrophic collapse.
And this video,
we are going to tell that story.

19
00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:20.600
This is the full history of the Roman Empire.

20
00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:24.123
<v 1>MMM.</v>

21
00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:29.990
<v 0>Before we begin,
I would like to thank Jeff Carpenter,</v>

22
00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:34.580
Darra Shariat and Stefan [inaudible] for being our most recent supporters on

23
00:01:34.581 --> 00:01:38.300
patriotic.
They join the supporters who help make videos like this possible.

24
00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:42.140
And I would like to thank all of you for joining us in our first documentary or

25
00:01:42.141 --> 00:01:47.000
2019 as we now add Rome to the list of peoples and nations whose history we have

26
00:01:47.001 --> 00:01:47.834
fully covered.

27
00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:54.360
The story of the foundation of Rome is one of both a myth and fact,

28
00:01:54.361 --> 00:01:58.470
which historians still endeavor to separate many of the names and events crucial

29
00:01:58.471 --> 00:02:01.230
to Rome's early foundation,
maybe last forever,

30
00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:04.860
but the legend perhaps contains important elements of truth.
Well,

31
00:02:04.861 --> 00:02:08.820
Legend tells of two twin brothers,
Romulus and Remus,

32
00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:10.200
descendants of the Trojan,

33
00:02:10.201 --> 00:02:14.280
a niece and sons of the god Mars and the Princess Reyes Sylvia,

34
00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:17.080
who were ordered to be drowned by a jealous uncle.
Wait,

35
00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:18.870
seize power from their grandfather.

36
00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:22.950
It King of a city called all the longer the twins were secretly spared.
However,

37
00:02:22.951 --> 00:02:25.980
in set the drift and the Tiber river in a basket where they were later

38
00:02:25.981 --> 00:02:28.950
discovered by a she wolf who nurse to twins back to health.

39
00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:33.660
They were then discovered by shepherd who raised them into adulthood as adults,

40
00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:37.350
Romulus and Remus discover the true origins and would eventually kill their

41
00:02:37.351 --> 00:02:40.020
uncle and restore their grandfather to his throne,

42
00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:44.880
but we'll then go on to found their own city where this city was to be founded,

43
00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:48.960
however,
and who its king would be.
Quickly became a matter of debate.

44
00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:54.380
Romulus won that debate by killing remiss and as Legend states on April 21st

45
00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:57.510
seven 53 BC,

46
00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:02.630
he built his city on the hill and as its first king named it after himself,

47
00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:08.250
Roma Romulus eager to attract a new population and invited all of them he could

48
00:03:08.771 --> 00:03:09.730
to settle in Rome,

49
00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:13.810
but it quickly became a city filled with the dregs of society thieves,

50
00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:16.510
outcast criminals,
and runaway slaves.

51
00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:21.100
Romulus then formed a government which included 100 men from the city's leading

52
00:03:21.101 --> 00:03:23.890
families,
the poetry's or fathers,

53
00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:28.120
and thus established the Roman Senate.
Though the population was growing,

54
00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:32.200
it was overwhelmingly male.
Obviously a problem and the long term,

55
00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:36.670
but the inhabitants of Romer so undesirable that women from neighboring lands

56
00:03:36.671 --> 00:03:40.060
were entirely on interested in marrying them.
Accordingly,

57
00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:44.200
Romulus would organize a massive kidnapping of women from the neighboring towns

58
00:03:44.201 --> 00:03:45.034
and cities.

59
00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:48.700
This led to wars that could have potentially destroyed Rome had the women

60
00:03:48.701 --> 00:03:52.810
themselves.
It's not intervene to avoid becoming both widows and fatherless.

61
00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:56.950
It's a fascinating story,
but it's unclear what truth there is to it.

62
00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:00.430
Much of it is very obviously fable,
including even Romulus,

63
00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:04.180
but the Romans somewhat knew that the events and characters of the story,

64
00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:05.350
however,
as I said,

65
00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:10.030
maybe representations of the real work of the early Roman peoples and their

66
00:04:10.031 --> 00:04:12.670
interactions with the metallic peoples around them.

67
00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:16.840
It's also a surprising story and that'd be Romans who would later thinks so

68
00:04:16.841 --> 00:04:20.890
highly of themselves would claim to be descended from reprobates who his actions

69
00:04:20.891 --> 00:04:22.480
where a criminal and shameful.

70
00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:27.250
What we do know factually is that the area around Rome was inhabited for

71
00:04:27.251 --> 00:04:28.450
thousands of years.

72
00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:33.510
The earliest discovered habitations maybe from as far back as 1000 BC in the

73
00:04:33.941 --> 00:04:37.210
eighth century BC,
Rome was a smaller city state.

74
00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:39.610
Frankly more like an unimpressive town.

75
00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:44.050
The Romans were surrounded by other Latin peoples and more broadly other

76
00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:47.320
Retallick peoples such as the Etruscans,
Sabine's,

77
00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:52.030
umbrians and Sam nights with Greek colonies having been established in the
south,

78
00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:56.890
the Greeks a more powerful and advanced civilization at the time were very

79
00:04:56.891 --> 00:05:00.850
influential to Italy's early development.
Things like their religion,

80
00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:03.160
their system of writing,
their trade,

81
00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:07.450
technology and culture would be adopted by the people as of ancient Italy and

82
00:05:07.451 --> 00:05:11.680
slowly become Roman,
but true regional power at that time.
However,

83
00:05:11.681 --> 00:05:15.370
it was not the Romans,
it was the Etruscans people mysterious to us.

84
00:05:15.371 --> 00:05:17.500
Still though not a single nation,

85
00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:20.650
they were a common people who at times worked collectively.

86
00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:23.830
It is likely that the Romans did not simply mimic the Greeks,

87
00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:27.430
but they mimic the Etruscans who had partially mimic degrees.

88
00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:31.330
The very location of Rome for the more and the center of Italy along the Tiber

89
00:05:31.331 --> 00:05:35.440
river was likely chosen apart from its natural defensiveness because it would

90
00:05:35.441 --> 00:05:38.290
benefit from the trade between the Greeks and the Etruscans.

91
00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:42.430
From the eighth fifth,
sixth centuries.
BC,
Rome remained a small city,

92
00:05:42.431 --> 00:05:47.110
state and habited by simple people ruled over by what Roman historians say,

93
00:05:47.111 --> 00:05:51.550
where a series of seven kings keep in mind this period too,
however,

94
00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:56.590
is very unclear and probably partially fictitious as is much of the history

95
00:05:56.591 --> 00:05:59.960
until three 90 BC.
But we'll get to that in a moment.

96
00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:04.040
Rome was indeed likely Kanombe in the eighth to sixth centuries BC.

97
00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:09.110
The last king was the tyrannical King Taran who has said to a rural from fire 35

98
00:06:09.111 --> 00:06:13.730
to five oh nine BC and one incident his son is said to have raped and important

99
00:06:13.731 --> 00:06:16.610
noble woman named Leucadia.
In response,

100
00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:20.360
the incident sparked rebellion under Luke ewas units.
Brutus,

101
00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:24.080
Brutus and his comrades succeeded and vanishing the royal family,

102
00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:28.580
but instead of appointing a new king vow to never have another and formed the

103
00:06:28.581 --> 00:06:32.510
Roman republic and five Oh nine BC who was the real Rome,

104
00:06:32.511 --> 00:06:37.511
now say not [inaudible] loose Romanos the Roman Senate and people abbreviated s

105
00:06:39.381 --> 00:06:41.360
p Q.
R.

106
00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:45.710
Much of the Republican design such as the Senate was already in place from the

107
00:06:45.711 --> 00:06:47.810
beginning,
even under the kings.
For.

108
00:06:47.811 --> 00:06:51.980
This was still a major step at the head of the government were to elected

109
00:06:51.981 --> 00:06:56.180
councils who would serve a term of just one year.
The Senate consisted of,

110
00:06:56.240 --> 00:07:01.070
as was previously mentioned,
men of the aristocracy at least 30 years old.

111
00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:05.990
Younger politicians were seen as too brazen and in fact the word senator comes

112
00:07:05.991 --> 00:07:09.110
from the Latin Senex,
meaning old.
Uh,

113
00:07:09.111 --> 00:07:13.850
senate is therefore according to the Romans Anyway,
and assembly of elders.

114
00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:19.010
Not everyone born in Rome was a citizen and of those citizens,
only a minority.

115
00:07:19.011 --> 00:07:23.000
We're patricians the highest class,
the majority of Roman citizens.

116
00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:27.320
We're born into the class known as play peons who held little power in the city

117
00:07:27.321 --> 00:07:30.560
at this time.
The majority of the population,
however,

118
00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:34.640
consisted of non land owning men and women,
slaves and a stork,

119
00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:37.340
non citizens upon its foundation.

120
00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:41.390
The Roman republic would resume it's conflict with its neighbors and very slow

121
00:07:41.391 --> 00:07:43.700
absorption of the lands in central Italy.

122
00:07:44.090 --> 00:07:46.820
This is not the glorious Rome with which we are familiar.

123
00:07:46.910 --> 00:07:50.150
Rome was still just a city on the edge of the known world,

124
00:07:50.210 --> 00:07:52.850
ruling over about 10 square miles of land.

125
00:07:53.090 --> 00:07:56.960
Rome would remain a city state for the next century and a half.
In this time,

126
00:07:56.961 --> 00:08:00.320
there would be important social developments as the play begins,

127
00:08:00.321 --> 00:08:03.740
fought for him greater influence and the government of Rome and struggles which

128
00:08:03.741 --> 00:08:08.000
would last for over 200 years known as the conflict of the orders.

129
00:08:08.300 --> 00:08:09.590
During this conflict,

130
00:08:09.710 --> 00:08:13.760
a number of play being consular tribunes were established and roan came up with

131
00:08:13.761 --> 00:08:17.480
the idea of appointing a dictator in times of troubles.

132
00:08:17.660 --> 00:08:21.560
The word dictator did not have the negative meaning it does today.

133
00:08:21.620 --> 00:08:25.460
Dictators were to take on the full authority of Romans government during times

134
00:08:25.461 --> 00:08:28.730
of crisis but resign after around six months.

135
00:08:28.820 --> 00:08:30.680
By the fourth century BC,

136
00:08:30.710 --> 00:08:35.210
the Celtic peoples of northern Italy and France known as he calls began moving

137
00:08:35.211 --> 00:08:38.600
south.
It is recorded that in 400 BC,

138
00:08:38.660 --> 00:08:42.950
a group of Golish Celts called these unknown A's under King Brenna's cross the

139
00:08:42.951 --> 00:08:47.750
Alps and again attacking the northern Italians.
Eventually they reached Rome.

140
00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:49.580
The Romans mounted at offense,

141
00:08:49.670 --> 00:08:53.630
but at the battle of alia the Romans were crushed and the goals then moved into

142
00:08:53.631 --> 00:08:57.690
Rome itself and sack the city.
This is the Afa mentioned incident,

143
00:08:57.720 --> 00:09:02.580
which destroyed many of the prior historical records.
The Gauls would not stay,

144
00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:05.040
however sagging the city was sufficient for them.

145
00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:08.760
Legends say they were later fought off by a general named Marcus.

146
00:09:08.761 --> 00:09:13.050
Foodie was Camillus who boldly told them that the Romans defended their city

147
00:09:13.051 --> 00:09:15.180
with iron,
not gold.
However,

148
00:09:15.181 --> 00:09:19.110
many historians today do believe that the goals were bribed with goal to leave.

149
00:09:19.530 --> 00:09:20.220
Either way,

150
00:09:20.220 --> 00:09:24.480
this event reshaped the Roman mindset and the recovery period is sometimes

151
00:09:24.481 --> 00:09:27.180
referred to as the second founding of Rome.

152
00:09:27.390 --> 00:09:31.750
The Romans developed a fear of the barbarians of unknown lands and rediscover

153
00:09:31.751 --> 00:09:34.860
the importance of the defense of the Fatherland Rome.

154
00:09:34.861 --> 00:09:37.280
Soon return to becoming the foremost city and he,

155
00:09:37.281 --> 00:09:42.281
Talia and its neighbors started to notice from 348 PC to two 90 BC,

156
00:09:42.830 --> 00:09:45.060
a series of conflicts were fought in Italy,

157
00:09:45.090 --> 00:09:48.690
most notably the three satellite wars against the Romans neighbors,

158
00:09:48.870 --> 00:09:53.820
the Sameon after whom the Sam night wars are named were among Rome's earliest

159
00:09:53.821 --> 00:09:57.720
great rivals.
The two would fight for dominance over all of central Italy.

160
00:09:57.780 --> 00:10:00.930
The Sam neons would be able to count on many other allies,

161
00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:04.410
including the [inaudible],
a trust skins,
other Italian peoples,

162
00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:08.400
and even the goals.
Yet by two 95 BC,

163
00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:12.330
the conflict started to wind down with the battle of sending them in which the

164
00:10:12.331 --> 00:10:17.160
Romans defeated a combined to Gatwick and Sam the enforce the odds were against

165
00:10:17.161 --> 00:10:20.040
the Romans from the beginning,
but their successes here,

166
00:10:20.041 --> 00:10:24.240
it could be owed to their unwavering persistence and spirit following Rome's

167
00:10:24.241 --> 00:10:24.900
victory.

168
00:10:24.900 --> 00:10:28.920
They would control the majority of the peninsula and we begin to see that these

169
00:10:28.921 --> 00:10:33.240
are indeed a people who have the potential to build a mighty empire.

170
00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:38.100
Rome was not really operating like a real empire at this point for much of the

171
00:10:38.101 --> 00:10:42.930
history of the republic and Intuit's later years as an empire conquered

172
00:10:42.931 --> 00:10:47.010
territories,
we're not always fully annexed,
at least not right away.

173
00:10:47.130 --> 00:10:49.320
Often they were turned into clients,

174
00:10:49.321 --> 00:10:53.820
states retaining some autonomy while owing some tribute or service to Rome.

175
00:10:53.940 --> 00:10:58.710
What each state owed varied from situation to situation.
But in these early days,

176
00:10:58.770 --> 00:11:02.580
Rome usually simply sought military support in times of war.

177
00:11:02.790 --> 00:11:04.710
Rome was now a true power,

178
00:11:05.010 --> 00:11:09.630
but great power often attracts powerful rivals to the south,
stood Magnar,

179
00:11:09.631 --> 00:11:14.400
good Ikea,
the Greek colonies in Italy and on the surrounding islands of Sicily,

180
00:11:14.430 --> 00:11:16.140
Sardinia and Corsica,

181
00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:20.340
where the Carthaginians nation people who built a wealthy and powerful

182
00:11:20.341 --> 00:11:25.290
Mediterranean empire from their capitol of the same name and Modern Day Tunisia,

183
00:11:25.470 --> 00:11:29.700
Rome and the Greeks would be the first to combat each other.
The Greek colonies.

184
00:11:29.701 --> 00:11:30.391
At this time,

185
00:11:30.391 --> 00:11:35.100
we're disunited and Greece itself was not a unified nation at this time either.

186
00:11:35.190 --> 00:11:39.030
The Romans would exploit this division,
a tactic they would use frequently.

187
00:11:39.060 --> 00:11:43.590
As time went on leading to conflict with multiple Greek Italian cities,
Rome.

188
00:11:43.590 --> 00:11:47.640
Now a military machine could have easily rolled over the Greek city states.

189
00:11:47.730 --> 00:11:51.510
However,
the colony is called upon allies from Greece itself.

190
00:11:51.540 --> 00:11:55.420
Coming to the rescue was an ambitious king purists of a Pirus,

191
00:11:55.540 --> 00:12:00.400
a second cousin of Alexander the Great.
He arrived in two 82 BC.

192
00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:03.280
Beginning one is remembered as the period wars.

193
00:12:03.700 --> 00:12:06.790
This was a monumentous classical showdown.

194
00:12:06.820 --> 00:12:10.390
The Macedonian Phalynx would soon face.
The Roman Legion.

195
00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:14.620
Purists would engage the Romans in two major battles Hara Clia and asked for

196
00:12:14.621 --> 00:12:19.360
them.
His soldiers and command proved superior as he won both times with no small

197
00:12:19.361 --> 00:12:23.710
thanks to his war elephants,
which sent the Roman men and horses,

198
00:12:23.770 --> 00:12:27.400
many of whom had never seen anything like an elephant fleeing and panic.

199
00:12:27.430 --> 00:12:30.370
But these victories had come at great costs,

200
00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:33.310
purists last crucial chunks of his army.
In both battles,

201
00:12:33.370 --> 00:12:37.840
he planned to rely on recruiting new men from the countryside and defeated army.

202
00:12:37.870 --> 00:12:42.340
But he found few volunteers.
The loyalty of the Romans had surprised him.

203
00:12:42.430 --> 00:12:46.180
This was a problem.
He knew that whatever losses the Romans took,

204
00:12:46.210 --> 00:12:50.350
they would be able to replenish their troops faster and easier.
And thus,

205
00:12:50.351 --> 00:12:53.560
this is the origin of the phrase,
a pyrrhic victory,

206
00:12:53.590 --> 00:12:57.700
referring to a victory which has cost so much that it is effectively at a feat.

207
00:12:57.910 --> 00:13:02.410
Such was the case with purists who had beaten the Romans but lost his army in

208
00:13:02.411 --> 00:13:06.820
the process.
And in two 75 BC at the battle of Bennett vent them,

209
00:13:06.910 --> 00:13:09.400
the Romans would attack the Greeks.
And finally the feet,

210
00:13:09.460 --> 00:13:13.300
the withering forces purists returned to Greece and the Romans Annex,

211
00:13:13.301 --> 00:13:16.480
the Greek colonies.
Rome had beaten the Greeks,

212
00:13:16.840 --> 00:13:20.470
but they would not stop here then with soon,
seek out new conquest,

213
00:13:20.530 --> 00:13:25.530
transforming from a humble republic into an imperial republic and empire,

214
00:13:25.541 --> 00:13:30.070
which the Western world had never before seen.
However,
for the time being,

215
00:13:30.100 --> 00:13:33.460
standing in their way was the mighty empire of Carthage.

216
00:13:33.580 --> 00:13:37.210
Soon Roman Carthage would clash in a series of wars,

217
00:13:37.300 --> 00:13:42.220
which would last for over a century and haunt Rome for the rest of its
existence.

218
00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:49.860
The Romans referred to the Carthaginians as Phoenicians or poo,
Niki.

219
00:13:49.990 --> 00:13:53.040
They were at this time like their phone,
each and ancestors,

220
00:13:53.070 --> 00:13:55.270
the dominant Mediterranean traits people,

221
00:13:55.360 --> 00:13:59.740
but Rome feeling quite confident after a string of victories had it's eyes on

222
00:13:59.741 --> 00:14:01.990
some prominent Carthaginian Holdings.

223
00:14:02.170 --> 00:14:07.170
Both empires had their eyes on Sicily and disputes here would lead to the first

224
00:14:07.451 --> 00:14:10.270
Punic war in two 64 BC.

225
00:14:10.330 --> 00:14:12.670
This would last for 23 years.

226
00:14:12.730 --> 00:14:17.140
It was fought on both land and sea and it wouldn't become one of the largest

227
00:14:17.141 --> 00:14:20.680
conflicts ever fought up to that point on the face of the earth.

228
00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:24.130
Rome sign number of successes here against Carthage on land,

229
00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:27.490
but learned early on that it was behind Carthage at sea.

230
00:14:27.520 --> 00:14:32.050
And thus it is in this conflict.
That emphasis is first placed on Rome's navy.

231
00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:34.270
An important step on the road to empire.

232
00:14:34.570 --> 00:14:37.750
The Roman simply lacked the Carthaginian naval technology,

233
00:14:37.900 --> 00:14:42.580
the Queen Queer Kareem's massive ships with five rows of Oris destroyed Roman

234
00:14:42.581 --> 00:14:43.720
vessels repeatedly.

235
00:14:44.080 --> 00:14:49.000
Historians believe that eventually the Romans happened upon a destroyed Quinn

236
00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:52.250
Queer Kareem and learn to reverse engineer it to create a navy which could

237
00:14:52.251 --> 00:14:55.280
finally challenge Carthage in two 47 BC,

238
00:14:55.310 --> 00:14:59.860
the famous Carthaginian General Hem Ecar Barca enter Sicily and use guerrilla

239
00:14:59.870 --> 00:15:03.260
warfare and clever tactics to hold the Romans off for years.

240
00:15:03.290 --> 00:15:07.160
But finally at the naval battle of a God,
he's in two 41 BC,

241
00:15:07.190 --> 00:15:11.210
the Romans scored victory and the first Punic war came to a close.

242
00:15:11.300 --> 00:15:15.740
Carthage suffered a heavy to feet and faced with financial difficulties soon

243
00:15:15.741 --> 00:15:19.370
fell into civil war.
Wrong took advantage of the situation.

244
00:15:19.371 --> 00:15:24.371
And NXE islands of Sardinia and Corsica Carthage crippled by instability could

245
00:15:24.951 --> 00:15:28.370
not prevent this and allowed it,
but they would not forget it.

246
00:15:28.700 --> 00:15:33.260
Eventually the rebellion was ended and Carthage under hemoccult Barca move to

247
00:15:33.261 --> 00:15:37.100
claim new territories and Iberia before he left.
However,

248
00:15:37.130 --> 00:15:41.720
he made his nine year old son swear that he would harbor eternal hatred for Rome

249
00:15:41.721 --> 00:15:46.100
and it's people that young boy would grow up to be one of history's greatest

250
00:15:46.101 --> 00:15:49.640
generals and thus one of Rome's greatest adversaries.

251
00:15:49.760 --> 00:15:52.730
His name was Hannibal of Carthage in Rome,

252
00:15:52.731 --> 00:15:56.180
remained a piece for some time each focused on other affairs.

253
00:15:56.360 --> 00:16:01.010
Rome focused on the northern Golic Lens and Carthage was recuperating and

254
00:16:01.011 --> 00:16:05.690
rebuilding US army.
By two 20 BC,
Hannibal have become a commander himself,

255
00:16:05.780 --> 00:16:10.100
still retaining his sworn hatred for the Roman people and planning revenge.

256
00:16:10.190 --> 00:16:14.570
He had developed plans to a knock that revenge slowly but effectively and got to

257
00:16:14.571 --> 00:16:18.310
work in two 19 BC.
His first move was to be seized.

258
00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:20.030
The city state of Sagoon tomb,

259
00:16:20.270 --> 00:16:25.190
a strategically important Greek city state in Iberia,
allied to Rome to Rome.

260
00:16:25.220 --> 00:16:29.840
The Carthaginian assault was a casus belli not long after war broke out,

261
00:16:29.870 --> 00:16:33.830
which would be much more draining and devastating to Rome than the first Punic

262
00:16:33.831 --> 00:16:36.620
war.
This would be the second Punic war.

263
00:16:36.770 --> 00:16:41.390
This is one of the most important wars of Roman history and frankly one of the

264
00:16:41.391 --> 00:16:44.540
largest and most important wars in ancient history.

265
00:16:44.570 --> 00:16:49.070
Hannibal had already shown signs of becoming a talented and effective commander

266
00:16:49.100 --> 00:16:53.240
and was greatly dedicated to realizing his ambitions.
For now though,

267
00:16:53.270 --> 00:16:56.960
the question remained how exactly was he to reach Rome?

268
00:16:57.140 --> 00:17:01.340
The Romans had control over the islands of the Mediterranean and had you served.

269
00:17:01.341 --> 00:17:04.910
Kartha does role as the major naval power,
the Romans,

270
00:17:04.940 --> 00:17:07.430
confident in how they expect that animal to act,

271
00:17:07.550 --> 00:17:12.380
what sends some forces to Sicily and would send other forces to Iberia under a

272
00:17:12.381 --> 00:17:17.330
general named [inaudible] who was Cornelia was Skipio the elder daringly

273
00:17:17.540 --> 00:17:21.620
Hannibal would not resort to using a navy to reach Rome.
Instead,

274
00:17:21.650 --> 00:17:25.790
he would move around through modern day France to attack Italy from the north.

275
00:17:25.850 --> 00:17:29.270
By crossing the alps,
it was a treacherous journey.

276
00:17:29.300 --> 00:17:33.830
Many men and animals perished on the march.
Some lost their footing and fell.

277
00:17:33.890 --> 00:17:35.780
Others died from the harsh cold.

278
00:17:35.840 --> 00:17:39.080
This was especially the case for the war elephants.

279
00:17:39.260 --> 00:17:41.930
Others died in combat with some of the local Celts.

280
00:17:41.970 --> 00:17:46.160
In total sources claim Hannibal would lose over half of his army,

281
00:17:46.520 --> 00:17:51.520
but he successfully arrived in northern at the end of October and two 18 BC

282
00:17:52.140 --> 00:17:54.660
catching the Romans completely off guard.

283
00:17:54.690 --> 00:17:59.180
Hannibal replenishes forces with local Gullix at port and a number of battles

284
00:17:59.181 --> 00:18:02.610
soon and sued each of them going very poorly.
For the Romans,

285
00:18:02.730 --> 00:18:06.660
at the battle of Trivia and at the battle of Lake Tresor mean the Romans will

286
00:18:06.661 --> 00:18:08.220
lose 30,000 men.

287
00:18:08.670 --> 00:18:12.030
Both times the Roman people have become grill concerned.

288
00:18:12.300 --> 00:18:15.450
They were clearly dealing with the commander of considerable skill.

289
00:18:15.480 --> 00:18:18.940
Thus they appointed a dictator Quintess Fabius maximus.

290
00:18:19.060 --> 00:18:24.060
What ecosys known as Fabius Fabius wanted to take on a new strategy against

291
00:18:24.151 --> 00:18:28.830
animal,
sometimes referred to as quick topwater that a layer because of it,

292
00:18:28.920 --> 00:18:31.440
he would not pursue direct glorious battle.

293
00:18:31.470 --> 00:18:34.890
He knew all too well how capable Hannibal was of handling that.

294
00:18:34.950 --> 00:18:39.120
He also knew Hannibal supplies in the region were limited and his gallic allies

295
00:18:39.121 --> 00:18:43.500
we're not interested in.
I drawn out war.
Therefore,
he began a war of attrition,

296
00:18:43.590 --> 00:18:47.730
avoiding direct battles in scorching his own country's food supplies in an

297
00:18:47.731 --> 00:18:52.440
effort to where his enemy out.
A tactic now known as the Fabian Strategy.

298
00:18:52.590 --> 00:18:55.950
Not all of his commanders would see eye to eye with them on the strategy,

299
00:18:55.951 --> 00:18:58.770
though the Romans were I proud and brave people.

300
00:18:58.920 --> 00:19:02.070
They viewed this tactic as cowardly and dishonorable.

301
00:19:02.220 --> 00:19:07.220
Eventually Fabius resigned from the office of dictator and new consoles who

302
00:19:07.231 --> 00:19:09.030
would change.
The tactics were elected.

303
00:19:09.180 --> 00:19:13.140
These more aggressive console's put together the largest Roman army ever

304
00:19:13.141 --> 00:19:16.920
assembled.
Up to that point,
at over 85,000 men,

305
00:19:17.160 --> 00:19:22.160
this massive force met the Carthaginian army of around 50,000 men near the city

306
00:19:22.501 --> 00:19:26.570
of Kanye.
On the 2nd of August two 16 BC can,

307
00:19:26.571 --> 00:19:31.440
I should have been the deciding Roman victory.
It did not turn out that way.

308
00:19:31.830 --> 00:19:34.560
The Romans recklessly attack the Carthaginians.

309
00:19:34.590 --> 00:19:39.590
Hannibal quite simply annihilated this force after cleverly managing to surround

310
00:19:39.871 --> 00:19:43.260
them at least 50,000 men,
but quite possibly even more,

311
00:19:43.290 --> 00:19:47.100
were destroyed by the Carthaginians who lost only around 6,000 men.

312
00:19:47.330 --> 00:19:49.230
Panic spread across the country.

313
00:19:49.380 --> 00:19:53.070
Not even the mightiest Roman army ever assembled could be Hannibal.

314
00:19:53.130 --> 00:19:57.030
To make matters worse,
King Philip of Mastodon began to support Carthage.

315
00:19:57.031 --> 00:20:00.060
At this point,
only a few battles in Roman history.

316
00:20:00.120 --> 00:20:02.470
Could compare to what happened at Kenai.

317
00:20:02.570 --> 00:20:07.570
The Romans nevertheless scrambled to rebuild their army and quite wisely decided

318
00:20:07.681 --> 00:20:09.960
to reemploy the Fabian strategy.

319
00:20:10.170 --> 00:20:14.910
All the while the war on other fronts when favorably for Rome and Iberia

320
00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:18.270
commanded fallen to the son of skippy or the elder Skipio,

321
00:20:18.271 --> 00:20:23.271
the younger later known as Skipio Africanus skippy or the younger had volunteer

322
00:20:24.061 --> 00:20:27.600
to become commander after the death of his father and uncle,

323
00:20:27.810 --> 00:20:30.750
he would soon prove to be the right man for the job.

324
00:20:30.930 --> 00:20:34.800
He would take the importance city of New Carthage,
the regional capital,

325
00:20:34.830 --> 00:20:38.490
and what drive the Carthaginian south back into Africa itself.

326
00:20:38.700 --> 00:20:42.300
Hannibal was a military genius,
has government,
however,

327
00:20:42.360 --> 00:20:43.860
did not share this genius.

328
00:20:44.070 --> 00:20:48.250
The Carthaginian government failed to reinforce Hannibal's army can die and then

329
00:20:48.251 --> 00:20:52.570
failed to respond when Rome turn the conflict around in the years afterward,

330
00:20:52.630 --> 00:20:57.100
sending troops to reinforce other areas instead.
By Two oh seven BC,

331
00:20:57.190 --> 00:21:02.110
Rome had retaken it's loss territories and invaded Carthaginian land at the

332
00:21:02.111 --> 00:21:04.060
battle of La Skipio.

333
00:21:04.061 --> 00:21:09.061
Afrikanas would deal a crushing blow to them effectively reverse of Kanai into o

334
00:21:09.160 --> 00:21:12.460
two BC at the battle of Zama near Carthage itself.

335
00:21:12.610 --> 00:21:15.940
Hannibal was defeated by Skipio us,

336
00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:18.190
one of the few men who could challenge him,

337
00:21:18.310 --> 00:21:21.400
and Carthage finally surrendered in two o one BC.

338
00:21:21.550 --> 00:21:25.750
This defeat was a crushing blow to Carthage.
It was not destroyed,

339
00:21:25.810 --> 00:21:30.430
but lost the vast share of its territory and became a Roman client.
State.
Rome,

340
00:21:30.610 --> 00:21:35.170
despite all at lost,
came out of this war with clear profound gains.

341
00:21:35.260 --> 00:21:40.260
It was now in control of the east of Iberia and was becoming a true empire,

342
00:21:40.660 --> 00:21:45.160
one which now that its greatest rival had been knocked out was a master of the

343
00:21:45.161 --> 00:21:46.060
Mediterranean.

344
00:21:46.150 --> 00:21:50.230
Hannibal would eventually be forced out of his own country and sent into exile

345
00:21:50.260 --> 00:21:54.100
where he would fight the Romans on the side of other armies until he committed

346
00:21:54.101 --> 00:21:57.370
suicide and one 80 to OBC to avoid capture.

347
00:21:57.490 --> 00:22:01.930
One might expect at this point for Rome to rest on the laurels of its victory.

348
00:22:02.080 --> 00:22:06.880
The second Punic war was greatly strenuous and Rome now have the opportunity to

349
00:22:06.881 --> 00:22:10.360
exploit its successes,
but to the east Macedonia.

350
00:22:10.450 --> 00:22:14.300
Under Philip the fifth west supported Hannibal remained a threat to their new

351
00:22:14.301 --> 00:22:15.490
found dominance.

352
00:22:15.640 --> 00:22:19.720
Rome would attempt to stamp out this threat by exploiting the division among the

353
00:22:19.721 --> 00:22:23.350
Greeks,
allying itself with Pergamon and roads.

354
00:22:23.410 --> 00:22:25.810
Greek city states who are under attack by Philip.

355
00:22:25.900 --> 00:22:30.900
This would lead to war with Mastodon in 200 BC only a year following the second

356
00:22:31.150 --> 00:22:31.960
Punic war,

357
00:22:31.960 --> 00:22:36.340
Rome entered into the region declaring that it was doing so on behalf of the

358
00:22:36.341 --> 00:22:39.910
freedom of the Greeks.
The ulterior motive,
however,

359
00:22:39.940 --> 00:22:42.790
was curving Macedonian expansion and power.

360
00:22:42.820 --> 00:22:47.320
The war would last for three years and ended in a Roman victory following the

361
00:22:47.321 --> 00:22:51.880
battle of scene assembly,
but the larger Greco Roman struggle was only beginning.

362
00:22:52.210 --> 00:22:55.960
This struggle would be another major event in world history.
As a whole.

363
00:22:56.680 --> 00:23:00.790
The light of Greece was fading and that of Rome was burning brighter.

364
00:23:01.210 --> 00:23:04.840
With Phillips Defeat,
Rome declared Greece was free,

365
00:23:04.900 --> 00:23:09.490
but in practice still retained forces in the region.
Seeing what was happening.

366
00:23:09.520 --> 00:23:13.570
Some of the Greeks does look to yet another foreign power to liberate them from

367
00:23:13.571 --> 00:23:17.920
foreign rule.
This time,
the solution empire of Anatolia and empire,

368
00:23:17.921 --> 00:23:22.600
which was a Greek successor state to Alexander the Empire Division emerged among

369
00:23:22.601 --> 00:23:25.000
the Greek cities.
Some favored Rome,

370
00:23:25.090 --> 00:23:28.840
others the solutions tension with soon break into conflict,

371
00:23:28.870 --> 00:23:32.980
Sparta had been the most resilient to Roman influence and met the Romans at the

372
00:23:32.981 --> 00:23:37.100
battle of Gilliam and one 95 BC,
Rome and its allies.

373
00:23:37.120 --> 00:23:40.060
It would be victorious here and one 92 BC.

374
00:23:40.120 --> 00:23:44.230
The I told Ian League invited the solutions under Antioch is the third into the

375
00:23:44.231 --> 00:23:49.231
region as liberator's Rome was joined by the Archean League and other allies and

376
00:23:49.371 --> 00:23:53.150
thus began the syllabus said war.
Within the first phases of the war,

377
00:23:53.151 --> 00:23:56.900
the Romans scored an impressive victory at the infamous ancient battle ground of

378
00:23:56.901 --> 00:24:01.580
Thermopylae at the battle of Magnesia and one 90 BC.
The solution space,

379
00:24:01.581 --> 00:24:05.600
another crush and defeat and the war easily ended and Roman victory.

380
00:24:05.810 --> 00:24:07.520
With the conclusion of this war,

381
00:24:07.700 --> 00:24:10.430
Rome was beginning to catch a glimpse of its future.

382
00:24:10.520 --> 00:24:14.720
It had beaten as regional competitors and was indirectly in control of their

383
00:24:14.721 --> 00:24:15.470
lands.

384
00:24:15.470 --> 00:24:20.460
Mastodon would make another attempt to resist the Roman one 79 BC under Philip

385
00:24:20.461 --> 00:24:24.260
successor per se,
us and what is called the third Macedonian war.

386
00:24:24.400 --> 00:24:26.990
Perseus was joined by many of the Greek cities,

387
00:24:26.991 --> 00:24:31.590
which had opposed Rome in the past and for a time it seemed as though massive

388
00:24:31.600 --> 00:24:33.830
don was going to truly defeat Rome,

389
00:24:34.100 --> 00:24:38.090
but at the battle of [inaudible] and one 60 ABC per se,

390
00:24:38.091 --> 00:24:40.490
as his ambitions fell apart here,

391
00:24:40.610 --> 00:24:44.810
his phalynx encountered it's historical arch enemy on even terrain,

392
00:24:44.960 --> 00:24:47.750
and the more flexible Roman legions tore them apart,

393
00:24:47.780 --> 00:24:52.780
killing perhaps around 25,000 of them while losing less than 1000 with

394
00:24:53.541 --> 00:24:57.560
opposition falling apart,
Currys was now completely subject to Rome,

395
00:24:57.800 --> 00:24:59.720
though piece followed this conflict.

396
00:24:59.750 --> 00:25:03.920
Many Romans were still anxious of the threat of potential rivals across the

397
00:25:03.921 --> 00:25:07.100
horizon.
One such anxious Roman was Cato,

398
00:25:07.101 --> 00:25:10.040
the elder who finished every speech he made in the Senate,

399
00:25:10.190 --> 00:25:14.660
regardless of what it was about with a short phrase,
k,
Ted ohm can say,
oh,

400
00:25:14.661 --> 00:25:17.420
Carnegie numb essay,
the London.
And furthermore,

401
00:25:17.600 --> 00:25:19.640
I believe Carthage must be destroyed.

402
00:25:20.120 --> 00:25:22.580
Carthage was certainly not what it used to be.

403
00:25:22.640 --> 00:25:26.810
It's military prowess had diminished with the loss of Hannibal and the Romans

404
00:25:26.811 --> 00:25:29.090
would soon take advantage of their situation.

405
00:25:29.210 --> 00:25:34.210
Both the fourth Macedonian war and the third Punic war began in one 50 and one

406
00:25:35.421 --> 00:25:38.600
49 BC respectively.
Both engagements,

407
00:25:38.630 --> 00:25:40.460
we're smaller than their predecessors.

408
00:25:40.520 --> 00:25:45.520
The fourth Macedonian war was a Greek uprising that ended in failure and one 48

409
00:25:45.741 --> 00:25:50.741
BC and the third Punic war was focused mostly around the three year long siege

410
00:25:51.020 --> 00:25:55.790
of the city of Carthage,
Carthage,
his last stand and one 46 BC,

411
00:25:55.791 --> 00:26:00.620
the adopted grandson of Skipio Afrikanas Skipio I Emilio [inaudible] took the

412
00:26:00.621 --> 00:26:04.370
city of Carthage piece by piece.
Once the walls were breached,

413
00:26:04.400 --> 00:26:07.580
the Carthaginians fought for every block wants taken.

414
00:26:07.610 --> 00:26:12.610
The population of around 400,000 was either massacred or enslaved and the entire

415
00:26:13.431 --> 00:26:17.120
city was burned to the ground.
Despite common legend,

416
00:26:17.160 --> 00:26:20.990
the Romans likely did not actually salt the earth around Carthage.

417
00:26:21.020 --> 00:26:23.990
Part of the motivation for invasion was after all,

418
00:26:23.991 --> 00:26:26.420
Carthage is agricultural abundance.

419
00:26:27.230 --> 00:26:32.230
Rome was now the undisputed master of the Mediterranean and it is following the

420
00:26:32.631 --> 00:26:37.631
year one 46 BC that the Roman Empire with which we are familiar becomes

421
00:26:38.300 --> 00:26:41.300
recognizable following that a feat of its enemies.

422
00:26:41.390 --> 00:26:46.200
The tremendous energy of this new would turn inward as the focus came to be on

423
00:26:46.201 --> 00:26:48.660
the competition between rival politicians.

424
00:26:48.900 --> 00:26:52.530
Two of the most famous figures of this era are the [inaudible] brothers.

425
00:26:52.620 --> 00:26:55.860
Key Batty was Tiberius and Gaius Krokus.

426
00:26:56.010 --> 00:27:00.210
Both of them were populist in nature and work to better the Roman number
classes.

427
00:27:00.430 --> 00:27:04.920
The most famous of their attempted reforms was the redistribution of land from

428
00:27:04.921 --> 00:27:08.160
the aristocracy to Rome is urban poor and veterans,

429
00:27:08.370 --> 00:27:12.830
both of them would overstep the boundaries of their offices and even Ron from

430
00:27:12.831 --> 00:27:14.880
multiple terms in a row.
Remember,

431
00:27:14.881 --> 00:27:18.780
of course at a console had just a one year term and could not run again for

432
00:27:18.781 --> 00:27:23.370
another 10 years.
Both of them would die in the process that groggy brothers,

433
00:27:23.460 --> 00:27:27.420
while only somewhat successful in themselves highlight at the beginning of

434
00:27:27.421 --> 00:27:29.070
changes to the Roman republic.

435
00:27:29.280 --> 00:27:32.700
That would alter it forever though the waters of the Mediterranean where now

436
00:27:32.701 --> 00:27:33.750
more tranquil.

437
00:27:33.810 --> 00:27:37.890
The Romans never ignored that threats which could come from the mysterious
north.

438
00:27:37.950 --> 00:27:42.330
And that is around this time that the Romans encounter another hostile European

439
00:27:42.331 --> 00:27:47.331
people who would in time prove themselves to be as fearsome and more challenging

440
00:27:47.761 --> 00:27:51.000
to the Romans.
And even the Celts that Gary Amani,

441
00:27:51.210 --> 00:27:54.780
but Germans around the year one 13 BC,

442
00:27:54.810 --> 00:27:59.810
three Germanic tribes in particular with Celtic mixture,
the Kimberley to Tony's,

443
00:27:59.820 --> 00:28:04.680
and then bronies began moving south in search of more hospitable lands.

444
00:28:04.800 --> 00:28:07.200
As they approached Roman territory,
they assume,

445
00:28:07.201 --> 00:28:09.510
proved willing to actually turn around.

446
00:28:09.720 --> 00:28:12.690
The tribes had likely heard of the great power of the Romans,

447
00:28:12.691 --> 00:28:16.560
and when they were asked to negotiate by Niosh,
[inaudible] was carbo.

448
00:28:16.590 --> 00:28:20.310
They did so and agreed to leave foolishly carbo.

449
00:28:20.520 --> 00:28:23.700
Either they believe in these invaders to be a threat or eager to obtain a

450
00:28:23.701 --> 00:28:25.170
glorious victory in battle.

451
00:28:25.230 --> 00:28:29.700
Planned an ambush around the paths through which the tribe said they would be

452
00:28:29.701 --> 00:28:32.370
leaving.
The tribe's learned about this,
however,

453
00:28:32.371 --> 00:28:35.130
and we're prepared for the ambush.
When it came,

454
00:28:35.190 --> 00:28:38.820
the resulting battle of Noria was a disaster for the Romans,

455
00:28:38.940 --> 00:28:42.900
the majority of the room,
and Forrest was destroyed and carbo barely escaped.

456
00:28:43.170 --> 00:28:48.170
In one o five BC that Armani returned and the Roman sent an even larger force to

457
00:28:48.421 --> 00:28:53.220
the northwest to deal with them under two generals,
[inaudible] and maximus.

458
00:28:53.430 --> 00:28:57.930
These two men were from different social classes and often did not see eye to

459
00:28:57.931 --> 00:29:02.490
eye.
When it became evident that maximus of a lower social class was planning to

460
00:29:02.491 --> 00:29:04.590
negotiate a truce with the German tribes.

461
00:29:04.670 --> 00:29:08.970
Kpo of the upperclass ordered his half of the army to attack the Germans.

462
00:29:09.060 --> 00:29:13.290
The resulting battle of a Roseo was a disaster for the Romans,

463
00:29:13.530 --> 00:29:18.530
like at Kenai bravado was to blame for the egregious error that caused the Roman

464
00:29:18.601 --> 00:29:20.820
armies to be divided and annihilated.

465
00:29:20.880 --> 00:29:24.480
The Romans lost around 120,000 men here,

466
00:29:24.540 --> 00:29:27.180
maybe even 60,000 more than that can I?

467
00:29:27.210 --> 00:29:32.210
With the Germanic tribes losing only around 15,000 in terms of total men lost

468
00:29:32.670 --> 00:29:35.070
the worst defeat in Roman history.

469
00:29:35.190 --> 00:29:40.190
Yet Rome would recover and put a man named Gaius Marius on the scene.

470
00:29:40.500 --> 00:29:45.040
Gaius.
Marius had recently proven himself as a commander in North Africa and had

471
00:29:45.041 --> 00:29:48.490
already served as console once the Roman Senate.
However,

472
00:29:48.550 --> 00:29:52.930
desperate for strong leadership allowed Maurice to serve again as console and

473
00:29:52.931 --> 00:29:54.070
one o four BC.

474
00:29:54.100 --> 00:29:59.100
He would be reelected four more times consecutively and wood in total serve as

475
00:30:00.071 --> 00:30:04.300
console seven times in his life.
Why?
Well,
simply put,

476
00:30:04.510 --> 00:30:06.640
he knew what he was doing.
Surprisingly,

477
00:30:06.790 --> 00:30:11.740
the Armani did not attack Rome after Roseo.
Instead they moved off to Hispana.

478
00:30:11.890 --> 00:30:16.210
Mario has capitalized on this luck and used it as an opportunity to reorganize

479
00:30:16.211 --> 00:30:19.030
the Roman army down to its very basic structure.

480
00:30:19.210 --> 00:30:23.830
He made it a standing army as opposed to one which was called up during times of

481
00:30:23.831 --> 00:30:25.900
war,
but perhaps more importantly,

482
00:30:25.960 --> 00:30:30.700
we organize the laws surrounding entrance into it prior to this and individual

483
00:30:30.701 --> 00:30:34.210
had to hold a certain amount of land to join the army.

484
00:30:34.300 --> 00:30:39.070
The intention here was to ensure that the interest of the army were in line with

485
00:30:39.071 --> 00:30:43.630
the welfare of the state.
Marius sooner moved all property requirements,

486
00:30:43.690 --> 00:30:45.190
allowing the port enter.

487
00:30:45.220 --> 00:30:48.910
He would also have these soldiers begin carrying their own supplies.

488
00:30:49.060 --> 00:30:52.570
Prior to this,
slaves and animals did this job.

489
00:30:52.810 --> 00:30:57.130
Though this would lead to his soldiers being called muhly Mariani,
Maurice,

490
00:30:57.131 --> 00:31:01.150
his mules,
it made them much more mobile and put them in better shape.

491
00:31:01.180 --> 00:31:05.200
He promised land grants and pensions to these soldiers who completed their term

492
00:31:05.201 --> 00:31:08.530
of service and one of the three BC bigger money return.

493
00:31:08.590 --> 00:31:12.390
Their intention was clear to sack Italy,
but at the Battle of Oak,

494
00:31:12.391 --> 00:31:17.391
why 60 I Mario's proves his reforms were successful and Delta crushing blow to

495
00:31:17.831 --> 00:31:22.831
them killing 90,000 and enslaving another 20,002 years later,

496
00:31:23.110 --> 00:31:27.640
they met at the battle of where Kelly,
where Marius was again,
greatly successful,

497
00:31:27.700 --> 00:31:32.700
taking very few losses but killing perhaps 60,000 Kimberly and effectively

498
00:31:32.921 --> 00:31:34.690
ending the Kimberley and war.

499
00:31:34.750 --> 00:31:39.370
Marius was a hero and bore this title proudly and his political life,

500
00:31:39.430 --> 00:31:42.160
but those successful in his military pursuits,

501
00:31:42.190 --> 00:31:45.310
he was less successful on the field of politics.

502
00:31:45.430 --> 00:31:50.050
He sought to retain his power at times resorting to bribery and assassination to

503
00:31:50.051 --> 00:31:51.760
do so.
Ironically,

504
00:31:51.820 --> 00:31:56.470
his behavior in the political arena would set the stage for the downfall of the

505
00:31:56.471 --> 00:31:58.570
very republic which he had served.

506
00:31:58.780 --> 00:32:02.800
Perhaps one of the most worrying signs of things to come was the mindset of

507
00:32:02.801 --> 00:32:06.250
Mario's.
His soldiers.
He may have served the republic,

508
00:32:06.340 --> 00:32:09.700
but his soldiers served him because generals,

509
00:32:09.701 --> 00:32:13.570
we're now responsible for the welfare and the eventual pensions of their men.

510
00:32:13.660 --> 00:32:18.660
Marius had created an army more loyal to their generals than the government in

511
00:32:18.761 --> 00:32:23.680
Rome in the nineties BC or rebellion and the land surrounding Italy erupted as

512
00:32:23.681 --> 00:32:28.420
the peoples of Rome's client states fought for Roman citizenship after pointless

513
00:32:28.421 --> 00:32:29.020
fighting,

514
00:32:29.020 --> 00:32:33.430
the Senate caved and granted citizenship to the Italian peoples willing to lay

515
00:32:33.431 --> 00:32:35.410
down their arms.
Many agreed,

516
00:32:35.530 --> 00:32:40.250
but the Sam Nian rebels led the group still resisting intending to found their

517
00:32:40.251 --> 00:32:41.084
own state.

518
00:32:41.240 --> 00:32:46.240
Pursuing them was the Roman General Lucas Cornelius Sula Sula as he was known,

519
00:32:47.540 --> 00:32:52.310
was primarily responsible for bringing the social war as it's called to a close

520
00:32:52.340 --> 00:32:57.170
and was made console as a result in 88 BC that same year,

521
00:32:57.200 --> 00:32:59.960
the first myth road datic war broke out in the east,

522
00:33:00.020 --> 00:33:02.000
sparked when the king of Pontus,

523
00:33:02.001 --> 00:33:07.001
a Persian state and modern Anatolia methodologies invaded a Roman territory and

524
00:33:07.311 --> 00:33:12.311
began to kill all Romans in one of history's first genocides Sula as council

525
00:33:13.520 --> 00:33:16.100
prepared to lead an army to deal with this threat,

526
00:33:16.160 --> 00:33:20.000
but he was pushed aside by the now elderly Marius,

527
00:33:20.180 --> 00:33:23.060
who intended to lead one final campaign.

528
00:33:23.150 --> 00:33:27.890
Sula would not stand for this and would end up doing the unthinkable.

529
00:33:27.950 --> 00:33:32.570
He gathered his forces and marched into the city of Rome itself to depose

530
00:33:32.571 --> 00:33:36.680
Morris.
It was illegal,
shocking and sacrilegious even,

531
00:33:36.710 --> 00:33:38.870
but at work and Mario's fled to Africa.

532
00:33:39.050 --> 00:33:43.100
Sulla then took a man of the army again and moved east to deal with the pontic

533
00:33:43.101 --> 00:33:46.190
king.
Why the way,
however,
Maurice and his ally,

534
00:33:46.191 --> 00:33:50.480
Kenna marched on Rome themselves and over through a seller supporters.

535
00:33:50.510 --> 00:33:52.610
However,
Maurice died of old age.

536
00:33:52.611 --> 00:33:56.930
Within a few weeks of his seventh console ship and Kenna will be stoned to death

537
00:33:56.931 --> 00:33:59.540
later on.
Fortunately for Sillas as well,

538
00:33:59.630 --> 00:34:04.400
the warrant in a Toyota was going favorably and he was able to claim a glorious

539
00:34:04.401 --> 00:34:09.080
victory and then return to Rome to take power by defeating his rivals once again

540
00:34:09.081 --> 00:34:10.580
in a brief civil war.

541
00:34:10.730 --> 00:34:14.360
Once his rivals were defeated in Scilla second march on Rome,

542
00:34:14.420 --> 00:34:18.320
Cilla took on a title which none in Roman history had ever before.

543
00:34:18.320 --> 00:34:20.720
Received dictator for life.

544
00:34:21.170 --> 00:34:26.170
Cilla now effectively held absolute power for as long as he wanted though he

545
00:34:26.181 --> 00:34:28.130
ruled cruelly and the end,

546
00:34:28.280 --> 00:34:32.450
much of his work as dictator was spent trying to prevent someone from doing the

547
00:34:32.451 --> 00:34:37.451
same thing he had again and he would resign his dictatorship after just one year

548
00:34:37.790 --> 00:34:40.490
service council for another and then retire,

549
00:34:40.910 --> 00:34:44.180
but his intentions would fail.
Ironically,

550
00:34:44.210 --> 00:34:48.320
he and Maurice had already set the precedent for a new form of government to

551
00:34:48.321 --> 00:34:52.670
arise and the man who would bring about the end of the republic had already been

552
00:34:52.671 --> 00:34:56.690
born.
This man is perhaps the most well known Roman in history.

553
00:34:56.780 --> 00:35:00.530
Gaius Yulia was Kaiser,
Julius Caesar.

554
00:35:03.590 --> 00:35:07.760
The language segment for this video usually included in these documentaries in

555
00:35:07.761 --> 00:35:11.840
which we'll talk about Latin will be made separately after this documentary,

556
00:35:11.841 --> 00:35:12.950
so stay tuned for that.

557
00:35:13.040 --> 00:35:17.450
The first century BC was an eventful time in Roman history.

558
00:35:17.510 --> 00:35:21.440
Two more Mithra detic wars were fought in the modern day,
Middle East.

559
00:35:21.560 --> 00:35:24.380
They were quite draining and to make matters worse,

560
00:35:24.381 --> 00:35:27.200
in 73 BC as slave uprising,

561
00:35:27.260 --> 00:35:30.740
led by a former Thracian gladiator named Spartacus,

562
00:35:30.810 --> 00:35:35.480
that place which spiraled out of control becoming a genuine rebellion and was

563
00:35:35.481 --> 00:35:39.420
only put down by Marcus [inaudible] Crassus in 71 BC,

564
00:35:39.600 --> 00:35:42.750
a separate revolt occurred in Iberia around the same time,

565
00:35:42.840 --> 00:35:46.270
which was put down by a general named Niaz Pompeius,

566
00:35:46.530 --> 00:35:49.950
better known as Pompei,
both classes and pump pay.

567
00:35:49.951 --> 00:35:51.660
We're making names for themselves.

568
00:35:51.870 --> 00:35:56.760
The two would both service console and 70 to 69 BC and metro detic wars in the

569
00:35:56.761 --> 00:36:01.761
east finally came to a close in 63 BC and Rome subsequently expanded further and

570
00:36:02.551 --> 00:36:07.290
to Anatolia and the Middle East having to feed Pontiss and Armenia from pay for

571
00:36:07.291 --> 00:36:11.580
the Moore was active in the region and took the city of Jerusalem that year.

572
00:36:11.790 --> 00:36:16.040
This was also the same year that the great Roman orator,
Kiko,

573
00:36:16.200 --> 00:36:18.960
or an English Cicero was made console.

574
00:36:19.110 --> 00:36:21.180
They'll way controversial figure of his day.

575
00:36:21.360 --> 00:36:25.680
He would spend his career defending Rome and even protected it from a takeover

576
00:36:25.681 --> 00:36:30.660
by a rival named Catalina.
This was as we've seen,
not the first to Teton Rome,

577
00:36:30.730 --> 00:36:31.770
northern last.

578
00:36:31.860 --> 00:36:35.580
The political situation we have been discussing was creating a hostile

579
00:36:35.581 --> 00:36:39.450
environment in Rome,
bribery and corruption,
assassinations of violence,

580
00:36:39.510 --> 00:36:42.630
street gang violence and general disorder.
We're all common.

581
00:36:42.720 --> 00:36:46.860
It is in this turbulent environment that the aforementioned leaders crassness

582
00:36:46.861 --> 00:36:51.270
and Pompei join forces with another political star.
Julius Caesar.

583
00:36:51.840 --> 00:36:54.720
Caesar was from a family of minor nobility.

584
00:36:54.750 --> 00:36:59.610
He was well educated and had a talent for writing and oratory and was involved

585
00:36:59.611 --> 00:37:03.510
in politics and the military early on by 60 BC.

586
00:37:03.600 --> 00:37:07.620
He was around the age of 40 and seeking higher political office.

587
00:37:07.770 --> 00:37:12.450
It is in this year that he joins forces with pump pay and crosses in a political

588
00:37:12.451 --> 00:37:17.451
alliance known as the first triumvirate as Rome's most powerful figures.

589
00:37:17.550 --> 00:37:21.990
The alliance quickly saw some success and Caesar was made console alongside

590
00:37:21.991 --> 00:37:26.340
Marcus called Peroneus BBU loose.
Those Caesar soon held full authority.

591
00:37:26.640 --> 00:37:31.410
Caesar was just getting started in 58 BC.
The infamous gallic wars began.

592
00:37:31.560 --> 00:37:35.430
It is here where Cedar truly made a name for himself as he waged war and

593
00:37:35.431 --> 00:37:38.610
expanded into the territory of the galls of modern France,

594
00:37:38.640 --> 00:37:42.240
while also encountering a number of Germanic peoples along the way.

595
00:37:42.420 --> 00:37:47.100
These wars would last for eight years and he would even venture into Britain and

596
00:37:47.101 --> 00:37:51.180
your Manea.
Though his gains there would be less permanent throughout these wars.

597
00:37:51.240 --> 00:37:55.110
Cesar would find a number of competent and trustworthy allies,

598
00:37:55.260 --> 00:37:57.330
including Marcus Antonius,

599
00:37:57.410 --> 00:38:02.410
better known in English as Marc Antony Caesars access here is largely ode to his

600
00:38:02.491 --> 00:38:03.900
skill as a commander.

601
00:38:03.990 --> 00:38:07.890
He was an excellent commander and motivator and often entered battle,

602
00:38:07.891 --> 00:38:12.390
not from the back as an observer,
but from the front alongside his men.

603
00:38:12.630 --> 00:38:16.650
I've mentioned before that this was a period where the army's sort of had more

604
00:38:16.651 --> 00:38:20.550
loyalty to their own generals than the nation because of the roles they're

605
00:38:20.551 --> 00:38:24.180
general would play,
but this was a more personal loyalty.

606
00:38:24.360 --> 00:38:28.470
Consider what it would mean to you as someone in during the life of a soldier

607
00:38:28.500 --> 00:38:29.940
campaigning in a colder,

608
00:38:29.941 --> 00:38:34.941
mysterious land against armies of ferocious larger men who oftentimes spot naked

609
00:38:35.320 --> 00:38:40.060
seemingly without a fear of death and brutal up close and personal and the hand

610
00:38:40.061 --> 00:38:44.200
comment and standing there right by your side in the heat of battle is your

611
00:38:44.201 --> 00:38:46.540
commanding officer facing the struggle with you,

612
00:38:46.630 --> 00:38:49.480
not willing to send you into something that he would not.

613
00:38:49.481 --> 00:38:54.460
Also in deer that spoke volumes to his men.
In the latter half of these wars,

614
00:38:54.490 --> 00:38:56.800
Caesar's suffered a string of bad luck.

615
00:38:56.920 --> 00:39:00.160
His success in foreign lens brought concern back home.

616
00:39:00.340 --> 00:39:04.480
A man who could wield so much power and authority could pose a serious threat to

617
00:39:04.481 --> 00:39:07.390
the welfare of the republic.
In 53 BC,

618
00:39:07.420 --> 00:39:09.640
the triumvirate itself began to break down.

619
00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:15.000
Crassus died while campaigning in Syria at the battle of car high against the

620
00:39:15.160 --> 00:39:15.170
Parthians Caesar,

621
00:39:15.170 --> 00:39:19.980
his daughter and pump his wife Julia had died shortly before this and palm pays

622
00:39:19.981 --> 00:39:24.610
seem now to be less interested in alliance and more interested in furthering his

623
00:39:24.611 --> 00:39:25.330
own career,

624
00:39:25.330 --> 00:39:30.010
making him Caesar's rival political tension erupted into violence and even the

625
00:39:30.011 --> 00:39:32.710
Roman Senate building burned in a fire pump.

626
00:39:32.711 --> 00:39:36.640
Pay will become sole console in 52 BC.
Meanwhile,

627
00:39:36.641 --> 00:39:39.110
Caesar still caught up campaigning in Romans.

628
00:39:39.111 --> 00:39:42.730
Frontier suddenly found himself up against a new opponent,

629
00:39:42.880 --> 00:39:47.740
the Great Celtic leader first and get her originally a leader of only a single

630
00:39:47.741 --> 00:39:51.970
gallic tribe first and get our expert form alliances with numerous others and

631
00:39:51.971 --> 00:39:56.140
led a United rebellion against the Roman occupation first and get her ex was

632
00:39:56.141 --> 00:40:00.040
initially quite successful and pursued a war of attrition against the Romans,

633
00:40:00.070 --> 00:40:03.940
which wore them down.
He would even defeat Caesar at the battle of gear via.

634
00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:05.860
However,
in 52 BC,

635
00:40:06.010 --> 00:40:09.720
Cesar would defeat the goal is once and for all at the battle of Elisa.

636
00:40:09.970 --> 00:40:10.870
Following this,

637
00:40:10.900 --> 00:40:15.430
the gallic wars started to come to a slow halt and Modern Day France was

638
00:40:15.431 --> 00:40:17.770
incorporated into the Roman Empire.

639
00:40:17.860 --> 00:40:20.650
Caesar then returned to Rome to deal with matters there.

640
00:40:20.710 --> 00:40:24.640
The Senate demanded Caesar dispend his army before returning to the city,

641
00:40:24.670 --> 00:40:29.670
but Caesar had other intentions upon crossing the Rubicon River in northern

642
00:40:29.681 --> 00:40:30.310
Italy.

643
00:40:30.310 --> 00:40:34.600
He had broken the law by marching into the heartland with his forces before the

644
00:40:34.601 --> 00:40:36.790
fateful crossing.
He is said to have said,

645
00:40:36.980 --> 00:40:40.030
I'll AI [inaudible] the die is cast.

646
00:40:40.180 --> 00:40:44.650
Cesar knew where this would lead yet another civil war on the opposing end,

647
00:40:44.680 --> 00:40:47.860
his old friend pump pay who fled the grease upon his arrival,

648
00:40:48.010 --> 00:40:51.670
he sees her med palm paid there at forest soulless where despite being

649
00:40:51.671 --> 00:40:56.080
outnumbered two to one Caesar defeated a pump,
a pump,
hey then flood to Egypt,

650
00:40:56.170 --> 00:41:00.310
but he was murdered by Caesars Egyptian supporters before he could catch up to

651
00:41:00.311 --> 00:41:04.810
him.
It is here where Caesar met the Egyptian queen of the Ptolemaic Dynasty.

652
00:41:04.930 --> 00:41:09.880
That is to say a descendant of the Greek rulers of Ancient Egypt,
Cleopatra,

653
00:41:10.060 --> 00:41:15.060
Caesar and Cleopatra would develop a close relationship here of a political and

654
00:41:15.220 --> 00:41:17.800
intimate nature and she would even bear him.

655
00:41:17.801 --> 00:41:22.450
A son [inaudible] in 46 BC with his rivals aside,

656
00:41:22.630 --> 00:41:26.710
Cesar would become more than just another general who had marched on Rome.

657
00:41:26.740 --> 00:41:31.300
He would be named dictator for life and was contented to remain as such,

658
00:41:31.390 --> 00:41:36.380
but much of the Roman elite,
including Caesars former friends such as Marcus,

659
00:41:36.381 --> 00:41:40.910
you and Eos,
Brutus,
we're firmly against him fearing the return of a king.

660
00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:43.580
On March 15th 44 BC,

661
00:41:43.600 --> 00:41:46.490
I date known as the ides of March 40 or so.

662
00:41:46.491 --> 00:41:51.320
Senators led by Brutus acted on their fears of the new dictator and surrounded

663
00:41:51.350 --> 00:41:55.250
and stab Caesar to death,
though Shakespeare claims.
Otherwise,

664
00:41:55.370 --> 00:41:59.960
historical sources say Cesar fell silently in shock covering his face with his

665
00:41:59.961 --> 00:42:02.810
toga.
Instability followed Caesar's death.

666
00:42:02.930 --> 00:42:06.080
The republic would not return to its prior state.
Rather,

667
00:42:06.290 --> 00:42:08.930
different factions arose to claim succession.

668
00:42:08.980 --> 00:42:13.490
Marc Antony Caesars former comrade had effectively taken control of Rome

669
00:42:13.520 --> 00:42:15.140
following the incident.
However,

670
00:42:15.141 --> 00:42:18.280
it soon emerge that Caesar had named an heir to his fortunes.

671
00:42:18.370 --> 00:42:22.670
Gaius [inaudible],
an English Octavius,

672
00:42:22.730 --> 00:42:26.510
his grandnephew,
whom he had adopted as his son and his will.

673
00:42:26.630 --> 00:42:30.620
Octavia has posed a significant challenge to Marc Antony briefly.

674
00:42:30.650 --> 00:42:34.610
They fought it out,
however,
with a Senate trying to undo them both.

675
00:42:34.640 --> 00:42:37.820
In 44 BC,
they joined forces with Marcus.

676
00:42:37.821 --> 00:42:41.090
I Emilia was labored to us to form the second triumvirate.

677
00:42:41.150 --> 00:42:45.110
The second triumvirate would take control of Rome and the three would share

678
00:42:45.111 --> 00:42:46.760
power as dictators.

679
00:42:46.910 --> 00:42:51.740
Octavius a frail 19 year old boy was initially the weakest of the three,

680
00:42:51.800 --> 00:42:55.430
but he would soon prove to be much more ambitious and cunning than its

681
00:42:55.431 --> 00:42:59.360
counterparts had imagined in 42 BC,
Octavius and Anthony,

682
00:42:59.361 --> 00:43:03.320
to feed it a sentence forces at the battle of Philippi in Greece.
Here,

683
00:43:03.470 --> 00:43:07.340
Brutus and Cassius Caesar as a main assassins,
died in battle.

684
00:43:07.370 --> 00:43:11.930
They would also pursue and kill other hostile senators such as Cicero with the

685
00:43:11.931 --> 00:43:13.910
Republican leaders.
Out of the way,

686
00:43:13.940 --> 00:43:16.700
the three divided the empire between themselves.

687
00:43:17.030 --> 00:43:21.590
Tony took the east Octavius,
the West,
and [inaudible] Africa.
Though,

688
00:43:21.591 --> 00:43:25.940
in 36 PC Octavius would take control of lipidosis territory himself.

689
00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:30.650
Meanwhile,
in the east,
Antony prepared to take on Parthenia to do so.

690
00:43:30.710 --> 00:43:33.560
He had secure the support of local client leaders.

691
00:43:33.680 --> 00:43:37.730
One such client leader was Cleopatra,
much like with Caesar,

692
00:43:37.960 --> 00:43:41.840
the two fell in love and would later have children.
By 32 BC.

693
00:43:41.870 --> 00:43:46.870
The larger inevitable conflict started to brew as Octavius and Anthony became

694
00:43:47.001 --> 00:43:51.500
hostile toward each other and each sought total absolute control of the empire.

695
00:43:51.650 --> 00:43:55.610
The war that erupted is often known as the final war of the republic.

696
00:43:55.730 --> 00:43:59.750
It would last for two years and would come to its conclusion at the naval battle

697
00:43:59.780 --> 00:44:04.100
of Actium where Octavius defeated Antony and Cleopatra is forces.

698
00:44:04.340 --> 00:44:09.340
The two lovers later committed suicide and Octavius took on full control of the

699
00:44:09.620 --> 00:44:12.410
Roman Empire.
Now in his thirties with this great victory,

700
00:44:12.560 --> 00:44:17.560
Octavius would simply known as our Wooster's Augustus Caesar Rome's first

701
00:44:17.811 --> 00:44:18.950
emperor Romans,

702
00:44:18.951 --> 00:44:23.870
now in 27 BC to be exact at true empire with a true emperor.

703
00:44:23.960 --> 00:44:26.600
Yet it retained its Republican psychology.

704
00:44:26.660 --> 00:44:30.800
It was a nation of the Roman Senate and people working in unison.

705
00:44:30.830 --> 00:44:33.510
That's the image Augustus wanted to display anyway.

706
00:44:33.670 --> 00:44:37.620
Augustus never dare to call himself a rex king.
Rather,

707
00:44:37.680 --> 00:44:42.300
he simply perpetually held multiple powerful offices and stack the Senate in his

708
00:44:42.301 --> 00:44:46.500
favor,
which gave him absolute power.
He preferred the title preen caves,

709
00:44:46.530 --> 00:44:50.880
Kiwi totties,
the first citizen,
a formerly senatorial title,

710
00:44:51.420 --> 00:44:53.100
along with being the first emperor.

711
00:44:53.130 --> 00:44:58.080
He would also be the longest ruling over a United Rome anyway and would have one

712
00:44:58.081 --> 00:45:02.400
of the most eventful and important rains in Roman history.
His reign march,

713
00:45:02.410 --> 00:45:06.570
the beginning of what is known as POCs or Romana the Roman peace.

714
00:45:06.780 --> 00:45:10.920
This was a period of relative peace and stability in Roman history,

715
00:45:10.921 --> 00:45:13.110
which would last for over 200 years.

716
00:45:13.200 --> 00:45:16.080
It was not a time of complete peace instability.

717
00:45:16.140 --> 00:45:18.180
There were regular conflicts and wars,

718
00:45:18.210 --> 00:45:22.410
but they were primarily fought outside of Rome and without much damage done to

719
00:45:22.411 --> 00:45:26.940
the empire within.
It is under Augustus that in the modern nation of Israel,

720
00:45:27.090 --> 00:45:31.620
Jesus of Nazareth was born though his birth is what traditionally divides the

721
00:45:31.621 --> 00:45:35.700
calendar between BC before Christ and 80 [inaudible].

722
00:45:35.790 --> 00:45:38.520
He was actually likely born around four BC.

723
00:45:38.640 --> 00:45:42.900
Jesus Christ is easily one of the most important figures in human history.

724
00:45:42.960 --> 00:45:45.540
His followers today would say the most important.

725
00:45:45.570 --> 00:45:49.530
I plan to cover his story and other religions in future videos.
For now though,

726
00:45:49.531 --> 00:45:53.940
it will suffice to say that his teachings would go on to become the religion of

727
00:45:54.090 --> 00:45:57.990
Christianity,
which would shake the Roman Empire to its core.
However,

728
00:45:58.050 --> 00:46:02.430
Caesar Augustus would never hear his name for the moment the only son of God and

729
00:46:02.431 --> 00:46:05.340
the Roman empire was Augustus.
His adoptive father,

730
00:46:05.341 --> 00:46:08.040
Julius had essentially been deified by now.

731
00:46:08.160 --> 00:46:13.050
Jesus Christ was crucified around the year 38 d and died shortly after.
Though,

732
00:46:13.051 --> 00:46:13.550
of course,

733
00:46:13.550 --> 00:46:17.580
central to the Christian religion is the belief that he rose from the dead three

734
00:46:17.581 --> 00:46:20.910
days later,
despite being regarded as the bringer of POCs.

735
00:46:20.930 --> 00:46:24.180
Armana Augustus would fight a number of wars throughout his life.

736
00:46:24.210 --> 00:46:27.300
It was his belief that Rome would be in a turtle nation,

737
00:46:27.301 --> 00:46:30.690
which ruled the whole world and expanded into the Balkans,

738
00:46:30.720 --> 00:46:35.340
the Near East Africa and the rest of Iberia.
His most famous horse,
however,

739
00:46:35.341 --> 00:46:36.870
her fought in Germany.

740
00:46:36.900 --> 00:46:40.320
They're Manea was the frontier of the known world to the Romans.

741
00:46:40.560 --> 00:46:44.220
Had was in this age,
mysterious on developed and alien,

742
00:46:44.310 --> 00:46:49.080
likely much more so than even Gaul and 12 VC campaigns into mock nugget of
money.

743
00:46:49.081 --> 00:46:53.700
I began.
Rome began a process of aligning themselves with the dramatic chiefs and

744
00:46:53.701 --> 00:46:57.330
bringing them under Roman rule and law.
To accomplish this,

745
00:46:57.360 --> 00:47:01.980
some dramatic chief's sons were taken as hostages in a sense to be raised in

746
00:47:01.981 --> 00:47:06.720
Rome as Romans and return to gear Manea as leaders sympathetic to Rome.

747
00:47:06.830 --> 00:47:10.130
One such German was a boy who the Romans would call our minis,

748
00:47:10.200 --> 00:47:12.840
who grew up in the Roman army,
climbing the ranks quickly.

749
00:47:12.900 --> 00:47:17.100
What the reputation of being a fine soldier when our mini [inaudible] was asked

750
00:47:17.101 --> 00:47:21.240
to accompany the Roman General Puglia's Quintilian is waters into gear Manea on

751
00:47:21.241 --> 00:47:25.740
a campaign in seven eight d he was suddenly forced to choose between his Roman

752
00:47:25.741 --> 00:47:30.670
life and his German life.
In September of nine eight d his choice was made.

753
00:47:30.760 --> 00:47:35.710
Arminius secretly became a military leader of his people and trick the Romans

754
00:47:35.711 --> 00:47:40.600
into passing through a swampy,
heavily forested route to suppress a fake revolt.

755
00:47:40.630 --> 00:47:41.290
Here,

756
00:47:41.290 --> 00:47:45.790
Arminius and his men were able to ambush them and to feed them decisively and

757
00:47:45.791 --> 00:47:50.530
the battle of the two dimeric forest known to the Romans as cloud days Wadiana,

758
00:47:50.590 --> 00:47:54.910
the Varian disaster,
what is and 20,000 of his men were killed.

759
00:47:54.960 --> 00:47:58.210
The survivors were tortured and ritualistic be sacrificed.

760
00:47:58.270 --> 00:47:59.920
When Augustus heard of this defeat,

761
00:47:59.980 --> 00:48:03.370
he evidently began to bang his head on doors and screamed,

762
00:48:03.490 --> 00:48:07.120
queen titty [inaudible].
They won't sred quintile these Walrus.

763
00:48:07.180 --> 00:48:10.840
Give me back my legions.
Why all the losses here were major.

764
00:48:10.930 --> 00:48:15.790
They were only a fraction of what was lost at Kenai or Rossio and comparison.

765
00:48:15.940 --> 00:48:16.990
Nevertheless,

766
00:48:17.050 --> 00:48:21.100
some historians placed at two to Barrick forest as a Rome's greatest defeat

767
00:48:21.130 --> 00:48:23.440
because of the effect that had on the empire.

768
00:48:23.560 --> 00:48:27.250
The frontier was set at the Rhine River.
The Romans would cross it,

769
00:48:27.280 --> 00:48:29.470
but never really ruled the land beyond.

770
00:48:29.680 --> 00:48:34.680
Augustus died in August of 14 a d age 75 his reign was profound,

771
00:48:35.560 --> 00:48:37.000
but who would succeed it?

772
00:48:37.240 --> 00:48:41.230
The Roman emperors would not always behave like the later European monarch who

773
00:48:41.231 --> 00:48:42.850
often left their rule to family.

774
00:48:42.880 --> 00:48:47.320
Generally the eldest son leaving rural to a family member was coming,

775
00:48:47.350 --> 00:48:51.520
but there was never a single clear way in which the Roman emperors were chosen.

776
00:48:51.550 --> 00:48:56.110
Largely because the Romans never stopped seeing themselves as a republic effect,

777
00:48:56.111 --> 00:48:58.210
which will become a huge problem in the future.

778
00:48:58.240 --> 00:49:01.930
Leading to a number of civil wars in general,
political strife,

779
00:49:01.990 --> 00:49:04.870
the rural did often go to a family member.

780
00:49:04.900 --> 00:49:09.280
The approval of the government and military was also crucial.
In this instance,

781
00:49:09.400 --> 00:49:14.080
the succession did peacefully fall to Augustus's adopted son Tubarius.

782
00:49:14.170 --> 00:49:19.170
He in the next three emperors were all family and thus this is regarded as the

783
00:49:20.380 --> 00:49:21.940
Julio Claudine Dynasty by Historian T.

784
00:49:21.940 --> 00:49:24.100
Barriers was a skillful commander in the past,

785
00:49:24.101 --> 00:49:28.930
but quite noticeably did not enjoy the position of emperor and achieved much

786
00:49:28.931 --> 00:49:33.460
less than his predecessors.
He would die hated by the people as a paranoid,

787
00:49:33.461 --> 00:49:38.461
frugal and ineffective ruler in 37 eight d probably kill the by his successor.

788
00:49:39.100 --> 00:49:42.010
His successor would be even worse.
In fact,

789
00:49:42.160 --> 00:49:47.160
insane Emperor Caligula is known to many as one of history's most absurd rulers.

790
00:49:47.580 --> 00:49:50.590
It is uncertain which stories about him are true.

791
00:49:50.650 --> 00:49:52.720
The sources aren't always reliable,

792
00:49:52.750 --> 00:49:57.100
but according to stories brought his horse to a dinner and threatened to make

793
00:49:57.101 --> 00:50:01.630
him a console and pregnant at his sister claimed to be a god killed innocent

794
00:50:01.631 --> 00:50:04.630
people for Amusement and declared war on the God Neptune.

795
00:50:04.660 --> 00:50:08.170
Having a sodas collect seashells on the coast as a war bounty.

796
00:50:08.250 --> 00:50:11.210
Caligula is often portrayed as an incoherent madman,

797
00:50:11.260 --> 00:50:14.950
but modern historians suggest there was a method to his madness.

798
00:50:15.020 --> 00:50:18.660
The horse console incident was likely a way to humiliate the Senate,

799
00:50:18.680 --> 00:50:21.880
which challenged him a way of showing how unimportant they were to him.

800
00:50:21.930 --> 00:50:26.230
The seashell incident was likely to humiliate his soldiers for resisting his

801
00:50:26.231 --> 00:50:30.440
ambitions to cross into Britain and his sexual relations with his sister may

802
00:50:30.441 --> 00:50:34.580
have been influenced by the thinking of the Egyptian Pharaohs were incest was

803
00:50:34.581 --> 00:50:38.660
common.
Caligula was killed by his own body guard.
The praetorian guard,

804
00:50:38.750 --> 00:50:42.920
when he announced he would be moving into Alexandria after just four years of

805
00:50:42.921 --> 00:50:43.730
his reign,

806
00:50:43.730 --> 00:50:48.260
the Praetorian guard would later find Caligula's uncle Claudius hiding behind a

807
00:50:48.261 --> 00:50:51.920
curtain and made him amber.
As we've started to see,

808
00:50:51.921 --> 00:50:56.180
the Roman emperors are a list of very colorful individuals.

809
00:50:56.181 --> 00:50:56.990
To put it simply,

810
00:50:56.990 --> 00:51:01.160
Caligula was not the only emperor to behave or radically as we will see,

811
00:51:01.400 --> 00:51:05.870
and I think that it is important to point out that for every great Roman emperor

812
00:51:05.960 --> 00:51:07.490
who held the empire together,

813
00:51:07.520 --> 00:51:10.370
there was another terrible one who nearly tore it apart.

814
00:51:10.640 --> 00:51:15.170
Claudius intended to finish what Julius Caesar had started and Caligula fail to

815
00:51:15.171 --> 00:51:15.500
do,

816
00:51:15.500 --> 00:51:20.500
conquer the mysterious island of Britannia and 43 eight d an invasion force was

817
00:51:20.931 --> 00:51:22.970
sent to the island that year.

818
00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:27.170
The Romans like the established a settlement that they called London Iom

819
00:51:27.380 --> 00:51:29.030
compared to pass conquest.

820
00:51:29.150 --> 00:51:33.650
The invasion of Britain would be a slow process taking around 40 years and

821
00:51:33.651 --> 00:51:35.090
nearly ending into feet.

822
00:51:35.120 --> 00:51:39.200
Claudius had made important conquests and political alliances in Britain.

823
00:51:39.320 --> 00:51:41.310
He died in 53 Aidy,

824
00:51:41.450 --> 00:51:46.130
possibly poisoned by his own wife and was followed by Emperor Nero.

825
00:51:46.280 --> 00:51:49.940
Nero Nero would be remembered as yet another corrupt,

826
00:51:49.941 --> 00:51:53.900
insane emperor he inherited and continued to the conquest of Britain.

827
00:51:54.080 --> 00:51:56.000
There in the [inaudible] 68 [inaudible],

828
00:51:56.030 --> 00:51:59.300
the king of a tribe known as the e Kenny or Roman ally,

829
00:51:59.330 --> 00:52:03.950
prospect Targus died and left half his kingdom to Rome and the other half to his

830
00:52:03.951 --> 00:52:04.580
daughters.

831
00:52:04.580 --> 00:52:09.080
The Romans ignore this and annexed all of the territory from prospect tog is his

832
00:52:09.081 --> 00:52:12.230
wife protested.
She was beaten and her daughters were raped.

833
00:52:12.350 --> 00:52:16.310
His wife would not forget this treatment and she rose to challenge the Romans in

834
00:52:16.311 --> 00:52:20.210
revolt,
her name was Boudica,
more properly pronounced Boudica.

835
00:52:20.300 --> 00:52:23.150
Boudica would rally not only hurry Kenny tribe,

836
00:52:23.180 --> 00:52:28.020
but also another tribe that Trina avant aes who rebellion around the year 68 d

837
00:52:28.100 --> 00:52:31.730
they would attack and burn a number of Roman settlements,
including Londinium.

838
00:52:31.790 --> 00:52:36.230
But in 61 80 her forces were defeated at the battle of watling street.

839
00:52:36.290 --> 00:52:38.030
Shortly after [inaudible] died,

840
00:52:38.120 --> 00:52:43.120
possibly from suicide or also sickness and 64 80 a great fire devastated much of

841
00:52:44.031 --> 00:52:48.110
the city of Rome.
Many claimed Nero started the fire.
It is uncertain now.

842
00:52:48.111 --> 00:52:48.831
This is true,

843
00:52:48.831 --> 00:52:53.750
but either way he blamed the fire on an emerging religious minority.
Christians.

844
00:52:53.840 --> 00:52:57.500
Many were tortured and executed.
As a result.
This was not in euros,

845
00:52:57.501 --> 00:53:01.310
only act of cruelty and his behavior would lead to him being forced to commit

846
00:53:01.311 --> 00:53:04.840
suicide to avoid assassination and 68 Aidy.

847
00:53:04.940 --> 00:53:09.710
Thus came an end to the Julio,
Claudia and dentisty as Nero had no clear air.

848
00:53:10.160 --> 00:53:14.240
The year 69 subsequently became the year of the four emperors,

849
00:53:14.340 --> 00:53:19.280
has four emperors each,
tried to secure a stable rain until Tito's flowers.

850
00:53:19.370 --> 00:53:23.270
We SpatialOS better known as a space alien.
Accomplish this.

851
00:53:23.420 --> 00:53:24.980
[inaudible] was a respected,

852
00:53:25.710 --> 00:53:29.640
known for his service in the initial invasions of Britain and victories over the

853
00:53:29.641 --> 00:53:31.110
Jewish revolts in Syria.

854
00:53:31.200 --> 00:53:35.340
Though a pragmatic and frugal man who never dreamed he would become emperor.

855
00:53:35.430 --> 00:53:38.010
When he did,
he brought stability back to Rome,

856
00:53:38.040 --> 00:53:41.970
which had been lost in the past year of competing emperors in past decades of

857
00:53:41.971 --> 00:53:45.120
psychopathic emperors.
He introduced new taxes,

858
00:53:45.150 --> 00:53:49.080
built a number of structures including the still standing Colosseum in Rome and

859
00:53:49.081 --> 00:53:50.790
reignited the war in Britain,

860
00:53:50.940 --> 00:53:54.630
the spacey and died in [inaudible] 79 and after his 10 year reign,

861
00:53:54.660 --> 00:53:58.590
he was followed by his son.
Tito's though Tito's ruled for only two years,

862
00:53:58.650 --> 00:54:00.420
it was an eventful two years.

863
00:54:00.480 --> 00:54:03.360
It was under him that the greater eruption of Mount Vesuvius occurred.

864
00:54:03.540 --> 00:54:07.710
He died from fever and 81 80 and rural pass through his younger brother,

865
00:54:07.840 --> 00:54:12.750
[inaudible] Domitian emission would rule for 15 years completing the works of

866
00:54:12.751 --> 00:54:14.670
his father and brother under him.

867
00:54:14.730 --> 00:54:19.030
The Roman General Agricola pushed further into Britain even briefly ruling over

868
00:54:19.080 --> 00:54:22.140
much of Caledonia Modern Day Scotland.
Importantly,

869
00:54:22.320 --> 00:54:24.870
he ruled Rome during the first doc in war.

870
00:54:24.930 --> 00:54:29.910
The doc Ian's were in ancient people living in modern day Romania in 87 eight d

871
00:54:29.911 --> 00:54:34.911
led by a king named Deka Ball in the war of 86 to 88 80 but doc Ian's would

872
00:54:35.821 --> 00:54:40.710
actually end up defeating Rome doc yet gained Roman recognition and became one

873
00:54:40.711 --> 00:54:43.260
of the most powerful kingdoms on the Roman border,

874
00:54:43.290 --> 00:54:47.220
partially because of the aid and funding Domitian provided them to keep them off

875
00:54:47.230 --> 00:54:51.210
rooms.
Back in 96 a d Domitian was assassinated.

876
00:54:51.240 --> 00:54:56.240
His successor Nerva died two years later and in 98 and a man named ty Ono's

877
00:54:56.910 --> 00:54:59.130
Trajan became amber Trajan,

878
00:54:59.160 --> 00:55:03.060
had been a successful commander and servant of the mission who had put down a

879
00:55:03.061 --> 00:55:07.590
revolt and gear Manea and had even served as console as a reward upon becoming

880
00:55:07.620 --> 00:55:08.280
emperor.

881
00:55:08.280 --> 00:55:12.510
It was clear he would not have the same faults as Domitian and got to work to

882
00:55:12.511 --> 00:55:14.130
secure the empire.
His integrity,

883
00:55:14.160 --> 00:55:19.050
his first target doc yet and one o one eight d Trajan defeated the documents at

884
00:55:19.051 --> 00:55:22.890
the second battle of the Pie,
the same location where a decade earlier,

885
00:55:22.920 --> 00:55:25.500
the mission's generals had been defeated.
It's like a ball.

886
00:55:25.501 --> 00:55:26.550
As soon as they're rendered.

887
00:55:26.580 --> 00:55:30.240
The former treaty between docusign and Rome was ended and that Kabbalists became

888
00:55:30.241 --> 00:55:32.580
a subordinate client king.
However,

889
00:55:32.640 --> 00:55:37.050
Deka boss would use this piece to reorganize and prepare for another war with

890
00:55:37.051 --> 00:55:40.050
Rome by preparing for war and inciting rebellion.

891
00:55:40.140 --> 00:55:44.790
Trajan attacked again at one oh five 80 and at the battle of Somme Mesic Tusa

892
00:55:44.820 --> 00:55:48.960
defeated them once and for all.
And Decca Bolis committed suicide.

893
00:55:49.050 --> 00:55:53.370
Trajan had secured a great victory and it would be the first of many.

894
00:55:53.430 --> 00:55:57.480
Much of his reign was spent expanding Rome's borders and in a sense,

895
00:55:57.540 --> 00:55:59.460
neutralizing hostile threats.

896
00:55:59.670 --> 00:56:04.320
And one 1580 trading would embark on the conquest of Parthenia his victories.

897
00:56:04.320 --> 00:56:04.831
There would,

898
00:56:04.831 --> 00:56:09.180
when Rome control of the territory surrounding the Tigris and Euphrates rivers,

899
00:56:09.240 --> 00:56:12.150
a great accomplishment,
but they would not last.

900
00:56:12.210 --> 00:56:15.840
Trajan died of old age while still expanding into the Middle East.

901
00:56:15.910 --> 00:56:19.740
The Roman people would refer to him as optimum Preen Capes,

902
00:56:19.800 --> 00:56:20.970
the greatest ruler.

903
00:56:21.000 --> 00:56:25.360
He was a strong ruler who came to power in the middle of Pax Romana and brought

904
00:56:25.361 --> 00:56:30.070
the empire [inaudible] and one 17 and the Roman empire.

905
00:56:30.071 --> 00:56:31.810
It was powerful,
glorious,

906
00:56:31.840 --> 00:56:36.840
wealthy and ruling over its greatest territorial extent from Scotland to Egypt

907
00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:38.650
to Crimea,
to Morocco,

908
00:56:38.710 --> 00:56:42.670
the generation of Romans living under trade and would continue to enjoy this

909
00:56:42.671 --> 00:56:44.470
golden age even after his death,

910
00:56:44.530 --> 00:56:48.480
living under the reigns of other great emperors like Hadrian who concerns

911
00:56:48.481 --> 00:56:52.880
himself with building walls and other defenses around Rome and stabilizing Rome

912
00:56:52.881 --> 00:56:57.400
internally and Marcus Aurelius,
the philosopher emperor.
However,

913
00:56:57.460 --> 00:57:02.050
it was not destined to last forever and the one eighties UBC as series of

914
00:57:02.051 --> 00:57:05.320
corrupt leadership will begin to drag the empire down,

915
00:57:05.410 --> 00:57:09.730
putting it in critical condition and beginning a series of events that will

916
00:57:09.731 --> 00:57:14.710
eventually lead to the fall of this mighty empire altogether.
In the next video,

917
00:57:14.860 --> 00:57:18.400
we will pick up with the reign of Hadrian and explore the fate of Rome,

918
00:57:18.640 --> 00:57:22.810
the emperors and events which sickened the empire and the emperors who would try

919
00:57:22.811 --> 00:57:23.644
to save it.

920
00:57:23.650 --> 00:57:27.520
