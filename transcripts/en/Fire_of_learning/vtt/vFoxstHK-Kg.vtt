Hello and welcome to fire of learning.
In the last video,

2
00:00:03.301 --> 00:00:07.770
we covered the history of Ireland from its early beginnings and left off with

3
00:00:07.771 --> 00:00:11.070
the rule of Henry the aids,
which was a crucial time period for Ireland.

4
00:00:11.071 --> 00:00:14.460
As the war of the roses had ended with Henry's father,

5
00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.170
Protestantism started being introduced to Ireland and Henry made himself king of

6
00:00:19.171 --> 00:00:21.690
Ireland rather than just lord of Ireland.

7
00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.720
And then died in 1547 Henry was succeeded by his son who became Edward the sixth

8
00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.770
Edward was a son for whom Henry had wished throughout his reign and the

9
00:00:31.771 --> 00:00:36.690
Protestant air that the English were glad to see.
He lived to succeed his father,

10
00:00:36.691 --> 00:00:39.690
but unfortunately he was sickly throughout his life.

11
00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.410
Edward died in 1553 from an unknown cause,

12
00:00:43.411 --> 00:00:47.250
likely tuberculosis or another disease affecting the lungs.

13
00:00:47.251 --> 00:00:50.220
Though as with most deaths of historical figures,

14
00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.140
some people speculate he was poisoned.

15
00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.000
This created an interesting turn of events for not only England,

16
00:00:57.001 --> 00:00:59.820
but Ireland as well.
During Edwards rain.

17
00:00:59.821 --> 00:01:04.200
He and his administration had begun to feel as though bringing Ireland to

18
00:01:04.201 --> 00:01:06.360
English rule required brute force.

19
00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:11.570
The surrender and regret policy of Henry failed almost immediately as the Gaelic

20
00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:14.220
Laura had agreed to it to get to king off their backs,

21
00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.240
but then went back to really in their own lands in their own way and found the

22
00:01:18.241 --> 00:01:21.240
government in Dublin too weak to do anything about it.

23
00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.470
Though attempts were made to prevent her ascension following the death of
Edward,

24
00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.400
his older sister Mary became queen of England.
Mary,

25
00:01:29.401 --> 00:01:31.500
unlike her father and younger brother,

26
00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.090
was firmly Catholic and would try to drag England from Protestantism back to

27
00:01:36.091 --> 00:01:37.830
Catholicism in England.

28
00:01:37.831 --> 00:01:41.370
Her methods of doing this would earn her the name Bloody Mary,

29
00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.430
but in Ireland the Irish were fairly content with this.

30
00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.630
Catholicism was not disappearing in Ireland and the English had often lack the

31
00:01:48.631 --> 00:01:53.160
power to change that.
The Irish were glad to see Mary on the throne,

32
00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.720
but nevertheless they weren't sure about the future and still felt a stronger

33
00:01:57.721 --> 00:02:00.600
loyalty to their own people and to the pope and the church,

34
00:02:00.601 --> 00:02:04.860
which in their eyes at this time kind of came before the English monarch.

35
00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.710
Perhaps they were justified in doing so.
Mary,

36
00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:12.420
the Catholic was still an English woman and made efforts to control Ireland

37
00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:15.390
largely through the use of plantations.

38
00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:20.160
A tactic which would change the face of Ireland forever plantations were

39
00:02:20.161 --> 00:02:24.360
essentially forms of colonizing Ireland with loyal Englishman.

40
00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:29.070
Queen Mary's main efforts were in the modern day Offley and leash called the

41
00:02:29.071 --> 00:02:32.070
plantation of the Kings County and Queens County.

42
00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:36.300
These areas were specifically chosen to displace rebellious Irishman,

43
00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:37.940
the o'conners and a Morris.

44
00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:42.950
In 1566 the local Irish weren't exactly content with this and pursued warfare

45
00:02:43.681 --> 00:02:44.790
against the English.

46
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.840
Naturally the English had a hard time attracting settlers to such an area.

47
00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:52.590
I'm sure you can imagine that if you were a well off Englishman or Englishwoman,

48
00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:57.540
you wouldn't want to up root in an already unstable time to go live in a war

49
00:02:57.541 --> 00:03:00.100
zone.
And for all and purposes.

50
00:03:00.101 --> 00:03:03.670
These plantations essentially became military fortifications.

51
00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:08.860
In November of 1558 Mary died despite attempts to prevent it.

52
00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:12.340
Her sister Elizabeth was Exceder once again,

53
00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:16.480
England was to change religions as her sister was a protestant and wished to

54
00:03:16.481 --> 00:03:18.160
continue the work of her father.

55
00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:21.910
Securing Ireland was now once more in modern terms,

56
00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:25.390
a matter of national security for the Protestant English,

57
00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:29.320
hoping to prevent the island from allying with the Spanish or French,

58
00:03:29.321 --> 00:03:33.970
and being used as a base from which a Catholic invasion could come justifying

59
00:03:33.971 --> 00:03:37.240
further the very costly efforts to subdue the island.

60
00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:40.810
This fear was not quite so unrealistic and in fact,

61
00:03:40.811 --> 00:03:43.150
in Elizabeth's first years as ruler,

62
00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:46.480
she was faced with this issue and Ulster,

63
00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:50.800
the Earl of Tyrone Shane O'Neill acted increasingly troublesome.

64
00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:54.910
He had taken the rule of Tyrone illegally in the eyes of the English as his

65
00:03:54.911 --> 00:03:57.850
father had declared his first born son,
his successor,

66
00:03:57.851 --> 00:04:00.250
but in accordance with Gaelic Breton law,

67
00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:04.540
Shane took a position for himself and to feed it English attempts to stop him

68
00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:09.430
though an enemy of England and an ally of the Scottish McDonald clan,

69
00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:13.360
which was settling in interim at the time,
who were photos of the English.

70
00:04:13.361 --> 00:04:15.640
Elizabeth was forced to negotiate.

71
00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:21.120
She offered to allow shame to keep his role so long as he accepted English law

72
00:04:21.251 --> 00:04:26.110
and submitted to the Lord Deputy of Ireland,
the Earl of Sussex,
but he refused.

73
00:04:26.111 --> 00:04:31.111
And in 1561 Shane defeated the English again at the battle of red seconds.

74
00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:35.260
Within his reign,
he would become the enemy of other Irish Lords,

75
00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:39.220
the McDonald's of Scotland and the English surrounded by enemies.

76
00:04:39.221 --> 00:04:43.870
He went so far as to invite the French into the fight and even offered to become

77
00:04:43.871 --> 00:04:46.600
a subject of the French king.
Consequently,

78
00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:50.080
he was heavily pursued by the English under Sir Henry Sydney,

79
00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:53.410
but he was beheaded by the antrum Scott's before they could reach them.

80
00:04:53.411 --> 00:04:58.411
In 1567 Shane's head was taken to Dublin where it rested on a pike on the castle

81
00:04:59.021 --> 00:04:59.854
walls.

82
00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:03.700
Elizabeth continued to pursue a military campaign against Ireland and those

83
00:05:03.701 --> 00:05:05.320
Shane O'Neill was defeated.

84
00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:10.090
The own Niels and Ulster in general were and would continue to be a problem for

85
00:05:10.091 --> 00:05:14.890
the English Elizabeth's forces swept through Ireland subduing much of the island

86
00:05:14.891 --> 00:05:18.700
removing moving Catholicism where ever they sought often violently and reforming

87
00:05:18.701 --> 00:05:23.680
the island to be truly English,
not Anglo,
Irish or worse Gaelic Irish.

88
00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:26.680
Yet olster remained the most defined.

89
00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:29.470
Shane successor Turla knock,

90
00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:33.250
gathered together an Irish and Scottish forced to stand against the English

91
00:05:33.251 --> 00:05:35.440
invaders at the same time,

92
00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:38.890
rebellions and conflict and months there were sprouting up in response to

93
00:05:38.891 --> 00:05:41.380
Elizabeth's attempts at plantation there.

94
00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:46.390
These plantation attempts would also be disastrous as the rebellions continued

95
00:05:46.391 --> 00:05:50.230
for decades with the slaughtering of the innocent scorched earth tactics,

96
00:05:50.231 --> 00:05:51.130
guerrilla warfare,

97
00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:55.960
mercilessness against foes and foreign intervention from Spain and the pope by

98
00:05:55.961 --> 00:05:58.940
the 1590s one third of monsters.

99
00:05:58.941 --> 00:06:00.980
Population had died from the conflict,

100
00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:06.010
starvation and sickness in olster conflict came again under a ruler whom the

101
00:06:06.831 --> 00:06:10.040
English had thought to be loyal to the crown hew own Neil.

102
00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:14.930
He O'neil had formed an alliance of Auster chieftains and asked for assistance

103
00:06:14.931 --> 00:06:17.390
from Spain and then moved against England,

104
00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:22.480
sparking an event in April of 1593 which would come to be known as a nine years

105
00:06:22.821 --> 00:06:23.654
of war.

106
00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:27.710
The English brought together an army of 27,000 men to deal with this threat,

107
00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:30.950
the largest forest to invade Ireland.
Up to that point ever,

108
00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:33.260
despite this intimidating force,

109
00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:38.290
the Irish were seeing victory and by 1596 we're receiving supplies and later

110
00:06:39.021 --> 00:06:40.460
soldiers from the Spanish,

111
00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:44.600
the Spanish armada had been defeated by the English a decade earlier and they

112
00:06:44.601 --> 00:06:48.680
were eager to get back at them and deal a blow to them and a two countries

113
00:06:48.681 --> 00:06:49.850
continuous struggle.

114
00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:55.300
Essentially all of Ireland outside the pail wasn't open rebellion and in league

115
00:06:55.401 --> 00:06:56.660
with the Catholic Spanish.

116
00:06:57.290 --> 00:07:01.730
The nine years war was more than just a thorn in the side of England winning.

117
00:07:01.731 --> 00:07:06.731
It was now a matter of securing England itself at the siege of Kinsale from 1601

118
00:07:07.861 --> 00:07:11.180
the 1602 at tides turned on the Irish.

119
00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:14.180
Their defeat at the hands of Charles Blount,

120
00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:17.840
the Earl of mountain joy would cause the Spanish to pull out from their

121
00:07:17.841 --> 00:07:22.841
intervention and the rebellion in Ireland to fade on March 30th,

122
00:07:23.150 --> 00:07:23.561
1603 he will,

123
00:07:23.561 --> 00:07:28.280
Neil surrendered conflict within then slowly start to come to a close in April

124
00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:30.710
though Elizabeth had died a week prior.

125
00:07:30.711 --> 00:07:35.711
On March 24th she had finally achieved what no other English ruler had rural of

126
00:07:36.231 --> 00:07:40.370
the entire island of Ireland.
It came at great costs.
However,

127
00:07:40.730 --> 00:07:44.000
England wasn't debt.
By around 400,000 pounds,

128
00:07:44.030 --> 00:07:47.030
at least a hundred thousand people died in this conflict,

129
00:07:47.031 --> 00:07:51.380
including 30,000 English soldiers,
largely from famine and disease.

130
00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:56.030
Many of the earls left Ireland not long after an event known as the flight of

131
00:07:56.031 --> 00:08:00.260
the Earl's to stay in Catholic Europe and look for military backing to return to

132
00:08:00.261 --> 00:08:04.640
Ireland and reclaim it.
Fun side fact provided my family tree is accurate.

133
00:08:04.641 --> 00:08:07.070
One of my great grandfathers,
Richard Boyle,

134
00:08:07.220 --> 00:08:09.050
was actually involved in these events.

135
00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:13.280
Eventually becoming the Earl of Cork and the father of Robert Boyle,

136
00:08:13.281 --> 00:08:14.570
making him my great uncle.

137
00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:16.910
After having worked with Queen Elizabeth and all of that,

138
00:08:16.940 --> 00:08:18.320
he comes into the Labia.

139
00:08:18.321 --> 00:08:22.220
Let Line my last name through my paternal grandfather's great grandmother.

140
00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:25.730
Not that I'd take England site in this.
I really take sides on this channel.

141
00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:29.150
Just thought,
uh,
you know,
throw that in there.
Anyway,

142
00:08:29.151 --> 00:08:32.810
now we can go around the class and you all can tell me a fun fact about
yourself.

143
00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:39.440
Elizabeth was succeeded by her cousin James,

144
00:08:39.441 --> 00:08:43.820
who is James the first of England and Ireland and James is sixth of Scotland.

145
00:08:43.910 --> 00:08:47.660
Scotland was held in a personal union,
was England and Ireland,

146
00:08:47.690 --> 00:08:51.290
but existed as its own country with its own laws.
Nevertheless,

147
00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:55.920
the three countries along with of course Wales,
which was at this under England,

148
00:08:55.950 --> 00:08:59.100
but not to be forgotten,
we're all United under one monarch.

149
00:08:59.101 --> 00:09:00.720
For the first time in history,

150
00:09:00.870 --> 00:09:04.230
James would continue much of the work of his tutor,
predecessors,

151
00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:07.830
namely plantations and spreading Protestantism in Ireland.

152
00:09:08.010 --> 00:09:09.090
Throughout his kingdom.

153
00:09:09.210 --> 00:09:13.500
Catholic priests were banished and the tendance at Protestant religious services

154
00:09:13.530 --> 00:09:18.300
were compulsory.
Though as usual,
these laws had much less effect in Ireland,

155
00:09:18.301 --> 00:09:21.000
which still remained Catholic.
Admittedly,
however,

156
00:09:21.001 --> 00:09:25.050
James lightened up on Irish Catholics more than his predecessors avoiding

157
00:09:25.051 --> 00:09:27.060
potential conflict.
James,

158
00:09:27.061 --> 00:09:31.080
his lasting legacy in Ireland would be continuing the plantations most

159
00:09:31.081 --> 00:09:34.740
significantly in Ulster.
As we've discussed,

160
00:09:34.741 --> 00:09:39.300
attempts at plantation and Ireland prior to this were a significant failures.

161
00:09:39.750 --> 00:09:43.380
This time James focused on olster the land,

162
00:09:43.381 --> 00:09:48.090
which was historically difficult for the English or control and an area where

163
00:09:48.091 --> 00:09:52.410
the government had an opportunity to seize land with less commotion.

164
00:09:52.530 --> 00:09:56.940
As much of the land was owned by the rebellious earls who had left and the

165
00:09:56.941 --> 00:10:01.941
flight of the Earl's by 1610 after Len and population surveys were undertaken

166
00:10:02.641 --> 00:10:07.260
and maps were created,
the process of plantation had begun,

167
00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:11.820
many who were given land where the servitors soldiers who had served the queen

168
00:10:11.821 --> 00:10:16.080
loyally during the nine years war and men who could for the more defend the

169
00:10:16.081 --> 00:10:20.730
territory if need be.
Many others came from England and especially Scotland,

170
00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:23.910
where Presbyterian Scots became the Ulster Scotts.

171
00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:28.290
There was naturally great emphasis on these settlers being Protestant.

172
00:10:28.620 --> 00:10:31.500
If they were Catholics,
it would defeat the purpose after all,

173
00:10:31.590 --> 00:10:34.560
however many native Irish regretted lands as well.

174
00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:38.520
In exchange for loyalty to the crown,
though their taxes were higher.

175
00:10:38.730 --> 00:10:42.570
The process of plantation and Ulster continued with John's successor,

176
00:10:42.571 --> 00:10:47.571
Charles the first and by 1641 the population of planter is in Ireland,

177
00:10:47.671 --> 00:10:52.320
reached about a hundred thousand which was one 10th of Ireland's population at

178
00:10:52.321 --> 00:10:55.800
the time.
A huge wave of people in a short time,

179
00:10:55.890 --> 00:10:58.020
but regardless and the rest of Ireland,

180
00:10:58.140 --> 00:11:01.290
Catholic Irish still controlled three fourths of the country.

181
00:11:01.530 --> 00:11:05.820
Families such as the Johnston's,
Graham's Armstrong's Montgomery's,

182
00:11:05.821 --> 00:11:10.020
Hamilton's Gibbons,
et cetera.
We're active in this plantation.
Naturally,

183
00:11:10.021 --> 00:11:14.430
the English replacing emphasis on their loyal and Protestant planters over the

184
00:11:14.431 --> 00:11:18.930
Anglo Irish nor refer to as the old English,
the descendants of the Normans,

185
00:11:18.931 --> 00:11:19.764
if you recall,

186
00:11:19.950 --> 00:11:24.450
and of course the Gaelic Irish James had held things together fairly well,

187
00:11:24.451 --> 00:11:29.451
but Charles the first was a lot less successful of a monarch in many ways as we

188
00:11:29.671 --> 00:11:34.230
will see and upset the Irish,
the old English,
and even the planters.

189
00:11:34.350 --> 00:11:37.230
Furthermore,
he was not alone in this.
His Lord Deputy of Ireland,

190
00:11:37.231 --> 00:11:39.390
Thomas Wentworth,
the Earl of Strafford,

191
00:11:39.391 --> 00:11:44.340
played a big role to Charles had major enemies in England and Scotland as well.

192
00:11:44.430 --> 00:11:48.330
Early on in his reign,
he became involved in the 30 years war,

193
00:11:48.570 --> 00:11:52.860
a conflict in Europe to find by religious differences,
but also political.

194
00:11:53.770 --> 00:11:54.880
Throughout his reign,

195
00:11:54.940 --> 00:11:59.410
Charles would lose the support of parliament and be in constant conflict with

196
00:11:59.411 --> 00:12:01.690
them,
never truly seeing eye to eye.

197
00:12:01.750 --> 00:12:06.280
When Charles had attended a force Anglican religious practices on the

198
00:12:06.281 --> 00:12:09.820
Presbyterian Scottish,
it led to the bishop's war.

199
00:12:09.970 --> 00:12:12.010
When the covenant of Scotland rebelled,

200
00:12:12.460 --> 00:12:16.810
parliament refuse to give Charles to funds to fight his fellow Protestants and

201
00:12:16.811 --> 00:12:21.040
things began to truly start heating up and bring the bishop's war would be the

202
00:12:21.041 --> 00:12:23.170
prelude to the English civil war,

203
00:12:23.470 --> 00:12:28.090
which was a conflict belonging to a much larger series of complex known as the

204
00:12:28.091 --> 00:12:29.920
wars of the three kingdoms.

205
00:12:30.010 --> 00:12:34.000
England was about to spend the rest of the century with the power and England

206
00:12:34.001 --> 00:12:36.400
being bounced around various factions.

207
00:12:36.401 --> 00:12:40.150
And as with other incidents in English history,
like the war of the roses,

208
00:12:40.510 --> 00:12:44.920
this was going to affect Ireland's significantly as well.
In Ireland,

209
00:12:44.950 --> 00:12:49.510
the government in Dublin felt much the same way as the parliament of England and

210
00:12:49.511 --> 00:12:53.170
when the Lord Deputy of Ireland was raising an army to assist Charles,

211
00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:57.280
they executed him.
People in England began to choose sides in a civil war,

212
00:12:57.281 --> 00:13:01.420
which was now inevitable.
Those loyal to the King English Catholics,

213
00:13:01.421 --> 00:13:05.320
the nobility and the Welsh in Cornish came together as the royalist.

214
00:13:05.321 --> 00:13:07.060
Under Charles,
the Protestants,

215
00:13:07.090 --> 00:13:11.770
Scottish and common folk tended to support the parliamentarians on rather

216
00:13:11.771 --> 00:13:15.730
rebellious parliament.
In Ireland,
a similar divide was taking shape,

217
00:13:16.120 --> 00:13:20.530
the olster planters and the government and the Pale lean towards supporting the

218
00:13:20.531 --> 00:13:21.520
parliamentarians.

219
00:13:21.550 --> 00:13:25.600
Whereas the Irish Catholics who saw Charles as a more lenient king,

220
00:13:25.601 --> 00:13:30.160
especially compared to the more devout the Protestant parliamentarians and

221
00:13:30.161 --> 00:13:34.870
hostile Protestant Scottish,
we threatened them,
saw Charles as the better option.

222
00:13:35.170 --> 00:13:38.440
Both sides were ultimately motivated by fear.

223
00:13:38.920 --> 00:13:40.660
The Irish feared a stark,

224
00:13:40.661 --> 00:13:44.530
the Protestant government who would wage war on their beliefs and their country,

225
00:13:44.890 --> 00:13:48.520
the English and Scottish fear to king who ruled without parliament.

226
00:13:48.640 --> 00:13:53.080
And could even restore Catholicism,
the nation with the help of an Irish army.

227
00:13:53.290 --> 00:13:55.750
This fear will become brutal.
Anger.

228
00:13:55.960 --> 00:14:00.960
Rebellion in Ireland erupted in October of 1641 Catholic Irish gentry such as

229
00:14:01.751 --> 00:14:06.340
feel I'm O'neil Rory,
or more Donald McCarthy and Connor McGuire.

230
00:14:06.341 --> 00:14:10.810
Plan too surprising leash and take Dublin Castle and parts of Ulster,

231
00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:14.230
and then issued a man's for the rights of Catholics to be recognized.

232
00:14:14.290 --> 00:14:18.040
They intended to do this with little bloodshed and figured that when they

233
00:14:18.041 --> 00:14:22.810
control these areas,
the Irish Catholic majority was support them on.

234
00:14:22.811 --> 00:14:24.970
Fortunately for them,
a Protestant spy,

235
00:14:25.030 --> 00:14:29.380
oh and O'Connelly discover the plot and the element of surprise was gone.

236
00:14:29.530 --> 00:14:33.490
Dublin castle was not taken,
but areas of Ulster were captured.

237
00:14:33.700 --> 00:14:36.340
They claim to be acting in the name of the king,

238
00:14:36.370 --> 00:14:38.740
but this was almost certainly not the case.

239
00:14:38.741 --> 00:14:41.440
And his suppose it instructions were forgeries,

240
00:14:41.800 --> 00:14:45.820
but it helps give the parliamentarians the incentive to move against the king.

241
00:14:45.821 --> 00:14:50.200
Anyway,
the English reacted by sending an army into Ireland,
fearing the worst.

242
00:14:50.530 --> 00:14:54.830
The brutality of these soldiers only exacerbated things and caused more of the

243
00:14:54.831 --> 00:14:58.940
Irish to rise up in rebellion.
And as the country's situation flamed,

244
00:14:58.941 --> 00:15:03.770
things became bloodier and Ulster a metaphor,
harvest and economic decline.

245
00:15:03.810 --> 00:15:06.740
The local peasants rose up in anger and fear against the olds.

246
00:15:06.750 --> 00:15:09.590
There's settlers killing many innocent families.

247
00:15:10.040 --> 00:15:12.500
The leaders of the rebellion tried to stop them,

248
00:15:12.501 --> 00:15:17.090
but they were unable to prevent a swarm of peasants that they had inadvertently

249
00:15:17.091 --> 00:15:18.620
unleashed.
Estimates.

250
00:15:18.621 --> 00:15:23.450
Put the total number of all sir planters at 4,000 killed with around 10 to

251
00:15:23.451 --> 00:15:26.720
12,000 more killed by related famine and disease.

252
00:15:27.170 --> 00:15:32.170
The English for propaganda reasons slightly exaggerated this number to 200,000

253
00:15:33.590 --> 00:15:38.390
imagine taking something like the nine 11 attacks and reporting instead that the

254
00:15:38.391 --> 00:15:43.391
entire state of New York was a vaporized by nuclear weapons based on a wheel

255
00:15:43.701 --> 00:15:44.150
incident,

256
00:15:44.150 --> 00:15:48.500
but exaggerate it to an extreme degree is uncertain whether or not there were

257
00:15:48.501 --> 00:15:53.210
even 200,000 officer planters in total.
But this goes to show a,

258
00:15:53.300 --> 00:15:58.070
how crucial the English felt getting the population on their side was and B,

259
00:15:58.340 --> 00:16:02.510
how little people really knew because of how poorly information traveled in the

260
00:16:02.511 --> 00:16:06.110
17th century makes it really appreciate this whole Internet thing.

261
00:16:06.530 --> 00:16:10.640
Charles sent forces to Ireland who were purportedly there to put down the

262
00:16:10.641 --> 00:16:11.151
rebellion,

263
00:16:11.151 --> 00:16:16.151
but in truth ended up working with the Irish rebels in 1642 the English civil

264
00:16:16.311 --> 00:16:17.600
war had truly begun.

265
00:16:17.870 --> 00:16:21.290
As the parliamentarian is declared their intention to punish all Catholics for

266
00:16:21.291 --> 00:16:25.160
the rebellion of the prior year.
Nearly all Ireland rose up in revolt.

267
00:16:25.370 --> 00:16:27.200
Later that year.
In May,

268
00:16:27.230 --> 00:16:31.790
the Irish gentry met at Kilkenny and established central leadership under the

269
00:16:31.791 --> 00:16:36.140
Confederation of Ireland.
This was not really an independence movement,

270
00:16:36.170 --> 00:16:40.850
but it was absolutely a movement against the English to force them to recognize

271
00:16:40.851 --> 00:16:42.050
the rights of Catholics.

272
00:16:42.230 --> 00:16:45.440
The pope sent an envoy partially in support of the rebellion,

273
00:16:45.441 --> 00:16:50.441
but also to ensure a focus on Catholicism not merely lend or political rights.

274
00:16:50.630 --> 00:16:55.250
By 1649 the English and Scottish and captured King Charles and beheaded him,

275
00:16:55.400 --> 00:16:59.840
the English civil war had for now and one with a parliamentarian victory.

276
00:16:59.960 --> 00:17:04.520
And England came one of the rule of their new government with a man named Oliver

277
00:17:04.520 --> 00:17:06.740
Cromwell and control of the new model army,

278
00:17:07.250 --> 00:17:12.250
one of the most powerful armed forces in the world at a time with England secure

279
00:17:12.290 --> 00:17:16.640
chrom wellness plan to move into Ireland where he would become one of the most

280
00:17:16.641 --> 00:17:18.740
hated figures in Irish history.

281
00:17:18.980 --> 00:17:21.680
He arrived in Ireland in August of that year,

282
00:17:21.770 --> 00:17:26.270
focusing on taking and securing olster and the major cities.
By winter,

283
00:17:26.330 --> 00:17:28.190
much of the island was under his rule.

284
00:17:28.280 --> 00:17:33.280
By 1652 Ireland had been subdued Cromwell sought not only to subjugate the

285
00:17:34.071 --> 00:17:36.470
Irish,
but eradicate Catholicism.

286
00:17:36.590 --> 00:17:41.590
During the period of 1641 1652 Ireland's population was cut almost in half by

287
00:17:44.121 --> 00:17:45.500
disease,
famine,

288
00:17:45.501 --> 00:17:50.340
and brutal unrestrained killing and the majority of the dead were Catholics.

289
00:17:50.490 --> 00:17:55.200
Soldiers and civilians alike were killed and enslaved and shipped off to work

290
00:17:55.201 --> 00:17:56.034
and the Caribbean,

291
00:17:56.130 --> 00:18:00.360
including Catholic priests who were specific target as there were often bounties

292
00:18:00.361 --> 00:18:03.720
placed on them.
Many were clubbed to death to save bullets.

293
00:18:03.960 --> 00:18:06.750
Some were lucky and fled to Spain or France.

294
00:18:06.930 --> 00:18:09.810
Cranwell began confiscating land from the Irish betting.

295
00:18:09.811 --> 00:18:13.170
Many of the former rebellious cath land owners to,
as I said,

296
00:18:13.230 --> 00:18:17.160
the Caribbean as slaves or to desolate regions and Conoco.

297
00:18:17.220 --> 00:18:21.240
The land was then returned to Protestant lords and soldiers who are owed wages.

298
00:18:21.450 --> 00:18:21.990
Thus,

299
00:18:21.990 --> 00:18:26.920
the land was ruled in the majority by Protestants about 10,000 Protestant

300
00:18:26.921 --> 00:18:31.260
settled throughout Ireland and lands given to them as payment for the services.

301
00:18:31.350 --> 00:18:36.090
Soldiers were required to keep their weapons and serve as a militia in England.

302
00:18:36.120 --> 00:18:39.600
Cromwell was essentially acting as a king and all but name,

303
00:18:40.080 --> 00:18:45.080
but he did not live to rule for long dying and 1658 England would return to the

304
00:18:46.081 --> 00:18:51.000
rural of a monarchy as Charles a second.
Charles at first son claim the throne.

305
00:18:51.360 --> 00:18:55.230
Charles a second would make the wise move of pardoning many of those who had

306
00:18:55.231 --> 00:18:57.630
acted against his father,
including in Ireland,

307
00:18:57.780 --> 00:19:02.100
but he would not allow all the changes to remain.
He moved to return land.

308
00:19:02.130 --> 00:19:06.300
We small percentage of the Catholic population in Ireland who could prove that

309
00:19:06.301 --> 00:19:07.920
they were not a part of the rebellion.

310
00:19:07.980 --> 00:19:11.820
It was not a huge increase going from only about 10 to now,

311
00:19:11.821 --> 00:19:16.260
20% of the land being owned by Catholics,
but it's slightly ease,

312
00:19:16.261 --> 00:19:21.261
the still very strong tensions and a grave times Arland was facing the tables

313
00:19:21.841 --> 00:19:26.340
flipped yet again in England as Charles is second names a catholic heir to the

314
00:19:26.341 --> 00:19:30.960
throne who would become James is second in 1685 this,

315
00:19:30.961 --> 00:19:32.010
as you might expect,

316
00:19:32.011 --> 00:19:36.060
caused a great deal of commotion and England having a Catholic monarch

317
00:19:36.061 --> 00:19:40.800
threatened Protestants in England and their hold and Ireland especially as James

318
00:19:40.801 --> 00:19:43.290
had named a Catholic Lord Deputy of Ireland.

319
00:19:43.590 --> 00:19:46.950
The commotion settled down when he named his daughter Mary,

320
00:19:46.980 --> 00:19:50.820
who was married to William of Orange Dot holder the Netherlands is air,

321
00:19:51.210 --> 00:19:52.950
both of whom are Protestant.

322
00:19:53.280 --> 00:19:58.200
The English breathed a sigh of relief and then he changed his mind.

323
00:19:58.350 --> 00:20:02.220
He named his Catholic son to be his there and parliament rose up against them.

324
00:20:02.230 --> 00:20:04.110
The challenge,
the monarchy,
once again,

325
00:20:04.530 --> 00:20:07.560
in an event known as the Glorious Revolution,

326
00:20:07.740 --> 00:20:10.860
William was made king along with his co monarch wife,

327
00:20:10.920 --> 00:20:15.180
Mary James Flood to Ireland,
where he knew the Catholic population,

328
00:20:15.210 --> 00:20:19.020
what support him in Ireland.
This led to the William might wars,

329
00:20:19.110 --> 00:20:21.510
which was both a war for the throne of England,

330
00:20:21.540 --> 00:20:26.370
but also an Irish attempt at rebellion and revenge against the Protestant elite

331
00:20:26.640 --> 00:20:31.620
with a Catholic English king making a grab for the throne.
This was their chance,

332
00:20:32.010 --> 00:20:34.200
James,
with backing from King Louis,

333
00:20:34.201 --> 00:20:37.920
the 14th of France attempted to secure control of Ireland,

334
00:20:38.010 --> 00:20:43.010
but by 1691 limerick had been taken and he recognized his defeat was inevitable.

335
00:20:44.190 --> 00:20:49.180
He abandoned his forces fleeing France,
earning him.
The name Shamus on Haka,

336
00:20:49.240 --> 00:20:53.680
Shamus being the Irish equivalent word for James Schamus,
James,
Sean,
John,

337
00:20:53.720 --> 00:20:57.730
etc. And on a Haka being a title that you don't really want as a ruler,

338
00:20:57.790 --> 00:20:59.920
the prewar order returned.

339
00:21:00.310 --> 00:21:03.160
The Protestant elite assumed command of Ireland.

340
00:21:03.460 --> 00:21:05.860
Catholics were borrowed from a number of physicians.

341
00:21:06.160 --> 00:21:10.810
Observance of Catholicism was banned and the large number of rebels were

342
00:21:10.811 --> 00:21:15.400
deported.
The friends in an event known as the flight of the wild geese.

343
00:21:15.550 --> 00:21:20.550
It is from this time that the Protestant Irish associate themselves with the

344
00:21:21.130 --> 00:21:23.710
Color Orange and association,
which lasts to this day,

345
00:21:23.830 --> 00:21:27.790
and the victory of this war is still celebrated by the Protestant Irish as well.

346
00:21:27.970 --> 00:21:30.910
The Protestants crackdown on Irish Catholics again,

347
00:21:31.030 --> 00:21:34.000
who had been troublesome throughout the 17th century.

348
00:21:34.240 --> 00:21:38.020
The distinction between a Gaelic Irish and the Norman Irish disappeared.

349
00:21:38.230 --> 00:21:41.560
Old penal laws were reintroduced alongside new ones.

350
00:21:41.770 --> 00:21:44.500
Catholic land ownership fell significantly.

351
00:21:44.560 --> 00:21:48.940
Catholics could not vote or hold public office.
They could not run schools.

352
00:21:48.970 --> 00:21:53.170
They could not enter legal professions and they could not bear arms or hold

353
00:21:53.171 --> 00:21:57.610
higher ranks in the army.
However,
it was not illegal,
per se to be a catholic.

354
00:21:57.730 --> 00:21:58.810
The English at this point,

355
00:21:58.811 --> 00:22:03.010
we're more concerned with controlling the Catholics rather than converting

356
00:22:03.011 --> 00:22:07.840
droves of them,
and the Catholicism was heavily regulated and looked down upon,

357
00:22:08.230 --> 00:22:11.410
but not exactly illegal.
Nevertheless,

358
00:22:11.440 --> 00:22:15.700
Catholicism held on strongly in Ireland.
At the start of the 18th century,

359
00:22:15.730 --> 00:22:20.730
75% of the country was still Catholic being ruled by less than the top 25% as

360
00:22:21.491 --> 00:22:22.880
now Presbyterian officer.

361
00:22:22.881 --> 00:22:26.020
Scots weren't on the same level as Anglican Irish either.

362
00:22:26.230 --> 00:22:31.230
The English still how remake conversion and enticing and easy option publicly

363
00:22:31.721 --> 00:22:36.250
denounced Catholicism convert to the Protestant faith and your rights were

364
00:22:36.251 --> 00:22:39.520
returned.
Some went along with this,
nine did not.

365
00:22:40.240 --> 00:22:44.590
In 1707 under Queen Anne,
the successor of the joint monarchs,

366
00:22:44.591 --> 00:22:46.990
King William,
the third and married a second.

367
00:22:47.350 --> 00:22:52.300
The acts of union merged the kingdoms of England and Scotland into the United

368
00:22:52.300 --> 00:22:56.470
Kingdom of Great Britain.
Ireland was no longer just a possession of England.

369
00:22:56.680 --> 00:22:59.020
It was now a part of the British empire,

370
00:22:59.290 --> 00:23:03.700
which would spend the next two centuries becoming the largest empire in world

371
00:23:03.701 --> 00:23:04.534
history

372
00:23:07.210 --> 00:23:11.800
compared to the 17th century when blood was spilled across the whole island of

373
00:23:11.801 --> 00:23:15.310
Ireland and rebellions,
religious conflicts and civil wars.

374
00:23:15.490 --> 00:23:19.720
The early half of the 18th century was a less violent time for Ireland,

375
00:23:19.810 --> 00:23:23.410
sometimes referred to as the long peace love.
Of course.

376
00:23:23.440 --> 00:23:27.010
That is not to say that the Irish,
namely the Catholic majority,

377
00:23:27.220 --> 00:23:31.480
we're content with things or that it was a prosperous age for the country.

378
00:23:31.900 --> 00:23:34.870
There was considerable economic,
technological,

379
00:23:34.871 --> 00:23:38.200
social and architectural development in this time period.

380
00:23:38.620 --> 00:23:41.230
Famous figures like Jonathan Swift of Dublin,

381
00:23:41.260 --> 00:23:45.740
known for his work such as Gulliver's travels and Edmund Burke.
I'm Dublin,

382
00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:49.130
a statesman and philosopher.
We're born this time though,

383
00:23:49.131 --> 00:23:51.410
as you might expect from what we've covered so far.

384
00:23:51.500 --> 00:23:55.790
Much of this progress and enlightenment was unique to the cities and the

385
00:23:55.791 --> 00:23:56.624
plantations.

386
00:23:56.750 --> 00:24:01.580
Ireland outside of his land was a rural place dependent on subsistence farming.

387
00:24:01.730 --> 00:24:05.570
Many of the landowners were English men who weren't frequent residents have

388
00:24:05.571 --> 00:24:09.050
their own land.
In Ireland,
though firmly under English,
Protestant,

389
00:24:09.051 --> 00:24:14.000
Rural Ireland was very much also a place where two distinct cultures existed

390
00:24:14.001 --> 00:24:15.140
parallel to each other.

391
00:24:15.230 --> 00:24:19.940
In 1740 a devastating famine had Ireland caused by extreme,

392
00:24:19.941 --> 00:24:21.140
unusual cold.

393
00:24:21.350 --> 00:24:26.350
Around 400,000 people would die that winter and another 150,000 would emigrate

394
00:24:27.411 --> 00:24:28.550
to brings colonies.

395
00:24:28.880 --> 00:24:32.840
The situation was exacerbated by a serious drought the following spring.

396
00:24:33.020 --> 00:24:36.260
Many of those afflicted worthy,
impoverished city dwellers.

397
00:24:36.500 --> 00:24:41.500
The 400,000 dead and the 150,000 who would leave equaled about 30% of Arlene's

398
00:24:41.991 --> 00:24:45.590
population.
At the time,
Ireland had retained its religion,

399
00:24:45.680 --> 00:24:50.600
but it was now in a 1750s beginning to lose another feature of its identity,

400
00:24:50.750 --> 00:24:51.590
its language.

401
00:24:51.860 --> 00:24:56.270
It was in the 18th century that bilingualism became more and more important to

402
00:24:56.271 --> 00:25:00.380
the Irish people as knowing English allowed them to interact with the more

403
00:25:00.381 --> 00:25:02.180
prosperous English society.

404
00:25:02.240 --> 00:25:06.620
The decline of the Irish language truly took off in the 19th century as many

405
00:25:06.621 --> 00:25:10.730
Irish would leave for other parts of the British empire or its successor states

406
00:25:10.760 --> 00:25:13.460
like the u s and Canada who spoke English,

407
00:25:13.640 --> 00:25:18.640
English for become so common that today many outside Ireland and the United

408
00:25:18.740 --> 00:25:23.300
Kingdom are often not aware that a separate language apart from English exists

409
00:25:23.301 --> 00:25:23.960
in Ireland.

410
00:25:23.960 --> 00:25:28.460
I can personally say that this is the case in the United States where many

411
00:25:28.461 --> 00:25:32.690
people are surprised to learn that the Irish have their own language,
but indeed,

412
00:25:32.720 --> 00:25:37.040
until the 19th century Irish was the majority language of the country.

413
00:25:37.340 --> 00:25:41.810
Irish is a Celtic language distinct from dramatic languages like English and

414
00:25:41.811 --> 00:25:45.290
German and the romance languages like French,
Spanish,
and Italian.

415
00:25:45.470 --> 00:25:49.040
It is not left many marks on English despite its proximity.

416
00:25:49.100 --> 00:25:53.270
The many names like Sean Shamus,
Coleen,
which comes from Colleen,

417
00:25:53.360 --> 00:25:54.830
the word for girl,
Brian,

418
00:25:54.831 --> 00:25:59.690
popular from of course Brian Burrow and Brendan main prints are popular these

419
00:25:59.690 --> 00:25:59.960
days.

420
00:25:59.960 --> 00:26:04.640
These spelling and pronunciation are very foreign to English speakers as well as

421
00:26:04.641 --> 00:26:08.240
the structure of the language itself.
The phrase on will,
a gala,

422
00:26:08.241 --> 00:26:13.130
Goget meaning do you speak Irish is technically literally translated.

423
00:26:13.250 --> 00:26:14.810
Is There Irish at you?

424
00:26:15.080 --> 00:26:18.410
There is also no exact word for yes or no.

425
00:26:18.470 --> 00:26:22.940
A feature shared with other languages like Latin finish and other closely

426
00:26:22.941 --> 00:26:25.520
related languages like Scottish Gaelic and Menkes.

427
00:26:25.700 --> 00:26:29.060
People respond with the affirmative or negative of the verb,

428
00:26:30.020 --> 00:26:31.910
the political atmosphere of our limb.
Again,

429
00:26:31.911 --> 00:26:36.440
the change in the sixties and seventies a major cause of such change was the

430
00:26:36.441 --> 00:26:38.210
American war of independence.

431
00:26:38.690 --> 00:26:43.590
The British desperate for troops lifted many bands on Irish Catholic in the

432
00:26:43.591 --> 00:26:47.670
military,
in shipped many Irishmen to fight on the side of Britain and the war.

433
00:26:47.790 --> 00:26:49.710
Many Irish Protestants,
however,

434
00:26:49.920 --> 00:26:53.850
actually favored the American side of the war as they felt as well that they

435
00:26:53.851 --> 00:26:58.350
should be governing Arland on their own with less interference from London on

436
00:26:58.351 --> 00:26:59.400
the colonial side.

437
00:26:59.430 --> 00:27:04.430
Many olster Scots Irish had immigrated to America and played an important role

438
00:27:04.501 --> 00:27:09.270
in the war of independence during this time to secure a Catholic loyalties to

439
00:27:09.271 --> 00:27:13.080
crown the English.
Granted Len owning Catholics the right to vote.

440
00:27:13.440 --> 00:27:18.440
By 1783 many Irishmen took part in a successful rebellion against England,

441
00:27:19.650 --> 00:27:23.190
though on another continent during the American war of independence,

442
00:27:23.191 --> 00:27:26.970
the Irish parliament in a period of its history known as Gretchen's parliament.

443
00:27:27.030 --> 00:27:32.030
After the very vocal Henry gratin began making similar requests from the British

444
00:27:32.041 --> 00:27:32.874
government.

445
00:27:32.880 --> 00:27:37.880
The Irish were less revolutionary and didn't seek to cut ties with Britain as

446
00:27:38.101 --> 00:27:40.140
America eventually decided to do,

447
00:27:40.290 --> 00:27:44.040
but the British weren't prepared to handle yet another conflict.

448
00:27:44.430 --> 00:27:49.230
Say what you will about how the American Revolution was handled when it came to

449
00:27:49.231 --> 00:27:52.860
Ireland.
The British showed the world that they had learned their lesson.

450
00:27:53.250 --> 00:27:57.780
In 1782 the British allowed the Irish parliament more self rule over their

451
00:27:57.781 --> 00:28:00.660
country.
This was hardly a real concession.

452
00:28:00.661 --> 00:28:03.810
Though the control of Ireland still remained in London.

453
00:28:04.470 --> 00:28:08.790
These concessions would not halt feelings of nationalism and new political

454
00:28:08.791 --> 00:28:11.550
thinking,
which had been spreading across the western world.

455
00:28:11.760 --> 00:28:16.760
In 1789 the French people revolted against their monarchy over throwing it and

456
00:28:16.951 --> 00:28:19.290
declaring their nation to be a republic.

457
00:28:19.380 --> 00:28:22.080
This movement would greatly inspire the Irish,

458
00:28:22.140 --> 00:28:26.010
especially as they had seen that decade that their parliament was almost as an

459
00:28:26.011 --> 00:28:30.540
effective as ever.
In 1791 in Belfast,
Northern Ireland,

460
00:28:30.630 --> 00:28:35.630
a group of Protestants formed the Society of the United Irishmen led by a 28

461
00:28:36.331 --> 00:28:38.730
year old man named Thea Wolfe tone.

462
00:28:38.910 --> 00:28:42.930
The United Irishmen took a unique perspective to the concept of Irish

463
00:28:42.931 --> 00:28:45.570
independence,
largely inspired by the French.

464
00:28:45.690 --> 00:28:50.430
One of the main new ideas was an alliance between Protestant and Catholic,

465
00:28:50.640 --> 00:28:55.530
a union of mutual Irishness and disdain of the crown in which Irish Catholic and

466
00:28:55.531 --> 00:29:00.030
Protestant work together in one nation to achieve independence.

467
00:29:00.240 --> 00:29:03.300
Wolfe tone began seeking allies at home and abroad.

468
00:29:03.570 --> 00:29:08.310
He would form an alliance with a group of Catholic Middleclass Irishman known as

469
00:29:08.311 --> 00:29:10.800
it offenders,
led by Matthew Murdoch.

470
00:29:12.710 --> 00:29:16.010
Actually Murdoch has a different group of defenders,

471
00:29:16.220 --> 00:29:17.400
although he is Irish Catholic,

472
00:29:17.401 --> 00:29:21.170
so I was on the right track more threateningly the Irish sought the aid of the

473
00:29:21.171 --> 00:29:25.280
French Wolfe tone traveled to France to meet with the revolutionary government.

474
00:29:25.400 --> 00:29:27.260
When Wolfe tone met with this government,

475
00:29:27.261 --> 00:29:30.320
he painted a slightly inaccurate picture of his nation.

476
00:29:30.470 --> 00:29:34.910
He told them that all of Ireland favorite France and was ready to rise up and

477
00:29:34.911 --> 00:29:36.230
unified revolution.

478
00:29:36.530 --> 00:29:41.410
The reality was that Ireland was heavily divided religiously and politically and

479
00:29:41.411 --> 00:29:44.980
they suppose it unified revolution was not guaranteed.

480
00:29:45.040 --> 00:29:49.440
It would have to overcome this obstacle even if the society of United Irishmen

481
00:29:49.441 --> 00:29:50.140
and wanted it.

482
00:29:50.140 --> 00:29:55.140
The French agree to support him and in 1796 of force of 15,000 soldiers but sent

483
00:29:56.471 --> 00:29:59.030
to Ireland under General Azhar Hoish,

484
00:29:59.290 --> 00:30:04.270
this force alone outnumbered the British presence on Ireland and combined with

485
00:30:04.271 --> 00:30:09.271
the Irish forces had an alarming potential to drive Britain out of Ireland.

486
00:30:09.520 --> 00:30:13.450
It could have even set the stage for a French invasion of Britain and from
there,

487
00:30:13.451 --> 00:30:16.060
no one knows what could have happened and we never will.

488
00:30:16.061 --> 00:30:18.910
As the expedition failed bad December,

489
00:30:18.911 --> 00:30:23.590
weather had prevented the French from lending and Wolfe tone devastated said

490
00:30:23.591 --> 00:30:27.160
that the British had had their greatest luck since the Spanish armada.

491
00:30:27.400 --> 00:30:31.030
When the British responded to the incident,
they cracked down on the Irish.

492
00:30:31.031 --> 00:30:34.990
Hard houses were burned,
people were captured,
killed and tortured.

493
00:30:34.991 --> 00:30:39.991
Intention began to build further rebellion began in May of 1798 in June,

494
00:30:41.290 --> 00:30:44.470
much of Northern Ireland rose up and took control of much of the area,

495
00:30:44.500 --> 00:30:48.130
but the forces there were overwhelmed by British and loyalists.
Forces.

496
00:30:48.490 --> 00:30:50.800
Atrocities were committed on both sides.

497
00:30:50.890 --> 00:30:54.550
Rape and murder of civilians was common among the British and loyalist army,

498
00:30:54.760 --> 00:30:57.010
but the rebels committed their fair share of murder.

499
00:30:57.011 --> 00:31:01.060
Two in one incident locking a number of Protestant civilians and a barn and

500
00:31:01.061 --> 00:31:05.710
lighting it on fire.
On August 22nd French troops finally arrived,

501
00:31:05.740 --> 00:31:08.740
but it was a much smaller force of around a thousand men.

502
00:31:08.860 --> 00:31:12.820
This would not be enough to break the British offensive.
And by October,

503
00:31:12.940 --> 00:31:16.380
the rebellion was defeated and Wolfe tone was captured while the board

504
00:31:16.400 --> 00:31:20.410
friendship rather than face public hanging,
he cut his own throat.

505
00:31:21.370 --> 00:31:26.290
These incidents beginning with calls for a form to outright bloody rebellion

506
00:31:26.590 --> 00:31:30.310
would lead the Irish in the opposite direction of what they were trying to

507
00:31:30.311 --> 00:31:31.144
attain.

508
00:31:31.570 --> 00:31:36.340
The British having struggled with Ireland for over 500 years up to this point

509
00:31:36.370 --> 00:31:39.730
now tried to bring about a final solution to Ireland.

510
00:31:40.150 --> 00:31:43.750
The Irish would lose much of their voice all together in a force.

511
00:31:43.751 --> 00:31:48.580
In joining with Britain in the acts of union in 1801 Ireland's parliament was

512
00:31:48.581 --> 00:31:52.600
dissolved and it came under the direct rural of the parliament in Westminster

513
00:31:52.840 --> 00:31:57.100
with a nations of Britain and Ireland effectively legally joined the Catholic

514
00:31:57.101 --> 00:32:01.540
majority of our land was no longer as much of an issue as the country now,

515
00:32:01.541 --> 00:32:02.470
including Britain,

516
00:32:02.800 --> 00:32:06.670
wasn't majority Protestant nation on the whole with Napoleon,

517
00:32:06.671 --> 00:32:09.010
me getting a set of sites on the whole of Europe,

518
00:32:09.040 --> 00:32:13.240
Britain furthermore could not risk another Irish incident and had to subjugate

519
00:32:13.241 --> 00:32:15.100
the island further Ireland.

520
00:32:15.190 --> 00:32:19.420
Now a full fledged member of the United Kingdom would experience a number of

521
00:32:19.421 --> 00:32:22.630
political and economic benefits though as usual,

522
00:32:22.780 --> 00:32:25.000
mostly favoring the Protestant elite.

523
00:32:25.300 --> 00:32:29.320
The political perspective of much of the Catholic populous remained mostly

524
00:32:29.321 --> 00:32:31.900
unchanged,
especially one once more.

525
00:32:31.930 --> 00:32:35.680
The government had promised to deliver certain rights to the Catholics,

526
00:32:35.710 --> 00:32:39.620
but then with great influence from King George,
the third one on it,

527
00:32:39.860 --> 00:32:44.180
magick varland remained impoverished and underdeveloped and there was still talk

528
00:32:44.181 --> 00:32:45.710
of resistance and rebellion.

529
00:32:46.070 --> 00:32:49.880
Another rebellion was attempted under an Irishman exiled in France,
however,

530
00:32:49.940 --> 00:32:53.030
named Robert Emmet Emmet designed new weapons,

531
00:32:53.060 --> 00:32:57.080
trained a group of soldiers and made detailed plans regarding his rebellion,

532
00:32:57.140 --> 00:33:01.130
which would begin by taking Dublin Castle.
Unfortunately for him,

533
00:33:01.160 --> 00:33:05.780
when his rebellion took place in 1803 it amounted to less than a city riots.

534
00:33:05.930 --> 00:33:08.810
Less than 100 people were killed on both sides,

535
00:33:08.811 --> 00:33:11.870
and Emmett was later captured and executed.

536
00:33:12.440 --> 00:33:15.830
So his rebellion is a footnote among the many rebellions in Ireland.

537
00:33:15.830 --> 00:33:19.640
He's remembered more so for his words prior to his execution.

538
00:33:21.170 --> 00:33:23.710
Let no man right my epitaph first,

539
00:33:23.770 --> 00:33:26.540
no men who knows my motives there now vindicate them,

540
00:33:26.660 --> 00:33:30.740
let not prejudice or ignorance disperse them,
let them and to me,

541
00:33:30.741 --> 00:33:34.650
rest and obscurity and peace and my tomb remain uninstall,
cried,

542
00:33:34.651 --> 00:33:36.170
and my memory in oblivion.

543
00:33:36.500 --> 00:33:40.400
Until other times and other men can do justice to my character.

544
00:33:41.030 --> 00:33:45.500
When my country takes your place among the nations of the earth then and not

545
00:33:45.501 --> 00:33:48.200
till then led to my epitaph be written,

546
00:33:48.680 --> 00:33:53.680
I have done Ireland continued in a similar state as it had for the past century.

547
00:33:54.440 --> 00:33:57.620
Protestants held the power of the country and the Catholics remained a

548
00:33:57.621 --> 00:34:00.680
subjugated.
People prod us at land ownership,

549
00:34:00.681 --> 00:34:05.681
especially from absentee landlords and a lack of agricultural development meant

550
00:34:05.691 --> 00:34:09.620
that farming was a mess for the lower orders in Ireland and poor yields

551
00:34:09.621 --> 00:34:14.621
resulting and feminine and deaths were common between 1816 and 1842 there were

552
00:34:15.951 --> 00:34:19.190
16 incidents of minor to major famines in Ireland,

553
00:34:19.191 --> 00:34:23.600
including one in 1816 often regarded as the year of no summer.

554
00:34:23.900 --> 00:34:28.370
A volcanic eruption in Indonesia caused the dust and debris to block out the

555
00:34:28.371 --> 00:34:29.150
sun.

556
00:34:29.150 --> 00:34:33.380
Snow fell in June and July and crop yields reduced sharply.

557
00:34:33.680 --> 00:34:37.610
Arland relying on subsistence farming suffered considerably.

558
00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:40.880
As you've seen.
These were not the first famines in Ireland,

559
00:34:40.940 --> 00:34:42.800
nor would they be the last.

560
00:34:43.160 --> 00:34:47.870
These issues were exacerbated by taxation.
The most angering of all taxes,

561
00:34:47.871 --> 00:34:51.230
where those placed on Catholics to support the Protestant church.

562
00:34:51.440 --> 00:34:56.030
The amount of poverty and unrest led to an increase in violence and crime.

563
00:34:56.210 --> 00:34:59.630
Rural Ireland was a dangerous and to mulch was place.

564
00:35:00.050 --> 00:35:01.940
Not only were the Irish suffering,

565
00:35:01.970 --> 00:35:05.840
but they were angered by what they felt was a lack of means to do much about

566
00:35:05.841 --> 00:35:06.674
their situation.

567
00:35:06.770 --> 00:35:11.570
In 1823 are wealthy Catholic named Daniel O'connell began to make efforts to try

568
00:35:11.571 --> 00:35:13.610
to change the situation in Ireland.

569
00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:18.400
He believed that much of Ireland's difficulties were rooted in the fact that

570
00:35:18.410 --> 00:35:22.910
Catholics remained second class citizens and he felt that rallying their voice

571
00:35:22.911 --> 00:35:25.340
would have a positive impact on the country.

572
00:35:25.730 --> 00:35:27.920
He founded the Catholic Association,

573
00:35:27.980 --> 00:35:30.830
a group of Catholics dedicated toward his ideas,

574
00:35:30.860 --> 00:35:35.300
which for the cost of only one penny a month attracted the peasantry who were

575
00:35:35.301 --> 00:35:38.610
hit hardest by the situation.
Within five years,

576
00:35:38.640 --> 00:35:41.700
O'connell would make the bold move to run for parliament,

577
00:35:41.730 --> 00:35:43.500
the first Catholic to do so.

578
00:35:43.530 --> 00:35:48.530
Since the 16 hundreds he won the election and the British had to decide what to

579
00:35:48.751 --> 00:35:51.300
do.
Prime Minister Arthur Wellesley,

580
00:35:51.330 --> 00:35:56.280
hero of the Napoleonic wars and born in Dublin himself agreed to accept us

581
00:35:56.281 --> 00:35:59.250
allowing Irish Catholics of vote and enter parliament.

582
00:35:59.310 --> 00:36:03.150
Though of course under the conditions that this would be a very small portion of

583
00:36:03.151 --> 00:36:06.720
the Catholic population reserved for the wealthy minority.

584
00:36:07.380 --> 00:36:08.520
Once in parliament,

585
00:36:08.550 --> 00:36:12.600
O'connell was spent his career trying to reverse the acts of union.

586
00:36:12.720 --> 00:36:16.650
He was not a complete rebel and did not seek independence for Ireland,

587
00:36:16.890 --> 00:36:21.840
but he did want to see Ireland have more self rule and work to bring back its

588
00:36:21.841 --> 00:36:24.540
parliament for Ireland to truly prosper.

589
00:36:24.540 --> 00:36:27.900
He believes it couldn't be entirely ruled by London.

590
00:36:28.590 --> 00:36:31.290
He wouldn't succeed in his efforts towards homeroom,

591
00:36:31.350 --> 00:36:33.480
but through his rallies and protests,

592
00:36:33.481 --> 00:36:36.750
which he strongly believed should be carried out peacefully,

593
00:36:37.020 --> 00:36:41.970
he would be a powerful forest in rallying the Irish voice wants more is peaceful

594
00:36:41.971 --> 00:36:46.710
nature would be instrumental in reversing the Protestant perspective that the

595
00:36:46.710 --> 00:36:49.770
Irish Catholics were a wild rebel and ease the fears of the ulcer.

596
00:36:49.771 --> 00:36:53.670
Protestants that this would need to trouble and insurrection.
Though,

597
00:36:53.671 --> 00:36:57.510
as these movements went on,
as I had throughout much of Irish history,

598
00:36:57.870 --> 00:37:02.870
Ireland was beginning to face a new threat from a new invader across Europe.

599
00:37:03.540 --> 00:37:07.800
A potato blight was moving westward,
affecting millions in Belgium,
Denmark,

600
00:37:07.830 --> 00:37:09.690
France,
Germany,
and the UK.

601
00:37:09.810 --> 00:37:13.860
But when it came to Ireland in 1845 it would hit hardest of all.

602
00:37:14.220 --> 00:37:17.220
Ireland was experiencing a population boom.

603
00:37:17.310 --> 00:37:21.570
It was now home to about 8 million people and it had achieved these numbers

604
00:37:21.571 --> 00:37:26.010
without all the agricultural advancements of the industrial revolution to be

605
00:37:26.011 --> 00:37:30.780
found and the rest of Britain and for the more with a great reliance on a single

606
00:37:30.781 --> 00:37:34.650
crop,
the potato and only a single kind of potato,

607
00:37:34.680 --> 00:37:38.580
which was now under threat when the great portion of this crop throughout the

608
00:37:38.581 --> 00:37:43.440
country became slowly annetable this feminine among all the others in Irish

609
00:37:43.441 --> 00:37:47.130
history around the name on Gordon Moore,
the great death,

610
00:37:47.370 --> 00:37:50.790
none more commonly in English as the Irish potato famine,

611
00:37:50.940 --> 00:37:53.980
the potato blight caused by field Toyota in face,

612
00:37:53.981 --> 00:37:58.770
Don's would cause up to 2 million people to either die or leave Ireland.

613
00:37:59.310 --> 00:38:04.080
The British government had a limited response at first grain and corn shipments

614
00:38:04.081 --> 00:38:07.830
were sent to Ireland and the government employed the impoverished and harsh

615
00:38:07.831 --> 00:38:09.570
labor to be able to afford food.

616
00:38:09.750 --> 00:38:13.830
But in 1846 when the feminine truly started taking a toll,

617
00:38:14.040 --> 00:38:16.170
John Russell became prime minister.

618
00:38:16.710 --> 00:38:21.710
He enacted a laissez faire economic policy and stop the shipments believing that

619
00:38:21.751 --> 00:38:25.080
it wasn't an issue for which the government should be responsible.

620
00:38:25.620 --> 00:38:29.220
There was a mix of response among the British landlords.

621
00:38:29.580 --> 00:38:33.780
Some would go bankrupt in efforts to try to help the Irish poor,

622
00:38:33.870 --> 00:38:38.860
but many absentee would simply evict the impoverished workers and continue to

623
00:38:38.861 --> 00:38:43.330
ship other sources of food out of Ireland in the face of people starving and

624
00:38:43.331 --> 00:38:44.380
dying in the streets.

625
00:38:44.710 --> 00:38:48.100
One of the main government officials involved in colonial efforts,

626
00:38:48.130 --> 00:38:52.930
Charles Trevelyan openly claimed that the famine was a lesson from God.

627
00:38:53.050 --> 00:38:57.910
It was a punishment on Catholics and it was necessary to teach them to be less

628
00:38:57.911 --> 00:38:59.230
reliant on the government.

629
00:38:59.410 --> 00:39:04.090
This event remains one of the most controversial and the history of British and

630
00:39:04.091 --> 00:39:05.650
Irish relations to this day.

631
00:39:05.651 --> 00:39:10.300
As some continued to argue that the Irish were primarily responsible for their

632
00:39:10.301 --> 00:39:11.134
own feminine.

633
00:39:11.170 --> 00:39:15.130
Others argue that the English were guilty of genocide or something close to it

634
00:39:15.520 --> 00:39:19.690
and others argued that no one side was to blame and that both sides made

635
00:39:19.691 --> 00:39:22.510
mistakes in an almost unstoppable event.

636
00:39:23.140 --> 00:39:26.860
1847 is remembered as the black year of the famine.

637
00:39:27.190 --> 00:39:31.180
400,000 people died in black,
47 alone.

638
00:39:31.690 --> 00:39:36.690
Many died from diseases caused by weakness before starvation could kill them a

639
00:39:37.420 --> 00:39:37.480
year later.

640
00:39:37.480 --> 00:39:42.480
The drastic effects of this would encourage the failed 1848 rebellion.

641
00:39:42.790 --> 00:39:44.950
Many of those who could left Ireland.

642
00:39:45.190 --> 00:39:48.610
Immigration from Ireland had been common in the 19th century,

643
00:39:48.611 --> 00:39:53.611
but the famine would greatly intensified these numbers as Irish crowded on boats

644
00:39:53.710 --> 00:39:58.710
and unsanitary and dangerous ships to brave the voyage to places of opportunity

645
00:39:59.020 --> 00:40:03.670
such as nearby Britain,
Canada,
Australia,
and the United States.

646
00:40:04.270 --> 00:40:06.190
Some would later return to Ireland,

647
00:40:06.220 --> 00:40:10.120
but the great majority would go on living and these new countries and before

648
00:40:10.121 --> 00:40:15.040
long that ascendance of Irish emigrants would greatly outnumber the population

649
00:40:15.041 --> 00:40:17.230
of Ireland itself in America.

650
00:40:17.260 --> 00:40:20.860
They would form large communities and cities like Boston and New York,

651
00:40:20.950 --> 00:40:24.820
but what also move westward and the country's great expansion with the

652
00:40:24.821 --> 00:40:28.930
conditions from which the Irish came and the ones in which they found themselves

653
00:40:28.931 --> 00:40:29.980
and their new homelands,

654
00:40:30.250 --> 00:40:35.170
they faced heavy discrimination within a generation of assimilation.
However,

655
00:40:35.410 --> 00:40:40.000
much of this discrimination and stigma largely disappeared and the Irish became

656
00:40:40.001 --> 00:40:43.150
an integral part of the societies to which they immigrated.

657
00:40:43.360 --> 00:40:44.860
At the end of the feminine.

658
00:40:44.861 --> 00:40:49.690
In 1850 a quarter of the Irish population had died or emigrated,

659
00:40:49.840 --> 00:40:53.320
equaling about a million dead and a million who left.

660
00:40:53.350 --> 00:40:56.530
Many would continue to emigrate even after the famine.

661
00:40:56.980 --> 00:41:01.660
Many who left outside of Ulster.
We're among Ireland's more skilled and educated,

662
00:41:02.140 --> 00:41:04.600
which would damage our society further.

663
00:41:05.020 --> 00:41:09.760
Those who stayed bitterly resented the British and the more peaceful movements

664
00:41:09.761 --> 00:41:14.200
under men like Daniel O'connell slowly faded to more violent ones.

665
00:41:14.620 --> 00:41:16.700
This rebellious sentiment.
However,

666
00:41:16.701 --> 00:41:21.340
we coalesce into a greater movement among the emigrants abroad and many Irish

667
00:41:21.341 --> 00:41:24.550
separatist groups were rooted in the United States,

668
00:41:24.850 --> 00:41:29.380
such as the colon of Gayle and the Irish Republican brotherhood known also as a

669
00:41:29.500 --> 00:41:34.500
Finian's in 1858 for decades after the and among the Irish would be mostly

670
00:41:35.121 --> 00:41:39.800
focused on reform resistance and revenge at home and abroad.

671
00:41:40.340 --> 00:41:45.340
In 1867 to Finian's attempted a rebellion in Ireland in the late sixties and

672
00:41:45.591 --> 00:41:50.390
early seventies the Finian's and America,
many of whom were civil war veterans,

673
00:41:50.420 --> 00:41:52.910
staged raids on the Canadian border,

674
00:41:52.970 --> 00:41:57.410
which can is skirmishes intended to cause many Irish Canadians to rise up and

675
00:41:57.411 --> 00:42:01.100
put pressure on the British government to lessen their grip on Ireland.

676
00:42:01.340 --> 00:42:05.090
But such rates failed.
The American government condemn the raids,

677
00:42:05.091 --> 00:42:09.890
but interestingly may have turned a blind eye to them because of Canadian and

678
00:42:09.891 --> 00:42:13.610
British uncertainty on a side in the American civil war.

679
00:42:13.790 --> 00:42:17.990
The Irish Republican brotherhood would nevertheless continue in its resistance

680
00:42:17.991 --> 00:42:19.910
to British domination of the island,

681
00:42:19.911 --> 00:42:23.990
oftentimes resorting to the first acts of Irish terrorism.

682
00:42:24.230 --> 00:42:28.310
In 1878 the potato blight returned to Ireland sparking.

683
00:42:28.311 --> 00:42:33.311
What does remembered as a land war crops failed and impoverished laborers were

684
00:42:33.561 --> 00:42:35.750
once more evicted from their homes.

685
00:42:35.780 --> 00:42:40.280
The economy suffered and the threat of a return of the great feminine concerned

686
00:42:40.310 --> 00:42:44.780
the Irish greatly unrest brood.
And in response to this,

687
00:42:44.781 --> 00:42:48.140
the Irish national land league arose under Michael Debit,

688
00:42:48.290 --> 00:42:51.650
a former fenian demanding rights for the tenant farmers.

689
00:42:51.710 --> 00:42:55.910
The league's primary goals are summarized as the three F's,

690
00:42:56.210 --> 00:42:59.840
fair rent,
fixity of tenure and freedom of sale.

691
00:43:00.050 --> 00:43:04.730
They want it to avoid outrageously high rent from absentee English landlords

692
00:43:04.810 --> 00:43:09.560
wanting to avoid eviction by agreeing to a length of time in which they stayed

693
00:43:09.561 --> 00:43:13.550
on their land and the right to be involved in the sale of the land.

694
00:43:13.790 --> 00:43:14.630
Essentially,

695
00:43:14.660 --> 00:43:18.770
they wanted to bring more power to the tenant farmers from the absentee

696
00:43:18.771 --> 00:43:23.240
landlords and to reverse the most negative effects of English rule over lands,

697
00:43:23.241 --> 00:43:27.050
which they felt were unjustly stolen from their ancestors.

698
00:43:27.110 --> 00:43:30.740
What are the most effective means of resistance was to avoid business and

699
00:43:30.741 --> 00:43:35.180
socialization with landlords and those who did business with them who were

700
00:43:35.181 --> 00:43:37.580
corrupt or unfair to the Irish people.

701
00:43:37.730 --> 00:43:42.620
One of the first to suffer from this practice in Ireland was captain Charles

702
00:43:42.620 --> 00:43:47.210
Cunningham boycott after whom the act was named and spread across the English

703
00:43:47.211 --> 00:43:48.044
language.

704
00:43:48.230 --> 00:43:52.850
British Prime Minister William Gladstone continued his work to try to return the

705
00:43:52.851 --> 00:43:57.530
land to the Irish failing to have done so at this point could have resulted in

706
00:43:57.531 --> 00:43:59.600
major insurrection.
Yet again,

707
00:43:59.900 --> 00:44:03.140
such movements in Ireland would not end here.
However,

708
00:44:03.560 --> 00:44:07.850
in 1875 Charles Stewart par no was elected into parliament.

709
00:44:08.060 --> 00:44:13.040
He would work with glass and on an even bigger change the move toward Irish home

710
00:44:13.041 --> 00:44:17.690
rule,
not independence,
but in Irish parliament and greater autonomy.

711
00:44:18.080 --> 00:44:19.220
Later in his career,

712
00:44:19.221 --> 00:44:22.550
he would make alliances with the Finian's and the Irish Land League,

713
00:44:22.640 --> 00:44:24.980
which was obviously concerning to the English.

714
00:44:25.280 --> 00:44:29.330
In 1886 a home rural bill was introduced to parliament,

715
00:44:29.450 --> 00:44:34.230
but it was turned down fearing it because a breakup of the entire empire.

716
00:44:34.410 --> 00:44:37.170
If Ireland,
Britain's neighbor could resist,

717
00:44:37.260 --> 00:44:41.340
then what have more troublesome places like South Africa or India.

718
00:44:41.910 --> 00:44:46.910
Following this Gladstone's party lost power in Parnell was greatly embarrassed

719
00:44:47.281 --> 00:44:51.210
in the discovery of an ongoing sex scandal with a married woman.

720
00:44:51.420 --> 00:44:55.380
He died in 1891 at the age of 45 from pneumonia.

721
00:44:55.530 --> 00:45:00.090
This movement itself had largely fallen apart,
but the spirit of it had not.

722
00:45:00.150 --> 00:45:05.150
And it coincided with a returned interests in Irish nationalism and Irish

723
00:45:05.311 --> 00:45:06.144
identity.

724
00:45:06.150 --> 00:45:10.530
The Irish people challenge the culture which they felt was becoming worryingly

725
00:45:10.531 --> 00:45:13.530
foreign in an effort to save their own from extinction.

726
00:45:13.770 --> 00:45:18.770
Old Customs culture history and the revival of the language returned in this age

727
00:45:19.410 --> 00:45:21.630
with the question of home rule on the table.

728
00:45:21.870 --> 00:45:26.640
Organizations like con run a gala dedicated to preserving the Irish language

729
00:45:26.641 --> 00:45:30.570
were founded.
Many great figures like Oscar Wilde and William Butler.

730
00:45:30.571 --> 00:45:35.571
Yeats lived in his time home rule was enticing to Ireland except of course,

731
00:45:35.731 --> 00:45:37.830
and Ulster where the inheritance,

732
00:45:37.860 --> 00:45:42.570
namely the Protestant church and the Orange Order requite openly against it,

733
00:45:42.780 --> 00:45:46.380
much of their position rested in union with the British.

734
00:45:46.500 --> 00:45:50.430
They weren't interested in separatism with a nation which might not benefit them

735
00:45:50.431 --> 00:45:55.320
as much.
Many unionists met in Belfast,
work against Irish home rule.

736
00:45:55.500 --> 00:45:59.280
The government made attempts to push the questions decide by appeasing the

737
00:45:59.281 --> 00:46:03.600
rabble with the land purchase act of 1903 but it did not work.

738
00:46:03.601 --> 00:46:04.434
To that end.

739
00:46:04.950 --> 00:46:09.780
By 1912 the question of Irish home rule was back on the table in parliament.

740
00:46:09.870 --> 00:46:12.240
It was approved and was set to take effect.

741
00:46:12.241 --> 00:46:17.241
In September of 1914 Britain had to take a measure to secure rule over Ireland

742
00:46:18.510 --> 00:46:20.970
and granted the country its own parliament again,

743
00:46:21.330 --> 00:46:23.970
but still not everyone was satisfied.

744
00:46:24.390 --> 00:46:29.390
Nearly 500,000 unionist sign the Ulster Covenant on September 28th of that year,

745
00:46:30.480 --> 00:46:34.590
swearing to use any means necessary to prevent home rule.

746
00:46:34.740 --> 00:46:39.060
The first man to his sign was Sir Edward Henry Carson the following year,

747
00:46:39.061 --> 00:46:44.061
a militia known as the Ulster Volunteer Force was organized with 100,000 men

748
00:46:44.910 --> 00:46:46.410
prepared to go to war.

749
00:46:46.411 --> 00:46:50.250
It could offend their place in the British empire even if it were London who

750
00:46:50.251 --> 00:46:51.900
delivered home rule to the Irish.

751
00:46:51.960 --> 00:46:56.760
Irish nationalists formed the Irish volunteers and the Irish citizen army as a

752
00:46:56.761 --> 00:47:00.570
response.
The island's seemed on the brink of civil war.

753
00:47:00.720 --> 00:47:05.520
This civil war may very well have come if not for external problems.

754
00:47:05.970 --> 00:47:10.970
In 1914 world war one broke out dragging the British empire along with Ireland

755
00:47:12.060 --> 00:47:15.330
into war with Germany,
Austria,
and the Ottoman Empire.

756
00:47:15.420 --> 00:47:20.420
The British needing to focus all of their attention on Germany suspended the

757
00:47:20.521 --> 00:47:23.130
home rule bill until the end of the conflict.

758
00:47:23.220 --> 00:47:27.330
While they would have liked to have frozen Ireland for the duration of the

759
00:47:27.331 --> 00:47:30.250
conflict,
it didn't quite work out that way.

760
00:47:30.430 --> 00:47:34.300
The Irish had mixed views on their participation in the war.

761
00:47:34.610 --> 00:47:38.230
Ulster loyal to the British empire,
fully participated.

762
00:47:38.410 --> 00:47:43.030
Many Irish nationalists agreed that Germany was as much of a threat to them as

763
00:47:43.031 --> 00:47:43.950
it was to Britain.

764
00:47:44.190 --> 00:47:48.280
Though a minority of nationalists firmly disagreed and would have rather just

765
00:47:48.281 --> 00:47:52.420
formed a defensive force left out of the war until absolutely necessary.

766
00:47:52.720 --> 00:47:57.720
200,000 Irish men would fight in the first world war and 30,000 with die serving

767
00:47:58.691 --> 00:48:03.400
in the British army while another 20,000 fighting and other armies such as the

768
00:48:03.401 --> 00:48:05.590
American one would perish as well.

769
00:48:05.950 --> 00:48:08.590
In the first day of the battle of the Somme.

770
00:48:08.620 --> 00:48:12.970
Over 5,000 men from the 36th olster division were killed,

771
00:48:13.180 --> 00:48:16.480
one 10th or one six depending on how you look at it,

772
00:48:16.660 --> 00:48:21.220
of all Irishmen killed in the war in a single day with many Irish fighting

773
00:48:21.221 --> 00:48:22.330
abroad.
However,

774
00:48:22.360 --> 00:48:26.890
the ones back home would take advantage of the opportunity that came with

775
00:48:26.891 --> 00:48:30.700
Britain.
Being distracted or revolution would begin in Ireland,

776
00:48:30.790 --> 00:48:34.270
not the bloodiest in Irish history,
but perhaps the most important

777
00:48:40.470 --> 00:48:43.480
urgent with Britain,
distracted by the war.

778
00:48:43.481 --> 00:48:47.110
Radical Irish nationalists felt it was their time to move.

779
00:48:47.350 --> 00:48:51.760
They began plotting rebellion,
even attempting to gain help from the Germans.

780
00:48:51.790 --> 00:48:55.210
Though a shipment of German rifles was prevented by the British navy.

781
00:48:55.510 --> 00:48:59.230
On April 24th,
1916 Easter Monday,

782
00:48:59.530 --> 00:49:04.420
a group of Irish radicals took control of key public buildings in Dublin and

783
00:49:04.421 --> 00:49:08.110
declare the formation of the independent Irish Republic.

784
00:49:08.230 --> 00:49:13.230
They flew the Irish tricolor created in 1848 and modeled off the flag of the

785
00:49:14.111 --> 00:49:14.980
French republic.

786
00:49:15.040 --> 00:49:19.210
The white in the middle of the green and orange symbolize the hopes of a

787
00:49:19.211 --> 00:49:23.980
unification between Catholics and Protestants.
The British were caught off guard,

788
00:49:24.010 --> 00:49:26.830
but when they responded,
they did so brutally.

789
00:49:26.980 --> 00:49:30.400
485 were killed on both sides.

790
00:49:30.460 --> 00:49:34.930
Thousands were wounded and much of central Dublin was a steroid and a fighting.

791
00:49:35.110 --> 00:49:36.550
The leaders of the rebellion,

792
00:49:36.551 --> 00:49:41.551
ricotta and executed not many Irishmen had immediately risen up to take part in

793
00:49:42.251 --> 00:49:42.911
the revolution.

794
00:49:42.911 --> 00:49:47.470
But when Britain and their eyes excessively punished Ireland for the uprising by

795
00:49:47.471 --> 00:49:51.790
putting a country under martial law and imprisoning many innocent people,

796
00:49:51.850 --> 00:49:54.670
it sparked a greater revolutionary sentiment.

797
00:49:54.730 --> 00:49:57.880
The leading Irish political party Shin Feign,

798
00:49:57.970 --> 00:50:00.790
which was incorrectly blamed for the uprising,

799
00:50:01.030 --> 00:50:05.980
took advantage of the situation and created its own parliament called doll Erin

800
00:50:06.040 --> 00:50:07.660
rejecting British rule.

801
00:50:07.840 --> 00:50:11.710
It created the Irish Republican Army to defend its cause.

802
00:50:11.890 --> 00:50:15.760
When the British began conscription in Ireland matters became worse.

803
00:50:15.910 --> 00:50:19.030
And when World War One ended,
things began to pick up.

804
00:50:19.390 --> 00:50:22.990
A few months later on the 21st of January,

805
00:50:22.990 --> 00:50:25.870
1919 the Irish war of independence had begun.

806
00:50:26.500 --> 00:50:28.760
Leading the movement was Ayman de Valera,

807
00:50:28.820 --> 00:50:32.570
Arthur Griffiths and the military commander,
Michael Collins.

808
00:50:32.690 --> 00:50:36.830
The British would later reinforce the Royal Irish constabulary with a force

809
00:50:36.831 --> 00:50:40.970
known as the black and tans.
After the color of the uniforms.

810
00:50:41.180 --> 00:50:45.290
They were largely veterans of the first World War and they would ruthlessly

811
00:50:45.291 --> 00:50:47.150
pursue the Irish Republican Army.

812
00:50:47.151 --> 00:50:51.500
Now fighting a guerrilla war against the British,
including targeting civilians,

813
00:50:51.530 --> 00:50:56.300
but the black and tans or in a special reputation for it,
rape,
murder,

814
00:50:56.330 --> 00:50:59.570
torture,
and the burning of entire villages were common.

815
00:50:59.600 --> 00:51:02.120
They killed priests and politicians.

816
00:51:02.180 --> 00:51:05.540
One famous incident was the killing of Thomas McCurtain,

817
00:51:05.810 --> 00:51:07.220
the Lord Mayor of Cork,

818
00:51:07.221 --> 00:51:11.090
and a longtime rebel who was killed and his home in front of his wife.

819
00:51:11.210 --> 00:51:14.780
One of the most famous incidents of the overall war,
however,

820
00:51:14.840 --> 00:51:16.340
was bloody Sunday.

821
00:51:16.370 --> 00:51:21.370
On November 21st Michael Collins ordered the killing of a number of top British

822
00:51:21.891 --> 00:51:26.630
army officer is and intelligence network officials.
11 were killed,

823
00:51:26.690 --> 00:51:31.220
three were wounded.
The black and tans responded by killing three Irish soldiers.

824
00:51:31.221 --> 00:51:35.750
They were holding prisoner and opening fire on a crowd of civilians at a

825
00:51:35.751 --> 00:51:37.670
football match.
That year.

826
00:51:37.700 --> 00:51:41.510
The British government gave Northern Ireland in Belfast home rule,

827
00:51:41.750 --> 00:51:45.830
though the divides between the north and south were rooted in history.

828
00:51:45.830 --> 00:51:47.000
Hundreds of years old.

829
00:51:47.300 --> 00:51:52.300
This was the beginning of the divide between the modern nation of Ireland and

830
00:51:52.401 --> 00:51:56.750
Northern Ireland,
which to this day remains in the United Kingdom.

831
00:51:56.870 --> 00:51:59.210
Southern Ireland continued.
It's fighting,

832
00:51:59.211 --> 00:52:03.890
but many on both sides would be eager to end the conflict.
By the following year,

833
00:52:03.980 --> 00:52:08.980
peace talks began in October of 1921 with Michael Collins and Arthur Griffith

834
00:52:10.191 --> 00:52:14.960
attending but not and the Valera to the disappointment of the Irish.

835
00:52:14.961 --> 00:52:18.500
The situation of Northern Ireland was not up for debate.

836
00:52:18.710 --> 00:52:22.970
Six of the 32 Irish counties would remain in the UK.

837
00:52:23.090 --> 00:52:27.740
However,
the two sides agreed to the formation of the Irish Free State.

838
00:52:28.010 --> 00:52:31.880
This was not a 100% independent nation,

839
00:52:32.060 --> 00:52:36.260
but it did function fairly independently in a similar way as Canada.

840
00:52:36.261 --> 00:52:37.220
At the same time,

841
00:52:37.580 --> 00:52:42.580
in 1921 the British had ruled Ireland for 754 years.

842
00:52:43.670 --> 00:52:48.670
Collins believed that this agreement was the first step to creating a truly free

843
00:52:49.221 --> 00:52:53.000
Irish nation,
that it's people had sought all that time,

844
00:52:53.300 --> 00:52:56.390
but others back home like de Valera disagreed.

845
00:52:56.870 --> 00:53:00.110
He believed and nothing less than total independence.

846
00:53:00.350 --> 00:53:05.090
In January of 1922 the doll put the treaty with Britain to a vote.

847
00:53:05.360 --> 00:53:07.400
64 members were in favor.

848
00:53:07.430 --> 00:53:12.430
57 we're against bill losing half did not accept its situation peacefully.

849
00:53:12.650 --> 00:53:17.270
And by June as civil war broke out with Collins on one end and de Valera on the

850
00:53:17.271 --> 00:53:19.310
other,
in August of that year,

851
00:53:19.430 --> 00:53:23.450
Griffith died of a heart attack and Michael Collins was killed in an ambush.

852
00:53:23.480 --> 00:53:26.910
Nevertheless,
in 1923 due to British help,

853
00:53:27.240 --> 00:53:31.710
the civil war was over what the Free State of victory and de Valera surrendered

854
00:53:31.890 --> 00:53:36.890
and all 3000 people had died in the fighting of both wars to the Irish.

855
00:53:37.470 --> 00:53:42.090
The men and women who had died had made the ultimate sacrifice for a nation,

856
00:53:42.091 --> 00:53:44.250
which now had a new future.

857
00:53:50.220 --> 00:53:54.510
Both the Irish and Northern Irish resenting each other for the positions they

858
00:53:54.511 --> 00:53:57.870
had taken,
but many were glad to be separated from each other.

859
00:53:57.871 --> 00:54:00.150
And on their way toward a new future,

860
00:54:00.151 --> 00:54:04.290
which they hoped would be free from the fear that the other would take over.

861
00:54:04.440 --> 00:54:08.940
Ireland and Northern Ireland began to adapt the new ways of doing things

862
00:54:08.941 --> 00:54:13.350
politically,
economically,
socially,
culturally,
legally,
militarily,

863
00:54:13.351 --> 00:54:16.230
et cetera.
In a rather complicated time.

864
00:54:16.530 --> 00:54:21.530
Fascism and communism were on the rise and it looked as the war was brewing in

865
00:54:21.661 --> 00:54:23.760
Europe,
yet again,
it did,

866
00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:28.440
and when Britain became involved in what would become the second world war

867
00:54:28.441 --> 00:54:29.370
against Germany,

868
00:54:29.700 --> 00:54:33.570
though Churchill and Roosevelt encouraged Irish involvement,

869
00:54:33.630 --> 00:54:35.550
the Irish remained neutral.

870
00:54:35.760 --> 00:54:38.700
The leader of the government at the time was de Valera,

871
00:54:38.730 --> 00:54:41.300
who clearly was pardoned for that whole rebellion,

872
00:54:41.310 --> 00:54:45.990
saying a decade earlier and felt that the nation was not in the right situation

873
00:54:45.991 --> 00:54:48.300
to be involved in such a major war,

874
00:54:48.420 --> 00:54:53.250
nor was it exactly in his eyes a war in which the Irish had to be involved

875
00:54:53.430 --> 00:54:56.400
naturally though,
and the Irish government favor of the British,

876
00:54:56.460 --> 00:54:58.320
they were affected by British losses,

877
00:54:58.321 --> 00:55:02.970
and thousands of volunteers joined the British fight while hundreds of thousands

878
00:55:02.971 --> 00:55:06.660
of others worked in British jobs,
Northern Ireland.
However,

879
00:55:06.690 --> 00:55:11.610
as a part of the United Kingdom join the fight fully and was even bombed by the

880
00:55:11.611 --> 00:55:16.611
German air force multiple times for its strategic naval importance during such

881
00:55:16.951 --> 00:55:17.670
bombings,

882
00:55:17.670 --> 00:55:22.110
firefighters from the south often helped the northerners recover and they would

883
00:55:22.111 --> 00:55:25.380
even detain German pilots.
When the war was over,

884
00:55:25.381 --> 00:55:29.370
the allies still somewhat frowned on.
The Irish neutrality.

885
00:55:29.490 --> 00:55:34.490
Churchill even refer to the Valera as useless and the Soviet Union argued

886
00:55:34.561 --> 00:55:38.680
against their admission to the United Nations claiming that the Irish were

887
00:55:38.700 --> 00:55:40.290
fascist sympathizers.

888
00:55:40.560 --> 00:55:44.460
I encourage you to decide for yourself whether you think Arlin should have done

889
00:55:44.461 --> 00:55:48.180
more or whether they were justified in sitting one out.

890
00:55:48.360 --> 00:55:53.360
In 1949 the Irish Free State became a fully independent republic.

891
00:55:54.750 --> 00:55:56.520
Though finally independent.

892
00:55:56.580 --> 00:56:01.080
That desire for unification between Ireland and Northern Ireland never truly

893
00:56:01.081 --> 00:56:01.914
disappeared.

894
00:56:02.130 --> 00:56:06.240
Even as a two countries set off further and our separate ways and began to

895
00:56:06.241 --> 00:56:09.180
modernize.
Unfortunately for the island,

896
00:56:09.181 --> 00:56:12.390
it would not be so simple as going separate ways.

897
00:56:12.391 --> 00:56:16.740
As a significant Catholic minority remained in Northern Ireland,

898
00:56:16.890 --> 00:56:19.470
Protestants and Catholics remained segregated.

899
00:56:19.620 --> 00:56:24.190
Catholics often felt that they were still second class citizens in regard to

900
00:56:24.191 --> 00:56:25.690
employment,
education,

901
00:56:25.691 --> 00:56:30.070
and living economic difficulties in Northern Ireland worried the Protestant

902
00:56:30.071 --> 00:56:34.660
community of foreign threats,
namely of an Irish nationalists takeover.

903
00:56:34.930 --> 00:56:37.250
In 1968 [inaudible],

904
00:56:37.420 --> 00:56:42.190
the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association was founded with the interest of

905
00:56:42.191 --> 00:56:46.630
guaranteeing Catholics the same rights and opportunities as Protestants,

906
00:56:46.900 --> 00:56:50.590
though things would not go down so well that decade,

907
00:56:50.680 --> 00:56:54.550
these differences would lead to a conflict in Northern Ireland,

908
00:56:54.551 --> 00:56:58.960
known as the troubles between Irish Para military organizations,

909
00:56:58.990 --> 00:57:02.290
Ulster loyalist paramilitaries,
and the British army.

910
00:57:02.500 --> 00:57:07.150
It would quickly evolve into a political and ethnic conflict rather than an

911
00:57:07.151 --> 00:57:11.740
actual debate of Catholicism and Protestantism with the olster loyalist

912
00:57:11.741 --> 00:57:12.191
offending,

913
00:57:12.191 --> 00:57:16.690
what they saw as their union with Britain and the Irish attacking what they saw

914
00:57:16.691 --> 00:57:21.691
as an age old incursion on their island protestors clashed on the streets.

915
00:57:21.850 --> 00:57:24.100
When the situation became out of control,

916
00:57:24.160 --> 00:57:28.810
the British military was sent into the area.
In 1969 civilians,

917
00:57:28.811 --> 00:57:32.260
police and soldiers were killed and outbreaks of violence.

918
00:57:32.440 --> 00:57:36.550
The Irish Republican Army arose again pledging to fight for the rights of

919
00:57:36.551 --> 00:57:37.990
Catholics in the area.

920
00:57:38.230 --> 00:57:42.760
Many men and women fearing that the British government had taken aside of the

921
00:57:42.761 --> 00:57:46.870
Northern Irish or at least fail to protect them,
began to support them.

922
00:57:47.110 --> 00:57:52.060
The IRA began a campaign of terrorism and guerrilla warfare and the region

923
00:57:52.120 --> 00:57:57.120
bombing specific targets of national and economic importance to the Northern

924
00:57:57.610 --> 00:58:02.610
Irish and 1972 Northern Ireland was once again put on a direct rule from London

925
00:58:03.910 --> 00:58:06.400
as the situation fail to resolve.

926
00:58:06.490 --> 00:58:11.490
The Provisional IRA continued the war now aiming indeed to unite Arland and

927
00:58:12.311 --> 00:58:13.630
expelled the British,

928
00:58:13.720 --> 00:58:18.720
the unionist paramilitaries acted and what they saw as self defense and the

929
00:58:19.061 --> 00:58:23.740
British government acted mainly to secure the area and and the violence.

930
00:58:24.250 --> 00:58:28.630
In 1974 the IRA bomb the number of soldiers in Scotland.

931
00:58:28.930 --> 00:58:32.770
In 1976 the British ambassador to Ireland was killed.

932
00:58:32.890 --> 00:58:35.290
In 1979 the queen's cousin,

933
00:58:35.440 --> 00:58:40.330
the Earl of mountain baton of Burma was killed in 1984 Margaret Thatcher was

934
00:58:40.331 --> 00:58:45.331
targeted but survived throughout the nineties many areas of London were

935
00:58:45.521 --> 00:58:46.354
attacked.

936
00:58:46.510 --> 00:58:51.510
By 1989 almost 3000 people of all walks of life had been killed in the fighting

937
00:58:52.570 --> 00:58:57.550
and as the conflict extended into the nineties many we're hoping desperately for

938
00:58:57.551 --> 00:58:58.330
a resolution.

939
00:58:58.330 --> 00:59:03.330
By 1994 the British government announced that it had no personal pursuits in

940
00:59:03.881 --> 00:59:08.350
Ireland and sought only to object.
We defend the will of the majority.

941
00:59:08.440 --> 00:59:12.940
Many Irish nationalists laid down their arms.
Peace talks were beginning.

942
00:59:12.970 --> 00:59:16.060
They were even visited by American President,
Bill Clinton,

943
00:59:16.090 --> 00:59:19.870
who is one of many American presidents to have Irish heritage,

944
00:59:19.960 --> 00:59:21.710
peace talks and Iras.

945
00:59:21.711 --> 00:59:26.420
Eyes were taking too long and violence temporarily resumed in London,

946
00:59:26.690 --> 00:59:31.690
but by 1997 the cease fire was back on again under Prime Minister Tony Blair on

947
00:59:33.381 --> 00:59:38.150
Good Friday,
April 10th,
1998 the Belfast Agreement was signed,

948
00:59:38.210 --> 00:59:42.620
though the IRA would not truly announce the end of their armed campaign until

949
00:59:42.621 --> 00:59:44.960
2005 in total,

950
00:59:45.170 --> 00:59:50.170
3,532 people had died and over 47,000 people were injured.

951
00:59:50.960 --> 00:59:55.160
What I do want to be clear about with this is that as I have discussed in many

952
00:59:55.161 --> 00:59:59.090
of my other videos,
this history is alive and well we,

953
00:59:59.180 --> 01:00:02.720
or at least the Irish in this case are not separate from it.

954
01:00:02.840 --> 01:00:07.430
It's not something they just read about in history books or listen to an

955
01:00:07.431 --> 01:00:09.290
incredible fire of learning documentaries.

956
01:00:09.320 --> 01:00:14.320
It's something that they live and this issue dating back to the 16th century or

957
01:00:15.110 --> 01:00:17.450
maybe the 12th century,
depending on how you see it,

958
01:00:17.540 --> 01:00:20.030
is still an issue of a lot of tension,

959
01:00:20.240 --> 01:00:23.840
anger and dispute in the two countries today.
Most of us,

960
01:00:23.841 --> 01:00:26.840
I'm sure lived or were born during this dispute.

961
01:00:26.841 --> 01:00:31.070
Going back to King James the first and Henry the eighth though these conflicts

962
01:00:31.071 --> 01:00:34.460
have not disappeared.
Compare to much of its history.

963
01:00:34.760 --> 01:00:39.080
The past decade or two has been a golden age for the Republic of Ireland.

964
01:00:39.230 --> 01:00:44.230
In the two thousands it's economy was so strong that it was referred to as the

965
01:00:44.240 --> 01:00:48.080
Celtic Tiger and it standards of living became some of the best in Europe.

966
01:00:48.170 --> 01:00:52.520
Culture exploded in Ireland and a number of writers,
musicians,
politicians,

967
01:00:52.521 --> 01:00:55.880
sportsmen,
and artists around today are Irish.

968
01:00:56.180 --> 01:01:01.180
Arland entered a recession in 2008 causing unemployment to reach almost 15%

969
01:01:01.820 --> 01:01:05.450
emigration common in the past return temporarily,

970
01:01:05.570 --> 01:01:10.570
but they have since turned much round and economically Ireland is since 2014

971
01:01:11.270 --> 01:01:14.990
called the Celtic Phoenix.
The Irish language is still struggling,

972
01:01:14.991 --> 01:01:19.991
but it is making a bit of a rebound and in a world where many languages will

973
01:01:20.151 --> 01:01:22.730
unfortunately go extinct in our lifetimes,

974
01:01:22.820 --> 01:01:26.300
Irish may be among the endangered languages to survive.

975
01:01:26.660 --> 01:01:30.200
It is a language which I have already planned to learn myself today.

976
01:01:30.201 --> 01:01:34.640
Ireland struggles with many social issues which are common across the world,

977
01:01:34.670 --> 01:01:36.020
but as always,

978
01:01:36.050 --> 01:01:40.400
Ireland is making up its own mind on these issues and doing things their way.

979
01:01:40.730 --> 01:01:42.950
I hope you've enjoyed this documentary.

980
01:01:43.070 --> 01:01:47.540
My hope is that someone who is unfamiliar with Irish history can just kind of

981
01:01:47.570 --> 01:01:52.460
sit back and spend an hour and a half or so listening to this video and come out

982
01:01:52.461 --> 01:01:56.840
with a general understanding of Irish history in full and to look at the map

983
01:01:56.841 --> 01:02:00.350
differently from now on.
And of course that is my intention with all my videos,

984
01:02:00.351 --> 01:02:02.210
especially my documentaries.

985
01:02:02.300 --> 01:02:07.010
I know that this is the case for many viewers because I know here in the United

986
01:02:07.010 --> 01:02:11.450
States they don't teach Irish history apart from the potato famine and

987
01:02:11.451 --> 01:02:12.284
immigration,

988
01:02:12.530 --> 01:02:17.530
which is unfortunate given how much of our population has Irish heritage today,

989
01:02:17.841 --> 01:02:22.200
about 33 million people or 10% of the American population,

990
01:02:22.440 --> 01:02:27.440
which is interesting compared to modern Ireland's population of just 6.5 million

991
01:02:27.781 --> 01:02:28.230
people.

992
01:02:28.230 --> 01:02:33.230
My intention as always here at fire of learning is not to tell you how to think,

993
01:02:33.361 --> 01:02:36.480
but rather to give you things to think about.

994
01:02:36.660 --> 01:02:41.340
I encourage all of you to decide for yourselves what to think of Irish history,

995
01:02:41.400 --> 01:02:45.210
Northern Ireland,
Britain,
and all the issues involved here.

996
01:02:45.330 --> 01:02:50.190
I do think it is worth pointing out however,
that in Arlene's long history,

997
01:02:50.280 --> 01:02:53.250
whatever has been thrown at them,
famines,
plague,

998
01:02:53.280 --> 01:02:56.940
war with Vikings and centuries long English and British rule.

999
01:02:57.180 --> 01:02:59.700
They have always stood back up and fought,

1000
01:02:59.701 --> 01:03:04.440
do things for themselves and to remain who they are as a people if you're

1001
01:03:04.441 --> 01:03:04.921
interested.

1002
01:03:04.921 --> 01:03:08.970
I have done documentaries on the history of other countries as well as other

1003
01:03:08.971 --> 01:03:12.290
subjects like dreams,
coffee,
aliens,
terraforming,

1004
01:03:12.300 --> 01:03:15.360
and shorter video is on all kinds of subjects.

1005
01:03:15.510 --> 01:03:19.890
I'd invite you to come check those out and to subscribe to keep up with all the

1006
01:03:19.891 --> 01:03:23.460
videos I have coming in the future.
Griff Maha.
Good for watching.

1007
01:03:34.240 --> 01:03:35.073
<v 2>Hey,</v>

1008
