00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:05.100
Hello and welcome to fire of learning.
Warren Buffet,
born in Omaha,
Nebraska.

2
00:00:05.101 --> 00:00:08.430
August 30th,
1930 is an American investor,

3
00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:13.460
businessmen and philanthropist with a net worth of 82 point $9 billion.

4
00:00:14.041 --> 00:00:16.590
He is a third richest person in the world.

5
00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.480
In this video we will discuss 10 tips and pieces of advice bup it has left us

6
00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.990
which he has utilized and achieving his accomplishments and furthermore,

7
00:00:24.991 --> 00:00:28.030
which display his mentality.
So let's get into it.

8
00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.210
Number 10 someone is sitting in the shade today because someone else planted a

9
00:00:33.211 --> 00:00:34.800
tree a long time ago.

10
00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:39.630
This is a good quote to start with because this is very much how Warren Buffet

11
00:00:39.631 --> 00:00:40.464
thinks.

12
00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.820
A defining feature of his mentality is that he is a long term thinker.

13
00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.620
Often we are caught up in the short term trying to have instant reward and

14
00:00:49.621 --> 00:00:54.510
gratification when ultimately the things in which we invest in the long run may

15
00:00:54.511 --> 00:00:55.830
be the most profitable.

16
00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:01.070
Number nine it takes 20 years to build a reputation and five minutes to ruin it.

17
00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.070
This is something which is important to remember.
No matter what field you're in,

18
00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.510
it can take years to build up a reputation of being honest,
respectable,

19
00:01:09.511 --> 00:01:11.880
and trustworthy,
etc. However,

20
00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:17.130
one dishonest or unscrupulous mistake and your reputation maybe lost.

21
00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.300
Number Eight,
predicting rain doesn't count.
Building Arcs does.

22
00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:26.310
There are a lot of people who claim to have seen economic or political or social

23
00:01:26.311 --> 00:01:29.670
changes coming in the future,
both good and bad,

24
00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.410
but having seen a sudden change coming is ultimately unimportant if you have not

25
00:01:34.411 --> 00:01:39.390
prepared for it.
Number seven risk comes from not knowing what you're doing.

26
00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.770
This quote can be taken a couple of ways.
Firstly,

27
00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.670
the less you know the greater risk in which we'll find herself and your

28
00:01:47.671 --> 00:01:49.470
endeavors in general.
Secondly,

29
00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.940
there are many risks we have to take in life and their risks because we don't

30
00:01:53.941 --> 00:01:58.230
know what the outcome will be.
We can't possibly,
regardless in the end,

31
00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:02.640
the greatest risk in life may be not taking any risk at all.
Number six,

32
00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:07.800
chains of habit are too light to be felt until they are too heavy to be broken.

33
00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:12.480
Buffet has spoken regularly about the importance of developing healthy and

34
00:02:12.481 --> 00:02:16.170
positive habits early on in life because the longer they persist,

35
00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:17.760
the harder they are to break.

36
00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:21.450
We may not notice how bad smoking is until we have to quit,

37
00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:23.880
at which point it's significantly harder.

38
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.200
We may not understand how important it is to exercise until we suffer from a

39
00:02:28.201 --> 00:02:32.400
lack of it.
We may not understand the value of money until we have very little,

40
00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:37.110
et cetera.
It's important to introspect and and plan your life now,

41
00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:40.680
not later.
Number five,
in the business world,

42
00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:44.070
the rear view mirror is always clearer than the windshield.

43
00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:49.880
This is obviously above its own way of saying hindsight is 2020 we don't exactly

44
00:02:50.071 --> 00:02:53.880
know what the future may hold.
However,
despite the risk of failure,

45
00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:57.870
we still have to keep moving forward and not focus on what is behind us.

46
00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.810
Number four,
should you find yourself in a chronically leaking vote.

47
00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:06.640
Energy devoted to changing vessels is likely to be more productive than energy

48
00:03:06.641 --> 00:03:11.410
devoted to patching leaks.
This is important not only in business and investing,

49
00:03:11.411 --> 00:03:13.210
but in life in general.
Now,

50
00:03:13.211 --> 00:03:15.940
buffet isn't saying you should give up when things go wrong.

51
00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:18.970
Maybe that's the case with investing in the stock market,

52
00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:21.610
but when things are going terribly wrong,

53
00:03:21.611 --> 00:03:26.200
sometimes it is better in life to get up from it and try something new or move

54
00:03:26.201 --> 00:03:29.230
on to a new focus or a new ship.
Number three,

55
00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:32.260
if you get to my age in life and nobody thinks well of you,

56
00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:36.190
I don't care how big your bank account is,
your life is a disaster.

57
00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:40.720
Perhaps this is easy to say if you're sitting on billions of dollars,

58
00:03:40.721 --> 00:03:44.890
but regardless,
despite everything buffet has achieved in his life,

59
00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:48.250
he still believes that in the end it is not material wealth,

60
00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:52.690
but the depth of your relationships with others that counts and gives meaning to

61
00:03:52.691 --> 00:03:57.550
your life.
Number two,
the best thing I did was to choose the right heroes.

62
00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:01.030
While we shouldn't try to live our lives like other people,

63
00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:05.530
searching for inspiration and heroes is completely normal and according to

64
00:04:05.531 --> 00:04:06.970
buffet,
a great idea.

65
00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:10.780
If you're going for something great heating the wisdom of others who have done

66
00:04:10.781 --> 00:04:15.520
great things with for you is always a wise move.
Number one.
Rule number one,

67
00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:20.650
never lose money.
Rule number two,
never forget.
Rule number one,
this,

68
00:04:20.651 --> 00:04:22.870
as you can see in buckets,
own words,

69
00:04:22.871 --> 00:04:26.980
is rule number one when dealing with investment and business in general,

70
00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:29.980
and that quote is about as straightforward as it gets.

71
00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:32.980
These were some of Buffett's highlighted quotes.
However,

72
00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:36.910
he of course has much more to say and I encourage you to look more into them.

73
00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:40.600
