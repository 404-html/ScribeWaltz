Hello and welcome to a combined effort by fire of learning and Mr Z to ask who

2
00:00:06.181 --> 00:00:10.800
were the Celts,
what is their fascinating history and most of all,

3
00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.900
what if their history had changed and the Celtic nation state had emerged in

4
00:00:15.901 --> 00:00:19.110
ancient times?
This is part two of that video,

5
00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:20.800
so be sure to head over to this series,

6
00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:24.510
these channel to see part one the link to which will be in the description.

7
00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.300
However,
if you have seen that video,
let's continue.

8
00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:30.120
By the second century BC,

9
00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:33.870
Rome had control over the Italian peninsula and was expanding around the

10
00:00:33.871 --> 00:00:34.680
Mediterranean,

11
00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.850
which inevitably brought them into closer contact and conflict with the counts

12
00:00:38.851 --> 00:00:41.190
in southern France and northern Spain.

13
00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.780
The Celts of Spain are more forgotten branch though archaeology and research

14
00:00:45.781 --> 00:00:49.860
reveals a stronger presence and expected in places such as a studious and

15
00:00:49.861 --> 00:00:53.720
Galicia,
the ladder region having been named after the [inaudible] tribe,

16
00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.720
which as you may expect is related to the word call the Celts.

17
00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:01.320
A variance would be among the first to fall to the Romans.
Apart from,
of course,

18
00:01:01.321 --> 00:01:06.000
the Celts that were living in northern Italy as wrong controlled much of the

19
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.380
Iberian Peninsula by one 30 BC.
As time went on,
Roman power fuel,

20
00:01:10.381 --> 00:01:13.680
that's continued expansion ever farther,
even into Lens,

21
00:01:13.681 --> 00:01:15.600
which were mysterious and unknown.

22
00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.400
The Roman who would move the empire is in northward into a terra incognita in

23
00:01:20.401 --> 00:01:20.641
deal,

24
00:01:20.641 --> 00:01:25.500
a huge blow to the Celts was none other than Julius Caesar from his stronghold

25
00:01:25.501 --> 00:01:27.420
in northern Italy and southern France.

26
00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.770
He moved to subdue Gaul and added it to the domains of the Roman republic.

27
00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:34.980
At this time now,
the first century BC,

28
00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:37.740
Rome could boast to be the greatest power in the world.

29
00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:40.590
Though even people's it regarded as barbarians,

30
00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:45.650
such as the Germans and Celts remained legitimate threats Cesar may have from

31
00:01:46.141 --> 00:01:50.100
time to time exaggerated this threat to justify his expansion.

32
00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:54.720
But many historians do agree that the Celts of gall could have challenged and

33
00:01:54.721 --> 00:01:57.120
even potentially defeated Rome.

34
00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:02.450
Caesar's gallic wars began in 58 BC and largely oh to Caesar's leadership

35
00:02:02.581 --> 00:02:03.150
abilities.

36
00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:07.590
He was able to defeat them as Caesars of do the whole area of what is now modern

37
00:02:07.591 --> 00:02:08.640
day France.
However,

38
00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:13.350
a Celtic leader named verse and get Eric's emerged to unite the tribes of gall

39
00:02:13.351 --> 00:02:17.730
and expel the invaders.
He could very well have been successful.
However,

40
00:02:17.731 --> 00:02:21.840
the gallic lack of unity and their tactical and effectiveness against the Roman

41
00:02:21.841 --> 00:02:26.630
army would be their downfall and Caesar's victory was inevitable.

42
00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:29.850
Following the battle of Alisia and 52 BC,

43
00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:35.060
1 million kilts had died in this conflict and another million had been enslaved.

44
00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:38.280
Rowan would expand further into Celtic territory.

45
00:02:38.281 --> 00:02:43.230
As time went on a century or so later in 43 and Britain was invaded.

46
00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:47.490
It is here again that we see many Celts join forces this time around the you're

47
00:02:47.491 --> 00:02:52.110
60 and under the warrior Queen [inaudible] and that is here again that they were

48
00:02:52.111 --> 00:02:55.230
almost victorious,
but in the final moments of the war,

49
00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:59.380
Boca was killed and the Romans reverse the course of events and ended up

50
00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:01.060
conquering much of the island,

51
00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:04.390
the only heavily Celtic areas outside of the Roman Empire.

52
00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:09.130
Now we're Scotland and Ireland with some tribes mixed into what the Romans

53
00:03:09.131 --> 00:03:13.420
called Gare Manea criminy Celtic culture did not disappear.
However,

54
00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:15.580
even under Roman occupation,
in fact,

55
00:03:15.581 --> 00:03:19.330
in some areas as a mixed Romano Celtic culture,
he merged.

56
00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:22.150
A good indicator of this is language.

57
00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:26.950
There was cross influence in Rome's new provinces and we still today see romance

58
00:03:26.951 --> 00:03:27.670
languages,

59
00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:31.930
children of the Latin language like French and Galician with a little bit of

60
00:03:31.931 --> 00:03:36.220
Celtic influence and Celtic languages with Latin influence such as well.

61
00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:37.471
<v 1>And this timeline,</v>

62
00:03:37.471 --> 00:03:40.950
Rome's focus had shifted from northward expansion to dominance of the south.

63
00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:42.990
As far as the Roman populace was concerned,

64
00:03:42.991 --> 00:03:45.450
the Celtic and federation was already Roman land,

65
00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:49.200
so it only made sense to expand to lands that they didn't hold them in,

66
00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:52.230
specifically for the up and coming Julius Caesar,

67
00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:55.230
he would develop an admiration of Alexander the Great.

68
00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:58.560
And upon encountering he statue of Alexander during one of his tours,

69
00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:03.030
he would realize that at the age of 31 he was now at the age at which Alexander

70
00:04:03.031 --> 00:04:06.570
had nearly conquered the known world.
And as an our timeline of wood shake,

71
00:04:06.571 --> 00:04:08.850
something within him that would motivate out of the young Caesar,

72
00:04:08.851 --> 00:04:13.470
a desire for conquest of Asia to Bush deep into the east,

73
00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:15.780
topple the Parthian empire and spread.

74
00:04:15.781 --> 00:04:19.590
Roman reached to the peaks of India and with Roman strength now strategically

75
00:04:19.591 --> 00:04:23.460
concentrated down the African east coast as well as across the Mediterranean.

76
00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:28.200
So did the opportunity present itself and naval raid and conquest of Southern

77
00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:31.770
Arabia to establish a launch off point for see invasion of India and Persia

78
00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:35.690
while land forces drawing upon Celtic recruits spearheaded and depart the end

79
00:04:35.691 --> 00:04:39.270
lands,
the Celts becoming a force capable of fending off dramatic invasion,

80
00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:43.440
serve as a buffer to protect room from barbarian invasion and the faulty

81
00:04:43.441 --> 00:04:46.530
recruitment of dramatic soldiers who would ultimately turn on them.

82
00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:50.100
Though this couldn't stop the same mistakes from being made in the eastern

83
00:04:50.101 --> 00:04:52.160
campaigns by Julius Caesar as go,

84
00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:55.410
Alysia becomes increasingly more independent from the Roman Empire.

85
00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:58.560
So did the Roman government become increasingly concerned about the potential

86
00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:00.300
threat the Celtic state may pose,

87
00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:03.480
thus triggering a poorly orchestrate invasion of Galicia.

88
00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:06.240
While Roman efforts were focused on the east,

89
00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:09.990
this Roman defeat would set the tone for the next century of the client for the

90
00:05:09.991 --> 00:05:13.450
empire North African lands would start fracturing away,

91
00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:17.760
breaking off to be claimed by inland groups which Roman resources were exhausted

92
00:05:17.761 --> 00:05:21.810
on Caesar's campaigns would have made him quite popular to some as he had

93
00:05:21.811 --> 00:05:24.510
extended Roman influence further and further into Asia,

94
00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:28.140
but back home it was becoming increasingly evident that these wars in the east

95
00:05:28.141 --> 00:05:31.470
were siphoning away necessary resources and manpower that were needed

96
00:05:31.471 --> 00:05:32.304
domestically.

97
00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:36.630
Caesar's men would be cut off and left to their own devices without food,
water,

98
00:05:36.631 --> 00:05:37.464
and gold.

99
00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:41.550
The men would mute me under general and assassinate him leading eastern Roman

100
00:05:41.551 --> 00:05:43.350
spoils to fracture as well.

101
00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:47.640
Romans government would face increasing instability and even facing invasion by

102
00:05:47.641 --> 00:05:49.740
the Celts and retaliation for rooms.

103
00:05:49.741 --> 00:05:54.240
Attempts to subdue them ultimately leading the Roman Empire to crumble and take

104
00:05:54.241 --> 00:05:56.780
on the new form in the following decades as the ACC,

105
00:05:56.781 --> 00:06:01.310
Ian or a she and empire comprised of Greece,
the Balkans parts of Italy,

106
00:06:01.311 --> 00:06:06.110
Anatolia and the North East African coast with some few scattered ports about

107
00:06:06.111 --> 00:06:07.560
Europe,
Africa,
and Asia.

108
00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:11.050
<v 0>When the Roman Empire fell centuries later,</v>

109
00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:15.400
the power vacuum that was left was filled primarily by dramatic tribes like the

110
00:06:15.401 --> 00:06:17.500
angles,
Saxons,
and francs,

111
00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:21.130
which is partly why Celtic culture and society didn't make as much of a

112
00:06:21.131 --> 00:06:23.200
resurgence in the post.
The Roman world,

113
00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:27.740
the Romano Celts who were living in galled were assimilated into Frankish

114
00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:32.110
society and became the French.
The only exception to this is Brittany,

115
00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:34.540
which retains its Celtic heritage today,

116
00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:38.230
although the bretons are not descendants of the original French calls,

117
00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:42.040
they are descendants of British Coutts who migrated to the region later on.

118
00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:46.660
Famous taken over by the dramatic Visigoths and sweaty peoples in England.

119
00:06:46.661 --> 00:06:50.800
A similar process occurred when the Romano Britain's were overtaken by the

120
00:06:50.801 --> 00:06:52.450
dramatic Anglo Saxons.

121
00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:56.800
Though many coats flood westward to form the Modern Nation of Wales and the

122
00:06:56.801 --> 00:06:59.440
territory of Cornwall,
and as I said,

123
00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:02.890
migrated to France and one later become the territory of Brittany.

124
00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:06.700
Each of these places tracing their heritage back to their Celtic Britain,

125
00:07:06.730 --> 00:07:08.800
heritage Scotland,
Ireland,

126
00:07:08.801 --> 00:07:13.030
and the Isle of Man who had effectively retained independence later joined

127
00:07:13.031 --> 00:07:17.260
whales,
Brittany and Cornwall to become the six Celtic nations of the modern day.

128
00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:22.030
Although some would include Galicia and the studios in Spain making it arguably

129
00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:24.610
eight Celtic nations for much of history.

130
00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:28.360
There are Celtic identity was suppressed or at times even lost.

131
00:07:28.510 --> 00:07:30.580
It would not completely disappear however,

132
00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:34.870
and there were independent Celtic nations for much of European history.

133
00:07:35.050 --> 00:07:39.820
However,
in the 16th and 17th centuries,
Brittany was absorbed into France.
I,

134
00:07:39.821 --> 00:07:43.120
Berrien county culture had already been absorbed in the fighting between the

135
00:07:43.121 --> 00:07:44.110
Germanic tribes,

136
00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:47.980
the invading Muslims and the other ethnic groups of Spain and the other Celtic

137
00:07:47.981 --> 00:07:51.700
nations came under the rule of the English crown becoming Britain.

138
00:07:51.910 --> 00:07:56.500
Yet Celtic identity and heritage would begin a resurgence in the 18th century or

139
00:07:56.501 --> 00:07:58.330
so.
And in a modern day,

140
00:07:58.331 --> 00:08:02.980
their identity is in some ways perhaps the strongest.
It's been in centuries.

141
00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:05.140
Yet in other ways,
it may be the weakest,

142
00:08:05.470 --> 00:08:09.610
the only truly independent Celtic nation is the Republic of Ireland.

143
00:08:09.670 --> 00:08:13.540
And where are the six Celtic nations themselves have today in estimated

144
00:08:13.541 --> 00:08:16.660
collective population of around 20 million people.

145
00:08:16.750 --> 00:08:19.960
Only around 1 million can speak at Celtic language fluently.

146
00:08:20.140 --> 00:08:24.100
Although there are accounts living in north and South America and Oceania who

147
00:08:24.101 --> 00:08:25.750
can speak the languages as well.

148
00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:29.830
Most of the other accounts such as those native to Spain or those who immigrated

149
00:08:29.831 --> 00:08:33.310
to the United States do not retain a linguistic heritage.

150
00:08:33.370 --> 00:08:34.990
Only being ethnically Caltech,

151
00:08:35.290 --> 00:08:39.220
ancient Celtic history was changed by a few decisive moments.

152
00:08:39.250 --> 00:08:41.320
But if any of those moments had gone differently,

153
00:08:41.560 --> 00:08:44.260
things could have been drastically altered.
Okay.

154
00:08:46.370 --> 00:08:46.521
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

155
00:08:46.521 --> 00:08:49.610
I think the Germanic tribes would be a good place to start looking because of

156
00:08:49.611 --> 00:08:51.410
the effect that had on the later Roman empire.

157
00:08:51.411 --> 00:08:55.140
You have to wonder if it has a similar effect on the Celtic nation if they to

158
00:08:55.141 --> 00:08:57.990
start migrating and pushing against the boundaries and then,

159
00:08:58.450 --> 00:09:02.900
<v 3>yeah,
precisely.
The Celts would have ancestral animosity toward the,
uh,</v>

160
00:09:03.030 --> 00:09:05.860
towards the Germanic tribes because they were the ones primarily feuding than

161
00:09:05.861 --> 00:09:06.850
they would have been pushed out.

162
00:09:07.060 --> 00:09:10.120
They're able to fend them off in this timeline and develop more of a rivalry

163
00:09:10.121 --> 00:09:13.750
with them.
The question is what the dramatic tribes advanced a little faster,
uh,

164
00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:17.830
and what the dramatic tribes pose as much of a threat to Galicia as they had to

165
00:09:17.831 --> 00:09:18.370
Rome.

166
00:09:18.370 --> 00:09:22.220
<v 1>Oh,
I could see them like mimicking the couch because that was similar to tribal</v>

167
00:09:22.221 --> 00:09:25.790
structure.
There you go about unifying their own type of country in the same way.

168
00:09:25.791 --> 00:09:26.624
The Celts side,

169
00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:29.630
<v 3>right?
They wouldn't have the benefits that Rome had given the Celts,</v>

170
00:09:29.690 --> 00:09:33.520
but you could certainly see them observing and copying as well as you.

171
00:09:33.610 --> 00:09:36.320
You might have some desserts from the Celtic state going over there and trying

172
00:09:36.321 --> 00:09:38.090
to organize something themselves.
Uh,

173
00:09:38.091 --> 00:09:42.690
not to mention Roman soldiers who would be in that region when Rome fell and,
or,

174
00:09:42.830 --> 00:09:47.500
uh,
again,
a dessert is from the Roman army who moved up that way.
This timeline,

175
00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:51.590
Galicia invades northern Rome and captures portions of it in retaliation.

176
00:09:51.591 --> 00:09:54.080
So some northern Romans could have fled into the dramatic,

177
00:09:54.081 --> 00:09:59.081
a dramatic region and attempted to unify it to create a new rival state to the

178
00:09:59.421 --> 00:10:00.140
Celts.

179
00:10:00.140 --> 00:10:05.060
It could be something of a Rome 2.0 but built with dramatic stuck or it could

180
00:10:05.061 --> 00:10:06.460
just be an independent,
uh,

181
00:10:06.490 --> 00:10:10.700
dramatic state that forms out of a purely without Roman influence.

182
00:10:11.060 --> 00:10:12.800
Which ones you think is more likely because again,

183
00:10:12.801 --> 00:10:15.890
you do have the deserters from,
uh,
from the eastern Roman Empire and,

184
00:10:15.940 --> 00:10:17.760
and you have the Romans who would flee from,
uh,

185
00:10:17.930 --> 00:10:20.090
northern Rome when Felicia invaded

186
00:10:20.390 --> 00:10:24.310
<v 1>like us.
Germany in the time was more cutoff from interaction and Roman,</v>

187
00:10:24.311 --> 00:10:26.350
I guess what would be the coalition empire here?

188
00:10:26.351 --> 00:10:28.090
So probably something that would be more

189
00:10:28.380 --> 00:10:29.830
<v 3>independent.
Yeah.
Yeah.</v>

190
00:10:29.950 --> 00:10:33.280
You also got to consider that they don't want be far less Roman influence there

191
00:10:33.281 --> 00:10:35.380
and thus they would speak different languages.

192
00:10:35.650 --> 00:10:38.560
Communication would just be near impossible between these two.

193
00:10:38.770 --> 00:10:43.090
So through limitations and dramatic tribes try to create a state mimicking the

194
00:10:43.091 --> 00:10:45.940
Celts.
Now,
historically,
the,
uh,
the,

195
00:10:46.290 --> 00:10:48.110
the Germans were able to far out compete the Celts.

196
00:10:48.170 --> 00:10:51.550
Cesar seem to have some concerns that the Celts will pose a greater threat to

197
00:10:51.551 --> 00:10:53.290
Rome's future.
Then the Germans did.

198
00:10:53.500 --> 00:10:54.790
<v 1>Well,
can you expand on that a little bit?</v>

199
00:10:55.020 --> 00:10:57.520
Is that pretty much goes back to the fourth century BC.

200
00:10:57.850 --> 00:10:59.650
When the cows were active in the call,

201
00:10:59.651 --> 00:11:03.720
was very active in northern Italy in second city of room.
Uh,

202
00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:07.450
they were closer to Rome.
They had more interactions with them.

203
00:11:07.451 --> 00:11:11.260
They were at times,
some of the tribes were friends with the Carthaginians saw.

204
00:11:11.261 --> 00:11:12.720
There was kind of a big word,

205
00:11:12.730 --> 00:11:15.310
more of a threat to Romy because of proximity and past history.

206
00:11:15.311 --> 00:11:18.520
But there is also a vendetta,
I guess a sense of getting revenge,
right?

207
00:11:18.570 --> 00:11:20.030
There's not necessarily a,
a,

208
00:11:20.031 --> 00:11:24.000
a tactical or technological superiority of the Celts over the dramatic tribes.

209
00:11:24.180 --> 00:11:24.760
Right?

210
00:11:24.760 --> 00:11:25.031
<v 3>Those,</v>

211
00:11:25.031 --> 00:11:27.790
the Germans out competing the Celts might be indicative that the Germans had the

212
00:11:27.791 --> 00:11:29.380
tactical and technological superiority.

213
00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:34.700
<v 1>Can we see something,
perhaps a kin to France and,
uh,
pressures,
rivalry,</v>

214
00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:36.000
uh,
arise between

215
00:11:36.050 --> 00:11:38.210
<v 3>Galicia and the new dramatic state.</v>

216
00:11:38.750 --> 00:11:42.160
Whereas Germany just rapidly meant manages to modernize and melts,

217
00:11:42.161 --> 00:11:46.550
rise then come back to Galicia and sort of drive them,
drive them westward.

218
00:11:46.760 --> 00:11:47.593
I can see that

219
00:11:48.030 --> 00:11:48.760
<v 1>the geography,</v>

220
00:11:48.760 --> 00:11:52.030
like the Rhine river cause creates a natural boundary that's hard to cross and

221
00:11:52.031 --> 00:11:53.740
lays a foundation for two to rise.

222
00:11:54.140 --> 00:11:57.190
<v 3>Right.
And you think the Rhine River would be a good spot to just set the border</v>

223
00:11:57.191 --> 00:11:59.590
between the two?
Yeah,
I could see out over time

224
00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:04.010
<v 1>Germans kind of pushed the Celtic nation back over the Rhine river and from</v>

225
00:12:04.011 --> 00:12:05.540
their separate nation states would arise.

226
00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:08.130
<v 3>What about the eastern border?
So we established the western border,</v>

227
00:12:08.131 --> 00:12:10.110
but now we also got to consider that the Slavs or uh,

228
00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:12.150
the Slavs are still in that region.
The Germans,

229
00:12:12.151 --> 00:12:15.360
because the kelsies had repelled them and push them more eastward,

230
00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:17.310
had intermingled with the Slavs a little more,

231
00:12:17.311 --> 00:12:20.240
but they perhaps in the form of better relations or perhaps they've developed a

232
00:12:20.250 --> 00:12:21.083
rivalry,

233
00:12:21.210 --> 00:12:24.720
but you do have them there and eventually you're going to have the huns and the

234
00:12:24.721 --> 00:12:27.290
Mongols flooding in and thus the slabs games

235
00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:29.740
<v 1>get pushed westward even more.
Yeah,</v>

236
00:12:29.741 --> 00:12:32.410
I could see that creating a lot of tension in the whole area of Europe.

237
00:12:32.920 --> 00:12:36.280
I don't know if that would lead to the Slavs mimicking the nation state.

238
00:12:36.281 --> 00:12:37.810
Like the Kelton,
maybe the Germans would,

239
00:12:37.811 --> 00:12:41.080
but I was thinking that the Slavic invasions that happened in the seventh

240
00:12:41.090 --> 00:12:43.330
century,
so than the hands,
and then later on the Mongols,

241
00:12:43.331 --> 00:12:46.630
we've got a lot of pressure on the,
uh,
the coalition state,
right?

242
00:12:46.860 --> 00:12:48.540
<v 3>Let's see it as sort of protected because again,</v>

243
00:12:48.541 --> 00:12:51.840
you have the dramatic tribes and below that you have the alternate Byzantine

244
00:12:51.840 --> 00:12:54.310
Empire,
which is screen something of a block cake.

245
00:12:54.330 --> 00:12:57.240
Alyssia is safely nestled away in western Europe.

246
00:12:57.600 --> 00:13:01.050
The issue that could be posed in the future would be that of the Mayan
Caliphate,

247
00:13:01.051 --> 00:13:03.750
which in this timeline probably wouldn't exist because Islam is far weaker,

248
00:13:03.751 --> 00:13:07.800
just doesn't exist.
You might also see,
no,

249
00:13:07.801 --> 00:13:12.750
not even that the Mongol hordes would most likely be stopped by Germany and the

250
00:13:12.751 --> 00:13:15.180
alternate Byzantine Empire.
And that would really be,

251
00:13:15.181 --> 00:13:17.550
they have a buffer that Galicia is very well protected.

252
00:13:17.730 --> 00:13:18.840
And that might actually be a,

253
00:13:18.841 --> 00:13:22.350
a bit of a downfall for the Celts because the Celts,

254
00:13:22.410 --> 00:13:24.270
Vito only needs to face those two threats.

255
00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:27.630
Those two threats would be faced up against all the on slot that's gonna be

256
00:13:27.631 --> 00:13:29.010
going on in central Europe.
And Central,

257
00:13:29.011 --> 00:13:31.440
you're going to become a real battle ground and thus will need to adapt to that

258
00:13:31.710 --> 00:13:33.510
cause the Celts aren't facing any hardship.

259
00:13:33.540 --> 00:13:37.590
They might begin to slack a little bit and become a little softer for something

260
00:13:37.591 --> 00:13:42.390
which could prime them for a re conquest by the Byzantine Empire to re more of

261
00:13:42.391 --> 00:13:45.060
the 10 Italian peninsula or maybe a,

262
00:13:45.061 --> 00:13:48.520
the dramatic tribes pushing further westward.
Like I say that,

263
00:13:48.820 --> 00:13:53.070
what do you see the,
uh,
the vikings to the vikings pushing into Ireland,

264
00:13:53.071 --> 00:13:57.450
but Ireland and Scotland.
But just as in our timeline,
we,

265
00:13:57.451 --> 00:13:59.510
they'd probably be repelled even more senescence.

266
00:13:59.550 --> 00:14:02.760
They're more prepared and the matter of the dramatic state,

267
00:14:02.761 --> 00:14:05.490
it would likely be something that came to the holy Roman Empire word be a bunch

268
00:14:05.491 --> 00:14:06.390
of disunified.

269
00:14:06.420 --> 00:14:11.220
It'd be a bunch of fairly autonomous tribes with maybe a hiking ruling them,

270
00:14:12.330 --> 00:14:16.830
much like the confederation.
It's eight is a confederation of tribes.
Yeah.

271
00:14:16.831 --> 00:14:18.090
Just looking at the map,
you can seek a list.

272
00:14:18.091 --> 00:14:20.940
He has a very well protected by the Germanic tribes.
Uh,

273
00:14:20.941 --> 00:14:25.860
we could see a primary dramatic nation forming along the borders of Galicia,

274
00:14:26.100 --> 00:14:30.870
just out of necessity to repel any advancement by the Celts and combat them.

275
00:14:30.900 --> 00:14:34.300
So they'll just unify out and think of unified in necessity.
Again with,
uh,

276
00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:36.750
with Galicia it's,
it's very well nestled away.

277
00:14:36.751 --> 00:14:41.751
Its main competitors will likely be the Akkadian Empire and Germanic tribes row

278
00:14:42.330 --> 00:14:46.560
and at that might soften it up,
but there's the expansion of Galicia.

279
00:14:46.770 --> 00:14:49.940
If Germany,
if the Germanic tribes managed to unify into a state,

280
00:14:49.990 --> 00:14:53.450
they would like to be able to hold off,
um,
at the Rhine river.

281
00:14:53.930 --> 00:14:57.680
So when that perhaps would that opened the door for Galicia to expand into the

282
00:14:57.681 --> 00:15:00.410
new world,
into Greenland or maybe North Africa,

283
00:15:03.710 --> 00:15:04.543
<v 1>ah,</v>

284
00:15:05.520 --> 00:15:09.840
<v 3>glitzy as occupying all the major,
a colonial powers,
oh,
at least their territory.</v>

285
00:15:09.841 --> 00:15:12.150
And it's just a wide open a stretch for it.

286
00:15:12.630 --> 00:15:17.600
It could go from Iberia and expand into South America.
They can go from,
uh,

287
00:15:17.820 --> 00:15:21.720
directly from the British isles and expanded northward into Greenland or Canada

288
00:15:21.990 --> 00:15:26.430
or from France.
It should be a fairly straight shoot to mid Canada or the US.

289
00:15:26.690 --> 00:15:30.480
<v 1>I can see that happening in later years.
I was the,
uh,
the nation stays in tact</v>

290
00:15:32.150 --> 00:15:34.790
and this time I was talking to them.
The worst.
I'm in the,
uh,

291
00:15:35.660 --> 00:15:37.130
we're gaining the upper hand.
I'm a necessity.

292
00:15:37.400 --> 00:15:37.630
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

293
00:15:37.630 --> 00:15:40.540
<v 1>Neighborly and still spending extending into Iceland and Greenland and on their</v>

294
00:15:40.541 --> 00:15:44.220
own.
But I can see them going into North Africa and stop talking.

295
00:15:44.221 --> 00:15:46.650
Like there's that incentive by owning Hispana.

296
00:15:47.100 --> 00:15:49.740
<v 3>We might not see Slavic expansion to the Balkans.
However,</v>

297
00:15:50.100 --> 00:15:53.250
that might remain a reco Roman in culture.

298
00:15:53.450 --> 00:15:55.560
Do you think the state structure in Europe would be,

299
00:15:55.561 --> 00:15:59.010
because clearly Galicia is something of a superstate,
it's an empire,

300
00:15:59.011 --> 00:15:59.844
much like Rome,

301
00:15:59.880 --> 00:16:02.760
but how long would go with CLS as an empire and what lands do you believe would

302
00:16:02.761 --> 00:16:03.594
retain?

303
00:16:03.680 --> 00:16:07.450
<v 1>I could see a fragmenting a lot more as it deals with the stresses of the Norse</v>

304
00:16:07.570 --> 00:16:12.410
and the Germans and maybe a mag terrorism,
maybe it African youth invader.

305
00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:14.570
<v 3>The Celts Iberians themselves might,</v>

306
00:16:14.700 --> 00:16:17.750
might feel distinct enough to create their own country and thus Iberia could

307
00:16:17.751 --> 00:16:20.130
break off that northern portion of a,

308
00:16:20.131 --> 00:16:23.310
of the Italian peninsula might still consider itself Roman and revolts could

309
00:16:23.311 --> 00:16:27.870
lead that to break off as well as Corsican Sardinia,
no,
I can see France and uh,

310
00:16:28.020 --> 00:16:32.280
the British isles being retained as well as most of,
uh,
most of 'em.

311
00:16:32.610 --> 00:16:36.500
What would be Switzerland in Austria since those,
since Switzerland is mostly,

312
00:16:36.501 --> 00:16:38.100
yeah,
the Alps and you couldn't imagine,

313
00:16:38.101 --> 00:16:42.000
I wouldn't imagine many people moving in there to invade a,
we could see,

314
00:16:42.001 --> 00:16:45.660
I could see the German tribes easily fragmenting and then reforming it to a few,

315
00:16:45.661 --> 00:16:48.120
a few different times in two different states.

316
00:16:49.140 --> 00:16:53.130
And the acne and empire might be able to create a greater Greece.

317
00:16:53.160 --> 00:16:57.050
I could see the Greek and Anatolian portions of the and empire,
uh,

318
00:16:57.060 --> 00:17:01.050
remaining a state.
No,
I feel that the Italian portion of it might be break off.

319
00:17:02.060 --> 00:17:06.690
This might,
uh,
that might,
um,
might or may not include Cecily.

320
00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:10.830
CECILY could be more influenced by the Afghan empire and become a portion of it.

321
00:17:11.250 --> 00:17:11.851
But the Italian,
yeah.

322
00:17:11.851 --> 00:17:14.460
Peninsula itself would likely break off and become its own independent state.

323
00:17:15.210 --> 00:17:17.070
And,
uh,
the Parthian Empire,

324
00:17:17.700 --> 00:17:22.110
I could see it holding a good dominion over much of much ancestral Persian land,

325
00:17:23.010 --> 00:17:28.010
but I not sure it would be able to retain a hefty hold over landholdings in

326
00:17:28.890 --> 00:17:29.790
southern Arabia.

327
00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:30.430
<v 1>He'll remind me.</v>

328
00:17:30.430 --> 00:17:35.250
I was going to mention the Aki and empire here doesn't look as much like Rome as

329
00:17:35.251 --> 00:17:37.320
the Roman Empire looks more like a,
a Greek empire,

330
00:17:37.330 --> 00:17:39.930
a middleweight what controls Italy.
Definitely see Roman,

331
00:17:40.740 --> 00:17:43.280
the rest of the Greek islands kind of splitting.
Right.

332
00:17:43.680 --> 00:17:46.770
<v 3>Overall,
I think that's a,
a pretty solid scenario.
I'm glad.</v>

333
00:17:47.220 --> 00:17:49.170
I'm glad we worked together and I liked the way the whole thing came together.

334
00:17:49.570 --> 00:17:49.940
<v 4>Yeah,</v>

335
00:17:49.940 --> 00:17:53.350
<v 3>absolutely.
