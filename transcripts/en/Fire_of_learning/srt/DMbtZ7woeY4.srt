00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:03,300
Hello and welcome to fire of learning.
In the last video,

2
00:00:03,301 --> 00:00:05,430
we ended with the end of the civil war.

3
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:10,020
The period following the civil war is
often called the reconstruction era,

4
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:14,220
referring as you might expect to the
reconstruction of the union following it's

5
00:00:14,221 --> 00:00:19,080
divide while the south was
being reintegrated into
the nation and rebuilt the

6
00:00:19,081 --> 00:00:22,980
north and the West would take off and
industry commerce and technological

7
00:00:22,981 --> 00:00:26,660
development, transcontinental
railroads enabled quicker passage,

8
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:28,170
the western parts of the nation.

9
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:31,620
It once took six months to
reach California from New York.

10
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:35,850
Now it took only a week as settlers
moved into the west. However,

11
00:00:35,851 --> 00:00:39,690
they encroached further on native
American territory leading to considerable

12
00:00:39,691 --> 00:00:40,950
amounts of conflict with them,

13
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:45,210
which would last until the 1890s many
natives who were not killed and resistance

14
00:00:45,211 --> 00:00:48,930
replaced on reservations and some
attempts to integrate them were made.

15
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,530
Many people will be employed as well and
the industries that would rule the east

16
00:00:52,531 --> 00:00:56,190
of the nation and turn the United States
into the greatest industrial power in

17
00:00:56,191 --> 00:00:57,024
the world.

18
00:00:57,330 --> 00:01:01,620
This age would be the rise of corporations
in America and many at the time felt

19
00:01:01,621 --> 00:01:04,680
that corporations were interfering
with the nation's down to Earth,

20
00:01:04,681 --> 00:01:05,730
democratic nature.

21
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:09,870
What was seen as corruption on the part
of the corporations would lead to labor

22
00:01:09,871 --> 00:01:14,871
organizations and unions such as in
Knights of labor in 1869 strikes and

23
00:01:15,151 --> 00:01:18,990
protests would grow more frequent and
such movements would help characterize the

24
00:01:18,991 --> 00:01:23,970
age as well as factories, corporations
and centers of industry, schools,

25
00:01:23,971 --> 00:01:25,050
hospitals,
museums,

26
00:01:25,051 --> 00:01:28,560
and centers of art and culture in such
things would pop up across the nation.

27
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:32,550
Science would also prosper here with
scientists such as Nikola Tesla,

28
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:37,580
Alexander Graham Bell and Thomas Edison
Active Alaska will be purchased in 1867

29
00:01:38,701 --> 00:01:42,600
in a purchase remarked as Seward's folly,
famous American author,

30
00:01:42,601 --> 00:01:46,770
Mark Twain would coined a term for
the 1870s to the early 20th century.

31
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:51,060
The gilded age as a typical name
representing social upheaval with a silver

32
00:01:51,061 --> 00:01:51,730
lining.

33
00:01:51,730 --> 00:01:55,290
Both the industries in the east and
expansion westward would be undertaking my

34
00:01:55,291 --> 00:01:57,690
huge numbers of immigrants
pouring into the country.

35
00:01:57,930 --> 00:01:59,910
According to the US Census Bureau,

36
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:02,250
from the end of the civil war
to the start of World War,

37
00:02:02,251 --> 00:02:06,330
one 28 million immigrants would pour
into the nation, almost all from Europe,

38
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:09,960
some from British Canada, Quebec,
and some from Asia as well.

39
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:13,530
Though Asians were typically more
unwelcomed than other European groups.

40
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:17,280
In 1880 the population of
the u s had 50 million.

41
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:20,940
As Jim crow laws began reversing
their rights of blacks in the south.

42
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,330
The women's suffrage movement would
rise up in this era. During this time,

43
00:02:24,331 --> 00:02:27,600
American foreign policy would
change as well. Prior to this,

44
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:30,240
the United States have been
somewhat isolationists.

45
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:33,870
We see several examples of
what we would call imperialism.

46
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:37,380
The obvious example is the decades
of conquest against native Americans,

47
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:41,460
but also of course the Mexican American
war and the Monroe doctrine and things

48
00:02:41,461 --> 00:02:46,170
of that nature, but now
with the continent, very
much under American control,

49
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,370
American politicians,

50
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:51,690
businessmen and military leaders turn
their sights on the international theater.

51
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:55,050
It's often debated whether
or not America had an empire,

52
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:59,260
mostly because it did an act exactly
similarly to the European empires across

53
00:02:59,261 --> 00:03:02,620
the world, mostly because it had plenty
of opportunity in his home region.

54
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:06,670
But while the word empire is more
contested prior to these decades,

55
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:10,600
if it is applicable at all, which I
encourage you to decide for yourself,

56
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:13,840
it very likely begins here
with a Spanish American war.

57
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:18,670
During the 1870s up through the 1890s
nearby Cuba had been pushing for

58
00:03:18,671 --> 00:03:23,200
independence in an age where an American
Trey expand that across the world.

59
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:27,040
American businessmen pushing to expand
their markets into the region and fueled

60
00:03:27,050 --> 00:03:27,671
newspapers,

61
00:03:27,671 --> 00:03:31,450
highlighting and exaggerating Spanish
atrocities on the island against the

62
00:03:31,451 --> 00:03:32,050
rebels.

63
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:37,050
In 1898 when an American ship in Havana
harbor called the USS Maine exploded,

64
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:40,210
the Spanish army was immediately
blamed in newspapers,

65
00:03:40,211 --> 00:03:41,800
blew up the issue across a nation,

66
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:45,460
though the Spanish were
likely not responsible, this
would force the government,

67
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:48,670
which was somewhat unwilling
into the Spanish American war.

68
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:52,060
During this war which
lasted only three months,

69
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:56,350
Cuba was liberated and the Philippines,
Puerto Rico and Guam were annexed.

70
00:03:56,380 --> 00:03:59,670
The conflict would later break out
between the U S and Philippines and it'll

71
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:04,680
become independent in 1946 also in 1898
Hawaii would be annexed following the

72
00:04:04,961 --> 00:04:06,700
overthrowing of the Hawaiian Queen,

73
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:09,970
the progressive era named
after the progressive movement,

74
00:04:09,971 --> 00:04:14,290
which focused on tackling social labor
and political inequalities arose in the

75
00:04:14,291 --> 00:04:18,850
1890s journalists who
focused on the corruption and
everything from the politics

76
00:04:18,851 --> 00:04:22,210
of the day to the unsanitary
conditions of the meatpacking industry.

77
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:25,660
We're referred to as
muckrakers labor reforms,

78
00:04:25,661 --> 00:04:30,661
increases in sanitation
and social movements would
intensify in a Sarah Spanish

79
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:32,740
American war veteran Theodore Roosevelt,

80
00:04:32,741 --> 00:04:36,550
who had become presidents after the
assassination of William Mckinley became

81
00:04:36,551 --> 00:04:40,960
president in 1901 and would be a leading
progressive president doing things such

82
00:04:40,961 --> 00:04:44,290
as establishing the FDA and
expanding national parks.

83
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:47,230
He would continue an imperialist
foreign policy. However,

84
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:49,240
expanding the power of American military,

85
00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:53,520
focusing on foreign threats and laying
the foundations for the Panama Canal to

86
00:04:53,521 --> 00:04:55,210
be built in 19 no wait,

87
00:04:55,211 --> 00:04:58,780
the Ford model t would be introduced
on the market regarded as the first

88
00:04:58,781 --> 00:05:02,320
affordable car. It would
revolutionize American transportation.

89
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:07,180
In 1912 Arizona will become a state
becoming a final state and the continuous

90
00:05:07,181 --> 00:05:08,080
United States,

91
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:13,470
the main continent had now been
successfully won in 1914 rising political

92
00:05:13,991 --> 00:05:17,710
conflict in Europe would eventually
explode into the first world war.

93
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:19,180
The United States,

94
00:05:19,181 --> 00:05:23,440
while very much affected by the conflict
chose at first to stay out of European

95
00:05:23,441 --> 00:05:24,274
affairs.

96
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:29,200
However much the government and populous
favor of the allied side public opinion

97
00:05:29,201 --> 00:05:31,240
began to shift increasingly toward war.

98
00:05:31,241 --> 00:05:35,590
When German submarines fired on and
sank the Lusitania carrying American

99
00:05:35,591 --> 00:05:39,730
civilian passengers, the German stated
that they would not repeat the incident,

100
00:05:39,731 --> 00:05:43,210
though this eventually proved to not be
true and the Germans fired on any ships

101
00:05:43,211 --> 00:05:46,750
approaching Britain. Later, a
message from the German government,

102
00:05:46,810 --> 00:05:50,350
the Mexican government known as the
Zimmerman telegram and forming the Mexican

103
00:05:50,351 --> 00:05:53,620
government, that if they were to
declare war on the United States,

104
00:05:53,621 --> 00:05:56,860
they will be supported by the Germans
and their reconquest of lands lost during

105
00:05:56,861 --> 00:06:01,580
the war was discovered by the United
States and this mixed with unofficial

106
00:06:01,581 --> 00:06:04,910
German hostility would lead to
American entry into the war.

107
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:09,920
In April of 1917 under president Woodrow
Wilson and truce begin arriving in 1918

108
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:15,890
the United States military
was still rather small and
ill equipped as it had not

109
00:06:15,891 --> 00:06:18,260
been involved in a major
war since the civil war.

110
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:23,330
American industry now turn toward weaponry
and the draft was started while the

111
00:06:23,331 --> 00:06:27,110
war was in its final parts of fresh
American troops in sudden surplus of

112
00:06:27,111 --> 00:06:30,980
supplies and efforts are placed to
withdrawing Russians and help secure the

113
00:06:30,981 --> 00:06:35,810
eventual allied victory.
A year later on November 11th,

114
00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:38,360
1918 the central powers
surrendered to the allied forces.

115
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:42,020
The war would officially be ended
with a treaty of Versailles where the

116
00:06:42,021 --> 00:06:44,240
victorious nations of Britain,
France,

117
00:06:44,241 --> 00:06:48,080
and the United States along with many
other nations negotiated the terms of the

118
00:06:48,081 --> 00:06:51,600
treaty at the palace of Versailles
in France, Germany. However,

119
00:06:51,601 --> 00:06:55,100
it was not included in the negotiations
and would essentially be forced to

120
00:06:55,101 --> 00:06:59,390
accept the terms, namely land loss,
reduction of their military power,

121
00:06:59,391 --> 00:07:04,100
demands of operations, and
assuming responsibility for
the outbreak of the war.

122
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:07,070
Though the war's beginning have
blamed on all sides of Europe.

123
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:08,450
Germany was outrage,

124
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:12,230
but the United States was also a post and
most of these conditions and refuse to

125
00:07:12,231 --> 00:07:13,064
sign the treaty.

126
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:17,060
Wilson's main intentions were to repair
the damage and avoid another war,

127
00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:20,300
namely with things like the
formation of a League of nations,

128
00:07:20,301 --> 00:07:24,110
but Congress would not approve of the
treaty or the entry into the League of

129
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:27,410
nations, which would create tension
for years to come during world war one,

130
00:07:27,411 --> 00:07:30,560
feminism in the United States and
become active again. Generally,

131
00:07:30,561 --> 00:07:34,250
it hadn't felt that if only men could
participate in war is only mentioned vote.

132
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:35,113
However,

133
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:39,170
female efforts at home and overseas a
returned many of these conceptions and in

134
00:07:39,171 --> 00:07:41,930
1919 the 19th amendment was passed,

135
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:44,450
giving women the right to
vote following the war.

136
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:48,860
The United States would return to what
some would call it unilateralism and

137
00:07:48,861 --> 00:07:50,120
others.
As I've said,

138
00:07:50,121 --> 00:07:54,590
isolationism basically
focusing on domestic affairs
and keeping a distance from

139
00:07:54,591 --> 00:07:56,660
foreign conflicts and alliances and such.

140
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:59,150
The economy would grow
from industry and trade,

141
00:07:59,151 --> 00:08:03,710
which is why the 1920s are often called
the roaring twenties some of this

142
00:08:03,711 --> 00:08:08,360
business was illegal. However, as shortly
before the 18th amendment was passed,

143
00:08:08,361 --> 00:08:13,070
which banned the sale and transportation
of alcohol inspired by groups of

144
00:08:13,071 --> 00:08:16,490
Lutheran and seeking to edit things
like alcoholism, family violence,

145
00:08:16,491 --> 00:08:20,600
and other places, society that they felt
alcohol created. Prohibition was gritty,

146
00:08:20,601 --> 00:08:23,720
protested and increased organized
crime throughout the nation.

147
00:08:23,721 --> 00:08:25,310
While decreasing tax revenue,

148
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:30,640
it would not be repealed until 1933
the error also saw a number of social,

149
00:08:30,741 --> 00:08:34,880
cultural and technological reforms.
Jazz music became popular.

150
00:08:34,881 --> 00:08:39,440
Social Roles, namely those of women
began to change. Automobiles, aviation,

151
00:08:39,441 --> 00:08:43,310
the first movies, telephones, radio,
the modern organization of sports.

152
00:08:43,311 --> 00:08:45,950
The media's focus on
unimportant celebrities,

153
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:49,520
many of these kinds of things which
are very much still a part of American

154
00:08:49,521 --> 00:08:53,720
culture and in fact the western culture
have their origins in this time period.

155
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:57,750
The roaring twenties however,
would not last at the end of the decade.

156
00:08:57,751 --> 00:09:01,350
On October 29th,
1929 the stock market crashed.

157
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:05,340
This along with a number of other economic
factors would mark the beginning of

158
00:09:05,341 --> 00:09:07,110
what is called the Great Depression.

159
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:12,210
An era of worldwide increases
in unemployment and poverty
and decreases in GDP

160
00:09:12,211 --> 00:09:14,070
and trade.
In the United States,

161
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:17,370
industrial production
fell 46% wholesale prices,

162
00:09:17,371 --> 00:09:22,371
32% foreign trade is 70% and unemployment
increased 607% or from about 3% of the

163
00:09:24,571 --> 00:09:29,220
population before the depression to 25%
of the population. At the end of it,

164
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:33,120
President Herbert Hoover attempted to
reinvigorate the American economy with

165
00:09:33,121 --> 00:09:34,920
government influence and the economy,

166
00:09:35,310 --> 00:09:37,410
notably the construction
of public buildings,

167
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:40,080
the most famous of which
is the Hoover dam. However,

168
00:09:40,081 --> 00:09:42,000
he would fail and much of his efforts,

169
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:46,590
but in 1932 president Franklin d Roosevelt
was elected after promising Americans

170
00:09:46,591 --> 00:09:51,030
a new deal is early administration is
important and that it marked much of the

171
00:09:51,031 --> 00:09:54,660
beginning of the modern American
government's influence in society as he

172
00:09:54,661 --> 00:09:56,700
attempted to turn the
great depression around.

173
00:09:56,850 --> 00:10:00,750
Through creating a number
of new government agencies
is subsidizing farmers,

174
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:03,840
saving the banks from collapse,
lowering government salaries,

175
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:08,070
switching off from the gold standard
and expanding many labor programs across

176
00:10:08,071 --> 00:10:08,880
the country.

177
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:13,380
He would indeed be instrumental and
revitalizing much of the country and his

178
00:10:13,381 --> 00:10:17,130
fireside chats. Regular radio
broadcast the liver to the public.

179
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:19,980
He would share many of his
ideas and plans for the country.

180
00:10:20,190 --> 00:10:21,870
In the late 1930s however,

181
00:10:21,871 --> 00:10:25,800
Roosevelt took more of a role in
foreign policy as was feared by many.

182
00:10:25,890 --> 00:10:29,880
The recited treaty had, for all intents
and purposes, failed and an anger.

183
00:10:29,881 --> 00:10:32,730
Germany was rising under the
leadership of Adolph Hitler.

184
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:35,490
War once again seems
eminent on the continent.

185
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:40,020
It did indeed come when Germany invaded
Poland in 1939 and France and Britain

186
00:10:40,021 --> 00:10:43,620
declared war when France was beaten
by Germany much more quickly than was

187
00:10:43,621 --> 00:10:44,250
expected.

188
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:47,940
Concern grew in the United States have a
serious conflict and the government did

189
00:10:47,941 --> 00:10:50,760
lose much of its intention to
remain isolated from the conflict.

190
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,620
The United States did not enter the war,

191
00:10:52,650 --> 00:10:55,650
but it did unofficially take a side
with the allied nations of Britain,

192
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:59,760
the Soviet Union, the French Resistance in
China against Germany, Japan, and Italy.

193
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:01,650
By setting them supplies and arms.

194
00:11:01,770 --> 00:11:04,920
In 1941 Japan was stale
mating with the Chinese,

195
00:11:04,921 --> 00:11:07,320
but was looking to expand
into other regions as well,

196
00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:09,720
most notably Southeast Asia.
However,

197
00:11:09,721 --> 00:11:14,040
Southeast Asia had been
colonized predominantly by
the British and the United

198
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:16,050
States. Recall, of course,
that the Philippines,

199
00:11:16,051 --> 00:11:19,290
we're essentially an American colony
annex. Following the Spanish American war,

200
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:23,010
the Japanese knew that it could not match
the British and American naval support,

201
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:26,400
but it nevertheless felt a
pressure to expand into their lens.

202
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:30,510
So a decided instead to attempt to wipe
out the allied naval bases in the region

203
00:11:30,511 --> 00:11:31,231
before war,

204
00:11:31,231 --> 00:11:36,090
which they saw as inevitable
began on December 7th,

205
00:11:36,090 --> 00:11:39,240
1941 date, which President
Roosevelt said with live in infamy,

206
00:11:39,330 --> 00:11:42,210
the Japanese attack,
the American naval base at Pearl Harbor.

207
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:46,770
The United States now had entered into
a war against Japan and subsequently

208
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,950
Hitler declared war on the US.

209
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:53,590
While Roosevelt had walked to join the
war in some manner he now has from the

210
00:11:53,591 --> 00:11:57,640
American people, which followed from the
attack and the u s began to mobilize.

211
00:11:57,850 --> 00:12:01,690
The attack on Pearl Harbor was much
less of a victory than was intended,

212
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:05,950
but the Japanese began
successfully assaulting much
of Asia taking American and

213
00:12:05,951 --> 00:12:09,310
British territory rapidly extending all
the way up to the borders of British

214
00:12:09,311 --> 00:12:10,300
India and Australia.

215
00:12:10,301 --> 00:12:15,160
Even support on the allied side now
increased considerably with the direct

216
00:12:15,161 --> 00:12:16,900
American intervention in the war.

217
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:21,960
The U s would invade North Africa along
with the British in June of 1942 the US

218
00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:25,810
would win the battle of midway in
the Pacific against Japan dealing a

219
00:12:25,811 --> 00:12:29,470
devastating blows their navy.
In September of that year,

220
00:12:29,471 --> 00:12:34,471
the u s would engage the
Japanese at Guadalcanal and
would win an early 1943 the

221
00:12:34,751 --> 00:12:38,950
war was beginning to turn around in 1943
in Europe as well as the Soviet Union

222
00:12:38,951 --> 00:12:41,020
was beginning to repel German advances.

223
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:45,790
Italians and Germans surrendered in North
Africa in May and the allies invaded

224
00:12:45,791 --> 00:12:47,440
mainland Italy in September.

225
00:12:47,590 --> 00:12:51,190
The others came to a standstill even
though many Italians were not sympathetic

226
00:12:51,191 --> 00:12:52,024
to the allies.

227
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:55,900
The allies had planned for an alternative
routes into Europe through northern

228
00:12:55,901 --> 00:12:58,030
France.
The invasion,

229
00:12:58,150 --> 00:13:01,090
which was the largest
seaborne invasion in history,

230
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:05,920
came on June 6th, 1944 often
referred to as d day and Normandy,

231
00:13:05,921 --> 00:13:06,754
France.

232
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:11,170
Five key beaches were selected by the
allies to obtain in the effort nickname

233
00:13:11,171 --> 00:13:12,640
that Utah and Omaha,

234
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:17,350
which the Americans we focus
on the British at Golden
Sword and the Canadians at

235
00:13:17,351 --> 00:13:21,040
Juno, the ranks we bolstered by soldiers
from many other countries as well,

236
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:25,060
including the French Resistance,
Australians checks, Norwegians, Poles,

237
00:13:25,061 --> 00:13:29,080
and dames leading the Americans here
was General Dwight d Eisenhower.

238
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:32,860
The Germans were rather unprepared for
this assault as they were expecting it to

239
00:13:32,861 --> 00:13:37,120
come on. Kallai around 10,000
people would die in these battles,

240
00:13:37,121 --> 00:13:40,600
but they were successful allied victory
as a now how to foot hold on the

241
00:13:40,601 --> 00:13:44,740
continent and the east general Douglas
Macarthur pushed and closer toward

242
00:13:44,741 --> 00:13:49,741
mainland Japan throughout the rest of
1944 and into 1945 the allies pushed and

243
00:13:50,111 --> 00:13:52,300
had Germany, Britain, America, Canada,

244
00:13:52,301 --> 00:13:55,660
and their allies from the west with
the Soviet Union from the east with the

245
00:13:55,661 --> 00:13:58,420
Soviets and circling
Berlin Germany's capital.

246
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:01,780
Hitler committed suicide on April 30th,

247
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:04,660
1945 and his successor made
peace despite Hitler's wishes.

248
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:07,840
It was made official on May 7th,

249
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:10,930
1945 now known as the e or
a victory in Europe Day.

250
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:12,640
The European theater had been one,

251
00:14:12,641 --> 00:14:15,940
but the eastern theater spearheaded
primarily by the United States was still

252
00:14:15,941 --> 00:14:20,230
active. The Japanese we're
losing, but we're still
fiercely resisting. The allies.

253
00:14:20,231 --> 00:14:23,790
Fear to land invasion of Japan would
be brutal, costly, and drawn up,

254
00:14:23,791 --> 00:14:25,720
possibly lasting for years.
However,

255
00:14:25,721 --> 00:14:28,600
the United States had
another plan that same year.

256
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:32,620
The first successful atomic bomb test
had been had taken place in New Mexico.

257
00:14:32,890 --> 00:14:35,560
Now the Americans intended
to use it on Japan.

258
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:39,060
The decision fell under the
presidency of Harry s Truman,

259
00:14:39,070 --> 00:14:43,090
as Roosevelt had died on April 12th of
that year while serving his fourth term,

260
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:48,310
it was approved and the
cities of Hiroshima and
Nagasaki were bombed on August

261
00:14:48,310 --> 00:14:53,310
6th and ninth in 1945 the
month the Japanese surrendered
and the war had come to

262
00:14:54,111 --> 00:14:57,920
a close. The war had claimed the
lives of around 60 million people,

263
00:14:57,921 --> 00:15:01,520
perhaps even up to 80 million
if you include the seeds
and famines caused by the

264
00:15:01,521 --> 00:15:04,790
war. Many were soldiers, many
were civilian casualties.

265
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:09,220
Some civilians around 11 million or
so were specific targets. As a Nazi.

266
00:15:09,221 --> 00:15:11,030
He's intended to rid Germany of groups.

267
00:15:11,031 --> 00:15:14,270
They considered undesirable or
troublesome through genocide,

268
00:15:14,271 --> 00:15:18,890
known as a holocaust, most literally
6 million Jews, but also homosexuals,

269
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:20,870
the mentally handicapped Gypsies,

270
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:23,780
communists and sterilize
other groups like blacks.

271
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:27,170
World War II fundamentally
change the United States.

272
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:30,410
It had pulled the nation out of the
Great Depression with a large increase in

273
00:15:30,411 --> 00:15:34,310
GDP and ended unemployment and had
modernize the American military,

274
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:37,730
but many changes were unprecedented
in all of American history.

275
00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:42,650
The United States how to merge to replace
the Europeans as a world power and

276
00:15:42,651 --> 00:15:46,040
that had come out of the isolation
and general self sufficiency,

277
00:15:46,041 --> 00:15:50,210
which which the founding fathers had
intended for the nation and jumped into

278
00:15:50,211 --> 00:15:54,380
being active in the entire world theater
a change which lasts to this day.

279
00:15:54,650 --> 00:15:59,180
Furthermore, though the US had lost
around 400,000 soldiers in the war,

280
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:02,150
the mainland was essentially
unraveled by conflict.

281
00:16:02,210 --> 00:16:05,510
Unlike much of Europe and Asia
allowing for more unimpeded growth,

282
00:16:05,690 --> 00:16:09,020
United States was not the only world
power to emerge from the fight. However,

283
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:13,100
the Soviet Union though
it had faced horrifying
destruction and his homeland and

284
00:16:13,101 --> 00:16:13,934
major losses.

285
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:18,050
Pet also merged as a dominant world
power and the strain between the two was

286
00:16:18,051 --> 00:16:20,840
evident even before the war was over.
The two sides,

287
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:23,330
the US letting one and the USSR,

288
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:27,050
the other forum to not merely at a
geopolitical tensions and interests,

289
00:16:27,051 --> 00:16:29,780
but economic and ideological
tensions as well.

290
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:31,910
And the earlier parts of the 20th century,

291
00:16:31,911 --> 00:16:34,670
Russia had been overthrown
by communist revolution.

292
00:16:34,850 --> 00:16:38,690
The United States had opposed this
revolution from beginning and much of the

293
00:16:38,691 --> 00:16:42,590
capitalist west were hostile toward it.
Up to this time period.

294
00:16:42,950 --> 00:16:46,760
The USSR had been somewhat isolationist
up to this point as well though not as

295
00:16:46,761 --> 00:16:47,660
much.
However,

296
00:16:47,990 --> 00:16:51,830
it now saw an opportunity to spread
its ideology across the globe as well.

297
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:56,240
The newly formed United Nations was
created with an intent to try to prevent a

298
00:16:56,241 --> 00:17:01,040
certain what war which with the Soviet
and American scoring up did not seem like

299
00:17:01,041 --> 00:17:02,330
such an impossibility.

300
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:06,170
And the era in which such a devastating
conflict loom that's a threat is known

301
00:17:06,171 --> 00:17:10,220
as the Cold War era. Both sides
claim to be fighting for freedom,

302
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:13,160
liberation and overall
good and battles to come.

303
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,440
But for now they were
busy dividing Europe.

304
00:17:15,590 --> 00:17:18,470
Debate emerged over how to divide posts.
Nazi Europe.

305
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:22,910
The Soviets were keen on maintaining the
lands which they had occupied following

306
00:17:22,911 --> 00:17:23,600
the war.

307
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:27,140
While the western side was intent on
keeping communism from spreading and war

308
00:17:27,141 --> 00:17:31,310
torn nations work again, a foothold,
a policy known as containment.

309
00:17:31,670 --> 00:17:36,110
This division has split Germany between
East and West as well as the capital of

310
00:17:36,111 --> 00:17:40,130
Berlin itself. The United States
eventually adopted the Marshall Plan,

311
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:43,610
which serves to provide resources
and funds to fight against communists

312
00:17:43,611 --> 00:17:47,630
takeovers and help reconstruct
Europe and Japan at home as well.

313
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:51,930
There was concern of communist takeover
and anticommunist propaganda became

314
00:17:51,931 --> 00:17:54,900
increased as a red scare
took root in a nation.

315
00:17:55,230 --> 00:18:00,230
In 1949 the two sides became more clearly
differentiated when and respond to the

316
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:01,920
Warsaw Pact created by the Soviet Union.

317
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:07,230
The U s helps found NATO or the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization between these

318
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:11,970
two nations exist a metaphorical wall
or as Winston Churchill described it in

319
00:18:11,971 --> 00:18:16,740
iron curtain. As the Soviets tested their
first nuclear weapon that same year,

320
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:20,430
it became clearer that any conflict that
would emerge directly between the two

321
00:18:20,431 --> 00:18:23,250
nations would be even more to Shuck Div.
In the Second World War,

322
00:18:23,251 --> 00:18:27,630
possibly even as scientists and military
experts came to conclude a threat to

323
00:18:27,631 --> 00:18:31,740
the human species itself.
The situation of the world was changing.

324
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:36,060
The old European empires of
Britain, France, Germany,
Portugal, Spain, et cetera.

325
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:40,170
We're now ending as new nations rose
up and revolutions or grunted freedoms

326
00:18:40,171 --> 00:18:41,004
peacefully.

327
00:18:41,010 --> 00:18:44,730
The United States and Soviet Union both
attempted to influence these new nations

328
00:18:44,731 --> 00:18:48,450
and wind them to their side and
defining aspect of the Cold War.

329
00:18:48,810 --> 00:18:51,810
In the 1950s many conflicts
would emerge from the cold war.

330
00:18:52,050 --> 00:18:56,250
The Korean War was one of the first
following World War II who Korea was

331
00:18:56,251 --> 00:18:57,300
liberated from Japan,

332
00:18:57,301 --> 00:19:01,860
but also to vita between the USSR and
the US and emerged as to separate nations

333
00:19:01,950 --> 00:19:03,570
of north and South Korea.

334
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:08,790
Neither side was indeed
content on remaining separate
nations and eventually war

335
00:19:08,791 --> 00:19:09,780
broke out between them.

336
00:19:09,781 --> 00:19:14,670
In 1950 the north was supported by the
USSR and eventually more directly by the

337
00:19:14,671 --> 00:19:17,400
newly formed Communist.
People's Republic of China.

338
00:19:17,670 --> 00:19:21,630
The South was supported by the United
Nations and send soldiers into Korea on

339
00:19:21,631 --> 00:19:25,680
South Korea's behalf consisting
primarily of American soldiers.

340
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:29,430
However, when the Chinese
entered the war on Korea side,

341
00:19:29,431 --> 00:19:33,090
the two sides eventually
reached a stalemate and
President Eisenhower was eager

342
00:19:33,091 --> 00:19:37,950
to make peace, which they did in 1953
vote. A vision remains to this day.

343
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:41,640
In 1960 John F.
Kennedy was elected as president.

344
00:19:42,090 --> 00:19:46,890
In 1961 the CIA attempted to overthrow
the Cuban dictator, Fidel Castro,

345
00:19:46,891 --> 00:19:50,670
using Cuban exiles in what is
known as the Bay of Pigs invasion.

346
00:19:50,850 --> 00:19:55,140
But Castro likely knew the invasion was
coming and defeated us backed forces and

347
00:19:55,141 --> 00:19:57,630
solidify the country
against the western powers.

348
00:19:57,930 --> 00:20:01,200
Cuba's relations with the Soviet
Union would continue to grow,

349
00:20:01,230 --> 00:20:05,280
which worried many Americans as Cuba
is a mere 90 miles from the coast of

350
00:20:05,281 --> 00:20:06,660
Florida.
The following year,

351
00:20:06,661 --> 00:20:09,390
the Soviets intended to send
nuclear missiles to Cuba,

352
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:11,430
but President Kennedy and Soviet leader,

353
00:20:11,431 --> 00:20:15,390
Nikita Khrushchev agreed to remove
nuclear missiles from Cuban Turkey,

354
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:20,100
avoiding an escalation to what could
become a third world war known as a Cuban

355
00:20:20,101 --> 00:20:24,660
missile crisis. In 1957 a new
conflict emerged from the cold war,

356
00:20:24,661 --> 00:20:28,200
though not one of arms and soldiers,
but of technology and science.

357
00:20:28,290 --> 00:20:29,250
The space race,

358
00:20:29,430 --> 00:20:33,240
the space race was a competition to
explore space which was rooted and the

359
00:20:33,241 --> 00:20:37,440
potential that technology would extend
conflict into outer space and that the

360
00:20:37,441 --> 00:20:41,610
first nation to get a foothold in this
new theater would have an advantage in

361
00:20:41,611 --> 00:20:42,444
near succumb.

362
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:47,260
The Soviet Union would put the first
satellite in this space in 1957 known as

363
00:20:47,261 --> 00:20:52,180
Sputnik and in 1961 would put the first
human in his space, Uri Gaga Green.

364
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:54,220
However,
in 1969 in the United States with land,

365
00:20:54,221 --> 00:20:58,570
the first person on the moon and in fact
a whole nother world, Neil Armstrong,

366
00:20:58,660 --> 00:20:59,170
however,

367
00:20:59,170 --> 00:21:03,670
the 1967 space treaty prohibited land
claims or the establishment of military

368
00:21:03,671 --> 00:21:06,700
bases on the moon or
other celestial bodies.

369
00:21:06,910 --> 00:21:10,210
Once the solar system was designated
for scientific study alone,

370
00:21:10,330 --> 00:21:15,310
the US and Russia began to cool their
efforts into space and no nation ever did

371
00:21:15,311 --> 00:21:18,070
anything of equivalent magnitude in space.
Again,

372
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:21,870
in 1964 following the
Gulf of Tonkin incident,

373
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:25,330
two incidents in which was claimed
that Vietnamese ships had fired.

374
00:21:25,331 --> 00:21:26,650
I'm the U S has Maddix,

375
00:21:26,890 --> 00:21:30,410
although there is uncertain evidence that
this actually happened. The specialty,

376
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:32,590
the second attack though
possibly the first as well,

377
00:21:32,710 --> 00:21:36,820
the United States began taking a more
direct role in another war raging from the

378
00:21:36,821 --> 00:21:38,980
aftermath of European decolonization.

379
00:21:39,910 --> 00:21:44,470
Civil war had been raging there since
at least 1955 following liberation from

380
00:21:44,471 --> 00:21:46,180
France in Vietnam,

381
00:21:46,181 --> 00:21:50,830
socialists back northerners were engaged
in conflict against the NATO back south.

382
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:55,630
The war waged on into the 70s and may
protest against if utility and lack of

383
00:21:55,631 --> 00:21:57,970
necessity for the war
erupted in the United States,

384
00:21:58,330 --> 00:22:01,030
which put pressure on the government
to limit participation in it.

385
00:22:01,150 --> 00:22:04,990
Though it was considered vital by the
government and much of the population to

386
00:22:04,991 --> 00:22:09,310
stop the spread of communism in Southeast
Asia and the u s pressed hard dropping

387
00:22:09,311 --> 00:22:13,420
more bombs in Vietnam then were used
in all of World War II and utilizing

388
00:22:13,421 --> 00:22:16,390
chemical weapons such as agent orange.
During this time,

389
00:22:16,391 --> 00:22:20,440
the public was protesting many other
things besides increased American military

390
00:22:20,441 --> 00:22:23,470
intervention across the world.
Many social movements,

391
00:22:23,471 --> 00:22:26,470
particularly those concern the
rights of African Americans,

392
00:22:26,471 --> 00:22:31,090
women and other minorities sprang up
and notable figure from this time period

393
00:22:31,091 --> 00:22:35,950
was Dr. Martin Luther King Jr who sought
to end institutionalized racism against

394
00:22:35,951 --> 00:22:38,860
African Americans and achieve
complete equal status.

395
00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:44,350
This was essentially achieved
by 1968 though he was
assassinated later that year,

396
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:46,840
legal racial equality had been achieved,

397
00:22:46,930 --> 00:22:50,620
but throughout the 70s many Americans
felt that traditional values were under

398
00:22:50,621 --> 00:22:54,490
attack by more extreme social movements
and there was a call for them to return

399
00:22:54,491 --> 00:22:57,940
on a conservative leadership leading
to the election of Richard Nixon.

400
00:22:57,941 --> 00:23:02,440
Though he would eventually
resigned following the
Watergate scandal in 1979 the

401
00:23:02,441 --> 00:23:04,000
United States withdrew from Vietnam.

402
00:23:04,001 --> 00:23:06,820
Is North Vietnamese successfully
conquered the rest of the country.

403
00:23:06,910 --> 00:23:10,750
This war was the first in history which
the United States it clearly lost.

404
00:23:10,930 --> 00:23:14,890
Recall of course that wars like Korea
or more distantly the war of 1812 are

405
00:23:14,891 --> 00:23:18,490
considered still mates and from
some perspectives, victories.

406
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:22,330
Those who had supported the war were
disappointed with the outcome Lois would

407
00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:25,990
oppose that were angered by what they
saw as a disingenuous nature of the

408
00:23:25,991 --> 00:23:30,010
government and pursuing it. The larger
cold war still continued, however,

409
00:23:30,011 --> 00:23:33,910
throughout the 70s but though the east
and west pursued more peaceful relations,

410
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:36,220
economic conditions in the United States,

411
00:23:36,221 --> 00:23:39,850
worse than in the 70s in many companies
even moved outside of the nation.

412
00:23:39,970 --> 00:23:42,280
Cities like Detroit, Chicago, Cleveland,

413
00:23:42,281 --> 00:23:45,470
and New York in particular were
hit by an economic downfall.

414
00:23:45,770 --> 00:23:49,670
In 1980 peaceful relations with the
Soviet Union began to sour again as a

415
00:23:49,671 --> 00:23:52,790
Soviets invaded Afghanistan
to install a communist regime.

416
00:23:52,791 --> 00:23:56,510
There there had already been turmoil in
the Middle East on both sides and the

417
00:23:56,511 --> 00:23:59,390
region, whether it's great
wealth of oil became important.

418
00:23:59,391 --> 00:24:01,580
Both the Soviet Union
and the United States.

419
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:04,910
President Carter announced the Soviet
Union for their invasion and led many

420
00:24:04,911 --> 00:24:09,860
countries to boycott the 1980 Moscow
Olympics in 1980 president Ronald Reagan

421
00:24:09,861 --> 00:24:13,100
was elected unifying may,
branches of conservative thought.

422
00:24:13,130 --> 00:24:16,130
He believed in both
limited federal government,

423
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:19,400
but also was vigorously active
in pursuing the Cold War.

424
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:23,140
He increased military
spending dramatically and
attempted to give the US the

425
00:24:23,150 --> 00:24:27,320
capability to shoot down Soviet missiles
in space. Though this endeavor failed,

426
00:24:27,470 --> 00:24:31,850
he would also engage in conflicts in
Lebanon, Grenada, Libya, El Salvador,

427
00:24:31,851 --> 00:24:35,720
Guatemala, and also supported with
how to Dean rebels in Afghanistan.

428
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:38,600
Though this organization would
later turn into the al Qaeda,

429
00:24:38,930 --> 00:24:42,200
more specifically with the Soviets, how
were things were beginning to look bleak?

430
00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:45,650
The Soviet Union was falling behind
technologically and economically,

431
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:49,280
and that was becoming more evident to
the rest of the world. Mikhail Gorbachev,

432
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:54,400
the Soviet Union's leader at the time
attempted to save communism in the USSR by

433
00:24:54,411 --> 00:24:58,580
ending the arms race with the u s and by
releasing and script on Eastern Europe.

434
00:24:58,970 --> 00:25:01,580
But this would fail.
And on Christmas Day,

435
00:25:01,581 --> 00:25:06,020
1991 the Soviet Union would fall
apart in communism with it and Russia,

436
00:25:06,470 --> 00:25:10,340
the Cold War had ended. The United
States emerged from the Cold War,

437
00:25:10,341 --> 00:25:15,140
as for all intents and purposes and
unchallenged superpower and continue to

438
00:25:15,141 --> 00:25:16,670
intervene in foreign complex.

439
00:25:17,450 --> 00:25:21,830
Some saw this as American imperialism
and the betrayal of nation's founding

440
00:25:21,831 --> 00:25:26,090
principles, others as an obligation
to police the world as it is called,

441
00:25:26,091 --> 00:25:30,470
following nearly a century of horrific
warfare and the potential for even worse

442
00:25:30,471 --> 00:25:32,750
warfare. Either way, they
will continue to do so.

443
00:25:32,750 --> 00:25:37,610
As George H w Bush intervened in Kuwait
against Iraq, remembered as a Gulf war,

444
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:39,380
which was a decisive victory.

445
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:43,370
This continued intervention and world
affairs along with inventions like the

446
00:25:43,371 --> 00:25:47,570
Internet and faster means
of transportation and
communication and things of that

447
00:25:47,571 --> 00:25:51,170
nature have led to terms like
globalization popping up in politics,

448
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:53,870
which can be ambiguous
and have many meanings,

449
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:57,980
but refers generally to a world which
is becoming increasingly connected.

450
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:01,790
A world in which the United States
is playing a leading role as day.

451
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:06,170
Throughout the 90s and into the modern
day terrorism began increasing in the

452
00:26:06,171 --> 00:26:08,300
United States and in fact,
much of the world,

453
00:26:08,330 --> 00:26:11,990
the great majority of these terrorists
being from Islamic radical groups,

454
00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:16,280
the most significant incident and American
history of such a terrorist attack is

455
00:26:16,281 --> 00:26:21,281
referred to as nine 11 and attack on the
World Trade Center on September 11th,

456
00:26:21,950 --> 00:26:26,950
2001 as well as the Pentagon and the
failed attack on Washington d c these

457
00:26:26,961 --> 00:26:30,740
attacks would mark the beginning of
increased conflict in the Middle East in

458
00:26:30,741 --> 00:26:32,300
Iraq and Afghanistan.

459
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:36,650
The occurrences of wish we had dealt
with through the presidency of America's

460
00:26:36,651 --> 00:26:38,750
first black President Barack Obama,

461
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:41,720
into our modern day with Donald J.

462
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:46,720
Trump serving as our 45th
we still continue to face
many of the economic strains

463
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:49,320
I began and the two
thousands or even further,

464
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:53,520
as well as a continuation
of social movements to have
roots in the nation's very

465
00:26:53,521 --> 00:26:57,570
foundation. And thus we have reached
our own era. And this documentary.

466
00:26:57,900 --> 00:26:58,920
Needless to say,

467
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:04,080
the United States of 1776 and the 2018
are almost completely different worlds in

468
00:27:04,681 --> 00:27:08,490
terms of government and
political structure and
culture and societal structure

469
00:27:08,550 --> 00:27:12,360
changes obviously to be expected as
the events we have discussed in this

470
00:27:12,361 --> 00:27:15,060
documentary reshaped
the nation year by year.

471
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:18,390
But in deciding the future
of the United States,

472
00:27:18,391 --> 00:27:20,370
we must study the history and the side,

473
00:27:20,371 --> 00:27:23,670
which changes are for the
good and which were mistakes.

474
00:27:23,910 --> 00:27:26,400
But that is something I leave
to you to decide for yourself.

475
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:30,990
The United States is a new nation,
but it may indeed have many years to come.

476
00:27:30,991 --> 00:27:34,980
And its future as a democratic nation
depends upon the decisions of the various

477
00:27:34,981 --> 00:27:39,750
groups of peoples who inhabited most
of which, what is done with land.

478
00:27:39,790 --> 00:27:43,650
The cell considered the land
of opportunity to support
the creation and more
