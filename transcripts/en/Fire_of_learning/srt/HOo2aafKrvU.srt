00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:04,410
Hello and welcome to fire of learning
the Myers Briggs type indicator as an

2
00:00:04,411 --> 00:00:07,050
increasingly popular subject
as a personality test,

3
00:00:07,051 --> 00:00:08,310
which assigns you four letters,

4
00:00:08,311 --> 00:00:11,400
which determine certain preferences
for decision making and highly your

5
00:00:11,401 --> 00:00:13,170
perspectives on things
and things like that.

6
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:15,990
I've made several videos
on the subject already,

7
00:00:15,991 --> 00:00:20,220
but we can't really talk about NBTI
without discussing the scientific validity

8
00:00:20,221 --> 00:00:24,690
of it. Some people claim as a fairly
useful reference for personalities.

9
00:00:24,691 --> 00:00:27,110
Others are concerned
that it's pseudoscience,

10
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:31,380
perhaps just astrology with
a psychological theme or
perhaps even that maybe

11
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:34,530
it's not pseudoscience,
but the results aren't all that useful.

12
00:00:34,531 --> 00:00:36,600
So what's going on here?
Well,

13
00:00:36,601 --> 00:00:40,410
let's start it by saying that many aspects
of psychology to begin with are a bit

14
00:00:40,411 --> 00:00:43,440
of a jungle to navigate there,
especially personality psychology,

15
00:00:43,441 --> 00:00:47,160
which is why at times it's harder to
determine the objective and the scientific

16
00:00:47,161 --> 00:00:48,720
validity of a psychological claim.

17
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:52,710
And it would be to address the comparable
scientific question of physics or

18
00:00:52,711 --> 00:00:53,970
biology or something like that.

19
00:00:53,971 --> 00:00:58,200
As research is a time subject to more
variables in errors in psychology.

20
00:00:58,320 --> 00:00:59,071
Regardless,

21
00:00:59,071 --> 00:01:02,460
under no circumstances should we abandon
the scientific method and thought

22
00:01:02,461 --> 00:01:03,840
process and we shall not do.

23
00:01:03,841 --> 00:01:07,680
So here there's a million personality
tests and each of them must be weighed by

24
00:01:07,681 --> 00:01:11,670
its predictability, consistency,
and applicability. And
as far as the NBTI goes,

25
00:01:11,690 --> 00:01:15,720
the evidence when it is examined beyond
a superficial understanding seems to

26
00:01:15,721 --> 00:01:17,670
suggest validity and accuracy.

27
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:20,520
So we're going through explain why and
then we're going to address counter

28
00:01:20,521 --> 00:01:21,354
arguments.

29
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:25,590
So the Myers Briggs type indicator assigns
you after taking a test for letters

30
00:01:25,591 --> 00:01:29,310
based off of four little dichotomy
leading to 16 different types.

31
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:33,390
The letters indicate whether you are an
I or an e and introvert or an extrovert,

32
00:01:33,391 --> 00:01:35,820
an s or an end,
a sensor or an intuitor,

33
00:01:35,821 --> 00:01:40,320
a t or an f as thinker or a feeler and
a j or a p, a judger or a perceiver.

34
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:43,110
If you're not fully aware of what
these terms mean, don't worry.

35
00:01:43,111 --> 00:01:46,230
We'll address each dichotomy
here and each type, as I said,

36
00:01:46,231 --> 00:01:48,270
supposedly gives it an
analysis of your personality,

37
00:01:48,271 --> 00:01:50,550
but highlighting her decision
making preferences and perspectives.

38
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:53,370
Let's get into the letters I versus e,

39
00:01:53,371 --> 00:01:55,650
introversion versus extroversion.

40
00:01:55,651 --> 00:01:58,740
That's kind of already a commonly
understood concept and one which I have

41
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:02,490
personally never really encountered
serious criticism of on its own and so

42
00:02:02,491 --> 00:02:07,290
beyond saying that obviously it like every
other little review here is more of a

43
00:02:07,291 --> 00:02:09,690
preference on a spectrum
and a different difference.

44
00:02:09,691 --> 00:02:14,220
I he most people are not good Gary as
entertainers or hermetic introverts most

45
00:02:14,221 --> 00:02:15,690
lie in between extremes.

46
00:02:15,691 --> 00:02:20,070
I won't really spend much time addressing
this concept accordingly as versus an

47
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:24,300
sensing versus intuition. What's
this will according to what is said,

48
00:02:24,301 --> 00:02:27,990
intuitive types and types handle
abstract concepts and ideas pretty well.

49
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:31,020
Generally they look for expanding meeting
and things that contemplate the big

50
00:02:31,021 --> 00:02:34,590
picture very well, et cetera. Whereas
ss I'm more pragmatic down to earth.

51
00:02:34,591 --> 00:02:37,770
They referred immediate facts and
details and enjoy accompanying systems.

52
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:42,180
They're not really all that interested
in abstract things. Now tests clarify.

53
00:02:42,181 --> 00:02:45,810
Obviously everyone spends time doing
practical pragmatic thinking and everyone

54
00:02:45,811 --> 00:02:50,070
spends time with abstract concepts. It's
more of a spectrum. As I said. However,

55
00:02:50,071 --> 00:02:53,700
the difference is not inconsequential
and there was a reason the three fourths

56
00:02:53,701 --> 00:02:57,360
of people are s's and one fourth
test and in the United States,

57
00:02:57,630 --> 00:03:02,080
while sensor types are necessarily stupid,
I know a few acids with in fact,

58
00:03:02,081 --> 00:03:06,560
high Iq is the traits of intuitive types
seem to correlate to higher abilities

59
00:03:06,561 --> 00:03:10,780
to contemplate abstract concepts which
is closely linked to above average Iq.

60
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:13,480
Thankfully,
this isn't just my speculation.

61
00:03:13,481 --> 00:03:15,460
There's been tests on this exact question.

62
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:18,440
Here's some charts showing the results
of those tests and of course lengths of

63
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:21,890
the research and a description.
What we see here is interesting.

64
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:24,970
Firstly see the correlation
between introversion and Iq,

65
00:03:24,971 --> 00:03:28,330
which is also an already established
and scientifically backed correlation,

66
00:03:28,331 --> 00:03:30,340
but I won't expand on that in this video.

67
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:34,060
What is important though is that
intuitive types line up perfectly with the

68
00:03:34,061 --> 00:03:37,660
higher Iq scores as opposed to ss with
a little bit of currently negligible

69
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:41,560
differences between t's and F's and peas
and Jay's with the INTP according to

70
00:03:41,561 --> 00:03:43,210
this research coming out on top.

71
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:47,800
Now this doesn't mean that all ends have
gifted Iq or that all acids, as I said,

72
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:48,490
do not.

73
00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:52,120
And we could of course spend all day
pondering the meaning of different values

74
00:03:52,121 --> 00:03:55,120
for different kinds of intelligence
and intelligence is and all that.

75
00:03:55,121 --> 00:03:59,200
But when it comes to Iq and subsequently
the closely linked concept of abstract

76
00:03:59,201 --> 00:03:59,950
intelligence,

77
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:04,330
the gifted have greater likelihoods of
testing and then s reinforcing what is in

78
00:04:04,331 --> 00:04:07,060
my opinion and obvious correlation.
Furthermore,

79
00:04:07,061 --> 00:04:11,080
I think this dispels a ridiculous notion
that Acu has no meaningful effect on

80
00:04:11,081 --> 00:04:13,210
someone's personality.
And to expand on that,

81
00:04:13,211 --> 00:04:18,211
if we look at the personality
traits of a High Iq person such as,

82
00:04:18,251 --> 00:04:22,780
for example, a quick comprehension of
abstract topics, creativity, curiosity,

83
00:04:22,781 --> 00:04:26,500
fear of failure, rejection of authority
in favor of independent conclusions.

84
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:30,940
We see basically the same traits which
the NBTI describes as intuitive types.

85
00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:34,310
Let's move on to thinking
versus feeling t versus uh,

86
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:37,540
according to the NBTI information,
simply put,

87
00:04:37,541 --> 00:04:41,710
t's prefer to make decisions based off
of objective criteria and the quarterly

88
00:04:41,711 --> 00:04:46,300
favor decisions and solutions to problems
which are in accordance with facts and

89
00:04:46,301 --> 00:04:47,020
data.

90
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:50,380
Efs prefer to make decisions based on
a set of values and favor decisions and

91
00:04:50,381 --> 00:04:52,630
solutions which are in
accordance with those values.

92
00:04:52,631 --> 00:04:55,480
And what the greater human factor
in mind for whatever reason.

93
00:04:55,481 --> 00:04:58,520
Some people to spell this as being
completely unfactual and not based on

94
00:04:58,521 --> 00:05:01,420
anything but really when you examine
the evidence to find that thinking is

95
00:05:01,421 --> 00:05:03,400
preferred by about 56% of males,

96
00:05:03,401 --> 00:05:08,290
but more importantly feeling is preferred
by 75% of females and then we compare

97
00:05:08,291 --> 00:05:11,650
what is found through to psychology
studies and demonstrate that men have a

98
00:05:11,651 --> 00:05:15,400
tendency to make decisions based on
objective criteria and offer solutions to

99
00:05:15,401 --> 00:05:15,820
problems.

100
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:19,840
Whereas women are more empathetic and
more often offer support for problems.

101
00:05:19,841 --> 00:05:23,500
It's fairly obvious that was a TF
dichotomy is highlighting are these

102
00:05:23,501 --> 00:05:25,270
scientifically backed differences?

103
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:30,490
I've seen plenty of criticism towards
NBTI stating that emotions and empathy for

104
00:05:30,491 --> 00:05:34,960
other people are independent of
processes involved with logical thought,

105
00:05:34,961 --> 00:05:37,180
but that's not what Nbti highlights.

106
00:05:37,181 --> 00:05:39,430
It highlights more of a
decision making process,

107
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:44,640
not how well people understand logic or
how empathetic people aren't necessarily

108
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:49,270
now for the difference in perception
versus judging according to the Myers

109
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:52,390
Briggs descriptions. Perceivers
ps essentially prefer flexibility.

110
00:05:52,391 --> 00:05:54,670
They prefer to improvise
their plans and be adaptable.

111
00:05:54,890 --> 00:05:57,680
There are a little bit more spontaneous
and they prefer to work in bursts of

112
00:05:57,681 --> 00:06:00,380
enthusiasm rather than
in an organized plan.

113
00:06:00,530 --> 00:06:03,850
Judgers Jay's prefer to have a structure
to this schedule one daily life and

114
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:06,500
pursuits and such as ever
perhaps a bit more organized.

115
00:06:06,501 --> 00:06:08,690
They prefer to stick to
plans and things like that.

116
00:06:08,690 --> 00:06:13,130
To put it more in terms of what Carl Young
stated when he identified a cognitive

117
00:06:13,131 --> 00:06:17,510
functions, perceivers prefer to judge
things internally and perceive externally.

118
00:06:17,511 --> 00:06:21,810
Whereas judges per sort of prefer to
perceive things internally and an exercise

119
00:06:21,811 --> 00:06:23,330
or judgments on the external world.

120
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:27,290
There are a number of ways to address
this beyond just citing studies that prove

121
00:06:27,291 --> 00:06:30,980
the obvious. It's some people prefer
flexibility and others the organization,

122
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:33,560
one such study is average
income according to type.

123
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:37,280
Now what you would expect from a judger
that has a say to someone who has a

124
00:06:37,281 --> 00:06:41,060
preference for extroverted thinking or
feeling one with first to act on their

125
00:06:41,061 --> 00:06:45,170
environment a bit more will display
a dry to achieve higher economic or

126
00:06:45,171 --> 00:06:49,040
otherwise success and what easily end
up in positions of leadership which tend

127
00:06:49,041 --> 00:06:52,820
to pay higher and such.
Statistics show exactly this.

128
00:06:52,910 --> 00:06:56,300
The ENT J by far has the
highest average income,

129
00:06:56,301 --> 00:07:00,950
probably a mixture of extroverted thinking
and intuition followed by the EST j

130
00:07:00,951 --> 00:07:05,810
the Eso j and then the Nfj Ist Jay and
I and t j sort of have about the same

131
00:07:05,811 --> 00:07:09,410
level of average income according to
this chart and only after that that we

132
00:07:09,411 --> 00:07:12,410
start to see perceiving
types of GSTP and enf p.

133
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:14,210
Some surveys differ a little bit,

134
00:07:14,211 --> 00:07:17,930
but consistently extroverted thinkers
and feelers, Aka judging types.

135
00:07:17,931 --> 00:07:22,040
Jay's except of course for ISF J's and
nine of Jay's who are a bit different,

136
00:07:22,041 --> 00:07:25,610
tend to have higher average incomes
than other proceeding types.

137
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:28,550
Reinforcing the notion
that this is not arbitrary,

138
00:07:28,670 --> 00:07:32,030
so that's basically the argument
concerning the scientific backing of NBTI.

139
00:07:32,031 --> 00:07:35,360
Evidence seems to suggest that these
personality differences and descriptions

140
00:07:35,361 --> 00:07:38,930
have a correlation to scientifically
back to research if it's not a survey or

141
00:07:38,931 --> 00:07:40,430
study of the types of cells.

142
00:07:40,431 --> 00:07:43,580
Descriptions can often be supported by
other scientific studies which show a

143
00:07:43,581 --> 00:07:47,240
connection and it's correlation can
be shown to not just be happenstance.

144
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:51,170
The type predicts behavior and numerous
studies have shown an accuracy in

145
00:07:51,171 --> 00:07:54,440
prediction. With all this in mind,
it's time to address some criticisms.

146
00:07:54,590 --> 00:07:56,750
Having dedicated actual time to research,

147
00:07:56,751 --> 00:08:00,110
to objectively and scientific question
and analyze the personality types.

148
00:08:00,110 --> 00:08:00,711
I am a Middle East,

149
00:08:00,711 --> 00:08:04,400
somewhat frustrated by people who've
denounced it without properly analyzing it

150
00:08:04,401 --> 00:08:07,850
because it comes such conclusions
about things without contemplation and

151
00:08:07,851 --> 00:08:09,590
research is overall harmful,

152
00:08:09,591 --> 00:08:13,190
especially when your opinion is taken
into serious consideration by the public.

153
00:08:13,290 --> 00:08:17,690
Some have made videos or written
articles announcing NBTI for misguided or

154
00:08:17,691 --> 00:08:20,270
incorrect reasons along
the lines of we'll man,

155
00:08:20,271 --> 00:08:23,660
you can't define people with do
four letters, dude role unique,

156
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:27,770
but I suppose taking such a starkly
abrasive stance with a little more than

157
00:08:27,771 --> 00:08:31,550
superficial understanding
and bad reasoning is why you
could come to expect from

158
00:08:31,551 --> 00:08:33,260
many modern media sites these days.

159
00:08:33,261 --> 00:08:36,980
And I accordingly take pride in ensuring
that extra steps are taken to make sure

160
00:08:36,981 --> 00:08:41,090
that fire of learning is not on that
boat and is as intellectually honest as

161
00:08:41,091 --> 00:08:45,170
possible to the point at which if the
entirety of my stance here were to be

162
00:08:45,171 --> 00:08:45,891
proven wrong,

163
00:08:45,891 --> 00:08:49,670
I would delete this video and all Myers
Briggs videos to replace them with a

164
00:08:49,671 --> 00:08:52,460
video explaining why I was wrong.
But anyway,

165
00:08:52,461 --> 00:08:56,880
back to the point Allison Fox and
the post writes an article about the

166
00:08:56,881 --> 00:09:00,000
superficial reality of Myers Briggs
types placing at the beginning of her

167
00:09:00,001 --> 00:09:04,620
article, this is where we call bs
personality tests me, nothing, nothing.

168
00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:09,990
This is to begin with a red flag because
it's fairly obviously false claim to

169
00:09:09,991 --> 00:09:10,621
make.
Well,

170
00:09:10,621 --> 00:09:15,240
it may be in fact true that scientifically
human behavior can be as reliably

171
00:09:15,241 --> 00:09:19,260
predicted as physical behavior of
asteroids to suggest that it's so

172
00:09:19,261 --> 00:09:22,800
unpredictable and random that I can be
organized in the general types of general

173
00:09:22,801 --> 00:09:24,690
descriptions,
general descriptions,

174
00:09:24,691 --> 00:09:29,691
mind you not 100% accurate and predictable
categories is an unjustifiable claim.

175
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:34,530
We are each of us perhaps different on
the individual level and even on that

176
00:09:34,531 --> 00:09:38,130
individual level decisions we make and
our behaviors can very unpredictably,

177
00:09:38,131 --> 00:09:41,910
but it's totally misguided to believe
that similarity and personalities and not

178
00:09:41,911 --> 00:09:46,110
exist at those personality similarities
can not be identified and labeled into

179
00:09:46,111 --> 00:09:50,610
specific types and that a personality quiz
can not identify these similar traits.

180
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:53,280
This is why psychologists use tests.

181
00:09:53,310 --> 00:09:56,640
They have a bit more preference for the
big five personality tests and NBTI,

182
00:09:56,641 --> 00:10:00,060
which we'll explain in a moment,
but I'm sorry if it hurts your feelings,

183
00:10:00,061 --> 00:10:04,140
but everyone can be identified and grouped
according to share personality traits

184
00:10:04,141 --> 00:10:06,360
and they are quite frankly consequential.

185
00:10:06,390 --> 00:10:10,560
The author here's fairly vague and doesn't
specify what she means by personality

186
00:10:10,561 --> 00:10:11,820
test because quite frankly,

187
00:10:11,830 --> 00:10:15,180
something like an anxiety or depression
test can be equated to a personality

188
00:10:15,181 --> 00:10:18,180
test and no one would claim
that these are inconsequential.

189
00:10:18,181 --> 00:10:21,780
In the same way that the
author who believes Mpti is
because such aspects of the

190
00:10:21,781 --> 00:10:25,890
human mind play a major role in how people
function and it is obviously accepted

191
00:10:25,891 --> 00:10:29,670
as such, traits lead to similar behaviors
in people which can be identified.

192
00:10:29,850 --> 00:10:32,700
Adam Grant also from the
Huffington post shares her opinion.

193
00:10:32,701 --> 00:10:35,190
He begins by stating that
originally when taking a test,

194
00:10:35,191 --> 00:10:39,750
he typed IMTJ a few months later
he came back and type II SFP.

195
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:43,140
If you see my videos, you know that
these are inverted forums of each other.

196
00:10:43,141 --> 00:10:47,580
The I and T J is n. I. T. E.
F. I. N. S. E. The ESF is s.

197
00:10:47,610 --> 00:10:52,590
E. F. I. T. E. N. N. I. He evidently
claims at the types are so superficial,

198
00:10:52,591 --> 00:10:55,950
but even the distinction between
complete opposite types is arbitrary and

199
00:10:55,951 --> 00:10:56,551
unfounded,

200
00:10:56,551 --> 00:11:01,080
which is entirely misguided and
observing an average IMTJ and ESF p.

201
00:11:01,081 --> 00:11:02,820
The difference is immediately evidence.

202
00:11:02,821 --> 00:11:06,780
I've never met any ESF Jay's who were
actually more like me than what their type

203
00:11:06,781 --> 00:11:07,650
descriptions mentioned,

204
00:11:07,651 --> 00:11:12,090
but of course my personal experience is
not what is used in scientific analysis

205
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:13,230
necessarily.
Ergo,

206
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:17,280
I would have to ask this author to
explain the consistent statistical link

207
00:11:17,281 --> 00:11:20,380
between Income Iq,
profession, gender, etc,

208
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:23,220
and Nbti if these types
are so superficial.

209
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:27,840
He mentioned 16 personalities.com that's
a fairly common sight to take the NBTI.

210
00:11:27,841 --> 00:11:31,020
That's where I first took it. Might
type by the way, has never changed.

211
00:11:31,170 --> 00:11:35,640
I've taken multiple different tests and
each of them I've scored INTP except for

212
00:11:35,641 --> 00:11:38,500
on one,
which I was typed IMTJ no.

213
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:41,910
All my personality results on this
particular test could be brushed off as

214
00:11:41,911 --> 00:11:44,550
obviously I took just
one bad test for others.

215
00:11:44,551 --> 00:11:46,690
The author makes a
shocking statement would,

216
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:50,670
which is often brought up an NBTI
discussion that a considerable amount of

217
00:11:50,671 --> 00:11:51,031
people,

218
00:11:51,031 --> 00:11:54,970
perhaps even three quarters of people
come back to take the test and test as a

219
00:11:54,971 --> 00:11:57,880
different type.
I have no doubts that people do miss type.

220
00:11:57,881 --> 00:12:01,690
I myself have seen people get the wrong
type and fine traits within that wrong

221
00:12:01,691 --> 00:12:03,220
type,
which are applicable to them,

222
00:12:03,221 --> 00:12:07,660
but usually the mistype is not extremely
far off and the fact that at times

223
00:12:07,661 --> 00:12:10,510
people do miss type does not
invalidated types themselves.

224
00:12:10,511 --> 00:12:13,030
Ms [inaudible] occurs in all
similar personality quizzes,

225
00:12:13,031 --> 00:12:15,310
not necessarily because
the test lack any depth,

226
00:12:15,311 --> 00:12:19,210
but because often people change their
answers in accordance with what they'd

227
00:12:19,211 --> 00:12:22,540
like to be treated rather than
what is true. Take. For example,

228
00:12:22,541 --> 00:12:26,740
my ms types quiz result. Perhaps on that
quiz I'm misunderstood some questions.

229
00:12:26,741 --> 00:12:30,780
Perhaps a test wasn't specific enough.
I could have even overestimated or change.

230
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:32,500
My answer is there's
something of that nature.

231
00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:36,640
Imagine if that had been my initial
assault upon learning about NBTI and I

232
00:12:36,641 --> 00:12:40,450
subsequently believe that I
wasn't Imtj and read description.

233
00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:43,690
The description may have indeed been
applicable to me in many aspects.

234
00:12:43,691 --> 00:12:46,870
I may have read it and found
that relatively fitting
even though there were some

235
00:12:46,871 --> 00:12:48,790
things which weren't necessarily true.

236
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,540
Now this is also where a considerable
amount of criticism towards the NBTI comes

237
00:12:52,541 --> 00:12:54,820
in.
People seem to think like astrology.

238
00:12:54,821 --> 00:12:57,820
Each type simply offering the list of
traits which are ambiguous and good.

239
00:12:57,821 --> 00:13:01,030
Their board therefore be applied to
everyone and so people are tricked into

240
00:13:01,031 --> 00:13:02,950
finding it meaningful.
By that logic,

241
00:13:02,951 --> 00:13:06,190
though I could have even typed
ESF and founded applicable.

242
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:08,320
Anyone familiar with a Myers Briggs types,

243
00:13:08,321 --> 00:13:12,280
however knows this is not remotely true
and often many people retake the test

244
00:13:12,281 --> 00:13:15,340
and get a different result because
they're original result isn't applicable.

245
00:13:15,490 --> 00:13:17,880
If I had been identified as an I and Tj,

246
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:21,120
it wouldn't have been long until I or
my friends who introduced the subjects.

247
00:13:21,121 --> 00:13:23,500
I mean noticed it was an
error based on the behavior,

248
00:13:23,650 --> 00:13:26,410
especially when I was
introduced to the of functions.

249
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:30,310
It's blatantly clear that
the types referred to very
specific personality traits

250
00:13:30,311 --> 00:13:33,250
in such arguments, I believe do not
invalidate the types themselves.

251
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:38,080
It probably hint more towards a notion
now the common tests allow room for error

252
00:13:38,081 --> 00:13:38,651
and bias,

253
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:42,610
which should be closed and more questions
should be specified to produce more

254
00:13:42,611 --> 00:13:43,241
accurate results.

255
00:13:43,241 --> 00:13:47,020
Although admittedly it is true that
many online tests are more interested in

256
00:13:47,021 --> 00:13:50,860
reminded and helping people accurately
identified a type accordingly,

257
00:13:50,861 --> 00:13:54,310
I would venture to guess that these myths
types are generally off by one or two

258
00:13:54,311 --> 00:13:58,030
litters and happen because it tests
is taken without much introspection or

259
00:13:58,031 --> 00:14:01,300
seriousness.
Maybe an NFP is actually an eye NFP.

260
00:14:01,301 --> 00:14:06,070
Maybe an EST j is actually an ESF Jay,
maybe an INTP is actually an eye FGA.

261
00:14:06,130 --> 00:14:07,330
I have never once,

262
00:14:07,331 --> 00:14:09,760
and this is just my personal experience
to take with a grain of salt,

263
00:14:09,761 --> 00:14:11,500
but in the year that I've
been studying this stuff,

264
00:14:11,501 --> 00:14:15,850
I have never once encountered an
individual who mistyped as the complete

265
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:19,990
opposite type and I have no idea how our
author here managed to go from Imtj to

266
00:14:19,991 --> 00:14:20,860
ESF Pete.

267
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:25,270
That would require basically answering
completely opposites on each question and

268
00:14:25,271 --> 00:14:29,560
I accordingly have to wonder what test
was this exactly how much thought was put

269
00:14:29,561 --> 00:14:31,150
into the answering of each question.

270
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:35,680
Do people really so easily go from being
introverted, preferring abstract topics,

271
00:14:35,681 --> 00:14:38,590
making decisions based on objective
criteria and preferring structure and

272
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:41,710
organization to daily life,
to jumping to extroversion,

273
00:14:41,711 --> 00:14:44,970
preferring practical cons that I was
making decisions empathetically and with

274
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:49,980
values and preferring flexibility and
openness so easily that NBTI is useless or

275
00:14:50,810 --> 00:14:54,890
maybe were some answers intentionally
altered an aura to write this article.

276
00:14:55,130 --> 00:14:56,360
Who can say for sure,

277
00:14:56,361 --> 00:15:00,580
but quite frankly the bottom line is that
if these results were so arbitrary of

278
00:15:00,581 --> 00:15:04,280
people could not identify meaningful
correlations or statistics which have been

279
00:15:04,281 --> 00:15:07,850
proven to exist. Iq
results, income averages,

280
00:15:07,851 --> 00:15:11,810
result averages compared with the janitor
would not line up consistently and we

281
00:15:11,811 --> 00:15:15,680
would likely have each type evenly
distributed into sixteenths among the

282
00:15:15,681 --> 00:15:16,514
population.

283
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:20,750
None of this is the case in each of these
authors have little ground on which to

284
00:15:20,751 --> 00:15:21,770
make their assertions.

285
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:25,340
He then goes on to write the rest of
the article backing it up with other

286
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:28,910
misconceptions which I believe I have
addressed here such as implying that

287
00:15:28,911 --> 00:15:32,600
thinking and feeling are independent
of each other, which sure that is true,

288
00:15:32,601 --> 00:15:36,680
but how about in decision making
process thinkers can like people,

289
00:15:36,681 --> 00:15:38,090
feelers can be logical.

290
00:15:38,091 --> 00:15:41,000
It's about how people make
decisions in the interest of time.

291
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,010
If something does stick out,
which I haven't covered,

292
00:15:43,011 --> 00:15:45,500
alert me in the comments section,
I'll address it there.

293
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:49,430
Further criticism run along the same
lines. Looking at this video from vox,

294
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:51,470
which isn't itself a red flags.

295
00:15:51,490 --> 00:15:55,310
Anyone looking for an objective and valid
analysis of the topic because vox has

296
00:15:55,311 --> 00:15:58,130
a fairly decent record of making
inaccurate in shallow videos.

297
00:15:58,580 --> 00:16:01,790
They percent largely the same
incorrect arguments they claim.

298
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:05,990
Of course everyone is too special and
unique to share any identifiable traits

299
00:16:05,991 --> 00:16:10,100
and they quote Carl youngest saying every
individual is an exception to the rule

300
00:16:10,101 --> 00:16:13,610
as if this was opposed to cover literally
every aspect of the human experience

301
00:16:13,611 --> 00:16:16,310
and infer only 16 such
experience that exists.

302
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:19,430
They claim it's all a big scam to
make money off gullible people will.

303
00:16:19,431 --> 00:16:22,850
I'm not making a penny off this just
for the record and the most common tests

304
00:16:22,851 --> 00:16:24,230
are in themselves free.

305
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:28,430
They mentioned that employers use a test
to assign people into jobs and imply

306
00:16:28,431 --> 00:16:29,750
that this is an awful idea.

307
00:16:29,751 --> 00:16:34,160
Then according to their animation
and for that the Ist Jay is a mentor.

308
00:16:34,161 --> 00:16:38,090
The INTP as a manager and
the ESF Jay is an analyst.

309
00:16:38,091 --> 00:16:41,780
You may take that as you will and
other points they make is that the test

310
00:16:41,781 --> 00:16:45,950
results only give you
positive descriptions. That
really isn't entirely false.

311
00:16:45,951 --> 00:16:49,970
The websites themselves do sort of
butter people up to encourage them to get

312
00:16:49,971 --> 00:16:50,780
into it more.

313
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:55,160
But I have an a four videos I've made
addressing the 16 types criticized each

314
00:16:55,161 --> 00:16:59,180
and every type. There are traits I dislike
about every type, including my own.

315
00:16:59,181 --> 00:17:01,580
Just because of marketers don't
highlight negative aspects.

316
00:17:01,581 --> 00:17:02,990
It doesn't mean they don't exist.

317
00:17:03,170 --> 00:17:07,070
They even throw in those viral images
of the suppose the types of fictional

318
00:17:07,071 --> 00:17:09,830
characters.
If the characters are developed enough,

319
00:17:09,831 --> 00:17:12,890
fictional characters can be typed,
although it's kind of awkward to do.

320
00:17:12,890 --> 00:17:16,760
And I would like to concede that the
online community more interested in

321
00:17:16,761 --> 00:17:18,590
applying NBTI as a fad,

322
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:22,340
more like astrology than to use it
as an actual tool for understanding

323
00:17:22,341 --> 00:17:25,130
personalities do tend to degrade
the image of the subject.

324
00:17:25,370 --> 00:17:29,720
Pause where you need to. But take for
example, this should be more like this.

325
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:33,740
This should be more like this and this.
It should be more like this.

326
00:17:33,770 --> 00:17:37,970
This should be more like this,
and this just doesn't make any sense.

327
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:40,220
So to summarize a bit here,

328
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:44,600
the validity of the Myers Briggs
types lies beyond confirmation bias.

329
00:17:44,601 --> 00:17:48,680
As we can see a correlation, scientific
data, what the letters represent,

330
00:17:48,681 --> 00:17:53,010
line up a psychological data which is
either conducted specifically with Nbti

331
00:17:53,011 --> 00:17:54,990
mine or parallels with sciences,

332
00:17:54,991 --> 00:17:59,460
otherwise shown criticisms of Myers
Briggs types tend to not criticize these

333
00:17:59,461 --> 00:17:59,881
points.

334
00:17:59,881 --> 00:18:03,330
They generally just look at superficial
understanding and accordingly make

335
00:18:03,331 --> 00:18:07,470
misguided arguments. So I feel comfortable
in this analysis and critique. However,

336
00:18:07,471 --> 00:18:10,830
I have not addressed
one final major quaint.

337
00:18:11,130 --> 00:18:16,080
The fact of the matter is
most psychologists aren't
big fans of it. Well why?

338
00:18:16,081 --> 00:18:18,600
I mean it's been shown the
have scientific backing, yes.

339
00:18:18,601 --> 00:18:22,320
But psychologists have admittedly
invented better systems to categorize

340
00:18:22,321 --> 00:18:26,460
personality is a big one now that that
like is the big five and I could spend

341
00:18:26,461 --> 00:18:30,600
another 10 minutes showing
how NBTI correlates to the
big five and various ways,

342
00:18:30,601 --> 00:18:34,110
but I think that the big five in general
and other parts of psychology are a

343
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:37,350
topic for another video.
Really though Myers Briggs types,

344
00:18:37,351 --> 00:18:40,950
while they can be very useful
and revealing and build
bridges of understanding

345
00:18:40,951 --> 00:18:43,230
between people are affective mostly.

346
00:18:43,231 --> 00:18:47,850
As a general reference telling you that
I am an INTP will give you insight into

347
00:18:47,851 --> 00:18:50,640
my personality, but it's certainly
does not tell you everything.

348
00:18:50,850 --> 00:18:55,590
Knowing that someone is an I in of j or
an ESP doesn't really provide insight

349
00:18:55,591 --> 00:18:56,670
into their home life,

350
00:18:56,671 --> 00:19:00,780
their mental health or overall health
or their life experiences, their values,

351
00:19:00,781 --> 00:19:02,670
tradition or culture,
et Cetera, et cetera.

352
00:19:02,730 --> 00:19:05,010
And from a perspective of a psychologist,

353
00:19:05,011 --> 00:19:07,260
it's easy to see why it
doesn't tell them enough,

354
00:19:07,261 --> 00:19:10,770
particularly if they're
conducting research or
assisting a client in a form of

355
00:19:10,771 --> 00:19:11,670
therapy or something,

356
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:15,810
they will likely have to rely on other
systems or look at people on a more

357
00:19:15,811 --> 00:19:17,670
specific and individual level.

358
00:19:17,850 --> 00:19:21,300
So that's about all I have to say
about Myers Briggs types. For now,

359
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:25,110
I wholeheartedly welcome criticism
in the comment section and encourage

360
00:19:25,111 --> 00:19:27,000
respectful debate between viewers.

361
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:30,670
If you're looking to learn more about
NBTI have made for analysis videos in

362
00:19:30,671 --> 00:19:33,450
youtube videos explaining the letters
and cognitive functions on my channel,

363
00:19:33,451 --> 00:19:37,440
which I encourage you to check out and
for more videos on subjects like this and

364
00:19:37,441 --> 00:19:40,170
many other subjects in the future
and which I've already made,

365
00:19:40,171 --> 00:19:44,220
be sure to check off fire learning
and subscribe. Thank you for watching.
