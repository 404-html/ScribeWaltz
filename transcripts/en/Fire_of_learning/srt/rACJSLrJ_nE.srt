1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:03,570
Fire of learning presents the tale
of out in from the West fjords.

2
00:00:03,690 --> 00:00:06,960
I'll don and his thoughts are vest fierce,
go author on known,

3
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:09,090
also known as out in the bear.

4
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:13,950
There was a man named out and his family
came from the West viewers and he had

5
00:00:13,951 --> 00:00:14,640
little money.

6
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:17,910
He sailed abroad from the few words under
the supervision of a good farmer named

7
00:00:17,911 --> 00:00:21,540
Thor Stein and the skipper authority
or who have been staying with Torstein

8
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:23,760
Stein that winter.
I wouldn't had been living there too.

9
00:00:23,761 --> 00:00:26,880
Working for Thor Stein and exchange
provisions and passage abroad,

10
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:28,590
I would input most of what money.

11
00:00:28,591 --> 00:00:30,930
He had a wait for his mother
before he boarded the ship.

12
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:35,160
It was intended to pay for three
years, food and lodging. They set sail.

13
00:00:35,161 --> 00:00:38,280
Their journey went well and out and spent
the following winter with story or who

14
00:00:38,281 --> 00:00:39,480
owned a farm and more.

15
00:00:39,630 --> 00:00:43,020
The next summer they traveled to Greenland
and spent the winter. There it is,

16
00:00:43,021 --> 00:00:44,340
mentioned that out and bought a bear.

17
00:00:44,341 --> 00:00:47,310
They're a great treasure for which
he traded everything he owned.

18
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:49,830
The following summer they
sailed back to Norway.

19
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:52,500
They had a good voyage and
out and had with him his bear.

20
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:56,160
He planned the travel south to Denmark
and meet King's fine and give him the

21
00:00:56,161 --> 00:00:59,190
animal and that when he arrived in the
south of the country where the king was

22
00:00:59,191 --> 00:01:02,610
staying, he left the ship leading the
bear behind him and rented a room.

23
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:04,710
King Harold was soon told that a bear,

24
00:01:04,711 --> 00:01:07,740
a great treasure owned by an
Icelandic man had arrived there.

25
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:11,580
The king immediately sent to summon him
and when out and appeared before the

26
00:01:11,581 --> 00:01:14,550
king, he greeted him. The king
returned his greeting and asked,

27
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:18,390
do you have a great treasure of a bear?
He answered that. He did have a bear.

28
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:21,480
The king asked, what do you, some
of the animal for the same price.

29
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:24,420
You paid for it. He answered, I did
not want you to do that, my Lord.

30
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:27,900
What'd you then the king asked, let me
give you double for what you paid for it.

31
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:30,600
That would be fair if you have
traded everything you own for it.

32
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:34,620
I did not want to do that. My
Lord, he answered the king as well.

33
00:01:34,621 --> 00:01:38,820
You give it to me. Then he
answered, no, my lord making asked,

34
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:40,770
what will you do with it?
Then go,

35
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:43,800
he answered to Denmark and give it
to king's fine. King Harold said,

36
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:46,680
are you so ignorant that you have not
heard about the enmity between our

37
00:01:46,681 --> 00:01:49,590
countries or do you reckon you'd like
so great that you can go with treasures

38
00:01:49,591 --> 00:01:53,400
where others cannot travel safely even
though they do so of necessity out of

39
00:01:53,401 --> 00:01:55,200
answered my Lord,
that is in your power,

40
00:01:55,201 --> 00:01:58,080
but I will not agree to do anything
other than what I have intended.

41
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:01,980
The king then said, why not go ahead
then and go your own way as you please,

42
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:05,250
but come to see me when you return and
tell me how king's fine has awarded you

43
00:02:05,251 --> 00:02:07,890
for the bear. It may well be
that you were a fortunate man.

44
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:12,540
I promised to do that set out and he
then traveled south along the coast and

45
00:02:12,541 --> 00:02:15,090
east into Vic and from there onto Denmark,

46
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:18,870
but then I'll have his travel money was
spent and he was forced to beg for food

47
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:20,550
false for himself and for the bear.

48
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:24,460
He met a steward of the cane named Aki
and asked him for provisions for himself

49
00:02:24,461 --> 00:02:28,080
and the bear I plan,
he said to give the bare to king's fine.

50
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:31,440
Aki told him that he would sell
him provisions if you wanted,

51
00:02:31,441 --> 00:02:34,980
but out of reply that he had no money
to pay for them, I want. Nevertheless,

52
00:02:34,981 --> 00:02:37,320
he said to find a way to
take the bear because a king,

53
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:39,600
I will give you the provisions
you need to reach the king.

54
00:02:39,601 --> 00:02:42,030
But in exchange I want
to own half of the bear.

55
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:44,280
You should consider the
facts that the variable die.

56
00:02:44,281 --> 00:02:46,530
If you're not have the money
for all the food you need,

57
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:48,570
then you will not have any bear at all.

58
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:51,300
And went out and had thought about
what the Stuart had proposed.

59
00:02:51,301 --> 00:02:55,350
He found it reasonable. So they agreed
that he would sell Aki half of the bear,

60
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:58,320
and that's a king, should be the
judge of the whole arrangements later.

61
00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:00,880
Now both of them were to go
to see the king's together.

62
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:03,790
So they went to see the king
and stood before his table.

63
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:05,260
The king pondered over who?

64
00:03:05,261 --> 00:03:09,310
This man whom he did not know might
be he asked out and who are you?

65
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:12,070
He answered,
I am an Icelandic man.

66
00:03:12,071 --> 00:03:14,500
My Lord and I have just come
from Greenland and Norway.

67
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:17,610
I wants to give you this bear.
I gave everything I owned for it,

68
00:03:17,611 --> 00:03:20,230
but I have made a blunder for now.
I only own half of the bear.

69
00:03:20,770 --> 00:03:24,130
He then told the king would have taken
place between the Steward Aki and himself.

70
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:29,350
The king asked is what? He says,
True Aki. It is true. Aki replied,

71
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:30,753
the King asked,

72
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:34,210
did you think it appropriate given the
fact that I've made you a powerful man to

73
00:03:34,211 --> 00:03:37,270
impede and hinder a man from bringing
me a treasure that he's given all his

74
00:03:37,271 --> 00:03:38,110
possessions to buy?

75
00:03:38,111 --> 00:03:40,840
When King Harald thought it
advisable to give him save conduct,

76
00:03:40,841 --> 00:03:42,310
even though he is our enemy.

77
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:46,240
Now consider how fair this well on
your part why you deserve to be killed.

78
00:03:46,690 --> 00:03:47,860
I'm not going to go that far,

79
00:03:47,861 --> 00:03:51,550
but you will leave the country immediately
and never be caught in my eyesight

80
00:03:51,551 --> 00:03:53,290
again,
but you out in.

81
00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:56,530
I will think as if you had given me
the entire beer and please do stay.

82
00:03:56,890 --> 00:03:59,260
He accepted that remained
was king's fine for awhile.

83
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:01,990
After some time had passed
out and said to the king,

84
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:04,720
I am now eager to leave here.
My Lord, the king answered,

85
00:04:04,721 --> 00:04:05,800
has hesitatingly somewhat,

86
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:10,450
where do you plan to go if you do not
care to remain here with us? He applied.

87
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:12,130
I want to make a pilgrimage to Rome.

88
00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:15,400
If your plan had not been
so noble that king replied,

89
00:04:15,401 --> 00:04:17,620
your eagerness to leave here
would have displeased me.

90
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:21,130
The king then gave him a very great deal
of silver and he traveled south with a

91
00:04:21,131 --> 00:04:22,650
group of pilgrims that came,

92
00:04:22,651 --> 00:04:25,810
made all the arrangements for his journey
and asked him to come to see him when

93
00:04:25,811 --> 00:04:29,200
he returned out and then went
his way until he arrived in Rome,

94
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,960
when he had stayed there as
long as he wished he had back,

95
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:35,500
but on the way he felt terribly ill
and lots of great deal of weight.

96
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:38,470
All of the money that king of given
him for the journey was used up.

97
00:04:38,471 --> 00:04:41,110
So he was reduced to vagrancy
and had to beg for food.

98
00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:43,030
He grew bald and was quite miserable.

99
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:46,570
He arrived back in Denmark at Easter
and went to where the king was staying

100
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,550
because he did not dare
show himself in public.

101
00:04:48,850 --> 00:04:51,790
He waited in a wing of the church and
plants and meet the king as he walked into

102
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:55,270
church that evening. But when he saw
the king and his men all dressed up,

103
00:04:55,271 --> 00:04:57,220
he could not bring himself
to appear before them.

104
00:04:57,460 --> 00:05:00,370
When the king went to feast in
the hall out and was fed outside,

105
00:05:00,371 --> 00:05:03,580
as is the custom was Kellgren's while
they still bear their staff and script.

106
00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:07,780
Now that evening when the king went to
vespers out in plan to talk with them,

107
00:05:08,290 --> 00:05:11,170
but as much as he had hesitated before,
he did so even more.

108
00:05:11,170 --> 00:05:14,350
Now when the king's men were drunk,
as they walked back inside the king,

109
00:05:14,351 --> 00:05:17,110
notice a man who seems not to
have the courage to approach them.

110
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:21,250
So when his men had got inside, the king
turned and said, let him come forward.

111
00:05:21,251 --> 00:05:25,480
Now he who wishes to speak to me, I have
a suspicion that you must be the man.

112
00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:28,570
Then Alan came forward and fell down
with the king's feet with a king,

113
00:05:28,571 --> 00:05:32,080
scarcely recognize them. As soon as
it king realized who he was though,

114
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:35,400
he took out his hand and welcomed him.
You have changed much.

115
00:05:35,401 --> 00:05:37,960
He said since we last met
and he let them inside,

116
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:42,250
not when the king's men saw him. They
laughed at him, but the king said,

117
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:46,090
you have no costs a laugh or he has a
better provided for assault and you have

118
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:49,830
the king then had a bath prepared for
him and gave him clothing out and remains

119
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:52,630
there with him. It is told that
sometime during the spring,

120
00:05:52,631 --> 00:05:56,080
the king invited out and to remain with
him permanently and told him he would

121
00:05:56,081 --> 00:06:00,220
make him his cup there and honor
him highly out and said, God reward.

122
00:06:00,221 --> 00:06:02,750
Do you my lord for all the
honor you would bestow upon me.

123
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:06,470
But as a matter of fact, I'm thinking
of sailing to Iceland. The king replied,

124
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:10,430
that seems an odd choice out and said,
I cannot live with the fact that my Lord,

125
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:12,230
that I am held in honor here with you.

126
00:06:12,231 --> 00:06:16,220
While my mother is a vagrant in Iceland
for the provisions I left for her before

127
00:06:16,221 --> 00:06:19,340
I sailed from Iceland will now
be exhausted. The king replied,

128
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:22,880
that was well and nobody put, and you
will turn out to be a fortunate man.

129
00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:25,760
That reason alone could make you're
leaving here acceptable to me.

130
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:30,890
Stay with me now until a
ship has prepared. And so
he did one late spring day,

131
00:06:30,891 --> 00:06:32,560
king's fine walk downs,
the docks.

132
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:35,000
Remember preparing shifts to
sail to various countries,

133
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,730
to the Baltic and sax and
eats to Sweden and Norway.

134
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:41,000
He went out and came upon a beautiful
ship that was being outfitted.

135
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:46,040
The king asked, how do you like this ship
out in? He answered very well. My Lord,

136
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:47,173
the king said,

137
00:06:47,570 --> 00:06:51,110
I want to give you this ship as repayment
for the bear out and thanked him for

138
00:06:51,111 --> 00:06:53,990
the ship as best he could.
After a while when the ship was ready,

139
00:06:53,991 --> 00:06:55,490
King's fine said to Auten.

140
00:06:55,730 --> 00:06:57,950
Now you wish to leave and I
am not going to hinder you,

141
00:06:58,190 --> 00:07:01,700
but I have heard that your country is
poorly provided with harbors and that in

142
00:07:01,701 --> 00:07:05,180
many places there was only open
coastline which is dangerous for ships.

143
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:08,060
Now say you are shipwrecked and
he lose you're shipping goods,

144
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:11,450
then you will have little a show that
you have met king's finding given him a

145
00:07:11,451 --> 00:07:12,140
treasure.

146
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:15,620
The king then gave him a leather pouch
full of silver so that she won't be left

147
00:07:15,621 --> 00:07:19,250
entirely penniless. If you are a ship's
racks, if you manage to hold onto this,

148
00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:23,390
it could still happen. The king continued
it that you lose this too little good.

149
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:26,270
Would it do then that you have met
king spine and given him a treasure,

150
00:07:26,570 --> 00:07:29,390
the king's injury or ring off his
arm and gave it to Adam and said,

151
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:32,690
even if things turned out so badly that
you were shipped right to any lose this

152
00:07:32,691 --> 00:07:36,890
money, you will not be painless if you
make it ashore for many survive shipwrecks

153
00:07:36,891 --> 00:07:40,250
wearing gold and it will still be
evident that you have met king's fine.

154
00:07:40,251 --> 00:07:41,690
If you hold onto the armoring,

155
00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:46,220
I would advise you though he said not to
give the armoring away unless you feel

156
00:07:46,221 --> 00:07:50,000
you must repay a very great favor done
to you by a noble man. In that case,

157
00:07:50,001 --> 00:07:53,630
give that man the armoring four it would
be fit men of high standing to accept

158
00:07:53,631 --> 00:07:58,631
it now farewell out and then set sail on
a ride in Norway where he had his cargo

159
00:07:58,671 --> 00:07:59,570
carried to shore.

160
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:02,930
This was a greater chore than it had
been the last time he was in Norway.

161
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:06,770
He then went to see king Harald to keep
the promise he had made him before he

162
00:08:06,771 --> 00:08:10,370
sailed to Denmark. He greeted
the king warmly. King Harald,

163
00:08:10,371 --> 00:08:13,640
return his greeting and said, sit
down and drink with us, and so he did.

164
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,370
King Harald then asked,

165
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:19,970
how did king's Fund reward you for the
bear out in replied by accepting the gift

166
00:08:19,971 --> 00:08:22,760
from me. That king said,
why I would have done that.

167
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:24,950
What else did he give you for it?
I would in replied,

168
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,470
he gave me silver so that
I could make a pilgrimage.

169
00:08:27,890 --> 00:08:32,000
Thinking Harold said kings fine gives
many men's silver for pilgrimages and for

170
00:08:32,001 --> 00:08:35,060
other things, even when they did
not bring him treasures. Now,

171
00:08:35,061 --> 00:08:36,020
what else did he give you?

172
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:40,640
He offered out in reply to make me as
cup bearer to bestow high honors upon me.

173
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:42,260
A nice gesture said to king,

174
00:08:42,261 --> 00:08:45,200
but surely he gives you
something more out in replied,

175
00:08:45,290 --> 00:08:48,470
he gave me a nor with goods,
mostly highly desired here in Norway.

176
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:51,890
Graciously done so they king and I
would have rewarded you. Likewise,

177
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:54,320
they give you anything else.
I don't replied.

178
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:57,600
He gave me another pouch full of silver
and said that I will not be painless.

179
00:08:57,630 --> 00:09:01,440
Even if my shipper wrecked off the coast
of Iceland, the king said splendid.

180
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,150
Even I would not have done that.

181
00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:06,210
I would've considered myself free from
obligation. After giving you the ship,

182
00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:10,800
did he give you anything
else? He did indeed. Give me
more of my lord out. Instead,

183
00:09:11,310 --> 00:09:14,370
he gave me the armoring that I wear on
my arm and told me that all my money

184
00:09:14,371 --> 00:09:17,940
could be lost. But that I still would
not be painless, even if I have the ring.

185
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:21,540
He told me not to give it to anyone else
unless I felt obliged to repay a noble

186
00:09:21,541 --> 00:09:25,080
man so daily that I would be willing to
part with it until I have now found that

187
00:09:25,081 --> 00:09:29,640
man, for you have the power to deprive
me of both the bear ans my life hit you.

188
00:09:29,641 --> 00:09:32,340
Let me travel and piece to a
place where others could not go.

189
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:36,600
The king warmly accepted the gift and
gave out and find gifts in return before

190
00:09:36,601 --> 00:09:39,660
they parted out instead of sight as
money for the journey to Iceland and

191
00:09:39,661 --> 00:09:43,560
traveled there early that summer, he was
considered an exceedingly fortunate man.

192
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:48,290

from this man out in translated by Anstey

193
