1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:05,490
Ireland. The island takes its name
from the old Irish word [inaudible],

2
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:10,020
the name of a goddess,
a word meaning bouncing or prosperous.

3
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:14,760
The people of this island have ancient
roots to it and its history is likewise

4
00:00:14,761 --> 00:00:19,500
long, rich, mysterious and
important, not only for the Irish,

5
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:23,760
but for the millions of people living
across the world whose ancestors came from

6
00:00:23,761 --> 00:00:25,410
this island.
In this video,

7
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:28,380
we're going to discuss the
history of Ireland and fall,

8
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:32,370
the story of druids and Christians,
rebels and loyalists,

9
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:35,880
natives and the invaders
struggles and successes,

10
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:38,490
all of which made
Ireland what it is today.

11
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:47,870
It's likely that Ireland was first
inhabited around the year 12,500 BC by a

12
00:00:48,141 --> 00:00:50,520
hunter gatherer groups.
During this time,

13
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:54,960
sea levels were lower and Ireland belonged
to continental Europe. Geographically.

14
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:56,790
By 4,000 BC,

15
00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:00,660
farming had likely made its way to
the island and become commonplace.

16
00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:05,990
Ireland entered the bronze age around
2000 BC being in a fortunate location for

17
00:01:06,361 --> 00:01:10,770
this age as it was heavy and copper
and near Cornwall, which produced him.

18
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:13,350
The Iron Age began around 600 BC.

19
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:18,510
It is during the Iron Age that Ireland's
modern identity begins to take shape as

20
00:01:18,511 --> 00:01:22,680
Celtic peoples from mainland Europe and
Britain began migrating to the island

21
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:27,690
and mixing with the indigenous population.
Prior to the arrival of the Celts,

22
00:01:27,691 --> 00:01:31,140
Ireland was very sparsely
inhabited and unorganized.

23
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:34,650
The Celts would bring it on it's
path toward higher civilization.

24
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:38,220
For such main waves of Celtic
migrations would occur.

25
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:42,540
It was the Celts who had brought the
Iron Age to Ireland along with religion

26
00:01:42,541 --> 00:01:46,260
that would form the basis of the
paganism of the British isles language,

27
00:01:46,261 --> 00:01:49,800
which would evolve into the modern
Irish language trade connections,

28
00:01:49,801 --> 00:01:53,850
the main continent and his
social structure and culture
which would dominate the

29
00:01:53,851 --> 00:01:55,050
island for centuries.

30
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:59,280
The first writings of the island come
from the Greek and Roman explorers who

31
00:01:59,281 --> 00:02:03,690
referred to the island under a variety
of names and made a number of reports

32
00:02:03,691 --> 00:02:04,590
about the island.

33
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:09,090
Though many of these reports were
likely false and a time is fantastical.

34
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:13,260
They would last and the Roman impressions
of the island giving ancient Ireland

35
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:15,780
and the Celts in general,
a mysterious aura,

36
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:18,750
which truth be told lasts to this day.
In a way.

37
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:23,100
The first person to actually give a
fairly accurate report of the island was

38
00:02:23,101 --> 00:02:24,930
Julius Caesar who called the island.

39
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:28,620
He Barnea a corruption of the
ancient Greek word for the island,

40
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:32,520
the land of the [inaudible], which
would come to mean the land of winter,

41
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:34,890
sharing a common route
with the word hibernaid.

42
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:39,810
Caesar also said that it was located to
the west of Brittania and about half its

43
00:02:39,811 --> 00:02:43,830
size, one of the most accurate
descriptions of Ireland up to that point.

44
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:48,840
Those some Romans like a
Greek law considered it the
Romans would never invade

45
00:02:48,841 --> 00:02:49,800
he baron Ya.
What?

46
00:02:49,801 --> 00:02:53,970
They did interact primarily because of
Rome's presence on the island of Britain.

47
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:59,160
Archeological findings of Roman coins
on Ireland suggests complex interaction

48
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:00,003
and trade.

49
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:03,880
It's possible that the Romans set up
trading up posts in certain areas of

50
00:03:03,881 --> 00:03:08,050
Ireland and perhaps military outposts
with the purpose of protecting his trade.

51
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:11,200
One such commodity which they
traded would've been slaves.

52
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:15,070
The Romans no doubt purchased them from
the Irish to work on the agricultural

53
00:03:15,071 --> 00:03:16,360
centers of Roman Britain.

54
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:20,740
It is likely that the Irish took
part in Roman conflicts as barbarian

55
00:03:20,741 --> 00:03:24,700
mercenaries, which was common in the Roman
empire, especially in the later years.

56
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:29,080
They also likely were at times Raiders
in pirates who assaulted the western

57
00:03:29,081 --> 00:03:33,430
coast of or Tanya, but also settled
it. Rome would never invade.

58
00:03:33,431 --> 00:03:35,260
He Beronia for two main reasons.

59
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:39,220
The first was that there wasn't a
major tactical advantage in doing so.

60
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:42,700
It was unknown territory on
the border of the known world.

61
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:46,720
It would have been very complicated
trying to subdue the island and the Romans

62
00:03:46,721 --> 00:03:51,190
weren't sure what they
gain from it economically,
strategically or politically.

63
00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:52,443
Accordingly,

64
00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:57,160
resources and manpower were better
utilized slightly east against the pics of

65
00:03:57,161 --> 00:04:01,450
modern Scotland. The moment Rome moved
troops from Britannia to Hibernia,

66
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:04,660
the pics would likely seize
the opportunity and attack.

67
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:08,530
If Rome had ruled the whole island, maybe
they would've gone to Ireland as well.

68
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:12,220
Though we'll never know though there
was interaction with the Romans.

69
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:16,720
Ireland was one of the few areas of
western Europe which was allowed primarily

70
00:04:16,721 --> 00:04:19,030
to develop on its own.
During this time,

71
00:04:19,031 --> 00:04:23,620
the Irish relied on small communities
of subsistence farming where kettle or

72
00:04:23,621 --> 00:04:27,340
sometimes other goods like slaves
were essentially the form of currency.

73
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:31,810
In some writings it is said that one
slave girl was equal in worth to about six

74
00:04:31,811 --> 00:04:34,270
cows.
They lacked major towns and cities,

75
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:37,210
but they did have early kinds
of towns and roads between them.

76
00:04:37,330 --> 00:04:41,050
Even through bogs and marshes.
The island was, as I said,

77
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:44,410
divided among many different tribes
who are often at war with each other.

78
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,940
A main cause of warfare.

79
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:49,660
These cattle primarily disputes over
ownership and the theft of them.

80
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:53,380
The Celts introduced new power structures
to Ireland when they came and there

81
00:04:53,381 --> 00:04:57,070
would have been perhaps a hundred to
200 kings across Ireland really in their

82
00:04:57,071 --> 00:05:00,850
own small countries due to the land
differences in the various tribes,

83
00:05:00,851 --> 00:05:04,120
four distinct regions would
form in Ireland holster,

84
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:09,270
lanster monster and conduct these
divisions dating back to ancient times.

85
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:10,570
Last to this day,

86
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:14,680
the final and most notable group of Celts
were the gales who's influenced would

87
00:05:14,681 --> 00:05:18,430
eventually extend across the whole island
and even the parts of western Scotland

88
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:19,450
in the fifth century.

89
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:23,560
Their culture and identity would be
firmly rooted and permanence in Ireland.

90
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:24,640
To this day,

91
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:29,320
the Irish language calls itself gala guy
and in English the word Gaelic is still

92
00:05:29,321 --> 00:05:31,870
synonymous with the people
and culture of Ireland,

93
00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:35,860
though they did right using an Ogun
writing system on stones and wood,

94
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:40,000
the Irish at this time lacked books and
literature. There are pagan religion,

95
00:05:40,030 --> 00:05:43,270
which was banned by Rome and
modern England thrive there.

96
00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:46,720
We don't know a lot about this religion
from their perspective or much about

97
00:05:46,721 --> 00:05:50,290
their home and people in this time in
general because of their lack of extensive

98
00:05:50,291 --> 00:05:50,830
writing.

99
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:54,760
Much of what we know comes from the
Greeks and Romans and centuries later

100
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:58,610
Christian monks who recorded tales,
which were preserved verbally,

101
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:02,780
naturally the Romans who sought to
convince their people that they had to

102
00:06:02,781 --> 00:06:05,870
conquer the Celts and the
Christians who sought to converse.

103
00:06:05,871 --> 00:06:10,190
The pagans are considered the
most reliable or honest sources.

104
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:13,550
Thankfully, however important
parts of this time survived,

105
00:06:13,551 --> 00:06:17,330
which along with archeology allows
us to understand them better.

106
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:19,400
The Irish Celts were animistic.

107
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:23,450
They saw spirits in the natural world
around them so that it's trees, water,

108
00:06:23,451 --> 00:06:24,890
rocks, animals. Fire,

109
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:28,910
etc. And thus had a deep spiritual
connection to the natural world.

110
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:32,150
They worshiped many gods
and spirits somewhere local.

111
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:34,370
Others were coming across Celtic culture.

112
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:38,720
They believed in an other world which
could have meant many different things

113
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:43,010
though was primarily in afterlife,
a world of spirits and the dead.

114
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:46,220
Some said it existed at
the West across the sea.

115
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:48,950
Others said it ran
parallel to our own world,

116
00:06:49,010 --> 00:06:53,840
sometimes the barriers between his world
and the other world or broken leading

117
00:06:53,841 --> 00:06:58,841
to a number of strange events to interpret
this complex religion where the dri

118
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:03,530
known in English as a Jewish,
the druids were not only priests,

119
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:07,940
but also legal authorities, leaders,
philosophers, historians and doctors.

120
00:07:08,030 --> 00:07:11,960
Oftentimes they held as much power
as the king's whom they advised.

121
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:16,040
One of the more shocking aspects of
this paganism was human sacrifice.

122
00:07:16,130 --> 00:07:20,210
They'll Roman sources likely exaggerated
the amount of human sacrifice occurring

123
00:07:20,211 --> 00:07:24,770
at the time it was present in Pagan
Ireland before Roman contact and likely

124
00:07:24,771 --> 00:07:27,440
still continued after it.
The details of it, however,

125
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:31,910
are unclear because the Irish was somewhat
isolated from both Rome and the rest

126
00:07:31,911 --> 00:07:36,230
of the world. Irish society was not
fractured when the empire began to fall.

127
00:07:36,410 --> 00:07:37,130
In fact,

128
00:07:37,130 --> 00:07:41,450
rather the Irish saw an opportunity in
a collapsing Roman Britain and began

129
00:07:41,451 --> 00:07:44,390
raids on it. Nevertheless,
Rome's religion.

130
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:46,790
Christianity would not only outlive it,

131
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:50,570
but would spread rapidly to centuries
following its collapse with Ireland,

132
00:07:50,571 --> 00:07:51,650
right in its sights.

133
00:07:51,710 --> 00:07:55,460
Christianity would transform Ireland and
connect it to the rest of the world and

134
00:07:55,461 --> 00:07:57,740
important ways and the man would bring it.

135
00:07:57,741 --> 00:08:02,300
There was first the Romano Britain
teenager captured as a slave by the Irish

136
00:08:02,330 --> 00:08:05,720
named souk. It better known by
his Christian name. Patrick.

137
00:08:10,730 --> 00:08:13,760
There are a number of details
missing from Saint Patrick's life,

138
00:08:13,761 --> 00:08:18,440
such as when and where exactly he was
born and while many details have been

139
00:08:18,441 --> 00:08:22,730
filled in with myths, historians agree
widely that he was a real person.

140
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:27,620
Patrick was Levy born in Wales or western
England in the late fourth century at

141
00:08:27,621 --> 00:08:32,120
the age of 16 he was captured by Irish
Raiders and taken back to Ireland where

142
00:08:32,121 --> 00:08:36,710
he worked as an enslaved to shepherd for
six years until he escaped and returned

143
00:08:36,711 --> 00:08:39,860
back to per Tanya.
During his enslavement.

144
00:08:39,890 --> 00:08:44,000
He held on to something which he
formerly hadn't cared about much his home

145
00:08:44,001 --> 00:08:47,060
religion, Christianity.
Upon returning home,

146
00:08:47,090 --> 00:08:51,050
he joined the church studying and working
throughout France and Britain until

147
00:08:51,051 --> 00:08:55,070
his piety and dedication earned him an
important assignment from the pope to

148
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:59,700
travel back to Ireland and spread
Christianity there. Patrick, of course,

149
00:08:59,701 --> 00:09:03,390
had plenty of reason not to go back to
the country which had made him a slave,

150
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:08,100
but also in his eyes, plenty of reason
to do so. He knew the Irish language.

151
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:12,060
He knew how the people worked. He knew
how the religion work, and above all,

152
00:09:12,090 --> 00:09:15,900
he claimed to have received a vision
from God and a dream commanding him to

153
00:09:15,901 --> 00:09:20,310
return. Patrick wouldn't be the
first or only missionary to Ireland,

154
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:23,880
but it was for these reasons that
he'd likely be the most effective,

155
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:25,140
so he went forward with it.

156
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:28,230
He returned to Ireland and though
the Irish were not fond of him,

157
00:09:28,231 --> 00:09:32,490
he was able to escape or talk his way
out of becoming slaves again or killed or

158
00:09:32,491 --> 00:09:35,940
something of that nature. Though in
multiple incidents he came close.

159
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:41,130
The Irish particularly at kings and the
druids were not fond of Patrick coming

160
00:09:41,131 --> 00:09:45,000
and stirring things up due
to the importance of religion
in his time period in

161
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:46,920
Ireland.
He was humble and generous,

162
00:09:46,921 --> 00:09:51,921
which ease concerns that this was an
attempt to grab power despite opposition.

163
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:56,280
Patrick is said to have converted and
baptize thousands of people and he

164
00:09:56,281 --> 00:09:59,640
ordained priest who would go on
to found a monasteries of Ireland.

165
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:02,700
He has said to a performed
a number of miracles,

166
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:07,590
most of them probably metaphorical such
as driving up the snakes of Ireland and

167
00:10:07,591 --> 00:10:10,350
converting Celtic warriors
who are hundreds of years old.

168
00:10:10,890 --> 00:10:15,810
He used nature which was already deeply
a part of Irish life to help the Irish

169
00:10:15,811 --> 00:10:17,280
understand Christianity.

170
00:10:17,370 --> 00:10:21,060
He also mitigated conversion by arguing
that the values of the Irish had a

171
00:10:21,061 --> 00:10:25,140
greater place in Christianity
and converted some of
their customs and practices

172
00:10:25,141 --> 00:10:26,190
into Christian ones.

173
00:10:26,490 --> 00:10:30,810
One of the most notable examples of this
practice though not directly from Saint

174
00:10:30,810 --> 00:10:34,740
Patrick, was turning the Pagan holiday
of saw one into the Christian holiday of

175
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:38,910
Halloween. Patrick would continue his
work in Ireland until the end of his life.

176
00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:42,990
The importance of this was not only
that the Irish change religions,

177
00:10:43,290 --> 00:10:48,240
it in fact sparked a revolution in Irish
society by connecting it with the rest

178
00:10:48,241 --> 00:10:52,200
of Europe. As the dark ages began
to creep over Europe and event,

179
00:10:52,201 --> 00:10:56,190
which you can learn about in detail
in my dark ages, documentary Ireland,

180
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:59,610
which was formerly regarded
as a backward and dark place,

181
00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:04,650
actually became an area of enlightenment
and preservation of learning at a time

182
00:11:04,651 --> 00:11:07,830
when only 1% of the European
population could read.

183
00:11:08,190 --> 00:11:12,090
The monasteries in Ireland
worked diligently and
preserving the written works of

184
00:11:12,091 --> 00:11:15,150
Europe and spreading
education and enlightenment.

185
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:19,110
They did this to such a degree that
many came from Britain and the European

186
00:11:19,111 --> 00:11:22,890
mainland to study in Ireland.
Not only were these works in Latin,

187
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:27,780
but they also wrote in Irish and unusual
habit as Latin was generally preferred

188
00:11:27,781 --> 00:11:29,370
to the vernacular throughout Europe.

189
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:32,430
Though gradually becoming
United under Christianity,

190
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:35,280
Arland was still not unified as a nation,

191
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:38,850
nor would it be throughout
the Middle Ages and the fifth,

192
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:43,710
sixth and seventh centuries.
However larger kingdoms
began arising on the island,

193
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:47,430
such as monster would Kannok and Meath.
However,

194
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:49,980
they were not nation
states as we have now,

195
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:54,100
nor would they really actually kingdoms
because there was a sense that the land

196
00:11:54,101 --> 00:11:59,070
belongs to the tribe, not the kings. They
were really groups made up of loosely.

197
00:11:59,071 --> 00:12:03,920
You netted clans, tribes and families,
which they called a two Aha plural, of to,

198
00:12:03,921 --> 00:12:08,920
uh, one of the most powerful families in
Ireland at the time where the nail that

199
00:12:08,921 --> 00:12:13,590
ascendance of Nile, of the nine hostages,
one of the first great kings of Ireland,

200
00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:15,580
a figure of both myth and fact,

201
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:20,020
this family would dominate much of the
Norris governing the life of the Irish

202
00:12:20,021 --> 00:12:22,540
were the Breton laws
are unique set of laws,

203
00:12:22,541 --> 00:12:27,190
which the Irish said we're as old as the
rocks and which would seem unusual to

204
00:12:27,191 --> 00:12:30,460
us as they weren't enforced
by kings or state authorities,

205
00:12:30,670 --> 00:12:32,020
nor were they made by them.

206
00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:36,970
They were kind of held commonly the
brands which were illegal authorities in a

207
00:12:36,971 --> 00:12:40,990
sense, acted more like mediators
that are modern judges.

208
00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:43,660
Laws apply to everyone and in fact,

209
00:12:43,661 --> 00:12:46,480
at times the wealthier and
more powerful you were,

210
00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:48,340
the more you paid for your crimes.

211
00:12:48,490 --> 00:12:51,790
Early Ireland place great
emphasis on the family and tribe,

212
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:56,050
much less individualistic than the
modern west and thus the families of

213
00:12:56,051 --> 00:13:00,640
criminals where sometimes liable for
certain crimes at least financially and

214
00:13:00,641 --> 00:13:04,180
would have to compensate the
alienated family if found guilty.

215
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:06,520
Though these laws were very ancient,

216
00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:10,870
they were effective and very organized
and they actually do not necessarily fade

217
00:13:10,871 --> 00:13:13,390
into a better legal
system as we shall see.

218
00:13:13,690 --> 00:13:18,340
Rather they meet the disapproval of the
English at the centers of these kingdoms

219
00:13:18,341 --> 00:13:22,840
were actually the monasteries and a
society still lacking major cities.

220
00:13:23,050 --> 00:13:26,680
Monasteries were not only places
of religion learning and study,

221
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:30,610
but gradually became places of
economic and political power.

222
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:35,260
The church and this time period had no
reserves about getting involved in wars

223
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:37,390
and in fact monasteries in Ireland.

224
00:13:37,390 --> 00:13:40,090
We're not only responsible
for taking part in wars,

225
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:44,560
but at times directing them against
each other. Wars remained common,

226
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:49,920
all able bodied males except for the well
educated and the priests were expected

227
00:13:50,021 --> 00:13:54,250
to be available to fight for the Kings
in times of war. At this time as well,

228
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:57,640
came to miss, began forming in
England, Wales and Scotland,

229
00:13:57,790 --> 00:14:01,720
many of those in England where the
formations of the Anglo Saxons Group of

230
00:14:01,721 --> 00:14:05,530
barbarians from northern Central Europe
who gradually began taking over the

231
00:14:05,531 --> 00:14:06,790
remains of Roman Britain,

232
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:10,300
laying the foundations for what
will become eventually England.

233
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:14,620
These Anglo Saxons were along with
the pics of Scotland to the north,

234
00:14:14,710 --> 00:14:15,580
still pagan.

235
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:20,530
Adding an ironic reversal of roles from
the Roman era as now Ireland was a seed

236
00:14:20,531 --> 00:14:22,270
of Christianity in the British isles.

237
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:26,380
The Irish who were religiously active
throughout Europe got to work on

238
00:14:26,381 --> 00:14:29,140
converting their neighbors
from the Kingdom of Doll Rita,

239
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:31,420
which spanned both Ireland and Scotland.

240
00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:36,370
Irish missionaries such as
Columbia ventured into the
dark pagan wild to convert

241
00:14:36,371 --> 00:14:37,840
pick fund to Christianity.

242
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:41,580
It's worth mentioning also that this
was not yet Scotland. The names.

243
00:14:41,581 --> 00:14:46,330
Scotland is actually an English misnomer,
which comes from the Latin Scotty,

244
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:51,040
which actually referred to the gales and
later the gales living in Scotland and

245
00:14:51,050 --> 00:14:54,350
then all of Scotland.
In other words to Scotty were Irish.

246
00:14:54,770 --> 00:14:59,090
Columbia would have great success
here and would found the powerful and

247
00:14:59,091 --> 00:15:00,620
important Abby on Iona.

248
00:15:00,950 --> 00:15:04,850
Another important I wish figure of this
age was Colombani who's set up a number

249
00:15:04,851 --> 00:15:06,320
of monasteries in Europe.

250
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:10,670
Debate exists about the
legitimacy of the term dark ages,

251
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:13,880
especially relative to the
darkness of other ages,

252
00:15:13,970 --> 00:15:17,330
regardless of the darkness of this
era compared to others. However,

253
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:22,460
Ireland was one of the brightest places
to be in the first part of the early

254
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:25,040
Middle Ages in the late
18th and early 19th century.

255
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:29,600
That would be going to change as Ireland
still continued in this era and even as

256
00:15:29,601 --> 00:15:34,550
much of western Europe was crawling out
of illiteracy and intellectual decline

257
00:15:34,551 --> 00:15:38,840
under Charlemagne. New threats from
outside Chris and them began to close in.

258
00:15:38,990 --> 00:15:43,460
The greatest threat and impediment to
the Irish were the vikings. As you know,

259
00:15:43,461 --> 00:15:46,970
if you've seen my other videos
including my documentary on the Vikings,

260
00:15:47,090 --> 00:15:51,320
the Vikings had a major effect on
Europe and Ireland was no exception.

261
00:15:51,530 --> 00:15:54,860
They came first as Raiders,
plunderers and murderers,

262
00:15:54,890 --> 00:15:59,390
but later as we shall see,
they became builders and creators.

263
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:04,660
The first attack on Ireland came in the
year seven 95 on Rathlin island near

264
00:16:05,151 --> 00:16:07,340
Antrum Modern Day Northern Ireland.

265
00:16:07,610 --> 00:16:11,330
The Vikings attacked the church on the
island, plundered what they could kill.

266
00:16:11,331 --> 00:16:16,130
The monks burned everything and left a
trend which was consistent throughout the

267
00:16:16,131 --> 00:16:16,964
Viking age.

268
00:16:17,030 --> 00:16:21,500
Similar to the famous raids on Lindisfarne
just two years earlier, though,

269
00:16:21,501 --> 00:16:23,630
these were not the same group of Vikings.

270
00:16:24,110 --> 00:16:28,070
While Danish vikings prefer to focus
on Britain and Charlemagne's empire,

271
00:16:28,310 --> 00:16:33,200
those who concentrated on Ireland where
at first likely Norwegians Ireland,

272
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:38,060
much like Britain occupied a very
unfortunate position and the Viking age.

273
00:16:38,510 --> 00:16:43,190
It was an island and the vikings were
masters sailors that the vikings would

274
00:16:43,191 --> 00:16:47,960
attack other notable locations that year
under the rule of Irishmen such as Iona

275
00:16:47,990 --> 00:16:51,050
and inish. Marie in the late
18th and early 19th century,

276
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:53,990
viking raids on Ireland weren't constant.

277
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:58,490
They were perhaps only once or a few times
a year with some years not seeing any

278
00:16:58,491 --> 00:17:00,830
viking activity at all.
Nevertheless,

279
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:03,470
the raid struck fear into
the hearts of the Irish.

280
00:17:03,650 --> 00:17:07,790
The vikings could attack without warning
almost anywhere on the island from out

281
00:17:07,791 --> 00:17:08,570
of nowhere.

282
00:17:08,570 --> 00:17:13,040
A group of large ferocious warriors from
a strange unknown country across the

283
00:17:13,041 --> 00:17:17,420
sea could descend upon your village and
you could lose your home, your family,

284
00:17:17,421 --> 00:17:20,330
and your own life.
They spared no one.

285
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:23,750
There was no bargaining with them
and little means stopping them.

286
00:17:23,930 --> 00:17:25,100
It took some time,

287
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:28,910
but the Irish eventually began responding
to this threat and began being the

288
00:17:28,911 --> 00:17:29,421
vikings.

289
00:17:29,421 --> 00:17:33,980
Around 30 years after their presence
was first felt though disrupting Irish

290
00:17:33,981 --> 00:17:38,480
society. The true permanent mark on
Ireland came and the Vikings arrived.

291
00:17:38,481 --> 00:17:39,350
Not the raid,

292
00:17:39,590 --> 00:17:43,570
but to settle the process of a
heavier Viking presence on Ireland.

293
00:17:43,610 --> 00:17:48,610
Begin at eight 37 with events centered
around a viking named [inaudible] who is

294
00:17:48,801 --> 00:17:50,280
said have married a witch,

295
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:54,690
performed pagan rituals on Christian
altars and committed a number of

296
00:17:54,691 --> 00:17:57,570
atrocities.
Though his existence as uncertain.

297
00:17:57,690 --> 00:18:02,690
One of the first major settlements was
that of Dublin and eight 41 Dublin,

298
00:18:03,030 --> 00:18:07,620
which in Irish means black pool would
serve as the most important Viking

299
00:18:07,621 --> 00:18:10,620
stronghold in Ireland. What are
the most important, in fact,

300
00:18:10,621 --> 00:18:14,580
and the British isles and would later
evolve into Ireland's capitol city of

301
00:18:14,581 --> 00:18:16,350
Dublin,
along with Dublin.

302
00:18:16,410 --> 00:18:20,340
The Vikings would also be responsible for
founding a number of other major Irish

303
00:18:20,341 --> 00:18:25,170
cities such as Waterford, Limerick,
Cork, and Wexford from these bases.

304
00:18:25,290 --> 00:18:27,810
Viking terror on the
British isles intensified.

305
00:18:27,930 --> 00:18:31,350
This period is remembered
in Irish as Kaga Godell.

306
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:34,440
Regardless the war of the
Irish with the foreigners,

307
00:18:34,890 --> 00:18:39,060
the vikings came at an ideal time as
this was when the nail and the north and

308
00:18:39,061 --> 00:18:40,560
the monster Irish and itself,

309
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:45,240
we're involved in a conflict preventing
a unified resistance to them. At first,

310
00:18:45,510 --> 00:18:47,310
cooperative resistance would come though,

311
00:18:47,490 --> 00:18:52,470
and then eight 45 it is recorded that
the king of mead mailshake nail captured

312
00:18:52,471 --> 00:18:54,300
Thor guests and drowned him.
Hey,

313
00:18:54,301 --> 00:18:57,660
United Irish effort was
repelling Viking incursions,

314
00:18:57,690 --> 00:19:00,570
saving Ireland from
complete North's domination.

315
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:05,280
Though Norse men continue to move into
Ireland, including now Danish Vikings,

316
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:08,760
the death of thorniest or
an equivalent great victory.

317
00:19:08,790 --> 00:19:10,110
It again remains uncertain,

318
00:19:10,290 --> 00:19:15,120
disrupted and organized invasion and
the round the year aid 50 as civil war

319
00:19:15,121 --> 00:19:17,340
erupted between two groups of Vikings,

320
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:20,670
one side who in the Irish
called the white foreigners,

321
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:25,530
possibly Norwegians led by a viking
known as a off the white and the black

322
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:29,970
foreigners, possibly the Danish led
by Viking that the Irish called Emr,

323
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,740
possibly Ivonne a boneless,

324
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:35,580
the same viking who would later be one
of the leaders of the great heathen army.

325
00:19:35,970 --> 00:19:38,940
The Irish were not only glad
to see this division erupt,

326
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:43,050
but also took part in it with
some like mailshake nail fighting.

327
00:19:43,051 --> 00:19:45,810
What was in his eyes,
a holy war of expulsion.

328
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:50,190
Another group important in this conflict
where the high burden north or north

329
00:19:50,191 --> 00:19:55,080
scales or group of people of both Irish
and Norris heritage resulting from Irish

330
00:19:55,081 --> 00:19:56,760
and viking interaction and marriage.

331
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:00,990
Their existence was a sign of
Viking permanence on Ireland.

332
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:05,610
The vikings eventually ended the civil
war and announced a joint rule of Dublin

333
00:20:05,611 --> 00:20:08,610
and eight 57 in the eyes of many Irish,

334
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,710
the vikings would now be harder to budge.

335
00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:15,090
A unified resistance of the vikings was
losing ground and mailshake nail would

336
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:19,680
ultimately be unsuccessful and his efforts
and he would die of seemingly natural

337
00:20:19,681 --> 00:20:24,681
causes in age 62 with Ireland divided
between various Viking and Irish kingdoms

338
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:29,730
and his kingdom becoming divided amongst
successors as these kingdoms would now

339
00:20:29,731 --> 00:20:34,560
not only interact but form
alliances against each other
in certain circumstances

340
00:20:34,890 --> 00:20:39,540
with their position now secured many
high Burno vikings would now focus on the

341
00:20:39,541 --> 00:20:43,760
much wealthier opportunities of the
Anglo Saxon Kingdoms and eight seventies

342
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:44,221
however,

343
00:20:44,221 --> 00:20:49,221
sources indicate that both Olaf and
Emr died while campaigning and Britain

344
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:54,100
leading to a less vigorous of Viking
presence in Ireland and nine oh two as a

345
00:20:54,101 --> 00:20:54,881
result of this,

346
00:20:54,881 --> 00:20:59,350
a group of Irish under male Finna Mick
Flanagan and Kerbal McMurray mcmurrin

347
00:20:59,470 --> 00:21:01,060
routed the vikings from Dublin,

348
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:04,150
essentially ending the
first viking age in Ireland.

349
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:07,150
This victory was a short
lived as the vikings.

350
00:21:07,151 --> 00:21:11,800
We returned in nine 14 reclaiming Dublin
and expanding in other parts of the

351
00:21:11,801 --> 00:21:13,660
island.
Despite they return,

352
00:21:13,810 --> 00:21:16,630
they would not make much effort
to control Ireland again,

353
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:19,270
still focusing on England and as a result,

354
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:22,180
their power began fading
in the early 10th century.

355
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:26,860
The Viking invasion started coming to
an end around the year nine 50 and this

356
00:21:26,861 --> 00:21:30,430
date is often considered to be the
end of the Viking age in Ireland,

357
00:21:30,730 --> 00:21:33,850
though not at all the end of
the north presence in Ireland,

358
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:38,500
the Norse still in Ireland, especially
the north scales as we shall see,

359
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:43,390
remained active and retained their rule
primarily in the south and east as they

360
00:21:43,391 --> 00:21:46,090
had been militarily
unsuccessful in the north.

361
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:50,890
I'll be it more as kings of nations than
heads of raiding parties. Nevertheless,

362
00:21:50,950 --> 00:21:55,300
this would be the beginning of a slow
process with a viking stove to assimilate

363
00:21:55,301 --> 00:22:00,301
into Irish custom speak Irish follow
Irish religion and live like Irishman

364
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:03,460
around this time across
the Irish Sea in England,

365
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:08,290
the many Anglo Saxon Kingdoms
were beginning to unite
under west six becoming a

366
00:22:08,291 --> 00:22:10,000
more modern kingdom of England.

367
00:22:10,210 --> 00:22:13,120
Similar changes were happening
elsewhere in Europe as well,

368
00:22:13,450 --> 00:22:17,950
and a movement to consolidate power
under a single ruler in Ireland was

369
00:22:17,951 --> 00:22:18,730
inevitable.

370
00:22:18,730 --> 00:22:23,050
Such a movement would come from the ruler
of a less powerful kingdom of monster

371
00:22:23,170 --> 00:22:25,570
by a man named Brian [inaudible].

372
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:30,750
Brian was a son of the king of doll cosh
kinetic Maclaurin when his father died

373
00:22:30,971 --> 00:22:34,180
in nine 51 rural pastor,
Brian's older brother,

374
00:22:34,330 --> 00:22:38,350
Megaman Megaman set about trying
to become the king of all monster,

375
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:41,920
capturing a rock of Cashel,
the historic capital of the region.

376
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:47,000
This naturally invited conflict with his
Irish and Norse neighbors and in nine

377
00:22:47,050 --> 00:22:50,110
76 he was murdered during the negotiation,

378
00:22:50,111 --> 00:22:53,050
which was claimed be peaceful
by his rival male mood.

379
00:22:53,470 --> 00:22:58,450
Brian inherited the throne and set about
trying to continue his brother's work.

380
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:01,480
Brian is described as a born warrior.

381
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:05,530
He had learned a considerable
amount about not only Irish warfare,

382
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:08,140
but also viking warfare.
As a result,

383
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:11,020
you place an emphasis
on naval superiority.

384
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:15,040
He would go to war with male mood and the
Viking came them of limerick defeating

385
00:23:15,041 --> 00:23:19,480
them both and extending his authority
across monster. He would kill mail mood,

386
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:20,500
but interestingly,

387
00:23:20,530 --> 00:23:24,850
his son Keon would be spared and
throughout Brian's life remained an ally.

388
00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:27,640
But north of Limerick is
well wealthy and powerful.

389
00:23:27,670 --> 00:23:31,360
We're allowed to live peacefully so
long as they remained loyal to Brian.

390
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:36,310
Brian then turned his ambitions
outside monster into neighboring areas,

391
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:38,620
specifically lends to Arconic and mead.

392
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:43,240
This would draw him into conflict with
mailshake nail king of mead who claim to

393
00:23:43,241 --> 00:23:47,000
be the high king of Ireland.
The conflict would be long and bloody,

394
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:48,590
but by nine any six,

395
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:52,850
Brian controlled Lenstar and was proving
themselves to be militarily superior.

396
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:56,960
This essentially forced a peace
negotiation with Brian Lang,

397
00:23:56,961 --> 00:23:58,970
claim of the south and check nail.

398
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:03,740
The north though piece externally had
been secured momentarily stability was

399
00:24:03,741 --> 00:24:05,330
threatened on the inside as well.

400
00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:08,270
Not all the kings of Ireland
were content to recognize.

401
00:24:08,271 --> 00:24:12,950
Brian is hiking and rebellion in lunch
through occurred not long after this,

402
00:24:13,010 --> 00:24:18,010
aided by the high burden north of Dublin
in a war ending in the year nine 99 at

403
00:24:18,141 --> 00:24:22,610
the battle of Glen Mama, Brian defeated
both armies encaptured Dublin as well,

404
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:24,230
the wealthy center of the island.

405
00:24:24,650 --> 00:24:29,540
Now Brian was ready to break the piece
he had made with CIC nail and he invaded

406
00:24:29,541 --> 00:24:34,460
mead defeating the Kingdom and 10 oh two
now the only region which Brian had the

407
00:24:34,461 --> 00:24:39,170
gain was Ulster in the northeast almost
there would not be quite so easily

408
00:24:39,171 --> 00:24:42,080
obtained and the first
Brian's armies were defeated.

409
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:46,520
Much of his advanced us was left to
cooperation with the Catholic church,

410
00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:48,320
which was an elite in Ireland.

411
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:52,520
Notably by recognizing their authority
and bribing them with a church on his

412
00:24:52,521 --> 00:24:53,060
side,

413
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:57,140
Brian would begin seeing more success
in obtaining all star in the year 10 oh

414
00:24:57,141 --> 00:25:02,141
eight by 10 11 Brian had defeated
the canal Connell of Western holster.

415
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:07,360
He was now truly high king of Ireland or
as a church called him and Perah tour.

416
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:11,630
[inaudible] meaning emperor
of the Scots or as you recall,

417
00:25:11,690 --> 00:25:13,340
emperor of the gales.

418
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:18,400
It is also around this time that he
also received his surname Baru or an old

419
00:25:18,411 --> 00:25:22,940
Irish bar rumor. This is related to
the modern Irish word bow, meaning cow.

420
00:25:22,970 --> 00:25:27,890
He was Brian of the cattle tributes in a
society where cattle were the symbol of

421
00:25:27,891 --> 00:25:29,840
wealth.
This was a great title.

422
00:25:30,350 --> 00:25:34,250
Brian and the church were now seemingly
began to realize their vision,

423
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:37,670
a United Ireland under
the authority of one king,

424
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,740
yet there was still work to be done.

425
00:25:39,830 --> 00:25:44,000
It would be more correct view Brian
not as the king of a single kingdom,

426
00:25:44,030 --> 00:25:48,830
but the king on top of other kings which
ruled their own kingdoms. Furthermore,

427
00:25:48,890 --> 00:25:53,890
while the Norris Gail Kingdoms like
Dublin limerick also recognize Brian as

428
00:25:54,111 --> 00:25:54,944
their high king,

429
00:25:55,070 --> 00:25:59,870
they were much more removed from Irish
society and still functioned to a strong

430
00:25:59,871 --> 00:26:02,570
degree independently under their own law.

431
00:26:02,930 --> 00:26:07,930
How Far Brian could have gone as high
king of all Ireland remains uncertain as

432
00:26:08,031 --> 00:26:10,220
not long after he accomplish this,

433
00:26:10,430 --> 00:26:15,290
it began to break apart discontented
kings in Lenstar and Ulster rose up in

434
00:26:15,291 --> 00:26:19,940
rebellion and 10 12 and attacked mead
and later north scales specifically

435
00:26:19,941 --> 00:26:24,290
Dubliners would join in on the rebellion,
which will be led by mail morta.

436
00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:29,570
To make matters worse as fighting
intensified mailshake nail kink of mead

437
00:26:29,630 --> 00:26:30,650
betrayed Brian,

438
00:26:31,430 --> 00:26:36,430
the two sides would meet at the battle
of [inaudible] April 23rd 10 14 the

439
00:26:37,131 --> 00:26:39,890
battle ended with a mix of results.

440
00:26:40,310 --> 00:26:44,850
The Irish under Brian had won the
battle thus curtailing the power,

441
00:26:44,910 --> 00:26:47,250
the high burden nor
significantly in event,

442
00:26:47,251 --> 00:26:51,900
which is often regarded as a true and of
the cog had Godell regardless. However,

443
00:26:51,990 --> 00:26:56,340
Brian was actually killed in this battle.
It's not exactly known how,

444
00:26:56,610 --> 00:27:01,440
but legend states that he was decapitated
by a rogue viking named [inaudible]

445
00:27:01,770 --> 00:27:05,970
who cut through Irish lions and found
Brian in his tent than age there. Ron,

446
00:27:05,971 --> 00:27:07,770
probably 70 in prayer,

447
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:13,040
hopes of a United Ireland died for a
time with Brian Baru as contenders all

448
00:27:13,171 --> 00:27:17,100
began struggling from the throne.
Brian's the sentence, however,

449
00:27:17,130 --> 00:27:18,840
which continued to rule Munster.

450
00:27:19,050 --> 00:27:24,050
This family is known as the O'brien's
and name which like the nail who became

451
00:27:24,241 --> 00:27:27,390
their own Neal's would persist
throughout Irish history.

452
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:30,600
Through the modern day and
even into the 24th century,

453
00:27:30,630 --> 00:27:35,280
Brian's family and Munster made efforts
to reclaim the title of hiking and his

454
00:27:35,281 --> 00:27:38,130
son Duncan McBrian would claim the title,

455
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:42,480
though it was not widely recognized and
he was one of many who would be known as

456
00:27:42,481 --> 00:27:46,080
a [inaudible] and Kfar Saba
hiking with opposition.

457
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:50,100
While they may considerable
gains and had notable successes,

458
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:52,740
they would be ultimately unsuccessful,

459
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:55,890
especially as soon as the
sentence turn on each other.

460
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:58,170
When Mira talk was Brian Brews,

461
00:27:58,171 --> 00:28:03,171
grandson gave up his position as king
power shifted from Munster to conduct and

462
00:28:03,811 --> 00:28:05,040
the O'connor family,

463
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:09,960
specifically Thurlow O'connor Turla set
about trying to win the true title of

464
00:28:09,961 --> 00:28:14,730
High King, but had we control over much
of Ireland and never controlled Olster,

465
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:17,670
his son,
Rory O'connor would succeed him,

466
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:22,290
but he would face a United invasion
from lenstoler under Dermot McMorrow and

467
00:28:22,291 --> 00:28:26,940
Olster under Maria Talk Mclaughlin. As a
result, your light himself with Tiernan,

468
00:28:26,941 --> 00:28:31,560
Eroica, Britney, and war ensued
O'Connor and or work. We're victorious.

469
00:28:31,561 --> 00:28:36,561
And an 1166 O'connor was crowned high
king and Dublin O'connor ruled as a true

470
00:28:38,071 --> 00:28:41,670
high king with the political and
religious figures of our lend,

471
00:28:41,671 --> 00:28:45,720
all recognizing his authority,
Dermot Mcmurray Lenstar, however,

472
00:28:45,750 --> 00:28:49,920
had escaped and fled eastward with no
intention of letting this be final.

473
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:57,510
Dermot fled to England and then to France.
In search of Henry,

474
00:28:57,511 --> 00:29:02,070
the second grandson and William the
conqueror, the king of the Norman Empire,

475
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:05,130
and subsequently King of England,
the Normans,

476
00:29:05,190 --> 00:29:07,860
descendants of a mix of vikings in French.

477
00:29:07,890 --> 00:29:10,800
We're one of the strongest
military forces in Europe,

478
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:13,200
unable to beat O'Connor on his own.

479
00:29:13,230 --> 00:29:17,340
He realized foreign aid would be the
key to retaking is thrown in Leicester.

480
00:29:17,670 --> 00:29:22,570
As a result of this, Dermot is often
regarded by the Irish as one of the worst,

481
00:29:22,590 --> 00:29:27,570
a long line of Irishman who betray their
country for the favors of foreigners,

482
00:29:27,630 --> 00:29:30,030
namely the English.
For now,

483
00:29:30,031 --> 00:29:34,410
Dermot was inviting a neighbor into his
own nation with whom on Bono's to him.

484
00:29:34,411 --> 00:29:38,310
Of course, the Irish would quarrel
for nearly a thousand years.

485
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:40,620
Dermot met with Henry the second,

486
00:29:40,650 --> 00:29:44,710
and Henry agreed to support Dermot
and exchange for his loyalty.

487
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:47,500
Henry would not join Durant personally,

488
00:29:47,590 --> 00:29:51,610
but granted him the right recruit
English soldiers and mercenaries for his

489
00:29:51,611 --> 00:29:55,510
conquest. Dermot found a number
of powerful Norman allies,

490
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:58,510
including Robert Fitts,
Steven Marise, Fitzgerald,

491
00:29:58,690 --> 00:30:03,470
and Richard Fitz Gilbert known as land
as we shot arc for Richard Strongbow.

492
00:30:03,670 --> 00:30:08,560
Dermot offered Strongbow a very
enticing deal in exchange for his help.

493
00:30:08,770 --> 00:30:13,390
He would allow him to marry his daughter
Eva and would name him his successor as

494
00:30:13,391 --> 00:30:14,290
king of Lenster,

495
00:30:14,291 --> 00:30:19,291
effectively transferring rural of an
Irish came them over to a Norman loyal to

496
00:30:19,481 --> 00:30:23,410
another king. There was also money to
be made and land to grab in Ireland,

497
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:27,700
which Strongbow and his allies figured
would enhance their power and prestige.

498
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:32,950
Dermot did not introduce the concept of
invading Arlinda Henry the second Henry

499
00:30:32,951 --> 00:30:36,880
had actually been considering it for
some time and even received support from

500
00:30:36,881 --> 00:30:40,630
the church as Pope Adrian,
the fourth and Alexander the third.

501
00:30:40,660 --> 00:30:45,130
We're concerned about the independent
nature of the Irish church. However,

502
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:49,030
he did provide Henry with an
opportunity that he couldn't refuse.

503
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:53,620
Dermot and Strongbow assembled an army
of Norman's Saxons and Welshman and the

504
00:30:53,621 --> 00:30:58,621
Tact Wexford and 1169 those strong boasts
stayed behind for the time Dermot them

505
00:30:59,141 --> 00:31:00,970
again pushing further into Ireland,

506
00:31:00,971 --> 00:31:04,570
but was eventually met by O'connor
who began to feeding his forces.

507
00:31:04,690 --> 00:31:09,690
The two sides met at ferns
for negotiations which were
mediated by the church.

508
00:31:09,850 --> 00:31:13,870
It was agreed that Dermot could once
again become king of Lens there as long as

509
00:31:13,871 --> 00:31:18,310
he continued to recognize warrior
O'connor as high king later and private.

510
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:22,450
They are said to have agreed to stop
bringing foreigners into Irish fights,

511
00:31:22,810 --> 00:31:27,810
but it was too late for that strong
arrived and 1170 and took Dublin,

512
00:31:27,970 --> 00:31:32,170
began to feeding O'Connor as winter
set in and the two armies seized.

513
00:31:32,210 --> 00:31:37,210
Royal Connor began fearing
that he wouldn't be able
to best Strongbow in May of

514
00:31:37,241 --> 00:31:41,320
1171 matters complicated.
Further, when Dermot died,

515
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:45,850
Dermot McMorrow had essentially died
before he could enjoy the rule of lunch or

516
00:31:45,851 --> 00:31:49,870
for which and the eyes of his countryman.
He's sold Arland soul.

517
00:31:49,930 --> 00:31:52,870
Though historically speaking,
with or without Dermot,

518
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:55,810
the Normans probably would've
come to Ireland anyway.

519
00:31:55,960 --> 00:32:00,010
Dermot son tried to claim the throne
of Lens through an accordance with the

520
00:32:00,011 --> 00:32:00,821
Breton laws,

521
00:32:00,821 --> 00:32:04,480
but Strongbow who had married Dermot's
daughter by this point had been

522
00:32:04,481 --> 00:32:08,680
guaranteed a throne and was militarily
more powerful, succeeded him.

523
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:12,280
This concerned not only the Irish,
but King Henry as well.

524
00:32:12,490 --> 00:32:15,380
Henry was suspicious of strong motives,

525
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:19,870
especially given the strong most father
was an opponent who had opposed his

526
00:32:19,871 --> 00:32:24,160
succession during a civil war known
as the anarchy in England. Now,

527
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:28,740
Strongbow had married into the Irish
nobility and ruled as king of Lens.

528
00:32:28,741 --> 00:32:33,610
They're unsure of his loyalties.
Henry felt he had to invade Ireland.

529
00:32:34,210 --> 00:32:36,400
Though at first Strongbow ignored him.

530
00:32:36,401 --> 00:32:40,070
Henry was able to secure as loyalties
with only the threat of invasion.

531
00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:43,820
Nevertheless,
power in Ireland still remained unsteady.

532
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:48,230
Strongbows governance was disliked by
the North Scales and the Irish kings and

533
00:32:48,231 --> 00:32:50,540
the Irish church. We're
not very happy with, uh,

534
00:32:50,541 --> 00:32:53,990
Norman arrival either and would
likely oppose it again violently.

535
00:32:54,020 --> 00:32:56,510
So Henry decided to invade that year.

536
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:59,780
Henry invade with a
forest of around 5,000.

537
00:32:59,930 --> 00:33:03,260
These soldiers were highly trained
and well armed and armored.

538
00:33:03,290 --> 00:33:06,490
Many Irish King's felt
that resistance was futile,

539
00:33:06,830 --> 00:33:09,680
especially as they weren't
only dealing with the English,

540
00:33:09,710 --> 00:33:12,320
but a forest which had the
backing of the Vatican.

541
00:33:12,470 --> 00:33:16,400
The thus began submitting to Henry
the first being Donald McCarthy,

542
00:33:16,550 --> 00:33:17,570
the king of Desmond.

543
00:33:17,990 --> 00:33:22,220
Gradually much of Ireland fell to
English rule with mostly on the north.

544
00:33:22,221 --> 00:33:22,940
Holding out.

545
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:27,940
In 1172 Henry began encouraging English
colonization of Ireland and allowed hue

546
00:33:28,281 --> 00:33:32,990
to Lacie to push in the mead. Ireland
was now a nation of four languages,

547
00:33:33,140 --> 00:33:36,950
Irish Anglo, Norman, French,
Latin, and old English,

548
00:33:37,010 --> 00:33:40,670
which would have a lasting effect
on the linguistics of Ireland.

549
00:33:41,030 --> 00:33:41,811
The norm is began,

550
00:33:41,811 --> 00:33:45,140
solidified their position in Ireland
as they had done in other regions,

551
00:33:45,141 --> 00:33:47,030
including England,
a century earlier.

552
00:33:47,180 --> 00:33:51,020
This along with the Catholic church
moving into Ireland and pressing forms,

553
00:33:51,050 --> 00:33:55,070
intermarriage and attempts to reorganize
the country territorially and legally

554
00:33:55,130 --> 00:33:59,180
by introducing feudalism and replacing
Brett and law with English law would have

555
00:33:59,181 --> 00:34:01,280
a permanent effect on Ireland as well.

556
00:34:02,270 --> 00:34:06,050
The English felt that they were
civilizing Ireland, much like the Romans.

557
00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:11,240
The Irish weren't content with this and
though facing a stronger occupying force

558
00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:16,220
would begin resistance in wars marking
the beginning of Anglo Irish conflict,

559
00:34:16,310 --> 00:34:19,010
which would last for centuries.
Vo,

560
00:34:19,011 --> 00:34:24,011
Rory O'connor and Henry agreed to terms
with the tree of Windsor O'connor fail

561
00:34:24,111 --> 00:34:28,610
to control the other Irish kings and
Henry a times fail to control his own

562
00:34:28,611 --> 00:34:29,840
Norman subjects as well.

563
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:35,020
Many were busy carving out kingdoms
and territories for themselves and 1177

564
00:34:35,810 --> 00:34:38,210
Henry made his son John Dominus,

565
00:34:38,270 --> 00:34:42,020
he Barney I Lord of Ireland
when he was only 10 years old.

566
00:34:42,260 --> 00:34:45,980
He would of course not assumed command
of his position until he was matured and

567
00:34:45,981 --> 00:34:46,730
trained,

568
00:34:46,730 --> 00:34:51,730
but in 1185 at the age of 18 you left
England for Dublin much to his father's

569
00:34:52,731 --> 00:34:55,730
disappointment and the
resentment of the Irish kings.

570
00:34:55,731 --> 00:34:58,970
He was expected to rule
John acted like a clown.

571
00:34:59,210 --> 00:35:02,420
An example of this is that
when he first encountered them,

572
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:07,370
he mocked the beer is of the Irish kings
and pulled on them when he got to work.

573
00:35:07,460 --> 00:35:11,240
Ultimately he failed and the conflicts
against the Irish wouldn't pay his

574
00:35:11,241 --> 00:35:15,740
soldiers and failed secure royal
authority over the English settlers there.

575
00:35:15,860 --> 00:35:20,860
He left that December returning back to
England in 1199 King John unexpectedly

576
00:35:21,471 --> 00:35:25,820
came to the throne. Ireland remained
divided between English and Irish rule.

577
00:35:26,150 --> 00:35:28,100
Some Lens.
We're steadily English,

578
00:35:28,130 --> 00:35:32,450
but others much less so and many areas
of the country still defiantly under

579
00:35:32,451 --> 00:35:33,284
Irish rule,

580
00:35:33,620 --> 00:35:38,220
though remembered as an insane and an
effective ruler and English history.

581
00:35:38,490 --> 00:35:43,490
John did work on capitulating Ireland
considerably by reorganizing the system of

582
00:35:43,981 --> 00:35:48,090
governance on the island and showing
loyalty to him. Nevertheless,

583
00:35:48,150 --> 00:35:53,150
rebellion even among John's own subjects
would sprout up and it is at this time

584
00:35:53,191 --> 00:35:56,520
that we see another feature of
the Anglo Irish conflict emerge.

585
00:35:56,670 --> 00:36:00,420
The Irish turn to the enemy of
their enemy France. For support,

586
00:36:01,170 --> 00:36:05,520
though these rebellions were unsuccessful
for as long as England would control

587
00:36:05,521 --> 00:36:07,170
Ireland,
England's enemies,

588
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:11,640
specifically France and Spain would take
an interest in encouraging trouble in

589
00:36:11,641 --> 00:36:15,930
Ireland. The aangeland Norman's would
continue attempting to expand into Ireland

590
00:36:15,931 --> 00:36:19,980
throughout the reign of Henry the third
John's successor specifically into

591
00:36:19,981 --> 00:36:24,060
regions such as conduct where high
king O'Connor had originally hailed.

592
00:36:24,690 --> 00:36:28,590
This became more and more difficult
as some Anglo Norman's in Ireland were

593
00:36:28,591 --> 00:36:33,060
ruling more and more independently
and others had lost interest in Arland

594
00:36:33,061 --> 00:36:34,860
altogether.
Furthermore,

595
00:36:35,190 --> 00:36:39,270
the Irish were adopting the technology
and tactics of the rest of Europe and

596
00:36:39,271 --> 00:36:42,330
working with Scottish
mercenaries against English rule,

597
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:46,620
allowing them to refuse to pay
tribute and to raid the English Lens,

598
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:51,510
which was contributing to
a weakening Norman presence
on the island. Importantly,

599
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:55,230
and the 13th century,
the ideals of the English nobility,

600
00:36:55,260 --> 00:36:59,580
which had been emphasize in reaction
to King John's tyrannical rule that

601
00:36:59,581 --> 00:37:03,720
eventually led to the magna Carta
spread into Ireland as well.

602
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:09,020
This became much more evident in the
reign of Edward the first when in 1297 the

603
00:37:09,391 --> 00:37:10,660
Irish parliament form.

604
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:14,940
This was not necessarily a move to
grant the English in Ireland more

605
00:37:14,941 --> 00:37:15,720
independence,

606
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:20,220
but rather it wasn't attempt to ensure
English law was upheld in Ireland as well

607
00:37:20,221 --> 00:37:21,180
as English culture.

608
00:37:21,181 --> 00:37:24,570
In a time when the English there
were becoming worryingly Irish,

609
00:37:24,630 --> 00:37:27,180
a trend which would
continue for centuries.

610
00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:31,980
It was also though a move to led the
Anglo Irish deal with their own problems

611
00:37:31,981 --> 00:37:36,240
because Edward had enough of his own,
namely in France and Scotland,

612
00:37:36,450 --> 00:37:40,500
resistance under the leadership of
a nobleman named William Wallace was

613
00:37:40,501 --> 00:37:41,580
beginning and Scotland.

614
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:45,750
Tensions between England and Scotland
were heating up and Arland would feel the

615
00:37:45,751 --> 00:37:48,450
effects of this and see
opportunity within it.

616
00:37:48,630 --> 00:37:53,010
Independent Ireland and Scotland were
at this time, culturally, historically,

617
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:57,570
linguistically, ethnically, etc.
Similar and with a mutual enemy,

618
00:37:57,600 --> 00:38:02,600
a cooperative effort was likely to form
that we're the first died in 1307 and

619
00:38:02,761 --> 00:38:06,990
was succeeded by his son Edward,
the second in Scotland a year earlier,

620
00:38:07,290 --> 00:38:08,970
Robert the Bruce had become king.

621
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:13,440
The lords of Arlene's saw a potential
ally and Robert the Bruce and Bruce felt

622
00:38:13,441 --> 00:38:17,790
likewise knowing that an independent
Ireland could be crucial in the feeding

623
00:38:17,791 --> 00:38:22,791
England in 1315 Robert the Bruce
along with his younger brother Edward,

624
00:38:22,830 --> 00:38:25,560
devise the plan and their
efforts to defeat England.

625
00:38:25,770 --> 00:38:30,770
Edward would take a force of around 6,000
soldiers to help liberate Ireland and

626
00:38:31,021 --> 00:38:34,740
an exchange. The Irish kings would
recognize Edward as high king.

627
00:38:35,050 --> 00:38:36,140
This would open up,

628
00:38:36,141 --> 00:38:40,360
but as tracking second front in the
Anglo Scottish wars and create what they

629
00:38:40,361 --> 00:38:45,361
called a grand Gaelic alliance with
Robert as king of Scotland and Edward as

630
00:38:45,731 --> 00:38:47,380
king of Ireland.
From there,

631
00:38:47,410 --> 00:38:52,390
they could move into the aisle of men
and secure a similar arrangement in Wales

632
00:38:52,420 --> 00:38:57,420
and invade their Edward landed with his
army and may of 1315 and eastern Ulster.

633
00:38:58,510 --> 00:39:03,220
He was joined by Irish soldiers and began
his campaign seeing a great amount of

634
00:39:03,221 --> 00:39:07,000
success against the English there and
kept pushing into English territory.

635
00:39:07,060 --> 00:39:10,900
Within a year, Edward was
crowned King of Ireland. However,

636
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:13,810
it was very premature.
Unfortunately,

637
00:39:13,990 --> 00:39:17,860
this war in a second front
had begun during a harsh time,

638
00:39:18,070 --> 00:39:23,070
a period of fem and which lasted until
1317 affecting all of Europe with no

639
00:39:23,441 --> 00:39:24,670
exception in Ireland,

640
00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:28,540
where perhaps up to a quarter of the
population to come to the feminine.

641
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:32,050
Feeding the troops was a major
burden and though Robert the Bruce,

642
00:39:32,051 --> 00:39:35,260
his arrival in the winter
of 1316 was encouraging.

643
00:39:35,290 --> 00:39:40,290
It only increased a number of mouths to
feed and by 1317 fighting between the

644
00:39:40,421 --> 00:39:44,950
two sides was slowing down as both sides
lack the ability to continue to fight.

645
00:39:45,250 --> 00:39:46,030
That year,

646
00:39:46,030 --> 00:39:49,120
the Irish began splitting off from
the main Scottish army into their own

647
00:39:49,121 --> 00:39:53,560
movements and when Edward failed to
capture Dublin and limerick cities which

648
00:39:53,561 --> 00:39:57,400
were considerably loyal to England,
the movement began to fall apart.

649
00:39:57,460 --> 00:40:02,170
And later in October of 1318 Edward,
the Bruce died in battle.

650
00:40:02,260 --> 00:40:04,870
Despite a technical English victory,

651
00:40:05,050 --> 00:40:07,810
Ireland was becoming too
difficult to control.

652
00:40:08,050 --> 00:40:12,670
This war had torn apart English authority
on the island and English power began

653
00:40:12,671 --> 00:40:17,440
waning and the area over the course of
the 14th century though controlling many

654
00:40:17,441 --> 00:40:18,640
parts of the island,

655
00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:23,020
the English monarchy only truly held
power in the areas around Dublin.

656
00:40:23,310 --> 00:40:26,410
In 1327 Edward the third
came to the throne.

657
00:40:26,530 --> 00:40:30,670
He began attempting to bring order to
Ireland once again by various means,

658
00:40:30,671 --> 00:40:33,610
including increasing and
administrative presence,

659
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:38,440
backed by a military presence
and executing political
rivals in Ireland while

660
00:40:38,441 --> 00:40:43,150
viewing the Anglo Irish with contempt
and barring them from public offices.

661
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:48,040
The Anglo Irish protested claiming these
new reforms would bring instability to

662
00:40:48,041 --> 00:40:50,080
the island,
yet the policies held,

663
00:40:50,110 --> 00:40:54,910
but all the while the Irish
were constantly causing
havoc on the borders with

664
00:40:54,911 --> 00:40:57,340
instability and war constant in Ireland.

665
00:40:57,400 --> 00:41:02,380
The black death reached the island and
1348 exacerbating everything and killing

666
00:41:02,381 --> 00:41:06,310
likely over half the population of
Ireland. The plague was most intense,

667
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:10,720
the towns and cities where English power
was concentrated and thus the native

668
00:41:10,721 --> 00:41:12,880
Irish gained more power and authority.

669
00:41:13,270 --> 00:41:18,250
By 1360 the situation was so desperate
that the Anglo Irish wrote to the king

670
00:41:18,260 --> 00:41:22,420
informing him that if nothing was done,
Ireland will be lost.

671
00:41:22,630 --> 00:41:23,530
In response,

672
00:41:23,590 --> 00:41:27,610
Edwards sent his son Lionel to Ireland
with an army to restore authority

673
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:32,260
primarily to ensure Ireland's loyalty and
economic profitability during war with

674
00:41:32,261 --> 00:41:33,094
France.

675
00:41:33,170 --> 00:41:37,820
Lionel was not greatly successful and
many in England complained that the

676
00:41:37,821 --> 00:41:42,821
resources required to hold on to Ireland
far outweighed its economic worth and

677
00:41:43,311 --> 00:41:44,630
even if it were worth it,

678
00:41:44,810 --> 00:41:49,810
England had more significant problems
like France and Scotland as well as these

679
00:41:50,061 --> 00:41:54,620
sicknesses and feminines which cause
havoc on the nation. By this point,

680
00:41:54,710 --> 00:41:59,510
the Anglo Irish becoming
now truly worryingly Irish
as they were speaking Irish

681
00:41:59,570 --> 00:42:04,070
dressing like the Irish intermarrying
with them starting to fall a brand and law

682
00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:06,980
and altogether living like the Irish.
As a result,

683
00:42:07,310 --> 00:42:12,080
Lionel called together
the Irish parliament attic
Kilkenny and created a new set

684
00:42:12,081 --> 00:42:17,081
of laws known as the statutes of cocaine
concerning the lives of the Anglo

685
00:42:17,630 --> 00:42:17,810
Irish.

686
00:42:17,810 --> 00:42:22,810
The intention of these laws was to bring
the Anglo Irish back to their English

687
00:42:23,001 --> 00:42:26,900
roots by Bending Englishman from
speaking Irish, dressing like them,

688
00:42:26,901 --> 00:42:30,050
interacting with them in various ways
such as marriage and certain kinds of

689
00:42:30,051 --> 00:42:34,400
business and even bending their Irish
names, forcing them to anglicize them.

690
00:42:34,730 --> 00:42:38,780
This sounds like an effective means of
bringing the island back under English

691
00:42:38,781 --> 00:42:41,330
control,
but unfortunately for the English,

692
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:45,350
they retained little power over the Anglo
Irish at this point and the statutes

693
00:42:45,351 --> 00:42:49,880
didn't change much outside of the Pale
and in fact it worse intentions with the

694
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:53,120
hours and selves who are now
viewed as second class citizens.

695
00:42:53,870 --> 00:42:58,640
Edward died in 1377 with a situation
in Ireland worsening his 10 year old

696
00:42:58,641 --> 00:43:03,290
grandson, Richard's second succeed at
him. When Richard the second came of age,

697
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:06,230
the Irish parliament again
called on the king for help,

698
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:09,500
fear and the loss of the entire island.
At first,

699
00:43:09,530 --> 00:43:13,040
Richard's focus wasn't France
fighting the hundred years war,

700
00:43:13,070 --> 00:43:17,300
but later in his reign he sought piece
with the French. As for Ireland, however,

701
00:43:17,330 --> 00:43:21,020
he prepared an invasion to
subdue the island by force.

702
00:43:21,590 --> 00:43:25,490
Ireland had become somewhat of
an embarrassment to the English.

703
00:43:25,910 --> 00:43:29,960
It said that when Richard was suggested
as an heir to the throne of the holy

704
00:43:29,961 --> 00:43:30,770
Roman Empire,

705
00:43:30,770 --> 00:43:35,770
they basically Martha concept of him
being the savior of Europe from the Muslim

706
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:39,950
Turks that the German's needed when he
couldn't in their eyes even maintain rule

707
00:43:39,951 --> 00:43:41,810
of a primitive inferior nation.

708
00:43:42,260 --> 00:43:47,260
In 1394 Richard landed in Waterford
bringing with them around 8,000 soldiers.

709
00:43:47,780 --> 00:43:51,530
He was the first English king to visit
Ireland and almost two centuries.

710
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:55,850
He had a great deal of success and
reinstating rural authority and try to

711
00:43:55,851 --> 00:43:59,600
reorganize administration of the
island. Again, Richard success,

712
00:43:59,601 --> 00:44:01,550
your wasn't gained through many battles,

713
00:44:01,580 --> 00:44:05,600
but more through show of force and
diplomacy. It seems to have worked,

714
00:44:05,660 --> 00:44:10,490
but when he left in 1395 orders started
to unravel again and the country turned

715
00:44:10,491 --> 00:44:12,410
back to division and warfare.

716
00:44:12,470 --> 00:44:17,210
When he returned and 1399 things
did not go as smoothly. In fact,

717
00:44:17,211 --> 00:44:19,220
it was a completely different outcome.

718
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:23,510
This was a time when the throne of
England became much more unstable and

719
00:44:23,511 --> 00:44:27,380
Richard's claim to it wasn't certain
leading to a late response to what was

720
00:44:27,381 --> 00:44:31,500
going on in Ireland and poor
coordination of his campaign. The Irish,

721
00:44:31,501 --> 00:44:35,280
along with some Anglo Irish,
fought back against Richard this time,

722
00:44:35,310 --> 00:44:39,360
mostly through guerrilla warfare.
During this unsuccessful campaign,

723
00:44:39,390 --> 00:44:40,890
Richard's rivals to the throne.

724
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:43,950
Henry Bolingbroke took control
of the throne from him,

725
00:44:44,010 --> 00:44:47,100
deposing him rather easily as
he had become an unpopular king.

726
00:44:47,340 --> 00:44:52,200
Bolingbroke became Henry the fourth Henry
who had kicked Richard off throne was

727
00:44:52,201 --> 00:44:55,170
now not keen on leaving it
for adventures in Ireland,

728
00:44:55,230 --> 00:44:57,810
nor did England really
have the funds to do so.

729
00:44:57,930 --> 00:45:02,370
Leading to a continuation of the slow
loss of English power in Ireland over the

730
00:45:02,371 --> 00:45:06,840
course of the 15th century as femme and
caused by poor weather and plague hit.

731
00:45:06,841 --> 00:45:10,410
Yet again, English power in
Ireland retracted to the Pale.

732
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:13,770
The area around Dublin,
which was firmly loyal to England.

733
00:45:13,860 --> 00:45:17,340
Anyone living beyond the Pale
was considered a foreigner,

734
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:22,200
including the Anglo Irish settlers
and in the eyes of the English savage

735
00:45:22,201 --> 00:45:27,201
barbarians and the eyes of the Anglo
Irish English power was collapsing and

736
00:45:27,211 --> 00:45:32,130
there's slow integration into
Irish society now hastened
as they had to fend for

737
00:45:32,131 --> 00:45:36,120
themselves and the eyes of the Irish.
The foreign oppressor was retreating.

738
00:45:36,180 --> 00:45:37,890
Many returned back to England.

739
00:45:37,950 --> 00:45:42,690
The statutes of Kilkenny were irrelevant
and Gaelic rule was beginning to thrive

740
00:45:42,691 --> 00:45:43,110
again.

741
00:45:43,110 --> 00:45:48,110
As Irish king's began to rise to power
as they had in the olden days still.

742
00:45:48,151 --> 00:45:51,720
However, there was no Irish
unity to expedite this process.

743
00:45:51,810 --> 00:45:53,670
The Irish remained divided.

744
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:58,880
In 1413 Henry was succeeded by Henry
becoming Henry the fifth who would do

745
00:45:59,131 --> 00:46:03,750
little in Ireland focusing instead on
France. When Henry died from dysentery,

746
00:46:03,810 --> 00:46:06,000
his infant son Henry was succeed.

747
00:46:06,001 --> 00:46:10,800
Him Becoming Henry the sixth Henry the
sixth was a weak king who was viewed as

748
00:46:10,801 --> 00:46:15,540
incompetent and likely suffered from
a strong degree of mental illness.

749
00:46:15,660 --> 00:46:18,780
He would lose the war in France,
and more importantly,

750
00:46:18,810 --> 00:46:23,340
with loses thrown in a conflict that would
make Ireland important to the English.

751
00:46:23,341 --> 00:46:25,170
Again,
the war of the roses,

752
00:46:25,230 --> 00:46:28,500
which divided not only
England but Arland as well.

753
00:46:28,710 --> 00:46:33,710
In 1449 Henry and his wife decided to
position Richard of York a potential

754
00:46:33,991 --> 00:46:35,910
threat to thrown in Ireland.

755
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:40,770
This wasn't merely a banishment as
Richard was Earl of Ulster and had an

756
00:46:40,771 --> 00:46:41,760
interest in Ireland,

757
00:46:41,790 --> 00:46:46,110
but it was very much with the intention
of getting him away from England.

758
00:46:46,320 --> 00:46:47,250
Nevertheless,

759
00:46:47,340 --> 00:46:51,540
Richard made the most of his stay in
Ireland befriending the O'Neals and the

760
00:46:51,541 --> 00:46:53,880
north as well as the
kings have lunch there.

761
00:46:53,970 --> 00:46:58,260
This worried Henry as Richard was getting
the support of the Irish kings who

762
00:46:58,261 --> 00:47:00,480
were potentially aid him in a conflict.

763
00:47:00,540 --> 00:47:05,540
Richard left Ireland and 1450 placing
the Earl of Ormond James Butler in charge

764
00:47:05,821 --> 00:47:08,400
of the post. Unfortunately
for him, however,

765
00:47:08,460 --> 00:47:13,460
the Earl died in 1452 and his son
also named James a Lancastrian.

766
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:17,820
The rival faction of the Yorkist
succeeded him regardless.

767
00:47:17,940 --> 00:47:20,490
Richard had the majority of
the Irish supporting him.

768
00:47:20,700 --> 00:47:25,080
He had effectively done what the English
had long feared turned Ireland into a

769
00:47:25,081 --> 00:47:27,840
base from which a foreign
invasion could come.

770
00:47:28,140 --> 00:47:33,140
In 1453 Richard had returned to England
and took control of the throne while

771
00:47:33,341 --> 00:47:38,140
Henry was in the middle of
a mental breakdown. His rule
would not last. However,

772
00:47:38,260 --> 00:47:41,620
and while England came under
the rule of Henry again,

773
00:47:41,770 --> 00:47:46,300
Ireland continued to recognize Richard
as king, ignoring the rule of London,

774
00:47:46,301 --> 00:47:50,740
effectively making Ireland Independent.
Most of Ireland was with him,

775
00:47:50,741 --> 00:47:54,790
including primarily the Geraldine's
of Munster and killed there. However,

776
00:47:54,850 --> 00:47:56,920
the butlers in particular,
as I said,

777
00:47:57,010 --> 00:48:02,010
we're Lancastrians this divide would
rock Ireland as it did England in 1460

778
00:48:02,921 --> 00:48:07,270
Richard returned to England securing an
agreement that he would succeed Henry to

779
00:48:07,271 --> 00:48:10,000
six but it didn't last
and the work continued.

780
00:48:10,150 --> 00:48:14,380
Richard would die at the
battle of Wakefield and be
succeeded by his son Edward

781
00:48:14,381 --> 00:48:16,010
and his efforts who would later for us,

782
00:48:16,011 --> 00:48:19,000
Henry to exile in Scotland
in Ireland events,

783
00:48:19,001 --> 00:48:22,660
we're culminating toward the battle
of kill town where the Geraldine's and

784
00:48:22,661 --> 00:48:25,210
Butler's would face off,
but York aside,

785
00:48:25,270 --> 00:48:29,770
when and the Butler's would never recover.
Ensuring Geraldine power in Ireland,

786
00:48:29,980 --> 00:48:30,701
Thomas fits.

787
00:48:30,701 --> 00:48:34,630
James Fitzgerald was may head of the
Irish government during this time.

788
00:48:34,631 --> 00:48:37,840
Accordingly. As the Yorkist
Irish increase their wealth,

789
00:48:37,990 --> 00:48:42,280
he was much more of an Irishman then
an Englishman and favorite traditional

790
00:48:42,281 --> 00:48:47,281
Irish culture and law except in Dublin
where English rule was emphasized in 1466

791
00:48:48,461 --> 00:48:51,250
he was removed from power
by the O'Connors, however,

792
00:48:51,310 --> 00:48:55,900
and was later executed on false charges,
which caused further conflict.

793
00:48:56,110 --> 00:48:58,680
Unfortunately for the Irish,
the Len Castro,

794
00:48:58,681 --> 00:49:03,280
Ian's once again gained power in England
about the Irish remained Yorkist.

795
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:07,690
It would not be long before the throne
went back to the Yorkist again and Gerald

796
00:49:07,691 --> 00:49:12,580
became Earl of Kildare. Gerald would
be known as Jared, more Garrett,

797
00:49:12,581 --> 00:49:17,470
the great in Ireland, effectively ruling
as king in all but name under Gerald.

798
00:49:17,530 --> 00:49:20,530
The war and conflict
continued in many parts.

799
00:49:20,680 --> 00:49:23,950
Ireland entered a short
period of development,

800
00:49:23,980 --> 00:49:25,990
trade and relative peace.

801
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:31,200
This began to change again in 1485 when
Henry tutor a Lancastrian finally ended

802
00:49:32,801 --> 00:49:35,320
the war of the roses by securing throne.

803
00:49:38,260 --> 00:49:42,370
He did not rule as a Len Castro
in technically rather as a tutor,

804
00:49:42,430 --> 00:49:46,330
which was meant to be a house
which unified it to. However,

805
00:49:46,360 --> 00:49:51,070
his physician still meant that he viewed
the Irish who had opposed him with

806
00:49:51,071 --> 00:49:52,630
contempt.
Nevertheless,

807
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:57,720
he allowed Gerald to keep his position
knowing it because unnecessary and taxing

808
00:49:58,061 --> 00:50:01,240
problems in Ireland if he did not.
Despite this luck,

809
00:50:01,300 --> 00:50:06,300
Gerald and other Irish York is favored
a suppose it error to the York.

810
00:50:06,311 --> 00:50:09,880
His throne Lambert signal
who was in reality of fake,

811
00:50:09,881 --> 00:50:14,881
which Gerald probably new to replace
Henry to seventh and actually invaded

812
00:50:15,011 --> 00:50:18,640
England to secure this Henry
and crushed the invasion,

813
00:50:18,700 --> 00:50:21,670
but pardoned both Gerald
and Lambert and Gerald,

814
00:50:21,730 --> 00:50:24,970
who indeed had the luck of the
Irish returned to his post.

815
00:50:25,120 --> 00:50:29,630
Henry would later send an
army into Ireland when the
possibility of yet another

816
00:50:29,631 --> 00:50:34,631
threat from a fake air came and then
1492 Gerald was temporarily removed from

817
00:50:35,181 --> 00:50:36,014
office,

818
00:50:36,020 --> 00:50:40,630
though he likely wasn't involved in this
plot is disloyalty in the past wasn't

819
00:50:40,631 --> 00:50:41,660
enough justification.

820
00:50:41,840 --> 00:50:46,160
This period saw a resurgence of conflict
with the Butler's making a grab for

821
00:50:46,161 --> 00:50:50,000
power. Now the Geraldine's had
been to post this conflict,

822
00:50:50,030 --> 00:50:54,620
would concern Henry who sends an army
into Ireland again and would put Sir

823
00:50:54,621 --> 00:50:59,621
Edward pointings in charge
of administration to work
alongside Gerald Ehrlich

824
00:50:59,780 --> 00:51:04,490
Codera who returned to power
as the English realized
he was a necessary evil in

825
00:51:04,491 --> 00:51:04,971
stable.

826
00:51:04,971 --> 00:51:09,770
The governing Ireland pointings would
bring an end to any concept of Irish self

827
00:51:09,771 --> 00:51:11,690
rule.
During the war of the roses,

828
00:51:11,720 --> 00:51:15,050
Arland had been making many
of his own decisions and laws,

829
00:51:15,051 --> 00:51:19,340
but now it had to go through the approval
of the king in England and could no

830
00:51:19,341 --> 00:51:21,350
longer be diversified locally.

831
00:51:21,560 --> 00:51:26,390
This would begin a reversal and
England's gradual loss of Ireland until

832
00:51:26,391 --> 00:51:31,310
pointings Arland had gradually
been slipping from England
ever since the time of

833
00:51:31,311 --> 00:51:35,630
the Normans to the point at which it
began operating independently in all but

834
00:51:35,631 --> 00:51:36,710
name.
Once again,

835
00:51:36,980 --> 00:51:41,540
when Henry the seventh died in 1509
his son Henry the eighth would further

836
00:51:41,541 --> 00:51:44,540
transform the relationship
between England and Ireland,

837
00:51:44,600 --> 00:51:46,640
bringing the two nations closer together,

838
00:51:46,670 --> 00:51:49,880
but also driving the two
peoples further apart.

839
00:51:50,030 --> 00:51:54,620
Henry the eighth is remembered as one of
the most important monarchs in English

840
00:51:54,621 --> 00:51:57,080
history.
Those certainly controversial.

841
00:51:57,260 --> 00:52:01,940
Henry's main legacy begins with the
troubles of producing an error with his

842
00:52:01,941 --> 00:52:06,860
first wife Catherine of Aragon,
Catherine fail to give Henry a male heir.

843
00:52:06,861 --> 00:52:10,790
After seven children, all of them
died young except for their daughter.

844
00:52:10,820 --> 00:52:15,820
Mary Henry realized Katheryn wouldn't
likely produce a male heir and thus wanted

845
00:52:16,881 --> 00:52:17,570
a divorce,

846
00:52:17,570 --> 00:52:22,310
which was a rare and often impossible
concept in the 16th century,

847
00:52:22,311 --> 00:52:27,080
especially among the ability the pope
with pressure from the Spanish who wanted

848
00:52:27,081 --> 00:52:28,790
their marriage with England and tact.

849
00:52:28,820 --> 00:52:32,360
Catherine was actually the daughter
of Ferdinand and Isabella of Spain,

850
00:52:32,630 --> 00:52:37,630
denied it outright and thus
Henry desperate for a male
heir joins the Protestant

851
00:52:37,881 --> 00:52:42,560
reformation occurring in Europe and makes
himself the head of his own Anglican

852
00:52:42,561 --> 00:52:46,010
church effectively breaking
off from the Catholic Church.

853
00:52:46,190 --> 00:52:51,190
In July of 1533 Henry was
excommunicated and Catholic Europe,

854
00:52:51,320 --> 00:52:56,000
namely Spain, was beginning to
view England as bitterly hostile.

855
00:52:56,120 --> 00:53:00,440
Henry's church will be founded in blood
as he beheaded citizens who favored the

856
00:53:00,441 --> 00:53:05,090
pope officials who questioned his
power and even some of his own wives.

857
00:53:05,240 --> 00:53:09,920
Catholicism was not to be tolerated.
And with Ireland under pointings law,

858
00:53:09,980 --> 00:53:14,980
Arland was expected to follow through as
well by the Irish would resist and saw

859
00:53:14,991 --> 00:53:17,390
this as an opportunity for rebellion.

860
00:53:17,750 --> 00:53:21,500
Rebellion would come under Thomas
Fitzgerald, Earl of Kildare,

861
00:53:21,560 --> 00:53:26,430
known as silk and Thomas whose father
had been imprisoned and killed by Henry

862
00:53:26,430 --> 00:53:28,260
Henry.
Plan to execute Thomas as well.

863
00:53:28,290 --> 00:53:32,520
But Thomas took up arms and he declared
Henry a heretic and launched three

864
00:53:32,540 --> 00:53:34,830
called a holy crusade against him.

865
00:53:35,010 --> 00:53:37,590
He was met by Sir William Skellington,

866
00:53:37,620 --> 00:53:41,520
who commanded a forest of
around 2,300 well equipped men.

867
00:53:41,670 --> 00:53:44,160
Silken Thomas was
defeated by skipping done.

868
00:53:44,250 --> 00:53:49,080
Thomas along with much of his family and
scores of his supporters were executed

869
00:53:49,081 --> 00:53:53,460
by Henry shortly after the situation
in Ireland remained unresolved,

870
00:53:53,461 --> 00:53:57,690
though the Pale naturally followed
in step with Henry's movements.

871
00:53:57,780 --> 00:54:02,780
But Ireland outside the pail was much
less loyal and Catholicism remained firmly

872
00:54:03,451 --> 00:54:04,200
rooted.

873
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:08,790
Henry's sent forces into
Ireland to attempt to bring
them more firmly under his

874
00:54:08,791 --> 00:54:10,710
rule under Lord Leonard Grey.

875
00:54:10,860 --> 00:54:15,860
But grey was opposed by a coalition of
Irish lords known as the Geraldine leak

876
00:54:16,530 --> 00:54:18,360
orchestrated by menace. Uh, Donald,

877
00:54:18,540 --> 00:54:23,250
the League managed to even pillage the
Pale but was eventually put down by Lord

878
00:54:23,251 --> 00:54:27,090
grey. In 1539, Henry, as was his style,

879
00:54:27,120 --> 00:54:32,040
later had lord grey executed and switch
to a tactic of negotiation with the

880
00:54:32,041 --> 00:54:32,730
Irish.

881
00:54:32,730 --> 00:54:37,440
He encouraged them to surrender and
swear loyalty to the crown and agree to

882
00:54:37,441 --> 00:54:41,070
follow English law, customs,
and culture. In return,

883
00:54:41,130 --> 00:54:44,220
he would guarantee them their
lands under English law,

884
00:54:44,310 --> 00:54:49,230
grant them in English title and insure
them a place in Anglo Irish government.

885
00:54:49,260 --> 00:54:51,540
This offer applied to both Anglo,

886
00:54:51,541 --> 00:54:56,160
Irish and native Irish in an attempt
to bring control to the whole country.

887
00:54:56,370 --> 00:54:56,720
Ahmed,

888
00:54:56,720 --> 00:55:01,620
these changes to Irish
society and increase English
presence in rural Ireland.

889
00:55:01,650 --> 00:55:06,390
Henry, change this title from Lord
of Ireland to King of Ireland.

890
00:55:06,510 --> 00:55:10,890
This was effectively much more than a
change of title Ireland and England were

891
00:55:10,891 --> 00:55:15,450
now more clearly joined under a single
monarch and the Irish Lords had a much

892
00:55:15,451 --> 00:55:17,040
more clearer legal position.

893
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:21,720
Henry was eager to rural Ireland more
closely and began a process that would

894
00:55:21,721 --> 00:55:26,721
begin to draw Arland closer to England
after centuries of lackluster effort in

895
00:55:27,121 --> 00:55:31,440
Ireland by the English. Why would Henry
begin turning things around? Well,

896
00:55:31,560 --> 00:55:35,580
from the war of the roses, you learned
the importance of controlling Ireland.

897
00:55:35,700 --> 00:55:40,080
A hostile Ireland had been the base
of not only Richard of York but later

898
00:55:40,081 --> 00:55:44,610
pretenders as well, and the Irish also
nearly overthrew the English monarchy.

899
00:55:44,670 --> 00:55:45,360
Furthermore,

900
00:55:45,360 --> 00:55:49,920
Henry knew that a religious divide would
threaten the stability and the Catholic

901
00:55:49,921 --> 00:55:52,200
Ireland what opened the
door for the Catholic,

902
00:55:52,201 --> 00:55:56,670
French and Spanish to use the island
against England. Despite these efforts.

903
00:55:56,671 --> 00:55:57,810
However,
as I said,

904
00:55:57,930 --> 00:56:02,930
Henry had little effect outside of the
pail and many Irish nobility agreed to

905
00:56:03,181 --> 00:56:07,440
the surrender and regret policy as
it's called and later ignored it.

906
00:56:07,560 --> 00:56:12,560
Henry died in 1547 he had laid claim to
all of Ireland and begin a process which

907
00:56:13,201 --> 00:56:15,060
would link the two countries further,

908
00:56:15,180 --> 00:56:19,800
but ultimately failed as many monarchs
had before him to brake control of the

909
00:56:19,801 --> 00:56:23,130
whole island. It would be his
successors who achieve that.

910
00:56:23,350 --> 00:56:26,440
And the next video we'll look at
the efforts of his short live son.

911
00:56:26,441 --> 00:56:27,730
Henry is daughters,

912
00:56:27,731 --> 00:56:32,470
Mary and Elizabeth and King James in
Ireland in a crucial period in English

913
00:56:32,471 --> 00:56:33,070
history.

914
00:56:33,070 --> 00:56:37,510
We'll look at how Ireland functioned
under English and eventually British rule

915
00:56:37,720 --> 00:56:42,190
and it's uneasy role and the empire which
would come to dominate the world and

916
00:56:42,191 --> 00:56:46,210
later its effort to break off from that
empire once and for all and become the

917
00:56:46,211 --> 00:56:47,590
nation it is today.

918
00:56:47,830 --> 00:56:52,830
Or rather nations as the island remains
divided for reasons we'll get into if

919
00:56:53,291 --> 00:56:55,780
you enjoyed this video.
I have made others like it.

920
00:56:55,810 --> 00:57:00,190
We fully cover the history of England
and the United States in a similar way,

921
00:57:00,250 --> 00:57:04,360
and I've done other documentaries on
history such as the ones on the dark ages

922
00:57:04,361 --> 00:57:05,194
and the vikings.

923
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:09,010
I've also done documentaries on
subjects like the history of coffee,

924
00:57:09,040 --> 00:57:12,070
the science of dreams,
the Science of aliens and terraforming,

925
00:57:12,190 --> 00:57:16,750
and the whole array of video is on other
subjects and at of course invite you to

926
00:57:16,751 --> 00:57:21,730
come check them out on my channel to be
updated on part two as well as the keep

927
00:57:21,731 --> 00:57:24,370
up with many videos like
this coming up in the future.

928
00:57:24,430 --> 00:57:28,300
I invite you to subscribe to fire
of learning. Thank you for watching.
