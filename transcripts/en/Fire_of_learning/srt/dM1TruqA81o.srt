00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,030
Hello and welcome to
fire of learning coffee,

2
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:05,700
one of the world's most
valued commodities.

3
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:10,020
The 25 million people employed in
the coffee industry in some form,

4
00:00:10,021 --> 00:00:15,021
produced a 9.3 million tons of coffee
beans worldwide each year and help turn it

5
00:00:15,451 --> 00:00:17,370
into the 500 billion cups of coffee.

6
00:00:17,371 --> 00:00:20,460
We consume yearly in a
variety of ways and styles.

7
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:25,080
All this consumption has made coffee
the second most traded commodity in the

8
00:00:25,081 --> 00:00:26,310
world after oil,

9
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:30,600
but the drink that some of us now feel
that we need every day was not always

10
00:00:30,601 --> 00:00:31,830
there.
In fact,

11
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:35,490
it's a recent addition to
the world compared with many
other drinks and products.

12
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:40,880
The relationship between coffee and
people has more humble origins as a wild

13
00:00:41,161 --> 00:00:44,910
plant here in east Africa today,
Ethiopia,

14
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:50,840
the story of coffee begins in the ninth
century and there are legends that an

15
00:00:51,331 --> 00:00:56,160
Ethiopian goat herder named Caldy noticed
it as goats had become very energetic

16
00:00:56,161 --> 00:00:58,980
after having consumed the berries,
have a strange plant,

17
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:01,880
which we now know to be
coffee berries called.

18
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:06,390
He then tried the berries and after
having been surprised by the enjoyable,

19
00:01:06,391 --> 00:01:07,830
energetic feeling that came,

20
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:12,240
brought them to a nearby Islamic
monk who first tried to burn them and

21
00:01:12,241 --> 00:01:13,074
disapproval,

22
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:16,710
but then noticed a pleasurable smell
coming from the seeds from within the

23
00:01:16,711 --> 00:01:20,790
roasted coffee berries and then ground
up and dissolve the emmers into water,

24
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:25,500
creating the first cup of coffee from
their coffee spread across these Islamic

25
00:01:25,501 --> 00:01:26,334
world.

26
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:30,690
The story was almost certainly made up
perhaps a thousand years or so after its

27
00:01:30,691 --> 00:01:31,740
claim to take place,

28
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:36,360
but it's probably true that Ethiopians
had discovered the unique effects of the

29
00:01:36,361 --> 00:01:40,560
barriers of the cafe. A plant around
the time that the legend takes place,

30
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:43,500
the knowledge of this
and the beans themselves,

31
00:01:43,501 --> 00:01:46,420
which aren't technically beans by the way,
just look alikes.

32
00:01:46,490 --> 00:01:51,490
They're seasoned fact probably soon
enter the nearby Islamic world within a

33
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:55,020
century or so though the actual drink
we know and love would not be made for a

34
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:55,853
few centuries to come.

35
00:01:56,070 --> 00:02:00,900
That story takes place across the Red
Sea and a country none then and now as

36
00:02:00,901 --> 00:02:01,734
Yemen.

37
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:06,480
The stimulating effects of coffee beans
were possibly first described by an

38
00:02:06,481 --> 00:02:09,450
Arabic polymath named
Muhammad ibn Zachariah.

39
00:02:09,451 --> 00:02:14,451
I'll Razi or more simply Rosie's
around 900 a d though it was definitely

40
00:02:15,271 --> 00:02:19,370
mentioned by the Persian polymath
I Ali [inaudible] or [inaudible].

41
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:22,350
Later that century,
around this time period,

42
00:02:22,351 --> 00:02:26,580
Islamic monks began cultivating a plant
and turning the fermenting berries into

43
00:02:26,581 --> 00:02:28,620
a kind of wine,
none as Kesher.

44
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:33,270
The first evidence of coffee as the
drink we know made similarly to how it is

45
00:02:33,271 --> 00:02:34,200
made today in fact,

46
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:39,470
comes from the 14 hundreds it is not
known who first invented it or where

47
00:02:39,481 --> 00:02:41,010
exactly it was invented.

48
00:02:41,011 --> 00:02:45,600
Some ambiguous reports say it was a
Muslim chic named Jamal, all dean,

49
00:02:45,601 --> 00:02:50,601
all the Bonnie and 1454 but the first
clear reports of it come from Sufi Muslim

50
00:02:50,821 --> 00:02:55,470
monks again in Yemen who used a drink
to stay awake the night for religious

51
00:02:55,471 --> 00:02:56,304
purposes.

52
00:02:56,550 --> 00:03:01,210
It would then be spread rapidly across
the Arabian peninsula and into the rest

53
00:03:01,211 --> 00:03:02,230
of these Islamic world.

54
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:07,390
By the year of 1500 people were drinking
coffee from North Africa to Turkey to

55
00:03:07,391 --> 00:03:11,740
Persia, all originating from
the Yemeni port. City of Mocha.

56
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:13,750
I named carried with coffee to this day.

57
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:17,050
The meanies would take great
care to protect their trade,

58
00:03:17,051 --> 00:03:21,040
requiring all coffee beans to be boiled
and sterilized before it can be shipped

59
00:03:21,041 --> 00:03:24,220
out to foreign lands. Though
of course, as we shall see,

60
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:27,970
it would not be protected forever.
No one knew it then of course,

61
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,470
but the stimulating effects,

62
00:03:29,471 --> 00:03:33,220
which may coffees or popular come
from a drug within it. Caffeine,

63
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:38,520
caffeine like nicotine and morphine in
fact evolved in the end susters of the

64
00:03:38,921 --> 00:03:41,950
cafe. A plant as a way to
keep insects from eating it.

65
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:46,840
Insects which consumed a plant were
killed by the effects of caffeine. So yes,

66
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:51,190
Caffeine essentially originated
as an insecticide. Thankfully,

67
00:03:51,191 --> 00:03:54,490
it's effects on humans and
other animals are less toxic.

68
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:59,610
It's stimulating effects on humans come
firstly from the fact that it mimics a

69
00:03:59,741 --> 00:04:04,150
chemical release in our brains
known as adenosine. Simply put,

70
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:06,530
as we go about our days
and energy is released,

71
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,560
adenosine builds up in our brains.

72
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:12,610
The more identizine which builds up
the sleepier, you get as of course,

73
00:04:12,611 --> 00:04:16,780
as process signals to your brain as you
had been using energy. Caffeine, however,

74
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:21,430
is molecularly very similar to identizine
and it's capable of binding to the

75
00:04:21,431 --> 00:04:22,990
adenosine receptors in the brain,

76
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:27,850
but it's not similar enough to activate
them just to block the identizine from

77
00:04:27,851 --> 00:04:31,750
the receptors and therefore prevents you
from feeling the tiredness that you'd

78
00:04:31,751 --> 00:04:32,740
actually be feeling.

79
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:36,040
The world's most consumed drug
does more than just this though.

80
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:40,300
It's effects also lead to an increase
of adrenaline which increases heart rate

81
00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:42,790
blood flow and creates
a feeling of energy.

82
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:45,640
It also helps release
dopamine which improves mood.

83
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,300
All of these factors encouraged.

84
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:51,700
The popularity of a drink is one which
improves mood, energy, focus and thinking.

85
00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:52,840
However,
as I said,

86
00:04:52,841 --> 00:04:56,650
no one at the time knew anything about
this as caffeine wouldn't be identified.

87
00:04:56,651 --> 00:05:00,540
In fact until 1819 by the German chemists,
free league,

88
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:04,270
Ferdinand Ruena throughout
the 16th century coffee.

89
00:05:04,271 --> 00:05:09,070
We continue to gain popularity in the
Middle East with mixed reception's not

90
00:05:09,071 --> 00:05:09,730
everyone,

91
00:05:09,730 --> 00:05:14,470
particularly Orthodox Islamic and moms
liked it and its effects along with the

92
00:05:14,471 --> 00:05:18,790
fact that coffee houses in the Middle
East typically allowed prostitution,

93
00:05:18,791 --> 00:05:23,110
astrology, and other things which
weren't necessarily appreciated by Islam,

94
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:27,790
led to it being banned and multiple
places on several occasions such as Mecca

95
00:05:27,791 --> 00:05:32,791
and 1511 and Cairo and 1532 but it was
too late for the opponents of coffee.

96
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:36,760
As many including powerful
leaders like the Ottoman Sultan,

97
00:05:36,761 --> 00:05:39,820
Suleiman the first had
already taken a liking to it.

98
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:44,470
Leaders like Solomont across the Islamic
world overturned many of these bands

99
00:05:44,471 --> 00:05:46,690
and press for copies.
Acceptance in Islam,

100
00:05:47,170 --> 00:05:50,020
coffee began to reach
Europe a few decades later.

101
00:05:50,170 --> 00:05:54,970
Europeans first reportedly encountered
coffee on the island of Malta where the

102
00:05:54,971 --> 00:05:57,740
knights of Saint John
Having taken Ottoman Turks,

103
00:05:57,741 --> 00:05:59,600
slaves during the great siege of Malta,

104
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:03,440
founders slaves repairing a drink and
try it, some of it for themselves.

105
00:06:03,441 --> 00:06:08,441
And 1565 in 1573 coffee was described
by a traveling botanists and physician

106
00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:15,860
named Laonard rivals who called Shaba.
While in Aleppo,

107
00:06:15,861 --> 00:06:20,750
he wrote a beverage as black as inc
useful against numerous illnesses,

108
00:06:20,751 --> 00:06:24,680
particularly those at the stomach.
It's consumers take it in the morning,

109
00:06:24,681 --> 00:06:29,150
quite frankly in a porcelain cup that
has passed around and from which each one

110
00:06:29,151 --> 00:06:30,110
drinks a cupful.

111
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:35,060
It is composed of water and the fruit
from a Bush called Buena Buena wasn't

112
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:38,450
named the Ethiopians gave to the
plant which was described in Arabic.

113
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:43,610
Though the Arabic word for coffee at the
time was cowatch not long after in the

114
00:06:43,611 --> 00:06:47,930
1580s and nineties as the Venetians
began increasing a trade with the Muslim

115
00:06:47,931 --> 00:06:51,800
world, coffee found its way
to mainland Europe from Italy,

116
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:57,160
the Arabic word Koala became Covey in
Turkish and Italian became cafe and French

117
00:06:58,731 --> 00:07:03,731
cafe and other languages took on similar
names becoming coffee and English as in

118
00:07:04,791 --> 00:07:08,510
the Muslim world. The Christian world
also reacted hesitantly to coffee.

119
00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:12,440
Many people enjoyed it and it spread
rapidly through the continent,

120
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:17,570
but many criticize it, calling it a Muslim
drink or even a better drink of Satan.

121
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:22,610
Debate would last over the drink until
about 1600 when Pope Clement the eighth

122
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:25,580
who his reign was marked by
conflict with the Muslim Turks,

123
00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:29,390
tried the drink and light enough
to declare it a Christian drink.

124
00:07:29,570 --> 00:07:33,410
Throughout the 16 hundreds coffee became
a hot commodity in Europe and many

125
00:07:33,411 --> 00:07:37,910
trading companies focused on importing it.
Coffeehouses opened up across Europe,

126
00:07:37,911 --> 00:07:42,620
the first one on mainland Europe outside
the Ottoman Empire being in Venice in

127
00:07:42,621 --> 00:07:47,621
1645 the Yemenis had tried to
safeguard the production of coffee,

128
00:07:47,751 --> 00:07:49,880
but of course failed in their endeavors.

129
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:55,420
Attempts to smuggle live coffee seeds
out of Yemen and creased in 1616 of the

130
00:07:55,551 --> 00:07:59,330
Dutch succeeded in doing it and attempted
to grow the plant in their homeland

131
00:07:59,331 --> 00:08:04,130
and in their colonies in modern day Sri
Lanka and Java and would later focus on

132
00:08:04,131 --> 00:08:07,950
the production in the East indies.
The Dutch would begin to spread coffee.

133
00:08:07,951 --> 00:08:11,990
Third Trade to places like Japan
as well. The plant, of course,

134
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:16,310
prefers a tropical climate and 60th
70th Sophie monk smuggled several coffee

135
00:08:16,311 --> 00:08:20,480
beans from Yemen to India
and to the Kingdom of Mysore
where the plants grew and

136
00:08:20,481 --> 00:08:22,340
not only successfully remain there,

137
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:26,720
but allow the plant and a drink to be
eventually successfully spread across the

138
00:08:26,721 --> 00:08:28,970
world.
From the Americas to the east.

139
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:32,690
Assisting the spread was
the failed siege of Vienna,

140
00:08:32,710 --> 00:08:36,200
where in the victorious European
forces looting Ottoman camps,

141
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:39,050
discovered coffee beans that
had been brought with them.

142
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:42,920
They'll coffee had been declared a
Christian drink and spread across Europe

143
00:08:42,921 --> 00:08:45,770
rapidly.
Coffeehouses were a different story.

144
00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:51,070
It's perhaps ironic that the introduction
of coffee to Europe correlated closely

145
00:08:51,261 --> 00:08:52,880
with the age of enlightenment,

146
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:57,240
but it is indeed true that
many enlightenment thinkers
across Europe met at

147
00:08:57,241 --> 00:09:00,810
coffee houses to discuss a number
of topics including social,

148
00:09:00,811 --> 00:09:05,130
political and religious reform. The famous
French enlightenment thinker Voltaire,

149
00:09:05,131 --> 00:09:09,210
for example, is said to have drank
up to 80 cups of coffee a day.

150
00:09:09,570 --> 00:09:13,200
The monarchs of Europe would attempt to
crack down on seditious and rebellious

151
00:09:13,201 --> 00:09:17,340
talk and activity during the
enlightenment. Some such as Charles.

152
00:09:17,341 --> 00:09:20,220
The second of England would
target these coffee houses,

153
00:09:20,221 --> 00:09:22,350
specifically closing many of them down.

154
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:27,600
The French Naval Officer Gabrielle declaw
is often credited with having spread

155
00:09:27,601 --> 00:09:32,601
coffee plants to the Americas in 1720
accounts telephone him nurturing a coffee

156
00:09:33,211 --> 00:09:36,600
plant during a voyage, sharing
his water ration with it. In fact,

157
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:41,490
until he was able to plant it in a French
colony of Martinique where it came to

158
00:09:41,491 --> 00:09:46,020
be the ancestor of huge amounts of the
coffee plants grown today. However,

159
00:09:46,050 --> 00:09:49,800
we now know that coffee was growing into
French colonies. A sound a mean now,

160
00:09:49,801 --> 00:09:53,820
modern day Heidi and the Dutch colony
of Suriname just a few years prior.

161
00:09:54,030 --> 00:09:58,110
Regardless, Duclos efforts are an
important moment in coffee history.

162
00:09:58,290 --> 00:10:02,460
The production of coffee though having
many different methods across the world,

163
00:10:02,461 --> 00:10:06,750
essentially boils down to the same steps
and has since its creation and Yemen.

164
00:10:07,170 --> 00:10:11,910
Coffee, as I said, originates from
the cafe trees. Within a few years,

165
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:15,330
the tree begins producing
fruits known as Coffee Cherries.

166
00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:19,590
These trees can live to be up to six
years old when the cherries are ready.

167
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:24,060
The seeds are separated from the first
through a variety of methods. These seeds,

168
00:10:24,061 --> 00:10:29,061
as aforementioned are the coffee beans
there are left to dry out in the sun and

169
00:10:29,101 --> 00:10:31,350
then a coding none.
As parchment is removed,

170
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:35,610
the seeds are then roasted and then
ground up at the end of this process.

171
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:38,460
One is left with coffee grounds,
right to make coffee with.

172
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:40,950
While coffee had become popular in Europe,

173
00:10:40,951 --> 00:10:44,880
it's still also has to compete with tea
and alcohol and a number of other drinks.

174
00:10:45,090 --> 00:10:49,050
In colonial America in particular,
it was not very popular at first.

175
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:53,970
That is of course until the 1770s during
the revolutionary war when t became a

176
00:10:53,971 --> 00:10:56,730
product,
very much associated with Britishness.

177
00:10:57,330 --> 00:11:00,690
I'm sure a fellow American viewers can
think of famous incidents such as the

178
00:11:00,691 --> 00:11:05,550
Boston tea party. As an example,
coffee became a popular alternative.

179
00:11:05,610 --> 00:11:09,870
However, it was in short supply and
prices rose considerably. Nevertheless,

180
00:11:09,930 --> 00:11:11,730
from the foundation of the country,

181
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:16,470
protests of tea and the coffee becoming
what is culturally seen as America's

182
00:11:16,471 --> 00:11:17,490
choice of caffeine,

183
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:21,630
though rather popular now and
spread across five continents,

184
00:11:21,930 --> 00:11:25,980
coffee was still not exactly
cheap and was available regularly.

185
00:11:26,010 --> 00:11:29,910
Only still wealthier and the ability
that would begin to change. However,

186
00:11:29,911 --> 00:11:34,911
in the 19th century following Brazil's
independence from Portugal and 1822

187
00:11:35,730 --> 00:11:40,440
expanding the coffee industry was very
much seen as an opportunity to encourage

188
00:11:40,441 --> 00:11:42,300
the new nation's economic growth.

189
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:46,380
It did so I'll be it unfortunately in
the beginning from the work of slaves

190
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:51,560
which led to Brazil being the last western
nation to outlaw slavery in 1888 but

191
00:11:51,931 --> 00:11:56,931
Brazil's coffee had led the coffee
becoming a drink of the masses or in other

192
00:11:57,221 --> 00:12:00,610
words, a cup of Joe. Once
coffee production is plentiful,

193
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:04,810
people were quick to regularly consume it.
A trend which never went away,

194
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:10,210
it would be a breakfast food for average
citizens are recreational drink fuel

195
00:12:10,211 --> 00:12:13,450
for the productiveness of the world
for soldiers and laborers as well as

196
00:12:13,451 --> 00:12:16,360
philosophers and scientists I drink,

197
00:12:16,361 --> 00:12:20,080
which was made in the Arabian peninsula
from the seeds of plant found in

198
00:12:20,081 --> 00:12:24,070
Ethiopia, is now regularly consumed
and available across the world.

199
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:25,121
To this day,

200
00:12:25,121 --> 00:12:28,990
Brazil remains the number one producer
of coffee in the world producing about a

201
00:12:28,991 --> 00:12:32,140
third of all the world's
coffee or about 3 million tons.

202
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:36,850
It is followed by Vietnam and second
place at one and a half million tons,

203
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:42,180
Columbia and third with 750,000
Indonesia and fourth at 640,000 tons and

204
00:12:44,111 --> 00:12:49,060
Ethiopia, the home of the coffee
plant in fifth place at 470,000 tons.

205
00:12:49,330 --> 00:12:53,170
The two main varieties of coffee
grown our Arabica and Robusta.

206
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:58,680
These major producers along with many
other significant producers unsurprisingly

207
00:12:58,871 --> 00:13:00,730
are located in a region of the earth,

208
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:05,290
ideal for the growth and health of the
cafe. A plant known as the coffee belt.

209
00:13:05,530 --> 00:13:09,970
Coffee has never been more diversified
than it is today with many kinds and

210
00:13:09,971 --> 00:13:10,804
tastes.

211
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:16,200
Many additions like milk or to use the
Italian word for milk Latte as well as

212
00:13:16,211 --> 00:13:20,530
cream and sugar originated in Europe
in the 17th and 18th centuries.

213
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,960
From these simple combinations,

214
00:13:22,990 --> 00:13:26,080
coffee and its varieties
would diversify greatly.

215
00:13:26,350 --> 00:13:30,130
There are even now coffee flavored
things like coffee flavored ice cream and

216
00:13:30,131 --> 00:13:30,964
cake.

217
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:35,770
A common kind of coffee is decaffeinated
coffee as you might guess for the name

218
00:13:35,771 --> 00:13:40,300
coffee without caffeine or in reality,
just a small amount of caffeine.

219
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:45,600
The process of removing caffeine from
coffee was discovered in 1903 by accident

220
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:47,860
by a German merchant named Ludvig.

221
00:13:47,861 --> 00:13:52,710
Rebellious Caffeine is removed from
the unroasted beans using solvents or a

222
00:13:52,711 --> 00:13:56,940
times just water. It is not made from
the roots of the plant economists.

223
00:13:57,340 --> 00:14:02,340
The amount of caffeine in a cup of coffee
is usually about 95 milligrams per cup

224
00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:06,400
or per eight ounces. Though it of
course varies greatly. Comparatively,

225
00:14:06,401 --> 00:14:11,230
there are anywhere from 70
to 115 milligrams of caffeine
in a cup of an average

226
00:14:11,231 --> 00:14:15,280
energy drink, 40 milligrams in an
average cup of tea, 40 milligrams,

227
00:14:15,281 --> 00:14:19,780
and a cup of most soda beverages in
about five milligrams in decaf coffee.

228
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:22,870
Plain coffee itself is
not really nutritious,

229
00:14:23,050 --> 00:14:26,920
but the caffeine in it carries a
number of health effects. As I said,

230
00:14:26,921 --> 00:14:29,410
the drug has a number
of effects on people.

231
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:33,760
Generally these are positive
increasing energy, focus, attention,

232
00:14:33,761 --> 00:14:36,340
mood and motivation.
Though for many,

233
00:14:36,341 --> 00:14:40,120
most notably people with anxiety disorders
though those without them as well.

234
00:14:40,130 --> 00:14:44,380
Sometimes it can be negative as an
increase in adrenaline and other factors

235
00:14:44,381 --> 00:14:47,830
create anxiety, nervousness,
jitteriness and his comfort.

236
00:14:48,130 --> 00:14:49,690
The higher the dose of caffeine.

237
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:54,200
The more one is at risk developing these
symptoms as well as sweating insomnia,

238
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:57,770
indigestion, headaches and
nausea, scientific studies.

239
00:14:57,771 --> 00:15:01,130
How predominantly shown however,
that a normal consumption of coffee,

240
00:15:01,190 --> 00:15:02,720
even a few cups every day,

241
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:06,680
is not detrimental to the health
of the average person. Further,

242
00:15:06,681 --> 00:15:09,230
a specific study on coffee is lacking.
However,

243
00:15:09,650 --> 00:15:13,550
studies suggests that coffee consumption
may extend your life and improve

244
00:15:13,570 --> 00:15:14,780
brainpower.
However,

245
00:15:14,781 --> 00:15:19,580
it is not known exactly which illnesses
are staved off or how exactly this is

246
00:15:19,581 --> 00:15:22,070
done and only also a general doses.

247
00:15:22,490 --> 00:15:26,750
Regular excessive consumption of coffee
may have a negative effect on lifespan.

248
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:30,530
While a coffee may not
affect cancer much other way,

249
00:15:30,531 --> 00:15:32,330
it may be good for heart diseases.

250
00:15:32,870 --> 00:15:36,890
It is also possible that copy's slightly
lowers the risk of type two diabetes,

251
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:41,420
dementia and Parkinson's disease and
as an appetite suppressant may help you

252
00:15:41,421 --> 00:15:45,830
lose weight. It May, however, lead
to an increased risk of dry skin,

253
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:48,680
hypertension, osteoporosis, heart attack,

254
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:52,250
and may have a 14% increased
risk of lung cancer.

255
00:15:52,251 --> 00:15:56,180
Though this last one only amongst smokers.
As a result of all this.

256
00:15:56,450 --> 00:16:00,140
Caffeine is not recommended for
those with cardiovascular diseases,

257
00:16:00,170 --> 00:16:03,770
anxiety disorders, insomnia,
and other similar conditions.

258
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:07,460
The exact health effects on pregnant
women have yet to be determined.

259
00:16:07,610 --> 00:16:10,700
This is all quite a bit, but
caffeine is, as I've said,

260
00:16:10,730 --> 00:16:15,620
a fairly safe drug and if not consumed
and excessive amounts likely won't ever

261
00:16:15,621 --> 00:16:19,610
be a problem for most as is
usually the rule with drugs.

262
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:23,330
The higher you rise, the harder
you fall. Coffee's main ingredient.

263
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:27,590
Caffeine is not nearly as intense
as other stimulants like cocaine or

264
00:16:27,591 --> 00:16:32,591
amphetamines and its withdrawal symptoms
are likewise much lighter symptoms of

265
00:16:32,991 --> 00:16:36,200
caffeine. Withdrawal, however
typically include headaches, fatigue,

266
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:40,220
problems with concentration as well
as depressed mood, constipation,

267
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:43,190
muscle stiffness,
irritability as well as others.

268
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:45,920
So if you find yourself
wanting to give up coffee,

269
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:50,570
it might be easier to slowly cut back on
intake and then maybe switch to tea and

270
00:16:50,571 --> 00:16:55,160
then come back on t and so forth to
avoid caffeine. Withdrawal Coffee is,

271
00:16:55,161 --> 00:16:57,290
as I've said,
great for the economy.

272
00:16:57,380 --> 00:17:02,380
It accounts for 63% of Brazil's exports
just as an example and is therefore a

273
00:17:02,391 --> 00:17:05,570
main source of revenue for that
country as well as many others.

274
00:17:05,810 --> 00:17:07,580
It is important to note,
however,

275
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:10,850
coffee production does have a
negative effect on the environment.

276
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:15,200
It requires a considerable amount of
water which is problematic for dryer

277
00:17:15,201 --> 00:17:16,670
nations like Ethiopia.

278
00:17:17,210 --> 00:17:21,110
Traditional methods of growing coffee
along trees have also fallen out and its

279
00:17:21,111 --> 00:17:24,590
production increases deforestation
and habitat destruction.

280
00:17:24,950 --> 00:17:27,890
The use of pesticides is further
harmful to the environment.

281
00:17:27,891 --> 00:17:31,520
In fact that up to this point pesticides
have been even more harmful to the

282
00:17:31,521 --> 00:17:36,440
predators of paths and a pest themselves
creates an even bigger issue and all of

283
00:17:36,441 --> 00:17:40,370
these issues will have to be addressed
as the demand for coffee and the strains

284
00:17:40,371 --> 00:17:42,260
on the environment continue to grow.

285
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:47,000
Whether you're an occasional coffee
drinker needed every day or just have an

286
00:17:47,001 --> 00:17:50,190
interest in subject,
I hope enjoyed this video.

287
00:17:50,550 --> 00:17:53,790
Let me know in the comments section how
much coffee you drink to support the

288
00:17:53,791 --> 00:17:55,410
creation of more videos like these.

289
00:17:55,411 --> 00:17:58,230
A link to our patriotic we found
and a channel subscription.

290
00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:02,370
Any donation would be appreciated and
be put to use to improve the channel.

291
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:06,090
I will likely be covering the history
