Hello and welcome to fire of learning.
My name is Justin and I run the channel.

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:09,360
We are essentially an educational or
edutainment channel. What's our focus?

3
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:12,960
Well, quite honestly, we're open to
talking about all kinds of subjects,

4
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:16,350
but our main focus is on
history, the sciences, sociology,

5
00:00:16,351 --> 00:00:19,860
languages in subjects like what we
talk about in videos like these.

6
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:23,490
And I'd like to think that these videos
are only the beginning and as you can

7
00:00:23,491 --> 00:00:26,670
see, not only do we talk
about a variety of topics,

8
00:00:26,671 --> 00:00:30,390
but also in a variety of lengths.
Sometimes it's a quick rundown.

9
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:34,140
Other times I spent a good while
covering a subject and its entirety.

10
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:39,330
What makes fire of learning unique among
other channels? Well, a few things. One,

11
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:42,750
I leave my beliefs out
of my videos. Why? Well,

12
00:00:42,751 --> 00:00:45,120
I could do a whole video
on why and I likely will.

13
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:49,170
But the main reason is that it's not
my place to tell you how to think,

14
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:53,790
only to give you things to think about.
Not that I don't ever share any opinions,

15
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:58,470
but my politics, social
views, religion, all of that I
leave out too. It's all free.

16
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:01,920
And it always will be. If you
wanted to support us on our Patrion,

17
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:04,980
that'd be great. But if not, you'll
still have access to everything.

18
00:01:04,981 --> 00:01:07,590
I produce three,
I cover whole subjects,

19
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:11,310
but I tried to make them straight forward
and easy to understand without leaving

20
00:01:11,311 --> 00:01:14,670
the good stuff out. And if it's
not easy to understand, no worries.

21
00:01:14,671 --> 00:01:18,930
Because for I listened to you guys, I read
the comments, I get, I respond to you,

22
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:21,150
I pull you on your opinions,
that kind of thing.

23
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:23,190
So if this sounds interesting to you,

24
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:26,280
I'd invite you to come check us
out and subscribed by the way,

25
00:01:26,281 --> 00:01:27,870
because it covers so many topics.

26
00:01:27,871 --> 00:01:31,320
I tried to keep it organized in my
playlist section to help you navigate the

27
00:01:31,321 --> 00:01:35,580
channel. Also, I like to think that I've
gotten better at making videos over time.

28
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:38,520
So maybe start with the newer stuff.
Thanks everyone.
