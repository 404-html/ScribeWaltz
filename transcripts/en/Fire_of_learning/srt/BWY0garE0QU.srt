1
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:23,620
I do not know what I appears from
the world, but to my so it seemed,

2
00:00:23,621 --> 00:00:26,260
I've only been like a boy
playing on the seashore indef,

3
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:31,210
rooting myself and now and then finding
a smoother pebble or pretty show than

4
00:00:31,211 --> 00:00:32,044
ordinary.

5
00:00:32,710 --> 00:00:36,670
While the great ocean of truth
lay all undiscovered before me,

6
00:00:38,590 --> 00:00:43,590
Sir Isaac Newton was born on Christmas
Day 1642 it will store Lincolnshire

7
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:44,380
England.

8
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:47,770
He is regarded by many to have been the
greatest scientist who ever lived due to

9
00:00:47,771 --> 00:00:52,540
his contributions to physics, mathematics,
optics, astronomy, and many more fields.

10
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:57,850
His book philosophy and not Rally Spring
Cubia Mathematica and mathematical

11
00:00:57,851 --> 00:01:01,690
principles of natural philosophy
is regarded with equal esteem.

12
00:01:02,410 --> 00:01:05,920
Newton also spent much of his time with
religion coming the Bible for hidden

13
00:01:05,921 --> 00:01:09,670
meaning and with alchemy attempting
to find the philosopher's stone.

14
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:14,160
Newton was born at three months after
his father had died, was named after him.

15
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:16,890
He was born prematurely.
Ms Not expect to live but live.

16
00:01:16,891 --> 00:01:18,880
He did as the age of three newtons.

17
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:22,150
Mother left him to live
with his grandmother and she
went to live with Newton's

18
00:01:22,210 --> 00:01:27,120
new stepfather, angered Newton greatly.
Newton's early education began.

19
00:01:27,121 --> 00:01:31,140
At the king school in Grantham until
those mother widowed again. I'd returned.

20
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:32,850
She brought him home the farm,

21
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:36,840
but Newton would return to school becoming
a top of his class and becoming well

22
00:01:36,841 --> 00:01:41,841
known for his accomplishments and his
inventions and 1661 he was admitted to the

23
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:44,430
Trinity College at Cambridge.

24
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:48,420
It was here where he was educated in many
sciences and many mats and here where

25
00:01:48,421 --> 00:01:51,540
Newton invented calculus and 1665

26
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:53,053
okay.

27
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:56,860
It was also here that the famous falling
apple incident occurred leading Newton

28
00:01:56,861 --> 00:01:59,950
to his discovery of gravity.
There was no books revealed.

29
00:01:59,951 --> 00:02:01,360
He was already thinking of the subject.

30
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:05,320
Newton left Cambridge and 1665
is a great plague of London,

31
00:02:05,321 --> 00:02:10,321
which killed 25% of the population broke
out return in 1667 it wasn't 1667 also

32
00:02:13,811 --> 00:02:15,730
that Newton became a fellow of trinity.

33
00:02:15,731 --> 00:02:18,850
Though this position required new and
to become an ordained Anglican priest

34
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:19,931
privately,

35
00:02:19,931 --> 00:02:22,810
Newton had ideas that religion which
would have likely caused him trouble if

36
00:02:22,811 --> 00:02:23,644
publicized.

37
00:02:24,130 --> 00:02:27,340
He did not believe in the trinity and
often scour the Bible looking for hidden

38
00:02:27,341 --> 00:02:28,570
meeting as aforementioned.

39
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:33,770
Apparently Newton deciphered that the
world would end in the year 2060 but there

40
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:37,510
was no evidence to support this claim
for these reasons which Newton never

41
00:02:37,511 --> 00:02:41,170
revealed. He avoided the position with
special permission of Charles a second.

42
00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:44,170
Newton's work with
optics was also profound.

43
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,840
He worked with prisms and
explore light and color.

44
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:50,020
Discovering that white light be
split into many other colors.

45
00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:52,650
He also invented the first
reflecting telescope.

46
00:02:52,651 --> 00:02:54,250
I replacing a lens with a mirror.

47
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:58,240
Many of his optical discoveries
were putting his book optics.

48
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:00,310
Newton let a private life.

49
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:03,940
You're not going along with a few other
scientists of his day and could not

50
00:03:03,941 --> 00:03:05,140
stand criticism.

51
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:09,880
He was so struck by it that he was
reluctant to ever publish anything much of

52
00:03:09,881 --> 00:03:12,010
its work also would have
been dangerous to him.

53
00:03:12,011 --> 00:03:16,630
It publicized there's
religious explorations as well
as exploration of alchemy.

54
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:20,320
Newton searched heavily
for the philosopher's stone
and spent much of his time

55
00:03:20,321 --> 00:03:23,560
on alchemy that regarded
as a pseudoscience. Today.

56
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:27,250
Newton's undertaking of alchemy seems
to resemble more so an early form of

57
00:03:27,251 --> 00:03:28,084
chemistry.

58
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:33,250
In 1669 Newton you came to the carry
and professor of mathematics a position

59
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,110
more recently held by Stephen Hawking.

60
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:41,370
Years later in 1679 Newton regain an
interest in astronomical matters while

61
00:03:41,711 --> 00:03:44,200
corresponding with scientists
such as Robert Hook,

62
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:47,830
John Flam steed and Edmund Holly.
Holly would later help.

63
00:03:47,831 --> 00:03:50,170
Newton published his
Principia Mathematica.

64
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:55,930
This book stated Newton's laws of motion
and gave birth to classical mechanics.

65
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:57,850
It was published your life.
Fifth,

66
00:03:57,851 --> 00:04:02,851
1687 years earlier in 1676 Newton
wrote the hook if I have seen farther,

67
00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:10,530
it is by standing on the shoulders of
giants and 1689 and in 1701 Newton became

68
00:04:11,891 --> 00:04:15,900
a member of parliament is recorded
that he only spoke once to,

69
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:17,290
I said a window be closed.

70
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:22,600
In 1696 he became warden of the Royal
Mint where he heavily cracked down on

71
00:04:22,601 --> 00:04:23,434
counterfeiters.

72
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:27,790
Newton held this position for the last
30 years of his life prosecuting 28

73
00:04:27,791 --> 00:04:32,791
corners and 1703 Newton became president
of the royal society and 1705 Newton

74
00:04:33,941 --> 00:04:38,020
was knighted by queen and hence
the name Sir Isaac Newton. Well,

75
00:04:38,021 --> 00:04:41,680
this was likely more due to political
occurrences and scientific achievements

76
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:44,050
towards the end of his life.

77
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:48,130
Newton lived in cranberry park with his
niece and her husband until he died in

78
00:04:48,131 --> 00:04:50,680
his sleep on March 20th,

79
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:53,800
1727 he was buried in Westminster Abbey.

80
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:55,780
He died of natural causes,

81
00:04:55,781 --> 00:04:59,590
though examinations of his body after
his death revealed traces of mercury in

82
00:04:59,591 --> 00:05:01,750
his hair,
mercury poisoning.

83
00:05:01,751 --> 00:05:04,870
He may have been a part of Newton's
strange behavior and mental breakdowns in

84
00:05:04,871 --> 00:05:05,710
his later life.

85
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:10,870
The life of Isaac Newton was extremely
profound and the words of Alexander Pope,

86
00:05:10,871 --> 00:05:13,150
I remember it as a suitable
description of Newton

87
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:18,280
nature and nature's laws.
Late, hidden night, God said,

88
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:20,560
let there be Newton and all was light.
