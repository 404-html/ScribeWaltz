Hello everyone.

2
00:00:01,171 --> 00:00:06,171
As we get into the final days of 2017
I'd like to take the opportunity to

3
00:00:06,241 --> 00:00:09,570
encourage you guys to share your
comments, questions, concerns,

4
00:00:09,571 --> 00:00:14,130
suggestions and all that sort of thing.
As we look toward the new year,

5
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:19,200
a problem a lot of youtube channels have
I noticed is that they don't respond to

6
00:00:19,201 --> 00:00:22,230
their audiences and I
value your guys' input.

7
00:00:22,231 --> 00:00:26,040
I read all your comments and I take would
you guys say into consideration as a

8
00:00:26,041 --> 00:00:30,600
way to improve my channel and so I
wanted to do this and then make a video

9
00:00:30,601 --> 00:00:35,550
sometime early January responding to
what you guys have said. Two big things.

10
00:00:35,551 --> 00:00:39,360
I get, for example, one, I
talked too quickly and too,

11
00:00:39,361 --> 00:00:41,760
I sound too monotonous.
Sometimes.

12
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:45,810
Those are things which I have been trying
to improve on and I like to say that I

13
00:00:45,811 --> 00:00:50,070
think I've gotten better since the
spring and summer of this year. Secondly,

14
00:00:50,071 --> 00:00:51,540
I want to reiterate,

15
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:56,600
I do not mind if you guys
correct or criticize me
because fire of learning holds

16
00:00:56,911 --> 00:00:57,600
truthful,

17
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:02,600
factual on biased genuine information
as a top priority because I honestly

18
00:01:03,421 --> 00:01:08,400
believe that that kind of information
deserves a safe haven and this kind of

19
00:01:08,401 --> 00:01:11,100
world and I know that there are plenty
of you out there that share the same

20
00:01:11,101 --> 00:01:15,450
frustration and I would rather have
a dumb mistake called out then help

21
00:01:15,451 --> 00:01:19,080
perpetuate something that is wrong just
so that I can look like I have a giant

22
00:01:19,081 --> 00:01:19,681
perfect,

23
00:01:19,681 --> 00:01:24,681
admirable brain and I appreciate that
you guys have corrected me and I've tried

24
00:01:24,931 --> 00:01:28,620
to give you credit and the comments of
videos where I have made an error not to

25
00:01:28,621 --> 00:01:30,180
spend too much time on this point,

26
00:01:30,181 --> 00:01:34,650
but I would add that saying I'm wrong
or that my video was bad without

27
00:01:34,651 --> 00:01:38,910
explaining why just comes off as pompous
ship posting part of my French and I

28
00:01:38,911 --> 00:01:40,170
can't really do much with it.

29
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:44,940
I have more videos coming before the
end of 2017 and the coming year I have

30
00:01:44,941 --> 00:01:49,110
plans. I admit I work
spontaneously and wing a lot,

31
00:01:49,111 --> 00:01:51,870
but I do have some plans.
There was more science I want to cover,

32
00:01:51,871 --> 00:01:55,980
probably going to try to do overviews of
the histories of a couple other nations

33
00:01:55,981 --> 00:01:58,740
and peoples like I did with
the Vikings and England.

34
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,400
I know you guys like the top 10 tips
videos and I'm going to cover some new

35
00:02:02,401 --> 00:02:04,890
topics too and that's another thing too.

36
00:02:04,891 --> 00:02:09,150
I am always interested in hearing from
you guys what topics you guys want me to

37
00:02:09,151 --> 00:02:10,080
make videos on.

38
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:15,930
So I just wanted to make
a video explaining where
fire of learning is at and

39
00:02:15,931 --> 00:02:18,690
encouraged this opportunity for
you guys to give your input.

40
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:21,840
Thank you all for watching over
the past two and a half years.

41
00:02:21,841 --> 00:02:23,790
Thank you for getting fire of loading two,

42
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:26,160
almost three and a half
thousand subscribers. Now.

43
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:31,140
Welcome to all of you who are new,
be on the lookout for new content.

44
00:02:31,141 --> 00:02:33,570
I have coming out.
I have a busy schedule often,

45
00:02:33,571 --> 00:02:38,280
but I do make an effort to keep videos
coming. Happy holidays to everyone.

46
00:02:38,281 --> 00:02:41,340
Happy New Year and thank
you all again for watching.
