00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:02,100
Hello and welcome to fire of learning.

2
00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:06,270
Leonardo Da Vinci is considered one of
the greatest poly mass to have ever lived.

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:08,220
He wasn't accomplished artists,
uh,

4
00:00:08,221 --> 00:00:12,480
brilliant scientists and engineers
centuries ahead of his time and a man of

5
00:00:12,481 --> 00:00:16,230
thought he saw farther and wider
than the people of his age and his

6
00:00:16,231 --> 00:00:20,880
accomplishments and work still fascinate
us to this day and this video we're

7
00:00:20,881 --> 00:00:22,740
going to examine some pieces of advice.

8
00:00:22,741 --> 00:00:26,190
He left us throughout his life that
were central to his mindsets and his

9
00:00:26,191 --> 00:00:30,540
achievement. Number 10
iron Russ. From this use,

10
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:35,130
water loses its purity and
stagnation even so to stagnation SAP,

11
00:00:35,131 --> 00:00:39,540
the vigor of the mind. The Vinci had a
very powerful mind and like a muscle.

12
00:00:39,541 --> 00:00:44,010
He knew the importance of exercising
it constantly. Basically daily,

13
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:46,410
the Vinci was learning and creating,

14
00:00:46,411 --> 00:00:50,250
filling his notebooks with intricate
designs and studying intensely the world

15
00:00:50,251 --> 00:00:51,084
around him.

16
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:55,230
His greatest intellectual achievements
were the products of hours upon hours

17
00:00:55,231 --> 00:00:56,850
spent in study and work.

18
00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:01,230
Davinci was also quoted as saying
the noblest pleasure is the joy of

19
00:01:01,231 --> 00:01:03,180
understanding.
Number nine,

20
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:06,390
simplicity is the ultimate sophistication.

21
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:10,530
Davinci believes that the surest way to
understand something was to be able to

22
00:01:10,531 --> 00:01:14,370
explain it simply and understand all
of the basic concepts behind something.

23
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:19,410
Having a very convoluted understanding
of something confuses not only the person

24
00:01:19,411 --> 00:01:23,670
to whom you may be explaining something,
but may even confuse you at times.

25
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:26,550
Break it down to its essential oils.
Number eight,

26
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:31,020
anyone who conducts an argument by
appealing to authority is not using their

27
00:01:31,021 --> 00:01:35,100
intelligence. They are using their
memory closely related to this.

28
00:01:35,210 --> 00:01:38,250
Da Vinci was also quoted as saying,
where there is shouting.

29
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:42,690
There is no true knowledge. Davinci
questioned the legitimacy of everything.

30
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:44,490
Every power structure of the day.

31
00:01:44,491 --> 00:01:48,360
He believed it was open
to his interpretation and
in renaissance Italy there

32
00:01:48,361 --> 00:01:51,270
were plenty of authoritarian
power structures to question.

33
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:55,470
He believed that the
authority in dominance was not
sufficient for their word to

34
00:01:55,471 --> 00:01:59,730
be followed, but someone said had to
make sense logically and objectively.

35
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:04,680
Number seven poor is the pupil
who does not surpass the master.

36
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:08,760
Davinci believed that it was not
only important for a student to learn

37
00:02:08,761 --> 00:02:10,470
everything that they
could from the teacher,

38
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:14,070
but that a good student had the obligation
of taking that knowledge and going

39
00:02:14,071 --> 00:02:17,340
further with it on their own.
The Vinci was such a student.

40
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:21,030
It is said that around the age of
20 when the Vinci's teacher growth,

41
00:02:21,031 --> 00:02:23,880
you observed the work he had
done on an angel and a painting.

42
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:28,260
He has said to a put down his brush and
declared that he would never paint again.

43
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,970
Davinci had surpassed him.

44
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,770
Number six I have been impressed
with the urgency of doing.

45
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:39,840
Knowing is not enough. We must apply.
Being willing is not enough. We must do.

46
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:45,000
The Vinci was the sort of person who has
spent hours and hours and contemplation,

47
00:02:45,001 --> 00:02:46,320
exploration and design,

48
00:02:46,321 --> 00:02:50,520
but also learn very well the importance
of implementing his ideas and applying

49
00:02:50,521 --> 00:02:52,020
his knowledge in the real world.

50
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:55,560
Though his notebooks filled with
designs and theories are amazing.

51
00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:59,130
Some of the Vinci's greatest moments
we're in utilizing that knowledge.

52
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:00,393
Number five.

53
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:04,960
It had long since come to my attention
that people of accomplishment rarely sat

54
00:03:04,961 --> 00:03:08,680
back and let things happen to them.
They went out and happened to things.

55
00:03:09,070 --> 00:03:13,930
This is somewhat related to the thinking
behind Number Six da Vinci had a desire

56
00:03:13,931 --> 00:03:15,970
to be an accomplished in the and in fact,

57
00:03:15,971 --> 00:03:20,350
he did accomplish many things in life
and worked for and with many other great

58
00:03:20,351 --> 00:03:21,520
individuals of renaissance,

59
00:03:21,521 --> 00:03:24,760
Italy and fields like arc politics
and even a little bit of war.

60
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:27,280
But these opportunities
didn't just come to him.

61
00:03:27,490 --> 00:03:31,330
He went out and sought after
them vigorously. Number four,

62
00:03:31,570 --> 00:03:35,530
how many emperors and how many princess
have lived and died and no record of

63
00:03:35,531 --> 00:03:38,830
them remains yet they only
sought to gain to minions,

64
00:03:38,831 --> 00:03:41,130
enriches that their
fame may be everlasting.

65
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:44,080
Davinci want it to be
an accomplished person,

66
00:03:44,081 --> 00:03:48,370
but he was not after what he considered
to be superficial fame and material

67
00:03:48,371 --> 00:03:52,570
accomplishment. He valued
greatly achievements in
science, philosophy and art,

68
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:55,540
things that he believed would
better himself and humanity.

69
00:03:55,690 --> 00:03:59,530
It was in his contributions and these
fields that he would have a lasting effect

70
00:03:59,531 --> 00:04:02,950
on humanity and that was more important
than any fame he could acquire.

71
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:08,500
Number three, you can have no dominion
greater or less than that of yourself.

72
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:12,310
Davinci believes that the greatest
battles were waged over one's internal

73
00:04:12,311 --> 00:04:15,940
weaknesses and that the greatest
victory is where those over them.

74
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:18,100
He was not a military or political leader.

75
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:21,850
He was a very startling individual and
his life was spent on improving himself

76
00:04:21,851 --> 00:04:24,310
as much as possible.
Number two,

77
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:28,720
I have offended God and mankind because
my work did not reach the quality it

78
00:04:28,721 --> 00:04:29,554
should have.

79
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:33,920
This is not so much a piece of advice
as it is a quote which represents how to

80
00:04:33,921 --> 00:04:38,290
Vinci thought. Davinci was very hard
on himself as we said in number three.

81
00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:41,920
He was constantly seeking to better
himself and to improve on everything he

82
00:04:41,921 --> 00:04:45,790
could. Being satisfied with
yourself can lead to stagnation,

83
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:50,140
which Inda Vinci's mind is a bad thing.
His mind was always going further.

84
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:54,000
He may have been a bit too hard on
himself though and somewhat sadly.

85
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:56,290
Those were actually his last words.
However,

86
00:04:56,620 --> 00:05:00,250
don't be too sad because the
Vinci also said, number one,

87
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:03,850
as a well-spent day brings happy sleep.
So well spent.

88
00:05:03,851 --> 00:05:08,200
Life brings happy death in many aspects
we can See da Vinci was actually

89
00:05:08,201 --> 00:05:10,000
satisfied with many parts of his life.

90
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:14,440
He spoke these words in old age believing
he had done well and live life very

91
00:05:14,441 --> 00:05:18,010
well and fully. That's isn't
an inevitability for all of us,

92
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,060
but whatever death is,

93
00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:22,990
Davinci believe that it won't be quite
so bad if it has been proceeded by a rich

94
00:05:22,991 --> 00:05:24,730
and fulfilling life,
and in fact,

95
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,850
living such a life is all
we can do in the face of it.

96
00:05:28,210 --> 00:05:30,100
There is of course more
to learn from the Vinci,

97
00:05:30,101 --> 00:05:32,140
but these were just
some of his best quotes.

98
00:05:32,410 --> 00:05:34,420
Let me know what you think of
them in the comment section below.
