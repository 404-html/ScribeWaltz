Hello and welcome to fire of learning.
The big five and the Myers Briggs types.

2
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:09,480
Both seek to quantify our personalities
through analysis of our behavior

3
00:00:09,481 --> 00:00:13,200
thoughts, decision making, preferences,
perspectives, and the like.

4
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:15,660
Usually through a self report test.

5
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:21,020
The two are actually similar
in many important ways and
the Nbti you come out as

6
00:00:22,171 --> 00:00:26,310
either an I or an e introvert
or extrovert and the big five.

7
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:30,690
This of course correlates with the
extroversion scale and the NBTI.

8
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:34,980
You're either an n or an s intuitive
or sensor and the big five there's a

9
00:00:34,981 --> 00:00:38,610
correlation with this and the
openness scale in the NBTI.

10
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:42,540
You're a t or f thinker or a feeler in
the big five this is the agreeableness

11
00:00:42,541 --> 00:00:47,541
scale and Bti Jrp judge or perceiver
big five the conscientiousness scale.

12
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:50,940
Now granted these two
don't line up perfectly,

13
00:00:50,990 --> 00:00:55,140
which you can see that they are trying
to measure very similar aspects of our

14
00:00:55,141 --> 00:00:58,860
personality which are very core
to who we are and how we live.

15
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:03,960
You can pretty reasonably expect therefore
that someone who tests as an INTP

16
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:08,460
line up somewhere in these areas
on the big five and versely,

17
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:13,610
someone who scores this on the big five
probably will end up as an ist Jay on

18
00:01:13,921 --> 00:01:16,380
the NBTI.
Nevertheless,

19
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:21,410
it's no secret that the
scientific community strongly
prefers the big five over

20
00:01:21,511 --> 00:01:22,350
the NBTI.

21
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:27,690
Many people in fact completely dismiss
the Nbti as just being modernized.

22
00:01:27,691 --> 00:01:32,100
Astrology in favor of
the big five. Why? Well,

23
00:01:32,101 --> 00:01:36,360
I've argued against this in the past so
I'm not going to go too much into it in

24
00:01:36,361 --> 00:01:37,194
this video,

25
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:41,750
but I don't think that it really makes
sense to consider the NBTI modernized

26
00:01:41,751 --> 00:01:44,610
astrology and in strongly
favor the big five.

27
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:49,530
I mean they operate in a pretty similar
way and measure pretty similar things

28
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,060
granted.
Sure.

29
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:55,410
The NBTI following mad times
make it seem a little ridiculous,

30
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:59,730
but you can't always judge something
based off its fan base and yes,

31
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:03,750
there is the issue that people take
the test two separate times and get two

32
00:02:03,751 --> 00:02:04,740
different results.

33
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:09,240
Does that mean that these assessments
are a completely whimsical and invalid?

34
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:10,620
Not necessarily.

35
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:15,000
We also have to consider that sometimes
the test taker may be at fault,

36
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:19,470
that there's perhaps an issue with
getting a self aware and intellectually

37
00:02:19,471 --> 00:02:22,380
honest self assessment from
the general population,

38
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:25,500
but that's of course not the issue
with everyone, which I'll get to.

39
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:28,110
There was some problems
with both of these tests,

40
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:32,310
but there are a number of things to the
NBTI Aleks and fails to address that the

41
00:02:32,311 --> 00:02:33,540
big five does not,

42
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:37,680
which is why the scientific community
really favors it and which is what we're

43
00:02:37,681 --> 00:02:38,550
here to talk about.

44
00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:43,290
The first obvious difference is that the
big five includes a category that the

45
00:02:43,291 --> 00:02:45,600
NBTI does not neuroticism.

46
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:50,520
This has to do with the amount of time
you spend subjected to negative emotions.

47
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:55,500
Higher scores tend to feel anxiety,
fear, depression, anger, loneliness,

48
00:02:55,501 --> 00:02:59,860
that kind of stuff.
More often than lower scores in the NBTI.

49
00:02:59,861 --> 00:03:04,861
If you type Imtj that doesn't tell
someone whether you're possibly struggling

50
00:03:05,081 --> 00:03:08,590
with neuroticism, maybe mental
illness even or whether you're not,

51
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:12,010
but that's a very important part
of who you are and how you live,

52
00:03:12,011 --> 00:03:14,530
especially from the
viewpoint of a psychologist,

53
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:19,090
whether they're studying an
individual or a population. Secondly,

54
00:03:19,330 --> 00:03:23,800
there's an important difference in how
the results are presented in the big five.

55
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:28,090
Your results are placed on a
scale intended to represent
your average behavior

56
00:03:28,091 --> 00:03:30,160
and feelings with the NBTI.

57
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:33,880
I've noticed that some scales have
been implemented in some tests,

58
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:38,650
but each letter is basically a dichotomy
which to some seems like either or

59
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:39,543
black or white.

60
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:43,690
The introversion and extroversion scale
is a pretty simple example of this.

61
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:48,700
Are you an introvert or an extrovert?
For those of us in one of these areas,

62
00:03:48,701 --> 00:03:53,230
in the big five it's probably pretty
obvious, but for those in this area,

63
00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:56,710
people who exist in the range
of amber version kind of,

64
00:03:56,770 --> 00:04:01,480
it might be a little more unclear, but
the NBTI doesn't always highlight that.

65
00:04:01,570 --> 00:04:06,520
It essentially assigns you I or II and
of course the same situation happens with

66
00:04:06,521 --> 00:04:10,780
the other letters as well. The NBTI
does a good job of giving 16 types,

67
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:15,280
but it doesn't represent the variation
within each type as well as the big five

68
00:04:15,281 --> 00:04:19,420
does. And so if you're on the border
between two different types in the NBTI,

69
00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:23,710
maybe try taking the big five and see
if you land in the middle is maybe why.

70
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:28,510
Ultimately both tests can be useful tools,
depending on what you're going for.

71
00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:32,830
But from an academic standpoint,
the big five is the clear winner.

72
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,950
