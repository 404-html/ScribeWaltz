00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:01,770
Hello and welcome to fire learning.

2
00:00:01,980 --> 00:00:04,390
So at the beginning of this series we
talked about what started the Viking age.

3
00:00:04,391 --> 00:00:08,080
And after that we talked about in the
last video we talked about the Viking age

4
00:00:08,081 --> 00:00:09,060
itself. Oh, it's so far.

5
00:00:09,061 --> 00:00:13,020
We've only talked about the Vikings
as Raiders warriors and conquerors.

6
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:14,880
And if we're going to
talk about the vikings,

7
00:00:14,881 --> 00:00:18,540
we have to talk about them as
settlers and colonists as well.

8
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:21,930
The vikings very quickly
developed a mastery of navigation.

9
00:00:21,931 --> 00:00:24,540
I had really not been seen
in Europe prior to this time,

10
00:00:24,541 --> 00:00:28,470
and this led them to go on and not only
settle this and lands such as the Faroe

11
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:29,191
Islands and Iceland,

12
00:00:29,191 --> 00:00:32,430
but furthermore to go where no
European nation had gone before,

13
00:00:32,431 --> 00:00:35,130
to Greenland and into North America.
And in this video,

14
00:00:35,131 --> 00:00:37,040
we're going to talk about that.
So firstly,

15
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:42,050
the Norris arrived in and began to settle
the 18 Faroe islands located here west

16
00:00:42,151 --> 00:00:44,870
of Scandinavia, northern Scotland.
Remember, of course that didn't,

17
00:00:44,871 --> 00:00:49,871
Norris had already settled the Scottish
islands around 800 a d so not long after

18
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:53,310
the Viking age officially began,
just seven years. In fact,

19
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:57,210
the word for it comes from Freud are
the old and the worst word for sheep.

20
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:59,190
They were likely not
the first inhabitants.

21
00:00:59,191 --> 00:01:02,250
There's a good deal of evidence that
Celtic people's or perhaps other

22
00:01:02,251 --> 00:01:05,280
Scandinavians predating his era
had attempted settlement here,

23
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:09,690
but the Viking influence in colonies on
these islands is what would last at the

24
00:01:09,690 --> 00:01:09,900
modern day.

25
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:13,470
As I hinted towards a lot of evidence
indicates that a lot of these settlers

26
00:01:13,471 --> 00:01:17,570
came from the north colonies and the
British isles and such in DNA research on

27
00:01:17,571 --> 00:01:21,480
the moderate and how it ends throws a
mix of both Norris and Celtic ancestry.

28
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:25,080
Later though many Norwegians also came
to the islands for a number of reasons

29
00:01:25,081 --> 00:01:27,360
likely to escape corrupted rural at home,

30
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:31,590
they founded a number of settlements
including tore shop in which still exists

31
00:01:31,591 --> 00:01:34,050
as the capitol of the islands.
To this day,

32
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:36,480
many inhabitants here
believes that the log team,

33
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:38,490
which is a kind of Congress or problem,

34
00:01:38,491 --> 00:01:40,620
it is the oldest still
running in the world.

35
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:44,850
Large team or look ting as it
seems looks a lot like law thing,

36
00:01:44,851 --> 00:01:46,290
which is exactly what it means.

37
00:01:46,291 --> 00:01:50,030
Kind of similar to how the word republic
comes from the Latin race public,

38
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,720
meaning that public thing.

39
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:56,550
This reiterates that the vikings were
somewhat democratic around the same time

40
00:01:56,551 --> 00:02:00,210
as a settlement of the Faroe Islands
of Vikings ran into nearby Iceland.

41
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:01,860
I did a video on ice and already,

42
00:02:01,861 --> 00:02:05,250
but I think will improve here on the
scratchy audio in poor presentation skills

43
00:02:05,251 --> 00:02:06,930
of my earlier fiber learning days.

44
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:12,170
So settlement of Iceland's began around
870 [inaudible] though much like the

45
00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:12,211
Faroe Islands,

46
00:02:12,211 --> 00:02:15,730
other people specifically the Celts had
been here slightly earlier than a Norse.

47
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:16,411
However,

48
00:02:16,411 --> 00:02:20,190
Iceland at this time was for the most
part on inhabited and the Norris with

49
00:02:20,191 --> 00:02:21,930
their livestock and farming interests.

50
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:26,190
We're very interested in available land
according to the legend of Viking from

51
00:02:26,191 --> 00:02:29,790
Norway names and the daughter was
the first viking to land on Iceland.

52
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:33,690
He called the island is snail land,
land to snow later on,

53
00:02:33,691 --> 00:02:35,640
a viking name thrown off from the flow,
keep vulgar.

54
00:02:35,641 --> 00:02:38,160
Darson set up with his
crew to voyage to Iceland.

55
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,830
He brought with him three
birds from the Faroe Islands,

56
00:02:40,831 --> 00:02:44,580
one of which when released began to fly
toward Iceland and they follow it to

57
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:45,414
find the island.

58
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:48,990
They stayed for a considerable amount of
time though after having great trouble

59
00:02:48,991 --> 00:02:52,230
finding food. And after a hard
winter killed all of flunkies cattle.

60
00:02:52,231 --> 00:02:56,070
He grew angry and exhausted in called
the island Iceland out of spite.

61
00:02:56,430 --> 00:03:00,220
So it's important to note that many of
these north and and just put everything

62
00:03:00,221 --> 00:03:02,860
to ship one day and see, I'll tell
land that they knew nothing about it.

63
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:07,240
So the majority of the first settlements
in a lot of these places, not just ISS,

64
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:10,870
began only as temporary outposts.
According to Viking accounts,

65
00:03:10,871 --> 00:03:15,160
the first long term settlers were men
under angle for our nurses and eight 74

66
00:03:15,161 --> 00:03:19,000
armerson settle in a place they called
Reiki Arvik, meaning the smokey cove,

67
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:22,300
Reykjavik to this day remains
the capital city of Iceland.

68
00:03:22,730 --> 00:03:25,540
I considerable number of people
followed him perhaps during the age of

69
00:03:25,541 --> 00:03:27,370
settlement up to 20,000 people settled.

70
00:03:27,371 --> 00:03:30,370
Iceland's the age last a
little bit less than 80 years.

71
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:34,090
Iceland while being a fascinating
place is appropriately named.

72
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:36,910
It doesn't have much fertile land,
and by the early 10th century,

73
00:03:36,911 --> 00:03:39,910
the available land on the
island had been mostly occupied,

74
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:41,260
much like the Faroe Islands.

75
00:03:41,261 --> 00:03:44,080
Many settlers were from the north
colonies and the British isles.

76
00:03:44,081 --> 00:03:49,081
And in later Norwegians fleeing the
rule of King Harald Fair Norseman very

77
00:03:49,331 --> 00:03:52,330
likely discovered Greenland
northwest of Iceland,

78
00:03:52,331 --> 00:03:56,440
accidentally North's accounts state
to gum Bjorn Oates and was sailing to

79
00:03:56,441 --> 00:04:00,220
Iceland, had been blown off course
heavily by a storm. When he recovered,

80
00:04:00,221 --> 00:04:03,850
he noticed a number of islands off the
coast of what is now known as Greenland.

81
00:04:03,851 --> 00:04:07,270
And accordingly, he is credited with
discovery of it also. Accordingly,

82
00:04:07,271 --> 00:04:11,440
a number of places in Greenland to this
day are named after him in the late 10th

83
00:04:11,441 --> 00:04:15,370
century of famous Vikki, known as Eric
Thor vaults, and better known as Erik.

84
00:04:15,371 --> 00:04:18,460
The red after the color of his hair
was banished from Norway for committing

85
00:04:18,461 --> 00:04:19,300
manslaughter.

86
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:23,080
He then moved to Iceland where he was
banished again for three years for

87
00:04:23,081 --> 00:04:24,310
committing murder.
Now,

88
00:04:24,311 --> 00:04:27,340
Iceland was a little bit more peaceful
than the typical north settlement,

89
00:04:27,341 --> 00:04:30,940
but imagine being too violent for
the vikings. According to legend,

90
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:31,990
during his banishment,

91
00:04:31,991 --> 00:04:36,160
he sailed north alone to a mysterious
island about which very little was known.

92
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:39,280
He found it and explored it,
claiming many parts as his own.

93
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:40,930
After his banishment had ended,

94
00:04:40,931 --> 00:04:43,420
he returned to Iceland to
tell the locals of this place.

95
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:44,980
He called the place Greenland.

96
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:49,720
The places he discovered certainly were
habitable and indeed the climate was

97
00:04:49,730 --> 00:04:51,010
warmer than it is today.

98
00:04:51,011 --> 00:04:54,520
Greenland is probably the least
green of all the northern colonies.

99
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:58,820
Obviously this was false advertisement
directed towards the north of Iceland,

100
00:04:58,821 --> 00:05:03,550
the particularly those who had settled
pour in disagree of land in the year 985

101
00:05:03,551 --> 00:05:06,940
a great number of north set sail
for the colony on Greenland.

102
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:10,210
The Norris per usual preferred
to settle near fewer words,

103
00:05:10,211 --> 00:05:12,970
which are inlets of water
located between two clips.

104
00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:16,180
Such settlements included
[inaudible] founded by Eric,

105
00:05:16,181 --> 00:05:17,650
which meant the steep slope.

106
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:21,970
Greenland became thus medieval Europe's
far this frontier and being a part of

107
00:05:21,971 --> 00:05:22,661
North America.

108
00:05:22,661 --> 00:05:26,410
One could argue that these were the first
European settlements in North America.

109
00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:28,270
Regardless of that argument,
however,

110
00:05:28,271 --> 00:05:31,660
the north was soon make their way
to the North American mainland.

111
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:34,690
The vikings were not the first to
settle Greenland though either.

112
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:37,000
They may very well have
been the first of Europeans,

113
00:05:37,001 --> 00:05:39,730
but a number of inhabitants from
North America to called the doorstep.

114
00:05:39,731 --> 00:05:42,700
People had already been living
on the island as well. However,

115
00:05:42,701 --> 00:05:46,270
interaction between the people indigenous
to the area and the north settlers did

116
00:05:46,271 --> 00:05:49,030
not take off until the 13th century.
However,

117
00:05:49,031 --> 00:05:52,900
eventually mysteriously the Greenlanders
and the people of their homelands lost

118
00:05:52,901 --> 00:05:57,901
contact with each other much later on in
history and in 1721 Danish or Norwegian

119
00:05:57,981 --> 00:06:00,980
explorers found no European
descendants on the island.

120
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:05,300
We'll discuss what happens later on in
the series during the voyage degree in

121
00:06:05,301 --> 00:06:09,890
Linden nine 85 one of the shifts is blown
off course and as is consistent with

122
00:06:09,891 --> 00:06:12,500
Viking history being blown
off course from time to time,

123
00:06:12,501 --> 00:06:15,380
tennis a lead you to a
magnificent discovery, Vr,

124
00:06:15,381 --> 00:06:19,850
any hair you offs and reported finding
lands west of Greenland being very

125
00:06:19,851 --> 00:06:21,710
focused on returning to Greenland.

126
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:23,420
He did not go out to
explore the land from south,

127
00:06:23,421 --> 00:06:26,930
but he did tell Eric the Red
Sun Life Erickson about it.

128
00:06:27,170 --> 00:06:28,670
Life is described as a tall,

129
00:06:28,671 --> 00:06:32,000
strong and capable individual and
was a worthy heir to his father.

130
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:34,920
Life wanted his father
to lead an expedition.

131
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:37,970
The lands west of Greenland and
his father reluctantly agreed,

132
00:06:37,971 --> 00:06:40,670
but Eric was injured in preparing for it.

133
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:43,310
He fell off his horse on his
way to the ship and told life,

134
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:47,120
I am not meant to discover any
more lands besides this fun.

135
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:51,380
This was seen as an omen,
but life persisted and he
led an expedition himself.

136
00:06:51,590 --> 00:06:55,470
The vikings weren't exactly surprised at
the idea that there would be more lands

137
00:06:55,471 --> 00:06:57,500
to the west. Keep in mind, even the maps,

138
00:06:57,501 --> 00:07:00,530
they had a blends already known
to them were of poor quality.

139
00:07:00,531 --> 00:07:03,380
They certainly weren't going to have
detailed maps of what had been poorly

140
00:07:03,381 --> 00:07:04,070
explored.

141
00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:07,970
If you look at their maps and examine
how they believe the world loved at the

142
00:07:07,971 --> 00:07:10,760
time and they believe that the,
that west of the old world,

143
00:07:10,761 --> 00:07:12,410
there was a ring of lands which,

144
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:17,120
which sort of circle back around to Africa
and that they were simply discovering

145
00:07:17,121 --> 00:07:19,460
the these rings,
this ring of lands.

146
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:23,330
The discovery of North America happened
toward the ends of the Viking age.

147
00:07:23,331 --> 00:07:27,110
One events symbolizing it's near end,
was the spread of Christianity.

148
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:31,270
By this time, many vikings, including
life, had converted to Christianity.

149
00:07:31,271 --> 00:07:33,470
He'd life had been largely responsible.
In fact,

150
00:07:33,471 --> 00:07:35,150
for spreading the religion to Greenland.

151
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:38,600
He was asked by the King of Norway to
bring a priest to a settlement with him.

152
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:42,530
However, his father, Eric, did
manage to hold onto his pagan ways,

153
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:46,280
as did a number of other vikings who
felt threatened by the new religion,

154
00:07:46,490 --> 00:07:50,430
so life and his expedition set out
sailing to the lands west of Greenland.

155
00:07:50,450 --> 00:07:52,940
Soon came to a land which
he called to Lou land,

156
00:07:53,330 --> 00:07:57,260
which many people believe today is
Baffin Island and island north of Canada.

157
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,780
He found the land in
hospitable and he moved on.

158
00:08:00,170 --> 00:08:03,140
He came to a place he called
and mark land of forested area,

159
00:08:03,141 --> 00:08:06,530
which was very likely modern
Labrador trees, by the way,

160
00:08:06,531 --> 00:08:09,560
were considerable interest to the vikings
due to the short supply of them in

161
00:08:09,561 --> 00:08:13,460
places like Iceland and
especially Greenland and the
necessity of them in many

162
00:08:13,461 --> 00:08:17,780
aspects of biking ways of life must
specifically shipbuilding later on,

163
00:08:17,781 --> 00:08:20,570
Europeans would use North American
what to build their ships as well.

164
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:23,630
He continued to say all,
but he realized that winter was coming.

165
00:08:23,690 --> 00:08:26,150
Life decided to camp and a
place south of mark land,

166
00:08:26,151 --> 00:08:30,170
which he called [inaudible]
Finland according to the
sagas life claim that wild

167
00:08:30,171 --> 00:08:32,460
grapes and wheat grew all
across the land and no,

168
00:08:32,461 --> 00:08:37,250
it'll be vin Lind means wine land or
even grape land where they're really wild

169
00:08:37,251 --> 00:08:40,670
grapes here. Well, possibly there
were grapes for the down south,

170
00:08:40,671 --> 00:08:43,240
which they may have gotten a hold of,
but much like Greenland,

171
00:08:43,241 --> 00:08:46,700
it might've been a little
bit of a misleading name. In
order to attract settlers.

172
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:51,560
Think of how attractive wild wheat and
grapes sounds to destitute farmers in

173
00:08:51,561 --> 00:08:53,510
Greenland.
As I said,

174
00:08:53,511 --> 00:08:57,300
life set up base in Vineland directing
half of the expedition to stay at base

175
00:08:57,301 --> 00:08:59,010
and the other half to keep exploring.

176
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:02,700
It was somewhere during this voyage where
in the Vikings and counter people they

177
00:09:02,701 --> 00:09:05,310
called it this Grayling's
and native Americans.

178
00:09:05,530 --> 00:09:08,490
The names scrolling tells people all
about what the black in relationship with

179
00:09:08,491 --> 00:09:12,180
the natives was like. The
word means retroed ones. Well,

180
00:09:12,181 --> 00:09:14,430
first interactions may have been peaceful.

181
00:09:14,431 --> 00:09:18,150
North's accounts all tell of eventual
violence and hostile relations.

182
00:09:18,210 --> 00:09:21,450
This mixed with the fact that the
colony of Finland was dependent on

183
00:09:21,451 --> 00:09:25,560
interactions with the feeble Greenland
colony is likely why the binland colony

184
00:09:25,561 --> 00:09:26,730
eventually failed.

185
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,860
Life eventually returned to Greenland
where his father Eric soon died of a ds,

186
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:32,760
a disease affecting the entire colony.

187
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:36,180
Life subsequently became chieftain
of the call and he was kept busy with

188
00:09:36,181 --> 00:09:38,340
Greenlandic affairs for
the rest of his life.

189
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:41,640
Though his siblings and other vikings
did attempt to reestablish in North

190
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:44,310
American call need for the
aforementioned reasons it failed.

191
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,830
One of life's brothers in fact
was killed and about it. Well,

192
00:09:46,831 --> 00:09:50,340
the native Americans in the colony
was totally abandoned. However,

193
00:09:50,341 --> 00:09:51,900
it is interesting to note the Norse,

194
00:09:51,901 --> 00:09:55,740
we're still gathering wood from
Markland as late as the 14th century,

195
00:09:55,741 --> 00:09:59,550
so they had been aware of this outpost
and encountering natives for hundreds of

196
00:09:59,550 --> 00:09:59,910
years.

197
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:03,720
It's interesting to consider what would
have happened if the north colonies had

198
00:10:03,721 --> 00:10:07,080
succeeded and if they would've maintained
peaceful relations with the natives.

199
00:10:07,530 --> 00:10:08,730
Keep in mind of course,

200
00:10:08,731 --> 00:10:12,540
that their discoveries per data
Columbus's by over 400 years,

201
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:15,120
if the colony of villains
had persists to the north,

202
00:10:15,121 --> 00:10:19,350
may have not only maintain
a strong social, cultural,
ethnic, linguistic, et Cetera,

203
00:10:19,351 --> 00:10:20,820
prejudice presence in Canada,

204
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:25,180
but they in custom with north north
lifestyle could have persisted in colonize

205
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:29,820
much more of North America. Where exactly
was Finland though for a long time.

206
00:10:29,821 --> 00:10:34,200
In fact, up until only recently, it was
not really known. People had guests,

207
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:38,130
obviously it was somewhere in Canada or
perhaps even the northern United States

208
00:10:38,131 --> 00:10:41,190
due to the references of grapes
and the climate and such things,

209
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:43,620
but in the 60s to know regions,
how it go.

210
00:10:43,621 --> 00:10:47,910
And Anna instead using references from
locals who believed in nearby runes were

211
00:10:47,911 --> 00:10:52,650
native American in origin and using Viking
details from their maps and the sagas

212
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:56,680
discovered what they believed to have
been the viking colony in Los Oma.

213
00:10:56,681 --> 00:10:58,680
Doze on the tip of Newfoundland.

214
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:02,520
The architecture of the settlement is
the presence of things such as iron and

215
00:11:02,521 --> 00:11:07,470
other details or reinforced the likelihood
that this is the Vin Lynde and the

216
00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:07,860
Norse Sagas.

217
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:11,460
And from all of this we may gather very
obviously the vikings were not just

218
00:11:11,461 --> 00:11:13,350
Raiders or murderers or Congress,

219
00:11:13,351 --> 00:11:16,980
but there were also explorers and settlers
who extended far beyond the reach of

220
00:11:16,981 --> 00:11:20,040
any Europeans at the time.
Now throughout these videos,

221
00:11:20,041 --> 00:11:24,810
I kept referencing viking accounts and
the Norse Sagas and some of the next two

222
00:11:24,811 --> 00:11:25,261
videos.

223
00:11:25,261 --> 00:11:29,760
I want to read two stories from the
Viking Sagas to gain a more direct insight

224
00:11:29,761 --> 00:11:31,110
into the Viking perspective.

225
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:33,480
So to keep up with these videos
and more videos like this,

226
00:11:33,481 --> 00:11:36,870
