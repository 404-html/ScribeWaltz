2
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:20,430
Greek fire was a sort
of medieval flame store,

3
00:00:20,431 --> 00:00:25,431
which was using combat and helped the
Byzantine Empire Win many battles and

4
00:00:26,090 --> 00:00:29,580
century weapons had been using history
beforehand. Of course by the Assyrians,

5
00:00:29,581 --> 00:00:34,230
Romans, Chinese, and others hovered
Greek fire. We came about the 672 AED.

6
00:00:34,231 --> 00:00:36,540
According to Theo,
upon of Colleen and coasts,

7
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:42,060
the weapon proves very useful in Byzantium
swore that the Arabs and assassin and

8
00:00:42,061 --> 00:00:44,430
Persians were gradually
weakening the empire.

9
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:50,720
The weapon had its debut in a siege of
Constantinople and 674 and the Arabs

10
00:00:51,301 --> 00:00:52,360
under Kalief.
He has the,

11
00:00:52,361 --> 00:00:55,590
the first attempted to invade and
control the Santiam teams, Capitol City,

12
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,600
Constantinople.
However,

13
00:00:57,601 --> 00:01:00,840
Greek fire was responsible primarily
for destroying the Arab fleet,

14
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:03,630
thus securing victory after four years.

15
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:09,950
Greek fire was also used when the Arabs
came back in 700 1880 it was also,

16
00:01:10,001 --> 00:01:11,070
he was against the vikings,

17
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:14,130
Bulgarians and in the Byzantine
civil war because secure victory.

18
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:16,040
Okay.

19
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:17,840
The Arabs attempts to coffee the weapon,

20
00:01:17,841 --> 00:01:19,790
however they were
unsuccessful in doing so,

21
00:01:19,910 --> 00:01:23,360
the composition of the weapon was a
secret and remains so. To this day,

22
00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:26,510
it requires several parts
to correctly operate in.

23
00:01:26,511 --> 00:01:29,030
Different people were assigned
to operate different parts,

24
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:33,770
meaning even the sea foam. Now
Roy, the Byzantine inflame flowers,

25
00:01:33,771 --> 00:01:38,720
we're not sure if how it worked. What
historians and chemists do know though,

26
00:01:38,721 --> 00:01:41,450
is that the substance as a liquid,
it burns on water.

27
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:45,260
It produced a large amount of smoke
was not easily extinguishable.

28
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:50,720
Most historians agree that it was based
on petroleum, much like modern napalm,

29
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:51,920
a crude oil,

30
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:56,630
not as NAPFA was readily available to
the Byzantines along with resident being

31
00:01:56,631 --> 00:02:00,650
added to the mixture. Now, the truth
about the composition remains a mystery.

32
00:02:00,651 --> 00:02:02,420
It may for a very long time.

33
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:04,420
Okay?

34
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:06,670
