00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:02,010
Hello and welcome to fire of learning.

2
00:00:02,011 --> 00:00:06,240
I'm Justin and back in December I told
you guys that if you left any comments,

3
00:00:06,241 --> 00:00:09,150
questions, concerns, suggestions,
et Cetera, on a video,

4
00:00:09,151 --> 00:00:12,810
I did ask him for them that I would get
around to answering them and January or

5
00:00:12,811 --> 00:00:15,660
so and so here we are in mid January,

6
00:00:15,661 --> 00:00:20,661
looking at the rest of 2018 a few things
I want to discuss before I get to your

7
00:00:21,061 --> 00:00:23,490
actual question.
So firstly,

8
00:00:23,491 --> 00:00:27,930
two of the most common complaints I get
is that I talk too quickly and I talked

9
00:00:27,931 --> 00:00:29,040
to monotonously.

10
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:33,510
I agree that's been an issue and
I understand that this is a pain,

11
00:00:33,511 --> 00:00:36,360
especially to people who don't
speak English as a first language,

12
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:41,190
but I've made use of this criticism and
I take my narration in my videos over

13
00:00:41,191 --> 00:00:43,290
recent months has improved significantly.

14
00:00:43,291 --> 00:00:46,650
Though of course I will continue to
improve on my narration skills as the

15
00:00:46,651 --> 00:00:48,570
channel progress's.
Secondly,

16
00:00:48,571 --> 00:00:53,070
another complaint that I get is that I
have an agenda or a bias in my videos.

17
00:00:53,071 --> 00:00:56,940
I get these comments particularly on
obviously political or historical videos

18
00:00:56,941 --> 00:00:57,774
and things like that.

19
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:01,590
I really don't think that I do to
the extent that people accused me of,

20
00:01:01,591 --> 00:01:05,160
I think that's just something that anyone
on youtube we'll get accused of when

21
00:01:05,161 --> 00:01:06,990
they discuss controversial subjects.

22
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:11,760
And I think the most that assures me
that I'm not letting a bias slip into my

23
00:01:11,761 --> 00:01:14,190
videos is that I have videos for example,

24
00:01:14,191 --> 00:01:17,910
that have been called both rightwing
trash and left this nonsense.

25
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:22,500
It's not really correct to say that
I leave my opinions out of my videos.

26
00:01:22,501 --> 00:01:25,530
I will admit to a number of things,
like I might say,

27
00:01:25,531 --> 00:01:28,950
unfortunately 500 people died in
this event and someone might think

28
00:01:28,951 --> 00:01:32,910
unfortunately is that uh,
it was an opinion on the
matter will yet be caught me.

29
00:01:32,910 --> 00:01:34,350
I think death is unfortunate,

30
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:39,030
but beyond that I only really
add my personal opinions
to things when I think it

31
00:01:39,031 --> 00:01:41,430
would help a lesson.
Like I may,

32
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:46,800
like I may overtly state that I think
philosophy is as important as science.

33
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:49,770
That's a video that I did
on a complete opinion,

34
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,870
but stating my opinion opens the door.

35
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:55,530
Let's stay in the opinion and making the
argument that I made opens the door for

36
00:01:55,531 --> 00:01:58,740
a large amount of philosophical
conversations to take
place on this channel.

37
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:03,240
Furthermore, I don't subliminally
just insert my opinions into videos.

38
00:02:03,241 --> 00:02:07,260
My opinions on things when I share them
are right up front and I encourage you

39
00:02:07,261 --> 00:02:10,590
guys to disagree with me because I
think debate helps the learning process.

40
00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:11,880
Most importantly,

41
00:02:11,881 --> 00:02:15,900
I avoid sharing my opinions on them on
politics or economics or a number of

42
00:02:15,901 --> 00:02:18,150
social or religious or whatever issues.

43
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:20,100
I'm not afraid to talk about these things.

44
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:23,250
We've talked about them already
quite frequently, but when I do,

45
00:02:23,251 --> 00:02:25,650
I make an effort to
present all sides equally,

46
00:02:25,651 --> 00:02:29,160
fairly and objectively and often
even when I do share my opinion,

47
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:33,600
I do give fair consideration to
the opposite argument. Why a,

48
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:36,210
you guys aren't coming here
to consider me for Congress.

49
00:02:36,211 --> 00:02:40,140
You're here to talk about some cool stuff
slipping in my own perspective as fact

50
00:02:40,141 --> 00:02:42,900
just makes it unappealing.
You know, that being said,

51
00:02:42,901 --> 00:02:46,770
if it seems like I make a mistake or it
seems like I inserted buys or you don't

52
00:02:46,771 --> 00:02:49,020
understand something,
tell me in the comments.

53
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:52,260
If you're mad that I'm not pandering
to your specific view of things,

54
00:02:52,261 --> 00:02:54,180
that that's just too bad.
You're going to have to get over that.

55
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:57,450
That's not how I work and that's
not fair or intellectually honest.

56
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:00,220
Take it somewhere else,
but if I am doing something wrong,

57
00:03:00,221 --> 00:03:02,080
I appreciate your guys',
his corrections.

58
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:06,520
I make an effort to listen to you guys
and be bias information is all that's out

59
00:03:06,521 --> 00:03:08,860
there these days. You go to
school, maybe you read the news,

60
00:03:08,861 --> 00:03:12,010
you watch other youtube channels and
there's just an obvious amount of half

61
00:03:12,011 --> 00:03:16,210
truths and bias and flat out lies and
things like that that are intentionally

62
00:03:16,211 --> 00:03:20,740
inserted to reinforce some agenda and
not to just talk about something for its

63
00:03:20,741 --> 00:03:24,370
own sake. It's not hard to see. In
fact, it's hard to get away from,

64
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:25,450
I don't know about you,

65
00:03:25,451 --> 00:03:29,890
but it pisses me off when people can be
intellectually dishonest with a straight

66
00:03:29,891 --> 00:03:33,580
face. You can't trust anything and
I'm not saying it's all one side.

67
00:03:33,581 --> 00:03:36,820
Every side seems to do it.
Even people I agree with it seem to do it,

68
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:40,270
but I still think it's wrong.
Fire of learning is a small channel,

69
00:03:40,271 --> 00:03:44,860
but I like to think that we are unique
in an approach of meat or at least

70
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:49,960
uncommon in an approach of
me just attempting to present
information objectively

71
00:03:49,961 --> 00:03:54,460
and fairly and not trying to get in the
way of you thinking for yourself while a

72
00:03:54,461 --> 00:03:55,630
lot of other channels out there,

73
00:03:55,631 --> 00:03:59,080
even other educational channels
really don't respect that.

74
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,031
You know their presents,

75
00:04:00,031 --> 00:04:03,940
similar information that makes similar
videos but they want you to think about

76
00:04:03,941 --> 00:04:06,910
things from a certain perspective
and I think that's dumb.

77
00:04:07,210 --> 00:04:12,070
I think people who go out of their way
to watch educational youtube videos are

78
00:04:12,071 --> 00:04:15,100
smart enough to think for themselves.
Anyway,

79
00:04:15,101 --> 00:04:17,770
that was probably kind
of a long side rant,

80
00:04:17,771 --> 00:04:21,190
but I felt it was necessary
to reiterate bottom line,

81
00:04:21,191 --> 00:04:24,760
some of my opinions do come out. I think
philosophy is as important as science.

82
00:04:24,761 --> 00:04:28,690
I think colonizing Mars would be great.
I think Picard is the better captain,

83
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:32,230
but I do make an effort to make my
videos fair and objective and I think my

84
00:04:32,231 --> 00:04:33,910
opinions don't get in the way,

85
00:04:34,210 --> 00:04:36,790
or at least I hope they do not
have you thinking for yourself.

86
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:42,070
The only agenda here at fire learning as
promoting the idea that education makes

87
00:04:42,071 --> 00:04:45,760
the world go round and that understanding
the universe is one of the most

88
00:04:45,761 --> 00:04:50,170
important pursuits of life any way.
Now to your specific questions,

89
00:04:51,010 --> 00:04:53,530
Mark Benjamin,
you have three comments here.

90
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:57,520
The first explain the difference between
the schools of economics. Secondly,

91
00:04:57,550 --> 00:05:01,750
can you teach cryptocurrency and financial
slash bank history including gold and

92
00:05:01,751 --> 00:05:03,310
silver? Thirdly, would you be,

93
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:08,460
would you be having a
steam@dotcomormines.com
channel your first question?

94
00:05:08,861 --> 00:05:13,180
Yes. Economics is something
I haven't really gotten into
much beyond my political

95
00:05:13,181 --> 00:05:13,811
compass video,

96
00:05:13,811 --> 00:05:17,800
but it is something I have been meaning
to cover just because economics is so

97
00:05:17,801 --> 00:05:21,940
central to how we live our lives and
how the world works. Second, absolutely.

98
00:05:21,941 --> 00:05:25,930
I actually own some bitcoin and
silver and that sort of thing.

99
00:05:25,931 --> 00:05:29,950
I'd be glad to make some videos on those
topics and their histories. Thirdly,

100
00:05:29,951 --> 00:05:33,700
I'm not familiar with those websites.
I could look into them,

101
00:05:33,701 --> 00:05:38,410
but I have a fire of learning Facebook
and Instagram that I admittedly only semi

102
00:05:38,411 --> 00:05:42,730
keep up with, so not entirely
sure what I'll be doing with that.

103
00:05:42,730 --> 00:05:47,650
I guess Tj Johnson, thanks for
what you do. Live long and prosper.

104
00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:52,570
Thank you TJ. Live long and
prosper as well. Maria. Colin,

105
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:55,720
my life moves at a pace faster
than that of the Internet,

106
00:05:55,721 --> 00:05:59,510
so unfortunately I do not have any
useful intelligence for you at this time.

107
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:03,020
The Best I can offer you is good luck
and keep doing what you're doing.

108
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:06,070
Thank you Maria. I appreciate
that. Don't move too fast though.

109
00:06:06,071 --> 00:06:08,270
Be sure to stop and smell
the roses sometimes.

110
00:06:08,690 --> 00:06:11,240
Devonish Cytopenia I hope I'm
pronouncing that correctly.

111
00:06:11,570 --> 00:06:16,220
The first video I watched was top 10
lessons by Niccolo Machiavelli after that

112
00:06:16,221 --> 00:06:19,660
or realize that you have a video about
evolution as well and that wasn't really

113
00:06:19,661 --> 00:06:20,600
a good representation.

114
00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:24,350
I really appreciate the content you
post and the inflammation is of great

115
00:06:24,351 --> 00:06:25,460
quality and helpful.

116
00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:28,460
Now I want to talk about a few
things that I felt could be better.

117
00:06:28,670 --> 00:06:31,040
Your representations mostly
consists of pictures,

118
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,710
although it's debatable
that people might like that,

119
00:06:33,711 --> 00:06:37,400
but I felt switching to videos would
be a great improvement if you could.

120
00:06:37,401 --> 00:06:40,550
I would also suggest that you add
some background ambient music.

121
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:44,720
It goes a long way and makes me get my
eyes and mind peeled into the video.

122
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:48,290
I hope you take the
suggestions constructively.
I really liked his channel.

123
00:06:48,291 --> 00:06:52,610
I hope you keep making amazing and
informative videos like these video ideas.

124
00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:54,590
One top three or five strangers,

125
00:06:54,591 --> 00:06:59,060
planets were stars and the local group
or Milky Way Galaxy or the universe to

126
00:06:59,061 --> 00:07:02,630
you could start a series on a particular
topic like about great minds like

127
00:07:02,631 --> 00:07:05,090
Nikola Tesla,
Alan Watts and others.

128
00:07:05,450 --> 00:07:09,800
Three top 10 innovations that changed
the world for a top 10 books for

129
00:07:09,801 --> 00:07:13,790
personality development or to rethink
our lifestyle. They get a bunch.

130
00:07:13,791 --> 00:07:16,970
I appreciate that.
Regarding the pictures,

131
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:19,600
I'm not going to lie this things with
the thing with pictures of that they're

132
00:07:19,610 --> 00:07:20,450
easier to use.

133
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:25,460
I have used videos for space or history
of videos and that in a few of my videos,

134
00:07:25,850 --> 00:07:29,870
but the thing is that they are much more
protected and liked to get taken down.

135
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:35,210
I've considered making my own videos in
terms of like drawings or me speaking on

136
00:07:35,211 --> 00:07:35,900
camera,

137
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:40,280
but I'm not much of an artist and the
pictures are more interesting and helpful

138
00:07:40,281 --> 00:07:42,890
than just me and my room
for an entire 30 minutes.

139
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:44,630
If you guys would be cool with it,

140
00:07:44,631 --> 00:07:48,050
I could like get some friends together
and go out into the field and dress up as

141
00:07:48,051 --> 00:07:50,510
mongers or something from an
ex history video, make a film,

142
00:07:50,511 --> 00:07:52,670
something with my phone
camera or something like that.

143
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:57,620
Music is similar situation.
Not a lot of royalty free stuff out there.

144
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:02,360
I have used it in the past
but implementing it in a 50
minute video or something

145
00:08:02,361 --> 00:08:04,310
like that would be just difficult.

146
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:09,350
But if you guys want me to I could handle
that. I like those video ideas. The,

147
00:08:09,351 --> 00:08:14,351
I think the top 10 tips videos that I do
do a decent job on the surface level of

148
00:08:15,321 --> 00:08:17,600
exploring how some great minds thought,

149
00:08:18,170 --> 00:08:22,850
but I would be glad to do entire videos
on like very influential and profound

150
00:08:22,851 --> 00:08:25,160
people throughout history
like biography type videos.

151
00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:30,190
I did one on Isaac Newton way back in
2015 if you can handle my early narration

152
00:08:31,551 --> 00:08:33,620
skills and the awful audio quality,

153
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:36,560
but the information
itself is a decent enough.

154
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:42,320
David [inaudible] I subscribed because
I liked your history videos and it would

155
00:08:42,321 --> 00:08:44,030
be great to see more of them,

156
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:47,270
but I've enjoyed some of your
linguistics and space videos too.

157
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:51,700
I'm not as interested in your more
American stuff like politicians,

158
00:08:51,701 --> 00:08:54,140
Saint Patrick, Halloween,
US history, et Cetera,

159
00:08:54,410 --> 00:08:58,130
but I'm Australian so it's
fairly irrelevant to me. Anyway,

160
00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:00,690
thanks for all your great work.
Thank you David.

161
00:09:00,691 --> 00:09:04,380
That's a very great comment because I
was actually meaning to mention that I

162
00:09:04,381 --> 00:09:07,710
obviously am an American.
A lot of my viewers are from the USA.

163
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:11,190
A few of my videos are targeted
specifically to an American audience,

164
00:09:11,191 --> 00:09:15,210
but I do my best to keep in mind that
I am speaking to an international

165
00:09:15,211 --> 00:09:15,840
community,

166
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:19,820
so videos that appeal to Australians
and New Zealanders and Englishman and

167
00:09:19,821 --> 00:09:23,280
Canadians and such are on their
way along side the American side.

168
00:09:23,281 --> 00:09:24,114
Videos that I do,

169
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:28,080
I definitely do have more history but
it was coming and I have actually been

170
00:09:28,081 --> 00:09:31,680
thinking about doing some stuff on the
history of Australia and New Zealand and

171
00:09:31,681 --> 00:09:35,880
stuff like that because a sizable amount
of my viewers are such as herself from

172
00:09:35,881 --> 00:09:38,520
those countries.
Christian Rayez.

173
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:41,220
I know that you already
tread on the NBTI path,

174
00:09:41,221 --> 00:09:44,490
but I would really like it if you could
do actually do videos on individual

175
00:09:44,491 --> 00:09:45,324
types.

176
00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:48,600
I found her other type
videos so illuminating that
I would like to hear a more

177
00:09:48,601 --> 00:09:52,560
in depth analysis on specific NBTI
types or even type comparisons.

178
00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:56,160
Eg I NFJ versus IFP. Thank
you for that. Christian.

179
00:09:56,161 --> 00:10:00,300
I tried to highlight aspects of individual
types in the group videos that I did,

180
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:04,110
but I could definitely do some
videos on individual types as well.

181
00:10:04,530 --> 00:10:07,860
I also liked the idea of type
comparisons that could be interesting.

182
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:13,230
I did an overview of the entire NBTI
subject as a kind of introduction to

183
00:10:13,231 --> 00:10:16,890
personality psychology and journalists
since it was something that was popular

184
00:10:16,891 --> 00:10:19,890
among people and it's something that
I like and have very much locked into.

185
00:10:20,490 --> 00:10:23,760
My defense video in particular
was partially me saying, you know,

186
00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:26,910
the NBTI isn't just astrology for
people who watch Rick and Morty.

187
00:10:26,911 --> 00:10:29,790
It isn't perfect,
but it has some substance to it,

188
00:10:29,791 --> 00:10:31,710
some credibility it's worth looking at,

189
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:36,630
but it was also partially me responding
to an even bigger nonsense idea that you

190
00:10:36,631 --> 00:10:40,050
can't quantify personality.
There are people,

191
00:10:40,051 --> 00:10:44,550
and I displayed them in the video who are
tearing apart a lot of what psychology

192
00:10:44,551 --> 00:10:48,090
shows for no valid reason other
than what is, in my opinion,

193
00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:50,790
trying to avoid hurting people's feelings,

194
00:10:50,791 --> 00:10:54,290
which is not to be tolerated in science,
but anyway,

195
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:55,860
I'm not going to ramble on about that.

196
00:10:55,861 --> 00:11:00,810
I just wanted to say that the NBTI stuff
was a part of a much larger project of

197
00:11:00,811 --> 00:11:03,090
psychology that I want
to cover on this channel.

198
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:08,790
What I want to do with the NBTI from here
is to look at why people are the ways

199
00:11:08,791 --> 00:11:13,300
that they are, why we have the personality
traits we do. You know for, you know,

200
00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:16,050
your example in IFP in
and I have Jay and I,

201
00:11:16,051 --> 00:11:19,410
NFP is an introverted feeler
and inf j as an extroverted via,

202
00:11:19,411 --> 00:11:23,370
but why do those differences
exist? What is, for example,

203
00:11:23,371 --> 00:11:25,050
what we call introverted feeling?

204
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:29,220
Why do the characteristics that make up
what we define as introverted feeling

205
00:11:29,221 --> 00:11:33,390
exist? What's going on in the brain?
What personality traits are we born with?

206
00:11:33,391 --> 00:11:34,380
What do we develop?

207
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:38,430
How do these types compare to something
like the big five or other models and

208
00:11:38,431 --> 00:11:40,170
things of that nature.
But yes,

209
00:11:40,171 --> 00:11:44,010
definitely videos like the
ones who suggested here are
definitely in the future.

210
00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:46,410
Chest and Blankenship,

211
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:50,460
I'd like to see some more things over
more modern wars like world war two and

212
00:11:50,461 --> 00:11:53,710
the evolution of languages.
Modern wars in history,

213
00:11:53,711 --> 00:11:56,320
absolutely very relevant
and very important,

214
00:11:56,321 --> 00:11:58,780
especially in what we choose
to do with our futures.

215
00:11:59,230 --> 00:12:02,920
I have plans to address recent history
coming up pretty soon actually.

216
00:12:03,130 --> 00:12:04,330
Evolution of languages.

217
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:08,350
I love languages and I love the evolution
of languages and at a mall g and

218
00:12:08,351 --> 00:12:12,850
things like that. I've talked about
pieces of the history of some languages,

219
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:15,580
like particularly English
and several of my videos,

220
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:19,510
probably the most I've done analyzing
the history of English specifically is in

221
00:12:19,511 --> 00:12:22,690
my video is English the
hardest language to learn.

222
00:12:22,690 --> 00:12:27,690
But I honestly hate that video because
it's cringy and dumb and I honestly on to

223
00:12:27,971 --> 00:12:32,170
keep it up because my girlfriend and joy's
it for that reason. But other videos,

224
00:12:32,171 --> 00:12:35,080
looking at languages and things
like that are definitely coming.

225
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:39,820
Joseph Mcdevitt to know nothing of what
happened before you were born is to

226
00:12:39,821 --> 00:12:44,800
remain forever a child. Cicero, keep up
the good work. Very well said. Joseph,

227
00:12:44,801 --> 00:12:47,440
thank you.
I will try to do so Aaron,

228
00:12:47,770 --> 00:12:51,070
maybe do some more NBTI videos
to get some subscribers,

229
00:12:51,130 --> 00:12:54,460
maybe debunking some conspiracy
theories or flat earth.

230
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:57,550
I think that should bring some strange
people in Austin. Maybe not personally.

231
00:12:57,551 --> 00:13:00,280
I would like an evolution one,
a one series. Like I said,

232
00:13:00,310 --> 00:13:03,040
I'll be mentioning the NBTI
and the future for sure,

233
00:13:03,041 --> 00:13:06,070
and I'll be talking more broadly
about psychology for sure.

234
00:13:06,130 --> 00:13:08,470
If you guys want more videos
on the NBTI specifically,

235
00:13:08,471 --> 00:13:12,400
I'd be happy to make them
conspiracy theories. Well, you know,

236
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:15,490
strange people come around no matter what.

237
00:13:15,550 --> 00:13:17,470
That's just the beauty of the Internet.

238
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:22,480
People can be more vocal here than in
person and that includes strange people.

239
00:13:22,930 --> 00:13:26,710
Something like the flat earth isn't
really believed by a concerning amount of

240
00:13:26,711 --> 00:13:28,630
people,
but I still be glad to debunk it.

241
00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:32,680
Conspiracy theories like
that are interesting and
that they make you think, oh,

242
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:34,660
how can we be sure that
the earth has around?

243
00:13:34,661 --> 00:13:38,170
And you learn a little bit
from that question. That
initially seems nonsensical.

244
00:13:38,530 --> 00:13:40,900
So a video on the subject is worthwhile,

245
00:13:40,901 --> 00:13:44,260
even if it's not a serious threat
to messing with the population.

246
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:49,210
Probably more concerning conspiracy
theories are those surrounding water

247
00:13:49,211 --> 00:13:51,760
fluoridation or GMOs or things like that.

248
00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:56,980
And I do plan to address those things
regardless of the interesting people that

249
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,230
they will attract.
I mean,

250
00:13:58,231 --> 00:14:00,780
interesting people have already
been attracted to channel. There's,

251
00:14:00,850 --> 00:14:02,620
there's no going back.
Evolution.

252
00:14:02,621 --> 00:14:05,380
One O one biology is one
of my favorite subjects.

253
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:07,210
Genetics is one of my favorite subjects.

254
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:11,170
Videos like that are definitely
on the way. Frank COPCO,

255
00:14:11,230 --> 00:14:14,170
I would love to learn about the
history of Prussia. Slash Brandenburg.

256
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:18,640
I was born in Berlin and have seen
difficulty in finding history in Australia

257
00:14:18,641 --> 00:14:19,474
about this.

258
00:14:19,690 --> 00:14:23,080
It seems that the German people and
historians in that part of the world are

259
00:14:23,081 --> 00:14:26,830
still being browbeaten over World War II
and are therefore reticent to speak of

260
00:14:26,831 --> 00:14:30,220
expansionist policies.
I find especially in your histories,

261
00:14:30,221 --> 00:14:34,510
English one in particular that you are
very fair and even in your summation of

262
00:14:34,511 --> 00:14:38,260
attributing blame for World War One
and World War II and therefore eagerly

263
00:14:38,261 --> 00:14:39,760
anticipate your postings.

264
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:44,020
Thank you for a great year of learning a
day spent without learning something is

265
00:14:44,021 --> 00:14:47,260
a day wasted. Happy New
Year. Docushare and frank,

266
00:14:47,261 --> 00:14:49,960
I would very much like to
do a history on pressure.

267
00:14:50,170 --> 00:14:54,200
It's a similar situation here in the
United States where when you say German

268
00:14:54,201 --> 00:14:58,820
history people only think of world war
one and two but German history extends as

269
00:14:58,821 --> 00:15:02,420
you know of course long before that and
that history deserves to be remembered.

270
00:15:02,421 --> 00:15:07,010
So yes, definitely something coming
on that. I appreciate the compliment.

271
00:15:07,011 --> 00:15:10,700
I try my hardest to be as fair as
possible. Happy New Year to you as well.

272
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:15,240
Mr M your video is our appreciative
sir. Thank you. Thank you mister em.

273
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:20,260
I appreciate that there are more videos
on the way Gordon do more videos like

274
00:15:20,331 --> 00:15:21,500
the one on England,

275
00:15:21,530 --> 00:15:25,400
the full history of countries and
empires existing and fallen. For example,

276
00:15:25,401 --> 00:15:27,680
the Normans as I speak.

277
00:15:27,681 --> 00:15:31,880
I actually have a full history video of
a nation like the one I did with England

278
00:15:31,881 --> 00:15:35,030
and the works and I plan on making
plenty more throughout the year.

279
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:39,530
The Normans I've talked about in my
viking documentary and my England

280
00:15:39,531 --> 00:15:43,340
documentary though I've never
really focused on them individually,

281
00:15:43,341 --> 00:15:44,750
but I can definitely
do that in the future.

282
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:47,690
They're an interesting topic to cover,
but yeah,

283
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:51,470
expect to see more full history videos
coming up and expect to see one soon.

284
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:55,930
Jakey d 25 I really like your videos.
Thank you. Thank you, Jackie Dia.

285
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:59,090
I appreciate that there
are plenty more on the way.

286
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:03,860
Thank you for all those
comments, questions and
concerns and things like that.

287
00:16:03,861 --> 00:16:07,490
If you guys have thought of any more the
comments section in this video and all

288
00:16:07,491 --> 00:16:09,230
my other ones are always open.

289
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:13,130
I tried to read as many comments as I
