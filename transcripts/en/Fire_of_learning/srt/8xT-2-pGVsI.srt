1
00:00:01,320 --> 00:00:04,650
If you grew up in an English
speaking country like me,

2
00:00:04,651 --> 00:00:09,270
you probably heard multiple times by now
that English is the hardest language to

3
00:00:09,271 --> 00:00:11,280
learn.
I for one,

4
00:00:11,281 --> 00:00:14,220
believe this until I actually
looked at how other languages work,

5
00:00:14,221 --> 00:00:18,390
and so in this video now we're going to
compare English to other languages to

6
00:00:18,391 --> 00:00:23,391
see how hard it really is and see if truly
English is the hardest language ever.

7
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:28,820
Something to note though,
before we again obviously yes,

8
00:00:28,821 --> 00:00:32,430
someone from like the Netherlands will
be able to learn English much easier than

9
00:00:32,431 --> 00:00:37,220
someone from say China because something
like Dutch is much closer to English

10
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:40,830
then shiny. So we're going to look
at it from the point of view of Tom,

11
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:43,770
an alien who has never
communicated with language before.

12
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:47,430
Tom Has learned just about every human
language and existence and he's learned

13
00:00:47,431 --> 00:00:50,130
just about everything there is to know
about the world by watching every one of

14
00:00:50,131 --> 00:00:54,030
my freaking videos. So always prepared
now to make an appropriate analysis.

15
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:54,811
All right,

16
00:00:54,811 --> 00:00:59,811
so proponents for the idea that English
is truly the hardest language to learn,

17
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:03,660
come at it with English is the
hardest because of its slaying.

18
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:08,430
Okay,
no offense.

19
00:01:08,431 --> 00:01:11,640
But anyone who believes that English
is hard because of it's slang has never

20
00:01:11,641 --> 00:01:13,600
studied another language.
Well,

21
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:18,330
let's just set this straight right now
just about every language has slaying of

22
00:01:18,331 --> 00:01:22,030
some kind. Okay? So you could
retort to this with, oh,

23
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:26,280
but the British empire spread
his language all over the world,

24
00:01:26,281 --> 00:01:29,280
creating a great variation
and die electing such things.

25
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:32,340
But Britain was not the only
country with a global empire.

26
00:01:32,370 --> 00:01:36,330
The former lambs is Spain, Portugal,
France, the Arab empire, ex Cetera,

27
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:37,440
credit dialects,

28
00:01:37,441 --> 00:01:41,340
which are much more varied than something
like American versus British English.

29
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:42,481
Furthermore,

30
00:01:42,481 --> 00:01:47,370
dialects in something like Chinese can
be in comprehensible to speakers of other

31
00:01:47,371 --> 00:01:48,600
dialects in Chinese.

32
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:53,550
So this argument doesn't work because
English is definitely not the king of

33
00:01:53,551 --> 00:01:54,840
dialects and slang.

34
00:01:55,770 --> 00:02:00,690
But what about when people dessert there?
Desert and the desert,

35
00:02:00,691 --> 00:02:05,190
or when Buffalo, Buffalo,
Buffalo, Buffalo, Buffalo,
Buffalo, Buffalo, Buffalo.

36
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:08,970
Well, English can get pretty
hardcore with its homophones,

37
00:02:08,971 --> 00:02:10,120
homonyms and homographs.

38
00:02:10,290 --> 00:02:14,130
Especially when you get into things like
your in your there, they're in there,

39
00:02:14,131 --> 00:02:18,150
which many native English speakers
don't seem to fully understand if for

40
00:02:18,151 --> 00:02:21,720
whatever reason, but it's not the only
language with these types of things.

41
00:02:21,721 --> 00:02:24,840
So in comparison to other languages,
homophones,

42
00:02:24,841 --> 00:02:27,390
homonyms and homographs are
pretty much out of the question.

43
00:02:27,391 --> 00:02:30,450
Even though English can get
kind of carried away with them.

44
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:34,890
So while English isn't the only
language with these things like homonyms

45
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:40,050
spelling English words is
comparatively a nightmare. Take A,

46
00:02:40,051 --> 00:02:42,000
for example,
these words,

47
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:47,360
rough cough plow though thought through
and even lock their all pronounced

48
00:02:48,271 --> 00:02:51,870
differently yet all spelled the
same. Furthermore, it really,

49
00:02:51,871 --> 00:02:56,400
vowel sounds in English aren't set in
stone at all either vowels and diphthongs.

50
00:02:56,401 --> 00:02:59,680
Can you pronounce it very differently
depending on the individual word.

51
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:01,300
Really when you look at it,

52
00:03:01,301 --> 00:03:06,160
the only rule in spelling pronunciation
that seems to stick in English is I

53
00:03:06,161 --> 00:03:09,580
before e except after c. Ha, just kidding.

54
00:03:09,581 --> 00:03:14,560
Part of his vocabulary issue is because
English took a lot from other languages.

55
00:03:14,561 --> 00:03:16,630
I'll make another video explaining
this more in the future.

56
00:03:16,631 --> 00:03:20,070
But essentially English started out
as a dramatic language that changed

57
00:03:20,071 --> 00:03:24,130
radically when the Vikings and then the
French conquered England, for example.

58
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:27,370
Sometimes the Anglo Saxons
had their sicknesses,

59
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:31,090
the vikings had illnesses
and the French had diseases.

60
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:35,440
And as these three languages kind
of merged to become modern English,

61
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:37,510
all of these words stuck
around from each language.

62
00:03:37,511 --> 00:03:41,530
And we still have more
synonyms for these words.

63
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:42,820
And as time went on,

64
00:03:42,821 --> 00:03:47,170
English went out and borrowed hundreds
of words from scores of other languages,

65
00:03:47,171 --> 00:03:51,880
meaning English may indeed have a larger
vocabulary than many other languages.

66
00:03:52,210 --> 00:03:56,710
And other strange part of English
is not a grammar issue technically,

67
00:03:56,711 --> 00:04:01,060
but it is necessary to prevent
awkward speech adjective placement.

68
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:05,920
English speakers say a
big old towering tree,

69
00:04:05,921 --> 00:04:09,340
not add towering old big tree.

70
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:13,150
It's not grammatically incorrect
to say the ladder at all,

71
00:04:13,151 --> 00:04:18,151
but English speakers find the former
sue be less awkward and more natural.

72
00:04:18,580 --> 00:04:22,240
So there are some things that
make English hard to learn.

73
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:26,440
But what about English then is easy
compared to other languages? Well,

74
00:04:26,441 --> 00:04:30,460
like I'm not no gendered nouns,
sorry.

75
00:04:30,461 --> 00:04:35,461
It's just all the languages I've learned
have gendered nouns that don't refer to

76
00:04:35,561 --> 00:04:37,210
anything that has a biology.

77
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:42,010
What I mean to say is grammatically
speaking tables in French,

78
00:04:42,011 --> 00:04:45,250
our female fields in Latin are male.

79
00:04:45,251 --> 00:04:49,510
Windows and Irish are female
and girls and German are neuter.

80
00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:54,550
It really makes you appreciate the fact
that gender in English is essentially

81
00:04:54,551 --> 00:04:56,860
just based off biology.
Also,

82
00:04:56,861 --> 00:05:01,060
English syntax or word order
is very strict and unchanging.

83
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:06,750
This is a good thing in Latin Russian
check Greek Arabic to some degree.

84
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:08,680
For example,

85
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:13,980
they don't rely as much on word order
and instead change the endings of words

86
00:05:14,231 --> 00:05:19,231
themselves slightly or inflect the
words in order to structure sentences.

87
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:26,080
English comparatively relies almost
entirely on word order and therefore

88
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:30,220
worrying about databse objects,
adjectives, normatives,

89
00:05:30,221 --> 00:05:34,870
et cetera isn't as big of a deal
and English as other languages.

90
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:36,160
Looking more at grammar,

91
00:05:36,161 --> 00:05:40,660
English verb conjugation is basically
pretty straight forward except in the past

92
00:05:40,661 --> 00:05:44,290
and perfect tenses which can
get confusing and irregular.

93
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:47,050
Exemplary Grotzia teachers taught,

94
00:05:47,051 --> 00:05:51,400
but preachers haven't prot they
preached other than that English verb

95
00:05:51,401 --> 00:05:56,401
conjugation again is simple being uniform
except an adding an s in the third

96
00:05:57,020 --> 00:06:01,370
person singular. So here we
have it. Essentially Tom,

97
00:06:01,371 --> 00:06:06,371
the alien finds that English compared
to all other languages is certainly hard

98
00:06:06,891 --> 00:06:09,500
in terms of spelling,
pronouncing these spellings.

99
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:13,040
English has a large vocabulary
and some other aspects,

100
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:15,830
but easy and several other aspects.

101
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:19,850
Namely no gendered nouns
which have no biological sex.

102
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:24,410
The straight forward syntax and a
simple verb conjugation pattern.

103
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:28,460
Some concepts you need to English like
the fact that additives don't agree with

104
00:06:28,461 --> 00:06:33,461
their nouns and something like number can
be viewed as either difficult or easy.

105
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:38,600
Many other aspects which seem difficult
in English are similar in other

106
00:06:38,601 --> 00:06:42,590
languages have not more difficult.
So in conclusion,

107
00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:44,210
English is unique,

108
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:49,430
but most people would probably not find
it to be the hardest language to learn

109
00:06:49,730 --> 00:06:53,500
relative to all the world's languages.
In fact,

110
00:06:53,501 --> 00:06:56,810
it's not really that hard. It's just,
you know, it's just something you'd do.

111
00:06:56,811 --> 00:06:59,930
You now you say your own native language
is the hardest language to learn.

112
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:02,420
I've heard the French say it.
I've heard the Germans say,

113
00:07:02,421 --> 00:07:04,940
the Chinese say the Japanese say it.

114
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:09,050
Everybody thinks their own language is
the hardest language to learn. Well,

115
00:07:09,051 --> 00:07:12,470
that's all for this video.
