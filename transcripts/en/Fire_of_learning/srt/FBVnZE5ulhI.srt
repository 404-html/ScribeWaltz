00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:02,340
Hello and welcome to fire of learning.

2
00:00:02,670 --> 00:00:07,230
Carl Sagan was an American scientists
known for his work as a science educator,

3
00:00:07,231 --> 00:00:09,000
but he was not merely a teacher.

4
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:13,200
His vision was to get average people
interested in science and emphasize the

5
00:00:13,201 --> 00:00:17,370
importance of scientific knowledge and
understanding and all roles of life from

6
00:00:17,371 --> 00:00:20,850
politics and economics to quality
of life and general wellbeing.

7
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:25,470
His most famous works stressing this
philosophy and quit a number of books such

8
00:00:25,471 --> 00:00:28,110
as the demon haunted world
and the dragons of Eden.

9
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:31,230
And of course his famous TV series cosmos.

10
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:35,610
Carl Sagan believed that abandoning
science in the modern age could lead to

11
00:00:35,611 --> 00:00:39,570
catastrophe. So in this video we're
going to look at 10 pieces of advice.

12
00:00:39,571 --> 00:00:43,710
He left us on how to build a society,
which does not make such a mistake.

13
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:44,850
So let's get to it.

14
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:50,640
Number 10 people are not stupid.
They believe things can reasons.

15
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:53,940
The last way for skeptics that get
the attention of bright, curious,

16
00:00:53,941 --> 00:00:58,140
intelligent people is to belittle or
condescend or to show arrogance toward

17
00:00:58,141 --> 00:01:02,610
their beliefs. Oftentimes the truth tends
to come into conflict with religious,

18
00:01:02,611 --> 00:01:03,930
political,
philosophical,

19
00:01:03,931 --> 00:01:08,580
common sense notions or previously how
scientific thought of how the world works.

20
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:11,490
People are not always so ready
to give up these beliefs.

21
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:15,810
Their values and opinions are not always
as flexible as a scientist should be.

22
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:20,010
It is clear that Carl Sagan believes
wholeheartedly and embracing the truth,

23
00:01:20,011 --> 00:01:23,430
but he cautions that there was a
professional and mature way to go about

24
00:01:23,431 --> 00:01:24,780
introducing the truth.

25
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,860
Average people may disagree with something
otherwise logical simply because they

26
00:01:28,861 --> 00:01:31,050
view it as the opinion of the enemy.

27
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:35,190
Seginus argues is that relating to them
and showing respect for them and their

28
00:01:35,191 --> 00:01:38,100
beliefs while introducing it,
perhaps painful truth to them,

29
00:01:38,190 --> 00:01:41,610
we'll make it somewhat less painful and
you'll find them to be less abrasive.

30
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:44,910
Number nine,
if it can be destroyed by the truth,

31
00:01:44,911 --> 00:01:46,770
it deserves to be destroyed by the truth.

32
00:01:47,010 --> 00:01:50,940
While Carl Sagan suggests a nonaggressive
and mature approach to debate and

33
00:01:50,941 --> 00:01:51,421
discussion,

34
00:01:51,421 --> 00:01:54,180
he does not believe that the truth
should be surrendered to fit people's

35
00:01:54,181 --> 00:01:55,290
conceptions of the world.

36
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:59,850
What is true is true because it has been
shown to be true and in the realm of

37
00:01:59,851 --> 00:02:00,361
science.

38
00:02:00,361 --> 00:02:04,110
The only reasonable grounds to say that
something is not true is to prove it

39
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:08,340
otherwise. That's the end of
the story. Number eight for me,

40
00:02:08,341 --> 00:02:12,090
it is far better to grasp the universe
as it really is then to persist in

41
00:02:12,091 --> 00:02:14,850
delusion,
however satisfying and reassuring.

42
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:19,230
This is closely related to the last
quote and that Sagan is again reiterating

43
00:02:19,231 --> 00:02:21,570
that the truth is to be
held in the highest regard.

44
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:24,630
It is very unwise to hide
behind the comfortable life,

45
00:02:24,631 --> 00:02:28,680
especially in circumstances
where understanding the
truth is of great importance

46
00:02:28,681 --> 00:02:31,500
to our lives.
Typically hearing these quotes,

47
00:02:31,501 --> 00:02:35,700
we may imagine a creationist or something
advocating their usual arguments.

48
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:36,301
However,

49
00:02:36,301 --> 00:02:39,990
this way of thinking is useful for
more than just debating creationists on

50
00:02:39,991 --> 00:02:43,470
reddit. We can take this advice
to politics, to our social lives,

51
00:02:43,471 --> 00:02:45,720
to our personal perspectives of ourselves,

52
00:02:45,721 --> 00:02:50,040
to our values and beliefs and apply the
same unwavering respect for the truth as

53
00:02:50,041 --> 00:02:53,010
a means to better ourselves.
Number seven,

54
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:56,460
the absence of evidence is
not the evidence of absence.

55
00:02:56,880 --> 00:03:00,700
Science demands evidence before
something can be confirmed to exist.

56
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:04,750
While it would not be wise to be certain
of something such as the existence of

57
00:03:04,751 --> 00:03:05,350
aliens,

58
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:08,740
which I believe Carl Sagan was speaking
of with regard to this quote originally

59
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:10,180
before on your found,

60
00:03:10,210 --> 00:03:14,350
there is a good amount of reason to
believe that aliens may in fact exist if

61
00:03:14,351 --> 00:03:18,430
there is no evidence for or against
something than science has no opinion on

62
00:03:18,431 --> 00:03:20,740
whether or not something
does or does not exist,

63
00:03:20,741 --> 00:03:24,850
and the question then is worth
pursuing further. Number six,

64
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:30,160
the nuclear arms race is like two sworn
enemy standing waist deep in gasoline,

65
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,390
one with three matches,

66
00:03:31,391 --> 00:03:36,010
the other with five Carl Sagan of course
lived during the Cold War when the

67
00:03:36,011 --> 00:03:39,790
threat of nuclear war between the United
States and the Soviet Union loomed over

68
00:03:39,791 --> 00:03:40,624
the world.

69
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:45,310
Carl Sagan regarded such a thing as
nuclear war as one of the most dangerous

70
00:03:45,311 --> 00:03:50,311
consequences of avoiding science and
reason regardless of what one might think

71
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:53,050
up to two sides and their
disagreement to these disagreements.

72
00:03:53,051 --> 00:03:57,040
Being settled over a nuclear war had the
potential to reduce huge parts of the

73
00:03:57,041 --> 00:04:02,041
entire world to ruins even the victor of
such a war with suffer the consequences

74
00:04:02,201 --> 00:04:05,920
of a fractured civilization and
utterly destroyed global environment.

75
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:10,090
While Sagan completely agreed that a more
peaceful solution to the problems that

76
00:04:10,091 --> 00:04:12,010
the world powers face is ideal.

77
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:16,330
This is a perfect example of why world
powers understanding science could be

78
00:04:16,331 --> 00:04:19,660
crucial to avoiding disaster.
Number five,

79
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:23,860
science is a way of thinking much
more than it is a body of knowledge.

80
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:27,010
Many of these codes have
been suggesting this point.

81
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:32,120
Science is more than an encyclopedia
of colorful insects and violence stars.

82
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:36,340
The scientific method or more broadly
and understanding of the philosophy of

83
00:04:36,341 --> 00:04:40,810
empiricism introduces a new
way of thinking about the
world with an emphasis on,

84
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:44,950
you guessed it, what is true, factual,
correct, and things of that nature,

85
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:49,840
even if it is uncomfortable. Number
four, the cosmos is within us.

86
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:54,610
We are made of star stuff. We are
away for the universe to know itself.

87
00:04:54,730 --> 00:04:59,330
Carl Sagan also famously said, the
nitrogen and our DNA, the calcium and rts,

88
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:00,670
the iron in our blood,

89
00:05:00,671 --> 00:05:05,620
the carbon and our apple pies were made
in the interiors of collapsing stars.

90
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:10,330
One of cross sagans must
important arguments for why
we should pay attention to

91
00:05:10,331 --> 00:05:14,260
the entire universe around us and
endeavor to understand it is that we are

92
00:05:14,261 --> 00:05:17,830
inescapably a part of it and subject
to the forces that governance,

93
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:21,670
we are not separate from the universe.
We are the universe as well,

94
00:05:21,671 --> 00:05:25,660
and that perspective can change
things quite a bit. Number three,

95
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:29,800
the fact that some geniuses were laughed
at does not imply that all who are

96
00:05:29,801 --> 00:05:33,910
laughed at our geniuses, they laughed
at Columbus. They laughed at Fulton,

97
00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:36,880
they laughed at the Wright brothers,
but they also laughed at Bozo.

98
00:05:36,881 --> 00:05:41,590
The clown science is filled with tales
of great minds whose work was originally

99
00:05:41,591 --> 00:05:45,310
disrespected and disregarded even though
it turned out to be true and quite

100
00:05:45,311 --> 00:05:46,360
profound in the end.

101
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:50,980
Such stories encourage people to stand
in the face of unwarranted criticism and

102
00:05:50,981 --> 00:05:52,930
defense of the facts.
However,

103
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:57,100
a downside to this is that people may
be reluctant to catch on when their work

104
00:05:57,110 --> 00:05:59,450
is. In fact, not all that credible.

105
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:04,640
Don't jump the gun just because something
seems profound. It might be ridiculous.

106
00:06:05,450 --> 00:06:06,283
Number two,

107
00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:10,430
we live in a society exquisitely dependent
on science and technology in which

108
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:13,220
hardly anyone knows anything
about science and technology.

109
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:17,390
Consider for a moment all the
objects and forces around you,

110
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:20,750
all the tools you use and the things
you do throughout the day and how you do

111
00:06:20,751 --> 00:06:25,190
them. Many of these things
may only function and appear
in the ways that they do

112
00:06:25,191 --> 00:06:27,020
because of scientific understanding.

113
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:31,400
That took centuries to arrive to the
loss of such knowledge and a lack of

114
00:06:31,401 --> 00:06:34,640
respect for the science that brought
these things and lifestyles to us.

115
00:06:34,690 --> 00:06:38,390
It could have caused them to never have
existed in a ways have to do the loss of

116
00:06:38,391 --> 00:06:41,810
such knowledge and the lack of respect
for the science that brought these things

117
00:06:41,811 --> 00:06:41,931
in.

118
00:06:41,931 --> 00:06:45,800
Lifestyles to us could have caused them
to have never existed in a way is that

119
00:06:45,801 --> 00:06:50,420
they do consider the gravity of the
situation in the near future where things

120
00:06:50,421 --> 00:06:53,870
like robotics in genetic engineering
and things of that nature become more

121
00:06:53,871 --> 00:06:56,930
serious threats and the public
has no idea how they work.

122
00:06:57,230 --> 00:07:00,650
This is already an issue in today's world.
Number one,

123
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:04,550
look again at that dot that's here.
That's home.

124
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:08,270
That's us on it. Everyone
you love, everyone you know,

125
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:13,190
everyone you ever heard of every human
being who ever was lived out their lives.

126
00:07:13,730 --> 00:07:18,200
Carl Sagan said that astronomy was a
humbling field of the many ways we view

127
00:07:18,201 --> 00:07:20,570
ourselves and our place in
the grand scheme of things.

128
00:07:20,571 --> 00:07:23,930
One of the most profound was from the
perspective of an image taken from around

129
00:07:23,931 --> 00:07:25,040
Saturn of the earth.

130
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:29,600
The entire planet appears as
an unimportant blue blemish
in the blackness around

131
00:07:29,601 --> 00:07:33,140
it. Yet on that barely
visible blue.is as he said,

132
00:07:33,170 --> 00:07:34,610
everything that we are,

133
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,990
no human being has ever gone farther
than a Tinier moon that orbits it.

134
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:44,330
It truly puts into perspective the things
that we do for power, fame, wealth,

135
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,950
glory status,
et Cetera.

136
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:49,910
Even the greatest empires I've only
ever controlled a fraction of a dot,

137
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:52,130
which looks like it could just
be rubbed off the picture.

138
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:56,330
Everyone with an interest in astronomy,
marvels at how small we are,

139
00:07:56,331 --> 00:07:58,970
but this picture really
drives that concept home.

140
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:03,140
That's not to say that what we have on
this tiny blue.is insignificant. However,

141
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:07,970
as Carl Sagan also said, every one
of us is an a cosmic perspective.

142
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:11,030
Precious.
If a human being disagrees with you,

143
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:15,020
let him live in 100 billion galaxies,
you will not find another.

144
00:08:15,290 --> 00:08:18,020
Even though this thought is
small and seemingly fragile,

145
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:22,160
the other hundreds of thousands of dots
surrounding it may be completely barren.

146
00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:26,120
The fact that life seems so small and
fragile from this perspective is all the

147
00:08:26,121 --> 00:08:29,390
more reason to cherish and defend
it. Cross Sagan, of course,
