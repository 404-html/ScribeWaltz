1
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:17,090
[inaudible] [inaudible]

2
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:21,830
the French revolution does not only
a major event in French history,

3
00:00:21,831 --> 00:00:22,930
but world history.

4
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:27,910
It's occurrence for a democratic ideals
and reform across the entire Globe and

5
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:29,800
paved the way for the empire of Napoleon,

6
00:00:29,801 --> 00:00:32,110
which all had a profound
impact on world history.

7
00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:34,970
But what if it never happened to start?

8
00:00:34,971 --> 00:00:38,300
We must look at wine Eventide and before
we can discuss an alternate history,

9
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:39,711
of course,

10
00:00:39,711 --> 00:00:43,250
it is truly impossible to predict the
changes that would come today and tunic a

11
00:00:43,251 --> 00:00:47,420
major event from such a long time ago
as first in a world where little changes

12
00:00:47,421 --> 00:00:48,680
can have a big impact.

13
00:00:49,970 --> 00:00:53,210
But we will use history and reasoning
to come up with an appropriate scenario.

14
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:57,120
The French revolution
happened for multiple reasons,

15
00:00:57,790 --> 00:01:00,750
democratic ideals and philosophy.
We're building up in 18th century,

16
00:01:00,751 --> 00:01:02,940
Europe and France,
like barrels of gunpowder.

17
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:06,120
All it took was a spark
to change everything.

18
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:09,480
And this spark was Francis failed economy
and it's harsh winter at the time,

19
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:15,330
well, let's say King Louis the 16th was
able to turn all this around and this

20
00:01:15,331 --> 00:01:17,100
scenario,
he fixes the economy.

21
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:20,310
The peasants are friends or
less angered democratic ideals.

22
00:01:20,311 --> 00:01:23,910
And not gain as much ground
first and foremost,

23
00:01:23,911 --> 00:01:28,350
part of Louis the 16th ever to stabilize
the economy of all familiar methods and

24
00:01:28,351 --> 00:01:32,490
our own timeline deploy in reclaiming
Louisiana from Spain to sell to the United

25
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:36,750
States in order to acquire funds for
his army and our own bizarre timeline.

26
00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:41,790
Louie the 16th that's the same thing.
France maintains possession of Heidi,

27
00:01:41,791 --> 00:01:42,510
however,

28
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:47,190
maintain slavery there until there a
billion occurs face with total loss of the

29
00:01:47,191 --> 00:01:48,980
colony,
Louie the 16th the sides.

30
00:01:48,981 --> 00:01:52,710
It would be beneficial to abolish slavery
in the colonies just as England will

31
00:01:52,711 --> 00:01:57,540
do soon and early 19th century
Europe without the French revolution.

32
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,250
The continent is better with each other.

33
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:02,460
France and England are still
in constant competition.

34
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:06,540
England is still bitter with France for
assessing the American revolutionaries

35
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:11,810
and Francis bitter about their
losses in the Americas. In fact,

36
00:02:11,811 --> 00:02:15,560
all of Europe is still dissatisfied with
the seven years war and their conflicts

37
00:02:15,561 --> 00:02:20,210
which came after and our own timeline
just before the French revolution began.

38
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:22,580
Prussia and Austria,
we're squaring up for war,

39
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:25,220
so there are alliances badly weakened.

40
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:29,600
Austrian friends seeing the thread began
to reconstruct their alliance along

41
00:02:29,601 --> 00:02:32,560
with Russia, Spain in Denmark. Meanwhile,

42
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:36,470
pressure of Britain in Portugal perform
their alliance this time taking up with

43
00:02:36,471 --> 00:02:40,310
the Ottoman Empire in Sweden as
Britain threatens the United States,

44
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:42,800
France attempts to convince
the Americans to join them.

45
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:46,770
At first President Thomas Jefferson
declines wanting America through remain

46
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:47,690
isolationists.

47
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:52,050
Eventually though the United States is
forced to declare war on Britain to the

48
00:02:52,051 --> 00:02:53,130
British harassment,

49
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:57,180
encouragement of native American
raids and for various other reasons.

50
00:02:57,730 --> 00:03:02,730
Thus begins the war of Oh six Americans
facing the blunt of the British army

51
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,900
ally themselves with France,

52
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:08,260
but France alone plus the
French soon join the fight,

53
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,870
which prompts Europe to
join the fight as well.

54
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:16,350
The war of 1806 becomes international
and North America conflict explodes.

55
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:19,180
The French and Americans
fight the British everywhere,

56
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,060
but France predominantly
leads a campaign in Canada,

57
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:26,260
encouraged by the conflict that people
of Quebec rise up to aid the French

58
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:31,090
through this work came back, becomes
an independent nation. In Europe,

59
00:03:31,091 --> 00:03:32,530
the French aren't doing as well.

60
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:35,830
Pressure is generally the feeding
author with Ottoman support.

61
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:39,100
The feeding Russia was Swedish support
and stay on meeting with friends.

62
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,770
Can you let me know?
Is that of Denmark and breaks Sweden.

63
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:46,270
Russia will be free to focus on pressure
and naval battle erupts there. Denmark,

64
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:50,830
France and Denmark fighting the British
and the Swedish French are victorious.

65
00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:55,900
Sweden is invaded in forced to
surrender France, Austria and Russia.

66
00:03:55,901 --> 00:03:57,880
Java campaign and the
pressure feeding them.

67
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:01,720
Britain is eventually forced to surrender
after this 10 year conflict as well.

68
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:05,350
Over the next century,
Britain maintainance colonies in India,

69
00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:08,860
the British Canada had been badly
wounded with liberation of Quebec.

70
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:12,220
Pressure on its ally.
German state struggled to recover.

71
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:16,210
Russia and Austria divide much of the
Polish territory and former Prussian lands

72
00:04:17,210 --> 00:04:20,380
colonies develop much as I did in
our timeline in Africa and Asia.

73
00:04:20,590 --> 00:04:24,040
But in the 1860 [inaudible] a long wave
of liberalism sweeps through Europe.

74
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:27,280
Poland declares its independence
from Russia and Prussia supports it.

75
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:30,600
They are largely successful in Poland,

76
00:04:30,601 --> 00:04:34,210
becomes an independent nation as Austria
and France struggled with liberalism.

77
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:39,250
Countries like Serbia try to rise up from
Austria, but only the Serbian succeed.

78
00:04:39,251 --> 00:04:40,084
In doing so,

79
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:45,640
France nearly engaged in civil war or
a kind of French revolution chooses

80
00:04:45,641 --> 00:04:49,210
instead to become a constitutional
monarchy. And this timeline,

81
00:04:49,211 --> 00:04:50,500
communism is invented,

82
00:04:50,501 --> 00:04:53,920
though it's not as accepted in a Europe
that has barely experienced basic

83
00:04:53,921 --> 00:04:57,850
democracy in the 20th
century war breaks out,

84
00:04:58,220 --> 00:05:02,770
pressure is concerned with an ambitious
goal uniting all the Germanic lands.

85
00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:07,180
It joins forces with Poland
to companies lands, France,

86
00:05:07,181 --> 00:05:09,100
Austria and Russia join the other side.

87
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:13,270
Britain joins pressure as well
and this time they are victorious.

88
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:16,300
The Austrian Empire has hit the
hardest losing much of its land.

89
00:05:16,301 --> 00:05:20,170
It's the pressure others to Poland
and the rest breaking up into other

90
00:05:20,171 --> 00:05:24,370
independent states such as Hungary.
Frances is some of its land,

91
00:05:24,371 --> 00:05:29,110
the pressure and a nation known as
Germany comes to power in the 1930s and

92
00:05:29,111 --> 00:05:33,160
nationalism give voice to a new conflict.
World War One this time though,

93
00:05:33,161 --> 00:05:37,210
Germany seeks to conquer all of
Europe sparked by nationalism. France,

94
00:05:37,211 --> 00:05:38,830
Britain and Russia join against them.

95
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:44,110
Germany and Poland joined forces and
absorb much of the old Austrian lands.

96
00:05:45,730 --> 00:05:49,450
Russia pulls out of the war is a mess
and chaos breaks out leading to the

97
00:05:49,451 --> 00:05:52,030
formation of the Russian
republic and seeds,

98
00:05:52,031 --> 00:05:53,890
much of its lands at the NME alliance.

99
00:05:55,930 --> 00:05:59,770
Eventually though Britain and France are
victorious against the Germans and the

100
00:05:59,771 --> 00:06:03,520
Polish are nations are
reduced to smaller sides,

101
00:06:03,521 --> 00:06:05,940
as in many other nations
are formed from their ashes,

102
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:10,690
the republics and constitutional
monarchies. There conflict still occurred.

103
00:06:10,691 --> 00:06:14,360
No cold wars happened. This timeline,
the atomic bomb was invented,

104
00:06:14,361 --> 00:06:16,100
but it never actually used in combat.

105
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:21,330
The French and the British
empire continuance to 1960s
until it's social reform

106
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,400
and revolution calls for their ends.

107
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:28,370
United States remains a largely
isolation as nation expanding its own

108
00:06:28,371 --> 00:06:32,720
territories and eventually is engaged
in its separate conflict with Japan over

109
00:06:32,721 --> 00:06:33,554
the Pacific.

110
00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:38,520
This could be a map of the year 2015
in which the French revolution never

111
00:06:38,521 --> 00:06:39,354
occurred.

112
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:48,410
The world's superpowers or Britain,
France, Russia, America, and Japan.

113
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:52,190
Because the Japanese American war took
place before the invention of the atomic

114
00:06:52,191 --> 00:06:54,790
bomb.
Japan was largely defeated,

115
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:59,480
but never successfully invaded though
was colonial possessions were gradually

116
00:06:59,481 --> 00:07:04,030
lost over time. France remains a
constitutional monarchy over time.

117
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:08,690
Eventually people are given more power
in the government. Slick, modern England.

118
00:07:08,691 --> 00:07:10,940
Today,
Russia as a republic,

119
00:07:10,941 --> 00:07:13,580
Japan is one of the lowest
absolute monarchies in the world.

120
00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:15,110
America is very strongly.

121
00:07:15,111 --> 00:07:20,111
Isolation is the European Union may
occur in this timeline as well as United

122
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:21,561
Nations.
Well,

123
00:07:21,561 --> 00:07:24,830
many conflicts which were resolved in
our timeline did not truly recover by the

124
00:07:24,831 --> 00:07:26,510
year 2015 in this timeline.

125
00:07:27,010 --> 00:07:27,520
Okay.

126
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:32,020
Also, in the 1970s the Americans,
British, French, Russians,

127
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:37,050
Japanese, each land a man on the
moon as a kind of space race occurs.

128
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:40,090
This video is made possible by
the support of Kingdom of France,
