00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:04,020
In the last video we covered the history
of Germany from its earliest beginnings

2
00:00:04,021 --> 00:00:08,910
up through the late Middle Ages.
Is that video got a magnificent response.

3
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:11,220
Thank you.
While greatly for that and this video,

4
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:14,880
we are going to conclude that history
as we pick up where we left off and

5
00:00:14,881 --> 00:00:18,330
continue to modern day Germany budget.
Before we begin,

6
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:21,720
I'd like to thank Laura and
Ashley A, B, c, d, e, f, g,

7
00:00:21,721 --> 00:00:25,650
and Gabby are for being our
most recent patrion supporters.

8
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:29,350
And now without further ado,
last owns sliding start.

9
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:52,240
We left off around the year 1437 what's
the death of Emperor Sigismund who was

10
00:00:52,241 --> 00:00:55,450
succeeded by Albert the second
and then Friedrich the third,

11
00:00:55,570 --> 00:00:57,490
both of the house of Habsburg.

12
00:00:57,700 --> 00:01:02,020
The Teutonic order had been successfully
challenged by Poland and Lithuania at

13
00:01:02,021 --> 00:01:04,450
the battle of groove vault
a few decades earlier,

14
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:07,960
and the situation in the Baltic
region was now more precarious.

15
00:01:08,050 --> 00:01:13,050
The Muslim Ottoman Turks were advancing
closer to imperial territory in 1453

16
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:17,650
they would take the city of Constantinople
destroying the Byzantine Empire,

17
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:19,990
which sparked fear
throughout the German lands.

18
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:24,220
The Hoh Hanzo learns had become the
margarines of Brandenburg centering their

19
00:01:24,221 --> 00:01:26,890
power in an emerging city,
Berlin,

20
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:31,720
despite political divisions as a time,
Germany was an economic powerhouse.

21
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:36,190
It is also some time in the 15th century
that the country takes on the new name

22
00:01:36,191 --> 00:01:39,400
of the holy Roman empire
of the German nation.

23
00:01:39,550 --> 00:01:44,320
The 15th and 16th century in Germany was
a period of earth shaking change as it

24
00:01:44,321 --> 00:01:47,620
was now entering the renaissance,
a period of technological,

25
00:01:47,621 --> 00:01:50,050
philosophical and religious
changes and advances,

26
00:01:50,290 --> 00:01:52,390
which marks the end of the medieval era.

27
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:57,480
One such innovation which took place in
the city of mines in 14 and 39 was the

28
00:01:57,911 --> 00:02:02,470
invention of the printing press by
Yohanis Gutenberg, which changed forever,

29
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:06,790
how the written word and therefore ideas
and knowledge was spread across Europe.

30
00:02:07,450 --> 00:02:09,670
In 1493 maximum million.

31
00:02:09,671 --> 00:02:12,850
The first became emperor with
personal domains growing.

32
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:16,840
Many of the emperors of the age preferred
to live outside the political mess

33
00:02:16,841 --> 00:02:19,600
that was the center of the
Holy Roman Empire at the time,

34
00:02:19,690 --> 00:02:22,930
living and dying and Austria,
Bohemia and Hungary.

35
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:27,280
The lack of the presence of the emperor.
Only worse than the divides in Germany.

36
00:02:27,281 --> 00:02:27,940
At the time,

37
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:31,480
leaving the nobility within the country
without a center around which to meet

38
00:02:31,570 --> 00:02:35,470
often resulting in fuse and armed
conflicts between them with no clear

39
00:02:35,471 --> 00:02:40,150
arbitrators along with politics,
other areas of life such as religion.

40
00:02:40,210 --> 00:02:42,640
We're becoming areas
of contention as well.

41
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:46,930
Soon perhaps Christianity's biggest
divide would begin in Germany,

42
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:52,080
sparked by a monk named Martin Luther
Martine Aloo tear was born November 10th,

43
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:57,810
1483 in central Germany,

44
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:02,740
originally pressured by his father to
become a lawyer in 1505 while causing a

45
00:03:02,741 --> 00:03:03,574
fierce storm.

46
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:07,420
Luther is said to have promised God at
that he would become a monk if he were

47
00:03:07,421 --> 00:03:12,010
spared. The exact events are not known,
but Luther kept true to his promise.

48
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:16,540
Luther was an especially pious and
devoted monk fulfilling his duties

49
00:03:16,541 --> 00:03:20,230
vigorously. However, he was not
merely a simple, dutiful monk.

50
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:24,470
He viewed things in the big picture
and searched deeply for meaning within

51
00:03:24,490 --> 00:03:28,540
religion and is spiritually
challenging time. As time went on,

52
00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:31,570
he began to question certain
practices of the Catholic Church,

53
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:35,110
partly inspired by past
reformers such as yon whois.

54
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:40,060
One issue of which Luther was skeptical
was the Catholic churches selling of

55
00:03:40,061 --> 00:03:41,020
indulgences.

56
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:46,530
Purchasing an indulgence was simply a
way for an individual to reduce their or

57
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:49,480
someone else's time and purgatory.

58
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:54,840
Luther saw this as a corrupt scheme and
noticed that that key figures involved

59
00:03:54,911 --> 00:03:58,300
had financial burdens.
Pope Leo the 10th for example,

60
00:03:58,301 --> 00:04:01,480
sought funding to rebuild
St Peter's basilica in Rome.

61
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:05,710
Luther began to question the selling
of indulgences and as time went on,

62
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:09,910
even dare to directly
challenged the church on the
issue using it as an entrance

63
00:04:09,911 --> 00:04:12,040
to challenge it on other issues as well.

64
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:16,630
The tail of Luther's next move is
one of history's most famous moments.

65
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:20,050
On October 31st,

66
00:04:20,050 --> 00:04:24,040
1517 Luther nailed his disputation
on the power of indulgences,

67
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:29,070
better known as his 95 theses to the
door of the church in Wittenberg where he

68
00:04:29,381 --> 00:04:33,730
challenged the power of the Catholic
Church and boldly began what is remembered

69
00:04:33,731 --> 00:04:38,731
as the Protestant reformation history
has perhaps somewhat romanticize this

70
00:04:39,491 --> 00:04:40,324
scene.

71
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:45,420
It is uncertain whether Luther actually
nailed the 95 theses to the church door.

72
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:49,030
Furthermore, it would be somewhat
incorrect at this point of view.

73
00:04:49,031 --> 00:04:50,650
Luther as a renegade.

74
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:55,300
His intention was not yet to leave
the Catholic church only to reform it.

75
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:59,980
The 95 theses were meant to
be starting points for debate,

76
00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:02,500
not necessarily a list of demands.

77
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:07,180
They were written in Latin
and only translated into
German by other people later

78
00:05:07,181 --> 00:05:11,140
on implying Luther had no desire
yet for popular revolution.

79
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:15,640
Luther would also question more deeply
held aspects of Catholicism as well.

80
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:19,900
Eventually becoming more radical and
questioning the necessity of the Catholic

81
00:05:19,901 --> 00:05:24,700
church itself. Much of his life was then
spent in bitter dispute with the church.

82
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:30,030
By 1521 he was summoned to the
Diet of worms by now Maximillian.

83
00:05:30,251 --> 00:05:32,650
The first had been
succeeded by his grandson,

84
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:37,680
crawled at fifth who was also King of
Spain and Ruler of Lens and Burgundy and

85
00:05:37,691 --> 00:05:40,480
Italy and via Spain,
the Americas.

86
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:45,280
He would be the first European ruler to
claim to have an empire upon which the

87
00:05:45,281 --> 00:05:48,370
sun never set.
Though he did not yet speak German.

88
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:51,880
He resided over the Diet where
Luther was expected to recant.

89
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:57,070
Luther did not recant in the
face of the most powerful forces.

90
00:05:57,170 --> 00:06:01,550
The day he stood by his works and what
he believed to be the truth saying,

91
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:06,380
unless I am convinced by the testimony
of descriptors or by clear reason for I

92
00:06:06,381 --> 00:06:09,170
do not trust and either the
pope or the councils alone,

93
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:13,310
since it is well known that they have
often erred and contradicted themselves,

94
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:17,480
I am bound by the scriptures I have
quoted at my conscience is captive to the

95
00:06:17,481 --> 00:06:18,314
word of God.

96
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:23,380
I can not and will not recant anything
since it is neither safe nor right to go

97
00:06:23,451 --> 00:06:25,460
against conscience.
A month later,

98
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:29,450
Luther was declared a heretic and
his arrest was demanded. However,

99
00:06:29,451 --> 00:06:31,220
he managed to escape to Saxony,

100
00:06:31,370 --> 00:06:34,940
which was under the rule of Prince
Elector Friedrich, their visa Fredrick,

101
00:06:34,941 --> 00:06:39,941
the wise some among the upper classes
also felt that it was well timed to reform

102
00:06:39,981 --> 00:06:41,240
the church in some manner.

103
00:06:41,570 --> 00:06:44,540
As I have mentioned in many
other parts of this documentary,

104
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:49,460
the will of the emperor did
not necessarily supersede
that of the local German

105
00:06:49,461 --> 00:06:52,130
rulers and whether or not Luther's works.

106
00:06:52,130 --> 00:06:56,960
We're effectively Ben and
each area depended on how
the local rulers felt about

107
00:06:56,961 --> 00:06:57,741
them.
Carl,

108
00:06:57,741 --> 00:07:01,520
the fifth's wars with France and the
Ottomans for the more distracted him thus

109
00:07:01,521 --> 00:07:04,730
giving Luther necessary
time while in hiding,

110
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:08,630
Luther translated the Bible
into German upon completion.

111
00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:12,590
The recently invented printing press
allowed this Bible to be spread across

112
00:07:12,591 --> 00:07:15,200
Germany at a pace
greater than ever before.

113
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:20,350
The lower classes in Germany found
inspiration and Luther many did not fully

114
00:07:20,481 --> 00:07:23,000
understand the ecclesiastical arguments,

115
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:27,020
but the peasants did feel as well that
their masters had been abusing them.

116
00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:30,140
Echoing much of what Luther
had stated in his reformation,

117
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:35,260
this transformed into the German peasants'
war in 1524 where both peasants and

118
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:40,010
disadvantage and middle classmen and
nobles fought against the nobility of the

119
00:07:40,011 --> 00:07:42,590
swabbing league.
Though massive in number,

120
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:46,860
the poorly equipped and undisciplined
peasantry. We're overwhelmed by this swab.

121
00:07:46,861 --> 00:07:50,690
Ian Leaks forces more than a hundred
thousand of them were killed and it's

122
00:07:50,691 --> 00:07:54,800
conflict and they managed to achieve
little Luther from whom many of the

123
00:07:54,801 --> 00:07:59,570
peasants drew inspiration initially
condemned the revolt and even later stated

124
00:07:59,571 --> 00:08:02,540
that the peasants should
be killed like mad dogs.

125
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:07,520
In 1529 it was ordered that the Lutherans
and others separatist groups and their

126
00:08:07,521 --> 00:08:09,620
heresy at the Diet of spare.

127
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:13,880
These separatists prince's protested if
this order giving them the name of their

128
00:08:13,881 --> 00:08:16,850
branch of Christianity Protestantism,

129
00:08:17,210 --> 00:08:22,210
a unifying name for the non Catholic and
nonorthodox branches of Christianity.

130
00:08:23,090 --> 00:08:26,480
Maybe the label depends on
which Christian group you ask,

131
00:08:26,481 --> 00:08:30,680
but more on that in a future video does
the emphasis on individuals interpreting

132
00:08:30,681 --> 00:08:34,760
the Bible for themselves led to many
subdivisions of Protestantism across the

133
00:08:34,761 --> 00:08:35,594
continent,

134
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:39,950
Lutheranism and a baptism Calvinism
and many more as time passed,

135
00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:44,510
a divide between Europe would emerge
in the 16th century. By this time,

136
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:48,320
the eastern church had already split
from the west and to the Greek Orthodox

137
00:08:48,321 --> 00:08:52,850
church affecting these areas here.
Much of the north including Britain,

138
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:53,810
Scandinavia,

139
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:58,680
and northern Germany would convert to
Protestantism with the exception of most

140
00:08:58,681 --> 00:09:01,350
of Ireland.
Much of the south along with Poland,

141
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:04,770
France and southern Germany
would remain Catholic.

142
00:09:05,010 --> 00:09:08,910
Though there are today substantial
nonreligious populations in Europe and a

143
00:09:08,911 --> 00:09:11,100
quickly growing Islamic population.

144
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:16,140
This generalized religious map of 16th
century Europe is very similar to the

145
00:09:16,141 --> 00:09:16,974
current one.

146
00:09:17,070 --> 00:09:21,120
The division found in Germany is largely
ode to the division of the nation

147
00:09:21,121 --> 00:09:21,631
itself.

148
00:09:21,631 --> 00:09:25,800
In this time with the hopes for resolution
between Catholics and Protestants

149
00:09:25,801 --> 00:09:30,060
waning the Protestants to be Schmall
call Dick League to defend themselves.

150
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:32,220
By the 1514 Kaiser,

151
00:09:32,221 --> 00:09:36,810
Karl was able to turn his attention back
to the religious situation in Germany.

152
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:40,230
Tension was in now rising
many territories in Germany.

153
00:09:40,231 --> 00:09:44,240
We're now Protestant and part of the
Schmalkaldic league including sex and eat

154
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:48,570
in Brandenburg for unembarrassed
conversion included
Hohenzollern master of the

155
00:09:48,571 --> 00:09:53,571
Teutonic order outbreak breakfast first
and 1525 his territory was cut off from

156
00:09:53,941 --> 00:09:58,050
Brandenburg and the other holdings aligns
geographically and politically anti

157
00:09:58,051 --> 00:10:03,051
now styled himself Duke of Prussia
ruling the territory referred to as East

158
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:07,740
Prussia. East Prussia was not a part
of the holy Roman Empire at this time.

159
00:10:07,770 --> 00:10:12,770
It was more of a fee for Poland as Martin
Luther died in 1546 the two sides were

160
00:10:13,231 --> 00:10:14,310
preparing for war,

161
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:17,610
which would erupt into these small
call Dick wars later in July.

162
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:23,180
These conflicts would eventually come
to a close in 1555 with a piece of Alex

163
00:10:23,430 --> 00:10:25,650
Berg and an overall Protestant victory.

164
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:30,980
The main takeaway of this piece was an
agreement phrased as quiz or Ego Aus

165
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:35,010
Religio Latin for who's realm is religion.

166
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:38,130
The prince was to choose the
religion of his territory,

167
00:10:38,310 --> 00:10:43,310
either Lutheran or Catholic
and his subjects were
expected to convert or leave,

168
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:46,200
which they were freely allowed
to do without repercussion.

169
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:51,300
This was a major victory for the
nobility over the emperor is yet another

170
00:10:51,301 --> 00:10:53,340
successful challenge to his authority.

171
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:57,180
It may seem relative to
the age fair and agreeable,

172
00:10:57,540 --> 00:11:01,920
but Catholics and Protestants would not
live happily ever after tension would

173
00:11:01,921 --> 00:11:05,880
build into even greater conflicts
that would ravage Europe. Two degrees,

174
00:11:05,881 --> 00:11:10,881
never before seen following a troubled
and turbulent rural Carla fifth abdicated

175
00:11:11,461 --> 00:11:16,461
from power and 1558 dividing his extensive
Habsburg domains between multiple

176
00:11:16,621 --> 00:11:21,570
EHRs. The Holy Roman Empire going to
fare done on to the first fair to non was

177
00:11:21,571 --> 00:11:26,571
followed by Rudolph the second and 1576
Rudolph was a strange individual who

178
00:11:27,241 --> 00:11:30,930
preferred his private hobbies to the
management of his responsibilities.

179
00:11:31,110 --> 00:11:35,520
Often remaining neutral and conflict
between Protestants and Catholics and many

180
00:11:35,521 --> 00:11:38,490
of the affairs of his day in
general simply to avoid them.

181
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:42,870
The Bohemian Hussites saw
this as an opportunity to
demand greater rights and to

182
00:11:42,871 --> 00:11:46,230
recognition which Rudolph
granted in the letter of Majesty.

183
00:11:46,410 --> 00:11:51,150
During this time conflict it seemed very
realistic and the German nobility were

184
00:11:51,151 --> 00:11:52,350
busy taking sides.

185
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:57,680
Both Protestant Union and Catholic week
reformed in 1608 and o nine trouble soon

186
00:11:58,781 --> 00:12:00,880
emerged in Bohemia.
Once again,

187
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:05,890
the emperor moth lacked a male heir and
so rule was likely to fall to his cousin.

188
00:12:05,890 --> 00:12:10,890
Upon his death though the emperor was as
you know in elected and not necessarily

189
00:12:11,051 --> 00:12:15,550
hereditary position, the Habsburgs would
undoubtedly retain control over it,

190
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:20,140
resorting to essentially a bribery to
hold onto it for the next few centuries.

191
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:23,980
Matsyasana. His cousin fair to
[inaudible] was an ardent Catholic,

192
00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:29,010
which concern that the Bohemians fair to
non became king of Bohemia in 1617 when

193
00:12:29,291 --> 00:12:33,580
fair to non intended to revoke the
letter of Majesty has representatives and

194
00:12:33,581 --> 00:12:38,581
Prague were seized by Protestants and
d fenestrated meaning thrown out the

195
00:12:38,741 --> 00:12:43,090
window cause he representatives did
actually somehow survive leading to

196
00:12:43,091 --> 00:12:45,340
immediate propaganda on both sides.

197
00:12:45,730 --> 00:12:48,640
Catholics claiming that they
had been saved by angels,

198
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:53,260
Protestants that they had fallen in
manure. As revolts began in Bohemia,

199
00:12:53,290 --> 00:12:57,790
this would lead to the outbreak slowly
of what is remembered as the 30 years'

200
00:12:57,791 --> 00:13:02,791
war from 1618 to 1648 involving many of
the major powers of Europe though not

201
00:13:04,271 --> 00:13:07,330
all at once in one drawn out conflict.
In fact,

202
00:13:07,331 --> 00:13:11,620
it can be rather confusing as some has
changed sides and the other war was

203
00:13:11,621 --> 00:13:13,360
started for religious reasons.

204
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:17,530
The two sides were not split perfectly
between Protestants and Catholics.

205
00:13:17,650 --> 00:13:22,510
Matiaz died in 1618 ferritin on the
second to became emperor. Soon thereafter,

206
00:13:22,630 --> 00:13:27,630
soon Bohemia rose up leading to civil war
and the first of four phases of the 30

207
00:13:27,971 --> 00:13:28,780
years' war.

208
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:33,780
He promptly named Bohemian Phase in 1620
Protestants and Habsburgs met at the

209
00:13:34,751 --> 00:13:37,180
battle of white mountain
near Prague itself,

210
00:13:37,181 --> 00:13:39,700
resulting in a decisive Catholic victory.

211
00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:43,780
This would effectively end if the
Bohemian revolt and the Habsburgs began to

212
00:13:43,781 --> 00:13:46,480
convert the Bohemians to
Catholicism and following this,

213
00:13:46,570 --> 00:13:49,870
which is why the hussite
religion did not last to to stay.

214
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:54,370
This could have ended here
as a local revolt. However,

215
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:57,370
it had brought the concerns of
foreign powers on the table.

216
00:13:57,550 --> 00:14:02,040
The Holy Roman emperor had been acting
especially autocratic this threatened to

217
00:14:02,041 --> 00:14:05,860
the Protestants of Germany and to
Europe in general. Furthermore,

218
00:14:05,890 --> 00:14:10,510
a more powerful United holy Roman Empire
under a leader who could reverse it's

219
00:14:10,511 --> 00:14:14,740
complicated structure was a threat to
the European balance of power. Denmark,

220
00:14:14,741 --> 00:14:17,680
Norway,
a Protestant nation under King Christian,

221
00:14:17,681 --> 00:14:21,610
a fourth who is also the Duke of
Holstine within the holy Roman Empire,

222
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:26,640
intervened in 1525 by invading and
assisting Protestant rebels beginning the

223
00:14:27,521 --> 00:14:29,110
Danish phase of the war,

224
00:14:29,170 --> 00:14:33,370
the Danish were reinforced by English
and Scottish trips with French funding.

225
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:37,810
The last part is noticeably ironic
as France was a Catholic nation.

226
00:14:37,870 --> 00:14:42,640
Then led even by a cardinal
funding Protestant rebels
allied to their arch enemy

227
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:43,420
England.

228
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:47,560
The essential reason for this was that
the war was evolving to be more about

229
00:14:47,561 --> 00:14:48,820
politics and religion,

230
00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:53,480
friends with simply surrounded by
Habsburgs in Germany and Spain. The Danes,

231
00:14:53,481 --> 00:14:57,920
however, were repelled back into Denmark
by these skill to General Al [inaudible]

232
00:14:57,970 --> 00:15:02,970
Valentine Denmark surrendered in 1629
leading to another Catholic victory in

233
00:15:03,651 --> 00:15:05,210
1630 however,

234
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:09,800
Sweden intervened again with French
funding under renowned King Gustavus,

235
00:15:09,801 --> 00:15:11,360
Adolphus Sweden.

236
00:15:11,390 --> 00:15:15,650
Shared concerns of Protestant doesn't
being threatened in their own backyard and

237
00:15:15,651 --> 00:15:17,240
of growing Habsburg power.

238
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:21,580
Sweden was initially greatly successful
against the empire winning victories

239
00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:23,410
such as it brightened Feld,
volunteers,

240
00:15:23,411 --> 00:15:28,411
dine and Adolphus met at the battle of
Ledson in 1632 the Swedes would want

241
00:15:28,641 --> 00:15:32,030
again, but Adolphus would
die leading a cavalry charge.

242
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:33,860
Volun Stein accused,

243
00:15:33,890 --> 00:15:37,970
though never confirmed of treason
was assassinated the following year.

244
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:43,010
The Swedish phase of the war ended
in 1635 with the piece of Prague,

245
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:45,950
those Sweden and France
where it is satisfied.

246
00:15:46,190 --> 00:15:49,970
Sweden continue the war against the
empire and France joined in to lead the

247
00:15:49,971 --> 00:15:51,080
fight personally.

248
00:15:51,290 --> 00:15:55,820
The French phase was the longest and
most violent phase of the war during the

249
00:15:55,821 --> 00:15:58,070
French phase,
fared and on the second died,

250
00:15:58,071 --> 00:16:02,510
and was succeeded by fair to nominate
third and 1637 who viewed the war now as

251
00:16:02,511 --> 00:16:05,620
being draining and desired piece France,
Fatah,

252
00:16:05,621 --> 00:16:10,490
and against the empire and Spain for
the next decade with a mix of results in

253
00:16:10,491 --> 00:16:15,491
1648 the war would end with the infamous
piece of best Follia and this peace

254
00:16:16,341 --> 00:16:19,100
treaty, a number of important
agreements were made,

255
00:16:19,101 --> 00:16:23,270
which would shape the future of Europe,
Switzerland, and the Netherlands,

256
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:25,670
both formally a part of
the holy Roman Empire.

257
00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:30,530
They'll practically independence
for centuries became
fully independent nations.

258
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:34,980
France became the dominant continental
power and claim the border region of all

259
00:16:34,981 --> 00:16:35,780
sauce.

260
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:39,560
Many of the religious conflicts between
Protestants and Catholics were settled

261
00:16:39,590 --> 00:16:44,180
and coexistence among the main branches
was somewhat accepted in Germany,

262
00:16:44,181 --> 00:16:48,860
at least officially. While there was
no true victor of the 30 years' war,

263
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:52,220
Germany lost the most. Most
of the fighting, as I said,

264
00:16:52,221 --> 00:16:56,090
had taken place within the empire.
8 million people,

265
00:16:56,120 --> 00:17:00,800
soldiers and civilians alike died and
the fighting or an associated feminines

266
00:17:00,801 --> 00:17:04,280
and diseases.
The great majority were imperial subjects.

267
00:17:04,430 --> 00:17:07,370
Germany lost nearly a
third of its population,

268
00:17:07,371 --> 00:17:09,680
including half of its male population.

269
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:14,170
Hopes of uniting the holy Roman Empire
into what it had once been lost.

270
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:17,660
After centuries of decline
and the centralization,

271
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:21,350
this war would strike the greatest
blow to the holy Roman Empire.

272
00:17:21,530 --> 00:17:22,880
It was not destroyed,

273
00:17:22,910 --> 00:17:26,390
but the princess had gained significant
autonomy and freedom from the central

274
00:17:26,391 --> 00:17:26,990
government.

275
00:17:26,990 --> 00:17:31,070
The Habsburgs of Austria would not
successfully research power over them,

276
00:17:31,430 --> 00:17:35,060
though Austria would remain a power in
its own right and had come out of this

277
00:17:35,061 --> 00:17:38,930
war still rather powerful.
It was this holy Roman Empire,

278
00:17:38,931 --> 00:17:43,931
which a century later famous French
radical tier would remark was not holy nor

279
00:17:44,901 --> 00:17:48,710
Roman, nor an empire. As we've
seen throughout his history.

280
00:17:48,770 --> 00:17:53,550
At one point or another, it did have a
respectable claim to each of these titles.

281
00:17:53,670 --> 00:17:54,121
However,

282
00:17:54,121 --> 00:17:58,590
now it was religiously divided
and certainly not wholly
the days of ruling of a

283
00:17:58,591 --> 00:18:02,340
Rome where history and that
was very much not an empire.

284
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:05,610
More so a loose confederation of hundreds.
In fact,

285
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:10,700
thousands technically of microstates with
some larger states along with Austria,

286
00:18:11,010 --> 00:18:13,530
one state which had fared
better than the others.

287
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:17,880
Despite heavy losses and destruction from
the war. It was Brandenburg, Prussia,

288
00:18:17,970 --> 00:18:22,560
which had come out of the
war with territorial gains
under Friedrich Ville home.

289
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:23,910
The great elector.

290
00:18:24,090 --> 00:18:28,200
As time went on and the holy Roman
empire faded into a relevancy,

291
00:18:28,290 --> 00:18:32,760
Austria and Prussia would rise
to fill the void left in Germany.

292
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:41,880
Brandenburg Prussia in 1648 was
a disconnected nation ruling.

293
00:18:41,881 --> 00:18:45,240
Other disconnected lands in a map
which is classically holy Roman.

294
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:49,980
The main territory of Brandenburg was a
poor and resource lacking land and the

295
00:18:49,981 --> 00:18:52,140
military prior to this
point had been feeble.

296
00:18:52,170 --> 00:18:56,250
Much of this was now changing under Duke
Friedrich Wilhelm, the grid elector,

297
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:57,780
who was consolidating power,

298
00:18:57,810 --> 00:19:01,320
expanding his army and seeking
ways to grow the state's economy.

299
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:06,560
Even establishing a small colony in
Africa known as he brung and Burger Gold

300
00:19:06,930 --> 00:19:10,200
Coast Prussia was not the only major
state consolidating power. However,

301
00:19:10,290 --> 00:19:13,650
Bavaria and Saxony,
we're also major local players.

302
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:15,420
Austria simultaneously,

303
00:19:15,450 --> 00:19:19,650
the most powerful of all begin to center
power and its Habsburg territories

304
00:19:19,651 --> 00:19:23,010
within and also outside
of the holy Roman Empire,

305
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:27,180
these nations at the center of the
continent and therefore it's drama.

306
00:19:27,210 --> 00:19:29,610
We're not left alone to do this.
And peace.

307
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:33,900
A series of conflicts broke out and
the half century or so following the 30

308
00:19:33,901 --> 00:19:37,080
years of war and the latter
half of the 17th century,

309
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:39,570
much of the attention
of all Europe frankly,

310
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:43,020
was on the French King Louis
the 14th throughout his reign,

311
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:47,250
the Germans would be involved in the
Franco Dutch war, the nine years war,

312
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:49,290
and the war of Spanish Succession.

313
00:19:49,470 --> 00:19:53,460
Austria furthermore was still on the
boundary of the Ottoman Empire and this

314
00:19:53,461 --> 00:19:54,300
time period,
uh,

315
00:19:54,301 --> 00:19:59,301
Turks were effectively at their zenith
in 1672 the Franco Dutch war began,

316
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:03,980
which soon evolved into a continental
conflict. The empire under Leopold,

317
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:08,310
the first and Prussia for
pitted up against France
and Sweden with Brandenburg,

318
00:20:08,311 --> 00:20:12,380
Prussia and Sweden's conflict being
referred to separately as these skinny and

319
00:20:12,381 --> 00:20:15,690
more Prussia was actually
able to repel the Swedish,

320
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:18,840
which earned it a great deal
of prestige and recognition.

321
00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:21,990
In 1683 the great Turkish war again,

322
00:20:22,050 --> 00:20:26,490
and the infamous battle of Vienna soon
followed on September 12th of that year

323
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:30,210
when the Turks besieged the city,
the capital of Habsburg, Austria,

324
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:33,180
and by extension the
imperial capital as well.

325
00:20:33,450 --> 00:20:37,710
Allied forces from across the holy
Roman Empire as well as Hungarians and

326
00:20:37,711 --> 00:20:42,210
importantly Polish came to Vienna is
eight the battle ended with a victory for

327
00:20:42,211 --> 00:20:47,211
the allies and the largest cavalry charge
and history around 20,000 were killed

328
00:20:47,861 --> 00:20:49,750
or captured during the battle itself.

329
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:53,830
The Holy Roman Empire had been spared
from Turkish rule and the Austrians would

330
00:20:53,831 --> 00:20:58,831
now push into Turkish territory taking
back much of Hungary in Prussia in 1688

331
00:20:59,770 --> 00:21:02,560
Friedrich Ville helm was
succeeded by his son, Friedrich.

332
00:21:02,561 --> 00:21:07,561
The third is Duke and 1701 the war of
Spanish succession broke out with friends

333
00:21:08,141 --> 00:21:11,260
taking on the Habsburgs and
it's English and Dutch allies.

334
00:21:11,530 --> 00:21:15,580
Much of the empire sided with the
Austrian House Berg's. However,

335
00:21:15,610 --> 00:21:17,530
Bavaria seeking the curb,

336
00:21:17,531 --> 00:21:21,430
Austrian power temporarily
cited with the French pressure,

337
00:21:21,431 --> 00:21:26,431
provided the Habsburgs with troops in
exchange for a favor rather than being

338
00:21:26,561 --> 00:21:30,250
freed or to third Duke of Prussia.
He was soon to be styled.

339
00:21:30,251 --> 00:21:35,050
Friedrich the first king in the pressure
since Prussia, unlike Brandenburg,

340
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:38,950
was never a part of the empire.
Leopold did not contest this much,

341
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:43,720
though it did anger Poland as the king
of Poland who still control of the much

342
00:21:43,721 --> 00:21:48,340
of the general territory of Prussia,
still claimed the title King of Prussia,

343
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:51,340
hence the phrase king in
Prussia for Friedrich.

344
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:53,830
Despite the war favoring
the grant alliance,

345
00:21:53,831 --> 00:21:58,831
the war of Spanish succession ended more
or less in a draw in 1714 as England

346
00:21:59,651 --> 00:22:04,330
and the other allies backed out when the
war over succession to Spain's thrown

347
00:22:04,331 --> 00:22:08,950
began. Emperor Leopold intended
his son Carl, to be King of Spain.

348
00:22:09,190 --> 00:22:14,190
Leopold died in 1705 and his son
and heir Yosef died in 1711 thus,

349
00:22:14,801 --> 00:22:19,570
the imperial throne went to that Carl
becoming Carl to sixth as he would have

350
00:22:19,571 --> 00:22:24,520
been both kings of Spain and the empire,
a threatening prospect. Louise candidate,

351
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:25,780
his grandson,
Phillipe,

352
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:29,800
became king of Spain but had to
renounce his claim to the French throne.

353
00:22:30,130 --> 00:22:32,680
Meanwhile,
and Prussia King Fredrick Ville home,

354
00:22:32,681 --> 00:22:36,970
the first had succeeded his father
and 1713 Friedrich Ville helm.

355
00:22:36,971 --> 00:22:40,930
The first would come to be known as the
sole dot and Cuny. The soldier came.

356
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:44,950
He would continue and expand on the
work of his predecessor is in growing

357
00:22:44,951 --> 00:22:47,890
pressures. Military,
despite its small size,

358
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:51,880
Brandenburg Prussia was slowly becoming
one of the most powerful states in

359
00:22:51,881 --> 00:22:54,610
Europe because of this
emphasis on the military.

360
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:58,900
The Sparta of the North Friedrich Ville
home would devote much of his finances

361
00:22:58,901 --> 00:23:00,520
and attention to the military,

362
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:04,300
even selling off the colony in
Africa to the Dutch and Benning,

363
00:23:04,301 --> 00:23:07,180
a number of luxuries and
recreational activities.

364
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:10,660
He himself lived a very
disciplined and frugal life.

365
00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:13,120
Despite the power he would come to wield,

366
00:23:13,210 --> 00:23:15,640
the soldier king would
not act aggressively,

367
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:18,700
only defensively going
to war only if necessary.

368
00:23:19,110 --> 00:23:21,610
Fresher was quite simply vulnerable,

369
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:25,610
surrounded by larger powers and
his job was to prudently defendant.

370
00:23:25,990 --> 00:23:27,760
Unfortunately in his eyes,

371
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:32,110
one of his biggest disappointments
and concerns was his own son and heir.

372
00:23:32,230 --> 00:23:36,640
Friedrich Friedrich lack the interest
in the military and state craft,

373
00:23:36,641 --> 00:23:38,830
which is father's so greatly emphasized,

374
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:42,070
being much more interested
in the arts and learning.

375
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:46,700
Fridich was accordingly,
often humiliated and abused by his father.

376
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:52,060
At one point in his life and 1730 he
and a counterpart Han's Herrmann von

377
00:23:53,270 --> 00:23:55,160
Encarta attempted to
flee to England butts.

378
00:23:55,170 --> 00:23:59,370
They were captured and von Cata was
executed for treason with Friedrich and

379
00:23:59,371 --> 00:24:04,371
being forced to watch and may of 1740
Friedrich [inaudible] died and his son

380
00:24:04,941 --> 00:24:09,590
Frederick the second became king and
Prussia. Despite his father's concerns,

381
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:11,720
Friedrich would not end up a failure.

382
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:16,040
Rather his skill as a leader would
earn him. The title Friedrich there.

383
00:24:16,041 --> 00:24:19,940
Grossa Frederick the great
as Friedrichs rain began,

384
00:24:19,941 --> 00:24:22,880
another monarchs was ending.
Holy Roman Emperor Carl.

385
00:24:22,881 --> 00:24:27,350
The six was dying without a male heir
and had previously in his reign tried to

386
00:24:27,351 --> 00:24:31,520
ensure the rule of his daughter over
all the Habsburg domains, left unbroken.

387
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:36,880
His daughter Maria Theresa would become
arch duchess of Austria in 1740 but as a

388
00:24:37,731 --> 00:24:42,230
male position her husband frons the
first would be holy Roman emperor.

389
00:24:42,530 --> 00:24:46,550
Nevertheless, Maria Theresa held
the true power of the empire,

390
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:51,860
yet it was contested and would
lead to war France, Spain, Bavaria,

391
00:24:51,861 --> 00:24:56,600
Saxony and other German and a non German
powers would oppose the Austrians and

392
00:24:56,601 --> 00:24:59,960
they're British,
Russian and Dutch and hen Avarian allies,

393
00:24:59,990 --> 00:25:01,660
but above all the arch duchess,

394
00:25:01,661 --> 00:25:06,661
his arch enemy was to be Friedrich and
Prussia and December of 1740 as winter

395
00:25:06,771 --> 00:25:11,450
was setting in Friedrich to the Austrian
surprise would make the first move by

396
00:25:11,451 --> 00:25:15,380
invading Silesia to the south and fixing
one of the richest provinces and the

397
00:25:15,381 --> 00:25:15,981
Habsburgs,

398
00:25:15,981 --> 00:25:20,720
the main and the winning important battles
such as Malevich and Hogan freed bear

399
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:24,710
in 1745 and a peace treaty
between Austria and Prussia.

400
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:29,270
This conquest was recognized by the
Austrians, a major blow to them.

401
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:33,410
Yet in 1748 when the whole
Austrian wharfs et session ended,

402
00:25:33,590 --> 00:25:38,590
Maria Theresa emerged with
her reign having been secured
and recognized at a sys

403
00:25:38,991 --> 00:25:42,590
of victory for Prussia,
a mix of results for the Kaiser reading.

404
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:46,910
This would not be the end of the rivalry
between Austria and Prussia and the

405
00:25:46,911 --> 00:25:50,600
rains of both Friedrich and Maria Theresa.
We're only just beginning.

406
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:56,800
There was for now a brief period of
peace during which freedom is free to

407
00:25:56,841 --> 00:26:00,320
explore his other refined
interests and speak with guests.

408
00:26:00,590 --> 00:26:02,420
One of whom was the French writer,

409
00:26:02,421 --> 00:26:06,110
Voltaire from Whom Friedrich was
further educated in philosophy,

410
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:10,580
full tear would say of his kingdom
that while some states have an army,

411
00:26:10,670 --> 00:26:15,670
the Prussian army has a state and with
say of his palace that it was Sparta in

412
00:26:15,941 --> 00:26:18,290
the morning but Athens in the afternoon.

413
00:26:19,130 --> 00:26:23,300
Usually I have to think of these witty
statements but Voltaire did it for me so

414
00:26:23,301 --> 00:26:27,920
thanks Voltaire in 1754 the
seven years war of again,

415
00:26:27,950 --> 00:26:30,260
which would last for nine years.

416
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:34,610
The conflict originally had begun in
the Americas where it is better known as

417
00:26:34,611 --> 00:26:36,230
the French and Indian war.

418
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:39,170
The much of the rest of Europe would
only be involved for seven years.

419
00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:44,010
Hence the name confusion. The conflict
was very much the world war of its age.

420
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:48,450
Being one of the first major
intercontinental conflicts
waged from the Americas

421
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:49,290
to India,

422
00:26:49,290 --> 00:26:53,420
Prussia and Austria would play major
roles in this conflict as they switched

423
00:26:53,430 --> 00:26:58,040
allies from the prior war with France
and now supporting Austria and Joris is

424
00:26:58,041 --> 00:27:01,200
second king of Britain aligning
himself with Friedrich,

425
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:04,980
his nephew surrounded and
knowing Austria had its ion.

426
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:10,020
So Louisiana Friedrich moved
first invading Saxony in
1756 he would then invade

427
00:27:10,561 --> 00:27:15,060
Bohemia but was repelled the Austrians
and French then moved into slightly Zia,

428
00:27:15,090 --> 00:27:19,020
but Friedrich repelled them despite being
heavily outnumbered at the battle of

429
00:27:19,021 --> 00:27:23,430
Rossbach and the battle of lighten each
of them highlighting his genius as a

430
00:27:23,431 --> 00:27:24,120
commander,

431
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:28,980
Frederick found only mild relief and
these victories he was facing an alliance

432
00:27:28,981 --> 00:27:30,360
of Austria,
France,

433
00:27:30,361 --> 00:27:34,770
Russia and Sweden with only some German
states and Britain as its allies.

434
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:38,400
Pressure had to fight tooth and nail
and Friedrichs mental health suffered

435
00:27:38,401 --> 00:27:39,234
considerably.

436
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:42,540
Friedrich likely suffered from mental
illness throughout much of his life.

437
00:27:42,780 --> 00:27:46,080
He wrote occasionally of suicide
and carried poison around with them.

438
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:48,720
At one point.
He did nearly die in battle,

439
00:27:48,810 --> 00:27:53,810
though his life was spared as his snuffbox
deflected a bullet as pressure verge

440
00:27:54,121 --> 00:27:55,020
towards the feet.

441
00:27:55,140 --> 00:28:00,140
In 1762 queen eulas a of Russia died
and was succeeded by Peter to third.

442
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:06,060
Peter was German and origin
and was somewhat of a fan
of Prussia and Friedrich.

443
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:10,320
He soon switched sides and began
attacking Austria. Furthermore,

444
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:14,250
France was seeing to feed to Britain
across the world and was withdrawing from

445
00:28:14,251 --> 00:28:15,300
the Prussian focus.

446
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:20,220
It was the miracle of the
House of Brandenburg and
led to pressure the four to

447
00:28:20,230 --> 00:28:24,360
stalemate with Austria giving up
Saxony, but retaining. So Louisiana,

448
00:28:24,930 --> 00:28:29,930
the war ended in 1763 pressures and
Australia's borders remained essentially

449
00:28:30,391 --> 00:28:32,730
similar.
A great victory for Friedrich,

450
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:34,740
though a disappointment
for the Kaiser Marine.

451
00:28:35,070 --> 00:28:39,270
In 1772 the next move was
made this time in Poland.

452
00:28:39,870 --> 00:28:44,330
Poland was in a state of
decline and Friedrich saw an
opportunity to unite is to

453
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:48,390
territories. That year. He
arranged with Austria and Russia,

454
00:28:48,391 --> 00:28:51,330
the partition of Poland,
where pieces of Poland,

455
00:28:51,331 --> 00:28:55,860
where each taken by the three powers
Friedrich who hated the Polish,

456
00:28:55,890 --> 00:28:58,350
justified this as a civilizing mission.

457
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:04,160
Now controlling all of Prussia Frederick
styled himself king of Prussia rather

458
00:29:04,261 --> 00:29:09,261
than merely in in 1765 Maria Theresa's
husband had died and their son Yosef the

459
00:29:09,901 --> 00:29:12,060
second to begin joint
rule with his mother.

460
00:29:12,180 --> 00:29:16,110
She was devastated by her husband's death
and remained in mourning for the rest

461
00:29:16,111 --> 00:29:20,970
of her life. She died 15 years
later in 1780 upon her death,

462
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:25,620
Friedrich more Inter passing and wrote
that he was her opponent but to never her

463
00:29:25,621 --> 00:29:30,600
enemy and the past.
He did call her the arch whore of Austria,

464
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:32,940
but whatever. We'll go
with it. Free to come.

465
00:29:32,941 --> 00:29:37,170
Self died in his arm chair on August 17th,

466
00:29:37,170 --> 00:29:39,990
1786 building on the
work of his predecessors,

467
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:44,650
he had turned Prussia a military power
which could rival any other power on the

468
00:29:44,651 --> 00:29:48,310
continent and has set the stage
for the future of Germany itself.

469
00:29:48,670 --> 00:29:50,920
Though there was still yet change to come.

470
00:29:50,950 --> 00:29:55,180
The rivalry between pressure and Austria
was certainly not over and the fate of

471
00:29:55,181 --> 00:29:58,450
the German people lay in the
hands of these two empires.

472
00:29:58,750 --> 00:30:03,310
Frederick had never envisioned a United
Germany truth be told he was more

473
00:30:03,311 --> 00:30:05,320
similar to the other princes of the day.

474
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:07,600
I'll be a much more
ambitious and efficient,

475
00:30:07,750 --> 00:30:11,170
but the train of events that would
create one had been set in motion.

476
00:30:13,660 --> 00:30:18,310
The German language spoken today by a
little under a hundred million people is

477
00:30:18,311 --> 00:30:21,670
the official language of Germany,
Austria and leaf inch dine,

478
00:30:21,940 --> 00:30:23,860
one of the official languages of Belgium,

479
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:28,270
Luxembourg and Switzerland and a regional
or minority language in other parts of

480
00:30:28,271 --> 00:30:30,730
Europe,
South America and even Africa.

481
00:30:31,060 --> 00:30:35,830
Its roots lie in ancient times and that
gradually expanded and diversified over

482
00:30:35,831 --> 00:30:40,090
the centuries creating many dialects
which was sometimes almost unintelligible

483
00:30:40,091 --> 00:30:44,560
and two other Germans sitting alongside
other languages in the empire like check

484
00:30:44,590 --> 00:30:48,160
Dutch and Italian.
This continued until the renaissance era,

485
00:30:48,250 --> 00:30:51,910
a time when many nations we're seeking
to standardize their languages.

486
00:30:52,090 --> 00:30:56,650
Perhaps it doesn't seem like a major
issue if a divided empire has divided

487
00:30:56,651 --> 00:31:00,100
languages, but many individuals
who did business across borders,

488
00:31:00,130 --> 00:31:04,360
like merchants and Holy Roman
emperors saw a benefit in uniformity.

489
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:09,160
Luther would be key to the German language
is standardization with is widespread

490
00:31:09,161 --> 00:31:13,690
German Bible. It was not by accident
that his Bible appeal to commoners.

491
00:31:13,810 --> 00:31:18,400
Luther went out of his way
to use vocabulary and grammar
that was regular among

492
00:31:18,401 --> 00:31:22,780
common folk and this laid the foundation
for the uniform development of the

493
00:31:22,781 --> 00:31:27,040
language. However, the other regional
dialects did not all disappear.

494
00:31:27,190 --> 00:31:32,190
Take these examples of Varian and all
the Monish compared to standard modern

495
00:31:32,291 --> 00:31:36,400
German, both still spoken and very
much alive though to a lesser extent.

496
00:31:36,970 --> 00:31:41,050
Some German dialects still around today
are very similar to standard German.

497
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:46,000
Others like these to find themselves on
the border of a dialect and a separate

498
00:31:46,001 --> 00:31:50,200
language, a bit like English and
Scots. So maybe even more distinct.

499
00:31:50,410 --> 00:31:54,340
You may have noticed that German has
what looks like some strange markings or

500
00:31:54,341 --> 00:31:55,960
accents more correctly.

501
00:31:55,990 --> 00:31:59,560
UHMM louts to explain these
just in the K to sound change.

502
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:03,580
So that margin becomes may Chinn,
which means girl Sam would,

503
00:32:03,581 --> 00:32:08,581
his maiden Boza is Busia many
evil tour is actually tour,

504
00:32:08,770 --> 00:32:13,090
which has the same root as and means door.
What about the fancy looking B?

505
00:32:13,270 --> 00:32:14,680
It's actually not a B.

506
00:32:14,710 --> 00:32:19,710
It's called an s set and represents under
a number of circumstances to ss like

507
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:22,390
in the word poison,
meaning Prussia.

508
00:32:22,780 --> 00:32:26,740
I actually took German in high school
and then did some self study later.

509
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:29,260
My German is nowhere near
as good as my French,

510
00:32:29,290 --> 00:32:32,860
but I'd say I'm at least
familiar with the basics. Anyway,

511
00:32:32,861 --> 00:32:36,820
I'd like to think my German teachers
for today's language segment,

512
00:32:40,310 --> 00:32:41,330
Friedrich Ville home.

513
00:32:41,331 --> 00:32:46,331
The second became king of Prussia in 1786
much of his reign was spent focused on

514
00:32:46,911 --> 00:32:50,990
events which would break out in France
three years later, the French revolution,

515
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:54,500
the French people rose up against
King Louis the 16th and his wife,

516
00:32:54,530 --> 00:32:59,120
Marie Antoinette. Not yet. At this
point in tending to create the republic,

517
00:32:59,121 --> 00:33:03,260
it would become the situation was still
concerning to all European monarchs,

518
00:33:03,261 --> 00:33:07,580
including German ones. If the people
could challenge the monarch of France,

519
00:33:07,670 --> 00:33:09,680
it could happen anywhere.
Furthermore,

520
00:33:09,770 --> 00:33:14,330
Emperor Yosef the second looked on the
situation with more personal concern as

521
00:33:14,331 --> 00:33:19,331
Marie Antoinette was his sister in
1791 the declaration of [inaudible] was

522
00:33:19,341 --> 00:33:24,170
issued declaring mutual Austrian and
Prussian support for Louis the 16th return

523
00:33:24,171 --> 00:33:29,171
to power in 1792 at led to the war of the
first coalition where the Germans were

524
00:33:29,631 --> 00:33:34,340
joined by other powers that as Britain
that year frons the second became holy

525
00:33:34,341 --> 00:33:35,150
Roman emperor.

526
00:33:35,150 --> 00:33:40,070
The coalition forces closed in on France
each seeking to restore a Louis 16 to

527
00:33:40,071 --> 00:33:42,560
the throne and take a piece
of France for themselves,

528
00:33:42,740 --> 00:33:46,220
but the revolutionaries proved
fully able to defend themselves.

529
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:51,640
In January of 1793 Louis the 16th
was executed later that year.

530
00:33:51,890 --> 00:33:53,800
His wife followed him to the gaiety.

531
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:58,960
The war continued until 1797 with a
French victory and occupation of western

532
00:33:59,421 --> 00:34:03,590
Germany. While this was occurring,
pressure was distracted by other affairs,

533
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:06,980
namely the second and
third partitions of Poland,

534
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:10,340
where Polish territory was
completely divided between Prussia,

535
00:34:10,341 --> 00:34:11,420
Austria and Russia,

536
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:16,480
and the nation itself ceased to exist
in 1797 the war of the second coalition

537
00:34:17,421 --> 00:34:20,030
broke out, which saw a Russia
enter, but not pressure.

538
00:34:20,210 --> 00:34:24,470
It would last until 1801 with the
same poor results for the allies.

539
00:34:24,650 --> 00:34:25,310
Furthermore,

540
00:34:25,310 --> 00:34:30,310
a young General Napoleon Bonaparte had
to become first console of France in 1799

541
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:35,510
in a coup d'etat, bringing an end to
the chaos of the French revolution.

542
00:34:35,870 --> 00:34:40,500
But a greater challenge for the Germans
is military genius was already shown at

543
00:34:40,501 --> 00:34:44,600
a number of battles against
Austria and Italy in 1803 however,

544
00:34:44,630 --> 00:34:49,340
war was back on yet again. Austria was
enthusiastically involved, but again,

545
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:52,030
not Prussia King Friedrich Ville home.
The third,

546
00:34:52,031 --> 00:34:56,510
his intention was to enjoy a neutrality
as Europe tore itself apart. So his wife,

547
00:34:56,540 --> 00:35:00,740
Louisa, was becoming increasingly
supportive of joining the coalition.

548
00:35:00,980 --> 00:35:05,330
Napoleon's attention was eventually on
pushing east and the own campaign in

549
00:35:05,331 --> 00:35:10,331
October of 1805 the Austrian army was
crushed is 60,000 men were captured.

550
00:35:11,030 --> 00:35:14,810
Whereas the Polian took only 2000 losses.
In November,

551
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:16,940
Napoleon took Vienna itself,

552
00:35:17,150 --> 00:35:21,500
and on the summer second that combined
Austrian and Russian armies were again a

553
00:35:21,510 --> 00:35:23,930
steroid at the famous
battle of Austerlitz,

554
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:28,610
forcing Austria to surrender following
this surrender cause or fronds.

555
00:35:28,610 --> 00:35:33,610
The second made the bold move to dissolve
the holy Roman empire and abdicate

556
00:35:34,341 --> 00:35:36,080
from the position of Emperor,

557
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:41,440
the empire seen by Napoleon as an
archaic and inefficient organization.

558
00:35:41,550 --> 00:35:46,380
Long overdue for reform was transformed
into a French satellite state,

559
00:35:46,410 --> 00:35:50,220
known as the Ryan booned or
the Confederation of the Rhine.

560
00:35:50,340 --> 00:35:51,900
Around the same time,
however,

561
00:35:51,901 --> 00:35:56,901
Emperor Franz did change his Austrian
title from Archduke of Austria to Emperor

562
00:35:57,181 --> 00:35:58,014
of Austria.

563
00:35:58,110 --> 00:36:01,590
One might think that the biggest losers
here would have been these smaller

564
00:36:01,591 --> 00:36:06,180
German states. On the contrary. Some
of them, such as Bavaria in Gutenberg,

565
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:10,470
had actually sided with Napoleon and
not only got Austria off their backs,

566
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:12,120
but with the empire dissolved,

567
00:36:12,270 --> 00:36:16,410
we're able to absorb many
of the neighboring patches
of microstates and start

568
00:36:16,411 --> 00:36:20,160
calling themselves kings.
There. Power had grown overall,

569
00:36:20,190 --> 00:36:24,940
but the confederation of the Rhine was
still a loose union of about 35 semi

570
00:36:24,941 --> 00:36:28,290
independent states.
Now under a more powerful emperor,

571
00:36:28,470 --> 00:36:31,170
the days of principalities,
the size of cities,

572
00:36:31,171 --> 00:36:33,960
we're coming to a close
except for leakage dine,

573
00:36:33,990 --> 00:36:36,420
which remains the living
remnant of the empire today,

574
00:36:36,540 --> 00:36:38,820
more on that country in
a future video of them.

575
00:36:39,270 --> 00:36:42,990
It was now clear to the Prussians that
they had remained neutral for too long

576
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:46,110
and a few months later they
declared war on Napoleon,

577
00:36:46,410 --> 00:36:49,890
but the military prowess of Friedrich
the great was not present and his

578
00:36:49,891 --> 00:36:53,700
successors and the French defeated the
Prussians heavily at the battles of Yana

579
00:36:53,730 --> 00:36:57,360
and our Stott and eventually took Perlin.
The following year,

580
00:36:57,420 --> 00:36:59,780
a peace treaty was signed,
which included pressures,

581
00:36:59,790 --> 00:37:03,450
loss of land to the other German states,
and the new Duchy of Poland.

582
00:37:03,690 --> 00:37:07,620
By 1813 however, the tables had
finally turned on the Polian,

583
00:37:07,710 --> 00:37:12,270
but disasters of the Iberian campaign in
Spain and his failed invasion of Russia

584
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:16,950
enticed the allies including Austria
and Prussia to challenge him once more.

585
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:21,660
Napoleon was defeated at the battle of
Leipzig, but a sys of coalition victory,

586
00:37:21,690 --> 00:37:24,180
which would encourage the
Ryan Boone to break apart.

587
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:28,320
And four napoleons German
satellites states to now
switch sides and opposed him.

588
00:37:28,410 --> 00:37:31,500
By 1814 the coalition had taken Paris.

589
00:37:31,620 --> 00:37:34,860
Napoleon was defeated and exiled.
Famously,

590
00:37:34,861 --> 00:37:39,450
he would escape this exile and 1815
and returned to take power once again,

591
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:42,420
but he was defeated again by Britain,
Prussia,

592
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:46,800
and other German forces at
Waterloo and exiled once more.

593
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:52,100
Most Germans then and today would consider
Napoleon a historic adversary with

594
00:37:52,531 --> 00:37:56,670
the contribution he made to
the restructuring of Germany
should not be ignored.

595
00:37:56,910 --> 00:38:01,910
At the Congress of Vienna from 1814 to
1815 overseen by Austrian Cummins von

596
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:06,660
Metronik. The European powers
met to effectively redraw Europe.

597
00:38:06,870 --> 00:38:11,640
The Confederation of the Ryan was not
replaced with a revival of the holy Roman

598
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:14,930
Empire, but with the German
confederation or the Deutsche of wound,

599
00:38:15,030 --> 00:38:19,500
which combine the features of both the
holy Roman Empire and the Confederation

600
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:23,460
of the Rhine. It was a little more like
the old empire and its ineffectiveness.

601
00:38:23,550 --> 00:38:27,990
It included parts of but not
all of Austria and Prussia
and the president of the

602
00:38:27,991 --> 00:38:30,060
confederation was the Austrian emperor,

603
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:34,620
but it only involved around 39 states
and followed many of Napoleon's

604
00:38:34,630 --> 00:38:36,190
organizational reforms.

605
00:38:36,310 --> 00:38:39,910
Yet the German confederation could not
really be called much more of a country

606
00:38:39,911 --> 00:38:40,870
then you old empire.

607
00:38:41,050 --> 00:38:45,550
It was more like a diplomatic assembly
than an actual congress and that even

608
00:38:45,551 --> 00:38:49,990
included the king of Denmark as Duke of
Holstine and King of Britain as the king

609
00:38:49,991 --> 00:38:50,824
of Pan over.

610
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:55,660
The intention of the main power is was
to remodel Europe based off the old order

611
00:38:55,661 --> 00:38:59,770
wants to pull the and had fallen. Though
with some important territorial changes,

612
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:01,540
Russia would gain.
Poland,

613
00:39:01,830 --> 00:39:04,900
Prussia would gain a large amount
of land in western Germany.

614
00:39:05,410 --> 00:39:08,500
The congress of Vienna had
a profound impact on Europe.

615
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:13,330
Perhaps one of the most peaceful ages of
Europe's history followed as from 1815

616
00:39:13,331 --> 00:39:15,880
to 1914 nearly a hundred years,

617
00:39:15,940 --> 00:39:20,260
not many major military conflicts between
the great European powers erupted.

618
00:39:20,290 --> 00:39:22,690
Though there were still
some important ones,

619
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:27,370
despite some clamor for reform
and internal tensions externally,

620
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:32,400
these German borders here basically
remained the same until the 1860s yet

621
00:39:32,561 --> 00:39:36,490
tension was building so there was
still no Germany as we know it today.

622
00:39:36,550 --> 00:39:40,960
Nationalism reform and a new philosophy
was spreading across the continent,

623
00:39:40,990 --> 00:39:45,430
which helps encourage the notion of German
unity and challenge the views of the

624
00:39:45,431 --> 00:39:49,630
age. Austria was a traditional
overseer of the German nations,

625
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:53,560
but Prussia was becoming a serious
challenger, adding to the issue.

626
00:39:54,130 --> 00:39:59,030
As German reformers faced censorship
and oppression and many Germans faced a

627
00:39:59,031 --> 00:40:00,670
general overpopulation.

628
00:40:00,730 --> 00:40:05,110
Many of them decided to emigrate to new
countries such as the United States,

629
00:40:05,170 --> 00:40:06,850
Canada,
and South America.

630
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:10,840
The immigrants brought their culture in
lifestyles with them introducing to the

631
00:40:10,841 --> 00:40:15,340
world and new foods like the hamburger
and strange holiday traditions such as

632
00:40:15,341 --> 00:40:18,640
decorating what they called a
Christmas tree. In some areas,

633
00:40:18,641 --> 00:40:22,570
especially in South America, they're
language is still spoken. However,

634
00:40:22,571 --> 00:40:27,370
in the u s where a German Americans are
the number one most common ethnic group

635
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:30,250
as 14.4% of the population,

636
00:40:30,370 --> 00:40:33,370
the language largely disappeared
during the simulation.

637
00:40:33,550 --> 00:40:38,550
By 1848 discontent became full blown
revolution across not only Germany,

638
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:40,390
but many nations of Europe.

639
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:45,130
The communist manifesto was
not by coincidence published
in Germany that year.

640
00:40:45,430 --> 00:40:49,540
Political tension was exacerbated by
feminines economic hardships and other

641
00:40:49,541 --> 00:40:53,320
nationalistic separatists movements
such as in Hungary. Initially,

642
00:40:53,321 --> 00:40:57,550
these movements oversaw successful reforms
and even the beginning of what looked

643
00:40:57,551 --> 00:41:02,551
like a German nation as the Frankfurt
National Assembly formed in May of that

644
00:41:02,890 --> 00:41:06,370
year. What exactly this German
nation should look like. However,

645
00:41:06,430 --> 00:41:10,750
was the first topic of debate,
some favor to gross Deutschland,

646
00:41:10,810 --> 00:41:15,430
meaning large Germany favoring
unification of all Germany with Austria,

647
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:18,820
others favorite Kleine Deutschland,
small Germany,

648
00:41:18,890 --> 00:41:22,960
x including Austria and it's many
troublesome non German domains.

649
00:41:23,110 --> 00:41:27,160
The nationalists therefore either way
look to Prussia to lead the way to the

650
00:41:27,161 --> 00:41:28,960
creation of this germination,

651
00:41:28,990 --> 00:41:31,960
but King Fredrick Phil how and
the fourth would let them down.

652
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:37,200
He refused the of what would be Germany
and by 1849 the conservative factions

653
00:41:37,671 --> 00:41:41,390
were winning again and the revolution
including the Frankfort parliament

654
00:41:41,420 --> 00:41:46,420
dispersed their idea of a Germany would
remain theoretical for some decades.

655
00:41:47,030 --> 00:41:51,080
Friedrich Wilhelm was not interested in
the political limitations imposed by the

656
00:41:51,081 --> 00:41:54,290
revolutionaries nor in a war
with Austria over the issue.

657
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:59,210
But he was not completely averse to
the notion of a United Germany overall

658
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:01,070
tension was already a building the twin,

659
00:42:01,071 --> 00:42:06,071
the two powers and temporarily it seemed
as though war would erupt in 1850s but

660
00:42:06,230 --> 00:42:09,080
it was averted or more
correctly postponed.

661
00:42:09,380 --> 00:42:13,370
And the 1860s with tension of her power
and the Prussian government between the

662
00:42:13,371 --> 00:42:17,810
king and the new parliament known
as the long tog a bright and active

663
00:42:17,811 --> 00:42:22,610
conservative politician named Otto von
Bismarck was called upon to help resolve

664
00:42:22,611 --> 00:42:27,500
the disputes in 1862 he was made minister,
president of Prussia,

665
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:31,970
essentially second only to the king,
the well educated in a skilled diplomat.

666
00:42:32,030 --> 00:42:36,710
Bismarck famously stated that Germany
will be forged by iron and blood.

667
00:42:36,890 --> 00:42:37,910
Two years later,

668
00:42:37,940 --> 00:42:41,660
his statement was challenged as Denmark
attempted to annex a territory of

669
00:42:41,730 --> 00:42:45,950
Chesapeake Holstine, sparking war
with both Prussia and Austria,

670
00:42:46,010 --> 00:42:47,540
which the German allies won.

671
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:51,260
The conquered territory was divided
between Prussia and Austria,

672
00:42:51,290 --> 00:42:52,640
but as you can see,

673
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:57,110
reaching the region was somewhat awkward
for Austria and the administration over.

674
00:42:57,111 --> 00:42:59,960
It was a subject of contention
between the two powers.

675
00:43:00,170 --> 00:43:03,440
It would eventually become an
excuse for war. Between the two.

676
00:43:03,590 --> 00:43:08,590
In June of 1866 he Ostrow Prussian war
broke out a conflict for which Bismarck

677
00:43:09,531 --> 00:43:13,340
was prepared already ensuring the
new nation of Italy as an ally.

678
00:43:13,790 --> 00:43:15,920
A number of German states joined Prussia,

679
00:43:15,921 --> 00:43:19,250
but Austria was joined by
the more major German states.

680
00:43:19,340 --> 00:43:23,270
The war would last for only seven
weeks with a decisive Prussian victory.

681
00:43:23,271 --> 00:43:27,080
Decided at the battle of Cuny greats.
Following this war,

682
00:43:27,110 --> 00:43:31,490
the German confederation was dissolved
and replaced with the Prussian north

683
00:43:31,491 --> 00:43:32,630
German confederation.

684
00:43:32,990 --> 00:43:37,280
The tables had turned and now Prussia
was seemingly the dominant German nation.

685
00:43:37,700 --> 00:43:39,140
From this moment forward,

686
00:43:39,260 --> 00:43:43,430
Germany and Austria would be
destined to different paths. However,

687
00:43:43,431 --> 00:43:47,780
southern Germany still
remained independent largely
because of internal and

688
00:43:47,781 --> 00:43:48,720
external IEE.

689
00:43:48,770 --> 00:43:53,770
French concerns over full German
unification in 1870 amid rising tensions,

690
00:43:54,830 --> 00:43:59,420
war will be declared between France
and Prussia remembered as the Franco

691
00:43:59,420 --> 00:44:02,600
Prussian war. Thanks to clever
maneuvering and propaganda.

692
00:44:02,690 --> 00:44:06,620
France was viewed as the aggressor
and much of southern Germany feeling

693
00:44:06,621 --> 00:44:11,120
threatened. Allied with the north, which
is precisely what Bismarck intended.

694
00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:14,360
This war would also be short
lasting only six months.

695
00:44:14,450 --> 00:44:19,450
Ending in January of 1871 the French
commanders made a number of egregious

696
00:44:19,641 --> 00:44:23,990
errors resulting in a decisive
Prussian victory of great importance.

697
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:28,430
Slowly the German states still outside
of the confederation move towards

698
00:44:28,431 --> 00:44:33,240
unification with the rest of Germany.
The last to do so being Bavaria,

699
00:44:33,570 --> 00:44:38,570
that same year the north of
German confederation became
the German Empire under

700
00:44:39,121 --> 00:44:40,050
Kaiser Wilhelm,

701
00:44:40,051 --> 00:44:44,880
the first Chancellor Bismarck and they
right stock a parliament modeled after

702
00:44:44,881 --> 00:44:49,050
the imperial diets and
thus a nation was born.

703
00:44:49,980 --> 00:44:54,900
This nation, however, born from rapid
change, had yet much more change to endure

704
00:44:59,090 --> 00:45:03,900
in 1888 to Ville home. The first was
succeeded by his 29 year old grandson.

705
00:45:03,930 --> 00:45:08,190
They'll Helms Second Ville home.
The second was impulsive, excitable,

706
00:45:08,220 --> 00:45:09,150
and reckless,

707
00:45:09,210 --> 00:45:13,620
possibly suffering from what some
historians believe resembles a personality

708
00:45:13,621 --> 00:45:14,220
disorder.

709
00:45:14,220 --> 00:45:18,330
He stood in stark contrast to Bismarck
and the two quickie got off on the wrong

710
00:45:18,331 --> 00:45:22,590
foot in a time when the relative peace
following the Napoleonic wars was

711
00:45:22,591 --> 00:45:26,760
studying to end as tension was building
between the European powers Villa home,

712
00:45:26,761 --> 00:45:29,250
the second to dismiss
to Bismarck from office.

713
00:45:29,340 --> 00:45:34,340
A decade later in 1897 Bismarck made two
famous statements to Ville home while

714
00:45:34,861 --> 00:45:36,840
visiting him for the last time.

715
00:45:37,050 --> 00:45:40,620
He warned him that in
just a matter of 20 years,

716
00:45:40,950 --> 00:45:44,070
a great war would come if
nothing was done to stop,

717
00:45:44,071 --> 00:45:48,480
it sparked by some damned foolish thing.
And the Balkans as he put it.

718
00:45:48,570 --> 00:45:53,570
Bismarck died a year later at the age
of 83 16 years before he would be proven

719
00:45:54,061 --> 00:45:57,300
correct.
It is eerie how accurate Bismarck was,

720
00:45:57,360 --> 00:46:01,860
but was he psychic or was he a competent
statesman who saw what Kaiser Wilhelm

721
00:46:01,861 --> 00:46:05,340
did not see despite what lay ahead.
For the time being,

722
00:46:05,430 --> 00:46:09,960
Kaiser Wilhelm ruled over
a booming nation. Germany
became a center for Science,

723
00:46:09,961 --> 00:46:14,700
technology, industry, commerce, and
culture. The late to the colonialism game,

724
00:46:14,730 --> 00:46:18,030
it established a number of colonies
in Africa and Southeast Asia.

725
00:46:18,070 --> 00:46:22,500
In the areas of modern day, Papa, New
Guinea, Cameroon, Namibia, and Tanzania.

726
00:46:22,680 --> 00:46:26,580
Germany would also begin a military
buildup which concerned France, Russia,

727
00:46:26,581 --> 00:46:30,870
and Britain. In particular, the triple
alliance of Germany, Austria, Hungary,

728
00:46:30,871 --> 00:46:35,871
and Italy had been formed in the 1880s
and response in 1907 the triple entente

729
00:46:36,871 --> 00:46:37,530
of Britain,

730
00:46:37,530 --> 00:46:42,530
France and Russia had been formed on June
28th of 1914 the dominoes set in place

731
00:46:43,801 --> 00:46:44,940
came falling down.

732
00:46:45,020 --> 00:46:49,890
We're all the war one began archduke
Franz fed and on of Austria was

733
00:46:49,891 --> 00:46:53,340
assassinated by a Serbian
nationalists and response.

734
00:46:53,370 --> 00:46:55,050
Austria invaded Serbia,

735
00:46:55,290 --> 00:46:59,970
the complex string of alliances as
soon came into effect and by August,

736
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:04,500
Germany and Austria, Hungary, the
central powers, we're at war with Russia,

737
00:47:04,530 --> 00:47:08,730
France, Britain, Serbia to Belgium
and Japan, the allied powers.

738
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:09,930
Within that year,

739
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:13,830
the Ottomans would join the central
powers and the year after Italy joined the

740
00:47:13,831 --> 00:47:16,740
allied side.
Despite pass alliances with Germany,

741
00:47:16,890 --> 00:47:21,480
blame for who exactly started the war
remains a topic of debate. However,

742
00:47:21,481 --> 00:47:25,710
it is very evident that all the major
powers were readily prepared for it.

743
00:47:25,770 --> 00:47:30,770
Germany attempted first to invade France
or Belgium and which forced Belgium to

744
00:47:30,881 --> 00:47:33,340
defend itself.
Though it had wanted to remain neutral,

745
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:35,170
which encouraged British involvement.

746
00:47:35,230 --> 00:47:39,370
Germany surrounded by enemies wanted to
achieve victory as quickly as possible,

747
00:47:39,490 --> 00:47:43,180
though fighting on two fronts, things
initially were going well for Germany,

748
00:47:43,240 --> 00:47:45,100
but at the first battle of the Marne,

749
00:47:45,130 --> 00:47:47,830
they were prevented from
reaching Paris very quickly.

750
00:47:47,890 --> 00:47:50,170
The violence continued territorially.

751
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:54,880
It stagnated as both sides
dug into defensive positions
across the entire border

752
00:47:54,910 --> 00:47:58,780
leading to the infamous trench warfare.
Germany's colonies in Asia,

753
00:47:58,840 --> 00:48:03,640
poorly prepared for war quickly fell to
Japan and British forces from Australia

754
00:48:03,641 --> 00:48:05,380
and New Zealand.
However,

755
00:48:05,410 --> 00:48:09,850
and the African colonies war raged on
a war that was supposed to be over by

756
00:48:09,851 --> 00:48:14,230
Christmas with a Glorious Durban victory
was now clearly going to drag on into

757
00:48:14,231 --> 00:48:18,370
1915 Germany was strained not
only by fighting on two fronts,

758
00:48:18,371 --> 00:48:22,870
but also being the driving force of the
central powers. Neither Austria, Hungary,

759
00:48:22,871 --> 00:48:25,270
nor the Ottomans were the
empires they used to be,

760
00:48:25,300 --> 00:48:29,440
and Austria in particular with spending
against the Russia and even Serbia and

761
00:48:29,441 --> 00:48:31,300
would soon be stagnating with Italy,

762
00:48:31,390 --> 00:48:35,470
Kaiser Ville Helm was reduced to
being the shadow Kaiser sitting on the

763
00:48:35,471 --> 00:48:39,010
sidelines as his military effectively
took control of the nation.

764
00:48:39,190 --> 00:48:41,530
Gradually the war shifted focus.

765
00:48:41,650 --> 00:48:45,910
Originally the commanders on accustomed
to this new style of warfare.

766
00:48:46,030 --> 00:48:49,330
We're seeking great decisive
battles in quick movements.

767
00:48:49,450 --> 00:48:54,450
In 1915 and 16 it became clear that
that was not how the war was going to be

768
00:48:54,551 --> 00:48:59,380
fought and that instead it became a war
of attrition where each side fight each

769
00:48:59,381 --> 00:49:03,010
other and battles and offensive that
would cost hundreds of thousands and

770
00:49:03,011 --> 00:49:06,700
gradually millions of lives in
attempts to deplete the enemy's men.

771
00:49:06,701 --> 00:49:11,440
And restores is faster with
new devastating technology
such as machine guns,

772
00:49:11,500 --> 00:49:15,430
tanks, submarines, and poison
gas. Halfway through the war,

773
00:49:15,490 --> 00:49:17,800
neither side had yet a clear advantage,

774
00:49:17,830 --> 00:49:21,580
but Germany knew deep down that if it
were a game of who could supply the most

775
00:49:21,581 --> 00:49:25,270
men in resources,
the allies would slowly when knowing this,

776
00:49:25,300 --> 00:49:27,610
both sides gradually
became more aggressive.

777
00:49:27,790 --> 00:49:31,810
Germany breathe a sigh of relief when
Russia exited the war following the

778
00:49:31,811 --> 00:49:36,340
communist revolution in 1917 but it was
a little comfort as over the course of

779
00:49:36,341 --> 00:49:40,360
1916 and 17 how to deal with new enemies.
Most notably,

780
00:49:40,390 --> 00:49:41,470
the United States.

781
00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:44,860
America had tried to remain neutral
throughout the course of the war,

782
00:49:44,861 --> 00:49:49,540
but it had been provoked by German
attacks on some of its ships and a secret

783
00:49:49,541 --> 00:49:52,090
proposal to Mexico to
become a German ally.

784
00:49:52,091 --> 00:49:55,510
If America did enter the war
in Germany's defense, however,

785
00:49:55,511 --> 00:50:00,340
America was clearly leaning towards the
side and indirectly assisting the allies,

786
00:50:00,790 --> 00:50:01,271
the Germans,

787
00:50:01,271 --> 00:50:05,710
new fresh American reinforcements could
finally tip the balance in favor of the

788
00:50:05,711 --> 00:50:06,220
allies.

789
00:50:06,220 --> 00:50:11,220
And that is essentially exactly what
happened in 1918 the allies initiated one

790
00:50:11,651 --> 00:50:15,070
final push against Germany. And though
the central powers fought fiercely.

791
00:50:15,100 --> 00:50:17,110
By November 11th the war was over.

792
00:50:17,350 --> 00:50:22,350
Germany had to surrender despite the
fact that the war lasted only for years.

793
00:50:22,481 --> 00:50:27,040
It was essentially the most destructive
conflict and human history. Up to that.

794
00:50:27,650 --> 00:50:31,610
Estimates vary, but perhaps around
18 million people were killed.

795
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:36,920
With the subsequent treaty of Versailles
in June of 1919 the Austrian and

796
00:50:36,921 --> 00:50:40,550
Ottoman Empire is we're
completely dissolved and
broken up into multiple other

797
00:50:40,551 --> 00:50:44,900
states, Germany to would have to
make serious concessions. Firstly,

798
00:50:44,930 --> 00:50:48,320
it's overseas colonies were
annexed by Britain and France.

799
00:50:48,350 --> 00:50:52,400
It's mainland territory was divided
into new nations or given to France.

800
00:50:52,430 --> 00:50:54,800
The army was drastically reduced in size.

801
00:50:54,920 --> 00:50:59,570
It accepted responsibility for the war
and was expected to pay reparations for

802
00:50:59,571 --> 00:51:03,530
the damage it had caused.
The German empire was over.

803
00:51:03,590 --> 00:51:05,780
Kaiser Wilhelm had already abdicated.

804
00:51:06,020 --> 00:51:10,400
Germany was now set to become a republic.
The Weimar Republic,

805
00:51:10,940 --> 00:51:15,560
Germany was humiliated and broken by as
the feet and the peace terms forced upon

806
00:51:15,561 --> 00:51:18,140
it to Delta,
yet another major blow to the nation.

807
00:51:18,260 --> 00:51:21,380
The hard shifts the nation
would soon be facing and shame,

808
00:51:21,381 --> 00:51:25,880
it felt would lead to an eventual
backlash and unleash yet another major

809
00:51:25,881 --> 00:51:30,230
conflict on the world that no
one could have predicted. Well,

810
00:51:30,260 --> 00:51:33,890
actually numerous people predicted it,
but either way it was coming

811
00:51:37,010 --> 00:51:38,480
as one might expect.

812
00:51:38,510 --> 00:51:41,420
The years immediately following
the end of the war for Germany,

813
00:51:41,421 --> 00:51:44,360
we're a chaotic and
turbulent various factions,

814
00:51:44,361 --> 00:51:46,910
including notably multiple
socialist factions,

815
00:51:46,970 --> 00:51:51,380
attempted to use the chaos as an
opportunity to seize power in Bavaria.

816
00:51:51,470 --> 00:51:56,470
A socialist republic was even temporarily
proclaimed in April of 1919 but was

817
00:51:56,691 --> 00:52:00,170
disestablished in May, an event
among others, socialists Nomans,

818
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:04,400
which concerned the more moderate
German people among the Bavarians who

819
00:52:04,401 --> 00:52:08,300
witnessed this firsthand was an Austrian
who had served in the German army,

820
00:52:08,630 --> 00:52:13,100
adult Hitler to add fuel to the
antisemitism in Europe. At the time,

821
00:52:13,310 --> 00:52:17,690
many activists such as a Rosa Luxemburg
and the Bavarian Socialists states

822
00:52:17,691 --> 00:52:20,030
leader,
Oregon Levina were Jewish.

823
00:52:20,150 --> 00:52:24,860
The German economy slowly took a hit
in the 1920s as inflation became worse,

824
00:52:24,890 --> 00:52:27,680
as the government printed more
money to pay for its debts,

825
00:52:27,740 --> 00:52:32,480
the inflation reached levels of outright
absurdity far right and left wing

826
00:52:32,481 --> 00:52:34,910
groups attempted to
capitalize on the crisis.

827
00:52:35,150 --> 00:52:38,800
One such right wing party was he nuts.
Announced Socialistic Disha Deutscher,

828
00:52:38,810 --> 00:52:40,610
our batch apartheid in English,

829
00:52:40,611 --> 00:52:45,290
abbreviated as the Nazi party under
the Afa mentioned at all. Hitler,

830
00:52:45,830 --> 00:52:50,480
Hitler's spoke of a Germany controlled
by and ruined by a Jewish elite end of a

831
00:52:50,481 --> 00:52:50,931
Germany,

832
00:52:50,931 --> 00:52:55,790
which had been unfairly abused by the
allies of the first world war is national

833
00:52:55,791 --> 00:52:59,990
socialist ideology he promised would
reinvigorate Germany and restore its

834
00:52:59,991 --> 00:53:04,130
dignity and honor despite attempts
to prevent his rise to power.

835
00:53:04,190 --> 00:53:08,540
On January 30th,
1933 Hitler became in German chancellor.

836
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:10,880
Upon his rise to office,

837
00:53:10,910 --> 00:53:15,740
Hitler immediately set about consolidating
power and silencing the multitude of

838
00:53:15,741 --> 00:53:17,180
political parties in Germany.

839
00:53:17,181 --> 00:53:21,650
At the time he began building up his army
and breaking many of the agreements of

840
00:53:21,651 --> 00:53:25,470
the precise treaty, partially in
secret, partially right in the open.

841
00:53:25,650 --> 00:53:30,300
By march of 1938 Austria was
annexed by Germany. By September,

842
00:53:30,330 --> 00:53:35,010
the Sudeten land of the Czech Republic
was annexed. The international community,

843
00:53:35,070 --> 00:53:35,910
or in other words,

844
00:53:35,911 --> 00:53:40,120
Britain and France were very reluctant
to start another war and thus allowed

845
00:53:40,140 --> 00:53:43,140
Germany to NXTs ethnically German areas.

846
00:53:43,230 --> 00:53:46,470
Heather then decided to invade
the rest of the Czech Republic.

847
00:53:46,560 --> 00:53:51,150
Little was done in response,
but la only gave Hitler precious time.

848
00:53:51,330 --> 00:53:55,290
When Germany invaded Poland on
September 1st in 1939 however,

849
00:53:55,320 --> 00:53:59,630
Britain and France were forced to
declare war Hitler using his uplifts.

850
00:53:59,631 --> 00:54:04,110
Craig tactics rolled right through Poland
and a period known as the phony war,

851
00:54:04,111 --> 00:54:07,500
followed as attempts to resolve the
issues diplomatically were made.

852
00:54:07,800 --> 00:54:10,380
Diplomatic resolution did not come in.

853
00:54:10,381 --> 00:54:14,760
Germany merely reaffirmed its goals
and alliances with Japan and Italy who

854
00:54:14,761 --> 00:54:16,080
shared similar goals.

855
00:54:16,230 --> 00:54:20,490
1940 will be marked by a series of
unprecedented victories for the Germans,

856
00:54:20,520 --> 00:54:24,390
defeating multiple European nations
within months or even hours.

857
00:54:24,600 --> 00:54:29,430
The rapid unexpected fall of France
in June of 1940 inspire the Germans,

858
00:54:29,460 --> 00:54:32,730
but the British remained resilient.
Vowing to never surrender.

859
00:54:32,970 --> 00:54:37,230
German plans to invade Britain were upheld
by the invasion of the Soviet Union.

860
00:54:37,260 --> 00:54:42,260
Coined Operation Barbarosa occurred the
year after in June of 1941 the initial

861
00:54:42,781 --> 00:54:47,160
invasion once it's planned until the
winter when the German forces unprepared

862
00:54:47,161 --> 00:54:51,450
for a long conflict over the winter began
to stagnate and the Russians actually

863
00:54:51,451 --> 00:54:54,240
somewhat started to repel
them that winter as well.

864
00:54:54,330 --> 00:54:59,220
Japan declared war on America and Heather
joined them despite now provoking two

865
00:54:59,221 --> 00:55:00,180
major powers.

866
00:55:00,210 --> 00:55:05,210
German military successes continued
into 1942 it is during 1941 or so when

867
00:55:06,001 --> 00:55:07,920
Hitler gain control on the eastern front.

868
00:55:07,950 --> 00:55:10,620
That is racial designs
came further into play.

869
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:14,820
Drawing on accounts as far back as Rome
of the blonde haired blue eyed gear

870
00:55:14,821 --> 00:55:15,390
money.

871
00:55:15,390 --> 00:55:19,140
Hitler believed that the dramatic peoples
where the most pure and superior of

872
00:55:19,141 --> 00:55:20,160
the area and race,

873
00:55:20,220 --> 00:55:24,270
he viewed other races with contempt
and endeavor to remove many of them to

874
00:55:24,271 --> 00:55:27,960
create layman's around or living
space for the German people,

875
00:55:28,110 --> 00:55:33,000
millions of homosexuals, Gypsies, the
Disabled Slavs that Jehovah's Witnesses,

876
00:55:33,001 --> 00:55:36,940
Africans, and most infamously, the
Jews were all targets of what does.

877
00:55:36,941 --> 00:55:41,941
Remember it as the Holocaust forced
into labor camps or eventually killed by

878
00:55:42,151 --> 00:55:46,740
fall of 1943 the borders of the axis
powers were starting to attract.

879
00:55:46,770 --> 00:55:50,460
Russia was reclaiming territory
and the allies were invading Italy.

880
00:55:50,580 --> 00:55:54,150
The following year on June 6th
as Russia continued its advanced,

881
00:55:54,180 --> 00:55:58,260
the allied forces from a multitude of
nations landed on the beaches of Normandy

882
00:55:58,261 --> 00:55:59,094
in France.

883
00:55:59,220 --> 00:56:03,900
By December of 1944 the Third Reich was
clearly starting to be reduced to its

884
00:56:03,901 --> 00:56:08,100
original borders. That month hit. They're
launched his last major offensive,

885
00:56:08,130 --> 00:56:10,530
which resulted in the battle of the bulge.

886
00:56:10,560 --> 00:56:14,700
By January it had failed and that was
soon clear that Germany would not win the

887
00:56:14,701 --> 00:56:19,650
war. On April 30th as the Soviets
took Berlin, Hitler committed suicide.

888
00:56:19,710 --> 00:56:22,830
On May 8th Germany officially
surrendered to the allied.

889
00:56:23,530 --> 00:56:27,850
It had been the most destructive conflict
and world history and remains so to

890
00:56:27,851 --> 00:56:32,851
this day with 60 million people or around
3% of the world's population having

891
00:56:33,221 --> 00:56:37,180
been killed, including 7 million
Germans following the war,

892
00:56:37,240 --> 00:56:39,790
German territory was
divided among the allies.

893
00:56:39,880 --> 00:56:44,470
Poland was permanently given many of the
areas of the historic Prussian Empire.

894
00:56:44,530 --> 00:56:49,360
The militarism of Prussia was seen as the
driving force of the German militarism,

895
00:56:49,390 --> 00:56:52,300
which had caused the
world wars and in fact,

896
00:56:52,330 --> 00:56:54,670
Hitler had idolized Friedrich the grade.
Thus,

897
00:56:54,671 --> 00:56:57,460
it was seen as wise to
stamp out its image.

898
00:56:57,550 --> 00:57:01,870
Russia occupied the east of the nation
as well as territory near the city of

899
00:57:01,880 --> 00:57:05,890
Koenigsberg. The French occupied the
south west and these SAR protectorate,

900
00:57:05,980 --> 00:57:08,320
the British, the northwest,
and the Americans.

901
00:57:08,350 --> 00:57:12,610
The South Berlin was likewise split
between the four allies with the Soviets

902
00:57:12,611 --> 00:57:13,660
controlling the east.

903
00:57:13,690 --> 00:57:18,250
Germany had once again been defeated
this time with much harsher punishments.

904
00:57:18,280 --> 00:57:22,600
It would not be so quickly reunited. The
relationship between the western powers,

905
00:57:22,630 --> 00:57:26,830
notably the United States and the
Soviet Union was very tenuous.

906
00:57:26,860 --> 00:57:28,480
Even during the war Germany,

907
00:57:28,510 --> 00:57:32,950
we'd become a main battleground and the
immediate conflict which followed the

908
00:57:32,950 --> 00:57:36,550
Cold War from 1947 to 1991 gradually,

909
00:57:36,551 --> 00:57:40,060
the multiple occupied zones
became two separate countries.

910
00:57:40,180 --> 00:57:44,110
In 1949 after a period
known as the Nazi vacation,

911
00:57:44,230 --> 00:57:49,230
the Federal Republic of Germany or
western Germany and the German Democratic

912
00:57:49,390 --> 00:57:54,250
Republic or east to Germany were formed
after less than a century of unification,

913
00:57:54,340 --> 00:57:59,050
Germany was once again
divided as relations between
west and east became more

914
00:57:59,051 --> 00:58:01,960
and more tense.
Germany found itself in the middle.

915
00:58:02,080 --> 00:58:07,080
The Soviets and East Germans erected a
wall in 1961 in Berlin throughout the

916
00:58:08,410 --> 00:58:11,410
sixties and seventies the height of the
Cold War, a number of incidents occurred,

917
00:58:11,411 --> 00:58:15,550
which nearly resulted in war in Germany.
By the eighties however,

918
00:58:15,670 --> 00:58:17,290
tensions began to relax.

919
00:58:17,320 --> 00:58:22,320
By 1989 the East German government
had begun to falter on November 9th,

920
00:58:23,710 --> 00:58:28,180
1989 the Berlin Wall was opened officially
partially by a miscommunication,

921
00:58:28,210 --> 00:58:31,510
allowing Germans to cross much
more freely between borders.

922
00:58:31,720 --> 00:58:35,950
On October 3rd,
1990 after 40 years of the vision,

923
00:58:36,100 --> 00:58:40,060
Germany became a unified and
independent nation. Once again,

924
00:58:40,210 --> 00:58:44,710
largely in thanks to men such as
Helmut Kohl reunified Germany's first

925
00:58:44,711 --> 00:58:45,520
chancellor,

926
00:58:45,520 --> 00:58:50,260
October 3rd is still celebrated as the
togther Deutsch and Einheit the day of

927
00:58:50,261 --> 00:58:51,880
German unity.
Today,

928
00:58:51,910 --> 00:58:56,500
Germany remains a major nation in multiple
areas and carries considerable weight

929
00:58:56,501 --> 00:58:59,680
and the decisions that affect a
Europe, the west, and the planet.

930
00:59:00,010 --> 00:59:03,850
We have thus covered about
3000 years of German history,

931
00:59:03,880 --> 00:59:08,740
the story of Germany's ancestors,
as for the next 3000 years.

932
00:59:08,770 --> 00:59:12,910
That depends upon the decisions made
by the German people living today.

933
00:59:13,510 --> 00:59:15,910
