00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:21,430
Scientist working with NASA's Kepler
telescope believe they may have discover

2
00:00:21,431 --> 00:00:26,250
what may be the most earth like clone
at the date Kepler for 50 to be orbits.

3
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:29,680
It start at a very similar distance
at earth orbits. It's star. In fact,

4
00:00:29,681 --> 00:00:33,540
it's here is only 20 days longer.
It is likely a rocky planet for ups.

5
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:35,020
A billion years old was in the eras,

6
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:40,200
60% larger in 1400 light years away in
the constellation sickness because this

7
00:00:41,261 --> 00:00:43,930
world has been an orbit around its
star for around 6 billion years in the

8
00:00:43,931 --> 00:00:47,500
habitable zone, scientists are hopeful
that life has evolved in flourished here.

9
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:49,091
In fact,

10
00:00:49,091 --> 00:00:52,330
they're calling it the best chance so
far under just several earth like planets

11
00:00:52,331 --> 00:00:55,120
discovered,
including capita 20 to be

12
00:00:56,680 --> 00:01:00,270
scientist or not sure if the planner
host life and because it is 1400 layers

13
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:03,100
away, who not like they'd be a
certain for a decent amount of time.

14
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:06,550
Though they were saying that
plant's transported here
from Earth would likely be

15
00:01:06,551 --> 00:01:11,200
able to survive and someone could receive
a healthy tan. How healthy you have.

16
00:01:11,201 --> 00:01:13,780
A 10 though is yet to
be determined as again,

17
00:01:13,781 --> 00:01:18,040
much of the planet is still unknown
as well as completely redefining or

18
00:01:18,041 --> 00:01:20,640
understanding of biology and
a universe, Kepler, 42 B,

19
00:01:20,650 --> 00:01:24,130
and they provide insight on the future
of earth due to its greater age and its

20
00:01:24,131 --> 00:01:29,131
similarity to our planet Kepler for 50
to be maybe our best hope for Iti to date

21
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:32,740
that may indeed be among billions and
billions of life harboring planets in the

22
00:01:32,741 --> 00:01:37,150
universe in the end. Only a time and
perseverance hotel. What do you think?

23
00:01:37,151 --> 00:01:40,540
So could there be life on this world?
Would it be intelligent?
