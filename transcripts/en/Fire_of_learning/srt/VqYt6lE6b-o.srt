00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:04,650
Scientists have discovered the remains
of 15 partial skeletons in a burial

2
00:00:04,651 --> 00:00:08,760
chamber and South Africa, which they
believe is a new type of species of human.

3
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:14,340
It has been named the lady. The time in
which you live is not yet known fully.

4
00:00:14,341 --> 00:00:17,730
Those scientists estimate that it
was around 3 million years ago,

5
00:00:17,790 --> 00:00:21,960
meaning it is an important link in the
structure of the human family tree.

6
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:25,980
The remains discovered was tell us a
lot about our ancestors here and because

7
00:00:25,981 --> 00:00:28,500
there are 15 different
individual specimens,

8
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:30,930
we will have a large amount to learn.

9
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:34,950
Homeowner Letty is believed to have been
small brain based off the size of its

10
00:00:34,951 --> 00:00:36,210
skull.
However,

11
00:00:36,211 --> 00:00:40,230
it was clearly capable of the ritual
behavior of burying their dead.

12
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:45,420
This is a remarkable fine as this was
something that was believed to have been

13
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:47,730
unique to humans of the modern time.

14
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:53,190
Scientists are now fully aware that there
is much more to learn and now this is

15
00:00:53,191 --> 00:00:57,450
a creature that may change how we think
about ourselves even today as modern

16
00:00:57,451 --> 00:01:00,840
humans. For more videos about
science in many other subjects.
