00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,030
Hello and welcome the fire of learning
Britain from a small island nation to the

2
00:00:05,311 --> 00:00:10,311
largest empire the world has ever seen
an empire upon which the sun did not set

3
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:16,080
and in technicality still does nuts set.
How was this achieved?

4
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:20,910
What was the secret to Britain's
success in empire building?

5
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:22,650
Well,
to begin,

6
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:27,780
one of the first big reasons for Britain
success was geography from the start of

7
00:00:27,781 --> 00:00:28,321
the nation.

8
00:00:28,321 --> 00:00:33,240
England was protected from the conflicts
and interests of the continent by being

9
00:00:33,241 --> 00:00:37,500
surrounded on all sides by
water. Well, almost all sides.

10
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:42,090
You may remember Edward Longshanks
ranting about not controlling the whole of

11
00:00:42,091 --> 00:00:46,680
his island in the movie Braveheart and
his frustration was completely justified

12
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:51,300
if the island where unified it would
provide an important strategic advantage

13
00:00:51,301 --> 00:00:54,000
for England getting whales
and especially Scotland,

14
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:58,560
who was historically an enemy of England
and worst and ally of the arch nemesis,

15
00:00:58,561 --> 00:01:00,480
France off their backs.

16
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:05,630
This was essentially achieved in 1603
when King James became the monarch of

17
00:01:06,091 --> 00:01:10,530
England, Scotland and Ireland and
England started to become Britain.

18
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:14,880
Giving it a complete shield of
sea water is a nice advantage.

19
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:18,870
It makes it harder for enemies to come
into your territory if they must also

20
00:01:18,871 --> 00:01:19,950
travel by sea,

21
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:24,300
but C's are not impenetrable and the
English learned that lesson the hard way.

22
00:01:24,301 --> 00:01:26,730
Early on in the early Middle Ages,

23
00:01:26,731 --> 00:01:31,110
the English went up against the power
with a superior navy. The Vikings,

24
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:35,280
the vikings spread havoc on England
and nearly conquered the Anglo Saxon

25
00:01:35,281 --> 00:01:38,340
kingdoms entirely though
eventually thrown off,

26
00:01:38,341 --> 00:01:41,970
only to be conquered by half
biking group known as the Normans.

27
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:44,820
The English understood
that to protect our nation,

28
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:49,650
they would have to invest in a powerful
navy. As the centuries progressed,

29
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:53,250
that navy saved their country
on multiple occasions,

30
00:01:53,251 --> 00:01:56,490
including during the failed
invasion of the Spanish armada.

31
00:01:56,490 --> 00:02:00,810
During the English Spanish wars and the
battle of Trafalgar and the Napoleonic

32
00:02:00,811 --> 00:02:03,900
wars as Edward Gray would later say,

33
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:08,430
the British army should be a projectile
to be fired by the British navy.

34
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:12,570
The stress that the English began placing
on our navy in the late Middle Ages

35
00:02:12,571 --> 00:02:15,120
and renaissance came at the ideal time.

36
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:20,010
The perspective that Europeans had of
the world was expanding as the Americas,

37
00:02:20,011 --> 00:02:24,540
Africa and Asia were being explored and
the way to get to these places was by

38
00:02:24,541 --> 00:02:28,680
sea. The English had the scramble, the
Ketchup to the Portuguese and Spanish,

39
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:29,760
but when they did,

40
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:34,530
they were active participants of rising
trade exploration and colonialism.

41
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:39,060
Britain was now on the playing field
to dominate the world though rivaled by

42
00:02:39,061 --> 00:02:42,570
other powers like France, Spain,
Portugal, the Netherlands,

43
00:02:42,571 --> 00:02:46,950
and Russia on these new confidence for
centuries to the Europeans advantage,

44
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:50,400
the natives of these regions were
less technologically advanced,

45
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:55,020
lacked unification, and were susceptible
to things like diseases. However,

46
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:58,680
it would be a struggle for Britain
to become top dog in the world.

47
00:02:58,681 --> 00:03:03,490
Empire game in the 18th century though,
controlling much of the Americas, Spain,

48
00:03:03,491 --> 00:03:06,070
and Portugal is power began to decline.

49
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:10,120
The Netherlands were knocked out of the
game significantly in the 17th century

50
00:03:10,210 --> 00:03:11,800
along with Scandinavia.

51
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:16,350
Russia expansion was not fueled by a
strong navy and was therefore a focused

52
00:03:16,351 --> 00:03:19,330
mostly on lands which
were connected to its own.

53
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:24,510
Austria was too burdened by mainland
conflict and Italy and Germany lacked true

54
00:03:24,761 --> 00:03:27,310
unification until the 19th century.

55
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:32,110
This left France as Britain's
main enemy in the 18th century.

56
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:35,710
Britain and France fought it out over
the course of the 18th century and a

57
00:03:35,711 --> 00:03:38,440
series of almost constant
war than conflicts.

58
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:43,080
One of the most important conflicts of
this era and in world history being a

59
00:03:43,081 --> 00:03:45,730
seven years' war in America and Canada,

60
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:50,500
the seven years' war as often downplayed
as merely the French and Indian war,

61
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:53,650
the war between Britain and
the French and a native allies.

62
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:55,660
But it was much more than that.

63
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:59,140
It involved all major
European powers at the time.

64
00:03:59,141 --> 00:04:03,220
It was fought on all continents
except Oceania and Antarctica.

65
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:08,280
And in many ways it was the first real
world war and the site of the future of

66
00:04:08,591 --> 00:04:10,510
North America and South Asia.

67
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:14,800
When Britain secured his presence and
influence of her friends and he's regions

68
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:16,780
following the French and Indian war.
However,

69
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:21,310
Britain took a major setback in the late
18th century when it lost some of its

70
00:04:21,311 --> 00:04:25,000
most important colonies,
the 13 in North America,

71
00:04:25,001 --> 00:04:28,480
which became the United States
after throwing off British rule,

72
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:33,040
an event which was encouraged and
received an important assistance from

73
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:36,850
Britain's arch nemesis, France.
Though this was crippling,

74
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:40,960
Britain bounced back that century as it
retained other important colonies like

75
00:04:40,961 --> 00:04:45,910
Canada and expanded into Australia,
India, and other parts of Asia.

76
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:50,680
All while France struggled to
recoup the for France could recover.

77
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:53,530
Though it underwent a
decade long revolution,

78
00:04:53,531 --> 00:04:57,550
which spilled over into other parts of
Europe and threatened not only British

79
00:04:57,551 --> 00:05:01,660
possessions like Ireland,
but also the British government itself.

80
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:03,340
When the revolution ended,

81
00:05:03,341 --> 00:05:07,510
it did so under the rule of Napoleon
who said about conquering the whole

82
00:05:07,511 --> 00:05:10,480
continent and had a specific
interest in Britain.

83
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:14,230
Though Napoleon's invasion
of Britain failed. As I said,

84
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:18,460
France remained a critical threat on
which Britain focused its resources and

85
00:05:18,461 --> 00:05:21,490
tried to rally the continent
against for over a decade.

86
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:24,580
While in the poem was having great
success on the main continent,

87
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:28,030
he did fail with Francis,
former colonial possessions.

88
00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:33,090
He reclaimed Louisiana only to sell it
to the United States and lost Haiti to a

89
00:05:33,281 --> 00:05:37,600
slave uprising for the more he failed
to challenge Britain and other parts of

90
00:05:37,601 --> 00:05:41,980
the world leaving the path the colonizing
these places open to Britain when

91
00:05:41,981 --> 00:05:43,900
Napoleon was eventually to feed it,

92
00:05:43,901 --> 00:05:48,790
it paid off greatly for
Britain as it entered into
what is called Pax Britannica,

93
00:05:48,910 --> 00:05:51,700
a period of relative
peace among Europeans.

94
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:56,820
In 1812 the empire struck back against
the U s and the war of 1812 though this

95
00:05:57,141 --> 00:05:59,690
ended in a stalemate following this war,

96
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:04,460
Britain made a tactically wise decision
and pursued neutrality and eventually

97
00:06:04,461 --> 00:06:09,461
friendship with the United States allowing
Canada to be essentially unbothered

98
00:06:09,801 --> 00:06:13,370
by American power, which would
begin to grow in the 19th century,

99
00:06:13,371 --> 00:06:16,640
but pose no threat to other
parts of the British empire.

100
00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:20,690
This is not as say that Britain had
an open road to the world empire.

101
00:06:20,691 --> 00:06:24,860
It was becoming France.
Though setback was still in the game.

102
00:06:24,861 --> 00:06:29,120
Germany was on the horizon and would
be a major competitor to Britain.

103
00:06:29,210 --> 00:06:32,540
Britain also had to compete with Russia
and the Middle East and Far East,

104
00:06:32,541 --> 00:06:34,820
and what is known as the great game.

105
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:39,230
Japan and China proved to be industrious
and powerful nations, et Cetera,

106
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:42,080
but by the 19th century,
the British empire,

107
00:06:42,081 --> 00:06:47,000
his position as world power was
established. It ruled Canada, New Zealand,

108
00:06:47,001 --> 00:06:49,550
Australia,
and India relatively safely.

109
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:54,170
The crumbling Ottoman Empire allowed
a route to expand into the fragmented

110
00:06:54,171 --> 00:06:58,430
Middle East and the Conquest of Africa
was shared in an organized by many

111
00:06:58,460 --> 00:06:59,480
European powers.

112
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:04,460
The first great threat to the British
Empire came in the 20th century with World

113
00:07:04,461 --> 00:07:07,730
War One which did in fact
wound Britain greatly,

114
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:12,760
but ultimately led to the expansion of
its empire achieving its apex and 1920

115
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:14,900
not even a century ago,

116
00:07:14,990 --> 00:07:19,280
and controlling one quarter of the
entire planet's land mass and population.

117
00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:22,700
To summarize Britain's
geographical advantage,

118
00:07:22,730 --> 00:07:24,800
it's rule over the whole of its island.

119
00:07:24,801 --> 00:07:27,890
It's emphasis on having the
most powerful navy in the world.

120
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:32,330
It's investment in trade and exploration.
It's dry if to colonize the world.

121
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:34,940
It's victories in wars against contenders,

122
00:07:34,941 --> 00:07:39,260
such as in the seven years war and the
avoidance of issues that other mainland

123
00:07:39,261 --> 00:07:44,180
nations face, such as men and conflicts
allowed it this serious advantage. Also,

124
00:07:44,181 --> 00:07:48,710
keep in mind that science and technology
were embraced in Britain early on.

125
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:52,250
For example, the industrial
revolution began in England.

126
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:55,190
Britain's power fell after
the Second World War,

127
00:07:55,191 --> 00:08:00,020
which damages Europe and cause massive
decolonization and independence movements

128
00:08:00,021 --> 00:08:00,920
across the world,

129
00:08:01,010 --> 00:08:06,010
which led to the official end of the
empire in 1997 but its influence on the

130
00:08:07,191 --> 00:08:12,080
world remains on matched and its legacy
on beaten. For more videos like this,
