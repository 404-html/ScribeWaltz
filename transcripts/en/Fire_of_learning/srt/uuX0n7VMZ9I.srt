00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:00,631
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:00,631 --> 00:00:05,280
This is Justin here of course at fire
of learning and I figured it was time to

3
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:10,020
make a video like this and also well
past time to thank you all for your

4
00:00:10,021 --> 00:00:14,220
contribution to this channel. August
was a big month for fire of learning.

5
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:19,250
We hit 20,000 subscribers and the
history of England documentary reached 1

6
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:22,200
million views.
That is really incredible.

7
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:25,140
I could not have done it
without you guys literally,

8
00:00:25,141 --> 00:00:28,890
but what I mean to say is that I greatly
appreciate you guys and I'm glad that

9
00:00:28,891 --> 00:00:33,891
we've been able to form this community
centered around some pretty cool topics

10
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:34,741
this month.

11
00:00:34,741 --> 00:00:39,570
We've finished the two hour long Ireland
Documentary and I've made 21 other

12
00:00:39,571 --> 00:00:44,571
videos and four other documentary videos
this year so far quite simply my plan

13
00:00:44,701 --> 00:00:48,540
for the rest of the year is
to keep bringing you guys
a content that you're here

14
00:00:48,541 --> 00:00:49,374
to see.

15
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:53,640
One thing you guys have noticed that
I've been doing is consistently making

16
00:00:53,641 --> 00:00:57,120
polls on all kinds of
questions in the community tab.

17
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:01,170
That started as just a way to
get to know you guys better,

18
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:04,980
to know who I'm talking to and also to
get feedback from you guys and it still

19
00:01:04,981 --> 00:01:05,760
is,

20
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:09,810
but at this point I've been thinking of
continuing with these questions and then

21
00:01:09,811 --> 00:01:14,760
doing a kind of fire of learning sense
as video where we compare the results of

22
00:01:14,761 --> 00:01:15,594
all the Poles,

23
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:19,410
probably compare them to the results of
the general population and discuss them.

24
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:22,530
I hope I'm not posting too
many poles to be honest.

25
00:01:22,531 --> 00:01:25,770
I'm not 100% sure how they work
from the viewer's perspective,

26
00:01:25,771 --> 00:01:28,410
the channels I followed
don't do them as often,

27
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:32,190
but I just figured it'd be a
very interesting opportunity.

28
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:33,960
From what I've seen so far.

29
00:01:33,961 --> 00:01:36,840
You guys have a lot of different
perspectives on the world.

30
00:01:36,841 --> 00:01:41,400
You guys probably come from all walks of
life and from many different countries,

31
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:45,570
but what interests me as well is
that you guys are a group of people,

32
00:01:45,571 --> 00:01:49,110
very likely,
smarter than the general population.

33
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:51,140
I'm not trying to kiss
your ass or anything there.

34
00:01:51,141 --> 00:01:55,620
I'm just saying that people who spend
their time getting enjoyment out of

35
00:01:55,621 --> 00:01:59,940
watching educational youtube videos
are probably not dumb people.

36
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:04,350
And so it's an interesting opportunity
I think to be able to pull intelligent

37
00:02:04,351 --> 00:02:09,240
people on these big questions. A big
problem that I'm really not a fan of his,

38
00:02:09,241 --> 00:02:11,880
that I'm limited to five options of pole.

39
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:16,860
I was barely able to do the religion pole
as a result of this, you know, Buddhism,

40
00:02:16,861 --> 00:02:20,730
Hinduism, et Cetera, all fell
under other and you know,

41
00:02:20,731 --> 00:02:25,590
I don't know how I cleanly do a poll on
something like race or ethnicity because

42
00:02:25,591 --> 00:02:28,440
of this, but you know, we'll
work with what we've got.

43
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:32,100
So if you'd like to take part
in the census that I'm doing,

44
00:02:32,101 --> 00:02:36,250
feel free to go to the community
tab on my channel and go vote.

45
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:39,930
And other polls because
they're all still open. Also,

46
00:02:39,931 --> 00:02:42,360
I'm pretty sure these polls are anonymous,

47
00:02:42,361 --> 00:02:46,170
at least I don't know how to view who
votes for what unless you comment.

48
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:48,840
So don't feel like your answers
are being watched, you know,

49
00:02:48,841 --> 00:02:50,310
vote how you truly feel.

50
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:55,860
Speaking of polls and my most recent
one I asked you guys to rate fire of

51
00:02:55,861 --> 00:02:58,410
learning.
The Paul is still ongoing.

52
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:02,260
I'm glad to see that the great majority
of you guys think the channel is at

53
00:03:02,261 --> 00:03:03,550
least four stars,

54
00:03:03,551 --> 00:03:08,020
but 12% see it as three stars
and even a couple of people,

55
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:11,770
two or one star.
As for the three stars.

56
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:15,070
One comment I got was that
I don't post videos enough.

57
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:17,770
He made this comment to be
very constructive criticism,

58
00:03:17,771 --> 00:03:20,860
which I appreciate and I know
many of you feel the same way.

59
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:24,820
I am trying to be more productive with
video making and to get more videos up.

60
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:26,560
I think I am getting faster,

61
00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:31,270
but at the end of the day I am just one
guy and something like the history of

62
00:03:31,271 --> 00:03:35,770
Ireland videos which put together are
two hours long. It takes some time.

63
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:38,170
You know they're really 12 videos,

64
00:03:38,171 --> 00:03:42,790
which are 10 minutes long put together
because of course most of you guys prefer

65
00:03:42,791 --> 00:03:45,730
longer videos and I prefer
longer videos myself actually.

66
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:50,020
So I just want it to respond to that
so that you guys didn't think I was

67
00:03:50,021 --> 00:03:54,670
ignoring your comments and let you guys
know I am working on more production or

68
00:03:54,671 --> 00:03:57,880
being more productive because in
the end that benefits everybody,

69
00:03:57,940 --> 00:04:02,940
but I did want to just say also that the
videos I make do take some time as for

70
00:04:03,101 --> 00:04:07,060
the one or two star voters,
I'm not sure what the route is there.

71
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:10,780
I had one guy who voted one star comments
saying he doesn't even follow the

72
00:04:10,781 --> 00:04:14,800
channel. He's never seen one of my videos,
but the polls show up on his speed,

73
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:18,040
which I don't get. But Hey, if you're
watching this, come check out my stuff.

74
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:20,590
I know obviously some
trolls fall on my channel.

75
00:04:20,650 --> 00:04:23,110
Plenty of them comment
in a fire of learning.

76
00:04:23,111 --> 00:04:27,490
You are a communist and arc is Nazi
trying to indoctrinate the youth with anti

77
00:04:27,491 --> 00:04:31,240
white white supremacist propaganda
and I hate you and your family.

78
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:33,040
I get that kind of thing pretty usually,

79
00:04:33,041 --> 00:04:37,750
but I'm still obliged to view the
responses on the Poles as serious.

80
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:39,880
So whatever your rate,
my channel,

81
00:04:39,910 --> 00:04:44,170
let me know in the comments of this video
what you think I can add or do better.

82
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:46,450
Then go ahead and leave.
And the other questions,

83
00:04:46,451 --> 00:04:49,450
comments or concerns you
guys have in the comments,

84
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:52,840
and I can even just get back to you
guys and the next channel update,

85
00:04:52,841 --> 00:04:55,480
we can do another type
of a Q and a type thing.

86
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:58,270
So thank you all again for
taking part in this channel.

87
00:04:58,450 --> 00:05:00,100
There is much more on the way.
