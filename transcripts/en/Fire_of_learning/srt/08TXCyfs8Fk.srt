00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:01,800
Hello and welcome the fire of learning.

2
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:04,650
We've talked about the
Viking age somewhat in depth,

3
00:00:04,651 --> 00:00:08,250
more in depth I would say than many
channels on youtube seem to go,

4
00:00:08,251 --> 00:00:12,030
but in this video we're going to finish
it off and talk about the end of the

5
00:00:12,031 --> 00:00:12,601
Viking age.

6
00:00:12,601 --> 00:00:17,601
So what caused the end of the Viking age
and what does the end of the Viking age

7
00:00:17,821 --> 00:00:19,620
really refer to?
Well,

8
00:00:19,621 --> 00:00:24,030
many people put the end of the Viking
age in the 11th century. After his time,

9
00:00:24,031 --> 00:00:26,280
a number of things were happening.
Firstly,

10
00:00:26,281 --> 00:00:28,860
Scandinavia was becoming
more politically centralized.

11
00:00:28,861 --> 00:00:33,180
It's here that we really begin to see
the beginnings of the modern Scandinavian

12
00:00:33,181 --> 00:00:34,014
nations.

13
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:38,430
A main source of whacking opportunity
to go rating was the weather class

14
00:00:38,431 --> 00:00:39,330
structure was structured.

15
00:00:39,630 --> 00:00:43,620
It was a greater emphasis on democracy
and really less of an emphasis on having

16
00:00:43,621 --> 00:00:45,570
single unquestionable leaders.

17
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:49,500
There's a story in fact of the Vikings
in France being asked to identify their

18
00:00:49,501 --> 00:00:53,040
leader to which they're applied.
We are all leaders here. Later on,

19
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:56,190
that all changed. The wealthy
elite all moved higher at the top.

20
00:00:56,191 --> 00:00:59,110
The governments became more centralized
and encompass more territory.

21
00:00:59,111 --> 00:01:02,970
In the former Viking homelands began
to resemble other European nations.

22
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,830
Secondly,
the north were becoming Christians.

23
00:01:04,831 --> 00:01:08,880
Remember that life Erickson had been sent
to spread Christianity as far away as

24
00:01:08,881 --> 00:01:11,730
Greenland and therefore the
urge to resist the Christians,

25
00:01:11,731 --> 00:01:16,230
which was believed to be a major cause
for the Viking age itself was less

26
00:01:16,231 --> 00:01:18,240
intense.
In the 10th Century,

27
00:01:18,241 --> 00:01:22,110
Harold Bluetooth convinced a Danish to
convert to Christianity and all off the

28
00:01:22,111 --> 00:01:25,770
first and second of Norway, but brought
Christianity to their nations as well.

29
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:29,700
Story sometimes tell if people
demanding that a trial be conducted,

30
00:01:29,701 --> 00:01:34,560
that pagans would light one fire and
Christians would light another fire and a

31
00:01:34,561 --> 00:01:34,891
buzzer.

32
00:01:34,891 --> 00:01:38,580
Kirra kind of slightly insane Viking
warrior known for working themselves up

33
00:01:38,581 --> 00:01:40,320
into a terrible rage before battle,

34
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:42,720
possibly with the help
of psychedelic mushrooms.

35
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:46,320
What attempt to pass through each fire
in whichever fire he could not pass

36
00:01:46,321 --> 00:01:49,260
through was the one which
belonged to the Sherwood legend.

37
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:51,420
According to legend and one such events,

38
00:01:51,421 --> 00:01:54,690
he passed to the peg and fire with these
but could not pass to the Christians

39
00:01:54,691 --> 00:01:57,360
fire. Many norths were then
convinced of Christianity,

40
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:59,970
civil war emerge and part of Sweden.
Over the religion,

41
00:01:59,971 --> 00:02:02,220
pagans and Christians took
up arms against each other.

42
00:02:02,221 --> 00:02:03,600
Though by the 12th century,

43
00:02:03,601 --> 00:02:07,380
the people of Modern Sweden had accepted
Christianity as well. Furthermore,

44
00:02:07,381 --> 00:02:11,550
if Viking explorations sort of slowed
down at this time to a viking set,

45
00:02:11,551 --> 00:02:14,340
the Faroe Islands and Iceland
and Greenland in North America,

46
00:02:14,341 --> 00:02:18,140
but around a thousand and they got kicked
out of North America and after that in

47
00:02:18,141 --> 00:02:21,990
North America was just a mysterious land
that they had sent lumberjacks to for

48
00:02:21,991 --> 00:02:25,710
what and they stopped colonizing
these distant lands. Oh, very likely.

49
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:29,700
Make a video and the near future of
what might've happened in an alternate

50
00:02:29,701 --> 00:02:32,950
history where the Vikings continued
colonization of American successful

51
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:35,430
successfully,
the colony in Greenland as well,

52
00:02:35,431 --> 00:02:37,710
would eventually fail
over hundreds of years.

53
00:02:37,711 --> 00:02:40,910
Green and lost contact with the
rest of Europe. The climate change,

54
00:02:40,911 --> 00:02:44,760
the growing Calder and hostile native
Americans that throw people also moved

55
00:02:44,761 --> 00:02:45,594
into the region.

56
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:49,050
A variety of factors is a very
likely contributed to the mysterious

57
00:02:49,051 --> 00:02:52,440
disappearance of the north of Greenland.
By the 15th century,

58
00:02:52,441 --> 00:02:54,690
the colonies were likely
entirely abandoned.

59
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:58,980
Europe itself was changing in ways that
made viking raise less feasible as well.

60
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:02,950
European nations like England and France
were becoming more centralized to and

61
00:03:02,951 --> 00:03:06,070
they were beginning to maintain
standing professional armies,

62
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,350
kings of these nations.
Quite simply,

63
00:03:08,351 --> 00:03:12,400
we're tired of the vikings and Delta
fences around formerly vulnerable targets.

64
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:15,610
Viking Raiders who specialize
in shock tag like soon,

65
00:03:15,611 --> 00:03:19,240
found defenses and standing armies in
the way of their treasure making the past

66
00:03:19,241 --> 00:03:21,880
time considerably unappealing.
The Viking Age,

67
00:03:21,881 --> 00:03:24,910
quite obviously it was coming to an end
at the influence of the Norsemen was

68
00:03:24,911 --> 00:03:28,090
fading. However, one
Norseman Harold Hardrada,

69
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:30,580
King of Norway was not
going down without a fight.

70
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:33,310
King Harold to try for some
time to invade Denmark.

71
00:03:33,311 --> 00:03:36,190
Though he eventually signed a
truce agreeing to not invade them.

72
00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:40,210
He then turned his attention
toward England where the
monarchy of the day in law

73
00:03:40,211 --> 00:03:43,540
was in trouble. He claimed the throne
from himself upon the death of Edward,

74
00:03:43,541 --> 00:03:45,970
the confessor the throne.
However, it did not go to him.

75
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:48,040
It went to another Harold King,

76
00:03:48,041 --> 00:03:52,450
Harold Godwinson and Anglo Saxon last
Anglo Saxon too. We have a rural England,

77
00:03:52,451 --> 00:03:54,670
in fact,
Hardrada dreaming of empire,

78
00:03:54,671 --> 00:03:58,300
thus set sail to invade England
and claim the throne for himself.

79
00:03:58,390 --> 00:04:02,620
In the year 10 66 Hardrada invaded.
Though this invasion was a failure.

80
00:04:02,770 --> 00:04:06,580
He had arrogantly assume that England
had belonged to term and that resistance

81
00:04:06,581 --> 00:04:10,270
would soon fall apart and not the battle
of Stamford Bridge for which she was

82
00:04:10,271 --> 00:04:13,480
very unprepared.
He was defeated by an English army.

83
00:04:13,570 --> 00:04:15,730
An arrow struck our drought
as throat killing him,

84
00:04:15,731 --> 00:04:20,500
and subsequently many historians say
ending the Viking Age within the next 200

85
00:04:20,501 --> 00:04:23,200
years of vikings would be kicked
out of Ireland and Scotland as well.

86
00:04:23,201 --> 00:04:26,260
The Normans would assimilate to the
rest of France and Russia would become a

87
00:04:26,261 --> 00:04:30,160
primarily Slovic nation. Liking a
settlement and exploration had ceased.

88
00:04:30,161 --> 00:04:33,400
Their empires had been repelled.
The raids had stops. Their religion,

89
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:37,180
culture and society has had assimilated
largely to the rest of Europe.

90
00:04:37,181 --> 00:04:39,130
The Viking age was over.

91
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:42,670
This is by no means though means
they're influenced or that the north's

92
00:04:42,671 --> 00:04:45,160
themselves had disappeared.
Quite notably,

93
00:04:45,161 --> 00:04:49,190
only three days after Harold had drawn a
died in England. William the conqueror,

94
00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:52,060
King of Normandy, set out to
conquer England. Of course,

95
00:04:52,061 --> 00:04:56,950
remember Normandy was the land that the
king of France gave the Vikings over a

96
00:04:56,950 --> 00:04:57,340
hundred years earlier.

97
00:04:57,340 --> 00:05:00,550
Many people attribute the Norman Conquest
to being a conquest of the French,

98
00:05:00,551 --> 00:05:02,530
but in fact they were French Viking.

99
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:05,890
His invasion was successful and
its affects last to this day,

100
00:05:06,130 --> 00:05:09,730
and that is only one example of how the
north and the Viking age in general help

101
00:05:09,731 --> 00:05:11,050
shaped modern Europe.

102
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:14,800
The Viking societies themselves would
evolve into modern day Denmark, Sweden,

103
00:05:14,801 --> 00:05:15,634
and Norway.

104
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:18,430
They're calling either the well became
the modern nations of Iceland and the

105
00:05:18,431 --> 00:05:21,100
Pharaoh islands. Furthermore,
they linguistically,

106
00:05:21,101 --> 00:05:24,250
culturally and politically
influenced England, France, Russia,

107
00:05:24,251 --> 00:05:27,850
and the Baltic states, as well as
other places as well. So in summary,

108
00:05:27,851 --> 00:05:32,080
it's entirely justifiable to have mixed
feelings regarding the vikings by our

109
00:05:32,081 --> 00:05:36,340
own standards today. They were in some
ways abhorrent and awful. People there.

110
00:05:36,341 --> 00:05:38,500
Infanticide, murder, rape, pillaging,

111
00:05:38,501 --> 00:05:42,010
and general destruction is
justification to hate them really,

112
00:05:42,011 --> 00:05:43,720
and be glad that they
are a thing of the past.

113
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:46,900
But other than Norris around at the time,
who developed a rich,

114
00:05:46,901 --> 00:05:50,950
somewhat democratic culture and society
who set out to build better lives for

115
00:05:50,951 --> 00:05:55,120
themselves and explore new lands and
to impact of the world in many positive

116
00:05:55,121 --> 00:05:59,540
ways are entirely worthy of being
as admirable ancestors of the West.

117
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:03,170
We can look at the men of women who moved
to unforgiving and unknown frontiers

118
00:06:03,171 --> 00:06:05,690
like the Faroe Islands, Iceland,
Greenland in North America,

119
00:06:05,691 --> 00:06:08,170
and perhaps draw inspiration
from them as we are ourselves.

120
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:12,080
Begin to look toward the
unforgiving frontiers of the
solar system, for example.

121
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:14,330
And that's all I have
for the Vikings for now.

122
00:06:14,331 --> 00:06:17,720
For more videos and series of
videos on subjects like history,

be sure to check out fire of
learning and subscribe. Thank you.

125
00:06:22,821 --> 00:06:25,940
Or as a north would say, fuck
of fear. Rare for watching.

126
00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:29,460
Oh, by the way, I forgot
to mention Vikings,

127
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:31,610
then an accident where horns on
their helmets. That's a myth.
