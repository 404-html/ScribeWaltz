Hello and welcome to fire of learning.

2
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:05,160
When we sync of European
colonization of the Americas,

3
00:00:05,161 --> 00:00:09,210
we tend to think of the big nations it
did so the ones which had large lasting

4
00:00:09,211 --> 00:00:13,920
colonies, England, France,
Spain, Portugal, the Dutch,
and even Russia to some extent.

5
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:14,611
However,

6
00:00:14,611 --> 00:00:19,380
we often forget to discuss Sweden and a
discussion when Sweden did in fact whole

7
00:00:19,381 --> 00:00:24,150
colonial territory in North
America territory in fact
that for many Americans is

8
00:00:24,151 --> 00:00:28,470
much closer to home than they realize,
but why? What was it like there?

9
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:31,710
Where did these Swedish colonies go?
And this video,

10
00:00:31,711 --> 00:00:34,350
we're going to answer all those
questions and more as we discussed,

11
00:00:34,351 --> 00:00:36,630
Sweden's colonization
out of North America.

12
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:42,210
The year is 1638 Sweden is in the
middle of the 30 years of war,

13
00:00:42,211 --> 00:00:44,490
but it's only beginning.
It's rain as an empire,

14
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:48,480
an empire forged by the recently
to cease King Gustavus Adolphus.

15
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:52,440
The Swedes don't merely intend to turn
their nation into a regional power.

16
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:55,950
The challenge nearby nations such
as Russia, Denmark, and Poland,

17
00:00:56,400 --> 00:01:00,270
they have goals to challenge the rest of
Europe as well and competes on a global

18
00:01:00,271 --> 00:01:02,070
scale. Was France, England,

19
00:01:02,071 --> 00:01:06,240
and Spain who are busy beginning of
decolonization of distant lands like these

20
00:01:06,241 --> 00:01:10,800
nations. Sweden under Queen Christina
will attempt to colonized North America.

21
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:14,310
The project was first
envisioned 12 years earlier,

22
00:01:14,311 --> 00:01:17,910
mainly by its founder of Flemish
man named villain was links,

23
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:20,760
one of the founders of the Dutch
west India company as well.

24
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:25,350
Villain links was a businessman and a
Protestant and saw an opportunity to

25
00:01:25,351 --> 00:01:28,230
spread both business and
Protestantism and the new world.

26
00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:32,310
Disappointed with the activities
of the Dutch west India company.

27
00:01:32,311 --> 00:01:35,970
He would turn his business interest
to an opportunity he saw in Sweden.

28
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:40,680
He acquired permission from King Gustavos
Adolphus to found a trading company

29
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:42,750
known as a Swedish south company.

30
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:46,950
The main focus of this company would be
trading the resources of the new world,

31
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:51,750
such as primarily for and
tobacco accordingly plants
and set up a colony to do

32
00:01:51,751 --> 00:01:54,810
so.
We're ranged to govern this colony.

33
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:57,090
Ousel links recruited the
help of another Dutchman,

34
00:01:57,220 --> 00:02:00,150
the former governor of the colony
of new Netherland. In fact,

35
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:05,310
patron mean we painter had been replaced
as governor of new Netherland following

36
00:02:05,311 --> 00:02:08,610
a dispute involving illegal first rate.
Accordingly,

37
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:11,790
now jobless and with experience
trading in a new world.

38
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:13,710
He was the perfect man for the job.

39
00:02:14,130 --> 00:02:17,850
In 1637 and expedition of
two shifts was organized.

40
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:22,140
This collaboration between these
individuals and other Dutch businessmen,

41
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:26,060
the Swedish government and businessmen
from places like the holy Roman Empire

42
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:30,000
set off for the new world.
The following year. In March,

43
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:33,990
they landed in an area that is now the
present city of Wilmington, Delaware,

44
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:37,200
considerably south from where
a few centuries earlier,

45
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:39,690
the ancestral relatives of the Swedish,

46
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:44,370
the Icelandic and Greenlandic vikings
had landed when they discovered the new

47
00:02:44,371 --> 00:02:45,204
world.

48
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:49,590
The men surveyed the land and eventually
selected a location along the Delaware

49
00:02:49,591 --> 00:02:50,100
River,

50
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:53,760
which they believed would be easy to
defend from attacks from native Americans

51
00:02:53,761 --> 00:02:56,910
or the Dutch or the English
who had ambiguous claims.

52
00:02:56,910 --> 00:03:01,910
The same area they called the and the
subsequent settlements for Christina after

53
00:03:02,921 --> 00:03:04,390
the reigning monarch at the time.

54
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:09,400
Some of them are always first actions
where the whole negotiations with a nearby

55
00:03:09,401 --> 00:03:11,790
native American tribes,
namely Volvo,

56
00:03:11,791 --> 00:03:15,880
not pay and the Susko Hanuk after
establishing trading agreements,

57
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:19,390
land agreements as well as other
diplomatic terms for these tribes.

58
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:23,410
The Swedish helps secure the position
on the continent and left their main

59
00:03:23,411 --> 00:03:26,370
threat as a Dutch who were
settled in nearby territory.

60
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:29,740
The north mainly in the modern
day state and city of New York.

61
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:32,200
Fortunately for the Swedish or the Dutch,

62
00:03:32,201 --> 00:03:34,780
currently lacks sufficient
manpower for a major battle.

63
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:38,250
Having accomplished many of the
preparations for the call Neiman,

64
00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:41,920
we returned to Sweden to bring a second
load of colonists. This settlement,

65
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:46,690
unfortunately on this
voyage while stopping in the
Caribbean to purchase goods

66
00:03:46,691 --> 00:03:48,970
to bring back to Europe to
help pay for the voyage.

67
00:03:49,210 --> 00:03:53,650
He was caught in a hurricane and
parish there. Five years later,

68
00:03:53,651 --> 00:03:57,160
he was succeeded by a man
named Johan Bjornsen, prince,

69
00:03:57,250 --> 00:04:02,250
a Swedish soldier and mercenary
weighing somewhere around 400 pounds.

70
00:04:02,351 --> 00:04:06,250
The native Americans would refer to
him as big belly. He and the settlers,

71
00:04:06,251 --> 00:04:10,090
he brought over what continued to maintain
amicable relations with the natives

72
00:04:10,091 --> 00:04:10,924
of the area.

73
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:15,460
Prince would establish Fort Naya
Elfsborg and Fortune Naya Guttenberg,

74
00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:19,420
thereby expanding the settlement and
securing a Swedish defenses against a

75
00:04:19,421 --> 00:04:22,150
potential Dutch English
or native invasions,

76
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:26,920
though forced Naya Elfsborg nicknamed
Fort Mosquito was eventually abandoned

77
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:29,710
mainly because of the surplus
number of the bogs in the area.

78
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:33,040
That's a time the defenses
were mainly precautionary.

79
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:36,220
The Swedish were concerned
a potential attack,

80
00:04:36,221 --> 00:04:38,980
but the settlers coming
mainly from Sweden, Finland,

81
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:42,880
and other parts of the Swedish empire
as well as Netherlands, Denmark,

82
00:04:42,881 --> 00:04:47,440
and Germany who would eventually number
around 600 coexisted mostly peacefully

83
00:04:47,441 --> 00:04:51,700
with their native Dutch and English
neighbors at first with time, however,

84
00:04:51,701 --> 00:04:55,450
tensions would strain. The Swedish
would eventually support the Susko.

85
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:59,260
Hancock's in a war against England and
land disputes continued with a Dutch.

86
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:03,970
The settlers of new Sweden were
of a variety of backgrounds.
They were craftsmen,

87
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:06,460
farmers, mercenary soldiers, businessmen,

88
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:10,120
Lutheran ministers who can it to
first Lutheran Church in the Americas,

89
00:05:10,121 --> 00:05:12,730
et cetera. They brought with
them a building technique,

90
00:05:12,731 --> 00:05:16,570
which was common in Finland and
Sweden at the time log cabins.

91
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:19,990
The usefulness of these structures was
quickly adopted by colonists from the

92
00:05:19,991 --> 00:05:24,340
Netherlands and England and other places
as well who are not as familiar with

93
00:05:24,341 --> 00:05:28,900
the structure log cabins of course remain
with us to to stay in varying forms

94
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:32,110
all originating with a
Swedish and Finnish sellers.

95
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:37,120
Prince was an effective leader of new
Sweden and contributed a great deal to its

96
00:05:37,121 --> 00:05:39,730
efficiency and prosperity.
However,

97
00:05:39,731 --> 00:05:44,110
he ruled with what many of the colonists
felt was too much power and to petition

98
00:05:44,111 --> 00:05:45,220
began to replace him,

99
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:50,310
which was successful in 1653 and 1654 he
was replaced by Johan class and rising

100
00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:54,250
one of risings first actions.

101
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:58,740
Upon arriving in new Sweden as governor
was to front the now hostile dush wet

102
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:01,280
erected a fort called
Fort Chasm here nearby.

103
00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:05,400
He took this forward without firing a
single shot as a Dutch lacked any gum

104
00:06:05,401 --> 00:06:07,370
powder with wish to defend themselves.

105
00:06:07,730 --> 00:06:12,560
The Swedish rename the fort to Fort
Trinity fearing a response rising then

106
00:06:12,561 --> 00:06:15,140
ordered the defenses of porkers
sooner to be strengthened.

107
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:20,470
Ricing was correct in his fears and 1655
as the second northern war erupted in

108
00:06:21,171 --> 00:06:24,110
Europe and southern Dutch and
Swedish on opposite sides.

109
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:26,670
The governor of the Dutch colonies haters,

110
00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:31,160
stripe is sont laid siege to for
Christina with seven ships and over 300

111
00:06:31,161 --> 00:06:34,010
soldiers,
outgunned and outnumbered.

112
00:06:34,011 --> 00:06:37,610
The Swedish eventually decided
to surrender for Christina
to the Dutch which the

113
00:06:37,611 --> 00:06:42,200
victors would rename to Fort Altina
with a Swedish military busy defending

114
00:06:42,201 --> 00:06:42,620
Europe.

115
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:47,330
Reinforcements from the homeland were
entirely unlikely and indeed never came.

116
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:50,600
Sweden's colonization
attempts in North America,

117
00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:54,230
though at first prosperous unfortunately
failed within a few decades with the

118
00:06:54,231 --> 00:06:55,520
loss of fork.
Christina,

119
00:06:55,970 --> 00:06:59,300
the Dutch were not exactly cruel
to Swedish settlers that remained.

120
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:03,830
It was demanded that they submit and
become Dutch subjects, but those refused.

121
00:07:03,831 --> 00:07:07,760
We're merely returned to Europe. Those
who stayed were allowed some autonomy.

122
00:07:07,850 --> 00:07:09,560
They were allowed to
form their own militia,

123
00:07:09,561 --> 00:07:13,340
continue trading as they had continued
to practice their religion and speak

124
00:07:13,341 --> 00:07:17,630
their languages. I of course,
mostly Swedish and Finnish
and retain their lands.

125
00:07:18,050 --> 00:07:21,770
Some sellers from the Swedish empire
continued to come to new Sweden. Fact,

126
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:25,550
this subjugated Swedish colony continued
officially until the Dutch colonies

127
00:07:25,551 --> 00:07:30,551
were in turn annex by the English and
in 1681 when William Penn receipt as

128
00:07:30,711 --> 00:07:35,450
charter for Pennsylvania where new Sweden
overlapped, the colonists remained.

129
00:07:35,451 --> 00:07:37,570
They're assimilating and the societies,

130
00:07:37,571 --> 00:07:41,660
I will continue to emerge in the states
of Delaware and New Jersey, New York, etc.

131
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:42,321
However,

132
00:07:42,321 --> 00:07:46,190
very few modern day Americans of Swedish
and Finnish descent artists Senate from

133
00:07:46,191 --> 00:07:47,390
these original colonists.

134
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:51,350
The vast majority came as immigrants to
the United States in the 19th century.

135
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:54,320
Though new Sweden was
not exactly successful,

136
00:07:54,321 --> 00:07:58,130
its foundation and presence
are significant and a
greater story of European

137
00:07:58,131 --> 00:08:03,110
colonization of the Americas. Sweden with
later hold other overseas territories,

138
00:08:03,111 --> 00:08:05,990
even in the Americas,
the Caribbean to be precise,

139
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:09,980
but its hopes to expand its empire
outside its regional boundaries were

140
00:08:09,981 --> 00:08:14,540
unfortunately lost, perhaps primarily
with this story, the support,

141
00:08:14,541 --> 00:08:16,290
the creation of more videos like these,

142
00:08:16,291 --> 00:08:19,190
a link to that channels patriotic
can be found in the description.

143
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,920
For more videos like this and videos
on many other subjects be should have

144
00:08:21,921 --> 00:08:25,550
checked out the rest of fire of learning
and subscribe. Thank you for watching.
