00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:01,800
Hello and welcome to fire of learning.

2
00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:06,300
There are many more ethnicities
and cultures in this
world and there are nation

3
00:00:06,301 --> 00:00:07,134
states.

4
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:12,060
Sometimes nations are the products of
multiple groups coming together and

5
00:00:12,061 --> 00:00:16,830
coexisting. Other Times people don't
fit together so easily in feel.

6
00:00:16,831 --> 00:00:20,650
The creation and protection of their
own nation is imperative to the group

7
00:00:20,651 --> 00:00:21,484
survival.

8
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:26,340
Other times different groups of the same
people split over ideological or social

9
00:00:26,341 --> 00:00:28,440
disagreements.
In this video,

10
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:32,910
we're going to be doing a brief overview
of 25 independence movements on a

11
00:00:32,911 --> 00:00:36,930
continent of Europe alone.
25 countries.

12
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:41,640
That's a huge number y. Well,
looking at the map of Europe,

13
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:46,410
things have not always looked like this.
The Nation States of Europe, as I said,

14
00:00:46,411 --> 00:00:50,310
often contain many different peoples.
In the UK for example,

15
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:54,060
there are five independence Momenta
we'll be discussing in Spain.

16
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:57,270
There are four main ones
and six historic ones. Now,

17
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:01,860
some separatist movements
are only supported by a small
amount of the population,

18
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:06,690
but some have such popular support that
they may soon be coming to a map near

19
00:01:06,691 --> 00:01:08,400
you.
Please keep in mind though,

20
00:01:08,401 --> 00:01:12,510
I will share the opinions
of people regarding the
independence of their regions.

21
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:17,540
These opinions are not necessarily my own
and my personal opinions will as usual

22
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:22,350
be left out of the video. So first
off, let's look at the United Kingdom.

23
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:26,670
Number one Scotland. Scotland is
perhaps the most notable on us,

24
00:01:26,671 --> 00:01:31,290
less because it's the only one among them
that had an indisputable legal vote on

25
00:01:31,291 --> 00:01:35,910
independence. Within recent
times. On September 18th,

26
00:01:35,910 --> 00:01:39,960
2014 Scotland voted on the question of
its independence from the United Kingdom

27
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:44,130
with the voter turnout of
84.5% of the population.

28
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:49,190
55.3% voted no and 44.7% voted yes despite
the poor results for those in support

29
00:01:52,771 --> 00:01:56,790
of independence, the question still may
not be settled because for many Scotts,

30
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:58,350
the issues have not been resolved.

31
00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:02,100
The division between England and
Scotland goes back for centuries.

32
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:07,290
England and Scotland fought for many
years over the Middle Ages until 1603 when

33
00:02:07,291 --> 00:02:12,291
they shared the same monarch and in
1707 legally became a United Kingdom.

34
00:02:12,570 --> 00:02:15,840
Scotland's autonomy has
increased over the past century,

35
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:20,610
but still many Scots are in favor of
independence for cultural reasons such as

36
00:02:20,611 --> 00:02:23,940
the protection of their language
and identity, but economic,

37
00:02:23,941 --> 00:02:26,010
political and social reasons as well,

38
00:02:26,011 --> 00:02:28,590
such as managing Scotland's
natural resources,

39
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:33,450
having an independent Scottish voice on
the global political stage and making

40
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:37,230
other decisions which Scotland
may support, but England does not.

41
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:42,660
Number two whales, another Celtic
nation who's disputes with England,

42
00:02:42,661 --> 00:02:45,240
go back to the foundations
of the two nations.

43
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:49,020
They'll relations between England and
Wales gradually became much smoother than

44
00:02:49,021 --> 00:02:50,580
those between England and Scotland.

45
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:54,540
Talk of independence came back
in the 19th and 20th centuries.

46
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:57,750
The Welsh independence
movement is for the more,

47
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:02,260
not as vocal as Collins when Scotland
McGann calling for independence.

48
00:03:02,261 --> 00:03:07,210
Many Welsh felt that a debate must be held
concerning Welsh independence as well,

49
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:09,460
but they are certainly
not at the same point.

50
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:14,620
Surveys across the country very claiming
anywhere from three to 20% of the

51
00:03:14,621 --> 00:03:16,690
population is in favor of Welsh.

52
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:21,310
Independence support is strongest in
northern Wales where over half the

53
00:03:21,311 --> 00:03:25,960
population may be in favor of it.
Number three Northern Ireland,

54
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:29,830
most northern Irish favor remaining
within the United Kingdom,

55
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:32,620
others with joining the rest of Ireland.
However,

56
00:03:32,621 --> 00:03:37,621
some perhaps up to 15% of the population
are in favor of the creation of an

57
00:03:38,651 --> 00:03:41,830
independent Northern Ireland
or Republic of Ulster.

58
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:46,570
The reason for this is that many Northern
Irish to not feel truly Irish nor

59
00:03:46,571 --> 00:03:51,571
truly British Northern Ireland's origins
lie in the 17th century when the area

60
00:03:52,391 --> 00:03:57,280
was colonized by Protestant English and
Scottish settlers to reduce resistance

61
00:03:57,281 --> 00:03:58,720
to English rural.
Today,

62
00:03:58,721 --> 00:04:02,020
Irish Protestants are still slightly
the majority of the country.

63
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:06,370
The solution to this identity crisis
as well as a number of political and

64
00:04:06,371 --> 00:04:10,690
economic issues and disputes and their
eyes could be an independent ulcer.

65
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:14,290
Number four, Cornwall,
though sometimes forgotten,

66
00:04:14,291 --> 00:04:18,760
the Cornish identity is and has been
distinct from English identity since the

67
00:04:18,761 --> 00:04:20,530
founding of the nation as well.

68
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:25,000
Cornish and English were regarded as
separate for well over a thousand years.

69
00:04:25,001 --> 00:04:27,220
However,
in recent centuries,

70
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:31,750
the decline of the Cornish language has
slightly significantly contributed to

71
00:04:31,751 --> 00:04:34,300
the loss of identity.
The Cornish,

72
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:38,530
much like the Welsh are descended from
the Celtic inhabitants of the island

73
00:04:38,531 --> 00:04:42,010
before Anglo Saxon rule.
They speak a Celtic language,

74
00:04:42,011 --> 00:04:46,480
have Celtic heritage and in their view
have a separate perspective on the world

75
00:04:46,481 --> 00:04:48,610
and their English counterparts.
Accordingly,

76
00:04:48,611 --> 00:04:52,840
over half the population supports
greater autonomy for the region and some

77
00:04:52,841 --> 00:04:54,760
support independence altogether.

78
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,440
Some radicals such as the members of a
Cornish nationalist group known as on

79
00:04:59,441 --> 00:05:04,441
golf may have even been connected to
pro Cornish violence in recent decades.

80
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,630
Number five,
the Isle of Man,

81
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:12,960
the fifth and final independence movement
in the United Kingdom is that of the

82
00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:16,240
Isle of Man, another Celtic
nation predating the Anglo Saxons.

83
00:05:16,930 --> 00:05:21,730
The Manx have existed as a unique
identity for millennia despite having been

84
00:05:21,731 --> 00:05:25,240
ruled by Vikings Scotts
and of course now the UK,

85
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:30,010
a separatist movement known as [inaudible]
or the makes National Party has been

86
00:05:30,011 --> 00:05:34,840
active since the 1960s along with the
goals of protecting them makes language,

87
00:05:34,841 --> 00:05:36,100
culture and identity.

88
00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:40,210
They also believe that
English administration is
negatively affecting the island

89
00:05:40,450 --> 00:05:45,340
and the party's goals are to restore the
island's environment, halt immigration,

90
00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:49,360
build the university,
and make the island more self sufficient.

91
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:52,960
Now to look at France number six Brittany.

92
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:57,590
Brittany is considered the six Celtic
nation after the five which we have just

93
00:05:57,591 --> 00:05:58,424
discussed,

94
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:02,660
but it is located in northwest
France rather than the British isles.

95
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:07,880
Brittany has a Celtic heritage language
and culture is similar to that of Wales

96
00:06:07,881 --> 00:06:10,160
and Cornwall and in fact shares a history.

97
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:15,220
Brittany as a nation existed until 1547
when it was annexed by the Kingdom of

98
00:06:15,411 --> 00:06:19,460
France. Since then, it is
assimilated into French culture,

99
00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:21,860
but within the past century of Britain,

100
00:06:21,861 --> 00:06:25,540
identity has resurfaced and many
Britons are calling for more recognized

101
00:06:25,541 --> 00:06:29,600
identity, greater autonomy, or
even independence from France.

102
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:33,470
Around 18% of the population
supports in the pennants,

103
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:37,730
while 37% consider themselves
Breton's first and French.

104
00:06:37,731 --> 00:06:40,040
Second number seven,
Corsica.

105
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:44,660
Corsica is a Mediterranean island which
has historically switched hands between

106
00:06:44,661 --> 00:06:48,560
multiple nations, even for a time
existing as an independent nation,

107
00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:51,080
but eventually it came into
the hands of the French.

108
00:06:51,081 --> 00:06:55,580
In the 18th century there was resistance
to invasion but eventually acquired

109
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:59,510
many Corsicans have always felt
closer to Italians and French,

110
00:06:59,511 --> 00:07:04,430
but ultimately and independent people
along with threats to the language and

111
00:07:04,431 --> 00:07:04,900
culture.

112
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:08,690
Corsicans have also felt that
their economy has declined
and that they had been

113
00:07:08,691 --> 00:07:12,620
subject to large amounts of immigration
from peoples from the former French

114
00:07:12,621 --> 00:07:16,310
empire, which they don't consent
to in the later 20th century.

115
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:21,110
Economic pressures led to the founding
of militant groups in Corsica and in the

116
00:07:21,111 --> 00:07:24,590
Alaria incident in
August of 1975 of course,

117
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:28,130
it can rebels clash with French forces.
In recent polls,

118
00:07:28,131 --> 00:07:32,040
around 15% of the population
supports complete independence.

119
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:37,120
30% view is independence as a positive
notion and over 50% would prefer more

120
00:07:38,361 --> 00:07:41,900
autonomy from France.
Number eight, all sauce.

121
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:46,640
Another example of a nation in between
nations that is in ways related to both

122
00:07:46,641 --> 00:07:47,960
but not quite either.

123
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:52,820
All sauce rest in between
France and Germany and the
region has been fought over

124
00:07:52,821 --> 00:07:53,601
for centuries,

125
00:07:53,601 --> 00:07:58,430
eventually becoming permanently French
after world war two with their own

126
00:07:58,431 --> 00:08:02,660
language, identity and culture. Many
Alsatians push for greater autonomy.

127
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:04,310
Some for unity with Germany,

128
00:08:04,730 --> 00:08:09,410
but some for independence altogether for
the more all sauce is one of the most

129
00:08:09,411 --> 00:08:13,280
religious and conservative regions in
France and strain with the government

130
00:08:13,281 --> 00:08:16,100
often further encourages
their separate identity.

131
00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:21,020
Number nine Occitania Occitania
covers most of southern France,

132
00:08:21,021 --> 00:08:23,540
but extends into Spain and Italy as well.

133
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:28,400
Oxygen nationalism is rooted in the fact
that accidents have a unique identity,

134
00:08:28,401 --> 00:08:33,230
culture and language as opposed to
French dating back as early as the middle

135
00:08:33,230 --> 00:08:37,130
ages until the regions were subdued
by conquest and interest in oxygen.

136
00:08:37,131 --> 00:08:41,330
Nationalism was brought up in the 1960s
as the French government's economic

137
00:08:41,331 --> 00:08:46,331
reforms took a focus on the north of the
country via autonomy and independence

138
00:08:46,761 --> 00:08:50,600
movements. Last speed during the
1980s button. Recent years even,

139
00:08:50,601 --> 00:08:54,590
there have been a number of protests
and movements focusing on an oxygen and

140
00:08:54,591 --> 00:08:59,520
identity and voice, and now for
Belgium. Number 10 Wallonia.

141
00:09:00,210 --> 00:09:03,420
Ever since Belgium's independence
in the early 19th century,

142
00:09:03,421 --> 00:09:07,020
the people of will loon have asserted
their own identity in the nation.

143
00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:12,690
This identity which emphasizes French
culture and language has led to some alone

144
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:16,920
Ian's to refer a policy of Ritaj
Shazam to rejoin with France.

145
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:21,630
Others, however, see what Clonea as
an independent nation. Historically,

146
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:26,310
the Bologna and movement was closely
linked with socialists activity in Belgium

147
00:09:26,311 --> 00:09:31,210
seeing the nation of Belgium
as a capitalist creation
in recent times harbor,

148
00:09:31,211 --> 00:09:35,310
the dispute has focused more on culture
and identity and a solution to the

149
00:09:35,311 --> 00:09:37,200
complicated politics of dodgem.

150
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:41,520
Number 11 Flenders with the
independence of balloon.

151
00:09:41,521 --> 00:09:45,390
There is also a more culturally and
linguistically Dutch group known as the

152
00:09:45,391 --> 00:09:47,160
Flemish in the north of Belgium.

153
00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:51,660
Belgium was historically
led by francophones and
French language and culture

154
00:09:51,661 --> 00:09:53,640
were favored in the nation.
In fact,

155
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:56,820
Dutch speakers who were skeptical of
independence from the Netherlands and

156
00:09:56,821 --> 00:10:01,170
Flanders sometimes have their houses rated
the solution for some today and we'll

157
00:10:01,171 --> 00:10:05,010
loon and Flinders remains the disillusion
of Belgium between the groups were

158
00:10:05,011 --> 00:10:07,260
more French and were Dutch.
However,

159
00:10:07,261 --> 00:10:11,550
around three quarters of Flanders is
opposed to this solution and now for the

160
00:10:11,551 --> 00:10:15,630
many independence movements of Spain.
Number 12 Catalonia.

161
00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:20,850
Spain was historically the combination
of multiple different peoples and many of

162
00:10:20,851 --> 00:10:23,460
these people's never
quite lost their identity.

163
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:28,260
Catalonia is perhaps the best example
of this as it is one of the most active

164
00:10:28,261 --> 00:10:31,110
independence movements in
Europe and in fact the world.

165
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:36,440
In 2017 though there was a low voter
turnout of only 43% of the population.

166
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:40,530
91% of them voted for
Catalan independence.

167
00:10:40,710 --> 00:10:44,940
Separatist groups have argued that
police oppression of voters led to a low

168
00:10:44,941 --> 00:10:49,860
voter turnout and perhaps as much
as 55% of the region we have voted.

169
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:50,910
However,

170
00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:54,990
anti independence groups believe the
voting process was flawed and that issues

171
00:10:54,991 --> 00:10:58,020
such as the same people
voting twice were present.

172
00:10:58,140 --> 00:11:03,090
Polls show a mix of results and
though 91% of voters voted for Catalan

173
00:11:03,091 --> 00:11:07,710
independence, it's likely that most of
the population is against it. However,

174
00:11:07,711 --> 00:11:11,580
it is very close,
bordering around 50% subsequently,

175
00:11:11,610 --> 00:11:15,630
Catalonia is parliament held a vote for
independence approving the measure on

176
00:11:15,631 --> 00:11:18,480
October 27th,
2017 however,

177
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:22,290
the Spanish government deemed it
illegal and try to prevent anything from

178
00:11:22,291 --> 00:11:26,250
happening from the start and
the international community
does not recognize it.

179
00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:30,870
There are many reasons for us, such a
strong push for Catalan independence.

180
00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:35,130
There are of course, cultural
linguistic and social forces at work.

181
00:11:35,310 --> 00:11:39,390
Catalans have their own language and
identity and history which they feel has

182
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:41,490
been suppressed by the Spanish government.

183
00:11:41,850 --> 00:11:44,430
There are as well major economic forces.

184
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:49,580
Catalonia constitutes only about one
20th of Spain land but holds one fifth of

185
00:11:50,461 --> 00:11:52,830
its economic input.
Furthermore,

186
00:11:52,930 --> 00:11:57,930
20% of Spain's tax revenue comes from
Catalonia leading to a situation where

187
00:11:58,541 --> 00:12:03,541
Catalonia supports the poor regions of
Spain and sees less of its tax revenue

188
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,800
returning to its own region.

189
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:10,990
Obviously Spain is not eager to let its
most profitable region go and most of

190
00:12:10,991 --> 00:12:13,450
Europe sides with a Spanish on the issue.

191
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:18,340
For the moment the decision remains in
question as Catalonians themselves are

192
00:12:18,341 --> 00:12:22,270
about equally divided on what is truly
best for the country. And people.

193
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:25,360
Number 13 the Basque republic.

194
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:29,260
There is a similar situation for
the people of the Basque country,

195
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:32,560
which is in northern Spain
but also extends into France.

196
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:35,950
The Basque people have their own
culture identity language. In fact,

197
00:12:35,951 --> 00:12:38,350
their language is one of the
most unique in the world.

198
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:40,600
It's origins are rather mysterious really,

199
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:44,920
but it is also another economically
prosperous region and Spain and thus the

200
00:12:44,921 --> 00:12:49,570
region economically supports
the poor regions of the
nation as well. As a result,

201
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:53,620
there is a large amount of non Basque
immigration into the region which they

202
00:12:53,621 --> 00:12:54,580
view is threatening.

203
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:59,560
The Basques and the Spanish government
have been in conflict for much of the

204
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:03,010
past hundred years that a dictatorship
of Francisco Franco was especially hard

205
00:13:03,011 --> 00:13:05,440
on them as it was for other
groups in Spain as well.

206
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:10,500
This led to the bass conflict in 1959
with which lasted all the way up to 2011

207
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:15,550
hundreds were killed, thousands
were wounded. The Spanish regard,

208
00:13:15,551 --> 00:13:17,080
the primary group responsible,

209
00:13:17,081 --> 00:13:22,081
the Eta as terrorist and a bass regard
of the Spanish government as oppressors.

210
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:23,350
And thus today,

211
00:13:23,351 --> 00:13:28,351
perhaps around 50% of the
Basque population is in
favor of independence with a

212
00:13:30,370 --> 00:13:33,370
Basque National Party being supported
by around 40% of the population.

213
00:13:34,330 --> 00:13:39,330
Number 14 the Canary Islands
being conquered by the
Spanish and 1402 the islands

214
00:13:40,421 --> 00:13:44,830
have always had a sense of difference.
And Bob, you guessed it, a unique culture,

215
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:46,420
history and identity.

216
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:51,100
The Movement for Canarian independence
became much more supported in a 20th

217
00:13:51,101 --> 00:13:52,300
century and today,

218
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:57,070
43.5% of the population feels
more Canarian in Spanish.

219
00:13:57,071 --> 00:14:02,071
While 49.9% of the population
feels equally Canarian and Spanish,

220
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:07,840
only about 5% of the population said
they felt more Spanish than Canarian.

221
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:09,370
Accordingly,

222
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:13,540
political chaos in the future for Spain
would likely lead to a strong Movement

223
00:14:13,541 --> 00:14:14,590
for independence.

224
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:19,690
Number 15 Galicia north of
Portugal in Northwestern Spain.

225
00:14:19,691 --> 00:14:22,150
On June 27th,

226
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:26,920
1931 the Republic of Galicia declared
itself independent from Spain and maintain

227
00:14:26,921 --> 00:14:31,921
this independence and sell June 28th
where after 27 hours rejoined the nation.

228
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:36,580
Glistens have their own language and the
unique history dating back all the way

229
00:14:36,581 --> 00:14:40,210
to the early Middle Ages as
the Kingdom of glycemia. Today,

230
00:14:40,211 --> 00:14:44,260
there is a push for greater autonomy
and even independence in the region.

231
00:14:44,410 --> 00:14:46,420
Exact figures are unknown,

232
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:51,480
but Galician nationalists candidates
received the round 16% of the vote in a

233
00:14:51,561 --> 00:14:56,561
2009 elections in the region beyond
these main ones and Luzia Castiel Aragon,

234
00:14:57,530 --> 00:14:59,060
Conta Bria Leone,

235
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:04,100
Valencia and Mercia have movements for
both greater autonomy and in the eyes of

236
00:15:04,101 --> 00:15:05,690
some independence.

237
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:09,500
Many of these movements have origins
in their histories in the middle ages,

238
00:15:09,590 --> 00:15:14,480
but became particularly inflamed during
the fascist rural of Francisco Franco

239
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:18,440
and socialists upheaval in
Spain. Accordingly, to this day,

240
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:22,670
many pushing for outright independence
of these regions are associated with

241
00:15:22,671 --> 00:15:26,960
socialist movements.
Number 16 so Louisiana or region,

242
00:15:26,961 --> 00:15:31,961
which has been historically fought over
Sally's yet today is divided between the

243
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,500
Czech Republic, Poland, and Germany.

244
00:15:33,650 --> 00:15:38,650
However many Salesian see themselves as
an independent group and some as none of

245
00:15:38,991 --> 00:15:41,870
the three at all.
Exact numbers are not known,

246
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:46,490
but the movement is not really popular
and local elections for candidates who

247
00:15:46,491 --> 00:15:48,110
support even greater autonomy,

248
00:15:48,111 --> 00:15:52,010
typically only amount to about
three to 10% of the popular vote.

249
00:15:52,130 --> 00:15:56,600
The region is also tied
with a less popular Moravian
independence movement also

250
00:15:56,601 --> 00:15:57,440
in the Czech Republic,

251
00:15:57,560 --> 00:16:02,120
which would leave Bohemia as the
remaining check land leading to a complete

252
00:16:02,121 --> 00:16:05,480
breakup of the nation.
Number 17 foreign home,

253
00:16:06,050 --> 00:16:10,250
a small island in the Baltic Sea belonging
to Denmark that people have borne

254
00:16:10,251 --> 00:16:12,290
home with a unique history,
culture,

255
00:16:12,291 --> 00:16:16,580
and language similar to Danish began to
consider independence from Denmark in

256
00:16:16,581 --> 00:16:20,090
the 20th century following
economic and demographic issues.

257
00:16:20,570 --> 00:16:25,570
Foreign home self government party says
it takes inspiration from Scotland and

258
00:16:25,701 --> 00:16:30,590
points to Malta in Singapore as models
for his own independent existence.

259
00:16:30,770 --> 00:16:33,350
Number 18 the Faroe Islands.

260
00:16:34,070 --> 00:16:38,480
The Faroe Islands originally settled
by Vikings in the Middle Ages are still

261
00:16:38,481 --> 00:16:42,770
owned by Denmark as they have been for
most of the past millennia with their own

262
00:16:42,771 --> 00:16:46,400
language, identity, culture and such.
They do not feel Danish. However,

263
00:16:46,430 --> 00:16:51,070
but rather see themselves as a unique
Norse group and push to be a separatist

264
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:55,340
nation. The islands did declare themselves
independent following World War II,

265
00:16:55,430 --> 00:16:58,310
but Denmark declared it illegal.
Nevertheless,

266
00:16:58,311 --> 00:17:02,090
the island's inhabitants still believe
in the cause of independence and feud

267
00:17:02,091 --> 00:17:04,760
with Denmark over the issue.
However,

268
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:09,770
economic concerns have worry the island's
inhabitants about what's self may do

269
00:17:09,771 --> 00:17:12,860
to them.
Number 19 the Olin islands,

270
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:17,780
the island islands off the
coast of Finland, Ra, primarily
Swedish speaking group,

271
00:17:18,110 --> 00:17:19,310
the political party.

272
00:17:19,311 --> 00:17:24,230
The future of Olin has sought independence
from Finland since 2003 with around

273
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:26,690
8% of the population
supporting the measure.

274
00:17:26,810 --> 00:17:31,010
Very few support reunification was Sweden
because of historical disagreements

275
00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:33,530
leading some to prefer independence.

276
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:37,850
Number 20 Bavaria before
Germany was a United nation,

277
00:17:37,851 --> 00:17:42,200
it consisted of many different German
kingdoms. Among these was Bavaria,

278
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:43,273
Bavaria.

279
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:48,320
Traditionally a Catholic nation had much
more in common with Austria than it did

280
00:17:48,321 --> 00:17:50,910
with the Protestant who
were unifying Germany.

281
00:17:51,630 --> 00:17:53,790
Attempts were made to become independent,

282
00:17:53,850 --> 00:17:56,550
especially during and after
World War One and two,

283
00:17:56,670 --> 00:17:58,560
but these were largely unsuccessful.

284
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:01,770
Support for independence
declined over the decades,

285
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:06,720
but with volatile European politics in
independent Bavaria may be a favorable

286
00:18:06,721 --> 00:18:11,310
option for the inhabitants in the
future and now for Italy, Italy,

287
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:16,290
like Germany is a more recent creation
for most of the past thousand years in

288
00:18:16,291 --> 00:18:19,560
nation we call Italy was made
up of several different nations,

289
00:18:19,561 --> 00:18:24,420
kingdoms and city states. Some of them
have accepted in Italian identity,

290
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:27,540
but others hold on to their
unique identities of the past.

291
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:32,840
Number 21 the Republic of Venice Veneto
with a capitol city of Venice along with

292
00:18:34,261 --> 00:18:34,860
Scotland,

293
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:39,300
Catalonia and Abass is one of the more
major independence movements of Europe.

294
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:44,250
Venice as a nation existed for around
the thousand years before the unification

295
00:18:44,251 --> 00:18:48,150
with Italy and accordingly they
have their own culture, identity,

296
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:49,620
language and history.

297
00:18:49,770 --> 00:18:54,770
Perhaps up to 55% of the
population supports independence
and over 60% supports

298
00:18:56,581 --> 00:18:57,960
at least greater autonomy.

299
00:18:58,110 --> 00:19:01,710
After a number of protests
and unofficial referendums,

300
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:06,420
there were demands that an official
referendum be held and that the EU support

301
00:19:06,421 --> 00:19:06,840
it.

302
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:11,840
In October of 2017 Venetians
held a referendum on the
question of whether or not

303
00:19:12,061 --> 00:19:12,590
Venice,

304
00:19:12,590 --> 00:19:17,590
it should have more autonomy and with
half the country voting a little over 90%

305
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:18,900
voted yes.

306
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:24,020
There have even been attempts
or suggestions of violence
such as in 2015 when a

307
00:19:24,301 --> 00:19:28,020
group of nations were caught trying
to turn a tractor into a tank,

308
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:33,140
along with the socio cultural divides
and Benito economic issues are also a key

309
00:19:33,421 --> 00:19:34,230
factor.

310
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:38,580
Venice generates a large amount of income
from trade and tourism such things,

311
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:42,870
but that money is used to fund the
poorer parts of Italy and not Venice.

312
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:47,280
A similar situation as was discussed
in Catalonia and the Basque region.

313
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:52,760
Number 20 to Sardinia with Corsica to
the north having its own independence

314
00:19:52,981 --> 00:19:56,550
moment. Sardinia in the south
also has one of its own,

315
00:19:56,551 --> 00:20:01,350
perhaps an even more popular one because
of Sardinia is unique history, culture,

316
00:20:01,351 --> 00:20:05,520
and many languages as well as the
concern of protecting island environment.

317
00:20:05,730 --> 00:20:10,730
45% of Sardinians reportedly
favor independence from
Italy and 40% prefer more

318
00:20:12,241 --> 00:20:13,290
island autonomy.

319
00:20:13,470 --> 00:20:17,730
According to polls around the quarter
of the island already claims the have no

320
00:20:17,731 --> 00:20:22,731
loyalty to Italy and an additional 37%
claims to be more Sardinian than Italian.

321
00:20:24,270 --> 00:20:28,410
While this may seem like Sardinia
should be among the other more active

322
00:20:28,411 --> 00:20:29,580
independence movements,

323
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:33,570
the independence groups are fragmented
and divided among the islands,

324
00:20:33,571 --> 00:20:37,470
various groups and interests.
Number 23 Cecily,

325
00:20:38,010 --> 00:20:43,010
Cecily having been conquered and
ruled by a variety of nations over the

326
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:48,010
centuries and existing for a time as an
independent nation may want to return to

327
00:20:48,011 --> 00:20:51,970
that status while not receiving a large
amount of support in the election.

328
00:20:51,971 --> 00:20:56,971
Some polls indicate that 44% of Sicilians
find the concept of more autonomy or

329
00:20:57,761 --> 00:21:01,420
even independence favorable.
Though information is limited,

330
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:05,290
the movements are also fragmented
as independence is favored by balls,

331
00:21:05,291 --> 00:21:07,300
right wing and left wing groups.

332
00:21:07,390 --> 00:21:11,710
If theoretically these Italian
independence movements were successful,

333
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:15,730
it could cause further fragmentation
and trigger a fragmentation of Italy

334
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:16,570
altogether,

335
00:21:16,570 --> 00:21:21,160
particularly in regions seeking greater
autonomy even if not much independence

336
00:21:21,161 --> 00:21:25,210
as of today, such as
Lombardi. Liguria and Friuli.

337
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:26,890
Alternatively,
however,

338
00:21:27,130 --> 00:21:31,570
these regions may not break
off individually but may
come together to form the

339
00:21:31,571 --> 00:21:33,010
nation of academia.

340
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:38,820
The day would be an Italian
nation consisting of the
northern provinces such as

341
00:21:38,981 --> 00:21:40,750
Lombardi,
Benito and Piedmont.

342
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:45,100
Northern Italy is economically more
prosperous in the south and northern

343
00:21:45,101 --> 00:21:48,580
Italians feel as though the southern
regions drag the nation behind.

344
00:21:48,670 --> 00:21:49,720
According to polls,

345
00:21:49,721 --> 00:21:54,721
58% of Italians with support such a thing
and in some regions results are much

346
00:21:54,971 --> 00:21:59,971
higher up to 80% the number
24 Transnistria Transnistria
is unique and that it

347
00:22:01,721 --> 00:22:06,040
is one of a few on this list actually
currently functioning as an independent

348
00:22:06,041 --> 00:22:09,280
nation.
Following the collapse of the USSR,

349
00:22:09,310 --> 00:22:12,670
Transnistria engaged in
conflict with Moldova,

350
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:15,250
a cease fire was declared
a few months later,

351
00:22:15,251 --> 00:22:20,200
but the situation remains unresolved with
Moldova is still claiming the land in

352
00:22:20,201 --> 00:22:25,201
2006 97% of the voting population of the
small area of voted for independence,

353
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:29,980
but few countries actually recognize it.
In fact,

354
00:22:29,981 --> 00:22:33,790
the only ones which do are other
countries with disputed independence.

355
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:36,520
Number 25 northern Cyprus.

356
00:22:36,790 --> 00:22:41,790
The divide on this tiny island came in
1983 after a coup d'etat and tending to

357
00:22:42,491 --> 00:22:45,850
join the country with
Greece in 1974 failed.

358
00:22:45,910 --> 00:22:49,510
This prompted Turkey to invade
the island and to this day,

359
00:22:49,511 --> 00:22:53,770
northern Cyprus is heavily dependent
on Turkey support economically,

360
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:58,060
militarily and politically.
The North is heavily ethnically Turkish,

361
00:22:58,090 --> 00:23:02,500
culturally Turkish and speaks Turkish
as opposed to the south which is

362
00:23:02,501 --> 00:23:05,830
ethnically, culturally and
linguistically. More Greek.

363
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:09,850
Turkey is the only nation to
recognize its independence. However,

364
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:14,830
the area does essentially function
independently. Now then to summarize,

365
00:23:14,950 --> 00:23:18,910
there are many movements for greater
autonomy in Europe and obviously these are

366
00:23:18,911 --> 00:23:21,820
some which have evolved into
moments for independence.

367
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:25,990
The 25 we've discussed are
the most notable among them.

368
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:31,080
Over 10% of the population favors
independence and these regions marked with

369
00:23:31,241 --> 00:23:36,220
purple over 40% favors it in the
orange regions and the pink regions.

370
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:40,420
Independence has been declared in
some forums and in the red regions.

371
00:23:40,421 --> 00:23:44,800
The area essentially functions
independently and the
regions containing a star

372
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:49,610
violence has occurred at some point in
the past over the issue. As you can see,

373
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:54,500
the UK, Spain, and Italy are not
only facing independence movements,

374
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:55,430
but in fact,

375
00:23:55,431 --> 00:23:59,840
success of such independence movements
could lead to a fracturing of the nations

376
00:23:59,841 --> 00:24:04,320
into many smaller ones. As European
politics change over the next decade,

377
00:24:04,321 --> 00:24:07,730
some of these movements will,
whether others may intensify,

378
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:11,570
some maybe come fully independent nations.
Ultimately,

379
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:15,980
the decision of whether or not to become
independent and whether or not that

380
00:24:15,981 --> 00:24:20,660
choice is the right or the wrong one.
Rest in the population of these regions.

381
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:23,420
