00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:01,890
Hello and welcome to fire learning.

2
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:06,660
Thomas Jefferson was one of the founding
fathers of the United States of America.

3
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:09,150
He authored the declaration
of independence,

4
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:13,200
served as America's second vice
president and it's third president.

5
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:17,430
Aside from his political roles, he was
also a man of science and philosophy,

6
00:00:17,431 --> 00:00:22,431
being curious of the entire world around
him in his very long an eventful life.

7
00:00:22,441 --> 00:00:26,940
He left us with quite a bit of advice on
both a personal and national level and

8
00:00:26,941 --> 00:00:30,600
in this video we're going to share
that advice. Keep in minds, however,

9
00:00:30,601 --> 00:00:31,920
these are Jefferson's quotes,

10
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:35,670
not necessarily ones which I
personally agree or disagree with,

11
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:36,960
so let's get to it.

12
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:42,270
Number 10 the most valuable of all talents
is that of never using two words when

13
00:00:42,271 --> 00:00:45,870
one will do.
Jefferson had quite a bit to say,

14
00:00:45,871 --> 00:00:50,871
but he was remembered for being a quieter
man in his many years of politics.

15
00:00:50,970 --> 00:00:55,260
He encountered a lot of bloviating and
useless talk and he had no interest in it.

16
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:57,690
When he spoke or when he wrote,

17
00:00:57,691 --> 00:01:00,720
he was very much the points and
a declaration of independence.

18
00:01:00,721 --> 00:01:03,840
Where she authored is a document
that perfectly portrays this.

19
00:01:04,130 --> 00:01:06,900
It is very much to the point number nine,

20
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:11,040
history in general only informs
us of what bad government is.

21
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:15,180
The United States was a nation which
did not only go to war to become an

22
00:01:15,181 --> 00:01:18,270
independent nation.
It's war of independence was also,

23
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:20,610
and probably more importantly
to most Americans,

24
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:25,260
a war fought to embrace new ideals
that were less common in Europe,

25
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:30,120
which was primarily ruled by monarchies
or in England, a constitutional monarchy,

26
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:34,820
plain and simple. Thomas Jefferson
did not like government and in fact,

27
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:38,220
majority of founding fathers shared his
opinion that government should be as

28
00:01:38,221 --> 00:01:42,390
limited as possible because it and
their view typically worked against his

29
00:01:42,391 --> 00:01:43,920
subjects or constituents.

30
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:47,970
The founding fathers disagreed
on where that line was exactly,

31
00:01:47,971 --> 00:01:52,920
but Thomas Jefferson is indeed on the far
end of the bunch in terms of disliking

32
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:54,810
government.
And number eight,

33
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:59,640
timid men prefer the calm of despotism
to the tempestuous sea of liberty.

34
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:03,390
Jefferson did not believe that once
the war of independence was over,

35
00:02:03,391 --> 00:02:05,550
that freedom would be
an easy road from there.

36
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:10,230
Americans today have a proverb that is
similar to this. Freedom is not free,

37
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,920
but most Americans do not understand this
to the extent that Jefferson did as he

38
00:02:13,921 --> 00:02:17,550
had lived in a time when that freedom
was not guaranteed and was hard one

39
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:18,420
liberty,

40
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:22,230
he believed with something that must be
guarded from accrual and wild world on

41
00:02:22,231 --> 00:02:23,760
all sides by individuals,

42
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:26,790
not something that has rewarded
after a single struggle.

43
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:30,810
Only strong people that were willing
to constantly defend their freedom.

44
00:02:30,811 --> 00:02:34,050
We're going to keep it.
He believed. Number seven,

45
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:38,220
I sincerely believe that
banking establishments are
more dangerous than standing

46
00:02:38,221 --> 00:02:42,030
armies and that the principle of spending
money to be paid by posterity under

47
00:02:42,031 --> 00:02:45,570
the name of funding is but swindling
a futurity on a large scale.

48
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:50,010
Jefferson is essentially saying that
working yourself into debt with the

49
00:02:50,011 --> 00:02:54,390
expectation that a future generation will
pay it off is a very bad idea and that

50
00:02:54,391 --> 00:02:57,330
banks pose a greater threat
to nations than army to do.

51
00:02:58,230 --> 00:03:00,820
Jefferson believes that the
habits of European nations,

52
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:04,750
including those that economics,
we're not necessarily models be followed.

53
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:07,600
Jefferson argued against
things like a national bank,

54
00:03:07,601 --> 00:03:11,290
and in fact even claim that
each generation should be
expected to pay off their

55
00:03:11,291 --> 00:03:16,291
debts within 19 years worth pondering
and modern America's economic situation.

56
00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:20,770
Number six determined never to be idle.

57
00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:23,950
No person will have occasion to
complain of the want of time,

58
00:03:23,951 --> 00:03:27,970
who never loses any. It has wonderful how
much maybe done if we're always doing.

59
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:32,650
Jefferson did a lot in his life and he
wouldn't have gotten so much done if he

60
00:03:32,651 --> 00:03:34,660
was not a productive and efficient man.

61
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:38,680
Jefferson believes that a good cure to
feeling like you never have the time to

62
00:03:38,681 --> 00:03:42,640
do the things that you want to do is
to make use of all your time and never

63
00:03:42,641 --> 00:03:46,990
waste any. If you want something done,
get to doing it as simple as that.

64
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:48,123
Number five,

65
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:52,840
if a nation expects to be ignorant
and free in a state of civilization,

66
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:57,700
it expects what never was and never
will be. Jefferson, and in fact,

67
00:03:57,701 --> 00:04:00,730
many of the founding fathers
openly spoke about their opinion,

68
00:04:00,731 --> 00:04:05,170
but a people's wellbeing was inescapably
tied to the level of education and

69
00:04:05,171 --> 00:04:05,950
intelligence.

70
00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:10,000
He believe that freedom of speech opened
the doors for things like education and

71
00:04:10,001 --> 00:04:12,790
ideas and such things to flow
more freely on their own.

72
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:14,780
But he believed furthermore that,
uh,

73
00:04:14,781 --> 00:04:18,730
people should make an effort to better
themselves with an education as a means

74
00:04:18,731 --> 00:04:22,270
to safeguard their freedom and longevity.
Number four,

75
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:26,530
I never considered a difference of
opinion and politics and religion and

76
00:04:26,531 --> 00:04:29,320
philosophy as a cause for
withdrawing from a friend.

77
00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:34,060
Jefferson had very strong political views
and he regularly encounter people with

78
00:04:34,061 --> 00:04:35,590
whom you strongly disagreed.

79
00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:39,550
He helped fight a war over a political
disagreement and yet still in his

80
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:43,000
personal life, other people's
politics, religion or philosophy.

81
00:04:43,001 --> 00:04:46,900
We're not necessarily what constituted
a good person or friend and Jefferson's

82
00:04:46,901 --> 00:04:49,900
eyes.
Sometimes people just think differently.

83
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:53,920
And Jefferson had the ability
to respect that. Number three,

84
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:57,470
do not bite at the bait of pleasure
until you know that there was no hook.

85
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:58,333
And he said,

86
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:03,130
this is Jefferson's advice for an aspect
of the human condition that we are all

87
00:05:03,131 --> 00:05:04,870
sometimes guilty of a,

88
00:05:04,871 --> 00:05:08,230
we do things in the moment that feel
good that we'll have longterm negative

89
00:05:08,231 --> 00:05:12,100
consequences and be when
someone promises us good.

90
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:16,330
We may at times over look the potential
bad and it is the latter part of the

91
00:05:16,331 --> 00:05:21,331
Jefferson focuses on more specifically
a king may promise us prosperity and

92
00:05:21,401 --> 00:05:23,440
wealth for our generation.
However,

93
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:28,500
establishing a monarchy in long run may
in Jefferson's opinion be detrimental

94
00:05:28,511 --> 00:05:32,350
for generations to come that do
not share in that prosperity.

95
00:05:32,890 --> 00:05:33,723
Number two,

96
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,170
I hold it that a little rebellion now
and then is a good thing and as necessary

97
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:42,190
in the political world as storms and
the physical Jefferson does not like the

98
00:05:42,191 --> 00:05:46,420
concept of a system which maintains an
indefinite prosperity because he doesn't

99
00:05:46,421 --> 00:05:47,620
think it's realistic.

100
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:51,310
He believes that the political arena has
to be shaken up quite a bit regularly

101
00:05:51,311 --> 00:05:54,640
in order for freedom to be maintained
as it's just another part of life.

102
00:05:55,570 --> 00:05:58,880
He even somewhat hinted the notion
that the American government,

103
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:03,380
which he helped found would in time change
in forum and begin to encroach on its

104
00:06:03,381 --> 00:06:04,214
citizens,

105
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:08,840
and Jefferson suggested a
regular revolution would
keep this inevitable attempt

106
00:06:08,841 --> 00:06:13,730
on people's freedoms and check number one,
do you want to know who you are?

107
00:06:14,090 --> 00:06:17,900
Don't ask.
Act Action will delineate and define you.

108
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:22,070
We all of course wonder what it means
to be who we are in many different ways.

109
00:06:22,071 --> 00:06:25,610
But Jefferson says that our self is
not something that we searched for and

110
00:06:25,611 --> 00:06:28,970
eventually find,
but rather something which we create.

111
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:33,440
Oftentimes we may be looking for a path
in life when the best path is the one

112
00:06:33,441 --> 00:06:37,340
that we have to build ourselves and
the paths that we ourselves build and

113
00:06:37,341 --> 00:06:41,240
Jefferson's eyes to find us as
individuals. Jefferson, of course,

114
00:06:41,241 --> 00:06:43,640
despite being a quiet man,
had much more to say,

115
00:06:43,641 --> 00:06:47,600
but these are some of his most profound
and celebrated quotes from what we do is

116
00:06:47,601 --> 00:06:49,130
like this and videos
on many other subjects.
