Hello and welcome to fire learning.

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:05,280
Often when we talk about the
evolution of our animal companions,

3
00:00:05,281 --> 00:00:08,370
we focused on the gradual
transition from wolves to dogs,

4
00:00:08,371 --> 00:00:10,860
but how about our feline friends?
Well,

5
00:00:10,861 --> 00:00:13,560
in this video we're going
to explore how cats evolved.

6
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:17,400
The line that led the cats broke off
from the line that led to other failings

7
00:00:17,401 --> 00:00:21,510
such as lions and tigers, only about
10 million years ago, much later,

8
00:00:21,511 --> 00:00:25,970
cats probably quite simply evolved from
the African wild cats Faley Sylvestri

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,560
sleeve.
It costs about 10,000 years ago,

10
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:31,380
which looks much more like a
modern cat than a wolf does.

11
00:00:31,381 --> 00:00:35,280
The average modern dog and
in fact actually exhibits
much more similar behavior

12
00:00:35,281 --> 00:00:37,680
to modern domestic cats
and dogs and wolves.

13
00:00:37,681 --> 00:00:41,520
Do and we'll get to that in a second
though we can still obviously easily

14
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:45,900
contrasted to though humans did in fact
a medicaid other cat like animals and

15
00:00:45,901 --> 00:00:47,010
other parts of the world.

16
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:50,850
Genetic studies have shown that all
domestic cats around today are descended

17
00:00:50,851 --> 00:00:54,750
from the aforementioned African wild
cat with whom they share the closest DNA

18
00:00:54,751 --> 00:00:57,960
match. Now, the date of 8,000 BC,

19
00:00:57,961 --> 00:01:01,740
10,000 years ago is important and it
can be contrasted with dogs who were

20
00:01:01,741 --> 00:01:03,630
domesticated a few thousand years earlier.

21
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:08,160
Dogs were used by our ancestors primarily
for hunting and protection and things

22
00:01:08,161 --> 00:01:08,700
like that,

23
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:13,140
but the evolution of the cad coincides
directly in the same time as and in the

24
00:01:13,141 --> 00:01:17,640
same place as the origin of farming
10,000 years ago in the Middle East.

25
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:19,830
That's a real likely,
not a coincidence.

26
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:23,310
Cats were very likely not
used for plowing fields,

27
00:01:23,311 --> 00:01:26,550
but they almost certainly were involved
in the food production process or more

28
00:01:26,551 --> 00:01:30,900
specifically food preservation process.
How well rodents,

29
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:35,130
the food produced by humans at this time
was of course at risk from infestation

30
00:01:35,131 --> 00:01:38,520
by rodents and rather than have the humans
take care of the problem themselves,

31
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:41,340
they probably simply adopted
the cat to do its job.

32
00:01:41,730 --> 00:01:43,290
Gradually friendlier and friendlier.

33
00:01:43,291 --> 00:01:45,420
Cats were more open to
interaction with humans.

34
00:01:45,421 --> 00:01:49,320
The humans dust domesticated them and
we entered into a fair mutual exchange

35
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:53,250
card, our food, which attracts mice
and you can keep all the mice you find.

36
00:01:53,470 --> 00:01:53,730
However,

37
00:01:53,730 --> 00:01:58,140
the steel wasn't probably so solidified
in pursuit of a process as it was with

38
00:01:58,141 --> 00:02:02,490
dogs cause aren't quite as social as
dark because I don't interact with us in

39
00:02:02,491 --> 00:02:06,720
the same way and they don't follow our
commands as well as any cat owner would

40
00:02:06,721 --> 00:02:10,680
tell you. What happened with cats
was probably more so a coincidence,

41
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:14,940
more like biological mutualism, then
specific directed artificial selection.

42
00:02:14,941 --> 00:02:18,600
Some would even say that if humans were
looking to control the rodent population

43
00:02:18,601 --> 00:02:21,720
there would have been better animals at
a time to domesticate and utilize it in

44
00:02:21,721 --> 00:02:22,380
the cat.

45
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:26,160
The very first evidence we have of cat
domestication comes from the island of

46
00:02:26,161 --> 00:02:28,710
Cyprus around 9,500 years ago.

47
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:32,520
The year 7,500 BC alongside human remains.

48
00:02:32,521 --> 00:02:34,110
Presumably the former owners,

49
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:37,800
this location and men are variable are
both important and providing evidence

50
00:02:37,801 --> 00:02:41,700
that this was indeed the time in
which cats were domesticated as a,

51
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:45,240
there were no cast native to the island
to begin with and seeing as how cats are

52
00:02:45,241 --> 00:02:46,980
stereotypically not fond of swimming,

53
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:49,740
someone would've had to have
brought them there and be one,

54
00:02:49,741 --> 00:02:52,530
would very likely not bury
themselves with a wild animal,

55
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:54,870
especially one is trivial as a wild cat.

56
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:58,050
So assuredly by this time humans and cats,
we're living together.

57
00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:02,440
Cats played the in modern human
civilization as well. In ancient Egypt,

58
00:03:02,441 --> 00:03:05,770
the charge for killing a cat, it was
often the same as killing another person,

59
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,030
which was often death.

60
00:03:07,210 --> 00:03:10,390
This was due to the CAS importance
in Egypt and religious practice.

61
00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:13,810
The Romans helps spread cats across
Europe where they were valued as an

62
00:03:13,811 --> 00:03:18,490
independent pet and seen as a symbol of
individual liberty actually and during

63
00:03:18,491 --> 00:03:21,850
this time cast spread at the Far
East as well. In the Middle Ages,

64
00:03:21,851 --> 00:03:24,670
cats were seen as a symbol
of bad luck and they,

65
00:03:24,671 --> 00:03:28,660
especially black hats were warded off
and sometimes killed go naturally.

66
00:03:28,661 --> 00:03:32,110
They going to come back and today there
are an estimated 600 million domestic

67
00:03:32,111 --> 00:03:33,190
has around the world.

68
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:36,070
So that's how the domestic cat
evolved into its current form.

69
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:39,460
If you're interested in hearing how any
other animals evolved and Mesic or not,

70
00:03:39,461 --> 00:03:41,980
let me know in the comments section
below and I may do a video on it.

71
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:44,560
And more videos like these and
videos on many other subjects.

72
00:03:44,561 --> 00:03:46,720
We should have checked out
five of learning and subscribe.

73
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:48,040
Thank you for watching.
