00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:04,860
Hello and welcome to fire of
learning England and France.

2
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:08,580
Today the two nations get along
comparatively pretty well.

3
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:11,130
Not always eye to eye on everything,

4
00:00:11,131 --> 00:00:14,460
but you could definitely
say their overall friends.

5
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:17,520
This was not always the case.

6
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:21,870
This friendship comes after
over 800 years of animosity,

7
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:26,700
certainly not always at war in that time,
but from the Middle Ages to Napoleon,

8
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:31,500
England and France always had an eye on
each other and we're rarely afraid to

9
00:00:31,501 --> 00:00:33,870
settle their grievances
the old fashioned way.

10
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:38,460
What was the reason for this
bitter endless rivalry? Well,

11
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:42,210
we can consider a number of factors.
Religion played a role for awhile.

12
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:47,250
Later on after the Protestant reformation
spread across Europe and the 15

13
00:00:47,251 --> 00:00:51,360
hundreds Catholics and Protestants
overall developed hard feelings for each

14
00:00:51,361 --> 00:00:54,240
other,
which often led to brutal conflicts,

15
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:59,130
conflicts from which France emerged for
many Catholic and England Protestant,

16
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:03,540
the two nations also deferred politically
and philosophically from time to time.

17
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:06,960
And when one nation was shaken up,
the other felt the effects.

18
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:11,700
The most obvious example of this being
the widespread effects of the French

19
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:13,620
revolution,
which England attempted to counter.

20
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:17,940
And of course when about any two groups
of people find themselves right next to

21
00:01:17,941 --> 00:01:20,970
each other geographically,
they tend to compete for land,

22
00:01:20,971 --> 00:01:23,880
power and resources
through war and conflict.

23
00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:26,100
England and France are no exception,

24
00:01:26,370 --> 00:01:30,000
but we can find examples of all
of these things across the globe.

25
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:34,950
What makes the rivalry between England
and France unique was the competition for

26
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:39,900
quite simply world domination.
Let's back up and start at the beginning.

27
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:41,760
Prior to each other,

28
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:45,960
England and Francis greatest enemy was
the vikings who ravaged both of these

29
00:01:45,961 --> 00:01:50,100
nations while they were still evolving
into the ones we note today. England,

30
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:52,230
a part of an island took the harder hit,

31
00:01:52,410 --> 00:01:57,410
but France suffered as well and the nine
11 and the French king actually gave a

32
00:01:57,931 --> 00:02:02,760
viking warlord named Rollo in area of
land in the north to settle down in as

33
00:02:02,761 --> 00:02:07,530
tribute. This region became known as
Normandy, the land of the north men.

34
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,030
Why am I telling you this?

35
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:13,290
Because these Normans preceded the
conflicts between England and France.

36
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,240
By the middle of the 11th century,

37
00:02:15,241 --> 00:02:19,560
the Normans had become a mix of French
and vikings retaining the Viking Spirit

38
00:02:19,561 --> 00:02:21,330
for exploration and conquest,

39
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:25,200
but speaking French and having adopted
French culture of Christianity and

40
00:02:25,201 --> 00:02:26,310
military reforms.

41
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:29,940
The Duke of Normandy was technically
is subject of the French king,

42
00:02:29,941 --> 00:02:33,660
but realistically,
the Normans were an independent nation.

43
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:39,110
In the year 10 66 the Normans under
Duke Guillaume invaded England and

44
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:43,860
[inaudible] better known as William
the conqueror became king of England.

45
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:48,630
This Norman conquest resulted in a
lot of changes to England in language,

46
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:50,220
law, culture, et Cetera,

47
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:54,600
but most relevantly politically because
the king of England was the Duke of

48
00:02:54,601 --> 00:02:57,360
Normandy and therefore
technically a French subject.

49
00:02:57,390 --> 00:03:01,780
Tension over power became inevitable as
England was drawn into the complicated

50
00:03:01,781 --> 00:03:02,291
politics,

51
00:03:02,291 --> 00:03:07,291
if France of the day 1154
in a very stereotypically
meaningful situation after a

52
00:03:08,231 --> 00:03:10,780
succession crisis known as the monarchy,

53
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:14,260
Henry the second two became king
of England and Duke of Normandy,

54
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:17,520
but had also because of inheritance,
already rural.

55
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:22,090
These lands here as Duke of Aquitaine and
countable issue and thus ruled what is

56
00:03:22,091 --> 00:03:25,960
referred to by historians as the
knowledge of Van Empire. As you can see,

57
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:30,460
these lands cut right through France and
the rights over these lands as well as

58
00:03:30,461 --> 00:03:34,360
the rights to the Thrones of England and
France and selves became the source of

59
00:03:34,361 --> 00:03:36,400
conflict for much of the medieval era.

60
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:41,500
The most notable medieval conflict
between England and France was the hundred

61
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:43,990
years war.
Another term invented by historians,

62
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:48,970
which actually refers to four separate
wars over the period of 116 years.

63
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:53,680
England was victorious in the early
phases of the war, but in the final war,

64
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:55,750
the French had achieved
their ultimate goals.

65
00:03:55,930 --> 00:04:00,930
That is to say retaining territorial
integrity and political independence and

66
00:04:01,181 --> 00:04:05,080
effectively won the war. The war is,
we're very draining to both nations,

67
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:09,040
but at the end of them we see the
transformation of these two and to true

68
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:11,560
recognizable nation states.
However,

69
00:04:11,561 --> 00:04:15,580
the English were not necessarily done
after the hundred years war and in fact

70
00:04:15,581 --> 00:04:20,581
the monarch would claim the title of King
or Queen of France until 1803 when it

71
00:04:20,801 --> 00:04:24,940
was dropped in favor of the
depose monarchy. As Europe
entered the renaissance,

72
00:04:24,941 --> 00:04:27,670
the rivalry between England
and France did not weather,

73
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:32,560
but the focus was about to change from
localized squabbles to the competition to

74
00:04:32,561 --> 00:04:37,000
conquer the new world or really worlds
that the Europeans were beginning to

75
00:04:37,001 --> 00:04:41,170
chart.
Around the year 1008 a group of Vikings,

76
00:04:41,171 --> 00:04:45,160
unrelieved Erickson became the first
Europeans to reach the Americas.

77
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:50,520
Everyone ignored this and in 1492 the
Spanish under Christopher Columbus became

78
00:04:50,921 --> 00:04:53,260
the first Europeans to reach the Americas.

79
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:57,880
Spain and Portugal quickly became the
first nations to establish settlements and

80
00:04:57,881 --> 00:05:02,050
claim territory in the new world of
America as well as Africa and Asia.

81
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:03,310
And as time went on,

82
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:07,840
the Dutch Swedish Russians and of course
English and French would enter the game

83
00:05:07,841 --> 00:05:11,830
as well. These nations, specifically
Spain, Portugal, England,

84
00:05:11,831 --> 00:05:16,660
and France could realistically be called
the first world powers in the sense

85
00:05:16,661 --> 00:05:20,470
that they were the first nations to
be able to have influence and project

86
00:05:20,471 --> 00:05:22,360
military power across the globe.

87
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:25,480
The English and French were
late to the game comparatively,

88
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:29,680
but by the year 1700 it was clear that
they would be the most major world

89
00:05:29,681 --> 00:05:32,920
players, specifically in
North America and South Asia.

90
00:05:33,010 --> 00:05:36,640
Africa would not be heavily colonized
until almost two centuries later,

91
00:05:37,090 --> 00:05:41,140
Spain and Portugal were in decline.
Sweden and the Dutch had been knocked out.

92
00:05:41,170 --> 00:05:44,860
Russia was not heavily involved in
colonization and focused more on its own

93
00:05:44,861 --> 00:05:48,760
contiguous territories and the rest of
Europe did not or could not make much

94
00:05:48,761 --> 00:05:52,930
effort toward colonization. A number of
conflicts emerged in the 18th century,

95
00:05:52,931 --> 00:05:56,500
which spilled over into other
theaters. Most notably, as I said,

96
00:05:56,530 --> 00:05:59,360
the India and the coast of Africa.

97
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:04,010
The most important of these words was
what is called the seven years' war known

98
00:06:04,011 --> 00:06:06,590
in America as the French and Indian war,

99
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:11,620
where it would actually last for nine
years from 1754 to 1763 the war remains

100
00:06:12,711 --> 00:06:17,060
one of the most significant and world
history as essentially an 18th century

101
00:06:17,061 --> 00:06:21,410
world war leading one side England
or more correctly at this point,

102
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:25,580
Britain and on the other
France hanging in the balance,

103
00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:30,080
the fate of the world itself. If
one side, decisively one here,

104
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:33,710
it would affect not only Europe,
not only America and India,

105
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:38,690
but also even later colonization in
Africa, Oceania and the rest of Asia.

106
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:44,110
In 1763 Britain emerge victorious in all
theaters and thus happily sat upon its

107
00:06:45,351 --> 00:06:48,860
place as the world's
unchallenged top colonial power,

108
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:53,750
but France was not done and quite
unhappy about this would later support a

109
00:06:53,751 --> 00:06:57,710
rebellion and the British American
colonies that became the American war of

110
00:06:57,711 --> 00:07:02,120
independence, which as they intended
Delta major blow to the British empire.

111
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:02,960
Nevertheless,

112
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:07,490
the British empire recovered and even
sought out Newlands like Australia and New

113
00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:11,240
Zealand, while the rest of Europe failed
to keep up the 18th century is sometimes

114
00:07:11,241 --> 00:07:15,680
referred to as the second hundred years
war because the two powers were quite

115
00:07:15,681 --> 00:07:19,820
frankly in constant conflict following
the French and Indian war. As I said,

116
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,990
France was clearly on the losing
end and by the end of the century,

117
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:28,400
economic strain related to this constant
militarism was a major contributing

118
00:07:28,401 --> 00:07:30,080
factor to the French revolution,

119
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:34,580
which toppled the old San regime and
establish the French republic. At first,

120
00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:37,370
Britain laughed,
but when events became more serious,

121
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:41,030
the king and queen were executed and
the new republic establish itself by

122
00:07:41,031 --> 00:07:42,680
defeating the major powers of Europe.

123
00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:47,240
Britain recognize the situation
was serious when Napoleon
Bonaparte over through

124
00:07:47,241 --> 00:07:50,360
the Republican government and crowned
himself emperor of the French.

125
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:55,160
It was clearly very serious.
France now challenged not only Britain,

126
00:07:55,190 --> 00:07:59,420
but the whole of Europe as the military
genius Napoleon Bonaparte said about

127
00:07:59,421 --> 00:08:03,860
intending to create an empire
extending across Europe for a time.

128
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:06,140
He was basically successful in doing so,

129
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:08,150
but though Britain was
one of his main targets,

130
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:12,560
he was never successfully able to reach
it. Britain was naturally Napoleon's,

131
00:08:12,561 --> 00:08:16,100
most powerful rival and was the
forest rallying Europe against him.

132
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:18,830
He was very nearly
successful in defeating them,

133
00:08:18,890 --> 00:08:21,260
but following the naval
battle of Trafalgar,

134
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:26,330
Napoleon's plans to conquer Britain were
put aside and he focused on continental

135
00:08:26,331 --> 00:08:27,800
Europe instead.
However,

136
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:32,830
Napoleon was finally defeated in 1815
it's really around this time that 800

137
00:08:33,531 --> 00:08:35,960
years following the Norman
conquest of England,

138
00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:39,530
the infamous Anglo French
rivalry begins to wind down.

139
00:08:39,890 --> 00:08:44,890
Europe entered into a period sometimes
referred to as packs for Tanika for

140
00:08:45,171 --> 00:08:50,171
British peace lasting from 1815 to
1914 in which very few major wars were

141
00:08:51,501 --> 00:08:52,100
fought.

142
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:56,370
Britain was the world's leading power
in this time and pursued it's imperial

143
00:08:56,371 --> 00:08:57,150
ambitions.

144
00:08:57,150 --> 00:09:01,140
And while France did indeed to bill
the colonial empire and remained a very

145
00:09:01,141 --> 00:09:03,030
powerful and influential nation,

146
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:06,990
it never really challenged Britain
again and the ways it had in the past.

147
00:09:07,050 --> 00:09:07,883
In fact,

148
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:11,820
the Napoleonic wars were really the
last time Britain and France went to war

149
00:09:11,821 --> 00:09:15,720
with each other from here on out. In
fact, they'd be fighting on the same side,

150
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:20,130
which was foreshadowed by their joint
efforts in the Crimean war against Russia.

151
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:25,520
And so this great rivalry started to
come to a close after 1815 the two power

152
00:09:25,851 --> 00:09:29,850
started to set aside their differences
and even began to work together.

153
00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:31,650
But why?
Well,

154
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:35,790
there are a number of reasons
that cooperation would be
strategically favorable,

155
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:40,820
but the big reason occurring in the latter
half of the 18 hundreds was Germany.

156
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:43,440
Germany,
for most of its history,

157
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:48,210
consisted of a collection of fragmented
microstates called the Holy Roman Empire

158
00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:52,920
with Austria and Prussia being the only
nations within that empire capable of

159
00:09:52,921 --> 00:09:55,950
projecting power beyond their
borders to a major extent.

160
00:09:56,190 --> 00:10:01,020
By the 18 hundreds most of
the old European nations
were experiencing some form

161
00:10:01,021 --> 00:10:03,300
of major change,
including Germany.

162
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:08,400
In 1871 pressure had won that debate
against Austria over who would be the

163
00:10:08,401 --> 00:10:12,390
master of the German lands and then
defeated France in a war allowing the

164
00:10:12,391 --> 00:10:17,010
Germans to unify and evolved into the
modern nation. We note the day as Germany,

165
00:10:17,130 --> 00:10:21,100
Germany wasted no time and throwing
its weight around and quickly establish

166
00:10:21,101 --> 00:10:22,830
itself as a major power.

167
00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:27,270
This was naturally worrying to Britain
and France and they decided it would be

168
00:10:27,271 --> 00:10:31,020
in their best interest to set aside
their differences to prevent Germany from

169
00:10:31,021 --> 00:10:33,000
taking advantage of any weaknesses.

170
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:37,230
The awkward new found friendship between
Britain and France was cemented when

171
00:10:37,231 --> 00:10:42,120
they stood together as allies in both
world wars and continue to during the Cold

172
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:46,980
War and into the modern day as the two
nations still largely find cooperation to

173
00:10:46,981 --> 00:10:50,850
be in their best interest with their
tents. Rivalries long behind them,

174
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:54,990
though the modern age has seen Britain
and France work as partners and some

175
00:10:54,991 --> 00:10:59,040
parts of the world, the remnants of
Anglo French enmity can still be found.

176
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:02,040
The most obvious example of
this is in North America,

177
00:11:02,070 --> 00:11:06,270
specifically in Canada when the British
defeated the French and the French and

178
00:11:06,271 --> 00:11:07,920
Indian war and North America,

179
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:12,090
they took the majority of its main
land holdings except for Louisiana,

180
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:16,470
which was given this Spain and later
sold to the United States. However,

181
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:20,670
the British were not successful
and assimilating the local
French populations of

182
00:11:20,671 --> 00:11:22,320
the territory which they annexed,

183
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:26,520
and these people are the people
we know today as French Canadians.

184
00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:28,830
I planned the cover this
more in a future video,

185
00:11:28,831 --> 00:11:33,180
but the term French Canadian tends to
refer to the descendants of the French

186
00:11:33,181 --> 00:11:36,840
colonists in North America prior
to the seven years' war in general,

187
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:39,390
they typically see themselves
as their own group,

188
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:41,370
less related to the European French.

189
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:44,370
So if someone immigrated
from France to Canada today,

190
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:48,810
they wouldn't really be considered as a
part of the same cultural linguistic or

191
00:11:48,811 --> 00:11:53,740
even ethnic group in the United States.
Though in some parts the country,

192
00:11:53,770 --> 00:11:56,860
the language is still spoken
and the culture remains alive.

193
00:11:56,890 --> 00:12:01,810
Ethnic French Canadians such as those
who history was in Louisiana or Michigan

194
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:06,310
and those who immigrated later including
my family are largely assimilated as

195
00:12:06,311 --> 00:12:09,040
full Americans in Canada.
However,

196
00:12:09,070 --> 00:12:13,960
French culture remains distinct from
British Canadian culture historically and

197
00:12:13,961 --> 00:12:16,090
Quebec and Acadia in particular,

198
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:20,380
the French Canadian people have emphasized
marrying only within their group,

199
00:12:20,410 --> 00:12:23,350
remaining Catholic and retaining
their culture and language.

200
00:12:23,351 --> 00:12:26,890
Despite external forces are not
quite this strict these days.

201
00:12:27,070 --> 00:12:31,780
This resilience is why the French presence
in North America did not disappear.

202
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:36,220
In fact, it nearly led to a split
in Canada on multiple occasions.

203
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:41,200
The most famous incident being in
1995 when Quebec took a vote on its

204
00:12:41,201 --> 00:12:42,040
independence,

205
00:12:42,190 --> 00:12:47,190
the wheat vote amounted to 49.42% of the
population with no amounting to 50.58%

206
00:12:50,650 --> 00:12:55,240
a very close vote and the issue is still
debated to this day a conflict stemming

207
00:12:55,241 --> 00:12:59,770
for almost a thousand years
and the solutions to concerns
as far back as the 17

208
00:12:59,771 --> 00:13:04,270
hundreds still in some areas remain
unresolved and hotly debated.

209
00:13:04,690 --> 00:13:05,980
I hope you enjoyed this video.
