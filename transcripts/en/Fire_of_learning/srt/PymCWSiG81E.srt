00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:03,900
Hello and welcome to fire of
learning Niccolo Machiavelli's book.

2
00:00:03,901 --> 00:00:08,901
The prince was published in 1530 to five
years after his death and in this video

3
00:00:08,941 --> 00:00:13,410
we're going to take a look at 10 very
noteworthy tips from that book. As usual,

4
00:00:13,411 --> 00:00:16,170
I will attempt to deliver these
points without personal bias.

5
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:19,800
The book was written as a sort
of advice guide for politicians,

6
00:00:19,801 --> 00:00:23,040
specifically kings of the time.
Obviously this means taking literally,

7
00:00:23,041 --> 00:00:27,030
it isn't widely applicable as most of
us aren't kings. Maybe you are, I don't,

8
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:27,601
I don't know.

9
00:00:27,601 --> 00:00:32,450
But the advice is not applicable only
for monarchs or even general politicians.

10
00:00:32,451 --> 00:00:36,960
It can be translated and utilized for
a number of professions and situations

11
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:41,070
from business to social life to whatever.
So with that in mind, let's get started.

12
00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:44,730
Number 10 distrust,
mercenaries and auxiliaries.

13
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:48,270
Machiavelli believed that having soldiers
who weren't loyal are dependent on you

14
00:00:48,271 --> 00:00:49,590
was a disastrous error.

15
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:52,790
These types of soldiers were
only interested in their
own gain or had loyalties

16
00:00:52,791 --> 00:00:54,300
to someone else.
Accordingly,

17
00:00:54,301 --> 00:00:57,540
Machiavelli personally watched as the
Italian states who use these types of

18
00:00:57,541 --> 00:01:01,470
soldiers consistently failed and strongly
suggests raising troops of your own

19
00:01:01,471 --> 00:01:05,700
with a mutual goal. For example, the
success of your kingdom. Number nine,

20
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:10,020
you can't imitate great people exactly,
but you should try as much as possible.

21
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:10,621
Essentially,

22
00:01:10,621 --> 00:01:13,980
Machiavelli believed in learning from
those who were successful in history.

23
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:14,431
In fact,

24
00:01:14,431 --> 00:01:17,760
much of his advice is justified with
examples all the way back to ancient

25
00:01:17,761 --> 00:01:21,210
civilizations within a given position.
According to Machiavelli,

26
00:01:21,211 --> 00:01:24,570
you should attempt to imitate the habits
of those who were successful. However,

27
00:01:24,571 --> 00:01:25,021
of course,

28
00:01:25,021 --> 00:01:28,080
at times it will unavoidably have to
think and act on your own and these

29
00:01:28,090 --> 00:01:32,580
circumstances. Machiavelli advises that
his best to not be reckless. Number eight,

30
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:36,480
don't increase the power of rivals.
This seems obvious,

31
00:01:36,481 --> 00:01:40,500
but it's mistake far too often mate
Machiavelli used the then recent failed

32
00:01:40,501 --> 00:01:43,890
invasion of Italy by the King of France
as a consistent example throughout the

33
00:01:43,891 --> 00:01:47,610
book. Instead of assisting smaller states
against the larger Italian nations,

34
00:01:47,611 --> 00:01:50,880
he allied himself with the pope
and picked on smaller nations.

35
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,790
The pope took control of this
and seize more power for himself.

36
00:01:53,791 --> 00:01:56,760
Establishing his state as a
dominant in the region. Further,

37
00:01:56,761 --> 00:02:00,060
the King of France made it even worse
by allowing another rival and to the

38
00:02:00,061 --> 00:02:04,140
region. When Spain conquered
Naples in Sicily, number seven,

39
00:02:04,650 --> 00:02:07,380
when conquering new people
don't change too much.

40
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,500
While it's certainly true
that according to Margaret,

41
00:02:09,650 --> 00:02:12,840
one should take measures to ensure the
loyalty of nearly obtained subjects.

42
00:02:12,841 --> 00:02:16,680
He claims that the best way to do this
is to keep their laws taxes and such

43
00:02:16,681 --> 00:02:19,470
things mostly unchanged
and less necessary.

44
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:23,100
He even recommends allowing
them to forming local
government for their interests.

45
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:27,210
As long as the government is not hostile,
but dependent on you. Number six,

46
00:02:27,211 --> 00:02:31,740
without power, opportunity is wasted.
Without opportunity. Power is wasted.

47
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:35,640
Machiavelli believe leadership was a
combination of power and opportunity and

48
00:02:35,641 --> 00:02:38,460
not a wise leader could find ways to both.
Furthermore,

49
00:02:38,461 --> 00:02:40,530
he warns against obtaining
either with fortune,

50
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:44,160
reminding us that he who depends on
fortunate alone is a ruined when fortune

51
00:02:44,161 --> 00:02:47,550
changes depends upon yourself.
Number five,

52
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:51,330
we live so far removed from how we ought
to live that he who abandons what is

53
00:02:51,331 --> 00:02:54,720
done for what ought to be done,
we'll destroy himself rather than prevail.

54
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:59,310
Machiavelli believed that
morality, goodness, and
kindness, we're all nice ideas.

55
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:03,730
Realistically, one must do what they
have to do to survive, succeed and grow.

56
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:07,900
He cautions against trying to reform the
system and encourages rather rising and

57
00:03:07,901 --> 00:03:12,490
succeeding in it as change can often be
dangerous, especially if it is forced.

58
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:14,080
If you must change something though,

59
00:03:14,081 --> 00:03:19,060
do it with strength as armed
profits conquer but unarmed
ones fail. Number four,

60
00:03:19,061 --> 00:03:22,780
support from nobles and support from
the people are two different areas in

61
00:03:22,781 --> 00:03:26,170
either group could ruin you. The nobility
looks to achieve their own interests,

62
00:03:26,171 --> 00:03:29,400
namely by suppressing the people.
The people in turn are interested,

63
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:33,370
namely and not being suppressed and
ability may threaten you to achieve their

64
00:03:33,371 --> 00:03:36,700
own interest and the people will often
revolt if there are two headily pressed

65
00:03:36,701 --> 00:03:37,240
by you,

66
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:41,140
in which case the people are usually a
better ally to have for if you're hated

67
00:03:41,141 --> 00:03:43,270
by the people and the ability
will easily remove you.

68
00:03:43,271 --> 00:03:44,770
But if you were loved by the people,

69
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:48,310
the nobility will have a greater
difficulty dethroning you. Number three,

70
00:03:48,311 --> 00:03:51,220
one must master the art of
acting in the most efficient way,

71
00:03:51,221 --> 00:03:53,530
but looking as good of
a person as possible.

72
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:57,190
Machiavelli says that a prince should
attempt to look like someone who is

73
00:03:57,191 --> 00:04:00,670
merciful, faithful, respectable,
humane, religious and generous,

74
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:04,600
but behind the curtain may have to act
in the exact opposite way to achieve

75
00:04:04,601 --> 00:04:09,130
results as a times. Adherence to these
values may not only be disastrous,

76
00:04:09,131 --> 00:04:12,610
but it may come off as weakness and
Machiavelli Warren's greatly against the

77
00:04:12,611 --> 00:04:16,720
ruler who looks timid, frivolous, a
feminine, changeable or a resolute.

78
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:20,440
The Art of politics, therefore, in his
opinion, is mastering both the worlds.

79
00:04:20,710 --> 00:04:24,550
Number two, it is better to be feared
than to be loved, but if possible,

80
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:25,413
go for both.

81
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:29,140
Machiavelli recognizes the importance
of being favored by his subjects,

82
00:04:29,141 --> 00:04:31,720
but knows that too much
leniency may invite trouble.

83
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:35,440
Lean and sea bass out of love for the
people may suggest a weakness that may

84
00:04:35,441 --> 00:04:39,100
provide opportunities for rivals and
may decrease your power and therefore an

85
00:04:39,101 --> 00:04:43,210
element of fear is necessary in your
ruling in treating others fails.

86
00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:46,570
Using strength and force nearly
always succeeds. And accordingly,

87
00:04:46,690 --> 00:04:49,150
if you have to choose between
being loved and feared,

88
00:04:49,151 --> 00:04:50,890
it is better to go with being feared.

89
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:55,750
And the number one point from the prince
is at the end justifies the means.

90
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:58,630
Machiavelli believed that to
achieve efficient results,

91
00:04:58,631 --> 00:05:02,320
princess sometimes have to play a little
bit dirty, playing dirty. In fact,

92
00:05:02,321 --> 00:05:04,690
playing very dirty is
justifiable in his opinion,

93
00:05:04,691 --> 00:05:08,290
as long as the end result is
something favorable and good. However,

94
00:05:08,291 --> 00:05:11,050
he adds onto this that if you're
going to commit an atrocity,

95
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:14,050
it's better to do it all in
one day than to prolong it.

96
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:18,040
I he would be better to execute a hundred
people in one day than to kill one

97
00:05:18,041 --> 00:05:22,630
person each day over a hundred days while
each perhaps warrants the same results.

98
00:05:22,631 --> 00:05:23,141
Technically,

99
00:05:23,141 --> 00:05:26,800
the former secures your position with
fear and reassures rivals that you will

100
00:05:26,801 --> 00:05:28,480
act when crossed the ladder,

101
00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:31,540
gives the impression that you rule over
people to radically in that further on

102
00:05:31,541 --> 00:05:33,360
security to people must oppose it to you.

103
00:05:33,730 --> 00:05:37,360
So these have been Machiavelli's top
10 tips from his very famous book,

104
00:05:37,361 --> 00:05:39,580
the Prince.
It's certainly not as only advice though.

105
00:05:39,581 --> 00:05:42,850
I would highly recommend reading the
book and for more videos like this and

106
00:05:42,851 --> 00:05:44,470
videos on many other subjects,

107
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:46,990
I would invite you to check out
fire of learning and subscribe.

108
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:48,070
Thank you for watching.
