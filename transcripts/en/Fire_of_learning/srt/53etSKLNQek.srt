1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:04,500
When in the course of human events it
becomes necessary for one people to

2
00:00:04,501 --> 00:00:07,800
dissolve the political bands which
have connected them with another and to

3
00:00:07,801 --> 00:00:11,880
assume among the powers of the earth the
separate and equal station to which the

4
00:00:11,881 --> 00:00:14,070
laws of nature and of
nature's God entitled them.

5
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:17,940
A decent respect to the opinions of
mankind requires that they should declare

6
00:00:17,941 --> 00:00:20,100
the causes which impelled
them to the separation.

7
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:24,480
We hold these truths to be self
evident that all men are created equal,

8
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:27,360
that they are endowed by the creator
with certain unalienable rights.

9
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:28,770
That among these are life,

10
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:33,030
liberty and the pursuit of happiness that
to secure these rights governments are

11
00:00:33,031 --> 00:00:36,960
instituted among men deriving their just
powers from the consent of the governed.

12
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:40,710
That whenever any form of government
becomes destructive of these ends,

13
00:00:40,711 --> 00:00:43,140
it is the right of the people
to alter or abolish it.

14
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,770
And to institute a new government laying
its foundation on such principles and

15
00:00:46,771 --> 00:00:51,300
organizing its powers in such form as
to them shall seem most likely to effect

16
00:00:51,301 --> 00:00:52,650
their safety and happiness.

17
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:56,130
Prudence indeed will dictate that
governments long established should not be

18
00:00:56,131 --> 00:01:00,480
changed for light and transient causes
and accordingly all experience hath shown

19
00:01:00,481 --> 00:01:04,440
that mankind are more disposed to suffer
while evils are sufferable than to

20
00:01:04,441 --> 00:01:07,800
right themselves by abolishing the
forms to which they are accustomed.

21
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:11,940
But when a long train of abuses and
usurpations pursuing invariably the same

22
00:01:11,941 --> 00:01:15,990
object events is it designed to reduce
them under absolute despotism it is their

23
00:01:15,991 --> 00:01:16,500
right.

24
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:19,950
It is their duty to throw off such
government and to provide new guards for

25
00:01:19,951 --> 00:01:21,030
their future security.

26
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:24,990
Such has been the patient sufferance of
these colonies and such is now than it

27
00:01:24,991 --> 00:01:28,290
says that he was constrained as them to
alter their former systems of government.

28
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:31,590
The history of the present king of
Great Britain has a history of repeated

29
00:01:31,591 --> 00:01:35,340
injuries and usurpations all having in
direct object the establishment of an

30
00:01:35,341 --> 00:01:37,830
absolute tyranny over
these states to prove this,

31
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,080
let facts be submitted to a candid world.

32
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:44,010
He has refused his assent to laws the
most wholesome and necessary for the

33
00:01:44,011 --> 00:01:45,900
public good.
He has forbidden,

34
00:01:45,901 --> 00:01:49,290
has governors to pass laws of immediate
and pressing importance and less

35
00:01:49,291 --> 00:01:53,130
suspended and their operation till has
essentially be obtained and when so

36
00:01:53,131 --> 00:01:55,740
suspended he has utterly
neglected to attend to them.

37
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:59,970
He has refused to pass the real loss for
the accommodation of large districts of

38
00:01:59,971 --> 00:02:03,600
people unless those people
would relinquish the right
of representation in the

39
00:02:03,601 --> 00:02:07,470
legislature or write an estimable to
them and formidable to tyrants only.

40
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:10,500
He has called together legislative
bodies that places unusual,

41
00:02:10,501 --> 00:02:13,920
uncomfortable and distant
from the pository of their
public records for the sole

42
00:02:13,921 --> 00:02:16,710
purpose of fatiguing them into
compliance with his measures.

43
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:20,520
He has dissolved representative houses
repeatedly for opposing with manly

44
00:02:20,521 --> 00:02:24,720
firmness has invasions on the rights
of the people he has refused for a long

45
00:02:24,721 --> 00:02:28,140
time after such dissolutions to cause
others to be elected whereby the

46
00:02:28,141 --> 00:02:31,860
legislative powers and
capable of annihilation have
returned to the people at

47
00:02:31,861 --> 00:02:33,090
large for their exercise.

48
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:37,260
The state remaining in the
meantime exposed to all the
dangers of invasion from

49
00:02:37,261 --> 00:02:39,030
without and convulsions within.

50
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:42,660
He has endeavored to prevent
the population of these
states for that purpose of

51
00:02:42,661 --> 00:02:44,640
struck and laws of
naturalization of foreigners.

52
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:47,340
Refusing the past others to
encourage them migration,

53
00:02:47,341 --> 00:02:50,280
Heather and raising the conditions
of new appropriations of lands.

54
00:02:50,490 --> 00:02:54,000
He has obstructed the administration of
justice for refusing because it's sent

55
00:02:54,001 --> 00:02:56,550
to laws for establishing judiciary powers.

56
00:02:56,820 --> 00:03:00,880
He has made judges dependent on his will
alone for tenure of their offices and

57
00:03:00,881 --> 00:03:02,860
the amounts and payment of their salaries.

58
00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:07,000
He has erected a multitude of new offices
and sent Heather swarms of officers to

59
00:03:07,001 --> 00:03:09,310
harass our people and
eat out their substance.

60
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:13,600
He has kept among us in times of peace
standing armies without the consent of

61
00:03:13,601 --> 00:03:14,440
our legislature.

62
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:18,760
He has affected to render the military
independent of and superior to the civil

63
00:03:18,761 --> 00:03:22,660
power he has combined with others to
subject us to jurisdictions foreign to our

64
00:03:22,661 --> 00:03:26,080
constitution and unacknowledged
by our laws, giving his ascent,

65
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:30,310
their acts of pretended legislation for
quartering large bodies of arm troops

66
00:03:30,311 --> 00:03:34,240
among us for protecting them by a mock
trial from punishment for any murders

67
00:03:34,241 --> 00:03:37,900
which they should commit
on the inhabitants of these
states for cutting off our

68
00:03:37,901 --> 00:03:39,490
trade with all parts of the world,

69
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:43,300
for imposing taxes on us without
our consent for depriving us in.

70
00:03:43,301 --> 00:03:47,590
Many cases of the benefits of trial by
jury for transporting us beyond sees to

71
00:03:47,591 --> 00:03:49,270
be tried for pretended offenses,

72
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:52,840
for abolishing the free system of
English flaws in a neighboring province,

73
00:03:52,841 --> 00:03:56,860
establishing their in an
arbitrary government and
enlarging its boundaries so as

74
00:03:56,861 --> 00:04:00,670
to render it at once and example and
fit instrument for introducing the same

75
00:04:00,671 --> 00:04:04,060
absolute rule into these colonies
for taking away our charters,

76
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:07,720
abolishing our most valuable laws and
altering fundamentally to forms of our

77
00:04:07,721 --> 00:04:11,440
governments for suspending our own
legislature's and declaring themselves

78
00:04:11,441 --> 00:04:15,010
invested with power to legislate for
all of us in all cases whatsoever.

79
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:18,930
He has abdicated government here by
declaring us out of his protection and

80
00:04:18,931 --> 00:04:22,740
waging war against us. He has
plundered our CS, ravaged our coast,

81
00:04:22,741 --> 00:04:25,270
burnt our towns in his store,
the lives of our people.

82
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:28,900
He is at this time transporting
large armies of foreign mercenary.

83
00:04:28,901 --> 00:04:30,220
See Complete the works of death,

84
00:04:30,221 --> 00:04:34,700
desolation and tyranny already begun
with circumstances of cruelty, imperfect.

85
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:38,860
He's scarcely paralleled in
the most barbarous age as
in totally unworthy of the

86
00:04:38,861 --> 00:04:40,510
head of a civilized nation.

87
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:44,980
He has constrained our fellow citizens
taking captive on the high seas to bear

88
00:04:44,981 --> 00:04:48,790
arms against their country to become
the executioners of their friends and

89
00:04:48,791 --> 00:04:51,220
brethren or to follow
themselves by their hands.

90
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:55,390
He has excited the mastic insurrections
amongst us and has endeavored to bring

91
00:04:55,391 --> 00:04:57,160
on the inhabitance of our frontiers,

92
00:04:57,370 --> 00:05:01,180
the merciless Indian savages whose known
rule of warfare as an undistinguished

93
00:05:01,181 --> 00:05:03,880
destruction of all ages,
sexes, and conditions.

94
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:07,270
In every stage of these oppressions,
we have petition for redress.

95
00:05:07,271 --> 00:05:08,500
In the most humble terms,

96
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:12,550
our repeated petitions have been
answered only by repeated injury.

97
00:05:12,670 --> 00:05:15,580
A prince who his character
is us marked by every act,

98
00:05:15,581 --> 00:05:19,360
which made a finance [inaudible] is
unfit to be the ruler of a free people.

99
00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:22,780
Nor have we been wanting an
attention to our British brethren.

100
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:26,920
We have warned them from time to time
of attempts by the legislature to extend

101
00:05:26,921 --> 00:05:29,110
an unwarranted ball jurisdiction over us.

102
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:32,320
We have reminded them of the circumstances
of our immigration and settlements

103
00:05:32,321 --> 00:05:36,550
here we have appeal to
their native justice and
magnanimity and we have conjured

104
00:05:36,551 --> 00:05:40,450
them by the ties of our common kindreds
disavow these years for patients which

105
00:05:40,451 --> 00:05:43,210
would inevitably interrupt our
connections in correspondence.

106
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:46,810
They too have been desta voice
of Justice and constantly windy.

107
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:51,610
We must therefore acquiesce
and the necessity which
announces our separation and

108
00:05:51,611 --> 00:05:56,260
holds them as we hold the rest of mankind,
enemies in war and peace,

109
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:57,140
friends,

110
00:05:57,140 --> 00:06:01,100
we therefore the representatives of the
United States of America in general,

111
00:06:01,101 --> 00:06:04,240
Congress assembled appealing to
the supreme judge of the world,

112
00:06:04,241 --> 00:06:05,630
of the rectitude of our intentions.

113
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:09,830
Do in the name and by the authority
of the good people of these colonies,

114
00:06:09,831 --> 00:06:14,450
solemnly publish and declare that these
United colonies are and of right ought

115
00:06:14,451 --> 00:06:16,700
to be free and independent states,

116
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:19,610
that they're absolved from all
allegiance to the British crown.

117
00:06:19,611 --> 00:06:23,570
And that all political connection between
them and the state of Great Britain is

118
00:06:23,571 --> 00:06:27,590
and ought to be totally dissolved.
And that as free and independent states,

119
00:06:27,591 --> 00:06:31,520
they have full power to levy war
include piece, contract alliances,

120
00:06:31,610 --> 00:06:32,720
established commerce,

121
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:36,620
and so all the other acts and things
which independent states may have right.

122
00:06:36,621 --> 00:06:40,400
Do and for the support of this
declaration with a firm reliance on the

123
00:06:40,401 --> 00:06:44,180
protection of divine providence, we
mutually pledge to each other our lives,

124
00:06:44,181 --> 00:06:46,160
our fortunes,
and our sacred honor.
