Hello and welcome to fire of learning.

2
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:07,500
Today we're going to be discussing the
fall of the Roman empire and the Dark

3
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:09,360
Ages that subsequently and Gulfs Europe.

4
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:13,350
Some questions we must address and
this documentary are of course,

5
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:16,650
what caused the mighty
Roman Empire to collapse.

6
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:20,670
What was life like in the dark ages?
How dark? Where are they really?

7
00:00:20,671 --> 00:00:24,030
And if they were rather dark,
what made them this way?

8
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:28,680
What did people hold onto throughout
them and how did Europe eventually climb

9
00:00:28,681 --> 00:00:29,514
out of them?

10
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:34,650
This video today is made possible by
the patriotic support of Chris Yates,

11
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:39,270
so thank you again Chris. Now,
then let's get to it. Rome,

12
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:44,390
one 17 and the year of the death of
the emperor Trajan who building on the

13
00:00:45,571 --> 00:00:47,250
efforts of his predecessors,

14
00:00:47,251 --> 00:00:52,251
which at this time spend over 800
years expanded the Roman Empire to its

15
00:00:52,801 --> 00:00:57,030
pinnacle. While there is
still conflict on the borders,

16
00:00:57,090 --> 00:01:00,810
which other strong emperors who
succeed Trajan that same century,

17
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:03,120
such as Hadrian and Marcus Aurelius,

18
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:08,150
well pursue the empire itself is still
in an age of prosperity and relative

19
00:01:08,641 --> 00:01:12,840
peace known as Pax Romana,
the Roman peace.

20
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:17,760
This is the glorious Roman Empire
with which we are all familiar,

21
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:22,530
though was still sand for centuries to
come and while it was still in the middle

22
00:01:22,531 --> 00:01:26,810
of its golden age, the seeds of
catastrophe will soon be planted.

23
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:32,120
In one 77 the son of Marcus Aurelius
comedies became emperor communists,

24
00:01:33,061 --> 00:01:36,900
broke the chain of strong emperors,
which Rome had been enjoying that century.

25
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:39,510
He was foolish, cowardly, inept,

26
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,540
and outright sociopathic and insane.

27
00:01:42,690 --> 00:01:44,940
He ordered his guards to dance naked.

28
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:47,490
He drank in public while
dress like a woman.

29
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:50,670
He had hundreds of female
and male sex slaves,

30
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:55,140
but what really angered the Roman elites
known as patricians were things like

31
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:58,350
human sacrifice,
mutilating innocent people.

32
00:01:58,410 --> 00:02:03,150
And of course his participation in
gladiator fights in these mock fights,

33
00:02:03,151 --> 00:02:06,150
he would often take on
amputees and very brutal way.

34
00:02:06,151 --> 00:02:09,270
Just as an example of how he
would fight during this rain,

35
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:14,160
the Roman statesmen Cassius Deo would
claim the competence because the Rome to

36
00:02:14,161 --> 00:02:17,490
descend from a kingdom of
goal to one of rust and iron.

37
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:21,060
And indeed many historians agree
that roams very slowed down.

38
00:02:21,061 --> 00:02:23,740
Fall begins with the reign of comedies.

39
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:28,230
This went on for years until communist
was finally killed by being strangled

40
00:02:28,231 --> 00:02:32,250
while bathing the Senate that pretended
to love him while he was alive.

41
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:36,810
Basically we decided to make him a public
enemy once he died and tried to wipe

42
00:02:36,811 --> 00:02:41,280
out his memory altogether. Communists
was not the first lunatic emperor.

43
00:02:41,281 --> 00:02:46,050
The most famous example in Roman history
was of course Caligula who did things

44
00:02:46,051 --> 00:02:50,820
like make us horse a priest and ordered
his soldiers to stab the see and collect

45
00:02:50,821 --> 00:02:55,260
seashells as war trophies when he
declared war on the God Neptune.

46
00:02:55,650 --> 00:03:00,190
These things are of course funding to
us 2000 years later but also very sad

47
00:03:00,191 --> 00:03:04,330
because these were quite clearly very
mentally ill people who are placed in

48
00:03:04,331 --> 00:03:08,380
positions that allowed them to cause a
lot of damage and they were to the Romans

49
00:03:08,381 --> 00:03:10,120
at the time.
Very scary.

50
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:14,920
Obviously with Caligula the Romans had
whether these types of things before,

51
00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:18,100
but there was not much relief
following communist his death.

52
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:20,200
Much more common than insane.

53
00:03:20,201 --> 00:03:23,860
Emperors and statesmen and Rome
were corrupt and self serving ones.

54
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:26,560
Though plenty of both kinds
would come and as centuries,

55
00:03:26,561 --> 00:03:30,490
which followed the year of the five
emperors would follow his reign.

56
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:35,380
Person x, a military leader was made
emperor by the Praetorian Guard,

57
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:38,200
but then the guard killed
him within three months.

58
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:42,490
Didas you Leanna's succeeded him
by buying the position actually,

59
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:44,680
but then he was executed two months later.

60
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:48,400
Civil war in Rome then broke
out between two other claimants,

61
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:50,500
Septimius Severus and per skinniest.

62
00:03:50,501 --> 00:03:55,501
Niger Septimius would win this
war and rule for almost 18 years.

63
00:03:55,540 --> 00:04:00,540
But following him was a succession of
other corrupt and inept emperors and in

64
00:04:00,611 --> 00:04:04,300
fact, corrupt and inept officials
across the empire in general.

65
00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:05,830
So essentially,

66
00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:10,210
while the rule of communists and the year
of the five emperors may have been an

67
00:04:10,211 --> 00:04:12,220
unusually desperate time for Rome,

68
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:15,640
it did set the stage for other
similar behaviors to follow.

69
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:19,570
Things did not improve in a
third century as Rome entered.

70
00:04:19,571 --> 00:04:23,680
What is remembered as a crisis of
the third century during this period,

71
00:04:23,681 --> 00:04:27,420
along with the aforementioned
style of rural being commonplace,

72
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:31,720
civil war ravaged and divided,
the empire foreign armies attacked it.

73
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:33,910
The economy took a major downfall.

74
00:04:33,911 --> 00:04:38,740
There was a 13 year plague and many
other trouble is plagued Rome if people

75
00:04:38,741 --> 00:04:40,390
hadn't realized it before.

76
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:44,800
They definitely were now
starting to realize that Rome
wasn't trouble and indeed

77
00:04:44,801 --> 00:04:49,000
people were concerned that they were
facing a complete collapse of the empire,

78
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:53,740
if not the end of the world.
Intuity for Diocletian became emperor.

79
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:58,960
Diocletian was a low status soldier born
and modern day Croatia that rose to the

80
00:04:58,961 --> 00:05:03,850
ranks of the military and
eventually became emperor by
defeating other claimants.

81
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:08,060
Diocletian was the first strong
emperor Roman seen in quite awhile.

82
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:12,400
You recognize that Rome was in major
trouble and intended to reinvigorate the

83
00:05:12,401 --> 00:05:17,140
empire. We've discussed already some of
the things that were leading to and would

84
00:05:17,141 --> 00:05:21,700
eventually finally lead to Rome's
collapse entirely foreign invasion,

85
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:26,470
civil war and other domestic
struggles for power, economic turmoil,

86
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:28,000
et Cetera,
or remedy.

87
00:05:28,001 --> 00:05:32,050
Diocletian would come to would be to
split the empire between the East and the

88
00:05:32,051 --> 00:05:36,130
West. Rome was a giant empire
even by today's standards,

89
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:39,880
it stretched from Scotland to
the Persian Gulf. Naturally,

90
00:05:39,881 --> 00:05:44,110
if the empire turned his attention toward
one end of it, Scotland for example,

91
00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:48,130
then this would give someone in Egypt
and opportunity to seize control for

92
00:05:48,131 --> 00:05:52,780
themselves or cause some kind of chaos
in an age when word traveled slowly and

93
00:05:52,781 --> 00:05:57,781
people in armies much slower Diocletian
that suggested that the empire remain

94
00:05:57,831 --> 00:06:02,831
one single Roman empire but be divided
administratively between East and west

95
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:05,690
with two emperors.
Furthermore,

96
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:10,490
Diocletian would break the 50 or so Roman
provinces into over a hundred to ease

97
00:06:10,491 --> 00:06:15,140
administration of those as well.
These were generally successful or forums,

98
00:06:15,170 --> 00:06:19,310
at least temporarily. Many other
reforms such as expanding the army,

99
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:21,440
raising taxes to support that army,

100
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:26,660
trying to stop inflation and persecuting
Christians were not effective and many

101
00:06:26,661 --> 00:06:28,460
were in fact rather harmful.

102
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:32,600
He had also tried to stop civil war as
a means by which new emperor is came to

103
00:06:32,601 --> 00:06:37,220
power though after his reign.
This method once again became commonplace.

104
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:38,240
Admirably.

105
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:42,620
Diocletian was the first Roman emperor
to voluntarily resign living out his

106
00:06:42,621 --> 00:06:43,311
retirement,

107
00:06:43,311 --> 00:06:48,140
growing cabbages at his home until he
died in three 11 eight while splitting the

108
00:06:48,141 --> 00:06:52,130
empire helped administratively
financially it was a bad call.

109
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:56,600
The western empire was less wealthy
but had more financial burdens,

110
00:06:56,630 --> 00:07:00,230
namely supporting the military against
numerous enemies and you know the

111
00:07:00,231 --> 00:07:02,140
constant warfare.
Furthermore,

112
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:05,630
as expansion halted over the
late second and third centuries,

113
00:07:05,690 --> 00:07:10,100
the western economy which relied heavily
on slave labor from conquered peoples

114
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:14,120
started to suffer more as well.
With fever slaves obviously available.

115
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:18,770
The wealth of the western empire became
increasingly concentrated in the elite.

116
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:19,753
Meanwhile,

117
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:23,780
the lower classes struggled increasingly
leading to a loss of cohesion and

118
00:07:23,781 --> 00:07:28,580
society. This along with other
factors such as religious intolerance,

119
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:33,230
specifically toward Jews and much more
so the rising religion Christianity and

120
00:07:33,231 --> 00:07:38,060
what many Romans saw as a degradation of
their values would lead to a breakdown

121
00:07:38,061 --> 00:07:39,860
of the Romans sense of community.

122
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:43,730
It would be an emperor named Constantine
the great that would attempt to solve

123
00:07:43,731 --> 00:07:47,900
many of these issues while fighting and
yet another civil war for the throne and

124
00:07:47,901 --> 00:07:51,830
the early fourth century Constantine
claim to have received one of the most

125
00:07:51,831 --> 00:07:56,660
important messages in history and a sky
he saw across a Christian symbol and

126
00:07:56,661 --> 00:07:58,760
heard the words in Hawk signal.

127
00:07:58,790 --> 00:08:01,760
We get by this sign you shall conquer.

128
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:05,930
He then claimed to have a dream in which
he was visited by Christ where he was

129
00:08:05,931 --> 00:08:09,710
commanded a fight with the Cairo sign,
another Christian symbol.

130
00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:14,570
He did so and in the battle of the million
bridge defeated his opponents army,

131
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,340
which outnumber at him two to one.

132
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:20,090
This would go down in history as one
of the most important battles that were

133
00:08:20,091 --> 00:08:20,840
fought.

134
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:25,640
Constantine would enter Rome victoriously
and with later issue the edict of

135
00:08:25,641 --> 00:08:28,760
Milan along with the
eastern emperor lie sinneas.

136
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:33,890
This essentially allowed the worship
of Christianity and all other religions

137
00:08:33,891 --> 00:08:37,340
across the empire,
thus ending centuries of persecution.

138
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:41,900
It also grants it back to Christian's
all the lens which had been taken during

139
00:08:41,901 --> 00:08:43,490
Diocletian's persecution.

140
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:48,560
Later Constantine with the feet lies
sinneas in war and become emperor of both

141
00:08:48,561 --> 00:08:52,150
the West and the east. He was then
found a new capital of the east,

142
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:55,500
replaced a Greek pagan capital,
which symbolize vision.

143
00:08:55,680 --> 00:09:00,150
He would build a city on top of an
older city called Byzantium and named it

144
00:09:00,151 --> 00:09:04,350
after himself.
Constantinople for the more constant team,

145
00:09:04,351 --> 00:09:07,740
would help Christians organize the
Catholic church to its modern form.

146
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:09,690
Contrary to popular belief,

147
00:09:09,691 --> 00:09:14,010
Constantine did not immediately
convert to Christianity. In fact,

148
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:16,710
he spent most of his life
officially as a pagan,

149
00:09:16,711 --> 00:09:20,580
sort of bouncing around with and working
on both religions and drawing symbols

150
00:09:20,581 --> 00:09:23,970
from both of them and that sort of thing,
but towards the end of his life,

151
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,810
he would convert to Christianity. Becoming
a first Christian emperor of Rome,

152
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:31,020
thereby shocking much of the world.
It would not be long,

153
00:09:31,050 --> 00:09:35,280
perhaps only 60 years or so after
Constantine's death that most of Rome

154
00:09:35,281 --> 00:09:39,690
converted to Christianity as well.
In fact, about 80% of the empire.

155
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:44,850
This was a huge change and the effects
of Constantine's rural are still with us

156
00:09:44,851 --> 00:09:46,980
today.
Was Christianity,

157
00:09:46,981 --> 00:09:51,750
however beneficial to saving Rome
or did it hasten its downfall?

158
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:52,980
There is debate.

159
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:58,580
Some scholars argue that it led to a
breakdown of traditional Roman values.

160
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:03,090
Others argued that traditional
Roman values we're already
breaking down and that

161
00:10:03,091 --> 00:10:07,080
Christianity gave Romans and new
necessary focal point in their lives.

162
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:09,840
Regardless,
however of the state religion,

163
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:14,160
Rome still had other problems to
face throughout the fourth century.

164
00:10:14,161 --> 00:10:16,830
The barbarians became a
bigger and bigger problem.

165
00:10:17,010 --> 00:10:20,130
This along with increasing
financial difficulties,

166
00:10:20,190 --> 00:10:24,390
more inept neps leadership
after Constantine the great
or read a vision of the

167
00:10:24,391 --> 00:10:28,260
empire and other problems started
this spelled trouble for Rome.

168
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:29,640
In the fourth century,

169
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:33,900
barbarians began encroaching on Roman
territory and settling and parts of it and

170
00:10:33,901 --> 00:10:36,180
Rome often lack the
ability to remove them.

171
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:40,830
Eventually Romans began integrating more
and more barbarian soldiers into their

172
00:10:40,831 --> 00:10:42,630
armies to maintain their empire.

173
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:46,260
These soldiers were cheaper
but have less loyalty as well.

174
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:49,440
Typically they had no actual
concern for Rome itself,

175
00:10:49,590 --> 00:10:53,580
only for their barbarian commander and
their people and of course only cared

176
00:10:53,581 --> 00:10:57,900
about their personal gain from being in
the army in the late fourth and early

177
00:10:57,901 --> 00:10:58,950
fifth century.

178
00:10:58,951 --> 00:11:03,270
A group known as the hung's from the
Eurasian steppes began moving Westburg

179
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:05,310
displacing many dramatic tribes.

180
00:11:05,610 --> 00:11:09,000
These dramatic tribes
primarily gos in turn,

181
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:12,630
began pushing into Rome putting
more strain on Rome as well.

182
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:15,180
The goths were brought
in to the Roman empire,

183
00:11:15,181 --> 00:11:18,860
but were largely exploited and left
to starve, causing them to rebel.

184
00:11:18,861 --> 00:11:23,310
In three 76 this was when
Rome started the face serious,

185
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:26,790
irreparable damage.
The Romans would eventually win this war,

186
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:31,320
but it would be a pyrrhic victory as the
Romans had lost a considerable amount

187
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:35,790
and couldn't valance the emperor of the
east following this war would be to more

188
00:11:35,791 --> 00:11:36,690
civil wars,

189
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:41,870
which the emperor Theodosius was struggled
to win Theodosius die in three 95 the

190
00:11:42,601 --> 00:11:47,260
last, the ruler of both the east and
western Roman empire his sons had and our

191
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:48,900
[inaudible] would succeed him,

192
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:53,740
but they were essentially also inept
rulers getting the throne of a fractured

193
00:11:53,741 --> 00:11:54,574
empire.

194
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:59,110
A gothic leader Alaric would lead another
rebellion when the sons of the emperor

195
00:11:59,111 --> 00:12:03,130
Theodosius failed to give
him much opportunity of
advancement in the Roman army

196
00:12:03,131 --> 00:12:05,180
in which she was serving her.

197
00:12:05,210 --> 00:12:08,440
Nori is failed to adequately
respond to the situation,

198
00:12:08,441 --> 00:12:12,730
and it was a general Silico who was
responsible for much of Rome's defense.

199
00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:14,110
As in fact,

200
00:12:14,111 --> 00:12:18,700
Alaric marched on the city of Rome
itself still at co would defend Rome and

201
00:12:18,701 --> 00:12:22,600
other parts of the crumbling empire,
but it would be excessively difficult.

202
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:27,160
He pulled troops out of Britain and urged
his soldiers to bring those slaves to

203
00:12:27,161 --> 00:12:30,440
fight with them, and four oh
eight still a co a threat to her.

204
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:33,310
Norris has power was executed,
thus died.

205
00:12:33,311 --> 00:12:38,080
One of the last great Romans Alaric
moved into Italy towards Rome.

206
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:40,570
His forces were starving
and he needed food.

207
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:44,650
Though the Romans had little
themselves in for 10 80 Alaric sack,

208
00:12:44,651 --> 00:12:48,910
the city of Rome, the great city
had now fallen to barbarians.

209
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:54,070
Many truly believed that the end of the
world to come it is said that when the

210
00:12:54,071 --> 00:12:57,760
emperor Norris, who was living in
the city of Ravenna heard the news,

211
00:12:57,761 --> 00:13:01,360
he cried out and yet it had
just eaten from my hands.

212
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:06,070
He apparently thought that they meant
his favorite chicken named the Roma was

213
00:13:06,071 --> 00:13:10,210
what had perished. Roma is, as I'm sure
you can tell, the Latin word for Rome,

214
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:14,470
and when he learned it was a city instead,
he was relieved.

215
00:13:14,530 --> 00:13:19,360
This just goes to show how out of touch
with reality high norjes really was and

216
00:13:19,361 --> 00:13:19,811
in fact,

217
00:13:19,811 --> 00:13:24,310
many Roman politicians and aristocrats
were completely out of touch and it came

218
00:13:24,311 --> 00:13:28,900
at one of the worst possible times
Alaric and his Visigoths banning the fine

219
00:13:28,901 --> 00:13:31,990
much food in Rome left
for greener pastures.

220
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:36,730
Throughout the next few
decades of barbarian tribes
began settling and Hispana

221
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:37,960
per Tanya Gall,

222
00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:42,490
north Africa and other parts of the empire
and the Romans were largely powerless

223
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:46,210
to remove them and in fact negotiated
ways to peacefully integrate them.

224
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:47,950
Barbarian tribes,
again,

225
00:13:47,951 --> 00:13:52,540
primarily Visigoths would ally themselves
with Rome to Repel Attila the hun and

226
00:13:52,541 --> 00:13:53,374
his forces,

227
00:13:53,410 --> 00:13:58,410
but when he was given back and died
unexpectedly and four 53 conflict was back

228
00:13:58,901 --> 00:14:00,670
on,
ultimately,

229
00:14:00,730 --> 00:14:05,560
the barbarian forces in the Roman army
known as the Federal Rati would unite

230
00:14:05,590 --> 00:14:07,930
under a leader of unknown
ethnic background,

231
00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:12,990
possibly a hun named out Walker and four
76 auto Acker would overthrow the last

232
00:14:14,471 --> 00:14:17,680
Roman emperor,
ironically named Romulus that year.

233
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:21,820
On September 4th and proclaim
himself king of Italy.

234
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,250
After over a thousand years,

235
00:14:24,310 --> 00:14:27,760
Rome had now officially collapsed Romulus.

236
00:14:27,761 --> 00:14:32,761
Only 16 at the time was allowed to
quietly retire as Rome's light was

237
00:14:32,771 --> 00:14:33,610
extinguished.

238
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:39,100
A key point to take from the fall of Rome
was that it was not merely the result

239
00:14:39,130 --> 00:14:40,810
of barbarian invasion.

240
00:14:41,050 --> 00:14:46,050
It was firstly a combination of several
factors that we can roam significantly

241
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:47,830
economically.

242
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:52,010
There were labor shortages from the
lack of slave labor taxation increased

243
00:14:52,011 --> 00:14:56,390
heavily and the money was the valued
from inflation for the more much this tax

244
00:14:56,391 --> 00:15:01,130
money went to fund the
military and infrastructure
was ignored. Administratively,

245
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:05,720
the empire definitely over expanded and
the division between the West and east,

246
00:15:05,721 --> 00:15:09,860
which temporarily helped ultimately
would cause a two sides of grow apart

247
00:15:09,890 --> 00:15:13,940
leaving the western empire, which was less
wealthy and had more enemies weakened.

248
00:15:14,510 --> 00:15:18,020
Furthermore, as if administration
of the empire wasn't hard enough,

249
00:15:18,021 --> 00:15:21,980
it was being overseen by a number of
corrupt and self-serving emperors and

250
00:15:21,981 --> 00:15:26,690
elites. A large number of Roman emperors
were assassinated by competitors.

251
00:15:27,170 --> 00:15:30,980
Others had to fight civil wars with the
throne and others having achieved it

252
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:35,330
behaved selfishly and competently or
sometimes rather like click ula or

253
00:15:35,331 --> 00:15:36,164
communists.

254
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:40,970
There was a similar situation
of ineptitude and apathy
in the Senate as well and

255
00:15:40,971 --> 00:15:42,950
furthermore,
with the weakened government,

256
00:15:43,010 --> 00:15:47,300
the wealthier class was able to flee to
the countryside and avoid taxation and

257
00:15:47,301 --> 00:15:48,830
participation in the state.

258
00:15:49,070 --> 00:15:53,180
We can even take into consideration the
sudden shift and religion which had an

259
00:15:53,181 --> 00:15:57,650
impact on a sudden shift
in values, beliefs and
perspectives of the Roman people.

260
00:15:58,130 --> 00:15:59,540
Though,
as I said at the debate,

261
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:03,830
continues as to whether
or not Christianity helped
Rome or hastened it's fall.

262
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:08,480
It was this society which the barbarian
tribes that would ultimately cause roms.

263
00:16:08,481 --> 00:16:12,620
Downfall found a rather
important distinction, however,

264
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:16,520
was that they did not all invade
room and a traditional sense.

265
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:21,080
Rome faced many invasions which crippled
it, especially in later centuries,

266
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:25,310
but many other incidents viewed as
invasions. We're really revolts.

267
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:28,340
The gothic wars of
three to 76 for example,

268
00:16:28,341 --> 00:16:32,510
was a revolt on a taken by the Goss who
had been, I don't want to say welcomed,

269
00:16:32,690 --> 00:16:37,440
but legally brought into the empire and
allowed settle Alaric and not a slacker,

270
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:38,870
weren't foreign invaders.

271
00:16:38,930 --> 00:16:41,900
They were both Latin speaking
members of the Roman army,

272
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:46,220
but they and their soldiers were at
barbarian and origin and had no real

273
00:16:46,221 --> 00:16:50,450
connection to the empire beyond the
superficial opportunity that they saw as

274
00:16:50,451 --> 00:16:55,451
migraines while fleeing from the huns and
thus with the fall of the Roman Empire

275
00:16:56,660 --> 00:16:56,720
Europe.

276
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:01,220
And while the Western world in general
really falls into what historians call

277
00:17:01,221 --> 00:17:04,100
the early Middle Ages or the dark ages.

278
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:09,080
But while the dark ages are
painted as a regressive, unstable,

279
00:17:09,081 --> 00:17:11,210
and archaic, fearful, primitive time,

280
00:17:11,570 --> 00:17:14,090
the story of this age is very complicated.

281
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:18,740
Society did regress in many ways
for many people living in the times.

282
00:17:18,741 --> 00:17:23,210
The world was comparatively darker than
it had been in the past for reasons

283
00:17:23,211 --> 00:17:26,780
which we will discuss. But there
was also a lot going on in his time.

284
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:30,950
There were many important and great
moments in history which took place in an

285
00:17:30,951 --> 00:17:35,600
age which historians may unfairly scoring
sometimes in the decades following the

286
00:17:35,601 --> 00:17:39,560
fall of Rome. A number of
things happen. Multiple success.

287
00:17:39,561 --> 00:17:42,680
We kingdoms arise in the all
territories of the empire.

288
00:17:43,010 --> 00:17:47,660
This is a map of Europe in a year,
524 years after rung fell.

289
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:52,710
As you can see, the kingdom's formed by
the Visigoths, the Franks, the Ostrogoths,

290
00:17:52,711 --> 00:17:53,850
the Anglo Saxons,

291
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:57,420
and the Burgundians are some of the
most important kingdoms following Rome's

292
00:17:57,421 --> 00:18:02,340
fault. Most of the successor kingdoms are
led by dramatic tribes whom the Romans

293
00:18:02,341 --> 00:18:04,530
considered barbarians.
Now,

294
00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:08,400
there is a portrayal of these
kingdoms being formed by savages,

295
00:18:08,401 --> 00:18:11,580
living in huts after having
burned down Roman civilization,

296
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:14,790
but many of these kingdoms actually
kind of built on top of Rome.

297
00:18:14,790 --> 00:18:18,990
They worked with Roman aristocracy.
They were in many ways, Roman.

298
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:22,260
A good example of this was out
of whack or his kingdom of Italy.

299
00:18:22,261 --> 00:18:26,820
Actually auto wacker would naturally
make an effort to depose of his Roman

300
00:18:26,821 --> 00:18:27,660
competitors,

301
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:32,220
but the Roman Senate would
actually continue to function
during his reign and he

302
00:18:32,221 --> 00:18:36,690
drew on their support for a large amount
of power and the state would gradually

303
00:18:36,691 --> 00:18:40,920
join the Ostrow gothic Kanombe as time
went on, which in many ways was as well.

304
00:18:40,921 --> 00:18:42,270
Roman.
Furthermore,

305
00:18:42,271 --> 00:18:46,560
many of these so called barbarians were
as I discussed earlier, rather romanized.

306
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:48,810
They spoke varieties of Latin,

307
00:18:48,811 --> 00:18:53,340
which was slowly evolve
into other languages like
French, Italian, and Spanish.

308
00:18:53,790 --> 00:18:58,050
Many followed the Roman
religion of Christianity
though for many it was area and

309
00:18:58,051 --> 00:19:01,560
Christianity, which was slightly different
from the Catholic Christianity. A Rome,

310
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:05,550
regardless the area and Christians in
Italy still heavily respected a Catholic

311
00:19:05,551 --> 00:19:08,070
church centered in a city of Rome.

312
00:19:08,550 --> 00:19:11,610
Many would say that Rome
never truly fell all the way,

313
00:19:11,611 --> 00:19:15,540
but instead it survived.
In the Latin speaking Catholic Church.

314
00:19:15,930 --> 00:19:19,680
During the five hundreds of Frank's
began moving westward from modern day

315
00:19:19,681 --> 00:19:24,000
Belgium into the rest of modern
France. Their leader, Clovis unified,

316
00:19:24,001 --> 00:19:27,810
the Frankish tribes effectively laying
the foundations for the modern nation of

317
00:19:27,811 --> 00:19:30,940
France and the Merovingian Dynasty,
which was to rule it.

318
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,630
He ruled from a city called Paris,

319
00:19:33,810 --> 00:19:37,350
which would now serve as the capital
of his people up to the modern day.

320
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:42,420
Clovis also converted to Christianity
becoming one of the first northern

321
00:19:42,421 --> 00:19:46,320
Germanic kings to do so, and he required
that as subjects convert as well,

322
00:19:46,350 --> 00:19:49,410
laying the foundation for Catholicism
to spread throughout Europe.

323
00:19:49,890 --> 00:19:53,520
As Europe became increasingly fragmented,
times became harder.

324
00:19:53,970 --> 00:19:57,960
Life became, as is often said,
nasty, brutish and short.

325
00:19:58,060 --> 00:19:59,070
In many ways,

326
00:19:59,071 --> 00:20:03,390
Christianity would be what gave the
people of Europe unity and hope and its

327
00:20:03,391 --> 00:20:07,860
expansion from its Roman origins begins
with these Germanic peoples adopting it.

328
00:20:08,730 --> 00:20:12,210
The Franks, however, we're
politically unable to form a large,

329
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:17,070
powerful successor state because of
inheritance laws. When Clovis died,

330
00:20:17,071 --> 00:20:20,460
his conquest were divided
again between his four sons.

331
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:25,350
Control of our power during such divisions
across Europe would be the main cause

332
00:20:25,351 --> 00:20:28,950
for large amounts of conflict that
marked the dark ages. In fact,

333
00:20:28,951 --> 00:20:33,330
in Merovingian France in particular,
they were very constant civil wars.

334
00:20:33,630 --> 00:20:37,590
We may have a hard time imagining how
this many civil wars can be erupting,

335
00:20:37,770 --> 00:20:41,430
but the concept of the state,
as we understand it today,

336
00:20:41,730 --> 00:20:44,610
was not yet present in Europe
in this period of history.

337
00:20:44,670 --> 00:20:49,000
The perspective of the time was that
the country belonged essentially to the

338
00:20:49,001 --> 00:20:53,740
king while post the Roman
Europe was modeled on the
skeleton of the Roman Empire

339
00:20:53,741 --> 00:20:57,700
in important ways. As time passed,
it became more and more clearly,

340
00:20:57,701 --> 00:20:59,260
really just a skeleton.

341
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:03,940
Trade and infrastructure broke down
relatively quickly and the past

342
00:21:03,941 --> 00:21:05,650
Mediterranean was a Roman Lake,

343
00:21:05,651 --> 00:21:08,770
which connected this Atlanta
allowing trade to flourish.

344
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:13,060
Now the trade system's broke down
as the roads fell into disuse and a

345
00:21:13,061 --> 00:21:15,880
countryside and sees
became dangerous places,

346
00:21:16,210 --> 00:21:20,980
much of Europe return to the
more localized agricultural
societies that predated

347
00:21:20,981 --> 00:21:21,940
the Roman Empire.

348
00:21:22,270 --> 00:21:26,770
When Rome fell and warfare and plundering
of cities became more constant lower

349
00:21:26,771 --> 00:21:27,640
class workers,

350
00:21:27,641 --> 00:21:32,530
both Roman and barbarian fled to the
countryside to escape it and made deals

351
00:21:32,531 --> 00:21:36,580
with Roman land,
owning aristocrats in exchange for work,

352
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:39,340
Roman aristocrats,
opera to house and defend them.

353
00:21:39,490 --> 00:21:43,060
A system which would evolve into the
feudal systems that dominated medieval

354
00:21:43,061 --> 00:21:47,620
Europe. While we can debate and discuss
the validity of the term dark ages.

355
00:21:47,710 --> 00:21:51,760
There are many very obviously dark
features of this post Roman world.

356
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:54,130
As a result of all the
changes we just discussed,

357
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:59,400
European societies became much smaller
places throughout the centuries following

358
00:21:59,531 --> 00:22:04,450
Rome. Education naturally also fell with
infrastructure and societal stability.

359
00:22:05,110 --> 00:22:09,490
Throughout much of the early ages,
only about 1% of the population,

360
00:22:09,550 --> 00:22:14,500
mostly the clergy could read.
Life expectancy dropped.
The population dropped,

361
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:19,360
four started to grow back. I knew
Europe became an eerily empty place.

362
00:22:19,510 --> 00:22:22,480
Roman ruins were often
stripped for building supplies.

363
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:26,440
The Colosseum in Rome served
for a time as a landfill.

364
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:30,760
The drop in education and the spreading
of information allowed for distant lands

365
00:22:30,761 --> 00:22:32,230
to become mysteries again.

366
00:22:32,530 --> 00:22:36,640
People were regularly nervous
about invaders or plunderers
whom they didn't see

367
00:22:36,641 --> 00:22:41,470
coming. Arriving suddenly on the scene,
the mysterious forest and countrysides,

368
00:22:41,471 --> 00:22:43,210
which were indeed dangerous places,

369
00:22:43,450 --> 00:22:48,010
also became the subjects of folktales and
the early Middle Ages were a source of

370
00:22:48,011 --> 00:22:52,120
many myths and folktales and such things
with which we are still familiar today.

371
00:22:52,390 --> 00:22:56,860
People told tales of Goblins,
ferries, witches, sorcerers, the debt,

372
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:01,880
etc. And many of those tails while they
were viewed as unacceptable pagan myths

373
00:23:02,650 --> 00:23:07,090
by the dominant Catholic Church still
lasted to stay in certain cases as

374
00:23:07,091 --> 00:23:09,850
original tails, but at least
generally informed, you know,

375
00:23:09,851 --> 00:23:12,430
something like the Lord of the rings.
For example,

376
00:23:12,431 --> 00:23:14,680
while it was written in the 20th century,

377
00:23:14,681 --> 00:23:18,160
much of it was based off of
dark age European mythology.

378
00:23:18,370 --> 00:23:20,770
Life was not all bad for these people's,

379
00:23:20,771 --> 00:23:23,740
but certainly as they lived
among the ruins of Rome,

380
00:23:23,890 --> 00:23:27,430
even the most uneducated had an
understanding that they were living in it,

381
00:23:27,431 --> 00:23:32,290
a graded world compared to the past.
While these kingdoms work to succeed,

382
00:23:32,291 --> 00:23:36,280
Rome in the West and the east,
the light of Rome continued to shine.

383
00:23:36,670 --> 00:23:39,550
The eastern Roman Empire
did not fall with the West.

384
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:44,380
Rather it evolved into the Byzantine
Empire and though they were Greek speaking

385
00:23:44,381 --> 00:23:46,190
and much more eastern and western,

386
00:23:46,490 --> 00:23:50,390
they continue to view themselves as
a Romans for the next thousand years,

387
00:23:50,391 --> 00:23:55,391
which Byzantium stood on August 1st five
27 the emperor Justinian came to the

388
00:23:55,971 --> 00:23:59,060
throne just sitting in the
great as he came to be called,

389
00:23:59,150 --> 00:24:00,920
had very clear intentions,

390
00:24:00,921 --> 00:24:05,390
which he called run Novato and
Patty the restoration of the empire.

391
00:24:05,660 --> 00:24:07,070
At this point in history,
Rome,

392
00:24:07,071 --> 00:24:11,510
he'd only been gone for about 50 years
and Justinian intended to bring it back

393
00:24:11,511 --> 00:24:13,370
by reconquering Roman territory,

394
00:24:13,371 --> 00:24:17,090
loss of the barbarians after
making a piece with the shop,

395
00:24:17,091 --> 00:24:20,870
the assassin had Persians there bribes.
He turned his forces westward.

396
00:24:21,110 --> 00:24:25,700
The general Bellis Saris invaded the
north African vandal lens and subdued them

397
00:24:25,701 --> 00:24:29,210
within a year, bringing
them into the empire. Next,

398
00:24:29,211 --> 00:24:33,290
he turned his attention to the lens of
the Ostrogoths. Unfortunately for him,

399
00:24:33,291 --> 00:24:35,030
he found much less success there.

400
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:39,380
It took 20 years rather cause subdue
them and it was a very debilitating

401
00:24:39,381 --> 00:24:44,000
campaign for both sides. And in the
end though, Italy had been reconquered.

402
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:47,780
Much of it was ruined in a conflict.
The city of Rome, for example,

403
00:24:47,781 --> 00:24:50,150
had been sacked five times
throughout these wars,

404
00:24:50,151 --> 00:24:54,920
firmly bringing them into the darkness
of the Dark Ages along with this failure.

405
00:24:55,010 --> 00:24:56,780
And it was a considerable failure.

406
00:24:57,040 --> 00:25:02,040
You have a cost Byzantium around 300,000
pounds of goal to rebuild Italy and war

407
00:25:02,511 --> 00:25:04,500
with the Persians,
presumed just any,

408
00:25:04,540 --> 00:25:08,720
and also had a rude awakening and
discovering that the societal structure of

409
00:25:08,721 --> 00:25:11,330
Rome had essentially
fallen apart at his time.

410
00:25:11,390 --> 00:25:14,960
And that rebuilding it in the West
after all this time was much more of a

411
00:25:14,961 --> 00:25:18,810
difficult prospect than he had
realized though Byzantium Hell,

412
00:25:18,811 --> 00:25:22,850
Don's the territory's and it seemed,
Rome was making a comeback of sorts.

413
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:27,620
A plague then suddenly struck Byzantium
known as the plague of Justinian.

414
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:30,650
This plague was one of
the worst in history.

415
00:25:30,770 --> 00:25:35,770
It killed 13% of the world's population
or about half the population of the

416
00:25:35,841 --> 00:25:40,310
Byzantine Empire. Within a year. Imagine
the effects of half the people you know,

417
00:25:40,311 --> 00:25:41,660
dying within a year.

418
00:25:42,170 --> 00:25:46,940
This is what just [inaudible] was facing
on an empire wide scale and he himself

419
00:25:46,941 --> 00:25:48,560
was eventually struck with the plague.

420
00:25:49,250 --> 00:25:51,770
He was one of the fortunate
ones to survive it,

421
00:25:51,890 --> 00:25:55,520
but it left him scarred and he became
increasingly erratic, tyrannical,

422
00:25:55,521 --> 00:25:56,354
and paranoid.

423
00:25:56,690 --> 00:26:01,070
Moreover though it left the empire
scarred and though Justinian brought about

424
00:26:01,071 --> 00:26:04,370
great things with Byzantium culture,
learning art,

425
00:26:04,430 --> 00:26:07,040
architecture like the highest Sophia,
et Cetera,

426
00:26:07,580 --> 00:26:12,580
the empire was far too irreparably
damaged by this plague to realistically

427
00:26:12,830 --> 00:26:14,300
rebuild the Roman Empire.

428
00:26:14,390 --> 00:26:17,990
It would not be long until Byzantium
slowly started to lose a lens at a

429
00:26:17,991 --> 00:26:21,410
conquered as well as some of
its own original lands as well.

430
00:26:22,250 --> 00:26:26,930
The lombards would start taking control
of northern Italy and later the Persians,

431
00:26:26,931 --> 00:26:31,550
AVRs, Bulgarians, Slavs, et cetera.
We'll close in on the empire as well.

432
00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:36,790
Byzantium gradually contracted in six
26 constant and Nopa was besieged by

433
00:26:37,641 --> 00:26:40,910
Persians AVRs.
The Byzantines would win,

434
00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:43,920
but these wars were indeed fracturing.
The empire.

435
00:26:44,010 --> 00:26:47,970
Ms Fracturing would leave the empire
too weak to defend against what would be

436
00:26:47,971 --> 00:26:52,971
the greatest enemy of the Byzantine
Empire is long and the six thirties Arabic

437
00:26:52,981 --> 00:26:57,030
followers of a new religion.
Islam began their quest for world empire.

438
00:26:57,270 --> 00:27:00,110
They found both Byzantium
and Persia to weaken,

439
00:27:00,111 --> 00:27:03,960
to withstand the assaults and within
a decade had spread and to Egypt,

440
00:27:03,990 --> 00:27:06,120
Iran and the border of Anatolia.

441
00:27:06,330 --> 00:27:11,220
By 780 the Umayyad caliphates stretched
from North Africa to Afghanistan

442
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:15,450
overtaking the Persians and most of
Byzantium is non European territory.

443
00:27:16,350 --> 00:27:20,550
The Islamic powers founded by the Arabs
and this time have a mixed place in

444
00:27:20,551 --> 00:27:22,500
history.
In some ways,

445
00:27:22,501 --> 00:27:26,910
definitely they would come to be the
enemies of European civilization and the

446
00:27:26,911 --> 00:27:30,630
enemies of what was left to Rome.
In other ways,

447
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:34,170
they were the successors of
classical civilization in the east.

448
00:27:34,710 --> 00:27:36,450
The Islamic golden age began,

449
00:27:36,451 --> 00:27:40,080
while much of Europe existed
in the aforementioned state
in the eighth century,

450
00:27:40,530 --> 00:27:44,610
and the peoples of this region, Arabs,
north Africans, Persians, et Cetera,

451
00:27:45,150 --> 00:27:49,950
took up science, history,
linguistics, medicine, literature,
philosophy, mathematics,

452
00:27:49,951 --> 00:27:54,670
and many other fields of education. As
Europe was still ruled on her frag method,

453
00:27:54,671 --> 00:27:58,980
successor states the Arabs began
pushing into Hispana and closer towards

454
00:27:58,981 --> 00:28:00,120
Constantinople,

455
00:28:00,330 --> 00:28:05,280
eventually besieging it in seven 17 the
siege of Constantinople was a failure,

456
00:28:05,281 --> 00:28:09,810
however, and that would leave the Arabs
weekend and drink Hispana, however,

457
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:13,330
was not a failure.
Throughout the eighth century that we,

458
00:28:13,331 --> 00:28:14,940
my odds would move at the modern day,

459
00:28:14,941 --> 00:28:18,160
Spain and Portugal conquering
the territories of the visit,

460
00:28:18,161 --> 00:28:22,260
gothic kingdom and beginning Islamic
rule of the peninsula that would last for

461
00:28:22,261 --> 00:28:26,280
centuries. Meanwhile, in the Frankish
empire, things were changing.

462
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:31,050
The Merovingian dynasty was losing power
and Muslim forces were moving in across

463
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:34,890
the pier and ease into modern France
standing in their way. However,

464
00:28:34,891 --> 00:28:37,560
with someone whom the Franks
would call shock Martel,

465
00:28:37,890 --> 00:28:42,660
Martel was old French for Hammer Charles
the hammer and the Mios gonna meet at

466
00:28:42,661 --> 00:28:46,980
the Battle of Tours on
October 10th seven 32 there,

467
00:28:47,010 --> 00:28:51,540
the Franks would score a decisive
victory over the Muslims killing 12,000

468
00:28:51,541 --> 00:28:55,110
including the enemy commander while
taking only 1000 or so losses.

469
00:28:56,040 --> 00:29:00,390
The pope hailed Martell is having saved
Europe from Muslim domination as they

470
00:29:00,391 --> 00:29:03,150
would never attempt to invade
Europe from the Pyrenees again.

471
00:29:03,510 --> 00:29:07,710
Following this spousal Martel's power
would grow enormously if a position is

472
00:29:07,711 --> 00:29:10,590
king, might seem a natural
next step. However,

473
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:15,660
he was ultimately unable and unwilling
to take that position. Instead,

474
00:29:15,661 --> 00:29:18,960
he organized himself to hold power
and rule from the background.

475
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:22,590
While Theodoric of the Merovingian
dynasty held the official title.

476
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:28,520
This was again mainly due
to the importance to Frank's
placed on tradition and

477
00:29:28,621 --> 00:29:31,860
though the monarchy was much
less powerful than it had been,

478
00:29:32,190 --> 00:29:35,520
there were still unwilling to do something
such as overthrowing the monarchy.

479
00:29:35,521 --> 00:29:39,450
They felt it might anger God that it
would be a front to their heritage and

480
00:29:39,451 --> 00:29:43,810
identity as a people et and Martell
newest people would not support him.

481
00:29:43,811 --> 00:29:44,644
For this reason.

482
00:29:45,010 --> 00:29:48,820
It would be his son rather Pepin the
short who would throw the Merovingians and

483
00:29:48,821 --> 00:29:51,250
begin the Carolingian dynasty in France.

484
00:29:51,970 --> 00:29:55,960
He did this to the intervention of the
only person of Frank's felt was hired in

485
00:29:55,961 --> 00:29:57,250
their king.
The pope,

486
00:29:57,580 --> 00:30:01,750
the pope claimed pepins ascension to
the throne was an act of God and few

487
00:30:01,751 --> 00:30:06,400
therefore contested it and turn Kim Pepin
would give the church lens which will

488
00:30:06,401 --> 00:30:09,760
become the papal states known
as the donation of Pepin.

489
00:30:09,910 --> 00:30:13,720
When Pepin died in seven 68 his
son Charles would succeed him.

490
00:30:13,870 --> 00:30:17,860
Charles the first would become one of
the most important rulers of the age

491
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:21,910
earning the title of the great or
as he is often called Charlemagne.

492
00:30:22,150 --> 00:30:24,340
Charlemagne is sometimes called potter.

493
00:30:24,341 --> 00:30:29,170
I wrote by the father of Europe because
of his many efforts to reinvigorate and

494
00:30:29,171 --> 00:30:33,670
United Europe. After his brother died,
he would unite his Frankish kingdom.

495
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:36,160
He would then invade northern Italy,
Germany,

496
00:30:36,250 --> 00:30:38,050
the Netherlands part of Eastern Europe,

497
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:42,520
and even extend into the Balkans and part
of Spain and above all he would have a

498
00:30:42,521 --> 00:30:44,230
lot of success in doing so.

499
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:49,660
He would fight all throughout his life
to achieve this along with territorial

500
00:30:49,661 --> 00:30:51,100
and political aspirations.

501
00:30:51,130 --> 00:30:56,060
Charlemagne with the support and the
pope was also heavily preoccupied with

502
00:30:56,061 --> 00:30:57,250
spreading Christianity.

503
00:30:57,970 --> 00:31:01,540
Charlemagne insisted that the Saxons
of modern day Germany convert to

504
00:31:01,541 --> 00:31:06,541
Catholicism and those who refused were
killed and one example 4,500 Saxons were

505
00:31:08,051 --> 00:31:12,340
executed and what is remembered as
the massacre of her den. Accordingly,

506
00:31:12,430 --> 00:31:15,310
much of his empire rapidly
became Christianized.

507
00:31:15,610 --> 00:31:20,470
Charlemagne sought not only to expand his
empire but to enlighten it from within

508
00:31:20,471 --> 00:31:21,070
as well.

509
00:31:21,070 --> 00:31:25,120
And so he wasn't concerned only with
bringing political and religious unity to

510
00:31:25,121 --> 00:31:29,860
Europe, but made efforts to restore Europe
to the intellectuals. Social cultural,

511
00:31:29,861 --> 00:31:34,300
infrastructural power of the Roman days
to the point at which his reign is often

512
00:31:34,301 --> 00:31:36,850
called the Carolinian renaissance.

513
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:39,890
He would invite his empire
into a number of counties,

514
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:43,540
a constantly travel throughout Europe
to make sure his subordinates were

515
00:31:43,541 --> 00:31:48,541
following his orders in an age when only
around 1% of the population could read.

516
00:31:48,910 --> 00:31:52,900
Charlemagne insisted education
was a key to revitalizing Europe.

517
00:31:53,230 --> 00:31:57,790
He himself learned how to
read and demanded it of other
officials and statesman.

518
00:31:58,510 --> 00:32:02,770
He built schools across the continent
which increased educational opportunities

519
00:32:02,771 --> 00:32:06,070
not only for the wealthy,
but even the lower classes as well.

520
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:07,960
This fire of learning,

521
00:32:07,961 --> 00:32:11,920
which spread throughout Europe would
help the continent restore trade and

522
00:32:11,921 --> 00:32:12,760
infrastructure.

523
00:32:13,030 --> 00:32:17,430
The Unity Charlemagne had achieved for
the more allowed for disinterested in

524
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:22,060
such things to be realistic again, and
the roads were prioritized and guarded.

525
00:32:22,390 --> 00:32:25,600
Charlemagne had United much
of Europe Christianize.

526
00:32:25,601 --> 00:32:27,820
It brought education and learning to it,

527
00:32:27,850 --> 00:32:32,410
rebuilt its infrastructure and on the
whole improved life for those within his

528
00:32:32,411 --> 00:32:33,190
nation.

529
00:32:33,190 --> 00:32:37,720
On Christmas Day and the year 800 a
Charlemagne knelt at the altar to pray at

530
00:32:37,721 --> 00:32:40,400
mass in Saint Peter's Pope Leo,

531
00:32:40,401 --> 00:32:44,930
the third place a crown on his head
and proclaimed him emperor of Rome.

532
00:32:45,770 --> 00:32:49,190
There is debate actually about whether
or not Charlemagne knew that this was

533
00:32:49,191 --> 00:32:52,220
going to happen.
He later claimed that if he did know,

534
00:32:52,221 --> 00:32:54,200
he wouldn't have even
gone into the church,

535
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:59,300
but most historians find it hard to
believe that he had no idea that this was

536
00:32:59,301 --> 00:33:02,690
going to happen. And in fact, he
didn't exactly dislike the title.

537
00:33:02,691 --> 00:33:04,880
Considering in official documents,

538
00:33:04,910 --> 00:33:09,440
he preferred to be styled Carlis
Serani seamless. I ghost this ideo,

539
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:14,560
not this magnus [inaudible] imperium,

540
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:16,550
meaning Charles Most Serene,

541
00:33:16,551 --> 00:33:21,500
Augustus crowned by God the great
peaceful emperor ruling the Roman Empire,

542
00:33:21,830 --> 00:33:25,760
as one might expect.
The Byzantines were not very fun of this.

543
00:33:25,970 --> 00:33:30,970
They tended to regard western Europeans
as uneducated on civilized barbarian be

544
00:33:31,521 --> 00:33:34,920
surfers, and more importantly,
the empress. Irene,

545
00:33:34,921 --> 00:33:37,440
a Byzantium considered herself.
There were live Rome,

546
00:33:37,460 --> 00:33:39,620
not this Frankish barbarian Charlemagne.

547
00:33:39,950 --> 00:33:44,120
Now this was much more than just
a petty debate over a title.

548
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:49,160
It was another example of strain between
Byzantium and the Catholic Church. This,

549
00:33:49,161 --> 00:33:53,600
along with conflict over land claims
in Italy would lead to a war between

550
00:33:53,601 --> 00:33:55,040
Byzantium and Charlemagne,

551
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:58,910
but it would end with land agreements and
the Byzantines recognizing Charlemagne

552
00:33:58,911 --> 00:34:02,090
as emperor,
though not exactly emperor of Rome.

553
00:34:03,230 --> 00:34:04,520
As time went on,
however,

554
00:34:04,550 --> 00:34:09,470
the divide between east and West would
only deepen what seemed like Europe was

555
00:34:09,471 --> 00:34:11,210
beginning.
A streak of recovery,

556
00:34:11,211 --> 00:34:15,740
external and internal forces will begin
to wreak havoc on Trello means empire.

557
00:34:16,010 --> 00:34:20,630
Western Europe was about to being close
upon on three sides from the south

558
00:34:20,631 --> 00:34:24,800
Islamic north African pirates who begin
rating and plundering southern Europe

559
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:25,511
from the east.

560
00:34:25,511 --> 00:34:30,511
A terrifying wave of nomadic warriors
from Asia known as a Magyars would begin

561
00:34:30,711 --> 00:34:34,760
pushing in and from the north,
perhaps the most fearsome of all,

562
00:34:34,850 --> 00:34:38,780
a group of pagans, Scandinavian
Raiders, known as the Vikings,

563
00:34:38,810 --> 00:34:41,210
would seek plunder and
opportunity in Europe.

564
00:34:41,390 --> 00:34:44,600
Charlemagne would go to war with a
Danish Vikings and eight oh wait,

565
00:34:44,630 --> 00:34:49,340
but made peace and eight 11 I've done
an in depth documentary on the vikings

566
00:34:49,341 --> 00:34:54,050
already on my channel as a matter of fact,
but essentially the vikings were,

567
00:34:54,051 --> 00:34:57,860
as I said, a group of Scandinavian
Raiders from Modern Day Denmark,

568
00:34:57,890 --> 00:35:02,890
Sweden and Norway that is
send it on Europe in the
late 18th century on June 8th

569
00:35:03,410 --> 00:35:08,330
seven 93 on an island known as Linda's
foreign and the Kingdom of Northumbria

570
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:10,610
and Monterey England,
a group of Raiders,

571
00:35:10,611 --> 00:35:15,290
assaulted and undefended Abby slaughtering
and slaving anyone in their way.

572
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:19,550
This was not necessarily the
first viking rate in history,

573
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:24,350
but it is perhaps the most notable as it
marked the beginning of the Viking age

574
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:27,740
terror spread throughout
Europe of the brutal Northmen.

575
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:32,930
Why the Vikings came is still a
matter of debate. The vikings were,

576
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:33,561
as I said,

577
00:35:33,561 --> 00:35:37,860
Pagans and the peg and Saxons who had
been slaughtered by Charlemagne earlier.

578
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:39,480
We're just south of Denmark,

579
00:35:39,481 --> 00:35:43,170
so they may have felt concerned about
the violence spread of Christianity and

580
00:35:43,171 --> 00:35:45,900
they certainly as a result
did not like to Frank's.

581
00:35:46,350 --> 00:35:51,240
There was also perhaps a population boom
at this time in Scandinavia and there

582
00:35:51,241 --> 00:35:54,600
were an excess number of
landless men as a result,

583
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:59,340
and of course it's a constant theme
throughout his Sri that large numbers of

584
00:35:59,341 --> 00:36:02,820
landless jobless young men tend
to go out and cause trouble,

585
00:36:02,910 --> 00:36:07,530
especially when you factor in that there
was potentially a shortage of females

586
00:36:07,531 --> 00:36:10,710
in the region because of
female infanticide at birth.

587
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:15,510
May Norris at the time wanted their
firstborn is to be males. A main factor,

588
00:36:15,511 --> 00:36:17,970
however,
was likely simply because they could.

589
00:36:18,270 --> 00:36:22,710
Europe was becoming wealthier at this
time and opportunity for plunder started

590
00:36:22,711 --> 00:36:26,880
displaying itself, especially on
coastal cities and cities along rivers.

591
00:36:27,180 --> 00:36:29,880
The Vikings,
through their advanced naval technology,

592
00:36:29,881 --> 00:36:34,830
exploited this opportunity attacking coast
and even sailing up rivers with large

593
00:36:34,831 --> 00:36:37,860
groups of men,
namely with the long boat design,

594
00:36:37,861 --> 00:36:40,050
which was unheard of prior to this point.

595
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:44,580
The sailing abilities of the vikings
meant simply nowhere was safe.

596
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:47,310
They could sail inland France and Germany.

597
00:36:47,311 --> 00:36:51,870
They could sail to distant lands going
as far as North Africa and Byzantium,

598
00:36:52,050 --> 00:36:56,940
but their favorite target was right next
to home. The British isles as islands.

599
00:36:56,941 --> 00:37:01,200
Very few locations on the British isles
where more than just a few days march

600
00:37:01,201 --> 00:37:04,020
from the sea and as the
Viking age progressed,

601
00:37:04,230 --> 00:37:07,830
there would be more and more Viking
influence in Britain and Ireland.

602
00:37:08,310 --> 00:37:12,420
A few years later in eight 14
in the face of all this chaos,

603
00:37:12,450 --> 00:37:17,450
Charlemagne died at the age
of 71 Charlemagne had had
four sons and throughout

604
00:37:18,361 --> 00:37:21,720
his life expected he would have
to divide his empire among them.

605
00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:25,650
Unfortunately for him, but fortunately
for the Carolingian Empire,

606
00:37:25,780 --> 00:37:30,240
only one of them, Louis outlived him
and the empire pass to him. However,

607
00:37:30,270 --> 00:37:30,871
regardless,

608
00:37:30,871 --> 00:37:35,640
much of Louise Rain was marked by civil
war and conflict and when he died his

609
00:37:35,641 --> 00:37:37,950
empire was divided among
his sons in a year,

610
00:37:37,951 --> 00:37:42,951
eight 43 three years after his death and
the west of territory would be ruled by

611
00:37:43,021 --> 00:37:45,800
Charles and the East
Louie and in the center.

612
00:37:45,810 --> 00:37:50,400
Loath are these divisions would
form the basis of France, Germany,

613
00:37:50,401 --> 00:37:54,210
and the low countries in such places
that remained to this day that a vision

614
00:37:54,211 --> 00:37:57,780
between these kings only encourage
the enemies of Christian Europe.

615
00:37:58,350 --> 00:38:02,100
The Vikings would increase their rates,
Muslims would increase their plundering.

616
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:04,350
Taking slaves in Luton
such things as well,

617
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:07,530
and the Magyars closed in in some places.

618
00:38:07,531 --> 00:38:12,531
People were hit by all three of these
foes in such times when the central

619
00:38:12,721 --> 00:38:15,360
political figures of Europe
would invited and wore,

620
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:19,710
people would turn to the protection of
the local Nobel's marking some of the

621
00:38:19,711 --> 00:38:22,230
beginnings of standard European feudalism.

622
00:38:22,660 --> 00:38:26,070
In eight 65 the vikings took
a new step to their approach.

623
00:38:26,310 --> 00:38:31,080
A great army of Vikings landed on the
coast of North Umbria and Anglo Saxon

624
00:38:31,081 --> 00:38:36,081
Kingdom and Modern Day England known to
the Anglo Saxons as the great heathen

625
00:38:36,431 --> 00:38:38,350
army.
They did not come to raid,

626
00:38:38,380 --> 00:38:42,020
but in fact to settle gradually
absorbing lands in England,

627
00:38:42,021 --> 00:38:45,070
starting with the city of York,
which they called the orvick.

628
00:38:45,310 --> 00:38:50,200
Gradually the Anglo Saxon lands would fall
to the Dane law. Standing against him,

629
00:38:50,201 --> 00:38:54,760
however, was the ruler of the Kingdom of
Wessex in southern England named Alfred.

630
00:38:55,090 --> 00:38:57,850
In time,
he would become to known as the great.

631
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:01,180
He would spend much of his reign
in conflict with the Vikings,

632
00:39:01,181 --> 00:39:04,810
but he would say the last free
kingdoms of England from Viking role,

633
00:39:05,140 --> 00:39:09,310
though much of the island would remain
under Norse rural for centuries with

634
00:39:09,311 --> 00:39:13,360
Alfred at the head of these kingdoms, he
was style himself, not king of Wessex,

635
00:39:13,390 --> 00:39:18,390
but instead King of England laying the
foundations for things that come in the

636
00:39:18,431 --> 00:39:20,740
late 19th and early 10th centuries,

637
00:39:20,741 --> 00:39:24,310
the Magyars who begin to form a
kingdom and central eastern Europe,

638
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:26,950
a nation which would come
to be known as Hungary.

639
00:39:27,370 --> 00:39:31,510
This kingdom would plunder Europe for
decades to come invading both the western

640
00:39:31,511 --> 00:39:36,460
and eastern world and becoming a specific
nuisance to the East Franks as well as

641
00:39:36,461 --> 00:39:40,630
the Bulgarians and the
Byzantines and nine 55 however,

642
00:39:40,631 --> 00:39:45,460
as the Magyars pressed further into lens
that will become Germany, the king auto,

643
00:39:45,461 --> 00:39:46,930
the first would oppose them.

644
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:52,240
He met them at the battle of Lek felled
that year under autos command was a new

645
00:39:52,241 --> 00:39:54,610
type of soldier,
heavy cavalry,

646
00:39:54,730 --> 00:39:58,660
an important force in standing up
against a horse warriors. The Magyars,

647
00:39:59,110 --> 00:40:03,430
this heavy cavalry would go on to form
the foundation of Medieval Knights.

648
00:40:03,730 --> 00:40:04,570
Auto would win,

649
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:09,220
repelling the Hungarians and in the eyes
of Catholic Europe being an offender of

650
00:40:09,221 --> 00:40:14,221
Christendom as auto continued to work to
unite the German tribes and expand his

651
00:40:14,501 --> 00:40:15,310
empire,

652
00:40:15,310 --> 00:40:19,360
he will be crowned in a similar manner
as Charlemagne by the pope being titled,

653
00:40:19,570 --> 00:40:24,160
Holy Roman Emperor. Thus the holy
Roman empire was born. Meanwhile,

654
00:40:24,190 --> 00:40:27,220
the Vikings often regarded
as destroyers of Europe.

655
00:40:27,370 --> 00:40:32,020
We're in many other ways giving birth
to parts of it and going far beyond what

656
00:40:32,021 --> 00:40:33,220
their opponents were doing.

657
00:40:33,460 --> 00:40:38,170
Many would integrate into European
societies and convert to Catholicism in

658
00:40:38,171 --> 00:40:40,600
France.
In order to appease the vikings,

659
00:40:40,660 --> 00:40:43,810
the king would give them land on
the northern part of the country,

660
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:48,100
which would come to be known as a
land of the north men or Normandy.

661
00:40:48,310 --> 00:40:50,860
These Normans,
after integrating with a French,

662
00:40:50,890 --> 00:40:54,910
would go on to conquer England a century
later and lay the foundations for the

663
00:40:54,911 --> 00:40:58,630
English monarchy. They're having the
greatest naval technology in Europe.

664
00:40:58,690 --> 00:41:02,710
They would go on to explore and
settled distant lands reaching Iceland,

665
00:41:02,740 --> 00:41:04,780
Greenland,
and even North America.

666
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:08,410
Discovering it's centuries before
Columbus and eastern Europe.

667
00:41:08,411 --> 00:41:12,730
The Vikings would come to claim territory
and rule a Slavic people as an ability.

668
00:41:13,420 --> 00:41:17,740
These vikings known as the reus would
lay the foundations for modern Russia,

669
00:41:18,430 --> 00:41:20,620
even as far east as Byzantium,

670
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:25,560
the emperor of Constantinople observing
their military prowess hired them to be

671
00:41:25,561 --> 00:41:28,540
as personal bodyguard known
as the Bahrainian Card.

672
00:41:29,050 --> 00:41:33,710
Ironically the vikings who brought such
darkness in Europe in the what helped

673
00:41:33,711 --> 00:41:37,040
bring it out of that darkness into
the Higher Middle Ages which followed

674
00:41:37,310 --> 00:41:38,450
ultimately.
However,

675
00:41:38,451 --> 00:41:43,310
the truly most unifying force in medieval
Europe for perhaps good and bad was

676
00:41:43,311 --> 00:41:45,410
Christianity and the Catholic Church.

677
00:41:45,650 --> 00:41:49,340
The Catholic Church would stamp out
ideas which contradicted his doctrine,

678
00:41:49,460 --> 00:41:54,020
but it would also be responsible
for encouraging a return
of education to Europe.

679
00:41:54,380 --> 00:41:57,890
The church would heavily persecute
those who did not fall into the line of

680
00:41:57,891 --> 00:42:02,090
thought, but oftentimes that meant
persecuting rapists, thieves,

681
00:42:02,091 --> 00:42:04,220
murderers and other nefarious people.

682
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:08,030
Leaders would be held under a degree
of rule from the Catholic church,

683
00:42:08,060 --> 00:42:12,350
which was an plenty of circumstances,
a self interested organization.

684
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:16,940
The Catholic Church was also instrumental
in restricting self interested rulers

685
00:42:16,941 --> 00:42:21,200
and ability and held them to a
standard of decency and morality.

686
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:25,100
The Catholic Church would encourage
the code of chivalry among Europeans,

687
00:42:25,101 --> 00:42:29,720
which turned the medieval knight from a
barbarian thug into a servant of piety

688
00:42:29,721 --> 00:42:30,554
and morality.

689
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:34,730
We can debate the effects that religion
and especially religious organizations

690
00:42:34,731 --> 00:42:37,970
have on people,
especially in times like the dark ages,

691
00:42:37,971 --> 00:42:42,350
and we can even call into question how
much good and bad that the Catholic

692
00:42:42,350 --> 00:42:46,130
Church did in his time was really in
the name of religion or if it was out of

693
00:42:46,131 --> 00:42:48,890
his self interested plot.
But in the end,

694
00:42:48,891 --> 00:42:52,760
I think it would be fair to say that
the Catholic Church played a significant

695
00:42:52,761 --> 00:42:55,370
role of bringing Europe
out of the dark ages,

696
00:42:55,820 --> 00:43:00,820
even if that role was not wholly good
or bad in the eyes of some historians,

697
00:43:00,890 --> 00:43:05,120
Europe would not return to the same level
of appreciation and dignity until the

698
00:43:05,121 --> 00:43:08,720
renaissance. But around the
beginning of the 11th century,

699
00:43:08,900 --> 00:43:12,980
the dark age of the Medieval world
was coming to a close trade and

700
00:43:12,981 --> 00:43:16,850
infrastructure where we're turning to
former grander art and architecture.

701
00:43:16,851 --> 00:43:20,750
Took off modern nation states,
notably England, France,

702
00:43:20,780 --> 00:43:22,070
Poland in Denmark,

703
00:43:22,310 --> 00:43:27,200
saw their foundations in his time and
with those nations can the concept of the

704
00:43:27,201 --> 00:43:31,390
state and the power which they would
come to wield the first crusades,

705
00:43:31,430 --> 00:43:35,570
would reintroduce Europe to
the intellectual achievements
of antiquity and the

706
00:43:35,571 --> 00:43:36,800
Islamic golden age,

707
00:43:36,950 --> 00:43:41,090
which were crucial in pulling Europe from
the Middle Ages all together and into

708
00:43:41,091 --> 00:43:43,070
the modern world.
The modern world,

709
00:43:43,071 --> 00:43:47,330
which by the 11th and 12th centuries
was beginning to come into sight.

710
00:43:48,260 --> 00:43:51,890
As for the Roman Empire,
it would never truly rise again.

711
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:56,540
The Byzantine Empire would survive until
the 15th century when Constantinople

712
00:43:56,541 --> 00:44:00,710
was finally captured by the
Muslim Ottoman Empire in Europe,

713
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:04,970
many from the holy Roman Empire to
Napoleonic France to Mussolini's,

714
00:44:04,971 --> 00:44:08,180
Italy would claim to be the
return of the Roman Empire.

715
00:44:08,630 --> 00:44:10,640
And though none would ever be truly Roman,

716
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:13,730
the legacy of the Romans would
last up to the modern day.

717
00:44:13,970 --> 00:44:18,050
But while Rome laid the foundations for
much of Europe and significant parts of

718
00:44:18,051 --> 00:44:19,010
the world,
in fact,

719
00:44:19,130 --> 00:44:23,330
we should not forget that many
other important foundations
lie in the efforts of

720
00:44:23,331 --> 00:44:27,770
the people who push through and survived.
A very dark age at this time.

721
