1
00:00:03,170 --> 00:00:04,003
Oh there,

2
00:00:06,490 --> 00:00:09,640
it's October and that means at the
end of the month, Halloween is coming,

3
00:00:09,641 --> 00:00:13,060
but when you think about it,
Halloween is kind of a weird holiday.

4
00:00:13,061 --> 00:00:16,900
It's centered around the dead,
the monsters to creepy and things.

5
00:00:16,901 --> 00:00:18,870
We generally find unpleasant.

6
00:00:20,110 --> 00:00:24,160
We carve faces into pumpkins
and put candles and then
we decorate our houses and

7
00:00:24,161 --> 00:00:26,770
more costumes relevant
to this holidays purpose.

8
00:00:27,190 --> 00:00:30,910
It's the one time of year kids
can get candy from strangers.

9
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:35,560
What is going on here? Well,
for the origins of Halloween,

10
00:00:35,561 --> 00:00:39,160
we'd have to go back to at least
700 BC to the Council of Europe,

11
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:41,590
specifically Ireland, Scotland, Wales,

12
00:00:41,591 --> 00:00:46,360
and Gaul and the Celtic festival of
saw when or shop and he spelled s.

13
00:00:46,361 --> 00:00:51,310
A. M. H. A. I. N. It's a Celtic word
and it has a very pronunciations.

14
00:00:52,330 --> 00:00:54,400
Often I hear it pronounced saw one.
However,

15
00:00:54,401 --> 00:00:56,320
with my understanding
of the Irish language,

16
00:00:56,321 --> 00:00:58,870
I would personally pronounce it Shaaban.
Anyway,

17
00:00:58,871 --> 00:01:03,520
sanguine or shoving occurred on the night
of October 31st and the early morning

18
00:01:03,521 --> 00:01:08,230
of November 1st it was celebrated as a
middle between the RM equinox and the

19
00:01:08,231 --> 00:01:12,460
winter solstice and it was celebrated
as the end of the harvest and as a pagan

20
00:01:12,461 --> 00:01:16,330
religious holiday
and fires were lit up just

21
00:01:16,330 --> 00:01:17,500
as they are today on Halloween.

22
00:01:17,501 --> 00:01:21,430
Sometimes cows were started for their meat
for the winter and a festival is held.

23
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:23,980
Alcohol was consumed.
In fact,

24
00:01:23,981 --> 00:01:27,730
it is notable to say that Merce
stories in Vulcan alcohol begin on saw.

25
00:01:27,731 --> 00:01:31,360
I went in Irish mythology and legends.
However,

26
00:01:31,361 --> 00:01:33,520
Shovin had a darker side to it.

27
00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:37,330
The cat's believed in other worlds.

28
00:01:37,331 --> 00:01:40,840
I was sort of their own and occasionally
these worlds were open between each

29
00:01:40,841 --> 00:01:43,900
other. People venture into these
other worlds. After her death,

30
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:47,500
other times the living could
wander in and come out alive.

31
00:01:48,490 --> 00:01:51,130
The mythology of these worlds
tends to vary from tried to try,

32
00:01:51,131 --> 00:01:54,970
but some other worlds were very pleasant,
others were very dark.

33
00:01:56,380 --> 00:01:59,180
These other worlds.
We're open to many times in legend,

34
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,630
but we're open specifically on two nights,

35
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:06,220
the night of Belton occurring and the
night before May 1st centered around the

36
00:02:06,221 --> 00:02:11,221
living and sobbing occurring on the
night before November 1st it's centered

37
00:02:11,471 --> 00:02:15,250
around the dead.
Shaaban was as somewhat dangerous night,

38
00:02:15,251 --> 00:02:18,100
but they're always been not celebrate
with literacy and take precautions to

39
00:02:18,101 --> 00:02:23,020
protect themselves as on this night dark
spirits to roam the countryside at the

40
00:02:23,021 --> 00:02:25,900
barriers between the realm to the
living and the dead were broke.

41
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:28,860
These dark spirits were known as the ash.

42
00:02:28,861 --> 00:02:32,680
She on fire served many
purposes and that mythology,

43
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:35,050
one of which was to
drive away these as she.

44
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:39,790
Some people would attempt to appease
these spirits by leaving food and drink

45
00:02:39,791 --> 00:02:44,410
outside of their home for any of that
might pass by perhaps one origin of trick

46
00:02:44,411 --> 00:02:49,030
or treating and others would attempt
to scare the spirits off by wearing

47
00:02:49,031 --> 00:02:50,930
intimidating and flight for costume.

48
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,530
Another customs surviving these days
later when the Romans conquered modern,

49
00:02:56,531 --> 00:02:57,220
they France,

50
00:02:57,220 --> 00:03:02,220
which was in largely occupied by nerve
traditions mixed and became associated

51
00:03:02,441 --> 00:03:06,010
with the Roman festival of Kimono
celebrating the Apple Harvest.

52
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:11,010
And the origin of apple bobbing and
even picked up on some Roman traditions

53
00:03:11,291 --> 00:03:16,270
involving the debt which also held the
fires and drove off evil spirits and had

54
00:03:16,271 --> 00:03:20,350
similar ideas of honoring the dead but
Roman traditions involving the dead

55
00:03:20,351 --> 00:03:22,870
removed from February
to the end of October.

56
00:03:24,490 --> 00:03:28,630
Eventually though Christianity spread of
the calcium a place many of their pagan

57
00:03:28,631 --> 00:03:32,710
traditions, some Celtic Pagan holidays
were destroyed by the new religion.

58
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:35,380
Others were converted into
Christian celebrations.

59
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:40,650
Siteone is an oh off the bladder becoming
all hallows eve or holy evening in the

60
00:03:41,391 --> 00:03:45,340
17 hundreds of Scottish began shorting
the phrase all hallows youth assembly

61
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:48,220
Halloween this weekend,
the partner,

62
00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:50,750
the word for the holiday and
it's spread throughout Europe.

63
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:55,250
The three day religious period of all
hallow tie and Christianity and involved

64
00:03:55,251 --> 00:03:58,720
in many customers are evolving the
civically around honoring the debt

65
00:03:58,990 --> 00:04:02,260
specifically those are good
heart and the Christian faith.

66
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:05,050
It involved abstinence from me.

67
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:08,890
Lighting candles for the
deceased consecrating graders
was only water or milk

68
00:04:08,891 --> 00:04:12,790
and many other traditions and customs
which varied and in fact still vary from

69
00:04:12,791 --> 00:04:16,180
country to country. However,
in the Celtic nations,

70
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:20,200
the legend of the ashy and the traditions
of shower when we're not entirely lost

71
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:24,700
in many practices and traditions continued
and evolved into their modern forms

72
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:28,780
and Scotland. Children went
around them. It can these spirits,

73
00:04:28,781 --> 00:04:32,890
but painted faces in costumes demanding
to be welcomed by strangers and to be

74
00:04:32,891 --> 00:04:36,900
given treats or else they would
play a trick on their victims.

75
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:38,321
Eventually,

76
00:04:38,321 --> 00:04:43,150
this became more common right Cole and
expected this trick or treating spread to

77
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:45,280
England and in America
in the 20th century,

78
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:49,480
they have tradition of carving
faces into vegetables. Specifically.

79
00:04:49,481 --> 00:04:53,560
Turnips also continued to this time and
included eliminating them by placing

80
00:04:53,561 --> 00:04:57,880
candles inside them related to the
legends of the word of the WISC or Jack of

81
00:04:57,881 --> 00:05:02,080
the lantern, the legend of
jack-o-lantern. It's that of Stingy Jack.

82
00:05:02,081 --> 00:05:03,910
When invited the devil to
have a drink with them.

83
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:06,940
He made a deal and a few mistakes,
but the apple,

84
00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:10,870
which led to neither God nor the devil
wanting him in their realm upon his death,

85
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:16,500
the devil giving him a piece of coal tells
him to find his own health and as one

86
00:05:16,631 --> 00:05:19,170
or the earth with a lid,
piece of call instead of carbs.

87
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:23,370
Fair enough.
Since the Celts card faces in the turnips,

88
00:05:23,371 --> 00:05:24,630
which were lit similarly,

89
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:27,870
both to commemorate the legends
and the scare off Stingy Jack,

90
00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:30,300
though when they came to America,

91
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:34,560
the Irish found the pumpkin made for a
much more decorative and affective fruit

92
00:05:34,561 --> 00:05:37,800
for design.
Hence the creation of the Jack o lantern.

93
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:42,690
The large number of Irish immigrants
brought Halloween to the USA and Canada.

94
00:05:42,691 --> 00:05:46,290
Where does a huge additional and
commercial event today becoming bigger?

95
00:05:46,291 --> 00:05:50,760
There isn't perhaps the Celtic nations
from which it originated. However,

96
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:54,210
Halloween wasn't finished
there in the Victorian era.

97
00:05:54,211 --> 00:05:56,970
Gothic literature assembly
came wildly popular.

98
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:01,940
Dark Tales of the undead core scenes
of the macabre and uncomfortable were

99
00:06:01,941 --> 00:06:05,270
invented and thrilled to readers
across Europe and North America.

100
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:08,480
Stories like Bram Stoker's Dracula.

101
00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:13,010
I trust that your journey from London
has been a happy one and that you will

102
00:06:13,011 --> 00:06:16,790
enjoy your stain. My beautiful
man, you want a friend

103
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,520
Mary Shelley's Frankenstein,

104
00:06:21,010 --> 00:06:25,390
you will rejoice to you that no disaster
has accompanied the commencements of an

105
00:06:25,391 --> 00:06:29,220
enterprise which you have
regarded with such eel for boating

106
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,870
and the works of Edgar Allen Poe.

107
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:37,070
The red death devastated the country.

108
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:42,660
No pestilence ever been so fatal or so
hideous influenced Halloween's identity

109
00:06:45,141 --> 00:06:50,030
much for it and the 20th century more
aspects of religious practice and

110
00:06:50,031 --> 00:06:55,031
fascination with the gothic light
continue to influence Halloween until it

111
00:06:55,251 --> 00:07:00,251
reached its great popularity in western
and even world cultures they'll be

112
00:07:00,321 --> 00:07:03,500
getting as a pagan holiday and
later as a Christian holiday.

113
00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:08,720
It is viewed now mostly as a time of fun
and a positive expression of a darker

114
00:07:08,721 --> 00:07:10,910
side of the human mind and experience.

115
00:07:11,570 --> 00:07:16,010
Some religious groups believe Halloween
to be an event of say 10 a ritual at the

116
00:07:16,011 --> 00:07:20,390
majority of Christians believe neither
Halloween north saw when to be as such.

117
00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:21,650
And many people,

118
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:26,680
even non Christians and
even non Westerners readily
celebrate the holidays with

119
00:07:26,690 --> 00:07:27,523
mistake.

120
00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:33,010
And so the event of Halloween was forge
of the course of 2,500 years by calts,

121
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:37,580
Romans, early and modern Europeans and
North Americans as well as other groups

122
00:07:38,030 --> 00:07:41,800
influenced by both pagan and Christian
religious aspects as well as shadow

123
00:07:41,801 --> 00:07:45,230
religion legend and chilling literature
and media such as the gothic tales from

124
00:07:45,231 --> 00:07:50,070
the Victorian era as well as a whore
and books and films and imagination up

125
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:53,780
today. To recap, the wearing of costumes,

126
00:07:53,810 --> 00:07:57,770
the decoration of houses and bonfires and
such were originally designed to scare

127
00:07:57,771 --> 00:08:02,180
off the dark spirits and Celtic mythology
known as the s she trick or treating.

128
00:08:02,181 --> 00:08:05,170
It comes from children pretending to be
these spirits by dressing up as I'm an

129
00:08:05,171 --> 00:08:05,891
orthopedic Stuart.

130
00:08:05,891 --> 00:08:10,730
The items left but these
spirits by threatening tricks
if they weren't received

131
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:13,850
bobbing for apples came
from Roman traditions.

132
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:17,150
Pumpkin carving dates back to the
legend of Jack of the lantern,

133
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:20,960
originally associated with a turnip until
the Irish found the Pumpkin in North

134
00:08:20,961 --> 00:08:24,590
America.
Bonfires candles and even setting a place.

135
00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:28,460
The Table For the CCE relatives on the
Snyder also originated from Catholic and

136
00:08:28,461 --> 00:08:30,830
Christian religious
practices honoring the dead

137
00:08:32,590 --> 00:08:36,620
already law all over. You're choosing to
celebrate it. Our warming work is zero.

138
00:08:36,621 --> 00:08:41,540
Happy Halloween for more videos
on holidays and many other topics,

139
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:44,510
I'd invite a check out my channel.
Thank you for watching.

140
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:45,493
Okay.

141
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:54,530
Yeah.
