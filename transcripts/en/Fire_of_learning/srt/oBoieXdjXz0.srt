00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:01,740
Hello and welcome to fire of learning.

2
00:00:02,020 --> 00:00:05,670
And this video we are going to be
talking about the NFC intuitive feelers

3
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:09,030
intuitors you will notice are moderately
different compared to those sensory

4
00:00:09,031 --> 00:00:12,870
counterparts. Now even though nos and NTDs
are only one fourth of the population,

5
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:16,620
I'd bet the majority of you watching this
tested and because Meyers Briggs type

6
00:00:16,621 --> 00:00:20,190
psychology is a topic which
tends to attract intuitive types.

7
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:25,320
And in this video we'll be focusing
again on the NFS, the IFP, the NFP,

8
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:27,210
the I of Jay and the enf Jay.

9
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:30,810
Now you'll notice s's are divided
between perceiving and judging,

10
00:00:30,811 --> 00:00:34,950
P and j whereas ends are divided
between thinking and feeling. T and f.

11
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:38,820
Y will, I'm not entirely sure why
this is the common way of doing it.

12
00:00:38,821 --> 00:00:42,810
It seems unnecessary as having intuitive
perceivers and intuitive judges would

13
00:00:42,811 --> 00:00:43,920
be equally sufficient.

14
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:48,620
But I will say though that even though
as you will see an J's and nps calve

15
00:00:48,621 --> 00:00:50,970
considerably different
functions stack just as the SS,

16
00:00:51,330 --> 00:00:54,960
how they appear on the surface and the
kind of habits, interests, lifestyles,

17
00:00:54,961 --> 00:00:57,240
et cetera that they develop
are moderately similar.

18
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:00,000
So what's the big deal about
the end as divide? Well,

19
00:01:00,001 --> 00:01:03,060
as usual we'll get to the cognitive
function explanation and a bed,

20
00:01:03,061 --> 00:01:06,510
but for now will be sufficient to
say that like all ends and s are more

21
00:01:06,511 --> 00:01:11,160
interested in sort of what if or abstract
concepts and possibilities they may

22
00:01:11,161 --> 00:01:13,980
trust there in to feelings over what
their senses are telling them and they're

23
00:01:13,981 --> 00:01:17,670
particularly good at reading between
the lines and information of whatever

24
00:01:17,671 --> 00:01:21,660
nature or a sensors can see if things by
starting with facts and then forming a

25
00:01:21,661 --> 00:01:25,440
larger picture and try to grasp the whole
picture at once and then work out the

26
00:01:25,441 --> 00:01:29,730
components and like all F's feelers ns
prefer to make decisions and judge things

27
00:01:29,731 --> 00:01:32,970
in accordance with the system of morals
and values which they focus on a polling

28
00:01:32,971 --> 00:01:36,540
and refining throughout their lives and
will often aspire to curry conditions

29
00:01:36,541 --> 00:01:41,460
which are fair and equitable for everyone
or an essence create harmony as I've

30
00:01:41,461 --> 00:01:44,970
stressed feeling and Myers Briggs,
it's not equate to emotions.

31
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:48,900
Afs may have a greater focus on emotions
and in fact a better understanding of

32
00:01:48,901 --> 00:01:49,470
them.

33
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:53,100
But the irony is that thinkers may at
times be worse at handling their emotions,

34
00:01:53,101 --> 00:01:56,850
but more on that later and F's are
usually bright, caring, friendly,

35
00:01:56,851 --> 00:01:58,560
sociable and creative people.

36
00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:02,160
They will often place emphasis on human
relationships and interactions both on

37
00:02:02,161 --> 00:02:05,820
the small and large scale from the
people close to them to a larger social

38
00:02:05,821 --> 00:02:08,130
picture constituting the
relations of humankind.

39
00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:11,610
No often place great emphasis
on ideals and values.

40
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:15,150
So the values developed by intuitive
feelers are not always necessarily in

41
00:02:15,151 --> 00:02:17,550
accordance with common
or traditional values.

42
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:21,330
They will often more independently
develop an idea of how society should

43
00:02:21,331 --> 00:02:25,230
interact and exist and in fact in abuse
society's values as short sighted,

44
00:02:25,231 --> 00:02:30,210
shallow and a moral being particularly
critical of hypocrisy in consistency and

45
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:31,290
inauthenticity.

46
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:34,860
These traits may encourage them to be
somewhat rebellious and to become active

47
00:02:34,861 --> 00:02:38,460
in movements of other conservation
of some things or a change in others.

48
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:41,950
This is not the say that they're stubborn
or and flexible like most theaters

49
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:44,720
there are generally friendly and easy
going and only become combative and

50
00:02:44,721 --> 00:02:47,160
certain lines across. They do, however,

51
00:02:47,161 --> 00:02:49,110
expect themselves to
adhere to these morals.

52
00:02:49,111 --> 00:02:52,470
Very strongly believe that doing so is
it necessary in their quest to connect

53
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:55,800
with their inner selves or to find
their place in the world. However,

54
00:02:55,801 --> 00:02:57,780
in relation to the people they care about,

55
00:02:57,781 --> 00:03:00,880
they will often try to see the best and
then there will be more likely to reach

56
00:03:00,881 --> 00:03:05,350
out and help them then to be accessibly
critical and order them we could say and

57
00:03:05,351 --> 00:03:06,490
to shape.
However,

58
00:03:06,491 --> 00:03:10,540
when stressed or otherwise unhealthy
and F's May become selfish, defensive,

59
00:03:10,541 --> 00:03:12,700
argumentative,
impulsive or unreasonable,

60
00:03:12,850 --> 00:03:15,490
they may switch from attempted to see
the best and others to seeing all the

61
00:03:15,491 --> 00:03:17,310
negative aspects of people on society.

62
00:03:17,311 --> 00:03:21,040
Seeing the core of humanity is being
shallow, helpless, and inherently corrupt.

63
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:21,791
Furthermore,

64
00:03:21,791 --> 00:03:25,810
while striving for ideal relations and
circumstances is admirable and useful,

65
00:03:25,811 --> 00:03:28,750
there's subjective value systems and
as IRS for other people may come into

66
00:03:28,751 --> 00:03:32,560
conflict with objective facts,
which NFS may find to be cold,

67
00:03:32,561 --> 00:03:36,970
robotic and inhuman in certain
situations and so usually capable of

68
00:03:36,971 --> 00:03:39,280
understanding logical
reasoning and being logical,

69
00:03:39,281 --> 00:03:42,400
but they may have difficulty in conflicts
in which a logical course of action is

70
00:03:42,401 --> 00:03:46,090
not exactly the most moral or ideal,
especially if it affects others.

71
00:03:46,091 --> 00:03:49,630
They care about. If NFC not ever
come this to may stagnate or in deer,

72
00:03:49,631 --> 00:03:53,260
unnecessary pain in situations such as
unhealthy relationships or unhealthy

73
00:03:53,261 --> 00:03:54,700
employment,
worse,

74
00:03:54,730 --> 00:03:58,060
they may begin to solve problems and
negative ways because I know it's have a

75
00:03:58,061 --> 00:04:00,040
higher sense of others'
feelings and intentions.

76
00:04:00,050 --> 00:04:03,730
Then it become manipulative and coerce
others into things. Most are not though,

77
00:04:03,731 --> 00:04:05,440
especially commonly in most Ns,

78
00:04:05,441 --> 00:04:07,450
come to balance these traits
throughout their lives.

79
00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:11,020
Often they're focused on ideals and their
skill with people and their ability to

80
00:04:11,021 --> 00:04:13,900
grasp the big picture. Well, we'll
try going to subjects like philosophy,

81
00:04:13,901 --> 00:04:17,920
literature, sociology,
politics, psychology, et
cetera. And as you will see,

82
00:04:17,921 --> 00:04:21,310
many notable figures within these fields
throughout history have been an apps.

83
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:24,130
Now, of course, as usual, to
truly understand these types,

84
00:04:24,131 --> 00:04:26,800
we have to look at the cognitive
functions beneath the surface.

85
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:30,630
So here are the four types.
Again, the IFP, the NFP,

86
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:35,170
the inf ga in the enf Jay, and here are
their associated cognitive functions.

87
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:37,930
So as you can see it, like I
said, Ns maybe similar people,

88
00:04:37,931 --> 00:04:40,810
but they opt arrived for
these similarities with
fairly different decision

89
00:04:40,811 --> 00:04:43,120
making preferences at perspectives.
If that makes sense.

90
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:46,840
Essentially the circuitry is a
bit different and as you can see,

91
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:48,010
no shared functions.

92
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:51,490
They're both intuitive feelers because
they're to lead functions are both

93
00:04:51,491 --> 00:04:55,270
intuition and feeling, but they're
opposite focuses. Nfj Is r,

94
00:04:55,271 --> 00:04:58,720
N I and Effie,
introverted intuition and extra feeling.

95
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:04,020
Well NFP is our FII and an e introverted
feeling and extroverted intuition with

96
00:05:04,091 --> 00:05:07,060
their inferior functions.
Likewise of course being opposites.

97
00:05:07,061 --> 00:05:10,240
And of course you see here the flip
flopping of function preferences between

98
00:05:10,241 --> 00:05:12,190
introverts and extroverts
have the same type.

99
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:14,470
So I've said that there are differences,

100
00:05:14,471 --> 00:05:18,680
but the question is what differences
are they? So let's break it down.

101
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:20,770
Starting with the opposite
intuition functions.

102
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:24,670
So what's the difference of the
introverted intuition of NF Ga's and the

103
00:05:24,671 --> 00:05:28,930
extroverted intuition of nfps?
Well, of the four dichotomies,

104
00:05:28,931 --> 00:05:32,140
the difference between an eye in any
is probably the most difficult to

105
00:05:32,141 --> 00:05:35,470
understand. Maybe even the least
solid difference in Myers Briggs,

106
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:39,910
they're both functions focused on
ideas and concepts and possibilities.

107
00:05:39,911 --> 00:05:43,900
But Eni function is more on connecting
concepts if it'll larger picture.

108
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:48,760
Whereas n he is a bit more like idea
generation or brainstorming sort of what

109
00:05:48,761 --> 00:05:52,510
you might expect from what introverted
and extroverted seem to imply.

110
00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:57,260
So I NFJ is and Ian of J's are going to
focus more on tying points together to

111
00:05:57,261 --> 00:06:00,470
reach a single or a more
refined understanding of things.

112
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:04,880
Kind of like a system building process
that may just intuitively know how or why

113
00:06:04,881 --> 00:06:06,140
something is the way it is.

114
00:06:06,141 --> 00:06:09,890
And this may be expressed by moments
where they pause and say something like,

115
00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:13,310
wait a second, I know exactly what's
going on here. Something like that.

116
00:06:13,730 --> 00:06:15,050
And even though the very sociable,

117
00:06:15,051 --> 00:06:19,280
they particularly I fjs may seem to
daydream a lot and seem kind of pensive.

118
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:23,480
All intuitors can be somewhat pensive
and NFJ is of course no exception needing

119
00:06:23,481 --> 00:06:26,210
to sort things out in their head from
time to time, especially introverts.

120
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:30,610
And in he ifps and enf is
however is a bit more random,

121
00:06:30,670 --> 00:06:34,240
not in the sense that nfps have
short attention spans or something.

122
00:06:34,241 --> 00:06:36,790
Often when an NFP gets
interested in something,

123
00:06:36,791 --> 00:06:38,770
they focus on it with a lot of enthusiasm,

124
00:06:39,130 --> 00:06:43,720
but they do kind of jump around from
topic to topic and are very receptive to

125
00:06:43,721 --> 00:06:44,260
new ideas.

126
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:47,380
So much so that they may feel
uncomfortable making up their minds about

127
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:49,600
somethings he nfps who lead with any,

128
00:06:49,601 --> 00:06:52,840
especially because there's always
something new to explore or to do.

129
00:06:52,841 --> 00:06:55,840
They may develop new interests and change
their hobbies within just a few months

130
00:06:55,841 --> 00:06:57,100
and then come back to the much later,

131
00:06:57,101 --> 00:07:00,700
which is a major contributor to why NFP
is are a little bit more bothered by

132
00:07:00,701 --> 00:07:05,110
routine than NF js. They're very good at
brainstorming and ige idea generation,

133
00:07:05,111 --> 00:07:06,340
as I said as well,

134
00:07:06,370 --> 00:07:10,570
and then maybe focused on taking things
and trying to find new ways to do things

135
00:07:10,571 --> 00:07:13,690
with them, which are perhaps
the only new original or random.

136
00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:17,470
We've talked about any before as an
inferior function, but as a lead function,

137
00:07:17,471 --> 00:07:21,340
nfps are usually very good at taking
in something and then asking, well,

138
00:07:21,341 --> 00:07:23,320
what if we do this to it?
What if we make it like this?

139
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:24,910
How about if we change this?
Things like that.

140
00:07:24,911 --> 00:07:28,570
They're very good at
playing with concepts. Now,

141
00:07:28,571 --> 00:07:32,410
the difference in feeling extroverted
feeling versus introverted feeling.

142
00:07:32,411 --> 00:07:36,650
We've talked about introverted feeling
leads before with the ESF p and the s and

143
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:40,320
p and it's essentially the same
function and inf fees, any NFPS,

144
00:07:40,330 --> 00:07:44,620
but the way it's expressed in combination
with intuition is moderately different.

145
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,800
FIS is a function with sort of the
world by a system of values and morals,

146
00:07:47,801 --> 00:07:50,860
which is the NFP people spend their
lives trying to connect with refine and

147
00:07:50,861 --> 00:07:54,440
exhibit and themselves. They're very
aware of their sense of right and wrong.

148
00:07:54,470 --> 00:07:57,490
Keep in mind though that this is a more
independent sense of right and wrong.

149
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:01,330
They may be unusually virtuous expressing
morals that much society would not,

150
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:02,740
or on the other side,

151
00:08:02,741 --> 00:08:07,240
they may develop some fairly crooked
morals and be fairly disagreeable people.

152
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:09,430
They're also very aware
of their own emotions.

153
00:08:09,431 --> 00:08:11,590
Even when they feel
emotional or overwhelmed,

154
00:08:11,591 --> 00:08:15,030
they're usually more aware of what they're
feeling and why and are accordingly

155
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:17,980
more steady in dealing with things
and monitoring their emotions.

156
00:08:17,981 --> 00:08:21,700
Whereas fes can be zero to a hundred
if particular emotions or provoked in a

157
00:08:21,701 --> 00:08:25,450
certain way, but more on Effie
in a second like SFPs. NFP is,

158
00:08:25,451 --> 00:08:27,760
wants to refine their morals
and act in accordance with them,

159
00:08:27,761 --> 00:08:31,210
but while SFPs maybe more focused on
doing this by getting out into the world

160
00:08:31,211 --> 00:08:32,860
and learning how it is,

161
00:08:32,861 --> 00:08:36,820
I guess you could say nfps and combination
with any often prefer to do this with

162
00:08:36,821 --> 00:08:39,160
ideas, concepts, symbols,
metaphor, et cetera.

163
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:41,950
There are a bit philosophic
and how they ponder things.

164
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:43,750
This comes out in a smaller scale.

165
00:08:43,751 --> 00:08:47,290
When NFP is our explaining or arguing
that tend to use a lot of metaphors to

166
00:08:47,291 --> 00:08:50,280
convey their introverted feeling,
reasoning on a larger scale, they'll,

167
00:08:50,281 --> 00:08:52,980
they'll probably take interest in
things like literature, music, arts,

168
00:08:52,981 --> 00:08:56,130
certain sciences, et Cetera.
Literature is a good example.

169
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,920
Both nfps and NFJ is can
be excellent writers,

170
00:08:58,921 --> 00:09:03,760
but a very good example of the Fsi in
any combination inaction is talking and I

171
00:09:03,761 --> 00:09:08,040
NFP and his books more commonly and his
movies at the Lord of the rings Middle

172
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:09,930
Earth is a wonderfully
developed fictional world.

173
00:09:09,931 --> 00:09:13,500
And to credit him much more so than a
lot of popular fictional worlds of our

174
00:09:13,501 --> 00:09:16,740
time. There's histories of
entire fictional civilizations.

175
00:09:16,741 --> 00:09:20,310
He covers a whole history of his world
and detail. He invents languages,

176
00:09:20,311 --> 00:09:21,144
things like that.

177
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:24,510
That kind of thing is at an end you
would just enjoy creating an a level of

178
00:09:24,511 --> 00:09:28,050
creativity that they're fully capable of.
Looking at this story specifically,

179
00:09:28,051 --> 00:09:31,080
it's full of symbolism.
Taking the one ring in particular,

180
00:09:31,081 --> 00:09:34,410
I can symbolize a lot of negative traits
of humankind's such as the desire for

181
00:09:34,411 --> 00:09:38,880
power to the point where
people like Gandalf for
Aragorn or l Ron feel like they

182
00:09:38,881 --> 00:09:43,860
can't handle it. So the task falls on
Frodo, who is by the way, typed as an IFP,

183
00:09:43,890 --> 00:09:45,420
as far as fictional characters go,

184
00:09:45,421 --> 00:09:48,840
which typing fictional characters can
be awkward to do and lead to a lot of

185
00:09:48,841 --> 00:09:49,261
mistakes,

186
00:09:49,261 --> 00:09:53,970
but it falls on him because even though
Frodo is just this little guy from an

187
00:09:53,971 --> 00:09:55,410
uninformed,
unimportant place,

188
00:09:55,710 --> 00:09:59,520
he's courageous and he has unbreakable
virtue and talking obviously implies that

189
00:09:59,521 --> 00:10:02,850
this is the kind of character which is
necessary for human kind of triumph over

190
00:10:02,851 --> 00:10:07,740
evil, which is very, very stereotypical
of NFP writing. But anyway,

191
00:10:07,741 --> 00:10:12,510
that's my nerdy tangent example. Let's
talk about Effie in the NFJ js like f. I.

192
00:10:12,510 --> 00:10:15,480
F he has also expressed differently
an intuitive types and their SFJ

193
00:10:15,481 --> 00:10:17,280
counterparts,
which we talked about before.

194
00:10:17,370 --> 00:10:21,030
If he has a function dedicated toward a
focus on the feelings and intentions of

195
00:10:21,031 --> 00:10:24,210
others. In essence, it's very
focused on people and in fact,

196
00:10:24,211 --> 00:10:28,020
fes may tend to be strongly affected
by how others, especially people,

197
00:10:28,021 --> 00:10:31,050
they care about our feeling to the
point where the emotions of others can

198
00:10:31,051 --> 00:10:34,910
influence their emotions much
more significantly driving
them to try to help out

199
00:10:34,911 --> 00:10:37,440
as accordingly.
I don't mean to be misleading here though.

200
00:10:37,441 --> 00:10:40,140
This is not necessarily mean
that Nfj is are pushovers.

201
00:10:40,141 --> 00:10:42,810
They may accommodate others in
certain ways but maybe very,

202
00:10:42,811 --> 00:10:46,020
very adamant and their principles and
are much more likely to try to convince

203
00:10:46,021 --> 00:10:50,310
people that their position or belief is
right or beneficial rather than silence

204
00:10:50,311 --> 00:10:51,300
it for group harmony.

205
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:55,230
And importantly not all of them want
to be motherly caretakers who just love

206
00:10:55,231 --> 00:10:59,250
everybody and if Jason May be very good
with people enf fjs in particular are

207
00:10:59,251 --> 00:11:02,790
usually good at breaking the ice with
people whereas inf shades are quieter and

208
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,500
further smaller circles and such.

209
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:07,980
But a focus on people and increase
intuitive awareness of their emotions and

210
00:11:07,981 --> 00:11:10,410
attention is not necessarily
mean a love of people.

211
00:11:10,411 --> 00:11:12,480
And in fact from personal experience,

212
00:11:12,481 --> 00:11:16,890
and this is just personal experience I
take with a grain of salt from the NFJ is

213
00:11:16,891 --> 00:11:20,610
I know several of them have expressed
annoyance with how unpleasant the general

214
00:11:20,611 --> 00:11:24,330
people general people can be and
several of them aren't even going into

215
00:11:24,331 --> 00:11:26,670
professions where there'll
be working with people,

216
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:29,850
but combined with their intuitive
sense when they do work with people,

217
00:11:29,851 --> 00:11:31,860
not only are they obviously good at it,

218
00:11:32,010 --> 00:11:34,890
they like it to be for a higher
purpose and this is Austin.

219
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:38,640
What makes them exceptional leaders and
we can see this type of leadership in

220
00:11:38,730 --> 00:11:42,750
leaders like Martin Luther King Jr,
Bernie Sanders, Gandhi, Thomas Jefferson,

221
00:11:42,751 --> 00:11:43,800
et cetera.
All NF.

222
00:11:43,801 --> 00:11:47,610
Jay's despite their ability to help
others are not always good with our own

223
00:11:47,611 --> 00:11:48,061
emotions.

224
00:11:48,061 --> 00:11:51,060
Though it may struggle with their own
feelings and maybe feel they may feel

225
00:11:51,061 --> 00:11:54,330
unappreciated if their efforts going
noticed, if certain lines are crossed.

226
00:11:54,331 --> 00:11:55,480
They may,
as I said,

227
00:11:55,510 --> 00:11:59,860
go to zero to 100 and react very strongly
now for the difference in the thinking

228
00:11:59,861 --> 00:12:01,680
functions and fjs prefer preferred.

229
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:05,080
I interpreted thinking and nfps
preferred Tki, extroverted thinking.

230
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:09,520
Tiaa is a focus on organizing
one's understanding of
the world into an internal

231
00:12:09,521 --> 00:12:10,420
logical framework.

232
00:12:10,421 --> 00:12:13,360
It causes people to try to consistently
refined their understanding of things

233
00:12:13,361 --> 00:12:15,880
and connect them into a
sort of logical system.

234
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:20,470
In NFJ is his function is of course
often superseded by f e and an I,

235
00:12:20,471 --> 00:12:23,620
but Nfj is with a
particularly strong TEI sense,

236
00:12:23,621 --> 00:12:25,870
tend to enjoy logic or puzzles or math.

237
00:12:26,170 --> 00:12:29,560
They may like science or technology
and they're very good at systematizing

238
00:12:29,561 --> 00:12:31,870
things from the perspective of an INTP.

239
00:12:31,871 --> 00:12:34,060
It's always been interesting
to me to see and I,

240
00:12:34,061 --> 00:12:37,930
and t I worked together a sort of
tie in the background systemizing the

241
00:12:37,931 --> 00:12:42,310
intuitions and when you combine this with
f e you may get something like all of

242
00:12:42,311 --> 00:12:44,590
this Myers Briggs types in
the cognitive functions.

243
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:47,290
There is some debate over INTP or inf,

244
00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:50,920
but these two types that can be actually
kind of similar on the surface too,

245
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:53,990
but a lot of people believe
that Carl Young was an Imfj.

246
00:12:54,010 --> 00:12:58,060
Carl Young is of course the psychologist
who developed the cognitive functions

247
00:12:58,061 --> 00:13:01,600
on which Myers Briggs types
are based. T. I also of course,

248
00:13:01,601 --> 00:13:05,620
comes out when NF Ga's are
stressed or when it's encouraged,

249
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:08,320
when they're confronted and arguing
with people who are being excessively

250
00:13:08,321 --> 00:13:11,680
emotional to become very logical and the
response and critical people displaying

251
00:13:11,681 --> 00:13:13,030
extreme emotion for no reason,

252
00:13:13,031 --> 00:13:15,900
especially if it's just
disrupting harmony and fps,

253
00:13:15,930 --> 00:13:17,620
prefer a tee extroverted thinking,

254
00:13:17,621 --> 00:13:21,340
which is of course focused on the
efficient organisation of the external

255
00:13:21,341 --> 00:13:24,910
environment's planning, organizing,
or finding moving things, et cetera.

256
00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:28,270
Even though it is of course superseded
by the more preferred functions.

257
00:13:28,271 --> 00:13:30,070
This of course comes out in multiple ways.

258
00:13:30,071 --> 00:13:33,300
In nfps it comes out and
how they organize things.

259
00:13:33,301 --> 00:13:36,850
I may have sort of moments of enthusiasm
where they want to clean and organize

260
00:13:36,851 --> 00:13:38,440
everything and get things in order.

261
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:42,040
It comes out when they're put into
leadership positions. Not all,

262
00:13:42,041 --> 00:13:46,090
especially I nfps enjoy leadership,
but sometimes they do and when they do,

263
00:13:46,091 --> 00:13:49,690
they made us play organizational behavior
more in accordance with how a key lead

264
00:13:49,691 --> 00:13:50,121
would act.

265
00:13:50,121 --> 00:13:54,150
Then an NFJ would with Evie
using extroverted thinking
to enforce her district

266
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:57,250
justification of fie to
establish an ideal order.

267
00:13:57,430 --> 00:14:00,400
Essentially NFP is tend to
be very relaxed, easy going,

268
00:14:00,401 --> 00:14:03,970
people who are open to suggestions,
which can cause them to be indecisive,

269
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:05,740
but when circumstances require it to,

270
00:14:05,741 --> 00:14:10,741
they'll make decisions represented by a
tee and enter into a kind of TC ob mode.

271
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:11,591
Furthermore,

272
00:14:11,591 --> 00:14:15,580
I can draw them to take
interest in certain things
such as engineering, sciences,

273
00:14:15,581 --> 00:14:17,450
math, computers, law, et Cetera.

274
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:21,610
And is also of course a parents and
teaching and social work positions,

275
00:14:21,611 --> 00:14:25,240
which nfps tend to be attracted to
when confronted with an argument and

276
00:14:25,241 --> 00:14:29,590
sufficiently angry nfps will often express
FII with both any antiquey where they

277
00:14:29,591 --> 00:14:31,030
may try to get to the
bottom line of things,

278
00:14:31,031 --> 00:14:35,320
perhaps very adamantly and say this
is just the way that it has to be or

279
00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:36,183
something like that.

280
00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:41,230
And the final function is
of course sensing and be
for STI and of Shay's prefer

281
00:14:41,231 --> 00:14:46,231
s e s as we focused on more in depth in
the SGA video as a function dedicated

282
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:50,140
toward associating experiences to form a
larger internal framework of why things

283
00:14:50,141 --> 00:14:52,160
happen and what happens
when those things happen.

284
00:14:52,430 --> 00:14:56,060
And as I is accomplished this by being
very focused on specific facts and

285
00:14:56,061 --> 00:14:58,160
details about the things which take place.

286
00:14:58,550 --> 00:15:03,200
Often they will use this function to
support and help develop f. I. N, N, e, I,

287
00:15:03,201 --> 00:15:06,500
n fjs and Enf js prefer s.
E extroverted sensing.

288
00:15:06,501 --> 00:15:09,350
So they may have a tendency to be a
little bit more athletic and coordinated.

289
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:12,350
The may enjoy sports or physical
activities somewhat more than May in

290
00:15:12,351 --> 00:15:15,590
combination with Effie. Feel an urge
to go out and do things with others,

291
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:18,680
may have a fairly good sense of fashion
and they may at times be a little bit

292
00:15:18,681 --> 00:15:20,960
more spontaneous or impulsive.
Now,

293
00:15:20,961 --> 00:15:23,510
an NFP may be a little bit
impulsive sometimes too,

294
00:15:23,511 --> 00:15:27,290
but in many situations they may take a
few seconds to make up their minds about

295
00:15:27,291 --> 00:15:29,000
things,
whereas an Nfj may,

296
00:15:29,001 --> 00:15:32,600
especially if encouraged to be more likely
to just jump right into something and

297
00:15:33,050 --> 00:15:34,970
whether or not that is a
good thing is of course,

298
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:39,440
relative to the individual
and the situation or Clayton.
So in conclusion though,

299
00:15:39,441 --> 00:15:41,990
nfps and NF Jays have
opposite function stacks.

300
00:15:41,991 --> 00:15:44,600
It turned out on the surface
to be somewhat similar. People,

301
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:48,590
they're often likable, intelligent,
independent minded and caring people.

302
00:15:48,650 --> 00:15:52,310
Their ability to grasp large concepts
easily and they're intuitive insight into

303
00:15:52,311 --> 00:15:55,670
the functioning of the world has been
responsible for a great number of positive

304
00:15:55,671 --> 00:16:00,050
and often much needed changes in human
history and their desire to improve

305
00:16:00,051 --> 00:16:01,790
themselves and others
will often lead them,

306
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:06,050
fulfill the role of standard bearer or
lead or encourage others to an ideal on a

307
00:16:06,051 --> 00:16:10,250
small scale such as helping a friend or
resolving a conflict at work or a larger

308
00:16:10,251 --> 00:16:13,640
scale such as leading the way for an
improvement for the whole of society.

309
00:16:13,730 --> 00:16:18,730
And now for some NF statistics and I've
seen general constitutes 16.4% of the u

310
00:16:19,661 --> 00:16:20,690
s population.

311
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:25,780
The NFP mix up 8.1% the I NFP makes up
4.4% the enf j makes up 2.5% and the I

312
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:33,140
NFJ makes up a 1.4% with the inf Jay
being the rarest type of all famous NFP is

313
00:16:33,891 --> 00:16:38,050
include Mark Twain, Alan Watts, Che
Guevara, Robin Williams, and Ellen,

314
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:41,810
the generous famous I NFP is include
Shakespeare's Yung Joc Rousseau,

315
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:46,460
had girl in Kurt Cobain and John Lennon,
famous enf. Jay is included, Cicero,

316
00:16:46,461 --> 00:16:49,790
Barack Obama, Johann von
Gutta, Neil degrasse Tyson,

317
00:16:49,791 --> 00:16:53,780
and Jennifer Lawrence and famous inf
Jay's include Plato and Niels Bohr,

318
00:16:53,781 --> 00:16:56,630
Leon Trotsky, Marilyn
Manson, and Cate Blanchett.

319
00:16:56,690 --> 00:16:59,000
So that's the intuitive
feeler is in a nutshell.

320
00:16:59,001 --> 00:17:01,620
And the next video we're going
to be talking about the Aunties,

321
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:05,660
the intuitive thinkers, and we'll wrap
up the analysis videos. That may be,

322
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:08,030
we might have a few Myers
Briggs videos after that,

323
00:17:08,031 --> 00:17:11,060
but that will be the last of the
analysis videos. And to catch that video,

324
00:17:11,061 --> 00:17:13,670
and for more videos like that
and on many other subjects,
