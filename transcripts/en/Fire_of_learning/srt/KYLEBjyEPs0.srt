Hello and welcome the fire of learning
and the next few videos we're going to be

2
00:00:03,721 --> 00:00:06,210
doing an overview of what is it called,
the Viking age.

3
00:00:06,211 --> 00:00:10,020
The Viking age began in the late eighth
century and lasted until the mid 11th

4
00:00:10,021 --> 00:00:10,471
century,

5
00:00:10,471 --> 00:00:14,070
marked by the beginning of raids on
neighboring settlements by Norris Raiders

6
00:00:14,071 --> 00:00:16,980
and known as the Vikings.
The word Viking,

7
00:00:16,981 --> 00:00:19,080
very likely is it related to plundering,

8
00:00:19,081 --> 00:00:23,310
exploring and or adventuring their
influence on European society.

9
00:00:23,311 --> 00:00:27,120
Language and culture was a major having
lasting effects which influence us to

10
00:00:27,121 --> 00:00:27,930
this day.

11
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:32,520
They were in many ways an early medieval
power influencing societies from Spain

12
00:00:32,521 --> 00:00:37,110
to southern Italy to Russia and feared
and known all the way from Canada to the

13
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:37,470
Middle East.

14
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:41,040
They're sea fairing
abilities and exploratory
accomplishments predate the rest

15
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:44,700
of Europe, hundreds of years settling
places like Greenland, Iceland,

16
00:00:44,701 --> 00:00:48,600
and discovering and even colonizing
North America hundreds of years before

17
00:00:48,601 --> 00:00:50,520
Christopher Columbus was even born.

18
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:53,520
They were an accomplished but
also misunderstood people.

19
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:56,520
As much of what we know about them came
from accounts from their enemies and

20
00:00:56,521 --> 00:00:59,970
therefore much work has been done in
dispelling many misconceptions and false

21
00:00:59,971 --> 00:01:00,780
ideas.

22
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:04,260
Considering the fact that a lot of
misinformation about vikings exist here,

23
00:01:04,261 --> 00:01:06,180
even on other channels on Youtube,

24
00:01:06,181 --> 00:01:10,380
I've been extra careful to
avoid information that is
in factual. In this video,

25
00:01:10,381 --> 00:01:13,920
we're going to talk about the history
of Scandinavia leading up to the Viking

26
00:01:13,921 --> 00:01:17,010
age and a number of events occurring
in their homeland and in Europe,

27
00:01:17,011 --> 00:01:20,220
which have very likely contributed
and caused the Viking age.

28
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:23,880
The Vikings came from the region
known today as Scandinavia,

29
00:01:23,881 --> 00:01:26,520
which today is Denmark,
Sweden, and Norway.

30
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:29,880
This region had historically
been occupied by dramatic tribes.

31
00:01:29,881 --> 00:01:33,570
Many of these tribes went on to evolve
into the north societies at the vikings

32
00:01:33,571 --> 00:01:37,230
came from during the time of the Roman
of the region was largely cut off from

33
00:01:37,231 --> 00:01:39,330
the Roman empire being
separated by Germany,

34
00:01:39,331 --> 00:01:43,050
which successfully repelled room invasions
and halted their desire to expansion

35
00:01:43,051 --> 00:01:44,100
northward.
However,

36
00:01:44,101 --> 00:01:47,610
archeological evidence proves that Roman
goods did make their way into lower

37
00:01:47,611 --> 00:01:51,390
Scandinavia and tribes from their
region did at times participate in wars

38
00:01:51,391 --> 00:01:52,290
against the Romans,

39
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:56,190
particularly those from modern Denmark
being mixed in with the other nearby

40
00:01:56,191 --> 00:01:59,460
Germanic tribes.
The people here were fairly interesting.

41
00:01:59,461 --> 00:02:01,860
They had somewhat
democratic tribal societies.

42
00:02:01,861 --> 00:02:05,440
In which all land owning men and in fact
the land owning women without a husband

43
00:02:05,441 --> 00:02:06,031
to present them.

44
00:02:06,031 --> 00:02:10,110
How does say in the tribe a system which
didn't really change until the later

45
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:12,450
iron age when we're like kings
began to take over the society,

46
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:15,900
Kingswood later support the material
wealth of their societies by plundering

47
00:02:15,901 --> 00:02:16,860
others.
However,

48
00:02:16,861 --> 00:02:20,190
even in these societies in Norris had
a democratic undertone to their culture

49
00:02:20,191 --> 00:02:23,280
and society and many land owners in
North Society's believes that they should

50
00:02:23,281 --> 00:02:27,570
have a say in their chiefs in or later
kings decisions following the fall of the

51
00:02:27,571 --> 00:02:28,470
Roman empire.

52
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:32,340
The peoples of this area enter into
what's called the Germanic irony age.

53
00:02:32,341 --> 00:02:35,790
And notably this is the same time
period in which the Danes Appearance

54
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:35,940
Scandinavia.

55
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:39,810
The Danes spoke a similar Norse language
as that of other tribes in places like

56
00:02:39,811 --> 00:02:40,830
Sweden and Norway.

57
00:02:40,831 --> 00:02:44,280
And they sell them parts of both of
these places in northern Germany and of

58
00:02:44,281 --> 00:02:48,390
course for the most part, the Danish
march or what is today called Denmark.

59
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:52,860
So these north societies begin to take
shape and evolve in such and eventually

60
00:02:52,861 --> 00:02:57,540
the people here have an urge to expand.
And explore and migrate to new places,

61
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:01,840
but people here began to build great
warships, develop newer technologies,

62
00:03:01,841 --> 00:03:05,260
and began raiding various places
and even eventually settling,

63
00:03:05,261 --> 00:03:09,970
knew previously undiscovered lands, thus
marking the beginning of the Viking age.

64
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:12,820
But the question is why.
I mean to be fair,

65
00:03:12,821 --> 00:03:16,840
Scandinavia wasn't exactly the spotlight
of your prior to this point in history.

66
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:21,340
What reasons and events drove them to
begin this highly influential Viking age?

67
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:24,790
Well, a number of things were going on
at this time in Europe and very likely a

68
00:03:24,791 --> 00:03:28,390
combination of factors contributed
to the sparking of this age.

69
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:33,100
One factor is possibly that Scandinavia
at this time was becoming overpopulated.

70
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:37,540
Scandinavia is a cold and not particularly
fertile region and this of course is

71
00:03:37,541 --> 00:03:41,650
place limitations on agriculture and
general food production and obviously the

72
00:03:41,651 --> 00:03:43,840
population might have
been restricted by this.

73
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:47,530
This is something which
stuck with a Scandinavian
nations throughout history and

74
00:03:47,531 --> 00:03:50,470
even today, their populations
are still comparatively smaller.

75
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:54,610
It's entirely likely that people having
such a region want to go out and raid

76
00:03:54,611 --> 00:03:57,880
other societies for resources and
eventually settled out other areas.

77
00:03:57,881 --> 00:04:00,670
It wasn't necessarily that they
were just sick of the weather.

78
00:04:00,671 --> 00:04:03,100
Some of these places like
Iceland and Greenland,

79
00:04:03,101 --> 00:04:05,470
we're not much more a
group of apple climates,

80
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:08,920
but they were open territories with land
available for set for settlement and

81
00:04:08,921 --> 00:04:12,460
the vikings were interested
in that especially because
it was an opportunity to

82
00:04:12,461 --> 00:04:15,910
get away from the burdens of Viking
kings in politics and as such have their

83
00:04:15,911 --> 00:04:20,140
home nations and politics based on the
Viking accounts were definitely motive

84
00:04:20,141 --> 00:04:21,640
for emigration.
However,

85
00:04:21,641 --> 00:04:26,230
there isn't much evidence to support the
idea that there was a famine occurring

86
00:04:26,231 --> 00:04:27,640
in Scandinavia at this time.

87
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:30,880
There may have indeed been enough for
the population to get by. However,

88
00:04:30,881 --> 00:04:35,680
there may have been some problems with
the population itself in North Society at

89
00:04:35,681 --> 00:04:36,131
the time,

90
00:04:36,131 --> 00:04:39,700
there was a heavy emphasis on having
male children to the point at which,

91
00:04:39,701 --> 00:04:42,520
and fantasize sometimes occurred
towards female children.

92
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:45,820
This while being sad and cruel and
itself was likely responsible for an

93
00:04:45,821 --> 00:04:48,730
imbalance in the sexism.
Many norths men were motivated,

94
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:52,930
motivated to find wives and begin families
and other lands where there were more

95
00:04:52,931 --> 00:04:54,010
women.
However,

96
00:04:54,011 --> 00:04:57,610
the fact that they didn't just go and
bring women back kind of suggests that

97
00:04:57,611 --> 00:04:59,860
this was not the main
driving force either.

98
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:04,810
Another major event to take
into consideration here
is that the beginning of

99
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:07,540
this age occurs at the same time
as both Charlotte, his empire,

100
00:05:07,541 --> 00:05:09,580
and the increased spread of Christianity.

101
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:12,880
The Nourse who were pagans were very
concerned about the Frankish empire,

102
00:05:12,881 --> 00:05:14,410
the Franks being the early French,

103
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:18,190
especially as the empire went right on
their southern border and some conflict

104
00:05:18,191 --> 00:05:21,790
occurred, especially as Christianity
spread throughout Scandinavia.

105
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:25,570
The North's peoples were rather
abrasive to Christianity. In fact,

106
00:05:25,571 --> 00:05:29,620
that Christian forces often simply killed
Scandinavians who refuse to convert to

107
00:05:29,621 --> 00:05:32,560
the religion, did not encourage
them to change their perspective.

108
00:05:32,590 --> 00:05:35,830
Many people believe that the vikings
may have felt compelled to defend their

109
00:05:35,831 --> 00:05:39,220
societies and religion and general
way of life from the foreign threats,

110
00:05:39,221 --> 00:05:43,030
and even though Charlemagne's empire
began to decline heavily after his death,

111
00:05:43,150 --> 00:05:46,980
they may have pursued this defensiveness
and use it as justification during the

112
00:05:46,981 --> 00:05:50,800
Viking age, especially
because Christianity did
not go away. Another motive,

113
00:05:50,801 --> 00:05:54,280
quite simply is just that they
may have known that they could,

114
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:57,290
they were developing new technologies,
specifically better tools,

115
00:05:57,291 --> 00:06:00,800
weapons and warships. They were
becoming a more organized society,

116
00:06:00,801 --> 00:06:03,680
and importantly, some of their
neighbors were weak, fragmented,

117
00:06:03,681 --> 00:06:08,390
and susceptible to attack and history
across the world unfortunately shows that

118
00:06:08,391 --> 00:06:11,840
when the strong have an opportunity to
take from the week, they jump on it.

119
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:14,150
And that's precisely what the Vikings did.

120
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:18,500
One of those weaker neighbors was north
Umbria, a predecessor to English society,

121
00:06:18,501 --> 00:06:22,200
where in the year 793 the
Viking age began. And what?

122
00:06:22,201 --> 00:06:25,640
Talking about that in the next video to
keep up with this series and for more
