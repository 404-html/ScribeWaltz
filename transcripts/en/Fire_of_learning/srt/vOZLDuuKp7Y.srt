Hello and welcome to fire learning.

2
00:00:02,010 --> 00:00:06,390
Contrary to some belief whom is not just
a fancy way of saying who there is in

3
00:00:06,391 --> 00:00:07,820
fact a grammatical difference.

4
00:00:07,821 --> 00:00:10,110
And in this video we're going to
take a look at that difference.

5
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:14,130
The simple answer between the difference
of the two is that who is used as a

6
00:00:14,131 --> 00:00:18,210
subject and meaning it's used as
the doer of an action in a sentence.

7
00:00:18,211 --> 00:00:22,780
While whom is the receiver of that action,
the object of a verb or proposition.

8
00:00:22,990 --> 00:00:25,470
Let's look at some
sentences here for example,

9
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:30,650
who who is cleaning their car and this
sentence we're looking for the doer of

10
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:32,080
declining.

11
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:36,570
Therefore who who is washing fire of
learning and this sentence we are looking

12
00:00:36,571 --> 00:00:39,360
for again,
who is doing the watching,

13
00:00:39,630 --> 00:00:44,400
who is yelling at him and this sentence
we're looking for who is doing the

14
00:00:44,401 --> 00:00:44,731
yelling.

15
00:00:44,731 --> 00:00:49,731
However to flip it around the bed we
can employ whom to the same well similar

16
00:00:49,831 --> 00:00:52,620
sentence at whom is he yelling?

17
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:55,830
Because the person in question
is not the one doing the yelling,

18
00:00:55,831 --> 00:00:59,880
but the one being yelled at
the correct word here is whom?

19
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:02,910
For the more notice we said at whom,
not whom.

20
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:06,240
It's yelling ads because it's improper
to end a sentence with a preposition,

21
00:01:06,241 --> 00:01:10,470
but that's a topic for a future video.
For whom are we looking here,

22
00:01:10,471 --> 00:01:13,530
the focus is on the individual
for which the subject is looking,

23
00:01:13,531 --> 00:01:17,460
not the person doing the looking.
Whom do you believe? Here again,

24
00:01:17,461 --> 00:01:19,350
we're not asking who
is doing the believing,

25
00:01:19,351 --> 00:01:21,870
but we're asking about
the person being believed.

26
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:26,940
One helpful tip to remembering
this concept is simply
if who can be replaced by

27
00:01:26,941 --> 00:01:27,211
here,

28
00:01:27,211 --> 00:01:32,211
she then use who however I can if it
can be replaced by him or her use home.

29
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:35,940
Take a look at these sentences,
which one is correct.

30
00:01:38,930 --> 00:01:41,940
All right,
now try these.

31
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:50,220
If you answered B for both of them, then
you're getting the hang of it. If not,

32
00:01:50,221 --> 00:01:51,120
just keep working at it.

33
00:01:51,121 --> 00:01:54,720
It's perfectly understandable if it takes
a second to understand considering the

34
00:01:54,721 --> 00:01:57,720
fact that we actually make this
mistake a lot in common speech,

35
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:00,480
I make the mistake and common
conversation all the time.

36
00:02:00,481 --> 00:02:03,720
I've probably made a mistake
plenty of times and my past videos,

37
00:02:03,721 --> 00:02:07,470
but it's very important to understand
English and be able to use it well.

38
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:10,170
