00:00:01,170 --> 00:00:04,860
Hello and welcome to fire of learning.
Ask yourself the question,

2
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:09,000
what is life? If you ask what
the philosopher and a scientist,

3
00:00:09,001 --> 00:00:11,460
they would probably give you
two entirely different answers.

4
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:15,420
A scientist would be able to go into
detail about the biological intricacies of

5
00:00:15,421 --> 00:00:19,680
life on is talking about cells,
DNA, the taxonomic classifications,

6
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:24,060
survival, reproduction,
evolution, all that sort of
thing. A philosopher, however,

7
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:26,970
would focus more on something
like the human experience,

8
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:28,380
the meaning behind existing.

9
00:00:28,381 --> 00:00:32,040
The questions we ask ourselves about
existence and the guidelines we tend to

10
00:00:32,041 --> 00:00:35,730
employ to live our lives to the fullest
and in fact what a fulfilling life

11
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:38,970
really is.
Given both of these answers and topics,

12
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:43,830
which one is more important,
the scientific example or
the philosophical example?

13
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:47,700
Well, in fact, one could argue that
they are equally as important. However,

14
00:00:47,701 --> 00:00:50,550
this argument is not made
nearly enough as it should be.

15
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:54,240
Many popular scientists of
the day have to some degree,

16
00:00:54,241 --> 00:00:58,140
agreed upon the profound statement.
Philosophy is dead.

17
00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:01,290
They are good at science has replaced
a function of philosophy that the

18
00:01:01,291 --> 00:01:05,220
scientific method and empirical data
has replaced sitting in a room thinking

19
00:01:05,221 --> 00:01:09,780
about the universe entirely in order
to uncover its aspects and mysteries.

20
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:12,810
Something like the origin
of the universe for example,

21
00:01:12,811 --> 00:01:16,980
they claim has been taken from philosophy
and is now in the field of science.

22
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:19,620
In that regard, they are perhaps
somewhat right, you know,

23
00:01:19,621 --> 00:01:23,250
the universe or the physical forces
which shape the universe that we live in

24
00:01:23,251 --> 00:01:26,760
should be taken into science
as much as possible. However,

25
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:31,790
unfortunately the profound statement that
philosophy is dead is profoundly wrong

26
00:01:31,951 --> 00:01:36,330
and for as respectable and knowledgeable
as these scientists may be making these

27
00:01:36,331 --> 00:01:40,140
kinds of statements only demonstrates
that they aren't as aware of the role of

28
00:01:40,141 --> 00:01:44,610
philosophy in our society and our
individual lives as they should be. Sure.

29
00:01:44,611 --> 00:01:47,160
I mean they are right and
the argument that they make,

30
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:52,520
it's true that in the past many great
minds just assume they could sort of think

31
00:01:52,561 --> 00:01:55,080
of things and arrive to how
it works and what it is,

32
00:01:55,081 --> 00:01:58,500
which today has been
considerably replaced by science,

33
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:02,250
but that's a shallow example up the great
breadth of what philosophers did and

34
00:02:02,251 --> 00:02:04,800
still do.
If philosophy is dead,

35
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:09,690
then it's up to the scientist using only
science to answer some very important

36
00:02:09,691 --> 00:02:14,250
questions. For example, explain
scientifically, objectively,

37
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:18,360
why is it wrong to kill?
What is theft?

38
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,430
What should I be doing with my life?

39
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:24,690
Why shouldn't scientists be able to test
medications or even weapons and such

40
00:02:24,691 --> 00:02:29,670
things on humans? Furthermore, science
rest upon results, data the truth,

41
00:02:29,671 --> 00:02:33,090
but what does it mean for
something to be true? You see,

42
00:02:33,091 --> 00:02:37,290
these are questions which are
fundamental to our day to day lives,

43
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:41,190
but it's not something to which you could
just employ the scientific method to

44
00:02:41,191 --> 00:02:41,970
find out the answer.

45
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:45,000
So it's simply like you would
something within the field of physics.

46
00:02:45,001 --> 00:02:46,080
It's not that simple.

47
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:50,730
It's not so simple to try to
employ empiricism to abstractions,

48
00:02:50,731 --> 00:02:54,960
which is what these people who are
claiming philosophy to debt or doing what

49
00:02:54,961 --> 00:02:58,020
kind of government and economic
systems should we have at this?

50
00:02:58,021 --> 00:03:00,790
The scientist may jump to
respond. Oh, that's simple.

51
00:03:00,791 --> 00:03:03,460
We just take it every government
and economic system we have,

52
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:07,210
try it out in small test groups and
see which one works the best and try to

53
00:03:07,211 --> 00:03:11,650
implement those policies into our modern
society. True to logic and science.

54
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:15,910
But what do you mean by the best?
While the society,

55
00:03:15,911 --> 00:03:20,500
which is most efficient, but what does
it mean to be an efficient society?

56
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:23,890
Well, I suppose as a society in
which people are the happiest,

57
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:27,850
but why is happiness the most important
thing for which we should strive in life?

58
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:30,370
What is happiness?
What kind of happiness?

59
00:03:30,371 --> 00:03:34,630
The happiness of having a society which
produces free endless candy bars for all

60
00:03:34,631 --> 00:03:39,100
its inhabitants or a deeper happiness of
knowing one has lived a satisfying life.

61
00:03:39,490 --> 00:03:41,740
Who is happiness?
The happiness of the average person.

62
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:45,490
Does that mean that people above or below
the average who may find happiness and

63
00:03:45,491 --> 00:03:46,660
other things have to suffer?

64
00:03:47,050 --> 00:03:49,690
To what degree do the needs
of the many outweigh the few?

65
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:54,250
So by this I s I hope you see of course
how making such bland statements leads

66
00:03:54,251 --> 00:03:55,630
to a series of questions,

67
00:03:55,631 --> 00:03:59,590
which I hope reveals to you just how
deeply philosophy takes things. A depth,

68
00:03:59,591 --> 00:04:01,270
which I worry that many people,

69
00:04:01,271 --> 00:04:04,180
especially these people making these
statements that philosophy is dead,

70
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:05,230
aren't even aware of,

71
00:04:05,231 --> 00:04:09,040
let alone appreciate an offensive
scientists my grow angry at all these

72
00:04:09,041 --> 00:04:10,540
questions and ask,
well,

73
00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:14,350
when's the last time a philosopher ever
got us to the moon or cure a disease?

74
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:17,890
Good point. I'm not trying to degrade
the role of science here at all.

75
00:04:17,891 --> 00:04:21,940
Those achievements were largely made
directly by scientists, philosophers,

76
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:22,960
however,

77
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:27,220
indirectly questions and thoughts and
ideas and morals and ideologies were

78
00:04:27,221 --> 00:04:31,030
floating around. That even led to
things like that happening. We asked,

79
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:35,650
how can we get to the moon, but we also
asked, why should we go to the moon?

80
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:40,000
Why do we explore? What does it all mean?
Things that a philosopher would ask,

81
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:41,920
and it's important to keep in mind here.

82
00:04:41,921 --> 00:04:46,330
That motivation to go to the moon is
as important as technology to get their

83
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:49,960
face with something like colonizing the
moon and Mars philosopher has to ask the

84
00:04:49,961 --> 00:04:53,500
same questions, which may lead to
scientists to say, just shut up,

85
00:04:53,501 --> 00:04:54,700
dude is freaking cool.
Okay,

86
00:04:54,701 --> 00:04:58,360
that's why we're doing it for the
philosopher has a point look at how we've

87
00:04:58,361 --> 00:05:01,360
destroyed our own planet, for
example, as human society,

88
00:05:01,361 --> 00:05:02,470
a good thing which we should,

89
00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:06,160
which we should spread to other planets
and moons only to pollute and destroy

90
00:05:06,161 --> 00:05:08,650
them too.
And why should we cure diseases?

91
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:10,180
That's sound like a dumb question to ask,

92
00:05:10,181 --> 00:05:11,950
but it's still one which
has to be answered.

93
00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:15,010
Jonas Salk that didn't
have polio and furthermore,

94
00:05:15,011 --> 00:05:18,640
he didn't even patent his vaccine.
Why did he even bother?

95
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:22,300
What do we owe the world and why?
These other kinds of questions,

96
00:05:22,301 --> 00:05:25,060
again addressed by philosophy.

97
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:29,020
Scientists who are critical of philosophy
go at least five times as hard on

98
00:05:29,021 --> 00:05:32,350
religion, and I don't mean to take
a position for or against religion.

99
00:05:32,351 --> 00:05:33,760
That's not the purpose of this channel.

100
00:05:33,761 --> 00:05:36,820
Maybe some channels like to slip
their personal biases into that,

101
00:05:36,821 --> 00:05:37,660
but not this one.

102
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:42,160
But I will say that many of these big
scientists are factually atheists or

103
00:05:42,161 --> 00:05:47,161
agnostics or some variant of that and
without God or gods or some source for

104
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:49,410
objective morality, which is, you know,

105
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:52,000
instructions from a higher
power on how to live.

106
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,390
Basically philosophy
becomes even more important.

107
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:58,760
As soon as you decide you're an atheist,
an agnostic or something like that,

108
00:05:58,761 --> 00:06:01,600
which is by the way,
a position guided by whether you know,

109
00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:03,590
not whether you know it or not,
philosophy,

110
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:07,760
you're suddenly hit in the face with
some huge questions about what it is to

111
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:13,070
well, to even exist. Really an atheist
is all of a sudden faced with nihilism,

112
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:16,910
faced with the belief that nothing
matters. What does that mean?

113
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:21,560
Does that mean it's okay to do anything,
shoot people steal, burn down a house,

114
00:06:21,561 --> 00:06:25,310
et Cetera? Most atheists would
say, no, that's still wrong,

115
00:06:25,670 --> 00:06:29,390
but we're a Christian or Muslim or Hindu
or something like that would justify it

116
00:06:29,391 --> 00:06:32,600
being wrong based off their belief
that their dad say it is wrong.

117
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:37,310
The atheist has to go deeper and that
is done through it philosophy. So again,

118
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:40,940
when a scientist is analyzing bacteria
and the lab doing something which he or

119
00:06:40,941 --> 00:06:44,270
she may claim is purely biological,
purely scientific,

120
00:06:44,271 --> 00:06:47,540
they may feel comfortable saying
something like philosophy is dead,

121
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:52,190
but there isn't much time to
study bacteria in a society
which is convinced that

122
00:06:52,191 --> 00:06:55,970
we should live in a dictatorship in which
we worship ants and slave people with

123
00:06:55,971 --> 00:06:59,540
green eyes and avoid technology because
of the harm it brings because we have

124
00:06:59,541 --> 00:07:02,840
abandoned philosophy. That is another
very important argument to consider.

125
00:07:02,841 --> 00:07:03,291
By the way,

126
00:07:03,291 --> 00:07:07,490
what if science and technology leads to
what's being unhappy should be continued

127
00:07:07,491 --> 00:07:12,230
to pursue it in this society?
You'd probably be pretty unhappy.

128
00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:17,060
Your lab was destroyed by soldiers. Your
job as a microbiologist is now illegal.

129
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:20,900
You live under a dictator now and if
you have green eyes, you're a slave.

130
00:07:21,170 --> 00:07:25,520
You might protest. This is against their
rights, but the dictator would laugh.

131
00:07:25,730 --> 00:07:28,730
What rights? The right to free
speech, the right to live freely,

132
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:31,640
essentially human rights.
He makes you a deal.

133
00:07:31,641 --> 00:07:35,150
If you can prove that these
rights exist unless you go,

134
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:39,290
unfortunately for you,
you may be spending some time in slavery,

135
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:42,560
used to be value our rights and
exercise them on a daily basis.

136
00:07:42,561 --> 00:07:44,900
Even if we don't think about them.
For many of us,

137
00:07:44,901 --> 00:07:46,430
they are intrinsic to who we are,

138
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:50,870
but they can't scientifically be proven
to exist and therefore they can be

139
00:07:50,871 --> 00:07:51,980
easily stripped from you.

140
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:55,730
Rights exists because a handful
of intelligent people I eat,

141
00:07:55,731 --> 00:07:57,590
philosophers decided that they should,

142
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:02,090
and the common person then agreed to
mutually respect and uphold them beyond

143
00:08:02,091 --> 00:08:02,271
that.

144
00:08:02,271 --> 00:08:06,140
Places for people who abuse these rights
called prisons were created in order to

145
00:08:06,141 --> 00:08:09,740
uphold them. So again, we come
to these big important questions.

146
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:14,060
What is life all about? How should I
live mine? How should we build society?

147
00:08:14,061 --> 00:08:17,780
What role do I have insights society
and why, et Cetera, et cetera.

148
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:20,480
Philosophers give a wide range of answers,

149
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:23,930
some argue that we should
dedicate ourselves to
upholding the greatest society

150
00:08:23,931 --> 00:08:27,710
at all costs. Sort of that the whole
is more than the sum of its parts.

151
00:08:27,850 --> 00:08:31,630
Some are less collectivist, but still
argue that by being born into society,

152
00:08:31,650 --> 00:08:35,420
be signed. His social contract in which
we agreed to follow laws and participate

153
00:08:35,421 --> 00:08:38,270
respectfully,
that we have a duty to society.

154
00:08:38,330 --> 00:08:42,110
Some say that's nonsense and the rules
of society change with who is in it and

155
00:08:42,111 --> 00:08:45,200
that we shouldn't force people to
participate in it in voluntarily.

156
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:47,030
Some say we should vote on decisions.

157
00:08:47,031 --> 00:08:49,610
Other people say the average
person is too dumb to vote.

158
00:08:49,611 --> 00:08:52,370
We need strong authority figures
and make decisions for us.

159
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:57,060
Some say taxes are justified in that day
can be utilized to improve our society.

160
00:08:57,090 --> 00:08:58,730
Others say Tech Station has stepped.

161
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:02,310
Some say owning something like land
but they don't use is justifiable.

162
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:03,810
Others say the property's theft.

163
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:08,070
Some say we should focus on maximizing
our own existence over coming barriers to

164
00:09:08,071 --> 00:09:09,750
live the best life we possibly can.

165
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:13,280
Some would say that society comes second
to the individual and that we should

166
00:09:13,281 --> 00:09:17,430
delve as society as a union
of self interested people
who aren't subservience to

167
00:09:17,431 --> 00:09:19,140
ideologies or abstractions.

168
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:23,010
Some say happiness is the ultimate golf
for which people should strive to get of

169
00:09:23,011 --> 00:09:26,970
life and of these there are thousand
interpretations of what happiness is and

170
00:09:26,971 --> 00:09:29,610
how we should go about
achieving it. Some, however,

171
00:09:29,611 --> 00:09:31,680
would argue against
something like hedonism.

172
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:34,290
You could go on for days
exploring these questions.

173
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:37,860
Well actually humans have gone on for
thousands of years asking these questions

174
00:09:37,861 --> 00:09:41,220
and we still don't have definite answers
that everybody seems to agree on.

175
00:09:41,310 --> 00:09:45,960
Some I concluding point here to anyone
who has followed what's called scientism.

176
00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:49,560
The belief that philosophy is dead and
the science can take over and answer all

177
00:09:49,561 --> 00:09:54,561
questions is that the very existence of
science rest upon foundations made by

178
00:09:54,901 --> 00:09:59,700
philosophy. Empiricism rests
on philosophical argumentation
for us effectiveness.

179
00:09:59,701 --> 00:10:02,880
The argument that we should employ
science to improve our lives is a

180
00:10:02,881 --> 00:10:06,390
philosophical debate.
The very societies that we have created,

181
00:10:06,391 --> 00:10:10,410
which allows science to even exist in
all its modern glory are dependent upon

182
00:10:10,411 --> 00:10:13,860
philosophical arguments for
the existence of such things.

183
00:10:14,130 --> 00:10:17,850
So no philosophy is not dead.
It's alive and arguably better than ever.

184
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:20,880
Science is not a separate
process from philosophy.

185
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,650
They are very closely intertwined.

186
00:10:22,651 --> 00:10:25,620
To the point where I would say that
anyone who calls himself a scientist,

187
00:10:25,621 --> 00:10:28,950
anyone who claims to wake up in the
morning with a desire to understand the

188
00:10:28,951 --> 00:10:31,920
world, needs to give some
consideration to philosophy.

189
00:10:32,190 --> 00:10:33,330
Even if you're not a scientist,

190
00:10:33,331 --> 00:10:37,230
anyone who seeks to live a fulfilling
life should give some time and thought to

191
00:10:37,231 --> 00:10:40,110
philosophy because as Socrates tells us,

192
00:10:40,111 --> 00:10:42,390
the unexamined life is not worth living.

193
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:45,000
For more videos like this and
videos on many other subjects,

194
00:10:45,010 --> 00:10:47,220
we should have checked off
fire of learning and subscribe.

195
00:10:47,310 --> 00:10:48,240
Thank you for watching.
