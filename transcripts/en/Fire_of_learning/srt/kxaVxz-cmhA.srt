1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:03,570
The United States of America
is a relatively new nation,

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:07,650
haven't been founded only a few hundred
years ago. However, despite its youth,

3
00:00:07,651 --> 00:00:12,030
it has quickly risen to become a world
power and has had and currently has a

4
00:00:12,031 --> 00:00:16,830
major impact on economics, politics,
technology and science, the arts,

5
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:20,610
culture, and other aspects of
society across the entire globe.

6
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:25,050
What began as English settlements on
the coast of a world unknown to the

7
00:00:25,051 --> 00:00:29,250
settlers would come to conquer that world
and rise to claim the title of world's

8
00:00:29,290 --> 00:00:31,110
superpower.
In the meantime,

9
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:35,340
the nation would change considerably
as it expanded and forge an identity,

10
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:38,670
and in this video we're going to
discuss that identity and the history.

11
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:39,720
So let's get to it.

12
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:44,910
The land we call the United States today
had been inhabited by various native

13
00:00:44,911 --> 00:00:47,220
American peoples as long
before its existence.

14
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:51,240
These people were to send it from a
group of Eurasians across the Bering Land

15
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:53,040
Bridge about 16,000 years ago.

16
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:56,340
Many of them develop some
considerably complex societies,

17
00:00:56,341 --> 00:00:59,670
which would cross paths with the Europeans
and their expansion into the region.

18
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:03,660
However, the United States is
politically, economically, socially,

19
00:01:03,661 --> 00:01:07,950
and culturally much more to send it from
European, the native American elements,

20
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:12,390
Americans and native Americans consider
their histories separate up until the

21
00:01:12,391 --> 00:01:16,050
intertwining of the two and the histories
of the various indigenous peoples

22
00:01:16,051 --> 00:01:19,800
before the USA will be covered in depth.
In future videos,

23
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:24,420
Americans typically begin their country's
story with the voyages of Christopher

24
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:27,780
Columbus. We now know that at least
one other old world civilization,

25
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:31,170
the Vikings reached America before
Columbus and possibly others,

26
00:01:31,171 --> 00:01:34,620
possibly even other Europeans,
but even though Columbus was not first,

27
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:38,160
it was his journey that
began the processes that will
lead to the linking of the

28
00:01:38,161 --> 00:01:42,350
old and new worlds and thereby the
United States. So he remains irrelevant.

29
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:44,700
Figure Columbus sailed to the new world,

30
00:01:44,701 --> 00:01:48,240
essentially to find a new trade route
to India as the traditional route to the

31
00:01:48,241 --> 00:01:51,030
east have been cut off by the
hostile and Muslim Ottoman Turks.

32
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:52,650
When they captured Constantinople,

33
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:56,400
he landed in the modern day Caribbean
and claim the land for Spain.

34
00:01:56,430 --> 00:02:00,210
Those Spain and Portugal will later to
spit the land claims and settle it with a

35
00:02:00,211 --> 00:02:00,910
treaty of tourists.

36
00:02:00,910 --> 00:02:05,760
Hideous Columbus would never realize
that the land in which she had landed was

37
00:02:05,761 --> 00:02:09,450
not Asia and the fact that he was unaware
that he had landed in an entirely new

38
00:02:09,451 --> 00:02:13,890
continent is why the native Americans
are a times still referred to as Indians.

39
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:18,990
It was only realized shortly after his
death by America vis fugi after whom the

40
00:02:18,991 --> 00:02:23,910
continent is actually named his Latin
name being America's Columbus will be made

41
00:02:23,911 --> 00:02:24,960
governor of the area,

42
00:02:24,961 --> 00:02:28,440
but as brutal rule over the native peoples
would have hoard the Spanish monarchs

43
00:02:28,441 --> 00:02:30,240
and caused him to remove him from power.

44
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:33,990
Columbus died in 1504 but
its effect on history,

45
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:37,410
the linking of the two worlds for better
and for worse with long outlive him.

46
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:41,460
The Europeans were now very
greatly interested in the
land resources and all the

47
00:02:41,461 --> 00:02:45,540
opportunities that this new world
had to offer. Spain and Portugal,

48
00:02:45,541 --> 00:02:49,170
what continue to lead the charge into the
Americas for at least the next century

49
00:02:49,171 --> 00:02:52,740
and extend the grip across much of
north central and South America.

50
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:54,810
Immediately after Spain's discovery,

51
00:02:54,811 --> 00:02:58,170
the other late 15th century major
powers of Europe, Portugal, France,

52
00:02:58,171 --> 00:03:01,630
and England realized they needed to
jump into the theater right away,

53
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:05,890
a wave of explorers be sent to
the new world and coming decades.

54
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:08,260
The King of England,
Henry that's seventh,

55
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:12,370
was introduced the concept of finding a
northern route to China by an Italian by

56
00:03:12,371 --> 00:03:16,420
the name of Giovanni Kuboto. Just a
few years after Columbus is landing,

57
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:20,560
Giovanni now living in England
would change his name to John Cabot.

58
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:25,710
Henry would then decide to sponsor
his voyage and in 1497 cabinets depart

59
00:03:25,841 --> 00:03:29,800
westward. Eventually he would land
and what he assumed was likely China,

60
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:33,070
but was in fact probably either
Newfoundland or Nova Scotia.

61
00:03:33,490 --> 00:03:36,940
Kevin did not stay long on his voyage
and though he found evidence of human

62
00:03:36,941 --> 00:03:40,540
activity in the area did not make
contact with any of the native Americans.

63
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:44,530
After his voyages. Records of
Cabot's existence become less clear,

64
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:47,590
though it's likely that he died
shortly after and unfitting end.

65
00:03:47,591 --> 00:03:51,100
For someone who had now set the stage
for English involvement in North America

66
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:53,200
over the next century.

67
00:03:53,201 --> 00:03:56,680
Multiple nations would attempt colonies
in the modern day United States,

68
00:03:56,710 --> 00:03:57,940
most of which would fail.

69
00:03:58,150 --> 00:04:02,220
The Americas were land of
great opportunity to the
Europeans for the cost of

70
00:04:02,221 --> 00:04:06,130
that opportunity was contending with
disease, starvation, harsh weather,

71
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:10,480
isolation from the Homeworld and hostile
native Americans who had inhabited

72
00:04:10,481 --> 00:04:14,950
lands from Millennia as France began its
colonization and exploration of America,

73
00:04:14,951 --> 00:04:18,760
which would later lead to the places
not on as Quebec Acadia and Louisiana.

74
00:04:19,210 --> 00:04:22,030
England would make its first
effort at a colony and modern day.

75
00:04:22,031 --> 00:04:27,031
North Carolina on an island
known as Roanoke island
named after the local native

76
00:04:27,101 --> 00:04:30,310
peoples.
On March 25th,

77
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:33,730
1584 Queen Elizabeth the first gave Sir
Walter really the right to organize a

78
00:04:33,731 --> 00:04:35,020
colony in North America,

79
00:04:35,021 --> 00:04:37,780
which would serve to establish
England's presence on the continent,

80
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:41,560
generate commerce, and to construct a
military base against their main enemies.

81
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:44,530
The Spanish one would be
established on Roanoke.

82
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:48,220
The colonist here will be the first
Englishman to cultivate and bring back to

83
00:04:48,221 --> 00:04:50,860
England. Things like corn,
potatoes, and tobacco.

84
00:04:51,010 --> 00:04:55,060
The first English child born in America,
Virginia dare was born in this. Connie,

85
00:04:55,061 --> 00:04:58,840
on August 18th the granddaughter
and the colonies leader, John White,

86
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:04,330
118 people lived in this colony.
John White Left, returned to England,

87
00:05:04,331 --> 00:05:07,510
but when he came back to the colony after
having been delayed for a few years,

88
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:12,100
there was no trace of them. The colonists
and most of the colony had vanished.

89
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:16,060
White found no evidence of a struggle
or a battle and much the settlement had

90
00:05:16,061 --> 00:05:19,510
been dismantled and what looks
like a calmly and organized manner.

91
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:23,860
All that why could find was the
word Krakatoan carved on a tree.

92
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:27,910
White was unable to search nearby islands
because of weather. And to this day,

93
00:05:27,911 --> 00:05:29,770
no one knows exactly what happened.

94
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:33,520
The first English colonization of
the new world was not only a failure,

95
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:34,630
it was a mystery.

96
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:38,050
The English had failed and their
first attempt and other attempts,

97
00:05:38,051 --> 00:05:39,880
but would naturally try again.

98
00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:43,210
17 years later on May 14th,

99
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:45,650
1607 the colony of Jamestown
was founded in Atlanta,

100
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:50,140
come to call Virginia after the
Virgin Queen Elizabeth, the settlers,

101
00:05:50,141 --> 00:05:52,360
a mix of laborers and
gentlemen from England.

102
00:05:52,570 --> 00:05:56,590
Expect the primary function of this call
need to be the extraction of gold and

103
00:05:56,591 --> 00:05:58,130
silver.
However,

104
00:05:58,131 --> 00:06:02,060
as was often a case for Europeans
coming to the new world with this death,

105
00:06:02,061 --> 00:06:05,750
his time with his intention, they quickly
discovered that there was little here.

106
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:07,160
Within weeks of landing,

107
00:06:07,161 --> 00:06:11,030
the men started being attacked by the
native pow hot and tribe the English.

108
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:12,950
However,
we're prepared to respond to this threat.

109
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:16,940
They came well armed and
constructive professional
fortifications within 20 days.

110
00:06:17,450 --> 00:06:19,960
Perhaps they had secured
themselves militarily,

111
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,180
but the settlers soon began to realize
that they would not be without other

112
00:06:23,181 --> 00:06:24,014
hardships.

113
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:27,860
The settlers unfortunately arrived at
Jamestown during one of the greatest

114
00:06:27,861 --> 00:06:30,710
droughts within a thousand year record.
Furthermore,

115
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:34,040
not only had they arrive too late in
the season to effectively grow food,

116
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:37,340
but many of the columnists were
not skilled farmers are foreigners.

117
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:41,120
Many were expecting of trade for food
with the local natives for the drought was

118
00:06:41,121 --> 00:06:42,350
affecting them as well.

119
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:46,070
The settler is found themselves too busy
trying to survive the harvest nearby

120
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,960
resources or look for golden silver.

121
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:52,520
On top of this disease was rampant and
perhaps we kill more in Jamestown and

122
00:06:52,521 --> 00:06:55,190
starvation or the continuous
native American attacks.

123
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:58,760
The majority of colonists who lived
here with die of these hardships.

124
00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:00,740
Within the first five or so years,

125
00:07:00,741 --> 00:07:04,610
that population would go
from 500 to 60 John Smith,

126
00:07:04,611 --> 00:07:07,610
the colonies leader was the man
holding this call need together.

127
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:12,200
It was he who insisted a new shipment
of supplies we sent from England and he

128
00:07:12,201 --> 00:07:15,830
then install the very simple and straight
forward rule for the colonists quoting

129
00:07:15,831 --> 00:07:18,860
the Bible. He said he who
will not work, will not eat,

130
00:07:19,130 --> 00:07:23,600
directed mostly towards to settlements
upperclass and it was John Smith

131
00:07:23,601 --> 00:07:27,620
primarily who held the most successful
negotiations with the native Americans.

132
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:31,460
He also named the region of New England,
a name which lasts to this day.

133
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:35,240
John Smith's contribution
to Jamestown was invaluable,

134
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,730
but he was returned to England after
being injured in an accidental gunpowder

135
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:43,780
explosion in 1609 the colonists entered
into what is known as the starving time

136
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:46,880
and are forced to eat
rats, horses, dogs, snakes,

137
00:07:46,881 --> 00:07:48,530
and eventually whatever they could find.

138
00:07:48,770 --> 00:07:51,200
In some instances they
would turn to cannibalism.

139
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:55,700
The natives kept attacking disease was
unchecked and paranoia was rampant.

140
00:07:55,940 --> 00:07:59,930
Suspicions of Catholic or Spanish
plots ran high and indeed there is no

141
00:07:59,931 --> 00:08:02,960
scientific evidence of arsenic
poisoning taking place here.

142
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:07,540
The colony was nearly abandoned until
the arrival of Thomas West third bear and

143
00:08:07,541 --> 00:08:10,250
dilawar better known as Lord Delaware.

144
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:14,270
Delaware was the most effective leaders
since John Smith and helped her in the

145
00:08:14,271 --> 00:08:17,570
colony around. Furthermore,
along with Lord Delaware,

146
00:08:17,571 --> 00:08:21,080
a man by the name of John Ralf carried
with him something which would also help

147
00:08:21,081 --> 00:08:24,800
shape the future fortunes of Jamestown,
a new strain of tobacco.

148
00:08:24,801 --> 00:08:26,090
He intended to start growing.

149
00:08:26,450 --> 00:08:29,630
The tobacco was very popular in England
and it would not only make Ralf a

150
00:08:29,631 --> 00:08:30,464
wealthy man,

151
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:34,790
but save Jamestown Roth having become
an important figure in the Connie.

152
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:37,100
What Mary? The chief's
daughter, Pocahontas,

153
00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:39,680
which would secure piece between
the [inaudible] and the English.

154
00:08:39,681 --> 00:08:42,710
For a few years long enough
to get James Town on his feet.

155
00:08:43,430 --> 00:08:46,070
The colony would now begin
to grow into the thousands,

156
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:49,520
many who came over for the next few
decades where what are known as indentured

157
00:08:49,521 --> 00:08:50,354
servants.

158
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:54,680
These laborers sign contracts promising
to work in the area in exchange for

159
00:08:54,681 --> 00:08:56,070
residents and voyage there.

160
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:59,520
After a specific amount of time
when they had paid off their debts,

161
00:08:59,521 --> 00:09:01,020
they were free to go off on their own.

162
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:06,350
James also eventually saw the first
African slaves and American 16 1920 slaves

163
00:09:06,991 --> 00:09:09,550
intended for the Spanish colonies
were brought to Jamestown,

164
00:09:09,710 --> 00:09:12,420
though some were eventually
granted a degree of freedom.

165
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:16,260
Many other important historical events
would take place at Jamestown as well.

166
00:09:16,770 --> 00:09:20,850
The first body of elected representatives
known as the house of burgesses would

167
00:09:20,851 --> 00:09:21,630
assemble.

168
00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:25,560
It was intended to represent the voices
of the inhabitants of Jamestown to make

169
00:09:25,561 --> 00:09:28,350
it more agreeable. Though only
English men were allowed to vote.

170
00:09:28,830 --> 00:09:32,640
The Polish Slovakian and German sellers,
we're not outraged.

171
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:36,210
They formed the first protest and refuse
to work until they were granted a right

172
00:09:36,211 --> 00:09:39,090
to vote as well. Within
a month, it had worked.

173
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:42,960
Conflict with the native Americans would
eventually resume and would last for

174
00:09:42,961 --> 00:09:45,300
decades within time.
However,

175
00:09:45,330 --> 00:09:48,960
the English would weaken and eventually
destroy the power. Hot and confederacy.

176
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:52,980
Meanwhile to the north England was
expanding its presence in the new world.

177
00:09:52,981 --> 00:09:57,900
Further and 1620 a group of pure attend
religious separatists from the Anglican

178
00:09:57,901 --> 00:10:02,901
church known as the pilgrims would travel
to America originally relocating to

179
00:10:02,971 --> 00:10:05,370
the Netherlands after having
been unwelcome and England,

180
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:08,670
feeling that the Anglican church
resembled a Catholic church far too much,

181
00:10:08,770 --> 00:10:11,640
they decided instead to found
a settlement in a new world.

182
00:10:12,090 --> 00:10:16,350
The settlements they let her felt could
grow to become a city on a hill serving

183
00:10:16,351 --> 00:10:18,930
as an example of morality
and piety to Europe,

184
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:24,060
the pilgrims led by William Bradford
boarded a ship known as the May flower

185
00:10:24,061 --> 00:10:27,870
along with a number of other English
merchants and craftsmen and set sail for

186
00:10:27,871 --> 00:10:30,660
the new world. Eventually finding
a settlement and a Cape Cod area.

187
00:10:30,661 --> 00:10:33,540
In Modern Day Massachusetts.
Before landing,

188
00:10:33,541 --> 00:10:37,020
the colonist drew up what they
would call the Mayflower compact.

189
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:40,620
This established a set of laws which
the colony would follow and sell

190
00:10:40,621 --> 00:10:45,120
disagreements between the Puritan and
non puritan settlers and the first winter

191
00:10:45,121 --> 00:10:49,080
about half of the original settlers of
a dye. Toward the end of the winter,

192
00:10:49,081 --> 00:10:51,690
formal relations with the
local native Americans began.

193
00:10:52,050 --> 00:10:55,530
There was some disagreement among
the two sides at first. However,

194
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:58,910
the relationship between the English and
the native Americans here with turnout

195
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:00,690
to go very well.
At first,

196
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:03,600
the Wampanoag people would
even help the English survive,

197
00:11:03,601 --> 00:11:06,690
teaching them new farming techniques
and familiarizing them with the land.

198
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:09,600
After a year of hard
work in general success,

199
00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:13,080
the natives and pilgrims celebrated
the autumnal harvest together,

200
00:11:13,290 --> 00:11:17,040
while not necessarily
celebrating the success of
everything going on. In general,

201
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:22,310
this feast would later become
the Thanksgiving holiday
and the 1630 is more of

202
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:26,880
the foundations for what would become
England's 13 colonies began to take root.

203
00:11:27,090 --> 00:11:29,460
This growth would not be unimpeded.
However,

204
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:32,850
along with the native Americans who
were beginning to react to increased

205
00:11:32,851 --> 00:11:36,450
pressure on them in a lens.
England was also competing in the theater.

206
00:11:36,451 --> 00:11:37,620
It was Spain,
the Dutch,

207
00:11:37,650 --> 00:11:42,650
Sweden for a little while and France and
July of 1636 the first major war in the

208
00:11:43,141 --> 00:11:45,090
region with breakout,
the p Quad war.

209
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:49,170
It arose as a mixture of English expansion
into the region and the attempts of

210
00:11:49,171 --> 00:11:51,540
the p tribe to dominate
trade in the region.

211
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:54,040
The war would primarily consists of the

212
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:57,550
two sides conducting raids against each
other and having skirmishes with the

213
00:11:57,551 --> 00:12:01,120
wars, climax being what is
referred to as the mystic massacre,

214
00:12:01,210 --> 00:12:05,110
wherein the English and their
native allies assaulted a
p Quad village burned it

215
00:12:05,111 --> 00:12:07,210
and killed it,
likely over 500 people.

216
00:12:07,450 --> 00:12:11,980
By the 1640s tens of thousands of English
settlers were living in the colonies

217
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:16,030
and the 16 fifty's a series of conflicts
would be game with a Dutch sparked by

218
00:12:16,031 --> 00:12:18,820
conflict in Europe.
During the Anglo Dutch wars,

219
00:12:18,821 --> 00:12:21,220
the English would conquer Dutch
territory in North America,

220
00:12:21,221 --> 00:12:23,410
including most notably
the city of new Amsterdam,

221
00:12:23,411 --> 00:12:25,540
which the English would
rename to New York.

222
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:30,910
In 1670 Charles 10 was founded paving
the way for the Carolina colonies.

223
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:33,700
Carolina being Latin for Charles,
named after Charles.

224
00:12:33,701 --> 00:12:35,680
The second though the colonies were,

225
00:12:35,681 --> 00:12:39,550
as I said in an in this time numbering
and the tens of thousands of people,

226
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:41,830
there was still a great demand for labor,

227
00:12:41,831 --> 00:12:45,070
increasing the number of indentured
servants and African slaves into the

228
00:12:45,071 --> 00:12:45,904
colonies.

229
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:50,680
In 1675 a major conflicts between the
English and the native American tribes

230
00:12:50,681 --> 00:12:51,491
known as King.

231
00:12:51,491 --> 00:12:54,970
Phillip's war would break out from
the strains of English expansion.

232
00:12:55,630 --> 00:12:57,730
King Phillip refers
somewhat humorous leads.

233
00:12:57,740 --> 00:13:00,070
The leader of the Wampanoag
tribe made a comment.

234
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:04,420
Thousands died in this war and significant
parts of New England where pillaged

235
00:13:04,421 --> 00:13:06,970
and burned by the natives,
but the English would of course,

236
00:13:06,971 --> 00:13:11,971
eventually when this war in 1678 with
the death of medic comment following this

237
00:13:12,191 --> 00:13:15,610
war, England has secured his
position on the coastal regions.

238
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:20,170
Also in 1678 another major incident
occurred in colonial history,

239
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:23,440
Bacon's rebellion.
As land became scarcer,

240
00:13:23,441 --> 00:13:27,130
the English and Virginia felt need
to push westward into native American

241
00:13:27,131 --> 00:13:29,950
territory. Virginia Governor
William Berkeley. However,

242
00:13:29,951 --> 00:13:33,580
it was trying to avoid conflict with the
native Americans for multiple reasons.

243
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,450
War was very strenuous and
trade was often very profitable.

244
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:39,040
With Len becoming scarcer,

245
00:13:39,041 --> 00:13:42,940
indentured servants receive less than
ideal land surrounded by hostile natives

246
00:13:42,941 --> 00:13:45,270
and felt powerless to
respond and response.

247
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:49,150
A group of both white and black men led
by Nathaniel Bacon began writing native

248
00:13:49,151 --> 00:13:52,900
American villages, which occupied
land that they wanted to expand into.

249
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:56,800
On September 16th much of Jamestown
will be burned by the rebels,

250
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:59,530
had Nathaniel bacon not died of dysentery.
A month later,

251
00:13:59,531 --> 00:14:01,120
the rebellion may have continued further.

252
00:14:01,390 --> 00:14:05,080
Bacon's rebellion failed and the colonial
government was forced to respond and

253
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:09,010
indentured servitude having become more
costly and unstable to the wealthy elite,

254
00:14:09,011 --> 00:14:12,400
the funded it was gradually stopped.
As a result,

255
00:14:12,430 --> 00:14:16,060
the labor shortage and the sprawling
agricultural society that the south would

256
00:14:16,061 --> 00:14:20,420
lead to a grid of the man for African
slaves and 1680 the French claim to

257
00:14:20,421 --> 00:14:22,300
territory surrounding the Mississippi.

258
00:14:22,450 --> 00:14:24,880
They called a great stretch
of land at Louisiana.

259
00:14:24,910 --> 00:14:28,570
After Louie the 14th as England's
colonies continued to expand,

260
00:14:28,571 --> 00:14:29,830
Francis did as well.

261
00:14:29,950 --> 00:14:34,360
The European borders of the new world
began to touch both England and France and

262
00:14:34,361 --> 00:14:38,200
claim land to Canada and had specific
interest it controlling the waterways of

263
00:14:38,201 --> 00:14:41,110
North America such as the
Great Lakes and the Ohio River.

264
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:45,510
On March 4th, 1681 William Penn
was granted or well charted.

265
00:14:45,511 --> 00:14:49,330
It found land known as Pennsylvania,
Latin for pens, forest.

266
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:52,760
This territory would increase Anglo
French tensions in the region.

267
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:55,910
This tension would lead to conflict
between the two nations. In fact,

268
00:14:55,911 --> 00:15:00,710
four major wars often involving native
Americans in coinciding with conflict in

269
00:15:00,711 --> 00:15:04,700
Europe and 1688 King William's war,
the first war was fought,

270
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:08,000
though the borders would remain
essentially similar. Five years later,

271
00:15:08,001 --> 00:15:11,000
Queen Anne's war would break out
between England or as it was now,

272
00:15:11,001 --> 00:15:12,800
Britain against France and Spain.

273
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:18,410
The war would last for 11 years in
cell 1713 with Breton as a clear victor

274
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:22,670
getting more territory and 1740
king George's war broke out.

275
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:25,250
This war saw slight
French military victory.

276
00:15:25,251 --> 00:15:28,400
Though little territorial changes
were really made. The colonies,

277
00:15:28,401 --> 00:15:31,280
particularly New England, however,
would suffer great losses.

278
00:15:31,490 --> 00:15:35,000
The lack of resolution is toward any of
the major problems here with lead to the

279
00:15:35,001 --> 00:15:38,720
final fourth major showed between the
colonies of Britain and France in North

280
00:15:38,721 --> 00:15:43,721
America in 1754 referred to in the United
States as the French and Indian war.

281
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:48,230
The war would settle the dispute
between Britain and France and lay the

282
00:15:48,231 --> 00:15:51,950
foundations for the future of the
continent, Britain and France,

283
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:54,920
where arguably evenly matched,
but for different reasons.

284
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:58,550
The population of the British
colonies had grown to about 2 million,

285
00:15:58,610 --> 00:16:03,230
but from Louisiana to Canada, there
were only about 60,000 French Canadians.

286
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:07,310
The French, however, still had a very
strong emphasis on military in the region.

287
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:08,060
Furthermore,

288
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:11,720
the French had done better at maintaining
peaceful relations with the native

289
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:13,190
Americans and the British and accordingly,

290
00:16:13,490 --> 00:16:16,160
most native tribes involved
with Psi with the French,

291
00:16:16,190 --> 00:16:18,650
with the exception of
tribes such as the Iroquois.

292
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:23,180
The war would break out over territorial
disputes around basically the Great

293
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:27,020
Lakes and the Ohio River with particular
emphasis on the Ohio country here.

294
00:16:27,290 --> 00:16:31,400
When a 21 year old British officer from
Virginia named at George Washington

295
00:16:31,401 --> 00:16:34,930
engage a company of French forces in a
small skirmish called the battle of his

296
00:16:34,931 --> 00:16:38,240
Human Ville, Glenn War
broke out. During this war,

297
00:16:38,270 --> 00:16:40,670
the colonies would meet
as one for the first time.

298
00:16:40,671 --> 00:16:45,110
It's something known as the
Albany Congress wherein a
48 year old polymath named

299
00:16:45,111 --> 00:16:48,590
Benjamin Franklin would suggest
a common defense of the colonies.

300
00:16:48,770 --> 00:16:50,450
For the first four years of the war.

301
00:16:50,451 --> 00:16:54,710
The French were consistently winning
against the British and 1758 however,

302
00:16:54,711 --> 00:16:57,650
the tide of war changed
when General John Forbes,

303
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:01,760
the Forbes expedition with the intended
goal of winning three specific victories

304
00:17:01,850 --> 00:17:04,760
established by the British
Secretary of State, William Pitt,

305
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:06,350
after whom the city of Pittsburgh,

306
00:17:06,351 --> 00:17:10,550
his name's he would succeed at to drive
in the French from Fort Duquesne in the

307
00:17:10,551 --> 00:17:13,160
Ohio Valley and Louie
Berg and Nova Scotia.

308
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:16,020
The third invasion would
fail with a backup car,

309
00:17:16,030 --> 00:17:21,030
y'all in which around 3000 French troops
defeated 18,000 British throughout the

310
00:17:21,261 --> 00:17:22,310
rest of the war.
However,

311
00:17:22,311 --> 00:17:27,020
the British would begin to consistently
win over the French in 1760 when general

312
00:17:27,021 --> 00:17:30,500
James Wolff would die during
his victorious assault
salt on the French at the

313
00:17:30,501 --> 00:17:33,890
battle of the plains of Abraham,
the British would occupy Quebec City,

314
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:36,950
which essentially allowed them
to capitulate the rest of Canada.

315
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:42,440
Though the war would continue for three
more years into 1763 the main portion of

316
00:17:42,441 --> 00:17:44,690
it had ended with the battle
of the plains of Abraham.

317
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:49,290
The war ended with the treaty of Paris
officially that year and in that the

318
00:17:49,291 --> 00:17:53,020
French chose to retain their
more profitable Caribbean
colonies over disputing

319
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:54,360
their holdings in North America.

320
00:17:54,690 --> 00:17:59,220
Britain would claim the rest of Canada
and the Ohio region and Francis Louisiana

321
00:17:59,221 --> 00:18:02,640
territory would be given to Spain as
compensation for the loss of Florida.

322
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:06,570
Britain was now essentially the
unchallenged power in North America.

323
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:08,730
Though this position came at a cost,

324
00:18:09,270 --> 00:18:12,840
the British had nearly doubled their
national debt and had to increase taxes

325
00:18:12,841 --> 00:18:15,720
across the empire,
including the North American colonies,

326
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:20,580
which would literally the complications
in relations with the colonies following

327
00:18:20,581 --> 00:18:24,360
the French and Indian war, Pontiac's
rebellion would take place. A reaction.

328
00:18:24,361 --> 00:18:27,240
Depression now felt by the
natives from British expansion.

329
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:31,050
Thousands of British soldiers and colonist
would be killed or displaced by the

330
00:18:31,051 --> 00:18:32,730
natives would eventually be defeated.

331
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:36,420
The policy regarding their subjugation
was lightened following the rebellion.

332
00:18:36,630 --> 00:18:37,680
Soon thereafter,

333
00:18:37,681 --> 00:18:42,681
the royal proclamation of 1763 four
bay colonists from settling west of the

334
00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:43,980
Appalachian Mountains.

335
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:47,460
The fact that colonists were not only
forbidden from settling west of the

336
00:18:47,461 --> 00:18:48,121
Appalachians,

337
00:18:48,121 --> 00:18:52,080
but were in fact sometimes removed by
the British military forcibly would

338
00:18:52,081 --> 00:18:53,580
agitate the colonists.
Further,

339
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:58,380
the royal proclamation of 1763 would
be among the first of several incidents

340
00:18:58,381 --> 00:19:02,040
over the coming decade that would lead
to strain between the British and the 13

341
00:19:02,041 --> 00:19:03,450
colonies colonies,

342
00:19:03,451 --> 00:19:07,560
which Heather had enjoyed a high
degree of independence tensions,

343
00:19:07,561 --> 00:19:11,700
but grow throughout the 1760s
as the British did things
such as imposed a number

344
00:19:11,701 --> 00:19:15,070
of taxes on the call has to satisfy
these war debts like the sugar act,

345
00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:18,330
the Currency Act, and the stamp
act. They also kept the army.

346
00:19:18,330 --> 00:19:19,440
They're following the war,

347
00:19:19,441 --> 00:19:23,070
which the colonists felt was unnecessary
as not only did they massively

348
00:19:23,071 --> 00:19:24,960
outnumber the frontier native Americans,

349
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:29,070
but indeed most male colonist owned guns
and we're expected to be in militias.

350
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:30,690
The quartering act was passed,

351
00:19:30,691 --> 00:19:33,930
which required American colonists to
provide housing for these soldiers.

352
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:37,140
British soldiers could also enter
colonial homes to ensure that they were

353
00:19:37,141 --> 00:19:39,000
following through with these regulations.

354
00:19:39,090 --> 00:19:42,660
The colonists protested these things to
a degree at which officials from nine

355
00:19:42,661 --> 00:19:44,700
colonies met incentive British government,

356
00:19:44,701 --> 00:19:46,890
the declaration of rights in grievances,

357
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:49,800
and I do mean to emphasize
the British government here.

358
00:19:49,801 --> 00:19:53,010
It's not just King George. The third
making the rules, it's parliament as well.

359
00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:55,950
The colonist. We're not angered
about the taxes themselves,

360
00:19:55,951 --> 00:19:58,980
especially considering how much lower
they were in the colonies and they were in

361
00:19:58,981 --> 00:20:02,790
England. They were more angered by the
fact that they had no say in these taxes.

362
00:20:02,791 --> 00:20:06,000
They had no representatives in
parliament or as it's often called,

363
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:09,000
they were mad about taxation
without representation.

364
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:12,120
Parliament actually does end
up repeating the stamp act,

365
00:20:12,121 --> 00:20:15,330
but it's a little relief to the colonies
because they've passed the declaratory

366
00:20:15,331 --> 00:20:16,580
act and the town's index.

367
00:20:16,650 --> 00:20:20,430
Soon thereafter stating that the British
parliament had the same right to rule

368
00:20:20,431 --> 00:20:24,330
over the colonies as a did England in
placing indirect taxes on things like

369
00:20:24,331 --> 00:20:29,190
paper, t and glass and the 17 seven
these protests became more intense

370
00:20:29,790 --> 00:20:33,660
thing, such as the Boston massacre
occurred, which wasn't really a massacre.

371
00:20:33,661 --> 00:20:37,230
It was an exaggeration of an incident
in which British soldiers shot into a

372
00:20:37,231 --> 00:20:39,770
violent crowd that was
deemed self-defense.

373
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:44,880
Three years later in 1773 the Boston
tea party occurred and incident in which

374
00:20:44,881 --> 00:20:48,790
the sons of liberty disguise themselves
as native Americans and toss entire

375
00:20:48,791 --> 00:20:52,450
shipment of t overboard in defiance
of the British. After this,

376
00:20:52,451 --> 00:20:56,050
the British began to crack down even
harder and the colonies began to respond

377
00:20:56,051 --> 00:21:00,820
with even more defiance and in 1774
at least is something called the first

378
00:21:00,821 --> 00:21:02,230
continental congress.

379
00:21:02,830 --> 00:21:06,880
Attending this first congress were men
such as Patrick Henry, Samuel Adams,

380
00:21:06,881 --> 00:21:08,410
and John Adams.
Now,

381
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:11,740
this Congress did not assemble a
start talking about independence.

382
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:14,140
Very few people in fact even
talked about independence.

383
00:21:14,141 --> 00:21:19,141
In cell 1776 it assembled to decide
what to do about an emerging conflict.

384
00:21:19,450 --> 00:21:22,570
Their initial goal was to try to
reason with a British garment,

385
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:23,890
but that essentially failed.

386
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:28,150
This would lead to the second continental
congress in which other figures like

387
00:21:28,151 --> 00:21:30,940
Thomas Jefferson and George Washington,
and to the stage,

388
00:21:31,150 --> 00:21:34,240
the plan was still not initially to
separate from the British empire,

389
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:38,080
but the tries to demand further that
the conditions being met by the British

390
00:21:38,081 --> 00:21:43,081
government possibly even to organize a
colonies into revolt in a spring of 1775

391
00:21:44,021 --> 00:21:44,441
however,

392
00:21:44,441 --> 00:21:48,130
when British soldiers attempted to
seize weaponry from American patriots,

393
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:51,820
the men resisted leading to the
battles of Lexington and Concord.

394
00:21:52,030 --> 00:21:54,130
The first shot was fired at these battles.

395
00:21:54,131 --> 00:21:56,770
Often remember it as the
shot heard round the world,

396
00:21:56,890 --> 00:21:58,300
the British would win the battles,

397
00:21:58,330 --> 00:22:00,850
but it would mark the
beginning of an entire war.

398
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:04,150
British forces began clashing
with American malicious.

399
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:08,890
On June 15th the Continental Congress
officially adopted the Continental Army

400
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:10,960
and put George Washington in charge of it.

401
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:15,490
On July 5th the colonist addressed the
olive branch petition to King George,

402
00:22:15,491 --> 00:22:18,610
the third and an effort to
avoid further escalation of war.

403
00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:23,200
But in August when the proclamation for
suppressing rebellion and sedition was

404
00:22:23,201 --> 00:22:25,270
issued following the
battle of Bunker Hill,

405
00:22:25,390 --> 00:22:29,170
stating that the colonies were in
rebellion and would be subdued by forests,

406
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:33,730
hopes of achieving peace where greatly
diminished war would continue and the

407
00:22:33,731 --> 00:22:34,331
congress,

408
00:22:34,331 --> 00:22:38,170
and in fact the whole nation gradually
just began splitting from the British

409
00:22:38,171 --> 00:22:42,280
empire more and more until on July 4th,

410
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:46,240
1776 the continental congress declared
to the United States was an independent

411
00:22:46,241 --> 00:22:48,250
nation.
It was now all or nothing.

412
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:51,940
The British began sending large amounts
of their own soldiers as well as hiring

413
00:22:51,941 --> 00:22:53,290
mercenaries from Hessia.

414
00:22:53,470 --> 00:22:56,770
British forces would capture New York
from rebel forces and would cause

415
00:22:56,771 --> 00:22:59,380
Washington to retreat with
the British closing in.

416
00:22:59,381 --> 00:23:02,740
They felt that they could win the war
within a year and American morale began to

417
00:23:02,741 --> 00:23:04,000
drop.
However,

418
00:23:04,030 --> 00:23:09,030
on Christmas Day 1776 forces on the
general Washington surprise attack that

419
00:23:09,491 --> 00:23:13,560
British and Hash and forces at the battle
of Trenton and one which encouraged

420
00:23:13,561 --> 00:23:15,610
the rebels to keep going
the following year,

421
00:23:15,611 --> 00:23:18,610
the British would attempt to close in
from the north in what's referred to as a

422
00:23:18,611 --> 00:23:22,840
Saratoga campaign. Though they were
upheld. It was costly in American spirit,

423
00:23:22,841 --> 00:23:25,810
drops his Wyatt and make camp
for the winter and valley forge.

424
00:23:26,110 --> 00:23:30,430
The winter here was very hard on American
troops, but an exiled Prussian officer.

425
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:34,180
The Baron von Steuben
would be instrumental and
shredding American troops and

426
00:23:34,181 --> 00:23:36,790
pressure military tactics.
Up to this point,

427
00:23:36,791 --> 00:23:39,940
much of the success of the American
army was in guerrilla warfare,

428
00:23:39,970 --> 00:23:41,290
but on the open field,

429
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:45,040
Washington was forced to contend with
the fact that he was essentially sending

430
00:23:45,050 --> 00:23:46,190
militias up against

431
00:23:46,190 --> 00:23:49,700
it, better trained and better equipped
to professional army. Interestingly,

432
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:50,960
for unknown reasons,

433
00:23:50,961 --> 00:23:54,980
the British chose not to
attack the American army at
Valley forge had they done

434
00:23:54,981 --> 00:23:58,610
so. It's very possible that the war
could have ended following this winter.

435
00:23:58,611 --> 00:24:00,380
The rebel side received some aid.

436
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:03,470
France now having confidence
in the rebels abilities,

437
00:24:03,770 --> 00:24:06,230
openly allies itself
with the United States,

438
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:08,810
Spain and the Netherlands
would also join the war,

439
00:24:08,811 --> 00:24:11,540
distracting Britain on other fronts.
Now,

440
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:15,560
allied nations being a part of the
American revolution are often only glanced

441
00:24:15,561 --> 00:24:19,220
over or sometimes even,
I hate to say intentionally left out,

442
00:24:19,310 --> 00:24:23,090
but the reality is that without foreign
help, especially from the French,

443
00:24:23,150 --> 00:24:26,870
the American revolution probably would
have failed the American side needed to

444
00:24:26,871 --> 00:24:28,910
funding the supplies and the troops,

445
00:24:28,911 --> 00:24:32,960
especially on a sees as the British at
this time had the most powerful navy on

446
00:24:32,961 --> 00:24:37,010
earth. And as we shall see in some
instances like the battle of Yorktown,

447
00:24:37,011 --> 00:24:38,030
which we'll get to in a second,

448
00:24:38,090 --> 00:24:40,820
there are even more French
soldiers and there are Americans.

449
00:24:41,090 --> 00:24:45,050
The war continued in 1780 the
British found success at Charleston,

450
00:24:45,170 --> 00:24:48,290
but where to feed it in the north
following the battle of Springfield on

451
00:24:48,291 --> 00:24:50,450
September 28th,

452
00:24:50,450 --> 00:24:54,140
1781 the siege of Yorktown begin
the seed with us for a month,

453
00:24:54,141 --> 00:24:58,610
but on October 19th that combined American
and French armies had defeated the

454
00:24:58,611 --> 00:24:59,290
British.

455
00:24:59,290 --> 00:25:04,290
Though the war would continue officially
for two more years until a 1783 this

456
00:25:04,341 --> 00:25:07,250
was the last major battle
with the piece of Paris.

457
00:25:07,251 --> 00:25:10,520
The British would recognize American
sovereignty and seed it to the territory

458
00:25:10,521 --> 00:25:11,660
east of the Mississippi.

459
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:16,160
The United States was now
a fully independent nation
with the British ceiling

460
00:25:16,161 --> 00:25:19,820
home. The American Victor's now found
themselves freed of the old government,

461
00:25:19,850 --> 00:25:22,850
but now faced with a new
challenge building a new one.

462
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,840
It's incorrect to think that the concept
of the United States we have to date

463
00:25:26,841 --> 00:25:28,280
was already in everyone's mind.

464
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:32,420
The government had to walk on eggshells
essentially to avoid further separation

465
00:25:32,421 --> 00:25:33,230
and rebellion.

466
00:25:33,230 --> 00:25:36,920
There was a very real threat of
something like Virginia or Massachusetts

467
00:25:36,921 --> 00:25:39,860
operating as a separate nation
and splitting from the union.

468
00:25:40,250 --> 00:25:45,250
The period of 1783 to 1789 is often
called the confederation period named so

469
00:25:46,071 --> 00:25:49,700
because the United States
was still operating off the
articles of confederation.

470
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:52,460
The articles can federation
left the central government,

471
00:25:52,490 --> 00:25:57,080
which only consisted of a congress week
and without much power to levy taxes,

472
00:25:57,081 --> 00:26:00,380
organized trade, enforce laws,
raise an army, et cetera.

473
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:03,170
Most of the governing was
left to the individual states.

474
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:07,880
Essentially we had the states,
but they weren't fully the United States.

475
00:26:08,150 --> 00:26:11,570
Many of the founding fathers felt that
the only way that the United States can

476
00:26:11,571 --> 00:26:15,230
be held together as a large nation was
if they adopted a new constitution with a

477
00:26:15,231 --> 00:26:18,320
stronger central government with
Shay's rebellion against the corrupt

478
00:26:18,321 --> 00:26:21,020
Massachusetts government and
ineffective American government.

479
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:22,370
The desire grew stronger.

480
00:26:22,670 --> 00:26:27,410
Delegates would reconvene in Philadelphia
in 1787 with the intent of reshaping

481
00:26:27,411 --> 00:26:28,790
the articles of confederation,

482
00:26:28,910 --> 00:26:31,940
but would find themselves instead
writing a new constitution.

483
00:26:32,150 --> 00:26:36,890
The constitution of the United States
after long debate will be past a document

484
00:26:36,891 --> 00:26:39,650
basically lays the foundation
for the United States. Up Today.

485
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:42,230
It organizes the government
into three branches,

486
00:26:42,530 --> 00:26:45,420
the legislative and judicial branches.

487
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:49,650
Each branch was designed to check each
other to ensure democracy and as his

488
00:26:49,651 --> 00:26:53,730
constitution remains one of the shortest
and the world attempted to ensure

489
00:26:53,731 --> 00:26:55,290
limited governmental power,

490
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:58,290
the voting population would elect
to figures to represent them and the

491
00:26:58,291 --> 00:27:02,010
government and it would not really always
directly vote on issues themselves.

492
00:27:02,550 --> 00:27:05,700
The first president of the United
States was George Washington,

493
00:27:05,701 --> 00:27:09,420
who was unanimously elected along
with its vice president John Adams.

494
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:13,620
In 1781 the first 10 amendments were
added to the constitution to limit the

495
00:27:13,621 --> 00:27:17,070
power of the government
further and established a
number of rights and freedoms

496
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:20,610
for the populace and ease concerns
about a central government that was so

497
00:27:20,611 --> 00:27:24,240
powerful. The first protect the
rights of Americans to speech,

498
00:27:24,241 --> 00:27:29,010
religion and organization and protest
the second their right to bear arms to

499
00:27:29,011 --> 00:27:30,810
guard against governmental corruption.

500
00:27:30,990 --> 00:27:34,680
The third preventing the quartering of
soldiers and American homes, et Cetera.

501
00:27:34,890 --> 00:27:38,250
This constitution was not about the
government granting people rights.

502
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:41,850
It's about the people renting
the government to write
their will with a large

503
00:27:41,851 --> 00:27:43,530
number of restrictions
on what it could do.

504
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:46,530
The United States was not the
first democracy in the world.

505
00:27:46,531 --> 00:27:48,660
It was not even the only
democracy at the time.

506
00:27:48,870 --> 00:27:53,120
The British even who are
sometimes portrayed as
tyrannical absolute monarchist

507
00:27:53,370 --> 00:27:56,880
were relative to the rest of Europe.
A fairly democratic nation.

508
00:27:57,060 --> 00:28:00,660
Much of the American revolution was
about not having the same rights,

509
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:03,140
not that these rights were
entirely in existence.

510
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:06,810
There are a number of reasons that the
British didn't just grant the American

511
00:28:06,811 --> 00:28:09,000
colonists equal
representation in parliament,

512
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:13,200
but they mainly boiled down to the
fact that not even most of Britain was

513
00:28:13,201 --> 00:28:14,640
equally represented in parliament.

514
00:28:14,850 --> 00:28:18,690
Giving Americans equal representation
would have caused a bigger situation than

515
00:28:18,691 --> 00:28:21,990
it sounds like. Keep in mind, for
the more at the start of the country,

516
00:28:21,991 --> 00:28:24,510
only about 6% of the
population could vote.

517
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:27,060
This was the population
of white landowning males.

518
00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:31,500
It was not unheard of prior to this for
the wives of landowning males and for

519
00:28:31,501 --> 00:28:33,840
free black men to vote in some situations,

520
00:28:34,230 --> 00:28:37,080
but these reits were eventually
revoked as time went on,

521
00:28:37,081 --> 00:28:38,650
which will be important to understand.

522
00:28:38,651 --> 00:28:42,690
As centuries progress and
the 1790 [inaudible] we see
the United States began to

523
00:28:42,691 --> 00:28:43,950
take a more familiar shape.

524
00:28:44,130 --> 00:28:48,360
The population was about 4 million
people just over one 100th of what it is

525
00:28:48,361 --> 00:28:50,940
today. You had to, this
population was on the move.

526
00:28:51,150 --> 00:28:53,910
A major concern was the
acquired land to the West.

527
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:59,240
The northwest ordinance of 1787 did more
than just establish the first territory

528
00:28:59,281 --> 00:29:00,150
of the United States.

529
00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:04,020
It laid the foundation for how westward
expansion and the eventual admission of

530
00:29:04,021 --> 00:29:05,430
new states could take place.

531
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:09,630
These new territories would eventually
be divided into new states of Ohio,

532
00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:12,300
Michigan, Illinois,
Indiana, and Wisconsin.

533
00:29:12,630 --> 00:29:16,140
We also see the rise of political parties
in the United States. During this time.

534
00:29:16,170 --> 00:29:20,190
The federalists and the Democratic
Republicans with the first a prominent

535
00:29:20,191 --> 00:29:23,010
figurehead of the federalist
was Alexander Hamilton,

536
00:29:23,070 --> 00:29:24,480
the secretary of the Treasury,

537
00:29:24,481 --> 00:29:27,750
who was instrumental in creating the
national bank and structuring American

538
00:29:27,751 --> 00:29:28,440
trade.

539
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:32,160
Thomas Jefferson typically aligned with
the Democratic Republicans who favored a

540
00:29:32,161 --> 00:29:35,730
comparatively more domestically
focused and democratic United States.

541
00:29:35,790 --> 00:29:38,790
When the French Revolution broke
out and became more intense,

542
00:29:38,791 --> 00:29:42,340
the two political parties found
themselves taking unofficial sides.

543
00:29:42,430 --> 00:29:45,940
The federalist who found Brent to be
their most valuable trading partner

544
00:29:45,970 --> 00:29:48,100
supported British efforts against France.

545
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:51,970
A Democratic Republicans were sympathetic
towards similar goals of the French

546
00:29:51,971 --> 00:29:55,210
revolutionaries against their king
and for democracy supported their

547
00:29:55,211 --> 00:30:00,070
revolutionary aims. President Washington
was very much bothered by all of this.

548
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:03,970
He was very much against the concepts of
both political parties at home and the

549
00:30:03,971 --> 00:30:08,110
lions has abroad. The French called upon
the Americans to honor their alliance,

550
00:30:08,111 --> 00:30:13,111
but Washington maintains neutrality when
the Jay Treaty was signed in 1795 which

551
00:30:13,271 --> 00:30:15,940
established Britain as America's
closest trading partner.

552
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:18,490
The US had mildly chosen this side,

553
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:21,760
though this treaty was very unpopular
and the US, as we shall see,

554
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:25,420
isn't that remain on the side mainly
because of British continue to do things

555
00:30:25,421 --> 00:30:29,310
like arming hostile native Americans and
capturing American sailors unfortunate

556
00:30:29,330 --> 00:30:30,910
in to serve and the British navy.

557
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:34,750
It was commonly felt by the government
that the Jay Treaty can be forged and the

558
00:30:34,751 --> 00:30:38,710
one sign in the past with the French
was void because it was signed with the

559
00:30:38,711 --> 00:30:41,260
King of France, not the
French republic. Therefore,

560
00:30:41,261 --> 00:30:44,560
the United States was not obligated
to assist a French militarily.

561
00:30:44,710 --> 00:30:49,270
In 1797 George Washington retired from
his office and the precedent for the

562
00:30:49,271 --> 00:30:52,990
presidents to serve only two terms.
This would later become law.

563
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:56,890
John Adams would succeed him in the
following election with Thomas Jefferson

564
00:30:56,891 --> 00:30:59,230
serving as vice president Adams,

565
00:30:59,231 --> 00:31:02,770
a federalist took stronger federalist
positions and George Washington,

566
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:06,610
but still wanted the United States
to remain for the most part. Neutral.

567
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:12,300
This soon kind of falls apart as failed
negotiations lead to the quasi war with

568
00:31:12,311 --> 00:31:15,280
France and unofficial naval
conflict between the two.

569
00:31:15,610 --> 00:31:18,400
Adams would also pass the
alien and sedition acts,

570
00:31:18,401 --> 00:31:21,860
which made it more difficult
for immigrants to come
into the country and allow

571
00:31:21,861 --> 00:31:25,750
the government to imprison and deport
anyone who is deemed dangerous.

572
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:29,110
Though this included even people
who criticize Adam's presidency,

573
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:31,080
the acts were quickly repealed,

574
00:31:31,090 --> 00:31:35,230
but it just goes to show that some
concepts like free speech weren't firmly

575
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:39,100
indisputably entrenched in American
politics. The concept of America,

576
00:31:39,101 --> 00:31:43,510
yet the quasi war would end when
Napoleon who was more reasonable than the

577
00:31:43,511 --> 00:31:47,170
French revolutionary government came
to power and negotiate peace with the

578
00:31:47,171 --> 00:31:50,530
American diplomats.
There was popular support for war,

579
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:52,210
but both the US and the points,

580
00:31:52,211 --> 00:31:54,490
French empire had many
other things to worry about.

581
00:31:54,710 --> 00:31:59,230
In 1801 Thomas Jefferson
was elected president and he
begins to start changing a

582
00:31:59,231 --> 00:32:02,800
few things around. Jefferson did
not like the federal government.

583
00:32:02,801 --> 00:32:03,670
You're not like banks.

584
00:32:03,671 --> 00:32:07,300
He was a farmer from Virginia and he
was much more sympathetic to the aims of

585
00:32:07,301 --> 00:32:11,230
the majority of the American population
were farmers and the federalists were

586
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:12,760
during his presidency.

587
00:32:12,790 --> 00:32:17,790
The northwest of the nation began to take
shape when Ohio becomes a 17 state in

588
00:32:17,861 --> 00:32:20,380
1803 much more significantly.

589
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:23,860
Napoleon had recently required
the Louisiana from Spain. However,

590
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:25,210
when the French lost Haiti,

591
00:32:25,330 --> 00:32:29,510
Napoleon essentially felt that the rest
of America was useless territory and he

592
00:32:29,511 --> 00:32:31,960
sold at the Jefferson
for a very cheap price.

593
00:32:32,110 --> 00:32:36,370
Essentially purchasing what would become
several future states from France for

594
00:32:36,371 --> 00:32:41,090
what would today be $300 million or
about $23 million estate state. Again,

595
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:42,380
by today's standards,

596
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:46,750
President Jefferson later sends out an
expedition led by men named Merryweather

597
00:32:46,750 --> 00:32:50,420
Lewis and William Clark to explore the
American West and establish relations

598
00:32:50,421 --> 00:32:52,100
with major native American tribes.

599
00:32:52,250 --> 00:32:55,790
They would succeed in doing much of this
with the help up has shown a woman's

600
00:32:55,791 --> 00:32:59,660
secretary [inaudible] though they did
not of course find the northwest passage,

601
00:32:59,750 --> 00:33:04,490
which there were also asked to look
for this and Jefferson speculation that

602
00:33:04,491 --> 00:33:06,920
mastodons could still
live in the American west.

603
00:33:07,010 --> 00:33:11,030
Just goes to show how little Americans
knew of what was in the West.

604
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:15,500
When James Madison became president in
1809 many of the problems and of strains

605
00:33:15,501 --> 00:33:16,700
with Britain still existed.

606
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:20,660
The British was still capturing American
sailors harassing American ships and

607
00:33:20,661 --> 00:33:23,300
arming native Americans
in northwest territory.

608
00:33:23,420 --> 00:33:28,010
Namely a confederation led with
Shawnee chief to comes up in 1812 and

609
00:33:28,011 --> 00:33:31,490
retaliation to these offenses. The United
States with declare war on Britain.

610
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:34,550
The British were far too occupied
by the Napoleonic wars too.

611
00:33:34,551 --> 00:33:38,570
At first launch response, though they were
able to, along with our native allies,

612
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:40,880
hold off American expansion into Canada.

613
00:33:41,090 --> 00:33:44,630
The British would also attempt to blockade
American trade and free and recruit

614
00:33:44,631 --> 00:33:46,700
many American slaves into their armies.

615
00:33:46,910 --> 00:33:50,240
The American army at this time was
not an efficient fighting force.

616
00:33:50,570 --> 00:33:53,720
The concept of a large standing
army was considered dangerous.

617
00:33:53,721 --> 00:33:56,780
Too many Americans at the time,
including Congress. Instead,

618
00:33:56,840 --> 00:34:00,320
much of the American military relied
lied on militias that would be called up

619
00:34:00,321 --> 00:34:01,460
whenever war was a threat.

620
00:34:01,610 --> 00:34:06,110
When Napoleon was defeated in April of
1814 the British were able to focus more

621
00:34:06,111 --> 00:34:09,440
on the war with America.
American forces were overwhelmed.

622
00:34:09,530 --> 00:34:13,010
They were defeated at the battle of
Bladensburg and the British thing captured

623
00:34:13,011 --> 00:34:17,210
Washington DC burning down the White
House and attempting to burn down much of

624
00:34:17,211 --> 00:34:19,700
the city though a heavy
storm put out these fires.

625
00:34:20,330 --> 00:34:22,580
A month later during
the battle of Baltimore,

626
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:26,540
Francis Scott Key would write his
famous poem, the Star spangled banner,

627
00:34:26,630 --> 00:34:30,890
which would later become America's
national anthem in December of 1814 it was

628
00:34:30,891 --> 00:34:33,320
beginning to look as though
the war would end in a draw.

629
00:34:33,620 --> 00:34:37,610
The two sides met in Ghent, Belgium
to form a peace treaty. Accordingly,

630
00:34:37,820 --> 00:34:41,660
fighting would continue even after the
peace treaty was signed as word of it had

631
00:34:41,661 --> 00:34:42,860
not yet reached America,

632
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:46,370
such as the infamous battle of New
Orleans where Andrew Jackson defeated a

633
00:34:46,371 --> 00:34:49,280
fourth in British over three
times as large as the zone.

634
00:34:49,490 --> 00:34:51,350
The war was indeed a truce.

635
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:55,460
Though the United States arguably suffered
more in the British following the war

636
00:34:55,461 --> 00:35:00,140
of 1812 a sense of national pride swept
through the United States road and can

637
00:35:00,141 --> 00:35:04,070
now building to facilitate
trade throughout the nation
and expansion into other

638
00:35:04,071 --> 00:35:08,180
parts of it picked up with particular
emphasis on things like the ability of the

639
00:35:08,181 --> 00:35:12,740
newly invented steamboat soon and the
later 1820s at the introduction of the

640
00:35:12,741 --> 00:35:17,060
railroad will begin to
reshape transportation across
a very large areas of the

641
00:35:17,061 --> 00:35:20,090
United States. Factories would
spring up across the country,

642
00:35:20,091 --> 00:35:24,230
primarily in the north with the south
still focusing more so on agriculture.

643
00:35:24,290 --> 00:35:28,150
Though this advancement in technology
and production did absolutely make this

644
00:35:28,151 --> 00:35:30,080
south of Richard and
more productive as well.

645
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:33,950
These factories were worth by women and
the hundreds of thousands of immigrants

646
00:35:33,951 --> 00:35:37,990
pouring into the nation, redefining
the American workday and work for

647
00:35:37,990 --> 00:35:38,823
us.

648
00:35:38,850 --> 00:35:42,780
All of these innovations as well as others
are part of what is called the market

649
00:35:42,781 --> 00:35:43,560
revolution,

650
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:47,760
which was a result of the industrial
revolution and when pave the way for

651
00:35:47,761 --> 00:35:51,030
America to grow into a much larger power.
As time went on,

652
00:35:51,390 --> 00:35:55,740
hundreds of thousands of settlers were
pouring into the western lands over the

653
00:35:55,740 --> 00:35:55,770
decades,

654
00:35:55,770 --> 00:36:00,360
which would eventually lead to the
concept of manifest destiny that God had

655
00:36:00,361 --> 00:36:03,390
given the America the right to
spread out across a continent.

656
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:08,720
In 1823 we see something called the
Monroe doctrine named after President John

657
00:36:09,030 --> 00:36:12,990
Monroe, essentially stating
that the United States would
not only prohibit future

658
00:36:12,991 --> 00:36:15,450
European colonization and
lands that they had claimed,

659
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:19,230
but in fact the whole hemisphere will
be safe guarded by the United States.

660
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:23,730
The U s was not actually militarily
powerful enough to defend the entire

661
00:36:23,731 --> 00:36:26,820
Americas from multiple European powers.
However,

662
00:36:26,850 --> 00:36:28,830
the British join with
them on this doctrine.

663
00:36:29,340 --> 00:36:33,030
This would mark the beginning of America
coming out of isolation and perhaps

664
00:36:33,031 --> 00:36:36,810
sowed the seeds for the later beginning
of American imperialism powered by,

665
00:36:36,811 --> 00:36:39,060
as we discussed,
the industrial revolution,

666
00:36:39,061 --> 00:36:41,850
which was having grit effects
this new open country.

667
00:36:42,060 --> 00:36:45,180
In 1828 Andrew Jackson
was elected president.

668
00:36:45,450 --> 00:36:49,230
Having had an essentially lifelong
military history and having come from a

669
00:36:49,231 --> 00:36:53,850
poorer family, he was seen as relatable
to the common man. Accordingly,

670
00:36:53,851 --> 00:36:56,400
much of what he did was on
behalf of the common person,

671
00:36:56,401 --> 00:36:59,250
such as opposed in a national banks,
which you felt benefited.

672
00:36:59,251 --> 00:37:03,510
The upperclass is primarily and extending
voting rights to May landless whites.

673
00:37:03,570 --> 00:37:04,200
Jackson,

674
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:07,200
who had been a southerner very active
in conflict with the native Americans,

675
00:37:07,470 --> 00:37:11,820
also signed the Indian removal act, which
intended to move the Cherokee Choctaw,

676
00:37:11,821 --> 00:37:13,110
Muskogee,
Chickasaw,

677
00:37:13,111 --> 00:37:15,960
and Seminole peoples and the
southern states to new territory.

678
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:20,370
Many Americans protested the Indian
removal act as inhumane as it had been,

679
00:37:20,371 --> 00:37:24,000
an intention for many dating back as
early as it founding fathers, in fact,

680
00:37:24,390 --> 00:37:27,630
to attempt to integrate native
Americans in twice society,

681
00:37:27,930 --> 00:37:30,840
but the government went forward with
it leading to what is remembered as the

682
00:37:30,841 --> 00:37:32,160
trail of tears,

683
00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:36,960
the path these natives falled on a forest
relocation to modern day Oklahoma on

684
00:37:36,961 --> 00:37:40,950
which a quarter of them or about
10,000 innocent people would perish.

685
00:37:41,190 --> 00:37:43,950
The Seminole tribe in Florida
specifically, however,

686
00:37:44,010 --> 00:37:47,850
would resist and would lead to the second
seminar war and eventually the third,

687
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:52,260
the 1830s we're a very busy time in
America for other reasons as well,

688
00:37:52,350 --> 00:37:54,630
along with political and
industrial movements.

689
00:37:54,631 --> 00:37:56,670
Social movements like the
second great awakening,

690
00:37:56,671 --> 00:38:00,690
a Protestant bliss movement swept through
the nation as well as a large number

691
00:38:00,691 --> 00:38:04,530
of moments calling for the abolition of
slavery and the roots of the feminist

692
00:38:04,531 --> 00:38:07,920
movement. Public schools would pop up
in the north. However, in the south,

693
00:38:07,921 --> 00:38:12,000
people were skeptical of
government education or it's
with the native Americans

694
00:38:12,001 --> 00:38:17,001
continued in 1835 Texas Rosa from
Mexico directed by American settlers and

695
00:38:17,671 --> 00:38:21,150
declared itself an independent nation.
Only a decade later,

696
00:38:21,180 --> 00:38:23,640
the United States would
admit Texas into union.

697
00:38:23,970 --> 00:38:26,220
The United States didn't laid
their eyes on California,

698
00:38:26,221 --> 00:38:30,030
but the Mexican empire still claims both
Texas and California and the American

699
00:38:30,031 --> 00:38:33,540
invasion is the region would
lead to the Mexican American war.

700
00:38:33,690 --> 00:38:37,270
The war ended within two years when
American forces captured Mexico City and

701
00:38:37,271 --> 00:38:41,500
incorporated territory, which now makes
up much of the southwest. Soon thereafter,

702
00:38:41,530 --> 00:38:45,070
the California gold rush would
commence by securing this territory.

703
00:38:45,071 --> 00:38:49,210
American territory now stretched from the
Atlantic to the Pacific in between the

704
00:38:49,211 --> 00:38:51,700
border is agreed to with
Mexico and British Canada.

705
00:38:51,730 --> 00:38:55,900
The goal is a manifest destiny. It
seemed were coming to fruition. However,

706
00:38:56,140 --> 00:39:00,340
an issue concerning these territories
was whether or not slavery will be legal

707
00:39:00,341 --> 00:39:02,770
in them,
and this was a matter of fierce debate.

708
00:39:03,490 --> 00:39:07,620
Originally align placed here divided
territories that were to be established as

709
00:39:07,621 --> 00:39:09,100
slave holding a free states.

710
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:12,970
Typically as one state on one side of
the line was admitted to the union,

711
00:39:12,971 --> 00:39:16,390
people on the other side would scramble
to make a territory you state to keep it

712
00:39:16,391 --> 00:39:17,830
balanced within congress.

713
00:39:17,890 --> 00:39:21,280
At a time when new states were
frequently being admitted into the union,

714
00:39:21,281 --> 00:39:25,000
it was suggested that these new states
decide for themselves whether or not they

715
00:39:25,001 --> 00:39:27,400
will be slave holding.
This leads to conflict,

716
00:39:27,430 --> 00:39:29,680
even actual fighting
within these new states,

717
00:39:29,681 --> 00:39:34,270
Kansas specifically in the 1850s
this conflict came at a time when,

718
00:39:34,271 --> 00:39:37,120
as I said,
tension over slavery was growing.

719
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:41,950
Books like uncle Tom's cabin began
bringing life of slavery to light and John

720
00:39:41,950 --> 00:39:46,630
Brown slave rebellion, which
failed, sparked fears over
further slave uprisings.

721
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:51,430
In 1804 the Haitians had rebelled
against their slave masters and tortured,

722
00:39:51,431 --> 00:39:53,920
killed and expelled all
whites from the island,

723
00:39:54,220 --> 00:39:58,930
even friendly ones solidifying southern
opinion of abolition and the dangers

724
00:39:58,931 --> 00:40:00,970
they felt that posed.
Yet in a north,

725
00:40:00,971 --> 00:40:04,570
it was commonly felt that a nation which
held slaves could not be considered a

726
00:40:04,571 --> 00:40:08,860
truly free nation. One such northerner
was a man named Abraham Lincoln.

727
00:40:09,070 --> 00:40:14,070
His election to the presidency in 1860
was only 40% of the popular vote leads

728
00:40:14,171 --> 00:40:18,850
the final fight over slavery, the
civil war. Now before we begin here,

729
00:40:18,970 --> 00:40:22,630
there is a lot of the bait as to whether
or not the civil war was fought over

730
00:40:22,631 --> 00:40:26,950
slavery or state's rights and people to
this day are still quite attached to the

731
00:40:26,951 --> 00:40:27,460
issue.

732
00:40:27,460 --> 00:40:31,210
We can see definitely several examples
of strain between the north and south

733
00:40:31,211 --> 00:40:34,600
overstates rise throughout history,
which were not was slavery.

734
00:40:34,690 --> 00:40:39,100
The south was and is indeed different
from the north and a number of ways and

735
00:40:39,101 --> 00:40:43,810
indeed the common person on both sides
was not really concerned about slavery,

736
00:40:43,930 --> 00:40:46,210
but one of the civil war
was quite complicated.

737
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:48,550
The bottom line is without slavery,

738
00:40:48,610 --> 00:40:50,800
the civil war may very well
not have ever happened.

739
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:53,380
Out of the interest of
preserving the union,

740
00:40:53,410 --> 00:40:56,980
Lincoln stated he would not touch
slavery in a places in what had already

741
00:40:56,981 --> 00:40:59,050
existed. Though his intention, the halt,

742
00:40:59,051 --> 00:41:01,660
its expansion into new
territories of the nation.

743
00:41:01,690 --> 00:41:05,590
We're the final straw for the south or
presenting a threat to slavery as a whole.

744
00:41:05,770 --> 00:41:10,690
Before Lincoln even took office, South
Carolina, Florida, Mississippi, Georgia,

745
00:41:10,691 --> 00:41:11,950
Alabama,
Louisiana,

746
00:41:11,951 --> 00:41:16,180
and Texas seceded from the Union and
form the confederate states of America,

747
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:20,050
Georgia and South Carolina had hinted
over the possibility of succeeding from

748
00:41:20,051 --> 00:41:23,710
the union since the revolution
now the union was falling apart.

749
00:41:24,190 --> 00:41:28,150
Conflict did not begin immediately,
but when the south on a president,

750
00:41:28,151 --> 00:41:31,690
Jefferson Davis began demanding
federal property in a territory,

751
00:41:32,020 --> 00:41:36,980
though offering to pay for it. The North
refused. Accordingly, the south attack,

752
00:41:36,981 --> 00:41:41,510
the north held fort Sumpter in South
Carolina. On April 12th, 1860 war,

753
00:41:41,690 --> 00:41:43,010
Virginia,
Arkansas,

754
00:41:43,030 --> 00:41:46,640
North Carolina and Tennessee would
subsequently joined the south as well.

755
00:41:46,790 --> 00:41:50,450
The civil war had begun.
Both sides expected a very short war,

756
00:41:50,451 --> 00:41:52,850
though they each expected
to win the war very quickly.

757
00:41:52,970 --> 00:41:55,970
The North was much more industrial,
much more populated,

758
00:41:56,030 --> 00:42:00,530
had twice the railroads and was better
prepared for war in the south was the

759
00:42:00,531 --> 00:42:03,680
south harbor. Merely had
the fight, a defensive war,

760
00:42:03,681 --> 00:42:05,930
and we're out northern efforts
to recline a territory.

761
00:42:06,060 --> 00:42:09,890
They furthermore felt that
their agricultural wealth
would cause foreign nations

762
00:42:09,891 --> 00:42:13,850
like Britain and France to support them.
Of course, the support that not come.

763
00:42:14,060 --> 00:42:17,360
The first major battle of the war
was the first battle of bull run,

764
00:42:17,361 --> 00:42:20,690
also known as the battle of Manassas,
the confederate victory.

765
00:42:20,690 --> 00:42:24,260
Here we'll begin to foreshadow that the
war will be longer than anticipated.

766
00:42:24,350 --> 00:42:28,100
The union's strategy began with a failed
attempt to capture the confederate

767
00:42:28,101 --> 00:42:29,600
capital of Richmond,
Virginia,

768
00:42:29,601 --> 00:42:32,690
and later evolve the cutoff
to south from outside trade,

769
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:36,050
which meant blockading made your tray
ports it controlling the Mississippi.

770
00:42:36,170 --> 00:42:39,440
The war would soon be divided
into Western and eastern fronts.

771
00:42:39,710 --> 00:42:42,890
In 1862 former US general Robert E.

772
00:42:42,890 --> 00:42:46,490
Lee with affects the confederate side
with a number of confederate successes,

773
00:42:46,491 --> 00:42:47,660
especially in the east.

774
00:42:47,661 --> 00:42:51,200
The prospect of a confederate victory
was becoming more and more realistic for

775
00:42:51,201 --> 00:42:55,640
the first few years of the war in
1863 however, things began to change,

776
00:42:55,880 --> 00:42:59,810
though having enjoyed a decent amount
of victory leaves aggressive strategies

777
00:42:59,811 --> 00:43:04,790
would backfire at the battle
of Gettysburg. In July of
1863, uh, union victory,

778
00:43:04,791 --> 00:43:07,370
which is Optima guarded as
a turning point of the war.

779
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:09,200
The following day on July 4th,

780
00:43:09,201 --> 00:43:13,220
Ulysses s grant captured Vicksburg
subsequently allowing the Union to control

781
00:43:13,221 --> 00:43:17,720
the Mississippi and splitting
the confederacy into grant
was soon made general

782
00:43:17,721 --> 00:43:18,980
of all the union forces.

783
00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:22,760
Confederate goal is to win the war by and
been in north were lost and now how to

784
00:43:22,761 --> 00:43:24,890
fight defensively.
Earlier that year,

785
00:43:24,910 --> 00:43:29,120
Lincoln had issued the emancipation
proclamation and executive order,

786
00:43:29,121 --> 00:43:32,150
which intended to free African slaves,
still enslaved in rebel.

787
00:43:32,151 --> 00:43:36,620
Territory's though not those in union
territory with the confederates on the

788
00:43:36,621 --> 00:43:40,430
defensive to the union's strategy now
was to exhaust confederate supplies and

789
00:43:40,431 --> 00:43:42,560
pin them to hasten the end of the war.

790
00:43:42,890 --> 00:43:46,680
A prime example of this was William
Tecumseh Sherman's march to the sea,

791
00:43:46,681 --> 00:43:49,370
which destroyed one fifth
of all farms in Georgia.

792
00:43:49,550 --> 00:43:54,050
The confederates held out for as
long as possible, but on April 9th,

793
00:43:54,050 --> 00:43:55,280
1865 general Robert E.

794
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:59,030
Lee surrender to general grant at the
Aba Maddix courthouse in Virginia,

795
00:43:59,090 --> 00:44:03,260
the rest of the confederacy would soon
follow the civil war with railroads.

796
00:44:03,320 --> 00:44:07,340
Telegraphs are in cloud warships and other
technologies is considered one of the

797
00:44:07,341 --> 00:44:08,960
first industrial wars.

798
00:44:09,170 --> 00:44:13,250
Foreshadowing the destructiveness that
come in future wars following the war,

799
00:44:13,251 --> 00:44:15,980
the south was left impoverished
by prolonged conflict.

800
00:44:15,980 --> 00:44:18,680
It was not fully able to
sustain the civil war.

801
00:44:18,681 --> 00:44:22,370
It remains the deadliest war ever fought
by Americans and American history with

802
00:44:22,371 --> 00:44:26,750
around 700,000 deaths, a heavy
price to pay, but following the war,

803
00:44:26,780 --> 00:44:31,770
many things changed.
The 13th 14th and 15th amendments passed,

804
00:44:31,771 --> 00:44:35,820
which abolished slavery sell the issues
of African American citizenship and

805
00:44:35,821 --> 00:44:39,690
extended the right to vote to blacks.
But this was very much contested,

806
00:44:39,691 --> 00:44:43,170
especially in the south. As
we will see this. Furthermore,

807
00:44:43,171 --> 00:44:47,010
secure the power of the federal government
over the states and led to a stronger

808
00:44:47,011 --> 00:44:49,680
sense of unity in the country.
Prior to this,

809
00:44:49,740 --> 00:44:53,490
people are more associated with their
individual state, the nation as a whole.

810
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:57,030
People even refer to the
United States as a plural eg.

811
00:44:57,090 --> 00:44:59,820
The United States are moving their army,
not moving.

812
00:44:59,850 --> 00:45:02,310
It's army that changed
following the civil war.

813
00:45:02,490 --> 00:45:05,880
President Lincoln would not live
to see these changes, however,

814
00:45:05,881 --> 00:45:10,881
or the official end of the war as he was
assassinated in Ford's theatre on April

815
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:12,240
14th,

816
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:15,990
1865 he was of course in favor of these
things and though while he is sometimes

817
00:45:15,991 --> 00:45:17,940
seen as the great a massive pater,

818
00:45:18,300 --> 00:45:23,300
he and many in the north felt that
slavery was wrong but did not exactly see

819
00:45:23,641 --> 00:45:28,380
blacks as equals. Many Americans were
not opposed returning the former slaves,

820
00:45:28,390 --> 00:45:29,430
the nation of origin,

821
00:45:29,431 --> 00:45:32,970
rather than deal with what they felt
would be trouble from integrating blacks

822
00:45:32,971 --> 00:45:36,420
into white society.
Specifically the country of Liberia,

823
00:45:36,450 --> 00:45:41,220
America's only colony in
Africa established in 1820s
as a home for freed African

824
00:45:41,221 --> 00:45:44,400
slaves. But for now at this time,
independent nation. However,

825
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:47,700
the most would of course
remain in the United States.

826
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:51,060
In the next video we will
discuss how this all unfolds,

827
00:45:51,120 --> 00:45:54,960
what happens from here and how the United
States is able to reassemble itself
