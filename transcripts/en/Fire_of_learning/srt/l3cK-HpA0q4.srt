1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:04,080
Humans are having a major impact on the
earth's climate and not much of it is

2
00:00:04,081 --> 00:00:05,410
good for us.

3
00:00:05,411 --> 00:00:08,910
Disappear species go extinct and we've
already raised the Earth's temperature by

4
00:00:08,911 --> 00:00:12,510
about one degree Celsius. That might
not seem like a lot, but it is.

5
00:00:12,511 --> 00:00:16,680
It's a huge jump in just the past 250
years and scientists and world leaders

6
00:00:16,681 --> 00:00:20,160
have agreed that two degrees Celsius
is the upper limit before four things

7
00:00:20,161 --> 00:00:22,050
become more intense.

8
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:27,380
Yet we're predicted to reach four degrees
Celsius by the year 2100 faced with

9
00:00:27,511 --> 00:00:28,470
this information,

10
00:00:28,471 --> 00:00:33,450
many of us show concern
yet find frustration with
government were slow to act

11
00:00:33,451 --> 00:00:36,000
and corporations who
are even slower to act.

12
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:40,950
So here are 10 ways that you
can take action. Number one,

13
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:45,360
reduce electricity when you're not using
something such as lights or computer,

14
00:00:45,361 --> 00:00:50,100
your television, etc. Turn it off.
Furthermore, if not inconvenient,

15
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:52,170
unplug it as low.
Your lights may be off.

16
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:56,220
They may still use energy if
they're plugged in this method,

17
00:00:56,221 --> 00:00:57,510
like many other methods,

18
00:00:57,511 --> 00:01:02,400
we will mention in this video we'll also
help you save money. Number two, recycle.

19
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:07,440
This is an obvious but overlooks method.
We're using plastic, paper, cardboard,

20
00:01:07,441 --> 00:01:08,910
glass, metal, et Cetera.

21
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:12,630
We'll save huge amounts in the energy
that was expended in harvesting these

22
00:01:12,631 --> 00:01:16,440
resources, which if not
recycled, may simply go to waste.

23
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:20,220
If you don't have neighborhood recycling
final recycling center near you,

24
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:23,820
this will reduce landfill pollution,
deforestation,

25
00:01:23,821 --> 00:01:27,060
and many other harmful things to
our environment. Number three,

26
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:30,120
buy local food or grow your own.
Not only this,

27
00:01:30,121 --> 00:01:32,790
transporting food critic
significant amount of pollution,

28
00:01:32,791 --> 00:01:36,270
but industrial agriculture also
release this as a significant amount of

29
00:01:36,271 --> 00:01:39,330
greenhouse gas and pesticides
harmful to the environment.

30
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:44,070
Buying local food or having a garden is
a healthy choice for both you and the

31
00:01:44,071 --> 00:01:47,550
environment. Number four,
use reusable water bottles.

32
00:01:47,730 --> 00:01:49,320
Instead of buying water bottles,

33
00:01:49,321 --> 00:01:52,470
you use a reusable wants
to cut down on plastic use.

34
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:55,740
Most bottled water is not that
much healthier than tap water,

35
00:01:55,741 --> 00:01:56,850
but if you're still concerned,

36
00:01:56,851 --> 00:02:00,900
I would recommend buying a water filter
and just try to make sure that this

37
00:02:00,910 --> 00:02:05,820
water bottle is BPA free as BPA has
been linked to cancer. Number Five,

38
00:02:05,821 --> 00:02:07,830
change your transportation habits.

39
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:11,550
Millions of people traveling from place
to place each day as responsible for a

40
00:02:11,551 --> 00:02:15,990
huge amounts of greenhouse gas emission.
Considered driving instead of flying.

41
00:02:15,991 --> 00:02:19,320
Consider taking public
transportation instead of driving.

42
00:02:19,321 --> 00:02:23,700
Consider walking or riding a bike as your
best way to not produce greenhouse gas

43
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:27,510
and stay in shape. Number six,
consider using a clothes line.

44
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:29,520
It may seem old fashioned,

45
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:33,420
but your washer and dryer are some of
the biggest consumers of energy in your

46
00:02:33,421 --> 00:02:34,254
house.

47
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:38,520
Cuts down on this energy use by letting
your clothes dry out in the sun.

48
00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:42,150
Number seven, keep warm with
clothing or blankets in the winter.

49
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:45,960
Consider turning your thermostat down
and cooler temperatures and instead

50
00:02:45,961 --> 00:02:49,530
wearing warmer clothing each
degree above 70 degrees Fahrenheit,

51
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:53,160
maybe responsible for around
7% of extra energy output.

52
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:58,410
Number eight's grow plants. Plants not
only turned carbon dioxide into oxygen,

53
00:02:58,411 --> 00:03:02,560
but much of the plant itself is made
out of carbon taken from the air.

54
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:04,630
Having indoor or outdoor plants,

55
00:03:04,631 --> 00:03:08,830
letting your yard go out a little bit or
finding a space to plant a tree are all

56
00:03:08,831 --> 00:03:12,970
excellent ways of helping.
Number nine, reduce water usage.

57
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:17,560
Wasted water is especially bad for the
environment in many parts of the world.

58
00:03:17,561 --> 00:03:19,350
Can't afford to wastewater.

59
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:23,110
Turn off water when you're not using it
and try to use as little as possible by

60
00:03:23,111 --> 00:03:24,610
turning off on use faucets,

61
00:03:24,611 --> 00:03:29,440
reducing shower times of five to 10
minutes and running dishwashers or washing

62
00:03:29,441 --> 00:03:33,520
machines. Only one completely
full. Number 10 get involved.

63
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:37,570
Finding local organizations dedicated to
protecting the environment by reducing

64
00:03:37,571 --> 00:03:38,770
greenhouse gas emissions.

65
00:03:38,771 --> 00:03:43,000
Protecting forests and endangered species
and more is a great way to increase

66
00:03:43,001 --> 00:03:46,480
your positive environmental influence.
Contacting politicians,

67
00:03:46,481 --> 00:03:50,830
protesting and raising awareness
are all effective ways of change.

68
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:54,310
By implementing these methods,
we can make a difference.

69
00:03:54,311 --> 00:03:58,870
As real change starts with the
individual person taking action together,

70
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:03,100
we can save our planet for more
videos on a wide range of subjects.

71
00:04:03,101 --> 00:04:06,250
I would invite you to check out the rest
of fire of learning at subscribed to

72
00:04:06,251 --> 00:04:09,400
see more of these videos in the future.
Thank you for watching.
