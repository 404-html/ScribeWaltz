1
00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:01,263
Oh,

2
00:00:17,710 --> 00:00:20,370
the followings was a military
formation of infantry armor.

3
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:24,550
The spirits developed by the Greeks and
you use an ancient warfare and comes

4
00:00:24,551 --> 00:00:27,880
from the word for long Joe's
meaning finger, which is
also where we get to work.

5
00:00:27,881 --> 00:00:28,960
Phalanges and English.

6
00:00:28,961 --> 00:00:32,840
Anatomy is the earliest use of
spirit formations like the felons,

7
00:00:32,841 --> 00:00:34,000
but it's not Greek.
However,

8
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:38,560
there is evidence that the Sumerians
Egyptians and many other civilizations use

9
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:41,110
spear like formations like the Phalynx.
However,

10
00:00:41,111 --> 00:00:43,910
it was arguably perfected by
the Greeks and Macedonian.

11
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:46,180
Here's how it works.

12
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:50,020
Armored soldiers get together and close
file and the front row walks their

13
00:00:50,021 --> 00:00:50,771
shields together,

14
00:00:50,771 --> 00:00:55,660
forming a wall next to first few front
rows would point their spears forward to

15
00:00:55,661 --> 00:01:00,040
creating rows of them. The fellas would
then advance and a strong slow pace.

16
00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:05,680
The Shield wall protected against other
infantry and projectiles while the

17
00:01:05,681 --> 00:01:09,820
spirits protected against cavalry and
infantry Feliks was not invincible.

18
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:14,800
Though it was most effective in flat
terrain and if broken even for a short

19
00:01:14,801 --> 00:01:16,750
duration,
the formation can be doomed.

20
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:22,900
The most famous success of the fellas
was that the battle of marathon in 490 BC

21
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:26,620
here, 11,000 Greeks. If feed
a 26,000 invading Persians,

22
00:01:26,621 --> 00:01:31,621
but this formation there was also the
battle of Thermopylae and 480 BC where the

23
00:01:31,871 --> 00:01:36,871
300 Spartans along with the list famous
700 thespians and 400 Stevens held off

24
00:01:37,511 --> 00:01:40,300
the advancing Persian
force using this formation.

25
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:43,370
There was also the Macedonian fellings.

26
00:01:43,390 --> 00:01:48,390
He goes by Phillip to second of
Mastodon and his son Alexander the Great

27
00:01:48,490 --> 00:01:49,610
Alexander the great uses felling said,

28
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:52,900
conquered the Persian empire and created
one of the greatest empires of his day.

29
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:56,980
Eventually though, by the time
of the Roman invasion of Greece,

30
00:01:57,220 --> 00:01:59,530
the felling have become
less and less effective.

31
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:04,000
Emperor Caracalla of Rome did actually
try to create a felling snow third

32
00:02:04,001 --> 00:02:07,810
century Aidy by making a regimen
of 10,000 Macedonian men,

33
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:11,350
but afterwards it had
fallen in the history.
