00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:01.043
<v Speaker 1>If you had to bet on the next </v>
<v Speaker 1>presidential election based on one </v>

2
00:00:03.001 --> 00:00:04.110
<v Speaker 1>trait,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what would you pick?</v>

3
00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:05.430
<v Speaker 1>Wealth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hair,</v>

4
00:00:05.431 --> 00:00:06.960
<v Speaker 1>color,</v>
<v Speaker 1>family history,</v>

5
00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:09.480
<v Speaker 1>illuminati membership size of their </v>
<v Speaker 1>super pack,</v>

6
00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:11.720
<v Speaker 1>maybe size of their hands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

7
00:00:11.721 --> 00:00:12.554
<v Speaker 1>Professor Greg are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Marie has the answer to this in his </v>

8
00:00:14.011 --> 00:00:16.740
<v Speaker 1>paper on how physical traits affect our </v>
<v Speaker 1>choices in leaders.</v>

9
00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.510
<v Speaker 1>Marie found that from 1789 to 2012,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you had bet on the taller candidate,</v>

10
00:00:21.511 --> 00:00:24.060
<v Speaker 1>you would have been right 58 percent of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the time.</v>

11
00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.700
<v Speaker 1>That alone should probably be the end of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the video.</v>

12
00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.820
<v Speaker 1>Fifty eight percent isn't insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Advantage if you consider that height,</v>

13
00:00:29.821 --> 00:00:30.654
<v Speaker 1>has nothing to do with actual knowledge </v>
<v Speaker 1>of how to run a country or foreign </v>

14
00:00:33.031 --> 00:00:33.864
<v Speaker 1>policy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So with that we should be able to exit </v>

15
00:00:35.131 --> 00:00:35.964
<v Speaker 1>out of this video.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sad that our elections have been so </v>

16
00:00:37.351 --> 00:00:39.960
<v Speaker 1>extensively hijacked by biological </v>
<v Speaker 1>prejudices,</v>

17
00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:41.063
<v Speaker 1>but unfortunately it doesn't stop there </v>
<v Speaker 1>because our data set isn't a complete </v>

18
00:00:44.191 --> 00:00:44.880
<v Speaker 1>picture yet.</v>

19
00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:45.713
<v Speaker 1>Nobody decided their vote based on </v>
<v Speaker 1>height before the television because </v>

20
00:00:48.181 --> 00:00:50.640
<v Speaker 1>they couldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They voted based only on what they heard</v>

21
00:00:50.641 --> 00:00:51.474
<v Speaker 1>from the radio and news only since 1960.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we had televised debates where the </v>

22
00:00:54.841 --> 00:00:56.880
<v Speaker 1>voters have been able to clearly tell </v>
<v Speaker 1>who is color.</v>

23
00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:57.893
<v Speaker 1>So if we separate out these data sets </v>
<v Speaker 1>into before television and after </v>

24
00:01:00.091 --> 00:01:01.740
<v Speaker 1>television,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we find two things.</v>

25
00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:02.993
<v Speaker 1>First in the elections before 1960,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our assumptions that they were </v>

26
00:01:05.581 --> 00:01:07.590
<v Speaker 1>unaffected by height turns out to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>true.</v>

27
00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:08.663
<v Speaker 1>The odds of the taller candidate winning</v>
<v Speaker 1>drops to 51 percent as we would expect </v>

28
00:01:11.491 --> 00:01:14.100
<v Speaker 1>if people not able to see their </v>
<v Speaker 1>candidates before voting for them.</v>

29
00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.620
<v Speaker 1>Secondly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in our post television data set,</v>

30
00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.930
<v Speaker 1>our biological prejudices are worse than</v>
<v Speaker 1>we thought.</v>

31
00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:20.243
<v Speaker 1>From 1960 to 2016,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the taller candidate has won 67 percent </v>

32
00:01:24.361 --> 00:01:25.710
<v Speaker 1>of the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Also,</v>

33
00:01:25.711 --> 00:01:28.350
<v Speaker 1>if one candidate is more than three </v>
<v Speaker 1>inches taller than the other,</v>

34
00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.990
<v Speaker 1>their chances of winning go up to 83 </v>
<v Speaker 1>percent.</v>

35
00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:32.273
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's absolutely insane that height </v>

36
00:01:33.901 --> 00:01:37.260
<v Speaker 1>matters this much to our elections.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But although this is a bit depressing,</v>

37
00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.050
<v Speaker 1>it is in line with what we know about </v>
<v Speaker 1>behavioral psychology.</v>

38
00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.270
<v Speaker 1>There are many theories on why we like </v>
<v Speaker 1>color leaders.</v>

39
00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:43.163
<v Speaker 1>Some studies say height is an advantage </v>
<v Speaker 1>in fights because it means you're </v>

40
00:01:45.181 --> 00:01:46.014
<v Speaker 1>punching down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which generates more forced and makes </v>

41
00:01:47.221 --> 00:01:49.560
<v Speaker 1>you a better fighter and a primitive </v>
<v Speaker 1>setting.</v>

42
00:01:49.561 --> 00:01:52.710
<v Speaker 1>This is how you would elect a leader.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The strongest man would eventually win.</v>

43
00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:53.993
<v Speaker 1>Other theories suggest that we pick our </v>
<v Speaker 1>leaders based on who we physically look </v>

44
00:01:56.071 --> 00:01:57.620
<v Speaker 1>up to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Think of when you're a child,</v>

45
00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:58.473
<v Speaker 1>your peers are always those who are </v>
<v Speaker 1>generally around your height and the </v>

46
00:02:00.361 --> 00:02:01.194
<v Speaker 1>adults.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The people who know stuff are the ones </v>

47
00:02:02.971 --> 00:02:03.804
<v Speaker 1>that are taller and bigger than you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's possible that we never get rid of </v>

48
00:02:05.971 --> 00:02:06.804
<v Speaker 1>that bias when we grow up and see people</v>
<v Speaker 1>who are taller as being authority </v>

49
00:02:09.031 --> 00:02:11.400
<v Speaker 1>figures,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but no matter the explanation,</v>

50
00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:13.980
<v Speaker 1>one thing is clear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We want a leader who can draw the center</v>

51
00:02:13.981 --> 00:02:16.290
<v Speaker 1>of attention and dominate a room </v>
<v Speaker 1>physically.</v>

52
00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:17.753
<v Speaker 1>We perceive them to be better suited for</v>
<v Speaker 1>the job regardless of whether that is </v>

53
00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:23.330
<v Speaker 1>actually true or not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We always look to the tall guy,</v>

54
00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:24.803
<v Speaker 1>so if you want to know who the next </v>
<v Speaker 1>president will be when the election </v>

55
00:02:26.311 --> 00:02:27.480
<v Speaker 1>cycle rolls around,</v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

56
00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:31.710
<v Speaker 1>it might be worth meeting the debate and</v>
<v Speaker 1>just checking who is looking up to who.</v>
