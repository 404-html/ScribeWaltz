00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.940
<v Speaker 1>You and I both know that the title of </v>
<v Speaker 1>this video is a lie.</v>

2
00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:05.490
<v Speaker 1>I'm never going to delete it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but nonetheless,</v>

3
00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:07.620
<v Speaker 1>you clicked on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On the odd chance I do delete it.</v>

4
00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:08.513
<v Speaker 1>You get to be part of the lucky few that</v>
<v Speaker 1>gets to see this video before it </v>

5
00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:11.543
<v Speaker 1>disappears into the void,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's what we're going to talk </v>

6
00:00:13.621 --> 00:00:14.454
<v Speaker 1>about today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That feeling of scarcity and </v>

7
00:00:15.781 --> 00:00:19.320
<v Speaker 1>specifically how people market to that </v>
<v Speaker 1>scarcity to make you look at things,</v>

8
00:00:19.321 --> 00:00:20.154
<v Speaker 1>want things and buy things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever noticed how much </v>

9
00:00:23.011 --> 00:00:25.440
<v Speaker 1>advertisers talk about limits and </v>
<v Speaker 1>urgency?</v>

10
00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:30.720
<v Speaker 2>We live the thrill of beating the clock.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Any sized soft drinks for a dollar won't</v>

11
00:00:30.721 --> 00:00:32.010
<v Speaker 2>stick around long.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Buy One,</v>

12
00:00:32.011 --> 00:00:34.800
<v Speaker 2>get one free this Friday and Saturday,</v>
<v Speaker 2>only October.</v>

13
00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.890
<v Speaker 2>Hurry in now to October savings end </v>
<v Speaker 2>soon.</v>

14
00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:40.950
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why do advertisers do this?</v>

15
00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:43.590
<v Speaker 2>Some of you may feel that this is merely</v>
<v Speaker 2>incidental.</v>

16
00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:45.300
<v Speaker 2>All good things come to an end after </v>
<v Speaker 2>all,</v>

17
00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:46.613
<v Speaker 2>but that isn't quite true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Companies deliberately want to send you </v>

18
00:00:49.141 --> 00:00:49.974
<v Speaker 2>the message that this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this incredible deal won't be here for </v>

19
00:00:52.381 --> 00:00:53.214
<v Speaker 2>long because the reason we want things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the reason we buy things often has very </v>

20
00:00:56.521 --> 00:00:57.354
<v Speaker 2>little to do with the product and </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything to do with how the ad makes </v>

21
00:00:59.671 --> 00:01:00.504
<v Speaker 2>us feel and selling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Scarcity is all about making you and I </v>

22
00:01:03.331 --> 00:01:04.164
<v Speaker 2>feel like we've been given opportunity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Opportunity is not the same as being </v>

23
00:01:07.651 --> 00:01:10.230
<v Speaker 2>given a choice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Opportunity is a choice,</v>

24
00:01:10.231 --> 00:01:13.470
<v Speaker 2>but it has a special component.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a time bound choice.</v>

25
00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:16.380
<v Speaker 2>It has to be seized.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It won't be there for long.</v>

26
00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:17.453
<v Speaker 2>It forces action.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can have this product at this </v>

27
00:01:19.651 --> 00:01:22.380
<v Speaker 2>specially discounted rate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the deal ends this weekend.</v>

28
00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:23.483
<v Speaker 2>It forces you to say yes or no to a deal</v>
<v Speaker 2>because inaction is a choice and it may </v>

29
00:01:29.341 --> 00:01:30.174
<v Speaker 2>surprise you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but this is different from our normal </v>

30
00:01:31.381 --> 00:01:33.210
<v Speaker 2>behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Think about when you're in a store.</v>

31
00:01:33.211 --> 00:01:35.880
<v Speaker 2>Normally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Usually when you pass up on a product,</v>

32
00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:36.923
<v Speaker 2>you're not actually saying no to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're just saying maybe later we do </v>

33
00:01:40.201 --> 00:01:41.034
<v Speaker 2>this all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're procrastinators by nature and if </v>

34
00:01:43.381 --> 00:01:44.214
<v Speaker 2>allowed will shop around for awhile </v>
<v Speaker 2>because the implication with most goods </v>

35
00:01:47.131 --> 00:01:50.460
<v Speaker 2>and services is that they're going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>still be there when you come back,</v>

36
00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.580
<v Speaker 2>but with limited time or limited </v>
<v Speaker 2>quantity sales,</v>

37
00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.300
<v Speaker 2>the goal is to remove the option of </v>
<v Speaker 2>saying maybe a later to an object.</v>

38
00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:58.433
<v Speaker 2>He'd forces action,</v>
<v Speaker 2>say yes and buy it or say no and kiss </v>

39
00:02:01.141 --> 00:02:06.120
<v Speaker 2>this deal goodbye forever and this is a </v>
<v Speaker 2>fundamental change and can push you from</v>

40
00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:06.983
<v Speaker 2>uncertainty to buying a product out of </v>
<v Speaker 2>fear that it will be gone if you come </v>

41
00:02:10.081 --> 00:02:13.830
<v Speaker 2>back later and just how effective is </v>
<v Speaker 2>this form of marketing?</v>

42
00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:15.810
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's look at Amazon,</v>

43
00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.480
<v Speaker 2>the largest distributor in store in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>

44
00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:22.350
<v Speaker 2>What does the most successful store do </v>
<v Speaker 2>you when it puts on huge sales,</v>

45
00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.610
<v Speaker 2>it put scarcity marketing to work and </v>
<v Speaker 2>from two different angles.</v>

46
00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:29.970
<v Speaker 2>Look at this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is not only a limited time sale and</v>

47
00:02:29.971 --> 00:02:33.600
<v Speaker 2>it's not only a limited quantity sale,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's both and when it's done,</v>

48
00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:34.463
<v Speaker 2>it's done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This one little web widget that tracks </v>

49
00:02:37.081 --> 00:02:37.914
<v Speaker 2>how much of the product has moved and </v>
<v Speaker 2>tracks how much time has passed moves </v>

50
00:02:41.041 --> 00:02:43.770
<v Speaker 2>product like crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Take for instance,</v>

51
00:02:43.771 --> 00:02:47.370
<v Speaker 2>this seller who during a four hour </v>
<v Speaker 2>lightning sales sold over 6,000</v>

52
00:02:47.371 --> 00:02:51.150
<v Speaker 2>units when they normally would have sold</v>
<v Speaker 2>four to $500 in a given day.</v>

53
00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:52.343
<v Speaker 2>That's a 1300 percent increase in sales </v>
<v Speaker 2>for taking 20 percent off the price and </v>

54
00:02:55.591 --> 00:02:58.830
<v Speaker 2>putting it on the lightning page or to </v>
<v Speaker 2>put that in business.</v>

55
00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:03.250
<v Speaker 2>So what does consumer psychology have to</v>
<v Speaker 2>say about this?</v>

56
00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:04.413
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's react in theory and there's </v>

57
00:03:05.411 --> 00:03:06.244
<v Speaker 2>commodity react.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In theory developed by Jack Brown says </v>

58
00:03:09.161 --> 00:03:09.994
<v Speaker 2>that when an individual's freedom to </v>
<v Speaker 2>engage in a specific behavior is </v>

59
00:03:12.641 --> 00:03:13.474
<v Speaker 2>threatened,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the threatened behavior becomes more </v>

60
00:03:15.401 --> 00:03:16.960
<v Speaker 2>attractive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is why,</v>

61
00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:17.823
<v Speaker 2>for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when politicians mentioned gun control </v>

62
00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:20.883
<v Speaker 2>ammunition flies off the shelves because</v>
<v Speaker 2>gun owners are worried about their </v>

63
00:03:23.351 --> 00:03:24.184
<v Speaker 2>future ability to buy it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's also why this video title is so </v>

64
00:03:26.711 --> 00:03:29.320
<v Speaker 2>provocative because I'm threatening to </v>
<v Speaker 2>take it away from you.</v>

65
00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:32.950
<v Speaker 2>The other theory we're going to explore </v>
<v Speaker 2>is commodity theory.</v>

66
00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:37.180
<v Speaker 2>This idea developed by brock and fromkin</v>
<v Speaker 2>suggests that goods which appeared to be</v>

67
00:03:37.181 --> 00:03:39.610
<v Speaker 2>scarce are considered to be more </v>
<v Speaker 2>valuable.</v>

68
00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:43.630
<v Speaker 2>This is the idea behind diamonds which </v>
<v Speaker 2>are actually not rare at all,</v>

69
00:03:43.631 --> 00:03:44.464
<v Speaker 2>but due to a very tightly controlled </v>
<v Speaker 2>supply have artificially sustain the </v>

70
00:03:47.381 --> 00:03:48.214
<v Speaker 2>high price point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when marketing companies tell you </v>

71
00:03:50.231 --> 00:03:51.420
<v Speaker 2>that something isn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>soon,</v>

72
00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:52.393
<v Speaker 2>they're trying to artificially restrict </v>
<v Speaker 2>the supply to raise the value in your </v>

73
00:03:55.691 --> 00:03:56.620
<v Speaker 2>mind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

74
00:03:56.621 --> 00:03:57.454
<v Speaker 2>I think a mixture of both of these </v>
<v Speaker 2>theories come into play in shaping how </v>

75
00:03:59.741 --> 00:04:02.380
<v Speaker 2>we respond to perceived scarcity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but either way,</v>

76
00:04:02.381 --> 00:04:03.110
<v Speaker 2>scarcity</v>

77
00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:07.070
<v Speaker 3>plays on our ancient impulses to take </v>
<v Speaker 3>advantage of limited resources.</v>

78
00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:12.890
<v Speaker 3>And this idea hits particularly close to</v>
<v Speaker 3>home for me because as some of you know,</v>

79
00:04:12.891 --> 00:04:13.724
<v Speaker 3>I work a sales job selling houses as my </v>
<v Speaker 3>main nine to five job and when we run </v>

80
00:04:17.331 --> 00:04:18.164
<v Speaker 3>promotionals,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we do it to generate this exact kind of </v>

81
00:04:20.211 --> 00:04:21.044
<v Speaker 3>feeling I've been talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because when people want to take their </v>

82
00:04:23.691 --> 00:04:24.524
<v Speaker 3>time and mull over a decision,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it can lead them to buying nothing at </v>

83
00:04:27.081 --> 00:04:29.210
<v Speaker 3>all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So to get a positional advantage,</v>

84
00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:33.170
<v Speaker 3>we run promos periodically to get the </v>
<v Speaker 3>leverage to say enough thinking.</v>

85
00:04:33.171 --> 00:04:35.360
<v Speaker 3>It's time to make a decision.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

86
00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:37.280
<v Speaker 3>you do want to take advantage of this </v>
<v Speaker 3>big sale,</v>

87
00:04:37.281 --> 00:04:39.320
<v Speaker 3>don't you?</v>
<v Speaker 3>In reality,</v>

88
00:04:39.321 --> 00:04:42.560
<v Speaker 3>is there any reason the house houses </v>
<v Speaker 3>should be less expensive that month?</v>

89
00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:43.753
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we want people to think there is </v>

90
00:04:45.501 --> 00:04:46.334
<v Speaker 3>because it creates urgency.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Our reaction to scarcity is a powerful </v>

91
00:04:50.361 --> 00:04:51.194
<v Speaker 3>force in advertising and marketing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It plays on one of our most fundamental </v>

92
00:04:54.351 --> 00:04:56.840
<v Speaker 3>instincts to not miss out on </v>
<v Speaker 3>opportunity,</v>

93
00:04:57.170 --> 00:04:58.003
<v Speaker 3>and this bias is exploited constantly by</v>
<v Speaker 3>businesses who use advertising and </v>

94
00:05:01.041 --> 00:05:03.770
<v Speaker 3>marketing tactics to create artificial </v>
<v Speaker 3>scarcity.</v>

95
00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:07.610
<v Speaker 3>So just as a rule of thumb,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you live in a developed country where</v>

96
00:05:07.611 --> 00:05:10.130
<v Speaker 3>abundance is the norm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>rather than the exception,</v>

97
00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:11.143
<v Speaker 3>you can begin to safely make the </v>
<v Speaker 3>assumption that if someone is telling </v>

98
00:05:13.461 --> 00:05:14.294
<v Speaker 3>you supplies are low,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're probably trying to sell you </v>

99
00:05:16.491 --> 00:05:17.324
<v Speaker 3>something.</v>
