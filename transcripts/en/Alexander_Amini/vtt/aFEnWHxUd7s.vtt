1
00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:03.473
<v Speaker 1>Thank you for the invitation and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>glad to give up through then </v>

2
00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:06.543
<v Speaker 1>presentation or Basil Confederation </v>
<v Speaker 1>meets a title as come to a vision meets </v>

3
00:00:09.961 --> 00:00:13.140
<v Speaker 1>social media social network.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Actually a worry in this slice,</v>

4
00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:13.983
<v Speaker 1>I were introduced to the works that we </v>
<v Speaker 1>have down in tens and Alf and as this </v>

5
00:00:17.731 --> 00:00:22.230
<v Speaker 1>techniques is one or some research </v>
<v Speaker 1>topics in our labs and as a,</v>

6
00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:27.390
<v Speaker 1>this topics can be shifted with the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the product of our company.</v>

7
00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:28.463
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First I will give our introduction of </v>

8
00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:33.900
<v Speaker 1>brief introduction of our company.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm never sure whether have you heard</v>

9
00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:36.240
<v Speaker 1>tensen before?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Actually 10 center is,</v>

10
00:00:36.241 --> 00:00:38.610
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the largest internet company.</v>

11
00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.550
<v Speaker 1>I think I can say that not only man of </v>
<v Speaker 1>China,</v>

12
00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:44.640
<v Speaker 1>either on all over the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this is the one of the largest,</v>

13
00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:50.120
<v Speaker 1>if not the company and the market </v>
<v Speaker 1>capitalized is 500 billion US dollars.</v>

14
00:00:50.371 --> 00:00:51.204
<v Speaker 1>So I think that even comparable with </v>
<v Speaker 1>facebook or even larger than facebook </v>

15
00:00:55.801 --> 00:00:56.634
<v Speaker 1>and in sometimes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and also we have several products and </v>

16
00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:02.220
<v Speaker 1>several,</v>
<v Speaker 1>several trends for the most important.</v>

17
00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:04.290
<v Speaker 1>One is a social,</v>
<v Speaker 1>social,</v>

18
00:01:04.291 --> 00:01:06.120
<v Speaker 1>not social media,</v>
<v Speaker 1>social network.</v>

19
00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.780
<v Speaker 1>So we have wechat and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they say which are also,</v>

20
00:01:09.781 --> 00:01:13.410
<v Speaker 1>we call the wishing in Chinese.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we chat and Oscar Qq.</v>

21
00:01:13.411 --> 00:01:16.710
<v Speaker 1>So this is a two types of instant </v>
<v Speaker 1>messenger or something like that.</v>

22
00:01:16.711 --> 00:01:21.711
<v Speaker 1>Facebook and Instagram,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean us and also we have games and the</v>

23
00:01:22.651 --> 00:01:23.484
<v Speaker 1>tencent games is the largest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's the number one game </v>

24
00:01:27.511 --> 00:01:28.344
<v Speaker 1>company with have the ratio of you in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the USA with the over 10 billion US </v>

25
00:01:33.271 --> 00:01:37.710
<v Speaker 1>dollars in 2016.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we have several,</v>

26
00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.893
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe someone is familiar with summer a </v>

27
00:01:40.261 --> 00:01:44.550
<v Speaker 1>sale or should we have already acquired </v>
<v Speaker 1>80% of the officers shares.</v>

28
00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.520
<v Speaker 1>So this is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we think that we are the largest.</v>

29
00:01:47.521 --> 00:01:48.354
<v Speaker 1>We,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we are the owners are the eight </v>

30
00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:51.930
<v Speaker 1>percentage share.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The owners are so sale.</v>

31
00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:53.153
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>also we have some content working on </v>

32
00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:56.220
<v Speaker 1>incontinence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

33
00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:57.053
<v Speaker 1>Tencent video,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is something like the Netflix and </v>

34
00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:02.310
<v Speaker 1>also the tencent music.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's something like spotify and we'll</v>

35
00:02:02.311 --> 00:02:05.210
<v Speaker 1>have the largest a copywriter in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>amount of China for the mill.</v>

36
00:02:05.211 --> 00:02:07.470
<v Speaker 1>That corns and also we have tens and </v>
<v Speaker 1>news.</v>

37
00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:11.610
<v Speaker 1>So it about content.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And also because the Tanzania,</v>

38
00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:14.880
<v Speaker 1>one of the largest internet companies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we have the other,</v>

39
00:02:14.881 --> 00:02:17.030
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the businesses.</v>

40
00:02:17.031 --> 00:02:19.950
<v Speaker 1>That's how as a finance or insurance or </v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that,</v>

41
00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.680
<v Speaker 1>this is all based on internet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

42
00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:23.543
<v Speaker 1>So these are the main structure of </v>
<v Speaker 1>tensen and in the next hour give birth </v>

43
00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:31.470
<v Speaker 1>instruction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But Tessa allies that I were,</v>

44
00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:32.353
<v Speaker 1>I'm now in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it tends to an Arab have actually is </v>

45
00:02:35.311 --> 00:02:38.610
<v Speaker 1>funded in 2016 and we have two </v>
<v Speaker 1>locations.</v>

46
00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:43.640
<v Speaker 1>Why The or China in Shenzhen?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm China and a one office is Seattle.</v>

47
00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:45.120
<v Speaker 1>USA.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

48
00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:49.750
<v Speaker 1>Actually we have four research topics </v>
<v Speaker 1>under the center is the machinery.</v>

49
00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:50.583
<v Speaker 1>It is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've focused on the basic machine </v>

50
00:02:52.621 --> 00:02:53.710
<v Speaker 1>learning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

51
00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:57.420
<v Speaker 1>the machinery series and also large,</v>
<v Speaker 1>large scale machine learning platform.</v>

52
00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:02.080
<v Speaker 1>And as well as the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and based on the machine learning part,</v>

53
00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:05.370
<v Speaker 1>we have three application and research </v>
<v Speaker 1>areas come to vision,</v>

54
00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:07.360
<v Speaker 1>language and speech.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

55
00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:09.970
<v Speaker 1>we would like do something actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>from,</v>

56
00:03:09.971 --> 00:03:10.804
<v Speaker 1>for this that we focus on the areas of </v>
<v Speaker 1>this application and we'd do some or </v>

57
00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:17.710
<v Speaker 1>reinforced learning for the decision and</v>
<v Speaker 1>also general agent for the creation.</v>

58
00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:22.540
<v Speaker 1>And also we would like to maybe make </v>
<v Speaker 1>some combinations for the [inaudible] of</v>

59
00:03:22.541 --> 00:03:25.720
<v Speaker 1>the world of the humans of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

60
00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:27.940
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

61
00:03:27.941 --> 00:03:28.774
<v Speaker 1>in the following,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a falling out this lecture I will </v>

62
00:03:30.611 --> 00:03:31.444
<v Speaker 1>give an introduction about competitor </v>
<v Speaker 1>varies the works that we have done in </v>

63
00:03:34.091 --> 00:03:35.570
<v Speaker 1>computer vision.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

64
00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:36.633
<v Speaker 1>we from the low level image and image </v>
<v Speaker 1>video processing to the middle of the </v>

65
00:03:41.291 --> 00:03:42.124
<v Speaker 1>image we do analysis and the human that </v>
<v Speaker 1>depot was the major and the video </v>

66
00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:46.383
<v Speaker 1>understanding.</v>

67
00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:48.860
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we have done several works here,</v>

68
00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:51.660
<v Speaker 1>subtract or start transfer the husband </v>
<v Speaker 1>and said Lucia.</v>

69
00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:52.553
<v Speaker 1>Under the hazing I would like us to like</v>
<v Speaker 1>some topics that had already this </v>

70
00:03:55.781 --> 00:03:56.614
<v Speaker 1>technology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have already got pop paper publish </v>

71
00:03:58.781 --> 00:04:03.781
<v Speaker 1>and also shifted to the product.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the second is the image analysis.</v>

72
00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:05.523
<v Speaker 1>We focusing will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I will try to introduce some process </v>

73
00:04:07.651 --> 00:04:12.280
<v Speaker 1>automation and as a video interest </v>
<v Speaker 1>attractiveness and the video,</v>

74
00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:14.020
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>classifications.</v>

75
00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:17.200
<v Speaker 1>And also in the last four,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the even harder deeper learning.</v>

76
00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:20.900
<v Speaker 1>In a deeper understanding of the videos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I will give some influx images.</v>

77
00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:24.760
<v Speaker 1>I will give some instruction about </v>
<v Speaker 1>captioning and also the natural language</v>

78
00:04:24.761 --> 00:04:26.410
<v Speaker 1>we do localization.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

79
00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:31.120
<v Speaker 1>First they see the video stock transfer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's say they'll give a brief,</v>

80
00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:33.680
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>image about the video start transfer and</v>

81
00:04:33.681 --> 00:04:34.514
<v Speaker 1>we'll have the videos and we have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>style imagery and we perform the stock </v>

82
00:04:37.301 --> 00:04:37.900
<v Speaker 1>transfer.</v>

83
00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:40.960
<v Speaker 1>We would like the style of videos to </v>
<v Speaker 1>preserve,</v>

84
00:04:40.961 --> 00:04:43.570
<v Speaker 1>to preserve the content of the video </v>
<v Speaker 1>sequences.</v>

85
00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:48.190
<v Speaker 1>And also it will borrow the style </v>
<v Speaker 1>information from the stout stout image.</v>

86
00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:49.353
<v Speaker 1>And the most important is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is very popular in 2016 as a </v>

87
00:04:52.751 --> 00:04:55.210
<v Speaker 1>prisma,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but nowadays for the video,</v>

88
00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:56.193
<v Speaker 1>we have the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we are the first work working on the </v>

89
00:04:57.731 --> 00:04:58.564
<v Speaker 1>videos for the video.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the most important thing to </v>

90
00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:04.270
<v Speaker 1>maintain the temperature consistence </v>
<v Speaker 1>between adjacent offerings.</v>

91
00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:06.130
<v Speaker 1>So from the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

92
00:05:06.131 --> 00:05:06.964
<v Speaker 1>from the sucrose here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the temporal we have compared with the </v>

93
00:05:10.361 --> 00:05:12.520
<v Speaker 1>traditional image style transfer and </v>
<v Speaker 1>though,</v>

94
00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:15.430
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>compared with our proposal mastered,</v>

95
00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:16.473
<v Speaker 1>the image is traditional image start </v>
<v Speaker 1>transfer cannot maintain the </v>

96
00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:22.930
<v Speaker 1>consistencies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the circles and the box stays there.</v>

97
00:05:22.931 --> 00:05:26.800
<v Speaker 1>You can see that as a style changing the</v>
<v Speaker 1>changes a significantly.</v>

98
00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:30.520
<v Speaker 1>But for our video part,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it can maintain a good consistency.</v>

99
00:05:30.521 --> 00:05:34.030
<v Speaker 1>So this will prevent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it will,</v>

100
00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:38.080
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it will eliminate the chattering jet,</v>

101
00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:40.030
<v Speaker 1>the flickering artifacts in the videos.</v>

102
00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:43.203
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this is the Memphis and was a man </v>

103
00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:45.533
<v Speaker 1>network of our video stuff transfer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the first party is a style stylized </v>

104
00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:52.170
<v Speaker 1>and network.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a very traditional and a,</v>

105
00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:53.013
<v Speaker 1>we have a a encoder decoder encoder,</v>
<v Speaker 1>decoder style style and we'll have the </v>

106
00:05:56.621 --> 00:05:58.820
<v Speaker 1>encoders.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We escaped,</v>

107
00:05:58.821 --> 00:06:03.020
<v Speaker 1>we connected with five restaurants,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rest blocks and as the decoders.</v>

108
00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:04.033
<v Speaker 1>And after that we realize the last </v>
<v Speaker 1>networks to computers are stylized </v>

109
00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:12.020
<v Speaker 1>network and a content loss network and </v>
<v Speaker 1>also the uh,</v>

110
00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:12.883
<v Speaker 1>the temperature loss.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So with this loss there's no well </v>

111
00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:16.363
<v Speaker 1>designer we can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can try the networks to makes an </v>

112
00:06:18.791 --> 00:06:20.520
<v Speaker 1>network had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can burn,</v>

113
00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:21.403
<v Speaker 1>can preserve the content and the ad well</v>
<v Speaker 1>as introduced the style and as most </v>

114
00:06:25.851 --> 00:06:26.684
<v Speaker 1>important and can preserve the </v>
<v Speaker 1>consistency between our jason the </v>

115
00:06:28.581 --> 00:06:29.660
<v Speaker 1>frames.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

116
00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:30.643
<v Speaker 1>So for this or special training,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have the two frame coordinator </v>

117
00:06:33.351 --> 00:06:34.184
<v Speaker 1>training.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it means that we input the address </v>

118
00:06:36.591 --> 00:06:37.424
<v Speaker 1>into firms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>into the network and the then utilize </v>

119
00:06:38.961 --> 00:06:42.920
<v Speaker 1>that design as obsessive as it design </v>
<v Speaker 1>the loss function to train the network.</v>

120
00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:44.540
<v Speaker 1>And also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

121
00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:48.560
<v Speaker 1>another,</v>
<v Speaker 1>another advantage is that we do not need</v>

122
00:06:48.561 --> 00:06:50.600
<v Speaker 1>to computer optical flow information on </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

123
00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:53.470
<v Speaker 1>on the fly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it means that we can't,</v>

124
00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:54.313
<v Speaker 1>well we can't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well Mexico we can well Max though </v>

125
00:06:58.720 --> 00:06:59.553
<v Speaker 1>inference very fast because of which do </v>
<v Speaker 1>not need to make a computer that optic </v>

126
00:07:03.441 --> 00:07:04.274
<v Speaker 1>flow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Normally the optical or is our most </v>

127
00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:09.040
<v Speaker 1>complicated part in video parts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

128
00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:11.280
<v Speaker 1>And I see that it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because we are uh,</v>

129
00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:12.233
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] instant message APP is so </v>

130
00:07:17.151 --> 00:07:20.600
<v Speaker 1>the person who will share their food,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their pictures in with the,</v>

131
00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:22.280
<v Speaker 1>with the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with their friends.</v>

132
00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:23.173
<v Speaker 1>So the picture that may be taking and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the different conditions for this case </v>

133
00:07:26.031 --> 00:07:27.890
<v Speaker 1>we want to handle the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

134
00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:33.100
<v Speaker 1>makes the image quality house the house,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but for the low light images.</v>

135
00:07:33.350 --> 00:07:35.660
<v Speaker 1>So we have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you take an image in the low light,</v>

136
00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:36.673
<v Speaker 1>it can now you cannot define it cannot </v>
<v Speaker 1>find the edge of the content and also </v>

137
00:07:40.340 --> 00:07:41.480
<v Speaker 1>the color.</v>

138
00:07:41.490 --> 00:07:43.220
<v Speaker 1>You cannot find the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

139
00:07:43.370 --> 00:07:44.203
<v Speaker 1>you cannot take the right colors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we proposed a method to enhance the </v>

140
00:07:47.991 --> 00:07:48.824
<v Speaker 1>low light images and we have the image </v>
<v Speaker 1>here and with Medicaid displayed to the </v>

141
00:07:52.491 --> 00:07:55.700
<v Speaker 1>original video you made part and also </v>
<v Speaker 1>the age apart.</v>

142
00:07:55.820 --> 00:07:58.640
<v Speaker 1>So because the algae the most selling to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the human perception.</v>

143
00:07:58.760 --> 00:07:59.593
<v Speaker 1>So for the low light in low light to </v>
<v Speaker 1>input our regional part we do could we </v>

144
00:08:03.651 --> 00:08:07.660
<v Speaker 1>use a [inaudible] style to encode the </v>
<v Speaker 1>image and the color image,</v>

145
00:08:07.670 --> 00:08:08.503
<v Speaker 1>a catalog or no results.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And also for the age part we utilize </v>

146
00:08:11.750 --> 00:08:12.583
<v Speaker 1>also something like the encoder decoder </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the afterwards we have the skip the </v>

147
00:08:16.701 --> 00:08:20.150
<v Speaker 1>layer and the ways the island style to </v>
<v Speaker 1>catch the edge information.</v>

148
00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:21.073
<v Speaker 1>Then paste this to the continent </v>
<v Speaker 1>formation and eh as an also the edge </v>

149
00:08:24.991 --> 00:08:27.380
<v Speaker 1>information.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll combine them together then to have</v>

150
00:08:27.620 --> 00:08:28.453
<v Speaker 1>enhanced the quality of the images and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then we got some perceptual losses and </v>

151
00:08:33.051 --> 00:08:37.250
<v Speaker 1>also other adverse or loss is to enhance</v>
<v Speaker 1>the quality of the image.</v>

152
00:08:38.060 --> 00:08:38.893
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is some of the results and we have </v>

153
00:08:40.521 --> 00:08:45.521
<v Speaker 1>the first row is a low light images </v>
<v Speaker 1>provided and we use the our network that</v>

154
00:08:46.340 --> 00:08:47.420
<v Speaker 1>we encounter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can,</v>

155
00:08:47.421 --> 00:08:48.254
<v Speaker 1>well rick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we recover the content of the image and </v>

156
00:08:51.021 --> 00:08:53.420
<v Speaker 1>also the colors that can be well </v>
<v Speaker 1>preserved.</v>

157
00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:54.913
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this is,</v>

158
00:08:55.110 --> 00:08:58.100
<v Speaker 1>this is a one pot of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can share the image,</v>

159
00:08:58.650 --> 00:08:59.483
<v Speaker 1>improve the image quality and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the next is the next work is a mobile </v>

160
00:09:03.991 --> 00:09:04.824
<v Speaker 1>pose estimation actually for the post </v>
<v Speaker 1>has measured helping well to study the </v>

161
00:09:07.871 --> 00:09:08.704
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] had been well studied but </v>
<v Speaker 1>for the mobile part if we need to </v>

162
00:09:12.691 --> 00:09:13.524
<v Speaker 1>perform the network compression and also</v>
<v Speaker 1>Makayta to detect the scattering of </v>

163
00:09:17.670 --> 00:09:18.503
<v Speaker 1>other joints very accurately.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this means this part when mostly </v>

164
00:09:22.590 --> 00:09:25.890
<v Speaker 1>focusing on the network compression and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the networks are proning.</v>

165
00:09:26.220 --> 00:09:27.660
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they,</v>

166
00:09:27.661 --> 00:09:28.494
<v Speaker 1>we shifted the network from the pcs to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the [inaudible] wise and we can perform </v>

167
00:09:32.611 --> 00:09:33.444
<v Speaker 1>the detection of the person that Marty </v>
<v Speaker 1>persons and also for some front end </v>

168
00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:41.610
<v Speaker 1>background and something like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the also instances to the uh,</v>

169
00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:43.410
<v Speaker 1>to the colors of their closest.</v>

170
00:09:43.530 --> 00:09:45.690
<v Speaker 1>And as they see the demos here and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>the first,</v>

171
00:09:46.450 --> 00:09:47.283
<v Speaker 1>the latte.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that this is a maybe for the </v>

172
00:09:49.770 --> 00:09:51.930
<v Speaker 1>projection party.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this is not for real time.</v>

173
00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:53.033
<v Speaker 1>And they see the 22 key points for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>joints of the persons under the under </v>

174
00:09:57.841 --> 00:09:58.674
<v Speaker 1>the left.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why is the way considered to detect the </v>

175
00:10:00.721 --> 00:10:02.520
<v Speaker 1>hand?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because the most of the hand,</v>

176
00:10:02.580 --> 00:10:06.090
<v Speaker 1>the hand is detection will we'll </v>
<v Speaker 1>facilitate our,</v>

177
00:10:06.390 --> 00:10:07.500
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the purchase,</v>

178
00:10:07.501 --> 00:10:09.960
<v Speaker 1>the interaction with the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the phones,</v>

179
00:10:09.990 --> 00:10:11.850
<v Speaker 1>all the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the TVS.</v>

180
00:10:12.330 --> 00:10:16.200
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And also for our mobile post estimation,</v>

181
00:10:16.201 --> 00:10:17.034
<v Speaker 1>we have some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can see that for this one we are </v>

182
00:10:19.051 --> 00:10:23.940
<v Speaker 1>Robinson to the full or half body,</v>
<v Speaker 1>half body,</v>

183
00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.850
<v Speaker 1>half body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That inclusion is on the half bodies.</v>

184
00:10:26.970 --> 00:10:27.803
<v Speaker 1>And also we are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we are able to perform a single or </v>

185
00:10:30.061 --> 00:10:31.950
<v Speaker 1>multiple persons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And also we are,</v>

186
00:10:32.090 --> 00:10:32.923
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we are insensitive to the dressing </v>

187
00:10:34.261 --> 00:10:36.030
<v Speaker 1>colors or the other.</v>

188
00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:39.400
<v Speaker 1>They are the dressings and also we are </v>
<v Speaker 1>robust.</v>

189
00:10:39.401 --> 00:10:40.234
<v Speaker 1>The to the front and back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even from the front and back we had to </v>

190
00:10:42.851 --> 00:10:45.990
<v Speaker 1>tack to the joints under the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>under the,</v>

191
00:10:46.110 --> 00:10:47.560
<v Speaker 1>under the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>under the uh,</v>

192
00:10:47.610 --> 00:10:50.370
<v Speaker 1>information of the scallops.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

193
00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:54.960
<v Speaker 1>also we have already deployed this </v>
<v Speaker 1>techniques into mobile Qq.</v>

194
00:10:55.230 --> 00:10:57.290
<v Speaker 1>And for this one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is uh,</v>

195
00:10:57.340 --> 00:10:58.170
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the left,</v>

196
00:10:58.170 --> 00:11:00.000
<v Speaker 1>the right one is that detector of </v>
<v Speaker 1>matter,</v>

197
00:11:00.001 --> 00:11:02.610
<v Speaker 1>person of the scallions and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>laughter.</v>

198
00:11:02.611 --> 00:11:03.444
<v Speaker 1>Why is that we have the skeletons and we</v>
<v Speaker 1>can have a dancing machine so we can </v>

199
00:11:07.051 --> 00:11:07.884
<v Speaker 1>follow the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

200
00:11:08.130 --> 00:11:10.530
<v Speaker 1>the guidance that underperformed the </v>
<v Speaker 1>dances and the zen,</v>

201
00:11:10.710 --> 00:11:11.543
<v Speaker 1>they say they're very interesting to </v>
<v Speaker 1>interact with the phones or interacted </v>

202
00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:15.360
<v Speaker 1>with the TVS.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

203
00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:18.000
<v Speaker 1>So you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with this one we can find that the,</v>

204
00:11:18.001 --> 00:11:18.834
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the disciplines detection we can </v>

205
00:11:19.861 --> 00:11:24.861
<v Speaker 1>track that can match your positions with</v>
<v Speaker 1>a designed other specified the actions.</v>

206
00:11:25.860 --> 00:11:27.270
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this is,</v>

207
00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:30.180
<v Speaker 1>I work on the post that information.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

208
00:11:31.050 --> 00:11:31.883
<v Speaker 1>And another topic is very interesting </v>
<v Speaker 1>topic either for the video </v>

209
00:11:35.041 --> 00:11:37.140
<v Speaker 1>attractiveness attractiveness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now that,</v>

210
00:11:37.141 --> 00:11:39.630
<v Speaker 1>because for a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have the tencent video,</v>

211
00:11:39.631 --> 00:11:40.464
<v Speaker 1>so we have a lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of video dramas have a lot of </v>

212
00:11:43.580 --> 00:11:44.413
<v Speaker 1>times TV series uploaded on the website.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we want to find whether the users is </v>

213
00:11:49.261 --> 00:11:51.360
<v Speaker 1>interested in to some part of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>videos.</v>

214
00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:52.313
<v Speaker 1>So we would like to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether we can predict the video </v>

215
00:11:55.310 --> 00:11:59.500
<v Speaker 1>attractive from the only the visual </v>
<v Speaker 1>information or the outer inflammations.</v>

216
00:11:59.560 --> 00:12:02.950
<v Speaker 1>So for this one we have the video input </v>
<v Speaker 1>and we,</v>

217
00:12:03.220 --> 00:12:04.053
<v Speaker 1>sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have the video input and also I also </v>

218
00:12:06.281 --> 00:12:07.114
<v Speaker 1>is associated with the auto import and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that we would like to predict it's </v>

219
00:12:10.450 --> 00:12:11.283
<v Speaker 1>attracted us under the crunchiness is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>orange line ended up predict wise is a </v>

220
00:12:16.930 --> 00:12:17.763
<v Speaker 1>predict ones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Either you the Blue Line actually for </v>

221
00:12:19.850 --> 00:12:20.683
<v Speaker 1>this attractive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is very hard to get the ground truth </v>

222
00:12:23.071 --> 00:12:23.710
<v Speaker 1>data.</v>

223
00:12:23.710 --> 00:12:24.543
<v Speaker 1>So we utilize the views because this is </v>
<v Speaker 1>a tencent video have a lot of </v>

224
00:12:27.820 --> 00:12:29.590
<v Speaker 1>registrators.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there are many,</v>

225
00:12:29.591 --> 00:12:30.520
<v Speaker 1>many of you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many,</v>

226
00:12:30.521 --> 00:12:34.480
<v Speaker 1>many viewers at this time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for each of these is this,</v>

227
00:12:34.540 --> 00:12:35.373
<v Speaker 1>each of these values in each points,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it means that at this specific time </v>

228
00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:40.953
<v Speaker 1>harmon person have already have already </v>
<v Speaker 1>watched this video sequence at this </v>

229
00:12:44.201 --> 00:12:46.080
<v Speaker 1>specific time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the,</v>

230
00:12:46.280 --> 00:12:47.113
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the statistically the larger of the </v>

231
00:12:49.991 --> 00:12:52.020
<v Speaker 1>number,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it means that their amendment,</v>

232
00:12:52.380 --> 00:12:53.213
<v Speaker 1>there are a lot of men,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a larger number of person watching this </v>

233
00:12:56.201 --> 00:12:58.300
<v Speaker 1>video at this moment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this prominent,</v>

234
00:12:58.301 --> 00:13:00.990
<v Speaker 1>should it be the machine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

235
00:13:01.090 --> 00:13:03.100
<v Speaker 1>more attractive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>much more attractive,</v>

236
00:13:03.220 --> 00:13:06.190
<v Speaker 1>attractive than they other with similar </v>
<v Speaker 1>values.</v>

237
00:13:06.280 --> 00:13:09.350
<v Speaker 1>So we we utilize this video as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>checklist.</v>

238
00:13:09.570 --> 00:13:10.450
<v Speaker 1>Crunch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>choose value.</v>

239
00:13:10.810 --> 00:13:12.670
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

240
00:13:12.940 --> 00:13:13.773
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for this task we built a large large </v>

241
00:13:16.180 --> 00:13:17.013
<v Speaker 1>large scale data set.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have a one style about west of the </v>

242
00:13:20.621 --> 00:13:24.100
<v Speaker 1>pepsis and the in total about seven to </v>
<v Speaker 1>eight hours.</v>

243
00:13:24.310 --> 00:13:25.143
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are,</v>

244
00:13:25.510 --> 00:13:26.343
<v Speaker 1>we consist of 2,270</v>
<v Speaker 1>episodes of American dramas and also </v>

245
00:13:31.031 --> 00:13:31.864
<v Speaker 1>search.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the two Korean dramas and also seven </v>

246
00:13:34.570 --> 00:13:37.210
<v Speaker 1>episodes of China's drummers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we have this one,</v>

247
00:13:37.211 --> 00:13:38.044
<v Speaker 1>we can see that diverse of a types and </v>
<v Speaker 1>we have also the v the view information </v>

248
00:13:42.921 --> 00:13:43.870
<v Speaker 1>as we can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

249
00:13:43.871 --> 00:13:44.704
<v Speaker 1>start a Mackie to the robusta,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the video or check themselves </v>

250
00:13:48.580 --> 00:13:49.880
<v Speaker 1>studying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the full,</v>

251
00:13:49.890 --> 00:13:54.760
<v Speaker 1>this is a statistical information of our</v>
<v Speaker 1>data set and the,</v>

252
00:13:54.761 --> 00:13:59.620
<v Speaker 1>this is a number of the episodes and </v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a number of the views,</v>

253
00:13:59.820 --> 00:14:03.100
<v Speaker 1>attracting the views and the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the law once in a lot.</v>

254
00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:04.113
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And also besides of the views actually </v>

255
00:14:07.421 --> 00:14:09.340
<v Speaker 1>for it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's the father tencent video,</v>

256
00:14:09.410 --> 00:14:10.243
<v Speaker 1>you are for the v the video platform,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you will have some of the other better </v>

257
00:14:13.331 --> 00:14:16.390
<v Speaker 1>data or some other user engagement tree </v>
<v Speaker 1>formation.</v>

258
00:14:16.450 --> 00:14:21.220
<v Speaker 1>They are the nine catchment information </v>
<v Speaker 1>would crowd is a start of a,</v>

259
00:14:21.221 --> 00:14:25.600
<v Speaker 1>is a stat of the forward and the end of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the forward,</v>

260
00:14:25.750 --> 00:14:29.500
<v Speaker 1>the start of the backward and the start </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the uh,</v>

261
00:14:29.620 --> 00:14:30.453
<v Speaker 1>end of the backward and also have some </v>
<v Speaker 1>pallet screens and doubling the number </v>

262
00:14:34.451 --> 00:14:37.150
<v Speaker 1>of the billing squeeze and as the likes </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the polling screens.</v>

263
00:14:37.330 --> 00:14:39.820
<v Speaker 1>And also we have the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

264
00:14:40.270 --> 00:14:42.910
<v Speaker 1>the forward skips and a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first,</v>

265
00:14:42.911 --> 00:14:45.730
<v Speaker 1>the word faster.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We were real wind skips.</v>

266
00:14:45.850 --> 00:14:46.683
<v Speaker 1>So with this ones we can get another </v>
<v Speaker 1>more information about the user </v>

267
00:14:49.901 --> 00:14:53.750
<v Speaker 1>engagements with a video with as this </v>
<v Speaker 1>user in catchments of videos,</v>

268
00:14:53.900 --> 00:14:56.420
<v Speaker 1>you can can have more info,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more detailed information about,</v>

269
00:14:56.780 --> 00:15:01.780
<v Speaker 1>they do our checklist and we can pass on</v>
<v Speaker 1>these engagements to analysis more.</v>

270
00:15:02.280 --> 00:15:05.120
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alana's more about the human behaviors.</v>

271
00:15:06.860 --> 00:15:07.910
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

272
00:15:07.970 --> 00:15:11.240
<v Speaker 1>as we mentioned before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we would like to make a prediction about</v>

273
00:15:11.241 --> 00:15:13.580
<v Speaker 1>the attracted from the audio and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>video,</v>

274
00:15:13.680 --> 00:15:15.590
<v Speaker 1>all the information and the visual </v>
<v Speaker 1>information.</v>

275
00:15:15.710 --> 00:15:18.400
<v Speaker 1>So for this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two different modalities because we have</v>

276
00:15:18.401 --> 00:15:21.720
<v Speaker 1>a audio part and the other visual part,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we four,</v>

277
00:15:21.740 --> 00:15:25.670
<v Speaker 1>we proposed three different theorists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Strategy.</v>

278
00:15:25.700 --> 00:15:29.120
<v Speaker 1>Why is in the low level and a y in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>middle of error and the wine in the high</v>

279
00:15:29.121 --> 00:15:29.660
<v Speaker 1>level.</v>

280
00:15:29.660 --> 00:15:32.360
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they see that three star.</v>

281
00:15:32.450 --> 00:15:35.690
<v Speaker 1>This is the structure of the film part.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

282
00:15:35.780 --> 00:15:38.660
<v Speaker 1>we have also each part we propose,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we utilize,</v>

283
00:15:38.690 --> 00:15:42.290
<v Speaker 1>we perform our contact skating here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

284
00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:45.660
<v Speaker 1>So based on this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this architecture that we perform,</v>

285
00:15:45.661 --> 00:15:47.720
<v Speaker 1>that prediction and we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have the,</v>

286
00:15:47.750 --> 00:15:48.583
<v Speaker 1>we also propose us three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the three criteria to evaluate whether </v>

287
00:15:52.671 --> 00:15:56.810
<v Speaker 1>we can actually the pro,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can actually perform the Eh,</v>

288
00:15:57.130 --> 00:15:59.510
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>accurate prediction.</v>

289
00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:00.433
<v Speaker 1>So we have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have the four metrics and a then </v>

290
00:16:03.201 --> 00:16:04.034
<v Speaker 1>we'll compare to with different visual </v>
<v Speaker 1>representation from vg to inception to </v>

291
00:16:08.871 --> 00:16:09.351
<v Speaker 1>rest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rest,</v>

292
00:16:09.351 --> 00:16:10.184
<v Speaker 1>not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And therefore the other part would </v>

293
00:16:10.850 --> 00:16:15.230
<v Speaker 1>compare with MFCC and an and also the </v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] part.</v>

294
00:16:15.440 --> 00:16:19.940
<v Speaker 1>So we can say that you consider all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>auto feature,</v>

295
00:16:19.941 --> 00:16:24.020
<v Speaker 1>that innovative feature together we can </v>
<v Speaker 1>get better results and better results.</v>

296
00:16:24.290 --> 00:16:25.123
<v Speaker 1>But if we can sample the middle level,</v>
<v Speaker 1>high level and a love of fueling </v>

297
00:16:29.190 --> 00:16:31.160
<v Speaker 1>strategy together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can get to the best of performance.</v>

298
00:16:31.680 --> 00:16:36.290
<v Speaker 1>So understanding that run and nothing </v>
<v Speaker 1>and nothing to note that is,</v>

299
00:16:36.291 --> 00:16:38.150
<v Speaker 1>I will have the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we have the engagements,</v>

300
00:16:38.400 --> 00:16:40.790
<v Speaker 1>the is that is the behavior of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>users.</v>

301
00:16:40.940 --> 00:16:41.773
<v Speaker 1>So we can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we can get an engagement so we can </v>

302
00:16:43.611 --> 00:16:48.330
<v Speaker 1>make a very accurate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very accurate prediction on the video of</v>

303
00:16:48.360 --> 00:16:52.250
<v Speaker 1>checkmates because if they like it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it will watch it and otherwise they will</v>

304
00:16:52.410 --> 00:16:53.243
<v Speaker 1>leave this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>leave this videos so that the human </v>

305
00:16:56.490 --> 00:16:59.540
<v Speaker 1>engagements you the most important part </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the indicator,</v>

306
00:16:59.780 --> 00:17:03.410
<v Speaker 1>the indicator of the video checklist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

307
00:17:03.530 --> 00:17:05.960
<v Speaker 1>So these are for the video </v>
<v Speaker 1>attractiveness starting.</v>

308
00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:07.033
<v Speaker 1>And also we started,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we make some study around the video </v>

309
00:17:09.621 --> 00:17:10.454
<v Speaker 1>classification and as a mentioned there </v>
<v Speaker 1>before them and mentioned them by Lisa </v>

310
00:17:13.371 --> 00:17:15.830
<v Speaker 1>before the moment at the moment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>same time,</v>

311
00:17:15.890 --> 00:17:19.700
<v Speaker 1>the three seconds of the video that also</v>
<v Speaker 1>about Vedo complications,</v>

312
00:17:19.730 --> 00:17:23.150
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then a nother before that,</v>

313
00:17:23.320 --> 00:17:25.200
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

314
00:17:25.290 --> 00:17:29.630
<v Speaker 1>there's a benchmark tests that aren't </v>
<v Speaker 1>the ucf one zero one.</v>

315
00:17:29.780 --> 00:17:32.670
<v Speaker 1>So we perform for this part,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we perform the two streams,</v>

316
00:17:32.740 --> 00:17:36.110
<v Speaker 1>we utilize that to stream [inaudible] on</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

317
00:17:36.410 --> 00:17:39.160
<v Speaker 1>on the video classification and the one </v>
<v Speaker 1>stream is,</v>

318
00:17:39.640 --> 00:17:40.970
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>describe the content.</v>

319
00:17:40.971 --> 00:17:41.804
<v Speaker 1>And once from it is crap.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The optical information optical flow </v>

320
00:17:43.970 --> 00:17:44.803
<v Speaker 1>meet means that an emotion information </v>
<v Speaker 1>between adjusting the frames and we </v>

321
00:17:47.871 --> 00:17:48.704
<v Speaker 1>proposed a principal back propagation </v>
<v Speaker 1>propagation that we forward all the </v>

322
00:17:52.501 --> 00:17:53.334
<v Speaker 1>snippers so the forwarding Romanian can </v>
<v Speaker 1>capture all the information of the </v>

323
00:17:56.131 --> 00:18:01.131
<v Speaker 1>videos and but for the backward we will </v>
<v Speaker 1>perform a selectively to backward only a</v>

324
00:18:01.470 --> 00:18:06.210
<v Speaker 1>selected number of snippers netplus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So one info wine,</v>

325
00:18:06.260 --> 00:18:07.093
<v Speaker 1>a wine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one benefit is that from this efficient </v>

326
00:18:10.570 --> 00:18:14.460
<v Speaker 1>backpropagation we can't get no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can perform a efficient and training.</v>

327
00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:15.473
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>another benefit is that we can also </v>

328
00:18:17.971 --> 00:18:18.804
<v Speaker 1>perform that it's named Paris in </v>
<v Speaker 1>different scales to characterize the </v>

329
00:18:22.291 --> 00:18:24.570
<v Speaker 1>emotion that different emotion formation</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the videos.</v>

330
00:18:25.770 --> 00:18:27.320
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is our,</v>

331
00:18:27.350 --> 00:18:29.490
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>results and for this,</v>

332
00:18:29.491 --> 00:18:30.324
<v Speaker 1>that sets the pippin that here and how </v>
<v Speaker 1>even now to achieve the type one error </v>

333
00:18:35.101 --> 00:18:39.150
<v Speaker 1>rate in about only 8.6</v>
<v Speaker 1>the percentage.</v>

334
00:18:39.210 --> 00:18:40.043
<v Speaker 1>So this is a slow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is smaller than the other </v>

335
00:18:41.880 --> 00:18:43.960
<v Speaker 1>competitive models.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

336
00:18:44.640 --> 00:18:47.030
<v Speaker 1>Also for the beetle classifications,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we we po,</v>

337
00:18:47.090 --> 00:18:49.020
<v Speaker 1>Po,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're participating in the youtube,</v>

338
00:18:49.350 --> 00:18:50.183
<v Speaker 1>Youtube eight main and challenge the </v>
<v Speaker 1>here and now for the Youtube 8 million </v>

339
00:18:53.071 --> 00:18:53.904
<v Speaker 1>challenges here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They only provided the weight of the </v>

340
00:18:55.861 --> 00:18:59.250
<v Speaker 1>features for the visual features and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it'll auto features.</v>

341
00:18:59.430 --> 00:19:00.263
<v Speaker 1>So we work on the audio and the video </v>
<v Speaker 1>feature to perform the video </v>

342
00:19:03.031 --> 00:19:03.864
<v Speaker 1>classification.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And a we for this is that we perform a </v>

343
00:19:07.090 --> 00:19:10.410
<v Speaker 1>tooth two level consultation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why in the end the video liable.</v>

344
00:19:10.440 --> 00:19:11.273
<v Speaker 1>So the Beta level where average is uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the all the frames together to get a </v>

345
00:19:14.391 --> 00:19:17.220
<v Speaker 1>little bit of of the representation and </v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

346
00:19:17.430 --> 00:19:18.263
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we propose the amount of fuel in layer </v>

347
00:19:19.651 --> 00:19:23.400
<v Speaker 1>here as a deputy here and as empathy </v>
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>

348
00:19:23.520 --> 00:19:24.353
<v Speaker 1>for the customer fires,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we tried to mix mixture of experts and </v>

349
00:19:27.511 --> 00:19:27.690
<v Speaker 1>luck.</v>

350
00:19:27.690 --> 00:19:32.690
<v Speaker 1>Global accuracy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Precision is Arbutus only 0.82.</v>

351
00:19:33.660 --> 00:19:34.493
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And also we performed the friend level </v>

352
00:19:36.991 --> 00:19:37.824
<v Speaker 1>classification.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now from a level of transparency </v>

353
00:19:39.361 --> 00:19:40.194
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] it very intuitively to have </v>
<v Speaker 1>the LSTM and all that Gio to model the </v>

354
00:19:45.270 --> 00:19:47.340
<v Speaker 1>sequential data.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for the video,</v>

355
00:19:47.370 --> 00:19:48.203
<v Speaker 1>the video feature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is the can be viewed as a </v>

356
00:19:49.921 --> 00:19:51.390
<v Speaker 1>sequential data.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Say We,</v>

357
00:19:51.391 --> 00:19:52.224
<v Speaker 1>so we utilize the about directional lstm</v>
<v Speaker 1>and [inaudible] and the GRU and also we </v>

358
00:19:56.491 --> 00:19:57.660
<v Speaker 1>consider different,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

359
00:19:57.690 --> 00:20:01.050
<v Speaker 1>different emotions information.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we perform our motto scale wise.</v>

360
00:20:01.170 --> 00:20:06.170
<v Speaker 1>So for each scale we perform,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we perform a bad direction,</v>

361
00:20:06.660 --> 00:20:08.510
<v Speaker 1>but direction of Gru,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

362
00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:12.060
<v Speaker 1>our lstm and the JP here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the global,</v>

363
00:20:12.300 --> 00:20:17.300
<v Speaker 1>the global average precision is </v>
<v Speaker 1>thereupon 0.83</v>

364
00:20:18.390 --> 00:20:19.223
<v Speaker 1>and a if we consider the video level </v>
<v Speaker 1>part and as a frame labral part </v>

365
00:20:21.991 --> 00:20:23.460
<v Speaker 1>together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can get as a,</v>

366
00:20:23.461 --> 00:20:26.730
<v Speaker 1>jp is the 0.84.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

367
00:20:26.760 --> 00:20:29.690
<v Speaker 1>we achieved about to the force positions</v>
<v Speaker 1>number four,</v>

368
00:20:29.710 --> 00:20:33.720
<v Speaker 1>the first productions over the 606 400 </v>
<v Speaker 1>submissions.</v>

369
00:20:34.920 --> 00:20:37.870
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this is about the video and image and</v>

370
00:20:37.871 --> 00:20:39.540
<v Speaker 1>the data analysis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

371
00:20:39.930 --> 00:20:42.690
<v Speaker 1>Afterwards I will ensure that I will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

372
00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:43.553
<v Speaker 1>afterwards I will give a instruction </v>
<v Speaker 1>about some workers who would have done </v>

373
00:20:46.930 --> 00:20:47.763
<v Speaker 1>on the learn on the understanding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One part is the image or understanding </v>

374
00:20:51.431 --> 00:20:56.040
<v Speaker 1>here and the image I understanding this </v>
<v Speaker 1>is a very difficult part because we a an</v>

375
00:20:56.120 --> 00:20:56.953
<v Speaker 1>image to understand the image caption </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the image is a very difficult part </v>

376
00:21:00.131 --> 00:21:02.680
<v Speaker 1>because we're not only to understand the</v>
<v Speaker 1>image content,</v>

377
00:21:02.890 --> 00:21:07.890
<v Speaker 1>but also we need to learn the language </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the properties or the behavior of the</v>

378
00:21:07.901 --> 00:21:08.734
<v Speaker 1>language of compositions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And also we need to perform a Amati </v>

379
00:21:11.890 --> 00:21:16.060
<v Speaker 1>Motel interactions between the image and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sentences.</v>

380
00:21:16.540 --> 00:21:18.940
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for this one here,</v>

381
00:21:18.941 --> 00:21:19.774
<v Speaker 1>we also utilize our traditional,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like the traditional </v>

382
00:21:23.980 --> 00:21:24.813
<v Speaker 1>architecture for the image.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We utilize that image you see in to </v>

383
00:21:27.480 --> 00:21:28.870
<v Speaker 1>encode the information.</v>

384
00:21:29.020 --> 00:21:33.670
<v Speaker 1>And the week Max we get the image </v>
<v Speaker 1>representation in the global wise and in</v>

385
00:21:33.671 --> 00:21:36.430
<v Speaker 1>the local wise for the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we have a saying here,</v>

386
00:21:36.520 --> 00:21:39.550
<v Speaker 1>if half a million,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you are familiar with sailing for the</v>

387
00:21:39.551 --> 00:21:40.110
<v Speaker 1>last,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

388
00:21:40.110 --> 00:21:42.340
<v Speaker 1>at the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fully connected layer,</v>

389
00:21:42.370 --> 00:21:46.660
<v Speaker 1>this is a global representation and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>for the intermediate convolution layers,</v>

390
00:21:46.690 --> 00:21:49.060
<v Speaker 1>this is a global,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they see the local representations.</v>

391
00:21:49.240 --> 00:21:52.600
<v Speaker 1>So for each image,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a image,</v>

392
00:21:52.601 --> 00:21:53.950
<v Speaker 1>a thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can get the,</v>

393
00:21:53.980 --> 00:21:57.700
<v Speaker 1>we can get to the image global and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>local representations.</v>

394
00:21:57.910 --> 00:22:00.630
<v Speaker 1>And with this [inaudible] if we have </v>
<v Speaker 1>different uh,</v>

395
00:22:00.850 --> 00:22:01.683
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the such as the inception and the rest </v>

396
00:22:03.991 --> 00:22:04.824
<v Speaker 1>net or the egg,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have different things that we will </v>

397
00:22:08.831 --> 00:22:13.000
<v Speaker 1>have multiple,</v>
<v Speaker 1>multiple representation of the image for</v>

398
00:22:13.001 --> 00:22:13.834
<v Speaker 1>each year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For each set we have a global </v>

399
00:22:15.731 --> 00:22:18.010
<v Speaker 1>representation and a local </v>
<v Speaker 1>representation.</v>

400
00:22:18.280 --> 00:22:23.280
<v Speaker 1>And with this different representations </v>
<v Speaker 1>we can perform a marty stage attention.</v>

401
00:22:24.100 --> 00:22:25.950
<v Speaker 1>And the Marty come,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

402
00:22:26.130 --> 00:22:26.963
<v Speaker 1>Maddie's stage attention can first to </v>
<v Speaker 1>summarize the information from </v>

403
00:22:30.010 --> 00:22:33.270
<v Speaker 1>definitely encoders such as the rest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not in separate ways.</v>

404
00:22:33.710 --> 00:22:38.140
<v Speaker 1>You separately before and also the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the vgg.</v>

405
00:22:38.170 --> 00:22:40.630
<v Speaker 1>So we can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can sample this,</v>

406
00:22:40.930 --> 00:22:45.850
<v Speaker 1>the present them together and also Max </v>
<v Speaker 1>this representative and to interact with</v>

407
00:22:45.851 --> 00:22:50.770
<v Speaker 1>each other and for the attention part so</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can broadcast to their,</v>

408
00:22:51.170 --> 00:22:53.440
<v Speaker 1>their information to the other encoder </v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

409
00:22:53.800 --> 00:22:56.840
<v Speaker 1>to let the other encoder know whether </v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

410
00:22:56.841 --> 00:23:00.610
<v Speaker 1>what information has been already </v>
<v Speaker 1>considered the for the generation part.</v>

411
00:23:01.210 --> 00:23:04.900
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we had afterwards with a will perform</v>

412
00:23:04.901 --> 00:23:07.390
<v Speaker 1>the multi stage attention,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then we'll utilize that.</v>

413
00:23:07.391 --> 00:23:10.360
<v Speaker 1>Another decoder,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you did another uh,</v>

414
00:23:10.361 --> 00:23:14.020
<v Speaker 1>another decoder to decode these </v>
<v Speaker 1>representations.</v>

415
00:23:14.110 --> 00:23:16.330
<v Speaker 1>Two sentences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The decoder.</v>

416
00:23:16.390 --> 00:23:21.390
<v Speaker 1>Normally we can utilize our R and R and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

417
00:23:21.910 --> 00:23:24.940
<v Speaker 1>the Alstom and Gio is the most effective</v>
<v Speaker 1>arlene's.</v>

418
00:23:24.960 --> 00:23:26.260
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

419
00:23:26.261 --> 00:23:30.100
<v Speaker 1>we have in here we utilize that Lstm so </v>
<v Speaker 1>we have definitely,</v>

420
00:23:30.101 --> 00:23:32.680
<v Speaker 1>we have the image,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can call the catheter representation</v>

421
00:23:32.740 --> 00:23:36.670
<v Speaker 1>and then we have the Dakota to Dakota </v>
<v Speaker 1>representation into a sentence.</v>

422
00:23:37.630 --> 00:23:39.710
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this is first,</v>

423
00:23:39.750 --> 00:23:41.310
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this pay first.</v>

424
00:23:41.370 --> 00:23:42.203
<v Speaker 1>This is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this task is you need to consider the </v>

425
00:23:45.381 --> 00:23:50.381
<v Speaker 1>information of the continent and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>you made in the image and also integrate</v>

426
00:23:50.510 --> 00:23:54.080
<v Speaker 1>with the sentences to make the two folks</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the,</v>

427
00:23:54.110 --> 00:23:59.090
<v Speaker 1>each object to is a generation of each </v>
<v Speaker 1>words such as for the persons.</v>

428
00:23:59.210 --> 00:24:01.520
<v Speaker 1>You need to pay attention to the object </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the,</v>

429
00:24:01.730 --> 00:24:04.340
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the person needs to pay attention to the</v>

430
00:24:04.341 --> 00:24:05.720
<v Speaker 1>local region,</v>
<v Speaker 1>other the persons,</v>

431
00:24:05.870 --> 00:24:07.720
<v Speaker 1>and then generate the words and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>father,</v>

432
00:24:07.730 --> 00:24:08.563
<v Speaker 1>the hills.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You need to pay attention to the local </v>

433
00:24:09.891 --> 00:24:13.550
<v Speaker 1>region of the image and then generates </v>
<v Speaker 1>the words here.</v>

434
00:24:14.150 --> 00:24:16.280
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for these things,</v>

435
00:24:17.390 --> 00:24:20.900
<v Speaker 1>we propel based on our multi stage </v>
<v Speaker 1>attention.</v>

436
00:24:21.140 --> 00:24:22.350
<v Speaker 1>We have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

437
00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:23.540
<v Speaker 1>perform,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

438
00:24:23.600 --> 00:24:26.110
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have some Meta hour that's under Mac,</v>

439
00:24:26.150 --> 00:24:26.983
<v Speaker 1>Microsoft,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the cocoa challenge here they say the </v>

440
00:24:28.851 --> 00:24:31.070
<v Speaker 1>most,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that is the most,</v>

441
00:24:31.080 --> 00:24:31.913
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most influence board influence that fat </v>

442
00:24:35.210 --> 00:24:36.290
<v Speaker 1>on the image captioning.</v>

443
00:24:36.410 --> 00:24:38.960
<v Speaker 1>For each image it will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

444
00:24:38.990 --> 00:24:43.400
<v Speaker 1>each image is a company with five </v>
<v Speaker 1>sentences under there about uh,</v>

445
00:24:43.790 --> 00:24:46.540
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about 100,000</v>

446
00:24:46.850 --> 00:24:51.850
<v Speaker 1>images and therefore h majors as it is </v>
<v Speaker 1>accompanied with five sentences.</v>

447
00:24:52.190 --> 00:24:55.640
<v Speaker 1>So I think the appeared the pair Datas </v>
<v Speaker 1>for image.</v>

448
00:24:55.700 --> 00:25:00.700
<v Speaker 1>Understand the pay data.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is about 600 southern pairs.</v>

449
00:25:01.160 --> 00:25:02.570
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Based on this data,</v>

450
00:25:02.750 --> 00:25:05.930
<v Speaker 1>you can perform the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can perform,</v>

451
00:25:05.970 --> 00:25:08.830
<v Speaker 1>you can perform,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can promote a training of the the of</v>

452
00:25:08.870 --> 00:25:09.703
<v Speaker 1>your model and that's the image that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>results of the test data on the website </v>

453
00:25:13.910 --> 00:25:14.743
<v Speaker 1>and a for this website we have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have several criteria to evaluate </v>

454
00:25:18.481 --> 00:25:21.480
<v Speaker 1>your results and for the reason I say </v>
<v Speaker 1>that for this,</v>

455
00:25:21.481 --> 00:25:26.481
<v Speaker 1>see the blue and the blue blue one blue </v>
<v Speaker 1>two plus three blue for and also we have</v>

456
00:25:26.571 --> 00:25:27.404
<v Speaker 1>the meter Raj and cider say cid or this </v>
<v Speaker 1>is for the crd or this is the most </v>

457
00:25:32.911 --> 00:25:33.744
<v Speaker 1>suspicious specifically designed for </v>
<v Speaker 1>evaluating the quality of the image </v>

458
00:25:37.071 --> 00:25:37.904
<v Speaker 1>captioning.</v>

459
00:25:37.970 --> 00:25:38.803
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So far this fall for this we can say </v>

460
00:25:43.671 --> 00:25:48.310
<v Speaker 1>that for the CFI and the c 40 we can </v>
<v Speaker 1>achieve all four.</v>

461
00:25:48.311 --> 00:25:53.240
<v Speaker 1>All the metrics we achieve the top one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>top wide results and the compared to the</v>

462
00:25:53.241 --> 00:25:56.540
<v Speaker 1>other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are there other models here?</v>

463
00:25:57.200 --> 00:25:59.870
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Also we also,</v>

464
00:25:59.871 --> 00:26:01.570
<v Speaker 1>we have transformed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have,</v>

465
00:26:01.580 --> 00:26:03.720
<v Speaker 1>we have a collector,</v>
<v Speaker 1>another Chinese dataset.</v>

466
00:26:03.770 --> 00:26:04.603
<v Speaker 1>We have an image here and also we have </v>
<v Speaker 1>the image and that is a company that a </v>

467
00:26:08.811 --> 00:26:13.210
<v Speaker 1>Chinese sentences and a we're trying to </v>
<v Speaker 1>models and also with deployed the,</v>

468
00:26:13.280 --> 00:26:16.790
<v Speaker 1>we have released the results and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

469
00:26:17.450 --> 00:26:18.470
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

470
00:26:18.680 --> 00:26:19.513
<v Speaker 1>we build a late later program in we chat</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you can experience it if you have </v>

471
00:26:25.731 --> 00:26:26.810
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which had here.</v>

472
00:26:27.620 --> 00:26:28.453
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the Chinese for intelligent </v>

473
00:26:30.110 --> 00:26:31.640
<v Speaker 1>image recognition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

474
00:26:31.850 --> 00:26:36.080
<v Speaker 1>So for this image it had for the Chinese</v>
<v Speaker 1>give a brief brief instruction.</v>

475
00:26:36.140 --> 00:26:36.973
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very good disclosure about the content </v>

476
00:26:39.531 --> 00:26:40.430
<v Speaker 1>of the image.</v>

477
00:26:40.910 --> 00:26:41.810
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the,</v>

478
00:26:41.811 --> 00:26:42.644
<v Speaker 1>for this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we have the image of captioning the </v>

479
00:26:43.981 --> 00:26:44.814
<v Speaker 1>results,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll give a image and I gave her a </v>

480
00:26:46.591 --> 00:26:48.810
<v Speaker 1>sentence or two describe the content of </v>
<v Speaker 1>danger.</v>

481
00:26:49.020 --> 00:26:51.690
<v Speaker 1>We can perform first.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The most Australian boy,</v>

482
00:26:51.720 --> 00:26:55.890
<v Speaker 1>eataly is a performer he made discursion</v>
<v Speaker 1>and other is that we have this sentences</v>

483
00:26:55.891 --> 00:26:56.724
<v Speaker 1>that were going to perform the image </v>
<v Speaker 1>retrieval and the also as well as the </v>

484
00:26:59.251 --> 00:27:03.090
<v Speaker 1>magic recommendations and also for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>visual dialogues.</v>

485
00:27:03.360 --> 00:27:04.810
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the most important.</v>

486
00:27:04.811 --> 00:27:05.644
<v Speaker 1>I say if we have the image under the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the discussions that we can help the </v>

487
00:27:08.221 --> 00:27:09.054
<v Speaker 1>visually impairment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Imparity he made a person to read or to </v>

488
00:27:13.861 --> 00:27:16.260
<v Speaker 1>see the images.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

489
00:27:17.130 --> 00:27:19.800
<v Speaker 1>So this is the work I imagine captioning</v>
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

490
00:27:19.950 --> 00:27:21.330
<v Speaker 1>afterwards,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

491
00:27:21.331 --> 00:27:25.530
<v Speaker 1>the last work that I'm going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>introduce is a natural language of video</v>

492
00:27:25.560 --> 00:27:26.393
<v Speaker 1>localization.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They see the also are very challenging </v>

493
00:27:28.740 --> 00:27:33.270
<v Speaker 1>challenge a task one to you utilize a </v>
<v Speaker 1>language we give.</v>

494
00:27:33.410 --> 00:27:34.430
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>will you try,</v>

495
00:27:34.440 --> 00:27:37.230
<v Speaker 1>are we giving our team the video and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

496
00:27:37.231 --> 00:27:39.540
<v Speaker 1>natural language or discretion?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The girl,</v>

497
00:27:39.610 --> 00:27:40.443
<v Speaker 1>we would like to localize a stigma too </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the video which a correspondent to </v>

498
00:27:43.921 --> 00:27:47.850
<v Speaker 1>the given natural languages Christian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it means that if you will,</v>

499
00:27:47.880 --> 00:27:51.030
<v Speaker 1>if we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sorry if we have a very long,</v>

500
00:27:51.031 --> 00:27:51.864
<v Speaker 1>they do say process and a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have a sentence that described such </v>

501
00:27:55.201 --> 00:27:58.470
<v Speaker 1>as a woman rails,</v>
<v Speaker 1>keep a kite back,</v>

502
00:27:58.471 --> 00:27:59.304
<v Speaker 1>lean forward herself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We would like to localize this sentence </v>

503
00:28:02.940 --> 00:28:06.750
<v Speaker 1>in the videos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this is a virtue as same as the image</v>

504
00:28:06.751 --> 00:28:07.584
<v Speaker 1>captioning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is a very challenge because first we </v>

505
00:28:10.621 --> 00:28:11.454
<v Speaker 1>need to understand the language and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>next that we need to understand the </v>

506
00:28:16.051 --> 00:28:16.860
<v Speaker 1>video.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Same question,</v>

507
00:28:16.860 --> 00:28:17.693
<v Speaker 1>but for the video sequence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the understanding is the human </v>

508
00:28:19.030 --> 00:28:21.210
<v Speaker 1>challenges that you majors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because the temperature,</v>

509
00:28:21.300 --> 00:28:24.240
<v Speaker 1>we need to not only consider the image </v>
<v Speaker 1>con the,</v>

510
00:28:24.241 --> 00:28:25.074
<v Speaker 1>the special content of the image,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also we need to consider the </v>

511
00:28:28.020 --> 00:28:30.950
<v Speaker 1>temporal relationship between the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

512
00:28:31.180 --> 00:28:32.160
<v Speaker 1>adjusting the frames.</v>

513
00:28:32.280 --> 00:28:35.040
<v Speaker 1>So we perform,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we propose to us single story,</v>

514
00:28:35.100 --> 00:28:35.933
<v Speaker 1>a single stream and natural language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't look as a Australian network </v>

515
00:28:39.420 --> 00:28:40.980
<v Speaker 1>for this part.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have the we,</v>

516
00:28:41.070 --> 00:28:41.903
<v Speaker 1>sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

517
00:28:41.970 --> 00:28:42.803
<v Speaker 1>we have the videos and I will have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>sentence in the world perform frame by </v>

518
00:28:46.501 --> 00:28:47.334
<v Speaker 1>word interactions or mentions here all </v>
<v Speaker 1>mentioned Syria matching pro matching </v>

519
00:28:52.650 --> 00:28:56.610
<v Speaker 1>performance matching between the </v>
<v Speaker 1>sentence under the video.</v>

520
00:28:56.760 --> 00:28:58.180
<v Speaker 1>Then we have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

521
00:28:58.310 --> 00:28:59.120
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>

522
00:28:59.120 --> 00:29:04.120
<v Speaker 1>with this matching behaviors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we perform a temporal proposals and have</v>

523
00:29:05.130 --> 00:29:05.963
<v Speaker 1>different anchors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then we'll have definitely scores with </v>

524
00:29:07.891 --> 00:29:08.724
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the single stream processes we can </v>

525
00:29:10.680 --> 00:29:14.880
<v Speaker 1>efficient and I localize the sentences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a video sequences.</v>

526
00:29:15.630 --> 00:29:18.780
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And as this is some results of our,</v>

527
00:29:18.900 --> 00:29:23.850
<v Speaker 1>this is someone who does of our proposed</v>
<v Speaker 1>a masters and they see the videos and as</v>

528
00:29:23.860 --> 00:29:24.900
<v Speaker 1>they say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have a sentence,</v>

529
00:29:25.110 --> 00:29:28.180
<v Speaker 1>a man in a red shirt caps his hand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

530
00:29:28.190 --> 00:29:29.023
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

531
00:29:29.300 --> 00:29:30.510
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

532
00:29:30.511 --> 00:29:34.250
<v Speaker 1>the gray ones is our ground shoes and a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the green greenland is,</v>

533
00:29:34.260 --> 00:29:39.260
<v Speaker 1>we utilize a vgg 16 as the image as an </v>
<v Speaker 1>encoder.</v>

534
00:29:39.720 --> 00:29:44.720
<v Speaker 1>And a for the blue ones is we utilize </v>
<v Speaker 1>the inception before as an encoder.</v>

535
00:29:46.060 --> 00:29:46.870
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

536
00:29:46.870 --> 00:29:50.410
<v Speaker 1>the yellow was when you guys assist </v>
<v Speaker 1>really as the encoder.</v>

537
00:29:50.560 --> 00:29:54.180
<v Speaker 1>So you can see that if we utilize a vgg </v>
<v Speaker 1>16 and,</v>

538
00:29:54.181 --> 00:29:55.490
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

539
00:29:55.491 --> 00:29:56.324
<v Speaker 1>inception before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can get a reasonable accurate or is </v>

540
00:29:59.951 --> 00:30:01.270
<v Speaker 1>out at your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for this,</v>

541
00:30:01.900 --> 00:30:03.100
<v Speaker 1>for this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>specify the task.</v>

542
00:30:03.120 --> 00:30:06.490
<v Speaker 1>We're up from all the competitor models </v>
<v Speaker 1>on this,</v>

543
00:30:06.491 --> 00:30:08.260
<v Speaker 1>especially the task.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And therefore this,</v>

544
00:30:08.261 --> 00:30:09.490
<v Speaker 1>that sat the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for this,</v>

545
00:30:09.730 --> 00:30:10.563
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the camera was zoom out to show where </v>

546
00:30:13.091 --> 00:30:15.610
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what four is coming front so they can,</v>

547
00:30:15.640 --> 00:30:17.670
<v Speaker 1>you can see that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

548
00:30:17.710 --> 00:30:19.240
<v Speaker 1>the for the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the,</v>

549
00:30:19.290 --> 00:30:20.123
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the furion with during in the </v>

550
00:30:21.131 --> 00:30:26.131
<v Speaker 1>inception before and optic flow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can get to the accurate prediction on</v>

551
00:30:26.591 --> 00:30:28.630
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on this example.</v>

552
00:30:29.230 --> 00:30:30.040
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wait,</v>

553
00:30:30.040 --> 00:30:30.760
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>another,</v>

554
00:30:30.760 --> 00:30:32.530
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>besides we examine,</v>

555
00:30:32.590 --> 00:30:37.590
<v Speaker 1>we examine the frame and the frame by </v>
<v Speaker 1>word attentions here and the,</v>

556
00:30:38.111 --> 00:30:40.060
<v Speaker 1>for this sentence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what for,</v>

557
00:30:40.090 --> 00:30:43.600
<v Speaker 1>for this sentence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for this center and worked for in forest</v>

558
00:30:43.870 --> 00:30:47.230
<v Speaker 1>for they say you can see that for this </v>
<v Speaker 1>all video sequences in the forest,</v>

559
00:30:47.620 --> 00:30:50.710
<v Speaker 1>the first day is appeared over all </v>
<v Speaker 1>frames.</v>

560
00:30:50.740 --> 00:30:55.740
<v Speaker 1>So the attach matters will be attended,</v>
<v Speaker 1>will be triggered at equally.</v>

561
00:30:56.230 --> 00:31:00.070
<v Speaker 1>But for this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for this workforce only appearing in the</v>

562
00:31:00.071 --> 00:31:04.390
<v Speaker 1>forest first of frame so it won't have </v>
<v Speaker 1>this here.</v>

563
00:31:04.750 --> 00:31:06.250
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

564
00:31:06.450 --> 00:31:08.140
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the same observation that can be,</v>

565
00:31:08.360 --> 00:31:09.193
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can be observed from this to give me </v>

566
00:31:11.650 --> 00:31:13.090
<v Speaker 1>examples.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

567
00:31:13.210 --> 00:31:14.043
<v Speaker 1>So this is a lots of works that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>introduced about the computer vision </v>

568
00:31:17.560 --> 00:31:21.640
<v Speaker 1>meets with no social network.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Actually,</v>

569
00:31:21.641 --> 00:31:22.474
<v Speaker 1>besides that in our lab with not only </v>
<v Speaker 1>are we not only do the worker uncovered </v>

570
00:31:27.460 --> 00:31:28.680
<v Speaker 1>variant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also we have some,</v>

571
00:31:28.681 --> 00:31:31.630
<v Speaker 1>some of the other works on the AI </v>
<v Speaker 1>projects.</v>

572
00:31:31.840 --> 00:31:34.590
<v Speaker 1>The most important APP or one of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>most important,</v>

573
00:31:34.670 --> 00:31:35.503
<v Speaker 1>I projected the APP plus house and we </v>
<v Speaker 1>would like to deploys a or utilize the </v>

574
00:31:40.031 --> 00:31:45.031
<v Speaker 1>AI technology to Max a health care.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And also the first,</v>

575
00:31:45.100 --> 00:31:45.933
<v Speaker 1>the healthcare,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first day is that we would like to </v>

576
00:31:47.810 --> 00:31:52.810
<v Speaker 1>ut that ai technology or deep learning </v>
<v Speaker 1>and our to analysis a medical images and</v>

577
00:31:53.080 --> 00:31:53.913
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

578
00:31:54.340 --> 00:31:59.340
<v Speaker 1>to help the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to help the doctors to Mac the uh,</v>

579
00:32:01.030 --> 00:32:02.130
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

589
00:32:35.310 --> 00:32:36.143
<v Speaker 1>a doctor to attack max attack gnosis and</v>
<v Speaker 1>also even in the future we have to have </v>

590
00:32:41.640 --> 00:32:42.473
<v Speaker 1>the doctor to Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this design the treatment about some of </v>

<v Speaker 1>because the gang,</v>

593
00:32:52.700 --> 00:32:53.533
<v Speaker 1>because tencent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the game is the largest in the number </v>
