00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.550
<v Speaker 1>Starbucks is leading the war on </v>
<v Speaker 1>Christmas in America,</v>

2
00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:05.040
<v Speaker 1>or is it just a stupid Red Cup chick fil</v>
<v Speaker 1>a's?</v>

3
00:00:05.041 --> 00:00:08.610
<v Speaker 1>Owner hates gay people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or is he just for family values?</v>

4
00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:09.803
<v Speaker 1>Donald Trump's twitter is a place for </v>
<v Speaker 1>him to speak his mind or is it just the </v>

5
00:00:12.481 --> 00:00:15.720
<v Speaker 1>place for the ramblings of a lunatic?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't even need a cell phone.</v>

6
00:00:15.721 --> 00:00:17.340
<v Speaker 1>My thoughts are sent directly to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Internet.</v>

7
00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:18.263
<v Speaker 1>Now I can reach out to their followers </v>
<v Speaker 1>and tell them where without the </v>

8
00:00:19.921 --> 00:00:22.800
<v Speaker 1>government,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do all these things have in common?</v>

9
00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:24.013
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they all have been helped by </v>

10
00:00:24.301 --> 00:00:26.280
<v Speaker 1>controversy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you don't believe me,</v>

11
00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:27.173
<v Speaker 1>let's run through them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Starbucks stock price shot up after the </v>

12
00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:30.653
<v Speaker 1>Red Cup was announced,</v>
<v Speaker 1>chick filet had record breaking sales </v>

13
00:00:31.951 --> 00:00:34.800
<v Speaker 1>that year and Donald trump is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>president.</v>

14
00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:36.053
<v Speaker 1>And why is this happening?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why does controversy always seemed to </v>

15
00:00:37.831 --> 00:00:38.664
<v Speaker 1>benefit someone?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to talk about all of this </v>

16
00:00:40.171 --> 00:00:41.130
<v Speaker 1>and more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but first,</v>

17
00:00:41.131 --> 00:00:43.800
<v Speaker 1>let me say that controversy has a fine </v>
<v Speaker 1>line to tread.</v>

18
00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.280
<v Speaker 1>There needs to be a believable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>credible viewpoint on both sides.</v>

19
00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:48.263
<v Speaker 1>So when you hear that Adam Sandler has </v>
<v Speaker 1>had a controversial movie career since </v>

20
00:00:50.311 --> 00:00:51.930
<v Speaker 1>his horror movie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jack and Jill,</v>

21
00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:54.370
<v Speaker 1>that's not true because everyone agrees </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's been bad,</v>

22
00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:55.763
<v Speaker 1>but it might be controversial to say </v>
<v Speaker 1>whether he still has a soul after </v>

23
00:00:57.931 --> 00:01:01.170
<v Speaker 1>selling it for cash.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Someone say you can't forget about happy</v>

24
00:01:01.171 --> 00:01:02.490
<v Speaker 1>Gilmore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Others would say,</v>

25
00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:04.020
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but Pixel.</v>

26
00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:06.930
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So to explain how controversy works,</v>

27
00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.030
<v Speaker 1>first we have to talk about social </v>
<v Speaker 1>media.</v>

28
00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.020
<v Speaker 1>Social media sites have become the </v>
<v Speaker 1>gatekeepers of what will be popular next</v>

29
00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.710
<v Speaker 1>and they have a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have millions of posts each day and</v>

30
00:01:16.711 --> 00:01:17.544
<v Speaker 1>need a way to allow good posts to rise </v>
<v Speaker 1>to the top and limit the reach of </v>

31
00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:21.540
<v Speaker 1>bandwidth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And because of this,</v>

32
00:01:21.541 --> 00:01:22.374
<v Speaker 1>what all social media sites having </v>
<v Speaker 1>common is that they heavily reward </v>

33
00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.120
<v Speaker 1>interaction and the reason is simple.</v>

34
00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:28.223
<v Speaker 1>How else can a social media site no to </v>
<v Speaker 1>promote something unless you click or </v>

35
00:01:30.601 --> 00:01:32.520
<v Speaker 1>type something that essentially says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

36
00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.880
<v Speaker 1>I found this post to be worth my time to</v>
<v Speaker 1>click my mouse or type on my keyboard.</v>

37
00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.180
<v Speaker 1>So maybe others will too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's a hierarchy of interaction.</v>

38
00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:40.373
<v Speaker 1>It depends on the site,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but basically the rule of thumb is </v>

39
00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.520
<v Speaker 1>whatever people tend to do least is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>most valuable.</v>

40
00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:45.473
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>comments are better than likes on </v>

41
00:01:47.221 --> 00:01:48.054
<v Speaker 1>facebook because people tend to comment </v>
<v Speaker 1>less so it shows a higher level </v>

42
00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:51.513
<v Speaker 1>engagement that someone would comment </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's why in social media what's </v>

43
00:01:53.791 --> 00:01:56.340
<v Speaker 1>more important than consensus is </v>
<v Speaker 1>conversation.</v>

44
00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:59.250
<v Speaker 1>So with all that in mind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's talk about controversy traps.</v>

45
00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:01.230
<v Speaker 1>This is where controversy gets its </v>
<v Speaker 1>power.</v>

46
00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:02.393
<v Speaker 1>There are controversy traps we fall into</v>
<v Speaker 1>that make us accidentally promote </v>

47
00:02:04.621 --> 00:02:08.220
<v Speaker 1>something when we're actually trying to </v>
<v Speaker 1>make fun of them or argue their points.</v>

48
00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:11.940
<v Speaker 1>This is because controversial things are</v>
<v Speaker 1>heavily interactive.</v>

49
00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:15.600
<v Speaker 1>They bait you into responding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you see something that strikes you as</v>

50
00:02:15.601 --> 00:02:17.970
<v Speaker 1>crazy or wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's easy to want to respond,</v>

51
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.540
<v Speaker 1>but no matter how you do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's only helping that controversy grow.</v>

52
00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:24.180
<v Speaker 1>Even if you type up a comment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I totally hate this,</v>

53
00:02:24.181 --> 00:02:26.130
<v Speaker 1>go die to facebook,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Insta,</v>

54
00:02:26.131 --> 00:02:26.964
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What you're actually saying to the </v>

55
00:02:28.261 --> 00:02:31.590
<v Speaker 1>social media site is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm engaged and interested in this,</v>

56
00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:35.070
<v Speaker 1>but there's another important element </v>
<v Speaker 1>that helps make controversy so powerful.</v>

57
00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:36.173
<v Speaker 1>It's the comment reply.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once people start commenting on other </v>

58
00:02:38.551 --> 00:02:41.130
<v Speaker 1>comments and generating entire back and </v>
<v Speaker 1>forth arguments,</v>

59
00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:43.830
<v Speaker 1>that is pure dopamine to your social </v>
<v Speaker 1>network,</v>

60
00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:44.843
<v Speaker 1>it's also fairly unique to controversial</v>
<v Speaker 1>topics and a video with consensus by </v>

61
00:02:48.181 --> 00:02:50.220
<v Speaker 1>replied to someone over and over if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>agree with it.</v>

62
00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:52.290
<v Speaker 1>For most of us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's only when we disagree with someone.</v>

63
00:02:52.291 --> 00:02:54.810
<v Speaker 1>Do we ever come at once much less </v>
<v Speaker 1>several times,</v>

64
00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:57.090
<v Speaker 1>so when you think you're arguing </v>
<v Speaker 1>throwaway account,</v>

65
00:02:57.091 --> 00:03:00.700
<v Speaker 1>1140 on the Internet on why that piece </v>
<v Speaker 1>of content should have never been made.</v>

66
00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:03.310
<v Speaker 1>You're actually smashing the like button</v>
<v Speaker 1>over and over.</v>

67
00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:05.890
<v Speaker 1>The second controversy trap is even </v>
<v Speaker 1>worse.</v>

68
00:03:05.891 --> 00:03:09.250
<v Speaker 1>It's the response article or video to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the controversial topic.</v>

69
00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:10.263
<v Speaker 1>This happens a lot where people will </v>
<v Speaker 1>share and opposing take on a piece of </v>

70
00:03:12.371 --> 00:03:13.204
<v Speaker 1>news or a person's actions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which doesn't seem like a share because </v>

71
00:03:15.311 --> 00:03:17.980
<v Speaker 1>they're taking the other side,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but just like in the case of comments,</v>

72
00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:21.160
<v Speaker 1>you're actually feeding the beast </v>
<v Speaker 1>because now your talking about something</v>

73
00:03:21.161 --> 00:03:23.830
<v Speaker 1>controversial.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This will intern drag people in from the</v>

74
00:03:23.831 --> 00:03:27.250
<v Speaker 1>other side and the cycle continues.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As long as there's someone to argue with</v>

75
00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:28.353
<v Speaker 1>and the more controversial video is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more these controversial traps are </v>

76
00:03:30.851 --> 00:03:34.210
<v Speaker 1>hard to avoid and when controversial </v>
<v Speaker 1>topics are raking in tons of views,</v>

77
00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:37.360
<v Speaker 1>this intern give that person more </v>
<v Speaker 1>incentive to make videos like that,</v>

78
00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:38.463
<v Speaker 1>which is why it's somewhat ironic when </v>
<v Speaker 1>people complain that such ridiculous </v>

79
00:03:40.631 --> 00:03:41.464
<v Speaker 1>topics gets so much attention,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're getting attention in part </v>

80
00:03:43.691 --> 00:03:44.524
<v Speaker 1>because you're commenting on them and </v>
<v Speaker 1>complaining about how much attention </v>

81
00:03:46.211 --> 00:03:47.044
<v Speaker 1>they're getting.</v>

82
00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:48.063
<v Speaker 1>So to wrap up this video,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought I'd make a quick guide to </v>

83
00:03:50.081 --> 00:03:53.770
<v Speaker 1>disliking anything on social media </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it is so non intuitive.</v>

84
00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:58.930
<v Speaker 1>Don't do anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The more outrage or annoyed you are,</v>

85
00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:00.790
<v Speaker 1>the more you should keep your mouth </v>
<v Speaker 1>shut.</v>

86
00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:04.630
<v Speaker 1>Controversial things on social media or </v>
<v Speaker 1>like a tar baby,</v>

87
00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:08.680
<v Speaker 1>react and it only gets worse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ignore it and it will go away.</v>

88
00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:09.783
<v Speaker 1>The flip side of this is if you like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>channel and want other people to know </v>

89
00:04:11.861 --> 00:04:14.110
<v Speaker 1>about that channel to you know how to </v>
<v Speaker 1>support it.</v>

90
00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:15.543
<v Speaker 1>If you liked this video,</v>
<v Speaker 1>interact with me and the others in the </v>

91
00:04:17.081 --> 00:04:18.760
<v Speaker 1>comments below,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if you didn't,</v>

92
00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:19.511
<v Speaker 1>please,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

93
00:04:19.511 --> 00:04:22.540
<v Speaker 1>please leave a mean comment in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>comments section that'll show me.</v>

94
00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:26.470
<v Speaker 1>Thanks for watching.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As a quick footnote,</v>

95
00:04:26.471 --> 00:04:28.450
<v Speaker 1>that didn't make it into the main part </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the video.</v>

96
00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:29.513
<v Speaker 1>One necessary caveat is that some social</v>
<v Speaker 1>media sites are better at suppressing </v>

97
00:04:32.231 --> 00:04:34.120
<v Speaker 1>controversy than others.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

98
00:04:34.121 --> 00:04:36.910
<v Speaker 1>some have disliked systems in place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't mean much sense.</v>

99
00:04:36.911 --> 00:04:37.744
<v Speaker 1>In places like youtube,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can get millions of hits even with </v>

100
00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:40.120
<v Speaker 1>mostly dislikes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Culver.</v>

101
00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:40.963
<v Speaker 1>In places like Reddit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have a very good system of sorting </v>

102
00:04:42.311 --> 00:04:43.144
<v Speaker 1>posts that allows for dislikes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so depending on the site you're on </v>

103
00:04:44.921 --> 00:04:47.230
<v Speaker 1>disliking a video,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe a good alternative to nothing.</v>
