1
00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:01.103
<v Speaker 1>There is no place where advertising is </v>
<v Speaker 1>more relevant than in the cigarette </v>

2
00:00:04.771 --> 00:00:07.590
<v Speaker 1>industry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brand loyalty is extremely high,</v>

3
00:00:07.591 --> 00:00:08.424
<v Speaker 1>so it's important to a cigarette company</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they're the first ones that you </v>

4
00:00:10.561 --> 00:00:11.394
<v Speaker 1>smoke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's also important to distract the </v>

5
00:00:13.021 --> 00:00:13.854
<v Speaker 1>customer from the obvious fallacy and </v>
<v Speaker 1>bargain that their product will </v>

6
00:00:15.991 --> 00:00:16.824
<v Speaker 1>eventually kill you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Necessity has made these companies </v>

7
00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:24.390
<v Speaker 1>masters at advertising and until 1970 </v>
<v Speaker 1>when cigarette advertisements were band,</v>

8
00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.240
<v Speaker 1>nobody was better at this advertising </v>
<v Speaker 1>than Marlboro.</v>

9
00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.600
<v Speaker 1>Cigarette or packaging is more </v>
<v Speaker 1>recognizable,</v>

10
00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.570
<v Speaker 1>more American,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more smoke than this one,</v>

11
00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.740
<v Speaker 1>but Marlboro did more than just when the</v>
<v Speaker 1>advertising more with their rivals.</v>

12
00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.610
<v Speaker 1>They changed advertising forever and how</v>
<v Speaker 1>did they do it?</v>

13
00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:42.473
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when Philip Morris started the company </v>

14
00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:44.820
<v Speaker 1>in 18,</v>
<v Speaker 1>47,</v>

15
00:00:44.821 --> 00:00:47.760
<v Speaker 1>it was aimed at women.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It didn't work very well at first.</v>

16
00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:48.953
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the 19 fifties when new studies came </v>

17
00:00:50.371 --> 00:00:51.204
<v Speaker 1>out that smoking caused cancer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many tobacco companies started to panic </v>

18
00:00:53.431 --> 00:00:54.450
<v Speaker 1>and change tactics.</v>

19
00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.970
<v Speaker 1>It was at this point that Marlboro made </v>
<v Speaker 1>a key.</v>

20
00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:58.403
<v Speaker 1>They switched their advertising tactic </v>
<v Speaker 1>to men and became the first ever </v>

21
00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.790
<v Speaker 1>lifestyle advertisers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

22
00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:06.940
<v Speaker 1>Pause.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Before we go further.</v>

23
00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:10.220
<v Speaker 1>It's very important that you know </v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly what lifestyle advertising looks</v>

24
00:01:10.221 --> 00:01:11.054
<v Speaker 1>like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The good news is you're already super </v>

25
00:01:12.911 --> 00:01:15.310
<v Speaker 1>familiar with lifestyle advertising.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even if you don't know it.</v>

26
00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:19.450
<v Speaker 1>It is when a commercial tries to tie its</v>
<v Speaker 1>product to something else in your life,</v>

27
00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:20.643
<v Speaker 1>a feeling and attribute satisfaction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The list is endless like when an energy </v>

28
00:01:23.621 --> 00:01:26.960
<v Speaker 1>drink ties itself to extreme athleticism</v>
<v Speaker 1>or a camera adventure,</v>

29
00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:31.250
<v Speaker 1>a soda to happiness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a car to love,</v>

30
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.750
<v Speaker 1>or a phone to more than just a phone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once you're familiar with the term,</v>

31
00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:36.673
<v Speaker 1>you'll notice it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The most popular and effective form of </v>

32
00:01:38.091 --> 00:01:41.480
<v Speaker 1>advertising that we know of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it wasn't always this way.</v>

33
00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:42.613
<v Speaker 1>Roll the clock back 60 years and people </v>
<v Speaker 1>had a much different idea of how to </v>

34
00:01:45.351 --> 00:01:46.184
<v Speaker 1>advertise your product.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Take a look at this camel ad from the </v>

35
00:01:48.831 --> 00:01:49.664
<v Speaker 1>fifties</v>

36
00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:54.280
<v Speaker 2>are mild kind of cigarette smoking camel</v>
<v Speaker 2>for 20 years.</v>

37
00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:57.820
<v Speaker 2>I know that mild and they really taste </v>
<v Speaker 2>great.</v>

38
00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.340
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cameras are so mild,</v>

39
00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:04.270
<v Speaker 2>that unattached of hundreds of people </v>
<v Speaker 2>who smoked all my camels for 30 days.</v>

40
00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:05.403
<v Speaker 2>Throat specialists making weekly </v>
<v Speaker 2>examinations reported not one single </v>

41
00:02:08.591 --> 00:02:11.440
<v Speaker 2>case of throat irritation due to smoking</v>
<v Speaker 2>camels.</v>

42
00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:14.700
<v Speaker 1>Why is this ad so unconvincing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

43
00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:19.170
<v Speaker 1>everything is fact and product oriented </v>
<v Speaker 1>by my thing over there thing because all</v>

44
00:02:19.171 --> 00:02:20.004
<v Speaker 1>our researchers say so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the truth is most of us don't care </v>

45
00:02:21.961 --> 00:02:22.794
<v Speaker 1>about that research.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm buying a pack of cigarettes to be </v>

46
00:02:24.571 --> 00:02:26.060
<v Speaker 1>cool,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not because Dr.</v>

47
00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:30.930
<v Speaker 1>say it's more smooth than a competitors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in the fifties on road changed sexes,</v>

48
00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:31.853
<v Speaker 1>they also changed their advertising </v>
<v Speaker 1>strategy by selling their product as a </v>

49
00:02:34.651 --> 00:02:37.560
<v Speaker 1>symbol rather than just on the merits of</v>
<v Speaker 1>its design.</v>

50
00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:41.070
<v Speaker 1>They did this by creating a smoking </v>
<v Speaker 1>cowboy,</v>

51
00:02:41.071 --> 00:02:41.904
<v Speaker 1>known Nathan Marlboro.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Marlboro man was designed to be the </v>

52
00:02:44.401 --> 00:02:47.580
<v Speaker 1>archetype of manliness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was hard working and living free.</v>

53
00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:49.163
<v Speaker 1>So with that last commercial in mind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>watch this commercial and notice how </v>

54
00:02:52.021 --> 00:02:52.854
<v Speaker 1>much less screen time devolver oh gets </v>
<v Speaker 1>and how the focus of the ad has shifted </v>

55
00:02:56.401 --> 00:03:00.360
<v Speaker 1>away from an isolated product to </v>
<v Speaker 1>encompass a feeling upper rough,</v>

56
00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:01.510
<v Speaker 1>rugged,</v>
<v Speaker 1>free life.</v>

57
00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.840
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they weren't just selling cigarettes,</v>

58
00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:07.060
<v Speaker 1>but rather a feeling of freedom and </v>
<v Speaker 1>adventure.</v>

59
00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:08.703
<v Speaker 1>And there's maybe a slight irony here </v>
<v Speaker 1>that most cowboys did not smoke at this </v>

60
00:03:11.651 --> 00:03:12.730
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but instead dip.</v>

61
00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:16.540
<v Speaker 1>But most people didn't care.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Within one year of this campaign,</v>

62
00:03:16.541 --> 00:03:17.374
<v Speaker 1>Marlboro went from owning less than one </v>
<v Speaker 1>percent of the market to being the </v>

63
00:03:19.571 --> 00:03:21.400
<v Speaker 1>fourth largest cigarette company in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

64
00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:22.713
<v Speaker 1>And within four more years it became the</v>
<v Speaker 1>number one selling cigarette in the </v>

65
00:03:24.911 --> 00:03:26.320
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it remains that way.</v>

66
00:03:26.321 --> 00:03:27.154
<v Speaker 1>To this day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Marlboro man is a legend in </v>

67
00:03:29.111 --> 00:03:31.570
<v Speaker 1>advertising and shape the future of </v>
<v Speaker 1>advertising forever.</v>

68
00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:34.030
<v Speaker 1>And I think no matter what your stance </v>
<v Speaker 1>on cigarettes are,</v>

69
00:03:34.031 --> 00:03:37.360
<v Speaker 1>we can all learn from our lessons to </v>
<v Speaker 1>help us communicate with others.</v>

70
00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:38.553
<v Speaker 1>People don't want to be sold a product.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People want to be sort of feeling a </v>

71
00:03:41.411 --> 00:03:42.244
<v Speaker 1>connection,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something that's worth more than the </v>

72
00:03:43.901 --> 00:03:48.901
<v Speaker 1>paper that it's printed on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's in the spirit of learning that I</v>

73
00:03:50.291 --> 00:03:51.124
<v Speaker 1>decided to change my subscribers segment</v>
<v Speaker 1>for this video to be a little more </v>

74
00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:55.250
<v Speaker 1>lifestyle oriented.</v>
