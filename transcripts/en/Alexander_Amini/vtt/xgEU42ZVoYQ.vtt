00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.460
<v Speaker 1>Why don't more people care about my </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

2
00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:06.390
<v Speaker 1>It's unbelievable the way the rest of </v>
<v Speaker 1>you just blissfully live your lives,</v>

3
00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:08.580
<v Speaker 1>unconcerned with the real issues of this</v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

4
00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:11.190
<v Speaker 1>After all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>take any aspect of your life.</v>

5
00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:14.250
<v Speaker 1>My group would agree that my thing is </v>
<v Speaker 1>the most pressing thing about it.</v>

6
00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:16.860
<v Speaker 1>Don't you all realize how serious this </v>
<v Speaker 1>is?</v>

7
00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:18.263
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's not even talk about people with a </v>

8
00:00:19.231 --> 00:00:20.064
<v Speaker 1>different opinion of my thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fact that they don't agree with my </v>

9
00:00:22.021 --> 00:00:24.300
<v Speaker 1>fax means that they're willfully </v>
<v Speaker 1>ignoring the facts.</v>

10
00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:25.920
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking to you.</v>

11
00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.180
<v Speaker 1>The one with no dog in this fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really your the one to blame here.</v>

12
00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.670
<v Speaker 1>You keep talking about your thing and </v>
<v Speaker 1>going on about that,</v>

13
00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.790
<v Speaker 1>but you have to realize by not taking </v>
<v Speaker 1>action on my thing,</v>

14
00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:36.893
<v Speaker 1>you're perpetuating the problem in </v>
<v Speaker 1>action is action and you've done quite </v>

15
00:00:40.351 --> 00:00:43.380
<v Speaker 1>enough for ready,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess silly me for thinking that other</v>

16
00:00:43.381 --> 00:00:47.250
<v Speaker 1>people would actually be logical and </v>
<v Speaker 1>reasonable for a change and realize that</v>

17
00:00:47.251 --> 00:00:49.860
<v Speaker 1>my thing should be as important to them </v>
<v Speaker 1>as it is to me.</v>

18
00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:51.083
<v Speaker 1>It just breaks my heart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why don't more people care about my </v>

19
00:00:53.161 --> 00:00:53.994
<v Speaker 1>thing?</v>

20
00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:02.083
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
