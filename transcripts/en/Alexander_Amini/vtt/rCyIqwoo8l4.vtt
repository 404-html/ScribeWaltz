<v Speaker 1>Hi Guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's been awhile.</v>

2
00:00:01.590 --> 00:00:02.423
<v Speaker 1>I've been swamped with work as well as </v>
<v Speaker 1>putting together one of my largest </v>

3
00:00:04.321 --> 00:00:05.420
<v Speaker 1>videos ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sorry.</v>

4
00:00:05.421 --> 00:00:07.290
<v Speaker 1>I hope you all bear with me while I get </v>
<v Speaker 1>that finished.</v>

5
00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:08.453
<v Speaker 1>In the gap of uploads though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really wanted to tell you about some </v>

6
00:00:10.381 --> 00:00:11.850
<v Speaker 1>awesome things that I thought couldn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>wait.</v>

7
00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:16.890
<v Speaker 1>The biggest thing is that we hit 100,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>subscribers late February,</v>

8
00:00:16.891 --> 00:00:21.300
<v Speaker 1>which is absolutely amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The same time last February,</v>

9
00:00:21.301 --> 00:00:24.240
<v Speaker 1>I had set some goals for this channel </v>
<v Speaker 1>and of all of them,</v>

10
00:00:24.241 --> 00:00:26.640
<v Speaker 1>the most ambitious of them was to get to</v>
<v Speaker 1>50,000</v>

11
00:00:26.641 --> 00:00:30.150
<v Speaker 1>subs in one year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To really understand how crazy that goal</v>

12
00:00:30.151 --> 00:00:30.984
<v Speaker 1>was to me at the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First you have to know that I had a </v>

13
00:00:32.521 --> 00:00:37.320
<v Speaker 1>youtube channel before this making piano</v>
<v Speaker 1>videos and it took me 80 videos over two</v>

14
00:00:37.321 --> 00:00:38.154
<v Speaker 1>years to get 100 subscribers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so zero to 50 K in one year was pretty </v>

15
00:00:42.481 --> 00:00:43.314
<v Speaker 1>much shooting for the moon and even by </v>
<v Speaker 1>last July I only had 300 subscribers on </v>

16
00:00:47.221 --> 00:00:48.054
<v Speaker 1>this channel.</v>

17
00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:50.370
<v Speaker 1>So I had thought that goal was dead in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the water,</v>

18
00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:53.010
<v Speaker 1>but thanks to you all who watch these </v>
<v Speaker 1>videos and shared them,</v>

19
00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.500
<v Speaker 1>we not only hit that goal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we doubled it.</v>

20
00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.540
<v Speaker 1>You all made that amazing goal possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So thank you.</v>

21
00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.020
<v Speaker 1>Now I think the question is now that we </v>
<v Speaker 1>have all these people here,</v>

22
00:01:04.021 --> 00:01:06.300
<v Speaker 1>what are we going to do to make this </v>
<v Speaker 1>channel even better?</v>

23
00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.660
<v Speaker 1>Well first we got our subreddit r slash </v>
<v Speaker 1>coffee break.</v>

24
00:01:09.661 --> 00:01:12.780
<v Speaker 1>One word started on reddit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't have many people there yet,</v>

25
00:01:12.781 --> 00:01:15.960
<v Speaker 1>but that's about to change and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to eventually become a big part of</v>

26
00:01:15.961 --> 00:01:18.000
<v Speaker 1>this community.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We already have a discord,</v>

27
00:01:18.001 --> 00:01:18.834
<v Speaker 1>which is more like a chat room,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but reddit superior comment sorting </v>

28
00:01:20.791 --> 00:01:21.624
<v Speaker 1>makes it better for group discussion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So why don't you guys to go subscribe </v>

29
00:01:23.881 --> 00:01:24.714
<v Speaker 1>over there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be a great place to meet </v>

30
00:01:25.501 --> 00:01:28.050
<v Speaker 1>like minded people and discuss videos </v>
<v Speaker 1>and ideas.</v>

31
00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.003
<v Speaker 1>It will also be a place for future </v>
<v Speaker 1>announcements such as the one in this </v>

32
00:01:31.171 --> 00:01:32.790
<v Speaker 1>video.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Secondly,</v>

33
00:01:32.791 --> 00:01:33.624
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to tell you that I do a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>research for these videos and I want to </v>

34
00:01:35.761 --> 00:01:38.850
<v Speaker 1>make that more visible going forward.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm going to be putting more and more</v>

35
00:01:38.851 --> 00:01:41.100
<v Speaker 1>effort into getting good footnotes for </v>
<v Speaker 1>these videos.</v>

36
00:01:41.101 --> 00:01:43.410
<v Speaker 1>If you want to learn more about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>subjects I talk about.</v>

37
00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:46.110
<v Speaker 1>The third thing I can't talk too much </v>
<v Speaker 1>about yet,</v>

38
00:01:46.111 --> 00:01:48.810
<v Speaker 1>but I plan on focusing more on coffee </v>
<v Speaker 1>break soon.</v>

39
00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.480
<v Speaker 1>If you look at my backlog,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I used to upload once a week,</v>

40
00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:52.763
<v Speaker 1>but that had slowed down because of work</v>
<v Speaker 1>related stuff that's going to change </v>

41
00:01:55.381 --> 00:01:56.214
<v Speaker 1>come April or May and we're going to try</v>
<v Speaker 1>to ramp back up to a more frequent </v>

42
00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:01.140
<v Speaker 1>uploads schedule.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And finally,</v>

43
00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.033
<v Speaker 1>as part of the 100 k celebration,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I decided to take this moment to </v>

44
00:02:04.831 --> 00:02:07.170
<v Speaker 1>highlight the lesser known people behind</v>
<v Speaker 1>the show,</v>

45
00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.990
<v Speaker 1>the musicians whose music I feature on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the channel.</v>

46
00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:11.103
<v Speaker 1>Music has always been huge for this </v>
<v Speaker 1>channel and I'm sure it's part of the </v>

47
00:02:12.961 --> 00:02:14.580
<v Speaker 1>reason a lot of you like listening to </v>
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>

48
00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:15.773
<v Speaker 1>So I'm going to be uploading a best of </v>
<v Speaker 1>coffee break music mix right after this </v>

49
00:02:18.151 --> 00:02:21.720
<v Speaker 1>video to essentially throw a spotlight </v>
<v Speaker 1>on just how talented these people are.</v>

50
00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:23.850
<v Speaker 1>I'm uploading it separately from this </v>
<v Speaker 1>video,</v>

51
00:02:23.851 --> 00:02:26.340
<v Speaker 1>so if you guys want to just put it on </v>
<v Speaker 1>his study music or whatever,</v>

52
00:02:26.341 --> 00:02:28.890
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to listen to my annoying </v>
<v Speaker 1>preamble every time,</v>

53
00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:32.070
<v Speaker 1>but if I could just ask of you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you go to listen to the music mix,</v>

54
00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:32.933
<v Speaker 1>if you like one of the songs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>please go check out the artist's actual </v>

55
00:02:35.341 --> 00:02:37.950
<v Speaker 1>page and comment telling them you came </v>
<v Speaker 1>from coffee break.</v>

56
00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.560
<v Speaker 1>All the artists they feature on here are</v>
<v Speaker 1>incredible,</v>

57
00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:43.050
<v Speaker 1>and the songs I show only scratched the </v>
<v Speaker 1>surface.</v>

58
00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:44.610
<v Speaker 1>All right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's pretty much it.</v>

59
00:02:44.611 --> 00:02:45.444
<v Speaker 1>To recap,</v>
<v Speaker 1>reddit more videos around April and May </v>

60
00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.860
<v Speaker 1>and go check out some of those amazing </v>
<v Speaker 1>artists.</v>

61
00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:52.500
<v Speaker 1>I feel so blessed to reach a hundred k </v>
<v Speaker 1>subs in one year,</v>

62
00:02:52.501 --> 00:02:54.480
<v Speaker 1>and I'm looking forward to where we go </v>
<v Speaker 1>from here.</v>

63
00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:56.100
<v Speaker 1>Thank you for watching.</v>
