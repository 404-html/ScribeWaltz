00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:03.780
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe I'm saying this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but youtube has gotten stale lately.</v>

2
00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:06.090
<v Speaker 1>Youtube used to be the place to go to </v>
<v Speaker 1>find cool,</v>

3
00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:10.770
<v Speaker 1>obscure videos by independent niche </v>
<v Speaker 1>craters like this or this.</v>

4
00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.810
<v Speaker 1>It was basically the antithesis of cable</v>
<v Speaker 1>tv where everything is sanitized and you</v>

5
00:00:15.811 --> 00:00:16.644
<v Speaker 1>know exactly what you're wanting to get.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Youtube used to have an effect that I'd </v>

6
00:00:18.991 --> 00:00:19.824
<v Speaker 1>like to call it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they do to black hole where you get on </v>

7
00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:21.843
<v Speaker 1>to see a retina link video and find </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself three hours later watching </v>

8
00:00:23.851 --> 00:00:24.684
<v Speaker 1>windsurfing fails compilation number </v>
<v Speaker 1>seven or the ultimate showdown of </v>

9
00:00:27.631 --> 00:00:28.464
<v Speaker 1>ultimate destiny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All through just clicking on related </v>

10
00:00:30.211 --> 00:00:31.044
<v Speaker 1>videos in the sidebar is a bit like </v>
<v Speaker 1>going down the rabbit hole in Alice in </v>

11
00:00:33.421 --> 00:00:34.254
<v Speaker 1>wonderland,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but youtube has made it harder to have </v>

12
00:00:35.161 --> 00:00:37.020
<v Speaker 1>this experience or finding fresh </v>
<v Speaker 1>content.</v>

13
00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:37.913
<v Speaker 1>This is a screen capture of when I </v>
<v Speaker 1>recently went to watch you Rhett and </v>

14
00:00:39.601 --> 00:00:40.710
<v Speaker 1>link video on this channel.</v>

15
00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:41.633
<v Speaker 1>Look at the sidebar options,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which should be the primary way to find </v>

16
00:00:43.471 --> 00:00:44.304
<v Speaker 1>new channels.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first page full is all written link </v>

17
00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:47.633
<v Speaker 1>and the few options that are different </v>
<v Speaker 1>at the very bottom are channels that I </v>

18
00:00:50.551 --> 00:00:51.384
<v Speaker 1>already have subscribed to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's absolutely nothing new to find </v>

19
00:00:53.581 --> 00:00:55.470
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How did this happen?</v>

20
00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.660
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did some digging and it has to do with</v>

21
00:00:57.661 --> 00:00:58.494
<v Speaker 1>the Youtube Algorithm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what determines what results or </v>

22
00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:01.710
<v Speaker 1>favorite show up when you search </v>
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>

23
00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.870
<v Speaker 1>It's exact inner workings are more </v>
<v Speaker 1>precious.</v>

24
00:01:03.871 --> 00:01:05.550
<v Speaker 1>That garden,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Krabby Patty formula,</v>

25
00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.250
<v Speaker 1>but people have been able to figure out </v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty much how it works.</v>

26
00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:09.443
<v Speaker 1>A few years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>youtube changes formula to favor watch </v>

27
00:01:11.191 --> 00:01:12.420
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>

28
00:01:12.421 --> 00:01:15.060
<v Speaker 1>they'd rather show you a video that will</v>
<v Speaker 1>keep you on their site for 30 minutes.</v>

29
00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:15.923
<v Speaker 1>Then one that will keep you on for 10 </v>
<v Speaker 1>minutes and that makes sense business </v>

30
00:01:18.211 --> 00:01:19.044
<v Speaker 1>wise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's also why it's so hard to find </v>

31
00:01:19.981 --> 00:01:21.060
<v Speaker 1>new channels on youtube.</v>

32
00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:21.953
<v Speaker 1>Basically it comes down to this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Youtube wants to suggest videos that it </v>

33
00:01:24.541 --> 00:01:25.374
<v Speaker 1>knows you're already likely to enjoy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the only thing it knows that you </v>

34
00:01:27.931 --> 00:01:29.460
<v Speaker 1>already liked is what you've already </v>
<v Speaker 1>watched.</v>

35
00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:30.713
<v Speaker 1>This means it's only going to feed you </v>
<v Speaker 1>more of the creators you already know </v>

36
00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:34.193
<v Speaker 1>and look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm fine with being shown more about </v>

37
00:01:34.981 --> 00:01:35.814
<v Speaker 1>subjects that I watch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it seems like lately that's all </v>

38
00:01:37.651 --> 00:01:41.820
<v Speaker 1>youtube will recommend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We need a new way to discover videos and</v>

39
00:01:41.821 --> 00:01:44.340
<v Speaker 1>if any of you suggest the trending tab,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll put you through that wall.</v>

40
00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:45.703
<v Speaker 1>It's just a bunch of TV,</v>
<v Speaker 1>late night host movie trailers or other </v>

41
00:01:47.491 --> 00:01:48.324
<v Speaker 1>mass appeal videos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't need help finding the youtubers </v>

42
00:01:51.481 --> 00:01:53.310
<v Speaker 1>I already watched.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know who they are.</v>

43
00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.860
<v Speaker 1>I want to be able to find new creators </v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never heard of.</v>

44
00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.110
<v Speaker 1>That's what made the youtube experience </v>
<v Speaker 1>special.</v>

45
00:01:58.590 --> 00:01:59.423
<v Speaker 1>But Youtube needs to change its </v>
<v Speaker 1>algorithm to take more risks with </v>

46
00:02:01.261 --> 00:02:02.094
<v Speaker 1>suggestions or we're going to all get </v>
<v Speaker 1>tired of watching more of the same </v>

47
00:02:04.351 --> 00:02:06.420
<v Speaker 1>content he always watched.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In summary,</v>

48
00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:07.283
<v Speaker 1>youtube,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're getting boring these days and </v>

49
00:02:08.701 --> 00:02:12.450
<v Speaker 1>it's time to spice things up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yours conditionally theaudience.</v>

50
00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:13.713
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

52
00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:18.040

<v Speaker 1>I think the best video,</v>

53
00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:20.230
<v Speaker 1>not the video that you found that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>were looking for,</v>

54
00:02:20.231 --> 00:02:22.030
<v Speaker 1>but the one that you found that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>weren't looking for,</v>

55
00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.883
<v Speaker 1>they're just right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you guys have had an experience </v>

56
00:02:25.871 --> 00:02:27.490
<v Speaker 1>like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>reasonably let me know.</v>

57
00:02:27.491 --> 00:02:28.540
<v Speaker 1>If you haven't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me know.</v>
