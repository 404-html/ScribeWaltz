00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:02.460
<v Speaker 1>The value of art today is a slippery </v>
<v Speaker 1>topic.</v>

2
00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:03.983
<v Speaker 1>Take a canvas out of the pump,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have an art gallery without the price </v>

3
00:00:05.851 --> 00:00:06.684
<v Speaker 1>tag and many people would find it </v>
<v Speaker 1>difficult to guess the price of the </v>

4
00:00:09.181 --> 00:00:10.014
<v Speaker 1>piece,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like when banksy set up a street stand </v>

5
00:00:11.761 --> 00:00:15.540
<v Speaker 1>for his art and almost no one noticed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's see if you can do better.</v>

6
00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.200
<v Speaker 1>Try to guess how much these pieces of </v>
<v Speaker 1>art</v>

7
00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:19.093
<v Speaker 2>cost.</v>

8
00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:40.020
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't always this difficult before </v>
<v Speaker 1>the 20th century,</v>

9
00:00:40.021 --> 00:00:43.170
<v Speaker 1>especially in Europe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a more objective measure of art.</v>

10
00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.610
<v Speaker 1>There was the hierarchy of genres </v>
<v Speaker 1>codified by the European Academy of arts</v>

11
00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.060
<v Speaker 1>with the highest genre holding more </v>
<v Speaker 1>prestige and cultural value,</v>

12
00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:52.403
<v Speaker 1>and in general,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a great artist was a master craftsman </v>

13
00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:58.800
<v Speaker 1>and intellectual capable of capturing </v>
<v Speaker 1>reality and recreating history,</v>

14
00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:01.140
<v Speaker 1>and as you look up and down the </v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy,</v>

15
00:01:01.141 --> 00:01:04.530
<v Speaker 1>it's clear that there's value given to </v>
<v Speaker 1>what is difficult faces,</v>

16
00:01:04.531 --> 00:01:06.240
<v Speaker 1>which are the hardest to paint our </v>
<v Speaker 1>weighted.</v>

17
00:01:06.241 --> 00:01:10.740
<v Speaker 1>The highest unmoving simple objects are </v>
<v Speaker 1>the lowest and excluding moral waiting.</v>

18
00:01:10.741 --> 00:01:12.840
<v Speaker 1>I think this is a pretty intuitive </v>
<v Speaker 1>valuation.</v>

19
00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.250
<v Speaker 1>What is difficult is valuable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All of this nicely agreed upon.</v>

20
00:01:17.251 --> 00:01:22.251
<v Speaker 1>Valuation was ruined by the dark room.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now known as the camera Obscura,</v>

21
00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:24.743
<v Speaker 1>the name comes from an optical </v>
<v Speaker 1>phenomenon where you can project an </v>

22
00:01:27.091 --> 00:01:29.700
<v Speaker 1>image onto a back wall through a </v>
<v Speaker 1>Pinhole,</v>

23
00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:30.863
<v Speaker 1>but the image is very dim,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you have to keep the room almost </v>

24
00:01:32.881 --> 00:01:33.714
<v Speaker 1>totally dark to see it and pretty </v>
<v Speaker 1>quickly many began realizing that with </v>

25
00:01:36.811 --> 00:01:38.190
<v Speaker 1>film,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is photosensitive.</v>

26
00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.550
<v Speaker 1>They could use the dark room to capture </v>
<v Speaker 1>moments forever.</v>

27
00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:42.533
<v Speaker 1>It all happened quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first pictures were taken in the </v>

28
00:01:44.551 --> 00:01:47.310
<v Speaker 1>early 19th century,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and by the end of that century,</v>

29
00:01:47.311 --> 00:01:51.060
<v Speaker 1>the Eastman Kodak Company was selling </v>
<v Speaker 1>cameras with film for $1.</v>

30
00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:54.840
<v Speaker 1>This shook the very ground beneath </v>
<v Speaker 1>artists feet.</v>

31
00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.900
<v Speaker 1>Remember just before this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>before photographs,</v>

32
00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:00.210
<v Speaker 1>art was the only way of capturing a </v>
<v Speaker 1>moment.</v>

33
00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:01.313
<v Speaker 1>If you wanted to remember a view,</v>
<v Speaker 1>share some technical idea or even </v>

34
00:02:04.261 --> 00:02:06.510
<v Speaker 1>commemorate your kingly face for </v>
<v Speaker 1>posterity,</v>

35
00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:09.210
<v Speaker 1>you'd need skill with a quill or the </v>
<v Speaker 1>money to buy it,</v>

36
00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:10.463
<v Speaker 1>but not anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Reality can be claimed by anybody in a </v>

37
00:02:12.841 --> 00:02:13.674
<v Speaker 1>bright flash that painted a moment with </v>
<v Speaker 1>photon perfect accuracy with a higher </v>

38
00:02:16.741 --> 00:02:19.080
<v Speaker 1>order of detailed than most painters </v>
<v Speaker 1>could dream up.</v>

39
00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.960
<v Speaker 1>Take a second.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you do as an artist?</v>

40
00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:25.050
<v Speaker 1>What do you do when portraits,</v>
<v Speaker 1>life studies,</v>

41
00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.943
<v Speaker 1>even landscapes can be memorialized </v>
<v Speaker 1>without dragging out a pot of paint or </v>

42
00:02:29.641 --> 00:02:30.474
<v Speaker 1>an easel that can be done cheaper and </v>
<v Speaker 1>faster by any untrained buffoon who's </v>

43
00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:34.793
<v Speaker 1>got a buck?</v>

44
00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:38.960
<v Speaker 1>What do you do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

45
00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.863
<v Speaker 1>for artists in the 20th century,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a wide scattering occurred with a burst </v>

46
00:02:43.291 --> 00:02:46.620
<v Speaker 1>of art that mostly avoided realism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cubism,</v>

47
00:02:46.621 --> 00:02:48.270
<v Speaker 1>fauvism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>post-impressionism,</v>

48
00:02:48.271 --> 00:02:49.740
<v Speaker 1>modernism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>surrealism.</v>

49
00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.640
<v Speaker 1>There was tons of abstraction and work </v>
<v Speaker 1>to define light,</v>

50
00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:55.500
<v Speaker 1>to copy it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Looking back,</v>

51
00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:58.650
<v Speaker 1>it's not surprising why when photography</v>
<v Speaker 1>burst into our hands,</v>

52
00:02:58.750 --> 00:02:59.583
<v Speaker 1>traditional meaning was lost for a lot </v>
<v Speaker 1>of artists and found again with </v>

53
00:03:02.801 --> 00:03:03.634
<v Speaker 1>completely different routes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of modern art is challenging the </v>

54
00:03:06.191 --> 00:03:09.250
<v Speaker 1>very idea of objective value and meaning</v>
<v Speaker 1>art.</v>

55
00:03:09.251 --> 00:03:12.250
<v Speaker 1>Today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>modern art doesn't carry an objective or</v>

56
00:03:12.251 --> 00:03:16.390
<v Speaker 1>generally agreed upon value because they</v>
<v Speaker 1>lost that along time ago.</v>

57
00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:20.410
<v Speaker 1>Instead,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the value of art is entirely subjective.</v>

58
00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:23.350
<v Speaker 1>Whatever you think that piece is worth </v>
<v Speaker 1>is what it's worth,</v>

59
00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:27.790
<v Speaker 1>and this means that for many who strike </v>
<v Speaker 1>up the intuitive and historical position</v>

60
00:03:27.791 --> 00:03:30.100
<v Speaker 1>that art value should be related to </v>
<v Speaker 1>difficulty.</v>

61
00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:31.323
<v Speaker 1>There's a paradigm sized gap between </v>
<v Speaker 1>them and the artist's prices and we </v>

62
00:03:36.101 --> 00:03:40.450
<v Speaker 1>would do well to observe the cultural </v>
<v Speaker 1>shift here in art and other places where</v>

63
00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:41.323
<v Speaker 1>technology has made something easy or </v>
<v Speaker 1>automated because the birth of the dark </v>

64
00:03:44.861 --> 00:03:45.694
<v Speaker 1>room and the way it shaped art history </v>
<v Speaker 1>gives us insights into how our modern </v>

65
00:03:49.661 --> 00:03:50.494
<v Speaker 1>world and definitions of value might </v>
<v Speaker 1>react to the upending of human </v>

66
00:03:53.831 --> 00:03:54.664
<v Speaker 1>difficulty.</v>

67
00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:01.660
<v Speaker 3>I want to be a force for real good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In other words,</v>

68
00:04:01.661 --> 00:04:02.494
<v Speaker 3>I know that there are bad forces forces </v>
<v Speaker 3>that bring suffering to others and </v>

69
00:04:05.351 --> 00:04:09.220
<v Speaker 3>misery to the world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I want to be the opposite force.</v>

70
00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:13.390
<v Speaker 3>I want to be the force which is truly </v>
<v Speaker 3>for good.</v>
