1
00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:02.700
<v Speaker 1>Real quick before this video begins,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to address a few things.</v>

2
00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:04.920
<v Speaker 1>So some of you might be thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

3
00:00:04.921 --> 00:00:08.070
<v Speaker 1>this is a lot of overkill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And to some extent you're right.</v>

4
00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:11.520
<v Speaker 1>This isn't an incredibly intensive </v>
<v Speaker 1>system that I built,</v>

5
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:12.833
<v Speaker 1>but the reason for it is because I </v>
<v Speaker 1>really believe that time management and </v>

6
00:00:16.761 --> 00:00:18.570
<v Speaker 1>is one of the most important things you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can do.</v>

7
00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:19.943
<v Speaker 1>Pretty much anything in your life is </v>
<v Speaker 1>achievable if you leverage your time in </v>

8
00:00:23.171 --> 00:00:26.370
<v Speaker 1>the right way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I just don't think most people,</v>

9
00:00:26.371 --> 00:00:27.900
<v Speaker 1>including myself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

10
00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:28.823
<v Speaker 1>for a lot of my life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have a good grip on what we do with our </v>

11
00:00:31.081 --> 00:00:34.860
<v Speaker 1>time and are very intentional with our </v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

12
00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.060
<v Speaker 1>So that's kind of the thesis behind this</v>
<v Speaker 1>whole system.</v>

13
00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.480
<v Speaker 1>And I think for anyone who's going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>embark on this,</v>

14
00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:43.343
<v Speaker 1>they should have the proper q because it</v>
<v Speaker 1>is kind of a pain to deal with this </v>

15
00:00:46.561 --> 00:00:47.370
<v Speaker 1>sometimes.</v>

16
00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.930
<v Speaker 1>But I think you have to know why you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing it and kind of like I said,</v>

17
00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:53.670
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the other video as well.</v>

18
00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.340
<v Speaker 1>If you don't like what I do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>please,</v>

19
00:00:56.341 --> 00:00:56.851
<v Speaker 1>please,</v>
<v Speaker 1>please,</v>

20
00:00:56.851 --> 00:00:57.684
<v Speaker 1>please just make your own system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why I made this smorgasborg </v>

21
00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:02.700
<v Speaker 1>system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As you can see,</v>

22
00:01:02.701 --> 00:01:03.534
<v Speaker 1>this is not some app and it's the reason</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't use an app is because of the </v>

23
00:01:06.691 --> 00:01:09.720
<v Speaker 1>fact that nothing was doing quite what I</v>
<v Speaker 1>wanted it to do.</v>

24
00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:12.600
<v Speaker 1>And so I had to make my own system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So to some extent,</v>

25
00:01:12.601 --> 00:01:14.670
<v Speaker 1>I really believe in kind of doing it </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself.</v>

26
00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.660
<v Speaker 1>So if you have the evening to do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go ahead and do that.</v>

27
00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:20.460
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's get into this video.</v>

28
00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.853
<v Speaker 1>All right guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we're going to get into the time </v>

29
00:01:24.211 --> 00:01:26.040
<v Speaker 1>management,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

30
00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.100
<v Speaker 1>spreadsheets that I have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a followup to my last video.</v>

31
00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:30.293
<v Speaker 1>So this is for those of you who actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>want to implement this system that I </v>

32
00:01:32.971 --> 00:01:33.804
<v Speaker 1>have.</v>

33
00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.900
<v Speaker 1>All right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So basically this is what it looks like.</v>

34
00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.210
<v Speaker 1>It's going to look like this when you </v>
<v Speaker 1>get it,</v>

35
00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:40.403
<v Speaker 1>the first thing you're going to want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>do is you're going to want to think </v>

36
00:01:41.671 --> 00:01:43.590
<v Speaker 1>about your day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about your life.</v>

37
00:01:43.591 --> 00:01:47.670
<v Speaker 1>You're going to think of one to think </v>
<v Speaker 1>about the types of buckets that you want</v>

38
00:01:47.671 --> 00:01:49.260
<v Speaker 1>to capture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for me,</v>

39
00:01:49.261 --> 00:01:52.260
<v Speaker 1>these are the buckets of my life that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>want to capture it miscellaneous just as</v>

40
00:01:52.261 --> 00:01:53.094
<v Speaker 1>anything that's kind of productive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but two can't really be captured in its </v>

41
00:01:55.681 --> 00:01:57.510
<v Speaker 1>own category.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like going to the grocery store,</v>

42
00:01:57.511 --> 00:01:58.800
<v Speaker 1>getting a haircut,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

43
00:01:59.130 --> 00:01:59.963
<v Speaker 1>Waste of time is just a straight up </v>
<v Speaker 1>waste of time and these others are </v>

44
00:02:01.801 --> 00:02:04.250
<v Speaker 1>pretty self explanatory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

45
00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:05.573
<v Speaker 1>So I track my time in 16 hour days </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I don't want to spend a ton of </v>

46
00:02:09.481 --> 00:02:12.300
<v Speaker 1>time putting in sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

47
00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:16.710
<v Speaker 1>I usually sleep from 11:00</v>
<v Speaker 1>PM to 8:00</v>

48
00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:17.910
<v Speaker 1>AM that's usually when I'm sleeping.</v>

49
00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:21.270
<v Speaker 1>So I just consider that that's always,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's always going to be sleep.</v>

50
00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.000
<v Speaker 1>If you want to track the whole time you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can do that.</v>

51
00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:25.233
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I would suggest tracking in 16 </v>

52
00:02:26.371 --> 00:02:27.330
<v Speaker 1>hours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just makes it easier.</v>

53
00:02:27.331 --> 00:02:29.160
<v Speaker 1>If you want to change this time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can change it here.</v>

54
00:02:29.161 --> 00:02:32.130
<v Speaker 1>Just change this first row to like 7:00</v>
<v Speaker 1>AM for example.</v>

55
00:02:32.131 --> 00:02:34.080
<v Speaker 1>And all the roads will automatically </v>
<v Speaker 1>change.</v>

56
00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:35.880
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

57
00:02:35.881 --> 00:02:36.714
<v Speaker 1>so the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>after you changed these things over </v>

58
00:02:38.041 --> 00:02:39.210
<v Speaker 1>here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these,</v>

59
00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:42.330
<v Speaker 1>these buckets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to want to change them here</v>

60
00:02:42.331 --> 00:02:43.320
<v Speaker 1>as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

61
00:02:43.321 --> 00:02:46.570
<v Speaker 1>Don't change the color because the </v>
<v Speaker 1>colors tied to the macro.</v>

62
00:02:46.571 --> 00:02:47.404
<v Speaker 1>So what's a macro?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just a short little piece of code </v>

63
00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:54.480
<v Speaker 1>that helps things go a little smoother.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So to access your macro,</v>

64
00:02:54.481 --> 00:02:55.860
<v Speaker 1>you're going to need change.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A few things.</v>

65
00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:00.790
<v Speaker 1>So you're going to go to options in </v>
<v Speaker 1>excel and then you're going to go to the</v>

66
00:03:00.791 --> 00:03:02.200
<v Speaker 1>customize ribbon page.</v>

67
00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:04.300
<v Speaker 1>You're going to click this developer </v>
<v Speaker 1>tab,</v>

68
00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:06.660
<v Speaker 1>it's just going to let you change some </v>
<v Speaker 1>things you,</v>

69
00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:07.990
<v Speaker 1>you don't need to know that much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

70
00:03:07.991 --> 00:03:11.890
<v Speaker 1>So check us out to go to this developer </v>
<v Speaker 1>tab and you go to visual basic.</v>

71
00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:16.600
<v Speaker 1>The one thing that you're going to want </v>
<v Speaker 1>to change is this file path right here.</v>

72
00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:22.270
<v Speaker 1>So whenever you get finished with a day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to press two buttons,</v>

73
00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:25.930
<v Speaker 1>you're going to press this button,</v>
<v Speaker 1>time management button,</v>

74
00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.900
<v Speaker 1>and it's going to count up all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>colors.</v>

75
00:03:28.901 --> 00:03:29.734
<v Speaker 1>So like let's fill in a day real quick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's say when teachers read some </v>

76
00:03:35.081 --> 00:03:37.030
<v Speaker 1>books,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>

77
00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:39.910
<v Speaker 1>miscellaneous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is just a sample day here.</v>

78
00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:41.590
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were worked out,</v>

79
00:03:41.591 --> 00:03:41.891
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>

80
00:03:41.891 --> 00:03:42.240
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>

81
00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:43.073
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>blah.</v>

82
00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:45.970
<v Speaker 1>It took a nap,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

83
00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:47.950
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

84
00:03:47.951 --> 00:03:50.620
<v Speaker 1>I'm just going to fill it all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

85
00:03:50.621 --> 00:03:51.454
<v Speaker 1>so you finish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you finish your day and you're going to </v>

86
00:03:53.801 --> 00:03:54.850
<v Speaker 1>hit this time management button.</v>

87
00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:57.700
<v Speaker 1>It's going to track your day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If the percentages,</v>

88
00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:00.400
<v Speaker 1>here's the total of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

89
00:04:00.401 --> 00:04:03.850
<v Speaker 1>and then you're going to go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're in press this button to before</v>

90
00:04:03.851 --> 00:04:08.851
<v Speaker 1>you knew that you don't want to change </v>
<v Speaker 1>this date to whatever your day is.</v>

91
00:04:09.341 --> 00:04:13.150
<v Speaker 1>So if the 26th of April four 26,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is how I do it,</v>

92
00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:16.120
<v Speaker 1>2017,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just going to name it whatever,</v>

93
00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:17.013
<v Speaker 1>whatever's in this first column,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just going to name your whole file </v>

94
00:04:19.121 --> 00:04:21.610
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you're going to press this button,</v>

95
00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:22.983
<v Speaker 1>we're not going to press it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're gonna press this button and </v>

96
00:04:24.301 --> 00:04:27.730
<v Speaker 1>it'll change this name to that and it'll</v>
<v Speaker 1>save it in this file path.</v>

97
00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:30.880
<v Speaker 1>But it's a specific file path right </v>
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>

98
00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:32.200
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to go here,</v>

99
00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:33.573
<v Speaker 1>you're going to create a folder that </v>
<v Speaker 1>wherever you want to save your </v>

100
00:04:36.051 --> 00:04:37.860
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 1>I chose time archives,</v>

101
00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:42.270
<v Speaker 1>so like I have this right here.</v>

102
00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:45.990
<v Speaker 1>Time archives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can just click this and then you can</v>

103
00:04:45.991 --> 00:04:47.700
<v Speaker 1>just copy it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>control c,</v>

104
00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:52.320
<v Speaker 1>and you just paste it right into here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right here.</v>

105
00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:56.130
<v Speaker 1>So keep the quotes so that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

106
00:04:56.131 --> 00:04:57.840
<v Speaker 1>that'll work out for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

107
00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:00.630
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything else should be good to go.</v>

108
00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:04.800
<v Speaker 1>Don't change the number of buckets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just try to use the same one if you can,</v>

109
00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:06.113
<v Speaker 1>unless you want to ride your own macro,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which in which case you're finding to </v>

110
00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:08.371
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

111
00:05:08.371 --> 00:05:10.230
<v Speaker 1>so that's pretty much the daily thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's,</v>

112
00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:12.690
<v Speaker 1>you press this and then you press that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

113
00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:14.223
<v Speaker 1>Alright,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so now we're going to talk a little bit </v>

114
00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:18.600
<v Speaker 1>about the review system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So here,</v>

115
00:05:18.601 --> 00:05:19.434
<v Speaker 1>let's pull that up.</v>

116
00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:24.180
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So here's a sample review template.</v>

117
00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:27.090
<v Speaker 1>This one is a lot more free.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can do a lot more things that,</v>

118
00:05:27.091 --> 00:05:27.924
<v Speaker 1>that if you want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm going to try to explain how I </v>

119
00:05:30.331 --> 00:05:31.164
<v Speaker 1>use it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you can kind of do whatever you </v>

120
00:05:31.981 --> 00:05:35.310
<v Speaker 1>want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So basically I do two different types of</v>

121
00:05:35.311 --> 00:05:36.144
<v Speaker 1>review systems I do weekly and monthly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can do them in bigger or smaller </v>

122
00:05:39.841 --> 00:05:42.090
<v Speaker 1>increments if you want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're basically going to,</v>

123
00:05:42.091 --> 00:05:43.350
<v Speaker 1>just for your own sake,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

124
00:05:43.351 --> 00:05:47.340
<v Speaker 1>In what time you're capturing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'll say like four or 26 to let's say</v>

125
00:05:47.341 --> 00:05:52.020
<v Speaker 1>I'm doing next week to uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what would next week be,</v>

126
00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:55.620
<v Speaker 1>what do we do from now be four or five </v>
<v Speaker 1>too.</v>

127
00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:56.940
<v Speaker 1>So May,</v>
<v Speaker 1>May 2nd.</v>

128
00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:00.440
<v Speaker 1>That's just so you know what you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually capturing.</v>

129
00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:01.813
<v Speaker 1>And so now we're going to ride in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's say I made a video about time </v>

130
00:06:05.691 --> 00:06:08.480
<v Speaker 1>management,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

131
00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:09.800
<v Speaker 1>that's like you write all your </v>
<v Speaker 1>achievements,</v>

132
00:06:09.801 --> 00:06:11.480
<v Speaker 1>all the things that you did that were </v>
<v Speaker 1>noteworthy.</v>

133
00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:13.880
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you're going to,</v>

134
00:06:13.881 --> 00:06:16.190
<v Speaker 1>and like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can change this around whatever fits</v>

135
00:06:16.191 --> 00:06:17.024
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to basically summarize your </v>

136
00:06:17.961 --> 00:06:18.794
<v Speaker 1>week in your own words.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How you did this is this is mainly to </v>

137
00:06:21.291 --> 00:06:24.830
<v Speaker 1>get you to think about how your week </v>
<v Speaker 1>went to get you to think about,</v>

138
00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:26.450
<v Speaker 1>do you think you're a productive?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think you weren't?</v>

139
00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:29.090
<v Speaker 1>And you're going to write like major to </v>
<v Speaker 1>do's for the next week.</v>

140
00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:30.260
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

141
00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:31.820
<v Speaker 1>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can trace that around if you want.</v>

142
00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:34.190
<v Speaker 1>Then we're going to do this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is,</v>

143
00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:35.870
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the most,</v>

144
00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:37.670
<v Speaker 1>this is the part where you actually have</v>
<v Speaker 1>to pay attention.</v>

145
00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:41.540
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So all you're going to compile your time</v>

146
00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:44.420
<v Speaker 1>from your past days that you've recorded</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the daily spreadsheet.</v>

147
00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:45.553
<v Speaker 1>So like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's go to our time archives real </v>

148
00:06:47.241 --> 00:06:48.740
<v Speaker 1>quick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry,</v>

149
00:06:48.741 --> 00:06:49.850
<v Speaker 1>this might take a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

150
00:06:49.851 --> 00:06:53.720
<v Speaker 1>so no wonder our time archives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to open up a bunch of days,</v>

151
00:06:53.721 --> 00:06:53.990
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

152
00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:56.600
<v Speaker 1>So let's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's open up just a few,</v>

153
00:06:56.860 --> 00:06:58.670
<v Speaker 1>just to give you an idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll open up for days,</v>

154
00:06:59.630 --> 00:07:00.463
<v Speaker 1>but you're going to open up whatever </v>
<v Speaker 1>days your time period is supposed to be </v>

155
00:07:02.571 --> 00:07:03.404
<v Speaker 1>reflecting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like,</v>

156
00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:05.540
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's wait for this trip.</v>

157
00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:08.990
<v Speaker 1>And so for 26 to five,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two,</v>

158
00:07:08.991 --> 00:07:11.030
<v Speaker 1>that's the days I would open up if I </v>
<v Speaker 1>were really doing this.</v>

159
00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:12.253
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then you go to those things and all </v>

160
00:07:13.881 --> 00:07:15.860
<v Speaker 1>you're gonna do is you're going to take </v>
<v Speaker 1>in this,</v>

161
00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:18.780
<v Speaker 1>this thing right here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know this,</v>

162
00:07:19.110 --> 00:07:19.943
<v Speaker 1>this right here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you're going to go back to your few </v>

163
00:07:21.591 --> 00:07:22.424
<v Speaker 1>template.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to paste that in right </v>

164
00:07:24.051 --> 00:07:25.100
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just like,</v>

165
00:07:25.101 --> 00:07:28.190
<v Speaker 1>so you're going to go to your next,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to close that out.</v>

166
00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:33.590
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to go to your next day and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to do the exact same thing,</v>

167
00:07:42.650 --> 00:07:42.951
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>

168
00:07:42.951 --> 00:07:45.290
<v Speaker 1>blah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're just going to pace right down the</v>

169
00:07:45.291 --> 00:07:46.124
<v Speaker 1>row.</v>

170
00:07:48.130 --> 00:07:50.830
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's just do three days for example.</v>

171
00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:54.570
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

172
00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:57.730
<v Speaker 1>so whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you have these three days,</v>

173
00:07:57.731 --> 00:07:59.470
<v Speaker 1>you're going to want to like put them </v>
<v Speaker 1>down like this,</v>

174
00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:01.150
<v Speaker 1>making sure there's no space between </v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

175
00:08:01.210 --> 00:08:03.070
<v Speaker 1>That's just how I read the macro.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I said,</v>

176
00:08:03.071 --> 00:08:04.480
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you know anything about VBA,</v>

177
00:08:04.481 --> 00:08:05.314
<v Speaker 1>you can change this all to suit you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then you're just going to press </v>

178
00:08:06.971 --> 00:08:10.630
<v Speaker 1>compile time sheets and it's going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>summarize it,</v>

179
00:08:10.631 --> 00:08:14.470
<v Speaker 1>right gear going to tell you how many </v>
<v Speaker 1>hours total you have,</v>

180
00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:16.033
<v Speaker 1>a percentage of your day that you spend </v>
<v Speaker 1>on each thing and the number of hours </v>

181
00:08:18.641 --> 00:08:21.940
<v Speaker 1>you did do anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's pretty much it.</v>

182
00:08:22.390 --> 00:08:23.223
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this'll give you basically the snapshot </v>

183
00:08:24.851 --> 00:08:28.030
<v Speaker 1>look of Your Week.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can graph this is if you want to get</v>

184
00:08:28.031 --> 00:08:28.864
<v Speaker 1>like a better,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more like a better way to look at your </v>

185
00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:33.100
<v Speaker 1>data.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But anyway,</v>

186
00:08:33.310 --> 00:08:34.143
<v Speaker 1>that's just up to you.</v>

187
00:08:34.420 --> 00:08:36.550
<v Speaker 1>So anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you're going to save it.</v>

188
00:08:38.550 --> 00:08:41.050
<v Speaker 1>So I'll show you what I do like month </v>
<v Speaker 1>one,</v>

189
00:08:41.051 --> 00:08:43.860
<v Speaker 1>review data or week one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>

190
00:08:43.870 --> 00:08:44.321
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>

191
00:08:44.321 --> 00:08:47.170
<v Speaker 1>week to et cetera.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>

192
00:08:47.171 --> 00:08:49.870
<v Speaker 1>that's about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

193
00:08:49.871 --> 00:08:50.471
<v Speaker 1>and then I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

194
00:08:50.471 --> 00:08:54.130
<v Speaker 1>I just save it by hand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you need any more help with these,</v>

195
00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:55.650
<v Speaker 1>these spreadsheets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sure.</v>

196
00:08:55.651 --> 00:08:57.690
<v Speaker 1>To comment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me know or whatnot.</v>

197
00:08:57.691 --> 00:08:59.640
<v Speaker 1>Review the video if you don't understand</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything.</v>

198
00:09:00.270 --> 00:09:01.103
<v Speaker 1>One thing I wanted to mention real quick</v>
<v Speaker 1>guys is let's say that you did not fill </v>

199
00:09:05.581 --> 00:09:06.414
<v Speaker 1>in something for your day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This happens to me occasionally where </v>

200
00:09:08.581 --> 00:09:10.740
<v Speaker 1>I'll just forget I'm doing something </v>
<v Speaker 1>else in busy.</v>

201
00:09:11.190 --> 00:09:12.390
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what have you,</v>

202
00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:13.770
<v Speaker 1>what do you do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

203
00:09:14.130 --> 00:09:16.590
<v Speaker 1>You want to go back in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't give yourself a hard time,</v>

204
00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:19.980
<v Speaker 1>just fill in generally what you did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just ballpark it.</v>

205
00:09:20.490 --> 00:09:21.120
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

206
00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:22.590
<v Speaker 1>the point is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is to get,</v>

207
00:09:22.890 --> 00:09:26.370
<v Speaker 1>is to try not to miss any days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So even if you have to just estimate,</v>

208
00:09:26.590 --> 00:09:31.320
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think that will do really well.</v>

209
00:09:31.321 --> 00:09:33.900
<v Speaker 1>So that's just something practical that </v>
<v Speaker 1>I've had to come to grips with.</v>

210
00:09:33.901 --> 00:09:36.600
<v Speaker 1>And sometimes you just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you forget you're doing something else,</v>

211
00:09:36.780 --> 00:09:38.220
<v Speaker 1>you just have to estimate it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's okay.</v>

212
00:09:38.221 --> 00:09:40.680
<v Speaker 1>The point is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is to build up over time,</v>

213
00:09:40.681 --> 00:09:42.840
<v Speaker 1>just this grand view of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

214
00:09:43.140 --> 00:09:46.200
<v Speaker 1>of what your time is looking like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And on the grand scheme of things,</v>

215
00:09:46.201 --> 00:09:48.660
<v Speaker 1>it's still will be pretty accurate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So yeah.</v>

216
00:09:49.050 --> 00:09:50.010
<v Speaker 1>Anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

217
00:09:50.011 --> 00:09:51.270
<v Speaker 1>guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thanks for watching.</v>
