1
00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:03.360
<v Speaker 1>Humans are really good at pattern </v>
<v Speaker 1>recognition.</v>

2
00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:06.480
<v Speaker 1>We use it in nearly every aspect of our </v>
<v Speaker 1>lives.</v>

3
00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:10.120
<v Speaker 1>Recognizing people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>knowing a song by the first few bars and</v>

4
00:00:10.121 --> 00:00:10.954
<v Speaker 1>the list is endless and in some cases </v>
<v Speaker 1>pattern recognition involves taking </v>

5
00:00:15.011 --> 00:00:15.844
<v Speaker 1>existing empirical evidence to find </v>
<v Speaker 1>trends and project future think the </v>

6
00:00:19.811 --> 00:00:20.644
<v Speaker 1>weatherman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now the problem for humans is we often </v>

7
00:00:23.051 --> 00:00:25.900
<v Speaker 1>get it wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We overemphasize some facts,</v>

8
00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:28.690
<v Speaker 1>make big judgments based on too small of</v>
<v Speaker 1>data sets,</v>

9
00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:30.303
<v Speaker 1>but technology is changing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All of this just as technology changed </v>

10
00:00:33.011 --> 00:00:33.844
<v Speaker 1>your ability to make an informed </v>
<v Speaker 1>decision on which type of barriers best </v>

11
00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:37.543
<v Speaker 1>black bear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's also going to augment and improve </v>

12
00:00:39.731 --> 00:00:42.970
<v Speaker 1>our abilities to make statistically </v>
<v Speaker 1>sound decisions based on the patterns of</v>

13
00:00:42.971 --> 00:00:46.180
<v Speaker 1>millions of other humans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some of these augmentations have already</v>

14
00:00:46.181 --> 00:00:49.810
<v Speaker 1>happened and can be examined.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is how Netflix can create a list of</v>

15
00:00:49.811 --> 00:00:53.500
<v Speaker 1>what you want to watch next based on </v>
<v Speaker 1>your viewing history and millions of the</v>

16
00:00:53.501 --> 00:00:54.450
<v Speaker 1>other people's history.</v>

17
00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:59.200
<v Speaker 1>These augmentations also help Amazon </v>
<v Speaker 1>know what you want to buy next and these</v>

18
00:00:59.201 --> 00:01:02.260
<v Speaker 1>are all good and pretty benign forms of </v>
<v Speaker 1>statistical profiling,</v>

19
00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:06.070
<v Speaker 1>but there are some implications to this </v>
<v Speaker 1>usage of big data.</v>

20
00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:06.963
<v Speaker 1>They get uncomfortable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you're prone to obsessing over </v>

21
00:01:10.421 --> 00:01:12.850
<v Speaker 1>moral dilemmas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might want to skip this one.</v>

22
00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:15.460
<v Speaker 1>So let's dive into this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's a hypothetical.</v>

23
00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:16.473
<v Speaker 1>Let's say in the US,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the number one priority is to stop the </v>

24
00:01:18.971 --> 00:01:20.880
<v Speaker 1>listening and proliferation of </v>
<v Speaker 1>nickelback.</v>

25
00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:24.310
<v Speaker 1>And after years of nickelback fans </v>
<v Speaker 1>slipping through the cracks,</v>

26
00:01:24.311 --> 00:01:27.370
<v Speaker 1>they notice something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems that 90% of all known offenders</v>

27
00:01:27.371 --> 00:01:30.790
<v Speaker 1>had green hair.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now us humans doing as we do,</v>

28
00:01:30.791 --> 00:01:31.630
<v Speaker 1>we say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

29
00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:32.733
<v Speaker 1>we only have so many policing resources.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's focus it all on these nickelback </v>

30
00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.200
<v Speaker 1>loving green haired people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now this might be more effective,</v>

31
00:01:38.201 --> 00:01:39.034
<v Speaker 1>but the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>should justice break its commitment to </v>

32
00:01:40.511 --> 00:01:42.400
<v Speaker 1>impartiality to be more effective?</v>

33
00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:44.560
<v Speaker 1>Because out of a million green haired </v>
<v Speaker 1>people search,</v>

34
00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:45.423
<v Speaker 1>maybe only one has nickelback CD.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So even though the likelihood of a </v>

35
00:01:48.131 --> 00:01:48.964
<v Speaker 1>nickelback fan having green hair is 90% </v>
<v Speaker 1>the likelihood of someone green hair </v>

36
00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:52.873
<v Speaker 1>like nickelback is 0.01%</v>
<v Speaker 1>so is it right to accuse someone of </v>

37
00:01:57.191 --> 00:02:00.070
<v Speaker 1>atrocious music tastes just based on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>trait of green hair?</v>

38
00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:01.420
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most people,</v>

39
00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:02.830
<v Speaker 1>including myself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>would say no,</v>

40
00:02:02.831 --> 00:02:05.550
<v Speaker 1>of course not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whether someone likes nickelback on only</v>

41
00:02:05.551 --> 00:02:08.070
<v Speaker 1>one trait creates an astronomical error </v>
<v Speaker 1>margin.</v>

42
00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:09.203
<v Speaker 1>So it's easy to focus on individual </v>
<v Speaker 1>rights and justice being blind and all </v>

43
00:02:11.401 --> 00:02:13.860
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But this is the problem.</v>

44
00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.770
<v Speaker 1>This error margin is going to get much </v>
<v Speaker 1>smaller soon.</v>

45
00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.963
<v Speaker 1>The digital image of each individual is </v>
<v Speaker 1>getting clearer and more nuance and </v>

46
00:02:21.121 --> 00:02:21.954
<v Speaker 1>we're starting to use ai to sift through</v>
<v Speaker 1>big data to find patterns of human </v>

47
00:02:24.331 --> 00:02:26.550
<v Speaker 1>behavior too large for humans to see on </v>
<v Speaker 1>their own.</v>

48
00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:31.770
<v Speaker 1>So what happens when the s in Iaa is </v>
<v Speaker 1>99.9%</v>

49
00:02:31.771 --> 00:02:35.730
<v Speaker 1>sure that you like nickelback based on a</v>
<v Speaker 1>hundred factors including such things as</v>

50
00:02:35.731 --> 00:02:38.400
<v Speaker 1>your spotify history of listening to </v>
<v Speaker 1>nineties rock bands,</v>

51
00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:39.543
<v Speaker 1>frequent attendance of post grunge </v>
<v Speaker 1>festivals and that Mega douchebag </v>

52
00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:42.753
<v Speaker 1>haircut.</v>

53
00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:46.750
<v Speaker 1>So what do we do then?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Suddenly a lot of questions open up,</v>

54
00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:49.840
<v Speaker 1>but it is nonetheless profiling based on</v>
<v Speaker 1>circumstantial evidence.</v>

55
00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:52.240
<v Speaker 1>Are we allowed to get a search warrant </v>
<v Speaker 1>for his house based on this?</v>

56
00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:53.403
<v Speaker 1>To what extent are we willing to let law</v>
<v Speaker 1>enforcement use modern data to catch </v>

57
00:02:56.021 --> 00:02:56.854
<v Speaker 1>criminals?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a problem that the justice </v>

58
00:02:58.211 --> 00:03:00.040
<v Speaker 1>system is going to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to grapple with soon.</v>

59
00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:00.993
<v Speaker 1>And I'm not sure we're prepared to deal </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the change in thinking that it </v>

60
00:03:02.681 --> 00:03:03.514
<v Speaker 1>might require,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nor am I sure that there is a correct </v>

61
00:03:05.381 --> 00:03:08.080
<v Speaker 1>answer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's leave our nickelback scenario.</v>

62
00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:08.943
<v Speaker 1>Sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nickelback fans and back into the real </v>

63
00:03:10.181 --> 00:03:11.014
<v Speaker 1>world for a second.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What happens when the justice system is </v>

64
00:03:12.881 --> 00:03:13.714
<v Speaker 1>99.9%</v>
<v Speaker 1>sure that this guy is going to shoot up </v>

65
00:03:15.221 --> 00:03:16.054
<v Speaker 1>a school?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Next step,</v>

66
00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:17.463
<v Speaker 1>do we lock him up before he's committed </v>
<v Speaker 1>the crime and how do we weigh the </v>

67
00:03:19.721 --> 00:03:20.554
<v Speaker 1>individual's right to innocence until </v>
<v Speaker 1>proven guilty against the collective </v>

68
00:03:23.351 --> 00:03:24.190
<v Speaker 1>desire for safety?</v>

69
00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:27.910
<v Speaker 1>And if you for one second think this </v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't a modern problem for us,</v>

70
00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:28.923
<v Speaker 1>considered this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>both the Orlando shooter and London </v>

71
00:03:31.211 --> 00:03:34.390
<v Speaker 1>terrorists were both profile to be known</v>
<v Speaker 1>risks before they attack.</v>

72
00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:36.333
<v Speaker 1>As our risk assessments become more </v>
<v Speaker 1>accurate is their moral culpability if </v>

73
00:03:39.071 --> 00:03:39.904
<v Speaker 1>we don't act on this information,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this uncomfortable dilemma is starting </v>

74
00:03:42.341 --> 00:03:44.740
<v Speaker 1>to pop up more and more and it's not </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to go away.</v>

75
00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:46.413
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like most of my videos where I make </v>

76
00:03:47.531 --> 00:03:48.364
<v Speaker 1>some final opinion on the issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really don't know the answer to this </v>

77
00:03:51.011 --> 00:03:51.844
<v Speaker 1>question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what I do know for sure it is </v>

78
00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:57.700
<v Speaker 1>technology has augmented our ability to </v>
<v Speaker 1>recognize patterns and digitally profile</v>

79
00:03:57.701 --> 00:04:01.060
<v Speaker 1>people more effectively than ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this might change the justices</v>

80
00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:04.110
<v Speaker 2>some forever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what they say?</v>

81
00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:06.480
<v Speaker 2>If you could do good things for other </v>
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>

82
00:04:06.481 --> 00:04:09.000
<v Speaker 2>you had a moral obligation to do those </v>
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>

83
00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:11.460
<v Speaker 2>That's what's at stake here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not choice.</v>

84
00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:13.210
<v Speaker 2>We sponsored that.</v>

85
00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:16.640
<v Speaker 1>Thank you guys so much for watching that</v>
<v Speaker 1>video.</v>

86
00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:18.043
<v Speaker 1>It was a blast to make and I want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>hear it from you in the comments below </v>

87
00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:20.863
<v Speaker 1>what you think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think technology will change the </v>

88
00:04:22.701 --> 00:04:25.700
<v Speaker 1>justice system and just let me know your</v>
<v Speaker 1>takeaway from the video.</v>

89
00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:29.150
<v Speaker 1>So if you liked that video,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can subscribe or watch another video</v>

90
00:04:29.151 --> 00:04:31.370
<v Speaker 1>here and I make new videos every </v>
<v Speaker 1>Wednesday,</v>

91
00:04:31.371 --> 00:04:32.390
<v Speaker 1>so I hope to see you then.</v>
