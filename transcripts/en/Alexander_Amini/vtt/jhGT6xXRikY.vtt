<v Speaker 1>player.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He hasn't been to the software that </v>

3
00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:09.233
<v Speaker 1>analyzes tennis trucks and gives details</v>
<v Speaker 1>feedback to athletes so that they can </v>

00:00:12.511 --> 00:00:15.510
<v Speaker 1>improve their performance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:16.363
<v Speaker 1>my.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My Algorithm is monitoring the initial </v>

6
00:00:18.511 --> 00:00:21.240
<v Speaker 1>data from the center until I had a </v>
<v Speaker 1>stroke.</v>

7
00:00:21.241 --> 00:00:23.730
<v Speaker 1>I will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once I hit the stroke,</v>

8
00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:24.593
<v Speaker 1>it will protect the stroke and then try </v>
<v Speaker 1>and process each of the possible stroke </v>

9
00:00:27.271 --> 00:00:30.710
<v Speaker 1>types I could have possibly been hit </v>
<v Speaker 1>once a stroke is a process.</v>

10
00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:31.573
<v Speaker 1>This process by its provided back to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>athlete by feedback and also a precise </v>

11
00:00:36.961 --> 00:00:37.794
<v Speaker 1>and unbiased feedback is provided based </v>
<v Speaker 1>on small deviations that were performed </v>

12
00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:44.520
<v Speaker 1>and that could be used to improve the </v>
<v Speaker 1>stroke for the next time.</v>

13
00:00:44.521 --> 00:00:45.354
<v Speaker 1>That was it.</v>
