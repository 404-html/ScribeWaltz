00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:02.700
<v Speaker 1>There are two ways to use music as the </v>
<v Speaker 1>foreground itself,</v>

2
00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:03.563
<v Speaker 1>an object of attention or as the </v>
<v Speaker 1>background that contextualizes the rest </v>

3
00:00:06.211 --> 00:00:09.360
<v Speaker 1>of your world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Instrumental music often falls into that</v>

4
00:00:09.361 --> 00:00:11.430
<v Speaker 1>latter category.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Humble and unassuming.</v>

5
00:00:11.431 --> 00:00:12.264
<v Speaker 1>Most people overlook this kind of music </v>
<v Speaker 1>in favor of music that has a direct </v>

6
00:00:14.911 --> 00:00:16.170
<v Speaker 1>message.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

7
00:00:16.171 --> 00:00:17.004
<v Speaker 1>instrumental music almost never comes up</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the charts and the same way that </v>

8
00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:20.033
<v Speaker 1>songs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it just doesn't capture people's </v>

9
00:00:21.121 --> 00:00:24.810
<v Speaker 1>attention in the same way and I think </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's because many people misunderstand</v>

10
00:00:24.811 --> 00:00:25.644
<v Speaker 1>the role of instrumental music.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We often listen to instrumentals as we </v>

11
00:00:28.231 --> 00:00:31.800
<v Speaker 1>would a song and that's a mistake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When we listened to songs,</v>

12
00:00:31.801 --> 00:00:32.634
<v Speaker 1>our mind is automatically parsing it for</v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning for understanding of the </v>

13
00:00:34.951 --> 00:00:35.784
<v Speaker 1>songwriters message.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you do that with an instrumental </v>

14
00:00:37.591 --> 00:00:39.810
<v Speaker 1>piece,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll be sorely disappointed because in</v>

15
00:00:39.811 --> 00:00:42.330
<v Speaker 1>an instrumental meaning and message </v>
<v Speaker 1>aren't explicit.</v>

16
00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.840
<v Speaker 1>That's left up to you and I want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>examine this difference through the song</v>

17
00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:46.793
<v Speaker 1>entitled five by Kendrick Lamar because </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a significant portion of the </v>

18
00:00:49.711 --> 00:00:52.410
<v Speaker 1>song that is an instrumental before </v>
<v Speaker 1>Kendrick comes into rap,</v>

19
00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:55.770
<v Speaker 1>and this perfectly illustrates what is </v>
<v Speaker 1>gained and lost when explicit meaning is</v>

20
00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:57.710
<v Speaker 1>given.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In the beginning of this piece,</v>

21
00:00:57.711 --> 00:00:58.670
<v Speaker 1>we hear a jazz camp</v>

22
00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:11.520
<v Speaker 1>on his own.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We may call to mind a friend,</v>

23
00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.740
<v Speaker 1>a sunny day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the smell of espresso,</v>

24
00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.650
<v Speaker 1>a hipster coffee shop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We are free to give meaning,</v>

25
00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:17.963
<v Speaker 1>but this vanishes when Kendrick comes </v>
<v Speaker 1>into rap because he begins to tell a </v>

26
00:01:20.431 --> 00:01:22.140
<v Speaker 1>story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got 100 no,</v>

27
00:01:22.141 --> 00:01:27.141
<v Speaker 1>my dad's name in the grab bag in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>trunk.</v>

28
00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.900
<v Speaker 1>So even though we gained something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when Kendrick comes in a clever story,</v>

29
00:01:30.901 --> 00:01:32.740
<v Speaker 1>different viewpoints,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we also lose something.</v>

30
00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:36.030
<v Speaker 1>Whatever meeting to song could have </v>
<v Speaker 1>helped to us after it's intended.</v>

31
00:01:36.031 --> 00:01:36.864
<v Speaker 1>Meaning is explicitly told.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now of course there's always room for </v>

32
00:01:40.021 --> 00:01:43.530
<v Speaker 1>some interpretation songs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but our interpretation has been limited.</v>

33
00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:46.590
<v Speaker 1>You're no longer in a coffee shop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're in Kendrick's car.</v>

34
00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.210
<v Speaker 1>It's not a sunny day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's raining God on the engine.</v>

35
00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:51.053
<v Speaker 1>This fed off in the brain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is how Kendrick Lamar can help </v>

36
00:01:56.221 --> 00:01:59.790
<v Speaker 1>us understand instrumentals through what</v>
<v Speaker 1>we lose when he starts rapping,</v>

37
00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.150
<v Speaker 1>we lose focus on our own world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is replaced with his,</v>

38
00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:07.020
<v Speaker 1>and there's nothing wrong with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I myself love getting lost in Kendrick's</v>

39
00:02:07.021 --> 00:02:07.854
<v Speaker 1>vivid world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you understand this difference </v>

40
00:02:09.271 --> 00:02:10.104
<v Speaker 1>between songs and instrumentals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you may find the instrumentals can fill </v>

41
00:02:12.301 --> 00:02:13.134
<v Speaker 1>a gap.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That song's camp songs for most people </v>

42
00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:16.013
<v Speaker 1>are too distracting for studying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>having a conversation with someone or </v>

43
00:02:18.331 --> 00:02:20.610
<v Speaker 1>reading a book because they say too </v>
<v Speaker 1>much.</v>

44
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.490
<v Speaker 1>But instrumentals perfectly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lay a mood without trudy.</v>

45
00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:25.103
<v Speaker 1>So assuming you don't already tried </v>
<v Speaker 1>turning on an instrumental for a change </v>

46
00:02:27.661 --> 00:02:31.380
<v Speaker 1>and see how it affects you differently,</v>
<v Speaker 1>construct your own meaning and message.</v>

47
00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:35.393
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thanks for watching this video as a </v>
