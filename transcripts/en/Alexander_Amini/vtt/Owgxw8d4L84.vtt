1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.250
<v Speaker 1>So this is going to be a very different </v>
<v Speaker 1>type of video.</v>

2
00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:03.570
<v Speaker 1>We're going to talk about time </v>
<v Speaker 1>management.</v>

3
00:00:03.571 --> 00:00:04.404
<v Speaker 1>There are a million ways to do this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we're going to talk about the way </v>

4
00:00:06.511 --> 00:00:07.344
<v Speaker 1>that I do it specifically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I found one way that works really well </v>

5
00:00:09.721 --> 00:00:10.554
<v Speaker 1>for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I became self employed this last </v>

6
00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:13.583
<v Speaker 1>January and one of the quickest things </v>
<v Speaker 1>that appeared to me is that it's a big </v>

7
00:00:16.021 --> 00:00:19.860
<v Speaker 1>deal to know how to manage your time and</v>
<v Speaker 1>really you have a twofold problem.</v>

8
00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:20.813
<v Speaker 1>One,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to create and prioritize your </v>

9
00:00:22.561 --> 00:00:25.650
<v Speaker 1>goals and deadlines.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And on the other hand you have to have a</v>

10
00:00:25.651 --> 00:00:26.484
<v Speaker 1>way to manage your time such that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>achieve those goals and deadlines in a </v>

11
00:00:29.371 --> 00:00:31.680
<v Speaker 1>timely manner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And here's a fair disclaimer.</v>

12
00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:32.543
<v Speaker 1>My system might not work for you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the important thing is to take what </v>

13
00:00:35.491 --> 00:00:36.324
<v Speaker 1>you find useful here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>apply it to whatever you do and just </v>

14
00:00:39.151 --> 00:00:39.984
<v Speaker 1>leave the rest.</v>

15
00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:41.220
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so let's get into it.</v>

16
00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:42.990
<v Speaker 1>I do three main things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I managed my time.</v>

17
00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.850
<v Speaker 1>Number one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just have a planner.</v>

18
00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:45.713
<v Speaker 1>You know this is pretty boiler plate </v>
<v Speaker 1>just to record any kind of trip </v>

19
00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:50.213
<v Speaker 1>appointment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Meaning something time sensitive that I </v>

20
00:00:52.021 --> 00:00:53.850
<v Speaker 1>need to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's not much else to say there.</v>

21
00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:55.013
<v Speaker 1>Number two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I block out my day into 15 minute </v>

22
00:00:56.371 --> 00:00:58.740
<v Speaker 1>increments and fill them out as the day </v>
<v Speaker 1>goes.</v>

23
00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.510
<v Speaker 1>I got this idea from the venture </v>
<v Speaker 1>capitalists,</v>

24
00:01:00.511 --> 00:01:02.160
<v Speaker 1>Mike Jackson,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's featured in the book.</v>

25
00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:03.023
<v Speaker 1>So good they can't ignore you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The reason for doing this is that I can </v>

26
00:01:06.031 --> 00:01:06.864
<v Speaker 1>create a snapshot of what my day looked </v>
<v Speaker 1>like and I can see what I spent all my </v>

27
00:01:10.321 --> 00:01:11.154
<v Speaker 1>time on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I usually fill in the sheet whenever </v>

28
00:01:12.601 --> 00:01:13.434
<v Speaker 1>I complete a major task.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if editing this video took me from </v>

29
00:01:15.961 --> 00:01:17.160
<v Speaker 1>12:00</v>
<v Speaker 1>PM to 4:00</v>

30
00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:21.180
<v Speaker 1>PM I'll just fill in those blocks all at</v>
<v Speaker 1>once and I use colors to designate that.</v>

31
00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:22.493
<v Speaker 1>If you create your own version of this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to have to make your own </v>

32
00:01:23.611 --> 00:01:27.240
<v Speaker 1>buckets that are relevant to your life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So at the beginning of each day it looks</v>

33
00:01:27.241 --> 00:01:29.280
<v Speaker 1>like this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and by the end of it,</v>

34
00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:30.143
<v Speaker 1>it looks like this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And at this point I use a little macro </v>

35
00:01:32.431 --> 00:01:36.450
<v Speaker 1>that I created to count up all the 15 </v>
<v Speaker 1>minute increments so I can see that,</v>

36
00:01:36.451 --> 00:01:37.284
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I spent,</v>

37
00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:39.690
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this percent working out today.</v>

38
00:01:39.691 --> 00:01:42.240
<v Speaker 1>I spent this percent reading,</v>
<v Speaker 1>et cetera.</v>

39
00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.640
<v Speaker 1>Then we put in the date and hit this </v>
<v Speaker 1>button,</v>

40
00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.310
<v Speaker 1>which saves the file into just this time</v>
<v Speaker 1>archive folder,</v>

41
00:01:47.311 --> 00:01:49.290
<v Speaker 1>which I have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I'll show you right here.</v>

42
00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.530
<v Speaker 1>What's really cool about this is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>after doing it for like four months now,</v>

43
00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:53.603
<v Speaker 1>I can look back on any given day of </v>
<v Speaker 1>those four months and I can see exactly </v>

44
00:01:56.281 --> 00:01:59.010
<v Speaker 1>what I was doing at any given time </v>
<v Speaker 1>during the day,</v>

45
00:01:59.070 --> 00:01:59.903
<v Speaker 1>which is really cool and this brings us </v>
<v Speaker 1>full circle to number three and number </v>

46
00:02:03.781 --> 00:02:04.080
<v Speaker 1>three.</v>

47
00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:08.010
<v Speaker 1>I have review periods where I see how </v>
<v Speaker 1>much of my goals I achieved,</v>

48
00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:09.203
<v Speaker 1>what my progress was and how much of my </v>
<v Speaker 1>week or month or whatever review period </v>

49
00:02:12.511 --> 00:02:13.344
<v Speaker 1>I'm doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How much of that month was dedicated to </v>

50
00:02:15.271 --> 00:02:16.104
<v Speaker 1>the right things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how much of it could have been better </v>

51
00:02:17.761 --> 00:02:19.560
<v Speaker 1>allocated somewhere else,</v>
<v Speaker 1>et cetera.</v>

52
00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:20.813
<v Speaker 1>Basically I'm looking to see what I did </v>
<v Speaker 1>right and what I did wrong and what I </v>

53
00:02:23.311 --> 00:02:26.220
<v Speaker 1>can achieve better next time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a super underrated thing.</v>

54
00:02:26.221 --> 00:02:28.500
<v Speaker 1>People think that just because your time</v>
<v Speaker 1>is in the past,</v>

55
00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:31.530
<v Speaker 1>you should never look back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You should absolutely look back.</v>

56
00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:32.843
<v Speaker 1>All good time management system should </v>
<v Speaker 1>have some type of review system to see </v>

57
00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:37.283
<v Speaker 1>how you actually did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anytime that you add in any extra </v>

58
00:02:39.991 --> 00:02:41.220
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some kind of goal,</v>

59
00:02:41.221 --> 00:02:42.054
<v Speaker 1>some kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know you want to try running once a </v>

60
00:02:43.501 --> 00:02:44.334
<v Speaker 1>week,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to know how you did and so </v>

61
00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:47.430
<v Speaker 1>that's what this allows you to do.</v>

62
00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:51.120
<v Speaker 1>So in this sample week you can see how </v>
<v Speaker 1>much I read,</v>

63
00:02:51.121 --> 00:02:53.850
<v Speaker 1>how much I worked out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how much time I wasted,</v>

64
00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:55.740
<v Speaker 1>the percentage of my week that it all </v>
<v Speaker 1>took up.</v>

65
00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:59.890
<v Speaker 1>And this is super powerful to let you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know where you can improve.</v>

66
00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:01.360
<v Speaker 1>If you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh man,</v>

67
00:03:01.361 --> 00:03:02.680
<v Speaker 1>I spend more time on that than I </v>
<v Speaker 1>thought,</v>

68
00:03:02.681 --> 00:03:05.020
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to move that over here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can do that.</v>

69
00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:05.913
<v Speaker 1>So that's pretty much it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This time management system has been </v>

70
00:03:07.361 --> 00:03:10.990
<v Speaker 1>absolutely essential to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think if you're an entrepreneur or</v>

71
00:03:10.991 --> 00:03:15.070
<v Speaker 1>you're somebody who is self employed or </v>
<v Speaker 1>just you know anybody who's very serious</v>

72
00:03:15.071 --> 00:03:17.620
<v Speaker 1>about their time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think something like this would really</v>

73
00:03:17.621 --> 00:03:18.454
<v Speaker 1>help you out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm going to leave my daily </v>

74
00:03:20.711 --> 00:03:25.330
<v Speaker 1>spreadsheets as well as my review </v>
<v Speaker 1>spreadsheets in the links below with all</v>

75
00:03:25.331 --> 00:03:26.164
<v Speaker 1>the macros already in them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm going to create a second video </v>

76
00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:30.700
<v Speaker 1>to explain how to use them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If your interested also,</v>

79
00:03:36.011 --> 00:03:37.300
<v Speaker 1>awesome as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
