00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:03.520
<v Speaker 1>Last year's winner was Alexandra </v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] from Dublin.</v>

2
00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:04.563
<v Speaker 1>He was 15 when he won the competition </v>
<v Speaker 1>with his work on tennis sensor data </v>

3
00:00:08.771 --> 00:00:10.870
<v Speaker 1>analysis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it didn't stop there.</v>

4
00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:13.180
<v Speaker 1>I was doing a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sullivan has been finding out</v>

5
00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:24.803
<v Speaker 2>seating at the bt young scientists </v>
<v Speaker 2>competition is all about hard work and </v>

6
00:00:28.741 --> 00:00:32.310
<v Speaker 2>no one exemplifies this more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And last year's winner Alexander,</v>

7
00:00:32.311 --> 00:00:35.010
<v Speaker 2>I'm Mimi,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he arrived in Ireland from New York,</v>

8
00:00:35.011 --> 00:00:35.844
<v Speaker 2>but he's found he just two years ago </v>
<v Speaker 2>quickly set his sights on the </v>

9
00:00:38.791 --> 00:00:39.624
<v Speaker 2>competition.</v>

10
00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:45.570
<v Speaker 1>It was a really something that came to </v>
<v Speaker 1>me like overnight because uh,</v>

11
00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:50.790
<v Speaker 1>I play a lot of tennis and it was just </v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea of trying to create a system to</v>

12
00:00:51.071 --> 00:00:54.220
<v Speaker 1>help tennis players because coaching can</v>
<v Speaker 1>be so expensive.</v>

13
00:00:54.221 --> 00:00:57.940
<v Speaker 1>It's something that is a such a luxury </v>
<v Speaker 1>for tennis athletes.</v>

14
00:00:57.941 --> 00:01:02.320
<v Speaker 1>So to have something like a program that</v>
<v Speaker 1>can provide real time feedback,</v>

15
00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:03.543
<v Speaker 1>unbiased feedback to an athlete in real </v>
<v Speaker 1>time is just a necessity for every time </v>

16
00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:08.373
<v Speaker 1>I sit down.</v>

17
00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:12.400
<v Speaker 2>Alexander has been playing from a very </v>
<v Speaker 2>early age,</v>

18
00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:16.840
<v Speaker 2>so it probably wasn't surprising he </v>
<v Speaker 2>chose to incorporate in this project.</v>

19
00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:21.680
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my whole family faced this actually.</v>

20
00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:25.430
<v Speaker 1>So I have two sisters and one brother.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We all play tennis.</v>

21
00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:27.560
<v Speaker 1>My Dad started us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

22
00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:30.140
<v Speaker 1>to play tennis and he's been all of our </v>
<v Speaker 1>coach.</v>

23
00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:33.713
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so my project is just a motion </v>

24
00:01:35.371 --> 00:01:36.204
<v Speaker 1>refinement and recognition system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I turned my projects for tennis and </v>

25
00:01:39.711 --> 00:01:40.544
<v Speaker 1>specific.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what it does is just recognized as </v>

26
00:01:42.781 --> 00:01:43.614
<v Speaker 1>the type of motions that a athlete or a </v>
<v Speaker 1>person is performing and then tries to </v>

27
00:01:46.891 --> 00:01:48.990
<v Speaker 1>provide feedback on how to improve these</v>
<v Speaker 1>motions.</v>

28
00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:55.030
<v Speaker 2>Alexandre use the facilities here at </v>
<v Speaker 2>tennis Ireland in Dcu for his project as</v>

29
00:01:55.031 --> 00:01:55.864
<v Speaker 2>their courts can be filmed from several </v>
<v Speaker 2>different angles from cameras located </v>

30
00:01:58.840 --> 00:01:59.673
<v Speaker 2>high on the walls.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Alexandra use the raw data from tennis </v>

31
00:02:02.861 --> 00:02:03.694
<v Speaker 2>sessions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>played here to write his own computer </v>

32
00:02:05.471 --> 00:02:06.304
<v Speaker 2>program which can interpret how good </v>
<v Speaker 2>your tennis swing is from the signal </v>

33
00:02:09.431 --> 00:02:12.040
<v Speaker 2>sent from a motion sensor worn on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>wrist.</v>

34
00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:17.410
<v Speaker 2>He used 13 different computer languages </v>
<v Speaker 2>to write the software and unsurprisingly</v>

35
00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:18.910
<v Speaker 2>wild the judges,</v>

36
00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:21.920
<v Speaker 3>the bt young scientists and </v>
<v Speaker 3>technologists.</v>

37
00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:23.630
<v Speaker 3>I'll the year 2011</v>

38
00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:25.270
<v Speaker 2>is it</v>

39
00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:26.103
<v Speaker 3>Alexander?</v>

40
00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:31.123
<v Speaker 4>This I have to say is well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the best ones we've ever seen at a </v>

41
00:02:34.251 --> 00:02:38.260
<v Speaker 4>working level in terms of research.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is an excellent project compared to</v>

42
00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:39.213
<v Speaker 4>a an honors undergraduate degree level </v>
<v Speaker 4>or even postgraduate degree level </v>

43
00:02:42.701 --> 00:02:44.800
<v Speaker 4>research project.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

44
00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:45.753
<v Speaker 4>he has taken a very complex problem,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is applied very complicated techniques </v>

45
00:02:50.381 --> 00:02:52.840
<v Speaker 4>to try and solve the problem and he's </v>
<v Speaker 4>brought it to completion.</v>

46
00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:54.010
<v Speaker 4>It's a really good piece of work</v>

47
00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:58.170
<v Speaker 2>and it has an immediate practical </v>
<v Speaker 2>application.</v>

48
00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:00.220
<v Speaker 2>As a tennis coach myself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's fantastic</v>

49
00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:01.053
<v Speaker 5>to have this tool to m to use with </v>
<v Speaker 5>tennis players to help them develop </v>

50
00:03:03.701 --> 00:03:05.600
<v Speaker 5>their strokes and to to analyze this </v>
<v Speaker 5>rogue.</v>

51
00:03:05.601 --> 00:03:06.050
<v Speaker 5>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

52
00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:09.530
<v Speaker 5>it's an incredible discovery was done </v>
<v Speaker 5>very well with a chair.</v>

53
00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.913
<v Speaker 2>Of course it didn't end there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Alexandra is project was automatically </v>

54
00:03:14.011 --> 00:03:17.970
<v Speaker 2>entered into the European Union contest </v>
<v Speaker 2>for young scientists and again,</v>

55
00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:19.410
<v Speaker 2>won first prize.</v>

56
00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:22.880
<v Speaker 1>There's four or five days and I think </v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

57
00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:24.463
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the atmosphere in the exhibition was </v>

58
00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:30.530
<v Speaker 1>also incredible because you have top </v>
<v Speaker 1>competitors,</v>

59
00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:31.543
<v Speaker 1>they're winners of their national </v>
<v Speaker 1>competition all coming together to </v>

60
00:03:34.311 --> 00:03:36.710
<v Speaker 1>compete.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>

61
00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:39.590
<v Speaker 1>that is just being recognized for </v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

62
00:03:39.591 --> 00:03:42.340
<v Speaker 1>You pour your heart and soul into,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

63
00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:43.813
<v Speaker 1>working on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So constantly to be recognized for </v>

64
00:03:45.321 --> 00:03:46.850
<v Speaker 1>something like that is just a huge </v>
<v Speaker 1>honor.</v>

65
00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:50.000
<v Speaker 2>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone at his school in Castle,</v>

66
00:03:50.001 --> 00:03:52.430
<v Speaker 2>not college,</v>
<v Speaker 2>couldn't be brighter from the first</v>

67
00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:56.380
<v Speaker 5>arrived until this very moment.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's been just tough class,</v>

68
00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:00.190
<v Speaker 5>an absolutely excellent student,</v>
<v Speaker 5>very dedicated.</v>

69
00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:02.270
<v Speaker 5>He said to me on the first day,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

70
00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:04.510
<v Speaker 5>when he wants to do the young scientist </v>
<v Speaker 5>project,</v>

71
00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:07.260
<v Speaker 5>so I'm going to win it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And he won it.</v>

72
00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:11.350
<v Speaker 5>I started to laugh but I shouldn't have.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But a very dedicated,</v>

73
00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:14.350
<v Speaker 5>he doesn't sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He works and Works and works.</v>

74
00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:16.930
<v Speaker 5>Nobody asked it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>realizes how hard he works,</v>

75
00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:21.140
<v Speaker 5>give her a rising tides,</v>
<v Speaker 5>lift all boats.</v>

76
00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:22.363
<v Speaker 5>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the entry this year we have never had </v>

77
00:04:25.161 --> 00:04:27.790
<v Speaker 5>more interest into the young scientists </v>
<v Speaker 5>at all sorts.</v>

78
00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:28.633
<v Speaker 5>Increase the uptake of science subjects </v>
<v Speaker 5>biology with three classes to leave us </v>

79
00:04:32.791 --> 00:04:33.624
<v Speaker 5>or biology.</v>

80
00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:37.040
<v Speaker 2>The hard work hasn't ended for Alexandra</v>
<v Speaker 2>though.</v>

81
00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:38.203
<v Speaker 2>He skipped a school year in order to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>the leaving cert early this July and </v>

82
00:04:41.721 --> 00:04:43.760
<v Speaker 2>he's continuing to develop this project.</v>

83
00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:44.873
<v Speaker 1>I've have two patents on my project and </v>
<v Speaker 1>I hope to develop it further in the </v>

84
00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:53.070
<v Speaker 1>coming months and years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's applicable to tennis,</v>

85
00:04:53.071 --> 00:04:53.904
<v Speaker 1>but also a wide range of other fields.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'd love to start testing on things </v>

86
00:04:57.781 --> 00:05:02.781
<v Speaker 1>like medical applications and sports </v>
<v Speaker 1>rehabilitation,</v>

87
00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:05.390
<v Speaker 1>medical rehabilitation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and things like this.</v>

88
00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:07.020
<v Speaker 1>I think it has much more often</v>

89
00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:12.560
<v Speaker 2>something like tennis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Congratulations once again to Alexander,</v>

90
00:05:14.331 --> 00:05:16.090
<v Speaker 2>and we wish them the very best for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>future.</v>
