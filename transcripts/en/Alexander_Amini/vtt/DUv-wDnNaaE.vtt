00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:01.590
<v Speaker 1>Every year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the US Postal Service,</v>

2
00:00:01.591 --> 00:00:05.220
<v Speaker 1>since on average 41 pounds of junk mail </v>
<v Speaker 1>to you to achieve that feat,</v>

3
00:00:05.221 --> 00:00:06.054
<v Speaker 1>companies spin $47,000,000,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>a year to get that garbage in your </v>

4
00:00:08.731 --> 00:00:09.564
<v Speaker 1>mailbox.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a nuisance and all that paper adds </v>

5
00:00:11.281 --> 00:00:14.700
<v Speaker 1>up to 26 million trees being cut down </v>
<v Speaker 1>each year just for junk mail.</v>

6
00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:18.030
<v Speaker 1>Most of it going to the landfill,</v>
<v Speaker 1>44 percent of it never even opened.</v>

7
00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:19.111
<v Speaker 1>Also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every day,</v>

8
00:00:19.111 --> 00:00:23.460
<v Speaker 1>$54 billion spam emails are sent at </v>
<v Speaker 1>eight pieces of spam for every man,</v>

9
00:00:23.461 --> 00:00:25.590
<v Speaker 1>woman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and child on earth per day.</v>

10
00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:26.593
<v Speaker 1>You've got mail and also everyday </v>
<v Speaker 1>telemarketers call 80 million people in </v>

11
00:00:30.061 --> 00:00:31.620
<v Speaker 1>the U,</v>
<v Speaker 1>s with courtesy calls,</v>

12
00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.640
<v Speaker 1>which is such a shamelessly ironic term </v>
<v Speaker 1>that it has all been obliterated.</v>

13
00:00:35.641 --> 00:00:36.474
<v Speaker 1>The meaning of courtesy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is lead most people to not even </v>

14
00:00:38.281 --> 00:00:40.200
<v Speaker 1>answer a number if it's not in their </v>
<v Speaker 1>contact list,</v>

15
00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:41.753
<v Speaker 1>and all of this just boils down to being</v>
<v Speaker 1>unknown to you and ultimately waste her </v>

16
00:00:44.941 --> 00:00:45.300
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

17
00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:46.133
<v Speaker 1>Every second you have to spend during </v>
<v Speaker 1>way mail sorting emails are screening </v>

18
00:00:48.601 --> 00:00:50.580
<v Speaker 1>calls.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Luckily people like us,</v>

19
00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:51.443
<v Speaker 1>I've already complained in the past and </v>
<v Speaker 1>solutions had been created for these </v>

20
00:00:53.311 --> 00:00:54.144
<v Speaker 1>problems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The problem is they aren't very well </v>

21
00:00:55.531 --> 00:00:56.364
<v Speaker 1>known or advertise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so people aren't taking advantage of </v>

22
00:00:57.931 --> 00:01:00.690
<v Speaker 1>them and we're about to change that junk</v>
<v Speaker 1>mail.</v>

23
00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.570
<v Speaker 1>Two solutions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first DMA choice.org.</v>

24
00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:04.613
<v Speaker 1>The DMA is the largest direct marketing </v>
<v Speaker 1>organization in the US and they send </v>

25
00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.180
<v Speaker 1>most of the junk mail that you get on </v>
<v Speaker 1>this website.</v>

26
00:01:09.181 --> 00:01:12.450
<v Speaker 1>You can opt out from receiving junk mail</v>
<v Speaker 1>from any and all of their advertisers.</v>

27
00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.330
<v Speaker 1>There's a $2 processing fee,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it'll keep you off there.</v>

28
00:01:15.331 --> 00:01:17.400
<v Speaker 1>Do not contact mailing list for 10 </v>
<v Speaker 1>years,</v>

29
00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.020
<v Speaker 1>so I think it's worth it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Second,</v>

30
00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.700
<v Speaker 1>opt out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Prescreened.com.</v>

31
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:21.833
<v Speaker 1>It's a free service that puts you on a </v>
<v Speaker 1>do not mail list for credit card and </v>

32
00:01:24.181 --> 00:01:25.740
<v Speaker 1>insurance offers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

33
00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:26.633
<v Speaker 1>Next spam email.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to use DMA choice that org </v>

34
00:01:28.951 --> 00:01:29.784
<v Speaker 1>for this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>

35
00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:30.713
<v Speaker 1>on that same website,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can also opt out from hearing from </v>

36
00:01:32.341 --> 00:01:35.700
<v Speaker 1>any of their companies by email and this</v>
<v Speaker 1>will last six years and it's free.</v>

37
00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.160
<v Speaker 1>Also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>make sure you have a gmail account which</v>

38
00:01:38.161 --> 00:01:39.750
<v Speaker 1>has a great spam filter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

39
00:01:39.751 --> 00:01:42.090
<v Speaker 1>Finally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>courtesy calls do not call.gov.</v>

40
00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:43.770
<v Speaker 1>have you ever answered an unknown </v>
<v Speaker 1>number?</v>

41
00:01:43.771 --> 00:01:44.730
<v Speaker 1>Just to hear this,</v>

42
00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:47.083
<v Speaker 2>congratulations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've been selected to receive a free </v>

43
00:01:49.701 --> 00:01:50.840
<v Speaker 2>cruise to the Bahamas.</v>

44
00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:52.610
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Federal Trade Commission has started</v>

45
00:01:52.611 --> 00:01:53.444
<v Speaker 1>a do not call registry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That makes it illegal for telemarketers </v>

46
00:01:55.341 --> 00:01:56.174
<v Speaker 1>to do that to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's free and it takes two minutes to </v>

47
00:01:57.771 --> 00:01:59.450
<v Speaker 1>sign your number up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't expire,</v>

48
00:01:59.451 --> 00:02:03.170
<v Speaker 1>so you never have to renew this and any </v>
<v Speaker 1>telemarketer calling anyone on this list</v>

49
00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.320
<v Speaker 1>will be fined up to $40,000.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

50
00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:06.163
<v Speaker 1>that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can knock all this out in less than </v>

51
00:02:07.041 --> 00:02:09.620
<v Speaker 1>two minutes and it will save you a ton </v>
<v Speaker 1>of time and headache in the future.</v>

52
00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:10.693
<v Speaker 1>This has been a public service </v>
<v Speaker 1>announcement from coffee break and you </v>

53
00:02:12.231 --> 00:02:13.310
<v Speaker 1>guys have a great week.</v>
