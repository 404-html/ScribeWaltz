00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:04.070
<v Speaker 1>John stewart and his mission to satirize</v>
<v Speaker 1>the news was too successful.</v>

2
00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:04.963
<v Speaker 1>Ultimately,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his work resulted in the proliferation </v>

3
00:00:06.561 --> 00:00:07.394
<v Speaker 1>of the news comedy format Ad Nauseum,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a conglomerate that has become large </v>

4
00:00:10.521 --> 00:00:12.620
<v Speaker 1>enough to resemble the thing they set </v>
<v Speaker 1>out to mock.</v>

5
00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:13.583
<v Speaker 1>Let's start with news networks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They too were victims of their own </v>

6
00:00:15.621 --> 00:00:16.454
<v Speaker 1>success,</v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning that their success made them </v>

7
00:00:17.571 --> 00:00:18.404
<v Speaker 1>betray their ideals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>News started out as a much humbler </v>

8
00:00:20.961 --> 00:00:23.630
<v Speaker 1>servient profession.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure it was still a partisan,</v>

9
00:00:23.631 --> 00:00:27.050
<v Speaker 1>but there's a whole lot less of it and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it carried some form of values including</v>

10
00:00:27.051 --> 00:00:28.130
<v Speaker 1>truth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>independence,</v>

11
00:00:28.131 --> 00:00:30.830
<v Speaker 1>fairness and impartiality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But in the sixties,</v>

12
00:00:30.831 --> 00:00:34.580
<v Speaker 1>this change news networks realized that </v>
<v Speaker 1>by getting advertisers involved,</v>

13
00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.070
<v Speaker 1>you could make heaps of cash hand over </v>
<v Speaker 1>fist,</v>

14
00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.933
<v Speaker 1>fist over Mike's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's a lot of nuance that I have </v>

15
00:00:40.131 --> 00:00:41.720
<v Speaker 1>to skate over here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in essence,</v>

16
00:00:41.721 --> 00:00:44.870
<v Speaker 1>those values of journalism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the reason most got into the game,</v>

17
00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:47.510
<v Speaker 1>they're squeezed into 24 slash seven </v>
<v Speaker 1>news cycle.</v>

18
00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:49.303
<v Speaker 1>This was one of John Stewart's main </v>
<v Speaker 1>premises in the daily show that the 24 </v>

19
00:00:52.641 --> 00:00:56.870
<v Speaker 1>hour news cycle is a system that is </v>
<v Speaker 1>antithetical to good honest journalism.</v>

20
00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:58.840
<v Speaker 2>Media in general.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You said it yourself.</v>

21
00:00:58.960 --> 00:00:59.793
<v Speaker 2>It is focused on conflict,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's focused on creating drama and a </v>

22
00:01:03.311 --> 00:01:05.410
<v Speaker 2>false sense of urgency for better or for</v>
<v Speaker 2>worse,</v>

23
00:01:05.411 --> 00:01:06.244
<v Speaker 2>at 24 hour networks are now the leading </v>
<v Speaker 2>light of our information age of 24 hour </v>

24
00:01:09.821 --> 00:01:12.010
<v Speaker 2>news networks are built for one thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's nine slash 11.</v>

25
00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:13.173
<v Speaker 2>In the absence of that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not just going to say there's </v>

26
00:01:15.821 --> 00:01:20.230
<v Speaker 2>not that much that's urgent or important</v>
<v Speaker 2>or conflicted happening today,</v>

27
00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:21.213
<v Speaker 2>so we are going to gen up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We are going to bring forth more </v>

28
00:01:25.361 --> 00:01:26.194
<v Speaker 2>conflict and more sensationalism because</v>
<v Speaker 2>we want you to continue watching us 24 </v>

29
00:01:29.891 --> 00:01:31.300
<v Speaker 2>hours a day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>seven days a week,</v>

30
00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:35.620
<v Speaker 2>even when the news doesn't necessarily </v>
<v Speaker 2>warrant that type of behavior,</v>

31
00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:39.873
<v Speaker 1>and in this ecosystem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuart thrive precisely because he </v>

32
00:01:42.461 --> 00:01:45.700
<v Speaker 1>wasn't a journalist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's there to throw popcorn at the TV.</v>

33
00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:50.980
<v Speaker 1>He's there to mock sensational dialogue </v>
<v Speaker 1>and insincerity and the daily show finds</v>

34
00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:51.993
<v Speaker 1>enormous success,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but Stewart made a mark beyond himself </v>

35
00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:56.980
<v Speaker 1>in the wake of his success.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The daily show turned out,</v>

36
00:01:56.981 --> 00:01:59.800
<v Speaker 1>satire host the way SNL turned out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Comedians,</v>

37
00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:01.143
<v Speaker 1>the daily show's original correspondence</v>
<v Speaker 1>now correspond almost completely to the </v>

38
00:02:04.361 --> 00:02:07.240
<v Speaker 1>current comedy news programming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>John Oliver,</v>

39
00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:08.870
<v Speaker 1>Samantha Bee,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Steven Cole,</v>

40
00:02:08.871 --> 00:02:10.330
<v Speaker 1>bear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jordan Kepler,</v>

41
00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:14.440
<v Speaker 1>there are a glut of these all daily show</v>
<v Speaker 1>apprentices and many of these have fun,</v>

42
00:02:14.441 --> 00:02:17.530
<v Speaker 1>a lot of success,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which has had ripple effects across late</v>

43
00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:20.140
<v Speaker 1>night who are scrambling to compete with</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is working.</v>

44
00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:22.560
<v Speaker 1>Jimmy Kimmel has found his political </v>
<v Speaker 1>views,</v>

45
00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:24.540
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and although he sounds very earnest,</v>

46
00:02:24.541 --> 00:02:27.060
<v Speaker 1>isn't that good timing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jimmy Fallon tried it on.</v>

47
00:02:27.061 --> 00:02:30.090
<v Speaker 1>Seth Meyers show has gotten political </v>
<v Speaker 1>and SNL has raised.</v>

48
00:02:30.091 --> 00:02:31.050
<v Speaker 1>They're already politicized.</v>

49
00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:34.350
<v Speaker 1>Show to a fever pitch of grandstanding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The list could go on,</v>

50
00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:35.243
<v Speaker 1>so let's summarize.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've got a bunch of really successful </v>

51
00:02:37.351 --> 00:02:39.570
<v Speaker 1>shows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>making money hand over fist that are all</v>

52
00:02:39.571 --> 00:02:42.420
<v Speaker 1>competing for the same eyes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rely on corrupt,</v>

53
00:02:42.421 --> 00:02:43.254
<v Speaker 1>crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sensational things to happen every day </v>

54
00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:47.340
<v Speaker 1>to make into theater for their nightly </v>
<v Speaker 1>shows.</v>

55
00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:50.070
<v Speaker 1>Lineup up all these shows and they start</v>
<v Speaker 1>to resemble something.</v>

56
00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.560
<v Speaker 1>Something that would garner spit balls </v>
<v Speaker 1>from the back.</v>

57
00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:53.813
<v Speaker 1>They all sound the same spoken like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>guy who's suspiciously worried that </v>

58
00:02:57.331 --> 00:02:59.860
<v Speaker 1>racist presidents don't get statues </v>
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>

59
00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:03.550
<v Speaker 1>Is Donald trump a racist?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll let you decide.</v>

60
00:03:03.551 --> 00:03:04.900
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For Yourself.</v>

61
00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:08.120
<v Speaker 1>America might be white supremacists </v>
<v Speaker 1>show.</v>

62
00:03:08.121 --> 00:03:11.290
<v Speaker 1>In my opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this has everything to do with race.</v>

63
00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:13.083
<v Speaker 1>It can be hypercritical of political </v>
<v Speaker 1>villains and apologists for political </v>

64
00:03:15.311 --> 00:03:17.110
<v Speaker 1>allies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank you,</v>

65
00:03:17.111 --> 00:03:20.080
<v Speaker 1>Steven.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what I love about America.</v>

66
00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:22.840
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the only place where a secretary of</v>

67
00:03:22.841 --> 00:03:26.410
<v Speaker 1>state can be put on equal footing with a</v>
<v Speaker 1>screaming cantaloupe.</v>

68
00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:27.990
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fair enough.</v>

69
00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:29.063
<v Speaker 3>Fair enough.</v>

70
00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:34.320
<v Speaker 1>Are you concerned about the news that </v>
<v Speaker 1>Russians may have hacked our election?</v>

71
00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:37.110
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hillary lies because she didn't campaign</v>

72
00:03:37.111 --> 00:03:39.220
<v Speaker 1>in the swing states.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Moscow.</v>

73
00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:43.910
<v Speaker 1>It's a red state.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I understand.</v>

74
00:03:43.911 --> 00:03:44.421
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I understand.</v>

75
00:03:44.421 --> 00:03:45.254
<v Speaker 1>I understand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They become defacto journalists serving </v>

76
00:03:46.791 --> 00:03:48.170
<v Speaker 1>many Americans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their news,</v>

77
00:03:48.171 --> 00:03:51.740
<v Speaker 1>and they've become political actors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't vote for Steven Harper.</v>

78
00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:52.763
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

79
00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:55.893
<v Speaker 1>Satire News became what they be held.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They overdramatize the absurdity of </v>

80
00:03:59.381 --> 00:04:00.214
<v Speaker 1>politics to make headlines.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They pandered to a political party </v>

81
00:04:02.681 --> 00:04:03.514
<v Speaker 1>instead of at least trying to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>centrist and during slow news days with </v>

82
00:04:06.911 --> 00:04:09.340
<v Speaker 1>so many political comedy shows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what can they do?</v>

83
00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:10.930
<v Speaker 1>But to use stewards phrase,</v>

84
00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:13.850
<v Speaker 2>we're going to gen up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to,</v>

85
00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:14.733
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bring forth more conflict and more </v>

86
00:04:16.791 --> 00:04:20.810
<v Speaker 2>sensationalism because we want you to </v>
<v Speaker 2>continue watching us 24 hours a day,</v>

87
00:04:20.811 --> 00:04:21.644
<v Speaker 2>seven days a week,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even when the news doesn't necessarily </v>

88
00:04:24.201 --> 00:04:26.000
<v Speaker 2>warrant that type of behavior.</v>

89
00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:29.970
<v Speaker 1>All of the things that John Stewart sent</v>
<v Speaker 1>out to ridicule in news networks,</v>

90
00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:32.340
<v Speaker 1>all our failings that his own proteges </v>
<v Speaker 1>have.</v>

91
00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:34.800
<v Speaker 1>And that is the tragedy of Jon Stewart.</v>

92
00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:40.743
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

93
00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:10.490
<v Speaker 3>I think so.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If I'm wrong,</v>

94
00:05:10.491 --> 00:05:11.720
<v Speaker 3>I'm joking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Obviously.</v>
