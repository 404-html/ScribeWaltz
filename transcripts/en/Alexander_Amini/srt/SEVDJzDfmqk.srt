1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:02,700
Real quick before this video begins,
I want to address a few things.

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:04,920
So some of you might be thinking,
man,

3
00:00:04,921 --> 00:00:08,070
this is a lot of overkill.
And to some extent you're right.

4
00:00:08,190 --> 00:00:11,520
This isn't an incredibly intensive 
system that I built,

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:12,833
but the reason for it is because I 
really believe that time management and 

6
00:00:16,761 --> 00:00:18,570
is one of the most important things you 
can do.

7
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:19,943
Pretty much anything in your life is 
achievable if you leverage your time in 

8
00:00:23,171 --> 00:00:26,370
the right way.
And I just don't think most people,

9
00:00:26,371 --> 00:00:27,900
including myself,
you know,

10
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:28,823
for a lot of my life,
have a good grip on what we do with our 

11
00:00:31,081 --> 00:00:34,860
time and are very intentional with our 
time.

12
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:39,060
So that's kind of the thesis behind this
whole system.

13
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:42,480
And I think for anyone who's going to 
embark on this,

14
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:43,343
they should have the proper q because it
is kind of a pain to deal with this 

15
00:00:46,561 --> 00:00:47,370
sometimes.

16
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:51,930
But I think you have to know why you're 
doing it and kind of like I said,

17
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:53,670
uh,
in the other video as well.

18
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:56,340
If you don't like what I do,
please,

19
00:00:56,341 --> 00:00:56,851
please,
please,

20
00:00:56,851 --> 00:00:57,684
please just make your own system.
That's why I made this smorgasborg 

21
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:02,700
system.
As you can see,

22
00:01:02,701 --> 00:01:03,534
this is not some app and it's the reason
I didn't use an app is because of the 

23
00:01:06,691 --> 00:01:09,720
fact that nothing was doing quite what I
wanted it to do.

24
00:01:10,050 --> 00:01:12,600
And so I had to make my own system.
So to some extent,

25
00:01:12,601 --> 00:01:14,670
I really believe in kind of doing it 
yourself.

26
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:18,660
So if you have the evening to do that,
go ahead and do that.

27
00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:20,460
All right,
let's get into this video.

28
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:21,853
All right guys.
So we're going to get into the time 

29
00:01:24,211 --> 00:01:26,040
management,
uh,

30
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:29,100
spreadsheets that I have.
This is a followup to my last video.

31
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:30,293
So this is for those of you who actually
want to implement this system that I 

32
00:01:32,971 --> 00:01:33,804
have.

33
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,900
All right?
So basically this is what it looks like.

34
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:39,210
It's going to look like this when you 
get it,

35
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:40,403
the first thing you're going to want to 
do is you're going to want to think 

36
00:01:41,671 --> 00:01:43,590
about your day,
about your life.

37
00:01:43,591 --> 00:01:47,670
You're going to think of one to think 
about the types of buckets that you want

38
00:01:47,671 --> 00:01:49,260
to capture.
So for me,

39
00:01:49,261 --> 00:01:52,260
these are the buckets of my life that I 
want to capture it miscellaneous just as

40
00:01:52,261 --> 00:01:53,094
anything that's kind of productive,
but two can't really be captured in its 

41
00:01:55,681 --> 00:01:57,510
own category.
Like going to the grocery store,

42
00:01:57,511 --> 00:01:58,800
getting a haircut,
something like that.

43
00:01:59,130 --> 00:01:59,963
Waste of time is just a straight up 
waste of time and these others are 

44
00:02:01,801 --> 00:02:04,250
pretty self explanatory.
Okay.

45
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:05,573
So I track my time in 16 hour days 
because I don't want to spend a ton of 

46
00:02:09,481 --> 00:02:12,300
time putting in sleep.
Uh,

47
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:16,710
I usually sleep from 11:00
PM to 8:00

48
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:17,910
AM that's usually when I'm sleeping.

49
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:21,270
So I just consider that that's always,
that's always going to be sleep.

50
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,000
If you want to track the whole time you 
can do that.

51
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,233
Uh,
but I would suggest tracking in 16 

52
00:02:26,371 --> 00:02:27,330
hours.
It just makes it easier.

53
00:02:27,331 --> 00:02:29,160
If you want to change this time,
you can change it here.

54
00:02:29,161 --> 00:02:32,130
Just change this first row to like 7:00
AM for example.

55
00:02:32,131 --> 00:02:34,080
And all the roads will automatically 
change.

56
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:35,880
Um,
all right,

57
00:02:35,881 --> 00:02:36,714
so the,
after you changed these things over 

58
00:02:38,041 --> 00:02:39,210
here,
these,

59
00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:42,330
these buckets,
you're going to want to change them here

60
00:02:42,331 --> 00:02:43,320
as well.
Okay.

61
00:02:43,321 --> 00:02:46,570
Don't change the color because the 
colors tied to the macro.

62
00:02:46,571 --> 00:02:47,404
So what's a macro?
It's just a short little piece of code 

63
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:54,480
that helps things go a little smoother.
So to access your macro,

64
00:02:54,481 --> 00:02:55,860
you're going to need change.
A few things.

65
00:02:56,090 --> 00:03:00,790
So you're going to go to options in 
excel and then you're going to go to the

66
00:03:00,791 --> 00:03:02,200
customize ribbon page.

67
00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:04,300
You're going to click this developer 
tab,

68
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:06,660
it's just going to let you change some 
things you,

69
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:07,990
you don't need to know that much.
Okay?

70
00:03:07,991 --> 00:03:11,890
So check us out to go to this developer 
tab and you go to visual basic.

71
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:16,600
The one thing that you're going to want 
to change is this file path right here.

72
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:22,270
So whenever you get finished with a day,
you're going to press two buttons,

73
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:25,930
you're going to press this button,
time management button,

74
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:28,900
and it's going to count up all the 
colors.

75
00:03:28,901 --> 00:03:29,734
So like let's fill in a day real quick.
So let's say when teachers read some 

76
00:03:35,081 --> 00:03:37,030
books,
whatever,

77
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:39,910
miscellaneous,
this is just a sample day here.

78
00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:41,590
Okay,
we were worked out,

79
00:03:41,591 --> 00:03:41,891
blah,
blah,

80
00:03:41,891 --> 00:03:42,240
blah,
blah,

81
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,073
blah,
blah.

82
00:03:43,610 --> 00:03:45,970
It took a nap,
whatever.

83
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:47,950
Okay,
whatever.

84
00:03:47,951 --> 00:03:50,620
I'm just going to fill it all.
Okay,

85
00:03:50,621 --> 00:03:51,454
so you finish,
you finish your day and you're going to 

86
00:03:53,801 --> 00:03:54,850
hit this time management button.

87
00:03:54,970 --> 00:03:57,700
It's going to track your day.
If the percentages,

88
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,400
here's the total of course,
uh,

89
00:04:00,401 --> 00:04:03,850
and then you're going to go,
if you're in press this button to before

90
00:04:03,851 --> 00:04:08,851
you knew that you don't want to change 
this date to whatever your day is.

91
00:04:09,341 --> 00:04:13,150
So if the 26th of April four 26,
this is how I do it,

92
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:16,120
2017,
it's just going to name it whatever,

93
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:17,013
whatever's in this first column,
it's just going to name your whole file 

94
00:04:19,121 --> 00:04:21,610
that,
so you're going to press this button,

95
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:22,983
we're not going to press it,
but you're gonna press this button and 

96
00:04:24,301 --> 00:04:27,730
it'll change this name to that and it'll
save it in this file path.

97
00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:30,880
But it's a specific file path right 
here.

98
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,200
It's,
you're going to go here,

99
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:33,573
you're going to create a folder that 
wherever you want to save your 

100
00:04:36,051 --> 00:04:37,860
[inaudible].
I chose time archives,

101
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:42,270
so like I have this right here.

102
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:45,990
Time archives.
You can just click this and then you can

103
00:04:45,991 --> 00:04:47,700
just copy it,
control c,

104
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:52,320
and you just paste it right into here,
right here.

105
00:04:52,970 --> 00:04:56,130
So keep the quotes so that,
uh,

106
00:04:56,131 --> 00:04:57,840
that'll work out for you.
And then,

107
00:04:58,350 --> 00:05:00,630
yeah,
everything else should be good to go.

108
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:04,800
Don't change the number of buckets,
just try to use the same one if you can,

109
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,113
unless you want to ride your own macro,
which in which case you're finding to 

110
00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:08,371
that.
Okay,

111
00:05:08,371 --> 00:05:10,230
so that's pretty much the daily thing.
I think that's,

112
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:12,690
you press this and then you press that.
Okay.

113
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:14,223
Alright,
so now we're going to talk a little bit 

114
00:05:15,330 --> 00:05:18,600
about the review system.
So here,

115
00:05:18,601 --> 00:05:19,434
let's pull that up.

116
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:24,180
Okay.
So here's a sample review template.

117
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:27,090
This one is a lot more free.
You can do a lot more things that,

118
00:05:27,091 --> 00:05:27,924
that if you want,
but I'm going to try to explain how I 

119
00:05:30,331 --> 00:05:31,164
use it.
And you can kind of do whatever you 

120
00:05:31,981 --> 00:05:35,310
want.
So basically I do two different types of

121
00:05:35,311 --> 00:05:36,144
review systems I do weekly and monthly.
You can do them in bigger or smaller 

122
00:05:39,841 --> 00:05:42,090
increments if you want.
So you're basically going to,

123
00:05:42,091 --> 00:05:43,350
just for your own sake,
right?

124
00:05:43,351 --> 00:05:47,340
In what time you're capturing.
So I'll say like four or 26 to let's say

125
00:05:47,341 --> 00:05:52,020
I'm doing next week to uh,
what would next week be,

126
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:55,620
what do we do from now be four or five 
too.

127
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:56,940
So May,
May 2nd.

128
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:00,440
That's just so you know what you're 
actually capturing.

129
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:01,813
And so now we're going to ride in.
Let's say I made a video about time 

130
00:06:05,691 --> 00:06:08,480
management,
man,

131
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:09,800
that's like you write all your 
achievements,

132
00:06:09,801 --> 00:06:11,480
all the things that you did that were 
noteworthy.

133
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:13,880
Um,
and then you're going to,

134
00:06:13,881 --> 00:06:16,190
and like I said,
you can change this around whatever fits

135
00:06:16,191 --> 00:06:17,024
you.
I'm going to basically summarize your 

136
00:06:17,961 --> 00:06:18,794
week in your own words.
How you did this is this is mainly to 

137
00:06:21,291 --> 00:06:24,830
get you to think about how your week 
went to get you to think about,

138
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:26,450
do you think you're a productive?
Do you think you weren't?

139
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:29,090
And you're going to write like major to 
do's for the next week.

140
00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:30,260
Uh,
there,

141
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:31,820
like I said,
you can trace that around if you want.

142
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:34,190
Then we're going to do this.
This is,

143
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:35,870
uh,
the most,

144
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:37,670
this is the part where you actually have
to pay attention.

145
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:41,540
Okay?
So all you're going to compile your time

146
00:06:41,570 --> 00:06:44,420
from your past days that you've recorded
in the daily spreadsheet.

147
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:45,553
So like,
let's go to our time archives real 

148
00:06:47,241 --> 00:06:48,740
quick.
I'm sorry,

149
00:06:48,741 --> 00:06:49,850
this might take a little bit.
Okay,

150
00:06:49,851 --> 00:06:53,720
so no wonder our time archives,
we're going to open up a bunch of days,

151
00:06:53,721 --> 00:06:53,990
right?

152
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:56,600
So let's,
let's open up just a few,

153
00:06:56,860 --> 00:06:58,670
just to give you an idea.
We'll open up for days,

154
00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:00,463
but you're going to open up whatever 
days your time period is supposed to be 

155
00:07:02,571 --> 00:07:03,404
reflecting.
So like,

156
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:05,540
okay,
let's wait for this trip.

157
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:08,990
And so for 26 to five,
two,

158
00:07:08,991 --> 00:07:11,030
that's the days I would open up if I 
were really doing this.

159
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:12,253
Okay?
So then you go to those things and all 

160
00:07:13,881 --> 00:07:15,860
you're gonna do is you're going to take 
in this,

161
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:18,780
this thing right here.
You know this,

162
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:19,943
this right here.
And you're going to go back to your few 

163
00:07:21,591 --> 00:07:22,424
template.
You're going to paste that in right 

164
00:07:24,051 --> 00:07:25,100
here.
Just like,

165
00:07:25,101 --> 00:07:28,190
so you're going to go to your next,
you're going to close that out.

166
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:33,590
I'm going to go to your next day and 
you're going to do the exact same thing,

167
00:07:42,650 --> 00:07:42,951
blah,
blah,

168
00:07:42,951 --> 00:07:45,290
blah.
You're just going to pace right down the

169
00:07:45,291 --> 00:07:46,124
row.

170
00:07:48,130 --> 00:07:50,830
Okay,
let's just do three days for example.

171
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:54,570
Um,
okay,

172
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,730
so whatever.
So you have these three days,

173
00:07:57,731 --> 00:07:59,470
you're going to want to like put them 
down like this,

174
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:01,150
making sure there's no space between 
them.

175
00:08:01,210 --> 00:08:03,070
That's just how I read the macro.
Like I said,

176
00:08:03,071 --> 00:08:04,480
if you,
if you know anything about VBA,

177
00:08:04,481 --> 00:08:05,314
you can change this all to suit you,
but then you're just going to press 

178
00:08:06,971 --> 00:08:10,630
compile time sheets and it's going to 
summarize it,

179
00:08:10,631 --> 00:08:14,470
right gear going to tell you how many 
hours total you have,

180
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,033
a percentage of your day that you spend 
on each thing and the number of hours 

181
00:08:18,641 --> 00:08:21,940
you did do anything.
That's pretty much it.

182
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:23,223
Uh,
this'll give you basically the snapshot 

183
00:08:24,851 --> 00:08:28,030
look of Your Week.
You can graph this is if you want to get

184
00:08:28,031 --> 00:08:28,864
like a better,
more like a better way to look at your 

185
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:33,100
data.
But anyway,

186
00:08:33,310 --> 00:08:34,143
that's just up to you.

187
00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:36,550
So anyway,
then you're going to save it.

188
00:08:38,550 --> 00:08:41,050
So I'll show you what I do like month 
one,

189
00:08:41,051 --> 00:08:43,860
review data or week one,
blah,

190
00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:44,321
blah,
blah,

191
00:08:44,321 --> 00:08:47,170
week to et cetera.
So yeah,

192
00:08:47,171 --> 00:08:49,870
that's about it.
Uh,

193
00:08:49,871 --> 00:08:50,471
and then I just,
yeah,

194
00:08:50,471 --> 00:08:54,130
I just save it by hand.
So if you need any more help with these,

195
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,650
these spreadsheets,
sure.

196
00:08:55,651 --> 00:08:57,690
To comment,
let me know or whatnot.

197
00:08:57,691 --> 00:08:59,640
Review the video if you don't understand
anything.

198
00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:01,103
One thing I wanted to mention real quick
guys is let's say that you did not fill 

199
00:09:05,581 --> 00:09:06,414
in something for your day.
This happens to me occasionally where 

200
00:09:08,581 --> 00:09:10,740
I'll just forget I'm doing something 
else in busy.

201
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:12,390
You know,
what have you,

202
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,770
what do you do?
Okay.

203
00:09:14,130 --> 00:09:16,590
You want to go back in,
don't give yourself a hard time,

204
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,980
just fill in generally what you did,
just ballpark it.

205
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:21,120
But,
uh,

206
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,590
the point is,
is to get,

207
00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:26,370
is to try not to miss any days.
So even if you have to just estimate,

208
00:09:26,590 --> 00:09:31,320
um,
and I think that will do really well.

209
00:09:31,321 --> 00:09:33,900
So that's just something practical that 
I've had to come to grips with.

210
00:09:33,901 --> 00:09:36,600
And sometimes you just,
you forget you're doing something else,

211
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:38,220
you just have to estimate it.
It's okay.

212
00:09:38,221 --> 00:09:40,680
The point is,
is to build up over time,

213
00:09:40,681 --> 00:09:42,840
just this grand view of,
uh,

214
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:46,200
of what your time is looking like.
And on the grand scheme of things,

215
00:09:46,201 --> 00:09:48,660
it's still will be pretty accurate.
So yeah.

216
00:09:49,050 --> 00:09:50,010
Anyway.
Okay,

217
00:09:50,011 --> 00:09:51,270
guys,
thanks for watching.
