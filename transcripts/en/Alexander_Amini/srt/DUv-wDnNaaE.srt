1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:01,590
Every year,
the US Postal Service,

2
00:00:01,591 --> 00:00:05,220
since on average 41 pounds of junk mail 
to you to achieve that feat,

3
00:00:05,221 --> 00:00:06,054
companies spin $47,000,000,000
a year to get that garbage in your 

4
00:00:08,731 --> 00:00:09,564
mailbox.
It's a nuisance and all that paper adds 

5
00:00:11,281 --> 00:00:14,700
up to 26 million trees being cut down 
each year just for junk mail.

6
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:18,030
Most of it going to the landfill,
44 percent of it never even opened.

7
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:19,111
Also,
every day,

8
00:00:19,111 --> 00:00:23,460
$54 billion spam emails are sent at 
eight pieces of spam for every man,

9
00:00:23,461 --> 00:00:25,590
woman,
and child on earth per day.

10
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:26,593
You've got mail and also everyday 
telemarketers call 80 million people in 

11
00:00:30,061 --> 00:00:31,620
the U,
s with courtesy calls,

12
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:35,640
which is such a shamelessly ironic term 
that it has all been obliterated.

13
00:00:35,641 --> 00:00:36,474
The meaning of courtesy,
this is lead most people to not even 

14
00:00:38,281 --> 00:00:40,200
answer a number if it's not in their 
contact list,

15
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:41,753
and all of this just boils down to being
unknown to you and ultimately waste her 

16
00:00:44,941 --> 00:00:45,300
time.

17
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:46,133
Every second you have to spend during 
way mail sorting emails are screening 

18
00:00:48,601 --> 00:00:50,580
calls.
Luckily people like us,

19
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:51,443
I've already complained in the past and 
solutions had been created for these 

20
00:00:53,311 --> 00:00:54,144
problems.
The problem is they aren't very well 

21
00:00:55,531 --> 00:00:56,364
known or advertise,
so people aren't taking advantage of 

22
00:00:57,931 --> 00:01:00,690
them and we're about to change that junk
mail.

23
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:03,570
Two solutions,
first DMA choice.org.

24
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:04,613
The DMA is the largest direct marketing 
organization in the US and they send 

25
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:09,180
most of the junk mail that you get on 
this website.

26
00:01:09,181 --> 00:01:12,450
You can opt out from receiving junk mail
from any and all of their advertisers.

27
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:15,330
There's a $2 processing fee,
but it'll keep you off there.

28
00:01:15,331 --> 00:01:17,400
Do not contact mailing list for 10 
years,

29
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:19,020
so I think it's worth it.
Second,

30
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:20,700
opt out.
Prescreened.com.

31
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:21,833
It's a free service that puts you on a 
do not mail list for credit card and 

32
00:01:24,181 --> 00:01:25,740
insurance offers.
Okay.

33
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:26,633
Next spam email.
We're going to use DMA choice that org 

34
00:01:28,951 --> 00:01:29,784
for this.
Again,

35
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:30,713
on that same website,
you can also opt out from hearing from 

36
00:01:32,341 --> 00:01:35,700
any of their companies by email and this
will last six years and it's free.

37
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:38,160
Also,
make sure you have a gmail account which

38
00:01:38,161 --> 00:01:39,750
has a great spam filter.
Okay.

39
00:01:39,751 --> 00:01:42,090
Finally,
courtesy calls do not call.gov.

40
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:43,770
have you ever answered an unknown 
number?

41
00:01:43,771 --> 00:01:44,730
Just to hear this,

42
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:47,083
congratulations.
You've been selected to receive a free 

43
00:01:49,701 --> 00:01:50,840
cruise to the Bahamas.

44
00:01:51,050 --> 00:01:52,610
Well,
the Federal Trade Commission has started

45
00:01:52,611 --> 00:01:53,444
a do not call registry.
That makes it illegal for telemarketers 

46
00:01:55,341 --> 00:01:56,174
to do that to you.
It's free and it takes two minutes to 

47
00:01:57,771 --> 00:01:59,450
sign your number up.
It doesn't expire,

48
00:01:59,451 --> 00:02:03,170
so you never have to renew this and any 
telemarketer calling anyone on this list

49
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,320
will be fined up to $40,000.
All right,

50
00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:06,163
that's it.
You can knock all this out in less than 

51
00:02:07,041 --> 00:02:09,620
two minutes and it will save you a ton 
of time and headache in the future.

52
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:10,693
This has been a public service 
announcement from coffee break and you 

53
00:02:12,231 --> 00:02:13,310
guys have a great week.
