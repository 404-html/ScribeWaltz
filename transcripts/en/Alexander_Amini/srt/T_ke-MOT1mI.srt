1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:02,460
The value of art today is a slippery 
topic.

2
00:00:03,150 --> 00:00:03,983
Take a canvas out of the pump,
have an art gallery without the price 

3
00:00:05,851 --> 00:00:06,684
tag and many people would find it 
difficult to guess the price of the 

4
00:00:09,181 --> 00:00:10,014
piece,
like when banksy set up a street stand 

5
00:00:11,761 --> 00:00:15,540
for his art and almost no one noticed.
Let's see if you can do better.

6
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:18,200
Try to guess how much these pieces of 
art

7
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:19,093
cost.

8
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:40,020
It wasn't always this difficult before 
the 20th century,

9
00:00:40,021 --> 00:00:43,170
especially in Europe.
It was a more objective measure of art.

10
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:47,610
There was the hierarchy of genres 
codified by the European Academy of arts

11
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:51,060
with the highest genre holding more 
prestige and cultural value,

12
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:52,403
and in general,
a great artist was a master craftsman 

13
00:00:54,330 --> 00:00:58,800
and intellectual capable of capturing 
reality and recreating history,

14
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:01,140
and as you look up and down the 
hierarchy,

15
00:01:01,141 --> 00:01:04,530
it's clear that there's value given to 
what is difficult faces,

16
00:01:04,531 --> 00:01:06,240
which are the hardest to paint our 
weighted.

17
00:01:06,241 --> 00:01:10,740
The highest unmoving simple objects are 
the lowest and excluding moral waiting.

18
00:01:10,741 --> 00:01:12,840
I think this is a pretty intuitive 
valuation.

19
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:17,250
What is difficult is valuable.
All of this nicely agreed upon.

20
00:01:17,251 --> 00:01:22,251
Valuation was ruined by the dark room.
Now known as the camera Obscura,

21
00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:24,743
the name comes from an optical 
phenomenon where you can project an 

22
00:01:27,091 --> 00:01:29,700
image onto a back wall through a 
Pinhole,

23
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:30,863
but the image is very dim,
so you have to keep the room almost 

24
00:01:32,881 --> 00:01:33,714
totally dark to see it and pretty 
quickly many began realizing that with 

25
00:01:36,811 --> 00:01:38,190
film,
that is photosensitive.

26
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:41,550
They could use the dark room to capture 
moments forever.

27
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:42,533
It all happened quickly.
The first pictures were taken in the 

28
00:01:44,551 --> 00:01:47,310
early 19th century,
and by the end of that century,

29
00:01:47,311 --> 00:01:51,060
the Eastman Kodak Company was selling 
cameras with film for $1.

30
00:01:51,330 --> 00:01:54,840
This shook the very ground beneath 
artists feet.

31
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:57,900
Remember just before this,
before photographs,

32
00:01:58,230 --> 00:02:00,210
art was the only way of capturing a 
moment.

33
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,313
If you wanted to remember a view,
share some technical idea or even 

34
00:02:04,261 --> 00:02:06,510
commemorate your kingly face for 
posterity,

35
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:09,210
you'd need skill with a quill or the 
money to buy it,

36
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:10,463
but not anymore.
Reality can be claimed by anybody in a 

37
00:02:12,841 --> 00:02:13,674
bright flash that painted a moment with 
photon perfect accuracy with a higher 

38
00:02:16,741 --> 00:02:19,080
order of detailed than most painters 
could dream up.

39
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:21,960
Take a second.
What do you do as an artist?

40
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:25,050
What do you do when portraits,
life studies,

41
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:25,943
even landscapes can be memorialized 
without dragging out a pot of paint or 

42
00:02:29,641 --> 00:02:30,474
an easel that can be done cheaper and 
faster by any untrained buffoon who's 

43
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:34,793
got a buck?

44
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:38,960
What do you do?
Well,

45
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:39,863
for artists in the 20th century,
a wide scattering occurred with a burst 

46
00:02:43,291 --> 00:02:46,620
of art that mostly avoided realism,
cubism,

47
00:02:46,621 --> 00:02:48,270
fauvism,
post-impressionism,

48
00:02:48,271 --> 00:02:49,740
modernism,
surrealism.

49
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,640
There was tons of abstraction and work 
to define light,

50
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:55,500
to copy it.
Looking back,

51
00:02:55,530 --> 00:02:58,650
it's not surprising why when photography
burst into our hands,

52
00:02:58,750 --> 00:02:59,583
traditional meaning was lost for a lot 
of artists and found again with 

53
00:03:02,801 --> 00:03:03,634
completely different routes.
A lot of modern art is challenging the 

54
00:03:06,191 --> 00:03:09,250
very idea of objective value and meaning
art.

55
00:03:09,251 --> 00:03:12,250
Today,
modern art doesn't carry an objective or

56
00:03:12,251 --> 00:03:16,390
generally agreed upon value because they
lost that along time ago.

57
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:20,410
Instead,
the value of art is entirely subjective.

58
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:23,350
Whatever you think that piece is worth 
is what it's worth,

59
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:27,790
and this means that for many who strike 
up the intuitive and historical position

60
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:30,100
that art value should be related to 
difficulty.

61
00:03:30,490 --> 00:03:31,323
There's a paradigm sized gap between 
them and the artist's prices and we 

62
00:03:36,101 --> 00:03:40,450
would do well to observe the cultural 
shift here in art and other places where

63
00:03:40,490 --> 00:03:41,323
technology has made something easy or 
automated because the birth of the dark 

64
00:03:44,861 --> 00:03:45,694
room and the way it shaped art history 
gives us insights into how our modern 

65
00:03:49,661 --> 00:03:50,494
world and definitions of value might 
react to the upending of human 

66
00:03:53,831 --> 00:03:54,664
difficulty.

67
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:01,660
I want to be a force for real good.
In other words,

68
00:04:01,661 --> 00:04:02,494
I know that there are bad forces forces 
that bring suffering to others and 

69
00:04:05,351 --> 00:04:09,220
misery to the world,
but I want to be the opposite force.

70
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:13,390
I want to be the force which is truly 
for good.

00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:30,880

As I'm sure you heard.

75
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:45,010
Finally got some exciting news.
I'm releasing a new line of experimental

76
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:47,050
artist.
It's actually only one piece of art.

77
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:49,810
Just one of one.
I think you'll like it.
