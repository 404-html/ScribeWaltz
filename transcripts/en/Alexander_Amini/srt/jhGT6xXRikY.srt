The Irish contestants,
Aleksandra Amini is an avid tennis 

2
00:00:05,851 --> 00:00:06,684
player.
He hasn't been to the software that 

3
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:09,233
analyzes tennis trucks and gives details
feedback to athletes so that they can 

4
00:00:12,511 --> 00:00:15,510
improve their performance.
No,

5
00:00:15,530 --> 00:00:16,363
my.
My Algorithm is monitoring the initial 

6
00:00:18,511 --> 00:00:21,240
data from the center until I had a 
stroke.

7
00:00:21,241 --> 00:00:23,730
I will,
once I hit the stroke,

8
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:24,593
it will protect the stroke and then try 
and process each of the possible stroke 

9
00:00:27,271 --> 00:00:30,710
types I could have possibly been hit 
once a stroke is a process.

10
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:31,573
This process by its provided back to the
athlete by feedback and also a precise 

11
00:00:36,961 --> 00:00:37,794
and unbiased feedback is provided based 
on small deviations that were performed 

12
00:00:41,290 --> 00:00:44,520
and that could be used to improve the 
stroke for the next time.

13
00:00:44,521 --> 00:00:45,354
That was it.
