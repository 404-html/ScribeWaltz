1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:02,460
Why don't more people care about my 
thing.

2
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:06,390
It's unbelievable the way the rest of 
you just blissfully live your lives,

3
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:08,580
unconcerned with the real issues of this
world.

4
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:11,190
After all,
take any aspect of your life.

5
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:14,250
My group would agree that my thing is 
the most pressing thing about it.

6
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:16,860
Don't you all realize how serious this 
is?

7
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:18,263
I mean,
let's not even talk about people with a 

8
00:00:19,231 --> 00:00:20,064
different opinion of my thing.
The fact that they don't agree with my 

9
00:00:22,021 --> 00:00:24,300
fax means that they're willfully 
ignoring the facts.

10
00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:25,920
No,
I'm talking to you.

11
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:30,180
The one with no dog in this fight.
Really your the one to blame here.

12
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:32,670
You keep talking about your thing and 
going on about that,

13
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:35,790
but you have to realize by not taking 
action on my thing,

14
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:36,893
you're perpetuating the problem in 
action is action and you've done quite 

15
00:00:40,351 --> 00:00:43,380
enough for ready,
I guess silly me for thinking that other

16
00:00:43,381 --> 00:00:47,250
people would actually be logical and 
reasonable for a change and realize that

17
00:00:47,251 --> 00:00:49,860
my thing should be as important to them 
as it is to me.

18
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:51,083
It just breaks my heart.
Why don't more people care about my 

19
00:00:53,161 --> 00:00:53,994
thing?

20
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:02,083
Okay.
