Hi Guys.
It's been awhile.

2
00:00:01,590 --> 00:00:02,423
I've been swamped with work as well as 
putting together one of my largest 

3
00:00:04,321 --> 00:00:05,420
videos ever.
Sorry.

4
00:00:05,421 --> 00:00:07,290
I hope you all bear with me while I get 
that finished.

5
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:08,453
In the gap of uploads though,
I really wanted to tell you about some 

6
00:00:10,381 --> 00:00:11,850
awesome things that I thought couldn't 
wait.

7
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:16,890
The biggest thing is that we hit 100,000
subscribers late February,

8
00:00:16,891 --> 00:00:21,300
which is absolutely amazing.
The same time last February,

9
00:00:21,301 --> 00:00:24,240
I had set some goals for this channel 
and of all of them,

10
00:00:24,241 --> 00:00:26,640
the most ambitious of them was to get to
50,000

11
00:00:26,641 --> 00:00:30,150
subs in one year.
To really understand how crazy that goal

12
00:00:30,151 --> 00:00:30,984
was to me at the time.
First you have to know that I had a 

13
00:00:32,521 --> 00:00:37,320
youtube channel before this making piano
videos and it took me 80 videos over two

14
00:00:37,321 --> 00:00:38,154
years to get 100 subscribers,
so zero to 50 K in one year was pretty 

15
00:00:42,481 --> 00:00:43,314
much shooting for the moon and even by 
last July I only had 300 subscribers on 

16
00:00:47,221 --> 00:00:48,054
this channel.

17
00:00:48,330 --> 00:00:50,370
So I had thought that goal was dead in 
the water,

18
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:53,010
but thanks to you all who watch these 
videos and shared them,

19
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:55,500
we not only hit that goal,
we doubled it.

20
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:00,540
You all made that amazing goal possible.
So thank you.

21
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:04,020
Now I think the question is now that we 
have all these people here,

22
00:01:04,021 --> 00:01:06,300
what are we going to do to make this 
channel even better?

23
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:09,660
Well first we got our subreddit r slash 
coffee break.

24
00:01:09,661 --> 00:01:12,780
One word started on reddit.
We don't have many people there yet,

25
00:01:12,781 --> 00:01:15,960
but that's about to change and it's 
going to eventually become a big part of

26
00:01:15,961 --> 00:01:18,000
this community.
We already have a discord,

27
00:01:18,001 --> 00:01:18,834
which is more like a chat room,
but reddit superior comment sorting 

28
00:01:20,791 --> 00:01:21,624
makes it better for group discussion.
So why don't you guys to go subscribe 

29
00:01:23,881 --> 00:01:24,714
over there.
It's going to be a great place to meet 

30
00:01:25,501 --> 00:01:28,050
like minded people and discuss videos 
and ideas.

31
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:29,003
It will also be a place for future 
announcements such as the one in this 

32
00:01:31,171 --> 00:01:32,790
video.
Secondly,

33
00:01:32,791 --> 00:01:33,624
I wanted to tell you that I do a lot of 
research for these videos and I want to 

34
00:01:35,761 --> 00:01:38,850
make that more visible going forward.
So I'm going to be putting more and more

35
00:01:38,851 --> 00:01:41,100
effort into getting good footnotes for 
these videos.

36
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:43,410
If you want to learn more about the 
subjects I talk about.

37
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:46,110
The third thing I can't talk too much 
about yet,

38
00:01:46,111 --> 00:01:48,810
but I plan on focusing more on coffee 
break soon.

39
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:51,480
If you look at my backlog,
I used to upload once a week,

40
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:52,763
but that had slowed down because of work
related stuff that's going to change 

41
00:01:55,381 --> 00:01:56,214
come April or May and we're going to try
to ramp back up to a more frequent 

42
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:01,140
uploads schedule.
And finally,

43
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,033
as part of the 100 k celebration,
I decided to take this moment to 

44
00:02:04,831 --> 00:02:07,170
highlight the lesser known people behind
the show,

45
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,990
the musicians whose music I feature on 
the channel.

46
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:11,103
Music has always been huge for this 
channel and I'm sure it's part of the 

47
00:02:12,961 --> 00:02:14,580
reason a lot of you like listening to 
me.

48
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:15,773
So I'm going to be uploading a best of 
coffee break music mix right after this 

49
00:02:18,151 --> 00:02:21,720
video to essentially throw a spotlight 
on just how talented these people are.

50
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,850
I'm uploading it separately from this 
video,

51
00:02:23,851 --> 00:02:26,340
so if you guys want to just put it on 
his study music or whatever,

52
00:02:26,341 --> 00:02:28,890
you don't have to listen to my annoying 
preamble every time,

53
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:32,070
but if I could just ask of you,
when you go to listen to the music mix,

54
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:32,933
if you like one of the songs,
please go check out the artist's actual 

55
00:02:35,341 --> 00:02:37,950
page and comment telling them you came 
from coffee break.

56
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:40,560
All the artists they feature on here are
incredible,

57
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:43,050
and the songs I show only scratched the 
surface.

58
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:44,610
All right?
That's pretty much it.

59
00:02:44,611 --> 00:02:45,444
To recap,
reddit more videos around April and May 

60
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,860
and go check out some of those amazing 
artists.

61
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:52,500
I feel so blessed to reach a hundred k 
subs in one year,

62
00:02:52,501 --> 00:02:54,480
and I'm looking forward to where we go 
from here.

63
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:56,100
Thank you for watching.
