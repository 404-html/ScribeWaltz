1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:03,780
I can't believe I'm saying this,
but youtube has gotten stale lately.

2
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:06,090
Youtube used to be the place to go to 
find cool,

3
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:10,770
obscure videos by independent niche 
craters like this or this.

4
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:15,810
It was basically the antithesis of cable
tv where everything is sanitized and you

5
00:00:15,811 --> 00:00:16,644
know exactly what you're wanting to get.
Youtube used to have an effect that I'd 

6
00:00:18,991 --> 00:00:19,824
like to call it,
they do to black hole where you get on 

7
00:00:21,010 --> 00:00:21,843
to see a retina link video and find 
yourself three hours later watching 

8
00:00:23,851 --> 00:00:24,684
windsurfing fails compilation number 
seven or the ultimate showdown of 

9
00:00:27,631 --> 00:00:28,464
ultimate destiny.
All through just clicking on related 

10
00:00:30,211 --> 00:00:31,044
videos in the sidebar is a bit like 
going down the rabbit hole in Alice in 

11
00:00:33,421 --> 00:00:34,254
wonderland,
but youtube has made it harder to have 

12
00:00:35,161 --> 00:00:37,020
this experience or finding fresh 
content.

13
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:37,913
This is a screen capture of when I 
recently went to watch you Rhett and 

14
00:00:39,601 --> 00:00:40,710
link video on this channel.

15
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:41,633
Look at the sidebar options,
which should be the primary way to find 

16
00:00:43,471 --> 00:00:44,304
new channels.
The first page full is all written link 

17
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:47,633
and the few options that are different 
at the very bottom are channels that I 

18
00:00:50,551 --> 00:00:51,384
already have subscribed to.
There's absolutely nothing new to find 

19
00:00:53,581 --> 00:00:55,470
here.
How did this happen?

20
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:57,660
Well,
I did some digging and it has to do with

21
00:00:57,661 --> 00:00:58,494
the Youtube Algorithm.
That's what determines what results or 

22
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:01,710
favorite show up when you search 
something.

23
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:03,870
It's exact inner workings are more 
precious.

24
00:01:03,871 --> 00:01:05,550
That garden,
the Krabby Patty formula,

25
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:08,250
but people have been able to figure out 
pretty much how it works.

26
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:09,443
A few years ago,
youtube changes formula to favor watch 

27
00:01:11,191 --> 00:01:12,420
time.
In other words,

28
00:01:12,421 --> 00:01:15,060
they'd rather show you a video that will
keep you on their site for 30 minutes.

29
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:15,923
Then one that will keep you on for 10 
minutes and that makes sense business 

30
00:01:18,211 --> 00:01:19,044
wise,
but it's also why it's so hard to find 

31
00:01:19,981 --> 00:01:21,060
new channels on youtube.

32
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:21,953
Basically it comes down to this.
Youtube wants to suggest videos that it 

33
00:01:24,541 --> 00:01:25,374
knows you're already likely to enjoy,
but the only thing it knows that you 

34
00:01:27,931 --> 00:01:29,460
already liked is what you've already 
watched.

35
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:30,713
This means it's only going to feed you 
more of the creators you already know 

36
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,193
and look,
I'm fine with being shown more about 

37
00:01:34,981 --> 00:01:35,814
subjects that I watch,
but it seems like lately that's all 

38
00:01:37,651 --> 00:01:41,820
youtube will recommend.
We need a new way to discover videos and

39
00:01:41,821 --> 00:01:44,340
if any of you suggest the trending tab,
I'll put you through that wall.

40
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:45,703
It's just a bunch of TV,
late night host movie trailers or other 

41
00:01:47,491 --> 00:01:48,324
mass appeal videos.
I don't need help finding the youtubers 

42
00:01:51,481 --> 00:01:53,310
I already watched.
I know who they are.

43
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,860
I want to be able to find new creators 
I've never heard of.

44
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:58,110
That's what made the youtube experience 
special.

45
00:01:58,590 --> 00:01:59,423
But Youtube needs to change its 
algorithm to take more risks with 

46
00:02:01,261 --> 00:02:02,094
suggestions or we're going to all get 
tired of watching more of the same 

47
00:02:04,351 --> 00:02:06,420
content he always watched.
In summary,

48
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:07,283
youtube,
you're getting boring these days and 

49
00:02:08,701 --> 00:02:12,450
it's time to spice things up.
Yours conditionally theaudience.

50
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:13,713
Hey,
what's up guys,

51
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:15,580
thanks for watching that video.
Um,

52
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:18,040
and you know,
I think the best video,

53
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:20,230
not the video that you found that you 
were looking for,

54
00:02:20,231 --> 00:02:22,030
but the one that you found that you 
weren't looking for,

55
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:22,883
they're just right.
So if you guys have had an experience 

56
00:02:25,871 --> 00:02:27,490
like that,
reasonably let me know.

57
00:02:27,491 --> 00:02:28,540
If you haven't,
let me know.

58
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:30,280
Thanks for watching.
