1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:01,103
There is no place where advertising is 
more relevant than in the cigarette 

2
00:00:04,771 --> 00:00:07,590
industry.
Brand loyalty is extremely high,

3
00:00:07,591 --> 00:00:08,424
so it's important to a cigarette company
that they're the first ones that you 

4
00:00:10,561 --> 00:00:11,394
smoke.
It's also important to distract the 

5
00:00:13,021 --> 00:00:13,854
customer from the obvious fallacy and 
bargain that their product will 

6
00:00:15,991 --> 00:00:16,824
eventually kill you.
Necessity has made these companies 

7
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:24,390
masters at advertising and until 1970 
when cigarette advertisements were band,

8
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:27,240
nobody was better at this advertising 
than Marlboro.

9
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:30,600
Cigarette or packaging is more 
recognizable,

10
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:33,570
more American,
more smoke than this one,

11
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:37,740
but Marlboro did more than just when the
advertising more with their rivals.

12
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:41,610
They changed advertising forever and how
did they do it?

13
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:42,473
Well,
when Philip Morris started the company 

14
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:44,820
in 18,
47,

15
00:00:44,821 --> 00:00:47,760
it was aimed at women.
It didn't work very well at first.

16
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:48,953
However,
in the 19 fifties when new studies came 

17
00:00:50,371 --> 00:00:51,204
out that smoking caused cancer,
many tobacco companies started to panic 

18
00:00:53,431 --> 00:00:54,450
and change tactics.

19
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:56,970
It was at this point that Marlboro made 
a key.

20
00:00:57,570 --> 00:00:58,403
They switched their advertising tactic 
to men and became the first ever 

21
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:03,790
lifestyle advertisers.
Okay.

22
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:06,940
Pause.
Before we go further.

23
00:01:06,970 --> 00:01:10,220
It's very important that you know 
exactly what lifestyle advertising looks

24
00:01:10,221 --> 00:01:11,054
like.
The good news is you're already super 

25
00:01:12,911 --> 00:01:15,310
familiar with lifestyle advertising.
Even if you don't know it.

26
00:01:15,970 --> 00:01:19,450
It is when a commercial tries to tie its
product to something else in your life,

27
00:01:19,810 --> 00:01:20,643
a feeling and attribute satisfaction.
The list is endless like when an energy 

28
00:01:23,621 --> 00:01:26,960
drink ties itself to extreme athleticism
or a camera adventure,

29
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:31,250
a soda to happiness,
a car to love,

30
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,750
or a phone to more than just a phone.
Once you're familiar with the term,

31
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:36,673
you'll notice it.
The most popular and effective form of 

32
00:01:38,091 --> 00:01:41,480
advertising that we know of,
but it wasn't always this way.

33
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:42,613
Roll the clock back 60 years and people 
had a much different idea of how to 

34
00:01:45,351 --> 00:01:46,184
advertise your product.
Take a look at this camel ad from the 

35
00:01:48,831 --> 00:01:49,664
fifties

36
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:54,280
are mild kind of cigarette smoking camel
for 20 years.

37
00:01:55,810 --> 00:01:57,820
I know that mild and they really taste 
great.

38
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:00,340
Yes,
cameras are so mild,

39
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:04,270
that unattached of hundreds of people 
who smoked all my camels for 30 days.

40
00:02:04,570 --> 00:02:05,403
Throat specialists making weekly 
examinations reported not one single 

41
00:02:08,591 --> 00:02:11,440
case of throat irritation due to smoking
camels.

42
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:14,700
Why is this ad so unconvincing?
Well,

43
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:19,170
everything is fact and product oriented 
by my thing over there thing because all

44
00:02:19,171 --> 00:02:20,004
our researchers say so,
but the truth is most of us don't care 

45
00:02:21,961 --> 00:02:22,794
about that research.
I'm buying a pack of cigarettes to be 

46
00:02:24,571 --> 00:02:26,060
cool,
not because Dr.

47
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:30,930
say it's more smooth than a competitors.
So in the fifties on road changed sexes,

48
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:31,853
they also changed their advertising 
strategy by selling their product as a 

49
00:02:34,651 --> 00:02:37,560
symbol rather than just on the merits of
its design.

50
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:41,070
They did this by creating a smoking 
cowboy,

51
00:02:41,071 --> 00:02:41,904
known Nathan Marlboro.
The Marlboro man was designed to be the 

52
00:02:44,401 --> 00:02:47,580
archetype of manliness.
He was hard working and living free.

53
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:49,163
So with that last commercial in mind,
watch this commercial and notice how 

54
00:02:52,021 --> 00:02:52,854
much less screen time devolver oh gets 
and how the focus of the ad has shifted 

55
00:02:56,401 --> 00:03:00,360
away from an isolated product to 
encompass a feeling upper rough,

56
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,510
rugged,
free life.

57
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:04,840
In other words,
they weren't just selling cigarettes,

58
00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:07,060
but rather a feeling of freedom and 
adventure.

59
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:08,703
And there's maybe a slight irony here 
that most cowboys did not smoke at this 

60
00:03:11,651 --> 00:03:12,730
time,
but instead dip.

61
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:16,540
But most people didn't care.
Within one year of this campaign,

62
00:03:16,541 --> 00:03:17,374
Marlboro went from owning less than one 
percent of the market to being the 

63
00:03:19,571 --> 00:03:21,400
fourth largest cigarette company in the 
world.

64
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:22,713
And within four more years it became the
number one selling cigarette in the 

65
00:03:24,911 --> 00:03:26,320
world.
And it remains that way.

66
00:03:26,321 --> 00:03:27,154
To this day,
the Marlboro man is a legend in 

67
00:03:29,111 --> 00:03:31,570
advertising and shape the future of 
advertising forever.

68
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:34,030
And I think no matter what your stance 
on cigarettes are,

69
00:03:34,031 --> 00:03:37,360
we can all learn from our lessons to 
help us communicate with others.

70
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:38,553
People don't want to be sold a product.
People want to be sort of feeling a 

71
00:03:41,411 --> 00:03:42,244
connection,
something that's worth more than the 

72
00:03:43,901 --> 00:03:48,901
paper that it's printed on.
So it's in the spirit of learning that I

73
00:03:50,291 --> 00:03:51,124
decided to change my subscribers segment
for this video to be a little more 

74
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,250
lifestyle oriented.
