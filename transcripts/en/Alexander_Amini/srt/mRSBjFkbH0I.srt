1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,940
You and I both know that the title of 
this video is a lie.

2
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:05,490
I'm never going to delete it,
but nonetheless,

3
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:07,620
you clicked on it.
On the odd chance I do delete it.

4
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:08,513
You get to be part of the lucky few that
gets to see this video before it 

5
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:11,543
disappears into the void,
and that's what we're going to talk 

6
00:00:13,621 --> 00:00:14,454
about today.
That feeling of scarcity and 

7
00:00:15,781 --> 00:00:19,320
specifically how people market to that 
scarcity to make you look at things,

8
00:00:19,321 --> 00:00:20,154
want things and buy things.
Have you ever noticed how much 

9
00:00:23,011 --> 00:00:25,440
advertisers talk about limits and 
urgency?

10
00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:30,720
We live the thrill of beating the clock.
Any sized soft drinks for a dollar won't

11
00:00:30,721 --> 00:00:32,010
stick around long.
Buy One,

12
00:00:32,011 --> 00:00:34,800
get one free this Friday and Saturday,
only October.

13
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:37,890
Hurry in now to October savings end 
soon.

14
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:40,950
Now,
why do advertisers do this?

15
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:43,590
Some of you may feel that this is merely
incidental.

16
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:45,300
All good things come to an end after 
all,

17
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:46,613
but that isn't quite true.
Companies deliberately want to send you 

18
00:00:49,141 --> 00:00:49,974
the message that this,
this incredible deal won't be here for 

19
00:00:52,381 --> 00:00:53,214
long because the reason we want things,
the reason we buy things often has very 

20
00:00:56,521 --> 00:00:57,354
little to do with the product and 
everything to do with how the ad makes 

21
00:00:59,671 --> 00:01:00,504
us feel and selling.
Scarcity is all about making you and I 

22
00:01:03,331 --> 00:01:04,164
feel like we've been given opportunity.
Opportunity is not the same as being 

23
00:01:07,651 --> 00:01:10,230
given a choice.
Opportunity is a choice,

24
00:01:10,231 --> 00:01:13,470
but it has a special component.
It's a time bound choice.

25
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:16,380
It has to be seized.
It won't be there for long.

26
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:17,453
It forces action.
You can have this product at this 

27
00:01:19,651 --> 00:01:22,380
specially discounted rate,
but the deal ends this weekend.

28
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:23,483
It forces you to say yes or no to a deal
because inaction is a choice and it may 

29
00:01:29,341 --> 00:01:30,174
surprise you,
but this is different from our normal 

30
00:01:31,381 --> 00:01:33,210
behavior.
Think about when you're in a store.

31
00:01:33,211 --> 00:01:35,880
Normally.
Usually when you pass up on a product,

32
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:36,923
you're not actually saying no to it.
You're just saying maybe later we do 

33
00:01:40,201 --> 00:01:41,034
this all the time.
We're procrastinators by nature and if 

34
00:01:43,381 --> 00:01:44,214
allowed will shop around for awhile 
because the implication with most goods 

35
00:01:47,131 --> 00:01:50,460
and services is that they're going to 
still be there when you come back,

36
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:53,580
but with limited time or limited 
quantity sales,

37
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:57,300
the goal is to remove the option of 
saying maybe a later to an object.

38
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:58,433
He'd forces action,
say yes and buy it or say no and kiss 

39
00:02:01,141 --> 00:02:06,120
this deal goodbye forever and this is a 
fundamental change and can push you from

40
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:06,983
uncertainty to buying a product out of 
fear that it will be gone if you come 

41
00:02:10,081 --> 00:02:13,830
back later and just how effective is 
this form of marketing?

42
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,810
Well,
let's look at Amazon,

43
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,480
the largest distributor in store in the 
world.

44
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:22,350
What does the most successful store do 
you when it puts on huge sales,

45
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,610
it put scarcity marketing to work and 
from two different angles.

46
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:29,970
Look at this.
This is not only a limited time sale and

47
00:02:29,971 --> 00:02:33,600
it's not only a limited quantity sale,
it's both and when it's done,

48
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:34,463
it's done.
This one little web widget that tracks 

49
00:02:37,081 --> 00:02:37,914
how much of the product has moved and 
tracks how much time has passed moves 

50
00:02:41,041 --> 00:02:43,770
product like crazy.
Take for instance,

51
00:02:43,771 --> 00:02:47,370
this seller who during a four hour 
lightning sales sold over 6,000

52
00:02:47,371 --> 00:02:51,150
units when they normally would have sold
four to $500 in a given day.

53
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:52,343
That's a 1300 percent increase in sales 
for taking 20 percent off the price and 

54
00:02:55,591 --> 00:02:58,830
putting it on the lightning page or to 
put that in business.

55
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:03,250
So what does consumer psychology have to
say about this?

56
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:04,413
Well,
there's react in theory and there's 

57
00:03:05,411 --> 00:03:06,244
commodity react.
In theory developed by Jack Brown says 

58
00:03:09,161 --> 00:03:09,994
that when an individual's freedom to 
engage in a specific behavior is 

59
00:03:12,641 --> 00:03:13,474
threatened,
the threatened behavior becomes more 

60
00:03:15,401 --> 00:03:16,960
attractive.
This is why,

61
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:17,823
for instance,
when politicians mentioned gun control 

62
00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:20,883
ammunition flies off the shelves because
gun owners are worried about their 

63
00:03:23,351 --> 00:03:24,184
future ability to buy it.
It's also why this video title is so 

64
00:03:26,711 --> 00:03:29,320
provocative because I'm threatening to 
take it away from you.

65
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:32,950
The other theory we're going to explore 
is commodity theory.

66
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:37,180
This idea developed by brock and fromkin
suggests that goods which appeared to be

67
00:03:37,181 --> 00:03:39,610
scarce are considered to be more 
valuable.

68
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:43,630
This is the idea behind diamonds which 
are actually not rare at all,

69
00:03:43,631 --> 00:03:44,464
but due to a very tightly controlled 
supply have artificially sustain the 

70
00:03:47,381 --> 00:03:48,214
high price point.
So when marketing companies tell you 

71
00:03:50,231 --> 00:03:51,420
that something isn't,
soon,

72
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:52,393
they're trying to artificially restrict 
the supply to raise the value in your 

73
00:03:55,691 --> 00:03:56,620
mind.
Now,

74
00:03:56,621 --> 00:03:57,454
I think a mixture of both of these 
theories come into play in shaping how 

75
00:03:59,741 --> 00:04:02,380
we respond to perceived scarcity,
but either way,

76
00:04:02,381 --> 00:04:03,110
scarcity

77
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:07,070
plays on our ancient impulses to take 
advantage of limited resources.

78
00:04:08,770 --> 00:04:12,890
And this idea hits particularly close to
home for me because as some of you know,

79
00:04:12,891 --> 00:04:13,724
I work a sales job selling houses as my 
main nine to five job and when we run 

80
00:04:17,331 --> 00:04:18,164
promotionals,
we do it to generate this exact kind of 

81
00:04:20,211 --> 00:04:21,044
feeling I've been talking about.
Because when people want to take their 

82
00:04:23,691 --> 00:04:24,524
time and mull over a decision,
it can lead them to buying nothing at 

83
00:04:27,081 --> 00:04:29,210
all.
So to get a positional advantage,

84
00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:33,170
we run promos periodically to get the 
leverage to say enough thinking.

85
00:04:33,171 --> 00:04:35,360
It's time to make a decision.
I mean,

86
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:37,280
you do want to take advantage of this 
big sale,

87
00:04:37,281 --> 00:04:39,320
don't you?
In reality,

88
00:04:39,321 --> 00:04:42,560
is there any reason the house houses 
should be less expensive that month?

89
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:43,753
No,
but we want people to think there is 

90
00:04:45,501 --> 00:04:46,334
because it creates urgency.
Our reaction to scarcity is a powerful 

91
00:04:50,361 --> 00:04:51,194
force in advertising and marketing.
It plays on one of our most fundamental 

92
00:04:54,351 --> 00:04:56,840
instincts to not miss out on 
opportunity,

93
00:04:57,170 --> 00:04:58,003
and this bias is exploited constantly by
businesses who use advertising and 

94
00:05:01,041 --> 00:05:03,770
marketing tactics to create artificial 
scarcity.

95
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:07,610
So just as a rule of thumb,
if you live in a developed country where

96
00:05:07,611 --> 00:05:10,130
abundance is the norm,
rather than the exception,

97
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:11,143
you can begin to safely make the 
assumption that if someone is telling 

98
00:05:13,461 --> 00:05:14,294
you supplies are low,
they're probably trying to sell you 

99
00:05:16,491 --> 00:05:17,324
something.
