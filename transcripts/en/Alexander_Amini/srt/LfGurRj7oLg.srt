00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:02,700
There are two ways to use music as the 
foreground itself,

2
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:03,563
an object of attention or as the 
background that contextualizes the rest 

3
00:00:06,211 --> 00:00:09,360
of your world.
Instrumental music often falls into that

4
00:00:09,361 --> 00:00:11,430
latter category.
Humble and unassuming.

5
00:00:11,431 --> 00:00:12,264
Most people overlook this kind of music 
in favor of music that has a direct 

6
00:00:14,911 --> 00:00:16,170
message.
In fact,

7
00:00:16,171 --> 00:00:17,004
instrumental music almost never comes up
on the charts and the same way that 

8
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:20,033
songs,
it just doesn't capture people's 

9
00:00:21,121 --> 00:00:24,810
attention in the same way and I think 
that's because many people misunderstand

10
00:00:24,811 --> 00:00:25,644
the role of instrumental music.
We often listen to instrumentals as we 

11
00:00:28,231 --> 00:00:31,800
would a song and that's a mistake.
When we listened to songs,

12
00:00:31,801 --> 00:00:32,634
our mind is automatically parsing it for
meaning for understanding of the 

13
00:00:34,951 --> 00:00:35,784
songwriters message.
And if you do that with an instrumental 

14
00:00:37,591 --> 00:00:39,810
piece,
you'll be sorely disappointed because in

15
00:00:39,811 --> 00:00:42,330
an instrumental meaning and message 
aren't explicit.

16
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:45,840
That's left up to you and I want to 
examine this difference through the song

17
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:46,793
entitled five by Kendrick Lamar because 
there's a significant portion of the 

18
00:00:49,711 --> 00:00:52,410
song that is an instrumental before 
Kendrick comes into rap,

19
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:55,770
and this perfectly illustrates what is 
gained and lost when explicit meaning is

20
00:00:55,790 --> 00:00:57,710
given.
In the beginning of this piece,

21
00:00:57,711 --> 00:00:58,670
we hear a jazz camp

22
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:11,520
on his own.
We may call to mind a friend,

23
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:13,740
a sunny day,
the smell of espresso,

24
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:16,650
a hipster coffee shop.
We are free to give meaning,

25
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:17,963
but this vanishes when Kendrick comes 
into rap because he begins to tell a 

26
00:01:20,431 --> 00:01:22,140
story.
I got 100 no,

27
00:01:22,141 --> 00:01:27,141
my dad's name in the grab bag in the 
trunk.

28
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:30,900
So even though we gained something,
when Kendrick comes in a clever story,

29
00:01:30,901 --> 00:01:32,740
different viewpoints,
we also lose something.

30
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:36,030
Whatever meeting to song could have 
helped to us after it's intended.

31
00:01:36,031 --> 00:01:36,864
Meaning is explicitly told.
Now of course there's always room for 

32
00:01:40,021 --> 00:01:43,530
some interpretation songs,
but our interpretation has been limited.

33
00:01:44,010 --> 00:01:46,590
You're no longer in a coffee shop.
You're in Kendrick's car.

34
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:50,210
It's not a sunny day.
It's raining God on the engine.

35
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:51,053
This fed off in the brain,
and this is how Kendrick Lamar can help 

36
00:01:56,221 --> 00:01:59,790
us understand instrumentals through what
we lose when he starts rapping,

37
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:03,150
we lose focus on our own world,
which is replaced with his,

38
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:07,020
and there's nothing wrong with that.
I myself love getting lost in Kendrick's

39
00:02:07,021 --> 00:02:07,854
vivid world.
But if you understand this difference 

40
00:02:09,271 --> 00:02:10,104
between songs and instrumentals,
you may find the instrumentals can fill 

41
00:02:12,301 --> 00:02:13,134
a gap.
That song's camp songs for most people 

42
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:16,013
are too distracting for studying,
having a conversation with someone or 

43
00:02:18,331 --> 00:02:20,610
reading a book because they say too 
much.

44
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,490
But instrumentals perfectly.
Lay a mood without trudy.

45
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:25,103
So assuming you don't already tried 
turning on an instrumental for a change 

46
00:02:27,661 --> 00:02:31,380
and see how it affects you differently,
construct your own meaning and message.

47
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,393
Hey,
thanks for watching this video as a 

48
00:02:36,301 --> 00:02:37,134
help.
To those of you who aren't big 

49
00:02:37,531 --> 00:02:39,360
instrumental heads,
I'm going to include a bunch of links.

50
00:02:39,361 --> 00:02:41,880
So the description that may help you 
find an artist you like,

51
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:44,220
and those of you who are ready,
listen to instrumentals,

52
00:02:44,221 --> 00:02:46,800
comment below with your favorite 
instrumentals that others might not have

53
00:02:46,801 --> 00:02:48,570
heard of before.
Who are you listening to?
