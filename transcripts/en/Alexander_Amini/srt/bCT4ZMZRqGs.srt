1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:03,520
Last year's winner was Alexandra 
[inaudible] from Dublin.

2
00:00:03,730 --> 00:00:04,563
He was 15 when he won the competition 
with his work on tennis sensor data 

3
00:00:08,771 --> 00:00:10,870
analysis.
But it didn't stop there.

4
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:13,180
I was doing a,
Sullivan has been finding out

5
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:24,803
seating at the bt young scientists 
competition is all about hard work and 

6
00:00:28,741 --> 00:00:32,310
no one exemplifies this more.
And last year's winner Alexander,

7
00:00:32,311 --> 00:00:35,010
I'm Mimi,
he arrived in Ireland from New York,

8
00:00:35,011 --> 00:00:35,844
but he's found he just two years ago 
quickly set his sights on the 

9
00:00:38,791 --> 00:00:39,624
competition.

10
00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:45,570
It was a really something that came to 
me like overnight because uh,

11
00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:50,790
I play a lot of tennis and it was just 
the idea of trying to create a system to

12
00:00:51,071 --> 00:00:54,220
help tennis players because coaching can
be so expensive.

13
00:00:54,221 --> 00:00:57,940
It's something that is a such a luxury 
for tennis athletes.

14
00:00:57,941 --> 00:01:02,320
So to have something like a program that
can provide real time feedback,

15
00:01:02,710 --> 00:01:03,543
unbiased feedback to an athlete in real 
time is just a necessity for every time 

16
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:08,373
I sit down.

17
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:12,400
Alexander has been playing from a very 
early age,

18
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:16,840
so it probably wasn't surprising he 
chose to incorporate in this project.

19
00:01:19,570 --> 00:01:21,680
Um,
my whole family faced this actually.

20
00:01:21,770 --> 00:01:25,430
So I have two sisters and one brother.
We all play tennis.

21
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:27,560
My Dad started us,
uh,

22
00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:30,140
to play tennis and he's been all of our 
coach.

23
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:33,713
Uh,
so my project is just a motion 

24
00:01:35,371 --> 00:01:36,204
refinement and recognition system.
So I turned my projects for tennis and 

25
00:01:39,711 --> 00:01:40,544
specific.
But what it does is just recognized as 

26
00:01:42,781 --> 00:01:43,614
the type of motions that a athlete or a 
person is performing and then tries to 

27
00:01:46,891 --> 00:01:48,990
provide feedback on how to improve these
motions.

28
00:01:50,290 --> 00:01:55,030
Alexandre use the facilities here at 
tennis Ireland in Dcu for his project as

29
00:01:55,031 --> 00:01:55,864
their courts can be filmed from several 
different angles from cameras located 

30
00:01:58,840 --> 00:01:59,673
high on the walls.
Alexandra use the raw data from tennis 

31
00:02:02,861 --> 00:02:03,694
sessions,
played here to write his own computer 

32
00:02:05,471 --> 00:02:06,304
program which can interpret how good 
your tennis swing is from the signal 

33
00:02:09,431 --> 00:02:12,040
sent from a motion sensor worn on the 
wrist.

34
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:17,410
He used 13 different computer languages 
to write the software and unsurprisingly

35
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:18,910
wild the judges,

36
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:21,920
the bt young scientists and 
technologists.

37
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:23,630
I'll the year 2011

38
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:25,270
is it

39
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:26,103
Alexander?

40
00:02:30,290 --> 00:02:31,123
This I have to say is well,
the best ones we've ever seen at a 

41
00:02:34,251 --> 00:02:38,260
working level in terms of research.
This is an excellent project compared to

42
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:39,213
a an honors undergraduate degree level 
or even postgraduate degree level 

43
00:02:42,701 --> 00:02:44,800
research project.
Um,

44
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:45,753
he has taken a very complex problem,
is applied very complicated techniques 

45
00:02:50,381 --> 00:02:52,840
to try and solve the problem and he's 
brought it to completion.

46
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:54,010
It's a really good piece of work

47
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:58,170
and it has an immediate practical 
application.

48
00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:00,220
As a tennis coach myself,
it's fantastic

49
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:01,053
to have this tool to m to use with 
tennis players to help them develop 

50
00:03:03,701 --> 00:03:05,600
their strokes and to to analyze this 
rogue.

51
00:03:05,601 --> 00:03:06,050
So it's,
it's,

52
00:03:06,050 --> 00:03:09,530
it's an incredible discovery was done 
very well with a chair.

53
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:10,913
Of course it didn't end there.
Alexandra is project was automatically 

54
00:03:14,011 --> 00:03:17,970
entered into the European Union contest 
for young scientists and again,

55
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:19,410
won first prize.

56
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:22,880
There's four or five days and I think 
the,

57
00:03:23,630 --> 00:03:24,463
the,
the atmosphere in the exhibition was 

58
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:30,530
also incredible because you have top 
competitors,

59
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:31,543
they're winners of their national 
competition all coming together to 

60
00:03:34,311 --> 00:03:36,710
compete.
Again,

61
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:39,590
that is just being recognized for 
something like that.

62
00:03:39,591 --> 00:03:42,340
You pour your heart and soul into,
uh,

63
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:43,813
working on it.
So constantly to be recognized for 

64
00:03:45,321 --> 00:03:46,850
something like that is just a huge 
honor.

65
00:03:47,990 --> 00:03:50,000
Of course,
everyone at his school in Castle,

66
00:03:50,001 --> 00:03:52,430
not college,
couldn't be brighter from the first

67
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:56,380
arrived until this very moment.
He's been just tough class,

68
00:03:56,680 --> 00:04:00,190
an absolutely excellent student,
very dedicated.

69
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,270
He said to me on the first day,
uh,

70
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:04,510
when he wants to do the young scientist 
project,

71
00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:07,260
so I'm going to win it.
And he won it.

72
00:04:07,570 --> 00:04:11,350
I started to laugh but I shouldn't have.
But a very dedicated,

73
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:14,350
he doesn't sleep.
He works and Works and works.

74
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,930
Nobody asked it,
realizes how hard he works,

75
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:21,140
give her a rising tides,
lift all boats.

76
00:04:21,530 --> 00:04:22,363
And uh,
the entry this year we have never had 

77
00:04:25,161 --> 00:04:27,790
more interest into the young scientists 
at all sorts.

78
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:28,633
Increase the uptake of science subjects 
biology with three classes to leave us 

79
00:04:32,791 --> 00:04:33,624
or biology.

80
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:37,040
The hard work hasn't ended for Alexandra
though.

81
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:38,203
He skipped a school year in order to do 
the leaving cert early this July and 

82
00:04:41,721 --> 00:04:43,760
he's continuing to develop this project.

83
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:44,873
I've have two patents on my project and 
I hope to develop it further in the 

84
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,070
coming months and years.
It's applicable to tennis,

85
00:04:53,071 --> 00:04:53,904
but also a wide range of other fields.
So I'd love to start testing on things 

86
00:04:57,781 --> 00:05:02,781
like medical applications and sports 
rehabilitation,

87
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,390
medical rehabilitation,
and things like this.

88
00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:07,020
I think it has much more often

89
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:12,560
something like tennis.
Congratulations once again to Alexander,

90
00:05:14,331 --> 00:05:16,090
and we wish them the very best for the 
future.
