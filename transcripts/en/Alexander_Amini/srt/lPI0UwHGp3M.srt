1
00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:04,070
John stewart and his mission to satirize
the news was too successful.

2
00:00:04,130 --> 00:00:04,963
Ultimately,
his work resulted in the proliferation 

3
00:00:06,561 --> 00:00:07,394
of the news comedy format Ad Nauseum,
a conglomerate that has become large 

4
00:00:10,521 --> 00:00:12,620
enough to resemble the thing they set 
out to mock.

5
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:13,583
Let's start with news networks.
They too were victims of their own 

6
00:00:15,621 --> 00:00:16,454
success,
meaning that their success made them 

7
00:00:17,571 --> 00:00:18,404
betray their ideals.
News started out as a much humbler 

8
00:00:20,961 --> 00:00:23,630
servient profession.
Sure it was still a partisan,

9
00:00:23,631 --> 00:00:27,050
but there's a whole lot less of it and 
it carried some form of values including

10
00:00:27,051 --> 00:00:28,130
truth,
independence,

11
00:00:28,131 --> 00:00:30,830
fairness and impartiality.
But in the sixties,

12
00:00:30,831 --> 00:00:34,580
this change news networks realized that 
by getting advertisers involved,

13
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:37,070
you could make heaps of cash hand over 
fist,

14
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:37,933
fist over Mike's,
and there's a lot of nuance that I have 

15
00:00:40,131 --> 00:00:41,720
to skate over here,
but in essence,

16
00:00:41,721 --> 00:00:44,870
those values of journalism,
the reason most got into the game,

17
00:00:45,230 --> 00:00:47,510
they're squeezed into 24 slash seven 
news cycle.

18
00:00:48,470 --> 00:00:49,303
This was one of John Stewart's main 
premises in the daily show that the 24 

19
00:00:52,641 --> 00:00:56,870
hour news cycle is a system that is 
antithetical to good honest journalism.

20
00:00:57,340 --> 00:00:58,840
Media in general.
You said it yourself.

21
00:00:58,960 --> 00:00:59,793
It is focused on conflict,
it's focused on creating drama and a 

22
00:01:03,311 --> 00:01:05,410
false sense of urgency for better or for
worse,

23
00:01:05,411 --> 00:01:06,244
at 24 hour networks are now the leading 
light of our information age of 24 hour 

24
00:01:09,821 --> 00:01:12,010
news networks are built for one thing 
and that's nine slash 11.

25
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:13,173
In the absence of that,
they're not just going to say there's 

26
00:01:15,821 --> 00:01:20,230
not that much that's urgent or important
or conflicted happening today,

27
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:21,213
so we are going to gen up.
We are going to bring forth more 

28
00:01:25,361 --> 00:01:26,194
conflict and more sensationalism because
we want you to continue watching us 24 

29
00:01:29,891 --> 00:01:31,300
hours a day,
seven days a week,

30
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:35,620
even when the news doesn't necessarily 
warrant that type of behavior,

31
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:39,873
and in this ecosystem,
stuart thrive precisely because he 

32
00:01:42,461 --> 00:01:45,700
wasn't a journalist.
He's there to throw popcorn at the TV.

33
00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:50,980
He's there to mock sensational dialogue 
and insincerity and the daily show finds

34
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:51,993
enormous success,
but Stewart made a mark beyond himself 

35
00:01:54,910 --> 00:01:56,980
in the wake of his success.
The daily show turned out,

36
00:01:56,981 --> 00:01:59,800
satire host the way SNL turned out.
Comedians,

37
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:01,143
the daily show's original correspondence
now correspond almost completely to the 

38
00:02:04,361 --> 00:02:07,240
current comedy news programming.
John Oliver,

39
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:08,870
Samantha Bee,
Steven Cole,

40
00:02:08,871 --> 00:02:10,330
bear,
Jordan Kepler,

41
00:02:10,390 --> 00:02:14,440
there are a glut of these all daily show
apprentices and many of these have fun,

42
00:02:14,441 --> 00:02:17,530
a lot of success,
which has had ripple effects across late

43
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:20,140
night who are scrambling to compete with
what is working.

44
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:22,560
Jimmy Kimmel has found his political 
views,

45
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:24,540
of course,
and although he sounds very earnest,

46
00:02:24,541 --> 00:02:27,060
isn't that good timing?
Jimmy Fallon tried it on.

47
00:02:27,061 --> 00:02:30,090
Seth Meyers show has gotten political 
and SNL has raised.

48
00:02:30,091 --> 00:02:31,050
They're already politicized.

49
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:34,350
Show to a fever pitch of grandstanding.
The list could go on,

50
00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:35,243
so let's summarize.
We've got a bunch of really successful 

51
00:02:37,351 --> 00:02:39,570
shows,
making money hand over fist that are all

52
00:02:39,571 --> 00:02:42,420
competing for the same eyes,
rely on corrupt,

53
00:02:42,421 --> 00:02:43,254
crazy,
sensational things to happen every day 

54
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:47,340
to make into theater for their nightly 
shows.

55
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:50,070
Lineup up all these shows and they start
to resemble something.

56
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,560
Something that would garner spit balls 
from the back.

57
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:53,813
They all sound the same spoken like a 
guy who's suspiciously worried that 

58
00:02:57,331 --> 00:02:59,860
racist presidents don't get statues 
anymore.

59
00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:03,550
Is Donald trump a racist?
I'll let you decide.

60
00:03:03,551 --> 00:03:04,900
Yes.
For Yourself.

61
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:08,120
America might be white supremacists 
show.

62
00:03:08,121 --> 00:03:11,290
In my opinion,
this has everything to do with race.

63
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:13,083
It can be hypercritical of political 
villains and apologists for political 

64
00:03:15,311 --> 00:03:17,110
allies.
Thank you,

65
00:03:17,111 --> 00:03:20,080
Steven.
That's what I love about America.

66
00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:22,840
You know,
it's the only place where a secretary of

67
00:03:22,841 --> 00:03:26,410
state can be put on equal footing with a
screaming cantaloupe.

68
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:27,990
Okay,
fair enough.

69
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:29,063
Fair enough.

70
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:34,320
Are you concerned about the news that 
Russians may have hacked our election?

71
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:37,110
No.
Hillary lies because she didn't campaign

72
00:03:37,111 --> 00:03:39,220
in the swing states.
Moscow.

73
00:03:39,290 --> 00:03:43,910
It's a red state.
I understand.

74
00:03:43,911 --> 00:03:44,421
No,
I understand.

75
00:03:44,421 --> 00:03:45,254
I understand.
They become defacto journalists serving 

76
00:03:46,791 --> 00:03:48,170
many Americans,
their news,

77
00:03:48,171 --> 00:03:51,740
and they've become political actors.
Don't vote for Steven Harper.

78
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:52,763
Exactly.

79
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:55,893
Satire News became what they be held.
They overdramatize the absurdity of 

80
00:03:59,381 --> 00:04:00,214
politics to make headlines.
They pandered to a political party 

81
00:04:02,681 --> 00:04:03,514
instead of at least trying to be 
centrist and during slow news days with 

82
00:04:06,911 --> 00:04:09,340
so many political comedy shows,
what can they do?

83
00:04:09,610 --> 00:04:10,930
But to use stewards phrase,

84
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:13,850
we're going to gen up,
we're going to,

85
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:14,733
uh,
bring forth more conflict and more 

86
00:04:16,791 --> 00:04:20,810
sensationalism because we want you to 
continue watching us 24 hours a day,

87
00:04:20,811 --> 00:04:21,644
seven days a week,
even when the news doesn't necessarily 

88
00:04:24,201 --> 00:04:26,000
warrant that type of behavior.

89
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:29,970
All of the things that John Stewart sent
out to ridicule in news networks,

90
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,340
all our failings that his own proteges 
have.

91
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:34,800
And that is the tragedy of Jon Stewart.

92
00:04:39,910 --> 00:04:40,743
Yeah,

93
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:10,490
I think so.
If I'm wrong,

94
00:05:10,491 --> 00:05:11,720
I'm joking.
Obviously.
