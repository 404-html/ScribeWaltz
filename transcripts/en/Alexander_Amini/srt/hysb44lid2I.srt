1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,550
Starbucks is leading the war on 
Christmas in America,

2
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:05,040
or is it just a stupid Red Cup chick fil
a's?

3
00:00:05,041 --> 00:00:08,610
Owner hates gay people,
or is he just for family values?

4
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:09,803
Donald Trump's twitter is a place for 
him to speak his mind or is it just the 

5
00:00:12,481 --> 00:00:15,720
place for the ramblings of a lunatic?
I don't even need a cell phone.

6
00:00:15,721 --> 00:00:17,340
My thoughts are sent directly to the 
Internet.

7
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:18,263
Now I can reach out to their followers 
and tell them where without the 

8
00:00:19,921 --> 00:00:22,800
government,
what do all these things have in common?

9
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:24,013
Well,
they all have been helped by 

10
00:00:24,301 --> 00:00:26,280
controversy.
If you don't believe me,

11
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:27,173
let's run through them.
Starbucks stock price shot up after the 

12
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:30,653
Red Cup was announced,
chick filet had record breaking sales 

13
00:00:31,951 --> 00:00:34,800
that year and Donald trump is the 
president.

14
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:36,053
And why is this happening?
Why does controversy always seemed to 

15
00:00:37,831 --> 00:00:38,664
benefit someone?
We're going to talk about all of this 

16
00:00:40,171 --> 00:00:41,130
and more,
but first,

17
00:00:41,131 --> 00:00:43,800
let me say that controversy has a fine 
line to tread.

18
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:47,280
There needs to be a believable,
credible viewpoint on both sides.

19
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:48,263
So when you hear that Adam Sandler has 
had a controversial movie career since 

20
00:00:50,311 --> 00:00:51,930
his horror movie,
Jack and Jill,

21
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:54,370
that's not true because everyone agrees 
it's been bad,

22
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:55,763
but it might be controversial to say 
whether he still has a soul after 

23
00:00:57,931 --> 00:01:01,170
selling it for cash.
Someone say you can't forget about happy

24
00:01:01,171 --> 00:01:02,490
Gilmore.
Others would say,

25
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:04,020
yeah,
but Pixel.

26
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,930
Okay.
So to explain how controversy works,

27
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,030
first we have to talk about social 
media.

28
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:13,020
Social media sites have become the 
gatekeepers of what will be popular next

29
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:16,710
and they have a problem.
They have millions of posts each day and

30
00:01:16,711 --> 00:01:17,544
need a way to allow good posts to rise 
to the top and limit the reach of 

31
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:21,540
bandwidth.
And because of this,

32
00:01:21,541 --> 00:01:22,374
what all social media sites having 
common is that they heavily reward 

33
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:27,120
interaction and the reason is simple.

34
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:28,223
How else can a social media site no to 
promote something unless you click or 

35
00:01:30,601 --> 00:01:32,520
type something that essentially says,
Hey,

36
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:35,880
I found this post to be worth my time to
click my mouse or type on my keyboard.

37
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:39,180
So maybe others will too.
And there's a hierarchy of interaction.

38
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:40,373
It depends on the site,
but basically the rule of thumb is 

39
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:44,520
whatever people tend to do least is the 
most valuable.

40
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:45,473
So for example,
comments are better than likes on 

41
00:01:47,221 --> 00:01:48,054
facebook because people tend to comment 
less so it shows a higher level 

42
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:51,513
engagement that someone would comment 
and that's why in social media what's 

43
00:01:53,791 --> 00:01:56,340
more important than consensus is 
conversation.

44
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:59,250
So with all that in mind,
let's talk about controversy traps.

45
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:01,230
This is where controversy gets its 
power.

46
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:02,393
There are controversy traps we fall into
that make us accidentally promote 

47
00:02:04,621 --> 00:02:08,220
something when we're actually trying to 
make fun of them or argue their points.

48
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:11,940
This is because controversial things are
heavily interactive.

49
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:15,600
They bait you into responding.
If you see something that strikes you as

50
00:02:15,601 --> 00:02:17,970
crazy or wrong,
it's easy to want to respond,

51
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,540
but no matter how you do it,
it's only helping that controversy grow.

52
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:24,180
Even if you type up a comment,
I totally hate this,

53
00:02:24,181 --> 00:02:26,130
go die to facebook,
Insta,

54
00:02:26,131 --> 00:02:26,964
whatever.
What you're actually saying to the 

55
00:02:28,261 --> 00:02:31,590
social media site is,
I'm engaged and interested in this,

56
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:35,070
but there's another important element 
that helps make controversy so powerful.

57
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:36,173
It's the comment reply.
Once people start commenting on other 

58
00:02:38,551 --> 00:02:41,130
comments and generating entire back and 
forth arguments,

59
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:43,830
that is pure dopamine to your social 
network,

60
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:44,843
it's also fairly unique to controversial
topics and a video with consensus by 

61
00:02:48,181 --> 00:02:50,220
replied to someone over and over if you 
agree with it.

62
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:52,290
For most of us,
it's only when we disagree with someone.

63
00:02:52,291 --> 00:02:54,810
Do we ever come at once much less 
several times,

64
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:57,090
so when you think you're arguing 
throwaway account,

65
00:02:57,091 --> 00:03:00,700
1140 on the Internet on why that piece 
of content should have never been made.

66
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:03,310
You're actually smashing the like button
over and over.

67
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:05,890
The second controversy trap is even 
worse.

68
00:03:05,891 --> 00:03:09,250
It's the response article or video to 
the controversial topic.

69
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:10,263
This happens a lot where people will 
share and opposing take on a piece of 

70
00:03:12,371 --> 00:03:13,204
news or a person's actions,
which doesn't seem like a share because 

71
00:03:15,311 --> 00:03:17,980
they're taking the other side,
but just like in the case of comments,

72
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:21,160
you're actually feeding the beast 
because now your talking about something

73
00:03:21,161 --> 00:03:23,830
controversial.
This will intern drag people in from the

74
00:03:23,831 --> 00:03:27,250
other side and the cycle continues.
As long as there's someone to argue with

75
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:28,353
and the more controversial video is,
the more these controversial traps are 

76
00:03:30,851 --> 00:03:34,210
hard to avoid and when controversial 
topics are raking in tons of views,

77
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:37,360
this intern give that person more 
incentive to make videos like that,

78
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:38,463
which is why it's somewhat ironic when 
people complain that such ridiculous 

79
00:03:40,631 --> 00:03:41,464
topics gets so much attention,
they're getting attention in part 

80
00:03:43,691 --> 00:03:44,524
because you're commenting on them and 
complaining about how much attention 

81
00:03:46,211 --> 00:03:47,044
they're getting.

82
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:48,063
So to wrap up this video,
I thought I'd make a quick guide to 

83
00:03:50,081 --> 00:03:53,770
disliking anything on social media 
because it is so non intuitive.

84
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:58,930
Don't do anything.
The more outrage or annoyed you are,

85
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,790
the more you should keep your mouth 
shut.

86
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:04,630
Controversial things on social media or 
like a tar baby,

87
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:08,680
react and it only gets worse.
Ignore it and it will go away.

88
00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:09,783
The flip side of this is if you like a 
channel and want other people to know 

89
00:04:11,861 --> 00:04:14,110
about that channel to you know how to 
support it.

90
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:15,543
If you liked this video,
interact with me and the others in the 

91
00:04:17,081 --> 00:04:18,760
comments below,
and if you didn't,

92
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:19,511
please,
oh,

93
00:04:19,511 --> 00:04:22,540
please leave a mean comment in the 
comments section that'll show me.

94
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:26,470
Thanks for watching.
As a quick footnote,

95
00:04:26,471 --> 00:04:28,450
that didn't make it into the main part 
of the video.

96
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:29,513
One necessary caveat is that some social
media sites are better at suppressing 

97
00:04:32,231 --> 00:04:34,120
controversy than others.
For example,

98
00:04:34,121 --> 00:04:36,910
some have disliked systems in place.
That doesn't mean much sense.

99
00:04:36,911 --> 00:04:37,744
In places like youtube,
you can get millions of hits even with 

100
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:40,120
mostly dislikes.
Culver.

101
00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:40,963
In places like Reddit,
they have a very good system of sorting 

102
00:04:42,311 --> 00:04:43,144
posts that allows for dislikes,
so depending on the site you're on 

103
00:04:44,921 --> 00:04:47,230
disliking a video,
maybe a good alternative to nothing.
