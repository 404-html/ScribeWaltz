1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:02,250
So this is going to be a very different 
type of video.

2
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:03,570
We're going to talk about time 
management.

3
00:00:03,571 --> 00:00:04,404
There are a million ways to do this,
but we're going to talk about the way 

4
00:00:06,511 --> 00:00:07,344
that I do it specifically.
I found one way that works really well 

5
00:00:09,721 --> 00:00:10,554
for me.
So I became self employed this last 

6
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:13,583
January and one of the quickest things 
that appeared to me is that it's a big 

7
00:00:16,021 --> 00:00:19,860
deal to know how to manage your time and
really you have a twofold problem.

8
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:20,813
One,
you have to create and prioritize your 

9
00:00:22,561 --> 00:00:25,650
goals and deadlines.
And on the other hand you have to have a

10
00:00:25,651 --> 00:00:26,484
way to manage your time such that you 
achieve those goals and deadlines in a 

11
00:00:29,371 --> 00:00:31,680
timely manner.
And here's a fair disclaimer.

12
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:32,543
My system might not work for you,
but the important thing is to take what 

13
00:00:35,491 --> 00:00:36,324
you find useful here,
apply it to whatever you do and just 

14
00:00:39,151 --> 00:00:39,984
leave the rest.

15
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:41,220
All right,
so let's get into it.

16
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:42,990
I do three main things.
I managed my time.

17
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,850
Number one,
I just have a planner.

18
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:45,713
You know this is pretty boiler plate 
just to record any kind of trip 

19
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:50,213
appointment.
Meaning something time sensitive that I 

20
00:00:52,021 --> 00:00:53,850
need to do.
There's not much else to say there.

21
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:55,013
Number two,
I block out my day into 15 minute 

22
00:00:56,371 --> 00:00:58,740
increments and fill them out as the day 
goes.

23
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:00,510
I got this idea from the venture 
capitalists,

24
00:01:00,511 --> 00:01:02,160
Mike Jackson,
who's featured in the book.

25
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:03,023
So good they can't ignore you.
The reason for doing this is that I can 

26
00:01:06,031 --> 00:01:06,864
create a snapshot of what my day looked 
like and I can see what I spent all my 

27
00:01:10,321 --> 00:01:11,154
time on.
So I usually fill in the sheet whenever 

28
00:01:12,601 --> 00:01:13,434
I complete a major task.
So if editing this video took me from 

29
00:01:15,961 --> 00:01:17,160
12:00
PM to 4:00

30
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:21,180
PM I'll just fill in those blocks all at
once and I use colors to designate that.

31
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:22,493
If you create your own version of this,
you're going to have to make your own 

32
00:01:23,611 --> 00:01:27,240
buckets that are relevant to your life.
So at the beginning of each day it looks

33
00:01:27,241 --> 00:01:29,280
like this,
and by the end of it,

34
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:30,143
it looks like this.
And at this point I use a little macro 

35
00:01:32,431 --> 00:01:36,450
that I created to count up all the 15 
minute increments so I can see that,

36
00:01:36,451 --> 00:01:37,284
oh,
I spent,

37
00:01:37,370 --> 00:01:39,690
you know,
this percent working out today.

38
00:01:39,691 --> 00:01:42,240
I spent this percent reading,
et cetera.

39
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:44,640
Then we put in the date and hit this 
button,

40
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:47,310
which saves the file into just this time
archive folder,

41
00:01:47,311 --> 00:01:49,290
which I have,
which I'll show you right here.

42
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:52,530
What's really cool about this is that 
after doing it for like four months now,

43
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:53,603
I can look back on any given day of 
those four months and I can see exactly 

44
00:01:56,281 --> 00:01:59,010
what I was doing at any given time 
during the day,

45
00:01:59,070 --> 00:01:59,903
which is really cool and this brings us 
full circle to number three and number 

46
00:02:03,781 --> 00:02:04,080
three.

47
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:08,010
I have review periods where I see how 
much of my goals I achieved,

48
00:02:08,370 --> 00:02:09,203
what my progress was and how much of my 
week or month or whatever review period 

49
00:02:12,511 --> 00:02:13,344
I'm doing.
How much of that month was dedicated to 

50
00:02:15,271 --> 00:02:16,104
the right things,
how much of it could have been better 

51
00:02:17,761 --> 00:02:19,560
allocated somewhere else,
et cetera.

52
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:20,813
Basically I'm looking to see what I did 
right and what I did wrong and what I 

53
00:02:23,311 --> 00:02:26,220
can achieve better next time.
This is a super underrated thing.

54
00:02:26,221 --> 00:02:28,500
People think that just because your time
is in the past,

55
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:31,530
you should never look back.
You should absolutely look back.

56
00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:32,843
All good time management system should 
have some type of review system to see 

57
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:37,283
how you actually did.
Anytime that you add in any extra 

58
00:02:39,991 --> 00:02:41,220
things,
some kind of goal,

59
00:02:41,221 --> 00:02:42,054
some kind of,
you know you want to try running once a 

60
00:02:43,501 --> 00:02:44,334
week,
you have to know how you did and so 

61
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:47,430
that's what this allows you to do.

62
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:51,120
So in this sample week you can see how 
much I read,

63
00:02:51,121 --> 00:02:53,850
how much I worked out,
how much time I wasted,

64
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:55,740
the percentage of my week that it all 
took up.

65
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:59,890
And this is super powerful to let you 
know where you can improve.

66
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:01,360
If you think,
oh man,

67
00:03:01,361 --> 00:03:02,680
I spend more time on that than I 
thought,

68
00:03:02,681 --> 00:03:05,020
I'm going to move that over here,
you can do that.

69
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:05,913
So that's pretty much it.
This time management system has been 

70
00:03:07,361 --> 00:03:10,990
absolutely essential to me.
And I think if you're an entrepreneur or

71
00:03:10,991 --> 00:03:15,070
you're somebody who is self employed or 
just you know anybody who's very serious

72
00:03:15,071 --> 00:03:17,620
about their time,
I think something like this would really

73
00:03:17,621 --> 00:03:18,454
help you out.
So I'm going to leave my daily 

74
00:03:20,711 --> 00:03:25,330
spreadsheets as well as my review 
spreadsheets in the links below with all

75
00:03:25,331 --> 00:03:26,164
the macros already in them.
And I'm going to create a second video 

76
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:30,700
to explain how to use them.
If your interested also,

77
00:03:30,701 --> 00:03:31,534
if you want to learn more,
go check out David Allen's getting 

78
00:03:33,851 --> 00:03:34,684
things done.
Plenty of people have found him to be 

79
00:03:36,011 --> 00:03:37,300
awesome as well.
Okay,

80
00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:38,950
that's all for now.
Be sure to comment.

81
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:41,140
If you have a system that already works 
for you,

82
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:43,540
you can subscribe.
If you like the content,

83

check out the next video here where I 
explained all my spreadsheets and thank 

84
00:03:47,891 --> 00:03:48,724
you guys so much for watching.
I will see you next week with another 

85
00:03:50,501 --> 00:03:51,334
coffee break.
