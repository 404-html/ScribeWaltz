00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:01,043
If you had to bet on the next 
presidential election based on one 

2
00:00:03,001 --> 00:00:04,110
trait,
what would you pick?

3
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:05,430
Wealth,
hair,

4
00:00:05,431 --> 00:00:06,960
color,
family history,

5
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:09,480
illuminati membership size of their 
super pack,

6
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:11,720
maybe size of their hands.
Well,

7
00:00:11,721 --> 00:00:12,554
Professor Greg are.
Marie has the answer to this in his 

8
00:00:14,011 --> 00:00:16,740
paper on how physical traits affect our 
choices in leaders.

9
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:21,510
Marie found that from 1789 to 2012,
if you had bet on the taller candidate,

10
00:00:21,511 --> 00:00:24,060
you would have been right 58 percent of 
the time.

11
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:26,700
That alone should probably be the end of
the video.

12
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:29,820
Fifty eight percent isn't insane.
Advantage if you consider that height,

13
00:00:29,821 --> 00:00:30,654
has nothing to do with actual knowledge 
of how to run a country or foreign 

14
00:00:33,031 --> 00:00:33,864
policy.
So with that we should be able to exit 

15
00:00:35,131 --> 00:00:35,964
out of this video.
Sad that our elections have been so 

16
00:00:37,351 --> 00:00:39,960
extensively hijacked by biological 
prejudices,

17
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:41,063
but unfortunately it doesn't stop there 
because our data set isn't a complete 

18
00:00:44,191 --> 00:00:44,880
picture yet.

19
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:45,713
Nobody decided their vote based on 
height before the television because 

20
00:00:48,181 --> 00:00:50,640
they couldn't.
They voted based only on what they heard

21
00:00:50,641 --> 00:00:51,474
from the radio and news only since 1960.
And we had televised debates where the 

22
00:00:54,841 --> 00:00:56,880
voters have been able to clearly tell 
who is color.

23
00:00:57,060 --> 00:00:57,893
So if we separate out these data sets 
into before television and after 

24
00:01:00,091 --> 00:01:01,740
television,
we find two things.

25
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:02,993
First in the elections before 1960,
our assumptions that they were 

26
00:01:05,581 --> 00:01:07,590
unaffected by height turns out to be 
true.

27
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:08,663
The odds of the taller candidate winning
drops to 51 percent as we would expect 

28
00:01:11,491 --> 00:01:14,100
if people not able to see their 
candidates before voting for them.

29
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:16,620
Secondly,
in our post television data set,

30
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:18,930
our biological prejudices are worse than
we thought.

31
00:01:19,410 --> 00:01:20,243
From 1960 to 2016,
the taller candidate has won 67 percent 

32
00:01:24,361 --> 00:01:25,710
of the time.
Also,

33
00:01:25,711 --> 00:01:28,350
if one candidate is more than three 
inches taller than the other,

34
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:30,990
their chances of winning go up to 83 
percent.

35
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:32,273
Again,
it's absolutely insane that height 

36
00:01:33,901 --> 00:01:37,260
matters this much to our elections.
But although this is a bit depressing,

37
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:40,050
it is in line with what we know about 
behavioral psychology.

38
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:42,270
There are many theories on why we like 
color leaders.

39
00:01:42,330 --> 00:01:43,163
Some studies say height is an advantage 
in fights because it means you're 

40
00:01:45,181 --> 00:01:46,014
punching down,
which generates more forced and makes 

41
00:01:47,221 --> 00:01:49,560
you a better fighter and a primitive 
setting.

42
00:01:49,561 --> 00:01:52,710
This is how you would elect a leader.
The strongest man would eventually win.

43
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:53,993
Other theories suggest that we pick our 
leaders based on who we physically look 

44
00:01:56,071 --> 00:01:57,620
up to.
Think of when you're a child,

45
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:58,473
your peers are always those who are 
generally around your height and the 

46
00:02:00,361 --> 00:02:01,194
adults.
The people who know stuff are the ones 

47
00:02:02,971 --> 00:02:03,804
that are taller and bigger than you.
It's possible that we never get rid of 

48
00:02:05,971 --> 00:02:06,804
that bias when we grow up and see people
who are taller as being authority 

49
00:02:09,031 --> 00:02:11,400
figures,
but no matter the explanation,

50
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:13,980
one thing is clear.
We want a leader who can draw the center

51
00:02:13,981 --> 00:02:16,290
of attention and dominate a room 
physically.

52
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:17,753
We perceive them to be better suited for
the job regardless of whether that is 

53
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:23,330
actually true or not.
We always look to the tall guy,

54
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:24,803
so if you want to know who the next 
president will be when the election 

55
00:02:26,311 --> 00:02:27,480
cycle rolls around,
again,

56
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:31,710
it might be worth meeting the debate and
just checking who is looking up to who.
