Speaker 1:          00:00          John stewart and his mission to satirize the news was too successful. Ultimately, his work resulted in the proliferation of the news comedy format Ad Nauseum, a conglomerate that has become large enough to resemble the thing they set out to mock. Let's start with news networks. They too were victims of their own success, meaning that their success made them betray their ideals. News started out as a much humbler servient profession. Sure it was still a partisan, but there's a whole lot less of it and it carried some form of values including truth, independence, fairness and impartiality. But in the sixties, this change news networks realized that by getting advertisers involved, you could make heaps of cash hand over fist, fist over Mike's, and there's a lot of nuance that I have to skate over here, but in essence, those values of journalism, the reason most got into the game, they're squeezed into 24 slash seven news cycle. This was one of John Stewart's main premises in the daily show that the 24 hour news cycle is a system that is antithetical to good honest journalism.

Speaker 2:          00:57          Media in general. You said it yourself. It is focused on conflict, it's focused on creating drama and a false sense of urgency for better or for worse, at 24 hour networks are now the leading light of our information age of 24 hour news networks are built for one thing and that's nine slash 11. In the absence of that, they're not just going to say there's not that much that's urgent or important or conflicted happening today, so we are going to gen up. We are going to bring forth more conflict and more sensationalism because we want you to continue watching us 24 hours a day, seven days a week, even when the news doesn't necessarily warrant that type of behavior,

Speaker 1:          01:39          and in this ecosystem, stuart thrive precisely because he wasn't a journalist. He's there to throw popcorn at the TV. He's there to mock sensational dialogue and insincerity and the daily show finds enormous success, but Stewart made a mark beyond himself in the wake of his success. The daily show turned out, satire host the way SNL turned out. Comedians, the daily show's original correspondence now correspond almost completely to the current comedy news programming. John Oliver, Samantha Bee, Steven Cole, bear, Jordan Kepler, there are a glut of these all daily show apprentices and many of these have fun, a lot of success, which has had ripple effects across late night who are scrambling to compete with what is working. Jimmy Kimmel has found his political views, of course, and although he sounds very earnest, isn't that good timing? Jimmy Fallon tried it on. Seth Meyers show has gotten political and SNL has raised. They're already politicized.

Speaker 1:          02:31          Show to a fever pitch of grandstanding. The list could go on, so let's summarize. We've got a bunch of really successful shows, making money hand over fist that are all competing for the same eyes, rely on corrupt, crazy, sensational things to happen every day to make into theater for their nightly shows. Lineup up all these shows and they start to resemble something. Something that would garner spit balls from the back. They all sound the same spoken like a guy who's suspiciously worried that racist presidents don't get statues anymore. Is Donald trump a racist? I'll let you decide. Yes. For Yourself. America might be white supremacists show. In my opinion, this has everything to do with race. It can be hypercritical of political villains and apologists for political allies. Thank you, Steven. That's what I love about America. You know, it's the only place where a secretary of state can be put on equal footing with a screaming cantaloupe.

Speaker 3:          03:27          Okay, fair enough. Fair enough.

Speaker 1:          03:29          Are you concerned about the news that Russians may have hacked our election? No. Hillary lies because she didn't campaign in the swing states. Moscow. It's a red state. I understand. No, I understand. I understand. They become defacto journalists serving many Americans, their news, and they've become political actors. Don't vote for Steven Harper.

Speaker 3:          03:51          Exactly.

Speaker 1:          03:55          Satire News became what they be held. They overdramatize the absurdity of politics to make headlines. They pandered to a political party instead of at least trying to be centrist and during slow news days with so many political comedy shows, what can they do? But to use stewards phrase,

Speaker 2:          04:11          we're going to gen up, we're going to, uh, bring forth more conflict and more sensationalism because we want you to continue watching us 24 hours a day, seven days a week, even when the news doesn't necessarily warrant that type of behavior.

Speaker 1:          04:26          All of the things that John Stewart sent out to ridicule in news networks, all our failings that his own proteges have. And that is the tragedy of Jon Stewart.

Speaker 4:          04:39          Yeah,

Speaker 3:          05:06          I think so. If I'm wrong, I'm joking. Obviously.
