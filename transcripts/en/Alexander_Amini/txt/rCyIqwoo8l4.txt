Speaker 1:          00:00          Hi Guys. It's been awhile. I've been swamped with work as well as putting together one of my largest videos ever. Sorry. I hope you all bear with me while I get that finished. In the gap of uploads though, I really wanted to tell you about some awesome things that I thought couldn't wait. The biggest thing is that we hit 100,000 subscribers late February, which is absolutely amazing. The same time last February, I had set some goals for this channel and of all of them, the most ambitious of them was to get to 50,000 subs in one year. To really understand how crazy that goal was to me at the time. First you have to know that I had a youtube channel before this making piano videos and it took me 80 videos over two years to get 100 subscribers, so zero to 50 K in one year was pretty much shooting for the moon and even by last July I only had 300 subscribers on this channel.

Speaker 1:          00:48          So I had thought that goal was dead in the water, but thanks to you all who watch these videos and shared them, we not only hit that goal, we doubled it. You all made that amazing goal possible. So thank you. Now I think the question is now that we have all these people here, what are we going to do to make this channel even better? Well first we got our subreddit r slash coffee break. One word started on reddit. We don't have many people there yet, but that's about to change and it's going to eventually become a big part of this community. We already have a discord, which is more like a chat room, but reddit superior comment sorting makes it better for group discussion. So why don't you guys to go subscribe over there. It's going to be a great place to meet like minded people and discuss videos and ideas.

Speaker 1:          01:28          It will also be a place for future announcements such as the one in this video. Secondly, I wanted to tell you that I do a lot of research for these videos and I want to make that more visible going forward. So I'm going to be putting more and more effort into getting good footnotes for these videos. If you want to learn more about the subjects I talk about. The third thing I can't talk too much about yet, but I plan on focusing more on coffee break soon. If you look at my backlog, I used to upload once a week, but that had slowed down because of work related stuff that's going to change come April or May and we're going to try to ramp back up to a more frequent uploads schedule. And finally, as part of the 100 k celebration, I decided to take this moment to highlight the lesser known people behind the show, the musicians whose music I feature on the channel.

Speaker 1:          02:10          Music has always been huge for this channel and I'm sure it's part of the reason a lot of you like listening to me. So I'm going to be uploading a best of coffee break music mix right after this video to essentially throw a spotlight on just how talented these people are. I'm uploading it separately from this video, so if you guys want to just put it on his study music or whatever, you don't have to listen to my annoying preamble every time, but if I could just ask of you, when you go to listen to the music mix, if you like one of the songs, please go check out the artist's actual page and comment telling them you came from coffee break. All the artists they feature on here are incredible, and the songs I show only scratched the surface. All right? That's pretty much it. To recap, reddit more videos around April and May and go check out some of those amazing artists. I feel so blessed to reach a hundred k subs in one year, and I'm looking forward to where we go from here. Thank you for watching.
