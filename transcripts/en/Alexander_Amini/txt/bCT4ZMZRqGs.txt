Speaker 1:          00:00          Last year's winner was Alexandra [inaudible] from Dublin. He was 15 when he won the competition with his work on tennis sensor data analysis. But it didn't stop there. I was doing a, Sullivan has been finding out

Speaker 2:          00:23          seating at the bt young scientists competition is all about hard work and no one exemplifies this more. And last year's winner Alexander, I'm Mimi, he arrived in Ireland from New York, but he's found he just two years ago quickly set his sights on the competition.

Speaker 1:          00:40          It was a really something that came to me like overnight because uh, I play a lot of tennis and it was just the idea of trying to create a system to help tennis players because coaching can be so expensive. It's something that is a such a luxury for tennis athletes. So to have something like a program that can provide real time feedback, unbiased feedback to an athlete in real time is just a necessity for every time I sit down.

Speaker 2:          01:09          Alexander has been playing from a very early age, so it probably wasn't surprising he chose to incorporate in this project.

Speaker 1:          01:19          Um, my whole family faced this actually. So I have two sisters and one brother. We all play tennis. My Dad started us, uh, to play tennis and he's been all of our coach. Uh, so my project is just a motion refinement and recognition system. So I turned my projects for tennis and specific. But what it does is just recognized as the type of motions that a athlete or a person is performing and then tries to provide feedback on how to improve these motions.

Speaker 2:          01:50          Alexandre use the facilities here at tennis Ireland in Dcu for his project as their courts can be filmed from several different angles from cameras located high on the walls. Alexandra use the raw data from tennis sessions, played here to write his own computer program which can interpret how good your tennis swing is from the signal sent from a motion sensor worn on the wrist. He used 13 different computer languages to write the software and unsurprisingly wild the judges,

Speaker 3:          02:19          the bt young scientists and technologists. I'll the year 2011

Speaker 2:          02:24          is it

Speaker 3:          02:25          Alexander?

Speaker 4:          02:30          This I have to say is well, the best ones we've ever seen at a working level in terms of research. This is an excellent project compared to a an honors undergraduate degree level or even postgraduate degree level research project. Um, he has taken a very complex problem, is applied very complicated techniques to try and solve the problem and he's brought it to completion. It's a really good piece of work

Speaker 2:          02:55          and it has an immediate practical application. As a tennis coach myself, it's fantastic

Speaker 5:          03:00          to have this tool to m to use with tennis players to help them develop their strokes and to to analyze this rogue. So it's, it's, it's an incredible discovery was done very well with a chair.

Speaker 2:          03:10          Of course it didn't end there. Alexandra is project was automatically entered into the European Union contest for young scientists and again, won first prize.

Speaker 1:          03:19          There's four or five days and I think the, the, the atmosphere in the exhibition was also incredible because you have top competitors, they're winners of their national competition all coming together to compete. Again, that is just being recognized for something like that. You pour your heart and soul into, uh, working on it. So constantly to be recognized for something like that is just a huge honor.

Speaker 2:          03:47          Of course, everyone at his school in Castle, not college, couldn't be brighter from the first

Speaker 5:          03:52          arrived until this very moment. He's been just tough class, an absolutely excellent student, very dedicated. He said to me on the first day, uh, when he wants to do the young scientist project, so I'm going to win it. And he won it. I started to laugh but I shouldn't have. But a very dedicated, he doesn't sleep. He works and Works and works. Nobody asked it, realizes how hard he works, give her a rising tides, lift all boats. And uh, the entry this year we have never had more interest into the young scientists at all sorts. Increase the uptake of science subjects biology with three classes to leave us or biology.

Speaker 2:          04:34          The hard work hasn't ended for Alexandra though. He skipped a school year in order to do the leaving cert early this July and he's continuing to develop this project.

Speaker 1:          04:44          I've have two patents on my project and I hope to develop it further in the coming months and years. It's applicable to tennis, but also a wide range of other fields. So I'd love to start testing on things like medical applications and sports rehabilitation, medical rehabilitation, and things like this. I think it has much more often

Speaker 2:          05:07          something like tennis. Congratulations once again to Alexander, and we wish them the very best for the future.
