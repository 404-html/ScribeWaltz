Speaker 1:          00:00          Why don't more people care about my thing. It's unbelievable the way the rest of you just blissfully live your lives, unconcerned with the real issues of this world. After all, take any aspect of your life. My group would agree that my thing is the most pressing thing about it. Don't you all realize how serious this is? I mean, let's not even talk about people with a different opinion of my thing. The fact that they don't agree with my fax means that they're willfully ignoring the facts. No, I'm talking to you. The one with no dog in this fight. Really your the one to blame here. You keep talking about your thing and going on about that, but you have to realize by not taking action on my thing, you're perpetuating the problem in action is action and you've done quite enough for ready, I guess silly me for thinking that other people would actually be logical and reasonable for a change and realize that my thing should be as important to them as it is to me. It just breaks my heart. Why don't more people care about my thing?

Speaker 2:          01:01          Okay.
