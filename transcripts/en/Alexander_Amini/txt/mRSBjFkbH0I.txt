Speaker 1:          00:00          You and I both know that the title of this video is a lie. I'm never going to delete it, but nonetheless, you clicked on it. On the odd chance I do delete it. You get to be part of the lucky few that gets to see this video before it disappears into the void, and that's what we're going to talk about today. That feeling of scarcity and specifically how people market to that scarcity to make you look at things, want things and buy things. Have you ever noticed how much advertisers talk about limits and urgency?

Speaker 2:          00:26          We live the thrill of beating the clock. Any sized soft drinks for a dollar won't stick around long. Buy One, get one free this Friday and Saturday, only October. Hurry in now to October savings end soon. Now, why do advertisers do this? Some of you may feel that this is merely incidental. All good things come to an end after all, but that isn't quite true. Companies deliberately want to send you the message that this, this incredible deal won't be here for long because the reason we want things, the reason we buy things often has very little to do with the product and everything to do with how the ad makes us feel and selling. Scarcity is all about making you and I feel like we've been given opportunity. Opportunity is not the same as being given a choice. Opportunity is a choice, but it has a special component. It's a time bound choice.

Speaker 2:          01:13          It has to be seized. It won't be there for long. It forces action. You can have this product at this specially discounted rate, but the deal ends this weekend. It forces you to say yes or no to a deal because inaction is a choice and it may surprise you, but this is different from our normal behavior. Think about when you're in a store. Normally. Usually when you pass up on a product, you're not actually saying no to it. You're just saying maybe later we do this all the time. We're procrastinators by nature and if allowed will shop around for awhile because the implication with most goods and services is that they're going to still be there when you come back, but with limited time or limited quantity sales, the goal is to remove the option of saying maybe a later to an object. He'd forces action, say yes and buy it or say no and kiss this deal goodbye forever and this is a fundamental change and can push you from uncertainty to buying a product out of fear that it will be gone if you come back later and just how effective is this form of marketing?

Speaker 2:          02:14          Well, let's look at Amazon, the largest distributor in store in the world. What does the most successful store do you when it puts on huge sales, it put scarcity marketing to work and from two different angles. Look at this. This is not only a limited time sale and it's not only a limited quantity sale, it's both and when it's done, it's done. This one little web widget that tracks how much of the product has moved and tracks how much time has passed moves product like crazy. Take for instance, this seller who during a four hour lightning sales sold over 6,000 units when they normally would have sold four to $500 in a given day. That's a 1300 percent increase in sales for taking 20 percent off the price and putting it on the lightning page or to put that in business. So what does consumer psychology have to say about this?

Speaker 2:          03:03          Well, there's react in theory and there's commodity react. In theory developed by Jack Brown says that when an individual's freedom to engage in a specific behavior is threatened, the threatened behavior becomes more attractive. This is why, for instance, when politicians mentioned gun control ammunition flies off the shelves because gun owners are worried about their future ability to buy it. It's also why this video title is so provocative because I'm threatening to take it away from you. The other theory we're going to explore is commodity theory. This idea developed by brock and fromkin suggests that goods which appeared to be scarce are considered to be more valuable. This is the idea behind diamonds which are actually not rare at all, but due to a very tightly controlled supply have artificially sustain the high price point. So when marketing companies tell you that something isn't, soon, they're trying to artificially restrict the supply to raise the value in your mind. Now, I think a mixture of both of these theories come into play in shaping how we respond to perceived scarcity, but either way, scarcity

Speaker 3:          04:03          plays on our ancient impulses to take advantage of limited resources. And this idea hits particularly close to home for me because as some of you know, I work a sales job selling houses as my main nine to five job and when we run promotionals, we do it to generate this exact kind of feeling I've been talking about. Because when people want to take their time and mull over a decision, it can lead them to buying nothing at all. So to get a positional advantage, we run promos periodically to get the leverage to say enough thinking. It's time to make a decision. I mean, you do want to take advantage of this big sale, don't you? In reality, is there any reason the house houses should be less expensive that month? No, but we want people to think there is because it creates urgency. Our reaction to scarcity is a powerful force in advertising and marketing. It plays on one of our most fundamental instincts to not miss out on opportunity, and this bias is exploited constantly by businesses who use advertising and marketing tactics to create artificial scarcity. So just as a rule of thumb, if you live in a developed country where abundance is the norm, rather than the exception, you can begin to safely make the assumption that if someone is telling you supplies are low, they're probably trying to sell you something.
