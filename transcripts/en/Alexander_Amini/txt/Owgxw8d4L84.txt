Speaker 1:          00:00          So this is going to be a very different type of video. We're going to talk about time management. There are a million ways to do this, but we're going to talk about the way that I do it specifically. I found one way that works really well for me. So I became self employed this last January and one of the quickest things that appeared to me is that it's a big deal to know how to manage your time and really you have a twofold problem. One, you have to create and prioritize your goals and deadlines. And on the other hand you have to have a way to manage your time such that you achieve those goals and deadlines in a timely manner. And here's a fair disclaimer. My system might not work for you, but the important thing is to take what you find useful here, apply it to whatever you do and just leave the rest.

Speaker 1:          00:40          All right, so let's get into it. I do three main things. I managed my time. Number one, I just have a planner. You know this is pretty boiler plate just to record any kind of trip appointment. Meaning something time sensitive that I need to do. There's not much else to say there. Number two, I block out my day into 15 minute increments and fill them out as the day goes. I got this idea from the venture capitalists, Mike Jackson, who's featured in the book. So good they can't ignore you. The reason for doing this is that I can create a snapshot of what my day looked like and I can see what I spent all my time on. So I usually fill in the sheet whenever I complete a major task. So if editing this video took me from 12:00 PM to 4:00 PM I'll just fill in those blocks all at once and I use colors to designate that.

Speaker 1:          01:21          If you create your own version of this, you're going to have to make your own buckets that are relevant to your life. So at the beginning of each day it looks like this, and by the end of it, it looks like this. And at this point I use a little macro that I created to count up all the 15 minute increments so I can see that, oh, I spent, you know, this percent working out today. I spent this percent reading, et cetera. Then we put in the date and hit this button, which saves the file into just this time archive folder, which I have, which I'll show you right here. What's really cool about this is that after doing it for like four months now, I can look back on any given day of those four months and I can see exactly what I was doing at any given time during the day, which is really cool and this brings us full circle to number three and number three.

Speaker 1:          02:04          I have review periods where I see how much of my goals I achieved, what my progress was and how much of my week or month or whatever review period I'm doing. How much of that month was dedicated to the right things, how much of it could have been better allocated somewhere else, et cetera. Basically I'm looking to see what I did right and what I did wrong and what I can achieve better next time. This is a super underrated thing. People think that just because your time is in the past, you should never look back. You should absolutely look back. All good time management system should have some type of review system to see how you actually did. Anytime that you add in any extra things, some kind of goal, some kind of, you know you want to try running once a week, you have to know how you did and so that's what this allows you to do.

Speaker 1:          02:47          So in this sample week you can see how much I read, how much I worked out, how much time I wasted, the percentage of my week that it all took up. And this is super powerful to let you know where you can improve. If you think, oh man, I spend more time on that than I thought, I'm going to move that over here, you can do that. So that's pretty much it. This time management system has been absolutely essential to me. And I think if you're an entrepreneur or you're somebody who is self employed or just you know anybody who's very serious about their time, I think something like this would really help you out. So I'm going to leave my daily spreadsheets as well as my review spreadsheets in the links below with all the macros already in them. And I'm going to create a second video to explain how to use them. If your interested also, if you want to learn more, go check out David Allen's getting things done. Plenty of people have found him to be awesome as well. Okay, that's all for now. Be sure to comment. If you have a system that already works for you, you can subscribe. If you like the content, check out the next video here where I explained all my spreadsheets and thank you guys so much for watching. I will see you next week with another coffee break.
