Speaker 1:          00:00          Starbucks is leading the war on Christmas in America, or is it just a stupid Red Cup chick fil a's? Owner hates gay people, or is he just for family values? Donald Trump's twitter is a place for him to speak his mind or is it just the place for the ramblings of a lunatic? I don't even need a cell phone. My thoughts are sent directly to the Internet. Now I can reach out to their followers and tell them where without the government, what do all these things have in common? Well, they all have been helped by controversy. If you don't believe me, let's run through them. Starbucks stock price shot up after the Red Cup was announced, chick filet had record breaking sales that year and Donald trump is the president. And why is this happening? Why does controversy always seemed to benefit someone? We're going to talk about all of this and more, but first, let me say that controversy has a fine line to tread.

Speaker 1:          00:44          There needs to be a believable, credible viewpoint on both sides. So when you hear that Adam Sandler has had a controversial movie career since his horror movie, Jack and Jill, that's not true because everyone agrees it's been bad, but it might be controversial to say whether he still has a soul after selling it for cash. Someone say you can't forget about happy Gilmore. Others would say, yeah, but Pixel. Okay. So to explain how controversy works, first we have to talk about social media. Social media sites have become the gatekeepers of what will be popular next and they have a problem. They have millions of posts each day and need a way to allow good posts to rise to the top and limit the reach of bandwidth. And because of this, what all social media sites having common is that they heavily reward interaction and the reason is simple.

Speaker 1:          01:27          How else can a social media site no to promote something unless you click or type something that essentially says, Hey, I found this post to be worth my time to click my mouse or type on my keyboard. So maybe others will too. And there's a hierarchy of interaction. It depends on the site, but basically the rule of thumb is whatever people tend to do least is the most valuable. So for example, comments are better than likes on facebook because people tend to comment less so it shows a higher level engagement that someone would comment and that's why in social media what's more important than consensus is conversation. So with all that in mind, let's talk about controversy traps. This is where controversy gets its power. There are controversy traps we fall into that make us accidentally promote something when we're actually trying to make fun of them or argue their points.

Speaker 1:          02:08          This is because controversial things are heavily interactive. They bait you into responding. If you see something that strikes you as crazy or wrong, it's easy to want to respond, but no matter how you do it, it's only helping that controversy grow. Even if you type up a comment, I totally hate this, go die to facebook, Insta, whatever. What you're actually saying to the social media site is, I'm engaged and interested in this, but there's another important element that helps make controversy so powerful. It's the comment reply. Once people start commenting on other comments and generating entire back and forth arguments, that is pure dopamine to your social network, it's also fairly unique to controversial topics and a video with consensus by replied to someone over and over if you agree with it. For most of us, it's only when we disagree with someone. Do we ever come at once much less several times, so when you think you're arguing throwaway account, 1140 on the Internet on why that piece of content should have never been made.

Speaker 1:          03:00          You're actually smashing the like button over and over. The second controversy trap is even worse. It's the response article or video to the controversial topic. This happens a lot where people will share and opposing take on a piece of news or a person's actions, which doesn't seem like a share because they're taking the other side, but just like in the case of comments, you're actually feeding the beast because now your talking about something controversial. This will intern drag people in from the other side and the cycle continues. As long as there's someone to argue with and the more controversial video is, the more these controversial traps are hard to avoid and when controversial topics are raking in tons of views, this intern give that person more incentive to make videos like that, which is why it's somewhat ironic when people complain that such ridiculous topics gets so much attention, they're getting attention in part because you're commenting on them and complaining about how much attention they're getting.

Speaker 1:          03:47          So to wrap up this video, I thought I'd make a quick guide to disliking anything on social media because it is so non intuitive. Don't do anything. The more outrage or annoyed you are, the more you should keep your mouth shut. Controversial things on social media or like a tar baby, react and it only gets worse. Ignore it and it will go away. The flip side of this is if you like a channel and want other people to know about that channel to you know how to support it. If you liked this video, interact with me and the others in the comments below, and if you didn't, please, oh, please leave a mean comment in the comments section that'll show me. Thanks for watching. As a quick footnote, that didn't make it into the main part of the video. One necessary caveat is that some social media sites are better at suppressing controversy than others. For example, some have disliked systems in place. That doesn't mean much sense. In places like youtube, you can get millions of hits even with mostly dislikes. Culver. In places like Reddit, they have a very good system of sorting posts that allows for dislikes, so depending on the site you're on disliking a video, maybe a good alternative to nothing.
