Speaker 1:          00:00          Every year, the US Postal Service, since on average 41 pounds of junk mail to you to achieve that feat, companies spin $47,000,000,000 a year to get that garbage in your mailbox. It's a nuisance and all that paper adds up to 26 million trees being cut down each year just for junk mail. Most of it going to the landfill, 44 percent of it never even opened. Also, every day, $54 billion spam emails are sent at eight pieces of spam for every man, woman, and child on earth per day. You've got mail and also everyday telemarketers call 80 million people in the U, s with courtesy calls, which is such a shamelessly ironic term that it has all been obliterated. The meaning of courtesy, this is lead most people to not even answer a number if it's not in their contact list, and all of this just boils down to being unknown to you and ultimately waste her time.

Speaker 1:          00:45          Every second you have to spend during way mail sorting emails are screening calls. Luckily people like us, I've already complained in the past and solutions had been created for these problems. The problem is they aren't very well known or advertise, so people aren't taking advantage of them and we're about to change that junk mail. Two solutions, first DMA choice.org. The DMA is the largest direct marketing organization in the US and they send most of the junk mail that you get on this website. You can opt out from receiving junk mail from any and all of their advertisers. There's a $2 processing fee, but it'll keep you off there. Do not contact mailing list for 10 years, so I think it's worth it. Second, opt out. Prescreened.com. It's a free service that puts you on a do not mail list for credit card and insurance offers. Okay. Next spam email. We're going to use DMA choice that org for this. Again, on that same website, you can also opt out from hearing from any of their companies by email and this will last six years and it's free. Also, make sure you have a gmail account which has a great spam filter. Okay. Finally, courtesy calls do not call.gov. have you ever answered an unknown number? Just to hear this,

Speaker 2:          01:46          congratulations. You've been selected to receive a free cruise to the Bahamas.

Speaker 1:          01:51          Well, the Federal Trade Commission has started a do not call registry. That makes it illegal for telemarketers to do that to you. It's free and it takes two minutes to sign your number up. It doesn't expire, so you never have to renew this and any telemarketer calling anyone on this list will be fined up to $40,000. All right, that's it. You can knock all this out in less than two minutes and it will save you a ton of time and headache in the future. This has been a public service announcement from coffee break and you guys have a great week.
