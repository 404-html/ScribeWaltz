Speaker 1:          00:00          There are two ways to use music as the foreground itself, an object of attention or as the background that contextualizes the rest of your world. Instrumental music often falls into that latter category. Humble and unassuming. Most people overlook this kind of music in favor of music that has a direct message. In fact, instrumental music almost never comes up on the charts and the same way that songs, it just doesn't capture people's attention in the same way and I think that's because many people misunderstand the role of instrumental music. We often listen to instrumentals as we would a song and that's a mistake. When we listened to songs, our mind is automatically parsing it for meaning for understanding of the songwriters message. And if you do that with an instrumental piece, you'll be sorely disappointed because in an instrumental meaning and message aren't explicit. That's left up to you and I want to examine this difference through the song entitled five by Kendrick Lamar because there's a significant portion of the song that is an instrumental before Kendrick comes into rap, and this perfectly illustrates what is gained and lost when explicit meaning is given. In the beginning of this piece, we hear a jazz camp

Speaker 1:          01:09          on his own. We may call to mind a friend, a sunny day, the smell of espresso, a hipster coffee shop. We are free to give meaning, but this vanishes when Kendrick comes into rap because he begins to tell a story. I got 100 no, my dad's name in the grab bag in the trunk. So even though we gained something, when Kendrick comes in a clever story, different viewpoints, we also lose something. Whatever meeting to song could have helped to us after it's intended. Meaning is explicitly told. Now of course there's always room for some interpretation songs, but our interpretation has been limited. You're no longer in a coffee shop. You're in Kendrick's car. It's not a sunny day. It's raining God on the engine. This fed off in the brain, and this is how Kendrick Lamar can help us understand instrumentals through what we lose when he starts rapping, we lose focus on our own world, which is replaced with his, and there's nothing wrong with that. I myself love getting lost in Kendrick's vivid world. But if you understand this difference between songs and instrumentals, you may find the instrumentals can fill a gap. That song's camp songs for most people are too distracting for studying, having a conversation with someone or reading a book because they say too much. But instrumentals perfectly. Lay a mood without trudy. So assuming you don't already tried turning on an instrumental for a change and see how it affects you differently, construct your own meaning and message.
