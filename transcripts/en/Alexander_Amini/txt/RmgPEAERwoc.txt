Speaker 1:          00:00          I can't believe I'm saying this, but youtube has gotten stale lately. Youtube used to be the place to go to find cool, obscure videos by independent niche craters like this or this. It was basically the antithesis of cable tv where everything is sanitized and you know exactly what you're wanting to get. Youtube used to have an effect that I'd like to call it, they do to black hole where you get on to see a retina link video and find yourself three hours later watching windsurfing fails compilation number seven or the ultimate showdown of ultimate destiny. All through just clicking on related videos in the sidebar is a bit like going down the rabbit hole in Alice in wonderland, but youtube has made it harder to have this experience or finding fresh content. This is a screen capture of when I recently went to watch you Rhett and link video on this channel.

Speaker 1:          00:40          Look at the sidebar options, which should be the primary way to find new channels. The first page full is all written link and the few options that are different at the very bottom are channels that I already have subscribed to. There's absolutely nothing new to find here. How did this happen? Well, I did some digging and it has to do with the Youtube Algorithm. That's what determines what results or favorite show up when you search something. It's exact inner workings are more precious. That garden, the Krabby Patty formula, but people have been able to figure out pretty much how it works. A few years ago, youtube changes formula to favor watch time. In other words, they'd rather show you a video that will keep you on their site for 30 minutes. Then one that will keep you on for 10 minutes and that makes sense business wise, but it's also why it's so hard to find new channels on youtube.

Speaker 1:          01:21          Basically it comes down to this. Youtube wants to suggest videos that it knows you're already likely to enjoy, but the only thing it knows that you already liked is what you've already watched. This means it's only going to feed you more of the creators you already know and look, I'm fine with being shown more about subjects that I watch, but it seems like lately that's all youtube will recommend. We need a new way to discover videos and if any of you suggest the trending tab, I'll put you through that wall. It's just a bunch of TV, late night host movie trailers or other mass appeal videos. I don't need help finding the youtubers I already watched. I know who they are. I want to be able to find new creators I've never heard of. That's what made the youtube experience special. But Youtube needs to change its algorithm to take more risks with suggestions or we're going to all get tired of watching more of the same content he always watched. In summary, youtube, you're getting boring these days and it's time to spice things up. Yours conditionally theaudience. Hey, what's up guys, thanks for watching that video. Um, and you know, I think the best video, not the video that you found that you were looking for, but the one that you found that you weren't looking for, they're just right. So if you guys have had an experience like that, reasonably let me know. If you haven't, let me know. Thanks for watching. You can subscribe here. Watch another video here. And I will see you guys next Wednesday.
