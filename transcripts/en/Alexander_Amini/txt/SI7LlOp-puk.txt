Speaker 1:          00:00          If you had to bet on the next presidential election based on one trait, what would you pick? Wealth, hair, color, family history, illuminati membership size of their super pack, maybe size of their hands. Well, Professor Greg are. Marie has the answer to this in his paper on how physical traits affect our choices in leaders. Marie found that from 1789 to 2012, if you had bet on the taller candidate, you would have been right 58 percent of the time. That alone should probably be the end of the video. Fifty eight percent isn't insane. Advantage if you consider that height, has nothing to do with actual knowledge of how to run a country or foreign policy. So with that we should be able to exit out of this video. Sad that our elections have been so extensively hijacked by biological prejudices, but unfortunately it doesn't stop there because our data set isn't a complete picture yet.

Speaker 1:          00:44          Nobody decided their vote based on height before the television because they couldn't. They voted based only on what they heard from the radio and news only since 1960. And we had televised debates where the voters have been able to clearly tell who is color. So if we separate out these data sets into before television and after television, we find two things. First in the elections before 1960, our assumptions that they were unaffected by height turns out to be true. The odds of the taller candidate winning drops to 51 percent as we would expect if people not able to see their candidates before voting for them. Secondly, in our post television data set, our biological prejudices are worse than we thought. From 1960 to 2016, the taller candidate has won 67 percent of the time. Also, if one candidate is more than three inches taller than the other, their chances of winning go up to 83 percent.

Speaker 1:          01:31          Again, it's absolutely insane that height matters this much to our elections. But although this is a bit depressing, it is in line with what we know about behavioral psychology. There are many theories on why we like color leaders. Some studies say height is an advantage in fights because it means you're punching down, which generates more forced and makes you a better fighter and a primitive setting. This is how you would elect a leader. The strongest man would eventually win. Other theories suggest that we pick our leaders based on who we physically look up to. Think of when you're a child, your peers are always those who are generally around your height and the adults. The people who know stuff are the ones that are taller and bigger than you. It's possible that we never get rid of that bias when we grow up and see people who are taller as being authority figures, but no matter the explanation, one thing is clear. We want a leader who can draw the center of attention and dominate a room physically. We perceive them to be better suited for the job regardless of whether that is actually true or not. We always look to the tall guy, so if you want to know who the next president will be when the election cycle rolls around, again, it might be worth meeting the debate and just checking who is looking up to who.
