Speaker 1:          00:00          Okay. That was this one meeting of that the World Economic Forum, uh, conducts out of maybe 20 meetings during New Year around the world. But Davos is so called the annual meetings. So, uh, it is dinorah just of our meetings and it is the meeting which is attended by the highest level of the participants have a CEO's heads of state, academia, civil society, international organizations. Uh, and so every component of society is represented there. And the purpose is to talk about the major issues confronting us on a global basis.

Speaker 1:          01:06          I think the effects have been very, very positive because the forum promotes dialogue between various stakeholders that the form is, the form is just a platform that brings together people from all the components of society. It sit down around the table and talk about the issues. And that's pretty unique because in today's world it's hard to, uh, hard to achieve anything without gathering all the stakeholders together. It will achieve first understanding of the issues or awareness of some of the issues and the form positions itself as a catalyst to action. So we're not ourselves involved directly into doing something, but we are, uh, we are a catalyst throughout those dialogue, those discussions, those meetings, things come out of there are being put in place either directly by some of the participants or by a group of participants. We have meetings in, in Asia, we have meeting in Latin America and Africa and the Middle East in Europe, in the states. So, uh, and we have annual meetings with major one being that was the other one being in China every year. And really the whole world is represented as well as all, cause I said component society from everywhere. Yeah.
