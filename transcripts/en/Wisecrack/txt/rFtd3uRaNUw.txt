Speaker 1:          00:07          How do y'all jared? Here we are stupid, excited about red dead redemption. Two, so to celebrate it coming out, we wanted to break down numero uno and ask what does it all mean just like an older brother, grand theft auto grand theft horse takes a satirical look at American culture despite being set over a hundred years in the past, but above all else, red dead redemption is a commentary on our relationship to it, and if civilization was even worth all the trouble. So saddle up for this wisecrack edition on the satire of Red Dead Redemption and of course spoilers ahead for a game that's eight years old. First a quick shout out to our channel sponsor wicks and our last video I told you about some cool community stuff we're doing with their website building platform. Now we're happy to unveil our first site where you can vote on what we should cover in an upcoming episode of our movie podcast.

Speaker 1:          00:56          Show me the meaning. Stick around until the end to check it out. And now back to the show. To Recap, red dead redemption tells the story of John Marsden and Oge cowboy trying to become a productive member of society until it gets blackmailed by the government, forcing him to hunt down his former gang members Marston. Then Moses on down that lonesome trail into his past seeking redemption. See what you did though, Rockstar so he can get back to that simple farm life so far. Classic West, the game even uses all the classic cliches, expensive vistas, quickdraw, shootouts, literal cowboying, gambling, Mexican and native Americans getting shot by a dude called John and horse riding. Lots of horse riding. So with all this direct Oman, where does the satire come in? Like GTA? Much of red dead set higher comes from the game's huge cast of non playable characters who at first may seem like stock Western archetypes. There's Jenny, the good Christian girl in the opening scene,

Speaker 2:          01:52          do you, unless innocent receives communion, they're destined to go to him, hardly seems fair.

Speaker 1:          01:59          Or Sam Odessa, who's on a journey to the promised land of California or old Billy West, who asked you to collect flowers for his beloved wife, but whereas your traditional Western would use these tropes to tell wholesome tales of faith, hope or love, red dead redemption has other ideas. You leave Jenny to die of exposure out in the desert. Sand becomes a paranoid drunk and then you find his body torn apart by vultures. Oh, and billy's loving wife. You collected all those flowers for. She's actually a rotting corpse. Yes. You don't look a day over 30 ma'am. Or You have a character like Louisa and idealist with naive notions of a glorious revolution and a free Mexico who gets unceremoniously shot dead in the middle of a mission. And then the man she claims to be engaged to can't even remember her name was Shay is your peasant girl wife to be.

Speaker 1:          02:48          Oh yes, of course. She will have a day named after day that we said what? Oh yes. I knew it allowed as well. This puts rdr firmly in the camp of something we've talked about before. The Post Western, a kind of anti western that subverts the image of the old west as it's classically depicted, the game pits kind old men and young maidens against the harsh realities of the lawless west or feeling how easily these idealists in romantics were crushed by the brutality of the great western expansion, evenly twisted idealism of the tyrannical Mexican leader Colonel Again Day. Oh, I fight to help them find themselves to save them from themselves, ends rather abruptly, but as the characters who survive that provides the games most scathing satire. The characters that survive tend to be your allies and they will suck except Bonnie. She's fine, but the rest are largely selfish and unsympathetic.

Speaker 1:          03:44          Leading us to wonder who we're supposed to be rooting for. Most of them won't even assist you until they've been assisted by you. Take Marshall Johnson. He has some pretty fluid ideas on how to police the town of Armadillo in an early mission, hopefully call the political realities and Armadillo. He reveals a conflict of interests to put it lightly between public safety and big business. I've got the railway. The people are paying my salary, trying to get me to turn a blind eye to them, burned down settlements up there. You also is more than happy to turn a blind eye to crime outside my jurisdiction. That is until he owes you a favor. Then there's Mr. West Dickens, the snake oil salesman, businessman, and a harmless old fraud kind of man that built this country, a man who actively discourages people from acting selflessly and uses Marston to when horse racists and sell his tonic before lending a helping hand or professor McDougall, the anthropologist from an Ivy League school who also happens to be a racist cocaine addict whose theories on genealogy are constantly proven wrong.

Speaker 1:          04:43          It's remarkable. It completely refute my last book with allies like these were forced to ask who's the good guy? You've probably heard the phrase history is written by the victors and red dead redemption seems to agree the federal marshals like Johnson are ultimately the ones who tamed the wild west. Professor Mcdougall, who believed the native Americans to be barely human savages survives to bring these stories back to civilization where the decimation of native tribes continued for decades, Wild West Dickens, the entrepreneur and profiteer lives to sell another bottle of Elixir. These dick bags were the real champions of the wild west. The idealist die while the cunning shysters survive, such as rockstar satire of the old West as a post western red dead, not only satirizes the western genre, but the history of the West itself. The game takes place at the beginning of the 20th century when the old lawless west was dying, killed off by industrialization and urban development.

Speaker 1:          05:42          Federal law was growing to help police these newer states and the industrial revolution was finally catching up with western expansion. We'd like to think that this technological progress tamed the Wild West, but the game points out that it just brings its own flavor of violence. It gives you a railroad that you can take anywhere, but as Marshall Johnson points out, the owners burned down people's houses. You're also given an early machine gun twice that you use to gun down entire rvs. Not exactly your mythic cowboys, shootouts, but equally, if not more violent, but hey, new technology is awesome.

Speaker 3:          06:16          Socialization is a truly beautiful thing. Mr Marsden,

Speaker 1:          06:19          you end up with a pretty nuanced debate about the merits of civilization. Just as technology came to civilize the west, so did the government, which is similarly not given a flattering portrayal. For example, Abraham Reyes stages a coup against the dope, botched and cruel colonel. Again, day in Mexico before we meet him. Reyes is described as a heroic revolutionary leader of great moral work.

Speaker 3:          06:42          He doesn't care for the bourgeois snobbery or elitism

Speaker 1:          06:46          when we do meet him. However, he's a lying, arrogant, selfish womanizer who isn't stirring up revolution to free Mexico, but to get money in power with no intention of leading once it's attained

Speaker 3:          06:57          like any great leader, my brother I will delegate.

Speaker 1:          07:02          The other representative of government is Edgar Ross. You know the US official who has the backing of the US government so he can civilize the west. Well, he forces you to murder your former friends by stealing your family.

Speaker 4:          07:13          We need you to find them. Williamson then had to blackwater as quick as you can, and we have reason to believe that Dr van Dolson does in the area or your wife sends her regards

Speaker 1:          07:25          and when you accomplish your goal, since the entire army to your house to shoot you to pieces even says,

Speaker 4:          07:30          see we, me and archer, we're the bad guys. We enforce the rules.

Speaker 1:          07:38          This is a world where the good guys call themselves bad guys and the bad guys think they're good guys. So if the game is targeting the people who built the institutions that survive today, isn't that kind of bleak? Well, Rockstar may not be full of quite as many edge lords as it seems as their conclusion on the merits of civilization is quite complex. So sure, John Marsden and Co argue that while life is an outlaw is violent and often ugly, they are at least free, but the feds point out that the cowboys violence that comes from defending their freedom kinda sucks for everyone else.

Speaker 4:          08:13          I'll tell you what the alternative is. It's not complicated. It's about one man and his gun versus another man. Sure, civilization may be dull, but the alternative Mr Marsden is hell.

Speaker 1:          08:27          This bleak satire of society can be summed up in the chief antagonist of the game. Dutch band, Holland. Dutch is the former leader of Marston's old gang and the man you're sent to kill, but he isn't quite a classic Western billing. We hear from Marston how Dutch raised him.

Speaker 3:          08:42          Leader of the gang taught me how to read. He taught me how to see all that was good in the world. It was a great man in a way, and

Speaker 1:          08:49          whenever we meet Dutch, he's eloquent and honest. Violent, sure, but isn't everyone in this game. And then there's the fact that his new posse consists almost entirely of disenfranchised native Americans who see Dutch as a savior. The only native American character who talks to Marston and his allies is nastiness, is patronized and insulted by Professor Mcdougall and then shot in the head is a trader by his own people. Dutch is trying to stand against the march of the so called civilization of the West. That Marston's mission represents having seen what it does to people in their communities before Dutch dies. He says, when I'm gone, they'll do is find another monster.

Speaker 5:          09:27          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          09:29          because they have to justify their wages for Dutch. If you want an industrialized military with machine guns and motorcars, you need to justify that investment with an enemy to use it against, which makes his character of less an oblique satire and more of an on the nose commentary, seeing as it would only be three years later, that world war one would break out in red dead redemption, not only as our nostalgic view of the old west wrong, but so is the idea that the civilization that replaced it is somehow better. We're left with a world in which the crooked businessmen, selfish revolutionaries, morally bankrupt, academics and corrupt government officials are the ones laying the building blocks of the new world. While the selfless are forgotten. With this kind of pessimism running through the game, it's no wonder a key mantra throughout his

Speaker 5:          10:16          erase your past Mr. Marsden

Speaker 1:          10:19          and that

Speaker 5:          10:20          you can erase the past. Come won't make it go away

Speaker 1:          10:25          and

Speaker 5:          10:26          he's old. That's it. CanNot be nice.

Speaker 1:          10:30          Just as John can't escape his violent past, neither can America. Thanks for sticking around.
