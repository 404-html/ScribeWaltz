Speaker 1:          00:03          A wise crack, live action. Jared here these days, social media means everything we do ends up on permanent record. Just being on the Internet is a minefield and there's no survival guide for handling. We're not the only ones worrying about it either. As the newest episode of Southpark tackles these ideas head on. So let's get into this quick take on season 21 episode three holiday special. And as always, spoilers ahead if you've been listening to our ourself park podcast, respect our authortalk, you know that we've been fascinated by the fact that this season has been more focused on people's reaction to world events rather than the events themselves. This has never been more clear than in this past episode. Holiday Special Randy's quest for social justice hits a lot of ideas right on the nose, but it also raises some really interesting questions. First, a quick recap. Randy caught up and yet a nother wave of activism gets Columbus State canceled, which means no more day off school, but that's still not enough for south park's most vocal father.

Speaker 1:          01:07          He sets off to tear down a statue of Columbus, takes a crap and Columbus circle and berate the residents of Columbus, Ohio. You're an intolerant pig. Oh, you're not. You just choose to live in a city named for ethnic cleansing is activism keeps escalating until the kids discover a treasure trove of instagram. Pictures depicting randy in Columbus play. After that, randy goes to great lengths, including falsifying a DNA test in the randy way possible to inoculate himself against criticism by presenting himself as a native American, I. E. A descendant of Columbus. These victims. In the end, randy finds out that he's just an average white dude of European descent, but with more than average amount of neanderthal DNA, a fact he spins into his own story of victim hood. The earth wasn't big enough for the Andrew. Thoughts to your ancestors. Just got rid of them up after all those brutal homo sapiens for race neanderthals from the face of the earth.

Speaker 1:          02:02          So what does Randy's quest tell us about the world we live in? Well more than you might think and to explain why we're turning to something that we talked about in one of our walking dead videos. The pen off the con, the panopticon is an idea originally created by philosopher Jeremy Bentham. It's a prison where a single guard in a tower can watch all the inmates at once. The prisoners can't tell if they're being watched, so they have to always be on their best behavior. But postmodern theorists, Michel Foucault, thought it was a perfect metaphor for how society controls that citizens, because we never know when our actions might result in punishment. We try our best to follow the rules, which means we'd become controlled by those rules even when no one enforces them. We even internalize those rules and systems, so we don't know if we're acting because of our beliefs or because of that systemic control and fear of punishment.

Speaker 1:          02:52          Unfortunately for Randy, social media has become a kind of real life panopticon don't post that. Everything we do exist on the Internet for forever and because of that, we all have to be careful with what we do and what we say online. Randy feels this in a very real way. When the kids discover his prior predilection for Columbus because he's always being watched, randy has internalized his fear of punishment and his desire to live up to social ideals as a means of creating social capital. You guys found those pictures online. It's only a matter of time before everyone else does. People won't care about what I do now. They'll just see me as a thoughtless indigenous son of a bitch. In other words, as a perpetual band wagoner, randy needs to be a guy who protest Columbus because that's what he thinks society wants from him, but with the advent of the Internet, he's constantly terrified of what his peers might uncover about his past.

Speaker 1:          03:44          Once the points Sharon, soon they're going to become an afternoon. With social media, our culture is evolving faster than ever, but it's also becoming or judgmental mistakes made in the past are looked at through the lens of the present. Just because he's suddenly not cool now doesn't mean I'm going to be the scape goat. This goes for both Columbus who definitely did horrible things and randy, who's just kind of an idiot. It's only now when everyone's being so indigenous to me that I realized how indigenous I've been acting all along. Randy tries to explain that he's changed that what he did in the past shouldn't matter. Look, I was younger, we were all young. There was another time you have to understand it was 2013 two bad for randy. There's no codified statue of limitations on bad behavior. Randy gets caught acting in the past with ways not entirely kosher with the present.

Speaker 1:          04:36          He can't be an advocate for a cause. If he's seen as disingenuous and sends, Randy defines himself by his project of the week. He can't afford to let that happen and because social media judges all action, we often fetishize purity when it comes to social issues. Yeah. How I'm from New York, I drive around a big circle that celebrates a guy who murdered native Americans. Luckily for Randy, he stumbles across the commercial for appears to be a perfect solution. DNA in me. Wouldn't you like to know the story of you? What makes you you? The DNA testing program lets people claim affinity with marginalized groups. I'm on cell part, northern Asian and even some Kurdish. I'm a victim of oppression. Even if they aren't apparently a part of them DNA and be showed I was 8% Navajo, nobody making fun of me. Now are my people who are victims.

Speaker 1:          05:25          The ability to claim victim hood enables people to stake out a moral high ground and make themselves immune from criticism. Are you in health? Yes, I'm in. Now the irony of this is a course that most people who need a DNA test to find out if they're victims of oppression probably are not oppressed. I'm 13% victim. I'm 21% victim to protect himself from potential fallout. Randy pays a native American to make out with him in order to guarantee he'll end up with the DNA of an indigenous person. In doing this, randy demonstrates and indifference toward the feelings of the native American man who ends up falling in love with him. I have never felt so alive and tone and even managers to recreate the misdeeds of Columbus all over again. You get off my land, you'll pay. This all adds up to show that randy's political aspirations are ultimately selfish.

Speaker 1:          06:15          He's so desperate to claim victim hood and so utterly ill informed about pretty much everything that he leans on his 2.8% neanderthal DNA. They claim that his people were erased from history. Yeah, sure. Everyone gang up on the neanderthal visited. Funny again, Randy's bizarre behavior raises something important. How do we decide when people can claim victim hood? That's not to minimize the suffering of anyone, but how do we distinguish between people who are legitimately effected by a legacy of oppression and this guy, I used to get in trouble for always using the n word, but with DNA and me, I found out that I'm 2.1% black morning Steve, stop. Where's the line? How close do you need to be on the family tree for oppression to be passed down? Certainly a thousand years is too much, but what about a hundred years or 50 years? Even five. It's a complicated debate, but we know exactly what randy thinks even tens of thousands of years is fair game.

Speaker 1:          07:13          All these ideas add up to one compelling 20 minute critique of how we approach politics in the age of social media. Questions of how we deal with our public lives being saved online, how we treat past mistakes and how we understand victimhood in our hyper aware era are ones that we need to answer and South Park knows that until we resolve all of that, there'll be a whole lot of misguided randy's running around and causing chaos. That's what the show is ultimately saying. We need to figure out how we talk to each other about history and complicated ideas of culture or else we'll just be crossing wires, making messes and in public places. The 21st season of south park wants us to think how we handle an increasingly complicated world that demands faster and less nuanced reactions. You have to Overdo it in today's society, Stan, you can't be nuanced and subtle anymore else. Critics go, wow, what was the point of that? The show doesn't have answers though and neither do we, but the first step is asking questions. If you want to hear these questions explored further, check out our south park podcast.
