Hey wisecrack, jared here would be imminent release of the avengers infinity war. We thought we'd go back and take a look at the civil war.

Speaker 2:          00:17          Nope,

Speaker 1:          00:17          not that one. This one

Speaker 2:          00:21          now

Speaker 1:          00:21          on its face, civil war is a two hour spectacle of biceps chases, mandatory character introductions to feed the mcu and man, you know, he lifts, but in addition to some good old fashioned fisticuffs civil war also explores the idea of global fisticuffs or international relations as you may know it. Which brings us to the question, what do superpowers like the United States have to learn from Tony Stark or Steve Rogers? Welcome to this wisecrack condition on the philosophy of Captain America civil war. Don't forget to subscribe if you haven't already and has always spoilers ahead. While the civil war comics Uris deals with issues like privacy and domestic policing in the wake of the Patriot Act, the film makes an ambitious break with its source material. Instead, it focuses on a conflict between two approaches to international relations, civil war frames. The conflict between Captain America and iron man is a battle between two opposing views on the avengers role in the world.

Speaker 1:          01:14          Specifically, the film asks, should a US based high powered and potentially destructive team like the avengers be allowed to operate internationally independent of government oversight? It's a poignant question to ask, especially in the wake of America's own questioning of its interventionism abroad in civil war. This question comes to a head in the debate over the Sokovia accords. The accords claim the avengers have no right to cross national borders and fight. They're highly destructive battles without the approval of all governments concerned. Their argument is grounded in the notion of Westphalian sovereignty. The idea that a nation state is an ought to be in charge of all affairs within its borders. This modern notion of sovereignty only came to exist in 1648 after the major European powers were tired of fighting either the 30 years' war or eight years war, which unlike the liar, seven years' war actually lasted for as long as advertise the resulting peace of Westphalia created the idea of sovereignty that we understand today, but in our highly globalized modern world, things are a little more complicated than when people were still charging into battle on horseback.

Speaker 1:          02:17          Many contemporary political commentators are all about the idea of a post Westphalian world order. They argued that globalization has broken down traditional ideas of who holds power were under this system. Independent actors such as private corporations and terrorist cells are able to wield as much or sometimes more power than the nation states whose borders they cross at will. In the film, the avengers are portrayed as a product of this post Westphalian world. There are a group of US based superhumans who go wherever they want, whenever they want, without the permission of local governments. The film even emphasizes this modern notion of the avengers in its opening where our heroes tried to catch a former hydra agent while using the language of a police operation complete with drones and calls for backup

Speaker 3:          03:01          Sam. We need fire and rescue and the south side of the building.

Speaker 1:          03:07          However, they function less like a traditional police force and more like a private security company. If like main villain, Zemo your family happens to be the one that gets blown up in their latest attempt at saving the world, you might even consider them terrorists.

Speaker 3:          03:19          What would you call a group of us based enhanced individuals who routinely ignore sovereign borders and inflict their will wherever they choose and who frankly seemed unconcerned about what they leave behind.

Speaker 1:          03:35          The sokovia accords then are the Westphalian world dealing with post Westphalian realities. The debate over the accords is grounded in two competing views of how the international arena works. Realism and liberalism realism argue that states are self interested. Power seeking rational actors who seek to maximize their security and chances of survival. Liberalism, stresses, interdependence among states, multinational corporations and international institutions arguing that these various actors can and should work together for the benefit of all the Sokovia accords fit this liberalist paradigm to a tea under the new rule set out in the accords. Government actors I. E. The UN will work together with nongovernmental forces. In this case, the avengers for the presumed common good. This means more rules and greater oversight for the avengers who will no longer be able to gallivant around the globe fighting whenever and wherever they please compromise

Speaker 3:          04:30          reassurance. That's how the world works.

Speaker 1:          04:32          Tony Stark buys into the accords liberalist framework but still manages to do plenty of Gallo vantage.

Speaker 3:          04:38          He seriously thinking, listen to you after this fiasco and Leipzig,

Speaker 1:          04:42          you are used that cooperation with sovereign governments even to the point of accepting the imposed limitations is crucial for stark respect for the interdependent world order is part of what separates the avengers from the terrorist groups. They fight.

Speaker 3:          04:55          We need to be put in check whatever form that takes. I'm game. If we can't accept limitations were boundaryless. We're no better than the bad guys.

Speaker 1:          05:03          Steve Rogers, on the other hand, is a realist. He's focused on security and his own agenda first and foremost, and argues against the Sokovia cords on the grounds that they will make the avengers less able to respond to critical situations, thereby putting the world in danger. If we call Tony, hi, you won't believe even if he did, who knows if the accords or let them know we're on our own. While the real, his position allows for cooperation that will increase the likelihood of the world survival. Captain America is simply unconvinced that this cooperation will improve security for anyone. Steve argues that the shifting agendas of those who uphold the accords could lead to compromise security down the line.

Speaker 3:          05:41          This is the United Nations we're talking about. It's not the World Security Council. It's not shield. It's not hydro, but it's run by people with agendas and agendas

Speaker 1:          05:49          change. The film asked some pretty heavy questions that may as well be directed at a modern superpower. Is unfettered power inherently dangerous? Do rules only tie up crucial fighting forces in dangerous amounts of red tape? Instead of providing some black and white answer for an insanely complex question, the film offers us some ambiguity. While one may criticize captain America for his unilateral approach to solving things,

Speaker 3:          06:12          stop telling you anything else that you'll wrong. You think you're right, it makes you dangerous.

Speaker 1:          06:18          You could equally say the same of Tony Stark as he tries to enforce the Sokovia accords leading to plenty of collateral damage along the way while exploring these international frameworks. The film also explores how personal ethics can complicate these concepts. When a terrorist blows up the UN killing black panthers father, he goes on the hunt for presumed culprit bucky barnes. The attack on the UN creates a riff between those vendors who want the government to take in bucky and those who believed. Captain America's right to attempt his own rescue. Where this conflict, the film asks us to consider whether it's better to act based on a preconceived set of moral obligations like the captain's obligation to Bucky or with consideration for the greater good like stark and his compatriots, Tony Stark in his gang and body branch of philosophy known as Utilitarianism, which holds that actions should be judged based on their overall consequences rather than on their adherence to abstract ideals. Tony Stark believes that oversight will reduce the amount of collateral damage caused by their activities and that this is reason enough to support the Sokovia courts above and beyond his belief in the usefulness of a liberalist world order. Tony Stark's supports the accords because they align with his own utilitarian conception of morality. These two ideas are different though not necessarily contradictory. While he knows that the new rules will inconvenience him and his team, he's convinced that they will improve the lot of humanity as a whole. It's not about his personal convictions, it's about the greater good.

Speaker 3:          07:40          Captain Rogers, I know you believe what you're doing is right, but for the collective good, you must surrender. Now,

Speaker 1:          07:49          Captain America, on the other hand, flirts with an ethical position known as deontology. Deontology judges the morality of an action itself without consideration for the affects that said action might have, again, not contradictory to his real as beliefs, but different nonetheless from a deontological perspective, certain actions can never be justified. No matter how much they might promote some greater good like killing an innocent person, even if it could save millions more. While Steve Rogers isn't they perfect deontologist in the sense of Oh gee deontologist Emmanuelle con, he acts according to personal laws rather than universal ones. He bases his actions around a set of moral duties. CAPP believes that his moral duty to save his friend Bucky Barnes trumps whatever greater good might be served by his death or imprisonment. No matter how many cops bucky happens to beat the piss out of it in the films closing minutes, we learned that all the carnage, betrayal and heartbreak we've followed for the last two hours is the secret plan of former Sokovia in special operatives, Zemo whose loved ones were more collateral damage of the avengers, Zemo or feels that it was his plan all along to tear the vendor's apart.

Speaker 1:          08:55          Showing Tony Stark footage of bucky barnes murdering his parents. [inaudible] bites enemies can rise again. The line was crumbles from within.

Speaker 3:          09:07          That's that

Speaker 1:          09:09          forever and here I think the film suggests a failing all these philosophical systems, no matter how right participants in these systems believe they are, there will always be somebody who gets the shaft. Tony Stark is confronted by the mother of one of the many eggs he had to crack in order to make a superhero omelet. Who's going to avenge my son's stark? He's dead and I blame you. She is essentially in the same camp as Zemo. Whether you're operating for the greater good, your personal ethics at the behest of your own country or an international agreement. There's always a Zemo that loses out. And that's the problem with the force. As powerful as the avengers, as division says, I'll very strength invites challenged. Challenge, insights, conflict.

Speaker 3:          09:56          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          09:57          Conflict

Speaker 1:          10:00          breeds catastrophe. Someone is always going to get shafted by these philosophical systems, but when the team doing the shafting has the collective force of a nuclear superpower, the forces that challenged them, we'll invite equally destructive force and that can turn out pretty poorly for the world. So what do you think are the avengers right to agree to the accords? Should captain America give up his own code for the greater good or are there just no right answers?
