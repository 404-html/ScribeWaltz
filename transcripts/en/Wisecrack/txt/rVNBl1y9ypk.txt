Disembodied, jared again, man, the DCEU has had a pretty rough go of it. We've already broken down what went wrong in Batman v Superman and suicide squad, but today we're going back to the source of all these issues. The movie that began Zack Snyder's vision of the DC universe that gave birth to mustache gape, tramp stamp, joker, Momoa, dead eyes. Wonder woman. Okay, that one was pretty great. They never ending, will they or won't they all ultimately leading to the tragically bland corporate mandated void that is the justice league. But none of this would exist if it weren't for the film that set the tone man of steel by trying to graph darkness and grit onto a character devoid of such qualities, man of steel stumbles into a mess that would ultimately doom the DCEU.

Speaker 1:          00:54          So let's rotate the earth back half a decade and see how the Dcu went so wrong. So early. Welcome to this wisecrack addition on man of steel. What went wrong, and as always spoilers ahead. Back in 2013 DC films was riding high after the critical and financial success of Christopher Nolan's dark knight trilogy. Those films successfully merge the pop aesthetic of a superhero film with a previously unmatched sense of weight. No one explored. The darker aspects of being the Batman questioning whether the vigilante himself was a destructive force, did Batman beak in the very cycle of violence he fights against with the joker, Bain, and all the rest of these villains ever have come to fruition if he didn't exist. If true, what good is Batman are suppose it hero? Is he a necessary evil? These are weighty questions to ask. And yet the dark knight trilogy never tipped over into pump hostility.

Speaker 1:          01:46          The rare superhero films to be both smart and entertaining. It's no surprise then that DC wanted to recreate this same success with their other tentpole comic character, Superman. I mean those Christopher Nolan Batman films. Sure we're successful. So why not do the exact same thing for superman? Seems like a sure fire hit. What could go wrong? So the powers that be hired, another dark and gritty filmmaker, watchman in 300 Zack Snyder brought in the co writer of the Dark Knight Trilogy and even gave our boy Nolan a story credit and producer role. There's just one little problem. Superman isn't that feed darkness and weight intrinsic to Batman and emotionally scarred vigilante avenging the death of his parents just isn't true for Superman. On the contrary, Superman is supposed to be the ideal, all powerful, yet completely pure. There's not a malevolent bone in his body. He's the ultimate good guy.

Speaker 1:          02:38          So how the hell do you impose darkness, grit, and weight onto the symbol of hope on my world? It means hope for Snyder. The answer didn't lie with Superman, but in the world around him, America has changed a whole lot since Superman's comic book introduction in 1938 where once upon a time the good guys and bad guys were easy to deduce and label. At the time, man of steel was written. The endless war on terror had muddied the waters, one ton of obey Sinophobia and insufficient veteran services. Painting America as a far cry from the supposed shining city on a hill man of steel. Questions. If Superman, the embodiment of the American ideal can survive in the current disillusioned America, will he be accepted or rejected? Ostensibly, it's a coming out story where this central question becomes, should superman revealed himself to society and lest anyone ever accused man of steel of being subtle. When Clark first discovers his powers during class, he runs away and hides out in, you guessed it, a closet. So what answer does the film provide? Should Superman remain in the closet or reveal his powers and save the world like the hero he's always been? Well, the answer becomes far darker and murkier than you'd expect after young Clark saves a bus full of students from drowning. Jonathan Kent tells him that maybe he shouldn't have. What was I supposed to do?

Speaker 2:          03:59          Just let him die.

Speaker 3:          04:06          Maybe

Speaker 1:          04:06          let that sink in. The All American dad tells the burgeoning hero he should probably just let a bunch of children drown. The crazier part man of steel treats us advice as sound. Jonathan in the same scene tells Clark that there's more at stake than the lives of a bunch of children in the world finds out what you can do. It's going to change everything or

Speaker 2:          04:26          our beliefs or our notions of what it means to be human. Everything.

Speaker 1:          04:31          Jonathan fears that when confronted with WHO and what Clark is, people will fear and reject him. Humanities, very reality will shatter and the results won't be pretty, and guess what? Throughout man of steel, we see this to be exactly the case. When Clark hides in the closet after discovering his powers, he hears the children afraid of him. When Perry Mason, here's about the possibility of Superman's existence. He remarks. Can you imagine how people on this planet would react? They knew there was someone like this out there, even lowest lane. Superman's true. Paramour is afraid when she first sees the Almighty alien.

Speaker 2:          05:15          The questions raised by my rescuer. Subsistence are frightening to contemplate.

Speaker 1:          05:19          If Clark does decide to come out, well, it could end in his death. Case in point as a teenager, Clark is framed reading a book on the philosopher Plato. Plato actually detailed. What would happen if a perfectly just and righteous man were to ever come into the world. A man just like Superman in the republic, one of Socrates's pals suggest that this perfect van, we'll be scourged. Rack bound, evil of his eyes burned out and it lasts after suffering every kind of evil he will be impale so not good. If Superman were to reveal his identity and notably people would turn against him and seek to kill him. A fake. We see play out in v Superman. Snyder drives this point home by comparing the hero to the other. All good being in human history. Jesus was an act of God. Jonathan, this was providence when Clark debates with, they preached about whether he should reveal his identity.

Speaker 1:          06:12          He's framed in the foreground, would they stained glass depiction of Jesus in the background and later when Superman rescues lowest from an escape pod, we see him in the classic crucifixion pose. Again, not very subtle by comparing superman with Christ snider as a real sense of foreboding to man of steel because well, we all know how Jesus's story ends and here in lies the problem. Clark has to become superman because the movie's called man of steel, not hipster, sad beard man, but man of steel puts itself into a corner where it's constantly arguing. Clark shouldn't reveal his powers, that if he does become superman, you will be feared, hated, and inevitably murdered. There's no logical reason for Clark to reveal himself to the world. So this leads to two issues. One, Clark becomes a reluctant hero and to the entire film becomes a refusal of the call.

Speaker 1:          07:02          Now, the reluctant hero is a well worn narrative archetype in which a person is thrust into circumstance where he must save the day despite never really wanting to do so. Think Han Solo in star wars or John mcclane in die hard. This hero doesn't ever look to save anybody. He's just drawn into situations where he must. Similarly, Clark doesn't look to save anybody in man of steel. He just sort of ends up at the right place at the right time. The school bus crash, well, Clark's already on the bus, so why not the oil rig disaster Clarkson in nearby fishing boat. So why not? Again, lowest gets attacked by a tentacle that just sketch Clark's only a couple feet away. You get the point. But this reluctant hero archetype is the antithesis of the superman myths. If Superman is the ideal, we strive to be the hero among heroes. Then his reluctance to save anybody runs contrary to his ethos.

Speaker 1:          07:53          Further by making superman a reluctant hero, it turns him into a passive character. Things happen to Clark. The bus crashed the oil rig disaster or a stage five tornado as opposed to Clark leading the narrative through action. The entire film in turn becomes a refusal of the call for Joseph Campbell's Hero's journey. When our hero is first called into action, he chooses to refuse often because staying at home is easier and far less dangerous. For example, in Star Wars, a new hope luke initially refuses to help Obiwan safe Princess Leia. It's only when Luke returns home to see his house destroyed and his aunt and uncle dead that he decides to take up action. The refusal of the call is typically only a brief stop on the hero's journey and Campbell's monomyth. It takes up less than a 17th of the hero's journey. Get in man of steel.

Speaker 1:          08:41          Clark refuses the call to become superman for over half the film more than an hour of runtime. Imagine if luke had spent over an hour contemplating the pros and cons of using the force you'd grow to hate the guy. This becomes the problem. Man of steel. Clark spends so much time debating the merits of becoming a hero that in the end he seems like a bit of a Dick. I mean, he's an almighty, all powerful being who can save the earth on one leg with only his pinkie, and yet we the audience are as to sympathize with why he shouldn't save anybody. When Jonathan Ken gets sucked up into a tornado, man of steel's intent is to depict the moment as a tragic lesson, but in execution, well, it's far less. Clark could save his Paul from imminent death but can't because doing so would reveal his powers to too many. I let my father die

Speaker 2:          09:32          because I trusted him because he was convinced that I had to wait at the world is not ready

Speaker 1:          09:41          yet. Again, man of steel treats this as a completely reasonable action, like of course that's what anyone would do. Superman's just let us father die because there's at least 25 people under the bridge watching even more. The blame is placed on the world. It's our fault. Jonathan Kent died. We're to ennoble, not the superhero that could've saved him in. Oh, I don't know, two seconds. Man of steel carries the cynicism to its conclusion where superman in Zod duke it out in metropolis, nonchalantly killing hundreds of thousands if not more, but it's not superman who is cavalier to this loss of life, but the film itself, man of steel doesn't realize the implication this conclusion has on superman and his heroic ethos. The ending has treated it as a triumph superman, defeat sod and saves the world. Who cares about a couple hundred thousand extras? Lois is fine. Get over it. Humanity never even accept superman. After Clark reveals his powers and sorta saves metropolis. The government tracks in with a drone questioning his motives. How do we know you're woke one day? Act against America's interests. Superman two doesn't trust humanity. Destroying the Afa mentioned drone and telling the government to take a hike that they'll never find out where he hangs his cake. So in the end, the uneasy relationship between humanity and superman is still well exactly that the world's still isn't ready. Early in man of Steel Clarksburg, Father Jarell echoes the idealistic sentiments of Superman's past.

Speaker 3:          11:06          You will give the people of, uh, an ideal to strive tool. All right behind you that will stumble fall, but in time they will join you in the Sun Gow and time it will help them accomplish one.

Speaker 1:          11:29          This is the Superman of the 1930s of Richard Donner and Christopher Reed. But the words ring hollow in Snyder's morally obfuscated worldview. By the end of man of steel. Snyder has crafted a superman who shouldn't have saved a bus full of children who let his father die and destroyed the city. He sought to protect all the idealism of yesteryear has been sucked out. Leaving a hollow shell were one stood beacon of hope. Man of steel's intent is to pave the way for Superman and the Dcu to showcase the uplifting origins of the greatest of heroes and begin a multi crossover film franchise. But in reality, the film has the exact opposite reaction, the wanton destruction of the third act, the wishy washy hero, the morally obfuscated world, all paint a picture far from idealistic. This isn't an uplifting story of a hero coming into his own and being accepted by the world.

Speaker 1:          12:21          This is a story of a hero being forced into hiding, ultimately rejected in fear by the government and the people he seeks to protect that darkness and grit the very thing man of steel ads, ironically enough becomes its own undoing, swallowing up the inherent goodness of its central character, turning the beginnings of the Dcu franchise into the origins of its end.
