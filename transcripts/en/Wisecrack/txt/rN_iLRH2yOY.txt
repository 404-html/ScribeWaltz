Speaker 1:          00:03          Hey, wise crack jared, as always, so ubisoft recently reached out to us about doing something for the newly remastered version of assassin's creed rogue for ps four and xbox one. Luckily for them, we've gotten a lot of assassin's creed requests over the years and luckily for us, rogue has a unique perspective on the eternal struggle between the assassins and the templars and how it relates to the complicated nature of freedom throughout the series. The value of freedom is placed above all else. How are we in shall freedom public human race, the assassins were told are fighting the good fight against those devious 10 players who are trying to rule the world with an iron fist. While freedom is nearly universally celebrated in society and Media Qb legally safe. William Wallace knockoff.

Speaker 2:          00:45          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:47          Through which protagonists Shay Cormac, assassin's creed rogue asked an interesting and unique question. When does freedom go too far? Welcome, Liz. Wise, crack condition on assassin's creed, rogue remastered, and as always, minor spoilers ahead. First, a quick recap rope takes place around the numerically challenged seven years war and somewhere between black flag and assassin's creed. Three, we follow fledgling assassin. Shay Cormac, a troublemaker who begins to question the assassin brotherhoods, methods, guards watching

Speaker 3:          01:15          to his dad looked disappointed, sick of the way that looks it would have been dead in a month. Anyway,

Speaker 1:          01:25          he continues to struggle with defending his creed until halfway through the game. He's given an assignment to find a piece of ed or an ancient objects had to bestow God like power and wisdom because pieces of Eden, a powerful relics. When Shay tries to retrieve it, he triggers the infamous Lisbon earthquake of 1755 that killed thousands. Despite what's happened in Haiti, happened in Portugal or greater earthquake. Thousands, he confronts the assassins who deny culpability for the earthquake, even though they were aware of the same thing, had caused the devastating earthquake in Puerto Prince five years earlier. She argues that over here to this side, what city funds decks, but the assassin say we have the responsibility, so shay flees the Brotherhood. After being injured in his escape, he's nurse back to health by an elderly couple who turned out to be templars. Shay is then recruited by the temp lars and send to kill his former assassin.

Speaker 1:          02:20          Brethren, in most assassin's creed games were told the templars are evil because they oppose freedom and the assassins are good because they fight for freedom, which is best embodied in their mantra, but assassin's creed rogue by showing the inner workings of both sides explores the paradoxical nature of freedom and the shortcomings of the assassins belief system. Sure, the assassin seen noble. I mean after all, you don their mantle as you fight against the corruption of the church and histories other bad guys, but just how benign is the saying when you consider the events of rogue, the assassins disposition toward absolute freedom starts looking a bit questionable. We can best understand why through the concept of positive freedom, positive freedom is the freedom to do something and to self determine what that something is. It's the freedom to choose to blast weird German techno whenever you want.

Speaker 1:          03:14          That's different than negative freedom. The freedom from certain external forces like the freedom from your roommate, Brad telling you to stop blasting German techno at 2:00 AM or brad common during your stereo. The problem with unlimited freedom is that it often comes in conflict with the rights and freedoms of others. While you may be the master of your own fate, what if your actions limit the freedom of others? What if Brad can't be the master of his own destiny because he hasn't gotten any sleep after the unceasing onslaught of Autobahn every night until 2:00 AM, and if you reject any limitations on freedom from outside interferences or negative freedom, who's going to step in to help Brad get some sleep? If everything is permitted, then people might not agree with when and how I want to listen to music. The temple ours address this problem of freedom.

Speaker 1:          04:01          By negating it all together, they in essence don't believe in the value of positive freedom. That people can make their own decisions or negative freedom, that they should be free from despotic control. Their philosophy is essentially that the freedom of one person will always end up rubbing against someone else's, and so such freedom must be restricted. Philosopher Isaiah Berlin highlights one way in which these self determination of positive freedom can have horrific results. Freedom for Berlin can often be defined collectively with others groups, tribes, or even nations can set out to define their own destiny, and that's where things get a little tricky. Since in the name of collective freedom, many have decided to repress minority groups. The German people collectively yearned for the freedom to determine their national destiny, but well, we all know how that turned out for certain groups in Europe. Now obviously the assassins and the Nazis are about as similar as Mozart and Fred Durst, but the assassins are willing to sacrifice the freedom of some for the sake of freedom for everybody.

Speaker 1:          05:04          If we're all free to do whatever the hell we want and the assassins don't mind. Earthquakes killing thousands then is absolute freedom. Really the ultimate good. The templar seemed to understand this problem with positive freedom with people being their own masters, so they try to actively suppress it. In the name of a better world, what marvelous destruction captain, I saw the smoke all the way from the Morrigan that should discourage those Miss Greens. New Yolk is safe for now and as rogue shows, they're not as misguided as one may think. Paradoxically, certain rights and freedoms can be enhanced with a heavy hand from say the government or the templars. So for instance, by limiting someone's freedom to enslave another person, logging in states a better version of freedom, not predicated on owning other humans. We see this conundrum in other assassin's creed games such as black flag where the British templarios cracked down the pirates.

Speaker 1:          05:57          You play as in the name of safer sees and liberty for woodby pirate victims. The templars believe they know best and that order can be achieved through guidance and rule. But this isn't exactly a perfect ideology either. The total control of individuals for the sake of greater good can lead to your typical big brother Dystopian nightmare. So while causing earthquakes, stealing fortunes and slitting throats is okay. If nothing is the polar opposite is that we should all be thanking our masters for living under a Jack boot, but hey police, they're open about it. What makes rogue unique is that shade distances himself from the dogmatic belief structures that characterize the protagonists of previous games and embraces a rationally informed moral choice, but the shea make the right choice. Well to figure that out. We'll need help from one of the big dogs of the European Enlightenment Manual Count during the enlightenment, formulated a way to ground morality in reason instead of religion or custom known as the categorical imperative.

Speaker 1:          06:57          So let's see how Shay's decision stacks up. The first formulation act only according to that maxim whereby you can will that it should become a universal law sort of boils down to do unto others. So if you want to know if killing people and then searching their bodies for loot is moral, you should consider what will happen if everyone follows this rule. The second is to act in such a way that you treat humanity never merely as a means to an end, but always at the same time. As an end. This essentially means that life is the highest value in and of itself, so never harm others or exploit them as a means of achieving some bigger goal. The final rule says that the will of every rational beings should be thought of as a universally legislating will. This ties the first two together and suggest that there is a universal reason or logic that we can all access through our own rationality.

Speaker 1:          07:48          It also offers a framework that includes a sense of freedom since every person is capable of participating in this kind of moral reasoning where without the dangers of the templars of the assassins, where people become freedom list ponds to their grander plans. Even if paradoxically freedom is part of that grander plan. According to current, no action or morals are ethical if they contradict these three rules. So let's see how shay scores against the assassins shade defects because he believed that by causing an earthquake and justifying it as part of their responsibility, the assassins have done a grave injustice. This act violates the first formulation because it implies killing thousands for your own end, which could never be a universal ethical act. One point for Shay, zero for the assassin's the assassin's are also saying that those lives are acceptable sacrifices for their greater goal, a violation of the second principle, because using people as a means to an end is a big no, no.

Speaker 1:          08:45          Another point for Shay, and finally through their belief in total freedom, the assessments are trampling on people's legislative will by ignoring their own agency and literally destroying their homes and autonomous lives which contradicts const. Third formulation. Shay wants no part of it, so three points for Shay, zero for the assassins. So what can we learn from shades decision that fighting for freedom is not so simple by pursuing their own freedom, the assassins have destroyed the freedoms of others, but by rejecting the indoctrinated philosophy of nothingness, Jay could be among the few ethical heroes of the assassins creed franchise. Unfortunately for Shay, the temple, ours aren't exactly model citizens either in the name of regulating freedom for the greater good, the templars do plenty of deplorable things. We see them helping local people in various places. Now, let us use some of that money for the good of the city and stopping the assassins from committing what amounts to a war crime.

Speaker 1:          09:45          There is an abandoned factory nearby, how dangerous poison, but we also see them lie, maim and kill in the name of their own creed. In the end, the same sense of moral dubiousness follows the templars as much as the assassins. When I am issued new recruits burdened with regrets, I tell them the surest way to lose them. He's with gunpowder with them both contradicting constant parative by using people as a means to their own ends and killing those who stand in their way. Assassin's creed rogues more nuanced exploration of freedom, good and evil is a welcome addition to the series Shay's decision to betray the assassins, brings the philosophies of both factions under scrutiny and makes the player view each in an entirely new life. Was this moral ambivalence about freedom always there. Have we been playing as the bad guys? All along, here's to hoping. This complex question gets explored in future installments, but until then, be sure to check out the remastered version of assassin's creed rogue out now on xbox one and ps four.
