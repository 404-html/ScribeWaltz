Speaker 1:          00:05          Hey guys, so this is the launch of the first wisecrack pilot for 2018. We've got a couple of them in the works. We will work really hard on him, but most importantly we want to know what you guys think, so let us know what you think in the comments and enjoy the show.

Speaker 2:          00:20          Sometimes it's the details of a film that matter most likely a single shot, a needle drop. I see a little line of dialogue is looking at your kid a sudden cut what seemed like insignificant choices often say more in under 20 seconds than other films say into ours. In this new format, we'll be studying these seemingly trivial pieces revealing how even the smallest elements can bring layers of meaning to a piece of art. Welcome to wise cracks the film, the wolf of Wall Street

Speaker 3:          00:55          and sell me this pen,

Speaker 2:          01:02          the closing shot of the wolf of Wall Street. This pen works and I just used simple push in and crane up. Well, what if I told you this shot changes the meaning of the entire film? This pen works and I personally, as a client describes the pin, is voice drowns out and solemn music kicks in. Up to this point, the film is utilized, poppy, upbeat, hits to underscore the debauchery,

Speaker 4:          01:33          the amnesia phase,

Speaker 2:          01:41          so why the sudden shift to something more serious and meditative. For most of its three hour run time, the wolf of Wall Street revels in Jordan Belfort's access his yacht, his women, his drugs, his parties, the lifestyle paid for by defrauding investors. That is until the FBI circles in seizing Belfort's cash and sending them away to prison for four years, but unlike similar films where the corrupt Wall Street broker gets locked up and justice is served, the wolf of Wall Street is absent any overt moralizing Belford prison time is a cakewalk and he doesn't even serve his full sentence. In the end, nothing has changed. Belfort to still selling and the people well, they're still buying, but this is just the tip of the iceberg. The final shot can be interpreted in a number of ways, but here are our three favorites. One, the final shot holds up a mirror to us movie goers. Viewing the film, notice there's eight backlight behind the seminar that evokes a projector shining on the back of an audience. So what does this mean? Well, it may be easy to lay the blame solely on Jordan for all the moral depravity,

Speaker 4:          02:51          wolf of Wall Street,

Speaker 2:          02:57          but perhaps the final shot, the blame not only on Belford, but on us and the culture that allows and encourages his behavior. He divorced me, but yeah, let's do it. Early on, Belford says, we person you're on the phone with, they want to get rich and they want to get rich quickly. They don't want something familiar. We may feel dignified because we're not crawling on the ground on quileutes, but truth is Jordan scam wouldn't work if we didn't share his dream of getting rich quickly, wanting something or nothing. Y'all want to be just like him. Scorsese is essentially calling us out. We've just spent three hours partying with laughing and reveling in his experts. It's no wonder Jordan doesn't suffer any punishments in the end because after all, we revel in everything he does. Living vicariously through him, wishing that we could live his life too. To all these people staring intently at one person hanging on his every word remind you of something. We're going to go there. Scorsese, a devout Catholic, has spent much of his career exploring faith in his films, yet in the wolf of Wall Street characters worship at the altar of something else. Money

Speaker 2:          04:20          the camera holds on these people, each one and focus so we can see they're painfully average faces. Desperate plain looking. People looking for meaning, desiring that which can elevate them above their mundane existence. Iscore, Scorsese, cynically likening, be transformative power of faith to the transformative power of money, except the Almighty never promised a million bucks in eight easy steps. Three, one if by solidly portraying a crowd that warships Jordan, despite his detestable actions, scorsese suggests something really sinister that we actually like being taken advantage of. French philosophers, John Francois Leotard famously said as much the English unemployed did not become workers to survive. They enjoyed the hysterical masochistic, whatever exhaustion it was hanging on in the minds, in the foundries, in the factories in hell. They enjoyed it, enjoyed the mad destruction of their organic bodies, the decomposition of their personal identity. You are lower than pond scum, enjoyed the disillusion of their families and villages, and enjoyed the new monsters, anonymity of the suburbs in the pubs in the morning and evening. So could this closing image indicate the voluntary submission of the masses who not only don't mind white collar criminals stealing their money, but find a perverse enjoyment in their banal existence under the heel of the Jordan Belfort's of the world. This one single shot is emblematic of just how complex the wolf of Wall Street is as a true totem of our culture of access. The film defies easy answers. This format is a bit of a test for us, so let us know what you think in the comments and as always, guys, thanks for watching peace.

Speaker 1:          06:11          So hope you guys enjoyed that. We've got a whole bunch of pilots on the slate this year. This is just one of them. We've got another one coming out in about a month. Also next month. We're doing the next in this series, which is on the shining, so be sure to be on the lookout for that. This one was really special to us. Uh, as you know from watching our channel, we love movies. This was an opportunity for us to take our love for movies to the next step.

Speaker 1:          06:56          We're doing this very interesting thing today. We're working on the shining through. Jared and I were brainstorming on how we can come up with something that had a little more production value, right? To take the idea of a video essay, but we're talking about a theme typically or philosophy in movies and now instead it's like how can we talk more about technique and style and do it in a way that's different from most other video assets you find on the Internet Lot, rode microphones and digital spot supporting us. Your donation and your health and your support means everything to us. You guys will be possible for us to try and continue to develop wise crack, to continue to stretch the brand.
