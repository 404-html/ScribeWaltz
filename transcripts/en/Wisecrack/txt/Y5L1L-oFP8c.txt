Speaker 1:          00:00          This video is brought to you by brilliant.org. Hey wisecrack. It's brainy. Jared here, Helen, and today we're talking about the first season of one of the most cerebral enemies out there. Psychopaths tonight, not just cut a when you kiddish data, so no, she still sick and each coteau auto to go to her daycare.

Speaker 2:          00:26          What about yours? Is the digital economy in?

Speaker 1:          00:33          Yeah, they're talking to each other by quoting philosophy and it's amazing. Set in a dystopian Japan where everything is controlled by a seemingly omniscient computer. The civil system, psychopaths asked some pretty hefty questions. Mainly, is it possible for a computer to determine everything about us?

Speaker 2:          00:57          Does she could see it so she didn't get a sick guy just against this,

Speaker 1:          01:07          and more importantly, would we want to live in a society without freewill? I don't cook with. Does she get out? She didn't know that well, as it happens, this question isn't just about philosophy, but also science. So sit down, shut up and let disembodied. Helen, explain how the civil system just might suggest that freewill is a neurological and societal illusion in this wise crack addition on the science and philosophy of psychopaths and cues. Sirens. That's what we do with spoilers, right? Also covering all the sexy smart stuff in this series would be impossible to do in one video, so if you want to hear jared break it down some more, let us know in the comments. First, a quick recap. For the uninitiated. In the world of psychopaths, the civil system determines everything about you from your job to the likelihood that you'll commit a crime all by constantly scanning your brain and keeping you under surveillance. This handy Dandy all encompassing reading is called your psychopaths and it's what the civil system uses to make all these decisions about you

Speaker 2:          02:18          email system in your home that you knew.

Speaker 1:          02:32          Enter a Kanye soon, amaury a Newbie inspector at the Criminal Investigations Department or CID. It's kind of like being a cop, except instead of following the law, you're following the systems, directions, demo mother that she beat us. You still couldn't, and instead of police dogs, you get enforcers who were basically would be criminals that the system has granted limited freedom to in exchange for. Well not a lot.

Speaker 1:          03:03          You might think that a legal system based off a computer scanning your brain is some minority report level bull. You have free will so you shouldn't be arrested before you actually commit a crime. Right? Well, let me stop you right there. As psychopaths illustrates, it's not quite that simple. First, we have to understand what the brain and the decision making process really is. Most neuroscientists today think there are two systems in the brain. The first system is us. That little voice in our heads, those emotions, we feel all those thoughts. We think it's the stuff we're actually aware of when we make a decision. This is the system where we like to think it happens, but that's not entirely the case. Below this system is another system, a huge lattice work of neurons that controls everything from spatial processing to breathing. Importantly, this second system is a black box.

Speaker 1:          03:53          No matter how much armchair philosophizing we do, we can't penetrate it, and this is where the science of free will comes in. See, in the 19 eighties, Dr Benjamin Lavette conducted a pretty groundbreaking experiment. He asked subjects to look at a clock then at a time of their own choosing, flick the wrist labelle then recorded the electrical impulses from their brain called the readiness potential and compared it with the time the subjects believed they made the decision to flick their wrist. The results readiness potential proceeded the subject's awareness of making the decision by about half a second. In other words, the decision to flick their wrist happened somewhere in the unconscious system about half a second before they thought they made the decision. Kind of like funder following lightning and while labettes experiment wasn't without flaws like how he relied on self reporting, it's important to note that other researchers have borne out similar results and experiments that were better controlled when we can't say for sure that there's a causal relationship here.

Speaker 1:          04:49          We can say that on some level it looks like the decision making process begins in this unconscious part of the brain, which makes you wonder, are we really completely in control of the choices we make and if we're not, how can we say their ours labettes experiment goes a long way in making sense of psychopaths is world. After all, why would anyone let a computer make a preemptive judgments about them ordering every facet of their lives? Well, because a very smart computer like the civil system can have a deep understanding of the brain's black box in a sense knowing is better than we know ourselves held. The system knows the inner workings of the unconscious mind so well that it can even identify likely criminals as toddlers,

Speaker 3:          05:28          both either cycle bus as she got a coco and you do in a

Speaker 1:          05:38          sense the relationship between the civil system and its citizens is parallel to the relationship between the two systems in our brain, the citizens mole about with other feelings, thoughts, and seeming choices while literally thousands of feet below their feet is a vast network of sensors, processors, and fiber optic cables. All in charge of them, but if our unconscious mind is affecting our conscious decisions, we have to wonder what then is affecting our unconscious mind. If we're here subliminal messages saying, Love Logan, Paul, are we actually going to like him? Unsurprisingly, the civil system takes the question of what can affect its citizens minds very seriously. The system is practically obsessed with keeping the mental states of its citizenry, squeaky clean, so much so that it measures the stress levels of public spaces constantly. Imagine walking around the mall peacefully, minding your own business when you're psychopaths reading changes and this guy comes up to you with this obsession of keeping its citizens healthy. It's also not surprising that the system will also black out the press for the public good consumers and it goes without saying that other forms of expression like music and art are also limited. This is pretty much an Orwellian nightmare of the first degree, but as the simple system wrong to control freedom of speech

Speaker 4:          06:58          because you're a to you guys to go with you so you can join or

Speaker 1:          07:07          homelands handled. Chibe, does she still have some on some other, as frightening as it may sound, science at least might say no. As it turns out, human beings are world class imitators. We're so good. In fact, that we do it innately without even realizing it. Research performed by Andrew Meltzoff has shown that infants imitate even the most ludicrous of actions. Fourteen month olds, for example, we'll do dumped like use their foreheads instead of their fingers to turn on the touch sensor light simply by watching an adult do it. Now, there's evidence to suggest that children are such good imitators because the parts of their brain that control inhibition aren't fully developed, but just because we're not wearing diapers doesn't mean adults are any less likely to imitate their peers. In fact, humans are so susceptible to imitation it just perceiving an action performed by another person will drastically increase the likelihood of them emulating it.

Speaker 1:          08:02          This is called the chameleon effect, and it has to do with a special set of brain cells called mirror neurons, which fire when we watch others' performance action. This goes on during all of our interactions without us ever noticing it, and that's the key takeaway. It happens automatically and subconsciously it happens in that impenetrable system of our brain. So why would the symbol system need to crack down on crime before crime happens because behavior is contagious and that means everything from laughing to violence and when we're exposed to the ladder, even in the regular world, there are consequences, and this seems to be the case in the world of psychopaths. When the city is flooded with low grade criminals wearing helmets that stopped the civil system from reading, they're psychopaths. We see violence spread to the normal citizens within almost gleeful contagion cycle. Have a good one, nosy, go,

Speaker 5:          08:56          go to Korea. Both ads about it. They didn't know what hit them at the. She was, like I said, I go to the shoot on bulk or Chico state or

Speaker 1:          09:09          so. Whether it's in your brain or on the streets, it's clear that the civil system is bent on removing agency from its citizens.

Speaker 2:          09:16          She be done. Okay. Eight kids still as you want a night sort of kids done three ish almost today,

Speaker 1:          09:23          and this is where we get to the question at the heart of psychopaths. What is the value of living in a society without freewill? It's exactly this question that drives showgirl Moxie map. This first seasons antagonist maximized, driven to test the value of freewill in a society where it's been rendered, meaningless

Speaker 2:          09:39          selling them. I just don't know to Thomas, he knew he needed community today. Geeky stuff, so no hunting touch you. I know annual [inaudible] your needs in Taco bell could still no Thomasina sort of got home. Tony told him I. he's your typical Tomas. Islam told us touching. It cuts you out

Speaker 1:          10:19          in positing the necessity of freewill. Mark Shimo borrows a page from wisecrack favorite Emmanuel Kant, who believes that you can only be moral by following moral laws out of your own free will and Moxie. Mark goes to insane links to see the worth of people's will. Enabling criminal after criminal who wants to test their will against the system. But Mark Shima is the batty. So does that mean a believes? The opposite is she the symbol systems number one fan going all in for the belief that freewill must be squashed for the greater collective good. Well, not really. Throughout the series a connie displays a unique sense of individualism. She was such a good student that the system determined she'd be a good fit in literally any industry.

Speaker 1:          11:03          So look, get the. And after she joined the CID, a Conay early on questions the merit of blindly following the civil systems orders, culminating with her disobeying her bosses order to kill her enforcer, Shinya Coca, me, Hon. Xy cases that take your assignments. And although she begrudgingly allows the system to remain by the end of the first season, she does so on her own terms, each that I see me. Do you want me to get any city in this sense? Uh, Connie represents a sort of middle ground. Sure. Maybe the unconscious mind or the civil system influences her decisions, but ultimately they're still hers to make despite reaffirming a system that strips her of some agency. Uh, Connie herself manages to preserve the semblance free will. But in the end, a con, I can't actually stop mocks Yuma. That role falls to Kokanee. Now we could say a lot about why Moctezuma values Koga me so much more than a connie, but I think it has to do with this by letting the civil system dictate your life. Mcsema believes you stop becoming an individual without free will. You're not a human, but merely a cog in the machine. Maybe this is why. Kogi, the man who willing to live as a fugitive from the system in order to stop mock Cima is the only one mcsema cares about. By the seasons end. Cogan may is the only one who acts freely, and in this sense, he's the only one mock Shima has a real relationship with in this world.

Speaker 6:          12:57          Both

Speaker 1:          13:07          what makes the world of psychopaths so frightening is that unlike other shows, this dystopian society isn't the result of paranoia or crisis management, but of scientific progress. So what do you guys think is freewill, all that great or even real, or would we all be better off letting a super computer called the shots? Personally, I've over free will and letting computers only check email, stay ahead, brilliant dot or will help me train my brain through curated sequences of fun arcade style questions in logic, linear Algebra, classical mechanics, artificial neural networks, and more. These modules test critical thinking and analysis skills that could apply to the real world. And if you want to learn more about our future overlords, I'd recommend their module all machine learning which breaks down how supercomputer succeed in analyzing data.
