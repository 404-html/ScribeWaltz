Speaker 1:          00:16          Greetings and welcome to earthlings cinema. I am your host, Garrick's wormy Lloyd. This week's artifact is the prestige starring Huey Lewis and the newsy and directed by neither one of them. The film tells the story of Angier and Borden to Earth Shamans who become rivals over a simple misunderstanding about whether engineers wife should be alive or not. They take turns injuring each other's frail, mortal bodies and snooping in each other's diaries for hot smut went ng or finds out. Borden has a new incantation called the Trans Man. He becomes obsessed with finding out how it all works without, you know, sticking his foot in his mouth. He tries using a double. He conveniently finds wandering around 10 feet outside the building, but the double soon fines. He has more of a passion for Trapeze, so angier kidnaps fallon, borden's assistant who never speaks and whose face we never see clearly.

Speaker 1:          01:08          Somehow without ever looking at his face or talking to him, borden relents and gives them a clue. The Tesla model three, so angier drives is affordable, yet stylish electric car across the ocean to America to find Nicholas Tesla and bully him into building a transmogrification machine and you're successfully uses the machine and becomes the biggest hippo on campus and that makes borden have very sad hippo. A very sad hippo. Indeed Michael Caine is in this movie in case that wasn't clear, borden sneaks backstage to investigate, only to find engineers stupidly drowning in a water tank like some sort of noninvasive yes mammal borden is arrested and found guilty by reason of proximity, you will by the neck until borden is murdered by the earth government. And only after he's fully choked out does Sir Michael find out the Pepsi Twist Angier is still alive and kicking with one of his feet at least who's still alive.

Speaker 1:          02:04          It seems angier has been suicidal himself at the end of every performance leaving behind a fresh baked clone to live until the next one. Then just as Angier is patting himself on the back board and shows up and performs his greatest trick, shooting him with a gun by one Pepsi twist, get the second for half price. Borden is actually two twin brothers who would trade off being borden and fallon, depending on who was having a better hair day. Angier bleeds out all his remaining blood and borden meets up with that double crossing legend of stage and screen to retrieve his daughter who is also a part of this in the prestige. Shamanism is a metaphor for storytelling, which is a euphemism for talkies at the start of the film cutter explains the structure of a magic trick. The magic trick consists of three policies. This progression also reflects the three act structure.

Speaker 1:          02:54          The comprises the bulk of Hollywood features. Even Beverly Hills Act. One is the pledge in petition shows you something boldly colored bird or man in the world of film. This translates to the introduction of characters and conflict. Generally something to do with not having a date to dog prom. Act Two is the turn. The second eight is cool. The magician takes the picture which gets its name because act one turns into act two, act two introduces complications. In this case, the advent of borden's trans man trick, which ignites and years descent, and a nonbinary openmindedness. The turn culminates when engineers activates the machine and the audience is left wondering when Batman is going to show up. I must leave the board. Yes. You sitting there and reading my diary awaiting a death. Somebody under act three is the prestige, which coincidentally is also the name of the film.

Speaker 1:          04:01          This is when the story gathers the narrative threads and ties them into a neat little bowflex climaxing and a grand flourish significantly. The structure is explained by a man named cutter, a term that references an editor's role in pieces of film together. Too Bad, our editors are pieces of unwavering professionalism, knows how to do his job just as a shaman distracts us with techniques like needlessly vulgar imagery or a needless. The attractive assistance pretty assistant is most affective for Mr. the film diverts the audience from the twist even while dangling it right in front of our state of the art ocular implants, but child guesses immediately that the birdcage trick used the twin cutter even comes right out and states it comes out at the end is the only way, but the audience is so dazzled by showmanship and the advent of electricity that we are still gobsmacked when borden finally explains all of which goes to prove cutters theory, whether watching a magic trick or a movie or a donkey show, the audience wants to be fooled, swept away by the narrative so that we may be wowed at the end because no one goes to a donkey show.
