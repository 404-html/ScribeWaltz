Speaker 1:          00:00          This video was sponsored by the purge on USA network. What's up wise crack jared here. As you know, we're pretty big fans of the purge, so we were stoked when USA came to us and gave us a sneak peek of the first two episodes of the new purge TV series, a 10 episode television event, Tuesdays on USA network. We've already discussed the socioeconomic themes prevalent in the purge films, but the show has already shown some promise in extending these themes in some interesting ways. So for those of you excited about the show, we're going to go through a couple of key philosophical and sociological concepts to frame the way you watch it. So without further ado, welcome to this wise crack quick take on what you need to know before you watch the purge on USA. As we've discussed in our philosophy of videos, the purge largely functions as an extended metaphor for the way entire groups of people become disposable in our current economic environment.

Speaker 1:          00:50          In this case, the new founding fathers literally specify one day out of the year the the rich can eradicate the superfluous poor who are deemed economic burdens as the Revolutionary Dante Bishop says, it's a lot easier to just kill the poor than to provide them with health care, welfare, housing, et Cetera. We also see how the purge can promote the interests of the well to do in society. We're actively profit off all the chaos and the first film, the upper middle class San and family makes bank selling home security systems to everyone in their gated community in the purge TV show. All of this is still front and center. The rich and well connected are throwing parties from secured houses while everyone else is forced to fend for themselves, especially in the inner cities. But one of the things that's really interesting about the TV series is that it explores how order emerges in an ard.

Speaker 1:          01:41          Now, if that sounds confusing, just stick with me. Consider how the purge is basically the temporary suspension of society. It's laws and norms and institutions all go out the window once the clock strikes seven. But in the TV show we see how even in anarchy, different kinds of social bonds will arise amidst the anarchic murder. Thon one of those seedlings of order is a market, a means for people to exchange goods and services. This one just exists for only 12 hours. Now the purchase always been lucrative, don't get me wrong, but so far we've mostly seen profit that happens before or after the purge, like home security systems, guns, insurance. You get the idea in the show, we see how people coordinate actions by skipping the brute force and using good old fashioned cash. For example, we learned many cab drivers work on perch night to take advantage of the surge pricing and how we're going all night.

Speaker 1:          02:33          You passing guys do, he's driving around crazy. But I've heard surge money elsewhere and assassin takes contracts to kill people, but only during the hours in which it's legal is conspiracy to commit murder still a crime if the murder happens on the purge. And do you declare that on a 10 99 well, I digress with all the poor people the purchase got rid of. There's also a lot more capital just sitting in the pockets of the new founding fathers. Big Wigs that us, we follow a couple going to an nff, a purge party for the sole purpose of stomaching, the brutal in difference of the elites in order to Schmooze and NFFA party member to invest in their new projects. And no doubt we'll probably see a fair amount of insider trading happening at these 1% or purge parties. So money is one way to organize things instead of beating people to get what you want.

Speaker 1:          03:21          Markets can facilitate exchange, but there's one other way that TV show explores order amidst the anarchy. Social contracts at its core, the idea of a social contract does that we sacrifice certain rights to enjoy living in a society. So even if I want to steal candy from the children as a hobby, I have to give up this past time to enjoy it. Not living in the purge for 365 days a year. The purge films of largely emphasize the way humanity acts when the law is suspended, when the social contract ceases, when the clock strikes seven and without threat of legal retribution, people revert to their primal selves as they release the beast. It's a specific narrative of human nature proposed by philosopher Thomas Hobbs to theorize that before governments came along, life was basically the Beta version of the curve, but it's a narrative to purge.

Speaker 1:          04:10          Franchise has been challenging. We've been in the first purge or the government needed to sow discord to get people hyped about murder nine. While the show certainly has strong elements of a hobby and war of all against all, it's not quite so simple, rather than everyone reverting to their allegedly natural and violet selves without the threat of below man, we see that most people just want to get along. Many employed the purge altogether and even within the purge we see a kind of social contract starting to emerge. For instance, paramedics are left alone not because of some law, but rather as a social norm. Safe with us were off limits. I'm renting person. Others signed literal contracts that forfeit their rights to purge as they attend parties or pull all nighters in lockdown office buildings.

Speaker 2:          04:57          Once the Burj begins, his 38th floor will be locked out as a safety security on all workers including the both of you have signed waivers giving up their rights to purge on this floor for the entire evening.

Speaker 1:          05:06          However, we see a bar that suspends all purging privileges based only out of mutual respect. Slash sphere for the owner of the bar somewhat like hops is Leviathan, but unwritten laws in the form of social norms aren't always so rosy. The show looks at the darker side as a woman having worked her ass off for years is teased with the opportunity to make partner at her prestigious firm, but the unspoken rule that to her progress is her unwillingness to reciprocate her bosses. Creepy propositions, although he hasn't come out and set it, she knows the only thing standing between her and her dream is her unwillingness to put out. We're only two episodes in the seeing is beholds 10 episode series focuses on purge tonight. We can definitely expect to see more commentaries on human nature in the face of chaos. So thanks again to the purge on USA network for sponsoring this video. Also, I'm going to leave you guys for the list of things I would do during a purge import exotic pets. Cut The tag off my mattress. Arrange large purchases with no sales tax. File my taxes. Roger gently get like $1,000 worth of fireworks. No pick up my dog's poop from the sidewalk. A ton of copyright infringement. File patents for things I didn't invent. Reverse engineer or popular game and sell it for cheaper. And definitely, definitely double parking. So be sure to watch the purge Tuesdays on USA network and as always, peace guys.
