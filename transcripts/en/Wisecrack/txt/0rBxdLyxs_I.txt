Speaker 1:          00:08          Well, we have an article in last month's art news about museums in China, and there's hundreds of them coming all over China, but they're not run the same way that Western museums are run. The difference is that the people running western museums are coming out of a long history of kind of established profession, and they're kind of, in China, the standards are different, so maybe the way they choose exhibitions is different. Maybe the way they approach the idea that there should be climate control is different. Maybe the way that somebody gets into the position of director is different because maybe it's more political. Maybe there's more government control of what's going on in the exhibitions.
