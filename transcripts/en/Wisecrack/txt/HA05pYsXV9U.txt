Speaker 1:          00:00          Hey guys, stick around to the end of the video for a behind the scenes look of what we got cooking up for the future of wise crack. Enjoy the show. Hey, wise crack jared here. So just like everyone else with a ps four, I've been grinding my thumbs to nubs playing God of war, and if you haven't had the pleasure to play it yet, things are pretty different this time around.

Speaker 2:          00:22          That's the thing. Change the forest feels different. Everything is different. Do well on it.

Speaker 1:          00:32          Instead of a roid raging Greek god of destruction who experience points,

Speaker 1:          00:38          Credo says, now a melancholy dream daddy complete with a child in a dead wife. This stark changing credos got me thinking, is this part of a much larger zeitgeisty? See something is happening to our heroes and if you don't believe me, look no further than wolverine and Luke Skywalker. How to Wolverine? Go from this colorful murder machine to this angsty old man. And how did luke go from this starry eyed vendor keen to this disenchanted recluse? And in the same vein, how did Credo Sco from this blade swinging harbinger of death to this bummed out widower? Well, to figure out why this is happening, we're going to have to visit the era defined by the king of swagger, the Duke. Welcome this wise crack addition on the age of the post hero and stay frosty guys. Spoilers ahead. Before the marvel industrial complex was even a glimmer in Stanley's I, there was another genre that dominated film and an all too familiar way.

Speaker 1:          01:34          The Western, according to theorist, will ride all westerns are born from one basic formulation, the story of a loan stranger who rides into a troubled town and cleans it up. Winning the respect of the townsfolk and the love of the school, Barb. The other plots are all built upon its symbolic foundation. Westerns from the likes of John Ford, Clint Eastwood, and Sergio Leone dominated the Hollywood landscape for decades. There was no need for iron man or captain America when you had Clint Eastwood being a bad ass and John Wayne leaking Americana all over every set. He walked on. Young Fella, if you're looking for trouble, I'll accommodate you. So what happened? Where'd all the cowboys go? Well, Hollywood had a sort of western backlash. Instead of producing traditional Westerns, they started making a kind of anti western or what were called post westerns. Whereas your traditional western wood basket in the heroics of this gigantic, much of a livermore post western would show us this

Speaker 3:          02:37          slim gimme Gimme some water. Please flip flip.

Speaker 1:          02:44          The basic idea is that post westerns redeployed Western tropes to make new arguments about the ideas that westerns took for granted. Now, like anything else, it's easier to show you how it works. So let's take a look at a true classic post Western unforgiven. Unforgiven follows William Money, a retired gunslinger who's legendary. Talent for shooting was fueled by his old friend whiskey.

Speaker 2:          03:07          I like whiskey done. Unless there's anything else. I ain't had a drop in over 10 years

Speaker 1:          03:16          now. Sober and trying to live a peaceful life. Raising pigs. William gets pulled back into the gunslinger life to save his farm. And family. Unforgiven is a post western because it takes the formulation of the western and flips it. The heroes aren't mysterious and hardly clean anything up, but rather bring chaos with them in a quest for peace that isn't about a town or ranch, but about themselves and the future. This structure of the hero leaving the world of violence and mid behind only to be pulled back in is exactly the structure of you guessed it, the god of war, Logan and the last Jedi. In fact, they resemble the qualities of a post western almost perfectly. So let's start with God of war. Credos left behind his violent past,

Speaker 1:          04:04          went to the woods to raise a family after his wife dies, dns on a tray and travel across the realm. Sue sprinkle her ashes from the tallest peak so we can already see a retired warrior looking for a calm life of chopping down trees, hunting and yelling at his son. Look at me, boy, boy, boy, boy, boy, boy, boy, boy. But of course nothing is easy and he gets roped back in. When bulger gets wind of his presence and tries to hunt him in a tray is on their journey similar to William Money, who must drink whiskey to revert back to the legendary murderer in order to save the town and ensure his family safety. Credo says forced to bust out the chaos blades and revert to the death machine we know and love in order to save a trace immediately he's confronted by the ghosts of his past and the reality that he can't escape it. You cannot change. You will sound familiar. Just like Credo slogan used to be a turbo badass death dealer. I mean his bones are covered in metal, but wait, who's that living in the desert like some kind of weird hermit. It's our boy wolverine, but he's old and sad and has a daughter now and goes by Logan,

Speaker 2:          05:20          your uh, but we took you in.

Speaker 1:          05:27          You have logan imagines be wolverine as a past. His prime limo driver who takes care of his elderly foster father in the first few minutes of the film, his aversion to violence has put on display. You don't want to do what's soon. He's caught up protecting a young girl from assassins cyborgs and other goons like in God of war and unforgiven. Logan is only drawn back into violence by his desire to protect and help a younger generation, but despite his intentions, the violence follows him and innocent families. Farm is turned into a slaughterhouse in response. Logan tries again to leave the violence behind, but it sneaks back into his life as Laura and the other children are captured and Logan's got to do some savings. Finally, he comes to terms with the violence, takes a serum like a certain whiskey shot and goes hog wild. He embraces the violence as the only way to save Laura and finally finds peace similar to unforgiven. Not to mention Shane,

Speaker 4:          06:30          there's no going back, right or wrong. It's brand brand sticks,

Speaker 1:          06:36          logan and God of war. Show us a former warrior turned protector who must swap the shield for a sword or a gun or clause or blades of chaos, despite the fact that all they want is to leave that life behind a try over and over to get away, but they get pulled back. In. Test what I thought I was out credos once a peaceful life for his son, and that means war with the gods. Logan wants to protect Laura. That means releasing the beast.

Speaker 1:          07:08          Money wants to help his kids. That means hunting down those who might come after him. It's the choice to confront their painful nature for the sake of helping others that ultimately redeemed credos, logan and money. So how does the last Jedi? I fit into this. It's not quite the same, but just as those characters are forced to Donna Mantle, they've dreamt of leaving behind, so to does space. Hobo, Luke Skywalker, he isolates himself, renounces his legend, and even gives up using the force, I suppose just as the Post Western reevaluates the glory of the traditional Western. So too does the last jet. I reevaluate the deeds of the jet I order and the mess they've left the galaxy in at the height of their powers. They allowed God city cities to rise, create the empire and wiped them out. It was a jetta I master who's responsible for the training and creation of Darth vader, but when the resistance is about to be completely snuffed out, Luke must stop fleeing from his past and reignite the legend, once again, to sustain the light and save his sister is ready to die because just like the other characters, he's giving something to the future.

Speaker 1:          08:18          The myth of scale. So why is this happening to our heroes? Well, it all goes back to myths. As Right said, a myth is a communication from a society to its members. The social concepts and attitudes determined by the history and institutions of a society are communicated to its members through its myths. Put simply, myths are the stories society tells itself about itself. That's why we saw the posts western emerge in the shadow of Watergate and Vietnam. We needed stories that reflected an age of distrust in institutions and a lack of belief in the American myth. It's similar to where we ended up as a culture after the 2008 financial crisis and why suddenly we're seeing this pattern reemerge all over the place. We're even seeing this self critical turn in the greatest mythic framework of our time, the superhero movie. Think about the best marvel movies.

Speaker 1:          09:12          Winter soldier has captain America, the poster boy for the American way questioning the US government for not just taking down the carriers. Neck were taken down, shields or learns, a real leader has to confront their nations ugly history and all the pain that comes with that. Tony Stark has space combat ptsd and iron man three and in civil war. The consequences of his actions come back to haunt him. Even Superman has issues figuring out right and wrong, which is the one thing superman is supposed to know for sure. None of our mythical figures are spared, and this is what I mean by the age of the post zero. If Post westerns emerged as people tired of the same myths from an era passed our post heroes like Credos, logan and Luke skywalker's signaling the same, and we're currently in the process of questioning our cultural myths. What kind of myths will we make to replace them? And what will these myths tell us about the society we want to build?

Speaker 5:          10:08          Thanks for watching guys and thanks for sticking around. Things may look like business as usual on the channel, but we've actually been busting our ass cooking up some awesome new pilots behind the scenes, so we're working on more shows about movies, a couple of shows about current events, more about science and even a show about the stock market. So I'm going to give you guys a little sneak peek as to what's in the works. All right, so first up we got to show that is actually premiering in late June called the film tourists where I go inside cinema classics and break down the film techniques that make them smart and effective. So where we usually talk about ideology, philosophy in subtext here we're going to be focusing more on the form and the technique and how those things make the films so darn good. Yes, there I am inhabiting the shot of the wolf of Wall Street.

Speaker 5:          10:53          The next one we got up is called how did we get here, which is an animated series with a super talented artists that I went to college with. Her name is tyler. I'm so excited to be able to bring her vision to the world. This is going to be exploring current events and the forces that shape them. So this pilot episode is actually about fake news and Fahrenheit 4:51, the Ray Bradbury book. Other thing we have going on is another explainer series and it's more about culture criticism in terms of real life contemporary stuff. So our first episode is called was the Internet a mistake? We're working with the amazing illustrator of thug notes and I'm super excited to be talking about current events and talking about stuff that's outside of media. We're also working on new science shows, so I'm sure you guys have seen our new host, Helen has been doing stuff like the psychology of the purge and the psychology of one punch man.

Speaker 5:          11:37          We've got more of those kinds of videos in the works as well as Helen has been working with a doctor at the University of Southern California. His name is Dr Jonas Kaplan and he is a neuroscientist and he's actually giving us access to a neuroscience imaging machine and we actually want to do kind of our own experiments to see if we can draw conclusions about how the brain reacts not only to media but to various things that we experienced on social media. So this is kind of a dream come true for me because I've always wanted wisecrack to not only be about reflecting on studies, but being a part of the research and studies process. So we're also working on a money show. So for those of you who listened to our podcast, show me the meaning. You know, Ryan Ryan has been our editor for the last four years and he's going to try to get quote stupid rich by investing in stuff like cryptocurrencies, penny stocks and possibly sex robots.

Speaker 5:          12:22          So learning about how to be good with money through Ryan being crazy. It's gonna. Be Fun. Also our pow, Greg Edwards, the Genius Behind Thug Notes, Aka sparky suites, Phd, will be returning to wisecrack with a new comedy podcasts that we're developing together.
