Speaker 1:          00:00          There's a statistic that over 90% of people go home at the end of the day feeling unfulfilled by their work. This is the difference between liking your job and loving your job. You can like your job, but do you love your job? And over 90% of the people who, who work these days don't. Um, and I imagine a world in which that statistic is completely reversed in which the vast majority of people go home at the end of the day feeling fulfilled by the work that they do, feeling that they've contributed to something bigger than the bigger than themselves. I've always been a pretty happy go lucky guy. But about five years ago, I reached a point in my career where my passion was gone. Um, I stopped loving what I was doing and I even got to the point where I didn't really like it anymore. And for a happy person, just being unhappy, it was bad enough.

Speaker 1:          00:45          And it was this point in my life that I made this discovery, this thing called the why. And what I learned is that every single organization on the planet, even our own careers, function on three levels. What we do, how we do it, and why we do it. These are the things that we think make us different or special compared to everyone else. But very few of us can clearly articulate why we do what we do. And I don't mean to earn a living or provide for your family. It was a results by why. I mean, what's your purpose? What's your cause, what's your belief? And after I learned my why, I literally stopped telling people what I did and only started telling them what I believed. And not only was my passion restored, but Mike Career and my life changed dramatically and took on an in an entirely new path with, with, with vastly more meaning.
