Speaker 1:          00:03          A wise crack. Jared, again, while you guys probably think of key and Peele as the duo that gave us president Obama's anger translator or the visionaries that finally made an action movie about a kitten, they're also responsible for some of the smartest comedy that's reasonably grace the airwaves. And while much of their success can be chalked up to their unique and often absurd characters, they're true brilliance lies and they're streamlined writing style and a commitment to sketches that are as funny. He wrote town like Atlanta as they are socially and emotionally true. I thought I was going to need rope tie. Oh you are. And how do they tell that truth? Well, let's find out since nothing is better than overexplaining a joke. Welcome to this wise crack condition on key and Peele and I guess there's sort of spoilers ahead to really understand what makes key and Peele so great.

Speaker 1:          00:50          We need to look a bit deeper and discover the comedic philosophy that informs their work. And believe it or not, these guys follow in the footsteps of this guy, the door through which you will. For those of you unfamiliar that isn't the Demon lovechild of Dan Harmon, Alan Morin's, Levoy Jijak, that's del close, a pioneer of comedy who still hugely influential today, but before we get into how key and peele embody closest comedic philosophy, we need to take a look at a little comedy science. While you probably don't associate science with comedy, who can better understand the success of many key and peele sketches by distilling them down to a core comedic structure. In this structure, we start in a world with a built in set of expectations, which is then contrasted with an unusual behavior and this behavior is heightened and explored until you've pissed herself from laughing so hard and other the words comedy is arrived at through exploring a behavior that breaks with the expectations we have of a given situation.

Speaker 1:          01:49          If we wanted to go full, beautiful mind on this structure, it might look a little something like this. Reasonable reality instead of expectations plus unusual behavior and or point of view multiplied by raised emotional stakes plus an ending which subverts established pattern equals comedy bliss, but enough comedic calculus. Let's take a look at substitute teacher as an example. The schedule opens in a high school classroom and environment that carries with it a set of standard expectations. Board students, chalkboards books, and a teacher trying to wield some authority. But all this changes when Mr Garvey begins taking attendance.

Speaker 2:          02:26          The colon, which they call a net. No, Jay Kuala here. Yeah. Uh,

Speaker 1:          02:36          do you mean jacqueline? Now that we have are unusual behavior? I he, Mr Garvey's inability to pronounce stereotypically white names, things can really get cooking. We get to see both the logic behind Mr Garvey's frustration. I'm the rail. The rail along with the increasingly terrified students as Mr Garvey continues this unusual behavior is anger increases while their fear. This simple underlying logic is what helps accelerate the comedy with each move. Once we see this pattern repeated a few times were already predicting the next move,

Speaker 3:          03:09          they're not messed up. Hey Rod,

Speaker 1:          03:11          not to be bested by an attentive audience. This sketch ends by flipping our expectations for once Mr Garvey gets it right?

Speaker 4:          03:18          Timothy [inaudible]. Thank you.

Speaker 1:          03:22          Let's see how this pattern plays out in some other sketches. For example, we expect to babysit babysitter to have a quiet night, but and unusual behaviors introduced

Speaker 4:          03:31          google guy, guy I why milk

Speaker 1:          03:36          and this behavior gets emotionally heightened. Your in charge of me in my house. All right, can for forest, it's time for bed with a last minute reveal that offers a glimpse into the comedic logic.

Speaker 3:          03:47          Hush baby forrest whitaker don't say a word guy. Guy was going to buy. You were mocking bird

Speaker 1:          03:56          in another sketch. We start with a fairly mundane setting until we meet our unusual companions who are intent on living there, vigilante air marshal dream.

Speaker 4:          04:04          I tell you one thing, if not 11th or to happen up on it here plain. Don't worry. We got there.

Speaker 1:          04:13          The stakes are then raised well above cruising altitude. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          04:15          You know how mark and up that plane, oh God.

Speaker 1:          04:21          And rather than fizzling out by running the pattern to the ground, we get a surprise at the end. That reframes what we've just seen. Of course, we know that sketches that don't follow this pattern can also be hilarious. Who can deny the pure joy of will? Ferrell's gyrating midriff. I gotta have my cop out or the wonder testicular double Entendre of Alec Baldwin's baked goods. No one can resist my schweddy balls and hell, even key and peele occasionally basket in the purely absurd.

Speaker 3:          04:50          Oh, there we go. There we go.

Speaker 1:          04:54          Comedic structure is only half the story. While they're sketches are certainly funny, it's another element of their work that ensures that they're also smart key appeals commitment to finding fundamental human truth in comedy. This philosophy is not an invention of key and peele. However, they both cut their comedic chops in Chicago. A city whose comedy scene is permeated by this guy del close, and while you may not have heard of him, he's responsible for training a few decent comedians and along the way he helped write a book called truth in comedy with Sharna Halpern. That's become a Bible for comedians around the world in its, they are you that the best comedy comes from mining the depths of human existence and that this creates the grounds for comedy that is both funny and smart and idea that we see everywhere in key and peele. Oh and del close once claimed that a coven of witches cured him of his cocaine addiction.

Speaker 1:          05:44          This has nothing to do with comedy, but I think it's worth noting. This commitment to truth isn't exclusive to Chicago Comedians as this emotionally honest style has dominated recently from the diner to the break room do the streets of Italy. Now does this commitment to truth mean that good comedy always has to reflect on real and truthful situations? Hell No. But while a post apocalyptic alien invasion might not reflect the reality of the world we live in, sorry to anyone currently on acid, the core comedic idea is still grounded in something fundamentally true. That key and peels characters can instantly know who is an alien by their reaction to blackness. How did you know

Speaker 1:          06:23          C'mon redneck wants us to move into his community us. The friendlier the white characters are, the more certain they are of their alien nature. Would you let me tell your daughter, let's return to Mr Garvey. What's the truth that makes this sketch so funny for a start? This sketch reverses the trope of a well intentioned teach for America type out to save a bunch of inner city kids. This role reversal produces both the immediate comedy of Mr Garvey's mispronunciations and the socially conscious fact that this is something that happens to minority students all the time except in that case it's more uncomfortable than it is funny. Wow. Mr Garvey's reaction to a name like denise and Aaron are hilarious. Key and Peele are forcing us to ask a more complicated question. What if black teachers where as culturally incompetent as their white counterparts and thus we have a double pronged comedic attack come for the laughter and stay for the socially conscious criticism. The benefit of this mixture of comedic structure and finding the truth is that hilarious sketches can be found in any area of life, race, religion, the dark side of professional sports. You name it, and they often do so by relating to personal experience and their first sketch titled

Speaker 4:          07:37          Bay.

Speaker 1:          07:39          There's a focus on the tensions found in black masculinity between being a strong Alpha male and a committed partner. I looked this woman, you told me six 45 you said that this sketch heightens the limits that to friends will go to, to keep up the facade of being a hard ass, getting further and further away from their spouses in the process and the interstellar lengths they'll go to to maintain this facade, represent the actual effort, man we'll put into prove they're one of the bros. And of course this sketch highlights the absurdity of this whole macho performance.

Speaker 1:          08:29          This theme is also explored in the expanded key and Peele universe as their first feature film Keanu throws to normal suburban black men into the world of organized crime and drug dealing where they have to impersonate to legendary street assassins. At one point we see the two main characters performing a stereotypical sort of black masculinity play Somnio real quick. And conversely, we see some of the hardened gangsters brought to tears by the music of George Michael. They use a similar strategy in the sketch office homophobe where we see a tense interaction between two office space. You can't handle hearing about how I'm gay. I'm sorry. You just referring to your boyfriend's penis as a baby's arm holding an apple. What happened? I looked like, which leads to a serious accusation, homophobic. And while this sketch at first seems to set up a tired trope in which the humor is derived from a flamboyant gay stereotype.

Speaker 1:          09:26          That's disgusting. Oh, I see. So you don't want to see up close the pitch of my anus cause you hate day, man. This expectation is ended when the homophobes boyfriend shows up. It's my boyfriend. How are you doing? I'm doing very well. Which leads to a surprising realization for keys. Character. I get it. I'm not persecuted. I'm just a APP. And the truth of this sketch, well no matter your sexual preference or gender identity, you can still be an asshole. I'm more common source of comedic inspiration has always been good old fashion. Religion and critiques of religion are not new

Speaker 5:          09:59          when it comes to boots. Big Time Major League. You have to stand in awe, in awe of the all time champion of false promises and exaggerated claims religion

Speaker 1:          10:14          rather than following in the footsteps of those who find comedy in skewering religion. Ford's irrational claims key and peele find a much more human take on religion and in particular Christianity. The sketch opens with a group of earnest believers in prayer and this group of Christians is rewarded with a visit from the voice of God himself. However, once God responds to their prayers with some practical next step,

Speaker 6:          10:41          so whole

Speaker 1:          10:47          they become slightly less enthused. Eventually they find a nice loophole to avoid having to actually follow God's command of service.

Speaker 5:          10:54          Oh,

Speaker 1:          10:58          sketch just so great because it offers a funny critique of religion with some genuine theological nuance. The joke isn't on religion in general or believers in particular. Rather it points out the hub holocracy of those unwilling to take their own religious tradition seriously when it comes to following through on a not so fun obligation. This critique is actually one founded in Christianity itself. As the book of James Famously says, faith without works is dead. Even your most devout onto couldn't disagree with this one and even more brutally honest social critique can be seen in their sketch sound off, which is set at basic training. While we assume that the drill sergeant is going to lead the song in some absurd direction, it ends up finding comedy in a place of harsh realism from Port Orford and Armando Uris Hall are from all families. Cow Fall, we roam, sold the rich church can just, Oh, the sketch doesn't only point out the disparity and who ends up fighting America's wars, but also the reality of what awaits soldiers coming home from war.

Speaker 7:          11:56          When I come home with the kids when I come home with PTSD, the Va hospital,

Speaker 1:          12:05          somehow they managed to make a sketch about economic inequality and inadequate medical care in the military. Funny, while they have multiple sketches that use the absurdity of football for comedic fuel bootsie wow. This, he could call me todd royal, wrapping up Russia like aluminum foil in quarterback concussion. They use the trope of the heroic quarterback to shine some light on the medical reality of the game. After taking a big hit, we see the quarterback go from confused seriously about what do we do it too quickly offering fictional baked good.

Speaker 7:          12:33          Oh, you have to. Joe was ass man has put an apple pie to go around

Speaker 1:          12:37          for getting diagnosed by a teammate.

Speaker 7:          12:39          You have a brain injury. You need to get some medical and same suit

Speaker 1:          12:44          after seemingly getting it together in a rousing chance of team spirit. Quarterback notices a missing piece of his identity as a rhino.

Speaker 7:          12:55          Oh my God, somebody stole my heart

Speaker 1:          12:58          runs off in an effective parody of the inspirational sports movie genre key and Peele or showing us what it would look like if these movies accurately represented the horrific injuries suffered by athletes. While that's just a few examples, keon peels five seasons plus Keanu are filled with hours of insanely smart and insanely funny sketches and because most of their work is grounded in true human emotions and situations rather than topical humor. These sketches really hold up but most importantly key and peele serve as a reminder for the greatness of the TSA.

Speaker 7:          13:29          I'm ts monk
