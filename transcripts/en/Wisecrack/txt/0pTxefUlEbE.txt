Speaker 1:          00:07          Taking shots for anybody who may have been in a position of where he's just one vote. Granted the bigger vote getter, the biggest voter on the FMC is that, you know, we all were sitting in a world again where we thought certain things were going to happen and not happen. And clearly when you Monday morning quarterback somebody might say, well, we should have raised rates a little more quickly and made money a little less cheap and I would be one of those that would say that today. But when you sat there were making those decisions, I'm not sure that coming out of the 2000 tech bust and going through, you know, nine slash 11 and then having the Iraq war come up in the Afghan war that, that you wouldn't have had a bit of a conservative view towards how rapidly you do that. Uh, so clearly in hindsight you'd say, yes, we should have made money less cheap.

Speaker 1:          01:01          But again, I think to blame the Federal Reserve for what human beings are doing individually is, is a bit of a stretch. You know, one thing we've done in our company that is a direct reaction to this is that we actually have written into our equity and bonus plans now, we just did it this year that if there is a material misstatement or financials is that we're going to recapture from the executives the money we just gave because I thought it was just horrible what happened, not because of any of the right to collect it, but these guys walked away when their firms went and had a lot of suffering. I don't want that to happen on my watch. Doesn't mean we can't make mistakes, but I think you're going to start see compensation plans also alter, but that's a free market force that wasn't imposed by any government is boards will do that.

Speaker 1:          01:51          Our board was very receptive to it. You happen to have a management team that wanted to do it and they saw something in the news they didn't like and they change things. So through a combination of changes from the Federal Reserve combination of state implementing laws, I think we'll get some of this behind us. And I also think that what's remarkable is to think that you could have a war, you could have nine slash 11, you could have all these things happen where the global economy is still able to absorb it. And until very recently, main street wasn't suffering like Wall Street was. So our economy is still very robust and I think it'll still end up being, even with this tremendous impact. Um, it'll take awhile, but I still think we're in. We're going to end up in a good place at the end of the day.
