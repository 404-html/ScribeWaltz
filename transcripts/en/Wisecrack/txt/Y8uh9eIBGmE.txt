Speaker 1:          00:05          What's up everybody? Jared again? Today we're talking about animation, most powerful pipsqueak. Sorry about that, Edward. Now full metal alchemist. Brotherhood has all the trappings of an instant classic high concept science fiction Shit. Awesome. Fight scenes, definitely strong philosophical core. Well, that's why we're here.

Speaker 2:          00:27          Wow.

Speaker 1:          00:28          Throughout Edward and Alphonse's journey to restore their bodies. The two are confronted with various discourses on the efficacy and application of science or in their case alchemy. Sure, it's through alchemy that they hope to recover their bodies, but they also see it used for some pretty awful things.

Speaker 1:          00:49          So what is brotherhood saying about science and the way it's applied to this world and how does faith fit into this discussion? Well, let's find out. Welcome to this wisecrack addition on the philosophy of full metal alchemist, brotherhood, and of course spoilers ahead, but first a quick primer full metal alchemist. Brotherhood is set in a mistress, a country reminiscent of pre world war two Europe who's defining feature is the success of Alchemy or the manipulation and altering of matter using natural energy. Alchemy is essentially treated as a science one that combines chemistry and biology with its own unique laws and principles, alchemies most important law, the law of equivalent exchange,

Speaker 3:          01:30          non Nico, you, hello, no

Speaker 1:          01:35          or you know the law. That means if you get the right materials and draw a circle, you can do this. The show establishes a push and pull dynamic between science and faith almost immediately in episode three hour travel to the desert town of or to investigate. Father coordinate below a holy figure who has gained control of the people by offering them with miracles and indoctrinating them in the faith of Lido wisdom. The second they arrived, though the brothers make their views abundantly clear to the faithful

Speaker 3:          02:04          in general, are you motivated

Speaker 1:          02:15          and their skepticism toward the divine is justified. As it turns out, Cornell's miracles are just cleverly bailed. Applications of alchemy that he uses to attract followers, willing to die for him at an Alec exposed. Cornell is a fraud, and liberate the people at your firm is ideological tyranny. So science rules, faith drools, right? Well, not so fast. In the following episode, the brothers are sent to study under the sewing life alchemists show, Tucker Tucker was the first outcome is to successfully create a talking cmera and tries to repeat his success in order to retain his state alchemist certification. The rx fascination quickly turns to horror and in one of the biggest gut punches and anime history, we see this.

Speaker 4:          03:03          Woo.

Speaker 1:          03:04          Yeah, that's right. Tucker actually used his family, dog and his own daughter as components to create his Camaro, but far from feeling remorse. Tucker claims he was only doing what science demands

Speaker 2:          03:18          nondual Zinger, you know, simple moose, little Jentezen Kendall, Tau Mama Jemima. Send that out

Speaker 1:          03:27          in the face of such an atrocity. Science no longer seemed so innocent, does it? So where does this conflict between science and faith lead us? Tucker, the amoral alchemist in search of scientific knowledge at any cost largely sets the tone for the rest of the show. Over at 64 episodes, Brotherhood forces us to question the value of single mindedly clinging to science and the consequences of reducing all knowledge to scientific terms of motive thought loosely known in the real world. As scientism, now I know what you're thinking, jared, doubting science is what people in a coat do, but just humoring when philosophers critique scientism, they're not saying that science is a lie. What they're criticizing is how we put scientific knowledge above all other knowledge and how we try to reduce other forms of knowledge into it. According to philosopher Paul Fire, Robin, science is just one of many competing explanatory frameworks, one which is neither as rational nor consistent as it pretends to be fire.

Speaker 1:          04:26          Robin's favorite example is copernicus, who's heliocentric model of the universe was actually rejected by scientists of his day to them, aristotle's idea of celestial spheres offered a fuller explanation of why the planets moved into the sky. While Copernicus's model could correctly calculate the movement of the planets. It couldn't explain why they moved, as they did until Newton's theory on gravity was published over a century later. Science in this case wasn't interested in the truth so much as self preservation like any ideology fire. Robin worries that an unquestioning acceptance of it, like with Leonora and Lito Ism can lead to some potentially disastrous results in his book against method in science and a free society fire robin desks. Is it not possible that science as we know it today or a search for the truth and the style of traditional philosophy, will create a monster and monsters are exactly what science creates in the world of brotherhood, such as manmade Camaro's that are referred to as ungodly experiment

Speaker 2:          05:27          can put it into then when there is a killer.

Speaker 1:          05:31          This impersonal dehumanizing aspect of alchemy is enshrined in the law of equivalent exchange, which inherently reduces objects, animals, and even people to their physical components. The oreck brothers entire journey starts because the to believe they can bring their mother back to life by simply transmuting the basic ingredients of a human being. This dehumanizing nature is furthered by one of alchemies, most sought after the philosopher's stone. When Ed and ell decode Dr Marquez notes, they realize the key ingredient to the stone is human life

Speaker 2:          06:06          kingdom.

Speaker 1:          06:15          The stone is the ultimate product of alchemy allowing its users to ignore the law of equivalent exchange, but even though the stone can restore at now's bodies, the two are reluctant, if not just plain unwilling to use the stone. In contrast, the homonculus artificial humans powered by philosopher stones regurgitate scientific philosophy, reducing the souls trapped within the stones, Tamir alchemic principles while Ed and Al both use the power of the stones on one occasion each they do so while respecting the autonomy of those souls,

Speaker 2:          07:11          mother, to stay me, to cuddle. You don't want me to come. Committee,

Speaker 1:          07:23          this distinguishes the brothers as moral according to philosopher Emmanuel Kant, who famously stated that you must treat humanity whether in your own person or in the person of any other, always at the same time as an end, never merely as a means for people are never meant to be used or reduced to calculations, but rather are always a goal in themselves. But an analysis problem with alchemy is larger than it's impersonal nature, but also it's subservience to the military. Alchemy is so under the control of the industry and government that there are actually three state appointed tenants of Alchemy, the first of which is the literally obey the military who go drinking, who knows, somebody seeing him. She didn't call me Jessica goodness. In fact, state alchemists are generally referred to as dogs at the military and even as human weapons.

Speaker 2:          08:15          Hey, good.

Speaker 1:          08:20          In his book, science wars sociologists, Stanley Aronowitz, argues that scientists often view themselves as vehicles facilitating the advancement of learning and by application the progress of mankind. Yet scientists funding must come from somewhere and often it's from corporations or the state. As such, scientists don't really own their discoveries and have little say about their application throughout the animate. Ed Constantly clashes with this militarization of science by the state and his own complicity with it. As Alex Armstrong succinctly puts it, couple

Speaker 5:          08:56          thinking just a shoe tie shoe and they'll have a new Audi Shindand accuser, but the hospital loading it. Recall it.

Speaker 1:          09:05          We even see this military influence distort the basic principles of science. When ed and ell reminisce about being trained on a desert island as children, they come to the epiphany that alchemy is all about understanding the natural flow of energy, both deconstructing and reconstructing it,

Speaker 3:          09:28          so now that Lcd Bouzouki stair cycle,

Speaker 1:          09:34          what this principle is leader, twisted in the mouths of the military in justifying destroying the whole country and slaughtering its population. One general even goes so far as to rephrase it as alchemic rebirth.

Speaker 6:          09:47          Nice. I see them almost that you didn't get a coach, you punk in night. What do I do? I didn't. Social Security goes through to this thing. Lacey,

Speaker 1:          10:05          as tools of the government alchemists have become the very instruments of the series chief antagonist father who controls the MSG in state, father desires nothing more than to assume the mantle of God, a goal which he's used, alchemy, countless military conflicts and millions of innocent lives to prepare for. In fact, a masters is most brutal and heartless war. The war of extermination was fought just a further father's plan and it's this war where the state alchemists made their largest military impact. Good job or we've got an issue bothers him. It's all clinical. What's shocking about each ball isn't just the devastating force that alchemy wrecked on it. The scientific language used to explain it. Even the good guys here can't help but couch. What's essentially genocide in these sterile scientific terms almost on the cable issue. Bird. We can do that. In fact, this sanitizing nature of scientific language is what escalated, fallen wharton, new heights as fear. King Bradley told the high priest of the shallow when he offered himself up in exchange for a ceasefire. The law of equivalent exchange won't allow it

Speaker 5:          11:20          so much coaching or one on one or so days,

Speaker 1:          11:32          the fewer even considered his wife to be nothing more than an expendable pond for his greater scheme. Now, if the title of purer is raising eyebrows among you, there's a good reason for that. The country have a masters is reminiscent of pre World War II, Germany, uh, Milton nation expanding beyond its borders and a blonde haired blue eyed army whose uniforms look a lot like that of the SSS. Even the might is right motivation behind Nazi Germany, bubbles to the surface and a mistress as general raven invoke social darwinism to justify mass extermination.

Speaker 7:          12:03          So John, when you could go so good though, you know what you should see how you use of.

Speaker 1:          12:10          That's not enough to convince you. Then you only have to compare a mistresses. Human experiments did that of Auschwitz as lead Dr Josef Mengele, whether it's raising babies and underground laboratories, stitching together people in animals or ripping soltes from bodies. It's hard to say that a mistress lacks the same wanton cruelty and morbid scientific curiosity that defined mangle his operations. Mengele established a kindergarten at Auschwitz for his younger experiments allegedly stitching to gypsy girls together, and if he could have gotten his hands on a literal soul, he probably would have mutilated. Oh yeah. Did we mention that fire robin to actually fought as a lieutenant in World War II, even earning an iron cross in the process, witnessing firsthand the scientific arguments made by a dictatorship for war and genocide. It's no surprise that fire robin would one day proposed a separation between science and states with ultimate power resting in democracy in his lecture, how to defend society from science.

Speaker 1:          13:10          He argued there must be a formal separation between state and science just as there is now a formal separation between state and church. Scientists may be consulted on important projects, but the final judgment must be left to the democratically elected consulting bodies, so it's safe to say that full metal alchemist presents a cautionary tale about the blind adherence to science, but what does it say about faith? Well, throughout its 64 episode run, faith is often portrayed as another explanatory model, another source of truth and power. In fact, for a show populated almost entirely by scientists, the characters make a number of appeals to faith. In the episode, the miracle of Brush Valley and an owl witness, the delivery of a baby become awestruck and point out the limitations of alchemy. Dr Marco, the alchemist, largely responsible for the creation of the philosopher's stone during the civil war, calls it fate that he met the ish fallen scar before the to set out together to challenge the government. Similarly, Knox who worked as a doctor during the war and was subsequently estranged from his family invokes God when they've returned to him.

Speaker 8:          14:25          Some of similar you can let me know.

Speaker 7:          14:29          Even Bradley, a Homunculus wonders if his own death at the hand of scar was providence coming with Shinji. No. Good. Cool. You Know Kim? Oh, what in you are it

Speaker 1:          14:43          Bradley? Who mercilessly killed these people during the war was told that God would strike him down one day and it was the son looking like a crescent moon, which together symbolize God in Alchemy that blinded him and allowed scar too.

Speaker 7:          14:58          Right? The finishing blow

Speaker 1:          15:01          is that the thematic takeaway of the show? Science is bad. Faith is good. So keep on praying. Well, not quite. See the problem with scientism isn't that science is bad and that non science is good. Fire. Robin isn't giving the middle finger to vaccines and posting about chem trails on twitter. Nope, instead, his main contention is that science is just one of many ideas that propel society and should be treated, thus what fire alb into poses is any unreflective, veneration of any ideology because it inhibits free thought as it turns out, the blind following of science as the arbiter of truth is just as harmful as the blind following of faith as the arbiter of truth, whether it's father cornell and the homonculus using the Lido is to incite violence against their enemies or scar using his god is Vala to justify his vengeance against the alchemist

Speaker 7:          15:51          meaningfully Camino Sindhis.

Speaker 1:          15:56          Faith alone can be every bit justice, scary as science characters grow and brotherhood. When they realized the limitations of adhering to any one ideology, Edward and Alphonse, for example, begin to question the foundations of western Alchemy, which supposedly takes us energy from the tectonic movements of the earth's mantle. When father manages to cancel it out, it's their quest for an explanation that leads them to science as eastern equivalent alcohol history, which uses life energy from the planet. It's ultimately bridging the gap between these two ideologies that allows our heroes to eventually trial. The two different scientists come together to make a reverse transmutation circle that saves the lives of all semesters. Perhaps no character embodies this development more than scar, a survivor of the Ashmolean, war of extinction, scar target state alchemists out of revenge to him not only are alchemists weapons, but they transgress against God who alone possesses the right to create, but as scar learns more about a mistress, he realizes how wrong he was to seek vengeance.

Speaker 7:          16:57          No new tool you will can you committed to you in show who who Costanoa Tj

Speaker 1:          17:04          scar who wants cloaked his actions and the words of God finally understands that no ideology can justify murder. Scar even breaks from the strict laws that govern his fate, making use of the very alchemy that his god a board in order to save the country he wants hated

Speaker 7:          17:20          soldier code orange issue

Speaker 1:          17:28          bars. Transformation stands in stark contrast to the show's main antagonist. Father, who clings to his single minded belief in science. Father becomes obsessed with the power of alchemy and takes this obsession to the logical extreme. Viewing mankind is little more than materials for him to use in becoming God was on blinded by scientism. Father can't understand the value of human emotions and discards them in his attempt to become perfect. He literally ripped the seven deadly sins from himself. Lust, greed, slaw, gluttony, envy, wrath and pride. Who in turn become the other homonculus. Ultimately, it's this conviction and the absolute supremacy of science and the ability to achieve perfection through it that undoes father, the souls trapped in the philosopher's stone which he dismissed as we're energy, begin to assert their wills and rebel against him. Father, conception of a soul as a mere ingredient fails to account for the autonomy of these individuals after an epic punch to the gut, father is finally killed and dragged back into the void from whence he came where he meets the real god of being called truth. Still desperately clinging to scientism. Father demands to know what he did wrong,

Speaker 1:          18:52          unlike scar and others. Father refused to recognize any kind of human wisdom beyond alchemy.

Speaker 8:          18:57          I didn't really three already.

Speaker 1:          19:07          All of this goes to show what makes ed and now particularly special throughout the series. They're humble rejection of a single ideology from the shows outset, the to grapple with what alchemy is and what it means to be a state alchemist.

Speaker 8:          19:20          The

Speaker 1:          19:24          this questioning that makes the brother's seen both naive and likable at the brothers core is a strong desire to discover their own truth. When psychopath extraordinary solve, Jay Kim Lee has alphonse cornered. He wonders why our hero doesn't just take the philosopher's stone and get his body back. None of this will not. Chicago, Jibo, Colorado Toady model stomach go online, disco. Sure, the country would face certain destruction from father, but that's just equivalent exchange inaction. In order to get their bodies back, they'd have to give up the world safety tool. Go quote on the Horse, but our rejects that alchemic worldview reaffirming their desire to find their own truth.

Speaker 8:          20:03          Yes, simple.

Speaker 1:          20:08          It's this search for possibilities that distinguishes the brothers and allows ed to make his final transmutation. After al sacrifices himself in order to give ed his arm back, ed follows his brother into the portal to bring him back. When asked by the truth what price he'll pay. Edd smiles and offers this ability to perform alchemy and recognizes the arrogance and thinking that outcome. He could explain everything, let alone solve all his problems.

Speaker 8:          20:33          She didn't need to go to the citadel. Coke. It's the dog or the dog.

Speaker 1:          20:40          Unlike father who couldn't accept his place in the universe and equated alchemy with power. Ed knows the truth. No, not anymore. Keeps you the their bodies back in the day. Save what's left for our heroes to do in typical elric fashion. It's the keep searching for truth and new methods to discover it. As Alphonse puts it, they want to give back to the people who helped them all along their journey, but it's not a simple given. Take not a cold formula like the law of equivalent exchange.

Speaker 3:          21:20          Yeah. June, July. She's like it. A book that see

Speaker 1:          21:32          did that end. Alice traveling east and Ed West in hopes of gathering all the knowledge to make this principle a reality. Of course, old habits tend to die hard and when ed finally confesses his feelings too, when it comes out like this.

Speaker 8:          21:50          Humble. Yeah,

Speaker 1:          21:55          of course. Maybe ed didn't need to go so far from home to realize that science alone can't explain everything.

Speaker 1:          22:07          We waited 64 episodes for that moment and it was damn worth it. So what do you think wise, crack? Well, pure devotion to science lead us down a dark path.
