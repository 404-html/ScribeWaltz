Speaker 1:          00:09          Hip Hop's been dying or dead every single year since it's inception, so along with its eight of the top eight downloads last week, I feel it's not dead. It's still got a tremendous influence in American pop culture is still a great brand building community in the world. They have all kinds of, uh, inspiration and influence for American mainstream. They made the president by shifting a race, a race dialogue. They, they run DMC got MTV. There was no black people at all except Michael Jackson and he, they, they were, they had ahead and changed a lot in America and where people see each other and Jay is not dead files. I can tell this last. Ll Cool J's on the number one show. Ice T is not dead. He's 45. I'm 51. I got new businesses that are hip hop related and they're growing. I don't feel hip hop is dead. I don't feel that any good signs that would say that. I guess young people do download cricket and then people would, might buy a Whitney Houston record or something, but that's just what they do. Hip Hop is being consumed as much now as ever, and that's an important statement and it has as much effect or the American mainstream culture now as ever, and that's another good statement. So it's hard to predict the death of a culture, a cultural phenomenon that's transformed America in so many ways.
