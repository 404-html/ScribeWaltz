Speaker 1:          00:09          What

Speaker 2:          00:09          homie? I got something special for my well wrapped dollars today. I'm about to lay on your. The first episode. I'm my new audio series. Thug nodes get lit. What are your boys? You're going to keep doing this thing bringing bad as literature to the streets. There's Tom Food Airways, odd waves, whatever the hell it's called. This show is live now, so check it out on apple podcasts or your favorite podcast app, but to give you guys a little taste of what's to come. I'm going to draw some hits from the first episode right here, right now. Three examples of more money, more problems in lit. Have you thought Biggie had it hard? You won't believe this. These characters went through when they started rolling in the benjamins. Number three, Lou Ella Moss from no country for old men by Kar. Mack McCarthy is 1980 and Lou Ella Moss hunting in a Texas desert when he stumbles upon a Satchel full of seed notes at a drug deal that went south dude's and instant seven figure ball up.

Speaker 2:          01:14          Unfortunately, that money puts him in the cross hairs of anti sugar, a savage coin flipping hitman hide to retrieve the stolen loot, and this dude don't play. It'd be saying you did. You did. After sneaking back into the badlands to help out a dying man, things go from bad to worse. Lou Allen, he's chased across the desert, nearly eyes and sent to the hospital after I shoot out what the seemingly unkillable Shugart man I'm telling you that dog and time is after Harris, the guy threatened to put one in his wife's, don't bust his ass to meet her in El Paso. Unfortunately some Mexican hitman smoke Llewellyn and leave his wife completely on her own against the gun and that boy heads on straight up waste this earth just for being a third wheel and all this damn that's cold blooded. Lou Ella's life with stripe this moment he brought home that chatter, but then didn't really some say his decision to help that die man back in the desert is what ultimately can man.

Speaker 2:          02:18          Maybe this is a sign of Hulu. Well and truly is a good person who's just not cut out for that third life, or maybe it's a warning that there ain't no stopping depth. Anyone, not even for decent folks like Lulu Island and Mrs Moss. If the cartels didn't, capital Shugar shows, seeing the terminus, the double to dust them both. Hulu, I would have skipped town with all the monies I was there. No escaping this showdown with death. Either way, Lou, I would try to get out of dodge with all the muscle is bankroll. Combine them and have that Kinda cash dr the book. Then we're all know, but Jay Gatsby from the great gatsby by f Scott Fitzgerald, a Nick carraway lands a job in New York City during the twenties. He rents a shack next to the swag bag of Jay Gatsby, a mysterious playboy who throws dope as parties but never joins them.

Speaker 2:          03:12          It turns out gas be hosts. These rages in the hopes of attracting is back when honey dip. Daisy Faye, who lives across the bay from Gatsby's crib with their douchey old money husband Tom Buchanan. After being blue ball for years, Jay and daisy finally started hooking up. Unfortunately they do a good job at keeping it away from daisy's hobby who gets his revenge by telling her how gatsby made all his bucks. Bootlegging. Yeah, that boy gatsby a hospital man and another twist face. He decides to stick it out with her dead beat. Husband girl just can't handle the thug life at Gatsby side. I thought she was a ride or die chick. Daisy. I'm disappointed. It looks like they couldn't be worse with team gatsby until holy time side bitch gets run over by daisy and the girl husband fades. Gatsby was behind the wheel. That dead chick's crazy as hubby.

Speaker 2:          04:07          Hands down to gatsby's mansion and glasses him in his swimming pool. It's game over for the great gatsby. Why did things go south for great gatsby? Maybe it was because his whole approach to life will straight up whack. Rather thought he can buy his way back to happiness. Well, the gangster wide, but daisy ain't one of his pants and shirts that a human and the human heart and the kind of thing you can buy on Amazon. You got to go on the black market, but that kind of crazy becoming rich didn't make me any happier than being rich did for daisy. I mean, just look at her. She's a top shelf social light on a surface, but her heart is busted. Her marriage sucks, and she's shallow as even nick thought Gatsby's Corny as view of daisy being all perfect wasn't jiving with reality. The character was capable of achieving their happiness they really wanted, which might be why so many people compare the great gatsby to the failure of the American dream.

Speaker 2:          05:07          What is the American dream? Well, it depends on who you ask, but it boils down to busting your ass too. You get enough bread to buy whatever makes you happy. Does the American dream holed up in practice? Well, in the Great Gatsby, the verdict is Hell No. All the American dream got Jay Gatsby was a death sentence for vehicular homicide. Gee, thanks for driving, Miss Daisy. Number one, Bilbo Baggins, the Hobbit by j Dot r dot tolkien. Bilbo baggins is a fat ass hobbit who likes to eat, glaze up and do Jack to one day some nappy wizard crashed his crib with a team of dwarves and invited him to retake the lonely mountain and all this prejudice from the dragon smile. Damn. That must've been some Danville. Va was cheap and after major grubbing billable, joins the gang on a fantastic journey. Pack with stranger things. Then we seen on stranger things, we're talking problems.

Speaker 2:          06:06          Trolls, a magic ring that Bilbo pockets and an enormous dragon tiller. Top amount of blame. Smile gets it correct and the doors reclaimed their mouth. The fastest thing you can say, my precious five armies hustle over and start scrapping over the recovered loop. This results in the climactic battle of the five arms. Luckily though bill on ducks, the dramas of Bob's the little shoddy pieces out, what only a small percentage is prize money, but it's all good. He hurries home as fast as it's bad. Last can carry them because you know what? That money's going up in smoke. Y'All. If you wonder why Bilbo didn't help himself to more of the recovery swag, it might be because so much of the crazy in the hobbit goes down because of good old fashioned greed. Consider the dwarves and session to reclaim the mountain. Something Thorn. Oh, concealed leader of the dwarves regretted as he lay dying.

Speaker 2:          07:05          If more of US valued food, cheer and song above, hoarded cold, he says the bill Bilbo. It wouldn't be a merrier world. Just about everyone in the hobbit got their minds on the treasure, which might explain why talking chose Bilbo is his main character. As a Hobbit, there's a childlike innocence to him living a simple life. I like the dragons doors and who all about the money and the power was turned off by greed. That's probably tokens killed that we should as well. That's it. Google does things up the middle earth by swiping out. One ring from the Creta Gollum. What's this? Greed. I wasn't talking. Setting up his future books. What's the difference? Because you know someone was seeing dollar signs with that move. Shout out to Pete Jackson, three hobbit movies for, and that's all the goods I got today. Be sure to be on the lookout for more nodes.
