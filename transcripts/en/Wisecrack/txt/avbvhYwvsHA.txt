We have nothing to lose, but our chains so have matt stone and Trey Parker turned against big business like the Denisons of South Park.

First, a quick recap in unfulfilled and Amazon fulfillment center comes to town where a workplace accident crushes. A guy named Josh and surviving organs are crammed in a box. The box opens. I spill out and guide his box. Oregon's agitate for working class rebellion, causing Amazon's employees to go on strike. Meanwhile, the kids want to flex at the bike parade to get girls, but can't deck out their bikes without their Amazon packages. Then in bike parade mall workers tried to break the strike and anyone willing to help Jeff Bezos gets their orders fulfilled. Once Kenny's newfound socialist beliefs ruined their plans for the parade. Yeah, I can do the bike. Why not?

Speaker 1:          02:20          Commodity fetishism the boys try to get it canceled. Meanwhile, Randy struggling. We'd business gets a boost from everyone jones for their Amazon packages stoned in content. The citizens of South Park realized they'd rather keep their tegrity than suck [inaudible] to figure out what Matt and Trey are saying about the economy. We have to start with this intro montage of the Amazon fulfillment center.

Speaker 2:          02:41          You load 16 tons a day, older and deeper in debt.

Speaker 1:          02:47          The song playing 16 tons has a million covers, but the original was written by Merle Travis about the life of coal miners in Kentucky. The song highlights the troubles of living in company hounds. A common practice that faded out in the middle of the 20th century. Company towns were places where a single employer dominated economic life, sometimes companies would open a factory and literally build the housing schools and hospitals for its employees, but more importantly, companies would pay their employees with their own version of vbox bucks that were only redeemable at company owned businesses. What resulted was functionally slavery with extra steps workers could never move because all their savings were useless outside of the company store dot

Speaker 3:          03:30          or don't check out on MCOs, go

Speaker 1:          03:34          to the company stone and running up a debt at the company store would further obligate you to stay until you paid it off. So it South Park Calling Amazon a modern day company town. Sure Amazon isn't paying people in prime box and there's no debt slavery either, but Amazon does seem to infiltrate every aspect of south park life. Once you got on tap, Amazon, Amazon light and Amazon Ipa, but especially in episode 10, we see that the primary motivation for working at Amazon is to buy your kids more stuff from Amazon. Mr Stacia's motivation for going back to work is to have his orders fulfilled for butters, peacock bike and like the Merle Travis Song, your paycheck has a way of ending up right back into the company store,

Speaker 3:          04:17          loading up forklift, getting paper cuts from boxes, and for what a measly paycheck. They just barely covers our online purchases

Speaker 1:          04:25          and while the people of south part in theory could take their real dollars to some other businesses to show hints at how big business coming to town can create eight, not so free market. When the boys try to find supplies to protest the bike parade, all the other businesses have gone under. When the Amazon fulfillment center open to everything else went out of business. A similar dynamic happens not just with Amazon, but Walmart were low paid employees only had enough money to shop at Walmart. You get a discount working here 10 percent. That means the baguettes or even better, ensuring the destruction of local businesses driving more people to work at Walmart and. Well, you get it. This problem seems encapsulated by Jeff Bezos is term consumer worker

Speaker 3:          05:06          Lauren, between classes, customers and workers. At us, all I've done is create the new class, the consumer worker

Speaker 1:          05:14          doubling down on the same sense of resignation that pervades the season. People support a company they don't even like because they feel they don't have any choice.

Speaker 3:          05:22          I want to quit working for Amazon. I want to join my friends and striking, but I know that you have to have your stuff to be happy.

Speaker 1:          05:31          This hopelessness is also a nod to the real life bidding war to host Amazon second headquarters. As you probably know, Matt stone and Trey Parker are libertarians, and the last two episodes seem to further a criticism of government involvement in the market, specifically the way business minded politicians get in bed with giant corporations to create a grotesque version of the free market. If the workers are selling their soul to the company, store towns and governments are selling their soul to Jeff Bezos is throbbing.

Speaker 4:          05:57          We had a deal. You told me this town would be the perfect place for one of our fulfillment centers.

Speaker 1:          06:02          The creation of jobs holds local governments functionally hostage to their whims. Perhaps you should no longer be a prime member, and while, yes, Amazon fulfillment centers are a good example, you could easily replace Amazon with any sports stadium or manufacturer seeking tax breaks that forced local governments into a race to the bottom and deals that leave them another day, older and deeper in debt. In short, the show criticizes the imbalance of power between companies like Amazon and local communities and their workers. Amazon dehumanizes the strikers when their status is downgraded from rhyme to Amazon. USD. A choice as in me and Josh does humanity is exactly what gets him killed when Amazon labels is death. Human error. So is there any escape from this nightmare? Well, sort of as randy bemoans the strike messing up his business, customers start lining up at his door. Hey, are you selling weed? Uh, yeah. My wife is going nuts not getting her packages. I told her I find her some Kush local competition soon forces randy to optimize convenience by delivering weed to people's homes. Starting an APP. We haven't happened out and even a membership program,

Speaker 5:          07:11          we're just making sure folks are aware.

Speaker 1:          07:14          In other words, he becomes the Amazon over week. So what is South Park trying to say here? Well, on the one hand, that integrity in business usually doesn't mean going all the way back to the gnomes episode of season two. We see that small business can be just as evil and exploitative as big bad horror books. We're just using those boys for our benefit. They have no idea what they're saying, but kids are great to get people on our side and 20 years later South Park's message hasn't deviated much.

Speaker 5:          07:43          You know what they got? They got these days.

Speaker 1:          07:47          You mean the things that almost killed us on Halloween? Yeah. I remember.

Speaker 5:          07:51          Why do we use scooters to get directly to the customers?

Speaker 1:          07:56          Those things that were once devoid of tegrity are now the vehicles with which he sells tegrity wheat and of course the episode ends with this. You come in giant online retailer near you complain all you want about hotbox, Walmart or Amazon. They're just going to get replaced by something equally sinister because at the end of the day, if I don't get my gamecube adapter for smash brothers by Wednesday, I swear to God, I'm burning this to the ground. What's interesting is that the strikers and our Marxist in a box are casting a pretty sympathetic light. Sure. Jeff Bezos has this to say about Josh.

Speaker 4:          08:33          See how the box ridiculous commercialism in order to try and feel better about itself,

Speaker 1:          08:37          a sentiment of resentment echoed by the boys as they try to cancel the bike grade to obscure their own failure. We're never going to win the bike ride, but if we get a canceled, then everybody loses. But as what the rest of the season, the message seems to be resignation. Strikers are encouraged to cross picket lines to appease their materialistic children. Others kids on bikes, and maybe

Speaker 4:          08:56          you won't get off your ass and work. Dad

Speaker 1:          08:59          and Josh gets ripped open by a mob of gift hungry kids. Jeff Bezos, as Josh says, it makes too many useful things resulting in too many useless people, but it seems we can't resist. You need your Amazon prime shows in your music and your books and your things delivered to your door like little presents to yourself. In true south park fashion are only savior is a fake one, a fake claim to authenticity in the form of integrity that ends up just being repackaged and sold by a huge online retailer. Even though it's a functional Amazon, we're reminded

Speaker 5:          09:29          you don't want to be elite because the elites gotten old integrity.

Speaker 1:          09:33          Even our anti consumers to send is just a regular part of the business cycle. It's not that integrity save south park, but the cynical interest of randy packets tegrity, I got more money now because integrity, that's because I figured out how to get tired. Everyone was once supposed to be a counter. Cultural rejection of modern life becomes a symbol for the commodification of dissent. The bike parade, which was once a pond and Jeff Bezos, the scheme to break the strike is now sponsored by tegrity. We'd citywalk and Taco South Park to seems content to bask in cynical tegrity. As the boys tried to cancel the bike parade, it becomes clear that the parade is a metaphor for the show and its marketing campaign. Hashtag cancer South Park,

Speaker 5:          10:15          we demand you canceled the bike parade. It is an added touch with progressive day.

Speaker 4:          10:21          Everything out there is getting canceled, but when it comes to us, we just can't do it. I mean, are we supposed to just keep going? Just go on making total assets of ourselves,

Speaker 1:          10:33          just that south park was promoting itself with a half serious critique of itself. The show is content to continue basking in the business of selling television ads where they have serious critique of consumers.
