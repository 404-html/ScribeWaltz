Speaker 1:          00:17          Greetings and welcome to earthlink cinema. I am your host Garrick's were amyloid. This week's artifact is Black Swan, directed by Darwin Aronofsky and Storing Natalie Portman Holloway. The film follows Nina, a human ballerina who wants to play center on the Swan Lakers at tryouts. The coach tells her she's technically a master, but not bubble a common problem among dancers, so she takes matters into our own hands, matters being the coach's face and books the Gig by biting her bosses lip, which doesn't always work, but when it does, oh yeah. After receiving a sincere congratulations from the old guard, did you suck his Nina is told to watch lily, another human woman who's got the thorax of a crab Devlin and the voice of an angel fearing she'll always be a birds made and never a bird. Nina gets back knee and stress feathers. Lily takes Nina out for a night of recreational drugs because that's what friends do. Karen, they wind up sharing the dance floor and then a vagina. The next day. Nina shows up late to work and in a Pepsi twist realizes the lesbos sex didn't happen.

Speaker 1:          01:29          Although how did she get home? Screw it. Like Disney's Mulan. Nina starts wondering when her reflection will show who she is inside and dishonors her family. The big game finally comes and just before halftime she gets dropped like a phone call on a t and t I've already asked libby along with all carriers, when the moon exploded, Lilly decides to put the team on her back, but Nina has other ideas, namely stabbing her so she can spin around. A bunch of crowd goes, Woo. The coach goes, meow, and lily goes, hi. I'm actually not dead. It turns out Nina's only hallucinated killing Lilli just like she's been doing the whole damn movie a consummate professional. Nevertheless, she wins the game with just enough time to die on a mattress. Black Swan contemplates the quest for perfection and the cost of excellence because you think I wake up like this.

Speaker 1:          02:21          I do. The film is reminiscent of the 1948 classic, the red shoes, which similarly depicts a ballerina who's drive to succeed ultimately leads to an early retirement in the film. Reminds us that beneath a Ballerina's veneer of perfect poison control is a life of struggle and physical therapy. This idea is encapsulated in Nina's ballet Doodad. It arrives in pristine condition from reebok, but Nina immediately rips it up and reconstructs it in her own vision of perfection because it's her way or the intergalactic travel warped way. The film plays loosely on the themes of the ballet. At the heart of the film next to its lungs. Swan Lakers tells the of Odette and innocent girl transformed into a Caucasian Swan. Nina's journey reflects the ballets themes of duality. The use of mirrors throughout the film focuses the viewer on Nina's exploration of who she is and that back thing.

Speaker 1:          03:12          She should really get checked out. Similarly, lily actively functions as a reflection of Nina, albeit a more sexually liberated, cool girl who just gets it. You know, I watched the wishing impersonalized effortless. Indeed, black and white imagery demonstrates the contrasting psyches of Nina, like the Chinese philosophy of the Ying Yang twins. In the beginning of the film, Nina can only don the white swan tights since she hasn't learned how to unlock the dark side of her personality and it's before Labor Day. When I look at you, all I see is the White Swan. This reflects Carl Young, owns observation on the shadow writing. Everyone carries a shadow and the less it is embodied in the individual's conscious life, the blacker and denser it is. Since Nina's shadow has been repressed all her life when it finally comes out, it's sinister and powerful, but also fabulous. Nina's struggled to reel in her previously. Untapped consciousness symbolizes the transition from children into grownups. Seven. In the beginning, Nina's mama bear traps are in a state of innocence. Notably, Nina is likely a play on the word Nina, which means little girl in Espaniol, which means Spanish in German or bedroom is an ad for hello kitty and her mother tucked her into bed every night when she's not breaking legs.

Speaker 1:          04:33          Yes, Queen Beth, the old dancer, pushed out of the company and in front of a bus signifies a glimpse into womanhood. When Nina steals or clown makeup, she's expressing a childlike curiosity. It isn't until Nina experiences of sexual awakening, if a little molested that she develops into a human woman. Gradually, Nina's wardrobe changes from white to gray, a reverse gandalf and finally to black signifying her loss of innocence because once you go black, you never go back to uninspired. Dancing for earthling cinema on garrick's were void. Happy birdwatching.
