Speaker 1:          00:03          Wisecrack jared here and today we're talking about a game that was seemingly made for us. Perhaps the most overly philosophical game ever seen a specimen that shows quite near Automaton. Near Automaton is a game about three androids to be as in or not to be. The moody nine s and the jaded did a too along the way. They fight adorable button, lethal machines and eventually each other on a futuristic earth where the line between right and wrong is taking a vacation and is never coming back. The world of New York automaton is crawling with machines named after philosophers who you must be friend or be head mostly the latter, but these wisdom loving death bots aren't always just throw away characters. They often point toward the complex philosophy at the heart of the game, at its core near Automata challenges, players to consider how we make meaning and truth, who we are as gamers and why video games matter.

Speaker 1:          00:55          Welcome with this wisecrack addition on the philosophy of near Automaton. This video was made in collaboration with an awesome channel called extra credits. You could catch a link to them and their video on near Automaton at the end of this episode and if you're visiting us from extra credits, welcome and be sure to subscribe. Oh, and watch out major spoilers ahead. The story takes place on earth more than 9,000 years in the future and follows two groups of Automaton. There's androids designed to hold human consciousness, but who eventually develop independent thought and machines were created by the aliens that invaded earth. Androids in machines fight a genocidal proxy war on behalf of their masters. Though the player mostly controls android characters. Choosing sides is not that easy because by the games halfway point we learned both humans and aliens have been dead for Millennia. Humans were already extinct. When the aliens attack absent their creators, androids and machines are forced to make meaning for themselves and if possible, stop seeing each other as enemies. The fact that both humans and aliens or dead is not only a central plot twist, it encapsulates the games existential philosophy. In fact, two B's opening line.

Speaker 2:          02:02          I often think about the God who blessed us with this cryptic puzzle and wonder if we'll ever have the chance to kill him. Might

Speaker 1:          02:09          as well have been polled right from Friedrich Porn Stache Nisha who wrote God is dead. God remains dead and we have killed him. Now I know the phrase God is dead gets thrown around a lot by internet edge lords, but what did Nisha actually mean before Nicha many thinkers constructed reality in a similar way. God, truth and reason, we're all unfathomable, unchanging, and universal concepts which stood above or outside of humankind, like supernatural forces animating the world and moving it toward progress. In this view, humans don't make and control meaning themselves. It's some unreachable datey or universal principle which gives human action, meaning when Nisha declared God dead, he criticized any system that locates the source of meaning outside human lives and popularize the idea of nihilism is the belief that there is no great metaphysical forest propelling us through the world and making our lives special.

Speaker 1:          03:06          Existence can be beat and there's no grander meaning to comfort us. No puppet master to save us. Now I know we can find each other in a lot of pop culture, but no piece of media embodies it quite like near Automaton. Androids and machines think they're god, like masters are literally above them on the moon and in space, but those gods are actually dead like rotting for Millennia, dead and as we learned from Adam and eve, machines killed their alien overlords because they were static and unchanging, much like the unchanging day at ease and morals that nature criticized.

Speaker 2:          03:41          They were saying almost like

Speaker 1:          03:47          humans died after the mainframe holding their consciousnesses collapses. Guess nobody made backups. If the death of God is really about the death of a grand meaning, then our dead aliens and humans are only one element of the games. Greater message about meaning you kill some a philosophies, biggest heroes. Some characters lose sight of a purpose in life and the game repeatedly builds meaning around certain characters or plots and then kills them off usually by the player's own hand. Each time this happens, the player has to reevaluate where their new meaning mission and direction is going to come from. Even your hobby android organization eventually dies, but your highs less like a god and more like acd government. They know humanities dead, but hide it from the other androids pretty fucked up, right? Your hot perfectly exemplifies the Nietzschean point that even once God, six feet under society doesn't just reboot. Political. Social and psychological norms are left over from prior belief systems and we continue imposing these meanings on one another and ourselves to be at nine s spend much of the b play throughs, reassuring one another. That machines don't have emotions or personhood,

Speaker 2:          04:53          they don't have any feelings. They're just imitating human speech.

Speaker 1:          04:57          Even when all evidence points to the contrary child, no need for human masters to promote this idea. They do it to each other. For Nisha, the best response to a meaningless universe and a dead God is to create meaning for ourselves or what he referred to as self making. In near Atomico we encounter different machines named after philosophers engaged in this kind of self making each with their own responses to the meaning or meaninglessness of light. There are quite a few existentialist machines to be found. John Paul as in Sartre, simone as in Diboll, Voila. Pascal as in Pascal and Kierkegaard as in Kierkegaard. Each philosopher machine offers us a glimpse into one way of pursuing meaning. Take John Paul the Avatar of John Paul Sartre in the game. Jp is basically a dark parody of his real life self, just like Sartre, loathed institutional recognition. John Paul is kind of an asshole who ignores, is devoted followers except for the pretty ones and eventually soft to the wilderness to find meaning.

Speaker 1:          05:58          Nobody really misses him, but before leaving John Paul highlights the game steams when he throws around one or two famous Sartre isms like the existential slogan, existence precedes essence essentially, rather than some innate nature determining who we are before we're born. Each individual first exists in the world and then develops meaning and purpose. It's all about radical freedom to become who we are through our actions and choices in the game. We see this everywhere. As machines transcend their intended purpose and find new meaning. Even the pods proved that their nature comes from existence, not a predetermined essence as they developed self consciousness.

Speaker 1:          06:38          In fact, most of the characters in the game are, as Sartre, once suggested, condemned to be free. That's right, condensed because without a higher power or innate nature, controlling our actions, we bear ultimate responsibility for our decisions even as virality becomes super ambiguous and that's a tough place to be. Just look at machines like this, sad angles, boss who like many of the Games characters is crushed beneath the weight of figuring out what's right and he knows he bears full responsibility for those decisions. The simone boss named after Simone de Beauvoir, a French feminist philosopher, holds a mirror to another aspect of meaning making. DEPA famously suggested one is not born a woman, let becomes a woman as the Simone boss realizes, one way we create meaning in our lives is by constructing gender norms like beauty and femininity. She literally becomes a woman by constructing herself and cannibalizing other machines to approve her beauty.

Speaker 1:          07:33          Both Deborah voir and her demented avatar teach us to watch out less. We become monsters in our attempt to make meaning through gender norms. Someones existential quest for connection through beauty is highlighted in her obsession with John Paul, which has historical roots since debois and start. We're lifelong lovers. The character pascal packs one of the biggest Nietzschean punches, though he's the Avatar of Blaise Pascal, a mathematician, philosopher, and regular renaissance man. He couldn't be more different than his real life counterpart. As the pacifist leader of a machine village, Pascal puts a lot of faith and the ultimate goodness of machines and Androids, but the real pascal was a bit of a downer. Unlike his idealistic Avatar, the Real Pascal thought humanity was prideful, arrogant, and unredeemable without God. Our lives are filled with anxiety and despair. In fact, we have only one redeeming trait. The greatness of human beings consists in their ability to know their wretchedness.

Speaker 1:          08:31          But Game Pascal comes around to the Irl Pascal's viewpoint and maybe the games darkest twist. The peaceful villagers suddenly start eating each other, and when, even after setting aside his pacifism to defend the children, they commit suicide anyway, gained. Pascal finally understands the wretchedness of himself in the machine. When he despairs and asks you to kill him or delete his memory, the has to face their own wretchedness two and make a tough choice. Some characters in the near universe try to make meaning through new religions. Take Christian existentialist Soren Kierkegaard who makes an ironic appearance as the worship leader of a small cult. Kierkegaard believe that the ultimate expression of one's freedom is to commit to certain meaning and make it true by manifesting it in one's life, which he calls taking a leap of faith. Unfortunately, when some of QCC regards followers take literal leaps of faith, it doesn't turn out so well for that.

Speaker 1:          09:25          There are so many other philosophy bosses we could talk about. Call Gruen, Conte ankles, and mark's Ernst Bloch Hagle, even the brothers Friedrich in August, Schlegel Roshi, Koshi Boko, she and Sochi are the Japanese pronunciations of Chinese philosophers, Lao Tzu, Confucius Moats, and Juang. Quanta was a taoist philosopher who was in the existentialism way before. It was cool. He claimed existence is full of cycles of light and dark life and death and joy and sadness. Only by accepting these cycles including all the unpleasant stuff. Can we ever find contentment in life near Automaton, taking a cue from junk to bakes. These cycles right into the game played as an extension of the games. Existential themes. The mechanics emphasize the role of cycles and repetition in creating meaning. Cycles are everywhere. Androids are caught in the cycle of life, in debt, repeatedly uploading to the mainframe and getting new bodies to be is stuck in the cycle of killing dynastic and pod one 53 it gives a sad spiel about cycles of life.

Speaker 3:          10:28          Everything is designed to end.

Speaker 1:          10:30          It's all about returning to the beginning according to Nisha cycles. Dispel the myth of progress. Progress only makes sense if you have a clear aim and if you're cool staying on a path that someone else laid out for you, but nature hates that notion of progress. Instead, we should be critical of claims to progress that rely on external meaning or our unquestioned notions of right and wrong. The cycles and automaton disrupt this false idea of progress and meaning not only within the game universe but also for the player in Automaton. There is no clear goal or rather gold changed throughout the game. And the whole point is that none of the characters are on a predetermined path. Plus there's no straight forward game progress. Players literally repeat certain actions or stories rather than moving linearly from one event to the next. The game even ends with the suggestion that eight to a nine s will be reborn to fight this battle all over again.

Speaker 3:          11:23          They are perpetually trapped in a never ending spiral of life and death.

Speaker 1:          11:29          In fact, relationship between cycles and nature are most obvious in the games. Multiple play through structure in Automaton. The main play throughs a, b, c, d, n, e, r like chapters carefully sequenced and building on one another, often repeating parts of the same plot, but through the eyes, knowledge and powers of different characters. And sometimes moving onto the next plot stage, you must complete a through d to get to the main ending e with the credits which we'll talk about in a moment. Uh, Tamatoa uses this structure to strip meaning from the players themselves and to put the idea of game progress engaging players in their own nihilist quest instead of the difference between the first and second play throughs where you play as to be. And then nine s in parallel stories in the first play as to be you learn the aliens are dead and the machines we've been killing are actually sentience and emotional.

Speaker 1:          12:18          Of course they could have just told us this straight out, but instead they make us relive every thing we did to those poor bastards and now we feel terrible about it. The real importance of the first run is to set up meaning yours, who you are and why you're fighting the bad guys and then snatch it from us. The point is really driven home by the beginning of the second play through where you played from the perspective of a machine red shirt. This opening seems designed to trigger the players compassion and rob us of the meaning we use to make sense of our entire first quest.

Speaker 1:          12:52          Instead of creating a grand narrative to explain away pain and loss or instead of just giving up meat you suggest we say yes to life. Yes. Saying is an attitude oriented toward the future that affirms everything from the past without trying to change it. Imagine you had to live the same life over and over and what Nisha calls eternal recurrence. This would be super crappy if you thought life was about avoiding pain and suffering, but yes, saying embraces suffering and the lessons if brings us without glorifying them. The game's final Nietzsche and middle finger to progress and ultimate meaning comes in ending eat here. Players literally have to kill their gods and make a difficult choice between progress, which lets them save all their data and advancement in the game and yes, saying which entails accepting their mistakes and be willing to start over as the credits roll and you battled the names of the games, designers and creators which are somehow shooting that you messages from other players around the world encourage you until you're finally joined by their avatars who sacrifice themselves for your success.

Speaker 1:          13:52          And I don't use sacrifice lightly. As you discover at the end when you're asked to do the same, all those avatars are there because in some other time in place, maybe before you even started playing other players finish the game and chose to delete their data and game saves for the ability to eventually help you a total stranger. Complete the game. Here we're asked what makes gaming meaningful? Do we believe in the myth of progress that what makes them meaningful is completing them, saving our data and having achieved something once and for all or are we yes sayers willing to start over from the beginning and make the same choices and maybe even the same mistakes all over again? Are we individual automaton will only fight for ourselves or is gaming about the lessons we learn and engaging a community? Does one player deserve the sacrifice made by others and should we sacrifice ourselves for people who we don't know or might not even like what makes gaming meaningful is truly up to the player. If you affirm progress, nothing happened. But if you say to suffering and loss instead all your saves in play get deleted and you return to the beginning to do it all again or maybe you'll do it differently.

Speaker 4:          15:01          A future you must take for yourself.

Speaker 1:          15:07          See cycles as a game near Automaton itself embraces suffering both of its characters and its players, but only in order to tell a powerful philosophical story as only an interactive game could does it pan out like they hoped? Is the game worth all the fields that elicits in an attempt to make its point about meaning? Well that's up to you, but if you're one of the yes heirs who sacrifice made my journey possible, you should know it means something to me and part of the reason it means something to me is because this ending is a rare example of game developers baking empathy into the game play well. Video Games are on the surface all about saving the world and helping people. Most of them lack core components of what makes acts truly empathetic. To learn more about how near Automaton breaks the mold. You'll have to check out our collaborators over at extra credits who are broken down the ending in a whole new light.
