Speaker 1:          00:03          There's been a lot of talk over the past few years. Um, and in some popular books about the power of intuition and how if we trust that our intuitions or went with our guts more often, we would actually wind up making better decisions in the world would even be a better place. Some researchers have talked about how our intuitions and the intuitive judgments we can make, the snap judgements are actually accurate a lot of the time. And a lot of that is true. But what we noticed when thinking about our gorilla experiment and doing research for this book is that there's a whole category of intuitions that are actually systematically wrong and in very dangerous ways. And those are the intuitions we have about how our own minds work. So the gorilla experiment shows that we intuitively think that we pay attention to a notice much more than we actually do.

Speaker 1:          00:46          And that can have tragic consequences if you get into a car accident or at one of the examples in our book is a nuclear submarine that surfaced right into a Japanese fishing boat because in part the captain of the submarine looked up in the periscope, didn't see any boats around and surface right into one that he didn't see. That was actually probably right in front of him. So there's a case where intuitively we think something and it can really get us into big trouble. We realized as we were thinking about the book and putting together the idea is that this category of intuitions is very broad. It's not just about visual attention, it's also about memory. We think we remember things much more accurately than we really do. I, it's about confidence. We think that people who are confident are also more skilled and accurate and knowledgeable. It's about our own knowledge. We think that we know and understand more about the world and we really do and so on. They're sort of like a whole sort of set of these intuitions which, um, can really lead us astray if we're not aware of them. And that's what we decided to write the book about.

Speaker 1:          01:46          We are in a way, taking on the impression that a lot of people have from books like blink by Malcolm Gladwell and others in that category, which is sort of an uncritical belief in the power of intuition and snap judgments and so on. And the idea that, um, you should rely on them whenever possible. Um, we sort of are, uh, in a sense taking on the cult of intuition or the myth of intuition as we call it in the book. I should also say that we're very pleased at Malcolm gladwell actually read our original scientific journal Article about the invisible gorilla study and talked about it and one of his New Yorker articles, which helped it get more publicity and ultimately led to it becoming more widely known, uh, and as famous as it is.
