Speaker 1:          00:03          Hey wise, crack jared again and today we're talking about everyone's favorite anime with an uncomfortable amount of underage crotch fondling a curatory, Aamas enduring and much beloved dragon ball. Dragon ball may appear to be little more than a run of the mill adventure show for kids. The series and it's spinoffs actually have roots in some pretty hefty philosophical material. Many fans are aware that in creating the earliest episodes of Dragon Ball, Toyama drew inspiration from a 500 year old Chinese classic journey to the West. These superficial similarities are easy to spot. Both feature a group of four adventurers in search of powerful magical objects among them, a monkey like creature with a magic staff, a horny piggish looking fellow, et cetera. Often overlooked, however is the fact that dragon ball, much like journey to the West can be read as an explicitly Buddhist allegory. Indeed a show that many of us watched in our underwear on Saturday mornings while wolfing down cookie, Chris offers a surprising take on fundamental elements of Buddhist doctrine.

Speaker 1:          01:01          Welcome his wise crack addition on the philosophy of dragon ball and note to the die hard fans keeping score at home. Since a full discussion of the extended Dragon Ball universe would take quite a while. Today we'll focus mainly on the episodes of the original animate most heavily influenced by journey to the west, the 13 episodes comprising the emperor loft saga. But first a quick refresher. Dragonball follows Goku a young boy with a monkey tale and superhuman strength and Bouma a girl who plans to collect the dragon balls in order to wish for a new boyfriend. Along the way, the team up with oolong a shape shifting pig and yum cha, a desert dwelling band that with a crippling fear of women, they are in a race against time to collect all seven dragon balls before the evil emperor Pilaf can snag them for himself. At the last moment when Pilaf has gathered all the dragon balls and it's about to wish for world domination, Oolong saves the day by sabotaging his wish.

Speaker 1:          02:01          journey to the west follows trip, hit tikka a Buddhist monk and his three disciples, monkey pigs, he and sandy on their quest to locate and bring back sacred Buddhist scrolls to the Chinese court. When the pilgrims arrived at the Buddhist paradise, the scrolls they received out to be completely blank. While journey to the West involves character searching for a magical object, there's more to it than your basic annoying fetch quests. The novel is often read as a Buddhist allegory, one concerned with spiritual enlightened. The characters move from a place of ignorance to one of insight as they get closer to their destination. Surprisingly enough, the same applies to dragonball. Both Dragon Ball and journey to the West have their philosophical grounding. In Mahayana Buddhism de Vastly oversimplified the Mayana approach to Buddhism is distinguished from the earlier teravata school. Nice emphasis on the collective enlightenment of all sentient beings in the universe rather than that of any one individual.

Speaker 1:          02:53          Accordingly, dragon ball puts a premium on acts of compassion and on the growth of the group as a when the heroes are dragging a ball. Put others first. They advance in their quest when they act selfishly and refuse to see things from other's point of view. Their progress is delayed. In the second episode, Goku and Boma encounter a beach turtle who explains that he's lost. I wish there was a way we could help you. Hey, I know. What do you like me to carry you to the scene? Mr Turtle while go, who wants to put their journey on hold in order to help the turtle? Boma wants to get right back to her quest to find the dragon ball.

Speaker 2:          03:26          We're on an adventure. We don't have time to transport a beach turtle. Okay.

Speaker 1:          03:31          However, go coups. Active compassion unexpectedly turns out to be the most direct route to the next dragonball. Enter master Roshi hermit and pervert. Extraordinary Roshi is grateful to go Ku for returning the turtle to the sea and gives Goku his iconic flying Nimbus cloud as a reward. You also happens to own a dragon ball, which he's willing to give the boma and exchange for. Well, it's a weird show guys. The ethical implications of trading peep shows for magical jewelry aside. The fact remains that Boba and Goku find the dragonball because Goku is willing to delay his own gratification and rover to help out a fellow being in need. So aren't you glad we decided to help the turtle now it paid off.

Speaker 2:          04:15          I sure am. You are so right.

Speaker 1:          04:18          You don't have that. I think about it as the series goes on. Goku spends a lot of time dragging around his useless childhood friends while doing all the world. Yeah, I'm looking at you. Crillon did that ain't compassion. I'm not sure. What is this correlation between ethical behavior and speed of progress is lifted straight from journey to the West in which a lack of compassion on part of the pilgrims causes delays that can only be resolved through compassion and understanding. Monkey often gets in fights with monsters only to realize that those monsters were supposed to help him. Both Peggy and sandy start out his foes only to eventually become allies. This goes part of the way toward explaining early dragon balls, unexpected attitude toward violence for a franchise that would eventually go on to features, scenes such as this, this, this, this, and this.

Speaker 1:          05:13          Dragon ball and its earliest episodes as a surprising lack of violence like journey to the west. The show is preoccupied with a particular Buddhist conception of nonviolence. Violence is not universally wrong so much as it is cumbersome to some degree. It does get in the way of insight. Conversely, compassion facilitates spiritual progress. This understanding of violence as roadblock is most clearly displayed with the ox cake. When the group first meets the ox, King Goku tries to beat him up in order to clear the pathway of Fire Mountain and take his dragon ball. The enormous man barely feels go cruise attacks for the duration of this fight. Everyone involved is stuck in an unproductive, pointless cycle that gets the pilgrims nowhere. It is only when Goku and the ox king begin to each other's needs through conversation that the team gets any closer to their goal. We are collecting these and I think you have one.

Speaker 1:          06:05          I think I've seen one in my cousin so of course you could have it. My new little friend, compassion and understanding rather than violence lead to the trade that eventually nets the team. Another dragon ball, which is all well and good when you're dealing with a scary but ultimately harmless threat like the ox king. But how should our heroes approach a threat that can't be reasoned with? According to writer Paul, our Fleischman, the Buddhist approach to nonviolence makes room for this kind of scenario as he says, permitting someone else to perpetrate harm without consequences is not nonviolence. Defending innocent lives with violent means is hardly ideal, but it's preferable to rigid pacifism. And the last few episodes of the emperor p Loft Saga, the team is confronted with an existential threat when Goku turns into a giant ape at the site of the full moon and threatens to eat boma.

Speaker 1:          06:53          So Yom Chupp wore an oolong cutoff. Go coos tail to safe Boma and stop Goku from doing something he'd later regret. They're limited use of violence prevents worst violence down the road. This way at least nobody dies. This more nuanced understanding of violence would pop up in Torrey aamas later work as well. Listen to go description of himself in response to freeze his question. Hello, how are you? Hi, I'm the hope of the universe. I am the answer to all living things that cry out for peace. I am protector of the innocent. I am the light in the darkness. I am true nightmare. Unlike the various villains that maim and murder throughout the series go Ku commits violent acts to preserve peace. Perhaps most interesting is how dragon ball handles the Buddhist concept of empties. The idea that things in themselves, how no inherent or fixed essence early on Toyama asks us to consider this concept in relation to the dragon balls are these gems have the power to do great things and not so great from the start.

Speaker 1:          07:56          The series points out that the dragon balls are neither inherently good, bad or anything in between there simply a store of potential energy use to fulfill wishes even so the hero's revere them as a life changing miracles. Their disposition toward the dragon balls mirrors the pilgrims attitude toward the sacred scrolls in journey to the west. When the Buddha's assistants actually give them scrolls that are blank, they are more than a little pissed off, but they shouldn't be. Scholar Andrew, who we are used at the blankness of the scrolls, is a material manifestation of the Buddhist doctrine of emptiness assigned pointing to the nature of ultimate reality. The Buddha himself explains to the pilgrims that as a matter of fact, it is such blank scrolls as these that are the true scriptures by undercutting their expectations. The Buddha provides the pilgrims with a profound lesson about the nature of reality, namely that it's empty of any inherent essence.

Speaker 1:          08:48          In this way, the prank actually advances their spiritual progress. A similar bait and switch occurs in dragon ball. Remember, oolongs panty wish by ruining pilafs wish oolong undercuts the hero's expectations, turning something as momentous as the summoning of the eternal dragon into a joke. While the dragon balls may have provided oolong with a pair of Panties, they haven't changed anyone's life in any meaningful way, which is not to say the journey was for nothing far from it in both the show and the novel. The revelation of the quests inherent emptiness serves as a catalyst for growth beyond what the characters expected. In the final chapters of journey to the west, the pilgrims are made into high ranking members of the Buddhist Paradise while the heroes of dragon ball gain insight into the true scope of their various problems, which turned out to be not as terrible or permanent as they thought.

Speaker 1:          09:36          Boma and Yom Cha plan to use the dragon balls to find a boyfriend and cure social anxiety respectively. But after long pulses stunt they realize the solution to their mutual problem has been in front of them the whole time. They agree to get together on the spot. Bobo lets go of her need for perfection and Yom sure lets go of his fear. Even Oolong who we first meet kidnapping young girls to staff his would be Harem has learned to find happiness in thinking about others. Besides himself. When asked whether he will accompany Yom trying boma to the city, he says, Oh wow, I guess I'll go. You guys need me. So turtles flashing panties and more. All in all a pretty weird way of getting a religious message across. But that's kind of the point. My Yana Buddhism with its emphasis on teaching and collective enlightenment is big into the concept of skillful means or the guiding of Cindy and beings toward enlightenment according to their current abilities and other words, meeting people where they're at.

Speaker 1:          10:30          One way to meet people where they're at is to dispense with the dry lecturing and tell them a damn good story and this is exactly what dragon ball and journey to the west do with engaging plotlines creative characters and writing that is alternatively tense and hilarious.
