Speaker 1:          00:00          This episode is brought to you by curiosity stream. What's up wisecrack Michael here. You may have heard me on our rick and Morty podcast where much to my dismay, jared has dubbed me Dr. Nihilism. I've also written some videos you might recognize like are always sunny episode, the gaze of the abyss episode, the philosophy of get out and more recently our Kayfabe episode. Today we're continuing our discussion on the only defense attorney who breaks the law more often than Michael Cohen, daredevil, Matthew Murdoch's Catholicism, has always been a defining element of his character and his distinguished him from most other nonreligious superheroes, but it's in this most recent season that Catholicism comes front and center to understand matthew struggle and why we think season three is so awesome. We'll have to dive into one of the most important questions that theologians have been struggling with for Millennia.

Speaker 1:          00:51          So join us as we break down how the man without fear that comes the man without faith in this wise crack. Quick take on daredevil season three and of course spoilers ahead. First, a quick recap, some months after the events of defenders, but presumably before the children of faint I was double parked their donut chip in Greenwich Village, Matt Murdock Awakens from a coma and the church run orphanage he was raised in. While the worst of his injuries have healed, his spirit remains broken. Daredevil is convinced that his crusade against injustice had ultimately failed. As such, he takes up residence in the chapel, undercroft retreating from society and allowing his public persona to remain dead to the world. This makeshift bat cave services one of the primary set pieces for the season and that constant conversations between Murdoch, fatherland and sister Maggie drive. Much of the engagement with maths, Catholic faith, or rather the lack thereof like lex luther and Batman versus Superman. Daredevil is blinded by the problem of evil, which lex summarizes as God is all powerful, cannot be all good, and it's all good and he can not be all powerful. In one scene, Murdoch in Paris has seemingly senseless suffering to that of Joe Story,

Speaker 2:          02:04          of God's perfect servant job prayed everyday, dawn with his knees on the ground and is facing the third slot of 10 goats, one for each of his children, burn them at the alter in God's honor, follow God soldiers. Joe, he was the most loyal. I know the story I met you and know what happens next, gotten murdered. All 10 of his children in cold blood scorched every inch of job's land lashed at his body to his skin was covered in bloody welts. God range misery on the life of his most perfect servant and still job and not cursing what I realized Joe was a pussy.

Speaker 1:          02:44          Matt wonders why God would not similarly speak to him whether God had really called him to the vocation of vigilante and whether God had brought about good through the devil of Hell's kitchen. Unlike the steadfastly faithful job, murdoch comes to the that God is not good. You might hate God right now, but the feeling is not mutual. No, I don't hate him.

Speaker 1:          03:07          I've just seen as true face as all and from the way things are going, it seems like he's not wrong. Throughout the season. More and more evidence mounts for God's indifference society seems irredeemably corrupt entirely under the control of Wilson Fisk, fisk bribes and black males, cops, feds, lawyers, judges and jurist, turning good citizens into criminals, law enforcers into lawbreakers, and the very institutions devoted to justice into instruments of injustice, given daredevils, Catholicism. It's after recall the words of Jesus. Do not fear those who can kill the body but cannot kill the soul. Rather fear Him who can destroy both body and soul. You know fisk in a nutshell. Oh, and we can't not mention the fact that this overweight and ostentatious New York real estate developer who's basically above the law suddenly takes up residence and a presidential hotel, not so subtle. Marvel daredevils, new founders, so theism. That is his anger and frustration at God amplifies his disgust with humanity. Thank Godfrey.

Speaker 3:          04:09          He didn't help you. I did.

Speaker 1:          04:12          He abuses his friends and is generally less interested in saving society. Then punching it in the face. Murdoch's broken relationships with both God and the people around him can be cast in Catholic terms as a failure to do what Jesus called the two greatest commandments, to love God and to love your neighbor as yourself, but this itself isn't unique to any specific religion. These two relationships represent the two basic axes which believers of most religions have to concern themselves with. When deciding how to navigate life is specially when sacred and secular duties seem to make different demands. It's here that Matthew directly confronts an issue Christianity has dealt with for centuries. How does one reconcile and obligation to God and an obligation to others is specially if there's others exist in a tainted, a moral world or in Christian parlance to be in the world but not of the world.

Speaker 1:          05:06          Theologian h dot Richard Niebuhr in his book, Christ and culture identify several basic answers that Christians have offered over the centuries for how to do so, and while he is specifically concerned with Christianity, his paradigm would mostly work within any religious tradition. Briefly, they can be called one separation to accommodation, free synthesis for paradox and five, transformation daredevils, Arkin season three season transition between two of these models for figuring out our relationship to God and man, separation and synthesis, the former, which Niebuhr also calls Christ against culture, prescribes a radical renunciation of end near total separation from the surrounding society. This is the path ascribed to you by monks and Mennonites. It's also exactly what daredevil does in the early when like the rest of us millennials, he moves back. Home is a grown ass adult to mooch off his parents living in their basement and having his mom cleaned his laundry.

Speaker 1:          06:06          Yes, really, and like a medieval monk, he's literally cloistered himself in a church. He treats his identity of Matthew Murdoch as dead to the world and spirits, his friendships with foggy and Karen, when they find out he is alive, he pushes them away, lies to them, steals from them, and treats them as mere instruments of his agenda. As daredevil has mat in the friend lately without a doubt, but deep down, I think it's hurting him as much as it's hurting us, is only engagement with the world is when he's punching it with his fist, which is one way to construe being against culture neighbor while affirming that each of his five models was partially correct and it times the appropriate answer, nevertheless, was particularly critical of the separation model as overly simplistic and ultimately futile. No one can completely closed themselves off to the outside world as daredevil discovered the hard way when Bullseye attack, St Patrick's.

Speaker 1:          07:03          It's the turning point of the season and particularly poignant and it's Catholic imagery, all of which make clear to murdoch that this separation model doesn't succeed in either serving his neighbors or the man upstairs. First bullseyes eyes attack is a violation of the long established norm of sanctuary. Karen page had sought safety there from the retribution of Wilson Fisk and by conspiring to murder her there kingpin and Bullseye committed particularly agregious sin in the eyes of Catholics who see violence on consecrated grounds as profaning something sacred. Then there's the murder itself, fatherland some sacrifices his own life upon the altar, saving Karen's his death is an unmistakable illusion to Christ claim I am the good shepherd. I lay down my life for the sheep pastor, deriving from the Latin for Shepard bullseyes diabolical attack, his violation of sanctuary and his martyrdom of father Lantam are all proof positive to murdoch.

Speaker 1:          07:59          That is flirtation with the for separation model is a failure. It's at this point that he [inaudible] the uniquely Catholic way of understanding how to deal with both God and the world which kneeboard calls this synthesis model. The synthesis model affirms that both the Sacred Institution of the church and the secular institutions of society are both means through which God brings about good. That includes the government as a means of bringing about justice, daredevils, embrace of the separation model, and the first half of the season coincided with his disillusionment with the legal system. He become convinced that the courts couldn't successfully serve as God's means for enacting justice against criminals such as fisk. So when he later reconnects with his friends and with them, uses the legal system to put kingpin back behind bars. We can see how it's a step towards affirming this synthesis model. Of course, Murdoch's returned to the fold.

Speaker 1:          08:52          It doesn't happen all at once, and daredevil tempted up until the climactic fight to kill the kingpin. But whereas in the first season, his temptation to finish off fisk was simply a struggle with the deadly sin of Wrath. Here it indicates Murdoch is still questioning whether God is using social institutions to bring about good or whether daredevil has to take matters into his own hands. At this point, Murdoch has rejected the separation, just approach, but it's not until the redemption of reign of diem that he wants again, fully affirms the Catholic approach of synthesis. Since the show start, Murdoch's core conviction has been that no one was past the point of redemption. Batman has his personal code against killing that's informed by the murder of his parents, but despite sharing a similar origin, the show is clear that read Batman, scruples came from his Catholic faith for Murdoch.

Speaker 1:          09:44          It'd be a moral to execute his enemies because he held hope that even someone so sinful as Wilson fisk might have a change of heart and repent, but it's not until this season that a character that had broke bad is shown to go good. Once again. FBI special agent reign of Diem is one of the many government officials blackmailed by FIS in addition to other crimes. Nadeem is the accomplished a eyes bullseyes murder of father Atlanta, and yet he's not beyond redemption. Nadeem agrees to testify against fisk knowing full well the danger of crossing his crime boss, and when fisk gets to the grand jury, making the turncoats testimony. Feudal Nadeem instead of running voluntarily lays down his life so that his dying deposition would send the king pin back to prison. And this is what finally restores Matt Murdock's. Faith seeing God appear to work, redemption in human hearts and justice through social institutions.

Speaker 1:          10:38          Not separately, but in synthesis with one another to bring about good in the world. This is the ultimate example of kneeboards synthesis, the vertical relationship to God and the horizontal relationship with man working together, the Vertical Relationship Aka Nadine's conscience. Getting to tuned is the thing which allows the horizontal relationship, Aka Society, including institutions such as the legal system to be the means by which God brings about justice. The two are working together in synthesis and without the vertical. The horizontal would have failed. The season ends with Murdoch having come through his crisis of faith. He's no longer sequestered away from society and the church basement, but preaching from the pulpit to his whole community. He's no longer a strange from his friends, but getting the gang back together in the form of Nelson Murdoch and paige attorneys at law and he's no longer blind to is God's goodness, but trying to see as much of it as possible.
