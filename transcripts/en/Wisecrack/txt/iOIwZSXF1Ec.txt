Speaker 1:          00:10          Hey, wise crack jared again. And today we're looking at the candy flavored fever dream that is adventure time with Finn and Jake. Now in their final season of adventures, we want it to look at what makes the show so special. And while there are lots of reasons people love adventure time, I'm going to argue it has a lot to do with a storytelling style as old as written storytelling itself and an epic to epic for most to finish d elliot. So let's see how adventure time tells a story. And as always spoilers ahead. Of course, some of the similarities to the classics of old come down to the Ed venturing part. The classics have monsters, dramatic rescues, long journeys to Distinct Kingdoms and a beautiful princess that sends soldiers to battle. The Elliot is also sometimes referred to as the song of helium and is written in verse giving it strong links to music. Likewise, adventure time features, plenty of music and songs throughout at seasons.

Speaker 2:          01:02          Thank you. Pancakes making big and pancakes takes a big enough to put it in a cake.

Speaker 1:          01:07          And characters even occasionally speak in rhyme. I've caught thumb thing for you. Oh my whole show, don't you know? Yeah. Might Stub your toe. The Elliot and adventure time. Also both start with a musical call to hear their story.

Speaker 3:          01:22          Thanks your time. Grab your friends to fairy dust and lands right.

Speaker 1:          01:28          But what really connects adventure time with epics like the Iliad, the Odyssey or the alien is a surprising one. The structure of poetry. Rebecca sugar, former adventure time writer, one set of show Creator Pendleton Ward. He's expressing thoughts about very modern feelings that people have. Good poetry is like that. Many of the things that venture time is known for have origins in poetry. It's mix of modern and classical language.

Speaker 3:          01:53          Fast, tight, you fun to do.

Speaker 1:          01:59          It's music. It's use of colorful and evocative imagery. The invention of new words, objects and creatures. Oh my God, you guys. Drama bomb and just how plain surreal at all is. But one of the most telling ways it relates to poetry is in its length adventure times episodes only last roughly 10 minutes, half your average TV show, which means each episode relies on compression. Can you hear any story? It's been compressed. It jettisons the boring details for the exciting stuff, classical poetry and a lot of modern poetry to hustle pre from rules on how this compression is achieved. The Elliot, for instance, compresses each line in toy form of poetic rhythm or meter called Deck Tilak Heck Salmon, which is a fancy way of saying each line must be exactly 18 silk. Almost all poetry, even if it doesn't use meter, is a mode of compression and sure movies compressed stories to a few hours.

Speaker 1:          02:51          TV compresses them to under an hour, but adventure time is even more hardcore compressing a whole story in to 10 minutes. This type of stripping down requires the essential elements be focused on in imaginative ways. In the episode [inaudible] Fin lives an entire lifetime in a pillow dimension or he gets married, has kids, and grows old all in 10 minutes. This economy of exposition shows how compression feeds creativity and helps focus the story and unlike other stories that get compressed in infuriating ways. Game of thrones season seven venture time uses this compression to be more outlandish. The first shot of boy features raining knives outside, which shows us why the characters are stuck indoors within the first second without having to tell us, but aside from just both poems and adventure time are short. We can also draw similarities between how they use these narratives. Snippets to tell a larger story.

Speaker 1:          03:44          Traditionally in an epic poem, the Iliad, the text is broken up into paragraphs called stanzas. Stanzas composed larger chapters called Cantos from the Italian word for song. You could see a season of a TV show as a canto and an episode as a stanza. The stands focuses on the individual and their feelings, a short vignette or seen. It gives an insight into someone's character even if it lasts a lifetime, like in the [inaudible] episode. It Canto, on the other hand is the accumulation of the scenes that tell the story of several characters or a whole world in Dante's inferno, another epic poem, the stands that will be a short interaction or description, but the canto will be the story of a whole circle of hell. Just like the Elliot and other epics. Adventure time tells it stories on a micro and macro level. Not only are there the contain narratives of each episode, but an overall narrative that reflects the history of the land of uz through dialogue, geography, and even just certain names.

Speaker 1:          04:40          We discover the different types of government and rulers. Who Has Kim, oh, Ooh, that the main deity is a cosmic owl and especially from the episode Simon and Marcy, it's hinted that ou was formed after a nuclear apocalypse. One of the most interesting ways in which adventure time can be compared to poetry is with something called Bathos. Bathos is a sort of anticlimax a sudden shift in tone or thoroughly mediocre and to a suspenseful moment. There are some great examples of this and the classics like the defeat of Achilles and invincible warrior brought down by the Lamest of weaknesses is heel and in paradise lost. We learned that divine angels defecate not through their poop shoots but from a kind of missed from their skin that is bathos something built up then brought crashing down to earth. Adventure time is full of this. Just when something gets too dangerous or scary, I have come for you or romantic, kiss me, Thin Amin, kiss me. Then it's either interrupted or undercut by another character undermining it or it off.

Speaker 4:          05:57          Yeah, busy crossing you, man. No, he's just hugging me gently.

Speaker 1:          06:03          Well, venture time is not the only show to use bath. Those for the sake of humor,

Speaker 5:          06:08          how things are going. Again, easy here. Ooh, child things, they'll get pride.

Speaker 1:          06:16          It certainly helps make some of the more creepy moments palatable to a younger audience. Beth, this is also often integral to the storytelling and the moral message of the show. Characters. Usually villains are introduced and dispensed with in an episode and even longstanding ones like the ice king develop using bathos. I was going to start up on the elliptical again, but I got depressed. Okay. One of the key lessons you learned from adventure time is prejudice is bad or the more cliched. Don't judge a book by its cover. This is accomplished by setting up a villain as evil and then finding out they're simply misunderstood as is.

Speaker 4:          06:50          I'm hot again. Thanks

Speaker 1:          06:52          dunes or a good guy who was a villain all along. This type of bathetic technique is used frequently in poetry, both from antiquity and today. It is also a linchpin for character arcs and adventure time and an integral part of how it tells its story. Although some sea adventure time as prime TV for stoners, I am the dream warrior. I have summoned you here to hang with me and you're together. Dream. Are you going to show us a move to beat the farm? There's a fierce fandom out there who have invested a lot of time interpreting the shows, rather fake narrative. The same can also be set up poetry, which can oftentimes seem intentionally cryptic end. Even though poetry isn't as cool as whoever this Jake Paul Dude is. Adventure time is a prime example of how millennia old poetic techniques are still being used to tell funny, sensitive, and downright weird stories and two extraordinary effect.
