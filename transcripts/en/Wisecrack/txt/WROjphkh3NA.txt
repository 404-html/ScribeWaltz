Speaker 1:          00:00          This video is brought to you by wix villains. Oftentimes, the best part of a movie can't live with them, can't feed them to a pack of rabid hyenas. Usually villains are the people we love to hate or fear with the occasional motor. Come have empathy, but something has been happening with villains lately. If you found yourself nodding along to the logic of a diabolical plot or feeling more empathetic than usual towards a film's antagonist, you're not alone. Today's villains from killmonger and Black Panther to screen slaver and incredible to have become weirdly relatable, each equipped with their own cogent critiques of the world. People will trade quality for ease every time. Villainy is and always has been a reflection of the value systems and fears of the time. So how did we get from this to this and what does it say about our past and our world today, or we're gonna find out in this wisecrack addition on the cinematic history of villainy and warning.

Speaker 1:          00:59          There's a ton of spoilers here for movies, both old and new, but before we do that, want to give a quick shout out to our sponsor over at Wix, whether you're a hero, a villain, or a guy who makes philosophy videos on youtube, everyone needs a website and which gives you the tools to make one that doesn't look like Comic Sans and Papayas had a baby, wakes has the solutions for all your Creator needs, from launching an online store to embedding videos of yourself, eating donuts, whatever your dream is, weeks keeps your site secure and your design possibilities infinite so you can build out a website that's actually what you want pretty fast.

To understand how we got here, we have to explore multiple arrows and see how film villains embody the spirit and anxieties of the times.

Speaker 1:          01:49          Now, a quick disclaimer, none of these trends are absolute villains, can break the mold or jump back into the past for inspiration, but what we're discussing here are noticeable trends among some of the most enduring films of each era. We're going to start our journey from these simple mustache twirling villain to the complex philosophizing radical by looking at the 19 fifties and early 19 sixties, the height of the war that wasn't hot in the post World War party in the suburbs era of American history describing our world seemed pretty simple. We were the heroes who saved the world from the evil Nazis, and we're now tasked with staving off the also evil Ussr. It was very black and white, and so where are villains? Well, yeah, literally, but also metaphorically movie screens were full of bad Russian people, bad Asian people, and very bad aliens. What do all these naughty dudes have in common? They're the other inherent, inexplicably evil that stoked on destroying America and our apple pie values sometimes that other took the form of an amorphous read for Kami blob or the creature from the black lagoon. Other times the other was an alien hatched in a pod and designed to look exactly like you as in the invasion of the body snatchers, which some critics say represented the fear of communist brainwashing and infiltration,

Speaker 2:          03:06          and you're reborn into an untroubled exactly what a world.

Speaker 1:          03:15          Also in the fifties, the movie industry went way back to basics British thing, a number of biblical Sagas with running times of four hours or more of these expensive epics proved massively popular with three ranking in the top 10 highest grossing films of the decade. Perhaps this was partially because they so perfectly embodied cold war propaganda which depicted a face off between God fearing Americans and the godless communist Ben Hur showed an aristocratic Jews being persecuted by an Evil Roman commander while quo Vadis pits. New Christian converts against the Evil Emperor Nero and his Roman Empire. A world is mine and mine, and the 10 commandments depicts good old Moses staring down the Egyptian Emperor Ramses. These films all portrayed the Noble Judeo Christian taking on a cruel, powerful, desperate of a non monotheistic religion. These villains were representative of larger groups of bad people who want it to cancel baseball. Tupperware parties,

Speaker 3:          04:12          rain is not only been washed as they say, just being dry, clean,

Speaker 1:          04:19          even when villains weren't explicitly foreign or pagan. They were just anti American communists, double agents as seen in a flurry of cold war propaganda films later spy mania of the 19 sixties would also reflect cold war anxiety with James Bond facing off against various agents have smashed the imaginary Russian intelligence agency not to remain that much longer. What all these movies had in common was an US versus them mentality with no good commies portrayed as pure and simply evil. One dimensional foreign slash communist slash alien slash blog villains took a backseat in the late sixties and seventies as we saw a definitive shift in the portrayal of villains. It was fitting for a time of major social turbulence and soul searching. As the civil rights movement and Vietnam made visible, some of the not so perfect aspects of America like racism and war, this period also saw a startling drop in public trust of government, a phenomenon that changed movie villains dramatically as outrage over the war met outrage about Nixon's tapes.

Speaker 1:          05:22          Notably 19 seventies movies shined a light on the corrupt social systems that Americans were increasingly disillusioned with. Evil politicians and public officials loomed large popular political thriller. All the president's men brought the Watergate scandal to the big screen in 1976. Fictional accounts also touched on institutional corruption like in Steven Spielberg's jaws, which depicts a crooked mayor who cares more about tourism revenue then keeping people from becoming shark bait. For Christ's sake, Kumar's the fourth of July at we will be open for business. It's going to be one of the best summers we've ever had. Further depictions, the evil in mighty came in Chinatown in which these sinister billionaire rejects audiences judgments of him by claiming that his evil acts were brought about by his environment.

Speaker 2:          06:06          People never have to face the fact the right time, the right place, they're capable of anything.

Speaker 1:          06:14          The suggestion is that circumstances have power make the villain rather than any innate nature. Corrupt cop films where another popular way of portraying the power struggles taking place serpico based on a true story, depicts a world in which police corruption is an assumed fact.

Speaker 4:          06:30          You're fine, you're fine without a warning, right in your head.

Speaker 1:          06:35          In this world, bribes and brutality are the coffee and donuts of police work, so much so that Alba, Chino Serpico, is distrusted because he's not willing to accept bribes. Let's face it, who can dress the cabin? We don't take money. Corrupt cops were mainstays on the big screen popping up in the Godfather, white lightening, the French connection and the conversation to name a few institutions, it seems had lost their presumption of goodwill, and as a result, we started seeing villains who embodied the very broken systems. People were angry about take nurse ratchet from one flew over the cuckoo's nest who turned a benevolent profession into one that turns a vivid individuals into drugged up dependent ghosts of themselves.

Speaker 4:          07:13          You're no crazier in the average ass flat walking around on the streets and that's it.

Speaker 1:          07:18          In a similarly bleak depiction of institutionalization. Escape from Alcatraz renders prisoners sympathetic heroes struggling against the efforts of an evil warden. Something very similar can be seen in cool hand luke. In all these cases, the person tasked with imposing law and order or societal norms is recast as the villain. The 19 seventies further muddied the waters by blurring the line between hero and villain and told the distinctions became all but meaningless. These characters are depicted as conflicted, heavily flawed protagonists with questionable even hideous morals in Martin Scorsese's. Nineteen 76 film taxi driver, Travis bickle is one such heroic villain or villain is hero depending on your perspective. He swings on the pendulum of violently bad to violently good ish as it goes from plotting to gun down a presidential candidate, the plotting to rescue a 12 year old prostitute in the previous years. Dog Day, afternoon, novice crook and hero slash villain Sunny Warcek botches, a bank robbery and spontaneously takes all the workers hostage.

Speaker 1:          08:19          However, we soon learned the reason for sunny's dalliance with crime. He needed the money to help his wife, Leon get sexual reassignment surgery right away. Sonny wanted to get me money for the sex change operation, but when is he going to get it? We find out that sunny is a quality dude who pays his parents rent and doesn't typically go around holding up banks, not your villain of the past. Meanwhile, one particularly popular series. Star wars stands out as markedly simplistic in this era of more complex villains. It might seem to counter our theory as it presents a pretty basic black and white paradigm of good versus evil, even if it goes against the grain later on with he walks reminiscent of the Viet Cong. The 19 eighties backpedaled hard on the anti villain by reveling in more cartoonish villains who directly embodied the biggest threats of time effectively, it ushered back in an US versus them paradigm by tapping into the fear surrounding the war on drugs.

Speaker 1:          09:14          Unsurprisingly, the villains of the time wanted a piece of that sweet, sweet drug money in films like scarface to live and die in La. Beverly Hills cop and raw deal, this depiction of evil drug lords could be seen as a Yin Yang response to the less than savory cops of the seventies. Films Take Tango and cash, which depicted to roguish cops who are treated as irrepressible protagonists despite engaging in some of the exact same violence, serpico condemned, however they're portrayed as the best cops in the city because they're unconventional. Tactics have costs. Local drug lord and rat kissing villain Eve's Perrey oodles of money then said kingpin, as if schooled in the bad cup films of the seventies gets them falsely incriminated for murder. The film ultimately comes down hard on the side of cops and a by any means necessary model of policing. I've been a policeman for 12 years and I think it's the best organization in the country.

Speaker 1:          10:08          At the same time, the decade saw the resurgence of cold war anxieties as president Ronald Reagan increased military spending and ended arms control. Americans rediscovered their fear of nuclear war. At the same time, evil Russians had their moment in the sun with films like rocky, for which remain the highest grossing sports flick until 2009. It's also been accused of being pure anti Soviet propaganda because of its villain Soviet boxer, Ivan Drago, who was decidedly not a charmer, the film red heat, really one the villain jackpot in its depiction of Soviet drug lord Victor Rostow, who in a Trifecta of evil also murdered the protagonist partner, but arguably the clearest example of 19 of these cold war villains came with 1984 is red dawn, which imagine Soviet forces invading America and worse, taking photos in our national parks. The film's director, John Milius, explicitly saw the film as a warning to Americans to take seriously the threat of the Soviet invasion by a Central America.

Speaker 1:          11:05          And if this seems like a scaremonger for you, consider that Melius was the direct inspiration for this guy multimode front, you're entering a world of pain despite some return to the other as the enemy. There are hints of the seventies skepticism towards institutions in the 19 eighties when villains are not pure character traits. From an Ansi Reagan fever dream, we see them continue exploiting corrupt institutions for personal gain. Gordon greed is good. Gecko, for instance, uses the corrupt financial industry to fulfill his own gold plated desires. Meanwhile, diehards, Hans Gruber, emerges as one for decades. Most enduring villains, when he and his cronies sees a high rise building and take hostages during a Christmas party, operates under the guise of being a terrorist, exacting revenge on an Evil Corporation director. The Naca trauma corporations legacy

Speaker 5:          11:53          agreed around the globe. They are about to be taught a lesson in the real useful,

Speaker 1:          11:59          but interestingly enough, his moral high ground crumbled when it's revealed that just like Gordon Gekko, he's really only after cold hard cash. This is all about the robbery.

Speaker 5:          12:14          The whole building odds are under $600. You can just disappear when you still $600 million. They will find you unless you're already dead.

Speaker 1:          12:24          In the nineties, American cinema swapped out the reds for homegrown terrorists to fit a decade in which domestic terrorism and going postal dominated headlines Fittingly in cinema. It was an era of disgruntled Middleclass dudes and bombers next door, a prime time for complex anti villains who are fighting small localized battles by radical means, take the villain from speed. Howard Payne, this former bomb squad officer turned extortionist, turned psychopathic. Terrorists is partially motivated by that suite. Three point $7,000,000, but he also expresses a sense of superiority.

Speaker 2:          12:58          You still don't get it, dad, Jack, a bomb was made to explode. That's its meaning, its purpose.

Speaker 1:          13:08          That's bananas, but it's a hint of philosophy, a motivation beyond cold, hard cash. Howard's more complicated than say gruber, in that he genuinely desires meaning and purpose. It just goes about getting them in the worst way possible. Same goes for Kevin Spacey, supremely sadistic John Doe in the 1995 films, seven who sees himself as a chosen warrior in the crusade against everyday. Since

Speaker 6:          13:32          we see a deadly sin on every street corner in every home and we tolerate it, we tolerate it because it's common sense. It's trivial. We tolerate it. Morning, noon, and night. Well, not anymore. I'm setting the example.

Speaker 1:          13:49          By the end of the decade, Arlington Road became the pinnacle of the domestic terrorists genre, who's villain mans the girl at the block party as he carries out plans for his militant groups, latest deadly bombing.

Speaker 2:          14:00          I'm a mess. There's millions of waiting to take up arms ready to spread the word.

Speaker 1:          14:06          He claims to be pursuing a lofty noble goal, but within his critique of government is also an indictment of the supposed niceties of Clinton era prosperity.

Speaker 2:          14:15          Are you happy in your godless

Speaker 1:          14:19          trouble in suburbia? Also bounded in American beauty which depicted the enemy as lester's neighbor be homophobic. Nazi memorabilia. Hoarding Frank Fits who kills Lester after he rebuffs his romantic advancements. In both cases, the villains feel victimized by the system or circumstance and seek justice on their own terms. Sometimes these villains have genuinely noble causes as they rail against the systems that have long take. Nineteen 95. The Rock in which Ed Harris has general humble, a disgraced USFC. SMC Brigadier General threatens a nerve gas attack on San Francisco. 15 vx gas rockets into the hardest San Francisco. You've got 17 hours to deliver the money, demanding that the families have slain marines be compensated for their deaths. Here we come to an interesting question of whether noble ends justified by what means in this way, the film acts as a prelude to the questions being explored by current day villains, though usually on a much wider scale, movies couldn't not be changed by an event as pivotal as nine slash 11 and the subsequent war on terror with the two thousands came a new shift in movie villains, as America confronted an existential threat to its sense of safety and power in the world.

Speaker 1:          15:27          Fittingly the first two installments of Christopher Nolan's dark knight trilogy captured the Popular Imagination. In this decade. In 2005 Batman begins, we see the dangerous metropolis under attack by an international terrorist group called the League of shadows and its leader rouse. Oh, cool. Who in remarkably on the nose metaphor, wants to blow up Gotham's tallest skyscraper. Arguably the decades most salient villain came, of course, with Heath Ledger's portrayal of the joker in the dark knight. The joker manifests as the spirit of terrorism, the embodiment of anarchy and chaos of a particularly destructive and nihilistic nature. As critic Douglas Kellner writes in his book, Cinema Wars, the only sensible way to live in this world is without rules in case the comparison between the joker and real world terrorism wasn't clear enough. Calendar notes that the film is bursting with nine slash 11 iconography. Nolan's film also gave us one of two coin flipping evildoers with the character of Harvey Dent alias to face, a representation of how a confrontation with the joker's evils can corrupt even the noblest person to face goes about deciding people's fates, do a plunge into a completely meaningless existence of pure contingency and nihilism.

Speaker 1:          16:35          Meanwhile, the Coen brothers, Anton sugar from no country for old men also uses a coin to decide the fate of his victims. He doesn't kill out of greed self or some kind of practical goal. Leading one character to comment is a peculiar man might even say he has principles transcend money or drugs or anything like that. Indeed, sugar is quite simply an active nihilists who believes that if all morality is contrived, a coin flip is as good a way as any to decide who lives and dies, but you don't need a coin to affirm the random or meaningless nature of our lives are deaths. Take Martin Scorsese's 2006, film the departed, which featured Jack Nicholson as chief gangster Frank Costello from merciless killing. She felt funny to his refusal to subscribe to any rules. I don't want to be a product of my environment. I want my environment to be a product of me.

Speaker 1:          17:31          Frank's action seems shaped by the belief that life is meaningless as you will act accordingly. Frank, who we later find out was an FBI informant sees life as one long struggle during which any actions that sustain you for just one more day are entirely excusable. Of course, plenty of other villain archetypes punctuated the two thousands, but if the two thousands where a time when the villain is creed was no credit at all. We've come a long way since then. Today are villains are the product of an increasingly divided America bracing itself for impact with trust in government, media, and religious faith at all time. Lows, villains reflect America's innate skepticism towards systems. Any systems, all the systems villain simply embody solutions that are way too radical and usually mind bogglingly violent, the polar opposite of a 19 fifties villain who represented an evildoer infiltrating and inherently good system in hopes of corrupting it. Today's villains increasingly face objectively evil systems which they want to change for the better. The only thing that makes these characters villains rather than starry eyed heroes is their means of carrying out that change.

Speaker 7:          18:41          You agree to end the war on drugs once and for all. My colleagues and I received full legal immunity.

Speaker 1:          18:48          The classic caveat of, Hey man, you'd be really cool if we weren't trying to kill half the world. For instance, Black Panthers killmonger played by Michael B. Jordan has an entirely legitimate critique of how the world treats its black citizens and will conduct past severity as they suffer. In fact, killmonger would argue that the real villains of the film are Wakandans who sit on a stockpile of vibranium while pretending to be a helpless third world country. We're killmonger is perspective gets debatably. Tricky is in the means. He wants to ship bill condon weapons all over the world and instigate a militant uprising. The world's going to start over, and this time we're on top. The Sun will never set on the will. Conduct empire, though to Cholla defeats him and stops the scheme. He does go to the UN to admit Wakanda's real capacities and even establishes a candy and outreach center in Oakland suggesting an end to Wakanda is isolationism.

Speaker 1:          19:38          So killmonger is radicalism, actually brought about a less radical but positive change in policy. Then there's mission impossible. Six is new utilitarian villain, August walker slash jog Lark, who wants to destroy a third of the world in the hopes that the other two thirds would come together in the wake of the attacks, or as he says, there's never been peace without first the great suffering or the suffering that created the piece or if it any worse than those who wants to kill half of everyone to solve resource scarcities that play for universe or incredibles, two's bill and screen slaver. We use uses hypnotic screens to mind, control her minions or personal beef with the system that the endless repackaging of life into consumable media has made us all lazy. Passive observers and that superheroes are an integral part of the equation, keeping us docile and meet her plan to change the system.

Speaker 1:          20:26          Mind control superheroes and ruined their public approval rating so people will learn that they have to protect themselves. What all these villains share is a majorly out their plan that appeals to our country's growing fears. That the world is screwed beyond repair and the only way to fix it is to tear it all down. In this brave new world of villainy, we're able to, with the villains critique of the system and their desire to change it. In this through the looking glass reinterpretation of Villainy, the heroes are almost inevitably cast as slightly flawed protectors of the status quo that no one's really happy with. In the grand scheme of things, contemporary villains seemed to be a weird mirror image of fifties villains who want to corrupt good institutions. Whereas killmonger types want to effect good change in corrupt institutions. They just go about it in very bad ways.

Speaker 1:          21:14          At the same time, our contemporary villain seemed to have merged the complexity and sometimes apparent innocence of nineties villains while broadening the social critiques of the seventies and standing in opposition to the nihilism of the two thousands. They do believe that there's a cause worth fighting for, and if they drafted different blueprints for creating social change, they might just resurface as complex heroes.
