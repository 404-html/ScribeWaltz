Speaker 1:          00:03          Well, you have to do it, you have to, you can't just be off for six months and then step on a stage and expect to be sort of incomplete possession of your vocal powers. So it's a muscle like anything else and you have to practice and you have to, uh, just do it. And that's what keeps you, I think going strong. I can tell you a terrible story. Well, not a terrible story, but a true story. It's dreadful when you think about it though. It was back in the early nineties, I was touring in Australia with Lucinda Williams and Rosanne cash and we were doing these songwriter nights all around Australia and uh, every night we and we often share the same big dressing room or whatever. And every night Roseanne and Lucinda would warm up vocally. And I, I hadn't quite gotten to that place where I realized that how important that was, you know, and Roseanne would be in her corner, a singing scales and doing that sort of thing. And Lucinda had some method in her corner, just, I think she would sort of almost bend over and try to breathe up and stuff and people would sort of wonder what I would do and I'd sit in my corner smoking cigarettes. That's terrible. Don't smoke anymore. I quit that a long time ago. But that's, that's how naive I was about how important it is to take care of your boys.

Speaker 1:          01:40          I know that a lot of. I know a lot of artists who smoke say that and swear by it. Um, and uh, but for me, no, I had to, I had to quit a long time ago.
