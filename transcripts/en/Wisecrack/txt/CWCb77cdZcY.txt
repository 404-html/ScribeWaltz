Speaker 1:          00:03          What's up guys. Jared here and today we're talking about one of the best anime of the year, season two of my hero academia, my hero academia. Ask some serious questions about heroism, namely our all of our heroes full of woken list. Wisecrack quick take on my hero academia season two and of course spoilers ahead for those uninitiated. Here's a quick recap. Mindoro academia takes place in a world war 80% of people manifest some sort of superpower or quirk and being a hero has finally become a full time job.

Speaker 2:          00:34          Canela cut staff in [inaudible] 89 can you kind of assume road

Speaker 1:          00:39          and eight glamorous one at that middle school or mid Doria is Zuku yearns to be like his idol. Be Hero. All Mike but unfortunately is cordless. But after demonstrating his selflessness to all might madorie heir receives his very own powers from his hero.

Speaker 2:          00:54          Done a show with me. She mean you seemed you to walk us snow. We got it. Good at the dock, kimmy. No, been through your uncle too.

Speaker 1:          01:14          After a year of training, memoria enrolls in the exclusive high school for will be heroes UAA academy. At the end of season one, he and his classmates come face to face with some real bad guys. The League of villains led by sugar, Rocky Tamara only for all might to save the day. Now, there are a lot of great moments in season two, but where this question of what it means to be a hero really comes to the fore is during the stain art class, President Eda 10 ya'll learns that his brother has been attacked by the hero killer stain stain. Believe that today's heroes are more concerned with their own image than actually doing good. [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          02:00          determined to get revenge eda then interns with the less than prestigious normal hero in order to find stain. Wild Memoria Doria is stuck well with this guy and as sugar rocky on leashes, a hoard of biologically engineered super villains on the city. Eda memoria and fellow classmate Tota Roci managed to converge on stain and capture him. The stain arch raises the question what causes our obsession with heroism? According to philosopher Ernest Becker, the desire to be a hero is innate. It's the desire to be the very best at something and ultimately to be remembered and thereby transcend death. But most of us aren't. Heroes were Jerry's or some mentos at best. Instead, Becker tells us that we redirect this desire into society or what he calls cultural hero systems. Bummed. You're not all might. That's okay. Feel special because in genomes, younger brother interns at your hero agency sad. You're not always saving the day. Who Cares? You can still feature on a TV talk show panel because of your ridiculous costume. It's this kind of hero worship which stain opposes instead of believing that Hiro's must epitomize self sacrifice.

Speaker 3:          03:06          [inaudible] you doing [inaudible] sold off all [inaudible] here you she don't even know. Hygiene, sugar, bodily organ music. She's a good mother.

Speaker 1:          03:22          Same rejects a society that treats heroes like celebrities paying them for capturing villains and allowing them to use their status for lucrative side hustles. Same believes that being a superhero with an asterisk isn't being a superhero at all. And this argument isn't all that crazy. And in fact, mirrors and idea that philosopher slash senior men's models, Jacques Derrida dubbed unconditional hospitality. To Derrida. Unconditional hospitality is a pure, unbounded kindness and generosity to others. A law without law, as he confusingly called it to dairy dot. True absolute hospitality cannot be imposed upon by rules, duties, or laws, whether they be legal, cultural, or even moral. Otherwise it stops being unconditional. As one thinker put it, the law of hospitality is absolute in that it requires one to give all one has to another without asking any questions and posing any restrictions or requiring any compensation. If we apply Derrida's logic to my hair academia, the heroes are only acting out a conditional hospitality. How you look over your care team may accuse you of doing the bowl game though he acts Sonia Super. So I'll say [inaudible]. You hope this is particularly the case with Eda who is so wrapped up in his desire for revenge that he forgets what it means to be a hero. Putting others first. And Dakota Hito [inaudible] will know to know Tom, any wholesale when eat a stumbles upon stain attacking native eva, is it really coming to the rescue instead, he's implicitly making natives rescue contingent on him getting what he wants, killing stain and saying the perceptive slasher tells it as it is. Does Dad oh you to a muzzle Tuscan.

Speaker 3:          05:28          Here's the Kodo clady meets a toast credo. Say [inaudible] she cuddles [inaudible] feudal kind of tumor.

Speaker 1:          05:42          By the way, this white team was really awesome. Probably one of the best of the season and if you want to see it broken down by one of our friends, check out jeff over at mother's basement. He just dropped a video analyzing all the things that make this fight scene incredible. So check them out in the link in the description. You won't regret it. Anyway, this all goes to show what makes medallia and all mites special. They're unwavering adherence to unconditional hospitality. In fact, it's Madorie as willingness to sacrifice himself for others, even without a quirk that originally drew all might the him,

Speaker 2:          06:17          you.

Speaker 1:          06:28          And over the course of seasons one and two, we see memorial putting himself on the line over and over again, whether it's leaping into the fray against the League of villains, when all my team's down for the count or arriving last minute to save Edo Stain. Hell Madora can even use one for all without essentially shattering the bones in his body, but that's never stopped him. Of course, stain recognizes this trait. Memoria initially sparing him [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible], but [inaudible] is only a pale comparison of what stain really wants to fight the symbol of peace himself. After stain saves Memoria from being abducted, he declares Jamie,

Speaker 4:          07:09          no, no, no, no shale.

Speaker 1:          07:20          That's right. Staying motivated to make a more just society will only let himself be brought down by eight true hero. The embodiment of unconditional hospitality all might. Now stain isn't the main villain of my hero academia, but his impact has really felt in the seasons. Concluding episode, what starts as a day off from a Dorianne, his classmates ends with Memoria being briefly held captive by sugar rocky. Now sugar rocky is royally pissed at stain for scorning him and drawing so much attention.

Speaker 2:          07:48          Martin Davis, so good [inaudible].

Speaker 1:          07:53          What sugar, rocky can't see is how he's different than stain, but asthma. Doria explains staying stands for something.

Speaker 2:          08:00          Costa Rica cost is on tonight. I know he does it on him though it does go to the mall. He Sony, Datto.

Speaker 1:          08:13          Now to end this, we're going to invoke a little more becker here. Remember those cultural hero systems in society? He said they were all based on the denial of death. The reason why we strive to get a raise, fall in love or even start a family is because even if we're only side characters and then pcs were desperately trying to feel special in our little corner of the universe and be remembered to becker though society would crumble if we ever realized how little our deaths actually mean to the unfeeling universe. As such, we have to desperately protect these fragile artificial hero systems that make up society. This issue of confronting death becomes even more pronounced in the world of my hero academia where your everyday citizens mortality constantly put on display when supervillains can appear and kill hundreds in an instant. How does your average person go about living their life? Just as in our lives, people can only create meaning by building up images of heroes and for shipping and specifically the symbol of peace himself. All might as shooter rocky releases Madorie. Yet he realizes he's been driven by an ideal all along. Destroying the symbol that gives society eats

Speaker 5:          09:20          quite sort of [inaudible]. [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible].

Speaker 1:          09:35          So what do you think? Wise cracking, what does it mean to be a hero or they really the glue that binds society together?
