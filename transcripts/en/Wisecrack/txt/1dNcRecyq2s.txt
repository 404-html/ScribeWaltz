Speaker 1:          00:10          Of course it will depend on which cities were talking about. Um, I think that we will see variations between different parts of the world and different parts of the United States. I would, my prognosis is that the biggest game changer in the future of cities by 2050 will be the technology at the moment, which is rapidly erupting in connectivity. Um, you know, and often it often occurs to me that a lot of the travel that we do in our current environment is not travel that we really want to do. It's because we work somewhere distant from where we live. And I would like to think that in the cities in 2050 generally, each area of a, a large city, it will become more community based. So there'll be a lot more options for people not to have to move around in the first place. So rather than commute 20 or 30 miles across a big city will have the opportunity to do a lot of our work. Maybe not all of it, but a lot of our work quite close to where we live, uh, that we need to get away from the idea that we live in large dormitory areas. And then we have all of our work in industry and a office space and another area. There are plenty of good examples of how you can mix a mixed the zones up and still make a very livable and enjoyable environment for people to live in. So rather than a commute being a couple of hours out of every day, uh, maybe a commute means just a couple of minutes.

Speaker 1:          01:59          Ooh, that's more difficult to, that's more difficult to say. I think if the human race is still around in a hundred years, uh, it means that we have, we've been hung very much over the edge of the cliff and we have, we'll have got good at a lot of things. I think, uh, I think even maybe by 20, 50, uh, I mentioned it a little before, we will probably be moving goods a lot less and food we will be needing to grow a lot of the food and the goods that we consume. Uh, we need to produce that much more locally to where we live rather than divorcing it from the cities need to become more integrated. And the same with work. Uh, I think that would be far more community based. In some ways it will require us to, to go backwards a little. Maybe it will be living in smaller, but at the same time, much more desirable living spaces. Uh, we will, I mean, it's just, it's so difficult to predict what technologies will have available. And I'm in 90 years time, it's difficult enough in 50 years time, but so it's really difficult to say. So if we've got cities and 2100, uh, makes me very optimistic that we'll be still around, we'll be, if we're still around, it means we figured out how to do a lot of things much better than we're doing now. Yeah.
