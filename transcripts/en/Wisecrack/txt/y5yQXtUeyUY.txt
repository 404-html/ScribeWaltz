Speaker 1:          00:20          Greetings and welcome to earthlings cinema. I am your host Garrick's wormy Lloyd. This week's artifact is team America world police from South Park creators, Oliver Stone and Matt Parker, who were famously exiled from Earth after literally pissing off everyone, the film opens in France where some kindly terrorists chaperone a beeping briefcase that is until the US Olympic team choppers in. They win the interpretive dance round, but take home the silver in not dying over on broad street and actor named Gary Sings about one of Earth's best diseases. Everyone has a attracting the attention of agent Colson. I mean Morpheus, I mean a balding horny puppet. He takes him to Rushmore Academy where he asks him to do the plot of 21 jump street, but with terrorists. Although considering how teens were in those days, there wasn't much of a difference in Korea town, a near site, a dictator has the terrorists over for Kimchi. Giving them some bombs as party favors, gary gets his eyebrows done at the spa so he can infiltrate the Cantina Bar, but soon team America shows up and sweeps the gold medal and destroying a native culture. America's oldest past time, the team gets drunk. All friendship and Lisa and Gary do the bippity Boppity Boo.

Speaker 1:          01:38          Gary's not the only one getting blown. Jack donaghy fears the Olympics or stealing Liz lemon's ratings and partners with k town for a piece ceremony where Kim will secretly detonated bombs. Oh No, no air quotes on that one. Remembering that it's the end of act two. Gary quits and gets mild.

Speaker 2:          02:01          The

Speaker 1:          02:02          Fat Guy, suicide squad's HQ just as Kim blows the team's cover and captures them, but their covers not the only thing getting blown. That's a call back just for you. Gary trains with Spotswood, trainspotting, if you will, and they go to k town to get the band back together. They kill most of the film actors guild and no intelligent life is lost with the stage. Empty Gary attention. Whores it up and engages in the time. Honored tradition of oratory. The only thing that can be an asshole is it Dick donaghy gets ousted from NBC and Kim falls on an outright baseball cap revealing his true form a horse team America world police can be viewed as a response to the surge of nationalism. The USA experienced after nine slash 11, considered by many to be just never forgettable. The film is a satire stylized after massive Hollywood blockbusters and Netflix's which commonly celebrated American power and perseverance. The film beats down cliche after cliche like they owe it money. It mocks the emotional levers these films try to pull just as it makes fun of the overly sentimental country ballots that make war seemed great.

Speaker 1:          03:26          The big bangs and puppet bans lies a more subtle exploration of America's role in the world. Some scholars support the hegemonic stability theory, which supposes that the world will be better off with a superpower calling the shots. Team America believes in American exceptionalism. The idea that the United States was better than all other seven countries and therefore duty bound to shape the world too. It's obese standards. Don't you understand? Every country in the world is in danger. How is it my responsibility to do something because like it or not, you're the one with the power to do something. The film pokes fun at this attitude by showing various ways that Americans are poorly suited to boss baby. Every one around. When the film identifies a foreign location, it notes the distance from the USA, exemplifying the tendency Americans had to look down on other countries as well as the metric system. Cities such as Paris and tattooing are reduced to their most famous landmarks which are portrayed incorrectly as being right next to each other instead of on top of each other. Foreign languages are portrayed as Jibberish, although it's all human. To me, this ignorance and lack of respect for other countries manifests as team America demolishes world landmarks to make room for a whole food.

Speaker 2:          04:43          Ironically,

Speaker 1:          04:44          the self centered attitude is similar to the terrorist psychology according to smoking hot, Lisa, usually a case of malignant narcissism you brought on during childhood. Damn, you're tearing me apart, Lisa. The film asks whether this careless destructiveness and the name of American ideals is any better than the terrorists intentional attacks because it's the thought that counts, but the film is far from a one sided hit piece on American jingoism unchained. It criticizes ignorance on the other side of the aisle to the actors standing in for Alcoholic Grad students, or liberals think they're better than team America. The film actors guild believes that what the world needs is compassion, not violence. All the team America does is create new enemies, but their position is based on the same blinding Elitism as team Americas. What the world needs is an international advisory committee who truly understands global politics, namely us and their ignorance, causes them to bumble their way into the wrong side of a global crisis. Ultimately, the film concludes that despite the occasional terrorist attack, someone's got to deal with purely destructive entities, especially if those entities can sing. So really in the end, the film endorses a more cautious America, but in America, yeah. Nonetheless, it was the state motto of Florida after all, before it flooded, and the sharks ate everybody until they were dead.
