Speaker 1:          00:00          This video is sponsored by movement, watches in sunglasses, more on movement at the end of this video. Hey, wise crack, jared here, we all just saw thor ragnarok and surprise. We have some thoughts. Not only is it quite possibly the funniest smart movie, it's also very close to being the smartest. Like most marvel clicks, there's a metric buttload of smashy fight, fight, punctuated by smug. Self awareness is a friend from work, but underneath the ocean of jokes, fights and uncredited Matt Damon Cameos. There are a few scenes that speak to really interesting ideas, but before we dive in any further, here's your obligatory spoiler warning. One of the most enduring images of the movie is thor missing, and I just like his father odin and we couldn't help but ponder. If in norse mythology, odin loses his eye to see a greater knowledge. What truth does thor see when he loses his eye?

Speaker 1:          00:56          So let's see why marvel took thor's. I in this quick take on Thor Ragnarok. First, a quick recap for returns to as garden from a spirit quest complete with the crown of a fire. Giant only defined Loki in charge disguised as Odin. They go to find the real odin who promptly dies immediately after big sister Hela Goddess of death comes back from her banishment to hot topic to claim the as guardian thrown and expand the empire. So she destroys thor's hammer and sends thor and Loki tumbling in the space. Thor ends up being a gladiator on a planet called Secar. Loki weasels himself into Jeff Gold boons aristocracy. And with the help of new friends like Valkyrie and his colleague, the incredible hulk, thor gets back to asgard by Tele and saves his people. What a ride. So sure. Door fights the hulk again. Jeff Goldwin plays a space.

Speaker 1:          01:44          Cj and Loki gets rescued by Acuvi rock monster. But what's more interesting is rackner entrepreneur occupation with the past and how it forms the world we live in. This is most clearly seen during hellos reign over as guard. When hello arrives, She sees a fresco depicting as guards history as all peace treaties and celebrations. But that's not how she remembers it to her as guards. History is all blood and conquest and feeding enemies. Tour giant Wolf. She wrecks the fresco revealing one hidden beneath one that depicts the history. Odin tried to sweep under the rug. He anhelica conquering, killing, and generally wreaking havoc. She destroys what appears to be the entire as guardian army on her own. Then brings her old army's back to life and suddenly as guard is just like when she left it, a military dictatorship run by a power hungry deity.

Speaker 1:          02:35          What's really clever here is that just as hello wants to reach into the dark and bring the past back to life, so to do all our central characters need to reconcile with their past in order to make any progress. This is the substance buried under all the comedy in this movie. It's interested in how we deal with our past. For the whole, this is simple. Banner has been stuck in hoke mode for two years. It's not until he witnesses his past by seeing a video of black widow that he's forced to confront what he left behind when he flew into outer space, allowing banner to emerge and the escape to truly start. Valkyrie used to be a member of an elite, all female as guardians, strikeforce, but ages ago when Hella killed everyone but her and a huge battle she gave up that life and became a scavenger.

Speaker 1:          03:22          It's only when she confronts those memories that she can return to the heroism she left behind. Lokeys confrontation with the past comes through his connection to his brother. Loki has always wanted thor to recognize him either with love or fear, but toward the end of the movie, Dor indicates that he no longer cares about Loki. It takes until the last 20 minutes of the movie, but Loki finally realizes that to start his own future, he has to grow out of the person he was in the past. Despite his self aggrandizing battle cry of your savior is here. We see real growth in his decision not to steal the tesseract and in the fact that after the fight he sticks around instead of running away. But what about thor? Well, that's the biggest issue with this idea of history and what keeps the film from being decisively Marvel's smartest movie.

Speaker 1:          04:09          We never get to see thor dealing with his own history, nor with as guards. The closest we get to this is his battle with hello, which could be considered as a metaphorical conflict between as God's future and it's past. This is the concept of the heart of full ragnar rock. In order to move into the future, people and societies need to reckon with their past and idea that is very present throughout human history. It starts with the way that society's tell stories to themselves about themselves for a long time, as God presented itself as a warlike culture. When Odin one of the shift toward a more peaceful arrangement, he rewrote the history of as guard to exclude Hela and all the fighting and position himself as a benevolent protector. You've probably heard the phrase that history is written by the winners, but according to scholars like Michelle from co and Jenny Ed Kins history is written for the winners, but what that means is that history is written to justify past violence and set the stage for whatever needs to happen in the future.

Speaker 1:          05:05          Atkins explains this process by describing the end of a war. Victory Parades, remembrance ceremonies and war museums tell of glory, courage and sacrifice. The Nation is renewed. The state strengthened with the commemoration of the past. We justify the measures taken to reach the future. That means the story of the past dictates the future. We see this idea played with at the beginning when lokeys disguises Odin, he's putting on a play recontextualizing his deception as sacrifice and rewriting the history of as guard with himself as a hero, all wild munching on fresh grapes. The as guard around him is centered on indulgence and celebration and Loki crafts its history to justify that behavior. He's not the only one to pull this trick and he's certainly not the most dangerous for Hela as guards. History is inextricably tied to this idea of place. She believes that expanding the territory of as guard is the same as making as guard.

Speaker 1:          05:59          More powerful. This equation of a people to a place has a long role in human history. Theorist David Campbell explains the dangers of time, political identity, and security to a single place. One of his ideas is essentially that when a population and its power is tied to a place that makes everyone outside of that place and enemy and a potential threat and in a world full of potential threats, safety is an illusion and that means hell is wars would wage forever. It takes a visit from ghost dad for thor to understand that the people of Asgard matter more than the place or even the name. This is the epiphany that lead owed into casting hell out her militarism based on defending the land of as guard from threats or expanding its power would be the ruin of the people of Asgard. This is why thor loses his eye in norse mythology.

Speaker 1:          06:50          Odin trades his iphone knowledge. Similarly, thor loses his eye in the moment when he finally sees the truth that what really matters isn't territory. It's the people who create the culture. In the end, Loki unleashes the fire giant who destroys as guard and hello whippet by destroying the territory and making the as guardians, nomadic space travelers. They now have a chance to create their own history unbound from the past despite the pain it brings underneath a secar sized pile of space, junk, special effects and fantastic jokes. Ragnarok is a movie about how we understand national social and personal identity in the context of our past, whether for better or worse those paths and form our futures and only by confronting them directly can we ever really move on. Hope you guys enjoyed the movie. Thanks for watching peace.
