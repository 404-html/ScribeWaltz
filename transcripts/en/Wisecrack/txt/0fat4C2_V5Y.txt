Speaker 1:          00:10          Yeah, so I was reviewing a book by a guy named Mark Mcdonald who teaches at Ucla and um, which I think is a terrific book called the program era. And the argument of the book is that American fiction since 1945, 1950, has been highly influenced by the fact that so many novelists and so many people who teach novelists have gone through writing programs, um, and it's not a take down in any way. His book, his book basically says that writing programs provide a certain environment where a particular kind of fiction gets produced and these kinds of fiction are very interesting. They're often very experimental. They take fiction of directions that otherwise it wouldn't go. It doesn't mean that everything's being dumbed down or cookie cuttered. Um, and I thought that was very provocative and he gave some pretty good readings of contemporary fiction to back up his claim about it.

Speaker 1:          01:00          So I would tend to agree with him. I mean, it's, it is different. It's a fact of life since 1950 or so, that wasn't true before that, um, writers had different ways of organizing themselves and different sort of social groupings in which to perform their work. But the fact that many of them go through the university now, it does effect what they write but doesn't mean they write it. What they're writing is an interesting. I've, as I said in that piece, I myself was a creative writing major in college and I look back on those experiences with great fondness and I think they were very good for me too. So I think it's a totally appropriate thing to have inside the academy. I wish I could say it made it better, but um, it certainly gave me lots of models to bounce off of and learn from. And then part of it is just that I wrote poetry and you know, not that many people are into contemporary poetry, but if you can hang out with the people who are in your college, it's really a wonderful thing to share. Um, and I really valued that a lot, so I'm glad I had the opportunity to do it. And I think it's good thing to good opportunity for students to have.
