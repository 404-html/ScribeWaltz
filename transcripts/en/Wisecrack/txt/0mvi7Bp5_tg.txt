Speaker 1:          00:07          Well, I think that we will probably need some new institutional arrangements before this is over. Um, one that I've called for, uh, in, in a number of places including my book is it's a world environment organization. I've worked in the UN, I can tell you that, uh, if you look across the landscape of the UN agencies, uh, it's probably true that the weakest ones are the ones that are there for the environment. Uh, and that's not good. We need a world environment organization that has the kind of authority and clout that the World Trade Organization has. And that's an easy case to make. Um, but, um, I think the World Bank could have a big role. It could create special arrangements and special facilities to help deal with these issues. And the best thing about the UN program, uh, are in this area are the, uh, you know, basically the, is not appreciated that widely, but all of the international treaties that worked to protect the environment, uh, most of which the US has never ratified a, but all of those treaties, uh, are sponsored by the United Nations.

Speaker 1:          01:24          The these negotiations that happened every year to strengthen the climate treaty. Now looking to a post Kyoto Protocol, uh, looking out to 20, 50 to reduce greenhouse gases. That's, uh, that, that, uh, that process, uh, is, is under the Framework Convention on Climate Change, which is a UN sponsored exercise. And the secretary at sit service those conventions and it's sponsored. The negotiations are UN entities. Uh, and problem is that that system doesn't work nearly well enough. Uh, it's, it's a one country, one vote, a system, and a country's can whittle down these agreements to the point that they're toothless. And the real problem now is not the poor is not weakened forcement of the treaties. Uh, it's not weak compliance with the treaties. It's just, it's a treaty. So toothless, they don't require much in the first place. And so we need to develop some new machinery for international negotiations.
