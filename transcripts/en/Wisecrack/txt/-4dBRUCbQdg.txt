Speaker 1:          00:00          Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:09          well I was still in my parent's basement busily making money, doing our audio visual stuff and I had an older brother at the time who was off in medical school and he's extremely bright guy doing both an md and a phd program and his phd work was in developing therapies for pediatric, in fact, neonatal, uh, cancer patients, babies with leukemia, and he was developing the drug therapies for these neonates, but they're so small, they weigh a couple of pounds. There was no practical equipment out there for him to deliver his therapies. So He'd show up in the basement on trips home from med school and whine and complain about his lack of equipment designed for babies. It wasn't surprising to me that there isn't a lot of equipment for babies because fortunately not a very large piece of the medical population. Unfortunately old people get sick.

Speaker 2:          01:07          Babies don't normally have that problem, but I could sit in the basement and imagine that I could build tiny, tiny little drug delivery systems essentially using a syringe, for instance, as a whole day supply of drug instead of an ivy bottle. So I built for my brothers some little devices that use the syringe as the reservoir and build some electronics and control systems that would allow him to program those things for drug delivery for his research. I think he was very proud of my stuff. I certainly wasn't doing it as a business. I was helping my brother, but he would take it to med schools with him and he ended up doing a little time at Harvard where he met a lot of doctors up in Boston. Then he ended up doing a residency at Yale where he met a lot of the adult docs and one of these docs at one point said, you know, that little thing is so small, it's great that it sits in an isolet moving around with babies, but it's so small you could slap it on the belt or put it in the pocket of an adult who could walk around getting chronic therapy for things that might dramatically improve their healthcare.

Speaker 2:          02:12          Like what? How about insulin for diabetics? So suddenly I took this core technology that I developed for this very rare disease that we owe, lots of people will, will never have to deal with pediatric cancer, and it would serve a very, very broad population of people walking around meeting I insulin to deal with their diabetes. And so we modified the pumps. We moved out of the basement, we started making lots of different, uh, pharmaceutical delivery systems, ended up building an ice company around that. And uh, and to this day, we continue to build stuff for home dialysis, diabetes care. We build lots of products related to helping people get both better therapy and live better, live simultaneous.
