Speaker 1:          00:00          The Buddhist psychology tradition in particular and the Asian psychologies in general, and actually the engine Christian monastic psychology's do have a strong theory and a strong practice really, uh, of overcoming bitterness, hatred, resentment, vengefulness and so forth. Carrying a little further for Moses has already restraining idea of an eye for an eye and tooth for tooth. In other words, you don't take a leg or a life for an eye, you know, or a life for it too. It's, you know, just enough to do this, which was already a step forward from the old engines idea of tribal attitude and a, and Jesus has in Buddha's greater idea of really love your enemies and how to unpack that in a modern city. And people get nervous about it because they think if you love your enemies, your meat, it means you're going to cave to them.

Speaker 1:          00:50          You're going to be a martyr. You're going to invite them to come and destroy you and just be a masochist sense of what. And that is not at all. But it means love means in the Asian psychological term that I think really in any term means the wish for the beloved happiness to want to make the one you love happy. That's what love really is. It isn't really greeted, wished to possess, although some kinds of loves tend to tend to mix with that of the egotistical person. The reason someone is your enemy is they think you are preventing their happiness. Somehow you have something they want, you're in their way. Whatever it is. The world isn't big enough for the both of you type of attitude. And so they want to be your enemy and because they are unhappy and they think by getting rid of you, they will be happy.

Speaker 1:          01:31          So if they were happy already without messing with you, they might be wanting to leave you alone because it's no fun to go attack people. It's like a, it's, it's an exercise, you know, it's not like giving a caress or receiving what so, so loving your enemies is actually practical advice. And Martin Luther King, for example, when he went back the second time, that bridge in Birmingham, a John Lewis says that he, he was advised by his friends, come on, like, don't get into how are we going to love those guys, those cops who were sicking dogs and the hoses and beating us and jailing us and torturing us and that then Martin Luther said, no, uh, Martin Luther King's that no, it's too bitter. A burden to bear hatred and resentment. We do love them. Of course we opposed them and we're against them and we don't want them to behave like that, but we don't hate them.

Speaker 1:          02:22          That's just a ridiculous waste of our energy. And in a way, you can see that being an enemy who has hurt you has already hurt you. If you go around nursing hatred and vindictiveness and how to get back at them, you're hurting yourself. When you oppose your enemy who someone, and, and by, by saying your enemies, someone, they think they're your enemy. Hopefully if you love your enemy, you have no enemy. But if you, when you oppose that person, which you could do, you could have tough love. You can have fierce compassion and when they sense that you're doing it because you want their betterment actually, cause it's not good them to be mean to you and so on, then actually it has a little different edge to it. And for example, if you're trying to get them to see reason, there's a better chance they'll be able to listen to you when they don't feel the weight of hatred and a destructive vibration toward them coming through the speech. They know what's in the style and the energy of his speech. Your motivation will make it more successful.
