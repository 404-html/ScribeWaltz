Speaker 1:          00:00          This video is sponsored by Intel and the upcoming vr film Pale Blue Dot. Stay tuned after this video to learn more about Pale blue dot. Hey, wise crack corporeal. Jared here on the set of earthling cinema, so we just saw star wars, the last Jedi and seems like it's pretty divisive. While the critics seem to love it, it's one of the least liked star wars movies by audience reviews and the wise crack team is similarly divided, but regardless of whether you loved it or hated it, it's hard to deny that the movie took some big interesting risks. It deliberately plays with our expectations of what a star wars movie is. Rethinks the eternal battle between light and dark and questions. The efficacy of heroics. Welcome is wisecrack quick take on the last Jedi and for the love of God, spoilers ahead. If you haven't seen it, go watch it and come back the last July puts forth two major ideas.

Speaker 1:          00:49          One, let go of the past. Kill it. If you have to end to. Don't be a hero. Preserve the light. So let's break down the first one. Should we let the past die? Raise whole reason for seeking out luke, in addition to getting him to join, the resistance is to get answers about her powers and her parents. Rose holds onto a family heirloom that's reminder of her deceased sister and Leah. After the murder of Han Solo is struggling to hold onto the memory of her son. Other characters try to outright reject their past. Luke renounces. The Jetta convinced that the force is about balance, not a bunch of dudes with laser sticks convinced that they're the arbiters of that ballads, even decides to burn the temple, and the foundational texts within luke also rejects his legacy. The legends of Luke Skywalker rose is compelled to part with her past by giving away her precious family.

Speaker 1:          01:36          Ambulant Kylo Ren is killing off the memory of Ben Solo and he also urges rate to forget about who her parents are or his own lineage and join him in a galaxy. We're home. Planets have a tendency to get blowed up. It's not bad advice, but ultimately the film projects this message reasserting the importance of embracing the past. Even though Lucan Yoda burned down the Gi temple, turns out Ray has those foundational texts still safely stashed in her belongings. Luca firms, he won't be the last Jedi, and rose eventually gets her pendant back, but most importantly, luke revives the legend of Luke Skywalker when he confronts Kylo Ren, but more on that later, now onto the next lesson. Don't be a hero preserved the light or more specifically, if being a hero means yelling, Leroy Jenkins in the face of insurmountable odds, then don't do that. This is embodied by Poe who disobeyed his orders and gets a bunch of people killed and taking down a dreadnought and Finn who goes on a suicide mission to destroy the battering Ram Canon.

Speaker 1:          02:30          The whole point of this is to say, when things are so dismal, the battle can't be about winning. The best we can do is preserve the light. This is decidedly a different attitude than other star wars films which characterize the day being saved by Jed. I'm hopping and swings and blowing stuff up, but with Vice Admiral, oh, skepticism of Po, the last jet, I takes a new approach. Fin suicide charges interrupted by roads who tells them that at this stage it's not about defeating the enemy so much as protecting what you love, except that's exactly what Finn was trying to do and after admonishing po for the entire film, Vice Admiral, Oh, saves the transport ships by sacrificing herself and ramming the first order cruiser more or less what Finn tried, but in space. So what the hell? Star Wars. By the way, if you want to hear more of that kind of fan rage, check out our last episode of our movie podcast.

Speaker 1:          03:18          Show me the meaning. It's available wherever you get your podcasts. Anyway, it's in Luke's arc in which we see these two themes of the past and heroism collide in a really interesting way. Most of the movies shows luke incessantly refusing to get off his ass and join. The rebellion is even confronted with the exact same call to adventure as episode four, which he also initially refused, but this time he refuses for like two hours precedent joining up with the cause like he did an episode four. He does something else. He projects his image to the rebel holdout echoing roses, words he's not here to defeat the enemy, but to preserve the light by saving his sister and stalling the first order. He projects his image and dies from the tremendous energy the feet requires, but why didn't he just go in person and kill Kylo or at the very least, let Kylo strike him down all our ob one, because the galaxy doesn't need a hero.

Speaker 1:          04:08          They need a symbol. While layers call for assistance fell on deaf ears. The final scene of the film details poor exploited children of Canto bight retelling the story of Luke skywalker surviving the impossible barrage of fire. This is where Luke comes to accept his legacy and his past. This revitalized legends of Luke Skywalker will inspire more people to join the resistance. Then layers cries for help. Luke Skywalker as a symbol will do more for the resistance. Then Luke Skywalker, the man ever could. There's another reason I find this really interesting. The original star wars was heavily inspired by Classic Westerns with its ensemble of outlaws and the lawlessness of open space, and in that tradition, Johnson takes an idea that we see in classic Westerns like the man who shot liberty valance and Fort Apache in both films and undeserving character is enshrined in legend for the greater good of the West and the man who shot liberty balance the false narrative that the idealistic ransom stoddard killed the seemingly unkillable liberty valance brings order to the west and in Fort Apache, the lie that captain Thursday died, a noble hero enables the US military to continue its duty. He must have been a great name,

Speaker 1:          05:20          great. Norman died more gallantly. Luke skywalker may not have been the hero people thought he was, but belie created around his epic last stand. We'll go on to spark the next wave of resistance in a quote that equally describes all three movies. A reporter in the man who shot liberty balance, proclaims, and the legend becomes fact. Print the legend the last July even uses the western tropes of a retired Gunslinger, hesitant to enter back into the world of violence. Now, if you'll allow us to get Meta for a second, there's another way of thinking about all this. The force awakens in dealing with its own past decided to make a more or less scene for scene remake, a new hope, but unlike Jj Abrams, writer, director Ryan Johnson, did something much different. Johnson took the fundamental building blocks of star wars for saw audience expectations and deliberately subverted them every step of the way.

Speaker 1:          06:10          In many ways, the last jet is similar to the empire strikes back a wannabe jet. I traveled to an isolated planet to be trained, ignores their masters advice, then finds out who their parents are, even swapped out billy dee Williams for Bco del Toro, betrayal and all. However, in the last jet, I are mentor refuses to help and raise. Parents aren't legendary Jetta. I bought junkers who sold her for booze, money and snow just dies with no fleshed out backstory. When I first saw the gaping dark hole in the last jet, I was like, oh, this looks familiar, but unlike Luke, Rey finds nothing there. It was a deliberate misdirect. And finally, and I'm still a little unsure about this, the powdery white base is pretty much the same as hoth, but covered in salt instead of snow. I was a little confused as to be very deliberate proclamation that the white powder was salt.

Speaker 1:          06:58          But here's what I've got salting the earth. In ancient history, salting land was a way to curse the land and prevent anything from being built on top of it as salt is toxic to crops is Johnson salting the earth of Star Wars Lore. By redefining the resistance and what it means to be a hero. Also, unlike the original trilogy which finds its heroes and princesses and people with quote unquote noble blood, the last Jedi Knight does a lot of work to move away from this narrative. Our heroes are fin, a janitor rose, a pipe mechanic, and ray, who we learn is not the descendant of a powerful family lineage like the Skywalker's but junkers. And unlike the rest of the film, which seemingly argues for preserving the past, the last gi is moving away from the narrative model that defined its predecessors. So what do you think wise crack was the last jet, a cinematic masterpiece or a medic laurian dumpster fire also will be doing an ama for the first hour of this video gets released.

Speaker 1:          07:52          We'll have a pinned comment or you can ask us about star wars, how we work, my favorite Korean barbecue restaurant. My dog would eat or anything else you want to know? As always, thank you so much for watching guys piece the last shit. I's amazing story wouldn't have been possible without the technology needed to power it. In that same vein, Intel is paving the way for emotional stories in virtual reality dedicated to innovation and technology and content. Intel is supporting the vr film Pale Blue Dot, allowing audiences to explore their way through deep space where earth is just a speck in the cosmos. Inspired by the iconic Pale blue dot photograph.
