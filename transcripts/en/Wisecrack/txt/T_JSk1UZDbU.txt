Speaker 1:          00:00          This video is sponsored by Intel and the upcoming vr film Pale Blue Dot. Stay tuned after this video to learn more about Pale blue dot. Hey guys, three dimensional jared here. The first three seasons of bojack showed us a protagonist that despite his Hollywood success, struggled to find meaning. Buck season three ended with hope bojack runs away from La and stairs that or heard of galloping horses, potentially embracing the idea that he's free to choose who he wants to be, which brings us to the core of the new season. Our ability to define and redefine our own narratives, woken lists very late wisecrack quick take on bojack horseman season four, and as always, spoilers ahead. Wrapped up in this season is what I'm going to call the narrative self, that how we experience things and remember things are intricately wrapped up in the stories we tell about ourselves. As philosopher Michael Geza, Niga says, we're natural storytellers.

Speaker 1:          00:56          After the brain computes and event the illusory we, that is the mind, becomes aware of it. In other words, the way we think and understand the world and ourselves is literally through stories, series creator. Raphael Bob Waxford has spoken about this idea of self narrative and bojack because of the narrative we've experienced, we've kind of internalize this idea that we're working towards some great ending and that if we put all our ducks in a row will be rewarded and everything will finally make sense. It's a struggle and we're all trying to figure it out, and these characters are trying to figure it out for themselves. This struggle to redefine one's own narrative is integrally bound up with each character's happiness. Everyone moves closer towards happiness as they move further away from the past. Escaping the death of Sarah Lynn bojack drives to his family summer home and tries to redefine his own narrative that he's a person who tries to be a handyman but can't fix anything before later recasting himself as a tragic hero who's bojack horseman, who's bojack Horseman.

Speaker 1:          01:54          He's a very famous TV and film star, or he was, yeah, before he gave it all up for a life of quiet anonymity. Instead of making any real inroads into redefining his own character, bojack ends up reliving the past that justifies his own self-loathing. All the wildest show overlap the narrative of his mother's abusive childhood. A cycle continued as she raised bojack. Well, Jack's life turns around when he befriends a dragon fly named Eddie who refuses to fly following his wife's debt, but after Eddie tries to kill them both bojack season Eddie's fixation on the past as a cautionary tale about what grounding your narrative and a longing for the past can do. So the next day in typical bojack style, he hires a wrecking crew to level the sugarman house. Uh, yeah. You think I just want to mope around in a shrine to the past, getting off of my own guilt while the rest of my life passes me by authentic much Princess Carolyn struggles to redefine the family narrative that she can do it all on her own as she tries to get pregnant.

Speaker 1:          02:49          I don't need other options. My mother had 12 kids. My body was made for this. We just got to keep tip. There's even a whole episode framed as a presentation by Princess Carolyn's future descendant. That is actually just a story. Princess Carolyn tells herself to cope with the president. She used her current hardships as what philosopher war freeman called Frodo narrative, or a story yet to happen. It's the ending. What happens next that gives these moments meaning, for example, say, did you ever hear the story of the couple have moved to California? I can't say, oh, it's a marvelous adventure. You see, they hardly knew each other, but they shared a certain sensitivity at a tastes for the unknown. They were living in a one horse town, so they headed west towards a town that could accommodate three horses. Oh yes. I think I have heard this story.

Speaker 1:          03:39          I got a small house in San Francisco near the bookstore, except she doesn't know what happens next, so in order to cling to the old narrative that she'll be fine and fertile, she invents her own ending, and when I think about that, I think about how everything's going to work out because how else could you tell people what the show tells us that this narrative is misguided as symbolized by her cherished family necklace that turns out to be nothing more than worthless costume jewelry. Season four offers a solution to these ailments. In what Michael White and David Epston called narrative therapy. The point is to help patients re author their identity by focusing on what they value and then creating a narrative that will help them pursue those values. Nowhere is this more apparent than in bojack must learn to overcome the narrative that he's a terrible person, especially in regards to Holly Hawk.

Speaker 2:          04:26          I don't want to, but every time she looks at me with those big innocent eyes, all I can think about is every thing I've ever done and I think I don't deserve that kind of love.

Speaker 1:          04:34          We actually get to hear bojack self narrative through his inner monologue,

Speaker 2:          04:38          your real stupid pieces, but I know I'm a piece of that at least makes me better than all the pieces of who don't know are pieces of it.

Speaker 1:          04:45          Making things worse. Bojack's forced to live with his abusive mother, Beatrice, even though bojack's no longer living in a shrine to the past, still logging for the love of a mother who doesn't recognize him. When bojack inevitably does something bad, it just viciously perpetuates this negative narrative starting the cycle all over again. However, bojack may have finally broken the cycle when he owns up to his actions with hollyhock. You are an amazing woman and after Beatrice Laces hollyhocks coffee with embedded means bojack lets it go rather than perpetuating this multigenerational tale of abuse and revenge. When Beatrice finally recognizes Bojack, he stops looking for validation that will fix the past. He just sees her as she is a sickly old lady and in the least bojack moment of his life, he's kind to her. He don't understand. You're in Michigan, Michigan. Yeah. At the lake house it. It's a. it's a warm summer night in. The fireflies are dancing in the sky and your whole family is here and they're telling you that everything is going to be all right. In a final act of selflessness, he lets hollyhocks eight dad's tell her that bojack is actually her brother instead of claiming the good deed for himself, but as a reward, bojack gains something else. I told you from the beginning, I have eight dad's. Yeah, good, but I've never had a brother.

Speaker 1:          06:16          Meanwhile, Princess Carolyn tells us the stories we tell ourselves aren't always real.

Speaker 3:          06:21          I got into this business because I love stories. They comfort us, they inspire us, they create a context for how we experience the world, but also you have to be careful because if you spend a lot of time with stories, you start to believe that life is just stories and it's not. Life is life,

Speaker 1:          06:40          so what do you think wise crack. Can people really change themselves by changing their own narratives? Let us know what you think in the comments section, just as bojack is reshaping what an animated Sitcom can be. Intel is doing the same for storytelling in virtual reality, dedicated to content and technology innovation, Intel behind the vr film Pale blue dot, allowing audiences to explore their way through deep space where earth is just a speck in the cosmos, inspired by the iconic Pale blue dot photograph. The film brings other worlds to life with visual effects, sound design, and an original score under the direction of indie filmmaker Eliza mcnitt. The film is part of Intel's commitment to empower vr filmmakers, which is pretty cool. While the film premieres in early 2018, the first episode of the making of Pale blue dot, the behind the scenes mini series is live now.

Speaker 1:          07:31          The series offers key snapshots of McKnight's journey with her fellow filmmakers. In this new media, we get to follow the team as they tackle new challenges like what it means to tell a story when audiences have meaningful control of the experience and why is crack. We've consistently seen great filmmaking come through, learning to think on your feet and adapt. It's cool to see those same principles applied to Vr and on this scale.
