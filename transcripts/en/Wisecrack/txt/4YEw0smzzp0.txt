Speaker 1:          00:06          Hey wisecrack jared again and today we're taking a look at the show that tears to ask the question, how much body horror can we realistically animate in 22 minutes? I'm talking about Netflix is devilishly good anime offering devil man cry baby. While you may know it by its reputation as that show with lots of incredibly violent humping cartoon boobs and incredibly violent cartoon boobs. Domain crybaby has some deep things to say about metaphysics, the media and even international relations. So welcome with his wives crack condition on the philosophy of devil man crybaby has always spoilers ahead. And by the way, we never get it right whether you guys want dubs or sub. So we literally flipped a coin in Atlanta, did on dubs, so be happy. But before we get into the recap though, I just want you all to know we're working hard to put together an animate podcast.

Speaker 1:          00:53          It's in very early stages, but a lot of our best video ideas start from podcasts discussions. So subscribe to our channel wise cast. You get a closer look into our creative process. Anyway. Onto the recap. Akira, a teenage boy known for crying over almost anything is living with the Maki Mora family while his parents traveled the world providing free medical care when he tries to save his crush. Slash. Housemate Mickey Mckee, Maura from what looks like a gang, Aki raise interrupted by his trigger. Happy adoptive brother and childhood friend Rio. Recently back in Japan. After a research project in South America, Rio tells Akira what he learned abroad, namely that devils are real and that they are possessing human beings trying to collect proof of his theories. Rio Takes Acura to a drug fueled sex party called Sabbath, where his bloody rampage actually succeeds in summoning a group of demons, one of whom tries to possess Acura.

Speaker 1:          01:46          That demon Ayman fails to take over Akira completely. Acura gains the strength and power of a devil, but he's still in control of his mind and body. You're a man who possesses both the body of a devil as well as the heart of a human devil. Man, while Rio and occupy initially planned to use his powers to fight the devils, the show gradually reveals that there's more to Rio's plan when the demon thread is revealed to the Public Rio gains. Immense influence with world leaders turns on OC Euro and promotes policies which encouraged the murder of not only devils, but millions of human beings. This all comes to a head in the big reveal. You seen him say, Yup. Followed by a massive human devil, devil, man battle culminating in the end of the world. So how did we get from a bad night at the club to the fricking apocalypse?

Speaker 1:          02:35          Well, the answer has to do with two distinct but related concepts, moral panics and threat construction. Sociologists, Stanley Cohen, argues that mass media constructs a moral panic directed at certain groups of people by portraying their behavior as deviant society labels these people a threat which justifies excessive social control and policing over the quote demonized as he puts it. The media informs us about right and wrong about the boundaries beyond which one should not venture and about the shapes that the devil can assume. Devil may cry. Baby references a few well known moral panics. For instance, local news falsely identifies the young rappers as members of a gang. The mistake and their resemblance to be constructed. Stereotype of violent youth nearly gets them shot by police even as they try to cooperate with the officers. The show also references the archetypal moral panic which hunts for her almost supernatural speed.

Speaker 1:          03:33          Miki is known to the media as up is reach of track and field. As a result, the mob calls her a witch. She's an outsider before killing her and burning her body. More to the point though is reos use of mass media to create a moral panic over devils after triggering code has transformation at the track meet and causing a massacre. Rio uses his live stream too, so fear and mistrust among the general population, demons exist. That could be one right next to you taking advantage of his academic title. Rio claims to be merely a reporter of the facts. In fact, he uses multiple media outlets including social media and traditional broadcasting to promote as much fear, paranoia, and violence as possible

Speaker 2:          04:18          in this battle. Huggins,

Speaker 1:          04:21          I'm sure that we will win. Once again. As the end of the world draws closer, Satan slash Rio encourages more and more violence by expanding the definition of devils to include anyone deviating from the social norm. He falsely implies that deviant behavior is a proven indicator of the potential to turn into a devil.

Speaker 2:          04:40          So you're saying that anyone dissatisfied with society can potentially turn into a demon? That's correct. So then in order for us to defeat the demons, we must eradicate them before they become demons.

Speaker 1:          04:52          He pulls off the same feet at the international level. Through our process. Scholars call the red construction. Certain camps of foreign policy theorists argue that many international trends positive by national leaders are largely constructed. That is issues become threats when people in positions of power define them as such, like creating a moral panic. Threat. Construction involves identifying some other, whether it be another country and organization, et Cetera, and defining its otherness as a danger. The other is portrayed as not merely a physical threat, but a threat to the very identity of a domestic state political scientist. David Campbell explains that in the process of threat construction, the other becomes the barbarian who stands in opposition to the quote civilized self. Following this model, Rio manipulates inherent weaknesses in US foreign policy to start world war three beginning a nuclear conflict which wipes human life from existence. Rio takes part in a high level government discussion about how to handle the threat posed by the devils. By this point, we're leaders have bought into reos logic completely and have become distrustful of one another. We must be careful of the movements of neighboring countries. There's information that they've already been taken over by the demons. In response to the situation, the u s government reflexively identifies a Russia as a quote, geography of evil, a term coined by Campbell and declares the devil. Possessions are the product of a Russian bioweapon.

Speaker 3:          06:17          The U s department of National Defense closed its borders in response to the possibility of demons being rushes biological weapons

Speaker 1:          06:25          in devil man crybaby, the u s and Russia respond to the devil's much as real world governments respond to terrorism because the threat is barbaric and a threat to civilization. No measure is too extreme to stop them including nuclear war.

Speaker 4:          06:39          No, I like this. The minute sure threatens our cow.

Speaker 1:          06:42          The show explores the dangers of throwing up artificial boundaries between groups. The bloodshed and heartbreak that fills up the last few episodes are a direct result of the public's willingness to buy into rios us versus them mentality.

Speaker 5:          06:56          Maybe you can run faster than people because you're a demon. You think you're better than the Japanese.

Speaker 1:          07:02          This preoccupation with boundaries is also reflected in the show's exploration of what's called dual list metaphysics. So what does that mean? Doulas and posits that reality is binary or oppositional in nature, composed of two eternally clashing irreconcilable forces such as good and evil. One of the classic examples of the list philosophy is the ancient religion of Manichaean as religious scholar Todd calder explains according to Manichaean dualism, the universe is the product of an ongoing battle between good and evil substances, which are in a constant battle for supremacy. At first glance, the show appears full of binary oppositions, which will never be resolved. For instance, Rio is distinguished from AH, era by his inability to shed tears, which serves as a visual cue for the ability to feel emotion.

Speaker 4:          07:47          Why would I cry? I'm not sad it was going to die. Anyway,

Speaker 1:          07:51          the show also sets up a sharp divide between fear based violence and the Maki. Morris Christian passivism, one of the people who was following Jesus pulled out his sword, attack the soldier and cut off his ear. So then Jesus said to him, put away your sword and return it to the sheath. Rio is a doulas to the core. He describes Devil's as fundamentally lacking in the human capacity to feel

Speaker 5:          08:15          devils have existed on earth since long before humans. They are ferocious, extremely savage and have no emotions.

Speaker 1:          08:23          What's more? The show takes that Manichaean idea of a battle between good and evil substances very literally real first discovers the existence of devils when the corpse of his formerly possessed professor is revealed to wait twice the size it was when he was alive. This possession, in other words was not only spiritual but physical. A case of two bodies, one good and the other evil fighting for the same space. The show emphasizes the material dimensions of this battle between good and evil. Whenever a devil successfully takes over a human host, often ripping apart their body in the process over time, however, devil man crybaby winds up turning this dualistic model completely on its head. The show reveals the socially constructed nature of the dichotomies many of his characters take for granted and argues that reality is far too complex to be put in terms of black and white.

Speaker 1:          09:12          As panic over the devil's thread reaches its tipping point. The show blurs the line between good and evil. One of the more obvious examples is Akira, who by his very nature challenges reos, dualistic model of the world. In one person, he combines devil and human good and evil. We see this when Auc euro in his devil man form stands between an angry lynch mob and its targets and offers up his life for theirs. Why Chili Java? If you're going to kill someone, just chill van stead, defying the angry and fearful humans expectations. By contrast, we see an example of supposedly good humans resorting to evil when the mob dismembers and Burns Mucky, mucky Maura for her public supportive Akira and other devilment devil man crybaby also loves to play around with dichotomies surrounding gender and sex. The show regularly hints at an ambiguous Lee Queer relationship between hockey era and Rio.

Speaker 1:          10:07          Aqua remains invested in his ability to openly display emotion even after being mocked for it as a child, what the heck is crying? Even though he's a boy? And in his final form, Satan embodies both male and female sex characteristics, but perhaps most interesting is the way the show blurs. The line between devils stand ins for the outcasts and scapegoats of society and the humans they're supposed to be so different from Mr Machimura eventually finds his wife and their son, Toro in a refugee camp. Unfortunately for him, it isn't the reunion he'd hoped for. Toro now possessed by the devil can't control his own hunger any longer. His father arrives to find him in his demonic form, eating his own mother. Mr Machimura tries to fall back on these socially constructed dichotomy between devils and humans to reduce Tarro twin evil creature and make some sense of the horror confronting him. God are no longer my sweet son. This is for your Oh God, but in the end he can't help but see his human son in the devil's crying eyes, please don't show. Dot.

Speaker 1:          11:15          The show also provides plenty of evidence to exhibit that contrary to Rio's claim that devils are incapable of emotion. They're actually quite capable of feeling love for each other and in some cases for humans in the episode, Beautiful Siren, a cure. It gets into what can only be described as a deadly sex battle with styrene, the former lover of acuras devil. Amen. In the first round of their fight, Acura and nearly kills siren, but as she lies bleeding out, her partner came, comes to her aid, offering new give up his life so that she can merge with his body and live long enough to kill devil man site bloodied. You won't be able to fall. Came sacrifice even causes siren to cry. Most impressive of all is the change that comes over Satan himself. As a result of his experiences with Akira, having revealed his true form to Akira, Satan admits that he made the merging between him and Ayman possible so that Okoro would be able to survive the apocalypse and live with him forever. Oh, a Kiddo. Let's live in the new world together. I made you merge with the champion. Amen. For that very reason. What's more when Satan Kills Aki era during their battle, he came up the devils experiences grief for the first time and cries over era his body.

Speaker 6:          12:36          He's awfully

Speaker 1:          12:42          by pointing out fluidity where we would expect to find hard boundaries. Dell man crybaby asks us to think hard about the labels we apply to others and the potential consequences of black and white thinking. The show puts forward some tough questions. Who benefits from media scapegoating and to what ends? To what extent does rhetoric play a role in the identification of threats and what are the dangers of being too ready to draw lines between self and other and in a world where categories as basic as good and evil are the product of manipulation and deliberate construction? What is the right thing to do as Mikko and her blended human devil man form puts it,

Speaker 6:          13:22          what does it mean to be a human? What does it mean to be guide? If you're going to die, hurry up what is right

Speaker 1:          13:29          and as always he's
