Speaker 1:          00:00          This video is sponsored by movement watches in sunglasses, more on movement at the end of the video. Yep.

Speaker 2:          00:16          Greetings and welcome to earthlink cinema. I am your host Garrick's warm you Lloyd. This week's artifact is Django unchained starring disabled musician Ray Charles, and directed by podiatrist Quintin Tarantino as a prequel to his earlier movie, the Hitler buddies. The film begins in Texas just before the first of America's seven civil wars. Our protagonist is King Schults and inexplicably German bounty hunter who buys an anthropomorphic piece of property named Django in order to give him a makeover. Now sufficiently dolled up. They travel around from town to town, spreading the gospel of getting shot in the face. At one point, an army of ghosts tries to stop them, but every good bounty hunter knows a ghosts. Greatest weakness. Buster

Speaker 3:          01:02          [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          01:04          [inaudible] seasons, sadly comes to an end. So rather than split up earth's first ever interracial business friendship, sholtz decides to help reunite Django with his wife, broom, Hilda, another piece of property who is also German for absolutely no reason. They find her at a soup plantation called candy land on the outskirts of the peppermint forest. Her owner, Calvin candy land is a real sportsman in the sense that he likes to sit on a sofa watching grown men UFC each other to death. So Schultz and Jango pretend to be interested in buying some of Calvin's living sports equipment for $12,000 which due to inflation equals about 89 quintillion blog electrons. They try to throw broom Hilda into the deal, all casual like, but Calvin's dad, steven doesn't mess around when it comes to his hard earned blogger drones. He correctly guesses that they know broom Hilda from before the opening credit started. So Calvin does the very reasonable thing of raising the price to match their demand. It going to be dodge, good old fashion capitalism. They signed the revised contract and everything works out great for everyone and of movie,

Speaker 4:          02:11          right? Right.

Speaker 2:          02:15          Oh, that's right. There hasn't been nearly enough human blood schultes decides his pride is the most valuable substance on earth, even more than truffled petroleum. So rather than risk touching Calvin's greasy little arm clause, he chooses to get himself killed. Django is captured and sold to a bitcoin mine with long hours and no health benefits. Oh Day everyday. On the way there, Django uses his graduate level education to hoodwink some unsuspecting and entirely unnecessary Australians then travels back through the molasses swamp to candyland. He explodes everything without much conflict. And finally, he in Broome, Hilda right off together on to land sea horses now and movie Django unchained is first and five most a slavery revenge fantasy white images stained with blood represent the vengeance wreaked upon white slavers the two colors combining into a more pleasing pinkish hue. Violence against white people is frequently depicted in grotesque stylized detail.

Speaker 2:          03:18          The massacre at candy land is so cartoonish that we have no choice but to contract our diaphragms in a laughing manner like this. Ha Ha. In contrast, violence against slaves is more realistic and often portrayed indirectly and the climax of the paper view UFC fight the spilled gumballs serve as a proxy for blood and guts and our diaphragms remained static as the killing strike is blocked from view like this. The horrifying scene where dogs rip D'artagnan apart is mostly portrayed through reaction shots. And Oscar nominated sound sounded. The film takes inspiration from widely disparate sources, from Spaghetti Westerns to Ravioli blaxploitation films all the way to German spaetzle who knew the, there's a name of a character in the most popular of old German legends, but at its heart, Django unchained as an example of a revisionist western wear. Traditional Hollywood westerns emphasized mythical American themes such as manifest destiny and calling people pilgrim.

Speaker 2:          04:21          Jake, your Ese there. Revisionist westerns provided a different perspective addressing the exploitation of native Americans and the decline of the cowboy era. In light of industrialization, Django unchained takes aim at slavery's power structures by showing that they were perpetuated by frauds. Big Daddy initially makes a big fuss about a black man riding one of allows creatures on his land, which threatens to undercut his dominion. He's a free man. He can ride what he pleases, not on my property, but he immediately caves when Schultz offers them a financial teat from whence he can suckle. I have 5,000 things I might say that could change your mind. Come on inside and get yourself something cool to drink. Calvin pretends to be a James Franco file is a bit of a Franco file, which reflects his opinion that he's better than everyone else. In reality, he's just another ignorant heck with the hots for his sister to select can fish.

Speaker 2:          05:15          He doesn't speak French, don't speak French to him. It'll embarrass him. Sholtz and Django are able to easily infiltrate these power structures by using the very illusions that reinforced them. Plus, you know money Schultes plays the Genteel dentist to put people at ease with Novacane and gain the element of surprise. What kind of Dennis? Augie, you haven't practiced dentistry in five years after Django is captured, is able to convince his captors not only to release him but to arm him gun belt because they assume the power structures protecting immigrants in America will hold and they did hold at least until America was met with the greatest immigrant of all and asteroid made of dark matter earthling
