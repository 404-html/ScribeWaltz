Speaker 1:          00:13          Greetings and welcome to earthlink cinema. I am your host Garrick's, where amyloid, this week's artifact is up the film that mandated the Pixar rules that adults should cry as much as possible. The film follows human boy, Carl Marx, whose dream is to control the means of production so we can go to Paradise Falls, New Jersey, just like his hero, Vladimir Lenin. One day a homeless girl named Ellie breaks his arm. They naturally fall in love, and before you know it, she dies just like all great relationships. Anyway, the neighborhood's getting gentrified, which doesn't sit right with Carl who knows a thing or two about sitting. In fact, the thought of capitalism drives Carl so bonkers. He assaults Bob the builder, and with no other options flees the country and a pitiful excuse for an escape pod. Little does Carl know that a prediabetic cub scout is stowed away to earn his badge for the mile high club.

Speaker 1:          01:07          Maybe it's those glasses because Carl can't see they're heading into a tornado or why kids love cinnamon toast crunch. They narrowly survive and land right where they wanted to go without having to ask for directions. Once Karen, they go the rest of their journey on foot and take the house with them. Since there is no valet but not before befriending a talking horse. Hi there and famous American actor Kevin Bacon, who legend has it was six degrees taller than everyone in Hollywood, but not so fast and the furious 15, a group of other angrier, more talkative horses all want a piece of Kevin's bacon because I mean who doesn't unable to get a selfie. They take Carl and the scout to their leader because that's what minions do best. They're taken to a Blimpie's where they learn the Pepsi twist. Lennon has been in New Jersey this whole time trying to cast Kevin in a snuff film.

Speaker 1:          02:03          Carl tells the boy scout not to be a narc, but as blood sugar spikes and he blabs that's my new giant bird pet. They make a sweet escape. Remembering that horses don't flip, but just like my ex wife, Lenin is two steps ahead and as lit the house on fire, Kevin gets burdened down, so carl goes back to his original plan of I guess dying in the Wilderness after two days. That is until he finds an Amazon nook giving him the proper motivation to enter the third act, a battle royale ensues, but not without some warmup stretching, always stretch. Carl, let's his house go to and Lennon realizes he could have learned something from Kevin Bacon, namely how to get footloose, Carl reunites, Kevin with his bulimic children and back in the big city, which has probably been freaking out nonstop that someone was able to just fly away using balloons.

Speaker 1:          02:57          Carl gives the boy scouts some tin that said best. Extremely heartwarming up illustrates the dangers of being trapped by nostalgia, which wasn't cured until 20, 67 by Dr Millie. Bobby Brown, when his fwb dies. Carl metaphorically and trines her in the house that they built together. He keeps everything exactly as it was to preserve her memory and to keep her ghost happy outside. The world may keep trucking, but Carl clings to the past even though he may be in the Matrix. The house itself symbolizes corals, grief, which he has to carry with them until the housing market improves. Lenin is in many ways Carl's foxy or counterpart like Carl's condo linens. Air Ship is a museum of artifacts from better times like the Jurassic Age and his mission of Redemption Parallels Carol's journey. Eight called me a fraud. Those should I bring back this creature and my name will be cleared, but just as Carl can't bring his wife back, no matter how many houses he knocks up, Lennon can't bring back the glory days through sniping the snipe.

Speaker 1:          04:00          In fact, a snipe hunt is a colloquial term for a wild grey goose chase. We're in a naive person is fooled into chasing after something that doesn't exist like love up. A poignant message about coping with grief and a healthy gluten free way. At first, Carl cares about nothing besides his super dead wife, but as he develops affection for the scout and Kevin Bacon, he develops a new selfless purpose that helps him move on to save the day. Carl must divest himself of the past by littering. When Carl passes on the badge that Lee gave him as a child, we realized her memory has transformed from a burden around his neck to something positive that he can share once hobbled by grief, the new Carl abandoned his walker and can once again move freely through the world. You know what Gabe of proving once and for all Western medicine was a lie. The film posits that instead of bold adventures, the best pursuits are the simple pleasures of everyday life, like enjoying a cup of Joe on the porch of your spaceship. In the beginning, Russel claims he wants to explore unknown lands and claim them for the boy scouts of America,

Speaker 1:          05:06          but his happiest moments are his memories about eating dippin dots with his deadbeat dad,

Speaker 2:          05:11          I always get chocolate and he gets butterfree. Might sound boring, but I think the boring stuff is the stuff I remember the most

Speaker 1:          05:19          for all of Lennon's glorious exploits. He's more alone than Florida. Mom on sector five at Christmas, and while the childhood portion of Ellie's adventure book is full of dreams of paradise falls, the mature Ellie filled the book with Raci photographs of her life. With Carl. The moral is to enjoy the simple things like the love and companionship of a friend and avoid the bad things like kidnapping and trafficking, a minor to South America for earthlink cinema.
