Speaker 1:          00:08          Hello, now, do I think that there will be newspaper men and women's? Yes, too. I think that the New York Times will survive the Internet. Absolutely. Their traffic is unbelievable striking. Um, do I think most cities in Israel as well? I'm just not sure. They're only hope and their aim. So says the big man at the top of the boards is to go local. So even the Los Angeles Times is being pressured to become a local newspaper in a larger sense of what local is in La. So there are very few truly national papers left and foreign bureaus are by the gear are being cut down. Um, the biggest problem is I understood as I see that the newspapers face is that websites like google glean off the content from a newspaper without the revenue from that content going to the newspaper. In other words, google hat makes revenue from these ads, but they get the content for vr virtually for free.

Speaker 1:          01:05          Um, you have a whole generation, my generation and younger who is starting to expect print news for free. They were up in arms because they were being asked to pay $50 a year for the New York Times Tacan, which I find, again, absurd that they would be so aghast over that. Um, you know, I think newspapers are in trouble. It's a terrible time to be a reporter. There's no doubt about that. There's less jobs, there's less demand in, uh, in the American public for international news and there's less demand clearly to our less desire among people to pay for their news. So now I don't think it's a good time.
