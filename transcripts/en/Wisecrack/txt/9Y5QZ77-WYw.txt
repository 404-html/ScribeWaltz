Speaker 1:          00:09          Hey wisecrack disembodied. Jared here, grab that potato chip because we're talking about the animate phenomenon. Death note while death note addresses a range of philosophical topics spanning from property rights to human nature. One of the most interesting is justice. What is it and how should it be applied? Justice is hardly a new topic in media, so why is death notes so special? Well whereas most pop culture gives us a cut and dry idea of justice. Death note is unique not in what it says about justice but how it goes about saying it. Woken was wise crack condition on the philosophy of death note and even though this show is 10 years old, spoilers ahead. Also a quick note about dubs vs subs. Seems like no matter what we do, we somehow do it wrong, so we're just going to use the dubs on this one because it's easier for us to work with.

Speaker 1:          00:57          Hey, that's more time for us to read and write and make more episodes so please don't hate us. Death note follows light your gummy as he discovers the death. Note a notebook that can kill anyone by writing their name minute and picturing their face light. A model student wants to use the death note to create a world devoid of crime soon after he adopts the public persona of Kira, the god of the new world. He hopes to create of course anonymously killing huge swaths of criminals, places him in conflict with various law enforcement agencies, a mysterious detective name l and his two successors and an m in death note. We see multiple characters exploring what is and isn't justice. Let's just say the word comes up a lot. I am justice, justice, justice, justice, justice, justice, justice, but the cool thing is the show doesn't give us a clear stance on what constitutes justice, but rather employs a unique method to constantly challenge various definitions of it.

Speaker 1:          01:53          An element of that method happens in how individual characters propose their own version of justice and first among these is light himself. It's hard to get a good sense of who liked was prior to the death note. Although we have some clues to his moral compass, it must be something wrong with me to even consider it. And his sense of moral obligation, this world is rotting, knows who are making it right, deserve to die. Someone has to do it. So why not me? Kira is an ends justify the means Kinda guy. Essentially the ends of being a crime zapping uber tyrant justify pretty much anything including shamelessly using his girlfriend to distract the police and maximize his kill. Count

Speaker 2:          02:33          the Berlin and killed my parents. To me, Kathy hero

Speaker 1:          02:38          and killing people who aren't even criminals who get in his way. However, once light renounces ownership with the notebook, I here by four fit ownership at this notebook, he loses his memories of being Kira and his personality changes noticeably as does his sense of justice. He goes from being a by any means necessary kind of dude to a, well, maybe I shouldn't always be asshole kind of dude. This is shown by his refusal to even use misses feelings in order to get information. To me exploiting another person's feelings for personal gain is unforgivable and I won't allow myself to stoop that low. This is a huge change from the guy who pretends to love her for years just because it was convenient for killing people. Light is even told by me so that she doesn't mind being used for his cause.

Speaker 3:          03:20          I already told you I don't care even if all you're doing here with me

Speaker 1:          03:23          think that would be enough. But he always goes an extra step out of the way to break his promises to her. Here is a bit of a boy, but light minus the notebook seems to respect me. So at least enough not to lead her on,

Speaker 3:          03:35          hey, want to come sleep with me tonight? What are you talking about?

Speaker 1:          03:40          Once he touches the death note again and regains his memories and powers his Kira Persona returns and he moves in with Misa almost immediately to get even more bonus killing power. In other words, treating people well is thrown out the window for justice with a capital j. There are countless examples of this tension between light pre and post notebook, although they merge more and more toward the end of the show. One of the ways this is portrayed is through lights, conversations with himself or he grapples with moral and practical dilemmas. Does that split personality sound familiar? Well, Ross process but you were hosting both death note and Lord of the rings are likely to send in some an ancient Greek story called the ring of guidelines. Essentially a guy finds a ring that makes him invisible and using this anonymity he immediately bangs that King's wife kills the king and takes over whatever spooky Greek magic town he lives in.

Speaker 1:          04:32          We could probably read this as an allegory for the perils of Internet comment sections, but I digress. In Plato's Republic, this story raises a lot of questions about the idea of justice. The character glaucon who was actually plato's real life big brother uses the fable to argue that justice is just the kind of social contract that keeps people from hurting each other. The thought experiment is meant to demonstrate that people only really value justice for its ability to make them look good. In other words, it's only natural that someone within visibility ring would go around acting like an ass hat because people only value justice or morality when their actions can be scrutinized. Sound familiar?

Speaker 4:          05:10          Humans will always try to maintain appearances when they're in public. That's just how we are, but this is how they really feel. Most are too afraid to support me as they're worried about what others will think. Many would rather deny my existence, but on the Internet where you can remain anonymous, support for Kita is growing. As

Speaker 1:          05:28          soon as the risk of damaging your reputation is gone. So is all your interest in justice. Glaucon goes on to say that it doesn't matter if you were just or unjust before putting on the ring. The power will inevitably lead you to be a bag of dicks and that's okay. I can use the death note all I want and I won't be punished according to glaucon. If you can secretly bang the queen and still keep your reputation, you will be way happier than someone who cares about justice and banks. Zero Queens. And that's pretty much a light. The boy Valedictorian who puts on a show of normal morality even when he takes joy in doing stuff that is probably way worse than breaking the Royal Bro Code.

Speaker 4:          06:07          I never once felt cursed since I picked up the death. No, in fact, the thought never even crossed my mind. I'm happier than I've ever been. Oh, thanks to this power, I'm going to create a perfect world.

Speaker 1:          06:20          So why do Glau cons, musings matter here? Because one of the key questions death note asks is what does justice mean when nobody's looking? This theme is repeated in light pseudonymity as Kira in l n ends nameless snus and in the anonymity of the cure supporters later in the show. And here's where the republic really comes in handy as a socratic dialogue. It's far less concerned with offering a theory of justice than it is with detailing. The process of exploring justice in its socrates and his frenemies use hypothetical scenarios and varying definitions to challenge what constitutes justice. Death note works in a similar way showing the movement and evolution of theories of justice between and within the characters. Many of the characters and death note Misa lights and Mika me to name a few believe that they possess true knowledge of justice and the tension between these characters and they're skeptics. Draw out the real meat of the show in one of the least subtle scenes, both El enlight declare in unison,

Speaker 4:          07:19          I am, I am.

Speaker 1:          07:23          Sentiment is repeated throughout the series, especially in the final episode or light claims that by reducing violent crime and ending wars he has become justice itself. Kinda has become law in the world. We now live. He's the one who's maintaining order. I have become justice and hear. Death note establishes itself as a kind of modern socratic dialogue using multiple participants to try and flesh out some universal question like what is justice? I'll the republic from the minute light proposes his vision of a new world. In episode one, I want the world to know of my existence that there's someone out there passing righteous judgment on the wicked. The question of justice is brought into play while he does struggle with himself for a second, might've passed judgment on others is the first real challenger is rebuke light sets out his plan to immediately kill off the worst criminals while letting the lesser ones dial,

Speaker 4:          08:18          and only then the world will start moving in the right direction. It'll be a new world free of injustice and populated by people who I've judged to be honest, kind and hard working. But if you did that, it would make you the only one bad person.

Speaker 1:          08:33          Rebuke is motivated by boredom rather than any sense of moral duty, but he notices the contradiction in lights argument beginning the socratic dialogue that lasts the rest of the show. There's no need to chronicle every moment of this series long philosophical inquiry, but there are definitely some highlights that show us the trajectory of this conversation. I've got a pretty good idea of what your motivation might be and I can guess what you hope to achieve. However, what you're doing right now is evil. I'm evil. I am justice. If this wasn't clear enough, this is where they end the episode by yelling, I am justice system. Make sure we get it and did we get it? Yup. Right? They both think they're justice. Lights likes to refer to himself as a martyr, even if it means sacrificing my own mind and soul, it's worth it. Which is pretty weird considering that he spends years trying to make himself the ruler of the entire world, but if you subscribe to his Kwassa utilitarian theory of justice that killing criminals and making one person, God will ensure peace and happiness for the greatest number of people, then he is sacrificing herself.

Speaker 1:          09:39          Knowing that becoming the god of the new world will mean becoming more and more Kira slowly killing light tiyaga me. It also means that in exchange for cleaning a rotten world, he would have to contend with a rotten self. Something that he acknowledges he had a probably knows that what he's doing is evil, but he'll try it. Change the world even as a martyr at the cost of his soul. That's his brand of justice. So this is lights, conception of justice. The world needs a Kira, and since he was chosen, he's willing to sacrifice himself in order to make that happen. His idea of justice is an old testament style bloodbath. We're sinners get punished, and blasphemy is the biggest sin of all. Did he mention the veritable monsoon of biblical imagery in this show? You know the churchy coral,

Speaker 5:          10:26          ah, this

Speaker 1:          10:30          ode to Michelangelo's the creation of Adam, the apples everywhere, l even washes lights feet since like spends most of the show acting is Kira. The distinction between the two may not be terribly important, but here it seems to represent lights, ideal version of justice, that the only true just world is one without criminals achieved by whatever means necessary. However else speaking as lind l Taylor highlights the contradictions in cure his reasoning. If a just world is one without criminality than the criminal act of killing people is also an injustice. This resembles rebukes rebuttal in episode one, but the differences that rebuke stops at the suggestion that light might be bad. While l offers a competing example not only as Kira unjust catching Kiera is itself an act of justice. The show stops short of telling us what Elva leaves justice is in order to believe that cure is violating it, but that's kind of how socratic dialogues work.

Speaker 1:          11:27          Poking holes and raising questions to get closer to the truth here imagines justice as a grand ideal. A world without criminals. L however only talks about justice as a reaction to injustice. A lot of characters believe in lights, ideal justice, but others seem to echo l philosopher John Rawls, much like a light and plato argues that in order to correct injustices in society, we first need to have an idea of what is roles and Plato disagree on a lot, but they both support ideal theory that when thinking about justice, we should first try to understand what it would look like in a perfect world where everyone did exactly the right thing. This is justice under ideal conditions, which for light and Mika me involve a lot of people being dead. However, others like philosopher Naomi Zack favor something called injustice theory. This approach does not rely on a preexisting ideal of justice and the perfect just society, but rather centers on identifying injustices where they occur.

Speaker 1:          12:29          It's much more practical to point to a case of injustice than it is to start from a broadly applicable definition of what is just by this measure. Only after injustice has been identified. Can Justice be applied to correct it. The L M N Alphabet soups hunt for Keira doesn't seem to be directed by a belief in a high in the sky definition of justice, but rather by the recognition that Kiros new world is unjust. Since we never get a clear sense of what else concept of justice is, it seems totally plausible that he sees justice as the response to injustice, so while light and those similar to him favor a Rawlsian approach of a world created around a perfect justice l is more focused on correcting injustices as they appear, any definition of the just becomes secondary. The struggle and resulting dialogue between these beliefs characterizes much of the philosophical method in the show.

Speaker 1:          13:23          Although other characters like Metsuda complicate the conversation and prevent it from being a split between just two ideas. That being said, we should briefly take a second look at our cake. Snuffing Sherlock Holmes, his code of Justice is a bit more ambiguous than lights, although it's very ambiguity, plays an important role. In many cases it appears that l and n as well as m are most interested in winning a game of wits. That game may be a symbolic battle between competing moralities or it could just be a case of some narcissistic geniuses obsessed with puzzles. Any of either case. This lack of any strong convictions about a positive meaning of justice serves at least one critical purpose. It means that El frequently plays the role of inquisitor, not so different from socrates in the republic. Another somewhat more surprising inquisitor is Matt Suda who raises sincere questions about the moral judgments of light. Kira, the Japanese police l just about everyone. Even at the same time as he is mocked for his inability to fall into line early in the season, he responds to El Speech on the childish morality of Cura by pointing out that violent crime in the area has decreased since Kira began killing.

Speaker 6:          14:30          Well, I'm not saying this to support to know or to condone the murders, but in the last few days throughout the world, but especially here in Japan, we've observed the dramatic decrease in the number of violent crimes committed.

Speaker 1:          14:43          He makes clear that he does not condone cure his vision or actions, but he's also skeptical of the hard line taken by l. Later in the series, he has an exchange with the other members of the task force that calls into question the very foundation of the squad, the belief in the inherent evilness of Kira.

Speaker 4:          15:00          Do you guys ever think that maybe cure isn't completely evil? What? What kind of question is that? Matsuda I've been thinking about it and part of me just doesn't believe that he is. So now you think Kira has justice too? I don't really know, but I think the kid is trying to fight evil and change the world in his own way and well the world's become a good place for people who live honest lives. So

Speaker 1:          15:24          pseudo with all his self doubt is both audience surrogate and philosophical foil to the other characters. Unlike light who is convinced of his own project, Lnn who are single mindedly obsessed with the task of catching him chief economy who is focused on finding the true Kira to clear his son's name and the rest of the task force who have all staked their lives and beliefs on the justice of ending Kiera once and for all. Matt Suda is constantly questioning the values that are presented to him as fact.

Speaker 4:          15:52          Hang on, am I the only one who sees something wrong? He can go around accusing people of being cute on, but the fact that he's wearing a mask says he's only trying to protect himself, not anyone else.

Speaker 1:          16:02          Matt suit. His demeanor is very different than the bravado of Plato's debate club boys. But he first and foremost recognizes his own ignorance

Speaker 4:          16:09          is, I mean no way

Speaker 1:          16:12          crucial for revealing the ignorance of those around him. Even at the end, as he kills light, he does so with questions rather than answers.

Speaker 4:          16:20          What was it all for the end. But what about your dad? What the hell did he die for? Bye.

Speaker 1:          16:25          Forcing the viewers and other characters to consider their own opinions of Justice Metsuda helps organize a jumble of competing ideas into a somewhat intelligible conversation. Matt Suda, the modern socrates as 10 years of fan forums demonstrate there's no real consensus on who best represented justice or whether lights new world justified the means, but that ambiguity is what makes the show so poignant. Death note isn't addicting, detective procedural, but it never abandons the original question of what makes a just world. And most importantly, it never gives us an answer. In episode 30 aptly named Justice Light pretty much sums it up.

Speaker 4:          17:05          If kitty gets caught, then that makes them evil. But if he wins in rules the world and I guess he's justice

Speaker 1:          17:10          by the end of the show, Kira is defeated and ends brand of justice seems to prevail, but it leaves us with a feeling that things might have been very different if Kira had survived the warehouse rather than giving us closure that l n n we're innately more Justin, Kira. This idea of winner gets all morality reveals at the war of competing moral codes was kind of a logic game, not a kind of truth seeking. You could argue that this makes justice totally meaningless for the world inside the show end might be justice, but for us the viewers, it's not quite so clear cut in regards to the meaning and implications of justice. Death note opens more doors. It closes in terms of whether or not socrates or rawls or Zach would find l or Kira to be paragons of justice. The short answer is definitely not.

Speaker 1:          17:58          Although there are some similarities that we didn't address in this video, like themes of tyranny and a focus on what it means to be a just city. The real connection between the justice of the Republic and justice in death. Note is not in their definitions but in their method and that method distinguishes death note as a show that does philosophy rather than just borrowing it. Thanks for watching guys piece.
