Speaker 1:          00:12          Greetings and welcome to earthlink cinema. I am your host. Garrick's were ameloid. This week's artifact is jaws directed by the wonder kid himself. Stephen wonder. The film follows police officer John Brody. The town's only lifeguard when a shark rocks a girl back and forth until she dies. He tries to close down the beach so it can't get to land, but the mayor's deepen the pocket of sustainable local business that crook, the mayor's plan works for five minutes until the shark eats chucky. Naturally, the town decides the safest solution is for everyone to just try and kill it themselves, but not quint, an actual shark hunter with a resume longer than his nails. Brody brings on a brilliant scientist named hooper who offers his professional opinion. It was a shark. The next day the fishermen catch dinner and the mayor opens the beach, but who bird calls bullshit. Since this sharks belly has an airtight alibi and said, you still got a hell of a fish out there on England day, some kids pull a hilarious prank while the shark pulls one of his own. Oh wait. And with no options left. The capitalist mayor is forced to hire quince and turn the town Communist. What follows is a human male getaway on a boat for the weekend full of fishing, drinking, and terrifying monologues about subtraction.

Speaker 2:          01:30          So 1100 men when they were 16 and come out of the sharks took the rest.

Speaker 1:          01:37          It's so fun. Even the shark can't stay away. And the trio try throwing barrels at it like it's Mario, even though its name is Dennis. They hook the shark, but their boat conveniently breaks down just like me. Anytime I watched the fault in our quarks, hooper tries to put it in a cage, but ends up getting in himself the goof while Quinn tries kicking it, remembering he's a policeman. Brody shoots Dennis until he explodes. Jaws Herald and the age of Hollywood blockbusters, which always got there do come award season. It's got everything a human with eyes could want from its merchandise tie-ins to it's complex to notes score to its high concept. Premise high because you have to be stoned to think of this for reasons unknown to our archeologists earthlings met this film with immense amounts of critical thoughts. Uh, first for the species through a Marxist Lens. Amities devastation can be viewed as retribution for capitalism, a disease that made humans rich. Well, a few of them early on. The film shows how the economic interests of amities business owners trump the needs of the common people.

Speaker 3:          02:45          I had a point of view and I think it speaks for many of the motel. How do you feel?

Speaker 1:          02:52          Even though the common folk can't count

Speaker 3:          02:55          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          02:57          the mayor refuses to band swimming. It would hurt the town's bottom line. While you've Brodie is similarly preoccupied with this rich dude sick house.

Speaker 4:          03:05          I know you got a lot of founders downtown, but I've got a couple of problems with the house or was she could take care of one. I've got some cats parking in front of the house. I can

Speaker 1:          03:14          lifeguard and handyman. Well doesn't this cop do, but ignoring the pleas of the common folk nearly ruins the town after Dennis, his reign of terror claims various humans, boats, horses and boat porches. The mayor finally allows brody hooper and quint to go kill the shark, even though they could have done it on their own at any time. This echoes marks belief that capitalism will ultimately be overthrown by the unhappy masses on a beach. This transition of power cures Amedee of its capitalist hangover so it can get back to drinking. At the same time, jaws can be viewed more broadly as a metaphor for corrupt government, also known as government. Indeed, the film offered American earthlings a way to vent their frustration with politicians in the wake of Watergate gate and this interpretation the mayor stands in for Nixon sharing his famous distrust for law enforcement or the fellas. Let's be reasonable, half his pension for covering up incriminating evidence.

Speaker 4:          04:09          What else could have done that to that girl? Bulk of ballet? Well, I think possibly, yes, call me over the phone

Speaker 1:          04:17          and his nautical themed suits when he's publicly disgraced. The audience experiences well-deserved relief just as the American people did when Nixon resigned from office to live on the moon. If psychology is more your cup of herb water, jaws can be read as a Freudian cautionary tale. It's all psychological. Freud posited, there were three sections to the human brain. The ID in charge of animal desires, the Super Ego, which controls morality and the Eggo, which balances a healthy breakfast. Dennis represents the primal desires of the ID, driven to consume things both figuratively and literally. The town and it's government or the Superego, imposing laws ostensibly for the greater good. And the Eggo is where these two forces meet, usually the shore. But here, the balance has broken down rather than finding the line between mindless consumption and moral snobbery, the aid runs wild baby. It's only when brody kills the shark that harmony corrine is restored, symbolized by him standing in a boat, half submerged in water, where he'll eventually drown. But the prevailing interpretation comes from filmmaker Stephen wonder who astutely proclaimed. It's a movie about a shark named Dennis for earthlink cinema.
