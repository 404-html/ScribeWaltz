Speaker 1:          00:03          Crack Jerod here today. We've got a favorite among the wise crack staff, the tale of humans picked for experimental augmentations to find out what happens when people stop being polite, start getting real at first. Look, the DSX franchise franchises, they kind of wet dream for info wars enthusiasts. Murderous clocks by the Illuminati are carried out by world governments while the player traverses fema camps and discovers the truth behind fake news, but unlike certain performance artists, dance sexist forays into conspiracy serve as more than just a means to sell dietary. So the game reveals how paranoia informs more of societies decisions than we'd like to admit and serves as a cautionary tale for the dangers of technology comp. But there are no gay frogs. Sorry, Internet, I don't like him putting chemicals in the water that turned the frigging frogs gay. Welcome to this wise crack condition on Dsx.

Speaker 1:          00:57          This video was made in collaboration with our buddy Joseph over at real life. Lord, you can learn more about his channel and check out his related video at the end of this one. And if you're here visiting from real life, Laura, welcome and be sure to subscribe, spoilers ahead for all the games. The day sx series asks two basic questions. One, what would it mean for society if we could all become cyborgs with Jack's arms and to what does the premise that every conspiracy theory is true mean for the real world? And before we get into the ethics of skull guns and neural enhancement, we have to put on our tinfoil hats. There is no shortage of conspiracy theories in the day, a sex series in the original game, a splinter organization of the Illuminati called majestic 12, produces a nan night virus called the gray debt as a means to consolidate their power.

Speaker 1:          01:43          Why contain it? Let it spill over into the schools and churches let the bodies pile up in the streets. In the end, they'll beg us to save them as producers of the only cure for the disease as well. They can easily manipulate others while capitalizing off the disorder. Wrought by it. The great death is a manmade virus. Everyone up to the president is at UNESCO's mercy, as long as you Naccho controls the supply. If Ambrosia in the cul invisible war, the illuminati controls two of the most influential groups in the world, the World Trade Organization and the order a religious organization opposed to the WTO. By managing the conflict between these two factions, the Illuminati is better able to control the world. Finally, in the new prequels, we see the illuminati attempt to limit human augmentation. Since having a bunch of engineered super humans running around isn't really great for the whole compliant population thing that they're going for.

Speaker 1:          02:35          If there's one thread that has run through the sometimes vastly different games in the series, it's paranoia. Not only is there the conspiracy, paranoia, but also paranoia directed at so called outsiders and others. Why don't you much greater going? Ultimately, the Games are fueled, the profound power of paranoia and that it doesn't matter whether the paranoia points to the truth or not. Paranoia, independent of truth shapes our actions and ultimately society. Early on in the game. Gunter, your sidebar, coworker, who yearns for a skull gun is convinced that the facility staff is replacing orange soda in the vending machines with lemon lime in an inane and unlikely conspiracy against him.

Speaker 2:          03:15          The machine will not make a mistake. It's still maintenance, man. He knows I like. Oh, so you think the staff has some kind of plot? Yes, to do that on purpose,

Speaker 1:          03:25          except 20 years later in the game sequel, it's revealed in the ruins of gunters office that he was right all along,

Speaker 3:          03:32          denying people their natural born rights to choose their own artificially flavored destiny's. Like I said, there's just something wrong with that machine.

Speaker 1:          03:40          Probably some sort of office politics as if to foreshadow the entire rest of the game. This idea of just because you're paranoid doesn't mean they're not. After you becomes the main ethos of Dsx in mankind. Divided colleague Spin Wild Tales of getting hacked, which turn out to be true. We have a lot of enemies. The people who bombed the train station, you don't think they'd love to know where we are. You need to help me figure out who's looking into us and make them stop other suspect, a police coverup of a bombing there probably destroying all the evidence there is right now. Also true and I was right. Even you, the player must navigate who to trust your old time boss David Saraf, pilot Alex Vega, your new boss that Interpol who may or may not be working for the Illuminati at every point. The game undermined your trust in others as you hack into the emails of your coworkers installed listening devices and get ambushed by enemies who were tipped off about your arrival hell.

Speaker 1:          04:37          Even the suicide cult that wants to merge with computers and mankind divided, turn out to only be a few years off from being right. JC Denton manages to do this with Helios at the end of the original day of sex. So why does sex make a point to validate even the most far fetched ideas? It could be in part a greater message about how paranoia works in the real world. People who are paranoid often don't invent things out of nothing, but instead take interpretive leaps when over analyzing the data presented to them or if you thought he was high strung before the attack only made him more manic. He's making connections. No one else sees some that may not be there, but rather than dismissing this kind of paranoia as mere delusion dsx runs with it is a man rambling in the sewers about mind control, right? Part of it, the hive mind inside the gate, I questioned what holds us together were unequivocally yes.

Speaker 1:          05:35          You mean your attempt to control people, amplifying your hypnotic techniques with some kind of social enhancer. This brings me to one of mankind. Divided is most important commentaries. Tracing the relationship between general paranoia and racial paranoia. Augmented humans as a metaphor for racial discrimination isn't exactly subtle as a mechanically augmented Interpol agent. You face harassments from the citizens of Prague and literally live on the wrong side of the tracks. As you witnessed routine police brutality inflicted on your augmented peers. Do you understand what fuels this discrimination? We're turning to cigar enthusiast and psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan, or at least with these liberty and Dumbledore, writes about him and forced flyboys. Jack are paranoid. Theories often reflect our own identities, ideologies and shortcomings rather than the actual state of things. For instance, he cites a story from Lacan regarding a jealous husband who even ever right that his wife is sleeping around, is still pathologically jealous.

Speaker 1:          06:34          If she stays late at work, he'll pathologically assume she's being unfaithful. If she starts having male friends. Same thing as a development of this logic. Gisha excites Nazi antisemitism. If a Jewish person committed a crime, it could very well be true, but the fixation on Jewish crime spoke more to German paranoia about foreigners in pure blood then to any kind of real issue. In other words, crime is just crime until a Jewish person commits it, then it becomes part of the Grand Jewish conspiracy to ruin the German race and so on. You can look at conspiracy theories in the same light are most laws made in closed door meetings with lobbyists and interest groups probably. Are they all part of a secret cult to serve their reptilian overlords? Probably not. Likewise, in Dsx and he augmentation advocates filter all information through the Lens that augmented people are dangerous and possibly an affront to nature, talking heads use terrorism, or the catastrophic August incident where augmented people were hacked into going into a homicidal rage to justify apartheid style oppression of augmented people. This discrimination then fuels even more violence, thus making augmented paranoia, a self fulfilling prophecy.

Speaker 4:          07:47          Everyone looking over their shoulder terrified. We're going to attack them again. Somebody probably will treat people like animals long enough. They'll start acting like animals.

Speaker 1:          07:55          The power of paranoia to shape public discourse can be seen in Dsx. Eliza [inaudible], defense of news coverage meant to spread. Fear toward the augmented is just reporting the news.

Speaker 2:          08:06          Let Ms Dot Kim. News outlets are simply reporting on the current situation

Speaker 1:          08:10          and even if the reporting is true for guest points out,

Speaker 2:          08:13          you can choose to only show my shoe, which is very ugly, but that is only a small part of me. News outlets only care about a small part. I'm sorry Ms Dot Dossen, but you can't trust the news outlets if you want to understand the world.

Speaker 1:          08:26          The Org debate in the news functions on two levels, one as aquin points out to only report on the negative aspects of augmented existence and to to use augmented violence as a validation for your larger ideological project in this case be human restoration act, a bill that would either remove or severely limit to the augmentations that people have of course on like real world news Pikus is news coverage is dictated by the Illuminati. I was engineered

Speaker 2:          08:56          to monitor communications and data streets to find out what people are talking about and make sure it's being discussed to correctly

Speaker 1:          09:03          as they cover up evidence of water contamination in Prague and falsely report that a flight was taken down by an augmented terrorist

Speaker 2:          09:10          in yet another terror attack. Two hundred and 51 passenger airlines flight

Speaker 1:          09:18          rather than the truth that the plane was shot down by a military installation

Speaker 2:          09:22          plane went down because of whatever the military was doing there. Not because of some augmented passenger like bike is. Clamps

Speaker 1:          09:28          are these paranoia is don't tell us much about reality itself, but instead shine light on the reality behind the paranoia for Dsx, that reality is a carefully constructed story meant to combat augmentation so that the Illuminati can better control the population for their pro business purposes, but is there an even deeper truth to the way paranoia operates in the game? While the real world is not governed by the Illuminati? Depending on who you ask, one could argue that it is governed by the basic principle, which the Illuminati in Dsx understands this state of exception. According to philosophers, Giorgio Agamben, there is a hidden law that why's behind both modern liberal democracies and the totalitarian regimes of the 20th century. The exception. We've talked about this before in our walking dead and attack on titan videos, but they, uh, sex is exploration is wholly unique. Accumbent builds off the theory of sometimes, right, but always an asshole.

Speaker 1:          10:21          Carl Schmitt who argued that would define sovereignty is not that the law per se, but the ability to suspend the law to make the exception for Gambon. This suspension of law marks all totalitarian regimes. The concentration camps were a physical space where normal law was suspended for more than a decade, a state of exception, whereas our modern liberal democracies aren't building death camps. The state of exception isn't always imminent component of modern governance, usually in the name of a national emergency or an existential threat. Governments today regularly create zones of exception where the law no longer applies or creates classes of people who are outside the normal functioning of the law and thus exist in this kind of exceptional state. Prisoners of war protected by international law get replaced by enemy combatants who gets sent to get mo were regular us. Law doesn't apply in DSX. This logic seems implicit to the conspiracy theory favorite fema in the name of managing emergencies.

Speaker 1:          11:20          They build detention camps for political prisoners and implement martial law, be segregated. Udall at complex of mankind divided presents a similar zone of exception in resembles a mix of apartheid era, South Africa, Jewish ghettos, Becau, luned, wall city and Modern Day refugee camps. The player witnesses horrifying examples of police brutality and augmented people who live in constant fear all in the name of security, and when tensions boiled over, such as when an augmented rights activist is assassinated, the civil unrest justifies even more if the illuminati wants to spread chaos like staging a train station bombing, it's because they understand that chaos breeds people desiring security, and when people desire security, it's all the easier to suspend basic rights and exert more authority. While we may think of chaos and order as opposites, the game understands how they can become entangled in the modern world. Chaos is manufactured in discreet ways in order for oppressive powers to maintain control, but besides illuminating, no pun intended, how security operates even in our own non illuminati world.

Speaker 1:          12:29          They esx also uses the state of exception as just one of its many criticisms of transhumanism. Transhumanism is the idea that technology will help us overcome human limitations like disease and scarcity, prosthetics, contact lenses, and in vitro fertilization or just stepping stones in the greater transhumans project. Transhumanism is baked into the very idea of human augmentation asx. However, rather than blindly celebrating, transhumanism, it portends everything that could possibly go wrong as the human race unlock human potential and mastery over nature that technology becomes available to individuals and groups and can potentially fall into the wrong hands. Even augmentation technology developed by the Illuminati soon escaped their control as private corporations entered the fray, this forced the Illuminati to change their stance and oppose augmentation. No, by going public with this discovery, Saraf is forcing our hand. Invisible war starts with a terrorist attack that turns everything into a grey goose and in mankind divided, there exists an underground market for augmentations which is likely assisting both the good guys and bad guys.

Speaker 1:          13:41          As such, the destructive potential of technology often necessitates permanent states of emergencies and martial law. That accumbens work was critical of basically, as technology gets to epic, the government will have little problem convincing you that your rights have to be suspended for the good of everyone, but it's not just the state of exception that's a problem for the transhumanist future. JBS Haldane, one of the earliest thinkers of transhumanism warrant in 1924 that society would have a hard time keeping pace with the progress of technology in data lists or science in the future. He wrote that the tendency of applied science is to magnify injustices until they become to intolerable to be born and the average man who all of the profits and poets could not move turns at last and extinguishes the evil at its source. In other words, technology will make social injustice is worse until societal anger will boil over into a full on rage in Dsx.

Speaker 1:          14:38          More often than not, the dangers of technology are thrust upon the poor. Those who are augmented need to constantly take neuropazine to stop their body from rejecting their augmentations, but those with means can much more easily obtained the drug. And in the case of manual laborers or soldiers who are augmented by their employers, let me guess. Most of the laborers will mentored with heavy duty industrial rings or the government sends you what they want, do what they want, replace parts of you whenever and however they want. They exist in a precarious state where the maintenance of their augmentations is contingent on them maintaining the same or similar job rather than suggesting that human evolution through technology will level the playing field they isx suggests societal forces will make inequality worse and just as Haldane warns that this tension will cause people to rise up and root out evil at its source.

Speaker 1:          15:29          We see two competing movements in the game focused on the same thing in human revolution. The humanity front uses violence to stop the spread of augmentation and and mankind divided. A legal solution exists in the human restoration act. Meanwhile, augmented people slowly entertained violence as a political strategy and tell the assassination of Taylor's rucker results in full on riot, you know, would have rutgers death is going to spread, don't you? When that happens, the head of state police assures me Golem city will become a war zone. Another idea trumpeted by some transhumanists is the idea of the singularity. A point at which artificial intelligence will explode the rate of technological development in the original dsx. Bob Page hopes to create his own twisted version of this by merging with the Helios Ai, but instead the player is given the option to merge with Helio's to rule the posts singularity world as a benevolent dictator,

Speaker 5:          16:27          trenches.

Speaker 1:          16:31          The game doesn't necessarily put any kind of judgment on this, but the solution still feels a bit icky and afterwards when the merger between JC tensen and Helio's doesn't go as planned, the technological infrastructure of the world collapses and chaos envelops the world gc that's going black. The message is not so subtly found in the name of the two ais that usher in the singularity Daedalus and ICARUS

Speaker 5:          17:02          and barriers between her falling.

Speaker 1:          17:07          According to legend Daedalus was an ancient Greek inventor who invented manmade flight. His son ICARUS plummets to his death after using the invention to fly too close to the sun. The collapse can be viewed in this light as a too fast and too reckless technological development that comes metaphorically crashing down. Just don't know what you're doing. Everything when they lost everything, the world would fall to pieces. Haldane believed. The only hope is for morality to keep pace with science dsx explores the moral questions inherent in our technology driven future isn't right for companies to augment their workers. Instead of asking this beforehand, the prevailing logic and the game is augment. First ask questions later. What about installing chips to limit a person's augmentation? If they say go on a homicidal rage. A brief debate may happen on TV while legislators are trying to pass the bill, but companies have already developed the technology before anyone decides whether this technology should even exist.

Speaker 1:          18:08          Technology first, morality later, and that's a recipe for disaster in a way to Nsx is forcing us to ask these questions. We can find tailless rucker offering a robust criticism of government's limiting the abilities of the augmented and even though we're a bit far from Jack's arms, the Games can make us question the technological progress in our own world. Usually I would get a lot of press in for a knee, but given that these social media has radically redefined how we engage with the world and we've only begun to ask questions about its influenced after we suspect it's done something egregiously wrong. So what do you think wise crack will arch like dsx convinced us to take a critical look at technology before we decided to universally adopted? Or are we diving headfirst into a nightmare? And one more question. In a world where people trying to succeed in places like Texas, Catalonia, and even California seems to be getting more popular. The original dsx seems weirdly prophetic. There's the national secessionist forces and Texas is troubled attempt to leave the union, but how would that actually work? Our friend Joseph at real life floor has a great video exploring the hypothetical secession of Texas where he and I are from. So go check out his video by clicking here and be sure to tell them that wise crack sent you. And as always, guys, thanks for watching. Peace.
