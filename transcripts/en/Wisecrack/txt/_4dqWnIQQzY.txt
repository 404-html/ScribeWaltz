Speaker 1:          00:07          Conventional wisdom or has had at the, we have no teper source of electricity, then call and impact the have no reliable suffers. And part of the reason we have that belief system is because environmental as have generally pushed when power and for the world tykes which can be a small percentage, five, 10, 15, maybe even 20% of our electricity supply and that makes them huge markets. But 10, 15, 20% of our supply is not a climate change solution. There are great investment opportunities and we invest in them, but we have to be clear they want solve the climate change problem for that you need something that can have the kind of reliability, independent ability call has. You can sign a 20 year contract with the utility and say something other than I'll ship your power when the wind blows. It doesn't quite work for utility.

Speaker 1:          01:04          Uh, there are newer technologies coming along that solve that problem. Do your terminal solves that problem. You can deliver power when the utility needs new kinds of technologies like solar thermal and Florida just announced, uh, the use of those technologies for a massive solar project in Florida, not considered a traditional solar strength state. These technologies can have what's called dispatchable power. When the utilities customers need power, you can supply it to the utility so they can supply it to their customers and not make excuses like it's not sunny or the wind doesn't blow. And that kind of utility grade power, power, I call it punk power is absolutely key to cracking call. Not only that, it has to be cheap enough. Fortunately, the cost of coal based power has been going up. Environmental Regulations for criteria pollutants like sulfur dioxide in mode creating have been getting more stringent.

Speaker 1:          02:05          And because of that call now it costs quite a lot more to preger coal based power costs a lot more to produce than it did five years ago or even two years ago. Uh, that gives us an opportunity. The coal industry is talking about next generation coal power plant technology called IGCC and IGCC carbon sequestration is what they think is the solution. The so called clean called switch. That solution should be attempted. We should try it. My personal belief is solar thermal technologies and geothermal technologies will be cheaper than those technologies. And because they will be cheaper, they'll beat them in the marketplace. And we will, uh, find, uh, that we don't need as much coal for power generation. There are other good uses for calls, so I'm not against cove, but it shouldn't end up in our atmosphere first. You know, I believe having watched technology development over the last three to five years, that could a, the biggest problem is having people believe that we can replace oil with a cheaper alternative. That we can replace IGCC corn plants with a cheaper source of power that are more renewable, 100% renewable. Having the world believe that is, I think the biggest problem. We still need to make more progress in technology, but I do believe it's a mostly solved problems.
