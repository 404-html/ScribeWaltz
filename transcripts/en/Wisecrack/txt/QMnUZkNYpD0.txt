Speaker 1:          00:07          This week on thought those, we bring it all the boys to the yard, but the glass Menagerie by Tennessee Williams, my main narrator, tom gives us the low down that everything we about to people on this stage is a memory of his dad. His Dad, he skipped town a long time ago, leaving his Mama, Amanda and her sister Laura cashed out on the struggle, so now tom got to be the breadwinner is grubbing time and wingfield crib where Amanda like Laura, keep that as tight to make sure the boys were highland mama bugging that lower going to be single forever, but Lord don't expect any browsers to show up one to woo her and since she got a busted ass foot and always acting all shy and Amanda started running her mouth about how she was so fine back in the day that she had 17 busters and one afternoon trying to get a crack at that ghetto booty.

Speaker 1:          01:04          Amanda say she could've bagged a rich playboy, but she chose that scrub ass daddy. Instead. Later Lord making show her glass collection shines. When Mama gets all tears saying why you ain't been going to that school, I paid for it. Apparently Laura been ducking out and walking around birdhouses and Amanda about had it with you like girl. Has there ever been a brother you wanted a piece of that was this fly player named Jim back in high school who used to call me blue roses, but jim was to happen and to kick it with Laura. A couple months later, a man again Tom's grill. When he snapped and say, woman, stop riding my nuts trying to control me. I'm the one bringing home the bread tom piece out to the movies, but mama say he probably doing something scandalous, grabbed the car which and bails. Next morning Tom Apologizes for being a dick and said he go to the movies because he jonesing for a life of adventure.

Speaker 1:          02:04          Mama say, boy, you better get your head out of your ass. We got to make plans for Laura Hooker. Robber one of them warehouse boys you work with. So later, Tom, tell his momma he got to do name O'connor dropping by. Amanda loses trying to prep and Tom say chill. He doesn't even know about lower. I mean real talk. She crippled and spent all day with her glass animals. Next night, tom started talking about that boy Jim, who used to have the hots for dude was bawling. Man. He had mad whose skills was the president of every damn club and can even drive some ill rhymes. Bang. Show them changed because now he grinding away at the same broke ass job as time a man. That stuff's lower. Brossa them titties looking fine. Then she dropped the big news that cat dropping by his Jim Laura wigs out so hard that when the boys arrived, Loyola Chokes and got a dip out to another room.

Speaker 1:          03:01          Damn Law Jim and Tom to compensate by the White House apparently about the get the poop, but he already got plans to join the merchant. Siemens young. Matter of fact, he signed up using a chat if he was opposed to pay the electric bill with Amanda buses in Jabber and again about how all the brothers wanted her back then and it's all sipping and child with till Bam. The lights go out, he's bought some candles and a man to tell Jim to pull up a glass of wine for Loehr. Jim stopped throwing game that Laura calling her old fashioned type of girl and said he never noticed her Janki legs back in high school. Laura talking about school and her glass collection. When Jill said, girl, you so fly, you don't even know it. You just need some confidence. Boom, the Laura show him her favorite thing, a glass Unicorn.

Speaker 1:          03:55          Jim, here's somebody dropping some fresh beets nearby. So we ask Lord a dance. They bring it on the dance floor. When crash, that Unicorn gets busted, rather beg, and he got to build her confidence. So he kissed her, but then immediately recognizes he dumb dumb because turns out he getting married next month. Damn Laura gives him the broken unicorn as a souvenir. Ge thinks when a man that comes in, just say, Yo gotta bounce. I'm engaged. Thanks for the dinner and Unicorn though, Amanda just about ourselves and starts getting crunk on time. Say He made them look like fools. Bring her home and engaged. Man. He ain't nothing but a selfish asshole who's head is always in the cloud. Thompson's doses out of that trap to get his adventure on, but no matter how far you go, you always thinking of his post system.

Speaker 1:          04:53          There's a play as a choice example of what my boys, he will cause plastic bed and then the pet gang. Everything on stage, I'm talking props, sounds, music, lighting, wrapping the phase that's gone on inside the character's domes and then the glass menagerie. All that mess is showing how the feel family's dreams ain't jiving with reality. Remember, this crew got some fantasy world that they live in La, spend her days chilling with her glass Menagerie, creating a place where she ain't got to deal with all of them real life. Ask Her mom, always dogging her, not being shy, bugging out at school. I could go on and play up at Williams getting on his plastic theater jam. Describe the reality of Laura's situation by comparing her to that glass. Just peaked the stage direction. Be a fragile unearthly. Prettiness has come out and Laura, she is like a piece of translucent glass.

Speaker 1:          05:50          Touch by light, given a momentary radiant, not actionable, mad last, but that glass collection ain't the only thing. Wrapping Laura, Laura recall blue roses because she is a blue rose. She mad sensitive, always feeling blue and got a unique kind of beauty that you don't usually find in the hood that busy Amanda always living in the past when she was a sexy southern Belle who could get any brother with just one work. Now she a single mom who got burned by some little bitch and is now living a bleak ass life. That disparity between life in her mind and life on a real, making her act like a damn fool like when her ugly ass was wearing a dress made for some young hoochies Tom Dream about writing and living an adventurous lifestyle since grinding at the warehouses Halloween boy talk smack to his mama and even boost cash from the family just to add flavor to his own game even though he peaced out to live the high life.

Speaker 1:          06:49          Surprise. Surprise. Sometimes your dreams get on by reality. Boys do to become just as bunk as his pads. I was pursued by something all at once. My sister touches my shoulder. I turn around and look into her eyes. Oh, Laura, Laura. I tried to leave you behind me, but I am more faithful than I intended to be. Jim was top dog in high school, but now he had low level scrub busting his ass at a warehouse, but even he living in a world of Bush saying he taken public speaking courses that's going to shoot him to the top boy please. The only way these cats can escape the prison of their real lives is the lot of themselves over and over until it sticks t we'll slang and repetition all up in his tax. To make that point, Amanda always talking about some flower called John quills to bring her back to the good old days of attendance and rich on dogs.

Speaker 1:          07:45          Our so lovely that country and may literally flooded with John quills. That was the summer I had the craze for John Quinones. John quinones became an absolute obsession. Mother said, honey, there's no more room for John Quills, and I still kept on bringing in more John quills whenever, wherever I saw him, I said, stop, stop. I said, John Quilts. I made. The young men helped me gather the John quills. It was a joke. Amanda, her, John Quills. Finally, there were no more advisors to hold them. Every available space was filled with John quills town. Keep dropping the words movies and move the shelly itching to escape this type of flow as a special kind of repetition called Politiken when you repeat, whereas they got the same routes. Yes, movies. Look at them. You know what happens? People go to the movies instead of moving. I'm tired of the movies and I am about to move.

Speaker 1:          08:40          Man. This show do suck a fat one. When you recognize that your life ain't going to never be the fantasy in your head. The hard truth is that for the Amandas Toms and lawyers of the world, sometimes there ain't nothing better you can do than pull to the side and escape the cloud.
