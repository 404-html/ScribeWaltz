Speaker 1:          00:03          What's up wise, crack jared, eternally trapped in your computer here. Self-Aware humor is all around us. Deadpool cabin in the woods and even galaxy quest are all well loved and it's easy to see why they make fun of the very genres they inhabit and they're all part of a growing trend of media that makes fun of well itself be a superhero.

Speaker 2:          00:23          Listen, the day I decided to become a crime fighting swindler who rooms with a bunch of other little whiners at the Neverland mansion of some creepy old bald heaven's gate looking mother. On that day, I'll send your shiny happy as a friend request

Speaker 1:          00:39          and since this trend isn't going away anytime soon, we thought we'd give you a little primer on the complex nature of self criticism. So in order to gain elevated insight on how we get on the world around us, let's explore the ever so important distinction between satire and parody. Both satire and parody exists to criticize the world and hey, that's like my number one favorite thing to do, but like all things, there's a lot of bad satire and bad parody today. We're going to figure out the heart of what each is with two wisecrack, crack, faves, watchman, and one punch man. So join us as we dive deep into the nuances of their respective genres so that we can appreciate these amazing properties, even more. This wisecrack condition on parody and satire with watchman and one punch man. And as always, spoilers ahead and we'll be using images from the watchman movie and the graphic novel.

Speaker 1:          01:29          So please don't freak out. But before we get into it, want to give a quick shout out to alliance heroes of the spire who enabled us to make this video today.

Speaker 1:          02:10          Let's start with a refresher course in alphabetical order. One Punch man follows cytoma a hero capable of defeating any enemy in a single punch. On the flip side, we've got watchman, a story that asks the question, what if superheroes were just people like us? Which is to say, before we get into categorizing, let's talk about what these stories have in common. Most clear is their willingness to take the archetypes of their respective genres and twist them around. One Punch man takes an animate trope like magical girls. I'll off sailor moon and distorts it with a swole ex convict. There's also the familiar hardworking every man hero, but he's just a De buffed version of Toku hero common writer. And of course we have a Goku s world's savior, but he looks like a low rent Halloween costume attached to an egg. On the watchman side, we've got an army of Superhero knockoffs.

Speaker 1:          03:00          Both roar shack and Ozymandias are distillations of certain elements of Batman. Ozymandias says the charismatic, rich and hyper intelligent Bruce Wayne. The force of good that the world needs clean cuts and above the fray. Roar Shack, on the other hand, is the detective Batman fighting crime and searching for truth with a capital t, much like the world's greatest detective [inaudible] shacks, quest for truth and justice fears dangerously close to a horrifying obsession. He's like the ugly version of Frank Miller's take on the Cape Crusader and for good measure, there's night owl, a recreation of the nerdy inventor version of Batman, Allah, Adam West, and his shark repellent. Both stories use these twisted up versions of recognizable characters to make observations about what we take for granted and supercrew stories. The types of heroes we see, what we expect them to do, and what we think motivates them to shoot. Oh, you know, 10 of them done by changing up what we're used to.

Speaker 1:          03:58          The departure from the original tropes sticks out like a sore thumb. In both stories, this contrast explores what we'll call a more realistic version of superhero power. What is having God like power really like to find out? Let's turn to a pair of hairless wonders site Toma and Doctor Manhattan. While a pair of galactically powerful heroes isn't exactly the kind of thing you'd see in real life, they're reaction to power very much is both Cytoma and doctor Manhattan confront the boredom afforded by omnipotence site to must spends his time mourning his lack of a true challenge. While doctor Manhattan mostly has weird sex, hangs out on Mars and contemplates the nature of time despite their vast power, neither is a traditional protagonist like that man or Goku because neither one struggles in a traditional way. While Goku has to train with King Kai and sprint along passages between worlds. Cytoma just does some pushups. Batman puts together clues to solve mysteries. Doctor Manhattan literally knows everything and Community Jack

Speaker 3:          05:03          wants me to look into my future. See if the colors that were publicly identified,

Speaker 1:          05:07          where do you see the stories about good guys overcoming the odds, but for site and doctor Manhattan, physical confrontations are over before they start. Doctor Manhattan one the Vietnam War by himself and cite them up, beat up an alien that searched entire galaxies for a worthy adversary without ever even giving it his full effort.

Speaker 4:          05:27          Well done. [inaudible] Motor, the hung a tote on Oca.

Speaker 1:          05:34          So what is the one critical difference between the method of one punch man and watchman? Watchman is a satire and one punch man is a parody. While one is ultimately an adoration of the genre, it lovingly pokes fun at the other is a burn it all approach. So the heroes who used to cover our jammies according to satire, a critical reintroduction by Dustin Griffin, org of is designed to attack vice or folly. It seeks to persuade an audience that something or someone is reprehensible or ridiculous. When it takes over another literary structure, it tends not to just borrow it, but to subvert it or direct its energies toward alien ends. Watchmen as a satire doesn't just attack the vices and follow these up society and the superhero genre. It's specifically assaults, the idea of anyone possessing powers that even approach that of a nuclear weapon. It's largely about nuclear fear only this time, it's not just directed at a bomb, but a blue skinned super being John Osterman becomes doctor Manhattan in a nuclear accident, ease then recruited and used as a weapon to win the Vietnam War.

Speaker 1:          06:41          Even his name is eight far from subtle reference to the Manhattan project. He's fascinated by both time and clocks and throughout watchman. We often see clocks counting down toward undesirable outcomes. In the graphic novel, this is even clearer. Nuclear security is referenced all the time and fear of nukes drives many kinds of conflict. The Vietnam War was a response to fear of nuke wielding Russians, riots and violence on the home front in opposition to superheroes all returned to the fear of a nuclear threat symbolized by blue skin space wizard, doctor Manhattan, the Ussr and USA need a fabricated attack on earth to even set aside their differences, exposing the extreme lengths taken and casualties sustained just to de escalate the nuclear standoff. Watchman shows the dangers of power, but also it's indifference. Doctor Manhattan gets bored of everything and in his boredom becomes increasingly conflicted about the nature of existence.

Speaker 5:          07:37          I prefer this. Don't let here

Speaker 6:          07:40          [inaudible]

Speaker 5:          07:40          I am tired of earth. He's people. I'm tired of being caught in the tangle of their lives.

Speaker 1:          07:48          It's ultimately a grim joke about superman. If he were really an all powerful being, why would he worry about humanity?

Speaker 7:          07:55          In my opinion, the existence of life is a highly over right. This phenomenon,

Speaker 1:          08:02          it's even clear in his sartorial choices. Superman rocks his costume to evoke the American values of truth, justice, and the American way. While doctor Manhattan strips himself of ideology and gets naked, watchmen makes a more explicit point about the corrupting influence of power with the comedian. Superhero stories ask us to believe that the good guys with power are the ones who deserve it, but watchman is more than willing to point out that they're not. The comedian is a hero in the mold of Captain America or Wolverine and extra strong, intelligent, hyper capable super soldier, but he's also a sadist psychopath. Watchman isn't just making these observations to satisfy your brain's thinky parts. It uses the form of the superhero genre like Batman clones and all powerful beings and the content of the story, the try and persuade an audience, but persuade them of what you might ask.

Speaker 1:          08:55          Well, there's certainly the problem of nukes, but Griffin also says that satire wants to prove that something or someone is reprehensible or ridiculous, and in this case, that's something is the very idea of superheroes. Watchman is dedicated to making the case that the very existence of superheroes is a dangerous fantasy. You can compare it to a classic work of satire. Jonathan Swift's a modest proposal where the author suggests solving famine by eating children, of course, which wasn't actually pro kid eating. He was just trying to show the failure of society in his time and did so by inhabiting the form of a political essay that overtly exhibits the indifference to suffering, that characterize those in power. Just as swift use the form of a political essay to make the people who write to political essays look like heartless monsters. Watchmen uses the form of a superhero narrative to make superheroes look dangerous and it posits that superheroes create an asymmetry of power that defies regulations.

Speaker 1:          09:54          Superheros can violate the rules and commit acts of violence at their own discretion, even if they have everybody's best interests at heart. That degree of power inevitably becomes dangerous as different ethical frames allow roar shack and Ozzie Mandy has come into conflict, whether it be super powers or nuclear powers, that degree of power will inevitably lead to some ups. Watchman can make these arguments so effectively because it uses the structure of superhero stories to make its argument. Like Griffin says, when it takes over another literary structure, it tends not just to borrow it, but to subvert it and direct its energies toward alien ends. Every inch of watchman is dedicated to turning the traits we love about superheros against themselves. And the end of the day, watchman condemned superhero fiction as a genre because it promotes a dangerous fantasy. But site to mum might want a word about that. There's no doubt that one punch man is poking fun at superheroes of both Manga and western comics as well as the genres themselves. The villains in one punch man, give intentionally over the top versions of classic villain monologue.

Speaker 8:          11:04          No, no. We beat up on them. But to know, I mean that will pull the hallway on the wheel. Somebody [inaudible] you say [inaudible] [inaudible] every

Speaker 1:          11:18          character has a dramatic backstory. Coy got cool. What ain't no causal connection and a fighting spirit. It uses anime and Manga tropes like ocean creatures, swarms of people in suits, hydro style monsters and more. It's always in conversation with other works in the same genre, but without the judgment we see in watchman. Why? Because one punch man isn't a satire. It's a parody. Now let's investigate the difference and I promise it's more than just semantics. We've already seen how satire has a specific persuasive function usually in opposition to something, but parody isn't quite like that. Parody exaggerate certain elements of its target, but it ultimately affirms the literary form it in habits to be more specific. Worsening to Robert videon and his essay are parody and deconstruction secretly the same thing. Parody excepts the logic and rules of its genre and takes them seriously as tools of its criticism.

Speaker 1:          12:20          As Finian says, it operates from inside of the texts and ideas it criticizes. Think of how Genoese mirrors a classic animate protagonist. He suffered a trauma and is trying to become strong enough to get revenge for the people he loves, but at every turn he's rendered a joke by site. Tim has immense power that doesn't diminish Genoese. His appeal, we can still relate to his desires and they aren't treated as stupid. They're just irrelevant because cytoma has thrown all the rules out of whack. All the things we mentioned before, the tropes references, even the structures of character arcs and stories are all classic Monga. There's no doubt one punch man's creators truly love the genre, but don't think it's above ridicule. The show makes this argument by exaggerating the overpowered hero archetype in many Manga anime and even western comics, no matter how powerful the villain gets, the hero gets stronger to match.

Speaker 1:          13:13          Take Goku for instance, enemies get stronger and stronger, but Goku is always able to save the day. Usually through some intense training regimen. Dragonball z celebrates this, but one punch man asks why there are you and other characters. Jenn Osen, Moomin writer, much like crillon or Yom Tra train hard to match their stronger friend, but they never can and honestly don't need to. The real hero will always be there to save the day by turning anime and Manga on their heads to make these points. One Punch man is critiquing superhero stories by showing precisely where they double and collapse for a great example of where the lessons of superhero stories collapse. Let's get back to Moomin writer. He has a classic backstory and grows motivation.

Speaker 1:          14:00          Well, mind you touch him. He just wants to help people and be like the heroes. He looks up to Suny choosen. He knew God, not unlike Memoria for my hero academia and much like Muh Doria before he gets his powers. Moomin writer constantly gets his ass kicked. It's a message about real life. Some people just don't have what it takes to be a superhero and telling everyone they can might get them seriously hurt. We can see the same intrusion of reality and Cytoma. Most superhero stories end with the hero. Happy to be saving the world and waiting for the next challenge. Site to Ma has a more relatable reaction. Boredom, there's nothing to overcome and that leaves you without a reason to get out of the bathtub. This may sound like the satire rules so far, but instead of trying to show something as reprehensible or ridiculous, the crucial point for parody is that the body of words is always pre loved and redirected.

Speaker 1:          14:52          Parody is used to awaken us to the flaws and the things we love, but not to demolish a flawed genre like watchmen aspires to do with superheroes. One Punch man makes clear it's mocking, animate to help expand the possibilities of what it can do. It's a complicated relationship mocking the things you love. It can be hard to tell how to approach a parotic text, but according to fit in, if we read parody straight as sincere expression without relating it to a structure of criticism, we misunderstand it. That's the key. Parody is a tool for criticism, but that criticism operates on the assumption that the genre it's criticizing is worth improving. One Punch man calls on us to get away from the bigger monster, bigger gun and find other stories to tell stories about chefs, ice skaters, and even Mahjong players opening up the possibilities of anime.

Speaker 1:          15:40          Storytelling is a noble goal and one that is sorely needed. The ending of the show amounts to criticism of the dragon ball z model of storytelling. Much like Goku. Boreaus is constantly seeking the strongest opponents in the universe, but unlike our say in hero, he's willing to destroy innocence to find the ones he wants at the same time site to match the actual strongest being his board of all the power one punch man is displaying both ways. This infinite power model can fail. Now, it's important to remember that one punch man may criticize a certain kind of superhero narrative, but it doesn't disavow the value of heroes. The show wants us to recognize and emulate the bravery we see from Genoese and Moomin writer, but also recognize the silliness of the story. We find those lessons in. That's the critical difference between one punch man and watchman.

Speaker 1:          16:28          Both use, they're overpowered characters to make points about the genre they inhabit, but watchman makes condemnations of all sorts of social systems beyond the context of superheroes and even condemned the superhero genre itself. One Punch man feels different. There's a general agreement that the stories we've told forever need a little refresh, but that doesn't mean abandoning them completely. With that in mind, we can label things like Chemo America, Dr Strangelove, and heather's as satire alongside watchman and Deadpool, galaxy quest and blazing saddles as parody alongside one punch man. And the Big Bang theory is none of these things because that show, and as always, thanks for watching guys. Nice.
