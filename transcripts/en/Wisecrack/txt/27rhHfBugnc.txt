Speaker 1:          00:04          Yes,

Speaker 2:          00:07          track jared here today were dawning our trench coats as we talk about what went wrong with the final installment of the rather tragic Matrix trilogy, the Matrix revolutions. We could talk about the flat characters, unclear motivations and structural cluster, but perhaps the most important thing to address is the fact that, well, the movie just doesn't make much sense or to put it more generously. It has some colossal narrative gaps. We basically can't make sense of the plot without some pretty massive interpretive leads. Here are our top three burning questions. One, how the hell does neil have powers outside the matrix to? Does Neil make his own choices or is he just a pawn of larger forces? And three, is neil supposed to be Jesus again, and how does this religious imagery fit into the story given how much thought went into these films? It can't be that the witch house, he's just dropped the narrative.

Speaker 2:          01:00          Ballz oily, right? So if the answer is don't lie in the narrative, perhaps they lie in the philosophies that inspired the film's, woken with his wife's cry condition on the Matrix revolutions, what went wrong, and of course spoilers ahead in case you don't read. Watch the trilogy every few weeks. Here's a recap in the matrix. Neo wakes up from a simulated reality to discover machines control the world, and he is the one prophesized to save humans from their metal photos, digital ass kicking in suits in reloaded. These dreams are dashed when we discovered that neos not special, the prophecy was part of the machine scheme. All the log and the film ends with him gaining insane powers, but also in a coma. In revolutions, neo awakes from his coma and cooperates with the machines to beat agent Smith and a fight to the death saving humans and maybe machines from lives of servitude. So how does neo have power in the real world? The only explanation in the film were given is this.

Speaker 3:          01:57          Tell me how I separated my mind from my body without checking it. Tell me how I stopped for sentinels. My thinking. Tell me just what the hell is happening to me? The power extends beyond this world all the way back to where it came from, where the source, and that's great you felt when you touch those sentence

Speaker 2:          02:19          and then in the end of the Matrix video game, we get

Speaker 3:          02:22          touched. The source separated. It's mine.

Speaker 2:          02:28          These are basically non explanations since they don't, you know, actually explain anything. There are also fan theories. Maybe there's a matrix within a matrix or maybe Neil's wirelessly connected to the source. Dial up is very nineties, but none of these are really textually supported. Instead we think these mysterious powers have something to do with French philosophers. John Beaudry, art in the Matrix, the witch house keys referenced boatyards several times.

Speaker 3:          02:53          Welcome to the desert, the real,

Speaker 2:          02:58          the desert of the characterizes beaudry arts critique of the postmodern era where meaning and reality are replaced by ear representations for Baudrillard. The term similar locker described signs that have no relation to the real but pretend to like a painting that looks like a polaroid photo of a Unicorn on instagram. When these fake copies without originals get together, they form simulations, and when simulations hookup, they replace reality. With the virtual, the web of media we're plugged into all day. What's worse? There's no easy exit from the virtual. You can't tell it isn't real, because who even remembers what reality is when the virtual becomes more real than reality itself. We enter hyperreality where technologies and simulations control meaning not humans like a desert wasteland. Reality is emptied of meaning for humans. The problem is the witch house keys took this a bit, but literally they show technology that controls meaning by literally enslaving humans.

Speaker 2:          04:00          Meanwhile, the real is a literal desert or more like more door meets Manhattan, and the Matrix is not just simulated ideas and technologies, but a physical network into which humans are literally plugged. Even bogart himself criticized the witch house skis saying they took the hypothesis of the virtual for an irrefutable fact and transformed it into a visible phantasm, but it is precisely that we can no longer employ categories of the real in order to discuss the characteristics of the virtual. That's French for they've done for Baudrillard. There are no red pills and blue pills or external reference points from which you can distinguish the real from the fake if you could. One could easily choose the real as neo and others do, so laying one final bit of smack boatyard insisted. What would be interesting is to show what happens when these two worlds collide.

Speaker 2:          04:51          It seems the which house keys not only took boatyards words to heart, they plotted a pretty wild course correction in the sequels. They attempt to merge the real and the virtual by giving neo powers. In the quote real world, we start the trilogy thinking of Neo as real and the matrix and its programs as fake, but as the matrix revolution seems to imply were wrong. Neo doesn't just plug into the virtual, he can't unplug from it. The virtual is inside of him. When he kills the sentinels or experiences the train station in a coma, we see a more complex idea of the virtual that is not the opposite of the real, but a layer of the real or interwoven and confused with it that neocon tap into. This may also explain how Smith entered the real world. When Smith clones himself onto Bain, the real becomes virtual, the virtual becomes real, and the distinction between mind and body collapses.

Speaker 2:          05:46          This idea of the real world as virtual can also explain why neo can see the world as energy pulses as if it's a virtual. Here, the witch house keys borrow from the old archetype of the blind seer. Someone who through seeing less actually understands more odin even plucked out his own eye to gain knowledge, although it's probably not what boatyard had in mind. Neil's blindness helps him literally see a fundamental truth about the relationship between the real and the virtual, namely that they aren't as separate as he thought. Finally, Baudrillard helps explain what's happening in that train station. The weird limbo space between the real and the virtual. Here neo discovers programs who want to escape the so called real world where they're forced to carry out their programming and attempt to hide in the matrix from the perspective of humans, the Matrix as a deceptive false space that steals their agency, but for the programs, the matrix is a liberatory space where they can be their true selves. If you're a digital entity, maybe the virtual world is the real world. This is perhaps why at the very end, the Oracle is ambiguous in her plea to the architect.

Speaker 4:          06:55          What about the others? What others come on and say, I'm fiercely. They will be freed.

Speaker 2:          07:02          Is she referring to the humans or machines? Could be both, but for the machines getting out might mean getting in and for the humans, vice versa. This brings us to the conflict between choice and determinism, which if you remember from our matrix reloaded video, they never shut up about

Speaker 4:          07:18          causality. Action, reaction, cause and effect. Everything begins with choice. No wrong.

Speaker 2:          07:29          Inevitable is literally the last word neo ever speak.

Speaker 5:          07:32          That's right,

Speaker 2:          07:38          right after he says,

Speaker 5:          07:42          yeah,

Speaker 2:          07:43          wait, choose what to keep fighting something else. Be Clear, man, and whatever choice he refers to isn't even up to neo or AC, just the product of larger fates and factors. How does this fit in with the oracles apparent omniscience? Is it some mutation in his programming or purpose that drives agent Smith to start a clone war? Is it chance or does he reveal that programs have the capacity for choice and free will? Let's see if we can use some philosophy of free will, determinism and fatalism to make sense of this show. Most of us experience ourselves as making choices. We write geeky videos on Friday nights because like neo week shoes to and not because we don't have friends for aristotle. This is because humans are rational animals. Our reason helps us to make choices and differentiates us from other animals and technology to call something a choice.

Speaker 2:          08:35          One must be able to act otherwise and not be driven by mere instinct or programming, and most of us probably agree with David Hume, that the ability to act or not act according to our own desires and reason is the basis of human freedom. Neo morpheus and the rest of the gang certainly agree and they're cheesed off because humans are being treated well like machines with their minds and bodies totally controlled while plugged into the matrix. They don't seem to have the capacity to act otherwise, and of course the arc of the whole series bends toward gaining freedom, but of course it's not that simple. Neo and friends don't realize that freedom of choice is actually part of the matrix itself. In perhaps the most cryptic conversation in cinema history, the architect reveals earlier versions of the Matrix didn't work because even though the world was perfect for humans, they were being forced

Speaker 4:          09:26          choice. Choice,

Speaker 2:          09:30          but choice is so essential. Humans value to it even over perfect happiness.

Speaker 1:          09:35          Do you know that the first matrix was designed to be a perfect human, the world or suffered every. Everyone would be happy and it was a disaster. No one would accept the program. Entire crops were lost.

Speaker 2:          09:52          The current matrix only works because it accounts for the human need to choose. I'll be at a paradoxical choice to give up their freedom.

Speaker 4:          09:59          As I was saying, she stumbled upon a solution whereby nearly 99 percent of all tests subjects accepted the program as long as they were given a choice, even if they were only aware of the choice at an unconscious level.

Speaker 2:          10:09          Hey, wait, doesn't this look similar to boatyards claim that we prefer and willingly give up control of meaning to the virtual? Yes, it does. Gerrit. Anyway, this produces anomalies in the heart of the system. Neo and his five predecessors. Human choice means there are some aspects of the architect's plan that can't be predicted. Enter Neil, who chooses to save trinity instead of reloading the Matrix, freewill one, determinism zero, but does neo really make a choice? There are several reasons to wonder. First it looks like neo chooses to give. The architects play a big middle finger and runoff the safe trinity, but for Aristotle and Aquinas, the passions like love, anger, jealousy, or the Kryptonite of choice and free will. They're no more than animal impulses. The architect also isn't buying it. Maybe it's because he doesn't understand choice.

Speaker 1:          10:59          You and I may not be able to see beyond our own choices, but that man can't see past any choice

Speaker 2:          11:05          or it's because he thinks neos returned to trinity is just the result of another causal law. Love

Speaker 4:          11:10          already I can see the chain reaction, the chemical precursors that signal the onset of an emotion signed specifically to overwhelm logic and reason

Speaker 2:          11:20          or as a wise crack favorite puts it what people call love. It's just a chemical reaction to compels animals to breed. It's possible that neos just responding to basic evolutionary programming, what the architect refers to as a chemical reaction. Colonel Sanders incarnate believed that everything is mechanistic. The matrix fellow programs and even humans don't have choice but operate unphysical, logical and mathematical laws of causation. This version of determinism dates back to ancient philosophers like Democritus, loose ipis and others you might confuse for diseases who began noting the physical was not random, but governed by strict causal laws. Determinist buzz kills that. They are always claimed the appearance of choice is just part of the system. Once the architect notices the human need to at least feel like they're making choices, even though they'd be plugged in like so many light brights, no matter what, he just adds choice to his determinist calculations.

Speaker 2:          12:14          Then the whole function of the one is to control the narrative of choice and resistance in a way that suits the machines. They're stuck in a cycle. Every time you think you're escaping the system. Nope. Xy on rises. The one appears. He meets the architect. The one chooses most. Everyone dies. The Matrix reloads xy on the one weird conversation, choice death, reload, rinse and repeat until neo, but even if we buy, but it's love with a capital l, not just chemicals that made him exit door number two or do whatever he's referring to here. There are still reasons to be suspicious that it was ancient human choice for medieval theologian and 40 year old Virgin Thomas Aquinas choices. Not Enough. It's our freewill that makes us sensitive to which goals are best or most moral and allows us to be held responsible for our choices is neos will free.

Speaker 2:          13:08          Well, one very powerful old lady and something called fatalism makes that unlikely and don't worry about fatalism is like determinism with a heaping spoonful of the supernatural. Let's focused on physical laws, fatalist claim events are destined to occur because the gods, the fate, or even our own character and compulsion's directly caused them to and if by gods they mean a bearded math program, a cookie baking profit and a self replicating Lord l Ron, then we're inclined to agree over the course of the films, the Oracle's been very busy. She's the one behind the prophecy and if we're to believe the prophecy is just a mechanization to met out the anomaly and guide him to the source, then that would mean she's tricking neo and his pals into almost every one of their decisions. Even when she pretends it's his choice through a fatalist lens. It almost seems like she and the architect are pulling all the strings and the whole series is just a game of chess between the two of them made a very dangerous game. Then again, the witch house keys leave us wondering, does the Oracle really make her own choices or is she just a product of fate and determinism to by aristotle and Aquinas is definitions. It seems she does make choices. I made a choice and that choice, she makes the choice to save Sati and let agent Smith turned her into a clown, but she also says she made these choices to fulfill her purpose. What's your purpose to balance? She also says they had to happen to happen. I'm sure it couldn't be here like you remember

Speaker 3:          14:52          me, but it wasn't meant to be

Speaker 2:          14:54          so maybe she isn't making choices, so if neo isn't making his own choices and the oracle might not be either than is anyone. This movie is freaking impossible. Maybe agent Smith, as his name suggests, is the only real being with agency in the film. When he's killed by neo, he refuses to return to the source to be destroyed. I knew the route,

Speaker 5:          15:14          so I understood what I was supposed.

Speaker 2:          15:18          It's a choice similar to the one neo makes, right? No, by his own account. Smith as a diehard fatalist and he doesn't see this as a matter of will, but part of a grander plan.

Speaker 5:          15:29          We're not here because we're here because we're not free. There's no skipping, no denying purpose, because as we both know without purpose, we would not exist

Speaker 2:          15:43          and he's pretty sure his purpose is still to kill neo. Ultimately. Agent Smith believes freedom. Truth, peace and love are just illusions and fantasies as meaningless as the matrix itself.

Speaker 6:          15:56          There's a freedom or peace but love illusions. Mr Anderson, vagaries of perception, temporary constructs of a feeble human intellect, trying just Berkeley to justify an existence that is without meaning or purpose in all of them as artificial as the matrix.

Speaker 2:          16:16          Really programming and fate are real and because they're not programmed, human lives are empty, but just when determinism and fate appear to have kicked us out of choice, we're reminded that will for freedom. Peace and love means something for both humans and programs.

Speaker 3:          16:32          I love my doctor very much. I just have never program speak of see human emotion now, etc. But methods is the connection. The word implies

Speaker 2:          16:46          love. It is not just an illusion or some chemical Bs. It's a powerful and meaningful connection and so his freedom or the freedom to do otherwise sati doesn't have a purpose.

Speaker 3:          16:57          I find it to be the most beautiful thing I've ever seen, like where we are from. that is not enough. Every program that is created must have a purpose. If it does not, it is deleted,

Speaker 2:          17:09          but her life is still worth living and she should be free to live it. Neo realizes that just as humans can exercise their freewill, some programs can't either. Maybe This is what makes neo realize that it isn't just humanity that needs saving from this war. If we really want to talk about choice, there must be choice for everyone. Then again, before we can put our neck braces away, we're in for more whiplash because it's the oracle who sent sati and her family here at this exact time for this revelation about freedom,

Speaker 3:          17:37          what choice to help you to guy neil

Speaker 2:          17:41          high and it makes it again seem like she's controlling everything. After all thIs and all the films chit chat about choice. It's not that neo or anyone else for that matter actually makes one. If nobody is making choices, that is neil, even the real protagonist. Is it the oracle? Are we even supposed to care as if there aren't enough unexplained plot points? Revolutions ends with some confusing religious imagery. What exactly is this glowing jacked in jesus supposed to show us? Maybe we can explain this in terms of choice versus fate, but also faith from the beginning. Neo is a quasi religious figure who helps save humans from their ignorance and enslavement in the matrix. He's basically straight out of the gnostic gospels which talk about a savior who is the ultimate guide to the nature of reality. This group of religious, mostly christian heretics in the early ce claimed that humans perceive the material world in darkness, sleep night and blindness and must be saved through waking knowledge, light, etc. Sound familiar? Neil basically spends half the trilogy just waking up. When neo sacrIfices himself, he enables true knowledge of reality and peace between machines and humans, but it's not determinism that gets him this far. It's faith. He has faith in his purpose and in the possibility of peace even when he doesn't have a clue what he's doing,

Speaker 5:          19:04          but beyond that, I don't know

Speaker 2:          19:08          even the faith of the other characters play a big role in turning the tide of the war.

Speaker 5:          19:17          So

Speaker 2:          19:18          while we can't explain how neo raises the dead or how the blind can see, that kind of seems like part of the point. Maybe the religious imagery is the last word on the whole determinism business. Some things exist beyond reason. Clarity or calculations, maybe part of what makes us human is this capacity for faith in peace, in goodness, and something beyond ourselves. So far, we've tried to fill some plot holes by exploring the witch house keys, philosophy, faves, but perhaps the answer to our question has been lying in a small detail all along. The oracles earrings. Maybe many of the inexplicably happenings in revolutions are there to prove some sort of uni and yankee point that it's not about winning, but balance. the philosophy of yin and yang found in taoism and confucianism is present in the films, not only in jewelry, but in themes like balance cycles and dichotomies.

Speaker 2:          20:10          According to chinese philosopher joe, he yin represents a dark condensing force and is associated with metal fire and the material world. Yang is associated with light expanding forces, water, earth, ci or energy forces in life flows. Notice that in revolutions the real world is full of machines and bodies and is literally dark and on fire while the virtual world is of the mind or things are light and well not on fire, but getting yang are not dichotomies. they stand for opposite, but connected forces like a light and dark side of the same hill. So why do asian smith, neo both have unexplained powers and obsess over each other because they are yin and yang, light and dark sides of the same anomaly.

Speaker 3:          20:55          what is he? He's. You could be so good. The equation trying to balance itself out

Speaker 2:          21:05          instead of confusing the real and the virtual allah baudrillard, yin and yang, help explain how the real and the virtual are two sides of the same coin and both are important for achieving peace between machines and humans. Was neo making his own choices or was he determined by larger fates like the architect and the oracle who are also a bit uni and yaggie we'll never really know, but in revolutions, choice and fate are a bit yin and yang. Equally important aspects of the human experience. Is the matrix really a religious allegory bringing credence to the prophecy or did the oracle make the whole thing up to win a game of wits against the architect? Again, we'll never know, but maybe that's deliberate. Both faith and faith are important aspects of making meaning for programs and humans, and maybe we're being too meta here, but it seems revolutions even combines eastern and western philosophy as two important parts of the philosophical story. So to summarIze what went wrong? Well, we've spent over 20 minutes philosophizing about these films and still have no idea what exactly happened, but maybe that's the point. The film seems committed to being beyond sense. If they told us everything or flawlessly implemented each philosophy, wouldn't they just undermine their whole point at some things are beyond reasoning calculation and that's okay. Or maybe we're giving the which house keys. Too much credit. Either way, despite their flaws, we won't be unplugging from these stories time soon.
