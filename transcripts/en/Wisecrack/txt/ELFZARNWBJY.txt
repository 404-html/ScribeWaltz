Speaker 1:          00:00          This video is sponsored by blue apron a wise crack. Jared here today we're talking about the show that launched a thousand Halloween costumes. Stranger things, pretty much every 20 something with a borrowed Netflix password is losing their mind over season two but why is everyone so obsessed with a show that's basically the goonies meet Fox mulder, some may Pinot on the stall chip, but I'm going to argue it has a lot to do with toys, whether it's kids becoming the rulers of a nation by engaging in literal warfare or an animated baby in a suit doing espionage, TV and movies about powerful children tend to age them up in order to demonstrate their abilities rather than taking seriously. The potential of childhood. Childhood is either something to be overcome or just comic juxtaposition against their adult roles. What makes stranger things unique is that the kids win by being kit rather than by growing up or pretending to be adults.

Speaker 1:          01:00          By paying attention to the way stranger things in Birch that convention and shows the inherent power of children, we can perhaps better understand why the series resonates so much for millennials. Being a kid at heart doesn't mean you're regressing. Sometimes it means being a total bad ass. Welcome. This wisecrack addition on stranger things and as always spoilers ahead if you need to get caught up. Here's a quick rundown on the first season, a decade before the start of the show, a secret government funded experiment kidnaps a girl names her 11 and it makes her use her psychic powers to spy on the Soviets and whoops, summon a demon hell beast from another dimension. This piece of tax, a boy named will and brings him back to, it's really depressing home dimension, which is just like earth except the atmosphere is full of Kleenex pieces and everything is kind of dam wills.

Speaker 1:          01:45          Three best friends, Dustin Lucas and Mike set out on a quest to find him once 11 escapes or creepy fake dad. She joins the junior rescue crew and the rest as they say is eight hours of quality television, 80s and 90s kid nostalgia certainly helped give rise to the popularity of the show, but that nostalgia extends far beyond the reach of Netflix. We also see a certain longing for the past in the current millennial obsession with toys witnessed the insane popularity of Funko pop figurines, hoverboards and subscription boxes filled with everything from star wars pillows to Batman themed ramen bowls, toys as a symbol express lightheartedness and innocence, but they're also an important means for rational and emotional connection. Toddlers learn about the world through their toys. Children use toys to share or fight with friends and to act out the possibilities of the future. Despite this many popular depictions of toys trivialize their role, labeled them as immature and their popularity has given rise to dozens of really think pieces on how millennials need to grow up.

Speaker 1:          02:43          Stranger things takes toys seriously. They're not only an essential part of the storyline there, the foundation on which the rest of the story is built. The quintessential example of this is the way that the language of dungeons and dragons is used to make sense of events both for our plucky gang of four and for the viewers themselves. We were thinking of more of an able to mention like do they look shadows when we first meet the boys in episode one there in Mike's basement playing d and, d, The demo gorgon monster is first shown is a figurine in their campaign and so when they meet the interdimensional monster later on, they talk about it in terms of a monster they are familiar with.

Speaker 2:          03:16          This is one of my, the demagoguery with your wrist rocket. I took art to do to go into fight darth vader.

Speaker 1:          03:21          The same is true of the alternate dimension. The Monster hails from as 11 tries to explain what this place is. Nobody understands until she takes the campaign board and flips it upside down to represent an alternate and parallel side to our own reality. Since those concepts are fundamental to making sense of the paranormal element in the boys' lives there also fundamental to the viewer. We really have no way to understand or express the upside down or the Demo Gordon, except through the language of d and d. That board and that figurine shaped the mythology for the entire series. We see the same kind of language framing in Dustin's constant references to comic books and Star Wars.

Speaker 3:          03:59          Do you think 11 was born with her powers like the x men or do you think he acquired them like like Greenland here

Speaker 1:          04:05          to ham? 11 is one of the x men and the chief is Lando Kalryzian. When the boys think he's setting them up,

Speaker 2:          04:12          what were the chief set us up, Nancy, maybe Lado Corinthian. Would you shut up about Lando?

Speaker 1:          04:19          Dustin knows that Jean Grey has telekinesis, so 11 similar powers don't seem impossible. His relationship to games and toys and cartoons gives him and the other children the ability to understand. It's powerful.

Speaker 3:          04:32          What does, this is Hawkins. This is the robos.

Speaker 1:          04:38          In contrast. Joy sees evidence of the paranormal and it pretty much destroys her because she has no way to communicate this knowledge to the other adults or even herself

Speaker 2:          04:47          is after him. He said danger. We have to find,

Speaker 1:          04:51          everyone thinks she's cuckoo for cocoa puffs because they simply don't have the right frame of reference to make sense of the events except for Mr. Clark. His connection to childhood toys and Games makes him an understanding ally who entertains the idea of an upside down well before the other adults. You know, that'll shadows echo of the material plane where necrotic and shadow magic. Exactly the significance of toys goes beyond just making sense of the Eggo. Snuffing demi goddess in the basement on one level, stranger things gives credibility to toys by showing that they have the potential to be powerful. When Lucas suggest bringing his wrist rocket on their adventures, even his friends make fun of him. You're going to take out the demo Gorgon with a slingshot, and it's true that in the end, the wrist rocket gets literally beaten to the Punch by 11 psychic attack on the demo.

Speaker 1:          05:35          Gorgon. This may seem like it detracts from our argument, but the mere fact that the wrist rocket was part of the fight shows that it can't be easily dismissed successfully or not. That slingshot, that toy fought a monster from another dimension in the world of stranger things, toys become objects of great utility. Nancy's costume chest provides 11 the ability to move around comfortably in public. She can go to school, meet adults, and navigate the world more easily after she plays dress up without the new found confidence provided by the dress and the blonde wig. 11 wouldn't have found will on the heat hit radio or saved Mike from the class bullies. She has super powers, but a dress up bin did something that esp couldn't. We can also see the utility of toys and will's homeaway from home castle buyers. It's a kid's fort built in the backyard, but it probably saves his life when he's in the upside down.

Speaker 1:          06:23          Not only does it shelter him from the Demo Gorgon, at least for a little while. It's also somewhat implied that the sense of familiarity and comfort provided by the Fort helps to keep him alive in the toxic atmosphere. Perhaps one of the most obvious examples is the scene where Joyce and 11 pulled together a makeshift sensory deprivation tank so that our girl Elle can go dimension hopping. They go to a school and Philip, a Kiddie pool that was once used to bob for apples. This scenario despite the participation of the adults is so laden with kid fueled ingenuity that it's almost over the top, but it's that kitty pool that makes it possible for 11 to discover barbs body. Sometimes the role of toys in the show, it's a little less blatant. You might've forgotten the scenes were 11 practices, her powers on the Millennium Falcon figurine or when we'll get an Atari for Christmas at the end of the first season, definitely an Atari and Atari by making toys.

Speaker 1:          07:13          A constant presence in the show. Stranger things emphasizes their omnipresence and importance in the lives of children. The significance of toys isn't always limited to the kids either. There are also a few occasions where toys are important tools for teens and adults. Joyce's alphabet light display looks an awful lot like a wiki board. Nancy and Jonathan basically recreate home alone to catch a monster and top it off with a smiley face. Yoyo. Jonathan's very fancy camera is referred to as his toy was have to take away his toy. Please got the camera and it's key to documenting the existence of the demic organ by first producing another toy, a puzzle. These examples all point to the same idea. The Times when the teens and adults are most successful at fighting the enemy or understanding the world are when they adopt the conventions of kids. This isn't just children having power.

Speaker 1:          08:00          It's the power of childhood itself. We can see an interesting presentation of this idea. In the case of the walkie talkies and the campuses used in the show, radios and campuses are not inherently toys. They're primarily used for adults for distinctly uncoil like purposes, but in stranger things. They are toys used by the boys as a form of play prior to taking on their strategic roles. The walkie talkies are vital for communication during the search for will and the magnetic misdirection of the campuses leads the gang to the conclusion that the portal is inside the Department of Energy Facility, but we don't see the adults using them to similar effect. The police have radios, but they never hold the same kind of power or usefulness as the toy radios belonging to the kids. So stranger things takes toys seriously because it takes childhood itself seriously. The kids don't save the day despite being kids.

Speaker 1:          08:48          They save the day because they were kids. This doesn't mean that everyone loving the show wishes they were actually 10 years. Again, I wouldn't deal with troy and his elk for all the fun dips in the world, but stranger things fights back against the idea that being a kid or liking toys is some sort of deficiency. There isn't just nostalgia in remembering childhood. There's power to, so what does it mean to give toys? This kind of influence by empowering childhood is stranger things. Fanning the flames of our nostalgia driven culture. Is it fighting against that by making childhood into something more than an ironic tee shirt?
