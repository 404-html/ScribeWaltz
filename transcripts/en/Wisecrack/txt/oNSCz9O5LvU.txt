Speaker 1:          00:30          greetings and welcome to earthlink cinema. I am your host, Garrick's wormy Lloyd. This week's artifact is the Truman show, starring stand up, turned, impressionist turned comedic, actor turned dramatic actor, turned comedic, actor turned nihilist. There's no meaning dynamics slim carry. The film follows lovable human male Truman, burbank who knows a thing or two about sensible sweaters. What he doesn't know is that he's actually on a reality show because who needs writers line his town was a movie set. His town is a movie set and keeping with Hollywood tradition. Everyone is fake. Freaking up. This freak show is tortured artist, khristopher tortured because he wears a bra to ensure truman doesn't get any crazy ideas like swimming. He makes Truman's dad drink too much. Flash forward to the college years season where Truman falls for a sexy librarian, actress, and after some flirtatious running, she tells him those three little words every guy wants to hear.

Speaker 1:          01:28          Everything's alive before Truman can say, yeah, I love you too. Production intervenes and whisks her away to the h, two o company Fiji inconsolable beyond words. Truman marries the next person he sees, but Truman can't get her out of his hand, so khristopher tries. Bird Manningham. Then it only makes things worse. I'm not really sure how it could have helped. Truman starts noticing that his dead dad looks a lot like the town's only homeless guy and more alarmingly that someone has canceled his Sirius xm before you can say blah, blah, blah. He Truman skipping town until Khristopher pulls the old. There's been a nuclear explosion, so this one road is closed trick and like all my family road trips, it ends in divorce. So Truman does his best Saddam impression and hides when the network can't find him. They start a human hunt cut transmission and air reruns of technical difficulties.

Speaker 1:          02:23          Khristopher loses a ship, but immediately finds Truman on it. He makes it rain if you catch my drift. Since HBO still holds the rights to violent death, they stopped the storm and Truman breaks the fourth wall. Truman tries to punch his way through for a hot sec, but gives up and goes for the fire exit instead, but khristopher has another trick up his sleeve, namely a Samsung Galaxy note. He fires up the PA system that's been there the whole time. I can hear you and asks Truman back for six more seasons in a movie, but Truman's agents are sharks and that's just the nature of the Biz. The Truman show begs the question, to what extent are recovered by some unseen, all powerful force, otherwise known as Disney's the force for Truman. It's the latter. A state referred to as the illogical determinism, but why you got to put a label on things. Every aspect of Truman's life, from what he eats and where's is controlled by Khristopher. In fact, Christopher's name is a variation on Christ as in Jesus Christ. Yeah. Christ. Through most of the film, Truman struggles to free himself from the system and make his own choices,

Speaker 1:          03:34          only to find offers flashmob poised and ready to dance. The film frames this age old debate in a 20th century context, when most human lives were controlled by the media, instead of the chips inside their brains, Truman is literally owned by a studio well until the right to revert back to marvel has last name. Burbank is a nod to the California and city where the Warner Bros used to do keg stands. As we watch truman get ushered from product to product by subtle advertising. We can't help but notice the same attempts by the media to groom our decisions. That is a beer, not that I would ever tell you to buy. Kill Mo's eyebrow wax on sale. Now for 6,000 Garba trons. I just wouldn't. Truman's journey to discover the truth resembles the thought experiment, the allegory of the cave by plate. Oh, Spaghetti. The experiment imagines humans chained to a wall only knowing shadows, more popularly known as a sex dungeon.

Speaker 1:          04:28          Truman's worldview is similarly constrained, is cave is sea haven. The actors are his shadows and his hair is just perfect. Plato's oppose that. Once a prisoner ditched the cave, he would prefer the outside world to the dark. Khristopher disagrees, I think what distresses you said, ultimately Truman prefers his cell, but as the film climaxes Truman calls him a liar, liar. His perseverance to retire from Showbiz is reminiscent of Captain Ahab's classic struggle with moby penis symbolically representing the struggle between mankind and God, the novel ends and a good old fashion drowning, whereas Truman's ends and breathing the final frames suggests that humans had the will to control their own destiny, which was true until president and Kylie Jenner found out about it. Birth link cinema. I'm Garrick's Romeo void and in case I don't see you. Good afternoon, good solstice and didn't
