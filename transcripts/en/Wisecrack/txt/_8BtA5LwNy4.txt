Speaker 1:          00:09          We buy things for wildly different reasons. We buy things because they satisfy basic needs like hunger or thirst. Uh, we, we buy products because they make us feel good. They meet our needs of identity or, or needs of belonging, right? On some level though we buy everything because it meets some needs that we have. And I think companies have kind of gotten a shy about the reasons why people buy their products. The biggest myth I have heard in corporate America is the myth of the low interest category. You'll go into a company that makes widgets and they'll say, oh, well it's a relatively low interest category. It's something that people aren't that interested in. And so, well, our biggest, you know, our only choice is to just slice it down and make it as cheaply as possible. I don't think that's true. I don't think there is any such thing as a low interest category.

Speaker 1:          00:59          Every time we go in. And, you know, we study cleaning products when we find out that it's really about a mom caring for her children and we study, um, soft drinks and we realize it's much more about kind of feeling like you have a sense of identity and belonging with, you know, with a group of people. Um, we study in engineering thermal plastics and we discover that it's really about chemical engineers who use those thermoplastics feeling like they're competent in their job. There's always a human being in a high interest factor associated with it. I, I've told more than one, uh, you know, ceo that the first thing he needed to do was to walk around his company and ask people, do you think we have a low interest product? Okay, you're fired. Right? And get rid of people who don't believe that the stuff that you may can change the world because it is changing the world whether they're noticing
