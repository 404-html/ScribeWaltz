Speaker 1:          00:08          Hey, why is cracked jared again? Today we're talking about an insanely popular Halloween horror series guaranteed to make you barf up all your candy corn. No, not the Emoji movie we're talking saw since 2004. The torture porn he franchise has been locking up morally dubious characters in all kinds of gruesome steel contraptions and inventing creative new places to hide the keys. The creepy puppet master of the saw franchise is Jigsaw and boy does he love playing games, and by playing games we mean locking unconscious people inside Dank warehouses and giving them 60 seconds to choose between certain death self mutilation or if they're lucky, this embellishing a stranger. When people talk about saw, they tend to focus on jigsaws impressive body counts, but just as you can pick through a pit of heroin syringes to find the hidden key, you can sift through this villains deadly traps to find the grander meaning of his game. Welcome this wisecrack edition on the philosophy of Saul, and as always spoilers ahead. The philosophy of saw all comes down to jigsaws. Motivation is torturous. Games are opportunities for his victims to repent for their sins and ostensibly to transform into better human beings.

Speaker 1:          01:23          They survive his tests and the odds are not quite ever in their favor. He believes they'll emerge with a new found ability to appreciate life. So basically if Tony Robbins had a baby with Satan, in a sense, jigsaw embodies a kind of extremist Christian morality. But before we get there, we first needed to get into the headspace of John Kramer. Alias the jigsaw killer. Once upon a time, John was a perfectly nice civil engineer who loved hanging out with his pregnant wife, Jill, who owned a drug Rehab Clinic. Then one of Joel's tweaked out patients, Cecil Adam's robs her clinic accidentally injuring Jill in the process. She suffers a miscarriage and John Falls into a deep depression. A short while after he's diagnosed with a brain tumor and terminal cancer, he plummets further into depression and its relationship with jill quickly deteriorates.

Speaker 2:          02:16          Girl boy, boy, girl, boy gets cold, pregnant girl loses baby boy, turns into a serial killer

Speaker 1:          02:26          and instead of joining tinder or something, Joe continues to entangle herself and her booze drama. After an all around year, John Tries to kill himself by driving off a cliff. Miraculously, he survived the crash and emerges totally sure of his new calling, dispensing morality, one torture device at a time. It's a moment that I decided to end my life, started me and my work and brought meaning to it, and I was determined to spend the rest of my days testing the fabric of human nature as John cooked up a fresh coat of morality to match his new mission in life. He seems to have been inspired by an unlikely source early Christian philosophy. Specifically, it's views on suffering. According to early Christian tradition, God is good in everything he created is good, and nobody really questioned that until one day and an early Christian stubbed his toe and discovered suffering and was like, this sucks, WTF God.

Speaker 1:          03:17          Once a bunch of Christian theologians started stubbing their toes, they realized they needed to rationalize how an all good God could have created such suffering. They theorized that suffering had to be the fault of no good, lousy humans. Here's what they figured. When Adam ate that apple from the tree of knowledge does committing the original sin. He's separated dumb, evil humans from the pure perfect God who apparently doesn't like it. When humans eat a fresh healthy snack from then on, sinful humans would need to suffer and repent if they wanted to be reunited with God. Suffering then is the result of our own sins and an expression of the pain. We feel over our separation from God in this way. Traditional Christianity justified suffering as the fault of the sinner, not of God. Crisis averted. Similarly, Jigsaw thinks his victims deserve the suffering that they endure in his traps. He helpfully reminds each victim of the sins they've committed to get there and he doesn't hold back.

Speaker 1:          04:17          As Jigsaw sees at his victims are enslaved by their past and morality, not his industrial strength, torture devices. Much like theologians believe humanity had been trapped by Adam and Eve's original sin fittingly. The saw series has a few atoms of its own. In sophomore we learned that drug addicts, Cecil Adams, is responsible for Jill's miscarriage. His original sin is a catalyst for John's transformation into jigsaw. Additionally, in the first film Adam stand height, a photographer who spends his day spying on people becomes one of jigsaws targets. His professional quest for CD knowledge mirrors that of Adam's desire to eat from the tree, so Kramer's view on human suffering shares a similar origin story to that have early Christians, which hey could mean that watching some movies qualifies as attending church. However, John Kramer also shares a common thread with Christian theorist and father of existentialism, Soren Kierkegaard, who sees suffering as a critical part of personal and spiritual growth.

Speaker 1:          05:15          For context, much like Kramer Kicker Guard had his share of luck. He had a lifelong physical deformity. He watched his mother, brothers and sisters die at a young age. It became totally convinced that he was going to die at age 33 light Kramer. He also broke up with the love of his life, his then fiance regime, yet continue to pine after her for the rest of his days. Basically the two of them could have shared stories over whiskey. They also both believe that suffering purifies the sufferer, teaches them to appreciate life and forces them to take responsibility for their actions. You might prefer your life without a generous dose of suffering, but here are the guy out here regard, believed that an individual must pass through three distinct phases to become his or her true self. First, the aesthetic driven by central pleasures and lacking any morality. Seconds, the ethical driven by morality and belief in individual responsibility and third, the religious driven by faith in God. So how do you go from being a lowly drunk aesthete to an upstanding ethical guy? Well, you can always try out one of jigsaws torture machines. That's right. According to Kierkegaard, suffering is key to moving up to the next stage of human development. Here could guard was mostly talking about spiritual and existential suffering, not being caught in a torture device or worse. Having people spoiled game of thrones

Speaker 1:          06:33          still jigsaws machines can be understood as a test for each of his victims who are typically aesthetes driven by desires for sex, drugs, or money. His testes present his victims with an ethical quandary that usually forced them to make a painful decision. This matches the way cuter guard explains the journey from being an aesthetic to ethical being first, the ethical life makes the suffer, suffer even more than before. Drawing him out of the frying pan and into the fire so that he really has something to scream about and only then does it help him, but how exactly does suffering help you become more ethical? According to Kierkegaard, suffering forces a human to reflect on their situation. If only to think, oh, this sucks, that moment of reflection summons the first doubt, which regard describes as the thought? Why is this happening to me? Can it not be otherwise? Or to put more simply what's going on? That little WTF moment generates the immediate desire to change your circumstance. Desire opens a person up to a character guard, calls ethical self. Understanding suffering is growth inducing because it turns these single individual over to himself completely at its most successful. This suffering can force a person to repent for past sins, take responsibility for his guilt and choose to seek his own survival, but more on that later as you progress up the ladder of development, a piece of your old false self dies, much like the old Taylor swift

Speaker 1:          08:06          because she's dead. Judging from his own interpretation of his car crash, John Kramer agrees that a different person crawled out of the wreckage. For Kierkegaard, the ultimate goal of spiritual suffering is to completely kill off your flawed false self in order to make room for your recreation it into a better truer self. Kramer demands this of his most fervent follower, Amanda, when she agrees to live by his ethical code,

Speaker 2:          08:30          every cell in your body, there is no turning back.

Speaker 1:          08:40          Amanda sits in a prayer like position listening deeply. Diehard Saul fans called is seen Amanda's baptism, which is fitting when you consider how baptism relates to suffering, just as Jesus rose from the dead to redeem humanity. Human beings are baptized and spiritually cleanse Christian tradition. Also see suffering as a mechanism for spiritual cleansing. Jigsaw frequently references this concept of rebirth, whether he's chatting with his favorite disciple or welcoming a new victim into one of his traps.

Speaker 2:          09:12          Welcome to your rebirth tonight. I give you the opportunity to face your upside.

Speaker 1:          09:18          Jigsaw even loses his kidnapping Virgin v during a literal celebration of rebirth, the Chinese New Year celebration because it's the year of the pig. Kramer even picks up his sweet trademark pig mask at the event. Trigger guard and Jigsaw have a few other important ideas and common specifically. They both value personal responsibility. Kierkegaard writes that the first indispensable step of becoming a real man isn't getting strange new body hair, but by becoming a responsible individual before God, Kramer demands the same from his victim and what's the key to taking responsibility, making a choice, Kramer Spurs his victims into life. Affirming action

Speaker 2:          09:59          seems to me that two of your sons, impending death is causing you to forgive his sins, to wipe the slate clean. Why is it that you're willing to do that? When a life is at stake

Speaker 1:          10:11          in the moment of making a choice? Kick regard believed that a man becomes himself. Similarly, Kramer is adamant that his victims choose their actions even ending each of his games with this Yoda like refrain. He also maintains that the individual is responsible for the outcome of their decision within the confines of the game. I've never murdered anyone in my life. The decisions are up to them. While many horror films offer an ultimate salvation

Speaker 1:          10:46          saw, does not offer any kind of hope for a better tomorrow. Instead, it seems to critique this extreme version of traditional Christian morality. Throughout the series Kramer's positioned as a god like figure monk or even martyr, he dresses in a long black hooded cape acquires flocks of disciples and performed baptisms. You also maintains the quality of omniscience. He's always watching his victims through camera monitors or people's, so jigsaw may be a godlike figure, but he's a seriously failed one. His attempt to establish a moral order does not bring about meaningful change that kramer professes. It will. For starters, most of his victims failed their tests. They crumble under pressure or can't withstand the pain. Those who do pass are frequently traumatized.

Speaker 2:          11:32          You want to know the best thing that happened to me after having to cut off my own, our handicap parking at the mall.

Speaker 1:          11:43          Further revealing the full extent of jigsaws failure is this ill fated quest for the right apprentice. Each of his contenders twists his philosophy while jigsaw creates games that are truly winnable. If you follow the rules, you can choose to preserve your life as long as you're willing to part with say your left arm. His mentees on the other hand, create rig games that are unwinnable death traps. Blowing up Jake's last game was to get out. Why was the door well to his disciples? Just used the games to get revenge on people they don't like. Eventually they all end up trapping and killing one another. Adam, jealousy to them, the point of the Games is punishment rather than renewal. So much for Jigsaw is legacy. The characters in the Sol films frequently remind the audience that this is a seriously flawed moral code. You said you wanted to talk then you said you wanted to play a game.

Speaker 1:          12:29          You're talking, but it means nothing just before her death. Amanda Denounces Him. Nobody is going. Lastly, because Jigsaw is presented as a god like figure, you would expect that his justice be dispensed fairly, but it's not. He's the villain of the series and his morality lessons frequently sacrifice innocent human lives. Similarly, you'd expect his death to result in salvation or redemption, but instead he dies after offering one of his victims, Jeff, the opportunity to forgive him instead get violently killed. Scraper, even Kramer's own death is the result of one of his tests, ultimate failures, and he didn't even get to eat a tasty, delicious apple so much for finding spiritual rebirth and a reverse bear trap. Still plenty with seem to find value in less intensive experiences of suffering. Just look at marathon runners or competitive hotdog eaters.
