Speaker 1:          00:00          Hey guys, pilot season continues that wise crack. This one is another format that's going to deal with real world issues rather than focusing on media. And another reason why we're excited about this one is this is a continuation of a collaboration we've had going on for a while and that is with an artist named Jr who has been the illustrator for thug notes since the beginning. She did all the art for this. We're super excited to get it out into the world. Hope you guys enjoy it. Let us know. And on with the show in October of 1992 when the worldwide web was just a few years old and the idea of streaming terabytes of pornography was just a far fetched dream. A presidential candidate had an interesting idea.

Speaker 2:          00:40          I will have a unique mandate. They were going to end the form, the people in detail on the issues through an electronic town hall so that they really know what's going on.

Speaker 1:          00:50          Perot wasn't talking about the Internet exactly. He wanted to use technology to revolutionize democracy. For instance, televised town halls or debates could allow viewers to chime in with their phones. Press one for agree to for disagree like many others, parole believe new technology could break down barriers between decision makers and the average citizen.

Speaker 2:          01:12          Now all these phil is $1,000 suits and alligator shoes running up and down the halls of Congress that make policy. Now, the lobbyists, the pack guys, the foreign lobbyist, what have heavy, they'll be over there in the Smithsonian, you know, we're going to get rid of them. Wasn't

Speaker 1:          01:26          the first to suggest this kind of electronic democracy and he won't leave the last. For those who lamented the corporate controlled media or the limited flow of information in authoritarian regimes, the Internet was a godsend. One wired article proudly announced that netizens we're better informed and more civically engaged in they're unconnected peers. By 1997 emir, 8.5% of the population was considered connected, but they voted more, had greater trust in democracy and we're more likely to know basic information like who the chief justice is. In other words, these connected citizens were a bastion of light in the political ecosystem, but has this light dimmed? Was it ever there at all? Sure, we can now access unprecedented amounts of information, but as you've probably guessed, something is wrong with the Internet. Let's fast forward to 2010 young people are doing exactly what futurists predicted, connecting on twitter and coming out in the streets to protest oppressive regimes in Egypt, Tunisia, and elsewhere.

Speaker 1:          02:31          The media heralded the Arab spring as the first social media revolution, the promise of the Internet inaction. Before the Internet, political organizing was risky. Business, stump speeches and flyer distribution were great ways to end up in jail. Now, in the age of tweets heard round the world, one can instigate change from the safety of one's own home until your movement is too large to quell, but despite the praise the Internet earned for his in the Arab spring, some have argued that the uprisings proof that the internet can actually stifle politics. Why? Because in Egypt at least the real revolution didn't start until the Internet went dark on January 28th, 2011 after several days of widespread protests, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak shutdown the country's internet like all of it, cell phones too in anticipation of what had been billed as the biggest of all days of rallies, the government completely shut down the Internet in an attempt to stop people from communicating.

Speaker 1:          03:35          One paper argued that the lack of internet intensified revolutionary unrest in three ways. He angered those who were otherwise unaware or uninterested in the unrest. It forced more face to face communication and it decentralized the rebellion, making it even harder to put down. Similarly, the Iranian revolution of 1978 and 1979 took place only after a news blackout, which raises another question. What if exposure to information doesn't necessarily compel us to fix injustices or clamor for a better world, but just makes us more content with the status quo? The author was inspired by another paper that looked at East Germans living under communism who had access to Western media.

Speaker 3:          04:21          I understand our gathering today as being broadcast as well. In the east to those listening in East Berlin a special word.

Speaker 1:          04:30          You might think that seeing a world of freedom would inspire the East Germans too to test their oppressive regime and spur them to rebel, but it did exactly the opposite. Eastern Germans with access to western TV found their life under communism more tolerable than their peers without it. TV offered an escape from food lines at state propaganda. Why fight for a better world when you can just watch one? Why jump over a shark on water skis if you can just watch the funds do it and why participate in politics when you can just retweet someone else's virtue. In 2014 researchers looked at the saved are for cause on facebook. What they found at this point probably won't surprise you. The vast majority of caused members recruited no one else into the cause and contributed no money to it, suggesting facebook conjured and illusion of activism rather than facilitating the real thing.

Speaker 1:          05:25          To be fair. There are counter examples like the als ice bucket challenge, which raised unprecedented amounts of money to fight the disease, but entering a credit card number is a lot different than being an engaged citizen where problems are a little more complicated than dumping money into research. And what about our electronic town halls or the promise that digital citizens will be more informed than previous generations. In 2014 a pew research poll claimed that thanks to the Internet at least people felt more informed, but what should we make of feeling more informed? Well, as early as 1996 mit researchers prophetically declared that the internet ran the risk of becoming what they referred to as a cyber Balkans, like the countries of the Balkan peninsula, which became increasingly fragmented and hostile toward one another. The Internet would create insular realities for its users. In other words, they identified echo chambers 20 years before everyone freaked out about them.

Speaker 1:          06:26          The point is access to information doesn't necessarily dispel falsehoods. It can amplify them rather than discrediting flat earthers, anti-vaxxers and whatever the hell goop is. The Internet has helped them thrive. And for the rest of us. Why challenge your own perspectives when you can find sources that think like you do. So what gifts as one philosopher notes, as we produce more knowledge, what we gained in Brett, we lose in depth. Everyone has an opinion but is never committed to act on it. Why? Because of what he considers to be two of the worst calamities of the modern era and an entity and the press. But this philosopher wasn't talking about the internet or even the modern era because he died in 1855 what soren kierkegaard identified as problems in the 18 hundreds anonymity, public opinion and arm chair intellectual wisdom have been given mega steroids in the age of the Internet here regard argued the press invited us to become detached spectators.

Speaker 1:          07:29          Divorcing thought from action ideas where homogenized as everyone began to read the same sources. Now we read the same and hit like and share if we agree, no independent thought needed, but before getting too cynical, should we ask, is this the fault of the Internet itself or things on it like facebook or Blowgun? Paul, there are tons of examples. Some studied and some not of the bright side of the Internet, times for the Internet helped organize a community or connect old friends or let people explore who they really are. But rather than looking at specific content, it's important to understand the modern internet as a system with a supreme mandate to produce knowledge, specifically knowledge about you, tailored for you and often produced by you. The Internet isn't about what kind of knowledge is produced. It's concerned with the ever accelerating exchange of information in general. More photos, more kickstarters, more video watch time. It's a system that cares about scale, not quality, not integrity. And despite this ever increasing exchange of information, the Internet seems to generate isolation wherever it goes from early Internet studies that show users feel more lonely and depressed on a micro level to the balkanization of our political landscape on a macro level. Whereas Internet evangelists thought that access to information would connect people like never before. It's managed to do exactly the opposite. But Hey, at least there's this Bay Bay Bay,

Speaker 4:          09:14          cause I don't know what happened. Oh No. Just say it. Just say, you love me, me fall back into speed.

Speaker 1:          09:51          All right, hope you guys enjoyed that as much as I did. A lot of work went into this. We've been working on it since about February. We actually cited 36 different sources to make the script work, so you guys can access that research as well as the research for all of our videos over@wisecrackplus.com it's our patrion site. It's because of our patrons that were able to do video experiments like this one. Most importantly, let us know what you guys think. Drop us a comment. Check out our other pilots, the one on fake news and the film tourist. Let us know what you guys like, what you don't like. Your feedback will let us know what we should continue doing, so appreciate it guys. Leave us a comment piece.
