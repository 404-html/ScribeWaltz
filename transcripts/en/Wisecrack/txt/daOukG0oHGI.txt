Speaker 1:          00:02          What's up guys, jared here on the set of one of our other projects, so infinity war is finally out. We saw it and wanted to try something new, whereas we usually dive into the themes, ideologies, and subtexts of these films to gain a better appreciation for them today. We're going to use these elements to propose some educated predictions of what will happen in a vendors for so welcome to this wise crack quick take on infinity war, part one. Spoilers ahead for part one, and if we're flattering ourselves, part two. Also a huge things to digital sputnik for supplying us with their gear to make these quick takes and all of our other shoots look pretty awesome. They make it so easy to just throw up some lights and shoot. So thanks again to digital sputnik for making lighting fun for us. Now on with the quick take, the central question of infinity war is whether the value of an individual life can be weighed against the greater good throughout the film.

Speaker 1:          00:54          Characters are posed with the conundrum should they sacrifice a loved one for the greater good at the films climax scarlet, which attempts to kill vision for lover in order to destroy the mind stone. Similarly, quill reluctantly tries to shoot Gomorrah, his lover only for his blast to turn into bubbles and later thanos throws her off the altar on for me or as a sacrifice to earn the soul stone. This is one of moral philosophies all time. Classic debates, one that we've talked about before, utilitarian, consequentialism versus deontology. To briefly summarize, utilitarian. Consequentialism defines actions as ethical if they achieve a positive outcome for them. Most people, no matter what one must do to achieve those ends. Deontology on the other hand, is a duty based ethic that suggests that no outcomes can justify heinous things like murder. I'm going to neutralize a lot of threats before they even happen.

Speaker 1:          01:48          That's punishment usually came after the crime, scarlet witch, star, Lord, and then I was all ultimately make their moral decisions based on consequences instead of duties. For everyone that's not a rip off of dark side. This greater good is fairly straightforward. Do anything to stop Vanos from gathering all the infinity mcgovern's. It's basically trolley problem, the movie you are arriving a trolley when the brakes fail and on the track ahead of you are five workman that you will run over. Now you can steer to another track, but on that track is one person you would kill instead of the five. The mad titans understanding of good is a universe in perfect balance, firstly, balance between life and death and secondly balanced between humans and resources. This second one echoes the economic philosophies of Thomas Robert Malthus who suggested that when you have finite resources, you therefore have an ideal population size and when you exceed that population size, poverty and starvation increase, but ultimately the film is critical of anyone who tries to use math to measure the word of some lives against others, these sacrifices and never actually succeed in bringing about the greater good.

Speaker 1:          03:02          Their actions are at best few tile and at worst maximally evil star, Lord and scarlet witch is attempts to sacrifice their loved ones are thwarted by Thanos and fall apart. In a matter of moments. We see this critique again when at the beginning Dr. strange says he won't hesitate to let Tony or Peter die to protect the timestamp. This changes when at the end he reneged and trades the time stone for Tony's life in recognition of a higher moral duty. This is best articulated in captain America is constant refrain. We don't trade lives basically, if you ever want to know what the film's regard as right look no further than the mcu is moral exemplar. Steve Rogers. So what does the films moral perspective tell us about what will happen in avengers four. To answer that, let's take a look at the comic run that inspired infinity war even more than Jim's Darwin's Infinity Gauntlet mini series.

Speaker 1:          03:56          We're talking of course about Jonathan Hickman's epic marble run that weaves its way through fantastic for future foundation of vendors, new avengers, infinity, and secret wars. This is the run that it introduced the coal obsidian outriders and the battle of will conda from the film's finale, but most importantly, infinitely wars. Moral philosophy is ripped right from Hickman. If you thought the stakes were high in this movie, check this. An infinite number of parallel universes were colliding together at the point of earth threatening to annihilate their trillions of inhabitants. The only way to prevent this was to destroy one of the Earth's along with the billions of people living on it, or to put it another way, killing millions to say it was the ultimate trolley problem with all of existence tied to the tracks and heroes like iron man and Black Panther forced to grapple with whether or not to pull the lever in a moment of truth for all involved to child walks right up to the moral line before refusing to cross it.

Speaker 1:          04:54          I know I should. I know I must, but it's wrong. We were damned the very day we thought it was for men to decide things such as this as always, it's captain America who most clearly champions duty based morality that like roar shack is utterly uncompromising. Even in the face of Armageddon, I don't let people die because it's the lesser of two evils or expedient or because it serves the greater good. I don't compare the act against something else. I see someone who needs help and I help. I don't measure people's lives. I saved them, but perhaps the ultimate exemplar of duty based doing what is right, ethics and Hickman's work is Mr. fantastic himself, Reed Richards, and it's his arch that will be most telling for how avengers four will conclude in secret wars Dr. Doom like fantasies with the infinity gauntlet has become for all intensive purposes, God, but he's not defeated by force or a clever plan, but by recognition that reed is a genuinely, morally superior man who would have been at being God. This is Hickman's main thesis and one we think will play out in avengers for one, ought not way lives and calculate how to achieve the greatest good, but instead merely act according to one's duty. So here are our predictions for avengers for one fan. I won't be able to enjoy that sunset at the end of the movie quite as much as he had hoped. His regret over Gomorrah's death will convince him that a single life can have irreducible worth even one way against a world in which everyone enjoys peace and plenty, which obviously they won't.

Speaker 2:          06:31          It was still a stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid plan,

Speaker 1:          06:41          so fantas will neither be forced nor tricked into giving up the gauntlet. It's too hard to punch or trick God. No Fan Osu like doom in Hickman. Secret wars will become convinced by our heroes that his convictions were wrong, that he doesn't deserve to be God, and he will forfeit his power freely to the one who will convince Dan will be Tony Stark. Since the first iron man movie stark has been the defacto protagonist of the franchise more than any other character, he's had the most dynamic character arcs from narcissistic to self sacrificial and avengers, one to the antagonist mired in consequentialist ethics and civil war to realizing his ultimate failure and infinity war. He will achieve the greatest redemption in the end. Firstly, by coming around to caps, duty-bound way of seeing the world, and secondly, by being the one to defeat fan owes more than any other character.

Speaker 1:          07:36          Tony has made the most improvement and is in need of the most improvements. Still he'll go from someone too selfish to handle a relationship to someone so noble as to wield the power of a god with integrity. We're guessing that starks conversation with pepper about his dream of her being pregnant will propel this final growth in his character, but we're not quite sure as to how lastly, Stephen strange his decision not to sacrifice Tony's life to save the time. Stone will prove the crux around which stark success and therefore the salvation of the universe will resolve. But importantly it won't be because strange saw that that was the only way to achieve that one in 14 million future, but for no other reason. Then it was the right thing to do as an Hickman's work. It will be explicit that doing the right thing for no other reason than because it's right will lead our heroes to salvation.
