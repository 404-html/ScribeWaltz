Speaker 1:          00:04          The reason why we have a much better handle on crime now is because we have trained the police to be police. That social workers, it's not their job, not educated. It's not their job to a degree, not even role models. They have to be like Sergeant Joe Friday out there. They won't have time to sit down and have a cup of coffee and Nashawn what's taking place because we have turned the police department into a reactive agency. They're not proactive. So they're racing around going from one nine one one call to another nine one one call. Now that's not the kind of policing I like, but that's just the way it is. So if the cops are going to be responsive, they can't always sit down and try to figure out who's right, who's wrong. So their job is lock everyone up, take them into the WHO Scow, the cop shop, and the judge.

Speaker 1:          00:51          Figure it out at arraignment. Who should it be released? Who should be incarcerated, who should be given bail, who should be remanded to jail? That's good policing when you have limited resource and what the recessionary times where in and no longer any stimulus money to keep cops on the payroll with less cops in enables you to do more. So I think that's why at this point was still able to keep the crime down significantly in a time of recession. But we can only hold out for so much time as we have less and less police and more and more people taking advantage of the criminal opportunities that are before them.

Speaker 1:          01:31          Absolutely. The better educated you are, it just means you have an opportunity to become a more well healed criminal command, white collar criminal with a number two pencil and rip off everybody by going to Wall Street where the banks are too big to fail and then we bail you out. So instead of doing triple life without parole, for sticking a gun in somebody's back and Robin on a $25 you'll rob them for $25 million. But you know something, at least you can read the Wall Street Journal, right? Isn't that an advantage in life now? In reality, it's the basic ability to take care of yourself and for those that you have responsibilities of. So learning what life is about now nowadays the pension is to have you or an an academic diploma. Most people that I've ever met, including myself, cause I don't have a diploma, I got kicked out of high school and not going to qualify for an academic diploma.

Speaker 1:          02:23          They're not going to go on to college. They're not going to get a bs or whatever that is or an fact magnet coombe loudly cause some of them are going to major in having a 44 magnum in their hand. So they need to be taught skills. It's called technical high school. It's called in middle school. Finding out if their adaptability is in the academic world or it's that their thoracic and that they like to work with their hands and they'd like to learn a trade and then giving them the opportunity to do what it is that they decided to do. Even charter schools nowadays, it's not full charter schools is the answer. You know, it's more focused. It's more disciplined and gives the child a better opportunity in the belly of the beast. It's not one charter school in America that's devoted to teaching technical skills.

Speaker 1:          03:09          So is everybody going to be a white collar workers? Everybody is going to be a go to Wall Street and become a thief and a financial institution or a bank. And then tell us how they should reward themselves with a bonus because they worked so hard. Robbing US morning, noon and night with derivatives and subprime mortgages and giving out loans to people who have no income, no jobs, no credit. I know that's wrong. You know that trump, but hey, they're smarter than us. Got Brighter than us. They went to Harvard, they went to Yale and went to the London School of Economics. They went to wharton, the business school. Ooh, far tall. All of them send them to get more lock 'em up. That's right. Since we're clearing amount of terrorists, I'll kind of nut nate's right and tally mine wanting, but he's, why don't we put all the white collar criminals over there and get Mo..
