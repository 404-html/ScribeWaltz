Speaker 1:          00:00          This video is sponsored by legal zoom more on legal zoom at the end of the video. Hey, wise crack jared again. Now I don't know about you, but every time a new Christopher Nolan movie comes out, I happily shell out my harder and 25 bucks for a sweet imax 70 millimeter experience. There are few directors today that can meld thought provoking philosophy with big budgets, spectacle, but Nolan well, he makes it look as easy as spinning a top. Now, instead of focusing on one particular Nolan film, we're going to take a step back and look at his entire filmography because throughout all 10 of Nolan's movies, certain themes keep coming back. In fact, there's so much to discuss. We've pulled the ultimate Hollywood move. Today's Christopher Nolan video will be the first of three on the director. Now, don't worry, we're not pulling a hobbit and extending a children's book into a seven hour trilogy.

Speaker 1:          00:48          Think of this instead, if you will, as our Lord of the rings. There's just so much great stuff to say about Nolan that we have to make three videos in order to do his work justice. So sit back in your recliner chair and welcome to this epic wisecrack Imax 70 millimeter presentation of the philosophy of Christopher Nolan, part one, and of course spoilers ahead, Christopher. Nolan's films can be broken down into three distinct phases, the self, society, and the universe. The first phase we'll discuss the self includes Nolan's early work following Momento, insomnia, and the prestige as well as inception. These films questioned the nature of personhood. Can we ever truly know someone else? Can we know ourselves in our own thoughts, be trusted. Hell, what even is a person to better understand how these questions develop and Nolan's work. We're first going to have to learn a little something about what French philosopher Paul record calls the hermeneutics of suspicion, or as the cool kids say, Hos hermeneutics studies how people interpret text.

Speaker 1:          01:49          Think of how a biblical verse can be interpreted any number of ways Christ's crucifixion could be thought of as an allegorical, moral, or even literal story. Hermeneutics looks at all these different interpretations. Focusing on the methodologies people use to justify their interpretations and it's not just biblical texts, legal, literary, philosophical. Pretty much any text you can think of falls within hermeneutics. Heck, I mean wisecrack is basically just one giant site dedicated to hermeneutics. All we do is interpret text, film, television, literature, video games, you name it, but record questions. These so called interpretations, identifying a group of outside the box. Philosophers committed to drawing out less visible and flattering Truett's record called this group the school of suspicion which sort of sounds like an erotic French thriller starring Charlotte rampling and Ludovic saying Yay, but unfortunately it's just three dudes with facial hair, Friedrich Nietzsche, Karl Marx, and Sigmund Freud.

Speaker 1:          02:45          According to record these figures and the lineage day inspired, we're committed to unmasking the lies and illusions of consciousness. They circumvented self evident meanings in text, focusing on what wasn't said and the contradictions within all to decode a true disguised meaning. So while religious stories like Christ's resurrection may seem to be about how man achieve salvation for the school of suspicion, these stories disguised a hidden meaning. Mark stated that the true purpose of religious narratives were to make the misery of life more endurable, Micha unmasked religion as the refuge for the week, giving purpose to the mentally fragile, and Freud thought that religion was an illusion that substituted ones wished for a father with God. Now yes, hermeneutics of suspicion typically only applies to text, but it can be used more broadly to refer to any so called interpretation. We hold a self evident and what's more self evident and well ourselves.

Speaker 1:          03:40          Yes, you youtube viewers watching this video with your eight tabs open and fidget, spinner in hand, what we drink, watch where fink believe all inform how we interpret ourselves and others, much like the Hos Nolan questions, the conclusions that come from standard interpretations. He confounds our assumed knowledge, challenging our presuppositions to reveal deeper disguised truths about who the hell we really are. Nolan's films are always about that suspicious relation between our subjective reality and the idea of an objective reality. Now, this might sound like idealism to the philosophically inclined among you, but we're not arguing that Nolan dismisses any external reality, but rather he embraces a critical disposition toward the accepted notions of the self.

Speaker 1:          04:24          Take Christopher Nolan's debut following the black and white indy follows billy, a struggling writer who obsessively watched people from afar to get inspiration for his novel. One day he follows a well dressed thief named cobb. No, not that one. After he robbed a house, cobb quickly notices billy watching, but instead of running away or attacking the stocker, he invites billy to join in on his robberies. Interested now see, cobb is far less interested in stealing precious items than in figuring out the lives of people through their possessions, freaking in entering someone's life, finding out who they really are. Both cobb and billy interpret and construct their own images of people, Bill, he by following strangers around and Cobb by breaking into people's homes and rifling through their belongings. But Nolan immediately questions. If these conclusions hold any merit suggesting you can't rely on appearances in possessions to define a person, as cop himself says, when burglarizing a house, take it away for cub, violating a person's property forces his victims to reevaluate themselves.

Speaker 1:          05:30          When the possessions people hold dear are taken away or altered it in effect causes them to question their identity. Nolan also questions peoples reliance on appearances, carb urges billy to cut his hair and don his same suits which bill he immediately does because he wants to be just like his mentor, but this is all a setup. The blonde woman is working with Cobb to frame building the earlier break in and make over just a long con on the poor writer. Billy's own presuppositions of cop are revealed to be false, a far more dastardly intent lurking beneath his friendly smile and mentorship.

Speaker 2:          06:09          Compliment Nolan's

Speaker 1:          06:12          suspicion towards using possessions and appearance to define others carries over to his next feature momento the film's protagonists. Leonard suffers from anterograde Amnesia and relies on a series of possessions, photographs, notes, and tattoos to remind himself of who the people around him are and whether they can be trusted. Leonard puts complete faith in these items depending on them exclusively to guide his actions. He trusts natalie because his notes tell him to be kills teddy because again, his notes tell him to. He's the one he believes the car parked outside his, his because he has a photograph that tells himself

Speaker 2:          06:50          my car is your car. Oh, you're in a playful mood,

Speaker 1:          06:53          but of course these momentos aren't nearly as reliable as Leonard belief.

Speaker 2:          06:58          He don't even know my name. Teddy [inaudible]. You read it off of the picture.

Speaker 1:          07:02          Nolan, in true hos fashion creates drama by throwing suspicion toward the validity of texts. In this case, photographs, notes, and tattoos. How can we trust something we read if the source itself is questionable? Truth is Natalie. Can't be trusted. That car parked out front actually doesn't belong to Leonard and Teddy. Well, he's not the guy. Leonard could kill it all. Leonard may say,

Speaker 2:          07:25          well, I go on facts, not recommendations, but thank you,

Speaker 1:          07:28          but if the truths these facts are based on are incorrect, then what use are they? Nolan constantly draws a distinction between Leonard subjective reality and the idea of objective truth.

Speaker 3:          07:40          Well, what we were trying to do is essentially present a, an idea of the tension between a subjective view of the world, the subjective way in which we have to experience life, and then our faith in an objective reality. Beyond that,

Speaker 1:          07:57          in Leonard's subjective view, he's a husband avenging the rape and murder of his wife after a break in, but as the film reveals, his wife actually survived this initial attack. It was Leonard who accidentally killed his wife, forgetting he had already given her her insulin shot. Moreover, Leonard actually already caught and murdered his wife's rapist over a year ago. He uses text to trick himself into believing that this idealized revenge mission still exists.

Speaker 2:          08:24          You don't want the truth. You make up your own truth like he police. It was complete when I gave it to you who took out the 12 pages? You know, it wasn't me saying was you don't do that to create a puzzle. You could never solve

Speaker 1:          08:38          Leonard conditions themselves to believe in the lives he's created to the point where even his own longterm memories are fabricated. He substitutes the story of Sammy Jankis for his own so he doesn't have to live with the guilt of accidentally murdering his wife. Nolan here extends the Hermeneutics of suspicion from simple texts. Leonard's unreliable notes to Leonard himself, his own false memories.

Speaker 2:          09:01          I lie to myself to be happy in your case, Teddy. Yes, I will.

Speaker 1:          09:08          This suspicion continues into Nolan's third feature insomnia, wherein Momento Leonard is an unreliable narrator who's unable to discern reality from his own fiction. Insomnia's chief protagonists, detective will. Dormer seems to be the opposite. He's reliable, intelligent, and perceptive, but if momento focused on a broken man, attempting to rebuild his sense of self insomnia takes the counter approach showing how even the most rock solid guy like say an Alpha Chino can crumble in the self doubt with just a little push.

Speaker 2:          09:39          See, madness, as you know, is like gravity. All it takes is a little push

Speaker 1:          09:47          hold up ledger. We'll get to you in part two anyway, after will mistakenly shoots his partner in the fog. The guilt of the event triggers intense psychological confusion and well insomnia. He hallucinates his dead partner room, seemed to distort around will and everyday noises become blisteringly. Irritating. Later, we'll hallucinates that he actually did see his partner in the fog and that he deliberately shot him. Unlike momento insomnia, provides no clear explanation about what is true, did will deliberately shoot his partner, or was it just an accident? The answer who knows Nolan yet again extends the Hermeneutics of suspicion. Now questioning reality itself, he implies it's much more complicated than just accepting either pure objectivity or subjective idealism. Perhaps we can't ever be sure of the world around us by the end of insomnia. Will doesn't even know if he deliberately shot his partner or not. Did you mean to shoot hat anymore?

Speaker 1:          10:51          The Prestige is pretty much Nolan's greatest hits as he tackles all the hermeneutics of suspicion from his earlier work. They'll film is told through a series of journals, many of which are fake. Once again, casting suspicion on good old texts, all of the films magicians use disguises to mask their tricks. The Great Chung Lynn Sue pretends to be a cripple Alford borden where's disguises to mask that he has a twin and both Alfred and his Frenemy, Robert and repeatedly pretend to be audience members like in following and Momento. Appearances can't be trusted and the self is constantly put into doubt. Even Alfred's own wife doesn't know his secret, confused that her husband could be so loving one day and so cold, the next unaware of the existence of her husband's twin.

Speaker 2:          11:37          I love you today. Some days it's not true today. You don't mean it. I love you today. It's true.

Speaker 1:          11:46          No one uses magic yet again to question subjective reality versus the idea of objective truth. From the audience's subjective point of view, the bird really does disappear and then reappear, but in reality, there were actually two twin birds, one dead beneath the table, the other reappearing and the magician's hands.

Speaker 2:          12:06          No,

Speaker 1:          12:11          just asthma. Mentos Leonard prefers to live in the illusion of is manipulated subjective reality. The audience to prefers illusion over truth. They don't want to know how Robert Literally duplicating himself each night, murdering his double in a water tank beneath the stage. They'd much rather live under the lie that Robert Disappears and then suddenly reappears on the opposite end of the theater.

Speaker 2:          12:35          People actually believes the things I did on stage. They wouldn't clap that screaming

Speaker 1:          12:40          as a filmmaker. Nolan views himself like these magicians. He plays with illusion and Mr. Direction to keep the audience guessing. We know that we're watching a movie, a projection on a screen and illusion, but we don't really want to know this truth, so we revel in the imaginary world that Nolan has crafted. This is what Nolan ultimately wants to affect the audience through trickery. For him, the truth deep down is that we prefer the imaginary over reality.

Speaker 2:          13:08          What is knows the truth, solid

Speaker 1:          13:35          Nolan suspicion towards reality. Climaxes in inception of film work, every single thing is put into doubt. That guy who looks like Tom Berenger, well, that's actually Tom Hardy, can trust your eyes that thought you just had. It's actually been implanted by Leonardo Dicaprio. Can't trust yourself, your children waiting to play outside. Actually, it's all a dream. Maybe can't trust anything. Inceptions protagonists, dream thief, carb. No, not that one can barely discern his reality from a dream to the point where it doesn't even matter in Cobb's supposed reality, he's on the run, chased by goons with guns through Byzantine pathways in Cobb, supposed to dream. He's well still on the run, chased by goons with guns through Byzantine pathways,

Speaker 2:          14:18          chase around the globe by anonymous corporations and these courses and where the protections persecute the dream to me. You don't believe in one reality anymore.

Speaker 1:          14:28          Nolan deliberately draws this parallel to showcase how muddled the two are put simply, there is no difference between dream and reality because subjectively cop can't tell the difference, such as the fate for COBB's wife mall. She believes that her reality is still a dream and to wake up she must kill herself.

Speaker 2:          14:47          Possessed by an idea. This one very simple idea and changed everything that our world wasn't real. She needed to wake up to come back to reality,

Speaker 1:          15:01          but what is malts actually right? What if cobb has been dreaming the whole time? What if you're wrong? What if I'm. What's real, no definitive answer is ever given, which is exactly Nolan's point in the end, only the question remains that last indelible image of that Damn spinnings hopped, spinning, but just slightly wavering, provides no definitive answer as to have carb is dreaming or awake only further proving that in the end there is no truth, no reality, only the suspicion thereof, well at least until we get to part three, through each of Nolan's early films, he casts doubt on appearances, on possessions, on others, on ourselves, on our thoughts, and finally on reality, but if you can't trust anybody else and you can't trust yourself and holy, you can't even trust the reality surrounding you, then how the hell does society function? How can people come together and form a stable working unit?
