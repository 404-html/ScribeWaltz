Speaker 1:          00:00          This video is brought to you by skillshare.

Speaker 1:          00:06          What's up guys? Jared again. Today we're talking about one of the most nuanced takes on geek culture out there. The Big Bang theory. Yep. Nope, not even close. It's bad. Like really bad. In fact, it's become somewhat of a recurring gag for us to hate on this show, so when you sadistic maniacs asked for what went wrong, we reached out to one of our unfortunate writers, Thomas, but instead of making this poor bastard watch all 5,000, 175 minutes of this show, we just hopped on imdv and grabbed the top 10 rated episodes. Sorry, we cannot afford to pay this man's therapist, but I digress. Why is a show that deals with science, comics and all that good wise crack stuff so bad? Well, after hours of grueling research, we suspect it might have something to do with references, so it's subtle. The fate of doctor who's Tardis will be decided by a game of thrones inspired death match on the battlefield of thunder cats versus transformers.

Speaker 1:          01:04          See, the Big Bang theory isn't just bad. It's profoundly bad. It's so bad that it requires philosophy to understand just how bad it is, so join me as I attempt to convince you that the Big Bang theory is proof that meaning is dead, woken Louis wise crack addition on the Big Bang theory, what went wrong and big. Shout out to the real MVP, Thomas for watching this garbage. The Big Bang theory loves referentiality. They referenced cornerstones of nerd culture like star Trek. Sheldon's log three, four, five point three for Battlestar Galactica. That's my original series, battlestar Galactica flight suit, and even scientific facts and mathematical formulas. They're slipped in to remind us over and over again that Leonard, Sheldon, and company are diehard nerds. They buy comics, perform science experiments, and sometimes described very basic things like slipping in a bathtub like this. Not Surprising. You have no safety math or adhesive stickers to allow for purchase on the surface with a low coefficient of static friction.

Speaker 1:          02:10          Now, in case you missed the laugh track, sheldon giving penny, the definition of friction was the joke. You see? It's funny because it's a reference now. If you're wondering why you feel a bit cheated at the punchline here, it's probably because that definition of friction was simply slotted in there and the other scientific statement about the nature of reality feels like it could have had the same effect here, like gravity for instance, and cue the next job. I got to go to the emergency room. Well, let's say when you're correct, did you write humorous is no longer seated in the glenoid socket? I would certainly think so. They could have replaced the word humorous and glenoid socket with jibberish and most wouldn't know the difference and that's the problem. The actual science isn't the job, but the fact that they're talking about science is friction isn't funny.

Speaker 1:          02:54          V referenced to friction is funny. By contrast considered this brief futurama reference. For somebody who barely understands math like me, the reference will probably evade detection, but for those who spot the symbol for all if know the mathematical symbol for an infinite sense of countable numbers, they'll realize that theater is implying there's an infinite number of screens. This not only gives an Easter egg for the mathematically inclined, but more importantly, the joke is the impossibilities of a movie theater having infinite screens. The joke is about the subject of all, if no, not the mere reference to it. The reference imbues the joke with additional meaning, whereas the Big Bang theory accomplishes the opposite. Leonard, do you recall what I said? I was going to revolutionize humanities understanding of the Higgs Boson particle, and you said, sheldon, it's 2:00 AM. Get Out of my bedroom.

Speaker 1:          03:44          These jokes are at best lazy writing and at worst, a small step toward the complete annihilation of reality. Yes, might sound extreme, but these kinds of references with no subject is exactly what kept French philosopher John Beaudry yard up at night to Baudrillard. We're living in a state where reality has been, oh, biliterate. He gives four levels of representation. The first level is like a picture, a perfectly accurate representation of reality. The second level of representation is the unfaithful copy. A filter that makes you look prettier, thus obscuring your actual face. Below. That is the third level of representation. One that deliberately hide the fact that there's no reality being represented like an artist's rendering of you, where they've never actually seen you, and finally the fourth level is reserved for when signs and representations start referencing other signs and representations and all sense of reality is thrown out the window.

Speaker 1:          04:38          This is when people start photoshopping a photoshop image or making memes of other memes in butchery. Art's eyes were already living in a world controlled by a system of fourth order Simulacra or any reference to the original reality is lost, which might explain why he technically considers our reality a simulation. Now, if we're being optimistic, the Big Bang theory is a distorted view of real nerd culture. The second order of representation, it gets a lot of the details wrong, but it's still about real nerd culture, but if we're being pessimistic and oh, we are, it's a show about nerd culture that has no relation to reality whatsoever. Beathard order of representation, a copy of something that never existed. It has science without actual science. It's about nerd culture. Without real nerds. They're more like, what? Someone who has never met an nerd thinks they're like, that's where the bad science references become relevant to beaudry art more often than not. Jokes rely on characters. Cramming in whatever scientific explanation is relevant to the action when our roadways most slippery now. Okay. There are three answers, none of which are correct. The correct answer is when covered by a film of liquid sufficient to reduce the coefficient of static friction between the tire and the road to essentially zero, but not so deep as to introduce a new source of friction

Speaker 1:          05:57          references for the sake of references. Jokes that don't rely on any understanding of the science, but rather these simple recognition that this is a scientific reference. It's the difference between sheldon explaining how locks work when pennies locked out. Damn key out. It's not surprising that Baldwin lock on your door uses traditional edge mountain cylinders. Whereas the key for your Volkswagen uses a center cylinder system

Speaker 1:          06:24          and when Leila and the professor are racing and drama, Nah, half a lap, you forgotten the mobius strip to lapse is one lap your kids and your topology in the former. The joke doesn't rely on an audience understanding how locks actually work. The reality is irrelevant as long as we recognize that sheldon is being unnecessarily smart. Whereas in future trauma, we're laughing at the actual science referenced in the joke for Beaudry art. As things progress, these copies of reality end up becoming their own reality, and this is where we see boatyards dismal vision reflected in the Big Bang theory. These copies divorced from reality either partly or entirely signal, not only the death of meaning, but make all ideas interchangeable because the jokes in the show are apropos of nothing. The characters can essentially spew meaningless nonsense under the guise of a meaningful job like in the shows game, mystic warlords of Qa, which starts as a kind of joke about magic. The gathering in visibility, spelled luminescent, spell, and then quickly descends into utter nonsense to headed tigers. Three-Headed lion, sulfur brimstone. It doesn't matter if they said two headed tiger, three-headed lions, seven headed ethical Logan, Paul, or Frankfurt school jamming crusted Beagle Monster. The joke will work on the audience no matter what they say, because the show functions at a level of selling you an empty joke under the guise of a meaningful one. So here's the big question, is that if the Big Bang theory's use of reference for reference's sake, ultimately points at nothing, then what are we laughing at? My hair is growing at the rate of four point six meters per femtosecond. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          08:05          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          08:07          Or at least what is the studio audience? Laughing gas. It is scientifically impossible for a person to typical. Seriously. Somebody please tell me her new sounded important, but what you're forgetting is it was an achievement in the field of biology that's all about Yucky squishy thing. Well, after conducting a rigorous study, our team of media experts has come up with an answer. The show basically just it's on its characters. That's all that's happening.

Speaker 3:          08:36          Princeton fine institution. They'll place where Albert Einstein taught and where Leonard got his phd, so it may have gone downhill

Speaker 2:          08:48          like

Speaker 1:          08:49          when Leonard and Raj think about buying Howard a prostitute, following your recent breakup. She's exactly a stipe a WHO, if we hired her, that would cheer him up. We're not going to get Wolowitz a hooker. I'm so lonely and Horny. I may open this $20 jar of peanuts and ended. Okay. Or like when sheldon defenses girlfriend Stewart's kind of interested in amy. Oh, of course she is. She's very interesting. Did you know when she was 14? She suffered the webbing between her own toes.

Speaker 1:          09:31          As it turns out, ripping on people is actually how the philosophy of humor started in the West. The earliest theory of humor is the superiority theory which began with plato saying that laughter was a form of scorn that people we laugh at are generally unaware of how awful they are, which invites our laughter. Later on, Thomas Hobbes modified this a little bit by saying that laughter was a result of our competitive nature. When we laugh, it's either because we're triumphing over another or watching their downfall. Hell, even take heart, waded into the discussion calling laughter. The result of scorn which proceeds from are perceiving a small eval and a person whom we consider to be deserving of it. In the end, all three philosophers agree that when we laugh,

Speaker 1:          10:12          it's at the expense of others to make ourselves feel good. While this might seem pretty obvious, the Big Bang theory isn't Seinfeld. These aren't horrible people deserving our scorn. Case in point, show runner, chuck lorre literally said, the show is not about cakes or nerds, but about extraordinary people, so if they're so extraordinary, why do they deserve to be done? Which brings us to the big picture problem. Instead of building up nerd culture, the big bang theory kind of tears it down when the show simply pays lip service to nerdom mechanically inserting any reference. For reference's sake, the show reveals its contempt for real nerds. The details of nerd culture are irrelevant as long as they sound like winky assholes. It's close enough. I'm attempting to view my work as a fleeting peripheral image to engage the superior Colliculus of my brain, and while the show can fall back on it's laugh, track or rip its characters long. Has he been stuck actually about 30 hours emotionally, about 29 years.

Speaker 2:          11:15          Ultimately,

Speaker 1:          11:15          this does all of us nerds from the buffy fan. So the marvel fans a disservice instead of finding ourselves reflected on screen, we see characters that kind of just get dumped on. So what do you think? Wise crack or we being too harsh on the biggest show in the world, or are we being a bunch of jealous haters, man, not that one.
