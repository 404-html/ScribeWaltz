Speaker 1:          00:00          Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:09          the basic level it has to do with how cells can divide many times. Um, what was known, uh, in the late 19 seventies was that, um, that when you copy a chromosome, the way that the, uh, mechanism copies of chromosome, every time a cell divides the very, very end bit can't be completely copied. Uh, and so then the idea was that the, uh, the chromosomes are the telomeres, which are, the chromosome ends would get shorter and shorter and shorter every time a cell divides. And that can't happen a indefinitely. There has to be some mechanism which will balance that shortening. And that's where the discovery of telomerase a comes in. And so for any cell that has to divide many times, they need to have a way to balance so that there's some shortening and some lengthening and shortening and some lengthening and the equilibrium is maintained, uh, so that the cells can then go on and divide.

Speaker 2:          01:08          We were very interested in, uh, as I said, telomeres and chromosomes and, and how they, um, how they functioned. And so we really went to the source where there are a lot of telomeres. Uh, and this was something that Liz Blackburn had done a number of years before when she had discovered the DNA sequence that telomeres is made up of, and it's a very, very simple repeated dna sequence, uh, that is sort of a monotonous many, many, many repeats. And she had discovered the telomere DNA sequence in this organism called Tetrahymena. It's a single celled organism, very much like the paramecium that high school students might go out to a pond and bring back some pond water and see the paramecium floating around. The thing about Tetrahymena is that they have 40,000 chromosomes. And so it was a very good source to be able to understand what the ends of the chromosomes were. So when we set out to ask, uh, is there an enzyme that can lengthen the chromosomes to balance the shortening? We went again to Tetrahymena, um, and you can just get these organisms and grow them up in the laboratory. So we grow up a large batch of the, of the cells. And then you spin the cells down in a centrifuge. So you make a very compact, a collection of them. And then break them open to get the insides of the cells out so that you can understand what is going on inside the cells.

Speaker 2:          02:29          I think it's more that the discovery was made, uh, in 1984 and uh, it was clear that it was important at the time, but it was important as a very basic cellular mechanism. Um, and uh, there wasn't a lot of questions. I didn't get a lot of people doubting what the conclusion was, but instead it wasn't clear what the implications were. And the 25 years that have intervened, intervened, uh, my lab and Liz is lab and a number of other labs throughout the world have contributed all kinds of different ideas from different avenues that have made it very clear now what the medical implications are. And so there are, are clear medical implications that we didn't know at all. At the beginning. We were just solving a puzzle because we were curious about how cells worked. Although we knew that it was a fundamental mechanism, we weren't just doing experiments just to find out anything but rather to really understand how a cell works. And the 25 years in between really has, um, allowed it to be clear what the implications of that discovery work.
