Speaker 1:          00:05          Hey boys cry if you didn't catch my science of one punch man video. My name is Helen and I'm here to up wise cracks science games. So thanks to brilliant.org for sponsoring this video and join us as we talk about everyone's favorite holiday that institutionalizes the extermination of the core. The purge, the purge is an annual free for all crime spree that in theory allow citizens to rid their wretched soul was a deep seated desires by doing all the murdering and pillaging they want for 12 hours without having to worry about the Popo. Well, the government and the purge obviously has social cleansing at the top of its agenda. Fortunately, the citizens aren't killing enough, so we supplement at all

Speaker 1:          00:46          to keep things balanced. The ostensible reason for the holiday is that if we can be super key for just one day a year, we can behave like model citizens for the other 364 but would it work? Can venting our anger somehow make us less aggressive, sharpen your hacksaws and cock your glocks kids. We'll take a look in this special wisecrack edition of the psychology of the purge, and as always spoilers ahead. The first film opens in a swanky suburban utopia somewhere outside of la. The media is fired up about purge night like it's super bowl Sunday, encouraging citizens everywhere to do their civic duty and release the beast when the clock strikes. Seven American streets will be running red tonight when people release the beast in record numbers of Kelly getting one last walk in before lockdown. Yeah. After all the experts say humans are innately violent creatures, pretending to be anything otherwise is to deny our true nature.

Speaker 2:          01:40          The purge not only contained societal violence to a single evening at the countrywide catharsis creates psychological stability by letting us release the aggression we all have inside of us.

Speaker 1:          01:50          So what is Catharsis anyway? Psychology defines catharsis as the process of experiencing emotional relief through the release of pent up feelings, especially pity for fear. The concept comes from the Greek word for purification or cleansing. It dates back to the days of Aristotle who postulated that watching tragic performances couldn't do such intense feelings of pity or fear that viewers would ultimately be cleansed of these emotions and his work politics. Aristotle writes those who were subject to the emotions of the fitting and fear will necessarily be affected in the same way and so will other men in exact proportion to their susceptibility to such emotions. I'll experience a certain purge catharsis and pleasant release. The new founding fathers had been feeding this idea to the masses for a few years. By the time the first movie opens, even the otherwise benign sanded family is down with the purge, which isn't exactly surprising considering James Profits big time from selling security systems to his fellow well-healed suburbanites. Naturally, James Repeats this logic to his son Charlie saying that grownups have to purge some times to get rid of all their emotional gunk and that it's okay to kill people for one night of the year if it lifts your spirits.

Speaker 3:          03:03          Okay. I know this is difficult to understand that your age, but tonight allows people a release for all the hatred and violence and aggression that they keep up inside them.

Speaker 1:          03:15          The series also is loaded with baptismal language with people justifying their actions with words like cleanse our souls. Be Aware of about a thousand years or so after aristotle made his claim about the Cathartic benefits of theater. Send bs thing, cocaine, Aficionado, Sigmund Freud. Your eyes that were pressing certain kinds of negative emotions could lead to the buildup of phobias, the stereo or nervous outbursts. One possible solution, discharging the emotion by doing unto others as they have to you. In other words, vengeance in there, 1895 book studies on hysteria, Freud and his psych roadshows of Gloria Rhodes. The reaction of an injured person to a trauma has really only a cathartic effect if it is expressed in an adequate reaction like event Brite embroiders ideas on Catharsis for the foundation for the hydraulic model of anger. What suggested frustrations lead to anger? Anger leads to the buildup of negative emotions and built up negative emotions.

Speaker 1:          04:12          Ultimately lead to an explosion of rage, one where you might have just one of those days. We might go over off. The theories that built on this idea suggested that we ought to drain our anger little by little rather than let it all out at once. In a way, that idea is at odds with the type of catharsis that's encouraged in the purge, which is more like saving up your explosion of hostility rather than a steady drain. But the new founding fathers concept has support in a theory by a quintet of psychologists who published a book called the frustration and aggression in 1939 the work postulates the aggression is a consequence of frustration and that aggressive acts lead to a reduction in aggressive drive, which makes it less likely that one will act like this. Inequality. That sounds like it could have come straight from the new founding fathers, psychologist and author Dorothy Brook Roche.

Speaker 1:          05:01          When Pasa cumulates and forms an abscess, the abscess must be opened and drained. If this is not done, the infection spreads. In the end it may destroy the individual. Just so with feelings, the badness must come out. The hurts and fears and anger must be released and drain. Otherwise, these two, they destroyed me. Individual. This so called Catharsis hypothesis was accepted until researchers actually started studying it and one of the first experiments conducted by psychologist Robert Howard Hornberger, a group of participants were insulted. Then half of them were told to hammer nails for 10 minutes, a physical manifestation venting. Afterwards, they were given the chance to criticize the person who did assaulted them. If the Catharsis theory held true, then pounding the nails would make the disgrace participants less aggressive toward the insults. Instead, the opposite happened. The ones who'd hammered nails were actually more hostile.

Speaker 1:          05:54          Subsequent research turned up mixed for the Catharsis hypothesis and according to our review of the evidence conducted by Russell Geen and Michael Conti in 1977 a lot of the studies that had indicated that aggressive behavior reduced once tendency for violence had methodological issues and when replicated the results were the opposite. Canaan. Quanti ultimately concluded that the notion of Catharsis had not confirmed. Psychologist Brad Bushman revisited this idea in 2002 after having someone insulted group of participants, he had them either sit quietly in a punching bag with the aim of getting physically fit or hit a punching bag while thinking about the person who would insulted them. Then he gave them a chance to confront their and salter, those who sat quietly were least likely to be aggressive, while those who had thought about the person who insulted them with the most likely to be aggressive. The ones who hit the bag without thinking about the insult or we're somewhere in between.

Speaker 1:          06:47          This suggests that while getting all worked up from exercise might have increased aggression compared to sitting quietly, ruminating while acting out aggressively was the most likely to amplify anger overall. A contrast to the catharsis hypothesis, Bushman rights venting to reduce anger is like using gasoline to put out a fire. It only feeds the flame. Okay, but is there any evidence that Catharsis is a thing? Maybe according to gene and Quanti, there are circumstances where angered people do seem to calm down if they have the chance to retaliate against their provoker, but the context is pretty specific. The retaliation should be justified and the target can't be intimidating. In other words, expressing anger can be temporarily calming if you aren't left feeling anxious, guilty or afraid that you were about to get your ass kicked. It should also be noted that in the study cited here, Bushman's experiments only look to catharsis over a short window after participant had been insulted, which perhaps leaves open the idea that aggressive behavior could be cathartic over the long term is longer.

Speaker 1:          07:45          Studies on aggression mostly focused on the impact of exposure to violence in the media, but that's a whole nother episode. So if acting out your aggressive urges doesn't relieve your emotional angst and might even make it worse. What does psychology has a couple of suggestions. We strategies like deep breathing, relaxation and cognitive behavioral therapy at the top of the list. Something called primal. Screaming has also been tested, but the results were kind of inconclusive and when it comes to deciding whether to avenge wrongdoing or let it slide, it seems that forgiving or forgetting might be better ways to free your inner demons. 2008 study led by Kevin Carl Smith of colgate university gives evidence that people who have been wronged are less likely to keep thinking about someone who's offended them if they move on without punishing them. And another group of researchers have developed a theory that even though humans are hardwired to want to retaliate against an aggressor, they've evolved to forgive because it's evolutionarily advantageous.

Speaker 1:          08:41          Well, getting revenge against someone might make it less likely that they'll hurt you again. We're telling iation also ruins the chance to gain something from that person later. Thus according to their hypothesis, forgiveness involved as a way for us to have our cake and eat it too. We get over the offense without losing the chance to benefit from the relationship later. The idea that forgiveness is superior to revenge is reflected in the purge through all three of the films, Mary Sand and chooses not to kill her dick bag neighbors despite the fact that they almost hack her children to death. Oh, for God's sake, just do it. Come on.

Speaker 1:          09:16          We're going to play the rest of this night on. Leo doesn't shoot the drunk driver who walked free after killing his kid and Senator Ron Alexa against often owens after he attempts to have her assassinated. Even though doing so would not only have served him right, but also would have handed her the presidential election, which she winds up winning anyway. It appears that the NFFA supporters didn't quite get the memo about forgiveness though as they're already wreaking havoc at the end of the last film and that bet big supporters are reacting violently to this defeat. They are burning cars, so does the purge work. There aren't any studies that let people, you know, go on a homicidal rage for a day, so we're going to err on the side of caution and saying and everyone purging by writing novels worth of anger, Youtube comments. It's not helping. Sorry.

Speaker 1:          10:01          It's too bad because in theory, this still limping. Strangers really does seem like a good way to blow off steam, but let's talk about another theory like what would happen if the earth suddenly stopped spinning? Obviously that would be bad, but what would happen to the objects on the surface when they fly off into space along the straight line tangent to the surface when they fly off along an initial tangent before setting into orbit, would they fly along an initial tangent before arking back to our humble planet or what they skid along earth's surface, following her sexy curves that you don't know the answer, but which she did want to prove me wrong and challenge yourself with new puzzles every week.
