Speaker 1:          00:08          a wise crack. Jared, again, southpark creators, Matt Stone and Trey Parker sure do make us laugh, but they make something else to a metric crap ton of money. It's a tale as old as time, greatest stop, motion, animated Christmas card, nab, comedy central series, a movie, an Oscar nomination, Yada, Yada, Yada, and joy. A collective net worth of $800, million dollars. Yet, despite being an ad supported business like some other people, we know south park has never been afraid to bite the hand that feeds it. So let's take a look at how stone and Parker lampooned the financial world across four of our favorite south park adventures cash rules, everything around us in this widespread condition on economics in south park, in gnomes, the sleepy town of South Park readies itself, very classic David and Goliath battle, a real showdown between massive corporate coffee chain, hard books and the homegrown mom and pop coffee shop tweak brother.

Speaker 2:          01:03          You see, I own a coffee shop and now a great big multimillion dollar company is going to move in and try to take all my business, which means I may have to shut down and sell my son, tweak into slavery.

Speaker 1:          01:12          South Park challenges are natural bias towards the little guy by demonstrating, hey, sometimes the little guy is actually a total asshole and in south park this particular asshole isn't above keeping his own son hopped up on caffeine or exploiting children for the media. If it helps us business stay afloat, it's time to stop large corporations. Prop 10 is about children. Vote yes on prop 10 or else you hate children. The very notion that a small business might be driven by impure capitalist motives is a message we're not used to hearing and the townspeople of Southpark aren't ready for it either, which is why the tweak and horror books rivalry is neatly stereotyped as just another innocent family business versus a big fat magic carpet guy from New York. In fact, throughout the episode, most arguments in favor of big business are immaturely, shouted down, not with reason or facts, but well with immature shouting. Oh, pardon me, Mr assface. Anyway, let's hear your side of the argument. So who's the real bully here? GNOMES demonstrates how bald face appeals to emotion can be used to disguise the cold hard mechanisms of profit.

Speaker 2:          02:18          I've got one for you. How about doing a report on how large corporations take over little family owned businesses,

Speaker 1:          02:23          although he may be a staple of the community who charms people with this folksy marketing Mr. tweak proves himself to be an even more cutthroat capitalist than his rival. Kids are great to get people on our side. You don't just throw a child in a political commercial to sale your beliefs and it isn't long before the preteen protagonists of southpark become convenient ponds in his agenda as they're forced to passes anti-corporate words off as their own,

Speaker 2:          02:48          and as the voluminous corporate automaton bulldoze its way through Belgium America. Perhaps there is no stopping the corporate machine

Speaker 1:          02:57          knowing much about Mr Weekes true business practices or even about the superior quality of the starbucks coffee. It doesn't have that blend. Raw sewage taste that tweaks coffee. Has the people of South Park demonstrate a programmatic response that boils down to simply small business, good big corporation back.

Speaker 1:          03:20          Does it matter if the big corporation is actually an ethical business and if the children in question are foul mouth hell raisers, no it doesn't, and that's thanks to a principle called the backfire effect which says the presentation of any new and contrary information will be dismissed outright threatens your basic belief structure. Try arguing with people on facebook about politics. We're confident you'll change their minds. The gnomes episode of South Park lampoons. This idea of hardwired biases by demonstrating small businesses just like small children can be just as scummy as their larger counterparts. They're just not as prolific about it because after all, as the underpants gnomes of the episode adorably demonstrate both small and large businesses are geared towards making a profit even if there might be some ambiguity about the path toward that objective,

Speaker 3:          04:13          collect underpants.

Speaker 1:          04:20          Where are the gnomes episode satirizes exploitation of children for emotional sympathy, cash for gold, satirizes the exploitation of the elderly for massive profit, and how better to demonstrate this con inaction then by way of the home shopping network. In this episode stand learns his Grandpa has routinely fallen victim to television scams that are draining his retirement funds. Meanwhile, Cartman's rank opportunism drives him to take advantage of those same scams, to feed his insatiable greed from these two angles. Cash for Gold examines both the Predator and the prey through the lens of value theory. There are different theories of value out there. You've probably heard the kind dictated by supply and demand, but value might not necessarily be a financial value, but instead be rooted in social, emotional or historical value and much like financial value, these alternatives can be situational and fluid entering on a variety of intrinsic and extrinsic factors.

Speaker 1:          05:16          Let's take a look at some examples. After stands, grandpa give Stan a bolo tie that was bought off the TV for $6,000. Stand almost immediately learns that the very same tie is worth $15 at the local appraiser. I'll give you $15. Then after pursuing third and fourth opinions stand watches the Bolo Tie diminish and financial value right before his very eyes, until it's worth no more than a seven layer burrito at Taco bell. My grandpa paid $6,000 for something barely worth anything. How does something like this happen? To answer stands? Question. This episode introduces us to multiple forms of value beginning with the market value displayed on the home shopping network. As Dean, the home shopping network hosts uses his authority to convince his elderly viewers. They're getting amazing deals. Those same viewers reliably line dean's pockets. Even though what he's selling is in the frame of material or resale value, pretty much a piece of crap.

Speaker 1:          06:10          Look at these stunning airings. These are genuine fo Sapphire earrings, 14 carat gold, 86 karat photo sapphire. This disconnect is the very mechanism that drives any great scam, high perceived value, married to low actual value where a purely labor oriented view of economics might consider the work that went into producing an item. South Park here exhibits a more nuanced idea, one that proposes value is determined not by quality or by effort of production, but by the nature of supply and demand. And boy does dean know how to drive and exploit that demand at that price. You practically stolen from us. Ouch. And later when Stan urges dean to commit suicide, you should carry yourself. Dean is able to conceptualize his life's work only in the monetary figure it might draw in a lawsuit. Two point $7,000,000 for dean. There's literally no useful value beyond the financial freedom of value, just how much cash he can squeeze from people's wallets. However, we clearly see the impact of emotional value. When stands, grandpa tells the story of his dog.

Speaker 4:          07:20          Brilliant. Did I ever tell you I used to have a border collie named patches? Yes, grandpa. I love that dog. She always made me so happy when she died. I didn't let myself get too sad because I thought thought I'd always have the memory of her slobbery and happy face. I can't remember what she looked like. Billy,

Speaker 1:          07:44          through this monologue, we learn GRANDPA's reckless purchases have little to do with the perceived market value of the items in question. No GRANDPA is trying to add emotional and historical value to himself by creating memories and sentimental connections that will last long past his death. Elsewhere in the story, we learned these fluid and disparate notions of value call into question the true value of nearly everything. We see the perceived cultural value of an academy award evaporate as it's simply melted down to be resold in new forms stands gift to his grandfather. A framed photo of Grandpa with his beloved dog arguably has astronomic emotional value, but low market value thing completely. That means a lot and GRANDPA's six grand gift to Stan is ultimately written off as being

Speaker 4:          08:31          gay gay,

Speaker 5:          08:36          but

Speaker 1:          08:36          just how loose is that relationship between labor and profit. That question sits at the foundation of go fund yourself, an episode in which the South Park kids launched a successful brand that doesn't even bother to put a business behind it. A startup company, a company that does what? No, we don't want to do anything. In fact, the official slogan of their company is lacking, can make their business, which ultimately calls itself The Washington redskins draws at success from the bastardization of modern kickstarter culture, accepting monetary donations in exchange for no effort at all. Here we cut throat. The episode southpark suggests that in the advent of twitter, facebook, and Instagram, the success of a brand or company can now be routed purely in its appearance rather than its function. One of the central arguments of this episode is that what a business does is less valuable to that business then the relative power of its brand. When Stan sets off to find the perfect startup name, this moment carries more important than any objective pursued by Cartman's leadership.

Speaker 3:          09:44          It's the greatest startup company name ever. What Washington Red Skins, I'm pretty sure that's taken carmen,

Speaker 1:          09:51          the episodes, thesis, mirrors and argument made by philosophers, John Boatyard, who argued in 1981 simulacra and simulations that all previous definitions of value had been woefully inadequate. Boatyards work presented that value isn't determined by how much work has gone into making something or by the nature of it's materials or by its overall usefulness. No value is determined purely as the appearance of value. In other words, according to beaudry art, an item or brand is only valued as it exists as an image in relation to other things that are also images. Value then is determined only in the relationship that exists between things or among a set of things through this frame. It's more important for a business to have a great brand than it is to make great stuff. It's more important to be trendy for investors than it is to make fat. Stacks of cash.

Speaker 1:          10:41          Uber being worth billions of dollars while still losing billions of dollars. Yeah, Baudrillard more or less predicted that decades ago in Gofund yourself. The South Park kids take this concept of value to absurd heights, much like the protagonist of Hbo, his entourage, they embrace the idea that the ultimate success lies in not doing anything at all. Just startup cash instead out, bro down, but we still gotta love them because like so many in the real world, the south park kids are just squirrels trying to get a nut. Today's economy is awash with side Hustles, independent contractors and guest lecturers, but economic power lies not with them, says South Park. It sits with the fat cats at the top who know how to work the system with minimal effort or does it ultimately the kids, Washington redskins venture is left in shambles because of the brands. Missteps on a social issue. There's nothing sweet about people who are decimated.

Speaker 1:          11:36          Here are the episode argues that a business built only on aesthetics has nowhere to turn and no foundational beliefs to hold two. Once public opinion turns against it, it turns out even a business that does almost nothing can be threatened by doing or saying or being the wrong thing. At the time in South Park, that outcome leaves our young entrepreneurs faded to the worst punishment of all. I guess we got to go back to ski scratch that there is in fact a worse punishment than going to school and it arrives at the forefront of the episode titled You Have Zero Friends. This episode examines the absurdities of our growing social media economy as in the cash for gold adventure. South Park here tackles head on the true meaning of value.

Speaker 3:          12:22          Looking on facebook today, we see that since adding a loser, kip droughty as a friend dominic,

Speaker 1:          12:28          are our friendships and social worth measured by our likes and facebook connections, or are they determined by the interactions we share in what the cyber punk community derisively refers to as space from the outset of the episode are protagonists, stand side by side in the meat space and debate their respective levels of social status as quantified solely by their collections of online friendships.

Speaker 3:          12:50          I don't have any friends

Speaker 1:          12:55          in this framing. Facebook friendships like money create an easily measurable hierarchy of personal value.

Speaker 3:          13:01          I don't know what to do. I just can't seem to get my friend numbers to go up. The truth is, as long as you have that Kip, Jordy luther is a facebook friend, people view your friendship as a liability. You've got to dump him.

Speaker 1:          13:11          Cartman unsurprisingly sees relationships not as intrinsically joyful, but as status symbols by which to elevate some people over others. If this calls to mind beaudry again, well, it should because in his work, the consumer society yard warned that instead of enhancing life, a transactional approach to relationships leads to an individual lack. Since everything possessed is relativized in relation to others, cartman's troubling view of relationships begins to infect even kyle. When Kyle's digital farm is depleted due to economic hardship, he turns to his long time meetspace friends, Stan, but even after Stan has offered kyle his real world support, all kyle can think about is how much his own social media cache must be suffering. Just so confused that I really need a friend right now. Okay, dude, I'm, I'm here for you Kay, so then get on facebook and fertilize my crops. Shortly thereafter, kyle drops the suite, but socially toxic, kip from his own roster of facebook friends in order to salvage his own social standing south park asks, who are we really when our online presence outweighs our real world engagements, when he insists her relationship with Stan, be validated on the Internet, and even randy doesn't believe in his connection with his own son until Stan agrees to add him on facebook, so I'm not your friend.

Speaker 1:          14:28          Then

Speaker 3:          14:30          Dad, you are my friend,

Speaker 1:          14:32          but you just don't want to add me as a friend

Speaker 3:          14:34          that it's just a stupid click of a button that takes two seconds,

Speaker 1:          14:37          right? But you don't have the two seconds or in our reality and in south park, this disjunction between our digital and real world lives threatens to place a greater premium on our digital behavior and it makes our physical life seem significant and less like an experience.

Speaker 1:          14:58          Perhaps. That's why kyle pushes back against friendships with real people like standing kip. When doing so means preserving his digital status and while everyone else is trying to pump up their digital lives at the expense of their meetspace lives. Pour, kip is desperately trying to force his digital friendship into the meat space world by taking his laptop to the movies for the argument in favor of cultivation of an online brand is as simple as it is daunting, although it may not be as authentic as the quote unquote real you, your profile, your cyber influenced cast a much wider net than you do alone. So whatever will you do with all of that incredible power. Hey, here's an idea from your very close friends at wisecrack. Thanks for watching guys.
