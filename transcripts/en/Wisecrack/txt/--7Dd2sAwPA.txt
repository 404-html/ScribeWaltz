Speaker 1:          00:04          There is a rapid rise in the demand for new skills. In fact, we see that at the individual levels and we see this at aggregate levels. Uh, there's a growing gap between the employment and labor market prospects of people who are highly skilled and people at the lower end of the skill spectrum skills determine more and more how the benefits of economic growth I shat in society. So success of companies today depends on nothing more than on the talent pool which they recruit. 70% of productivity gains have been bay basically driven by improvements in the skill base. So there is a dramatically a rising demand for better skilled people. At the very same time we also see that uh, in some countries there are many graduates unemployed on the street while employers say they cannot find the people with the skills they need. So there is a emerging mismatch between the kind of talent that is being developed and the talent that is really needed.

Speaker 1:          01:03          Tech. One of the things that our data show us that some of the scales that are easiest to teach and easiest to test are also the kind of skill set are easiest to digitize, automate and outsource. Sort of. That's a big challenge for, for the Education Industry today to think about, you know, what are they kind of 21st century skills that will enable people. You know, in the past you could assume as a teacher you will teach someone for the lifetime. You know what you learn in school. It's going to last for many, many years. Today there's no longer the case today. We need to educate people for jobs that have not been created, to use technologies that haven't been invented to solve social and economic problems that we don't have any idea I want to arise. This is sort of the fundamental challenge for education and that requires a very different caliber of teachers, teachers who are not just reproducing sort of or educating the reproduction of subject matter content, but it help young people to extrapolate from what they know to use and apply their knowledge in novel situations.

Speaker 1:          02:07          In a nutshell, the world economy no longer pays you for what you know. Google knows everything. The world economy piece you for what you can do with what you know in that requires a very different caliber of teachers, a very different pedagogy. 21st century Podagra be a very different relationship between teachers and students. Technology is part of this today. It's hard to explain why you should accept the teacher next door if you can have access to the world's best knowledge anymore. We're seeing in an unbundling of educational content, educational delivery, and accreditation with people anywhere drawing on the world's best knowledge at any time. We are seeing governments putting greater emphasis on evaluating outcomes on quality assurance, on setting standards, and the business sector actually being a lot more engaged in helping education systems. Figuring out, you know, where his labor demand evolving, what are the kinds of skills that will be there at a premium tomorrow. The business sector playing a very important role in as an education provider, engaging actively in the design and delivery of instructional system, providing educational and learning opportunities for people in many, many contexts. At least we're seeing this in some countries. It's in others. It's still a big challenge.
