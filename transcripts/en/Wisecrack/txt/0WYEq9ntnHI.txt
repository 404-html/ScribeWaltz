Speaker 1:          00:05          The original impulse behind the book was a recognition I've had. There are very many people who don't really enjoy what they do or perhaps in how they live. They don't enjoy the work they do and they sort of tolerate it, you know, they got through the week and they wait for the weekend. Was a lot of evidence of that. By that. I love it. Studies have shown that's massive disengagement at the workplace and yet I also meet people who love what they do and they couldn't really imagine doing anything else. If you said to them, why don't you do something else for a change, they really wouldn't know what you meant to say, but this isn't what I do. It's it's who I am and they couldn't be veterinarians, pathologists, they could be dancers, musicians, they could be teachers, homemakers, you name it. If you can think of a human activity or occupation, there'll be people who love it and live for it and others who couldn't bear it.

Speaker 1:          00:55          So I was just always intrigued by the difference between these two ways of being and the difference it makes. I think it has really considered the implications. It has implications that are social and character. You know, if we have communities where launch trenches of the population of simply detach this engaged and interested. Of course it has big consequences if people are disengaged at work. It has large consequences. Now, I'm not suggesting for a minute that if every finds that relevant, it will solve every social problem we face, but I'm certainly saying it would help and my longterm convictions always be in that we all have the talents and the potential for engagement and we should explore it. I have fallen into using the phrase the other climate crisis and I think it has a residence. What I mean by it is that we've become used to the fact now at least I hope we have.

Speaker 1:          01:51          That is a crisis in the world's natural resources, but I also think there is a crisis in our human resources and how we use them. And one of the themes of the book is to make an analogy between the natural world and and the way our lives operating. And we tend to think that we were persuaded ourselves because we live in cities like New York or la or wherever they were, somehow independent of nature. And of course we're not where organic creatures we live and we die and we, uh, we're subject to the own season, the seasons of our own lives, and just like the earth, it seems to me, human resources often buried deep beneath the surface. You can spend your whole life completely oblivious to some talent you may have because the opportunity never showed up for you to discover it or to develop it. So that's the broad aim of the book, is to dig down more deeply into what it means to be in your element, but also the book is really focused on providing some practical support, health and exercises. Then if that's the journey that your interest in taking for yourself or for people who know and love your children or people you work with, then I hope you'll stay
