Speaker 1:          00:03          Have you ever won some asshole who needs a haircut here? We just got back from deadpool two and one of the shares. Some thoughts. Is it funny? Yes. Is it the same thing as deadpool one except replace romance with family also? Yes, but there's one particular scene we wanted to talk about it just for for Logan, but deadpool two spoils logan pretty much immediately, so consider yourself warned. At the beginning of the film, deadpool holds a music box of Wolverine from the end of Logan. It depicts him impaled upon a tree. After defeating x 24, he laments that Logan has stolen his fire, so to make it right, dead pool will also die. Deadpool's Hugh Jackman obsession is well documented, but in deadpool two, it takes on a new layer of relevance. One can view the entire film as one giant joke at Logan's expense. So welcome to this wise crack quick take on deadpool two, and of course spoilers ahead, but first, quick shout out to Wix for sponsoring.

Speaker 1:          01:44          So first a quick recap. Deadpool two follows the MERC with a mouth as he's going through a bit of an emo phase. His plans to start a family with Vanessa Goto when she gets murdered by some bad guys after trying to kill himself, he's brought on as an x men trainee. Where he encounters a rotund young firestarter named Russell, tired of being abused by his boarding school staff. Russell starts lashing out. Deadpool decides to dish out some vigilante justice on his abusers, so he, along with Russell, end up in Buton prison with power inhibiting collars. Deadpool breaks free when the time traveling cable infiltrates the prison to assassinate Russell. Why? Because it grows up to be a pretty big who kills cables, wife and child. After playing some cat and mouse russell for sakes, deadpool to join up with the juggernaut and kill his school master causing deadpool and cable to team up as part of their deal.

Speaker 1:          02:38          Deadpool gets to try to stop Russell from killing his schoolmaster. Thus breaking the chain of events that turns him into key. We voldemort if not cable, gets to kill him. When you put the two film side by side, deadpool two is a lot like logan. Besides the healing factor, both films follow two mutants, trying to help younger mutants being hunted down by guys. It's also worth noting that both of these bad guys have robo arms slash hands. Both films also have an adult child relationship. Where the child is kind of a mirror for the protagonist, Wade Wilson had a crappy family life which makes him empathetic to the orphans Russell, who's only father figure conducts cruel experiments on him. As a result, he realizes Russell's and is beyond the child's choice and thus he deserves a chance. Similarly, Logan sympathizes with Laura because she like him, was engineered as a killing machine.

Speaker 1:          03:32          Both our heroes Die Sorta to save said child. So here's the thing in logan and his sacrifice has a particular meaning, one that we've covered before Logan and not set aside his violent past. No matter how hard he tries, he tries to spare laura the violent life he had, but can only do so by reluctantly becoming one last time. The animal like Wolverine Logan and his Wolverine Fur Sona die so that Laura may live. This may sound a lot like Vanessa's line. Give us a chance to be better than you used to be about how children give people the opportunity to make better versions of themselves and on the surface, this is kind of happening, at least in a, did poorly in way deadpool. Who has a violent past like wolverine does not want Russell to get that initial taste of murder because it will set him down a dark path.

Speaker 1:          04:23          Now, does deadpool want Russell to avoid being a jaded hitman for higher? Well, not exactly. He has to make sure Russell doesn't kill his school master, but he seems to have no problem doing the killing himself. I mean, this is deadpool. After all, at the end of the film, we think deadpool has turned a new leaf and decided to spare the school master and perhaps take colossus words to heart from early in the film that he's not judge, jury and executioner, and with deadpool sparing of him, Hey, it's progress, but it was all a stall tactic so that depender could make like daisy Buchanan and commit some light vehicular manslaughter. Just like the end of deadpool one. Wade is still not. Colossus is image of heroics, but perhaps this comparison works on another level. It Logan is about sparing a younger generation, the violence of their elders. Then deadpool two maybe about spearing a younger generation, the cynicism of their elders.

Speaker 1:          05:17          The idea that deadpool is cynical is pretty captain obvious, inhabits all the tropes of a superhero wild, mocking them. He shamelessly advertises but does so in a self deprecating style that makes it palatable. In one instance, Tequila ads had poorly plaster deadpool faces on them that we're an actual partnership. He also, above all else, refuses to take anything seriously including his own torture. If deadpool, the character is so cynical, so willing to trivialize everything, perhaps it's because he never really had a family. This negative part of his character manifests itself and heightens the conflict when he belittles Russell within earshot and claims not to care about him, and if this ill fitting role model has also abandoned Russell, why should Russell think anyone could love him? At the end of the film, deadpool approaches Russell and embraces him to try to stop his pyromania spree, but Russell doesn't buy it, and why should he?

Speaker 1:          06:15          All the adults in his life have been assholes. The implication is because Russell doesn't trust anyone because he's never had a family. He is without hope, but when cable tries to shoot him dead, pool takes the void proving to Russell that someone cares. Not only does this mean he doesn't have to grow up and killed hundreds of people, but that he should allow himself to trust others. Logan died so that Laura could give up violence and have a good life with her. New x family and deadpool died so russell could give up cynicism and embrace his new x family. Logan will never not be violent and deadpool will never not be cynical, but that doesn't mean we can't try to help the children. But again, this movie is a kind of extended joke on Logan. Although deadpool has healed the cynicism of Russell, the film still takes the opposite approach rather than a sad heartfelt ending.

Speaker 1:          07:09          Deadpool doesn't actually die, and the bait and switch with deadpool sparing the school master as a ruse to let dope hinder kill him. It's just proof of this cynicism. So where we expect progress, we find none. And if we had any doubts, the after credit scenes show deadpool making the entire first act irrelevant. And also shooting the old deadpool in the head, so although deadpool may have saved Russell from these cynical belief in not being able to trust anyone, the franchise itself is still as cynical as ever. And I'm sure commercials like this and this will never go away, but what do I know? I'm just some asshole with a youtube channel.
