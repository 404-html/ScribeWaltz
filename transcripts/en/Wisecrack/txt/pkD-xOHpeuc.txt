Speaker 1:          00:03          Hey wisecrack jared here, and we've got a special quick take to prime you guys for the release of blade runner 2049. As you might guess, we're big fans of the original blade runner and are super excited to see how the sql not only continues the plot, but develops the themes that made the original so legendary to wet our appetite. Even more crunchy roll has a first look on a 15 minute blade runner, animate directed by cowboy bebop. Mega director Shin is Watson Nabi that bridges the original and the sequel, and it's actually really good. Not only does it carry on the same visual style and the Neos, Anwar pitch black tone, but it reflects on many of the same themes and symbols present in the original. So big thanks to crunch roll role for giving us an exclusive sneak peek at the short and making this video possible.

Speaker 1:          00:50          Blade runner is a really dense, profound film full of symbols that also make an appearance in blackout 2022. So let's unpack how these symbols give us a better understanding of what it means to be human and perhaps derive a sense of what we can expect from blade runner. Twenty, 49. Welcome to this wisecrack quick take on blade runner and blackout 20 slash 22 and heads up. This discussion will spoil some key plot points of the anime. So if you want to watch it right now for free, had you crunchy roll.com/wise crack. So let's get to first a quick recap of blackout 2022 to replicants Trixie and ag go on a mission to destroy a database that holds a registry of all replicants on earth. One of the primary themes of the original is interrogating the line between human and Automaton, both blade runner and blackout 20. To explore this dynamic using three key symbols, the eye, the doll, and the dove. Number one on the original blade runner places, significant emphasis on eyes. The void contest examines eyes to detect if someone is a replicant or not. Roy and Leon meet the designer of their own eyes, and Roy even kills his own maker by giving him an extreme bits of Iq puncture. Similarly in blackout, the characters right eyes are coated with a mark, identifying them as replicants Bi is also relevant and how replicants and humans define themselves through images and symbols.

Speaker 1:          02:20          For example, the replicant Leon is obsessed with finding photos because these visual symbols reinforced the idea that he has a history proof of having existed. There's actually a pretty interesting postmodern commentary here. Many philosophers, including wisecrack favorite genre, beaudry yard, have discussed how all of us now think of our past as a series of images, photo albums, instagram, facebook, photos, et cetera. Our Past, like the replicants, has just become a series of photos, symbols, or video images. Similarly, the main drive of the protagonists in blackout to destroy a database registry that lists them as replicants. By removing these signs that defined them as not human, they are destroying the one thing, separating them from humanity. Number two, the dol in blade runner, Chris, a pleasure model, just like trixie disguises herself. It's a doll amongst other nonsense toys, while in blackout 20 slash 22, trixie carries a stuffed doll.

Speaker 1:          03:20          In both cases, the dol indicates how humans distinguish themselves from replicants. They're largely considered to be doll like lifeless Automaton, but why? Philosopher David Hume argues that the only thing that distinguishes us from dolls is our experience. He says that mankind is nothing but a bundle or collection of different perceptions. This bundle theory says that all we are is just a collection of experiences and memories held together in a sack of meat, and this is how we define ourselves as human, but as the film points out replicants to find themselves in the same way, even though her memories are artificially implanted, Rachel is convinced of her own humanity and even carries a photo of herself as a child. Implanted or not. If you have memories, what's the difference? Utilizing their experience, both trixie and Chris Challenged, they're prescribed faked shedding this idea of the doll and asserting their humanity.

Speaker 1:          04:17          This is why trixie leaves her doll behind as she goes into ass whooping. So who is to say they're just lifeless dolls? Number three, the dump, the final symbol has caused so much debate since the release of the original blade runner and its appearance in 20 slash 22 makes it all the more significant in the original movie Roy, he gives his famous speech while holding a dove and releases it just as he expires. Similarly in 2022, trixie observes a dub as she sails through the air before coming to a crashing end herself because of how briefly the doves are seen and importantly when they are seeing, it's easy to interpret them in a number of ways as a symbol of life departing or alternatively as life continuing or even as just another Automaton, as blade runner suggests, most organic animals no longer exist if you like our own

Speaker 1:          05:11          sort official. Of course it is. However, our favorite interpretation of the dove is that it represents a certain kind of freedom. The sort of freedom the characters yearn for can be found in what soren kierkegaard refers to as despair. Kierkegaard defines despair is the tension between life and are inevitable death and the search for meaning they're in. While for Keaker Guard, this was solved by aligning yourself with God for the replicants, no heaven or hell before us. This world is all gone, so like a lot of people living in are more secular age. We free ourselves from this tension or despair by being conscious of that understanding and defining ourself, which is exactly the replicants do. Roy spends the film fighting this tension by searching for more life beyond his four year expiration date and tell when he feels his body beginning to degrade and his end is near. He chooses to fight his programming as a combat model and spares deckerd. He then delivers this speech that brings tears to the eyes of nerds everywhere.

Speaker 2:          06:17          Oh, the moment will be lost in time, like tears, right,

Speaker 1:          06:33          referring to the bundle of experiences that he has seen throughout his life. Perhaps this indicates that he has finally defied his programming by defining himself and thus is free of his existential despair, even if he didn't get more life. Unlike in the original movie, Trixie and Iggy are seeking the power to allow them to define themselves by destroying the registry that the humans use to define them as replicants. In doing this, we see trixie breakaway from her programming as a pleasure doll and become a backflipping baptist, thus liberating herself from her predetermined role. In both cases, freedom must be fought for and claimed. If a 15 minute prologue by the same studio can pack all this sexy stuff than 20, $49. Sounds pretty promising and we didn't even get into the whole is decorative replicant debate, but that's going to have to wait for another time.
