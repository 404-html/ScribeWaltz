Speaker 1:          00:02          A wise crack jared irl, again, for those pumping in for the first time, this is still an experiment where we quickly respond to developments in TV and film as they happen, not just rick and Morty, so if you like them or have a request, let us know the indicators. Three return of the world enter was a pretty awesome job at marvel. Movies with the vindicator is acting as an obvious stand in for the avengers and rick acting as a mouthpiece for people disillusioned with the rather formulaic state of popular cinema or the writers have their own press releases. Morning, there are a bunch of drama queens and spend an hour talking at 20 minutes. Jumping around. We'll ship blows up there. A phase. We did one, it was the big event at at summer, let it die, but instead of focusing on Rick's beef with our Disney overlords, we're going to set our sights a little higher today.

Speaker 1:          00:46          Superhero films have been clumsy, grasping with the concepts of good knievel for what seems like an eternity, and this episode of Rick and morty comments on this and some pretty clever and even profound ways working on this wise crack. Quick take on vindicator three, the return over the world, and you guessed it, spoilers. First, a recap or he gets to choose the next adventure with Rick, so he decides to spend it with his heroes. The indicators in good Sanchez, he and fashion rick gets blackout drunk, destroys the ominous world under with little effort and traps the indicators in a series of trials that ruins them. The real art of indicators. Three, like another morty adventure we know is more these optimistic worldview crumbling around him. In the case of me and destroy mortise wholesome view of fairytales erodes as the genre is subverted.

Speaker 1:          01:38          In this episode, mortise faith in the indicators are roads as the superhero genre is a burden, but beneath all the vendors and superhero jokes. So your origin is what you fell into a vat of redundancy. This episode is also about the complexities of good and evil. I'd like some adventures where mortise view of the world is shattered. Rick plays a unique role in making his worldview. You disintegrate here after killing world under while blackout drunk, rick creates a saw inspired puzzle that is less a thought out plan to make people confront their demons, all La Jigsaw and more a drunk and scheme to push people over a moral cliff and it works. Vance shows his true colors. You're the learning disabled kid. New Photo APP, Dwayne. Okay, but this is triggering me. I need space. I need space from a million ants, kills Alan rails over. A woman and crocky bought.

Speaker 1:          02:29          Brings out the indicators. Little secret. What happened on Dorian five? Nothing. Nothing. We exterminated up planted by the end. Rick gets to Lord over morty about the sham. That is heroism. I appreciate it. Marty. I know you were sucking the Koolaid out of the indicators, so the fact that I was right about that must be pretty hard to admit. Yeah, it is. What's really clever about this episode is how they draw from some of the more unique villains and popular cinema. Brick is, is this a saw thing? Are you seriously sodding the syndicators 40. I'm a drunk, not a hack. Unlike most antagonistic jigsaw isn't about senseless murder or financial game. He wants to change people's paradigms by making them endorse suffering in some cases to make them appreciate life more. Similarly drunk. Rick's trials aren't meant primarily to eradicate the indicators, but rather to create a moral crisis for them approving to morty that they are not heroes.

Speaker 1:          03:21          Every one in the universe is a hero. Mom, which is why we don't need jackets and I'm pretty sure we don't need vindicator. Now. I thought this was pretty cool in itself, but what I thought really elevated this episode was a less obvious inspiration. The joker mortise trip in the carnival ride seems inspired by Alan Moore's, the killing joke. When Commissioner Gordon is tortured by the joker like Jigsaw, the joker isn't only motivated by murder. He's out to prove that with one sufficiently bad day or could become just as mad as him as another joker. Inspired by the killing joke puts it. See Madness, as you know, is like gravity. All it takes is a little push and what is Rick's shenanigans in this episode, but to push the vindicator to lose, they're just, as the joker infects the once idealistic harvey with his nihilistic philosophy by killing Rachel and turning corrupt cops against him.

Speaker 1:          04:16          So too does rick turn the benevolent indicators into violent backstabbers? Thus appending morty simplistic understanding of good and evil. Oh, I dunno. You managed to destroyed just about everything today. The villains, the heroes, the lines between them. My childhood. Thank you. Okay, so rick doesn't really buy that. Heroes are good, but there's a larger point about how the way were spoonfed narratives of good and evil is actually super bad. You know, narratives like this one, everyone in the universe is a hero. All you have to do is know the difference between good and bad and root for good, but thinking in such simple terms can lead to problems. For philosopher Jacques Ron Sierra, the problem with evil, with a big capital eat, you know the kind in every single superhero movie is there any kind of conflict becomes the ultimate struggle of good and evil. The value of winning that battle becomes well, infinite.

Speaker 1:          05:08          It's a fight for the soul of the world or galaxy or universe, all or nothing, so people can do even be worse in the world to achieve victory, but as the logic goes, isn't a justified what's so bad about letting a few thousand people die if it means destroying ultimate evil? Well, oh, what happened on Dorian five? Nothing. Nothing. We exterminated a planet. Wait, huh? Do Nama? Tron was hiding there. He's a shape shifter. Destroying Dorian five was the only way to kill him. I could have made you a device to detect. Do Nama metronic from orbit like that. What does this say about the syndicators? To summarize the problem with infinite evil, whether in the form of world destroyers or mortal humans is they weren't infinite justice. The kind that doesn't really care about morals or people of Dorian five and often even loses sight of the justice part by the end of the episode, Supernova has also been infected with Rick's nihilistic philosophy no longer believing in a real division between good and evil.

Speaker 1:          06:09          However, she recognizes the simplistic division must be upheld. It's like you said, there's no right or wrong. I never said that. The galaxies faith in the vindicator that keeps the galaxy secure. She's willing to kill Rick and Morty and even her lover to protect the perception that the indicators are good. It's not their actions that matter. It's the galaxies faith in their actions. That does. I'm pretty sure. This is another shout out to the dark knight, which is probably the best example of moral grayness in a comic book movie where Batman lies about the goodness of Harvey Dent to maintain peace in order in Gotham, supernova wants the galaxy to believe in a similar lie about herself. In both cases, people are advocating for a noble lie. The idea that societies can be built on a myth that maintains order. An idea made famous by the Greek philosopher Plato and it's not the first time rick and morty has made this kind of dark. Knight asked Noble Lie, shout out. We found it inside a lockbox box. Inside King Jellybeans closet. We have to tell the people, wait, destroy it,

Speaker 1:          07:20          or people will get more from the idea. He represented from the Jelly Bean, he actually was. Now, this is kind of philosophy 101, but it's worth noting at least because of its relation to the dark knight, but where the dark knight kind of celebrates the slide. Rick and morty uses it to deconstruct the myths of superheroes. Rick says good and bad are artificial constructs. Yeah, well, I get the feeling he kind of needs that to be the case. However, rather than just deconstructing good and evil as arbitrary concepts, which by the way it's done before. I mean seriously, I may be the devil, but your grandpa is the devil. Show was also suggesting that the complete absence of these concepts isn't so great either. This is a clever call back to the last episode where Dr Wong Confronts Rick in saying, only connection between your unquestionable intelligence and the sickness destroying your family is that everyone in your family, you've included use intelligence to justify sickness.

Speaker 1:          08:13          Whereas the vindicator fail to critically engaged with their methods or even their mission. Rick refuses to engage with his decisions for the exact opposite reason because nothing matters, and if nothing matters and good and evil or just social constructs, then he can't consider his actions evil. You can just continue doing whatever he wants, so the episode presents us with to differing perspectives regarding good knievel, both of which are in typical rick and morty fashion, completely dismal. We either have zero conviction of the division between good and evil, which leads rick to doing whatever he wants and it not mattering, or we have complete and utter conviction of what constitutes good and evil and people end up doing really messed up for the sake of good, like blow up an entire planet.
