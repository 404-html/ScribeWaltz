Speaker 1:          00:11          The thriller joy has, has some sort of a connection to just the idea of accomplishing something that is set out to do and on Wall Street that happens to be a big trade or a big deal. It could be creating a beautiful painting if you're an artist or a, a lovely ceramic, um, if, if you're, um, that kind of an artist or a sculptor and on Wall Street, the, the measure of sort of accomplishment and achievement aside from the bonus and the money that is attached to it is, is all of those little transactions that happen along the way. Um, and so there's a real connection of I'm talking to a client discussing a particular trade or a particular type of transaction that they should do going back and forth on meetings, going back and forth on phone calls, going back and forth on numbers.

Speaker 1:          01:00          And then like coming out of that with achieving this goal of, of closing that deal. Because there's also a lot of competition. So when one team from one company is trying to like a Morgan Stanley or Goldman Sachs or jp Morgan is talking to a corporation, say a coca cola or an alcove or, or whatever, everyone's competing. Um, it's not like Goldman is the only company talking to say Coca Cola or whatever on, on any given day, there's, there's a lot of teams and there's a lot of competition. So what comes out of that for people involved is, is the idea of having some help accomplish the deal and sort of beaten out of the competition. So it's all very, that's why it's such a very hyper competitive environment. And some people really continue to get a thrill out of that forever, um, or throughout their full careers and stay for a long time ago up a high chain and keep going. And some people didn't. And I was one of them think that's, you know, also quite empty because you're not actually creating anything. You're accomplishing a close of a deal perhaps what you're not actually creating anything real or contributing anything real. Um, and there's a real emptiness to that. So it, it, it, it goes both ways depending on really, I think the person.
