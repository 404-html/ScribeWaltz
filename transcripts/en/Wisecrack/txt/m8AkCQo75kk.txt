Speaker 1:          00:10          Greetings and welcome to earthlings cinema. I am your host Garrick's wormy Lloyd. This week's artifact is guardians of the Galaxy Vol, two starring sexy Labrador retriever, Chris Pratt and directed by a certified earthlings cinema Super Fan, James Gunn. We open on an unsolicited music video for electric. Light Orchestra is Mr Blue Sky, but shortly thereafter the movie begins. The space of Andrew's are added again. Only this time they're on autopilot because they're rolling in that squeak well money rocket steals a bunch of car batteries from a nearby mitis store, so the midas employees launch a full scale attack with their drone army. Fortunately, at giant hard boiled egg comes along and saves our heroes without even cracking a shell. The captain of the egg introduces himself as Eggo. Peter quills, long lost father and a healthy part of a balanced breakfast invites everyone back to his home planet for some extra syrup, but just the humanoid characters, the freaks have to stay behind in case someone shows up to kidnap them, which thankfully someone does.

Speaker 1:          01:11          It's Yon. Do a minor bad guy from the first one here to confuse everybody by snagging the primary emotional arc of the second one, he captures rocket, but almost immediately his crew mutinies for fear of getting their trash cans knocked over, or the crew doesn't account for his baby groot coming to the rescue with Vaudevillian slapstick. Meanwhile, Eggo reveals that he and his home planet are actually one and the same and that he's some kind of godlike celestial being a super ego, if you will. He explained that he took his Kurt Russell form in order to travel the universe and find meaning in his life. I either get laid, he does not explain why. A being who has been around for Millennia and projects is on appearance, would bother to age himself up after only 30 years. In any case, echo shows, Peter, that he has celestial powers to, such as the power to have a catch and the power to overanalyze earth media, one of earth's greatest musical compositions.

Speaker 1:          02:08          Perhaps it's very greatest. Yes. As if anyone had any interest in that unfortunately Eggo, then let slip that he planted seeds on thousands of planets in order to take them over, but one celestial isn't enough to activate them. He needs to celestial's. Why not just do it himself and only activate half the planets? You asked? Shut up. Peter starts going through his rebellious phase and stands up to his mean old dad. Soon. All the other space avengers join in on the fund and rock. It makes a bomb using those batteries from the beginning. Full circle baby. They burn to a crisp and yon do sacrifices himself to prove some point or another. Then there's just enough time for the movie to set the Guinness Beer record for most post credit scene guardians of the galaxy volume two as an Ode to daddy issues and all their various forms, especially the form that leads to lower back tattoos.

Speaker 1:          03:06          Oh, of course. I have issues per Dr. Sigman Floyd, the heavyweight champion of psychoanalysis. The childhood need for a father's protection plays a crucial role in shaping the human psyche. Even if the shape of that psyche ends up being a primitive, a morphous Blob, Peter has spent his whole life yearning for the father who abandoned him with nothing more than an ab roller at a tub of protein powder, Gomorrah and nebulous father thanos forced them to fight each other, destroying the family bond as well as nebulous skin to metal ratio. Every time my sister prevailed, my father would replace a piece of machinery rocket. Never even had any parents to begin with, which could be why he never learned to shave.

Speaker 2:          03:49          I know them. Scientists. What made you never gave a rat's ass about serious? My own damn parents who saw me, faith in the slavery, a character

Speaker 1:          04:00          attempt to overcome their respective daddy issues by turning into helio copter, parents of their collective child, baby groot. We're going to need to have a real discussion about your language. When we meet ego, he's draped in long lost father tropes from the cliche game of catch to having a beard, but we soon learned that Eggos motivations are less about fatherhood and more about taking over the known universe, which is not how most father showed their love. Karen's Dad, this is a radical inflation of ethicists, henry the Henry Nader Sedgwick's concept of ethical egoism, which states that one ought to act only out of self interest in order to maximize their own pleasure eggos. Self absorption is so crest complete that all other life pales in comparison. I told you how all those years ago I had an unceasing impulse to find life, but what I did not tell you, this is how when I finally did find it was also disappointing.

Speaker 1:          04:59          Hey, you and me both bow. The antithesis to Eggos philosophy is altruism didn't realize your motivation was altruism. A term invented by French philosopher Auguste, the Henry Nader comped that suggests man has a moral obligation to live for others. One need look no further than the name guardians of the galaxy vol. Two, to detect this idea as the word guardian implies a duty to protect others and fall to implies a cynical view of the movie going. Public Echo tries to inflate Peter's pride, we've heard tell about the man they call star Lord and tempt him with weird poetry. Death will remain a stranger to both of us as long as the light burns within the planet, but the Guardian's vanquish Eggo instead proving once and for all that altruism triumphs over selfishness well twice and for all, since they pretty much did the same thing at the end of all, one for earthlink cinema, I am groot.
