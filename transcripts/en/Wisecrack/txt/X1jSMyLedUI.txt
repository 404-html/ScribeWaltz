Speaker 1:          00:00          This video is brought to you by skillshare. Hey, wisecrack. Jerod here. Today we're talking about the movie that made Batman v Superman look like an art house masterpiece. Justice League.

Speaker 1:          00:14          God, I wish it was that one. Okay. Technically superfriends, but still better than justice league. Yeah, that's the one. So full disclosure, justice league is not good. It's trite Aif I believe in truth, but I'm also a big fan of justice and yeah, if that line didn't tip you off, they also totally botched superman. Worst of all, the film neutered all the thematic ambitions of its predecessor throwing these superman as Christ metaphor into the trash, but beneath all these flaws, there's one central issue that makes Justice League so forgettable after subjecting ourselves to all 121 minutes of this film over and over again. Seriously, I think I've seen it like five times. We think the film's main failure comes from its inability to juggle two things, advancing the main conflict with steppenwolf and introducing us to our new Palette of characters while in a better film.

Speaker 1:          01:05          These two aspects would work in concert with each other in justice league. It's the complete opposite. Every time we have backstory or character development, it seems to come at the expense of the main story to understand how this is even possible, though we first need to understand one fundamental lesson in screenwriting, dramatic action, motionless, wisecrack condition on the Justice League. What went wrong, and yeah, if you can spoil a Turd, spoilers for justice league ahead. Also Batman v Superman and infinity ward. But first a quick recap. Justice League takes place in a world without superman. After the man of steel was killed by Doomsday Bruce. Wayne is racked by guilt. Well supposedly, but bruce doesn't have much time to dwell on this because a new world ending threat is knocking on earth store in the form

Speaker 2:          01:53          of the end of worlds can only to

Speaker 1:          01:59          wants to turn earth into a hellscape, but to do so, he'll need to reclaim the mother boxes. Essentially dcs version of the Infinity Stones, which were reactivated by Superman's death. These boxes have been guarded by the ancient tribes of Amazon's Atlanteans and men for centuries, but now that steppenwolf is back, that man has to rally the old alliance and build a crack team to stop it. You got familiar favorites like Bruce Wayne and Diana Prince, along with a sheldon cooper inspired flash, a Dothraki Aquaman, and a CGI Cyborg. So what is dramatic action? While the term applies to all dramatic writing, playwright David Edgar summed it up best in his book. How plays work by defining it as a project followed by a contradiction. Now I know that sounds like a Russian nesting doll of terms, so let's break it down by a project. Edgar means more or less a goal usually stated with a subject, verb and object.

Speaker 1:          02:53          So for example, when Batman tries to bribe in Icelandic village into helping him find aqua man, I'll give you 20,000 to talk to this man right now. We get state the project as that man looks for Aquaman. Subject, verb object. Pretty simple, right? But Batman and Aquaman can't be besties right off the bat. Otherwise, there'd be no conflict in that rotten tomatoes score would slide even further. That's where Edgar's idea of the contradiction comes in. Typically our heroes don't get what they want in a scene. They run into the contradiction or more simply obstacles. As it turns out, for Bruce, aqua man doesn't want to play nice with friends. By comes, we'll need you. Don't count on a bad man. Why not? Because I want to keep coming here digging into my business, getting into my life to Ed Group. The best way to express the contradiction is a basic statement, so if we were to put the project and contradiction together for this scene, we get something like this.

Speaker 1:          03:47          Batman looks for Aquaman, but Aquaman is a dick. Now, the reason why dramatic action is such a big deal is that in advance is conflict. Characters make certain choices in the pursuit of their goals only for new obstacles to pop up in response to these choices. Because the contradiction always gets in the way of the project, no scene should end. On the same note, it began just look at Batman who after being scorned by aqua man wonders if he lost him forever. So you're saying you have no way of reconnecting with this tracking device in his he left without it. This is what screenwriting Guru Robert Mckee means when he says that a scene must turn in his book story Mckee Rights. If the value charged condition of the character's life stays unchanged from one end of a scene to the other, nothing meaningful happens. The scene has activity talking about this, doing that, but nothing changes in value.

Speaker 1:          04:43          It is a non event. It's that last point that's relevant without dramatic action conflict in advance and the scene won't turn. And this is where justice league seriously screws up. While most of the scenes do have dramatic action and do turn they do so by focusing on our heroes, individual arcs at the expense of the conflict. And even though scenes turn it's done in a way that's hasty and ungratifying. Let's look at aquaman again. Following the mother box being stolen from Atlantis, we see him, shrug it off. The project of this scene would be, aquaman wants to abandon Atlantis and that makes sense based on the character we saw earlier, a man who's only allegiance is to himself, strong man, a strong as alone. You ever heard that saying, that's the opposite of what they're saying, but then comes the contradiction and tell me if you see a problem here. Your mother left you to save your life.

Speaker 2:          05:39          Karen, imagine how much it costs,

Speaker 1:          05:45          but you're not a defenseless child. Now it would have been her responsibility to follow that monster to the surface and stop him.

Speaker 2:          05:55          No, it's

Speaker 1:          05:58          yours. Yeah, so that character, we have no idea who she is and that backstory yet never hinted at. So while sure there is a contradiction, we could express it as, but some brando convinces aquaman to stay. It feels cheap, like a purely artificial inconvenient plot device, almost as cheap as another poor dce. You turn eight Dsx Martha, if you will. As it turns out, this isn't the only time justice league seems to cheat when it comes to dramatic action in our character scenes. He's got to prove our point. Let's look at one of the most frustrating moments in the movie, the discussion to bring superman back to life. While we could talk about how the project of this scene, bruce argues to bring back superman defies the logic of its predecessor. He has the power to wipe out the entire human race and if we believe there's even a one percent chance that he is our enemy, we have to take it as an absolute certainty by concocting some weird pet cemetery debate.

Speaker 1:          06:57          We mean bring them back in like a Yay. He's back way, not in like a like a pet cemetery scenario. It's actually the contradiction that really gets us while bruce advocates for Superman's revival, he encounters his first obstacle in the form of Diana, who's worried about what happens if the plan fails. You're risking lives. There's and maybe comes this more. We don't have time for a control group. Is it a risk? Yes, but it's necessarily because of your guilt. Now, if this had you scratching your head, you're not alone because nowhere in the proceeding our did the film show a Bruce Wayne tormented by guilt, no flashbacks, no dreams, no coping mechanisms, and if you think we're being unduly harsh, then know that all of these were employed in Batman v Superman to explain bruises, extreme distrust for the man of steel. Just like with Aquaman, the scene has dramatic action and yes it turns, but only through artificially inserted conflict. Unsurprisingly, there are some pretty big consequences for making so much of the dramatic action focus on our heroes, very thin, personal and interpersonal arcs. In fact, the film is so preoccupied with rushing to set up our characters and their own foibles like flashes, social awkwardness, aquaman's, lone cop persona, sideboard, self hatred, and Diana's isolation from the world that it's seemingly forget steppenwolf altogether. Case in point. Consider the mother boxes. You know these

Speaker 3:          08:22          carried from planet to planet. The mother boxes combined to form the unity and apocalyptic power that not only destroys world transforms them into the primordial hellscape of steppenwolf spirit world.

Speaker 1:          08:37          Well, it might surprise you to learn that Batman, arguably the protagonist of the film only learns that the box is important at the 30 minute mark, but surely the rest of the film and our heroes are focused on keeping the boxes from steppenwolf's poorly CGI hands, right? Yeah. No, the first box is stolen from amazons without any of our heroes present. The second one features a measly 32nd fight scene with Aquaman and just to rub it in how little our heroes care about the actual plot. The third and final mother box is basically stolen off screen while our team is recovering from a superman beat down another box. He has the last one. Now I know what you guys are thinking, jared, by assembling the team, the Justice League is stopping Steppenwolf and while there's definitely some merit to that idea, this shouldn't be an either or scenario to prove my point.

Speaker 1:          09:28          Let's look at another film with a very similar premise. Infinity war in the film fan is hellbent on destroying half of all life by gathering the infinity stones after Bruce Banner Escape Stenosis, grasping the opening scene, the whole enlist the help of Dr. Strange and Tony Stark. If he gets his hands on all $6, Dani, you can destroy life on a scale hither to on dreamtime. Importantly, you'll notice three things in the scene. One, our heroes get together and learn of the initial threat in under 15 minutes to our heroes, specifically strange envision possess infinity stones that puts them on a crash course with the plot and most importantly three our heroes. Personal problems are intermixed with the conversation to stop Banjos who just shaved your match glass me seriously. Don't know how you fit your head into that, how admit it. You should've ducked out when I told you to if it wasn't already obvious.

Speaker 1:          10:21          Stark and strange aren't exactly fond of each other, and the dramatic action of any given scene is as much about stopping fan ost as it is about learning to work together, but as the to continue to fight alongside each other. Their dysfunction goes from Tony, reluctantly rescuing strange. I got to tell you, he's not really my friend. Saving his life is more of a professional courtesy to strange bartering, the time stone away to save Tony's life, spare his life, and I will give you the stone. In this last instance, the dramatic action of the scene is equally about plot stopping banjos and character Tony and strangers relationship. The project is and wants to kill Tony and the contradiction is but strange stops him by giving away the time stone and to be honest, this moment resonated. Now we'd be wrong to say that this kind of interplay between our heroes, personal conflict and the actual plot is absent in justice league, but we'd also be wrong to say that it's similar in terms of quality or scale.

Speaker 1:          11:21          Let's look at the flash for example. While the film makes a point of showing his desperate need for friends, I need friends. This conflict doesn't really manifest itself anywhere else in the film, let alone in a confrontation with steppenwolf. The closest we have to it is this. It's really cool. You guys see ready to do battle and stuff, but in full transparency, I've never done battle. Yes, the dramatic action to the sequence could be stated as clashes, scared to enter the frig and Steppenwolf, but Batman convinces him, but we have to ask at what part of the movie did indicate to us that he had combat stagefright. Ultimately, this scene feels like a tenuous tie in between Barry's personal struggles and stopping the world ending threat and the film treats it as such. After the flash rescue, the hostages, the film conveniently forgets any of his stage fright.

Speaker 1:          12:10          Gross. As a result, these scenes often fail to evoke the hallmark of good writing, aristotle's idea of catharsis or the purification or projection of emotions primarily through art. Because Justice League fails to properly tether our character's personal journeys to the action of the plot. We don't feel the proper emotions. Anxiety, fear relief. I have none of it washes over us. Sure. We see Diana and Cyborg. Finally coming out of hiding. We hear aqua man talk about friendship or regrets or something. I don't want to die. I'm young, but I want to do. I just feel like we're really embraced Fiordland I've been my whole life because these aren't developed and tied to the action of the plot. There's no catharsis. We as the audience just can't muster up the energy to care and we really can't emphasize this enough. This is exactly what infinity war excels at.

Speaker 1:          13:06          Consider the relationship between Tony Stark and Peter Parker, which is developed hand in hand with the main plot. More often than not, our duo find some subs bickering like father and son in the face of enemies. After all, Tony Wants Peter Safe. I know what you're going to say. You should not be here. I was going to go home. I don't want to hit it with such a long way down and I just thought about shooting. Now I got to hear this side of the ship and this shoot is ridiculous. The intuitive, by the way. So if anything, it's kind of your fault that I'm here. What did you do? Say I take that back and this relationship affects the action. Like when Tony plays hardball for Peter's life, when they're both mistaken for Santos, his henchmen. Tell me where the girl is, where I swear to you, I'm going to French fry, this little freak steward. Just shoot my gun on. Blessed him. Let's go. More importantly because we see Tony and Peter's dynamic grow and change over the course of the film. We're invested in them, which makes moments like this legitimately Cathartic

Speaker 1:          14:07          in contrast, all the resolution scenes of the Justice League characters feel obligatory and phoned in. It's the difference between feeling genuine emotion in the theater and leaving saying, well, I guess that was a movie in the end. Justice League stands as a case study of a film that feels to balance two very important things, character and plot, which I suppose makes sense when you consider how they had to establish all these new franchises for movies to come, but what do you guys think? Is dramatic action, the best lens to focus this problem or are there bigger issues lurking in the justice league?
