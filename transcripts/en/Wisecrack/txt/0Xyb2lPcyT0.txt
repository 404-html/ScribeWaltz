Speaker 1:          00:04          Good evening, my name is looking. My daughter and ever struggled, ballsy, so I'm sorry if I sound weird or look weird, but my question to you was on cold fusion, was it something that actually had married or was it something that the scientific community legitimately had reasons for abandoning your thoughts please.

Speaker 2:          00:23          Low key, low key, low key. You don't look that weird to us, sir. He looked fine about cold fusion, so here was the idea. There's a guy who really had the first patent on television was the mythic. This was really his name, Phylo Farnsworth, and it is said he told people that he had the idea for television by plowing his uncle's potato field as a as a kid and he looked at the way the the furrows went across the field and inferred. That would be a way to make a moving picture. That same guy got it in his head that he could make neutrons do whatever he wanted, like he had this one success and he got it in his head that he could influence neutrons and he created a device which he called a phaser and that that word has later been used to describe a rotating vectors in electrical and light waves and a heatwaves.

Speaker 2:          01:28          But, uh, this thing was going to enable neutrons to fuse together at room temperature. He was not able to do it. I mean this. In order to do that, as far as we can tell right now, you need the gravity of a star, which we have at our nearby star, the sun. And people have speculated that you could also contain fusion. Not speculated that's an exaggerated, that's a I'm shortchanging us. People have shown that you could contain fusion in May, in a magnetic field, a very, very strong magnetic field, but no one has been able to build a magnetic field powered by the fusion reaction. That makes the fusion reaction makes enough power to, to establish the magnetic field is strong enough to hold it so that everyone, in my experience growing up, it's always 40 years from now when this will be done. But, uh, recently, uh, an aircraft company, I guess it was Mcdonald Douglas claimed or yeah, Mcdonald's claimed that they'd be able to make fusion happen at room temperature.

Speaker 2:          02:39          I'm very skeptical because they look at what happens in nature with these stars, but it's so far cold fusion was a myth. Now then about 25 years ago, 1988, 1990 scientists at a, at a university in the State of Utah here in the US, thought they had established cold fusion, that they had established a magnetic field powered by the energy of the fusion that would contain the reaction, but they didn't. They had the thermometer in the wrong place on their lab equipment. And, uh, I cite this as an example of journalists who were not scientifically literate enough to question this. This result was published. Results are announced result and they just let the thing, the journalists let the things spiral out of control to the point where the story to the point where somebody like you 25 years later is asking essentially the same question, can we have fusion at room temperature? So as far as we know, no. However, it is reasonable that you will be alive when people really do figure it out. It's exciting. It's a very. It's a great question.
