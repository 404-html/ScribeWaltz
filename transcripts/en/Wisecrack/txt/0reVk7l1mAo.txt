Speaker 1:          00:00          Yo, this video sponsored by squarespace. Make your next move. God Damn Baby. This week on five milsuite jacket it with ready player, one by Ernest cline.

Speaker 2:          00:24          It's the year

Speaker 1:          00:24          20, 40 and Everett thing fucking sucks. I'm talking famine, poverty and energy. Crisis Up das was I could go home player to escape this whacked out world. Everybody live in a Vr game called the oasis. You can do anything up in here. Get your learn on hustle at a job by stuff, swank and bang, whatever everyone up on that daily grind. When the Creator, the oasis attempt bigger baller named James Halladay, takes that long dirt nap and drives a video message and all the players, brother say he hit an Easter egg, you know asis and the first cat naps. Three keys that are lots. It gets all this fat stacks Monday for the next five years. Homeys busting ass trying to find them keys and get on a big ass scoreboard. These pete's called gunters and they wild about the eighties and everything. Holiday ain't nobody finds July.

Speaker 1:          01:24          Eighteen year old narrator. Wait, step up and crack the first clue. See where they come from the hood, so he straight up sas. We're getting holidays, cash money's one day way chilling. In Latin class. We recognize the first key might be on this, his school planets, so homeboy teleport to the spot, shakes off some traps wreck shop at a mini game and hell yeah, he get decade. He tried to book it to the next box when he was into a famous painting named Artemis who weighed, been hot as balls dropped. Turns out she'd been trying to beat that mini game for weeks, but just can't hack it. Wait, give her a tip on a low and swings over to the next clue. Do. Besides through another mini game like a GE and opens up the first gate where he got to play. Matthew Broderick in that eighties movie war games.

Speaker 1:          02:16          That's my I did. Dealing with that mess. He gets the next clue soon enough where he got some company on that scoreboard arguments his homeboy age and two brothers named Dido and Shell toe on the come up. Some sites from a big ass corporation called Ili start blowing up Wade's inbox saying they want to meet these haters, a call sixers, and the only thing on their mind is making bank off the oasis way decided he wanted to meet the top dog Sorento who offers ways, some mad grants to stop playing for that team. When you say, Nah Bro, I'm straight, Sorento safe. They know where he lives and they're gonna. Blow it to hell. Since Wade's real body is in his hideout, he just shake that. Hey, the off then boom is up. These trailer go up in smoke and a bunch of innocents get to murked skirt is hell.

Speaker 1:          03:07          Wait, Holla at his homeys and when the timer what went down, they all wigged out so when he skips town and lays low by taking a new name while trying to crack the next clue, the simpsons try to isolate and he gets his wool on with Artemis, but probably moving a little too fairs, so artemis got to shut them down. Rookie move, wait a couple of months. Go by and ways doing what I call the post breakup. Hustle, work out, stay busy, and by size dog, what else do you need? He ain't no closer to finding a second key when out of nowhere are the it with a little help from age way connects the dots and books into a planet where he go hard at a game of PAC man and wins a quarter boy thing. This is a little Easter egg, so he pocketed wave slides over to another planet.

Speaker 1:          04:00          Takes down again and get that second key, so a good till they get word that the sixes ghosted Dido and real life man, that ain't good. Yo Sunni boosters, the third key and rolls over to the spot where the Easter egg going to be a whole gang of census. It's posted up right outside the castle so he comes up with the plan. I got by the police, Wade hats until the Ioi to boost some scandalous evidence, mess with their shield and then blows that joint. He hit up arguments shadow an h, telling them to bail because the Ili is looking to offer them in the real world. They all meet in the chat room and conversation about how they're going to take down the sixes. They need all the hoods and all waste is the crew up with them and this bike, so we sent out a message to everybody telling them when they gonna throw down why they plot holidays.

Speaker 1:          04:58          Pottnam la rose shows up in the chat room and say he been creeping on him. He sent everybody some slinky planes to Harlem to his credit when they ready to bang out and she'll veils and a bunch of gunters and 16 start scrapping. The six is drop a bomb. Cool. Everybody dies. Sab. Wait a little bit that courtney got. Turns out it wasn't extra life, so he keeps hassling. He wrecks another game and plays King, author in that movie with the coconuts after busting through some other challenges. He finally gets the East Egg holidays character shows up and say, yo, reality can be raw as hell, but it's the only place you can find happiness because reality is real. You feel me? So rental gets thrown in the clink and way, going to see as bad check with his homies. Then Wade and the Ottomans Hook up in the real world and finally kiss a year.

Speaker 1:          06:00          One thing that's always going on about it's escaping from the horrible bulls in your life. Everybody's lives are so funny that they all hold up inside a video game the game. Don't just give them a different world, but one that let people shine and live life on the easy. It ain't just people getting their marbles off by losing themselves in another world, but also by losing themselves in the past. Everybody in his book always geeked up about their eighties and shit from PAC man and a young matty be Nah. Not that one to monty python, but no run DMC, man. That's some bullshit. If your head always living in the past, how are you going to create new ideas? Man, he supposed to fully live. Truth is sometimes by trying to escape one trap, people actually end up creating another one. I've come to see my rig for what it was and elaborate contraption for receiving my census to allow me to live in a world that didn't exist.

Speaker 1:          06:59          Each component of my rig was a bar and the sale where I had willingly in prison myself in real life, I was nothing but an anti social hermit. I was just another sad, lost, lonely soul, wasted his life on a glorified video game. So it's this kind of future technology banging a busted. Well, on the one hand, they're always. His players can get all the knowledge they want. I'm talking free information, free schooling and the ability to compensate with homies all over the world, but on the other hand, if you don't check yourself, you could end up isolating yourself from any meaningful connections. So it's the always is a utopia or dystopia. Well, it'd be real. That ass ain't so easy. They'll always give Paul struggling folks access to education and jobs. Since there ain't none on the outside, but that also means that they are ignoring all the mess happening around them in the real world, which only makes that reality rock dish.

Speaker 1:          07:59          It's like there's a utopia or dystopia. You fill me in a real world way. They ain't got no friends, no benjamins and no respect, but in the oasis. Got a solid wrap, a nice cash flow, and a loyal crew. I mean, just check this one sec way jabbering about how horrible is things used to be awesome, but now they're kind of terrifying. Human civilization is in decline. Some people even say is collapsing. Then he started talking about his life like it's all tight and shit. Luckily I had access to the oasis, which was like having an escape hatch into a better reality. It was my playground and my preschool, a magical place where anything was possible. The Oasis is the setting of all my happiest Childhood Memories, so as escape the answer to living in a jacked up world, is it better to kick back and live a decent life and a fake world are be on the struggle.

Speaker 1:          08:53          In reality. Maybe we should time Kaphar reality and make it the place to be rather than just giving up and piece them out to somewhere else. I'm. It was reality.
