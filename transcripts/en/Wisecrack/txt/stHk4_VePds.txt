Speaker 1:          00:00          This video is brought to you by audible. Hey, was helen here? So jared is on vacation, which gives me the chance to tell you all about the philosophy of a show about philosophy. This could get meta. The good place is a fascinating piece of television because while it includes philosophy lessons as a major plot point, it also incorporates its own ideas on human nature, fate and ethics for a show us sensibly about teaching people to be good in the afterlife. The good place asks a more profound question, can those lessons actually make us better people and if they can, does that matter? Welcome to today's much requested episode on the philosophy of the good place. Spoilers ahead. Okay, so a recap for any uninitiated into the world of the good place. The premise of the first season is that coworker betraying senior scamming tequila slugging human garbage.

Speaker 1:          00:57          Eleanor Shell Strop dies and accidentally ends up in the good place. There's been a big mistake. I'm not supposed to be here, which is basically heaven, except without all the religion he stuff which we're laying makes it way, way more elitist. Only the very best to get into the good place based on an intense point system to determine exactly how good you are. You need me to lie to old people and scare them into buying fake allergy medicine. I get it, man. Which one's my desk? Even though eleanor probably doesn't belong in any religions, good place. The point system gets absurd.

Speaker 2:          01:30          Every single thing you did had an effect that rippled out over time and ultimately created some amount of good or bad.

Speaker 1:          01:39          She's joined in her paradise neighborhood by to honey, a beautiful, wealthy philanthropist. John, you a Buddhist monk and her supposedly soulmate Cheaty, a philosophy professor specializing in, you guessed it, ethics also. There's a lot of frozen yogurt. What is it with you and frozen yogurt? Have you not heard of ice?

Speaker 2:          01:58          Oh sure. That I've come to really like frozen yogurt. There's something so human about taking something great and ruining it a little so you can have more of it.

Speaker 1:          02:07          Oh, those are good place is supposed to be heaven for eleanor. Being surrounded by people who are better than her is actual hell. After eleanor tells Cidi her secret that she's there by mistake. He decides to teach her to be a good person by conjuring up a chalkboard and giving her daily philosophy lessons. This leads to some of the best philosophy jokes on television who died and left aristotle in charge of ethics play doll. Oh, and John, you is actually Jason, a trashy Florida, want to be dj who is also there by mistake. So he joins in on the ethics classes too. This is your first step towards not sucking.

Speaker 2:          02:42          Cool. I just have two questions. One or football tryouts, and does the school have a prom? Oh No.

Speaker 1:          02:51          For most of the show, eleanor's moral progress runs parallel to her ethics lessons. The more she internalizes philosophy, the more see her making decisions that are halfway decent, if not downright suite. The show at face value sets up the premise that learning ethics makes you act more ethically. At least that's the premise the cheeky and eleanor are working from as he goes through the grueling task of teaching contractual ism to someone who abandoned dog sitting duties to go to a rihanna concert. You broke your promise as soon as it wasn't convenient for you, and now I have a very full office dog. That idea that learning moral philosophy can make you a better person is an ethical theory in itself. The question of whether or not ethics can make you a better person and if so, what ethical system best accomplishes that is called Meta ethics.

Speaker 1:          03:42          Fundamentally, the good place is a show about Metta ethics even as it presents relatively straight forward ethical theories through cheeky and when cheeky teaches you ethics, he goes hard. Well, now that you've become acquainted with existential crises, I thought we could read death by philosopher Todd May. Sounds like the perfect beach read. Eleanor gets the rundown on rawls lock clout to Plato, Sidgwick Mill, hume, Scanlan, and quite a few other moral philosophers, including todd may, who just happens to be one of the philosophy consultants for the show. Nice one time. All of these competing philosophical concepts are meant to teach eleanor and Jason how to be moral enough to remain in the good place, but as any ethics, one o one student could tell you, learning a bunch of contradictory theories on what makes someone act good does not actually help answer the question, how the fork should I act?

Speaker 1:          04:32          Eleanor frequently expresses her frustration with this, but she keeps on selfish. Here's the perfect test. There's something fun that you want to do and then there's something less fun that people are doing for the common good from the beginning of the ethics lessons. These frustrations hint that the real question isn't which of these philosophers should I base my moral system on, but rather is this the right way to learn how to be ethical in the first place? After all, gds inability to decide anything driven by his thorough knowledge of philosophy is his main flaw. I miss my mom's back surgery because I had already promised my landlords nephew that I would help him figure out his new phone. I don't need the Cidi who once had a panic attack during rock paper, scissors because there were just too many variables. The show progresses. Eleanor becomes a decent person, CIDI gets slightly better at making decisions and Jason Gets married to a robot.

Speaker 1:          05:24          Oh, that's enough out of you. Robot lover. That's risk not a robot. We're still not sure if that last one has any secret moral significance. While you might say, hey, gds classes are helping. It could be argued that eleanor and friends are progressing in spite of his philosophy class. That's because there's a big difference between learning ethics and doing ethics and here's where we get back to Meta ethics. Those questions about what morality actually is and how we ought to approach it. There's actual data to support the idea that studying moral philosophy doesn't necessarily make you more contemporary. Philosopher Eric Schwitzer level conducted a study between 2007 and 2009 there resulted in a maybe not so surprising conclusion. Ethics professors do non generally perform more ethically then they're not at the cyst and non philosopher peers. In fact, many of those peers belief that ethics professors actually performed less ethically than their counterparts. This is consistent with the story of cheating who despite knowing a buttload about ethical theory ended up in the bad place because of the people he unwittingly hurt through his struggle to apply those theories. This is why everyone hates moral philosophy professors. Oh, did we mention the good places? Really the bad place. We'll get to that.

Speaker 1:          06:41          I can't believe you figured it out. [inaudible] also studied the effects of university level ethics classes on student behavior and concluded that there is little to no correlation between taking ethics classes and moral behavior. Again, not a shocker. We often see eleanor struggling to weigh competing theories when deciding how to act. Irl comp says that lying is always wrong and I follow that Max, so you can't even lie to demons. They're trying to torture us, man. We're behind enemy lines that suppose out principles when you pick and choose when you're going to follow them, and she's actually trying, which can't exactly be set. A freshman and a fixed glass. The Schwitzer Bible study even showed that ethics books go missing from the library more often than other kinds of philosophy books. Draw your own conclusions on that one. I might not have been a saint, but it's not like a killed anybody wasn't an arsonist and never found a wallet outside of an, I haven't thought about returning it, but saw the owner lived out of state, so just took the cash and drop the wallet back on the ground.

Speaker 3:          07:37          Okay. That's really specific and that makes me think that you definitely did do that.

Speaker 1:          07:40          Much of the shows, comedy comes from the absurdity of what moral theory looks like. One played out in reality, whether that's the panic of indecision or the hilarity and Gore of the infamous trolley problem happening with a real trolley.

Speaker 4:          07:53          Here are the lovers, the switch, the tracks that the choice. The thing is, I mean ethically speaking, I mean on the one hand you're telling, telling you

Speaker 1:          08:06          see some of the clearest moral improvement when the characters stop weighing choices based on theory and simply follow their gut,

Speaker 3:          08:12          which one of these confusing French books, we'll make it normal again. It's that easy. I mean emotionally, he's all over the map right now and I can't believe I'm saying this, but I don't think this can be solved with a book.

Speaker 1:          08:23          This suggests that while the fact that eleanor is trying to be a better person is certainly helping her make better choices. It's not the theories themselves, the do the work. It's a little more subconscious than that. Eleanor's progress might be explained by a Meta ethical concept called moral intuition, ism moral intuition. Ism aren't used that it's our intuitive awareness of what's right and wrong, not book learning. Then Sam's are ethical knowledge that might seem to be a problem for our main characters since none of them appear to have any moral intuitions whatsoever. Plus here, do you have a ton of preorders? Here is your first cut of the profits. Ho Lima, Mum, I can't believe you sold the tee shirt. Does it help if they basically sold themselves? However, there are branches of moral intuition ism that suggest intuitions can change while memorizing q may nod, zap eleanor into a perfect trim free angel.

Speaker 1:          09:17          It does open up a space for self reflection that was previously pretty close to off on kind of like a self improvement kick. Do you think you could help me out? Teach me to get all horny for the environment or whatever. We could also read the show through the rules of Aristotle's virtue ethics. The idea that the best path to morality is by following the example of virtuous people. The good place does seem to make the case for the power of friendship, but the problem with this theory is that at least in the beginning, there are no truly good people for any of them to copy. So Cheeky Teaching Aristotle is actually pretty ironic. Things get really intriguing when eleanor goes back to Earth, the end of season two from the get go, she acts way more morally than she did in her old life.

Speaker 1:          10:00          Despite having zero memory of the lesson she learned in the bad, good place. This suggests that those experiences, whether with books or with her friends have ultra term moral intuitions, even though she can't remember them. Sure. If she falls off the ethical wagon once or twice, I quit eat my farts benedict cumberbatch, but it doesn't take a lot of prompting from Michael. The barkeep for her to seek out some help. Something about eleanor is undeniably different. Also, I met Michael makes a mean screwdriver because of you know, all the torture and stuff. Although we aren't really going to talk about predestination in this video. The ending of season two pretty much wax you over the head with their answer to can people change? Yes they can. However, this comes after an entire season of eleanor in the gang making similar decisions over and over and over times 802 every time Michael resets their neighborhood.

Speaker 1:          10:50          So although we can make our own destinies changing habits, sure is a bitch or bitch, son of a bench. Although we over here at wise crack think that the good place ultimately rejects the idea that teaching ethics directly leads to more ethical action. It's not totally clear. Gds lessons are no joke and the most profound evidence of that is in Michael, who after just a few weeks of lessons becomes a decent person Ga's or at least an honorary person. If anyone send to fight off predestination. It's that guy. There's just one more thing, one philosophical inspiration in the good place that no matter how tangential it is, your main argument we just have to talk about to show gets a lot of inspiration from a wise crack favorite John Paul Sarte. So in season one the finale reveals that they are all trash humans and the good place is really an experimental neighborhood in the bad place where Tahani Eleanor, Jason, and cheaty are meant to torment each other for all of eternity.

Speaker 1:          11:52          Michael, the demon architect who designed the neighborhood has a theory that four carefully selected people will torture each other far more effectively. Then butthole spiders were trying out the new butthole spiders. They're enormous. Eleanor unknowingly tortures cheaty by forcing him to make difficult choices. His real life nightmare. We are trapped in a warped version of niches, eternal recurrence. Oh cool. More philosophy that'll help us cheaty tortures to honey by refusing to make a decision to pick her over eleanor, a reminder of the second best status she had with her sister before her death. I get tired of objective representation. I trust my audience, my bed. He has a hat. Yes, well done to honey. The honey maybe knowingly tortures eleanor by providing a constant reminder of how much better she is. It's just so sweet, teensy, just like you, your book. To me, that's fine.

Speaker 1:          12:49          And everything tortures Jason because all he wants to do is be himself and he can't even tell people his real name was also, he never got to see the Jacksonville Jaguars when their division title last year. I'm not convinced that a life with no floor to dance crew will ever be scarier than ask Arachnids. But Hey, I'm not a literal hell monster. So what do I know? Another way to read the first season is a modern retelling of philosophers, John Paul Sartre. No exit in it, sorry. Riffs on his famous idiom. Hell is other people with three bags locked in a room in the underworld who make each other miserable through lies, love triangles and everything you could imagine from people who ended up in well hell and in season one, the neighbors of the good place managed to make each other very, very miserable. It's important to clear up a common misconception.

Speaker 1:          13:39          Hell is not other people because someone brought their crying toddler to see deadpool, but because in no exit and in the good place, you're a turtle, neighbors will bring out what you hate most about yourself. The torture is predicated not by say, attending an eternal dinner party with people who use the word mouthfeel, but by letting those people decide how you see yourself leading to the ultimate existential as sin, bad faith, the similarities to no exit don't end with the dope existentialists themes. Some of the characters themselves have a lot in common with their good place counterparts. I nez who describes herself as a damned bitch is pretty much the 1940s eleanor except a lot worse. She turns people against each other for fun, causes misery wherever she goes and thrives on her own. Selfishness. A stele is a high society socialite who's obsessed with her own beauty and wishes desperately for a mirror. She insists that she does not belong in hell and for much of the play refuses to believe that she was a bad person on earth. I belong in the good place, the real one with the good people. Who do I speak to about correcting this? Your role very well. I would like to speak to your manager is still snobbishness about the working class is more than a little familiar.

Speaker 5:          14:52          She's not used to dressing like a plumber. Rats that when you call a female plumber or is it a a toilet suite for or clunk winch. In any case, that's how I'm dressed.

Speaker 1:          15:04          She also murdered a baby, which to honey has probably never done probably

Speaker 5:          15:09          we don't make any sense together and yet when I'm with you, I can really let my hair down, my depart can speaking of course, because I'd never had it up in the first place.

Speaker 1:          15:21          G doesn't have quite the same amount of overlap with his counterpart Garsa, but there are certainly some character traits that ring a bell. Garcia is a coward which gets him killed. And Gidi is terrified of making decisions, which is just its own brand of cowardice.

Speaker 6:          15:36          Oh, I'm sorry everyone. I just have some worries as well as some concerns that could potentially turn into outright fears. Oh, there they go. Ah, there, there a few years now.

Speaker 1:          15:45          Well, so remember how CIDI refuses to Pick Tahani over. Eleanor totally happens and no exit. Sadly there is no Jason God. That play would be so much better with Jason. Whoa. What is happening? She having an orgasm? Did I do somehow? So the good place is initially a show about hell being other people and also a show about the philosophy of philosophies of which were discerning the philosophy of also probably something about Cacti. But the real question to end on is this, did watching this video on the ethics of the good place make you a better person? And if you didn't learn anything from this video, well don't say we didn't try to save your ass. Literally all of these lessons paid off. Whoever said philosophy was stupid many times.
