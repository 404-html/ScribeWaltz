Speaker 1:          00:03          Hey, wise, crack jared here. Okay, so we're going to do something a little risky, a little crazy, and maybe even a little sack religious weren't criticizing Pixel because even though it's brought us the tear jerking joys of inside out wally and the toy story saga, it's genius is not entirely above some sloppy storytelling. Turns out no studio can resist the allure of a cash grab, grabby sequel, and that's kind of what 2016 finding dory felt like to us, it just didn't seem as emotionally resident as pixars best work and being the obsessive nerds that we are here at wise crack. We had to ask ourselves why it's worth mentioning here that according to the Guardian, finding dory underwent massive rewrites where those rewrites to blame for our dissatisfaction with the movie is finding glory, a lesser film than finding Nemo. Is this simply a case of sql lightest or we just overfish stories?

Speaker 1:          00:55          Well, let's lay this thing and find out. Welcome to wise crack addiction on finding dory. What went wrong?

Thanks to lastpass for sponsoring this video and check them out in the link in the description to get started and now on with the show finding dory comes up short and at least four key areas we're finding nemo excels for the sake of clarity, let's categorize these problems as one clouded emotional investment too. Shaky narrative structure, three, passive heroism and for purposeless entourage. To be fair, these issues are almost impossible to separate from one another, so there will inevitably be some overlap, but here we go anyway.

Speaker 1:          02:31          First, the question of emotional investment, a key objective of any screenplay is to get the audience to care deeply about the protagonist, a goal that's often achieved by first getting us to care about whatever our protagonist most values and slash or needs. Maybe the protagonist is focused on scoring and internship or going the distance in the boxing ring or on breaking free of a suffocating life. Whatever the case in most strong screenplays that desire is established early, it's singular, it's powerful, and it generates our empathy in finding nemo and finding dory. The protagonist's goals are blatantly similar in the first film, Marlin searches for his kidnap son in the second door. He searches for the parents. She hazely remembers, although there's nothing wrong with leaning on the trope of the missing family member. I mean it works for Liam Neeson.

Speaker 1:          03:20          Finding Nemo and finding dory unfortunately have different attitudes toward the magnitude of loss. That's because only one of these films offers us a baseline before it rips a loved one away and it's that baseline that creates emotional connection between us, the protagonist and the protagonists need. In other words, even though the bulk of finding Nemo keeps Marlin and Nemo apart, it first offers a sense of what these family members mean to one another as early as the first minute of finding Nemo Porch. Hold what? Marlin values more than anything else in the world. These are our kids. We're talking about thinking they're the best, and Marlin proves that value system through his actions in the films baseline moments. We see Marlin pledged to protect his son, then tease his son, then prepare his son for school, then bring his son to school and then lecture his son.

Speaker 1:          04:07          You're about to swim in open water. We have a sense of history, so when Mimo gets kidnapped 15 minutes into the film, we like Marlin, have loved and we have lost. We are infested. Finding Dory offers no such baseline so it never offers the Gut Punch delivered by its predecessor. In fact, dory loses her parents within the first five minutes of finding dory in the opening scene of the film, Dory, even to her own parents is positioned as something of a liability. A cute little goof. Okay, sweetheart. What about that rhyme? We learn, we see the undertow and we say no, no, surely thereafter, like bubbles in the bath tub. Her parents vanish. How much can we really be expected to pour our emotions into losing characters we never knew? Where are your parents?

Speaker 1:          04:57          If finding dory can't get much mileage out of the parent child bond, that energized, finding Nemo. Then what is the central relationship here? Where do we invest our empathy? You might guess that we feed into the bond between Marlin and Dory. After all, they did spend a whole movie together. They're probably totally buds now, right? Or what you can do. You can go wait over there, go right over there and forgot to do best. Not really. Seems the arc of personal growth that Marlin and Dory experienced in finding nemo has reverted here with Dory now being viewed as a nuisance by pretty much everyone. Sadly, it isn't until dory is separated from the relationships she formed in the first film that were introduced to what is supposed to be her source of support in this movie, the bond between Dory and Hank, a curmudgeonly octopus who wants only to exploit dory for the transport tag attached to her fit.

Speaker 1:          05:51          No, no, no. If I just take your bag, I can take your place on the transport truck and yeah, I mean that's pretty much it. That's the nature of their friendship. Heartwarming, right? The emotionally deficient relationship between hank and dory is almost entirely transactional and deceitful, which doubles down on the films empathy gap. But later finding dory hastily tries to switch gears and that brings us to our second point, shaky narrative structure. Take a look at most memorable films and you'll find the protagonist making a key decision right at the center of the story. It's a moment that reframes the protagonists, objectives and tests his or her resolve some. Refer to this as the film's midpoint shift. It's no coincidence that the halfway mark is often a major moment of self reflection for the protagonists, a turning point in his or her journey. So what happens halfway through finding dory?

Speaker 1:          06:43          Well, hank reveals he's got a soft spot for that loopy bluefish. He'll forgive me in a heartbeat. Kid 300 new. But where did this sentiment come from? It's surely not earned by any particular actions or moments in the film itself because hanging dory are never really a team. And unlike Dorian Marlin, they're never really shown enjoying their adventure. And Hey, come to think of it, hank isn't even the protagonist here. In any case, since Dorian, hank have almost no moments of genuine connection within the first half of finding dory hanks. Change of heart towards Dory, midway through the film. Can't help but feel unearned. I don't care. Contrast this with the realization Marlin experiences in the middle of finding nema and maybe wouldn't have done it if I hadn't been so tough on him here. Marlin begins to recognize the error of his overprotective parenting style, and this realization is a direct result of his control freak behavior, nearly getting dory killed throughout finding Nemo.

Speaker 1:          07:42          This midpoint shifts and other character revealing moments are directly motivated by cause and effect. Mimo is motivated to put his life in jeopardy because he learns his dad is heroic. Ua Dad's been fighting the entire ocean. Looking for you. Marlin is motivated to team with Dory because he realizes dory can read. You can read, I can read later. Marlin is motivated to separate himself from Dory because he thinks his son is dead in finding dory. However, key moments in the story like hanks change of heart towards dory are largely motivated by convenience and necessity. There are simply what needs to happen to move characters from point a to point b later. Dory refers the hank as sweet, even though evidence of any such sweetness is scarce at best, but hey, in this movie being an acid pretty easily forgiven as long as you pay lip service to some sort of growth deep into finding dory. Marlin tells story for, since I've met you, you show me how to do stuff I never dreamed of doing crazy thing, but even this sentiment to seems unearned because it leverages moments from the first fill in which Dorian Marlin adventured and grew closer together rather than from this sequel in which they are either separated from each other or annoyed. Nevertheless, this moment is meant to play as a moment of self awareness and maturity from Marlin, which raises the question, what is doerries key moment of self awareness in finding dory?

Speaker 2:          09:11          You are remembered in your own amazing dory way.

Speaker 1:          09:16          Wow. You've got to wait until the movie is nearly over to find out, and this illustrates, finding doerries. Third Setback, passive heroism for much of the film's running time. Dori operates as a passive protagonists, one who responds to events rather than create opportunities. Some have this tendency is due to we're all too convenient memory flashes which handily take the story wherever the screenwriters needed to go. These flashes and even the occasional undertow are driven more by chance and proximity then as a result of personal effort or growth. Although sometimes it's almost as if the film is suggesting doerries disability can be willed away. I remembered something. This perspective seems fishy at best and it doesn't leave Dory with many opportunities to demonstrate her ingenuity and develop it. Events often happened to dory rather than because of her, and that's never a recipe for great storytelling. Of course, a another cause of Doris passivity is the nature of the films actual environment.

Speaker 1:          10:16          After the films, first 20 minutes, dory quite literally becomes a fish out of water, a status which restricts her movements to the whims of other characters. How much can we expect our protagonists to be the master of her own fate, which is being carried around in coffee pots, baby buggies, or a bucket that's labeled destiny. By trading the thrilling blue ocean of the first film to the claustrophobic human centric clinical spaces of finding dory. Pixar ultimately hamstrings the scope of the story it's able to tell and the degree to which as protagonists can help tell it. Dory then isn't a driver of her own story. She's a passenger, a passive responder to triggered memories and odd partnership and very often blind luck, but at least her personal motivation remains relatively clear.

Speaker 2:          11:03          Do you know anyone who lost a kid a long time ago? That wouldn't be me.

Speaker 1:          11:07          She wants to find her parents, and so if we're willing to buy into the premise of the film, we must simply want to find them too. Even though doerries desire to see her family is very conveniently triggered by the school of fish saying the word

Speaker 2:          11:21          right. That's

Speaker 1:          11:22          right. It's true that doerries ultimate objective is never in doubt, but the same can't always be said for Marlin in this film and it's even less clear for Nimo who at this point seems in desperate need of child protective services and this leads us to the purposeless entourage. Oh, pause here to ask a simple but important question. Why does finding dory involve all three of these fish and does nemos involvement actually negatively impact our feelings about Dorian Marlin? That's Marlin having just a year earlier across the perilous ocean to save his only surviving child now agrees to drag that same child with him to guide dory all the way across the ocean. Again, simply because how can you be talking about the view? And I remembered my. No, I'm okay, but this springs from the studios need for a sequel, not from clear character behavior. Ultimately, finding dory commits the sin of asking Marlin and Emo to undermine so much of what made finding nemo powerful.

Speaker 1:          12:23          After all the emotional investment we as an audience made in Nemos recovery and finding Nemo. Finding Dory asks us to believe that Marlin responsible father extraordinary is willing to risk his own son's life. On the basis of Doris Hunch about her parents she hasn't seen in years and no, I'm not being hyperbolic. Mimo really seriously almost dies. I mean, couldn't Marlin just find a babysitter? Why is Nimo part of this new adventure? Why does Dory, who presumably cares about Nimo safety, agreed to pull them along on a dangerous mission to serve her own personal agenda? The film mostly bypasses these questions and if we are to enjoy it, so most wheat, but we should all take a moment here to at least recognize the weirdness of ending a fish movie with a car chase on the freeway and hey, look at that door is a passenger again in her own movie.
