Speaker 1:          00:06          Norm minetta and I'm vice chairman of the hill and Knowlton

Speaker 1:          00:18          infrastructure is so important is it's directly linked to productivity increases. And there's been a tremendous amount of productivity increase since the end of World War II. And that increased, stopped, maybe not stop, but it slowed down about maybe 10, 12 years ago. The there was still increasing, but the rate of the increase of flattened out. But in the last, I think five years or so, 85 to eight years, productivity has gone down because of congestion in urban areas. And so my feeling is that here we are competing in a global economic place and we cannot allow, and we can't afford to have our productivity going down at a time when we're competing in the economic a world marketplace. And so that's why we need this kind of infusion of money into infrastructure.

Speaker 1:          01:31          Well, the logical source in the past has been, uh, the gasoline tax or the fuel tax for a diesel fuel or excise tax on batteries and tires, etc. Now with the fuel efficiency of automobiles going up, uh, the 18.4 cents, federal gasoline tax just produces less money into the highway trust fund. So it's either going to be increased gasoline taxes, which for which there's a resistance or, uh, some other form of fuel tax, maybe based on the odometer reading, uh, and uh, but there's still going to be a gap from what that generates and what the needs are. And my feeling is that public private partnerships, how to be used to fill that gap.

Speaker 1:          02:43          I think when you think about, uh, infrastructure, uh, it probably would a surround a what I would think of maybe as employment. What does it do in terms, especially right now, uh, given the unemployment rate, what is it do in terms of employment? What does it do in terms of the environment and what does it do in terms of the economy as a whole? And, um, and I think from there you can take subsets of each of those broad areas and come up with criteria that would be applicable to any project that might be funded so that you're looking for efficiency and effectiveness of that funding. So then at the end of the day, it's not just this question of, Oh, that's nice you spent $200 million on that project, but what did we get for that $200 million?

Speaker 2:          03:55          Seems to me that

Speaker 1:          03:57          there's been a lot of talk about a return to more bipartisanship, that the American people are tired of the kind of constant bickering going on back and forth between the Congress and the executive branch, and that, uh, there ought to be more, um, civility, I guess, in the relationship, uh, between the administration and the Congress panned, uh, within the congress as well.

Speaker 2:          04:32          Yeah.
