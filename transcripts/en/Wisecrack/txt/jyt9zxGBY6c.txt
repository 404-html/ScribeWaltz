Speaker 1:          00:03          Hey everyone, jared, I possibly rl here and today we're questioning the nature of our reality season two of westworld premiere this week and it got some pretty mixed reactions, but hopefully it's just setting the stage for great stuff to come. Today I want to talk about the biggest question the premiere raises. Is there any difference between humans and flesh box? And the biggest clue I'm going to argue is right here in the intro. Welcome this wisecrack quick take on season two, episode one of Westworld and spoilage. First a quick recap. In the aftermath of Ford's ranger over retirement party, Bernard Poles and inception and wakes up disoriented on a beach. Bernard joins. Dalio is head of operations Karl Strand as they hunt down the rest of the malfunctioning hosts. But in the meantime, we see flashbacks of Bernard weeks earlier trying to survive the parties. Immediate aftermath. Hail Brings Bernard two or secret lab where they Zuckerberg everything by secretly harvesting the guest personal information and DNA stubs stranded. Bernard find that all the hosts are floating in a body of water that shouldn't exist and Bernard reveals that he killed them. Count. Meanwhile, Mavis still trying to find her daughter and as enlisted the help of this use of the city. Yet delores and teddy are on a straight up murder spree and Dolores has a new hobby recycling lines from season one in rapid succession.

Speaker 2:          01:24          He's five ft lights just like anything to me

Speaker 1:          01:29          later. She suggests they take the fun to the humans on the mainland and William is having a grand old time trying not to die before we're getting introduced to the mazes. Much anticipated sequel, the door

Speaker 3:          01:41          have to make it back out the door.

Speaker 1:          01:46          What does it mean? Well, we're going to have to keep watching to find out now. There seems to be too important phrases that we should keep in mind as the season progresses. The first is free and the second is what is real,

Speaker 3:          01:59          which is irreplaceable.

Speaker 1:          02:04          Let's start with the first, since season one, westworld has teased the idea that we're not all that different from the host

Speaker 3:          02:10          humans fancy that there's something special about the way we perceive the world and yet we live in newbs as tight and as close to as the host. Seldom questioning choices contend for the most part to be told what to do next.

Speaker 1:          02:27          Hosts are guided by their programming. That's pretty obvious, but this episode goes to great lengths to invert our understanding of the nature of that program. Previously, we learned that the host had specific drives. What are your,

Speaker 4:          02:41          I tend to my herd, look after my wife

Speaker 1:          02:47          and now dolores is asking the park's guess what their drives are. What are your drives please? I don't want to die. The basic survival instinct is likened to the cornerstone

Speaker 2:          02:59          survival. Sure. Cornerstone

Speaker 1:          03:03          or the foundational memories that define hosts like mave or Bernard backstories do more than amuse guests. They anchor the host. It's their cornerstone just as the hosts, our program with certain instincts, so too are the humans evolutionarily program to pursue survival above all else. This idea that humans are primarily guided by their survival instinct is really driven home by this juxtaposition. Charlotte Hale tells Bernard hosts only do what they're programmed to do. They do with their program, and immediately a delose board member runs for what he thinks will save his life. Some lab techs with the vehicle. Of course it was a trap. The host took advantage of the guest basic survival instincts or to put another way they're programming. Okay, so humans don't like to die. That's not exactly, I'm just a machine one on one, but it's with mave that things get really interesting.

Speaker 1:          03:54          Maybe it's one of the few hosts who has actually seen her programming. Not only that, she knows someone manipulated her code, so she would escape the park and recruit her fellow hosts, but she nonetheless tries to navigate what free will means when it seems all of her choices are predestined at the end of season one. There's a kind of paradox in that she must choose between two things she was programmed to do while on the train. She can escape the park as this mysterious code change wants or to or go back to her fake daughter if it was ambiguous before mave stance on what is real is made abundantly clear when sizemore tells her that her daughter isn't really hers, it's just a story. Somebody we programmed, she's not real. But instead of rejecting this fiction, she says, all right,

Speaker 2:          04:45          what about me? My dreams, my thoughts, my body? And they don't know. What if I took these fingers? Don't use them to decorate the walls with your outsize personality. Would that

Speaker 1:          05:07          be real? Rather than getting tripped up about what is really real may for search her own reality. So what does it mean to embrace something, even though it's a fiction? Westworld here asserts a radical skepticism toward what is really real, especially as far as humanity is concerned. The fact that Mavis searching for her daughter is no accident. The show is overtly using maternal instincts to argue that humans are no less dictated by code then hosts. It's why they threw a baby with its mother into the new intro for humans. Maternal care is strongly associated with a kind of biological coding. You and mother's care for their young and let them live a parasitic existence for the next 1825 years of their life because their genes tell them to. And while we see similar behavior in chimps, the same can't be said for other animals who exhibit different biologically coded ways to relate to their young bears abandoned.

Speaker 1:          05:57          They're young. If they're too weak, harp seals ditch them after 12 days to find another mate cuckoos trick other animals into doing their dirty work and some spiders just go ahead and let their babies eat them alive. It's called [inaudible] and it's so in math, but the point is can we really call naves relationship to her daughter fake when we as humans are reared by an adult woman because her genes tell her to coddle us instead of dumbass onto the neighbor's lawn and that's the real meaning of the boy Ford's words. Everything in here is code William, the host and it's human guests are bounded by their programming, whether it be genetic or artificial into further muddy the waters of this real versus fake distinction. Let's turn back to burn Arnold's words that what is real is what is irreplaceable. If that's true, then Arnold's not real because he was replaced by Bernard and there's a whole room full of Bernard's we've seen in this trailer. And if Arnold can get replaced by a host, can we all, there's one more phrase, all motors

Speaker 2:          06:56          function.

Speaker 1:          07:00          Now there's one more thing on my mind. When Bernard taps into the Mesh Network, he troubleshoots his own malfunction and we get a list of everything wrong with him. Lapse in time. And this big word prosopagnosia turns out this means face blindness and could potentially explain why the hell burn artists fixated on this corpse.
