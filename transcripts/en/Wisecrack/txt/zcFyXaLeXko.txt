Speaker 1:          00:20          Greetings and welcome to earthlink cinema. I'm your host Garrick's wormy Lloyd. This week's artifact is spirited away, the award winning masterpiece from legendary animator and confirmed Silver Fox. How yells a media Xochi. The story opens on a 10 year old human female named Shahir row and her parental units as they get lost in the woods, and if a human is lost in the woods and no one is around to hear it, does it register as a sentient life? Form point is these schmoes accidentally stumbled their way into a magical land filled with delicious food. That's by none. Get a million free. The parents start stuffing it down there, gullets and lose their kosher status faster than you can say, Oh, oh God. To hero does what any child would do in this situation and abandons her porky parents to go beef up her resume.

Speaker 2:          01:11          Could you give me a job please, please. I just want to,

Speaker 1:          01:16          after much haranguing a wrinkly, old cronut named you Baba hires to hero to work in her bath house, but changes her name to send as a show of bad faith and so made this dreamboat Haku warned said not to forget her real name like he did, or else it can cause a real headache at the DMV. You name a stink spirit arrives at the bath house around mid same time. It usually arrives for me. Send cleans them successfully and to thank her, the Spirit bestows upon her the greatest gift of all, a little Turd and fused with IPECAC elsewhere. A guy named no face pays for a bunch of food with gold, which is the very foundation of a transactional ecosystem, so it doesn't really seem like much of a problem. Why is everyone screaming soon? Who gets poisoned and Oh, by the way, he's also a dragon now sometimes saying gives them part of that Turd to crunch on, which makes him bark off a shiny little egg mcmuffin while she's at it.

Speaker 1:          02:13          She gives the rest of the term to know face just to see how much barfing is allowed in a pg movie. Turns out it's a metric ass load. Next, send visit Zinni. You, Barbara, his twin sister, to give back the mcguffin. Haikus stole during the breakfast rush, an informed sen that it was her love for her coup that broke some cursor, another which is gross because sin is 10 and Huck, who's gotta be at least 18 backoff creep. There are plenty of other fish in the sea monster. Later, completely unprompted. Send remembers a time she fell into the [inaudible] River, which they arbitrarily decide means that huck who is short for Co Haku and he's a river spirit, so he's like a thousand and their relationship is even more inappropriate. Shame on you. Japan. You Baba gives sen last pop quiz where she has to identify your parents, but sen wasn't born yesterday.

Speaker 1:          03:04          I mean technically, yes, sin was born yesterday, but Shahir wasn't none of these gigs or my mom or dad and now that she's a hero, again, it's time to grab her rehumanized parents and blow this popsicle store. Spirited away is a coming of age story and the tradition of classics like Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland and James Franco's the wizard of Oz, which similarly portray a young girl transported to a strange place where she asked to do a bunch of stuff at the start of the film to hero is naive and inexperienced with a dash of timid and whiny, sprinkled in for good measure. Look to euro. There's your new school. It is only by solving problems and helping those in need that you hero gains the self reliance and empathy needed to terrorize a giant baby. Underneath this story of renewal and vomiting lurks a cautionary tale of greed and overconsumption, particularly as it relates to post war Japan after the shall we say messy end of World War Two, Japan experienced an economic boom, no offense, non taken that correlated with a cultural shift toward capitalism and away from traditional values.

Speaker 1:          04:16          The spirit realm takes the form of an old amusement park styled after the Meiji period of the late 19th and early 20th century, which are two of my all time favorite centuries discarded trines. Adorn the hillside symbolizing the relegation of cultural history in favor of more modern pursuits like leisure and interdimensional slipstreams. In this economically driven environment, overconsumption has dire consequences, much like the type you might find in a prenup to heroes, parents snarfed down food from the spirit realm, despite its obviously suspicious lack of vegetables. Don't worry, you've got Daddy, he's got credit cards and cash. In return. They are transformed into pigs which are commonly used on earth as a critical symbol of capitalists, cultures that would bring about the eradication of humankind. That's all folks. The bathhouse furnace has also shaped like a pig constantly gobbling resources just to give guests a slightly more temperate bubble bath.

Speaker 1:          05:15          When no face shows up overflowing with gold, you Baba and our workers milk that proverbial horse for every last fluid ounce, but as the staff showers, no face and access, he can't help but shower them in stomach acid. The film expresses hope that modern Japan can find a balance between economic prosperity and spiritual heritage. There as much emphasis on remembering one's name. If you completely forget it, you'll never find your way home and the identity of one's parents look hard. It's up to you to remember which ones they are, and even though I forget both of those things on a daily basis, mom, they are important in forging a connection to one's ancestry. The message deepens when we consider the context of the film prior to making spirited away. Director Hio Miyazaki was considering passing the torch to the next wave of artists at studio Ghibli, though he reconsidered when he remembered he was the man. Furthermore, at the time when many animated films were visualized using computers, spirited away was drawn using an elaborate system of levers and pulleys and it story conveys the hope that future generations will flourish and progress while at the same time respecting the history of the art form, whatever that was.
