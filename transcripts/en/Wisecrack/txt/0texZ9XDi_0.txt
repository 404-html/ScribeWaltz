Speaker 1:          00:05          Benign Causes Depression and anxiety. I learned about a bit less connections. There were few that were really challenging for me because I realized how much I recognize them in myself. So one of the hardest, I'll tell you a story about something else first, but when I was in 2009 on Christmas Eve, it makes it even sadder. The story happened on Christmas Eve, so I used to live on junk food. I used to eat appallingly and on Christmas Eve, 2009, I went into my local KFC at lunchtime and I turned up and I gave my order, which is so disgusting. I can't even repeat it. And the guy behind the counter said, are Johann so glad you're here. Wait a minute. It was like, okay, so you walked off and he came back with all the other staff and they bought me a massive Christmas card and they'd written it to our best customer and so I was looking at this and my heart sank.

Speaker 1:          00:54          I thought, this isn't even the fried chicken shop. I come to the most. It was very unfortunate that low point, but we all know, right? Junk food has taken over our diet. It's not admittedly to the extreme the eyebrows, but junk food is increasingly dominating our diets and it's making us physically sick. One thing that really shocked me in the research is that there's. There's really good evidence. There's something similar has happened with our minds, but I kind of junk values have taken over our minds and they've made us mentally sick, but the thousands of years now, philosophers have said, if you think life is about money and status and and showing off, you're going to feel terrible right? From Confucius on down people that rewarding is that, but weirdly nobody had actually scientifically investigated it until an incredible man. I got to know your professor, Tim Kasser, who's at Knox University in Illinois, so professor cass a new.

Speaker 1:          01:47          When it comes to human motivation, this basically, to put it crudely, two kinds of human motivation, right? Imagine you play the piano. If you play the piano in the morning because you love it and it gives you joy, that's an intrinsic motivation. You're not doing it to get something out a bit. You're just doing it because that thing gives you joy right now. Imagine you play the piano not because it gives you joy, but in a dive bar to pay the rent or because your parents are really pressuring you to be a piano maestro or I'd know to impress a man might be some weird piano fetishist, right? That would be an extrinsic reasons to play the piano. You're not doing it for the experience itself. You're doing it to get something out. You're doing it at one remove. You're doing it to get something out of the experience.

Speaker 1:          02:31          Now we're all a mixture of intrinsic and extrinsic values obviously, and we change throughout our lives, but professor cass discovered some really fascinating things. The first thing is the more your life is dominated by extrinsic values, the more you're doing things, not because you think they're important, but because of how you'll look to other people, how you're seem on the outside, the more likely you are to become depressed and anxious. It's a quite significant effect. Has Been found in 22 studies with depression and 14 studies with anxiety. Now, there are many reasons. I'll give you just one. One of the things we know is that something that's a real source of joy in human life since really necessary have what are called flow states right there. Moments when you're doing something you really love. For me, it's writing for someone else. It might be running.

Speaker 1:          03:14          It's definitely not that for me or you know, whatever. Uh, when you time seems to collapse, you're totally in the moment of what you're doing and you're just, you're flowing right? Extreme extrinsic values massively disrupt your ability to get into flow states. Imagine you're playing the piano. Imagine the guys playing the piano for intrinsic reasons, right? Because it gives them joy. Now imagine suddenly has to think, am I the best piano player in New York City today? Who's better than me? How are these people listening to me? How are they judging me? Am I going to get paid for this? You can see how it would jolt you out of the flow state, right? When you think extrinsically, you get jolted out of flow state, there are many reasons why extrinsic values make us feel bad and they ruin the quality of your relationships. They crowd out intrinsic values.

Speaker 1:          03:57          There's all sorts of things going on, but press castles also showing that extrinsic values have been taking over our culture. We are becoming more and more dominated by these extrinsic values. This we are immersed in this way of thinking for the moment we're born more 18 month old children recognize the Mcdonald's m, the know that own surname. We are pickled in advertising messages telling us that life is about living extrinsically, right? Imagine an advert that told you, you know what? You're great. You look fine. You smell nice, you're amazing. You don't need anything more today. That would be the worst advert that ever been done. Right? Advertising is the ultimate frenemy is always telling you, oh babe, I love you. It's just, you know, didn't stink right now what professor Castillo's showed as he puts it is at some level we all know this, right?

Speaker 1:          04:43          Everyone watching this knows you're not going to lie on the on the last day of your life. You will not lie there and think about all the things you bought, right? You will not think about all the hours you put in at the office. You will think about moments of deep meaning and connection, but as professor Cassar puts it, we live in a machine that is constantly diverting us from what is meaningful about life. There's a wonderful experiment is done before Professor Castle's work, but I think it really illustrates this and it was done. Nineteen 78. It's really simple experiment. You get a lot of five year olds and you put them in a sandpit and you split them into two groups. The first group is shown to advertisements for specific toy. Whatever the 19, 78 equivalent of peppa pig was, right, and the second group is shown show no adverts and at the end of it they give all the kids a choice.

Speaker 1:          05:29          They said, okay, kids go choice. Now you can either play with a nice boy who doesn't have the toy from the out of it or you can play with a nasty boy who's got the toy. The kids who didn't see the ad mostly choose the nice boy without the toy and the kids who saw the ad, mostly twos, the nasty boy who's got the toy, so just to advertisements to prime those children to choose and inanimate lump of plastic over kindness and connection. We are all being driven by way more advertising than that everyday, right? Anyone watching this and I would include myself in that, he stayed late at work, do something they don't want to do to buy something they don't need rather than go be home with their kids. Maybe you've fallen prey to that dynamic and professor Kessler has really shown this way that we've got to. We've got to unpick these junk values, these junk values, what we've been fed for so long. There are kind of KFC for the soul and they're making us feel terrible.
