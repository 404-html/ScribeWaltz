Speaker 1:          00:01          This video is brought to you by blackwoods. Stick around till the end of the video for a preview.

Speaker 1:          00:09          What's up guys? Jared here, as I briefly alluded to in our last south park video, I've been playing a lot of red dead redemption two lately and at the risk of sounding hyperbolic, it's nothing less than a milestone in the art of gaming. Now, I could spend the entirety of this video geeking out about the detail, the story of the performances, but that's not what I want to talk about today because surprise, I want to talk about philosophy. In fact, there's one mission in the game that builds its entire trajectory around too philosophical ideas and not only is it quite clever, but it builds off the critique of early American values that the franchise is so famous for versus America. You can always cut a deal. So welcome to this test Vlog format on red dead redemption. Two we might do a bigger wisecrack condition that focuses on the entirety of the game, but I haven't even finished it yet.

Speaker 1:          01:01          In the meantime, I know you guys like hearing about our process, so consider this a little window into how we think about things. Let us know what you think about it. This new format in the comments and very insignificant spoilers ahead. Seriously, it just doesn't matter. Starting early in chapter four, you can go on a three part stranger mission called idealism and pragmatism for beginners. So yeah, you can probably see why we're breaking down this mission. It comically explores the basic tenants of idealism and pragmatism, but it's in its exploration of pragmatism, a uniquely American philosophy that we get to see that classic rock star sarcasm as they take American values down a peg. And the first part of the mission we're introduced to mayor Lemieux, the pragmatist and his assistant John mark the idealist. The Mayor Informs Arthur that he recently bought a collection of classic paintings to hang in a new museum. He plans to open, but turns out he's been conned. The sleazy art dealer painted them himself, but that's no biggie for Limu. The problem solver who will display them anyway, these are good paintings. I can't make the difference. And I'm French, but an expert by the name of professor shift occur is on his way to evaluate the paintings and make public their fraudulence. So Mayor Lemieux Hires Arthur to intimidate professor shift occur so that he changes his professional opinion and deems the paintings real shift occur initially. Resist. Bud Arthur's fist are quite convincing.

Speaker 1:          02:28          Okay. So what does this have to do with either philosophy? Well, in this part of the mission, we most clearly see an interesting exploration of pragmatism originating in the 1870s pregnant tism isn't American philosophy primarily developed by Charles Pierce? William James and John Dewey pragmatists vary in their specific philosophies, but one tendency among them all is their willingness to settle metaphysical and scientific debates according to the practical consequences of ideas. So basically they emphasize that which useful to advance human understanding of the world. More importantly, this stands in contrast with those who sought out universal truths with reason allowed German idealists like a manual con. So on the one level we see the mayor ever the pragmatist deciding to beat the shit out of a man. So long as it's useful. And John Mark the idealist holding moral principles as universal truths, not unlike our boy caught fire nuts is never right.

Speaker 1:          03:25          But there's another reading of this scenario that perhaps incidentally comments on how pragmatism deals with our understanding of reality. Pragmatists don't look towards universal truths and stress that human ideas about reality are likely wrong. So because humans are fallible, some pragmatic thinkers favor ideas that are the most useful for a pragmatist like John Dewey. Scientific hypotheses are great because they're useful. And even if they're not 100% right, we can fumble around with them to acquire more scientific knowledge, which allows us to concoct better theories. The same for dewey should be true of philosophical ideas. Rather than search for some capital t truth, one should instead search for an idea that may be useful to humanity and its advancement of knowledge. So here we see another layer to the joke. The mayor hires Arthur to beat the shit out of a guy until he admits that a fake painting is real. Now, although this isn't exactly what the pragmatist we're talking about, they're making a blunt if reductive joke about pragmatism. Sure. The paintings aren't real per se, but the idea that they are real has its use in the advancement of public education and culture. So who cares if they're fraudulent

Speaker 2:          04:37          vapor? Going to look at those pains and love them. So you're helping me

Speaker 1:          04:41          as William James said in his work, pragmatism, a new name for some old ways of thinking. The true is the name for whatever proves itself to be good in the way of belief and good too for definite assignable reasons. This idea of partial truths also comes up later.

Speaker 2:          04:57          I'm worried that he's going to open his mouth and say things that aren't true to those vulgar puritans at the newspaper. Well perhaps true, but not the whole truth.

Speaker 1:          05:07          Now I don't think anyone at rock star is reading John Dewey and if you are, please send me an email. But this take on pragmatism as it's more commonly understood by non philosophers is in line with red dead cynical take on the value systems that propelled the west at the turn of the century. Pragmatism is darkly cast as an ideology that more or less justifies selfish, cynical behavior.

Speaker 2:          05:29          Education is the most wonderful thing. It'll raise us higher and higher. Make civics and ethics lesser work of a dirty minded pragmatists like me and the calling of higher, better men here, hey,

Speaker 1:          05:47          in part two of the mission, we see this distinction between the dirty pragmatism of the mayor and John Marks. Idealism. When the mayor hires you to once again intimidate a man into funding the library, Arthur does what he does best and the newspaper man gives in and libraries are good things, right? Look at these beautiful books. This is magnificent. We'll bring this city back to life. If it kills me, I didn't probably shower, so if it requires a little bit of nasty business to get something done, it's worth it, right? Such pragmatic justifications for pretty gnarly shit are all over both games, including the essential conflict of the first game, threatened John's family in order to get him to do what they want, killed the remaining members of the gang. In the third and final part of the mission, we see a final standoff between these two ideas systems.

Speaker 1:          06:39          When John Mark Turns on the mayor for his seeming lack of principals will strive to improve the city's moral backbone by any means available to us who we are then reasoning. Yes. Yes, yes. Within my reason because it's better to get something done than nothing at all. Like you said, Tony, uh, Tony corrupted lemieux how I long for the luxury to have principles such as you, but I must actually do things. So there you have it. A little taste of philosophy in what is undoubtedly a top contender for game of the year. So what do you guys think? Is this exploration of pragmatism relevant in more areas than just this one mission? What does know what you think and hope you guys enjoyed this new blog format. And as I already mentioned, I'm super impressed with the story of red dead too.
