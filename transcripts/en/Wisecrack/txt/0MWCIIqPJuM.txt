Speaker 1:          00:11          Worldview? Well, I, I, I'm a great believer in him and liberty. I think, uh, the, the genius of the American experiment is a respect for the dignity of the individual. And, um, that's why I'm opposed to a trade restrictions. Uh, I'm opposed to most immigration restrictions. I think human beings are human beings and, uh, and that they had deserve the dignity of, of freedom. And that's a worldwide phenomenon. I must say that in the 30 years the Cato Institute is existed, and I'm not saying we deserve credit for it, but, uh, the extension of human freedom has been remarkable. I mean, hundreds of millions of people are freer today, more prosperous today, uh, because of the recognition that markets work, uh, the expansion of trade, the, um, uh, recognition of the importance of private property. Um, those are great things. And I, I, I view them as universal. I mean, the Cato Institute is actively involved in promoting these ideas in, uh, in the Middle East, in Russia and Latin America, uh, China.

Speaker 1:          01:35          Um, so we held the first conferences devoted to freedom in the history of communist China. And in the history of the Soviet Union. Uh, we went to China in 1988 and, uh, we brought, uh, Milton Friedman there. And Milton was treated like a rockstar. Uh, it was very exciting. And then, uh, two years later we were in Moscow and, uh, and had the first conference they're devoted to, to political and economic freedom. And, uh, so I'm very proud of the cato institutes orientation. It's not simply parochial. I mean we are around the world trying to promote the concept of the dignity of the individual.

Speaker 1:          02:24          Well, um, you know, the, the basic kind of classical Roth Bharti and approach to libertarianism is, is, uh, uh, that, uh, you can't have, and this is a randy and I Iran's approach to the initiation of force. It's wrong that people should be able to do whatever they want to do as long as they're not harming other people in doing so, whether through fraud or physical violence or a theft or, uh, whatever, uh, so that you want the maximum amount of individual liberty. But you know, it's interesting. Um, it's not all clear cut in theory from a purely rights standpoint. What Michael Vick did with these dogs was, didn't, uh, didn't, uh, offend anyone's personal rights. But I think as a libertarian, and maybe I'm, I'm, uh, I'm getting in trouble with my colleagues, but I th I think that, uh, uh, uh, in a free society that you should be able to say, you know, you can't torture animals and that's going to be a crime and it doesn't fit in neatly with a libertarian theory of rights.

Speaker 1:          03:42          But I think it's, that's the way it should be. Of course, I love dogs so, well, I think the proper role of the, the government is the protection of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness, which is what the declaration of Independence said. I mean, that's a very, very, uh, radical concept that government should be limited, uh, to protecting your right to live your life as, as you, uh, choose. Um, I also think, you know, the phrase, the pursuit of happiness is uniquely American. I mean, it is saying that life is a good thing and that you should be able to enjoy it. And happiness is not saying you should go to a party every night. It's saying you should be able to pursue your values and your goals in life. And, uh, I think that's a reasonable goal for government. Uh, I, I, you know, obviously, uh, uh, clean air and water, you shouldn't be able to pollute what the, the average citizen has to deal with. Uh, those are legitimate functions of government.
