Speaker 1:          00:09          Hey wisecrack jared here today we're talking about an Amazon and she has nothing to do with an endangered plant species or free two day shipping. Wonder woman wasn't just the mega box office hit of the summer. The film and its eponymous hero have become one of 2017 biggest cultural icons and surprise. We have something to say about it. Now some have called areas a pretty lack luster villain, but his conflict with Diana is pretty interesting compared to most superhero villains who want to just rule the world or ruled world or rule as guard or rule the universe and part of what makes this Greek God family drama so cool is that aries doesn't just blindly hate Diana. There clash over the nature and fate of humanity is well pretty philosophical, so get ready to be lassoed by the truth in this wise crack addition on the philosophy of wonder woman and cue the sirens.

Speaker 1:          00:58          One of the central conflicts of wonder woman is do humans deserve to be saved? This makes sense. Since the titular characters from an island of warrior women who exist solely to save humans from destruction at the hand of aries, the God of war. But as it turns out, when you've lived in a tropical paradise with no boys allowed for a couple of millennia, you might decide that humans aren't really worth the effort. View's great demand to be Justin Wise, strong and passionate. That was a story. Diane, much of Diana's struggle is wrapped up in the question of what it means to save people. She waivers between a sense of duty, a sense of caring and a moment of great a apathy they done deserve our help. It's not about meanwhile Erin is fully committed to the belief that humans suck a fat bag of popsicles and deserve not only abandonment but also to die painfully via chemical weapons. Area's developed a weapon. The worst ever device. Diana's big hero statement of the film is in response to areas his claim that she responds,

Speaker 2:          01:59          it's not about deserve, it's not what you believe.

Speaker 1:          02:07          We believe that line is confusing is, but instead of dismissing it as bad writing and good old wise cracking and fashion, let's pull it apart. Now before we get the Diana, we have to understand what she's responding to. Areas is belief that humans are worthless and can't have nice things. Aries is claiming the film has two parts, one that humans deserve to be punished and to that they don't deserve Diana's help.

Speaker 3:          02:34          Right?

Speaker 1:          02:38          The first one is a question of something called retribute of justice. Basically the theory that argues that people who do bad things should go to jail. So what informs areas as retribute of mission to destroy humanity? He believes that humans are by nature evil

Speaker 3:          02:54          and always will be weak, cruel, selfish, and capable of the greatest harvest.

Speaker 1:          03:03          This is an essential list view of human nature that humanity has inherit properties that make them what they are, so people are doomed to be useless assholes forever. So it makes sense why you'd want to get rid of them. Areas. His claim is bolstered by the summer of humanities actions over the last couple thousand years and that time humans have done a lot. They genocide it. A bunch of people destroyed the environment and made this Logan Paul Guy, famous

Speaker 3:          03:27          mankind ruin bid day by day.

Speaker 1:          03:35          So that's the first part of areas. His claim. Now for the second one, one that is much more central to Diana and the film's Arc, the question of who deserves to be saved, even if it's from their own kind. This is distributive justice in aries calculation being saved from death is not something that one is entitled to. It's something that is distributed based on merit as shown by the actions of the individual or in this case the actions of the groups spanning three plus Millennia. This seems to be a pretty common idea among mortals. Diane, his mother Hippolyta tells her, do not deserve you. This all reflects one popular approach to distribute of justice called desert theory, which are used that people deserve things, jobs, money, awards based on their actions rather than on their needs or the benefit it would bring to society. Now, although Diana stays generally consistent in her desire to help humanity, the logic behind this choice develops and changes throughout the film.

Speaker 1:          04:28          And while we see people justifying their actions with distributed or Richard, you'd have frameworks, wonder woman goes a different route. Diana is raised to believe that the amazons have a sacred duty to stop aries and defend the world. So when she sets out for Europe, she's not doing it because she believes humans deserve anything. It's because she has a moral obligation to help. This moral obligation carries her through most of the film. Even as she watches British general send soldiers to their debt, you should be ashamed and Germans taking villagers as slaves. But at some point she realizes that people suck and it wasn't totally areas his fault that they were bayoneting each other. They can stop fighting. Why are they still, cause I've picked up sensor duty was to defend the world from aries and not humans acting on their own accord. She's not really sure where her moral obligations lie anymore.

Speaker 1:          05:16          All of a sudden her mom's wise words sound a whole lot wiser. And my thought was right not to serve yet. Diana's faced with a crisis of conscious. She's no longer bound by duty and her knowledge of human atrocities leader to the conclusion that humans do not merit her help as a matter of justice either. Although Diana makes it less obvious than areas does. She's also motivated by a kind of essential ism. Let's call this the battle of essential isms. Arie says, humans are inherently evil. Diana says they're inherently good. While aries never abandoned his essential ism, Diana does, when she discovers humans can be dick bags all on their own. We don't see too much more of this crisis, but all is resolved by the time she says. At first it might sound like she believes in the love of Steve Trevor, but that doesn't make a ton of sense, so let's give her a little more credit than that.

Speaker 1:          06:08          It's only at the end that it becomes clear to her and to us why saving people is the right thing to do. What differentiates Diana at the end from someone like Captain America is that she realizes it's not her duty to help people. She just wants to because she loves the shit out of humanity. Even though that might sound like a Saccharin care bear cop out, it's not while she leaves behind the ideas of duty and deserving wonder woman taps into a totally different ethical approach. That's pretty unique in the superhero genre. Hair. Epic's care ethics focuses on the relationship between the person who is caring for someone and the person who was terrible. For a good example, a parent who loves their child, even if that child is terrible, or Logan. Paul, unlike most traditional approaches to ethics, Kara ethics rejects universalized principles for how to make judgments or how to act.

Speaker 1:          06:59          Everything is contextualized within the given relationship. However, certain practices are pretty important, like respect, empathy, and attention to the needs of others. Sometimes these relationships are on equal footing, but not always. Wonder woman is not are equal. So it's more like a person caring for a perfect puppy, just like you're not born with an obligation to care for. A dog wonder woman knowingly chooses to enter a relationship of care with people who will never be able to entirely reciprocate and maybe don't deserve it. She isn't pursuing a defined goal other than making the world a better place or holding firm to certain universal principles like that man's idea that killing is always wrong or captain America's belief in the American way. As long as you forget that whole hail hydra thick, she is responding as needed to the needs of those. She cares for him. At the end of the film, Diana's relationship rejects a kind of distributed or retributive justice and instead she makes a choice to love them,

Speaker 2:          07:54          but then I glimpsed the darkness that lives within their lines and learn that inside every one of them there will always be both and now I know only love can truly save the world.

Speaker 1:          08:12          Diana's belief in love isn't a meaningless platitudes. It's a declaration of her commitment to a particular state of mind and action that guides her decisions as a hero. This is clear in her decision not to kill Dr poison despite her being a war criminal and also really creepy

Speaker 2:          08:28          is the perfect example. Pull off these humans. I'm not going to want to be up y'all so proper hear that

Speaker 1:          08:35          although we would be a bit of a stretch to say that wonder woman enters a relationship of care with colonel mustard gas just because she decides not to throw a literal tank at her. It's indicative of Diana's change in mindset. This is visually paralleled by doctor poisons, mass flying off piece by piece as the wind uncovers her true, scarred ugly self. There's a very obvious metaphor and Diana recognizes the complex nature and individual differences of humans.

Speaker 2:          09:00          Everything you say so much

Speaker 1:          09:04          more, even though by most calculations, Dr poison probably deserves to die. Diana rejects the concept of deserving and by extension rejects the desert theory of justice that aries is so fond of every superhero has his or her or its reasons for blowing stuff up and saving the day. Wonder woman defines Diana's ethos of care and solidifies her role in the Justice League for many franchises to come, but it also draws out a frequent theme in comics. The worthiness of the People Save Gotham doesn't deserve Batman and America doesn't deserve Steve Rogers. Wonder woman raises a question that we don't usually hear. Does humanity deserve to be saved at all? And even if they don't, should we save them? Anyway, thanks for watching you guys.
