Speaker 1:          00:00          Ms, this video is brought to you by squarespace. Whether you need a domain, website or online store, make it with squarespace. A wise crack, desperately needs a haircut. Jared here, so we just saw black panther and got to say it's probably one of the better marvel films and the element that elevates it is something rarely seen in the mcu, a complex antagonist, even the best marvel films feature villains that fit the same generic pattern, try to take over the world for reasons that are rarely more complex than they are for Pinky and the brain. Same thing we do every night, pinky try to take over the world. It's just what marvel villains do. Eagle wants to take over the universe because he's egotistical. Hello, wants to take over as guard so she can then take over the nine realms and hydro wants to take over the world because they're literal Nazis, but killmonger is different.

Speaker 1:          00:56          He's got compelling and relatable reasons, motivating his attempt to global conquests. So much so that we found ourselves asking, is killmonger the best superhero villain since the joker? Welcome to this wise crack quick take on marbles. Black Panther, and as always, spoilers ahead, so what motivates, kill longer, simply put, he's seeking retribution for the injustices leveled against people of African descent by Western countries. This includes the obvious like slavery and segregation, but also other wrongs, including redlining in which unfair government loan policies for blacks to live in ghettos and racial profiling by police in which increased patrolling and impoverished black neighborhoods contributes to the mass incarceration of black men in America apply to which current Black Panther writer, Tanahashi coats often writes about, and by the way, if you're interested in hearing more about how coats and other Afro pessimistic views are being expressed in pop culture, I recommend listening to the get out episode of our movie podcast.

Speaker 1:          01:54          Show me the meaning anyway. Though these injustices are only obliquely alluded to in the film, including a humorous bit with sheree calling Bilbo a colonizer. They formed the obvious subtext. Every time killmonger mentions the plight of blacks living outside of Wakanda apply that will conduct, could presumably fix, and this leads to one of the film central questions should Macondo, do more to address the inequities of the outside world initially that will condoms want to maintain their isolation is politics and killmonger wants to conquer the oppressors, thereby colonizing the old colonial powers. This juxtaposition of isolationism versus colonialism is one of several false dichotomies introduced by killmonger that characterize the thematic structure of Black Panther. So what do I mean by false dichotomy throughout the film? Killmonger prompts a number of binaries such as isolationism versus colonialism or traditionalism versus progress, but as the film ultimately reveals, there's no reason to look at these issues as a choice between two absolutes.

Speaker 1:          02:56          There's usually a third way, a middle path between two extremes or what aristotle called the golden mean, and this golden mean defines to Challas character arc to Cholla grows when he learns to avoid the simplistic solutions at the far ends of the spectrum. So let's explore these dichotomies. The first, it's a question of how to construct a group identity, national identity versus racial identity. The people of will conda are extremely nationalistic. They view the world is divided into two groups, will competence and everybody else. This leads to a Wakanda first attitude among many citizens. They've built walls, refused refugees, reject trade and offer no foreign aid all in the name of protecting Wakanda because they value the lives of those who share the same heritage and culture as themselves, but killmonger having grown up in America has developed a strong sense of racial identity for him because we'll condoms have the same skin color as blacks and the rest of the world.

Speaker 1:          03:54          Well condoms should see themselves as part of a global black community. Among the first thing he says when he takes the throne is something like all around the world, people that look like us are suffering in his speech at the United Nations, at the end of the film to Cholla rejects both the Wakandans nationalism and kill mongers ethnicity and instead accepts the middle road offered by humanism. He specifically states that all of humanity is one tribe. It's a surprisingly colorblind message, but a welcome one. The second false dichotomy is traditionalism versus progress. For all its technological advancements. Will conduct is an extremely traditional society, regularly engaging in ancient rituals such as the combat for the crown or the ingesting of the heart shaped herb for killmonger progress requires getting rid of traditions such as when he destroys the garden of heart shaped herbs and refuses to continue the ceremonial combat with the cello. One could even say his philosophy echoes that of Kylo Ren.

Speaker 1:          05:02          The middle ground is keeping what traditions he can, but rejecting what wasn't working specifically, what condos, isolation and its hostility with the Jabari. The film's final dichotomy is the aforementioned isolationism versus colonialism. Most Wakandans believe continuing their centuries old tradition of isolationism to be the most prudent path to maintaining peace, including initially to Cholla. Killmonger on the other hand, subscribes to a theory mentioned frequently in the film that the world is getting smaller and you're either the conquered or the conquerors killmonger solution that will condoms should take part in the same harmful colonialism that's afflicted. Black individuals. For centuries, killmonger seeks to repay historic injustices, tit for tat by arming oppress black communities around the world with advanced weaponry and inciting race riots and radical revolution killmonger. His political philosophy is reminiscent of the French revolution, which was fueled by fantasies of the oppressed, exacting revenge upon their oppressors.

Speaker 1:          06:02          Killmonger is desire for vengeance is so impassioned, but he seems to give no thought to governing after destroying Western society. I like his construction of color and race. This too is a result of his American upbringing. Killmonger story is like that of many African Americans, for whom military service was the only viable path out of poverty, and it was the American military which trained him in the art of regime, change his time in the special forces having been spent overseeing various coups and conquests in the Middle East. Not only does this result in him being more interested in revolution than actual rule, it's also darkly ironic. He wants to colonize the so called colonizers because that's what the colonizers taught him to do. This is part of what makes killmonger such a sympathetic villain, and yes, he is a villain. Unlike the Challah, he doesn't look for the golden mean, he's an extremist in both his beliefs and violent methodologies, but this extremism is painted as a direct result of Western society grappling with it's messy.

Speaker 1:          07:04          Past killmonger is a dark reflection of the sins of our forefathers justice. He blamed for the actions of his father to Chaka. He blames everyone else for their ancestors actions as well, but to Cholla rejects this when he says to them [inaudible], that he is not responsible for past what condon, kings mistreatment of the Jabari people and while to Cholla doesn't deny the wrongdoings of westerners past. He acts without animosity toward their present, a descendants. It's this optimism which allows to challah to chart a course between the extremes of isolationism and conquest by the films and to Challah is persuaded by killmonger that there is a need for Wakanda to provide global aid and assistance just without the violent conquest. The movie closes with the Child Building and outreach center in Oakland to help the people that kill monger was fighting for, and that's what makes killmonger is such a phenomenal villain.

Speaker 1:          07:55          Whereas most bad guys represent a clear cut, evil that must be unilaterally defeated. Killmonger is disposition is one that must be adopted. Killmonger doesn't just challenge our protagonists, he guides them and provides them with the insight team needs to become a truly great king in the face of very divisive issues. The child is able to synthesize these solutions in a way that works best for Wakanda and the world. It's like Afro Futuristic, Hagle.
