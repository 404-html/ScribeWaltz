Speaker 1:          00:10          What's it, the, the biggest challenge is that the, the method that has worked so well for economics is probably close to its limits. Economics has gotten a tremendous amount of mileage about by saying what would a rational self interested person do. That has been the core and for very many things that has been a very productive way. You learn enormous amount and, and it serves as the basis not just for abstract theories but for actual empirical analysis of behavior and of policy. But

Speaker 2:          00:44          okay,

Speaker 1:          00:45          in a way we've sort of,

Speaker 2:          00:48          okay.

Speaker 1:          00:48          Done what you can do with that. And more and more the key issues in economics, um, are involved. The limits of rationality involve the places where people don't have the ability to assess all of the data they have where people aren't, don't make rational choices. There is a rapidly growing field of behavioral economics, which is based what that means. I mean there's no like an hour's behavioral, but what that means to the economist is that means okay, we, people are apparently not, you know, maximizing your utility function, the way you columnists slight to assume, which is actually a very, very good way to understand a lot of human behavior, but they appear to be doing something else. And so all of those approaches is trying to understand what people actually do. That's a, that's behavioral and a, and we're learning a lot. It's, it's more of, it doesn't have a single, you know, it doesn't, can't be summarized in 10 words.

Speaker 1:          01:39          Uh, which is why it wasn't done first. But I think we're learning a lot, but so it's, that's a research program. It's fine. Boy influencing policy, you know, that's the labors of sisyphus. You A, you push it up a little bit, comes back down. Each generation has to do its bit. I don't think there's any, you know, there will never be a point at which good economic analysis is automatically incorporated into policy. It takes each generation to try and push it. And, um, we, I think we're doing better. I think this generation is, is doing better now than it did 10 years ago. We'll see how, how it, how it goes in, but you know, the next generation will feel the same frustration.
