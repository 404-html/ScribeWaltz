Speaker 1:          00:02          A wise crack flesh, jared, again, before we get into it, just a note, we didn't do a quick take last week because, well, while the world early conspiracy was one of our favorite episodes of the season, we didn't really have much to add to the discussion, but we're back to take on season three, episode six, where we'll be looking at the toxic side of our favorite adventuring duo. I really love this episode for two reasons. First, they manage to address the kind of character development we crave in a way that's both satisfying and the exact opposite of what regular TV does. And second, they tap into some really interesting ideas about mental health. So fire your therapist and join me on this quick take of rest and relaxation. A quick recap, rick and morty need a break from almost dying all the time. This was insane. That was pure luck. I was not in control of that situation at all

Speaker 1:          00:52          and come to the realization that they're burned out. So they vacation at an alien spa and take a mental detoxifier for a spin while the dual fuel cleanse and rejuvenated they leave behind the parts they hate most about themselves. Morning continues to live his life without these sense of crippling self doubt becomes the most popular kid in school and even lands a date with Jessica. Meanwhile, Rick seems like a normal human being. Excuse me, but this new reality is interrupted as the toxic versions of themselves managed to escape and turn the whole world a weird as we praise our loving father. July, we made them up. One of the cleverest aspects of this episode is what I'm going to call anti character development. As we've mentioned before, Dan Harmon is a strict adherence to his version of Joseph Campbell's the hero's journey. Now, the relevant part here is that many stories use protagonists confronting their shadow.

Speaker 1:          01:46          It kind of dark reflection of themselves that they must overcome like Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde in terms of character development. This overcoming usually means arch euro has some new insight on life, like when a compassionate Logan sacrifices himself battling the murderous x 24, overcoming his selfishness, or when Luke Skywalker's spares darth vader overcoming his temptation toward the dark side. This episode uses this structure toxic Mourdian toxic. Rick are quite literal shadow versions of themselves, but instead of overcoming their toxic personality traits, this episode is a journey to reunite with their worst selves. Excuse me. Healthy morty is a smooth operator with lots of friends who ultimately needs to rediscover his self-loathing and healthy. Ric is a thoughtful, super genius who needs to rediscover his narcissism and irrational care for morty. If anything, the regular kind of character development, normally I would come down on any kind of disruption, but it seems to represent a positive change for your character is pretty creepy, but I also think this anti character development serves as a pretty smart commentary on mental health in our society.

Speaker 1:          02:55          Rest and Rick laxation asks, what does it mean to be mentally word around school as you've become super healthy? In many ways, this episode serves as an extended parody of certain healthy attitudes promoted by self help Gurus, popular media, and the occasional life purpose cheerleader. I swear they exist in La. Focus on the good things. Trust me. Things are good. In particular, this idea that we must strive to eliminate any thoughts that are unpleasant or painful. Hashtag positive vibes. Hashtag selfcare. Hashtag blessed Hashtag. Sorry dot sorry. Now there are a ton of installation tools will tell you that being mentally healthy means uncritically loving yourself, saying yes to everything, counting your blessings and believing in yourself, no matter how stupid your passive income scheme is. However, Rick and morty shows us that these ideals fully embodied will make you seem like a coked out Weirdo.

Speaker 1:          03:46          You know, you're so quiet. What's wrong? Why don't you tell me about yourself? What's the atmosphere like on Planet Jessica? I think one of the ideas of the show is getting at is something sociologists, William Davies has written about in his book the happiness industry. For our longtime fans, we actually talked about this book and our inside out video. Demis writes about a concept he calls compulsory happiness that in our modern world there exists a kind of alliance between corporations, managers, and advertisers to promote a definition of mental health that ultimately serves the capitalist society, that we live in a kind of happiness that involves cheerfully accepting the status quo. Something touched on by rick before because I don't respect therapy. I think it's helped a lot of people get comfortable and start panicking, which is a state of mind. We value in the animals who eat this kind of happiness also requires constant self improvement for the sake of being a better consumer.

Speaker 1:          04:35          Let's work off your trauma with some urban spin yoga. It's amazing. You do yoga on a bike, but you have an at risk preteen. I think I can just blow this off. Morning, we see morty spouting platitudes that seemed lifted from a Tony Robbins book. I love drums. I never took drum lessons. Why? Limitations? We are addicted to our own limitations. How amazing is that demanding that everyone around him partake in his new lifestyle? You have to do this detox thing. I did. Is that an alien spa? You go through it and when confronted with real life problems like a scented part of himself being trapped in hell, his answer is, trust me. Things are good. Taking that away from me, that wouldn't be healthy. The problem with this is that many of the things the self help industry wants you to erase like self doubt and sadness are pretty important.

Speaker 1:          05:19          In the case of Morty, it can hold you back from becoming a full on sociopath and a sociopath. He becomes in a scene lifted from the wolf of Wall Street. It looks like healthy. Morty is at the top of his game as an unscrupulous stockbroker, handholds biotech million and a half at 33 with a new hot redhead to replace Jessica. Rick even compares him to another sociopathic Wall Street fat cat with too much self esteem. Sorry, tiny American psycho. So what about rick? Rick realizes some of these less desirable parts of ourselves, despite the pain they caused are essential to actually being healthy. Do the healthy thing, and voluntarily read toxify yourself. Jessica even tells marty good to have you back suggesting them mortise authentic self hating self is truly his better self, but my only complaint with this episode is, well, it doesn't really make sense.

Speaker 1:          06:12          We're meant to believe that the undesirable parts of a person are purged from their being based on their own subjective definition of toxicity. How could that detox machine know the difference between healthy and sick? For everything that goes through it, it can't. It must be by the individual's own definition of toxicity. Yet healthy rig says this to morty. I'm real proud to be your grandpa. Morning then later claims that his attachment to morty is irrational, therefore toxic and allows him to nonchalantly do this. So is his love for morty toxic or healthy. Well, for more thoughts on that, be sure to check out the squash our very own rick and morty podcast.
