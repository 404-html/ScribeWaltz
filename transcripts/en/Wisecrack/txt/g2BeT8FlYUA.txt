Speaker 1:          00:06          Hey guys, Helen here, wisecracks resident science nerd. Well, 14 year old. Jared was waiting in line seven hours early for the matrix reloaded. I was playing with my star wars action figures, acting out weird love triangles between on Django and Princess Leia and trying to convince my family that my home planet was actually older on, so I decided to flex my star wars geekery for this discussion of Disney's latest installment in the star wars cinematic universe solo. The movie fills in the backstory of our favorite smuggler, turned hero showing us how a young Han transforms into the legendary Han Solo, sort of given that the other films have been massive cash cows solo was expected to do pretty well even considering the last jet I backlash and potential franchise fatigue, but solo flopped. It's on track to be the first unprofitable star wars film ever. They should surprise you for one reason.

Speaker 1:          00:57          Everything about this movie is designed to be marketable and give you the warm fuzzies, so what went wrong? Let's take a look in this wisecrack addition on how even psychology couldn't sell solo thanks to our sponsor, brilliant.org for making this video possible, and as always, spoilers solo kicks off sometime around the year 13 bb, why that's 30 to 64 on the lawful calendar and ends roughly 10 years before rogue one and a new hope. The movie follows aspiring pilot and [inaudible] to be Han as he goes from a bright eyed romantic to an outlaw who shoots first.

Speaker 2:          01:32          Alright,

Speaker 1:          01:34          along the way, he picks up a level below 190 year old Wiki, a notorious techno sexual smuggler, and the Millennium Falcon doesn't quite pull off the Kessel run in less than 12 parsecs unless you round down. Here's Solos, fundamental strategy, make us nostalgic for the good old days of star wars by cramming in as many Easter eggs and nods to the past our wars as possible. There's the golden dice, the planet Solutia Viper droids, mandalorian armor, Jabba the Hutt boss, the bounty hunter, Colo crawfish, and of course darth Maul, and that's just scratching the surface. The movie is one Easter Egg. After the next pulling references, not only from the films but also from the novelizations, the video games and the animated series, the reference to Rsa, Lando skies from return of the Jedi and cure is impressive. Command of terrorist Khasi are great ways to make fans who know two generations worth of star wars lore feel like they have a special connection to the film, but despite the outstanding fan service and some great deep cuts, the movie falls short because nostalgia alone can't propel a film and might even get in the way.

Speaker 1:          02:36          Well, I can't read Disney's mind. The reason they relied on all this nostalgia seems pretty obvious. Marketers use nostalgia to sell stuff all the time and it's no different in movies. Just look at the force awakens. Besides bringing back the actual characters and actors from the original trilogy, the film paid homage to its predecessors in the form of things like trash compactors, pod racing, flags, and even that Werewolf alien thing from the Mos. Cantina neuroscience has a possible explanation for why this trick can be super effective. It involves the brain's reward system. Some imaging studies have shown that the parts of the brain tied to feelings like pleasure, motivation and euphoria are activated when you're experiencing a stalled jet, so for long time star wars fans, seeing things like Han's dice and hearing the sound of the ethereal fighters or like a jump to hyperspace for the feel good pathways in your brain, which is exactly what Disney wants to happen because then you'll keep coming back for more or buy some solo dice cufflinks and a tee shirt, but nostalgia. Marketing aside, these Easter eggs do something else in the case of humor. Being on the receiving end of an inside joke makes us feel more affiliation with the jokester and makes them seem more socially desirable.

Speaker 1:          03:48          I understood that reference and according to the encryption theory of humor, jokes are funny, not just because of their superficial content, but because they broadcast shared knowledge between the person and their audience. So if you caught yourself laughing in the scene where is losing it over being beaten at Gerrick or the one where he's holding up the guard severed arms. The writers did their job from a psychology standpoint. The fact that Disney shares your inside knowledge that peoples' arms off makes you feel like they get it. Droid don't pull people's arms out of their sockets when they lose, but here's where solo lands itself in trouble. Plenty of movies have inside jokes and references will also giving us well developed characters, but in the process of doubling down on the stall did Easter eggs. Disney fails to give us a legit origin story. Solos. Fundamental problem is that Alden Ehrenreich has to convince us.

Speaker 1:          04:43          He's Harrison Ford's Han Solo from the very start. He's got the arrogance, the wisecracks, the hustle hard, supposed to transition is basically 75 percent complete right from the beginning, so by the time he shoots back at the end, it doesn't seem like much of a change. He's been acting like Harrison Ford the whole time. The film makes gestures of a transformation, but they seem halfhearted when cram between 8,000 other nostalgia triggers as a result for a film that promises to showcase a development of one of the most beloved characters and Saifai history. It feels more like a buzzfeed top 10 list of Han Solo Trivia, even significant plot points like the way Han gets his last name meets Lando or winds the Millennium Falcon. Feel like Easter eggs take Han's relationship with chewy Han's, only known him for a couple of minutes before the relationship has the same dynamic as it does throughout the rest of the saga.

Speaker 1:          05:34          Normally we'd expect this kind of connection to develop and mature over time, but because Disney's top priority was to trigger nostalgia and familiarity rather than the truly show development, it ends up feeling shallow. The movie gets it out of the way and moves onto the next bit of Trivia. The point of an origin story is to show us how a character we know and love comes to be who they are. For Batman Begins Shows Bruce Wayne mastering his fears to become the legendary dark night. Bruce starts out as a troubled, angsty, scared youth at the beginning and by the end he's disciplined and unafraid. Dr. strange starts off as a self centered surgeon who only believes in cold rationality and ends the film as a self sacrificial mystic. But to be honest, I kind of get it when you're recasting such an iconic role, you can stuck between a rock and a hard place. If Hans antiques at the beginning seemed completely different than Harrison Ford, the audience wouldn't believe they were watching Han Solo. But if you have him act like Ford Solo from the beginning, you sacrifice a convincing arc for familiarity. If we were to try to give the fillmore credit, we might say that the arc is Han going from an aspiring scoundrel to an idealist when he decides to hand over the hyper fuel to the budding resistance. But isn't that the exact same arc from a new foe?

Speaker 1:          06:51          At worst, the film has no work and at best it's a retread of episode four. That's not to say solo doesn't have moments of fun, but that's really the best thing you could say about it and hey, if that's what you're looking for, it's a good time. But in our opinion, Disney could have done better by delivering an intriguing character rather than relying on Cipa Pilsen a soldier in the form of endless Easter eggs. But that's our take. Leave us yours in the comments below. On the other hand, if you'd rather work hard for your dopamine hits, see if you can solve this riddle. If I were to tell you that the combined area of the blue triangles is 25 and the five red squares are identical, what does the area of the entire shape pull out some scrap paper if you need it.
