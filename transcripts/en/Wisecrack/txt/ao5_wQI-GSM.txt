Speaker 1:          00:00          This video is brought to you by Skillshare, a wise crack jared in the pale flesh. Again, today we've got an episode for you about Pokemon go, urban exploration and some dead French guy, fusion, pokemon go temporarily gripped the world like an epidemic. The augmented reality mobile game, just days after it's released, was installed in five percent of all android devices and even surpassed tinder in downloads. To say that we were gripped by Pocomania all over again is an understatement. The media and now wisecrack just wouldn't shut up about it. Pokemon goers have discovered dead bodies been lured into being robbed, crash their cars, and even trolled the Westboro Baptist church. At the same time, plenty of people were less than an hammered by Pokemongo filmmaker Oliver Stone decried the games ramp in data collection as a new form of surveillance capitalism. He also warned that the idea of people running around to catch imaginary monsters as dictated by a giant corporation can go by another name, totalitarianism, so it's Pokemongo a nightmare.

Speaker 1:          01:07          Confluence of phone addiction and corporate surveillance. Maybe let's find out. Welcome to this wise crack addition on the philosophy of pokemon go, and for once no spoilers ahead at its heart, pokemon go is a game about walking you saunter to a pokey stop dash towards a raid stampede towards a dragonite trespass into a neighbor's yard, stumble into a crime scene, and so on, and while walking may seem as philosophically unimportant as an Adam Sandler movie, you'd be surprised, but before we can understand how pokemon go radically changes how we interact with physical spaces, we need a little history of walking. Unsurprisingly, walking played a prominent role in society until the rise of the automobile, besides getting people from point a to point b, walking was a sort of sport and aristocratic circles as Frederic Gros writes in his book, a philosophy of walking well to do. Men and women would stroll around in fancy clothes, occasionally striking a pose to woo potential suitors.

Speaker 1:          02:06          It was kind of like the physical manifestation of rich people. Selfies on Instagram for others, walking was a holy matter every year. Scores of people would undergo a pilgrimage to various sanctified sites. Meanwhile, philosophers like Friedrich Nietzsche saw walking as an invaluable part of the philosophical process today are walking and movement in general still serves a social function, though it's a little more pragmatic. Now, our morning commute running to the grocery store, picking up sunny Jim from soccer practice. Most of these comings and goings are programmed into our daily lives. We move from place to place, generally unaware of our surroundings and never venture far from our planned route all to fulfill our societal obligations as gross writes this kind of rushing around is always in the service of doing something and never to just be walking according to gross is in its purest form about doing nothing which allows us to rediscover the simple joy of existing I kind of childlike wonderment with the world surrounding us.

Speaker 1:          03:09          Some might argue that pokemongo according to this logic, follows the always doing something logic of our time frantically running from pokestop to pokey. Stop chasing down legendary rates and battling. Kim's isn't exactly the kind of exploration grosses, writing about. We'll tackle that in just a second, but first let's talk about space. Every street building and open space carries with it and assumed social code wouldn't behave in an office building the same way you would at a concert. You don't play football and freeway and many would say it's important to wear your black sabbath tee shirt to church, but those social codes change with time and culture. Public bathing used to be a thing. Bars used to be a place to find a date and rivers used to be a fine place for you to drop, trow and do your business. Pokemon go and the technology it uses might change everything by radically recoding.

Speaker 1:          04:02          This space that we live in the game has literally mapped onto reality and entirely new set of social codes, parks for hiking now, more like a sweet place to battle of Mutu churches for worship now, pokey balls for days and it crowd all running in the same direction could be a Zombie apocalypse, but it could also be an unknown museums to memorialize the millions of people slaughtered more like, okay, seriously, don't play pokemon go and the Holocaust museum in short, Pokemongo disrupts how we perceive space. There's a common fear with pokemon go, should we really trust a massive corporation with such intimate knowledge of where we're going and how we're getting there? Is it a little scary that a company can so artfully tell us where to go? Niantic has integrated sponsored pokey stops and starbucks, for instance, was more than happy to oblige. The idea is you get to buy a Pumpkin Spice Latte once you've decided to take a break from catching mythical monsters so far, aside from some sponsored pokey sops, that intake has taken the high road organizing things like beach cleanups for Earth Day, but that doesn't mean it can't go downhill fairly quickly.

Speaker 1:          05:16          What if you could pay niantic a couple million dollars to have a rare pokemon spawn at your political rally or worse, your friends Improv show for French philosopher, Guy Debord. Modern capitalism has neatly organized time and physical space. Where we are, where we're going and when we're getting there is a function of the totalizing control. The economy plays in our lives. We traveled through life, mesmerized by our commodity filled environment. We go to work to make money to a leisure activity, to spend money, go home, go to sleep, and repeat with a sort of systemic pressure to do this in a more and more productive way. Work harder, enjoy more sleepless. You get the idea for some pokemon go, easily fits this dystopic narrative. Yesterday, we were mesmerized by billboards and where they told us to go probably to some tgi Friday's today. We're mesmerized by our phone screens and where they tell us to go.

Speaker 1:          06:12          What's missing from all this is chance, randomness and discovery, but before you think we're being overly paranoid, edge Laura's those who decry pokemon go as the harbinger of some dystopic, augmented reality are only half right, Pokemongo as Edwin Montoya's rewrites in the Hong Kong. Review of books resembles deary. A revolutionary strategy proposed by debord to combat the entrenched and alienated ways in which we move through cities do receive, which is French, for drifting means abandoning the preprogrammed way in which we interact with cities. By performing a sort of experiment in space, wandering around aimlessly, debord encourages people to walk around, be drawn in by their surroundings, interrogate them, and to give themselves up to randomness, and that's kind of what pokemon go does. Players venture to locations they never would have dreamed of going to namely outside, but if you're anything like me, you've discovered new neighborhoods, new landmarks, and even this one's a shocker.

Speaker 1:          07:13          Made friends in the myspace. Pokemon go is combating the kind of social alienation that our culture actively promotes. Well, most games have you glued to a screen with headphones on. Pokemon go encourages you to explore and make new friends. After the raid system was introduced, you could battle boss level pokemon for a limited time with friends or strangers. They also recently rolled out trading, adding new ways to meet new people. Psychologists, we've been noticed that the game was helping their patients with anxiety and depression by getting them to get out of the house and socialize in this way, pokemon go actively recode's the space around us in a positive way. It might not be exactly the kind of revolutionary walking that debord envision or the useless kind of walking gross writes about, but it's also better than the alternative that are tech obsessed society offers us.

Speaker 1:          08:04          Who knows? Maybe pokemon go is a gateway drug for hiking and social interaction. What do you think wise crack is pokemon go's society, savior or a harbinger of disciple times to come? Or is it just a game about animals and balls? Let us know what to think in the comments and as always, thanks for watching. Hey wisecrack. It's Alec Polka Master. Extraordinary reading.
