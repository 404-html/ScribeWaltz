Speaker 1:          00:08          I think the celebrity chef phenomenon has been, has gone on way longer than I expected it to be honest. Um, uh, I have worked at a couple of big food magazines, food and wine and bon appetit in particular, and I'm the celebrity chef phenomenon really started in the early to mid eighties. It really kind of exploded at that time. Really led by people like emeril. And um, I think it's been fantastic for food. I really do it because it exposed people to different cuisines and cultures and brought everyone's palate's up tremendously. I do think it's time for farmers to be the new celebrity chefs. I really do. I think that, um, they're kind of connection, a vital connection to the food is so crucial and that they need to be getting more of our claims and our love and thanks. And, um, while the chefs are a huge and important conduit to translating those ingredients, it has, it all starts with the farmer and I would really like the farmer to be the next celebrity chef.
