Speaker 3:          03:41          It's a simple calculus. This universe is finite. It's resources finite. If life has left, done shirked, life will cease to exist

Speaker 1:          03:50          and ain't calculus and I should know I failed it twice. This approach. His sentiments from English scholar Thomas Mouth is are slithering and his essay on the principles of human population. Martha's are believe that population could be contained through two methods, proactive checks that increased mortality rates and preventative checks that decreased birth rates such as condoms and birkenstocks, but like any good movie villain, Fenos chooses the option that leads to more toy sales. Fantas is a played Tony. He invades plantings. He takes what he wants. He wipes out half the population and doing so. Thanatos employees, the old utilitarian argument that moral choices maximize happiness for the maximum amount of people. By this logic murdering half the population is preferable to the whole population killing itself.

Speaker 3:          04:41          You were in the bed hungry, scrounging for scraps. Your planet was on the brink of collapse. I'm the one who stopped that. You know what's happened since then? The children born have known nothing but full bellies and clear skies. It's a paradise,

Speaker 1:          04:59          although he could make the universe twice as big. Screw it. Ultimately, the film criticizes both tennis's unchecked might and his utilitarian ideals, but not his weird tunic and boot Combo is quest for power. Forces him to choose between ambition and Familia.

Speaker 3:          05:17          The hardest choices require the strongest wounds.

Speaker 1:          05:21          While he achieves his goal, it costs him everything he holds dear. Namely his daughter who's tried to murder him on multiple occasions. Earthlink cinema. I'm Garrick's where I'm your lawyer and now a word from my weird intern.

Speaker 4:          05:36          Hey guys, Gareth's is turn. Jared here. My friends are always asking me what it's like to work for Garrick's. Well, it can be tough. Technically I'm not even allowed to have friends. The only thing that gets me through is Garrick's is awesome collection of vintage earth artifacts like his oculus rift from 2018 back then it cost a mere $399 but as fond of saying at dinner parties, it's priceless. Now, Garrick's has tons of games too, including marvel powers, united vr, Lone Echo, brass tactics, echo arena, and it seems like he's always getting more. Unfortunately, I'm forbidden to use it. And Derek's busted me when I thought he was speaking at an intergalactic convention of Earth of files. So now I'm trapped down here in his basement for what he describes as eternity. Oh, well, it was worth it. Check out the link in the video description to get more info on how to pick up one of your own. If you can time travel back to 2018 that is.
