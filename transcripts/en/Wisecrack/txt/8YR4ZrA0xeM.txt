Speaker 1:          00:00          This video is brought to you by verve. Hey, wise crack Helen here. So jarrod's taking a breather this month, which means I have the honor of telling you guys all about one of the most beloved and Van Request An enemies in wise crack history. Cowboy Bebop, yes, we're finally doing it. So what's taken us so long? Well, when we sat down to analyze what makes cowboy bebop stow amazing from it's super fluid fight scenes too, it's insane. Grab bag of a soundtrack. We kept running into the same problem. Every episode is a kaleidoscope of references, philosophies, narratives and forms. It seems downright impossible to pull on just one thread. Then around the beginning of season two we noticed this interstitial, yeah, it might be hard to read, but it says then in 2071 in the universe, the bounty hunters who are gathering in spaceship Bebop, we'll play freely without fear of risky things.

Speaker 1:          01:01          They must create new dreams and films by breaking traditional styles. The work which becomes a new genre itself will be called Cowboy bebop. If those last two sentences about breaking traditional styles and creating a new genre that really gave us pause. See, cowboy bebop isn't just about great characters and deep thoughts. It's about blurring the line between three distinct genres, Saifai, westerns and no arm. So welcome to this wise crack addition on cowboy bebop and you guessed it, spoilers ahead. And thanks again to our sponsor. [inaudible] throw your one stop shop for Anamae science fiction and so much more. If you're a cowboy bebop fan, be sure to check out their new show, kill joys to get your bounty hunters in space fix for a free 30 day trial, go to [inaudible] dot com slash wise crack. Now back to the show. First a quick refresher course set in the year 2071 cowboy bebop follows a group of starving bounty hunters who wonder from planet to planet looking for their next meal ticket.

Speaker 1:          02:00          There's jet, a former detective who's rocking the robocop look on his left arm spike, a modern take on the Marlboro man mixed with the tragic mob back story. They authentic, they tall dealing with gambling problems and a serious case of Amnesia. And, um, ed, who's a brilliant hacker. But really, yeah, she's just it together in more or less episodic fashion. The team hunts down fugitives while shoveling down some pretty meager meals aside from an ongoing fight with hunger. The first thread you'll notice in cowboy bebop is its unique take on the side by genre. The show challenges our idea of Scifi, but presenting a future that doesn't really have much to do with the future. Sure. There are all the familiar trappings here after the destruction of a giant space portal that lets you travel the universe at and your lightspeed earth has been left near uninhabitable and mankind has spread throughout the universe.

Speaker 1:          02:55          And for those of you who grew up on things like star wars or Gundam Wing, you'll notice a medley of conventions, epic space battles check terrifying, mysterious alien creatures. Check space terrorist. Sure why not. But the longer you inhabit the world of Cowboy Bebop, the more you realize it's brand of Scifi isn't about portraying the future. In fact, it feels more like the 90s and it does 2071 cities here aren't the shining beacons on the hill. That future is and promised us. Instead they're dirty, almost run down. Hell. There's a whole space colony full of drifters and riff raff and technology isn't exactly 70 years ahead of its time either. Take session seven for example, heavy metal queen in it, we see the ins and outs of space transportation through the lens of the best truck or there is the tea, but it quickly becomes apparent that much hasn't changed for future trucking.

Speaker 1:          03:46          Space trucks are still adorned with hood ornaments. Their cabins are still cramps to cedars crammed with personal knickknacks. They even communicate via radio add though on La [inaudible] whole new [inaudible] radio people and when it's time to wind down there, relax at crappy rest stops, which look identical to the ones I've seen in west Tennessee. So what's going on here? What are we to make of Psi Phi that doesn't really make use of the science part in a flashier way as wise crack favorite ray Bradbury tells us, science fiction is the fiction of revolutions. Revolutions in time, space, medicine, travel and thought. Above all, science fiction is the fiction of warm blooded human men and women sometimes elevated and sometimes crushed by their machines. In other words, at the heart of any good Saifai story then are the people and their stories in which machines are only apart Bradbury's.

Speaker 1:          04:42          Words go a long way in explaining why we continually see stories and cowboy bebop that are surprisingly light on the technology that surrounds them. Perhaps there's no better example of this then Fay Valentine. In many ways, Faye is a victim of sciences progress. When she and her family traveled to space aboard their private shuttle, something goes horribly wrong. Leaving Fay as the only survivor about her injuries are so severe, the doctors decide to cryogenically free sir until she can be saved by later medical advancements. Over 50 years pass and Faye is awoken by the questionably named physician doctor Baucus except there's only one problem. Dallas. It they all had to go to dona. Yup. She lost her memory worse because the gate exploded while she was frozen. There's no surviving data on who fay even was before.

Speaker 2:          05:32          Id this, what are the juvenile machine [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          05:44          and did we mention she's now drowning in debt checky had I not done yet. Despite science and technology nearly screwing Fay at every turn, they story is never folded into a warning about the future or it's technology instead. Phase journey is all about finding a place to belong, a pretty common literary trope across all genres at the sea. [inaudible] yeah,

Speaker 1:          06:20          two button. Sure. Elements of science fiction setup, phase narrative, but at the end of the day they're just silent cues that help move the conflict along by letting science elements do their work in the background. Cowboy bebop really thrust its characters into the spotlight, which is maybe why with only 10 out of 26 episodes exploring our heroes, personal stories, we're still able to relate so much to them. Seriously. Guys who did not feel like crying when phages lies down in the wreckage of her childhood home. But saifai isn't the only genre cowboy bebop works in. Yeah, if the title wasn't enough of a dead giveaway. Cowboy bebop also plays heavily with western conventions more than anything. The first session, asteroid blues really sets the tone and the episode Jen and Spike Hunt Down the drug dealer asthma of Solon son and his girlfriend catarina in Tiawana there saloon fights and Stetson hats. Indigenous wise men, we even see spike wearing a Poncho and Sombrero at one point and true to form even the episodes ending itself is an homage to classic western themes. Catarina realizing the jet and the authorities are closing in on them. The sides to take drastic action.

Speaker 1:          07:41          Adios. As literary critic Peter French notes. While rare when suicide is depicted in Westerns, it has shown to be the escape of the week or the defeated. For French, though nothing characterizes westerns more than death and that's particularly true in cowboy bebop, French rights. The Western is about a dead man's walk or run or Gallup. It is not accidental that so many of the heroes and villains of Westerns are portrayed as having a previous history in the American civil war on the losing confederate side. They have been defeated and lift with death and Gore in a cause. They we are led to believe, saw either as they're inescapable duty or as romantic. So you're a man's only good for one. All did at time. I took mine to the confederate states of America today, Joe Sam. This concept of a dead man's walk becomes particularly relevant with spike just as Western heroes aimlessly wander through life carrying the burden of the romantic cause, which has now been extinguished so to, to spike meander through life, carrying his tragic romance with him, a romance that almost killed him. The first detail we learn about spike is that he's already died once before my

Speaker 3:          08:56          mouth. Duh. What did I [inaudible] [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          09:01          a former Hitman for the Red Dragon Syndicate. Spike wanted to escape with the love of his life. Julia after performing one last job except Julianne never showed up and the spikes partner, well, let's just say he's named vicious for a reason. In the end, spike barely managed to escape with his life, with everyone in his old life believing he died. But instead of washing his hands of everything spike holds on old in all Nola just as French described with Westerns, spike can never fully tear himself away from his bloody past. Whether it's to bring a bounty on his former boss, wall socket, Walmart, mono cause she said when you got or to chase after the woman he loves or to settle the score with vicious spike returns time and time again to his past. Considering Spike nearly dies every time he runs after his past. We've got to wonder what duty could be so important, especially since he once told Faye that the past doesn't matter anymore.

Speaker 4:          10:02          Dakota,

Speaker 3:          10:05          golden winkeljohn and Blah,

Speaker 4:          10:07          doug about

Speaker 1:          10:09          cargo, all the water meter you out with that all well, digging deeper into the genre, the answer isn't too much of a stretch. As literary critic Jane Tompkins notes in her book west of everything. The heroes and villains of Westerns aren't concerned with traditional Judeo Christian ethics. The harsh reality of the desert and they're outlawed in lifestyles won't allow it. Instead, their moral code revolves around honor as French elaborates. What after all is the value of residents in the Kingdom of Heaven? If the cost is one self respect, we see this in almost every character from spikes past but most vividly in a vicious, vicious ever. The sociopath holds a mite is right attitude. Those who can't or won't fight according to vicious shouldn't be allowed to live. It's the reason why he killed his boss and later stage to coop. It's also the reason why he seeks to kill spike, the man who has renounced his violent past.

Speaker 3:          11:02          We'll wait. [inaudible] this new shoe modeling. Some of you came on though so much trouble. Son Christopher Nolan,

Speaker 1:          11:17          but even vicious, seemingly wants a fair fight with spike. He passed up easy opportunities to kill his mortal foe when spike was passed out on one of Jupiter's moons. This just leaves him unharmed, mostly tall. No, I'm not at the home and when spike and vicious or in their final duel, they both passed their own preferred weapons to each other instead of either taking the advantage. As for spike, his decision to kill vicious isn't about him being a serious piece of shit. In part, it's about writing a personal wrong Julia's death as French reminds us, the hero of a western is not the cowboy equivalent of the caped crusader. The wrongs must always relate to some harm suffered either by him directly or by someone with whom he has established a relationship, but there's also a more philosophical reason behind spikes decision and it has to do with skepticism. Since leaving the syndicate, Spike has wondered if he ever really survived at all wondering if what he saw was real cuddle. No real

Speaker 1:          12:17          did you call, didn't have Christmas Day cutoff. [inaudible] called the hold on medical call me day. Many me fucking I came to Janae specifically. Spike continually floats the idea that everything he sees could just be a dream. [inaudible] emailed me. In this sense, spike echoes the skepticism of ancient Chinese philosopher lungs up who roped. Once upon a time I [inaudible] was a butterfly fluttering hither and thither. To all intents and purposes, a butterfly. I was conscious only of my happiness as a butterfly on aware that I was one zone. Soon I awake and there I was there to bleed myself again. Now I do not know whether I was then a man dreaming I was a butterfly or whether I am now a butterfly dreaming I am a man spike struggling to make sense of life before and after the syndicate wonders if maybe he never really left the syndicate at all. He wonders if he really died that night. It's only after losing the love of his life that he accepts the cruel reality of the situation. He's been awake the whole time. [inaudible] it's anybody can submit you for spike. His dead man's walk isn't just to take revenge on vicious. It's paradoxically to show himself that he's awake or as he tells Fay shitty new coworkers. Nay.

Speaker 5:          13:48          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          13:48          Putting a halt on each to Ricardo car. And while it's up for debate, whether spike dies after his final fight with vicious, I've got to say, spike would make clint eastwood proud by storming vicious his hideout. Oh. And wondering why vicious and spike and go at it with the Katana and a pistol and the whole fight still feels believable. Yeah. It's because Ronin films, you know, Japanese period pieces that followed the loan. Samurai dispensing personal justice are pretty much the cultural equivalent of Westerns. In fact, from the epic one, men armies to the tent silence before the dual westerns in Ronan's have created a fairly shared visual and thematic identity. But that's another video. Finally, the third and perhaps most notable genre cowboy bebop works in is no are strangely no. Our is notoriously hard for film critics to define. For example, Raymond Board and Etienne show Matam defined it in their seminal text, a panorama of American film, the war as having five feet characteristics, dreamlike, strange, erotic, ambivalent, and cruel, but many popular noir.

Speaker 1:          14:49          Our films don't hit all the marks while every character is influenced by film noir. Jimmy. No, he's telling me it's the book. Can you come by? I think the genre has the greatest pool on Faye and jet. Sorry. Spike thing is clearly a femme fatale one, a film noirs favorite conventions. See one film, no, our first captured the popular imagination following World War II. There were few representations of women that depicted them as anything other than swooning, fainting, walking pairs of ovaries. But as literary scholar, Jamie place notes, no war changed that and became one of the few periods of film in which women are active, not static. Symbols are intelligent and powerful if destructively so and derive power, not weakness from their sexuality. They is definitely intelligent, powerful in sexual. She's constantly one step ahead of her male peers.

Speaker 4:          15:44          Gee, you took on a [inaudible] [inaudible] na gene Kolkata dinner

Speaker 1:          15:55          and she isn't above using her sexuality to get what she wants.

Speaker 4:          16:04          That's good.

Speaker 1:          16:11          And whilst some like critic Julie Grossman have criticized the trope for being an overly simplistic reduction of lady agency in the world, Faye is a little more dynamic. In fact, she's the only character who really makes us substantive and channel change by the series end, but her narrative arc also taps into the very philosophical spine of know are nihilism. Yes, I know nihilism has become wise cracks. Favorite dead horse, but hey, I didn't put it in the Zeitgeists. According to literary critic Mark Conrad Nawar Develop as a consequence of the 20th century ushering out old belief systems, when Nisha famously proclaimed God is dead, he was making a statement that these seeming like a turtle systems like God, morality or even truth, we're illusions. Reality to Nisha is in constant flux, which means things like definitions, constants, and even being don't exist over time, whether he was right or wrong, Nisha was correct in predicting the mass, alienation and loneliness brought on by the disillusionment of these systems.

Speaker 1:          17:14          As science chipped away at our happy belief systems in the 20th century, people became lost. An anxious and wise crack was born. Conrad Rights. Seeing the war as a response or reaction to the death of God helps explain the commonality of the elements that critics have noted in new our films. The inherent pessimism, alienation and disorientation. And if there's one character who's continually had belief system after belief system ripped away from her, it's Fay. When fay first awakes, she doesn't actually believe that she's in the future. That is until your lawyer's teller that she's got it all wrong. And you sent him book cause you were hunting

Speaker 6:          17:50          in this sort of [inaudible] Cintiq yes.

Speaker 1:          17:55          And if waking up in an unrecognizable future sounds bad, try adding trust issues. When Faye finds out that her old lawyer, you know the one she fell in love with had faked his death, you can bet your bottom dollar that she felt the same lonely anxiety that Nisha had described. Many of whom today [inaudible] and Faye experiences the ultimate disillusionment when she finds out that the goal she's been searching for her past is gone after Ed takes page of the place where she grew up. The two are greeted by an old classmate emphasis on old, oh not though this you Saudi, you. Hi Scooter. No Tokina dual cuna time like niches, idea of reality is in constant motion and it's left fay behind realizing that she can never get her old life back. They calls herself a ghost, but got an eye this year. [inaudible] as she later tells spike the life that she thought she wanted, the home that she wanted to return to his no more fake is not the only know our s character who's a trench coat wearing cop for a number says sweetheart. Like this. Yeah, it's everyone's favorite chef jess like faith. Just the backdrop borrows heavily from no our conventions. A former cop jet suffered two massive blows in his past. First, his lover walked out on him without warning

Speaker 6:          19:20          what you know, cleared dixter dog Solo Tokyo dogging on mogul Tita [inaudible] sooner

Speaker 1:          19:29          and second, he was nearly killed when he cornered a syndicate assassin. Oh, and did I mention jets nickname?

Speaker 7:          19:36          [inaudible] on. Oh, could I cheat. Dot. [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          19:44          so we've got a former cop turned pie. I mean bounty hunter who's pining over a loss love. Yeah, it's no arm like Fay jet has to learn. The time moves forward and with it everyone else consider the pocket. Watch the jets lover. Alyssa left him.

Speaker 4:          20:00          I [inaudible] I said it though.

Speaker 1:          20:23          Well, the symbolism might be a bit heavy handed here. Jet Holding onto the broken watch represents his desire to return to the past to a time when his watch still tit and Elisa waited for him to come home from work. But when jet seeks answers about the past, he's reminded that it's long gone. Elisa has a new life and a new boyfriend and only jet is wondering why. Worse when a lease a finally gives jet the answers he's looking for, they shatter his ideas of the past. As it turns out, jets relationship wasn't so perfect and Elisa felt trapped.

Speaker 4:          20:59          That's what he eats. And what that does, the three to tookie he's jacking. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          21:11          In the end, jet can't return to his past because this idealized past never existed at all. Looking back at that interstitial about playing without fear of risky things, breaking traditional styles and creating new genres, it's hard to argue that series director, she needs zero Watanabe didn't do just that in cowboy bebop. Saifai westerns. No, are even a little Ronan action. It's all here and it's all excellent. It's this very genre bending that's made the series so popular and it's the reason why cowboy bebop seems so fresh two decades later and there's nothing like the story that can withstand the test of time. If Cowboy Bebop, Scott, you feeling nostalgic, get excited, you can find all your old favorites plus tons of great new series on verb dragonball, super mega low box cowboy, bebop, onepiece and tons more. Personally, I'm a subs overdubs kind of Gal, but one of the best things about verb is that it gives you both and when you've had your fix of anime, there's so much more to see, like all 354 episodes of star gate or the story of another space bounty hunter crew in the new show, kill joys from [inaudible] with birth premium.
