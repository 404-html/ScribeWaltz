Speaker 1:          00:03          Pick somebody in your life and you send them a message asking them how their day is going on a scale of one to 10 and it's very important that you ask them on a scale of one to 10 for a couple of reasons, you'll actually get more interesting answer because usually, you know if somebody says a three or an eight, they'll explain it a little bit and suddenly you're getting a little more in depth information than you would normally get if you had just asked them how, how are you doing? Oh, I'm fine, or I'm tired or I'm hungry. And then when you do get a reply, what you do is you immediately texts back or write back and say, is there anything I can do to make that number plus one? Anything I could do to move you from a three to a four or from an eight to a nine.

Speaker 1:          00:51          And that shows that you are really willing to take some time and effort to do, you know, little favorites. It's a little boost for your friend. We know in looking at video games, so this is one of the reasons why video games are such effective relationship management tools, specifically social games like Farmville or candy crush saga. Lots of research has shown that when you play these games regularly with people, you become more likely to talk to them about non game topics. You do that more frequently and you're also more likely to ask them for help with a real life problem or more willing to offer them help and the reason why is the design of the Games supports more frequent interactions which are really important for building up that kind of relationship and also to show reciprocity where you are asking someone for help or you are offering help and you think about a game like farmville where you can go water some of these crops or feed their chickens for them.

Speaker 1:          01:52          Or Candy Crush Saga where I'm constantly asking my inlaws to send me extra lives and I'm sending them little power booths in the game. That little act of reciprocity, I'm willing to help you. You're willing to help me and doing it regularly. You know, everyday or a couple times a week that firmly cements in somebody's mind the idea of you as an ally and you might have people that you want to have thinking of you that way, that aren't playing any of these video games. So the plus one technique is a way to make sure that you're talking regularly about these everyday topics, but also that you have a chance to give a little bit of support or help just, you know, what, how can I move you just plus one on this scale, something small that I can do today and it's something that I do quite often that not only does it help, you know, make someone else's Day, but I kind of enjoyed it when I get the chance to hear how people are doing and just do that one little thing to make their day better. Parents love it. Parents will love it. When you do that, that's like, that's like the most prime audience for this. They will write you back a paragraph on why it's an eight day and then, and then you offered you plus one and their dislike. It's already plentiful on because you wrote.
