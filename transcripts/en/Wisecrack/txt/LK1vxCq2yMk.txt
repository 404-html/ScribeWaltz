Speaker 1:          00:02          A wise crack, jared here today, we're diving deep into the world of metal gear solid now because doing a full scale philosophy of would be an arsenal gear scale undertaking. We decided to focus on something else today, the enigmatic nature of its Creator Studio Jima. Not only will we be talking about the underlying themes of the games, but also how Kajima has inserted himself into these games in an unprecedented way. Nowadays. It's not uncommon to have a small indie game tell a personal story from its creator, but it is uncommon to see that happen with a big budget cinematic thriller like metal gear solid. These games aren't just a collection of stories about solid snake in big boss. They're also about co Gima and his place in video gaming at the time. In a funny way, life imitates art. Here you have a narrative arc going from upbeat poppy spy adventures to Nihilistic, Anti American cynicism as coaching his relationship with Konami Sour, but now with those shackles fried, he's off to make whatever weird thing this is, but before Koji, Miss Games became gut punching, self critical studies.

Speaker 1:          01:06          They started off as a Kurt Russell, rip off welcome to this wise crack edition on co Gima and metal gear solid, but before we get into it, we wanted to give a shout out to our sponsor, audible, who enabled us to finally dive into the crazy world of metal gear. We're going to get into this in a hot second, but Winco Jima created the world with metal gear solid. It was actually inspired by Richard Dawkins, the selfish gene. I call him Dickie Dee because we're tight. You can learn about the very ideas that inspired him to Yoko Gina's work while still playing his games, but I'll get more into that later to listen to the selfish gene yourself had to audible.com/wise crack or just text wise, crack to 500, $500 and check it out and get yourself a free 30 day trial.

That's audible.com/wise, crack or pull out your phone and text wise, crack to 500, 500. Thanks to audible. Oh, and watch out. Major spoilers ahead. The seventies were a decade when visionary American directors were making masterpiece after masterpiece with directors getting top billing, discreet, artistically mature works. A whole generation of kids grew up wanting to make their mark on the world through movies and video. Kojima was right there among them, but as fate would have it, gaming would be the outlet for Cucina to express his cinematic ambitions. The first two metal gear games are full of references to coaching was favorite action movies. The whole concept of self gameplay was inspired by these sneaking scenes of the great escape. One of the bosses, a duo of unstoppable cyborgs.

Speaker 1:          02:39          We're straight up terminators originally called Arnold's and snakes. Codename was ripped directly from Russell's character in escape from New York. I'm not a snake who gene was earlier works. Police knots and snatcher were respectively animate up Japanese takes on lethal weapon and blade runner, but it was the advent of three d gaming in the late nineties that gave Kajima a truly cinematic canvas to work with. Suddenly, video games needed cinematography and performances, so Kajima made snake even more of a Kurt Russell rip off. My name is Pliska. The solid snake of metal gear solid was so close to snake skin that years later the film's rights holders actually wanted to sue until John Carpenter stopped them, but beyond his obvious love for movies, you can also see a kind of optimism and metal gear solid what I understand, but why metal gear, the nuclear age ended with the turn of the millennium writing a spy adventure in the late nineties, shortly after the Cold War has snake saying things like this.

Speaker 2:          03:37          Russia today has enough. They're struggling between freedom and order, and with that struggle, a new spirit of nationalism is born

Speaker 1:          03:45          given the enormous economic decline Russia faced after the Cold War. Snakes, words might sound naive today, but they fit right into an upbeat feeling of peace and prosperity for the West. Complete with a villain, frustrated over a world, gone soft off, throwing the launch this weapon and get a billion dollars. We'll be able to bring chaos and back to this world soft. This is metal gear solid at its most optimistic, but it's all downhill from here. In December of 1999, the Ria filed a lawsuit against napster. Cocina thought the idea of the US government controlling how people shared music was great fodder for his paranoid cyberpunk spy fiction, so in metal gear solid to our villains are the patriots, a secret network of conspirators who have a chokehold on the US government, the media and the minds of the people.

Speaker 3:          04:35          This country is shaped and controlled as the Patriot seat fit. The people are shown what they want to believe, what you call it. Government is actually a weld stage production aimed at satisfying the public,

Speaker 1:          04:45          which includes you, the player

Speaker 4:          04:48          colonel. I just remembered something that I've never met you in person, not once.

Speaker 1:          04:54          If you fell for all the bait and switch tricks packed into games writing now, yes, in the sql games, it's revealed that the patriots are actually robot ai satellites made for comic relief sidekicks from the Prequel Games, but importantly they're based on something much more real. We are formless. We are very disciplined and morality that Americans invoke so often. The Patriots are the concept of memes personified.

Speaker 3:          05:18          We started with genetic engineering and in the end we succeeded in digitizing life itself, but there are

Speaker 1:          05:25          are things not covered by genetic information. What do you mean? Human Memories ID culture, history, metal gear, solid one references Richard Dawkins' book, the selfish gene in which he coined the term the beams means our cultural ideas that replicate and spread from people to people similar to gene's tunes, catchphrases and ideas are all means also means or means, so as the language you're thinking in right now, which means the perspective that you understand reality, which is all made out of meat. The are these psychological homogenization of culture. They aren't globalization, they or why other countries are wearing America's blue jeans and listening to their poppies, Perko Jima. They are yet Japanese game developer can succeed at making very Japanese games for Americans based on American action movies. All the movie references that Cocina included in these games are memes as the games themselves, the end of metal gear solid to has all the characters reflecting on the meaning of life and it's said to reflect co Gina's anxieties about his own work as well.

Speaker 5:          06:29          Life isn't just about passing on your genes. We can leave behind much more than just DNA through speech and music, literature and movies. What we've seen heard, felt anger, joy and sorrow. These are the things I will pass on.

Speaker 1:          06:53          Countless interviews at the time revealed that metal gear, solid tube was supposed to be coaching was last metal gear games before handing it off to a new team. In a sense go Jima was trying to pass on his mean,

Speaker 5:          07:04          yeah, well listen, what I do, I'm going to quit,

Speaker 1:          07:15          but was so unsatisfied with what they were cooking up for. Mail gear solid three that he decided to step back in and directed himself. So in true [inaudible] fashion metal gear solid three is full of even more Kajima means the game takes place on [inaudible] first birthday, August 24th, 19, 64, and includes multiple movie references, especially early sixties. James Bond and hitchcock flicks. Go was personal. Philosophies are once again present, but this time there's a decidedly more nihilistic slant from a character called the boss. Light is, but a farewell gift from the darkness to those on their way to die. The bosses message of breaking down the world's political barriers

Speaker 5:          07:53          is there such a thing as an absolute timeless anymore. There is no such thing and never has been, and the reason is that our enemies are human beings like us. There can only be our enemies in relative terms. The world must be made whole

Speaker 1:          08:14          is gradually warped and perverted until it turns our hero into a villain. The big boss of the earlier two d games who was warmongering for the sake of giving mercenaries, a purpose in life. It's a bleak view of the world that comes to fruition in metal gear. Solid four ever respect that face in your mirror. The first world becomes obsessed with war and the third world is their battlefield. In the Games universe, wars had become cold financial strategies in real life, so had metal gear, solid games under Konami. This was the second time code. Jima was roped into continuing metal gear solid after wanting to back out with attempts at franchises like zone of the vendors and Bach tie failing to capture mainstream attention the same way. So metal gear solid four was explicitly designed to end it all for real. This time, the gameplay acquiesced to the first person shooter modes and fully controllable cameras demanded by reviewers and the story gave in to the fans most burning questions while the cutscenes fulfilled comas, lifelong desire to make films, no other metal gear, maybe even no other game has cut scenes that go on as long as the and the grand irony of it all is that this is both be closest and furthest.

Speaker 1:          09:23          Kajima came to making actual movies. Metal gear, solid four had plenty of live action video put Kajima, didn't direct write or produce it. These intro commercials were outsourced to an American studio. Meanwhile, questions from metal gear, solid food that were never meant to be answered are answered to the Wilderness and results

Speaker 5:          09:40          on site. Destroy Katie with a nuclear strike. The Patriots network will be mine and then I'll build my haven.

Speaker 1:          09:50          A melodramatic costume party. Story ends with the hero and villain beating the dead horse of their conflict for 20 minutes and solid snake is now old snake. There's definitely an undercurrent of self hatred running through this game, especially with the knowledge that Koji human wanted to run away from its development and originally planned in ending where were arrested and executed, which came from the fact that fans sent him death threats if it wasn't made, but despite could was protests and metal gear solid four is conclusive narrative. He still couldn't get out. Konami was demanding more and more of these games and they were to be made by no one else. A rocky relationship between Kajima and his employer started boiling up in 2009 with him joking in an interview that if fans Richard Right the CEO of Konami and tell him that [inaudible] doesn't have to make metal gear anymore, it might be easier for him to stop. Go. Jean was only nonmetal gear project after four was a minor production role in Castlevania lords of shadow, but then it was right back to snake and now metal. Here's plot had to become more convoluted and provocative to keep up with its own standard.

Speaker 5:          10:52          Obviously they're bringing in state of the art, weaponry and equipment by the shipload. Where'd they get that kind of cash? I fear maybe involved the CIA.

Speaker 1:          11:07          Peace walkers fiction tested the idea of nuclear deterrence. Wait, he's launching a new. To prove that is perfect. Current works. His words to prove that if someone attacks us, we will strike back a situation that mirrored the mutually assured destruction of coaching was creative work against Konami's tight control of it. This t rated portable entry still had to explore the gritty. He'll turn of big boss and the route code human took was her boss to idolize Che Guevara.

Speaker 6:          11:36          Jay never managed to numb himself pain. That's why people loved him and why he died.

Speaker 1:          11:43          A figure whose popularity to his western audience is polarizing to say the least. Four years later, the Anti American sentiments of the series new protagonists are taken the extreme ground zeroes to explain to him a very thinly veiled Guantanamo Bay were supporting characters are subjected to horrific sexual humiliation and torture. A year after that, metal gear solid five, the phantom pain pain's the US intelligence community as an out of control evil conducting experiments on third world refugees while also rubbing the u. s is known as hard in their real life support the Afghan Mujahideen.

Speaker 7:          12:17          Four years ago, the Soviets invaded Afghanistan. Muslims are fighting back with Western support

Speaker 1:          12:24          and desire president mobile. Second set go.

Speaker 7:          12:27          You're not selling them US military hardware.

Speaker 1:          12:33          Would you ever read about Napster in ninth, 99 to make the Patriots and it's just as likely that news breaking out about Apu Grip Guantanamo and Edward Snowden inspired this new version of an American illuminati cipher. These stories were being told in spite of and perhaps in response to coach edema, not exactly having a great working relationship with neo liberal corporate capitalism. When rumors of a rivalry between Cocina and Konami came to light, so did stories of his bosses actively sabotaging his projects. Eventually shipping metal gear solid five in two parts with an incomplete ending, believe it or not, the first edition of Moby Dick, a novel frequently referenced, and metal gear solid five was also released without it's ending chapter. The parallels between moby Dick and metal gear solid five are rampant venom code named Ahab is an amputee naval captain hell bent on revenge. Who commands a vessel called the peak was just like the Aa happened in the book,

Speaker 7:          13:35          but

Speaker 1:          13:35          this connection to the male of the classic is also reflected by the players' response to the game. Like Ahab the player is relentlessly chasing after a white whale. They'll never best a feeling of completeness at the end of finishing this game. It's a feeling so pervasive that entire fan communities have sprung up over refusing to believe that the game is over. Similarly, in Melville's book, the eponymous white whale is seen as a representation of being a hollowness of the universe, the thought of annihilation or the meaningless prize of a life spent seeking meaning in metal gear. Solid five players can seek meaning by completing a story arc that ends halfway through with the second half of the story asking, but never answering the question of what happens after a hero defeats the villain. Players can instead seek meaning in the Games multiplayer missions which developed a kind of whaling economy of their own or they can find meaning by going for a completion score.

Speaker 1:          14:28          That of course has them fruitlessly chasing after rare animals, but no matter how you play, no matter which ending you go for the Games, tone remains melancholy, lonely, and a anti climactic. There's no epic final boss fight. Each ending is intended to leave the player feeling unfulfilled and wanting the player feels a literal phantom pain which leads us in our own opinion, at least to believe that could Jima was his own, Captain Ahab with his own obsession to defy the typically cold corporate tradition of game design and create his own art on his own terms if he's been wanting to get crazy and make something different than at least his story can have a happy ending for now because Norman reedus waking up naked on the beach after giving birth to a magic goes baby is a premise of a story where we truly don't know what to expect and also something that could have never been done under the thumb of Konami.

Speaker 1:          15:21          So is this life imitating art or were these just insightful predictions bound to come true? Either way, color us stoke to checkout. Death stranding. Kajima is truly one of those interesting. Ah, tours in gaming. And as always, thanks for watching guys. Piece. Thanks for watching. Wise crack in case you missed it.
