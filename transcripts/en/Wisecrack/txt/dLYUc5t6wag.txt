Speaker 1:          00:11          Hey, wise crack jared here and I promise I'm not here to beat a dead Tauntaun. As I'm sure everyone knows the last jet I pissed off a lot of fans and wise crack. We've surfaced the usual rants. Luke skywalker is suddenly a green milk chugging coward. Snow gets darth Maul before we know anything about him. Holos plan doesn't make any sense. The Canto bight section is boring. Raised parents were red herring, marvel humor for days. This is hops and of course lay hoppins but we're not going to spend 15 minutes fanboy rages. Instead we're going to discuss how Ryan Johnson tried to revolutionize star wars but did so what went wrong? Well, to answer that and we'll need a little help from a guy who in a roundabout way is responsible for making star wars star wars. Nope, not that guy. This guy welcome this crack condition on the last Jedi.

Speaker 1:          01:04          What went wrong and spoiler alert, even though I already spoiled pretty much everything now, before we jump in, if you will allow me to get a little Meta on you. The relationship between Kylo Ren and Darth vader can be interpreted as a commentary on the relationship new star wars has with the original star wars that you will never be as strong as Darth Beta in the force awakens. Kylo ren is burdened by the task of living up to the legend of his grandfather. Just as the new series has the seemingly impossible pressure of living up to the legacy of the original trilogy. Just as Kylo ren mimics darth vader by dressing like him and using a voice modulator, even though there's nothing wrong with his voice.

Speaker 1:          01:46          So too does the force awakens mimic a new hope? As many critics have noticed, it's almost beat per beat. The same movie. This may seem like a stretch, but the dynamic between smoke and Kylo in the opening of the last Jed, I furthers this meter reading as snuck, tells Kylo to take off the stupid masked and that he shouldn't even bother anymore. Y'All know, just a child and then ren breaks the mask a might as well go and throw Luke's light saber off a cliff. Oh wait. Johnson is telegraphing to his audience that this will no longer be a rehash of the original trilogy. The film will be a radical subversion of the star wars formula for the new star wars to live the old star wars must die,

Speaker 2:          02:34          but the time if you have to

Speaker 1:          02:38          with the last Jedi, Brian Johnson isn't interested in recycling old star wars. He's interested in progress, not only progressing the franchise itself, but the landscape of a certain galaxy far, far away. In order to progress the franchise, Johnson abrasively undermines the troops and traditions that characterize the previous fields. Whereas Luke Skywalker, the son of noble blood raise parents are just degenerate. Why knows nobody filthy junk traders. So do you offer drinking money? Our heroes are now janitors and mechanics instead of politicians and princesses. Luke is no longer the idealistic hero. He's a failed nephew, murderer slash Slovenian philosopher, Yoda. It goes from symbol of Jedi. Heidi two would be booked burner and the jet I order kind of sucks.

Speaker 2:          03:26          Lesson two, now that they're extinct, the jet I or romanticize deified. If you strip away the myth and look at their deeds legacy, if the Jeddah is failure, hypocrisy, Hubris, that's not true. At the height of their powers, they allow.city has to rise, create the empire and wipe them out. It was a Jedi master who was responsible for the training,

Speaker 1:          03:50          ub Darth vader. So you might be asking why on everything that defined the previous films. Well, because turns out the events of the previous films didn't really lead to any progress. After the collapse of the empire, a nearly identical Nazi inspired fascistic order has risen. So clearly something is wrong in the galaxy if this keeps happening. So what's to blame for this reemergence of evil? Well, Johnson seems to suggest it's are inadequate conception of good and evil. But wait, start divisions between good and evil are what the entire star wars mythology has been built around. It's the dark side, not the dark nuance.

Speaker 1:          04:27          And here's where the movie almost gets really smart. As many of you may know, George Lucas crafted the original trilogy point for point around a book called the hero with a thousand faces written by Joseph Campbell. The book sets forth a kind of universal story structure from which myth stories and literature all borrow, which is why the structure is called the monomyth, but instead of simply recycling Campbell's monomyth as seen in the original trilogy, Johnson uses it to complicate our relationship with a dark side. You see, Campbell's monomyth is based on the work of psychoanalysts. Carl, you wrote about ideas like the collective unconscious and archetypes, universal primordial images ingrained deep in our psyche. Those archetypes for Campbell informed the kind of characters that keep popping up in stories across continents and cultures. So let's talk about one of those archetypes, the shadow and how the last, Jed, I tries to radically redefine our relationship to it.

Speaker 1:          05:21          For you and the shadow is the primal or animal part of our unconscious that tends to get repressed. The dark side. See where we're going with this. In the monomyth, this dark side usually gets embodied by a character who represents the shortcomings, fears, and anxieties of our protagonist. Gollum is frodos shadow a stark reminder of what he could become. But if you really want shadows, one o one look no further than darth vader and Luke Skywalker. Darth vader was once a powerful Jedi who succumbed to the dark side for Luke. Darth vader serves as a constant reminder of what he could become if it does not conquer his fear. And Master has passions. So confronting darth vader is more than just a physical confrontation. It's an emotional and psychological one. It's why Luke spares darth vader's life. If he were to strike him down in anger, then he's lost the battle with his inner demons. But we're as the old star wars wants you to conquer your inner demons. The new star wars has other ideas in all the films were meant to believe. That balance in the force is desirable for the good of the galaxy. You refer to the prophecy of the one who will bring balance to the force. You believe it's this boy. However, the last Jedi suggests that the forces, something that inherently promotes balance. When the darkness rises, the force amplifies the light to balance it out. Darkness rises to meet.

Speaker 1:          06:46          I warned my young apprentice that as he grew stronger is equally in the light would rise if we're to believe snuck here. Wouldn't that mean that the inverse is true than any powerful Jedi order would be met with an equally powerful dark side? If so, we have no choice but to read Luke's criticism of the Jedi order as one that blames them in part for the cyclical rise and fall of these fascist empires. While it's kind of ambiguous, this logical conclusion seems to be hinted at by Luke.

Speaker 3:          07:16          Yes. The lesson that fourth not bombed the jet. I to say that at the jet I died a light diocese bannock feel that

Speaker 1:          07:27          with episode eight the dark side is no longer something to be conquered by the valeant jetta. I at the behest of the light side, because that will make the force over correct to achieve balance leading to more amplifications of evil. According to union analyst Robert H. Johnson. Not to be confused with Ryan Johnson, we shouldn't think of our dark sides as something to merely conquer and expunge. Johnson says this, active repression causes us to accumulate the darkness, which creates an ego split according to his reading of Ume. When you suppress the darkness, you're forced to find a scape goat project, all your own ugliness onto them leading to a never ending fight. This is quite literally done in the very way the original star wars is written with Luke's inner demons projected onto an evil space wizard. Instead of maintaining this classic distinction between good and bad, both within our characters and in the general plot, Ryan Johnson tries to complicate it at every step of the way. As we see, conquering evil with good hasn't done much for the galaxy. The empire is basically back with a sexy new rebranding and snuck is basically palpatine 2.0 in earlier star wars deek. Good bad distinction is literally black and white, and thus the force awakens brings us right back to where we started. So to progress the franchise. Ryan Johnson tweaks the basic youngest formula. If you suggested that we must reconcile our dark side with the rest of our personality. Does the galaxy need to reconcile it's dark side with the larger order of things?

Speaker 2:          08:57          Oh, US

Speaker 1:          09:02          consider Benicio del Toro's character Dj. Rather than upholding the traditional distinction between purely good rebels and purely evil oppressors, he explores how even the good guys can get caught up in the darker elements of the universe as the galaxies very own blackwater mercenary, the cynical Dj sees through the false divisions of good and evil. At least you're stealing from them

Speaker 2:          09:23          bad guys and helping the good, good guys. Bad guys made up words. Let's see who formally owned his own an arms dealer made his bag selling weapons to the back. Guys

Speaker 1:          09:48          under good. This marks the most morally ambiguous moments in any star wars film when he not only suggest that divisions between good and evil are insincere and unhelpful, but complicates our understanding of the rebellion as an infallible good. Robert Johnson sees our traditional understanding of the light and dark sides as straight up dangerous. He says that our inability to reconcile with our shadow and therefore our eventual scapegoating on to others will inevitably end in violence, war and racism for the last Jed, I rather than the good guys and bad guys, there's a system at play his own machine partner,

Speaker 1:          10:26          live free, don't join. It becomes the first star wars film to explicitly critique the galaxies, military economy and the exploitation and animal rights violations inherent in it, which even heroes like Princess Leia are party to then shelled us to test their weapons. So you might be asking at this point, aside from being too ballsy, what one wrong? Well, the movie goes out of its way to in both form and content, tell us that we must kill the past, whether it be the past structure of star wars films or the moral lens we understood the previous films through, then this happens. It's time to little things. Die,

Speaker 2:          11:06          smoke Skywalker, Jed, I the rebels, let it all die, right? I want you to join me.

Speaker 1:          11:21          Ray is given a chance to end all the dogmatism of the previous films and yet she says No. And from this point on, it's all back peddle central. Nope. No, you're still holding on. All the things that we were convinced need to be killed are reaffirmed, tearing down the heroic archetypes inherent in the mono myth. Shampoo's burning advantaged with a handful of my students slaughtered the rest. Layered blimps smoke. But

Speaker 2:          11:54          it was me. I fail cause I was Luke Skywalker chat. High master

Speaker 1:          12:12          a legend. Nope. The legend of Luke Skywalker lives on inspiring the galaxy once again and this time as an added bonus. It's a lie. Gay Necessity to tear down established orders that delineate the division between good and evil.

Speaker 2:          12:27          It's time for the Jedi to end. Nope, not be the last gen I

Speaker 1:          12:34          desire to distance itself from the established narrative structure of the original trilogy. Nope.

Speaker 2:          12:39          Strike me down in anger and I'll always be with you. It was striking to me. Dot. I will become all powerful than one possibly imagined.

Speaker 1:          12:47          Get the jet I pass. Nope. Save the books. It's not that movies can't insert ideas and then ultimately reject them. But usually the ideological shift happens as the plot pushes our heroes to reconsider their ideas. In interesting and thought provoking ways. Instead Luke decides to reaffirm all the antiquated ideas because he loves his sister. I guess other reversals are equally perplexing. Don't be a hero.

Speaker 2:          13:12          She was protecting the light. Then she will see me like

Speaker 1:          13:19          until it's okay to be a hero and by this point the film has made a psychologically sophisticated case for why ray should team up with Ren. The old way doesn't work. Jed Eyes are repressed as hell and we're stuck playing a galactic game of Nazi whac-a-mole fine. We need a radical change, which is literally what Ren seems to be offering despite her faith in Rennes essential goodness and despite Luke's lesson that the forces beyond good and evil ray hesitates. Here's where ray and ren become opposing stand ins for the films to potential moral codes. Ran is the realist who knows that the rebels will try to impose the same moral expectations on to ray as they did to luke having become well acquainted with his bad side and his good and wisely calling out the folly of the false division. Ren is arguably closer to finding that youngian balance than most.

Speaker 1:          14:11          He seems to be offering to ray exactly what Robert Johnson and can say a person should strive for recognition that the ego and shadow are both part of a person. And what's more that one literally cannot exist without the other. Meanwhile, ray represents the old moral code of Star Wars. The temptation to run away with her swole new crush is ultimately overcome by her desire to be the good jetta I a morally pure infallible hero who definitely isn't suppressing a lifetime supply of darkness. No surgery. So if you're going to revolutionize star wars, great. Want to reframe how we think about the central conflict? Cool. But spending this time abrasively subverting everything we love and know about star wars. Just do shrug and revert back to where we started. Nah, less cool. But what do you think wise crack is this latest iteration of star wars sacrilegious or a much needed fresh take on the series.

Speaker 1:          15:06          Let us know what you think in the comments and as always, thanks for watching peace. Now, while the last jet I had its problems. So to does my life. Recently, my social media account was hacked by a troll and actual living under a bridge troll. He held my twitter captive unless I could answer this. Brain teaser from brilliant.org supposed to people standing in place are holding a rope firmly so it doesn't slip through their hands. Which of the two people can apply a greater force on the rope? The person was stronger muscles, the person with greater mass, or will they both apply equal force? I was clueless until I checked out brilliant.org website that makes learning math, science, and logic fuel like an arcade game. Personally, I love their physics of everyday module, which helped me get the riddle right and now I have my twitter back.
