Speaker 1:          00:00          Sometimes people think that emotion, uh, and art are sort of side shows, the human intelligence, the real essence of intelligence. It's thinking logically if that were true computers already smarter than we are and because so much better at logical thinking that we are. Uh, it's actually things like being funny, being sexy or expressing a loving sentiment maybe in a poem or an a musical piece. That's the cutting edge of human intelligence has to do with the hierarchy of the NEOCORTEX and at the low levels, uh, things may seem cold and mechanical cause where our neocortex can recognize very simple objects and make very simple decisions at a high level. It's dealing with concepts like the beauty of a poem by Emily Dickinson or the, or the ability to create a poem like that. And we can come back to creativity. I believe it's an exercise in, in metaphors.

Speaker 1:          00:58          And the NEOCORTEX is a metaphor machine. That's what it's good at. That's why humans are creative. But we have this very large hierarchy where we have more and more abstract and complex patterns. You know, Bill's on patterns below it. And the difference between humans and say other primates is, so we have more of the Neocortex, we have this big forehead, we could fit it in the frontal cortex and therefore have a higher number of hierarchies of levels of the hierarchy. And that was the enabling factor that that permitted the evolution of language and technology and art and science. We're going to create synthetic neocortex is based on the same principles. I'm actually working on that. Uh, and we've had hierarchical systems like that. I helped pioneer a concept called hierarchical hidden Markov models similar to what happens in the brain, but we only had a few levels.

Speaker 1:          01:58          The brain has a very large number of levels and all the way from recognizing edges of objects up to, you know, she's beautiful or creating a beautiful painting or work of music or scientific insight. Um, we will create artificial neocortex, it said, have a comparable number or a greater number. And, and I think the principal application will actually be to extend our own neocortex. We have 300 million pattern recognizers in the neocortex by my estimate. That hierarchy we build ourselves. Each of these pattern recognizers capable of connecting itself to other neocortex is to build this hierarchy. We build that hierarchy from the moment we're born or before that, uh, we're constantly building it, but we run up against this limitation of 300 million. We'll be able to extend that and thinking the cloud, you know, if you do anything interesting with this, do a search or language or, uh, bring up a map or ask it a question.

Speaker 1:          03:02          It doesn't take place in the box. It goes out to the cloud. We're going to put these just really w, uh, gateways a gateway to the cloud. We're going to put gateways to the cloud in our brains and have more than 300 million. Uh, just like the cloud can give you a thousand or a million computers for a 10th of a second, you need another billion pattern. Recognizers uh, uh, you'll be able to access that in the cloud. That's where we're headed. And it will be more intelligent, uh, enabled to actually think in a greater number of hierarchies. If you think that realized that the quantitative improvement from primates to humans with a big forehead to allow larger Neocortex, uh, was the enabling factor for language art and music and science. Uh, what kind of qualitative leap can we make with another quantitative increase? And that's, that's I think where we're headed.

Speaker 2:          04:04          Okay.
