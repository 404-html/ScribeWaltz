Speaker 1:          00:08          Hey, wise crack jared here. As you grow older, you come to learn some hard truths. Santa isn't real. Serial makes you fat. Space Jam is a bad movie. It's a natural and inevitable course, but that's why I'm here to bury your childhood completely. That's right. Your childhoods last happy gasps of excitement will be drowned out by the plump, plump up dirt, slowly encasing it. So get ready to become a hardened alcoholic with three mortgages and an angry ex wife because I'm here to tell you that the lion king is actually cinemas. Cutest advocacy of totalitarian ethics. Welcome this wise crack condition on the lion king and as always spoilers ahead but seriously wasn't seen as the movie. While the lion king is one of the most beloved films of the Disney Cannon, the Animal Kingdoms political landscape also happens to be eerily similar to some of the worst ideologies of not only the 20th century, but arguably of all time.

Speaker 1:          01:03          The Lion King tells the story of Simba a young lion or Dane to succeed his father move Fossa as king of the pride lands. Mufasa teaches his young son all about proper rulership and the delicate balance of nature that a king must uphold. However, Mufasa as brothers scar covets the throne gets moved, Fossa killed and convinces the young Simba that it's all his fault before claiming the throne for himself. Some lives out his shame with some carefree hippies before returning to the pride land to reclaim his rightful throne. Also, it's based on hamlet. If the lion king, we're just the story of a king, his prints and a jealous brother. There wouldn't be much to say, but it isn't just that. In fact, the film posits two principles which have been justifying the world's worst, desperate since before despots even existed. The first is seemingly the most wholesome at the beautiful balance of nature is the basis for politics or as the film memorably calls it. The film's famous opening number displays the majestic nature of the African Savanna and the glorious natural order of things we Fossa establishes that pride rock is run on basic natural tenants. Everything the light touches is all

Speaker 1:          02:19          a king's time. As ruler rises and falls like the sun hell, the sky opens up and shines a halo over move fosters newborn son. The heavens literally marking the lions as the rightful natural rulers. The imagery couldn't be any clearer if they tacked on a Kyron stating obey, move Fossa. And while you may wonder what it means for a society that is ruled by someone like a lion who eats his subjects, don't worry. The circle of life is beautiful.

Speaker 2:          02:46          Yes, but let me explain. When we die, our bodies become the grass and the antelope eat the grass. And so we owe connected in the great circle of life,

Speaker 1:          03:00          even though to be more scientifically accurate, it's more likely that for the antelope, at least they're fully digested. Brothers and sisters will be excreted by the likes of Simba to fertilize the grass, which they'll eat. So it's like cannibalism with extra steps. And while it seems like a message that even an environmentalist could get on board with, this is where it gets dark. All the monkeys, elephants and giraffes seem to happily accept their place in society, hailing the birth of a creature that may very well eat them one day even move is faithful servant quickly gets over the fact that he's assaulted and humiliated as prey because well, he is praying, but not everyone is happy with their lot in life. The hyenas are at the bottom of the food chain, presumably because they're scavengers. You're looking at you guys, and when we're dangling at the bottom of the food chain, it's clear that hyenas aren't welcome in pride rock.

Speaker 1:          03:49          So they'd been relegated to starve in an elephant graveyard. So that's principle one, that there is a natural order to things that must be adhered to. Those who are at the bottom of the food chain must accept their place for the greater good. This whole vision of rulership as maintaining harmony is not new. It was advocated by Plato, but according to philosopher Karl Popper, also known as k pop, it's pretty much responsible for everything. Terrible. That's happened in western history sense. Popper calls this general framework, whole Islam, the idea that the whole of a society is more important than the individual and what's good for society is usually defined by some in controvertible law, whether it be natural order, racial purity, or the laws of history. Popper explains that for Plato to keep one's place is a virtue and popper goes on to explain that in this view of the world and individual's goal is to be a perfectly crafted cog in the great clockwork of societal.

Speaker 1:          04:44          Different cogs will have different roles, but the virtue of keeping one's place will be common to all of them and it will the same time be the virtue of the hole. That of being properly fitted together, of being in harmony to this universal principle, Plato gives the name, justice, justice, justice, justice, justice, justice, justice. This theory of justice popper argues is totalitarian morality. In a nutshell if the individual is simply a cog than ethics is nothing but how to make them fit there and to get all historical popper pointed out that Plato, a dennison of Athens seem to have a boner for Sparta, which when you think about it is a cruel eugenics driven military dictatorship and for popper, Plato's politics have been ruining the world ever since. Inspiring everyone from petty tyrants to big, bad totalitarian nightmares to break this harmony for plato would be chaos or more specifically democracy. No, seriously, Plato's whole view of democracy was that it gives the right to rule to those who have no business in doing so, the poor, the landless and the stupid sound like anyone we'll call this scary principle 1.5 because it fits into the larger holism piece. Democracy for Plato is a sort of catch 22 where sure all the people are equal and free to do whatever they like, but because most people are self interested, dicks society will quickly collapse as everyone pursues their own shortsighted goals.

Speaker 3:          06:09          There's no food, no water, it's dinner time or we ain't got no stinking entrees.

Speaker 1:          06:14          In a democracy. The lower class grows bigger and more emboldened. They break the law with impunity, run naked in the streets and then form their own youtube channels or whatever the equivalent was back then. Now listen, I'm not here to say that we should all collectively worship at the altar of democracy and freak out whenever there's a well reasoned criticism of it. It's certainly not an infallible system.

Speaker 3:          06:34          I like him. He looks me in the eye.

Speaker 2:          06:38          I'm like

Speaker 1:          06:39          beer with him. I'm voting for him, but well, there's a difference between reasonable criticism and pro authoritarian propaganda. Scar in the hyenas aren't exactly out for democracy, but they are out for equal footing.

Speaker 2:          06:51          A new way in which lie on and Hyena come together in our grapes,

Speaker 1:          07:00          been relegated to the pride lands equivalent of New Jersey where they're doomed to star. They're being manipulated by scar. Who wants to be king for his own ends? And this mirrors the way as Plato predicts democracy and never bubbly ends in tyranny with demagogues making false promises to the poor and hungry.

Speaker 2:          07:17          Hi, why don't make hay strict quit on me.

Speaker 1:          07:26          Scar fully embodies plato's quintessential tyrant per play. Doh eight hybrids is the worst type of man, a man so consumed by his own lawless desires that he will do anything to achieve them even murder.

Speaker 2:          07:38          No. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          07:44          When you have tyrants who have not achieved internal harmony, they go d harmonizing everything around them. When scar takes control of pride rock for some inexplicable reason, the rivers run dry and the bright lush pride lands are reduced. Weight bearing gray wasteland and scar is supposed to be the smart one and he's absolutely right. If the pride lands are suffering, it's because scar has usurped the natural order of things. And if you dare question your natural lot in life, well you must be a villain. It's an argument that would be well received in the halls of any monarchy or a dictatorship. And to bring abundance back to his homeland symbols, ghost ad reminds him to restore the natural or

Speaker 2:          08:24          takes your place in the circle of the rice

Speaker 1:          08:26          and like magic. Once Simba sends the usurper scar to his death, rejuvenating rains fall on the pride lands bringing abundance and prosperity. Once again.

Speaker 2:          08:41          The second

Speaker 1:          08:41          more creepy principle. The film is spouses. Is One less associated with Plato and more? Well, every sociopath ever might makes right. This dismal view of society holds that all morality isn't governed reason or the exchange of ideas, but brute force and weirdly the film just seems to go right out there and admit it as hot as brains go. I got the lion's share, but when it comes to blue to strengths, I'm afraid I'm at the shallow end of the gene who scars. Intelligence is connected to his deceitful illness, whereas his brother strength is connected to his nobleness. This view is a favorite of not only Nazi Germany but pretty much any country trying to invade this out if their weaker neighbors. So what do you guys think?
