Hey, wise crack. Not a pickle. Jared here and today we're breaking down the season finale of rick and morty. Season three in this season, especially rick and Morty, continues to flump the meaninglessness of our existence. Nobody gets it. Nothing you think matters matters. This is special. This, this is happening infinite times across infinite realities. Every time the show's teased us with an authentic moment of love or motion, it's ripped it right out from Andress. My grandpa was my hero. Your mom wouldn't have accepted me if I came home without you and your sister. So now you know the real reason I rescued you. I just took over the family. Morning. This leaves an interesting challenge for creating a TV show.

Speaker 1:          00:47          How do you have characters grow when there is no meaning? Well, let's show it gives us a novel solution that's a little better than just spiraling deeper into nihilism guarantee. You're going to die if you touch me and there's no afterlife. Everything just goes black, don't do it, and that growth isn't from the titular protagonist, but the matriarch of the Smith family wasn't list wisecrack quick take on the rick and morty and of course spoilers ahead. Okay, so first a quick recap. Rick and morty are called in to help the president with some x files, shenanigans, but soon for of helping out the leader of the free world. Rick and the president began an ever escalating Dick waving contest, the to unleash their vast arsenals against each other before rick has a more pressing matter to attend to Jerry out. The more interesting subplot, however, is best fresh off the events of episode nine.

Speaker 1:          01:34          Beth begins to question whether or not she had taken rick's offer to be replaced by a clone and if she in fact is the clone to settle the matter. She seeks the help of Jerry who recreates one of their first dates and rekindles their love, but still worried she's gone. Blade runner, Beth, runs off to the woods with the family or rick shows up to kill Jerry and convince her that she's not a clone. And our last quick take, we talked about rick informing Beth of what her intelligence actually means, my evil worse. You're smart when you know nothing matters. The Universe is yours and I've never met a universe that was into it. Rick's answer to all this, of course, as we know, is don't think about it. Faced with this, Beth has given radical freedom to choose her destiny. In this freedom brings her solace about her choice to stay with or leave her family, regardless of which choice she makes.

Speaker 1:          02:22          I don't know if I can do it. Then stay and luxuriate in a life you can finally know you've chosen my secret bonuses, that no matter what you choose, you're finally going to chill the Scout. But this episode seems to suggest that she chose to stay. Matthew crazy bitch. You're my daughter. And as a new found sense of happiness, she's being a better mother to summer sort of. I just put it on for finding now. I can't buy it. Oh, come on. You look great. You're only young ones. Just promise if the results are too strong, you'll use protection. Finally loves Jerry and has brought her family back together. Real family. Now, in many ways things will be like season one, but for some it may seem kind of weird that she suddenly rekindled her love with the helpless parasite. That is Jerry. We could apply some of the philosophical themes we've identified in earlier quick takes here like starts bad faith and radical freedom, alienation versus agency, but I'm going to propose something a little new to explain why Beth reconnects with Jerry and her overall paradigm shift.

Speaker 1:          03:19          I'm more Fati the cure for common nihilism. Now, what really made me think of this is this moment, my memory is of hating that night, but now reliving at all I can feel is how lucky I am to be loved by such a simple, honest, simple man. This isn't the woman you married, Jerry Beth worried she's the clone must now confront and question her past. Not only is she still thinking about rick's original proposition, the ability to flee her past, but as a possible clone or those memories even her own and what does that mean for her future or her happiness are more fati. Is a Latin phrase that spreading each meister use that means love of fate. A more [inaudible] is the affirmation of life being what Nietzsche called a yes sayer. Not to be confused with the pervasive corporate. Yes ma'am, and it's tied to a thought experiment.

Speaker 1:          04:08          Many refer to as eternal recurrence to simplify. Imagine a demon shows up and says he's going to groundhog day your whole life. You get thrown into existential despair because you have to infinitely relive questionable life moments like the popularity of smash mouth and frosting your tips and middle school, or do you to paraphrase Nietzsche, high five, the demon and say you've never heard of anything more defined to want to relive everything that's happened in your life for eternity. The good, the bad, and everything in between is the ultimate affirmation of life. It's a more foggy and it's part of Nietzsche's grand plan to escape the crushing nihilism of existence. Given Beth's existential crisis and proclivity for rick like disillusionment causing intelligence. Beth has to confront her past. I came to you for help and now I'm insulting your intelligence and look, we're intelligence gets you and with Jerry, she gets to relive a small part of it.

Speaker 1:          04:59          I just thought it lips don't sweat and yes, you may have hated her life the first time around, including her date with Jerry. This time around, she'll be that Nietzschean yes, saving, but I don't think Beth is rewriting the past either. Just didn't deny the years of misery she has endured a more Fati isn't about some kind of. Everything is a blessing in disguise, but it's more about not to shun the ugly aspects of our lives as she tells Jerry, she's no longer the woman he married and sure Jerry may be an idiot, but maybe simplicity is what a person with a family history of using intelligence to justify sickness needs. We see another amore fati moment when Beth. Thanks. Rick has come to retire. Her. I guess I was her, which makes me related to her, but I don't relate to her. She left her family and me, which means I relate to them.

Speaker 1:          05:51          Brushing aside the blade runner, remiss of it all. Beth is also functionally saying yes, a version of Beth have chosen to leave, but I will embrace being left with my family rather than dwell on what could have been and if you let me extrapolate a bit. While there may be infinite universes where rick and Beth has made infinitely different choices, she wants to stay in this one. As Nietzsche says, my formula for greatness is a more fati that one wants nothing to be different, not in the future, not in the past, not for all eternity. While meat, you didn't necessarily philosophize about infinite realities, he did write about the impossible task of knowing oneself. I'm out of excuses to not be who I am. So who am I? What do I do? Beth doesn't know who she is, but desperately wants to. For Niki, the logic of why we actually do anything is impenetrable, and if we want to apply this Nietzschean framing to rick, we the fans almost never know what actually drives him.

Speaker 1:          06:46          Why would you do that for me? I don't know. Maybe you matter so little that I like you or maybe it makes you matter. Maybe I love you, so while Beth confront about whether or not she chose to be cloned or whether or not any of it matters in the infinite versions of herself, Nietzsche would say it really doesn't matter. All we can do is love our faith and that seems to be the choice that Beth is made. And to me, this is really interesting because while the show is often portrayed, rick as a kind of Nietzschean, Uber Manch at war with the meaningless cosmos, there is no god in your face, but rick and uh, quite an uber menschy way doesn't really create his own new meaning as much as he just kind of dicks around in the most self destructive way possible. Beth, on the other hand, when faced with the meaninglessness of the cosmos finds happiness, and that's pretty Uber Menschy.

Speaker 1:          07:32          If you asked me now, if you're like me and don't know what to do with yourself, now that you have to wait probably for ever for season four, consider checking out our wisecrack podcasts, the squash where we broke down every episode of season three.
