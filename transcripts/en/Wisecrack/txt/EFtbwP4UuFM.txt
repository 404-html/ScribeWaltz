Speaker 1:          00:06          wisecrack. Jared, again, we saw your request. So today we're putting the crazy hat back on to dive into the philosophy of grant Morrison. Writer of such a claimed works as also our superman flex men, tallow and multiversity like Alan Moore. Greg Morrison was part of the British invasion that revolutionized comics in the 80s and also like more, he's a self proclaimed magician with an affinity for psychotropic drugs.

Speaker 3:          00:30          To me it just comes in a very simple equation is that wife plus significance equals magic.

Speaker 1:          00:37          But there are major differences between them beyond their obvious discrepancy in haircut philosophy, as insane as more seems Morrison, Mike be even crazier.

Speaker 2:          00:47          Wow.

Speaker 1:          00:50          He wrote some fictional girlfriends for a fictional version of himself in the invisibles and then later claimed that they appeared in real life.

Speaker 3:          00:57          So as a result of this, I just split up with my girlfriend and a silky. I want a new one. Want it to look exactly like this, check in the karmic cause she's cool. So I did, I said to him a monthly they oh tons up. Then another one.

Speaker 1:          01:12          And when he wrote about this fictional grant, morrison being attacked by bacterial, God's a demonic attack and or staph infection brought real life grant morrison to death's doorstep

Speaker 3:          01:22          a that if a, if a pea coat to through the situation where he's been taught to what his lungs had bust and they've just been held in captivity and subject until these awful things, the months late and I'm in hospital, two bus, lungs dying of blood poisoning and facing exactly the same shamonic trial, put my character through

Speaker 1:          01:42          Ben Christ appeared to him after which he was healed and gain the superpower to cure cancer in cats. But all of that pales in comparison to his experience in Katmandu.

Speaker 3:          01:53          It'd been abducted by aliens and count mine in 1994

Speaker 1:          01:56          where he was abducted by rippling dripping blobs of pure holographic metamaterial angels and brought to a mega medium in which entire universes are suspended and shown the nature of reality. Allegedly it was like a Burrito of religious revelation and alien abduction all rolled into one. Whether he actually ascended to a heavenly hyperspace or was just tripping balls is beside the point. There's a surprising amount of sober-minded philosophy and physics that seem to agree with certain aspects of Morrison's Katmandu experience, including why he believes that the universe is essentially just a giant comic book and how he's the midwife to an incredible future wherein we become God. Welcome to this wisecrack edition on the philosophy of grant Morrison spoilers ahead and if you want to dive even deeper into the mind of this mad genius, join us over@wisecrackplus.com for an hour long podcast interview with the creators of this video.

Speaker 1:          02:49          To be clear, Morrison is not suggesting we could ever become the capital g God described in the Bible, Torah or the Quran. You know, a single almighty creator of all things. When comic writers use the Word God, it's more often with a lowercase g like the north stady turned marvel hero, thor or other immensely powerful beings with this logic morrison regards of the Justice League as the Pantheon of American mythology and deliberately structured his roster in Jla two parallel there, Olympian counterparts. Now we want to be very specific in saying that he doesn't merely mean humans will become super power post humans one day. He means something much more. It's Captain Adam who, uh, inspired Moore's doctor Manhattan that gives us our first hint as to what Morrison means by God. Both captain Adam and doctor Manhattan achieved God's status because of their view of time. They experience every event in their lives simultaneously.

Speaker 1:          03:44          It's not that they have perfect recall of the past and total knowledge of the future for them. There is no pastor future. Instead, every single moment is equally, eternally real. Picture a film reel as it rolls forward at 24 frames per second. The light projects one image on the screen at any given moment. In this analogy, the screen is reality and only that single frame is real, uh, frame pops into existence as the projector illuminates it and pops out of existence. As we move on to the next frame, this is what philosopher jme mctaggart calls the theory of time. It's how we as humans perceive time mactaggarts be theory. On the other hand is that events do not have objective tents. So imagine if we were to eliminate each frame of the film reel all at once so that we could simultaneously gaze upon every single moment in the movie.

Speaker 1:          04:33          The main school of thought among be theorists is eternalism, which claims every moment in time is eternal from the big bang to the heat death of the universe. Nothing ever pops in or out of existence, rather events exist alongside one another. The shattering of this illusion is a frequent trope and morrison's writings in the invisibles Lord Fanny's initiation into magic is accomplished at the age of 11 when the remainder of fan, he's life getting raped and beaten and Rio drugged out in a drag club in London, even eventually dying is experienced as if it already happened. The Aztec Goddess Basil Tiotto reveals to Fanny. Time is not a river. Time is more like a bubble, but is to a bubble. What a bubble is to a circle drawn on the ground. So Morrison philosophizes about the nature of time in his stories. Cool, right? Well, he takes it further.

Speaker 1:          05:22          Way further to Morrison. A slightly more literal version of this be theory of time lies in the very medium of the comic book on any given page. If you were to ask the heroes, they tell us that page and that panel was the present moment so far as they could tell, but as the reader we see that all the panels, all the pages, all the printed issues are all equally. Now their time is an illusion, but one, two, which we're not subjected. Even the two dimensional flat piece of paper on which comics are drawn may be an apt analog for the structure of space time per morrison. Our universe may even all be a hologram projected onto a flat mega membrane which is in turn embedded along with many others like it within a higher dimensional space.

Speaker 1:          06:10          He's referring in his own way to the holographic principle per Stephen Hawking. Information associated with all phenomenon in the three dimensional world can be stored on a two dimensional boundary, like a holographic image. In a certain sense, the world would be two dimensional like the pages of a comic book. So far. Everything Morrison said seems like a reasonable conclusion to draw from mainstream theoretical physics and if all he had to say was that just as a film reel is a fitting analogy for eight theory. So two is a comic book and Apt Analogy for the b theory of time, his contribution would be entirely warranted, but then the cat man to experience went down and things got weird. Now, although his more out, their ideas don't necessarily hold up to scientific scrutiny, they're still worth exploring because they take comic books and superheroes stories and turn them into a compelling worldview whether warranted or not.

Speaker 1:          07:02          Many look to figures like superman and captain America for moral inspiration. Morrison offers some justification for emulating fictional heroes, treating them as gods and even go so far as to say that the idea of superman is every bit as real as the idea of God and suggest that we are even more super, even more godlike. It's for this reason that Morrison depicts philosopher Giovanni Pico de la mere and Dola in the pages of all star Superman delivering his famous oration on the dignity of man. As he later said in his autobiography, Pecos Oratoria is without a doubt urging us to go far beyond the human into the realm of angels and Gods. It asks us to accept the superhuman as an undeniable fact of our nature and the goal of our future evolution as a people. Although his metaphors are biblical, suggesting Cherubs and Sarah F's and thrones as our role models and intermediaries on the road to God or cosmic consciousness, we can just as easily call them superheroes.

Speaker 1:          07:59          So what happened at Kathmandu that made Morrison believe that the universe really is a comic book and that humanity really is a superhero? Well, he claims to have stepped outside the multiverse and seeing reality from the outside, the universe, the entire space time continuum from big bang to heat death, no less was not a linear stream of events with beginning, middle and end. That was only how it felt from the inside. All Life on earth was one thing, a single weird anemone like mega hydro with its single celled and mortal route in precambrian tides, a slowly complexifying, increasingly self aware super organism. It was all of us all life as seen from the perspective of a higher dimension, whereas eternalism his content to conclude that spacetime is a timeless four dimensional object. Morrison goes beyond eternal wisdom by claiming that by the same principle every human being is actually a mere sell in a single super organism that is humanity.

Speaker 1:          09:03          And therefore if each one of us is part of a larger hole, then all truism and beneficence and charity are in our own self interest. The simplistic divide of right and wrong and good and evil and superhero comics suddenly seems less silly because our morals aren't arbitrary social constructs. They're the genetic programming instructing this super organism not to destroy itself. Indeed, this view as a basis for ethics is the very conclusion lex luthor reaches when he gains Superman's powers and upon seeing with his super senses all of the fundamental forces and how they're interconnected, he begins to weep. This is how he sees all the time every day like it's all just us in here together and we're all we've got, okay, so if humanity as a whole is like a superhero comic book, we should therefore behave like these costume do gooders. It's a compelling case, but if you think that's weird, he also saw fifth dimensional aliens or what he called mercurial, hyper sprites, five dimensional intelligence as could as a condition of their geometrically elevated position.

Speaker 1:          10:09          Get into our skulls quite easily and we could expect their voices to come from inside. They in turn could hear our thoughts as easily as we can read Batman's private inner monologues on a two d page. This is illustrated in multiversity, Pax Americana Number One, while reading a comic book Captain Adam uses to two scientists. The stories linear, but I can flip through the pages in any order, any direction forward in time. To the conclusion, back to the opening scene, the characters remained unaware of my scrutiny, but their thoughts are transparent, weightless and little clouds. This is how a two dimensional continuum looks to you. Then staring straight ahead. He says, imagine how your three d world appears to me. Adam's fourth wall break brings us to another major theme in Morrison's Works Meta fiction Alec, which is the exploration of the relationship between the fiction itself with the real world of the writer and reader Morrison first wrestled with [inaudible] in the final issue of his run on animal man in which he dawned what he calls a fiction suit.

Speaker 1:          11:12          He inserts himself into the comic itself to interact with the character he notes. I explained to my character how the people who wrote his life needed drama and shock and violence to make his story interesting. The implication was that our own lives may be written to entertain or to instruct an audience in a perpendicular direction. We could never point to interacting with us in ways we could scarcely understand, but that could be divided in the relationship of the comic world to the world of the Creator and audience. This is the crux that connects Morrison's metta fiction to his musings on spacetime. If comic books reflect the nature of our universe, can we say that the physical comic like universe reflects the nature of some higher reality? Who are our cosmic comic creators who writes the plotlines of history, pencils, the particle interactions, letters, the thought balloons of intelligent minds?

Speaker 1:          12:03          Morrison's answer is the fifth dimensional aliens that we cannot grasp with our feeble three dimensional mines, but he admits the particulars are less important than the implications that follow from there being intelligent designers. If the analogy of our universe being like a comic book extends so far as to suggest that it has something like a writer, then the mere fact that it is a written work implies a purposefulness to our existence. Now, of course, being created doesn't necessarily in part dignity, we might be like morrisons animal man with all our suffering for no greater purpose can to provide drama in a piece of cheap entertainment. We might be made by a hack. Our whole purpose might be to pass butter, but contra his younger self. When writing animal man, the more mature Morrison became more optimistic in flex men, tallow man of muscle mystery. Morrison once again used [inaudible] as a means of exploring questions about our own purpose.

Speaker 1:          12:57          Just as Morrison sees, reality is having a three tiered structure with his fifth dimensional emcee at the top, the two d comic book characters at the bottom and us in the middle. So two is the story of flexpen tallow set across three levels of reality. There's the cartoon world of Flex Metallo. The realistic world of Flexes Writer Wall is sage and Avatar, Morrison himself, and yet a higher reality inhabited by superheroes more real than they're writers or the fifth dimensional aliens. In the story, it's revealed that superheroes, instead of being merely a product of the imagination of writers like wally, were in fact the beings that created wally's entire world after which they retreated in the imagination, seeding our culture with superhero stories in anticipation of the day that mere mortals are ready to become like them. As a result, humanity only needs to resolve their uncertainty about whether superheros are real or not, and decide to believe them into existence here, Morrison to suggesting a much more dignified purpose to our existence.

Speaker 1:          14:00          We're meant to discover our fundamental purpose in the pages of comic books and to believe into existence. The idea of the superman to incarnate him in ourselves for Morrison, the medium of comics and the plot structure of superhero stories are so closely connected in our culture because both are parts of the same pattern that explained everything else in existence. In recognizing this pattern, Morrison writes his own autobiography, Super Gods in the style and structure of an archetypical superhero story, including a secret origin in Glasgow, the call to adventure, a top Katmandu and a death and rebirth in which he brings the hidden knowledge he gained on his hero's journey to the comics community, and while that hidden knowledge is parsed out in piecemeal and his comics writing, it's in super gods where he's most explicit about just what makes humankind itself a Super God. Already we can see humankind is having all the attributes of comic book superheroes or even Pagan Gods.

Speaker 1:          14:58          Whereas mercury carried messages at the speed of thought to the Roman gods. We have instantaneous interconnectivity via the internet, whereas heme dolls all seeing I could spy everywhere in all nine realms are satellites can zoom in on any spot on earth like superman. We flown faster than a speeding bullet. Humanity when viewed as a whole is already a super God insofar as there is no future frames of the film reel popping into existence. We are not becoming the Super God. We already always are. This epic of human history is merely its secret origin story as to how it gets it's superhuman powers, but all of its ongoing adventures and never ending battles to come are all already written, published, printed, and on the shelves of some higher dimensional comic shop. If mankind is this super organism with all these stupendous powers who supposed to act according to the simple morality of a superhero whose whole history is structured like a superhero story and who's living in a cosmos that's constructed like a comic book, then Morrison's obvious conclusion is this.

Speaker 1:          16:02          Mankind's purpose is to be a superhero. It's for this reason that Morrison calls the Sun God from Smallville, our greatest ever idea as the human species. Not because superman was the prototype on which all other superheroes would be based, but because he is the template for which these Super God, if humanity must become all powerful and all good all at the same time. This is the summation of Morrison's philosophy articulated Bestbuy Jarell to his one and only son regarding the essential truth about man and superman and not the mankind within the comics, but the mankind reading comics. You have given them an ideal to aspire to embodied their highest aspirations. They will race and stumble and fall and crawl and curse and finally they will join you in the Sun Palau, but hey, whether or not we accomplish wonders, the doctors who work with hymns have come pretty close.
