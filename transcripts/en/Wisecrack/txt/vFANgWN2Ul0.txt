Speaker 1:          00:03          Hey wise cracks jared again, like everyone else. Sometimes I just need to laugh the pain away. Often the crushing anxiety of existence may feel like too much, but hey, that's why I have a dog. It helps. We are wise crack, love us a month. He Python, these wildly bridge redefined comedy in the 1970s and are still hugely influential. Just look at comedies today, South Park, rick and morty or even deadpool, all hilarious in their own unique ways, but without Monte python they probably wouldn't even exist. Monte Python paved the way for comedy as we know it. Combining absurdity satire and Post Warner reflexivity and the some of the most influential and quoted comedies ever an x. So because there's nothing funnier than explaining a joke to death. Welcome in his wise crack condition on the legacy of Monte Python. Oh, and we'll be answering your questions for the first hour and the comments.

Speaker 1:          00:56          Soap Z, you, they're part one postmodernism, like a hipster and a gluten free juice bar. Postmodernism is everywhere these days. Jurassic World Star Wars, family guy. Pretty much anything you can think of. These films and TV shows constantly refer back to themselves, commenting on the narrative conventions and iconography of their predecessors. It's another desktop. I wish that were the case major. This was the death star and this is star killer base or well just copying them wholesale, but nothing encapsulates this movement more than deadpool. Heck, we even did an entire philosophy of on this exact subject, everyone loves deadpool because quite simply he doesn't give up. He's rebelliously self-aware, repeatedly winking at his own narrative and mocking the superhero genre. Okay, let's pro con this superhero thing. This constant self reflexivity encapsulates postmodernism first coined by the French philosopher John Francois Leotard in 1979 for Leotard. All stories previously told fit into off, told grand mythologies, great heroes on a voyage for some grandiose goal, or as he referred to them metanarratives her leotard. These metanarratives were stories that provided a pattern and structure for people's beliefs. Teaching viewers a universal insight. Think of the wizard of Oz and how when you strip it of all the flying monkeys and melting witches, it's actually just a story about a girl realizing that

Speaker 2:          02:25          there's no place like,

Speaker 1:          02:27          or even the fast and the furious underneath all the ludicrous car stunts. There's a deeper meta-narrative about the importance of family through these stories. Morals and social customs are taught and reinforced, but postmodernism subverts these grand narratives revealing the chaos and disorder beneath, like say Deadpool, a comic book character who constantly tears down everything that comic book stand for.

Speaker 2:          02:50          You're probably thinking, my boyfriend said this was a superhero movie, but that guy in the red suit just turn that other guy into a Kebab.

Speaker 1:          02:57          But as edgy as deadpool may seem, he ain't got shit on the pythons who took postmodern deconstruction to a whole other level. Case in point there all time. Classic Monty Python and the holy grail. Whereas deadpool lampoons only the comic book meta-narrative Monty Python and the holy grail is defined by breaking down multiple Meta narratives among them are 30 and chivalry, Christianity logic, and the very medium of film itself. The first of these metanarratives are three in chivalry. First of all, from the late Middle Ages, idealizing nights as honorable and self sacrificing. You know, the usual nightlys like protecting the week, showing mercy to enemies, never lying and championing truth, injustice, but monty python and the holy grail completely dismantles and mocks these time tested tenant.

Speaker 3:          03:47          Who's that

Speaker 1:          03:52          when Sir Robin and counters, a three headed giant is minstrel sing the heroic narrative that everyone expects.

Speaker 3:          04:03          He was not afraid to die,

Speaker 1:          04:07          but Robin himself runs the hell away as quickly as possible.

Speaker 3:          04:11          Great. Good. All good.

Speaker 1:          04:17          Similarly in the Arthurian legend, Arthur's arrival at camelot is usually treated as an emotional high point in his story, comma, Tamil. Yet monty python undercuts the seriousness of the moment, turning this hallmark event into a goofy musical number and then to top it off, Arthur decides not to even bother going to camelot.

Speaker 3:          04:47          No, I'm sick and bolts. Let's not go to camelot. It is a silly place.

Speaker 1:          04:51          Each of our supposed great heroes are revealed to be far less than they claim the power hungry. Arthur demands that every peasant acknowledge him as their king.

Speaker 4:          05:02          No king,

Speaker 1:          05:04          but if they dare question his rule, he immediately attacks them.

Speaker 4:          05:11          I'm being repressed. Oh, want to give it? Why'd you have that Julia? The, that's what I'm on about sir.

Speaker 1:          05:17          Galahad the pure, the most faithful of nights is to deuced in less than four minutes by a company of 160 lonely women. And when Lancelot received a note from a distressed maiden, he rushes to rescue her in the process birders dozens of unarmed people. Then in the end, it turns out there wasn't even a maiden to save in the first place. I told you I hopping on just find that monty python users, postmodernism to illustrate how the stories people tell themselves enables some awful Lancelot and Arthur's own metanarratives justifying their violent and oppressive acts. The fact that these men and narratives aren't even true to begin with is just the icing on the cake as our nightly heroes are revealed to be cowards, hypocrites, and violence. Sociopaths.

Speaker 5:          05:58          Can you see what I mean? I just get carried away. I'm sorry. Sorry. Sorry.

Speaker 1:          06:03          Even God has put into doubt per the Christianity meta-narrative God is good and all powerful and has a plan for humanity. Yet in monty python and the holy grail, God isn't great. Then kind at all. He's just a cranky Dick who's really crappily animated philosopher Mikael boxton define this as the downward swing, which I swear isn't a baseball term per boxton. Most stories are upward swings and that they elevate a story, toy, symbolic state and make them universal. On the contrary, in a downward swing, the classical story becomes so distorted and grotesque that you don't even know whether to scream, cry, or laugh, and it's not just the story that becomes distorted, but also we the readers and viewers ourselves. Every lesson we learned through the Meta narrative is now cast into doubt. Right alongside it, take one of the most famous scenes in the holy Grail, the witch trial, Sir Avir, the ys puts a poor woman through a foolproof logic test in order to determine if she's a witch, her bed, a beer which is burned at the stake, just like wood and wood floats on water, just like a duck.

Speaker 1:          07:07          So if the woman is a, which he will weigh the same as a duck, Monte Python here takes formal logic and distorted it into a grotesque version of itself in effect, casting doubt on our own fundamental faith in logic. If classical logic can be distorted into justifying a woman's death, then how can it be truly trusted at all? By the end of the Holy Grail, this distortion extends to the very film itself. As Arthur prepares for an epic battle with the French at castle ard Modern Day police suddenly arrive in arrest of the king for murder. The beliefs then push and cover the camera Lens, breaking the fourth wall, making the audience cognitive to the fact they're watching a movie. The holy grail constantly pokes fun at itself for being a movie. For instance, the film's title credits or undermined when Swedish subtitles suddenly appear promoting the country as a terrific vacation spot.

Speaker 1:          07:52          The credit makers are then promptly fired, causing the credit format to completely change throughout the film. Arthur Hughes's coconuts instead of eight course due to the films tight budget and later Arthur even refers to one character as we'll see in 2012 and just the hammer, the point home, the night's defeat, the legendary black beast of art, not through any battle or test of wills, but because the anime or that design the creature as a heart attack. This self reflexivity reveals the holy grail to be its own metanarrative film just as artificial as the chivalrous are 30 in heroes with him.

Speaker 6:          08:29          Oh, come on. You Go.

Speaker 1:          08:34          That's just how postmodern monty python and the holy grail truly is it deconstructs religion and logic within a deconstruction of heroic tropes within a deconstruction of the film medium itself. Basically the inception of postmodern phil part to the comedy of the absurd. There's probably no show is popular on the interwebs as rick and morty. I mean be honest. Wisecracks really just the domain switch away from becoming a rick and morty fan club and that's because the show always ties. It's absurd. Humor with thought provoking insights like well on the meaninglessness of life as a bitch. Take the get the episode when massive heads suddenly appear all across the planet, many people begin to worship. The head says God starting up a cult and even sacrificing people to appease them. Of course, in reality, these heads aren't gods at all, but an alien race that just wants Earth to participate in an American idol like reality show.

Speaker 1:          09:29          This type of humor is known as the comedy of the absurd. This existential base comedy focuses on the fallout when confronted with a world devoid of meaning. However, instead of wallowing in some murky woe is me despair. The absurd takes the opposite approach, pointing out the broad humor and our own tragic insignificance. These tragic absurdity is foundational to Monty Python's brand of humor and their third feature of the life of Brian Poor. Brian's entire existence is one big absurd misunderstanding. The humble peasant is born in the stable. Next to Jesus, confusing the three wiseman who assumed beaten, not special at all. Brian, to be the messiah.

Speaker 7:          10:06          Here's the son of God, King of the Jews, Catholic. What is it?

Speaker 1:          10:12          The projection of significance on the insignificant is a hallmark of existential thought. I particular our boy Albert Kamoo, who rejected this desperate search for meaning and instead embraced the guest. It absurd when Brian runs away from his disciples, they mistakenly believe he's risen to heaven, and later when Brian loses a sandal, these same disciples per claim, the Sandal, his side. Of course, Brian didn't mean for the same old to be anything more than footwear, and yet people in their desire for meaning attribute significance to even the silliest of objects.

Speaker 7:          10:46          Will

Speaker 1:          10:50          we see this exact same misappropriation of meaning and get swifty as principal vagina and the rest of his colts mistake the alien heads as gods when actually they're only reality TV show junkies comedies of the absurd draw their humor from this discrepancy between what is and what isn't between what's true and what people believe to be true. Characters in these absurd comedies are often caught in hopeless situations, forced into repetitive and ultimately fruitless actions like Brian who constantly tries to tell his disciples he's not the Messiah, but too little avail. No matter what Brian does, his disciples grow in number and become ever more fervent, all leading to a horrific and tragic conclusion. Crucifixion, yet, despite his impending doom, Brian's comforted by his fellow crucifixion buddies who break out into song,

Speaker 8:          11:42          go wines. Look on the Bra,

Speaker 1:          11:49          the Crucifixion Buddies, cheerful lament reflects the myth of in which poor sisyphus is Kirsch to roll a rock up a mountain, only for it to fall back down over and over again. Camou famously applied the Greek men to life itself. The trick though is not to let this meaninglessness ever gets you down instead. In the words of life of Brian, always look at the bright side because when faced with our own insignificance and impending doom, there's only one real option. Though it may seem completely absurd. Laughter, part three, political satire. Nowadays, satire has become more vital than ever, whether via late night talk shows like full frontal with Samantha Bee or more traditional half hour comedies like southpark hell. The last three seasons of Southpark focused heavily on the 2016 election and the trump presidency, I don't give two shits about a treaty. You're a Polish, midget political satires like southpark derive their humor by revealing the hypocrisy in established rules and orders.

Speaker 1:          12:45          Allow the 2016 election and the PC brigade, but way before South Park, Monte Python paved the way, subverting the established political ideologies of England. In fact, southpark creators, Trey Parker and Matt Stone often cite Monte Python as the single biggest influence on their show. Matt and I met and got along so well because we were just pure python freaks in Monte Python's final and darkest feature the meaning of life, the pythons openly comment on English, imperialism, economic disparity, and the classes, social hierarchies of the country. The opening mini movie be Crimson. Permanent Assurance depicts a group of poor elderly workers forced into a pirate like frenzy by young American yuppies. The old workers rebelled against these Yuppie Dick's, throwing them out windows to their death and then proceed to destroy every shiny bright corporate building in their path, bringing down the system that literally anchored them to the ground. The pythons carry the city miracle.

Speaker 1:          13:39          Look at capitalism throughout the film, questioning the economic notion that self-interest results in the greater good. In fact, we see quite the opposite in the sketch, the miracle of birth. The doctors are far more concerned with their fancy equipment and impressing their administrator than the poor woman they're operating on. I get the most expensive machines in case the administrator comes later in the sketch. Live organ transplants to bureaucrats. Fortunately remove the liver from an impoverished man for the good of the country, remarking nonsensically that they must kill the guy that they can then take his liver.

Speaker 1:          14:14          Met Him. He constantly, we see people drowning under this system. Britain's Yorkshire is ironically referred to as a third world country and in the same sketch, a poor man is forced to sell off his children to science in order to make ends meet this economic disparity. Climaxes in the sketch the autumn years or the grotesquely obese and rich Mr Creosote dines at a fancy restaurant eating more and more until he literally explodes. The implications couldn't be clear. The rich get richer and fatter at the expense of the starving lower class, but it's not just social injustice that the python, but the whole notion of British imperialism in general, the hand of God strikes down a military officer who insists Britain will always need an army to put down differing ideologies and in the same sketch, a sergeant major drills his platoon on whether they have anything better to do. Then march up and down the town square. Well, it turns out they do.

Speaker 4:          15:09          Well, to be quite honest. Sij I'd rather be at home with the wife and kids now. Yes, Taj, right off you go

Speaker 1:          15:20          like read a book or go to the movies or really anything at all. The pythons even state this central thesis at the end of the picture.

Speaker 4:          15:27          I'm trying to be nice to people to avoid eating fat. Read a good book every now and then. Get some walking in and try and live together in peace and harmony with people of all creeds and nations.

Speaker 1:          15:35          For the pythons. British imperialism is a threat to the meaning of life. This manifests in their depiction of war where soldiers attempting to celebrate a birthday our gun down one by one, the brutal reality of war of supposed imperial conquests juxtaposed against the simple pleasure of enjoying a birthday cake. These ideas extended their sketch show the flying circus. The show often portrays bureaucrats is buffoons or as sticks in the mud constantly censoring the show itself.

Speaker 7:          16:02          Pet was to my nine of inquiry feathers. She's getting to city. It's silly. It's silly, it's silly, right? Get on with it. Get on with this.

Speaker 1:          16:13          For hitchens, one set, the essential founding gag of monty python is the bubbling magma of absurdity that lay beneath the fragile crust of British reserve. At any moment, a man with a bowler hat or an umbrella might become a raging crossdresser or barking savers. It's this unpredictability, this mixture between the postmodern, the political and the absurd that makes Monte Python unlike any comedy troop that came before or after. By merging together social commentary, existential angst and just plain old silliness. The pythons always keep you on your toes. They defied convention. Concocting a brand of comedy, so singular that a word has been created just for that pythonesque today. Their brand of humor permeates every facet of the comedic landscape. As always.
