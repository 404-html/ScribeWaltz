Speaker 1:          00:07          Personally,

Speaker 2:          00:12          it's a very, very complicated answer. I think they should definitely be there as a last resort and probably for catastrophic health insurance, but I think you know, there's a question, well, should the government pay for healthcare? And if you say yes to that and think you solved the problem, you haven't because the question becomes, well, how much healthcare should they pay for? Should they pay for the 80 year old lady who's a vegetable to stay alive? Another six months? Should they pay for the liver transplant of the 40 year old alcoholic, uh, should they pay for the, the operation on the guy who refused to wear his helmet and the motorcycle up? Our resources are finite and we need to do a much better job of figuring out where we spend them in where we don't. And right now we make a lot of these decisions opaquely.

Speaker 2:          01:12          If you're black and poor, chances are you're not going to get good healthcare care if you're rich and white. Even if you didn't pay your insurance, chances are you know somebody who knows somebody at Mount Sinai, so you're going to get better cancer operation. You live in Iowa and there's a certain operation that might cure you, but they offered only in Seattle, you're probably not going to get that operation and we're never going to have a world of equality of outcome, but we should at least have a world of equality of opportunity and we shouldn't kid ourselves that. Every life is infinitely more valuable than anything else. We make trade offs all the time. We. We don't feed children right in school. We we destroy lives much earlier than when they show up in the hospital and so the problem is we don't like to confront these decisions just as you might not like to confront decisions about that.

Speaker 2:          02:18          I mentioned earlier that your personal life, we as a society feel uncomfortable with explicit rules. Yet those things get adjudicated all the time. Just quietly, and I didn't really answer your question, but I think at the at the day to day care, people should pay their own costs, but the. The real issue is how it had to design a system than incentivize healthy behavior because most of the healthcare costs in this country are due to either end of life or what is essentially the results of bad behavior. Uh, heart disease, lung cancer, diabetes, they're not assigned that you've been bad, but they are aggravated by poor nutritional habits, lack of exercise, all these things. And if we could just get people to adopt much healthier lifestyles or medical costs will go down, but I don't really want the government monitoring what people eat either. So the challenge is how to change social norms without brainwashing people, let them understand their genetic information, educate them better at school.

Speaker 2:          03:33          And I mean it really the, the one that's, you know, Mcdonald's has a huge role to play in this just by what they offer people to eat. If, if the food companies could start promoting genuinely healthy food rather than kind of what does it truthiness fruitiness where you put chemicals into something and claim that it's more healthy because it has some kind of one piece of nutrition. It's sort of like if you put please into something saying that it's polite, you know, and the thing is still rude, so it's, it's extremely complicated and more information is a start more information about the impact of the kind of food we just as in the environment, more information about the impact of the kinds of things we drive or the stuff we use or the cost of air conditioning, that kind of thing.
