Speaker 1:          00:00          This video is sponsored by honey, the browser extension that gets you the best prices on everything you buy online. Hey wise crack. Jared here with our third and final exploration of Christopher Nolan's weird wild mind. And our first installment, we examined Nolan's idea of the self charting the relationships between our subjective perceptions and the notion of objective reality. Unfortunately, our investigation's still came too late to save poor teddy. In the second installment, we use no one's dark knight trilogy to discuss the fragile dynamics of society and the ways in which social norms are tested and upended by symbols, by desire, and all too often by hoking Weirdos in mass.

Speaker 2:          00:44          Good.

Speaker 1:          00:47          And now in our third act will attempt to find some catharsis by looking to the universe per response to the fragile nature of humanity. I want to know where we are. So strap in because this is the final installment of the philosophy of Christopher Nolan. Oh, and we'll be answering your questions for the first hour in the comments. So we'll see you there. And of course spoilers ahead. Whereas no one's previous works focused on the inevitable conflict inherent in humanities. Rational nature, interstellar attempts to transcend these burdens by looking to the broad expanses of the universe and hopes of ridding us from the social and physical restraints explored in videos one and two of this series. By merging a sense of wide eyed wonder with the thrilling advancements of science, Nolan Helps Cooper and us break free of the expectations leveled against the self and society from as early as it's opening scenes.

Speaker 1:          01:36          Interstellar situates his protagonists cooper as an ambitious innovator, but also as a clear, I'd advocate for science and reason with facts and present your conclusion. He's also a guy with a pretty healthy skepticism of power and authority. It's an old federal textbook. We've replaced them with the corrected versions, correct, but before the films adventure is done with him, Cooper will have to reconcile his data driven beliefs with the mind expanding unpredictability of the great beyond. Although cooper is firmly committed to his own sense of practicality, is eventually forced to navigate the fluid boundary between the real and the Iran deal. The latter of which is a concept introduced by American philosopher Nelson Goodman, but what is the aerial exactly in his work? The ways of rope making good and explored the notion of alternative world versions at its most basic interpretation. This concept allowed for everything from art to mathematics to be perceived and understood in a variety of ways.

Speaker 1:          02:33          Take a look at this piece of art for example, and you might see a woman's face or a goblet. Both interpretations here are correct in total, but only one interpretation is correct through one particular context at a time, and this in essence is the art of the realities. There are multiple ways to look at the world and no one method is better in every instance. As such, the way the film's mysterious beings experienced the universe opens up a for a new way to experience and know the universe, just not in the way we're used to with you know, time is a thing that passes in space. Cooper is confronted with the real, nothing abides by his conventional ideas of time or even cause and effect. Cooper as a man of science has some difficulty adjusting to a new normal and through that difficult adjustment, no one is openly able to question me. Physical, spatial and chronological laws that we and cooper, how long the leave to be absolute throughout much of interstellar hyman space do not interact with us in a way we might traditionally expect and neither as it turns out, does all American hero Matt Damon on a new plane of existence in which even time can be warped

Speaker 3:          03:43          gravity on that planet will slow our clock compared to Earth's drastically. Every hour we spend on that planet will be seven years back on her.

Speaker 1:          03:52          What asks, Nolan is left to ground us humans. What lighthouse is there to help us navigate, to give us purpose and direction? Thankfully, interstellar not only poses this question, it provides an answer and that answer is the one place technology cannot touch human emotion. Although the characters of interstellar frequently doubt what is real and what is trustworthy there snot filled, tear drench deeply emotional experiences provide them with the ballast focus and resolve to see their adventure through to the end and those components of humanity or the very sorts of things. Science alone can't provide. In fact, near the beginning of the film, it's suggested the crash landing that stalled Cooper's aviation career was the result of his reliance on technology alone.

Speaker 3:          04:37          We should ease Andrew. I can see him case. The only time I ever went down in the machine was easy and at the wrong time.

Speaker 1:          04:43          Ultimately, it's human connection and emotion and capsulated in doctor brands. Love for Dr Edmonds.

Speaker 3:          04:49          Love is the one thing we're capable of perceiving that transcends dimensions of time and space

Speaker 1:          04:54          that leads this crew to the habitable planet they so desperately seek. Now, that's not to say the film is anti-science far from it. Instead, it demonstrates something more complex that science is necessary, but by itself is an insufficient condition for a journey of discovery. Science alone can't solve our problems of limited resources, identity, or societal violence. In interstellar. Science needs something more. It needs emotion. It needs love to fuel and guided. It requires human subjectivities that launches us beyond facts and figures and shiny chrome.

Speaker 3:          05:30          They have access to infinite time and space, but they're not bound by anything. They can find a specific place in time we can communicate. That's why I'm, yeah,

Speaker 1:          05:41          and in that sense, interstellar represents something of a capstone in the Christopher Nolan experience in the face of the questions of identity that arrives from the self and from society. Interstellar responds by showing how scientific advancements merged with the intangibles of the human. Provide us with the necessary thrust or new frontiers and personal liberation.

Speaker 4:          06:02          If there's an answer here on earth, it's back there somehow in that room.

Speaker 1:          06:07          Of course, the technology exhibited an interstellar is not up today's world. It's instead rooted in speculative fiction, and that's where the film itself even acts as an elegant marriage of science and imagination. It shows us worlds and innovations we've never seen before with interstellar. Christopher Nolan confronts us with the power of hyper [inaudible] cinema, image driven storytelling up an imagined future that can influence and emotionally fuel us in the present. And that future urges us to make the Iran real real, even if we have to crawl to the uncertainties of time and space to do it. At least we're fueled by love along the way with interstellar, no one presents new worlds and realities that push us far from the violence, self destructive climate of the dark knight trilogy or Memento. And in these new worlds, no one offers us an optimistic glimpse of our own possible future.

Speaker 1:          06:56          So why did he follow this story with Dunkirk? A film about the allied evacuation from bloody war time conflict in 1940 the short answer perhaps is that Dunkirk is about our future too. In both interstellar and Dunkirk. Nolan unites his audience in celebrating the indomitable spirit of the human. The notion that man and woman is essentially good. The notion that each of us is built to persevere. This is evidenced in much of Christopher Nolan's recent work, including the dark knight rises. When catwoman tells Batman she's bailing and assures him she's no hero, I'll open that tunnel. Then I'm gone only to prove herself wrong in the 11th hour, how sweet interstellar furthers this cheerful embrace of human decency and capability by using love to push cooper all the way to the end of his journey. Cooper's own indomitable spirit, powerfully fueled by the love for his daughter proves enough to ensure his success.

Speaker 1:          07:48          What could be a clear example of that emotional potency that unflappable will to persevere? Then both the British referred to as the dunkirk spirit, a term that's been used to convey solidarity since the days of that bloody battle in World War II, the dunkirk spirit is defined by a sense of community, a willingness by a group of people who are in a bad situation to all help each other. The film invest a deep sense of communal spirit, a spirit best embodied in Mr. Dawson. Despite lacking any military technology. This guy pilots is small boat into violent conflict, commits himself to saving the lives of strangers and emerges victorious thanks to the sheer power of will you have a tender on? Oh, we have a job to do. Mister Dawson's instrumentation is not technical, but internal. The step beyond interstellar and the purest possible connection between the self society and the spiritual unknown, much like Doctor Emilia brand and interstellar, Mr. Dawson, it's resolutely piloted by love, but while Mr. Dawson was unable to save his son, he is in a sense still able to save the conceptual image of his son with each life. Mr. Dawson rescues during dunkirk escape.

Speaker 5:          08:56          How'd you know that stuff? Anyway, our son was running you loud. I know she is,

Speaker 1:          09:00          and you know what? That achievement might just be something even more noble and significant in the realm of the indomitable human spirit. Dunkirk suggests sometimes the Iran deal is more real than real. Not only is this scene in the choices the characters make, but in the way the film is constructed. Dunkirk is structured in such a way as to reveal the purest distillation of this communal concept.

Speaker 5:          09:22          I didn't want to tell the story in words I didn't want people, I didn't want the theatrical. If people telling the audience why you should care about, I wanted to care about him just because of the physical situation or they were in

Speaker 1:          09:35          where many of Nolan's previous films have been criticized for being too long to dialogue heavy and expository dunkirk hawks in and only 107 minutes offers backstory for almost none of its characters and really doesn't have much interest in conversation. In other words, no one created a sense of solidarity between the viewers and soldiers without relying on the tools often used to draw in audiences. Essentially it plunks us here with every bullet fired in with every ship destroyed. Dunkirk aims to access the psychological concept of an affective empathy, the ability not just to know or to understand what someone is feeling, but to feel that feeling before it occurs in interviews about the production of Dunkirk, no one said his ambition was to create virtual reality without the headset. In other words, a fully an effective experience for the viewer, whether Nolan's successfully reached this goal is up to each individual viewer to decide, but the blending of science, technology, and imagination to create an immersive sense of participation in the dunkirk spirit.

Speaker 1:          10:31          Well, that might just be Nolan's loudest call to each of us to bind together in shaping and perfecting the self, society, and future that we want. No one's most recent film, didn't just bring him a boatload of Oscar nominations. It also brought together the threads of his earlier work, ultimately illustrating the power of love and the human spirit. Christopher Nolan is one of the most interesting filmmakers working today. His movies aren't only visceral and exciting, but also extremely thoughtful, a rare blend in today's Hollywood. This is merely our interpretation of his work, but as with any mastercraftsman, his work will continue to inspire new thought for years to come. Thanks for watching guys.
