Speaker 1:          00:00          This video is brought to you by morning brew, the daily email newsletter covering the latest news from Wall Street to Silicon Valley. More Info on morning brew at the end of this video. What's up guys? Helen here. If you ask anyone to explain why they love Nathan for you, they'll probably say some iteration of good. Just have to watch it. Nathan fielder paints a bizarre picture of America, colored by strange individuals ranging from the verbally abusive private investigator. You remind me of the wizard of loneliness to the ex con Santa Claus to the Stalker Esque Bill Gates impersonator. On one level, Nathan's impossibly complex and nonsensical plans belie analysis, but as you already know, that's not gonna. Stop us because Paul, all the insanity, the show crackles with brilliant commentary holding up a mirror to the absurdity of running a modern business. Welcome to this wisecrack addition on Nathan for you and sort of maybe kind of spoilers ahead. Here's the premise of the show and your typical episode of Nathan for you host. Nathan fielder introduces us to one or more struggling business owners and proposals that cockamamie plan to improve their luck. You'll let minors purchase alcohol, but then held it in a storage locker until their 21st birthday, a plaza liquor would gain a ton of new underwriter customers. Then we watch the plan escalate, deviate, and almost inevitably fail

Speaker 2:          01:22          for this mash up of retail and its history.

Speaker 1:          01:29          Try and wreck on the most basic level. Many of the plots, Nathan, can reveal something about the strained relationship between morality and economic realities. To seriously are they talking about putting a banner that says we sell liquor to minors. Nathan has described the way the series was born, partially out of his own obsession with the 2008 economic collapse in which risky bank behavior took down the global economy. What really fascinated him was the way this cataclysmic fiscal rap was the result of thousands and thousands of seemingly mundane moments like when one guy must have known his boss's credit default swap magic was a bunch of woo in nearly every episode of Nathan for you. He makes us live through these kinds of sickening moments after he pitched and absurd sometimes immoral idea to a business owner. The plan turned the job of moving into America's next fitness craze.

Speaker 1:          02:22          Watch each person reluctantly agreed to ideas that will likely mislead. Exploit the labor of insult or terrified customer. I think you'll get a lot more people if they just think it's a workout and we don't tell them that they're actually doing free labor. There's the antique store owner who tepidly extends her business hours to lauren drunk customers who are going to fall prey to the stores. You break it, you buy it policy. I just wouldn't prefer a broken item. I'd rather sell a good one, but yeah, I mean it would be the same thing no matter what happens. So during each of these moments, the owner's reluctance is palpable, but it's typically eclipsed by their desire to improve their business to please Nathan. Probably people will think that way. Yeah. Or simply just say on tv, you know, I want to see what, how it works. I would love to have this information and then if I have the use, yes, why not? She was engaged. Typically they'll justify it as a means of achieving bottom line profits anytime. Removing any product. It's always beneficial to stores in this subset of Nathan's pranks, watching decent human beings cajoled into small acts of immorality, ranges from painfully uncomfortable to flat out on believable. Okay. You know the drill, right? It's the last stop.

Speaker 1:          03:37          Take the time. Nathan convinces this man that he's being hired as a shell pr representative enticed by the incentive of a good job. The man is willing to say things like this.

Speaker 3:          03:46          This mill right here, this building a relatively small. If you had to have a spill somewhere, you would want this. Bill Mason

Speaker 1:          03:54          highlights the way a system that emphasizes personal gains at the expense of community good sets up decent human beings to become their worst selves,

Speaker 4:          04:02          and these are for people that you cut in front of that you thought you were better than including a nine year old girl.

Speaker 1:          04:10          Part of the strength of Nathan satire comes from the fact that each of his ideas have some real world basis. He takes business antics that we're generally pretty comfortable with and transports them to a place of queasy moral, including. For example, in the toy company episode, he takes a familiar kind of advertising, again, targeted towards children owning a doin kid is now the only proof that you are not a baby here, nice and reveals something uncomfortable about businesses that stealthily exploit or worst insecurities to get a piece of our hard earned paycheck. Nathan, for you showcases the struggle of the small business owner trying to compete in the global economy. Subverting the narrative that anyone willing to work hard can simply pull themselves up by their own bootstraps. Nathan puts his own spin on the American dream by first giving us the classic protagonist, a hardworking cab driver or electronic store owner. It's horrible. I mean it's, it's, it's, it's, it's bad for small business and he paints his own presence as the savvy business consultant or the dose of luck they need to revitalize their business,

Speaker 4:          05:15          but maybe there's a shortcut to actually having brand recognition using a little something called parody law.

Speaker 1:          05:21          What's the goal? Isn't actually to help the businesses find success. It's to underscore the absurdity super officiality and futility of modern day business in the first place. For instance, even when his scheme to make an elaborately orchestrated video, that pig rescuing the golden a petting zoo go viral, actually worked. He perversely left the zoo's name out of the video.

Speaker 4:          05:41          I didn't want it to come across like an ad for the petting zoo. I thought it'd be a bit transparent so that if people would have known that it was old tree village can be so selfish. This

Speaker 1:          05:52          mistake is a gag that actually gets to the heart of the show's mission. The short lifespan of any viral animal video pretty much ensures the fact that even if properly advertised, the petting zoo would have quickly faded back into cultural oblivion. Nathan just expedited the process. Even when Nathan's plans do succeed in the short term, they're typically two implausible to survive in the longterm. Los Angeles Health Department shut down dumb starbucks yesterday because it did not have proper permits. Usually the business owner ends up exactly where they started and just maybe the show is highlighting the impossibility of going up against big business even when your plans are insane and involve alligators. This is never more clear than when Nathan attempts to take on a global brands. In one episode, he tries to help an electronic store owner compete with best buy. Their sales are ridiculous. I mean there's no way that I can compete.

Speaker 1:          06:48          Part of the problem is best buy's price match policy in which they promise to match any price from neighboring stores preventing anyone from underselling them faith and proposes. They use price match against the company by offering to sell TVs for $1, which would allow them to stock up on best buy's entire supply as expected. Bestbuy finds a way out of it. Why not? They're not a competitor. Of course, at the same time that Nathan is trying to use best buy system to his advantage, he and the small store owner, I'm going to even more elaborate and absurd lengths to game their own customers,

Speaker 4:          07:23          printing out some flyers and distributing them throughout the neighborhood. It was finally time for Alan to offer his $1 prices to the world,

Speaker 1:          07:31          obscuring their $1 TV's with a black tie dress code and alive allocator. After a failed ball suit and a staged reality show, we ultimately hear the message loud and clear. The international corporations can design rules that plunge small businesses into financial ruin.

Speaker 4:          07:48          I'm just so sick and tired of these big companies like best buy and Ron thinking that you know the rules don't apply to them,

Speaker 1:          07:55          not content to suggest that the hyper competitive business climate robs us of our morality and doomed to failure. The show also explores the uncomfortable relationship between modern business objectives and mortality. To understand why this matters, we have to examine the ideas of Pulitzer prize winning. Social Theorist Ernest Becker, who saw the motivations behind our desire to acquire money as simply put, are futile efforts to escape death as he wrote in his book, escape from evil money can be accumulated and passed on and so radiates its powers even after one's death, giving one a semblance of immortality. Nathan explores this relationship in several of his episodes taking the logic of acquisition and the narcissism implicit in it and the plaza to the most more bit of possible causes of funeral industry. In one episode, he convinced us a funeral home to offer a service in which the unpopular dead can hire actors to attend their funerals so that they appear to be well liked. This is the ridiculous albion logical extension of a consumer's world in which we amassed objects and instagram likes in order to feel hip, cool and validated, but there's more in other episodes. Nathan explores the uncomfortable aspects of monetizing the death. He convinces a travel agent who only has very elderly customers to start offering funeral services to squeeze those customers for every cent before they quote. He takes a very familiar logic, diversifying your business, and it makes it incredibly eerie by literally capitalizing off deaths.

Speaker 4:          09:31          This is a last ditch effort to squeeze out as much as you can from your customers before they're gone for good.

Speaker 1:          09:37          By applying a pretty banal business concept to the most ghoulish of circumstances, Nathan exposes the inherit culturism. Sometimes implicit in trying to upsell your customers towards the end, it makes an attempt to save on the overhead costs of cremations by testing out the idea of using a wood fire pizza oven instead of a crematorium.

Speaker 4:          09:56          A few more hours. Would it all just burned to a crisp? Yeah. Would that work the same for a human body?

Speaker 1:          10:02          At the same time, there's actually a really strange hopefulness. Insincerity to Nathan for you. Think about it. This is one of the very few reality shows in which the people depicted typically don't come across as crazy narcissistic jerks. They're actually, for the most part, pretty sympathetic to show will often stall on strange moments of humanity even if it's somewhat disturbing like the gas station owners propensity for drinking his grandson's urine.

Speaker 4:          10:28          Bye. I'm promoting because the ground grandsons peer sometimes help or these sexually experimental brothers, so you guys are brothers

Speaker 1:          10:36          and you guys will have sex with the same girl or the extremely ghost where a realtor would choked in Switzerland talking about earlier, we are shocked by was by an entity. Other times these displays of humanity are just really genuine. Going to be okay. The show highlights the tension between those slivers of humanity and the mandates of our modern economy. For instance, in one scheme, Nathan sets his production assistant Solomon up on a date, but agrees to have it sponsored by Quiznos, so a quiznos rep is brought on standby to deliver branded dialogue in real time for Solomon to say him say toasty. Toasty. This is a very self reflexive critique of the television industry as a whole, which at the end of the day, only makes money by padding it's gripping human dramas and comedies with commercial breaks every 10 or so minutes. Furthermore, if the show asks in a world over saturated with advertising, how can we hope for a true connection? It shows best through line. Explores this question by depicting Nathan's ongoing quest to find love and friendship. Whether Nathan's forcing auditioning actress to say, I love you, I love you again.

Speaker 4:          11:55          I love you

Speaker 1:          11:56          for asking a shopkeeper if he'd like to hang out to be rejected.

Speaker 4:          12:00          Would you ever want to hang out sometimes socially with me outside of this?

Speaker 1:          12:04          No. Nathan's antics are hilarious because they're perfectly calibrated to turn people off. He's the king of inopportunity hugs and misguided attempts at small talk.

Speaker 4:          12:15          If it makes it a little bit safer, um, would you be comfortable just being handcuffed,

Speaker 1:          12:20          listen, enjoys letting his genuine vulnerabilities take center stage. This is never more true than when Nathan treats himself like a struggling business

Speaker 4:          12:28          and I know that as a TV host, having a personality that people don't like is bad for business, and that's why I needed to make a change.

Speaker 1:          12:36          Scheming to improve is desirability. As a friend and lover, he paints himself as the hunk on a meetup dating show. He also conducts a focus group to improve his likability. I think v-neck would go well with you, have been brilliant and stages and elaborate scientific experiment to improve that. Hanging out with him is fun.

Speaker 4:          12:55          So if their serotonin or dopamine levels go up when they're hanging out with me, that would mean that I'm fun

Speaker 1:          13:02          in treating human interaction like a business. Nathan embodies the loneliness and isolation of our modern world. At other times, Nathan actually offers an answer with strange moments of genuine human connectedness throughout the series, solidarity forms amongst a troop of rebates seekers who camp out with Nathan on the mountain,

Speaker 4:          13:19          we agree with you. The friendship that we gained here is just incredible, so let's go down the mountain, and

Speaker 1:          13:25          an oddly compelling relationship develops between Nathan antibodies, most lovable sex worker facing happy birthday. He's interactions are always mediated by money. On some level, the rebate seekers are waiting for Nathan to get them their rebates and macy as being paid handsomely to hang out with him, but glimmers of true curiosity, affection and shared humanity shine through and it's really beautiful to watch. It's adjusted. Human connectedness is the bomb that can make the current conditions of the modern world terrible. Sometimes. Nathan literalize is this thesis by sending the subjects of this failed schemes up on dates, suggesting that there's economic situations could be bearable if only they had love and conclusion. Nathan for you is a giant smirk holding a sign that says, please love me. It explores all the cynical motivations that govern us in dys, ruthless era of startups and branded everything and hey, at the end of the day, maybe hanging out with the right group of Weirdos could be just the antidote.
