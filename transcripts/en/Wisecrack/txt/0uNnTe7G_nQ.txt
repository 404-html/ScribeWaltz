Speaker 1:          00:00          Mm.

Speaker 1:          00:06          Diversity is a pretty new term. Very grateful for it. It, it gets to something that is absolutely real and has been harder to discuss before it existed. That said, I'm not sure I have a perfect definition. It recognizes the fact that we are not singular, that we are not all identical, that we have a variation of, of brands, of connectivity, of aptitudes, of weaknesses, of blind spots and of sensitivities and of capabilities. People on the autism spectrum who are, who are very functional, uh, in my experience, tend to have extraordinary analytical skills and also often actually insight into social interactions. So long as they're not the ones participating. Uh, and so you have an eye. I've had a number of autistic students actually point out to me dynamics that were emerging in classrooms that I hadn't yet seen. And that once they were pointed out, I could see a, and these are the same students who have a very hard time.

Speaker 1:          01:13          You're recognizing when it is or is not time to speak or get up or walk through the middle of the classroom and such. There are a number of ways to be neurodiverse. We have names for some conditions that actually represent, uh, ends of continuum. Dyslexia is, is a big one. Um, these are going to sound like they're coming out of left field, but colorblindness left handedness in each of those cases being what in evolutionary biology we call the non dominant phenotype. So I'm, I'm a, I'm a lefty. That's, that's the one of those that I belong to as a group. And about 10% of people across all cultures that have been studied are lefthanded. It's a persistent, stable, rare phenotype, which suggests that it's adaptive, that it's persistent, it's complex and it is, it provides the different wiring of the brain associated with being a lefthander, uh, provides benefit in the social group in which lefthander show up.

Speaker 1:          02:19          We can put together analyses for why being a lefthander might allow you to approach a physical problem differently. That a right hander would have a harder time solving, but the different wiring of the brain allows for different approaches as well. Similar with colorblindness, that it might be really easy to say, well, okay, that just is going to give you some, some ability to see past color and to see patterns that aren't color-based perhaps. But I suspect that there's wiring in the brain that is associated with colorblindness that also allows for enhanced abilities that are different from those who are colors cited. Dyslexia for sure. Right? Dyslexia is obviously a very modern condition because writing is a very modern condition. So as an evolutionary biologist, when I say modern, I mean thousands of years. Um, so dyslexia is modern in terms of thousands of years. And um, you know, language was always about sound and never about writing until recently. And so the, the lesson, the ability, it's almost never an inability, but the lesson, the ability to process written symbols into meaning in your head looks to me like it's in trade off relationship with the ability to engage in real time in speech. And that's not to say that all of us can't learn through practice to be better at any number of these skills, but that being born with what the world has is calling a deficit is almost always going to exist in trade off relationship with some often hidden strength. Strength.

Speaker 2:          03:57          Yeah.
