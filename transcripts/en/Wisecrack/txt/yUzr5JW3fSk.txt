Speaker 1:          00:00          This video is brought to you by skill share. What's up wise? Crack Jared again. Now you would think that after almost 20 years of some of the most intense fan hatred ever,

Speaker 2:          00:14          thumbs way down, you didn't like, no, I think I deserve a public apology from George Lucas.

Speaker 1:          00:20          There'd be nothing new to say about the worst star war, the phantom menace. And yet here we are. After the release of return of the Jedi. In 1983 millions of fans begged George Lucas to create a new star wars film. Studio executives begged him, toy makers, begged him and after constantly saying no. Finally in 1999 everyone got their wish. George Lucas released the phantom menace. Problem solved except not really upon release. Star Wars fans rose up in fury and demanded the head of George Lucas on a tuscan spike. They rallied together and aol chat rooms and Yahoo message boards. And for the first time in these short history of the Internet, fans from across the world banded together in the righteous cause of tearing George Lucas a new one for the unforgivable sin that was making this movie. And hey look, they had a point. The phantom menace, for lack of better word, sucks.

Speaker 1:          01:13          Hundreds of articles, essays and videos have been written about how it sucks shadow Mr Plink it. So you don't mind. I like the characters. Know what you're stupid and why it sucks. So much so that it has become a given that there's absolutely nothing redeemable about this movie. But what if that's not entirely true? Relax. I'm not going to argue that many chlorines were a great idea. It is possible he was conceived. Instead of want to talk about what the phantom menace gets almost right. Because conceptually there are some very promising themes at play here. Namely Nazis. It's no secret that the original trilogy largely wanted you to conflate the empire with the third, right from the costumes to the use of color. And of course naming the soldiers storm troopers. But how did the galaxy get to be this way? Like Nazi Germany, which descended into totalitarianism through democratic means, George Lucas aspired to portray something immensely important with the prequels.

Speaker 1:          02:11          How a peaceful republic can democratically descend into full blown nazi-ism. So what went wrong? Well, let's find out. Welcome to this wisecrack condition on star wars. Episode one, the Phantom Menace. What went wrong? And uh, can you spoil the movie with no plot? Oh, and if you want to hear us nerd out about the Disney star wars backlash, check out our special episode on our movie podcast. Show me the meaning. You will smash that link in the description for everyone who hasn't seen this in over a decade. Here's a brief recap and organization called the Trade Federation is protesting trade taxes by blockading trade with the planet and the Boob. But I guess it doesn't have to make sense because really they're doing it all for their boy. Darth Sidious, Aka Senator Palpatine. There are public, a certain quiet gone gin and his apprentice. Oh, we Kenobi to negotiate, but the trade federation tries to kill them.

Speaker 1:          03:03          They flee to the surface of Nibu, which is now being invaded by the trade federation and counter the worst character ever conceived in cinematic history. Save the Queen and try to zoom off to the Galactic Senate where they can explain what a bunch of jerks the trade federation is. But they get shot up and at the find supplies on tattooing where they meet a nice slave boy with incredible force blood. There are some like gambling. They liberate the boy, leave his mother to rot and head to the Senate to plead their case. There's a battle quite gone dies or we won murders. Darth Maul and Palpatine is now the head Honcho of the Galactic Senate. Also, jar jar is a general, the original trilogy, while wonderfully enjoyable are not complex works of emotional art and they're not intended to be. There are updates of the flash gordon buck Rogers cereals from Lucas's childhood. The heroes were good men who often were white and the villains were evil men who often wore black just like luke skywalker and darth vader. There's no ambiguity here and that's okay. The phantom menace on the other hand is quite ambiguous, quite gone, lies in cheats his way through most of the story. He as per the light side of the forest, quietly meditates before his final confrontation against Darth Maul and gets wrecked.

Speaker 1:          04:21          Obiwan fills with rage and emotion associated with the dark side. And only then can he effectively avenge his master, not quite the black and white morality of the first three films, but most notable is our benevolent heroin Queen Ahmed Dolla. She spends the phantom menace trying to save her people, but for all her noble intentions, she mostly gets manipulated by senator palpatine and even proves integral in getting him elected supreme chancellor. When good leads to victory for evil, we've entered the realm of the morally ambiguous in his essay art and moral education philosopher Christopher Hamilton expounds on the richness of such moral ambiguity in so much as they force us to confront our own moral beliefs. It's a sign of great art. So did the phantom menace give us that gut punch that comes with us reevaluating our own moral beliefs? Of course it did. Right, right. Okay.

Speaker 1:          05:14          Just kidding. I felt nothing all 20 times I've seen this movie. Ambiguity is a great idea when dealing with complex issues like political systems, trade federation, planetary autonomy, solving humanitarian crises. So why didn't it work? Because the characters have no agency. Author. Chuck Wendig, who has written extensively on the subject defines agency and fiction as a demonstration of the characters ability to make decisions and affect the story. They have motivations all their own. They are active more than they are reactive. They push the plot more than the plot pushes on them and contrast. He writes that characters without agency tend to be like little paper boats bobbing down a river of your own making. They cannot steer. They cannot change the course of the river. The river is an external force that carries them along, meaning the plastics, his hand up the characters cavernous bottom hole and makes the character do things and say things in service to the plot in the phantom menace.

Speaker 1:          06:13          It's almost like Lucas took this rule of bad writing and ran with it quite gone and Anagen and Pat May and Obi wan and God helped me judge. Our banks aren't nothing but little paper boats. They have no internal conflict, no external life, no personal obsession outside of what the film dictates and that river pushing them along. And I'll, as we later learn, it's the dark side. It does everything possible to see the future and the biggest casualty besides the time you and I just wasted being bored is the political message itself. The best example of this is the story of Queen Amidala Pad May, along with many of the other characters are mere ponds of palpatine. That's not necessarily a bad thing, but as we'll see, palpatine's manipulations quickly turned into how to cover up bad writing one on one. Here's what we know about pat mate. She's a queen who doesn't want to submit to some invader because, well, that's what Queens do. Just a likes democracy because hey, she's not evil. So in Star Wars, how does a queen who likes democracy lead to the eventual downfall of said democracy? She gets manipulated. Palpatine creates a crisis on the Bu, which mirrors the prototypical false flag attack of the Reichstag fire. And she has to plead to the Senate to intervene. But palpatine's since he's smart, knows their feckless bureaucrats and will do nothing. He plants a seed in dollars. Mind,

Speaker 3:          07:39          I must be frank. I mean, I just hate that isn't it'll chance to send it to will act on the Indonesian.

Speaker 1:          07:44          She sees his warning come true.

Speaker 3:          07:46          This is Brad Thompson. Pint is conceited when you defer your motion to allow a commission to explore the validity of your accusations

Speaker 1:          07:59          calls for the supreme chancellor to be ousted

Speaker 3:          08:02          and is the village of no confidence and child suffer Lauren's leadership

Speaker 1:          08:06          so that a real statesman can take charge and cut through the bureaucratic red tape that real estate's been just happens to be our ambitious senator and future Emperor Xiv. Palpatine Aka darth sidious. Here's where our paper boats become a problem. Characters without agency are well boring. But in this case of trying to get into the complexity of not only how democracy's fail, but how well meaning people are implicated, paper wrote characters rob us of our ability to reflect on what's actually happening. Beat for beat. It makes sense. Palpatine warrants or of something. She sees his warning come true, so she falls for the deception and even sounds good, but maybe because Lucas was too busy cramming in 8,000 dumb lines for this guy, it falls flat. Each beat could have confronted our character with a choice they might deliberate over with or at least talk about this choice.

Speaker 1:          08:57          She might argue with Palpatine, she might confide in a friend, she might reach out to an outside government for help. She might deny palpatine's bargain at all costs and Toba toll on her citizenry gets too high, but in the phantom menace, things just kind of happen because everyone is a pawn, not a person with agency, and that destroys our ability as the audience to reflect on these issues. When we identify with the characters we identify would their dilemma asking ourselves, what would I do when in the dark knight, the joker rigs to boats with explosives to give each one the power to obliterate the other before they get obliterated themselves.

Speaker 3:          09:34          Midnight, I blow you all alone, however, presses the button. I'll let that though.

Speaker 1:          09:41          We bite our nails as we debate the merits of killing someone else to save our own skin. There's no such tension in the phantom menace because pat may is just palpatine's puppet. And what's the deal with the other senators? What are their motivations? Who knows? We're just hold when and how they side with palpatine. And to make matters worse, at no point does pad may regret the decision that would eventually destroyed democracy in the phantom menace or in the later movies. If her initial decision to remove the supreme chancellor from power gives us no room to empathize and think. At least we can empathize and think about her regret. But no for a woman who later says this,

Speaker 4:          10:19          so this is how it appears. He dies and their supplies,

Speaker 1:          10:24          you might at least expect her to sob quietly in some corner because she literally made this happen. By contrast, consider Jamie lannister from game of thrones. He was a loyal guard to the mad king. Zapped when the mad king tried to incinerate all of his citizens. Jamie broke his sacred oath and murdered the person he swore to protect.

Speaker 3:          10:44          Then the king drove my soldiers back.

Speaker 1:          10:50          Jamie is haunted by this decision as he's derisively called Kinsler for the rest of his life and while he probably made the right choice, he's also acutely aware that he is more or less responsible for the current show in Westeros. He takes responsibility for the choices he made and that allows us to identify with him or we can even look at rogue one where a good characters involvement in the creation of the death star is put front and center. Not only does this lack of agency rob meaning from the how democracy dies theme in the phantom menace, but it also makes all of Lucas's topical and timely takes on news of the decade, more or less meaningless. The phantom menace came out in the late nineties just years after governments in Bosnia and Rwanda had committed genocide. So when the queen of Nobu is pleading to an international, I mean interplanetary government body to intervene in the slaughter for people.

Speaker 1:          11:42          George Lucas inspiration was pretty obvious on a narrative level. Do we care? Not really vague shout outs to current events. Don't a good political allegory make you need choices. Instead, we understand it as just another step in Palpatine's greater machinations. When the Senate fails to do anything, we don't understand their motivations for doing so or their personal failings aside from a line or two from palpatine describing them as an effectual. And then there's the trade federation talk of taxes and trade in the opening crawl was likely meant to invoke contemporary debates about globalization and free trade, right on the heels of Nafta, which was passed in 1994 and anti globalization protests. So what does the Trade Federation want? Why did the Senate passed taxes on trade? Who The f knows? It's also worth noting that aside from the political themes, characters getting pushed along the narrative stream with no choice is everywhere. In the case of George, our heat literally succeeds via incompetence in the battle of Nobu, his fumbling and carelessness accidentally release whatever these are, which destroy a bunch of enemy droids. I think this must be what business people mean by failing up. And then there's Anagen who pushes a bunch of wrong buttons, which very him to the droid ship where he can press a few more buttons to save the day.

Speaker 4:          12:56          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          12:59          What if this is the real curse of the phantom menace because it could have been a powerful movie. More importantly, it could have been a powerful children's movie and join the likes of Harry Potter as kid fictions covering horrific political history, but it's not, not even close. Just mark it down as another example of grandiose ambitions ending and a face plant. Indeed, there are few things more painful than missing the mark on projects you pour your life and soul into.
