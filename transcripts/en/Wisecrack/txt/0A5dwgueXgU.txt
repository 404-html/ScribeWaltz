Speaker 1:          00:05          Well,

Speaker 2:          00:07          I mean, just justice for me. I mean, one of the reasons I love Shakespeare is that justice, you know, I could say back to you at that level of abstraction will justice is about fundamental fairness. Justice is about equality, know among people who are similarly situated, justices about due process of law. But I think precisely why I'm driven to Shakespeare is because I don't think the conversation really helps anybody at that level of generality. So we really need to think about particular stories in particular case studies in particular mythologies. And one of the regrets that I have about, uh, the otherwise wonderful nature of the, of American diversity is that our heterogeneity means that we have very few common mythologies left to us. So what I'm trying to do, and Shakespeare is to try and say in the same way that I would say to a law school class about a case, but I want to make this more available to people who haven't gone to law school and don't want to go to law school.

Speaker 2:          01:04          You know, let's read the merchant, read the merchant of Venice to me with together with me against measure for measure. You know, and the merchant of Venice is really about a law that a society that takes law too seriously, like takes a letter of the law too seriously, which is to say, Charlotte says, I want my pound of flesh. You know, and the court of Venice is open to all comers. It's a cosmopolitan society. It's a market society. So it interprets that contract really strictly. And in fact, this is in the play, which is to say because this is a market open to all comers, people would lose faith in the law if we didn't interpret all contracts really strictly. And so therefore sharla because entitled to Antonio's pound of flesh and nobody wants to live in that society, right? On the other hand, it can't be that when portia says the quality of mercy is not strained to drop the pith of gentle rain from having upon the place beneath and she has this great encomium to mercy, that mercy is what it's all about and that all we need as an answer to this is to be merciful to each other because what real mercy would mean would really be something that would strike at the very heart of law.

Speaker 2:          02:08          And that's measure for measure. The Duke at the beginning of measure for measure, just so people know, since this is a less familiar play, he's a duke of Vienna. He has law, the law fall into utter disrepair. So he just hasn't enforced the law and so lawlessness is sweeping the land. Then my favorite line is the baby beats a nurse like this is a world out of joint. You know, hierarchy has been disrupted and so he essentially leaves and leaves the leaves, a really strict a deputy and as place to enforce the law, but the deputy himself ends up violating a law and then the dude comes in and restores order. But at the very end. But Duke like issues all these pardons to everybody who's broken the law all over again. So at the end of the play, or we're no better off than we were at the beginning.

Speaker 2:          02:50          So both the merchant and metric or measure or describe worlds to us in which neither of us would want to live that no, no one would want to live in. Because you know, the merchant of Venice doesn't have enough mercy measure for measure has too much marcy and no law. So what is the answer to that? I don't think that there's any easy answer that says, you know, I'm going to titrate, you know, mercy and, and the letter of the law if such a way that we're going to have the perfect balance and it's like, ah, you know, two to one ratio of letter of the law to mercy. Like that's never going to be the case. It's going to hatch that actually be on the ground and with contacts. But I think that looking at our common mythologies, it's going to help us understand that and the reason that we have these stories so that we understand that as justice Oliver Wendell Holmes on sad and you know, the life of the law is not logic.

Speaker 2:          03:38          It's experience and it's experience of these stories. It's a fine grained every day, you know, muddy, murky, you know, uh, a nature of, of life itself that we somehow have to make sense of. And the answer is not going to be, well, we should have the strict letter of the law, or we should have, you know, overflowing mercy. Because neither of those is going to end up in a society in which we want to live. But I'm trying to find that middle space. We're not going to be able to do that through any kind of scientific formula. It's not an algorithm. It's not Algebra. We're going to actually have to talk about culture. And that's what I'm trying to do.
