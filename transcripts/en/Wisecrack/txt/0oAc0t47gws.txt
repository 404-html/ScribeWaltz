Speaker 1:          00:10          The more recent finding is this pure fat, uh, where were we? You know, we did a study where we had people come into the lab, um, to take a battery of risk taking and decision making measures on a computer. And we asked him to come and bring two friends with them and then we randomly assigned them to either do these tasks by themselves, um, or to do it with their friends, watching them. Uh, and we had teenagers, college undergraduate sent adults, you know, 30 or so years old. And so what we found in this study was that the mere presence of peers doubled the number of risks that adolescents took. It had a 50% increase among college students and no effect at all among adults. Now, uh, this was really interesting to me. Nobody had shown this experimentally before. Let's consistent with the idea that most adolescent risk taking occurs when they're in groups and with their friends.

Speaker 1:          01:01          So we've, we just recently, uh, my colleague Jason [inaudible], who is a neuroscientist and I just recently took this experiment into the Ri. So we have this subjects, uh, with their brains being scanned. And they're lying down in the magnet at the computer screen is in there that can do the tasks, the same task. We haven't come with two friends, their friends are in the next room. Their friends can see their performance on a monitor that's in the next room and their friends are miked into the magnet. So, uh, on cue when we tell the friends, they say, okay Dave, I'm watching you now. All right. Um, and we compare people's performance on these tasks when they know their friends are watching them and when they know their friends can't see them at all. So they're not even in the same room with them. They just are aware of their presence.

Speaker 1:          01:47          I mean, they're not encouraging them to take risks or anything like that cause we script what they're allowed to say. And we've just discovered in the process of writing this up right now to send out to the journal that the presence of peers activates the brain systems that are in this reward circuit that we've been talking about in kids. But it doesn't in adults. And so we think that the reason that we saw the pure fact is that when you are with your friends, when you were a teenager, it increases the salience of the rewarding aspects of a risky decision, which then of course there's going to make you pursued the risky decision rather than be risk averse. So we're really excited about this finding. Um, and uh, we, we, we, I was just working on a paper this morning in which we looked at, um, the impact of the presence of friends on People's preferences for immediate versus delayed rewards.

Speaker 1:          02:47          And we were just doing this in the skin are now, but in, in our behavioral research, we see the same thing. So we have a sample of 19 year olds and they, they do this task, it's called the delay discounting task where basically measures how much you'd be, how much less of a reward you'd be willing to take to get it now rather than waiting. Okay. Um, when the 19 year olds do this with their friends watching them, they make decisions that are comparable to what 14 year olds make. Um, but when 19 year olds do it with their friends, not watching them, they behave like adults. And so again, it's this impact of peers on reward processing that seems to be going on, that may play a role in understanding risk taking. So, uh, when, when we first saw it, you, you, you asked what gets me excited? You know, when we first saw these brain scans, we couldn't believe it because it looked too beautiful to be true. And we peaked, you know, kind of early on, we'd only run, you know, a couple dozen subjects and now we've done the whole experiment. And, um, it's, it's just amazing. It's, it, it has held up. So we're really, really jazzed about this.
