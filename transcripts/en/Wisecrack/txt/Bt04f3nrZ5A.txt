I thought it was hairy it on a rag, but he like, oh that bitch only talked to her cause she tells you what to do and metallic boy Harry, it all told about l not one hers, but she beats through the pain and head off to visit some homies called the basises.

Speaker 1:          02:16          Turns out there's a new gal on the block. The bates is his knees, Jane Fairfax. Now Jane is foxy smart ag of buster sick flow on the piano forte. Emma is used to being the bad bitch bits on the block so she getting all turned that everybody digging Jane's game instead of hires specially says Jane ain't got the facts. Fact facts are the rap sheet got so Mr Western son Frank Churchill drop in and start chopping it up with him or I did some good laughs. Frank got a bounce cause it's id sick but from the lungs of it rather than might be getting suite on Emma. Emma like Nah he probably better for Harry. Meanwhile Mr. Allen ended up getting heads to some rich hot seat that k nobody staying later. Frank come back to town but Emma puts his ass in the friend zone. They decided to hit the club anyway and what Harry Rolling Solo on the dance floor nightly step up this dog freaking on it a few days later.

Speaker 1:          03:15          Harrier says she's moved on from Allen the song one way flight. Emma. Thank it's that cat frank, since he got her back when she was getting mad dog by crew of Gypsies couple of days ago. Thank goodness over the next two days. Frank Star, dirty Mac and Emma in front of the whole hood. Damn Frank. That ain't nice dog nightly. Say he going to skip town for a few days but before he leaves he looked like he about the kids in Emma's hand but he pulled out at the last second. I know that move Emma still gig that he thought about it though next day phrase and it takes that long dirt now some now amma thinking he could stop the bus and get what? Harriet but then break Yo south. Emma get worried that Jane and Frank got engaged on the loud. Loud. What? What about Harry, you and this Gibran Brawny been smooth talking me.

Speaker 1:          04:08          Why thieves in gaze? Aw Hell Nah. When news come to Harriet, she all like girl, I ain't in the bitch ass. Chomps like frank. Anyway, I got this other dude I don't like hold up girl. You're talking about nightly damn straight. I'm going to start bugging hard cause she started realizing that she want to be when nightly now emma thinking she should have never taken area out of the hood. So nightly come by. Emma thinking he probably Gone Jab on about Harry his booty but surprise bitch nightly say he loved Mary. Emma like that girl, you're lost her goddamn mine. Nightly proposes and Emma saying Hell Yeah player put a ring on it. I mean yeah this one, this one and my son Harry and a lot of sand, sorry girl nightly his mom man now but later she find out Harry, you're going to marry that farmer boy and Robert Martin. Anyway so she ended up getting her freak nasty on tilt. So both couples getting married and it's all good in the hood,

Speaker 1:          05:16          like all fresh jams laid down. But my girl Jane Austin, this tax got an ass load to say about women and society back in the day. Emma's a choice example of what an empowered woman or the time looks like. Whereas most gals had to rely on men. Fair thing. Emma don't need nothing from nobody. She got the money and the power to control her own life, both in the crib and in the hood. Sound's all good, right? Set that control ain't all it's cracked up to be. Matter of fact, it just turns her into a miserable haven. The real evils indeed of Emma situation where the power of having rather too much her own way and the disposition to think a little too allover itself. These were the disadvantages which threatened to Lloyd's or her many enjoyments. The danger however was that presence so on proceed that they did not by any means grandkids misfortunes with her.

Speaker 1:          06:11          Funny thing is Miley always telling him what that is, the duty of fat cats to look out for the pope folk since they the leaders of the hood, but like my girl Jane Austin, do she just slang an irony up in here, cause money show is held on make people act right towards anybody. Now check I that fuck boy out and sugar mama. She just came up in the game and got paid but still be acting like a fool. Always acting nasty and saying stupid shit in front of everybody. That new money show didn't give her no class, but even without slow pockets, people still acting out. Elton thank he can get with Emma, but say Harry, you're too much of a hood rat and married, so it's good for him or the slum it with you, but you too. Good for Harriet. Fuck that player.

Speaker 1:          06:56          Truth is Austin Hayden or anyone who obsessed with rank or status, no matter what your money looked like, but she throw the most Ceda Emma who spent her time thinking that people got to stay in that place and anybody who tried to better themselves, it's just clowning. Just check out what she's saying. When Elton tried to put a ring on it, he must know that unfortunate consequence. She was greatly his superior. He must know that the one houses had been sat up for several generations at Hartfield. The younger brands have a very ancient family and that the alums were nobody for Emma, such a hater. How can they read a tolerate her stank ass? Well, that's when my girl Jane austen's pro writing skills come into play. She slanging this technique called free indirect discourse. Basically, the narration is highly close to Emma's thoughts, but it also includes some outside commentary, Latin, a step back from her wack ass perspective so the audience can follow her motivations but not how to deal with the shallow bulls.

Speaker 1:          07:55          I put her down, you feel me? Thank goodness though Austin don't use free and direct discourse. What the more righteous characters like Miss Westin and nightly since miss w and k money too legit to quit. Austin just let their words speak for themselves. This is only one emma learn that Harriet is going to marry the farmer boy that she recognize all this social status job don't mean nothing. You can get rich like Mrs Elton and still act like a chump are. You can be a low level hustling like Robert Martin and still be classy. Even if you got humble beginnings like Mr Weston High Society going to treat you right. If you act real, if you show respect, you're going to get respect straight up. It don't matter if you got cash or streets certified status, it's all how you act. That's going to get you where you going.

Speaker 1:          08:45          No matter where your family come from or how much you got in the bank. You should always focus on how you treat people. And if being on the social come up is the only thing on your mind, then you best shot yourself son. Cause you looking in the wrong places y'all. That shit ain't gonna make you a better person.
