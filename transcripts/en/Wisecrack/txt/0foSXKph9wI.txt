Speaker 1:          00:05          I think it's indivisible, surely die, then you've got it, or you have. And every diminution of freedom of speech diminishes everyone and, uh, lessens the currency of freedom of speech. But I, I feel nothing better. Nice when it's done lightly. It has to be a controversial statement, has to be earned. It can't just be tossed off. You have to be able to, you know, back it up. And so I would, I would, I would urge, you know, civilized standards of moderation on both sides. It has to be understood that freedom of speech isn't justice at a decadent frippery that we, that we gather around us like all our other comforts and privileges. Democracy can't work without freedom of speech. It's an absolute cornerstone of democracy. So we have to be very responsible about this freedom, but there's no giving it up. Well, modifying it. Eaton, I would say it's a, it's an offshoot of what solidified on the political correctness.

Speaker 1:          01:26          And, um, I'm a fan of political correctness. No one ever says I will. I'm very politically politically correct, but in fact it's good that we are, uh, not, not the outer fringe pc, that and raising the standards about what can be said and, uh, an exclusion was things you could have said and got away with it a 10 or 20 years ago and now seems discordant and you know, who wants to go back to being opposed to gay marriage. I mean, the ease with which that became the orthodoxy was I thought tremendously encouraging. Um, and the idea that Donald Trump has cost off the shackles and we go back to being brutes again, um, is a, is a terrible prospects pc. His has been an agent for certain sort of evolutionary acceleration, uh, in, towards progressive ideas. And I can't. I think that's been very good. I mean, when I look back at my very early fiction of 40 odd years ago, I'm, I'm shocked and made uneasy by some of the liberties I took that I have set and he wouldn't take no. Um, it, it doesn't interfere with the freedom of writers, political correctness. It gives you challenges every now and then you'd have to sort of work grounded a bit, but I never resent that. And I think it's, it's, um, self improvement on a general scale that we've all responded to.
