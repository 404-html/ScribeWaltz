Speaker 1:          00:02          Hey, wise, crack, fleshy, jared again, and today we're breaking down season three, episode nine of Rick and Morty, the abcs of Beth. This episode is one of my favorites, not only because it develops Beth in some interesting ways, but because it builds on a theme from way back in another season. Three favorite pick on that idea, the importance of choice. Welcome this wise crack quick take on the abcs of Beth. First, a quick recap. The father of Beth's adolescent friend, Tommy. It's about to be put to death for eating. His son that's soon realizes her childhood fantasy of fruit. De Leon was not some mechanism to cope with her friend's death, but a very real place built by rick to keep her sociopathic tendencies out of his way. Also, Tommy has built a kingdom on incest and cannibalism. I suppose you're wondering, how do I sustain myself?

Speaker 1:          00:54          Oh boy, we aren't. Meanwhile, Jerry has a new alien girlfriend, Kiarra and things are moving fast. Does your planet have shorter days because you guys are moving kind of fast? No, Jerry decides to break up with her, but isn't able to take responsibility for his decision and blames his kid after kid tries to murder morning in summer for allegedly causing the breakup. Jerry finally owns up to his actions in the abcs of Beth, the A and b plots parallel each other. We have Beth Cherry and even greg unwilling to take responsibility for their choices. Beth refuses to acknowledge sentencing Tommy to a life of humping teletubby. Tommy, I'm sorry. You think you deserve an apology. And Rick Denies Building for Upi land to avoid being emotionally available to his daughter. I'm sorry. You think you deserve an apology? Whereas Jerry refuses to take responsibility for ending his toxic relationship with Kiarra. So what does all this have to do with pickle rick? Well, this

Speaker 2:          01:51          and I think it's because the only truly unapproachable concept for you is that it's your mind within your control. You chose to come here. You chose to talk to belittle my vocation just as you chose to become a pickle. Each of us gets to choose.

Speaker 1:          02:06          As we've mentioned before, this season is playing a lot with the ideas of agency freedom and most importantly choice as Dr Wong noted in brick managing the stone. Morty is angry at his father for having no agency standing in the driveway. Talking about company can either tell her you want to stay married or get on with your life, but whatever you do, stop being a baby in pickle. Rick. Rick literally gives up his freedom by becoming a pickle and elaborate ruse to avoid therapy in the Rick Landis mixup. We see what happens when ricks give up their freedom and of course in the world early conspiracy. One of my favorite moments in the season is this advice to jerry, but there comes a time in every man's life when he must choose the foundation on which his legacy will be built. What of compromise one of blood in our pickle.

Speaker 1:          02:59          Quick take. We talked about how some of the ideas represented their mirror. John Paul Sartre, idea of bad faith for a very quick refresher. Bad faith is when we negate the radical freedom we are afforded in our ability to make choices. In a sense, we choose not to choose after she realizes she's no different than God. I'm my father. Beth has an identity crisis to head. I'm out of excuses to not be who I am. So who am I? What do I do? So how do to Sanchez is cursed with intelligence, find meaning and an uncaring world. Am I evil? Worse? You're smart when you know nothing matters. The Universe is yours and I've never met a universe that was into it. Rick's conversation reflects on some upstarts points for sorry. The whole problem of our existence starts with the fact that there is no inherent meaning and departing from Sarta bit.

Speaker 1:          03:50          Any attempt to draw meaning from the universe will be met with cosmic indifference. You know, smart people get a chance to climb on top, take reality for a ride, but it'll never stop trying to throw you and eventually it will. There's no other way off for rick. Those smart enough get to take reality for a ride before they too are inevitably thrown off. Or in other words, they can indulge in whatever they desire, but when reality catches up with them, well, we've seen it before with rick best feels trapped by her family and her arguably ironic attachment to abc, to bachelor's. She readily denies her own freedom and thus the choices available to her with the facts of her existence can't do that. The kids, jerry my job and as much as I hate to admit it, ABC's the Bachelor Rick Solution isn't to free her necessarily, but to give her a choice can make a clone of you a perfect instance of view with all your memories and exact copy in every way and 11, provide for the kids.

Speaker 1:          04:44          Do your job and consume broadcast network reality TV on the same allegedly ironic level as you. You could be gone a day, a week or the rest of your life with zero consequences. The moment you decided to come back, I flipped a switch and the clumps job is done. It feels no pain, regrets nothing, and has zero chance of going blade runner. The important thing here is rick doesn't argue that she should do this, but says then stay and luxuriate in a life you can finally know you've chosen my secret bonuses, that no matter what you choose, you're finally going to chill the fuck out. In other words, it's not whether she takes rick up on the clone or not, but the fact that she makes a choice that matters. The prospect of the clone confronts Beth with her absolute freedom and just by putting her in this crossroads, rick is prompting her to choose her identity.

Speaker 1:          05:30          So no matter what she chooses, the choice brings resolved or her identity crisis. So maybe Rick has learned something from Dr Wong afterall. We can split hairs on reddit forums for hours on whether or not Beth decided to take rick's offer, but it doesn't really matter whether or not Beth abandoned her family. It's the fact that she chose that will ultimately help her find meaning. So what about evil? Jerry? He claims he is an evil but just a tower. Meanwhile, rick tells Beth, she's not evil, just smart, but are we to believe rick or is this for intelligence used to justify sickness? To quote Dr Wall after all, Rick built a magical play place for his sociopathic child just to avoid dealing with her inherited problems.
