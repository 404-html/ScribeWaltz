Speaker 1:          00:02          Well ebooks or another method of taxed delivery. Uh, and I did run a, I ran a blog on the subject sometime ago and it was called three reasons for keeping paper books and the three reasons were uh, solar flares, which would wipe out communications towers and not so well any electronic media that you might happen to have a stored, um, grand overload resulting in brownouts which would have similar effects and internet overload and less people are going to build the grid out more and to build the net out more. And there's pretty soon not going to be very much based on it because of all the spam and torn, um, to the, to the percentage of 95 I'm told. So it was very crowded there. So building out the nat, building up the grid and what are you going to do about the solar flare as well?

Speaker 1:          01:02          I guess a lead lined box is about the best you can do all of these things. Point out the fact that electronic storage is pretty fragile. If you want to keep something permanently, you should probably keep it in paper form. And that is why an e version of your will is not acceptable. And the reason is it's very hackable and forageable as I said, the net is leaky, uh, and a number of other legal documents, which of course drives people crazy because those paper things take up so much room. So it's a problem facing businesses. What to do with the paper, why does the alternative to paper, when can he is a storage, et cetera. It's also a problem for people. For instance, with small apartments who liked to read, where are they going to put all the books? The ereader gives you portability, it gives you instant accessibility, uh, and it gives you the possibility of having a whole bunch of books with you at once on this little device.

Speaker 1:          02:11          So for that it's very, very handy. Those are the pluses. I personally think that it's going to increase rating because you can acquire about very quickly, you don't have to go, you don't have to wait. If you could just push the button and it's there. If you really like it and want to keep it, you may then go get a paper version. It does remove the element of serendipity w by which I mean you walk into a bookstore with the idea of getting this book and just say three or four other books that you really feel you must have, but you wouldn't have known about them unless you went into the store. So how to, how to create and an e version, that experience of serendipity, it's, it's really hard. So people are thinking about this. There's a lot. The other virtue of the ereader may be that it's, but it's helpful for, um, kids are having reading problems because they can isolate blocks of text and make the letters bigger.
