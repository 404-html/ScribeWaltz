Jared here, it may be the new year, but we've still got a massive hangover from 2017 final blockbuster, right? A film that left us cross eyed and confused. Netflix spent $90, million dollars combining two of our favorite things, the dystopian fantasy and the buddy cop and left us with the world's most expensive WTF. We've been scratching our heads trying to figure out how such an awesome concept. Think rush hour too. If the deathly hallows or lethal weapon of the rings ended up feeling as biggest show as David Ayers last movie. Sorry, I couldn't help it. Like other fantasy films, it seems to be using it's imaginary setting to tell a compelling story while also illuminating truths about our society. However, both its plot and any potential underlying meaning become completely muddled by the films.

Speaker 1:          00:55          Poor world-building, lousy character development and ill suited metaphors about American racial politics. So let's find out what happened in this week's [inaudible] condition on bright, what went wrong, and if you liked this sort of thing, there's more where this came from in our movie podcast. Show me the meaning, links in the description, and be sure to check it out. And as always, major, minor and vaguely judgmental spoilers ahead. Headscratcher number one, building the world. Every time you see a film, you're asked to take a leap of faith and accept some kind of proposition that loving parents occasionally leave their youngest child behind when they go on vacation or that Keanu reeves is the most bad ass assassin ever. But when you're watching a fantasy that plays with gravity, object permanence or the entertainment potential of a piece of furniture, filmmakers have to convince you to take a mountain everest size leap off a peak of disbelief and land with their characters in a distant galaxy, middle earth or a far away distant land inside a wardrobe. A good script gets the audience to buy into its world by explaining the rules of that world coherently and concisely and getting the heck on with the story. Think of how effective Lord of the rings is in briefing the audience on the history of middle Earth's most sought after jewelry

Speaker 2:          02:05          with the forging of the great rings. Three were given to the elks, seven to the dwarf loads, and nine, nine rings were gifted to the race of men, but they will, all of them to see for another ring was made. I'm mastering to control all others. One ring to rule them all

Speaker 1:          02:28          with an origin story clocking in at six minutes. That film situates US firmly in this complex world for it even leaner example, consider star wars epic rolling title card that introduces you to an intergalactic space war in the time it takes to unwrap a candy bar. Both films Orient the audience quickly and then they're off to the races. Brights, origin story. On the other hand, it's just plain messy to voltage and sloppy, repetitive yet in complete fragments, but before we analyze the world building strategies, a brief overview of the mythology behind bright 2000 years ago, something gnarly went down with a dark Lord. All your excited with him except this one ORC Gerard, who somehow united the nine races together and who are the nine races. While it's not exactly clear, we've got the elves, humans or fairies and for the eagle eyed viewers, but anyway, they managed to take down the dark lord except oops.

Speaker 1:          03:17          Ease ready to come back and all his demons, Elvis need to do is bring three ones together. Watch out though. Only a bright can hold a one which creates complications still. Even if the dark Ford does rise, he can be stopped with magic. That whole subplot never comes to fruition though. Probably to be saved for the recently greenlit sequel that will hopefully come with some clarification now. It's totally understandable that the minds behind Brian wanted to veer away from the dramatically narrated storybook style opener of Lord of the rings. It's not exactly the freshest turf in the screen writing world or it would be understandable if bright hadn't started out with an equally cheesy but less eloquent quote. That sounds like it came out of a 10 year old's dungeons and dragons game. From there, they have an opening sequence of cringeworthy tagging. You would think with $90,000,000 they can afford to hire a decent la graffiti artists.

Speaker 1:          04:03          Through this we learned there's interspecies upheaval, police brutality and lizard people roaming the streets. You know, it's pretty rude to tease the existence of Lizard people and not the liver, but I digress. These shots of the street explained some atmospheric aspects of the film's world, but we're still missing the cold hard facts. For instance, who is the dark lord and what did he do and why are all the social media influencers, elves. We weren't the only people scratching our heads either after fans expressed widespread confusion as to what the heck was going on with all this dark lord stuff. Netflix released what amounted to a two minute instruction manual for the film and it's we're given a few thousand years of magical history with factual nuggets like Jurek was hailed as the first, but if Dirac saved everyone, why do people hate orange so damn much?

Speaker 1:          04:49          And how did this world social order come about? This video feels more like a hastily concocted admission of guilt that this film was confusing as hell. Another world building issue is the way the film conveys the limited information it does tell the audience which brings us to a fundamental screen writing rule showing versus telling. Showing is when a film conveys information through characters. Actions telling is when characters chat about the events of the world, the narrative equivalent of an Intel briefing for the audience, and boy is bright a telephone for route. The film characters regularly serve as embedded narrators, a strategy that swallows the action and create stiff, unrealistic dialogue. For instance, the award for worst line in the film goes to wards daughter in this cringy.

Speaker 3:          05:34          Everybody hates please.

Speaker 1:          05:36          Okay, we get it. Another prime example comes from ward early on.

Speaker 3:          05:40          Hey, look, I got to do to my car. The whole world is watching. All right. I didn't ask for it. I don't want it, but I don't get a vote.

Speaker 1:          05:49          First of all, this speech is stupendously heavy handed. Nobody talks like this. Secondly, these facts can be shown in a natural way through the narrative. In fact, Ward makes it pretty clear he'd rather be done by a ferry than right to work alongside Jacoby,

Speaker 4:          06:02          so I'm in a phase where he just shut up. Don't say anything, just draw out a word.

Speaker 1:          06:11          Still. The winner for the most forest proxy narrator has to be the smelly sword. Wielding bum who goes from trying to Samurai, a crowd of people to calmly relaying the entire world's backstory without even a shower break. Nine races shoulder to shoulder to give you the world you neglect the. Now, the dark one returned to reclaim our carts. Then as the feds interrogate him, he gives a plotting explanation of the shield of light in Fernie wands. The dark Lord Layla Tika, and write this scene is a boring and b doesn't make sense unless you assume federal agents in charge of magic crime are Asfa confused by the rules of their world as we are. This strategy continues throughout the film wants to and ward, find the magic one and call for backup for skeezy. Cops show up and give us another forced lecture on how magic works.

Speaker 4:          07:03          That's magic right there. That's whatever you want. You want a million dollars, 10 million, you want to be taller or shorter, make it bigger. You want to go back in time and marry the girl who didn't blow you on prom night. That's how you do it right there.

Speaker 1:          07:23          They continue to narrate the plot as it. The audience would be absolutely flummoxed by the concept of dirty cops, so it's thrilling.

Speaker 4:          07:31          Two cops die tonight.

Speaker 1:          07:32          It's clearly done for the audience's sake and it's Corny as hell. The scripts spooned feeds us. Huge plot points and small details alike. Like when Ward Jacobian Tika are fleeing the Mexican gang and ward yells, windows up. Bulletproof. Is he patronizing Jacoby or the audience who even knows just for fun, they remind us. Needless Exposition, head. Sometimes this tire, some exposition manages to somehow be both forced and and complete. For instance, Jacoby gives a snooze inducing and scattered explanation of his orchid idle Jeruk chemos who changed the world. Okay. And

Speaker 4:          08:10          they raised their place to him. He was flooded in that very moment.

Speaker 1:          08:15          Okay, so Dirac was a former farmer who was. Wait, what was that? Flooded

Speaker 4:          08:20          in that very moment.

Speaker 1:          08:22          Okay. Seriously, what is the deal with this flooding thing?

Speaker 4:          08:25          He's out. He's like a finger that got cut off the hand. He's dead to us.

Speaker 1:          08:31          Jacoby who is not flooded explains that. It's a sign of honor in the community.

Speaker 4:          08:36          What you did tonight. That's what it takes for an org to get blooded, an active, great bravery.

Speaker 1:          08:43          So are we supposed to think that all these other orcs are brave except Jacoby, the one who professionally puts his life in harm's way and what does blooding even mean? Jacoby sad dental situation as compared to his brother and it's definitely tooth related. We finally get a peek at this blooding ritual at the end of the film after Jacoby Saves Ward and the same orcs who only half an hour ago killed him slip their palms because apparently clan loyalty means never having to say you're sorry. Hey, least that's showing, not telling. So Goldstar. If only we understood what the heck is going on or how this crowd of orcs knew that Jacobi had just committed an act of bravery. Is there some kind of work bat signal? Are they just following Jacoby all night, waiting to shed blood, which would magically give jacoby the perfect or smile on the bright side. The next day. Jacoby does appear to be teething on his new fangs moving onto head scratcher. Number two, hero Shamiro. Whether you're writing about outer space downtown Baltimore or a wizarding school in an English castle, the first ingredient of a good story is a hero or two or three in bright. We have ward and Jacoby and neither will undergo significant character development over the course of the film. Ward begins the film as a snarky dickhead.

Speaker 4:          09:52          Well, if you in a box, I'll probably be like more song

Speaker 1:          09:58          and ends the film as a snarky dickhead dog. Now you blooded, Huh? Jacoby begins as a toothless, insecure guy who can't stand up for himself.

Speaker 4:          10:08          Hold.

Speaker 1:          10:10          Can you make a shootout?

Speaker 4:          10:11          Awkward. Sorry.

Speaker 1:          10:15          And ends. The film has a slightly tooth guy who ward still treats like a tattooed forrest gump thing. The nice federal agents.

Speaker 4:          10:24          Thank you.

Speaker 1:          10:25          Beyond that, for a film centered on an unlikely friendship, their relationship also seems pretty stagnant. At best, it could be said that ward learns to tolerate Jacobi and not narc on him, which is pretty bleak as far as buddy films go. It's not surprising. They never changed because they never really had character journeys to begin with. He number one rule in making a compelling hero according to Aaron Sorkin, is that somebody's gotta want something. Something's got to be standing in the way of getting it. You do that and you have a seat. Eventually you'll have a movie to Westley wants Princess Buttercup, Ferris bueller wants to cut class and party and so on and bright, not so much or doesn't appear to actively want anything except maybe to lose Jacoby as his partner and keep his job without being a corrupt asshole. That said he doesn't pursue those goals in any meaningful way.

Speaker 1:          11:13          Jacoby does want to be blooded, but as explained earlier, we don't really understand what the heck being blooded is or what it means for him as a character. Does he have to submit the clan loyalty to hang out with those Miami orcs? I mean, they seemed fun. While a, what makes a hero initially compelling the heroes choices or what makes it characters stay compelling, apparently Dustin Hoffman won't even sign onto a movie unless his character has no less than 40 points of choice in the script. Rather than 40 points of choice, our main guy's face approximately 40 points of coincidence that saved their butts. Such a coincidence is called a deus ex machina or a person or thing that appears suddenly and provides a contrived solution to and apparently insoluble difficulty. Most notable among these is the one in one instance, the wan solves the inconvenience of Jacoby dying in another awards, totally random status as a bright turns, what would have been an act of suicide into a semi heroic, a 100 percent coincidental fee.

Speaker 1:          12:10          Now for a head scratcher. Number three, when a metaphor is a train wreck, bright is littered with unsubtle metaphors comparing interspecies discrimination with real world racial discrimination. Even chance the rapper are called the metaphor a little shallow. We more than a little degree, but before we take a deep dive into the meanings at play, we want to give the following. Disclaimer, yes, this is a fictional world in which nine races coexist with varying levels of friction. Maybe the filmmakers had no intention of it being read as a precise metaphor for American racial politics. Problem is the movie practically begs you to draw this comparison. Where's the diversity hire you ride with? First off, it's a film about cops set in La, a city that was home to one of the country's most violent race riots ever. One which was specifically ignited by police violence towards black folks. Bright, very deliberately draws comparisons between orcs and black Americans in ways that are too obvious to ignore from the graffiti to the urban street, wear visual adaptations of black culture about their marginalized by other races in society and face victimization at the hands of the police in truly sophisticated symbolism. The films that just the cops would definitely kill the hooded or

Speaker 5:          13:22          and the troops are coming up. Humans with gone looking for new. Who shot a cop. You pick that kid had a chance

Speaker 1:          13:30          just for fun. One ORC tells Jacoby your buddies, so happy to say he's got an ORC friend. Not knowing that ward very dramatically doesn't do friends. You don't want me as a friend. Oh Jeez, dude, save it for your art therapist. That metaphor is referenced most disturbingly when Jacoby is hung by a rope during a fight scene with an Elf. I don't need to spell out why. Putting a character that has been signified as black in this situation is more than a little messed up. Oh, and one very important distinction between ORCS and black Americans. ORCS apparently caused their oppression or at least their great, great, great, great grand daddies did when they decided to side with the dark Lord Lord, a long time ago, and navient paid for it ever since. Needless to say, real racial prejudice does not work that way. I eat black Americans have zero sins to pay for.

Speaker 1:          14:19          When you're making a metaphor about race, it's important to be very, very precise because there's a real danger that an ill conceived metaphor can muddle an already complicated conversation to understand why. Let's examine the cognitive function of metaphors in there. Influential book metaphors. We live by scholars, George Lakoff and Mark Johnson explained that metaphors are vital to human beings understanding of the world around us. That's because metaphors are a way of taking a human's understanding of a simple, often physically tangible concept and transferring that understanding onto another poor, complicated concept, often one hidden from our senses or difficult to explain, play golf and Johnson. Are you then when we make a metaphor, say, comparing madness to love. We're not just momentarily linking to ideas. We're also transferring an extensive array of our cognitive associations about what constitutes madness onto love. As a result, a human struggling to write a Valentine card can explain why they have butterflies in their belly.

Speaker 1:          15:16          As a result, metaphors may create realities for us, especially social realities leading us to view the metaphor as being true. So in this case, lovers be cray. So what does all this have to do with fictional orcs? When a film like bright unsubtly evokes a metaphor that transfers the viewer's understanding of the inhuman orcs onto black Americans, they inherently invite the possibility that viewers will transfer all their cognitive associations about what constitutes orcs, a race of homogenous, inarticulate, tattooed gangsters onto that of the extremely complex and most importantly, human group of black Americans. It's not like bright is going to radically harm race relations, but this practice does place it somewhere in an ugly history of American cinema comparing people of color to inhuman creatures. Before we go further into this, it's important to address the colorblind elephant in the room. Bright depicts a world where a black man of wards status can exist seemingly without facing bigotry or to quote chance the rapper. Racism has gone because we hate ORC. Now that's messed up more so even when you couple it with wards, treatment of marginalized creatures, all of which have OIC treatment of black Americans by police officers. Whether he's saying very lives don't matter today or watching a bunch of orcs get beat up. Then asking Jacoby Your Cup first.

Speaker 1:          16:34          It just feels odd in a country where violence against black men by police officers remains heartbreakingly common depicting a black cop this way just feels way, way off the mark wards. Character seems to be there to both protect the film against charges of racism because how can a movie be racist when it shows a black man as equal and even getting to be racist himself and make a backwards argument about how far black America has come through an individual representation of a black man who's made it and earned respect. Now back to the specifics of the films depiction of Orcs, which makes it even more. While Jacoby is an honorable guy with a working moral compass. His depiction is not particularly flattering for starters, and there's no easy way to say this. Jacoby is not the sharpest, most painfully obvious near the end of the film would Jacobi cannot stop spilling incriminating evidence to the two federal agents turn turned around, just rocked the film. Doesn't make it better when ward tells his daughter. All of the races are different. While there is something to be said for respecting ethnic and cultural differences, wards comments seemed to suggest the existence of actual biological racial differences to have mad, Huh?

Speaker 1:          17:48          Excuse me. Her, the

Speaker 6:          17:50          detective. How many dogs play pro basketball? None. They're slow. They're heavy. That's why half the NFL defensive lines. It's not racist to physics.

Speaker 1:          17:58          Yes, they're fictional characters who are literally have different species, but the metaphor is still evokes black Americans and it feels plain weird. That coupled with Jacoby's clear inability to match words, intellect which falls into the trap of evoking hundreds of years of junk, racist biology that tried to excuse racism on the grounds that people of color were intellectually inferior. At the same time giving orcs, they super strong sense of smell gives them an animalistic quality. That again makes the metaphor super ugly, particularly when you consider the hundreds of years of white Americans treating black Americans like sub human beings as lakoff and Johnson explained what is it? Issue is not the truth or falsity of a metaphor, but the perceptions and inferences that follow from it and the actions that are sanctioned by it. Metaphors like the one in bright in comparing people of color to in human beings are up even if they had good intentions and as lake often Johnson explained, we define our reality in terms of metaphors and then proceed to act though it makes some superficial points about tolerance and encourages the audience to empathize with Jacoby's experience of marginalization, abusive friendships and kick me signs.

Speaker 1:          19:04          Brights overarching metaphor is just plain sloppy brights. Let us down, but given our world of inevitable sequels, prequels, three goals and squeak walls, we suspect elves and orcs. We'll be duking it out on your favorite streaming platform for years to come and we're not mad at it.
