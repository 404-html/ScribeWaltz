Speaker 1:          00:02          Oh, hi mark. Hi Mark.

Speaker 2:          00:13          Greetings and welcome to earthling cinema. I'm your host Garrick's worm. You Lloyd. This week's artifact is the room written, directed, and starring. My time traveling. God's son, Tommy Wiser. The film follows human banker Johnny, who despite everything about him is taken seriously by his friends. I was so happy. I have you as my best friend and I love Lisa so much. He lives with the apple of his eyeball, Lisa, and they are madly in love for two scenes, tired of Johnny's esophagus disorder. Lisa cheats on him with his bff, forelle mark, last name unknown. In fact, Lisa so done with Johnny's smoking hot bod. She gets him drunk to frame him for domestic abuse. Johnny naturally denies this to no one in particular. It's both. Did Not hit her. Did Not. Oh, hi mark. And makes his home phone where? Wire at an evacuation from the womb party. Mark and Lisa are caught swapping DNA orally. Why are you doing this? To save the relationship, Johnny announces that Lisa is more pregnant than a dramatic pause. We're expecting. Lisa, of course, denies this. There is no baby. Johnny Imitates a horse and market tax him before he can lay an egg heartbroken. Johnny locks himself in an indoor Porta potty, the phone rats on Lisa and they agree to a bitter breakup. Get Out, get out, get out of my life completely done with earth females. Johnny sucks. A glock.

Speaker 2:          01:46          The room is a tale of duplicity and the follies of love and trust to things I know little about the film takes many cues from classic dramas such as rebel Wilson Without a cause and the streetcar named desire. Part one,

Speaker 2:          02:07          the latter of which provided sematic inspiration for the room, which was oh, acknowledges with a little wink in the cold. Open Streetcar Concerns Blanche Dubai, a formerly wealthy female who tries to hide her past but winds up in Arkham asylum when her fantasy world crumbles just like blanche. The characters in the room live duplicitous often under the influence of c, two, h six zero. A wasted. I love you, Darling. Lisa pretends to be a devoted lover, but in reality is only using johnny for his sweet bitcoin. Mark pretends to be a loyal friend when he's actually in bed with Lisa fucking suggesting the soullessness that comes with living a lie. Almost all the characters deliver their performances in a robotic fashion. Oh, hey. How you doing? Yeah, I'm very busy. What's going on? That is to say with a battery of their butts. You're right. The computer business is too competitive.

Speaker 2:          03:00          The film accentuates this effect by juxtaposing these lifeless characters with the visceral energy of Chris r Kelly, although he's a criminal, he's the only character who is honest about who he is and therefore he's the only one who appears high on life and crack what is just as in streetcar, the room centers around a domestic location, Johnnie's apartment. The titular Tommy [inaudible] the room by concentrating the action on the home. The film focuses on the relationships that form the sort of conflict. The room takes a skeptical view of these interpersonal, intra human connections. Johnny appears to have a ton of friends on facebook, but in actuality they're just liking his status is out of boredom anymore. He's not worth it. The visual Motif of a foot sphere and capsulates the film's pessimistic view of friendship, although intended for comradery, it causes injury to two characters on your mat come up.

Speaker 2:          03:57          The message is clear. Friendship can hurt and mostly happens in alleyways. Similarly, early in the film, the color red symbolizes love and sex in the city and everything from Lisa's red dress to these red candles, to the roses in the bedroom to this ball gag at the end of the film. However, when Johnny rips up, the red dress shoots himself and dies in an ocean of blood, also known as hitting the Johnny. The colors, meaning is transformed to reflect the eventual outcome of some relationships and all of humanity in its emotional climax and sexual climax. The film breaks the fourth wall. When denny uses wise, those real first name, johnny plays brilliantly turning the camera on the audience. The film forces us to question whether we are deluding ourselves. I mean this film won an Oscar,

Speaker 3:          04:48          right? Didn't it? I mean, crashed. Did
