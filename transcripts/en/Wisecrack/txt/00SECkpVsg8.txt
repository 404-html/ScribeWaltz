Speaker 1:          00:09          Technologies,

Speaker 2:          00:10          the other field to you like to keep control and I was just in South Africa interestingly where there is an issue now between local South Africans, especially black ones who come from typically a deck around where they didn't have a lot of education and blacks and Bob when refugees who have a very good education and so they would get a lot of the it jobs except that they can't get working papers. So you know, whoever's got control of the resources it's going to use whatever excuse they can to keep other people out and it's not, it's not men going around specifically keeping the women out. But the, the culture of the old boys club, all these traditional things plus a, if you like, learned aversion to technology in science, especially among women and girls. And so all these things.

Speaker 1:          01:08          Interesting. Good role model

Speaker 2:          01:17          and just time, uh, there's a problem now with. It's not just women, it's men as well, not being interested in good, solid scientific, technical, mathematical education, which is key for all of this.
