Speaker 1:          00:02          A wise crack. Jared here in the flesh this time, you guys may or may not know this, but why Scott conditions take a really long time and we've been wanting to do something where we can quickly react to what's currently on TV or in theaters. So we, because we try it out with season three of rick and morty and hey, if you like this, let us know. We'd love to do these on things like game of thrones, stranger things, wherever this Jake Paul Person Is, you name it in Rick Man, the stone we see rick summer and morty traversing a Mad Max inspired post apocalypse. What struck me most about this episode was an idea that has popped up in previous episodes but hasn't been as fleshed out as fan favorites like existences, pain and everything you believe his bullshit scientifically traditions or an idiot thing. That idea modern alienation through April, right?

Speaker 1:          00:47          Glowing Rock, a mustachioed murderer and Jerry, the episode explores another depressing is guiding that society may be slowly destroying our soul. Welcome to this wisecrack quick take on rick, managing the stone and of course spoilers ahead, but first a quick recap. Rick Morty in summer infiltrate the aptly named death stalkers to steal a glowing rock that rick wants for science 40 and summer. Use this aggressive world to vent all they're confused emotions about their parents' divorce. Summer does all kinds of acting out and then falls for a swole dude with a bucket on his head and eventually goes through her own divorce. There he is, there's the nihilistic brute. I married allowing her to contextualize her parents' separation, morty fences, frustration by living vicariously through a revenge driven arm and eventually realizes he should just let it go. Maybe the lesson we've learned is that whether it's our parents marriage glowing green rock or an awesome giant arm, sooner or later you've got to let it go and rick acts like a child, kind of my daughter's going through a divorce and I am not dealing with it in a healthy way at all.

Speaker 1:          01:54          Early in the episode we hear Rick introduced the idea of alienation, but if you're really that alienated, I'm as willing to exploit it as the next Guy Church army or Olympic gymnastics trainer suggesting that summer's tension with Jerry has made her disillusioned and the only thing that can make her feel alive is to travel to a place where civilization has crumbled. Now the cover thing here is that the show not only tackles alienation on a micro level, the family kind that summer and morty experience, but on a macro level be alienation of society as a whole and through this, the show frames how we lose agency in our everyday lives. Hasten point, Sherry, I think this quote informs a lot of what's going on in this episode to live is to risk it off. Otherwise you're just in a NERC chunk of randomly assembled molecules drifting wherever the universe blows you. Oh, I'm sorry Jerry, I didn't see you there. How much of that did you hear? What rick is not so subtly suggesting is Jerry's complete and utter lack of personal resolve, power agency, whatever you want to call it, he's a doormat to the world. This idea of powerlessness informs a lot of mortise resentment towards Jerry as evidenced by this group standing in the driveway talking about custody and either Kelly or you want to stay married or get on with your life, but whatever you do, stop being a baby.

Speaker 2:          03:10          And this, I think if dad really wanted to be here, he'd stop at nothing to make that happen. You know, maybe dad just doesn't want you back. Or maybe he just doesn't have the strength to fight. And in either case, he's got his life, I got mine.

Speaker 1:          03:21          But mortise bitterness goes much further than Jerry's failed marriage. And that's because in some ways, jerry is the every man of the modern world. Since the days of the industrial revolution, people have been complaining about loss of control in the modern world instead of having our own trade or farm, many toil away at monotonous jobs. This loss of autonomy is reflected on by countless authors, scholars, and films. But we might as well just throw this example at you.

Speaker 3:          03:47          See, y'all need some attention. Nice. He's flown. God dammit and entire generation pumping gas waiting tables. Slaves with white cops. Advertising has is chasing cars and clothes, working jobs we hate so we can buy. We don't need the middle children of history, man. No purpose in place

Speaker 1:          04:08          and this is what frames mortise anger at Jerry's powerlessness. Jerry is the pinnacle of modern stew jury. His existence as a cog in a meaningless machine is really driven home in the Rick Shank. Redemption or the Galactic Federation keeps everyone compliant and docile through a liberal use of pharmaceuticals. I Galactic Federation taking over Earth's best thing that's ever happened to his family. I just got my six promotion this week and I still don't know what I do. In other words, jerry is so bad at being a person. He thrives in a society devoid of freedom. Summer show your father some respect. He's pulling down a six chewable figure income. His inability to assert himself is put on display in every interaction he has with rick. Of course there is a version of Jerry who isn't in Rick's words and a nerd chunk of randomly assembled molecules drifting wherever the universe bloats and that would be jerry from Cronenberg's when stripped of the trappings of modern society, Carey goes from being a useless hack in a loveless marriage to a total badass who seems to be keeping his marriage together.

Speaker 1:          05:08          This in itself is hilarious, but with this latest episode, I think Rick and more use playing with this idea that the trappings of modern society are inherently alienating and create Jerry's out of all of us. After rick introduces electricity to the wasteland, it's soon resembles a modern industrialized society. Summers, violent lifestyle has been traded in for every day. Banalities she is an out murdering ubs. She's grocery shopping for human bits. The savagery of the death stalkers has been reduced to complaining about recycling and hemorrhage. The murdering machine, is that what good for nothing. Couch potato. You haven't moved since I left to scavenge this morning. What's so clever here is the implication that modern comforts are what drive our banal, terrible lives with no mutans to fend off people resort to bickering about trivialities. We noticed that you've been put in scrap metal in the boom. I got it.

Speaker 1:          06:01          Due to electricity. People aren't murdering each other in the blood dome. They're watching blood doe see most post apocalyptic fiction functions as a cautionary tale of how awful our lives might become. But of course, being the darkest show on TV, rick and morty goes out of its way to prove that modern life is its own special brand of soul. Crushing our comforts eventually alienate us from meaning creating different kinds of misery. Or as Rick says about ruining summer's marriage. Grandpa just sped things up with a few creature comforts of modern society. So here's an interesting question that's a bit speculative, but the summer, forgive her father because she sees that modernization turns every man into an action list slow, even if you're a post apocalyptic badass. Now I want to speculate a little bit about Jerry here. It's likely that rick will stay the same old uncaring ass he's ever been.

Speaker 1:          06:52          But I think we're gonna see a lot of character growth in his family members. Specifically. Jerry, what if he has a tyler durden moment with the Cronenberg Sherry? What if he liked Edward Norton goes from being a disaffected modern buffoon to a man of action. I mean the show has countless references to popular cinema and I think a fight club shout out would work perfect for Jerry's season three arc. But Hey, I guess we're just going to have to see as season three continues. Thanks a lot for watching guys.
