Speaker 1:          00:03          I think we should make a distinction between Islam and Muslims. What I'm trying to do is to say all over the world, we can identify with each other as human beings. That is the basic, um, glue. The fact that you are an individual human being and I'm an individual human being. That's what's, that's where our common commonality or common strength lies in and common interest Islam. If we view it as one of the philosophies are political theories or ideas produced by human beings throughout history, just one of them and view, it's, scrutinize it, criticize it as we have done with all other doctrines, religious or secular, um, then we may be able from the West. Now I'm using [inaudible] as in someone who is Westernized, convinced Muslims to make a different choice and to reform their faith fast by acknowledging that there are things wrong with their faith.

Speaker 1:          01:09          So our goal should not be to be, to preserve Islam. Our goal should be the common human, you know, we are, we are human. So Muslims are humans. They're not fast meal point just as a baby in Pakistan or in Saudi Arabia or in Yemen or in a Muslim community here. If we emphasize that, then I think we can make that change. And that involves two things. That involves learning to distinguish between who is an enemy and who is a friend. But before you decide who is an enemy and who is a friend, you yourself have to decide what do you stand for? What are your own set of ideas that you feel as superior to that of Islam? And Are you willing to defend and die for your own ideas of freedom and humanity and humanism as much as the fanatics are willing to die for their own.

Speaker 1:          02:03          There is no consensus in the United States on who the enemies and whether to really say it's Islam or it's a perversion of a form of Islams. It will have is himself as in what was it basically just slam a who should we ally with strategically? Um, in other words, the approach has been very much strategic. There are people in the United States including this administration who are waking up to the fact that it is, there is a battle of ideas going on, but they're too shy to voice what the ideas are. Um, another point of criticism, and that's not only towards this administration, but I've seen how it all over the place is just this, this desire to avoid Saudi Arabia as a culprit of, you know, the states that's not only financing terrorism but also financing the ideology behind the terror act. I think it was a mistake to declare a war on terror.

Speaker 1:          03:03          Tara is just a tactic and it shows how much, how strategic the whole approach is to watch what's going on. Um, another mistake both on both sides of the Atlantic is lit. If we just appeased them. If you just understand what they want from us and we give it to them, they might not be so, so bad to us. So they might forget what the mates, I think those are mistakes that were made. But again, I'll come back to the distinction between Europe and America. And it seems as if America is learning much faster than Europe and my learning, I mean waking up to the fact that it is Islam, not necessarily all Muslims, but Islamism set of ideas and that that's kind of mean military. I mean very disastrous military action, which is for every politician is a terrible decision to take to say, we are going tall, we are going to do something destructive or we're going to take an unpopular action. And American seem to be much more courageous in making that decision. They did in the student the Second World War and later then the Europeans who have I, I think that European data ship at the point, this point is fairly self district, and I say this because of the, the approach to Iran.

Speaker 2:          04:35          Okay.
