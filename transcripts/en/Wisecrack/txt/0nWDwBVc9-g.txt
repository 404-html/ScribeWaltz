Speaker 1:          00:08          I think

Speaker 2:          00:09          the war on terror construct won't seem that important. Um, and I, I, uh, when nine slash 11 happened, we all believed including me, that it would be a, first of all that it was a typical event like Pearl Harbor, which now, you know, doesn't seem to be the case. Uh, and second of all that there would be many more nine slash 11 or several more, nine slash 11 and there haven't been. And I hope there aren't basically, um, it, it may be a with hindsight, which is always unfair that people will say, even though it was by far the worst terrorist attack in American history, you have to explain to your grandchildren why there was such an extreme reaction to one terrorist attack and why that, you know, seem to quote unquote change everything about American life and America's role in the world. I suspect that that's what we'll think a generation from now. And then the other thing I think is, um, uh, I, I suspect that this may be more of a hope, but I, I think I'm right that, you know, when we're sitting around with her grandchildren, the level of mistrust or the public sector will seem nutty in how high it was during this era.
