Speaker 1:          00:02          Yeah, yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:08          I mean, the thing that troubles me the most, they here in the country is it we become so partisan. Uh, I remember when I first joined the congress way back, 1980, uh, there was a rule, you know, the partisanship stops at the water's edge. That's blown, that's gone. Uh, there, there was a time in that, in that history when I joined the congress, when one party has such a commanding presence in the Congress or the other never even thought about gaining control. Well, I got along now they both realize they can control things if they just destroy each other sufficiently. I mean, the, the lesson of the Republican takeover of the house was it, uh, you know, if you could, if you could tear down institutions so dramatically in the eyes of the American public, you can take it over. Uh, that's been repeated now, uh, in, in the last election cycle.

Speaker 2:          00:57          And it will be repeated again if partisanship is, is so important in this country that, that, that people are willing to, you know, to just attack each other rather than debate each other's ideas. There was a, there was a better tutorial I think in one of the news magazines going way back. I remember I talked about the impact of television and negative campaigning upon the politics of our country. And um, I made the case that, you know, television was such a powerful entity that if you combined it with negative campaigning and negative advertising, you could wreck some pretty significant damage to our system. I think that's happened. Like they pointed out, you know, if Mcdonald's and Burger King had run ads for 10 years on television, not talking about how good that product right, but how awful the other guys' products were and I'm rotten and disease causing, et Cetera.

Speaker 2:          01:53          We wouldn't be choosing among brands. We would, we would be the hamburgers anymore. And the point that the article made was that, you know, we're reaching a stage where we're not choosing between candidates anymore. We're turning off on the whole system and Americans today a turning off dramatically on the two parties and the system, uh, the reputation of congress is an all time low presidencies. Reputation is at an all time low, uh, driven in large part by a willingness to attack each other rather than the debate our ideas as civilized human beings. And, and, and I think we face a real danger here in this country. If it continues at some point, respect for the institutions of our government, uh, either has to recover or this old time, lower experiencing is going to pull it apart. And, and who knows what we get in its place?

Speaker 2:          02:48          Well, I, you know this, there's an easy recipe and that is your recipe is to turn out anybody who plays negative politics and, and start insisting that candidates speak positively about each other and about their ideas and debate the ideas. And the, the, the national press could, could help with that. But obviously, you know, everybody likes a good fight. So instead we like negative politics. And as much as people say they don't like him and you check with the pollsters, they work there, they, they literally help elect candidates. If I can make you believe the other guy's worse than I am, I get your vote. Uh, we gotta, we gotta recognize it. That ain't good for the country. We've got to change that. We've got to literally start rewarding positive politics in America. Again, we've got to start rewarding those who were willing to reach out across the, the, the middle of the chasm and work together that, you know, there are fewer and fewer people brave enough to do that in America.

Speaker 2:          03:45          We've got to start rewarding them when they do that. We've got, we've got to say to the Joe Lieberman is, we're not going to penalize you because you're reached across the aisle and work with, with Republicans on something that was important or to say the conservative Democrats that you're going to get penalized because you worked with Republican Party Republicans who reach across the aisle and work with Democrats on a health care issue. Whatever it is, we've got to start saying, that's okay. That's not only, okay, that's good and we can't let the parties run the show.
