Speaker 1:          00:09          Well dying, you know, is uncomfortable. I mean, they have particularly these days, I mean, even physically, it's not fun people because of the power of medicine, people are living much longer. They're living longer and accumulating more burden of disease often. And so they're dying in more pain than, than people, you know, the early part of the last century. Um, dying over prolonged periods of time. But then there's the inherently human emotional pain, existential pain of, of dying, which is, you know, again, sort of part and parcel of the human condition. The fact that we are able to contemplate our life and the meaning of our life and to be so articulate within ourselves and between people in the love that we have for one another, um, imposes a downside of, of knowing in such detail the, the, the extent of our losses, the feeling, uh, emotionally, the, um, the pain of losing people that we love losing people for whom are, uh, are the most important things of our life, uh, around whom our life revolves.

Speaker 1:          01:21          The notion of, you know, where am I going? What happens after I'm not here? There is a great deal of pain in having lived and contemplating non life for many people. What's interesting is we, even those, uh, most pure existentialists who contemplate nonexistence and don't believe in God or an afterlife, uh, feel the pain of nonexistence beyond this life. But if you ask them to contemplate it time before they were born, it has not nearly the amount of angst, in other words, existence before we were here has, has none of the emotional charge of existential annihilation beyond this life.

Speaker 2:          02:30          Okay.
