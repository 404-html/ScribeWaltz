Speaker 1:          00:12          I'm not saying that religion can't ever be useful or inspire good things, it's certainly can and has and, and will, and that's, that's a better than the alternative, but there's a distinction we have to recognize there's a distinction between something being true and so they'd been useful and every religion, every benign religion, every religion that's actually helping somebody sometimes could be functioning like a placebo. I mean, it could be, it could be totally barren of content and still useful in certain circumstances. I couldn't invent a religion right now which we know is not true and would be extremely useful if I could spread it to billions invented right now. Just this religion is, um, the principles are, do your best to love your neighbor and you and your family and every person you meet, uh, encourage your children to study science and mathematics to the best of their abilities.

Speaker 1:          01:10          Um, and if you don't do this, you will be punished for eternity by 17 demons after death. Now, I have no doubt that if I could spread this to billions, this would be a better religion than the religions we've got. It will be better than Christianity and Judaism and Islam. You'd have no suicide bombers. What you would have is a generation of children bearing down on science and mathematics to the best of their abilities, encouraged by their otherwise ethical parents all under the the compulsion of do this or else the 17 demons will torture you for eternity. Does this with the usefulness of this? I mean this. We would, we would live in a much better world. No question. The usefulness of this. Would this suggest for a moment that these 17 demons actually exist? Would it, would it provide a reason to believe in, in these 17 demons, a not even slightly. So that's, that's the divide here. There's, there's, there's a big difference between the utility of an idea or the consoling nature of an idea. I mean, the idea that God has a plan for me or everything happens for a reason, and the idea that these are consoling is quite distinct from whether there are good reasons to believe right.
