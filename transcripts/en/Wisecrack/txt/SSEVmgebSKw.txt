Speaker 1:          00:00          This video is sponsored by movement, watches and sunglasses. More on movement at the end of this video. Hey, wise crack jared here. Today we're talking about the story of a guy who takes down the finance industry as he's hawks to imaginary friends. That's right, Mr. Robot. Mr. Robot follows hoody clad hacker Elliot Alderson as he and his buddies instigated a revolution and take down equal a fictional mega corporation. That's the gold standard of corporate malevolence, a conglomeration of Bank of America, Walmart and Enron also Elliot's crazy on the surface. Mr. Robot is a show criticizing capitalism. Tell him about the type of money makes you question right and wrong, but to really understand Mr. Robot, we have to dig deeper into an idea that is woven into the very fabric of the show. Alienation. Alienation means to be estranged and isolated. In the parlance of Mr.

Speaker 1:          00:57          Robot disconnected philosophy deals with different kinds of alienation. There's alienation from humanity, from the world, and even personal alienation where you've become a stranger to yourself. Mr. Robot explores them all. Welcome with his wives cry condition on the philosophy of Mr. Robot. Oh and spoiler alert. Mr. Robot is about lonely people trying to connect. Sometimes that means quite literally connecting illegally to other people's computers. Agent Dipiro has no life, no life and struggles to connect with both strange men on the internet and her Amazon Alexa. Elliot struggles to connect with his family, his past, his friends, and even reality and the masses according to Elliot can only connect to each other through facebook, instagram, and linkedin. The show, even employees visual tricks to emphasize the distance between characters such as wide angle lenses and framing characters near the edge of the screen. Elliot's and ability to connect is caused by more than just his social anxiety or that he talks to his dead father.

Speaker 1:          01:56          Instead, Elliot's alienation has everything to do with God. Let me explain. Elliot is unable to understand his actions, his motives, or even his relationship to other people. Mr Robot takes charge of Elliot's physical body interacting with people on his behalf all while Elliot is completely unaware that anything is transpired. As a result, Elliot isn't able to understand his relationship with his sister, Darlene, or anyone else he might've interacted with. As Mr. Robot and while Elliot Psychosis makes his alienation from himself and others unique, the logic that dictates that psychosis is nearly universal for German philosopher, Ludvig Feuerbach, whose name means fire stream. But I digress. God was the primary engine of alienation during the 19th century. Humans created the figure of God according to the lawyer Bach and instilled in with their highest ideals, justice, love, wisdom, and so on, but being a forgetful species, they forgot.

Speaker 1:          02:52          Look at this virtuous God and said, hey, we're so much like this guy. He made us just like him in this way. The fact that man made God in man's image is inverted to God created man in God's image. As a result, Christianity is alienating. We become estranged from our ideals, ourselves and each other because we can only relate to them through the medium of God of figure that we've since lost control of, if this seems strangely familiar, it should. Elliot creates the figure of Mr. Robot forgets he created him and then goes about letting Mr robot run his life in good feuerbach, Ian and fashion. Elliot says, Mr. Robot has become my God and even creates Mr robot in his own crazy image. Mr Robot is even liken to an omniscient God always watching Mr. Robot, you have a presence. Elliot's first response to the problem, Mr.

Speaker 1:          03:46          Robot is to get rid of him. He pumps himself full of adderall and starts journaling in the hopes that he can kill him off. This in a way parallels the atheist response to God, but I don't listen to my imaginary friend. Why should I listen to yours? We invented God. Now we realize it, so let's dump Joe, but Elliot's therapist convinces him that the answer isn't to dump Mr. Robot, it's to accept his delusion as part of it. At this point, I think we have to accept the fact that he is the legitimate and existence and your life for 40 bucks. The biggest problem isn't that we invented God. It's that we inverted our relationship to God and said, he created us. I'm only supposed to be a prophet. You're supposed to be my God or voc thinks that God is the ultimate object of thinking man, a creation that speaks to the unlimited potential of our reason.

Speaker 1:          04:37          Similarly, Mr Robot represents Elliot's highest ideals, creating a better future without Evil Corp. One of the big issues with alienation is the loss of responsibility. You know the old, I don't hate you, God does. It wasn't. Elliot either suppresses the memory of the unpleasant acts. He has to commit in the name of a better future like allegedly killing a guy or imagines. Mr. Robot is responsible in the process. Elliot isn't able to directly relate to the world. He helps shape or his peers and instead has to relate to the medium of Mr. Robot, right? It's only when Elliot admits that Mr. Robot is his own creation. Betty can finally carve a path out of his own alienation. When we've mixed up the relationship between God and the world around us, the world becomes confusing cause and effects seem to invert themselves. Galilee slips away and we lose touch with our fellow man. No longer are we the drivers of our faith, but events are laid out by the divine or your imaginary friend. We're no longer the judge of our actions or the actions of others. God is the rest of the world doesn't see Mr. Robot, but that doesn't stop the show from drawing an explicit connection between Elliott's delusions and there.

Speaker 1:          05:50          So don't tell me about not being real. While Mr. Robot may be Elliot Scott, the masses have a different God consumerism, which brings us to eight different kinds of alienation. Show Creator Sam. Ismael holds nothing back in paying homage to other films, critical of consumer culture, aside from the obvious fight club and V for vendetta references. One scene evokes John Carpenter's, they live of film exploring the truth behind modern capitalism and Tyrrell. Welock is one big O, two American psycho of film where people become as disposable as commodity sorbet. Likewise, one of the central tenants of Mr Robot is that consumer culture is a collective delusion. One that is strange is us from the world and each other. When Mr. Robot reminds Elliot that nothing is real. He says,

Speaker 2:          06:35          oh whoa. Builds on fence. Synthetic emotions in the form of pills, psychological warfare in the form of advertising.

Speaker 1:          06:43          Season one elliot decides to be normal by hearting things on instagram, watching marvel movies and drinking starbucks, drinking starbucks throughout the show. Material Items and wealth is strange people from their true selves. Whenever Angela Moss has confronted about her working for Evil Corp, for instance, she defends her character with displays of wealth. When she goes to buy a new pair of shoes to replace a pair covered in her coworkers brains, the salesman confronts her saying,

Speaker 3:          07:10          tell me witness this thing. You're here to buy new shoes.

Speaker 1:          07:17          I don't know who you think you're talking to, but I'll try the products next. When again, confronted at a bar by her father's friend. She responds

Speaker 2:          07:26          in 2007 and I've got a six figure salary at the biggest thing on right in history and I'm just getting started.

Speaker 1:          07:35          If Angeles motive seem unclear to the viewer, they're probably also unclear to her, and a strange world is a disorienting word. Angela, who stresses she needs the job. Evil Corp officer is in the same light as the guy who has to euthanize dogs for a living. It's just sick that in on me. I got to pay the bills or the homeless guy who allows Tarell to beat him senseless while wearing sterilized surgical gloves in prison. Leon can only relate to elliot with the prisons. DVD Collection, namely Seinfeld, a show about nothing. The human condition is a straight of tragedy because in all of these cases, mass culture and commodities inhibit our very being. Advertising and media encourage us to destroy a part of ourselves to fit in.

Speaker 3:          08:15          You destroy parts of ourselves. Every day. We Photoshop our wards, Hawaii annihilation is all we are.

Speaker 1:          08:23          It sells us pre packaged narratives about love and life for Elliot. Only when we destroy the alienating forces of consumerism, can we finally be free?

Speaker 3:          08:32          We will find our true selves again maybe after wiping away the thick, grimy film, a facebook friend requests and vine stars.

Speaker 1:          08:41          Thus, Mr. Robot shows a another kind of alienation. Commodity fetishes, commodity fetishism works a lot like for your box alienation and it should, it's greater. Karl Marx appropriated for your box work for his own ends, for marks of God mediating human relations commodities. Do we imbue commodities with abstract value in such a way that everything becomes commodified for Tyrell Welock? Every interaction is an exchange. Even going so far is he uses own body in pursuit of greater wealth. In the case of the Washington township trial, the people who died as a result of evil corpse actions or treated as mere commodities, profits are more important than people's lives. It's for the same reason that evil corporate executives can so easily forgive colby after he testified against them. Every action isn't some indicator of your character, but an exchange of goods and services. In the same vein, Philip Price Hires Angela despite the fact that she blackmailed them, but what exactly are the stakes of alienation in the world of Mr? Robot. It's control for both Feuerbach and Marx, the world of the object of collective human labor, the Labor that affirms our species being or our membership to the human race alienation destroys that species being because the world that we collectively build together as now been hijacked by someone or something else, it's no surprise then that every character from Angela to elliot to Tyrrell to price and ministers, Zhong are vying for control. You've brought up this issue

Speaker 4:          10:08          before,

Speaker 1:          10:10          this issue of not feeling like you're in control. The series even opens with a monologue about the people who have the real control in society. Secret board meetings, control who lives and dies over shrimp cocktails. So you were drunk eating shrimp cocktail and it was raining when you decided my mother would die and young people are racked with debt, forcing them into jobs they hate and Elliot can't stop the voice in his head from taking over his life. Ministers Zhang is obsessed with time surrounding himself with clocks, if only to remind them of the one thing he can't control. Nice. Just put a walking shadow. No poor player that struts and Brett's, he's on his stage and Ben is hurting.

Speaker 1:          10:55          You surrounded yourself with the constant reminder of mortality. Led, seen, constantly scribbling in his notebook about control or fighting for control with Mr. Robot, he attributes Shayla is abused by Fernando Vera to the invisible hand, the economic forces that control her life. There it is again the invisible hand at work controlling us even if it pushes us past our threshold. In his therapist's office, he likens the freedom afforded by contemporary society to the choice between Pepsi and coke. The real question is, where's the RC Cola? Both tyrrell and Elliot blame their fathers for their lack of control. Early on, Elliot blames his father for giving up when Evil Corp poisoned him.

Speaker 4:          11:33          It's about how those bastard slowly killed your father and how he wished he'd done something about it, but he didn't because he was his hero. Just like you're being right now.

Speaker 1:          11:43          Hi, Raul never wants to become his father who's inability to speak English was a reminder of his helplessness. Father used to say that to me all the time as a child, what was the only English she knew? The journals that Elliot frantically whites about controlling is aptly named red wheelbarrow tyrrells own reminder of his father's impotence. I'm silly. Po Tyrell also likens murdering. Sharon knows to absolute power. He and others are really into playing. God tend to leave a legacy.

Speaker 1:          12:14          The standard of which was set by God. Elliot at times is unsure if he's Mr. Robot Scott or Mr. Robot is his God. In the end, Mr robot shows that nobody is really in control in an alienated world. The people at the top have become victims of their own machinations. While they may try to create an illusion of control with armies of lawyers, convoluted conspiracies and bunker data centers, they all experienced the same alienating forces as the rest of society, whether it be in the form of God or commodity fetishism. Conclusion. Mr. Robot is not only a show about lonely people trying to connect, it's about the engines that drive that loneliness, whether it's God or imaginary friends or the things we own. That engine distorts our perceptions and turns a reality on its head. We can never really be sure what's reality or delusion and Mr.
