Speaker 1:          00:02          Hey guys, jared again. Today we're talking about your favorite ocelot enthusiasts. Mallory Archer and his crew of snarky foul mouth spies,

Speaker 2:          00:11          Jesus Christ.

Speaker 1:          00:14          Archer is sustained. Eight seasons worth of comedy would be occasional drastic reboot. So what we form a cartel, how hard could it be? So what makes archer work? What's its secret sauce? How does watching it feel like a familiar experience? Even as the show takes absurd leaps that would probably kill off any other show. Archer succeeds by inverting rules, characters and narrative tropes of the spies genre while using sound and language gags to build a unique arsenal of humor that explores deeper character's psychology.

Speaker 3:          00:44          Oh, it's Mrs J. Welcome

Speaker 1:          00:51          this wise crack addition on archer, and as always spoilers ahead, it should be no surprise that archer borrows plenty of the magic elements from James Bond and slash or hello, but these gags are more than just a shallow nod to double o seven bond films regularly pit. The freewheeling titular stood against these stuffy, boring rule makers best exemplified by him. To understand why this is important, we have to look at what was going on in America during the meteoric rise of the James Bond series. According to sociologists, Thomas Andre, this time period was a crisis of masculinity in which the male desire for autonomy and independence was displaced by pressure to sell out for a desk job with a 401k, leaving many a man feeling like an alienated but conforming employee of a large corporate bureaucracy. Spy Thrillers emerged as the perfect form of escapism with the character of James Bond, exemplifying the ideals of independence agency and individualism that were otherwise the lacking in the day to day life of most American men. Bonds, characterization as a chronic rulebreaker who relied on his charisma and sheer guts to succeed made him the perfect hero for the time. Unfortunately, be bond style. Secret agent is a complete fiction. Reportedly. After viewing a James Bond film, CIA officers would ask questions like, why wasn't bond required to prepare an expense report throughout the series? Archer takes this question and milks the humor of the unglamorous espionage bureaucracy. For all it's worth.

Speaker 2:          02:16          Forgot the balance in my God damn cow date of employment or

Speaker 1:          02:24          mindless paperwork occupies a central role on the show. Frequently threatening archers ability to live his best spy life.

Speaker 2:          02:31          You turned in an expense report from Berlin with the German desk, says you've never checked in Berlin. Too busy to chose. Yeah,

Speaker 1:          02:40          the show contrast the fantastical action sequences with the Monday and ease of office life to amazing comic effect

Speaker 4:          02:48          beneficiary on my company life insurance.

Speaker 1:          02:53          Even when archer does escape the bureaucratic ramifications of his actions, it's only because of his boss, mom mallory's forgiveness. Later in the series when the agency becomes a private investigation firm, Cyril is the only one eligible for a Pi license. As a result, archer has to suffer the indignity of working for the figures agency. While a character like Cyril prospers in the world of espionage, bureaucracy, archers, swashbuckling, antics are usually counterproductive. I don't see what could possibly go wrong and a quick note on Cyril, whereas some might associate paper pushers like him with emasculated stooges. Cyril is instead addicted to sex. Hello? Hello, hello. And hypersexualized. I think I need a spanking. Archers. The ultimate James Bond parody, it's all about machismo, exemplifying the qualities he's best known for, and then taking them to their logical unromantic conclusion like bond archer is wild and untamed, using drinking, fighting womanizing cars, and guns to affirm his manliness. You want to see who's a big boy grow up. The decades bond films have fetishize the latest, sexiest car. Aston Martin sponsored 12 of the 24 bond movies usually offering promotional deals to let fan boys live out their dream of buying a bond car. On the other hand, archers car is a birthday gift from his mother, presented to him as if it's his super sweet 16. Oh my God.

Speaker 1:          04:21          Adding to the adolescent field, the car gives archer and embarrassing erection. Oh God. He's got an erection. The show mocks the way that bonds hypermasculinity was and still is used to sell products like cars and beer to men who want to embody the same qualities, challenges, special agent addition brought to you by dodge, dodge, then go for the best of times. Archers car may be a marker of his manliness, but it's one that's on loan from Mommy who confiscates it. Days later, again, be supposed masculine power of archer is yanked away by his more powerful mother. James Bond is one of cinemas, most famous eductors. Similarly, archer is hypersexual, constantly hiring sex workers, sleeping with every office. Mate. Would you please come in this dirty toilet stall and have sex with me and propositioning every woman with a beating pulse and some without. Could you close your eyes?

Speaker 1:          05:16          I kind of feel like I'm banging tail lights on a country road. Of course, while bond sexual prowess is legendary, archers is less than that. Oh, you finished. All right. Maybe try. Well, I weights by the way, makes one of us, and while bond sex life come seemingly without physical consequences. Archer frequently comes down with stds and has to pay for abortions. Oh, pay for other health effects of the bond in lifestyle are also taken to a logical extreme. Wild James Bond is known to enjoy his liquor. Archers. Substance use is super human. At one point, he literally chugged germicide. His drinking appears to play at least some role in him getting these Feminine Disease of Breast Cancer and a history of alcoholism, you know, I mean, I drink socially, but

Speaker 1:          06:05          I didn't have breakfast, hardly the stuff of a double o playboy before archer undergoes chemo. He has some of his sperm frozen later on. Lot of secretly uses that sperm to become pregnant and have his baby without his permission or even his knowledge for the oblivious archer. Even becoming a father somehow plays out as a twisted form of emasculation cancer isn't the only health ramifications of archer secret agent lifestyle. There's also tonight is a hearing loss caused by too many damn guns going off all the time. Either James Bond is always wearing earplugs or his craters. Ignore the pesky realities of inner ear damage. At one point, archer and his crew even solidify tonight, us as the show's pet cause attending an annual fundraiser for the American Tinnitus Association. Once again, archer subverts the bulletproof James Bond and fantasy by dragging archer into the bleakest realities of his mortal body.

Speaker 1:          06:57          But is there something more to archers? Hearing loss communication scholar. Ian, I think so in his essay, archer, a spy parody for the ears dot argues that archers tonight is is more than an ongoing gag. It's actually an important aspect of the show's preoccupation with sound and language which are both used to generate laughs and to provide deeper insights into character psychology to prove this doc conducted a study in which he watched every episode of archers, third and fourth seasons, and counted the number of linguistic or sound specific references including language jokes like puns, foreign language references or loud gunfire followed by the high pitched ringing of archers. Tinnitus dot found that such references occurred on average 10 times per episode in the third season and 11 times in the fourth, which comes out to approximately once every two minutes just as mundane office politics serve as a humorous contrast to the life threatening action sequences. The show's language jokes are often employed at the most inopportune moments. Don't take special interest in one of the shows. Simplest ongoing gags.

Speaker 5:          08:02          Bada Bada

Speaker 1:          08:07          archers. Frequent act of calling out loudly to Elana even when she is nearby is more than just a simple annoyance. It's reminiscent of a baby calling out for its mother, which for Archer probably never quite gave him the comfort he needed. I don't feel good. What the hell? Essentially archers increasingly louder appeals to signal his inability to control his demand for attention. Eventually other characters adopt the same gag. Pam,

Speaker 1:          08:37          based on the growing frequency of these appeals for attention, Nga says clearly it is very important in this show for characters to be heard. However, it also seems to be important that they not be hurt too quickly by the listener bringing up the rooms of power, demand control, and psychological repression. For instance, take archers, classic phrasing, joke. Don't you want to freshen up after your long ride raising mother? This is a classic use of what Freud called Double Entendre in which the joke depends quite specially on the sexual meaning, even though the words have an alternative, nonsexual meaning. Freud thought that these sorts of jokes were way to release some of the nervous energy that comes from repressing sexual or aggressive desires. That's particularly significant when archers aiming the joke at his mother for whom he has more than an inkling of an oedipal complex clone of me, dead gives you know just half of one, but beyond that, when archer says phrasing, he's essentially choosing to miscommunicate and willfully misinterpreting the speaker's words.

Speaker 1:          09:35          Thus derailing the conversation by choosing to only hear the sexual innuendo. Archer often ensures that the person won't be hurt at all. I guess I'm a bad listener. The tech, they quickly becomes one of archers. Favorite ways of hijacking a conversation. As language tends to do phrasing spreads as the other characters start adopting it. Thank you for coming so quickly. In fact, the joke eventually become so ubiquitous that it actually circles back and falls out of fashion like Yolo or on fleek. Archers, anxiety over the plummeting popularity of his favorite joke only confirms how important these attention grabbing antiques are to his identity. The world's image of a perfect man reduced to a manchild phrasing isn't the only way to avoid hearing what a character usually his mother is really saying. Take the running gag about archers, voicemail messages which become increasingly elaborate ruses to trick his mother into thinking she's actually speaking to him.

Speaker 1:          10:29          Sterling Sterling listened very voicemail as a result. Mallory has entire conversations with is prerecorded voice before realizing she's been duped here. Archer is taking great pleasure in the power he's able to wield in a conversation with his mother. This voice message gag is archers hilarious. If juvenile means of temporarily reclaiming some power momentarily undermining mallory's dominance over him. I'm trying to just as archer has trouble bending to the will of Isis. As human resource department, you often find themselves struggling with the rules of language. I learned that flammable and inflammable mean the same thing. Both restraints prevent archer from living the bad ass spy narrative he envisions for himself. One such example occurs in the three part series, heart of archness. When Archer has declared himself king of the pirates, he attempts to address his subjects through his translator slash slave noah. Okay, pirates. Hey, take a knee.

Speaker 1:          11:25          That won't translate. It's like last week when you said, lend me your ears, and they were like, damn it. I can't do idiom. Sorry. Shut up. Archer attempts to convey his message without these idioms, but quickly finds it impossible. Oh, I never realized how much we rely on idiot. You'll win this round here. Archer shapes against the rules of language just like he chafes against the rules of bureaucracy, but even when he's not dealing with inconvenient language gaps, archer still has trouble expressing himself. No, I still got that stemer. While James Bond is well known for his pithy, one liners. Archer is not so gifted between his legs. Frequently regretting his failure to come up with the perfect witty line. Wait, wait, I got something for this. Hush puppies. Oh Damn. That's better. Again. Archer parodies bond by turning his funny offhanded Innuendos into a chore in which Archer Still Comes up.

Speaker 1:          12:19          Short operation, something about I rescue, Ilana, and she begs me to take her back so then you don't commit suicide. Swear to God. I had something at other times. Archers language isolates him, particularly when he's attempting to connect with others over his favorite obscure cultural references. I would prefer not to Bartleby the scrivener. Anybody? Not a big Melville crowd here, Huh? While he's constantly grasping to be heard and to impress through his brain, he call outs, he rarely receives any affirmation. Why am I William Sapphire? It's always disappointing to have your thoughtful cultural references fall flat and not even the greatest spy in this fictional cartoon land is immune to the shame. Read a book, archers chock full of fantastical fight sequences, wildly ambitious spy missions and unnecessarily complicated weapons technology, but much of the show's humor, rest in the linguistic communications between the characters I honestly have no response to that is lingering. Adolescent sense of being an outsider formed over and impressive 15 years spent at boarding school are perfectly expressed and his over enthusiasm for coining group slang and his wildly obscure pop culture references that inevitably fall flat. Most of all, archer embodies the perennial secret agent struggle born out of the 19 fifties, masculine anxiety about being cogs in the corporate machine, but what do you guys think? Will Sterling Archer ever learned to listen? Will there ever be a joke? Good enough to replace phrasing?
