Speaker 1:          00:00          Mm,

Speaker 2:          00:06          so when you're. We're fascinated with your election, hillary and trump, goodness, and everybody that you talk to says, well, how is trump being so successful? Why on earth are people tolerating sexist, racist, hate speech, and there was a good answer for it. I wrote a piece recently for time and I discussed why trump is having the sort of success that he's having at the moment and it comes down to one thing. Trump is a troll that has jumped off the internet and into the real world and the reason that so many people are tolerant of his extreme statements is name calling this horrible, nasty even stood sadistic behavior is because the online environment has normalized this type of behavior

Speaker 2:          01:19          in cyber psychology. We pointed out that what happens in the cyber world impacts on the real world. What happens in the real world impacts on the cyber world, and this is certainly true in terms of trump's behavior. There's a great study titled Trolls. Just want to have fun and you should read this because it talks about the dark tetrad of personality. The study found that people who say that they like to troll actually score high on an an index that measures machiavellianism and index that measures psychopathic traits and index that measures narcissistic traits and say doesn't, and the study found that trolling was a manifestation of everyday sadism. And election aside, I know it's important, but I'm more concerned about a bigger issue. The issue is that people like me spend our time trying to teach kids to be nice to each other online, but it's very hard for us to win that battle when politicians use cruelty and sadism as a strategy and appear to gain ground because of it.

Speaker 2:          02:44          So cyberspace is an environment. It's somewhere where you go. It's an immersive environment chatroom forum. It's a place. And what happens there is that behavior can become normalized. So as human beings, we're social creatures and we learn from others. So for peers that everybody is doing something, it can seem that it's okay and it's become very difficult with the pervasive penetration and accessibility of the Internet to draw the line between something that's in evolving behavior and that's become almost a social norm. And sadly, online trolling has become almost a social norm. The problem is when that behavior cyber migrates into the real world and trump and the way he behaves is a classic example of cyber like ration.
