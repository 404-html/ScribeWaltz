Speaker 1:          00:00          This video is brought to you by skillshare. Hey, wise, crack, jared here. One of the most Cathartic things about art for me is that it can give voice to our frustrations with the world, but while mocking, this system is as old as art itself in the 20th century of version of this story became popular in which characters not only criticize the system but actively escape it. I can cut it down, but recently something a bit different has become popular, like hero rises up to defeat, a degrading and exploitative system who we know is fake bikes, but in no time at all, something happens. The system manages to win in Black Mirror, at least our heroes rebellion against a system of compulsory exercise that is only redeemable for worthless forms of entertainment and digital swag gets sold as a worthless form of entertainment and digital swag. Is this the perfect metaphor for the world we live in?

Speaker 1:          00:57          Where anticapitalists insurrection one day get sold in mass by a large corporation. The next or how are we all just become nihilists? Join me live from the system itself as we dive into classics like network or Matrix, fight club, sorry to Bob, you and a few others to ask the question, is resistance even possible? Oh, also rick and Morty, because who can resist and yeah, heavy spoilers ahead, but first, how did we get here in the US during the 19 thirties factories dominated economic life and while those were the days where many people could raise a family by tightening rivets or something, artists like Charlie Chaplin, we're showing the bleaker side of this in his film, modern times chaplain expressed anxieties about losing oneself to factory life. Chaplains spends the film struggling to stand out, express himself, or make anything meaningful of his life. The film really captures one central complaint about fordist capitalism.

Speaker 1:          01:50          Work was repetitive, meaningless, and empty. You spend time on some assembly line or doing paperwork for your boss, and there was no individuality, creativity, or authenticity involved at all. At the end of the film, he resists the monotony of his life by walking off into the sunset to find his brighter, more authentic future. This fixation on the dehumanization of factory work and the escape, the something authentic evolved as our economy did. If it wasn't repetitive factory work, it was repetitive, pointless office work like in fight club, the narrator rails against the emasculating, alienating nature of consumerism. This is your life and it's ending one minimum of time before Rowdy Tyler durden sets up a gladiator pit for men to express their authentic masculinity and occasionally engage in domestic terrorism or office space which bemoans the drudgery of office work, tps reports and that God be printer or whatever the hell is going on in Brazil.

Speaker 1:          02:46          In the book, the new spirit of capitalism, Lucasville tanned skin. Each sapelo call this modern time slash fight clubs slash office space style, criticism of capitalism. The artistic critique. It focuses on the loss of autonomy and creativity as opposed to critiques that focus on things like poverty or wages. But what if all this complaining is just making the system they rail against all the more resilient, like our protagonists from black mirror or our second favorite, rick, and what if this isn't just something limited to fiction, but the very real workplace? Well, we can answer that question with something that's more interesting than it sounds. I promise. Management theory. Boltanski Sapelo observed a specific shift in management literature of the sixties and Seventies. They were all complaining about workers, bad attitudes and lack of motivation. What they found is that your modern time style artistic critique was actually affecting economic output workers completely unstimulated by the lack of autonomy or creativity or slacking off or worse, not even bothering to show up.

Speaker 1:          03:48          Furthermore, in France, at least all the talented college grads, we're no longer interested in goal middle management positions. Boltanski Sapelo named their book after one by sociologist Max Faber. Faber asks, how do you get people to buy into a new economic system? Well, if your religion thinks that you need to work hard until you die, otherwise you'll go to hell. Then it's a pretty great partner for emerging capitalism, especially if you got to do this all day. The spirit of capitalism is what engages people with capitalism in the sixties and seventies. That old spirit was failing. People wanted less fire and brimstone or even good union jobs and more free love and drugs, so Boltanski and Sapelo ask what's the new spirit? The new spirit of our modern era engages people on the grounds of things like autonomy, creativity, and freedom, but it's still the same system. The people are still biking all day, living meaningless lives, but at least they have been show to express their frustration for them. Likewise, you still have to work 12 hour shifts at subway, but at least you're now considered a sandwich artist, but going beyond this, what can we make of resistance in the new spirit of capitalism? Do we culturally need a critique of the artistic critique? Let's go to one of my favorites network. It's like 15 million merits. The movie after learning, he's about to be fired. News anchor, Howard beale announces his on air suicide.

Speaker 2:          05:18          I'm going to blow my brains out right on this program a week from today,

Speaker 1:          05:22          which he cynically remarked will make his dwindling ratings go through the roof,

Speaker 2:          05:27          going to get a hell of a writing out of that.

Speaker 1:          05:30          Then in a pseudo apology, he says, he just ran out of bolts and rants about the horrid state of the world. Hi, I'm mad as hell. I'm not going to take this anymore. His public meltdowns become so popular. He's reinstated bringing unprecedented ratings and therefore money to an otherwise small network. The network also creates the mouse a tongue. Our were a bonafide member of the Communist Party preaches revolution.

Speaker 2:          05:55          I'm lorraine, so bad ass Cami

Speaker 1:          05:58          culminating in one of my favorite lines in cinema.

Speaker 2:          06:01          I mean, that's why it's not going to see a Nigga goddamn show until we go and its indication.

Speaker 1:          06:04          The producers of network rightly perceive that the capitalist model is no longer about conformity. Allow modern times, but about rebellion and disillusionment. Those are the things that sell.

Speaker 2:          06:16          They turned off, shot up, and they themselves limp and nothing helps. The American people want somebody to articulate their rage for them.

Speaker 1:          06:23          Verbal Tansky and Chappelle existential rebellion, Marxist critique and revolutionary ideas have basically become the official style of contemporary capitalism, and you thought I meant that figuratively. Perhaps nothing encapsulates this better than the rick and morty episode, the Rick Way to mix up for a bunch of bricks, toil away in a dehumanizing factory only for an act of rebellion to be repackaged into wafers. They give you the taste of the unique flavor of shattering the grand illusion. We might consider media like network 15 million merits and simple. Rick's as the critique of the artistic critique. Why bother railing against the alienating nature of the system and it's just gonna help someone else's bottom line. Sometimes it's not just cooptation. Some media imagines a world where the alternative to the system is just as bad as the system itself. In Fight Club, for instance, men who complained about the degradation they face in their daily lives.

Speaker 1:          07:16          My two grown kids wouldn't even return. My phone calls eventually go on to join an organization where they have no names in project may have. We have no names are called maggots, maggots and routinely run the risk of getting their balls cut off. These guys are going to take your boss. Why did the men in fight club go from being in masculine and under capitalism to being literally emasculated by their new dictator? If anyone ever interferes with project, may even you got to get us balls because sometimes even our ideas for resistance come from the system itself. Other times, the resistance is literally created by the system to ensure its survival. Consider everyone's favorite trench coat. Jesus neo the first matrix makes it seem like neo is a classical savior. Come to liberate the humans from their enslavement to the machines and awakened them from their illusions, but we eventually learn in one of the most pedantic monologues of all time. That neo is just a product of the very system he wants to undo morpheus desire on even the prophecy are just part of the way the system tries to tame the human capacity for free will and use it against them

Speaker 2:          08:30          and we have become exceedingly efficient. So

Speaker 1:          08:35          freewill doesn't help folks find ways out of the system. The system accounts for freewill and channels that to the machines benefit, so pretty bleak, right? We can't escape the system. Some resistance actually comes right from the system and the Matrix sequels still shutting. We be crying in a corner and not consuming more media about disillusionment. If we fetishize durden's face on t shirts, haven't we missed the point entirely? Things you'll end up owning. Well, there are some movies that move to address this problem in snowpiercer. Survivors of Earth's new ice age, live on a train organized along class lines, the richest in the front, the poorest in the back, the poor stager, rebellion, and reach the front only to discover that the revolt was orchestrated by the trains leader to thin the population and ensure sustainability. At first, it seems not unlike our previous examples, but the rebels decide that they would rather crash the train and start all over.

Speaker 1:          09:36          Ben Settle for these simple taste of shattering the grand illusion. Does this mean that the only way to escape the system is to burn the world down? Well, not necessarily in the recent comedy. Sorry to bother you. We see a third option in this film star Telemarketer, Cassius Green inhabits a darkly familiar world where not even leaked footage of human slash horse hybrid slaves can prompt revolution, but instead earns a fist bump from the stock market and praise from scientists and investors get it. Capitalism is literally dehumanizing folks by turning them into equine people, and that's still not enough for a wakeup call. In some ways, maybe this holds a mirror to us. We respond any better when we hear about Amazon workers pissing and bottles. Not always. The film ends with a successful union strike that makes our protagonist life markedly better. Even though the film is a very skeptical about escaping the system entirely, it seems to place a lot of hope in these slow struggle to incrementally improve it.

Speaker 1:          10:35          So what do you guys think wise crack. Should we crash the train? Is there room for slow change or do simple rig wafers tastes too good to risk it worth it, and for prime examples of not being able to escape the system, consider this whether you want to break out of the routine of a nine to five job or whether you just want to expand the boundaries of your abilities.
