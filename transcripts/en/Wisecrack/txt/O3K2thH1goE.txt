Speaker 1:          00:03          Hey, wisecrack disembodied jared again here to continue our epic philosophy of Christopher Nolan trilogy. In our first installment, Nolan begins. We covered his interpretations of the self in his early films plus inception. What does it mean to be a self? How can we trust ourselves and our own thoughts? Today we're asking if there's so much conflict already present in the self. What are the implications for a community full of cells if we can't even handle our own issues? Is it possible to avoid conflict with other people or is violence inevitable? This is the foundational questions surrounding Gotham City in the dark knight trilogy, so suit up for some time with the Batman and were not wearing hockey pads. Welcomeness wisecrack addition on the philosophy of Christopher Nolan Park too, and Yup, there's spoilers ahead behind the face. Paint and pointy eared masks. Gotham is experiencing crisis after crisis that affect the functioning of its social body. The mob is pumping and drugs. The cops are helping the mob. The mob is hiring. Clowns and bomb seem to be getting trendier by the minute. Batman may be the focus, but his focus is on the city he loves. In the process of saving Gotham, the film's raised questions about the nature of community. How does a society deal with fear and threats? How does the presence of a hero like Batman creates or threatened stability? Can Society wide conflict ever be resolved or is it inherently a cyclical process?

Speaker 2:          01:30          What about escalation escalation where you start tearing semiautomatics day bio waste, dod wearing Kevlar body armor piercing rounds, and you're wearing a mask? Jumping off rooftops,

Speaker 1:          01:47          help us understand Nolan's social philosophy. We're turning to perpetually stoned looking anthropologists. Rene's Gerard Gerard claims that the concept of [inaudible] is both the foundation of all societies and the foundation of conflict in those societies. Gerard's theory claims that one of the most basic aspects of our relationships with other people is imitation. Imitation can be as simple as copying someone else's behavior. I see you buying someone a bad ass necklace and I think, wow, great idea, and I decided to go buy a necklace to everyone's happy, right? But this can become a problem. Gerard says that imitation of someone else's behaviors can and often does lead to replicating their desires. That's where I don't just want a necklace. I want that necklace to one you happen to be wearing. This is mimetic desire and it can pretty quickly lead to rivalry where multiple people share the same desire and so compete over finite resources.

Speaker 1:          02:44          Gerard claims that are human impulse toward imitation means that eventually more and more people will want that necklace and rivalries will grow and multiply until they're also profoundly impactful on the community itself. When one succeeds in winning the prize, the other people or their tribes or their surviving family members seek retaliation against the winter. This vengeance is also a form of imitation and it basically ensures that rivalries and violence will continue to grow. According to Gerard. This is the fundamental reason why there is crime, violence, and war in the world. As Batman begins begins. This turmoil is already established, obviously because according to Gerard, this cycle goes all the way back to cavemen, but what's important to note here is that we see individual examples of mummies occurring and motivating characters and most importantly it later on we see Nolan used mimetic theory to propose a possible solution to society wide violence.

Speaker 1:          03:44          So let's get started. Let me. This is most relevant in Batman begins as it relates to the individual, especially in the creation of the Batman identity. The original instance of this, this is one man's desire for the Wayne's wealth, which leads to violence throughout the film, Nolan for grounds, fear and vengeance as powerful motivators, especially in a city as broken as Gotham. We see this again in Bruce's imitation of his parents. Killer Joe, chill in his effort to exact vengeance versus time away from Gotham inspires him to move away from the cycle of vengeance that motivated him to avenge his parents. Instead, he uses invitation as a means of stopping violence. His fear of bats leads him to adopt the identity of a bat, but he uses this invitation as a means to spread the fear to criminals who now fear a different kind of back him

Speaker 3:          04:37          watching your seeking justice.

Speaker 1:          04:48          The League of shadows wants to press the reset button on conflict by destroying a society altogether, but that's not really how it works. The problem with their method is that watching people destroy each other doesn't actually do anything to decrease violence. It inflates it. There's nothing for people to unite around, so whatever survivors are left after the fire of London or the black plague or the microwaving of Gotham art still going to be really pissed off. So if the League of shadows gets it wrong, what does Batman get right? Even while Nolan presents us with the idea that it is difficult, if not impossible to break away from violence. Roost spends. The majority of Batman begins struggling to overcome both his fears and his impulse for vengeance. It can't be personal where you're just vigilante. In order to do that, that man has to transcend the identity of Bruce Wayne and become something else. And image in the collective consciousness that represents justice without personal motivation, he has to become a symbol to be imitated and it's this idea of symbols Gerard proposes that can break society out of violence.

Speaker 1:          05:56          Unlike the more individually focused themes of Batman begins. The dark knight transitions to these social consequences of the rapid spread of rivalries and fear. After the mobs ass whooping, the city begins to push back against organized crime and the faces of this effort, our Rv Dent new district attorney and got them White Knight and Batman. The wait for it dark night while the bat fights with battery and Harvard Lamborghinis Dent Fights, crime using the law as his weapon. The White Knight and the Dark Knight are symbiotic ideas. They both inspire imitation. While dent inspires the rest of the city government to aim for a safer Gotham, Batman Inspires copycats in poorly conceived Halloween costumes. Still those copycats are assigned and that the idea of Batman inspires hope among the citizens of Gotham. It's also a sign that those citizens are copying his tactic of replicating fear or at least trying to, but the mob pushes back as mobs tend to do, and the increasing escalation of conflict between the Knights and the criminals leads to Moroni.

Speaker 1:          07:02          Hiring the joker to kill Batman. Part of the danger of the joker is that he only has power because of how afraid the mob is. Listen, I know why you choose to have these little group therapy sessions in broad daylight. I know why you're afraid to go out at night. Batman Strategy for fighting crime has created a monster one that feeds on the mimetic reproduction of fear that that man relies on. So how can you break a cycle that has adapted to your methods of opposing? Gerard tells us that when violence and vengeance become so great that they threatened the existence of the society, the majority of people will quickly set aside their differences in order to sacrifice an individual the scapegoat whose death can restore temporary peace to the community. Everyone agrees that the whole thing was the scapegoats fault and Bam, boom, burned at the metaphorical steak.

Speaker 1:          07:57          And everyone chills out, but since it's literally impossible for an immense social conflict to be entirely one person's fault, the scapegoat is a lie and a pretty violent one at that. So peace doesn't last long and eventually someone cupboards by neighbors necklace all over again. Gerard says that since humans have an innate impulse toward violence and rivalry actually stopping those cycles of vengeance is basically impossible. With one exception, we can replace the scapegoat goat with a Christ like figure who rejects violence and turn the other cheek, and this could set a new imitative trend of people desiring nonviolence, Harvey Dent and his campaign for peace in Gotham appear to fill that role, providing a Christ figure for the community to emulate. I believe in Harvey, even Batman who can only fight violence with violence supports a world where dent replaces him taking up the mantle of crime, fighting without the need for grappling hooks them off.

Speaker 1:          08:54          I could never be your stance against organized crime. It's the first legitimate ray of light and cousin in decades, but the joker, a representation of the true violence of mankind shifts the course of the mimetic rivalry. And corrupts our Christ figure with a few oil drums and some sweet talk. Once Harvey to face begins to imitate the joker, embracing chaos and going after Gordon and the corrupt cops, he becomes subject to the cycles of violence that the white knight was supposed to destroy. So in order to restore peace to Gotham, we turned to the time honored tradition of the scapegoat. Gotham picks an individual. You're not blames him for the current social ills in this case, the crimes committed by two face and the joker's presence and punishes him in order to end the intense rivalries that threatened the existence of the community. They don't kill Bruce Wayne, but they effectively killed the symbol of the bat and at least for a while and during the period where Batman is gone, there is a time of relative peace and prosperity in the city, but the scapegoat is always based on a lie. The truth of the situation has to be unconsciously suppressed in order to achieve the desired effect for containing the violent impulses of humanity. However, this lie is unsustainable and this problem is the starting point of the dark knight rises.

Speaker 1:          10:17          Third film begins at a time of relative tranquility, brought on and sustained by the lie of Harvey Dent's martyrdom and the scapegoating of Batman. This is acknowledged by court, wasn't needed anymore. We want who just by recognizing the nature of the lie threatens the stability that depends on the mayor is going to dump him in the spring, really, but he's a hero, a war hero. This is peace time, but while the dent act made possible by the demonization of that man has effectively ended organized crime, there are other kinds of violence still at work in the city. The social and economic inequalities which defined the third film as one form of violence ends. Another begins, although it's hardly fair to say that social inequality is a new phenomenon in Gotham. [inaudible] were killed because of their wealth, but the disillusion of the mob means that the divides between the legitimate rich and the poor are once again in the spotlight and violent rivalry is inevitable.

Speaker 4:          11:19          I kind of wonder how you ever leave, so for the rest like

Speaker 1:          11:32          the joker, Bain is focused on revealing the violence that already exists in ordinary people, but while the joker explores the idea of chaos, Bain is interested in the concept of the law. There were big supplier with a false to stop tearing down this corrupt which undoes the piece that on that lie, the disruption of the myth of the scape goat means that the sacrifice of Batman no longer serves its purpose and its disappearance no longer helps the city

Speaker 1:          12:11          because Batman's sacrificed himself in order to save the city from itself. His return isn't as simple as hopping into a flying car and catching the bad guy to inspire the city. He has to metaphorically come back from the dead, which is shown in his ascent out of the pit. There's probably a lot of birth symbolism happening as he climbs out of a hole into the sunlight. But what's way more interesting is this explicit connection to rising from the dead and the comics. The underground cave has another name, the Lazarus pit. If you're not up to date with your new testament stories, Lazarus is a dude who died and Jesus brought him back to life. Yes, pretty much. That simple, he rose from the dead. Coincidence, probably not, especially since later on, Gordon reads a eulogy from a tale of two cities which describes, you guessed it, be Christ like sacrifice of one of the main characters, Nolan man, you're killing it with these lit references, and this leads us back to Gerard's Christ figure.

Speaker 1:          13:05          He claims that in order to have real lasting peace to remove our society and ourselves from the cycle of violence, we need to set aside the myth of the scapegoat and embrace a figure who sets an example of selflessness that forms a new mimetic desire to be copied by the masses, but even Gerard isn't sure that this is feasible if humans are driven by an innate desire for violence, isn't realistic to hope for something different. Gerard says that even in today's Christian communities, people don't really follow Christ's example. No one asks this question throughout the trilogy is peace actually possible. People battle their inner monsters and at the same time they're battling the monsters of Gotham, but can either of these ever find true resolution? It may appear that dent was a fake Christ figure. At the end of the dark night, while Batman becomes a legitimate Christ figure at the end of the dark, knight rises, but is this really the case?

Speaker 1:          14:00          When Batman takes the bomb out over the ocean, he saves the city from a very visible kind of violence, the radioactive kind, but the piece that follows is also based in part on the lie that Batman sacrificed his life to save the city. He gets a statue and the city gets a new martyr, but maybe the lie of Batman's death is outweighed by another trip that unliked end. He really did fight violence with self sacrifice, creating the potential for a new kind of mimetic desire. Anyone can copy his motivations even if atomic bombs are in short supply.

Speaker 3:          14:39          That was the point

Speaker 1:          14:41          and we see [inaudible] come full circle in Joseph Gordon Levitt character who is revealed at the end of the film to be none other than Robin. The fact that Robin is introduced and that Batman left him, all of his crime fighting tools suggests, but doesn't prove that piece may not last in Gotham, so how do we maintain stability in our communities? The openness of the ending person, Italy, robin in the bat cave and Batman all statute up lead us in a number of directions which is exactly Nolan's point is a scape goat myth or a lie necessary to maintain stability. Can a Christ figure really inspire people to abandon their violent urges or Ken Society never exist without conflict, no matter what we do. Is there always a future crisis on the horizon ultimately to the limits of human nature? Prevent us from achieving lasting peace or does the human spirit's allow us to overcome whatever obstacles may arise?

Speaker 1:          15:37          No one's later films like interstellar and Dunkirk. Give us a peek into the possibility of how and why we might transcend those limits like constructing new worlds.
