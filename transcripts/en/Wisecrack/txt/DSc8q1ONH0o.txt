Speaker 1:          00:05          Hey, wise, crack. Jared here. Full disclosure, this video was made possible by the people over at for. We've been fans of the Mondo show, happy tree friends for a while, so when verve reached out to us and asked us to check out the new Mondo show, Gary and his demons streaming exclusively on verb. We were pretty excited and five episodes in. We couldn't help but notice a lot of similarities to to otherwise crack favorites archer and this show that we've mentioned maybe once or twice before. Don't hate one particular moment stood out to us as particularly zeitgeisty.

Speaker 2:          00:37          When it comes to murdering people, I guess you could say. Why don't you say, I guess you could say here. That's what you're going to say. That's not what I was going to say. Pretty sure it is. Oh, it's not your whole personality. His hooks, man. There's other things you can say. All right.

Speaker 1:          00:54          Which reminded us of this. God, would you give it a rest?

Speaker 2:          01:02          Damn, I had something to this and this. I guess I did the Butler. Does it? Does that scan?

Speaker 1:          01:11          This subversion of hero one liners got us thinking, why is this kind of humor so prevalent these days? Is there something more going on here that says something about our modern social condition, and as we watched more, we realized that was just the tip of the iceberg, so if you haven't seen Gary and his demons yet, check out [inaudible] dot co slash wise, crack birth 30 day free trial and join us as we impart on a time honored, wise crack tradition over explaining a joke for the sake of social commentary. One thing we've noticed lately is a particular trend in comedy, subjecting the fantastic to the mundane in rick and morty. Be Fanciful Tale of Jack and the beanstalk is taken down a peg. When the narrative becomes mired in legal proceedings, be horrifying. Freddy Kruger has the same marital woes and performance anxiety as your average club and even the post apocalypse still has suburban domestic spats.

Speaker 2:          02:03          Dang, Dang. Dang. Wow. Everybody hear that

Speaker 1:          02:06          in archer, these secret agent fantasy of blowing up and womanizing is subjected to the realities of expense reports. Some serious discrepancies in your account, I'm sure you wouldn't use operational funds for personal expenses.

Speaker 2:          02:24          HR, most of my jobs dealing with sexual harassment complaints against Mr Archer and hearing loss. What Barry, what? We don't have any pepper. Earplugs. You idiot. You know how bad that is for your eardrums.

Speaker 1:          02:37          Gary and his demons does the same. Subjecting demon hunting to the mundane activities of office life and sock puppets.

Speaker 2:          02:44          You'd be comfortable talking to my friend. Suck Guy Suck.

Speaker 1:          02:51          Why does this comedy works so well and why now? Or at least for adult cartoon viewers between the ages of 18 and 34. Well to overly dramatic one could say it's because our dreams are dead still with me. Good. Because to understand why we're going to have to dive into the philosophy of humor. There are a few major theories of humor out there, but one that popped up only a few hundred years ago is incongruent. Basically the idea that humor arises from the discrepancy between our expectations and reality. I mean, what is a punchline, if not the subversion of our expectation?

Speaker 3:          03:27          Remember we used to smoke pot and then talk about how one day maybe we could be on Conan together. Yeah, that was yesterday, but

Speaker 1:          03:34          there's one philosopher who takes this further, arguing that humor arises from the [inaudible] between our notion of ourselves as humans and the subversion of that notion by the mechanical nature of our lives. While this theory is a bit antiquated, we can use it to help us understand humor. Today in 1900 philosopher Henri Bergson theorized that the source of humor was the mechanical encrusted upon the human writing during the industrial revolution. Bergson said, when we laugh because someone falls, it's not necessarily their misfortune that we find funny, but the spectacle of a machine malfunctioning. In this case, our bodies, for example, take the classic prank of pulling a chair out from under a friend about to sit. They fall on their ass. Hilarity ensues. According to Bergson, we laughed because an action, as routine as sitting down is basically the body on autopilot. Seeing that habitual emotion fail is what generates the lows, and while this kind of falling on your ass humor certainly predates machines.

Speaker 1:          04:33          We can still think of it in terms of mechanical rigidity against human flexibility. It's probably no coincidence that Bergson was writing when factories and machines reshaped modern life. More than 30 years later, Charlie Chaplin would in some ways embody elements of Bergson's theory in modern times where the intrusion of mechanization onto the human is put front and center. If modern times was so popular, was it because he struck a nerve with people's relationship to machines for chaplain? It's not just that humans are acting like machines, but have also become entangled in a society of machines which brings us to modern day. We no longer feel our sense of self threatened by physical machines, but another kind of machine you see Bergson's formulation has evolved. Humor isn't just the machine and crusted upon the human society and crusted upon the human, the component parts of society, state and corporate bureaucracy, cultural expectations all act like a kind of machine. One that happens to simultaneously feed us dreams and tear them away from us. The discrepancy between our fantasies that helped us cope with reality and the reality that forsakes those dreams is the new engine of humor. In 2018, Gary and his demons imagines a chosen demon hunter as a sad sack working stiff who can't even retire. I realized why, I mean all the time it's of my job sucks and my life

Speaker 2:          05:58          sucks more than anyone else's and that's

Speaker 1:          06:00          navel gazing. That is the truth. Demons have to face being in or out like fashion trends

Speaker 2:          06:06          that hot new mirror monster running his mouth about how the old guard is out of touch. Bloody Mary dates back to the 15 hundreds,

Speaker 1:          06:16          mira monster, and in archer. Even the exciting world of espionage won't take your mind off your flex account.

Speaker 2:          06:23          I got to spend the balance of my God damn flex account

Speaker 1:          06:27          and while Rick may be the only one above it all, I mean he's not bogged down by expense reports and bureaucracy net bureaucrats. I don't respect them. Just keep shooting morning his arch nemesis or a bunch of himself that reduce other versions of himself to factory workers and students. The whole joke of simple rick is revealing the real nature of escapist fantasy as just another cog in the soulless machine come home to the unique flavor of shattering the grand illusion. Come home to simple rick, and it's not just these three shows. This kind of humor is everywhere. The good place imagines an afterlife full of legal, arbitration and Algorithms. When your time on earth has ended, we calculate the total value of your life. He was saying are perfectly accurate measuring system only. The people with the very highest scores, the true cream of the crop got to come here to the good price.

Speaker 1:          07:20          One Punch man imagined super heroing as a dumb bureaucratic game mired in red tape and the sleeper hit soon to be TV. Show what we do in the shadows envisions frightening vampires fighting over banal roommate issues. Vampires don't do dishes to return to Berkson. If we find all this funny, it's because we're confronted with a mirror of our own lives. More than just laughing at bodies as machines, we laugh when we imagine people as mere instruments have a greater machine. Bergson gives the example of a person who performs their duty, not like a human, but like a machine. He cites a story he found in a newspaper. A large steamer was wrecked off the coast of France after courageously rushing to save the passengers. The customs officers didn't ask if the survivors were okay, but rather immediately asked if they had anything to declare. The customs officers were not acting as humans, but mere instruments have a larger bureaucracy, and this is exactly what shows like archer Gary and his demons and sometimes rick and morty rely on how we've become near instruments have a larger game.

Speaker 2:          08:23          We know how you feel. We're working. Our assembly line is justice.

Speaker 1:          08:28          It puts on display the inclusivity between the way we imagine the world ought to be and the way it really is because of this discrepancy. We no longer live in a world where we can stomach the cheery idealism of heroes past, but have to deconstruct the fantasy at every turn because our fantasies have been deconstructed. We can't imagine much of anything without wanting to think of what is pulling its strings. Take these superhero one liner, one say, source of Catharsis. If it got motherfucker, it now needs to be exposed as a tired cliche. So we get this

Speaker 4:          09:00          table for one. Want to try? Want to try one more time? Um, this guy's cut off

Speaker 1:          09:07          beause you know this. You should know that as an original and this Gillette, she'd be ready with the transdermal solution of the most powerful laxative known to man. Damn man, I had something for this. Marvel movies can't sell superheroes without constantly undercutting the seriousness of what they're doing.

Speaker 4:          09:26          We know other. He's a friend from work

Speaker 1:          09:29          pools, one of the most popular superheroes by virtue of not being a hero at all, and things like cinema since draw humor from subjecting films to a level of cold, hard logic that they weren't even built for. This leads us to the second marker of modern humor, a broken protagonist. Now this certainly isn't new. Jerry Seinfeld did it over 20 years ago, but instead of looking up to burt reynolds, now admire a broken version of burt reynolds or a broken van, helsing or a broken doc brown. And then there's something like, it's always sunny in Philadelphia, a show that according to create or Glenn Howerton shows what the American dream looks like when you fail. Even the notion of doing good deeds, his shadow on relishing in the collateral damage that often comes with being a quote. Good guy are demon hunter amputates an orphan by accident and tries to be a nicer person before realizing it's pointless.

Speaker 2:          10:20          You came, oh, I knew you cared about me. You are a good guy.

Speaker 1:          10:26          Similarly, morty tries to save an interdimensional being from assassination only to discover it wants to exterminate all life. Carbon based life is a threat tool I allies to us. You are what you would call a disease and has to kill it himself. Rick highlights the futility of do gooding when he says, what about the reality where Hitler cured cancer? Morty, the answer is don't think about it. And the entire premise of archer is to explore these self obsessed eccentricities of the people who are supposed to keep us safe at night. To summarize, we were promised jet packs and hover boards. And because we never got them, we have no fantasies, no heroes, and some serious skepticism about doing good. And now the best sense of pleasure we can get is collectively reflecting on that sense of disappointment. Now, that's not to say we're completely without dreams. Instead of dreaming of Nicer cars and the perfect relationship, which shirt definitely still happens. We also get gratification by relishing in the utterly mundane.

Speaker 2:          11:24          Would you rather get embroiled in a particularly nasty Ponzi scheme or go on a date with trevor from school?

Speaker 1:          11:33          Things like the Roy game or this are barely even science fiction. She's obsessed with her new virtual bouncer game.

Speaker 2:          11:40          Real fun. You on the list? Nice tripe house to the back of the line.

Speaker 1:          11:44          Is it any different than the wildly popular job simulator game where one pretends to be a robot, poorly reenacting mundane office work or clicker games, but is everything hopeless? Of course not. Yes we wise crackers can sometimes seem like curmudgeons, but hey, that's what happens when you read philosophy, Bro. But I promise there's still hope like my dog. What do you look at? Dead baby phase muffin man. Oh, or for instance, I went to this place that took my two favorite sauces, hummus and garlic sauce, and turned it into one sauce. It pretty much shattered my worldview.
