Speaker 1:          00:08          Hey, wise crack. Jared here. For those of you following ourself, park podcast, respect or authortalk. You know, we've been reflecting on how this season is focused more on people's reaction to our modern cultural cluster rather than the actual events themselves. Well, this week the show commented on people's reaction to something very close to our hearts. South Park itself. It makes me feel old saying this, but many of you may not remember a little movie called South Park, bigger, longer, and uncut because it's almost 20 years old. This episode artfully echoes the movie, but this time things are a little different. Is southpark showing signs of a moral crisis? Well, let's find out for those of you who aren't caught up on this season, kyle falls for carbons, girlfriend, Heidi. But after a brief flirtation, Heidi cakes, kyle to the curb, returns to Cartman sweaty, stubby, armed embrace, it starts to match her bloated bow right down to his trademark. Assholery Jag, a special needs science fair. No thanks. Let's start the discussion with Heidi and Hartman brawling in the hallway while goes to break up the fight and of course everyone hates that he ruined the fun.

Speaker 2:          01:11          Shut up, Kai. You sound like your mom.

Speaker 1:          01:14          From that point on, kyle is the butt of a thousand jokes and tell. He thinks he's figured out what's caused such a culture of meanness at school. His former favorite show, terrence and fill up those two Canadians have kept on farting into old age and have even tooted their way into a brand new netflix original series. The new show is a hit, but kyle hates it because having been a metaphorically farted on in school, he finds himself sympathizing with the people getting farted on in the show for the first time. I feel kind of bad for the person being farted on rather than letting those loose bowel loonies continue poisoning the hearts and minds of children. Heile takes a stand. You're organizes an activist group called millennials against Canada. His protest leads him to shutting down the show and eventually it goes all the way to the president.

Speaker 1:          02:00          Garrison tells kyle to stop the protest, but he won't and kyle eventually gets garrison literally turned on drew's. I've got a little chubb by the idea of Nuking Canada. Now with that plot. Sounds familiar. Congratulations. You like us, have watched a lot of south park. Turns out those jokes about kyle being like his mom were just empty insults. Kyle's protest mirrors the behavior of his mother in south park bigger, long for an uncut, just as Sheila created mothers against Candida to protest the obscenity of the terrance and Philip movie. Hile has created millennials against Canada to protest terrence and Phillips and new Netflix show. The parallels are more than just conceptual. They lift entire scenes from the movie.

Speaker 2:          02:39          We can't believe that a movie was some foul language would piss you off summer please. Can I finish? Okay, I bet that's how you know. How can I bet? Because you were all waste on it yourself. Please. Can I finish? All right. I finished

Speaker 1:          02:57          on one level. This is south way of playfully comparing millennial hostility toward offensive media to the parents of the 90s who blamed issues like drug use and columbine on everything from heavy metal to south park. But there's something else going on here. The South Park movie features a movie within a movie, terrorists and Philip asses a fire. It was a metal stand in for the South Park movie itself. Just as Kyle and company, we're witnessing a cruder r rated version of an already obscene TV show. We the audience were similarly consuming a cruder r rated version of an already obscene TV show while parents were protesting southpark in real life. Parents in the movie protested terrence and Philip. The Canadian duo has always been a riff on how people who've never watched south park characterize the show is nothing but Barton poop jokes. The thinking is South Park is far from terrance and fill up these days. South Park has gotten increasingly topical and specific over the years with the occasional returned to their roots.

Speaker 2:          03:58          Alexa, add big hairy baths. Do My shopping list. Okay. I've added big hairy balls to your shopping list.

Speaker 1:          04:05          That means that old tariffs and Philip, despite sharing initials with South Park Creator Trey Parker, aren't a perfect parallel to the show itself, but the idea that both shows are objects of both love and scorn in their respective universes holds up. So with carrots and Philip acids have higher. Matt and Trey were asking us to go along with them as they wonder about their place in the cultural landscape where they to blame back then, their answer was a resounding no. Now, in the turbulent times of 2017 they're doing it again, but this time the answer up to whether or not they're implicated in society's ills is not so clear. Once Kyle realizes that the person getting farted on has feelings too, he finds the show cruel and offensive. On one hand, Kyle's growing distance from terrance and Philip is a commentary on how millennials new found awareness has rendered old school south park humor no longer relevant, which leaves Matt and Trey Feeling as old as terrorists and Philip look, on the other hand, this is the beginning of the show's attempt at self evaluation. Heile takes his concern to the new vice principal, strong woman.

Speaker 3:          05:07          There's a culture at the school and they didn't break his meanness and I believe now it comes from a Canadian TV show. All the boys watch it. I did too. We all laugh while they fart innocent people's heads. The thing is, I never felt for the person being farted on until now.

Speaker 1:          05:24          There's no shortage of things, pieces that suggests that south park may have fostered this culture of meanness, but strong woman disagrees.

Speaker 2:          05:32          You want to blame farts? That seems kind of ridiculous, doesn't it? I mean, it's a slippery slope when we start pointing the finger for our own shortcomings.

Speaker 1:          05:43          She's making a very salient point here, one that we can dig deeper into by again, returning to bigger, longer and uncut as the war with Canada rages. Kyle runs into his mother. She says it was all for him, but kyle doesn't see it that way. I, I'm doing very important

Speaker 3:          05:58          things, but you never took the time to talk to me. Whenever I get in trouble, you'll go up and blame everybody else. But I'm the one to blame here with me.

Speaker 1:          06:07          Sheila has started an entire wars that she could avoid confronting the fact that she was simply a bad parent who didn't pay attention to what her child needed, just like his mom. Kyle brings about horrible things, not because of his principles, but because of his self absorbed motivations.

Speaker 3:          06:21          What do you like what I want to world? We've mapped, it doesn't come at someone else's expense where people can live freely without fear. Think farted on. I want a world we want ridiculed for Teigen out a world where nice girl that I liked is it turned into another Eric,

Speaker 1:          06:42          you're kyle admits the real reason for his actions, the shortcomings he was trying to hide. So if Sheila was protesting the terrans and Philip movie to cover her own failings as a parent, and Kyle is doing it to hide his feelings of having lost Heidi to Cartman, what does that say about South Park? The show since kyle is so often the voice of the show,

Speaker 3:          07:01          I've been thinking, how did shamelessness get to this? Did it start with that people on scooters or did the bar get lowered way before that? And then I started thinking maybe it was us, I don't know, but maybe somehow we lower the bar a long time ago and now we're all sitting here in this. Think of it all.

Speaker 1:          07:22          Well maybe it's this, maybe kyle sadness at losing Heidi who has basically turned into a female version of cartman antisemitism in all mirrors, Matt and trey sadness at creating a show that may have spawned a few real life Cartman's they've always prided themselves on making fun of everyone equally, but now do they just come off like out of touch old people farting on minorities?

Speaker 3:          07:45          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          07:50          Now just to be clear, I love South Park and hate censorship. Put this critical look in the mirror also reflects the show's identity crisis after a failed attempt at full on satirical serialization. We're now in the midst of a season full of ups and downs and a mix of tones. The episodes range from terrance and Philip's style fart jokes to failed political satires two successful ones and episodes that don't make a lot of sense. Should they be a political show? Don't even want to, can he still be funny if people are now concerned that people are farting on half feelings, are we truly in a post funny era of satire knowing that Matt and Trey find a lot of 2017 to be miserable just like the rest of us. It's interesting that unlike bigger, longer and uncut they aren't giving themselves a free pass. Now we don't know how that evaluation is going to play out, but the episode ends on a real cliffhanger.

Speaker 1:          08:39          What comes after the bombs land on Canada? Well we'll just have to twiddle our fingers until the season finale. So what do you think wise crack. Do you think the show is getting Maudlin in its old age looking back on its past like a bleary-eyed former football state champion or do Matt and Trey just not give it? Maybe we're overthinking it either way. Let us know what you think and as always peace. Thanks for watching wise crack. One thing you can never overthink is your website.
