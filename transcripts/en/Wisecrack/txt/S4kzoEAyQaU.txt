Speaker 1:          00:17          Greetings and welcome to earthlink cinema. I am your host Garrick's, where amyloid. This week's artifact is American psycho. Based on the book by Bret Easton, Ellis island storing weight loss guru Christian Bale. The film takes place in 1989. Give or take a millennium. Our protagonist is human investment banker, Patrick Batman, and he's got it all. I'll legally blonde girlfriend, two layers of skin and a brain disease that makes them old murdery. One day his work friend, jared Letterman, gets his driver's license, making Patrick's Learner's permit. Look, admittedly pretty condemned to bury the hatchet. He invites him over for some rhythm of the night and buries the hatchets. Patrick leaves a facetime audio cover up and a grossly inaccurate terminator. Impression, baby. Pretty soon, Norman Osborn starts asking questions about Letterman's disappearance from late night, if only to inject some plot. Luckily, he's not really into facts will just disappear and they leave it at that. Later that night, Patrick asks, too lovable prostitutes to star in his porno Chitty Chitty Bang Bang and wraps production. After the big coat hanger scene, we're not through yet. When the Hooli CEO gets his license, Patrick hops back on the murder train, but learns that he's gay and stops since that would be a hate crime to clear his head. He books the prostitute for a sequel, but totally forgets to tidy up his pad. She's such a neat freak. She leaves without taking her chainsaw, forcing patrick to throw on some clothes,

Speaker 1:          01:47          the next night. Patrick remembers his pin and forgets his cat. When a woman tries to cut in line, Batman tells her to wait and hell. The fas asked what happened, so patrick shows them he gives a janitor and security guards some time off because he's such a nice guy, and then booty calls his lawyer. Whoops. The following morning, patrick shocked to find his place spic and span decks, even though is Roomba broke forever ago. The film ends with Patrick running into his lawyer and an astonishing Pepsi twist is revealed. The lawyer doesn't charge for the our American psycho, satirizes consumer as values through its portrayal of Wall Street yuppies. Long before bitcoin became sentient and blew up Guam for Patrick and Co, meaning comes through what you own reflecting the philosophy of Herbie fully loaded. Mark, who's up in his book, one dimensional man, he writes, people recognize themselves in their commodities, in their automobile.

Speaker 1:          02:43          Hi Fi set, split level home and kitchen equipment. Personally, I recognize myself in my space, Jacuzzi, the film lampoons the trivial pursuit of status. When Batman and his colleagues compare business cards to the casual observer, they're all Comic Sans, but in Patrick's world, this becomes a tense power, struggle over the slightest distinctions. That's subtle enough. Way Coloring tasteful thing. Patrick, you're sweating. Similarly, the traders have become indistinguishable from each other. I mean, they're all mammals to me and beneath the flashy exterior, there's no substance. I simply am not the film comments on humans' preoccupation with looking mighty fine. Often on instagram. People are so obsessed with Batman, superficial qualities that they failed to notice. He's gotten a haircut. I'd like to dissect girls. Did you know I'm utterly insane. Great Tan Marcus. I mean really impressive. When Louis Sees Batman struggling with a suspicious bag, all he cares about is who designed it.

Speaker 1:          03:42          Where did you get that overnight bag? The cost of his sheets is more important than the fact that they are clearly covered in cranberry juice. I can only get these sheets in Santa Fe. These are using visual imagery. The film draws a connection between Patrick's violent tendencies and his material girl ism what appears to be droplets of blood turns out to be a supreme really decadent sauce called Saracha. Batman's call for dinner reservations is juxtaposed with some pretty hardcore pornography. Although I've seen worse when we see Batman's victims hanging in the closet like Valentino suits, we realized that to him, human beings have been reduced to a mere commodities and a bold fashion statements. As Patrick's behavior grows more erratic, we begin to wonder how much of this documentary is real when he visits letterman's apartment, rather than encountering bodies and blood soaked walls, he meets only a realtor and a crazy low asking price, and as lawyer appears to contradict his confession, I killed. That's simply not possible. Why isn't it possible? Because I had dinner with Paul Island twice in London just 10 days ago. These disparities could suggest Batman's world is so jaded towards money. A realtor would whitewash a murder house to get a good zillow. It could also suggest Batman. Story is a fantasy, a warning that in such a culture, the potential for maniacal violence could lurk inside any of them,
