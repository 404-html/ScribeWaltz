Speaker 1:          00:00          Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:02          a wise crack. Did somebody. Jared here, I'm here today to talk to you about an issue of grave importance, a dark stain on our generation, the Emoji movie. Now you probably all know most of the reasons to hate the Emoji movie. It served as a family friendly vessel to cram as many shameless product placements as 90 minutes can fit. It's also predictable, painfully unfunny and tries to convey a moral message as gracefully as this.

Speaker 2:          00:29          There's another reason you should hate the Emoji movie. It's politics and that's because while it tries to tell a story about inclusivity, it's so poorly thought out. That advantage is not only to fail at being inclusive, but accomplishes the exact opposite, presenting us with a hopeless totalitarian nightmare. Seriously, welcome. This wise crack addition on the Emoji movie, what went wrong, and just in case anyone gives us spoilers ahead, but first a recap. The emoji movie takes place in Tech. Stopple is a city of 70 into emojis. Inside some kid named Alex his phone gene, a Emoji decides to stop mooching off his parents and get a job in boating for his human overlord problem is he has trouble maintaining his madness, expressing a range of emotions instead, but since being met is his function, he says, job up gets labeled a malfunction

Speaker 1:          01:20          if you have expressions other than function

Speaker 2:          01:25          and evades deletion from the text Apolis Fas, as the movie drags on his antics threatened to kill him and everyone he loves. Once Alex tires have issues,

Speaker 1:          01:34          wireless wireless, I'd like to make an appointment.

Speaker 2:          01:38          This phone is playing games with me. He's just scape is assisted by princess turned hacker and a high five who loves to dance. Alex decides to wipe his broken phone.

Speaker 1:          01:47          I wanted to leave everything to it.

Speaker 2:          01:50          Jean witnesses the deaths of all his friends, which is definitely his fault. He manages to malfunction with confidence and grace, allowing Alex to properly mack on some girl.

Speaker 1:          02:00          That's super cool. Emoji.

Speaker 2:          02:02          In the end, Alex is happy with his broken phone because it's made him a mack daddy and gene gets to express himself however he pleases the end. The emoji movie is certainly trying to espouse a noble message that we are not bound by tradition or birth and can become whatever we want. It's not a new trope. The nobles overcome their birth name for her bidden love a warrior who wants to fight in spite of societal expectations or pretty much any story where someone packed their bags to escape their small town existence or the big city lifestyle. It's an easy enough concept. One, you'd have to try really, really hard to botch and with that, the movie botched literally every single opportunity to sell that message so much so it's worth discussing. Before we get into the totalitarian stuff. First there's jailbreak, a princess Emoji by birth, but she'd rather do cool hacker stuff like wearing beanies and watching Mr. robot, instead of doing princess stuff throughout film, she assists gene and escaping to the cloud. Innovating deletion. She eventually saves the day by throwing away the hacker costume, reverting to a princess and whistling for the twitter bird.

Speaker 2:          03:11          In other words, you can grow up to be anything you want, but when push comes to shove, you're going to have to sacrifice who you are in order to become what society always expected of you. It kind of be like the plot of Milan, but if Milan saved the day by going home and cooking her father, a nice dinner before folding his laundry, then there's gene who was born a man Emoji, but it's capable of laughing and screaming and having sweet glasses. He faces discrimination by not falling in line with the identity society has put out for him, but a conversation between genes. Parents reveals that his father has the same malfunction, suggesting that gene's malfunction is gene netic. Get it. Jean,

Speaker 2:          03:50          regardless of whether or not emojis have DNA, the idea that genes whole identity is inherited, further undercuts the message that society and birth shouldn't dictate what we aspire to be and because bad decisions apparently come in threes to further cement the message that we all contain some innate, inescapable nature. By birth, the high five Emoji reminds us why he has to press buttons. It's a big red button and eventually saves the day by performing the task he was born to do. Now, that's not to say the movie can't be trying to teach people to have confidence in the things they can't change about themselves, but it also manages to more or less demonstrate that you can achieve greatness if your genetics allow. It also manages to turn Internet trolls, who in real life are horrible people by their own volition into an identity that one is born into and therefore can not choose Emoji.

Speaker 2:          04:46          I thought the conversation just got dahmer. Internet trolls, just ignore them so instead we get the equivalent of a racial underclass subject to constant denigration, so much for inclusion, but even if we wanted to concede that the emoji movie really was about being comfortable in your identity, there's another scarier problem. It offers us a vision of the future. That to paraphrase George Orwell's 19, 84 is pretty much a boot stamping on an Emoji face forever. On one level, the Emoji movie shows us an authoritarian nightmare. In it's emphatic, fewer smiler emojis are put into the service of the messaging APP and anything that interferes with the functioning of that APP must be eliminated. While gene supposedly overthrows this order by flaunting his God given talents, what can we infer really happened to text opolis afterwards to figure that out, we need a little help from German philosopher Max Horkheimer Horkheimer wrote extensively about an idea called instrumental rationality or instrumental reason and believe that played a crucial role in the domination of humanity throughout the 20th century, especially into solitary and regimes.

Speaker 2:          05:49          Instrumental rationality is the kind of reason we use to achieve a particular end. If I've decided the wise crack team needs to eat, 50 pounds of pizza. Instrumental reason can help me figure out the best, most efficient way for them to build their bodies with regret. Drink lots of water the day before. Go for the toppings with high water content. Smoke lots of Ganja, but instrumental rationality is dangerous because it doesn't ask bigger questions like, why am I trying to destroy my body? Or why in God's name did I just spend $300 on pizza? And while Horkheimer wasn't talking about pizza or other everyday uses of practical reason, he noted that modern society was fueled by this flawed kind of rationality, always figuring out the fastest way to get somewhere, never trying to figure out if it was even worth it at all. Texts apolis seems to be run on this kind of instrumental rationality.

Speaker 2:          06:38          The whole society is organized for one purpose to deliver Alex the emojis. He selects here. Each of us does one thing and we have to nail it every time. There are never questions like, why does Alex get to pick the Emoji? Or Hey, isn't this technically slavery? And there's good reason if they go on strike outs will probably uninstalled the APP and murder them all. See, this is the problem with anthropomorphizing utilities in films where there are humans present. It's cute at first, but when you think about it, it gets pretty horrified. The problem with instrumental rationality for Horkheimer is that it aids in the domination of humanity since it's concerned with questions like efficiency and usefulness, both nature and humanity become inputs in the assembly line of society. As we reduced our inner nature to instrumental functions, we lose any strong sense of self and thus lack the inner substance in a manner that makes us metaphorically into nobody's and when everyone is reduced to a use value, things get even scarier.

Speaker 2:          07:38          It's for this reason that Horkheimer and his fellow Frankfurt school thinkers characterize the totalitarianism of the 19 thirties as the ultimate danger of the instrumental rationality that pervades our modern world. We see the totalitarian danger of this everywhere in the Emoji movie society is organized based on how individual emojis can be instrumentalized in the surface of Alex. emojis are used often get to go to the cool parties and are popular with peers while those unused get sent to the loser lounge and those that disturb the peace. As with gene get liquidated and while the existential threat of getting deleted, they sound like good rationalization for killing gene. It's also worth noting that most authoritarian regimes sell their message through existential threats. You know the whole, it's either this or the demise of the German people stick, so it was gene's victory in the climax of the film, a blow against the authoritarian terror of smiler. Well, no. Yes, Jean is a revered hero. High five is popular again, and the exclusive vip parties of the old regime are now open to all from now on.

Speaker 3:          08:42          Welcome. What is all this? It's for you Jane. However,

Speaker 2:          08:48          in the after credit scene, we see smuggler relegated to the loser lounge confirming a sill existing between usable and unusable emojis, but for Horkheimer, this shouldn't be much of a surprise as he writes what is usually indicated as a goal. The happiness of the individual health wealth gains at significance exclusively from its functional potentiality. In other words, the happiness of everyone in text opolis is only significant in that Alex is texting app still works. Nothing is solved in regards to the extreme instrumental rationality of textile pollutes. Emojis are still instrumentalized for Alex, and if gene's malfunction is now popular, it's only by the whims of their human overlord. We even get an Emoji dance where emojis are seemingly free to emote as they pleased, but this expressiveness is only permissible in so far as it doesn't threaten Alex's social prowess, and because the film hints that gene's malfunction is inherited, the implication is a new dystopia where those with a quasi genetic mutation can better serve Alex.

Speaker 2:          09:49          while those born of lesser genes can still be discarded. So while we may have thought that the end of smilers regime would have meant liberation of emotions and text Apolis, the fact that Alex is still the ultimate judge of functionality means nothing has changed. Basically, the Emoji still live under the iron fist of Alex because nothing has been done to undermine their instrumentalization. What will become of gene when Alex tires have is ultimately meaningless? Emoting one day he may decide to do away with whatever money, eyes slash kissing face slash sunglasses, emoji means and go straight for the eggplant Emoji. As if to foreshadow this high five tells us early in the film

Speaker 4:          10:26          what you need off fans. They give you complete an unrelenting support as long as you're on top.

Speaker 2:          10:34          And here's the issue with making emojis, which are things with an actual function, a metaphor for humans who are more than a utility on a smartphone APP, it makes a lot more sense to delete and Emoji for not doing its job than murdering a human for not doing its job in textile apolis. If the system truly goes too far, Alex can just get another phone that's not exactly how human civilization works. And here we can see the shift in how domination happens. Whereas 100 years ago, the system enforced its rules with repression like smilers, our modern society strengthen their rule with liberation or at least liberation within bounds. As fellow Frankfurt School Herbert marcuse or wrote, many of the freedoms afforded to western civilization only served to make the repression of those societies more efficient. We're given the freedom of how to exist within the system, but never the freedom to escape the system.

Speaker 2:          11:26          The Post almost apocalypse world of text habilis certainly seems more permissive, but what has been omitted from the story is the possibility of escape. Jailbreak once resisted the system by escaping it, living outside the APP, but now she's back in text apolis in full princess the tire. The cloud then represents the ultimate resistance to the system which has been brushed aside by the film and jeans. Heroics have only served to perpetuate this cruel system is the ultimate of the Emoji movie. Resistance is futile, were either subjugated by strict totalitarian regime or we get to express ourselves freely, so long as it serves the same master in either case, freedom is an illusion and your inescapably a pawn in the system g you all, and thanks for watching. Peace.

Speaker 5:          12:10          Yes. What we have business to attend to. What kind of business monkey business. British,
