Speaker 1:          00:00          This video is brought to you by wix. Let's talk about Kanye West. The years 2009 at the MTV video music awards killer. Swift wins an award over beyonce and you might remember what happened next. I'll let you finish of the best videos of all time. Goes on to apologize and then apologize and it all gets very confusing. Fast forward to 2016 and Kanye track famous features. This slide

Speaker 2:          00:30          appeal like me and Taylor, my still as sex. Why I made that famous, I made that.

Speaker 1:          00:37          It's famous. The Internet got mad. Taylor swift got mad and then audio comes out that Taylor swift knew about and even encouraged the song from the start. Me and Taylor might still have six.

Speaker 3:          00:50          Yeah, I mean, and I really appreciate you telling me about it. That's really nice.

Speaker 1:          00:59          Wait, what? Well, this seemingly insignificant example perfectly explained our current cultural and political predicament and it all has to do with a concept from professional wrestling called, believe it or not, if we pay attention to these guys will be able to better understand what's going on with these guys. If we're right, it might be the case that wrestling truly can explain everything. Welcome to the wide world of Kayfabe, but before we get into it and want to give a shout out to our sponsor over at Wix, if you've ever thought about creating your own website, which will give you total creative freedom to make a professional and engaging website for any occasion, we even whipped up a site using their cool community features so you guys can vote on what kind of content you want us to make. Next. More on that at the end of the video, but for now, back to the show. So what is it's a term used to describe the way in which professional wrestling consists of staged events and predetermined narratives that are treated as true. So even though everyone knows that wrestling is scripted, they still treat it like a real athletic competition. And even when wrestlers are off the clock and out of the ring, they never acknowledged this as this would constitute the unholy sin known as breaking Kayfabe. You never break Kayfabe

Speaker 1:          02:18          the put this commitment to Kayfabe into perspective. This would basically be like if Matt Damon refused to accept his drink at starbucks, unless the Barista called out the name Jason Bourne. Now wrestling fans aren't idiots. They of course know that the fights are scripted and that the wrestlers are characters, but it's not the truth of the events that matter. It's the story. It's not true because it's real. It's true because it's entertaining. It's still, hey, doesn't just apply to any reality show that may or may not be true. You as this would make 90 percent of modern entertainment Kayfabe. Instead, Kayfabe refers who entertainment in which staged events are presented as real by those producing them and perceived as real by those consuming them. It's kind of like Santa Claus. Everyone knows he's fake, but because we're all in on it,

Speaker 1:          03:13          and this time we agree with you Dwayne, and in case any kiddos are watching this, don't be upset while Santa Claus is a lie, so is God, so remove the shackles from your tiny souls and dare to live a life beyond good and evil, but much like John Cena, Kayfabe didn't stick to just wrestling for long and in a manner reminiscent of Dwayne Johnson himself. Hey, faith has now infected the entire entertainment industry and as we'll soon see our lives and while professional wrestling is unsurprisingly full of Floridians. Another famous floridian has used Kayfabe in a seemingly unlikely medium rap music. Rick Ross, who is basically the Santa Claus of Miami,

Speaker 4:          03:53          goes on the phone with June. The static DC coming,

Speaker 1:          03:58          has built a career on the narrative that he's a legendary Boston, the drug game comparing himself to enthuse kingpins and countless songs. However, pictures leaked, which revealed that the boss with a belly full of Rosa spent his younger years as a corrections officer. So rather than ducking the law, Rick Ross was enforcing it. Many assumed this would be the end of his career.

Speaker 5:          04:26          How do you feel about Boston giving you an officer Reiki? I just want to hear it from you. Maybe I'm worth too much money to even be side tracked on his copy, but

Speaker 1:          04:38          it had very little effect. Ross responded with a fakeness that would make a French new wave fan proud about who rosa is. This about me, when anywhere I go and I step in the room, I put it down. People know this. Authentic right here they know is real, so this go get this money. Let's make this music and his career has only grown since Kayfabe can help us understand this as the fans prefer the narrative of Ross as a Miami drug kingpin over the truth of his career in law enforcement and why would Ross care what's true and what's not? As long as he's selling records, we can see another use of Kayfabe in the world of Youtube. Most infamous brothers Bill Paul in a move that would likely confused Rick Ross. The two brothers often engage in a back and forth beef via youtube videos, along with making Aaron Carter look hardcore by comparison. Thirty four slash seven from this battle can be best to analyze as a clever use of Kayfabe to gain the youtube algorithm to get the brothers and more clicks and more dollars and just in case Rick Ross is watching this, rick, we will gladly send you a free, wise crack Hoodie if you post your own rap video that shuts the Paul's up once and for all, and for us did this. It would make him a shooter, which is a cafe term for someone who makes the and wrestling

Speaker 6:          05:58          real. Before we go on. It's worth noting how Kayfabe is also distinct from satire, while for both the performer

Speaker 1:          06:04          and the audience are in on the joke. Satire is used precisely to point us toward the absurdity of the actual truth rather than create a new one. For example, Stephen Colbert engaged in satire on the Colbert report.

Speaker 6:          06:17          I don't even see race, not even my own. People tell me I'm white and I believed them because I just devoted six minutes to explaining how I'm not a racist,

Speaker 1:          06:27          as his character was used to exemplify the absurdity of cable news. Host Bill O'reilly, but Info wars host Alex Jones can be better analyze via Kayfabe.

Speaker 6:          06:36          I'm a pioneer. I'm an explorer. I'm a human and I'm coming

Speaker 1:          06:42          is insane. Claims are always presented in the guise of political truth and the audience buys into the narrative. The cold air and O'reilly example can help us understand another set of terms used by Kayfabe faces and heals faces referred to the good guys in wrestling and heels are the bad guys, and while we might outwardly route for the faces, the heels are the ones who sell the tickets. This can help explain the polarization of the media. Heels are where the money is, so o'reilly and Co had their heel and Obama.

Speaker 6:          07:11          What President Obama does not understand is that he has lost all credibility in matters of security

Speaker 1:          07:17          and now the liberal media has found their ultimate heal in trump. What he saying was not true. Now you might be thinking that if Kayfabe only applies to the media, then why should I care? Well, we think that Dwayne, it absolutely does matter because the terrifying reality is that Kayfabe is an even better tool for understanding contemporary politics. Uh, Twenty Sixteen New York Times article by Jeremy Gordon was titled, is everything wrestling, which we might rephrase as is our world becoming one elaborate Kayfabe take Alex Jones, while he's known for his subtle political arguments,

Speaker 6:          07:53          destroy the corrupt them all. This is their plan people. These are demons

Speaker 1:          07:59          and stellar advertising campaigns for legit medical supplements. Heat recently used to his defense in a court of law

Speaker 6:          08:06          attorney Randal willhite said Jones is playing a character on his radio show.

Speaker 1:          08:12          Just claim doesn't change the fact that his show is considered a new source by his millions of viewers. And yes, it can be fun to play with this persona. I'm not a Democrat either. I'm an idealist, but the pizzagate scandal shows the dark side of Jones. His brand of political Kayfabe. Kayfabe isn't just being used for the type of fringe media being kicked off youtube. It's all over TV news as well. CNN has acknowledged that their primary aim is not objective news, but rather entertainment. According to a New York Times profile of CNN, President Jeff Zucker as Zucker sees it, his pro trump panelists are not just spokespeople for a worldview. They are characters in a drama. Members of CNNS extended ensemble cast. Michelle Wolf recently out how much cable news depends on heels and constructed narratives.

Speaker 7:          08:58          Watching the host act like the guest forced his way into the studio is so compelling, you almost forget that he was invited on.

Speaker 1:          09:08          Finally, the biggest example of political kayfabe might be the 45th president of the United States, Donald J dot trump. No stranger to reality TV. Trump is the first politician to fully embrace the power of Kayfabe. Trump has made a number of claims that are clearly untrue. I know more about isis than the generals do. Believe me. This was the largest audience to ever witness an inauguration period, and of course his threats against his old trend, Hillary Clinton.

Speaker 8:          09:37          It's just awfully good that someone with the temperament of Donald trump is not in charge of the law in our country because you'd be in jail.

Speaker 1:          09:46          How does much truth behind them as the beef between stone cold and the rock, but just like Rick Ross, his criminal past. It's the narrative that matters. Not the facts from maybe especially extreme in his political Kayfabe, but politicians across the spectrum use it just as much. While the Democrats have been vocal in their support for fighting against climate change. The DNC is also recently backtracked on. They're banned from taking donations from the fossil fuel lobby, but of course this won't stop their narrative of being the party of environmentalism. So why is Kayfabe having a moment? The most obvious answer is that it allows people to ground reality in narrative rather than empirical truth and who wouldn't want to leave, and an exciting story full of heroes and villains and escalating drama. As Jeremy Gordon said in the New York Times. If a story is well told, if it's history seems consistent than the machinations, putting it into place can be temporarily overlooked or turned into a fun story of their own and why not?

Speaker 1:          10:46          In the end, we're all marks for a world we want to believe it, and this brings us to our last Kayfabe vocab term of the day, mark, which is a fan who was so excited to believe, a narrative that they lose sight of it's fictional nature and treat it as real for the mark. It's not about what is true, it's about what they want to be true, and this might be the danger of Kayfabe when it turns from a principle of entertainment into a practical philosophy writer. Nick Rogers had this to say in the New York Times. Kathy isn't merely a suspension of disbelief. It his philosophy about truth itself. It rests on the assumption that feelings are inherently more trustworthy than facts. Hey, Babes. Philosophy replaces reason and objectivity in the favor of emotion and opinion, and the most dangerous part of this world of cafe is that we might not even realize that we are in fact marks of our own creation.
