Speaker 1:          00:03          Hey wise crack jared again and today we're talking about everyone's favorite drug. Addled Gandalf, Alan Moore. Alan Moore has authored many of the most acclaimed comics of all time including watchman miracle man and the killing joke and like the joker and Batman and that story more straddles the thin line between genius and insanity.

Speaker 2:          00:23          Oh, decided it might be more interesting to actually terrified them. Boy going completely mad and declared myself to be a magician.

Speaker 1:          00:32          He calls himself a ritual magician, not the kind that pulls Ravitz from hats, but these Stephen strange variety that consults grimoires and conjures demons seriously at first glance. Much of what more means by magic seems more like the superstitions of a man hitting his corn cob wizard pipe a little too hard, but if we take more seriously for a bit, there's a pretty fascinating philosophy at play here. So what can we learn from a guy who claims he tried to end the world? Well, we're going to have to dive into a little known and even less understood a cult tradition known as hermeticism welcome us. Wise crack addition on the philosophy of Alan Moore. Today's topic is magic real. There's a ton more to cover however, so if you want more,

Speaker 1:          01:19          let us know in the comments. But first a quick shout out to our sponsor hymns who allows men to turn to science rather than magic when it comes to hair loss. Hims is a personalized and private online way for men to get access to medical grade products and connect with real doctors. They offer solutions to treatable problems like hair loss and adult acne, so you can hopefully look like Alan Moore well into your adult years. They're also your one stop shop if you're looking for help in the boner department, they've got science based treatments for Ed and since 18 to 40 year old men are less likely than any other group to visit the doctor or pharmacy, which is where you get your medicine. I'm told Hams lets you chat with real doctors all online so you never have to leave the house again. And because hymns offers generic equivalents to name brand prescriptions and direct shipment, you're getting major savings that you can use for anything.

Speaker 1:          02:08          Hims is offering wisecrack viewers a full month trial of their comprehensive haircut up to a $67 value for just five bucks while supplies last head do for him.com/wise crack or click the link below to get your discount today and now onto more. More is a student of Hermeticism, which is less a religion with set doctrines and more a set of interrelated practices and principles hermeticism. His goal is to seek understanding of the world through three methods, Alchemy, astrology and fear g. The first two are familiar enough, but the third theory is basically the process of achieving spiritual perfection with the goal of growing ever nearer to God. Hermeticism is largely based on the teachings of the Corpus Hermetic up by the mythical Hermes Trismus justice. He's a mixture of Hermes and thought both the Greek and Egyptian gods of language and wisdom respectively to more. This mixture of language and understanding is the heart of magic in his upcoming the moon and serpent bumper book of magic more defines magic as a purposeful engagement with the phenomena and possibilities of consciousness.

Speaker 1:          03:14          So what does that mean? Essentially Morris saying that what we call reality can be broken up into two categories. Who material and the immaterial. The material is all the physical stuff matter and energy, space and time, fundamental forces, all that, but we never experienced those things directly. Photons hit our retina, pressure, waves, impact or eardrums. Those signals get sent to our brains and based on that limited sensory information, the brain makes a mental model of what it perceives the external world to be like. That mental model is the immaterial to understand how the material and immaterial affect each other in profound ways. Let's think of watchman more had an ephemeral idea in his head for a story, but it wasn't until artist Dave gibbons gave the idea form by penciling in those panels that it achieved a four. Moore's intangible thought had a tangible effect on the arrangement of the atoms that became watchman.

Speaker 1:          04:10          The opposite is true as well. You're picturing in your mind's eye, doctor Manhattan statuesque and uncensored Azor Fallis for no other reason than because I mentioning it, the physical sound of my voice has altered your perception by conjuring that image in your mind. I cast a genuine spell to more. That's all magic is magic bridges the divide between the material and the immaterial art language symbols. These are the real wizards wants per more magic is intrinsically connected with art, language and consciousness to the point where these four things almost become different aspects of the same phenomenon. This same principle as seen in the rabbit duck illusion. At first glance you see either a rapid or a duck. Just because someone's mind initially interpreted as duck doesn't mean that meaning is fixed. All it takes is for someone to tell them it's also a rabbit and all of a sudden it changes right before their eyes.

Speaker 1:          05:06          It's storytelling as spell craft. Just as storytelling can be used to cast illusions. It can likewise dispel them as an anarchist. More counts money among the more destructive illusions to ever distort mankind's collective conscious. When miracle man tasks himself with making earth a utopia among the first things he does is abolish money. Suddenly announcing money is a promise to redeem the cache of every bearer for its worth in gold or merchandise and empty promise. Should we all demand at once redemption of our coins, we learned such wealth does not exist. Monies imaginary real. If we believe in it, come summer money won't exist, but then it never did. This method of magically altering something by changing the way you think is most clearly seen in promethium. A notable example happens when protagonists has a rematch with the demon king as modus initially and co are set on slaying asthma day in anger, but it's only when they accept that so called demons are just a part of human nature.

Speaker 1:          06:09          The worst parts that as modus is appearance shifts to that of a human. He explains, approached us with fear, with hatred and revulsion and we will be fearsome, hateful, and while approaches humanely and with respect and we will be human and respectable for the magician, expectation creates perspective. Even doctor Manhattan is a magician in this sense. He externally appears as an ageless aqua marine adonis with alopecia solely because this is how he internally perceives himself. So if a sufficiently compelling story can magically change our perception of a single phenomenon, what happens if we tell a story that tries to account for all the phenomenon in existence more does exactly that in promethium telling a story about everything as a spell to change our perceptions about everything. Of course, we can never quite wrap our heads around the infinite expanse of all space time, but we don't need to.

Speaker 1:          07:04          One of her medicines, his most famous principles is something called macrocosm and microcosm expressed in the Maxim as above. So below this principle presumes that every level of reality reflects every other like an infinite fractal or like how everything wrong with youtube can be distilled down to Logan, Paul and all the worst things about Logan Paul or echo throughout youtubes, other channels. Being able to understand one part of the pattern allows you to better understand the whole and in turn move from lower levels to higher levels. With promethium. The entire structure of the series is deliberately based upon a specific structure that repeats at macro, cosmic and micro cosmic levels from entire neve existence to each individual soul, the Kabbalah tree of life. For more the tree of life is the roadmap to all reality, including our inner lives. At the bottom rung is mere perception.

Speaker 1:          07:58          Seeing the rabbit or duck above that is imagination. The ability to make mental models of things not directly apprehended with our senses. Above that is our capacity for art and language. You build lead to tie ideas to sound symbols, pictures and stories and above that our capacity for emotion and reason respectively. At the macroscopic level, the physical universe is the basis sphere of the world. Soul. Above that is everyone's collective unconscious and at the very top of the tree is what early her medicines called the all the one God. That's why premia is 32 issues long corresponding to the 10 spheres and 22 paths of the tree of life added together. The story itself ends at issue 31 so he wrote a 32nd issue itself, 32 pages with each page expounding upon one of the paths. Thus, the issue was a deliberate microcosm of the series as a whole and the series a macrocosm of the issue or as above.

Speaker 1:          08:56          So below another hermetic principal used by more is solve at Coagula or separate and combined basically breaking a thing down into its component parts to better understand how the whole fits together. Dr Manhattan's are in watchman is all about him learning solve at Coagula. When we first meet him, he expresses an understanding of the first half separate better than anyone else. He's detached from humanity because he's mentally broken humans down into their base components, not unlike his father did with watches. His breakthrough on Mars is learning not merely to break humans down into abstract arrangements of atoms.

Speaker 3:          09:33          In my opinion, the existence of life is highly over right, this phenomenon, but

Speaker 1:          09:40          rather to conceptually recombine and perceive them as holistic. Four dimensional objects solve at Coagula is seen even more clearly in the sixth issue of promethium. Sophie finds herself inside humanity's collective imagination and faces off with writer Marto Nip Tura the pseudonym for a writer of the promethium character as a writer, nip turns power over the land of fiction is nearly absolute. Sophie is only able to defeat him by understanding that nip Turo was the collective pen name of various novelists. Cut Down to is separate unique styles. So if a compelling story can change one's view of the world, what happens when a story is so complete a model of the world that it changes the perception of our entire species for more. When everyone's way of viewing the world one way ends, the world ends in promethium. This is exactly the task that's sophie has given Margaret, one of the prometheans before Sophie explains, humans are amphibious.

Speaker 1:          10:37          That means they live in two worlds at once. Matter and mind promethium makes people more aware of the fast, immaterial realm. Maybe tempts them to explore it. Imagine if too many people followed where she led. It would be like the great Devonian leap from C to land to entity slithering up the beach from one element into another from matter to mind. More believes that it was through a similar leap from matter to mind. Vet Our ideas about the world began in the first place. Representation allows for the origination of verbal language with this sound or this collection of mark. Somehow also standing for that buffalo over their language is the necessary precursor of are apparently unique form of consciousness. Humanity's first purposeful engagement with the phenomenon and possibilities of consciousness. Out of this engagement sprang almost full blown the entirety of human culture writing, painting, Song, Usic Theater, science, medicine, and even politics.

Speaker 1:          11:33          And so in the same way that this idea of the world began, it also ends in the series penultimate issues. Sophie succeeds in bringing about the apocalypse by explaining to everyone the same hermetic principles we've been talking about. Everyone now perceives the immaterial and the material worlds as equally real. But while permia bringing about the world's end within the comics more was contemplating how our world will end in a similar fashion in the 12th issue more uses the Taro to trace the history of the world from the initial quantum vacuum and God big bang, the universe into existence all the way to the coming leap to expanded consciousness more places his own doom say cock quite close to midnight, like his character roar shack carrying a sign that says the end is nigh. How near riding that issue in 1999 more predicted the end of the world as we know it would occur in 2017 when the sum total of our knowledge would double at a rate of every half second with so much new knowledge coming so quickly, our old ways of understanding the world wouldn't be able to keep up and we naturally need new ways of understanding the new world.

Speaker 1:          12:40          Those of you alive back in 2017 may recall that the world did not in fact come to an end, but before the year came and went more himself tried like his character promethium to herald the apocalypse. At the hour heat appointed in September of 2016 on the eve of his prophesized worlds in more released his magnum opus Jerusalem. If promethium was a spell, he has to magically change the minds of individual readers. Jerusalem was the ritual he performed to bring about worldwide revelation as more himself a test rather than performing a ritual to produce a successful book. The book itself is the 10 year ritual working that is intended to have a certain, hopefully beneficial effect upon the consciousness of its readership. Jerusalem seems to me to be my most sophisticated and complex, magical working thus far and certainly the most ambitious in its aims. Ambitious in its aims is an understatement.

Speaker 1:          13:36          More rights in such a way that the reader experiences the higher states of consciousness that the narrative is at the same moment describing not this similar to the way the heptopods language in a rifle profoundly affects lois lane's perception of time. This is especially evident in a chapter told from the perspective of Lucy, a joist during her confinement in an asylum in employees, the same linguistic style found in her father's novel, Finnegan's wake abounding in puns, portmanteaus and the alogia slums in order to replicate Lucy as condition more explorers. How those exhibiting certain forms of insanity might be closer to perceiving external reality than those who are deemed quote sane in watchmen. Doctor Manhattan perceives every moment of his life simultaneously a far different perception than quote sane individuals. But more like Einstein regards time as a stubbornly persistent illusion. So the fact that Manhattan is not taken in by this delusion of time makes him more sane, not less.

Speaker 1:          14:34          It's we who are deficient for perceiving only the now rather than being able to gaze upon the past, present and future. Like we might take three dimensional plane in order to get us in the habit of perceiving the dimensions which we might not initially perceive more employees solve at Coagula to language itself. Taking apart the written word into its base components, separating phonetics, how vocalized words sound from Graph Fenix, how written words appear more writes dialogue as a series of words that look like Jibberish, but when read phonetically makes sense, more forces the readers who read multiple layers of meaning in every word. For example, if you read this aloud, you get the phonetic dimension. Her father in his time maintains that we are in a universe composed of four dimensions, only three of which are naturally visible. This phonetic dimension is only one side of the techs and if it's the only part we observe, we miss out on its other possible meanings.

Speaker 1:          15:29          The jibberish is full of double Entendre, like spelling dimension in a way that resembles dementia or universe in a way that resembles loony more teaches us to read with more dimensions than we normally perceive in a text about how the universe has more dimensions than we normally perceive. It's explanation and example at the same time magically changing how our mind models of the world by changing the language with which our minds construct that model. Of course, even if everyone in the whole world did read Jerusalem and have their minds expanded by more, it doesn't necessarily follow that. We'd make the great leap from the murky waters of matter to the solid land of ideas and imagination. While more may not have managed to bring about his revelation in 2017 given his status as the most influential writer in the history of comics, his literary efforts are likely to remain influential for centuries.

Speaker 1:          16:23          So is magic real? If more is right, it's at least as real as our imagination. This is prometheans revelation that ends the world. Speaking not to any of the characters in the comic, but to you the reader. I'm an idea, but I'm a real idea. I'm the idea of human imagination, which when you think about it is the only thing we can really be certain isn't imaginary. See, I'm imagination. I'm real and I'm the best friend you ever had. Who Do you think got you? All this cool stuff. The clothes you're wearing, the room, the house, the city that you're in, everything in. It started out in the human imagination, your lives, your personalities, your whole world, all invented, all made up and there's nothing here but a funny little twist of amino acids playing a marvelous game of pretend to that list of cool stuff that imagination has given us.

Speaker 1:          17:16          We can certainly add the highly imaginative works of Alan Moore.
