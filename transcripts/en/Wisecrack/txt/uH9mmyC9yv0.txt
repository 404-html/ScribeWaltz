Speaker 1:          00:00          This video is brought to you by wix. What's up guys? Jared here. We're always getting requests from fans saying, you guys have got the cover. Insert movie TV show, video game, mean book, sarcastic joke here. We'll then enthusiastically watch it, brainstorm for a really long time and often come up empty handed. It's not that we can't think of anything. The show might hint at ideas, but not fully developed them or evidence keeps coming up refuting our argument or sometimes a show was just plain inconsistent or hey, maybe we're just too dumb to figure it out. So when it came time to look at Netflix is surreal. Retro, Futuristic Love Story. We didn't quite get where we hoped. We dug and dug and found some really cool stuff, but a cohesive philosophy of not quite so we're going to do something a bit different. We're going to go through the ideas we considered show how and when they work within the context of the show and why we ultimately decided not to go with it and hey, maybe this will serve as a foundation for you to think about the show in new ways.

Speaker 1:          01:04          This is another experiment for us, so be sure to let us know what you think in the comments and without further ado, welcome to the inaugural episode of Wise Crack Half Baked addition on superbad to maniac and yup spoilers ahead, but before we get into that, want to give a quick shout out to our sponsor.

Maniac primarily focuses on Owen milgrom and Annie Landsberg. Oh, in the schizophrenia. Black sheep of a very wealthy family, struggles with delusions of saving the world and a made up brother and a broker with a dysfunctional family, struggles with drug addiction to cope with the death of her sister and the estrangement of her mother.

Speaker 1:          02:00          They enter a highly experimental pharmaceutical study run by three doctors and a supercomputer called dirty that hopes to eradicate psychological pain by having patients identify map and ultimately confront their issues through drug induced fantasies nd and Owen's wires get crossed, causing them to inhabit each other's fantasies where they experienced whole lifetimes together, Gerd. He gets depressed up to the death of Dr. Morimoto threatening the experiment and the subjects inside the final fantasy, any comforts. The computer finds the resolve to move past her sister's death while Owen confronts the fact that his fantasy brother is just an idealized version of his crappy real brother. He saves the other patients and back in the real world, finds the confidence to stand up to his family and the end. Any friendship inspires Owen to escape from a psych ward and have faith in his ability to function or was that a fantasy?

Speaker 1:          02:54          All right. Now onto the pitches organized from best to worst for your entertainment pitch. One Don Quixote. This one is an eight out of 10. Almost good enough for video. Miguel de Savantas is modern. Classic is everywhere in Maniac. One of the fantasy scenarios even revolves around one nanny infiltrating a seance to find the fictional last, final chapter of the novel. So why this focus on an old book? Well, let's break it down. Don Quixote tells the story of Alonzo Cayetano, who become so obsessed with books about chivalry that his mind dries out. Essentially, he goes mad, which makes this line extra ironic at this time is I am healthy andy now and healthy people read books inspired by his books. Alonzo decides to become a knight errant himself. The bulk of the book follows him as he goes on wild adventures, including the one where he famously attacks windmills.

Speaker 1:          03:49          He mistakes as giant windmills happens to be the name of maniacs. Second episode, which briefly features and looking at some during the road trip that ends in her sister's death, but trust me, it gets deeper than that already. We can draw a parallel between the madness that makes don quixote one to perform heroic acts and Owen schizophrenia that makes him believe that he will save the world like Don Quixote. Oh, and can't distinguish reality from fiction. The more than that, Don Quixote inhabits a dreamlike mindspace that makes castles of ens and giants of windmills turning the regular world into a fantastic one. Similarly, the ULP treatment turns its patients sad realities into fully fledged fantasy adventures, and he's Lemur. Painting becomes a bizarre recovered. The lemur story. The copy of Don Quixote, she picks up, becomes the steel. The final chapter plot Andy and Lee watching a lord of the rings esque show becomes this, and Owen's hawk that kills Ernie verbal inspires the save the world from alien's tail.

Speaker 1:          04:49          This is madness. I love Danny. If I wasn't secret agent, I would know I was a secret agent, but perhaps the most powerful connection between the two works is the shared theme of transformation through the power of dreams. Congratulations. You're a hero. In the case of the dons delusions, he adventures so that he may reinvigorate a golden age when people were more authentic, as he says bless at the time and blessed at the centuries called by the ancients, the Golden Age, and that time women spoke their thoughts of love from the soul simply and pretentiously exactly as they thought them not searching for elaborate verbal circumlocutions to beautify them, truth and simplicity. We're unmixed with fraud, deceit and malice. Justice remained firm and sure either troubled nor offended against by patronage and self interest as today. She is so grievously tainted in troubled and persecuted. Judges did not feel themselves as they do today entitled to be tyrants.

Speaker 1:          05:49          If Don Quixote's fantasies represents his yearning for the days when people weren't full of, then one could say the ulp uses fantasy to heal a society that has been defined by isolation. As James suggest at the beginning, all levels of physics require collision and bonding in order to progress and so does the human heart, comradery, communion, family, friendship, love what have you. We're lost without connection. It's quite terrible alone. However, the world were presented is one that is tragically absent, meaningful connection. Hello, Mrs Finklestein Donovan, the first two episodes introduce a vision of New York in which people are more alienated from each other than ever. Most of the human interactions we witness are purely transactional. This is made quite literal with friend proxy, a service that provides you with someone pretending to be your friend for a fee. You're using a service that gives you pretend. Friends, I have real friends.

Speaker 1:          06:57          This is just more convenient. Then there's ad buddy where a human being pitches you a product in exchange for goods and services. It's kind of like getting free content on the Internet, but having to watch annoying. There even appears to be a market for people to escape the world entirely. Enter a void, a box that basically allows you to hibernate your life away instead of engaging with the outside world. There's also lines like this. Thank you for braving the outside world for me and the fact that a zoomy and James Sleep in isolating drawers be encroachment of consumerism into every facet of our lives is further emphasized by the omnipresence of advertisements from the ads that purchased Annie's face to the neon signs blaring through Owen's window to ad copy on bridges and maniacs New York. You can't even take a shower without being bludgeoned by ads. So Don Quixote uses fantasy to bring back an ideal era of authentic expression and maniac portrays to lonely souls, finding connection through fantasy in an era of isolation. You don't do this.

Speaker 1:          08:02          I will do this. It's important to note that in many of the ulp fantasies taking place in the real world, all the creepy retro futurist stuff seems to disappear when trying to save her Lemur. For instance, the world goes from what the eighties thought. The two thousands would look like to just the eighties, but there's an important qualification to mention here. This golden age that Don Quixote waxes poetic about never really happened. There are many characters in the book who've been mown the negative effects of chivalry books. Deeming them trash and assuring people that there was never such an idyllic time. I can swear to you that in fact this world has never seen a single one of those nights, nor any of their grandkids or their stupidities, and then don quixote is tricked into hanging up, is lance and becoming Alonzo k Hondo again, eventually renounces his madness and dies a quiet death. Similarly, Annie ends up rejecting dirties, offered to stay in the fantasy world with her sister. She accepts reality and together with Owen moves forward confidently.

Speaker 1:          09:11          The problem with this is that although it's clear that Annie's break from fantasy is considered a positive development for her character, there's more ambiguity surrounding the conclusion of Glencoe take. Are we supposed to agree with the bulk of the characters in the book who claimed that fantasy has done nothing but make him a fool? Is it good that he's no longer out adventuring or should we look at it like don't Antonio Moreno who says, may God forgive you for the damage you've done to the whole rest of the world and trying to cure the wittiest lunatic ever seen. Don't you see my dear sir, that whatever utility there might be in curing him, it could never match the pleasure he gives with his madness. So why wasn't this made into a full video? Well, despite these really great connections, what else is there to say that reality is better than being a mcmurphy?

Speaker 1:          09:57          That fantasy is a liberating force for humanity, such an exhilarating experience. It seems like the connection between the two works is that they both vaguely deal with the nature of fantasy versus reality, but not in a way that could really provide a definitive philosophical thesis pitch to Mommy, Daddy and me, Ha. I give this one a five out of 10 uptop we should mention owens name is Sergei milgrom is a reference to the milgram experiment in which subjects were given the ability to electrocute people and continue to harm them under the suggestion of an authority figure. Pretty cool. Shout out, but didn't really see how it connected to any of the events in the series. There's also some serious freud and undertones. James is a pair of fillic, meaning he's attracted to inanimate objects. You also has a strange relationship with his mother. In fact, if we want to get all oedipal and we always do, the oedipal triangle of mother, father and child seemed to be important for many of the main characters and he's mother walked out on her father.

Speaker 1:          10:58          Owen's dad is an overbearing, fascist and mantle ray also without a father in his life near drove my father away and you slept in my bed, way too much, literally goes blind after confronting his mother. Can't see, not so different than say a tragic figure who stabs his eyes out after romancing is madre. He also built a computer model on its mother's mind, and while that's not in the Greek tragedy, it seems pertinent. The computer is you play. The ulp test also functions on the idea that our mental ailments can mostly be attributed to some unresolved trauma. For Freud, many of our neuroses and mental health problems were brought on by unresolved trauma that we must work through the three stages of the ULP treatment. Take a similar approach, but with the mapping and confrontations ages being more fantasy lives and less laying on the couch talking about your mom, but the connection we really wanted to make was to a pair of thinkers who were strongly opposed to Freud's method, philosopher gl to lose and his psychoanalyst sidekick Felix squats are the three things that got our spidey sense is tingling were one, the use of the term arborization to describe the method they use to map the brain too.

Speaker 1:          12:10          There are bonds I trees everywhere and three, the opening monologue suggests that the universe and life are a chaotic series of collisions for Dilas and watery. The dominant way of thinking about the world is arborescent that is resembling a tree. We often think about history and society like a tree starting at a trunk and growing in a mostly linear fashion while occasionally branching, but the laws in Guata re preferred. Another natural metaphor. The rhizomes rhizomes are the roots of plants like ginger or weeds like dandelions. The important thing about rhizomes is that they look like a series of connections with no visible starting point, like say the roots of a tree. Basically the world is too complex to be understood linearly and instead of simple cause and effect, there's inputs, outputs, feedback loops, and a lot of chaos that we barely understand. So why does this matter for maniac? Well, in some cases we could view the opening monologue under this framework. Life isn't so much a straight line as it is a chaotic assortment of random connections like the structure of a rhizome. The crossing of wires for Owen and Andy kind of follow this logic, the straight line of their computers. Connections are interrupted by a random connection. Bonsai trees in theory would be an interesting addition to the symbolism. Not only is it defined by linearity and branching, but that branching is intentionally guided by a human hand.

Speaker 1:          13:38          Maybe we could say that the show ends up somewhere in the middle between being totally chaotic, rhizome and the guided branching of the bonsai tree after all, and he starts the show saying there is no plan or pattern to the universe. It's just gas and ends the show saying this, if this is assigned friend parks, maybe the universe, and we ultimately abandoned this idea because we couldn't find any evidence that linked the bonsai trees to the couple times that chaos versus order is referenced. We had a few other clues to, but they went nowhere. For instance, Dullas and quaternary are well known for their Book Antietam, which challenges people who sought to analyze the world in Freudian terms specifically they wanted to break free of the oedipal triangle. Mommy, Daddy, and me and mantle ray after interpreting his blindness as a symptom of his mother's behaviors, rejects this Freud and framing and accepts that it was instead brought on by a kiss from a zoomy.

Speaker 1:          14:35          There's also this probably random coincidence, felix squat to rewrote a screenplay called a love of you Iq, which actually sounds kind of like ulp about a subatomic consciousness than inhabits a computer and falls in love with a human plus and watery use. Schizophrenia as a model to think about the world where our desires. We're not limited by the confines of society or say capitalism and yeah, maniacs shows a kind of dystopian capitalism and there's a guy with schizophrenia, but it doesn't quite work. Pitch three. Owens schizophrenia. Yeah. This one's the worst now opposed to the [inaudible] notion of schizophrenia, which we need to say is not exactly literal to the medical condition. There's Frederick Jameson's rebuttal to them. Jamieson suggests that when people are so bombarded with commercial images and messages about who they can be or how a product will make them into this or that person, they're actually imposing competing ideas of identity onto them.

Speaker 1:          15:33          Therefore, this causes a perpetually shifting identity or a schizophrenia subject and the more ones identity vacillates, the more one consumes. Therefore, these schizophrenia subject is ideal for such an economic system. Mentees, there's little doubt that the show hints at a causal connection between advanced consumer capitalism and isolation, but his maniac using Oh, in schizophrenia as a metaphor for the ils heaped upon the denizens of the dystopia. No, definitely a stretch. It's interesting, but there's no evidence we could point to to make a confident case just because we couldn't come up with a cogent argument about the shows. Grander messages doesn't mean it isn't a good show, nor does it mean it isn't a smart show. There are some extremely clever things going on. The constant Easter egg references that connect the dreams not only to other dreams, but to real life, to focus on how narrative builds meaning in our lives.

Speaker 1:          16:33          This makes sense and the small details at the end that make us question the validity of the real world above others. Get it like when the the Lemur. What makes maniacs so impressive is it's daring visual aesthetic. It's formless structure and it's regular dips into absurdity and for that we can't help but admire it. It sticks to a relatively simple thematic base and runs with it that people need connection and it's our ability to bond that can give us hope to beat our demons. That's all for now.
