Speaker 1:          00:03          Very Pale flesh again. So we watched Netflix is new death note movie this weekend and thought it merited some discussion. And of course some spoilers. If you watched our video on the death note anime a couple of weeks ago, you know that we're big fans of the show, draws out incredibly nuanced ideas about the nature of justice, justice, justice, justice, justice, justice, and even participates in it's own philosophical dialogue throughout the series. It's just damn good television, the movie. Well, it's not exactly good cinema. Now, off the bat, I just want to say that adapting at 37 episode animate to a single movie is really, really hard. If someone hired me to do that, I'd be in my pants. So we're not here to grade how closely the new film sticks to the anime or the Monga. It's an adaptation and it deserves some room to do its own thing.

Speaker 1:          00:54          So let's look at the film on its own terms. It's definitely got some good things going for it. And the thing that I most admire is its attempt to preserve some of the thematic richness of the anime, which is an impressive goal for a 100 minute movie that already packs in a lot action sequences, detective games, Gore and teen romance from lights argument that his systematic cheating is no big deal. I'm looking at homework here for at least 15 different students. All right, I get it. I'm in trouble. All I'm trying to say is you have the chance to stop the type of people who make things hard for everybody. You've got to see the big picture here to his conversation with his dad at the end. Death note tries to put some moral ambiguity into lights, character, and gesture to bigger questions about the nature of good and evil.

Speaker 1:          01:37          Given the time constraints. He was smart not to attempt the massive discourses on justice that we see in the anime, but the film makes clear that it's still interested in ethics just in a simplified form. Exactly. Can I do with this death now and see what happens? Unfortunately, that's where the film gets itself into trouble. Toward the beginning. Mr. Turner tells light guns is only as good as the Jameson I make sure people can trust are here. Of course, he's talking about the role of the Seattle police, but light seems to adopt a similar principle using the power of the death note. He liked his animate counterpart wants to create a new world where innocent civilians are protected from the people who make life miserable. The death note is his gun and that's the aim. Although he gets squeamish about offering some law enforcement, we never really see light compromising the intentions behind that aim until his David Copperfield reveal at the end of the film.

Speaker 1:          02:35          Instead they bring in a seductive power hungry girlfriend to play the role of bad cop. For 90% of the movie light is unambiguously the good guy, or at least be kind of okay guy and that's a problem. Kira largely had the support of the people including the police until the death of the FBI team and who sent eight federal agents walking off a building. The duplicitous mia who stole the notebook from light and wrote his name in it, bad, bad me. Who killed what tare by not burning the page with his name on it. We're clearly supposed to blame me up even though light put it there in the first place. Although the film spends next to no time developing what light wants out of his new world, he's still shockingly quick to abandon and once someone dies who hasn't committed a felony or stolen someone's lunch money, you really think people are going to be on their needs.

Speaker 1:          03:27          If you can talk to her like that. We're not killing my dad mia. This is overview just we're not the good guys anymore. We aren't the good guys anymore. Sounds a lot more like people don't like us. Then an actual statement about cure is morality of rule and while the third act of the film tries to play up, the difference between lights, reluctance to kill people and bad meals bloodthirstiness lights, shifts seems more pragmatic than anything. Lights change of perspective isn't an indication that there was ever problems with his plan for becoming a God. Just that the circumstances have changed and he doesn't really want to go to prison, but mia doesn't really mind if a gun is only as good as its aim. It seems like the film should be asking questions about lights, aim with the death note, but instead of saying be careful of aiming your gun in this direction, it's more make sure your crazy girlfriend doesn't get ahold of your gun. Okay. L's quick personality flip from, I don't kill, I just bring justice to I might kill you in the same way you killed hundreds of people seems to be totally dependent on circumstance. The detective strong moral framework developed since childhood gets tossed away instantly when his friend goes missing, but there's no emphasis on the significance of that change. Light ends the film by telling his dad,

Speaker 2:          04:45          first I was just going to kill all the bad guys and good guys. Sometimes you got to choose the lesser of the two years,

Speaker 1:          04:58          but what are these two evils? My guess is that not even light notes, unlike the animate. I know, sorry, I had to say it. Death notes. Ethical ambiguity is less about opening a multitude of possibilities and more about shrugging in the direction of good and evil while ultimately saying nothing

Speaker 2:          05:22          interesting.

Speaker 1:          05:25          Now, once again, condensing an animate of that magnitude into a relatively short film is a difficult task and I won't begrudge the filmmakers some reductions in depth, but what the story clone to most hutchins about good and evil was poorly executed and ended up hamstringing its potential both philosophically and dramatically.
