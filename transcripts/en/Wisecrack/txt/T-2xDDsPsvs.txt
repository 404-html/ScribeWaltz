Speaker 1:          00:12          Hey, why is it cracked? Jared again, for a franchise so surrounded than mystery, it seems fitting that nobody had a clue. The cloverfield paradox had even been made, let alone that it was being released within hours of its announcement during the super bowl. Now there are plenty of reasons why the cloverfield paradox should have worked and plenty of reasons why it didn't, but we're going to focus on the element that makes to largely unrelated scripts so unique and cohesive and makes the third one such an epic fail that element, our relationship to reality and trauma. Welcome this wise crack addition on the cloverfield paradox, what went wrong and spoilers ahead for all of the cloverfield movies before we dip into that secret sauce, a recap of the cloverfield paradoxes in order. The year is 20 slash 28 and the world is in the midst of an energy crisis. Be Crew aboard cloverfield station are orbiting Earth to test the experimental shepherd particle accelerator, which they hope will save the world by producing safe, clean energy just before they turn on the machine. Though we overhear an interview with a writer who thinks that turning on the particle accelerator will open a wormhole to other dimensions and release. God knows what, onto an unsuspecting population

Speaker 2:          01:21          the likes of which we have never seen

Speaker 1:          01:24          and surprise. This is exactly what happens there, teleported into another dimension across space where they experienced the combined horrors of Phantom limbs, creepy crawlers, and faulty wiring. The crew must figure out how to get home and well, you can probably figure out where it goes from there. If there's one thing we should be excited about getting into the cloverfield paradox, it's answers. What was the giant monster that attack New York at the end of the first one? Did it survive the nuke? If we hope to get those answers in 10 cloverfield lane, well we're out of luck. Instead we get Walter Sobchak reminding us that this isn't nom. There are rules.

Speaker 2:          01:58          Yeah, that's great. Sorry, I just got a little excited. Well, keeping that point

Speaker 1:          02:06          and as our protagonist escapes his clutches, she enters a world of pain and aliens come on, but the cloverfield paradox does give us answers those giant monsters. It's from another dimension, the camcorder video. It might not even be from the same timeline, so why isn't getting these answers more rewarding. Cloverfield and 10 cloverfield lane are both films about trauma, both the trauma one might associate with war or natural disaster or extra dimensional aliens destroying your home and the trauma of being physically trapped in a relationship with a person that's going to go full Jack Torrance at any minute, ears johnny 10 cloverfield lane brings up all the same aspects of abusive relationships. Possible gas lighting. There is nowhere to go, Michelle and threats of violence interspersed with normal family fund, but the first two movies aren't just about dealing with trauma. They are about the impossibility of fully comprehending that trauma.

Speaker 1:          02:58          These insanely violent encounters with a lack of closure. Speak to one of the fundamental difficulties of navigating the world for philosopher and sometimes Klepto Maniac Jacques Lacan. There exists a fundamental human inability to fully grasp what he calls the real or the world as it truly is, who were field throws us in the midst of an alien invasion that evades easy description. We're often given the byproduct of what's happening or people's reactions, but almost never get the source of the turmoil and unexplainable way like when the head of the Statue of Liberty comes rolling down the street or a horrifically disfigured woman is begging for help.

Speaker 1:          03:37          First cloverfield the reality of what's happening only sparsely comes in new segments in the background. One of the ways cloverfield achieves this is with perspective. It's filmed pov style shot by the characters in the movie and begins with a detailed look at our main cast of characters during a party for the protagonist rob in the middle of the Shin Dig. They're interrupted by an explosion signaling the monster invasion, their battle for survival. Cinder cut with older video that is being recorded over, which gives you glimpses into the relationship between rob and Beth. This subjective point of view means we only ever get hints of where and what the monster is. How the military are responding to it and even what it looks like, you know, just like you would in real life by shooting it this way. We don't know what kind of monster they are facing, but we do know who the characters are and what they're facing personally. 10 cloverfield lane employs a similar technique. It doesn't use the same Pov south who cut us off from the reality of what's happening, but rather uses a concrete bunker to similar ends. The protagonist Michelle wakes up in a bunker that she can't leave for reasons that seemed suspicious to say the least she's told she was rescued.

Speaker 3:          04:43          Give it us how I saved your life. I think that's acceptable

Speaker 1:          04:46          and that the outside world is deadly

Speaker 3:          04:48          outside of here.

Speaker 1:          04:50          Now, if we suspect that Howard is preparing to where Michelle skin, we get just enough interaction from the outside world to give credence to his story, but not enough to truly know what's happening. As the movie ends, we get enough information to let us know that things aren't going great for earth, but not much else. The control of information in both movies is what makes them so tense and entertaining. We have to fill in the gap which instead of being frustrating makes with the sort of thing that spawns endless. Fan theories for Lacan that reality, which seems to evade us the real, is disconnected from our own personal experience only through language or what he calls the symbolic can we bridge the gap between our minds and the reality beyond them. What cloverfield explorers is the chasm between the real and language, the inability to bridge that gap, the characters and us.

Speaker 1:          05:40          The audience want answers. We want to understand what is happening, but the film withholds the language to explain it. That chasm for Lacan is called Lac and it's what drives the tension of the first two movies. We all know what it's like to be at a loss for words during a terrible event. Footage of nine slash 11 shows onlookers covering their mouths in silent horror while watching the tragic events happen in front of them. It's no secret that these cinema verite found footage style of the original cloverfield was inspired by the events and coverage of nine slash 11, that kind of cultural trauma runs deep and was still a raw nerve at the time of the trailers release. Mass entertainment wasn't willing to return to these sorts of disaster movies right away, but the movie is able to tap into that post nine slash 11 anxiety by borrowing from the structure of hygiene movies there by using a symbol to represent that shared trauma. This is what makes it so cathartic. 10 cloverfield lane released some eight years later at a time of cultural uncertainty and change was a paranoid thriller that makes you question the people around you against this gap between language and reality. The cloverfield paradox gives us its antithesis sites.

Speaker 2:          06:48          This is the paradox. Excuse me, particles interacting with each other across two dimensions. Okay, I'm going to sit down to have distinct realities in a multiverse.

Speaker 1:          06:57          While there are certainly unexplained events like why the hell did Mondays arm keep moving after it was detached? The whole premise of the movie trans dimensional travel explains the origin of the cloverfield event in the first 15 minutes of the movie

Speaker 2:          07:10          monsters, Demons East to clarify, you believe their efforts to solve the energy crisis might unleash demons and not just hearing that in the past, in the future, in other dimensions,

Speaker 1:          07:26          sure. We're not saying mysteries can't be solved or that science can do it, but it shouldn't be as background noise in the first half of the movie turns out the terrifying, ineffable monstrosities that have invaded earth for reasons beyond our imagining happened because sites little disappointing isn't it, and if you're going to give an explanation or revelation, there's a certain way to do it. Good examples tend to give us a paradigm shift or clarify motives. In exceptional cases, they can give you an entirely new way to view the events prior, like when you find out the truth about Tyler durden or the men in black. How does quantum entanglement add to or reframe the original cloverfield stories? It doesn't, and besides breaking away from the kind of trauma that defined the first two movies, there is no central fear or shared trauma for the audience to latch onto.

Speaker 1:          08:12          If cloverfield was the fear of an invasion and 10 cloverfield lane was the fear of other people, what's the central fear of this movie? Fear of particle accelerators, peak oil by explaining way, the mystery almost as an afterthought. You Rub the audience not just of their mystery but there catharsis. While yes, explaining a mystery ruins the fun is kind of an obvious point. It's what creates our desires for mystery that is important to the cloverfield movies. MILIKAN's idea of lack gets to the heart of understanding why we love a good mystery and why jj Abrams property seemed to have such a hard time with resolving those mysteries. We're looking at you last just to the reality around us always evades easy answers and the to describe it. We don't want everything explained, not just because we all like a good conspiracy theory, but because of the catharsis that comes with these shared experience of realizing that some things can't end sometimes shouldn't be put into words. The first to cloverfield movies knew this and played on that, which is what made them so interesting and ultimately rewarding. The cloverfield paradox paradoxically ruins the fun by giving us all the answers and pretty half baked ones at that. So what do you think wisecrack can the movie have more tastefully explain the mystery. Let us know what you think in the comments, and as always, thanks for watching. Hayes
