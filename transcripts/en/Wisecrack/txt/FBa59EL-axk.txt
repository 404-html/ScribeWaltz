What's up wisecrack jared? Again, if you guys haven't seen the torrent of tweets, Netflix, new show, the haunting of hill house is getting some serious notoriety. It's got a 93% fresh rating on rotten tomatoes and some people are saying it's so scary, they're puking their guts out seriously, which brings us to the question in a genre as bloated as horror. What makes another story about a haunted house stand out? While we could point to the casting camera work or one of the best jump scares I've seen, we actually think it has to do with wait for it. Ghosts. All right, I know, but what makes hillhouse rise above shows like American horror story is a duality of the ghost metaphor that is incredibly smart.

Speaker 1:          00:54          So grab those adult diapers and join me for this wisecrack quick take on the haunting of Hill House and yes was head. But before we get into it and want to give a shout out to our sponsor over at epic games, they're the creators of this really addicting game. You may have heard of called fortnite hop on a battle bus and had to an island for the ultimate battle l'oreal. I actually recently downloaded on my phone and I'm digging it so to download the game for free, head to the link in the description and stick around till the end of the video to hear more. All right guys. First a quick recap. The show follows the cranes during their stay at the haunted hill house in the 1980s while the parents, Olivia and hugh are trying to flip the home. Mother and I, we have to finish fixing this house and then someone has to buy it 50 years before it was trendy.

Speaker 1:          01:37          The kids spend the summer being irreparably traumatized by a series of terrifying events. This all comes to an end though. When the father rushes the kids out of the house one night. What the show portrays is some spooky hunting business from the perspective of the children is eventually revealed to be the suicide of the mother. Flash forward to the presence and all the children are still living under the shadow of their past. Steve, the oldest is a successful, albeit cynical author writing about his paranormal childhood. Shirley is a tightly wound type A mortician. Vo is a clinical psychologist with some serious intimacy issues. Luke is a junkie 90 days clean and his twin sister now, well now's dead and it's her death that starts off a fresh batch of hauntings. If those character descriptions haven't tipped you off already, the heroes and hill house aren't your typical cookie cutter characters and other horror series, but to understand how they're so different, we first have to understand an idea and writing called the ghost, which has been explored by the author K and Weiland as we'll see what makes the haunting of hill house so good is the blurry boundary between Weiland's ghost as technique and the show's ghost as, oh my God, what the fuck is wrong with that kid?

Speaker 1:          02:47          As for wildland scopes. The idea is this at the beginning of a story, our heroes aren't usually the greatest people. They can be jealous like woody and toy story or selfish like ebeneezer scrooge and a Christmas according to wildland. At the heart of these personal feelings lies a basic psychological mechanism in which we value survival in one aspect of our lives over survival in another. In other words, we'd lean into certain beliefs even though they might make us unhappy just so we can survive. And the reason why we formed these beliefs, Weiland calls this your ghost though other authors, we'll call it your wound or simply your past trauma for woody in toy story, his ghost or trauma is the knowledge that unloved toys are discarded causing his jealousy of buzz, which blinds him to his unsavory behavior. For Scrooge, his ghost is the poverty he experienced in his childhood, which later causes him to be the penny pinching man.

Speaker 1:          03:43          We all know blinding him to the fact that he has ruined his life. What he and scrooge up to protect their wound fear and poverty respectively at the expense of everything else. In the haunting of Hill House, it becomes clear that the actual ghosts are some kind of metaphor for the horrifying events the crane family faces. Chevron are, Mike Flanagan expertly leverages each character's past trauma or ghost to explain why our heroes are so messed up as adults. Steve witnessing his mother's friend mental state firsthand rationalizes his whole childhood as a product of mental illness. In fact, he's so convinced that his family has a genetic mental condition that he gets a vasectomy right out of college. I was there something wrong with our goddamn brains. So yeah, I'm never having children. I made sure surely who takes in a box of kittens as a child only to have them go dead and crazy demonic becomes fascinated with the way morticians fix a person making a corpse seem alive again.

Speaker 1:          04:50          That's what I do, unsurprisingly. She then becomes a control freak. Mortician as for Theo, her special ability to understand the essence of something by touching it backfires when she touches her mom and sees a rotting corpse. And how does the o turnout as an adult, she flexes her ability to help people in her day job while wearing gloves in her free time and having shallow emotional relationships. And Luke, well, Luke's substance abuse stems from watching his mom poison and kill his childhood friend and from the various obsessive coping mechanisms he developed to distract himself. Like any good story though, the haunting of hill house builds out it's conflicts by having characters confront their trauma. And this is the part where we get to the literal ghosts of the show. Now there's a seriously large grab bag of ghosts in the series. In fact, if you look hard enough, you can see a random ghosts lingering in the background of almost any shot.

Speaker 1:          05:44          And while there's a whole cast of ghouls that have almost nothing to do with our characters back stories, the most memorable ghost or the personified embodiments of our characters, past traumas in psychoanalytic terms, we could view these literal ghosts as an example of splitting where people splinter off and repackage the negative parts of themselves or others, nor to maintain a positive sense of self. It's like Weiland said, it's all about survival except in the crane family's case. The unconference did trauma manifests as actual ghost. The literary ghost becomes a literal ghosts. It's in the red room where all these literal manifestations of trauma come to the fore. It's real is like the heart of the house, not a hard to stomach. And the series closing episodes, all of our surviving crane children converge in the red room. We're the house puts them each to a mental test. They must confront their literal and metaphorical ghost. For Steve, he must confront his concern over his family's tainted blood line when he experiences a room 1408 moment and is transported into the future, or he got out of Hill House alive, complete with a happy pregnant wife. That is until he realizes he never left the house and his wife's baby becomes a literal rot splitting open her stomach. Yeah, it's pretty gruesome. Surely on the other hand, must confront her inability to fix everything, including her personal shortcomings. And she does so by reliving her own secret affair.

Speaker 2:          07:09          You did it any light in and you just decided not to look at it. Now that's all over.

Speaker 1:          07:17          Charlene never wants to look. Things are even worse for Fiona. She grapples with her self imposed emotional isolation while on the bed with her casual lover feel loses her ability to feel anything at all and a thousand hands drag her down. And Luke, well Lucas transported back in time back to the tea party with his mom, his twin now, and his childhood friend Luke glimpsing. A life without the pain of addiction or the death of the three people closest to him is tempted to sit down and give it. That is until Nell saves him go.

Speaker 3:          07:50          Okay,

Speaker 1:          07:51          why would you want your brother to go, hey, just got here, have a seat. Don't exactly as she saves all the crane children by pulling them out of their nightmares. Now, some of you might think that Nell swooping in is a Dsx Mokena ending, but as story guru slash wise crack favorite Dan harmon would tell you, the characters in this portion of the story have earned it by confronting the worst parts of themselves in their past. They've grown as people and the universe is responding by throwing them a lifeline in the form of now. Case in point now literally forgives each one of them before stressing the importance of love, forgiveness like a tear on a cheek. Thank you for that and then for me when you stand in the rain.

Speaker 3:          08:41          Okay. Hmm.

Speaker 1:          08:43          I loved you completely. You loved me the same. That's all

Speaker 1:          08:52          the rest is confetti. After Nell, the father exchanges his life in order to free his children and the group escapes having conquered both their literal and metaphorical ghosts. The cranes then go on to lead fulfilling lives, free of the supernatural. Steve reconciles with his expect and wife. Shirley comes clean with her husband. Feo throws her gloves away and commits to a real relationship and luke hits the two years sober mark surrounded by his siblings in showing us these happy endings. The haunting of hill house is firmly making a statement that there is light in the darkness, that trauma can be overcome. It's like what Steve said about fear feel to it where we find it, we cannot meet halfway and if surrounded by family or love, perhaps we can face it directly. So what do you guys think is the haunting of Hill House? Really that scary is it's use of ghosts that much of a departure from the horror genre.
