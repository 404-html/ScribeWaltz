Speaker 1:          00:03          What's up wise crack you've been asking for it and it's finally time. This week we're diving into the insanely smart neon Genesis Evangelian. Ava is a phenomenally complex story on the surface it's about the end of the world and teenagers and enormous biomechanical monsters who fight giants, alien Angel Robot Things, but beneath that there's an investigation of psychosexual development, intimacy, unconscious human motivation and how hard it is to be a person, but the real meat of everything is about

Speaker 2:          00:32          hedgehogs.

Thanks again the blue apron and onto evangelian and if you haven't seen it, spoilers ahead. Just a quick note, even though the Ava reboot is beautiful, we decided to keep our analysis to the original 26 episode series and the films and have Evangelian and death and rebirth and if you like this, maybe we'll come back for more. So first a quick recap. In the distant future of 2015 the earth is under attack by an earthly beings called angels. In order to combat them. Humanity has created ass kicking robots that sync with their pilots called Ava's.

Speaker 1:          02:03          Of course, the evas aren't all day scenes. They're actually former angels infused with the souls of humans inside the empty shell. Bj Ba is a human. Some specifically be mothers of the various pilots. Shinji, Ahsoka and ray who is a clone, worked together to pilot the evas, save the world and come to terms with their inner demons. Oh, also, ray bonds, the DNA of original angels, Adam and Lilith becomes a being containing the consciousness of all humanity and pretends the end of existence. But don't worry, we'll cover that. Do understand the ending of evangelic and we'd have to dive into some complicated ideas, but I promise it'll be fun. Part One, as [inaudible] and mysticism, neon genesis evangelian literally means a new beginning. Neon is derived from the Greek neos, which means new genesis is a beginning and a reference to the opening book of the Bible. And Evangelican is the gospel or the good news from the same root as evangelize.

Speaker 1:          02:58          So neon genesis Evangelian is a new telling of the Gospel Genesis or the easy way. It's a reimagining of the book of Genesis with lots of technology, brooding and sex. Ava is overflowing with religious iconography. Some of the references are easy to spot. The show references the Dead Sea scrolls explicitly incidents not depicted in the dead sea scrolls may occur. This should teach the old metal lesson and Ritz go installs a six six six type firewall to protect the madge I from a cyber attack. It cottey has installed a type six six six firewall on the Mount Joe's external feeds surface. That's very difficult to breach. Not to mention the presence of creatures called angels, two of which are named Adam and Lilith. You might've expected eve, but Lilith is Adam's female counterpart. According to Jewish folklore, she was created around the same time as Adam and is usually described as being a mother of Daemons.

Speaker 1:          03:48          You know, evil in ava humans are the descendants of Louis. Some of the religious work is Christian in nature. The [inaudible] system. The super computer network that runs nerve has three parts, each named after the three wiseman. Casper Alphas are Mlq or you know, the guys that visited baby Jesus to give him the gifts of gold and I Frankenstein and Helen Mirren put the majority of the religious imagery is based on Jewish mysticism and the Kabbalah. Kabbalah is an investigative practice of faith and mystical teachings at seeks religious revelation and sacred knowledge. Some of its biggest fans are ancient rabbis and also Madonna. Most of the angels and Ava are taken directly from techs and Judaism's extended universe like Zahar. Essentially the Kabbalah is Bible, the Talmud and the book of Enoch. Others are written in El Theosophy, a form of mystical riding that uses the El Suffix, which is one of the many Hebrew words for God to tie names to the divine and it's all over Evangelian, ramial Saatchi, old material and Caladrius.

Speaker 1:          04:47          No, sorry. Scratch that one. In cobblistic tradition, the first being is Adam cadman. Not to be confused with the other famous Adam, a being of light, which is eerily similar to the giant of light. That is Ava's first angel named Adam who explodes in the second impact. That's second impact, kills half the population of the planet and turns the oceans read revelation style. This destruction is a nother call back to the cabalistic tradition. An event called the Chevron Tok Helene or the breaking of vessels. See in the beginning, everything was connected. Part of a universal unity that broke apart, leaving everything separate and creating the many splintered world we live in. It's sort of like a theological big bay. The purpose of Kabbalah is to coon, how long or the restoration of the world it's traditionally practice through acts of good deeds and prayer. But in ava it's taken kind of literally the ethical call of the Kabbalah is the reunification of the world, of the different fragmented parts of Adam call up the syfy road, which is depicted as the tree of life as 10 circles in a particular pattern.

Speaker 1:          05:50          It creates a sort of visual tree that has meant to depict the tree of life. It's why the random circles a pure around ava one when it's attacked by the nine manufacturer angels, they're all fulfilling the sacred duty or purpose of the Kabbalah. The sephora roads re unifies everything. Recreating the universe as a complete whole and in doing so destroys the individuality and separation that defines life as we know it. Many characters pursue the goal of literally reunifying the world, putting all the different consciousnesses into one place. The industry who are bitching, oh stage and our souls will be at peace. This finally happens after the Adam Luleth DNA combined inside of Ray. The reunification with the masculine and feminine aspect of the angels is the reunification of the world as well. This raises the question of why exactly the world needs to be reunited. What does it mean for the world to be broken?

Speaker 1:          06:50          To answer that, we need only to turn to our adorable friend the hedgehog and no, not that one. Part two, the hedgehogs dilemma. So much of Evangelian is eye candy, sex, big ass robots, explosions, more sex, the apocalypse. But it's at its most profound when the narrative dives into the crimson red lakes of sadness, isolation, and the human condition. I'm seeing this for the first time, and again, this was the first time it pauses on empty streets on telephone poles where nothing scares the birds away and on classrooms with no students. The world without half its population is a sad place. The end of himes isn't partying like it's 1999 it just sucks the characters, miserable lives and intimacy problems can be explained by a hedgehog and the pre eminent philosophical pessimists, Arthur schopenhauer in his book, [inaudible] and perilite Hamina short philosophical essays, volume to schopenhauer details, a short parable that has become known as the hedgehog or the porcupines dilemma in it's, he explains the human condition by comparing humans. Two hedgehogs huddled together for warmth, though they crave warm, hedgehogs can't get too close because of their quills, so they keep their distance and remain cold or learn to live without the warmth of others. So what does this have to do with ava? Well, everything. The hedgehog is dilemma is Eva's guiding theme in episode three Writ Sukkot explains the parable to mid Sato. Do you know the fable,

Speaker 3:          08:18          the hedgehogs dilemma hedgehog? You mean those animals with the spiny hair, even though a hedgehog may want to become close with another hedgehog, the closer they get, the more they injure each other with their spines. It's the same with some humans

Speaker 1:          08:32          and episode four it's even called the hedgehogs dilemma. That desire to be unhurt drives a wedge between people. It creates a world of despair. We see that world and its implications. In episode 16 titled Sickness Unto Death, which is a reference to Danish philosopher, Soren Kierkegaard. A sickness unto death is despair. Eight terrible existential loneliness which goes along with Schopenhauer is hedgehogs pretty neatly as does episode 23 after Kaji is killed and he leaves a sad message on mid satos machine. She remarks another phone that will never ring. It's the epitome of lonesomeness waiting for someone to reach out and call. It's a depressing show filled with depressed people. Ahsoka piles her ava to find meaning in life. Without it. She's just a sad girl crying in a dingy apartment. We see in flashbacks that though she may seem gruff, she fears being alone and pilots or ava to draw people toward her and expand her world.

Speaker 1:          09:36          There's Kendo who struggles with his ability to show Shinji love and doesn't know how to be a father when she, she is near me. All I ever do is causing pain. When he's reunited with Youi, he explains that I never deserved to be loved, so he rejected the world so he wouldn't feel pain in his book. The world as will and representation. Schopenhauer argues that life is suffering because the world is made up of will and representation for Schopenhauer. The nature of reality is unity. We'd all be at peace without this struggle to communicate between individuals. Suffering is the result of individuality. To be human is to suffer because communication, perception and understanding we'll never be perfect and that struggled to connect is the source of our suffering. The Universe is really one thing in itself, one entity, but each individual will or ego can only perceive the world from its own vantage point or perception. That's what schopenhauer means. When he says representation, anguish, fragmentation, alienation and isolation are all because each person is in charge of their will and there is a disconnect between what we desire and what the world gives us, which is echoed by cohorts.

Speaker 4:          10:49          This is mankind's fake. If human hope, this fun with the flex or Solano,

Speaker 1:          10:54          that's separation of wills is what the show calls a tea fields, which are something like the unique human soul that's separate each person's ego. It's sort of their life force. The barrier that keeps us from truly connecting to each other. Several times characters have conversations about what it means to be an ego and to have a body usually as their body or consciousness is slipping away. Ray does this in episodes 14 and 23 both exchanges are reflections on what it means to be a human being that has a body and is recognized by others.

Speaker 3:          11:27          You're right at the core, we are all the same. Our minds lack something basic and we fear that lack and that is why we are attempting to become one. We will meld with and fill each other. This is the instrumentalities. Mankind cannot live without being surrounded by others. Mankind cannot live alone, although you yourself are always unique. That is why life is hard. That is why life is sad and empty cause want to close physical and mental preference of others. That is why we wish to me come on.

Speaker 1:          11:57          This struggle with isolation and the pain of rejection defines ava. Unfortunately as schopenhauer tells us, being alive means living with will and ego and that means pain that drive to get away from this pain and ego is something that we can explain what the help of our cocaine addled friend, Doctor Freud, part three psycho analysis. I know people are mad because Freud is considered a hack and didn't science hard enough. I get it but hey, eva explicitly uses 40 in terms ideas and analysis. Episode 19 is called Trajection, a 40 in term that explains how people take on characteristics of the people around them. You know copycats. Episode 20 is called weaving a story to oral stage. The oral stage corresponds to the weaning of a child from breastfeeding. According to Freud, when a child too soon and they're out of touch with people's emotions and are generally sociopathic, wean them too late and they're dependent too long on the mother for security and end up neurotic Mama's boys.

Speaker 1:          12:57          Kind of like that. Robin Aaron Kid from game of thrones. All the kids in Ava's pilot classes are motherless children or so they think in fact Shinji. His mom is unit one soul and part of Asa. His mother's soul is in unit two. Both Ava's use the soul's inside them to further bond with their pilots. How the pilot reacts to their mother is indicative of their general disposition. It's as 40 and is it can get there all morning. The last love object that is their mother except ray, is less mournful and more melancholic because she has no soul as an artificial being. She has no real loss to speak of no mama soul to snatch and put in a robot. For Freud. Mourning happens when we know what we have lost. Melancholy on the other hand is much more serious. It occurs when people have no idea what's missing. Only that it causes them deep, deep sadness, hence the need for psychotherapy. That's why the last two episodes of the show are literally a psychotherapy session inside Shinji his mind,

Speaker 3:          13:54          but if you depend only on the ava, Ava will become your only identifier. April will become your own lead value. Without that value you the wheel, you will be erased from this existence.

Speaker 1:          14:04          We mentioned the manager I super computers before, but we didn't tell you that they have the mind of Dr Naoko Akagi imprinted in them. They are reflective of the tripartite model of the human unconscious, the controlling scientist as the ego, the mother as the punishing and guilt inducing superego and the woman as the sexual in episode 18 is titled Ambivalence. A Freudian idea that eva really leans into and bill mullins is the way that people can passionately hate and love. At the same time, like when I eat chipolte lake for example, Shinji is constantly talking about how much he hates his father.

Speaker 3:          14:39          However, I really hated my father,

Speaker 1:          14:41          yet he gets in the ava over and over to make daddy proud. In episode 12 he explains, he pilots the ava to hear words of praise from his dad.

Speaker 3:          14:49          I think I finally understood the part about being praised by someone when I heard my father's words today, and I also realized that the reason I pilot my ava is to hear those words from him.

Speaker 1:          15:02          He runs away from his dad nerve and his responsibilities as an ava pilot, but he keeps coming back.

Speaker 3:          15:08          I must've grown away. I must've run away.

Speaker 1:          15:12          The real smart stuff he's done with arrows and thanatos or the drive to life and the death drive for Freud beings are instilled with the pleasure principal, the general inclination to avoid pain and maximize pleasure. So in episode 16 when Shinji falls into the direct C or a pocket universe elements, yeah,

Speaker 3:          15:30          this world is filled with too much pain and suffering to keep going on.

Speaker 1:          15:34          He's expressing his desire to minimize suffering. As it pertains to the pleasure principle, this struggle to avoid pain is aligned with schopenhauer. His ideas about will and struggle. How can we ever avoid suffering when we have to share a world with other people, all of whom have their own desires that sometimes get in the way of ours? How do we find peace for sale a nerve and even individuals like Gando in Shinji? It all comes back to instrumentalization. The process by which all human consciousness is combined into a primordial soup called lcl. That desire to join a unified whole and no longer be concerned with issues of the self comes up in Freud to it's called the death drive. The death drive is a desire to return to tranquility, to the peace and harmony of the womb, and what can be more peaceful than the end of every once it's gone. There's nothing to worry about. Episode 25 has a direct call to this with the text. The case of Shinji Akari, the boy who wished for death of his own will then Kendo in the mind of Shinji states that instrumentality. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          16:35          It's not a return to nothingness. It is merely a return to a state of beginning. It is no less than a return to the primal wound that we'd lost so long ago. Souls and minds will become one attaining internal balance.

Speaker 1:          16:48          Oh, return to Lilith and to coon hall along the restoration of the world or the reunification with the primordial being. And so salian nerve are working for the death drive and they count on Shinji to become the arc for humanity, that which will allow them to return to a world without loneliness and isolation. Conclusion. So the human reaction to the hedgehogs dilemma is to seek tranquility and a return to the womb. But as we've seen, that's simply a desire for death, a running away. So what has to be done? Well, it's Kaworu a character who is not entirely human, that shows us the way accepting vulnerability Kaworu gives up his individual desires and we'll so that Shinji can live. He is unguarded and open with his absolute love for Shinji. He represents a way out of the cycle of constant suffering and isolation. And he just gives damn good advice.

Speaker 6:          17:41          I know that by keeping others at a distance, you avoid a betrayal of your trust. For a while you may not be hurt that way. You mustn't that you must endure the loneliness. Men cannot erase this sentence because the owner fundamentally pain is something that man must endure in his hard and since the heart feels pain so easily, some believe life is pain.

Speaker 1:          18:06          In the final episodes and the movie chinchy initially accepts instrumentalization, but when he understands just what he'd lose himself, he has a change of heart.

Speaker 3:          18:17          Your self image is restrained by having to observe the barriers between yourself and others. You cannot see yourself without the presence of awesome because there were others. I can perceive myself as an individual. If I'm alone, then I will be the same without others. For this world is only of me, then there will be no difference between me and nothing.

Speaker 1:          18:35          At the end of the series, Shinji rejects instrumentality.

Speaker 3:          18:38          Hi me, I want to be myself. I want to continue existing in this world

Speaker 1:          18:44          mount as a world where everyone is primordial soup and shares one mind.

Speaker 3:          18:49          What is this empty space? An empty world, a world where nothing exists with myself, but with only my Silva. I have nothing to interact with. It's as if I'm here but not here at all. It's just if I'm slowly fading out of existence,

Speaker 1:          19:05          he ops for one where people can be hurt. Where we are in close, where there is a separation and individual selves where there are individuals, wheels, desires and pain. He confronts the drive to inorganic existence and accepts the inevitability of suffering in life.

Speaker 3:          19:23          That's correct. If the pain is too harsh, you can escape it. If you really hated changing style. No, I won't. I'm tired of escaping a little money,

Speaker 1:          19:36          but he also opens the door for hope and joy. So the first thing he does when he rejects instrumentality, he turns over and chokes Ahsoka. She responds by stroking his face, reminding us that the world they chose is one of violence and pain, but also love all three elements of the story. The theological, psychological and philosophical deal with something called lack in psychology, lack as explored by the Freud inspired psycho analysis and philosophers. Jacques Lacan is the missing center at the heart of our existence, the missing piece between representation and the world in itself, whether it be a scarcity of friends, failing, marriages and relationships or distance between father and son. Eva is able to consistently weave, applaud that delves deep into the visceral reality of humanities, disappointing existence. Three pilots, Ray, the Japanese word for soul, ghost not or zero in unit zero Shinji the pilot of unit number one.

Speaker 1:          20:34          The first real person introduced the other, the pilot of unit number two, a girl a call back to the expulsion from Eden, the world of infinite knowledge and life in the end it's just asa and Shinji, a new Adam and eve, a new beginning.
