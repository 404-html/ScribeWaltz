Speaker 1:          00:08          Play the one case that everybody has held, the speculator and people have watched the process and operation has been the Floyd Landis case, the cyclist where the two different approaches for detecting testosterone abuse suggested that an abuse occurred. They two tasks are totally different approaches. Both came up with the same result. He's challenged that and there's one of the challenges actually the challenge is work up the chain of command if you will. And I went to the United States Anti Doping Agency and uh, the, the tribunals that looked at that particular case of experts, uh, concluded that there was a doping violation. And I believe he's taking this to the Court of Arbitration and Sport, which is the last stop. Uh, but it was a interesting, uh, experience for the, because people watched how complicated this all is. And I, that's probably at the bottom line of what I want to say here is how complicated and sophisticated this all is.

Speaker 1:          01:17          This is, uh, this is not just taking a pill. Uh, the science is very demanding. Uh, the adjudication process is very demanding. Uh, there's a lot of stake here. Uh, and the only way it seems to me this was able to be dealt with. It's still institutionalized the whole process. And that's really how water was born, whether it was the laboratories, the collection of specimens, the handing out of sanctions is developing the list, the concept of therapeutic use exemptions, which we should talk about. Uh, there are so many different elements to this, uh, that, uh, soundbite critiques of doping really don't do justice to the evolution of the end of doping movement over the last eight or nine
