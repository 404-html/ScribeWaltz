Speaker 1:          00:11          Hey, wisecrack jared here. If you've been listening to our self park podcast, respect our authortalk. You know, we've been low key obsessed with a really interesting problem south park is facing this year. How do you make social satire when reality is already so absurd and interviews? Matt and Trey have noted that liberals and conservatives frequently praise the same episodes. Each thinking of the show has secretly sided with them. Then after season 20 was all been railroaded by the 2016 election. Oh Jeez. This doesn't look very fun. They made a new valve. Avoid trump related narratives. We don't want to be CNN. They told the independent, but with divisive politics dominating our national discourse. Can a show that prides itself on not taking sides continue to stay relevant judging by their latest episode, which manages to take a stance without resorting to partisan talking points? The answer is absolute.

Speaker 1:          01:03          In fact, this episode is one of my favorite indictments of trump on television and quite possibly one of the most nuanced. Of course, that's not to say they have anything uplifting to say because if there's any one consistent message this season, it's that well, we're all to death. Let's make this country great again. Welcome this wise crack quick take on South Park's doubling down and as always spoilers ahead. But first a quick recap. Heidi once again tries to end things with Eric probably for something petty. Cogni or foreign pushed me in front of a car. As always, he ugly cries and emotionally blackmail, sir and just staying with him after watching cartman continue to abuse. Heidi Kyle makes it his duty to rescue her. It is our problem and eventually realizes he's fallen for her. Meanwhile, Paul Ryan, Mitch Mcconnell and Mike Pence try to stand up to the president, but garrison gives them a little taste of his signature. Can people to death. Hope you brought some condoms after some illicit courtship Heidi dumps cartman gets with Kyle and carbon vows to take revenge on his least favorite too.

Speaker 1:          02:11          Things seem to be looking up for Heidi until her friends make her feel like forever dating carbon in the first place. All the, I told you, so's make Heidi feel hurt and resentful, causing her to double down on carbon. Who presumably gives her an offscreen lecture about the merits of antisemitism. It's hard to know for that. People are always trying to get ahead covered in blankets and bruises. Pence, Ryan and Mcconnell commemorate garrison's first anniversary. Yes. As president and garrison reassures them that the next three years will be even worse. What's so brilliant about this episode is how the A and b plots parallel each other. The main gist is just as Heidi is in an abusive relationship with Cartman, so two are trump supporters in an abusive relationship with trump. The parallel is hinted at early in the episode through subtly coded language. Kyle wondering why Heidi staying with Cartman asks,

Speaker 2:          03:04          she's still supporting him. She loves him, I guess, but he clearly sucks. Really sucks. Whatever was going on

Speaker 1:          03:10          here are his wording is deliberately identical to be stock language. Critics used to question why trump voters continue to support him. Kyle. Then straight up ask tidy what the deal is and here's where the parallel falls perfectly into place. It turns out Heidi Hartmann, like president garrison are about to celebrate their one year

Speaker 2:          03:28          bursary. I know you and Carmen have an anniversary coming up and I just wondering, you've known him. How do you think he's doing? Has a boyfriend? Kyle presses the point, again, using language perfectly suited to trumps. Some of us are thinking that maybe he's not super qualified to be with you

Speaker 1:          03:43          here. Kyle was pretty clearly playing the role of a liberal reporter interviewing a trump supporter.

Speaker 2:          03:48          One of the things about carbon that you find remotely redeeming this approach does not prove very tactful and Heidi doubles down on Cartman. Great. You don't know what Eric's like when we're alone. He's actually really good to me.

Speaker 1:          04:02          Later in the episode we see the exact same exchange in a more familiar context.

Speaker 2:          04:07          Speaker Ryan, it's the anniversary of the president being elected. How do you think he's doing well? What do you mean he's great? We're doing great. A lot of people judge him and just see the negative. People don't know how great the president can be behind closed doors.

Speaker 1:          04:21          The irony becomes layered when just as kyle uses political polling lingo to talk about Cartman Paul Ryan starts using language associated with domestic abuse to protect trump

Speaker 2:          04:30          and is that semen on your black art? Oh Nah, I tripped on a tornado. That's just, that's thrown up. Come

Speaker 1:          04:37          later. Heidi finally admits to kyle that she may have made a mistake here. Again, her description of falling for cartman sounds like the description reporters use to explain how the white working class voter fail for trump.

Speaker 2:          04:48          Before we started going out, he was in a really bad place. I felt pushed away by society. Famous guy came along who told me all the things I wanted to hear it. We'll just wait with it. Does that make me a bad person

Speaker 1:          05:04          here? Kyle helpfully points out how cartman like trump constantly plays the victim to when sympathy. No run. We see ourselves as the victim sometimes, but carbon sees himself as the victim all the time. Meanwhile, Heidis essentially the perfect stand in for the regretful trump voter who really doesn't want to admit he was wrong. I don't know how I'm going to face people with funding and we give up. This culminates in a beautiful montage that essentially sums up the episode eight dejected. Heidi evaluates her relationship and the took her job's dudes cry watching trump on TV. The message is clear. Heidi represents the white working class voter who is struggling to accept that banking on trump was a mistake, but a glimmer of hope appears for both Heidi and the Republican leadership respectively. A healthy relationship with kyle and garrison's dismal poll numbers. We'll republican leaders and high he be able to escape their cycles of abuse, not so as garrison says, see, I know something about societal psychology that you three turd balls down, everything's gonna be fine.

Speaker 1:          06:04          What is garrison talking about first to preface, something unique about South Park is the nuanced way it critiques liberals. Whereas due to the general liberal politics of Hollywood, most satirical shows tend to mock conservatives. That trend has been particularly true in the past year when snl and others doubled down on trump theme lampoon or of course these shows are unlikely to resonate with even a vaguely regretful trump voter. This climate is part of what has made Matt and Trey reluctant to constantly take easy shots at trump or his supporters this season, which brings us to the dinner with Heidi and her pouch who bombard her with an array of smug jokes about cartman's racism and sociopathic tendencies. Ultimately all these antiques do is put Heidi on the defensive, making her feel stupid. Matt and Trey seem to be critiquing the way Hollywood has essentially declared open season on trump and his supporters. This is most clearly expressed through. Kyle will often acts as the metal voice of reason for the show.

Speaker 2:          07:04          You guys shouldn't criticize her so much for going with carton. Why not? You're in Kirby's non verbal person trust yet he carved as much as any of you, but just give her some space. You know, you can't keep saying we told you sell it because if you make her feel dumb, she just doubles down and tries to prove towards south and it wasn't done. Here are the show

Speaker 1:          07:19          professors unambiguous disdain for trunk, but seems to be urging the liberal media to be less condescending toward trump voters. Less eager to feel smug and say, I told you so. The girls should have heated kyle's warning because their comments during dinner made Heidi run right back to carbon.

Speaker 2:          07:36          I think maybe I am just stupid and I don't know what I want and it ends up partying. People. No, you need to know something. None of this is your fault

Speaker 1:          07:47          at this moment and isolated, insecure Heidi is prime to believe whatever radical, bigoted garbage carbon wants to serve up, presumably like the voters she's come to represent and a surprisingly well quaffed kyle is in for a surprise. Just as trump has convinced his base to blame the left for everything that goes wrong with his presidency. Carmen is convinced Heidi to make kyle her well, Jewish scape goat.

Speaker 2:          08:12          You can't help it. It's how you were raised, what you were tying. My heritage is Irish, so I'm prone to being moody and your heritage. You know, you can be a little sneaky sometimes and not even realize it.

Speaker 1:          08:25          Now a word on this episode's treatment of antisemitism. Of course, Jew jokes have been carbons, bread and butter since before Kenny's first death.

Speaker 2:          08:32          Yeah. Hi. Okay. Yeah, you'll have that by got Kobe fat.

Speaker 1:          08:37          This episode felt a little different. Hardy's final speech to kyle is pretty shocking. It's not loaded with the usual overt punchlines. All we get is kyle looking pretty devastating.

Speaker 2:          08:48          Dude, did she just call me a dirty Jew? South Park's mockery of antisemites has never looked so dark, which may be the shows way

Speaker 1:          08:56          of acknowledging how fundamentally different Hartman's character sounds since the rise of the alt right has southpark consciously graduated from goofy, childish bigotry to genuinely ugly bigotry. It seems like it. In the meanwhile, things are worse than ever. Heidi is now completely controlled by Cartman and the Republicans and the nation are going to get with an even bigger strap on. Things are looking pretty bleak, but what do you guys think? We'll regretful trump voters be shamed right back into his voting base or even worse. Is there any hope for Heidi Paul Ryan or any of us?
