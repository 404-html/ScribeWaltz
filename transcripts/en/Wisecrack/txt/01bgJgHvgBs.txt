Speaker 1:          00:10          That was the vision of literature for six a all the time. Uh, I don't think I'm a very exceptional case because simply in our daily life we approached sex either as a pleasure or as a tool, uh, for literature six, uh, that would say even I don't like very much the term six. I would say the physical relation, right. Then the physical relationship between, I mean, between two partners are in lethbridge means much more because you need sex not only for pleasure, sometimes you need, uh, to, to, to perform a physical relation with your partner because you are scared or because you are disparate or because you are looking for intimacy or because you want to be protected by a mother, for example, a order, uh, you would like to discover your partner or to take control many things.

Literature is many things more than just the pleasure you see or you achieved the pleasure through many, many roads. You see, uh, it is, it is an art. It is a way to express yourself. It is even a way to discover the world. It is a way to discover your partner. I don't think that you know really your partner without having sex with him or with her. You see, because this is one, it's a moment of truth. You see, and you could discover your feelings after having the physical relation much better than before. You see what is left. You see in the few seconds after the pleasure, the physical pleasure, then you discover exactly how much you feel for this person. You see, it's very, very mysterious and reach moment and accordingly. It's a big challenge for a fixture.
