Speaker 1:          00:05          When you look at public opinion, one of the clearest markers of how dramatically things have shifted as the number of people who say that they know an openly gay or lesbian person. Uh, back in 1985, it was 24% of Americans who said they knew, uh, uh, open gay or lesbian person, uh, by last year that had shifted up to 88%. And so, um, you know, we actually dedicated the book, it's a statistics book. We dedicated the book to a, an unknown number, which is the number of people who have had the courage to come out. Um, and that's an impossible number to documenter or quantify, but I think it is the starting point for the revolutionary progress that has been made. Um, you know, Harvey Milk and other pioneers of gay and Lesbian Liberation made that basic point that coming out was a first step towards greater equality because visibility would lead straight Americans to understand and accept and embrace and an advocate for equality for lgbt folks.

Speaker 1:          01:17          And so this movement toward acceptance I think is completely intertwined with the growing visibility and the openness and honesty that lgbt folks have embraced. The, I do think data collection and, and uh, the dissemination of, of survey results and polls, um, is really important. Um, at the same time, I think, um, you know, if we're talking about what the single most important factor might be in, in terms of the revolution toward greater equality for lgbt people, um, I think you, you got to look at the media and the, the idea that media portrayals have shifted so dramatically. Um, that's one of my favorite chapters in the book actually. I'm the section on film and TV and other forms of media, um, which when you look at early television portrayals in the seventies and eighties, um, there were occasional gay and lesbian characters, but generally the laughing stock of any given show and the, you know, the very first gay couple, um, was on a norman lear a series called hot l Baltimore about this hotel in Baltimore.

Speaker 1:          02:28          Um, that program wasn't even broadcast in Baltimore and it was canceled after a handful of episodes. And it was proceeded by this warning, um, you know, to, to make sure parents didn't allow their children to be corrupted by the, uh, morally questionable content. And so you fast forward from that to something like will and grace or the ellen degeneres show where you have open gay and lesbian characters. I'm actually living their lives and people can quibble. Um, and I think for good reason with some of the portrayals. But when you look at the overall trend, just the very fact that mainstream television and network television is showing and embracing, um, healthy gay characters in committed relationships and a, a really, uh, positive light. I do think that has been fundamental to the changes we've seen. And then I also think that the ongoing collection of data through organizations like Gallup and the Williams Institute, um, is, is also fundamental in terms of reminding people that there is this trend towards greater acceptance. And I think one, you know, that, that, that growing acceptance as reflected by the numbers leads people to be more open with pollsters. So that if the Gallup's numbers on, you know, should same sex activity be legal as those numbers go up or should same sex marriage, um, be be illegalized as those numbers go up. Um, I think that reporting in turn encourages people to reveal their inner support. So there is a trend and a cycle whereby growing awareness and growing reporting of this awareness leads to greater acceptance.
