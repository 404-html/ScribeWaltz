Speaker 1:          00:00          This video is brought to you by Wix,

Speaker 1:          00:06          a wise crack. Jared here, Jack is back. That means it's time to saddle up and head back to the strange and depressing world of Hollywood. Now we've already talked about Frodo narrative and distraction in previous videos, but this season really dives deep into an idea that's always been present in the show, that idea loneliness, who's comfortable with it, who's uncomfortable with it, and who takes 100 painkillers a day to avoid it at all costs through its ensemble of dysfunctional relationships. Bojack gives us a fresh and quite nuanced perspective on loneliness, not often seen on TV. Can loneliness be healthy or even necessary? Well, let's find out in this wisecrack quick take on bojack horseman season five and of course spoilers ahead, but real quick, a shadow tour, new channels sponsor wicks. We're building a new website using wix that we'll have a bunch of fun and interactive features, including a way for you to vote on what we should cover in an upcoming episode.

Speaker 1:          01:00          So more on that at the end of the video, but for now, back to bojack. So first guys, a quick recap. This season revolves around the production of bojack's new TV show, Filbert, where bojack navigates a semi relationship with his Costar, Gina. Meanwhile, Princess Carolyn attempts to adopt a baby. Todd manages his career as a VP at what time is it right now, dot com and Mr. peanut butter and Diane finalized their divorce in an attempt to move on with their lives as early as the first line. Willingness is established as a central theme of the season. Nothing lonelier than a party. Good thing. I don't need anyone or I might feel lonesome and as we'll see, every major character struggles with this in their own way. Let's start with the most obvious one. Diane, who is struggling to reconcile her identity as a newly divorced single woman. We've seen in previous seasons how hard she used to try to keep up with Mr. peanut butter's expectation speed. A fun party goer like him having to find herself in relation to him for so long, only made her focus on her supposedly shortcomings as an introvert while abandoning other aspects of herself that she actually liked.

Speaker 2:          02:05          This is all the stuff that cool, 20 something Diane had to put away when she moved in with old man peanut butter.

Speaker 1:          02:10          In episode two, we follow her non sequentially across a timeline that starts with her hitting on bojack.

Speaker 2:          02:15          You could totally make out right now

Speaker 1:          02:17          during a moment of lonely desperation. Then after finding out that Mr peanut butter has a new girlfriend, she flees to Vietnam for a solo trip. Once there she's rendered doubly alone by her inability to speak Vietnamese and her fellow Americans assumptions that she doesn't speak English. You Viet Nam.

Speaker 2:          02:33          No me, America.

Speaker 1:          02:35          She copes with her loneliness in various ways. At one point, engaging in a mega brief romance with a grip, but every interaction puts Diane Moore Ilities from a conversation with todd about something. I'm supposed to go to the roller rink later. Hopefully there won't be any mob bosses there. What am I saying? That's so random to the grips. Endless pontification. Diane realizes often interacting with the outside world only leaves her feeling more alone. She eventually comes to terms with her romantic aloneness, apologizing to bojack for her mixed messages and admitting that I just really need a friend right now over the course of the season, she seems increasingly self actualized from being able to comfort her romantic semi rival pickles to performing a solo intervention for bojack. Now more on that later, generally she's able to exist more truthfully now that she's not dating someone who doesn't align with our values. Even her therapist admits that

Speaker 3:          03:30          sounds like our time together is done. What fact that you're setting a boundary is good. Go forth with the tools that I've given you

Speaker 1:          03:38          through Diane. We see that self sufficiency and embracing solitude can be key to realizing the truest, strongest version of yourself. Now, while Diane is able to be happily alone, other characters attempt to make relationships work in order to avoid confronting loneliness. Just as Diane's relationship with Mr. peanut butter makes her obsess over her fun quotient. Todd's relationship seemed to only bring out his two shortcomings. First, in his relationship with Yolanda, todd is hurt by the hyperfocused on his lack of life direction. Why did you tell her

Speaker 3:          04:08          family? I went to college. Um, I dunno. I guess I just wanted you to seem impressive.

Speaker 1:          04:13          Ultimately he decides to end the relationship. Yolanda, we need to break up. Second. He's so eager to make things work with emily that he constructs a sex robot, which he is convinced could compensate for his disinterest in sex. While emily isn't super into boning the sex robot, the big wigs at what time is it right now. Dot Com are impressed by its Moxie and the robot is ultimately promoted to CEO. Todd ultimately destroys the sexual robot and takes off his executive suit, thereby eliminating the parts of himself that we're trying to please Yolanda and emily. As with Diane Todd's interactions. Show how some romantic relationships can leave you feeling more alone and more. And now for Princess Carolyn in episode five, we get some deeper insights into her past learning how she went from being the helps knocked up daughter at the mercy of her boyfriend's answering machine tape dynasty only to miscarry and find herself on her own instead of mourning the life she lost. She created an entirely new one for herself by moving to La and clawing her way up the Hollywood ladder. It's worth noting that her latest journey and selfsufficiency also came after a miscarriage, the one that blew up her relationship with Milton. Once again, we see Princess Carolyn land on her feet and channel the same bravery as her teenage self and starting over after a difficult loss while sitting in the hospital waiting to meet her maybe baby. She admits to Milton that fourth season, Princess Carolyn did want him to stick around the night. She kicked him out.

Speaker 3:          05:41          I wish you'd stayed with me that night. Do you told me to leave? I guess the lesson is don't listen to me. Right.

Speaker 1:          05:49          However, later she clearly tells him to leave saying that she doesn't want to raise the baby with him, and this time she means it. She's what? She wants. Self sufficiency. For instance, Carolyn's joke about her baby's name, untitled Princess Carolyn project, so just that as with her previous career successes, Princess Carolyn will manage single motherhood just fine. All right, so Diane Todd and Princess Carolyn's journeys through season five illustrate various takes on that double edge sword of loneliness and self sufficiency, which brings us to Mr. peanut butter, Mr. peanut butter also fits this narrative because as the character most in need of company, he's also the least inclined to self reflections.

Speaker 4:          06:30          No, I'm not tough enough. I'll show them how tough I can be.

Speaker 1:          06:35          We'll be back with more of the red carpet pre show fashion stravaganza. Unlike the other characters, Mr. peanut butter rarely appears to want anything beyond fame, fun and parties. He seems physically incapable of being alone, getting with the first half his age dog lady he meets after signing his divorce papers as a serial monogamist. He made desperately hide from loneliness or self reflection, seeking solace in relationships the same way he seek solace in loud parties. In the Halloween episode, Mr. peanut butter gets dangerously close to introspection as he wonders how each of his wives became bitter and unhappy by the end of their relationship. What's the common denominator? Diane offers some insights.

Speaker 4:          07:17          You keep dating women in their twenties. I do do that are not fully formed yet. Life changes. People know about me.

Speaker 1:          07:25          The women he marries eventually grow up while Mr. peanut butter remains the same. It seems that in constantly dating women who are younger than him, Mr. peanut butter has carved out a convenient emotional niche he can continue to occupy as he replaces each consecutive life with a younger, more fun version. This safe paint by numbers approach to marriage has kept Mr. peanut butter happy but prevented him from maturing in any meaningful way. Ultimately, Mr peanut butter reveals himself to be truly pathological in his need to be coupled up when instead of telling pickles the truth about his infidelity and risking losing her, he decides to put a radio and finally our boy bojack. While Mr peanut butter may be needy, at least he's totally upfront about bojack. On the other hand, it has a more complex and more painful relationship to the outside world from Holly Holly Hawk in the middle of the night to inform her that he liked her on instagram.

Speaker 4:          08:18          Let you know that I started your instagram photo

Speaker 1:          08:20          to pretending to match Gina's blahzay. Take on the relationship. We work together, we make six together. We don't talk about her feelings and yet sometimes I've been grudging respect can blossom into blossoms, into nothing is when I was going to say you go bojack's need for human slash animal. Companionship is palpable. Pojoaque has gone the Mr. peanut butter route in the past, getting with women to avoid solitude, a a toxic pattern that peaked with the nears seduction of his ex girlfriends, teenage daughter. This season piece kind of dating these supremely Jaden, Gina, who doesn't appear to need anything from him emotionally. I love

Speaker 4:          08:54          being alone. I wish were alone right now, leaving him

Speaker 1:          08:56          just as lonely as before so he decides to bypass the whole learning to be alone with your thoughts thing by altering his state of being, enter painkillers writer Johann Hari makes a compelling case for considering drug addiction. As a disease of bonding. Humans have an innate primal need to bond and when they're unable to bond with other people, they'll bond with a negative behavior like smoking or gambling. Essentially, he argues that substance use is a substitute for meaningful human connection, and while researchers are also studying how other social and economic factors can influence addiction in the fictional world of bojack, loneliness seems like a closely, Oh, Jack Find Solace and drugs even as the embed him deeper into a fantasy world, increasingly cutting him off from the people around him. He begins to see friends and loved ones as tools for getting what he wants. Gina is a tool for helping him sees the limelight, and Hollyhock is a tool for helping him steal his pills back from Gina's medicine cabinet. Our sense of Bojack's loneliness is augmented by the Filbert TV show. Narrative. Gilbert is a hard boiled loaner detective with a penchant for secrets and grizzly voiceover.

Speaker 4:          10:03          Why do you still use a landline?

Speaker 1:          10:04          What am I supposed to tell her? I'm just an old fashioned guy, or maybe I like things that are plugged to the wall. Something to grab onto. If I start floating away from the opening lines of the series, bojack tries to imply that he relates to the character as a fellow loaner slash Sinek. This develops into an ongoing joke about the similarities between the two. The set of the show looks exactly like bojack's house and boat, constantly wearing his silver costume offset. It's a costume I. I just finished filming a show. Normally people return the costume. Also bojack frequently reach too deeply into his characters narrative despite reminders that it's not about you, you know, Filbert. By the end, he's become so dissociated, he's completely lost himself in the character, even the character filbert loses track of where he begins and ends inventing a make believe partner who he blamed for his wife's murder. Rather than taking responsibility for it,

Speaker 4:          10:56          there's no record of you ever having a partner at all.

Speaker 1:          10:58          You say you killed your wife and the chief and the coroner and the others. Similarly, bojack loses any distinction between himself and Filbert also because he can't cope with the horrible things he's done. The result of this disassociation bojack pretty much retreats into a fantasy world where he does crazy like choke. Gina. At one point, he comes face to face with the bloated balloon version of himself as if to illustrate the fact that his inability to face himself is ultimately to blame for all of his problems. In an interesting moment in the season finale, bojack begs diane to write one of her Internet takedowns of him. He wants everyone to know about his worst behavior. He wants to be despised, chastise, and punished. Here bojack craves the feeling of being held accountable by the world for the same exact reason he craves it's company praise and romantic attention because he has no consistent sense of self. He needs the world to reconcile his persona as lovable Hollywood, leading man and narcissistic creep because he can't seem to do it on his own. A soap actualized, Diane is no longer interested in playing bojack's games and diagnosis is request for what it is self serving. Eventually, Diane convinces him, but the only person whose job it is to hold him accountable. He is himself. I am asking to be held accountable

Speaker 5:          12:20          and I'm telling you, it's not going to happen. Whatever you put in that story, no one is going to hold you accountable. You need to take responsibility for yourself

Speaker 1:          12:28          and faster than UPC. Narcotics anonymous. She's persuaded him to go to Rehab, so what are we to take from bojack season five? It cannot rely on other people. Bojack, well, not quite. Oh, Jack and his dad's certainly know how to put a pessimistic spin, our relationships, but we shouldn't buy into their bleakest insights. While we can't hide ourselves in the company of others, we have options beyond live and die alone. While romantic relationships may fail or prove toxic, it's the platonic friendships that radiate through season five, whether it's the budding roommate hood between todd and Princess Carolyn, or the lasting bond between Diane and bojack. They may have their ups and downs and stolen cheese sticks, but they prove uniquely enduring. Bojack starts the season claiming he doesn't need anyone, but he ends up knowing there's one person who you can count on his friend Diane.

Speaker 1:          13:17          So what do you guys think? Are we all alone in the world?
