Speaker 1:          00:02          Marshall goldsmith, author, what got you here won't get you there. Well, I just wrote a story about this and Harvard Business Online. Now I'll give you a few tips on American Airlines alone. I have nine point 5 million frequent flyer miles. I'm the highest level flyer on united. I've got a gold card on British air, Yada, Yada, Yada. I'm like constantly. Few tips. Number One, forget where you've been and be where you are. This is a Buddhist. One of the worst things you can do when you travel is focus on what time is it in Kentucky? What time is it where I started? Who Cares? You're not there. You're here. Another guideline is force yourself to sleep and I find it's very handy. I wear the little things that put over my eyes. I put the blanket over my head, go to sleep. I sleep on airplanes. By the way, the other one I always use.

Speaker 1:          00:57          Very bizarre. Looking on a long flight. I was put the blanket over my head when I sleep. What it does is you say, I speak constantly as a for my job. Well, if you fly in an eight hour flight and you sleep, you breathe deeply, that dry air hits the back of your throat and you get a sore throat. If you put the blanket over your head, it holds in your buddy moisture and you don't get a sore throat. And you know what? I found very few people talk to you when you have the blanket over your head. In fact sometimes two people sitting next to you leave. It's all good, right? So you just put the blanket over your head, you sleep and then don't drink on the airplane. The only time I drank as if I'm on an eight hour flight, I want to sleep.

Speaker 1:          01:38          I have one or two glasses of wine before I go to bed for a long period of time, but in general don't drink on the airplane exercise when you get off the plane if you can. And the other thing is just make peace with what is. And also I eat before I get on the plane. I don't eat on the plate. If you get on the plane, two or three hours gets blown while they're slowly bringing food back and forth and you have this sort of used plate sitting in front of you there for a half hour, you know, and the airport's. Everybody complains about flight number one. Almost always flown more than me. How many days have I missed because of flying in 30 years one. So the system works better than people like to give it credit for. I, I, I almost always get to where I'm going.

Speaker 1:          02:24          Right? So the system actually works. People complain about the food, don't eat it, don't eat the food and always good make you didn't cost that much. And the one thing that has gotten better is the food at the airport, put it. The airport says 20 times better than it was. I flew 30 years ago. The food was hideous. Thirty years ago. You had no choice. It was overpriced. Much better today. So make the best of it. I think a lot of it is just your attitude. Be where you are and make peace. If you don't want to travel, don't travel. If you're going to travel, don't whine about it. Oh, the other thing is, I have to say I annoyed by very little in life. One thing I do find it even annoys me is people being rude to flight attendants. The plane is like or yelling at the flight attendant.

Speaker 1:          03:10          It's not the flight attendants fault. They can't make the plane take off, you know, shut up. Just sit there and you know, read a book, bring a book. That's another good thing. Brings something you want to read. Bring a book, sit there and make peace. It is what it is. You don't have to annoy everyone around. You just shut up, right? Just go with it and if you do that, it tends to work a lot better. I went to Africa. One thing, it helps me in a very odd way. In 1984, I went to Africa with the American Red Cross famine relief campaign and I watched a lot of people starve to death and I came home. You know what I said, don't complain because the airplane's late. There are people out there starving to death. Don't complain because the airplanes late every, it sounds kind of trivial, but every time I get on an airplane, you know what I think, who cares? How serious is this? I'm not starving to death. I'm not going to die here. Why am I wasting my life getting angry about this stuff you can't control it. Make peace with.

Speaker 1:          04:14          Well, I'll tell you, there's one way in my field, it's helped a lot and I've got a good friend named cal wick has put together this followup system. A lot of what I do in coaching is followup. They've got some really great electronic followup systems that people have developed up. Who did you talk to? What did you learn? What are you going to do about it? Are these ongoing sense of reminders and follow up and it works really, really well if people do it, and again, it's a really positive use of technology to help people get better.

Speaker 1:          04:48          Well, I mean, I think new technology is part of life and one of the keys for being the leader of the future is technological savvy. Most of what I learned is it goes back to basic Buddhist philosophy of accept what is the past is the past. We can all have these little nostalgic Lonnie longings for the past, but you know what? It's gone now. I have a 61 corvette, which is a beautiful car, just beautiful white with a red coat, you know, very spiffy looking. Everybody talks about how great the cars were in the past though they weren't. They were awful. They broke down all the time. Their breaks were terrible. You can buy a $12,000 car today. It's far better than any car you could have bought the past. We just have these memories about the past as if it were this wonderful time. Well, the past people forget.

Speaker 1:          05:29          We used to have things like racism and sexism and we had a lot of things in a password. Not so wonderful that today they are much better now. Those kinds of things are much better than they used to be. So I think the main thing is make peace with what is. And you are where you are. So you're here now. So now we have lots of technology, so make peace with lots of technology. On the other hand, to me, what's not an acceptable option is to say, well, I don't like that stuff. That stuff is part of life. Yeah, that's fast past. I was part of life. You could make peace. You know, it's there. Everybody's using it. You've got to learn how to use technology or else you're just lost.
