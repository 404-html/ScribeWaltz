Speaker 1:          00:03          Hey wisecrack, corporeal, jared again, since destiny two dropped. We've been grinding over public events, the crucible and strikes, oddly enough, while playing and amazing thing happened. There's an actual narrative to follow this time. Sure. The original had all the gramar cards, but seriously time for that. This time we get a glimpse into the motivation of the Games and Agnes, and it's not simple. We're binge delusions of grandeur or monomaniacal madness. Nope. The main villain of destiny two is driven by the same thing that people run on now, pride and and woken list wisecrack quick take on destiny two and as usual spoilers ahead. First things first, a quick recap. Destiny two opens with dominance gall, also known as Gary Today. No one is main is scary, or is it something with a j. The military leader of the cabal and his crew, the Red Legion assaulting the tower, the last real city on earth dominance and his crew up steel, the mystical light of the traveler, a giant planet shape God and kidnap the travelers speaker who is a prophet of sorts, you play as a guardian and are now screwed because without the travelers light, you've become a mere mortal, so you have to travel the galaxy to restore the travelers light and defeat dominance.

Speaker 1:          01:20          Destiny has always been filled with Judeo Christian illusions and undertones. The guardians are corpses brought back to life with the travelers light like Christian Salvation and resurrection and the game all but says the travelers, a god that sacrifices itself for the greater good of the universe. All of the crucifixion. It's sacrificed, destroyed. It's ancient enemy and brought light to the ghosts. The main character's, the guardians of the travelers light may as well be the guardians of God's defined light, Aka his heavenly choir of angels. Get it. Guardian angels. This light business is a pretty big theme in destiny. The guardians are literally powered by light, and when you die in destiny two, we see your light fades away and what's the opposite of light? Well, darkness still not buying the biblical connection. Consider this passage. Ben spake Jesus again unto them saying, I am the light of the world.

Speaker 1:          02:12          Either follow with me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life. The evil that the traveler fled in the original destiny was the darkness. When you dive in destiny, you saw the darkness consumed you. The loss of light is the central theme in destiny. Destiny two gets a little more specific and borrows heavily from a 340 year old epic poem by John Milton. Paradise Lost Milton's poem traces the fall of Man and follow Satan on his journey to get revenge on God by corrupting his newly created paradise and its inhabitants, Adam and eve. Destiny two seems inspired by one of Milton's central motifs, the juxtaposition of light and dark. Milton's angels are represented as light because of the goodness and illumination of God's grace. Meanwhile, the demons are described by a darkness and their absence of light dominance. Gall in a way plays the role of Satan who's angel name was Lucifer or Latin for light bearer and goal is pretty fixated on sealing the travelers light traveler, speaker.

Speaker 1:          03:13          While the parallels between God and Satan are intriguing, they're pretty essential to understanding who you're fighting. According to the lead designer of destiny to Luke Smith Gall is motivated by a sort of inferiority complex. Gall was an orphan space turtle raised to believe that the traveler messed up when he chose humanity. Gol was taught to believe that he is the greatest thing in the universe since Nutella. He's here because he believes the traveler and choosing us made the wrong choice and destiny to gall intends to show the traveler the error of its ways. It shouldn't be surprising that this is also Satan's motivation and paradise lost. Lucifer is pissed that he was skipped over for that big promotion. God gave the number two slot to his son, and so he plots to burn down heaven and tempt man to turn away from God. Gulpie comparison is pissed. The traveler chose the guardians so he kicks them out of the tower and tries to bend the traveler to his will, the center of your God.

Speaker 1:          04:20          One thing that seems odd about goals, motivation is the console galls, adoptive father keeps telling him to stop messing around with the speaker and just to take the light what is right and take this eventually all kills the console and the speaker and takes the light. If he took the light anyway, why the hell did he kill the console? Why did he wait so long? The answer is complicated, but to simplify, Gol was holding out for recognition is seeking affection and love from a God, but in a messed up way. Recognition has a long philosophical tradition, but we're going to talk about what it means for our old friend, advil helm, Hagle for Hagle. People desire a self, a sort of consciousness or what some people call subjectivity, and there are all sorts of steps that people take to achieve subjectivity. Recognition takes place primarily through vision and in order for recognition to occur, both subjects need to feel like one another are worthy of recognition.

Speaker 1:          05:16          Most people aren't reassured by a thumbs up from Charles Manson because it doesn't exactly scream you're doing the right thing, but a thumbs up from a role model or a God, well that gives you all the warm and fuzzies. Gall is searching for validation from what he considers to be an equal because well goal is basically a god given that he is the emperor of the cabal. Golf motivation for recognition comes from the fact that he was a runt and an orphan who was cast aside and abandoned even giant space. Turtles have low self esteem. I guess dominance hopes that in decimating the Guardian's he will show the traveler that he's deserving of the light and he'll be recognized as a true subject worthy of protecting the light. He's willing to do pretty much anything like [inaudible]. I crucify the speaker in order to get that sweet light or really got like immortality. He'll even blow up the sun. Fourth Gall believes he is worthy because all the sacrifice that he's gone through because the guardians were just picked willy nilly in destiny. One goal doesn't believe the guardians have sacrificed anything,

Speaker 1:          06:26          and in a way gall is right. I mean the guardians were endowed with immortality at random. They don't have any fear of death. They didn't pull themselves up by their space, boots or anything. They just sort of got lucky. We're makes your guardians worthy of devotion. Self sacrifice. Speaker is the face of devotion sacrifice, so when the speaker tells him that the traveler has never spoken to him and that there's no chance in hell he will ever get the light golf flips out, kills the speaker and takes any way, even though golf said word for word, I will not take the light or a remote force too, so would be twisted faith.

Speaker 1:          07:21          It's here. That goal becomes the villain of Destin. Once he killed the console and the speaker and takes the light. He rejects the recognition model that Governs Hegel's ethics and go straight to thievery and university domination in a full circle moment. He replicates Satan's biggest sin, the Hubris to believe that he could ever be an equal to God. So when goal is killed in the last fight and resurrects as a giant marshmallow God thing, he has to ask if the traveler finally recognizes him, if he finally sees him, but the traveler can't see him. So there you have a tale of Hubris and recognition. Personally, I love the strong narrative component of destiny too, but I also love just aimlessly walking around killing stuff and picking up loot. I love the microtransactions a little less, but what do you guys think? Should the game stick to the basics or explore more of these themes in the future?
