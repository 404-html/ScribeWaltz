Speaker 1:          00:03          Hey guys, jared again. Today we're talking about your favorite little town in Colorado. Yup. South Park for the past three seasons. The show's ditched at signature standalone episodes and embrace season long serialization and it's largely been awesome. Season 19 brilliantly blended themes of pc culture advertising and gentrification over a multi episode arc. And most recently season 20 kicked off with an even more ambitious storyline that juggled the presidential election, member berries, a militant feminist Hartman, a girl hating Dick flashing butters, and a whole lot of internet trolling. It all seem to be leading up to some epic conclusion. And then everything just fizzles out into confusion convolution and only they just blew up the internet. So why did season 20 leave us feeling all itchy and uncertain like a fourth grade school wide outbreak of Lice had just surface? Well, we have an idea and it all has to do with Matt and trey secret sauce that makes South Park's writing. So good. Welcome to this wisecrack condition on South Park. Season 20 what went wrong? And as always, spoilers ahead. Watching south park feels like peering inside the mind of the world's funniest stoner. It's unpredictable, imaginative, and completely unhinged in the best way possible. But make no mistake, there's a strict order to the madness. The show is constructed with one rigid plotline rule.

Speaker 2:          01:25          We found out this really simple rule that maybe you guys have all heard before. We can take these beats, which are basically the beats of your outline and if the words and then belong between those beats, you're

Speaker 1:          01:37          for instance, here's a three plot storyline about stick figure. John John Adopts a stray dog and then John wins the lottery and then John becomes a scientologists. John's story has a sucky narrative because there is no cause and effect. You could rearrange each action into any order and it would remain a random series of events in the life of a lottery winning dog, rescuing intro level scientologists. So what makes good southpark approved writing and whenever you can replace your andwith, buts or therefores, it makes for better, right? Take South Park's famous Mormon episode and annoyingly perfect Mormon kid moves to town. Therefore heat pisses everyone off. Therefore stand decides to kick his ass, but the kid is so nice that he tell standing, go ahead and beat him up. Therefore, Stan doesn't beat him up and said he agrees to go to the kid's house for dinner. Notice how each action that begins with therefore or but indicates a consequence or reaction to the previous action.

Speaker 1:          02:33          Every pot point matters, which is why the show never loses momentum. Okay, so that's south park's golden rule, but before we dive into what went wrong with season 20 it's time to talk about the orange tinted elephant in the room. Yup. The president of the United States stone in Parker had been upfront about the fact that like 99% of the pollsters, they expected Turd Sandwich to win the election and plan the series around that outcome. They had to do desperate minute read rights in order to Aaron episode the day after the election, so not ideal. As soon as giant Douche, Mr. Garrison wins the election, the show starts breaking the creator's core rules and getting them all put Dab as seen in the two main plotlines member berries and trolling. Let's map out the member berries. Plotline randy tries member barry's false into eight and install jic transcend things.

Speaker 1:          03:23          Get a little dark room. I ran excel model not full times. Therefore, Randy realizes member berries are dangerous, brainwashing germs with the what's going on with these member berries. Meanwhile, Mr. Garrison along with his vp, Caitlyn Jenner is leading in the polls, but he realizes he doesn't have a plan to carry out his campaign promises and we'll look like a jackass if he wins. What the hell do I do? If I win, I won't be able to do what I promised. Therefore, Mr. Garrison spends the first half of the series trying to sabotage his campaign so hillary will win. I don't know what the I'm doing. I've got to come clean. I, I had no idea I would get this far, but the fact of the matter is I should not be president, but his voters catch on and demand an explanation. Therefore, Randy tells garrison the truth about his popularity.

Speaker 1:          04:11          When the world is changing so fast, it makes us yearn for the old ways. When life seemed simpler, but it doesn't mean those old ideas are good for us now. Therefore, the two of them set out to destroy member berries, but quickly realized that these little guys just won't die. Therefore, randy convinces Mr Carish to give a heartfelt speech denouncing nostalgia on November 8th you must vote against me and show the world that you didn't think the new star wars was all that good. And there you have it. A perfect half season set up. Ray Hilary victory that follows the golden rule of southpark storytelling. Except newsflash, hilary lost.

Speaker 1:          04:55          Suddenly they have to justify garrison surprising when and that's when things get messy. Now, south park has to improvise it's way through the rest of the season and the writers start to break their own storytelling rules. We go from a strictly but or therefore based plot, tweet, big cluster of and bed starting with. And then Mr. Garrison winds anyway out of nowhere. And then Kaitlin Barfs, reinfecting, Mr. Garrison and randy with member berries. So Randy and garrison trip out on the stall. Jah, forget their quest to destroy member berries and generally get stoked on garrison's victory. This presses the rewind button on the plot, watching them unlearn the perils of the storage. It is literally narrative back pedaling. Also, you have this nagging feeling that it should take more than a bit of Berry flavored nostalgia to explain garrison split second transformation from terrified self sabotaging presidential candidate to the cocky leader of the free world there today on there whose hair? It's the president of the United States. From here, the member barry storyline just generally gets muddled. At the beginning of the season, they had a clear purpose to set up a physical embodiment of the toxic nostalgia that will eventually be overcome like the human adds in the earlier season. They start out as lazy, intoxicating berries and then they magically turned into a weird vomit inducing virus and then they stop by at 1920s nightclub in a brief side story that seems quickly forgotten and then we find out they're Nazis.

Speaker 3:          06:24          Mama Stan Jubril's not nurse to your base. Real old lines people line a maybe that got our men being

Speaker 1:          06:34          also pals with Vladimir Putin and by the end they're ultimately looking like a tiny fruit militia. Ultimately, the show doesn't offer any justification for the member berries transformation. Instead we get a random progression of events that build without any apparent logic and that's just not the south park emo. Now onto another sub plot that got tangled up by a trump win trolling for most of the season. We watched Kyle's Dad Gerald living his best life as the wine. Oh trolls skank hunt 42 this initially conforms with the South Park philosophy of story structure. Gerald's trolling angers the Danes. Therefore the Danes threatened to release everyone's Internet history, sending Gerald Cartman South Park and the world into a panic. Enter Hillary Clinton who's confidence she's about to win the presidency, but she finds out trolled trace might leak her online activities. Therefore she needs who is gang hunt 42 we believe he's the only one who can save you then crap.

Speaker 1:          07:33          She loses the election and again, the narrative structure starts to crumble without her presidency to defend. Clinton doesn't have any real reason to recruit Gerald's slash skank hunt 42 and then confusingly Clinton recruits him anyway with a vague mission. He needs to infiltrate troll trace to protect US secrets. We want to send someone into Denmark undercover and steal their technology. This entire scene of Hillary meeting Gerald below the bridge feel super weird and disjointed, almost like it's from an alternate reality. That's because it probably was recycled material from the original. If Hillary had one version of the episode, it's certainly what fit the south park role of storytelling. A newly elected hillary is afraid of having compromising emails released by troll trace. Therefore, she recruits Gerald to take down the dates. Gerald wants to stop troll trace from revealing his secret identity anyway. Therefore, he agrees to go and delete the evidence and save both of them from exposure.

Speaker 1:          08:30          But in this strange new president garrison run world that can't fly. So in a desperate attempt to salvage the plotline, the show reveals that Clinton's claim was merely a ruse and she's actually just helping the Danes kidnap American trolls in exchange for the protection of her email. And then oops, turns out they're just trolling the American trolls they capture and then this top Danish guy wasn't trying to punish the trolls. He's also just a giant troll trolling the world for the loans and also he's not even in Danish. Did your brain just melt? If so, it's probably because South Park abandoned its most basic narrative premise. None of the events in the trolling narrative actually build off previous actions. They're just a seemingly random, increasingly complicated laundry list of plot points. The show writers openly complained about the narrative hold they dug for themselves.

Speaker 4:          09:25          Come on, this is South Park. What's happened? You less? We used to have a challenging deal with it. They move onto the next one. Now we've just been dealing with trolling of Internet stuff over and over week after week and I don't know about you, but I get pretty sick of it.

Speaker 1:          09:38          It almost feels like the Danish guys announcement that he's just trolling the world is a last ditch effort to rescue the narrative. Maybe this is like the new post funny era of satire. Just like Mr. Garrison when he's drunk on member berries, a completely nihilistic troll doesn't need plot consistency. From there, the writers need to wrap up a few incompletes storylines, most notably the risks cartman and Gerald face from having their internet history reveal so they commit plot Hari Cari, by blowing everything up. That's right. Everybody from Kyle's little brother Ike to the top generals at the Pentagon collaborate to take down the Internet with a massive blitz of trolling and a little help from Elon Musk space x program. By blowing up the internet and deleting everybody's ugly a secrets, they also destroy the cause and effect relationship that isn't building up all season instead of a satisfying conclusion where things get resolved, audiences just get a big old psych.

Speaker 1:          10:32          We're blowing everything up. Before that, the season had done such a good job of analyzing the way the Internet has fragmented our public and private selves. How this sense of privacy has given us all the ability to behave like assholes without the people we love ever having to find out. This was all building up to a really promising conclusion, but we never got it. The show also brilliantly skewers the outrage cycles that dominate Internet culture as trolls expertly push our buttons. This kind of simmering outrage actually seems like a more interesting explanation for Mr Garrison's victory. Then member berries, the show never develops this idea aside from giving it one quick shout out during the finale tribers axiom, trevor's axiom is a well known equation in online trolling. It's a way in which one person can create a massive reaction on the Internet all bringing up the worst in humanity.

Speaker 1:          11:22          That sort of sounds like how I got elected because Matt and Trey Thought Hillary would win. They spent the first half of the season teasing the perils of having your internet history exposed, but since trump won hillary's emails exposing her are no longer as relevant as say the outrage cycles on social media. So what might season 20 of south park have looked like in a parallel universe where the Turd sandwich triumphs? Haven't you seen the polls? It's president elect senators or according to a deadline interview with stone and Parker viewers. Got a sneak peek in the postelection episode. Bill Clinton and bill cosby joined forces to announce their new South Park is gentleman's club and obvious hangover from me if Hillary, one version of the episode later Bill Confides in butters that the club was actually a place for men to hide because

Speaker 5:          12:07          trust me, my wife is a crazy bitch. She and all the other women in the world are about to get payback and we are all completely,

Speaker 1:          12:20          Parker says that in the alternate reality season 20 they would have focused on bill settling into his new role as the apparently terrified first gentlemen of the u s it would have been a fitting way to escalate the battle of the sexes already underway at South Park Elementary. It also would have given a lot more pointing seat to Carmen's newly inspired fear of his girlfriend Heidi, who he suspects is trying to destroy him instead. The first gentleman's club is understandably abandoned. So what does the future hold for South Park? Well, the creators warrant being subtle when they called the last episode of season 20 the end of civilization as we know it, if they're really leaving serialization behind, let's kind of a bummer because as messy as season 20 was, there was a lot of promise and in our humble opinion, they did some of their best work at the decade in seasons 18 and 19 why let a silly election between a giant Douche in a Turd Sandwich ruin all that? So what did you guys think is he's in 20 let us know what you think in the comments. Thanks for watching guys. He thanks for watching wise crack.
