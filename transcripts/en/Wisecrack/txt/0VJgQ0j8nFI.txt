Speaker 1:          00:06          We humans live on earth that we all know and we can look up at the stars there, stars that are close to us and our stars that are further away belonging to other galaxies and the stars that are extremely far away belonging to extremely far away galaxies. Now for about a century. We know that we see that far away. Galaxies which are islands of billions of stars, far away. Galaxies seemed to move away from us. We see that the light that reaches us coming from those galaxies is what they, what the scientists called red shifted meaning something has been stretched in between those galaxies and us. What has been stretched is the distance that separates us from those galaxies. As time goes by, all the distances in space stretch, they expand. That's what we call the expansion of the universe. It is not actually that those faraway stars or get x, he's moved away from us.

Speaker 1:          01:14          It is the distance itself that increases. There is more space and time in between them now than there was before. Just to make that point clear, that's when you, when you are from on earth and look at the stars, the expansion of the universe makes all the far away galaxies look as if they were moving away, but if you imagined that you were living somewhere else in another galaxy far away and the universe from there, all the stars and galaxies that are far away would again be moving away from you. To summarize, the expansion of the universe means that distances increase with time. That's not something that is completely crazy to understand. If you imagine that the universe started with the big bang, meaning that everything we can see in outer space right now was condensed in a very much smaller volume a long time ago.

Speaker 1:          02:15          Then somehow some energy got released and everything expended. Okay, do you universe group, but if you think about that carefully, what that means is that somehow this expansion, these blow up, this big bang thing should slow down with time. When you have an explosion on earth, the objects that are thrown away, they slow down because there is friction because there is something happening. Objects don't keep moving in flying forever. They slow down in the universe. It should be the same. In some sense, gravity should keep things from moving too far away from one another. If is enough gravity. For instance, the expansions should slow down after a while, but there you go. In 1998, uh, astronomers discovered that it is actually the other way around in space looking at far away galaxies, they, they realized that the expansion, the rate of expansion is accelerating. So there is a forest pushing away.

Speaker 1:          03:23          The faraway galaxy is faster and faster with time, and that's something that gravity can not explain. Gravity pulls things back towards one another. And this accelerated expansion means that there is another force before that has been called dark energy. This discovery of dark energy, of the accelerated expansion of our universe did change something already in the way we picture the future of our universe for a long time since we know of the Big Bang, there were basically two possibilities for the future of our universe. The first one is that there is so much matter in that that despite the expansion, gravity would work like some kind of rubber band and would bring everything back into what we call a big crunch, that the everything will be pulled, two words each other at some stage, and the expansion would go the other way around and we would have the the precise opposite as the big bang, which was called the big crunch. The discovery of the accelerated expansion kind of ruled that possibility out in the sense that gravity will never be strong enough to pull things back into a big crunch. We are the. We are more into a scenario in which our universe will keep expanding, will keep being getting bigger and bigger forever. That is what we can expect as of today for the future of our universe.
