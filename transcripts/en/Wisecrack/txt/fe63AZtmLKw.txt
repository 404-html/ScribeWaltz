Hey guys, jared here and today we're diving back into black mirror. The fourth season of this modern twilight zone just dropped on Netflix and with it some truly thought provoking episodes including a loving homage to star trek and Apache helicopter parents, and they rather utopian alternative to tinder in the wake of season three super popular San Junipero. The show has traded it's trademark pessimism for a slightly more positive tone, injecting a measure of justice and happiness previously unseen in the series, but it's in the season finale where the show does something drastically different. Black Museum not only provides the high concept technological nightmare that we've come to expect, but reflects on the legacy and function of the show. As a whole, black museum asks, what is even the purpose of Black Mirror?

Speaker 1:          00:56          Welcome this wise crack quick take on the philosophy of black museum and obviously spoilers ahead. The episode follows a young woman named niche as she's given a private tour by proprietor Rolo Haynes of the eponymous black museum, a tourist trap that houses a collection of authentic criminological artifacts. Viewers will be sure to spot a number of prominent props from past episodes, including the DNA analyzer from USS Callister, the parental control pad from Archangel be bloody bathtub from crocodile, and even the strange symbol mark ski masks from White Bear. These are more than just Easter eggs. There are visual clues to the viewer that Black Museum is a Meta textual reflection of the show itself. The artifacts that contain serve as a physical representation of the episodes they appeared in, and even the name black museum is deliberately evocative of the show's title Black Mirror like the holiday special white Christmas black museum is an anthology within an anthology with three separate subplots loosely connected by Rolo Haynes is narration and utilizing this same methodology structure.

Speaker 1:          01:58          Black Museum is mirroring the format of black mirror, but if the exhibits in the background represent past episodes, what do the three new gadgets, Dr Dawson's lymphatic diagnoser, the monkey stuff with Carrie's consciousness and Clayton Lee's holographic holding cell represent each item is an interface for human consciousness, a more direct means of what television and social media already do today. These fictional items represent the different ways our current technology both connects and disconnects us as a society. Dustin's implant connects him and his patients signaling their sensations to him via the hairnet. Looking headgear. The upload which inserts carries mind into the backseat of Jack's brain, allows her to see and feel as he does and the thin string separating Clayton's consciousness from the museum. Visitors creates emotional distance akin to the distance between fictionalized characters and desensitize audiences. Dawson subplot comments on media's ability to let us empathize with characters and experience thrills without any physical ramifications.

Speaker 1:          03:01          Imagine if you could feel exactly what a patient feels minus the physical consequences. Jack and Carrie story reflects media's ability to turn us into voyeurs. Clayton story reflects on the guilt free gratification we get from consuming violence in media. In all of these cases, technology allows individuals to experience things vicariously like hitchhiker, like a passenger, vicarious sensations. She sees what you see, she feels what you feel. This episode dramatizes what all fiction generally does and what Black Mirror as a television program does. Specifically all fiction is delivered to us via a medium in the case of black mirror through television. Television itself is enroll those words, a receiver for human experiences and one that often, as Rolo says, offers no privacy for him, no agency for her with a particularly compelling show like Black Mirror. We become increasingly invested and share in the same sense of joy in San Junipero as Kelly and Yorkie the same indignation as being in 15 million merits and the same initial prejudices and gradual awakening as stripe in men against fire.

Speaker 1:          04:15          For philosopher Martha Nussbaum. This kind of connection is emblematic of narratives, roles in one's moral development. Narratives according to Nussbaum free us from the parochial confines over our own lives and place us in a position both like and unlike our own like in that we are emotionally involved with the characters, active with them and aware of our incompleteness, unlike in that we're free of certain sources of distortion that frequently impede our real life deliberations. For example, take a character like being in 15 million merits. His love for abby might remind us of our own lives, but unlike being we're not sent on a downward spiral when that love is lost, yet we can still experience it from a distance. Black Museum, however, explores the danger of this distancing effect through Dr Dawson subplot and it's here that the episode looks at the potentially desensitizing nature of the series owned violent imagery,

Speaker 2:          05:09          more pain. He felt pleasure, God

Speaker 1:          05:12          in a series which premiered with the prime minister of Britain. A pig. Maintaining that same sense of shock requires increasingly more shocking scenes. Bus, they need to surprise audiences in shut up and dance. By revealing that the protagonist they'd been rooting for had been into Kiddie porn,

Speaker 2:          05:35          only to

Speaker 1:          05:35          be topped in the subsequent season in crocodile. As we experienced an average human being transitioned from innocence to infanticide because a baby per rolo. As the show progressed, our relationship with pain had shifted. We're not merely desensitized to the violence on screen. We take a twisted kind of pleasure in the discomfort it inflicts upon us. See, it's like eating chilis, your climate eyes fast. First Time we had a Jalapeno that you spat it out too hot, persevere, and it becomes addictive, but black museum is ultimately not apologetic for engaging in such extreme emotions, arguing through its third subplot that the show is not empty. Sensationalism, but rather has a purpose motivating it in the main exhibit of Black Museum. We see what remains of Clayton Lee, the alleged murderer who is arrested. Execution had been alluded to throughout the episode like carrying the Monkey. His consciousness continues on even after the exploration of his physical body. I'll be at this time as a self aware hologram. As the museum's grand attraction visitors are invited to pull the switch themselves, not merely inflicting real torture on this Lee, but in the process creating a sentience souvenir that eternally experiences the moment of execution. It was beautiful juicing him out.

Speaker 3:          06:55          Subconscious session, snapshot of Clayton, not a recording, a true copy of his mind perpetually experiencing that, but stuck

Speaker 1:          07:04          forever in that one. Perfect. Similar to white Christmas in which the cookie of Joe is confined to a virtual cabin for what he experiences as hundreds of thousands of years. It's the punishment made perpetual that most offenders, our innate sense of proportionality, even if he committed the crime, no finite offense could merit infinite punishment. As such, the show forces us to empathize with one character who may be a murderer and another absolutely guilty of manslaughter and a child on Christmas. We don't merely feel bad for them from the safe distance of our side of the screen. We feel their pain with them. Likewise, we feel a sense of vindication when our audience surrogate niche revealed to be Clayton's daughter and carrying her mother inside her head, enact retribution against Rolo. It's not just that niche seeing the suffering of her father or hearing the story of Kerry engender empathy in her.

Speaker 1:          07:58          It's that such empathy then motivated her to moral action. This is black museum state went about how Black Mirror sees itself and its purpose. It's not desensitizing spectacle and empty entertainment. It's not even a cautionary tale about the dangers of technology after all, the same mind sharing method which caused Jack so much. Grief is shown as being beneficial to niche and her mother rather black mirror sees itself as serving the same role as a long line of literature and science fiction shows which connect us emotionally to their characters in order to engender empathy and in turn, encourage us to enact justice in the episode arc. Angel Art empathetic attachment to the constantly surveilled. Sarah is supposed to incite us against similar big mother surveillance systems pervading our lives or in the episode metal head. Our investment in Bella survival against what is essentially Boston dynamics is big dog invites us to scrutinize the militarization of autonomous machines in all these cases, black communities able to raise our concerns for these societal issues as effectively as it does only because it first causes us to care for the characters it's crafted.

Speaker 1:          09:06          Black Museum is the whole of the show. Black Mirror distilled down to a single episode preserving the same content, the same format, and most importantly the same purpose to see ourselves reflected in the black mirror that is our television screen or smartphone. Engaging empathetically with the characters were connected to buy that screen and by doing so, expanding our moral imagination and motivating us towards justice. Thanks for watching guys.
