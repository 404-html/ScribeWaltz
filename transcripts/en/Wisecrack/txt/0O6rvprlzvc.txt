Speaker 1:          00:07          Hey, wise crack jared here. And today we're talking about one of the funniest and weirdest shows on television Atlanta. What makes Atlanta so thought provoking is that it's simultaneously one of the most realistic and one of the most surreal shows on television. It's this seemingly contradictory combination that makes the show one of the most interesting and hilarious shows on the air. So welcome to this wise crack edition on the philosophy of Atlanta spoilers ahead. And a lucky if you're watching this one's for you buddy. But first a quick breakdown for the uninitiated. Atlanta has a simple premise earn a princeton dropout, needs to find a way to make some money. So it links up with this cousin Alfred Aka Paper Boi and becomes his manager. All the while he tries to balance his relationship with the mother of his daughter Van and becomes friends with Alfred's roommate darious.

Speaker 1:          00:53          But this simple premise is deceiving as the show which Creator Donald Glover described as twin peaks with rappers, pushes the boundaries of reality to insane links for both comedic and dramatic effect. And it accomplishes this by using both surrealism and realism. Let's begin by defining our terms. Realism is any set of restrictions to a creative work which demand that it adhere to the dominant assumptions about what is and isn't possible. Realism presents the world with minimal interference from the perspective of the artist. One of the best examples of contemporary realism is the work of British filmmaker Ken Loach. We'll use this as films to presents the gritty reality of British life without any sugarcoating his most recent film, I, Daniel Blake tells the story of a man struggling to stay financially afloat in the brutal bureaucracy of the British welfare state, and unlike the typical Hollywood tale of overcoming poverty, Daniel Blake dies alone in a bathroom stall before receiving justice. Unlike this harsh realism, surrealism pushes beyond the limits of reality. If Ken loach uses the camera to show the world precisely as it is someone like David Lynch uses it to create something which exceeds our logical expectation.

Speaker 1:          02:09          Now, it's also worth noting that most comedic television is neither realistic nor surrealist, but simply fiction with no real claim to authenticity. This is why it doesn't matter that the Manhattan of Seinfeld is just a soundstage in Los Angeles or that Kevin James could be married to three different beautiful women into different CBS shows. Now that we're clear on the basics, let's get into the nitty gritty of surrealism with the Oji surrealists Andre Norton, who is to surrealism. What guy theory is to donkey sauce and percent. Robert Barton was a French writer working in the early 20th century who viewed surrealism as both an artistic and political tool. One of the ways in which Proton described surrealism is a psychic automatism and its bigger state by week one proposal to express the actual functioning of thought. Have you haven't had your daily microdose of Lsd yet? Put Burton is saying is that surrealism uses art to express what's really going on at both the personal and social level.

Speaker 1:          03:04          Surrealist art might confuse us at first, but on the other side of this confusion, we can see the world in a new light. So how do you take an art form that aspires to exceed reality and combine it with an art form that takes the exact opposite approach. While let's find out first on realism. Atlanta makes a deliberate effort to portray life in Atlanta accurately, especially for people struggling like earth. It removes the fictionalized glamour of say a rap video and instead gives us the sometimes not so pleasant reality behind the facade. Take paper voice apartment while the network originally wanted him to live somewhere that would fit the stereotype of a rapper's house. The show puts him in a pretty standard Atlanta apartment building or someone like paper boy would actually live or redmond

Speaker 2:          03:47          got my eye and then boys right here, you know we are in on the floor or watch tv at the same time,

Speaker 1:          03:56          he also is usually profusely sweating because Atlanta is king hot and anyone who had portrayed otherwise with makeup is a liar. Meanwhile, earn lives in a storage unit and works a series of odd jobs while trying to make it as a manager when they're in need of sustenance. Paper Boi and dairy is don't just get wings from an anonymous restaurant. They go to Atlanta institution Jr crickets and ordered lemon pepper, wet wigs, a regional staple not available outside the six seven eight and 404 area codes major

Speaker 2:          04:21          and then couple of joints. These cocktail sauce on snap lemon pepper wings.

Speaker 1:          04:28          This commitment to realism makes the city of Atlanta a character in the show. This stands in stark contrast to surrealism. While it's realism is important, Atlanta's embrace of surrealism has produced its most memorable moments, whether it's been the Tele Sandwich guy on the bus

Speaker 3:          04:45          symptom, not the way things necessarily the ship

Speaker 1:          04:59          black student wearing white facing class, a strip club Dj speaking to earn.

Speaker 2:          05:04          You'll just look at it Tipa what are you going my man, I said Chip Hook with that green jacket out. Whack ass cold. Cool g shirt

Speaker 1:          05:17          or most things. Darious does the careful. It's very, very cold. Atlanta's world is full of seemingly nonsensical characters and events. Atlanta often blends the surreal and the real together in the same scene, including the one we just discussed after being told that the chef hooked him up. We see a magical glow coming from the wings showing the viewers from outside Atlanta precisely how magical and revered these wings are. But often the use of surrealism can ask us to rethink what we take for granted. And the season one episode, nobody beats the biebs paper. Boys playing a celebrity basketball game with the son of Justin Timberlake and Post Malone Justin Bieber. Well, the idea of paper Boi dunking on Bieber is perfect enough on its own. The real twist comes when we see Justin Bieber and he's well black. The deal, this is a clear subversion of our expectation and while this surreal, this casting might seem confusing, it creates some wonderful comedic moments. Get a Buddha, others because Brian's out. Cool. But what's most important is that besides being black, Atlanta, Justin bieber acts just like the real justin bieber. He treats reporters and fans like acts like a spoiled Brat has a huge entourage and can't fathom the idea of anyone getting more attention than him. After acting like an asshole for much of the episode, beaver holds a press conference where he apologizes for his behavior with the new song

Speaker 1:          06:53          thing that bieber actually did in real life.

Speaker 2:          06:56          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          07:06          This surreal take on beavers very real behavior leaves the audience with a crucial question, namely what his behavior be perceived differently. If he were black, black beaver would please Burton as he's used, not just for surreal humor. The forces, the audience to rethink their assumptions about reality. In this case, does our culture forgive white celebrities for bad behavior of while holding celebrities of color to a different standard and even weirder example of surrealism takes place in the same episode while paper Boi and earn are busy at the celebrity basketball game, darious heads is local gun range to let off some stress, but his range mates get pissed when they noticed. Dairies says target poster isn't a human outline, but instead a picture of a dog, this raises the question, who would shoot a dog target shoot dogs. We're not your second. But then we're forced to consider, well, why would I shoot a human?

Speaker 1:          07:58          I mean that's weird, right? I mean, look at that one. This is way too specific. It's also a potential nod to white people's over the top obsession with their dogs, which nobody a wise crack from late to, nope, not, not even a little bit. I did not know people like dogs this month. I use of realism that is quite literally hard to see. Takes place in episode eight of season one in which earned darious and paper boy are outside the club after strong arming the club owner to get paid. Just getting their money was a surreal endeavor in itself, but things get even weirder once they hit the parking lot. In case you don't know what you just saw that was an invisible car speeding through the parking lot, leaving bodies in its weight. Is this meant to be a commentary on the absurd ways that celebrities use their money to flex on everyone else?

Speaker 1:          08:40          Maybe could it be highlighting the way in which we have become so desensitized to violence that the only way to make it stand out is to use an invisible car possibly. Or is this Atlanta at its most twin peaks, and we shouldn't look for meaning at all either way. It's a good reminder that surrealism doesn't always have to mean something as often. It's used to undermine and confuse our rational impulse to project meaning onto everything. Nice condo. The flip side of this, meaningless surrealism can be seen in one of the most uncomfortable moments of season one, the juneteenth party, in case you're not up on your history. Juneteenth is the holiday that celebrates the abolition of slavery in Texas and in general, the emancipation of slaves throughout the confederacy at the party, the husband of the host gives earn an impromptu lecture on the importance of visiting Africa.

Speaker 2:          09:24          That was a pilgrimage needed to pay my respects. Ask for forgiveness. One, you know, right? I don't, I really don't like you. You've never been to Africa. No. You gotta go. It's your motherland. What are you thinking

Speaker 1:          09:44          and predicts his ancestors via his facial features,

Speaker 2:          09:47          Congo, Ivory Coast, southeastern, ben to region. I don't know this spooky thing called slavery happened and my entire ethnic identity was her race.

Speaker 1:          09:58          And to ensure that he is the platonic form of that white guy. He let it performs a poem about the horrors of slavery. Jim Crow has the name of a man, but is it

Speaker 2:          10:10          ghost? I am a man,

Speaker 1:          10:13          but Jim Crow is haunting me liking that movie poltergeist. That's right. The only white guy at the party celebrating the end of slavery performs a poem about slavery from the perspective of a black man,

Speaker 2:          10:29          let me slave ships

Speaker 1:          10:31          and to add salt to the rim of this Super Awkward Margarita. The parties bar offers fun cocktails named after the horrors of slavery.

Speaker 2:          10:39          I have to plantation master poison

Speaker 1:          10:42          and we couldn't talk about surrealism and Atlanta without covering the most. Talked about episodes of season one b a n the entire episode takes place during a fictional talk show where paper boys being grilled by a feminist sociologist for his lyric

Speaker 4:          10:55          rap is tickets coming home to roost. My life is messed up. Y'All did? Okay. That's black news. You can look that up. Well your news is problematic. This, that ain't my fault.

Speaker 1:          11:04          The crown jewel of this episode is a black teenager from Atlanta. That self identifies as a 30 year old white man from Denver.

Speaker 2:          11:11          Hey, excuse me. What Ipa? Do you have one tack? Hey, did you see game of thrones last night?

Speaker 1:          11:17          This came on the heels of the cultural show. That was Rachel Dolezal and the ensuing debates about trans racial identity while the notion of a white person self identifying as black led to genuine debate and consideration. Atlanta asks us to consider how we feel about the issue when it's a black teen self identifying as a white man and paper voice responses. One that much of the audience likely resonates with.

Speaker 4:          11:39          I'm sorry. Yeah. This is dumb. This is dumb

Speaker 1:          11:43          and this might be the ultimate genius of Atlanta as unlike other shows that have used surreal elements to take us further away from reality. Atlanta uses surrealism to bring our back to reality by using the surreal to disrupt the habitual way we look at and think about certain topics we can reconsider them altogether. We see this in Clark County and his hybrid music video slash commercial for you who uh, blacks on the base. Like this seemingly surreal example of a famous rapper making a song about an artificial chocolate beverage exposes something that's an actually going on. I Eve, much of art produced in our day and age is really just thinly veiled advertising. We don't really need

Speaker 4:          12:31          good.

Speaker 1:          12:31          This example resonates with the influence of Marxism one Burton as he surreal moment leads to a sociopolitical critique. This use of surrealism for social critique is what keeps Atlanta in the spirit of protons work in both seasons. Surrealism is used to reflect on everything from inequality to cultural appropriation.

Speaker 2:          12:56          Boy, they before Christie grab go

Speaker 1:          13:02          and it refuses to let the viewer turn off their TV without confronting something real and urgent about society. This might be the most unique contribution Atlanta has made to contemporary television in the same way that an employee's surrealism without veering into absurdity. It also provides cultural commentary without coming off as preachy.

Speaker 2:          13:21          Hi, I'm Brandon Tartikoff, chairman of NBC entertainment and I've got a hit idea for the new fall season. Don't do drugs. There's no hope when dope

Speaker 1:          13:33          and it's this commitment to pushing the boundaries of surrealism that gives us one of the most insane moments of television in recent memory.

Speaker 2:          13:42          Gotcha. Okay.

Speaker 1:          13:54          Before we go, it's worth mentioning the aims of Bhutan, surrealism in relation to Atlanta, creator Donald Glover's, musical alter ego, childish Gambino as Britain makes clear the aim of surrealism is not simply to create a new form of culture, it's to use art to change culture can revealing its true structure. The baton, the world is only very relatively into with thought meaning that much of what we perceive isn't a true indicator of the way the world really is. We can see this in this is America. We're surreal elements are used to make a scaling political critique of the State of affairs in Contemporary America and if this video is any indication it seems like glover and his creative circle, we'll be continuing to push the limits of a new black surrealism for the foreseeable future and as always, thanks for watching guys.
