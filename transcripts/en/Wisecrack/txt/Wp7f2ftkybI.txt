Speaker 1:          00:04          Hey guys, so pilot season continues here at wise crack, so this one is special to us for a couple of reasons. First of all, this is the first time we're going to be talking about real world events rather than focusing on media. Secondly, we're bringing the vision of one of my favorite artists to life is the girl went to college with, her name is Tyler Rice and we're super excited to have her aesthetic be part of the wise crack family, but also I wanted to introduce the voice of this pilot, Jacob, who is my co founder who created wisecrack with me about four years ago. Hey guys, we're really pumped to get this out to you guys, so let us know what you think in the comments and make sure you let Larry know to see you guys later. Enjoy the show.

Speaker 2:          00:45          Have you seen the news lately? It sucks. Today's media landscape gives people more ways than ever to hear only the things they want to hear. When confronted with ideas that challenged their beliefs, many react with outrage, censorship and recently cries of fake news. This trend may seem to have popped out of nowhere, but this was actually predicted a long time ago in a book you've probably read Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 400.

Speaker 3:          01:11          Do you want in case you slept through middle school English. The book depicts a dark future, or firemen have graduated from saving cats. The torching books in an attempt to silence any troubling ideas Fahrenheit is usually interpreted as an attack on government censorship, especially since Brad re wrote the book in the midst of Mccarthy's war on communism, but there's actually someone else Bradbury blames for the dystopia his characters live in you.

Speaker 2:          01:38          Well not only you, but all of us. See in the book the main characters informed that it was the public that censored themselves. It all started with the advent of mass media technology advanced to such a degree that people struggled to keep up information, rushed in from every direction, overwhelming the population to quell their anxiety. People focused on smaller pieces of information. Beatty, captain of the firefighters describes this change, how media has been reduced from cumbersome novels to the gag. The snap ending one column, two sentences, a headline than midair all vanishes just like that we consume and forget and consume. Again, rinse, wash, repeat the mind drinks less and less

Speaker 3:          02:24          soon. People became addicts, conditioned to feel pleasure from frivolous content. Anything thought provoking became downright painful. As a result, people censored themselves from any challenging ideas they sought to be pacified, numbed and validated soundbites, factoids, and vapid drama, blurring out any troubling ideas blaring out reality.

Speaker 2:          02:46          We see similar patterns with the rise of social networking and the feed news story after new story that generates as you scroll video after video, meme after meme, directly fed and programs to your liking just as long as you continue scrolling in Fahrenheit, the media concluded that it could attract the biggest audience by routing itself, if anything controversial, effectively ceding control of its content to outrage our media. Saturated society is an extension of Bradbury's vision with so many different channels, streaming services and websites, media has fragmented each appealing to their own individual audiences. Fox News for conservatives, MSNBC for liberals and Youtube for flat earthers get each of these media outlets must pander to their audience, which is why Fox News can't piss off mainstream republicans, evangelicals and NRA members and Msnbc can't piss off mainstream Democrats, progressives, and gun control advocates.

Speaker 3:          03:45          The result is isolated bubbles that become harder and harder to burst. It's like beatty said, offended as few as possible. The truth is secondary to comfort, and once someone finds their bubble, don't label anything that challenges their ideas

Speaker 2:          04:00          as fake news, both in the book and in real life. People protect themselves from anything that confounds or upsets. They just want to continue watching and scrolling and watching and scrolling, watching, scrolling. So what happens next in Fahrenheit? It's here that the government steps in encouraging everyone to stay in the bubble and torch any stragglers. Sometimes literally, are we destined for a similar fate or will the champions of free thought save assault?
