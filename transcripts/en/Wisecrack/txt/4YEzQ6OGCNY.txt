Speaker 1:          00:16          Greetings and welcome to earthlink cinema. I am your host Garrick's wormy Lloyd. This week's artifact is the exorcist starring the lady who was in like 10 minutes of requiem for a dream, and the guy who was in like 10 seconds of Star Wars, episode seven, the force wakes up. The film follows female human Chris who has a male name and her female daughter, Reagan who has a Republican name. Chris is an actress even though that has basically nothing to do with the plot of the movie. Her daughter Reagan plays a game of spooky monopoly, which I guess is the inciting incident, but the film isn't exactly clear on that. She starts acting like a millennial, being irritable, anything saying swear words and pissing all over everything. She sees Chris Shuttles in thousands of doctors to test Reagan, which she can afford because she's a famous actress, but the doctors can't find anything physically wrong with her other than her inability to transverse beyond the third dimension and affliction that was common in the Milky Way Galaxy before we developed a vaccine one night. Reagan takes it too far when she does the whole don't tell mom the babysitter's dead routine.

Speaker 2:          01:21          Deceased was killed and then pushed your daughter's window.

Speaker 1:          01:25          So Chris decides it's time to give up on modern medicine and start having a little fun with it. She goes on a romantic stroll with father charisse across dressing mystic to see if he can do that thing from the title. Forget about exorcism. He isn't sure if Reagan is really possessed by a demon, so he asks her and she says, after that all he has to do is procrastinate for a little while longer and then like a crunchwrap supreme, he's good to go. Unfortunately, the bureaucrats at corporate determined Charisse is too much of a sexy hothead to perform the ceremony by himself, so they fly in a ringer named Marin and bump caris down to first alternate. The two priests start vigorously exercising Reagan, who luckily has been content to just sit in her bedroom the whole time instead of making any attempt to leave or cause havoc or do anything at all. Demon Reagan responds by giving a gentle razzing, which causes him to get the vapor so marin kicks him out so he can go it alone, maverick style, but the real maverick thing to do is die immediately, which brings charisse back to times square one all out of ideas. He asks the demon to possess him instead

Speaker 2:          02:37          it and

Speaker 1:          02:39          the demon is so damn agreeable. It just does it with no hesitation. Then charisse jumps out the window to his death. Seems like it could just float away and find someone else. I don't really know how demons work. The exorcist is a contemplation on religions place. In the 20th century of Earth's existence. The film was released during a time when religious obedience on the decline and the 19 seventies sexual revolution was on an incline since that provides more torque and the opening of the film, we meet Father Marin, uncovering doodads on an ancient burial site signifying that spiritual beliefs have been buried in favor of modern fidget spinners. Chris and Reagan are products of their time ignoring religion, even though it circles around them like an annoyingly persistent Hulu.

Speaker 3:          03:23          Do you have any religious beliefs? No. What about your daughter know why

Speaker 1:          03:28          Chris Casually takes the Lord Son's name in vain, daughter on her birthday for Christ and besides football. Obviously the only significance of Sunday is that she doesn't have to work on a Sunday this year. Thus when Reagan's problem start to manifest, everybody looks to secular explanations such as her absentee father. You mentioned her father and separation and scientific causes like cte. The film explores the area between science and religion, also known as homeroom father Charisse, who's religious training was overlaid by years of med school in Boston, well near Boston, initially considered the idea of exorcism to be antiquated.

Speaker 3:          04:14          It just doesn't happen anymore on this. Since when? Since we learned about mental illness, paranoia, schizophrenia, all those things they taught me at Harvard.

Speaker 1:          04:24          His experience with his mother's dementia predisposes him towards psychiatric explanations for Reagan's Tomfoolery only water. Furthermore, the demon pretends to be hurt by tap water, tap water, which reinforces charisse has doubts about the demonic properties of fluoride. In contrast to Caris, the developed Father Marin acts with the conviction that are racist, grandpa set in his ways. When Kara starts to explain Reagan's case, Marin stops him because of his extensive experience with highlander.

Speaker 3:          04:53          I think it might be helpful if I gave you some background on the different personalities were begun as a benefit so far, I'd say that seem to be three. She's convinced that

Speaker 1:          05:02          Harris ultimately accepts the true nature of Reagan's possession. The message being that religion maintains its relevance in the modern world since both religion and the modern world are equally absurd. Through Keris is journey. The film explores the reason for evils existence and area of study called theodicy. The film specifically espouses the Iranian model not to be confused with the Iranian model or the training model. St Aaron has believed that to achieve moral perfection, a human must suffer evil and possess the freewill to choose goodness instead, even though it's boring. Under this explanation, Reagan's possession doesn't indicate the absence of God, but rather serves as a test of faith to those around her, especially that babysitter she killed Father Charisse is alienated from God because of his mother's condition and as burdens as a psychiatrist and the demon attacks these pressure points like a Swedish massage. Zeus in the end, Charisse confronts his evil head on by performing a Christ like sacrifice, thus demonstrating is reunification with God. Similarly, when Reagan kisses a preceptor, she is cured. The film suggests that the ordeal may bring her to faith as well. It also suggests she is in for a lifetime of barking up the wrong dick. Earthling cinema. I'm Garrick's formula. The power of space compels you.
