Speaker 1:          00:04          Hey wisecracks and share it again. You might've noticed that we have a soft spot for cynical, irreverent, and even nihilist comedy, but we've recently been wondering is there anything on the other side of our current cynicism is comedy based and earnestness and genuine human emotion still possible? To answer this question, we're turning to our friend Bo Burnham, a comedian who might have cracked the code for how to embrace all the intellectual goodness of postmodern irony

Speaker 2:          00:36          while

Speaker 1:          00:36          offering something with a real human core. Could we get the house lights up for a second and could you put the lights on stage? Let the artifice fade away. Now we're all the same like a candy bar that has a hard shell of cultural cynicism on the outside, but a warm hug from your favorite aunt on the inside. Even though Burnham is still baby faced, his work has actually gone through a few distinct stages. While his earliest work incorporates postmodern cynicism and ironic detachment, I adopted a child from overseas to rescue him from child labor factories and on his very first birthday we went to build a bear workshop is more recent work. Not only exposes the meaningless core of contemporary life, but also attempts to offer a corrective with introspection and a search for happiness. On a scale from one to zero are you happy?

Speaker 1:          01:27          Burnham might be the rare comedic figure able to offer salvation from the empty cultural wasteland. That is our modern world. So welcome to this wisecrack condition on the philosophy of Bo Burnham and I guess spoilers part one. How did we get here to understand why Burnham represents such an important shift in comedy? We first need to see how comedy arrived at its postmodern era, and more importantly, what the hell is even meant by postmodernism. This phrase become so amorphous that it can be used to describe everything from cars to Scottish beer, but a more helpful understanding can be found in the work of Fredrick Jamison who's work describes postmodernism as the cultural logic of late capitalism, which means that each new form of economic life creates a related form of cultural life. For example, when you're a poor college student, your economic situation dictates a cultural life of cheap beers.

Speaker 1:          02:19          Movies in a dorm room and paying for dollar cheesy rollups with your laundry quarters. When you graduate and get a job, you're drinking a locally made IPA paying $20 for a movie ticket and using your debit card for a cheesy Gordita crunch. A few years later, you sell your app flush finder that gives you a map of the cleanest public toilets near you and you'll be drinking aged whiskey sitting court side and sending your scared assistant, Adrian, to grab you a crunchwrap Supreme Combo. Each economic stage in your life leads to a new cultural stage and postmodernism is the cultural logic of the current stage of economic development, which jamison calls late capitalism. Now let's see how Jamison's ideas can help us understand me shifting trends in American comedy over the past 70 years. We can do this with a three step process. Economic Culture leads to popular culture, which leads to comedy. Let's start in the fifties America is in a post war boom. The Gi bill has led to record numbers of college grads and homeowners. It's easy to get a middle class job and Cuba is just a quaint island of resorts and cocktails. This era's popular culture is all about optimism and enjoyment.

Speaker 2:          03:26          What are you doing up here? I thought you were downstairs. Backs and chocolate all. They kicked me out of there fast. I kept pinching them to see what kind they were

Speaker 1:          03:34          and their comedy sensibility can be seen in someone like Jack Benny.

Speaker 2:          03:38          Congratulation bars, why you would just shine when appeal of a day data

Speaker 1:          03:42          by the mid sixties the boom time is over. The Cold War has people on edge and the Vietnam war is on the horizon. There were protests, naked hippies and someone gave the Beatles. LSD. The counterculture had snuck into the popular culture and Lenny Bruce is on trial for obscenities while George Carlin is listing

Speaker 2:          04:02          and

Speaker 1:          04:03          by the 80s Reagan had promised endless economic growth and we've got cable TV to keep us company. 24 seven new media creates the opportunity for a new read of superstar and wild. Michael Jackson sold out arenas with his music. Eddie Murphy did the same with comedy, but let's be honest, the most important thing is how fly they look and red leather jacket.

Speaker 3:          04:21          It's in the nineties Comedians like Jerry Seinfeld and Ray Romano had gone from successful standups to television stars. How many was more mainstream than ever? MTV giant cell phones and economic growth, a bounded and all the while. How many rode this wave with a new optimism and increasingly goofy spirit.

Speaker 2:          04:39          We're not worthy,

Speaker 1:          04:43          but just like Taco bell's Nacho fries, good things can't last forever. And by the dawn of the 21st century, the.com bubble had burst. Limp Biscuit was popular and nine 11 left the country. Wondering if anything could be funny anymore.

Speaker 2:          04:57          Can we be funny? Why start now?

Speaker 1:          05:03          As the aughts rolled on, things didn't get much better. The 2008 financial crisis was the worst since the great depression and the weird scrubs reboot left us all wondering if nothing was sacred anymore. Part too

Speaker 3:          05:15          comedy as cultural cynicism, the political and economic cynicism of the oughts led to a new form of cultural cynicism in the media

Speaker 2:          05:24          design. And I never was alone. If you don't go squeeze on her day.

Speaker 3:          05:30          Wow. Mostly known for its groundbreaking character prison. Mike.

Speaker 2:          05:33          The worst thing about prison was the was the dementors. They were flying all over the place and it was scary and then they'd come down and they suck the soul out of your body and it height.

Speaker 3:          05:42          The office showed us the mundane and often meaningless existence of the American worker and the rest of his division was slowly taken over by reality shows that we're all completely fake, but nobody seemed to care. One of the most recent shifts that helps us. The effect of late capitalism on comedy is what we're calling the adult swim phenomenon. What started as a way for cartoon network to get stoners to watch their channel while eating double decker tacos has since become the home of some of the weirdest, most absurd and most intentionally cringeworthy comedy to hit the American Airways. Tim and Eric, awesome show, great job, showed us a surreal and absurdist version of the upside down. [inaudible]. It's nice to put a good Eric Andre ironically occupied the space of the late night host, the show how meaningless the late night model had become while using interviews with c list celebrities. The highlight, the vapid nature of it, contemporary fame. Mr Neighbors House has recently shown us what happens when Mr. Rogers has put through the postmodern cynicism filter.

Speaker 2:          06:44          Uh, no matter what the color and when you lie, you hurt your brother.

Speaker 3:          06:50          And of course our friends rick and morty give us an animated response to the classic philosophical question. What if back to the future was an r rated movie involving the multiverse nihilism. Nobody gets it. Nothing you think matters, matters and lots of brown liquor. Many of these shows weren't even funny, at least in the traditional sense, whereas the 90s and early aughts used canned laughter to tell our lizard brains when to laugh.

Speaker 4:          07:13          Ah,

Speaker 3:          07:14          Eric Andre used canned laughter to create an uncomfortable moment for all involved

Speaker 2:          07:20          to hear about this.

Speaker 3:          07:23          Maybe Andre just wants to push the limits of what we'll watch or maybe he's asking you if there's even such a thing as authentic comedy anymore. We only know one thing's for sure about.

Speaker 2:          07:34          You've got to eat. The lettuce is just straight up eat the lettuce

Speaker 3:          07:39          at the same time that adult swim is blossoming. Occupy Wall Street is taking over the streets of Manhattan and young people around the world are questioning economic and political institutions in a way that would make the mug covered. Hippies proud, but I'm like their forefathers Linnaean and George who used political cynicism to infuse their comedy with an urgency for truth.

Speaker 2:          07:59          Got No steel industry left, can educate our young people, can't get healthcare to our old people, but we can bomb the shit out of your country.

Speaker 4:          08:05          Three. All right.

Speaker 3:          08:07          Don't swim generation. Let this cynicism go from a rallying cry. This cynicism for cynicism safe rather than a response to a troubled world. This cynicism denied the existence of real meaning or truth in the first place.

Speaker 2:          08:20          Just say summit again, it don't matter, but not of this. Madison

Speaker 3:          08:24          do return to the fourth meal of cultural theory. Fredrick Jamison. This cynical comedy is a perfect exemplification of postmodernism, the same cultural form repeats, but this time with iron ore to paraphrase marks first as Johnny Carson, ben is Eric Andre eating his own vomit. Cynicism and irony led to a brand of comedy in which truth meaning and human earnestness are just useless relics from the era of canned laughter and Pesky New York mothers. So are we now in this postmodern feedback loop of meaninglessness? Maybe not. But to find out we have to return to our friend Beau. Nope. The other one, she's pretty, but no, no. Not The obamas. Portuguese water dog. The comedian, lanky white guy in his twenties yes. Finally Jesus.

Speaker 1:          09:15          Three from irony to sincerity in Bo Burnham, our guys. Before we keep going, real charity here for a minute. As you guys know, we sometimes talk about pretty heavy subjects. Cynicism. Nihilism avoids a meaning. You know the drill. But these topics can be, to put it bluntly, a bumper. So that's why I want to talk about this video sponsored for better help, a counseling service that allows you to connect with licensed therapists on your computer, tablet, or mobile phone. I actually tried the service myself, so wait till the end of the video to hear more about my experience until then, go to better help.com/wise crack to get started. And now back to Bo. Bo Burnham is an interesting case. As much of his early work was shaped by the influence of Dutch absurdist haunts, tailwind,

Speaker 5:          09:56          where have you been in jail? For what? Right? I had no idea

Speaker 1:          10:05          and embodied eighth attach irony which exemplified the tenants of postmodern comedy.

Speaker 6:          10:09          Jesus can walk on water. Can you swim on land

Speaker 1:          10:14          because there is no fixed standard of truth or meaning. Burnham used comedy to point the audience to the slack. Jesus

Speaker 6:          10:21          wasn't the Messiah. Get back on the herons again. I'm on fire with the head of past those holy nights stuff. Holy mother, right

Speaker 1:          10:28          in his recent work, Burnham pushes back against the emptiness of postmodernism in an attempt to find genuine meaning in things like love and happiness. We could say that rather than returning back to ava. Modern perspective, Burnham pushes through postmodernism to arrive at a post postmodern perspective where the death of traditional meaning is an opportunity for the creation of new meanings. We can see his progression by considering his three specials as three distinct stages in his comedic development is first special words, words, words explores the death of art and comedy. The followup, what goes a step further and operates under the principle that meaning itself is dead and his most recent special make happy works through the death of meaning in an attempt to see if real meaning and happiness are still possible from the opening minutes of words, words, words, Burnham aims to show the audience the facade of entertainment.

Speaker 6:          11:20          It's all an illusion and I'm wearing may God I'm wearing may got bay Guy Burnham

Speaker 1:          11:26          art is dead because it's really just a means for something else. So people think you're funny how they get those people's mind and true to the logic of late capitalism. The real purpose of art is simply creating opportunities for making more money and presumably eating Nacho cheese, Doritos, locos, supreme's whenever you want and when he speculates on what the forefathers of counter cultural comedy would think. His conclusion isn't pretty.

Speaker 6:          11:48          We're rolling in dough out car. Lana rose eight is gray. His array by pointing

Speaker 1:          11:54          to the death of art, Burnham shows how comedy has just become a way for charming narcissist, make as much money as they can with no imperative for authenticity or truth. If words, words, words is Burnham's eulogy for the death of art. He goes a step further in what and mourns the death of truth and meaning as such, artist alive, not like Israel. And he's aware that in the context of people's actual problems, laughter isn't the medicine we've been sold.

Speaker 6:          12:20          That's it last towards the key to everything is the way to solve all the sadness in the world. I mean, not for the people that are actually stabbed, but the people like us that got to deal with them all the time.

Speaker 1:          12:29          Unlike the adult swim comedians burden doesn't just embrace the chaos that comes from the depth of meaning. He's asking what it means for us when meaning dies.

Speaker 6:          12:38          None of you are go, hey,

Speaker 1:          12:42          and asking whether or not the creation of meaning is possible.

Speaker 6:          12:45          Maybe the life on earth could be have.

Speaker 1:          12:50          He has no conclusive answer in what, and he lets us sit in that space of not knowing.

Speaker 4:          12:55          Oh cool.

Speaker 1:          13:04          What is the point where he starts to consider that comedy devoid of the aspirations of any higher meeting is just an equine atm.

Speaker 6:          13:11          By the way, I'll stop beating this dead horse when it stops spinning. Now

Speaker 1:          13:17          make happy represents Burnham's attempt to use comedy not just for criticism, but as a vehicle to search for meaning and he makes clear early on at his comedy is not a mode of escapism.

Speaker 7:          13:28          You are here because you want to laugh and you want to forget about your problems, but I cannot allow it. You should not mind. You should not forget about your problems.

Speaker 1:          13:44          Instead of escape, Burnham tries to use comedy as an occasion for the audience. Jukes truly encountered their problems and maybe themselves in the process and less you underestimate Burnham's desire to make you think about some real shit.

Speaker 6:          13:55          Okay.

Speaker 7:          13:55          The world is not funny. 12% of the world's population does not have access to clean drinking water. The world is not funny guy fee area owns two functioning restaurants

Speaker 1:          14:10          and while he has some facts wrong, verdomme doesn't want to use culture as a way to escape reality, which is one of Jamison's worries about postmodernism that it removes the imperative for us to be critical about the world around us. Like a server who lets you know that he's upselling you on donkey sauce, not because it's good but because it will make him money. Burnham lets us peek behind the comedians curtain entertainers, they are lying and they are manipulating you. It's not all harsh reality for Burnham though as he thinks the move past cynicism has some upside. We all deserve even on the days when we are in our past cause we all suck. Love can make a suck less. Paul deserve love. It's the very best part of being an I would know. I just turned 20

Speaker 8:          15:07          yeah.

Speaker 1:          15:09          And by adding that last line, he undercuts his own point, showing us a position that straddles the line between naive optimism and ironic cynicism. The show ends with Bo Burnham's take on a Kanye West concert circuit. 2016 cannot say much

Speaker 9:          15:25          New York cannot see much.

Speaker 1:          15:38          While it might start off with jokes,

Speaker 6:          15:41          listen to the people, I'm sure 90% of the complaint letters you get are about the width of your cans. Just make them wider.

Speaker 1:          15:48          He peppers this confession with some more vulnerable moment.

Speaker 6:          15:50          Don't go to the gym because I'm self conscious about my body, but I'm self conscious about my body cause that don't go to the gym

Speaker 1:          16:00          and he closes out with what seems like a genuine wish for his audience.

Speaker 8:          16:03          Thank you. Good night. I hope you're happy

Speaker 1:          16:07          with make happy. Burnham hearkens back to the socratic tendencies from comedians in a previous era, much like the gadfly of Athens himself, Burnham is urging his audience to truly acknowledge their problems, that unhappiness as the unexamined life is not worth living. And like aristotle, his final words imply that happiness might be possible, but we have to work at it. What's most interesting is that Burnham doesn't simply reject postmodern comedy for the sake of something new. Instead, he pushes postmodern comedy to its limit to see what's on the other side. And over the course of these three specials, we see him transition from irony to cynicism to earnestness or from the death of art to the depth of meaning to the possibility of meaningful art after the death of me. Art For comedy as a cure for despair, or is Rick Sanchez right now, you might be wondering, so what even burden thinks we should try to be happy?

Speaker 1:          16:59          We live in a world where goodness and truth seem increasingly illusory and in a world where Nacho fries aren't even on most Taco bell man use anymore. Is it even worth moving past postmodern cynicism? One telling factor is that Burnham isn't the only one trying to inject a post postmodern sincerity back into comedy. A great example is the most critically successful comedy film of 2017 the big sick, which coincidentally stars Burnham as a comedian obsessed with success and while it's a genuinely funny movie, it explores family success and love with a sincerity, not common in comedy films and it's safe to guests that the inclusion of Ray Romano isn't a coincidence as receive. The cranky set calmed out of the nineties portraying a complicated and compassionate human being. We've also seen this shift from irony to sincerity in shows like Nathan for you. I mean the ones I do get

Speaker 10:         17:50          you guys in a part of me is envious that you know I don't have someone in my life that is unless close with

Speaker 1:          17:58          and infusing absurdity with a story about genuine adult friendship in Detroit and even one of the darkest shows out there. Bojack horseman explores the possibility of finding real meaning. It takes a long time to realize how truly miserable you are and even longer to see that it doesn't have to be that way. Only after you give up everything can you begin to find a way to be happy. While Fredrick Jamison has yet to offer an analysis of the way in which comedy can cure the cultural illness of postmodernism. It might just be the case that Burnham's work is telling us something about what will happen on the other side of late capitalism. Either way, the crunchwrap supreme is here to stay. So maybe there are eternal truths that we can all still believe in. But Hey, crunchwrap supreme is can't solve all your problems. Trust me, I've tried seriously though, there are real ways to help with life struggles.

Speaker 1:          18:51          So this video is sponsored by better help. I actually tried out the service myself. I spoke with a certified therapist named Jennifer and it was really pleasant. It was as good or better than any therapist I've seen in real life. So with better helping them communicate with the counselor via message, live chat, phone, or video conferencing, you can do therapy, whether you're in the pool, when you're walking your dog, whatever is most productive for you. So what I liked the most about better health is that it's accessible. People who normally wouldn't seek out therapy or don't even know how to go about getting it, can get access quickly. It's also convenient. Oftentimes when people do decide to seek therapy, it's only because they're at a really low point in their life. They're already desperate. And when you're in that state of mind, the last thing you want to do is jump through insurance hoops, knowing who's in and out of your network or who don't go through all that, paying exorbitant amounts or having to deal with stacks of paperwork. That's not the case. With better help, people are matched within 24 hours and it's completely confidential. So better help gets rid of the stigma. It gets rid of the hassle, and it makes therapy accessible and easy. So look, if you're like me and you think you could benefit from speaking to someone on a regular basis, consider checking out better help.com/wise crack or clicking here to get started. And as always, guys, thanks for watching

Speaker 11:         20:05          peace.
