Speaker 1:          00:03          I'm to call him.

Speaker 2:          00:05          What's up everybody? Jared again, today we're talking about a show that's definitely going to get us d monetized on youtube. Bursar based off the Monga, the same name reserve is one of the oldest ongoing series out there. The Nma premiered in 1997 before going on an almost 20 year hiatus and as returned with a controversial new animation style. Since the show is still going, we can't quite decipher the entire message here. So while guts quest for revenge against the God hand in Griffith deals with some fairly obvious themes ranging from religion to freewill.

Speaker 3:          00:35          No, no. Now that any meal, no cause it to you to Dr [inaudible],

Speaker 2:          00:40          we're going to leave that for a future video instead. We're here to talk about the most visually obvious and philosophically subtle aspect of the show. That's right. Preserves metric crap, ton of violence Wolgan Ms. Wise crack condition on the philosophy of violence in Berzerk and as always, spoilers ahead. Now, I know it might seem like the phrase mindless violence was coined to describe Berzerk, but what's going on beneath the surface of its bdsm inspired angels and gruesome deaths is actually pretty smart. Reserve is unique not only in how it uses violence to horrify and mesmerize us, but also to transform us. Do you understand the violence in Berzerk? We need to consider its genre while the influences of psychological horror, cosmic horror, and even core porn can be seen in reserve. The show specifically rests in horrors monster sub genre according to a stratasys, no carol monster horror has two very important implications.

Speaker 2:          01:33          One, horror as a genre affords us a critical distance allowing for a safe space for fascination to take root. Simply put, violence in real life is bad, but violence on screen is kosher to the monsters depicted on screen embody. With Carol calls categorical violation. They defy traditional categorizations and simultaneously attract and repulse for the same reason. It's these two points that make Berzerk so well preserved. Why are we okay with witnessing guts? Literally slice people in half because we view this over the top violence from a safe distance and why do we find these awful acts of violence so compelling? Because violence in the show like it's subject matter defies traditional categorizations. This blurring of typical categories and the fascination and repulsion that it generates is berzerk calling card. These binaries can be distinctions between life and death, such as when Guts Mo's down at group of animated skeletons or the distinction between man and beast and the apostles, but they can also be less literal. For example, Father Mo's goose head bulging sadist, extraordinary claims to be an agent of God but is actually serving the demons. He and his rag tag team of tortures even gain wings as if they're literally angels, Lady Far Niece. Now seeing the truth behind her order realizes what they actually are.

Speaker 3:          02:54          No,

Speaker 2:          02:57          even guts the epicenter, the show's violence embodies this idea of categorical violation. He's both a murderer and a hero and object of religious prophecy and an anti religious crusader in the original anime guts is branded as a ritual sacrifice for the god hand. A moment that was supposedly preordained, but guts managed to defy faith and survive. Guts is simultaneously an object of religious prophecy and a middle finger against faith or as far DC originally sees him and how guts sees himself.

Speaker 4:          03:41          Cool. Thank you. Let's cut. Can you cut a [inaudible] molecule down with day to day? [inaudible] it okay.

Speaker 2:          03:54          And much like the man himself. Guts is violence possesses this trademark sense of categorical violation. It repels us. Get attracts us. It's animalistic, yet refined. This is most apparent when guts puts on the brazer armor and blurs the line between man and beast. His armor even transforming to mirror this change. As guts releases a savage cry and charges the battlefield, he can't help but notice the compelling choreographed ferocity here as his opponent. Grunfeld note

Speaker 5:          04:23          taken to sue Minneola new employee.

Speaker 2:          04:31          And when guts delivers the final blow of the first bout, he does so with a grace that is more than anything. Well beautiful. While it might seem strange, according to thinker Joel Black and act of violence can in fact be beautiful in his book the aesthetics of murder. He writes, if any human act evokes the aesthetic experience of the sublime, certainly it is the act of murder. If murder can be experienced aesthetically, the murderer can in turn be regarded as a kind of artist, a performance artist or anti artists whose specialty is not creation but destruction. Of course, we're not giving the thumbs up to murder, but blacks point is that when performed with the right craft style and force, violence can have an almost transcendent effect on its viewers. This idea that something can leave us in awe and transcend understanding is what philosopher Emmanuel Kant referred to as the sublime or the state of mind created when a certain experience stops being an object of our judgment and starts controlling it.

Speaker 2:          05:35          Starting to sound familiar like monster hoard, the sublime has the power to violate the purpose in respect of the judgment and to do violence to the imagination. It works through a process of categorical violation, breaking down the divisions between our commonly held beliefs. So how does the sublime and preserve transform us by forcing us to reconsider our traditionally held ideas, specifically beauty throughout both the new series and the 1997 version, we are bombarded with intensely violence images that are in their own way. Beautiful. When Griffith in his band of heroes are monsters liberate for tennis from the invading who Shaun's Griffith see or Sonia comments on the aftermath?

Speaker 6:          06:28          No, you're this time.

Speaker 2:          06:32          Here are the senseless death and destruction wrought by griffiths army. Overwhelmed Sonia possessing a beauty that challenges her very idea of what is through tapping into the sublime. Violence in Berzerk frequently becomes a vehicle for change. Sonya opening her eyes to the dazzling death brought by griffith leaves her old life in the village behind and follows griffith on his journey to become God kit, but for Zurich is very careful to make sure it doesn't depict all violence as evoking this sense of awe. In fact, the show juxtaposes, the artful killing of guts and griffith with ordinary violence, seemingly common to everyday life, whether it's the villagers stoning someone to death or a night whipping a prostitute from the comfort of his horse. These moments are strangely mundane, petty and underwhelming. In the end, these figures, institutions lack the skill and artistry to evoke the sublime. If skill and craftsmanship are the keys to evoking total awe and wonder, Ben Guts can be viewed as something like a violent performance artists.

Speaker 2:          07:33          So what's the effect of guts? Is a visceral and bloody art doesn't have a greater purpose or is it just as French writer tail field got ta calls art for Art's sake? While it might be tempting to think it's the latter, guts is acts of violence do have a greater purpose demonstrating the hideous nature of the societal violence and ultimately disrupting it through the distinction between artistic and non artistic acts of violence. The show glorifies those that work against the grain of society, contrasting them with the drab cruelty of the institutions themselves. A prime example is griffith when he's reporting to the world fulfilling the wishes of the egg of the perfect world to up end of the world. Order

Speaker 7:          08:16          [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] no, no to to cure. So No [inaudible] statutes to Joe, so stay [inaudible]. She was scared. Touch

Speaker 2:          08:37          true to this cause. Griffith and his army. Take back for Tanis. In this instance, Griffith is working against society is upstart rebel army ousting the coo. Sean's in one fell swoop, but once Griffith Regan states the holy seize control of the city. He becomes in meshed in the established power structure. Typical the violence perpetrated by institutions. Ribbons, violence afterwards becomes tasteless and crude when guts and company arrived later at the city, they find hundreds of slave traders hanged as enemies of the state bar from possessing beauty. This scene is sterile, methodically organized and revolting to sharecrop. Unlike Griffith, though guts is violence is never part of a greater societal system. Guts fights only for himself making enemies out of whole armies, religions and even God like beings. In fact, the brand on guts is nick attracts demons and apostles continually forcing guts to abandoned society. In the first episode, guts attempts to reenter society by agreeing to take a carriage dried with a kindly man and his daughter. Guts falls asleep only for his brand to attract demons who slaughtered the father. Daughter duo. Instead, guts is curse to live and act on the peripheries of society is violence becomes a destructive force upon the world. Lady for niece realizes this. When she becomes disillusioned with the holy, see, as all hell breaks loose on the battlefield.

Speaker 3:          09:56          Oh, could I can let us know. Mrs [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          10:05          Guts is violence invoking the sublime becomes a powerful force that disrupts the status quo and forces people to renegotiate their core ideals for far niece. This results in her abandoning her post and even her God.

Speaker 3:          10:19          Could I take your statement

Speaker 2:          10:26          in tying artistic violence to the individual and unartistic violence to society for circus challenging us on where we focus our attention while we're drawn to be shining brilliance of guts is violence or seemingly blind to the everyday violence that takes place in the greater world of Berserk. We as viewers live for the battle scenes, the crystallization of violence, but this ignores the existence of structural violence or the idea that certain power structures can prevent less powerful groups of people from meeting their basic needs. True to form. Look who gets screwed over by society and preserve it should Doro is essentially forced into servitude being the glorified busboy of a mercenary group. Costco essentially a mental invalid. It's singled out for death by father, most gurus and almost raped by a strange fertility cult thing and Luca and her gaggle of young friends are forced to risk their lives by working as prostitutes at the base camp, both servicing military officers while simultaneously fearing those are very officer's judgments for circus.

Speaker 2:          11:25          Challenging our ideas of what piece really is. We like to think that peace begins when the battle stops, when guts has finished putting his opponents through the proverbial blender, but because we can't take our eyes away from dazzling acts of violence committed by guts and others were unable to notice or care about all the other acts of violence committed by society. It's in the lols between battles when reserve decides to show us the artless and repulsive violence in the world around them. In these rare moments when we see people stoned death or mountains of dead bodies or even a lake of blood and in trails, we see the limitations of thinking. That piece is simply the absence of war or battle. But for all those complex intellectual ideas, we don't blame you if you only remember preserve as the enemy. We're an anthropomorphic horse lik say semi naked woman and there goes the last of our youtube adsense revenue.
