Speaker 1:          00:02          Well, my main job is twice a year to cover the collections each season, the fall and spring season, so we've just had the New York shows this fall for spring clothing that will be in the stores for spring 2009. This weekend I will leave to go to Milan and I will spend a week. They're looking at the clothes from the Italian designers and then that will be followed by a little weakened adventists, which would be lovely and then onto a, which is a break and then onto Paris for a week of shows there. So those are the two main large blocks of time where I'm literally sitting in what the fashion engine, what I would consider to be, what the world would consider trade shows and they're the fashions fashion shows that are called the collections for ready to wear those clothes that you will see at various department stores and boutiques all around the country and all around the world as well as online.

Speaker 1:          00:53          That is followed by then a period where I come back from the fashion collections and make some pretty strong decisions on what trends I like. What I've seen, um, how I've amassed all this large grouping of plethora of clothes that are kind of bombarded me and everyone for about a month, um, make sense of it all and group them into stories, into themes and the things that I think will be relevant for my publication and for things that I think will be fun to photograph and shoot. And from there I developed the idea, think about what kind of imagery I'd like those ideas to be and think about the photography, the models, and how I'm going to actually really produce that idea. So it becomes an eight page, 10 page story in the spring issue of New York magazine.
