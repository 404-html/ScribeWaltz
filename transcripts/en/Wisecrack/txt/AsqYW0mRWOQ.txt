Speaker 1:          00:17          a wise crack. Disembody. Jared again here to ask you a question. Why are a repetitive Sitcom intro and an Ode to British Children's television? Two of the most disturbing things on youtube besides the obvious, is there a reason that this or this is more unsettling than say a dude who murders you in your dreams instead of cheap jump scares. Too many cooks and don't hug me. I'm scared into a kind of existential horror, but two different ends. So if you've ever pondered the eternal question of whether you'd rather be stuck in a song that never ends or an acid induced muppet nightmare, then this is the video for you. Welcome this wise crack condition on too many cooks versus don't hug me. I'm scared. And I guess spoilers ahead. For those of you who don't know, here's a quick recap. Too many cooks begins like the opening credits of most 80 sitcoms, like full house, different strokes or my two dads, and then just keeps going. As the jingle repeats, the opening credits mutate and begin to resemble things ranging from Gi Joe to Battlestar Galactica and it keeps going

Speaker 2:          01:21          and going and going,

Speaker 1:          01:27          and a serial killer shows up and look. If you haven't seen it, go watch it. It's so good. Don't hug me. I'm scared as a six episode web series that resembles British children's television shows like the teletubbies, but each episode quickly descends into terrifying psychological torture, complete with cultish fees. This embezzlement and uncomfortable amounts of raw meat, although they don't seem terribly similar, both utilize a special nightmare sauce that really gets under our skin that sauce king with nostalgia in too many cooks. The aesthetic of the comforting TV families of the eighties and nineties are quite literally murdered while in. Don't hug me, I'm scared. Our childhood mentors are inverted into orwellian despots, but what makes this worse than say, watching nightmare. On Elm Street, you see nostalgia offers three psychological benefits. It acts as a repository for positive feelings, a contributor to self esteem, and as a method of social connectivity because who hasn't read all 52 ways, you know you're a nineties kid, since nostalgia makes us feel so good, disrupting it can really mess with your head according to one school of thought called terror management theory, nostalgia can be a handy way to combat the terror of our mortal existence, no longer able to take comfort in God or an afterlife.

Speaker 1:          02:45          Our secular age has put more emphasis on other kinds of immortality, like having kids, making your mark on the world, having a national identity or having your Dick cast and plaster. This is where nostalgia comes in. At 2006, study found nostalgia helps to provide meaning in our lives by allowing us to relive idealized memories of our past in order to feel better about the future, but unlike some media that shamelessly parrots nostalgia to give us the warm and fuzzies. Too many cooks and don't hug me. I'm scared. Using this to log references to draw us in and then give us a good old fashioned mind rather than dressing up like ghostbusters. Too many cooks and don't hug me. I'm scared over. Identify with these references to the point of absurdity. They use the sappy intro music. Too many cooks dated retro graphics and simple puppets with bright colors to pull you into a nostalgic state and then under my so when everything goes to hell, they're literally ruining your childhood and not like the last jet I did.

Speaker 1:          03:47          The nostalgic fuel, good memories that pacify you on your meaningless trudge toward death are now being murdered both metaphorically and literally, but while both these properties utilize this subversion of nostalgia, it's how and why they subverted that sets them apart to understand what sets too many cooks apart from. Don't hug me, I'm scared. We need to look at the Early Twentieth Century Theater Practitioner, Bertolt Brecht, Brecht rejected realism and theater. Arguing that because film was so much better at it, why even bother theater doesn't have the endless takes multiple locations, camera angles, and perfectly mixed audio that puts you in the moment the way cinema does. Theater requires a lot of suspension of disbelief and audience imagination, so breck developed what he called epic theater. Epic theater sought to disrupt the audience performer relationship where traditional drama expected an audience to be sad when the protagonist is sad, frightened when he or she is frightened and so on.

Speaker 1:          04:43          Brecht wanted an audience to view the performance more critically and dispassionately. To do that, he used a technique called distantiation or the alienation effect. For instance, he would show the workings of their performance on stage to reveal its falseness in his play, mother courage and her children. Costume changes happen on stage. Props and scenery are brought on and off during dialog and placards are held up to explain the action. Also, the audience can't escape the awareness that they were watching a play and thus are able to judge the characters more critically. Old birdie basically patented our culture's favorite thing, breaking the fourth wall like Brecht. Too many cooks draws our attention to its own falseness. Characters run between sets that are stocked by their Chiron's. The audio and video are disrupted and whatever. This is another characteristic. Too many cooks shares with Brecht is repetition.

Speaker 1:          05:37          In almost every Brecht play, there is a form of repeated dance movement, gesture or phrase, even in the music. Consider the Alabama sauce, which you might recognize. It's an awesome song by the doors. Well, Brecht wrote the lyrics. Rhythm and instrumentation are highly repetitive and the harmony uses a lot of dissonance to achieve the general feeling of creepiness on bestows upon the listener, and if you two are creeped out by the song, then congrats, Brex alienation effect work. The more you repeat something, the more likely you are to look at or to listen to it critically. Seeing it a different way like have you ever repeated a word until it sounds like gibberish? Just like saying, pigeon pigeon, pigeon, pigeon for a minute straight, we'll make the word pigeon sound extremely weird. Hearing the phrase, too many cooks over and over throughout and 11 minute video will remove any and all meaning the phrase too many cooks ever had, but were Brecht would often use this distancing effect to explain an injustice or challenge or prejudice.

Speaker 1:          06:34          Too many cooks has a much more nihilistic view of the whole thing. Every component of popular entertainment is distance and robbed of meaning. For instance, the repetitiveness of the phrase, too many cooks spoil the broth seems to parallel the repetition of other Sitcom catchphrases like, hey, even as more and more unsettling elements are introduced, the repetition renders it all meaningless and uses this opportunity to show how interchangeable at all is as our characters get murdered are greasy. Serial killer begins to inhabit the generic and interchangeable tropes and aesthetics of television. By deconstructing these old shows in this graphic way too many cooks up ends. Any attempt at terror management through our nostalgic love of he-man married with children or buck rogers by revealing them to be empty, easily replicated junk all for a joke and a great one at that. Don't hug me, I'm scared. Use this a lot of these same techniques of distantiation to like breaking the fourth wall by rotating a digital image of their set and repeating camera moves and dialogue over and over. I wonder what will happen,

Speaker 3:          07:43          but

Speaker 1:          07:43          don't hug me. I'm scared. Has more in common with a different type of pop culture deconstruction. Whereas too many cooks is deconstruction for its own sake. Don't hug me. Subverts nostalgia too. Not only criticized children's television, but to offer a way forward, but how exactly. Well, first we need to talk about something that sounds really boring. The British television act of 1954, which allowed commercial television networks to compete with the publicly owned BBC. Following the television act, a new commercial channel called Independent Television was created in 1955. A fact not lost on. Don't hug me. I'm scared in the Erie fundraising campaign. Trailers, a violent bear monster demands money from the audience using a ransom video conspicuously timestamp as 1955. With this in mind, the reason for deconstructing children's television becomes a bit clearer. Subtle clues, take jabs at the very idea of children's television for profit or even profit in general throughout it's six episodes. The three main characters, red guy, duck and yellow guy are terrorized by different guest teachers, like a notebook that explains creativity. What's your favorite ice is being creative, a clock that explains time. Time is a tool you can put on the wall or wherever it on your wrist. The past is far behind us. The future doesn't exist. Nap Ap, that explains love for some reason.

Speaker 4:          09:09          Together we get understanding

Speaker 1:          09:12          on the surface. This seems like any episode of Barney or whatever kids watch these days, but as the fourth wall starts to dissolve, everything gets weird. Herder is trippy and even profound. One could argue that this bat, it insanity and the unexpected guys have a kids show is been to expose the authoritarian and consumerists messages using a method known as culture jamming culture. Jamming is a tactic used by anti consumer as groups to subvert the dominant narrative and iconography of our era, mainstream media advertisements and so on. This means revealing the message that is quote, really behind popular media and advertising and injecting their own meaning to serve their agenda. I think of the coke billboard that says love, but someone spray painted profit underneath it, or a Mcdonald's billboard modified to read. I'm loving diabetes or anything banks he's ever done or vermin supreme, a man who wears a boot on his head and wants to mandate brushing your teeth by law all to mark our political process.

Speaker 4:          10:11          This election year, vote early, vote often. I remember a vote for me, vermin supreme. It was about completely thrown away.

Speaker 1:          10:16          This method of deconstructing a well known institution like children's television by jamming it with another more graphic image highlights the disparity between wholesome edutainment for kids and the excesses of profit driven media that the television act introduced throughout the series. The teachers in every episode explain what something is or means, but start to suggest better ways of doing things.

Speaker 4:          10:42          Could you're not thinking creatively

Speaker 1:          10:45          correct. The main characters.

Speaker 4:          10:47          It's not by name. If you can do it. Oh, they did,

Speaker 1:          10:55          and punish them if they do or say what the teachers see as the wrong thing. Wanting to be creative. Don't use green. That's not a creative color. One. Eat fancy foods. Sorry. They'll clog up your body.

Speaker 4:          11:07          Ten feet. Foods are very rude. I must leave through the cat flap.

Speaker 1:          11:12          While these choices of excluding green or choosing a computer over a globe to learn may seem inane and meaningless at first, they slowly begin to reveal what is at stake. These saccharin notion of a child's TV mentor is jammed to reveal the dangers of letting media teacher child in the harsh realities of the commercial age and the touch of authoritarianism that is inherent to it all attempts to question their teachers are always shut down.

Speaker 4:          11:37          It doesn't make sense. Let me just. A construct of human perception and illusion created by.

Speaker 1:          11:47          Furthermore, the danger of empty platitudes about love devolve into a cult.

Speaker 4:          11:52          His name is

Speaker 1:          11:54          age. They can't get loud. Optimism about technology is juxtaposed with some clockwork orange in the computer episode. What you do with a computer seems to be dancing graphs and more importantly, style as in, you know, buying clothes.

Speaker 4:          12:10          Wow.

Speaker 1:          12:16          The last few episodes even seemed to drop hints that this is all a plan to sell oats to kids. Our computer teacher asks the puppets a series of questions like it's for a focus group and on the question of what do you like to eat? Our beloved computer shows us another picture of oats. In the next episode, Our teacher tells us the merits of plain foods and more oats are seen next to the healthy juice. This gives. Don't hug me. I'm scared. A much more moral message than too many cooks while too many cooks literally self destructs the message of, don't hug me. I'm scared. Instead, alternate methods of childhood education. Try managing your terror with that. Just like almost everything else in pop culture right now. Too many cooks and don't hug me. I'm scared. Recognize how we use nostalgia as a safety blanket and then soak that blanket in blood and rip a few holes in, but while too many cooks says that's because this kind of nostalgic is a lie and ultimately useless.

Speaker 1:          13:06          Don't hug me. I'm scared. Ruins our childhood because it loves us. It wants you to challenge the lessons you've learned instead of blindly obeying that comforting kids. Show voice. So do me a favor.
