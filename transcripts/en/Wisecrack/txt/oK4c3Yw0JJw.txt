Speaker 1:          00:00          This video is sponsored by movement watches in sunglasses, more on movement. At the end of this video,

Speaker 2:          00:07          hey,

Speaker 1:          00:08          for one disembodied jared here, back to talk to you about the Merc with a mouth. Now, deadpool probably means a lot to you. It's sharp wit is a welcome reprieve from a torrent of superhero movies. Nobody's getting hurt and we're sure dead pool two will be no different, but I'm here to talk about something else. Not only, as we've mentioned previously, is dead pull a kind of microcosm for the ironic distance that pervades our culture, but it represents a lot more. Does deadpool hold the secret to how people can get you to buy more stuff? Welcome to this Blob, blah, blah, blah, and no spoilers ahead this time. Can we say that? Let's begin our story with the most recent adverts for deadpool two, the teaser at the beginning of Logan and the wet on wet trailer. Both of these succeed free, very simple reason.

Speaker 1:          00:55          They actively refuse to do what normal promotional material should do in the Logan teaser. Deadpool takes too long changing in a phone booth while a hapless civilian gets brutally assaulted. In the end, he's too late, but being honest with myself, I probably should have just called nine one one. The whole thing pokes fun at one of our cultures. Oldest icons, superman and for good measure, a random essay about the old man in the seat. We're still scratching our heads at that one. Maybe it has something to do with Logan and Santiago, sacrificial nature. I Dunno. In the trailer, wet on wet deadpool. Don's a sweet fro in a soothing Baritone, imitating Bob Ross's the joy of painting even before Deadpool, our cultural obsession with Bob Ross has always included a little dose of irony and if you tell them,

Speaker 3:          01:36          and it wasn't that, that bushes there, I will come to your house and I will cut you.

Speaker 1:          01:41          The wholesome public television show full of dad humor and happy little trees became an internet sensation. It's naive. Authenticity became a joke for disillusion. Millennials,

Speaker 2:          01:51          I'm not a very good fisherman. I catch a little fish and take the hook carefully out of his mouth. Put a bandaid on him going the CTR patty one to two two and putting back in the water

Speaker 1:          02:00          in wet on wet. The colors are movie jokes. Bob Ross's very real obsession with whacking his brushes is highlighted.

Speaker 2:          02:07          What's that often shake off the excess and just beat the devil out of. That's really the most fun part of it

Speaker 1:          02:17          and the chief engineer is one jury La Forge. Both of these are awesome, right? When I saw them in theaters, people were losing their shit, but is there something more to it than just, it's funny if anything, these promotions are anti promotions by flaunting their absurdity. They mostly avoid teasing the actual movie they're promoting held. The first deadpool movie marketed itself as a Romcom at one point. Surprise. This is actually lucky. You are love story. Instead of promises of cool fight scenes in a suspenseful plot. The whole pre logan trailer just raises doubts about Super Harrowing in general is a phone booth doing on a street corner and wet on wet has a real trailer packed on the end of a series of not so subtle in you with no relation to the movie itself. It just get high and all laughs splendor. God, I love cocaine and here's the point. The secret of self promotion in 2017 is to make fun of the very fact that you're being self promotional.

Speaker 4:          03:12          That's supposed to sell deodorant. Talk about something real like the smooth, sophisticated center mall spice.

Speaker 1:          03:19          The secret is cynicism, but to understand why this is uniquely successful today, we have to turn back to a guy who lived in a barrel and made philosophy out of pissing in public dialogue. He needs, the cynic was one of the progenitors of Western cynical philosophy. It's disputed whether or not he's the reason we use the term cynicism to describe his school philosophy, but the term cynic, which in Greek means dog, like what's at the very least an insult hurled. At diageo, he's by his contemporaries, but either way, he really embraced the term and made a habit of urinating and fornicating in public just like our four legged friends, never one to half ass anything. Even tried eating raw meat, not unlike our foul mouth. Tiro Dodge and he spent his time berating the customs and habits of his peers, whereas dead pool may successfully type cast his peers, oh, come on, it'll leave me all alone here with less angry rosie o'donnell.

Speaker 1:          04:11          They are genies would do things like stop on Plato's carpet yelling. I trample on the pride of plato running into Plato's classroom with a plump chicken screaming, behold Plato's man and ordering his remains three thrown over the city wall so that wild animals could feast on his corpse. The point for [inaudible] was to be relentlessly cynical toward the habit and customs of the well to do with Finian's if they viewed themselves as noble purveyors. Of Truth. Dow Ginny's would carry around a lantern in broad daylight telling those around him. He was searching for an honest man if they thought defecating in public was beneath the dignity of a civilized man, die jays would drop trau right in the middle of the [inaudible]. It's not an entirely different than these superhero that refuses to be a hero.

Speaker 4:          04:53          Ooh, and Cherry Garcia ice cream. I can eat this, but

Speaker 1:          04:59          despite their similarities, deadpool and diage needs are fundamentally different. At least according to the logic of philosopher Peter slaughter died for slaughter dyke. If diageo has represented a pointed criticism of his contemporaries, cynicism today has become universal and diffuse permeating every aspect of our culture. News, film, Video Games are all made cynically, and we even perform our jobs with a cynical indifference. The logic boils down to, hey, at least it's a paycheck on a global scale. Slaughter Dyke was writing in the 1980s but he might as well have been riding today if diageo needs publicly performed in such a way to rid the world of bad ideas. Modern cynicism is merely a resignation to the fact that everything is terrible and while deadpool is perfect proof of universal cynicism, that doesn't actually change anything. Also consider the steady stream of self aware advertising that succeeds by virtue that it rejects it's berry premise. Men. Lebron James made a sprite commercial for the super bowl where he ironically and repeatedly affirms the, he'll never tell you to drink sprite. Let's get one thing straight. I'll never tell you to drink sprite. Even if I wasn't a commercial for sprite, which I am. New Castle made a superbowl ad about how they couldn't afford a superbowl ad.

Speaker 5:          06:16          Turns out they don't even have the money or permission to make us more so they can't even say the word. Basically, the only thing I haven't done is a nude scene and get paid money to be at a commercial for a beer. I don't even drink

Speaker 1:          06:27          cards against humanity. Made a whole black Friday campaign out of mailing people poop and if mailing people poop is a metaphor for successful marketing in our modern age. Deadpool's advertising is the Creme de la at her to film promotion.

Speaker 5:          06:39          Hold each of your man berries or as I like to call them, smooth criminals,

Speaker 1:          06:42          trailers that aren't trailers. A superhero who is not a hero. Per Brazil's comicon. Deadpool released a video where he offers a supposedly heartfelt attempt to connect with his Brazilian fans by saying the show my dedication to the yeah

Speaker 5:          06:54          legions of Brazilian deadpool fans. I've spent up to 20 minutes on Google translate as well as countless hours watching Tele novellas to teach me everything about your official language

Speaker 1:          07:06          before offering up eight clearly not deadpool, voiceover

Speaker 5:          07:09          you're goes [inaudible], [inaudible], [inaudible],

Speaker 1:          07:16          but perhaps nothing exemplifies this trend. Like a recent rick and morty old spice at Rick Sanchez introduces some anthropomorphize old spice products in a board monotone before counting neath thousands of dollars he just made for the shameless promotion for slaughter died. This is what separates modern cynicism from the cynicism of Diageo. Our modern economy is compatible with nothing, quite so much as the limitations about the corrupting effect of all mighty money. Money makes the world go round. Isn't that terrible? What makes this work for advertising to you? Slaughter dykes words is that cynicism is criticism with limited liability. Deadpool can joke about the budget constraints of his own movie,

Speaker 5:          07:53          Big House. It's funny that I only ever see two of you. It's almost like the studio couldn't afford another Eczema

Speaker 1:          07:58          or even its own lead.

Speaker 5:          07:59          I think Ryan Reynolds got this far on his superior acting method

Speaker 1:          08:02          and in doing so protects itself from any judgements about budget constraints or acting resumes for slaughter died. This is fundamentally different than the cynicism of diabetes they are needs met the customs and ideas of his peers with pure satirical laughter. It worked because he also constructed an alternative living like a stray dog out of a giant barrel. In response to the contemporary definitions of citizenship, he declared he was a citizen of the world. Rather, our modern cynicism lacks any alternative, whereas some thinkers posited that the masses will follow their leaders with a false consciousness. A metaphorical wool pulled over their eyes. Slaughter Dyke posits that modern cynicism is enlightened false consciousness. We are acutely aware that there is wool over our eyes, but we safe get wall is warm and cozy. Creators may know an advertisement is stupid, but on a commercial is so annoying, but you got a great product or a superhero trope is overused. Superhero landing, so you're going to do a superhero landing, but hey, gotta pay the bills, right?

Speaker 4:          09:02          Whoa.

Speaker 1:          09:03          Superhero landing. The alternative is to make a movie that no one watches or a youtube video. I'm still hurt about that one.

Speaker 6:          09:10          Yay.

Speaker 1:          09:14          Consider the painting at the end of wet on wet. It's an alteration of Norman Rockwell's freedom from want depicting a wholesome family ready to eat a giant Merica size Turkey, part of his four freedom series based on the FDR speech. The message was, here's what makes America great. The freedom to pray, to eat a ton of meat, to feel safe and to speak your mind. In typical deadpool fashion, a wholesome image is robbed of its original meaning. This is another microcosm of our cynical era. Straightforward defenses of any kind of values are scorned as naive at best and at worst are vulnerable to being wrong. Considered the worst advertisement of the century. Pepsi's Kendall Jenner ad we're a can of diabetes. Water brings together protesters and riot cops. On the one hand we all cringed because the ad cynically watered down social movements to sell soda, but the real mistake was to defend anything at all, even if behind the scenes it was cynical.

Speaker 1:          10:06          If the add added a few do not attempt in real life or results not guaranteed. We want of all laugh that such a self aware add cynical advertising upfront about its own cynicism is smart advertising. It's advertising with limited liability, so it shouldn't surprise us that figures like superman, a symbol of heroism and goodness or Norman Rockwell's freedom from want draw the ire of dead pool slaughtered. I quotes Georg symbol who said, the more money becomes the sole center of interest, the more we see honor and convictions, talent and virtue, beauty and health of the soul mobilized on monies behalf. The more a mocking and frivolous mood will arise regarding these values which are offered for sale for the same kind of value as goods on the weekly market. Deadpool is the embodiment of this frivolous and mocking mood because heroics and values are for sale. How are we not supposed to laugh at them?

Speaker 4:          10:57          Please don't make it super suit green or animated.

Speaker 1:          11:01          And because there exists no conceivable way to escape the system, we criticize like perhaps diageo needs. The cynic could. What else are we to do?

Speaker 4:          11:10          Wow.

Speaker 1:          11:11          So what do you think is cynicism and marketing the best way to advertise these days? Well, let's find out. Have you decided it's time to step up your style game?
