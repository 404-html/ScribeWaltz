Speaker 1:          00:03          Hey, wise crack, jared here. We saw coco last week, every one cry, and then once we got past that God awful frozen short film, they were all good tears. Coco is a film filled with color, both literally and in it's authentically rich portrayal of Mexican culture, but aside from the heartstring tugging moments and gorgeous animation, it also presents a really interesting perspective on death that we don't often see in cinema. Will come this quick. Take on cocoa and prepare for major spoilers. Also, warning, I'm going to put your all the Mexican names. I'm a Gringo Sumi first or recap seven. Mexico young Miguel Rivera loves music and wants to play guitar like his hero or nested dela Cruz, but music is banned in the Rivera family since his great, great grandpa left his family to pursue a career in music. After Miguel steals dela Cruz, his guitar on Dia de Los Muertos, he's transported to the realm of the dead.

Speaker 1:          00:53          Believing dela Cruz is his great, great grandfather Miguel ventures to find him in hopes of receiving his blessing to return to the living world. Getting to this mega celeb is a hell of a challenge, but luckily his new pal hector agrees to help him in exchange for putting up Hector's photo on his family's, a friend of a shrine with pictures of our dancestors so he's not forgotten and is able to visit the land of the living to see his daughter. Stuff happens and it turns out that Miguel's great, great grandfather is not Ernesto, but hector, who's beloved daughter is Miguel's great. Grandmother, Coco dela Cruz, murdered hector stole his songs, his guitar, and ultimately his chance to be remembered by his family. Miguel returns to the land of the living sparks, Coco's memory of her father by singing protectors. Picture on the agenda and they all live or die happily ever after, as evidenced by the number of hipster sugar skull tattoos I see in Los Angeles.

Speaker 1:          01:44          Many Americans are fascinated by dia de los muertos and Coco isn't the first animated film that makes use of that setting. In 2014, Twentieth Century Fox put out a movie called the book of life, which also features a boy who was shoes. Family tradition to pursue music is transported to the land of the dead on Dia de los Muertos and requires the help of his ancestors to return to the world of living. Even though these films feature similar plots, they couldn't be more different and their portrayal of debt in the book of Life Minolos dead ancestors basically exist only to assist in his journey and give the producers and excuse to cast ice cube in your story that is presented as something static once your dad. That's it. If you're remembered by your family, you get to party and if you're forgotten, you're a sad sack, but either way you're dead.

Speaker 1:          02:34          Coco elevates this concept by introducing a second kind of death beyond the biological be symbolic death of being forgotten once there's no one alive who remembers you, you disappeared from the land of the dead, passing away a second time. That second death is brought on solely through relationships to others in cocoa. It's People's memories that mark the difference between life and debt, and interesting way to think about this is through the lens of philosophers. John Beaudry, who talks about death as a kind of social relation, the Western cultural understanding of death has been filtered through science to the point where we now think of death as a primarily biological phenomenon. Once your heart stops and your fingers start rotting, your dad, boatyard compares this to certain non Western cultures in which death has a symbolic relation of exchange with the living in these cultures, not only his death, something both given and received by the living, but the dead can give and receive as well.

Speaker 1:          03:27          Cocoa Explores this system of mutual exchange between the living and the dead. Miguel needs the help of his relatives to return to the land of living, but they need his help as well. Hector makes a deal with Miguel to bring his photo to the a friend that in exchange for his assistance in getting home and on Dia de los Muertos, the other living characters interact with their ancestors. Despite not being able to see them that eat the grave sites bring offerings and authentically honor those who have passed. It's only the exchange that occurs on Dia de los Muertos that prevents the dead from experiencing the second, honestly way more terrifying death that happens when you're no longer remembered. Boatyard says that in most western societies that kind of two way exchange between the living and the dead doesn't exist. The dead aren't a group that the living interact with and the more society is obsessed with rationality, the less of a role dead people play among the dead people we do remember we put them on money and on posters and learned about them in history class, but we don't think of it in terms of a relationship.

Speaker 1:          04:24          We don't expect anything from the dead and we don't offer them anything either. Even the idea of this sounds pretty wild, but this removal of the dead from our social interactions changes the shape of a culture. Eventually Boatyard says, when the dead don't interact with the living, they become obliterated. We see this obliteration in Coco when individuals stop existing once they no longer have living relatives to participate in that exchange of remembrance and celebration and Care Church, our own, the only person we witness experiencing that second death doesn't leave a body behind the way he certainly did in his biological dad. His skeleton fades and all that slept. Defendant is a guitar and a bunch of junk in a Hammock, but while memory might be enough to save the dead from permanent extinction, they suffer when they aren't able to return to the living and interact with their family.

Speaker 1:          05:11          Just had a really hard the other night. Could we be using them equal right now? Memory matters, but the living have to be willing to give something more than that. For Baudrillard. This give and take between life and death would mean that dying and being born are not necessarily opposites. They're part of this big system of exchange as well, and death can be traded for live via social interactions, and although he's not talking about Coco, although we wish he was, hector's shift from being forgotten to being celebrated among his descendants is in a sense a kind of rebirth. Although he hadn't quite crumbled into dust yet. He's at risk of being obliterated. The moment coco forgets him and the spark of her memory brings him back to life. Even though biologically he's still dead as a doornail. When Coco herself eventually dies, she's reunited with her parents in the land of the dead.

Speaker 1:          06:01          She's their child again. Even though she looks about twice their age combined with them, she makes her journey back to the land and living for their yearly visit. The fruitful exchange of Dia de los Muertos still involves cocoa, but now from the other side of your friend up, there is a reason that people cry when Miguel sings. Remember me at the end of the film. It's a moment of connection between Coco and her long gone father, but it's also a command to all of us, not to forget the dead. The performance of the song brings symbolic life back to hector, but the words of the song itself celebrate the importance of life beyond death. For a kids movie that's pretty damn profound. Although coming from Pixar, we wouldn't expect anything less. Coco gives us all the good stuff's sweeping musical scores and shots so colorful. It's like shooting up a box of Crayola is, but it also makes us think is true death when your heart stops beating or when there's nothing left, if you in people's memories is the mark you leave on the world.

Speaker 1:          06:56          Really it's own kind of immortality. Thanks for watching guys. I hope you love Coco as much as we did. Piece. Thanks for watching wise crack.
