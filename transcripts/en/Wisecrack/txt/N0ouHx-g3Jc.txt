Speaker 1:          00:03          What's up wise? Crack, jared. Again, Jurassic world, fallen kingdom has been absolutely obliterated by critics and audiences alike. Calling out it's unfunny character's lack of originality and worst of all, the unforgivable sin of not enough cif gold flute. Now there's a lot to be said about how the latest Jurassic movies haven't amazed us in the same way that Spielberg's 1993 original did, but at least Jurassic world seemed somewhat aware of its inherent shortcomings. Let's be honest, no one's impressed by a dinosaur, but the Jurassic world follow up. Falling Kingdom shows how far the franchise has fallen on paper, though it actually seems to have something going for it because unlike it's 2015 predecessor, the movie actually tries to develop the underlying moral question of the original. It moves from, should dinosaurs be brought back to life too? Should we consciously let dinosaurs go extinct again? No one can deny that fallen kingdom looks absolutely stunning at times, but despite the magicians of dollars thrown at the special effects budget, the movie is still so boring.

Speaker 1:          01:10          So why aren't we more immersed than ever? Well, let's find out in this wise crack condition on Jurassic world, fallen kingdom. What went wrong? And spoilers ahead if anyone cares. Let's briefly recap. For those of you who've already left this movie go extinct in their minds after the destruction of Jurassic world at the closet, the in dominous rex, the dinosaurs are left to run the island freely once more. However, fast forward three years and a volcano on the island is about to blast little foot and ducky into extinction once again. Oh and then claire, don't lie, you forgot their names too. Don't want this to happen. And join a rescue team in an effort to save as many of the species as they can. So the stage is set presenting us with perhaps the most action packed high stakes situation and Jurassic Park history while simultaneously evoking the main ethical and moral questions that made the original.

Speaker 1:          01:59          So beloved, should we take responsibility for our own creations and save the dinosaurs from their second extinction? Or should we bow down to mother nature and let the volcano deal with our incompetence once and for all? So let's see what we got here. Developing themes from the original check, sweet digital effects and action check. Everyone's favorite killing machine check. So what could possibly go wrong? Life finds a way by contrast, the original Jurassic Park came out 25 whole years ago in a time when CGI was still in its infancy. So it shouldn't surprise anyone that the handful of computerized dinosaurs featured in the original aren't exactly up to par with today's CGI. So why is it then that the age action sequences in Jurassic Park still feel more engaging and memorable than the visually superior set pieces have fallen kingdom? To answer this question, we need to go back to the man who started at all Steven Spielberg and his own words.

Speaker 1:          02:57          Spielberg avoided making just another monster movie and this was not going to be a genre of horror science fiction fantasy. He didn't want Jurassic Park to revolve around scary monsters chasing after helpless one dimensional characters and said he wanted the film to focus on the journey of a group of relatable characters who have to deal with the reality that dinosaurs have been suddenly brought back to life. For Spielberg, the original drastic park was a human story, not date dinosaurs eating people's story. It's not just about the visual spectacle of witnessing a man getting eaten off the toilet by a dinosaur, but the emotional journeys of the characters and it's with this knowledge in mind, don't be uncover why this is infinitely less yon inducing. Then this insanity take for instance the now iconic t-rex scene in Jurassic Park, just as our protagonists are passing by the enclosure of the king of all dinosaurs, the park's power grid is suddenly turned off leaving the mighty rex free to go wherever she pleases.

Speaker 1:          03:57          The biggest man eating animal in the world escapes and our protagonists are the first pray to cross her path. What follows is a roughly six minute action suspense sequence in which our protagonist try their best. Not to. Getty seems pretty straightforward, right? Well, yes and no. Even though the characters trying to survive is what is literally happening on the screen. It's what's going on under the surface that matters from a story perspective isn't as much about the introduction of the t rex as it is about the protagonist Dr. Alan Grant learning to become a father at the beginning of the film, we're introduced to the idea that Dr. Grant is not exactly the kind of guy who lets his nephew when at super smash brothers. In fact, Spielberg really tries to hammer home that grant doesn't like kids and would rather remain obsessed with the dead past. Then thinking about creating life in the future, you want to have one of those.

Speaker 1:          04:50          We're also briefly notified that Hammons daughter of the mom of these two kids is going through a divorce and you telling me that Hannah Kinney, have you gone in to see me? He had to leave early. He wants to be with these daughters. She's getting a divorce. I understand that. So even though we're all just anxiously waiting to see newman gets skeeted on by a Deloft, the source, the stage is set for the underlying theme of the movie family. Let's head back to that pivotal scene. Donald, the only adult in the car with the kids suddenly feels his breakfast Burrito twirling around in his bowels and decides to dip out and head to the nearest bathroom. The kids having been abandoned by yet another male authority figure are alone and panicking. Dr. Grant immediately realizes he has to make a decision. He can either remain still and decrease his chances of getting eaten or act in a selfless, somewhat fatherly manner.

Speaker 1:          05:40          Alan, one repression of father instincts zero. It's moments like this that elevate the action from Amir. Will they survive to how will the characters grow as they try to survive? So when good old rexy breaks through her own glass ceiling at the start of a sequence, it's not just mere spectacle, it's action in service of character growth and theme. It engages us not just because it looks cool, but because we can relate to the story on a personal level. Jurassic world, fallen kingdom, on the other hand, has almost none of this. Sure. At the start of the story were reintroduced to be moral and ethical questions surrounding the survival or demise of the dinosaurs on the island. Do dinosaurs deserve the same protections given to other endangered species or should they be left to die? But we learn next to nothing about the internal lives of the protagonists.

Speaker 1:          06:30          So even though its main action set piece might be visually far more impressive than the t rex scene without this underlying layer, what you see is what you get Chris Pratt running away from dinosaurs and lava. It might be a feast for the eyes, but it starves us emotionally. Let's look at another example from the original right after the t rex breakout scene, Alan has to try and save timmy who still trapped in this car. Unfortunately for them, this tree can't hold the cars weight and it's about the drop and crush our protagonists to death in fallen kingdom. We see a similar action sequence unfold when Claire and Franklin have to climb a ladder to escape a hungry dinosaur whose only barely being held back by a dripping wall of lava. It doesn't seem too different from the falling car setup, right? Well, the difference here is that this moment, 10 drastic park isn't just a random moment for the sake of suspense, but that it again serves to develop the theme of the story.

Speaker 1:          07:24          Just like can you ask, she asked. His Dad is affiliate treatments. Alan is again forced into a position in which he has to act as a father in order to save timmies life, and even the climax of the sequence with Alan and timmy miraculously surviving the car, falling down on them serves a purpose instead of just being a copout cliche to trick the audience into thinking that the characters have died on the tree. This moment is used to show the metaphorical rebirth of Allen like a dinosaur from an egg. He's no longer the dinosaur obsessed child diverse man he once was, but instead has embraced the possibility of being a future father. Now that's an action scene packed with meaning and yeah, you probably guessed it. Falling Kingdom has nothing like this, like Alan and Timmy Clare and Franklin also barely escaped their deaths in the nick of time.

Speaker 1:          08:14          But that's all there is to it. Nothing about the characters or their relationship has changed. And so there's no meaning to it beyond survival. So what could have been a visualization of their inner growth ends up being another vapid spectacle since the characters remained virtually the same. So the reason why this action scenes still grabs us 25 years after its inception is not just because it first introduced us to the t rex, but because of how it uses action in service of the underlying story, it tells two stories at the same time. One that excites us and add suspense and one that people can truly relate to. Combine the two and you have an action sequence that engages audiences across time, no matter how prehistoric it's visuals, all the pieces were there to make a thoroughly enjoyable and memorable film, perhaps equaling or even surpassing the original a film with the same sort of engaging emotional subtext as the original combined with the advancement in digital effects could have made for something truly special. And yes, I'm sure some people had a blast watching Chris Pratt runaway from dinosaurs and giant melting rocks, but will these scene still truly live on in the minds of those same people 25 years from now? Needless to say, we have doubts, at least Trev row in Bayona made sure that the series wouldn't evolve further into a mindless monster movie by repeating the same mistake Spielberg made in the lost world.

Speaker 2:          09:43          Oh,

Speaker 1:          09:47          if you're sad that all the real dinosaurs went the way the fidget spinner don't be, there's actually plenty of prehistoric monsters that's still roam the earth. And to the best of my knowledge, none of them will go all newman on you. Take, for example, the great salamander, who for the past 160 million years has remained relatively unchanged, and there is a version of it that's so nasty that early American settlers named it after health fun.
