Speaker 1:          00:18          Greetings and welcome to earthling cinema. I am your host Garrick's where ameloid this week's artifact is it based on the novel by the sovereign of intellectual property, King Stephen and storing the cutest scars guardian of the galaxy. The film takes place in an alternate reality where earth children rode bikes everywhere known as the ats. Our sort of protagonist is build in Bro, who despite his name breaks the first rule of bro Code. When he lets an unemployed artists eat his brother, a year passes and bill's still butthurt about his dead brother. He's dead. So his loser friends search the septic tank with them only to find it more barren than my first wife. A local Hussey named Bev short for beverage joins the crew to up the diversity and the boy, his blood pressure and a stranger things start happening. The kids make a shocking discovery.

Speaker 1:          01:11          The only haunted looking house in town is haunted and it's where it lifts. Turns out the artist is actually a bogert named pennywise who's preferred Pronoun is it dad? When pennywise totally screws with their analog powerpoint, the kids try plan a walk into it's trap house. Since Bev probably took all their plan B and after successfully stabbing its head, they disband for no reason. That is until pennywise teen naps Bev to show her his latest installation bill and Co's save her cause they hate modern art and take turns punching it even though they could have done that at literally any time. Pennywise goes down the pipes back to the mushroom kingdom and the most rocking summer ever ends like all rocking summers with a blood oath. At its core, it is about battling fear and is not at all about child orgies. Pennywise lives in the sewers beneath dairy surface reflecting the subconscious nature of its attacks and how hard it is to find a good one bedroom fame. Psychopaths, siggy fraudster would call this amalgamation of subconscious concerns into one representative token condensation. I call it Dad Dad.

Speaker 1:          02:26          Ed's fear of disease is baked into this dude with Eczema. The painting in Stan's father's office represents the pressure on stand to learn how to read the Rabbi's son Ken finishes on Taurine. The bloody scene in beverages bathroom reflects her insecurities about her changing body as is quickly losing carbonation. The film explores the conditions under which fear and evil may flourish. Pennywise finds a comfortable home in dairy because the adults are indifferent to the town's problems like the high murder rate, constant amber alerts or the lurking killer childhood obesity. By feigning ignorance to these issues, the adults enable it just as they allow bullying and racism to do its thing. The film suggests that being alone renders one more vulnerable to fear and to spending an entire day naked on the couch throughout the film. It attacks victims one on one cause it's not really into group stuff.

Speaker 1:          03:18          The antidote to indifference in isolation is friendship. Okay? It's a 64,000 be the losers are only able to defeat it by facing it together and sharing their emotional burdens, even though all they had to do was hit it with a stick. When Bev decides to go. All Terri Shiavo. It's Ben's gesture of friendship that snaps her out of it. A classic true love's first base, like many kings, steven ips. It is about coming of age to legally bone. The film as an allegory for the transition from childhood to young adulthood, also known as the hood. In the beginning. The characters are helpless. Children controlled by their overbearing parents and the beliefs who terrorize them, you're trap.

Speaker 1:          04:01          They are painfully aware of characteristics that make them different. For Billy, it's his oral, your hair. For Ben, it's everything except his personality. And for Mike it's being the only black character in the movie. But as the children unify and battled the monster, they learn to assert power over their own lives. Graduating from helpless children to helpless teens, despite its uplifting message. The film makes it clear that evil, much like herpes can never be eradicated without a ray gun, just as pennywise will inevitably wake up in 27 years. This stuff seems to happen every other 27 years. Evil such as racism and abuse will eventually rise up and get a hit movie too. And it did in the 2075 box office. Hit racism and abuse. Save Christmas, earthlink cinema. I'm Garrick's learning what goes up. Must come clown. If

Speaker 3:          04:57          there's anything we get asked time and time again, it's jared. How can you still be Gareth's as intern after all this time and it's actually a funny story. Late last year, Garrick's promoted me to graphic designer, just white, having no experience whatsoever. Attempting to airbrushes eyebrows. I failed miserably even though I could have used skillshare, the online learning community with thousands of classes, the final product was a nightmare and knowing garrick's you can probably guess what happened next. I was fired, lost my salary and was forced to sleep on the streets and he used Napkins to survive. That is until I got a premium membership on skillshare and unlimited access to college grade courses on skills that would allow me to get hired back and sent the subscription has less than $10 a month. I took all the courses I would need dynamic brand identity, fundamentals of dslr photography and mastering logo design. Armed with all these skills. I ask Eric for my job back, and he overwhelmingly said no. So I grovel to my hands, went numb, and he reluctantly hired me back as an intern.
