This isn't the first time we've talked about this season of south park, but for lack of a better phrase, just to briefly recap, the season so far, south park has been exploring the feeling of hopelessness in the modern world, whether it's school shootings, Predator, priests, outrage mobs or east suitors. Nobody asks for South Park has been showing us and exhausted population resigned to the fact that nothing can be fixed. It seems like South Park is once again evaluating their legacy in the world. Last season's southmark reflected on their impact on the culture. Most obviously scene in the episode super hard. Penis in which kyle be standing for the show itself condemns the harmful effects of terrorists and fill up another standard. The show,

Speaker 1:          00:55          although the previous season never made a definitive statement whether or not south park is harmful. Something interesting has happened in the last few episodes with the recent reintroduction of man bear pig, Matt stone and Trey Parker seem to be taking their efforts at self evaluation. A step further, in fact, their new message seems to be more akin to a full fledged. We're sorry. So welcome to this wisecrack quick take on South Park season 22 episodes six and seven, and of course spoilers ahead. Now, for those of you who haven't seen season tends episode man bear pig or just don't remember stuff from over a decade ago. It features our Gore warning south hearts, children of the half man, half bear, half pigments, dressing. I'm spreading man. Bear pig awareness. Hear each of your kids take a pamphlet and a bumper sticker. Mr Gordon takes them on a farcical hunting to a cave where the children almost died even as he believed that children have died. Al Gore gets super stoked about his alleged defeat of man bear pig and how people will in turn be super stoked on him.

Speaker 2:          01:57          I killed. I've saved the earth from certain destruction. Everyone is

Speaker 1:          02:03          for stoked on me. Man. Bear pig at that time and now was a super cereal. Not so subtle. Stand in for climate change. Gore had released his film an inconvenient truth that same year, and while one might view the joke of man bear pig, to be mostly about Al Gore's attention seeking behavior,

Speaker 3:          02:20          you just use pig as a way to get attention for yourself because you're a loser.

Speaker 1:          02:25          There are plenty of hints in the South Park Cannon that Matt and Trey didn't take climate change too seriously. In the season five episode, terrence and fill up behind the blow. We get this.

Speaker 3:          02:34          Uh, excuse me. My daddy is a geologist and he says, there actually isn't any concrete evidence of global warming. That's not true.

Speaker 1:          02:41          Global warming is going to kill us. All the Republicans are responsible and in the season nine episode, two days before the day after tomorrow, people wrongly accused a flood on global warming.

Speaker 3:          02:52          Oh Jesus.

Speaker 1:          03:03          When in reality stand just crashed the boat into a beaver dam. Shout out to our Fan Malcolm for pointing this out, man. Bear pig also escapes from imagination land. The implication being, you know, climate change is imaginary. Now man, bear pig is back and it seems like Matt and Trey have changed their tune on the issue. Do what you remember, dude warned about this, that Weirdo guy who came and told us what happened, he was right in man, bear pig is real and the show is now going out of its way to not only associate man bear pig with Gore's past warnings. Oh, is it inconvenient? Now, I tried to warn you all, but no one took me theorial, but to admit that they were wrong to trivialized his claims. In fact, when it comes to making fun of climate change blowhards, it seems like they have a different target now.

Speaker 1:          03:48          There's no scientific proof, no real evidence of a man bear pig. Why are you trying to figure out what's going on with scientists? Matt and Trey also take aim at people who waffle around about whether or not they should worry about man bear pig to begin with. It looks like Satan is here. Should I start to worry, which is a stark departure from this. Even if global warming war real, which all proven scientific data shows it is, and it would take millions of years for our climate shift to happen and as smoke fills the landscape of south park, it seems like they may even be referring to the recent wildfires in California. Their apology decor is made most explicit in episode seven.

Speaker 3:          04:29          What more do you want from me? I've atoned for my mistake. I'm sorry that we were getting a lot of gifting information at the time. You know even you were wrong about a lot of the things you said would happen.

Speaker 1:          04:37          That's not to say they're letting up on the almost 43rd president of the US. He's still painted as a narcissistic Douche who cares more about the image of himself as a heroic climate advocate than actually dealing with climate change. So now that the show recognizes the real threat of climate change, what is to be done? Well, if you're an adult in the town of South Park, the answer is Jack Enter the game that I wish I was at home playing right now. Red Dead Redemption. Two, all the adults from sergeant gates to randy to the cops to even Satan analysis score. You're playing red dead redemption. Two so good, right are playing and for the most part, they're too busy escaping to their new hyper detailed, wild west second life to deal with something as depressingly hopeless as man bear pig, not unlike the reaction to Sharon and episode one.

Speaker 3:          05:25          Sheldon were shocked they were killed at a school where they were supposed to be safe.

Speaker 1:          05:33          What else is going on? The adults of South Park are more keen on dismissing problems than addressing them.

Speaker 3:          05:39          Maybe he's going to kill everyone and he's gonna. Stop.

Speaker 1:          05:41          Well then I guess I don't have to do anything about it, but more importantly, this man bear pig business makes some pretty clever parallels to the idea of a faustian bargain. Bargain comes from the German tale of faust who through a contract inked and blood sold his soul to the devil, exchange for knowledge or worldly pleasures and isn't a convenient that I will miss. Character comes back for this episode. Belsky and bargains are everywhere in literature and film, sometimes with the devil and sometimes not, but the basic premise is that one achieved some goal in exchange for some kind of horrifying fate, like an eternity in hell. We soon find out that man bear pig is a fate sifting demon who made a faustian bargain with grandpa marsh. He's sacrificed the future for some sweet cars and even sweeter ice cream here on the show is making a clever not to the argument that the economic prosperity of one generation has left the current one. As Stan says, we're stupid. Band applied. A bunch of other old people made the deal with Mandera. Peggy. It's here because of their greediness screening and the most tragic thing about it and why we think this fits with our previous thesis of this being the season of resignation is that Grandpa is right in the end. Man Bear pig offers to leave south park. If they agreed to give up red dead redemption and soy sauce,

Speaker 3:          06:57          he said they'll never come back again, but we have to give up soy sauce and red dead redemption. Two. Okay,

Speaker 1:          07:02          why soy sauce? Well, it's probably an illusion to the fact that soy farming to supply both humans and livestock has cut down a whole lot of rain forest in the Amazon and the south. Partake. Take Mandera pick up on this offer. Just the ride. Nope. And for everyone who wants to blame baby boomers on destroying the planet, the kids are just as greed.

Speaker 3:          07:21          Could we possibly talk about restructuring a new deal? Uh Huh. Nah. The

Speaker 1:          07:25          episode ends with another foul skin bargain. This time, literally a contract that shifts the chaos of man bear pig on to the future. There's actually an economic takeaway here. The idea of an extra banality, as you probably know, the basic building blocks of an economy are a lot of smaller exchanges. I give you some wood for your sheep and we've completed a transaction that has made both parties happy. People agree to exchange different goods and services. And as a result, the world exists well as it does, but an externality complicates our understanding of two private citizens making a private deal. That's because some exchanges have a spillover effect or some kind of external consequences to the trade. So if I pay Alec $5 to let woody on his neighbors smelling my dog's gnarly poops is an externality of that transaction. One they never asked for enter South Park.

Speaker 1:          08:19          This faustian bargain with man. Bear pig is a literalization of how externalities work. The town gets to keep soy sauce and red dead, but someone down the line has to deal with the external consequences of that transaction. Namely man bear pig slaughtering everybody when he comes back, but more literally, it's about how private consumption of cars, gas, ice cream, red dead and soy sauce impact people who were never involved in that exchange to begin with. Now, in real life, cars produced carbon dioxide that enters the entire world's atmosphere. Ice Cream uses milk from dairy cows who are fighting their way towards humanities demise and red dead. Well, there's probably an argument to be made about heavy metals and your playstation or something. South Park locates these externalities geographically and sign here that man bear pig has rights to the lives of all children in third world countries, which points to how poor people, especially in developing countries are way less able to cope with rampant forest fires, food shortages, and rising sea levels and temporarily as much of the externalities related to climate change will go on to be some other generation's problem

Speaker 4:          09:24          and you didn't get to what it would mean for your grandchildren. I didn't think I'd have grandkids. I didn't even want children. That's why I always came on. Graham. Graham's

Speaker 1:          09:34          so has southpark matured this season by apologizing for their dismissal of what now seems to be a very real issue. Sure, they may have recognized that they were wrong, but they still leave us with a classics health part. Conclusion. Mankind sucks and there's nothing we can do about it. Hooray.
