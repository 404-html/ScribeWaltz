Speaker 1:          00:10          Hey, wise crack jared. Again. While we were working on our philosophy of Savio, I came across something very unexpected. Apparently critics have noted a structural similarity between the soft films and French philosopher John Paul Sartre is famous play no exit, so I watched all seven movies, read no exit and immediately called Bolt. The connection was too tenuous. Then Jigsaw came out and when I saw this I was like, Huh, welcome his wife's crack condition on the philosophy of Jigsaw and if you want more jigsaw related content, head on over to wise crack plus on Patrion for an exclusive podcast that dives deeper into the movie and as always, spoilers and decapitations ahead like all saw movies, Jigsaw starts with a game. Each player has to confess the horrible sin that snag them and exclusive invite to the world's worst warehouse party. If they don't confess, they'll turn dead AAF given the chance to save their skin. Each of the players take a solid pass offering. Half-Baked Confession,

Speaker 2:          01:10          not an accident. 10 minutes after I felt like to work

Speaker 1:          01:18          professing their innocence Honi my soul is clean. So one by one they're voted off the island. Meanwhile, an assortment of Sketchy Detectives and forensic pathologist try to figure out why gnarly corpses keep popping up all over the city could the very much dead John Kramer Bita blame. Eventually the film's creepy detective and creepy forensics guy come face to face in the ultimate creep off and we find out that the forensics guy is the new jigsaw you're working around. I am man. Oh and by the way, everything you just watched actually happened 10 years ago. But don't worry about that. Instead of focusing on the timeline fake-out we're zeroing in on what brings fans to the soft films in the first place. I want to play a game. The wholesome games. See in the past, jigsaw had one main party trick building traps to heinously and creatively torture people. But in the latest film, Jigsaw has moved into a more psychological realm, forcing his victims to confess their worst sins. Both versions of the game consist of forcing a person to choose between two unattractive options.

Speaker 3:          02:21          There was only one open the decline

Speaker 1:          02:28          in the first seven films. Cramer asked each victim to choose between door a inflict excruciating pain on themselves or others or door b give up and die, but in Jigsaw it, the game's been updated. Now his victims must choose between door a confessed to their worst sin in front of a group of strangers and make it home in time for adult swim or door be die a painful death.

Speaker 4:          02:50          While I am sure there is a desire to point fingers at me to the blog, that has been shit, unless you can turn that thing inward,

Speaker 1:          03:00          I assure you more blood will be lost. The game is still sprinkled with head gnashing, leg ripping devices, et Cetera, but these are more of a side show, a background threat perhaps to encourage honesty. The evolution of Jigsaws gain positions, the act of confessing as the painful alternative to death, the central form of suffering that takes place in the film. Unlike the other films, confession, not to be burning, slashing, or ripping a flesh is treated as the harder, more pain inducing moral alternative to instant death. But let's backtrack for a second. What moves jigsaw to devote his life to making diy medieval torture devices in the first place? As we explained in our philosophy of saw episode Kramer shares the early Christian view that suffering can be transformative and even life changing, so enduring his traps can strengthen a person's moral character and even redeem them for past naughtiness.

Speaker 1:          03:53          As leader of this crossfit for the soul, Jigsaw establishes himself as a godlike figure, imposing his moral agenda on his captive. Similarly, jigsaws new game draws from another aspect of early Christianity, public confession and public pennants wild today centers can spill their guts in a low key gossip session with father superior. Third Century centers were frequently required to confess their worst deeds in front of their entire Church congregation and act known as Xml, Jesus, and also a total bummer according to early Christian writer Tertullian. Excellent. Well, Jesus was an act meant to humiliate the center, essentially rendering them so totally pathetic. They would move God to mercy. Likewise, Kramer demands the confessions of his captives in hopes of shaming them. Once confession was over, the person moved on to public pennants where the humiliation only got Richard Tertullian claims the center would be instructed by their bishop to do things like lions, sackcloth and ashes.

Speaker 1:          04:52          The ashes were a sign of mourning for your peace, spiritual condition. They were forbidden to bape and had to eat only unseasoned food and drink to pass. The time. Centers would prostrate or lie stretched out on the ground, groaning and crying while begging their church leader and fellow churchgoers to pray for them. In Jigsaw, Anna seems to be taking a similarly penitent pose as she begs Kramer for mercy. So like a third century church leader, Kramer demands that his captives publicly confessed their worst deeds and boy do they clam up the second cigs. I'll ask them to talk about their past in previous installments. The basic human desire to keep both eyeballs has made for a compelling reason not to follow jigsaws commands. This time it's just the characters shame that makes them reluctant to air their dirty laundry. This creates some decidedly baffling moments. Best exemplified early on when carly finds out that Jigsaw has injected her with a poison that can only be cured by an antidote found in one of these three needles. One is the antidote, one is harmless and one holds a potent acid that will melt her face off and not in the fund. Electric Daisy carnival way partly figures out which needle would save her life because one is numbered. 3.5300000000000002

Speaker 5:          06:10          what does that mean? Who worse to me,

Speaker 1:          06:13          which is the exact amount of money she got after robbing and killing someone to admit that though would serve as a kind of confession so she doesn't say anything. So that happens. So why wouldn't carly confess? It seems odd unless you consider the clue helpfully graffiti tag on the wall. That sign isn't just there for fire safety. It's a reference to John Paul Sartre is famous play no exit. First a quick breakdown of the play. Three dead souls. Inez is still and Joseph meetup in hell though this version of hell is less fire and brimstone and more waiting room. Wondering how they ended up there. It's telling Joseph make like the solving items and lie about their crimes.

Speaker 5:          06:54          The studio. Yes. What have you done? Where are they send to here? Well, that's just it. I do know. In fact, I'm wondering if there hasn't been some terrible mistake.

Speaker 1:          07:08          Eventually each confesses their worst deeds. Both Estelle and Joseph feel the weight of judgment for their crimes. So what does this play have to do with your favorite torture porn series? Both center around a group of strangers trapped in a room awaiting an unknown but presumably horrific punishment. But perhaps a saw producer was guilty of wikipedia hang himself because the eighth film really doubles down on the no exit shtick in ways, both big and small. Notably, there's an eerie similarity of the crimes committed by Sartre's character. Estelle and Jigsaws. Anna, uh, still after becoming pregnant by her illicit lover, drowned her newborn baby as he looked on

Speaker 6:          07:47          and he could see what I was up to. He kept on shouting. It's style for God's sake, don't he saw it? Oh, he was leaning over the balcony. He sold the ring spreading on the ward.

Speaker 1:          08:08          The words he killed himself in grief.

Speaker 6:          08:12          That is he wished he made. He blew his brains out.

Speaker 1:          08:15          Similarly, Anna suffocated her newborn child, but convinced her husband it was his fault forcing him to commit suicide, but now for the principal's similarity between jigsaw and no exit, the emphasis on the painful nature of confession. Do you understand why confession is so hard in both works? We need to examine sartre idea of the look which he illustrates through the following example. Imagine that you're spying on your roommates awkward breakup through a keyhole. Suddenly you become aware of that your other cooler roommate is down the hallway watching you act creepy and judging you for it. This state of awareness of being watched by others is called the look. When you become aware of the look, you are forced at least momentarily to embody the viewpoint of what [inaudible] calls the other or an outside entity with its own separate consciousness and embodying the other's viewpoint. You feel a major discomfort.

Speaker 1:          09:08          I he shame, which costs you to pretend that you weren't spying. You were just smelling the door knob extended over a lifetime. Your awareness of the look causes you to live in authentically or what Sartre calls bad faith. Bad faith is basically a failure to properly use your freedom or take responsibility for your actions. And Kramer's prisoners certainly seem to be living in the baddest sort of faith. Take Carly, despite her clear choice to let a woman die by not giving her an inhaler, she sees it as an accident. However, searcher would tell carly that even in choosing not to do anything, she's still exercised her free will and made a choice to watch this lady asphyxiate. Similarly, Mitch, Anna, and Ryan all lie revising history to make their crimes seemed like accidents or honest mistakes. Kramer essentially accuses his captives of first being criminals and second of living in bad faith

Speaker 2:          10:10          in the past who have all put your room and to see if the world about your callousness, your criminality

Speaker 1:          10:22          here. Notice Kramer's focus not just on each individual's crimes, but on their subsequent lies. Self deception and cover up.

Speaker 2:          10:29          No, you wouldn't look in the mirror face who you really are. The choices you have to feed the hyphen. You cannot escape the truth.

Speaker 1:          10:41          Sartre, similarly used the mirror as a metaphor for the look of the other. Of course, Kramer's captives won't look in an actual mirror. He means that their crimes will be reflected back to them by the judgment of their fellow prisoners. That judgment can be torture all by itself, like a reverse bear trap for your soul and no exit. After the characters confess their crimes, they suffer anxiety about the judgment of their peers. You didn't. The funeral fret about their reputations on earth slumped in the chair. Is that thinking Gaza as a code? Let's got to think of something that Jeff Guss on a and beg for reassurance that they are not bad people.

Speaker 7:          11:22          Just someone just one test would say positively that I did not run away, that I'm not the sort of man. He runs away, that I'm good and brave and decent and all the rest of it.

Speaker 1:          11:32          This leads Joseph to utter the famous line. How is other people not just because someone always leave their cell phone on in the movie theater, but because the existence of other people means the existence of their judgment and the shame that ensues. That's particularly true. If like Joseph, you're hanging out with people who know your worst secrets. If Hell is other people knowing your worst deeds, it makes sense that confession is Kramer's new favorite torture device. He's trying to force his captives who face Joseph's anguish by making them publicly take responsibility for their choices. For instance, he makes Ryan relive his own worst deed as a drunk teenager. His joy ride inadvertently caused a deadly car crash. He escaped responsibility for it and tell all these years later,

Speaker 2:          12:19          I want to live

Speaker 1:          12:20          now. Searchers version of hell in no exit is not the only one that the saw series references. John Kramer also must have studied up on Dante's inferno and it's the 14th century is how he and poet to picks his own presumably fictional journey through the nine concentric circles of health, each housing eight different brand of sinners suffering for eternity. Dante is hell is governed chiefly by a rule called Contra Paso Latin for to suffer the opposite. Under Contra Paso sinners suffer punishments that are either related to or the extreme contrast of the crimes they committed on earth. For instance, astrologers and false prophets are forced to walk forever with their heads turned backwards. A punishment for trying to look into the future or when the powerball chronic suck ups are buried in excrement because, well, you know, importantly, the rule of Contra Pato means that a person's eternity in hell is predestined by their own freely chosen sins.

Speaker 1:          13:14          Throughout the saw series, cramer's show some flair for Contra Paso punishment. Think of the time he forced a heroin junkie to dig through a pit of needles in search of a key. Get it like her addiction is the trap or the cruel money lenders who had to pay for their lives in pounds of flesh or the voyeuristic sex offender who had to gouge his eyes out or lose all his limbs. Kramer's traps and Jigsaw also share some of the same, uh, poetry as Dornase and Ferno. For instance, we learned that Mitch sold a motorcycle with a faulty brake to Kramer's nephew who later died in an accident. So what was Mitch is trap secure this brake lever or be sliced up by a circular metal blade and a jams of the machine and we think Mitch is saved but fittingly, her homemade brake lever is faulty and Mitch plummets into a death spiral. Later Kramer presents the last two survivors, Anna and Ryan, what their final game in the form of a single shotgun and a vague riddle. If you want to achieve

Speaker 2:          14:11          your freedom, you have to realize we've been doing it backwards

Speaker 1:          14:18          and I immediately lunges for the gun. Assuming that to win the game she has to shoot Ryan, but then a broken key falls out. Cramer had stored the key to their freedom inside the weapon. Here, Anna shows that she hasn't changed. She remains willing to ruin or take another life to save her own. According to Kramer's reasoning, Anna is ultimately trapped and killed not by his game, but by her fundamental moral failings or jigsaw stops. Making sense though is when her choice also Ryan to be trapped in the barn after he at least somewhat assumes responsibility for his deadly joy ride. And from there on Jigsaw seems to abandon any semblance of a moral lesson moving from the doomed barn adventures to the less interesting laser color trap holding detective Halloran and Logan, the forensics guy. They each make their own confessions.

Speaker 3:          15:11          I'm so sorry.

Speaker 1:          15:14          And then logan fakes his death, comes back to life and reveals that he's the new jigsaw. Then he leaves Halloran first debt savage Logan May be John Kramer's one man tribute band, but will he further the moral philosophy of the series? Looks like we'll find out soon enough. There's already talk of a ninth saw movie with Logan's final declaration I speak to. It sounds like we're in for some forensic pathologists gone wild, but what do you think was jigsaw and insightful philosophical inquiry or just an excuse to watch a guy gets shredded into confetti and is loken a generic creep with all the charisma of a latex glove or the fresh new villain. The sauce series needed. Let us know in the comments and as always, thanks for watching peace.
