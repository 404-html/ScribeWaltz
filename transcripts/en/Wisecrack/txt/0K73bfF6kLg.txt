Speaker 1:          00:04          My name is Graham Hill, founder of tree hugger and Interactive Planet Green. From, from here we all but now we're in Montreal and in the woods.

Speaker 2:          00:18          Uh, I think it's very much shaped sort of where I, where I ended up. So my parents were hippies and really the community around there and my parents' friends were largely people sort of getting back to the land. And so I lived in a log house and learned a lot about sort of conservation

Speaker 1:          00:37          and nature from my child. My parents certainly did help it vary a bit.

Speaker 2:          00:49          They're very green in the own way. My mother is a vegetarian, has been for many, many years and I certainly remember many lessons of conservation from my father in a more general sense. My stepfather was very inspirational and that he just helped me believe in myself and just believed that I could do whatever I wanted to do and that I was a special person. And so he was very influential and then some, certainly some great teachers along the way. My, my childhood, uh, later on it was more books, I guess I used to read fiction back then. So he was sort of different. Um, I don't even know if I can remember. I mean, I read it, I read, I certainly was a very much a bookworm. I loved reading. Um, I don't think they inspired me in the same, same way. I mean maybe it's our creativity later on was more more books like a Gandhi. I found very inspiring. The, his is a biography or autobiography and certainly books regarding green regarding evolution, like a beak of the finch by Jonathan Wiener, natural capitalism, uh, by the 11th

Speaker 1:          01:59          and Paul Hawkin both very inspirational. Pardon me from my parents, certainly. So I think I was always somewhat

Speaker 2:          02:12          conscious of it, conscious of it, but really it was only a. So I was vegetarian for quite a long time. I've certainly lived in terms of live with less sometimes due to finances. I think it really was, it was, it was sort of later on though is the sort of mid, mid twenties to late twenties. I really started thinking about and reading about it and, and, and, and getting more concerned about how I lived and what

Speaker 1:          02:41          back I might have with the businesses that I might create. I always thought I'd be an adventure and I think that's, that's what I became. And

Speaker 2:          02:54          I, I still, I'm a creator. I like to, I like to build things and I think that that basically is what an adventure is. I do some products, I do some media.

Speaker 1:          03:04          Yeah, you know, I could do various things, but really ultimately I'm an inventor.
