Speaker 1:          00:00          This video is brought to you by skill share.

Speaker 2:          00:05          Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:06          What's up guys? Jared again. Today we're talking about the Walt Disney of animate hi Yao Miyazaki with 11 feature films and over 125 major awards under his belt. Miyazaki's become a household name even in the West. So what gives the films of me as Aki and his team of bad asses at Studio Ghibli that extra Miyuzaki feel well beneath all the curse tentacle pigs and giant cat bear things. There's a cohesive philosophy at play here. The Japanese religion of Shinto welcome, this wisecrack condition on the philosophy of Miyazaki and you know the drill spoilers ahead. A recurrent theme throughout all of me as archies films is a love for nature. At times. This can be fairly over the top, such as in the battle between the humans and the forest and princess monotone. Okay. What I want is for the humans and the forest to live in peace or the battle between the various armies and bugs and Nasca of the Valley of the wind.

Speaker 2:          01:01          Humans cannot live.

Speaker 1:          01:05          Actually let's roll the opening credits for Nasca for a second. Yup. There it is. The throne even comes with the World Wildlife Fund stamp of approval. While we could chalk all these moments up to me as Aki being a tree hugger, seriously, he's actually opening a nature sanctuary later this year. We think it has more to do with Shinto, which holds a deep respect for nature. For the uninitiated, Shinto is an ancient Japanese religion that believes we share our world with a variety of gods and spirits called Kami. Importantly, comey is both singular and plural, referring not only to the myriad of spirits in the world, but also the divine essence that connects all things. This interconnectedness is critical to understanding the religion, whereas you and I might see a giant tree and think, wow, that's a big country. A shintoist might recognize it as a your machito or an object in which a god can reside.

Speaker 1:          01:56          It's no longer just nature, but part of the divine fabric of reality and as such deserves our respect. And while Japan is one of the least religious countries in the world, over 80% of its population participates in Shinto traditions. Seriously. The only thing Japan has more of than shrines are vending machines. But how does this all relate to nature and Miyazaki? Well, according to historian Lynn white religion plays a large part in shaping a culture is treatment of the environment. For example, Judeo Christian tradition state that man has dominion over fish of the sea and over fowl of the air and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth. Basically in the west nature has historically been our bitch. But in Shinto, because everything possesses a spiritual component, the religion is non anthropocentric. Humans aren't at the center of the universe. And for our boy Miyazaki, that means that his films deal a lot with peace and loving between human in nature. So if you're wondering why the protagonist from NASA, the Valley of the wind, continually to make peace with some pretty terrifying bugs. Well there you go.

Speaker 3:          03:04          Please forgive us for disturbing your nest. We're very sorry. We are not your enemies. We mean you no harm.

Speaker 1:          03:11          Consider my neighbor Totoro when sisters Sawicki and May Coosa Kabe moved to an idealic village out in the country, they find themselves living alongside a whole host of spirits in their attic. For example, running around the go, hey, or a charm that blesses a house is a swarm of little suit sprites. But instead of portraying these adorable little guys as other worldly, the local wise woman treats them like familiar wildlife or a kind of ghost, then don't worry dear then nothing to be afraid to have. If they decide you're nice people, they won't harm you. And after a I live, just go wait. In this world, spirits aren't something to fear but rather a part of everyday life. This casual acceptance of spirits place in the world and the respect they deserve is captured in small moments throughout the film. Like when sought ski gives thanks to a local shrine for offering her shelter from the rain or when the Coosa Kabe family pays respects to the your Shiro in which the god of the forest Todaro lives. Thank you for watching over May and making us feel so welcome here. Please continue to look after us and it's through befriending these spirits, particularly the large totaro that our heroes resolve the films. Big crisis when may goes missing at the end, it's towed. Rowe who helps sought ski find her with the help of this weird cat bus thing. I seriously, I don't know what to call that.

Speaker 1:          04:36          By having his protagonist respect both the spirit and the wildlife they inhabit. Miyuzaki inverts traditional Western views toward the environment in the west. We've historically looked at the land in terms of its instrumental value, what it can do for us. For example, aristotle remarked in his book, politics. Nature has made all things specifically for the sake of man and for us red, white and blue blooded Americans. We can see this in the concept of manifest destiny II, how we must spread out across the country and convert all this nature into usable land. In short, we're consumers and the earth is our Walmart. However, if we factor in that the land is imbued with spirits, then we have to concede that the earth might have some intrinsic value, I. E. Value for its own sake, much like haunt formulated that people or more broadly rational agents must be treated as an end, never merely as a means.

Speaker 1:          05:30          So too must the land which is full of thinking, rational spirits be treated as an end, not as a means. And it's in how these two perspectives on nature fail to meet that we find the root of conflict in me as archies films. For example, look at Ponyo Miyazaki's take on the little mermaid in it. The Magician Fujimoto opposes his daughter Ponyo his desire to become a human on the grounds that they use the ocean for their own gain. In fact, the only why Ponyo ends up meeting the little boys so ski in the first place is because she gets swept up by a passing ship, trawling the ocean, or in layman's terms, when a ship essentially rakes the ocean with a giant net destroying reefs and underwater habitats all for a quick buck. When Fujimoto finally recovers Ponyo he offers some pretty scathing criticism of mankind.

Speaker 1:          06:17          What do you know about humans? The score in the sea. They treat your home like the empty black songs. That was one slung. I go, what she wanted myself. I had to leave that all behind to serve the earth. That's right. Apparently you can't love the ocean and be human at the same time. And to be fair, this clash between intrinsic and instrumental value has some pretty dire consequences because ponos father refuses to let his daughter become a human. And because Ponyo refuses to go back to being a fish, the natural order of the world begins to fall apart. The moon falls closer to the sea. The waves take on a life of their own, and half the town looks like a coloring book page inspired by the day after tomorrow. But so ca ponyo manage to stave off the end of days by proving that humans can love nature for itself in the most literal way possible. After helping so skate traverse the flooded island to get back to his mom, Ponyo uses up all her magical power and returns to being a fish when asked by pose mother, the spirit of the earth and goddess of mercy herself. If so, ski knew that Ponyo was a fish and could love her. Anyway. He responds,

Speaker 4:          07:22          I love

Speaker 1:          07:24          so demonstrates that humans can intrinsically value nature by actually falling in love with the fish. Relieved Ponyo his mother puts her daughter in a bubble and with a kiss from so skate Ponyo transforms permanently into a real girl, thereby putting the world at ease again, while Ponyo chooses to ground this mismatch of values and a Romeo and Juliet sorta way more often than not in Miyazaki films, we see it embodied in the conflict between nature and technology and perhaps nowhere is this interplay more noticeable than in me is Aki is darkest work. Princess modern. Okay. In the film prints, Asha Taka travel to the industrial holdout irontown to understand what's causing the great spirits of the forest to become cursed. As it turns out, irontown under the leadership of Lady of OCI has been cutting down the forest in order to bolster its own supply of iron in choosing their own material gain over the sanctity of the forest. The residents of irontown have started an all out war with the god of the mountain, a war which Asha Taka is determined to stop. What's particularly interesting is how the townspeople viewed this, these four station in relation to the idea of progress before lady of Bocce came along, they tell Asha Taka that it was impossible to settle here.

Speaker 4:          08:32          The problem was before we could dig for the iron, we had to clear away the forest and that's what made the board angry.

Speaker 2:          08:43          Hello?

Speaker 1:          08:52          Then one day the lady bull, she came along with their warriors in the right. Awesome. This last point is important. The town's people view iron and guns and more broadly rationality as a vehicle for progress with science and rationality on their side. Humans think they can live anywhere and to anything, but it's exactly this mindset that philosophy's Ron Swanson. Martin Heidegger says leads to a warped idea of reality because we're focused on viewing nature only through the lens of science and technology. We're blinded to the true essence of things. So trees become, would beaches become iron sand and a giant walking God becomes a big pain in the ass. Nothing is sacred anymore. And this is especially true to lady of Boshi. She's not even afraid of that God, that woman. And while the forward march of technology has brought some good to the townspeople, empowering women and giving work to the literal lepers of society, it also comes with some pretty big drawbacks. Namely angry wolves, bores monkeys, and some pretty nasty curses. So what's the overall takeaway here are all of me is Auggie's films just thinly veiled odes to nature. And it's the message really as simple as trees are good in technology is bad. Well, let's not go full thorough just yet. After all, nature can be pretty damn scary. And me as Aki films in the futuristic apocalyptic nightmare that is NASA, the Valley of the wind, the humans live in a world invaded by a toxic jungle,

Speaker 5:          10:21          told to believe these spores can kill me without a mask.

Speaker 1:          10:26          Oh yeah. And did we mention these swarms of massive killer insects that live in it? Similarly, spirits aren't always your friend in Miyazaki's most famous work spirited away. The little girl Chihiro enters a mysterious deserted town with her parents only for them to be turned into pigs and you hero's quest to change her parents back. Chanters a service of an evil witch you Baba and runs into this unruly patron, no face. Yep. Not exactly a friendly figure like Totoro, but if nature and spirits aren't always good, then it stands to reason that society and technology aren't always bad. Case and point in the wind rises Miyazaki's last film technology is never presented as something to fear. In fact, it's freak events of nature like a massive earthquake and disease that creates a lot of the conflict in this world. As the protagonist juro learns in one of his many dream sequences, airplanes for him aren't the same as lady [inaudible] guns.

Speaker 1:          11:24          They're not meant to do battle or to further materialistic gains as his idol. Giovanni caproni states airplanes are not tools for, they are not for making money and plains are beautiful. To me, engineer's turn dreams into reality. In the end, what it all seems to come down to is the idea of respect and balance. In Shinto certain actions create a sense of ritual purity. They give peace of mind to your own spirit and those around you, the dead must be for their souls to be at peace. Local gods and wildlife must be shown respect and their sacrifices even for the benefit of mankind must be honored. If not these angered spirits can become cursed or you know this.

Speaker 1:          12:09          It's not a matter of land being good or technology being bad so much as it is about living in harmony with the natural world to hammer this point home. Let's have a quick look at castle in the sky, which follows the young boy Pazo and the princess sheet does quest to find the long lost flying city of La Pito. As it turns out, she does ambulate points the way to the city and with the help of some friendly air pirates, the duo racist to reach Lapino before the military, but when the pair of finally arrived, the city's not what they expect in the century. Since it's abandonment lop, UTA has become overgrown with plants and those scary robots in the distance while turns out they're more of the big friendly giant variety. Instead of killing people, they tend to the wildlife and much like in the Shinto tradition, they also pay their respects to the debt.

Speaker 2:          12:54          You've picked another flower for the grave. How kind of you?

Speaker 1:          12:57          In essence lobby that has become the perfect synthesis of nature and technology, a giant tree even growing around its main crystal and power source. It's only when the army arrived and particularly Mooska that this status is broken as Mooska violently ripped through the vegetation that has taken over Lapi does control room. He attempts to turn the city into a massive weapon watching goose because disregard for the natural world. She to finally realizes why her people left die in the first place.

Speaker 2:          13:26          Now I understand why the people of Laputa vanished. There was a song from my home in the valley have gone to with it explains everything it says, take root in the ground, live in harmony with the wind. Plant your seeds in the winter and rejoice with the birds. And the coming of spring, no matter how many weapons you have, no matter how great your technology might be, the world cannot live without love,

Speaker 1:          13:51          determined to stop Mooska Pausey when she needs it, then recite the forbidden spell instead of letting Musco break the balance of the world, they destroy lapita all together. As the city crumbles though the tree and the power source remain intact. Soaring through the sky together. So what do you think wise crack. Should we value wildlife for its own sake, spirits or not? Or should we value it for what it can offer us? Maybe if not materially, at least in quality of life or is it about a balance in all things regardless of the answer.
