Speaker 1:          00:04          I was cracked. Jared again, you might have noticed that Sasha Baron Cohen, the mind behind allergy Borat Bruno and the dictator has a new show out with who is America making Sarah Pailin publicly complaining about being duped and Roy more threatening to sue. It's hard to miss.

Speaker 2:          00:19          Is it possible to sign my waterboard? Sure. Thank you. Find the space that, yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:25          but how does Cohen do it? How does he keep getting such high profile people to make fools of themselves on camera? Well, while he may land his bare ass on m and m space or Russell, the occasional fat dude, his brand of comedy is more sophisticated than you might think. No, seriously.

Speaker 2:          00:41          Maybe I'm mad with this dream of becoming a world famous artist just by using my income. Am I?

Speaker 1:          00:50          I think we're all mad and it all has to do with cloud the creepiest con. So come float with us for this wisecrack condition on the philosophy of Sasha Baron Cohen.

And now on the Sasha in case you don't know who Sasha Baron Cohen is, he rose to fame in the late nineties for his brief segments on UK tvs, the 11 o'clock show, which also gave rise to Ricky Gervais'. His sketches were based around a character initially called the Youth Lanka. He was dressed like a stereotypical chaff or a British insult for obnoxious lower class kids who had delusions of being part of the gangster rap lifestyle.

Speaker 2:          01:45          The limbo stains from the house. Is it good sized truck

Speaker 1:          01:50          character transformed into what we now know as allergy allergy started by interviewing British establishment figures with pompous titles who are desperate to seem down with the kids, but predictably this always backfires

Speaker 2:          02:03          perhaps, or they bathed in us as milk.

Speaker 1:          02:07          She often exposed how out of touch those politicians and academics could be.

Speaker 2:          02:11          It's much more democratic. UC The rap scene.

Speaker 1:          02:15          Within a year, he won the British comedy award for best newcomer his other characters bore at, and Bruno were also making appearances at the time and they all seem to have the same kind of finger on the pulse, confrontational satire that improves such a hit with allergy. Sure enough, 20 years or hit movies and a major animation franchise. Later Cohen is back with his patented brand of character comedy in who is America Auggie's. No, they all artificial prosthetics specially designed. They look just like my real aunts, but his style of pissing off suits didn't just appear overnight. Cohen had training from a surprising place in the mid Nineties Cohen, it's ended and elite clown school in Paris called Ecole Phillipe Galley. Yay. All right. It's not technically a clown school. It's a performing art school, but it is run by master clown, Felipe golly eight who was a pupil of famous, my member formers shock McCook who followed in the footsteps of classics and mccloud's like Laurel and hardy, Buster Keaton and Charlie Chaplin. But before you start asking, where am I? Oversized novelty shoes, clowns are more than just red wigs and honky noses. They have a pretty complicated history that can help explain how we landed here.

Speaker 2:          03:24          Just remember to point puppy pistols mouth right at the middle of the bad man. If he has a big fat tummy pointed that

Speaker 1:          03:32          good. Hey, it's fine. Way Back in 16th century Italy, a type of traveling theater developed called commedia Dell'arte that was performed on the back of a wagon by actors in masks, which already seems creepy enough even for clowns. Commedia Dell'arte took the form of sketches and Improv with an elaborate bit of slap stick performed in the middle by a character called the Harlequin. Well, sorta like her. The harlequin wore a checkered costume and acted in silence mostly so the actors didn't have to translate for the different Italian dialects. This section of the performance came to be known as the pantomime. By the 17th century. Pantomimes were a whole show in contained a section called the Harlequin aid, which introduced the character called the clown. The clown was created as a buffoonish companion to the Harlequin. Their physical comedy left a trail of destruction behind them, a kind of humor that we see everywhere around us today. They were also borish and crude Chrisman, Nan's boyfriend and Derek Ima was telman then that is kind of bilingual. How many languages does that mean him speak and the word clown originally meant rustic or peasant, meaning they were used as a depiction of the lowest class in society.

Speaker 2:          04:45          Okay, is my neighbor symptoms. He is barely my ass holes. I get the window from a glass. It wasn't good. The window from a glass.

Speaker 1:          04:53          These broader comedy moments of Cohen's characters certainly seem to live up to this classical definition of a clown, but in those examples, the clown is the one being laughed at. Cohen's humor is unique and that it often turns the tables and gets the audience laughing at say, a Georgia state Rep.

Speaker 2:          05:10          How touch with Webex. I'll catch you going to dropped the gun her, I'll check you.

Speaker 1:          05:14          Well, there's a theatrical tradition to that too. One that is inextricably linked to clowned him, the full building off commedia, Dell'Arte Shakespeare. It's always can shakespeare develop the full character in his place, which was a mix of court, Jester and clown, even occasionally called them clowns and while they were certainly comic relief, there are other main role was to speak truth to power. The fool and Shakespeare tends to hang around the important nobles and in the process of getting the laugh, they often unexpectedly have something profound to say and if they can say whatever, no one else can, it's because everyone discounts them as an idiot. Do you think president trump, he's your friend, do you think he might've had a golden shower? Would surprise me. For example, Shakespeare's comedy 12th night, the character Fesa is often called a wise fool because he sums up the play's themes and gives an honest assessment of the situation when the other characters don't. For instance, when he's asked to sing, instead of just performing the shakespearian equivalent of deaths Pasito, he sings a song that explicitly states the place themes of young love. It's haste and it's follows.

Speaker 1:          06:23          Another important element of the fool is that they're foolish just springs out the stupidity in those around them. In a midsummer night's dream, the full character appropriately called bottom, has his head literally turned into an ass without realizing it. Yeah. Shakespeare wasn't always subtle. This is to make an ass of me. He's then left to wander the forest where he meets the fairy Queen Titanium who under the influence of a love potion falls in love with him, asked hedanol bottom remains unaware of his condition. So entertains titanium is misguided affection, which allows the audience to literally laughed their asses off bottom. Just like allergy or bore at isn't mocking titanium. He's just an innocent fool. It's titanium that makes an ass of herself similar to bottom, making an ass of titanium by being an ass g uses his own ass street to bring out the ass in everyone around him.

Speaker 3:          07:18          Wouldn't it be more better instead of having a vote in age, just saying, all right, if you as go cubes, you can vote. Uh, I, you know, I, I would be willing to try it. And some, a smaller way.

Speaker 1:          07:30          In an early Bruno clip, Cohen interviews some of the coolest, hippest and wealthiest fashion designers at a fashion show, one of whom has produced a line of trailer trash fashion for the catwalk. Yes. Literally like Mugatunes Dera leaked from zoo lander. Bruno asks her about this line of clothes and prompts the stylist pete eight little too honest.

Speaker 4:          07:50          So 10 for Antonio Holmes says this, watch trash trashing queer porter and where to buy as a cloud. I don't think they can afford it.

Speaker 1:          07:59          Cohen is of course aware that they can, asking at an upscale fashion show at poor people can buy the clothes on display is stupid, but this stupidity is just a foil to get them to reveal what Cohen already knows. So you can see how Cohen takes this classical archetype of a clown taught to him by Golly, Aa and brought it up to date. But besides foolishness, the clown can also bring out people's a less than pleasant side too, by incorporating a racial stereotype and nationalism or sexuality. A clown can reveal prejudices better than most. So in four at sings and people sing along, Cohen is baiting people's prejudices by mirroring them or when Bhorat does this,

Speaker 4:          08:47          every single man, woman and child.

Speaker 5:          08:51          Yeah, sure.

Speaker 1:          08:53          It's funny because we know he's being clown, but it's all so depressingly revealing of public opinion during the Iraq war. When Bruno and his partner make out and start undressing in the middle of a cage fight, we see the entire crowd doing this. But if all Cohen is doing is making an ass of people, what's the difference between him and an Internet trolls? Trolls tried to elicit a strong reaction out of their audience. Sure. But they're all so hostile and negative. The cloud, on the other hand, has no malicious intent. They're just stupid. A clown simply gives their targets, enough rope to hang themselves with.

Speaker 2:          09:33          I didn't imply anybody here is racism costs, not I'm racist toward Muslims,

Speaker 1:          09:39          but even then, whatever deeper purpose of clown has, it should always come second to making people laugh.

Speaker 2:          09:45          Obviously the first aim is to be as funny as you can, but you know, occasionally you, you know, we end up uncovering some unpleasant truths.

Speaker 1:          09:52          So why do we think of clowns only as white makeup wearing and poorly sized motor vehicle driving child scares. What we picture when someone says clown today is known as the red cloud, which was invented as a companion to be original white clown. The red clown was created in the 19th century by actors and circus performers like Joseph Per Maldi, Jordahl Fox and Tom belling who obviously weren't funny enough without a red nose. And that's the image that's taken over today, whether it's used as an insult or to scare children. Clowns have an image problem. A lot of that art you Scalia is because we've forgotten what a clown actually is and why clowns like Cohen are so important. A clown isn't defined by his makeup, which has always been a muddle of different influences anyway. Golly, eight once a student has discovered his clown, he no longer announces with his outfit. A clown doesn't need any of that stuff. A clown is innocent. This is what separates a real clown from whatever the hell this is. A clown should be invisible. A clown can slip amongst any group, particularly the people who think that they're powerful or successful.

Speaker 2:          10:57          You want to say big up yourself. We'll trust board boot trust, trust, galley, respect,

Speaker 1:          11:05          because the clown isn't seen as a threat. That's how clowns draw out their qualities. In these same people like selfishness, foolishness, childishness, clumsiness and outright stupidity, which is why someone like Cohen can get Pat Buchanan to admit that.

Speaker 2:          11:21          Is it ever worth fighting a war over sandwiches? Is it ever worth fighting a war? Um, yes. Or this in less than a month, less than a month. A first grader can become a first Grenada

Speaker 1:          11:39          low. Yeah. If you're watching who is America, you're probably cringing along with me as Sasha tears apart. Our current cultural nightmare these days.
