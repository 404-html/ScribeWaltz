Speaker 1:          00:00          This video is brought to you by Wix, one of wise crack, jared again, and today we're talking about the enemy that isn't sure. Humidity has much time. That's right. We're taking a trip back inside the walls and revisiting attack on Titan. Before we get started though, a quick shout out to us

Speaker 1:          00:23          and our first meeting you want attack on Titan. We piece together all the German sounding names in the vague political illusions to say that attack on Titan was a show about a concept in political theory called the friend enemy distinction. Check that video out, but the Tldr is functionally that this guy named Carl Schmidt said that friends and enemies, right foundational division in politics without which some pretty bad stuff would happen, but we mused. What if the show is a critique of Carl Schmitt, who by the way is not a nice man and got caught up with some ad stuff. And the third also, we didn't read the Maga, and today that critique habit as attack on titan is progressed, it became clear that these stark division between enemy and friends, I he tightened and human is a pretty intense fabrication, used to advance a specific agenda.

Speaker 1:          01:12          Seasons two and three, explore what happens when that distinction begins to crumble to, can we just patch up society and go home? Well, not quite. That's because as the show explores, even when the truth is on your side, society has some great defense mechanisms to uphold the status quo. So strap on your odm gear and join us as we go deep on attack on Titan seasons two and three. And as always, spoiled ahead. First up, I want to say thank you to our sponsors over at wix. Wix is the easiest way to create beautiful professional websites for whatever your needs may be. I'm actually trying to get onto the professional voiceover game. So I created a website with wix to present all my voice samples. So check it out. I was creating a website for myself and I wanted a portfolio and cv and I'm a total newbie.

Speaker 1:          02:07          Then I literally started typing and there was already a template for voiceover artists. I picked a style I liked, and within minutes I was dragging and dropping my audio files and Bam. Now I have something I'm confident to send out to potential clients. Establishing yourself as a professional in a new space can be daunting, but I was really surprised by how inviting and easy it was to create a website that makes it look like I know what I'm doing. So if you're looking to up your game before 2019, go to wix.com/wise crack or click the link in the description to start making your free website today and now back to the show. Let's start with a quick recap. Attack on Titan is about the last vestiges of humanity hiding out behind giant walls to avoid naked man eating titles, as you might imagine with giant monsters on the outskirts of your walls are pretty rational. US versus them structure society. This is a pretty high risk lifestyle and sure enough titans breakthrough the outermost wall. From there, things go from dire to downright dystopian and it's up to the scouts, mankind's outright or strikeforce to get under control, but like the city's walls, the stark division between human and tightened doesn't last very long. At the end of season one, the scouts realized that one of their own Erin can shape shift between human and tightened. Also, he might be able to use his tightened power to seal that Pesky hold on the outer wall.

Speaker 2:          03:28          Jonesy and custodian pull customer could come in on Sunday.

Speaker 1:          03:35          In season two, a bunch of titans emerge and trap the scouts in a castle or fellow scout you mirror turns into a titan surprise to rescue them. Apparently everyone is a tightened as bertold and reiner are in fact be colossal and armored tightened respectively. They kidnapped Aaron, but the scouts are able to rescue him and start laying out their plan to fix the wall. Aaron learns he can control nearby titans and we learned that this lady, Krista is actually named Historia, which is very important. Then season three happens. Irwin, the commander of the scouts stages a Kuda to top by turning the people against the nobles. Scouts, Aaron and Historia are kidnapped by his story, his father, the true king broad rice. They escape, but not before rod rice becomes the grossest tightened. To date he attacks the city, but Aaron and Historia kill him. Cementing Historia as a warrior queen, the people can get behind.

Speaker 1:          04:28          Finally, united that people can get back to retaking the outer wall. Okay, now we're all caught up, but what do we make of all that? Well, as we mentioned, attack on Titan has always been about the distinction of being a friend and enemy and regular speak. It's the idea that the easiest way to get society to work together is if they're against someone else. I'll season one showed a whole society built around this principle. Seasons two and three, explore how people empower knowingly manufacturer this false divide. As such, attack on Titan is a show about the flow of information. Each episode includes an interstitial labeled information available for public disclosure, which implies a trove of information not available to the public. Some of that classified information includes the titan inside the wall, brother Nick, a priest of the wall might know something about it, but he gets got by the interior police before we can say too much, and when a young Irwin talks about some of his father's theories on history in public, while let's just say that no one has to worry about waking daddy anymore.

Speaker 1:          05:28          Another critical secret is the fact that some of these psycho killer titans are in fact just shape shifting people. Erin is the first example we meet, but at the end of season one, we see any shape shift and in season two, Yummier Reiner and bertold all transform. We even see a town where most of the population has changed into titans. Diego, of course, this is a critical secret and one, the nobles will do anything to keep under wraps. That's just the tip of the conspiratorial iceberg. Behind the already repressive government. There's an even more autocratic system that exists in the shadows. It turns out that the king we thought was in charge is just a figurehead. Instead, the city is ruled by the rice family currently rod and his Air Storia who have the royal blood necessary to control the powers of the founding. Tighten these two, these Jewish goodwill tonight to shin.

Speaker 1:          06:24          The huc sudden powers like changing the memory of the citizens and even creating the walls at old sun juvenile. No chicana down. All of that is happening behind the scenes determining the fate of the people who have no idea it even exists. The nobles go to great lengths to keep the secret government secret. This includes orchestrating a series of attacks with the dual goals of kidnapping, Aaron and Historia for the sake of broad Rice's plan and framing the scouts for acting against humanities interests. They'll go, go, go, go, and now you're calling. Let me then Joseph Heron on the auto. Cool. Why frame the scouts? Because between seeing several different people turn into titans, they realize that the founding myth of their society, that titans are unthinking people. Eaters is in fact a lie, nor does anyone bothered to mention the role titans played in constructing the walls that defined the world for most of humanity.

Speaker 1:          07:26          God, almost every choice the show makes is premised on the withholding or discovery of information, Vanilla data that Ada, Ada will, and I have a dovetail Shinju. That idea is so central to the show. It's embedded into the narrative structure. Attack on Titan is a mystery box show where the primary driving force, the narrative is moving from one secret to the next rather than moving along narrative arcs. It's a difficult balance, but so far the show has pulled it off by putting the audience in the scouts shoes just as Aaron and Co have to decide who to trust and what to believe. So do we. As we watch, the more we learn, the more we understand, but the more questions we have and same with the scouts, but this doesn't mean people are kept totally in the dark. Rather the information people do get is designed to lead them to conclusions that support the system as is key to that end. There is a newspaper that provides information to the population. Unfortunately the only report what the interior police tell them they should to old companion.

Speaker 1:          08:32          This process of giving people enough information that they don't bother to question the structure, providing it or the world they live in is described by scholar Hamid Dabashi as epistemic and docmosis were older models of government, assumed the lower classes were unthinking, illiterate, idiots who wouldn't even know what to do with the truth. Dabashi argues that power can be solidified by providing bad information to the thinking and literate people with the world, the boss. She explains that this is information to consume, not questioned for the more. It's not meant to generate a coherent body of knowledge, but is instead single serving meant to induce action for a specific event and attack on Titan. We see this in the form of state propaganda and city newspapers. They give people enough information that they feel like they're making decisions when instead they're being manipulated. Now, while in the real world, this kind of epistemic in Moses generates new knowledge on demand for whatever benefits those in power want on a given day.

Speaker 1:          09:30          It has a pretty singular purpose and attack on Titan to maintain the myth of the Titan as outsider monster. That story enables those in power to justify almost any action in the name of defending the people from the monsters outside the walls, actions like rationing food, limiting people's movements in a mule non pod, more you get, and even attempting to execute Irwin who was a goddamn hero, but why lie about the titans in the first place? Well, it varies from character to character, but there are two main reasons, power and belief, as for power. The city with a three wall designed to protect against Titan attacks also happens to be based on a strict class structure that enables the nobles, cushy lifestyle. They worked to perpetuate a stratified city suffering for resource shortages and the occasional naked giant incident because it's that status quo that keeps them in mansions and fancy robes. When Irwin orchestrates a false alarm about a titan attack, the nobles don't hesitate to bar refugees from the inner wall. Saving notion. Don't. No sorry, used usage job fuck domino's.

Speaker 1:          10:41          Here's the deal. In this moment, we see that their interest in the system has nothing to do with protecting the people. It's all about protecting themselves without the myths that control society. Someone might get the thinking that having a bunch of disconnected, rich dudes in charge might be a bad idea. Nice. You got stuck out to them with data that Missoula Udi customers a good nomi doesn't. The other more complicated reason is belief. This idea is most clearly manifested in the character of rod rice. Rice sincerely believes that the only way to protect the people is to use the power of the founding titan.

Speaker 3:          11:19          Gluten will come in or she'll take decent Olga children. Issue started to sick I Dakota.so don't sweat it, Dave,

Speaker 1:          11:33          even if that means wiping people's minds in having his daughter eat her friend to become a titan herself of all those fancy powers court on Tuesday to do connect to Janina. The dosing can be production. That power is so crucial to maintaining the status quo. That rice things. There's no price too high to pay for it, even his own daughter. Thus when she rescues Aaron, he takes the serum himself to try and inherit the power, but it goes awry and he almost kills everyone. What makes this dynamic extra complicated is rod didn't always believe this as a younger man, he and his brother Yuri wanted to destroy all the titans, but when you're a gained the founding titans power, he changed his mind and concluded that only the city could protect them, no matter the motivation. The problem with this heifers, Elos way of thinking is that it turns all political questions into ethical questions

Speaker 4:          12:25          and you come in with untitled or take much

Speaker 1:          12:36          for rod rice, whether he's trying to destroy all the titans or maintaining the myth of the Titan. The stakes are the existence of humanity theory. Strong, tall move explains that when politics become a referendum on ethics, beat politics part ceases to exist in favor of a battle between us and them. The process is simple and attack on Titan. The status quo is set up as the only way to protect humanity from the titans. That means anyone opposed to the system represents an existential threat

Speaker 4:          13:05          lighter. That's what I wanted that Joseph into that

Speaker 1:          13:10          and thus they're evil and when it comes to evil, there's no reasoning with it. The only option is to fight. For instance, when the city turns on the scouts, it's because these former heroes put society in danger by questioning dogma, so the scouts need to be destroyed. The ultimate existential threats and ethical enemy according to the fat cats in this district is the titans. Of course, we know that's not entirely true. After the scouts discover Connie's village to be empty, they realized that many of the people, they're turned into titans including Connie's mother, but that doesn't matter in the face of an ethnicized politics. When some people or titans are determined to be an existential threat, the idea of understanding them goes out the window. Instead, it's time to grab the swords and sliced some vital areas. The titans exist as threats to justify the status quo and things to destroy as a gesture towards safety.

Speaker 1:          14:06          That dynamic is maintained by the control of information, of course, but that monopoly starts to come apart on the personal level. Characters are constantly forced to choose between promises they made to friends or themselves and the broader life fueled social obligations. Some characters have no issue rejecting the morals provided by society in the name of their own beliefs. For instance, Historia is unconditionally loyalty Humira, even though she's a type at the same time. Erin is driven almost entirely by the hatred of titans. Kelsey, oh, he standing. Others are torn between these obligations constantly like the tightened serving in the scouts. Birch hold, Reiner and humira vertical and reiner loved their fellow soldiers, but are also bound to their duty as warriors. They're willing to capture Aaron, but at the same time they do end up letting him go. Then they ended up with the beast heightened setting a trap for Aaron and the scouse Xhosa tools in the tool.

Speaker 1:          15:07          Cool. Cool. Damn up to Dale Scott or Kudos. They are pulled in two directions at once, constantly switching between the two. Of course, nothing in attack on Titan is simple. As the show was saying, more than sometimes the rules of society conflict with personal commitment they don't need. Instead, attack on Titan makes it clear that as the social structure loses legitimacy, whether through its failure to protect the people or it's myths crumbling, social bonds grow as the scouts discover the truth, their connection solidify to the point of trumping their societal obligation. That's why they go to rescue Aaron and Historia even as society turns against them. Perhaps no other moment illustrates this point better than Aaron and history is confrontation in the cave rod rice has aaron chained up and offers his story of the tightened serum. If she takes it, she will transform, eat her friend Aaron and become the founding tightened that rod rice believes the city needs. Aaron wants her to do it. He thinks if she eats him, she'll be able to not only protect the people, but kill the titans. Aaron spouts the city's myths. Set the story up to convince her secretary to hostile.

Speaker 1:          16:30          Got Kitchen. Let's cut. Pick you talk, but she's not buying it. She doesn't believe any of the social myths anymore, not just because she knows the truth of the system.

Speaker 5:          16:44          Josie, you got it,

Speaker 1:          16:52          but she also sees the moral truth. Any social arrangement that puts her in opposition to her best friend new mirror is inherently wrong to her. Okay. Want me to $90 so she rejects rob's plan, smashes the vial and freeze. Aaron. Aaron is arguing for the status quo while historian believes in the possibility of a better different world. These are the real stakes of personal obligation versus the ethics provided by society. Personal ethics want to protect the values of the people while social ethics are designed to sustain the status quo. Attack on Titan seasons two and three. Point two. The dire fact that history can be used as a tool to tell the story that ends in the status quo. That's why it's so important that the founding titans powers include the ability to wipe the memory of the population by creating a history that fits their needs.

Speaker 1:          17:51          The people in charge are able to maintain persistent control of the population and give them ethical priorities that matched the goals of the system and attack on Titan society is sustained by myths. The powers that be will do anything to protect those stories and justify the status quo against the possibility of any other social model. Gutted. Dylan. Cut It on the keynote. Was she touching? Okay. Kendig, Olivia. So data that shows that includes killing titans even if they aren't monsters after all, but rather people and during a terrible fate, anything is justified if it means keeping society as it is intact. So what do you think wise? Crack his attack on Titan. A lesson on how power works or is there something we missed?
