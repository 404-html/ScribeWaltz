Speaker 1:          00:02          Hey, wise, crack jared again. Today we're talking about a film that everyone's loving and nobody's watching. Blade runner 20, 49. The central question, the original blade runner poses is what makes us human. The cul continues to meditate on the importance of this question, but instead of retreading the same brown, it proposes something new that is essential to our humanity and how does it do this with holographic? Why foods and weird avant garde literature. Welcome list wise, crack quick. Take our blade runner. 20, 49. Major spoilers ahead. First, a recap. After the events of the original blade runner, the world freaked out and banned the production of replicants. However, tensions eventually cool and a new company starts to produce replicants that to quote Rick Sanchez has zero chance of going blade runner 20, 49 follows k, a replicant hunting blade runner and replicant himself. He discovers the skeleton of a replicant that shows signs of having given birth, which should be impossible.

Speaker 1:          00:59          K sent in search of the trial replicant and discovers the father is a certain Mr Decker, informed by a childhood memory case, suspects that he is deckards miracle child that would start the replicant revolution except ease, not the memory was implanted by deckards real daughter, confined the reunites with her mean old ad. The 1982 classic largely reflects on how attachment to memories both for mankind and replicants defines our humanity replicants, recite poetry and ask all the philosophical questions while we're shown debase humans who are all drunk and disease. All this serves to further blur the distinction between human and replicant. Twenty, 49 explores this fuzzy, replicant human distinction in another way with intimacy and physical connection or rather the lack of it. The only real relationship k experiences is with his holographic girlfriend. Joy K tries to make their relationship more real by uploading her to a portable projector, allowing her to free roam in one of the weirder scenes, joy projects her image onto a prostitute so they can physically touch.

Speaker 1:          02:06          The desire for intimacy is subtly implanted all throughout the film. Neander wallace, the creator of the new replicants, must feel and touch everything due to his blindness. Deckards daughter is locked in an isolation chamber and unable to touch the holograms that keep her entertained. There's also a recurring motif of feeling precipitation, as I'll call it. Joy going outside for the first time reaches out to feel the rain, but it goes right through her replicants wear gloves all throughout the film until k removes his own to feel the touch of falling snow earlier. Case outstretched hand is covered in bees, although to be honest, I'm a little less sure about what the bees represent. We also see a group of orphans collectively touch k when he shows up to find the replicant. Child and Hologram Elvis sings, take my hand from his song, can't help falling in love after deckerd in KP, the hell out of each other.

Speaker 1:          02:58          The film's shot shows decker trying to touch his daughter, but they're obstructed by a glass wall. Through this, the importance of touch and connection is seen as innately human. The second way, 20, 49 explores the human replicant distinction is in its exploration of how memory builds our personal narrative and how fallible that is. See, this is really interesting because whereas the original blade runner showed replicants making claims to humanity with memories. 20, 49 goes further. Implying memories alone aren't enough. You might remember the bizarre post-trauma stress test k has to go through twice. He sits in a barren room where a disembodied voice keeps saying stuff about a system of cells while k responds with words like interlinked cells and dreadfully. This test has ripped straight from Vladimir Nabokov, book Pale Fire. The full excerpt is a system of cells interlinked within cells, interlinked within cells, interlinked within one step and dreadfully distinct against the dark.

Speaker 1:          03:55          A Tall White Fountain played later. We actually see Pale fire in k's apartment. Enjoy, asked him to read it. The premise of Pale fire is essentially that you've got a poem by a fictional author being analyzed in the footnotes by a fictional commentator. It's a book about a commentary about a poem. Essentially books, the whole cells interlinked. Passage details are fictional poet. Having a heart attack and seeing a vision of a tall white fountain. Later in the poem he reads about someone else having a near death experience and seeing the same white fountain convinced that this shared vision proves the existence of an afterlife. The poet investigates further only to discover the line was a misprint and the person actually said White Mountain sensing a theme here. These narratives that we build around objects and memories is at the heart of 20, 49 discussion on what makes a human case memory of a wooden horse leads him to believe that he is this miracle child, but surprise he isn't.

Speaker 1:          04:58          They're not his memories, their implants. Just as the fictional poet of Pale fires, revelation is shattered after realizing the white fountain was a misprint. Kay's revelation is shattered after realizing beat miss imprint of a memory, and this is where the themes of intimacy and memory combined when he's given the choice to help the resistance by killing deckerd, he refuses. Instead of trusting his memories, he puts his faith in the intimacy and physical connection he yearns for. Thus, he lets this not memory guide him to his decision to reunite deckerd and his daughter and just like the original blade runner, a replicant disobeys, his programming to save a life, thus achieving meaning and maybe even a soul. There is so much more we could say about the thematic connections between 20, 49 and pale fire like parental loss, the need for memorial or even just the line father time.

Speaker 1:          05:53          All gray and bent emerged with is uneasy dog, which sounds lot like deckerd and his furry companion plus what's up with all the water imagery, the cell imagery there a lot more to unpack here, so let us know what you think in the comments and maybe we'll do an earthling cinema or a true philosophy up until next time.
