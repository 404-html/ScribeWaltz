Speaker 1:          00:00          This episode is brought to you by even cero watches. What's up guys? Jared here, if you've been following South Park and our South Park podcast perspect our authortalk, you've probably noticed that the show feels a little different these days. Last season South Park often explored our reactions, the current events, especially outrage and despair. And while that's still front and center, this season hones in on a different feeling resignation. So far south park has been showing how the modern world has overwhelmed, devastated and just exhausted us. So let's get super depressed about the world in this wise crack. Quick take on the first four episodes of South Park season 22 and is always spoilers ahead. But first a quick recap of the season. So far in episode one, Sharon freaks out about the daily school shootings at South Park elementary

Speaker 2:          00:59          chosen were shot. They were killed at a school where they were supposed to be

Speaker 1:          01:04          [inaudible]. No one else seems to care. Uh Huh. What else is going on? Meanwhile, Cartman is Jessica Jonesing to investigate these seemingly impossible claim. That token hasn't seen Black Panther in episode two. Father Maxi. Now the butts of a plethora of pedophile jokes leaves his post in a crisis of faith only to find hope with butters. Now of course, a priest being best friends with the kid is a bad look and the archdiocese mistakenly sends out a cleanup crew to take care of the issue. Episode Three C's, south parks, resident Christmas mass, Scott lose his position after a series of ambient fueled tweets. While episode four takes the Marsh family from South Park to a Colorado weed farm or randy goes toe to toe with big vape. So what do all these episodes have? Income? A few things, but we're going to start with maybe the biggest sensitization. Don't understand South Park's commentary on desensitization.

Speaker 1:          01:57          We have to understand the way the media contributes to an alters collective grief scholars, Arthur and joan climb and describe the way in which images of suffering are appropriated to appeal emotionally and morally to certain audiences and how these images have become extremely important to the media. The problem, however, is that aside from just reporting on tragic events, the media commercializes victims who are taken up into processes of global marketing and business competition, when experiences turned into commodities that are leveraged by mainstream or social media to give us all the fields, something strange happens. The result is that in the end we become numb to the suffering of others. South Park is telling us something. We already know that it's easy to be impassioned about a thing at first, but it's equally easy to burn out. In episode one, we see southpark beset with a plague of school shootings during which most behave with a colt nonchalance. Well, I got this one. Nobody seems to give a shit except Sharon

Speaker 3:          03:00          series. Did you not hear what your child said? Kids died at his school

Speaker 1:          03:06          instead of listening to her, please to think of the children, Randy and the rest of south park believe the real issue is that she's on her period or worse entering menopause. You see Mr. Marsh, menopause is almost like a super period and it's been known to last for up to two years. Oh by God and from their episodes three and four open with gunshots at South Park elementary before panning over to tell the more pressing story. Desensitization is so rampant. The citizens of south park aren't even outraged about Catholic priests molesting children. They've simply resigned to making jokes about it.

Speaker 3:          03:46          The great one, Nelson Salvation in a little boy's mouth. I'm going to post that one for sure.

Speaker 1:          03:50          Even when his son is theoretically in danger. Randy can help but crack jokes and post them on social media,

Speaker 3:          03:57          but where would prisco this late at night to a midnight sale at boys Rs. What'd she say? She sat too. I midnight sale at buys our eyes. Got It. Can I pose that?

Speaker 1:          04:08          We see here how social media makes it that much easier to become desensitized by berating us with images and ideas of suffering. Even providing an incentive to think of these things as jokes or potential posts rather than serious events. In all these cases, no one even tries to make the world any better. They're too busy just trying to bear the nightmare world they're living in. So how can these horrible things be fixed? If everyone has become indifferent, to be blunt, they can't. The people just become exhausted and eventually submit. No matter how much sense Sharon makes the townspeople write her off and eventually she becomes comfortably numb, barely reacting. When her son stand becomes the latest victim in a school shooting. It's not the end of the world. Maxis quest to become a better priest ends the same way. He rejects the churches institutional coverup of the kid touching epidemic and slaughters the clean up crew with their own home boney, but he's also accepted that he can't save the church, nor can he expect the adults to change their behavior. All he can do his vow to do the right thing. As an individual, it looks like there's not much choice but to go with the flow and accept the world as given as horrible as it is, which is a lesson kyle learns the hard way, courtesy of his good friend Mr Hankey, when everyone's favorite Christmas poo finds himself in trouble for taking ambien and tweeting things like

Speaker 3:          05:32          the city council members are a bunch of pussy licking is llamas.

Speaker 1:          05:36          Mr Hankey not only refuses to admit he did anything wrong, he continues to act like an asshole. Mr Hankey looks for help clearing his name, but no one will help him because as Gerald says,

Speaker 3:          05:47          I learned a long time ago that if you defend poop, you get stained.

Speaker 1:          05:51          Finally, Mr Hankey finds hope in Kyle who vows to stick by his friend. Meanwhile, strong woman gives birth to a quintuplet of PC babies who react negatively to any violations of political correctness. X gives me,

Speaker 4:          06:04          sorry I until food aisle.

Speaker 1:          06:08          The babies and the Hanky collide when the Christmas Poo puts on an early Christmas celebration and the baby's cry at even the most benign of holiday. Well wishes Mr Hankey goes off the rails and Kyle's attempts to calm the situation. Leaves him stained both literally and metaphorically. Yeah, like in the end, Heil has to give up and stop defending his friend because if he doesn't, he'll get ostracized to they're gone.

Speaker 4:          06:39          You went then to erase me too. It turns out Cartherin was right. I want to stand by my friend. Let's see how that goes for you in 28

Speaker 1:          06:48          so what happens when you want to fight back against an exhausting, infuriating world when you want to just make things better or steep? The pressures of modern life aside from the gunshots in the intro episode four starts very differently than the others. Instead of being desensitized, we see randy finally get riled up after three episodes of handwaving the crises around him. What possibly moves randy, just take action. A picture of a dog's butthole.

Speaker 3:          07:16          Seriously. Dog's butt hole. That's what we're doing now. Huh?

Speaker 1:          07:21          From there, he decides to abandoned South Park and move on up to Colorado bar where he can live a life of tegrity there he starts growing weed but refuses to participate in the progress promised by executives at big vape there by pitting his tegrity against their concepts of progress. Your Mommy teach you. It doesn't pay to mess with progress. Yeah, she taught Ms. Dot. Mouse too. If you're going to fight for your tegrity, don't forget to bring it down. Of course, this is funny because randy really has no tegrity to speak of. His home spun style doesn't come from growing up on a farm or being born into the life. It's just a random choice. A guy in a small town made his accent is a clear expectation that he picks up and drops on a whim.

Speaker 3:          08:08          Yeah, whatever all you're doing is blowing smoke. Sorry, Freudian

Speaker 1:          08:12          deep. What happened to your accent? He even uses the language of Tegrity as an advertising device at the end of the episode made with a little color out of integrity. In the end, his tegrity nonsense is made of the same stuff as the claims to progress that carbon and the vape executive make. You can be a part of progress or you can get run over by it. Just as tegrity is a costume randy puts on to sell the jungle Kush progress is just an advertising device. It's an excuse to move a product with flavors that target children

Speaker 4:          08:43          relax, trust, and can we based on price

Speaker 1:          08:48          and south park even the attempts to heal such an exhausting world, whether through progress or integrity are totally self and foolish, but what does tegrity even mean while the hero's try to hash it out.
