Speaker 1:          00:00          What's up guys? Paddling season continues out wise crack. So last month we piled it a show called the film tourist. It was on the wolf of Wall Street. If you haven't seen that one yet, be sure to check it out. This is the second episode in that series. This one is on the shining. Before we get to it, this video is sponsored by movie, a curated online cinema streaming exceptional films from around the globe so you can get your 30 day free trial at movie.com/wise crack and along with the show Stanley Kubrick's, the shining or the world's most persuasive argument for taking the stairs. This movie scares the shit out of everyone,

Speaker 2:          00:39          but why all this for you there

Speaker 1:          00:45          it's hard to say. What exactly is wrong with this place is haunted. Is it all in their heads? Is it possessed by the Devil Tony? Something about an Indian burial ground. They located on an Indian burial ground. Where else? A lot of traditional horror gives us an easy to understand reason to shirt dark pants. The shining deliberately avoids an easily describable premise and this is part of what makes it so damn horrifying. It deprives us of logical explanation. Koop rick accomplishes this in a variety of ways, but I'm here at the overlook hotel to talk about one of the most surprisingly simple perspective. One of the most effective ways to create a stronger sense of perspective is through the way it's shot is framed and sequenced. See, a shot can be objective, subjective, or fall somewhere in between. Purely objective shots. Show us a scene as it is a God's eye point of view as a poor eavesdropping or watching a play.

Speaker 1:          01:44          Subjective ankles directly insert us into the action showing the view from just beside or behind a character. Purely subjective shots take us directly into the eyes of a character. Usually by showing their face first followed by their visual perspective or emotional experience can also invite us to question what we're seeing like an unreliable narrator in literature. In this scene we see a shot up Danny's face that a cut to the girls. Then Danny's face again with this simple sequence of shots were being shown. The events through Danny's mind. Let's see how cooper it takes this basic principle perspective to create an indescribable supernatural feeling.

Speaker 1:          02:29          Consider the famous scene of Danny riding his tricycle through the hotel's winding corridors and you give me some skin. All right. Using a state of the art piece of equipment for the time who brick is able to achieve supernaturally smooth movements. To follow Danny showing us the hotel from a child's point of view. We followed danny any traditional subjective shot that emphasizes his experience navigating a large maze like hotel, but we don't follow him perfectly. Watch how the camera lingers after he's left frame and then hurries to catch up with him. One film scholar calls this the wandering camera because the camera ambles along like it's own sentient being or here and imagined monster stocking danny through the halls. This grates the sense the hotel is alive and watching Danny through his vacation. When the twins show up, we move more intimately into a subjective sequence of Danny's pov flashing between his bloody visions.

Speaker 1:          03:27          Danny covers his eyes, looks again, and now they're gone. So perhaps the girls are just in his head by starting with Danny's point of view as we follow him, but then shifting to a possible camera monsters point of view and then back to Danny's may be unreliable own vision. The film undermines our ability to interpret the events in front of us whose point of view is this, Dan? He's the hotel, some demon that, let's consider Jack is all this creepy stuff in his head too. Did someone just spike the water with Lsd in this otherwise normal hotel? Take this scene in the apparently empty gold ballroom. In this scene, we go from a closeup of Jack as a seemingly addresses an invisible being, the reveal shot of Lloyd. This subjective sequencing of shots could suggest that Jack is hallucinating and just when we're sure that this is all a subjective delusion, kubrick moves the camera backward over his shoulder, taking the shot from his direct point of view to a more objective one.

Speaker 1:          04:34          From there, Kubrick gives the scene and objective reality by showing both characters in a shot together, Lloyd's the real deal. We think until Wendy shows up and the ballrooms suddenly empty and we're left totally confused and creeped hours, so what's going on? We don't know. And the camera work makes sure we'll never find out. Now at times Jack's point of view even seems to merge with that of the imagine Predator that was following Danny in this shot. Jack's view looking down on the model hedge maze, Glen's into an aerial view of his family wandering through the actual hedges. This effect happens again as he chases Danny in the final scene. See how the same kind of shot that used to be stuffing Danny through the halls has now mingled with Jack's point of view. Further confounding the various supernatural elements of the film. We're not using point of view to screw with reality.

Speaker 1:          05:29          Kubrick also uses our perception of physical space to creep us out. How do you make a huge otherwise normal hotel and presented as a claustrophobic nightmare? Kubrick is famous for what is called one point perspective, which adds to the cramped field with one point perspective. Near perfect symmetry draws the audience's eye to the one vanishing point at the center of the frame, giving this sensation that we're being drawn into the shot, which is further enhanced by the tracking shot inward. It feels uneasy like the walls are collapsing inwards. That's why even though the overlook hotel seems like a spacious setting, we feel increasingly cramped as the movie goes on, almost like claustrophobic rear, which can occur when people are shunning together over long periods of time by juxtaposing large spaces with much smaller ones, Kubrick is able to get the viewer to feel really claustrophobic. This starts with the opening shot of the mountain, which cuts to the shot of the family clown car style. Then we moved from the large sweeping hotel lobby to the Torrance is small hotel corridors. While the hotel may be large, the torrance is are trapped and increasingly smaller spaces within it.

Speaker 1:          06:44          Eventually Jack ends up locked in a fridge. Danny escapes through a tiny window and nobody has any elbow room. Through these tricks and perspective. Stanley Kubrick is able to add a layer of creepiness that if aid simple description, and that's why the shining is so great and why film nerds will continue to talk about it for years to come. There's so much more to talk about in the shining. So if you liked this video, let us know if you want us to do another. And as always, thanks for watching peace. All right guys, hope you enjoy that.
