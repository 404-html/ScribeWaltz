Speaker 1:          00:00          This video is brought to you by Skillshare,

Speaker 1:          00:06          a wise crack. Jared, again, are you one of the million spending your evenings as a digital dark elf, shotgunning strangers in the world's most popular video game, or if not, are you wondering why everyone won't shut up about the fluorescent cartoon version of Pub g? Whether you're a fortnight fan or not, you might have a more pressing question. How the hell was this free game making billions of dollars? You might think you know the answer, but here's something you might not have considered for night, isn't making money in spite of the fact that it's free. It's making money because it's free. Also, it's stupendous. Success might aluminate one of the fundamental tenants of the modern economy, so climb off your Air Force One and button up your virtual bridges as we break down the economics of fortnight. For those of you living under a pixelated rock fortnight is a battle royale style shooter where you hunger games or weighted the finale in hopes of being the last cat standing.

Speaker 1:          00:56          You can also play in squads or 50 slash 50. It sets itself apart from the other battle royale games with it's more colorful and cartoonish style and the ability to build things like a murderous minecraft. Oh, and also everything is free. The game is free to download. The weapons are free and you don't even need an inexpensive console. Since you can play online on a potato. This essentially makes the game available to everyone with access to a computer, but fortnights producer, epic games is making staggering amounts of money. In May of this year alone, they made $318,000,000. That's enough for Elon musk to launch five rockets to space. In other words, it's a ton. Not surprisingly fortnight, makes its money on in game purchases. Usually it's in game currency vbox. We're going to assume the V stands for virtual, not vapid, vacant or vacuous because what does this virtual cash gets you? Bad ass weaponry to slay your foes or super powerful armor to protect you from the bad men trying to teabag you. Nope. You know what? You can buy dances and shiny things, functionless armor and different characters. In fact, you can buy all the bad ass, silly or individualized you want, but it's all purely cosmetic. We all know lots of games manipulate us into buying things.

Speaker 2:          02:11          It pays the payer with a skimper game loop. Use Lots of flashing into things and condiments to make the player feel good about themselves. Train the players to spend your currency. Offer the payers away to spend real currency for your picker, and so they'll forget that are spending money and make the game about waiting, but let the player base, not the wheat. It's a surefire way to make lots of money.

Speaker 1:          02:31          That's not news, but fortnight is different than other free to play games where you can buy stuff that actually you know helps you in those games. Free to play is essentially paid when why? Wait 20 hours for your fortress to upgrade. If you can speed it up for ninety nine cents, but fortnight insists on equal access to all players. Even if you suck,

Speaker 2:          02:51          oh my God, okay, this is that. This is better than another.

Speaker 3:          02:59          Really, dude,

Speaker 1:          03:02          making sure that none of the purchases actually give you any advantage, which even if you hate the game is pretty cool, so why do people buy this stuff? That's only function is cosmetic, but we all just idiots trying real hard to turn reality into an episode of Black Mirror. Well, laugh all you want, but our fortnights show boaters are actually just doing something that we all do, whether we like to admit it or not. It's basically just the logic on which our whole economy is built to understand why people want to spend their money on books just to spend those bucks. I'm a pick that's shaped like a baseball bat. We need to hop on a battle bus and transport ourselves to the year 18, 99. Back then most economists were trying to figure out how the markets worked based on how useful goods were, how much labor went into making them, and of course the supply and demand of those items.

Speaker 1:          03:49          Economists essentially believed people would rationally ordered their purchases based on need. You buy bread because it feeds you coats, because they keep you warm at second, but then they looked at how the wealthy were spending their money and thought what it turns out. People were buying the 19th century equivalent of bunny brawler or ginger gunner skins except probably filthy engaged you smallpox or something. Then along came economist and sociologist Thorstein veblen tomato discovery. That might seem obvious today for Veblen. You can explain these irrational purchases by recognizing that people don't just purchase for utility. They also purchase basically just to be cool. You might call this the snob factor and economics, but he gave it a different name. Conspicuous consumption Bebo, and recognize that people purchased certain goods and services in order to publicly flex their wealth and what did veblen observed the wealthy doing to show us their Mad Moolah? The ceremonial differentiation of the dietary basically really, really expensive. Boone's along with servants, huge houses and cars, all the poor had to get by on bread and water. The ability to consume and even waste set the wealthy apart because what says, I'm special more than literally throwing or drinking away your cash or in a more metaphorical sense, stealing your mom's credit card to spend hundreds of dollars on viva.

Speaker 3:          05:09          You have spent a bunch of panels on playstation. I can't believe you have done this. Okay, you've done this before.

Speaker 1:          05:16          Without this conspicuous consumption, our modern economies might not even exist if the economy just fed us, clothed us, housed us, and gave us medical care and all the today, the economy would grind to a halt for companies that always need to increase their profits. How do you squeeze a few more dollars out of a coat? Well, you slap a designer's name on it or you jack up the price. To attract those obsessed with status fortnight is maybe one of the most impressive examples of the digitization of conspicuous consumption. You can set yourself apart. Irl is you spend hundreds of hours playing video games. Nobody can see your sweet cakes or vineyard bind swag and when all eyes are on you, once you've made it to the last two, don't you want to leave an impression, but for night does more than just scratch a digital age for behavior.

Speaker 1:          06:03          We see everywhere around us in fashion and cars and houses because it takes this idea of conspicuous consumption and gamifies it. Mobile Games have the benefit of a massive piles of data which allow them to optimize your spending night employees. These techniques which are now common on ecommerce sites and mobile games like limited time offers with countdown clocks. That really reminds you how much you'll regret. Not taking advantage of this deal in the next 13 hours, but what sets fortnight apart is its babbled pash structure. Let me explain. So if you're a regular player, each season you can level up up to 100 times getting the occasional skin glider tag or now toy, but it's not every level and as you a free player, get the seat. Oh Man. Four levels. I'll look like the red skull crossed with ne more the submariner, but you'll also see side by side all the things you're missing, vbox and XP bonuses and costumes.

Speaker 1:          06:57          You get the idea and at the bottom there's a nice little reminder that if you spend 10 bucks on the battle pass, you could unlock all these things you've already earned, whereas some games might offer loot boxes to manipulate you like a casino drawing you in with a dopamine hit from the luck of the draw fortnight draws you in with pure conspicuous consumption. Everyone else with a series of ebooks is going to have this emote. Do you really want to be the lead without it, and of course you can earn vbox by playing the game and completing challenges, but that'll just take too much time and set you apart as the poor kid, but you might be thinking conspicuous consumption is for the rich or at least little tay.

Speaker 4:          07:35          I don't even have a park.

Speaker 1:          07:41          People dropping money on fortnite aren't necessarily loaded well for veblen. Just because conspicuous consumption starts with the rich doesn't mean it ends there. If the rich want to show how important they are with the things they own, the poor want to escape the stigma of poverty by appearing rich, and then once the poor have successfully emulated the rich, the rich need to buy more equally useless things to again distinguish themselves. Veblen called this depressing cycle of economic epn waving pecuniary emulation. In this way, fortnights battle pat system works a lot like fashion magazines. Anyone can afford to peruse the pages to see what high society is wearing, even if they can't afford the clothing itself, but that's okay. In fact, it's the point you want the audience as large as possible so that everyone regardless of well can spot your $50,000 and this is how fortnight makes money by playing on our desire to meet at least as cool but preferably cooler than everyone else.

Speaker 1:          08:39          What better way to earn money than my making a game free to everyone so that nobody feels left out, but then providing incentive for folks to pay to demonstrate their awesomeness. Like I said, the game isn't making boucoup bucks despite the fact that it's free. It's making money because it's free and does it work? Let's look at some stats. In a survey of a thousand fortnight players, 68 point eight percent had spent an average of $85 on the game. All the bids on cosmetic stuff. Why? Because it's all about keeping up with the Kardashians, so it's four nine really doing anything we don't already experienced in our analog lives, not really. They've just found the shiny new digital arena in which we all want to be liked and feel special, so free or not, we're totally by now.
