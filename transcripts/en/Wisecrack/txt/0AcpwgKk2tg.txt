Speaker 1:          00:10          He only was removed from office or resigned from office a few months ago, a formidable prime minister and the formidable politician, and I suspect the Labour Party will regret removing men,

Speaker 2:          00:28          a very middle class Britain

Speaker 1:          00:32          with a w taken over a very strong economy and he'd left the same strong economy. He made some genuinely very brilliant reforms and his record will bear watching what has saddened, uh, what blocked that record or harm it is Iraq. The fact that he was so willing to look to some of us just fall in line with President Bush, I think Margaret Thatcher would have stood up to President Bush and said so far and no further. And if you take away Iraq, which you can't from the legacy, uh, it's a very impressive premiership, but he will be settled historically. He will be saddled with Iraq.
