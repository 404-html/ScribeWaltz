Speaker 1:          00:04          Hey guys finally got a haircut. Jared here, after 14 years of patiently waiting, we finally got to see the incredibles two and it pretty much shattered all the predictions we made on our movie. Podcasts showed me the meaning. Now as the movie, good. Yes, well, we expected that, but what surprised us is just how thoughtful the film is and it all has to do with the films villain screen slaver not only to screen slaver Dole out some majorly relevant commentary on the effects of our culture's obsession with screens, but her presence Mike just make the incredibles two the most subversive superhero movie ever made. So welcome to this wisecrack quick take on the incredibles two and watch out a monster amount of spoilers ahead, but as always, first a quick recap. Helen gets recruited by media mogul, Winston Devers, new PR campaign is goal change the public face of supers in order to reform their image and eventually changed the laws that outlawed them.

Speaker 1:          00:59          Meanwhile, Mr incredible has to take over parenting duties, which means helping violet through her boy drama and trying to contain Jack. Jack's mind boggling new powers as the PR blitz kicks off, Helen's job quickly takes her face to face with screen slaver who literally uses computers and television screens to control people like a Jedi mind trick with a film degree. Here's the fundamental theme at the core of the films conflict that in the digital age perception has supplanted reality. Early on, Winston introduces us to this idea when he explains the real reason that superheroes were outlawed. Public perception was against them because people associated superheroes with the crime scenes they superhero dad. He argues that in order to change the law, first we need to change people's perceptions about superheroes. Essentially Winston's pitch is that the image of supers as communicated by the media is more real than their lived experience.

Speaker 1:          01:53          Thus, Winston thinks that changing the public perception of supers rather than changing any of their actual deeds is essential to getting the ban lifted. So his plan is to create a specially curated reality of supers to be consumed by the American people. How will he do this? By sticking a camera in Helen super suit and making her both a walking virtual reality machine and a serious competition to twitch. From there, we meet the villains. Screensaver later revealed to be Evelyn mind controlling a pizza delivery guy. Everyone's motivation is actually a rather sophisticated critique of mindless media consumption and how it makes people passive participants in their own lives. She gives a truly epic monologue in which she complained about the way how everything meaningful must be packaged into talk shows, game shows, travel shows, etc. Gc supers as an essential part of that media landscape and that they offer a security and comfort that keeps the masses docile.

Speaker 1:          02:50          Now, this is where our philosophy census started tinGling the plot of inCredibles. Two is a neon sign pointing to philosopher slash guy. We'd like to mention a lot the genre baudrillard who wrote about the power of screens to influence our opinions and indeed control our lives. In his book screened out, he argues that video interactive screens and virtual reality have brought us into a state of perpetual interactivity where there's no longer any separation between the media we consume and lives we lead. If anything, he argues the virtual reality of the internet, tv, and video games seems more real than the world we inhabit and even supersedes reality. Both winston and evelyn take this theory and run with it in very different ways. Each is trying to use the mediated image. I eat the perception of superheroes to change reality. I belong. Baudrillard says that the real aim of media consumption is to hide or disappear into the virtual.

Speaker 1:          03:48          An idea that evelyn's goggles and screens exaggerate to great effect by hypnotizing people into a fugue state in which they are completely detached from the real world. In this way, the film warns about the harmful power of screens to control our lives. the immersive power of helen's pov crime fighting videos create exactly the kind of absorbing media bosure discusses. That's why they're so effective and immediately start shifting public opinion. Also, it's good for plot development. helen's emo of saving people from bad guys hasn't changed a bit, but now that people can see her bravery up close, it's suddenly more real at times. The movie isn't too subtle about any of this. At one point, evelyn and helen debate like drunk philosophy majors about whether the selling of the product I the mediated image of it is more important than the product itself. Now they can't come to a solid conclusion, which seems fair because modern philosophers can't either and they've had thousands of pages of writing on which to try.

Speaker 1:          04:46          Of course, we later learned that evelyn's beef with superheroes is less egg heady and more personal. WheN burglars broke into her family's home, her father counted on his superhero buddies to save him. Instead of using his safe room, he was shot dead. And as a result, she now blamed superheroes for her father's passed city and clear inability to think logically in high pressure situations. So she decides to use the very thing she despises the image of supers to destroy their viability and importance to her. Not only do screens make us passive observers in our own lives, but the image of superheroes on those screens does something similar. The images of benevolent, all powerful beings, perhaps primus, to believe like evelyn's dad, that our problems will be solved by strong altruistic individuals, but wait a second, aren't we to watching the incredibles? Two, a superhero movie through a screen and see, this is where the film gets potentially very subversive.

Speaker 1:          05:48          Are we not also participating in this same vicarious hero worship when we watched in awe as the incredible saved the day on the flashy silver screen? So what are we supposed to think of watching a superhero movie that criticizes the effects of selling superheroes? do mediated images? Well, ultimately the ending is pretty comforting to fans. Be incredible. Stop screen slaver supers are made legal again by some sort of un knockoff and evelyn is carted off by the police, but just when everything is about to be wrapped up nice and neat. Violet, who's third power is apparently sarcasm immediately jumps in to cast doubt on our happy ending saying, I'm sorry that she's super rich and will only get like two years in jail, so should the incredible saving the city from that giant yachts, warpath convinced us that everything's all good, or is brad bird pointing at something more sinister with violence?

Speaker 1:          06:40          Final quip is he suggesting that viewing such an uplifting ending brought by the hands of almighty benign superheroes might make us feel satisfied even pacified when in reality, whatever that is, there are still many injustices that need to be addressed, but what do you guys think?
