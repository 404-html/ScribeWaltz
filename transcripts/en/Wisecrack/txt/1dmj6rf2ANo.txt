Speaker 1:          00:08          I mean, it depends on who you are, you know, it's like, it's also shouldn't be a stressful thing, you know, it's like, it could mean that you take your family, uh, instead of, you know, to, uh, the price chopper, you take your family to the farmer's market once a week and you do, you know, it's a more expensive there. So you do some, some intelligent shopping and you'll cook a little bit more at home. And uh, you know, you, when you're at the farmers market, you're asking the farmer, you know, how is this pork raised and how is, what, what soil did this carrot growing and what kind of carrot is at and all of that. And maybe, you know, he has three different kinds of carrots that he's growing and, and you come back the next season and there's different carrots again. And so all of this becomes educational and, and inspiring.

Speaker 1:          00:47          And, and, and because of that more delicious. I mean, I think that's, you know, that's, that's one point that's, that's, that sometimes gets lost in all this is that, you know, as chefs, you know, one of the great assets that we have are these, these front of house staff. He's waiters to an end myself to, to, to tell stories about what we're doing. You know, where this food is coming from. You know, without the story. You lead to a lot of that, this association you were talking about before, you know, it's the story that separates the small family farmer and even the midsize Pharma from the big food chain because all along the food chain, you know, from seed to farmer to trucker to distributor to marketplace. Price is the determining factor. But when you have a story from a small family farm about a carat and about the soil it's growing in and what that farmers, grandfather grew in that same soil. If you have a quick narrative like that, you have something that's so unique and, and so, uh, infectious to people who want this kind of food and it informs their appetite. Literally.
