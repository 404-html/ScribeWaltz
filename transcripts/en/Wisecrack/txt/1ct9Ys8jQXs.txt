Speaker 1:          00:06          [inaudible] and violence cannot be assessed by headlines. Headlines are about things that happen and they give you no indication whatsoever of how common a particular activity as a cause. You'd never see reporter standing outside a school saying, I, here I am in front of the Maplewood high school, which hasn't been shot up today. Uh, or here I am in the capital of Mozambican. There's no civil war. So forget headlines. You have to, the only way to answer the question of what are the trends in violence is to look at data where you count the number of occurrences as a proportion of the number of opportunities. And you see whether that's changed over time. So since I wrote better angels of our nature, and, uh, I sent it off to the press in, uh, end of 2010. So the data that were available from Warfarin, oh eight, oh nine, uh, I keep yearly updates on what's happened to those trends.

Speaker 1:          00:56          And with the exception of civil war, which after a rollercoaster downward from the end of World War II has shown something of an uptick, uh, because of the Syrian civil war, it's wiped out about 13 years of progress taking us back to the level of luck, 2000 white, it's still a fraction of the level that it was at in the 60s, 70s and 80s, when you had not just, uh, uh, eight or nine civil wars going on at a time, but a 25 or 30, uh, we, we tend to forget them. We tend to be amnesic about, uh, all those nasty wars in Africa and Southeast Asia that were going on in the, in the seventies and eighties. But a lot of them had a considerable death tall. So it's clearly things have gotten worse in, in Syria. They've gotten worse in Ukraine and, uh, and um, Pakistan, but the global trend has not, uh, reverse the progress that we have seen by any means.

Speaker 1:          01:49          Then all the other trends such as homicide, which kills far more people than wars, uh, continues to go down. Sexual violence, at least in countries that have good data, have continued to go down. Rape and domestic violence. Child abuse has continued to go down more and more states and countries have abolished capital punishment, even democratization of government. The absence of government violence where we're aware of backsliding in countries like Venezuela and that Turkey and Russia, but still the global trend continues to beat that the world is getting more democratic. We don't read about the countries that have liberalized, but we hear about the countries that are increased their repression and that they do exist. But on the whole, the world has become more democratic as well as less homicidal, uh, less, um, uh, gender based violence, less child abuse and so on. And, um, even in the category of war, you can divide wars into wars between countries.

Speaker 1:          02:43          Old fashioned wars of country, a declares war on country B and civil wars. And, uh, uh, the first category, interstate wars, uh, government on each side has been in, um, kind of sputtering decline for many decades. Uh, there are and fewer wars between countries. The wars that exist are civil wars and, um, that has, uh, that record has continued to, to, um, uh, to, uh, to improve. Uh, namely, we've had zero interstate wars since the better angels of our nature was published. And in fact, we've had zero interstate wars since the American invasion of Iraq in 2003. And historically, wars between countries tend to kill more people than civil wars. So even with the backsliding that we've seen in, uh, in the case of civil war, in the case of the most destructive form of wars, the world is still not seeing a return today. The battle days of the seventies and eighties.
