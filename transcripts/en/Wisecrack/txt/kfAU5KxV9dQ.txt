Speaker 1:          00:08          Was having a baby this week on thought nosebleeds, straight clown and with it by Stephen King movies. Gabs bad of me.

Speaker 2:          00:19          No,

Speaker 1:          00:20          you better recognize it's this big ass book. Always jumping across two time periods, but since town like that will be a bit. I'm going to land on your chronological age. Nineteen 57 and it's random balls in the town of Derry man. One little shorty George playing with a paper boat made by his older brother bill so that both flow into the storm drain where man, they got some weird crackheads and dairy. Anyway, George tried to snatch that boat back from the cloud. Spray rip him off. He did three months go by and the boy named Ben Rolling back to the crib when hold up that same red nose, Hayden, the clown ass. If you want to grab a balloon and chill and Ben's tempted, but he say, Nah, I'm straight and the cloud to a damn mommy and ben like books. The bench on a duck, a thug name, Henry bowers, and it's cooler gangbangers by laying low in the barons where you become tight with homies who also getting their ass whooped by Henry George older bro.

Speaker 1:          01:29          Bill and his cat, Ben, Bill and Addie got already in a dam with some other young bloods name Richie and stands rob by. Turns out most of them is seeing I clown on the. So as a girl named beverly and a brother named Mike together, all these cats make up the loser's club and Reggie thinking it's got to be the ghost and all these little kids and dairy eventually that recognize the cloud shacked up in the sewers and change shape you to some glamour. Apparently the only way to end that fool is my busting a mad lib flow of jokes and rentals while buying on edge tongue. Oh, it's called the ritual of June and yeah, man, it sounds pretty freaking. What I like it. My show loses his daddy's collection of all those photos. Now what do you know that clown all up in those crusty stills, man, this dude older than, Oh damn.

Speaker 1:          02:26          I'm trying to bust out the photo and be all like break because I'm coming for you. Oh, I don't like this clown man. Slow the losers. Do the logical thing and get so high and tripped balls imagining it crash on earth. No, it's a years ago later it gets even wider. When he shape shifts into the moon and start conversation with Henry bowers, he slides a blade and say, Yo daddy and that girl, beverly got to grow so Shank Papa bowers. Get out here. We get the jump on Bev and while she's struggling to just watch it go down without even doing nothing but bev don't play man. She kicks him right in the nuts and bells that go hook up with the losers. Bill starts getting crunk about how all the adults don't give a fuck about what's happening to the kids and dairy, so data side, they got to be the ones to pull up on that beast.

Speaker 1:          03:24          So they grew up and head down to the sewers. Thing is Harry and his posse creeping up from behind, but it ain't long before it goes cold to Henry's boys and Henry gets lost for hours. I have to record it with an inhaler and some choice words. The losers roll up on edge layer and bill gets his ass lost in some kind of a void. And if you think this Jan was trippy before, peep this it out. A giant turtle who created the universe say, Yo, if you really want to kill it, you best are laying down that tube. So bill stopped flowing, bite down on the monster's tongue and it scurry away like a little low bitch Lillo clown bitch. After that, the losers can't find their way out of the tunnels. But beverly got an idea. Hey Boys, drop your draws and fuck me.

Speaker 1:          04:16          Wait what? These kids are only 11 stephen man. So after the assembly line and a freak, nasty oof the losers find their way out of the sewers. They all swear that if the creature ain't dead, they got to come back and put it in the ground no matter what. And as for Henry, that full gets tossed in a loony bin and tastes the fall for all of its murders. Dan, 27 years later, the children started disappearing and dairy again and might get suspicious. So he hollered at his old crew and say, get your ass over here. And bloods and his back. So all the losers hustled back to dairy except stand who get so wigged out, he slipped his damn risks. Meanwhile, Henry get a visit from it who tell them, it's time to bust out of the house to get revenge on those losers, the cloud being a real dick, making the losers relive all kinds of nasty mess from their childhood.

Speaker 1:          05:14          And if that ain't enough, babs asshole hobby. And Bill's wife come to town on the bouncy. Later, Henry Bowers, Shane's Mike at the library, but he's still kicking with a little help from it. Henry, head over to the hotel, the ghost, the losers. But Eddie keeping clutch. And Merck's Henry the way most gangsters do it with a bottle of perrier. Oh, classic. I begin word that might get racked it. Mind control. Bev's husband and snatch bills. Woman. The losers are all like, no fucking around man. Time to end this food. I have to send more crazy. The losers drop in at it's digs, feel. Richie and abby started laying down the ritual, a head up into that void and it chops addys Damn Arma. He dead. What a monster started crawling away. Been bused. Everyone zags and bill crushes. Ed's hard like a jake. Now that it's finally dead. They grabbed bill's wife and chunk out of the tunnel. No Gang Bang required this time. Oh, the losers go their separate ways and slowly started the good. What the hell just happened? Bill's wife all whacked out in the head from all the crazy she saw, but after bill gives her a ride with his goofy ass childhood bike. She snaps right out of it, but still don't remember what went down.

Speaker 1:          06:40          You might be thinking, why would a gnarly beast like it set up shop in a hub like dairy? Well, this ain't the innocent small town. It seemed like, oh, that leave it to beaver. They got a dog side brewing under it. People who are crooked, violent, racist, and don't give a damn about what's happening to these little kids. See, it acted like a mirror of the crooked ass. People in dairy just picked this quote of homies jabbering about the monster. The one glimpse I called him, it looked like he had a winchester board action and it wasn't until later that I figured out I must have thought of that because that's what I thought he had a remington because that was what he had and when I asked Jimmy about it, he said that guy was shooting the nose spray field just like this. Funny, Huh?

Speaker 1:          07:30          Hey brotha. Remember the monster packing the same piece? There were packing weapon. That the clown is a reflection of all the raw violence inside the heart. Autumn Hood, rats. Matter of fact, ain't no mistake that it roll around decked out. Lack of clown cars, just like a clown. The people of dairy seemed nice to the kids on the outside, but on the inside it's all flows back. Clown wouldn't even exist if it weren't for dairies. Dark deeds. See it is only able to hit the scene when a horrible event go down like child abuse on murder. It's like a gnarly cycle where the messed up things the dairy folk do inspires it to terrorize the people, which then encourages the people to do even more wax because this cycle just keeps going and going. It's been chilling in dairy for a long ass time. It's become a part of dairy, something as much a part of the town is the stand pipe or the Canal Abassi Park or the library.

Speaker 1:          08:29          Oh, it's not a matter of our geography. Somehow it's gotten inside this whole cycle. Jam Go even deeper because there'd be circular imagery all up in this huge ass book. The kids struggled back to this hood roots when they returned to dairy as adults to lay a whip on the monster beverly replaced or abusive daddy was an abusive husband. The only way they're able to beat it in the end, it's about throwing back to the mental of that childhood and flats in their imagination. They even recognize that past events happening all over again, like when big boy band pink, some bz reading the same story she read back in the day, am I supposed to believe that's just coincidence because I don't. There's something really stable in the past and present together here or I'm only imagining it. The losers always form a circle at important points.

Speaker 1:          09:20          Like when they promised a wreck it if he dad shows his face and Debbie again, when adults try to remember what went down back then and even when everybody gathers around a tab, beverly, that Ah, nevermind man, I can't say that she's the only like 11, maybe all this cycle job. Just preaching a greater point about evil just like it. Evil been around since the beginning of time, but it's only one humans arrived that it started to take shape. It says humans keep doing dark deeds over and over again at been thriving for centuries. So maybe that's King's message evil only because for real, when humans are allowed to take control of bus and got all my nasty qualities like greed, jealousy, and violence, it's always been here since the beginning of time, since before there were men anywhere it was here. Then sleeping, maybe waiting for the ice to melt, waiting for the people to come out.
