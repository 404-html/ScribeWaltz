Speaker 1:          00:03          A wise crack jared incarnate again, and we've got another wise crack quick take on this week's rick and morty. Episode Pickle Rick. I'm pickle. I'm here to answer the question, why does rick turned into a pickle and yes, it's partly because Dan Harmon said, rick is a pickle in a writer's room, brainstorm harm, and just goes, oh, and then there's the other easy answer to avoid family therapy, but if you stick with me, I'm going to argue that rick's being as pickle can teach us a lot about freedom, woken loose, wise, crack quick, take on pickle rick and of course spoilers ahead, but first a recap. Rick, if you couldn't produce, has turned himself into a pickle to get out of family therapy, but things go awry and he ends up fighting his way out of a sewer and later a Russian embassy using a Mech suit made out of Roche parts and rap. Lynn's meanwhile, Beth summer and morty have to go to family therapy after summer huffed pottery and animal and morty peed his pants. There's a clever parallel between Beth and rick in this episode, just as Rick goes to insane lengths to avoid bearing his emotions and therapy. Beth is doing her best to stonewall her school, appointed therapist, and maintain her emotional distance.

Speaker 2:          01:10          I think it's possible that you and your father have a very specific dynamic. I don't think it's one that rewards emotion or vulnerability. I think it may punish them. I think it's possible that dynamic you voted your marriage and as infecting your kids with the tendency to Mr. Hack their feelings,

Speaker 1:          01:28          both of you to one thing we've noticed in the season is that there's more emphasis on serialized arcs. In the last episode, Rick is willing to stay in Mad Max land to avoid dealing with his daughters divorce. My Dad has gone through a divorce and I am not dealing with it in a healthy way at all. Now he's literally turned himself into a pickle to run away from reality, and Mourdian summers seem increasingly damaged by their parents' divorce.

Speaker 2:          01:51          I am mad that I can't have enamel without people assuming it's because my family is sex. With

Speaker 1:          01:59          continuation, we've noticed a few themes that seem to be slowly developing. One of which is freedom. This quote from Dr Wong really sets the stage for our discussion.

Speaker 2:          02:08          I think it's because the only truly unapproachable concept for you is that it's your mind within your control. You chose to come here. You chose to talk to belittle my vocation. Just as you chose to become a pickle. Each of us gets to choose.

Speaker 1:          02:23          At first, Dr Wong's monologue seemed a little strange. After all, how could rick not understand that he's in control? He can do anything including turned himself into a pickle. The reason anyone would do this, if they could, which they can't, would be because they could, which they can, but after digging through my notes on the ugliest of existential philosophers, I think Dr Wong's monologue gets us to something quite insightful. As we all know, Rick doesn't believe in God. There is no god. Summer. Got to rip that bandaid off. Now. You'll thank me later and for philosophers, John Paul Sarte. Godlessness means we are radically free to define our own existence, but we choose to do things based on social pressures or who we think we're supposed to be, and all kinds of other bolts start calls this acting in bad faith, but since we're mortal, there's a fixed amount of choices to make in our lives. What sarc calls finitude, and each of those choices prevents other choices. Choosing to be a truck driver means choosing not to be a teacher. To deny the importance of our finite choices is another way to act in bad faith. Often we pretend to not have a choice as west side story puts it.

Speaker 2:          03:28          Hi, nick. Sergeant, crop, yet gotta understand. It's just odd bringing upkeep that gets us out of hand. Our mothers are junkies are fathers, all are drunks. Golly. Most naturally your punks,

Speaker 1:          03:41          essentially the hopelessness know they're acting like a bunch of little, but instead of choosing to be better, they relinquished their choice and blame it on their negligent parents. That's why I'm so bad. They just can't help themselves. But what's unique about rick is that he doesn't deal with finitude. He deals with infinitude. My access to infinite timelines precludes the necessity of attachment. Rick has to grapple with the exact opposite of what SARC proposed because to call back to season one, there's an infinite number of realities. Morty rest, SARC criticizes the person who won't take responsibility for their choices. Rick thinks he doesn't have to because he's already made them and all the infinite versions of himself. If Stuart said the human condition was one, a finite choices, well, rick has transcended that human condition with science, but as Dr Wong suggests, justifying your actions with the multiverse or your godlike intelligence isn't a solution because although intelligence can help you make a decision, you still have to make the decision.

Speaker 2:          04:36          The only connection between your unquestionable intelligence and the sickness destroying your family is that everyone in your family, you included use intelligence to justify sickness.

Speaker 1:          04:46          Despite the fact that rick is the master of his universe, he paradoxically has yet to come to terms with his own choices. No matter how many versions of Rick exists, nothing can stop the fact that his choices are uniquely his own. Because to quote Dr Wong,

Speaker 2:          05:00          the only truly unapproachable concept for you is that it's your mind within your control.

Speaker 1:          05:05          In season one, Rick Straight up tells us how he deals with the infinite choice in the multiverse. What about the reality where Hitler cured cancer? Morty, the answer is don't think about it, but of course all therapy does this make you think about things? So rick turns himself into a pickle to avoid choice or at least the appearance of it as a helpless armless pickle. It's not his fault if he can't make therapy, and in that sense Rick's blatant disregard for his choices, as SARC would say, is acting in bad faith. Speaking of arcs, this ties nicely into what we talked about in the last episode between Jerry's powerlessness, mortise resentment of him for that very reason, and the juxtaposition with Rick as an all powerful madman, but I don't respect therapy because I'm a scientist because I invent transformed, create, destroy for a living. And when I don't like something about the world, I'd change it.

Speaker 1:          05:52          This season is really leading into ideas of agency and I'm super excited to see what they come up with next. There's one last thing worth noting, but it's probably more of a stretch. You know, the common characterization of Freud's work as everything is a penis. Well, I'm convinced someone in their writer's room probably took this loose connection between a phallic object in therapy and who went to little wild with it.
