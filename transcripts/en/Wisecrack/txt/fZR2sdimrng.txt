Speaker 1:          00:04          Hey guys, Helen again, so I know we've talked about rick and morty have bought, but well, jared has been lamenting the lack of meaning in our asshole universe. I thought it was time to give science a chance to shine light on everyone's favorite negligent grandpa and his, uh, talented career savvy son in law.

Speaker 2:          00:20          When do we need food? When we're hungry.

Speaker 1:          00:25          Specifically, I wanted to see what psychology had to say about a problem we've all been asking ourselves, is rick destined to be miserable because of his intelligence? And if so, is it better to be a jerry? If you asked 19th century author Theodore dust way up ski, he would probably say no as he famously puts it in the idiot. It is better to be unhappy and know the worst than to be happy in a fool's paradise. Dostoevsky statement seems quite apt and describing the dynamic between Jerry and rick. Rick's despondency is driven by his knowledge that nothing matters. While a fool's paradise might as well just be Jerry burry, Visha Maillian simulation. Yes. You just sold the apples campaign. Who just sold the apples campaign? Pluto or the titanic. Oh, look, it's the line for the bow, so it's Dostoevsky, right? We'll break it down in this wise crack addition on the psychology of Rick and morty and being smart make you miserable and as always, spoilers ahead for being the smartest man in the universe. Rick, surprisingly relatable as cocreator Dan harmon puts it. When you're standing in line at that bank, sometimes you always feel like none of these people understand what a hurry I'm in, how much crap I have to do today, what I'm up against. We've all been rick, and as much as it sucks to admit, a lot of us can also probably identify with his self loathing and self destructive behavior.

Speaker 2:          01:44          Maybe I hate myself. Maybe I think I deserved to die. I, I don't. I don't know.

Speaker 1:          01:50          Rick is practically omnipotent with the power to invent, transform, and destroy his way into getting whatever he wants. Yet despite all that power, he's miserable. On the other hand, there's Jerry who's a little bit dumb and a lot of bit discombobulated. Jerry operates best when he doesn't have to think too much because when he does, he generally makes things worse, but even when he's down in the deepest of dumps, he doesn't seem to suffer to the same degree that rick does. Jerry may not have street smarts or be able to hold down a job, but he's also not hitting the bottle or questioning his place in the universe and his barber. Happiness seems low, so is it better to be a rick or a jerry? First? Let's look at Rick. His inner turmoil leaks out in some subtle and not so subtle ways like his famous catchphrase 40. Do you know what?

Speaker 2:          02:41          Oh, that's just stupid nonsense. Catchphrase. It's not nonsense at all in my people's tongue. It means I am in great pain. Please help me

Speaker 1:          02:50          and obviously that way to real suicide attempt in season two, but is it because he's smart? The stereotype of the tortured genius is so deeply into pop culture that we should wonder whether it's overblown Hollywood bullshit, the roster of famous folks from history who have suffered from crushing depression and the attention given to the brilliance madness link by the media almost makes it seem like depression is a prerequisite to success, but there are obviously plenty of brilliant people who didn't suffer from mental illness or were otherwise normal. They just aren't to sensational. Right? Listicles about as say, a guy who fell in love with a pigeon, so is it true? Does being a genius or even just pretty smart make you destined for misery? Well, maybe one study as 3,700 Mensa members or people who were so proud of their Iq scores that they joined an organization to brag about it if they were currently dealing with mental illness more than a third said they were depressed.

Speaker 1:          03:42          To put that in context, that's five times the national average. If you rounded up 100 Mensa members and 100 regular people, about six to seven of those regular people would probably be depressed. Well, more than 30 of the MENSA members would be a few caveats. The mensa members were asked to self report on their own wellbeing here, of those who reported feeling depressed, roughly 10 percent didn't have a doctor telling them they actually had depression. As anyone who spends way too much time googling symptoms knows the art of self diagnosis is far from perfect. Plus are these medicines representative of all smart people? Probably not. Still, there might be a biological basis for why highly intelligent people are prone to depression. Her pinsky who random mensa study asserted the people with Iqs of 130 plus have hyper brands. That is, they can comprehend the world's problems, uncertainties and possibilities more easily than people with non-hyper brains.

Speaker 1:          04:33          The whole hyper brain idea was based on the work of psychiatrist Dr. Kasim Years Dubroski, who noticed his exceptionally smart patients had a tendency to overly contemplate everything, especially the bad stuff. At times. They also seem to experience deeper depression compared to the intellectually average. These traits were part of a group of characteristics that he called over excitability. He didn't see it as a bad thing. Instead, he thought it was predictive of the potential for being able to achieve the most ideal version of oneself. In 1972, he wrote one who manifests several forms of over excitability, sees reality in a different, stronger, and more excitable manner. Debraski said that overexcited abilities come and five flavors, excessive energy or nervousness, deep appreciation for things like art or music being extremely curious or having an active mind, having a vivid imagination, and finally extreme and complex emotional experiences. Rick is a textbook example of all of these things. He still slaying aliens on the rig at 70 years old freestyles award winning tracks on a whim you gotta to use with me.

Speaker 1:          05:40          Okay. Maybe that's not appreciation, but still can be just a tiny bit over analytical. I can prove it mathematically is capable of thinking up and inventing entire worlds and has seriously complicated feelings for his family. While it hasn't been tested, some psychologists believe that people who think this way are more prone to what's called existential depression. It's exactly what it sounds like. Feelings of hopelessness that come from wondering whether life is ultimately meaningless. Dr James Webb, a psychologist who studies gifted kids notes the well existential depression can happen to anybody following a crisis. It's more likely to happen spontaneously to people whose intelligence is above average. Rick never comes out and says he's crushed beneath the weight of a futile existence, but he certainly comes close. You know, smart people get a chance to climb on top, take reality for a ride, but it'll never stop trying to throw you.

Speaker 1:          06:31          Eventually it will. There's no other way off. On top of that, he's bored senseless, virtually nothing in our own mundane world impresses him, but his intellectual prowess and imagination enable him to find temporary reprieve from boredom by way of his portal, gun aided adventures. Oh, and alcohol. Contrast this with Jerry. Jerry possesses none of the traits, psychologist associated with hyper brain, unless you count getting super stoked about rare coins. There's little r two. D Two is where the George Washington should be done. Mobile Games or the titanic, so does that mean he's inherently happier, but before we get there, real life. Helen, here for a second. I want to take a minute to talk about this video spots or better help, which is an online counseling service for those of you who saw our booth Burnham video, you know jared gave him a girl and he dug it knowing I like many people might be able to benefit from talking to someone on a regular basis.

Speaker 1:          07:19          He suggested I give them a try too, so I did stick around to the end of the video to hear more about my experience. And in the meantime, go to [inaudible] dot com slash wise, correct. One to learn more. Now, back to Jerry. Okay, so does Jerry's daringness mean he's happier news, but it's complicated. Well, some studies may suggest that being smart makes you more likely to be depressed. Others suggests that intelligence gives you the ability to unlock a lot of amazing doors in life that will make you healthier and sometimes happier. Specifically money as pretty much all of the studies on Iq and depression point out being smart is associated with greater wealth and therefore better health. Oh, sometimes it gets hard to distinguish what causes what? Among the zillions of criticisms of Iq tests is the kids who come from well off families are more likely to be tested in the first place.

Speaker 1:          08:09          That being said, the relationship between achievement, money, and intelligence throws a wrench in the idea that genius equals misery. In some studies, having a higher Iq has actually been associated with greater happiness. One study looked at more than 6,800 people and found that I was positively correlated with well self reported. Happiness genius has long been associated with eccentricities and few geniuses, fictional or otherwise can live up to the centricity of Rick Sanchez. It's safe to say rick has a tendency to overwhelm people with his intensity. Some researchers have said this is a hallmark of people with high Iq, but these eccentricities may freak out. The normal minded people around them leaving our geniuses socially isolated. Trying to roll with the normies requires minimizing that intensity which can lead to a so called crisis of self, where conformity makes people feel lost and confused about who they really are. One could argue that Rick's in a perpetual crisis of self on earth. He's forever an oddball and while that doesn't seem to concern him too much, it does mean he asked to compromise his nature for the sake of his relationship with his family, like when he finally shows up to therapy,

Speaker 3:          09:17          I have no doubt that you would be bored senseless by therapy the same way on board when I brushed my teeth and wipe my ass, because the thing about repairing, maintaining and cleaning is it's not an adventure.

Speaker 1:          09:29          Yeah. Just because jerry isn't an eccentric genius, doesn't mean he doesn't have his own problems fitting in. He's seriously lacking in social skills. Very stop networking. We're in space survival skills. I'm not proud to share this, but the truth is I just kept crawling and kept working or skills of any kind. Really. He's most successful in a career where he doesn't even know what he does. Our Ya the Galactic Federation taking over Earth's best thing that's ever happened in his family. I just got my six promotion this week and I still don't know what I do and is otherwise so utterly incompetent that he has to beg his kids for money. Oh God. Todd, please don't just need a few hundred dollars to get through them on. I have some interviews coming up. Something's going to come through. I can see it. Ultimately, as Rick points out after the worldly Durley fiasco, the only reason Jerry's able to get by is because everyone feels sorry for him.

Speaker 1:          10:14          You act like prey, but you're a predator. You use pity to lure in your victim how you survive. Rick gets his way by intimidating. People fall. Jerry relies on their mercy, so let's recap. Some research suggests that the hyper brains of highly intelligent people make them more prone to depression mainly because they see the world in a different way and are more intense than your average homosapien, which is kind of a turnoff to the average joes, but at the same time, the fact that they can leverage their smarts for high paying jobs that enable them to avoid the stresses of poverty and afford better healthcare means that as a group, they're more likely to be happier. Overall. To our original question, is it really better to know the worst and be unhappy than to be happy in a fool's paradise? To be a rick rather than a jerry research says, well, that's a subjective asked question and frankly, psychology doesn't have a concrete answer.

Speaker 1:          11:04          Thanks psychology. I went to school for you, but for limited evidence that is out there, so just that while you may be less likely to suffer from existential depression as a jerry, you're more likely to live a better life overall as a rick, but which would you rather be? Wisecrack. Drop us a line in the comments below and thanks for watching. All right guys, thanks for sitting around. So this video was sponsored by the online counseling service, better health. We've talked about them before and they wound up sponsoring this video to better help. Takes an inventory of what you're looking for in therapy and then they match you with a licensed counselor within 24 hours. I'm a full time journalist who freelances for companies like wisecrack on the side, so it's really hard for me to commit to a set time for therapy every week.

Speaker 1:          11:47          My therapist was extremely patient and totally understood my crazy schedule. Plus she was really accessible and responsive. One of the best parts about it is that you don't have to talk to your therapist over video conferencing if you don't want to, or if you just don't have time, you can reach out to them over the phone or through messaging or through live chat and you can get ahold of them while you were in your garage or your bed or wherever, and it's all completely confidential. We all know we should make mental health a priority, but getting over the stigma or just finding the time can be super challenging.
