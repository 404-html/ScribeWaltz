Speaker 1:          00:03          Wise, crack real life. Jared here, I know you got used to only rick and morty quick takes, but the biggest show on earth just wrapped its seventh season and man, there were some amazing moments. The Jamie Tyrian Reunion, incredible battles, lady [inaudible] Lennon's death scene. Aria murdering the phrase the Zombie Dragon going ham. Plenty of awesome stuff. But to be honest, in our humble opinion, the show just doesn't feel as a magical anymore. And of course we had to ask ourselves why. Game of thrones, by virtue of adapting George Rr Martin is revolutionary series got us all hooked by refusing to play by the rules of the fantasy genre or even normal tv. It took turns. We never saw coming killed characters we were sure would be around for the end game and turn the tropes of the fantasy genre inside out. It was that willingness to show the ugly side of the Lords and ladies that made us fall in love.

Speaker 1:          00:54          These days it's feeling a little eagles rescue the boys from Mount Doom. Why? Maybe it's because game of thrones set up the unique specific rules for its world. Made promises about what we could expect or not expect. And now that it's time to pay off those ideas, well it just feels like a different show. So let's talk about whether or not dineros and friends have lost their edge in today's quick take on game of thrones season seven and as always, spoilers ahead before we can explain what's going on with theme of thrones, we need to talk about story structure, react structure to be specific. Even if you've never heard that phrase before, you've seen it in action because almost every story in the world follows it. Without getting too much into detail, we can describe three x structure like this. In Act one the major players in central conflicts are introduced in act two events complicate those conflicts.

Speaker 1:          01:45          And finally in act three of these conflicts are resolved. These categories are used to describe parts of a story. So while they may seem like arbitrary cutoff points, they are indicative of patterns we see in almost every story. So let's take that basic structure and apply it to game of thrones. Act One is the first two seasons we meet the lannisters. The starks Denaris and the whole gang. We learned about the iron throne and how everybody wants it. We even see the white walkers the first that culminates with each side taking positions and making their moves. Act Two is the war itself. We see the costs. Rob As the red wedding, Stan is burning his daughter, joffrey getting poisoned all with the undead threat looming in the background. These days we're firmly enact three John and Danny are preparing to face off with the white walkers.

Speaker 1:          02:29          While CRC is going crazy, trying to hang onto her new found power. The show pretty much nailed acts one and two not only did they establish characters in conflict, they did so in a creative way that challenged our expectations after season one who really thought we'd all grow a soft spot for Jamie lannister. The thing is all these twists and turns set us up to expect an ending that would follow the same unpredictable pattern. Sounds weird. I know, but that's what made it so great and season seven that's turning into a bit of a challenge. So let's see how it happened. The show. May Two major promises early on. First, it was a dedication to breaking down the attractiveness of the fantasy world. It's not all gowns and gallantry. Instead, it showed us the dark underbelly and cruelty that infects every inch of Westerns. The nights aren't paragons of justice.

Speaker 1:          03:20          They're rapists and murderers. The beautiful prince isn't kind. He's a spoiled monster. Honor doesn't help you reach new heights. It puts you in jail. Magic isn't something friendly. It involves sacrifices and shadow monsters, but good guys who fight for justice don't always win. In fact, they usually die because everyone else is playing dirty. The landslide Gwen of your style, forbidden love between a knight and his Queen in Game of thrones, that's incest. This is the show that killed robb stark who would be the hero in any other fantasy story at his uncle's Dang wedding, a double subversions. Since rob was living out the narrative of love overcoming all, only it did the lannisters cutoff Ned's head because he was too loyal. They shoved a kid out a window for seeing something he shouldn't have. These moments were more than just cool Vitsa TV. There were signals that game of thrones was not business as usual.

Speaker 1:          04:13          That brings us to the second major promise. The show promised us that actions would have consequences. We see this in episode one. A man shirks is nightwatch duties and ned decapitating, no questions asked. That's the world of the show. Nothing comes without a cost and even the greatest victories can have ramifications. The characters never expected. There's a storytelling value at play here. It means that everything matters. That's why this is the show that launched a million conspiracy theories for several seasons. Consequences where the law of the land, for example, why is no one mad at Cersi for blowing up the CEP and killing Marjorie Tyrrell? Someone we know was hugely popular. Do they just not know? Maybe it's because they're mad at CRC or afraid of her, but these folks seem like they're doing just fine. We can also see this and how the show handles travel. These days.

Speaker 1:          05:04          The logistics push the limits of plausibility. For instance, Dendri turns into Usain Bolt and sends a raven at a speed far greater than an unladen swallow, which crosses Westeros a continent described as the size of South America to Generis who flies her dragon's back across the continent all before the magnificent seven can even get frost in their beards. See, it's not just that fast travel strains credulity. It actively harms the dramatic action of the show when travel stops being a factor. So does the danger of traveling. One huge element of the travel times in thrones Burley storytelling is the implication that something could go wrong on any trip. Bandon, Stoneman, slavers, whatever that risk means that we can imagine a huge number of possible outcomes, but in fast travel world, that's not really on the table. All of that nuance, the repercussions, the sense that anything can happen any moment is now gone.

Speaker 1:          05:59          It got traded for expedited plotting and well, it's a trade that makes sense. There were only 13 episodes left when the season started, but it's changed. The nature of the show. Game of thrones was so interesting for the first five seasons in change because it was decidedly not your daddy's fantasy story. Now, this is something that any parent could recognize. All the tired and familiar tropes that game of thrones was deconstructing are back in full force on ambiguous evil Quebec on killable chosen ones. Check Dsx, Mokena rescues and check, check, check. This isn't a show heading in new different directions. This is a show that is checking third act boxes. That's not necessarily a bad thing, but it's checking them in a way that defies the narrative framework. We spent five years internalizing even the finale, which was pretty dang good, showed off all these problems.

Speaker 1:          06:53          As the season came to a close, we got clear sides, something game of thrones has been reluctant to offer us. Now all the characters we like are on one side. There's no room for ethical ambiguity. So why is this happening? Well, it goes back to that three act structure. Thousands of years of storytelling indicate that to create a satisfying narrative, the show needs to have all the work that Danny, John and others have put into change. The world actually pay off. Unfortunately, that's how all fantasy stories and the good guys always win against incredible odds. The subversion doesn't work anymore when it comes to the end game. Even the craziest brand is the night king type ending doesn't really subvert anything and ending where this was all inevitable because of magic or time travel undermines the theme of agency in the show and it's just another fantasy trope for the show to fall back on.

Speaker 1:          07:44          Unfortunately, it seems the show can't get to the ending it wants while still disrupting the fantasy narrative space from the beginning. Game of thrones has told us that we're getting a different kind of fantasy story, but this past season it felt more like Lord of the rings than the Sopranos and honestly it's a bit disappointing. Look at the end of the day, it's still a good show, but it's an action fantasy story and that's not what they promised us. Thanks for watching guys piece.
