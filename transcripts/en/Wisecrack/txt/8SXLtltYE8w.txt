Speaker 1:          00:00          This video is sponsored by crunchy roll. What's up wise? Crack Jared again. Today we're covering the only show guaranteed to traumatize you in its first 10 minutes. Goblin slayer. Now, while much of the conversation surrounding the show focuses on that notorious scene that we're all aware of, there's something else going on that is a really interesting development for the fantasy genre and it all revolves around the question, why does Goblin slayer only killed goblins? And how does that form the shows greater message? Well, let's bathe in Goblin blood and go deep in this wise crack condition on Goblin slayer. And as always, spoilers ahead. Let's kick it off with a quick recap, a bright eyed priestess. No one has real names in this show. And friends set out on their first adventure, eager to kill goblins. But uh, things go wrong, very, very wrong for friends die. But Goblin slayer rescues her in the nick of time. She joins his party and becomes his Goblin slaying paddle won. Their party grows when an Elf dwarf and Lizard man joined them to investigate some particularly worrisome goblins on the border. Then they head off to kill even more sewer, goblins, all the while a demon lord is threatening the realm and our hero seriously does not care.

Speaker 2:          01:11          Niac the whole damn damn. Oh Shit. That's a good example. Is Key. The God, so today.

Speaker 3:          01:25          Cool, cool. Go. But he like you and I. Why?

Speaker 1:          01:29          Well, sure. There's actual narrative reasons they killed his sister.

Speaker 3:          01:33          Well, can you about gun Greece,

Speaker 1:          01:40          but because we like to get Metta, we wanted to address this question as it pertains to the genre that the show is playing. Fantasy. Okay. Yeah. It's animated, but the show is pretty heavy on references to d and D. There's the dice rolling spell slots, guilds, quests, and a hodgepodge of other fantasy tropes. The show relishes in the generics of the fantasy genre. Characters and places have intentionally generic names as the show prefers labels like Elvin, ranger watertown or sword maiden. Even big bosses get nomenclatures like Goblin champion or demon Lord. So let's talk about generic fantasy and novels. Tabletop games or MMOS heroes start with the small stuff. Rats, bugs, goblins. They grind through these small challenges until they're ready to take on stronger and more interesting enemies, but then some horrifying villain emerges and threatens the world as you know it. The story starts with small problems and builds to a big one, and once that big one is slane, then things can go back to being peg. Goblin slayer steps off that linear path with a resounding, you know what? I'd rather just kill goblins things you rationalize. This is choice when his compatriots try to get them to care about more pressing matters.

Speaker 3:          02:54          Do you know about the globe edema, moodle multiples? You

Speaker 2:          03:00          know, Chemo Goulburn, and we'll meet over to you and you know.

Speaker 1:          03:02          See even if the demon Lord dies, the Goblin slayer argues goblins will still terrorize rural and vulnerable areas. By having our protagonists phobia, saul on the little guys of sorts, goblins, player subverts the basic assumptions of the fantasy genre, namely the happily ever after. Do things go back to normal. When we've murdered, the big bad guy has the hero achieved peace, not quite eight litany of less spectacular monster. Still plague the villagers in the most recent episode. The Demon Lords death confirms this while the constant reference to the demon Lord earlier in the season would normally foreshadows some kind of climactic end of seasons showdown. So he just say the opposite happens. The demon Lord is dispatched in under a minute by some random heroes that we neither know nor care about, and instead of suggesting some happily ever after where instead reminded of these words from the sword maiden

Speaker 2:          03:54          say the school. Cool. So can you pick a Canadian?

Speaker 1:          04:12          We can better understand Goblin slayers logic. What's something called theory, which is pretty much exactly what it sounds like. It asks, what exactly is piece one theorist John Dalton draws a distinction between two kinds of peace, positive and negative. Negative peace is the absence of war. It's the kind of piece you're used to talking about the end of World War II or the Vietnam war or the civil war. You get it in the fantasy genre. We can think of it as the absence of night canes or sour on organic door I e o world without the demon lords destroying the world as we know it. That's fine and Dandy for peace theorists, but it doesn't examine these smaller and often more pervasive violence that affects society's most vulnerable people.

Speaker 4:          04:55          Do I need my job? Big Deal.

Speaker 1:          05:01          That's where positive piece comes in. Positive piece is the presence of justice and protections that serve the needs of everyone, more or less what Goblin slayer is after, while on the show, it's simply goblins in the real world. It can be a litany of this poverty, famine, disease, corruption, discrimination, crime, and so on. The goblins of the real world, if you will, positive piece. It's especially important for our understanding of violence. For many folks, violence is an interruption to daily life, but for some it's the backdrop against which life takes place. Goblins, slayer can't just chill it. An idyllic farm with cowgirl, which is really what they call her without searching for signs of goblins and fortifying defenses. Unlike the platinum heroes that killed the demon. Lord.

Speaker 1:          05:50          In goblin flavors, view the shape of the world. Guarantees that people are on. Farms will always face gallbladder attacks. That's why goblins slayer doesn't care about the demon. Lord, he's busy burning down Goblin this now that may not seem very peaceful and it's not, but it's a question of conflict prevention and development, so simply by taking care of the Goblin problem in the short term, Goblin slayer starts the process of longterm protection, but it's not just that smaller issues can compound to create an equally crappy reality. For many, the kind of small work that needs to be done is balked at it's grunt work. Everyone wants the glory of killing the demon Lord, but chopping goblins. That's child's play. Even when the demon Lord is gone, the clean up of his armies is below some people

Speaker 5:          06:37          ada, he needed to eat all my money. I told him, boy, he doesn't. So no,

Speaker 1:          06:51          despite being a silver class adventure or Goblin slayer is marked for his choice of missions in the hierarchy of adventuring. He's like if general patent started cleaning latrines, but in the world of Goblin slayer, toilets are going uncleaned because nobody wants to be the janitor, and without clean toilets we might just all die from Colorado, so somebody has to do that work. We can see this sort of thing all over the place. In real life. People take jobs that get all the glory, so doctors researching cancer get all the press while doctors doing routine work to test the water to prevent equally deadly stomach illnesses. Well, not so much. People take jobs that are high paying and high prestigious without much thought for what? As the highest social impact. Even in sports, everyone wants to be the quarterback. Nobody wants to be whatever a left tackle is. Goblins. Slayer wanted to kill dragons as a child and it's not until he sees the dangers of goblins firsthand that he commits himself to his mission. You would just sit and look at q three, Twenty Coca Cola soda still weeks. Now, this is an even bigger problem than it seems for two reasons. First, the stigma against Goblin slang causes many to minimize the threat goblins pose.

Speaker 1:          08:09          Slaying Goblins isn't complicated. You mostly swing swords around and cut off heads. They can even apparently get killed by a strong kick. Now, that doesn't mean it's easy as we see throughout the show, goblins have tricks of their own that can make them very dangerous when they're perceived as a simple problem. However, the people sent to deal with the issue are not qualified because aside from Goblin slayer, civil ranked heroes have quote better things to do,

Speaker 6:          08:35          quarter to sunken meadow bogus I with them in it,

Speaker 1:          08:45          and that's how you ended up with situations like this, so unqualified heroes get murdered and the goblins stick around. That sucks, which leads us to our second issue. The problem worsens as the goblins breed and become even more dangerous, worse yet, major heroes don't want to get involved because they think goblins are nothing but pes or they don't want to admit that goblins or a real threat because it would be embarrassing to say so enter the sword. Maybe she is the ass kicking. Super leader of priestesses religion. She even slayed the original demon Lord with her big awesome sword.

Speaker 2:          09:18          Is there a name?

Speaker 1:          09:22          She hires Goblins, slayer and his friends to deal with some goblins under the city who are presumably responsible for some murders, but soon becomes obvious that she herself committed some light murder to have the goblins taken care of by someone else.

Speaker 2:          09:35          That's good. That's good. I could assign a top

Speaker 1:          09:42          because she was afraid after her own traumatic running and admitting that you're afraid of goblins after defeating a demon. Lord is definitely against the unspoken hero code. Goblin attacks can leave people in a constant state of fear and anxiety. Those feelings contribute to an already difficult life for many, and that again raises the stakes of positive piece. Dealing with goblins doesn't necessarily change the material conditions of life, but definitely the psychological ones, goblins slayers. Intervention to kill the goblins and talked to the sword maiden about her fears has a substantial effect on her wellbeing. She no longer has goblin nightmares.

Speaker 2:          10:21          You mainly use English 30 minutes.

Speaker 1:          10:25          What's so interesting about this take on fantasy is what we can expect it will do to the narrative. Normally, as the series goes on, the threads get bigger and scarier. We even see this in standalone episodes when we start off with regular goblins and then the conflict escalates to an ogre, but since the demon Lord has already gotten snowed ears, your toes and the goblins slayers and 10th on only slaying goblins. What creative ways will they come up with to up the stakes? Perhaps we'll see more ambiguity regarding the Goblin threat with this false sense of security taking hold across the land. The goblin problem will probably remain in obscurity for most, but as we saw at the end of the last episode, it's about to hit Goblin slayer much closer to home. So is the story. You're gonna stay on Goblins or are we cruising toward a collision with something?
