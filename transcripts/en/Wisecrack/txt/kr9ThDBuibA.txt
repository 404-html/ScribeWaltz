Speaker 1:          00:02          Hey, why is cracked so over the years you guys know it's been our mission to use the lens of philosophy, literature, and the humanities to achieve a greater appreciation of art and hopefully to enrich people's lives, but today we're doing something a little bit different. This is ground zero of science content on wisecracking. For that I decided to bring on someone who's a lot smarter than I am when it comes to science.

Speaker 2:          00:23          Helen. Hey guys.

Speaker 1:          00:25          So today we are starting with a wise crack favorite to see if we can connect some of the philosophical themes that we talk about with existing research and neuroscience, biology and psychology. So today we're starting with one punch man. Also want to give a quick shout out to brilliant.org for sponsoring this video. Thank you guys. So anyway, I'm gonna. Give it over to Helen.

Speaker 2:          00:44          Wait, so is it hey wise crack Helen here.

Speaker 1:          00:48          So it would be. Hey wisecrack held here. You got to go. It's one, two, three up, down.

Speaker 2:          00:53          Hey. Wise crack. Helen here. There we go. Now say it faster. Hey. Wise, crack Helen here and today we're putting the boldest bad ass in the universe under the microscope in one punch, man. Our protagonists site trauma is a salary man turned hero who possesses no special powers apart from the strength he's gained through his intense training regimen. 100 pushups, 100 sit ups and 100 squats that a 10 kilometer run. Do it every single day, and now he can defeat every enemy with a single punch. Sounds cool, right? Well, this lack of challenge leave site to my board, detached and unfulfilled. Oh they took was one punch. Dreaming of becoming the best at anything is pretty much being human one on one, but the site is dilemma. Reflect our growing scientific understanding of how humans can live a satisfying life. Welcome to this special wise crack condition on the science of one punch man, and as always, spoilers ahead with no real challenge. Cytoma loses his enthusiasm for battle much to the irritation of his rivals. He blows them off. Repairs to witness the true power.

Speaker 2:          02:07          I got dirt and my special pans place. Hey, are you even listening? Insults them. What a let down. I was pretty excited to see the battle suits I'd been hearing about, but the design is pretty lame and all they do is give you superhuman strength and occasionally has the audacity to yawn during a fight. Does that really seem like sysomos enjoying himself? As we've mentioned before, philosophers like Masa Hero Morioka have argued that challenge is a necessary component of a meaningful life, and then as our lives become more efficient and therefore less challenging, our mental health pays the price

Speaker 3:          02:41          we will continue to ride until food, clothing, and shelter are provided free of charge. To those who do not work

Speaker 2:          02:47          sounds pretty boring. It turns out this isn't just philosophical. Grandstanding science suggests there's a biological basis for the idea. The challenging ourselves is good for us and it's not just our mental health that's at stake. If we always take it easy. Neuroscientists, Dr. Mark Madsen argues that the pervasiveness of what he calls unchallenging lifestyles prevents us from activating adaptive stress responses. A series of changes that take place at the cellular level when an organism is exposed to danger. Here's how it works. Let's say you're walking down the alley. When you encounter a giant Kelp and crusted monster, your brain activates your sympathetic nervous system or the part of the nervous system that turns on the fight or flight response by sending out a molecule from the hypothalamus and almond shaped area toward the center of the brain. This molecule tells the pituitary gland to send out another molecule which sets off a series of reactions in the adrenal gland above the kidneys.

Speaker 2:          03:41          That ultimately leads to the release of a substance called Cortisol, Aka the stress hormone. It's nickname comes from the fact that it's the main hormone involved in the stress response, and while there's always a certain baseline amount circulating through the bloodstream, those levels increase. When your fight or flight response turns up, that extra quarters all prompts your body to do things like break down sugar to give you energy and numb the pain response so you'd be more likely to fight through an injury. It also turns down the part of your immune system that fights off viruses and certain kinds of bacteria. This isn't a bad thing. The idea is to push the energy you need to fight infection to other more important tasks that'll help you survive and immediate threat. If this happens now and then it works, kind of like endurance training, your body learns how to respond to acute stress more efficiently, but if it's constant, you can wind up with a botched immune system as your body becomes less sensitive to cortisol. That can lead to chronic inflammation because there's nothing stopping your immune system from running on high, which can lead to a host of other health problems. We might consider dominator of the universe, Lord boroughs, as an exaggerated metaphor for this process,

Speaker 4:          04:44          my species, what the struggle for survival amid the harsh environment of our home repossessed, the ultimate in regenerative ability

Speaker 2:          04:53          are you able to regrow entire limbs is a pretty potent adaptive stress response. A lot of the nuts, so fictional starfish, a well known limb regenerator Yep. Burrells also points out that the extreme strength he exudes and battle is so taxing that it actually shortens his life if he uses it. Too often.

Speaker 4:          05:10          Doing this place is enormous stress on my body. Similar to anaerobic exercise, as a result, it's Jordan's my life, the same

Speaker 2:          05:18          problem humans run into when our fight or flight response goes into overdrive for too long. Scientists like Dr Mattson say humans are evolutionarily adapted to deal with environmental challenges and then not having them on a regular basis, mainly in the form of not enough physical exertion or too little exposure to the natural toxins found in plants can lead to the prolonged inflammatory states that have been linked to everything from Alzheimer's to diabetes to cancer. Inflammation causes changes in DNA and since DNA contains the code for creating all the proteins in your body, Wonky DNA can result in misshape and proteins. Those can go on to screw up hormone regulation and encourage out of control cell growth. In other words, cancer from Dr Matson's perspective without challenges, your body isn't given opportunities to strengthen its defenses that is improved the adoptive stress response, so when something starts to go wrong, it has a hard time fixing it.

Speaker 2:          06:09          Outside of the physical effects, a lack of conflict introduces a similar logic. Operates psychologically will cite them or may not be getting diabetes. He's probably got some issues going on in his brain parts through the show. We can see how enduring challenges can make you more mentally resilient. Let's take genos. He's faced certain challenges that to hasn't faced on what we know from the show site has had it pretty easy. He didn't get into the crime fighting business to avenge the death of his family or bring justice to the oppressed. He just did it for fun fast one. Who are you? Just a guy who's a hero for fun. On the other hand, genesis backstory is much more traumatic. He witnessed the destruction of his hometown and the death of his family at the hands of an out of Control Cyborg. We lived a peaceful and happy life together until that fateful day when a crazy cyborg went out of control and attacked our town.

Speaker 2:          07:00          His experience mirrors that of many other characters in the genre. Gods from Berzerk Aaron from attack on Titan Naruto. A painful childhood is a common denominator throughout anime, Manga and comics in general. So how did these experiences shape the characters? Well, it's pretty complex and often a little stuck on one hand their struggles motivate them or at the very least seem to give them the strength to withstand extremely difficult circumstances. Psychology backs this up. A growing body of research suggests that some people who go through adverse or traumatic experiences as kids are in some ways more resilient than those whose childhoods were relatively carefree. For instance, some individuals who grow up in high stress environments develop unique problem solving skills and are better able to deal with uncertainty and their peers who had it easier. Of course, that doesn't change the fact that there are loads of other issues associated with having a rough childhood like problems with learning and memory and a propensity for being emotionally reactive and there are caveats to the whole what doesn't kill you, makes you stronger idea to research on adults has indicated that those who face the medium number of challenging life events like the death of a loved one or financial difficulties or better able to cope with worry and stress than those who deal with either an unusually low or an unusually high number of such experiences.

Speaker 2:          08:15          It sort of like the goldilocks principle. Optimal adaptation distress is achieved from not having too much exposure, but not too little either. In theory, general says, traumatic experiences may have boosted his ability to handle the emotional whiplash of hero work. There'll being a cyborg definitely helps. He fights to near death in battle and shows up when others don't like when the s class heroes are called in to hold off the media that threatens to wipe out cities eat. Meanwhile, Cytoma meanders through life. He can't even try to swat a mosquito without losing it. Additionally, having something to strive for the coming is powerful. SSNC gives genesis work, meaning a stark contrast with Cytoma who was already at the top of his game.

Speaker 4:          08:57          I'd always dreamed of becoming some, what is this? What's wrong with me? Why does my heart feel so lifeless and empty?

Speaker 2:          09:06          What site to be more satisfied if he had something more meaningful to work towards. Then some bs, superhero classification, and what's the purpose of having a purpose anyway? Is there some kind of biological benefit to leading a meaningful life? Back in 2008, team of researchers published a study on the Japanese concept of picky guy, which roughly translates to a reason for being in it. They asked 43,000 people a simple question, do you have achy guide in your life? By the end of the seven year long study, roughly 95 percent of those who reporting having a sense of icky guy, we're still alive compared to only 83 percent of those who said they did not, regardless of socioeconomic status, psychological factors, lifestyle, or history of illness, the increased mortality risk remained. Most of those who died without a sense that they could guide did so as a result of heart disease, mainly strokes for context. A link between heart disease and a lack of purpose has shown up consistently in other studies. Uh, 2015 roundup of Japanese and American research on the topic been reduced heart disease and those who reported having a sense of meaning in life. Unlike the villains in the series who often have rather legitimate reasons for wanting to destroy humanity

Speaker 4:          10:13          in order to wipe out humanity. Medieval civilization surface given bond Cytoma

Speaker 2:          10:22          is still unsure of is icky guy. How do you even have purpose when you've achieved what people like Genos can only dream of is aimless existence, leaves him prone to depression, irritability, and melancholy. Fluoros has struggled to find his icky guy to his purpose in life was to destroy one world after the next what? After growing so strong that he no longer had worthy adversaries, he found himself board and apathetic a car, told him he could find the opponent that would reignite his passion for battle, so he's been traveling for 20 years to find one when he encounters cytoma. In a sense sight. Tma Is [inaudible] ag guy and give stimulation to my existence. Scientists for years have postulated a relationship between purpose, life satisfaction and resilience. Back in 1946, Dr. Viktor Frankl, a psychiatrist, neurologist, and Holocaust survivor suggested that the societal ills of aggression, addiction, and depression stemmed from an existential vacuum or the idea that one's life and work much purpose in his book.

Speaker 2:          11:19          Man's search for meaning. He describes the psychological impact of daily life in a Nazi concentration camp. He knows that the prisoners who clung onto a sense of purpose, we're the ones most likely to survive writing life has never made unbearable by circumstances, but only by lack of meaning and purpose. Since then, we've seen over and over again that having no sense of meaning in life is associated with a higher risk of addiction, anxiety and depression. On the flip side, having a sense of purpose is associated with lower incidents of these issues. If challenging one's self is key to finding purpose in life and having sort of purpose is necessary for optimal psychological and perhaps even physical health can, we can see why having virtually no competition leave site to a miserable, challenging ourselves can help us find that meaning and improves our wellbeing in other ways too, and in some cases even the hardships we can't control can make us more resilient, which suggests there might be a psychological benefit to seeing them as an opportunity for growth.

Speaker 2:          12:15          So we'll cite them to ever be presented with a real challenge. I wonder if taking out this guy will count as work and if he does will it gives him a much needed sense of passion. We'll just have to wait until season two whenever that is to find out and just to make sure you're being challenged. I'm going to put my money where my mouth is and give you a brain teaser courtesy of brilliant.org. Imagine you're presented with five chocolates to choose from, one of which is poison. You alternate turns with an opponent and during each turn, the current player must choose whether to eat one or two of the remaining chocolates. The player who eats the poisoned chocolate uses. If you're the first player, what moves should you make each turn to when to find out the solution and to find more awesome logic puzzles.
