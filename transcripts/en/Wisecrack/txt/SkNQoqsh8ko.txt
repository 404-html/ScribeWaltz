Speaker 1:          00:00          This video is brought to you by skillshare.

Speaker 2:          00:02          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:06          a wise crack. Jared, again, as you probably know, the Internet is obsessed with fantasy life analysts was wrong. Wife analysts was right. The philosophy of Santos, Hey, wait a second. Even showed up in fortnight, but aside from infinity war grossing more money than the entire GDP of Belize and Josh Brolin being a bad ass. Why is this fill in the most ubiquitous since this dude,

Speaker 1:          00:32          after all, not all diabolic plans get this much internet debate. Oh hell, let's just do it. We always do hijacks Jackson nuclear weapons and hold the world hostage. Well, after a classic wisecrack brainstorm session, I eat unsafe amounts of caffeine. We've come up with a possible answer. It all has to do with the transition from this to this nanos. Welcome Liz. Wise crack edition on this very distinguished Chin and spoilers for infinity war and the comics ahead. It's important to note that the 2018 pianos isn't to fan, knows has always been a comic book fan. I was was created by Jim Starlin in 1973 and issue number 55 of the invincible Ironman, and he immediately became a hit with readers in part due to. Well, the outright weirdness of his cars. You see everything comic book Fan Ost did he did to impress the object of his affection, marvel's personification of death, who appears as a robed female skeleton who doesn't really talk a lot and wouldn't you know it. She's just not into him, but maybe if he defeats one more adventure or conquers one more planet. So you're telling me there's a chance.

Speaker 1:          01:42          Yeah, like his later counterpart Comic Book Vanos is definitely a product of his era. America in the late sixties and early seventies seemed to be infused with debt. Robert Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr were slain in 68, between 1968 and 1972 over a hundred and 30 American commercial airplanes were hijacked with many of these hijackings ending in fatalities. By 1973 over 58,000 American soldiers had died in Vietnam that had infested our culture. Why not have a super villain lust after her? It's not the first time art has lusted after death in many ways. Comic Book Vanos with his obsessive form of Necrophilia hearkens back to an earlier time when obsessions like his were all the rage he fits right in with the capital are romantics of the 19th century. The poets like Lord Byron, John Keats and Percy shelley depth was nature at its most glorious and triumphant, keats himself and used on being half in love with death and it's no surprise that the greatest American poet from this era is Edgar Allen Poe, the man who invented the spirit of hot topic hundreds of years before it manifested itself in every mall across America.

Speaker 1:          02:54          And in this vein, Comic Book Fan. Osu is a romantic 100 percent angsty banjos once the whole universe to feel his pain. But if comic book Fan Ost Living His passion driven emo life dovetailed nicely with be so full sleep heart at seventies, how would he fair? Now, while today's America certainly has its own boogeyman, death isn't really one of them. Sure there's terrorism, but the fears of the information age are more analytical, more driven by endless streams of data, whether it be 24 hour news cycles or 24, our social media feeds, oh God. Just thinking about it gives me a panic attack. So marvel had to augment Thanos. Specifically, they had to tinker with primary motivation, keep him in obsessive lunatic, but changes obsession from death, which is so retro to data retain his distinctive costume and appearance. Sure. Even keep the tire tracks on that sexy Chinet, his Butler bottom eyes, all the fields cinematic banjos in contrast to his four color antecedent is not impulsive at all.

Speaker 1:          03:55          He rarely even raises his voice as befitting to our era. Cinematic Banjos is a rationalist historically rationalism first rose to prominence during the 17th and 18th centuries. This is Galileo pushing back at the church about the movement of the earth around the sun. This is Newton deducing, the three laws of classical mechanics, pascal, furthering our understanding of geometry, the salient furthering our understanding of human anatomy. It's descartes proclaiming, I think therefore I am not. I feel, but I think these are the men and women who pushed against all emotional distraction in order to achieve a higher truth. So Berlin goes about his business with the detachment of a rationalist. It explains how he's able to murder his own daughter for the sake of achieving his utilitarian solution to overpopulation, erases every other man, woman, and child from existence, and justifies it to cold logic. So why this change? Is it just a sign of the times? Well, maybe, but there's also a second reason to highlight the flaws of Tony Stark in his seminal work on literary criticism poetics. Aristotle claims that effective antagonists act not only in opposition to the hero, but also reflect a vital flawed aspect of the hero. This is the literary theory of foils, Hamlet's self righteousness is so complete that it compels him to deceive and kill, but the same could be said of his enemy, Claudius, hey,

Speaker 1:          05:29          you killed my father. Absent Fathers Syndrome leads both Luke skywalker and Darth vader to make some very bad decisions and Sour Mon is little more than Gandalf, fallen from grace. And so when we apply poetics to avengers, infinity, war, we discover why big, bad thing I was had to be a rationalist because our protagonist Tony Stark is one to granted. Tony Stark has his moments of being overtaken with emotion. He begins his first movie as a carefree rich boy arms dealer. Later events shake him out of his comfort zone. So much so that by iron man three, he's so overcome with the emotional aftermath of a near death experience that he's more or less crippled. From there, he ping pongs back to the security of stubborn rational thinking, and it's in this headspace that he creates ultron and advocates for the Sokovia accords documents like that. Documents which exists solely to enforce order or rationalist best friend, which brings us to infinity war.

Speaker 1:          06:25          Remember Tony Solution to defeating Thanos? He's going to secure Dr. strange if he can keep the analysts from acquiring the time stone, the infinity gauntlet can't be completed. It's so mathematical that even Sheldon Cooper would have no. No. Jerry, no more big bang theory jokes. It's an elegant, logical strategy. It is rational and it fails utterly. Of course it does. A need for rational solutions is the vital flawed characteristic that Tony has in common with Vanos. Aristotelian storytelling demands that Tony Fail, but hold on. It's not as if Tony Stark is the only character in the movie. In fact, one could argue that the true beating heart of the mcu belongs instead to captain America himself. Steve Rogers, it Steve's emotional fortitude which finally brings the avengers together. Rescues the winter soldier from darkness and denies the confines of the Sokovia Corps. Steve Rogers is marvel's capital. Our romantic hero is driven by loyalty, honor, and his own principles, romanticism versus rationalism.

Speaker 1:          07:25          It's this age old duality which forms the core of the Tony Stark, Steve Rogers, antagonism from the moment they meet, it forms the foundation of their separate attempts to stop vanos stark. The rationalist tries to out strategize him while Roger's the romantic tries to beat him up with an army and they both. It's not just that they both fail, that's important, but that the only way they can come up with to solve a complicated problem is two diametrically opposed worldviews, rationality, or romanticism. Having to choose between two extremes is a defining characteristic of infinity war. The avengers can either a, let vision live and risk vanos getting the milestone or be killed her best friend and stop Nanos or look at Dr. strangest dilemma. He can either let Tony Stark die and perhaps defeat pianos or give it up and save Tony and let half the world die. He tries to use the time stone as a way to defeat nanosecond.

Speaker 1:          08:21          After exploring 14 million options, only find success once one in 14 million. Dr. Strange then gives up the time stone and save stark. Now we can assume that this rational choice that strange makes is necessary toward that one in 14 million success, but right now it sure looks awful because it allows our villain to win being stuck between option a and option B is stenosis. Whole Shtick, a man who literally control space and time can somehow only think of two outcomes in response to dwindling resources. Let overpopulation run its course through war, famine, and misery, or kill half the world. He couldn't just snap his fingers to make more food, resources or even planets to live on, but as a reflection of modern society, this is exactly the point and perhaps why fantas resonates so much in 2018, as Maggie asked her recently observed in the New York Times, our life expectancy is declined.

Speaker 1:          09:17          Suicide rates have risen. The opioid crisis has worsened. Inequality has grown in confidence in government has fallen when confronted with the enormous problems of our modern world. It seems like every choice is damned if you do damned if you don't work a job that pays, be miserable or work a job you love. Be Poor and miserable. Vote for a Douche or vote for a Turd Sandwich. It seems like in many facets of life, we're given the options of Pepsi and coke, but no RC cola Bago boil on Fox and park or Moxie, and that's the problem with Dan knows when you're a political imagination is so limited and you only have a choice between two things. All the rationality and the world isn't going to help you make progress. In order to do that, we need more imagination.

Speaker 3:          10:03          Whoa,

Speaker 1:          10:06          and what our political imagination is, so she will never experience the joy of Phaco. Is there any escape Hegel road that oftentimes in history the way forward come, so when we take two diametrically opposed things and synthesize them into a fresh approach. This is probably what lays before us in avengers four. This is probably how our heroes will ultimately defeat banjos and saved the universe as they say. When the old tricks fail, you got to come up with new tricks. As always, guys, thanks for watching. Peace
