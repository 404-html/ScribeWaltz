Speaker 1:          00:13          Greetings and welcome to earthling cinema. I am your host Garrick's where ameloid. This week's artifact is spiderman homecoming starring Tom Hollandaise sauce and praised by fans as the installment that bravely made aunt may hot. The film follows teenage earthling, Peter Parker, who is Hashtag blessed with sticky hand powers. One day Peter Fights for playboy billionaire Elon Musk in the civil war, but before Ilan can ulysses s grant him a spot on the avengers. Peter has to prove himself by just sort of stopping crime with no clear deadlines or goals. Fortunately, a garbage man named tombs has been busy selling artists and weapons on etsy and dressing like a bird. Spiders sworn enemies behind water spouts at school. Peter spends his time macking on his crush. Liz chillin with is obligatory ugly fat friend, Ned and macking on his crush. Liz while chatting with is obligatory fat friend Ned afterschool.

Speaker 1:          01:09          He looks for crime only. Define New York City is too safe. That is until tombs is men forget their pin number and have to use a ray gun. They escape, but Peter does manage to blow up a deli. Peter slings back home where ned learns Peter's deepest secret. He still plays with Legos. Oh, Andy Spiderman. That too. When ned coyly implies Peter knows spiderman. He didn't know sweater man. They score tickets to Liz's weeknight ranger, but the party has cut short. When tombs is men sell guns to childish Gumby. Peter Mixes it up by using all the same tactics and gets dropped on his head like my son relax. He was a baby armed with a ninth grade education. Ned and Peter decrypted Doodad and Geo locate tunes to Washington DC, the criminal capital of the universe. Peter gets a rematch with Birdman, but ends up in an Amazon prime warehouse where he hits it off with his ostp.

Speaker 1:          02:05          Samantha. So where would you like to take me tonight? It's really nice to have somebody to talk to. Speaking of hitting it off, ned turns the Doodad into a bomb causing an explosion in the monument to Washington's penis. Peter Saves his classmates heroically costing the taxpayers millions. Back in the big apple store, Peter Interrogates Childish Gumby without a warrant. Since this is America, he tells him to check the ocean bus where tunes goes. Rip Ship. Ilan glues the ship back together, but takes back his suit. Leaving Peter to walk home naked. Peter Asks Liz to homecoming, get it. Of course you don't, but when he gets to her house, a shocking Pepsi twist is revealed. Birdman is Liz's dad who's anti spider kill you and everybody love and pro gun. Since it's act three, Peter Decides to stop bird man's latest scheme, robbing an airplane full of avengers. Merge tombs tries the old, I'm going to drop a building on your face trick, but Peter Remembers he has super strength and thoughts is planned by crashing the plane into an area full of tourists having utterly reckless his life.

Speaker 1:          03:10          Peter says goodbye. Ilan offers peter a job at tesla, but peter declines. Oh yeah. Aunt may was in this spiderman homecoming marries the superhero action shondra and the teen comedy genre with a license at got online. The film is stylized like John Hughes Jones, both through homages to Ferris Bueller doesn't go to college pretty in Pinko and the one about breakfast and through its themes of teenagers exploring identity, romance, and hats, it gives me confidence through the lens of a kid growing up. The film updates the Sony Spiderman ethos with great power comes great responsibility and 10 more reboots. Usually this is interpreted as meaning that since Peter has great power, he has the obligation to use it for the utmost good of society. But homecoming inverts this by questioning whether the young Peter is responsible enough to wield great power. I know anything. What do you want me to do?

Speaker 1:          04:04          I think you've done in the beginning, Peter is impulsive and fails to think through the consequences of his use of power, not so different from the criminals who sell nuclear weapons to people without conducting a background check. He considers using his power for frivolous means such as crashing Liz's party as Spiderman for the gram and jail breaking his suit before reading up on Windows Vista. His father figure Ilan has to repeatedly swoop in and clean up his mess, usually in a tesla, ultimately taking away a suit so he can dry clean it. It's only when Peter realizes that his actions make things explode all the time that he grows up. Ironically realizing he is not ready to wield such power until the sql spiderman home depot. In a note of intertextual irony, Michael Keaton appears as an avian villain on the heels of 2014 Oscar Darling Birdman or the unexpected value of shooting off your nose in it.

Speaker 1:          04:59          Keaton's character falls into obscurity after starring in a superhero franchise, much as Keaton did after his starring role in Batman, although who could forget Jack Frost, literally every human after they lobotomized it from their brains. This role becomes an ironic completion of Birdman and that the film made Keaton relevant enough to return to lucrative franchises and play the underdog to mega stars like Robert Downey Jr and 16 time Oscar winner Zendaya for earthlink cinema.
