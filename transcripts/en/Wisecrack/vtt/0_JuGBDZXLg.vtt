1
00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.060
<v Speaker 1>I think we should make a distinction </v>
<v Speaker 1>between Islam and Muslims.</v>

2
00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.260
<v Speaker 1>What I'm trying to do is to say all over</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world,</v>

3
00:00:10.261 --> 00:00:13.200
<v Speaker 1>we can identify with each other as human</v>
<v Speaker 1>beings.</v>

4
00:00:13.201 --> 00:00:17.210
<v Speaker 1>That is the basic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

5
00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:18.563
<v Speaker 1>glue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fact that you are an individual </v>

6
00:00:20.311 --> 00:00:22.320
<v Speaker 1>human being and I'm an individual human </v>
<v Speaker 1>being.</v>

7
00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:23.453
<v Speaker 1>That's what's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's where our common commonality or </v>

8
00:00:27.271 --> 00:00:31.950
<v Speaker 1>common strength lies in and common </v>
<v Speaker 1>interest Islam.</v>

9
00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.980
<v Speaker 1>If we view it as one of the philosophies</v>
<v Speaker 1>are political theories or ideas produced</v>

10
00:00:39.181 --> 00:00:43.500
<v Speaker 1>by human beings throughout history,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just one of them and view,</v>

11
00:00:43.501 --> 00:00:44.610
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>scrutinize it,</v>

12
00:00:44.611 --> 00:00:48.000
<v Speaker 1>criticize it as we have done with all </v>
<v Speaker 1>other doctrines,</v>

13
00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.920
<v Speaker 1>religious or secular,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

14
00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:53.663
<v Speaker 1>then we may be able from the West.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I'm using [inaudible] as in someone </v>

15
00:00:58.051 --> 00:00:58.884
<v Speaker 1>who is Westernized,</v>
<v Speaker 1>convinced Muslims to make a different </v>

16
00:01:02.761 --> 00:01:03.594
<v Speaker 1>choice and to reform their faith fast by</v>
<v Speaker 1>acknowledging that there are things </v>

17
00:01:07.771 --> 00:01:08.670
<v Speaker 1>wrong with their faith.</v>

18
00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.240
<v Speaker 1>So our goal should not be to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to preserve Islam.</v>

19
00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.430
<v Speaker 1>Our goal should be the common human,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

20
00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:18.510
<v Speaker 1>we are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we are human.</v>

21
00:01:18.511 --> 00:01:19.344
<v Speaker 1>So Muslims are humans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not fast meal point just as a </v>

22
00:01:21.511 --> 00:01:26.490
<v Speaker 1>baby in Pakistan or in Saudi Arabia or </v>
<v Speaker 1>in Yemen or in a Muslim community here.</v>

23
00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:31.680
<v Speaker 1>If we emphasize that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then I think we can make that change.</v>

24
00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:32.963
<v Speaker 1>And that involves two things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That involves learning to distinguish </v>

25
00:01:39.661 --> 00:01:42.270
<v Speaker 1>between who is an enemy and who is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>friend.</v>

26
00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:46.410
<v Speaker 1>But before you decide who is an enemy </v>
<v Speaker 1>and who is a friend,</v>

27
00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.380
<v Speaker 1>you yourself have to decide what do you </v>
<v Speaker 1>stand for?</v>

28
00:01:49.381 --> 00:01:54.060
<v Speaker 1>What are your own set of ideas that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>feel as superior to that of Islam?</v>

29
00:01:54.061 --> 00:01:54.894
<v Speaker 1>And Are you willing to defend and die </v>
<v Speaker 1>for your own ideas of freedom and </v>

30
00:01:58.951 --> 00:01:59.784
<v Speaker 1>humanity and humanism as much as the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fanatics are willing to die for their </v>

31
00:02:02.971 --> 00:02:03.390
<v Speaker 1>own.</v>

32
00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:08.340
<v Speaker 1>There is no consensus in the United </v>
<v Speaker 1>States on who the enemies and whether to</v>

33
00:02:08.341 --> 00:02:12.040
<v Speaker 1>really say it's Islam or it's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>perversion of a form of Islams.</v>

34
00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.883
<v Speaker 1>It will have is himself as in what was </v>
<v Speaker 1>it basically just slam a who should we </v>

35
00:02:16.981 --> 00:02:20.340
<v Speaker 1>ally with strategically?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

36
00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:21.233
<v Speaker 1>in other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the approach has been very much </v>

37
00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:23.663
<v Speaker 1>strategic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are people in the United States </v>

38
00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:30.240
<v Speaker 1>including this administration who are </v>
<v Speaker 1>waking up to the fact that it is,</v>

39
00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:31.163
<v Speaker 1>there is a battle of ideas going on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're too shy to voice what the </v>

40
00:02:34.621 --> 00:02:37.500
<v Speaker 1>ideas are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

41
00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:38.513
<v Speaker 1>another point of criticism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's not only towards this </v>

42
00:02:41.311 --> 00:02:42.144
<v Speaker 1>administration,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I've seen how it all over the place </v>

43
00:02:44.551 --> 00:02:45.384
<v Speaker 1>is just this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this desire to avoid Saudi Arabia as a </v>

44
00:02:47.971 --> 00:02:51.500
<v Speaker 1>culprit of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

45
00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:52.433
<v Speaker 1>the states that's not only financing </v>
<v Speaker 1>terrorism but also financing the </v>

46
00:02:57.331 --> 00:02:58.164
<v Speaker 1>ideology behind the terror act.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was a mistake to declare a </v>

47
00:03:02.231 --> 00:03:03.100
<v Speaker 1>war on terror.</v>

48
00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:06.040
<v Speaker 1>Tara is just a tactic and it shows how </v>
<v Speaker 1>much,</v>

49
00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:10.840
<v Speaker 1>how strategic the whole approach is to </v>
<v Speaker 1>watch what's going on.</v>

50
00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:13.173
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>another mistake both on both sides of </v>

51
00:03:15.941 --> 00:03:19.570
<v Speaker 1>the Atlantic is lit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we just appeased them.</v>

52
00:03:19.571 --> 00:03:23.290
<v Speaker 1>If you just understand what they want </v>
<v Speaker 1>from us and we give it to them,</v>

53
00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:28.180
<v Speaker 1>they might not be so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so bad to us.</v>

54
00:03:28.181 --> 00:03:29.014
<v Speaker 1>So they might forget what the mates,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think those are mistakes that were </v>

55
00:03:31.511 --> 00:03:32.950
<v Speaker 1>made.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But again,</v>

56
00:03:32.951 --> 00:03:35.530
<v Speaker 1>I'll come back to the distinction </v>
<v Speaker 1>between Europe and America.</v>

57
00:03:35.531 --> 00:03:40.480
<v Speaker 1>And it seems as if America is learning </v>
<v Speaker 1>much faster than Europe and my learning,</v>

58
00:03:40.481 --> 00:03:43.300
<v Speaker 1>I mean waking up to the fact that it is </v>
<v Speaker 1>Islam,</v>

59
00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:44.373
<v Speaker 1>not necessarily all Muslims,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but Islamism set of ideas and that </v>

60
00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:53.410
<v Speaker 1>that's kind of mean military.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean very disastrous military action,</v>

61
00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:58.530
<v Speaker 1>which is for every politician is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>terrible decision to take to say,</v>

62
00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:02.470
<v Speaker 1>we are going tall,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we are going to do something destructive</v>

63
00:04:02.471 --> 00:04:04.900
<v Speaker 1>or we're going to take an unpopular </v>
<v Speaker 1>action.</v>

64
00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:09.490
<v Speaker 1>And American seem to be much more </v>
<v Speaker 1>courageous in making that decision.</v>

65
00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:10.383
<v Speaker 1>They did in the student the Second World</v>
<v Speaker 1>War and later then the Europeans who </v>

66
00:04:15.611 --> 00:04:16.444
<v Speaker 1>have I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that European data ship at the </v>

67
00:04:21.251 --> 00:04:22.990
<v Speaker 1>point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this point is fairly self district,</v>

68
00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:26.800
<v Speaker 1>and I say this because of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the approach to Iran.</v>

69
00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:35.843
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
