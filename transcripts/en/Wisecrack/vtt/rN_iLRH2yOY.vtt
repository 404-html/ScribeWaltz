<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wise crack jared,</v>

2
00:00:04.151 --> 00:00:04.984
<v Speaker 1>as always,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so ubisoft recently reached out to us </v>

3
00:00:06.881 --> 00:00:07.714
<v Speaker 1>about doing something for the newly </v>
<v Speaker 1>remastered version of assassin's creed </v>

4
00:00:10.091 --> 00:00:13.090
<v Speaker 1>rogue for ps four and xbox one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Luckily for them,</v>

5
00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:13.953
<v Speaker 1>we've gotten a lot of assassin's creed </v>
<v Speaker 1>requests over the years and luckily for </v>

6
00:00:17.201 --> 00:00:18.034
<v Speaker 1>us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rogue has a unique perspective on the </v>

7
00:00:19.661 --> 00:00:20.494
<v Speaker 1>eternal struggle between the assassins </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the templars and how it relates to </v>

8
00:00:23.141 --> 00:00:26.320
<v Speaker 1>the complicated nature of freedom </v>
<v Speaker 1>throughout the series.</v>

9
00:00:26.321 --> 00:00:28.990
<v Speaker 1>The value of freedom is placed above all</v>
<v Speaker 1>else.</v>

10
00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:31.120
<v Speaker 1>How are we in shall freedom public human</v>
<v Speaker 1>race,</v>

11
00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:31.983
<v Speaker 1>the assassins were told are fighting the</v>
<v Speaker 1>good fight against those devious 10 </v>

12
00:00:34.501 --> 00:00:37.420
<v Speaker 1>players who are trying to rule the world</v>
<v Speaker 1>with an iron fist.</v>

13
00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:38.373
<v Speaker 1>While freedom is nearly universally </v>
<v Speaker 1>celebrated in society and Media Qb </v>

14
00:00:42.461 --> 00:00:44.140
<v Speaker 1>legally safe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>William Wallace knockoff.</v>

15
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:45.833
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

16
00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:48.093
<v Speaker 1>Through which protagonists Shay Cormac,</v>
<v Speaker 1>assassin's creed rogue asked an </v>

17
00:00:50.531 --> 00:00:54.730
<v Speaker 1>interesting and unique question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When does freedom go too far?</v>

18
00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:55.360
<v Speaker 1>Welcome,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Liz.</v>

19
00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:57.070
<v Speaker 1>Wise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>crack condition on assassin's creed,</v>

20
00:00:57.071 --> 00:00:58.930
<v Speaker 1>rogue remastered,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and as always,</v>

21
00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:00.850
<v Speaker 1>minor spoilers ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First,</v>

22
00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:01.713
<v Speaker 1>a quick recap rope takes place around </v>
<v Speaker 1>the numerically challenged seven years </v>

23
00:01:05.291 --> 00:01:08.290
<v Speaker 1>war and somewhere between black flag and</v>
<v Speaker 1>assassin's creed.</v>

24
00:01:08.291 --> 00:01:10.370
<v Speaker 1>Three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we follow fledgling assassin.</v>

25
00:01:10.371 --> 00:01:11.204
<v Speaker 1>Shay Cormac,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a troublemaker who begins to question </v>

26
00:01:13.301 --> 00:01:15.010
<v Speaker 1>the assassin brotherhoods,</v>
<v Speaker 1>methods,</v>

27
00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:15.900
<v Speaker 1>guards watching</v>

28
00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:20.900
<v Speaker 3>to his dad looked disappointed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sick of the way that looks it would have</v>

29
00:01:23.281 --> 00:01:24.750
<v Speaker 3>been dead in a month.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anyway,</v>

30
00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:25.883
<v Speaker 1>he continues to struggle with defending </v>
<v Speaker 1>his creed until halfway through the </v>

31
00:01:28.891 --> 00:01:31.020
<v Speaker 1>game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's given an assignment to find a piece</v>

32
00:01:31.021 --> 00:01:35.420
<v Speaker 1>of ed or an ancient objects had to </v>
<v Speaker 1>bestow God like power and wisdom because</v>

33
00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.240
<v Speaker 1>pieces of Eden,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a powerful relics.</v>

34
00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:40.223
<v Speaker 1>When Shay tries to retrieve it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he triggers the infamous Lisbon </v>

35
00:01:42.511 --> 00:01:45.630
<v Speaker 1>earthquake of 1755 that killed </v>
<v Speaker 1>thousands.</v>

36
00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:48.043
<v Speaker 1>Despite what's happened in Haiti,</v>
<v Speaker 1>happened in Portugal or greater </v>

37
00:01:51.391 --> 00:01:52.950
<v Speaker 1>earthquake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thousands,</v>

38
00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.490
<v Speaker 1>he confronts the assassins who deny </v>
<v Speaker 1>culpability for the earthquake,</v>

39
00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.530
<v Speaker 1>even though they were aware of the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>

40
00:01:58.531 --> 00:02:01.860
<v Speaker 1>had caused the devastating earthquake in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Puerto Prince five years earlier.</v>

41
00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.690
<v Speaker 1>She argues that over here to this side,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what city funds decks,</v>

42
00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.730
<v Speaker 1>but the assassin say we have the </v>
<v Speaker 1>responsibility,</v>

43
00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:12.150
<v Speaker 1>so shay flees the Brotherhood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>After being injured in his escape,</v>

44
00:02:12.151 --> 00:02:16.110
<v Speaker 1>he's nurse back to health by an elderly </v>
<v Speaker 1>couple who turned out to be templars.</v>

45
00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:20.190
<v Speaker 1>Shay is then recruited by the temp lars </v>
<v Speaker 1>and send to kill his former assassin.</v>

46
00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:22.710
<v Speaker 1>Brethren,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in most assassin's creed games were told</v>

47
00:02:22.711 --> 00:02:23.544
<v Speaker 1>the templars are evil because they </v>
<v Speaker 1>oppose freedom and the assassins are </v>

48
00:02:26.311 --> 00:02:30.210
<v Speaker 1>good because they fight for freedom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is best embodied in their mantra,</v>

49
00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:33.813
<v Speaker 1>but assassin's creed rogue by showing </v>
<v Speaker 1>the inner workings of both sides </v>

50
00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:37.553
<v Speaker 1>explores the paradoxical nature of </v>
<v Speaker 1>freedom and the shortcomings of the </v>

51
00:02:40.711 --> 00:02:42.510
<v Speaker 1>assassins belief system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure,</v>

52
00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:44.910
<v Speaker 1>the assassin seen noble.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean after all,</v>

53
00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:48.390
<v Speaker 1>you don their mantle as you fight </v>
<v Speaker 1>against the corruption of the church and</v>

54
00:02:48.391 --> 00:02:49.224
<v Speaker 1>histories other bad guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but just how benign is the saying when </v>

55
00:02:54.991 --> 00:02:55.824
<v Speaker 1>you consider the events of rogue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the assassins disposition toward </v>

56
00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:01.270
<v Speaker 1>absolute freedom starts looking a bit </v>
<v Speaker 1>questionable.</v>

57
00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:04.720
<v Speaker 1>We can best understand why through the </v>
<v Speaker 1>concept of positive freedom,</v>

58
00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:05.753
<v Speaker 1>positive freedom is the freedom to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>something and to self determine what </v>

59
00:03:09.221 --> 00:03:10.054
<v Speaker 1>that something is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the freedom to choose to blast </v>

60
00:03:12.431 --> 00:03:14.140
<v Speaker 1>weird German techno whenever you want.</v>

61
00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:18.940
<v Speaker 1>That's different than negative freedom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The freedom from certain external forces</v>

62
00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:22.990
<v Speaker 1>like the freedom from your roommate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brad telling you to stop blasting German</v>

63
00:03:22.991 --> 00:03:26.320
<v Speaker 1>techno at 2:00</v>
<v Speaker 1>AM or brad common during your stereo.</v>

64
00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:30.610
<v Speaker 1>The problem with unlimited freedom is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that it often comes in conflict with the</v>

65
00:03:30.611 --> 00:03:31.444
<v Speaker 1>rights and freedoms of others.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While you may be the master of your own </v>

66
00:03:34.061 --> 00:03:34.894
<v Speaker 1>fate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what if your actions limit the freedom </v>

67
00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:37.323
<v Speaker 1>of others?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What if Brad can't be the master of his </v>

68
00:03:39.221 --> 00:03:40.054
<v Speaker 1>own destiny because he hasn't gotten any</v>
<v Speaker 1>sleep after the unceasing onslaught of </v>

69
00:03:43.751 --> 00:03:46.180
<v Speaker 1>Autobahn every night until 2:00</v>
<v Speaker 1>AM,</v>

70
00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:47.313
<v Speaker 1>and if you reject any limitations on </v>
<v Speaker 1>freedom from outside interferences or </v>

71
00:03:50.471 --> 00:03:51.304
<v Speaker 1>negative freedom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's going to step in to help Brad get </v>

72
00:03:53.081 --> 00:03:55.450
<v Speaker 1>some sleep?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If everything is permitted,</v>

73
00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:59.290
<v Speaker 1>then people might not agree with when </v>
<v Speaker 1>and how I want to listen to music.</v>

74
00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:01.390
<v Speaker 1>The temple ours address this problem of </v>
<v Speaker 1>freedom.</v>

75
00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:02.223
<v Speaker 1>By negating it all together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they in essence don't believe in the </v>

76
00:04:05.771 --> 00:04:09.100
<v Speaker 1>value of positive freedom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That people can make their own decisions</v>

77
00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:10.083
<v Speaker 1>or negative freedom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they should be free from despotic </v>

78
00:04:12.371 --> 00:04:14.980
<v Speaker 1>control.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Their philosophy is essentially that the</v>

79
00:04:14.981 --> 00:04:19.090
<v Speaker 1>freedom of one person will always end up</v>
<v Speaker 1>rubbing against someone else's,</v>

80
00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:24.210
<v Speaker 1>and so such freedom must be restricted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Philosopher Isaiah Berlin highlights one</v>

81
00:04:24.281 --> 00:04:25.114
<v Speaker 1>way in which these self determination of</v>
<v Speaker 1>positive freedom can have horrific </v>

82
00:04:28.511 --> 00:04:29.344
<v Speaker 1>results.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Freedom for Berlin can often be defined </v>

83
00:04:31.631 --> 00:04:34.210
<v Speaker 1>collectively with others groups,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tribes,</v>

84
00:04:34.211 --> 00:04:37.360
<v Speaker 1>or even nations can set out to define </v>
<v Speaker 1>their own destiny,</v>

85
00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:39.970
<v Speaker 1>and that's where things get a little </v>
<v Speaker 1>tricky.</v>

86
00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:40.953
<v Speaker 1>Since in the name of collective freedom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many have decided to repress minority </v>

87
00:04:44.321 --> 00:04:45.154
<v Speaker 1>groups.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The German people collectively yearned </v>

88
00:04:46.871 --> 00:04:49.330
<v Speaker 1>for the freedom to determine their </v>
<v Speaker 1>national destiny,</v>

89
00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:50.523
<v Speaker 1>but well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we all know how that turned out for </v>

90
00:04:52.211 --> 00:04:53.044
<v Speaker 1>certain groups in Europe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now obviously the assassins and the </v>

91
00:04:55.061 --> 00:04:58.300
<v Speaker 1>Nazis are about as similar as Mozart and</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fred Durst,</v>

92
00:04:58.360 --> 00:04:59.193
<v Speaker 1>but the assassins are willing to </v>
<v Speaker 1>sacrifice the freedom of some for the </v>

93
00:05:02.141 --> 00:05:03.970
<v Speaker 1>sake of freedom for everybody.</v>

94
00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:05.103
<v Speaker 1>If we're all free to do whatever the </v>
<v Speaker 1>hell we want and the assassins don't </v>

95
00:05:07.841 --> 00:05:08.674
<v Speaker 1>mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Earthquakes killing thousands then is </v>

96
00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:13.000
<v Speaker 1>absolute freedom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really the ultimate good.</v>

97
00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:14.013
<v Speaker 1>The templar seemed to understand this </v>
<v Speaker 1>problem with positive freedom with </v>

98
00:05:16.811 --> 00:05:20.710
<v Speaker 1>people being their own masters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they try to actively suppress it.</v>

99
00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:24.370
<v Speaker 1>In the name of a better world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what marvelous destruction captain,</v>

100
00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:25.443
<v Speaker 1>I saw the smoke all the way from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Morrigan that should discourage those </v>

101
00:05:28.271 --> 00:05:29.104
<v Speaker 1>Miss Greens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>New Yolk is safe for now and as rogue </v>

102
00:05:31.801 --> 00:05:32.634
<v Speaker 1>shows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not as misguided as one may </v>

103
00:05:34.541 --> 00:05:35.950
<v Speaker 1>think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Paradoxically,</v>

104
00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:36.813
<v Speaker 1>certain rights and freedoms can be </v>
<v Speaker 1>enhanced with a heavy hand from say the </v>

105
00:05:40.181 --> 00:05:42.700
<v Speaker 1>government or the templars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for instance,</v>

106
00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:46.150
<v Speaker 1>by limiting someone's freedom to enslave</v>
<v Speaker 1>another person,</v>

107
00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:48.730
<v Speaker 1>logging in states a better version of </v>
<v Speaker 1>freedom,</v>

108
00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:49.623
<v Speaker 1>not predicated on owning other humans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We see this conundrum in other </v>

109
00:05:52.871 --> 00:05:53.704
<v Speaker 1>assassin's creed games such as black </v>
<v Speaker 1>flag where the British templarios </v>

110
00:05:56.431 --> 00:05:57.680
<v Speaker 1>cracked down the pirates.</v>

111
00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:02.210
<v Speaker 1>You play as in the name of safer sees </v>
<v Speaker 1>and liberty for woodby pirate victims.</v>

112
00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:03.283
<v Speaker 1>The templars believe they know best and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that order can be achieved through </v>

113
00:06:05.661 --> 00:06:06.494
<v Speaker 1>guidance and rule.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But this isn't exactly a perfect </v>

114
00:06:08.901 --> 00:06:12.260
<v Speaker 1>ideology either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The total control of individuals for the</v>

115
00:06:12.261 --> 00:06:16.430
<v Speaker 1>sake of greater good can lead to your </v>
<v Speaker 1>typical big brother Dystopian nightmare.</v>

116
00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:17.473
<v Speaker 1>So while causing earthquakes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stealing fortunes and slitting throats </v>

117
00:06:20.631 --> 00:06:25.340
<v Speaker 1>is okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If nothing is the polar opposite is that</v>

118
00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:28.820
<v Speaker 1>we should all be thanking our masters </v>
<v Speaker 1>for living under a Jack boot,</v>

119
00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:30.650
<v Speaker 1>but hey police,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're open about it.</v>

120
00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:31.693
<v Speaker 1>What makes rogue unique is that shade </v>
<v Speaker 1>distances himself from the dogmatic </v>

121
00:06:35.241 --> 00:06:36.074
<v Speaker 1>belief structures that characterize the </v>
<v Speaker 1>protagonists of previous games and </v>

122
00:06:38.890 --> 00:06:41.810
<v Speaker 1>embraces a rationally informed moral </v>
<v Speaker 1>choice,</v>

123
00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:44.900
<v Speaker 1>but the shea make the right choice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well to figure that out.</v>

124
00:06:44.901 --> 00:06:45.734
<v Speaker 1>We'll need help from one of the big dogs</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the European Enlightenment Manual </v>

125
00:06:48.471 --> 00:06:49.304
<v Speaker 1>Count during the enlightenment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>formulated a way to ground morality in </v>

126
00:06:52.731 --> 00:06:57.320
<v Speaker 1>reason instead of religion or custom </v>
<v Speaker 1>known as the categorical imperative.</v>

127
00:06:57.560 --> 00:07:00.020
<v Speaker 1>So let's see how Shay's decision stacks </v>
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>

128
00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:01.033
<v Speaker 1>The first formulation act only according</v>
<v Speaker 1>to that maxim whereby you can will that </v>

129
00:07:04.611 --> 00:07:08.990
<v Speaker 1>it should become a universal law sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>boils down to do unto others.</v>

130
00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:12.890
<v Speaker 1>So if you want to know if killing people</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then searching their bodies for loot</v>

131
00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:13.783
<v Speaker 1>is moral,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should consider what will happen if </v>

132
00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:16.393
<v Speaker 1>everyone follows this rule.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The second is to act in such a way that </v>

133
00:07:19.461 --> 00:07:22.340
<v Speaker 1>you treat humanity never merely as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>means to an end,</v>

134
00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:25.010
<v Speaker 1>but always at the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As an end.</v>

135
00:07:25.070 --> 00:07:28.850
<v Speaker 1>This essentially means that life is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>highest value in and of itself,</v>

136
00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:33.710
<v Speaker 1>so never harm others or exploit them as </v>
<v Speaker 1>a means of achieving some bigger goal.</v>

137
00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:34.753
<v Speaker 1>The final rule says that the will of </v>
<v Speaker 1>every rational beings should be thought </v>

138
00:07:37.701 --> 00:07:38.534
<v Speaker 1>of as a universally legislating will.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This ties the first two together and </v>

139
00:07:42.111 --> 00:07:42.944
<v Speaker 1>suggest that there is a universal reason</v>
<v Speaker 1>or logic that we can all access through </v>

140
00:07:46.881 --> 00:07:48.020
<v Speaker 1>our own rationality.</v>

141
00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:52.640
<v Speaker 1>It also offers a framework that includes</v>
<v Speaker 1>a sense of freedom since every person is</v>

142
00:07:52.641 --> 00:07:53.474
<v Speaker 1>capable of participating in this kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>moral reasoning where without the </v>

143
00:07:56.361 --> 00:07:58.490
<v Speaker 1>dangers of the templars of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>assassins,</v>

144
00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:01.850
<v Speaker 1>where people become freedom list ponds </v>
<v Speaker 1>to their grander plans.</v>

145
00:08:02.060 --> 00:08:05.810
<v Speaker 1>Even if paradoxically freedom is part of</v>
<v Speaker 1>that grander plan.</v>

146
00:08:06.050 --> 00:08:06.883
<v Speaker 1>According to current,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no action or morals are ethical if they </v>

147
00:08:09.741 --> 00:08:13.490
<v Speaker 1>contradict these three rules.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's see how shay scores against the</v>

148
00:08:13.491 --> 00:08:14.324
<v Speaker 1>assassins shade defects because he </v>
<v Speaker 1>believed that by causing an earthquake </v>

149
00:08:17.331 --> 00:08:20.300
<v Speaker 1>and justifying it as part of their </v>
<v Speaker 1>responsibility,</v>

150
00:08:20.450 --> 00:08:23.240
<v Speaker 1>the assassins have done a grave </v>
<v Speaker 1>injustice.</v>

151
00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:27.740
<v Speaker 1>This act violates the first formulation </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it implies killing thousands for</v>

152
00:08:27.741 --> 00:08:31.250
<v Speaker 1>your own end,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which could never be a universal ethical</v>

153
00:08:31.251 --> 00:08:32.690
<v Speaker 1>act.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One point for Shay,</v>

154
00:08:32.870 --> 00:08:33.703
<v Speaker 1>zero for the assassin's the assassin's </v>
<v Speaker 1>are also saying that those lives are </v>

155
00:08:36.981 --> 00:08:39.500
<v Speaker 1>acceptable sacrifices for their greater </v>
<v Speaker 1>goal,</v>

156
00:08:39.710 --> 00:08:40.543
<v Speaker 1>a violation of the second principle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because using people as a means to an </v>

157
00:08:43.521 --> 00:08:45.110
<v Speaker 1>end is a big no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

158
00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:46.333
<v Speaker 1>Another point for Shay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and finally through their belief in </v>

159
00:08:48.831 --> 00:08:49.664
<v Speaker 1>total freedom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the assessments are trampling on </v>

160
00:08:51.471 --> 00:08:52.304
<v Speaker 1>people's legislative will by ignoring </v>
<v Speaker 1>their own agency and literally </v>

161
00:08:55.531 --> 00:08:59.230
<v Speaker 1>destroying their homes and autonomous </v>
<v Speaker 1>lives which contradicts const.</v>

162
00:08:59.270 --> 00:09:02.310
<v Speaker 1>Third formulation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shay wants no part of it,</v>

163
00:09:02.610 --> 00:09:06.000
<v Speaker 1>so three points for Shay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>zero for the assassins.</v>

164
00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:06.953
<v Speaker 1>So what can we learn from shades </v>
<v Speaker 1>decision that fighting for freedom is </v>

165
00:09:10.441 --> 00:09:13.410
<v Speaker 1>not so simple by pursuing their own </v>
<v Speaker 1>freedom,</v>

166
00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:15.960
<v Speaker 1>the assassins have destroyed the </v>
<v Speaker 1>freedoms of others,</v>

167
00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:19.770
<v Speaker 1>but by rejecting the indoctrinated </v>
<v Speaker 1>philosophy of nothingness,</v>

168
00:09:21.910 --> 00:09:26.460
<v Speaker 1>Jay could be among the few ethical </v>
<v Speaker 1>heroes of the assassins creed franchise.</v>

169
00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:28.510
<v Speaker 1>Unfortunately for Shay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the temple,</v>

170
00:09:28.511 --> 00:09:32.820
<v Speaker 1>ours aren't exactly model citizens </v>
<v Speaker 1>either in the name of regulating freedom</v>

171
00:09:32.821 --> 00:09:33.654
<v Speaker 1>for the greater good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the templars do plenty of deplorable </v>

172
00:09:36.121 --> 00:09:36.954
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We see them helping local people in </v>

173
00:09:38.401 --> 00:09:39.630
<v Speaker 1>various places.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

174
00:09:39.631 --> 00:09:40.464
<v Speaker 1>let us use some of that money for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>good of the city and stopping the </v>

175
00:09:42.751 --> 00:09:45.450
<v Speaker 1>assassins from committing what amounts </v>
<v Speaker 1>to a war crime.</v>

176
00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:48.450
<v Speaker 1>There is an abandoned factory nearby,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how dangerous poison,</v>

177
00:09:48.690 --> 00:09:49.523
<v Speaker 1>but we also see them lie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maim and kill in the name of their own </v>

178
00:09:52.651 --> 00:09:53.790
<v Speaker 1>creed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In the end,</v>

179
00:09:53.850 --> 00:09:54.683
<v Speaker 1>the same sense of moral dubiousness </v>
<v Speaker 1>follows the templars as much as the </v>

180
00:09:58.051 --> 00:09:58.884
<v Speaker 1>assassins.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I am issued new recruits burdened </v>

181
00:10:01.410 --> 00:10:04.320
<v Speaker 1>with regrets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I tell them the surest way to lose them.</v>

182
00:10:05.100 --> 00:10:09.660
<v Speaker 1>He's with gunpowder with them both </v>
<v Speaker 1>contradicting constant parative by using</v>

183
00:10:09.661 --> 00:10:13.710
<v Speaker 1>people as a means to their own ends and </v>
<v Speaker 1>killing those who stand in their way.</v>

184
00:10:14.040 --> 00:10:17.700
<v Speaker 1>Assassin's creed rogues more nuanced </v>
<v Speaker 1>exploration of freedom,</v>

185
00:10:17.730 --> 00:10:22.200
<v Speaker 1>good and evil is a welcome addition to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the series Shay's decision to betray the</v>

186
00:10:22.201 --> 00:10:25.080
<v Speaker 1>assassins,</v>
<v Speaker 1>brings the philosophies of both factions</v>

187
00:10:25.081 --> 00:10:28.980
<v Speaker 1>under scrutiny and makes the player view</v>
<v Speaker 1>each in an entirely new life.</v>

188
00:10:29.190 --> 00:10:32.130
<v Speaker 1>Was this moral ambivalence about freedom</v>
<v Speaker 1>always there.</v>

189
00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:34.620
<v Speaker 1>Have we been playing as the bad guys?</v>
<v Speaker 1>All along,</v>

190
00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:35.633
<v Speaker 1>here's to hoping.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This complex question gets explored in </v>

191
00:10:37.621 --> 00:10:39.660
<v Speaker 1>future installments,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but until then,</v>
