4
00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:09.903
<v Speaker 1>Hey wisecrack jared here today we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about an Amazon and she has </v>

5
00:00:12.901 --> 00:00:15.810
<v Speaker 1>nothing to do with an endangered plant </v>
<v Speaker 1>species or free two day shipping.</v>

6
00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:18.990
<v Speaker 1>Wonder woman wasn't just the mega box </v>
<v Speaker 1>office hit of the summer.</v>

7
00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:19.883
<v Speaker 1>The film and its eponymous hero have </v>
<v Speaker 1>become one of 2017 biggest cultural </v>

8
00:00:23.221 --> 00:00:26.550
<v Speaker 1>icons and surprise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have something to say about it.</v>

9
00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.970
<v Speaker 1>Now some have called areas a pretty lack</v>
<v Speaker 1>luster villain,</v>

10
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:30.833
<v Speaker 1>but his conflict with Diana is pretty </v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting compared to most superhero </v>

11
00:00:34.171 --> 00:00:35.004
<v Speaker 1>villains who want to just rule the world</v>
<v Speaker 1>or ruled world or rule as guard or rule </v>

12
00:00:38.791 --> 00:00:39.624
<v Speaker 1>the universe and part of what makes this</v>
<v Speaker 1>Greek God family drama so cool is that </v>

13
00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:43.883
<v Speaker 1>aries doesn't just blindly hate Diana.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There clash over the nature and fate of </v>

14
00:00:47.701 --> 00:00:48.534
<v Speaker 1>humanity is well pretty philosophical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so get ready to be lassoed by the truth </v>

15
00:00:52.351 --> 00:00:53.184
<v Speaker 1>in this wise crack addition on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>philosophy of wonder woman and cue the </v>

16
00:00:56.311 --> 00:00:57.144
<v Speaker 1>sirens.</v>

17
00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:03.050
<v Speaker 1>One of the central conflicts of wonder </v>
<v Speaker 1>woman is do humans deserve to be saved?</v>

18
00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:04.063
<v Speaker 1>This makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Since the titular characters from an </v>

19
00:01:05.841 --> 00:01:06.674
<v Speaker 1>island of warrior women who exist solely</v>
<v Speaker 1>to save humans from destruction at the </v>

20
00:01:10.131 --> 00:01:12.020
<v Speaker 1>hand of aries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the God of war.</v>

21
00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:14.690
<v Speaker 1>But as it turns out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you've lived in a tropical paradise</v>

22
00:01:14.691 --> 00:01:16.580
<v Speaker 1>with no boys allowed for a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 1>millennia,</v>

23
00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:19.700
<v Speaker 1>you might decide that humans aren't </v>
<v Speaker 1>really worth the effort.</v>

24
00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.170
<v Speaker 1>View's great demand to be Justin Wise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>strong and passionate.</v>

25
00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:25.200
<v Speaker 1>That was a story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Diane,</v>

26
00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.340
<v Speaker 1>much of Diana's struggle is wrapped up </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the question of what it means to save</v>

27
00:01:29.341 --> 00:01:31.710
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She waivers between a sense of duty,</v>

28
00:01:31.711 --> 00:01:35.720
<v Speaker 1>a sense of caring and a moment of great </v>
<v Speaker 1>a apathy they done deserve our help.</v>

29
00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:41.190
<v Speaker 1>It's not about meanwhile Erin is fully </v>
<v Speaker 1>committed to the belief that humans suck</v>

30
00:01:41.691 --> 00:01:42.524
<v Speaker 1>a fat bag of popsicles and deserve not </v>
<v Speaker 1>only abandonment but also to die </v>

31
00:01:45.861 --> 00:01:49.300
<v Speaker 1>painfully via chemical weapons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Area's developed a weapon.</v>

32
00:01:49.301 --> 00:01:50.134
<v Speaker 1>The worst ever device.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Diana's big hero statement of the film </v>

33
00:01:52.721 --> 00:01:57.721
<v Speaker 1>is in response to areas his claim that </v>
<v Speaker 1>she responds,</v>

34
00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.000
<v Speaker 2>it's not about deserve,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not what you believe.</v>

35
00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:08.363
<v Speaker 1>We believe that line is confusing is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but instead of dismissing it as bad </v>

36
00:02:12.301 --> 00:02:14.490
<v Speaker 1>writing and good old wise cracking and </v>
<v Speaker 1>fashion,</v>

37
00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:16.860
<v Speaker 1>let's pull it apart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now before we get the Diana,</v>

38
00:02:16.861 --> 00:02:19.350
<v Speaker 1>we have to understand what she's </v>
<v Speaker 1>responding to.</v>

39
00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:23.520
<v Speaker 1>Areas is belief that humans are </v>
<v Speaker 1>worthless and can't have nice things.</v>

40
00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.920
<v Speaker 1>Aries is claiming the film has two </v>
<v Speaker 1>parts,</v>

41
00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.963
<v Speaker 1>one that humans deserve to be punished </v>
<v Speaker 1>and to that they don't deserve Diana's </v>

42
00:02:30.631 --> 00:02:31.464
<v Speaker 1>help.</v>

43
00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.973
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

44
00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:41.890
<v Speaker 1>The first one is a question of something</v>
<v Speaker 1>called retribute of justice.</v>

45
00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:42.843
<v Speaker 1>Basically the theory that argues that </v>
<v Speaker 1>people who do bad things should go to </v>

46
00:02:45.401 --> 00:02:46.234
<v Speaker 1>jail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what informs areas as retribute of </v>

47
00:02:48.131 --> 00:02:48.964
<v Speaker 1>mission to destroy humanity?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He believes that humans are by nature </v>

48
00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:52.833
<v Speaker 1>evil</v>

49
00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:58.550
<v Speaker 3>and always will be weak,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cruel,</v>

50
00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:03.420
<v Speaker 3>selfish,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and capable of the greatest harvest.</v>

51
00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:04.493
<v Speaker 1>This is an essential list view of human </v>
<v Speaker 1>nature that humanity has inherit </v>

52
00:03:07.801 --> 00:03:08.634
<v Speaker 1>properties that make them what they are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so people are doomed to be useless </v>

53
00:03:11.851 --> 00:03:12.684
<v Speaker 1>assholes forever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it makes sense why you'd want to get </v>

54
00:03:14.851 --> 00:03:15.870
<v Speaker 1>rid of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Areas.</v>

55
00:03:15.871 --> 00:03:16.704
<v Speaker 1>His claim is bolstered by the summer of </v>
<v Speaker 1>humanities actions over the last couple </v>

56
00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:21.960
<v Speaker 1>thousand years and that time humans have</v>
<v Speaker 1>done a lot.</v>

57
00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:23.003
<v Speaker 1>They genocide it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A bunch of people destroyed the </v>

58
00:03:24.661 --> 00:03:26.970
<v Speaker 1>environment and made this Logan Paul </v>
<v Speaker 1>Guy,</v>

59
00:03:26.971 --> 00:03:27.804
<v Speaker 1>famous</v>

60
00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:32.960
<v Speaker 3>mankind ruin bid day by day.</v>

61
00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:37.740
<v Speaker 1>So that's the first part of areas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His claim.</v>

62
00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:38.783
<v Speaker 1>Now for the second one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one that is much more central to Diana </v>

63
00:03:41.491 --> 00:03:42.324
<v Speaker 1>and the film's Arc,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the question of who deserves to be </v>

64
00:03:44.251 --> 00:03:46.650
<v Speaker 1>saved,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if it's from their own kind.</v>

65
00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:47.633
<v Speaker 1>This is distributive justice in aries </v>
<v Speaker 1>calculation being saved from death is </v>

66
00:03:51.481 --> 00:03:55.620
<v Speaker 1>not something that one is entitled to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's something that is distributed based</v>

67
00:03:55.621 --> 00:03:56.454
<v Speaker 1>on merit as shown by the actions of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>individual or in this case the actions </v>

68
00:03:59.761 --> 00:04:01.770
<v Speaker 1>of the groups spanning three plus </v>
<v Speaker 1>Millennia.</v>

69
00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:05.010
<v Speaker 1>This seems to be a pretty common idea </v>
<v Speaker 1>among mortals.</v>

70
00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:06.750
<v Speaker 1>Diane,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his mother Hippolyta tells her,</v>

71
00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:07.883
<v Speaker 1>do not deserve you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This all reflects one popular approach </v>

72
00:04:10.561 --> 00:04:12.930
<v Speaker 1>to distribute of justice called desert </v>
<v Speaker 1>theory,</v>

73
00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:14.760
<v Speaker 1>which are used that people deserve </v>
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>

74
00:04:14.761 --> 00:04:15.600
<v Speaker 1>jobs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>money,</v>

75
00:04:15.601 --> 00:04:16.434
<v Speaker 1>awards based on their actions rather </v>
<v Speaker 1>than on their needs or the benefit it </v>

76
00:04:19.501 --> 00:04:20.880
<v Speaker 1>would bring to society.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

77
00:04:20.881 --> 00:04:21.714
<v Speaker 1>although Diana stays generally </v>
<v Speaker 1>consistent in her desire to help </v>

78
00:04:24.241 --> 00:04:25.074
<v Speaker 1>humanity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the logic behind this choice develops </v>

79
00:04:26.851 --> 00:04:28.260
<v Speaker 1>and changes throughout the film.</v>

80
00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:31.740
<v Speaker 1>And while we see people justifying their</v>
<v Speaker 1>actions with distributed or Richard,</v>

81
00:04:31.741 --> 00:04:34.560
<v Speaker 1>you'd have frameworks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wonder woman goes a different route.</v>

82
00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:39.090
<v Speaker 1>Diana is raised to believe that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>amazons have a sacred duty to stop aries</v>

83
00:04:39.091 --> 00:04:41.670
<v Speaker 1>and defend the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when she sets out for Europe,</v>

84
00:04:41.671 --> 00:04:44.520
<v Speaker 1>she's not doing it because she believes </v>
<v Speaker 1>humans deserve anything.</v>

85
00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:47.550
<v Speaker 1>It's because she has a moral obligation </v>
<v Speaker 1>to help.</v>

86
00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:50.670
<v Speaker 1>This moral obligation carries her </v>
<v Speaker 1>through most of the film.</v>

87
00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:53.550
<v Speaker 1>Even as she watches British general send</v>
<v Speaker 1>soldiers to their debt,</v>

88
00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:56.790
<v Speaker 1>you should be ashamed and Germans taking</v>
<v Speaker 1>villagers as slaves.</v>

89
00:04:56.910 --> 00:04:57.743
<v Speaker 1>But at some point she realizes that </v>
<v Speaker 1>people suck and it wasn't totally areas </v>

90
00:05:01.711 --> 00:05:03.600
<v Speaker 1>his fault that they were bayoneting each</v>
<v Speaker 1>other.</v>

91
00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:07.620
<v Speaker 1>They can stop fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why are they still,</v>

92
00:05:07.621 --> 00:05:08.454
<v Speaker 1>cause I've picked up sensor duty was to </v>
<v Speaker 1>defend the world from aries and not </v>

93
00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:12.713
<v Speaker 1>humans acting on their own accord.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's not really sure where her moral </v>

94
00:05:15.361 --> 00:05:16.770
<v Speaker 1>obligations lie anymore.</v>

95
00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:21.000
<v Speaker 1>All of a sudden her mom's wise words </v>
<v Speaker 1>sound a whole lot wiser.</v>

96
00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:23.980
<v Speaker 1>And my thought was right not to serve </v>
<v Speaker 1>yet.</v>

97
00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:26.640
<v Speaker 1>Diana's faced with a crisis of </v>
<v Speaker 1>conscious.</v>

98
00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:27.533
<v Speaker 1>She's no longer bound by duty and her </v>
<v Speaker 1>knowledge of human atrocities leader to </v>

99
00:05:30.781 --> 00:05:34.890
<v Speaker 1>the conclusion that humans do not merit </v>
<v Speaker 1>her help as a matter of justice either.</v>

100
00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:38.250
<v Speaker 1>Although Diana makes it less obvious </v>
<v Speaker 1>than areas does.</v>

101
00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:40.800
<v Speaker 1>She's also motivated by a kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>essential ism.</v>

102
00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:43.230
<v Speaker 1>Let's call this the battle of essential </v>
<v Speaker 1>isms.</v>

103
00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:45.630
<v Speaker 1>Arie says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>humans are inherently evil.</v>

104
00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:46.493
<v Speaker 1>Diana says they're inherently good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While aries never abandoned his </v>

105
00:05:49.891 --> 00:05:51.660
<v Speaker 1>essential ism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Diana does,</v>

106
00:05:51.661 --> 00:05:54.810
<v Speaker 1>when she discovers humans can be dick </v>
<v Speaker 1>bags all on their own.</v>

107
00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:57.830
<v Speaker 1>We don't see too much more of this </v>
<v Speaker 1>crisis,</v>

108
00:05:57.831 --> 00:05:59.930
<v Speaker 1>but all is resolved by the time she </v>
<v Speaker 1>says.</v>

109
00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:04.640
<v Speaker 1>At first it might sound like she </v>
<v Speaker 1>believes in the love of Steve Trevor,</v>

110
00:06:04.641 --> 00:06:05.474
<v Speaker 1>but that doesn't make a ton of sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so let's give her a little more credit </v>

111
00:06:08.031 --> 00:06:08.540
<v Speaker 1>than that.</v>

112
00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:12.980
<v Speaker 1>It's only at the end that it becomes </v>
<v Speaker 1>clear to her and to us why saving people</v>

113
00:06:12.981 --> 00:06:13.814
<v Speaker 1>is the right thing to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What differentiates Diana at the end </v>

114
00:06:16.641 --> 00:06:17.474
<v Speaker 1>from someone like Captain America is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that she realizes it's not her duty to </v>

115
00:06:20.781 --> 00:06:21.614
<v Speaker 1>help people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She just wants to because she loves the </v>

116
00:06:23.661 --> 00:06:24.494
<v Speaker 1>shit out of humanity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even though that might sound like a </v>

117
00:06:28.041 --> 00:06:28.874
<v Speaker 1>Saccharin care bear cop out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not while she leaves behind the </v>

118
00:06:32.151 --> 00:06:32.984
<v Speaker 1>ideas of duty and deserving wonder woman</v>
<v Speaker 1>taps into a totally different ethical </v>

119
00:06:36.711 --> 00:06:37.544
<v Speaker 1>approach.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's pretty unique in the superhero </v>

120
00:06:39.171 --> 00:06:40.130
<v Speaker 1>genre.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hair.</v>

121
00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:40.973
<v Speaker 1>Epic's care ethics focuses on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship between the person who is </v>

122
00:06:44.121 --> 00:06:46.580
<v Speaker 1>caring for someone and the person who </v>
<v Speaker 1>was terrible.</v>

123
00:06:46.581 --> 00:06:49.490
<v Speaker 1>For a good example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a parent who loves their child,</v>

124
00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:52.190
<v Speaker 1>even if that child is terrible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or Logan.</v>

125
00:06:52.191 --> 00:06:53.024
<v Speaker 1>Paul,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unlike most traditional approaches to </v>

126
00:06:54.651 --> 00:06:55.484
<v Speaker 1>ethics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kara ethics rejects universalized </v>

127
00:06:57.141 --> 00:06:59.660
<v Speaker 1>principles for how to make judgments or </v>
<v Speaker 1>how to act.</v>

128
00:06:59.870 --> 00:07:02.720
<v Speaker 1>Everything is contextualized within the </v>
<v Speaker 1>given relationship.</v>

129
00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:05.030
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>certain practices are pretty important,</v>

130
00:07:05.031 --> 00:07:06.380
<v Speaker 1>like respect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>empathy,</v>

131
00:07:06.381 --> 00:07:07.214
<v Speaker 1>and attention to the needs of others.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes these relationships are on </v>

132
00:07:09.471 --> 00:07:11.120
<v Speaker 1>equal footing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not always.</v>

133
00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:12.163
<v Speaker 1>Wonder woman is not are equal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's more like a person caring for a </v>

134
00:07:14.961 --> 00:07:15.794
<v Speaker 1>perfect puppy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just like you're not born with an </v>

135
00:07:17.601 --> 00:07:18.434
<v Speaker 1>obligation to care for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A dog wonder woman knowingly chooses to </v>

136
00:07:21.441 --> 00:07:22.274
<v Speaker 1>enter a relationship of care with people</v>
<v Speaker 1>who will never be able to entirely </v>

137
00:07:25.551 --> 00:07:26.384
<v Speaker 1>reciprocate and maybe don't deserve it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She isn't pursuing a defined goal other </v>

138
00:07:30.771 --> 00:07:31.604
<v Speaker 1>than making the world a better place or </v>
<v Speaker 1>holding firm to certain universal </v>

139
00:07:34.251 --> 00:07:35.084
<v Speaker 1>principles like that man's idea that </v>
<v Speaker 1>killing is always wrong or captain </v>

140
00:07:38.091 --> 00:07:38.924
<v Speaker 1>America's belief in the American way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As long as you forget that whole hail </v>

141
00:07:41.421 --> 00:07:44.450
<v Speaker 1>hydra thick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she is responding as needed to the needs</v>

142
00:07:44.451 --> 00:07:46.130
<v Speaker 1>of those.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She cares for him.</v>

143
00:07:46.430 --> 00:07:47.263
<v Speaker 1>At the end of the film,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Diana's relationship rejects a kind of </v>

144
00:07:49.521 --> 00:07:54.290
<v Speaker 1>distributed or retributive justice and </v>
<v Speaker 1>instead she makes a choice to love them,</v>

145
00:07:54.780 --> 00:07:55.613
<v Speaker 2>but then I glimpsed the darkness that </v>
<v Speaker 2>lives within their lines and learn that </v>

146
00:08:00.181 --> 00:08:01.014
<v Speaker 2>inside every one of them there will </v>
<v Speaker 2>always be both and now I know only love </v>

147
00:08:09.750 --> 00:08:11.490
<v Speaker 2>can truly save the world.</v>

148
00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.880
<v Speaker 1>Diana's belief in love isn't a </v>
<v Speaker 1>meaningless platitudes.</v>

149
00:08:15.150 --> 00:08:15.983
<v Speaker 1>It's a declaration of her commitment to </v>
<v Speaker 1>a particular state of mind and action </v>

150
00:08:18.990 --> 00:08:19.823
<v Speaker 1>that guides her decisions as a hero.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is clear in her decision not to </v>

151
00:08:23.281 --> 00:08:27.540
<v Speaker 1>kill Dr poison despite her being a war </v>
<v Speaker 1>criminal and also really creepy</v>

152
00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:31.840
<v Speaker 2>is the perfect example.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pull off these humans.</v>

153
00:08:32.270 --> 00:08:35.140
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to want to be up y'all so </v>
<v Speaker 2>proper hear that</v>

154
00:08:35.950 --> 00:08:36.783
<v Speaker 1>although we would be a bit of a stretch </v>
<v Speaker 1>to say that wonder woman enters a </v>

155
00:08:38.861 --> 00:08:42.400
<v Speaker 1>relationship of care with colonel </v>
<v Speaker 1>mustard gas just because she decides not</v>

156
00:08:42.401 --> 00:08:43.234
<v Speaker 1>to throw a literal tank at her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's indicative of Diana's change in </v>

157
00:08:45.701 --> 00:08:46.534
<v Speaker 1>mindset.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is visually paralleled by doctor </v>

158
00:08:48.491 --> 00:08:49.324
<v Speaker 1>poisons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mass flying off piece by piece as the </v>

159
00:08:51.371 --> 00:08:54.100
<v Speaker 1>wind uncovers her true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>scarred ugly self.</v>

160
00:08:54.250 --> 00:08:55.083
<v Speaker 1>There's a very obvious metaphor and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Diana recognizes the complex nature and </v>

161
00:08:58.651 --> 00:09:00.540
<v Speaker 1>individual differences of humans.</v>

162
00:09:00.830 --> 00:09:04.250
<v Speaker 2>Everything you say so much</v>

163
00:09:04.330 --> 00:09:06.280
<v Speaker 1>more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though by most calculations,</v>

164
00:09:06.281 --> 00:09:07.114
<v Speaker 1>Dr poison probably deserves to die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Diana rejects the concept of deserving </v>

165
00:09:11.140 --> 00:09:11.973
<v Speaker 1>and by extension rejects the desert </v>
<v Speaker 1>theory of justice that aries is so fond </v>

166
00:09:15.281 --> 00:09:16.114
<v Speaker 1>of every superhero has his or her or its</v>
<v Speaker 1>reasons for blowing stuff up and saving </v>

167
00:09:20.591 --> 00:09:21.424
<v Speaker 1>the day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wonder woman defines Diana's ethos of </v>

168
00:09:23.171 --> 00:09:24.004
<v Speaker 1>care and solidifies her role in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Justice League for many franchises to </v>

169
00:09:26.921 --> 00:09:27.754
<v Speaker 1>come,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it also draws out a frequent theme </v>

170
00:09:29.591 --> 00:09:32.980
<v Speaker 1>in comics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The worthiness of the People Save Gotham</v>

171
00:09:32.981 --> 00:09:36.370
<v Speaker 1>doesn't deserve Batman and America </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't deserve Steve Rogers.</v>

172
00:09:36.430 --> 00:09:39.310
<v Speaker 1>Wonder woman raises a question that we </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't usually hear.</v>

173
00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:41.710
<v Speaker 1>Does humanity deserve to be saved at </v>
<v Speaker 1>all?</v>

174
00:09:41.860 --> 00:09:44.110
<v Speaker 1>And even if they don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>should we save them?</v>

175
00:09:44.230 --> 00:09:46.240
