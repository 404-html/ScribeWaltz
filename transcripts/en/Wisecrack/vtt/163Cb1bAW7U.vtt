1
00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:03.863
<v Speaker 1>Hey wise crack jared again and today </v>
<v Speaker 1>we're talking about everyone's favorite </v>

2
00:00:06.871 --> 00:00:08.220
<v Speaker 1>drug.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Addled Gandalf,</v>

3
00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:11.100
<v Speaker 1>Alan Moore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alan Moore has authored many of the most</v>

4
00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:11.993
<v Speaker 1>acclaimed comics of all time including </v>
<v Speaker 1>watchman miracle man and the killing </v>

5
00:00:16.081 --> 00:00:16.914
<v Speaker 1>joke and like the joker and Batman and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that story more straddles the thin line </v>

6
00:00:21.571 --> 00:00:23.730
<v Speaker 1>between genius and insanity.</v>

7
00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:24.743
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>decided it might be more interesting to </v>

8
00:00:26.091 --> 00:00:26.924
<v Speaker 2>actually terrified them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Boy going completely mad and declared </v>

9
00:00:30.761 --> 00:00:32.180
<v Speaker 2>myself to be a magician.</v>

10
00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:33.213
<v Speaker 1>He calls himself a ritual magician,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not the kind that pulls Ravitz from </v>

11
00:00:36.881 --> 00:00:37.714
<v Speaker 1>hats,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but these Stephen strange variety that </v>

12
00:00:39.521 --> 00:00:44.260
<v Speaker 1>consults grimoires and conjures demons </v>
<v Speaker 1>seriously at first glance.</v>

13
00:00:44.261 --> 00:00:45.094
<v Speaker 1>Much of what more means by magic seems </v>
<v Speaker 1>more like the superstitions of a man </v>

14
00:00:48.641 --> 00:00:51.520
<v Speaker 1>hitting his corn cob wizard pipe a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little too hard,</v>

15
00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:52.473
<v Speaker 1>but if we take more seriously for a bit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a pretty fascinating philosophy </v>

16
00:00:56.291 --> 00:00:57.124
<v Speaker 1>at play here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what can we learn from a guy who </v>

17
00:00:58.631 --> 00:01:01.180
<v Speaker 1>claims he tried to end the world?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

18
00:01:01.181 --> 00:01:02.014
<v Speaker 1>we're going to have to dive into a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little known and even less understood a </v>

19
00:01:05.051 --> 00:01:08.300
<v Speaker 1>cult tradition known as hermeticism </v>
<v Speaker 1>welcome us.</v>

20
00:01:08.301 --> 00:01:10.870
<v Speaker 1>Wise crack addition on the philosophy of</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alan Moore.</v>

21
00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:14.980
<v Speaker 1>Today's topic is magic real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a ton more to cover however,</v>

22
00:01:14.981 --> 00:01:16.720
<v Speaker 1>so if you want more,</v>

23
00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:20.443
<v Speaker 1>let us know in the comments.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But first a quick shout out to our </v>

24
00:01:22.641 --> 00:01:23.474
<v Speaker 1>sponsor hymns who allows men to turn to </v>
<v Speaker 1>science rather than magic when it comes </v>

25
00:01:27.051 --> 00:01:27.884
<v Speaker 1>to hair loss.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hims is a personalized and private </v>

<v Speaker 1>medical grade products and connect with </v>

<v Speaker 1>real doctors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They offer solutions to treatable </v>

28

<v Speaker 1>so you can hopefully look like Alan </v>

<v Speaker 1>Ed and since 18 to 40 year old men are </v>

32
00:01:50.511 --> 00:01:53.750
<v Speaker 1>less likely than any other group to </v>
<v Speaker 1>visit the doctor or pharmacy,</v>

33
00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:54.643
<v Speaker 1>which is where you get your medicine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm told Hams lets you chat with real </v>

<v Speaker 1>leave the house again.</v>

<v Speaker 1>More is a student of Hermeticism,</v>

42
00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:30.350
<v Speaker 1>which is less a religion with set </v>
<v Speaker 1>doctrines and more a set of interrelated</v>

43
00:02:30.351 --> 00:02:34.250
<v Speaker 1>practices and principles hermeticism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His goal is to seek understanding of the</v>

44
00:02:34.251 --> 00:02:36.380
<v Speaker 1>world through three methods,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alchemy,</v>

45
00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:40.040
<v Speaker 1>astrology and fear g.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first two are familiar enough,</v>

46
00:02:40.041 --> 00:02:40.874
<v Speaker 1>but the third theory is basically the </v>
<v Speaker 1>process of achieving spiritual </v>

47
00:02:44.661 --> 00:02:47.900
<v Speaker 1>perfection with the goal of growing ever</v>
<v Speaker 1>nearer to God.</v>

48
00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:49.003
<v Speaker 1>Hermeticism is largely based on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>teachings of the Corpus Hermetic up by </v>

49
00:02:51.861 --> 00:02:52.694
<v Speaker 1>the mythical Hermes Trismus justice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a mixture of Hermes and thought </v>

50
00:02:56.361 --> 00:02:57.194
<v Speaker 1>both the Greek and Egyptian gods of </v>
<v Speaker 1>language and wisdom respectively to </v>

51
00:03:00.641 --> 00:03:01.474
<v Speaker 1>more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This mixture of language and </v>

52
00:03:02.621 --> 00:03:07.621
<v Speaker 1>understanding is the heart of magic in </v>
<v Speaker 1>his upcoming the moon and serpent bumper</v>

53
00:03:07.781 --> 00:03:12.430
<v Speaker 1>book of magic more defines magic as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>purposeful engagement with the phenomena</v>

54
00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:14.440
<v Speaker 1>and possibilities of consciousness.</v>

55
00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:15.453
<v Speaker 1>So what does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Essentially Morris saying that what we </v>

56
00:03:18.431 --> 00:03:21.580
<v Speaker 1>call reality can be broken up into two </v>
<v Speaker 1>categories.</v>

57
00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:22.503
<v Speaker 1>Who material and the immaterial.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The material is all the physical stuff </v>

58
00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.480
<v Speaker 1>matter and energy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>space and time,</v>

59
00:03:28.481 --> 00:03:30.250
<v Speaker 1>fundamental forces,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all that,</v>

60
00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:33.190
<v Speaker 1>but we never experienced those things </v>
<v Speaker 1>directly.</v>

61
00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:35.200
<v Speaker 1>Photons hit our retina,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pressure,</v>

62
00:03:35.201 --> 00:03:36.700
<v Speaker 1>waves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>impact or eardrums.</v>

63
00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:37.593
<v Speaker 1>Those signals get sent to our brains and</v>
<v Speaker 1>based on that limited sensory </v>

64
00:03:40.331 --> 00:03:41.164
<v Speaker 1>information,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the brain makes a mental model of what </v>

65
00:03:43.151 --> 00:03:45.400
<v Speaker 1>it perceives the external world to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>like.</v>

66
00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:46.413
<v Speaker 1>That mental model is the immaterial to </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand how the material and </v>

67
00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:53.050
<v Speaker 1>immaterial affect each other in profound</v>
<v Speaker 1>ways.</v>

68
00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:57.670
<v Speaker 1>Let's think of watchman more had an </v>
<v Speaker 1>ephemeral idea in his head for a story,</v>

69
00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:02.350
<v Speaker 1>but it wasn't until artist Dave gibbons </v>
<v Speaker 1>gave the idea form by penciling in those</v>

70
00:04:02.351 --> 00:04:03.184
<v Speaker 1>panels that it achieved a four.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Moore's intangible thought had a </v>

71
00:04:06.161 --> 00:04:10.270
<v Speaker 1>tangible effect on the arrangement of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the atoms that became watchman.</v>

72
00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:13.900
<v Speaker 1>The opposite is true as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're picturing in your mind's eye,</v>

73
00:04:13.901 --> 00:04:14.734
<v Speaker 1>doctor Manhattan statuesque and </v>
<v Speaker 1>uncensored Azor Fallis for no other </v>

74
00:04:18.461 --> 00:04:19.294
<v Speaker 1>reason than because I mentioning it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the physical sound of my voice has </v>

75
00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:26.050
<v Speaker 1>altered your perception by conjuring </v>
<v Speaker 1>that image in your mind.</v>

76
00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:26.973
<v Speaker 1>I cast a genuine spell to more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's all magic is magic bridges the </v>

77
00:04:31.631 --> 00:04:36.010
<v Speaker 1>divide between the material and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>immaterial art language symbols.</v>

78
00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:37.023
<v Speaker 1>These are the real wizards wants per </v>
<v Speaker 1>more magic is intrinsically connected </v>

79
00:04:40.931 --> 00:04:41.764
<v Speaker 1>with art,</v>
<v Speaker 1>language and consciousness to the point </v>

80
00:04:43.601 --> 00:04:44.434
<v Speaker 1>where these four things almost become </v>
<v Speaker 1>different aspects of the same </v>

81
00:04:47.021 --> 00:04:47.854
<v Speaker 1>phenomenon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This same principle as seen in the </v>

82
00:04:49.961 --> 00:04:50.794
<v Speaker 1>rabbit duck illusion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At first glance you see either a rapid </v>

83
00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:54.543
<v Speaker 1>or a duck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just because someone's mind initially </v>

84
00:04:56.231 --> 00:04:59.920
<v Speaker 1>interpreted as duck doesn't mean that </v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning is fixed.</v>

85
00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:00.933
<v Speaker 1>All it takes is for someone to tell them</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's also a rabbit and all of a sudden </v>

86
00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:06.340
<v Speaker 1>it changes right before their eyes.</v>

87
00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:11.290
<v Speaker 1>It's storytelling as spell craft.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just as storytelling can be used to cast</v>

88
00:05:11.291 --> 00:05:12.124
<v Speaker 1>illusions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It can likewise dispel them as an </v>

89
00:05:14.471 --> 00:05:15.304
<v Speaker 1>anarchist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>More counts money among the more </v>

90
00:05:17.021 --> 00:05:20.770
<v Speaker 1>destructive illusions to ever distort </v>
<v Speaker 1>mankind's collective conscious.</v>

91
00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:21.783
<v Speaker 1>When miracle man tasks himself with </v>
<v Speaker 1>making earth a utopia among the first </v>

92
00:05:25.061 --> 00:05:25.894
<v Speaker 1>things he does is abolish money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Suddenly announcing money is a promise </v>

93
00:05:29.561 --> 00:05:30.394
<v Speaker 1>to redeem the cache of every bearer for </v>
<v Speaker 1>its worth in gold or merchandise and </v>

94
00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:34.773
<v Speaker 1>empty promise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Should we all demand at once redemption </v>

95
00:05:37.181 --> 00:05:40.420
<v Speaker 1>of our coins,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we learned such wealth does not exist.</v>

96
00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:43.570
<v Speaker 1>Monies imaginary real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we believe in it,</v>

97
00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:47.770
<v Speaker 1>come summer money won't exist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then it never did.</v>

98
00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:48.963
<v Speaker 1>This method of magically altering </v>
<v Speaker 1>something by changing the way you think </v>

99
00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:52.803
<v Speaker 1>is most clearly seen in promethium.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A notable example happens when </v>

100
00:05:56.321 --> 00:06:01.321
<v Speaker 1>protagonists has a rematch with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>demon king as modus initially and co are</v>

101
00:06:01.941 --> 00:06:02.774
<v Speaker 1>set on slaying asthma day in anger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's only when they accept that so </v>

102
00:06:06.501 --> 00:06:08.960
<v Speaker 1>called demons are just a part of human </v>
<v Speaker 1>nature.</v>

103
00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:13.400
<v Speaker 1>The worst parts that as modus is </v>
<v Speaker 1>appearance shifts to that of a human.</v>

104
00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:15.530
<v Speaker 1>He explains,</v>
<v Speaker 1>approached us with fear,</v>

105
00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:18.800
<v Speaker 1>with hatred and revulsion and we will be</v>
<v Speaker 1>fearsome,</v>

106
00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:19.663
<v Speaker 1>hateful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and while approaches humanely and with </v>

107
00:06:21.771 --> 00:06:25.880
<v Speaker 1>respect and we will be human and </v>
<v Speaker 1>respectable for the magician,</v>

108
00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:26.773
<v Speaker 1>expectation creates perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even doctor Manhattan is a magician in </v>

109
00:06:30.711 --> 00:06:34.110
<v Speaker 1>this sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He externally appears as an ageless aqua</v>

110
00:06:34.111 --> 00:06:34.944
<v Speaker 1>marine adonis with alopecia solely </v>
<v Speaker 1>because this is how he internally </v>

111
00:06:38.421 --> 00:06:39.254
<v Speaker 1>perceives himself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if a sufficiently compelling story </v>

112
00:06:41.901 --> 00:06:45.620
<v Speaker 1>can magically change our perception of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>single phenomenon,</v>

113
00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:46.573
<v Speaker 1>what happens if we tell a story that </v>
<v Speaker 1>tries to account for all the phenomenon </v>

114
00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:50.933
<v Speaker 1>in existence more does exactly that in </v>
<v Speaker 1>promethium telling a story about </v>

115
00:06:54.801 --> 00:06:58.460
<v Speaker 1>everything as a spell to change our </v>
<v Speaker 1>perceptions about everything.</v>

116
00:06:58.730 --> 00:07:01.250
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can never quite wrap our heads around</v>

117
00:07:01.251 --> 00:07:04.370
<v Speaker 1>the infinite expanse of all space time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we don't need to.</v>

118
00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:05.413
<v Speaker 1>One of her medicines,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his most famous principles is something </v>

119
00:07:07.461 --> 00:07:11.900
<v Speaker 1>called macrocosm and microcosm expressed</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the Maxim as above.</v>

120
00:07:11.901 --> 00:07:12.734
<v Speaker 1>So below this principle presumes that </v>
<v Speaker 1>every level of reality reflects every </v>

121
00:07:16.401 --> 00:07:21.200
<v Speaker 1>other like an infinite fractal or like </v>
<v Speaker 1>how everything wrong with youtube can be</v>

122
00:07:21.201 --> 00:07:22.034
<v Speaker 1>distilled down to Logan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Paul and all the worst things about </v>

123
00:07:24.291 --> 00:07:26.990
<v Speaker 1>Logan Paul or echo throughout youtubes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>other channels.</v>

124
00:07:27.230 --> 00:07:28.063
<v Speaker 1>Being able to understand one part of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>pattern allows you to better understand </v>

125
00:07:31.551 --> 00:07:35.480
<v Speaker 1>the whole and in turn move from lower </v>
<v Speaker 1>levels to higher levels.</v>

126
00:07:35.750 --> 00:07:36.583
<v Speaker 1>With promethium.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The entire structure of the series is </v>

127
00:07:38.571 --> 00:07:42.630
<v Speaker 1>deliberately based upon a specific </v>
<v Speaker 1>structure that repeats at macro,</v>

128
00:07:42.631 --> 00:07:47.630
<v Speaker 1>cosmic and micro cosmic levels from </v>
<v Speaker 1>entire neve existence to each individual</v>

129
00:07:47.631 --> 00:07:49.970
<v Speaker 1>soul,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Kabbalah tree of life.</v>

130
00:07:50.390 --> 00:07:53.690
<v Speaker 1>For more the tree of life is the roadmap</v>
<v Speaker 1>to all reality,</v>

131
00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:57.980
<v Speaker 1>including our inner lives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At the bottom rung is mere perception.</v>

132
00:07:58.130 --> 00:08:01.400
<v Speaker 1>Seeing the rabbit or duck above that is </v>
<v Speaker 1>imagination.</v>

133
00:08:01.580 --> 00:08:05.300
<v Speaker 1>The ability to make mental models of </v>
<v Speaker 1>things not directly apprehended with our</v>

134
00:08:05.301 --> 00:08:06.134
<v Speaker 1>senses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Above that is our capacity for art and </v>

135
00:08:08.181 --> 00:08:09.014
<v Speaker 1>language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You build lead to tie ideas to sound </v>

136
00:08:11.481 --> 00:08:12.314
<v Speaker 1>symbols,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pictures and stories and above that our </v>

137
00:08:14.301 --> 00:08:17.180
<v Speaker 1>capacity for emotion and reason </v>
<v Speaker 1>respectively.</v>

138
00:08:17.450 --> 00:08:18.283
<v Speaker 1>At the macroscopic level,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the physical universe is the basis </v>

139
00:08:21.261 --> 00:08:22.580
<v Speaker 1>sphere of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Soul.</v>

140
00:08:22.790 --> 00:08:23.623
<v Speaker 1>Above that is everyone's collective </v>
<v Speaker 1>unconscious and at the very top of the </v>

141
00:08:26.421 --> 00:08:30.680
<v Speaker 1>tree is what early her medicines called </v>
<v Speaker 1>the all the one God.</v>

142
00:08:31.100 --> 00:08:31.933
<v Speaker 1>That's why premia is 32 issues long </v>
<v Speaker 1>corresponding to the 10 spheres and 22 </v>

143
00:08:36.291 --> 00:08:38.540
<v Speaker 1>paths of the tree of life added </v>
<v Speaker 1>together.</v>

144
00:08:38.630 --> 00:08:43.630
<v Speaker 1>The story itself ends at issue 31 so he </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrote a 32nd issue itself,</v>

145
00:08:44.361 --> 00:08:48.290
<v Speaker 1>32 pages with each page expounding upon </v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the paths.</v>

146
00:08:48.530 --> 00:08:49.363
<v Speaker 1>Thus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the issue was a deliberate microcosm of </v>

147
00:08:51.261 --> 00:08:56.261
<v Speaker 1>the series as a whole and the series a </v>
<v Speaker 1>macrocosm of the issue or as above.</v>

148
00:08:56.790 --> 00:08:57.623
<v Speaker 1>So below another hermetic principal used</v>
<v Speaker 1>by more is solve at Coagula or separate </v>

149
00:09:02.881 --> 00:09:03.714
<v Speaker 1>and combined basically breaking a thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>down into its component parts to better </v>

150
00:09:07.061 --> 00:09:07.894
<v Speaker 1>understand how the whole fits together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dr Manhattan's are in watchman is all </v>

151
00:09:11.771 --> 00:09:15.190
<v Speaker 1>about him learning solve at Coagula.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When we first meet him,</v>

152
00:09:15.191 --> 00:09:16.024
<v Speaker 1>he expresses an understanding of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>first half separate better than anyone </v>

153
00:09:19.121 --> 00:09:21.730
<v Speaker 1>else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's detached from humanity because he's</v>

154
00:09:21.731 --> 00:09:24.880
<v Speaker 1>mentally broken humans down into their </v>
<v Speaker 1>base components,</v>

155
00:09:24.940 --> 00:09:29.500
<v Speaker 1>not unlike his father did with watches.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His breakthrough on Mars is learning not</v>

156
00:09:29.501 --> 00:09:33.190
<v Speaker 1>merely to break humans down into </v>
<v Speaker 1>abstract arrangements of atoms.</v>

157
00:09:33.340 --> 00:09:34.173
<v Speaker 3>In my opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the existence of life is highly over </v>

158
00:09:39.391 --> 00:09:40.290
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this phenomenon,</v>

159
00:09:40.730 --> 00:09:40.880
<v Speaker 3>but</v>

160
00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:44.690
<v Speaker 1>rather to conceptually recombine and </v>
<v Speaker 1>perceive them as holistic.</v>

161
00:09:44.691 --> 00:09:49.190
<v Speaker 1>Four dimensional objects solve at </v>
<v Speaker 1>Coagula is seen even more clearly in the</v>

162
00:09:49.191 --> 00:09:50.024
<v Speaker 1>sixth issue of promethium.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sophie finds herself inside humanity's </v>

163
00:09:53.151 --> 00:09:57.650
<v Speaker 1>collective imagination and faces off </v>
<v Speaker 1>with writer Marto Nip Tura the pseudonym</v>

164
00:09:57.651 --> 00:10:00.590
<v Speaker 1>for a writer of the promethium character</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a writer,</v>

165
00:10:00.610 --> 00:10:04.100
<v Speaker 1>nip turns power over the land of fiction</v>
<v Speaker 1>is nearly absolute.</v>

166
00:10:04.310 --> 00:10:05.143
<v Speaker 1>Sophie is only able to defeat him by </v>
<v Speaker 1>understanding that nip Turo was the </v>

167
00:10:08.391 --> 00:10:11.060
<v Speaker 1>collective pen name of various </v>
<v Speaker 1>novelists.</v>

168
00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:11.953
<v Speaker 1>Cut Down to is separate unique styles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if a compelling story can change </v>

169
00:10:15.561 --> 00:10:19.370
<v Speaker 1>one's view of the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what happens when a story is so complete</v>

170
00:10:19.371 --> 00:10:20.204
<v Speaker 1>a model of the world that it changes the</v>
<v Speaker 1>perception of our entire species for </v>

171
00:10:24.351 --> 00:10:26.870
<v Speaker 1>more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When everyone's way of viewing the world</v>

172
00:10:26.871 --> 00:10:30.040
<v Speaker 1>one way ends,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world ends in promethium.</v>

173
00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:33.470
<v Speaker 1>This is exactly the task that's sophie </v>
<v Speaker 1>has given Margaret,</v>

174
00:10:33.471 --> 00:10:35.870
<v Speaker 1>one of the prometheans before Sophie </v>
<v Speaker 1>explains,</v>

175
00:10:35.930 --> 00:10:37.310
<v Speaker 1>humans are amphibious.</v>

176
00:10:37.370 --> 00:10:39.440
<v Speaker 1>That means they live in two worlds at </v>
<v Speaker 1>once.</v>

177
00:10:39.590 --> 00:10:43.550
<v Speaker 1>Matter and mind promethium makes people </v>
<v Speaker 1>more aware of the fast,</v>

178
00:10:43.580 --> 00:10:46.490
<v Speaker 1>immaterial realm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe tempts them to explore it.</v>

179
00:10:46.670 --> 00:10:49.310
<v Speaker 1>Imagine if too many people followed </v>
<v Speaker 1>where she led.</v>

180
00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:50.233
<v Speaker 1>It would be like the great Devonian leap</v>
<v Speaker 1>from C to land to entity slithering up </v>

181
00:10:54.201 --> 00:10:57.980
<v Speaker 1>the beach from one element into another </v>
<v Speaker 1>from matter to mind.</v>

182
00:10:58.340 --> 00:11:01.730
<v Speaker 1>More believes that it was through a </v>
<v Speaker 1>similar leap from matter to mind.</v>

183
00:11:01.731 --> 00:11:04.400
<v Speaker 1>Vet Our ideas about the world began in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the first place.</v>

184
00:11:04.610 --> 00:11:08.420
<v Speaker 1>Representation allows for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>origination of verbal language with this</v>

185
00:11:08.421 --> 00:11:09.254
<v Speaker 1>sound or this collection of mark.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Somehow also standing for that buffalo </v>

186
00:11:12.321 --> 00:11:13.154
<v Speaker 1>over their language is the necessary </v>
<v Speaker 1>precursor of are apparently unique form </v>

187
00:11:16.761 --> 00:11:17.594
<v Speaker 1>of consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Humanity's first purposeful engagement </v>

188
00:11:19.641 --> 00:11:22.070
<v Speaker 1>with the phenomenon and possibilities of</v>
<v Speaker 1>consciousness.</v>

189
00:11:22.340 --> 00:11:27.320
<v Speaker 1>Out of this engagement sprang almost </v>
<v Speaker 1>full blown the entirety of human culture</v>

190
00:11:27.470 --> 00:11:28.790
<v Speaker 1>writing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>painting,</v>

191
00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:30.860
<v Speaker 1>Song,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Usic Theater,</v>

192
00:11:30.920 --> 00:11:32.360
<v Speaker 1>science,</v>
<v Speaker 1>medicine,</v>

193
00:11:32.361 --> 00:11:33.710
<v Speaker 1>and even politics.</v>

194
00:11:33.860 --> 00:11:37.700
<v Speaker 1>And so in the same way that this idea of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world began,</v>

195
00:11:37.850 --> 00:11:40.940
<v Speaker 1>it also ends in the series penultimate </v>
<v Speaker 1>issues.</v>

196
00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:45.050
<v Speaker 1>Sophie succeeds in bringing about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>apocalypse by explaining to everyone the</v>

197
00:11:45.051 --> 00:11:47.450
<v Speaker 1>same hermetic principles we've been </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about.</v>

198
00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:52.160
<v Speaker 1>Everyone now perceives the immaterial </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the material worlds as equally real.</v>

199
00:11:52.340 --> 00:11:53.173
<v Speaker 1>But while permia bringing about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world's end within the comics more was </v>

200
00:11:56.291 --> 00:12:01.291
<v Speaker 1>contemplating how our world will end in </v>
<v Speaker 1>a similar fashion in the 12th issue more</v>

201
00:12:01.601 --> 00:12:02.434
<v Speaker 1>uses the Taro to trace the history of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the world from the initial quantum </v>

202
00:12:05.561 --> 00:12:06.394
<v Speaker 1>vacuum and God big bang,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the universe into existence all the way </v>

203
00:12:09.371 --> 00:12:10.204
<v Speaker 1>to the coming leap to expanded </v>
<v Speaker 1>consciousness more places his own doom </v>

204
00:12:13.551 --> 00:12:17.650
<v Speaker 1>say cock quite close to midnight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like his character roar shack carrying a</v>

205
00:12:17.651 --> 00:12:18.484
<v Speaker 1>sign that says the end is nigh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How near riding that issue in 1999 more </v>

206
00:12:22.841 --> 00:12:27.460
<v Speaker 1>predicted the end of the world as we </v>
<v Speaker 1>know it would occur in 2017 when the sum</v>

207
00:12:27.461 --> 00:12:28.294
<v Speaker 1>total of our knowledge would double at a</v>
<v Speaker 1>rate of every half second with so much </v>

208
00:12:31.841 --> 00:12:32.674
<v Speaker 1>new knowledge coming so quickly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our old ways of understanding the world </v>

209
00:12:35.710 --> 00:12:39.940
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't be able to keep up and we </v>
<v Speaker 1>naturally need new ways of understanding</v>

210
00:12:39.941 --> 00:12:40.774
<v Speaker 1>the new world.</v>

211
00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:41.793
<v Speaker 1>Those of you alive back in 2017 may </v>
<v Speaker 1>recall that the world did not in fact </v>

212
00:12:45.851 --> 00:12:46.684
<v Speaker 1>come to an end,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but before the year came and went more </v>

213
00:12:49.151 --> 00:12:53.350
<v Speaker 1>himself tried like his character </v>
<v Speaker 1>promethium to herald the apocalypse.</v>

214
00:12:53.351 --> 00:12:54.184
<v Speaker 1>At the hour heat appointed in September </v>
<v Speaker 1>of 2016 on the eve of his prophesized </v>

215
00:12:58.241 --> 00:13:01.540
<v Speaker 1>worlds in more released his magnum opus </v>
<v Speaker 1>Jerusalem.</v>

216
00:13:01.720 --> 00:13:02.553
<v Speaker 1>If promethium was a spell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he has to magically change the minds of </v>

217
00:13:05.410 --> 00:13:08.800
<v Speaker 1>individual readers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jerusalem was the ritual he performed to</v>

218
00:13:08.801 --> 00:13:09.634
<v Speaker 1>bring about worldwide revelation as more</v>
<v Speaker 1>himself a test rather than performing a </v>

219
00:13:13.961 --> 00:13:14.794
<v Speaker 1>ritual to produce a successful book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The book itself is the 10 year ritual </v>

220
00:13:18.551 --> 00:13:20.770
<v Speaker 1>working that is intended to have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>certain,</v>

221
00:13:20.830 --> 00:13:24.430
<v Speaker 1>hopefully beneficial effect upon the </v>
<v Speaker 1>consciousness of its readership.</v>

222
00:13:24.730 --> 00:13:28.600
<v Speaker 1>Jerusalem seems to me to be my most </v>
<v Speaker 1>sophisticated and complex,</v>

223
00:13:28.601 --> 00:13:32.770
<v Speaker 1>magical working thus far and certainly </v>
<v Speaker 1>the most ambitious in its aims.</v>

224
00:13:32.890 --> 00:13:36.010
<v Speaker 1>Ambitious in its aims is an </v>
<v Speaker 1>understatement.</v>

225
00:13:36.130 --> 00:13:36.963
<v Speaker 1>More rights in such a way that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>reader experiences the higher states of </v>

226
00:13:40.361 --> 00:13:41.194
<v Speaker 1>consciousness that the narrative is at </v>
<v Speaker 1>the same moment describing not this </v>

227
00:13:44.351 --> 00:13:45.184
<v Speaker 1>similar to the way the heptopods </v>
<v Speaker 1>language in a rifle profoundly affects </v>

228
00:13:48.041 --> 00:13:48.874
<v Speaker 1>lois lane's perception of time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is especially evident in a chapter </v>

229
00:13:52.061 --> 00:13:52.894
<v Speaker 1>told from the perspective of Lucy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a joist during her confinement in an </v>

230
00:13:55.571 --> 00:13:56.404
<v Speaker 1>asylum in employees,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the same linguistic style found in her </v>

231
00:13:58.661 --> 00:14:01.390
<v Speaker 1>father's novel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Finnegan's wake abounding in puns,</v>

232
00:14:01.391 --> 00:14:02.224
<v Speaker 1>portmanteaus and the alogia slums in </v>
<v Speaker 1>order to replicate Lucy as condition </v>

233
00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:06.513
<v Speaker 1>more explorers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How those exhibiting certain forms of </v>

234
00:14:08.531 --> 00:14:09.364
<v Speaker 1>insanity might be closer to perceiving </v>
<v Speaker 1>external reality than those who are </v>

235
00:14:13.181 --> 00:14:14.014
<v Speaker 1>deemed quote sane in watchmen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Doctor Manhattan perceives every moment </v>

236
00:14:17.681 --> 00:14:18.514
<v Speaker 1>of his life simultaneously a far </v>
<v Speaker 1>different perception than quote sane </v>

237
00:14:22.331 --> 00:14:26.350
<v Speaker 1>individuals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But more like Einstein regards time as a</v>

238
00:14:26.380 --> 00:14:27.213
<v Speaker 1>stubbornly persistent illusion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the fact that Manhattan is not taken </v>

239
00:14:30.581 --> 00:14:33.520
<v Speaker 1>in by this delusion of time makes him </v>
<v Speaker 1>more sane,</v>

240
00:14:33.640 --> 00:14:34.600
<v Speaker 1>not less.</v>

241
00:14:34.690 --> 00:14:35.523
<v Speaker 1>It's we who are deficient for perceiving</v>
<v Speaker 1>only the now rather than being able to </v>

242
00:14:38.891 --> 00:14:40.780
<v Speaker 1>gaze upon the past,</v>
<v Speaker 1>present and future.</v>

243
00:14:40.781 --> 00:14:44.380
<v Speaker 1>Like we might take three dimensional </v>
<v Speaker 1>plane in order to get us in the habit of</v>

244
00:14:44.381 --> 00:14:45.214
<v Speaker 1>perceiving the dimensions which we might</v>
<v Speaker 1>not initially perceive more employees </v>

245
00:14:48.671 --> 00:14:49.504
<v Speaker 1>solve at Coagula to language itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Taking apart the written word into its </v>

246
00:14:53.031 --> 00:14:55.490
<v Speaker 1>base components,</v>
<v Speaker 1>separating phonetics,</v>

247
00:14:55.580 --> 00:14:58.340
<v Speaker 1>how vocalized words sound from Graph </v>
<v Speaker 1>Fenix,</v>

248
00:14:58.400 --> 00:14:59.233
<v Speaker 1>how written words appear more writes </v>
<v Speaker 1>dialogue as a series of words that look </v>

249
00:15:02.691 --> 00:15:06.050
<v Speaker 1>like Jibberish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when read phonetically makes sense,</v>

250
00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:07.093
<v Speaker 1>more forces the readers who read </v>
<v Speaker 1>multiple layers of meaning in every </v>

251
00:15:09.531 --> 00:15:10.730
<v Speaker 1>word.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

252
00:15:10.731 --> 00:15:13.370
<v Speaker 1>if you read this aloud,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get the phonetic dimension.</v>

253
00:15:13.490 --> 00:15:14.323
<v Speaker 1>Her father in his time maintains that we</v>
<v Speaker 1>are in a universe composed of four </v>

254
00:15:17.841 --> 00:15:18.674
<v Speaker 1>dimensions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>only three of which are naturally </v>

255
00:15:20.541 --> 00:15:23.990
<v Speaker 1>visible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This phonetic dimension is only one side</v>

256
00:15:23.991 --> 00:15:26.720
<v Speaker 1>of the techs and if it's the only part </v>
<v Speaker 1>we observe,</v>

257
00:15:26.780 --> 00:15:29.150
<v Speaker 1>we miss out on its other possible </v>
<v Speaker 1>meanings.</v>

258
00:15:29.450 --> 00:15:32.240
<v Speaker 1>The jibberish is full of double </v>
<v Speaker 1>Entendre,</v>

259
00:15:32.360 --> 00:15:33.193
<v Speaker 1>like spelling dimension in a way that </v>
<v Speaker 1>resembles dementia or universe in a way </v>

260
00:15:37.701 --> 00:15:38.534
<v Speaker 1>that resembles loony more teaches us to </v>
<v Speaker 1>read with more dimensions than we </v>

261
00:15:42.321 --> 00:15:46.910
<v Speaker 1>normally perceive in a text about how </v>
<v Speaker 1>the universe has more dimensions than we</v>

262
00:15:46.911 --> 00:15:50.750
<v Speaker 1>normally perceive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's explanation and example at the same</v>

263
00:15:50.751 --> 00:15:51.584
<v Speaker 1>time magically changing how our mind </v>
<v Speaker 1>models of the world by changing the </v>

264
00:15:54.831 --> 00:15:57.800
<v Speaker 1>language with which our minds construct </v>
<v Speaker 1>that model.</v>

265
00:15:58.070 --> 00:15:58.903
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if everyone in the whole world did </v>

266
00:16:00.891 --> 00:16:03.860
<v Speaker 1>read Jerusalem and have their minds </v>
<v Speaker 1>expanded by more,</v>

267
00:16:03.980 --> 00:16:04.813
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't necessarily follow that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'd make the great leap from the murky </v>

268
00:16:07.791 --> 00:16:11.420
<v Speaker 1>waters of matter to the solid land of </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideas and imagination.</v>

269
00:16:11.750 --> 00:16:12.583
<v Speaker 1>While more may not have managed to bring</v>
<v Speaker 1>about his revelation in 2017 given his </v>

270
00:16:16.101 --> 00:16:19.160
<v Speaker 1>status as the most influential writer in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the history of comics,</v>

271
00:16:19.310 --> 00:16:23.570
<v Speaker 1>his literary efforts are likely to </v>
<v Speaker 1>remain influential for centuries.</v>

272
00:16:23.840 --> 00:16:26.570
<v Speaker 1>So is magic real?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If more is right,</v>

273
00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:29.000
<v Speaker 1>it's at least as real as our </v>
<v Speaker 1>imagination.</v>

274
00:16:29.360 --> 00:16:32.270
<v Speaker 1>This is prometheans revelation that ends</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world.</v>

275
00:16:32.450 --> 00:16:34.820
<v Speaker 1>Speaking not to any of the characters in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the comic,</v>

276
00:16:34.940 --> 00:16:37.430
<v Speaker 1>but to you the reader.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm an idea,</v>

277
00:16:37.460 --> 00:16:41.510
<v Speaker 1>but I'm a real idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm the idea of human imagination,</v>

278
00:16:41.810 --> 00:16:42.643
<v Speaker 1>which when you think about it is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>only thing we can really be certain </v>

279
00:16:45.530 --> 00:16:47.330
<v Speaker 1>isn't imaginary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

280
00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:48.433
<v Speaker 1>I'm imagination.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm real and I'm the best friend you </v>

281
00:16:50.840 --> 00:16:52.550
<v Speaker 1>ever had.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who Do you think got you?</v>

282
00:16:52.551 --> 00:16:54.980
<v Speaker 1>All this cool stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The clothes you're wearing,</v>

283
00:16:55.130 --> 00:16:56.570
<v Speaker 1>the room,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the house,</v>

284
00:16:56.571 --> 00:16:58.670
<v Speaker 1>the city that you're in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything in.</v>

285
00:16:58.671 --> 00:17:01.910
<v Speaker 1>It started out in the human imagination,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your lives,</v>

286
00:17:01.911 --> 00:17:03.920
<v Speaker 1>your personalities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your whole world,</v>

287
00:17:04.070 --> 00:17:08.060
<v Speaker 1>all invented,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all made up and there's nothing here but</v>

288
00:17:08.061 --> 00:17:08.894
<v Speaker 1>a funny little twist of amino acids </v>
<v Speaker 1>playing a marvelous game of pretend to </v>

289
00:17:13.191 --> 00:17:16.100
<v Speaker 1>that list of cool stuff that imagination</v>
<v Speaker 1>has given us.</v>

290
00:17:16.190 --> 00:17:20.000
<v Speaker 1>We can certainly add the highly </v>
<v Speaker 1>imaginative works of Alan Moore.</v>

291
00:17:20.450 --> 00:17:21.283
