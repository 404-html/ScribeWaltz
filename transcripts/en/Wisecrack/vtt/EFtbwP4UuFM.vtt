<v Speaker 1>Jared,</v>

4
00:00:08.061 --> 00:00:09.420
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we saw your request.</v>

5
00:00:09.421 --> 00:00:10.254
<v Speaker 1>So today we're putting the crazy hat </v>
<v Speaker 1>back on to dive into the philosophy of </v>

6
00:00:13.401 --> 00:00:14.234
<v Speaker 1>grant Morrison.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Writer of such a claimed works as also </v>

7
00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:20.300
<v Speaker 1>our superman flex men,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tallow and multiversity like Alan Moore.</v>

8
00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:21.253
<v Speaker 1>Greg Morrison was part of the British </v>
<v Speaker 1>invasion that revolutionized comics in </v>

9
00:00:24.441 --> 00:00:25.274
<v Speaker 1>the 80s and also like more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a self proclaimed magician with an </v>

10
00:00:28.641 --> 00:00:30.560
<v Speaker 1>affinity for psychotropic drugs.</v>

11
00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:31.493
<v Speaker 3>To me it just comes in a very simple </v>
<v Speaker 3>equation is that wife plus significance </v>

12
00:00:36.361 --> 00:00:37.410
<v Speaker 3>equals magic.</v>

13
00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:41.530
<v Speaker 1>But there are major differences between </v>
<v Speaker 1>them beyond their obvious discrepancy in</v>

14
00:00:41.531 --> 00:00:45.580
<v Speaker 1>haircut philosophy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as insane as more seems Morrison,</v>

15
00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:47.290
<v Speaker 1>Mike be even crazier.</v>

16
00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:48.283
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

17
00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:51.263
<v Speaker 1>He wrote some fictional girlfriends for </v>
<v Speaker 1>a fictional version of himself in the </v>

18
00:00:54.541 --> 00:00:57.630
<v Speaker 1>invisibles and then later claimed that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they appeared in real life.</v>

19
00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:00.980
<v Speaker 3>So as a result of this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just split up with my girlfriend and a</v>

20
00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:02.510
<v Speaker 3>silky.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want a new one.</v>

21
00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:06.530
<v Speaker 3>Want it to look exactly like this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>check in the karmic cause she's cool.</v>

22
00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.550
<v Speaker 3>So I did,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said to him a monthly they oh tons up.</v>

23
00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:12.673
<v Speaker 3>Then another one.</v>

24
00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.640
<v Speaker 1>And when he wrote about this fictional </v>
<v Speaker 1>grant,</v>

25
00:01:14.641 --> 00:01:15.474
<v Speaker 1>morrison being attacked by bacterial,</v>
<v Speaker 1>God's a demonic attack and or staph </v>

26
00:01:19.291 --> 00:01:22.440
<v Speaker 1>infection brought real life grant </v>
<v Speaker 1>morrison to death's doorstep</v>

27
00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:23.443
<v Speaker 3>a that if a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if a pea coat to through the situation </v>

28
00:01:27.181 --> 00:01:28.014
<v Speaker 3>where he's been taught to what his lungs</v>
<v Speaker 3>had bust and they've just been held in </v>

29
00:01:30.781 --> 00:01:33.420
<v Speaker 3>captivity and subject until these awful </v>
<v Speaker 3>things,</v>

30
00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.420
<v Speaker 3>the months late and I'm in hospital,</v>
<v Speaker 3>two bus,</v>

31
00:01:36.421 --> 00:01:41.420
<v Speaker 3>lungs dying of blood poisoning and </v>
<v Speaker 3>facing exactly the same shamonic trial,</v>

32
00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:42.520
<v Speaker 3>put my character through</v>

33
00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:47.120
<v Speaker 1>Ben Christ appeared to him after which </v>
<v Speaker 1>he was healed and gain the superpower to</v>

34
00:01:47.121 --> 00:01:47.954
<v Speaker 1>cure cancer in cats.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But all of that pales in comparison to </v>

35
00:01:51.231 --> 00:01:52.880
<v Speaker 1>his experience in Katmandu.</v>

36
00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.730
<v Speaker 3>It'd been abducted by aliens and count </v>
<v Speaker 3>mine in 1994</v>

37
00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:57.743
<v Speaker 1>where he was abducted by rippling </v>
<v Speaker 1>dripping blobs of pure holographic </v>

38
00:02:01.021 --> 00:02:01.854
<v Speaker 1>metamaterial angels and brought to a </v>
<v Speaker 1>mega medium in which entire universes </v>

39
00:02:05.521 --> 00:02:07.770
<v Speaker 1>are suspended and shown the nature of </v>
<v Speaker 1>reality.</v>

40
00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:12.450
<v Speaker 1>Allegedly it was like a Burrito of </v>
<v Speaker 1>religious revelation and alien abduction</v>

41
00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:13.313
<v Speaker 1>all rolled into one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whether he actually ascended to a </v>

42
00:02:15.631 --> 00:02:19.230
<v Speaker 1>heavenly hyperspace or was just tripping</v>
<v Speaker 1>balls is beside the point.</v>

43
00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:22.800
<v Speaker 1>There's a surprising amount of </v>
<v Speaker 1>sober-minded philosophy and physics that</v>

44
00:02:22.801 --> 00:02:26.370
<v Speaker 1>seem to agree with certain aspects of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Morrison's Katmandu experience,</v>

45
00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:27.233
<v Speaker 1>including why he believes that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>universe is essentially just a giant </v>

46
00:02:29.911 --> 00:02:30.744
<v Speaker 1>comic book and how he's the midwife to </v>
<v Speaker 1>an incredible future wherein we become </v>

47
00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:37.500
<v Speaker 1>God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Welcome to this wisecrack edition on the</v>

48
00:02:37.501 --> 00:02:38.334
<v Speaker 1>philosophy of grant Morrison spoilers </v>
<v Speaker 1>ahead and if you want to dive even </v>

49
00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:45.900
<v Speaker 1>deeper into the mind of this mad genius,</v>
<v Speaker 1>join us over@wisecrackplus.com</v>

50
00:02:45.901 --> 00:02:49.320
<v Speaker 1>for an hour long podcast interview with </v>
<v Speaker 1>the creators of this video.</v>

51
00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:52.470
<v Speaker 1>To be clear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Morrison is not suggesting we could ever</v>

52
00:02:52.471 --> 00:02:55.380
<v Speaker 1>become the capital g God described in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Bible,</v>

53
00:02:55.381 --> 00:02:57.180
<v Speaker 1>Torah or the Quran.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

54
00:02:57.181 --> 00:03:01.780
<v Speaker 1>a single almighty creator of all things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When comic writers use the Word God,</v>

55
00:03:01.781 --> 00:03:06.010
<v Speaker 1>it's more often with a lowercase g like </v>
<v Speaker 1>the north stady turned marvel hero,</v>

56
00:03:06.011 --> 00:03:06.844
<v Speaker 1>thor or other immensely powerful beings </v>
<v Speaker 1>with this logic morrison regards of the </v>

57
00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:12.243
<v Speaker 1>Justice League as the Pantheon of </v>
<v Speaker 1>American mythology and deliberately </v>

58
00:03:14.801 --> 00:03:17.740
<v Speaker 1>structured his roster in Jla two </v>
<v Speaker 1>parallel there,</v>

59
00:03:17.741 --> 00:03:18.574
<v Speaker 1>Olympian counterparts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now we want to be very specific in </v>

60
00:03:21.041 --> 00:03:21.874
<v Speaker 1>saying that he doesn't merely mean </v>
<v Speaker 1>humans will become super power post </v>

61
00:03:24.881 --> 00:03:27.790
<v Speaker 1>humans one day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He means something much more.</v>

62
00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:29.920
<v Speaker 1>It's Captain Adam who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

63
00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:30.843
<v Speaker 1>inspired Moore's doctor Manhattan that </v>
<v Speaker 1>gives us our first hint as to what </v>

64
00:03:33.881 --> 00:03:34.714
<v Speaker 1>Morrison means by God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Both captain Adam and doctor Manhattan </v>

65
00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:40.480
<v Speaker 1>achieved God's status because of their </v>
<v Speaker 1>view of time.</v>

66
00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:43.870
<v Speaker 1>They experience every event in their </v>
<v Speaker 1>lives simultaneously.</v>

67
00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:44.973
<v Speaker 1>It's not that they have perfect recall </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the past and total knowledge of the </v>

68
00:03:47.681 --> 00:03:50.710
<v Speaker 1>future for them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is no pastor future.</v>

69
00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:53.320
<v Speaker 1>Instead,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every single moment is equally,</v>

70
00:03:53.321 --> 00:03:54.154
<v Speaker 1>eternally real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Picture a film reel as it rolls forward </v>

71
00:03:57.041 --> 00:03:57.874
<v Speaker 1>at 24 frames per second.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The light projects one image on the </v>

72
00:04:00.341 --> 00:04:02.920
<v Speaker 1>screen at any given moment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In this analogy,</v>

73
00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:06.910
<v Speaker 1>the screen is reality and only that </v>
<v Speaker 1>single frame is real,</v>

74
00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:07.893
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>frame pops into existence as the </v>

75
00:04:08.981 --> 00:04:11.680
<v Speaker 1>projector illuminates it and pops out of</v>
<v Speaker 1>existence.</v>

76
00:04:11.681 --> 00:04:12.514
<v Speaker 1>As we move on to the next frame,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is what philosopher jme mctaggart </v>

77
00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:16.443
<v Speaker 1>calls the theory of time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's how we as humans perceive time </v>

78
00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:21.093
<v Speaker 1>mactaggarts be theory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On the other hand is that events do not </v>

79
00:04:23.861 --> 00:04:24.694
<v Speaker 1>have objective tents.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So imagine if we were to eliminate each </v>

80
00:04:27.461 --> 00:04:28.294
<v Speaker 1>frame of the film reel all at once so </v>
<v Speaker 1>that we could simultaneously gaze upon </v>

81
00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:33.190
<v Speaker 1>every single moment in the movie.</v>

82
00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:36.550
<v Speaker 1>The main school of thought among be </v>
<v Speaker 1>theorists is eternalism,</v>

83
00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:37.563
<v Speaker 1>which claims every moment in time is </v>
<v Speaker 1>eternal from the big bang to the heat </v>

84
00:04:41.351 --> 00:04:42.184
<v Speaker 1>death of the universe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nothing ever pops in or out of </v>

85
00:04:44.561 --> 00:04:45.394
<v Speaker 1>existence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rather events exist alongside one </v>

86
00:04:47.621 --> 00:04:48.454
<v Speaker 1>another.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The shattering of this illusion is a </v>

87
00:04:50.261 --> 00:04:51.094
<v Speaker 1>frequent trope and morrison's writings </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the invisibles Lord Fanny's </v>

88
00:04:54.131 --> 00:04:58.060
<v Speaker 1>initiation into magic is accomplished at</v>
<v Speaker 1>the age of 11 when the remainder of fan,</v>

89
00:04:58.061 --> 00:04:58.894
<v Speaker 1>he's life getting raped and beaten and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Rio drugged out in a drag club in </v>

90
00:05:02.111 --> 00:05:02.944
<v Speaker 1>London,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even eventually dying is experienced as </v>

91
00:05:05.261 --> 00:05:06.094
<v Speaker 1>if it already happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Aztec Goddess Basil Tiotto reveals </v>

92
00:05:08.951 --> 00:05:11.050
<v Speaker 1>to Fanny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Time is not a river.</v>

93
00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:13.600
<v Speaker 1>Time is more like a bubble,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but is to a bubble.</v>

94
00:05:13.601 --> 00:05:16.480
<v Speaker 1>What a bubble is to a circle drawn on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the ground.</v>

95
00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:19.470
<v Speaker 1>So Morrison philosophizes about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>nature of time in his stories.</v>

96
00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:20.620
<v Speaker 1>Cool,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

97
00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:22.210
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he takes it further.</v>

98
00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:23.073
<v Speaker 1>Way further to Morrison.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A slightly more literal version of this </v>

99
00:05:26.111 --> 00:05:26.944
<v Speaker 1>be theory of time lies in the very </v>
<v Speaker 1>medium of the comic book on any given </v>

100
00:05:30.911 --> 00:05:32.980
<v Speaker 1>page.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you were to ask the heroes,</v>

101
00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:33.843
<v Speaker 1>they tell us that page and that panel </v>
<v Speaker 1>was the present moment so far as they </v>

102
00:05:37.601 --> 00:05:38.434
<v Speaker 1>could tell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but as the reader we see that all the </v>

103
00:05:40.751 --> 00:05:42.370
<v Speaker 1>panels,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the pages,</v>

104
00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:47.400
<v Speaker 1>all the printed issues are all equally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now their time is an illusion,</v>

105
00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:48.341
<v Speaker 1>but one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two,</v>

106
00:05:48.341 --> 00:05:49.174
<v Speaker 1>which we're not subjected.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even the two dimensional flat piece of </v>

107
00:05:52.001 --> 00:05:56.120
<v Speaker 1>paper on which comics are drawn may be </v>
<v Speaker 1>an apt analog for the structure of space</v>

108
00:05:56.121 --> 00:05:56.954
<v Speaker 1>time per morrison.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Our universe may even all be a hologram </v>

109
00:06:00.231 --> 00:06:01.064
<v Speaker 1>projected onto a flat mega membrane </v>
<v Speaker 1>which is in turn embedded along with </v>

110
00:06:05.061 --> 00:06:08.150
<v Speaker 1>many others like it within a higher </v>
<v Speaker 1>dimensional space.</v>

111
00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:11.653
<v Speaker 1>He's referring in his own way to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>holographic principle per Stephen </v>

112
00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:16.183
<v Speaker 1>Hawking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Information associated with all </v>

113
00:06:17.061 --> 00:06:21.140
<v Speaker 1>phenomenon in the three dimensional </v>
<v Speaker 1>world can be stored on a two dimensional</v>

114
00:06:21.141 --> 00:06:23.390
<v Speaker 1>boundary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a holographic image.</v>

115
00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:24.463
<v Speaker 1>In a certain sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world would be two dimensional like </v>

116
00:06:26.931 --> 00:06:28.940
<v Speaker 1>the pages of a comic book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So far.</v>

117
00:06:28.941 --> 00:06:29.774
<v Speaker 1>Everything Morrison said seems like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>reasonable conclusion to draw from </v>

118
00:06:32.661 --> 00:06:33.494
<v Speaker 1>mainstream theoretical physics and if </v>
<v Speaker 1>all he had to say was that just as a </v>

119
00:06:36.501 --> 00:06:39.170
<v Speaker 1>film reel is a fitting analogy for eight</v>
<v Speaker 1>theory.</v>

120
00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:42.980
<v Speaker 1>So two is a comic book and Apt Analogy </v>
<v Speaker 1>for the b theory of time,</v>

121
00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:45.470
<v Speaker 1>his contribution would be entirely </v>
<v Speaker 1>warranted,</v>

122
00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:50.210
<v Speaker 1>but then the cat man to experience went </v>
<v Speaker 1>down and things got weird.</v>

123
00:06:50.450 --> 00:06:51.680
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although his more out,</v>

124
00:06:51.681 --> 00:06:55.190
<v Speaker 1>their ideas don't necessarily hold up to</v>
<v Speaker 1>scientific scrutiny,</v>

125
00:06:55.250 --> 00:06:56.083
<v Speaker 1>they're still worth exploring because </v>
<v Speaker 1>they take comic books and superheroes </v>

126
00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:02.210
<v Speaker 1>stories and turn them into a compelling </v>
<v Speaker 1>worldview whether warranted or not.</v>

127
00:07:02.210 --> 00:07:06.530
<v Speaker 1>Many look to figures like superman and </v>
<v Speaker 1>captain America for moral inspiration.</v>

128
00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:10.520
<v Speaker 1>Morrison offers some justification for </v>
<v Speaker 1>emulating fictional heroes,</v>

129
00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:11.383
<v Speaker 1>treating them as gods and even go so far</v>
<v Speaker 1>as to say that the idea of superman is </v>

130
00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:20.050
<v Speaker 1>every bit as real as the idea of God and</v>
<v Speaker 1>suggest that we are even more super,</v>

131
00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:21.553
<v Speaker 1>even more godlike.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's for this reason that Morrison </v>

132
00:07:24.081 --> 00:07:24.914
<v Speaker 1>depicts philosopher Giovanni Pico de la </v>
<v Speaker 1>mere and Dola in the pages of all star </v>

133
00:07:28.611 --> 00:07:32.090
<v Speaker 1>Superman delivering his famous oration </v>
<v Speaker 1>on the dignity of man.</v>

134
00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:36.800
<v Speaker 1>As he later said in his autobiography,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pecos Oratoria is without a doubt urging</v>

135
00:07:36.801 --> 00:07:40.970
<v Speaker 1>us to go far beyond the human into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>realm of angels and Gods.</v>

136
00:07:41.090 --> 00:07:45.770
<v Speaker 1>It asks us to accept the superhuman as </v>
<v Speaker 1>an undeniable fact of our nature and the</v>

137
00:07:45.771 --> 00:07:48.230
<v Speaker 1>goal of our future evolution as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

138
00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:49.273
<v Speaker 1>Although his metaphors are biblical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>suggesting Cherubs and Sarah F's and </v>

139
00:07:52.371 --> 00:07:53.204
<v Speaker 1>thrones as our role models and </v>
<v Speaker 1>intermediaries on the road to God or </v>

140
00:07:56.031 --> 00:07:56.864
<v Speaker 1>cosmic consciousness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can just as easily call them </v>

141
00:07:58.671 --> 00:07:59.630
<v Speaker 1>superheroes.</v>

142
00:07:59.990 --> 00:08:00.823
<v Speaker 1>So what happened at Kathmandu that made </v>
<v Speaker 1>Morrison believe that the universe </v>

143
00:08:03.771 --> 00:08:07.160
<v Speaker 1>really is a comic book and that humanity</v>
<v Speaker 1>really is a superhero?</v>

144
00:08:07.370 --> 00:08:08.203
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he claims to have stepped outside the </v>

145
00:08:09.591 --> 00:08:12.890
<v Speaker 1>multiverse and seeing reality from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>outside,</v>

146
00:08:13.190 --> 00:08:16.880
<v Speaker 1>the universe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the entire space time continuum from big</v>

147
00:08:16.881 --> 00:08:17.714
<v Speaker 1>bang to heat death,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no less was not a linear stream of </v>

148
00:08:20.421 --> 00:08:22.610
<v Speaker 1>events with beginning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>middle and end.</v>

149
00:08:22.820 --> 00:08:25.100
<v Speaker 1>That was only how it felt from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>inside.</v>

150
00:08:25.250 --> 00:08:26.083
<v Speaker 1>All Life on earth was one thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a single weird anemone like mega hydro </v>

151
00:08:31.341 --> 00:08:35.330
<v Speaker 1>with its single celled and mortal route </v>
<v Speaker 1>in precambrian tides,</v>

152
00:08:35.390 --> 00:08:39.740
<v Speaker 1>a slowly complexifying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>increasingly self aware super organism.</v>

153
00:08:39.890 --> 00:08:44.600
<v Speaker 1>It was all of us all life as seen from </v>
<v Speaker 1>the perspective of a higher dimension,</v>

154
00:08:46.340 --> 00:08:47.173
<v Speaker 1>whereas eternalism his content to </v>
<v Speaker 1>conclude that spacetime is a timeless </v>

155
00:08:50.631 --> 00:08:51.464
<v Speaker 1>four dimensional object.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Morrison goes beyond eternal wisdom by </v>

156
00:08:54.381 --> 00:08:55.214
<v Speaker 1>claiming that by the same principle </v>
<v Speaker 1>every human being is actually a mere </v>

157
00:08:58.891 --> 00:09:03.270
<v Speaker 1>sell in a single super organism that is </v>
<v Speaker 1>humanity.</v>

158
00:09:03.630 --> 00:09:06.960
<v Speaker 1>And therefore if each one of us is part </v>
<v Speaker 1>of a larger hole,</v>

159
00:09:07.050 --> 00:09:12.050
<v Speaker 1>then all truism and beneficence and </v>
<v Speaker 1>charity are in our own self interest.</v>

160
00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:13.553
<v Speaker 1>The simplistic divide of right and wrong</v>
<v Speaker 1>and good and evil and superhero comics </v>

161
00:09:16.890 --> 00:09:17.723
<v Speaker 1>suddenly seems less silly because our </v>
<v Speaker 1>morals aren't arbitrary social </v>

162
00:09:21.151 --> 00:09:21.984
<v Speaker 1>constructs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're the genetic programming </v>

163
00:09:23.610 --> 00:09:27.480
<v Speaker 1>instructing this super organism not to </v>
<v Speaker 1>destroy itself.</v>

164
00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:28.553
<v Speaker 1>Indeed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this view as a basis for ethics is the </v>

165
00:09:30.601 --> 00:09:31.434
<v Speaker 1>very conclusion lex luthor reaches when </v>
<v Speaker 1>he gains Superman's powers and upon </v>

166
00:09:35.131 --> 00:09:35.964
<v Speaker 1>seeing with his super senses all of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamental forces and how they're </v>

167
00:09:38.641 --> 00:09:40.740
<v Speaker 1>interconnected,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he begins to weep.</v>

168
00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:41.933
<v Speaker 1>This is how he sees all the time every </v>
<v Speaker 1>day like it's all just us in here </v>

169
00:09:46.561 --> 00:09:49.260
<v Speaker 1>together and we're all we've got,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

170
00:09:49.261 --> 00:09:52.320
<v Speaker 1>so if humanity as a whole is like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>superhero comic book,</v>

171
00:09:52.350 --> 00:09:55.800
<v Speaker 1>we should therefore behave like these </v>
<v Speaker 1>costume do gooders.</v>

172
00:09:55.920 --> 00:09:58.530
<v Speaker 1>It's a compelling case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you think that's weird,</v>

173
00:09:58.590 --> 00:10:02.650
<v Speaker 1>he also saw fifth dimensional aliens or </v>
<v Speaker 1>what he called mercurial,</v>

174
00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:03.593
<v Speaker 1>hyper sprites,</v>
<v Speaker 1>five dimensional intelligence as could </v>

175
00:10:06.030 --> 00:10:09.090
<v Speaker 1>as a condition of their geometrically </v>
<v Speaker 1>elevated position.</v>

176
00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:09.953
<v Speaker 1>Get into our skulls quite easily and we </v>
<v Speaker 1>could expect their voices to come from </v>

177
00:10:13.771 --> 00:10:14.604
<v Speaker 1>inside.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They in turn could hear our thoughts as </v>

178
00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:21.900
<v Speaker 1>easily as we can read Batman's private </v>
<v Speaker 1>inner monologues on a two d page.</v>

179
00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:25.740
<v Speaker 1>This is illustrated in multiversity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pax Americana Number One,</v>

180
00:10:25.980 --> 00:10:29.490
<v Speaker 1>while reading a comic book Captain Adam </v>
<v Speaker 1>uses to two scientists.</v>

181
00:10:29.610 --> 00:10:30.443
<v Speaker 1>The stories linear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I can flip through the pages in any </v>

182
00:10:33.211 --> 00:10:35.400
<v Speaker 1>order,</v>
<v Speaker 1>any direction forward in time.</v>

183
00:10:35.401 --> 00:10:37.860
<v Speaker 1>To the conclusion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>back to the opening scene,</v>

184
00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:40.530
<v Speaker 1>the characters remained unaware of my </v>
<v Speaker 1>scrutiny,</v>

185
00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:44.310
<v Speaker 1>but their thoughts are transparent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>weightless and little clouds.</v>

186
00:10:44.520 --> 00:10:47.250
<v Speaker 1>This is how a two dimensional continuum </v>
<v Speaker 1>looks to you.</v>

187
00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:49.560
<v Speaker 1>Then staring straight ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He says,</v>

188
00:10:49.620 --> 00:10:52.470
<v Speaker 1>imagine how your three d world appears </v>
<v Speaker 1>to me.</v>

189
00:10:52.890 --> 00:10:53.723
<v Speaker 1>Adam's fourth wall break brings us to </v>
<v Speaker 1>another major theme in Morrison's Works </v>

190
00:10:56.910 --> 00:10:57.743
<v Speaker 1>Meta fiction Alec,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the exploration of the </v>

191
00:10:59.221 --> 00:11:00.054
<v Speaker 1>relationship between the fiction itself </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the real world of the writer and </v>

192
00:11:03.751 --> 00:11:04.584
<v Speaker 1>reader Morrison first wrestled with </v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] in the final issue of his </v>

193
00:11:07.711 --> 00:11:12.210
<v Speaker 1>run on animal man in which he dawned </v>
<v Speaker 1>what he calls a fiction suit.</v>

194
00:11:12.420 --> 00:11:17.190
<v Speaker 1>He inserts himself into the comic itself</v>
<v Speaker 1>to interact with the character he notes.</v>

195
00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:18.113
<v Speaker 1>I explained to my character how the </v>
<v Speaker 1>people who wrote his life needed drama </v>

196
00:11:21.541 --> 00:11:24.210
<v Speaker 1>and shock and violence to make his story</v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting.</v>

197
00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:25.193
<v Speaker 1>The implication was that our own lives </v>
<v Speaker 1>may be written to entertain or to </v>

198
00:11:28.621 --> 00:11:30.930
<v Speaker 1>instruct an audience in a perpendicular </v>
<v Speaker 1>direction.</v>

199
00:11:30.931 --> 00:11:35.370
<v Speaker 1>We could never point to interacting with</v>
<v Speaker 1>us in ways we could scarcely understand,</v>

200
00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:36.233
<v Speaker 1>but that could be divided in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship of the comic world to the </v>

201
00:11:39.121 --> 00:11:39.954
<v Speaker 1>world of the Creator and audience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the crux that connects </v>

202
00:11:42.691 --> 00:11:45.540
<v Speaker 1>Morrison's metta fiction to his musings </v>
<v Speaker 1>on spacetime.</v>

203
00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:48.810
<v Speaker 1>If comic books reflect the nature of our</v>
<v Speaker 1>universe,</v>

204
00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:49.673
<v Speaker 1>can we say that the physical comic like </v>
<v Speaker 1>universe reflects the nature of some </v>

205
00:11:53.321 --> 00:11:54.154
<v Speaker 1>higher reality?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who are our cosmic comic creators who </v>

206
00:11:57.761 --> 00:12:00.070
<v Speaker 1>writes the plotlines of history,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pencils,</v>

207
00:12:00.071 --> 00:12:01.750
<v Speaker 1>the particle interactions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>letters,</v>

208
00:12:01.751 --> 00:12:03.700
<v Speaker 1>the thought balloons of intelligent </v>
<v Speaker 1>minds?</v>

209
00:12:03.910 --> 00:12:04.743
<v Speaker 1>Morrison's answer is the fifth </v>
<v Speaker 1>dimensional aliens that we cannot grasp </v>

210
00:12:07.961 --> 00:12:08.794
<v Speaker 1>with our feeble three dimensional mines,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he admits the particulars are less </v>

211
00:12:11.591 --> 00:12:12.424
<v Speaker 1>important than the implications that </v>
<v Speaker 1>follow from there being intelligent </v>

212
00:12:15.071 --> 00:12:15.904
<v Speaker 1>designers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If the analogy of our universe being </v>

213
00:12:17.711 --> 00:12:18.544
<v Speaker 1>like a comic book extends so far as to </v>
<v Speaker 1>suggest that it has something like a </v>

214
00:12:21.371 --> 00:12:22.204
<v Speaker 1>writer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then the mere fact that it is a written </v>

215
00:12:24.191 --> 00:12:27.610
<v Speaker 1>work implies a purposefulness to our </v>
<v Speaker 1>existence.</v>

216
00:12:27.970 --> 00:12:28.631
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>

217
00:12:28.631 --> 00:12:31.720
<v Speaker 1>being created doesn't necessarily in </v>
<v Speaker 1>part dignity,</v>

218
00:12:31.900 --> 00:12:32.733
<v Speaker 1>we might be like morrisons animal man </v>
<v Speaker 1>with all our suffering for no greater </v>

219
00:12:35.591 --> 00:12:38.860
<v Speaker 1>purpose can to provide drama in a piece </v>
<v Speaker 1>of cheap entertainment.</v>

220
00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:39.873
<v Speaker 1>We might be made by a hack.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Our whole purpose might be to pass </v>

221
00:12:42.551 --> 00:12:44.650
<v Speaker 1>butter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but contra his younger self.</v>

222
00:12:44.651 --> 00:12:45.484
<v Speaker 1>When writing animal man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more mature Morrison became more </v>

223
00:12:48.221 --> 00:12:51.610
<v Speaker 1>optimistic in flex men,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tallow man of muscle mystery.</v>

224
00:12:51.700 --> 00:12:56.110
<v Speaker 1>Morrison once again used [inaudible] as </v>
<v Speaker 1>a means of exploring questions about our</v>

225
00:12:56.111 --> 00:12:56.944
<v Speaker 1>own purpose.</v>

226
00:12:57.130 --> 00:12:57.963
<v Speaker 1>Just as Morrison sees,</v>
<v Speaker 1>reality is having a three tiered </v>

227
00:13:00.191 --> 00:13:02.770
<v Speaker 1>structure with his fifth dimensional </v>
<v Speaker 1>emcee at the top,</v>

228
00:13:03.190 --> 00:13:06.940
<v Speaker 1>the two d comic book characters at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>bottom and us in the middle.</v>

229
00:13:07.420 --> 00:13:11.800
<v Speaker 1>So two is the story of flexpen tallow </v>
<v Speaker 1>set across three levels of reality.</v>

230
00:13:12.040 --> 00:13:14.170
<v Speaker 1>There's the cartoon world of Flex </v>
<v Speaker 1>Metallo.</v>

231
00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:19.570
<v Speaker 1>The realistic world of Flexes Writer </v>
<v Speaker 1>Wall is sage and Avatar,</v>

232
00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:20.433
<v Speaker 1>Morrison himself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and yet a higher reality inhabited by </v>

233
00:13:22.571 --> 00:13:27.190
<v Speaker 1>superheroes more real than they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>writers or the fifth dimensional aliens.</v>

234
00:13:28.210 --> 00:13:30.550
<v Speaker 1>In the story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's revealed that superheroes,</v>

235
00:13:30.580 --> 00:13:34.630
<v Speaker 1>instead of being merely a product of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>imagination of writers like wally,</v>

236
00:13:34.780 --> 00:13:35.613
<v Speaker 1>were in fact the beings that created </v>
<v Speaker 1>wally's entire world after which they </v>

237
00:13:39.341 --> 00:13:40.174
<v Speaker 1>retreated in the imagination,</v>
<v Speaker 1>seeding our culture with superhero </v>

238
00:13:43.001 --> 00:13:43.834
<v Speaker 1>stories in anticipation of the day that </v>
<v Speaker 1>mere mortals are ready to become like </v>

239
00:13:47.621 --> 00:13:48.940
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As a result,</v>

240
00:13:49.030 --> 00:13:52.690
<v Speaker 1>humanity only needs to resolve their </v>
<v Speaker 1>uncertainty about whether superheros are</v>

241
00:13:52.691 --> 00:13:53.524
<v Speaker 1>real or not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and decide to believe them into </v>

242
00:13:55.421 --> 00:13:56.254
<v Speaker 1>existence here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Morrison to suggesting a much more </v>

243
00:13:58.031 --> 00:14:00.190
<v Speaker 1>dignified purpose to our existence.</v>

244
00:14:00.280 --> 00:14:01.113
<v Speaker 1>We're meant to discover our fundamental </v>
<v Speaker 1>purpose in the pages of comic books and </v>

245
00:14:04.871 --> 00:14:05.704
<v Speaker 1>to believe into existence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The idea of the superman to incarnate </v>

246
00:14:09.131 --> 00:14:09.964
<v Speaker 1>him in ourselves for Morrison,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the medium of comics and the plot </v>

247
00:14:13.481 --> 00:14:17.530
<v Speaker 1>structure of superhero stories are so </v>
<v Speaker 1>closely connected in our culture because</v>

248
00:14:17.531 --> 00:14:22.060
<v Speaker 1>both are parts of the same pattern that </v>
<v Speaker 1>explained everything else in existence.</v>

249
00:14:22.360 --> 00:14:26.080
<v Speaker 1>In recognizing this pattern,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Morrison writes his own autobiography,</v>

250
00:14:26.081 --> 00:14:30.550
<v Speaker 1>Super Gods in the style and structure of</v>
<v Speaker 1>an archetypical superhero story,</v>

251
00:14:30.700 --> 00:14:34.000
<v Speaker 1>including a secret origin in Glasgow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the call to adventure,</v>

252
00:14:34.001 --> 00:14:34.834
<v Speaker 1>a top Katmandu and a death and rebirth </v>
<v Speaker 1>in which he brings the hidden knowledge </v>

253
00:14:38.161 --> 00:14:41.350
<v Speaker 1>he gained on his hero's journey to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>comics community,</v>

254
00:14:41.710 --> 00:14:42.543
<v Speaker 1>and while that hidden knowledge is </v>
<v Speaker 1>parsed out in piecemeal and his comics </v>

255
00:14:45.131 --> 00:14:45.964
<v Speaker 1>writing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's in super gods where he's most </v>

256
00:14:47.681 --> 00:14:52.010
<v Speaker 1>explicit about just what makes humankind</v>
<v Speaker 1>itself a Super God.</v>

257
00:14:52.250 --> 00:14:53.083
<v Speaker 1>Already we can see humankind is having </v>
<v Speaker 1>all the attributes of comic book </v>

258
00:14:55.911 --> 00:14:58.190
<v Speaker 1>superheroes or even Pagan Gods.</v>

259
00:14:58.310 --> 00:15:01.880
<v Speaker 1>Whereas mercury carried messages at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>speed of thought to the Roman gods.</v>

260
00:15:01.970 --> 00:15:05.150
<v Speaker 1>We have instantaneous interconnectivity </v>
<v Speaker 1>via the internet,</v>

261
00:15:05.270 --> 00:15:06.103
<v Speaker 1>whereas heme dolls all seeing I could </v>
<v Speaker 1>spy everywhere in all nine realms are </v>

262
00:15:09.711 --> 00:15:13.370
<v Speaker 1>satellites can zoom in on any spot on </v>
<v Speaker 1>earth like superman.</v>

263
00:15:13.371 --> 00:15:14.204
<v Speaker 1>We flown faster than a speeding bullet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Humanity when viewed as a whole is </v>

264
00:15:18.021 --> 00:15:18.854
<v Speaker 1>already a super God insofar as there is </v>
<v Speaker 1>no future frames of the film reel </v>

265
00:15:23.001 --> 00:15:26.420
<v Speaker 1>popping into existence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We are not becoming the Super God.</v>

266
00:15:26.570 --> 00:15:31.190
<v Speaker 1>We already always are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This epic of human history is merely its</v>

267
00:15:31.191 --> 00:15:35.210
<v Speaker 1>secret origin story as to how it gets </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's superhuman powers,</v>

268
00:15:35.300 --> 00:15:36.133
<v Speaker 1>but all of its ongoing adventures and </v>
<v Speaker 1>never ending battles to come are all </v>

269
00:15:39.560 --> 00:15:41.390
<v Speaker 1>already written,</v>
<v Speaker 1>published,</v>

270
00:15:41.391 --> 00:15:42.224
<v Speaker 1>printed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and on the shelves of some higher </v>

271
00:15:43.911 --> 00:15:44.744
<v Speaker 1>dimensional comic shop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If mankind is this super organism with </v>

272
00:15:48.111 --> 00:15:48.944
<v Speaker 1>all these stupendous powers who supposed</v>
<v Speaker 1>to act according to the simple morality </v>

273
00:15:52.340 --> 00:15:53.173
<v Speaker 1>of a superhero whose whole history is </v>
<v Speaker 1>structured like a superhero story and </v>

274
00:15:56.691 --> 00:16:00.110
<v Speaker 1>who's living in a cosmos that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>constructed like a comic book,</v>

275
00:16:00.260 --> 00:16:02.810
<v Speaker 1>then Morrison's obvious conclusion is </v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

276
00:16:02.930 --> 00:16:07.930
<v Speaker 1>Mankind's purpose is to be a superhero.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's for this reason that Morrison calls</v>

277
00:16:08.031 --> 00:16:08.864
<v Speaker 1>the Sun God from Smallville,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our greatest ever idea as the human </v>

278
00:16:12.141 --> 00:16:12.974
<v Speaker 1>species.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not because superman was the prototype </v>

279
00:16:14.781 --> 00:16:16.910
<v Speaker 1>on which all other superheroes would be </v>
<v Speaker 1>based,</v>

280
00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:19.760
<v Speaker 1>but because he is the template for which</v>
<v Speaker 1>these Super God,</v>

281
00:16:19.761 --> 00:16:24.761
<v Speaker 1>if humanity must become all powerful and</v>
<v Speaker 1>all good all at the same time.</v>

282
00:16:25.370 --> 00:16:29.600
<v Speaker 1>This is the summation of Morrison's </v>
<v Speaker 1>philosophy articulated Bestbuy Jarell to</v>

283
00:16:29.601 --> 00:16:30.434
<v Speaker 1>his one and only son regarding the </v>
<v Speaker 1>essential truth about man and superman </v>

284
00:16:34.280 --> 00:16:38.210
<v Speaker 1>and not the mankind within the comics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the mankind reading comics.</v>

285
00:16:38.360 --> 00:16:43.290
<v Speaker 1>You have given them an ideal to aspire </v>
<v Speaker 1>to embodied their highest aspirations.</v>

286
00:16:43.370 --> 00:16:44.203
<v Speaker 1>They will race and stumble and fall and </v>
<v Speaker 1>crawl and curse and finally they will </v>
