<v Speaker 1>Christian Bale.</v>

8
00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:31.930
<v Speaker 1>The film takes place in 1989.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Give or take a millennium.</v>

9
00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.540
<v Speaker 1>Our protagonist is human investment </v>
<v Speaker 1>banker,</v>

10
00:00:34.541 --> 00:00:37.240
<v Speaker 1>Patrick Batman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he's got it all.</v>

11
00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:38.153
<v Speaker 1>I'll legally blonde girlfriend,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two layers of skin and a brain disease </v>

12
00:00:41.171 --> 00:00:44.260
<v Speaker 1>that makes them old murdery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One day his work friend,</v>

13
00:00:44.261 --> 00:00:46.540
<v Speaker 1>jared Letterman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gets his driver's license,</v>

14
00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:48.480
<v Speaker 1>making Patrick's Learner's permit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

15
00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:51.970
<v Speaker 1>admittedly pretty condemned to bury the </v>
<v Speaker 1>hatchet.</v>

16
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.440
<v Speaker 1>He invites him over for some rhythm of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the night and buries the hatchets.</v>

17
00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:01.720
<v Speaker 1>Patrick leaves a facetime audio cover up</v>
<v Speaker 1>and a grossly inaccurate terminator.</v>

18
00:01:01.721 --> 00:01:03.420
<v Speaker 1>Impression,</v>
<v Speaker 1>baby.</v>

19
00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:04.683
<v Speaker 1>Pretty soon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Norman Osborn starts asking questions </v>

20
00:01:06.791 --> 00:01:08.920
<v Speaker 1>about Letterman's disappearance from </v>
<v Speaker 1>late night,</v>

21
00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:11.380
<v Speaker 1>if only to inject some plot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Luckily,</v>

22
00:01:11.381 --> 00:01:15.700
<v Speaker 1>he's not really into facts will just </v>
<v Speaker 1>disappear and they leave it at that.</v>

23
00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:17.470
<v Speaker 1>Later that night,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Patrick asks,</v>

24
00:01:17.471 --> 00:01:18.304
<v Speaker 1>too lovable prostitutes to star in his </v>
<v Speaker 1>porno Chitty Chitty Bang Bang and wraps </v>

25
00:01:22.181 --> 00:01:24.490
<v Speaker 1>production.</v>
<v Speaker 1>After the big coat hanger scene,</v>

26
00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:28.180
<v Speaker 1>we're not through yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When the Hooli CEO gets his license,</v>

27
00:01:28.181 --> 00:01:32.680
<v Speaker 1>Patrick hops back on the murder train,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but learns that he's gay and stops since</v>

28
00:01:32.681 --> 00:01:34.750
<v Speaker 1>that would be a hate crime to clear his </v>
<v Speaker 1>head.</v>

29
00:01:34.751 --> 00:01:38.980
<v Speaker 1>He books the prostitute for a sequel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but totally forgets to tidy up his pad.</v>

30
00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:42.370
<v Speaker 1>She's such a neat freak.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She leaves without taking her chainsaw,</v>

31
00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:44.580
<v Speaker 1>forcing patrick to throw on some </v>
<v Speaker 1>clothes,</v>

32
00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:45.643
<v Speaker 3>turn it</v>

33
00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:48.503
<v Speaker 1>the next night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Patrick remembers his pin and forgets </v>

34
00:01:50.491 --> 00:01:52.920
<v Speaker 1>his cat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When a woman tries to cut in line,</v>

35
00:01:52.921 --> 00:01:56.580
<v Speaker 1>Batman tells her to wait and hell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fas asked what happened,</v>

36
00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:57.473
<v Speaker 1>so patrick shows them he gives a janitor</v>
<v Speaker 1>and security guards some time off </v>

37
00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:05.910
<v Speaker 1>because he's such a nice guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then booty calls his lawyer.</v>

38
00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:09.030
<v Speaker 1>Whoops.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The following morning,</v>

39
00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.910
<v Speaker 1>patrick shocked to find his place spic </v>
<v Speaker 1>and span decks,</v>

40
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.833
<v Speaker 1>even though is Roomba broke forever ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The film ends with Patrick running into </v>

41
00:02:16.321 --> 00:02:19.500
<v Speaker 1>his lawyer and an astonishing Pepsi </v>
<v Speaker 1>twist is revealed.</v>

42
00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:23.790
<v Speaker 1>The lawyer doesn't charge for the our </v>
<v Speaker 1>American psycho,</v>

43
00:02:23.791 --> 00:02:27.810
<v Speaker 1>satirizes consumer as values through its</v>
<v Speaker 1>portrayal of Wall Street yuppies.</v>

44
00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:32.760
<v Speaker 1>Long before bitcoin became sentient and </v>
<v Speaker 1>blew up Guam for Patrick and Co,</v>

45
00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:33.623
<v Speaker 1>meaning comes through what you own </v>
<v Speaker 1>reflecting the philosophy of Herbie </v>

46
00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:37.350
<v Speaker 1>fully loaded.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mark,</v>

47
00:02:37.351 --> 00:02:39.720
<v Speaker 1>who's up in his book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one dimensional man,</v>

48
00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:40.583
<v Speaker 1>he writes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people recognize themselves in their </v>

49
00:02:41.971 --> 00:02:43.770
<v Speaker 1>commodities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in their automobile.</v>

50
00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:46.770
<v Speaker 1>Hi Fi set,</v>
<v Speaker 1>split level home and kitchen equipment.</v>

51
00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:49.800
<v Speaker 1>Personally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I recognize myself in my space,</v>

52
00:02:49.801 --> 00:02:52.950
<v Speaker 1>Jacuzzi,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the film lampoons the trivial pursuit of</v>

53
00:02:52.951 --> 00:02:53.784
<v Speaker 1>status.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When Batman and his colleagues compare </v>

54
00:02:55.351 --> 00:02:59.160
<v Speaker 1>business cards to the casual observer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're all Comic Sans,</v>

55
00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:01.750
<v Speaker 1>but in Patrick's world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this becomes a tense power,</v>

56
00:03:01.751 --> 00:03:03.760
<v Speaker 1>struggle over the slightest </v>
<v Speaker 1>distinctions.</v>

57
00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:06.210
<v Speaker 1>That's subtle enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Way Coloring tasteful thing.</v>

58
00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.260
<v Speaker 1>Patrick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're sweating.</v>

59
00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:09.393
<v Speaker 1>Similarly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the traders have become </v>

60
00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:12.190
<v Speaker 1>indistinguishable from each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

61
00:03:12.191 --> 00:03:15.280
<v Speaker 1>they're all mammals to me and beneath </v>
<v Speaker 1>the flashy exterior,</v>

62
00:03:15.281 --> 00:03:16.114
<v Speaker 1>there's no substance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I simply am not the film comments on </v>

63
00:03:20.951 --> 00:03:23.890
<v Speaker 1>humans' preoccupation with looking </v>
<v Speaker 1>mighty fine.</v>

64
00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:27.490
<v Speaker 1>Often on instagram.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People are so obsessed with Batman,</v>

65
00:03:27.491 --> 00:03:29.950
<v Speaker 1>superficial qualities that they failed </v>
<v Speaker 1>to notice.</v>

66
00:03:29.951 --> 00:03:32.440
<v Speaker 1>He's gotten a haircut.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to dissect girls.</v>

67
00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:35.590
<v Speaker 1>Did you know I'm utterly insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Great Tan Marcus.</v>

68
00:03:35.591 --> 00:03:39.130
<v Speaker 1>I mean really impressive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When Louis Sees Batman struggling with a</v>

69
00:03:39.131 --> 00:03:42.250
<v Speaker 1>suspicious bag,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all he cares about is who designed it.</v>

70
00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:46.270
<v Speaker 1>Where did you get that overnight bag?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The cost of his sheets is more important</v>

71
00:03:46.271 --> 00:03:48.970
<v Speaker 1>than the fact that they are clearly </v>
<v Speaker 1>covered in cranberry juice.</v>

72
00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:53.110
<v Speaker 1>I can only get these sheets in Santa Fe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These are using visual imagery.</v>

73
00:03:53.111 --> 00:03:53.944
<v Speaker 1>The film draws a connection between </v>
<v Speaker 1>Patrick's violent tendencies and his </v>

74
00:03:56.891 --> 00:03:57.724
<v Speaker 1>material girl ism what appears to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>droplets of blood turns out to be a </v>

75
00:04:00.881 --> 00:04:04.050
<v Speaker 1>supreme really decadent sauce called </v>
<v Speaker 1>Saracha.</v>

76
00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:05.133
<v Speaker 1>Batman's call for dinner reservations is</v>
<v Speaker 1>juxtaposed with some pretty hardcore </v>

77
00:04:08.561 --> 00:04:09.394
<v Speaker 1>pornography.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Although I've seen worse when we see </v>

78
00:04:12.131 --> 00:04:15.490
<v Speaker 1>Batman's victims hanging in the closet </v>
<v Speaker 1>like Valentino suits,</v>

79
00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:18.700
<v Speaker 1>we realized that to him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>human beings have been reduced to a mere</v>

80
00:04:18.701 --> 00:04:21.280
<v Speaker 1>commodities and a bold fashion </v>
<v Speaker 1>statements.</v>

81
00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:23.830
<v Speaker 1>As Patrick's behavior grows more </v>
<v Speaker 1>erratic,</v>

82
00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:24.723
<v Speaker 1>we begin to wonder how much of this </v>
<v Speaker 1>documentary is real when he visits </v>

83
00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:28.603
<v Speaker 1>letterman's apartment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rather than encountering bodies and </v>

84
00:04:30.431 --> 00:04:31.264
<v Speaker 1>blood soaked walls,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he meets only a realtor and a crazy low </v>

85
00:04:34.031 --> 00:04:34.864
<v Speaker 1>asking price,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and as lawyer appears to contradict his </v>

86
00:04:37.241 --> 00:04:38.590
<v Speaker 1>confession,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I killed.</v>

87
00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:42.100
<v Speaker 1>That's simply not possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why isn't it possible?</v>

88
00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:45.910
<v Speaker 1>Because I had dinner with Paul Island </v>
<v Speaker 1>twice in London just 10 days ago.</v>

89
00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:50.230
<v Speaker 1>These disparities could suggest Batman's</v>
<v Speaker 1>world is so jaded towards money.</v>

90
00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:53.620
<v Speaker 1>A realtor would whitewash a murder house</v>
<v Speaker 1>to get a good zillow.</v>

91
00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:57.010
<v Speaker 1>It could also suggest Batman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Story is a fantasy,</v>

92
00:04:57.190 --> 00:04:58.023
<v Speaker 1>a warning that in such a culture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the potential for maniacal violence </v>

93
00:05:01.181 --> 00:05:02.860
<v Speaker 1>could lurk inside any of them,</v>

94
