1
00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:05.130
<v Speaker 1>A wise crack,</v>
<v Speaker 1>jared here today,</v>

2
00:00:05.131 --> 00:00:05.964
<v Speaker 1>we're diving deep into the world of </v>
<v Speaker 1>metal gear solid now because doing a </v>

3
00:00:08.671 --> 00:00:12.360
<v Speaker 1>full scale philosophy of would be an </v>
<v Speaker 1>arsenal gear scale undertaking.</v>

4
00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:14.610
<v Speaker 1>We decided to focus on something else </v>
<v Speaker 1>today,</v>

5
00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.460
<v Speaker 1>the enigmatic nature of its Creator </v>
<v Speaker 1>Studio Jima.</v>

6
00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.030
<v Speaker 1>Not only will we be talking about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>underlying themes of the games,</v>

7
00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:21.923
<v Speaker 1>but also how Kajima has inserted himself</v>
<v Speaker 1>into these games in an unprecedented </v>

8
00:00:25.741 --> 00:00:28.020
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nowadays.</v>

9
00:00:28.021 --> 00:00:28.854
<v Speaker 1>It's not uncommon to have a small indie </v>
<v Speaker 1>game tell a personal story from its </v>

10
00:00:31.591 --> 00:00:32.424
<v Speaker 1>creator,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it is uncommon to see that happen </v>

11
00:00:34.321 --> 00:00:37.380
<v Speaker 1>with a big budget cinematic thriller </v>
<v Speaker 1>like metal gear solid.</v>

12
00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:41.730
<v Speaker 1>These games aren't just a collection of </v>
<v Speaker 1>stories about solid snake in big boss.</v>

13
00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.750
<v Speaker 1>They're also about co Gima and his place</v>
<v Speaker 1>in video gaming at the time.</v>

14
00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.030
<v Speaker 1>In a funny way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>life imitates art.</v>

15
00:00:48.031 --> 00:00:48.864
<v Speaker 1>Here you have a narrative arc going from</v>
<v Speaker 1>upbeat poppy spy adventures to </v>

16
00:00:51.991 --> 00:00:52.824
<v Speaker 1>Nihilistic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anti American cynicism as coaching his </v>

17
00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.420
<v Speaker 1>relationship with Konami Sour,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but now with those shackles fried,</v>

18
00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:02.250
<v Speaker 1>he's off to make whatever weird thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>this is,</v>

19
00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:05.190
<v Speaker 1>but before Koji,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Miss Games became gut punching,</v>

20
00:01:05.191 --> 00:01:06.450
<v Speaker 1>self critical studies.</v>

21
00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:07.373
<v Speaker 1>They started off as a Kurt Russell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rip off welcome to this wise crack </v>

22
00:01:10.291 --> 00:01:14.160
<v Speaker 1>edition on co Gima and metal gear solid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but before we get into it,</v>

23
00:01:14.161 --> 00:01:15.780
<v Speaker 1>we wanted to give a shout out to our </v>
<v Speaker 1>sponsor,</v>

24
00:01:15.781 --> 00:01:16.614
<v Speaker 1>audible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who enabled us to finally dive into the </v>

25
00:01:17.971 --> 00:01:18.804
<v Speaker 1>crazy world of metal gear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to get into this in a hot </v>

26
00:01:20.671 --> 00:01:21.504
<v Speaker 1>second,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but Winco Jima created the world with </v>

27
00:01:22.621 --> 00:01:23.454
<v Speaker 1>metal gear solid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was actually inspired by Richard </v>

28
00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:26.820
<v Speaker 1>Dawkins,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the selfish gene.</v>

29
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.800
<v Speaker 1>I call him Dickie Dee because we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>tight.</v>

30
00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:29.813
<v Speaker 1>You can learn about the very ideas that </v>
<v Speaker 1>inspired him to Yoko Gina's work while </v>

31
00:01:32.161 --> 00:01:32.994
<v Speaker 1>still playing his games,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'll get more into that later to </v>

32
00:01:34.801 --> 00:01:38.090

<v Speaker 1>Thanks to audible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

43
00:02:02.851 --> 00:02:05.130
<v Speaker 1>and watch out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Major spoilers ahead.</v>

44
00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.480
<v Speaker 1>The seventies were a decade when </v>
<v Speaker 1>visionary American directors were making</v>

45
00:02:09.481 --> 00:02:13.170
<v Speaker 1>masterpiece after masterpiece with </v>
<v Speaker 1>directors getting top billing,</v>

46
00:02:13.171 --> 00:02:15.120
<v Speaker 1>discreet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>artistically mature works.</v>

47
00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:16.133
<v Speaker 1>A whole generation of kids grew up </v>
<v Speaker 1>wanting to make their mark on the world </v>

48
00:02:18.871 --> 00:02:22.290
<v Speaker 1>through movies and video.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kojima was right there among them,</v>

49
00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:25.950
<v Speaker 1>but as fate would have it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gaming would be the outlet for Cucina to</v>

50
00:02:25.951 --> 00:02:26.784
<v Speaker 1>express his cinematic ambitions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first two metal gear games are full </v>

51
00:02:29.761 --> 00:02:32.070
<v Speaker 1>of references to coaching was favorite </v>
<v Speaker 1>action movies.</v>

52
00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:36.000
<v Speaker 1>The whole concept of self gameplay was </v>
<v Speaker 1>inspired by these sneaking scenes of the</v>

53
00:02:36.001 --> 00:02:37.710
<v Speaker 1>great escape.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the bosses,</v>

54
00:02:37.711 --> 00:02:39.810
<v Speaker 1>a duo of unstoppable cyborgs.</v>

55
00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:43.470
<v Speaker 1>We're straight up terminators originally</v>
<v Speaker 1>called Arnold's and snakes.</v>

56
00:02:43.471 --> 00:02:44.304
<v Speaker 1>Codename was ripped directly from </v>
<v Speaker 1>Russell's character in escape from New </v>

57
00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:47.843
<v Speaker 1>York.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a snake who gene was earlier </v>

58
00:02:51.271 --> 00:02:52.104
<v Speaker 1>works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Police knots and snatcher were </v>

59
00:02:53.341 --> 00:02:57.510
<v Speaker 1>respectively animate up Japanese takes </v>
<v Speaker 1>on lethal weapon and blade runner,</v>

60
00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:58.613
<v Speaker 1>but it was the advent of three d gaming </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the late nineties that gave Kajima a </v>

61
00:03:01.781 --> 00:03:04.600
<v Speaker 1>truly cinematic canvas to work with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Suddenly,</v>

62
00:03:04.601 --> 00:03:07.420
<v Speaker 1>video games needed cinematography and </v>
<v Speaker 1>performances,</v>

63
00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:10.570
<v Speaker 1>so Kajima made snake even more of a Kurt</v>
<v Speaker 1>Russell rip off.</v>

64
00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:11.643
<v Speaker 1>My name is Pliska.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The solid snake of metal gear solid was </v>

65
00:03:14.651 --> 00:03:15.484
<v Speaker 1>so close to snake skin that years later </v>
<v Speaker 1>the film's rights holders actually </v>

66
00:03:18.911 --> 00:03:21.670
<v Speaker 1>wanted to sue until John Carpenter </v>
<v Speaker 1>stopped them,</v>

67
00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:22.923
<v Speaker 1>but beyond his obvious love for movies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can also see a kind of optimism and </v>

68
00:03:26.321 --> 00:03:29.830
<v Speaker 1>metal gear solid what I understand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but why metal gear,</v>

69
00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:30.723
<v Speaker 1>the nuclear age ended with the turn of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the millennium writing a spy adventure </v>

70
00:03:33.491 --> 00:03:34.324
<v Speaker 1>in the late nineties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shortly after the Cold War has snake </v>

71
00:03:36.311 --> 00:03:37.480
<v Speaker 1>saying things like this.</v>

72
00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:38.423
<v Speaker 2>Russia today has enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're struggling between freedom and </v>

73
00:03:41.551 --> 00:03:43.290
<v Speaker 2>order,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and with that struggle,</v>

74
00:03:43.291 --> 00:03:45.420
<v Speaker 2>a new spirit of nationalism is born</v>

75
00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:49.620
<v Speaker 1>given the enormous economic decline </v>
<v Speaker 1>Russia faced after the Cold War.</v>

76
00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:51.840
<v Speaker 1>Snakes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>words might sound naive today,</v>

77
00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:52.913
<v Speaker 1>but they fit right into an upbeat </v>
<v Speaker 1>feeling of peace and prosperity for the </v>

78
00:03:55.801 --> 00:03:57.330
<v Speaker 1>West.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Complete with a villain,</v>

79
00:03:57.331 --> 00:03:59.860
<v Speaker 1>frustrated over a world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gone soft off,</v>

80
00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:03.040
<v Speaker 1>throwing the launch this weapon and get </v>
<v Speaker 1>a billion dollars.</v>

81
00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:08.290
<v Speaker 1>We'll be able to bring chaos and back to</v>
<v Speaker 1>this world soft.</v>

82
00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:12.030
<v Speaker 1>This is metal gear solid at its most </v>
<v Speaker 1>optimistic,</v>

83
00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:16.020
<v Speaker 1>but it's all downhill from here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In December of 1999,</v>

84
00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:16.883
<v Speaker 1>the Ria filed a lawsuit against napster.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cocina thought the idea of the US </v>

85
00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:21.353
<v Speaker 1>government controlling how people shared</v>
<v Speaker 1>music was great fodder for his paranoid </v>

86
00:04:24.991 --> 00:04:25.824
<v Speaker 1>cyberpunk spy fiction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so in metal gear solid to our villains </v>

87
00:04:28.681 --> 00:04:29.514
<v Speaker 1>are the patriots,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a secret network of conspirators who </v>

88
00:04:31.741 --> 00:04:35.400
<v Speaker 1>have a chokehold on the US government,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the media and the minds of the people.</v>

89
00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:38.600
<v Speaker 3>This country is shaped and controlled as</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Patriot seat fit.</v>

90
00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:40.760
<v Speaker 3>The people are shown what they want to </v>
<v Speaker 3>believe,</v>

91
00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:41.863
<v Speaker 3>what you call it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Government is actually a weld stage </v>

92
00:04:43.311 --> 00:04:45.890
<v Speaker 3>production aimed at satisfying the </v>
<v Speaker 3>public,</v>

93
00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:47.950
<v Speaker 1>which includes you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the player</v>

94
00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:48.903
<v Speaker 4>colonel.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just remembered something that I've </v>

95
00:04:52.031 --> 00:04:54.880
<v Speaker 4>never met you in person,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not once.</v>

96
00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:58.580
<v Speaker 1>If you fell for all the bait and switch </v>
<v Speaker 1>tricks packed into games writing now,</v>

97
00:04:58.581 --> 00:04:59.720
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the sql games,</v>

98
00:04:59.721 --> 00:05:00.554
<v Speaker 1>it's revealed that the patriots are </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually robot ai satellites made for </v>

99
00:05:03.141 --> 00:05:05.060
<v Speaker 1>comic relief sidekicks from the Prequel </v>
<v Speaker 1>Games,</v>

100
00:05:05.061 --> 00:05:08.690
<v Speaker 1>but importantly they're based on </v>
<v Speaker 1>something much more real.</v>

101
00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:09.613
<v Speaker 1>We are formless.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We are very disciplined and morality </v>

102
00:05:13.011 --> 00:05:13.844
<v Speaker 1>that Americans invoke so often.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Patriots are the concept of memes </v>

103
00:05:17.271 --> 00:05:18.104
<v Speaker 1>personified.</v>

104
00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:19.163
<v Speaker 3>We started with genetic engineering and </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the end we succeeded in digitizing </v>

105
00:05:23.561 --> 00:05:25.420
<v Speaker 3>life itself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there are</v>

106
00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:27.700
<v Speaker 1>are things not covered by genetic </v>
<v Speaker 1>information.</v>

107
00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:32.890
<v Speaker 1>What do you mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Human Memories ID culture,</v>

108
00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:34.330
<v Speaker 1>history,</v>
<v Speaker 1>metal gear,</v>

109
00:05:34.331 --> 00:05:36.370
<v Speaker 1>solid one references Richard Dawkins' </v>
<v Speaker 1>book,</v>

110
00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:37.263
<v Speaker 1>the selfish gene in which he coined the </v>
<v Speaker 1>term the beams means our cultural ideas </v>

111
00:05:40.931 --> 00:05:45.490
<v Speaker 1>that replicate and spread from people to</v>
<v Speaker 1>people similar to gene's tunes,</v>

112
00:05:45.491 --> 00:05:49.750
<v Speaker 1>catchphrases and ideas are all means </v>
<v Speaker 1>also means or means,</v>

113
00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:51.850
<v Speaker 1>so as the language you're thinking in </v>
<v Speaker 1>right now,</v>

114
00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:54.310
<v Speaker 1>which means the perspective that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand reality,</v>

115
00:05:54.311 --> 00:05:55.144
<v Speaker 1>which is all made out of meat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The are these psychological </v>

116
00:05:58.491 --> 00:06:01.880
<v Speaker 1>homogenization of culture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They aren't globalization,</v>

<v Speaker 1>they or why other countries are wearing </v>
<v Speaker 1>America's blue jeans and listening to </v>

118
00:06:05.421 --> 00:06:07.310
<v Speaker 1>their poppies,</v>

00:06:07.311 --> 00:06:08.144
<v Speaker 1>They are yet Japanese game developer can</v>
<v Speaker 1>succeed at making very Japanese games </v>

120
00:06:11.751 --> 00:06:14.360
<v Speaker 1>for Americans based on American action </v>
<v Speaker 1>movies.</v>

121
00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:19.040
<v Speaker 1>All the movie references that Cocina </v>
<v Speaker 1>included in these games are memes as the</v>

122
00:06:19.041 --> 00:06:19.874
<v Speaker 1>games themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the end of metal gear solid to has all </v>

123
00:06:22.071 --> 00:06:22.904
<v Speaker 1>the characters reflecting on the meaning</v>
<v Speaker 1>of life and it's said to reflect co </v>

124
00:06:27.191 --> 00:06:29.510
<v Speaker 1>Gina's anxieties about his own work as </v>
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>

125
00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:32.640
<v Speaker 5>Life isn't just about passing on your </v>
<v Speaker 5>genes.</v>

126
00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:38.930
<v Speaker 5>We can leave behind much more than just </v>
<v Speaker 5>DNA through speech and music,</v>

127
00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:44.970
<v Speaker 5>literature and movies.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What we've seen heard,</v>

128
00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:48.990
<v Speaker 5>felt anger,</v>
<v Speaker 5>joy and sorrow.</v>

129
00:06:51.390 --> 00:06:53.190
<v Speaker 5>These are the things I will pass on.</v>

130
00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:56.130
<v Speaker 1>Countless interviews at the time </v>
<v Speaker 1>revealed that metal gear,</v>

131
00:06:56.131 --> 00:06:59.910
<v Speaker 1>solid tube was supposed to be coaching </v>
<v Speaker 1>was last metal gear games before handing</v>

132
00:06:59.911 --> 00:07:03.540
<v Speaker 1>it off to a new team.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In a sense go Jima was trying to pass on</v>

133
00:07:03.541 --> 00:07:04.374
<v Speaker 1>his mean,</v>

134
00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:09.700
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well listen,</v>

135
00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:14.920
<v Speaker 5>what I do,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to quit,</v>

136
00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:18.590
<v Speaker 1>but was so unsatisfied with what they </v>
<v Speaker 1>were cooking up for.</v>

137
00:07:18.591 --> 00:07:22.520
<v Speaker 1>Mail gear solid three that he decided to</v>
<v Speaker 1>step back in and directed himself.</v>

138
00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:23.593
<v Speaker 1>So in true [inaudible] fashion metal </v>
<v Speaker 1>gear solid three is full of even more </v>

139
00:07:27.141 --> 00:07:30.320
<v Speaker 1>Kajima means the game takes place on </v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] first birthday,</v>

140
00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:31.490
<v Speaker 1>August 24th,</v>
<v Speaker 1>19,</v>

141
00:07:31.491 --> 00:07:34.100
<v Speaker 1>64,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and includes multiple movie references,</v>

142
00:07:34.190 --> 00:07:37.250
<v Speaker 1>especially early sixties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>James Bond and hitchcock flicks.</v>

143
00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:40.340
<v Speaker 1>Go was personal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Philosophies are once again present,</v>

144
00:07:40.341 --> 00:07:44.720
<v Speaker 1>but this time there's a decidedly more </v>
<v Speaker 1>nihilistic slant from a character called</v>

145
00:07:44.721 --> 00:07:45.830
<v Speaker 1>the boss.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Light is,</v>

146
00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:49.520
<v Speaker 1>but a farewell gift from the darkness to</v>
<v Speaker 1>those on their way to die.</v>

147
00:07:49.830 --> 00:07:53.090
<v Speaker 1>The bosses message of breaking down the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world's political barriers</v>

148
00:07:53.170 --> 00:07:56.060
<v Speaker 5>is there such a thing as an absolute </v>
<v Speaker 5>timeless anymore.</v>

149
00:07:57.970 --> 00:08:00.360
<v Speaker 5>There is no such thing and never has </v>
<v Speaker 5>been,</v>

150
00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:05.000
<v Speaker 5>and the reason is that our enemies are </v>
<v Speaker 5>human beings like us.</v>

151
00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:08.760
<v Speaker 5>There can only be our enemies in </v>
<v Speaker 5>relative terms.</v>

152
00:08:12.210 --> 00:08:13.780
<v Speaker 5>The world must be made whole</v>

153
00:08:14.490 --> 00:08:19.050
<v Speaker 1>is gradually warped and perverted until </v>
<v Speaker 1>it turns our hero into a villain.</v>

154
00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:20.153
<v Speaker 1>The big boss of the earlier two d games </v>
<v Speaker 1>who was warmongering for the sake of </v>

155
00:08:23.011 --> 00:08:25.260
<v Speaker 1>giving mercenaries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a purpose in life.</v>

156
00:08:25.410 --> 00:08:28.890
<v Speaker 1>It's a bleak view of the world that </v>
<v Speaker 1>comes to fruition in metal gear.</v>

157
00:08:28.891 --> 00:08:32.270
<v Speaker 1>Solid four ever respect that face in </v>
<v Speaker 1>your mirror.</v>

158
00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:33.553
<v Speaker 1>The first world becomes obsessed with </v>
<v Speaker 1>war and the third world is their </v>

159
00:08:36.631 --> 00:08:38.520
<v Speaker 1>battlefield.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In the Games universe,</v>

160
00:08:38.580 --> 00:08:42.120
<v Speaker 1>wars had become cold financial </v>
<v Speaker 1>strategies in real life,</v>

161
00:08:42.121 --> 00:08:44.280
<v Speaker 1>so had metal gear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>solid games under Konami.</v>

162
00:08:44.700 --> 00:08:45.533
<v Speaker 1>This was the second time code.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jima was roped into continuing metal </v>

163
00:08:48.061 --> 00:08:51.920
<v Speaker 1>gear solid after wanting to back out </v>
<v Speaker 1>with attempts at franchises like zone of</v>

164
00:08:51.921 --> 00:08:52.754
<v Speaker 1>the vendors and Bach tie failing to </v>
<v Speaker 1>capture mainstream attention the same </v>

165
00:08:55.561 --> 00:08:56.394
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So metal gear solid four was explicitly </v>

166
00:08:58.801 --> 00:09:01.320
<v Speaker 1>designed to end it all for real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This time,</v>

167
00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:02.333
<v Speaker 1>the gameplay acquiesced to the first </v>
<v Speaker 1>person shooter modes and fully </v>

168
00:09:04.471 --> 00:09:05.304
<v Speaker 1>controllable cameras demanded by </v>
<v Speaker 1>reviewers and the story gave in to the </v>

169
00:09:07.891 --> 00:09:11.310
<v Speaker 1>fans most burning questions while the </v>
<v Speaker 1>cutscenes fulfilled comas,</v>

170
00:09:11.430 --> 00:09:14.790
<v Speaker 1>lifelong desire to make films,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no other metal gear,</v>

171
00:09:14.970 --> 00:09:15.803
<v Speaker 1>maybe even no other game has cut scenes </v>
<v Speaker 1>that go on as long as the and the grand </v>

172
00:09:20.010 --> 00:09:23.070
<v Speaker 1>irony of it all is that this is both be </v>
<v Speaker 1>closest and furthest.</v>

173
00:09:23.070 --> 00:09:25.950
<v Speaker 1>Kajima came to making actual movies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Metal gear,</v>

174
00:09:25.951 --> 00:09:29.060
<v Speaker 1>solid four had plenty of live action </v>
<v Speaker 1>video put Kajima,</v>

175
00:09:29.100 --> 00:09:29.933
<v Speaker 1>didn't direct write or produce it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These intro commercials were outsourced </v>

176
00:09:33.211 --> 00:09:35.100
<v Speaker 1>to an American studio.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile,</v>

177
00:09:35.101 --> 00:09:35.934
<v Speaker 1>questions from metal gear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>solid food that were never meant to be </v>

178
00:09:37.651 --> 00:09:40.500
<v Speaker 1>answered are answered to the Wilderness </v>
<v Speaker 1>and results</v>

179
00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:43.720
<v Speaker 5>on site.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Destroy Katie with a nuclear strike.</v>

180
00:09:44.130 --> 00:09:49.130
<v Speaker 5>The Patriots network will be mine and </v>
<v Speaker 5>then I'll build my haven.</v>

181
00:09:50.580 --> 00:09:51.413
<v Speaker 1>A melodramatic costume party.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Story ends with the hero and villain </v>

182
00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:54.833
<v Speaker 1>beating the dead horse of their conflict</v>
<v Speaker 1>for 20 minutes and solid snake is now </v>

183
00:09:58.650 --> 00:09:59.483
<v Speaker 1>old snake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's definitely an undercurrent of </v>

184
00:10:01.321 --> 00:10:02.154
<v Speaker 1>self hatred running through this game,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially with the knowledge that Koji </v>

185
00:10:04.531 --> 00:10:05.364
<v Speaker 1>human wanted to run away from its </v>
<v Speaker 1>development and originally planned in </v>

186
00:10:07.621 --> 00:10:08.454
<v Speaker 1>ending where were arrested and executed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which came from the fact that fans sent </v>

187
00:10:11.671 --> 00:10:16.050
<v Speaker 1>him death threats if it wasn't made,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but despite could was protests and metal</v>

188
00:10:16.051 --> 00:10:19.320
<v Speaker 1>gear solid four is conclusive narrative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He still couldn't get out.</v>

189
00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:20.393
<v Speaker 1>Konami was demanding more and more of </v>
<v Speaker 1>these games and they were to be made by </v>

190
00:10:23.461 --> 00:10:24.294
<v Speaker 1>no one else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A rocky relationship between Kajima and </v>

191
00:10:26.971 --> 00:10:27.804
<v Speaker 1>his employer started boiling up in 2009 </v>
<v Speaker 1>with him joking in an interview that if </v>

192
00:10:31.531 --> 00:10:32.364
<v Speaker 1>fans Richard Right the CEO of Konami and</v>
<v Speaker 1>tell him that [inaudible] doesn't have </v>

193
00:10:35.161 --> 00:10:38.040
<v Speaker 1>to make metal gear anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it might be easier for him to stop.</v>

194
00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:39.313
<v Speaker 1>Go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jean was only nonmetal gear project </v>

195
00:10:40.561 --> 00:10:44.400
<v Speaker 1>after four was a minor production role </v>
<v Speaker 1>in Castlevania lords of shadow,</v>

196
00:10:44.520 --> 00:10:47.340
<v Speaker 1>but then it was right back to snake and </v>
<v Speaker 1>now metal.</v>

197
00:10:47.341 --> 00:10:48.174
<v Speaker 1>Here's plot had to become more </v>
<v Speaker 1>convoluted and provocative to keep up </v>

198
00:10:50.611 --> 00:10:51.690
<v Speaker 1>with its own standard.</v>

199
00:10:52.740 --> 00:10:55.380
<v Speaker 5>Obviously they're bringing in state of </v>
<v Speaker 5>the art,</v>

200
00:10:55.381 --> 00:11:00.270
<v Speaker 5>weaponry and equipment by the shipload.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Where'd they get that kind of cash?</v>

201
00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:06.080
<v Speaker 5>I fear maybe involved the CIA.</v>

202
00:11:07.410 --> 00:11:10.830
<v Speaker 1>Peace walkers fiction tested the idea of</v>
<v Speaker 1>nuclear deterrence.</v>

203
00:11:11.070 --> 00:11:12.840
<v Speaker 1>Wait,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's launching a new.</v>

204
00:11:12.900 --> 00:11:14.910
<v Speaker 1>To prove that is perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Current works.</v>

205
00:11:15.490 --> 00:11:18.750
<v Speaker 1>His words to prove that if someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>attacks us,</v>

206
00:11:19.230 --> 00:11:20.063
<v Speaker 1>we will strike back a situation that </v>
<v Speaker 1>mirrored the mutually assured </v>

207
00:11:23.251 --> 00:11:24.084
<v Speaker 1>destruction of coaching was creative </v>
<v Speaker 1>work against Konami's tight control of </v>

208
00:11:27.211 --> 00:11:29.910
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This t rated portable entry still had to</v>

209
00:11:29.911 --> 00:11:30.744
<v Speaker 1>explore the gritty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He'll turn of big boss and the route </v>

210
00:11:32.881 --> 00:11:36.090
<v Speaker 1>code human took was her boss to idolize </v>
<v Speaker 1>Che Guevara.</v>

211
00:11:36.210 --> 00:11:37.043
<v Speaker 6>Jay never managed to numb himself pain.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's why people loved him and why he </v>

212
00:11:42.981 --> 00:11:43.750
<v Speaker 6>died.</v>

213
00:11:43.750 --> 00:11:48.530
<v Speaker 1>A figure whose popularity to his western</v>
<v Speaker 1>audience is polarizing to say the least.</v>

214
00:11:48.980 --> 00:11:49.813
<v Speaker 1>Four years later,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Anti American sentiments of the </v>

217
00:12:00.521 --> 00:12:04.270
<v Speaker 1>horrific sexual humiliation and torture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A year after that,</v>

218
00:12:04.300 --> 00:12:05.133
<v Speaker 1>metal gear solid five,</v>

226
00:12:33.590 --> 00:12:35.480
<v Speaker 1>Would you ever read about Napster in </v>
<v Speaker 1>ninth,</v>

227
00:12:35.490 --> 00:12:36.323
<v Speaker 1>99 to make the Patriots and it's just as</v>

00:12:39.621 --> 00:12:43.940
<v Speaker 1>Grip Guantanamo and Edward Snowden </v>

229
00:12:43.941 --> 00:12:44.774
<v Speaker 1>illuminati cipher.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These stories were being told in spite </v>

00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:50.960
<v Speaker 1>of and perhaps in response to coach </v>
<v Speaker 1>edema,</v>

231
00:12:51.050 --> 00:12:51.883
<v Speaker 1>not exactly having a great working </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship with neo liberal corporate </v>

232
00:12:55.101 --> 00:12:55.934
<v Speaker 1>capitalism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When rumors of a rivalry between Cocina </v>

233
00:12:58.130 --> 00:12:58.963
<v Speaker 1>and Konami came to light,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so did stories of his bosses actively </v>

234
00:13:01.821 --> 00:13:02.654
<v Speaker 1>sabotaging his projects.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eventually shipping metal gear solid </v>

235
00:13:04.971 --> 00:13:07.280
<v Speaker 1>five in two parts with an incomplete </v>
<v Speaker 1>ending,</v>

236
00:13:07.650 --> 00:13:10.130
<v Speaker 1>believe it or not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first edition of Moby Dick,</v>

237
00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:10.993
<v Speaker 1>a novel frequently referenced,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and metal gear solid five was also </v>

238
00:13:13.701 --> 00:13:14.534
<v Speaker 1>released without it's ending chapter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The parallels between moby Dick and </v>

239
00:13:17.451 --> 00:13:18.284
<v Speaker 1>metal gear solid five are rampant venom </v>
<v Speaker 1>code named Ahab is an amputee naval </v>

240
00:13:26.451 --> 00:13:27.284
<v Speaker 1>captain hell bent on revenge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who commands a vessel called the peak </v>

241
00:13:29.590 --> 00:13:31.550
<v Speaker 1>was just like the Aa happened in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>book,</v>

242
00:13:35.110 --> 00:13:35.350
<v Speaker 7>but</v>

243
00:13:35.350 --> 00:13:36.183
<v Speaker 1>this connection to the male of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>classic is also reflected by the </v>

244
00:13:38.171 --> 00:13:39.004
<v Speaker 1>players' response to the game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like Ahab the player is relentlessly </v>

245
00:13:42.431 --> 00:13:43.264
<v Speaker 1>chasing after a white whale.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'll never best a feeling of </v>

246
00:13:45.911 --> 00:13:48.340
<v Speaker 1>completeness at the end of finishing </v>
<v Speaker 1>this game.</v>

247
00:13:48.670 --> 00:13:49.503
<v Speaker 1>It's a feeling so pervasive that entire </v>
<v Speaker 1>fan communities have sprung up over </v>

248
00:13:53.201 --> 00:13:55.300
<v Speaker 1>refusing to believe that the game is </v>
<v Speaker 1>over.</v>

249
00:13:55.600 --> 00:13:57.220
<v Speaker 1>Similarly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Melville's book,</v>

250
00:13:57.221 --> 00:13:58.054
<v Speaker 1>the eponymous white whale is seen as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>representation of being a hollowness of </v>

251
00:14:01.301 --> 00:14:02.134
<v Speaker 1>the universe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the thought of annihilation or the </v>

252
00:14:04.061 --> 00:14:07.960
<v Speaker 1>meaningless prize of a life spent </v>
<v Speaker 1>seeking meaning in metal gear.</v>

253
00:14:07.961 --> 00:14:12.370
<v Speaker 1>Solid five players can seek meaning by </v>
<v Speaker 1>completing a story arc that ends halfway</v>

254
00:14:12.371 --> 00:14:15.040
<v Speaker 1>through with the second half of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>story asking,</v>

255
00:14:15.070 --> 00:14:15.903
<v Speaker 1>but never answering the question of what</v>
<v Speaker 1>happens after a hero defeats the </v>

256
00:14:18.911 --> 00:14:19.744
<v Speaker 1>villain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Players can instead seek meaning in the </v>

257
00:14:21.281 --> 00:14:22.114
<v Speaker 1>Games multiplayer missions which </v>
<v Speaker 1>developed a kind of whaling economy of </v>

258
00:14:24.941 --> 00:14:28.330
<v Speaker 1>their own or they can find meaning by </v>
<v Speaker 1>going for a completion score.</v>

259
00:14:28.350 --> 00:14:32.080
<v Speaker 1>That of course has them fruitlessly </v>
<v Speaker 1>chasing after rare animals,</v>

260
00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:33.273
<v Speaker 1>but no matter how you play,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no matter which ending you go for the </v>

261
00:14:36.281 --> 00:14:38.350
<v Speaker 1>Games,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tone remains melancholy,</v>

262
00:14:38.410 --> 00:14:40.370
<v Speaker 1>lonely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and a anti climactic.</v>

263
00:14:40.700 --> 00:14:41.533
<v Speaker 1>There's no epic final boss fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Each ending is intended to leave the </v>

264
00:14:44.681 --> 00:14:45.514
<v Speaker 1>player feeling unfulfilled and wanting </v>
<v Speaker 1>the player feels a literal phantom pain </v>

265
00:14:50.140 --> 00:14:50.973
<v Speaker 1>which leads us in our own opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least to believe that could Jima was </v>

266
00:14:54.020 --> 00:14:54.853
<v Speaker 1>his own,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Captain Ahab with his own obsession to </v>

267
00:14:57.231 --> 00:14:58.064
<v Speaker 1>defy the typically cold corporate </v>
<v Speaker 1>tradition of game design and create his </v>

268
00:15:01.670 --> 00:15:02.503
<v Speaker 1>own art on his own terms if he's been </v>
<v Speaker 1>wanting to get crazy and make something </v>

269
00:15:06.531 --> 00:15:07.364
<v Speaker 1>different than at least his story can </v>
<v Speaker 1>have a happy ending for now because </v>

270
00:15:10.281 --> 00:15:13.820
<v Speaker 1>Norman reedus waking up naked on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>beach after giving birth to a magic goes</v>

271
00:15:13.821 --> 00:15:18.410
<v Speaker 1>baby is a premise of a story where we </v>
<v Speaker 1>truly don't know what to expect and also</v>

272
00:15:18.411 --> 00:15:21.200
<v Speaker 1>something that could have never been </v>
<v Speaker 1>done under the thumb of Konami.</v>

273
00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:22.393
<v Speaker 1>So is this life imitating art or were </v>
<v Speaker 1>these just insightful predictions bound </v>

274
00:15:25.731 --> 00:15:27.050
<v Speaker 1>to come true?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Either way,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Death stranding.</v>

276
00:15:29.330 --> 00:15:31.700
<v Speaker 1>Kajima is truly one of those </v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting.</v>

<v Speaker 1>the game with fresh eyes,</v>

283
00:15:45.651 --> 00:15:49.160
