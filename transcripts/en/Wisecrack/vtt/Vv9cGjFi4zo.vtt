1
00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:05.480
<v Speaker 1>This video is brought to you by Wix,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of wise crack,</v>

2
00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:09.333
<v Speaker 1>jared again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and today we're talking about the enemy </v>

3
00:00:10.811 --> 00:00:13.140
<v Speaker 1>that isn't sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Humidity has much time.</v>

4
00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:14.153
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're taking a trip back inside the </v>

5
00:00:15.671 --> 00:00:19.180
<v Speaker 1>walls and revisiting attack on Titan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Before we get started though,</v>

6
00:00:19.181 --> 00:00:21.010
<v Speaker 1>a quick shout out to us</v>

7
00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:24.960
<v Speaker 1>and our first meeting you want attack on</v>
<v Speaker 1>Titan.</v>

8
00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:25.853
<v Speaker 1>We piece together all the German </v>
<v Speaker 1>sounding names in the vague political </v>

9
00:00:30.271 --> 00:00:31.104
<v Speaker 1>illusions to say that attack on Titan </v>
<v Speaker 1>was a show about a concept in political </v>

10
00:00:33.781 --> 00:00:36.120
<v Speaker 1>theory called the friend enemy </v>
<v Speaker 1>distinction.</v>

11
00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:37.163
<v Speaker 1>Check that video out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the Tldr is functionally that this </v>

12
00:00:39.541 --> 00:00:42.030
<v Speaker 1>guy named Carl Schmidt said that friends</v>
<v Speaker 1>and enemies,</v>

13
00:00:42.031 --> 00:00:42.864
<v Speaker 1>right foundational division in politics </v>
<v Speaker 1>without which some pretty bad stuff </v>

14
00:00:46.411 --> 00:00:48.710
<v Speaker 1>would happen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we mused.</v>

15
00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:51.300
<v Speaker 1>What if the show is a critique of Carl </v>
<v Speaker 1>Schmitt,</v>

16
00:00:51.301 --> 00:00:55.760
<v Speaker 1>who by the way is not a nice man and got</v>
<v Speaker 1>caught up with some ad stuff.</v>

17
00:00:55.761 --> 00:00:58.530
<v Speaker 1>And the third also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we didn't read the Maga,</v>

18
00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.150
<v Speaker 1>and today that critique habit as attack </v>
<v Speaker 1>on titan is progressed,</v>

19
00:01:03.151 --> 00:01:06.360
<v Speaker 1>it became clear that these stark </v>
<v Speaker 1>division between enemy and friends,</v>

20
00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:10.110
<v Speaker 1>I he tightened and human is a pretty </v>
<v Speaker 1>intense fabrication,</v>

21
00:01:10.111 --> 00:01:12.120
<v Speaker 1>used to advance a specific agenda.</v>

22
00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:13.313
<v Speaker 1>Seasons two and three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>explore what happens when that </v>

23
00:01:14.851 --> 00:01:15.684
<v Speaker 1>distinction begins to crumble to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can we just patch up society and go </v>

24
00:01:26.161 --> 00:01:27.450
<v Speaker 1>home?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

25
00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.660
<v Speaker 1>not quite.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's because as the show explores,</v>

26
00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:31.703
<v Speaker 1>even when the truth is on your side,</v>
<v Speaker 1>society has some great defense </v>

27
00:01:34.531 --> 00:01:39.450
<v Speaker 1>mechanisms to uphold the status quo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So strap on your odm gear and join us as</v>

28
00:01:39.451 --> 00:01:42.030
<v Speaker 1>we go deep on attack on Titan seasons </v>
<v Speaker 1>two and three.</v>

29
00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:43.980
<v Speaker 1>And as always,</v>
<v Speaker 1>spoiled ahead.</v>

30
00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:45.953
<v Speaker 1>First up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to say thank you to our sponsors </v>

31
00:01:47.221 --> 00:01:48.054
<v Speaker 1>over at wix.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wix is the easiest way to create </v>

32
00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.040
<v Speaker 1>beautiful professional websites for </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever your needs may be.</v>

33
00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.920
<v Speaker 1>I'm actually trying to get onto the </v>
<v Speaker 1>professional voiceover game.</v>

34
00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:59.220
<v Speaker 1>So I created a website with wix to </v>
<v Speaker 1>present all my voice samples.</v>

35
00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:00.203
<v Speaker 1>So check it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was creating a website for myself and </v>

36
00:02:02.761 --> 00:02:06.720
<v Speaker 1>I wanted a portfolio and cv and I'm a </v>
<v Speaker 1>total newbie.</v>

37
00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:07.973
<v Speaker 1>Then I literally started typing and </v>
<v Speaker 1>there was already a template for </v>

38
00:02:10.231 --> 00:02:12.660
<v Speaker 1>voiceover artists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I picked a style I liked,</v>

39
00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:16.350
<v Speaker 1>and within minutes I was dragging and </v>
<v Speaker 1>dropping my audio files and Bam.</v>

40
00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:19.890
<v Speaker 1>Now I have something I'm confident to </v>
<v Speaker 1>send out to potential clients.</v>

41
00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:23.310
<v Speaker 1>Establishing yourself as a professional </v>
<v Speaker 1>in a new space can be daunting,</v>

42
00:02:23.311 --> 00:02:24.144
<v Speaker 1>but I was really surprised by how </v>
<v Speaker 1>inviting and easy it was to create a </v>

43
00:02:26.941 --> 00:02:29.190
<v Speaker 1>website that makes it look like I know </v>
<v Speaker 1>what I'm doing.</v>

44
00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:31.890
<v Speaker 1>So if you're looking to up your game </v>
<v Speaker 1>before 2019,</v>

45
00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:32.843
<v Speaker 1>go to wix.com/wise</v>
<v Speaker 1>crack or click the link in the </v>

46
00:02:34.831 --> 00:02:39.660
<v Speaker 1>description to start making your free </v>
<v Speaker 1>website today and now back to the show.</v>

47
00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:41.153
<v Speaker 1>Let's start with a quick recap.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Attack on Titan is about the last </v>

48
00:02:43.561 --> 00:02:44.394
<v Speaker 1>vestiges of humanity hiding out behind </v>
<v Speaker 1>giant walls to avoid naked man eating </v>

49
00:02:48.331 --> 00:02:51.090
<v Speaker 1>titles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as you might imagine with giant monsters</v>

50
00:02:51.091 --> 00:02:53.520
<v Speaker 1>on the outskirts of your walls are </v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty rational.</v>

51
00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:58.230
<v Speaker 1>US versus them structure society.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a pretty high risk lifestyle and</v>

52
00:02:58.231 --> 00:03:01.150
<v Speaker 1>sure enough titans breakthrough the </v>
<v Speaker 1>outermost wall.</v>

53
00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:02.403
<v Speaker 1>From there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things go from dire to downright </v>

54
00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:09.160
<v Speaker 1>dystopian and it's up to the scouts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mankind's outright or strikeforce to get</v>

55
00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:12.430
<v Speaker 1>under control,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like the city's walls,</v>

56
00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:16.060
<v Speaker 1>the stark division between human and </v>
<v Speaker 1>tightened doesn't last very long.</v>

57
00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:17.613
<v Speaker 1>At the end of season one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the scouts realized that one of their </v>

58
00:03:19.181 --> 00:03:22.160
<v Speaker 1>own Erin can shape shift between human </v>
<v Speaker 1>and tightened.</v>

59
00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:23.463
<v Speaker 1>Also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he might be able to use his tightened </v>

60
00:03:24.401 --> 00:03:26.800
<v Speaker 1>power to seal that Pesky hold on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>outer wall.</v>

61
00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:33.360
<v Speaker 2>Jonesy and custodian pull customer could</v>
<v Speaker 2>come in on Sunday.</v>

62
00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:35.943
<v Speaker 1>In season two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a bunch of titans emerge and trap the </v>

63
00:03:37.751 --> 00:03:38.584
<v Speaker 1>scouts in a castle or fellow scout you </v>
<v Speaker 1>mirror turns into a titan surprise to </v>

64
00:03:42.941 --> 00:03:43.774
<v Speaker 1>rescue them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Apparently everyone is a tightened as </v>

65
00:03:45.971 --> 00:03:46.804
<v Speaker 1>bertold and reiner are in fact be </v>
<v Speaker 1>colossal and armored tightened </v>

66
00:03:50.021 --> 00:03:51.970
<v Speaker 1>respectively.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They kidnapped Aaron,</v>

67
00:03:51.971 --> 00:03:52.804
<v Speaker 1>but the scouts are able to rescue him </v>
<v Speaker 1>and start laying out their plan to fix </v>

68
00:03:55.601 --> 00:03:56.434
<v Speaker 1>the wall.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Aaron learns he can control nearby </v>

69
00:03:58.211 --> 00:04:02.710
<v Speaker 1>titans and we learned that this lady,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Krista is actually named Historia,</v>

70
00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:06.810
<v Speaker 1>which is very important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then season three happens.</v>

71
00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:07.983
<v Speaker 1>Irwin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the commander of the scouts stages a </v>

72
00:04:09.091 --> 00:04:11.700
<v Speaker 1>Kuda to top by turning the people </v>
<v Speaker 1>against the nobles.</v>

73
00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:12.833
<v Speaker 1>Scouts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Aaron and Historia are kidnapped by his </v>

74
00:04:14.281 --> 00:04:15.210
<v Speaker 1>story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his father,</v>

75
00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:17.850
<v Speaker 1>the true king broad rice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They escape,</v>

76
00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:20.850
<v Speaker 1>but not before rod rice becomes the </v>
<v Speaker 1>grossest tightened.</v>

77
00:04:20.851 --> 00:04:24.450
<v Speaker 1>To date he attacks the city,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but Aaron and Historia kill him.</v>

78
00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:28.590
<v Speaker 1>Cementing Historia as a warrior queen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the people can get behind.</v>

79
00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:29.783
<v Speaker 1>Finally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>united that people can get back to </v>

80
00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:34.440
<v Speaker 1>retaking the outer wall.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

81
00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:36.930
<v Speaker 1>now we're all caught up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what do we make of all that?</v>

82
00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:38.340
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as we mentioned,</v>

83
00:04:38.341 --> 00:04:39.174
<v Speaker 1>attack on Titan has always been about </v>
<v Speaker 1>the distinction of being a friend and </v>

84
00:04:41.461 --> 00:04:42.294
<v Speaker 1>enemy and regular speak.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the idea that the easiest way to </v>

85
00:04:44.401 --> 00:04:48.090
<v Speaker 1>get society to work together is if </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're against someone else.</v>

86
00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:51.600
<v Speaker 1>I'll season one showed a whole society </v>
<v Speaker 1>built around this principle.</v>

87
00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:52.583
<v Speaker 1>Seasons two and three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>explore how people empower knowingly </v>

88
00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:57.780
<v Speaker 1>manufacturer this false divide.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As such,</v>

89
00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:00.810
<v Speaker 1>attack on Titan is a show about the flow</v>
<v Speaker 1>of information.</v>

90
00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:05.160
<v Speaker 1>Each episode includes an interstitial </v>
<v Speaker 1>labeled information available for public</v>

91
00:05:05.161 --> 00:05:08.460
<v Speaker 1>disclosure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which implies a trove of information not</v>

92
00:05:08.461 --> 00:05:09.294
<v Speaker 1>available to the public.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some of that classified information </v>

93
00:05:11.341 --> 00:05:14.040
<v Speaker 1>includes the titan inside the wall,</v>
<v Speaker 1>brother Nick,</v>

94
00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:16.530
<v Speaker 1>a priest of the wall might know </v>
<v Speaker 1>something about it,</v>

95
00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:20.250
<v Speaker 1>but he gets got by the interior police </v>
<v Speaker 1>before we can say too much,</v>

96
00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:21.383
<v Speaker 1>and when a young Irwin talks about some </v>
<v Speaker 1>of his father's theories on history in </v>

97
00:05:24.091 --> 00:05:24.924
<v Speaker 1>public,</v>
<v Speaker 1>while let's just say that no one has to </v>

98
00:05:26.371 --> 00:05:28.020
<v Speaker 1>worry about waking daddy anymore.</v>

99
00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:29.363
<v Speaker 1>Another critical secret is the fact that</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of these psycho killer titans are </v>

100
00:05:32.341 --> 00:05:36.600
<v Speaker 1>in fact just shape shifting people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Erin is the first example we meet,</v>

101
00:05:36.601 --> 00:05:37.434
<v Speaker 1>but at the end of season one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we see any shape shift and in season </v>

102
00:05:39.991 --> 00:05:40.824
<v Speaker 1>two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yummier Reiner and bertold all </v>

103
00:05:42.421 --> 00:05:43.254
<v Speaker 1>transform.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We even see a town where most of the </v>

104
00:05:45.001 --> 00:05:49.220
<v Speaker 1>population has changed into titans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Diego,</v>

105
00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:54.420
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a critical secret and one,</v>

106
00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:57.120
<v Speaker 1>the nobles will do anything to keep </v>
<v Speaker 1>under wraps.</v>

107
00:05:57.350 --> 00:05:59.990
<v Speaker 1>That's just the tip of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>conspiratorial iceberg.</v>

108
00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:02.360
<v Speaker 1>Behind the already repressive </v>
<v Speaker 1>government.</v>

109
00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:05.990
<v Speaker 1>There's an even more autocratic system </v>
<v Speaker 1>that exists in the shadows.</v>

110
00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:10.160
<v Speaker 1>It turns out that the king we thought </v>
<v Speaker 1>was in charge is just a figurehead.</v>

111
00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:11.233
<v Speaker 1>Instead,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the city is ruled by the rice family </v>

112
00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:13.963
<v Speaker 1>currently rod and his Air Storia who </v>
<v Speaker 1>have the royal blood necessary to </v>

113
00:06:17.511 --> 00:06:21.490
<v Speaker 1>control the powers of the founding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tighten these two,</v>

114
00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:24.540
<v Speaker 1>these Jewish goodwill tonight to shin.</v>

115
00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:29.600
<v Speaker 1>The huc sudden powers like changing the </v>
<v Speaker 1>memory of the citizens and even creating</v>

116
00:06:29.601 --> 00:06:33.130
<v Speaker 1>the walls at old sun juvenile.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No chicana down.</v>

117
00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:34.393
<v Speaker 1>All of that is happening behind the </v>
<v Speaker 1>scenes determining the fate of the </v>

118
00:06:36.771 --> 00:06:37.604
<v Speaker 1>people who have no idea it even exists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The nobles go to great lengths to keep </v>

119
00:06:42.021 --> 00:06:42.854
<v Speaker 1>the secret government secret.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This includes orchestrating a series of </v>

120
00:06:45.951 --> 00:06:48.260
<v Speaker 1>attacks with the dual goals of </v>
<v Speaker 1>kidnapping,</v>

121
00:06:48.261 --> 00:06:49.094
<v Speaker 1>Aaron and Historia for the sake of broad</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rice's plan and framing the scouts for </v>

122
00:06:52.431 --> 00:06:54.890
<v Speaker 1>acting against humanities interests.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'll go,</v>

123
00:06:54.891 --> 00:06:55.641
<v Speaker 1>go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go,</v>

124
00:06:55.641 --> 00:06:56.900
<v Speaker 1>go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and now you're calling.</v>

125
00:06:56.920 --> 00:06:59.320
<v Speaker 1>Let me then Joseph Heron on the auto.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cool.</v>

126
00:06:59.850 --> 00:07:03.230
<v Speaker 1>Why frame the scouts?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because between seeing several different</v>

127
00:07:03.231 --> 00:07:04.064
<v Speaker 1>people turn into titans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they realize that the founding myth of </v>

128
00:07:06.471 --> 00:07:09.380
<v Speaker 1>their society,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that titans are unthinking people.</v>

129
00:07:09.381 --> 00:07:10.214
<v Speaker 1>Eaters is in fact a lie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nor does anyone bothered to mention the </v>

130
00:07:18.171 --> 00:07:22.160
<v Speaker 1>role titans played in constructing the </v>
<v Speaker 1>walls that defined the world for most of</v>

131
00:07:22.161 --> 00:07:22.994
<v Speaker 1>humanity.</v>

132
00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:27.593
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>almost every choice the show makes is </v>

133
00:07:29.931 --> 00:07:33.060
<v Speaker 1>premised on the withholding or discovery</v>
<v Speaker 1>of information,</v>

134
00:07:33.510 --> 00:07:36.970
<v Speaker 1>Vanilla data that Ada,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ada will,</v>

135
00:07:37.140 --> 00:07:40.520
<v Speaker 1>and I have a dovetail Shinju.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That idea is so central to the show.</v>

136
00:07:40.521 --> 00:07:42.530
<v Speaker 1>It's embedded into the narrative </v>
<v Speaker 1>structure.</v>

137
00:07:42.890 --> 00:07:46.400
<v Speaker 1>Attack on Titan is a mystery box show </v>
<v Speaker 1>where the primary driving force,</v>

138
00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:47.273
<v Speaker 1>the narrative is moving from one secret </v>
<v Speaker 1>to the next rather than moving along </v>

139
00:07:50.661 --> 00:07:52.790
<v Speaker 1>narrative arcs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a difficult balance,</v>

140
00:07:52.791 --> 00:07:56.630
<v Speaker 1>but so far the show has pulled it off by</v>
<v Speaker 1>putting the audience in the scouts shoes</v>

141
00:07:56.840 --> 00:08:00.530
<v Speaker 1>just as Aaron and Co have to decide who </v>
<v Speaker 1>to trust and what to believe.</v>

142
00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:02.510
<v Speaker 1>So do we.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As we watch,</v>

143
00:08:02.690 --> 00:08:04.670
<v Speaker 1>the more we learn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more we understand,</v>

144
00:08:04.671 --> 00:08:08.120
<v Speaker 1>but the more questions we have and same </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the scouts,</v>

145
00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:11.180
<v Speaker 1>but this doesn't mean people are kept </v>
<v Speaker 1>totally in the dark.</v>

146
00:08:11.540 --> 00:08:12.373
<v Speaker 1>Rather the information people do get is </v>
<v Speaker 1>designed to lead them to conclusions </v>

147
00:08:15.770 --> 00:08:20.770
<v Speaker 1>that support the system as is key to </v>
<v Speaker 1>that end.</v>

148
00:08:21.111 --> 00:08:24.290
<v Speaker 1>There is a newspaper that provides </v>
<v Speaker 1>information to the population.</v>

149
00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:29.050
<v Speaker 1>Unfortunately the only report what the </v>
<v Speaker 1>interior police tell them they should to</v>

150
00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:29.913
<v Speaker 1>old companion.</v>

151
00:08:32.450 --> 00:08:33.283
<v Speaker 1>This process of giving people enough </v>
<v Speaker 1>information that they don't bother to </v>

152
00:08:36.081 --> 00:08:36.914
<v Speaker 1>question the structure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>providing it or the world they live in </v>

153
00:08:39.230 --> 00:08:44.230
<v Speaker 1>is described by scholar Hamid Dabashi as</v>
<v Speaker 1>epistemic and docmosis were older models</v>

154
00:08:44.631 --> 00:08:45.464
<v Speaker 1>of government,</v>
<v Speaker 1>assumed the lower classes were </v>

155
00:08:46.671 --> 00:08:47.750
<v Speaker 1>unthinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>illiterate,</v>

156
00:08:47.751 --> 00:08:50.060
<v Speaker 1>idiots who wouldn't even know what to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the truth.</v>

157
00:08:50.420 --> 00:08:51.253
<v Speaker 1>Dabashi argues that power can be </v>
<v Speaker 1>solidified by providing bad information </v>

158
00:08:54.530 --> 00:08:56.790
<v Speaker 1>to the thinking and literate people with</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world,</v>

159
00:08:57.090 --> 00:08:59.070
<v Speaker 1>the boss.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She explains that this is information to</v>

160
00:08:59.071 --> 00:09:02.100
<v Speaker 1>consume,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not questioned for the more.</v>

161
00:09:02.101 --> 00:09:04.860
<v Speaker 1>It's not meant to generate a coherent </v>
<v Speaker 1>body of knowledge,</v>

162
00:09:04.861 --> 00:09:05.694
<v Speaker 1>but is instead single serving meant to </v>
<v Speaker 1>induce action for a specific event and </v>

163
00:09:10.651 --> 00:09:11.484
<v Speaker 1>attack on Titan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We see this in the form of state </v>

164
00:09:13.081 --> 00:09:16.830
<v Speaker 1>propaganda and city newspapers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They give people enough information that</v>

165
00:09:16.831 --> 00:09:21.090
<v Speaker 1>they feel like they're making decisions </v>
<v Speaker 1>when instead they're being manipulated.</v>

166
00:09:21.660 --> 00:09:23.040
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>while in the real world,</v>

167
00:09:23.041 --> 00:09:23.874
<v Speaker 1>this kind of epistemic in Moses </v>
<v Speaker 1>generates new knowledge on demand for </v>

168
00:09:27.271 --> 00:09:30.180
<v Speaker 1>whatever benefits those in power want on</v>
<v Speaker 1>a given day.</v>

169
00:09:30.530 --> 00:09:31.363
<v Speaker 1>It has a pretty singular purpose and </v>
<v Speaker 1>attack on Titan to maintain the myth of </v>

170
00:09:34.951 --> 00:09:35.784
<v Speaker 1>the Titan as outsider monster.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That story enables those in power to </v>

171
00:09:39.241 --> 00:09:40.074
<v Speaker 1>justify almost any action in the name of</v>
<v Speaker 1>defending the people from the monsters </v>

172
00:09:43.321 --> 00:09:46.200
<v Speaker 1>outside the walls,</v>
<v Speaker 1>actions like rationing food,</v>

173
00:09:46.380 --> 00:09:49.190
<v Speaker 1>limiting people's movements in a mule </v>
<v Speaker 1>non pod,</v>

174
00:09:49.230 --> 00:09:52.500
<v Speaker 1>more you get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and even attempting to execute Irwin who</v>

175
00:09:52.510 --> 00:09:53.343
<v Speaker 1>was a goddamn hero,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but why lie about the titans in the </v>

176
00:09:56.371 --> 00:09:57.810
<v Speaker 1>first place?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

177
00:09:57.811 --> 00:10:01.650
<v Speaker 1>it varies from character to character,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there are two main reasons,</v>

178
00:10:01.890 --> 00:10:04.560
<v Speaker 1>power and belief,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as for power.</v>

179
00:10:04.620 --> 00:10:05.453
<v Speaker 1>The city with a three wall designed to </v>
<v Speaker 1>protect against Titan attacks also </v>

180
00:10:08.641 --> 00:10:12.120
<v Speaker 1>happens to be based on a strict class </v>
<v Speaker 1>structure that enables the nobles,</v>

181
00:10:12.210 --> 00:10:13.043
<v Speaker 1>cushy lifestyle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They worked to perpetuate a stratified </v>

182
00:10:15.841 --> 00:10:16.674
<v Speaker 1>city suffering for resource shortages </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the occasional naked giant incident </v>

183
00:10:19.530 --> 00:10:23.880
<v Speaker 1>because it's that status quo that keeps </v>
<v Speaker 1>them in mansions and fancy robes.</v>

184
00:10:24.300 --> 00:10:26.940
<v Speaker 1>When Irwin orchestrates a false alarm </v>
<v Speaker 1>about a titan attack,</v>

185
00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:33.870
<v Speaker 1>the nobles don't hesitate to bar </v>
<v Speaker 1>refugees from the inner wall.</v>

186
00:10:34.110 --> 00:10:34.930
<v Speaker 1>Saving notion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't.</v>

187
00:10:34.930 --> 00:10:38.030
<v Speaker 1>No sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>used usage job fuck domino's.</v>

188
00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:42.510
<v Speaker 1>Here's the deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In this moment,</v>

189
00:10:42.540 --> 00:10:43.373
<v Speaker 1>we see that their interest in the system</v>
<v Speaker 1>has nothing to do with protecting the </v>

190
00:10:46.531 --> 00:10:47.364
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all about protecting themselves </v>

191
00:10:52.380 --> 00:10:53.213
<v Speaker 1>without the myths that control society.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Someone might get the thinking that </v>

192
00:10:56.521 --> 00:10:57.354
<v Speaker 1>having a bunch of disconnected,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rich dudes in charge might be a bad </v>

193
00:11:00.151 --> 00:11:01.070
<v Speaker 1>idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nice.</v>

194
00:11:01.170 --> 00:11:02.003
<v Speaker 1>You got stuck out to them with data that</v>
<v Speaker 1>Missoula Udi customers a good nomi </v>

195
00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:06.873
<v Speaker 1>doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The other more complicated reason is </v>

196
00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:10.073
<v Speaker 1>belief.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This idea is most clearly manifested in </v>

197
00:11:11.971 --> 00:11:12.804
<v Speaker 1>the character of rod rice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rice sincerely believes that the only </v>

198
00:11:15.481 --> 00:11:18.960
<v Speaker 1>way to protect the people is to use the </v>
<v Speaker 1>power of the founding titan.</v>

199
00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:24.720
<v Speaker 3>Gluten will come in or she'll take </v>
<v Speaker 3>decent Olga children.</v>

200
00:11:25.040 --> 00:11:30.040
<v Speaker 3>Issue started to sick I Dakota.so</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't sweat it,</v>

201
00:11:32.390 --> 00:11:33.223
<v Speaker 3>Dave,</v>

202
00:11:33.420 --> 00:11:37.050
<v Speaker 1>even if that means wiping people's minds</v>
<v Speaker 1>in having his daughter eat her friend to</v>

203
00:11:37.051 --> 00:11:37.884
<v Speaker 1>become a titan herself of all those </v>
<v Speaker 1>fancy powers court on Tuesday to do </v>

204
00:11:41.630 --> 00:11:45.860
<v Speaker 1>connect to Janina.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The dosing can be production.</v>

205
00:11:45.900 --> 00:11:48.930
<v Speaker 1>That power is so crucial to maintaining </v>
<v Speaker 1>the status quo.</v>

206
00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:52.260
<v Speaker 1>That rice things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no price too high to pay for it,</v>

207
00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:55.570
<v Speaker 1>even his own daughter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thus when she rescues Aaron,</v>

208
00:11:55.720 --> 00:11:58.750
<v Speaker 1>he takes the serum himself to try and </v>
<v Speaker 1>inherit the power,</v>

209
00:11:58.840 --> 00:12:01.480
<v Speaker 1>but it goes awry and he almost kills </v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone.</v>

210
00:12:01.870 --> 00:12:05.590
<v Speaker 1>What makes this dynamic extra </v>
<v Speaker 1>complicated is rod didn't always believe</v>

211
00:12:05.591 --> 00:12:06.424
<v Speaker 1>this as a younger man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he and his brother Yuri wanted to </v>

212
00:12:08.291 --> 00:12:09.124
<v Speaker 1>destroy all the titans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when you're a gained the founding </v>

213
00:12:11.291 --> 00:12:12.124
<v Speaker 1>titans power,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he changed his mind and concluded that </v>

214
00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:17.620
<v Speaker 1>only the city could protect them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no matter the motivation.</v>

215
00:12:17.621 --> 00:12:18.454
<v Speaker 1>The problem with this heifers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Elos way of thinking is that it turns </v>

216
00:12:20.650 --> 00:12:23.560
<v Speaker 1>all political questions into ethical </v>
<v Speaker 1>questions</v>

217
00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:30.240
<v Speaker 4>and you come in with untitled or take </v>
<v Speaker 4>much</v>

218
00:12:36.500 --> 00:12:37.333
<v Speaker 1>for rod rice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether he's trying to destroy all the </v>

219
00:12:38.811 --> 00:12:41.240
<v Speaker 1>titans or maintaining the myth of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Titan.</v>

220
00:12:41.450 --> 00:12:44.930
<v Speaker 1>The stakes are the existence of humanity</v>
<v Speaker 1>theory.</v>

221
00:12:44.950 --> 00:12:45.783
<v Speaker 1>Strong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tall move explains that when politics </v>

222
00:12:47.121 --> 00:12:47.954
<v Speaker 1>become a referendum on ethics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>beat politics part ceases to exist in </v>

223
00:12:52.041 --> 00:12:52.874
<v Speaker 1>favor of a battle between us and them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The process is simple and attack on </v>

224
00:12:56.781 --> 00:12:59.690
<v Speaker 1>Titan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The status quo is set up as the only way</v>

225
00:12:59.691 --> 00:13:00.524
<v Speaker 1>to protect humanity from the titans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That means anyone opposed to the system </v>

226
00:13:04.071 --> 00:13:05.840
<v Speaker 1>represents an existential threat</v>

227
00:13:05.890 --> 00:13:06.723
<v Speaker 4>lighter.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what I wanted that Joseph into </v>

228
00:13:09.970 --> 00:13:10.590
<v Speaker 4>that</v>

229
00:13:10.590 --> 00:13:13.380
<v Speaker 1>and thus they're evil and when it comes </v>
<v Speaker 1>to evil,</v>

230
00:13:13.410 --> 00:13:16.650
<v Speaker 1>there's no reasoning with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The only option is to fight.</v>

231
00:13:17.190 --> 00:13:19.320
<v Speaker 1>For instance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when the city turns on the scouts,</v>

232
00:13:19.470 --> 00:13:23.970
<v Speaker 1>it's because these former heroes put </v>
<v Speaker 1>society in danger by questioning dogma,</v>

233
00:13:24.180 --> 00:13:25.013
<v Speaker 1>so the scouts need to be destroyed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The ultimate existential threats and </v>

234
00:13:29.341 --> 00:13:33.720
<v Speaker 1>ethical enemy according to the fat cats </v>
<v Speaker 1>in this district is the titans.</v>

235
00:13:34.020 --> 00:13:35.940
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we know that's not entirely true.</v>

236
00:13:36.180 --> 00:13:38.670
<v Speaker 1>After the scouts discover Connie's </v>
<v Speaker 1>village to be empty,</v>

237
00:13:38.820 --> 00:13:39.653
<v Speaker 1>they realized that many of the people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're turned into titans including </v>

238
00:13:42.511 --> 00:13:43.344
<v Speaker 1>Connie's mother,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that doesn't matter in the face of </v>

239
00:13:45.631 --> 00:13:46.464
<v Speaker 1>an ethnicized politics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When some people or titans are </v>

240
00:13:49.501 --> 00:13:50.334
<v Speaker 1>determined to be an existential threat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea of understanding them goes out </v>

241
00:13:54.061 --> 00:13:55.350
<v Speaker 1>the window.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Instead,</v>

242
00:13:55.380 --> 00:13:58.650
<v Speaker 1>it's time to grab the swords and sliced </v>
<v Speaker 1>some vital areas.</v>

243
00:13:59.040 --> 00:13:59.873
<v Speaker 1>The titans exist as threats to justify </v>
<v Speaker 1>the status quo and things to destroy as </v>

244
00:14:04.771 --> 00:14:06.540
<v Speaker 1>a gesture towards safety.</v>

245
00:14:06.780 --> 00:14:09.360
<v Speaker 1>That dynamic is maintained by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>control of information,</v>

246
00:14:09.390 --> 00:14:10.223
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that monopoly starts to come apart </v>

247
00:14:12.151 --> 00:14:12.984
<v Speaker 1>on the personal level.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Characters are constantly forced to </v>

248
00:14:15.331 --> 00:14:16.164
<v Speaker 1>choose between promises they made to </v>
<v Speaker 1>friends or themselves and the broader </v>

249
00:14:19.381 --> 00:14:20.214
<v Speaker 1>life fueled social obligations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some characters have no issue rejecting </v>

250
00:14:23.551 --> 00:14:26.820
<v Speaker 1>the morals provided by society in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>name of their own beliefs.</v>

251
00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:27.953
<v Speaker 1>For instance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Historia is unconditionally loyalty </v>

252
00:14:29.870 --> 00:14:30.703
<v Speaker 1>Humira,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though she's a type at the same </v>

253
00:14:32.611 --> 00:14:33.444
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Erin is driven almost entirely by the </v>

254
00:14:35.281 --> 00:14:37.510
<v Speaker 1>hatred of titans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kelsey,</v>

255
00:14:37.560 --> 00:14:39.400
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he standing.</v>

256
00:14:40.230 --> 00:14:41.063
<v Speaker 1>Others are torn between these </v>
<v Speaker 1>obligations constantly like the </v>

257
00:14:43.651 --> 00:14:45.810
<v Speaker 1>tightened serving in the scouts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Birch hold,</v>

258
00:14:45.811 --> 00:14:49.380
<v Speaker 1>Reiner and humira vertical and reiner </v>
<v Speaker 1>loved their fellow soldiers,</v>

259
00:14:49.381 --> 00:14:52.280
<v Speaker 1>but are also bound to their duty as </v>
<v Speaker 1>warriors.</v>

260
00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:53.233
<v Speaker 1>They're willing to capture Aaron,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but at the same time they do end up </v>

261
00:14:55.581 --> 00:14:56.414
<v Speaker 1>letting him go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then they ended up with the beast </v>

262
00:14:58.151 --> 00:15:03.151
<v Speaker 1>heightened setting a trap for Aaron and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the scouse Xhosa tools in the tool.</v>

263
00:15:07.860 --> 00:15:08.171
<v Speaker 1>Cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cool.</v>

264
00:15:08.171 --> 00:15:09.004
<v Speaker 1>Damn up to Dale Scott or Kudos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They are pulled in two directions at </v>

265
00:15:13.451 --> 00:15:15.910
<v Speaker 1>once,</v>
<v Speaker 1>constantly switching between the two.</v>

266
00:15:16.510 --> 00:15:18.590
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing in attack on Titan is simple.</v>

267
00:15:18.591 --> 00:15:22.000
<v Speaker 1>As the show was saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more than sometimes the rules of society</v>

268
00:15:22.060 --> 00:15:26.090
<v Speaker 1>conflict with personal commitment they </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't need.</v>

269
00:15:29.320 --> 00:15:30.153
<v Speaker 1>Instead,</v>
<v Speaker 1>attack on Titan makes it clear that as </v>

270
00:15:31.721 --> 00:15:32.554
<v Speaker 1>the social structure loses legitimacy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether through its failure to protect </v>

271
00:15:35.981 --> 00:15:40.981
<v Speaker 1>the people or it's myths crumbling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>social bonds grow as the scouts discover</v>

272
00:15:41.561 --> 00:15:42.394
<v Speaker 1>the truth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their connection solidify to the point </v>

273
00:15:43.990 --> 00:15:44.823
<v Speaker 1>of trumping their societal obligation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why they go to rescue Aaron and </v>

274
00:15:48.500 --> 00:15:51.160
<v Speaker 1>Historia even as society turns against </v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

275
00:15:51.700 --> 00:15:52.533
<v Speaker 1>Perhaps no other moment illustrates this</v>
<v Speaker 1>point better than Aaron and history is </v>

276
00:15:55.751 --> 00:16:00.370
<v Speaker 1>confrontation in the cave rod rice has </v>
<v Speaker 1>aaron chained up and offers his story of</v>

277
00:16:00.371 --> 00:16:02.470
<v Speaker 1>the tightened serum.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If she takes it,</v>

278
00:16:02.471 --> 00:16:03.304
<v Speaker 1>she will transform,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eat her friend Aaron and become the </v>

279
00:16:05.381 --> 00:16:08.500
<v Speaker 1>founding tightened that rod rice </v>
<v Speaker 1>believes the city needs.</v>

280
00:16:08.860 --> 00:16:11.890
<v Speaker 1>Aaron wants her to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He thinks if she eats him,</v>

281
00:16:11.891 --> 00:16:14.230
<v Speaker 1>she'll be able to not only protect the </v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

282
00:16:14.290 --> 00:16:19.290
<v Speaker 1>but kill the titans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Aaron spouts the city's myths.</v>

283
00:16:21.471 --> 00:16:26.471
<v Speaker 1>Set the story up to convince her </v>
<v Speaker 1>secretary to hostile.</v>

284
00:16:30.190 --> 00:16:31.410
<v Speaker 1>Got Kitchen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's cut.</v>

285
00:16:31.660 --> 00:16:35.450
<v Speaker 1>Pick you talk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but she's not buying it.</v>

286
00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:41.490
<v Speaker 1>She doesn't believe any of the social </v>
<v Speaker 1>myths anymore,</v>

287
00:16:41.640 --> 00:16:44.310
<v Speaker 1>not just because she knows the truth of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the system.</v>

288
00:16:44.510 --> 00:16:47.010
<v Speaker 5>Josie,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you got it,</v>

289
00:16:52.770 --> 00:16:53.603
<v Speaker 1>but she also sees the moral truth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Any social arrangement that puts her in </v>

290
00:16:57.211 --> 00:17:00.840
<v Speaker 1>opposition to her best friend new mirror</v>
<v Speaker 1>is inherently wrong to her.</v>

291
00:17:01.030 --> 00:17:01.863
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Want me to $90 so she rejects rob's </v>

292
00:17:11.691 --> 00:17:14.180
<v Speaker 1>plan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>smashes the vial and freeze.</v>

293
00:17:14.181 --> 00:17:15.014
<v Speaker 1>Aaron.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Aaron is arguing for the status quo </v>

294
00:17:17.661 --> 00:17:21.740
<v Speaker 1>while historian believes in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>possibility of a better different world.</v>

295
00:17:22.190 --> 00:17:26.240
<v Speaker 1>These are the real stakes of personal </v>
<v Speaker 1>obligation versus the ethics provided by</v>

296
00:17:26.241 --> 00:17:27.074
<v Speaker 1>society.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Personal ethics want to protect the </v>

297
00:17:28.761 --> 00:17:33.380
<v Speaker 1>values of the people while social ethics</v>
<v Speaker 1>are designed to sustain the status quo.</v>

298
00:17:33.620 --> 00:17:35.840
<v Speaker 1>Attack on Titan seasons two and three.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Point two.</v>

299
00:17:35.841 --> 00:17:40.841
<v Speaker 1>The dire fact that history can be used </v>
<v Speaker 1>as a tool to tell the story that ends in</v>

300
00:17:41.031 --> 00:17:41.864
<v Speaker 1>the status quo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why it's so important that the </v>

301
00:17:44.031 --> 00:17:44.864
<v Speaker 1>founding titans powers include the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ability to wipe the memory of the </v>

302
00:17:47.691 --> 00:17:51.240
<v Speaker 1>population by creating a history that </v>
<v Speaker 1>fits their needs.</v>

303
00:17:51.330 --> 00:17:52.163
<v Speaker 1>The people in charge are able to </v>
<v Speaker 1>maintain persistent control of the </v>

304
00:17:54.541 --> 00:17:58.950
<v Speaker 1>population and give them ethical </v>
<v Speaker 1>priorities that matched the goals of the</v>

305
00:17:58.951 --> 00:18:03.630
<v Speaker 1>system and attack on Titan society is </v>
<v Speaker 1>sustained by myths.</v>

306
00:18:03.780 --> 00:18:04.613
<v Speaker 1>The powers that be will do anything to </v>
<v Speaker 1>protect those stories and justify the </v>

307
00:18:07.651 --> 00:18:11.760
<v Speaker 1>status quo against the possibility of </v>
<v Speaker 1>any other social model.</v>

308
00:18:11.830 --> 00:18:13.690
<v Speaker 1>Gutted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dylan.</v>

309
00:18:14.790 --> 00:18:19.500
<v Speaker 1>Cut It on the keynote.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was she touching?</v>

310
00:18:20.030 --> 00:18:20.600
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kendig,</v>

311
00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:25.600
<v Speaker 1>Olivia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So data that shows that includes killing</v>

312
00:18:25.681 --> 00:18:28.500
<v Speaker 1>titans even if they aren't monsters </v>
<v Speaker 1>after all,</v>

313
00:18:28.620 --> 00:18:31.590
<v Speaker 1>but rather people and during a terrible </v>
<v Speaker 1>fate,</v>

314
00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:36.840
<v Speaker 1>anything is justified if it means </v>
<v Speaker 1>keeping society as it is intact.</v>

315
00:18:37.500 --> 00:18:40.230
<v Speaker 1>So what do you think wise?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Crack his attack on Titan.</v>

316
00:18:40.231 --> 00:18:43.620
<v Speaker 1>A lesson on how power works or is there </v>
<v Speaker 1>something we missed?</v>

317
