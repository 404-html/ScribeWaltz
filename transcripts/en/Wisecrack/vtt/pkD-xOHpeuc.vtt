1
00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:03.893
<v Speaker 1>Hey wisecrack jared here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we've got a special quick take to </v>

2
00:00:06.241 --> 00:00:09.240
<v Speaker 1>prime you guys for the release of blade </v>
<v Speaker 1>runner 2049.</v>

3
00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:10.403
<v Speaker 1>As you might guess,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're big fans of the original blade </v>

4
00:00:12.601 --> 00:00:16.800
<v Speaker 1>runner and are super excited to see how </v>
<v Speaker 1>the sql not only continues the plot,</v>

5
00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:17.663
<v Speaker 1>but develops the themes that made the </v>
<v Speaker 1>original so legendary to wet our </v>

6
00:00:20.971 --> 00:00:21.804
<v Speaker 1>appetite.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even more crunchy roll has a first look </v>

7
00:00:24.061 --> 00:00:27.780
<v Speaker 1>on a 15 minute blade runner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>animate directed by cowboy bebop.</v>

8
00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.610
<v Speaker 1>Mega director Shin is Watson Nabi that </v>
<v Speaker 1>bridges the original and the sequel,</v>

9
00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:33.743
<v Speaker 1>and it's actually really good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not only does it carry on the same </v>

10
00:00:36.181 --> 00:00:39.600
<v Speaker 1>visual style and the Neos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anwar pitch black tone,</v>

11
00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:40.553
<v Speaker 1>but it reflects on many of the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>themes and symbols present in the </v>

12
00:00:43.381 --> 00:00:44.214
<v Speaker 1>original.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So big thanks to crunch roll role for </v>

13
00:00:45.781 --> 00:00:49.830
<v Speaker 1>giving us an exclusive sneak peek at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>short and making this video possible.</v>

14
00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:51.113
<v Speaker 1>Blade runner is a really dense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>profound film full of symbols that also </v>

15
00:00:54.871 --> 00:00:55.704
<v Speaker 1>make an appearance in blackout 2022.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's unpack how these symbols give </v>

16
00:00:59.401 --> 00:01:00.234
<v Speaker 1>us a better understanding of what it </v>
<v Speaker 1>means to be human and perhaps derive a </v>

17
00:01:03.391 --> 00:01:05.580
<v Speaker 1>sense of what we can expect from blade </v>
<v Speaker 1>runner.</v>

18
00:01:05.581 --> 00:01:06.480
<v Speaker 1>Twenty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>49.</v>

19
00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:07.663
<v Speaker 1>Welcome to this wisecrack quick take on </v>
<v Speaker 1>blade runner and blackout 20 slash 22 </v>

20
00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.740
<v Speaker 1>and heads up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This discussion will spoil some key plot</v>

21
00:01:13.741 --> 00:01:16.470
<v Speaker 1>points of the anime.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you want to watch it right now for</v>

22
00:01:16.471 --> 00:01:19.440
<v Speaker 1>free,</v>
<v Speaker 1>had you crunchy roll.com/wise</v>

23
00:01:19.441 --> 00:01:20.274
<v Speaker 1>crack.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's get to first a quick recap of </v>

24
00:01:22.681 --> 00:01:27.681
<v Speaker 1>blackout 2022 to replicants Trixie and </v>
<v Speaker 1>ag go on a mission to destroy a database</v>

25
00:01:28.321 --> 00:01:31.260
<v Speaker 1>that holds a registry of all replicants </v>
<v Speaker 1>on earth.</v>

26
00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:32.303
<v Speaker 1>One of the primary themes of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>original is interrogating the line </v>

27
00:01:34.651 --> 00:01:38.610
<v Speaker 1>between human and Automaton,</v>
<v Speaker 1>both blade runner and blackout 20.</v>

28
00:01:38.611 --> 00:01:41.850
<v Speaker 1>To explore this dynamic using three key </v>
<v Speaker 1>symbols,</v>

29
00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:43.650
<v Speaker 1>the eye,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the doll,</v>

30
00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:44.603
<v Speaker 1>and the dove.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Number one on the original blade runner </v>

31
00:01:47.941 --> 00:01:50.450
<v Speaker 1>places,</v>
<v Speaker 1>significant emphasis on eyes.</v>

32
00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:55.050
<v Speaker 1>The void contest examines eyes to detect</v>
<v Speaker 1>if someone is a replicant or not.</v>

33
00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.380
<v Speaker 1>Roy and Leon meet the designer of their </v>
<v Speaker 1>own eyes,</v>

34
00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:00.383
<v Speaker 1>and Roy even kills his own maker by </v>
<v Speaker 1>giving him an extreme bits of Iq </v>

35
00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:06.610
<v Speaker 1>puncture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Similarly in blackout,</v>

36
00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:08.940
<v Speaker 1>the characters right eyes are coated </v>
<v Speaker 1>with a mark,</v>

37
00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:09.803
<v Speaker 1>identifying them as replicants Bi is </v>
<v Speaker 1>also relevant and how replicants and </v>

38
00:02:13.531 --> 00:02:17.190
<v Speaker 1>humans define themselves through images </v>
<v Speaker 1>and symbols.</v>

39
00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:20.843
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the replicant Leon is obsessed with </v>

40
00:02:22.561 --> 00:02:23.394
<v Speaker 1>finding photos because these visual </v>
<v Speaker 1>symbols reinforced the idea that he has </v>

41
00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:27.893
<v Speaker 1>a history proof of having existed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's actually a pretty interesting </v>

42
00:02:31.681 --> 00:02:34.770
<v Speaker 1>postmodern commentary here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Many philosophers,</v>

43
00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:37.170
<v Speaker 1>including wisecrack favorite genre,</v>
<v Speaker 1>beaudry yard,</v>

44
00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:41.670
<v Speaker 1>have discussed how all of us now think </v>
<v Speaker 1>of our past as a series of images,</v>

45
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.560
<v Speaker 1>photo albums,</v>
<v Speaker 1>instagram,</v>

46
00:02:43.561 --> 00:02:44.820
<v Speaker 1>facebook,</v>
<v Speaker 1>photos,</v>

47
00:02:44.821 --> 00:02:46.470
<v Speaker 1>et cetera.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Our Past,</v>

48
00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:49.890
<v Speaker 1>like the replicants,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has just become a series of photos,</v>

49
00:02:49.891 --> 00:02:51.660
<v Speaker 1>symbols,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or video images.</v>

50
00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:52.673
<v Speaker 1>Similarly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the main drive of the protagonists in </v>

51
00:02:54.541 --> 00:02:59.130
<v Speaker 1>blackout to destroy a database registry </v>
<v Speaker 1>that lists them as replicants.</v>

52
00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:02.560
<v Speaker 1>By removing these signs that defined </v>
<v Speaker 1>them as not human,</v>

53
00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:06.790
<v Speaker 1>they are destroying the one thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>separating them from humanity.</v>

54
00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:09.790
<v Speaker 1>Number two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the dol in blade runner,</v>

55
00:03:09.791 --> 00:03:11.680
<v Speaker 1>Chris,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a pleasure model,</v>

56
00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:16.450
<v Speaker 1>just like trixie disguises herself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a doll amongst other nonsense toys,</v>

57
00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:20.620
<v Speaker 1>while in blackout 20 slash 22,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trixie carries a stuffed doll.</v>

58
00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:24.110
<v Speaker 1>In both cases,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the dol indicates how humans distinguish</v>

59
00:03:24.111 --> 00:03:24.944
<v Speaker 1>themselves from replicants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're largely considered to be doll </v>

60
00:03:27.651 --> 00:03:30.910
<v Speaker 1>like lifeless Automaton,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but why?</v>

61
00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:32.043
<v Speaker 1>Philosopher David Hume argues that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>only thing that distinguishes us from </v>

62
00:03:34.961 --> 00:03:35.794
<v Speaker 1>dolls is our experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He says that mankind is nothing but a </v>

63
00:03:39.521 --> 00:03:42.340
<v Speaker 1>bundle or collection of different </v>
<v Speaker 1>perceptions.</v>

64
00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:43.413
<v Speaker 1>This bundle theory says that all we are </v>
<v Speaker 1>is just a collection of experiences and </v>

65
00:03:47.591 --> 00:03:49.870
<v Speaker 1>memories held together in a sack of </v>
<v Speaker 1>meat,</v>

66
00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:52.750
<v Speaker 1>and this is how we define ourselves as </v>
<v Speaker 1>human,</v>

67
00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:57.010
<v Speaker 1>but as the film points out replicants to</v>
<v Speaker 1>find themselves in the same way,</v>

68
00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:59.850
<v Speaker 1>even though her memories are </v>
<v Speaker 1>artificially implanted,</v>

69
00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:04.360
<v Speaker 1>Rachel is convinced of her own humanity </v>
<v Speaker 1>and even carries a photo of herself as a</v>

70
00:04:04.361 --> 00:04:06.100
<v Speaker 1>child.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Implanted or not.</v>

71
00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:08.590
<v Speaker 1>If you have memories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the difference?</v>

72
00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:12.630
<v Speaker 1>Utilizing their experience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>both trixie and Chris Challenged,</v>

73
00:04:12.631 --> 00:04:13.464
<v Speaker 1>they're prescribed faked shedding this </v>
<v Speaker 1>idea of the doll and asserting their </v>

74
00:04:16.421 --> 00:04:17.170
<v Speaker 1>humanity.</v>

75
00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:20.900
<v Speaker 1>This is why trixie leaves her doll </v>
<v Speaker 1>behind as she goes into ass whooping.</v>

76
00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:24.250
<v Speaker 1>So who is to say they're just lifeless </v>
<v Speaker 1>dolls?</v>

77
00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:26.040
<v Speaker 1>Number three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the dump,</v>

78
00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:30.670
<v Speaker 1>the final symbol has caused so much </v>
<v Speaker 1>debate since the release of the original</v>

79
00:04:30.671 --> 00:04:31.504
<v Speaker 1>blade runner and its appearance in 20 </v>
<v Speaker 1>slash 22 makes it all the more </v>

80
00:04:34.721 --> 00:04:38.920
<v Speaker 1>significant in the original movie Roy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he gives his famous speech while holding</v>

81
00:04:38.921 --> 00:04:41.800
<v Speaker 1>a dove and releases it just as he </v>
<v Speaker 1>expires.</v>

82
00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:42.873
<v Speaker 1>Similarly in 2022,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trixie observes a dub as she sails </v>

83
00:04:45.971 --> 00:04:46.804
<v Speaker 1>through the air before coming to a </v>
<v Speaker 1>crashing end herself because of how </v>

84
00:04:49.841 --> 00:04:53.680
<v Speaker 1>briefly the doves are seen and </v>
<v Speaker 1>importantly when they are seeing,</v>

85
00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:58.450
<v Speaker 1>it's easy to interpret them in a number </v>
<v Speaker 1>of ways as a symbol of life departing or</v>

86
00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:02.860
<v Speaker 1>alternatively as life continuing or even</v>
<v Speaker 1>as just another Automaton,</v>

87
00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:03.873
<v Speaker 1>as blade runner suggests,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most organic animals no longer exist if </v>

88
00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:07.923
<v Speaker 1>you like our own</v>

89
00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:15.110
<v Speaker 1>sort official.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course it is.</v>

90
00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:16.123
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our favorite interpretation of the dove </v>

91
00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:20.390
<v Speaker 1>is that it represents a certain kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>freedom.</v>

92
00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:21.433
<v Speaker 1>The sort of freedom the characters yearn</v>
<v Speaker 1>for can be found in what soren </v>

93
00:05:24.081 --> 00:05:24.914
<v Speaker 1>kierkegaard refers to as despair.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kierkegaard defines despair is the </v>

94
00:05:28.221 --> 00:05:32.390
<v Speaker 1>tension between life and are inevitable </v>
<v Speaker 1>death and the search for meaning they're</v>

95
00:05:32.391 --> 00:05:34.190
<v Speaker 1>in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While for Keaker Guard,</v>

96
00:05:34.191 --> 00:05:37.670
<v Speaker 1>this was solved by aligning yourself </v>
<v Speaker 1>with God for the replicants,</v>

97
00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:42.930
<v Speaker 1>no heaven or hell before us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This world is all gone,</v>

98
00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:47.720
<v Speaker 1>so like a lot of people living in are </v>
<v Speaker 1>more secular age.</v>

99
00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:48.703
<v Speaker 1>We free ourselves from this tension or </v>
<v Speaker 1>despair by being conscious of that </v>

100
00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:58.080
<v Speaker 1>understanding and defining ourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is exactly the replicants do.</v>

101
00:05:58.460 --> 00:05:59.293
<v Speaker 1>Roy spends the film fighting this </v>
<v Speaker 1>tension by searching for more life </v>

102
00:06:01.971 --> 00:06:06.110
<v Speaker 1>beyond his four year expiration date and</v>
<v Speaker 1>tell when he feels his body beginning to</v>

103
00:06:06.111 --> 00:06:10.220
<v Speaker 1>degrade and his end is near.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He chooses to fight his programming as a</v>

104
00:06:10.221 --> 00:06:14.750
<v Speaker 1>combat model and spares deckerd.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He then delivers this speech that brings</v>

105
00:06:14.751 --> 00:06:16.860
<v Speaker 1>tears to the eyes of nerds everywhere.</v>

106
00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:22.120
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the moment will be lost in time,</v>

107
00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:31.350
<v Speaker 2>like tears,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

108
00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:37.280
<v Speaker 1>referring to the bundle of experiences </v>
<v Speaker 1>that he has seen throughout his life.</v>

109
00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:38.473
<v Speaker 1>Perhaps this indicates that he has </v>
<v Speaker 1>finally defied his programming by </v>

110
00:06:41.001 --> 00:06:45.620
<v Speaker 1>defining himself and thus is free of his</v>
<v Speaker 1>existential despair,</v>

111
00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:49.370
<v Speaker 1>even if he didn't get more life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unlike in the original movie,</v>

112
00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:50.263
<v Speaker 1>Trixie and Iggy are seeking the power to</v>
<v Speaker 1>allow them to define themselves by </v>

113
00:06:54.141 --> 00:06:58.010
<v Speaker 1>destroying the registry that the humans </v>
<v Speaker 1>use to define them as replicants.</v>

114
00:06:58.310 --> 00:06:59.143
<v Speaker 1>In doing this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we see trixie breakaway from her </v>

115
00:07:00.501 --> 00:07:04.760
<v Speaker 1>programming as a pleasure doll and </v>
<v Speaker 1>become a backflipping baptist,</v>

116
