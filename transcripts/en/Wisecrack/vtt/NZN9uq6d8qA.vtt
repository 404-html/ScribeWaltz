1
00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:05.850
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever won some asshole who needs</v>
<v Speaker 1>a haircut here?</v>

2
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.530
<v Speaker 1>We just got back from deadpool two and </v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the shares.</v>

3
00:00:08.531 --> 00:00:09.960
<v Speaker 1>Some thoughts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it funny?</v>

4
00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:11.003
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it the same thing as deadpool one </v>

5
00:00:12.511 --> 00:00:15.240
<v Speaker 1>except replace romance with family also?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

6
00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:16.163
<v Speaker 1>but there's one particular scene we </v>
<v Speaker 1>wanted to talk about it just for for </v>

7
00:00:18.421 --> 00:00:19.254
<v Speaker 1>Logan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but deadpool two spoils logan pretty </v>

8
00:00:21.091 --> 00:00:23.820
<v Speaker 1>much immediately,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so consider yourself warned.</v>

9
00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:24.953
<v Speaker 1>At the beginning of the film,</v>
<v Speaker 1>deadpool holds a music box of Wolverine </v>

10
00:00:27.301 --> 00:00:30.270
<v Speaker 1>from the end of Logan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It depicts him impaled upon a tree.</v>

11
00:00:30.271 --> 00:00:31.104
<v Speaker 1>After defeating x 24,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he laments that Logan has stolen his </v>

12
00:00:34.021 --> 00:00:35.340
<v Speaker 1>fire,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so to make it right,</v>

13
00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:36.383
<v Speaker 1>dead pool will also die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Deadpool's Hugh Jackman obsession is </v>

14
00:00:39.511 --> 00:00:41.550
<v Speaker 1>well documented,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in deadpool two,</v>

15
00:00:41.551 --> 00:00:42.384
<v Speaker 1>it takes on a new layer of relevance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One can view the entire film as one </v>

16
00:00:46.711 --> 00:00:50.790
<v Speaker 1>giant joke at Logan's expense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So welcome to this wise crack quick take</v>

<v Speaker 1>it's super easy to get started.</v>

33
00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.270
<v Speaker 1>Thanks to wix again and now back to </v>
<v Speaker 1>violence,</v>

34
00:01:42.271 --> 00:01:43.920
<v Speaker 1>cynicism and fourth wall breaks.</v>

35
00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:45.143
<v Speaker 1>So first a quick recap.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Deadpool two follows the MERC with a </v>

36
00:01:47.761 --> 00:01:50.430
<v Speaker 1>mouth as he's going through a bit of an </v>
<v Speaker 1>emo phase.</v>

37
00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:51.383
<v Speaker 1>His plans to start a family with Vanessa</v>
<v Speaker 1>Goto when she gets murdered by some bad </v>

38
00:01:55.111 --> 00:01:59.190
<v Speaker 1>guys after trying to kill himself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's brought on as an x men trainee.</v>

39
00:01:59.191 --> 00:02:02.400
<v Speaker 1>Where he encounters a rotund young </v>
<v Speaker 1>firestarter named Russell,</v>

40
00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.400
<v Speaker 1>tired of being abused by his boarding </v>
<v Speaker 1>school staff.</v>

41
00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:06.263
<v Speaker 1>Russell starts lashing out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Deadpool decides to dish out some </v>

42
00:02:08.971 --> 00:02:12.150
<v Speaker 1>vigilante justice on his abusers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so he,</v>

43
00:02:12.151 --> 00:02:12.984
<v Speaker 1>along with Russell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>end up in Buton prison with power </v>

44
00:02:15.181 --> 00:02:16.014
<v Speaker 1>inhibiting collars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Deadpool breaks free when the time </v>

45
00:02:18.241 --> 00:02:21.780
<v Speaker 1>traveling cable infiltrates the prison </v>
<v Speaker 1>to assassinate Russell.</v>

46
00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.883
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because it grows up to be a pretty big </v>

47
00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:27.960
<v Speaker 1>who kills cables,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wife and child.</v>

48
00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.960
<v Speaker 1>After playing some cat and mouse russell</v>
<v Speaker 1>for sakes,</v>

49
00:02:30.961 --> 00:02:31.794
<v Speaker 1>deadpool to join up with the juggernaut </v>
<v Speaker 1>and kill his school master causing </v>

50
00:02:35.011 --> 00:02:38.130
<v Speaker 1>deadpool and cable to team up as part of</v>
<v Speaker 1>their deal.</v>

51
00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:41.940
<v Speaker 1>Deadpool gets to try to stop Russell </v>
<v Speaker 1>from killing his schoolmaster.</v>

52
00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.890
<v Speaker 1>Thus breaking the chain of events that </v>
<v Speaker 1>turns him into key.</v>

53
00:02:44.891 --> 00:02:47.940
<v Speaker 1>We voldemort if not cable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gets to kill him.</v>

54
00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:52.860
<v Speaker 1>When you put the two film side by side,</v>
<v Speaker 1>deadpool two is a lot like logan.</v>

55
00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:56.250
<v Speaker 1>Besides the healing factor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>both films follow two mutants,</v>

56
00:02:56.251 --> 00:02:59.560
<v Speaker 1>trying to help younger mutants being </v>
<v Speaker 1>hunted down by guys.</v>

57
00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:00.543
<v Speaker 1>It's also worth noting that both of </v>
<v Speaker 1>these bad guys have robo arms slash </v>

58
00:03:03.821 --> 00:03:04.654
<v Speaker 1>hands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Both films also have an adult child </v>

59
00:03:06.521 --> 00:03:07.354
<v Speaker 1>relationship.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where the child is kind of a mirror for </v>

60
00:03:09.221 --> 00:03:10.054
<v Speaker 1>the protagonist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wade Wilson had a crappy family life </v>

61
00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:15.160
<v Speaker 1>which makes him empathetic to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>orphans Russell,</v>

62
00:03:15.161 --> 00:03:18.520
<v Speaker 1>who's only father figure conducts cruel </v>
<v Speaker 1>experiments on him.</v>

63
00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:19.653
<v Speaker 1>As a result,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he realizes Russell's and is beyond the </v>

64
00:03:22.421 --> 00:03:25.720
<v Speaker 1>child's choice and thus he deserves a </v>
<v Speaker 1>chance.</v>

65
00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:28.930
<v Speaker 1>Similarly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Logan sympathizes with Laura because she</v>

66
00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:32.050
<v Speaker 1>like him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was engineered as a killing machine.</v>

67
00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:35.860
<v Speaker 1>Both our heroes Die Sorta to save said </v>
<v Speaker 1>child.</v>

68
00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:40.210
<v Speaker 1>So here's the thing in logan and his </v>
<v Speaker 1>sacrifice has a particular meaning,</v>

69
00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:44.980
<v Speaker 1>one that we've covered before Logan and </v>
<v Speaker 1>not set aside his violent past.</v>

70
00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:49.270
<v Speaker 1>No matter how hard he tries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he tries to spare laura the violent life</v>

71
00:03:49.271 --> 00:03:50.104
<v Speaker 1>he had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but can only do so by reluctantly </v>

72
00:03:52.271 --> 00:03:53.104
<v Speaker 1>becoming one last time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The animal like Wolverine Logan and his </v>

73
00:03:57.191 --> 00:04:00.370
<v Speaker 1>Wolverine Fur Sona die so that Laura may</v>
<v Speaker 1>live.</v>

74
00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:02.890
<v Speaker 1>This may sound a lot like Vanessa's </v>
<v Speaker 1>line.</v>

75
00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:03.963
<v Speaker 1>Give us a chance to be better than you </v>
<v Speaker 1>used to be about how children give </v>

76
00:04:06.461 --> 00:04:07.294
<v Speaker 1>people the opportunity to make better </v>
<v Speaker 1>versions of themselves and on the </v>

77
00:04:09.881 --> 00:04:12.010
<v Speaker 1>surface,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is kind of happening,</v>

78
00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:15.090
<v Speaker 1>at least in a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did poorly in way deadpool.</v>

79
00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:15.933
<v Speaker 1>Who has a violent past like wolverine </v>
<v Speaker 1>does not want Russell to get that </v>

80
00:04:19.091 --> 00:04:23.050
<v Speaker 1>initial taste of murder because it will </v>
<v Speaker 1>set him down a dark path.</v>

81
00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:24.033
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>does deadpool want Russell to avoid </v>

82
00:04:25.091 --> 00:04:27.310
<v Speaker 1>being a jaded hitman for higher?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

83
00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:30.130
<v Speaker 1>not exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He has to make sure Russell doesn't kill</v>

84
00:04:30.131 --> 00:04:30.964
<v Speaker 1>his school master,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he seems to have no problem doing </v>

85
00:04:33.221 --> 00:04:34.870
<v Speaker 1>the killing himself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

86
00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:36.310
<v Speaker 1>this is deadpool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>After all,</v>

87
00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:37.353
<v Speaker 1>at the end of the film,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we think deadpool has turned a new leaf </v>

88
00:04:39.731 --> 00:04:44.110
<v Speaker 1>and decided to spare the school master </v>
<v Speaker 1>and perhaps take colossus words to heart</v>

89
00:04:44.111 --> 00:04:46.780
<v Speaker 1>from early in the film that he's not </v>
<v Speaker 1>judge,</v>

90
00:04:46.781 --> 00:04:49.720
<v Speaker 1>jury and executioner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and with deadpool sparing of him,</v>

91
00:04:49.721 --> 00:04:51.340
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's progress,</v>

92
00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:52.503
<v Speaker 1>but it was all a stall tactic so that </v>
<v Speaker 1>depender could make like daisy Buchanan </v>

93
00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:58.480
<v Speaker 1>and commit some light vehicular </v>
<v Speaker 1>manslaughter.</v>

94
00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:02.050
<v Speaker 1>Just like the end of deadpool one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wade is still not.</v>

95
00:05:02.051 --> 00:05:02.884
<v Speaker 1>Colossus is image of heroics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but perhaps this comparison works on </v>

96
00:05:06.401 --> 00:05:07.234
<v Speaker 1>another level.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It Logan is about sparing a younger </v>

97
00:05:09.161 --> 00:05:11.380
<v Speaker 1>generation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the violence of their elders.</v>

98
00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:15.190
<v Speaker 1>Then deadpool two maybe about spearing a</v>
<v Speaker 1>younger generation,</v>

99
00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:17.260
<v Speaker 1>the cynicism of their elders.</v>

100
00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:21.070
<v Speaker 1>The idea that deadpool is cynical is </v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty captain obvious,</v>

101
00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:23.980
<v Speaker 1>inhabits all the tropes of a superhero </v>
<v Speaker 1>wild,</v>

102
00:05:23.981 --> 00:05:27.400
<v Speaker 1>mocking them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He shamelessly advertises but does so in</v>

103
00:05:27.401 --> 00:05:29.980
<v Speaker 1>a self deprecating style that makes it </v>
<v Speaker 1>palatable.</v>

104
00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:31.053
<v Speaker 1>In one instance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tequila ads had poorly plaster deadpool </v>

105
00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:36.490
<v Speaker 1>faces on them that we're an actual </v>
<v Speaker 1>partnership.</v>

106
00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:38.230
<v Speaker 1>He also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>above all else,</v>

107
00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:42.520
<v Speaker 1>refuses to take anything seriously </v>
<v Speaker 1>including his own torture.</v>

108
00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:45.280
<v Speaker 1>If deadpool,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the character is so cynical,</v>

109
00:05:45.281 --> 00:05:49.780
<v Speaker 1>so willing to trivialize everything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>perhaps it's because he never really had</v>

110
00:05:49.781 --> 00:05:50.614
<v Speaker 1>a family.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This negative part of his character </v>

111
00:05:52.211 --> 00:05:53.044
<v Speaker 1>manifests itself and heightens the </v>
<v Speaker 1>conflict when he belittles Russell </v>

112
00:05:56.201 --> 00:05:59.360
<v Speaker 1>within earshot and claims not to care </v>
<v Speaker 1>about him,</v>

113
00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:03.230
<v Speaker 1>and if this ill fitting role model has </v>
<v Speaker 1>also abandoned Russell,</v>

114
00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:05.960
<v Speaker 1>why should Russell think anyone could </v>
<v Speaker 1>love him?</v>

115
00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:09.560
<v Speaker 1>At the end of the film,</v>
<v Speaker 1>deadpool approaches Russell and embraces</v>

116
00:06:09.561 --> 00:06:13.820
<v Speaker 1>him to try to stop his pyromania spree,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but Russell doesn't buy it,</v>

117
00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:15.170
<v Speaker 1>and why should he?</v>

118
00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:18.050
<v Speaker 1>All the adults in his life have been </v>
<v Speaker 1>assholes.</v>

119
00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:19.333
<v Speaker 1>The implication is because Russell </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't trust anyone because he's never </v>

120
00:06:22.251 --> 00:06:24.950
<v Speaker 1>had a family.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He is without hope,</v>

121
00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:26.023
<v Speaker 1>but when cable tries to shoot him dead,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pool takes the void proving to Russell </v>

122
00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:30.433
<v Speaker 1>that someone cares.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not only does this mean he doesn't have </v>

123
00:06:32.751 --> 00:06:34.430
<v Speaker 1>to grow up and killed hundreds of </v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

124
00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:37.610
<v Speaker 1>but that he should allow himself to </v>
<v Speaker 1>trust others.</v>

125
00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:41.780
<v Speaker 1>Logan died so that Laura could give up </v>
<v Speaker 1>violence and have a good life with her.</v>

126
00:06:41.781 --> 00:06:42.614
<v Speaker 1>New x family and deadpool died so </v>
<v Speaker 1>russell could give up cynicism and </v>

127
00:06:46.461 --> 00:06:47.294
<v Speaker 1>embrace his new x family.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Logan will never not be violent and </v>

128
00:06:50.871 --> 00:06:51.704
<v Speaker 1>deadpool will never not be cynical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that doesn't mean we can't try to </v>

129
00:06:55.251 --> 00:06:57.350
<v Speaker 1>help the children.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But again,</v>

130
00:06:57.500 --> 00:07:00.680
<v Speaker 1>this movie is a kind of extended joke on</v>
<v Speaker 1>Logan.</v>

131
00:07:01.130 --> 00:07:04.040
<v Speaker 1>Although deadpool has healed the </v>
<v Speaker 1>cynicism of Russell,</v>

132
00:07:04.130 --> 00:07:04.963
<v Speaker 1>the film still takes the opposite </v>
<v Speaker 1>approach rather than a sad heartfelt </v>

133
00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:09.420
<v Speaker 1>ending.</v>

134
00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:10.253
<v Speaker 1>Deadpool doesn't actually die,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the bait and switch with deadpool </v>

135
00:07:13.671 --> 00:07:17.240
<v Speaker 1>sparing the school master as a ruse to </v>
<v Speaker 1>let dope hinder kill him.</v>

136
00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:21.620
<v Speaker 1>It's just proof of this cynicism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So where we expect progress,</v>

137
00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:25.010
<v Speaker 1>we find none.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if we had any doubts,</v>

138
00:07:25.250 --> 00:07:29.870
<v Speaker 1>the after credit scenes show deadpool </v>
<v Speaker 1>making the entire first act irrelevant.</v>

139
00:07:30.350 --> 00:07:32.510
<v Speaker 1>And also shooting the old deadpool in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the head,</v>

140
00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:36.860
<v Speaker 1>so although deadpool may have saved </v>
<v Speaker 1>Russell from these cynical belief in not</v>

141
00:07:36.861 --> 00:07:41.030
<v Speaker 1>being able to trust anyone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the franchise itself is still as cynical</v>

142
00:07:41.031 --> 00:07:41.864
<v Speaker 1>as ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm sure commercials like this and </v>

143
00:07:44.061 --> 00:07:47.420
<v Speaker 1>this will never go away,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what do I know?</v>

144
00:07:47.540 --> 00:07:49.490
<v Speaker 1>I'm just some asshole with a youtube </v>
<v Speaker 1>channel.</v>

145
00:07:49.820 --> 00:07:50.720
