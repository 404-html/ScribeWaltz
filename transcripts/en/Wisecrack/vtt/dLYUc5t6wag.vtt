<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wise crack jared here and I promise I'm </v>

5
00:00:13.851 --> 00:00:14.684
<v Speaker 1>not here to beat a dead Tauntaun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As I'm sure everyone knows the last jet </v>

6
00:00:18.561 --> 00:00:21.470
<v Speaker 1>I pissed off a lot of fans and wise </v>
<v Speaker 1>crack.</v>

7
00:00:21.471 --> 00:00:22.304
<v Speaker 1>We've surfaced the usual rants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Luke skywalker is suddenly a green milk </v>

8
00:00:25.821 --> 00:00:26.654
<v Speaker 1>chugging coward.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Snow gets darth Maul before we know </v>

9
00:00:29.121 --> 00:00:32.180
<v Speaker 1>anything about him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Holos plan doesn't make any sense.</v>

10
00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:36.050
<v Speaker 1>The Canto bight section is boring.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Raised parents were red herring,</v>

11
00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:37.093
<v Speaker 1>marvel humor for days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is hops and of course lay hoppins </v>

12
00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:45.700
<v Speaker 1>but we're not going to spend 15 minutes </v>
<v Speaker 1>fanboy rages.</v>

13
00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:50.090
<v Speaker 1>Instead we're going to discuss how Ryan </v>
<v Speaker 1>Johnson tried to revolutionize star wars</v>

14
00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:52.760
<v Speaker 1>but did so what went wrong?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

15
00:00:52.761 --> 00:00:53.594
<v Speaker 1>to answer that and we'll need a little </v>
<v Speaker 1>help from a guy who in a roundabout way </v>

16
00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:59.330
<v Speaker 1>is responsible for making star wars star</v>
<v Speaker 1>wars.</v>

17
00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:00.830
<v Speaker 1>Nope,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not that guy.</v>

18
00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:04.220
<v Speaker 1>This guy welcome this crack condition on</v>
<v Speaker 1>the last Jedi.</v>

19
00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:05.263
<v Speaker 1>What went wrong and spoiler alert,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though I already spoiled pretty </v>

20
00:01:08.391 --> 00:01:10.700
<v Speaker 1>much everything now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>before we jump in,</v>

21
00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:12.950
<v Speaker 1>if you will allow me to get a little </v>
<v Speaker 1>Meta on you.</v>

22
00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:15.103
<v Speaker 1>The relationship between Kylo Ren and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Darth vader can be interpreted as a </v>

23
00:01:17.871 --> 00:01:18.704
<v Speaker 1>commentary on the relationship new star </v>
<v Speaker 1>wars has with the original star wars </v>

24
00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:27.350
<v Speaker 1>that you will never be as strong as </v>
<v Speaker 1>Darth Beta in the force awakens.</v>

25
00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:28.213
<v Speaker 1>Kylo ren is burdened by the task of </v>
<v Speaker 1>living up to the legend of his </v>

26
00:01:30.621 --> 00:01:33.560
<v Speaker 1>grandfather.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just as the new series has the seemingly</v>

27
00:01:33.561 --> 00:01:37.280
<v Speaker 1>impossible pressure of living up to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>legacy of the original trilogy.</v>

28
00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:38.503
<v Speaker 1>Just as Kylo ren mimics darth vader by </v>
<v Speaker 1>dressing like him and using a voice </v>

29
00:01:41.721 --> 00:01:42.554
<v Speaker 1>modulator,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though there's nothing wrong with </v>

30
00:01:43.911 --> 00:01:44.744
<v Speaker 1>his voice.</v>

31
00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:49.400
<v Speaker 1>So too does the force awakens mimic a </v>
<v Speaker 1>new hope?</v>

32
00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:52.730
<v Speaker 1>As many critics have noticed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's almost beat per beat.</v>

33
00:01:52.731 --> 00:01:55.550
<v Speaker 1>The same movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This may seem like a stretch,</v>

34
00:01:55.551 --> 00:01:59.070
<v Speaker 1>but the dynamic between smoke and Kylo </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the opening of the last Jed,</v>

35
00:01:59.071 --> 00:02:03.520
<v Speaker 1>I furthers this meter reading as snuck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tells Kylo to take off the stupid masked</v>

36
00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:08.210
<v Speaker 1>and that he shouldn't even bother </v>
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>

37
00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:10.073
<v Speaker 1>Y'All know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just a child and then ren breaks the </v>

38
00:02:15.921 --> 00:02:19.640
<v Speaker 1>mask a might as well go and throw Luke's</v>
<v Speaker 1>light saber off a cliff.</v>

39
00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:20.773
<v Speaker 1>Oh wait.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Johnson is telegraphing to his audience </v>

40
00:02:23.151 --> 00:02:26.240
<v Speaker 1>that this will no longer be a rehash of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the original trilogy.</v>

41
00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:27.373
<v Speaker 1>The film will be a radical subversion of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the star wars formula for the new star </v>

42
00:02:30.921 --> 00:02:33.920
<v Speaker 1>wars to live the old star wars must die,</v>

43
00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:38.320
<v Speaker 2>but the time if you have to</v>

44
00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:39.773
<v Speaker 1>with the last Jedi,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brian Johnson isn't interested in </v>

45
00:02:41.761 --> 00:02:45.150
<v Speaker 1>recycling old star wars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's interested in progress,</v>

46
00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:47.430
<v Speaker 1>not only progressing the franchise </v>
<v Speaker 1>itself,</v>

47
00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:49.890
<v Speaker 1>but the landscape of a certain galaxy </v>
<v Speaker 1>far,</v>

48
00:02:49.891 --> 00:02:52.680
<v Speaker 1>far away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In order to progress the franchise,</v>

49
00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:53.543
<v Speaker 1>Johnson abrasively undermines the troops</v>
<v Speaker 1>and traditions that characterize the </v>

50
00:02:56.791 --> 00:02:59.100
<v Speaker 1>previous fields.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas Luke Skywalker,</v>

51
00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:03.880
<v Speaker 1>the son of noble blood raise parents are</v>
<v Speaker 1>just degenerate.</v>

52
00:03:03.881 --> 00:03:08.881
<v Speaker 1>Why knows nobody filthy junk traders.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So do you offer drinking money?</v>

53
00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:10.743
<v Speaker 1>Our heroes are now janitors and </v>
<v Speaker 1>mechanics instead of politicians and </v>

54
00:03:14.021 --> 00:03:17.140
<v Speaker 1>princesses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Luke is no longer the idealistic hero.</v>

55
00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:20.440
<v Speaker 1>He's a failed nephew,</v>
<v Speaker 1>murderer slash Slovenian philosopher,</v>

56
00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:22.390
<v Speaker 1>Yoda.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It goes from symbol of Jedi.</v>

57
00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:26.680
<v Speaker 1>Heidi two would be booked burner and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>jet I order kind of sucks.</v>

58
00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:29.920
<v Speaker 2>Lesson two,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now that they're extinct,</v>

59
00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:30.783
<v Speaker 2>the jet I or romanticize deified.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you strip away the myth and look at </v>

60
00:03:34.511 --> 00:03:38.110
<v Speaker 2>their deeds legacy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if the Jeddah is failure,</v>

61
00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:40.150
<v Speaker 2>hypocrisy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hubris,</v>

62
00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:42.340
<v Speaker 2>that's not true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>At the height of their powers,</v>

63
00:03:42.341 --> 00:03:44.020
<v Speaker 2>they allow.city</v>
<v Speaker 2>has to rise,</v>

64
00:03:44.021 --> 00:03:48.310
<v Speaker 2>create the empire and wipe them out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a Jedi master who was responsible</v>

65
00:03:48.311 --> 00:03:49.300
<v Speaker 2>for the training,</v>

66
00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:54.200
<v Speaker 1>ub Darth vader.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you might be asking why on everything</v>

67
00:03:54.201 --> 00:03:56.210
<v Speaker 1>that defined the previous films.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

68
00:03:56.211 --> 00:03:59.720
<v Speaker 1>because turns out the events of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>previous films didn't really lead to any</v>

69
00:03:59.721 --> 00:04:02.060
<v Speaker 1>progress.</v>
<v Speaker 1>After the collapse of the empire,</v>

70
00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:06.080
<v Speaker 1>a nearly identical Nazi inspired </v>
<v Speaker 1>fascistic order has risen.</v>

71
00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:09.620
<v Speaker 1>So clearly something is wrong in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>galaxy if this keeps happening.</v>

72
00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:12.560
<v Speaker 1>So what's to blame for this reemergence </v>
<v Speaker 1>of evil?</v>

73
00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:13.603
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Johnson seems to suggest it's are </v>

74
00:04:14.661 --> 00:04:17.570
<v Speaker 1>inadequate conception of good and evil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But wait,</v>

75
00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:18.463
<v Speaker 1>start divisions between good and evil </v>
<v Speaker 1>are what the entire star wars mythology </v>

76
00:04:21.321 --> 00:04:23.840
<v Speaker 1>has been built around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the dark side,</v>

77
00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:25.430
<v Speaker 1>not the dark nuance.</v>

78
00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:30.470
<v Speaker 1>And here's where the movie almost gets </v>
<v Speaker 1>really smart.</v>

79
00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:31.633
<v Speaker 1>As many of you may know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>George Lucas crafted the original </v>

80
00:04:33.681 --> 00:04:34.514
<v Speaker 1>trilogy point for point around a book </v>
<v Speaker 1>called the hero with a thousand faces </v>

81
00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:38.953
<v Speaker 1>written by Joseph Campbell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The book sets forth a kind of universal </v>

82
00:04:41.391 --> 00:04:45.410
<v Speaker 1>story structure from which myth stories </v>
<v Speaker 1>and literature all borrow,</v>

83
00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:48.200
<v Speaker 1>which is why the structure is called the</v>
<v Speaker 1>monomyth,</v>

84
00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:49.393
<v Speaker 1>but instead of simply recycling </v>
<v Speaker 1>Campbell's monomyth as seen in the </v>

85
00:04:52.011 --> 00:04:52.844
<v Speaker 1>original trilogy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Johnson uses it to complicate our </v>

86
00:04:55.071 --> 00:04:57.140
<v Speaker 1>relationship with a dark side.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see,</v>

87
00:04:57.141 --> 00:04:59.930
<v Speaker 1>Campbell's monomyth is based on the work</v>
<v Speaker 1>of psychoanalysts.</v>

88
00:04:59.931 --> 00:05:00.764
<v Speaker 1>Carl,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you wrote about ideas like the </v>

89
00:05:01.971 --> 00:05:02.804
<v Speaker 1>collective unconscious and archetypes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>universal primordial images ingrained </v>

90
00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:07.393
<v Speaker 1>deep in our psyche.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those archetypes for Campbell informed </v>

91
00:05:10.131 --> 00:05:10.964
<v Speaker 1>the kind of characters that keep popping</v>
<v Speaker 1>up in stories across continents and </v>

92
00:05:14.061 --> 00:05:14.894
<v Speaker 1>cultures.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's talk about one of those </v>

93
00:05:16.221 --> 00:05:18.410
<v Speaker 1>archetypes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the shadow and how the last,</v>

94
00:05:18.411 --> 00:05:19.244
<v Speaker 1>Jed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I tries to radically redefine our </v>

95
00:05:20.451 --> 00:05:21.500
<v Speaker 1>relationship to it.</v>

96
00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:22.603
<v Speaker 1>For you and the shadow is the primal or </v>
<v Speaker 1>animal part of our unconscious that </v>

97
00:05:25.461 --> 00:05:28.130
<v Speaker 1>tends to get repressed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The dark side.</v>

98
00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:30.220
<v Speaker 1>See where we're going with this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In the monomyth,</v>

99
00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:31.063
<v Speaker 1>this dark side usually gets embodied by </v>
<v Speaker 1>a character who represents the </v>

100
00:05:33.501 --> 00:05:34.640
<v Speaker 1>shortcomings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fears,</v>

101
00:05:34.641 --> 00:05:39.200
<v Speaker 1>and anxieties of our protagonist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gollum is frodos shadow a stark reminder</v>

102
00:05:39.201 --> 00:05:42.050
<v Speaker 1>of what he could become.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you really want shadows,</v>

103
00:05:42.051 --> 00:05:45.560
<v Speaker 1>one o one look no further than darth </v>
<v Speaker 1>vader and Luke Skywalker.</v>

104
00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:50.390
<v Speaker 1>Darth vader was once a powerful Jedi who</v>
<v Speaker 1>succumbed to the dark side for Luke.</v>

105
00:05:50.391 --> 00:05:51.224
<v Speaker 1>Darth vader serves as a constant </v>
<v Speaker 1>reminder of what he could become if it </v>

106
00:05:54.111 --> 00:05:56.930
<v Speaker 1>does not conquer his fear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Master has passions.</v>

107
00:05:57.110 --> 00:06:00.950
<v Speaker 1>So confronting darth vader is more than </v>
<v Speaker 1>just a physical confrontation.</v>

108
00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:05.720
<v Speaker 1>It's an emotional and psychological one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's why Luke spares darth vader's life.</v>

109
00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:09.800
<v Speaker 1>If he were to strike him down in anger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then he's lost the battle with his inner</v>

110
00:06:09.801 --> 00:06:12.470
<v Speaker 1>demons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But we're as the old star wars wants you</v>

111
00:06:12.471 --> 00:06:17.230
<v Speaker 1>to conquer your inner demons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The new star wars has other ideas in all</v>

112
00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:18.083
<v Speaker 1>the films were meant to believe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That balance in the force is desirable </v>

113
00:06:20.871 --> 00:06:24.200
<v Speaker 1>for the good of the galaxy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You refer to the prophecy of the one who</v>

114
00:06:24.201 --> 00:06:28.610
<v Speaker 1>will bring balance to the force.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You believe it's this boy.</v>

115
00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:31.370
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the last Jedi suggests that the forces,</v>

116
00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:33.770
<v Speaker 1>something that inherently promotes </v>
<v Speaker 1>balance.</v>

117
00:06:33.890 --> 00:06:37.460
<v Speaker 1>When the darkness rises,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the force amplifies the light to balance</v>

118
00:06:37.461 --> 00:06:42.461
<v Speaker 1>it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Darkness rises to meet.</v>

119
00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:46.933
<v Speaker 1>I warned my young apprentice that as he </v>
<v Speaker 1>grew stronger is equally in the light </v>

120
00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:55.040
<v Speaker 1>would rise if we're to believe snuck </v>
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>

121
00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:55.993
<v Speaker 1>Wouldn't that mean that the inverse is </v>
<v Speaker 1>true than any powerful Jedi order would </v>

122
00:06:59.331 --> 00:07:01.670
<v Speaker 1>be met with an equally powerful dark </v>
<v Speaker 1>side?</v>

123
00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:02.713
<v Speaker 1>If so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have no choice but to read Luke's </v>

124
00:07:04.311 --> 00:07:05.144
<v Speaker 1>criticism of the Jedi order as one that </v>
<v Speaker 1>blames them in part for the cyclical </v>

125
00:07:08.871 --> 00:07:12.830
<v Speaker 1>rise and fall of these fascist empires.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While it's kind of ambiguous,</v>

126
00:07:12.831 --> 00:07:15.530
<v Speaker 1>this logical conclusion seems to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>hinted at by Luke.</v>

127
00:07:16.690 --> 00:07:17.523
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The lesson that fourth not bombed the </v>

128
00:07:21.090 --> 00:07:21.923
<v Speaker 3>jet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I to say that at the jet I died a light </v>

129
00:07:25.181 --> 00:07:27.660
<v Speaker 3>diocese bannock feel that</v>

130
00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:28.663
<v Speaker 1>with episode eight the dark side is no </v>
<v Speaker 1>longer something to be conquered by the </v>

131
00:07:32.181 --> 00:07:34.790
<v Speaker 1>valeant jetta.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I at the behest of the light side,</v>

132
00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:35.653
<v Speaker 1>because that will make the force over </v>
<v Speaker 1>correct to achieve balance leading to </v>

133
00:07:39.051 --> 00:07:43.790
<v Speaker 1>more amplifications of evil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>According to union analyst Robert H.</v>

134
00:07:43.790 --> 00:07:46.100
<v Speaker 1>Johnson.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not to be confused with Ryan Johnson,</v>

135
00:07:46.370 --> 00:07:50.360
<v Speaker 1>we shouldn't think of our dark sides as </v>
<v Speaker 1>something to merely conquer and expunge.</v>

136
00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:51.553
<v Speaker 1>Johnson says this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>active repression causes us to </v>

137
00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:54.133
<v Speaker 1>accumulate the darkness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which creates an ego split according to </v>

138
00:07:57.681 --> 00:08:00.170
<v Speaker 1>his reading of Ume.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you suppress the darkness,</v>

139
00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:02.630
<v Speaker 1>you're forced to find a scape goat </v>
<v Speaker 1>project,</v>

140
00:08:02.660 --> 00:08:06.590
<v Speaker 1>all your own ugliness onto them leading </v>
<v Speaker 1>to a never ending fight.</v>

141
00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:07.993
<v Speaker 1>This is quite literally done in the very</v>
<v Speaker 1>way the original star wars is written </v>

142
00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:15.020
<v Speaker 1>with Luke's inner demons projected onto </v>
<v Speaker 1>an evil space wizard.</v>

143
00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:18.830
<v Speaker 1>Instead of maintaining this classic </v>
<v Speaker 1>distinction between good and bad,</v>

144
00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:21.530
<v Speaker 1>both within our characters and in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>general plot,</v>

145
00:08:21.710 --> 00:08:25.100
<v Speaker 1>Ryan Johnson tries to complicate it at </v>
<v Speaker 1>every step of the way.</v>

146
00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:26.353
<v Speaker 1>As we see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>conquering evil with good hasn't done </v>

147
00:08:28.311 --> 00:08:31.670
<v Speaker 1>much for the galaxy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The empire is basically back with a sexy</v>

148
00:08:31.671 --> 00:08:35.030
<v Speaker 1>new rebranding and snuck is basically </v>
<v Speaker 1>palpatine 2.0</v>

149
00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:36.193
<v Speaker 1>in earlier star wars deek.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good bad distinction is literally black </v>

150
00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:39.913
<v Speaker 1>and white,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and thus the force awakens brings us </v>

151
00:08:41.931 --> 00:08:45.260
<v Speaker 1>right back to where we started.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So to progress the franchise.</v>

152
00:08:45.410 --> 00:08:48.140
<v Speaker 1>Ryan Johnson tweaks the basic youngest </v>
<v Speaker 1>formula.</v>

153
00:08:48.470 --> 00:08:49.303
<v Speaker 1>If you suggested that we must reconcile </v>
<v Speaker 1>our dark side with the rest of our </v>

154
00:08:52.341 --> 00:08:53.174
<v Speaker 1>personality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does the galaxy need to reconcile it's </v>

155
00:08:55.381 --> 00:08:57.630
<v Speaker 1>dark side with the larger order of </v>
<v Speaker 1>things?</v>

156
00:08:57.970 --> 00:08:59.440
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>US</v>

157
00:09:02.070 --> 00:09:04.680
<v Speaker 1>consider Benicio del Toro's character </v>
<v Speaker 1>Dj.</v>

158
00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:05.693
<v Speaker 1>Rather than upholding the traditional </v>
<v Speaker 1>distinction between purely good rebels </v>

159
00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:09.473
<v Speaker 1>and purely evil oppressors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he explores how even the good guys can </v>

160
00:09:12.751 --> 00:09:13.584
<v Speaker 1>get caught up in the darker elements of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the universe as the galaxies very own </v>

161
00:09:16.651 --> 00:09:17.484
<v Speaker 1>blackwater mercenary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the cynical Dj sees through the false </v>

162
00:09:20.371 --> 00:09:23.130
<v Speaker 1>divisions of good and evil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At least you're stealing from them</v>

163
00:09:23.180 --> 00:09:27.020
<v Speaker 2>bad guys and helping the good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>good guys.</v>

164
00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:28.093
<v Speaker 2>Bad guys made up words.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's see who formally owned his own an </v>

165
00:09:38.930 --> 00:09:43.070
<v Speaker 2>arms dealer made his bag selling weapons</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the back.</v>

166
00:09:43.071 --> 00:09:43.904
<v Speaker 2>Guys</v>

167
00:09:48.500 --> 00:09:49.333
<v Speaker 1>under good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This marks the most morally ambiguous </v>

168
00:09:51.481 --> 00:09:52.314
<v Speaker 1>moments in any star wars film when he </v>
<v Speaker 1>not only suggest that divisions between </v>

169
00:09:55.411 --> 00:09:57.930
<v Speaker 1>good and evil are insincere and </v>
<v Speaker 1>unhelpful,</v>

170
00:09:58.050 --> 00:10:01.920
<v Speaker 1>but complicates our understanding of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>rebellion as an infallible good.</v>

171
00:10:02.250 --> 00:10:03.083
<v Speaker 1>Robert Johnson sees our traditional </v>
<v Speaker 1>understanding of the light and dark </v>

172
00:10:06.091 --> 00:10:06.924
<v Speaker 1>sides as straight up dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He says that our inability to reconcile </v>

173
00:10:10.171 --> 00:10:11.004
<v Speaker 1>with our shadow and therefore our </v>
<v Speaker 1>eventual scapegoating on to others will </v>

174
00:10:14.101 --> 00:10:18.370
<v Speaker 1>inevitably end in violence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>war and racism for the last Jed,</v>

175
00:10:18.371 --> 00:10:20.760
<v Speaker 1>I rather than the good guys and bad </v>
<v Speaker 1>guys,</v>

176
00:10:20.850 --> 00:10:24.420
<v Speaker 1>there's a system at play his own machine</v>
<v Speaker 1>partner,</v>

177
00:10:26.130 --> 00:10:28.420
<v Speaker 1>live free,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't join.</v>

178
00:10:28.770 --> 00:10:32.770
<v Speaker 1>It becomes the first star wars film to </v>
<v Speaker 1>explicitly critique the galaxies,</v>

179
00:10:32.771 --> 00:10:37.270
<v Speaker 1>military economy and the exploitation </v>
<v Speaker 1>and animal rights violations inherent in</v>

180
00:10:37.271 --> 00:10:39.790
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which even heroes like Princess Leia are</v>

181
00:10:39.791 --> 00:10:42.610
<v Speaker 1>party to then shelled us to test their </v>
<v Speaker 1>weapons.</v>

182
00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:46.540
<v Speaker 1>So you might be asking at this point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>aside from being too ballsy,</v>

183
00:10:46.630 --> 00:10:48.070
<v Speaker 1>what one wrong?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

184
00:10:48.071 --> 00:10:51.820
<v Speaker 1>the movie goes out of its way to in both</v>
<v Speaker 1>form and content,</v>

185
00:10:51.910 --> 00:10:55.840
<v Speaker 1>tell us that we must kill the past,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it be the past structure of star</v>

186
00:10:55.841 --> 00:10:59.260
<v Speaker 1>wars films or the moral lens we </v>
<v Speaker 1>understood the previous films through,</v>

187
00:10:59.590 --> 00:11:02.530
<v Speaker 1>then this happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's time to little things.</v>

188
00:11:02.531 --> 00:11:03.364
<v Speaker 1>Die,</v>

189
00:11:06.070 --> 00:11:11.070
<v Speaker 2>smoke Skywalker,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jed,</v>

190
00:11:12.980 --> 00:11:15.460
<v Speaker 2>I the rebels,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let it all die,</v>

191
00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:20.770
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want you to join me.</v>

192
00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:22.033
<v Speaker 1>Ray is given a chance to end all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>dogmatism of the previous films and yet </v>

193
00:11:26.210 --> 00:11:28.730
<v Speaker 1>she says No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And from this point on,</v>

194
00:11:28.731 --> 00:11:30.980
<v Speaker 1>it's all back peddle central.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nope.</v>

195
00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:33.140
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're still holding on.</v>

196
00:11:34.100 --> 00:11:37.640
<v Speaker 1>All the things that we were convinced </v>
<v Speaker 1>need to be killed are reaffirmed,</v>

197
00:11:37.970 --> 00:11:40.730
<v Speaker 1>tearing down the heroic archetypes </v>
<v Speaker 1>inherent in the mono myth.</v>

198
00:11:41.340 --> 00:11:42.173
<v Speaker 1>Shampoo's burning advantaged with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>handful of my students slaughtered the </v>

199
00:11:48.871 --> 00:11:53.010
<v Speaker 1>rest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Layered blimps smoke.</v>

200
00:11:53.050 --> 00:11:53.883
<v Speaker 1>But</v>

201
00:11:54.340 --> 00:11:59.340
<v Speaker 2>it was me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I fail cause I was Luke Skywalker chat.</v>

202
00:12:05.341 --> 00:12:06.280
<v Speaker 2>High master</v>

203
00:12:12.450 --> 00:12:13.890
<v Speaker 1>a legend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nope.</v>

204
00:12:14.250 --> 00:12:19.250
<v Speaker 1>The legend of Luke Skywalker lives on </v>
<v Speaker 1>inspiring the galaxy once again and this</v>

205
00:12:20.401 --> 00:12:22.620
<v Speaker 1>time as an added bonus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a lie.</v>

206
00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:23.633
<v Speaker 1>Gay Necessity to tear down established </v>
<v Speaker 1>orders that delineate the division </v>

207
00:12:27.001 --> 00:12:27.900
<v Speaker 1>between good and evil.</v>

208
00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:31.380
<v Speaker 2>It's time for the Jedi to end.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nope,</v>

209
00:12:32.310 --> 00:12:34.380
<v Speaker 2>not be the last gen I</v>

210
00:12:34.910 --> 00:12:35.743
<v Speaker 1>desire to distance itself from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>established narrative structure of the </v>

211
00:12:37.761 --> 00:12:39.110
<v Speaker 1>original trilogy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nope.</v>

212
00:12:39.500 --> 00:12:42.570
<v Speaker 2>Strike me down in anger and I'll always </v>
<v Speaker 2>be with you.</v>

213
00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:43.910
<v Speaker 2>It was striking to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dot.</v>

214
00:12:44.010 --> 00:12:47.370
<v Speaker 2>I will become all powerful than one </v>
<v Speaker 2>possibly imagined.</v>

215
00:12:47.740 --> 00:12:49.240
<v Speaker 1>Get the jet I pass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nope.</v>

216
00:12:49.450 --> 00:12:50.283
<v Speaker 1>Save the books.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not that movies can't insert ideas </v>

217
00:12:52.901 --> 00:12:53.734
<v Speaker 1>and then ultimately reject them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But usually the ideological shift </v>

218
00:12:56.471 --> 00:12:59.800
<v Speaker 1>happens as the plot pushes our heroes to</v>
<v Speaker 1>reconsider their ideas.</v>

219
00:12:59.980 --> 00:13:02.090
<v Speaker 1>In interesting and thought provoking </v>
<v Speaker 1>ways.</v>

220
00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:03.153
<v Speaker 1>Instead Luke decides to reaffirm all the</v>
<v Speaker 1>antiquated ideas because he loves his </v>

221
00:13:07.511 --> 00:13:08.344
<v Speaker 1>sister.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess other reversals are equally </v>

222
00:13:10.481 --> 00:13:12.310
<v Speaker 1>perplexing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't be a hero.</v>

223
00:13:12.450 --> 00:13:17.450
<v Speaker 2>She was protecting the light.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then she will see me like</v>

224
00:13:19.250 --> 00:13:20.083
<v Speaker 1>until it's okay to be a hero and by this</v>
<v Speaker 1>point the film has made a </v>

225
00:13:23.361 --> 00:13:27.860
<v Speaker 1>psychologically sophisticated case for </v>
<v Speaker 1>why ray should team up with Ren.</v>

226
00:13:28.130 --> 00:13:32.060
<v Speaker 1>The old way doesn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jed Eyes are repressed as hell and we're</v>

227
00:13:32.061 --> 00:13:35.540
<v Speaker 1>stuck playing a galactic game of Nazi </v>
<v Speaker 1>whac-a-mole fine.</v>

228
00:13:35.690 --> 00:13:36.523
<v Speaker 1>We need a radical change,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is literally what Ren seems to be </v>

229
00:13:39.411 --> 00:13:40.244
<v Speaker 1>offering despite her faith in Rennes </v>
<v Speaker 1>essential goodness and despite Luke's </v>

230
00:13:43.671 --> 00:13:47.660
<v Speaker 1>lesson that the forces beyond good and </v>
<v Speaker 1>evil ray hesitates.</v>

231
00:13:48.050 --> 00:13:48.883
<v Speaker 1>Here's where ray and ren become opposing</v>
<v Speaker 1>stand ins for the films to potential </v>

232
00:13:52.131 --> 00:13:52.964
<v Speaker 1>moral codes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ran is the realist who knows that the </v>

233
00:13:55.311 --> 00:13:56.144
<v Speaker 1>rebels will try to impose the same moral</v>
<v Speaker 1>expectations on to ray as they did to </v>

234
00:13:59.841 --> 00:14:00.674
<v Speaker 1>luke having become well acquainted with </v>
<v Speaker 1>his bad side and his good and wisely </v>

235
00:14:04.911 --> 00:14:06.920
<v Speaker 1>calling out the folly of the false </v>
<v Speaker 1>division.</v>

236
00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:11.090
<v Speaker 1>Ren is arguably closer to finding that </v>
<v Speaker 1>youngian balance than most.</v>

237
00:14:11.480 --> 00:14:16.430
<v Speaker 1>He seems to be offering to ray exactly </v>
<v Speaker 1>what Robert Johnson and can say a person</v>

238
00:14:16.431 --> 00:14:17.264
<v Speaker 1>should strive for recognition that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ego and shadow are both part of a </v>

239
00:14:20.961 --> 00:14:21.794
<v Speaker 1>person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what's more that one literally </v>

240
00:14:23.451 --> 00:14:26.090
<v Speaker 1>cannot exist without the other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile,</v>

241
00:14:26.120 --> 00:14:28.880
<v Speaker 1>ray represents the old moral code of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Star Wars.</v>

242
00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:29.833
<v Speaker 1>The temptation to run away with her </v>
<v Speaker 1>swole new crush is ultimately overcome </v>

243
00:14:33.501 --> 00:14:34.334
<v Speaker 1>by her desire to be the good jetta I a </v>
<v Speaker 1>morally pure infallible hero who </v>

244
00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:42.620
<v Speaker 1>definitely isn't suppressing a lifetime </v>
<v Speaker 1>supply of darkness.</v>

245
00:14:42.650 --> 00:14:45.710
<v Speaker 1>No surgery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you're going to revolutionize star</v>

246
00:14:45.711 --> 00:14:46.544
<v Speaker 1>wars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>great.</v>

247
00:14:46.690 --> 00:14:49.430
<v Speaker 1>Want to reframe how we think about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>central conflict?</v>

248
00:14:49.550 --> 00:14:50.383
<v Speaker 1>Cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But spending this time abrasively </v>

249
00:14:52.401 --> 00:14:55.490
<v Speaker 1>subverting everything we love and know </v>
<v Speaker 1>about star wars.</v>

250
00:14:55.550 --> 00:14:58.010
<v Speaker 1>Just do shrug and revert back to where </v>
<v Speaker 1>we started.</v>

251
00:14:58.250 --> 00:14:59.420
<v Speaker 1>Nah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>less cool.</v>

252
00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:00.553
<v Speaker 1>But what do you think wise crack is this</v>
<v Speaker 1>latest iteration of star wars </v>

253
00:15:03.250 --> 00:15:06.830
<v Speaker 1>sacrilegious or a much needed fresh take</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the series.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Let us know what you think in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>comments and as always,</v>

257
00:15:15.710 --> 00:15:16.543
<v Speaker 1>Recently,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my social media account was hacked by a </v>

258
00:15:18.171 --> 00:15:21.050
<v Speaker 1>troll and actual living under a bridge </v>
<v Speaker 1>troll.</v>

259
00:15:21.110 --> 00:15:23.780
<v Speaker 1>He held my twitter captive unless I </v>
<v Speaker 1>could answer this.</v>

260
00:15:23.781 --> 00:15:27.590
<v Speaker 1>Brain teaser from brilliant.org</v>
<v Speaker 1>supposed to people standing in place are</v>

261
00:15:27.591 --> 00:15:30.320
<v Speaker 1>holding a rope firmly so it doesn't slip</v>
<v Speaker 1>through their hands.</v>

262
00:15:30.440 --> 00:15:33.620
<v Speaker 1>Which of the two people can apply a </v>
<v Speaker 1>greater force on the rope?</v>

263
00:15:33.650 --> 00:15:36.560
<v Speaker 1>The person was stronger muscles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the person with greater mass,</v>

264
00:15:36.590 --> 00:15:37.423
<v Speaker 1>or will they both apply equal force?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was clueless until I checked out </v>

267
00:15:45.290 --> 00:15:47.660
