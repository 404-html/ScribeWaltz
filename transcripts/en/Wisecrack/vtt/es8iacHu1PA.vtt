00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:02.110
<v Speaker 1>This video is brought to you by skill </v>
<v Speaker 1>share.</v>

2
00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:06.073
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

3
00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:08.310
<v Speaker 1>What's up guys?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jared again.</v>

4
00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:09.323
<v Speaker 1>Today we're talking about the Walt </v>
<v Speaker 1>Disney of animate hi Yao Miyazaki with </v>

5
00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:17.730
<v Speaker 1>11 feature films and over 125 major </v>
<v Speaker 1>awards under his belt.</v>

6
00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.060
<v Speaker 1>Miyazaki's become a household name even </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the West.</v>

7
00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:22.163
<v Speaker 1>So what gives the films of me as Aki and</v>
<v Speaker 1>his team of bad asses at Studio Ghibli </v>

8
00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:26.683
<v Speaker 1>that extra Miyuzaki feel well beneath </v>
<v Speaker 1>all the curse tentacle pigs and giant </v>

9
00:00:30.541 --> 00:00:31.374
<v Speaker 1>cat bear things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a cohesive philosophy at play </v>

10
00:00:33.841 --> 00:00:37.100
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Japanese religion of Shinto welcome,</v>

11
00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:37.953
<v Speaker 1>this wisecrack condition on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>philosophy of Miyazaki and you know the </v>

12
00:00:40.951 --> 00:00:41.784
<v Speaker 1>drill spoilers ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A recurrent theme throughout all of me </v>

13
00:00:44.531 --> 00:00:47.740
<v Speaker 1>as archies films is a love for nature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At times.</v>

14
00:00:47.741 --> 00:00:51.370
<v Speaker 1>This can be fairly over the top,</v>
<v Speaker 1>such as in the battle between the humans</v>

15
00:00:51.371 --> 00:00:53.230
<v Speaker 1>and the forest and princess monotone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

16
00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:54.123
<v Speaker 1>What I want is for the humans and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>forest to live in peace or the battle </v>

17
00:00:57.011 --> 00:01:00.300
<v Speaker 1>between the various armies and bugs and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Nasca of the Valley of the wind.</v>

18
00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:02.560
<v Speaker 2>Humans cannot live.</v>

19
00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:07.490
<v Speaker 1>Actually let's roll the opening credits </v>
<v Speaker 1>for Nasca for a second.</v>

20
00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:08.630
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There it is.</v>

21
00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:12.620
<v Speaker 1>The throne even comes with the World </v>
<v Speaker 1>Wildlife Fund stamp of approval.</v>

22
00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:16.130
<v Speaker 1>While we could chalk all these moments </v>
<v Speaker 1>up to me as Aki being a tree hugger,</v>

23
00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:18.800
<v Speaker 1>seriously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's actually opening a nature sanctuary</v>

24
00:01:18.801 --> 00:01:21.800
<v Speaker 1>later this year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We think it has more to do with Shinto,</v>

25
00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:25.760
<v Speaker 1>which holds a deep respect for nature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For the uninitiated,</v>

26
00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:26.623
<v Speaker 1>Shinto is an ancient Japanese religion </v>
<v Speaker 1>that believes we share our world with a </v>

27
00:01:29.691 --> 00:01:33.500
<v Speaker 1>variety of gods and spirits called Kami.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Importantly,</v>

28
00:01:33.501 --> 00:01:34.334
<v Speaker 1>comey is both singular and plural,</v>
<v Speaker 1>referring not only to the myriad of </v>

29
00:01:37.881 --> 00:01:38.714
<v Speaker 1>spirits in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also the divine essence that </v>

30
00:01:41.031 --> 00:01:41.864
<v Speaker 1>connects all things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This interconnectedness is critical to </v>

31
00:01:44.781 --> 00:01:48.560
<v Speaker 1>understanding the religion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whereas you and I might see a giant tree</v>

32
00:01:48.561 --> 00:01:49.460
<v Speaker 1>and think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

33
00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:53.170
<v Speaker 1>that's a big country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A shintoist might recognize it as a your</v>

34
00:01:53.171 --> 00:01:56.120
<v Speaker 1>machito or an object in which a god can </v>
<v Speaker 1>reside.</v>

35
00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:01.280
<v Speaker 1>It's no longer just nature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but part of the divine fabric of reality</v>

36
00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:02.263
<v Speaker 1>and as such deserves our respect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And while Japan is one of the least </v>

37
00:02:05.631 --> 00:02:06.464
<v Speaker 1>religious countries in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>over 80% of its population participates </v>

38
00:02:09.921 --> 00:02:11.720
<v Speaker 1>in Shinto traditions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Seriously.</v>

39
00:02:11.721 --> 00:02:15.320
<v Speaker 1>The only thing Japan has more of than </v>
<v Speaker 1>shrines are vending machines.</v>

40
00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:18.230
<v Speaker 1>But how does this all relate to nature </v>
<v Speaker 1>and Miyazaki?</v>

41
00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:19.423
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>according to historian Lynn white </v>

42
00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:24.740
<v Speaker 1>religion plays a large part in shaping a</v>
<v Speaker 1>culture is treatment of the environment.</v>

43
00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:28.070
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Judeo Christian tradition state that man</v>

44
00:02:28.071 --> 00:02:28.904
<v Speaker 1>has dominion over fish of the sea and </v>
<v Speaker 1>over fowl of the air and over every </v>

45
00:02:32.331 --> 00:02:33.164
<v Speaker 1>living thing that moveth upon the earth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Basically in the west nature has </v>

46
00:02:36.711 --> 00:02:39.980
<v Speaker 1>historically been our bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But in Shinto,</v>

47
00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:42.830
<v Speaker 1>because everything possesses a spiritual</v>
<v Speaker 1>component,</v>

48
00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:43.783
<v Speaker 1>the religion is non anthropocentric.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Humans aren't at the center of the </v>

49
00:02:47.391 --> 00:02:49.640
<v Speaker 1>universe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And for our boy Miyazaki,</v>

50
00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:50.533
<v Speaker 1>that means that his films deal a lot </v>
<v Speaker 1>with peace and loving between human in </v>

51
00:02:54.021 --> 00:02:54.854
<v Speaker 1>nature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you're wondering why the </v>

52
00:02:55.971 --> 00:02:58.250
<v Speaker 1>protagonist from NASA,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Valley of the wind,</v>

53
00:02:58.251 --> 00:03:01.990
<v Speaker 1>continually to make peace with some </v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty terrifying bugs.</v>

54
00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:03.033
<v Speaker 1>Well there you go.</v>

55
00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:06.410
<v Speaker 3>Please forgive us for disturbing your </v>
<v Speaker 3>nest.</v>

56
00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:10.340
<v Speaker 3>We're very sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We are not your enemies.</v>

57
00:03:10.341 --> 00:03:11.630
<v Speaker 3>We mean you no harm.</v>

58
00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:12.603
<v Speaker 1>Consider my neighbor Totoro when sisters</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sawicki and May Coosa Kabe moved to an </v>

59
00:03:16.631 --> 00:03:17.464
<v Speaker 1>idealic village out in the country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they find themselves living alongside a </v>

60
00:03:20.321 --> 00:03:23.380
<v Speaker 1>whole host of spirits in their attic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

61
00:03:23.381 --> 00:03:24.730
<v Speaker 1>running around the go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

62
00:03:24.731 --> 00:03:28.840
<v Speaker 1>or a charm that blesses a house is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>swarm of little suit sprites.</v>

63
00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:33.010
<v Speaker 1>But instead of portraying these adorable</v>
<v Speaker 1>little guys as other worldly,</v>

64
00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:37.410
<v Speaker 1>the local wise woman treats them like </v>
<v Speaker 1>familiar wildlife or a kind of ghost,</v>

65
00:03:37.411 --> 00:03:41.890
<v Speaker 1>then don't worry dear then nothing to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>afraid to have.</v>

66
00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:45.730
<v Speaker 1>If they decide you're nice people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they won't harm you.</v>

67
00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.830
<v Speaker 1>And after a I live,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just go wait.</v>

68
00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:48.753
<v Speaker 1>In this world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>spirits aren't something to fear but </v>

69
00:03:50.741 --> 00:03:51.574
<v Speaker 1>rather a part of everyday life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This casual acceptance of spirits place </v>

70
00:03:55.421 --> 00:03:56.254
<v Speaker 1>in the world and the respect they </v>
<v Speaker 1>deserve is captured in small moments </v>

71
00:03:59.291 --> 00:04:00.124
<v Speaker 1>throughout the film.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like when sought ski gives thanks to a </v>

72
00:04:01.631 --> 00:04:02.464
<v Speaker 1>local shrine for offering her shelter </v>
<v Speaker 1>from the rain or when the Coosa Kabe </v>

73
00:04:05.561 --> 00:04:06.394
<v Speaker 1>family pays respects to the your Shiro </v>
<v Speaker 1>in which the god of the forest Todaro </v>

74
00:04:09.491 --> 00:04:10.324
<v Speaker 1>lives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank you for watching over May and </v>

75
00:04:12.041 --> 00:04:12.874
<v Speaker 1>making us feel so welcome here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Please continue to look after us and </v>

76
00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:18.033
<v Speaker 1>it's through befriending these spirits,</v>
<v Speaker 1>particularly the large totaro that our </v>

77
00:04:21.221 --> 00:04:22.054
<v Speaker 1>heroes resolve the films.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Big crisis when may goes missing at the </v>

78
00:04:25.421 --> 00:04:26.400
<v Speaker 1>end,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's towed.</v>

79
00:04:26.401 --> 00:04:31.120
<v Speaker 1>Rowe who helps sought ski find her with </v>
<v Speaker 1>the help of this weird cat bus thing.</v>

80
00:04:31.121 --> 00:04:33.190
<v Speaker 1>I seriously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what to call that.</v>

81
00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:37.793
<v Speaker 1>By having his protagonist respect both </v>
<v Speaker 1>the spirit and the wildlife they </v>

82
00:04:40.711 --> 00:04:41.544
<v Speaker 1>inhabit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Miyuzaki inverts traditional Western </v>

83
00:04:43.741 --> 00:04:45.930
<v Speaker 1>views toward the environment in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>west.</v>

84
00:04:45.931 --> 00:04:49.440
<v Speaker 1>We've historically looked at the land in</v>
<v Speaker 1>terms of its instrumental value,</v>

85
00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:52.110
<v Speaker 1>what it can do for us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

86
00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:54.180
<v Speaker 1>aristotle remarked in his book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>politics.</v>

87
00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:59.070
<v Speaker 1>Nature has made all things specifically </v>
<v Speaker 1>for the sake of man and for us red,</v>

88
00:04:59.071 --> 00:04:59.904
<v Speaker 1>white and blue blooded Americans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can see this in the concept of </v>

89
00:05:02.371 --> 00:05:03.204
<v Speaker 1>manifest destiny II,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how we must spread out across the </v>

90
00:05:05.731 --> 00:05:08.790
<v Speaker 1>country and convert all this nature into</v>
<v Speaker 1>usable land.</v>

91
00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:09.923
<v Speaker 1>In short,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're consumers and the earth is our </v>

92
00:05:11.911 --> 00:05:13.290
<v Speaker 1>Walmart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

93
00:05:13.291 --> 00:05:16.110
<v Speaker 1>if we factor in that the land is imbued </v>
<v Speaker 1>with spirits,</v>

94
00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:20.100
<v Speaker 1>then we have to concede that the earth </v>
<v Speaker 1>might have some intrinsic value,</v>

95
00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:20.821
<v Speaker 1>I.</v>
<v Speaker 1>E.</v>

96
00:05:20.821 --> 00:05:21.654
<v Speaker 1>Value for its own sake,</v>
<v Speaker 1>much like haunt formulated that people </v>

97
00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:28.440
<v Speaker 1>or more broadly rational agents must be </v>
<v Speaker 1>treated as an end,</v>

98
00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:29.760
<v Speaker 1>never merely as a means.</v>

99
00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:32.940
<v Speaker 1>So too must the land which is full of </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking,</v>

100
00:05:32.941 --> 00:05:37.410
<v Speaker 1>rational spirits be treated as an end,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not as a means.</v>

101
00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:38.513
<v Speaker 1>And it's in how these two perspectives </v>
<v Speaker 1>on nature fail to meet that we find the </v>

102
00:05:41.851 --> 00:05:45.090
<v Speaker 1>root of conflict in me as archies films.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

103
00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:48.510
<v Speaker 1>look at Ponyo Miyazaki's take on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>little mermaid in it.</v>

104
00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:49.373
<v Speaker 1>The Magician Fujimoto opposes his </v>
<v Speaker 1>daughter Ponyo his desire to become a </v>

105
00:05:52.261 --> 00:05:55.920
<v Speaker 1>human on the grounds that they use the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ocean for their own gain.</v>

106
00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:56.903
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the only why Ponyo ends up meeting the </v>

107
00:05:58.791 --> 00:05:59.624
<v Speaker 1>little boys so ski in the first place is</v>
<v Speaker 1>because she gets swept up by a passing </v>

108
00:06:02.571 --> 00:06:03.830
<v Speaker 1>ship,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trawling the ocean,</v>

109
00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:04.783
<v Speaker 1>or in layman's terms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when a ship essentially rakes the ocean </v>

110
00:06:07.101 --> 00:06:07.934
<v Speaker 1>with a giant net destroying reefs and </v>
<v Speaker 1>underwater habitats all for a quick </v>

111
00:06:10.461 --> 00:06:11.294
<v Speaker 1>buck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When Fujimoto finally recovers Ponyo he </v>

112
00:06:13.371 --> 00:06:16.310
<v Speaker 1>offers some pretty scathing criticism of</v>
<v Speaker 1>mankind.</v>

113
00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:20.900
<v Speaker 1>What do you know about humans?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The score in the sea.</v>

114
00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:23.960
<v Speaker 1>They treat your home like the empty </v>
<v Speaker 1>black songs.</v>

115
00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:26.540
<v Speaker 1>That was one slung.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

116
00:06:26.541 --> 00:06:27.374
<v Speaker 1>what she wanted myself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had to leave that all behind to serve </v>

117
00:06:30.231 --> 00:06:31.340
<v Speaker 1>the earth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

118
00:06:31.341 --> 00:06:34.490
<v Speaker 1>Apparently you can't love the ocean and </v>
<v Speaker 1>be human at the same time.</v>

119
00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:35.503
<v Speaker 1>And to be fair,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this clash between intrinsic and </v>

120
00:06:37.281 --> 00:06:38.114
<v Speaker 1>instrumental value has some pretty dire </v>
<v Speaker 1>consequences because ponos father </v>

121
00:06:41.541 --> 00:06:43.760
<v Speaker 1>refuses to let his daughter become a </v>
<v Speaker 1>human.</v>

122
00:06:43.910 --> 00:06:46.430
<v Speaker 1>And because Ponyo refuses to go back to </v>
<v Speaker 1>being a fish,</v>

123
00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:49.910
<v Speaker 1>the natural order of the world begins to</v>
<v Speaker 1>fall apart.</v>

124
00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:53.510
<v Speaker 1>The moon falls closer to the sea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The waves take on a life of their own,</v>

125
00:06:53.570 --> 00:06:54.403
<v Speaker 1>and half the town looks like a coloring </v>
<v Speaker 1>book page inspired by the day after </v>

126
00:06:57.890 --> 00:06:58.723
<v Speaker 1>tomorrow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But so ca ponyo manage to stave off the </v>

127
00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:01.933
<v Speaker 1>end of days by proving that humans can </v>
<v Speaker 1>love nature for itself in the most </v>

128
00:07:04.851 --> 00:07:05.684
<v Speaker 1>literal way possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>After helping so skate traverse the </v>

129
00:07:07.851 --> 00:07:08.684
<v Speaker 1>flooded island to get back to his mom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ponyo uses up all her magical power and </v>

130
00:07:12.081 --> 00:07:15.290
<v Speaker 1>returns to being a fish when asked by </v>
<v Speaker 1>pose mother,</v>

131
00:07:15.291 --> 00:07:17.930
<v Speaker 1>the spirit of the earth and goddess of </v>
<v Speaker 1>mercy herself.</v>

132
00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:20.420
<v Speaker 1>If so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ski knew that Ponyo was a fish and could</v>

133
00:07:20.421 --> 00:07:21.254
<v Speaker 1>love her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyway.</v>

134
00:07:21.350 --> 00:07:22.183
<v Speaker 1>He responds,</v>

135
00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:23.033
<v Speaker 4>I love</v>

136
00:07:24.070 --> 00:07:24.903
<v Speaker 1>so demonstrates that humans can </v>
<v Speaker 1>intrinsically value nature by actually </v>

137
00:07:28.521 --> 00:07:29.354
<v Speaker 1>falling in love with the fish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Relieved Ponyo his mother puts her </v>

138
00:07:31.851 --> 00:07:32.684
<v Speaker 1>daughter in a bubble and with a kiss </v>
<v Speaker 1>from so skate Ponyo transforms </v>

139
00:07:35.301 --> 00:07:39.470
<v Speaker 1>permanently into a real girl,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thereby putting the world at ease again,</v>

140
00:07:39.890 --> 00:07:40.723
<v Speaker 1>while Ponyo chooses to ground this </v>
<v Speaker 1>mismatch of values and a Romeo and </v>

141
00:07:43.491 --> 00:07:46.310
<v Speaker 1>Juliet sorta way more often than not in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Miyazaki films,</v>

142
00:07:46.311 --> 00:07:47.144
<v Speaker 1>we see it embodied in the conflict </v>
<v Speaker 1>between nature and technology and </v>

143
00:07:50.031 --> 00:07:50.864
<v Speaker 1>perhaps nowhere is this interplay more </v>
<v Speaker 1>noticeable than in me is Aki is darkest </v>

144
00:07:53.871 --> 00:07:54.950
<v Speaker 1>work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Princess modern.</v>

145
00:07:54.951 --> 00:07:56.300
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In the film prints,</v>

146
00:07:56.320 --> 00:07:57.153
<v Speaker 1>Asha Taka travel to the industrial </v>
<v Speaker 1>holdout irontown to understand what's </v>

147
00:08:00.381 --> 00:08:03.080
<v Speaker 1>causing the great spirits of the forest </v>
<v Speaker 1>to become cursed.</v>

148
00:08:03.350 --> 00:08:06.170
<v Speaker 1>As it turns out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>irontown under the leadership of Lady of</v>

149
00:08:06.171 --> 00:08:07.004
<v Speaker 1>OCI has been cutting down the forest in </v>
<v Speaker 1>order to bolster its own supply of iron </v>

150
00:08:10.940 --> 00:08:14.330
<v Speaker 1>in choosing their own material gain over</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sanctity of the forest.</v>

151
00:08:14.390 --> 00:08:15.223
<v Speaker 1>The residents of irontown have started </v>
<v Speaker 1>an all out war with the god of the </v>

152
00:08:18.201 --> 00:08:19.034
<v Speaker 1>mountain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a war which Asha Taka is determined to </v>

153
00:08:21.081 --> 00:08:21.914
<v Speaker 1>stop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's particularly interesting is how </v>

154
00:08:23.631 --> 00:08:24.464
<v Speaker 1>the townspeople viewed this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these four station in relation to the </v>

155
00:08:26.661 --> 00:08:29.540
<v Speaker 1>idea of progress before lady of Bocce </v>
<v Speaker 1>came along,</v>

156
00:08:29.541 --> 00:08:32.390
<v Speaker 1>they tell Asha Taka that it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>impossible to settle here.</v>

157
00:08:32.530 --> 00:08:34.870
<v Speaker 4>The problem was before we could dig for </v>
<v Speaker 4>the iron,</v>

158
00:08:34.900 --> 00:08:38.650
<v Speaker 4>we had to clear away the forest and </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's what made the board angry.</v>

159
00:08:43.970 --> 00:08:44.803
<v Speaker 2>Hello?</v>

160
00:08:52.540 --> 00:08:53.373
<v Speaker 1>Then one day the lady bull,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she came along with their warriors in </v>

161
00:08:55.421 --> 00:08:56.254
<v Speaker 1>the right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Awesome.</v>

162
00:08:57.760 --> 00:09:02.140
<v Speaker 1>This last point is important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The town's people view iron and guns and</v>

163
00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:03.033
<v Speaker 1>more broadly rationality as a vehicle </v>
<v Speaker 1>for progress with science and </v>

164
00:09:06.701 --> 00:09:07.534
<v Speaker 1>rationality on their side.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Humans think they can live anywhere and </v>

165
00:09:10.331 --> 00:09:11.164
<v Speaker 1>to anything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's exactly this mindset that </v>

166
00:09:13.451 --> 00:09:14.284
<v Speaker 1>philosophy's Ron Swanson.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Martin Heidegger says leads to a warped </v>

167
00:09:17.801 --> 00:09:18.634
<v Speaker 1>idea of reality because we're focused on</v>
<v Speaker 1>viewing nature only through the lens of </v>

168
00:09:22.451 --> 00:09:23.284
<v Speaker 1>science and technology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're blinded to the true essence of </v>

169
00:09:25.961 --> 00:09:27.940
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So trees become,</v>

170
00:09:27.941 --> 00:09:28.774
<v Speaker 1>would beaches become iron sand and a </v>
<v Speaker 1>giant walking God becomes a big pain in </v>

171
00:09:32.861 --> 00:09:35.320
<v Speaker 1>the ass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nothing is sacred anymore.</v>

172
00:09:35.470 --> 00:09:37.930
<v Speaker 1>And this is especially true to lady of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Boshi.</v>

173
00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:40.390
<v Speaker 1>She's not even afraid of that God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that woman.</v>

174
00:09:40.450 --> 00:09:41.283
<v Speaker 1>And while the forward march of </v>
<v Speaker 1>technology has brought some good to the </v>

175
00:09:43.430 --> 00:09:44.263
<v Speaker 1>townspeople,</v>
<v Speaker 1>empowering women and giving work to the </v>

176
00:09:46.121 --> 00:09:46.954
<v Speaker 1>literal lepers of society,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it also comes with some pretty big </v>

177
00:09:50.021 --> 00:09:52.240
<v Speaker 1>drawbacks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Namely angry wolves,</v>

178
00:09:52.241 --> 00:09:55.150
<v Speaker 1>bores monkeys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and some pretty nasty curses.</v>

179
00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:56.193
<v Speaker 1>So what's the overall takeaway here are </v>
<v Speaker 1>all of me is Auggie's films just thinly </v>

180
00:09:59.771 --> 00:10:03.160
<v Speaker 1>veiled odes to nature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's the message really as simple as</v>

181
00:10:03.161 --> 00:10:05.830
<v Speaker 1>trees are good in technology is bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

182
00:10:05.831 --> 00:10:08.470
<v Speaker 1>let's not go full thorough just yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>After all,</v>

183
00:10:08.500 --> 00:10:09.333
<v Speaker 1>nature can be pretty damn scary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And me as Aki films in the futuristic </v>

184
00:10:12.581 --> 00:10:15.820
<v Speaker 1>apocalyptic nightmare that is NASA,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Valley of the wind,</v>

185
00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:19.060
<v Speaker 1>the humans live in a world invaded by a </v>
<v Speaker 1>toxic jungle,</v>

186
00:10:21.180 --> 00:10:25.350
<v Speaker 5>told to believe these spores can kill me</v>
<v Speaker 5>without a mask.</v>

187
00:10:26.510 --> 00:10:27.343
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And did we mention these swarms of </v>

188
00:10:28.401 --> 00:10:30.770
<v Speaker 1>massive killer insects that live in it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Similarly,</v>

189
00:10:30.771 --> 00:10:31.604
<v Speaker 1>spirits aren't always your friend in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Miyazaki's most famous work spirited </v>

190
00:10:34.881 --> 00:10:35.714
<v Speaker 1>away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The little girl Chihiro enters a </v>

191
00:10:36.891 --> 00:10:37.724
<v Speaker 1>mysterious deserted town with her </v>
<v Speaker 1>parents only for them to be turned into </v>

192
00:10:40.551 --> 00:10:43.340
<v Speaker 1>pigs and you hero's quest to change her </v>
<v Speaker 1>parents back.</v>

193
00:10:43.430 --> 00:10:48.050
<v Speaker 1>Chanters a service of an evil witch you </v>
<v Speaker 1>Baba and runs into this unruly patron,</v>

194
00:10:48.051 --> 00:10:53.051
<v Speaker 1>no face.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

195
00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:55.630
<v Speaker 1>Not exactly a friendly figure like </v>
<v Speaker 1>Totoro,</v>

196
00:10:55.900 --> 00:10:58.840
<v Speaker 1>but if nature and spirits aren't always </v>
<v Speaker 1>good,</v>

197
00:10:58.900 --> 00:11:02.980
<v Speaker 1>then it stands to reason that society </v>
<v Speaker 1>and technology aren't always bad.</v>

198
00:11:03.250 --> 00:11:07.690
<v Speaker 1>Case and point in the wind rises </v>
<v Speaker 1>Miyazaki's last film technology is never</v>

199
00:11:07.691 --> 00:11:10.300
<v Speaker 1>presented as something to fear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

200
00:11:10.330 --> 00:11:11.163
<v Speaker 1>it's freak events of nature like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>massive earthquake and disease that </v>

201
00:11:14.591 --> 00:11:16.840
<v Speaker 1>creates a lot of the conflict in this </v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

202
00:11:17.020 --> 00:11:20.350
<v Speaker 1>As the protagonist juro learns in one of</v>
<v Speaker 1>his many dream sequences,</v>

203
00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:23.860
<v Speaker 1>airplanes for him aren't the same as </v>
<v Speaker 1>lady [inaudible] guns.</v>

204
00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:28.270
<v Speaker 1>They're not meant to do battle or to </v>
<v Speaker 1>further materialistic gains as his idol.</v>

205
00:11:28.271 --> 00:11:31.610
<v Speaker 1>Giovanni caproni states airplanes are </v>
<v Speaker 1>not tools for,</v>

206
00:11:32.070 --> 00:11:36.070
<v Speaker 1>they are not for making money and plains</v>
<v Speaker 1>are beautiful.</v>

207
00:11:36.071 --> 00:11:39.640
<v Speaker 1>To me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>engineer's turn dreams into reality.</v>

208
00:11:40.040 --> 00:11:42.380
<v Speaker 1>In the end,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what it all seems to come down to is the</v>

209
00:11:42.381 --> 00:11:47.300
<v Speaker 1>idea of respect and balance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In Shinto certain actions create a sense</v>

210
00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:48.193
<v Speaker 1>of ritual purity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They give peace of mind to your own </v>

211
00:11:50.571 --> 00:11:51.404
<v Speaker 1>spirit and those around you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the dead must be for their souls to be </v>

212
00:11:54.341 --> 00:11:55.174
<v Speaker 1>at peace.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Local gods and wildlife must be shown </v>

213
00:11:57.311 --> 00:12:02.080
<v Speaker 1>respect and their sacrifices even for </v>
<v Speaker 1>the benefit of mankind must be honored.</v>

214
00:12:02.410 --> 00:12:06.430
<v Speaker 1>If not these angered spirits can become </v>
<v Speaker 1>cursed or you know this.</v>

215
00:12:09.270 --> 00:12:10.103
<v Speaker 1>It's not a matter of land being good or </v>
<v Speaker 1>technology being bad so much as it is </v>

216
00:12:13.261 --> 00:12:17.430
<v Speaker 1>about living in harmony with the natural</v>
<v Speaker 1>world to hammer this point home.</v>

217
00:12:17.431 --> 00:12:19.920
<v Speaker 1>Let's have a quick look at castle in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>sky,</v>

218
00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:20.993
<v Speaker 1>which follows the young boy Pazo and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>princess sheet does quest to find the </v>

219
00:12:23.821 --> 00:12:27.480
<v Speaker 1>long lost flying city of La Pito.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As it turns out,</v>

220
00:12:27.540 --> 00:12:28.373
<v Speaker 1>she does ambulate points the way to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>city and with the help of some friendly </v>

221
00:12:30.841 --> 00:12:31.674
<v Speaker 1>air pirates,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the duo racist to reach Lapino before </v>

222
00:12:33.511 --> 00:12:36.030
<v Speaker 1>the military,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when the pair of finally arrived,</v>

223
00:12:36.031 --> 00:12:38.850
<v Speaker 1>the city's not what they expect in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>century.</v>

224
00:12:38.851 --> 00:12:42.930
<v Speaker 1>Since it's abandonment lop,</v>
<v Speaker 1>UTA has become overgrown with plants and</v>

225
00:12:42.931 --> 00:12:43.764
<v Speaker 1>those scary robots in the distance while</v>
<v Speaker 1>turns out they're more of the big </v>

226
00:12:46.261 --> 00:12:48.960
<v Speaker 1>friendly giant variety.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Instead of killing people,</v>

227
00:12:48.961 --> 00:12:52.320
<v Speaker 1>they tend to the wildlife and much like </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the Shinto tradition,</v>

228
00:12:52.321 --> 00:12:54.210
<v Speaker 1>they also pay their respects to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>debt.</v>

233
00:13:04.591 --> 00:13:05.424
<v Speaker 1>main crystal and power source.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's only when the army arrived and </v>

234
00:13:08.371 --> 00:13:09.204
<v Speaker 1>particularly Mooska that this status is </v>
<v Speaker 1>broken as Mooska violently ripped </v>

<v Speaker 1>through the vegetation that has taken </v>
<v Speaker 1>over Lapi does control room.</v>

<v Speaker 1>He attempts to turn the city into a </v>
<v Speaker 1>massive weapon watching goose because </v>

<v Speaker 1>of letting Musco break the balance of </v>

248
00:13:57.081 --> 00:13:59.990
<v Speaker 1>the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they destroy lapita all together.</v>

249
00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:04.100
<v Speaker 1>As the city crumbles though the tree and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the power source remain intact.</v>
