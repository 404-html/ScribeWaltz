00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:06.690
<v Speaker 1>Good evening,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my name is looking.</v>

2
00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:08.650
<v Speaker 1>My daughter and ever struggled,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ballsy,</v>

3
00:00:08.651 --> 00:00:11.170
<v Speaker 1>so I'm sorry if I sound weird or look </v>
<v Speaker 1>weird,</v>

4
00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:13.750
<v Speaker 1>but my question to you was on cold </v>
<v Speaker 1>fusion,</v>

5
00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:14.613
<v Speaker 1>was it something that actually had </v>
<v Speaker 1>married or was it something that the </v>

6
00:00:17.471 --> 00:00:18.304
<v Speaker 1>scientific community legitimately had </v>
<v Speaker 1>reasons for abandoning your thoughts </v>

7
00:00:22.571 --> 00:00:23.404
<v Speaker 1>please.</v>

8
00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:24.790
<v Speaker 2>Low key,</v>
<v Speaker 2>low key,</v>

9
00:00:24.791 --> 00:00:26.390
<v Speaker 2>low key.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't look that weird to us,</v>

10
00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:29.620
<v Speaker 2>sir.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He looked fine about cold fusion,</v>

11
00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:30.463
<v Speaker 2>so here was the idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a guy who really had the first </v>

12
00:00:33.171 --> 00:00:38.171
<v Speaker 2>patent on television was the mythic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This was really his name,</v>

13
00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:40.423
<v Speaker 2>Phylo Farnsworth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it is said he told people that he </v>

14
00:00:44.511 --> 00:00:45.344
<v Speaker 2>had the idea for television by plowing </v>
<v Speaker 2>his uncle's potato field as a as a kid </v>

15
00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:57.470
<v Speaker 2>and he looked at the way the the furrows</v>
<v Speaker 2>went across the field and inferred.</v>

16
00:00:57.471 --> 00:00:59.840
<v Speaker 2>That would be a way to make a moving </v>
<v Speaker 2>picture.</v>

17
00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:01.213
<v Speaker 2>That same guy got it in his head that he</v>
<v Speaker 2>could make neutrons do whatever he </v>

18
00:01:07.821 --> 00:01:08.654
<v Speaker 2>wanted,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like he had this one success and he got </v>

19
00:01:11.271 --> 00:01:12.104
<v Speaker 2>it in his head that he could influence </v>
<v Speaker 2>neutrons and he created a device which </v>

20
00:01:16.191 --> 00:01:17.024
<v Speaker 2>he called a phaser and that that word </v>
<v Speaker 2>has later been used to describe a </v>

21
00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:27.140
<v Speaker 2>rotating vectors in electrical and light</v>
<v Speaker 2>waves and a heatwaves.</v>

22
00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.551
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

23
00:01:28.551 --> 00:01:33.551
<v Speaker 2>this thing was going to enable neutrons </v>
<v Speaker 2>to fuse together at room temperature.</v>

24
00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:37.730
<v Speaker 2>He was not able to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean this.</v>

25
00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:40.730
<v Speaker 2>In order to do that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as far as we can tell right now,</v>

26
00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:46.300
<v Speaker 2>you need the gravity of a star,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which we have at our nearby star,</v>

27
00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.913
<v Speaker 2>the sun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And people have speculated that you </v>

28
00:01:51.171 --> 00:01:54.980
<v Speaker 2>could also contain fusion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not speculated that's an exaggerated,</v>

29
00:01:54.981 --> 00:01:59.060
<v Speaker 2>that's a I'm shortchanging us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People have shown that you could contain</v>

30
00:01:59.061 --> 00:02:01.790
<v Speaker 2>fusion in May,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a magnetic field,</v>

31
00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:03.530
<v Speaker 2>a very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very strong magnetic field,</v>

32
00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.863
<v Speaker 2>but no one has been able to build a </v>
<v Speaker 2>magnetic field powered by the fusion </v>

33
00:02:11.511 --> 00:02:12.344
<v Speaker 2>reaction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That makes the fusion reaction makes </v>

34
00:02:16.611 --> 00:02:17.444
<v Speaker 2>enough power to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to establish the magnetic field is </v>

35
00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:21.800
<v Speaker 2>strong enough to hold it so that </v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone,</v>

36
00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:22.753
<v Speaker 2>in my experience growing up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's always 40 years from now when this </v>

37
00:02:26.031 --> 00:02:27.650
<v Speaker 2>will be done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

38
00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:29.420
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>recently,</v>

39
00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:30.950
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an aircraft company,</v>

40
00:02:30.951 --> 00:02:34.370
<v Speaker 2>I guess it was Mcdonald Douglas claimed </v>
<v Speaker 2>or yeah,</v>

41
00:02:34.371 --> 00:02:35.204
<v Speaker 2>Mcdonald's claimed that they'd be able </v>
<v Speaker 2>to make fusion happen at room </v>

42
00:02:39.051 --> 00:02:39.500
<v Speaker 2>temperature.</v>

43
00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:44.300
<v Speaker 2>I'm very skeptical because they look at </v>
<v Speaker 2>what happens in nature with these stars,</v>

44
00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:49.660
<v Speaker 2>but it's so far cold fusion was a myth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now then about 25 years ago,</v>

45
00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:56.020
<v Speaker 2>1988,</v>
<v Speaker 2>1990 scientists at a,</v>

46
00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:59.180
<v Speaker 2>at a university in the State of Utah </v>
<v Speaker 2>here in the US,</v>

47
00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:02.290
<v Speaker 2>thought they had established cold </v>
<v Speaker 2>fusion,</v>

48
00:03:02.291 --> 00:03:03.124
<v Speaker 2>that they had established a magnetic </v>
<v Speaker 2>field powered by the energy of the </v>

49
00:03:06.641 --> 00:03:10.540
<v Speaker 2>fusion that would contain the reaction,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they didn't.</v>

50
00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:13.840
<v Speaker 2>They had the thermometer in the wrong </v>
<v Speaker 2>place on their lab equipment.</v>

51
00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:15.273
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

52
00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:16.373
<v Speaker 2>I cite this as an example of journalists</v>
<v Speaker 2>who were not scientifically literate </v>

53
00:03:22.331 --> 00:03:25.540
<v Speaker 2>enough to question this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This result was published.</v>

54
00:03:25.541 --> 00:03:29.320
<v Speaker 2>Results are announced result and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>just let the thing,</v>

55
00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:30.213
<v Speaker 2>the journalists let the things spiral </v>
<v Speaker 2>out of control to the point where the </v>

56
00:03:32.801 --> 00:03:37.570
<v Speaker 2>story to the point where somebody like </v>
<v Speaker 2>you 25 years later is asking essentially</v>

57
00:03:37.571 --> 00:03:40.760
<v Speaker 2>the same question,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can we have fusion at room temperature?</v>

58
00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:42.820
<v Speaker 2>So as far as we know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

59
00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:43.923
<v Speaker 2>However,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is reasonable that you will be alive </v>

60
00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:49.360
<v Speaker 2>when people really do figure it out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's exciting.</v>

61
00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:51.400
<v Speaker 2>It's a very.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a great question.</v>
