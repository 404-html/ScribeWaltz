00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:05.660
<v Speaker 1>There's been a lot of talk over the past</v>
<v Speaker 1>few years.</v>

2
00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:06.783
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and in some popular books about the </v>

3
00:00:07.671 --> 00:00:08.504
<v Speaker 1>power of intuition and how if we trust </v>
<v Speaker 1>that our intuitions or went with our </v>

4
00:00:11.631 --> 00:00:12.464
<v Speaker 1>guts more often,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we would actually wind up making better </v>

5
00:00:13.731 --> 00:00:16.280
<v Speaker 1>decisions in the world would even be a </v>
<v Speaker 1>better place.</v>

6
00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:17.383
<v Speaker 1>Some researchers have talked about how </v>
<v Speaker 1>our intuitions and the intuitive </v>

7
00:00:21.201 --> 00:00:22.034
<v Speaker 1>judgments we can make,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the snap judgements are actually </v>

8
00:00:23.391 --> 00:00:26.870
<v Speaker 1>accurate a lot of the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And a lot of that is true.</v>

9
00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:27.943
<v Speaker 1>But what we noticed when thinking about </v>
<v Speaker 1>our gorilla experiment and doing </v>

10
00:00:30.711 --> 00:00:31.544
<v Speaker 1>research for this book is that there's a</v>
<v Speaker 1>whole category of intuitions that are </v>

11
00:00:34.611 --> 00:00:37.760
<v Speaker 1>actually systematically wrong and in </v>
<v Speaker 1>very dangerous ways.</v>

12
00:00:37.761 --> 00:00:40.580
<v Speaker 1>And those are the intuitions we have </v>
<v Speaker 1>about how our own minds work.</v>

13
00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:41.683
<v Speaker 1>So the gorilla experiment shows that we </v>
<v Speaker 1>intuitively think that we pay attention </v>

14
00:00:44.871 --> 00:00:46.580
<v Speaker 1>to a notice much more than we actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>

15
00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:51.470
<v Speaker 1>And that can have tragic consequences if</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get into a car accident or at one of</v>

16
00:00:51.471 --> 00:00:52.304
<v Speaker 1>the examples in our book is a nuclear </v>
<v Speaker 1>submarine that surfaced right into a </v>

17
00:00:55.041 --> 00:00:55.874
<v Speaker 1>Japanese fishing boat because in part </v>
<v Speaker 1>the captain of the submarine looked up </v>

18
00:00:59.751 --> 00:01:00.584
<v Speaker 1>in the periscope,</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't see any boats around and surface </v>

19
00:01:03.391 --> 00:01:04.224
<v Speaker 1>right into one that he didn't see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was actually probably right in </v>

20
00:01:06.261 --> 00:01:07.094
<v Speaker 1>front of him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's a case where intuitively we </v>

21
00:01:09.051 --> 00:01:11.750
<v Speaker 1>think something and it can really get us</v>
<v Speaker 1>into big trouble.</v>

22
00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:12.673
<v Speaker 1>We realized as we were thinking about </v>
<v Speaker 1>the book and putting together the idea </v>

23
00:01:14.711 --> 00:01:17.360
<v Speaker 1>is that this category of intuitions is </v>
<v Speaker 1>very broad.</v>

24
00:01:17.361 --> 00:01:20.120
<v Speaker 1>It's not just about visual attention,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's also about memory.</v>

25
00:01:20.121 --> 00:01:23.000
<v Speaker 1>We think we remember things much more </v>
<v Speaker 1>accurately than we really do.</v>

26
00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:24.560
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's about confidence.</v>

27
00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:26.053
<v Speaker 1>We think that people who are confident </v>
<v Speaker 1>are also more skilled and accurate and </v>

28
00:01:29.361 --> 00:01:31.490
<v Speaker 1>knowledgeable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's about our own knowledge.</v>

29
00:01:31.491 --> 00:01:32.324
<v Speaker 1>We think that we know and understand </v>
<v Speaker 1>more about the world and we really do </v>

30
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.620
<v Speaker 1>and so on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're sort of like a whole sort of set</v>

31
00:01:36.621 --> 00:01:38.620
<v Speaker 1>of these intuitions which,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

32
00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:40.880
<v Speaker 1>can really lead us astray if we're not </v>
<v Speaker 1>aware of them.</v>

33
00:01:40.881 --> 00:01:42.470
<v Speaker 1>And that's what we decided to write the </v>
<v Speaker 1>book about.</v>

34
00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:47.103
<v Speaker 1>We are in a way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>taking on the impression that a lot of </v>

35
00:01:49.151 --> 00:01:49.984
<v Speaker 1>people have from books like blink by </v>
<v Speaker 1>Malcolm Gladwell and others in that </v>

36
00:01:54.131 --> 00:01:56.980
<v Speaker 1>category,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is sort of an uncritical belief in</v>

37
00:01:56.981 --> 00:01:59.380
<v Speaker 1>the power of intuition and snap </v>
<v Speaker 1>judgments and so on.</v>

38
00:01:59.381 --> 00:02:00.590
<v Speaker 1>And the idea that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

39
00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:02.410
<v Speaker 1>you should rely on them whenever </v>
<v Speaker 1>possible.</v>

40
00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:04.060
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we sort of are,</v>

41
00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:05.013
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a sense taking on the cult of </v>

42
00:02:06.201 --> 00:02:08.650
<v Speaker 1>intuition or the myth of intuition as we</v>
<v Speaker 1>call it in the book.</v>

43
00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:09.723
<v Speaker 1>I should also say that we're very </v>
<v Speaker 1>pleased at Malcolm gladwell actually </v>

44
00:02:11.921 --> 00:02:12.754
<v Speaker 1>read our original scientific journal </v>
<v Speaker 1>Article about the invisible gorilla </v>

45
00:02:15.881 --> 00:02:18.340
<v Speaker 1>study and talked about it and one of his</v>
<v Speaker 1>New Yorker articles,</v>

46
00:02:18.341 --> 00:02:19.174
<v Speaker 1>which helped it get more publicity and </v>
<v Speaker 1>ultimately led to it becoming more </v>

47
00:02:21.881 --> 00:02:23.220
<v Speaker 1>widely known,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

48
00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:24.580
<v Speaker 1>and as famous as it is.</v>
