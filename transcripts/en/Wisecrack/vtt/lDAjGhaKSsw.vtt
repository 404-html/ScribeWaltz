<v Speaker 1>This video is sponsored by Oculus rift.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey guys,</v>

2
00:00:07.891 --> 00:00:09.630
<v Speaker 1>Helen here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Full disclosure,</v>

3
00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.090
<v Speaker 1>Oculus came to us and said they were </v>
<v Speaker 1>fans of our work,</v>

4
00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:12.983
<v Speaker 1>which was one really flattering and two </v>
<v Speaker 1>really awesome because you know jared </v>

5
00:00:17.131 --> 00:00:19.980
<v Speaker 1>and I love that new tech.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>

6
00:00:19.981 --> 00:00:20.814
<v Speaker 1>they asked if we had anything smart to </v>
<v Speaker 1>say about Vr and Vr has been in the </v>

7
00:00:23.851 --> 00:00:27.430
<v Speaker 1>media a ton lately from the rise of </v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] and Nma,</v>

8
00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.470
<v Speaker 1>like sword art online and overlord,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who smash hits like ready player one.</v>

9
00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:32.573
<v Speaker 1>We got pretty excited.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even rick and morty uses vr for one of </v>

10
00:00:34.831 --> 00:00:36.570
<v Speaker 1>our favorite gags.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Roy,</v>

11
00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:40.640
<v Speaker 2>you're not bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Morty.</v>

12
00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:43.920
<v Speaker 2>Kind of wasted your thirties though with</v>
<v Speaker 2>that whole birdwatching faith.</v>

13
00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:46.010
<v Speaker 2>Where's my wife?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You were just playing a game.</v>

14
00:00:46.011 --> 00:00:47.450
<v Speaker 2>It's called Roy snap out of it.</v>

15
00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.310
<v Speaker 1>Now I know we hear it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wise crack can get pretty tech,</v>

16
00:00:50.311 --> 00:00:51.144
<v Speaker 1>the phobic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we wanted to try out this thing </v>

17
00:00:52.891 --> 00:00:56.280
<v Speaker 1>called optimism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If science fiction is any indication the</v>

18
00:00:56.281 --> 00:00:58.530
<v Speaker 1>mass exodus to virtual worlds is </v>
<v Speaker 1>inevitable,</v>

19
00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:00.750
<v Speaker 1>but instead of jumping on the prophecy </v>
<v Speaker 1>train,</v>

20
00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:01.733
<v Speaker 1>we're going to talk about some of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>philosophical ramifications of the art </v>

21
00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.680
<v Speaker 1>technology and how it can revolutionize </v>
<v Speaker 1>storytelling and perspective,</v>

22
00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.850
<v Speaker 1>and while we could view Vr as just </v>
<v Speaker 1>another step in technology like the jump</v>

23
00:01:11.851 --> 00:01:14.670
<v Speaker 1>from radio to film,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there seems to be something more to it.</v>

24
00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:15.653
<v Speaker 1>That's something we think is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>philosophical concept called Kuala </v>

25
00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.680
<v Speaker 1>welcome to this wise crack addition on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the philosophy of Vr and yeah.</v>

26
00:01:22.681 --> 00:01:24.030
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No spoilers ahead,</v>

27
00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:25.493
<v Speaker 1>but before we get into quality out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we should say something about </v>

28
00:01:27.271 --> 00:01:28.104
<v Speaker 1>storytelling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are a million reasons why someone </v>

29
00:01:30.091 --> 00:01:30.924
<v Speaker 1>would tell a story the muses told you to</v>
<v Speaker 1>or the absence told you to or the </v>

30
00:01:35.221 --> 00:01:36.054
<v Speaker 1>amphetamines told you to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but at the core of every story is a </v>

31
00:01:38.941 --> 00:01:42.060
<v Speaker 1>single ask to inhabit a character's </v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective.</v>

32
00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.910
<v Speaker 1>Roald Dahl,</v>
<v Speaker 1>author of everyone's favorite book about</v>

33
00:01:44.911 --> 00:01:48.900
<v Speaker 1>a greedy CEO exploiting immigrant labor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>said it best in Matilda.</v>

34
00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:49.823
<v Speaker 1>The books transported Matilda into new </v>
<v Speaker 1>worlds and introduced her to amazing </v>

35
00:01:53.011 --> 00:01:55.900
<v Speaker 1>people who live exciting lives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She went on olden days,</v>

36
00:01:55.901 --> 00:01:59.580
<v Speaker 1>sailing ships with Joseph Conrad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She went to Africa with Ernest Hemingway</v>

37
00:01:59.581 --> 00:02:00.414
<v Speaker 1>and to India with Rudy kipling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She traveled all over the world while </v>

38
00:02:02.821 --> 00:02:03.654
<v Speaker 1>sitting in her little room in an English</v>
<v Speaker 1>village by allowing us to inhabit the </v>

39
00:02:06.601 --> 00:02:07.434
<v Speaker 1>mind and body of its characters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Storytelling can challenge our </v>

40
00:02:09.541 --> 00:02:10.374
<v Speaker 1>perspective and change our views,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but as amazing as these stories are </v>

41
00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.690
<v Speaker 1>traditional mediums like literature and </v>
<v Speaker 1>film,</v>

42
00:02:15.691 --> 00:02:19.020
<v Speaker 1>stop a little short when it comes to </v>
<v Speaker 1>inhabiting the perspective,</v>

43
00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:21.210
<v Speaker 1>whether we're living vicariously through</v>
<v Speaker 1>Frodo,</v>

44
00:02:21.211 --> 00:02:22.044
<v Speaker 1>delivering the ring to more door or the </v>
<v Speaker 1>dude just trying to get his rug back on </v>

45
00:02:25.691 --> 00:02:26.524
<v Speaker 1>your feet and lift.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're always reminded of the space </v>

46
00:02:29.401 --> 00:02:31.050
<v Speaker 1>between us and the characters.</v>

47
00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:32.550
<v Speaker 1>John Gardner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in his book,</v>

48
00:02:32.551 --> 00:02:33.384
<v Speaker 1>the art of fiction calls this concept </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychic distance or basically how deep </v>

49
00:02:37.201 --> 00:02:38.034
<v Speaker 1>we are in the character's head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the difference between reading the </v>

50
00:02:40.051 --> 00:02:40.884
<v Speaker 1>sentence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He walked to the store and he ambled to </v>

51
00:02:43.471 --> 00:02:46.020
<v Speaker 1>the store.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wild thoughts racing on his mind.</v>

52
00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:50.700
<v Speaker 1>The latter example brings us closer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but regardless of how the story is told,</v>

53
00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:51.773
<v Speaker 1>we can never collapsed the psychic </v>
<v Speaker 1>distance to zero while staring at the </v>

54
00:02:54.391 --> 00:02:55.224
<v Speaker 1>pages.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In a book or a TV on the wall will </v>

55
00:02:57.241 --> 00:03:00.250
<v Speaker 1>inevitably notice that these thoughts </v>
<v Speaker 1>and aren't our own,</v>

56
00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:01.173
<v Speaker 1>and as it turns out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a good philosophical reason why </v>

57
00:03:03.401 --> 00:03:08.401
<v Speaker 1>this distance can never be fully closed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This concept called Kuala in philosophy.</v>

58
00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:12.070
<v Speaker 1>Quality is the idea that mental states </v>
<v Speaker 1>like perception,</v>

59
00:03:12.071 --> 00:03:13.270
<v Speaker 1>sensations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thoughts,</v>

60
00:03:13.271 --> 00:03:16.900
<v Speaker 1>and emotions all have a certain </v>
<v Speaker 1>subjective feeling to them.</v>

61
00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:19.210
<v Speaker 1>When you sip wine or stare at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>sunset,</v>

62
00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:22.540
<v Speaker 1>these experiences are all unique to you </v>
<v Speaker 1>in that moment.</v>

63
00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:26.500
<v Speaker 1>The key word here is unique.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your friend could do all the same things</v>

64
00:03:26.501 --> 00:03:27.334
<v Speaker 1>and still have a different experience </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you wouldn't ever be able to really </v>

65
00:03:30.461 --> 00:03:34.180
<v Speaker 1>explain this difference either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As philosopher Thomas Nagel explained in</v>

66
00:03:34.181 --> 00:03:36.010
<v Speaker 1>his paper,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is it like to be a bat?</v>

67
00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:38.500
<v Speaker 1>We could know everything there is to </v>
<v Speaker 1>know about that,</v>

68
00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:39.363
<v Speaker 1>but that doesn't translate to knowing </v>
<v Speaker 1>what it's like to be flapping about and </v>

69
00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:42.543
<v Speaker 1>navigating via sound.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's the weird thing about this </v>

70
00:03:44.201 --> 00:03:45.034
<v Speaker 1>whole quality of debate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's an explanatory gap between </v>

71
00:03:47.351 --> 00:03:48.184
<v Speaker 1>knowledge and experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One that has some pretty big </v>

72
00:03:50.201 --> 00:03:51.034
<v Speaker 1>philosophical and everyday consequences </v>
<v Speaker 1>for philosophers who believed that the </v>

73
00:03:54.101 --> 00:03:56.290
<v Speaker 1>world can be explained by laws and </v>
<v Speaker 1>science.</v>

74
00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:57.333
<v Speaker 1>They now have to explain this new type </v>
<v Speaker 1>of knowledge seemingly unrelated to </v>

75
00:04:00.161 --> 00:04:04.210
<v Speaker 1>facts and for everyone else,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're doomed to tell funny stories about</v>

76
00:04:04.211 --> 00:04:05.920
<v Speaker 1>things that happened,</v>
<v Speaker 1>failed,</v>

77
00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:07.690
<v Speaker 1>and then fall back on the old.</v>

78
00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:08.613
<v Speaker 1>You should have been their defense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The big takeaway is that this gap </v>

79
00:04:11.021 --> 00:04:15.370
<v Speaker 1>between knowledge and experience is real</v>
<v Speaker 1>and no matter how many words we write on</v>

80
00:04:15.371 --> 00:04:18.310
<v Speaker 1>a page or how many flashing images we </v>
<v Speaker 1>have on the screen,</v>

81
00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:22.180
<v Speaker 1>we can never bridge that well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe not never.</v>

82
00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:24.850
<v Speaker 1>So what does that have to do with Vr?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

83
00:04:24.851 --> 00:04:29.851
<v Speaker 1>the reason why Vr is so groundbreaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or in Marty's case mind bending morty,</v>

84
00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:31.363
<v Speaker 1>you're rick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is because vr gets us infinitely closer </v>

85
00:04:33.611 --> 00:04:37.150
<v Speaker 1>to bridging that gap.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unlike reading a book or watching TV,</v>

86
00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:38.223
<v Speaker 1>Vr is an embodied experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're right there in the story </v>

87
00:04:40.871 --> 00:04:43.420
<v Speaker 1>sometimes inhabiting the body of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>favorite characters.</v>

88
00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:46.840
<v Speaker 1>This not only drastically reduces the </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychic distance gardener talked about,</v>

89
00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:49.360
<v Speaker 1>but it also deals with the pesky quality</v>
<v Speaker 1>of problem.</v>

90
00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:52.450
<v Speaker 1>Can't adequately explain how great your </v>
<v Speaker 1>vacation was to your friends.</v>

91
00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:53.373
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let them experience it themselves by </v>

92
00:04:54.371 --> 00:04:57.670
<v Speaker 1>throwing a headset on them and we can't </v>
<v Speaker 1>emphasize this enough.</v>

93
00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:01.720
<v Speaker 1>The difference between knowing something</v>
<v Speaker 1>and experiencing something is huge.</v>

94
00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:04.960
<v Speaker 1>It's why you can feel somewhat safe </v>
<v Speaker 1>watching the ring on tv,</v>

95
00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:06.273
<v Speaker 1>but grab your pants,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the threesixty experience combined vr </v>

96
00:05:08.951 --> 00:05:09.784
<v Speaker 1>with haptic feedback and full body </v>
<v Speaker 1>motion tracking and you can easily be </v>

97
00:05:12.731 --> 00:05:14.920
<v Speaker 1>fully immersed for hours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

98
00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:16.990
<v Speaker 1>before we move on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as I mentioned,</v>

99
00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:17.853
<v Speaker 1>this video is sponsored by Oculus rift.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're looking to dive into new </v>

100
00:05:20.351 --> 00:05:22.540
<v Speaker 1>worlds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's available for only three 99.</v>

101
00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:26.140
<v Speaker 1>If you've ever wanted to be a rage </v>
<v Speaker 1>filled green giant or a sas field,</v>

102
00:05:26.141 --> 00:05:26.974
<v Speaker 1>trash panda,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can save the world and marvel </v>

103
00:05:28.391 --> 00:05:29.650
<v Speaker 1>powers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>United Vr,</v>

104
00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:33.190
<v Speaker 1>or if you've ever wanted to get your </v>
<v Speaker 1>tabletop strategy game on and don't have</v>

105
00:05:33.191 --> 00:05:35.350
<v Speaker 1>hundreds of hours to build Internet </v>
<v Speaker 1>landscapes.</v>

106
00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:37.870
<v Speaker 1>There's brass tactics which looks so </v>
<v Speaker 1>cool.</v>

107
00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:42.340
<v Speaker 1>There's also the story driven Lone Echo </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the robotic mayhem of echo arena and</v>

108
00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:45.520
<v Speaker 1>there are all exclusive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you want to see me try out the oculus</v>

109
00:05:45.521 --> 00:05:47.830
<v Speaker 1>rift for myself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stick around till the end of the video.</v>

110
00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:49.600
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>back to the philosophy.</v>

111
00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:51.430
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know what you're thinking,</v>

112
00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:52.383
<v Speaker 1>Helen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even a vr allows you to sit behind the </v>

113
00:05:54.101 --> 00:05:54.934
<v Speaker 1>eyes of your favorite characters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That experience is still subjective and </v>

114
00:05:57.621 --> 00:05:58.454
<v Speaker 1>unique to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Multiple friends could watch the same </v>

115
00:06:00.291 --> 00:06:01.124
<v Speaker 1>three 60 film or play the same vr game </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they would still all have different </v>

116
00:06:04.101 --> 00:06:04.934
<v Speaker 1>experiences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We haven't fully bridged quality as </v>

117
00:06:07.101 --> 00:06:10.760
<v Speaker 1>explanatory gap and while that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>definitely true,</v>

118
00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:14.150
<v Speaker 1>vr actively tries to combat this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At comic con,</v>

119
00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:17.360
<v Speaker 1>we caught up with Ian Forester,</v>
<v Speaker 1>CEO of Vr playhouse,</v>

120
00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:20.150
<v Speaker 1>who's team had just created a vr </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience for the show.</v>

121
00:06:20.151 --> 00:06:22.970
<v Speaker 1>Mr Mercedes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when asked about the explanatory gap,</v>

122
00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:23.893
<v Speaker 1>he told us how good vr tries to bridge </v>
<v Speaker 1>it and trying to create a fully </v>

123
00:06:26.961 --> 00:06:27.794
<v Speaker 1>immersive experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There needs to be a palate cleanser </v>

124
00:06:29.841 --> 00:06:32.420
<v Speaker 1>almost.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's what we refer to as onboarding.</v>

125
00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:34.400
<v Speaker 1>You are you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We get that,</v>

126
00:06:34.401 --> 00:06:35.234
<v Speaker 1>but now you're going to assume a </v>
<v Speaker 1>different role and different </v>

127
00:06:37.071 --> 00:06:37.904
<v Speaker 1>circumstance.</v>

128
00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:41.300
<v Speaker 1>Onboarding is essentially a tutorial </v>
<v Speaker 1>section in a vr experience.</v>

129
00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:42.193
<v Speaker 1>It tells you about the character you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>inhabiting and how to interact with the </v>

130
00:06:44.541 --> 00:06:46.520
<v Speaker 1>vr world around you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In doing so,</v>

131
00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:51.350
<v Speaker 1>onboarding combats the explanatory gap </v>
<v Speaker 1>by asking you to forget well yourself.</v>

132
00:06:51.890 --> 00:06:54.530
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of like the suspension of </v>
<v Speaker 1>disbelief in theater,</v>

133
00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:57.260
<v Speaker 1>except instead of asking us to forget </v>
<v Speaker 1>the stage,</v>

134
00:06:57.261 --> 00:06:59.510
<v Speaker 1>the curtains,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the not very convincing set,</v>

135
00:06:59.810 --> 00:07:02.660
<v Speaker 1>it's asking us to forget our actual </v>
<v Speaker 1>selves,</v>

136
00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:03.553
<v Speaker 1>so how effectively can vr bridge quality</v>
<v Speaker 1>as explanatory gap stripping us of us </v>

137
00:07:07.431 --> 00:07:11.900
<v Speaker 1>and making us assume a new identity?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The short answer is pretty damn well.</v>

138
00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:14.930
<v Speaker 1>Recent studies have shown some science </v>
<v Speaker 1>fiction level results.</v>

139
00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:15.793
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in one study when white subjects </v>

140
00:07:17.271 --> 00:07:18.104
<v Speaker 1>inhabited a black virtual Avatar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they actually exhibit noticeably less </v>

141
00:07:21.381 --> 00:07:22.214
<v Speaker 1>racial bias than those who didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In another experiment when adults were </v>

142
00:07:24.801 --> 00:07:25.634
<v Speaker 1>placed in a virtual child's body,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they started exhibiting more childlike </v>

143
00:07:28.310 --> 00:07:29.143
<v Speaker 1>behaviors.</v>

144
00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:31.250
<v Speaker 1>According to philosopher Frederick David</v>
<v Speaker 1>Moan,</v>

145
00:07:31.430 --> 00:07:34.670
<v Speaker 1>our sense of self is deeply entangled </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the body we inhabit,</v>

146
00:07:35.030 --> 00:07:35.863
<v Speaker 1>partly because our body is the only </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing we both perceived and perceive </v>

147
00:07:39.111 --> 00:07:41.000
<v Speaker 1>width.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a bit like acting.</v>

148
00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:44.330
<v Speaker 1>We notice our costume and we start </v>
<v Speaker 1>adjusting our attitudes accordingly,</v>

149
00:07:44.570 --> 00:07:45.403
<v Speaker 1>and while we might not fully be able to </v>
<v Speaker 1>know 100 percent was like to be another </v>

150
00:07:48.471 --> 00:07:50.600
<v Speaker 1>person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>vr can get as close.</v>

151
00:07:50.750 --> 00:07:51.583
<v Speaker 1>It's exactly vrs ability to almost </v>
<v Speaker 1>inhabit other subjective experiences </v>

152
00:07:55.460 --> 00:07:57.590
<v Speaker 1>that makes it right for new therapy </v>
<v Speaker 1>techniques.</v>

153
00:07:57.650 --> 00:07:58.191
<v Speaker 1>Freud,</v>
<v Speaker 1>me,</v>

154
00:07:58.191 --> 00:07:59.024
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>puts patients in a motion capture suit </v>

155
00:08:01.220 --> 00:08:03.410
<v Speaker 1>and a Vr headset.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When the program starts,</v>

156
00:08:03.590 --> 00:08:08.590
<v Speaker 1>patients find themselves in a vr replica</v>
<v Speaker 1>of their own body moving exactly in sync</v>

157
00:08:08.691 --> 00:08:09.524
<v Speaker 1>with their real life body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They then tell a silent Dr Freud across </v>

158
00:08:11.901 --> 00:08:14.540
<v Speaker 1>the room about their problems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>After they're done,</v>

159
00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:15.553
<v Speaker 1>users then inhabit the body of Dr Freud </v>
<v Speaker 1>and hear their own problems from this </v>

160
00:08:19.220 --> 00:08:23.630
<v Speaker 1>outside perspective before offering </v>
<v Speaker 1>solutions to themselves.</v>

161
00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:27.950
<v Speaker 1>The results are pretty crazy with </v>
<v Speaker 1>patients reportedly experiencing greatly</v>

162
00:08:27.951 --> 00:08:30.380
<v Speaker 1>improved moves after undergoing the art </v>
<v Speaker 1>therapy,</v>

163
00:08:30.650 --> 00:08:34.160
<v Speaker 1>all because patients were able to step </v>
<v Speaker 1>outside of their own bodies,</v>

164
00:08:34.730 --> 00:08:35.563
<v Speaker 1>and it's not just virtual chitchats with</v>
<v Speaker 1>Freud that are seeing great results in </v>

165
00:08:38.121 --> 00:08:38.954
<v Speaker 1>Vr therapy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Things like exposure therapy or helping </v>

166
00:08:41.571 --> 00:08:45.530
<v Speaker 1>patients conquer certain fears and </v>
<v Speaker 1>phobias by facing them have huge success</v>

167
00:08:45.531 --> 00:08:47.240
<v Speaker 1>rates in Vr.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In one study,</v>

168
00:08:47.390 --> 00:08:48.223
<v Speaker 1>vr exposure therapy had over a 90 </v>
<v Speaker 1>percent success rate in treating the </v>

169
00:08:51.261 --> 00:08:54.290
<v Speaker 1>fear of flying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which seems better than the popular pop,</v>

170
00:08:54.291 --> 00:08:56.460
<v Speaker 1>a Xanax and downed a bottle of wine </v>
<v Speaker 1>approach,</v>

171
00:08:56.610 --> 00:08:59.010
<v Speaker 1>but buckling patients into a new </v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective,</v>

172
00:08:59.250 --> 00:09:01.560
<v Speaker 1>it gives them a safer way to face their </v>
<v Speaker 1>fears.</v>

173
00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:02.573
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some might consider vr a form of escape </v>

174
00:09:04.021 --> 00:09:04.854
<v Speaker 1>from reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can also see how it can give us an </v>

175
00:09:06.901 --> 00:09:10.320
<v Speaker 1>entirely new perspective on the very not</v>
<v Speaker 1>fictional world.</v>

176
00:09:10.530 --> 00:09:12.420
<v Speaker 1>So what does the future of Vr hold?</v>

177
00:09:12.510 --> 00:09:13.343
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we may be a long way off from a full </v>

178
00:09:14.521 --> 00:09:15.354
<v Speaker 1>ready player one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but with computers getting stronger and </v>

179
00:09:17.311 --> 00:09:19.830
<v Speaker 1>wireless headsets coming out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're making progress.</v>

180
00:09:19.980 --> 00:09:20.813
<v Speaker 1>And while we as a society sometimes </v>
<v Speaker 1>indulgent fearmongering about future </v>

181
00:09:23.941 --> 00:09:24.774
<v Speaker 1>tech from skynet Matrix,</v>
<v Speaker 1>vr has the potential to make a really </v>

182
00:09:28.411 --> 00:09:31.320
<v Speaker 1>positive impact.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you know there are guys who actually</v>

183
00:09:31.321 --> 00:09:32.154
<v Speaker 1>lug heavy threesixty cameras around </v>
<v Speaker 1>mountain trails and just so people who </v>

184
00:09:34.711 --> 00:09:37.980
<v Speaker 1>can't hike them can still experience </v>
<v Speaker 1>them and yeah,</v>

185
00:09:37.981 --> 00:09:40.770
<v Speaker 1>we might be scared of creating some </v>
<v Speaker 1>ready player.</v>

186
00:09:40.771 --> 00:09:43.440
<v Speaker 1>One escape is nightmare,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a social philosopher,</v>

187
00:09:43.441 --> 00:09:44.274
<v Speaker 1>Ernst Bloch argued daydreaming and </v>
<v Speaker 1>escapism actually can positively </v>

188
00:09:47.101 --> 00:09:47.934
<v Speaker 1>influence society by exploring the </v>
<v Speaker 1>possibilities of how things could be </v>

189
00:09:50.611 --> 00:09:51.444
<v Speaker 1>different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We engaged in an immature but honest </v>

190
00:09:53.371 --> 00:09:54.204
<v Speaker 1>substitute for revolution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one that can bring about machine to </v>

191
00:09:56.511 --> 00:09:58.300
<v Speaker 1>change the society today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

192
00:09:58.590 --> 00:10:01.170
<v Speaker 1>I want to check out this oculus rift and</v>
<v Speaker 1>see what it's all about.</v>

193
00:10:01.530 --> 00:10:04.620
<v Speaker 1>I also just want to say that without </v>
<v Speaker 1>sponsors like oculus rift,</v>

194
00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:06.690
<v Speaker 1>many of our episodes wouldn't even be </v>
<v Speaker 1>possible,</v>

195
00:10:06.780 --> 00:10:09.690
<v Speaker 1>so thanks guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now where's my headset out?</v>

196
00:10:11.130 --> 00:10:11.963
<v Speaker 1>Let's do this.</v>

197
00:10:16.680 --> 00:10:21.680
<v Speaker 3>Here we go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Alright,</v>

198
