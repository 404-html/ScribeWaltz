<v Speaker 1>This video is sponsored by skillshare.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stick around to find out how you can get</v>

2
00:00:03.011 --> 00:00:08.011
<v Speaker 1>three months of skillshare for just </v>
<v Speaker 1>ninety nine cents a wise crack.</v>

3
00:00:09.281 --> 00:00:11.140
<v Speaker 1>Jared here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it may be the new year,</v>

4
00:00:11.141 --> 00:00:15.520
<v Speaker 1>but we've still got a massive hangover </v>
<v Speaker 1>from 2017 final blockbuster,</v>

5
00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:16.543
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>A film that left us cross eyed and </v>

6
00:00:18.341 --> 00:00:20.560
<v Speaker 1>confused.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Netflix spent $90,</v>

7
00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:22.810
<v Speaker 1>million dollars combining two of our </v>
<v Speaker 1>favorite things,</v>

8
00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:23.703
<v Speaker 1>the dystopian fantasy and the buddy cop </v>
<v Speaker 1>and left us with the world's most </v>

9
00:00:27.251 --> 00:00:28.084
<v Speaker 1>expensive WTF.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've been scratching our heads trying </v>

10
00:00:30.941 --> 00:00:33.400
<v Speaker 1>to figure out how such an awesome </v>
<v Speaker 1>concept.</v>

11
00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:34.263
<v Speaker 1>Think rush hour too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If the deathly hallows or lethal weapon </v>

12
00:00:36.371 --> 00:00:40.630
<v Speaker 1>of the rings ended up feeling as biggest</v>
<v Speaker 1>show as David Ayers last movie.</v>

13
00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:41.770
<v Speaker 1>Sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't help it.</v>

14
00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:42.783
<v Speaker 1>Like other fantasy films,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems to be using it's imaginary </v>

15
00:00:45.221 --> 00:00:46.054
<v Speaker 1>setting to tell a compelling story while</v>
<v Speaker 1>also illuminating truths about our </v>

16
00:00:49.301 --> 00:00:50.680
<v Speaker 1>society.</v>
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

17
00:00:50.681 --> 00:00:51.514
<v Speaker 1>both its plot and any potential </v>
<v Speaker 1>underlying meaning become completely </v>

18
00:00:54.761 --> 00:00:55.840
<v Speaker 1>muddled by the films.</v>

19
00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:56.673
<v Speaker 1>Poor world-building,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lousy character development and ill </v>

20
00:00:59.081 --> 00:01:01.450
<v Speaker 1>suited metaphors about American racial </v>
<v Speaker 1>politics.</v>

21
00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:04.810
<v Speaker 1>So let's find out what happened in this </v>
<v Speaker 1>week's [inaudible] condition on bright,</v>

22
00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:06.850
<v Speaker 1>what went wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if you liked this sort of thing,</v>

23
00:01:06.851 --> 00:01:09.160
<v Speaker 1>there's more where this came from in our</v>
<v Speaker 1>movie podcast.</v>

24
00:01:09.161 --> 00:01:11.130
<v Speaker 1>Show me the meaning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>links in the description,</v>

25
00:01:11.131 --> 00:01:13.090
<v Speaker 1>and be sure to check it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And as always,</v>

26
00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:13.953
<v Speaker 1>major,</v>
<v Speaker 1>minor and vaguely judgmental spoilers </v>

27
00:01:16.061 --> 00:01:18.490
<v Speaker 1>ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Headscratcher number one,</v>

28
00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:21.070
<v Speaker 1>building the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every time you see a film,</v>

29
00:01:21.071 --> 00:01:21.904
<v Speaker 1>you're asked to take a leap of faith and</v>
<v Speaker 1>accept some kind of proposition that </v>

30
00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:26.103
<v Speaker 1>loving parents occasionally leave their </v>
<v Speaker 1>youngest child behind when they go on </v>

31
00:01:28.511 --> 00:01:32.380
<v Speaker 1>vacation or that Keanu reeves is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>most bad ass assassin ever.</v>

32
00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:35.560
<v Speaker 1>But when you're watching a fantasy that </v>
<v Speaker 1>plays with gravity,</v>

33
00:01:35.561 --> 00:01:38.980
<v Speaker 1>object permanence or the entertainment </v>
<v Speaker 1>potential of a piece of furniture,</v>

34
00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:39.873
<v Speaker 1>filmmakers have to convince you to take </v>
<v Speaker 1>a mountain everest size leap off a peak </v>

35
00:01:43.121 --> 00:01:46.600
<v Speaker 1>of disbelief and land with their </v>
<v Speaker 1>characters in a distant galaxy,</v>

36
00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:49.870
<v Speaker 1>middle earth or a far away distant land </v>
<v Speaker 1>inside a wardrobe.</v>

37
00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:50.913
<v Speaker 1>A good script gets the audience to buy </v>
<v Speaker 1>into its world by explaining the rules </v>

38
00:01:53.921 --> 00:01:58.330
<v Speaker 1>of that world coherently and concisely </v>
<v Speaker 1>and getting the heck on with the story.</v>

39
00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:59.313
<v Speaker 1>Think of how effective Lord of the rings</v>
<v Speaker 1>is in briefing the audience on the </v>

40
00:02:01.541 --> 00:02:04.120
<v Speaker 1>history of middle Earth's most sought </v>
<v Speaker 1>after jewelry</v>

41
00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:09.300
<v Speaker 2>with the forging of the great rings.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Three were given to the elks,</v>

42
00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:12.450
<v Speaker 2>seven to the dwarf loads,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and nine,</v>

43
00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:15.750
<v Speaker 2>nine rings were gifted to the race of </v>
<v Speaker 2>men,</v>

44
00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.973
<v Speaker 2>but they will,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of them to see for another ring was </v>

45
00:02:20.851 --> 00:02:24.630
<v Speaker 2>made.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm mastering to control all others.</v>

46
00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.610
<v Speaker 2>One ring to rule them all</v>

47
00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:30.190
<v Speaker 1>with an origin story clocking in at six </v>
<v Speaker 1>minutes.</v>

48
00:02:30.191 --> 00:02:31.024
<v Speaker 1>That film situates US firmly in this </v>
<v Speaker 1>complex world for it even leaner </v>

49
00:02:34.071 --> 00:02:34.904
<v Speaker 1>example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>consider star wars epic rolling title </v>

50
00:02:36.501 --> 00:02:37.334
<v Speaker 1>card that introduces you to an </v>
<v Speaker 1>intergalactic space war in the time it </v>

51
00:02:39.981 --> 00:02:40.814
<v Speaker 1>takes to unwrap a candy bar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Both films Orient the audience quickly </v>

52
00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:46.400
<v Speaker 1>and then they're off to the races.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brights,</v>

53
00:02:46.401 --> 00:02:47.930
<v Speaker 1>origin story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On the other hand,</v>

54
00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:50.810
<v Speaker 1>it's just plain messy to voltage and </v>
<v Speaker 1>sloppy,</v>

55
00:02:50.811 --> 00:02:55.280
<v Speaker 1>repetitive yet in complete fragments,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but before we analyze the world building</v>

56
00:02:55.281 --> 00:02:57.950
<v Speaker 1>strategies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a brief overview of the mythology behind</v>

57
00:02:57.951 --> 00:02:58.784
<v Speaker 1>bright 2000 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something gnarly went down with a dark </v>

58
00:03:01.331 --> 00:03:02.164
<v Speaker 1>Lord.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All your excited with him except this </v>

59
00:03:03.641 --> 00:03:04.474
<v Speaker 1>one ORC Gerard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who somehow united the nine races </v>

60
00:03:06.641 --> 00:03:09.580
<v Speaker 1>together and who are the nine races.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While it's not exactly clear,</v>

61
00:03:09.581 --> 00:03:12.750
<v Speaker 1>we've got the elves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>humans or fairies and for the eagle eyed</v>

62
00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:14.560
<v Speaker 1>viewers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but anyway,</v>

63
00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:17.200
<v Speaker 1>they managed to take down the dark lord </v>
<v Speaker 1>except oops.</v>

64
00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:19.230
<v Speaker 1>Ease ready to come back and all his </v>
<v Speaker 1>demons,</v>

65
00:03:19.231 --> 00:03:21.970
<v Speaker 1>Elvis need to do is bring three ones </v>
<v Speaker 1>together.</v>

66
00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:23.043
<v Speaker 1>Watch out though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Only a bright can hold a one which </v>

67
00:03:25.211 --> 00:03:28.330
<v Speaker 1>creates complications still.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even if the dark Ford does rise,</v>

68
00:03:28.331 --> 00:03:29.164
<v Speaker 1>he can be stopped with magic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That whole subplot never comes to </v>

69
00:03:31.241 --> 00:03:32.074
<v Speaker 1>fruition though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Probably to be saved for the recently </v>

70
00:03:33.551 --> 00:03:37.090
<v Speaker 1>greenlit sequel that will hopefully come</v>
<v Speaker 1>with some clarification now.</v>

71
00:03:37.091 --> 00:03:37.924
<v Speaker 1>It's totally understandable that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>minds behind Brian wanted to veer away </v>

72
00:03:40.391 --> 00:03:44.050
<v Speaker 1>from the dramatically narrated storybook</v>
<v Speaker 1>style opener of Lord of the rings.</v>

73
00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:45.063
<v Speaker 1>It's not exactly the freshest turf in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the screen writing world or it would be </v>

74
00:03:48.461 --> 00:03:49.294
<v Speaker 1>understandable if bright hadn't started </v>
<v Speaker 1>out with an equally cheesy but less </v>

75
00:03:52.151 --> 00:03:52.984
<v Speaker 1>eloquent quote.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That sounds like it came out of a 10 </v>

76
00:03:54.401 --> 00:03:56.470
<v Speaker 1>year old's dungeons and dragons game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>From there,</v>

77
00:03:56.471 --> 00:03:59.200
<v Speaker 1>they have an opening sequence of </v>
<v Speaker 1>cringeworthy tagging.</v>

78
00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:00.273
<v Speaker 1>You would think with $90,000,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can afford to hire a decent la </v>

79
00:04:02.411 --> 00:04:03.250
<v Speaker 1>graffiti artists.</v>

80
00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:05.650
<v Speaker 1>Through this we learned there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>interspecies upheaval,</v>

81
00:04:05.651 --> 00:04:09.130
<v Speaker 1>police brutality and lizard people </v>
<v Speaker 1>roaming the streets.</v>

82
00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:10.063
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty rude to tease the existence </v>

83
00:04:11.141 --> 00:04:13.900
<v Speaker 1>of Lizard people and not the liver,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I digress.</v>

84
00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:17.650
<v Speaker 1>These shots of the street explained some</v>
<v Speaker 1>atmospheric aspects of the film's world,</v>

85
00:04:17.651 --> 00:04:20.020
<v Speaker 1>but we're still missing the cold hard </v>
<v Speaker 1>facts.</v>

86
00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:20.973
<v Speaker 1>For instance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who is the dark lord and what did he do </v>

87
00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:26.110
<v Speaker 1>and why are all the social media </v>
<v Speaker 1>influencers,</v>

88
00:04:26.111 --> 00:04:26.944
<v Speaker 1>elves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We weren't the only people scratching </v>

89
00:04:28.451 --> 00:04:32.230
<v Speaker 1>our heads either after fans expressed </v>
<v Speaker 1>widespread confusion as to what the heck</v>

90
00:04:32.231 --> 00:04:34.030
<v Speaker 1>was going on with all this dark lord </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>

91
00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:34.923
<v Speaker 1>Netflix released what amounted to a two </v>
<v Speaker 1>minute instruction manual for the film </v>

92
00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:39.753
<v Speaker 1>and it's we're given a few thousand </v>
<v Speaker 1>years of magical history with factual </v>

93
00:04:42.311 --> 00:04:44.890
<v Speaker 1>nuggets like Jurek was hailed as the </v>
<v Speaker 1>first,</v>

94
00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:49.150
<v Speaker 1>but if Dirac saved everyone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why do people hate orange so damn much?</v>

95
00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:51.490
<v Speaker 1>And how did this world social order come</v>
<v Speaker 1>about?</v>

96
00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:52.683
<v Speaker 1>This video feels more like a hastily </v>
<v Speaker 1>concocted admission of guilt that this </v>

97
00:04:55.481 --> 00:04:56.314
<v Speaker 1>film was confusing as hell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Another world building issue is the way </v>

98
00:04:59.021 --> 00:04:59.854
<v Speaker 1>the film conveys the limited information</v>
<v Speaker 1>it does tell the audience which brings </v>

99
00:05:02.741 --> 00:05:06.040
<v Speaker 1>us to a fundamental screen writing rule </v>
<v Speaker 1>showing versus telling.</v>

100
00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:09.130
<v Speaker 1>Showing is when a film conveys </v>
<v Speaker 1>information through characters.</v>

101
00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:12.580
<v Speaker 1>Actions telling is when characters chat </v>
<v Speaker 1>about the events of the world,</v>

102
00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:15.520
<v Speaker 1>the narrative equivalent of an Intel </v>
<v Speaker 1>briefing for the audience,</v>

103
00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:16.563
<v Speaker 1>and boy is bright a telephone for route.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The film characters regularly serve as </v>

104
00:05:20.741 --> 00:05:21.574
<v Speaker 1>embedded narrators,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a strategy that swallows the action and </v>

105
00:05:24.281 --> 00:05:26.470
<v Speaker 1>create stiff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unrealistic dialogue.</v>

106
00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:27.513
<v Speaker 1>For instance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the award for worst line in the film </v>

107
00:05:29.321 --> 00:05:31.930
<v Speaker 1>goes to wards daughter in this cringy.</v>

108
00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:35.930
<v Speaker 3>Everybody hates please.</v>

109
00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:38.110
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we get it.</v>

110
00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:40.590
<v Speaker 1>Another prime example comes from ward </v>
<v Speaker 1>early on.</v>

111
00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:41.740
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

112
00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:44.830
<v Speaker 3>I got to do to my car.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The whole world is watching.</v>

113
00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:47.080
<v Speaker 3>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't ask for it.</v>

114
00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:49.260
<v Speaker 3>I don't want it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I don't get a vote.</v>

115
00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:50.263
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this speech is stupendously heavy </v>

116
00:05:51.651 --> 00:05:53.510
<v Speaker 1>handed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody talks like this.</v>

117
00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:54.403
<v Speaker 1>Secondly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these facts can be shown in a natural </v>

118
00:05:56.091 --> 00:05:57.730
<v Speaker 1>way through the narrative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

119
00:05:57.740 --> 00:05:58.573
<v Speaker 1>Ward makes it pretty clear he'd rather </v>
<v Speaker 1>be done by a ferry than right to work </v>

120
00:06:01.611 --> 00:06:02.630
<v Speaker 1>alongside Jacoby,</v>

121
00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:07.890
<v Speaker 4>so I'm in a phase where he just shut up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Don't say anything,</v>

122
00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:09.450
<v Speaker 4>just draw out a word.</v>

123
00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:11.933
<v Speaker 1>Still.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The winner for the most forest proxy </v>

124
00:06:13.741 --> 00:06:14.574
<v Speaker 1>narrator has to be the smelly sword.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wielding bum who goes from trying to </v>

125
00:06:17.701 --> 00:06:20.490
<v Speaker 1>Samurai,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a crowd of people to calmly relaying the</v>

126
00:06:20.491 --> 00:06:23.290
<v Speaker 1>entire world's backstory without even a </v>
<v Speaker 1>shower break.</v>

127
00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:28.820
<v Speaker 1>Nine races shoulder to shoulder to give </v>
<v Speaker 1>you the world you neglect the.</v>

128
00:06:29.001 --> 00:06:29.834
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the dark one returned to reclaim our </v>

129
00:06:33.011 --> 00:06:35.550
<v Speaker 1>carts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then as the feds interrogate him,</v>

130
00:06:35.551 --> 00:06:39.540
<v Speaker 1>he gives a plotting explanation of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>shield of light in Fernie wands.</v>

131
00:06:39.541 --> 00:06:40.374
<v Speaker 1>The dark Lord Layla Tika,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and write this scene is a boring and b </v>

132
00:06:44.910 --> 00:06:45.743
<v Speaker 1>doesn't make sense unless you assume </v>
<v Speaker 1>federal agents in charge of magic crime </v>

133
00:06:49.770 --> 00:06:52.950
<v Speaker 1>are Asfa confused by the rules of their </v>
<v Speaker 1>world as we are.</v>

134
00:06:53.310 --> 00:06:56.880
<v Speaker 1>This strategy continues throughout the </v>
<v Speaker 1>film wants to and ward,</v>

135
00:06:56.881 --> 00:06:59.550
<v Speaker 1>find the magic one and call for backup </v>
<v Speaker 1>for skeezy.</v>

136
00:06:59.551 --> 00:07:03.840
<v Speaker 1>Cops show up and give us another forced </v>
<v Speaker 1>lecture on how magic works.</v>

137
00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:07.840
<v Speaker 4>That's magic right there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's whatever you want.</v>

138
00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:13.150
<v Speaker 4>You want a million dollars,</v>
<v Speaker 4>10 million,</v>

139
00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:17.860
<v Speaker 4>you want to be taller or shorter,</v>
<v Speaker 4>make it bigger.</v>

140
00:07:18.910 --> 00:07:19.743
<v Speaker 4>You want to go back in time and marry </v>
<v Speaker 4>the girl who didn't blow you on prom </v>

141
00:07:21.761 --> 00:07:23.260
<v Speaker 4>night.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's how you do it right there.</v>

142
00:07:23.390 --> 00:07:24.223
<v Speaker 1>They continue to narrate the plot as it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The audience would be absolutely </v>

143
00:07:26.871 --> 00:07:29.820
<v Speaker 1>flummoxed by the concept of dirty cops,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's thrilling.</v>

144
00:07:31.530 --> 00:07:32.630
<v Speaker 4>Two cops die tonight.</v>

145
00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:36.530
<v Speaker 1>It's clearly done for the audience's </v>
<v Speaker 1>sake and it's Corny as hell.</v>

146
00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:37.513
<v Speaker 1>The scripts spooned feeds us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Huge plot points and small details </v>

147
00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:42.710
<v Speaker 1>alike.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like when Ward Jacobian Tika are fleeing</v>

148
00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:45.200
<v Speaker 1>the Mexican gang and ward yells,</v>
<v Speaker 1>windows up.</v>

149
00:07:45.230 --> 00:07:48.350
<v Speaker 1>Bulletproof.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is he patronizing Jacoby or the audience</v>

150
00:07:48.470 --> 00:07:50.840
<v Speaker 1>who even knows just for fun,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they remind us.</v>

151
00:07:52.540 --> 00:07:54.050
<v Speaker 1>Needless Exposition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>head.</v>

152
00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:55.093
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes this tire,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some exposition manages to somehow be </v>

153
00:07:58.041 --> 00:08:00.680
<v Speaker 1>both forced and and complete.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For instance,</v>

154
00:08:00.681 --> 00:08:05.480
<v Speaker 1>Jacoby gives a snooze inducing and </v>
<v Speaker 1>scattered explanation of his orchid idle</v>

155
00:08:05.540 --> 00:08:09.950
<v Speaker 1>Jeruk chemos who changed the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

156
00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:10.540
<v Speaker 1>And</v>

157
00:08:10.540 --> 00:08:15.250
<v Speaker 4>they raised their place to him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was flooded in that very moment.</v>

158
00:08:15.570 --> 00:08:18.270
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so Dirac was a former farmer who was.</v>

159
00:08:18.350 --> 00:08:19.230
<v Speaker 1>Wait,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what was that?</v>

160
00:08:19.830 --> 00:08:20.663
<v Speaker 1>Flooded</v>

161
00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:22.040
<v Speaker 4>in that very moment.</v>

162
00:08:22.340 --> 00:08:23.121
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Seriously,</v>

163
00:08:23.121 --> 00:08:24.680
<v Speaker 1>what is the deal with this flooding </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing?</v>

164
00:08:25.690 --> 00:08:26.523
<v Speaker 4>He's out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's like a finger that got cut off the </v>

165
00:08:30.371 --> 00:08:31.660
<v Speaker 4>hand.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's dead to us.</v>

166
00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:36.080
<v Speaker 1>Jacoby who is not flooded explains that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a sign of honor in the community.</v>

167
00:08:36.340 --> 00:08:37.173
<v Speaker 4>What you did tonight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what it takes for an org to get </v>

168
00:08:40.441 --> 00:08:42.520
<v Speaker 4>blooded,</v>
<v Speaker 4>an active,</v>

169
00:08:42.540 --> 00:08:43.560
<v Speaker 4>great bravery.</v>

170
00:08:43.710 --> 00:08:44.543
<v Speaker 1>So are we supposed to think that all </v>
<v Speaker 1>these other orcs are brave except </v>

171
00:08:46.961 --> 00:08:49.620
<v Speaker 1>Jacoby,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the one who professionally puts his life</v>

172
00:08:49.621 --> 00:08:51.990
<v Speaker 1>in harm's way and what does blooding </v>
<v Speaker 1>even mean?</v>

173
00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:56.580
<v Speaker 1>Jacoby sad dental situation as compared </v>
<v Speaker 1>to his brother and it's definitely tooth</v>

174
00:08:56.581 --> 00:08:57.414
<v Speaker 1>related.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We finally get a peek at this blooding </v>

175
00:08:58.921 --> 00:08:59.754
<v Speaker 1>ritual at the end of the film after </v>
<v Speaker 1>Jacoby Saves Ward and the same orcs who </v>

176
00:09:02.971 --> 00:09:03.804
<v Speaker 1>only half an hour ago killed him slip </v>
<v Speaker 1>their palms because apparently clan </v>

177
00:09:07.531 --> 00:09:09.600
<v Speaker 1>loyalty means never having to say you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>sorry.</v>

178
00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:10.950
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>least that's showing,</v>

179
00:09:10.951 --> 00:09:12.570
<v Speaker 1>not telling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Goldstar.</v>

180
00:09:12.900 --> 00:09:13.733
<v Speaker 1>If only we understood what the heck is </v>
<v Speaker 1>going on or how this crowd of orcs knew </v>

181
00:09:16.471 --> 00:09:18.810
<v Speaker 1>that Jacobi had just committed an act of</v>
<v Speaker 1>bravery.</v>

182
00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:19.913
<v Speaker 1>Is there some kind of work bat signal?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are they just following Jacoby all </v>

183
00:09:22.561 --> 00:09:23.970
<v Speaker 1>night,</v>
<v Speaker 1>waiting to shed blood,</v>

184
00:09:23.971 --> 00:09:27.540
<v Speaker 1>which would magically give jacoby the </v>
<v Speaker 1>perfect or smile on the bright side.</v>

185
00:09:27.541 --> 00:09:29.910
<v Speaker 1>The next day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jacoby does appear to be teething on his</v>

186
00:09:29.911 --> 00:09:32.820
<v Speaker 1>new fangs moving onto head scratcher.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Number two,</v>

187
00:09:33.060 --> 00:09:36.180
<v Speaker 1>hero Shamiro.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whether you're writing about outer space</v>

188
00:09:36.181 --> 00:09:39.120
<v Speaker 1>downtown Baltimore or a wizarding school</v>
<v Speaker 1>in an English castle,</v>

189
00:09:39.150 --> 00:09:44.150
<v Speaker 1>the first ingredient of a good story is </v>
<v Speaker 1>a hero or two or three in bright.</v>

190
00:09:44.461 --> 00:09:45.294
<v Speaker 1>We have ward and Jacoby and neither will</v>
<v Speaker 1>undergo significant character </v>

191
00:09:48.631 --> 00:09:49.464
<v Speaker 1>development over the course of the film.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ward begins the film as a snarky </v>

192
00:09:52.261 --> 00:09:52.710
<v Speaker 1>dickhead.</v>

193
00:09:52.710 --> 00:09:54.270
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you in a box,</v>

194
00:09:54.660 --> 00:09:57.590
<v Speaker 4>I'll probably be like more song</v>

195
00:09:58.510 --> 00:10:02.280
<v Speaker 1>and ends the film as a snarky dickhead </v>
<v Speaker 1>dog.</v>

196
00:10:02.340 --> 00:10:03.520
<v Speaker 1>Now you blooded,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>

197
00:10:03.670 --> 00:10:04.503
<v Speaker 1>Jacoby begins as a toothless,</v>
<v Speaker 1>insecure guy who can't stand up for </v>

198
00:10:06.941 --> 00:10:07.774
<v Speaker 1>himself.</v>

199
00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:09.473
<v Speaker 4>Hold.</v>

200
00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:11.770
<v Speaker 1>Can you make a shootout?</v>

201
00:10:11.890 --> 00:10:15.030
<v Speaker 4>Awkward.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sorry.</v>

202
00:10:15.180 --> 00:10:16.013
<v Speaker 1>And ends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The film has a slightly tooth guy who </v>

203
00:10:18.031 --> 00:10:20.680
<v Speaker 1>ward still treats like a tattooed </v>
<v Speaker 1>forrest gump thing.</v>

204
00:10:20.780 --> 00:10:22.500
<v Speaker 1>The nice federal agents.</v>

205
00:10:24.700 --> 00:10:25.470
<v Speaker 4>Thank you.</v>

206
00:10:25.470 --> 00:10:26.303
<v Speaker 1>Beyond that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for a film centered on an unlikely </v>

207
00:10:27.571 --> 00:10:28.404
<v Speaker 1>friendship,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their relationship also seems pretty </v>

208
00:10:30.181 --> 00:10:31.620
<v Speaker 1>stagnant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At best,</v>

209
00:10:31.621 --> 00:10:35.490
<v Speaker 1>it could be said that ward learns to </v>
<v Speaker 1>tolerate Jacobi and not narc on him,</v>

210
00:10:35.580 --> 00:10:38.040
<v Speaker 1>which is pretty bleak as far as buddy </v>
<v Speaker 1>films go.</v>

211
00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:39.353
<v Speaker 1>It's not surprising.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They never changed because they never </v>

212
00:10:40.891 --> 00:10:42.750
<v Speaker 1>really had character journeys to begin </v>
<v Speaker 1>with.</v>

213
00:10:42.920 --> 00:10:43.753
<v Speaker 1>He number one rule in making a </v>
<v Speaker 1>compelling hero according to Aaron </v>

214
00:10:46.860 --> 00:10:49.110
<v Speaker 1>Sorkin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that somebody's gotta want something.</v>

215
00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:51.480
<v Speaker 1>Something's got to be standing in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>way of getting it.</v>

216
00:10:51.630 --> 00:10:52.463
<v Speaker 1>You do that and you have a seat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eventually you'll have a movie to </v>

217
00:10:55.500 --> 00:10:56.333
<v Speaker 1>Westley wants Princess Buttercup,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ferris bueller wants to cut class and </v>

218
00:10:58.801 --> 00:10:59.634
<v Speaker 1>party and so on and bright,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not so much or doesn't appear to </v>

219
00:11:03.361 --> 00:11:04.194
<v Speaker 1>actively want anything except maybe to </v>
<v Speaker 1>lose Jacoby as his partner and keep his </v>

220
00:11:07.951 --> 00:11:08.784
<v Speaker 1>job without being a corrupt asshole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That said he doesn't pursue those goals </v>

221
00:11:12.001 --> 00:11:13.320
<v Speaker 1>in any meaningful way.</v>

222
00:11:13.470 --> 00:11:16.380
<v Speaker 1>Jacoby does want to be blooded,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but as explained earlier,</v>

223
00:11:16.500 --> 00:11:17.333
<v Speaker 1>we don't really understand what the heck</v>
<v Speaker 1>being blooded is or what it means for </v>

224
00:11:20.401 --> 00:11:21.234
<v Speaker 1>him as a character.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does he have to submit the clan loyalty </v>

225
00:11:23.491 --> 00:11:25.380
<v Speaker 1>to hang out with those Miami orcs?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

226
00:11:25.381 --> 00:11:27.030
<v Speaker 1>they seemed fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While a,</v>

227
00:11:27.031 --> 00:11:27.864
<v Speaker 1>what makes a hero initially compelling </v>
<v Speaker 1>the heroes choices or what makes it </v>

228
00:11:31.321 --> 00:11:32.154
<v Speaker 1>characters stay compelling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>apparently Dustin Hoffman won't even </v>

229
00:11:34.831 --> 00:11:35.664
<v Speaker 1>sign onto a movie unless his character </v>
<v Speaker 1>has no less than 40 points of choice in </v>

230
00:11:39.061 --> 00:11:41.370
<v Speaker 1>the script.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rather than 40 points of choice,</v>

231
00:11:41.460 --> 00:11:42.293
<v Speaker 1>our main guy's face approximately 40 </v>
<v Speaker 1>points of coincidence that saved their </v>

232
00:11:45.331 --> 00:11:46.164
<v Speaker 1>butts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Such a coincidence is called a deus ex </v>

233
00:11:47.971 --> 00:11:48.804
<v Speaker 1>machina or a person or thing that </v>
<v Speaker 1>appears suddenly and provides a </v>

234
00:11:51.331 --> 00:11:54.970
<v Speaker 1>contrived solution to and apparently </v>
<v Speaker 1>insoluble difficulty.</v>

235
00:11:55.180 --> 00:11:58.240
<v Speaker 1>Most notable among these is the one in </v>
<v Speaker 1>one instance,</v>

236
00:11:58.241 --> 00:12:01.900
<v Speaker 1>the wan solves the inconvenience of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Jacoby dying in another awards,</v>

237
00:12:01.901 --> 00:12:02.734
<v Speaker 1>totally random status as a bright turns,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what would have been an act of suicide </v>

238
00:12:06.340 --> 00:12:09.940
<v Speaker 1>into a semi heroic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a 100 percent coincidental fee.</v>

239
00:12:10.300 --> 00:12:12.250
<v Speaker 1>Now for a head scratcher.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Number three,</v>

240
00:12:12.370 --> 00:12:13.203
<v Speaker 1>when a metaphor is a train wreck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bright is littered with unsubtle </v>

241
00:12:16.871 --> 00:12:17.704
<v Speaker 1>metaphors comparing interspecies </v>
<v Speaker 1>discrimination with real world racial </v>

242
00:12:21.221 --> 00:12:22.054
<v Speaker 1>discrimination.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even chance the rapper are called the </v>

243
00:12:23.741 --> 00:12:27.250
<v Speaker 1>metaphor a little shallow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We more than a little degree,</v>

244
00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:29.950
<v Speaker 1>but before we take a deep dive into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>meanings at play,</v>

245
00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:31.840
<v Speaker 1>we want to give the following.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Disclaimer,</v>

246
00:12:31.930 --> 00:12:32.763
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a fictional world in which nine </v>

247
00:12:35.081 --> 00:12:37.720
<v Speaker 1>races coexist with varying levels of </v>
<v Speaker 1>friction.</v>

248
00:12:37.870 --> 00:12:38.703
<v Speaker 1>Maybe the filmmakers had no intention of</v>
<v Speaker 1>it being read as a precise metaphor for </v>

249
00:12:41.921 --> 00:12:42.754
<v Speaker 1>American racial politics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Problem is the movie practically begs </v>

250
00:12:45.761 --> 00:12:46.594
<v Speaker 1>you to draw this comparison.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where's the diversity hire you ride </v>

251
00:12:49.101 --> 00:12:50.200
<v Speaker 1>with?</v>
<v Speaker 1>First off,</v>

252
00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:51.093
<v Speaker 1>it's a film about cops set in La,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a city that was home to one of the </v>

253
00:12:54.041 --> 00:12:54.874
<v Speaker 1>country's most violent race riots ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One which was specifically ignited by </v>

254
00:12:58.271 --> 00:13:00.940
<v Speaker 1>police violence towards black folks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bright,</v>

255
00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:05.770
<v Speaker 1>very deliberately draws comparisons </v>
<v Speaker 1>between orcs and black Americans in ways</v>

256
00:13:05.771 --> 00:13:09.350
<v Speaker 1>that are too obvious to ignore from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>graffiti to the urban street,</v>

257
00:13:09.351 --> 00:13:10.184
<v Speaker 1>wear visual adaptations of black culture</v>
<v Speaker 1>about their marginalized by other races </v>

258
00:13:14.291 --> 00:13:15.124
<v Speaker 1>in society and face victimization at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>hands of the police in truly </v>

259
00:13:18.431 --> 00:13:19.264
<v Speaker 1>sophisticated symbolism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The films that just the cops would </v>

260
00:13:21.161 --> 00:13:22.840
<v Speaker 1>definitely kill the hooded or</v>

261
00:13:22.950 --> 00:13:26.560
<v Speaker 5>and the troops are coming up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Humans with gone looking for new.</v>

262
00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:30.810
<v Speaker 5>Who shot a cop.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You pick that kid had a chance</v>

263
00:13:30.920 --> 00:13:33.530
<v Speaker 1>just for fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One ORC tells Jacoby your buddies,</v>

264
00:13:33.531 --> 00:13:34.364
<v Speaker 1>so happy to say he's got an ORC friend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not knowing that ward very dramatically </v>

265
00:13:38.750 --> 00:13:41.240
<v Speaker 1>doesn't do friends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't want me as a friend.</v>

266
00:13:41.690 --> 00:13:42.560
<v Speaker 1>Oh Jeez,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

267
00:13:42.620 --> 00:13:43.453
<v Speaker 1>save it for your art therapist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That metaphor is referenced most </v>

268
00:13:45.981 --> 00:13:49.940
<v Speaker 1>disturbingly when Jacoby is hung by a </v>
<v Speaker 1>rope during a fight scene with an Elf.</v>

269
00:13:50.180 --> 00:13:51.013
<v Speaker 1>I don't need to spell out why.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Putting a character that has been </v>

270
00:13:52.731 --> 00:13:56.660
<v Speaker 1>signified as black in this situation is </v>
<v Speaker 1>more than a little messed up.</v>

271
00:13:56.990 --> 00:13:57.823
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and one very important distinction </v>

272
00:13:59.211 --> 00:14:00.044
<v Speaker 1>between ORCS and black Americans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>ORCS apparently caused their oppression </v>

273
00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:04.610
<v Speaker 1>or at least their great,</v>
<v Speaker 1>great,</v>

274
00:14:04.611 --> 00:14:05.444
<v Speaker 1>great,</v>
<v Speaker 1>great grand daddies did when they </v>

275
00:14:06.681 --> 00:14:11.250
<v Speaker 1>decided to side with the dark Lord Lord,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a long time ago,</v>

276
00:14:11.251 --> 00:14:13.670
<v Speaker 1>and navient paid for it ever since.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Needless to say,</v>

277
00:14:13.850 --> 00:14:16.280
<v Speaker 1>real racial prejudice does not work that</v>
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>

278
00:14:16.400 --> 00:14:19.490
<v Speaker 1>I eat black Americans have zero sins to </v>
<v Speaker 1>pay for.</v>

279
00:14:19.730 --> 00:14:21.470
<v Speaker 1>When you're making a metaphor about </v>
<v Speaker 1>race,</v>

280
00:14:21.530 --> 00:14:22.363
<v Speaker 1>it's important to be very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very precise because there's a real </v>

281
00:14:25.161 --> 00:14:25.994
<v Speaker 1>danger that an ill conceived metaphor </v>
<v Speaker 1>can muddle an already complicated </v>

282
00:14:29.271 --> 00:14:30.104
<v Speaker 1>conversation to understand why.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's examine the cognitive function of </v>

283
00:14:33.321 --> 00:14:35.990
<v Speaker 1>metaphors in there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Influential book metaphors.</v>

284
00:14:35.991 --> 00:14:39.530
<v Speaker 1>We live by scholars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>George Lakoff and Mark Johnson explained</v>

285
00:14:39.531 --> 00:14:43.460
<v Speaker 1>that metaphors are vital to human beings</v>
<v Speaker 1>understanding of the world around us.</v>

286
00:14:43.610 --> 00:14:44.443
<v Speaker 1>That's because metaphors are a way of </v>
<v Speaker 1>taking a human's understanding of a </v>

287
00:14:46.971 --> 00:14:47.804
<v Speaker 1>simple,</v>
<v Speaker 1>often physically tangible concept and </v>

288
00:14:49.581 --> 00:14:52.130
<v Speaker 1>transferring that understanding onto </v>
<v Speaker 1>another poor,</v>

289
00:14:52.131 --> 00:14:52.964
<v Speaker 1>complicated concept,</v>
<v Speaker 1>often one hidden from our senses or </v>

290
00:14:55.461 --> 00:14:57.830
<v Speaker 1>difficult to explain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>play golf and Johnson.</v>

291
00:14:57.860 --> 00:14:59.870
<v Speaker 1>Are you then when we make a metaphor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

292
00:14:59.871 --> 00:15:00.704
<v Speaker 1>comparing madness to love.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're not just momentarily linking to </v>

293
00:15:03.531 --> 00:15:04.364
<v Speaker 1>ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're also transferring an extensive </v>

294
00:15:06.441 --> 00:15:07.274
<v Speaker 1>array of our cognitive associations </v>
<v Speaker 1>about what constitutes madness onto </v>

295
00:15:10.520 --> 00:15:11.690
<v Speaker 1>love.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As a result,</v>

296
00:15:11.691 --> 00:15:12.524
<v Speaker 1>a human struggling to write a Valentine </v>
<v Speaker 1>card can explain why they have </v>

297
00:15:15.441 --> 00:15:16.730
<v Speaker 1>butterflies in their belly.</v>

298
00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:19.850
<v Speaker 1>As a result,</v>
<v Speaker 1>metaphors may create realities for us,</v>

299
00:15:19.910 --> 00:15:23.900
<v Speaker 1>especially social realities leading us </v>
<v Speaker 1>to view the metaphor as being true.</v>

300
00:15:24.050 --> 00:15:26.120
<v Speaker 1>So in this case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lovers be cray.</v>

301
00:15:26.330 --> 00:15:28.730
<v Speaker 1>So what does all this have to do with </v>
<v Speaker 1>fictional orcs?</v>

302
00:15:28.820 --> 00:15:29.653
<v Speaker 1>When a film like bright unsubtly evokes </v>
<v Speaker 1>a metaphor that transfers the viewer's </v>

303
00:15:33.021 --> 00:15:36.680
<v Speaker 1>understanding of the inhuman orcs onto </v>
<v Speaker 1>black Americans,</v>

304
00:15:36.830 --> 00:15:37.663
<v Speaker 1>they inherently invite the possibility </v>
<v Speaker 1>that viewers will transfer all their </v>

305
00:15:40.461 --> 00:15:43.190
<v Speaker 1>cognitive associations about what </v>
<v Speaker 1>constitutes orcs,</v>

306
00:15:43.280 --> 00:15:45.350
<v Speaker 1>a race of homogenous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>inarticulate,</v>

307
00:15:45.351 --> 00:15:49.910
<v Speaker 1>tattooed gangsters onto that of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>extremely complex and most importantly,</v>

308
00:15:49.911 --> 00:15:50.744
<v Speaker 1>human group of black Americans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not like bright is going to </v>

309
00:15:53.481 --> 00:15:54.314
<v Speaker 1>radically harm race relations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this practice does place it </v>

310
00:15:56.631 --> 00:15:57.464
<v Speaker 1>somewhere in an ugly history of American</v>
<v Speaker 1>cinema comparing people of color to </v>

311
00:16:00.620 --> 00:16:03.320
<v Speaker 1>inhuman creatures.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Before we go further into this,</v>

312
00:16:03.380 --> 00:16:06.200
<v Speaker 1>it's important to address the colorblind</v>
<v Speaker 1>elephant in the room.</v>

313
00:16:06.320 --> 00:16:07.153
<v Speaker 1>Bright depicts a world where a black man</v>
<v Speaker 1>of wards status can exist seemingly </v>

314
00:16:10.671 --> 00:16:13.550
<v Speaker 1>without facing bigotry or to quote </v>
<v Speaker 1>chance the rapper.</v>

315
00:16:13.700 --> 00:16:14.533
<v Speaker 1>Racism has gone because we hate ORC.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now that's messed up more so even when </v>

316
00:16:18.261 --> 00:16:20.870
<v Speaker 1>you couple it with wards,</v>
<v Speaker 1>treatment of marginalized creatures,</v>

317
00:16:20.990 --> 00:16:24.230
<v Speaker 1>all of which have OIC treatment of black</v>
<v Speaker 1>Americans by police officers.</v>

318
00:16:24.440 --> 00:16:28.760
<v Speaker 1>Whether he's saying very lives don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>matter today or watching a bunch of orcs</v>

319
00:16:28.761 --> 00:16:32.560
<v Speaker 1>get beat up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then asking Jacoby Your Cup first.</v>

320
00:16:34.700 --> 00:16:35.533
<v Speaker 1>It just feels odd in a country where </v>
<v Speaker 1>violence against black men by police </v>

321
00:16:38.901 --> 00:16:39.734
<v Speaker 1>officers remains heartbreakingly common </v>
<v Speaker 1>depicting a black cop this way just </v>

322
00:16:43.311 --> 00:16:45.830
<v Speaker 1>feels way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>way off the mark wards.</v>

323
00:16:45.831 --> 00:16:46.664
<v Speaker 1>Character seems to be there to both </v>
<v Speaker 1>protect the film against charges of </v>

324
00:16:49.221 --> 00:16:50.054
<v Speaker 1>racism because how can a movie be racist</v>
<v Speaker 1>when it shows a black man as equal and </v>

325
00:16:53.511 --> 00:16:54.344
<v Speaker 1>even getting to be racist himself and </v>
<v Speaker 1>make a backwards argument about how far </v>

326
00:16:57.771 --> 00:17:01.430
<v Speaker 1>black America has come through an </v>
<v Speaker 1>individual representation of a black man</v>

327
00:17:01.431 --> 00:17:02.264
<v Speaker 1>who's made it and earned respect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now back to the specifics of the films </v>

328
00:17:05.901 --> 00:17:08.150
<v Speaker 1>depiction of Orcs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which makes it even more.</v>

329
00:17:08.710 --> 00:17:11.900
<v Speaker 1>While Jacoby is an honorable guy with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>working moral compass.</v>

330
00:17:11.990 --> 00:17:15.620
<v Speaker 1>His depiction is not particularly </v>
<v Speaker 1>flattering for starters,</v>

331
00:17:15.770 --> 00:17:19.250
<v Speaker 1>and there's no easy way to say this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jacoby is not the sharpest,</v>

332
00:17:19.730 --> 00:17:20.563
<v Speaker 1>most painfully obvious near the end of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the film would Jacobi cannot stop </v>

333
00:17:23.151 --> 00:17:26.750
<v Speaker 1>spilling incriminating evidence to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>two federal agents turn turned around,</v>

334
00:17:27.090 --> 00:17:27.923
<v Speaker 1>just rocked the film.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Doesn't make it better when ward tells </v>

335
00:17:32.721 --> 00:17:35.990
<v Speaker 1>his daughter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All of the races are different.</v>

336
00:17:36.110 --> 00:17:36.943
<v Speaker 1>While there is something to be said for </v>
<v Speaker 1>respecting ethnic and cultural </v>

337
00:17:39.021 --> 00:17:39.854
<v Speaker 1>differences,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wards comments seemed to suggest the </v>

338
00:17:41.331 --> 00:17:45.840
<v Speaker 1>existence of actual biological racial </v>
<v Speaker 1>differences to have mad,</v>

339
00:17:46.280 --> 00:17:47.113
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>

340
00:17:48.830 --> 00:17:49.850
<v Speaker 1>Excuse me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Her,</v>

341
00:17:49.910 --> 00:17:50.010
<v Speaker 1>the</v>

342
00:17:50.010 --> 00:17:52.320
<v Speaker 6>detective.</v>
<v Speaker 6>How many dogs play pro basketball?</v>

343
00:17:52.350 --> 00:17:53.970
<v Speaker 6>None.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They're slow.</v>

344
00:17:53.971 --> 00:17:56.370
<v Speaker 6>They're heavy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's why half the NFL defensive lines.</v>

345
00:17:57.110 --> 00:17:58.470
<v Speaker 6>It's not racist to physics.</v>

346
00:17:58.860 --> 00:17:59.693
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're fictional characters who are </v>

347
00:18:00.511 --> 00:18:01.344
<v Speaker 1>literally have different species,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the metaphor is still evokes black </v>

348
00:18:03.781 --> 00:18:04.614
<v Speaker 1>Americans and it feels plain weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That coupled with Jacoby's clear </v>

349
00:18:08.221 --> 00:18:09.054
<v Speaker 1>inability to match words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>intellect which falls into the trap of </v>

350
00:18:11.371 --> 00:18:12.204
<v Speaker 1>evoking hundreds of years of junk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>racist biology that tried to excuse </v>

351
00:18:15.391 --> 00:18:19.140
<v Speaker 1>racism on the grounds that people of </v>
<v Speaker 1>color were intellectually inferior.</v>

352
00:18:19.290 --> 00:18:20.123
<v Speaker 1>At the same time giving orcs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they super strong sense of smell gives </v>

353
00:18:22.591 --> 00:18:23.424
<v Speaker 1>them an animalistic quality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That again makes the metaphor super </v>

354
00:18:26.281 --> 00:18:27.114
<v Speaker 1>ugly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>particularly when you consider the </v>

355
00:18:28.081 --> 00:18:28.914
<v Speaker 1>hundreds of years of white Americans </v>
<v Speaker 1>treating black Americans like sub human </v>

356
00:18:31.471 --> 00:18:34.550
<v Speaker 1>beings as lakoff and Johnson explained </v>
<v Speaker 1>what is it?</v>

357
00:18:34.560 --> 00:18:37.470
<v Speaker 1>Issue is not the truth or falsity of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>metaphor,</v>

358
00:18:37.590 --> 00:18:38.423
<v Speaker 1>but the perceptions and inferences that </v>
<v Speaker 1>follow from it and the actions that are </v>

359
00:18:41.311 --> 00:18:42.144
<v Speaker 1>sanctioned by it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Metaphors like the one in bright in </v>

360
00:18:44.521 --> 00:18:45.354
<v Speaker 1>comparing people of color to in human </v>
<v Speaker 1>beings are up even if they had good </v>

361
00:18:48.961 --> 00:18:51.720
<v Speaker 1>intentions and as lake often Johnson </v>
<v Speaker 1>explained,</v>

362
00:18:51.840 --> 00:18:56.460
<v Speaker 1>we define our reality in terms of </v>
<v Speaker 1>metaphors and then proceed to act though</v>

363
00:18:56.461 --> 00:19:00.120
<v Speaker 1>it makes some superficial points about </v>
<v Speaker 1>tolerance and encourages the audience to</v>

364
00:19:00.121 --> 00:19:02.880
<v Speaker 1>empathize with Jacoby's experience of </v>
<v Speaker 1>marginalization,</v>

365
00:19:02.881 --> 00:19:04.860
<v Speaker 1>abusive friendships and kick me signs.</v>

366
00:19:04.920 --> 00:19:09.210
<v Speaker 1>Brights overarching metaphor is just </v>
<v Speaker 1>plain sloppy brights.</v>

367
00:19:09.211 --> 00:19:10.044
<v Speaker 1>Let us down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but given our world of inevitable </v>

368
00:19:12.031 --> 00:19:13.230
<v Speaker 1>sequels,</v>
<v Speaker 1>prequels,</v>

369
