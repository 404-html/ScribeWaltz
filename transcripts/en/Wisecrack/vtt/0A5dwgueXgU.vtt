1
00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:06.583
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2
00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:08.770
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just justice for me.</v>

3
00:00:08.771 --> 00:00:10.690
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the reasons I love Shakespeare is</v>

4
00:00:10.691 --> 00:00:11.920
<v Speaker 2>that justice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5
00:00:11.921 --> 00:00:12.754
<v Speaker 2>I could say back to you at that level of</v>
<v Speaker 2>abstraction will justice is about </v>

6
00:00:15.941 --> 00:00:18.600
<v Speaker 2>fundamental fairness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Justice is about equality,</v>

7
00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:21.640
<v Speaker 2>know among people who are similarly </v>
<v Speaker 2>situated,</v>

8
00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:22.503
<v Speaker 2>justices about due process of law.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I think precisely why I'm driven to </v>

9
00:00:26.291 --> 00:00:27.124
<v Speaker 2>Shakespeare is because I don't think the</v>
<v Speaker 2>conversation really helps anybody at </v>

10
00:00:31.331 --> 00:00:32.164
<v Speaker 2>that level of generality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we really need to think about </v>

11
00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:39.660
<v Speaker 2>particular stories in particular case </v>
<v Speaker 2>studies in particular mythologies.</v>

12
00:00:39.671 --> 00:00:42.670
<v Speaker 2>And one of the regrets that I have </v>
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>

13
00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:46.210
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the otherwise wonderful nature of the,</v>

14
00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:47.283
<v Speaker 2>of American diversity is that our </v>
<v Speaker 2>heterogeneity means that we have very </v>

15
00:00:50.741 --> 00:00:54.760
<v Speaker 2>few common mythologies left to us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what I'm trying to do,</v>

16
00:00:54.761 --> 00:00:55.594
<v Speaker 2>and Shakespeare is to try and say in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>same way that I would say to a law </v>

17
00:00:59.261 --> 00:01:00.094
<v Speaker 2>school class about a case,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I want to make this more available </v>

18
00:01:02.021 --> 00:01:04.720
<v Speaker 2>to people who haven't gone to law school</v>
<v Speaker 2>and don't want to go to law school.</v>

19
00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:06.220
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's read the merchant,</v>

20
00:01:06.221 --> 00:01:07.054
<v Speaker 2>read the merchant of Venice to me with </v>
<v Speaker 2>together with me against measure for </v>

21
00:01:09.491 --> 00:01:10.300
<v Speaker 2>measure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

22
00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:11.133
<v Speaker 2>and the merchant of Venice is really </v>
<v Speaker 2>about a law that a society that takes </v>

23
00:01:15.371 --> 00:01:16.204
<v Speaker 2>law too seriously,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like takes a letter of the law too </v>

24
00:01:17.951 --> 00:01:19.300
<v Speaker 2>seriously,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is to say,</v>

25
00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:22.420
<v Speaker 2>Charlotte says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want my pound of flesh.</v>

26
00:01:22.421 --> 00:01:23.254
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the court of Venice is open to all </v>

27
00:01:25.211 --> 00:01:27.070
<v Speaker 2>comers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a cosmopolitan society.</v>

28
00:01:27.071 --> 00:01:27.904
<v Speaker 2>It's a market society.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it interprets that contract really </v>

29
00:01:29.951 --> 00:01:31.030
<v Speaker 2>strictly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And in fact,</v>

30
00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:34.930
<v Speaker 2>this is in the play,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is to say because this is a market</v>

31
00:01:34.931 --> 00:01:37.840
<v Speaker 2>open to all comers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people would lose faith in the law if we</v>

32
00:01:37.841 --> 00:01:40.060
<v Speaker 2>didn't interpret all contracts really </v>
<v Speaker 2>strictly.</v>

33
00:01:40.061 --> 00:01:40.894
<v Speaker 2>And so therefore sharla because entitled</v>
<v Speaker 2>to Antonio's pound of flesh and nobody </v>

34
00:01:44.381 --> 00:01:46.390
<v Speaker 2>wants to live in that society,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

35
00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:47.673
<v Speaker 2>On the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it can't be that when portia says the </v>

36
00:01:50.081 --> 00:01:53.380
<v Speaker 2>quality of mercy is not strained to drop</v>
<v Speaker 2>the pith of gentle rain from having upon</v>

37
00:01:53.381 --> 00:01:56.020
<v Speaker 2>the place beneath and she has this great</v>
<v Speaker 2>encomium to mercy,</v>

38
00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:00.460
<v Speaker 2>that mercy is what it's all about and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that all we need as an answer to this is</v>

39
00:02:00.461 --> 00:02:01.294
<v Speaker 2>to be merciful to each other because </v>
<v Speaker 2>what real mercy would mean would really </v>

40
00:02:05.831 --> 00:02:08.350
<v Speaker 2>be something that would strike at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>very heart of law.</v>

41
00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:10.900
<v Speaker 2>And that's measure for measure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Duke at the beginning of measure for</v>

42
00:02:10.901 --> 00:02:12.640
<v Speaker 2>measure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just so people know,</v>

43
00:02:12.641 --> 00:02:15.610
<v Speaker 2>since this is a less familiar play,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a duke of Vienna.</v>

44
00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:19.300
<v Speaker 2>He has law,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the law fall into utter disrepair.</v>

45
00:02:19.301 --> 00:02:23.870
<v Speaker 2>So he just hasn't enforced the law and </v>
<v Speaker 2>so lawlessness is sweeping the land.</v>

46
00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:24.733
<v Speaker 2>Then my favorite line is the baby beats </v>
<v Speaker 2>a nurse like this is a world out of </v>

47
00:02:27.521 --> 00:02:28.121
<v Speaker 2>joint.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

48
00:02:28.121 --> 00:02:28.954
<v Speaker 2>hierarchy has been disrupted and so he </v>
<v Speaker 2>essentially leaves and leaves the </v>

49
00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:35.050
<v Speaker 2>leaves,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a really strict a deputy and as place to</v>

50
00:02:35.051 --> 00:02:38.080
<v Speaker 2>enforce the law,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the deputy himself ends up violating</v>

51
00:02:38.081 --> 00:02:40.510
<v Speaker 2>a law and then the dude comes in and </v>
<v Speaker 2>restores order.</v>

52
00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:41.793
<v Speaker 2>But at the very end.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But Duke like issues all these pardons </v>

53
00:02:44.831 --> 00:02:47.050
<v Speaker 2>to everybody who's broken the law all </v>
<v Speaker 2>over again.</v>

54
00:02:47.051 --> 00:02:47.884
<v Speaker 2>So at the end of the play,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or we're no better off than we were at </v>

55
00:02:49.451 --> 00:02:50.284
<v Speaker 2>the beginning.</v>

56
00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:51.423
<v Speaker 2>So both the merchant and metric or </v>
<v Speaker 2>measure or describe worlds to us in </v>

57
00:02:54.971 --> 00:02:57.250
<v Speaker 2>which neither of us would want to live </v>
<v Speaker 2>that no,</v>

58
00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:59.910
<v Speaker 2>no one would want to live in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because you know,</v>

59
00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:03.730
<v Speaker 2>the merchant of Venice doesn't have </v>
<v Speaker 2>enough mercy measure for measure has too</v>

60
00:03:03.731 --> 00:03:06.700
<v Speaker 2>much marcy and no law.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what is the answer to that?</v>

61
00:03:06.701 --> 00:03:09.580
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that there's any easy </v>
<v Speaker 2>answer that says,</v>

62
00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:11.100
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to titrate,</v>

63
00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:12.070
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mercy and,</v>

64
00:03:12.071 --> 00:03:12.904
<v Speaker 2>and the letter of the law if such a way </v>
<v Speaker 2>that we're going to have the perfect </v>

65
00:03:14.861 --> 00:03:16.180
<v Speaker 2>balance and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>

66
00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:18.850
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>two to one ratio of letter of the law to</v>

67
00:03:18.851 --> 00:03:20.920
<v Speaker 2>mercy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like that's never going to be the case.</v>

68
00:03:20.921 --> 00:03:23.740
<v Speaker 2>It's going to hatch that actually be on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the ground and with contacts.</v>

69
00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:27.130
<v Speaker 2>But I think that looking at our common </v>
<v Speaker 2>mythologies,</v>

70
00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:28.143
<v Speaker 2>it's going to help us understand that </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the reason that we have these </v>

71
00:03:30.491 --> 00:03:35.491
<v Speaker 2>stories so that we understand that as </v>
<v Speaker 2>justice Oliver Wendell Holmes on sad and</v>

72
00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:38.140
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the life of the law is not logic.</v>

73
00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:40.330
<v Speaker 2>It's experience and it's experience of </v>
<v Speaker 2>these stories.</v>

74
00:03:40.331 --> 00:03:43.600
<v Speaker 2>It's a fine grained every day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

75
00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:45.640
<v Speaker 2>muddy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>murky,</v>

76
00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:46.680
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

77
00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:47.513
<v Speaker 2>a nature of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of life itself that we somehow have to </v>

78
00:03:49.841 --> 00:03:52.330
<v Speaker 2>make sense of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the answer is not going to be,</v>

79
00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:53.343
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we should have the strict letter of the </v>

80
00:03:54.071 --> 00:03:55.510
<v Speaker 2>law,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or we should have,</v>

81
00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:57.340
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>overflowing mercy.</v>

82
00:03:57.341 --> 00:03:58.174
<v Speaker 2>Because neither of those is going to end</v>
<v Speaker 2>up in a society in which we want to </v>

83
00:04:00.011 --> 00:04:00.844
<v Speaker 2>live.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I'm trying to find that middle </v>

84
00:04:02.111 --> 00:04:02.944
<v Speaker 2>space.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're not going to be able to do that </v>

85
00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:07.330
<v Speaker 2>through any kind of scientific formula.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not an algorithm.</v>

86
00:04:07.331 --> 00:04:08.164
<v Speaker 2>It's not Algebra.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're going to actually have to talk </v>

87
00:04:09.251 --> 00:04:11.340
<v Speaker 2>about culture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's what I'm trying to do.</v>
